Congratulations, Learner. You cracked your first case. Thank you, Lieutenant Hickey. Learned a lot from you, sir. You knew. Didn't you? If I was in Mike's shoes, I might have done the same thing he did. And slept well. These guys put their lives on the line every single day hunting down assholes. We sleep good at night, because these guys deal with the ugly shit, so we don't have to. That's why the rules matter. I'm after the truth. The truth is that sometimes the department doesn't protect your family after you spent your whole life protecting everybody else's. Cops. Most of them are good people. Good men and women. But when a police officer comes from war, they're a different kind of cop. Their life, their job... They'll never be the same again. Doing what's gotta be done takes on a different meaning, and another type of war starts. Where are you hit? How are we gonna get out of here? A helicopter. What do you think? After a few years of active duty, Thornton and Moran joined the New York City Police Department as undercover narcotics cops during the crack epidemic of the nineties. They went from eating sand to pounding the pavement under yours truly. They can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. But wherever they went, you always knew they'd be in it together. Only death was gonna separate those two. Hey, hermano,relax. We're just having some fun. You don't get high on your own supply, cabrón. Hey, hey. Let's go. Hey, yo, I-- I seen it. They're all in there waving it around, shit-bragging. There's a lot of motherfuckers up in and out of there all high and shit. What's he wearing? What's up with his girl? I-- I don't know, man. You-- I don't know. It's gray, black, some-- some shit. I don't know, man. I didn't-- I didn't catch that. Gracias.You stay low. Yeah. All right. Our guy's there. He got a buddy in there. You ready? Another day, another door. Entry to the leader. CI states two suspects present. Possession of gun. Rock and roll, boss. Unit, stand by for the green. Hey, yo, Papi.You good? - Yeah, I'm good. You the same? - Yeah? Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Anyone holding? What you want? I want you to kiss that motherfucking concrete. Yeah, nigga. Yeah, drop that shit, huh. Don't fuck around. Yeah, spread that shit. - What you got on you, motherfucker? - Ain't got shit. Don't lie, nigga. What the fuck you got? Hmm? Told you I ain't got shit, man. What the fuck is this? Okay. Okay. Lie now. Put your hands behind your back. Don't fucking move. Got your ass now. Front secure. Okay, unit. You got the green. Police! Raise your hands! Raise your hands! Get down! Get down on your back! Everybody down! Okay, okay! Who are these fucking-- Shut your fucking mouth! Get the fuck out! Where are you going so fast, flaco? Fucking! Shut your mouth! Shut your fucking goddamn mouth! - What's her story? - She's bragging about her boyfriend - fucking killing a cop. - Tom, Tom. It's not worth it. He's a cop killer. We need the case. Jimmy O? What's been going on with your guy? He's got a car-alarm remote. No keys. Wanna give it a whirl? Sure. Stand by. One of our cops is dead. Benito, you're looking at life for killing a cop, and that is a long-ass stretch of 22. But I didn't kill no cop. Hey, I believe you, but you was there. So you're swinging with your boy, unless you own this. You make yourself look good by saying, "Yes, I am a drug dealer." You know? "But I don't kill cops." And then you tell us what Renaldo did, and you got another big problem. We found a ton of shit in your crib, so we need your connect. I don't wanna sell drugs. I've got a kid. I need to feed my family. There's things I gotta do, man. Hey, man, I'm listening. I'm not judging you. We all do what we gotta do for our family, even if that means that doing what's right by them ain't exactly right. But you're not doing them any good if you go away, right? So, give me the cop killer and your connect, and I will make this right with the DA. When I say I'm gonna do something, I see it through to the end. Chayo. Good fucking job. Hey. Write down what Chayo did to that cop. Do you want, uh, soda or something? Yo. What's up? You were looking to hook me up, even though I did wrong? There's all kinds of rights and wrongs in this world. You know, sometimes you gotta do a smaller wrong for a bigger right. You got a dead cop's gun, your teeth in his nightstick, and you don't wanna say anything. What am I gonna say? I did it? Benito's gonna say you did. Okay. So? Whatever. Or maybe there's something else you wanna share. It's okay. Go to court. Take my chance. Your girlfriend said Chayo killed the cop. You're gonna die in jail. Hey, cop, we all dead, okay? Five, ten, maybe 50 years, but we all die sometime. Doesn't matter. You made me miss my Yankees game. I'm here, I'm old, and I'm pissed. I just had to listen to the CO of Homicide cry in my ear like some kind of jilted bitch because you didn't notify him of the warrant. Honestly, we got a tip from a confidential informant about a stash house, a large quantity, possibly some weapons, and it was moving soon. Yeah, it was just one of those things. One of those things, smart-ass? - Yeah. - How about one of these things? Wrongfully or failure to, because Homicide wants me to put you on paper, and if I start any sentence with either or both of those things, you two won't see another vacation day until the next good president gets in. I checked with the search warrant registry, but there's no sworn affidavit. So what I don't know is if he did or didn't tell you about the shooter before the warrant was issued. Boss, CI-4622 has confidential informant status, which means it's not required. Yeah, and I can't talk to your informant, so it's your word against homicide, and personally, I could give a rat's ass. We're trying to put a cop killer behind bars. That's gotta be more important than a fucking phone call. Oh, I agree. But you guys didn't know before you entered the room that there was a couple of cop killers in there, did you? A last-minute tip from a CI about a stash getting ready to move, so we jumped. It wasn't until we found the gun and the broken teeth that we got suspicious. There's certain protocols that have to be followed, Detective Thornton, you know, but, you know... - What do I know? - Yes, sir. - I mean... - Keep your nose clean. Dad, can I hold your baseball mitt? Baseball players call it a "glove," not a "mitt." The glove. I won two state championships pitching with this old thing before I joined the Marines. - Ready to play ball? - Yeah. All right, Mark. Let's show your old man what you got. All right. Ready? Again. Whoo. Again. Good. Now, the fastball. What's wrong, Dad? Hey, you all right? Yeah. - You gotta go to a doctor, baby. - Yeah. You've had this thing for a week. You sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. - I'm fine. Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. All right. You ready? Take your stance. Target, not your mom. - Good boy. Again. - There you go. And again. Dad, when can we go pitch off a real mound? When I got time. I'd fooled myself into thinking the doctor would tell me it was something else. The tests don't lie. This was the third time this week I've pissed blood. My father died of the same thing about this age. You can't really say civilian life was agreeing with me in those days. Besides my partner, I had nothing but booze and a stripper. I envied Moran and his family. I had no clue he was in a worse place than me. Hey, Ginger, come home with me. Come home, baby. Let's go. Come on. It's my night with the kid, Mikey. Mike, they're gonna cut you off. Hey, buddy. Hey, Dad. Can I sleep on the couch tonight? Are you gonna be here in the morning when I wake up? Of course I'm gonna be here and, yes, you can sleep on the couch. - I love you. - I love you too. I'm gonna go to bed. You talked to your CI, Señor, or whatever the fuck his secret squirrel name is? He missed his meet. Since when are junkies punctual? Never. Hey, uh, is boss gonna come up with the money if we need to make a buy? Yeah. Yeah, just lay it out, and I'll give it to you when you get here. I don't have that kind of cash. Here. Great. - See ya. Later. - Later. Look who it is. Hey, hey. How's the good life, Frankie? I'm getting by. Man, you know what, I look forward to the golden years, you know? When I can just sit around drinking on my fat-ass pension all day. Fat pension? I'm drinking Bud Light over here. I'm feeling generous today. Get him a shot. Thank you, Michael. What's it like? - What's what, like? - The moon. The pension. Well, it's like shit on rye. No. Strike that. Even worse. Say it how it is. Oh, yeah, well, wait till you're living off half a salary clipping coupons like your grandmother. I fucking do. Only hitting the bars that have senior discounts. Might as well be dead. But I can't, right? Because, well, I got debt. And I got a kid, so I gotta watch out. I don't wanna leave it back. But some days I think, "Hey, maybe I should have been taken out in the line of duty." Huh. Well, that's a first, a cop wanting to die in the line of duty. It's a game-changer, I'll tell you that much. - Keep 'em coming for this guy. - Do you know that the city pays the widow half a mil on top of what the pension gives? And then the union throws in a chunk of change. And then they got that, uh, Widows and Orphans Fund. And they got all kinds of scholarships-- Thank you, honey. All kinds of scholarships up the yin-yang. The bottom line that I see is that the family gets paid, but you paid the bill. Yeah. A pension worth a hundred percent of your salary, 400 grand in state and federal tax benefits, right? Free life insurance. Free in-state college tuition for my kid. Now, my boy, he won't talk to me, but that would have been something, right? That would have been something for me to leave him. That's all. Yeah. I think I'm gonna go smoke outside. Thank you, Michael. Jesus Christ. Fuck's wrong with you? Life. Señor. It's him? Yeah. Thank you, Soph. Ah, shit. Señor, how many fucking days you been out, man? I ain't dead, man. You got my money? Yeah. We got your money. Take it in. I ain't shit to y'all, right? I'm just a fucking skell. Why are you saying that? We've never treated you like a skell. You know that. What's wrong? It's over, man. It's all over. Hey, listen. Any day you want out, we got a bed waiting for you in rehab. I told you that. Ah, see, I can't-- I can't never get out of this. - That's not true. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is. I got AIDS, man. Fuck, man. I ain't making it to Christmas, kid. I got a daughter. I got a wife. I'm just glad she threw my junky ass out before I could infect her. You know? You know why I always like to come here? This spot? See, back in the day, I was, uh... I was gonna join the Navy. You know? And now, uh... I ain't got shit to leave my family. You know, I give these motherfuckers up... so that maybe they won't fuck up some other kid's life like they did mine. We've been saving this for you, just in case you ever decide to kick it. Shit, uh... I knew you was light when you hit me off, but, uh... just figured it went back in your pocket. No, man, it's a savings plan for retirement. You, uh, you still got that address in Puerto Rico? Yeah. Send it there. My, uh... My daughter and my wife, they're with the mom's, you know, I... I gotta do right by 'em, you know? Anything else? The... Don't-- don't tell 'em who-- who it's from, all right? Anything else we can do? Yeah, let me hold your gun for a second. You don't mean that. Yeah, I do. Almost jumped in front of a fucking train today. Right, right, right. Look, uh... Let's meet back here, same time tomorrow night Yeah. Fuck, man. What do you say to that, huh? Take it on the chin. That's all you can do. He's not the only one who's not gonna make it to Christmas. I got stomach cancer. Had it for a while. Bullshit. What doctor did you see? Three of them. Fuck. What are the options? Out of options. Surgery? No time. Okay, so then, uh... then chemo. It's spread. It's everywhere. Dying's expensive. Insurance covers shit. I'm sure as hell not gonna leave my wife and kid homeless and destitute, that's a fuckin' guarantee. Yesterday in the bar, when Frank was talking about preferring to die in the line of duty 'cause it would pump up his life insurance and benefit his kids, it made sense. It made a lot of sense. I'm gonna go down the street. What? Listen, I'm gonna need your help. He's dying. I'm dying. If I can get Señor to take me out in the line of duty, my family get a million bucks. What the fuck? What are you talking about, man? And you... you want my help with that? No, fuck that. He's an informant. Only you know he's an informant. Only you. This is fucking... this is crazy. Do you hear what you're asking me to do? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah, well, the answer's no. - Fuck, no. - It's for my family. You know what? Fuck you, Tommy. Yo, I ain't got no business with you, bro. Fuck. I ain't your bro, man. I see you talking to Five-O over there. Shit. Five-O just run up on me. I-- I ain't got shit. I know you've seen it. What I seen was they ain't searched your ass. Matter of fact, I think that they hit you off. Fucking snitch! Clock's ticking now, bro. - Is it good? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, good. - Delicious as usual. - Yay. - I gotta split. Mm. Have a good day. I love you. I love you too. Okay. See you, buddy. That's the proposal for you. Uh, yeah, I'm down. Um... You, uh, you remember that money house I-- I told y'all about? We do that money house, send-- send that dough to San Juan, and, um, yeah, we got a deal. Are you sure he's alone up there? Yeah, man. Oh, and, and he knows where your boy Chayo is at. Just give us the address. Moran was dying. For most guys, that would mean collapsing in a puddle of tears and whining. But in Moran's case, it just made him crazy brave. We had a lead on a money house that might bring us one step closer to taking down the cop killer. We had to go for it. Moran wasn't taking no for an answer. They're awake. Yeah, well, it ain't like he's gotta get up for work in the morning. Policía! Where's Chayo? They're going through the fucking fire escape! Fuck! Perseverance keeps honor bright. So, what do you got? Two male whites with ski masks crashed the victim's door. They know exactly where the money is. They didn't kill anyone. You figured they were cops, yeah? They spoke bad Spanish, but I'd say it's possible. Drug dealers rip each other off all the time. And it's easy to get a police jacket in any uniform store in Midtown. Don't drool over this one just yet. Belief's a graveyard. Oh, Bureau called. They have that police-involved shooting coverage on next week. Boy, I'm looking forward to that. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You need some blood in your alcohol stream. Here. Eat this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Am I supposed to eat this with my hands or what? The wife's worried about your drinking and your health. The irony. Maybe you should give it a rest or give re-- Give rehab another shot. Come on, man. I'm fine. You're not fine. I didn't save your life so you could fuck it up again. Look, I got, uh... I got 12K... in savings. I know it's not a lot, but it's yours. I appreciate it. I do. I can't do this... without you. It's not over till it's over. - Mike. - See you later. Whoa. Two drug dealers got ripped off by two guys posing as cops? Yeah. So be prepared for IAB snooping around. Does your CI have anything on Chayo? No. He's gone away for a week. I don't know where the fucker's gone. Gone away? Yeah, gone away. To the fucking Bahamas. He's at an all-inclusive shooting gallery. I know where his bodegais at. We can maybe do an OP, see if we can grab somebody. Good. Do that. You got rid of the jacket and the mask? Yeah. What are we gonna do about the money? Mail it to him, like he said. Do you really still wanna go through with this? Yes. Tom was asking me to put my neck in a noose. But how could I turn him down? He saved my fucking life. Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. When everything's wrong, that's when life sucks. Get in! Now! I heard about Cotto. Your info was bad. You didn't tell us there'd be another fucking guy in the place. I heard his stash is gone, though. It's taken care of. I bet. Get out. Shouldn't you just take it in? Mm-hmm. And how am I gonna pay for it, my charm? Yeah, and your good looks. Funny. Hm. Hey, what'd the doctor say? Didn't you see him? Waiting for results. Look, I'm fine. It's all-- it's all good. I wouldn't worry. I always worry. I know you do. You gotta stop anyway. I got a moonlight security gig tonight, so, uh... So I'll see you tomorrow. Yes, you will. Okay. Sorry, Mike, they're gonna cut you off. Hey. It was just going too far with Ginger. The alcohol and the drugs might kill me before the cancer would kill Tom. Shit was about to hit the fan. Look, uh... You know what? I-- I've been backing off. I'm trying to put myself in your shoes. And I'm not sure I could do what you're doing right now, But this ain't no bargain for me, okay? I've been having nightmares. And they're about to get a whole lot worse after tonight. And then I'm the one who has to face Anna and Mark. What-- what if somebody finds out that your shooter is our CI, huh? What then? My head will be spinning so bad from the Q&A from the DA's office and IAB. Right? But I won't have time to think about that because I'll be too busy working the Chayo caper and planning your funeral. That is, until they put my ass on ice for 25 to life. So don't act like this is some fucking picnic for me. Because it's starting to look a lot like you got the easy way out by dying. You know what? Truth is... when I'm alone... it does make some sense. Having something to die for is better than having nothing to live for. Right on time. Here. Give this to Mark. Oh, fuck. Uh... Fuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck, man. Jesus fucking Christ, you're fried. Man... Look, man, I-- I don't think I can do this, bro. Fuck-- What the fuck is wrong with you? Hey-- hey, listen. I-- I don't think I can do this shit, man. You fucking better do it. - Chill, man. I just-- - Fuck you, man. - You faggot! - I don't think I can fucking do this! Fuck. Stop. Fuck! - Policía. - Oh, shit. Show me your hands. Mikey! - Hey. - Man, you-- look, look, look-- I-- What the fuck are you doing, man? No, he just fucking put his gun-- - Drop the gun! What the... - Fuck! - Mike. Shit! - Drop the gun! Hey, Mikey look-- - Hey, hey, hey, drop it. - I'm sorry, man. Fuck. Alright. Fuck Tommy. Fucking, Tommy. Fuck. Finally, he, uh... came around, shooting. We exchanged... That's good for now. The DA will follow up, then the grand jury. I don't know. It all seems pretty cut and dry to me. Just a few routine questions. Why were you out there again? We're working a large sale case. - For a suspected sale? - No, but it's a drug-prone location. - For sales? - No, for users. We're looking for intel. You know, you catch a guy using, he gives you a name, you throw back the little fish. - So you let him go? - I did years in narcotics. That's how it's done. Move on. Did you identify yourselves as police? Yeah. We were doing a car stop. We said "police." We had the light on. Yes, but you were in plainclothes. I yelled "police" twice. Before or after the shooting? What the fuck? Lieutenant, there is no doubt that he knew we were cops. - Obviously. Learner, let's-- - I even yelled it in Spanish. ¿¿Hablas español? Yeah, just basic street stuff, you know? "Put up your hands. Where do you live?" We both do. Did. That's all for now, Mike. We'll be in touch. Scram. What the hell's the matter with you? They're standard questions. The guy just lost his partner. Exercise a little discretion. Ginger, the alcohol, the drugs... Nothing makes sense anymore. It was a beautiful service. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Mrs. Moran? - Yes. Kevin Hickey. Did you work with Thomas? I knew him. Yeah. You have my sincerest sympathies. Tom was a brave man. A very decent man. Sadly, sometimes loss shows us true value. I didn't need to lose him to know his value. Yeah, I'm sorry. I, uh... I don't quite know what to say at these things. I'm sorry for you and for your son. The whole department's behind you. Thank you. - Mrs. Moran. - Yes. I'm Joe Mangano. I'm your police union delegate. I imagine you're concerned about the expenses piling up. Oh, we... we have no money. I mean, his 20,000-dollar life insurance paid, but that doesn't cover the back payment on his mortgage and PSOBs not coming in for a year. We, we, we-- We can't cover this. I understand. Believe me, I get it. And I want you to know that we're going to cover everything. It's the least we can do for your husband's sacrifice. If it's all right, I would love the opportunity to explain the next steps. May I walk you out? Okay. Thank you. - Gary. - Mike. Well... recovery is rarely a straight line, brother. Every day is a new day. Have a seat. All right. We are a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help each other to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership here is a desire to stop drinking. It's Tom. Leave your number. What time tonight? Give me a call. Ask him if any of these voices sound familiar. It's Tom. Leave your number. What time tonight? Give me a call. He says maybe the first one, but he's not too sure. All right. Tell him to listen again. I don't think he wants to get involved, man. Tell him I don't care where he got the money from. He's a fucking drug dealer. - Tell him. - Look... I have to be here. You volunteered for this shit. Yeah, big boy. But what if these are dirty cops? He said he doesn't know. Look, you're on your own crusade, white knight. I'm done. Hey, Mike, got a minute? Um... I'm not gonna make a whole big how-to-do about it, 'cause I'm sure you wanna move on with things, um, but just... we-- we want you to know that we're glad you're back. So, uh, just to... ...bring you up to speed, um, I ran the perp from your shooting, um, to see if there was a connection. Jenny asked you to run him? No, I mean, he was a user, and your shooting wasn't far from the bodega, so I thought maybe, but that really doesn't matter, because it was a dead end, so he's out. We did get some surveillance photos, and we're hoping that Chayo's one of them. And, uh, we're gonna try a buy attempt in the hallway that Jimmy O's trying to set up. And we'll see what happens from there. What's up? I have a couple of old complaints on you and your partner. Now, I don't wanna bring you down officially in light of what's happened. Thing is, I still need to address them. I don't know, maybe if I knew a few things off the record, we could squash this, huh? Is there something you wanna ask me? 'Cause just come right out and ask it. No disrespect, but, um, was your partner having financial problems? This is, uh... this is off the record? Of course. Oh, off the record. Go fuck yourself. And no disrespect. Of course. Anna, just relax. He talked more to you? It's, uh, it's a cop thing, you know? No one, uh, can understand you like another cop. Well... maybe you know more about him than I do. What are you getting at? Was Tommy taking money on the side? Never. No. If he was, Mike, I have a right to know. Anna, think about it. If-- if he was taking money, don't you think you and Mark would have everything you needed and wanted? - Yeah. - What about that shit box he was driving, held together with bubble gum and rubber bands, huh? And where's this coming from? I don't know. Someone just came around and they were asking questions. The IA guy? - Learner? - Yeah. Look. There were these drug dealers. They lied. They said we ripped them off. That's it. I just buried my husband. Do I deserve a little peace? Yes. Yes. You do, and you will have it. And that guy, he won't mess with you again. I promise you that. Thank you. Take a look at the yellow and tell me what you make of that shit. Hey, you wanna play games? Okay, you play with me. You leave Moran's family out of it, understand? God, it is dangerous to be you in this world right now, Learner. Seems pretty upset for a guy who's done nothing wrong. Yeah, I wouldn't push the envelope. He's got the personality of a landmine right now. We've been told. Hey, why is Tom's locker empty right now? Take it easy. Learner took it. He's playing his game. When he doesn't find shit, he'll bring it back. Moving on. We're gonna try to make a buy attempt in that lobby to try to get a pipeline into Chayo. I need you on point. So I'm asking you... Yeah, I'm good, boss. - I'm good. - Okay. I'm thinking Moran and Thornton might be good for impersonation robbery. Because? They're narcotics. They know the players. Moran was buried in bills and expenses. His house was in foreclosure. - And? - It's motive. Hell, if that's a motive, I'm a suspect. They both spoke broken Spanish. The victim, to the perp's Spanish, was white boy-like. I re-interviewed them, they said he could be Moran and Thornton. Everybody speaks broken-- Hey, wait a minute. You're saying the victim somehow heard Moran and-- and Thornton speak, and since then they made some kind of voice comparison? How'd you manage that? I'm resourceful. That's a stretch. That's a lot of what-ifs, Learner. Don't open up a can of worms on the say-so of a drug dealer, okay? If I know anything about that pair, they can keep a secret. They've been joined at the hip since Desert Storm, and one of them ain't talking at all. See, what you got here is a tinderbox. You got a dead cop, a hero partner, and a widow. If you're wrong about this, that jarhead is gonna stick his foot so far up your ass, and there'll probably be a line behind him. All right. Well, the next thing I plan is-- Close-- close the door. No, don't. You'll be on the other side of the door when you close it. Got it. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. No, no, no. There goes Five-O. I told you it's gonna be fucking hot out here. I ain't doing no sale in the streets. All right, let's do this quick, then. Without a doubt, son. You know? 10-4. 2-5-5. Lobby out. What's fucking Learner doing here in his black cop car? It's a rip-off, move in, move in. 2-5, that's your radio. You're breaking up. Get down there, 2-5-5. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Papi, what's with the biscuit, man? Yo. Yo, can you help me out? - Fuckin' bum! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Give me your hand. - Don't fucking move! - Give me your hand. - Don't you fucking move! - Turn around! - I got him, I got him, I got him. - Come on. - Hey. Everybody okay? - Yeah, boss. We're good. - Yeah. What in the fuck were you thinking? Huh? Another cop almost got killed. You had no business tailing them on a buy. And here's another question for you, Detective. It's a police operation. Cops are involved. Shots are fired. And you don't even bother to get out of your car to see if they're okay? - I fucked up. - You bet you fucked up. You're not to follow them anymore. You got that? If I can't follow him, I'm gonna need to get into the confidential informant files. Well, that's fairly impossible. What the fuck for? These two cops have more CIs than anyone on their team. The perps from this robbery knew exactly where the money was hidden. Now, I have a feeling that they're either using CI information or that the shooter is either-- All you got is conjecture, all right? My gut is right on this, sir. Why are you defensive of him? Why do you keep shutting me out? Ah, you hold your horses, pal. You watch those accusations. I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna interview Thornton. You're gonna close this thing up, okay? Just your basic fucking police work. - Is this police work? - Yeah. Turning a deaf ear to your subordinate when he's telling you that he may have legit corruption. Closing a blind eye to the evidence he presents you. Learner, you're about an inch away from getting bounced out of the IAB, and that's pretty tough to do. But you're also a cunt hair away from getting your ass kicked. Why do you want him so bad? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. - I'm just doing my job. - No, no. You've had a hard-on for him from the start. Now, why is that? They don't follow the rules, sir. They do whatever the hell they want. Guys like that, they give the department a bad name. Guys like that made this department what it is today. Yeah. Have a seat, gentlemen. - Mike. - Lieutenant. Hickey. How are you? Well, sit down. Yeah. All right, oh, where's that damn tape? Oh, here it is. Okay. Here we go. Now... I'm sure we have got better things to do, so let's just jump right into this. - Everybody ready? - Yeah. Okay. Uh... Have you ever loaned your partner a large sum of money? Uh, what's a large sum? A thousand bucks? I see he was in quite the financial bind. - Is that a question? - It's a fact. Detective Moran's financial status has no bearing on allegations against Detective Thornton. Do you know how much we make? Learner, can we get to the point? Did you or your partner ever meet a CI outside of the job? No. Never. Outside of drug houses, has a CI ever informed you about money spots? That's not enough for an arrest or a search warrant, so what good is that info to us? - That's what I'd like to know. - All right, that's enough. Hickey, if this keeps up, we're filing a grievance to the accusatory tone of your investigator. I mean, you're not investigating allegations. You're making accusations. Duly noted. Move on. Have you seen Mrs. Moran since the shooting? What the fuck does that have to do with anything, huh? If your all so close, and I know you spend nights over there on occasions. Ah, Learner, where do you get the balls for this? Come on, can we move on? Can you explain this? I make it to be a ski mask. I found that in your partner's locker. Says you. It was obtained during an ongoing internal affairs investigation. Then why isn't it vouchered? Excuse me? Well, it should be in a property envelope with a voucher attached marked as investigatory evidence in order to, you know, ensure the chain of evidence. I mean, you could have bought that on the way over here. Okay, I'm wrapping this up. That's enough of that. All right. It's okay. He's just playing at being a cop 'cause he's never actually been one. I got nothing to hide, so... You got nothing to hide? Then let me ask you something, - off the record, of course. - Sure. But remember, last time. You still fucking your dead partner's wife? - Okay. Mike! - Mike. - I fucking warned you! - Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. Go on. Go on. Fuck him. - Did you hear what he said? - I don't give a rat's ass. This is still an investigation and you never raise your hands, right? Hickey. Asshole. What the fuck was that? I wanted to send him over the edge, make him come clean. Come clean about what? I know he's dirty. You've jeopardized other cops' lives. They're definitely gonna file a grievance against us. You jackpotted your own career, and worst of all, I'm gonna get one up the ass. This investigation is over. I'm keeping the tape. Are you gonna let this assault go? Buddy, for a minute, I almost helped him. Kid from the hallway gave up what might be Chayo's main digs. Catching Chayo was Moran's last wish. Talk to me, Harnischer. What's going on? I don't see the fucker. No sign of our subject? Be advised, Leader, no sign of our subject as of yet. 10-4. Keep an eye on him. Tell him to keep watching. He's gonna fall asleep. Detective Cruz. Detective Cruz. - What can I do for you? - I need some information pertaining to a registered informant. I think you might have something I need. Where the fuck is he? 10-4. Keep an eye on him. Ohh... I think our man just showed up. Be advised, subject just arrived. Yeah. There you are. Okay, subject at location now. Nice. He's got him. I need this information, por favor. You need a request from your CO stating why. Hold on. And if a judge approves it, I will notify you. Those files are very sensitive. You live in Queens, right? What's this about? Your auto insurance here says that you live in, uh... New Jersey. Heh. Wasn't that something? Close enough to commute to the city, yet far enough away for a drop in your insurance premium. Wow. Excuse me? In this crazy city, you have nothing better to do than mess with me. Which way would those files be? - Gracias. - Mm. Who's the guy? Gotcha. Gracias. Talk to me, Harnischer. What's going on? - What's going on? - Shh, shh. You hear that shit? Is there a back door to this building? You're gonna have to repeat later. There's a motorcycle buzzing around. Take a plate on that motorcycle. - What's this fucking guy doing? - What the fuck? Talk to me, Harnischer! Kurt? Oh, fuck! 10-13, Central. 10-13. Shots fired. 357-1457 Street. You know the policy on vehicle pursuits? We shouldn't have even been out there in the first place. We're so undermanned. Well, then why were you? - Your guy is very fortunate. - Fortunate? He's in critical but stable condition. What's that mean, Doc? It means he got shot in the liver. Lost a lot of blood. Doesn't look very lethal, but that could change. - Did you recover the bullet? - You kidding? A lot of blood in there. We were packing the liver. I mean, if we saw it, we could have grabbed it. What, is it still in there? Yeah, I mean, the area where he got shot, the bullet's caught between three blood vessels. We call it the Bermuda Triangle. Unless he got a clear shot, we wouldn't go after it. Is he gonna be okay with that? Sure, unless you're worried about lead poisoning. Usually, going after a bullet is more trouble than it's worth. - Trust me. - Oh, we don't need the evidence. We know who shot him. Later on, when he wakes up, you can send your team in to see him. I wouldn't let that motherfucker nab me with a scalpel. Here he comes. Don't give him anything. Mike, I have to place you on suspension. We should wait for Mike's delegate. Doesn't matter at this point. What are the charges? Fraternizing with confidential informants outside of departmental guidelines, for starters. I need your gun and your shield. I'd rather give them to a real cop than an empty suit. Mike, watch yourself. Be advised, Sergeant Sullivan, once these two are found guilty of wrongdoing, charges will be brought against you for failure to supervise. Back the fuck off. It's over, Mike. It's Detective Thornton, you fucking prick. Not anymore. I've seen your records. You guys did some... Huh. Good work. A thankless job. But... somewhere along the line, things went sideways. This won't go away. It's gonna haunt you and the Moran family. You don't know shit about the Moran family. It's your last chance, Michael. Last chance at what? Redemption. What happened that night? I told you what happened that night. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Tell me again. - A hero fell. Look, I know you don't wanna destroy his legacy, but it's better this thing comes out right, - the way you want it told. - No. Come clean, Mike. Huh? Be honest. It's gonna come out anyway, one way or the other. Take a shot at freedom while you still have it. Why did Señor kill Moran? He's a fucking junkie. I don't know. He was your junkie. - What did he have on you guys? - He was high. - Why were you out there? - He was suicidal. I don't fucking know. - Suicidal? - What? Yeah. What were you doing out there? Nothing. I told you already. Why did your CI want him dead? - I don't know. - You don't know? They're both dead. Why did he kill him? They were both already dead. All right? Señor was dying of AIDS. He was suicidal. He was leaving a wife and kid destitute. And Moran, he found out he had cancer. He had weeks to live. We robbed that dealer to send the money back to Señor's family. At least, maybe they would have a chance. And we staged the shooting so Moran's family would get the full death benefits. You know, Señor, he was supposed to kill himself. But, uh... ...he got scared. He couldn't do it, so he started shooting at me. It's got a happy ending, you know, 'cause they're dead and their families are taken care of. Are you happy now? You wanna shame a hero cop who knew he was dying, who sacrificed his last days on this earth with his family so he doesn't leave them in a mess. You have at it, Learner. You couldn't shine his fucking shoes. Congratulations, Learner. You cracked your first case. Thank you, Lieutenant Hickey. Learned a lot from you, sir. Hm. You knew, didn't you? Knew what? You knew. That's why you kept trying to deter me. Yeah, I lost a partner on the job once, you know? Over the years, I stayed in touch with his kids, and... they're doing well. They're happy. Seventeen years. We took care of him. Yeah. If I was in Mike's shoes, I might have done the same thing he did. And slept well. It's our job... to protect the community, uphold the law. They broke the rules, sir. Rules. There's no rules. These guys put their lives on the line every single day hunting down assholes. We sleep good at night because these guys deal with the ugly shit, so we don't have to. That's why the rules matter. There's no room for error. An error means a funeral. That's right, it's life or death. Strap on a bulletproof vest for what? Shitty paycheck, the alcoholism, the nightmares. If you're lucky, that means you're still alive. America without cops would be like-- like God without his angels. It's not for everyone, sir. Damn right it's not. You're so focused on the manual that you're willing to tear down someone who's spent the last 12 years keeping the wolves at bay. I'm not trying to tear anyone down. I'm after the truth. The truth is that sometimes the department doesn't protect your family after you've spent your whole life protecting everybody else's. I call Detective William Learner of the Internal Affairs Bureau to state the charges and specifications against Detective Michael Thornton. I must inform the board at this time the parties of the Internal Affairs Bureau concerned with allegations of misconduct against Detectives Michael Thornton and Thomas Moran wish to withdraw departmental and criminal charges. Was this a self-initiated case? I apologized to the board for misleading you. I acted hastily. To pursue these charges would be a disregard for the facts. And what are the facts? My suspicion was based on a now proven false allegation and supported by an unfortunate string of coincidences. I request that even my filing on these charges be expunged from the record so to not blemish these detectives' untarnished records. Um... Effective immediately, your suspension is rescinded. You may resume your assignment. Yeah, club soda with lime. Well, club soda. I'll take yours then. You won't be needing this. - A toast. - Cheers. - To Chayo getting nine. - Salud. - Yes, yes, yes. - We got it, we got it. - Hear, hear. - Long time coming. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Yeah. - We got them. Salud. I was just passing by the bar to see how you were doing. Yeah, I'm good. Hey, where's your guy? Believe it or not, he transferred out and into narcotics in Brooklyn. Well, I did not see that coming. No, me either. He's a Boy Scout, but, you know, he'll be all right. Is that Vietnam? Oh, yeah. Yeah, two tours. You know, war's like surviving a tornado. Well, you know that. Moran knew that. Once the storm is over, you don't even remember how you survived it. Hmm. It's never really over, is it? No. One thing's for sure. You don't come out the same way you went in. See, you were born 20 years too late for the job. They don't want guys like you and Moran anymore. A long time ago, long before they even invented light bulbs, some smart-ass named Machiavelli, I think he said, um, "It's better to be loved than--" No, "it's better to be feared than loved." I mean, what's that say about us, huh? That we're a bunch of fucking animals? Mm. But we're also the zookeepers. Is that love? Is that your dad's baseball mitt? It's not a mitt, it's a glove. I stand corrected. Spoken like the son of a real baseball player.
