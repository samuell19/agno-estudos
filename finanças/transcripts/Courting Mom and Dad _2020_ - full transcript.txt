Hurry up! Everyone's on! Why can't I hear them? You have it on mute. Oh, yeah! Oops. - Hey, guys! - Hi! - Hi! - Hey, guys! Hi! Hi! Sorry, technical difficulties. - Yes, I have a question. - How much does it cost? One at a time. We can't hear you. I've got some college money saved up. - It's not that simple. - Excuse me. Where do we even start? Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes. You, sir. I don't have any money, but if you make my mom and daddy love each other, I'll give you this. Aw! That's very sweet of you, but we're not here to take your money or your teddy bear. We're here to create a safe place to share stories and support one another. Oh, okay, I get it now. Will you tell us your story? Oh, yeah, that's a great idea. Okay, but it's a really, really long story. Looks like we have some time. Uncle Paul's still sleeping. So, where should we start? Ooh, ooh! Remember Dad in that funny robe? No. We should start when we were behind the bushes. Guys, the story's not about all the crazy things we did. But it was really fun stuff. Yeah. Our story's about faith, hope and love and how adults need to be reminded what they had and what's still there. Let's go back, way back. It was 1998. Wait, wait. Didn't they have color TVs back then? Oh, yeah. You're right. Not that far back. Let me know if you need anything, okay? Dad was working his usual shift at the local Italian restaurant. He was the best waiter. He knew everybody's name. It was just another Friday night until he met her. Oh! Hey. For the first time in his life, he was speechless. - Sorry. - Yeah. My bad. And that's unusual for Dad. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Sorry. Can I take this table? - Yeah. - Okay, thank you. Hey, ladies. Welcome to Tony's Bella Vista. My name is Brent, and I will be taking care of you. Mom said she had a little crush on Dad right away. I mean I'll be serving you. He was pretty funny too. Here, do you know what you'd like to order? They both knew something special was happening that night. Bye. Mom could feel it. I'm pretty sure that's why she stuck around for a little while. Uh, save me a bite? Yeah? Okay, cool. They talked and laughed all night. Mom had a smile that could light up a room. Dad even got a little mushy and drew a picture for her. It truly was love at first sight. They got married right away. Bought a new house. And we started showing up one by one. Yeah, that's me in the belly. That's me as a baby. Aren't I so cute? They were so happy. We were so happy. But time changes everything. Izzy! Go get the bread. Oh, my gosh! Are you guys done yet? Do you have the drinks? Or the napkins? We got this, sis. What am I forgetting? Oh, yeah! Sauce. So pretty! It's all in the details. Wait, you gotta get the waters. We have to hurry. Mom's gonna be here any minute. Is Dad gonna show this time? Yes. - I hope this works out. - Stop worrying. It will. Izzy! You got sauce all over the plates! Oh, brother! It doesn't have to be perfect. Said it once, I've said it a million times. - It's all in the... - Details. Aw. It's perfect, Ruby. They'll love it. Mom's here. Andrew, did you set up the monitor? I forgot. Daddy! Ruby, go stand by the door, but don't let Dad in until I tell you to. Andrew, move it! We need some serious intel tonight. Right on it. Wow. What smells so good? - Hi, Mom. - Hey! - You're here early. - You cooked dinner? Yes. I threw together my famous lasagna. You are so amazing, sweetheart. Oh, you take such good care of us. It's the least I could do. I know that you have a lot on your mind. I wonder who that can be. I'll go get it. Okay. Okay! Open the door. - Hi, Daddy! - Hey. Surprise! What? What? Yeah, what? Uh, what are you guys up to? We thought it'd be nice for all of us to have dinner together. Like a family. Well, that would be up to your mom. Yes, of course. I mean, we're still a family. Great! Let's eat. Izzy, great job with dinner. Thanks, Dad. You want more? No. No, I'm full. Thank you, sweetheart. When's your first baseball game? Don't know. Thinking about quitting the team. That's a pretty rose. Ruby did that. Details, Mom. I remember when your father remembered those details. Who wants dessert? - I do! - I do! Who has dessert on the porch? It was an awkward moment. I just panicked. Come on, guys. Listen to the monitor. Shh, listen. The kids seem all right. Seriously? Can't you see how hard this has been on them? Look at all this trouble that they went to just for us to have a family dinner together. Yeah, and we just had a very nice family dinner together. What did he say? Shh, shh, shh. I can't hear. Nothing seemed odd. It didn't seem odd? Are you kidding? They've just been acting so strange lately. I just think that they know. Yeah, of course they know. What? Did you say something? What do we know? This isn't going well. Brent? No. What? Did you say something to the kids about us? No! Of course not. I don't know where your head is right now, but you're definitely not present. I'm sorry. It's... It's the office. I gotta get back to my place. You know what? We agreed that no matter what happens with our marriage, we would keep this family together. Sarah, I know that, and I'm sorry. Okay? Chelsea called an emergency meeting for tomorrow, and there's a lot riding on this Allied deal. You promised the kids that you would take them to the movie tomorrow. I know that. And I'll do my best to get here by noon. Do you even know what your best is? Nice. What do we know? What don't we know? We know in one week, Mom and Dad will have been separated for a year. Maybe they are getting a divorce. Andrew, stop! We don't know that for sure. Let's just have faith, and everything will work out. Mommies and daddies should stay together. Yeah. We've got nothing to worry about. Come on, guys. How many times do we have to go over this? It's obvious. We've had radio silence from Allied for the past two weeks, which can only mean one thing. Calloway? Um, it's not good? Wrong answer! It means someone else is courting Harlan. I need you to find out who is trying to steal this deal from us! Right. Right, right, right. Find out who's the other company. Okay. All right, let's go. I'm going to take you to the movies. But I thought Dad was taking us. Come on! Let's go. You're gonna miss the previews. Right, right. Find out who's the other company. I'm on it. We're on it. Brent's on it. Right, Brent? On it. Yes. Would you like a more quiet place to text, Lambert? Oh. Yeah, sorry about that, Chelsea. We're about to lose $13 million in commission. Sorry just isn't good enough. Find out who is playing in our sandbox and squash them. Absolutely. We will get it done. I mean, what's up with all the texts, man? You was leaving me hanging here. - Come on, guy. - I'm sorry about that, Cal. It's Sarah. I think we're done. I'm sorry, man. You guys been separated for, what, like a year? Yep. It's kind of a long time, man. Can't say you didn't try. You tried, right? I think so. My turn! Ooh! - Ooh! - Nice! Sorry about today. Yeah, I know. It's always something. So, we go to court in a couple of days? Yeah. I guess this is it, then. I guess. I didn't want this. I don't think you know what you want, Brent. Oh, okay, all right. I get it. It's all my fault. I own it. That's not what I said. It's just your priorities aren't in order, that's for sure. Maybe we should just do what I came here to do. Okay, you go. - Oh! - Oh! Oh, my God! Can you stop playing for a second? Your mom and I have something that we... we need to tell you. Sometimes, for parents to... Be better parents... - they need to... - Get a divorce. Andrew. Isn't that what you're about to say? Yes. But we want you to know that we are still gonna be a family, okay? Yeah, and that we love you very much. And we love you too. But your divorce has a direct impact on our personal and emotional well-being, so we can't allow this to happen. We'll discuss our next course of action and get back to you. Thank you. What she said. Ditto. What do you mean, "We'll discuss our next course of action"? I mean, we're not gonna let this happen. Oh, boy. You got that crazy look in your eye. What are we gonna do? Look, I still believe Mom and Dad love each other. So, we need to take matters into our own hands. And I know the perfect person who can help. Come on, let's go! - I think it's this way. - Yeah. - Remember to look for cars! - Yeah. Guys, wait up! Come on, Ruby. It's so far up the hill. Come on, guys! Cross your fingers. Hi, Uncle Paul! Oh. Hey, guys! Whoa. What happened to you? Oh, it was nothing. I was just cutting a tree down the other day, and I fell. Down that hill? Yeah. Yeah, down that hill. But it's okay. I landed on my feet. Ow! Looks like he landed on his face. Oh! You know, Uncle Paul, maybe you need help around here. No. It's nothing a little ice won't take care of. - Maybe you should sit down for a minute. - Oh! Ruby, go get an ice pack for Uncle Paul. - Good idea. - Come on. Okay. Let's go. All right. Ooh. Ah. Ow. Okay, whew. Look, I know you guys didn't come all the way over here to take care of this old fella, so I can tell something's bothering you. Well, it's kind of a long story. Our parents are getting a divorce, and we need your help. Well, that pretty much sums it up. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, guys. Really, I am. Look, I know you're a little young to understand this, but relationships are complicated. Your parents have been dealing with this for a while, and there's only so much I can do. They need to be willing to do the work. Clearly they're not working hard enough. Well. Here you go! Oh. Goodness. Let's move this down to my feet, and I got something for you. Uncle Paul, focus. We need serious help. Well, patience, child. Okay. Can we pray or something? Isn't that what pastors do? I can pray, you can pray, and your parents can pray. Okay, which one? That one for you, and that for you. And so what we're gonna do, take this string, and you're gonna hold it really tight. Hold it tight, hold it tight. And you're going to pull and just like that. Not very strong. Right? And then we go to the purple one. Watch the purple one. Watch. There's a little string right here, and you're gonna hold this really tight. Yep, yep. Really tight. So beautiful. Oh, my goodness. Look. And then we're gonna twist it together with this green one, and you're gonna hold it tight, and look, it's a little stronger. Pull, pull, pull. You can't get it. Oh, my goodness, that was strong. Wasn't it? But it still comes undone. And now, let's go to the gold one. And when we take three strings, we're gonna twist that together, and it all of a sudden becomes a lot stronger. And so that's what happens when you put God in the center of a marriage. It becomes that much stronger. That's what'll happen if our parents pray? It's a start. But they're going to court in two days. Listen, I think what your parents need is time. And I've got a buddy that owes me a favor, and I think that he can help give your parents the time that they need. Is this person a pastor like you? Well, not exactly. Hi! I'm Donovan Marshall. Call me now! There's a new marshal in town, and he's collecting. Don't be shortchanged! Pew! You have outdone yourself. Seriously, this is a game changer! I love the line, "There's a new marshal in town!" Pew, pew, pew! Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, put it all over social media. We can't afford that! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, you know, Facebook, Tweeter, Instacart. Instagram! He knows what I'm talking about! You know what I'm talking about, right? Okay, great! This is awesome. Seriously. Move over, Spielberg. All right. Talk to you later. Come on! This is the place. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I'm so excited, but I hope everything goes well. Come on. Come on, Ruby. We can't afford those commercials. We can't even afford this office. We were perfectly fine in my father's garage. You're not thinking big enough. This is gonna get my name out there. They're gonna come knocking at my door! Wow. That was fast. ♪ There's a new marshal In town ♪ ♪ Collecting for you ♪ Mark my word! You're gonna be broke so soon, and we will be back in my padre's casa! Shh! Hi! Are you Donovan Marshall? - Yes! - Great! A good friend sent us. Wait. Oh, boy. Aw! You guys are so cute! Aw! Can I get you anything to drink? - Yes, please! - Oh, well, that's not necessary. They're not staying very much longer. Professional. What are you doing? Okay, kids. I'm afraid I don't have any lollipops. We're not here for candy. We need a lawyer. Look, I'm a personal injury attorney. I work with people who've actually been injured somehow, so... But we have been injured! And hurt! Yes! Now we're talking. I mean, how unfortunate. Our parents are getting a divorce. It's gonna mess everything up. It hurts our feelings. I'm not following here. Sorry. - You're a lawyer, right? - Yes. We want you to sue them or something. Make it so they can't get a divorce, or at least not right away. They need time. Time for what? For our parents to figure it out. So they can start praying for each other. Oh! You want me to intervene in an ongoing court proceedings and file an injunction, thus delaying your parents' divorce. Yes! Can you do it? Not a chance. But why? One, I don't do divorces. Two, what you're asking will probably get me disbarred. And three, most important, no one in this scenario has any money. - No! No, please. - Really, no, please. - No. - My watch is worth a pretty penny. No, it's not, really. - Out. Let's go, let's go. - Thanks for nothing! - Come on, Ruby. - Ooh, okay! And thank you too! All right. Ah, that's a feisty little one. - Oh, excuse me. - Mm-mmm. - All right. I gotta... - Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. - What are you doing? - You owe our friend a visit. Go. Just go. Go, go, go. - Do I have to? - Yes, you do. Go. This will be good for you! Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a neat trick you pulled today. Hey, Donovan, old buddy, old pal. Long time, no see. Don't "old buddy, old pal" me, okay? You're meddling again, and I'm not biting. I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You know, you can use zip ties to hang this, right? I think duct tape works just the same. Clearly. Look, this is a chance for you to help the helpless. I mean, don't you already say that in your commercials? Yeah, I already do that. Okay? "I've collected millions on their behalf." I bet you have. I know. This is different. Well, you met the kids. You see how the idea of divorce affects them. You're still trying to save the world. Nah, just my family. So what do you need me for? If you want to help them, why don't you just help them? It's not that easy. My sister is not so inclined to get help from her big brother. Look, come on. Help an old buddy, old pal out. Paul, have you ever heard of no fault? I mean, courts can't force people to stay married. Yeah, no fault is unilateral divorce. It's when one spouse acting alone forces the other into a divorce. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. No promises. I'll look into it. This'll be good for you. Why does everyone keep saying that? Uh, Paul, do you need any help here? No, I got it. It's not my first rodeo. Okeydoke. I'm gonna remind you again. You're entitled to considerably much more than you're asking for. Well, I just thought it was fair for the both of us. Fair? If fair's all you want, then why did you hire me? Who has Mr. Lambert retained? Well, I think my husband... Okay. Right there. Don't think of him as your husband ever again. From this day forward, he is the defendant. Okay. I think Brent, the defendant, hired an old college friend, Hayden Grimes. He was actually best man at our wedding. Grimes? That guy is... Evil. Claire Hudgens. That woman is black-hearted. I don't know what you did to Sarah, but if she hired Claire, it must have been pretty bad. Grimes. It's not like that at all. I mean, I think Sarah knows her from a book club or something. Women getting together and talking, it's bad news. It's bad news for men. You are funny, man. It's not like that. It's Sarah! We're, we're great. It's fine. I'm not overreacting. Listen, buddy, I've been doing this a long time, and I am telling you as a friend, you are gonna have to toughen up, or she's gonna eat you alive. - You know why divorces are so expensive? - No. Because they're worth it. - Huh? - Okay. Come on, bring it in! - All right. - Don't forget the check. Okay. What a friend! So what's gonna happen? Two houses, two bedrooms, two sets of clothes. One here, and one with Dad. I can't sleep. It's okay. None of us can. It's going to be fine. Everyone gets divorced these days. - Bianca! - What? Bianca! What? Got the most amazing idea. - You're getting us a coffeemaker? - No, I'm good. How much money do you think I spend on my television commercials? - Mmm... - Exactly! A ton. - But where's it get me? - Actually... Exactly. Nowhere. I'm sorry, I got lost in "amazing idea." Could you imagine the free publicity I'll get representing these kids? Call the newspapers. Call the radio station! I think you're missing the bigger picture here. You're right. Forget about the newspapers. Call the television stations! What about the clients? - Who? - The children. Yeah. Call them too. If Dale eats one half of a cookie, and Billy eats another half of a cookie, how many cookies are left? Easy! Two cookies. Uh, it's one cookie. Two halves make one whole. No, but it's not a real cookie, so it would just fall apart. You make a good point. Guys, you're not gonna believe this. Mr. Marshall's taking our case! - What does that mean? - We have a lawyer! Yeah! What do we do now? I guess we just leave it up to Mr. Marshall. Hey. Find anything yet? Yeah, I just found an article on precision agriculture, and it mentions Allied has patents for some of the top AG automation technologies. You're brilliant, my friend. Huh? What is this? "AG Tech Expo & Conference, featuring Chelsea Dwyer on the panel of Feeding the World... an event series focused on technologies transforming the global food system." Tech influencer? What does that even mean? I mean, this doesn't make any sense. She doesn't even know how to use a printer. She's a IT Mother Teresa. - What? - Yeah. What are you talking about? Do you really think that Chelsea's the head of some charity? Yeah. Do you know she feeds the homeless every weekend? She has a popular blog, "Vegan Tech Talk." - What? - Yeah. Really. Cal, are you stalking our boss? I'm just saying. Oh, no. I have to go, Cal. Listen, I hate doing this to you, but there's something not right here. You mind digging a little deeper for me? - Yeah. No problem, Brent. - Okay. - Saving jobs, saving lives. - All right. - Hey. - Go away. Are you going somewhere, Lambert? Um, I am. It's, um... It's personal. But I got some good news. I think we may have found something. I believe that the company may be an American tech company. - $13 million, Brent. - Yes, I know. It's... It's my family. We're your family, Brent. An extended family of 200 employees. Not to mention the shareholders who are gonna want to blame someone if this thing goes sour. Whatever that is, handle it and get your head back in the game. Yes, ma'am. I'm going to be back later. I'm into it 100%. All right? Whatever it takes. We may have a problem. I know, I know. I'm late. Sorry, sorry. Wow. Late for your own divorce hearing. That is one for the books. Oh, it's my boss. She's very demanding. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Your boss is a woman? - Yeah. - Ah. Say no more. Is he always this late? I mean, this could be an issue with alimony and child support. Well, he's usually on time, but lately, I don't know. You're still making excuses for him. Let me tell you something about men. Women are process-oriented. It's not about the destination. It's about the journey. Men are goal-oriented. For them, it's about completing the task, checking it off and moving on to the next thing. That's why they change so much during marriage. You were once a goal, and now, you've been checked off. All we want is to be done, to be finished, to have all the work behind us. But you're never done with a woman. She resets at midnight. You begin each day at zero, my friend. They're complacent and lazy. They need us to tell them what time to come home, whether their clothes match or not, or if they like broccoli. No matter how great a sacrifice, or what a wonderful husband you've been over the last 20 years, none of that matters now. You may think you have points from the past, but you would be a fool to think you've accumulated any. All rise! The honorable Judge Heavener presiding. Sit down. Both of you, front and center. I thought I made it clear when I said I never wanted to see the both of you together in my courtroom again. Yes, Judge. Imagine my shock when I discovered that Ms. Hudgens here had agreed to represent the plaintiff, - knowing very well... - Your Honor. Mrs. Lambert... Sarah and I are longtime acquaintances, and I can assure you that she retained my services long before Mr. Grimes. I was Brent's best man. Give me a break! Unless the defendant is capable of precognition. Enough! One outburst, one childish display, and I will find you both in contempt. Now, sit down. - In the matter of the marriage of Brent A. Lambert... - What's all that about? ...and Sarah C. Lambert, we come to the preliminary hearing before the state court. Are the parties and their attorneys prepared to proceed? - Yes, Judge. - Yes, Your Honor. Then by all means, please do. Your Honor, this is a case of a stay-at-home mom requesting the right to continue to do so. - The defendant... - I object! You can't object to an opening statement. I object to your tone. My tone is no more on trial than your mismatched shirt and tie. - So arrogant. - Quiet! - You so drive me crazy! - I'm arrogant? I will have order! Now, we are going to proceed in an orderly and professional manner as befits the respectful nature of what we're doing. Your honor, my name is Donovan Marshall, and I represent the children of the litigants. I request permission to be able to represent and sit in on these hearings. - My kids hired an attorney? - It's unlikely. It's clearly a tactic employed by opposing counsel. I don't understand. What do the kids have to do with this? Nothing. Children have no adversary interest in a divorce action. This is an obvious ploy to derail our proceedings. Would someone care to tell me what's going on here? Your Honor, as unlikely as it may seem, I can hardly agree that the children have no interest. Why, half this petition concerns itself with custody, visitation, child support and schooling. And as such, I believe children are entitled to representation. I've seen your commercials. - I know who you are. - Yes, Judge. I don't like you. It's understandable. And I won't let you join Moe and Curly over here and turn my courtroom into a three-ring circus. Noted. Your Honor, it may please you to know that I plan to navigate the litigants out of your courtroom and into family mediation. - Mediation? - Yes. You mean to say, if I let you sit in today, that the three of you will just disappear? Well, that's the plan. Okay. This court will consider you the guardian ad litem for the children of Brent and Sarah Lambert. And as such, you will be permitted to participate in these proceedings. But let me remind you, counsel, this courtroom is no place for cheap Hollywood theatrics. Well, of course, Your Honor. I have nothing but respect for the sanctity of this courtroom and the judiciary process. Is it true you're championing marriages by representing children in divorce cases? Well, you see, I collect... I fight for those who cannot defend themselves. Are you embarking on a crusade to preserve families? Well, I... Anything yet? No, maybe I'll just text Bianca. Hi! Your mother and I would like an explanation. We're not supposed to discuss the case. That's not gonna cut it, Izzy. Sit down. Your dad and I understand that you are having some difficulties with what we're going through. But what you guys did today, that's not the way you handle it. What do you mean? - What do I mean? - By hiring a lawyer! And going to court. That's not how families deal with their problems. Isn't that what you two are doing? Look, I didn't want to get a divorce. - But your mother says that she's unhappy. - What? - No, you're gonna blame me for this? - No, no. You're not gonna take any responsibility for this relationship? - I'm not blaming you. I'm just stating a fact. - But you just did. You can't just say that in front of our kids - and say that I'm the one that wanted a divorce. - I'm not blaming you. - Yes, you... - You said to me that you are unhappy. But we live like roommates. - That's why we're getting... - But did you or did you not tell me... Excuse me! We're still in the room! I'm sorry. That was wrong of us. I'm sorry. Look, you guys are just gonna have to trust us to make the right decisions. Always remember, we are on your side. "Remember we're on your side"? What does that even mean? Who put my socks in the underwear drawer? Guys! Mr. Marshall said Mom and Dad are going to do mediation. Meditation? No, mediation. It just means they can't get a divorce for now. Holy macaroni. - Then we did it! - We did it! - Yay! - Yay! Well, welcome back to Good Morning Carla. We have Mr. Donovan Marshall with us, and you've had quite a busy morning, haven't you? I certainly have, Meredith. - You know what... - Uh. Carla. But what would you say to your detractors who claim that what you're doing is nothing more than a self-serving publicity stunt? You know what, Meredith? Petty as it may be, jealousy is rampant in my profession. Let me tell ya. Although it is, and I understand that. I mean, what you do I could never do, uh, but this is a no-fault state, and children can't legally stop their parents from divorcing. What do you have to say about that? Well, you know I cannot discuss the details of my ongoing case, Savannah, but what I can say is this, the children... the children are my main priority. Well, thank you, Mr. Marshall. That's great. We'll be right back with Good Morning Carla. Yes! New marshal in town! Did I wear the right tie? Good morning. Hold a second, please. The phone has been ringing all morning. - That's awesome! - No, it's not. Because half the people calling still drink out of juice boxes. - Do you see that? - Hmm? Someone left that. It had a note that said, "There's more where that came from." My little buddy! This is serious. You're not listening to me, Mr. Marshall. It's not about kids. Their parents are calling too. Hmm. They're accusing you of giving their children false hope. Actually, the bar is considering to review your practice. - Ooh. - You don't even have a plan. Oh, Bianca, of course I have a plan. It's already in motion. This case will go away. They'll figure it all out in mediation. There's a new marshal in town, and he just saved the day. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! Ha! We're gonna be rich. - That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. - Sad's good. There's money in sad too. We don't want to be disturbed. Trust me, I've got this covered. Ah. Speak of the devil. Got to go. Sit down. I'm sorry about this morning. I'm going through some personal business. Your personal business is all over the news. It's not good for us, Brent, especially now that things are so fragile. It makes us look unstable. - Like we might not be up to the task. - Well, that was... That was unintentional. My, my kids have... Your private life is incidental. I need you to concentrate on what's important. Have you figured out who is dabbling in our pot? Well, I need a little bit more time, - but I think that it's... - It's Dolva Tech. Dolva Tech. Right. I... That was my hunch. - How did you... - Don't try to take credit for something that I figured out. But since I have my priorities straight, I'm about to make your day. Do you own a tuxedo? I think I do, somewhere. You and I will be attending a black tie charity benefit tonight. Harlan Hames will be there. 7:00 p.m. sharp. It is critical that you are not late. Well, that... It's a little short notice for me. Do you see what this says? Uh, "Pain is money. There is no profit in happiness." That's deep. My father taught me that. And he also taught me that winners never make excuses. Sounds like you had a magical childhood. Oh, you're very funny, Brent, but let's get one thing clear. This is your last opportunity to impress upon Harlan that we know what we're doing. It's all on you. I appreciate the second chance. It's your only chance. Harlan. How are you? Yes, we are on our way. 6:00 p.m. on the dot. Looking forward. Hey, how's the homework going? - Good. - Good. Uncle Paul says to tell you hello. What? When'd you talk to him, Ruby? You don't remember, Mom? We went to see Uncle Paul... Last week, for that thing. - Yeah! - What? No, remember when we went to his house? What? All right. Nobody move. I want to know what's going on. Hey. Paul. What a coincidence. We were just talking about you. - Why is he calling here? - I have no clue. I'll get it. - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Where's your mom? Kitchen. - Hey, guys. - Hi, Dad! Hey, Dad. Guys! Quickly. Uh-huh. - Hey. - Yeah. Where's my tuxedo? Hey. - Can it hold for one second? - Hold on. What are you doing? - My tuxedo. I need it. - One second. Thanks. Okay, bye. I... Do you know where my tux is? I need it. Your what? My tuxedo. Where is it? Look, Brent, that was my brother on the phone. And he wants to talk to us, something about the kids. I think it's in the garage. - Why isn't this thing working? - Maybe bad reception? Maybe. All right, I got another idea. Now where are you going? Did you hear what I said? You meet with your brother for the both of us. He makes me nervous. I folded all this, and you're pulling it apart. Please. Be careful with this. Wow. My dress. I remember this dress. - It was on our first date. - Yeah. Did Dad say he's going on a date? What? We never made time for us. What does that even mean? Of course we made time for us. It's always about us, and the house and the kids. No, that's the problem. We never make time for us. You and I. I'm sorry. I gotta find this tuxedo. Of course you do. Where are you going? Oh, I'm meeting Chelsea for this affair at Harlan's. Who's Chelsea? What's an affair? It's the last chance I have of making this deal. - Mm. - Where is it, Sarah? I might've donated it. What? Why? It's not like you've been Prince Charming lately, and I-I had a moment. - All right, think. - Sorry. Whew, I stink. Okay. I know what to do. I'm gonna call Hayden. Here, I'm gonna... Hayden! Hey, buddy. Dad's going on a date with some woman named Chelsea. You can? That's perfect! Okay, I'll see you there in 30 minutes. Wait. He still has his tux from our wedding? Goes swing dancing in it every weekend. - Weird. - Um... Can we talk about this later? Please? - Sure. - Yeah. Okay. Can I use the shower? You know where it is. Thanks. Dad's a huge creep for doing this to Mom. Yeah. What are we gonna do now? I've got an idea. - Wait! - Wait, hold on. Where are my clothes? Kids! Bring my clothes back this instant! Oh, no. You gotta be kidding me. What is wrong with these kids? We are gonna talk about this later! He'll make a great impression. Oh, yeah. Kids! Where are you? Can you come to the kitchen? Hope we're not in big trouble. All right. We got this. Don't worry. Just breathe. Okay. Uh... Anything you'd like to tell me before I go see Uncle Paul? We respect your bravery, all things considered. We want you to know, we think what Dad is doing is wrong. We got your back. Okay. This is not good. Paul. Hey, sis! So glad you could make it. Where's Brent? Oh, it's okay. Come here, come here. It's gonna be all right. I'll make us some tea. When'd you get all this chicken wallpaper? Oh, I just put it up. Pretty snazzy, huh? Yeah. Oh. Chickens. - Sir, what are you doing? - Hi. Uh... Is this a party for Harlan Hames? It is. Yes. Great. Nobody's wearing a tuxedo. ♪ Hey, hey there, baby Something just ain't right ♪ It's not really a tuxedo kind of establishment. Uh, yeah, well, my friend dropped off a tuxedo for you to give to me. A short guy. But nobody's wearing a tuxedo. You know it's not a pajama party either, right? In hindsight, I realize it was wrong to interfere without talking to you first. But... the kids, they just tugged at my heart. So I reached out to an old college buddy of mine in hopes that he would be able to connect me with you and Brent. So this was all your idea? Well, I mean, not entirely. I didn't know that Donovan was gonna create such a media circus. Look, I know you don't always want advice from your older brother, but in my opinion, divorce isn't always the option that people think it is. So I'm just supposed to stay in a miserable marriage? Is it really that miserable? I mean, I recall two lovebirds that couldn't get enough of each other. Yeah. I did fall in love with him. But we're just so different now. Marriage is a loyal partnership. Do you really think God would leave you with just two options? Misery or divorce? That's a myth. Well... the children deserve to live in a home where their parents aren't fighting all the time. The children deserve to live in a home where their parents learn to not fight with each other. Well, we're meeting with the mediator tomorrow, and I don't even know where to start. Sarah, you can get a divorce. That is an option that is certainly available to you, but you owe it to yourself and to your children to be honest about why you're doing it. ♪ Baby, tell me who she is ♪ Great band. Mm. Little Sue and the Cow Tippers. - Oh. - That's Tony on the drums. He's my cousin. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. - Listen, Chelsea... May I call you Chelsea? - Of course. I've been kicking this around for a long time now, and, you know, I have to say, it's not like I love Dolva Tech. You know, like a cat loves a cream jar. But I have to say, right now, Dolva Tech's offer's better than Peterson's. And I got 2,000 loyal employees I look after. It's 500 individuals, 1,500 families, 3,500 children and 300 or 400 grandchildren. You know how many people that is? It's... It's a lot of people, and they're gonna still need their jobs after I retire. Oh, these here, these are my favorites. Mm. Can't get enough of them. - You want some? - No, thank you. - Mr. Hames... - Oh, hey, Chelsea, call me Harlan. Consider allowing Brent Lambert to review Dolva Tech's offer. Brent is our chief strategist in acquisitions. If he fails to convince you that Peterson is a better home for your company, then my job is done, and I wish you and Dolva Tech great success, with no hard feelings. That's mighty big of you, Chelsea. You seem to have a lot of confidence in this Brent fella. - Mm. He's levelheaded, reliable. - And late. ♪ Waiting on you to come home ♪ I think I see the people I'm looking for. Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm so sorry. Sorry, excuse me. This is my favorite song. Sorry. Chelsea, Mr. Hames. You gotta be kidding me. Ms. Dwyer, do you know this fella? Brent, what's come over you? - I can explain. - You know what, son? Pink's your color. I've been looking for slippers like that. Well, I'm... I'm a little bit confused here. Nobody's dressed in a tuxedo. Who wears a tux to a barbecue, Brent? You told me that this was a... I told you to be here on time! And now you mocked me in front of our client by showing up looking like some insane person. - What? - Is this alcohol? Drugs? We're gonna get you help. All right, come on. Come on. Come on, buddy. I am so sorry. I think the pressure just got to him. That's a crying shame when a grown man buckles like that. ♪ Waitin' on you to come home ♪ Divorce is such a harsh word. I prefer the term matrimonial restructuring. And as your court-appointed mediator, and in the spirit of harmony, I would like to welcome you both. Oh, would either of you care for some organic hibiscus-infused moon tea? How much? Oh, a single cup should interface your chakra and body mind, allowing for... How much is this going to cost? Oh, I see. Well, I recommend a minimum of two 90-minute sessions per week, spread out over three to five months. - And that should be enough... - All right. You know what? - I've had enough. - Brent! That's a "no" to the tea? What are we doing, Sarah? Really? Our kids are out of control. I've lost my job. And here we are spending everything just to see who gets what's left. None of this was my idea. Actually, this was all your idea. Can't we just agree that the both of us have made mistakes and move on from there? You know what? Forget it. What, just like that? You're just gonna walk away? We didn't have any help to get married, and we sure as heck don't need anybody's help to get divorced. Mm, I'm so sorry. Did you want some? What? Well, did you give them the tea? Yeah. Okay, thank you. Well, that's that. What happened? Your parents rejected mediation. I guess, from the looks of it, your dad's having a nervous breakdown. Word on the street is he lost his job last night, and he showed up to a charity event in a nightgown and fuzzy slippers. Did you say a charity event? Yeah. Sometimes the pressure can get to be too much for a man. What do we do now? Nothing. We took a shot. It didn't pan out. I don't understand. Don't start that, okay? Cut it out. You're killing me, kid. Come on. You said you'd help. I said I'd try. Okay? Look, I said I'd buy you some time, and that's what I did. I said from the start, there's no way to stop a couple from divorcing. They have to decide that on their own. It's time you kids accept that. Okay? It's okay, Mr. Marshall. I know you did your best. Goodbye, Mr. Marshall. Goodbye. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Now don't you start. We made Dad lose his job. I thought he was going on a date. - It's all our fault. - It's okay, it's not. Paul! Yeah, I'm around back. Hey, you... You got a minute? Sure! How come you have a street sign in your backyard? Oh, that? That fell down out front during the last storm. It was on my to-do list to put them back up. Isn't that a culinary torch that you use to make desserts? Oh, yeah, but it's also a really good welder. Like, I've been watching these how-to-do videos, and it's amazing the uses you can get out of this little guy. All righty. Hey, I'm sorry that I didn't get over here the other day with Sarah. Work has been a little crazy lately. Really? I thought you got canned for wearing a muumuu to a charity event. Hey, it was a pink polka-dotted robe and white, fuzzy slippers, okay? Even better. Trying to make a statement, huh? Well, that's... I guess that's one way to look at it. I'm sorry, it's just that my kids, um... My kids have been acting out, and I think this divorce is taking its toll on them. Yeah, about that. Look, I... I apologize for things getting out of hand. You have no idea. And Donovan has assured me that he is no longer involved in your divorce. Paul... why is it so hard? Well, did you think that turning your world upside down would be easy? I mean, tons of people get divorced every day. That's the point. None of this is gonna be easy. I mean, nobody wins in a divorce except the attorneys. This is tearing us apart. Well, that's exactly what is supposed to be happening. Look, God develops this redemptive plan for the world, and divorce just tears at the heart of it. Yeah, but I don't think you know our situation. Maybe I don't, but your kids came to me because they saw something that you don't. And maybe your marriage is just so beyond fixable that there's just no reason to try any longer. Uh, look, I'm sorry that we haven't been close. I just want to thank you for looking after us. We are a family. It's what we do. Ow! You might want to take a break from all this. Oh. Yeah, probably a good idea. Oh, hey, I'm fixing to glaze a baked ham for lunch. You want to join? With that? Ah! Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, it's... I'm okay. - Might do a crème brûlée! - All right. - Goodbye, Mr. Marshall. - Good night, Bianca. You know what? I need to get this off my chest. Those kids came here sincerely asking you for your help. But you made this all about you. "The new marshal in town." I believe that you can help those kids if you stop being so selfish. You are a good lawyer. Act like it! Well, thank you for your honesty. - I will definitely... - Think about it. Those kids are not the only ones Uncle Paul is helping here. Good night, Mr. Marshall. Good night, Bianca. Hmm. Proverbs 31:8. Proverbs 31:8. "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are vulnerable." Speak up. Four. Come on! Hello. There's a new marshal in town. Pew, pew. Pew, pew, pew. Mr. Marshall. Mr. Marshall? Aw! Looks like you found you a new friend. Huh? Huh? Yeah. That's funny. Bianca. I just want to say that, well, everything you said to me last night is true. I have been a little selfish, and I haven't given this thing my best shot. Pardon? Excuse me? Did you just say that I was right? We got a lot of work to do. Okay, Bianca? Finally! Does that mean that I can have a new coffeemaker? Maybe. - Hey. - Hi. I just wanted to come by. Sorry. Sure you don't want to get that? Yeah. Sure. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for what I said at the mediator's office yesterday. I was out of line. Well, this is unexpected. Thank you. You're welcome. Anyway, I gotta get back to the office. Chelsea was kind enough to allow me to box up my stuff and take the walk of shame, so... Of course. Go. And, uh, see you in court. Yep. Okay. Hello? Isabel. Donovan Marshall here. Mr. Marshall? Listen, tomorrow your parents are going back to court. Mr. Marshall, I get you don't want to help us, but let's not rub salt in the wound. - No, no, no, no. I want to help. - Really? Yeah! I think I found it. Found what? Okay, this is a long shot, but I got one important question for you. Do your parents still love each other? I know they do. Well, then your parents just need to be reminded. Reminded? Isabel, sometimes adults need a little push in the right direction so they can remember why they chose that path in the first place. Okay! Let me think about it. - Bye! - Bye-bye. Reminded? I got it. I knew there was a corazón over there somewhere. See? I told you it was going to be good for you. I'm a pretty good guy, aren't I? I found an extra one. Thought you might need it. Ah! This will fit perfectly. Don't forget to lock up. Hey! Have a wonderful evening. Don't speak to me. Ooh. They don't make 'em like that no more. Okay, anyway. You was right about something being fishy about this whole deal, okay? I looked into the company that was sponsoring the expo that Chelsea was attending, and it's called A... AG... AG... AGZ, AGZ Tech. AGZ Tech is the sister company to Dolva Tech. And I'm pretty sure Chelsea's on the board, but don't quote me on that because I'm still waiting for intel. Of course! Of course, she's... Mm-hmm. Chelsea's playing both sides. It's a slice and dice. All they wanted was Hames's patents. - Mm-hmm. - So, Dolva Tech liquidates Allied, their stock goes through the roof... and Chelsea makes a chunk of change. Boom. Hey. I'm sorry I haven't been more supportive lately. I really am, and I appreciate you looking out for me. Hey, man, look, you're my boy. You're my amigo. Okay? I didn't want to see you go out like that, man. You okay? I mean, you know, bittersweet, but... Oh, it's from Sarah. She wants to talk. You miss her, huh? I do. - Oh! Dad texted back. - Hurry up. "Meet at 6:00." - Delete! Quickly. - Okay. Okay, okay. Send. Delete. You know what, man? Get outta here. Go put on something nice. And don't wear that bathrobe, please. Get out of here, brother. Thanks, Cal. Ah! - Hey, did you finish that project? - Yeah. - And you're ready for your test? - Yes. - Okay. - Almost done. Hey, would you guys mind watching Ruby tonight? Oh, not at all. I can work on some math facts with her. And I can whip up a nice little meal for all of us. Thank you, honey. Okay. Yes! You look beautiful. I haven't heard you say that in a long time. This place has not changed a bit. Yeah. I was surprised you asked me here. Me? You're the one that suggested we... Good evening, and welcome to Tony's. My name is Thomas. I'll be serving you this evening. Could I interest you in a complimentary appetizer prepared especially for you? - Uh, sure. Thank you. - What in the world? You're welcome. - Enjoy. - Thank you. What is this? Did you do this? It must've been the kids. "Why you luv each other." That's definitely Ruby's writing. Oh, look at Ruby. - She's a little chunky. - Little chunky. Our wedding picture. Look at... There's so much stuff in here. Look at... Oh, boy. I did this of you right here. "Do you believe in love at first sight?" Yeah. And I said, "Love at first sight is easy. It's when two people who have been staring at each other for years, that's when it becomes a miracle." You remember what you said to me after that? Come on, Brent, do you remember? Look, I'm tired of kicking this thing back and forth. Get out there, nail down this deal with Dolva Tech. All right? Well, go on! Brent? Do you remember? - What? - I'm so sorry. Will you excuse me just for a minute? What... Where are you going? Don't move. I'll be right back. I promise. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Hames? Well, do I know you? May... May I have a word with you, sir? - Oh, yeah. Wait a minute, you... - We met. Yeah. You're the fella from the barbecue with... Yes. That's... That's me. May I sit? All right, all right. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. Um, about that, I just... I'm Brent Lambert, and I want to apologize for the other night. Unbelievable. Sir, I'm going through some personal issues right now, which is not the reason why I came over here. It's about your company and the sale to Dolva Tech. I'll give you to the end of my drink. Okay. Uh, Dolva Tech plans on chopping up Allied United Farms and selling it off in bits and pieces. I'm almost certain of it. Also, I believe, and I can't prove this, that Chelsea was playing both sides. She sits on the board on one of Dolva Tech's subsidiaries and stands to make a lot of money from the sale of their stock, which is why she sabotaged the sale for Peterson. But she needed to cover her tracks, which is why she set me up, sir. And, honestly, Mr. Hames, if I wasn't so preoccupied with my divorce, I would have seen this much sooner. And... if I wasn't so preoccupied with my work, I would have spent more time with my wife, and I wouldn't be in this position. Sir. So, anyway. I don't like being hornswoggled, Brent. No, you're not, sir. I'm to blame. I'm the one accountable. Hmm. Yeah. Well, blame and accountability are two different things. To be accountable, well, that's to be responsible for fixing things when they go haywire. And blame, that's the price you pay from running away from responsibility. Yeah. - I like you, Brent. - Thank you. I'll have my boys check this out, and if what you say holds water... heads are gonna roll. I appreciate that, sir. Um, excuse me. Okay. Goodbye, Mom. Love you. That was Mom. - She didn't sound very happy. - Well, what are we gonna do? We can't let them go to court tomorrow. We could try "Ruby's got a fever." That always works. Tricks aren't going to work this time, guys. It's up to them. One can be overpowered. Two can defend their selves. But a cord of three is not easily broken. We ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Am I to understand that you both have terminated your legal relationships with your counsel? - Yes, Judge. - Yes, Judge. I see. And what's your dog in the hunt here, Mr. Marshall? Well, Your Honor, it is my clients' wishes to withdraw their petition for injunction and let these proceedings proceed unencumbered. A sensible decision. Well, since there are no further objections in the matter of Lambert vs. Lambert, I hereby order a decree for divorce shall be... Uh, provided, of course, that the litigants can provide satisfactory evidence to that end. Excuse me? Well, Your Honor, may I draw the court's attention to California Code 598.5 subsection 1, paragraph G, which states, "The trial petitioner must present satisfactory evidence that there has been a breakdown of the marriage relationship and that there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved." Now, in light of the fact that petitioner Sarah Lambert has not provided such evidence, I ask the court that may she provide this evidence now? All right. I'll allow it, but make it quick, Counselor. Thank you, Your Honor. Mrs. Lambert, if you will. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. Simply explain to the court why your marriage is so broke that you feel it is not worth your time or effort to repair it. Nothing good is coming out of this. Well, I wouldn't exactly put it like that. Well, how would you put it, Mrs. Lambert? Was there adultery? No, never. Were either you or Mr. Lambert sentenced to prison? Is there allegations of abuse? What? No, you have it all wrong. Oh. I've got it all wrong. Well, then enlighten us, Mrs. Lambert. Please explain to us why we're all here today. I felt so alone. Hmm. And you thought by divorcing your husband, that's gonna make you feel less alone? No, I just wanted Brent to prioritize our marriage and make me feel important as much as the kids and his job. And you thought by nagging him, by blaming him, by withholding your love and support for him... Mr. Marshall, I find your tone unnecessarily hostile. - I just wanted him to... - To what, Mrs. Lambert? To what? - Just to... - To stand up. She just wanted me to stand up for us. And don't ever talk to my wife like that again. Mr. Lambert. Your Honor, I... I thought the value of a man was measured by how hard he worked and how quickly he climbed the ladder of success. But what's funny is as soon as I got kicked off that ladder, the only thing I could think about was... my wife and kids. Last night wasn't a trip down memory lane. Our kids were trying to remind me, reminds us, of... the love we had. And... the love that we've taken for granted. And the love that's still there to be rediscovered. From the moment I saw you... it was love at first sight. You're my everything. And I do remember what I said to you that night. "Do you believe in miracles?" I do. I do! Yes! Order! Order! - I knew it! - Order! - We did it! - Yay! - Let's go home. - Yes. I knew we could do it! Well, it looks like I saved... Yeah, whatever. Case dismissed! And I don't want to ever see any of you again! Bye, guys! I'll call you later. If this gets out, we're ruined. Finished. And that's how we became one happy family! Hey, hey, Paul. Mr. Marshall started helping Uncle Paul at his place. We thought that was a really good idea since Uncle Paul really needed the help. And he was running out of Band-Aids! Ah! - It hurts. - Yeah. Dad finally got his promotion. His boss was not very happy about that. Great. Mr. Marshall surprised Bianca and got her a coffeemaker! Ah! Business was really picking up for them. Thank you, thank you, thank you! And here we are, our first dinner together, where we all just laughed. Dad told corny jokes, and Mom just couldn't stop smiling. And that bread was really, really good bread. Oh, look, Uncle Paul's waking up. Okay, guys, we have to go. But we'll have a session next week. Same time. Bye! That was fun. Yeah. - Hello. - Mr. Marshall? I think I have a few more clients for you. Mark. We should just do what I came here to do. Hot buns! - That was me? - On the oven. You can meet with your brother for the... That would be the doorknob. We're still in the room! We're never invisible! Why is he laughing? "We're never invisible"! So cute. - Ryan. - Hmm? Sorry. I was concentrating not to smile, and then I totally forgot my line. Oh. Okay. - Is this potable water? - Absolutely. - Here we go. Ready? - Are we done with this scene yet? We should be. Oh. Yeah, that was mine. Oop. Whoa, whoa. That's too far. Provided, of course, that the legiti... Uh, legiti... Provided that the litigants can provide satisfactory evidence to that end, of course. I know. I'm snoopy. Oh! Uh, where are we going from? It didn't seem odd? Are you kidding? Better than that low-flying airplane that's gonna attack at any minute. That's not important. Hold on, I forgot my... What's an affair? Is that what you say to a person, when, like, especially, "Your hair's looking clunky." I'm glad you're not my doctor. "You know what? You're gonna die here soon, but..." We need a fart. Yeah. Are you freaking kidding me? It's okay. It's the cats. Am I gonna go in? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, I think... - No, I'm back. I'm back, guys. - Sarah. - Claire? Claire? Claire! - Oh, Sarah's my wife. - Sarah's your wife. Where's the surprise? Surprise! - Oh! I thought... - That was great. The phone has been ringing all morning. That's awesome. Yeah! I love it. Of course I have a plan, Blanca. Sorry. Blanca? What's going on today? Your Honor, my... Sorry. When are we rolling? - Just now. - Oh! And I was on the phone? - Did I get in trouble? - That was very unprofessional. Scene 48, take two. Marker. - What do we do? Oh. - Stop, stop. Hit the button, hit three, hit three. Reset. I love you guys. I had so much fun!
