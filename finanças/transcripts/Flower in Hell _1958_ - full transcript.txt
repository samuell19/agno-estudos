Watch where you're going, jerk! - What's your problem? - I'm sorry. - Where do you think you're going? - To catch that thief. Who the hell is this? Where did this bumpkin come from? Take a hike, you idiot! Where have you been? How many times you've been out today? Couldn't even make a buck. Rice costs so much. We make pennies. We're in a stew. What about you, young man? Where're you from? You don't look like you belong with us folks. Well... I came up from the country a few days ago. A pickpocket ran off with my money the first day I arrived. They'll steal the nose right off your face, I tell ya. - So, who are you looking for? - My older brother. He came to Seoul a few months ago to buy some goods. We haven't heard from him since, so I came looking. I searched everywhere I could think of, but he's nowhere to be found. That so? Oh, couldn't you ask the police for help? - That costs money. - It's a crazy world, I have to say. Hey! I'll see you tonight! - Bye. - Bye. Bye! Sonya. How is it going? - What? - About tonight. Ah. It's going well. - What are you thinking? - You don't have to be like that. Hurry up and go tell everyone. Hey. Get everyone together. - Boss says meet up. - Okay. Have you seen Speedy? Do we have everyone? Yeongsik's missing. I sent someone to find him. Alright. Come on over here then. Have you seen Yeongsik? If you're late today, we'll be in a spot. And don't go into any warehouse like the last time. Oh, here he comes. - Can't find him. - Really? In that case, I'll talk to him later. What? You're napping now? Is he gone? - So did you have fun? - Jealous, all of a sudden? You tease... Are you mad? You are mine. I have no one but you. You get it? What about your brother who's in the army? I'm too ashamed to see him again. I just need you, that's all. Really? Sonya, I'm planning something big this time. If it works out, I'll make a killing. - So please, leave this life behind. - Really? You bring me nothing but this cheap tat these days. - Not buying then? - Not sure... - It doesn't bring in much these days. - Just give me the going rate. Oh, it looks good... You'll get to see him. Really? Is that true? My predictions are always right. - When though? - I'm not sure... You are bound to meet him. But I'm sorry to say... You'll part ways again soon. When will I get to see him? Sir! Shine your shoes! Brother, isn't it you? Good heavens! What've ya done? - I'm... I'm sorry. - Pay for this tofu! I apologize. Brother! - Brother, it's me! - Dongsik! I thought I'd never see you again. I thought there must've been an accident. What happened? Mother's worried sick. What are you doing here? Were you discharged? Yes, it's been about two weeks. - Honey. - Yeah? He must be the little brother you speak of day and night. Are you not going to introduce us? Sure, yes... say hello. Hello. - My... name is Dongsik. - I see. The two brothers couldn't be more different. Don't you think so, honey? - Yeongsik. - Hmm? - Your little brother is quite good looking. - Yeah? Why, you don't think so? - Sonya! - Hmm? Where're you off to? To swim. Wanna come along? Dongsik! Brother... Let's go back home. Sit down. I explained everything last night. You still don't get it? Let's just go home. For mother, please? I told you to take the train tonight and go home. - I'll go home in a few days. - No, I won't go alone. I don't get Sonya. She has money saved up and a man to lean on. Why does she keep living that way? These days, men are all good-for-nothing. Still, until when is she going to take the yankees? We gotta live with our own kind. Get a grip! And think about making money! American or Korean. Men are men. Money comes first. Money's everything. What good is there in making money? We can't be with Americans or with our own kind either. What kind of people are we? What kind? We are the yankee women!. I don't want you to get stuck here like me. If I shouldn't be here, what about you? Just what is it that you're doing here? I thought about it all night, but I couldn't figure it out. - No matter what, you should go back home. - No. There's no way I'm going without you. - [ Can't leave now. - Why not? Brother! - What's wrong with you? - Stop bothering me and go back home! - Honey? - Hmm? Aren't we leaving? Come with us, Dongsik. - I'd rather not. - Let's go, Sonya. Dongsik, are you leaving on the evening train? Dongsik. What do you think of me? What do you mean? - The way we live, [ mean. - What do I know? I suppose... Why would you even care about yankee whores like us? - Sonya. - Yes? - Let's move to the countryside and get married. - Marry you? Let's live like a real married couple with my mother's blessings. I can't live in the country. Then anywhere is fine. Let's live a decent life somewhere else. The world won't just let us get away with things forever. Don't you think we should make as much money as possible now? Money's just money. I'll do whatever it takes. You won't have to do a thing. You know honey, your little brother sure is handsome. More than me for sure. What do you say, Sonya? Will you come to the country? - Stop it. What a headache. - Don't be that way. Tell me. Oh, please. What are you looking at? - What is it? - It's nothing. It's a photograph! Let me see. Oh, it's you and your brother. And here in the middle, your mother. Yes. If not for the war, I'd have been happily married, with my parents' blessings. - Then, your parents... - Died in the war. But there's no point in telling that old story. I just live as the wind blows now, that's all. It's not too late to leave this life behind. Settle down with a decent man. - Who would marry someone like me? - Why not? Someone as nice and clever as you can't find a husband? Then why don't you marry me, Dongsik? See? People say nice things, but then they all get that look on their face. Julie! What are you doing here? Everyone is heading in. Dongsik... Take this money and head back home first. What's wrong? Stop being stubborn and go back. I won't go without you. There's no way. - Wait for us! - Okay, hurry up. Where's Yeongsik? Hey, go get Yeongsik! Hurry up! Why aren't you going? I'm sick. I never dreamed you'd end up like this. Stop worrying about me and you go and make something of yourself. Stop it! Did I ever ask you to worry about me? Dongsik... Why are you being so stubborn? Brother! Here, take it. Brother! Come in. Oh, if it isn't the younger brother! Here, come on in. - Have a seat here. - No, it's fine. - You're going out? - Oh just a party, like always. It's alright. Then I'll ask a little of your time. So, what's brought you here? There's no need for that. I'll be leaving soon. Oh, don't say no. [...came because I have something to say. -Well what is it? ... - Here. - Thanks. You'll have to excuse me, It's so hot. What is it that you have to say to me? T's just.. please break it off with my brother. Oh, is that all? Please let him go back home. Shouldn't you be saying that to him, not me? Don't be like that. Please just let him go. It's not like I have him on a leash. Have some beer. Hello, beautiful! Where you going? Who is it? Dongsik... Don't be that way. How about this? Like this. Doesn't this solve everything? I should just go. Oh, you're so innocent. Come on. Stay and have some fun. Let go of me. Don't be that way. Come here and hold me tight. What's wrong? - Seen my little brother? - Haven't seen him. Hey! Yeah? - Have you seen my brother? - No, not this morning. Julie? - Julie? - Yes? - Hand me my black bag. - Okay. - Where're you going? - To see my sweetheart. Let's go then. Hey... - Have you seen my brother? - No, I haven't. Maybe he's gone back on his own? Where are you all heading? So how'd it go? Come here a minute. Do you know why Sen ya couldn't make it last night? No, why? - She was with Yeongsik's little brother! - What? No way! I'm telling you. I saw it with my own eyes. I'm sure nothing happened. He's her brother-in-law! Brother-in-law? Pfft! Since when does Sonya care about such things? If you can't believe it, I'll tell you exactly what I saw. Have you seen my brother? - Follow Sonya. - Sonya? Follow that car. Hurry! Hurry up. Get in the car. - What should I do? - Follow them. So refreshing to be out, isn't it? Oh, what's that? How about over there? Your hair smells sweet like ripe corn. Are you making fun of me for being a country boy? No, it's not that... I don't know why, but I just like that fresh smell. What do you mean by that? Dongsik! Brother! Honey! - Honey! - Get out of my way! Honey! You bitch! Wake up! Dongsik... Thank you. See you again. What's wrong with you? I'm so tired. Huh? - You... - What are you doing? Yeongsik, what's the matter? What? You jackass! Boss! What's going on? Why pick a fight first thing in the morning? Let's go back inside now. Go back inside! - Calm down! - Let go of me! Dongsik? Julie? How did you know where [ was? Sonya sent this for you. I'm too ashamed to see you now. Dongsik... You don't belong in a place like this. Please, go back home as soon as possible. Yes, I'm thinking of going back tonight. Dongsik... Could someone like me live in the country too? Well... I'm not sure if you could live in the country, Julie. Sonya, just leave my little brother alone. He's my only brother. What exactly have I done to your precious brother? He's so naive. He doesn't know a thing. Just leave him alone, please. So now you're jealous of your little brother too? Sonya... Please don't be that way. This next job will pay off. Then we can settle down somewhere far away. I'm ready to do anything for you. - Brother, let's take a dip. - Not today, the water's too high. Dongsik! Dongsik, no! Brother! Dongsik? Dongsik, wake up! Hello! - What are you thinking so hard about? - It's nothing. Please make my brother happy. I don't know about your brother, but I can surely make you happy. I'm going home to take care of Mother instead of Yeongsik. And atone for what I've done. Okay, is everything ready? It's a bit dangerous this time, unlike what we've done before. But so long as we communicate well, it will be fine. If this goes well... Everyone will make a killing. Is the truck ready? We're set then. Everyone go get some rest during the day. - Boss... - Hmm? Its so hard to make ends meet these days. That will change today. Our boss these days seems a little...you know. It's all because of Sonya. The truck's here! Okay, I'll be back soon. I'll make it work this time for sure. So just wait for me. Don't go anywhere. - Mm. - Wait for me. Oh, what's this? Where are they going? Tonight's job must be really risky. Why, are you worried? Such a loyal brother. No, I should die for what I did. How could I face up to what I've done... It's no use crying over spilt milk. Anyway, I have something to ask. - Will you answer? - Stop it. Please, stop tormenting me. I love you. I need you to be with me. And you're the only one who can save me from here. Sonya... There are much better men than me out there. Dongsik... Don't be that way. Let's run away, somewhere far from here. I want to live a decent life like everyone else. Sonya, do you really think you can lead an honest life? Why not? Let's run away to Hong Kong or anywhere. Wait. I'll be right back. Yes, that's what I'm saying. It's been about two hours. Yes, I'm positive. Yes, you can hold me responsible. Where've you been? I set things in motion for us. What things in motion? You don't need to know. I just made a phone call. A phone call? I reported tonight's job to the military police. To the military police? Why? What do you mean why? It's all for us. - What? - So hardheaded... No one should get in our way in order for us to start a new life. What? You can't do this! How could you do something so evil? Call them back! Hurry up! It's too late. They've already gone to catch them by now. No! Dongsik! Dongsik! Got it. Check the train as soon it arrives and report back. Dongsik! Stop! Wait! Please, help me. Please hurry up! Faster! I'll pay whatever you want. Brother! Brother! Dongsik! Brother! Wait here for a second. Dongsik! Are you crazy? Why are you here? Let's get out of here! They're going to catch us too. Hurry up! Dongsik! Dongsik! Wait for me. Dongsik! Dongsik! Dongsik! Dongsik! Dongsik! Come back with me! Dongsik! Honey. Honey! Honey! I've done nothing wrong, honey! Help me! Somone, help me! Help me! Dongsik! Honey, forgive me just this once, please? From now on, I'll love only you, please. I'll do whatever you say. Anything! I'll do anything for you. Honey! Honey! I'm your beloved wife, aren't I? Please forgive me, just once. Spare my life! [ don't want to die. Brother! It's me, Dongsik. Wake up, Brother! Dongsik... Forgive your foolish brother! No, it's my fault. Brother! Brother! No, Dongsik. Please, do something great with your life. And take good care of Mother. Brother! Dongsik! This is for you to eat on the road. And also, I was holding onto this for you. Julie. Would you like to come to the country with me? - What? Really? - Yes.
