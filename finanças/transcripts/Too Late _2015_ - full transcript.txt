Like in those movies that start out as a simple misunderstanding, then it snowballs until the situation gets completely out of control. And then the main character has to explain everything that happened, but the person they're explaining it to is never really gonna understand because they weren't there. I always thought it would be great if they could just hand them a copy of the movie and say, "Watch this. "It'll explain everything." What? Like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, when the mom comes home at the end of the movie, and everything's out of control, Christina Applegate could just give her mom a tape of Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. The character in the movie has a copy of the movie? Yeah. Like the actual VHS you can buy at the store with the cover and everything? Yeah! That's fucking retarded. But then the mom could watch it, see everything that happened and how it all started out so innocent. Give that bitch a Blu-ray maybe. I mean, wouldn't that be fucking cool? Jesus Christ! Look at that tasty bitch. It was an ordinary day for Matthew and Jesse until a hot piece of ass turned their world upside down. Hello, there. Hey! Hey. Can I ask you guys a favor? My phone died. Do you have one I could borrow? Of course. Jesse, give her your phone. Thank you so much. I'll only be a minute. Sure. Hello. Hey! Is... Um, um... I was looking for Mel. Okay. Is he... There's a girl on the phone for you. I told her you were busy eating my pussy out. Don't fuck around. This is a business line. Sampson. Hey, Mel, it's, uh, Dorothy. About three years ago, we... I remember. Long time, no talk, huh? Um... Is this a bad time? No. I know it's been a while, but... Are you okay? Uh, that's a good question. I don't know exactly. Where are you? I'm on Radio Hill across from Dodger Stadium. Right. Do you know where that is? I do. Yeah, I'm close. Okay. I'll be there soon. Thanks. Uh, just lock up on your way out. I thought we were getting Chinese Food? What the fuck? - It's Mel, huh? - That's right. You want my number, Mel? Yeah, write it down. Thank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. I'm Matthew by the way. Hey, Dorothy. Dorothy, pleasure to meet you. This is Jesse. Hey. Hey. So what brings you all the way up here on this fine morning? Um, I don't know. Just trying to clear my head, I guess. All right. What about you guys? Oh well, uh... We're selling drugs. Really? Yeah, what's your poison? Weed? Mushrooms? Acid? We've got whatever you need to clear your head. Oh, my God. Come on. It's on the house. I don't really do that kind of thing. Ah. Good girl, huh? Hardly. I did ecstasy once. Ooh-la-la. Oh, it's not sexual. You know that. Hmm. It just felt good. Yeah. Do you guys have any of that? I could stand to feel good right about now. Of course. Jesse, give the fine lady some ecstasy. My lady. Thanks. This is so stupid. All right! We gotta meet in the butterfly garden. Ah, so we gotta go see a customer in the butterfly garden, but do you wanna join us for brunch? I'm supposed to be meeting a friend. We're your friends now. Come on. Are you still going to be here in ten minutes? I hope not. Now, now. You stay right here, and we'll come back and we will whisk you away for some mimosas, some French toast, a little bacon-infused caramel sauce. We'll see. Oh, we will see you at brunch! That's against park policy. Oh, my God, have you been there this whole time? You scared the shit out of me. Just long enough to let this tree grow up around me. Now you stopped me mid-stream. Well, that's bad for the kidneys. You want I should close my eyes? No, I think the moment's passed. To be honest I didn't know whether to pipe up or just enjoy the show. I thought I was up here all alone. I didn't realize people came around nowadays. We don't get much foot traffic. Just the lovers, the dreamers, and me. I guess I'm the dreamer. What does that make you? Oh, I'm a different sort altogether. Well, now that we're acquainted... Uh, I've been up for 32 hours and haven't eaten in almost that long. Do you got another one of those Pink Ladies? I always carry two apples, just in case I make a friend. Thanks. I'm supposed to be meeting a friend, but I guess I could pass the time. Well it's a proven fact that every job goes quicker when you got two people on it, so with the two of us working together, we'll get your time passed before the whistle blows. That's a refreshingly sanguine way of looking at the world. I'm Dorothy, by the way. Fontaine. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dorothy. What's your first name? Uh, I guess we'll just stick to Fontaine if it's all right with you. Uh-uh. I'm not calling you Fontaine like one of your locker room buddies. My given name ain't much if you ask me, which of course nobody ever did before seeing fit that it stuck to me. Listen. I've been hearing about red shoes and tornadoes my whole damn life, so you're not gonna get any sympathy from me. Let's have it. Yeah. It's Skippy, if you gotta stick your nose in it. Skippy Fontaine. That's bad. All right. Let's just keep things moving forward. What do you do for a living, Dorothy? I'm a dancer. You mean like ballet, or do you mean maybe the dirty kind? I mean maybe the dirty kind. I knew it. You got that twinkle in your eye. It's kind of you to notice my eyes. There's nothing wrong with it. My mother was a stripper. My grandmother was a stripper. I come from a long line of strippers. Well, I'm definitely first generation. Now, on my dad's side, I come from a long line of park rangers. And strippers and rangers get along real good together, you know why? They both like to bask in natural beauty. You're a hoot. Well, I'm giving you my best material, 'cause it sounds like I got precious few minutes to make an impression before your friend gets here. What time's she due? He. Oh, well that tears it. Nice to meet ya. Oh come on. You only want to talk to me if you think you can get in my pants? Not at all. But it does add an exciting air of mystery to the scene. Well he's not my boyfriend. Not that that should matter. Just a friend, huh? I don't know... He's just a guy I met a few years back and I haven't seen him since. Well, what's so special about him? Nothing special. There's some people that you don't forget, even if you've only seen 'em one time or two. Now that's poetry. Hmm. You think I'll be one of those people? Ask me in three years. Touche. That does not deserve a touche. I'm off my game today. Oh, you just need a little time in bed. Hmm. Sleep, you mean? I do. I just have too much on my mind. You know what I do when I need to take my mind off things? I go see a movie. And, yes, that is an invitation by the way. There's nothing I want to see. You don't like movies? I guess I'm more of a reader. I like old movies. Well then you live in just the right town for that. You've got the New Beverly, the Silent Movie Theater, the Egyptian, the Aero... There's an old movie playing every night of the year in Los Angeles. And did you know that they even screen old movies at the Hollywood Cemetery? Right on the wall of the mausoleum. Now that is where I'd like to be buried, cuddled up in my grave, next to Jayne Mansfield and watching scary movies together. You have quite the death ahead of you. You know my favorite part about going to the movies? The trailers? The chewies. The what? That's one of the four movie food groups. You got your popcorn, you got your soda pop, you got your chocolate, and you got your chewy. And that's my favorite. You gotta have one item from each food group for a balanced meal, and I always save my chewy for last. Mmm-hmm. And you'd better watch out if I don't get my chewy. Yeah. You mean like Twizzlers and things? Mmm-hmm. That stuff is disgusting. Well, what about circus peanuts? You can't tell me you don't at least like circus peanuts. Am I boring you, Miss Dorothy? I'm sorry. I'm just a, a bit distracted today. Well, I got real good ears. Just some trouble with work. Did you go up on stage forgetting you had on your granny panties? No, nothing that serious. Hmm. I just think I saw something I shouldn't have. I've been in trouble for seeing things I shouldn't have. Of course I was standin' on top of the trash cans peering into Sue Ellen Adcock's bedroom window at the time. Hmm, you're good. Well, I was only trying to change my name. See I'd much rather be called Tom than Skippy... ...even if I am one of the peeping kind. Tommy, this is station. You on Radio Hill? Over. Station to Tommy, gonna need that 20. Over. You still near Radio Hill? We're gonna need you to go over to the butterfly garden. Got some suspicious activity there. Over. Station to Tom? Station to Ranger, pick up on that butterfly garden. Over. Sue Ellen Adcock was a shapely lady. Well, anyway... Well, you certainly are cheering me up. Well, I'm doing my best to turn that frown upside down, but your mind is not on my folksy yarns. Don't you hate it when you've got something good going, and then someone comes along and mixes in something just fucking lousy? You mean like when they go and mix cranberries into your chicken salad sandwich? Certainly one example. Or like when you're having a good belly laugh watching reruns of Friends, and they throw in some tearjerker with Ross and Rachel, and they remix the theme song to sound all sad and slow and sappy? Exactly what I was thinking. You're on a roll. Or like when they take an honorable profession like stripping and mix it all up with gangsters and crooked businessmen? Are you a mind reader, Fontaine? I told you it's the family business. You thought I was lying, but I know how these things work. Are those boys at the club threatening you? Do I need to do something about it? I think that's out of your jurisdiction. Are you taking applications? Maybe I should quit dancing and become a park ranger. You'd have to wear this snazzy uniform. You sure you can keep it on all day? Yep, what about you? I don't even like nature, but with all the shit waiting for me down there, I think that I could probably stay up here forever. I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation. I'm serious. I'll do it. You sure now? 'Cause once I get my marching orders, there ain't no calling me off. Hmm. Life's little possibilities, eh? Do you mind if I tell you that you are about the most beautiful girl on God's green earth? No, not at all. My mom used to say the exact same thing to me and it feels nice to hear it again. Did your mom pass on? No, no, no, she's alive and well. She just stopped saying that kind of thing to me around the time that I outgrew my training bra. The ones that love us the most sometimes forget how to say it. Yeah, it was probably just the booze talking. Or not talking... My dad struggled on and off with the potion too. I never touch it myself. Me neither. But I have been known on occasion to let it touch me. Womp-womp-womp... All right, now you got the pep back in your step. We've said a lot, you've seen a lot. Yeah. I should probably go look for my friend though. It was nice meeting you. Well, the pleasure was all mine, Miss Dorothy. And I do hope your troubles disappear on you. Yeah well, like everyone's damn grandmother says, "It will all work out for the best in the end." Well that certainly is one way of looking at things, but it's not the only way. So I ask to use his bathroom and I see he's got a case of Wet Ones on top of the toilet. So? So, what is he a baby or something? Let me ask you something. If someone smeared shit on your forearm, and you used a dry paper towel to wipe it up, would you consider your arm to be clean? I don't know. So I take it this means you don't use Wet Ones. Oh, Jesus Christ. What happened? Hey? Chick! Go see if she's okay. She's not breathing. Oh, Jesus Christ, you fucking killed her. What? They can't blame us if she O.D.'d. Whoa, whoa. You're the one that gave her the dose, okay, not me. She only took one. You mixed up the last batch. Who knows what the fuck you put in it. I let her use my phone. They can trace that shit. I told you to get a fucking burner. Don't you watch The Wire? I can't afford HBO! Jesus, Matthew, what are we gonna do? I don't know. Why are you smiling? I... I can't help it. It's a natural reaction to this kind of thing. It can happen to anybody. Holy shit. Holy shit, you fucking killed her! Oh God. Come on, let's get the fuck out of here! Woo-hoo! Hi boys. Well look at you. Whoa! What are you doing, Janet? I'm just getting ready for tonight. Do you like it? I think you're a little overdressed. Uh, this isn't a prom sweetheart. I was just trying to look nice. I don't think this is the right thing for the occasion. Veronica, what are you wearing tonight, darling? Slacks. See that sweetheart? I, I think you'll look silly wearing this. Why don't you go in there and put on some slacks. I just thought you would like it. I don't want everybody looking at us. Well, you used to. That's why you married me, you always said. I don't think this is the right occasion for this. Janet, why don't you be a sweetheart, darling, and bring me another one of these gimlets? Okay. Nothing for me, darling. There's a way to look nice and then there's a way to look appropriate, Janet. You can't blame her for trying, but Jesus. As long as she keeps making these pastelillos, hell, she can wear a feather in her cap for all I care. I can't think of the last time I had a home cooked meal, much less a few of these "whore's devours." I made Pot Buds last night. Oh, that's right you did. And I added the gorgonzola and the prosciutto and all that other stuff that makes those damn things edible. Kraft Dinner and Potato Buds. Now those are her two favorites and her two best dishes. As long as it comes in a cardboard box... These are the sacrifices we make Roger. Maybe if she got out of bed one day before noon I might be feasting on Cream of Wheat, who knows? Would you light me one of your cigarettes? Those ain't my cigarettes. Those are yours. I smoke Smokies. The originals. Not these Lil Lil shits. She won't buy them herself because she don't want to admit she's a smoker, so she makes me buy these little things. Hell it's like trying to drink a milkshake out of one of those little red coffee straws. I miss my Marlboros. Suck on that, honey. We certainly ended up with a couple of fine women, didn't we Roger? They're a couple of good girls, but "ended up" might be a bit premature. Do you have any tampons? No, I got my tubes tied. Why would you do that? Because Gordy said he didn't want to have kids. No, but the next one might. * On human behavior Are you getting that, Janet? Would you mind answering the door? I have to use the toilet. * I don't know why, and I don't know how * But she's nobody's... There's somebody at the goddamn door. Are you fucking kidding me? "Open the fucking door." Hello there. I got into a little car accident down the street and I was wondering if I could use your phone. Come on in. Aw, thank you so much. Can I offer you another drink? That would be lovely. I'm Sampson by the way. The bar's over there. Everyone's drinking gimlets today. Oh. Can I offer you one as well? No. I don't drink. Do you want a cigarette? Oh, I don't smoke. Do you want a... Do you want a painkiller? Not just right now. Isn't it a shame when two people can't agree on a vice? They're not vices, they're habits. Oh. I think habits are something different. Like I've got this thing where every time I get in my car I flip down the visor to... That's a routine. Oh. Do you, uh... Do you want some pot? I think we have a winner. Hey. Wow. You have a lovely home, Mrs. Lyons. I haven't left this home in 13 days. Oh, there's no place like home. There sure isn't. Hell, I'd be happy if he just took me to the damn grocery store. I'd be thrilled if he just came home one night, brought us home a pizza, rented Iron Man 3 and said, "Hey baby, howzabout you and me make a night of it?" He sounds like a louse. Why don't you leave him? You ever been married? Not that I can recall. I said, "Till death do us part." And apparently there aren't any vows requiring dinner and a movie, so I guess, you know, technically he's held up his end of the bargain. I've got no real reason not to live up to mine. That's a bunch of shit. Maybe. Maybe. Where the hell am I gonna go? I'm too old for the dating scene now. You've been too old since you turned 22. You're one of those people that lives their entire life in the past, in the future and never gives a thought to the present. I know because I'm one of those people too. Is that so? Come run away with me. I'll take you somewhere new. You are one of those hopeless romantics. That's what you are. Oh... I bet you fall in love with a new girl every day. No. Well, there is a girl in the bathroom over there taking a shit who will make you forget all about me. And I don't make enough money for you. That's the real problem. What do you do? I own a small business. Mostly freelance work. Oh, very specific. Now you sound like my husband. He owns a strip club. I was in love with a stripper once. I bet you still are. I bet she has a heart of gold too. You're very pretty, Janet. Yeah, the boys still whistle sometimes. I looked it up. You still get your period when you get your tubes tied. I found your tampons under the bathroom sink. I haven't forgotten about you. Do you still need to make that phone call? Yes, ma'am. Come on. Let's go. This is Mr. Sampson. He got himself into a little car accident down the road and needs to use the telephone. Have a seat, Mr. Sampson. Can I get you boys anything? I would love another of those delicious gimlets if you wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind. It's a ritual, by the way. Not a routine. The visor thing I was talking about. I just thought of it. Hand him the phone, will you, Roger. Sorry about that. Lieutenant Guercio please. Jim. Mel Sampson. I need some law. I'm at the home of Gordy Lyons. Address is 73 West... Ha! I thought you might know already. Hurry on over. I've got a murder sign you can hang on him. How soon can you be here? Send some uniforms over first then. His dog is growling and I left my heater in the car. I'll see you soon. Don't bother Roger. So you're the eye. I'm the eye. You're very cute, Mr. Sampson. Am I supposed to know what that phone call was in, uh, relation to? I don't expect you to. I imagine there's dozens of reasons the homicide boys would be interested in you. Aw, hell, he didn't call nobody. He dialed the number and never pushed talk. You were on a little fishing expedition weren't you, but you didn't catch nothing. Did you really crash your car? Sadly, yes. What do you drive? 1980 Trans Am. Still, it hurts. It sure does. Check it out, would you, Rog? Goddamnit. Ro... Ronnie! Go on over there and see if there's a car down there. There's a car down there. Is it wrecked? Yeah, it's smoking. What did I tell ya? Well, what the hell does any of this prove anyway? Mm, thank you, Mrs. Lyons. I'll be inside if you, uh, guys need anything else. No, stick around, Janet, and hear what your husband really does for a living. I already know what he does. Then let's set it to music. Three days ago, I stepped in some gum, and it started me asking questions. So I punched some people in their fat faces. I threatened various kneecaps with blunt objects. On several times I brandished my revolver. I spent the pathetic amount of mattress money I had on bribes and payoffs. I did these things because I wanted information. And I got my information. And I was certain this would all lead me to a body. But the only body I found was the one I started out with. A girl named Dorothy Mahler. And much to my surprise, you didn't have Dorothy killed to cover up another murder or because she had gone Federal. You had her killed for the stupidest fucking reason I've ever heard of. You had her killed because she found some Polaroids of you getting a blow job from a woman that wasn't your wife. What is this shit? Well, that's you. That's your... And that's... Not Janet. I found some photos like that once, remember Rog? Got some diamonds out of the deal. They're in a drawer somewhere. Oh, knock it off, Ronnie. You boys and your Polaroids. That's a fascinating tale, Mr. Sampson, with some mildly convincing fabrications. I'm very curious. How did you expect to arrest me without a gun? Oh I... I didn't come here to arrest you. I came here to kill you. And just how do you plan on doing that? I'm going to strangle you, Gordy. With my bare hands. That's a slow way to kill a man. I think Roger here might have something to say about that before you're finished. Well to be honest, I didn't quite plan on Roger being here. Oh! Hey Roger, why don't you go fetch your boss's camera? I want to remember the look in his eyes when I choke the life out of him. Oh, hell, Gordy. All this talk makes me want to paint a landscape. I always thought you were a fucking faggot. I could have lived with that. Goddamnit, Janet. Point that some other direction. All right, Janet, Janet, Janet, please, Janet, you're doing my job for me. Roger, take that fucking thing away from her. No, you get up there and slap it out of her hand. The most... Worst that would happen is you get a flesh wound. I gave up my youth for you. Sing it, Janet! Roland Emmerich was gonna put me in a movie. Goddamnit, Roger. Do something! I ain't putting my hands on no woman. No, sure, you'll just send your son Skippy to do it for you. You better watch your step, boy. You know what, sweetheart? Shoot Roger too while you're at it. You said... You said you were gonna whisk me away like the Prince of Monaco. That's a fine son you've got, Roger. You teach him to play baseball and ride a bike and maybe snap a neck? I made a mistake, Janet. It happened years ago. When I was your age, boy, I was snapping three necks a week for a buck twenty-five an hour. Let me guess, Gordy. It was one of the girls down at the club? One of those, quote, "Meaningless inventory items "that couldn't possibly interest you at all"? What the fuck did you think he was doing down at that club? Jesus. Put your pants on and suck it up. Sit down! That's not a goddamn hair dryer, Janet. Sit the fuck down! You ask me for a tampon? You're gonna need a fucking tampon for your fucking chest! Janet, listen to me. Those fucking girls slipped me something. They... Viagra or... Or ecstasy or something. I was bonkers. I was out of my mind, sweetheart. That ain't the same story you told me about that Mahler girl. Whoo-hoo. What a mangled web we leave. It was just a dumb girl's mouth. A place to put it. It didn't mean anything! You said she knew things about some certain business activities. I have a mouth, Gordy. I have a heart and a soul and a mouth and a youth and it was all yours. You said she wasn't gonna stay told. Janet, you don't know what it's like to be a man my age. Things don't work like they once did. It... It was a rare occurrence. I felt the need to grasp the opportunity. You weren't around. I am sorry. You said she was going to bring us all down. You weren't around, Janet. It was a practical decision. Just like having Dorothy killed. Sure, all she did was open the wrong drawer, but it's much safer to have her killed. You didn't say you wanted her killed because she saw some photos of you getting your pecker polished! That's enough, Roger! - Best to be practical. Roger's son will take care of everything. Snap a neck and it's all over with. Should I be flattered, Gordy? You'd kill an innocent girl just to spare my fragile feelings? Do I mean that much to you? I panicked. I just didn't know what else to do. I... I... Look, I have never cheated on you, and I will never cheat on you again. And if he does he'll just kill some more innocent people so you don't find out. And why just kill the girl who saw the photos? I mean, why not kill the girl who did the actual blowjob? I mean, Jesus Christ, Gordy. It don't make no fucking sense! Now that is an excellent point, Roger, and I'm glad you brought it up. I've had men killed before. I won't lie about that. You shut the fuck up. It's become routine. I forgot about the consequences. It just seemed like an easy fix, baby. Is it easy, Gordy? I wouldn't know. Goddamnit, Janet, I am sorry! Whoa, all right now. Oh! Okay, I think that takes care of everybody. Oh, Jesus. Don't! I need to change my life. Oh, man! Get down! Oh, get down! Hey! Jilly Bean, move your ass. There's nobody fucking here. Coming to the stage next, spicy and sweet, Cinnamon. Cinnamon, get your ass up there. Hey there cowboy, would you like to end the evening with a lap dance? Not tonight, thanks. - Ah... Let me tell you what's going to happen in the next few minutes. Fifteen other girls are going to come up asking you the exact same thing. It's just about closing time and all the girls want to squeeze in one more dance. Now if you buy a dance from Sheila over there, she'll talk your ear off about her kids, child support payments, her deadbeat ex-husband, and just about every other unsexy thing you can possibly think of. And that one, Rachel, yeah well, she's got herpes. And yes, I know you're not going to get herpes just from one lap dance, but now that I mentioned it, you're not gonna be able to look at her without thinking about it. Sorry. And Cecilia, well... Actually she's probably upstairs blowing the boss right now. And that frumpy little thing in the corner, eh... She'll shake her ass about as sexily as a concrete mixer, all the while thinking about getting home to read Dostoevsky and play Sudoku with her cats. What I'm trying to say is, if you're waiting for a better offer to come around, it's not going to happen. So why don't we spend a few minutes together before we each go home and cross another day off our calendars. Not tonight, thanks. I suppose you'd like to sit here in the back and watch for free where you don't have to tip. Would it make you feel better if I told you I was near-sighted? I can see your contacts. All right, you got me. Let's go. Oh, no that's not for a lap dance. That's for your speech, and for letting me get back to my Old Grand-Dad. Fucking asshole. Pour me a drink. All right, ladies and gentlemen, that was Cinnamon. Let her know. Let her know. Hey cowboy, would you like to end the evening with a lap dance? God, your eyes are beautiful. Thanks. I'm sorry, I've just never seen them before. So how about that lap dance? I'm Mel. Dorothy. You don't look frumpy. Oh, slow down with the compliments. I'm supposed to be the one sweet-talking you. Your associate over there called you frumpy. Oh. Well that's Jill and she doesn't like me very much. I think I just joined the club. You don't like me very much either? She doesn't like me. Ah. Are you one of those guys that likes to strike up a conversation around closing, and then wants to continue it at a coffee shop, or maybe my apartment or your apartment or a hotel room? Does that happen a lot? I don't let it happen a lot. But you do let it happen? No comment. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. Yeah, I guess not. The answer is no. I'm not one of those guys. Good. So how about that lap dance? Come have a drink with me. I thought you just said you weren't one of those guys. You said those guys ask you for coffee. I'm asking you out for a drink. I don't drink. Good girl. Yeah, "Good girl." Don't tell me you're one of those Travis Bickle types that wants to save me? No, no. You're a big girl now, and I'm not any type. I'm just trying to be friendly. People don't come to these kind of places to make friends. Oh, I've made life-long friends in all sorts of strange places. That's a lie. I don't think you have any life-long friends, otherwise you wouldn't be here. You're right. I've let relationships lapse. I'm sorry. I... I don't know what's gotten into me. I just... I guess all of a sudden I felt like I could read you, but it's not my place. It's okay. I can handle candor. Is that what that was? It might have been bitchiness. Okay. Well, let's split it down the middle and call it "sass." Deal. What do you do for a living, Mel? I'm a private investigator. Oh, a shamus. Are you working on a case? Uh, it's my night off. So you wanted to spend the night looking at some naked girls. I was next door, actually, listening to my friend Sally Jaye sing some songs sung blue. Only I wasn't hearing the songs. I was... I was hearing Marley's chains rattling all around me, and I decided I needed something new in my life. Does that ever happen to you? Sure. That's how I ended up here wearing nothing but my First Communion necklace. Last call for lap dancing. Where the hell did you get those eyes? The usual way I guess. Sampson, aye? Yeah, yeah, like Samson and Delilah. Your hair's not that long. Well I'm not that strong. Maybe. But you do have a thing for Philistine women. Your gun's showing. I've got a permit for it. It's not that. It's just not the first one I've seen tonight. Yeah? Yup. See that guy over there? Well I asked him if he wanted a lap dance. He offered to buy me a drink too. And then when I said no, he showed me the gun sticking out of his waistband. Suggested that I perform fellatio on it. Why's he still here? Who am I gonna tell? He's probably a friend of the boss. We get all sorts of seedy types. Stay here. Excuse me, ma'am. Where is it? What? Where's the piece? What? My mistake. You know this guy? Don't worry about it, sweetie. All right everybody, this is the last dance, the last song, and last call. Hey cowboy. Not tonight. ...is still calling on you to make it rain, so get those singles out for Cinnamon, Pony, Rainbow, Dollhouse, and Dancer Legs. - You have to leave him. Let 'em know! He's completely taking advantage of you and if you don't... The fuck are you doing in here? I must be lost. Sure. You must have missed that left turn back in Albuquerque. Hey Freddie, will you show this gentleman how to get the fuck out of my dressing room? You embarrass me, sweetheart. A man doesn't like to ask for directions. I can find my way out, Fred. I saw you found that better offer as well. Don't be so hard on yourself, kid. Your face is an acquired taste, but I'm getting used to it. We are closing down. They'll be here tomorrow too. Finish it and get the fuck out. Whoo, yeah! Strap me to the mast, Sally! Hiya, Mel. Hey. Wanna come up and join us on one? I think you could use me more down here. This is our last song. You guys have been great. Hey, another Grand-Dad? Yeah, bonded. All right. * I can't find the moon * In the middle of nowhere * I can't find the moon * In the middle of nowhere * Kind of makes you wonder * What darkness can disguise * When I can't find the moon * In the middle of the night * I can't find the moon * In the middle of nowhere * When I get there * I don't know how I'll get back * Is it better * To want it than to lose it * Once you have it? * There's a motel room in Amarillo * Waiting for me * There's a motel room in Amarillo * Waiting for me * It's the only destination * I have in mind * And I can't see nothing but a train going by * So is that your idea of what bad guys do? Ask you to pleasure their gun? I was thinking on my feet. It was a dirty trick. No. It was a test. I wanted to see if you were the kind of guy who would stand up for me. You passed. This was a test too, and you failed. You shouldn't go out for drinks with strange men. I could be dangerous. I've always had a natural trust for strangers. I guess my mom forgot to give me the speech. Well, you just got it. Do you still wanna buy me that drink? You don't drink. Nah, it's a special occasion. All right, in a minute. Uh, this is the last song. How's your dance card looking? Empty. Oh, God. Okay. Whoa! Okay. What are you giggling about? I'm on drugs. What are you on? Ecstasy. Some of the girls were passing them around in the dressing room and I've never done drugs before, so... Why start now? That's a silly question. Because it's "now" every time you do anything, so if everybody always asked that question then nobody would ever do anything. It would always be too late. All right. Mmm. Are you okay? I don't feel good. How many did you take? I took two. I didn't... I didn't feel anything after the first one so I just took another. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shake and shake the ketchup bottle. None will come, and then a lot will. You're okay. Okay. Um, I can't move. Can I just stand on your feet like a little girl and you can dance for me? Climb on. Ooh... Better? Mmm. Okay. I like this song. I kept your business card. Mmm. I'm sorry that I cried wolf back there. I swear I'll never do that to you again. Ah, you can shout "wolf" from the rooftops. You could title your debut LP Wolf. You can name your first-born son "Wolf." Hmm. I'll come running every time. You're sweet. Hmm. Come on. Mmm. Quarter to two, guys. Noise ordinance. Oh, come on, Chipper. Them's the rules, Sally. Jesus. Come on, one more quiet one. Come on. I'm beat. One more, come on, Sally. Why don't you play one? Not tonight. Oh, please? Why don't you play that one you were noodling around with the other night at my place. I don't remember. You know. The one when you were drunk. Oh, that helps. Come on. Come on. Jesus, you put me on the spot a little here, Sally. Oh, well, here's a piece of it. Um... I think this is what you're thinking of. Yeah. * Go back to sleep * Soon it will be light * She moans * And slides down further * Gotta move your car by ten * As I lay down with Mary * Again Yeah. * I close my eyes * And I have a dream * And I see her face * And I wonder when * Will I lay down with Mary * Again * I've got no game * I got no plan * But I do what I can Yeah. All right. Not bad, Mel. Eh, you know, three chords and some sap to hold it together. That's the secret formula. Hmm. It was. My mom's name is Mary. Yeah? A lot of good women named Mary out there. Mmm, a few of the other kind too. Hmm. So what happened to her? Who? The girl in the song. Nothing happened. I made it all up. What? That's what happens when you've got no one in your life to write about. Hey! Jilly Bean! Jesus Christ, Sally. You know this guy? Please pardon the interruption while we change reels. Due to technical difficulties, there will be a forty-five second delay between each reel. I can't let her stay in this house. You won't have to worry about that. She's determined to leave this city, and she wants to get away as soon as possible. I hope she does. I hope she can. I thought I smelled dick. You mean you can smell with that thing too? I thought you just used it for steam-cleaning shirts. You're the last one that ought to be bringing noses into this. Oh, yeah? What's wrong with my nose? Nothing. I'm just still trying to figure out if it's igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary. Beats me. I just remember it's the same type of rock as your heart. Well, that's easy then. Igneous. It used to be on fire, but that was a long time ago. Didn't you used to have a heart? It's broken. Did I do that? A long time ago. Looks pretty fresh to me. I heard you skipped town with a mute boxer. Oh. That. The honeymoon over? Let's just say we've run out of things to talk about. I'm sure you'll land on your feet. You're looking handsome as ever. I'd say the same about you, except there's the small matter of that beard you're working on. Abe Lincoln didn't free the slaves with a baby face. And where did you get that necklace? Mug an eight-year-old girl? Dorothy Mahler gave it to me. You used to work with her back at the club. Oh, I remember. That's probably not all she gave you. I always hated that bitch. Oh, damn it. Is this your show? Yep. We run two double features every night and fights on Saturday afternoons. "Boxing" wouldn't be quite accurate. These dumb yokels are cutting into my screen 2 feature. You got a funny way of laying low. Oh. With this face I never learned how. Still, it's not bad. It's a money pit. I even have to run the projectors myself. Where'd you pick up that trade? From a projectionist. Yeah? What did you teach him? The Watusi. Are we doing the jealousy bit now? I didn't get the new pages. Well... Come on. I mean, you always said I taught you everything you know. You were old enough to be my teacher. I don't remember any imparting wisdom to go with it. And you were an empty vessel, but that wasn't wisdom I was filling you with. Let's knock it off before one of us eases into a soft shoe. What are you doing here? I gotta hang a collar on a guy. Here? He's right over there. What'd this guy do? He murdered somebody. Anyone I know? I don't think so. You wanna back me up, for old times' sake? Ladies and gentleman, after 22 hard-fought rounds, the winner, by technical knockout, is Fred. Come on. Please give Fred a warm round of applause. I gotta lace up the next reel. He fought his heart out. Fred, please visit the concession stand to claim your free popcorn. Stick around, fight fans, for our feature presentation of Alan Rudolph's poignant drama Choose Me, starring Keith Carradine, Lesley Ann Warren, and Genevieve Bu... Bujold. Bujold. You still see Sally? Ah, just the occasional Skype session. L.A.'s a bit hot for me right now. What'd you pull back there? A failed extortion attempt, for one. I found some pictures a few weeks back of the old boss getting blown by one of the girls. I had an inkling he wouldn't want his wife to see them, so I tried cashing them in. Didn't go as planned. What happened to the photos? Fuck if I know. They weren't where I stashed 'em. Maybe I stuck 'em in the wrong locker. All I know is I got the fuck out of there. I wasted a year of my life with you. What else would you have been doing? So much. Why are you being so cruel to me? You're a liability, Jill. Don't talk to me like that. You're the one who taught me how to shoot. I saw an old film noir at the Egyptian awhile back. The tagline on the poster read, "When a man goes to the devil, he usually takes a woman with him. "This man took three." I need some air. Uh, the men's toilet is full of shit. It's taken care of. A fella tells me you Asian girls have sideways cunts. I'm only half Asian. Mine runs diagonal. I oughta wash your mouth out with some soap. What the fuck are you lookin' at? Her. That's my wife, you son of a bitch. You're a lucky man. Yeah. She's a bad girl. I don't think so. But if she is, I made her that way. Ah! You must be the white half. Or else you've got a chink dick. You lost me, old man. Oh please, call me "son." Who was that old cop friend of yours? Used to say you had the Crimson Touch? Everything you touch ends up covered in blood, one way or another. Fortunately I've just been touching myself since you left. I'm in trouble, Mel. I've had one eye on you. I won't let anything happen. I can't watch these movies anymore. Every night, I see Barbara Stanwyck or Myrna Loy and I think how beautiful they were. Now they're dead, and it's gonna happen to me. Not tonight, it's not. You keeping up with your target practice? I don't need practice. I shot and killed a man after we split. That would never have happened if you were still around. Maybe not. I feel so violent. I'm worried for my soul. Your soul looks good from where I'm standing. Your aim is true, Jill. That's the problem. I'm gonna grab a smoke. Have one of mine. No more Old Hats? Ultra Lights. Healthy boy. Baby steps. Don't tell me this is your heap? Don't you like it? It's perfect for a man in your line of work. I bet tail jobs are a cinch. That never was my forte. What happened to the Firebird? Crashed it. Yeah, I crashed my Boat-Tail too. We gotta slow down, baby. Hey, I thought you only drove American? Well, you never know when something more exotic will come along and fall into your lap. Jesus Christ. That was fucking terrible. Give me a break. I'm out of practice with you. Whose fault is that? You got a gun for me? What about you? If I have a gun I'm going to kill him, and I'm trying hard not to do that. You ready, Jilly Bean? Let's add some horns to this thing. Just keep stuffing that popcorn in your face. There's a gun trained on you right now. Well, you're the girl who sold me my popcorn. That must have been somebody that looks like me. I find that hard to believe. Shut up. You and I are going for a ride to the Sheriff's station. I haven't had my chewy yet. And I get awful angry if I don't get my chewy. You murdered Dorothy Mahler. You did it because your daddy told you to and because you're a psychopath. Are you a police officer? I'm a private cop, and I'm bringing you in. And you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison. Now that's certainly one way of looking at it. But, uh, it's not the only way. Skip it. Cuff your right hand to the wheel. I'll take that now. Sure you can trust yourself with it? Sure. I've got my druthers all back in the right place. You always misuse that word. You make a wrong move I'll shoot you in the kidney, then dig the bullet out with my dirty hands for a souvenir. Start the engine. Uh-uh. It hurts my feelings when you say I broke your heart. It was me that woke up alone that morning. I'm trying to be a better person, Jill. I'll catch you on the base side, Mel. Ah. Projectionist humor. Stay sweet, Jilly Bean. Let's go. Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Jesus. Hiya, Jilly Bean. Oh, God. I'm gonna go call an ambulance. Stay with me. What happened? It's all your fault. I was distracted and he got the jump on me. I was thinking about you. Don't say that. I knew you'd be the death of me. Baby please. Let me go call an ambulance. I want you here with me. I don't want anyone to bother us. I've gotta go do a changeover, baby. Otherwise the reel's gonna end and the screen's gonna go dark, and people will get mad and they'll start looking around. And they'll find us here, and bother us. So let me go do that and then I'll come right back here and stay with you, okay? I've seen this movie. This is the last reel. I've missed you for so long. Are you my girl? I'm your girl. I've always been your girl. But I've been lost, Jill. I've been violent too. Your soul is good, Mel. I know your soul and it's beautiful. Let's make a kid together. Okay. Okay? Okay. Right now? Okay. Baby, you've lost a lot of blood. I don't know if I can get you hard right now. We can make a baby. And I can teach her to ride a bike, and play guitar, and baseball. They have Old School Sesame Street on DVD now. We can show her that instead of the Elmo shit. And I can take her on walks down to the creek where I grew up. But it's not there anymore. Sweetheart, you and I would make the ugliest damn kids. This wasn't just kismet tonight, was it? Gordy sent that guy after me. He was here to kill me. Could've been... Stepmother... When did you... What is that tattoo? That's a Jilly Bean. Sing to me, Jilly. Baby, let me go call an ambulance. Sing me that song you used to dance to at the club. Baby. Just that one song, and then I promise, I'll let you go call an ambulance. Okay. Okay. * I said if I'm in luck I just might get picked up * I said I'm fishin' trick and you can call it what you want, girl * I said I'm wigglin' my fanny * I raunchy dancin', I'm a doin' it, doin' it * Try not to pass out Mel? Mel? Oh, God. Hey, we're out of quarters. Why the fuck did you change the price to $7.50? Oh, my God. Help. Somebody help. Somebody help! Jesus Christ, this guy's fucking dead! Shake that ass, popcorn girl! Shake that ass! Oh, would you stop that. He's on his way up here. Please get dressed. I am dressed. Oh, yeah right. Are these the only pants you brought to wear? Yep. Well, will you put them on? Dress me, Mommy. Oh for heaven's sakes, Mary, I wish you'd take this seriously. I'm excited. I think it's about time a couple of us hens got some dick in here. Don't talk like that. Well, that's what they're called. "Dicks." Do you have any brandy? You're supposed to offer him brandy. He's not going to ask for it, but he will expect it. No, Mary, I don't have any brandy. She is your daughter and all I'm trying to do is... Mother, I love you. I love you very much and I promise you, Dorothy's okay. She's just... She ran off with some guy for a few days and she's having the time of her life and the last thing she's thinking about is me and you. Now go get the door for the dick... Dick-tective. And I promise you I will be on my best behavior. You're just so easy to fuck with, Mommy. All right. Would you please get the door? I want to be seated when he arrives. Of course. God, Mary. Thank you. Ugh, this damn music. Ready? Yes, ready. Yes? I'm looking for Mrs. Mahler. I'm Miss Mahler. May I help you with anything? Oh, Mary... Would you come in, Mr. Sampson? And don't mind my daughter. She's feeling theatrical this morning. Please have a seat. Thank you. I'm Eleanor Mahler. And I can't really say that I'm happy to meet you but I'm relieved that you're here. I understand, Mrs. Mahler. Would you care for a drink? We're out of brandy. I'm fine, thanks. I found your name and your phone number in the address book on my granddaughter's computer. Your name was the only entry inserted in there and, uh, it said you were a private detective. That's correct, ma'am. How do you know Dorothy? We were friends. Have you heard from her recently? Well, I should rephrase that. We were friends for a night. It was several years ago. We got along and I gave her my card in case she ever needed anything. Mmm-hmm, I see. I see. Well, we haven't seen Dorothy in five days now. Is that unusual? Well, she and I are rather close. We typically telephone once a day. And Dorothy never indicated to me that she was going to be leaving town. So when we arrived in Los Angeles, I went straight to her apartment and I saw that she hadn't fed the cats, so I... I snooped. Didn't find any clues, so to speak. But her mother thinks that she's just off being young and falling in love, and I don't believe it. Why not? I don't know, exactly. But I... I feel like I know the girl and it doesn't fit. What does your granddaughter do for a living? She's a stripper. Did you know that? Yes. But you wanted to know if I knew it. Mrs. Mahler, this sounds like a missing person's case. Why not go to the police? Oh, I... You know I... I love my granddaughter very much, but she's a very troubled girl. What I... What I know about her life is shameful. I fear that what I don't know about her life is illegal. And it may sound corny and pretentious, but the Mahler name still draws water here in this town, and I'd like to keep it that way. I see. Look, I can write you a check right now for your retainer. What is your rate? Thank you but there's no need. Dorothy was a friend. Yes, you mentioned that. Even still... I would feel better paying you. I'd like to interview each of you separately, to find out as much about Dorothy as I can. Would it be all right if I started with your daughter? I suppose that's all right. Look, I haven't had breakfast yet. I haven't eaten for days for that matter. So I'll just be downstairs in the restaurant when you're ready for me. Very good, ma'am. Okay. Uh... I... I don't know what your night with my granddaughter meant to you, Mr. Sampson. It meant a great deal, Mrs. Mahler. Thank you. That was very clever. Excuse me? I said that was very clever. The way you got rid of my mother. I liked it. Friends for a night, huh? Ah, that's really cute. I think even my sweet, innocent mother picked up on that one. I meant what I said. Isn't there some boyhood fantasy about first the daughter, then the mother? I can't remember. I, uh... I think you have the wrong impression of me, Miss Mahler. Oh, I don't think so. Why don't you have a seat? Not there. I think we should talk about Dorothy. I think you think I'm a bad mother. No. I think you think you're the one that needs saving right now. I don't have a P.I.'s intuition, Mr. Sampson, but I do have a woman's intuition. And whatever it is I need right now, I think you need it too. If you want to call it "saving," that's all right by me. You're a beautiful woman, Miss Mahler. Don't make me feel stupid. I don't throw invitations out like this every day. Come on, let's have some fun. I've been cooped up in this box with my mother for days. I can feel the walls closing in on us. Don't get smart with me, peeper. I'm not smart. Good. Then stay dumb. I'll show you where to put everything. There's more than one way to skin the cat that got your tongue. What's the matter? You don't like 'em? I've seen them before. Not like these you haven't. I've seen them before. Twenty-one years ago, there lived a young man who didn't know what to do with his life. I don't need a bedtime story. On a whim, the young man ordered a correspondence course that promised to teach him how to become a private investigator. He would sit in a coffee shop on Melrose Avenue reading this giant book, because he couldn't stand to be alone in his apartment. Yeah? Cool. So fucking what? One day, the big book suggested an exercise. In order for him to practice his tailing skills, he should pick out a random stranger and follow them. Just then the young man glanced out the window, and he saw a beautiful girl walk by on the street outside. Jesus, would you shut the fuck up already? He left the book behind, and he ran outside to catch up with her. He followed her. Of course, she didn't actually live in Hollywood. It couldn't be that easy. She lived all the way in Newport Beach. Regardless, he continued following her for days, and he learned all about her life. But on the fifth day he got reckless. Before he knew it she was standing right next to him at a jukebox, criticizing his song selections. How could I forget a face like that? His cover was blown, and he had no choice but to embrace the situation. He introduced himself with a fake name. He bought her a drink, several drinks. They went back to her apartment and they spent the night together. In the morning, he got dressed and slipped away while she was still sleeping. He didn't leave a note. She never saw him again. You piece of shit. The next day, the young man resumed the tail, this time being more careful. Over the following months he watched her body change. She grew bigger. There had been no other men. He knew the child inside her was his. Goddamn you. Every day he thought about going to see her, to assume his paternal responsibility. But the girl's family was quite wealthy, and the young man felt he had nothing of worth to offer his child, financial or otherwise. The girl gave birth to a daughter, and she named the child Dorothy. He continued to follow the girl and her baby, watching Dorothy grow up from afar... No, no, stop. You stop this fucking fairy tale bullshit! I don't want to hear it. Three years ago, the young man was not so young anymore. He was lonely and full of remorse and he went to see his daughter, who was all grown up. He intended to tell her who he was and how sorry he was for abandoning her, even though he was never far away. But when he finally spoke to her, the right words didn't come out. Is this how you were going to tell her? Like you're... Like you're some Prince Charming and... And she and I are a couple of fucking frogs? The man and his daughter parted ways that night, and she still didn't know who the man really was. Stop, stop, I don't want to hear one more word of this once-upon-a-time bullshit. You look at me in the eye and you speak to me in first-fucking-person. Dorothy called me three days ago asking for help. By the time I got to her she was dead. Her body is in a Los Angeles County morgue. Downtown. I removed her identification. You'll need to identify her. She's listed as a Jane Doe. You bastard. I saved this for you. Her necklace. I thought she might want you to have it back. No, no, you wear it. You wear it because your soul is going to need some religious saving after everything that you... That you've done! I needed to buy some time to find the murderers without the cops breathing down my neck. I've found them, and I intend to kill them right after I leave here. I trust you support that decision. I suppose it's the only parental decision we'll ever have a chance to make together. I called you Barry! All these years I called you Barry. That's such a stupid fucking name. I bet you got a great big laugh out of that. No. "Oh. If only I could find Barry... "If only, if only Barry knew that we had a child together, "then we could... Then we could be a family." No. You seemed independent. I didn't think you would want me around. Oh, God, oh, God, you spend a couple of decades looking into my window, and you think you fucking know me? I've been putting money aside for Dorothy since she was born. A college fund or something. You can use the money to pay for her funeral expenses if you'd like. I'm going to be sick. Why don't you sit down? No don't touch me. Please don't touch me. Just get the fuck off me, please. Just... Please, don't touch me, please. Come inside. Please! Get out! Get out. I'm sorry, Mary. Get... Get out! There you are, Mr. Sampson. I had this thought. Dorothy hinted to me that she might make a trip to San Francisco. Now I was thinking, the last time I was there, my cell phone had terrible reception, so it's very possible that that could explain why she hasn't answered her phone. Ok, I'll look into it. But I... Would you check that out? I'll look into it. Mr. Sampson, I'm talking to you! Hey, you sell looseys? Just give me a deck of Old Hats. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Holy shit! Did you see that? Did you fucking see that? He's out cold. Yeah. Of course he is. I used a sap. It's leather. If you use a lead pipe or some shit you can fuckin' kill him. Isn't that what we're gonna do anyways? Well, not "we." You. Why me? 'Cause I just fucking sapped him. It's your turn. Come on, Matthew. "Come on, Matthew." This is your shitty mess. It's time to clean it up. Let's just get out of town for a while until it cools off. Why... Why the hell do you think we tracked this guy down? He's a fucking detective and he saw you fleeing the scene. He's gotta go. We can move to another city. Wha... And do what? You're a street level drug dealer. They give that job to fourteen-year-old niggers. What are you gonna do when you can't do that anymore? I mean, you literally can't wipe your own ass. I don't want to go to hell. Well, you're already going to hell for killing that girl. But I didn't... Your after-life is fucked, so you better enjoy your life while you can. And I don't think you're going to enjoy getting your ass torn open in prison. That's why you gotta shoot this fucker before he catches up with us. If this was all a movie I could just give the tape to the cops, and they'd understand. You're dreaming up some director's cut that I haven't seen, because in the movie I saw, you killed that chick. Holy shit! Yeah! You did it! You did it! Oh, shit dude, you're going to hell. Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here. Oh, fuck. Ah.
