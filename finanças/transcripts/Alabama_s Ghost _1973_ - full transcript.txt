introduced into a human body by chinese acupuncture techniques could result in the formation of deadly zeta in his last public statement carter warned that any mortal wired to deadly zeta could be used as a broadcasting catalyst to enslave all humans within the sound of his voice thus becoming an unwitting tool for the most diabolical forces of evil known to man soon afterwards carter vanished
