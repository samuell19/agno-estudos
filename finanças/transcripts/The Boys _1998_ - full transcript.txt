Sorry I'm late. Mum had the car. What about this? Yeah, pick it up. Into a bit of Arts and Crafts, are you? What is it? What do you reckon it is? Looks like a coffee table to me, Brett. You're a bloody genius, Steve. You got it first time. Glenn's got a job cleaning cars. He reckons he can get me one if I want. Yeah? What about me? Yeah, why not? Is he still with that um... ...Janice? Jackie? Jackie-Jackie? Jackie, yeah. Well, you know, don't you? He's moved out. I thought you knew. So, who's this chick you got up the duff? - Nola. - Nola? Nola who? Nola who I met up the pub and got up the duff. That good enough for you? What's she doing living at home? Her old man threw her out. Oh all right. So, has Michelle been misbehaving herself? Not as far as I know. What? You mean you haven't tried to stick it into her yourself? You got a real way with words, haven't you mate? Hey, how come no one came to visit me? Time just gets away so quick, eh? Yeah. Ah, it's not like we didn't think about you while you're in there, mate. Ah four stars, Stevie. - No, we did! We really did! - I really appreciate that. Oh, I thought about you, too. What time are we supposed to be there? About half-past. You've got to do something about your breath, Glenn. Here they are! Hey, peekaboo! Hey! Oh son! Son! How are you, Mum, you old cluck. Oh, you're home! G'day, Brett. Welcome home. G'day, Abo. What are you doing here? - Heard you was getting out today. - Oh right. Oh now look what, you've made me cry. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. Hello, stranger. Jeeze, I hope you kept her warm for me. Oh, now stop it, you two. There's plenty of time for that later. Missed you. Yeah? What are you doing out... ...there. It's too cold. Come in. Did you miss me? Don't. Must have been hard for you love, eh? Yeah. There you go... I made it for you, Mum. I'll go see how the others are, eh? It's lovely, Brett. Hey, Slow-coach. See, I wore it for you: the one you gave me. So... how about playing out some of those sexy dreams you told me you had. Are you still sleeping at your Nana's? I thought you'd be all over me like a rash... not having had it for so long. Oh, there's plenty of time, sweetheart. Is there? Sure. That Glenn and Jackie aren't hanging round all day, are they? Give us more time to do what we want to do, eh? Eh? You know what the best thing about you is? Your tits. Oh, I'm sure I've got something better than that. So, have you been flashing them round? - Hey? What do you mean? Have you been flashing them round? You been showing off your titties to anyone else? No. I heard you did. Who from? It's a lie! I never! That's what I heard! Yeah well, it's bullshit! Who told you that? Is that what Glenn said? He's been trying to put it on me every chance he could get since you've been away. It's... disgusting! Oh, so you've had it locked up and you've thrown away... ...the key, have you? - Yeah. What have you been doing with it? Why are you like this, Brett? Why are you so mean to me? Eh? ...Come on, sweetheart. Lighten up. Eh, eh, eh, I knew you wouldn't do that. I was just testing. Eh, I was just joking. Yeah, funny fucking joke, eh? Hey, who's been in my locker? How would I know? It's been locked, hasn't it? Well, someone's been in it. Is this another one of your jokes? Stevie's been sleeping in here. Ask him. All right... I will. Hey, does anyone know if Glenn's bringing some beer with him? Or should I be going to get some or what? Don't believe nothing you hear, Mum. It's all fucking bullshit! Can we have some back-up? He won't go down. Eric's got him. Got him! Okay. He's down. Well, bring him over to the side, please. Suspect is down and handcuffed, over. Brett! Brett! A six-pack, for fuck's sake! Here I am turning up with a fucking six-pack! How much did it cost? It cost what I said it cost! Don't you fucking trust me now? If you're going to use language I'm going straight to work. - Hello? - Hi, Glenn. Hello. - They here yet? - Yeah. Hi! I just got in. How are you, love? Good, mum. How are you going? Hello, Sandra. Hello, Jackie. Well, where is he? Better go and say hello to the prick. We can't stay long. Hey, Brett! Brett! That's all right. I'll get you a glass. Michelle. Jackie. Come on, will youse?

Come on, Stevie, little Stevie. .. bringing attention to yourself. - Oh, piss off! - Shut up! - Get stuffed! - Squeeze up a bit more! - Okay, have you got us all in? Glenn put your hand down. Hey, don't put your hand up, you dill. Say cheese. Cheese. I hope that's the only trick you learnt in gaol. So do I. Hey, careful with the knife. So, what was it like Brett? I hear Goulburn's not too bad, low security and that. Oh yeah, tell that to the screws. Any big time crims inside with you? Oh yeah, Brett was best mates with Jockey Thompson. They shared a cell together. Oh no! They didn't have you in a cell, did they Brett? What do you think gaol is, Mum? It weren't no holiday camp. Yeah, pity none of youse didn't come to visit. At least Michelle wrote a couple of letters, did you? Oh now, we'll have none of that. This is a celebration. Yeah, you know what it's like, mate. Sometimes things just get away from you. Jeeze, you're a born liar Glenn. You always were and always will be. Now, we'll have none of that. We're all here now, all together at last. What did you go to gaol for? Hello. You must be Nola. Shut up, Nola. No, it's all right, clear. You'll have to excuse her, love. She's only been with us a couple of weeks. Yeah, a couple of weeks too long. No, no, it's all right, Mum. Assault with a deadly weapon. Oh yeah, a screw driver, for fuck's sake. Yeah, and grievous bodily harm. He's the one that should have been charged with grievous bodily harm, that Graham Newman. - Yeah! - Sixteen stitches our Brett got. He nearly lost his spleen. Like, the carving knife was still sticking out of him when they got him to hospital. You were lucky they didn't get you for armed robbery, mate... or you would still have been in. No, I was lucky about nothing. Hey Mum, four eyes is here. Oh Nick, hi. So, two bunting? Yeah, and party hats - three boxes. And three party hats. Right. There's always a party whenever you're here, Nick. Nick, I was wondering... Hey, where's the towels, Mum? In there, love. In that cupboard. Well, are they all there? Were there any defects? Only the one that walked in a couple of minutes ago. I had... twenty I couldn't use. No, I can't see them, Mum. In that cupboard, love. There! Twenty, eh? That's no good. Nick? Thirty the last time. Yeah, forty next time. Pretty soon we'll have nothing but defects. And who's this then? Not little Brett, is it? Where have you been, lad? We missed you. No, he's been away, Nick. Just on holidays. On holidays... ...eh? Well... ...some people have all the luck. I hope you appreciate how hard your mother works for you. - Huh! - Works for you, you mean. Now Nick, you were going to... try and get me some more work. I need more. Yeah, I'll see what I can do. See you, Sandra. Oh yeah, you said that last time. Shit! Oh, it was fucked, mate... It was totally fucked. Something wrong with the prick - fucked in the head or something. Hey, is this the last beer? Hey, talking about fucked in the head. Where did you pick up Nola? I didn't pick her up anywhere. Move over, I want to take a piss. That your kid? How would he know, eh? How would you know how many blokes she been with down the Fife? I'm trying to take a leak, for fuck's sake! Are you going to be a daddy, Stevie? Is that what you're telling us? Shut up, Glenn! You're going to have to give her a D.I.Y., mate. Do-It-Your-fucking-self. Hey, Piss off! - Ah! You grub! - I nearly fucking swallowed it! You fucking grub! Fucking D.I.Y.! Where did you hear that? Hey, you know how long he'd last inside. Three seconds, mate. Three fucking seconds! Pissed all over him fucking self. Oh look at you! What are you, Mr fucking uniform? Oh, you're a real fucking drop-kick, aren't you? - What did I do? - Three seconds, mate. Eh? And they'd have you fucking slammed... ...up against the bar with your fucking head up and your pants down before you know it! The two of youse haven't got a clue, have you? Yeah, well... we weren't the one who went in, were we? Eh, what are you doing hanging around here for eh? Come on and we'll get some beers. Take your car. What? Take whose car? Your car. Hey, we're going out to get some grog, all right? Oh no, the tandoori will be ready soon. Oh, all right. Get us a bottle of Irish Cream, will you Brett? Yeah, rightio. Here, I'll get you some money. No, it's all right, Mum. - Have you got any money? - No. Then you'd better go get some. Whoah, a big blue car. When did they pick up this one? Hey Jackie, give us some money, will you, and we'll go and get some beers. We're supposed to be at work, Glenn, five minutes ago. Yeah, we're going to get there. We're just going to have one beer and then we'll go. We're going to have one more drink, and we'll go straight to work, all right? Okay? All right? What are you doing? Well, give us your keys. I'm driving. Oh no way, Brett. No, no, not with the insurance, mate! Hey, give me the fucking keys! You're in the back, Glenn! Hey, slow down, will you Brett? - No, I'm just saying. - Hey, shut up! ...I'm driving, all right? You know what I learnt in Goulburn? Shit, I learnt a lot. I learnt to keep my mouth shut and not be a smart-arse. You know the other thing I learnt? I learnt that if you don't hang together, you hang separate. That's something the two of youse have got to learn. We know that, Brett. We know... Oh you're going to fuck me, Stevie, you know that? You're going to fuck me 'cause you're such a piss weak little bastard! There's cameras, Brett! - I wouldn't do it to you, mate! - Yes, you will. I know you! - No, I wouldn't! Brett, I don't... want to get booked, all right? It's two hundred bucks! Oh fuck! G'day, Graham. G'day, Brett... Feeding time at the zoo, mate? No, I just got out. Right... I can see that. Gee, you must have really liked it to be angling to get back in so quickly. It was a ripper, mate. A real fucking ripper! G'day, Sparrow. What are you doing here, Sprague? Why don't you fuck off? - Fucking bastard! - Stevie! Stevie! Fuck off, Sparrow! Don't touch me! Hey, you still got that twelve inch carving knife under the counter there? Yeah. Do you want to have another look at it, do you? Yeah, how about having a look at that, eh? Oh shit, mate, that must have hurt. Come on, Brett. Lets just fucking get out of here Mate. I thought about you a lot while I was away, Graham. Yeah well, you know something, Brett? ...I didn't think about you at all. And you know what I thought about most? No, what did you think about? You're such a shit-brain, you'd look a whole lot better with your head hanging out of your arse. Come on, Brett, let's just fucking get out of here, mate! Hey Graham, here's some of your chinko friends. Pretty good eh? Chin-chin-Chinaman. Ah, you're pathetic, Brett! Yeah, you owe me, Newman! You fucking owe me! What the fuck are you doing, Brett? Do you want to get us busted? Mate, I thought we were getting some beer. Yeah well, we're not getting it here. Yeah, no, undesirables here. Yeah, nice car, Glenn. Who chose the colour? - She did. - Yeah, thought so. Chin-chin Chinaman. Have you got any idea of what time it is? We went down the bottle shop to get some beer? What's the big deal? We were supposed to be there an hour ago, Glenn! Oh, for fuck's sake! What? You don't want your job? You don't want your job? Look, I told you. We're going to have one drink with my fucking brothers! Oh yeah, one drink! Yeah! I just want to sort something out with Brett, all right? - There you go. Hey Mum, have you ever been to India? - No. Well, you'd better get that into you, eh? Hey Stevie, you got the munchies yet, mate? Piss off, Michelle. Hey Jackie, that's a nice car you've got. All right, now, did everyone get a plate? Thanks, Brett. Yeah, it's a Vienta, isn't it? The Big V. Well, what are you all waiting for? - Well, that's what they call it. What are you waiting for? Bog in! So, why do you reckon they call it that, Jackie: The Big V? She doesn't know anything about cars, Brett. I guess you could really say I bought it. But I paid for it. Yeah, you paid for it, but I bought it. No, Glenn. I paid for it. You put the deposit down, that's all. And I'd like to know where you got that from as well. No-no, but Jackie, the Big V... ...I mean that's a bit bloody rude, isn't it? Oh, only if you've got a dirty mind. Now, who wants what. Look, there's rice, there's salad... No, no, mum, the Big V you know what that means, don't you? Oh, stop acting the goat. Someone go and call Nola... No, no, mum, the Big V. That's what Jackie's been giving us the whole morning. Don't talk nonsense. Haven't you? We're not good enough for the likes of you, are we? Me and me brothers? No one said anything of the sort. That's not what I said. No, mate, don't. Well, why not? It's the truth, isn't it? Stop him, Glenn. Eh? Isn't that what she said? Can't stay here long, "Got to go to work." Well, she didn't mean that. Now tomatoes? Do you want tomatoes? Well, we do. I mean, some people have work to do. Oh what? ...We're just lousy, no good bludgers, are we? That's what you think, isn't it? That's a terrible thing to say, Brett. Glenn, do you intend to allow... ...your brother to insult me in this way? Yes, do you... ...Glenn? Come on, mate, let's just leave it and have some lunch, huh? Oh yes, I see. Yes, I see. Everyone's got to be careful not to offend poor, little Brett. - Careful what you say. - Jack. Well, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Oh no they can just... ...go to hell because the only person that counts around here is Brett. What do you mean? Let me tell you what I mean. You're a Pig! Oh fuck! And we all felt a hell of a lot safer when you were locked up in gaol. That's not true, Brett. Hey, it's the cops. What do they want? - No, don't let them in... - Jackie don't! They haven't got a warrant. And I don't know why they let you out. 'Cause you haven't learnt a thing the whole time you were away. What do you want? Mrs Sprague? What do you want? We just want to talk to your son, Mrs Sprague. Well, he doesn't want to talk to you. Why can't you leave him alone. He only got out this morning. Is he here? No, he's not. No, it's all right, Mum. No, it's not all right. Why do they keep picking on you for? I mean, why aren't you out chasing real criminals? Did you go down to the Fife and Drum drive-in this morning, Brett? Yeah, of course I did, Maguire. What's it to you? Would you mind telling me why? Well, what do you reckon? It's a bottle shop, isn't it? Why don't you go back inside, Mrs Sprague? No, I'm staying here. All right. We received a complaint that you made certain threatening statements to Mr Graham Newman while you were there: Is that true? No. No, it's not. It is a condition of your parole that you go nowhere near the vicinity of the Fife and Drum hotel... ...that you do not request service there, you do not approach or come within 300 metres of Graham Newman for the remaining period of your sentence. Or you go back to gaol, Brett. - Do you understand that, Brett? - Yeah. Good. Who's your parole officer? I don't know. I've got it on a piece of paper in there. Okay, then you contact your parole officer today, and he'll explain your obligations under the Early Release Scheme. Will you do that? Yeah, righto. You do it. I'll make sure he does. Or I'll take you in. Yeah, righto. I'll make sure he does, officer. All right, then. Mrs Sprague. Thank you, officer. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What did you go down there for? I just wanted some grog. Oh, don't lie to me. You wanted to show off again, didn't you? Oh give it a break, Mum! You can't leave it alone, can you? It's a wonder he didn't stab you again. Jackie! The car! The fucking car! Jackie! Fucking bitch! Hello. Are you the mother of those boys that went to gaol? Eh? You're a fucking empty slut. Eh? You are. You're a fucking empty slut, and I'll tell you. I'm fucking ringing up just to fucking give you some information that.. fucking the media and the police wouldn't give out about what your... ...about what your fucking arseholes fucking did to that girl, right? You should fucking know, because you're their fucking mother, right? So, I'll give you the fucking information, you fucking slut. I brung some groceries, love. What? Hey, you been in my locker? No. Where's my stuff? What stuff? What fucking stuff do you think? What you had a stash in your locker all this time? Well, I thought I did. I don't know where it is. I didn't even know you had any. You're a fucking liar. ...it comes with a stainless steel lid as well. It has a nice, tight fit... ...on the saucepan. Also, what's nice is that you have control over your air-vent and of course, your... Can you believe it? That fucking bitch, she took the car. Eh, you got yourself in too deep, too fucking fast, mate. You dishing out marriage guidance now, Brett? Hey piss off, Michelle. Oh... what are the boys doing? Whingeing. As usual. Oh god! It doesn't matter how hard I try, it always... ends up a bloody mess. I think... What's that, love? I think I might go. Go? Where? I think I might go away, you know, somewhere else? What? Leave, you mean? Yeah. Oh, I don't know. Maybe Stevie could give me a lift somewhere. Yeah, I'm sure he could. Ah... have you told him yet? Where are you going to go? I've got a friend. Mmm? Where? Stevie, come in here. What are you going to do? You got any money? No. I'm watching TV. Come in here! Well, what are you going to do if you haven't got any money. I don't know! Yeah? What? Nola's leaving. Good. What do you mean, good? She's your girlfriend. Says who? I never asked her. She's your girlfriend because you got her pregnant. Oh yeah prove it. You ask her what she's been up to with the other blokes, then. What other blokes? - You had other blokes, Nola? - No. No it's bullshit, Mum. You ask her how many blokes she's been down the Fife and Drum with. Is that true, Nola? Come off it, Sandra. He's been rooting around for so... ...fucking long it's a wonder he hasn't got a tribe of them. Oh fucking bullshit! ...Let me handle it. All I want to do is get away. Hey? Hey, what's going on here? Will you tell your brother to get his shit together? This poor kid's so fucking frightened, she'd rather spend the night at the bus station than hang... ...around here another five minutes. I never did anything. Eh... Eh, sweetheart, what's wrong? What's wrong? That's what you should be doing! All I want to do is get away. Eh, no one's getting away. Look, you're one of us now. Look, you're carrying my mum's first grandchild. Yeah. I'm scared. There's no reason to be scared. Look, I'd do anything to protect you. Who are you trying to bullshit, Brett? What are you fucking doing? Hey shut up. You don't know what you're talking about. Hey... There you go. You see, this is what it's going to be like, now. Hey? This is what it's going to be like. But I'm scared. There you are. Hey? All right? Yeah? Yeah? Good Boy. Oi! What was that crap you were going on about before? "I'd do anything to protect the family. What the fuck is that?" Well, I would. What family? Nola? Just 'cause she's having a kid doesn't make her family. So... I'd protect you as well. From what? Now, just leave us alone for a tick, would you Michelle? Please? What's wrong with you, Brett? You haven't said a word to me since you got home. Look, I'm not going to stand in the hallway and discuss these things with you all right? Discuss what? Oh what do you reckon? I just spent a year inside and you don't think there's nothing to discuss? It was your own bloody fault, wasn't it? You must have been... out of your head to do what you did. What was it? Were you stoned? No, I wasn't stoned. Well, what then? Are you just stupid? You thought you could walk into the local bottle-o with a screwdriver and knock it over. Is that it? Hey, why don't you go and ask Graham Newman what happened? Look, I hope you're just pissed, Brett, because if you're not, you're going straight back to where you came from. Well, if I am... ...you'll miss the hard cock I've got saved up for you. I don't reckon you've got it in you. What would you know, eh? What would you know about anything? ...and now Timmy Brasher gets gingerly to his feet... ...now they spin it out the Tigers' backline... ...the inside pass to Sironen - Sironen busts through one tackle... ...Toovey cuts him down and Sironen has deadset not moved! Let's go play some pool or something, eh? Don't feel like dropping in on Newman again? Oh fuck off! Want a durrey? No, I gave up. Then, what's that in your pocket? What, this? That's me pride, mate. Oh... Oh, Michelle. I was just looking at me fan. It's the only thing he ever gave me. Funny that, isn't it? They all said they loved me, but they left me. You shouldn't leave anything you love. You know what they're up to, don't you? I might go to work. It's not too late. Yeah, bullshit. If shitface here doesn't know where my stuff is, then you must. What stuff? Oh, what stuff do you reckon? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Don't be such a drama queen, Michelle! You know what they're like. What harm are they doing? Are you frightened of them or something? Frightened of them? Hey, put on some music. We don't have any. Put on a record or something. It's broke. Well, put on the radio, for fuck's sake! I want to talk to youse without fucking big ears listening to everything we say. You are, aren't you? You're frightened of them. Yeah, where is it? Where's me stuff? What stuff? The fucking rock! The rock? What the... you mean, the shit we were selling down the Fife? I thought you sold it. No, no, the stuff we had left. What? You had some, did you? Yeah. What? You kept some? You fucking kept some! You rip-off mongrel... You told us you sold it all. Well, where's the rest of it then? Oh, you're good, mate. You're real fucking good. Can you believe this prick? What are they going to do? Are they going to let off a bomb? There are worse things in this world, Michelle, than my boys. That's not what I'm talking about. Well, you try living here and keeping a lid on things! You try it! We had a fucking good business going down there at the Fife, eh? But we didn't have the green light from Newman, did we? And when some fuck-head here opens up his trap... Give us a break, mate. Oh, that's when the fucking slammer came down, didn't it? And old Brett-boy walks straight into it. It wasn't a fucking armed hold-up, it was a fucking set-up. I mean, Newman waiting there with a fucking knife to stick in me. Hey, that was it for me, wasn't it Stevie? I still don't know how Newman found out. I'll tell you how he found out. You had your fucking mouth open so wide he'd have to be deaf not to hear. It's not the way it happened, Brett. Oh, shut up, you fuck-head. No, you listen to me! It's all right for you lot to come marching in here telling me what I should do. I'm not fucking telling... Listen, I'm the one who's stuck with it! Right, love? Not you! Yeah well, they are yours, aren't they? Yeah, they're mine! They're mine! They're mine, Michelle, and I love them. Then, chain them up. What did you fucking say? I'm not chaining anything up. They're not dogs. But, I'll tell you one thing. As long as they're under this roof, they'll do as they're told. All right! All right! Let's get a bit of order in this place. Let's start cleaning up. Eh? No cleaning. Hey Brett, Brett! Come on, let's start cleaning up, eh? Come on, I'm not talking to a... Stop it! Hey, give us a dance, Mum! Give us a dance! Mum-mum-mum. Give us a dance, Mum! Oh two men fighting over me! I don't think I've had... Come on! Head bang! Head bang! Head bang! Head bang! Head bang! How do you like your dance, Mum? Get your hands off her, you mongrel! Well, I can't dance with the two of youse at once. - Oh, come on, Mum. - Get out of it! Hey! Oh, you've taken a few pages out of Jackie's book, have you? What did they do to you in there? Give you a fucking lobotomy or something? Where are you at? Where's your fucking head at? Oh, where's me head at? Oh... Moons Of Infinity. Oh, save your science fiction fucking bullshit... ...You're a fucking idiot! Hey, I don't like people walking away from me. Listen, dickhead, you might think you're King of the fucking universe slumming it down here with the mortals, but from what I've just seen... ...you're just a bunch of fucking losers, same as everybody else. Eh, whose cock you been sucking? Grow up! Hey, you know what your Mum reckons? She reckons you're all such mental spastics that the world needs to be protected from you. What makes you think she's wrong? Fuck off! I want it, Michelle. What? Now? Oh, you're a real... ...fucking Casanova, aren't you? Are you going to give it to me? Well, where do you want it? Here on the kitchen table... where your Mum will find us? Or up against the fridge? No, no, no. I know. How about the laundry, eh? Somewhere real dirty. With cockroach shit and rat poison and stuff, eh - how about that? Sure - whatever you like. All right - come on. Yeah, just give us a tick. Here they are! My tits! This is what you wanted isn't it? Yeah, just give us a tick, will you? Well, where is it? Where's this fucking cock you've been going on about? Hey, shut up! Just get out of me hair! You can't do it, can you? You took it up the arse, didn't you? What did you say? You took it up the arse. Yeah? - I did fuck someone else. - Yeah? Oh fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! God, I hate you, you prick! I fucking hate you! Oh no, not me face! I knew you'd fucked someone. I wouldn't touch you in a million years, you slag. No, you're never going to get the chance, you fuck! I never want to see you again! Hey! Why don't you fuck off! Go on, fuck off! Where's Michelle? Oh, I think she had to go to the little girls' room. Hello? G'day, Mum. How are you? Are you all right? Good. Look, you got to come, okay? And bring Michelle with you. Oh, I don't think... I don't know... Michelle doesn't want to see... any of us, Brett. Oh, so I am going to go down for something that someone else did? Look, she's... she's my one hope, Mum. She knows where I was that night. Now, you've got to come, okay? And make sure you bring Michelle with you. Okay, I'll try. Bye. Rightio, see you. Are you there, Michelle? I know you're there, Michelle. Michelle... I know what he done to you. Michelle. I know you're there. Michelle! Here Nola, come and have your soup, love. I'm not hungry. No, come on. It will do you good. Come on, love. Ah, this is the life, eh? Yeah, some fucking life. Jeeze, I'm hungry. Hey Mum, can you get us some food? Don't suppose I've got a job now, anyway. Do you reckon I should give them a call? Will you shut up about that? Hey, how much are they paying you? Oh, come on Brett, don't make fun of us. No, no, I'm not making fun of you. How much are they paying you? Three twenty. Three twenty a week for wearing that? Yeah, three twenty a week. What's wrong with that? It's good money. Hey, you know what the basic wage is? No, what? Hey! Hey, do you? Oh look, get fucked, Brett! It's my money. I'm earning it. Four hundred and sixty nine bucks. Bullshit! Four hundred and sixty nine bucks. Dead set. That's fucking bullshit, mate. I don't believe you! Oh well, have a look - go and have... a look at it up in the papers. Oh yeah, they fiddle with the figures. Mate, you'd think everyone was a bloody millionaire. Well, these are just the sausages you didn't eat. You want me to do the steaks? I don't know anyone on that sort of money. Yeah, 'cause... that's cause you don't know anyone. 'Cause if you did you'd know you were getting screwed stupid. And the ones screwing you the most are the ones saying they only want to help. You're talking about Jackie, aren't you mate? Oh fucking Jackie! Listen, don't you say nothing about Jackie, all right? She's the best fucking thing... Give us a break, Glenn? You sound like a fucking idiot... ...when he comes out with crap like that. So, what should we be doing, Brett? Going to gaol with you, you mean? Is that how we're going to sort out our future, is it? Oh what fucking future, Glenn? This is it, mate! This is the fucking future! What do you think, some man's going to pop out and fucking plop you... ...down in one of those places you see on TV? No mate, I'm going to do it myself. You see, Jackie and me, we got plans. Fucking Jackie! Yeah... fucking Jackie's the one that... Don't you say nothing about Jackie, mate! Don't you fucking say nothing about her! Fucking Jackie's the one who got you the underpaid job. That's fucking bullshit, mate! That's not how much people get paid! Hey, I'm sorry, mate. It is. Fucking Jackie's the one that's been. You see, Jackie and me, we got plans. You want to know why, mate? Because she hasn't got a fucking choice. No one in this fucking world's got a choice... they're all out there trying to do it to everyone else. Like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers? Yeah. Jeeze you're a fucking idiot, sometimes. There's only one way out. Kill them with pitchforks. No, mate... you fucking do what they're trying to do. You fucking do it to them. You get him off the grog. Get him off the grog if it's the last thing you do. And that other stuff. What the fuck...? What is it this time? Afternoon, Mrs Sprague. Is everything all right? It would be if you didn't keep disturbing things. My name is Sprague. We had a report of a woman screaming. Do you mind if we look inside? Yeah, we do. What's going on in there, Brett? None of your business. Do you want to step aside, Brett? No thanks, I like it right where I am. I don't need to be nice about this, Brett. Eh, eh, no one's asking you to, Cuntstable. How many women in the house, Mrs Sprague? You don't have to answer, Mum. Don't say nothing to them. There's nothing you can do, is there? 'Cause a man's home is his castle, isn't that right? Is this your home, Mrs Sprague? Who pays the rent? Don't answer him, Mum. You don't have to say nothing. Look, we've been told a disturbance has taken place in the house. No, there hasn't been any disturbance. Is there somebody injured inside, Mrs Sprague? Neighbours have complained of loud noises coming from... Oh, get a warrant! And women screaming! Where's Michelle? I don't know. Where is she? Don't look at me! Look at the three of you, you bloody lazy load of... What have you fucking done with her? Have you hurt her? Hey, I didn't touch her. Maybe she's gone down the shop to get some fags. Get up! Clean yourselves up! Just do something, will you? Oh Jesus! Do what? I don't care! Just do something with your bloody selves! Get out of the house! Oh great, now she's chucking us out of the house!

I'm so glad to see you. How did you get off work? What did he give you that for? Craig said it was so important for him to be able to reach me he gave me his mobile... ...for the afternoon. Glenn, I've got something really important I want to say to you. Yeah, what? Listen to me, you stupid arsehole! Do you want to save our relationship, or not? Save our relationship? 'Course I do. Well, you listen to me. Because I've been thinking about us... ...and the way you've been treating me... ...and I just don't know if I want you living with me any more. Oh Jeeze... Come on, Jack. Come on, Jack. Don't cry. Craig says I'm too good for you. That's what he says. Oh yeah, that's what fucking Craig says. And what Mum says and what everyone says. But I believe in you, Glenn. And I really, really want this to work. Fuck's sake! So do I, Jack. I really want it to fucking work! Then, there's one thing I want you to do for me. Anything! Just tell me!
