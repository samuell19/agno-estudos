Now boarding for Bastrop, Smithville... West Point, La Grange, Ellinger, Columbus, Sealy, Brookshire... - Katy and Houston. All aboard, please. Man, I just had the weirdest dream back on the bus there. Do you ever have those dreams that are just completely real? I mean, they're so vivid, it's just like completely real. It's like there's always something bizarre going on in those. I have one about every two years or something. I always remember 'em really good. It's like there's always someone getting run over or something really weird. Uh, one time I had lunch with Tolstoy. Another time I was a roadie for Frank Zappa. Anyway. So this dream I just had, it was just like that... except instead of anything bizarre going on... I mean, there was nothing going on at all. Man. It was like The Omega Man. There was just nobody around. I was just traveling around... you know, staring out the windows of buses and trains and cars, you know. When I was at home, I was, like, flipping through the TV stations endlessly, reading. I mean, how many dreams do you have where you read in a dream? Wait. Man, there was this book I just read on the bus - You know, it was my dream, so I guess I wrote it or something. But, uh, man, it was bizarre. It was like, uh... the premise for this whole book... was that every thought you have creates its own reality, you know? It's like every choice or decision you make... the thing you choose not to do... fractions off and becomes its own reality, you know... and just goes on from there forever. I mean, it's like... uh, you know, in the Wizard of Oz... when Dorothy meets the Scarecrow and they do that little dance at that crossroads... and they think about going all those directions... then they end up going in that one direction. I mean, all those other directions, just because they thought about it... became separate realities. They just went on from there and lived the rest of their life. I mean, entirely different movies, but we'll never see it... because, you know, we're kind of trapped in this one reality restriction type of thing. Another example would be like back there at the bus station. As I got off the bus, the thought crossed my mind... you know, just for a second, about not taking a cab at all. But, you know, like maybe walking, or bummin' a ride or something like that. I'm kind of broke right now. I should've done that probably. But, uh, just 'cause that thought crossed my mind... there now exists at this very second... a whole 'nother reality where I'm at the bus station... and you're probably giving someone else a ride, you know? I mean, and that reality thinks of itself as this - it thinks of itself as the only reality, you know. I mean, at this very second, I'm in that - I'm back at the bus station just hangin' out, you know... probably thumbin' through a paper. You know, probably goin' up to a pay phone. Say this beautiful woman just comes up to me, just starts talking to me, you know? Uh, she ends up offering me a ride, you know. We're hitting it off. Go play a little pinball. And we go back to her apartment, I mean, she has this great apartment. I move in with her, you know. Say I have a dream some night... that I'm with some strange woman I've never met... or I'm living at some place I've never seen before. See, that's just a momentary glimpse into this other reality... that was all created back there at the bus station. You know, shoot. And then, you know... I could have a dream from that reality into this one... that, like, this is my dream from that reality. Of course, that's kind of like that dream I just had on the bus, you know. The whole cycle type of thing. Man, shit. I should've stayed at the bus station. Don't touch her. Need to call the police. Get an ambulance. Check that bag for some I.D. You better call the family. - Don't touch her! - I've gotta get the bag. Hurry. I'll stay. Hurry. What in the hell? - What happened? What's going on? - Accident. Everything's under control. Well, good. So you don't need me? - No, I don't think so. - Okay. Look, can I help you out? Do you need a ride anywhere or anything? No, I don't think so. Tell you what. Take my card. Give me a call. I wish I could stay and help, but I gotta go, really. But call me. I'd like to hear from you. I mean it. Whose body is this? - Here, call this guy. - These your groceries, lady? Hello? Uh, yes, it is. This is her son. She's not here right now. I mean, I don't think she's up yet. Oh, drag. Anybody get a licence plate number or anything? Were there any witnesses? Okay, so the police have been notified. Okay, uh, good. Well, let me know if you need me for anything. Uh, thanks for calling. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you for calling. Thank you. - Officer Bozzio and Love with the police department. - Hello, it's me. - What happened? - I don't know. Looks like some guy, uh, ran over his mother. ? It's so personal ? ? That no one ? ? No one in their right mind ? ? Would touch him with a ten-foot pole ? ? With a six-foot pole With a six-inch pole ? ? Well, maybe a six-inch ? ? That's a disturbed young man with a tan ? ? And problems so deep ? ? And so personal torturing himself? ? With a tan and so personal ? ? Past the Conoco, the Abel's ? ? Who's that man with a tan ? ? That's a disturbed young man with a tan ?? [Man] "Number three: opportunistic celibacy. "Number four: renunciation of all human endeavor. "A nd the fifth and final pillar of euphoria: "a full-circle, aesthetic reevaluation. "My current response to every worldwide or personal tragedy is: "It's disgusting. I love it. I hope it gets even worse." Okay. I'm Dostoyevsky. You're Anna. We're writing The Gambler. Take my dictation. Who's ever written the great work about the immense effort required... in order not to create? Intensity without mastery. The obsessiveness of the utterly passive. And could it be that in this passivity... - I shall find my freedom? - Well, I'm headin' over there. Hey, man. What are you doing? You're supposed to be getting this down. It was pretty good there. - You seen Gary around? - No. - Does he still live in the same place? - I told you. No one's seen him for months. - Well, later. - What was that obsessiveness line again? - Obsessiveness without personality? - What are you talking about? Excuse me. Say, pal! Did I overhear you say you got a friend that's missing? Well, I doubt he's missing. He's just not around. Oh, yeah, well. I've been reading in the World Weekly News. Just a while ago there was a guy out on the street. He's found wandering around, didn't know who he was, where he came from. He's perfectly healthy, but he's a complete amnesiac, you know. A lot of people like that found, uh, just wandering around lately. You know, no history, no nothing. - It's weird, huh? - Yeah. You know about the suppressed transmission, of course? - Mm-mmm. - No? Oh, well. This is the 20th anniversary of the moon walk, you know. And way back when they're giving us that "One giant step for mankind" bit... another astronaut's in the background yelling his fool head off... saying, " Oh, my God. What's that over in the crater? What the hell is that?" Well, NASA cuts him off just like that. But those of us with the right kind of radios, you know what I mean? Yeah, we got enough of it. The gist of it was... there's a giant spacecraft over in the other crater, looking at them. That's right. Oh, it all begins to leak out then... that the space program's just one giant big cover-up. It's a covert operation between the United States government and the Soviet Union. It's been going on for over 30 years. We've been on the moon since the '50s. You wanna know how we got there, right? I'll tell you. Anti-grav drive. Anti-gravity technology. We stole it from the Nazis after the end of World War II. It's perfectly obvious. And you know, I was watching this Late, Late Show. A lot of truth in the Late, Late Show. You know, they slip it through there, they figure nobody's watching, but - Anyway, there's this sci-fi movie called Alternative Three. And, uh, it's about kidnapping people, using a little psycho-surgery on them... and, uh, turn them into zombies. And making them colonize the moon and Mars. Funny, huh? Except it's absolutely true, all of it. We've been on Mars since '62. It was May 22nd. That's a very important date for you to remember, pal. - Yeah, that's my birthday. - Right. So, see... the reason we're up there covertly is because of the greenhouse effect. It all ties in. Yeah, greenhouse effect. By the way, they discovered that in the '40s. You can ask yourself what they've been doing sitting on their ass for 49 years, huh? While we're out here with some serious social diseases and everything else. Oh, never mind that. Everybody says... "Greenhouse effect. A hundred years from now. Oh, I'll be long dead, gone and out of here." Not so, my friend. Not so. The government's sitting on the fact that it's 10-20 years maximum. It's getting hotter, don't you think? Yeah, it's not even summer yet. Yeah, and when the polar ice caps begin to melt... it's not gonna take a certified genius to understand that we're in serious global confusion. I mean, really, we're in massive mainline ecological chaos. Anyway, it's happening even as we speak. So, I'll tell you what they've already done. They've colonized outer space. Oh, they couldn't colonize everybody. No, no. That would be global bankruptcy. We couldn't beat the greenhouse effect anyway. This secret group, you know, the group that's in charge of the government - Oh, yeah. They're gonna get boosted off this rock before it melts. And the rest of us, what do they care? We're gonna be left here to fry. By the way, there's something you should know. You see, this entire operation's being funded... by the profits from the Medell?n drug cartel. And they're specifically set up by the C.I. A... to handle large sums of money being funneled into this project. Keep it under your hat. [Sighs] The people they need, like scientists. You heard about that? All the missing scientists around the world, and those that are mysteriously dying... that's all part of the recruiting process. I really hope your friend is not, well - Well, they need a lot of lackeys to do the labor though. So they'll be looking for ordinary guys. You know, just like you and me. Yeah, they need those to kind of colonize things. You know, they do a little psycho-surgery on us, a little liquid lobotomy here. Well. And I know this for a fact. They got this drug down in Guatemala in the rain forest. Why do you think the C.I.A.'s down there hacking the hell out of that forest, huh? Make sense? Sure it does. Yeah, this drug takes away your long-term memory... leaves your short-term memory, so there you are. You got people that don't know who they are, where they came from... but you tell them to do something, and they do it. They can follow instructions. Perfect employees. - Sounds like most people I know. - So. They must like children too, because... the statistics of the F.B.I. since 1980... said that 350,000 children are just missing. They disappeared. There are not that many perverts around. You know the worst thing about this, pal? Is that you're in close proximity to all this. You know, I mean, Houston's right down the road. You know, the main headquarters. NASA. Sure, in the main headquarters, around the world... All right, look. I gotta go see this friend of mine, okay? - Yeah, right in here. - Is this it? Okay. Anyway, look, pal. It's been nice talking to you. I really hope your friend isn't one of them already. - I'm sure he's not. - Yeah, well. - I just thought you had the right to know. - Thanks. Tell you what, listen. I'm gonna stick around outside, just for a little while... kind of make sure everything's okay. You know, make sure we weren't followed. Have a nice day. - Hi, how you doing? - All right. - How's it going? - Fine. - Matter of fact, where are you going? - Going home. Oh, you live here. Okay, sure. Well. Just a little security check. There've been some people missing. Nothing to worry about, pal. Okay, you gotta go. I mean, you're in a hurry. That makes perfect sense. Things are speeding up here at the end. Gotcha. What a day, what a day. The thing is, the media's trying to hold up this whole one-party, two-faction system... by telling you that George Bush got this mandate with 54% of the vote. And thatjust doesn't take into account the whole population of the country. They say that 50.3%, in the media... they say 50.3% of the eligible population participated in the '88 election. But I think the figure's a hell of a lot lower than that. You gotta consider. Prisoners. We got more people incarcerated in this country... than any other country in Western history. Noncitizens, the underage, the overage, people too old to get to the polls. People out in rural areas. People who don't have addresses. I mean, to be conservative, the figure's more like 35%. So Bush got 54% of 35%. What's that, 18%? Maybe 18% of the people in this country support him. That's nothing. That's nothing. That's not a mandate. - The people in Nazi Germany had- - You guys done male bonding yet? Nazi Germany in 1932, the Nazis had maybe 34-38%. And somebody like Pinochet who's already out of there back in Chile... that guy's got maybe 34-43% of the vote. So 18% is nothing. Itjust seems like one day it's gonna dawn on everybody... that this large nonvoting majority has been winning every election... for the past three decades. And the people who win these elections are gonna be too ashamed... or better yet, too afraid to even take power at all. Oh, hey. Ow, man. - Uh, Paul's moved, man. - Where did he go? I don't know. It's like he split, man. He's like - He disappeared. Nobody knows where he is. But, uh, his room is, like, totally empty. It's got everything moved out. And on the floor there's these postcards just sitting there. Sitting there right in the middle. It's really bizarre. Why don't you come look? It's really weird. So where you getting all these statistics from anyway? Dallas Morning News, man. You ought to read it for a change. See, he's gone. All his stuff's gone. - Strange. - He's a strange guy. - What do we have here? - Those are the cards he left. There's writing on the back of them. They're numbered. It's like a little story or something. "Juan Apagato spends a lot of time wandering around town. "He tried college for a while, but it consumed too much time. "So now he's looking for a job that doesn't involve much work. "He rents a room in a large house and rarely sees the people he lives with. "One is called Frank something, and he thinks there are some more... but he can't be sure." I guess that means all of us. "He comes from a light blue-collar family. "He doesn't see his parents much anymore. "He quit going to visit when they quit sending him money. One of his grandparents died last month, but he can't remember which." It's Uncle Fester. "Last summer he thought about sticking his index finger in a fan. "Someone told him his fingerprints are unique, and he believes... "there's too much direct evidence against uniqueness. "He thinks that differences are minor compared to the similarities. "All his days are about the same. "He wakes up at 11:00 or 12:00... "eats cereal or toast, reads the newspaper... "looks out the front door, takes a walk... "goes to a movie matinee, listens to the radio... "watches sitcom reruns till 1:00... "and usually falls asleep about 2:00. He likes to sleep. Sometimes he has good dreams." It's the finale. "Watch for the next episode: "Juan joins up with an emerging European terrorist organization... and soon returns to the U.S. with a supply of homemade nuclear weapons." Huh. That's interesting. Just a second. - Hi. - Hey, guy. - Hi. What's going on? - Paul moved out, man. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, took all his stuff, just left these cards here. - Can I have his room? - Sure, why not? Cool. Hey, where you headed? Oh, I got some band practice in about five hours... so I figured I'd mosey on out. - Okay. - See you. Stephanie? - Oh, hi. - Hi. Wow. I haven't seen you around in a long time. Yeah, I just got back about a week ago. - Yeah? From where? - Dallas. Dallas? Man. What were you doing up there? Hanging out, resting. I was in the hospital for a while. - Wow. - It was really awful. - Yeah? - Yeah. It was awful. Your parents, probably? - Yeah, you could say they put me there. - Yeah. So what are you up to? Same old, same old. Just... Iollygagging around. Still unemployed. Uh, I'm in this band. Well, the one I was in before, but now we've changed our name. ? Ta-da ?? We're The Ultimate Losers now. And, uh, the singer is still a jerk. And, uh, well. We're playing this Friday. If you wanna come, I can put you on the list. I'm sleeping a lot, you know. - Yo, hey, dude. - Hey. Man, I am freaking out so severely. Did you hear what happened on the freeway? You didn't see the local news today? Oh, it's beautiful. Man, this old man driving to town from San Antonio... like this old man about 40 or 50 years old... goin' about a hundred miles an hour down the freeway... waving a gun at people, laughing. Like, doin' fuckin' chicken squawks at people out the window... and showing them his gun and going like - Things like that. People were freaked. They didn't know if he was just a lunatic, you know... with, like a squirt gun or what. And then, check it out, the guy started firing on the freeway... randomly through his windows. He shot one bullet up at the roof of his car... and it just ricocheted around inside with him for a while. He was, like, out of his mind. Everybody tried to get off the freeway. Some chick who had a bullet lodged in her ponytail... called the pigs in San Marcos. And they had six or seven pig cars chasing him into the south side of town. He was still swingin' the gun around, man, and laughing. He fuckin' laughed all the way. Finally his car spun out and slammed into the grassy knoll... you know, the median. As soon as his car came to a halt, man... he just put the gun to his head and blammo. Offed himself, man. Blew himself away right there. It's like, I don't know... he had had enough, enough. - It's like - - Do you know Stephanie? Oh, yeah. I thought I heard that you were in "Timberlawn." - I got back about a week ago. - All right, cool. Oh, yeah. I know what I gotta show you guys. This -This will blow your gourd. I have this friend, all right, she's a gynecologist in Hollywood. And she scored this for me from the lab where she works. It's a Madonna pap smear. I know it's kind of cloudy, but it's a Madonna pap smear. It's got "Ciccone" on the top. That's like a medical label. "Ciccone." Check it out. I know it's kind of disgusting... but it's like, it's sort of... like getting down to the real Madonna. I don't know if you can see it now. I freaked out when it came in the mail. It had two pubic hairs in it, and I showed it to this asshole... and he stole one of them. But if you look real close, you can see it's still in there. It's about as black as they come. Do you think maybe, uh... you'd be interested in buying something like this? It's like a high-dollar item. It's, you know, one of a kind. It's like chance of a lifetime. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm pretty broke, though. What about you? Do you think you know anyone who might be - I mean, it's a little bit getting closer to the rock god herself... than just a poster. No? All right. You guys' loss. I thought I could, you know, maybe swing a bargain. - Sorry. - All right. Can't blame me. I tried. It's a material world and I'm a material girl. I better cruise. I gotta check this guy Chico on the east side. He's real interested in this. - All right. - Hey, how's your band going anyway? What is it? Beautiful Loser? - Yeah, it's The Ultimate... - All right. Check you later. Losers. So, yeah, Friday night. Guest list? Oh, yeah. That might be all right. Okay. - Well. - I'll see you Friday. All right, yeah. Everybody's running around here wondering when the bombs are gonna fall, and the fact of the matter is that the bombs have already fallen. People are running around here dwelling in the 11 th-hour concept... and it's well afternoon. I mean, our thought processes have been totally subverted... by the concepts these people lay before us. By the church, the schools and the media right now. I mean, it's almost impossible to find someone out here... that can think outside of their own caste system right now. I mean, look at this man across the street in a tie. This is a ruling-class man... and he's actually suffering from oxygen deprivation. He's brain-dead. Can I sell you a shirt? You know? And it's like, look at this magazine. Buy this magazine. You might be able to stimulate some thought in yourself... you know, switch your gestalt so that you might have some perception... and be able to see our way out of this. Alleviate suffering, make us enjoy it or something, you know. I mean, we're walking around here right now, and it's really time for us to take action. All right? We're being taxed out of our asses... to pay for a monopoly on guns by people to oppress us already. I'm saying if I'm gonna pay taxes on guns and weapons... that I at least wanna possess them, because I have work for them right now. I have some very serious work for them. Something very permanent about death. - We gotta go. - Remember... terrorism's the surgical strike capability of the oppressed. - Thanks. - Keep on keepin' on. You everjust want to get the hell out of this country? - And go where? - I don't know, anywhere. It doesn't matter. Just some other place. I don't know. I've traveled. And all it is is bad water, bad food, you get sick. You gotta deal with strange people. And when you get back, you can't tell whether it really happened to you... or you just saw it on TV. We finally got out of the terrific heat of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean. It was just a few degrees cooler. And then as we got toward Bombay, a wonderful thing happened. There was a breeze blowing out to sea. And it brought the scent of spices out to us three miles out from shore. A great wall of incense and spices. And it was as if we were being wafted into shore on a magic carpet. The next person who passes us... will be dead within a fortnight. - Paper? - No, thank you. Two-for-one special. - No. I don't - - Well. - Hey, have you got change? - You've got a strong back. Get a job. No, I mean. I have a dollar. I was wondering if I could get change for- Change. I've got change. You should quit. Quit. You should quit. You should quit. - You should quit. - Howdy. - What do you need? - Can I have a cup of coffee? Quit following me. You heard me: Quit following me. You should never, never, never, never, never traumatizing. You should never- You should never- You, you, you - You should - You should -You - You should never traumatize a woman sexually. I should know. I'm a medical doctor. You should never traumatize. You should never name things in order. You should have to label the order- Hey, cool it down over here. Ordering. Ordering one, one. Toothpicks, toothpicks. Toothpick labeling. - A large coffee to go. - Quit, quit. You should quit. You should quit. You should- You should- You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse. I should know. I'm a medical doctor. I own a mansion and a yacht. You should quit traumatizing women... with sexual intercourse. I should know. I'm a medical doctor. You should quit. You should quit. You should - You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse. I should know. You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse. I should know. I'm a medical doctor. I should know. You should quit. You should never, never know. You never know. Hey, watch where the hell you're going! See, I'm a drifter from Texas. I smoke a lot of pot. Sometimes I trip out to acid. And, uh, wow, it's like the most horrible scene. Now you tell me how you can live in an apartment... with the pieces of a person rotting away, with decay and not know it. I was totally sick during that period. So you didn't kill her, but you did carve her up? - No. - Who carved her up? There was, like, three people involved in the carving. So you're denying that you killed her... and you're denying that you took part in carving her up? - Washing bones. - Why were you washing bones? - They were smelly. - Then why didn't you tell the police- - God, that is so gross. Hmm? I said it's nice outside. We should go do something. - Like what? - Well, there is a lake in this town. We could go out there. We could go out to the hills. We could go to the park and play Frisbee. I hate shit like that. All that nature. And the sunlight's so oppressive now. And you don't just go to the lake. You have to prepare for it. You have to get suntan lotion and insecticide. It's like premeditated fun. It's too hot outside anyway. You know, did it ever occur to you that maybe you're what's oppressive? I mean, " Let's never go out. Let's never venture out of this one-square-mile area." You're just what they want. Look. If you're so eager and all fired up... to get out of the house today, why don't you do that? Why don't you go to the drugstore and cash a check... and go to the Kmart and buy a Frisbee. It takes two people to play Frisbee. Well, buy a boomerang. Better yet, I got an idea. I know something that we could do together... and we wouldn't have to leave the house, and we wouldn't have to buy anything. That's the one thing that would be more effective on my own. - Oh, yeah? - They're back. Whoa! All right! Come on, guys. We're wasting time. - Hey, you want a Coke? - Half price. - Diet Coke and Diet Sprite. - Diet Coke. Hey, come on, man. This shit's getting heavy. - Come on. - No, bug off. I don't want one. - Lighten up a little, why don't you? - Fuck off, kid. - Diet Coke? - Man, you guys got... - horrible attitudes. This is it. Put the typewriter right there. - So what do we do now? I'm really late. - First of all, give him the tent. Now recite exactly what I told you to say and throw the tent in. This was her tent. - I fucked her in this tent. - A little more feeling. I fucked her in this tent. She's probably gonna fuck a lot of other guys. She's off to a good start. But she's not gonna fuck 'em in this tent. - She's not gonna fuck 'em in this tent. - She's not gonna fuck 'em in this tent. Throw it in. Now the typewriter. - Come on, man. - I don't wanna throw the typewriter in. You gotta throw the typewriter in. That's why we brought it here. I been thinking about it. I don't want to throw it in. - This is juvenile. - Here, you shut up. When he throws the typewriter in, read the passage that's marked in the book. Look, man. This is stupid. I'm not gonna throw it in, man. Why in the hell is he throwing it in? It's a perfectly good typewriter. The typewriter isn't the point. The point is it symbolizes the bitch that just fucked him over. It symbolizes the bitch that fucked me over six months ago. And it symbolizes the bitch that's gonna fuck you over. Fuck you. I don't wanna read your book. - Here. You read it. - I'm not gonna read this fuckin' book. It will make a lot more sense if you read it. - I'm not gonna - - Hey! Goddamn! See how easy that was? - No problem. Now, just - - Dick. It all makes sense if you just read this passage here. What did you do with the bookmark? I didn't do anything with the bookmark. - There wasn't one in there. - This is when Leopold discovers... that he's just been fucked over by his wife. He says, " If he had smiled, why would he have smiled? "To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter? "Whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series. "Even if the first term of succeeding ones each imagining himself to be first... "last, only and alone. "Whereas he is neither first, nor last, nor only, nor alone... in a series originating in and repeated to infinity." Hey, wait up. - Hey, how's it going? - Hi. Okay. Where have you been? - Oh, nowhere. - We've gotta get a move on. - I got you something. - What? - Great. NutraSweet, my favorite. - Come on, I got it for half price. - Budding capitalist youth. - Say, y'all. Y'all got some change. - Yeah. - Nah. - There you go. - Thank you. - You want a soda? - Yeah, I appreciate it. You know, there's something very wrong with that. What, that I gave the guy your Coke? The quarter? Both of them, both of them. It's bad for both of you. Him because it's not really gonna help him. And you because that relationship is naturally going to involve... that condescending element, maybe even contempt. Granted giving the man a quarter isn't gonna change his life around. I do realize that. There are better ways to help. - I've been looking into these groups. - That's what I'm talking about. That's exactly what I'm talking about. See, we're conditioned to assume... that suffering is bad. It's not. See, when you pity someone... all you're able to see is this base creature in them. You can't see any true potential. I think it's their potential I do see. But it's like all these other futile causes that you fall into. They all stem from a certain weakness. You know, psychologically, helping everyone else out is easier. It's an escape from working on yourself, from perfecting yourself. Yeah, Mr. Perfect here. You know, that's what I hate. When you start talking like this. It's like you're just pulling these things from the shit you read. You haven't thought it out for yourself, no bearing on the world around us... and totally unoriginal. Great. Personal attacks now, is that it? I thought we were beyond that. It's like you just pasted together these bits and pieces... from your authoritative sources. I don't know. I'm beginning to suspect maybe there's nothing really in there. Suspect, you're beginning to suspect. Oh, that's rich. That's really rich. So what? At least what is there is based on good sources. At least I'm not chained to this slave morality that seems to rule your life. Thank you very much. You know, everyone else just thinks you're an asshole. - Great. - The more I get to know you... I just feel sorry for you. - I'm glad they think I'm an asshole. - I bet you are. I don't think anyone who's ever done anything... hasn't been considered an asshole by the general populace. - I mean, look at Freud. - Yeah, let's look at Freud. Man. - I mean, Bob Dylan. - Let's forget it. We're late. - We've already missed it. - Oh, no. Come on. Come on. We can make it. There's gonna be five minutes of trailers. It'll be no problem. We missed the beginning. Hang it up. I'm gonna go look at some books. I just need to get away for a little bit. I need some quiet. How about the next show, two hours from now. I'll meet you there. You've been wanting to see it. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? I'll meet you there. See you. Oh, I see you're reading Rush toJudgment. - Oh, yeah. I guess I am. - Oh, that's an excellent book. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey. We had a class a couple of years ago, remember? No, what class? It was an anthropology class in ethnographic film. Oh, yeah, yeah. The dancing birth scenes. Those death rituals. - Yeah, yeah. - I remember that. - What have you been up to? - Not too much. I graduated a couple of years back. Just pretty much hanging out. - Yourself? - Oh, yeah, you know me. I've been, uh, keeping up with my J.F.K. assassination theories, you know. - Oh, really? - Yeah. You know, you're reading one of the great books on the subject. It's great. Rush toJudgment has all the testimony, you know... of all the witnesses who were never called before the Warren Commission. You know, like Mrs. Aquilla Clemmons... who was that maid who lived on Patton Street who saw the Tippet shooting. It wasn't Oswald that did it. Of course you know it was Jack Ruby. - Oh, really? I didn't realize that. - Oh, yes. This is also the book that's got the testimony of Sam Holland, you know... the Prince of the Puff of Smoke. Yeah, he was up there on the overpass over Dealey Plaza... and he was able to just see everything. I really don't know too much about this. I was kind of just flipping through. Oh, well, it's really good. If you like that... you should really read one of the other books around here. It might be here. Best Evidence. That's the one with all the head-snap stuff in it. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Of course, if you like that, you should really read Six Seconds in Dallas... 'cause, you know, Six Seconds is the one that's got all the trajectories... and the triangulation of the bullets and stuff. And it's great. It's just got this like second by second account... of just the entire tragic sequence, you know. - That's fascinating. Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But then, of course, then there's my real favorite one right here... which you really should snap up if you can. Forgive my Grief. It is great. 'Cause, you know, this also has all this testimony in it. Like, gosh, you know, they talked to Mrs. Erlene Roberts, you know... who was Oswald's landlady and stuff. Oh, yeah. And she swears that she saw this, uh, Dallas patrol car... pull up in front of Oswald's house... - and give this little "Tit-Tit." - "Tit-Tit"? Yeah, yeah. It was the tip-off for Oswald, you know? Yeah, he was supposed to go up the street up Beckly Avenue - he was in Oak Cliff- to go to the Steak and Egg Kitchen... where he was supposed to meet with J.D. Tippet... and have their "breakfast of infamy." Yeah, yeah. You know, the waitresses went on record in the Warren Report... - saying that Oswald didn't like his eggs and used bad language. - You're kidding. - My goodness. - This is good. But, of course, then there's my book, you know. - You've written one of these books? - Well, I've been working on mine. Yeah. It's gonna be good though. It's gonna be
