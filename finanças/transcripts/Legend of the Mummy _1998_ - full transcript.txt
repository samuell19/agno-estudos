[music] [wind] [rumble] [speaking in egyptian] -Not now, Silvio. Go away. [reading in egyptian] -"We call upon black powers to restore life." No. I won't do it. [screaming] -C'mon, you know this one, Robert. -Canopic jar. -What dynasty? -Nineteenth. Eighteenth. -That'll work. Boy, you are hot today. There's nothing more I can teach you. -You know, Brice, I'd like to review the second and third dynasties. -What's up? You know, I thought you were like the Renaissance art man. Or was that Gina's influence? -No, her influence is over. -Then why the interest? What's her name? -Margaret. Now -I thought so. I'd like to have a drink with her. -Oh, good. Maybe you two will have a good time, because she never wants to see me again. -Oh, well then, why are you studying this? -Because I'm an art historian. This week anyway. Get over here. All right, buddy, start talking. Who are you? -Relax, sir. I though it was just a hallway door. -Listen, who are you? And why are you breaking into my place. -Mrs. Trelawny. She sent me. She said she called. -Hey, where you are is fine. MARGARET (ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Robert, it's Margaret. I know we haven't spoken in a while, but I need your help. Something terrible has happened to my father. I'm sending his driver for you. I'll understand if you don't want to come, but I hope you will. -Cheeky bastard. -All right, so what exactly happened at the house. -I really don't know. I'm not too involved in the goings on at the house. All I know is there was a lot of blood. I haven't seen you before. Do you work for Mr. Trelawny? -No, I'm an art historian. -Friend of Mrs. Trelawny, then. -Yeah, we met at her show. -Oh, yeah, the photographs. -Good evening, sir, Mr. Wyatt. -WYATT: Yes. -Won't you come in? I believe Miss Margaret will be down in a few moments. -Thank you. -If I could take your bag, sir. And your coat, perhaps. -Thank you. -Thank you, sir. -Robert, you came. -Margaret. -What happened? -He's upstairs. -How is he? -Terrible. He's unconscious. -Have you call the doctor? -He's with him now. Father was alone in his study. I heard a scream. I walked in to the room. His arm was all torn up. There was blood everywhere. -Ah, Margaret, I just about finished. Seems to have lost a great deal of blood. I think he could do with a couple of units. And I do have some of his own plasma. -Why don't you take him to a hospital? -No, my father hates hospitals. -I don't think I've ever seen a coma quite like this. -(UK ACCENT) No one entered through these doors. Who are you? -Robert Wyatt, friend of Margaret's. And you? -Daw, head of security for all Trelawny industries. -How do you know no one came from the balcony? -Or I should say no one forced their way through those doors. I've seen enough forced doors in my time at the Yard to know. Came in through this door. Unless he did it to himself. -I think we can rule that out. He has too much respect for life. -Well, there it is. And where were you again when this happened? -I was in my dark room. I hadn't seen my father all day. -No? The housekeeper Mrs. Grant said she heard Mr.Trelawny talking to you. Called you by name. -She must be mistaken. -Maybe he was dictating. -Uh, Mr. Wyatt, if you please, could you give us a moment alone? -I want him to stay. I've asked him to be here. MR. TRELAWNY (RECORDED VOICE); Margaret, I'm on the verge of a discovery, if all goes well. If not, and I am suddenly stricken down by accident or attack, you must follow my directions to the letter. If I'm not already in my study, I am to be taken there. Once there, you I must never be left alone, not for a single instant. Day and night, at least two persons must remain in the room. And none of the Egyptian artifacts can be moved. There's a special purpose in the placing of each piece. Also, the small key must remain on my wrist. My life will be in your hands. DAW: Does anyone know what this key opens? -Uh, no I don't. -MR. TRELAWNY (RECORDED): Not now, Silvio, go away. I won't do it. (SCREAMING) -He sent me away when I was seven. It's taken me all this time to be with, and now this. -He knew someone was after him, and it was probably someone in the house. -MARGARET: I really don't know any of the people here. ROBERT: You know, he really should be moved to a hospital. MARGARET: My father has his reasons for staying in the house. I don't know what they are, but I don't want to second guess him. Wyatt, I need your help. -OK, I'm not leaving. [[squeaks] [eating sounds] -(BRITISH ACCENT) If you need anything, just call, sir. -Oh, hey, you can call me Robert. What's your name? -Lily Mrs. Grant's daughter. You live in SoMa? I hear there are a lot of clubs there. -Yeah, a lot of clubs. -Do you think you could-- I mean, if there were some clubs where you could get me in. -Little lonely for you in this house? -Gives me the jitters. Sounds a bit odd, but the house has its own personality. It makes strange noises, especially that study. Late one night, the door was open a crack, the lights began to dim, and I heard a banging coming from behind the door. I knew Mr. Trelawny was already asleep in his bedroom, so I started to peek my head in-- -(CAT HISSING) I have my chores, sir. -Well, wait, wait what did you see? -It's supposed to rain tonight. You might want to close your window before you put your head down. -Hearing this noise from down the hill. What's down there? -The stables. -Horses. -There are no horses anymore. Mr. Trelawny gave them away a few months back. -Hmm -Oh, um, can we get the heat turned up a bit? I'll get you a space heater from the basement, sir. -Thanks. [angry cat meow] -Can you believe this rot? Can't be moved. Two people watching him. I mean, why is this being treated like some sort of a mystic thing? -I don't know. -You and Margaret seem quite familiar. Wonder why I've never heard your name before. -(SIGHING) We, uh, barely got to know each other before we had a little falling out. You know hot it is. Listen, have you talked to the driver yet? -Jimmy? -Yeah, I saw him with a silver flask. I think it belonged to Mr. Trelawny. -Hmm. I spoke with him briefly. But he's still on my list. -Robert? Would you mind taking the late shift with my father? We're tired, and I remember you get up late. -Yeah. Fuck. -(FROM UPSTAIRS) Lily, where did you go off to? -Mum, I'm just down in the basement getting a space heater for Mr. Wyatt. What's that? I'm not cleaning that mess up. -[laughing] [phone ringing] -What? Robert, do you have any idea what time it is? -Yeah, it's after midnight. I knew you wouldn't be doing anything important. -Yeah, and I was having a damn good time doing it. ROBERT (ON THE PHONE): Listen, I got something here. It's a small hand rake, except it's shaped like a snake with fangs. -Uh. How many? -Uh, seven. -RICHARD: Oh, boy. Yeah, you know, that sounds like a mouth-opening staff used during mummification. One hundred grand, easy. -That explains why it's bashed in the head, but not why someone's digging in the dirt with it. -No, don't go yet. -I should be going anyway. -Robert, can we talk about this in the morning? -Yeah, one more thing, stone tablet in two pieces, one big symbol, a man with a dog's head. -Nibba, whoa, master of the mysteries. It's very important for mummification and resurrection. Boy, I just hope none of that stuff is stolen, you know, the curse. -Don't give me that King Tut bullshit. -No. Although, I'll tell you, years ago workers on the Aswan Dam stumbled upon an undiscovered tomb full of treasure. Two diggers took sapphire eyes out of a Pharaoh's statue. The next day, they were found burnt to a crisp. -C'mon, you don't believe that. -Well, I don't, but my old professor does, though. And get this, he lost an eye that same night in a freak accident. Yeah. Girls love that story, yeah. It scares the hell out of them. I'm, I'm, I'm almost-- Oh, man. ROBERT (ON PHONE): Gotta go, Brice. -Changing of the guard. -It's about time. It's a ridiculous exercise, two people when one will do. -Hi, I am Robert. -Hello. -Oh, yes. Mrs. Grant was out when you arrived. You were at church, wasn't it? Confessing you said? -I said I was praying for Mr. Trelawny. -Yes, well, I'm off to the city. I'll be back tomorrow. -He's right. I can take care of him myself. -Oh, that's OK. I promised Margaret I'd do it. What is that smell? I keep getting a strong whiff of a pungent-- -Oh, the rich aroma of ancient Egypt. It's these artifacts. They reek of it. I can't imagine it's good for Mr. Trelawny. -No! Margaret! -What have you got there? -So, have you worked for Mr. Trelawny very long? -Going on 30 years. Do you believe what that pompous ass implied? Doesn't know the difference between confession and saying the rosary. This man means the world to me, and he should be in hospital right now. -Is there something I should do? Should I go get the doctor? -He seems all right now. But that's the third time he's done that since I've been here. I'm going to insist very strenuously that he be moved. -I'm gonna go get some fresh air. -Hutchins? -Yes, Miss. -Where are you going? -We're leaving, Miss. I told Gwen, after what's just happned to her, I think she and Lily should leave, too. Strange things have happened here over the last few years. This was just too much. -Mrs. Grant told me that you're a very superstitious man. But my father needs you now. Please, don't go. -Keeping the police from getting involved is becoming increasingly difficult. Someone is obviously trying to kill your father. -And Mrs. Grant obviously gone in their way. -Have there been any strange by, unusual phone calls, so on and so forth? -Not that I remember. -What about the prints from the study? -Keene is processing them. -There was someone he was expecting, but he never showed up. -Someone? -He was very upset, and then a package came, and he was calm again. -A name? -What was his name? It was Cor-- Corbin-- -Corbeck? -That's it. John Corbeck. -A dreadful man, a liar, a thief, a grave robber. -C'mon, tell us what you really think. -You listen to me. I know about him from my days at the Yard. Let's just say we're fortunate this man has not set foot in this house. -Seems like you hit a nerve. -I need a break. And a kiss. [snoring] -J. Corbeck. -That tape was fantastic. Do you really think any of that stuff was stolen? -Man, I hope not. -OK. OK, from 1967, it seems everything in Trelawny's study is from this tomb, the tomb of Queen Tera, very powerful 5,000 years ago. OK, it's a;; been recorded in the expedition logs, but none of it has been seen since. I was actually at this tomb myself 10 years ago. Some of the items haven't even been touched. -Why not? -Well, you know, Queen Tera was killed by her priests, because of her popularity with the masses. Her dying breath was a curse for touching anything. I mean, you're cursed even if you talk about what you've seen, which I never have, until now. -Brice, you really believe these curses, don't you? -Nah, when you get down to it, curses aren't that interesting. -Wyatt. -I'll print off hard copies of this stuff. -Yeah. OK, look, you gotta move faster for me. -Hold on a sec. Please. OK, what are you saying? You don't have a number for him? All right, look, I gotta go. Brice! OK, this is a hell of a curse. -Girls get a big kick when I do that. OK. -Yes? -Hello, I'm looking for John Corbeck. Does he live here? -No. -But he did live here, didn't he? -No. -Can I see that? His favorite cigars. -I'm Robert Wyatt, I'm a friend of Abel Trelawny's. -Trelawny. John hasn't been here in a while. -Well, do you know where he is now? It's important. -John did live here on and off, um, for a few years. But he left suddenly. -Why? -I don't know. -Do you know what his business was with Mr. Trelawny? -No. He sent me-- he sent me an old lamp, and he said it was important I take it to Trelawny personally, that it competed a set. And when John got back from his last trip, he was consumed with finishing an assignment. He sat outside a lot, after dark. He said he was studying the night sky. And with every day that went past, he grew more distant. Look, if you are a friend, maybe you can help him. -What's this? -He's been there about a month. If you do see him, be careful. He's strong, and he can be violent. -Ah. Here's-- the journals of Abel Trelawny. Yeah, should pay for my retirement. -[bumping] -Playground down here. "Today is the saddest day of my life. I had to send Margaret away. I will not have her involved. I cried when I saw her go. I will cry every day. Yep, that's the start of it. And that's the end. -[growling] -Silvia? Is that you? Come back to say goodbye, did you? -John Corbeck? My name is Robert Wyatt. -I'm not interested, son. -I'm here for Abel Trelawny. -And I'm here because of Abel Trelawny. -What do you mean? -Enough. -Look, Margaret said you were supposed to come to the house. -Margaret is at the house? -Yeah, for about six weeks now. -Done. I'm done. Enough. -Look, you sent a package he was waiting for, didn't you? -I sent many packages to Abel Trelawny through the years. -Look, something's happened at the house. -Something has happened to me. -Yeah, what did happen to you anyway? -All right, I had just returned from one of my many expeditions finding artifacts for Abel Trelawny. And I had to arrange the artifacts around the floor to examine them, when suddenly I got the acute sense of being watched. I grew hot and weak. My vision was blurred. It's not the normal situation when I drink, I assure you. The lights went out. And all of a sudden in the air a sort of must of ancient tombs and a colors. The senses-- sacred the hell out of me. I haven't been that scared since I was a boy. I found myself standing up on a ledge to a window stark naked with nothing but a headdress, screaming, "My God help me. God help me." And I don't even believe in God. Someone called the police, as if it was unusual behavior for San Francisco. Well, you go back and tell him that. -Abel's in a coma. -What? -He was attacked, and we don't know who did it. -Is there any marks on him, on his wrists, on his neck, like seven scratches side-by-side? -How did you know that? -You must take me to the house. Everyone in the house is in danger, especially Margaret. -Well, I can't. -Look I know how to stop it. We must complete the task that it asks for us, but I must be there. -There's the little matter of this door. Someone feels that you should stay here. -It is not that they think that I'm crazy. It is that I think that I'm crazy. Now, will you take me there? -I want you to find out all you can about the latest whereabouts of John Corbeck. There's a file in my office, start with that. And don't come here anymore, don't call me. I'll contact you. The reason I put you on this case in the first place-- -(JAMAICAN ACCENT): Is because I am the best. And where will you be staying? -Here, for the time being at least. -You can have this house. It has the same feeling as the woods back home. It gives me them creeps. Well, I'm out of here. -It really does have some extraordinary pieces here, doesn't he? -I suppose so. I prefer the Impressionists. -Really? You've been estranged from your father for quite some time, haven't you? Sent away to school at seven, lived in Switzerland, France, and here in the United States. -That's right. -Really haven't had much of a relationship for, what is it, two decades? And suddenly you develop this keen interest to visit him. -I've been trying to come here for years. My father has always turned me down. -Really? Yet, here you are. -One day I showed up at the front gate, uninvited and unannounced. I was drawn here for some reason. I knew it was time to be home. Have you found anything new? -We're still checking a few things. -Such as? -What exactly was your location during the attack on Mrs. Grant? -I was in my room. -Mr. Wyatt says you were the first person to enter the study. -And? -He said he could only see shadows through the curtains. He couldn't make out the attacker. It's odd that both your father and Mrs. Grant seem to have had their worst luck when you were nearest to them. -Where was I when Mrs. Grant was attacked? Your father seem to have his worse luck when you're nearest to him? -I'm conducting an investigation, no more. It's my job. -Not anymore -I work for your father, not you. If that's a problem for you, well, there it is. I should've have thought you'd want me to be thorough. -Find whoever did this to him, Mr. Daw. -I certainly will do just that, Miss. ABEL TRELAWNY (VOICEOVER): School in Paris will be best for you now. It's only a few hours away. -Daddy, don't send me away. I need you. -ABEL TRELAWNY: Oh, my darling, it'll be best for you. -Margaret, I think you should see this. There's snaps of your mother. -I don't understand. Father said all the pictures of her were burned during the fire. -Not these. -She was so pretty. -I'll let you look at them by yourself. -All right now, let's see what you've been up to, Mr. Corbeck. I can do astrology, alignment of the stars, um-- That's tomorrow night. Daw's gonna love this. Gonna throw me a party at the Trelawny estate. Dancing girls, beautiful women, in Jamaican-- Just paid the bill-- What do you want! It's true. -Margaret. -John Corbeck? -I've often wondered how you'd look. And how you would speak. -You had business with my father? -Much more personal than that. Is he in the study? -What exactly was it? -I must see him now. -Mr. Corbeck, my father is seriously ill, and I know nothing about you. -That could be a blessing. I, however, know a great deal about you. Your father and I, we go back a long way. This bracelet he found at a previously undisturbed grave site near Tiba, 1961. This sculpture here, Giza, 1966, I believe. We had a deuce of a time trying to convince the locals to let us near that site. Your father was so excited he fell off a steep hill. Damn near broke his neck. But it was on the next expedition that matters most. You were born on that dig, as far as I remember. I know what's wrong with your father. -The doctor thinks-- -Uh-uh, doctors cannot help him. I must see him alone. -He said there are to be two people in the room with him at all times. -Oh, there will be. Your father still counts, doesn't he? You old fool, translated it, didn't you? (GROANING) -These are the instructions to the dead. We've got to find the other half. -(EGYPTIAN SPEAKING) -He says it won't be here. This tablet was broken for a good reason. And the other half was sent to the end of the Earth. Look! The gods will not come at any summons. The nameless one has insulted them, and is forever alone. Do not enter or-- -Or what? -Their vengeance will wither you away. --Don't worry. Don't worry. -I've been here before, but I thought it was just a dream. Or a nightmare. A nightmare still have. -Hey, come here. -Queen of the Egypts. Daughter of Antiff. Monarch of the North and South. Daughter of the sun. Tera. -John, over here. This is it. C'mon. The jewel, it is Queen Tera. Pack it up. Pack everything. -Look at her hand. Do you really think we can get out of here alive, or without being thrown in chains for eternity? -I think we are one step closer to finding out what eternity really is. Pack it up. -We both agreed that we wouldn't try it unless we were here together. Well, I'm here now. On that last expedition with Abel, we traveled to the Valley of the Sorcerer, which is where we discovered the tomb for the most powerful woman in all of Egypt, Queen Tera herself. -She was too powerful. The priests were going to have her killed because she was usurping their authority. -Well, that is the official story. The truth is somewhat different. She heard of the plot, and she came up with an intricate plan. She would have herself mummified. -Weren't all royalty mummified back then? -Yes, but she had her own doctors and her own tomb. That, and along with other incantations and other white magic, she said that she would one day soon return. And she always kept her promises. -Wonderful, Corbeck. A simply wonderful performance from a very accomplished conman. Sargent -Still smuggling, are you? Or have you moved up to out-and-out theft of private-- Sargent John is a guest in this house. -That's all right, Margaret. Sargent Daw and I go back a few years. We have a every equitable relationship. He hates me. And I have other things to do rather than think of him, like saving Abel's life. I knew her very well. Your father loved her very much. -Then why did he leave her alone when she was pregnant? -He didn't want to go, but she insisted. -What was so important about this expedition that it couldn't wait? -We had found Queen Tera's tomb. As far as we could tell, when we opened the tomb, you were born. Two days later, we heard of your mother's death. Abel was never the same. Never spoke to anyone for a year. Couldn't work. He hated it, but he had to send you away. -I thought just wasn't important to him. -Oh, far from it. We talked for many hours. He kept tabs on you. He was very, very proud. You have your mother's heart. The sarcophagus in the study, she's inside, Queen Tera. -Margaret, hey, I saw Corbeck reading this. It's amazing. It's all here. There's, um, Queen Tera, Valium Sorcerer. -Where's the special jewel? I don't think he's telling the truth. MARGARET: Make love to me. [thunder] BRICE (WHISPERING): Robert. -Brice? What the hell you doing here? -You're not going to believe this. Whoa. A sudden Egyptian interest? Not bad. -Hey, hey, hey, Brice, what the hell you doing here? -I came to warn you. Boy, you aren't kidding. This place is great. -Hey, c'mon, warn me about what? -Ok, I talked to a colleague of mine about this tomb business, then I mentioned Corbeck. Swear to God, Robert, the man went white as a ghost. -So, is Corbeck some kind of a conman? -No, no, no, he used to be some kind of like respected expedition leader, until he found the tomb of Queen Tera, then he went like nuts. I mean, he started mummifying people. -What are you, high or something? -I'm honest. He's trying to mummify real people. I'm not joking. [scraping] -What is that? Brice! -Robert! No! -Brice! When he was at Scotland Yard he had a protege, Terry Branigan, 23 years old, six months in the force. So I assigned him to follow Corbeck. Seems Corbeck does have a history of smuggling. Anyway, late one night Branigan was following him, and during the course of a high speed chase, Corbeck beat a train at a crossing. Branigan didn't. -Dangerous business. Being up here reminds me of the first time you and I met. -You know, I loved your pictures at that show of yours. Hey, I wanna propose a toast to your next show. -Robert, you know I can't stand champagne. I'm just going to us some water. -OK. -Whoa. The sudden Egyptian interest, not bad. -What the hell you doing here? -You're not going to believe this. Oh, great. I am starved. All right, now, I found out because Trelawny has found so many treasures, and he gave so much money, he has this special arrangement with the Egyptian Minisitry of Antiquities to study the artifacts here. And well, of course like when he dies, all the research and all the antiquities go back to Egypt. -So he's got permission. Man, that's the best news you could've told me. -This is great. Oh, I was taking a look at that videotape you sent over. I'm telling you, there are some things on there that have never even been cataloged. -Look, you gotta go, man. MARGARET: Hi. -Hi. Brice Renard. -This is Margaret. Brice is a, uh, colleague. -Colleague? I believe I taught him everything he knows. -Yeah, Brice is the janitor-- -Curator. -Curator of Egyptian exhibit at the De Young Museum. -I, uh-- You know, I heard that Robert was staying over at your place, and I would give my first born to be able to come over and take a look at all that. -Any time -Great, you know, actually, take a look at this. Look at the mill work on that. -Wow, it looks like Third Dynasty. Isn't that a little pricey to carry around in your pocket? -Nah, I do it all the time. -It's beautiful. How old is it? -Well, technically speaking, very old. But we won't know for sure until we get the test back. -ROBERT: Brice? Hey, Brice, man you OK? Brice? Brice! -I just, I-- need to get some fresh air. -Ow! -What happened? -I cut me on this bloody knife. -Oh! Doctor better take a look at that. -Maybe you could bring him up here. -You sit tight. I'll be right back. -Well, Abel, you didn't know I knew about your secret place, did you? Oh, what's this? A copy of you special key. Now, let's see what you got in here. Beautiful. Beautiful, gov, my compliments. -Last night, I was reading a book by a Dutch explorer, named Van Huene. He mentioned a seven-sided ruby. -Strange reading for bedtime. -There's also a drawing of the jewel, reflecting the light of seven stars. -Ah, is that so? -Perhaps the jewel is the reason you're here now. -I heard Abel talk of the jewel quite recently. -I'm here to help my friend. -Is that right? -That's right. -You know. it's extraordinary, but I can find you in my hair every time someone close to me gets hurt. Tell you something, the next one hurt will be you. -Is that a threat? -Game of darts anyone? OPERATOR (ON PHONE): May I help you? -I need to talk to someone at Abel Trelawny estate. Uh, my friend Robert is there. I need to warn him. OPERATOR: Sir, would you like me to connect you to directory assistance? -Uh, Abel Trelawny's estate. It's the curse. They're all going to die. -OPERATOR: I'll connect you to the Sheriff's Department. -This scarab-- -SHERIFF (ON PHONE): Marin County Sheriff's Department-- -I was looking at her face, she was looking-- SHERIFF: Just calm down, sir. Are you still there, sir? -Excuse me, Jimmy's injured himself. -Oh, dear. -Wonder where Margaret is. I think I'll have a little check outside. -Ah! Lily! -Ah! -What's above this room? -Who's watching Abel? -My god, he's alone. -What the hell? -No! -He's in here. -Hold on to something. -What's happening, John? -Father! Something's happening in there. -Lily, stay there. All right, everyone just hold on. -MARGARET: Please, do something. -All right, get out of the way. Step back. -Wait! Let me go first. MARGARET: Father? CORBECK: Good god. MARGARET: He needs me. ROBERT: No, no, let the doctor help him. -Gwen, he my bag. -Why did you love the bloody doors? Jesus Christ. -It's all right to be afraid. Tera will not release your father. She'll hold him for ransom until she gets what she wants. -What does she want? -For her spirit to breath again. -I don't care if you believe in this bollocks you talk. But it's over. It's finished! If your queen is inside here, she's dust. She's no more alive that the dust my housekeeper sweeps off the bloody floor. CORBECK: You're more the fool than I thought. Tera, he doesn't know what he's talking about. He's got no soul. -Please, this is very delicate work. -All right, let's just take it easy. Margaret, we should get out of here, all of us. Your father needs to be hospitalized. -Tera will not let him leave. -You didn't tell me. What does she want? -We'll have to ask her. -He wants a bloody seance now, is it? -Not a seance, you idiot! -Or channeling or whatever the hell you call it. -No, no. Not in this house. Please, miss, I'll leave. I don't want to leave him. And I will. I'm a God fearing woman, and I believe it when the church says that it's a sin to contact the dead. -You know what you are? Pathetic. Pathetic! Filling this young girl's head up with rubbish. Leading her on while her father lies there-- ROBERT: Knock it off! Knock it off! MARGARET: Stop! ROBERT: Philip! -That's quite enough. -Don't do anything you're going to regret. -My only regret is I didn't do this a bloody long time ago. -Stop! You two fighting your private battle will not help my father. John, I really don't believe in any of that. -In this house, guns will not help you. -Wait, Silvio, wait. [meow] So -Wait, wait, wait. I don't think you have enough lives to go down there, baby. [door opening] -God help me. [singing in egyptian] ROBERT: Margaret! Margaret! [speaking in egyptian] ROBERT: Margaret! Margaret, what are you doing? DOCTOR: Come, pull yourself together, Margaret. -Is that still she? DOCTOR: We need to take her back to the house. ROBERT: We need to wait for the storm to pass. -We've been at this a long time, my friend. Now, let's see if it's all been nothing. [speaking in egyptian] -What sort of language is that, then? -It's ancient Egyptian. -Ah, listen to this, Abel. She's telling us that she's Tera, Queen of the Egypts, Daughter of Ateff, Monarch of the North and the South, Daughter of the Sun. She's introducing herself in the most customary manner. -I've seen some cons, but this takes the cake. Queen Tera, my girl? You're no more a bloody queen than I am. ROBERT: Margaret! -I know where the jewel is. I know where the lamps are. I know about Abel's plan. And I know what you want, Tera. And I promise you, you shall have it. -Christ! -Trust John. Do what he says. -Abel's been planning this for years. The great experiment he called it. Bringing Tera what she wanted to see if the legacy could be fulfilled. So, for years, we collected everything. Amulets, canopic jars, lamps-- -And the mummy. -Yes, even Tera herself. We dismantled her, her tomb, piece-by-piece and brought it here to the house. -What? -Yes. We will capture the changes in stars over 5,000 years, and pick this as the perfect location for this experiment. What we're looking for is the key to the tomb, the obelisk. It was accidentally returned to the museum in Egypt. I had to retrieve it, and then I had to hide it. I was about to deliver it to Abel, when I spotted Daw entering the house. Not wanting to renew our acquaintance at the time, and not wanting to keep it to myself-- -Why is that? -Well, I didn't quite have all the right permits when I left Cairo. Didn't know it was the bloody key to the bloody door. Ah, shine the light. -Ah, John. What are you doing, man? -It's here. I know, I put it here. It's got to be here. I put it here. -John, let's stop. Let's go back. -Hey, don't fuck with me, man! It is here. -John, there's nothing in here. OK! Ah, it's a head. -Oh, god! -Tera was not the only mummy Abel and I brought back through the years. Abel hid the mummies for many years, preparing for his experiment. He learned that Tera planned to come back alone, she's being back a court as well. Abel gathered the other mummies from her court, and destroyed them, then buried them in unsanctified ground. -OK, look, I'm getting Margaret out of here tonight. -No, we must find this key, and complete the-- -No, no, John we should all get out of here. We'll get Abel-- -No! We must find the key. -It's not here! Look there's nothing here but dead things. Look! Man, what am I doing here? This is crazy. Look, nothing. It's empty, just like Abel's fantasies. Ow! John, John, give me a hand here. Ah! -You think you're going to take Margaret away, do you? There are forces here far greater than you could ever understand. -It's ripping my fucking arm off. Get back here, you bastard. You shoulda stayed in that damn institution, you crazy old-- No! -There it is. The key to the tomb, the obelisk. -Oh, John, I don't know what the hell's going on here. Whatever it is-- -She's not going to go to let us go until she gets what she wants. -There's not much hope left here. -We can't give up. -The key's not there. It hasn't been since his last attack. -Do you have the key? -No, I don't have the key. -We need it. We need to get the jewel, and the jewel is in the safe. Without the jewel, he will die. We've got to find that key! -When I was at the Yard, I met a very interesting gentleman, a very talented burglar And he could make short work of any lock. He was also very willing to share his talents with me. -We're gonna have to move everything down to the tomb, including the queen herself. -That's it. -Good. There's a secret compartment in the back. Yes. There it is. Look at it. Look at the life in it, look at-- -Incredible. That is why Abel was attacked, because of this jewel. Thank you very much, Phillip. Abel. Abel, we're moving everything down to the tomb. [tribal drums] CORBECK: We're here. You really did it. Let's bring in the artifacts. -No. Turn her around. Have her facing home. CORBECK: Now, when the seven stars on the plough are finally aligned tonight, the precisely set prism will split the light in to each lamp. Then, we'll see if Abel was right. But first, we must wait. Since you're the most trained, and have a steady hand, Doctor I'll let you do the honors, sir, at the right moment. -Well, you do only live once. -Maybe. -Margaret? -She was my secret. I would talk to her for hours. And one day, father saw me trying to pry the lid open. That's why he sent me away. Wyatt, I need for him to live. DAW (OFF SCREEN): Robert, it's very important I speak to you, please. -Go on. We have time. DOCTOR: -My god, seven fingers. -Doctor, you look tired. You should go home and get some sleep. -Home? This is too fantastic to leave now. -Doctor, (SPEAKING IN EGYPTIAN) -Quite right. I should go. -I don't know what I'm doing. Carrying around mummies. Setting up artifacts as some sort of a cult ceremony. I'm a man of reason. I believe in God, but I sure as hell don't believe in that Queen Tera. I'm leaving. -So, why have you been helping us the last three hours? -Because I had to. See, when Margaret was choking me, I had a sensation, not just the choking, more hypnotic than that, more like a loss of will. -I don't understand. Oh my god. -I can't explain it. I can't think straight anymore. I simply don't want to think anymore at all. I, um, I need to get some sleep. Please tell Margaret that I'll contact her in a few days. -Hey, Phillip, take care of yourself, man. -Where are you going, Sargent? John says it's almost time. -Um, I have some work to do. I shall be back in a few days. -Well, if we don't see each other soon, the best of luck to you. -Goodbye, Robert. -[phone ringing] -Daw. KEENE: Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you. Listen, the Marin sheriff found our man fried like an egg in a phone booth down the hill from you, poor bastard. -Relevance Keene? KEENE: He has Trelawny's address in his pocket. And the butler, Hutchins, his friends called the police and said he was missing, said he went back to the house to collect his things. And what happened to me? Man, you ain't paying me to go through that again. That house is cursed! Get them out of there. -Those bastards! Mr. Trelawny? Oh, Jimmy. Damn! Mr. Trelawny, sir? Good, it's you. I could do with a hand. I seem to be stuck, sinking, you know. Damn you! I need some help! Help! Something's pulling me down. What the hell? I gotta get out of here! Oh, no! -That's it. It's started. Set the lamps, quickly. Quickly, man. Stars don't stand still, Not even for the queen. Now, we'll see. Look. Tera did it. -It's unbelievable. -Look at her skin, untouched by time. -The blood is fresh. -Uh. -She needs her jewel. Stand back. -John, what's going on here? -She's moving. ROBERT: I don't believe it. [thunder] ROBERT: Margaret, get back. -All my father every wanted to do was to help you. Would you please, please release him. ROBERT: Margaret! -Corbeck, we gotta stop this now. Knock that lamp over. Corbeck! -No. -Get the hell out of-- -It's too late to stop it now. -Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? -You never did understand. This is the way it was always supposed to be. This was Abel's desire. The resurrection of Queen Tera. The only thing he did not know when he put the two pieces of tablet together was that she was going to come back through-- --Through me. -Will not stop it. You can't stop this. But tonight, you are to witness a miracle, something that has never happened before. Resurrection of Queen Tera! And you know where she would be without me? Huh? Answer me! -Dust -That's right. She would be dust. Tonight, I hold power. Tonight, it will be my destiny to bring her back to life. -So, she's be nothing without you. -That's right. ROBERT: Yeah, John, that's right. It's all about you, you stupid son of a bitch. -You need me, don't you? Huh? Tonight, I own the power. You cannot do without me. -[knife thrust] [ECSTATIC MOANING -You really must stop worrying about me so much. I'll be fine. If I weren't fine, I wouldn't say so. -How are you feeling, sir? -Very well. Thanks to you. There are a few reminders, however. Margaret told me everything. I'll never forget what you've done for us. -Well, I love your daughter very much, sir. -And we may have a little surprise for you when we get back. -Goodbye, father. We'll be back in a week. -Well, goodbye, sir. -Bye Robert. -You ready? -Wait. I forgot something. I love you very much. -I love you, darling. [woman moaning] -I want more champagne. -Yes, Mrs. Wyatt. -It's been a long time since I've been this happy, Wyatt. Just think, fourteen hours from now we'll be in Paris. The second most romantic place in the world. -The second? What's the first? -Cairo.
