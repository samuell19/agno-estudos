Hey, Abhi. What happened? Can't you see? The bottle just broke. One peg and this guy is already high. You fools! I've been drinking for an hour to overcome my pain. But none of you have asked me the reason. Are you really my friends? Abhi, get up. -Adi, open the door. -He's here. -Let him in. -Calm down, Abhi. What was that, Adi? I heard a lot of noise. Nothing, sir. I accidentally broke a glass. A glass? Here! You can do it yourself. Are you sure? We've driven a long way. The car broke down. -We don't know what went wrong. -Adi, please check. Oh, no! There he goes again. Adi, aren't you missing Divya? While parting ways, weren't you staring into her eyes? I could sense some chemistry there. Adi! What's up, man? Abhi, that's enough for the day. We've come to Goa! We can drink to our heart's content. Get lost, man. Let him be. -He'll just-- -He won't listen to us. Oh. Are they really here? Or, am I dreaming? Abhi! Sit down. Sit down. Are you all from Bengaluru? In India, every person I meet is a software engineer. Don't you guys have anything else to do? Do you have any plans for tomorrow? We've explored every nook and corner of Goa. -What's up with her, at this hour? -I don't know. Let me explain. -I didn't understand. -Let me explain. Mention something you may or may not have done. If you've done it, take a sip. Or else, just keep your mouth shut. -Did you get it? -That's all? Complicated topics are best understood when explained in one's mother tongue. Why do I have to go first? Sid, you must go first. Never have I ever... made out inside a car. Scoundrel! He does that every week. Never have I ever sent "special" pictures to anyone. What kind of pictures? Adi. I... Abhi. Tell us, dude. I... I... have never touched a girl... without her permission. Haven't sneaked a peek... while she undresses. Haven't... stared at her... in a shameful manner. Apparently... Abhi has done all of that with me. Puni? Relax, dude. I'm not sure if we'll ever meet again. Give me the broker's number. I'll call him. No. It won't be right. Just relax. Shut up. Did you get it? Open it, quick. Is this the girl? Or, her mother? You better ask. If God really exists I hope he saves you, Puni. Puni. Did she get her eyes tested recently? Why do you ask? Just to be sure, ask her to get them tested. It's fine. Puni, check the message. The previous photograph was sent by mistake. -This is Manasa. -Really? -Let's see. -Show us. Congrats, dude. Thanks, dude. -She is beautiful. -You will look good together. Adi. Adi. He must be at the balcony. Adi. What happened? Why are you crying? I'm feeling a bit low because you are leaving. Abhi. Siddhartha. Puni, why are you calling them? Relax. Let me talk to them. Adi, what happened? I'm getting sentimental. The best decade of our lives has come to an end. You're right. It's been a decade already. From now on, life will never be this easy. Don't scare him. He is about to get married. He is lucky. He neither drinks nor smokes. He has been tolerating us just because we are his friends. C'mon, guys. I will surely miss you. Congrats, dude. -Once you settle down, do invite us. -Sure, I will. Miss you, dude. Don't forget us. What does Mr. Madhu say? Oh, stop! Hasn't Adi called you? No. I don't think he has feelings for me. Why don't you call him? No, Madhu. Forget it. When will you be coming back to India? I'm not sure when. A new country, new people and a new husband. I wonder what's in store for me. But there is no dearth of Indians in the US. Okay then, I better leave. I need to pack. I've dialed the right number. Nothing. How have you been? I hope you aren't busy. Can we meet tomorrow? I am a bit busy. Let's catch up. So, how are your friends doing? Abhi and Puni got married. Sid is in Germany. What about your friends? Mini is a globe-trotter. Madhu got married. She now lives in the US. Divya. Will you marry me? Do you remember what I told you... about my relationship when we were playing that game in Goa? Are you not curious? Don't you want to know about him? Why? Because I know that you lied. Divya, is it ready yet? I am getting late. Give me two minutes. Meanwhile, put on your shoes. Has he done it yet? Mom thinks that a piece of soapy paper would help. Try it. Please try it. Our lives are pathetic. We want to have fun, but we are toiling away like donkeys. Marriage is best suited for people like Punith. I was very impulsive back then. I wish I wasn't married. The world won't end if our son doesn't excrete for a day. Please stop calling me. We'll deal with it tomorrow. Don't call me again. My son not excreting for a day is a problem for me and my wife. You don't have to put up with problems like these. But I feel as if our lives have reached an end. Dude. Get me a drink. Get lost, dude. It's Sanvi's second birthday, this Saturday. Make sure you are available. Be there for dinner. Okay, we will be there. She has turned two already? Yes. And she's very naughty. She's busy playing right now. Are the arrangements through? I'm still getting things done. Please be there. Divya. It's Sanvi's second birthday. We've been invited for dinner. Sanvi was born two months before our wedding. Oh, yes. What do you want me to gift you on our anniversary? I wasn't hinting at that. If you want to be on-site, take up the California project. It is a long term project. You can settle there. We can consider your wife's job profile as well. I've had this idea for many years now. I know, Adi. You have the potential. But... a start-up's success won't depend solely on you. I hope you have thought this through. I have decided this after a lot of thought. Don't hesitate to call me if you feel like taking up this job again. I'll surely keep in touch, not for the job though. Mom, it's me. How are you? I'm good. How about you? Next month. Mom, I quit my job. You were working for a good organization. I will tell you once I'm home. She's fine. Mom, please hand the phone over to Dad. How are you? I'm fine, Dad. Are the formalities over? Not yet, Dad. I just quit today. Okay, we'll discuss this once you are here. Could I speak to Divya? Divya? Coming. Hello, Dad. How are you? Adi. I know that you've already decided. But I'd like to say something. Aren't we doing well for ourselves? Both of us earn. And we have our savings. Is this necessary? I don't understand the need to repeat myself every time. You know it very well. I worked all these days so that we could have a stable life. I cannot wake up each morning, head to work work like a mule, update my social media status come back and talk ill about my bosses. I have my own ideas. I want to work on them. I want to set up my own company. That is my dream. Do whatever seems right to you. I just felt the need to tell you this. You should think before you talk. I heard that you quit your job. Yes. But who told you so? I always know what's happening around. -Are you going to start your own company? -Yes. Is there a vacancy for me there? You're already working at a good organization. This is a good organization. But I've heard that the housekeeping staff has made millions in another organization. Is it true? It is true, Satish. But not every company is like that. We need to take a chance. When I look at you, I get a feeling that you'll go a long way. Let me know if there is anything I can help you with. I don't care how much you pay me. Alright, Satish. Mom. Tablets. I'll be leaving. Get some rest. Stop worrying. I don't think I'll live any longer. I might die anytime soon. Before I die... I want to have a grandchild. That is my only wish. Once that happens... I shall die in peace. That's rubbish. -You'll live for another ten years. -Ten years? You'll be fine for another twenty years. Just keep quiet. Yes. You'll be fine for another twenty years. Don't worry. -Bye. -Okay. Divya. What's the rent? 35,000 rupees. That means... around four lakh rupees per year. Yes. But I can't find a cheaper place. How many employees do you want to hire? What about the salaries? A lakh and a half. Here's what it comes up to. Which means you'll exhaust your savings within a year. Yes, but... I have no other option. I'm sure we will get an investment within a year. Is Divya aware of this? Have you taken her opinion into consideration? What would you have done, if your husband had ventured into something like this? Answer my question. You haven't changed at all. Adi, are you busy? No, go ahead. I'm listening. Tell me. I'm planning to quit my job. Why? What happened? -Any squabble with the manager? -No. I am too caught up with our lives to take care of my mother. Did she say something? No. She is suffering from within. She has nobody except me. I've already quit my job. The start-up expenses need to be taken care of. -Even if you resign-- -That's what I need to do. Why don't you change your decision? You can still do this after two years. But we don't know how long my mother will live. She wants to have a grandchild. It's been three years since we got married. We should start a family. I don't understand you. I have already resigned, Divya! I've paid an advance for the new office. You need to be supportive. I'm not demanding something that's impossible. You still have time to change your decision. But I can't agree with what you have said. This is the right time for my product. Would you have said the same thing if it were your mother? So, it's come to this? I have no answer to your hypothetical questions. So, you will not reconsider it? Please understand, Divya. Everything is alright. It was just a mild heart attack. If she takes care, she will be alright. I can't return from this point now. If you have the will, you can do it. But only if you are willing. But I am quitting my job. And I will take care of my mother in the day time. You're expecting too much out of them. Rashmi, you already know. Do you expect all of them to work sixteen hours a day? All their friends party on weekends and go on trips. But these guys work with you even on weekends. Do you know why? It's not because they won't find another job. It's because they trust you. What are you doing? The chances of conceiving are higher on these dates. Adi, she hasn't even completed her degree. Do you want a developer or a degree holder? Did you test it? A unit test has been conducted. So, what are your salary expectations? I am a paying guest. I live in the vicinity. So, something that will cover the rent is fine. Things like movies and shopping don't really interest me. Rashmi. You should be congratulating me. I've been suffering for thirty years. How mean! Stop it. Dad. Thank you, dear. Please don't mind me asking you this. Why don't you both consult a specialist? Alright. We will. Our neighbor's son-in-law is a doctor. -You can consult him-- -Why hurry? It's been-- It's already been three years since you both got married. Don't you think you need to start a family? If nothing works, we will adopt a child. That's unacceptable. Oh, come on! We are humans, after all. We need to broaden our views. Adi. There are no funds for this month's salaries. We haven't raised a purchase order for the server. Rashmi, please speak to the team. Ask them if we can hold back their salaries this month. Okay. Hi, Puni. Where are you? Please transfer two lakh rupees to my account. That's more than enough. I'll repay it soon. It will suffice. Thank you, man. Rashmi, place the purchase order for the server. I had a discussion with the team about their salaries. Shanthi. Shanthi! Don't you get it? Please hang up! Adi. Shashi's father is ill. He needs 80,000 rupees urgently. What do we do? What's the matter? I don't think the server will be here tomorrow. Yes. It will take some time. I've been working hard on that feature. And there is no hardware at my disposal. It's been a month. Shanthi, you know where the funds have been used. Who named you Shanthi? It's Shanthala, my grandmother's name. Did she resemble you? Divya, why didn't you go to bed? Where's your mobile phone? It's right here. It's dead. What's the matter? -Why weren't you available-- -Divya, I had kept my phone aside and forgotten about it. You could have at least called to check on me. -I didn't feel the need to call you. -How can anyone be this disconnected? I have a million things to worry about. I don't need to check on you all the time. What if there was an emergency? What would you have done? In case of an emergency you have the office number. You can call our mutual friends. I will be informed. Your assumptions are ridiculous. -I can't keep calling you-- -That's enough! I'm wasting my time at home. Then go find a job. Put your brain to some good use. Then you will stop having these stupid thoughts. Divya. Adi. There was a call from Ganesh's office. But he demanded 51% stake. 51% stake would make him the boss. Rashmi, what do we do? We haven't paid salaries for two months. The server purchase is still pending. For how long will we push it? Except Ganesh, no other investor has shown interest. Accept his offer. I was very rude. Adi. Listen to me. Be available. We have an appointment at the fertility clinic. I have an investor meeting on Friday. Okay. What's the occasion today? You are dressed well. You've cooked my favorite meal. I just felt like doing it. That's nice. I hope it's this special every day. I hope you come home early every day. Dinner was delicious, Divya. Adi. Can you take four days off next month? Why? Do you need a vacation? There is a temple near Mysore. Mom wants us to go worship there so that I can bear a child. That's rubbish! You have the same opinion as your mother? Do you believe in all this? My cousin had a child after visiting that place. Her husband is a scientist. -Stop it, Divya. -Are they mad? Why should we do what they did? Do it for my sake. I can do it for you. Your mother's company is driving you crazy. Go find a job first! Another six months of your mother's company and-- Tell me. What do you have to say? Do we all look like fools to you? Does my mother's last wish mean nothing to you? You are talking as if your mother is going to die tomorrow. To make her last wish come true, we might have to sacrifice all our dreams. I already have many responsibilities. And now, a child? Get one thing straight, Divya. Never bring up this topic again. It's okay if we don't have children. What me and my mother want, is nonsense to you? And what about you? I regret marrying a selfish person. Have you ever bothered to ask me about how I feel? It's always about you. I know that you don't need me anymore. I'm not going to stay here anymore. Let's meet once you get rid of your obsession over the start-up. You are free now! Nobody will question you. You may as well die inside your office! Adi. Cheer up. -You look dull. -Are you ready? So, you can go ahead with your financial investments. Let's celebrate this another day, okay. Dad, it's me. It's been a while since we spoke. Yes, Dad. I've been busy. I have some good news. Tell me. Really? No, Dad. Can you smell it? No. But the smoke choked my throat. Hold on. Speak to your mother. Shanthi? You're here at this hour? Should I respond to you here itself? Or, can I come in? Come in. What happened? Water. Tell me, what happened? The owner of the house threw me out. What did you do? Why do you always blame me? I haven't paid the rent for two months. Do you need some money? I fought with him. I can't go there again. What about tonight? I'll just leave. Stay here tonight. Celebrating alone? -Where's your wife? -She has gone to her mother's place. -Did she leave after a fight? -What fight? I'm just asking. I don't have any soft drink to offer you. Will you have some lime juice? I'll just have some of this. Don't bother. Not here. I've had the entire bottle in the past. I don't like it with water or soda. What's the matter, Abhi? What happened? I'll call you back. Shanthi. Why did you let her in, when I was not at home? And... what was the need to drink? Divya, she came home at 11:30 p.m. Moreover, I hadn't paid her salary for the last two months. Adi, either you don't know anything or you're pretending-- Do you know who Shanthi is? I don't understand what you're saying. Shanthi is Tumkur commissioner Ashok Kumar's daughter. How can you be so stupid? She was thrown out of that house because of her shenanigans. Not because she didn't pay the rent. How do you know this? My friend had called me to tell me about the party you were having at home. Strange! I'm not aware about what is happening at my own house. I really didn't know. She's been working with you for several months now. How is it possible that you know nothing about her? What did you say? Do you have Shanthi's alternate number? Okay. I will call you later. Where is your phone? I lost it day before yesterday. That's probably my sixteenth phone. I keep losing my phone. Why did you ask for it? Where did you go, the other day? That morning my father sent a car. I was off to his vacation home in Coorg. What happened? Is the commissioner Ashok Kumar your father? Yes. I hadn't spoken to him for the past three months. So when he called, I went to see him. Why did you hide it for so long? Hide what? That your father is the commissioner! Hey! It's me who works here. Why drag my father into this? Why did you upload that photograph on Facebook? I uploaded it to celebrate our investment. I hope you are aware that I am married! How is that related to the photo? Facebook is a public forum. Partying with a girl while I'm alone at home. Do you think my wife will be okay with that? What will everyone else think? It was one in the morning! Why should she not be okay with it? Doesn't your wife trust you? My cousins, Divya's relatives, my ex-colleagues are on Facebook. -What will they think? -Why should I think about all that? Did we commit a mistake? We know what the truth is. Why should we worry about what others think? What sin have I committed? People who really know you will not think otherwise. And the ones who don't, why should we even care about what they think? If one photograph makes her doubt your character, she is not a good wife. Without trust-- Not a word against my wife! You know we have done nothing wrong, so you have to apologize. Go ahead. I am not falling for this. She's the commissioner's daughter. If something happens to her -you might go to prison. -Never! Go ahead. Do it for our sake! Are you insane? I will never apologize! Get some sleep. Hey, you can spend the night here. There is no one around except the servants. No way. Adi. When will the funds come in? They should come in by next week. Adi. After these formalities are done, take a break. A vacation with Divya. I better take a break or she might break up with me. Adi. US Global Technologies has launched a product. On Forester? Rashmi, send them all home. Adi, what happened? Please tell me what the matter is. US Global has released a similar kind of product. Can't there be two products offering the same service? This company's motive is not just making money. What is the total commitment? Including the salary and arrears. We don't need to discuss this right now. How much? Around eight lakh rupees. I'm sure you will all find great jobs. Adi. Why can't we start working on a different product? Yes, sir. Let's not get disheartened so soon. We are willing to work for free. At the moment, I don't have any ideas for a new product. I don't want to waste your time and risk your careers. Did you have a word with Divya? When is she coming back? I told her to take her time. I'm heading off to my native place. You got the snacks, right? Yes. You didn't have to sell your car. -We are here for you. -Here. Too proud to ask? He doesn't want to ask for help. This guy here is his childhood friend. He only asks him. We aren't good enough for him. Just a bunch of friends from college. We don't really matter. There's a job opening that matches your skill set. Take it up. It's a long term on-site job. You can live in the US with Divya for about three years. Everything will be okay. Forget about what happened. -Let go-- -Let go of what? What should I let go of? -That's not what I meant. -Then what did you mean? Have you achieved anything in life? Have you? How dare you? "Let go!" Whatever you guys have done has been for the sake of society. Or, for your families. Stand up for yourselves! Then you will know what life is all about. I haven't failed! I made a similar product with the help of five engineers. Before I could launch my product... they launched theirs. Nobody wants to face struggle and hardship. It's only about the millions that can be earned. I thought you guys would understand. Even God cannot change my will. I will fight till I die! But I will not accept defeat and live a mediocre life. Seems like you were waiting to see me fail. You're asking me to stop living my dream. You want me to be like you guys. Let this be the last time! Don't ever give me such lame advice. I can't live a life like you, awaiting death every day. Adi. We are not as intelligent as you. I hope you know. Back in college, everyone wanted to be like you. You are unique. We are very proud to be your friends. We know that you've always made the right choice. We trust you. Go ahead and do what you think is right. We are here for you. Right? Yes. I may not have been clear about what I meant. It's the alcohol talking. Sorry, man. Leave me alone for a few days. Okay. As you wish. Goodbye. I've left my bike keys here. Take it. The liquor stores will be shut at this hour. We had no idea you would throw us out. Your parents don't seem to be around. My mother is visiting a neighbor. Dad is reading the newspaper in that room. Divya. Adi is already heartbroken. At this stage... don't try advising him. He berated me for ten minutes when I tried to advise him. Please don't do that. It doesn't seem like he will take up his old job. He may not need us. But let's not leave him alone. Goodbye. Take care. Adi. Did you have to come all the way on your bike? I was missing you, so I just came. Where is Divya? She is at her mother's place. You should've brought her along. You already know that her mother is ill. Alright. It's been ages! Your skin seems to have tanned. Mom! Where's Dad? He is attending a wedding. He will not be home early. That's the way it is. Go take a shower. Let me cook something for you. Alright. Adi. How are you? Dad, I am fine. Listen to me. Look into my eyes and tell me that you are okay. I know you are not okay. Dad. Dad, I am tired. Adi. Sit down. Sit down. Just relax. Adi. I wanted to have a discussion with you. But it was never the right time. 31 years. Time has flown by, rather quickly. But let's talk about it today. I hope you know this. I had my own aspirations in life. I didn't know that. When I used to dissect frogs back in college, the entire college would come to witness it. The head of the department told me this. I was ecstatic. I finished my intermediate classes and became a medical student. But like they say, life is unpredictable. I faced failure, just like you. My father passed away. I had to take on the domestic responsibilities. I was a medical student. A government job awaited me. The government job. I had to choose. I had to take care of the family. So, I took up the government job. And the students who had scored less than me... pursued medical studies. Whereas, I... I was doing a confounding clerical job. A man who wanted to be a doctor... ended up as a clerk. My sister got engaged. Eight days before her wedding... her in-laws laid down a condition. If my sister's wedding were to take place... I had to marry a girl from their family. I was a mere twenty-one year old. Too young to be married. But... my relatives... forced me. And that's how I got married. But I don't regret that. Even if I had looked for a bride... I wouldn't have gotten a better wife than your mother. You were born a year into our marriage. I was tired of the clerical job. When my brainless superiors would berate me... I would feel like running away. I also felt suicidal. But when I used to get home... one look at your innocent face and... I would feel that it was all worth it. Now tell me, Adi. Am I... a failure in life? Tell me. Our generation had a different mind-set. We were ready to sacrifice everything. Save what we had, to see our children flourish. We rejoiced when our children prospered. But the times have changed now. Now, only materialistic success matters. I'm sure you think... that you should own a firm, provide jobs to hundreds of people, own huge cars and bungalows, and travel around the world. That's success to you. Is this life? Adi, here's what I think. These are mere materialistic achievements. Success is when we understand others. When we sacrifice something for others. When we live for others. We should love others. Sometimes... we decide to tread a particular path. At other times... God decides the path we have to take. We should tread on that path joyously. That's the real meaning of success. That's when you are truly accomplished. Let bygones be bygones. Consider the future. Okay, Dad. I have spoken all at once. It's already very late, get some sleep. -Okay. -Will you sleep here, or downstairs? I will sleep here tonight. Sleep well, son. Dad. What is it? Dad. I am at my native place. Adi, have some tea. Where is Sanvi? She's playing with her grandmother downstairs. Adi. We should think about Sanvi. What's there to think about? I'll get her here. Your wife is pregnant. So? Don't people have three kids? I am here, guys. I'll adopt Sanvi. Adi, you are already facing a lot of issues. Think this through. I respect your decision. I am also quite sympathetic towards Sanvi. But this is not a decision we can take emotionally. Be clear, Divya. I am not ready to be Sanvi's mother. Can I ask you why? This is not a sympathetic or an emotional decision. Adopting a child is a huge responsibility. Tell me what the actual reason is. I want to have our own child. Okay. I am leaving now. Adi, what happened? Did you understand what I just said? I hope you are not upset with me. Punith and I were childhood friends. I don't have to explain my friendship or my actions concerning Sanvi. And yet, I want to tell you this. If we had a child like Sanvi... and if something had gone amiss... Punith would have done much more than what I have decided to do. Bye. I am happy. Sanvi Punith. It's your father's birthday, but I have a gift for you. What's inside? You'll know when you open it. Okay. Grand celebrations? Abhi and Sid are going to be here. That's it. How's Divya? You haven't been in touch with her after the divorce? I could have. But I haven't. She is fine. She is still trying to have a child. Today we should do something crazy! Mini, it's you! It's okay if you don't have six-packs. But, will you marry me? Stop kidding! It's too late. I am managing to get by, somehow. Don't hug me in front of my wife. It's not wrong to follow your dreams. What about your dreams, Adi? Sometimes the responsibilities are more important than our dreams. That's exactly why I kept tolerating your nonsense. Our decisions affect the ones we love and change their life's direction. That guilt is extremely daunting. What happened? Adi's life! C'mon, Susheela. Humans are selfish. We think that we sacrifice our hopes and dreams for the sake of our children. But... we are selfish as well. We want our children to care for us when we are old. But... look at what Adi is doing. Your son is doing something extraordinary! You should rejoice. You should be happy. My ambitions have found a new path.
