Fairy flies on a rainy night Riding the misty waves of the Milky Way Beauties get drunk and flush Dancing and singing tirelessly Fantastic Hey, look A flying fairy Look there Dear guests Look there Cast money right now A flying fairy It’s a flying fairy Flying Apsaras Flying Apsaras is to kill me Flying Apsaras is to kill me No poisoning The cause of death is not questionable Did this man also work with Yungefang He is the chief trainer of Yungefang Diao Sanye Who fell into the Mirror Lake and got drowned seven days ago The cause of death is not questionable Yes Keep away from her I’m wondering Why they smiled Before death How can I know I am responsible for autopsy only. I am not a spirit rapper Hand it to your superior Mr. Jiang Cause of death unquestionable Death from an accidental fall Everyone This way please Months ago One night Lord of Yan State Suddenly dreamed a flying Apsaras An auspicious sign As expected In order to commend his meritorious military service The emperor issued an edict To have a shrine of remembrance built The Lord of Yan State invited a painter with a high payment To paint a mural of flying Apsaras Unexpectedly Three months have passed But the mural has not been completed Until one rainy night seven days ago On the wall of the Flying Apsaras Hall of the shrine Suddenly appeared a mural of flying Apsaras That night Some witnessed Diao Sanye, the chief trainer of Yungefang Humming a tune at a pavilion near the lake Suddenly jump into the lake My poor Piaopiao You have stayed by my side since your childhood For so many years You have gone through all sorts of ordeal Why did you die suddenly Next month The Shrine of Remembrance will be completed The Lord of Yan will invite you to dance in his banquet How should I explain it to him Sir You should help us I am going to die I am going to die Qiuniang How can you make sure that The gossip is not true You short lived little hoof What nonsense you are saying Let me tell all of you If Yungefang were to be shut All of you will have a hard time Excuse me, girl May I ask Your name Li Luoyu You are also a dancing girl of Yungefang How did you get along with Yun Piaopiao Our relationship was not good If there were only a person in Yungefang To hate Yun Piaopiao That must be me Because before she became popular Depending on the music of Flying Fairy I had been the most popular dancer in Yungefang You are honest Sir Even if I did not tell you this You would find it out if you were careful I have one more question What does the sentence you spoke to Qiuniang mean Sir Do you believe that The behaviors and conduct of everyone Are being observed by the heaven Yes, I think so You mean You also believe that The Flying Apsaras can claim one’s life Sometimes one thing is beyond human’s power The heaven will do the thing instead Who are you Rude What are you doing You are an Imperial Guard Girl Come over to warm yourself Come over to warm yourself Do I need to be away for a while I began to practice martial arts at ten And joined the Imperial Guards at sixteen There’s nothing I’ve never experienced So It’s a big deal All right, all right All right You’re really Really an extraordinary woman However How could you attack me Without saying anything as we met You have stolen into the Hall of Flying Apsaras I don’t know you Of course I will take you to the Imperial Guards first I was sent here to look into the case of Yungefang My investigation here is perfectly justified But I’m wondering why A senior official of the Imperial Guards Also cared about a homicide case of the folks A dancing girl of Yungefang had died Naturally it is not our business But if someone took the chance to spread a rumour And slander an official appointed by the imperial court That would be different I have heard about it Someone said The Lord of Yan State Did not deserve the Shrine of Remembrance So The Flying Apsaras had claimed Lives of some victims The Lord of Yan State has rendered numerous military services If he did not deserve it, who deserved it If I found out who spread the rumour I would have not forgiven him easily You didn’t believe that Flying Apsaras claimed lives either Even if it were really so I would also capture one and question him about all details Senior officials Why not drink a bowl of ginger soup to dispel the coldness Have you seen the Flying Apsaras Yes, I have You are deliberately mystifying The rumour must have been fabricated by you Don’t be afraid Just tell us What you have known As long as you tell us the truth We will not make you feel awkward Three months ago I received an invitation letter from the mansion of the Lord of Yan State Asking me To paint a mural of Flying Apsaras for the Shrine of Remembrance However, however I tried I had failed to finish the mural all the time One night, it was raining heavily I passed the Hall of Flying Apsaras Suddenly I saw some light came from inside I thought that some thief must have entered the hall But as I approached the gate and looked inside The next day I heard that Diao Sanye of Yungefang Fell into the Mirror Lake and was drowned So you spread the rumour Saying that the Flying Apsaras had killed Diao Sanye No, no, I haven’t I went to Qiuniang I went to Qiuniang For what Because six characters appeared on the wall that night Whoever insults the Flying Apsaras will be killed Though the characters had just flashed I had seen them clearly So I went to persuade Qiuniang To ask Yun Piaopiao to stop performing the dance of Flying Fairy However, I was beaten and repelled by her As a result, in less than ten days ¬ The Flying Apsaras made her power felt again Yun Piaopiao also died If the remarks of He Ziwen Were utilized by someone It would harm the reputation of Lord of Yan State However at the moment The rumour of Flying Apsaras claiming lives has spread widely If you really care about Lord of Yan State You should investigate the case with me at once To appease the rumour Investigate with you Correct Nonsense You’re only an inferior officer Who has been just transferred into the capital Do you know how many gates How many palaces How many neighborhoods in Chang’an How can you boast about investigating the case Then, Miss Xie Do you dare to have a bet with me What’s the bet Let’s see who has cracked This case first in ten days If you win I will be at your disposal in the future If I win Can you give me your sword All right It’s deal Don’t follow me anymore What are you looking at Girl, can’t you change your bad habit Of pulling out your sword to fight as soon as we meet Haven’t I told you not to follow me You have wronged me As I have already arrived Let me guess Miss Xie You must be doubting that it’s Qiuniang that has spread the rumour So you come to question her But You will be disappointed Qiuniang is a businessperson Doing so is Of no good to her But why you are here Because I ran into a girl at Yungefang in daytime And I’m a bit curious about her So I come here to ask Qiuniang about her Oh Don’t misunderstand me I mean There’s no trauma She should have hung herself to death Did Qiuniang lock The doors and windows of her room in daily time Sir Qiuniang was afraid of heat in daily time Now it’s hot summer She should have opened the skylight Miss Li Have you witnessed Qiuniang hanging herself Yes I came to Qiuniang to discuss some issue But as I went inside, I saw I don’t know why Qiuniang take things too hard Bad It must be the Flying Apsaras again Stop talking nonsense, otherwise you will be taken to Imperial Guards How domineering you are, Commandant Xie Now that the cause of death has been found out I have to go now Goodbye Goodbye, Mr. Meng No wonder Miss Li is afraid Look at this room All doors and windows are tightly locked If Qiuniang had not hung herself Her life may have been claimed by Flying Apsaras Di Renjie You must also want to taste the whip of Imperial Guards As the coroner had just said Qiuniang had hang herself No more Flying Apsaras Otherwise you will be arrested right now Take it easy, Miss Xie The death of Qiuniang Was naturally not caused by Flying Apsaras However She had not hang herself As Xiao Kui said The windows of this room Were originally opened If Qiuniang wanted to commit suicide Just think about it Will a person to commit suicide Have the time to Lock all doors and windows Besides if her life Was claimed by Flying Apsaras It would be more impossible For her to Escape after locking doors and windows In this case There is only one possible explanation The murderer had locked the doors and windows on purpose To make us believe That Qiuniang had hung herself Smar But he was too clever by doing so Because it had aroused my doubt But how did the murderer Escape from the room as all Doors and windows are locked This is similar To the death of Diao Sanye and Yun Piaopiao But at present We have not found any evidence Miss Li Do you know He Ziwen No Mr. Di Mr. Di You have been busy for one day I have cooked a bowl of noodles for you Thanks, Ms. Hu Thanks for your kindness You are welcome I have worked in the kitchen of Central Judicial Office for decades It’s the first time for me To see an officer working so carefully like you If all officers were As careful as you are The folks will Have enjoyed a much better life I must fulfill my responsibility The lives of folks are also lives I cannot Allow any groundless death to happen Yes You’re correct It’s going to rain I have to collect the clothes right now Sir, enjoy your noodles All right It’s going to rain again It’s you again It seems that We’re predestined A bad destiny It is also destiny anyway Why did you follow Li Luoyu Why did you come here I have just heard that Li Luoyu will dance at the mansion of Lord of Yan State Instead of Yun Piaopiao So you doubt that the death of people of Yungefang Has something to do with her If not, why did you come She was lying Saying that she did not know He Ziwen They must have colluded Hey Don’t cause much disturbance Scream Not my fault Not my fault Really not my fault Yaohuan Yaohuan A pity Half of the bet had gone This is the only thing passed down by my father Let me try Whether I can fix it Li Luoyu Why on earth did you want to kill He Ziwen And other people of Yungefang They were not killed by me Tell the truth He was not killed by me Really What did you do at the Shrine of Remembrance How was He Ziwen killed He had committed suicide Earlier He Ziwen had a letter sent to me Asking me to find him at the Shrine of Remembrance at dusk So I went there alone He saw me Asking me not to perform the dance of Flying Fairy Otherwise I would be killed by Flying Apsaras Like Yun Piaopiao and Qiuniang And then And then he seemed to go crazy Picking up a knife Stab it into his own chest Do you think we will believe what you said What I said is true I had asked you Whether you know He Ziwen Why did you lied to me at that time Because He Ziwen was bothering me all the time I cannot get rid of him however I tried So I did not want any connection with him But why you went to see him That was because He said he knew how Qiuniang was killed So you believed The death of people like Yun Piaopiao Was caused By the dance of Flying Fairy Which caused an insult to the Flying Apsaras So they were punished But why dared you agree to Perform the dance at the mansion of Lord of Yan State Aren’t you Afraid of death Among the five vicious qualities specified in Buddhism Greed comes first Their lives were claimed by Flying Apsaras Because of their greed I am not afraid Because the dance of Flying Fairy originally belonged to me It took me half a year to Design the dance With the dance I wished to establish my reputation Unexpectedly it was snatched by Diao Sanye And offered to Yun Piaopiao Why did Diao Sanye Do so Because Yun Piaopiao was his illegitimate daughter With a prostitute Which was known to all people in Yungefang Sir, if you did not trust my words You can ask anyone Did Qiuniang know about it Yes But she didn’t mind Because she only cared about money All people in Yungefang are No more than a tool to earn money for her Be me Or Yun Piaopiao She would not mind as long as we could earn money Not long ago I made a request of redeeming myself to her Some days later Yun Piaopiao snatched the dance of Flying Fairy from me Would you believe that Qiuniang was not in collusion with Diao Sanye I am clear that Qiuniang realized that I would not stay So she wanted to make Yun Piaopiao popular as soon as possible So that she could earn money for her in place of me Do you know the man in black That had attacked you No Think about it The man wants to kill you I don’t know him You are still so stubborn You have to undergo a rough time Otherwise you won’t tell the truth Di Renjie Have you really fallen in love with her Miss Xie In handling a case I depend on evidence Rather than torture Where are you going I will hunt for the evidence Do you know the man in black That had attacked you No Miss Xie Where’s that guy That guy has escaped Luckily He only used an ordinary overpowering drug otherwise The consequence will be worse than a sleep of hours I have owed you another favor A second one Do you keep a clear account with everyone With you only All right Let’s go Now you have awakened Get down to business You should have not come here You should have not come here Go Let’s leave here first Unnecessary We know each other Today However you try You cannot escape from here So give up struggle Meng Shaobai How do you know it’s me On the day when Qiuniang died Did you remember what Li Luoyu Addressed you Goodbye, Mr. Meng Li Luoyu is not a staffer of the Central Judicial Office You’ve never been to Yungefang How did she know your surname For this reason At that time I felt that You should have known each other before But You tried to hide that deliberately Afterward When interrogating Li Luoyu She touched her bracelet unconsciously all the time When one is nervous Usually he will try to find Some reliance So I guess The bracelet must be from A person whom she Trusts and relies on most What can be used to carry our love Only the pair of bracelets on my hands Correct This bracelet is really a token of love from me That’s why you have transferred all guards today Waiting for me to fall into your net You are a smart guy But you cannot Avoid the chaos when you are concerned Why did you kill Yun Piaopiao and other people Senior officers They were killed by me alone Shaobai simply wanted to rescue me I beg you to let him go Luoyu This has nothing to do with her I had killed them all I admit my guilt Shaobai Don’t you think you can bluff it out You are a pair of accomplice Both of you are guilty Di Renjie Though we have got acquainted for a short time I know you will tell black from white Indeed Luoyu had resentment towards the four victims But we had agreed that After saving enough money, I would redeem her And we will go away to another place All the past will be forgotten like fleeting cloud It’s not necessary for her to Kill them at this critical moment Was the man in black That attacked us at the Shrine of Remembrance you Correct It was me Was the man to Kill Miss Xie in the woods You too No After you arrested Luoyu into the jail I was thinking of how to rescue her I had not any intention to kill Miss Xie Of what you have said What is true What is false I will figure it out naturally But for now You have to be put under custody together If you trust me You should wait until I find out the truth Before that do not act rashly Okay You’ve made a progress This time you have not pulled out your sword at once Do you believe that they are the culprit You really have progressed Now you have used your brain I am not as smart as you Neither am I as good at settling cases as you But I am also clear that They confessed guilt Simply to protect each other Besides, the man in black I fought with in the woods Seemed to be a different guy from the one We met at the Shrine of Remembrance that night There are still many puzzles to solve in this case What’s your plan If we have reached the end of a path We may Return to the start And take the path all over again The start you said Refers to these bodies You’re doubting that Meng Shaobai had played a trick At the time of autopsy Do you still remember the hidden weapon Used by the man in black in the woods I am wondering If the needle Were shot into human body Will it Vanish instantly too If the man in black is the culprit The needle must be the weapon No wonder we cannot find other traces In these bodies Got it But this is not life-gate With this small needle It seems unable to claim a life I remember the entire needle is blood-red Will it be stained with poison Like the past There is no trace of getting poisoned Would Meng Shaobai Have played a trick on the corpses Trick Have played a trick on the corpses Weird Look at the four bodies The body of Diao Sanye Has been placed here for nearly a month It remains not different from that of He Ziwen Now It’s hot summer Even if cooled with ices It would have been impossible For the bodies to remain unrotten for so long Look out Got it This kind of poison is known as Smiling with a Flower Whoever is poisoned His body will remain lifelike and unrotten for months If I could not accompany You in the future Promise me You will live on well Don’t worry I will protect you Mr. Di I have found out the real cause of death of the four victims Have you heard of a poison Called Smiling with a Flower So You’re doubting that I have applied the poison Have you applied it No Nor Luoyu I also wish so There are limited medical records about the drug I cannot find out who has applied the drug Therefore I will go to Five Poison Valley with Miss Xie To learn from the poison expert there Wait until I come back If I can prove that you and Miss Li are innocent At that time I will pick you in person Out of the jail All right I will wait for you Hey Are you satisfied with it So you call me here, simply to give it to me To be honest It has taken a lot of my effort Luckily it was fixed on time In this trip to the Five Poison Valley You must have a weapon in your hand Fire Fire Quickly, this way Hurry up Water, water Quickly Have you had meal Sir Except for Meng Shaobai and Li Luoyu All people have been rescued What are you going to do I will go in with you No, you must stay here I also want to enter No, it’s an order What if something wrong happens to you Di Renjie Take care Xiao Bai Hurry up Go Rescue Luoyu Let me carry her on my back Go Xiao Bai be careful Go, rescue Luoyu Xiao Bai Shao Bai Go Go Go Are you okay I am fine Xiao Bai is still inside Xiao Bai Xiao Bai Xiao Bai Sir A charred corpse was discovered in the lobby It should be Meng Shaobai Shaobai Shaobai Shaobai Shaobai Shaobai Shaobai Sorry I should have trusted you But trust me I will surely find out the culprit To revenge you Cut it Don’t simply watch Are you okay Fine Kill the leader It’s dead Who are you Master Master Master Master Master Who are you Why did you kill my master Brother You have misunderstood us We come here to see the poison expert But unexpectedly As we entered, we saw the elder lying on the floor I know You must come here to revenge on my master Is he the poison expert Whoever you are Today you have entered the Valley and entered my master You will not leave here alive You’ve really misunderstood us Listen to me Listen, I have not killed your master Cut the crap Are you fine Go Block the door Gold Wood Water Fire Earth This is an array of five elements Metal restricts wood Water flows in the opposite direction Water restricts Fire promotes earth Earth promotes gold The three elements restrict each other Those three elements promote each other The earth position at the middle Should be the gate of death I cannot find the switch Look Which direction it is gazing at The bed Dare to have a bet with me Are you fine Don’t worry, I won’t die Poison House It was said that Poison House is where The classics of poisons was collected And where he was refining poison I’ve not expected That it is in this place How did you know The switch was installed in the bed That room and this place Are arranged following the Trigram of five elements As long as we followed the direction of eight gates We would naturally find The position of the gate of life Come here Sit down This is the Poison Valley There must be some antidote to the snake poison Wait for me I will search for the antidote Got it Search for them Yes When you were in coma, I found this Record of the poison Smiling with a Flower Smiling with a Flower Is a powerful poison passed down by Guanzhong Cangmen From generation to generation without being disclosed But the clan of Cangmen were wiped out By their foes overnight twenty years ago None of the clan had survived From then on The poison had disappeared That’s to say The clue is broken again We have made so much effort And risked our life But we got nothing in the end Not necessarily so Mr. Di She deserves the title of No. 1 dancing girl in the capital She is unrivalled by Yun Piaopiao I remember Xiao Kui said Though Yun Piao had snatched the dance of Flying Fairy But she could not Perform many of the movements Look This movement Yun Piaopiao could not perform it at all What do you want to express Greeting to two officers We have just come back from the Poison Valley And come to see you by the way Have you found out anything We have found The poison expert had died We were almost taken as The culprit Luckily his disciple Trusted the sign of Central Justice Office I promised to find out the culprit for them So they agreed to let us go It’s a pity That we have not got any useful information Miss Li Do you really want to go to perform at the mansion of Lord of Yan State I know what you’re worried about But I am convinced that I will be lucky Besides Hundreds of employees of Yungefang Have to earn their living I must go Don’t worry I’ve promised Xiao Bai To protect your safety Thank you, Mr. Di Your performance just now Is really amazing The movement of Flying Fairy picking star Cannot be accomplished without A foundation of decades Mr. Di, you have flattered me My performance is simply some insignificant skill It’s not worth mentioning All right I have still some business to handle We have to go now Goodbye, sir Flying Apsaras has show her presence And will claim lives again Flying Apsaras has shown her presence And will claim lives again Diao Sanye Has been drowned to death, do you still remember it Yes, yes Plus him, this is already the fourth victim It’s said that The Flying Apsaras After killing four victims in succession Showed her presence again last night You guess This time I think, she is nothing weird Perhaps we have guessed it wrong Because she appeared nothing weird That is more weird How is my work compared with yours You are really smart You’ve deceived everyone with only a cloaking trick It’s a pity that The flaw has spot by me The so-called presence of Flying Apsaras is simply a painting of Flying Apsaras Outlined on the wall in advance And then covered with honey When it’s needed You simply put ants Onto the honey After the honey is eaten up by the ants The painting of Flying Apsaras will Appear instantly And you Have mixed chronic poison in the hone After the antis eat up the honey They will die In fact This is just a small trick Simply taking advantage of the fear of people So the trick has not been revealed all the time Today I create my work In the same way Are you satisfied with it Miss Li It’s really you I should have known that this is a pitfall But I It’s simply because You are too confide You don’t believe that Your trick will be revealed So Upon hearing that the Flying Apsaras made her presence felt again You will surely come and look I should have killed you Who are you Now that you have known me Why ask me this question Twenty years ago When the clan of Cangmen was wiped out Where were you That night Cangmen was in flames Screams were echoing in the air Cangmen people tried to fight against the foes But they failed I was heavily injured and fainted out So I survived the disaster When I awoke Cangmen had been wiped out You used this to Kill Yun Piaopiao and other victims Greed is terrible I have worked hard for Yungefang for so many years Qiuniang had acted in collusion with Yun Piaopiao and Diao Sanye To snatch my dance Didn’t they deserve death But now that you decided to leave Yungefang Why did you have to bother yourself about it Redeeming myself Why had I not left all the time After Qiuniang heard about my idea of redeeming mysel She gave a high price of one thousand taels The saving of me and Shaobai was far from enou So she let Yun Piaopiao snatch my dance So that I would never be able to Redeem myself Now that they could not fulfill my request I would not forgive them If greedy guys like them Were not eliminated by the heaven Then I would enforce justice on behalf of the Heaven Diao Sanye was mean Who kept bullying dancing girls in daily time With an excuse of training He had stolen my dance So I killed him firs Yun Piaopiao Was frivolous and fished for fame and gains She liked the dance of Flying Fairy so muc So I fulfilled her dream And let her die at her most beautiful moment Qiuniang should have not died But she would rather offend Lord of Yan State Than let me dance in place of Yun Piaopiao Considering our affection for so many years I offered her a decent death How about He Ziwen Why did you kill him Because He was also Part of the trap of Flying Apsaras claiming lives He Ziwen was simply an idiot Who knew nothing except for painting As I seduced him a bit He was willing to sacrifice himself for me You had taught him to Create a false scene of Flying Apsaras making her presence felt Everything was originally fine It’s a pity that he was as greedy as Other people He said he wanted to marry me And with it as a threa I had no option but kill him to clear the evidence How about Meng Shaobai You really love him But why did you kill him too It was an accident That day I heard your dialogue with Shaobai Knowing that you had found out Smiling with a Flower A long delay may cause much trouble So I set the jail on fire To make you believe that The culprit was to kill us as scapegoat But I had not expected Shaobai If Shaobai were still alive And knew that you are so cruel He must Be very sad He had fallen in love with a wrong person Mr. Di I know that I am sinful I have nothing to care about in this world But Shaobai Would you please tell Shaobai If there were an afterlife I would meet him innocently Li Luoyu Li Luoyu Xiao Bai Do you think that you’ve loved a wrong girl Mr. Di Mr. Jiang said Now that the case of Yungefang had been settled He asked us to return the bodies Who tell you that the case has been settled You can go now I will explain it to Mr. Jiang Mr. Jiang asked us to wrap up and bury The body that was drowned in a lake Sir The body of the man who was drowned cannot be found Do you know where it is No Why is the body missing When have you seen the body recently It seems On the day when the jail was on fire We have not paid attention to the bodies since then Li Luoyu I know who you are protecting Shaobai If Li Luoyu really love you How would she allow your tomb to Be filled with weeds What They were killed by the poison Smiling with a Flower Dad, you’ve also heard of the poison I heard of it when I was fighting in the expedition I disdained those who used poison most So I have just heard of it The culprit produced poisonous needles with toxic blood and ice After the needle entered the body The ice smelted So the coroner had failed to find out the scar and trace of getting poisoned That is too cruel By the way Has the person that applied the poison really died yes She had committed suicide in front Of me and Di Renjie That’s fine A cruel person will Bring more disasters if remaining alive Dad Can you tell me again How my dad was killed Why do you ask this again I was small when my dad passed away As to the death of my mother My knowledge was also limited Recently I have often dreamed of my father So I cannot help asking it That year your dad went on an expedition with me And fell into a trap of the enemy In order to save me He was killed by an arrow I remember that when my dad was killed The army had won a victory and Was ready to come back Yes On the way back We fell into a pitfall of the enemy I had to be blamed for my pride Yaohuan I owed you the life of your father Dad, you are too serious I am to blame For mentioning the past I have more work to do at the Imperial Guards I have to go now Go ahead That guy is easy to identify On his right hand are six fingers Indeed Miss Xie Ms. Hu When will Di Renjie come back I don’t know Besides Mr. Di will not tell me This when he went out Girl Don’t worry It has got dark now He will come back soon You don’t know Where to find him Today I have stewed some chicken soup in the kitchen I have served one bowl for you Drink it when it is hot And wait for him slowly Enjoy it while it’s hot It will taste bad when it gets cold Thanks, Ms. Hu You are welcome Miss Xie went out in the morning And has not come back After she came back Would you tell her Di Renjie had come to her for some urgent issue Yaohuan is not in the Imperial Guards Nor in the mansion of Lord of Yan State She may have gone to my place Mr. Di Sir It’s late at night I have boiled a cup of ginseng tea After finishing it Go to bed early All right, thanks, Ms. Hu You’re welcome Drink it while it is hot By the way, Ms. Hu Has Miss Xie come here today I’ve been in the kitchen all the time I have not seen her Sir, drink it while it is hot, it is good for your stomach Di Renjie However smart you are In the end You have fallen into my hand Who are you You need not Know it But don’t worry I will not claim your life As long as you stay here Quietly for some days I will let you go It is not that easy, is it Will you let me go easily if I unveil your plot of Flying Apsaras I have misjudged your ability If I did not guess it wrong You should have been the person with an attempt to kill Miss Xie in the woods Those who had survived The disaster of Cangmen twenty years ago And Yun Piaopiao All victims were killed by you with poison Li Luoyu Was only a scapegoat of you It appears That I must kill you Why are you Still supporting you at this moment I have made the right friend Xiao Bai We have not seen each other for a long time I have known that I cannot conceal it from you At that time when you was engulfed in flames Li Luoyu was sorrowful Her sorrow at that time was real But days later When I saw her again She tried to suppress her tears But In her eyes There was no sorrow of losing a beloved She loves you so deeply She will not pay a blind eye to The weeds That grew at your tomb Not until a corpse Was missing at the morgue Had I realize That some fraud had been practiced The various behaviors of Luoyu All indicate that She was clear that you had not died I had not expected you to investigate Luoyu Nor had I expected that You would find out the death of Yun Piaopiao and other victims The flame Was set to clear the charges against me and Luoyu But I had not expected you To rush into the fire to rescue me That’s because I have really treated you as my brother So I will not kill you But you will not be allowed to spoil our plan What on earth you want to do Shaobai Save nonsense to him This guy Must be killed today Mother I beg you We have killed enough people Let’s spare him Shaobai, go away Mother Impossible I have added Some powder into the tea I have not Drunk the tea You said you had not seen Miss Xie But there was her fragrance in your sleeve You appeared old But your fingers are still tender Your skin is as glossy as cream You are much younger than your age So I pretended to drink the tea Simply to see what was your plot All right You are really Di Renjie No wonder My son Shaobai Is trying to protect you Smiling with a Flower Is indeed a magical poison in the world Which can keep one young forever So what Even if time has left no trace My heart has been scarred and battered What’s to blame is that you are too smart You are not my rival Follow me back to the Central Judicial Office Commit no more mistakes Impossible What are waiting Do you want to see me killed by him Mother Di Renjie If you fight anymore I will kill her Mother I beg you not to kill any more people After we finish our revenge tomorrow We will escape to another place They are helpless with us Many victims have been killed So what When 107 people of Cangmen were killed Why no one had come to save us But they are innocent If you really want to kill more people You can kill me too I have died once You Guard them Xiao Bai You are holding the candle to the devil Think about Miss Li She had died as a scapegoat of your mother If you had not kept investigating the case How could she be involved It is my duty To investigate cases and find out the culprit You should be clear of This point Xiao Bai However great The hatred And grievance you and your mother are suffering You should have not harmed innocent people Innocent But in this world Who is really innocent When the whole family of my mother was killed When she witnessed her parents and families killed in front of her Luoyu suffered all kinds of humiliation at Yungefang Aren’t they innocent But she has not intended to kill them It’s all because of you Xiao Bai What on earth do you and your mother want to do Are you going to assassinate Lord of Yan State How do you know Twenty years ago, the clan of Cangmen was wiped out The head was called Xie Ling He He was my father I have concealed it from you all the time At the Poison House Other than the classics of poison I also discovered the truth behind The Cangmen disaster twenty years ago At that time Lord of Yan State was only a general My dad was his bosom friend My dad should have wiped out Cangmen Under an order from Lord of Yan State That brute Meng Shaobai If your mother really wants to kill Lord of Yan State You must stop her I have been around Lord of Yan State for many years Your mother is not a rival of him My mother has waited for this day for twenty years However powerful he is He will not escape his doom this time Come on Hang the plaque Love live our great majesty All of you remain outside the Shrine of Remembrance I will pay respect here To pray for the emperor None of you are allowed to disturb me Yes Wen Zhi’an Do you remember me Who are

should have died In the hand of my husband You want to revenge Come As the lord of a state With glorious meritorious military services I have killed numerous people on the battlefield Not to say the hundreds of lives of Cangmen Even all souls who had been killed by me came to me today I will not be scared That year for marrying the princess and promotion to a higher position You were cruel enough to send some soldiers to kill your wife and son You must have not expected That one day you will receive revenge What’s my fault Everyone lives for himself Why didn’t you refuse to leave my home You had forced me Twenty years have passed Father and mother Now I can finally revenge you You want to harm me with this small trick You’ve deceived me Smiling with a Flower of Cangmen had appeared in Chang’an Did you think that I would not take any precaution I asked all soldiers to be away Simply to induce you Twenty years ago Xie Ling really betrayed me So you have survived to date That’s because he had conscience Not so cruel as you For position and wealth You had even attempted to kill your wife And your own son How can you swallow the Foods exchanged with the blood of your wife and
