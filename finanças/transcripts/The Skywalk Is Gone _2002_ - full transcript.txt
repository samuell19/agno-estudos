Mam. Don't you know it's very dangerous? I wanted to cross the street. I was to take the overpass. You can take the underpass if there's no overpass. Are you friends? No. Then why did you cross the street with her? We don't know there're other ways. I always take the overpass. But you should take the underpass if there is no overpass. - Come on, your ID cards please. - Where do I go for the underpass? - Your ID card please. - I didn't mean to do it. Well, it's all right. Give me your ID and I'll tell you, okay? Your ID cards please. Both of you. Why ID card? - I did nothing but crossing the street. - But you have violated traffic regulations. That's because there is no overpass. Not my fault. I'm willing to take the overpass. You broke the rules. Both of you. - An underpass is just over there. - What do you mean by "breaking the rules"? How come the overpass is gone? - Well, that's none of my business. - Then that's none of my business either. - But you should take the underpass. - I was just crossing the street. You should take the underpass. Stop! Your ID card, please. I didn't mean it. Come on. That makes no difference. Well, I was to take... Hey, don't go yet. You... What? - I haven't got this settled yet... - Settled? I was just crossing. - The overpass is gone. You can't blame me! - But you broke the rules. - You broke the rules. - What do you mean by that? - There is no overpass but there is an underpass. - I don't know where it is. Don't you understand? - You are a freak. - Why not asking? - Ask whom? - Any one. There are so many people there. - You're being unreasonable! - You can't cross the street like that. - Now, what on earth do you want? - To the hell with it! Give me... I want nothing else. Just give me your ID. - I don't know. I don't have the ID. - Of course you do. If not, how can you prove your identify? - Why should I prove it? - Because I need to know where you're from... - Excuse me, sir. When was the overpass torn down? - I don't know. No idea. - Do you know the vender of watches on the overpass? - I haven't a clue. That makes no sense. Hurry up. Give me your ID. I told you I don't have one. Don't you understand my words? If you're behaving like this, how can we get things settled? How do I know whether you're Taiwanese or not? Can't you understand my Mandarin? People from China speak Mandarin very well too. Like me? There used to be an overpass here. Hey, you. Give me your ID card, please. My I take your order? Coffee, please. I'm sorry. We don't serve coffee today. - Why? - Because of water rationing. - Then what else do you serve anyway? - Fried rice with egg. - Is it served with soup? - No. Could I have a look at the menu? These are not available. Give me fried rice with egg. Excuse me, sir! ...my ID card... you didn't give my ID card back to me. Yes, I gave it back to you. No. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. Have you looked over? I couldn't find it. Your ticket... I returned it to you with the ticket. Look again. Could you look in the bag as well? It could be there. No, it's not here. Try to look carefully again. It's not in my pocket or anywhere else. Sir! Excuse me. I'm afraid you didn't give it back to me when arguing with that lady. I did give it back to you. Could you have put it somewhere else? Take your clothes off. Let's have a look. Where? Okay. Over there. Take off your pants as well. The underwear, too. Turn around. Put down your hands. What did you do for a living? I sold watches on the overpass. How did you get the scar? This? I had an operation for dislocation. Do you like watching porn movies? Of which country? The United States. Is it easy to get your cock erect? Can you do it now? Now? Can you do it? I think so... Yeah. Try now. Try? Use your imagination. Kinda weird. Close your eyes and imagine. Can I do it in the toilet? Well, now put that on. That, the doctor's robe over there. Put it on. With the stethoscope. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Okay, come out. Go over there. I rushed into the woods Where there were numerous trees. I couldn't find his trail But saw the trees in the breeze. I rushed through the woods Where there were numerous trees. I couldn't find his trail But heard the Nanping Bell. The sound of the Nanping Bell Spread by the breeze, Was ringing the bell in my heart. The sound of the Nanping Bell Spread by the breeze, Woke me from the dream of lovesickness. It woke me from the dream of lovesickness. Lovesickness in vain. As I walked out of the forest, I saw the beautiful sunset again.
