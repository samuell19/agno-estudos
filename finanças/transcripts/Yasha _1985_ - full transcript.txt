DEMON Ya s h a KEN TAKAKURA YUKO TANAKA KUNIE TANAKA TAKESHI KITANO AYUMI ISHIDA Screenplay by TSUTOMU NAKAMURA Photography by DAISAKU KIMURA Art Director TSUTOMU IMAMURA Music by MASAHIKO SATO TOOTS THIELMANS Directed by YASUO FURUHATA What're those two up to? Keita's upset about his son. Yeah? It'll end in a fight. They've been good friends for years. Hideo's spoilt that friendship. Too bad. Shuji. I want to talk. About my son, Hideo... thanks. So you understand? Isn't she beautiful? Where is she going? Hiroshi. Hiroshi. This is the sea. Grow up to be as big and strong as the sea. What's the name? "Hotaru." Meaning a firefly? That's right. This is a firefly. It glows to attract hungry fishermen. Taro, supper's ready. I'm coming. I'll take a bath. No. I'm dirty. Daddy's taking it. Later, then. Taro, give this to Granny. You know what "Hotaru" is? "Hotaru?" It's... It's... It's a firefly. No, a drinking house. Fisherman will go there. It's hot. It won't last a year. Okyo, Kiku, Shinobu... They all failed. They're talking about it. Hello. Hi! Have a seat. Keita, have a drink. Keep it for yourself. Keita, any letter from your son? Not yet. He's only been in Tokyo a few days. I don't want to be a fisherman. Be quiet. You bring him up to make his own choices. Kids must go out to see the world. What a good father you are. Are you thinking of going as well? Shuji, there it is. The Hotaru. Youngsters, go home. We're here! What's the big idea starting without us? You're always late, Keita! Two, when you're ready. You don't come here often. You should come more frequently. Listen! It's time to pick a place for the excursion. A hot spring resort. It's nice in the winter. Shuji. Will you come? Shuji. Why don't you come with us this year? Join us once in a while. Thank you. What's your name? It's Keiko. It means "Little Firefly." Nice name. But why come to a small town like this? Tsuruga's bigger. Shinobu sold it to me. You know her? We worked together. She told me you paid her only twice a year, January and July. That's why she went bankrupt. I'm not intending to follow her example. January and July. Fishermen's paydays. No credit. That's the rule of the house. You've got to make allowances. It must have cost a lot to fix this place. Hey, carpenter! How much? It was a bargain: very little considering. You always say that. Not that music. It gives me a pain in the ass. Let's go home. Pay your bills. No credit. No. No credit! Pay me now! No credit! I'll pay your bills. Drink on me! Take it! Great, Keita! You can hear it better, yes? 'Morning. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! What a haul! Keita's late. The sea is getting rough. We must work even in a storm. We're poor. I hear my husband played being Mr. Big last night. At the Hotaru. Right? I don't know. He should know he's not handsome. But everyone likes him. Something you should know. Yes? Your man gave that Hotaru woman a big fish a while ago. That's all. Tora! Tora! Tora! Keita needs... nitro... nitro... Nitro? Doesn't he have it? He'll have a heart attack without it. He's gone to Ainu Beach. Come in, Nagakiko-maru! This is Union Headquarters. Do you read me? Come in, Nagahiko-maru! This is Union Headquarters... Take me with you. Calm down, woman! Can't sail in this storm. But Keita... Cross the mountain. Shuji. Please save him! Keita! Your pills! I want to send my daughter to university. I need a lot of money. I have to put in the hours. She's still little. Not for long. You won't be able to help her if you're dead. Shuji... are you angry? Thanks. I almost gave up. Hideo was your right arm. Forget it. I never included him in my calculations. Was it heart attack? Go to a hospital. Eh? Okay? How's Keita? Nothing serious. He's well enough to go to the Hotaru. My man goes there, too. All the men in town go there, not to Tsuruga anymore. That woman will suck them dry. You watch out. She's more than a flirt. She's not just a proprietress. She's a man trap. What was she? A bar hostess, of course. She's from the South, Osaka. Really? Shall we go? Ready. You too, Fuyuko. Osaka. That's true. That's true. Here we are. Thank you. I'll have my lunch here. Umm... Aren't I buying you lunch. I wasn't intending to come here alone. She thought you were after her, huh? Everybody told me the South District of Osaka is dangerous. I don't really know. Try this. You can start work tomorrow. Thank you. Goodbye. Come back soon. Thank you. Goodbye. Fuyuko. He's nice. I like him. But he's a gangster. Don't forget it. Isn't this your sister? Is it her? Brother... Don't show your body in public. That's how you can live in a town of fishermen. That's how. Be a good fisherman. The tattoo on your back won't affect your fishing. A hyena with a conscience is no longer a hyena. It becomes a cat. Shuji, be a proper fisherman. The 9:55 express train from Osaka is arriving. The 9:55 train from Osaka is arriving... Don't leave anything behind... Thank you. Hey. Hmm? Got a light? A nice place, eh? Where's that? So-so. You can make a new start here. Beautiful scenery to look at, delicious fish to eat... Away from Osaka, away from gangsters... you can become a different person. This is your chance. Your last chance. You giving me orders? It's not that. Because I want to be here with you. That's why I'm here. I'll support you. You don't have to work. So please keep yourself straight. You're going to support me? In this town? It's tiny... and it's cold. You can't make it here! They're only fishermen. It's easy. Leave it to me. Mum! Go away. Go away, you brat! Hiroshi, keep to the pavement. Take care. Who's his father? What does it matter? He's my son. That's what counts. I don't like it. I'm not asking you to be his father. Listen... I think I'm pregnant. It's your child. He's a travelling gambler. I won about twenty thousand yen last night. Right? About that much. I won thirty-seven. We beat the professional gambler. Draw! Yajima! That's a hell of a losing streak! One more game. We're late! Hey! Don't let mah-jong spoil things for you. We had plenty of time! No. I'm lucky tonight. Shop! Let's play mah-jong. Come on! All night again? I'm tired. Shuji warned us. I was financially embarrassed. Not when you won 20,000 yen. You're tough, Yajima. You've been awake for seven nights. Do you get it up with your wife, too? You're a tough guy! That's because... I take vitamin shots. We certainly do! It's really good stuff. It really works. What's that? A secret. What's is it? Tell us. This way! This way! Shuji! Give us a lift, Shuji. The next bus won't come for an hour. Do me a favour. How's my old man? Fine. What's up? Come home when you're a success. But I hear he's sick. So I... Leaving home isn't a game. Don't worry. Go back. Stick with your job. Got it? I'll take you. Never mind. I'll go alone. Let's go. Thanks, Yajima. Hey! Beer! C'mon! All right. I'm on a winning streak! Okay. Yajima always pays his debts. Service here. Have a drink. C'mon drink up! Help me make up my loss. I'm waiting. Hang on. Welcome. Shuji, been to the market? Have a drink. I can't work the sea, so I earn here. He beat me. Listen. I want to talk. Don't involve the fishermen in gambling anymore. Don't make them stay awake. They can't work during the day. Shuji. Why are you whispering? Come here. What?! Are you telling us what to do? Hey... Drink. Let's drink. I wondered what was happening. I'm sorry. Here, use this. I'm okay. I'm okay. Please... Excuse me. Is he okay? Are you still taking it? You said you'd quit. Shut up. You promised you wouldn't do it again. Shut up! Mum! You promised! Don't do that! Don't! We've got to help! What'll we do? Just a lovers' quarrel. Keita. Leave them be. This'll help. What's this? Answer me! Why? Why? Did you enjoy that? You said, "You're my only kin." "I love you." Liar! You're a gangster. And I'm a gangster's sister. Thank you. Let me. How's your stud? Not stud. He's my beau. We'll make wedding gowns before graduation. I'll wear it on my wedding day. Brother! Brother! Thief! Stop them! Stop! Stop them! Damn you! Brother... eat. It's yours. Here. Eat it. Morning. Back from work? I'm going to work, too. Shuji. Let's go to the Tsuruga Market. Sure. Look here! Tora! Doesn't it look great? Take your medication. Of course. Kato! Aki! Follow me today. Come on! I'm no fool. Good morning. Fine day. Yes. Hey. Hey. You look fine. I am fine. I think I can work. First time in weeks. Are you taking heroine? Heroine? Right. I don't understand. Do the others do drugs, too? I'm free to associate with Yajima. None of your concern. Does he get it from Osaka? Tell me... How do you know a guy can get heroine in Osaka? It's not something ordinary people know. Do they? Let me go. The fish won't wait all day. Leave me alone. Come again. Sure. Toshio. Brother! Hello. How are you? Been a long time. Toshio. What's come over you? Your hard right... You haven't changed a bit. Good old Yasha. You're wrong. What's Yajima to you? Yajima? Tell me everything. Don't try to hide anything. Drug dealing. Right? He said he'd make a fortune by selling it to the fishermen. He's setting them up. Mah-jong is the bait. He may lose some, but... he'll make a lot more. So you carried it? What are you up to now? I'm with another gang. Did you know Boss Hanawa died? It was terrible. Most of his men left his gang. His wife talks about you. "Yasha was right." "What's he doing now?" With you, I'd have been a big shot. But look at me. I'm just a courier for drugs. The Express Kaga for Osaka is arriving... Goodbye, brother. Tke Express Kaga for Osaka is now waiting on Platform One. Tell me! Where did the money go? Tora! To that woman? Calm down. We need it here! Don't keep on! I earned it, didn't I? I'll get some more money. Stop it! Not before our daughter. Shame on you! Shame on YOU! That money's for her high school! No! Tora! Let me go! You dirty pig! I can't believe it! Bastard! You wasted it on the woman at the Hotaru! What have you done? What's wrong? What's happened? Look, Fuyuko. Mika's bankbook! The money's gone! Don't believe her. Calm down, Tora. There maybe another explanation... All right. I'll ask the woman. Come with me, Fuyuko. Mom! Wait! You're seducing innocent fishermen. What are you up to? Step outside. This is a fishing port. A town of fishermen. If their wives hate you, you can't live here. Being pretty means nothing. I'm talking to you. If I painted my face... I'd be prettier that you. Calm down! I'm not trying to eat them. Why does it bother you? How dare you! You'll be sorry! Your ugly face drives your man away. Try to charm him. What a bitch! Osaka makes horrible women. I must keep my man from her. Look at her horrible, cruel face! I wasn't expecting customers... after the trouble. They're not happy with you. The sign's turned off. I forgot. Yajima? He went out. Care for a beer? Have a seat? He got dope yesterday, you know. What? He keeps it somewhere. Get rid of it. So you're from Osaka, too. I will. Shuji. Thank you. What've you done? Where did you put it? Tell me. You better tell me. Chance? A chance for what? Don't! You threw it away? Where? Damn you. I'll kill you! Stop it! Stop it! Come here! Get back here! What's up? Stupid prick! Get lost! Run! Get away! Get him! Stop him! Stop! I'm here! Stop! Get help! Yasha! Yasha! Come quick! It's bad! It's Yajima. Hurry! What? Yajima? What's the matter? Yajima. What's the matter? Piss off! Let go of me! Nobu! You okay? What's happened? What's happened? Get lost! I'll kill you all! What's wrong? He's gone crazy! Keiko. Bitch. You bitch. Yajima. Yajima. What's up? Damn you. You... It's all your fault. Drop the knife. I'm going to kill you, asshole! You scumbag! You okay? It's alright. What's happening? Don't look! What's going on? Call the cops. No! No! Don't... Please don't! Shuji. You're a gangster, too. Act like one. Not like a poor fisherman. Shuji! Shuji! What a day, huh? Yes, terrible. I'm sorry. Forget it. We don't mind. We mind our own business. Where is he? He's gone. After that, he couldn't stay here. A drink? Whiskey. I'll have a beer. They say Shuji... has a tattoo on his back. Did you see it? I was surprised. It was so beautiful. A woman's face among leaves. But it's a devil... Called Yasha. Yasha? Hello. Thanks for your kind gift of cash. Don't worry. I want to talk with Yajima. We need the drugs to keep awake. Right? But he's gone. Where to? Did you see Shuji's tattoo, too? Just a glimpse. Fuyuko covered it. That explains... why he never takes his shirt off, even in summer. Keita. Did you know? No, I didn't. Isn't it strange? He's hidden it for years. Didn't you know? It's water under the bridge. It's history. The question is... With Yajima gone, how do we get the drugs? Maybe Shuji lured my man to gambling on mah-jong. Quiet! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. It's not going to do a lot for our reputation. They're lovers. His wife is pretty. She picked him up. He's a problem. Don't associate with his family. Not with Taro, their son. Mika! No, Mum. Mika. Find a boyfriend from a decent family. I'm back. Get changed. They all talked about yesterday. What made the town so noisy? The woman at the Hotaru. Why not? She's beautiful. Fool. It's hard to make a living at sea. Dad, let me see your tattoo. Someday. Promise. Gangsters have tattoos. I hate it. Hush! What's wrong with it? Welcome home, Taro. Welcome. Welcome. Why the long face? Mika said she wouldn't speak to my family. And why not? What did Father do? What harm has his tattoo done them? Don't be ashamed of it. Be proud of him! Going home? Get in. I'll walk home. You'll catch cold. Get in. Go away. Get in. Let go of me. I had a miscarriage. Yajima's child. He went away. What'll you do? Me? I don't know. Whatever will be will be. I think I'll return to Osaka in the end. I wish I could live there. It agrees with me. I like it. The car's here. Thanks. Boss. What's this? Don't be stupid. Even if you kill me, nothing will change. Fuyuko. Can he become a real fisherman? A real fisherman, body and soul. Who? Your man. What about him? His Yasha devil isn't on his back. It's in his heart. It's a horrible thing. It depends on you. Fuyuko. A good wife has to know how to control that demon. I'll have a drink. Maybe... it's best to go away. Me? No, me. When I'm with you... I feel relaxed. More than at home? Why? I don't know. But... I'm relaxed. There you are. Welcome. Sit down. How about me? Just the one. It's good. Me too? Long, long ago, in South Osaka... there was a man called Yasha. He was a big shot, but suddenly he quit. Why do you think that was? For a woman. There was a man like that. But I don't think it was for a woman. It was for the sea. He wanted to go to sea. So, I left the town and came to the sea too. Then I found... Like a movie. Isn't it? Thank you. Come again. Goodbye. Good night. How do you like it? You bought it? Shouldn't I have come? I wanted to see you. I want to be alone with you. You said you feel relaxed when you're with me. Is it true? It made me feel happy. Yasha is warm. How come you have that tattoo? How did you feel when you got it? I'm glad I came here. I can see Yasha. By the way, Fuyuko... did you wash Dad's kimono? He died fifteen years ago. Why wash his kimono now? Is that so? Is she going senile? You were beautiful that time. The day when your groom suddenly came from Osaka. Why remember it now? Your father's ship sank. We couldn't work the sea. We were at a loss. That's right. Old lady! Mother! Mother! Those fishermen are sneaky cowards. Shuji keeps quiet, but he feels it. I know. I know everything. Even if Shuji wears a tattoo on his back... What's wrong with that? Did you get laid? Did he lay you? Forget I asked you. Why not, when a man loves a woman? So it's true? Who's that? Shuji? Yes. The Hotaru. I see. Was it Shuji? I must apologize to him. I'm ashamed. Will you watch the place for me? Sure. Where are you off to? Keiko. Looks delicious. It was my mother's favorite, but she's dead. Your father's fallen asleep. Hanako, cover him. Hey. Not for kids. It was sexy. It was sexy. Your homework? I've done it. Jiro hasn't. Finish it. Then bed. Taro's studying. He isn't. He's writing a love letter. Let's see! Give it back! Read it. "My Darling Mika..." Give it back! Stop it, children! Or you're all grounded. Jiro started it... And I'm finishing it! You'll catch cold. Mum said you should've... shown the tattoo sooner. We could've lived easier. Now the whole town knows. It's better that way. You hate the tattoo? If I didn't like it, I couldn't have lived with you. Is this all? All the money I have. I wanted to live with you... in Osaka. Not enough. Unless I pay... they'll kill me. There's no way out. Keiko... help me. No. Why? You're selfish. You're no man. Why? Why, Keiko? I'm scared. Why? Keiko. Are we finished? Keiko, why? Why Keiko? Is it all over? Keiko. Keiko. Keiko. He left it out again. Taro, don't leave your bike outside. You surprised me. I didn't intend to come. It's all right. I want to talk to Shuji. I hate Fuyuko. Is it Yajima? He's back, eh? He took all my money. He said he's going to be killed. Might be another lie. Look at me. Don't turn away. Look into my eyes. Help him. Then what? I'll leave him. Can you? What did she want? Yajima... He's back, and in debt. How much? A lot. It's either one of his arms... or his life. It's that much. So? Poor Keiko! Sell your ship. If it bring in the money... If it's that much... How can we live without it? What'll you do? She asked... you want to help her? I'll go to Osaka. I... I can't settle it with money. I never have. I'll do it my way. You were a gangster. Can't you forget it? Please... Don't go! I've made my mind up. I'm your wife! I know. Why? Why die for a woman like that? We've had fifteen years... What was it all about? Can you forget those fifteen years... for her? Thank you. My husband fell ill and died five years ago. We didn't let you know. I couldn't help you. I'm sorry. That's all right. Make yourself at home. Shuji. You look like you've gone straight now. Let me see the Yasha tattoo on your back. It was terrible. They called it the Osaka War. They fought for the dope business, but... we lost and our men split up. You were right. You hated narcotics, and left us. We were fools. What brings you to Osaka? Shuji. Did you come to get the man named Yajima. Don't go quiet on me. I wanted to see you, that's all. All right. You're seeing me now. I succeeded my husband as boss. I must observe the rules of our world. Shuji, if you do something... If you do... I'll have to take care of you, because... you used to belong to our group. You don't have to tell me. I can guess. Listen. Tour Osaka... and... say goodbye to it. Return to the sea. You're following me? You're a fisherman now. Don't forget it. "Yaska" Shuji? Been a long time. Do you remember me, Boss? Of course. Shuji was a big name. What do you want? I have a favour to ask. Let me kave Yajima. Yajima? What're you on about? He hasn't changed. Stupid as ever. He's still a gangster. You can't have him. It's against the rules. Is that final? Wkat's come over you? I thought you went straight. I'm all alone. I'm going to need assistance. You mean cops? It's for you to decide to bring them in. Come to my office then. Hello. It's cold. Use this. Thank you. In Osaka, is it... snowing, too? I'm "Yasha" Shuji who phoned. Can I see the boss? The boss is playing golf. He won't be back today. Is that what he said? Let me have Yajima. The Firefly? I see. The Firefly? Yajima... Try to understand her. Is that all? You can't have him. The boss said so. You must leave. Take it. It won't harm you. It'll help keep you warm. Is that so? Thanks. I'll be going. Buy drinks with this. Not many, though. Let's go. Get him! Stop! You wanna die? We're leaving. We'll be waiting at the old theatre. Kill me. Brother. I double-crossed you. Forgive me. I couldn't have lived here if I'd done anything else. Forgive me, brother! Forgive me, brother! Brother! Brother! It doesn't matter. I'm happy. You went there for me. Yasha went to Osaka for me. I'm glad. That's enough for me. You know what? Osaka suits Yasha. The city lights suit Yasha. This town doesn't. Me, neither. What a nice face... A nice face. A man's face. It's Yasha's face. I'll go back to Osaka tonight. No reason to stay here. It's agony staying here. "The better the business... the more the happiness." "Thanks for everything, dear customers. Goodbye." Morning. Keita. Hello. Hideo's letter. Really? Thanks. Is he doing all right? I hope so. "Dear Mom and Dad." How are you? How's Mika?" "I'm fine." "Don't worry about me." Shuji! A letter from Hideo! His regards to you. "I'm working at a record shop in Tokyo." "I have a lot to learn." "I already know a lot about jazz." He's still a kid. He's got a lot to learn. "Everyday brings something new." "I'm enjoying the springtime of my life." Hideo.
