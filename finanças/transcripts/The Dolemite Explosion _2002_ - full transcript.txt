>> Welcome back, motherfuckers. I am the supreme originator. The number-one innovator. And I am sick and tired of you motherfucking player haters. It's been a long God damn time, but I am back. Yes, I am back on the scene. Now sit down and relax and screw your wig on tight. Now get ready to take a trip with me. Yes, me, the bad ass Dolemite. [ Explosion ] [ Shouting ] Keep it real.

I get give points for this motherfucker. >> He's thinking he's sweet, look at him. >> We work for Mr. Green and you know God damn well you never put the money in. Turn the money in and in return you'll get our shit. This is only a lesson. Hey, look, I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Peace. >> What you doin', man? >> I'm having a good time. >> You goin' to be dancing with my girl now? >> It's a free country.

You remember me, don't you? >> I remember everybody, Money. What did you come in here for? >> For my money, man. You owe us a little fatty. What's happening? >> There you go, pal. >> What the fuck is this? Where's the rest of my money, man? You owe me a lot more than this, homie, what's up? >> That's it, pal. Take it and get the fuck out. Oh, and by the way, leave your strap at the desk. You're fired. >> Fired? What you mean, nigga? >> You talkin' about Tritty? It ain't, Blue, man. Where the fuck is the money, man? People like me gotta pay bills and shit, dawg. >> When I ask you to take somebody out, I don't mean you showcasing a driveby. It makes me look bad. >> The motherfucker is dead, ain't he? The job is done. >> But now you've got 5-O breathing down my neck, fool. Now take your shit and get the fuck out. I got things to do. >> Oh, no, no. This conversation ain't over, Blue. Me and you, we have things to talk about. Oh, yeah, a lot more to talk about. I'll be seeing you, Blue. All of y'all. I'm keeping my strap, nigga. I don't ever leave without my strap. See you later, Blue. >> Think quick, Blue. We'll pop your ass over there. >> Bye. Dennis, Jackson follow them. I think they just had a bad accident. >> [ Laughing ] Got you, boss. >> And they didn't survive. >> We gotta find more work, baby. >> Chump change. Come on, man.

You better break up outta here before I smack you, fool. >> Come here. >> Can't you see I'm busy? >> I've got a message from Blue. >> Who? [ Automatic gunfire ] >> It's me, your sister Janice. Well, I had to call. We need you here. Things are bad. >> How bad are they, honey? >> Baggy pants wearing stupid fools, they bringing the neighborhood down. Settin' a terrible example for the young people. >> Well, what do you want me to do, honey, about it? What about the police? >> Oh, no, the police have their hands full. >> My boys have been wanting to come to the States for a good while. I'm going to give them a vacation. >> Oh, you will? >> Yes. >> Ah. >> We'll be on the next flight. >> Okay, I'll see you when you get here. >> It's now time to give, praise the Lord. The more you give, the more you shall receive. Praise the Lord. >> I have what I'll give! >> George, sit your ass down. One hundred dollars? I'll bless you when we get home. Praise the Lord. >> Amen. >> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain speaking. Welcome to the United States. On the behalf of African Airlines and the entire crew, we'd like to thank you for flying with us. Have a pleasant stay here in Los Angeles, California. >> What up, Reverend? Holy shit, you really scared the hell out of me. Oh, forgive me, Lord. Uh, how can I help you gentlemen today? >> We didn't mean to scare you, but what you can do for us is relieve yourself of that case. >> That's the church offerings. The Lord wouldn't want you to do this, my sons. >> Give up the case, you phony ass nigga. Besides, I ain't gonna tell the Lord if you ain't. Let's roll, homes. >> Oh, Lord. >> Hey, sucka. Move this bitch out of my way! >> Give the case back! >> Back my ass. Now you move this fucker or I'll blow it up. >> Give the case back! [ Electric shocks ] >> Oh, shit! Oh, shit! >> God damn. >> What's going on? What's going on, man? >> Ask Marvin Gaye, motherfucker. >> Oh, shit. >> Forget about the case, man. Let's go! >> My case! Thank you, Lord! >> You're welcome, Reverend. [ Laughing ] [ Doorbell ] >> Cal, would you get that, please? Thank you, baby. >> Miss Janice, there's someone here to see you. >> Ah! Hey, baby! Thanks for coming to my place! This is what I was talking about, look. We do after school sessions here. We do all kinds of classes. >> This is just what I need. [ Shouting ] >> Oh, how do you like your chauffeur? >> I got what I like and I like what I see and I want to thank you for bringing her because you know what I like, baby. >> All right, let me show you around. Everybody, remember me speaking of my brother? Well, here he is, Dolemite! >> Thank you. Sisters and brothers, my sister called me all the way from Africa to come here to help you all take the community back from the thugs, cutthroats, and gangbangers. I brought my two sons with me and they are specialists in martial arts training. They will teach you how to defend yourself, but I don't want you to use the art in the wrong way. When we teach you this art, it is not for you to go out here and pick fights. So I got something to show you. So brothers and sisters, I want you all to watch this. So if I can do all of that at my age, I know you all can do it better. So keep it real. >> Girls, your Uncle Dolemite is here. I asked him to come here. Something has happened and... I'll just let him tell you. >> Girls, your mother asked me to come here. She asked me to come here for a reason. Because when the streets were bad twenty-five years ago, before you all were born, I always straightened it out. She said, "Brother, come." So I am back to see that young ladies like you all will be able to walk the streets in peace. >> Why do you have to go? How come you can't just leave it to the police? >> The police is the last ones to take care of situations like this. >> Please Uncle Dolemite, please promise us you'll come back safe. >> Dolemite knows not everything. >> Promise me! >> I promise with every breath in my body, I promise. I promise. I promise. I'm looking for Officer Blakely. By the way, is he still working in your department? Downtown? Undercover? Captain, did I understand you to say he was working undercover? Well, thank you. Thank you very much. [ Punches landing ] >> Yo, where you going with my radio, you piece of shit? I'm talking to you. I said where you going with my radio? I said stop! [ Gunshot ] >> Sounds like you guys havin' a bad day. >> Bad day? Give me the fucking radio, you old piece of shit. >> You want this radio? >> Yeah, I want your fucking radio. >> Shoot him! Shoot him, shoot him! >> What the hell is goin' on? And what is your name anyway, man? >> Who wants to know? >> I want to know who you are and what is going on down here. Any man that can shoot like you... You remind me of that Chicago detective named Two-Gun Pete. >> Well, for your information they call me Blakely. >> Blakely! God damn! Blakely, Blakely, Blakely! I've been looking for your ass all over town. >> Who are you? >> I am Dolemite, the bad Dolemite. >> I should've known, all that African shit on. >> Let me take you home with me so you can chat with us and get out of them funky ass clothes. >> Those are some of the pictures I want you to look at. >> Now, if you gentlemen would like anything else, I'll be right inside. >> Thank you, sister. >> And I want to thank you for letting me squat here last night, Dolemite. I feel much better. >> You look better, brother. You even smell better. But I can't understand you being down here in this funky ass skid row alley. >> Well, you know the old saying, if you want something done, you've got to do it yourself. >> I'm sure you can find somebody that can do this instead of you, brother. >> Nobody gonna do that shit, Dolemite, nobody but me. I know how to do it and you know I know how to do it. That's why I do it. >> It's a dirty job, but if anybody can do it, I believe you can. >> You know it, too. I better get out of here. I've got things to take care of. >> One minute. Take them funky ass clothes with you. >> Same old Dolemite. >> Oh, my Lord. How can a man be so lucky? Look at you! Take a little bit off the top, baby. Come here. Oh. Damn, White, did you call before you come over? >> Yeah, Blue. I was just driving past. Thought I'd drop by. Hey, where's your daddy? >> He's in the back. Why? >> I thought I'd just run something by him. >> Well, run it by me first and I'll tell him. >> Hold it. I thought I saw Mr. White come through. Now, give me a break. >> Later, White. >> Mr. White, would you like to have a drink? >> Nah, I'm still on duty, but I'll have some of that candy over there. >> Mr. White, you don't want none of that candy. There's no telling what Blue and those girls got mixed with that candy. An apple a day keep the doctor away. Have an apple, Mr. White. >> I like apples. Hey, what I wanted to tell you was you've got big trouble coming your way. >> What kind of trouble? >> Yeah, there's this dude in town that calls himself Dolemite. >> Dolemite? >> Yeah. >> Mr. White, that's old news. I know Dolemite. Didn't you bring more news than that? >> Mr. J.L. Al Green. >> That's me. >> Yeah. I'm a cop, and I'm a nosey cop, secondly. You know he's aiming to shut you down? >> Where'd you get that news from? >> You remember that by-the-book cop, Blakely? He's got a big mouth, if you get my drift. >> I get your drift, Mr. White. Take this money and drift your cop ass on out of here. >> I'll see you later, alligator. [ Chuckles ] >> See you later, Mr. White. Blue! Get in here! >> What's up, Pop? >> Dolemite! Dolemite! Get Dolemite! >> Consider it done. >> Hold it! Don't kill him. Don't even harm him. Dolemite is mine. Bring him to me. Now get Dolemite. Get out of here! >> All right, come on. You heard him. Let's move. Move! >> Dolemite. Dolemite. Dolemite. Dolemite. >> Hello, darling. >> That's Dolemite! >> The Dolemite? >> Every day and every week. I noticed you running past my car and you look simply marvelous. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Did you know I was a doctor? >> A doctor? >> A doctor? >> Sex philosophy. [ Girls gasp ] >> I do have a PhD. >> A PhD? >> A PhD? >> A pretty hard dick, baby. >> Step around to the back, girls. Yes, that's it. You don't have to pull 'em all the way off, just pull 'em down. Ladies, this is your first class and you're getting a stand up in it class. Stand up in it, baby. That's what I'm doing. Stand up in this motherfucker. Oh, this class is right. When I'm finished with the black, I'm going to jump on the white. [ Moaning ] [ R&B music plays ] [ Moaning ] >> * So I can stand up in it * Stand up in it >> Stand up in it. Stand up in it. >> You know he can't do it. >> I bet you he has a small peepee. >> What's taking him so long, anyway? I have to go. >> Girls? I'm going to make love not too slow and not too fast. I'm going to make love like I did in the past. You're some beautiful ladies and stolen out of sight. I want you to get ready to go on this trip with bad, bad Dolemite. >> Oh, I can't wait. >> Oh, Dolemite! Dolemite! >> Oh, Dolemite, what did you do to us? I've never been made love to like that before. >> Yeah, how can a man your age make love like that? >> I may be too damn old to cut the mustard. Oh, baby, but I can god damn sure lick out the jar. Oh, my. >> [ Giggles ] >> Oh, shoot. Dolemite, you dropped... What's this? Hey, girl? >> Hmm? >> This guy was using Viagra. >> Now you know he was sure using something. >> But I thought he was real. >> Mm-hmm. >> Harder. Come on, kick harder. >> It's Blakely. You didn't call him back. He says it's important. >> Oh, I forgot all about that Blakely. My bag, man. Blakely, where you at? Daphne's on Manchester? I'll be over there in about a half hour. Janice? >> Hmm? >> I'll be home after a while. >> Okay. >> Well, Dolemite, it's just about time I want you to meet my friend Marsha here. >> Nice to meet you, Marsha. >> You know those guys that are looking for you that I was telling you about, the Mega Pointers? >> The Mega Point guys, those cats that was in the alley talking that Mega Point shit? >> That's right. Well, you know who's behind this is Elmo Green. Willy Green's brother. >> Willy Green. >> That Willy Green. >> So they're our problem. Blakely, you know we're going to have to stop them. >> You know it's not going to be that easy. >> I will rain on their parade so hard, they will think it's judgment day. Now watch this. [ Electricity zapping ] [ Shouting ] >> What the hell did you do to me? [ Chortles ] Damn. >> Get out the car, get out! >> Who are you guys and who do you want? >> Oh, I like the bread you got. I know you got some cheddar. Look at how this cat's dressed. >> Dolemite, what do we do now? >> Dole-who? What did you call him? Dole-who? >> Dolemite, motherfucker. >> Dolemite, we got every boy in the hood looking for you. We'd get big Mega Points for you man. >> I oughta take this gun and make you eat it, motherfucker. >> Fifty-five on this one, right here. >> [ Laughs ] >> Good job, Jackson. So I finally get to see the so-called badass Dolemite. >> In living color. Dolemite is my name and fucking up motherfuckers is still my game. >> Watch your mouth, tough guy. Sit down. I'll be outside. >> You've got the nerve to show your face in my town after what you've done to my brother? >> You know Willy Green was a martial arts fighter and good? When I got hold of him I made damn sure it was a fair fight. >> Fair fight my ass. Yes, you were the executor. This time, I guarantee you you are going to be executed. Executed! [ Laughs slowly ] It's a pleasure having you here, Mr. Dolemite. A little celebration, I would say. That's what my brother would say. >> Why you no business, barn, junk-yard son of a bitch! You better celebrate now because when I get loose you'll be celebrating with him. >> Now that wasn't very nice, Mr. Dolemite. You show some respect to my father. >> Back up motherfucker! >> That's okay, son. Those words you'll live to eat, my friend. You and your entire family are going to pay for it all. Blue! >> Yeah? >> Go down to the club, there's a dancer and a rapper down. I want you to check them out. Dennis, get this motherfucker out of here! He makes me sick! Put him in the basement! >> I want you to try some of that wicked shit now so I can put a bullet up your so-called witchcraft ass. >> Up your mammy's crap, motherfucker! >> [ Laughs ] Come on. >> Captain? >> Did I tell you the joke last week about the fly man and the... >> Yeah, you told me. >> I'll tell you another one. >> Officer Blakely? >> Yes, can I help you? >> Dolemite's been kidnapped. >> Who are you? >> I'm Dolemite's chauffeur, Angela. >> You mean, as pretty as you are, they kidnapped him and left you? Right. >> Motherfucker, listen to me. Dolemite's been kidnapped. >> Look girl, you better not be kidding with me. Anybody call me a motherfucker has got to be serious. So where did they take him? >> I don't know. >> Put the gun away, Johnson. Okay, Angela, get in the car and we'll talk about it. Okay? Come on. So, you don't know where they took him? >> No. >> Well, you know we've got to run this by Janice first. All right? OK, let's go, Johnson. >> I knew something like this was going to happen. What are we going to do? >> You're not going to do anything. You're going to stay put. I'm going to pickup a few of my boys and we'll be back at your house in about twenty minutes, okay? All right, stay cool. Let's go. >> They've got my brother. They've got my brother, oh, God. [ Chatter ] >> That's what I'm talking about. All right everybody, let me have your attention. Nuthead, Spencer, Martin, and Brick, step to the front. My daddy told me to reward you all. These four men are to be congratulated for the capture of Dolemite! Let's hear it for them! That's right! Let's hear it for them! Yes. Y'all give it up! That's what I'm talking about! You know that. >> I would like to say to each and every one of you, give these four men on the East Side a thunderous round of applause again. [ Applause ] And while you're at it, give yourself a round of applause. >> All right! >> I have one more small job. I am so happy I have captured Mr. Dolemite, but I want you to give me your three best men. I want his entire family. I want to have fun with the entire Dolemite family. Can you handle that? >> Mm, mm, mm. All right, everybody else out, enjoy yourself. >> While you funky motherfuckers sitting up there playing cards and I'm hungry as hell. Get me some food! >> Ah, you're so bad, Dolemite. I didn't know you ate food. >> Ain't that a bitch. If I wasn't tied up, I'd hang these hush puppies up your motherfucking ass. >> Jackson, go get him a hamburger. >> Son of a bitch, don't you go out and get me no God damn hamburger. Bring me a steak sandwich! >> Okay, is that it? >> No, no, bring him a soda. And bring me a steak sandwich and a milkshake. >> You got it. >> Oh, well, thank God. >> Sorry I'm late. >> Well, what took you so long? >> I had to pick up the A-Team. This is Mitch, that's Crazy Johnson there. >> Yeah, hello. >> Geez, Johnson. >> Well, what's up with the A-Team? >> Well, they were here. They went on over to Charlie Blue's without you. >> Ah, well I'm sorry about that, but in the meantime we're going to get your brother. You might get a call from a guy. We don't want you to go. You stay here, and you give me a call. >> Okay. >> Okay, let's go. >> Come on, Johnson. >> Let's go, Johnson. >> You're paranoid. >> Be careful. >> Here's your food, man. Oh, by the way, those girls are here. >> Oh, they fine, huh? >> Oh, yeah. Tell the emcee to put them up right away. >> Okay, I'll be upstairs. >> All right, if you're so damn hungry, well, here's your last supper. Anything for the executor before he is executed. >> Motherfucker, wash your nasty ass funky hands. Your hands smell like womp pussy. >> So you don't want this, huh? >> Get that shit away from me. >> I'll tell you what, it's this or nothing. [ Coughing ] >> Get me a drink of water, motherfucker. Get me some water! >> Now you want some water, huh? >> Get some water, man! >> I'll get you some damn water. [ Coughing continues ] >> Yo, yo, yo, pull over. That's it right there. >> How the hell you know where she live at? >> What's up with that, homes? How the fuck you know where she at? >> Man, what does it matter? We're here, ain't we? >> Yeah, we're here. Nolan, you come with me. >> Wait, wait, wait. What if she don't open the door, then what, homes? >> We'll break it the fuck down. >> Nah, y'all both chill. I got a better idea. >> What? You got some trick shit? You know something I don't know? >> Yeah, something like that. >> Something like that? You better not fuck this up. He fucking better hurry up, I know that. I don't know about this boy. >> What the fuck is up with that, homes? >> I don't know. We'll see, though. We will see. >> My brother! Who done it? >> Well, I'll be damned. Ain't that a bitch? She let him in. >> The fuck? >> Man, come on, man. What the fuck is he doing in there? Fucking her? >> I don't know. What the fuck is taking him so long, homes? >> If this shit ain't right, we kill his ass. [ Janice Sobbing ] >> He's fucking got her. He got her, homes. We're gonna get paid. Well, I'll be damned. >> Oh, my God. Oh, God. >> All right, homes, take her through the back, all right? >> Nah, take her through the side so nobody sees her. >> Where are we going to go? >> Why is he in her ear? >> You know why? Because he wants her pussy, homes! >> Play along with me. >> He's a fucking horny bastard, homes. >> Yeah. >> Everything is going to be all right. >> Oh, God. [ Snoring ] >> God damn, son. What is this? Hey! Wake your ass up! Is this what I'm paying you for? >> I'm awake. I'm awake. >> Mr. Dolemite, we have your sister and my people are looking for your boys. As soon as I find them, I got a little show for you to see. After that, it's going to be you and me. Tighten that shit up, please! >> [ Shouts ] [ Electricity zapping] >> Now, that's witchcraft for you, motherfucker! >> Please welcome to the stage the very lovely, the very sassy Bitter Honey. [ Applause ] >> Right now, you know what I'm saying. >> Nolan! What's up, man? Where the stuff at? We need this. >> She's back there somewhere. >> Yo, come on. Come on, man. >> She ain't in here. Nolan! Come on man, what is -- >> All right, fellas, I'm a cop. Put your guns down, turn around, and put your hands on that wall. >> I knew your bitch ass was a cop. >> It don't have to be like this, fellas, just turn around, put your guns down, put your hands on the wall. >> Didn't think this shit was going to happen, did you? >> You put it down, homes. There's two of us, only one of you. We'll blast your ass, motherfucker. [ Empty gun clicks ] [ Gunshots ] >> Bitter Honey. [ Cheering ] >> Jaz? Jaz, come on out, it's okay. >> Oh, my God. What happened here? What's all that shooting? >> I'll tell you later. >> Are they dead? >> All right, it's time, now it's time to introduce the winner of the third annual Elmo Green Talent Show and Fish Fry.

Look at that. >> That's harsh. >> Look at that, Nolan. God damn, look at that. Same old thing. Do you know whose work that is? >> Yeah, that's Blue. >> That's right. >> Gotta be Blue's boys. >> Speaking of work, I wonder what's working with Jaz nowadays, you know, Dolemite's sister. >> Yeah, how is Dolemite's sister, Nolan? >> Watch it. Speaking of her, man, I will never forget the look on her face when I told her I was an undercover cop. >> Come on, Nolan, tell the truth. You have a thing for her, don't you? >> Man, you mean to tell me you trying to make it with Dolemite's sister? >> No, man, come on. I mean, she's nice. >> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah, that's all. >> But, I...I... >> Got one for her, right? >> Right, a little. >> A little or a lot? >> Hey, what about these bad dudes Dolemite wants you to get for him? >> Oh, that's all set. They'll be in tomorrow. >> Oh, can we do us a little bettin'? >> I don't mind. >> Sure, I bet on Dolemite. >> And you, Reggie? >> Who else? Dolemite. You betting on one of Blue's boys? >> Betting? Who said anything about betting? >> [ Chuckles] Get out of here, Nolan. Go to work. >> Lover boy. >> I still think he's stuck on Jaz. >> It's true. >> Okay, let's get out of here and go to work y'all. >> Hello? Oh... It's Elmo Green. >> Elmo Green? >> He wants to speak to you. >> I want to talk to him, too. Elmo Green, are you still running, motherfucker? What's up now? >> Mr. Dolemite, you're a very smart man. I have a deal that might interest the both of us. Would you like to hear it? >> I want to hear it if it's getting rid of your funky ass. >> That works both ways pal. >> I'm waiting. Let's both you and I stage a fight. Your people against my people. >> Yes, motherfucker, it is time for a showdown. When I see you, all hell is going to break lose because we are going to whoop your ass to Sunday and be waiting for you on Monday motherfucker. Now, where is the place? >> Ballser Park tomorrow at high noon. >> We'll be there and I want to let you know one thing, if you want to get some ass you got to bring some ass and that's what we're ready and waiting for, is to kick your motherfucking ass Elmo Green. >> I want your ass deader than a doorknob, Mr. Dolemite. >> Brothers and sisters, I just got off the phone with Elmo Green and he claims when he claims when he meets me again, it will be the fight of the century. I say to you all, we got to look over our shoulders because I am here to tell you that he will never beat me with the mystical powers that I have learned in Africa. Peanut? >> Yeah, boss, right here. >> The remedy that I got will energize your body and make you powerful and strong. [ Barnyard sounds ] [ Mechanical whirring ] I'm over here. I'm over here, motherfucker. I'm over here. [ Dog barking ] Here. Here. Right here. Here. [ Echoing ] Here! Did you all see just what happened? This stuff stimulates you and gives you the strength and power that you need to beat Elmo Green. I call it Voodoo Juice. >> I'm not going to drink that. That looks like blood. >> We got to take it because we need everything to make it work. So let's get ready and go. We're wasting time. Is this Ballser Park? It is? Well, I hope Elmo Green don't flake out and don't show up. Son... [ Mumbles ] You know I've fought all over the world. I've kicked asses until my feet were raw in Panama, cut up in Connecticut, had to fight a war in Warsaw. I can take care of myself. Look at all of these people who showed up. I'm going to give them a battle that they'll always remember. A battle of the centuries, the bad Dolemite and Elmo Green. >> Well, son, this is it. After twenty-five years, this old bitch is back. I see you got things half way together. It's going to be a nice afternoon. Dolemite, I'm just sick of the name, Dolemite. >> Oh, I think he's here. Yes. [ National anthem plays ] >> Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the fight of the century. We've got Elmo Green's crew over here, we've got Dolemite's crew over here. We do promise a spectacular fight, but first, would you believe -- wait a minute, man, I'm not fighting. It will all be over soon. >> Look at that bad, bad Mit Su! >> Mit Su! Kick ass, Mit Su! >> Nice one! Ass kick! >> Don't say ass kick, son. Kick ass! Kick ass! >> What is this? They're kicking their ass kicked out there. Where'd you get them? Without guns, they ain't shit. >> Don't worry about it, dad, we got more people coming. >> Well, you need to show me some, before I see it. Yeah, yeah, much, much better. That other one, man. >> From what I can see now, this could be very bad. >> That's my kind of girl, there. >> Yeah, another Dole-bitch down! >> Where'd you get that girl? I never saw her. Where'd you get her? >> Oh! >> Kick his ass, come on! >> Show me what you can do. >> Yeah! [ Cheering ] >> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's been a great fight so far, but I'm about to take on the second set of fighters. >> Okay, son, it's time to get this shit on the way, wipe this slate clean.
