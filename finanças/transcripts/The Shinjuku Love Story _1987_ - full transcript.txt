THE SHINJUKU LOVE STORY This is Shinjuku. Please be careful not to leave any belongings. Watch it, that hurts! Hey! TORU NAKAMURA TETSUYA MATSUI IZUMI IGARASHI MINA ICHIJOJI YASUO DAICHI KAI ATO KENGO KIMURA KENICHI OYA DIRECTED BY HIROYUKI NASU Thanks for waiting. -Here you go. -Thank you. Chako. Chako! Chako! What the hell!? Ugh. Chako! Chako! What happened here? No clue. Hello? You think he's dead? No way! A cat just killed a man. Crazy, right? Oh, no! That cat of your's quite… Yes? Heavy. He sure eats like a horse. He's just like a starving wolf, what a sight. He's very carefree. He's quite masculine. Thanks for the food. You're done eating? I am. Never figured I'd have a high schooler treating me. I'm in high school, but I'm already seventeen. How old are you? -I'm twenty. -College student? No. Then, what do you do? Just a drifter on the move. He's lovely… In what way? So what's your name? I'm Mari, Mari Obana. And I'm Yumi Harada. Not that it matters, I guess. And what's your name? Mine? You're asking my name, huh… What? Promise you won't laugh. No way, I wouldn't laugh. You really promise? I promise. Even if you were called 'Yosaku' I won't laugh. I would laugh at 'Yosaku.' My name's not as bad as that. It's Fumimaro Ichijoji. I can't even bring myself to laugh at that. I knew you'd laugh! You lying weasel! I couldn't help it! Still, it's quite a lovely name. Who're you kidding? Did you just bring a cat? You did, didn't you? You listening, mister!? It's a dog. What!? This is a restaurant, you know. Sign says you can't bring animals here! Sorry, I'm illiterate. Huh!? Sorry about this. The cat's actually mine. I see. We'll be on our way, I'm very sorry. Don't sweat it! You seem to attract confrontations. Good grief. How could you be so nice to that asshole!? Are you mad at me? Not really. All right, we should get going. The tab's 2,600 yen, Mari. What's wrong? My wallet's gone! I think I dropped it. What!? What's wrong with you!? I bought tons of Nintendo Famicom games, so I have just enough for a train ticket. What!? Try and look again, slowly. It's not there! How am I gonna pay the tab now? I only have 2,000 yen. Your parents are on a trip. If your father were to find out you skipped school, he'll kill you for sure. I'll figure something out, you two move along. What will you do? I'll talk to them and work something out. You can rest easy, I'm pretty good at these kinds of things. I'll leave it to you, then. Let's go, Mari. But-- It'll be fine! Would you quit standing there? Let's roll! So we're leaving without him? Are you nuts? He smells like trouble. If they find out we ditched school, we'll be expelled. Quickly, now! No way! This was my fault. You go on ahead. I'll just stay put. You idiot! What if the cops show up? I can't help it. I've fallen for him. You've really lost it. Maybe so. But what do we do!? We go home. You want a 600 yen discount!? You charge a ton for your spaghetti, and it wasn't even great. In addition, one of your employees has a rotten attitude. The hell did you just say, you dipshit!? I did nothing to foster any ill will. So I ask you to please shave 600 yen off my order. I'm willing to pay 2,000 yen. Listen here, bud. You reap what you sow. I'm not interested in hearing you out. Call the cops. -Yes, sir. -A 600 yen dispute is no reason to call the cops! If I must, I can compensate by doing the dishes. Like I'd let a hoodlum like you mess around in my kitchen! Call the cops. Move it. This is what happens when you show off in front of ladies. Dumbnuts! You piece of shit! What the hell do you want!? Cruisin' for a bruisin'!? Keep the fucking change. Of course they bailed on me. Damn it. Where's your friend? She ran away. Did you get a chance to talk to them? Yeah, they were actually very understanding. There he is, I found him! You liar. Let's go! Get back here, you shithead! Haruo Minami? -And you're Hideo Murata? -Yup. You already look like a clown, but your name's just the circus. Who cares about that? We didn't do shit. Mind telling us what we did, copper? Wipe that stiff expression off your face. I ought to arrest you for being so obese. Obese? You bastard! After him! Get off me! Inspector, those two dined and dashed our establishment, please go after them! I'll get back to you. That piece of shit, gonna kill him! Hey, Murata! Wait for me! We lost them. Oh, good. I took you to a sketchy place in town, my bad. I should be the one apologizing. This was because I lost my wallet. -Sorry for causing all this mess. -No worries. Is your cat all right? Choko! It's not there. Oh, no… I see it! Choko! Choko! Naughty! Hey! Where did that punk go, huh!? You hear me!? I'm asking you where he went! Covering for him won't do you any good! You bastard! Mari! Hey! We're the police, you piece of shit! Fuck you! You…! You're interfering with official business! Piece of shit… Amazing! I want him to be our sworn brother. You okay!? Chako!? Chako!? Hold up, you two! Can you two please take care of that cat? -All right. -Okay. We're counting on you! You're bleeding! Your lovely uniform's been torn to shreds. What!? Really!? Oh, dear! That's not fair, I'm taking one, too! -You shouldn't. -Gimme that! -I don't wanna photo! -Be a sport. What are you doing? You can't go back home that way. It's chilly outside. I could at least get you a skirt and a blouse. You can't! We're not thieves! What? Do you usually hit people, and act so brashly? No, I don't! That's a relief. But you can't walk the streets looking like that. You look like you've just been assaulted. Oh, no! I'll make sure the store owner gets it back. Okay? WILD LOAN Check this out! WILD LOAN WILD LOAN WILD LOAN SHIRAI CLAN HQ Sir. I know it's all a mess. But don't get too carried away in Kansai. No, don't do anything rash. I'll handle it once I get back. You got a call, sir. So, you iced him with something so flashy, huh? Amazing! Keep those rashly thoughts to yourself, you fool. Yes, sir! Sayama speaking. Welcome, sir. I'm here for a loan. Do you have your pay stub? I don't. Or an insurance card? Don't have that either. Then, your driver's license? I didn't bring it with me. I need some kind of ID! Well… I just never figured I'd need so much documentation. You think this could fetch me 10,000 yen? You fool! This ain't a pawnshop! Counting on you, then. May I have a minute of your time, sir? Bastard! You think you can mess with us, you punk!? I merely asked for a loan! Dumbass. You know this is Shirai Clan territory! Yet you still had the gall to come hassle us! Chop off his finger with this. You little punk! C'mere! Wait! T-Take the money! Just leave the gun! Stay back! The hell're ya doing? You asshole! You better pray that it doesn't get knocked over! Gramps! Hasta la vista. LOVE This is the first time I've had a girl cook for me. It's the first time for me, too. Having the pleasure of doing something for a man. So I'd like to continue doing all matter of things for you. Thanks. Excuse me. Yes? I've got some business to attend to, so please tell her to go straight home. Yes, sir. Fumimaro! Fumimaro! Fumimaro! Fumimaro! You think the boss' gonna be sick for a long time? Yes. I'm afraid he'll never quite recover. So, did you get the package? Straight to business, huh. If we screw this up, we'll all end up behind bars. We clear on that? Yes, sir. Well, I trust you. Once this mess is over, let's formally tie the knot and have a big second generation ceremony. Counting on you. I appreciate it, sir. What!? Tazaki, you won't be able to find him by yourself! What am I gonna tell the precinct, huh!? That we both got our asses kicked by some dine dashing punk, and he even handcuffed us to our own car!? Fine, just take it easy. You listen good, Morishita! If you see him, don't you lay a finger on him without me knowing! I reserve the right to beat him half to death! You got that!? Move it! Here you go. Don't make any noise. It's seem like you're starting to enjoy this, Inspector. How dare you make a fool of the police! I'll make sure to dump you in jail and throw away the key! The fuck're ya doing!? Seems like you're all talk after all. You shithead! Make all the noise you'd like, maybe the waitress'll be the first one strolling in. Hope you're ready. You better remember this, you punk! I'll fucking kill you! I tend to forget things, so if you need me to remember, you'll have to lose your pants again. Get back here, you piece of shit! Hey! Get back here! I'm gonna kill you! Out of the way, girls. Welcome to Shinjuku. Mitsui. That's him! You piece of shit! Get back here! Don't shoot, please! All right, cut! We're in the middle of shooting a scene! Anyone who's been shot will need to lie down for a while. We still need to get some shots. Please come with me so I can fix your makeup, Mr. Tanaka. Make way, please. We won't accept autographs during shooting. -Excuse me, may I get an autograph? -Please, sign here! -May I have an autograph? -Please, gimme your autograph. A shootout!? And the cops!? You idiot, now they'll be taken to the hospital! I can handle the pigs, and squash that fucking lowlife! We'll gather all our men and get them right on this! I'll drill a hole in his body, and he'll no longer be a problem! No need to get all excited. Calm down, sir. Sir!? He went to Suzumura's? Seems like he went there with a girl. There's no doubt he's a scumbag. Just our luck! Just perfect! I knew that punk got tangled up in Shiari Clan's affairs! C'mon, you gotta play this by the book and inform the precint. Forget that thing with the pants, Tazaki! -If you do something rash, they'll fire us! -Wait. Settle down! Now listen up. The whole gang's after him, so he has something they desperately want! And you know what happens if we beat them to the punch? We get promoted, which includes a 30,000 yen monthly bonus! Really? I'll handle that prick, you handle the clan, then we'll become the heroes of the precinct. Heroes, huh… Terribly sorry, we're about to renovate the place. Come back some other time. That gun. You shot one of those before? It was my first time. Could've fooled me, you looked experienced. Anyone could shoot that accurately at close range. Where do we go from here? We run. We gotta turn ourselves in. It sure beats the yakuza. You think? After that cop assaulted you like that? You idiot! You've done many bad things. Yeah. You're not a good person! You're a real jerk, you know. That's right. I'm a real jerk. So then, why'd you bother following my lead? Because… I thought you needed my help. I never asked for your help! So spare me that bullshit, missy. It's just-- I've… fallen for you! Back then, I thought you had left me behind, and I was devastated. But then, we met up again. It didn't matter to me who you were, I just felt overjoyed! Move it! Don't you move! Fucker! Stay still, you little shit! Listen, kid. Just gimme back my piece. Fine. Just don't kill me. You sure got some nerve. Don't you fuck with me! Take it easy, okay? Where's my gun!? You asshole! Stay back, or I'll kill him! You sonuva… Everyone throw your guns in the water tank and get behind the counter! I've got no qualms about killing this prick! Tell them to do it, gramps! Do as he says! Fucking move it! Hands in the air, and turn around! Look, kid. All we're after is that piece you got. I wanna give it back to you, but I can't afford to right now. I promise I won't hurt you if you give it back. The words of a yakuza aren't worth shit to me! Lose the merchandise. You bitch! Punk! You asshole! I'll kill you! Hold it! I'll make it up to you if you just gimme that gun. Think about it! Your fly's open, gramps. You okay? I'll manage. You bastard! Move it! Get the hell out of the way! Bro! Been looking for you! Here you go. Chako! Thanks, guys! There, there, kitty, kitty. Bro! I gotta borrow your ride. Meet me at the west exit parking lot! You little punk! Come back here! Are they gone? Yeah. I… I… I fired a gun. But… I didn't kill anyone! Don't worry. You only damaged some property. But… But still, I… My bad. For making you go through this. You're still a little girl. I hope you'll forgive me. Don't give me that look. I feel even worse when you look at me like that. It makes my heart pound like crazy. And makes my throat parched. I share your plight. Chako!? What's wrong? Chako. Oh, no… It's probably just hungry. All right. I'll get it some milk, so wait here. Fumimaro! It's nothing. Just felt like calling your name. Don't take too long. Sure. Bro. Mari! Drop by our HQ if you want your girl back! SHIRAI CLAN HQ There it is! Around 30 people, including members of the Shirai Clan, were forced to repay their debts. Shirai Junior and the Four Mad Dogs are well known for their success. You write that kind of shit in your notebook? Please refer to me as the Emperor of Shinjuku. If you need any intel about Shinjuku, I'm your guy. Nobody could hope to match the Shirai Clan when it comes brawls. Will you be okay? I'll be fine as long as I got this with me. I just gotta go for it. You've fixed up so many! -Perfect for three people. -We're here to help, bro. Stop acting like fools, you brats! The hell? We're not brats! You two are nothing but brats. I appreciate your consideration, but I'll only be needing your ride. SHIRAI CLAN HQ Don't move! You little punk! Don't do it, sir! Let go! I'll kill this prick with this! Back off! Stop! Nobody will touch him until the mess behind me is sorted! -Put out the fire! -Yes, sir. Not bad, for a lowlife such as yourself. You still got a chance to be spared if you apologize. The more shit you spew, the sooner the cops'll be here. I want the girl back. We assumed you had taken her back yourself. Tell him what happened, Matsumiya. Our partner who took your girl hasn't come back yet. We thought it was your doing… -Don't you bullshit me! -We're not! That's why the rest of the family is out on the lookout right now. That phone call might be news. Shall I get it? Go. Yeah? Who the hell are you? I'm acquainted with the man who got his pants pulled down by that young fella. Tell him we got his little girl. There's nothing to be afraid of. I saved you from the yakuza. I'll show you a good time while your boyfriend comes. You filthy pig! Who're you calling a pig? Huh!? You better come, or we'll do nasty things to her and arrest her for prostitution. Come to the autopsy room at the abandoned Yutoku Hospital. Don't forget to bring the piece with you. Fine! So what's the deal, pal? Sorry. It was a wrong number. Don't fuck with us! Fumimaro… Bro! Where's the girl? -The coppers took her. -Those damn pigs! Emperor. -Do you know where the Yutoku Hospital is? -I got a map. Don't hurt the kids! I'm who you want! Come! You punk… Son of a bitch! You're dead! So, did you kill him? He dead? I think I shook him off. Chief! I can't see shit. Ryu, light it up! Right on! Don't shoot, it's me! I need medical attention… You're pathetic! You dipshit! Eat shit! You're dead! We're holding her here, against her will. The Shirai Clan's after that guy. He might be dead already. Which means, no one'll know about this confinement. Outside from her and us. Right. So if she bites the dust, we'll be totally out from under this. You gonna kill her? Are you serious? Eat this! Die, you motherfucker! Kaneda! He's too strong, Chief… Ken! Shoot! Gimme that! Maybe we blew that bastard sky high. You fool! He wouldn't die that easily! You're really acting like a Chief now! You shithead! I'm gonna kill you, you bastard! Shit! Enough games, pal. Don't provoke me any further. And you get off my back! "Pal!" Shit… Wait up, Chief! Back off, you bastards! We're both gonna get iced at this rate, what'd we do? I don't much care to have a double suicide with a guy. We'll settle this with our fists. You seem so sure of yourself. Too late for apologies now. I wasn't planning to. What do we do about this? Screw it. Let's empty the chambers in our guns. Both our guns. How's that sound? Sounds good to me. You got a deal. Cheating bastard! Asshole! Sorry 'bout that. The smaller, the better for killing a girl. Unless we're talking… About this time! You gonna shoot her? No. I'm gonna rape and choke her. They'll think some sexual deviant did it. Hold it right there! Hey, little girl… Wait for me, wait for me! Little girl… Hey, where ya going? I ain't gonna hurt ya or nothing! Damn! Oh, it's just you, kitty. Don't startle me. Lead me to Mari, Chako! Where are you, little girl? Fumimaro… Where are you, sweetheart? Hey! Are ya here? Guess not. She's around there. Kill her, Tazaki. I wondered where you ran off to. I've been looking all over for you! All right now, c'mere. I'm gonna make you feel real good. I haven't fucked a teen in so long! That hurt, you know. Fumimaro! Get out of the way! You bastard! So you're alive. You bastard! Come and get me! You prick! Fuck! I'll kill you! Scumbag! You piece of shit! Asshole! Damn you! Stay the fuck outta my way! I want the stolen Walther! You're just in time. I'm outta rounds. Do as you wish with me. But keep the girl out of it. I couldn't care less about the girl. My business is with you. You're history, pal. No! You can't kill him! You fool, stay back! No! Mari! Don't do it! Time to go to hell! Chako! Lucky bastard. That was my last round. Bring it! Come on! Get up! Don't fret. The party's nearly over. Bring it, bitch. You've come far for a mere punk. But you're through! Piece of shit! You still had ammo left! That was my last one. You're the biggest scumbag I've ever laid eyes on! Mari! Fumimaro! Hey! Hey! Hand over Shirai's gun! If you hand it over, I'll convince the precinct that we were all just going after the Shirai Clan! That way they'll let us go! Maybe they'll even give us an award, what'd you say!? I'm tired of your bullshit! What an incredibly lame guy to wanna meet you in front of the Dai Building a year later. I think he's a very romantic man. He's so careless to send a cat by courier. But… He looked everywhere for a cat who looked just like Chako. He's such a sweetheart. You dummy. Don't be fooled by a cat. That man's no sweetheart. He is a sweetheart. He just gets a little carried away sometimes. He's more honest than most people. So he's just like Momotaro, huh. Hey, that's freezing! Say… What'd you think about an entertainment company? We don't need a big crew, and since I know how to handle things, we could make it big. Showbiz, huh… No thanks. Well then… Guess we'll just have to make cash from our scorching bond portfolio. That's far too gloomy for me. Then, what do you propose? You just sit there and think by yourself all day! Bingo. What? Did you just figure out something better? I did. What is it, then? Let's just go ride that thing for now. Sounds like a plan, then. Subtitles by GEO9875
