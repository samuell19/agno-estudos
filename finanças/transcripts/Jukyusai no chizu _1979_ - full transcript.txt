You're ten minutes late. You should kick your opponents in the face. It's violent. You've got no guts. Don't think of them as human beings. "Collect charges! More than 95%!" Thanks. 5000 yen in all. Pay it back with interest. I'll double it. Today, with this money... This makes your debt 1000 yen less. Boy, he's smart. I can only buy one ticket. Tails and I'll try my luck. Konno, eat quick. The other boys are waiting. Horse racing again? You said you quit. You said you quit drinking and smoking. You only talk. Konno, bathe sometimes. You stink. Yoshioka, comb your hair. Don't be like him. Even if you're his roommate. Kazuko, the toilet needs fixing again. Will somebody help me? Give me a towel. I'm not your housemaid. Thanks for the meal. I'll get a plumber. "Preliminary School" "3-80 Takinogawa, Kita-ku" "Shiro Sato" "2-17 Takinogawa, Kita-ku" "Susumu Kobayashi" You should give up on going to university. You'll feel better. I'll go. I'm not like you. The pachinko hall 'Rainbow' is no good. They fixed their machines so the customers would lose. When I worked in a pachinko hall in Shikoku, I let my customers win. They flattered me calling me Mister Konno. They gave me cigarettes. All the pachinko halls in Shikoku wanted to hire me. You'd better quit here and work in a pachinko hall. You won't be happy here. I can't go back to Shikoku. I lied to a lot of women. I doubt you ever had a woman. You don't believe me? I don't. You always tell nothing but lies and cheat. "I won't let you lick me!" "You don't work hard." "Your family's hungry, and you just screw." "You're great! Someday I'll see your statue in town!" Can't we do something? Should we stop them? Just listen. "Damn you! I won't let you have your way!" "Kill me! Kill my child! And get lost!" "Drop dead!" What should I do with my life? I don't know. Where're you going? Collecting. Don't look at me that way. Boy, what arrogant eyes! Don't touch my desk. Who are you? I'm collecting for the Maicho. What? The newspaper. For three months. 6000 yen. Oh, so you're the paperboy. I don't read your paper. Maybe next door. Aren't you Mr. Mori? That's my name. But I don't read your paper. I've delivered it here every day for the past three months. I haven't seen it. Must be some mistake. I'm sure. No kidding. I haven't seen it. Who's kidding here? Looking for trouble? Trouble? I delivered the paper here every day. You did not. I haven't seen it. I did! No! I did! I said no! Fucking brat! Go back to your hicktown! Mr. Mori! Takao Mori, three crosses. Four! Five! Piss woman! Paperboy! The ball! The ball! Paperboy! Throw it here! Hello, Suzuki speaking. Who's this? Hello, you have a noisy dog, don't you? Is he around now? No, I'm not from the Health Department. You're marked two crosses. Is the dog there? Go take a look at the dog now. I beat his head until he died and hung him at your entrance. Take a good look, you cunt! Mori speaking. Hello? Who's this? Bring three bowls of noodles. What? Three bowls of noodles? I'm not selling noodles. Who do you think you're calling? Think before you call somebody! I'm dying. Bring the noodles quickly. All right. I get it. I don't know who you are, but ask a butcher for a fish, a fishmonger for shoes, and a shoemaker for bread, and they'll beat you up! Okay, hit me. Hit me if you can. You know you're scum. Huh? What? I know what I'm saying. I'll hang you upside down on your door. I'll skin you alive. You can't cheat people, you fucker. You're scum! Idiot! Right wing. A right-winger. I'm a right-winger! A labor union doesn't mean a thing in a small shop. We're both poor. A strike can't change anything. Keep your eyes open. Yes, don't worry. I'll keep an eye on the boys. Hide it. You customers will be scared. You haven't collected 95%, but... Thanks. I'm hungry. I wanna eat some meat. Control your weight. You beat your meat too often. I do not. As much as Yoshioka. Four times a day. Stop joking. You'll become impotent like the master here. You wife will run away. That's too bad. Is that why his ex-wife left home? Who knows? Shut up and work! He does it six times a day. Did you know? He's still a virgin. V-I-R-G-I-N The boss wants you. She's angry. You owe me 19,000 yen. This is for the liquor shop. Not for you. You're not going to pay me back? Your collection rate is 87%. 8% less than the norm. Won't I get paid this month? It's a rule. No exception. We've got money problems. The number of subscriptions has decreased. The man in charge at the head office came yesterday. The newspaper picks at small shops like ours. "We Spread News With Our Hands!" I'll collect for you. He said he'd never seen my paper. For three months. I'll make him pay. Can you really? Let's share it. I'll buy a bookshelf. I'll buy you something to eat. Great! How did you make him pay? With this. Let's celebrate! Let's party! Girls! They look conceited. Slow down. Where are you going? Stop. High School? Yup. What grade? Senior. Let's have some tea. Masaru, come here. He's shy. Scared of women. He's my brother. He goes to Waseda University. Our father runs a bakery. One of the employees is using my car. So we're riding this crappy bike. It says "Maicho Newspaper". A news stand is next door. We borrowed it. So you're bakers, huh? You know Croissants? Petite pain, butter rolls, the long French bread. Cream buns, twisted rolls. We got 'em all! Bean-jam buns? Sure! It's cold, let's go. Let's go. No. My mother asked me to buy something. It can wait. I have to go home. Or she'll be worried. It won't take long. Let's go. A few minutes? Real quick. I'm going home. Stupid. Didn't you see his tattoo? I don't like the boy's eyes. They're no good. Nah! I tell ya put paper in back. "Nah!" ? What you looking? Herry up! "Herry up!" ? "Kaoru" Oh, you're paperboy? Wait a minute. You haven't got much. Lend me some, okay? Here you are. 2000 yen, right? Where are you from? Wakayama. Really, Wakayama? Good luck. "Satako" "Ouji Slum" I didn't steal it! I didn't, dad! I didn't! Let go of me! "When someone you love dies, there is no other way." "However, if you cannot die," "if you have to suffer more," "you must sacrifice yourself." "You must serve other people." "The person you love is dead." "Death is sure and definite." "You cannot do anything about it." "All you can do for the dead is to" "serve other people." What the fuck are you doing? Get in the ring! Turn off the radio! Come on! Steady! Once more! Come on! Lift those feet! Get your ass up! Keep steady, stupid! Once more! Your match is soon. Pick up your legs! You'll make your debut soon. How can you bathe in such hot water? It reduces my weight. I talked with the liquor shop owner. About a fan club for you. A fan club? I don't believe it. And I'll buy you a robe. With your name on it. Really? Really. Believe me once in a while. Lend me your soap. Why shave? You don't have a beard. Can't wait to be a man, huh? I understand. I shave for my woman. My sweet Maria. Not that again! My dearest Maria! She's fat as a hippo. She suffers, but she survives. Who's Maria? His woman. He's always praising her. She must be a Turkish-bath whore. How can you keep that lousy thirty-year old company? Look at his small tattoo. It hurt so much he quit. Do you think he'll win? Well... Betting? I'll bet against him. I hope he'll win, but he's got no guts. Put him down. Onuma! Pull yourself together! See. I was right. I won the bet. What a miserable sight! That chicken! Shut up, punks! Don't blame him. These harsh words for a friend who tried hard. Go home and study. Do you know what losing a fight means? You don't. I keep losing all through my life. That's life. 5000 yen is enough. He's worked hard for us. Goodbye. Take this. You can come back any time. Thank you. Self-Defense Corpse? His base is in Aomori. Must be cold in winter. Thank you. Goodbye. Hang in there. The nail is still sticking out. Fix it already. Konno, thanks for the robe. I'll see him off. Your house is marked a cross. A teacher acting like a whore! You can't deny it, can you? Homely girls like you shouldn't live. I'll skin you alive and hang you on your school gate. Wait for me, slut! Hoshino's, 2 crosses. Tough work. I admire you. Tough today, isn't it? I'm done. I'm a taxi driver. Some people are real weirdos. A girl took a ride from Asakusa. She had no money, so she offered herself. I accepted. A good lay. You're too young for that. It was nice. It was heaven. Heaven! Time to sleep! I'll pay you back in a month. Bullshit. No, this time I won't mess up. I'll get a lot of money. Liar! You owe me 50.000 yen altogether. You bought Onuma's robe with my money. I'm sorry. I'll give the money back. Don't put on that act. Wait! Just pay it back. What the hell are you doing? Stop it! Why defend him? He's a thief. Hit him! You should hit him, too! That's enough. Why?! Yoshioka, are you two gay? You're always together. It's weird, you living with him. Faggots! What the fuck did you say? You haven't done it with a woman, haven't you? You don't know shit about women. You don't know how to screw a girl! Queer! Fuck you! You make me sick! Stop it! Lay off! You don't have to fight. Look, Konno. You'd be better off, if you killed yourself. This is my futon. You're a thirty-years old man. You shouldn't cheat people. You mean Saito? I lied to him, but I didn't cheat him. But you stole his money, didn't you. Listen. You can tell lies, but you shouldn't cheat people. "Let the world listen!" "Kill the baby an me!" "If we die, the trouble will be over!" "Go on hit me! Beat me to death!" "You can't do anything but screw." She's groaning. She's enjoying it. Can't we help her? Don't pitty her. They have rough house for fun. They have sex groaning. They have kids groaning. Poor rats! "I'm sick of living with you. I was young once." "You begged, saying you'd make me happy." "And now you hit me." "My father and brothers have never hit me." "They treated me like a princess." What am I going to do with my life? Konno. Konno. Does your Maria really exist? Let me meet her. I want to see what she's like. All right. See for yourself. Come in. Come in. This is Yoshioka, a student of Waseda University. Make yourself at home. Hello. Tea? I'll get it. Thanks. How's the weather? Fair. It'll be cloudy. Why the bruises? Nothing. Just bruises. Yoshioka is bright. Not like me. "Waseda! Waseda! The king of the athletes!" He works had. Girls love him. I'll get some nice tea for Yoshioka. My leg? I jumped from a window on the 8th floor. Somehow dying ain't easy. Look. I got hurt and that was all. Want a massage? I had a strange dream last night. Hundreds of people emerged from my body. They flew to heaven. Really fast. I think it was heaven. They were laughing happily. Only I was left on the ground. I was at the foot of a cliff. Some angels in white dresses were on the cliff. They reached for me to pull me up. I wanted to go up there, but I couldn't hold out my hands. I stood there immobile, looking up at them jealously. You're afraid of becoming happy. Get yourself together. Yoshioka, give me your hand. I going to take a leak. Get up, Konno. Get up already! Just a little longer. Get up! Hurry up! "I'm a student. It's been a month since I came to Tokyo." "I like to listen to the radio at night as I work." "I hear truck drivers are fond of this program." "My boyfriend is a trucker too." "I think he's listening like I am." "Whenever he is, I hope he's driving safely." "That's a message from Junko." "All drivers, please drive carefully." "Rain, rain is pouring." "Mother's coming soon to pick me up with an umbrella." "That makes me happy." "I give mother my heavy school bag to carry." "And far away a bell rings." "Oh no, oh no the other child is soaking wet" "and cries beneath big willow trees." Konno. Don't get the papers wet. You can get wet, but not the papers. I understand. Can't you move over? I can't work with a fatso around. I'm sorry. I've been admiring your work. I'll help you. Excuse me. I'll tell you one thing. You shouldn't steal milk. We'd get mad if somebody took our papers. It's the same story. How many bottles yesterday? Five. I only stole one. You still haven't fixed the floor? What will we do if somebody seriously hurts his foot? "It's four o'clock." Take this money. You're warm. You're wet. Hang on a second. What should I do with my life? I don't know. My husband has a girlfriend. This time I got proof. That's how men are... They won't change. This time it's some slut from the cabaret club. I'm done this time. I'll go back to Korea with the kids. Yeah, you should. Mom! There's someone here. Who is it? Oh, the paperboy. Sorry, I didn't hear you. Did you come before? No, I haven't. The rice dealer yelled at me. He came here twice in vain while I was praying. Your receipt. Your service is really bad. How about bringing some free soap or something? There are other newspapers, you know. Not again! How many fish do you have to kill? Never do that again! Each time he buys fish, he kills them. He's as violent as my late husband was. He has an older brother. That one even beats me. Uhm... You look pale. Is something bothering you? You can't solve it yourself. Come in and have some tea. Listen to me, and you'll feel better. You don't have to worry alone. I can help you. Why don't you come in? I have to go. Thank you. Poor creep! Two crosses! Thanks for waiting. Please, have some coffee. Masae, get a cup of coffee and some cake. Your receipt. University student? No, I'm not. Perliminary school? Yes, sometimes. I see, sometimes. Where are you from? Wakayama Prefecture. But no accent. Where in Wakayama? Shingu. Where is Shingu? Kishu. In the south. I see. Must be tough so far from home. How much sugar? One piece? Two? No, three. Is your mother back home? Yes. Your father? He's dead. That's too bad. Everybody has a misfortune or two. That's life. Don't let it beat you. Shoji Nishimura Another cross added. "Wife: Tomoko Daughters: Masae, Kyoko" "Wife: Ex-teacher" "Hypocrite" "Katsuya Kawashima" "Age: 45" "Works part-time at noodle shop." "Greedy for things free of charge." Where are your books? You sold them all? Yes, to a used book store. I don't need 'em. I think I'll go home to Shikoku. With Maria? Yeah, I'll start my life over again. I'll straighten out. You know there're other men beside you. May be... I don't mind. She treats me the nicest. She's just a urinal. She'll do it with any guy. Every woman is like that. She gets hurt by herself. And by others. She's covered with scars. My Maria is scarred all over. Only scarred? I don't get it. She's a real woman. Look! I bought a new one. You didn't pay for it, didn't you? Too pale. Never mind. Like a panda. Beautifuuuul. They're using my futon.

Is your father in? He's out. You want him? Your mother? She's out shopping. What grade are you in? The sixth. May I have your name, sir? When your old man comes home tell him this. I'll see to it that you can't live there anymore. Got it? Tell him that! I'll blast the four of you with a bomb. So don't stay there. Understand? Repeat it! Where are you from? Ibaragi Prefecture. I thought so. Me, too. Where in Ibaragi? Mito. Mito? Me too. I've joined the "Honor Japan Force". Are you right-wing? Yes, a right-winger. Of course! Well... What can I do for you? I just wanted to know we're from the same town. Thank you for taking the time. I'm going to burn your house. What did you say? Listen. You're marked three crosses. So I'll barbecue you and your family alive! You got that? Fire, smoke, blood! Everbody'll die, you son of a bitch! Hello? Hello? Scum! Ass! Bastard! Dirt! Thief! Somebody! "Gas Tank" "Takinogawa High School" "Yuai Hospital" Thief! "Thief injures Greengrocer" Konno was born a good-for-nothing. But I can't blame him. Since I got married, I've become a rotten woman. When I was young I was pretty and likeable. I always shampooed my hair. I liked cleanliness. What did you do before you married? I worked in a lot of spas. I was a chief maid. I loved clothes. I collected kimono. I bought a lot of them. Many men bougth kimono for me as gifts. When I first met my husband, he said he'd buy me an expensive kimono. And this is the result. In the end... I saved a man deserted by his wife. It's a woman's pleasure. You want some tea? Hello everybody. It's lunch break. Here's a letter from Mrs. Ishiguro in Yokohama. "Vegetables are growing in my garden - egg plants," "tomatoes, cucumbers. And there are also weeds." What should I do with my life? I don't know. "My daughter likes plants, so we let the weeds grow." "Scarred Maria" ? Who's she? I don't really know. He imagined her. He imagines various things. Besides, no one believes him. He's a dreamer. So that means... Konno committed a crime for a "Maria" that doesn't exist. An illusion... An illusion-driven crime, then. Can I see him? That's not possible right now. What about his relatives? His brother lives in Shikoku. He didn't want to come. He asked us to hang Konno. But don't worry. Konno is fine. He even looks happy. He even sings in his cell. "Your eyes are shining as bright as the stars." "My heart is aflame with love." "Even if the blazing sun pales in the evening." "Our love will never cease to glow." Konno... I'm very sorry for him. What do you mean? I mean Konno! Anything wrong with him? Don't just stand there. Come in. Coffee? How do you like the wardrobe? Konno bought it for me. He made money at the races. He's a nice guy. There's no one like him. Sugar? Two. It's okay. Let me. I'll help you. Konno's in jail because of you. He stole something and was arrested. He mugged some women, too. Aren't you surprised? You wanted him to run away with you. The child... Child? Konno's child? Liar! Bitch! Damn fool! You want to have it? Konno, too? With your face and your leg... Who's going to take care of you? Do you think you can make any man happy? What a joke! All you can do is screw. Fucking is the only way you can get men! You live like dirt! Nothing but screwing! You've got nerve! You're disgusting! You're not human! You should die rather than live this way. You're crazy! Dirt! Scum! Die! Stop it! If you want to die, do it alone. I said stop it! I can't die. I tried so many times but, God won't let me die! I wanted his forgiveness. Forgive me. I want you to forgive me. Tokyo Station The Mizuho Express to Nagasaki? Is it the Mizuho? Is there a seat available today? Today? Today... Wait a minute. Nevermind. I'll tell you something. My brother has a bomb. He's going to blast the train. I thought I should warn you. He's crazy. I couldn't stop him. He's a violent leftist. I'm a nationalist. You don't believe me? What? To tell the truth, I made the bomb myself. Everybody pisses me off! I'll blast the train sky high. It'll kill everybody, faces and bellies crushed! That's what'll happen. You can't stop it, asshole! I called you yesterday. You think I'm lying? Just getting my kicks? You're damn wrong! I'll do it! I'm serious! You mean sabotage? Not only that! I'll explode those gas tanks! Listen. Don't get excited. Do you want money? Money? I'm loaded! Then what will you do it for? Asshole! Please, calm down. If you do it, a lot of people will be killed. That's not my problem. Let them die. It's their own fault living here. Why should I be responsible for it? But why this town? Idiot! Scum! Don't ask me why! Even if you're angry at something, why should you explode the gas tanks? Because you're too easygoing. You live without a purpose. Anyway... I have no time to talk! I'll blow everybody up at noon. I won't fail. I mean it. I'll do it. For sure. Really. I'll do it. Really. Wait and see. "Don't give me that, Iouse!" "Damn you!" "You think only you're decent!" "I don't need you anymore." "I'm through with you!" "I'm fed up! I don't want to live anymore!" "I'll kill you!" "I'll kill you and myself!" "I'll kill you, Mariko and myself!"
