But everyone here knows that Halloween was invented by the candy companies. -(GASPS) -It's a conspiracy. It just so happens that Halloween is based on the ancient feast called All Hallows' Eve.

Well, why don't we go to this old Sanderson house? Well, come on. Make a believer out of me. Okay, let me get changed. They'll never miss me. Max, we're not going up there. My friends at school told me all about that place. It's weird. Dani, this is the girl of my dreams. So take her to the movies like a normal person. Dani! Look. Just do this one thing for me and I'll do anything you say. -Please? Please, please? -Okay. Next year we go trick-or-treating as Wendy and Peter Pan. With tights, or it's no deal. Okay, okay.

"The book is bound in human skin, "and contains the recipes for her most powerful and evil spells." -I get the picture. -(CHUCKLES) What's that? It's the Black Flame Candle. "Black Flame Candle. Made from the fat of a hanged man." "Legend says that, on a full moon, "it will raise the spirits of the dead when lit by a virgin "on Halloween night."

(SISTERS WHINING) -Winnie. -I'm dying. Shut up! -It is but water! -Most refreshing. -It is. -You idiot! The boy has tricked us, and he's stolen the book. After him! -'Tis a black river. -Perhaps it is not too deep. (SCREAMING) -'Tis firm! -Careful, Winnie. -'Tis firm as stone. -Why, why, it's a road! -Firm as stone, 'tis firm as stone. -Sisters, my book! (SIREN APPROACHING) (SIREN WAILING) (HORN BLARING) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, this is a graveyard. MAX: It's hallowed ground. Witches can't set foot here. He talks. Follow me! THACKERY: Over here. I want to show you something. Give you an idea of exactly what we're dealing with. "William Butcherson"? "Lost soul"? Billy Butcherson was Winifred's lover. But she found him sporting with her sister, Sarah. So she poisoned him and sewed his mouth shut with a dull needle, so he couldn't tell her secrets even in death. Winifred always was the jealous type. -You're Thackery Binx. -Yes. -So the legends are true. -Well, come along. I want to show you something else. -Teenagers again. -I hate Halloween. Man, this is the worst night of the year. Can you give me a hand? -Who are they? -Boys! Witch hunters. Observe, they wear black robes, and carry axes to chop the wood to burn us. -Hold me. -What a pretty spider. (WHINING) Sisters! Let me make one thing perfectly clear. The magic that brought us back only works tonight, on All Hallows' Eve. When the sun comes up, we're dust. -Dust? Toast? -Toast. -Pudding! -(SCREAMING) Fortunately, the potion I brewed the night we were hanged would keep us alive and young forever. Unfortunately, the recipe for that potion is in my spell book, and the little wretches have stolen it. Therefore, it stands to reason, does it not, sisters dear, that we must find the book, brew the potion, and suck the lives out of the children of Salem before sunrise? Otherwise, it's curtains! We evaporate! We cease to exist! Dost thou comprehend? Well, you explained it beautifully, Winnie. The way you sorta started out with the adventure part and then you sorta -slowly went into the... -Explained what? Come! We fly! Because of me, my little sister's life was stolen. For years I waited for my life to end, so I could be reunited with my family. But Winifred's curse of immortality kept me alive. Then one day I figured out what to do with my eternal life. Now, I'd failed Emily, but I wouldn't fail again. When Winifred and her sisters returned, I'd be there to stop them. So for three centuries, I've guarded their house on All Hallows' night, when I knew some airhead virgin might light that candle. -Nice going, airhead. -Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay? We're talkin' about three ancient hags versus the 20th century. -How bad can it be? -Bad. -Stay out of there! -Why? It holds Winifred's most dangerous spells. She must not get it. Well, let's torch the sucker. It's protected by magic. -(WITCHES CACKLING) -(ALL GASPING) It's just a bunch of hocus-pocus! Sarah. -Mary. -(DANI GASPS) Max! Brave little virgin who lit the candle. I'll be thy friend. -Hey, take a hike. -Ouch! Book. -Come to Mummy. -'Fraid not! Thackery Binx, thou mangy feline. -Still alive? -And waiting for you. Thou hast waited in vain, and thou will fail to save thy friends, just as thou failed to save thy sister! (YOWLING) Grab the book! (SCREAMING) -They can't touch us here, right? -Well, they can't. I don't like the way you said that. Unfaithful lover long since dead. Deep asleep in thy wormy bed. Wiggle thy toes, open thine eyes, twist thy fingers toward the sky. Life is sweet, be not shy. On thy feet, so sayeth I! Max! Max! (ALL SCREAMING) Hi. Hello, Billy. Catch those children! Get up! Get up! Get out of that ditch! Faster! In here! -(GASPS) -(GRUNTING) Mmm-mmm! Yes! (GROANING) -Are you okay? -Mmm-hmm. -What is this place, Binx? -It's the old Salem crypt. Here, take the book. It connects to the sewer and up to the street. Charming. -Don't look up, Dani. -Don't worry, I won't. Relax. I've hunted mice down here for years. Mice? Oh, God. WINNIE: Oh, cheese and crust. He's lost his head! Damn that Thackery Binx. Billy, which way did they go? Billy, listen to me. Follow those children, you maggot museum. And get my book! Then come find us. We'll be ready for them. Quit staring at me! Get moving down that hole. -Damn, damn, double damn! -Broom, ho! THACKERY: This way. Broom, ho. They're here. I know they're here. I know they're here, but where are they? -Sniff them out, Mary. -They're, they're... Oh, I can't. They've gone too far. I've lost them. I'll have your guts for garters, girl! Confound you! Very well. We must outwit them. When Billy the Butcher gets here with my book, -we shall be ready for them! -Book? Ready! -Sarah! -Sarah! Let us start collecting children. Why? Because, you great buffoon, we want to live forever, not just until tomorrow. The more children's lives we snatch, the longer we shall live! -Right! Let us fly. -(BARKS) -Fly! -Wait! Sisters. I have an idea. Since this promises to be a most dire and stressful evening, I suggest we form a calming circle. -I am calm! -Oh, sister, thou art not being honest with thyself, are we, huh? Huh? Come on. Give... Gimme a smile. (ALL GRUNT) Come along. Not much further. See, which way, which way? I can't remember. Oh. Look, down here! Think soothing thoughts. Rabid bats, black death. Mummy's scorpion pie. ALL: Mother! (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (HORN BLOWING) Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble. Tell me, friend, what is this contraption? I call it a bus. -A bus. -A bus? -And its purpose? -To convey gorgeous creatures such as yourselves to your most forbidden desires. Well, fancy. We desire children. (CHUCKLES) Hey, that may take me a couple of tries, but I don't think there'll be a problem. -Hop on up. -Marvelous! Thank you. Thank you. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm! I need one of those instant ice packs. You girls are givin' me a fever! Yow! MAX: Go, Binx! ALLISON: Come here, you guys, this way! (GRUNTING) ALLISON: Come on! THACKERY: Up the ladder. -Come on. -DANI: Careful. Hey, buttercup, anybody ever tell you you're very easy on the eyes? Binx, look out! Whoa! Speed bump! Binx! Oh! Speed bump! (HONKING HORN) Oh, my God. It's all my fault. Max, it's not your fault. -Look. -Max. I hate it when that happens. What? I told you, I can't die. Dani, you all right? -Yeah. -Okay, then, let's go. Stop! -I smell children. -Marvelous. Hey, cupcake, don't I get your phone number, your area code? -You want my route schedule? -Thou wouldst hate me in the morning. -No, I wouldns't. -Oh, believe me, thou wouldst. Party pooper. -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -What is this, sisters? Odds bodkins. (SNIFFING) Farewell, mortal busboy. What are those? What's that? Who's that? Hobgoblins. Bless you.

We are evil. -Evil? -What would Mother say if she could see us like this? -Oh. Mother. -Mother. ALL: Master! What kind of costumes are these? -It's the Sanderson sisters, right? -At your service. Haven't seen you for centuries. But what the heck, why don't you come in? Come into the nonsmoking section. -Come on, come on, right this way. -I can't believe it's him! Don't step on my tail! -(GROWLS) -(CHILDREN SCREAM) -DANI: Officer, Officer! -Officer, we need your help. What's the problem? -Tell him. -Go ahead. Well... Well, you see... I just moved here. Well, you see, it's like this, I... I broke into the old Sanderson house and I brought the witches back from the dead. See, I even have the book. -You lit the Black Flame Candle? -Yeah. Come on. Okay, let's get on the sidewalk. And he's a virgin. Come here. -Are you a virgin? -Yeah. Really? Look, I'll get it tattooed on my forehead, okay? -Officer, this is not a prank. -Really. Hey!

You cook it sometimes with lovely bread crumbs, a little bit of margarine or olive oil is good. (STAMMERING) Sarah. Sarah! (GASPS) I have an idea. What is this place? SARAH: It reeks of children. WINNIE: It is a prison for children. (MAX HOWLING) Welcome to High School Hell. I'm your host, Boris Karloff, Junior. (LAUGHING) It's time to meet our three contestants, Sarah, Mary and Winifred Sanderson. Read any good spell books lately? (BARKS) Hag tracks! Get him. (PANTING RHYTHMICALLY) FEMALE VOICE: Hello. Welcome to the library. (WOMAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON SPEAKER) I would like a book. (WOMAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON SPEAKER) What kind of book are you looking for? -(YELLING) -(SINISTER CHUCKLING) We've got them! We've got them! I am looking for a children's book. Hello? (SCREAMING) Wretches! -Fire. -Fire. It's hot. It's hot. (WITCHES SCREAMING) (MAX SCREAMING) Farewell, Winifred Sanderson! -Burn! Burn! -(ALL CHEERING) All right! Yeah! Yeah! All right! (SHOUTING JUBILANTLY) (SIGHS) We did it, Binx. -We stopped them. -I've wanted to do that for 300 years, since they took Emily. You really miss her, don't you? Man, you can't keep blaming yourself for that. That happened so long ago. Take good care of Dani, Max. You'll never know how precious she is until you lose her. Hey, Binx! Where do you think you're going? You're a Dennison now, buddy. One of us. Come on, Binx. Let's go home. Home. Home. Mom? Dad? We got a new cat. Mom? Well, I guess they're still partying. Come on in. You're my kitty now. You'll have milk and tuna fish every day. And you'll only hunt mice for fun. You're going to turn me into one of those fat, useless, contented house cats. (GIGGLES) You betcha. (CHUCKLES) You know, Binx, I'll always take care of you. My children will take care of you, too. And their children after that. And theirs after that. Forever and ever and ever. (PURRING) (WITCHES SCREAMING) (WITCHES COUGHING) Hello. I want my book. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (COUGHING) JAY: You wanna smash some pumpkins? ICE: No. JAY: You wanna look in windows and watch babes undress? It's 3:00. They're undressed already. -Well, then you think of somethin'! -I don't feel so good. 'Cause you're eatin' too much candy, you oinker. (WITCHES MUMBLING) -Yes! -Yo, witch! Get your face off my shoe! Wrong boy. Sorry, Winnie. Why, why, why was I cursed with such idiot sisters? (SOBBING) Just lucky, I guess. Oh, man, how come it's always the ugly chicks that stay out late? Chicks? We haven't much time left. We shall have to make -the potion from memory. -Hey. -Let us out of here. -We're really sorry. -We think you're really cute. -Hush! I've got to think. Hey! Remember, remember. BOTH: Remember, Winnie, remember. Remember, Winnie... -Now, I remember! -(BOTH GASPING) I was here. The book was there. You, Mary, you were here. Sarah, you were in the back dancing, idiotically. -And the book said... -Yes? I remember it like it was yesterday. Oil of boil and a dead man's nose. -Dead man's toes! -She's trying to concentrate. -No, his thumb. -Thumbs? -Or was it his gums? -I don't know. A dead man's buns. -A dead man's buns. Sounds like... -Mums? -Mums. Funs. Funs. -Chungs. -Chungs? -Dead man's chungs. There's no such things as chungs. -You're right. -I am? I'm right. It's no use. I don't remember the ingredients. I've got to have my book! (JAY AND ICE MOANING) Leave him alone! I'm gonna puke. Book. Come home or make thyself known. (SOBBING) -Hi. -Hi. Oh, my God. It's 5:00. My parents are gonna kill me. I should go. I wish you could stay. Poor Binx. Yeah. Poor Binx. We owe him a lot. Yeah. Look, can we find some kind of way to help him? The book. The witches used it to put the spell on him. Maybe there's a way in here to take it off. I don't know. Binx told us not to open it. Well, the witches are dead. What harm could it do? Well, just be careful. I will. Hold my hand. All right. ALLISON: Nothing weird so far. Winnie, do you want to hit me? Would that cheer you up? -Okay. -(SOBBING) -There you go. No. -This is the end. I feel it. -Okay. -We are doomed. I feel the icy breath of death upon my neck. -Mary? Take me to the window. -What? -I wish to say goodbye. -Yes, Winnie. -Good-bye. Good-bye, cruel world. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye, cruel world. -Good-bye to life. -Bye-bye, life. -Good-bye. Good-bye. -Good-bye-bye. -Good-bye to all that. To all that. Sister! Observe! They opened it! (LAUGHS) Just when our time was running out. -Come! We fly! -We fly! On what do we fly? Into the night! Winnie? -Broom, ho! -(VACUUM STARTS) Oh, listen to this. "Only a circle of salt can protect thy victims from thy power." (SCREECHING) -We were just trying to help you. -Well, don't! Nothing good can come from this book. You got it? Maybe we should go now. Okay. Mom? Dad? They're still not home. That's weird. Must be havin' a great time. I don't know. Something's not right. I'd feel a lot safer walking home if we had some salt. Salt. What's it say? It says, "Form a circle of salt to protect from zombies, "witches and old boyfriends." And what about new boyfriends? (GLASS BREAKING) Dani. Dani! Max, the book is gone! I'm tellin' you, something's weird. -Dani, wake up. -Trick or treat? (SCREAMS) -Looking for this? -Or this? (SCREAMS) Boy down. Salt! What a clever little white witch. But it will not save thy friends. No. Come, sisters. The candle's magic is almost spent. Dawn approaches. -Bye-bye. -DANI: Max! DANI: Let me go! Put me down! (COUGHING) Dani. Dani. (WITCHES CACKLING) Dani! Are you okay? -Come on, get up. -Where's Dani? WINNIE: Use thy voice, Sarah! Fill the sky. Bring the little brats to die. (LAUGHING) ♪(SINGING) Come, little children ♪I'll take thee away ♪Into a land ♪Of enchantment ♪Come, little children ♪The time's come to play ♪Here in my garden ♪Of magic -Dani! -Dani! Hey! Hey, you guys! Don't listen to her! Hey, up here! -Don't listen to her! -Max, Max, I figured it out! -What? -Winifred said, "The candle's magic will soon be spent. "And dawn approaches." The Black Flame Candle only brought them back for this one Halloween night. And unless they can steal the lives of children, when the sun comes up, they're dust. Yeah, but how can we make the sun come up? They've got Dani. We need a miracle. The children are coming! Well done, sister Sarah. (STRAINING) THACKERY: Let me out of here! ALLISON: Hurry, okay? But watch out. Come on. -MAX: Get out of the way! Move it! -(HONKING) I'm gonna ralph. -Open up. -No more candy, please. Soon the lives of all thy little friends will be mine. And I shall be young and beautiful again forever. It doesn't matter how young or old you are! You sold your soul! You're the ugliest thing that's ever lived and you know it! You die first. Hmph! (BOYS SCREAMING) -'Tis ready. Pry open her mouth. -Gladly. -Dani, don't drink it! -Shut up, you! Open your mouth. Open it. She bit me. (GROANING) Prepare to die! Again. You! You have no powers here, you fool! -Hollywood! -Maybe not, but there's a power greater than your magic. -And that's knowledge! -JAY: Come on, man. And there's one thing that I know that you don't. And what is that, dude? Daylight savings time. "Daylight savings time." (ALL SCREAMING) Max, -get me out of here! -WINNIE: The sun! It hurts. -It's okay, Binx! I got you. -Hot cat. Hot cat. Hey, let me outta here. Help, help. Hey! Hollywood, help us out here? Tubular. (GROANING) -Yes! -Let me outta here, man. -Come on, Dani, let's go! -Let me outta here! Max, I wanna see her turn to dust. Pump it! Allison. (CAR DOORS CLOSING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECHING) -I am alive! -Damn that boy! He's tricked us again. -Oh, you're right. You're always right. -It's my curse. That, and you two. Get off me, you thundering oafs! Sorry. Look! The candle's almost out! And my potion. My beautiful potion. Look! There's just enough left for one child. Get the vial! Come on! Move it! Oh, joy. What luck. This is perfect for that little towheaded brat. We have a child. -Him! -And look, Winnie. More children are arriving. Come on in. Winnie, Winnie, we'll make more potion, because we have the book! We haven't the time! Besides, I want to get that little rat-faced kid that called me... -Don't even say it. -Ugly? (BOTH SQUEALING) Oh, honey. I know. -She really hurt my feelings. -She's jealous. -She don't even know me. -I know. You know, I always wanted a child and now I think I'll have one on toast! Step on it, Max! Are they following us? No. Good. Pull over! Let me see your driver's permit. Resisting arrest? Yee-haw! Way to go! -THACKERY: Hurry! Hurry! -Max! Go, go, go, go, go. THACKERY: Come on! Let's get a move on! -Max! -No, wait, Dani! Run, Dani, run! Billy! Billy, listen to me! Kill him if you must. Just bring me that child, that Dani. And put some wiggle in it, you putrid, festering sore! Don't dawdle. Come along now! Come along now. Kill him! Do it now! Wench! Trollop! You buck-toothed, mop-riding, firefly from hell! (EXCLAIMING) I've waited centuries to say that. Oh, say what you want. Just don't breathe on me. Billy! I killed you once. I shall kill you again, you maggoty malfeasance. Hang on to your heads! -Max, run! -Move out of the way! Wait, wait, no! No! No. He's a good zombie. Come on. THACKERY: Come on. We'll have to hold them out until dawn. -It's our only hope. -Hi, Billy. -You'll be safe in here. -Thank you. -You okay, Dani? -Yeah, fine. All right, then. In we go. There. Here they come! Billy, guard Dani. Max, Allison, spread out! For the last time, prepare to meet thy doom! (LAUGHING) You little pest. I've had enough of you. (LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) -DANI: Billy! -Go to hell! Oh, I've been there, thank you. I found it quite lovely. (CHUCKLING) Billy, I think you dropped this. Oh, God! Max! (SCREAMING) Dani! Bye-bye, big brother! (WINNIE CACKLING) All right, you little trollimog. Hold on, Dani! This'll teach you to call people ugly. Open your mouth. Open your mouth, I say! WINNIE: Confound you! -Give me that vial! -Put her down or I'll smash it! Smash it and she dies! -Max! -No! Max, no! Now you have no choice! You have to take me. What a fool to give up thy life for thy sister's. (DANI SCREAMS) DANI: Max! -Dani! -Allison, Billy. Put him down! -Boy! -Max! (BOTH GROANING) DANI: Max! Hallowed ground!

You freed me, Dani. Thank you. Hey, Max. Thanks for lighting the candle. EMILY: Thackery. Thackery Binx. It's Emily. I shall always be with you. Thackery Binx, what took thee so long?
