Oh, how I want to go back I want to go back someday To have Bahia in my heart again Oh, clear water that has no end There's no other song in me I miss it so much... Oh, how I want To feel that joy again The joy of going back to Bahia To find the love I left behind I've just arrived from Bahia and I'm already talking about how I miss my homeland, and how I want to go back. And I know that I'll keep on talking about it. At least until I go back, around December 8th. to attend the Concei??o party. And until that day comes. I keep on singing. And I have a lot of sambas to play, and if they are about Bahia, I sing even better. So long My love And I won't come back God Willing I'll ask someone to bring you to me At the full moon When the sand is even whiter I'll ask someone to bring you to me Have I told you that there was no rehearsal? I'll talk to him. Good idea. I'd talk to him. but I'm a little scared. He's always complaining about everything. I'm afraid of talking to him. He got really upset. Edson is a polite guy. He's very polite, but he lost his temper yesterday. Really? With you? Not with me, with Macal?, but I was offended too. - I didn't see that. - You were not there anymore. I don't know why, but the flutist left the studio and said that he was going to see you play. - He's crazy. Edson. - Completely nuts. "I won't rehearse because I'm going to see Edson's concert." Isn't it insane? I thought he was kidding! Suddenly he left the studio and never came back! - Great! - Great? What about the rehearsal? I'm sorry... - I'd like to do that, you know? - Do what? Hold the camera? This camera is awesome, a very silent one. The one they used at "Opini?o" was too noisy. - Hi, Pedro, how are you doing? - I'm fine, thank God. - Is it for me? Thanks. How are you? - I'm fine. See you. Right. No blue roses today? I'm out of blue roses. He brings me flowers everyday. - Who's this guy? - He's Pedro das Flores. Or Pedro da Noite, I'm not quite sure. 'Das flores', right? He picks flowers in the woods everyday. I think I will sing with a red rose tonight. Did you find one? Thanks. - Look. - What? Give this one to the other girl. Right. This is for you, "the other girl" Blue roses are weird... But It won't last long. It will die right after the beginning of the concert. Thank you very much. A red rose for a joyous pretty girl. Leave The delusion for those Who don't know how to love And who don't know how to love Will suffer Because they can't Understand That the love that dies Is an illusion And an illusion must die That the love that dies Is an illusion And an illusion... The talking movies Are responsible for the transformation Of the people who think That a shed is worse than a jail At the slum If I do something wrong Risoleta will give up Learning French and English The slang that our slum has created Were soon accepted and used by the city And now the scoundrel No longer dances the samba He's at the ballroom Dancing the foxtrot Nowadays there are people Who like to show off But they seem to forget That there's no translation for samba In French Everything that the scoundrel says At a low voice Is in Brazilian And not in Portuguese At the slum Love is for real And the rhymes of samba. Can you help me with the guitar? I'm about to record a beautiful song. My mum used to sing it at S?o Jo?o parties... - Look up at the sky, my love - I know it. Isn't it beautiful? See how it is lovely Look at the multi-colored balloon How it disappears in the sky It happened one night... It happened one night like this one That you gave me your heart The sky was in festivities Because it was Saint John's night What about Roberto Carlos? - What? - What do you think about him? I don't know him I saw Roberto Carlos sing... I don't know him in person, never heard him singing, only on TV shows. I swear to you. I'm not being snobbish. How could I do it to Roberto Carlos? He's the most famous singer in Brazil... I heard him singing "Que V? Tudo Pro Inferno". But I think this song pretty awful.. Oh, my God. Someone told me that he's a nice guy. - Do you know him? - No. Thank God. A friend of mine knows him. I've killed all the artists that I don't like, right? I'd try to figure out how they would die... It would be great. And Roberto Carlos would die doing that silly pose that he usually does when he's on stage, introducing the guests of his TV show. He'd die doing that pose. "This is red hot, dude". You met them right after you arrived from Bahia, right? No, I only met them recently. I didn't know any of them, they were all traveling. You didn't know anybody when you moved to Rio? - Nobody. - And how did you begin singing? - I began at the "Opini?o" show. - But were you in Bahia back then? - Yes. - Who invited you? Vianinha. Nara met me in Bahia. She was in Bahia one month before the premiere of "Opini?o". After one year in S?o Paulo I only sang "Carcar?", you know? I didn't sing any other song. One day I tried to sing "Andaluzia", a very beautiful song, but the reaction of the audience wasn't very positive. It seemed that I wasn't there. I sang it before "Carcar?". But they didn't applaud the encore. It has been more than one year singing only "Carcar?", so I want to sing something else. My record has 12 songs. I couldn't any song from my record, except for "Carcar?". It was funny, because the show was already over when they began to yell: "Carcar?!, Carcar?!". And I think that "Viramundo" is... I think that "Viramundo" is very violent. They ask for "Carcar?" every night, isn't it? Every single night. The owner of the club asked me to sing it on the last night. - Will you sing it? - Yes. I'll sing it because he asked me. He asked me to sing "De Manh?" and "Carcar?". I will sing "De Manh?" tonight. Do you prefer singing romantic songs? But I also like to sing a more "violent" song. I love it. I really love it. I feel more comfortable, it is better for me, you know? But I also like to sing "Marina", "Est? Fazendo Um Ano"... I don't like singing "mid-range" songs, you know? - "O Barquinho" and things like that... - I hate "O Barquinho". I don't like it at all. I can't stand this kind of music. A "mid-range" song is neither a romantic song nor a hardcore thing like "Viramundo", you know? It is neither "Marina" nor "Viramundo", it is something that gets stuck in the middle. I've recorded a song by Jocardes, a song that I love, it is really beautiful, but it's a "mid-range" song. I don't feel comfortable, I don't know where to put my hands or how will I look like when I'm on stage. I can't control my body, my voice, nothing, when I sing this kind of song. So be it Let them say what they want, My darling So be it Let your heart talk too Because he is right When he complains So we let things be, So be it, so be it, so be it.. Nobody lives more than once Let it be Say yes and don't say maybe So let it be The passion also exists Let it be Don't let me be sad Let it be Don't let me be sad Let it be He asked Antonio to call me to say that he writes songs in Portuguese and a Portuguese agent invited me to sing in Portugal. My friends... No, he called me to say that... a friend of him was in Russia and saw my record there, that everybody loves it and that "Carcar?" is a major hit. Give me this newspaper, Robertinho, I will show Julio something really cool. My father talking about me: "I met the old Veloso on the street and he said: Beth?nia has a sixth sense. A woman of unswerving character." This is great. This is my father... "when me and her mother were worried about her career, she calmed us down, saying that she knew what she was doing. Now I'm no longer worried." After holding you in my arms - I'm sorry. - I'll miss you so much Remembering the 40's... - Allow me... - Where's my scotch? I don't want it. Come here, hold my hand For I want to show you That life's a song That we never get tired of singing Beautiful chord. - Beautiful. - You like it? There's more to come. It's beautiful. Caetano's song is also beautiful. - I can't remember the lyrics... - Caetano's song goes like this: "Throw your cloak on the sand and run naked to the sea..." It's beautiful. Benedicta tu In mulieribus, tu Benedictus frutus Ventris tuis Jesu Jesu Sancta Maria Sancta Maria Mater Dei Ora pro nobis Ora pro nobis Pecatoribus Beautiful! Let's play it on a different pace. Branch?, I'll be waiting for your sign. "Morre..." and so on. - How do you want to sing it? - Faster and I want Noel's song faster too. Both of them. - Only tonight? - No, always. - But you said that... - But I changed my mind, I want it different. - But can you explain me how... - What? Do you want it as fast as we play at the rehearsals? Faster, faster... I will sing it in a high tone, rather than in a low tone. The pace is very slow, I'm not comfortable with that. - We've got play it at a high tone... - Hold on. - I know. - The tone is very low, everything's low. A guy on the front row tried to talk to me. A lot of people tried to talk to me when I got on stage. - "Beth?nia, Beth?nia..." - And I said: "Good evening..." "Hi, Fernanda, how are you?" "I'm fine! Everything's great!" Can you believe it? The show is about to begin. There's a very strong light above my head... Let me see, Suzana. Oh, Suzana... What happened? I don't know, there's a little smudge here. There's a purple smudge right above my eye, you may have dropped something. Look. Here's the smudge. What happened to my eyebrow? Sometimes things go wrong, what can I do? I'm a frequent globetrotter Searching for wonders Cutting with a knife and a blade The insanities of life Scaring away with screams The braveness of my enemies Jumping to avoid being caught By a web of intrigues I'd rather have my life as an enemy For all my life Than having my fortune told By the death of life I'm a frequent globetrotter Through the ways of the backwoods But I will turn this world Into feast, labour and bread The world will turn upside down And the globetrotters will see The leaders of this world Who are clever, mean and deceitful Be unseated by the world That they once ruled But I will turn this world Into feast, labour and bread Into feast, labour and bread All this is included and incorporated in the tour. Because in some cities, like in Paris, we play only one concert possibly at Palais Des Champs Elys?es, which is the best philharmonic theater of Paris. Just one presentation in Paris? Maybe one or two concerts, but I think one concert. Now, to make publicity in a town like Paris for just one concert, it is not possible. So what you really do, what we do, is we give television free to broadcast concert - and then television makes publicity. - I got it. - So the idea is... - Jararaca & Ratinho. This is a very important part of the scheme... - Fernando Lobo, Alo?sio de Oliveira and... - This is great! - Fernando Lobo... - Fernando playing violin! - He used to play violin. - And this, by the way... Djalma! - This is Macal?... - This is Djalma, look... - Ben?? - What? But we've talked about it previously, but I think it is better to discuss the proposition now, you know? Now, here's the deal: From my point of view, their proposition is very good. And Rosinha and Edu agree with me. - It is wonderful. - Wonderful. Luizinho is scared because he won't go. They can send a telegram to London saying that you agree, but you won't be able to go to London until the end of this 15-day season, and that the British leg of the tour may be postponed. I don't understand anything, you know? And because of that, they will offer... This idea which Luizinho proposed, - that we send a cable to London. - Yes. Exactly. Caetano, if Rosinha and Edu go, I will go too. She said that if Rosinha and Edu, if they go, she will go. Then ask her if we can discuss the contract. He's asking if we can discuss the contract. He will leave a copy of the contract with you. Can you leave the contract with her? Leave the contract to sign now? No, she first wants to know everything. - We can read now. - Let me read the contract for you. It's in Portuguese. - It's in English and Portuguese. - No problem. He's asking if you want to sign it now. She first wants to talk with Rosinha and Edu. ...two weeks, 500 dollars, one week. 250 dollars. It will be 250 dollars per week. That's it. It will be 500 dollars for two weeks, guaranteed. - Guaranteed minimum two weeks. - Two weeks. Maybe three weeks, maybe four weeks. Four weeks maximum. And we know, by early contracts. that we do three weeks or four weeks. He thinks that you will play for three weeks. I cannot give you a complete list yet, but... - What do you want? A list of hotels? - Yes. Not of the hotels, but of the places, the countries. The places, the countries. I cannot give you the exact list now, but I can give you an idea... Okay. That's what she wants to know, an idea. I start in the East. It will be Vienna, Austria. Austria. Vienna. Switzerland. Zurich, Basel, Geneva. Geneva, Lausanne or Montreux. Copenhagen, in Denmark. Stockholm, Sweden. Rosinha will play on top of the Berlin wall. Possibly Lund, which is a Swedish University. - In a University. - Lund is a University in Sweden. Sweden. Sweden. There's a University called Lund. I hope London, because it depends on the working plan. but I think it will be okay. I hope Amsterdam... I pointed my gun at the world But aiming at your heart The bullet weighs six pounds And has the power of hurricane I pointed my gun at the world But aiming at your heart The bullet weighs six pounds And has the power of hurricane The bullet hit it silently And fell on the ground The enamored pierrot That used to sing day and night Because of a Colombina Ended up crying Ended up crying I won't let another night Another peaceful night Come and take away from you This beautiful morning Made of dew That takes this joy away I'm the one who cries Watching your sleep Dreaming more dreams I won't stay in the middle of the road Because I have my love To make me company Goodbye I'm going and I won't come back And wherever I go I know that I'll be alone So lonely, my love I don't even want to think That I won't come back From my endless trip Oh, my love, don't go away See how life is crying See how sad this song is No, I beg you, don't leave me Because the pain that you feel now Can only be forgotten through forgiveness Oh, my beloved, forgive me Because even though the pain that I caused Still hurts you I beg you, don't destroy All the things that belong to you For something that I've already paid for I beg you, don't destroy All the things that belong to you For something that I've already paid for Subtitles ripped by gooz karagarga, 2020
