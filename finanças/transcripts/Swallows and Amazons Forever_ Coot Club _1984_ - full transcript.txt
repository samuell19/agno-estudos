(upbeat music) - Stop both engines. Pass up the telescope, Tom. She's there and she's resting. - [Bill] Write that down in the Coot Club book, Tom. - Number seven, nest doing well. - Half ahead, both engines. (peaceful music) - Why have we stopped for so long? - We'll be going soon. He'll miss it if he doesn't get in quick. (whistle shrieks) (steam hisses) - [Tom] Oh, crikey. - He's missed it now. Here, hurry! (upbeat music) - Thanks for opening the door. - My father makes us do it all the time. - What? - He's an archeologist. - Mine's a doctor. - We know two doctors, and both of them are very old. - My father's quite young. - Ours is extremely old. He must be 40. - I never want to be 40. (steam engine whistles) I don't suppose they're for your father's surgery. - They're for my boat. - You have a boat? - She's called Titmouse. She's not very big, but she sails like anything, and she's got an awning. I slept in her last night. - Alone? - Your father didn't mind? - He likes boats. So does everyone in this part of Norfolk. Do you like boats? - Rather. - We're going to stay in one. - Have you done much sailing? - Well, a bit. - None at all, not yet. - Well, I expect you'll learn quite fast. - That's what we want to do, isn't it, Dick? (engine whistle shrieks) - That a heron? - Are you interested in birds? - Yes, but we don't see as many as we'd like to, 'cause we live in London. - Do you collect eggs? - Certainly not. - Don't ever begin. - I won't. - We've got a bird protection society where I live. We don't collect eggs. We watch over the birds and make sure the nests are safe. This year, we're watching 37 nests. - 37! - And that's only in our reaches, Horning way. - That must be a record. - [Conductor] Wroxham, Wroxham station. Wroxham. - This way. - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Tom] Would you mind holding my bike while I load it up, please? Thanks. - Tom Dudgeon! I've now had several complaints about you, my man. Jumping on a train when you were fairly going? Might have broken every bone in your body. What would doctor have said then, huh? - I was on the platform in time, Mr. Frost. I was looking for Port and Starboard, then I tripped. I had to get on the train. - Port and Starboard? Well, I saw them go off with Mr. Farland more than an hour ago. They'll be on the river by now racing that boat of theirs. - Richard and Dorothea. Whoa, whoa. - Morning, ma'am. - Morning, Mr. Frost. Welcome to Norfolk, Richard. - Hello. - Dorothea. - Hello. - Well, we'd better get your cases on the back. - Well, I'd better be off now, bye, and thanks again! - [Dot] Bye. - [Tom] Bye. - Up you come. Who was your friend? - We met him on the train. He knows an awful lot about boats. - And birds. - What a mine of information he must be. - Oh, that's Tom Dudgeon, ma'am, doctor's son from Horning. Always on the water, he is, and those Farland girls, Port and Starboard. Thick as thieves they are, and all great sailors. Now ma'am, if you'll excuse me. - Yes, we'd better make a start. I promised Norman I'd get Rufus back as quickly as possible. Norman's the hostler, Rufus is the pony. Right, off we go, off we go. (peaceful music) - [Frost] Right, Jack, let 'em go. (moves into soaring music) - Well, now, I didn't see any direct resemblance with either of your parents. I think all in all, that's not entirely a bad thing. (upbeat music) So Dorothea, are you still writing your stories? Your mother tells me you're amassing quite a collection. - Actually, Mrs. Barrable, seeing as you're a friend of the family, we'd rather you called us Dot and Dick. - 'Cause usually, if we're called Richard and Dorothea, it means we're in for trouble. - Oh, I see. I must remember that. Dick and Dot is is, then. (upbeat music) - Hello, Mum, I'm back. - Hello, darling. Did you manage to find all you needed? - Yes, everything, I was jolly lucky. I just came in to tell you I'll be on Titmouse for the rest of the day. Must have her shipshape for the twins and the meeting. - Coot Club meeting? - Yes, it's to plan what we'll do for the last two weeks of the holiday. - Right, I'm just making tea. Would you like to take some down with you? - Lovely. (yapping) - There we go, you hold on to that, will you? There we are. (William barking) Hi, William. Ah, welcome to the Teasel, I hope you like her. - She's very nice. - Well, we have to get your things on board. Come on, pass 'em up. Hello, I spy pirates. I never expected see pirates in Norfolk, did you? - [Dick] They're rowing jolly well. - But look at that. (loud big band music) - Brace, now hold tight, hold tight. - [Dick] They're mad. - Inconsiderate and downright dangerous. Those boys could've been swamped. Did either of you get the name of that cruiser? - The Margoletta. - They had no business going as fast as that. It's quite illegal. (birds chirping) (lively dance music) (bird squawking softly) (lively dance music) - Ho, ho, stop both engines. Blast, would you believe where they're now moored? - Not across number seven nest. - Right across it. - Old mother coot won't go near the nest with that cruiser there. - We'll have to do something. - Right, row you over there and I'll hail 'em. Margoletta, Margoletta, ahoy! - Some old row they're making. - Margoletta, ahoy. - What do you kids want? - If you please, sir, it's where your mooring, sir. - Are you in a carnival or something? - Bird protection society, you're fair and square on the coot's nest with eggs nigh on hatching. - So what? - Old mother coot, she daren't come near while you're here. - Well then, the damn thing can nest somewhere else. We moor where we like, and we like it here. - Please, sir, them eggs will never hatch while you're here. - There's better mooring not 50 yards downriver. - Oh, buzz off. - But them eggs has to hatch. - Now go away, shove off, pronto. (lively dance music) - Hello, twins. - Hello, Mrs. Dudgeon. - How was the race, did you win? - Nearly. - But not nearly enough. - Oh, well, treat it as a practice race for the regatta. - I'd rather we practice winning. - You've come to see Tom, I suppose. Highly important Coot Club meeting? - Yes, is he about? - He's on board the Titmouse. - Okay, come on, Port. (upbeat music) (hammer thudding) Tom, are you there? Open it up. - So how did the race go? - We were second. We had to go about just as we were drawing level with the leader. - Did you get a chance to see number seven nest? Have the eggs hatched yet? - She's still sitting, at least I think so. - Oh, well, the Death and Glories have been making a proper patrol, so they'll know. - There they are now. - We've got bad news. - About number seven. - Why, what's happened? - The Margoletta's moored right alongside the coot's nest. - The Margoletta, that socking great cruiser? - We then asked them to move. - All nice and polite. - But one of them fellas, they told us to shove off. - And he just threw a bucket of water over us. That's real nice, that is. - What absolute rotters. - They're nothing but a pack of hullabaloos aboard that cruiser, tearing along the Broads too fast. - Upsetting everybody with their wash. - All that noise they're making. - What are we gonna do, Tom? - There's only one thing to do. If they won't move their mooring, they've got to be unmoored. - [Starboard] Set her adrift, you mean? - Yes. - But if you're caught, you'll be in bad trouble. - I know, but I don't want the rest of you getting it in the neck. So all Coots off the river. Find something to do and make sure you're seen doing it. - But setting a boat adrift, it's illegal. - [Starboard] And dangerous. There must be some other way. - [Tom] But there isn't. You've heard the Death and Glories. Those Hullabaloos can't be persuaded to move, and if they stay there overnight, the coots will desert the nest in panic. - [Starboard] But if the Margoletta goes drifting around, there could be a really bad accident. - [Tom] That's their worry, mine's the nest. (bird squawking softly) - [Dot] Trouble is, I never know what to say on postcards to people. - But I thought you were a writer, Dot. - Writing stories is different. - [Dick] The weather's fine and I wish you were here. - But I can't write that to Mommy and Daddy because it wouldn't be true. This is our adventure, not theirs. - Alright, then the weather's foul and I'm glad you're not here. - (laughs) Idiot. - I know they're beastly, Tom, but does that give you the right to put them in danger? - [Tom] They're threatening a nest and they don't care, so they can take their chances. - [Starboard] But if you're caught, you'll be reported to the police. You'll be fined and taken off the river. - [Tom] You don't beat bullies by giving in to them. - I know, shall I tell Mommy we'll be starting to sail tomorrow? - [Barrable] But my dears, we won't be doing any sailing. - What, not sailing? - But we've been looking forward to it for months. - We've talked about nothing else. - But surely... I thought I'd explained it all to your mother, but obviously I didn't. You see, now that my brother's not joining us, we won't be able to sail the Teasel. I can't manage her by myself, and you two don't know how to sail, so we could only use her as a houseboat. Oh, my dears, I am most dreadfully sorry. - [George] You're in a hurry, young Tom. - Not particularly. - What's the secret this time? - [Tom] It's none of your business, George Owdon. - Hold hard, look, you can see Tedder's bike. He must be having his tea. - So what? - It's the perfect alibi. - What are you on about? - Tom said to be seen off the river doing something. - I know what Tom said. - Well then, let's go ask PC Tedder if he wants his garden weeded. - Yeah, why not? - And we can dig up good worms for fishing. - Right then, let's go knock on his door. (suspenseful music) (Hullabaloos laughing) - [Announcer] Time for Mack to read us today's story. (suspenseful music) (loud dance music) - Livy, darling, thirsty? ♪ Another bride, another June ♪ ♪ Another sunny honeymoon ♪ ♪ Another season, another reason ♪ ♪ For makin' whoopee ♪ ♪ A lot of shoes, a lot of rice ♪ ♪ The groom is nervous, he answers twice ♪ ♪ It's really killin' that he's so willin' ♪ ♪ To make whoopee ♪ ♪ Picture a little love nest ♪ ♪ Down where the roses cling ♪ ♪ Picture the same sweet love nest ♪ ♪ Think what a year can bring ♪ ♪ He's washing dishes and baby clothes ♪ ♪ He's so ambitious, he even sews ♪ ♪ But don't forget, folks ♪ ♪ That's what you get, folks ♪ ♪ For makin' whoopee ♪ (upbeat dance music) (Hullabaloos chatting and laughing) - My God, we're adrift. Jerry, do something quickly! - What? Damn and blast! (Livy shrieks) - Oh, no! - Look, there's someone rowing away. He must have done it. - The little swine. - Well, don't stand there, let's get after him. (dramatic music) - Hurry up. (Dick groans) (dramatic music) (William yelping quietly) (dramatic music) (William barking) - That's interesting. - What's wrong with William? - I thought I heard someone on deck. - Something very odd, excuse me. It's those wretched people again. (dramatic music) - Where's that confounded boy? Hand him over before I summon the police. You, you set us loose! - I don't know what you're talking about, but this child and his sister have been with me all day. - And have you seen a boy go by on a sort of punt thing? - [Barrable] Most certainly not. - What? - What seems to be your problem? - Some little horror set us adrift. - Did heaven knows how much damage. - Sent half our records overboard. - Damn near broke my ankle. - And completely endangered our lives. - And we want him, the little beast. - Well, you won't find him here. - [James] Oh, well, he must be one of these three guttersnipes we saw this afternoon. - Took up our anchors and cast us loose. - [Ronald] We'll find him, and we'll wring the little brute's neck. - Oh, come on, we're wasting time with this old freak. Let's get on, he can't have gone far. (man laughs) - Young woman, I don't like your manners. - Oh, do pipe down, you old bore. You were never in danger. (Hullabaloos laugh) - Well said. (lively dance music) - What awful people. - They shouldn't be allowed on the river. - Selfish, unimaginative, and they think they own the earth. Excuse me. Hadn't you better come out and explain? - Thank you for sending them off like that. - Tom Dudgeon. - Well, they were five to one, weren't they? And very insolent. Well, what's it all about? (clock chiming) - You been doing a good job here this last hour. - Trying to, Mr. Tedder. We'll need some cash so's we can do up our little boat. - Well now, I reckon you done a pretty good job, here. - A tenner! - Thanks ever so much, Mr. Tedder! - Handsome be like handsome do. You saved me a peril of work in this old garden. - She'll be right soon. I can't tell you how grateful I am, Mrs. Barrable. I only wish there was something I could do in return. - There just might be, you know. Dick and Dorothea came here expecting a fortnight's sailing, and if you could spare the time to give them some instruction, I know they'd be delighted. - Oh, yes, do you think you could, Tom? - We'd really enjoy it. - Well, as long as I can keep out of the way of those dreadful Hullabaloos. My friends Port and Starboard might lend a hand, I think. They're twins, one's left-handed, so she's know as Port, and Nell's right-handed-- - So she's known as Starboard. - Well, you sound a versatile crew, Tom. So when can you start? - How about tomorrow morning? - Oh, gorgeous, and I shall write a book about it. - Thank you, Mrs. McGinty. Splendid. - What is? - Ginty's breakfast. - The regatta, you clown. They've accepted our late entry, so it's down to the water all next week. Three qualifying races and the finals on Saturday. - [Starboard] Smashing. - I suppose that means pack lunches for the rest of the week. - [Port] Don't forget the pop. - Pop, plenty of beef tea is what growing girls need. - [Girls] Ew. - And that's enough daftness from the pair of you. Bustle, bustle, time for the office. - Aged parent, how you slave for us. (Frank laughs quietly) Goodbye, Mrs. McGinty. - Bye, sir. - Come on, Port. (lively marching music) Farewell, aged P. - Goodbye, horrible. - Don't overdo things, A.P. - Oh, no danger of that, dreadful. (lively music) Goodbye, darlings. - [Both] Bye, Daddy. (upbeat music) - Take the roof down. - Yes, it's a lovely day. - There. (horn honks) - Right then, down to the river. There must be lots of Coot Club business to see to. - Yes, quick, before Ginty can send us shopping. - Girls? (lively dance music) - What do you think you're doing? - Hi! - Oi, Bessie. Morning, ma'am. - Morning. - Hello, hello, hello. Oh, not long ago now, Jane. Mr. Riley. - Hi, Bill. - Wotcha. (Hullabaloos talking quietly) - It's them, there are those wretched guttersnipes. - Get 'em, come on. (Hullabaloos shouting) - I got you, you little tyke. Where do you think you're going? (shouting) - Come here, hooligans. - And you, hooligan. - Give you the hiding of your life. - Let us be, will you. - What's all this, then? - [Livy] It's this boy, officer. - Oh, yes, what's he now done? - He came along yesterday afternoon when we were in our cabins and set us adrift. - Is that true, Joe? - I never set nobody adrift in my whole life. - Well, off course it was him. I saw him quite plainly rowing away. - So did I, damn it. - Very serious accusation, that. When would the offense have taken place? - I can tell you exactly. It was half past five, because they said so on the wireless. - Half past five, I see. Well, at half past five, them three boys was doing a bit of work in my garden. They didn't leave 'til after six. - Of course it was them. They'd been round earlier, asking us to move. - At half past five, them three boys was in my garden, ma'am. - Then it must have been some other young lout. - Well, I'll know him when I catch him. I had in my glasses and I saw him quite clearly. A real criminal if ever there was one. - Do you still wish to make an official complaint against these boys? - No, no, not these boys. But I'll find the young hooligan who did it. - Oh, come one, Jerry, let's go for a drink. - Off you go now, you boys. - Am I mistaken, Mr. Tedder, or is there a five mile an hour speed limit through Horning Village? - Perfectly right, ma'am, that is so. - In that case, those people have been disregarding that speed limit and the safety of other users of the river. They almost swamped me just now. Do I formally complain to you or the Bure commissioners? - I hear you, Mrs. Barrable. I reckon they'll be a bit more careful in future. I don't excuse the lad who set 'em adrift. Silly and dangerous thing to do, that, and I mean to have him for it, whoever he is. - You made a complete ass of yourself, Jerry, so just forget it. - Forget it? Do you realize that damn boy could have completely ruined our cruise? He is not gonna get away with it. - Don't be a fool, we'll never find him now. - Do you want to bet? - I'll lay you five pounds you don't catch him. - Alright, you're on. (dramatic music) (peaceful music) - They all row jolly well, don't they? I can't work out which twin is which, though, can you? - Port's the left-handed one and Starboard's the right-handed one. - I know that, but they don't speak left and right handed, do they? - Once we get into Ranworth Broad, we might be able to find some winds. - Splendid, don't tire yourselves out. - Don't worry about us, we're used to it. - [Port] Nearly there. - [Dot] And so, once they reached the tranquility of Ranworth Broad, the daring outlaw Tom began to teach our young adventurers the rudiments of sailing, aided by those reckless twins Port and Starboard. (upbeat music) As you must learn to walk before you can run, so you must, alas, learn to row before you can sail. But Dick and Dot persevered gamely and eventually were allowed to row down the Broad on their own. The first lesson in seamanship was taken closely to heart. - They ain't half bad, you know, for beginners. - Said the outlaw, apparently sincerely, but at all times concerned about his deadly foes aboard the giant cruiser and aware that his days of freedom were numbered. (upbeat music) But even in the midst of danger, there were compensations. (upbeat music) - Now pull it against your shoulder. Then push it, and when you get to the other end, twist it so you don't get so. - [Dit] Our young hero Dick had to learn the tricky ways of quanting, and quanting, as all sailors know, has its problems. (Dick shouts) (children shouting) - Quick. - What is it? - [Dot] Dick's fallen in. - Dick, where is he? Oh (laughs). - [Dick] Oh! - Get your feet down. However did that happen? (laughs) Come on, we'll have to get these wet things off. (peaceful music) - [Dot] The sailing itself took longer to master, and there were times when it seemed unlikely that Dick would ever learn to concentrate sufficiently. - Keep your eyes on the steering, not the birds, Dick. - Sorry. - [Dot] But within a very few days, our intrepid hero and heroine were beginning to feel at home on the water. - Oh, look. - [Tom] They're learning fast. - [Barrable] What a keep, jolly good! - Yay! (upbeat music) - Having completed their sailing apprenticeship, our young adventurers were now ready to begin their epic voyage to Yarmouth, Beccles, and beyond. But there was one disappointment. What a shame. - What's that? - Port and Starboard are going away soon with their father, and they won't be able to come with us on our voyage. - Yes, it is a shame. But look at it this way. Without them, you and Dick will have to really work, and that way you'll learn far more. Tom, here's a list of the things we need to take with us on the voyage, but are you sure you need to go shopping in Wroxham? Those awful Hullabaloos might spot you. - I think they're well out of the way by now. They might even have finished their hire of the cruiser. Anyway, I've got to to Wroxham to buy that oil lamp. - Yes, well, keep a weather eye open. - Aye aye, admiral. (all laughing) I'll be back by lunchtime. You two remember to practice your rowing. - [Dot] Don't take any risks, Tom. - [Tom] I'll keep my head down. - [Dot] Bye. - Bye. - Bye. (lively dance music) (birds chirping) - One, two, one. You must keep in time and stop watching the signets, Dick. And row, row scientifically. - Alright. - One, two, one, two. - Wait, listen. - It can't be. (lively dance music) (Dot shrieking) - Tom, they'll catch Tom, he doesn't know they're here. - But what should we do? - Tell the others, get help. Row, Dot, row. - [Dot] Joe. - What's that? - Come here, look! - The Margoletta, they've stopped. - But for how long? Look, that boy's telling them something. What do you think? - I think he's telling them where Tom is. (peaceful music) - [Dot] Port, Starboard, we need help. - [Joe] What's up? - [Dick] Tom's gone off shopping to Wroxham in the Titmouse. We saw this boy. - [Joe] What boy? - He was fat. - About 15. - Smoking a cigarette. - Sounds like George Owdon. - We saw him talking to the Hullabaloos and pointing upriver. - George Owdon's got a grudge against Tom. - We've got to warn Tom or the Margoletta will catch him. - If Tom's gone shopping in Wroxham, I'd better go on my bike and see if I can find him. - We'll just have to carry on rowing towards Wroxham then. - [Starboard] Wait, you're tired out, the pair of you. Port and I can take over from here. - Right, I'm off then. - [Starboard] You have to hurry. It's all getting worse and worse. - [Dot] How do you mean? - [Starboard] Just look at that notice over there. (dramatic music) - A reward will be paid to any person who can give information concerning the boy who on the evening of Saturday the 22nd cast off the mooring ropes of the motor cruiser Margoletta. - They really mean it, don't they? They're going to catch him and punish him. (dramatic music) - [Tom] Morning, Mr. Wooddall. - Now then, young Tom, making the best of the day, are you? - Don't I always? - That's the spirit. - [Tom] Hello, there! - Watch out, Tom, Hullabaloos! - Margoletta, she'll be here in a jiffy. - There's nowhere to hide. Quick, turn around. Catch my painter. Don't row too fast. Don't look as if you're hurrying. Easy now, and don't look at them. (lively dance music) - [Dot] And thus the intrepid outlaw, aided by his faithful band, once more eluded the sinister vigilance of the Margoletta and her crew. - I'm quite sure you're capable of taking Teasel down past Great Yarmouth. Dick and Dot know enough now to do exactly as you tell them. - It's not the sailing I'm worried about. It's the Margoletta. - (sighs) Yes. - Perhaps we'd better not take the Titmouse. If George Owdon tells the Hullabaloos that she belongs to me, they're bound to find me. - Then we must disguise her. - [Dot] And disguised she was. Tom agreed that Mrs. Barrable should paint out the name, and in order to make her look like Teasel's tender, the boys rigged a rope around her. She was transformed, and so the big adventure began, with enemies lurking everywhere. After a day's perfect sailing, they came to their first major obstacle, but once they had all helped to lower the mast, Tom single-handed towed them through. (upbeat music) (Barrable sighs) - [Dot] Well done, Tom. - Now let's find somewhere to moor for the night. (dramatic music) Good night, William. (suspenseful music) (boat engine whirring) - What's the matter? - Shh, look! - (gasps) They must have come here during the night, but we didn't hear anything. - We've got to get away, and quietly, without waking the Hullabaloos. - Right, I'll go and tell the others. - No, if we wake Mrs. Barrable and Dot, then William's gonna start barking. That's bound to give the game away. - Then what should we do? - First we think, then we need a plan. - Obviously heading downstream. - There's no other way. We're gonna have to double back on ourselves. You steer the Teasel. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (William barks) - William, be quiet. - What do you think you're doing? - Shh! - Why, what's going on? - Look. - (gasps) Margoletta. - [Dick] Shh. (dramatic music) - I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do, Tom. We must go back to Horning, have a counsel of war with your father, and perhaps take some legal advice. The twins' father's a solicitor. - You've asked my opinion. Alright, unmooring any boat is an offense, and to unmoor a cruiser with five unsuspecting people below in their cabins is a grave offense. - Yes, but they-- - Don't interrupt, Tom, there's a good fellow. - I know perfectly well why you felt you had to do it. Those people are objectionable, and they would have been responsible if the coots had deserted their nest. But they do have the law on their side, Tom, and your Coot Club doesn't. - By the same token, there isn't a single river lover who wouldn't approve of what Tom did. - Oh, I agree, and these, er, Hullabaloos, as you call them, know it, and it's made them even more determined to catch the culprit. And if they do catch you, Tom, it'll be very embarrassing for your father. I mean, after all, quite apart from him being a doctor, he's a magistrate. - Frank, are you suggesting that Tom should turn himself in before they can catch him? - No, but what I am going to suggest is this, that Tom makes himself scarce. Now he can either stay indoors for 10 days, or he could take Mrs. Barrable and the children off and away right away. You were thinking of going where, Mrs. Barrable? - Beccles, I spent most of my childhood there, you know. We might even go to Norwich. - Well then, nobody will look for a hauling boy that far south. You should be safe enough once you're on the other side of Yarmouth. - [Tom] Thanks, Dad. - I'm only sorry that the twins won't be going with you. - Oh, so am I, but it's understandable. They wouldn't want to miss the regatta. - True. Now then, if you leave early tomorrow, you should be off to a flying start with the wind the way it is at present. - So we'll leave from Horning's Staithe at nine. - Smashing, can I go and tell the others? - Cut along then. - And tell those daughters of mine to get along home. Otherwise, Mrs. McGinty will be on the warpath. - Yes, yes, I see. - Mrs. McGinty. - Sorry we're late. - Are you sure? Shh, are you there? - Morning, Ginty. - Yes. - Why is the aged P on the telephone? - Your father is on the electric telephone because of something important that came in this morning's post. Ha, important, to keep a body from his meal. - Nobody ever sends me any exciting post. - That's because you're so boring. - Who got outta bed the wrong side, then? - That's just about topped. - What's up, A.P.? - The law, as usual. Planned for months on having this week free for racing, and now this. - What? - An old client of mine has died and left his very considerable affairs in an unholy mess. I shall have to go to Newmarket and sort them out. Thank you, Mrs. McGinty. - Today? - Yes. - I'll get the girls' eggs. - But what about racing? - Forget the racing, darlings. This is going to take at least a week. - A week? - We shall have to scratch from every race. Look, I'm sorry, but it can't be helped. - A.P. If you're going to be away, what about our sailing on the Teasel? - With Tom and Mrs. Barrable. - And Dot and Dick. - Oh, yes, if they'll have you. - Have us! - Of course they will. - Alright. - Thanks, Daddy. - Tell Ginty, A.P., while we get ready. - Eh, send me a postcard from Beccles. If you remember my name. (upbeat music) - Come on. - Morning, Mr. Tedder. - Mr. Tedder. - Morning, my little beauties. What's the hurry, been robbing the bank? - No, just set fire to the police station. (upbeat music) Oh, no, they've gone. (Barrable humming) - Look, isn't that a bittern? - [Tom] It's a bittern alright. - [Dick] Will you log that please, Admiral? - 11:15, sighted a bittern. - And two redshanks earlier. - I got those. - When do we get to the hardest part? - Depends on the tide. We don't want to get to the bridge too early or too late. - Are you worried? - A bit, but not about you two or the sailing. - About the Hullabaloos? - Something Mr. Farland said last night, that if they do catch me, it'll look very bad for my father. A doctor shouldn't let his son do dangerous and irresponsible things. - [Port] They said they weren't leaving 'til nine. - Can't blame Tom, be making the best of the winds. - Look, the Sir Garnet. Jim, Jim Wooddall! - Sir Garnet, ahoy! - Morning, me old beauties. - Wait. - What's the trouble, girl? - We need your help. (upbeat music) We're bound to catch them up, aren't we, Mr. Wooddall? - Oh, should do, now the sail we now got on. Depends on when Tom set off, though. - We've got to catch them up, we've got to. - Trust old Sir Garnet, won't never let us down. (upbeat music) - [Dot] Of course, no one aboard the Teasel was aware that the twins were following in hot pursuit, and with a good wind and Tom at the tiller, they were soon approaching Yarmouth. - Hey. (suspenseful music) What do you reckon? - A woman, three kids. That'll do us nice. - [Brad] Tide's still running. - It'll come about soon. Wait for slack water. - [Tom] We're here too early, I'm afraid. We'll have to turn around and see if we can hang about a bit. - I'll leave it to you. - Ready about. - [Dot] Like all true navigators, Tom realized that timing was critical. He carefully explained to Dot and Dick that with two great rivers meeting, it was vital that the passage through Yarmouth took place only at low water. Once through, they would then have the full benefit of the flood tide to speed them on their way towards Beccles. - I'll take ya to Yarmouth, young sir. Come on now, bring her 'round in here now, and I'll hop aboard. - No, thank you. - We're in no hurry. - Come on, now, just throw it. Throw me a rope and I'll make you fast. Come on, now, come over to me and you'll be alright. - [Tom] We don't mind sailing until the tide's slackened. - You got some mud here, boy, you see. Come on, now, I'll make you see. That's it, Brad, we've got people here who won't see reason. - Attempt to board this boat and I'll see you both in jail. - Alright, lady, you want some help, don't come to us for it. Alright, Ben, alright, there'll be others. - What was that all about? - They're wreckers. - Wreckers, they only wanted to help. - Once they get aboard with an unsuspecting crew, they run them into real danger and then claim salvage for rescuing them. - Real wreckers. - Gosh. - They didn't fool Tom, though. - Standby to go about again. - Isn't this exciting? - (laughs) That's one way of describing it. - Take her down full way. Easy does it, nice. - You mean we have to stay here for the night? - [Starboard] It's only five o'clock. - Well, I'm sorry, misses, but we can't go any further. You come along with me and I'll show you why. Well now, it's like this, you see. We're here, now Tom got through the bridge 'cause he caught the tide run. We missed it, so we've got to stay here. No engine, you see? Reckon he'll be in Beccles by now. - How do we get to Tom? - Well now, bit of a facer, is that. - [Simon] Jim, there's Old Bob in the Come Along. He might know where the Teasel is. - Bob, these young friends of ours come to join a little old yacht, the Teasel, with Tom Dudgeon, Horning, aboard. Seen him go through? - Aye, went through the bridge at low tide, they did, headed towards Beccles. - We've come so far. - We can't give up now. - Hop you in, me old dears. I gotta go your way to fetch a yacht down what's missed her tide. Hop in, and we'll see if we can't catch that old Teasel. (Jim laughs) (upbeat music) - Bye, Mr. Wooddall. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Bye. - Bye! (upbeat music) - Rare little old gals. - What they got, what they got is grit. (upbeat music) - [Barrable] What do you think, skipper? Should we tie up here for the night? - [Dot] Let's go on sailing forever. We can take turns being awake. - We'll go on as long as the wind holds. - I say, isn't that the spoonbill over there? - What? - The chap with the hunched-up shoulders. - Must be, I've only seen them once. This goes down in the Coot Club book. - And in Teasel's log. - There are birds everywhere, wherever we look. Oh, Dick, isn't this heaven? (all laughing) (peaceful music) - [Jerry] Okay, Owdon or whatever you call yourself, where will I find him at the tide? - He's over near Beccles, just follow the river 'round, all the way around there. - Yes, I'm going to show you something very nice. Money, see this? This can be yours, that and more, if you come back with something a little more specific. See you here in about half an hour, okay, and I want some facts, okay? Alright, see you then. - Reckon we can sleep under here real comfortable. - Especially if your mum give us them mattresses. - She will, got 'em off my granny. She died last week. - That's good, then. - If only we had 10 pounds, we could fit out a proper cabin and have a little old stove. - 10 pounds, don't be daft. Take my dad a month to earn 10 pounds. - [Bill] Coots forever. - [All] And ever. - We've gotta think fast. - Why, what's happened? - I just seen Malcolm, he's our Coot in Wroxham. - I know who Malcolm is, now get on with it. - Well, his dad works at Rodley's Boatyard, and the Margoletta's laid up for repairs, but it's fixed now and it's setting out in the morning. - Where to? - After Tom. - But how did Malcolm know that? - [Bill] Malcolm's got big ears. George Owdon told him that Tom's gone down to Beccles. - [Pete] But did he tell him Tom's name? - [Bill] No, George wants that reward, but he doesn't want people to know it was him that named Tom. Them Hullabaloos is gonna catch him, and they're gonna give him the hiding of his life before they hand him over to the police. - We've got to find Tom to warn him. - But we're not gonna beat the Margoletta in this. - We can try, if we leave now and row and sail through the night. Come on. Right. - [Dot] Don't you feel a bit sad having been away from here for so long? - Sad, no, not a bit. I can't go on yearning for what was past or should I never enjoy the present, and the present's where we live. Now, first to find the general stores and the post office. I want to send a postcard to that. - [Dot] I fear that Mrs. Barrable does not possess the soul of a true romantic. (clock bell chiming) - Wonder when we shall meet Tom. - We've gotta press on fast. - Right, come on, then, keep going. - [Dick] What does he weigh? - One stone, three pounds. - What's his fortune? - You're a hard worker and should become successful. - (laughs) Good old William. - Ah, Tom, I shall read you what I've written to my brother. Horning yesterday, Beccles today, and not a scratch on her paint. That should put him in his place, I believe. William, how much does he weigh? - [Dick] One stone three. - You're putting on weight, William. - Here's his fortune. - Now it's your turn, Mrs. Barrable. - Right you are. Oh, what nonsense. (horn beeping) - [Dot] Look, it's Port and Starboard. - Look! - Hello. - What on earth are you doing here? - We've had such a time. Daddy had to scratch from the regatta because of his work, so we can sail with you after all. - Oh, good! - Super. - Then we tried to catch you up and caught a lift aboard the Sir Garnet. - Then we switched to that tug, the Come Along. - [Tom] Come Along, we passed her. - Then we spent a night on an old sailing barge. - My word, you have been clever. - I don't suppose you had time to find out what the Margoletta's doing. - We did, Jim Wooddall told us. - What? - [Starboard] It seems the Hullabaloos bashed it trying to go through Potter Heigham bridge at high tide. - They would. - So it's at Rodley's at Wroxham waiting for repairs. - Wroxham, thank goodness for that. Now I can really enjoy my sailing with them out of the way. (horn beeping) - Come now, we'll be getting on, thank you very much. - Bye bye! - Thank you very much! - Well, you're a good lad. You've certainly done your bit, so here's a quid. There'll be more like it when I can lay my hands on that little ruffian. Cast off, James. - [James] Righto. - Alrighty, Livy? - [Livy] Catch, Ronald. - But don't you tell him that I set you onto him. I've got to go on living here when you lot's gone. - I've never seen you before in all my life. - And don't you forget them Death and Glory boys. They're out to warm him you're on your way. - Oh, don't worry about them. We'll catch up with them and give them the fright of their lives. They'll never want to sail again when we've finished with them.

Daddy's sorting through his client's affairs quicker than he thought he would, so he'll be home tomorrow evening. - Yes, and he wants us home, then, too, so we can crew for him in the regatta. - Then you won't be able to come to Norwich with us. - Afraid not, but don't let that spoil your trip. - No, we can catch a bus back. - That's unthinkable when you've come so far to find us. - No, we'll all sail back to Horning. If we left now, we could get there by tomorrow evening, couldn't we, Tom? - Of course we could. - Right, off we go. William will be wondering where we go to anyway, come on. (upbeat music) (lively dance music) We're running very low on food and drinking water. We'll have to stop as soon as we can, Tom. Otherwise, we have a very dreary night ahead of us. - Oh, but it's rotten mooring around here. - I'll tell you what, we'll sail into Breydon Water and tie up by the pilot boat. - Good, oh, there's be lots of waders to watch now the tide's going out. - There are two houses marked near the mouth of the Broad. - Well, that looks like a farm. Let's go up there and see if they can sell us something. - I daren't, not with the tide going out. We might get stuck. If Starboard could take over and sail the Teasel around to the pilot and moor there, I could take the Titmouse and get the stores. I'll be back before you can get the sails down. - Right you are. Carry on. (upbeat music) - The wind's dropping. We wanna get to Tom before the Hullabaloos, don't we? - Of course we do. - Well then, carry on. (suspenseful music) Hide! - There ain't nowhere to hide. Anyway, they're after Tom, not us. - Those little beasts again. - There's no one else about. Give them a lesson they won't forget, James. (laughs) - Yes, let's give them the fright of their lives, the little swine. (dramatic music) - They're gonna ram us! (dramatic music) - [Joe] Near murdered us, you did! - And our grub's gone overboard. - I hope you sink and drown. - [Pete] You deserve to drown. - Is there anything else I can get ya? - No, I think that's all, thank you. - Well now, that's two dozen eggs, quart of milk, three loaves, and three pounds of bacon. That'll be six and 10 pence, ha'penny. Thank you. - Thank you. - 11 pence, seven shillings, seven and six, and half a pound makes 10 shillings, thanks. - [Tom] Thank you. - I'll give you a hand with these down at your boat. You've a lot to carry. - Thanks awfully. - You won't be needing all this in that little boat. - No, there's a yacht with me, the Teasel. She's moored 'round by the pilot boat. - Are you sure? The one I saw went right past it. - She didn't moor? - No, saw her clean past the pilot boat, what, 20 minutes ago. You'll have a job catching her. - I expect she's just gone exploring. She'll be back any minute now. - Well, I hope you find 'em. Low water, there's generally a mist rolls in from the sea. Gets thick as fog sometimes. Well, cheerio. - Cheerio. (somber music) - I don't like the look of this mist. I think we'd better turn back and join Tom. - Stand by to go about. - It's getting thicker. (William whines) - Teasel, Teasel, ahoy! Teasel, anchor, anchor. Teasel. Teasel, ahoy. - Titmouse, ahoy. (barks) - All together. - [All] Titmouse, ahoy! (sand crunches) - Teasel, I'm aground. Well and truly stuck. - [Starboard] So are we, and some of us are very hungry. (barking) - Why didn't you moor by the pilot boat as we agreed? - [Barrable] My fault, Tom. I suggested we did a bit more sailing. - I've got water, milk, bread, eggs, and bacon. - That's splendid, dear boy, but how are you going to get it to us when we're both aground? (birds chirping) (birds squawking softly) - [Tom] At least the mist seems to have lifted and the tide's on the turn. It'll be a long time yet, though, before we can float off. - [Dot] My tummy's beginning to rumble. - Tom, I'll wade across and get the food. - No! - No, Dick, no! You'll drown in that mud. - He's right, it's like quicksand. - [Tom] Couldn't you throw a rope across? - We'd never get it across. - But you can't just starve. - We shall have to until the tide turns. - There is one way we could do it, but I don't suppose William would like it very much. (upbeat music) - Now, William, this is your moment. Everyone has one, just once, when he has to be a hero or not think much of himself for the rest of his life. - [Dick] Call him, Tom, call him. - William, William, come one, come on, William. - You've just got to be a hero, I can't help you. - [Children] Go, William, go, William. - Hush, hush, girls, let Tom call him. - William, William, come, boy, William, come on. William, William, William, come boy. Come, William, William, William, come on. William, come on, William. (all cheering) - Well done! - Oh, William. (children cheering) - Well done. - Have you got the line? - Yes! - Then I'll tie on some rope and you can haul it across. - Right. Haul away. - Righto. - Have you had enough to eat and drink? - Plenty, thank you. - And is William happy and dry? - He thinks he's in a heaven for pugs. - (laughs) I'm sending over his cod liver oil in case he catches cold. - Fine. - Haul away. (suspenseful music) - Tide's fairly flooding in. I should be afloat soon. - Good, then you can come across to us. - Listen. - It can't be the Margoletta. - Tom! - Hide! - Hide, Tom, get down. - Tom, hide! - Shouldn't we hide, as well. - Stand still, everybody. They're bound to notice if we all suddenly disappear. (suspenseful music) (barking) (suspenseful music) - There he is. - I think they've seen us. - Look out, we're gonna hit the post! (shrieking) - Use reverse! (Hullabaloos shouting) - See what's happened down there. - Look under there. There's water rising in the front, we're going to sink. (Hullabaloos shouting and arguing) - Help us. - On the bonnet. (Livy shrieking) (water gurgling) - She's going to sink. - There's nothing we can do. (Hullabaloos shouting) - [Livy] Help, help us! - We can't swim! - We're still aground and we can't get off the mud until the tide rises some more. - We'll have drowned by then. - For God's sake, help us. - The Death and Glories. - Row, row! - Hurry, row! (everybody shouting) - Look. - Help! - Boys, row, Joe, row! - Row! - Come on! - Both of you, come on, faster. - Help! - Row! (everybody shouting) - Nearly there, come on. - In here! - Why don't you shut up! I'm in command here. - Oh, are you! (Jerry yells) - [Livy] Oh! - You oaf, help! - Help! - Get over here. You (sputters) over here, for heaven's sake. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Ow, I won't forget that. - They're saved, thank goodness. - Their troubles are almost over, William, but mine are just beginning. (horn honking) - These lads have now done as neat a bit of salvage work that I seen in 10 year. So you go to your telephone and talk to Rodley's at Wroxham and tell 'em that three little old boys have now saved the cruiser Margoletta from going down in the middle of the Yarmouth fairway. (Maude muttering angrily) - [Maude] Complete fiasco, farcical, almost instant death. - [Man] What are you doing with that? - I think it serves you right. - You might be mad. Why won't you move? - As soon as we get back on dry land. - Here, here. - If you hadn't been so keen on rushing after that little brat who unmoored us at Horning. - Who wanted action, who wanted revenge? Who wanted to see that little ruffian laid by the heel? - [Maude] You idiot. - Oh, but they're awful people, Tom. You mustn't give yourself up now. - And you swore you were a sailor. - You were perfectly happy to leave all the decisions to me until you pulled the wheel out of my hand. - I tell you this much, Jerry. If you think you're ever gonna get me to go on another holiday with you-- - Oh, shut up. - This is the brat who caused all the trouble. - I've come to say I'm sorry. - Sorry? - Sorry about casting your moorings off. I wouldn't have done it if only the nest hadn't belonged to such a special bird, but it was wrong of me to cast you off like that. - Special bird! Do you realize how much mischief you've done with your stupid pranks, you little savage? I'll see you in a magistrate's court if it's the last thing I do. - Leave him be. If it weren't for the likes of him and his pals, you and your parcel of fools would be laying down in five fathoms of water by now. - Who the devil do you think you are? - Oh, shut up, Jerry. You've made a complete mess of things and it's no good charging the odds now. - Do you have to keep us here? Can't we get on? - Take your hands off that boy. Do you know the meaning of gratitude? Those three boys have rescued your cruiser and saved your lives, and have I heard a word of thanks? Nothing but snarling and threats. Now be off with you before I really lose my temper. - Just a minute, you stupid old-- - Come along, Jerry. - You take your hands off me. Get out of my way. (William barking) (upbeat music) (man laughing) (children speaking faintly) (crowd applauding) - Death and Glory boys, thanks to your pluck and quick thinking, a major boating tragedy has been averted. You saved the lives of valued clients. When the Margoletta, the pride of our cruiser fleet, was in danger of sinking, you made possible, through your initiative, by towing her into shallow water, a brilliant act of salvage. You boys are a credit to your parents, to Horning, and to the Broads, and to all those who value life in this loveliest part of England. (crowd applauds and whistles) Now, Joe, Pete, Bill, step you up here. (crowd applauding) You and your crew salvaged the Margoletta, and in admiration, as well as by law, I'm bound to reward you. Joe, Pete, Bill, thank you very much. Well done, lad, well done, good. And now to the Death and Glory boys. ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ - Three cheers for Death and Glory!

(upbeat sea shanty) - Look! - [Dot] Gosh, they've hatched! - [Tom] And they've survived. - They've got you to thank for that, Tom. Aren't they lovely? Coots forever! - And ever! - We'd better get a move on if you're to catch that train. - Right, ahead both engines. - You will come back, won't you? - And have lots more adventures. - And sail in our little old boat. - Now we've got the cash money, we can do her up. - Yes, of course. - If Mrs. Barrable will have us. - I think that might be arranged. - And don't forget to send me the photograph of the house martin. - I shan't. (whistle screeches) - [Starboard] You will write to us. - Yes. - Promise. Goodbye, William. (children laugh) - Goodbye, all of you. - And thanks for the most wonderful holiday in the world. - Goodbye! - See you soon! - Bye! - Goodbye! (upbeat music)
