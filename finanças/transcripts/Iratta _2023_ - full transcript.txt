But his panic attack has occurred a couple of times now. That's not a good sign. Yes, I know. I'm aware of the personal problems between you two. But it's been so many years now, right? -Sir, the patient has been shifted. -Just… Okay. I spoke to her. What did she say? You can call Sreeja after five minutes. I have a surgery scheduled today. Anyway, you need to deal with this without getting stressed. I'll get going. This land became a lullaby A lullaby of the sky Sunrise and sunset Became swings for the lullaby Mornings told stories… Hello. Hello. Sreeja? Listen… please don't hang up on me until I'm done talking. Please. It's been 17 years. It's entirely my fault. I don't want to keep scores anymore. I was watching her on TV. In fact, I saw her on TV yesterday. She's such an amazing singer. I want to meet you guys. Both you and her! You should tell her… about me. She has the right to know that her father is alive. Sir? Sir, it's an emergency. Hello. -Actually-- -Hey! -We've received special orders… -Whom are you talking to? Hand it over! Take your cameras along and move outside. -Let us go inside, sir. -Why? Get out of here! Confiscate their phones and ask them to stand there! Okay, sir. Take their cameras away and get them out of here. -Give it! -We can't give up the cameras! -Come on, get out. -Why are you taking our cameras, sir? Get out of here! -Come on, wait outside. -Don't push me! -Don't you understand? -What's going on, sir? -I need my camera back, sir. -Leave… -Did you report it to the S. P. ? -Yes, sir. -Did you tell her about these guys? -Yes, sir. Hold this. Hey! You better tell me. Who among you did it?! Or the three of you will have to suffer together. Sir, there is a ruckus outside. Lock the gate! Go! What's going on? Make sure you lock the front gate. -Don't allow any of them to step out. -Okay, sir. -Do you understand? -Yes, sir. Let's get out of here. -But, sir-- -You guys can't leave. Please go back. -Why are you doing this, sir? -Please co-operate. I'm not sure when I can come back, dear. A mishap took place at the police station. Don't you understand? You've been asked to wait here for a serious reason. Everyone is waiting, right? Just listen to us. We don't know what exactly happened. We've received reports saying, "Gunshots were heard from inside". Neither the policemen nor any official has stated about this. DYSP Pramod Kumar has now arrived at the crime scene. Let's see what he has to say. People are in an apprehensive mood. Sir, what really happened in there? We've been told that gunshots were fired inside. Sir… -At least give us our cameras back. -Please understand… -What's our fault? We need our cameras! -Wait, sir is here. -Hold on, guys. -We've to get back to work. -Ask sir if we can get our cameras back. -Ask him! -This is not right. -We want our cameras. Greetings from Vagamon Police Station. Vinod! The gunshot was heard around 3:15 p. m. Approximately 50 people including media reporters, have been trapped inside this compound. Okay, Yamana. We will get back to you. A policeman at the Vagamon Police station has been shot dead. This is the most important news coming at this hour. The incident took place around 3:00 p. m. Right before the inauguration ceremony that, Forest Minister Geetha Rajendran was supposed to attend, three gunshots were heard inside the station. The reports say that three policemen from the same station are under the shadow of suspicion. Do any of them belong to our group? One of them is a District Committee member of our association. Okay. Are there reporters outside? Yes, madam. We need to close this case at the earliest. The Chief Minister has been pressurizing me. Yes, ma'am. Take down his details. Let us go. We've been waiting here for so long. -Wait for some more time. -Be patient. You need something to drink, sir? Your doctor called… to remind you about your medicines. Three entry wounds on the left chest. The distance between them is approximately three centimeters. At first glance, they seem like hard-contact shots. Note it down. There's a grease collar on the inner zone of the entry wound… and an abrasion collar on the outer zone. Greetings! Vagamon Police station. Sir. Yes, sir. The team is here to get the fingerprint, sir. Forensics is on the way. Sir. -Isn't the S. P. here yet? -No, sir. Greetings! Vagamon Police station. When did you leave the hospital? Just now, sir. What happened, John? I was investigating the case, sir. The woman is my relative. Her husband is out of town. He stopped by the house at midnight, under the pretext of investigation. When I asked him about it, he knocked my teeth out. A decision should be made on this, sir. If you give me a written complaint, I can take action. I have no problem doing that. But you'll be retiring soon. So, try and sort it out among yourselves. No, sir. Hey, ask Vinod to come in. Sir, you've been called inside. What's the issue between you two? Why did you stop by the complainant's house at midnight, for a case that John is investigating? I inquired about the complaint I received. When she asked me to come again, I went there. Aren't we supposed to go when the complainant calls? Why is he getting flustered about that? He is lying through his teeth, sir. Do you know what he did to the woman in the name of investigation? Sir, I need a solution… Please wait outside for a minute, John. If John files a complaint against you, I will have to take action. Settling your illicit relations is not my job! What did you think? Am I here just to sort out your issues? Oh! You've done so much for me, right? Are you planning to get me suspended now? That's all, right? I will accept it! And, about my illicit relations… I feel you should take care of your own wife and child first! You can lecture others after that! That'll not be a problem. Hey! I'll be visiting your friend again tonight to inquire about the complaint. Do you plan on coming along? The investigation of ASI Vinod's death is underway. For more information, we are joining our reporter, Athira. Athira, what is the current situation there? Which all senior officers are… -Has the death been confirmed? -Yes, ma'am. The doctor has confirmed it. Those three are the suspects. The room's that way, ma'am. Sir. The S. P. is here. Ma'am, we've found blood splatters from the pistol muzzle. So, we can surely say that… this is a contact gunshot. Three rounds are empty in the magazine. Those three rounds have struck the body. But one of them has pierced through the body. The remaining two must probably be inside the body. We have collected the gunshot residue from the hands. Have you found any chance prints? We haven't found any from the gun since it's covered in blood. But we've found a chance print from the pistol pouch lying on the table. To arrive at anything conclusive, we'll need to match those prints. Any evidence that leads to the three suspects? Ma'am, we have collected the fingerprints of those three policemen. We will match them and let you know. Ma'am, when we inquired about other policemen, we were told that those three held a grudge against ASI Vinod. We are questioning more policemen to reach out to some more leads. Condolence. Both of you step outside. Sir! For how long have you been posted at this station? It's been a year, sir. Where were you when this happened? I was talking to my wife over the phone. We added 0.25 kilos to it and made it 1 kilo. We'll make sure you remain locked in this time. Sir! -Yes. -Did you have food? Yes, I did. Did you take your medicine? Yes, I took it. -Well, did Benny call you? -No. -He didn't call you? -No. He had called me. Okay. Why do you sound weird? Have you boozed? You're drunk, right? -Why would someone drink on duty? -Sir… Well, Benny called to discuss the 75,000 rupees. -Sir… -I know! -We can pay the money, right? -What? The money he asked for. Didn't you understand what I said?! -What did you say? -Ask him to get lost! You won't pay the money? No, I won't. How can you say that? We promised to pay him, right? No, I won't! You call and tell him this yourself. Just do as I say! Don't make him angry! -You know his job, right? -Okay. If that is his job, this is my job. What is wrong with you? He doesn't know me well enough. -Joy had called too. -And? He asked me to pay the money and settle it. Will you just hang up? -Sir… -Hold on… -Madam! -Madam! -Madam! -Sir! We've been here for over an hour now. Why have you held us here? Look, we can understand your situation. Why have you seized our cameras, madam? We are just doing our jobs, right? -We've been getting calls from our office. -We're under pressure. Copy the footage and give us our cameras. A policeman has died while on duty. So, we cannot allow anyone to leave this compound. You need to understand our situation too. We're also under severe pressure. -So, we can't let anyone out. -But, madam… -Madam! -Please… -Madam! -Madam, please! What were you doing there when the incident happened? I was in the bathroom. The moment I heard gunshots I rushed out and saw that John sir and Bineesh were already there. What was the issue between ASI Vinod and you? Well, that… He kept it shut for four months, sir. It was the Panchayat President who intervened and opened it. He has done this deliberately, sir. -It's not like that, sir. -It is, sir. It's a drinking water problem that affects ten to fifteen families. He killed a dog and dumped the carcass into that well. Did anyone see him doing that? I saw it, sir. What did you see? Put your hands down! I saw him dumping the carcass into the well. Just a minute, sir. DYSP Pramod and I were classmates. So? Did DYSP Pramod give you the license to dump a dead dog inside the well? He is your brother, right? You can ask him about me. Is it my job to inquire about you? Hey, accept this complaint and get the squad to investigate it. Go away! Sir, did you see my daughter? She was with Vinod sir. Why would anyone bring their kids to the station when Vinod sir is present? He isn't someone who differentiates between kids and grown-ups. Amrita! Buy your kid something to eat once in a while. I have a soft spot for children. You have a problem with that? You should ask your dad to bring you down this slope. Okay. Yeah… Down you go! Rani! What's up? Sandeep is out on duty. He asked me to drop your kid home. Let him know that I did, okay? Here you go, dear. He'll be stressed otherwise. -Okay then. -Grandpa! Hey, did you take my biscuit? Get me a strong tea. Who asked you to pick my daughter up from school? You scoundrel! Who do you think you are? Your bloody-- You! Sir… Hey… Sir! Sir… Sir, stop! Sir! Sir… Sir… Sir! Sir… Sir! Sir… -Sir, let him go. -Please let him go. -Sir… -Hey! -Leave me! -Please, sir… -Leave me! -Let him go, sir. -Hey! -Sir… -Let go of me! -Sir… Leave me! Hey! Get the guy from the lock-up. Okay, sir. Bineesh, where is the key to the cell? Sir! It was lying there. -Sir! -Sir! -John sir! -John sir! -Sir! -Sir… Put him down there. Sir! Sir! -John sir! -Sir! Sir! -Bring some water. -Bineesh, you've been called. -Sir… -I'll handle him. Yes, ma'am. I got here 20 minutes ago, ma'am. We are interrogating them, ma'am. I'll keep you updated, ma'am. I will inform you, ma'am. Madam, we've matched the chance print. The impression on the pouch matched CPO Bineesh's right index finger. It must be him! Can we accuse him just because his print was on it? He was on guard duty. His print would definitely be on the pouch. -Okay, I'll call you. -Okay, ma'am. Come, Bineesh. It was your gun, right? You killed him, right? Sir, I was on sentry duty. I had to use the toilet so I left the pistol on the table. -That's when-- -Couldn't you give it to someone else? I didn't take the gun home! I left it at the station, right? When nature calls, how can I hand over the gun to the officer who's near the stage? You can take action against me for that. But don't try to frame me for this murder. Hey! What was the issue between Vinod and you? I never lied, right? Hey, sort it out if you can. He's been after it for so long. Roy, I never said he's lying. If such things are not dealt with properly, we will end up in trouble. You understand? Sir, Vinod sir is drunk. He's even gambling his bike away. Please talk to him, sir. -Such a nuisance! -Please check on him, sir. Go on. Go and check on him. You know how he is, right? I understand. But you should go. I am gambling on my bike, not yours, right? This isn't the first time I'm playing after losing all my money. The past is the past. Place your bet if you have money. I've already lost my money and you decide to blabber? What did I blabber about? Why can't I continue playing with this bloody bike? It's not right to utter cuss words when playing cards. Did you lose money too? It was my money, right? Don't be a spoilsport! Just play! What is your problem if I gamble on my bike? -We are placing bets with money, right? -Tell me! I have played like this earlier. -Don't be a spoilsport! -Just play! -Sir. -This is cheating. -You can't cheat this way… -Enough, sir. Who are you? Who asked you to come here? Mind your own business and leave. He has come to advise me! Hey, serve the cards for me too! -Serve the cards. -Stop it! Don't create a scene here. We all are players here. I don't have any money left to place bets. Here's my bike. You can play only if you have money. Don't act like you are at the police station. It won't work here. Act like this elsewhere. Leave this place. -Anyone else wants to place bets? -No. Mark it. You don't have money to place bets, right? Why won't you show me your phone? What's the matter? What were you thinking? Show me your phone. Why should I show my phone? I saw you shooting a video. I didn't shoot any video. If you didn't, why are you hesitating to show me your phone? It's my phone. There are a lot of things in here. -This will be an issue. -What? -Hey! -I won't give you my phone-- Try creating an issue then! -Show me your phone. -I saw you shooting a video. -And you are lying now? -Hey, hold on! -Move aside. -We saw you. -Stop fooling around. -No, sir. I just came to check if they wanted food. What's the problem? -I didn't do anything. -He shot our video. -He shot it! -I just came to ask if they wanted food… and they started shouting. Hey, how dare you lie to our faces?! What were you doing? -Show us the video that you shot. -Hey! Wait. Let me ask him. -Don't play games. -I told you, I didn't do it. I saw you shooting it. Move aside. I'm talking to him, right I said I didn't do it! -Hey! -Yeah? Wait… -What is it? -Sir… They're saying Prashanth shot a video of them. They are lying, sir. I didn't do it. I'll slap you if you keep lying! -You won't… -Stop it. They were boozing, sir. Did we buy liquor with your money? Hey, you! -How old are you? -Let go! She is just 17, sir. -Why do you care? -Shut up! Did you come here to screw a minor? Hey, mind your words! Did you come here to screw her? -Get lost, you fucker! -Mind your words! -Leave me! -Sir… -Hey! -Sir! Hey… -Sir! -Let go of me! -Let go of me! -Sir! No, sir! You! Lift him. Lift him quickly! No! Walk quickly! -Keep his head up. -Careful! Come on, hurry up! Quick! Hold him! Get the vehicle quickly! What a mess! Hey, Bineesh, Vinod sir is by himself there, right? Would he do something nasty? The girl is there too. Hey, stop the vehicle. You guys head straight to the hospital. Call me when you reach there. -Yeah, we'll call you. -Go. Stop! I am a policeman. Drop me off at Ambadi lodge. AMBADI LODGE Okay. Thanks. Hey, where are the others? All of them fled immediately. Look, Vinod sir hit me as well. What about the couple? He chased the guy away. And the girl? She's in the room upstairs, sir… Vinod sir! Open the door, Vinod sir. What you're doing is awful! Open the door, Vinod sir. Vinod sir! Hey! I reported it to the higher-up with the information the receptionist gave me. I argued with him at the station again… regarding the same issue. What happened to that case? I inquired into it. The lodge staff said that nothing of that sort had happened there. I found the numbers of the couple and called them too. They didn't have any complaints either. They didn't belong to this state. You should find out where they are, or if any of their contacts are in this compound now… at the earliest. I was asleep, sir. I woke up hearing the gunshot. Then… I think I saw someone running through the back alley. I think so. Where does this way lead to? There's a bathroom there. But, I doubt anyone uses it. Then why is this left open? This is a smoking area. Did you question the other policemen? They are currently being questioned. -Make it fast. -Okay. Ma'am, your phone! -Sir. -What does the forensic report say? The fingerprint matched one of the suspects. Can you expedite the remaining procedures? Sorry, sir. There's a technical difficulty in doing so. We can't accuse him with that print alone. Then, what's keeping you? I have a meeting with the CM in a few minutes. Get it resolved immediately. Okay, sir. Dude, explain the situation to him. They have seized our cameras here. We can't leave this place. We had to create a ruckus to get our phones back! No. We can't record anything here now. They have assigned two policemen to keep an eye on us. What was your duty there? Sir, Zacharia and I were… Sir… How is it going? Two more statements and we're done. Bring the reports to Mr. Saji's table once you're done. -Don't be late. -Okay, sir. Okay. Along with Zacharia? -What's the update? -Sir… None of the other cameras have it, right? No, sir. -Was this the only camera with visuals? -Yes, sir. -Did you check the rest of the cameras? -Yes. None of the other cameras got visuals. How was Vinod and Pramod? They have been at loggerheads for a long time now. I've known this for the past 17 years. A few years ago, when Pramod's wife went missing… Vinod and I handled that investigation. A FEW YEARS AGO Excuse me? -Can you take us to L. N. Krishna Nagar? -Get in. Come. Get in. Parel Post Office. Jeethabhai building. Stop here. Here. It's that door right there. Can we go this way? Yes, go straight. We have to go this way. No, sir. Rajendran was here. He helped us. We are right outside the house, sir. She's… not at home, I guess. Yes, sir. Sir. I'll keep you updated. Sir, she's here. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Lakshmy, you go in first. -Sir. -Yes? You can come inside now. Lakshmy told you everything, right? We got this complaint a year and a half ago. Who has the complaint? This is my life. This is my decision. My daughter and I are okay here. No one has to get stressed, thinking about us. It's not like that. When you suddenly disappear with your three-month-old child, Pramod, the guy living with you, will have some problems, right? There's a complaint against him too. That's none of my concern. I am not interested in discussing the past. I have nothing to do with him. It's not that simple, right? We've come here all the way from Kerala. We have to report to the department saying that… you and your child are both alive and safe here. Lakshmy, note down these details. -Sir. -Okay then. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Well, we just left the house. We discussed it in detail. Yes. We're outside now. -Yes, sir. -Sir? You carry on. I'll be right back. I told her, sir. Hey, Pramod. How long will you roam this way without getting back to work? Issues between you two are normal between any husband and wife. You need to understand that. I know that you stopped drinking. But she doesn't know that, right? That's why I am saying this. You should call her… and apologize to her. If both of you keep holding on to your ego, things won't get any better. You know that there are people who are laughing and all happy looking at your current situation, right? Just think about it. When it's over, so they say It will rain on a sunny day I know Shining down like water I wanna know Did you find anything after you went sniffing in Bombay? Why do you ask so? Did you think I won't know anything because I am under suspension? We went to investigate a case, right? If we get a complaint, we will investigate it. I know who the complainant is! I just have to put an end to his gall, right? I am the complainant. Will you cure my gall? After knocking up a girl, you're preaching here, instead of taking care of her? Get lost, you loser! I have nothing to lose now! If you ever interfere in my life, I'll forget that we're brothers. The same applies to you. Set the left leg properly. A little more. Keep the head straight. Get the tape. Can we start the procedure, sir? Wait. Come. Let's sit inside. Ma'am… she's mourning. It will be better if we don't ask too many questions now. Let's see. Malini, I can understand your situation. But, we're under pressure to complete the procedures quickly. Do you suspect anyone in Vinod's death? Pramod, can you please wait outside? If at all he… disliked anyone… it was… this man! -Run! -Come on, run… Come on, fast! Throw it at him! Get it quickly. He will place it soon! Oh no! Vinod! Pramod! Step aside, I say! I won't allow this here! I'm the one who decides things here! You can't do this here! -Step aside! -No! This is my house too. This house was not built by your dad, right? -Step aside! -Didn't I tell you that I won't? You and your kids get out of here! -Mom! -Mom! There is a limit to being nice! This is my house. I will bring anyone I want! Who are you waiting for? Should I bring a platter to welcome you? Get inside! No! You bitch! You left arrogantly with your kids, right? Why should I bear your expenses now? Hey! Is this the place to unleash your violence? Is it? If you can't live together, it's better to go separate ways. Listen, you should bear the expenses of the children. I said you should bear the expenses of the kids! Did you hear me? I'll take one of them with me. Come! No! Come on! No, Dad! -Leave my son! -I don't wanna go! -Let go of him! -Come on! -No! -Come with me! Stop crying and come with me! Mom, tell him to not take me along. Mom! Mom, tell him to not take me along. Please! -Let me go! -Stop wiggling! Let me go! Stop there! -Let me go! -Hey, stop there! Let me go! Hey, you! What is it? How dare he stare at me! Vinod… You're moved out with your dad, right? There's no one there. Your mom and Pramod left yesterday. Didn't they take you along? -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! -Run! Is it our fault that your mom left you? Whack him! Chop him into pieces! Don't spare him! -When did it happen? -This morning. -Who saw it first? -His son. Vinod! Vinod! Sir. The surgeon has called you. This isn't something that happens in Kerala. Something like this could happen in North India. There, the Naxalbaris and Maoists throw bombs at police stations. They shoot policemen and kill them. But this is God's own country! It's the democratic state of Kerala with literate and cultured people! We should understand this. Don't share the details with anyone else until I say so. Understood? Trace a number I'm giving you and share the details immediately. Ma'am. What are these guys saying? This is terrorism sponsored by the state! An institutional murder! What is this state? Everyone from the Panchayat… The media… Ma'am, we found a call recording of Vinod, just two minutes before his death. -Okay. -There is nothing suspicious in it. -Can I play it? -Okay. Is everyone there? Yes, we are. -What about Gopan? -He's here. You come over too. Actually, the Minister's gonna be here. So, I'm stuck. -So you are not coming? -No. I'm going on a break. A break? I am planning something with my wife. You've turned over a new leaf after finding a new woman. It's good to change when a good woman enters our life. He was happy with her. How was the relationship between Malini and Vinod? They had no issues between them. Actually, after Malini came into his life, there was a huge change in his character. They were not officially married. Since how long have they been together? It's only been a while. I've known her for a while. Vinod met her for the first time when she came to the station with a complaint. Okay… What's the confusion? He attacked her again so they're here to file a complaint. Oh! I will call you right away. He'll call you in soon. Amrita, what's that case about? Don't bother, sir. Hallelujah! Hallelujah, Jesus! Hallelujah! Jesus… What's wrong, Auntie? Last night, her husband got home, cursed her and kicked her out of the house. Where will this poor girl go? -He beats her up daily… -Malini. saying that she's possessed. We are fed up, sir. We only have time to come here with complaints. -From Angamaly-- -Everything will be fine. Hey, Manoj! Wait, let me go in. -What is it, sir? -I called for Manoj. -Manoj isn't here. -Oh, okay. Call up Gopan… and ask him to go to her house immediately. It's a case of domestic violence. I didn't see Gopan. -I'll go instead. -Okay. How long have they been married? They've been married for eight years, dear. Some people at the church conducted their wedding. They hid the fact that he was unstable while they conducted the wedding. What happened today? She makes a living from the Rural Child Care center. The center has been shut for over two weeks now, sir. It's okay if he doesn't provide anything to her. But, he should at least give her a mat to lie down on. She will survive with it somehow. She doesn't have anyone who'd take a stand for her. Right? What is it, sir? What's going on here? We're having a prayer, sir. At noon? What's your name? Brother Samson Winfred Jose. What? Whose brother? I'm here as she filed a complaint against you. Why did you beat her up? Why did you beat her up?! It was a mistake, sir. Malini, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit you. My apologies. It won't happen again. I had an emotional breakdown yesterday. I promise it'll not happen again. I'm sorry, Malini. It won't happen again, sir. I apologize in the name of God. I'm sorry you had to come here. -Sorry, sir. -Come here. -I'm sorry, sir. -Come with me. -Sir… -Come with me. Your face tells me that you're a troublemaker. No, sir. If you dare to touch her again I will rip you apart! Understood? Understood, sir. -Understood? -Yes, sir. He won't cause any trouble hereafter. Shall I leave or are we going to continue praying? Hey, get going. If he creates any more trouble, just call me. Okay? Let me see your phone. Here's my number. You can call me anytime. Shall we leave then? What do you guys think about that guy? Oh, what do I say, sir? Are there any relationships without issues, sir? Take me for example. When he's drunk, Saji is a different person altogether! The absconding Pulleri Santhosh… is now under Upputhara mobile unit's custody. So, all the mobile units… should stop searching for Santhosh… and get back to their other duties. All station mobile units. From Control. Upputhara mobile unit answering, sir. Pulleri Santhosh who was taken into custody has escaped again. Hello. Hello. Hello? Turn the vehicle around! Quickly! Open! Open it! Hey, help! Open! Open it! Open the door! Open it! Open! Open! Open! Open it, Devil! Welcome, sir. Come! Come on, sir! Come! Come on! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God, who is guiding me! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Devil! This Devil! Devil! Devil! Devil! Devil! Devil! Devil! Unlock the door. Let me see your hand. Come… -Step aside! -Move! -Move aside… -Walk! He is a lunatic, sir! Please move aside, sir. Take her to the hospital. -God will punish you! -Okay, sir. Get inside! The girl hasn't eaten anything yet. Why didn't you eat anything? Where's the lady who was with you? I will only understand if you speak up. Have your food. Hey, Malini has been discharged in the morning. I'll get you your medicines, okay? Is there someplace you can go? Come. Only this room is fit for use. The rest of the rooms are all dusty. Come on in. Hey! Let's call it a night. I have loads of work in the morning. I need to go to bed early. Only a little is left. That's enough. Get going! Okay then. See you tomorrow. Okay? Okay then. -Okay, good night! -Okay! -Let's go. -Good night! You didn't eat yet? Let bygones be bygones. There's no point talking about it now. Hello. Yes, sir. I heard you took the girl to your house post-discharge. I just helped her since she had nowhere to go. You're being totally reckless. Where is she now? She was with me yesterday. She went missing in the morning. Vinod, this is a woman's case. She's not like the women you generally deal with. She is going through a lot of problems. If she does something drastic, you will be in trouble. I won't be there to support you all the time. Go and try finding her. I asked this old hag to go stay where the Church folks take her. My parents were born to just trouble me! I can't look after you! Is Auntie here? It's the police. I stopped here as I was passing by. You did a good thing by taking that girl along. She must've had a peaceful sleep after a long time. Anyways, no one's gonna trouble her again, right? God will bless you. Okay then. RURAL CHILD CARE CENTER It was a mistake. I… Do you have somewhere to go? I will drop you off there. Come with me if you have nowhere to go. This won't happen again. It's my promise! I made tea, the way I like it. Try it. It's a sari. Don't wear the white sari anymore. Do it only if you want to. Also… your job at Anganwadi… you can continue working there. I'll arrange an auto-rickshaw from here. No one will do anything to you. This is something new Something I want to know I feel her love within me Because of her gaze into the horizon It's as deep as the ocean It's the nectar from the ocean churn I feel her love within me 'Cause of her gaze like the smashing waves There will be many issues along the way Simple issues will Get complex because of love's play Some flaws will shrink because of it Some wounds will disappear because of it A virtuous path will appear because of it In my mind, Rights will deflect like arrows In the shelf of memories In the winery of pains I am the thirsty one Oh, the sap of lemon! Along with the wild bamboo You hum like the sound of birds I, the sad one yearns to hear it Happiness of sympathetic Slow blowing winds Bundle of light from desire Burning all by itself Walls inside are falling When several stories become known Mind gets filled because of that Inside, I am down with love Oh star, oh stone in the ring, Whom did you hurt? My mind desired a little, by itself My twilight love, my magical chill Oh dark rainy cloud with a beautiful body Don't hide your beautiful light Don't stop humming, Oh, lullaby of a bud The cuckoo flew It sang along with the spring winds It flew across the world and sang And danced to the song's tune Sparkling snow melted Unfolded the umbrella of feathers Standing alone on The river bank in the valley Look, the point I'm trying to make is that… nature has a law… which is, to grow. Be it a tree or a human… it's all the same. The years when we were growing up… all the situations that we faced… have influenced us… in different ways. Us, policemen… when we study cases, we see that… the main factor that influenced… the lives of several criminals, is their childhood. There may be many other reasons for that. Negligence from parents, the insults they suffer from society, and several other factors. Some could overcome those and some couldn't. I don't remember the names of the teachers who taught me. But I clearly remember the name of my kindergarten teacher. Ms. Lathika. She was my mother's friend. Some people got shattered living with childhood trauma… and some people lived and prospered. Malini! Come. Enough of this class. Come. Let's go. What are you thinking? Come! Sir. The transfer that you got me… I dealt with it. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. Come on. SEMINAR FOR TEACHERS OF THE RURAL CHILD CARE CENTER Sorry. Why didn't you leave the moment you knew he was conducting it? I've told you about it, right? Malini! Mal… Hey! Have a drink, if you want to. No one will know. I'll have company and you'll feel relaxed as well. Never mind. I won't force you. We shouldn't force anyone to booze. That's the policy of us alcoholics! It's good, right? People in the neighborhood have started smiling at me now. An embarrassed smile. Every woman who came here never stayed longer than a day. You're the first one who did. Well, I never let anyone stay. I don't trust anyone. I've never had anything good in my life. It was all filth! I am filthy! We haven't received any further information yet. The minister is here. Let's hope we get some answers. -Madam! -What's your response, madam? Stop the vehicle. -Minister! -Madam, tell us what happened. Isn't it a grave failure that the culprit hasn't been caught… even after several hours? The investigation is underway. We cannot disclose more information. It's been six hours since a policeman died. Were you able to reach a conclusion so far? I told you, right? All the officers are here. The investigation is underway. So we cannot disclose any more details. But, until this case is solved, I will be staying here. That's something I can guarantee you. -Ma'am… -Last question… You can take the DYSP's room, ma'am. -Let us go. We're here since noon. -Hey! We're here since noon. Our children are home waiting for us. Why aren't you letting us go? You should let us go! Hold on… -Did you get their details? -Yes, ma'am. -Why are they still here then? -Procedures… -Drop them off at home immediately. -Yes, ma'am. You'll be home soon. Where is ASI Vinod's wife? She left for home just a while ago. What's the update? The investigation is on, ma'am. I am under a lot of pressure from the Chief Minister. It's already been four to five hours. What are you doing? We cannot do further proceedings until we get the autopsy result. You heard my conversation with the reporters, right? I will stay here until this is resolved. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. As I said earlier. All three rounds had pierced the body through this area. The first round hit the uniform whistle, pierced through the chest… and exited through the back. The second one hit the rib… and fractured it. It was the third one that pierced the heart. That was the cause of death. What was the range of fire? Point blank. The powder particles and burning… were found inside the wound track. So, we can confirm that it was point blank. It's Thomas from Cyber Cell. Yes, Thomas. Pramod here. I need call details for the past two weeks of deceased ASI Vinod. Sir, we received a call from Delta-2. He said that he's investigating this case and that… we should not share any call details, no matter who asks for them. Also… I need to tell you something, sir. He asked me to fetch your call details for him. I'm not interested in talking to the media right now. Can't you understand? Okay, then. -Satish. -Yes, ma'am. -Did you inquire about the pastor? -Yes. He is in a mental asylum. He escaped from there once. But, was caught again. I've confirmed that. I have to talk to you about something, madam. Come. Do you suspect me in this case? Why do you ask so, Pramod? When I requested Vinod's call list to the Cyber Cell, they said that they have been instructed not to give it to me. They've also been asked to trace my phone. Who told you that? Ma'am, CPO Bineesh, one of our suspects… called Pramod immediately after the incident and told him everything. He was Pramod's driver for five to six years. So what? Does that make me the accused in this case? If Bineesh has committed this crime, will you make me the co-accused… and prove in court that I hated Vinod so much that I would kill him? Everyone is aware of the issue between the two of you. What issue? What are you hinting at? Is it the issue between Vinod and myself? The deceased is my sibling. There's no doubt about that, right? I need to know the truth behind this too. Madam, please let me be a part of the investigation team. Please. You can join. Thank you. Come, Bineesh. Tell me everything. What happened? Sir, I told you, right? I was on guard duty then. Just call him tomorrow. -Mr. Paul? -Yes. -Please watch this set. -Okay. Please watch this for two minutes, sir. -Call Sandeep. -Sir. Mr. Sandeep… Where were you at the time? I was in the toilet, sir. He was in the toilet too! Were you together there? Well, I… What? Sir, I made a mistake. Actually, I was in the ladies' toilet. Who was it? You step outside. Was he with you when the gunshots were heard? Don't you know? Was he with you or not? Was he with you or not? Please don't put me in trouble, sir. I have a husband and a child. Please. Did you check the CCTV visuals? We checked the ones outside, sir. But the camera inside is not working. -Did you copy the TV crew's footage? -Yes. -Open it. -Okay, sir. Ask him to stand there. How are you feeling now? I have nothing to do with this, sir. Please exempt me from this. I don't know anything. Play. IDUKKI DISTRICT POLICE STATION Rewind it. Pause. Zoom right there. -Open it. -Sir. Where were you when the incident occurred? Here. Don't lay your hands on me unnecessarily, sir. Where did you go from here? I will frame you for this murder! Where did you go? Tell me. -Please watch the set. -Okay. -Get them out. -Sir. Don't let anyone come inside. -Inform the District Police Chief. -Okay, sir. -Hey, alert the sentry. -Sir. Don't you understand? Why are you here? Get out! When I looked inside, he was sitting here on the chair. I think there was someone else here as he was facing in this direction. I saw only him. KEY HANDOVER CEREMONY BY KERALA POLICE HOUSING CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY Abhilash! It's been 12 hours since the incident. I have to leave this place at the earliest. I'm not here for a permanent stay. Do you understand? We are trying our best, madam. Don't say anything! Just do as I say! Arrest those three policemen and tell the media that they are the accused. That's not possible, madam. We cannot come to a final decision without getting the GSR report. Don't give me jargon like GSR and stuff. Get things moving immediately. Do you understand? Madam, I am DYSP Pramod. ASI Vinod, the deceased, was my younger brother. ASI Vinod… committed suicide. Suicide? What are you saying? Out of the three bullets that struck Vinod's body, the third one that pierced his heart caused his death. They were fired at point blank. If someone else had done it at close range, there would have been signs of struggle. The position of the body would have changed, and the gaps between the gunshots would have been long. But… at the crime scene, there are no signs of such movements or any use of force. Also, the gaps between the entry wounds are short. Where are you going with this? Who commits suicide by firing three times? Will anyone in this world believe this? Tell this to someone else. Madam, out of the gunshot suicides across the world, four percent were multiple gunshot suicides. There were even instances of people firing seven bullets into their bodies! In our state, similar cases have occurred in Kannur. Why would a person who was happy just before the incident, suddenly commit suicide? There should be a reason, right? Would the media believe this? There are eyewitnesses, madam. An eyewitness? Abhilash. Tell us what you saw. Don't be afraid. Say it, dear. Say it, dear. We were playing cricket on the other side. While we were playing, the ball landed on this side. You hit it, right? Go, get it. Come. How did you realize that these children saw it? In the footage that the TV crew had shot, there were visuals of these kids playing on the adjacent ground. When I heard about today's incident… and reached the gate, I saw their dog leaving with a ball in its mouth. Things became clear when I investigated in that direction. The reason for his suicide? We have to investigate that, madam. This land became a lullaby Sir, this was sent from the channel. This was the TV program that was playing while he died. Sunrise and sunset Became swings for the lullaby Mornings told stories Nights played dreams Clouds poured rains In budding new strings of sounds This land became a lullaby When other kids went for music classes along with their parents, she used to go… Hey, is everyone there? Yes, we are. -What about Gopan? -He's here. You come over too. Actually, the Minister is gonna be here. So, I'm stuck. -So, you're not coming? -No. I am going on a small break. A break? I am planning something with my wife. You've turned over a new leaf after finding a new woman. It's good to change when a good woman enters our life. Okay, then. We are starting. Enjoy! Let's give a round of applause for Swetha's mom who supports her like this. This land became a lullaby A lullaby of the sky Sunrise and sunset Became swings for the lullaby Mornings told stories Nights played dreams Clouds poured rains In budding new strings of sounds This land became a lullaby A lullaby of the sky Sunrise and sunset Became swings for the lullaby Sir, watch this for a minute. Was this the girl you saw at the lodge? Yes… It was her. It's the same girl. POLICE STATION Hello. Hello. -Are all the proceedings over? -Yes. Our daughter will be coming today. I'm gonna tell her about her father today. And then, we'll come there. No. Don't tell her anything. She shouldn't know any of this. She must never see my face! Don't ever call me again. Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello?
