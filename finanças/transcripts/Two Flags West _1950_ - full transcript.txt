I understand you men were all part of General Jeb Stuart's own cavalry. We reckon we still are. I'll be brief. This war is over for me. Some Chattanooga swamp fever .. and this. Are on the ticket that's sending me to New Mexico. I don't mind saying that I'd be proud to have you with me as a unit. Officers and men. Why don't you come along? The war is certainly over for you. That's a fact. And my offer is a way out of this stinking pest-hole. Out? And the only way out. Easy, Ash. There will be no further exchanges of prisoners of war. General Grant's order of August 19th is final. Ain't we never going to see home again? Is your senior officer here? Would he be out picking flowers? Say Colonel, the Captain wants to pass the time of day with you. Are any of the other outfits accepting this? Technically, the offer is open to all prisoners of war. But in Indian country what we need is cavalry. Colonel Tucker is of the 5th Georgia, sir. Captain Bradford, late of the Pennsylvania 1st, Colonel. "Clay" Tucker, isn't it? - Yes. This is rather unusual. I am authorised to offer you a commission. Are you tempting me, Captain? No. As a matter of fact, I'm offering you a demotion to 2nd Lieutenant. If you will accept it. You say we southerners won't be asked to fight against our own? That's right. You fail to mention how many northern troopers we'll be relieving to do that. There are no troopers out West who can be relieved, Colonel. They are either greenhorns or casualties like me. Colonel Tucker. I hope you won't be offended if I remind you of an officer's duty to his men. What duty is that? - To conserve their lives. You would do it in battle. I can't imagine that you're happy .. just sitting here. Useless to the South or anyone. The Colonel don't need no reminding of his duties. He's brung us through more tight squeaks than .. - Enough. I beg the Colonel's pardon. Alright. I'll lay down the deal plainly to all of you. It is no charity picnic you're invited to. It's a soldier's life at forty cents a day. There will be fighting and there may be men killed. But a doctor for your sick, food for your bellies .. Reins in your hand and a horse to ride. Take an hour, think it over. Bullseye, Sarge. Got to keep his hair parted. Who are they, Yank army? Come on, yellow-bellies. Say, you've been wrong about everything you been fighting for .. All your women have been starving for. I don't know, Cy. I'm as good a Georgian as the next man, I reckon. But I'm hungry to eat some dust and a man likes to ride. We're just rotting here. If it ain't the fever it's the dysentery. Ten more, just last month. Tell us what to do, Colonel. - No. No, I won't tell you what to do this time. Each man must make his own decision. There is just one thing. We've been through some tight squeaks since the start, and .. I hate to see us split up. So why not stop chewing on each other and take a vote? What about you, Colonel? I'll go with the majority. Alright, all you southerners, come on this side of the room. You Dusties, come over here with me. Hey, you squatting in the middle. You make up your minds. Stand still so I can count you. Twenty one for leaving, Colonel. And twenty one for staying, sir. Hey, wait up now. Ash Cooper ain't voted yet. Hey Ash, what do you say? Ash won't be voting, sir. Now it's a dead tie. Looks like you'll have to settle it, sir. I reckon you know how I feel about this, Cy. I'd like to stick here until it all freezes over. That's it. If we could possibly serve any good. I vote we go. I don't believe it. - Cy, I want to live. Say I want to get home someday and not in a pine box. Put it any way you like. We'd have clawed our way out. We'd have used our teeth. I'm sorry, sir. This way is hotter, I'll admit. But even if we do have to put on Yankee uniforms. I've got to get us out of here. I beg your pardon, Colonel Tucker, sir. "Lieutenant" Tucker. Yes, sir. Lieutenant. The boys want to know if they can sing in this army. Oh, sing away. Thank you, sir. Much obliged, Colonel. I want you to know that I will be happy to be riding with you and your men. They'll be happy to be riding. Kansas City isn't far off. They'll have all the riding they want after that. Sing away, men. [ Singing: ] "Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton." "The old times there are not forgotten." "Look away, look away, look away, Dixie Land." "In Dixie Land where I was born in, early on a frosty mornin'." "Look away, look away." Just the thing for when we sashay into Fort Thorn. Hmm. "In Dixie Land I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie." "Away, away, away down South in Dixie. Away .." "Away, away, away down South in Dixie!" The Sergeant Major is with them ma'am. Dispatchers got through via Santa Fe Mrs Kenniston. Naturally Major Kenniston .. Oh, they'll be for ever and I've got news. So Sheridan has reached Hatcher's Run, eh? Yes, sir. And General Hooker is at Derby Town Road. "General" Hooker, now? That's what it reads here, sir. Well, well. Where is General Sherman, Duffy? General Sherman has resumed his advance south in Atlanta, sir. And where are we? "Guarding the great American frontier" they calls it. A bunch of one-eyed cripples. If you want my opinion of what they can do with the great American frontier .. When I want your opinion Sergeant, I'll ask for it. Henry, you'll have to stop this now. New troops are coming and I've ordered the Lieutenant .. Lieutenant Adams? - A column of reinforcements is coming. Did you let Mrs Kenniston go with the patrol this morning? It wasn't. A woman with a detail of only six men away from the Post? Well, I told them I had your permission. Well, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. You will confine yourself to quarters, pending further orders. But truly, he .. - That's all, Lieutenant. Yes, sir. It was all my doing. Why don't you confine me to quarters? Elena. Will you allow me to run this ragtag and bobtail army .. That the powers in Washington have done me the honor to let me command? Shall I turn out the guard, sir? You mean for our "Johnny Rebs"? Yes. Yes. By all means, Sergeant. I wish we had a band. We mustn't let these southern gentlemen think us lacking in hospitality, must we. Johnny, watch out for the horses. Them is Yanks, right enough. I'll say one thing, Sarge. In a company like this you're a rare pure beauty. There is the Commandant himself. Major Kenniston. Left front in the line. Troop, halt! Halt! Prepare to dismount! Dis-mount! Form right! Orderly, take the officers' mounts. Captain Bradford and detachment reporting for duty. My orders, sir. At ease! You are now part of the 3rd Cavalry of the Army of the Republic. Circumstances have placed you under my command. You've seen fit to swear allegiance to these United States. Thus gaining for yourselves a full pardon .. For recent offences of treason against this government. Your reasons for volunteering into this service it is not my intent to inquire. I understand you are good cavalry men. I'll be most grateful if in the future you will prove that that is so. Duffy, take charge. Attention! Mark, glad to see you. - Thank you, Henry. You'll be glad to see these others too. This is my friend Lieutenant Clay Tucker. Lieutenant Tucker. Captain Stanley will show you to your quarters, gentlemen. You will both do me the honor of taking supper with me tonight. Was that an invitation or an order? Like him or not, he's a first-rate soldier. I'm Stanley, gentlemen. Welcome. Captain. Well, figure it out for yourself, Captain Bradford. At any time the Apaches can throw a thousand braves against us. Fortunately, that's not the Apache way. They raid and run. What's this talk that it's Confederate influence which stirs up the Indians? With promises that they'll have this land back when the South wins. I understand you've had some rebel agents right around here. Now gentlemen, the war is a long way off. At least it seems so out here. Let's keep it that way, huh. I guess I owe you an apology. But the Lieutenant is on the right side now. Aren't you, Lieutenant Tucker? I'm just here to fight Indians, ma'am. Let us pray that we are all on the side of right. An excellent supper, Miss Kenniston. You are most kind. I suppose that after .. Were you imprisoned a long time? - Any time in prison is a long time. Perhaps you'd rather not talk about it? That's the way it is with Henry. Major Kenniston. He was imprisoned too. Then your husband has learned to value the smell of free air. My husband? What do you think of that, Henry? Tucker takes you for Elena's husband. A natural mistake. She is Mrs Kenniston. She doesn't forget it. But she is not my wife. I apologise, ma'am. I've been sitting here. I'm afraid I've been rude. I've been counting our blessings, as Reverend Simpkins would say. The reinforcements for which I've pleaded have arrived. A happy occasion. In honor of which I'd like to propose a toast. Elias, you've had enough. Mrs Magowan there is no such thing as enough. To our gallant cavalry. Which has always .. Mr Tucker. - Yes, sir? As Mrs Kenniston suggests, we have a lot in common. You were in Libby Prison I suppose, sir? A lot in common. Some minor differences. For example, our manner of gaining freedom. I didn't bargain for mine. I escaped. You were lucky. Lucky? Here is my luck. It was taken in the very first battle in which I was engaged. And I got that escaping from prison. It kept me out of action and sent me to this scabby post. While you at least had your chance to taste blood. Considerable blood if I have your record straight. Were you with Jeb Stuart from the beginning? I'm an ambitious man, Lieutenant. An ambitious man is very often a jealous one. So I'd like to hear something of your military exploits. Yes, sir. I was with General Stuart right up to Yellow Tavern. Were you at the First Bull Run? Yes, sir. At Gaines' Mill and Savage Station? - Yes, sir. At Cumberland Gap and Fredericksburg? - Yes, sir. Were you at Chancellorsville? Yes, sir. At Chancellorsville when .. when Stuart made his charge against Brown's Brigade? My squadron had the honor to lead that charge, sir. My brother, Elena's husband, was killed in that charge. My brother was killed at First Manassas, my cousin at Pittsburgh. Another cous .. Have I the Major's permission to see to the comfort of my men? Yes. - Thank you, sir. My deepest sympathy, ma'am. Captain Bradford, would you .. pour the wine. Mrs Kenniston's glass is empty. That's it, Henry. Teach 'em respect for their betters. Letting them into the Army is a caution, ain't it. Yeah, I guess they figured they're better off in our army .. Than running away from it. Come on, give us a pull, Herb. Pay day, pay day! Come and get your pay. One thing the rebels did, they brought us the pay wagon. Attention! At ease. Well, how are you fixed? - It's homey. As you see, sir. - We'll make that all right. Goodnight, men. Now ain't that touching. In their army the Lieutenant comes around to tuck them in bed at night. You ain't hanging no Reb' in here. Why you .. - Attention! It is my clear understanding that you're all part of one command at this Post. You will behave accordingly. Any repetition of such an incident will be properly dealt with. [ Bugle call. ] That's lights out, men. Lights out, soldiers. Give me that bottle. Oh the little darlings is being picked on. Oh, Tucker. You are from Georgia, ain't you? - Why? The Georgians are famous for their tempers. Hang on to yours, Colonel. Hang on. It's good luck I caught you before you got inside. Really, Brad? Of course. I've been very anxious to talk to you alone. I hadn't the faintest idea you were way out here with Henry. Yes. I'm here. I turned Washington upside down trying to find you. The Andersons told me you'd gone back to California. Well, as you see, I'm only here. Want to tell me about it? If you'd like. I wrote to Henry soon after he was sent out here. I wrote to him for help. I told him I wanted to go back home. That's a place called Monterey, isn't it? Yes. I told him I could get this far with an army supply train. He wrote back to come along. As soon as possible he'd send me on with an escorted wagon train to California. I've been here more than six months. Six? Really? Why, what's kept you here? There has been no chance to get any further. It was alright at first. I suppose it couldn't be helped. There have been no wagon trains getting through. No troops to be spared. One thing and another. Didn't he know he had no troops when he wrote me to come here? I suppose .. he expected reinforcements months before we came. I suppose he did. Well, now that we're here. I expect you'll be on your way again. - Oh yes. I must admit I'm glad you haven't gone yet. You know, Elena. You've been a great deal in my thoughts. Even when I didn't see you. They say that thoughts, like time, can't stand still. But time can stand very still. Goodnight, Mark. It was nice of you to have thought of me. Do you have to go in? It's late. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. - Goodnight. It's a real south-west night, isn't it. - Yes. That's a beautiful dress. I've worn black for more than a year, Henry. I was merely giving you a compliment, my dear. Thank you. There had to come a time you'd want to get out of mourning. Richard loved music. Even as a boy he loved it. I suppose you used to play for him sometimes in the evenings? Why yes. Sometimes I'd sing Spanish songs we both liked. He must have enjoyed that. You must play for me sometime. If you would like. Goodnight. Mighty windy country. This ain't even a breeze. Pretty hot. Wait until summer. Yeah? It was last August when Corporal Donnelan, rest his soul, got killed. He wasn't in Hades a week. His ghost showed at our quartermaster's one night a howling and a yelling. Do you know what he was after? His blanket. If you Yanks could fight like you could lie .. What did you think of her? - Who? Well if you can ask "who" I don't have to ask. What do you think about, by the way? About being a good little tin soldier. You know the first time I ever saw her I .. Fell head over heels. The first time I ever saw her she was being married to another man. Hey! Take a detail of six men down there. I'll send a wagon from the Post. Yes, sir. Apache? Maybe Apache, maybe Satank. Satank? - Kiowa chief. Big medicine man. He's worse than Apache. I'd better ride over and see if the Major has any further orders. How about it, Colonel? Can we? That's what they hired us for. Hugo, sound Recall. Have they got one, sir? It's the same you idiot. Sound Recall. It takes our fellahs to put 'em on the run. Sound it again. Halt! Forward! Who did that to us? You're forgetting we're in the Yankee army now. They calls their favorite tune. I told you they could ride. Troop .. halt! Whoa. Lieutenant Tucker. It's not my habit to reprimand an officer in the presence of enlisted personnel. But in this instance I consider it advisable to make an exception. I presume I am to commend your dashing southern spirit? Well then, I commend your spirit. But hardly your judgement. You'd have ridden in there alright exactly as the redskins wanted you to. Into a trap like ducks following a decoy. I venture to express the doubt that either you or any of your men .. Would ever have ridden out again. Do I make my point sufficiently clear, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. Forward to the right, ho! Follow me. Ride order. Mr Tucker. - Ma'am? This is the first chance I've had to tell you .. I'm very sorry for the embarrassment which was caused .. When you were a guest in our quarters. Generous of you, ma'am. Not at all. I'd understand that you don't hold me personally responsible .. For the killing off of your husband. I'm right relieved to hear that. I'm talking to you Mr Tucker because Fort Thorn is a very small Post and .. It seems unavoidable that you and I .. That all the people in it should .. - Be placed in close contact, ma'am? If you choose to put it that way. I understand. For the sake of the common good you're willing to overlook the unhappy fact .. That I was born a southerner? Are you laughing at me, Lieutenant? No ma'am, no ma'am. But it's on my mind it would be more important if the Major shared your .. Charitable sentiments. In your place Miss Kenniston. I'd be a little frightened of a brother in law who plainly believed in Suttee. In what? - Suttee. It's an Indian word. Hindu, not Apache. Excuse me, ma'am. Brad, are you any good at words? At words? There is a word I'd like to know the meaning of. Suttee. Suttee? Well, it's not so much of a word Elena as a .. As it is a custom. Hindu? Yes .. when a man dies .. His widow is supposed to throw herself on his blazing funeral pyre and .. Finish her life too. Oh. It's a very drastic kind of mourning, I'd call it. Whatever made you think of that? [ Spanish language ] I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish. Oh .. nothing. Noting important. Troop! Halt! Prepare to dismount! Dis .. mount! Forward .. ho! Congratulations on your knowledge of Hindu customs, Lieutenant. Thank you. I'll have you know, I'm not committing Suttee and nor is anyone forcing me to. I'm sure everybody will be mighty glad to hear that. It certainly would be a .. Sinful waste, Mrs Kenniston. Captain Stanley, you take the morning patrol as far as Puaki Crossing. Keep on the alert for any signs of Indian migration. Yes, sir. Captain Bradford. You will remain in headquarters. Prepare a full report on all field activities of the past thirty days. Yes? What's this, Duffy? Concerning the two prisoners, sir. You asked. - Oh yes. Yes. Lieutenant Tucker. Yes, sir? In the guardhouse are two renegades, Edwards and Fairchild. Convicted of running whiskey and guns to the Indians. Before you attend, send a detail to carry out the sentence of the court. They are to be executed and their bodies buried outside the Post. Your Sergeant, whatsisname .. Pickens? He should be able to handle it. At once, Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. The thing has dragged on for months. Mr Reynolds, your manning rosters haven't been received. See that they are turned in today. The horse has got a bad quarter crack here. Lieutenant Tucker, sir. The boys and me got to see you. - What about? We got to see you. Is something wrong? Take a look at that report, sir. Just look for yourself. We didn't know until it was too late. We didn't know. We've taken their muck as long as we can. Now you got to be with us or agin us. - Keep it, Cy. Keep it. Go back to your quarters. He won't be a minute. - Thank you. Yes, sir? Do you wish to see me, Lieutenant? - Take a look at that. What about it? - Indian whisky sellers and renegades. These men were agents of the Confederate Government. Spies? Yes, I suppose they were that, too. The one usually goes hand-in-hand with the other. Would you like to see the record of their trial? I've seen enough. Then, what is the point, Lieutenant? A detail of my men has been required to shoot to death two Confederate citizens. We came under the representation we need never do anything against the South. That's right. It never occurred to me. An order is an order. The Government made that promise. And I did. I'm not sitting behind a roll-top desk in Washington. I'm running an Army Post. What's the use of talking about it now. The sentence of the Court was carried out. The men are dead. Anything else? No. Nothing else. Nothing at all. I'm very sorry you broke that agreement. I assume naturally sir, that it was by accident, but just the same .. It only proves what I said about the Rebs from the beginning. Henry, you can't go on fighting the civil war out here. You can leave it open, Duffy. - Those men took an oath of allegiance. They took an oath to the South once too. Well then, put it this way. If you want a man to be a good soldier you must treat him like one. Do you take me for a fool, Mark? That man is a rebel to the core. He'll go over the hill the first good chance he gets. That's the only thing we can do. We get our gear together and our horses and .. I owe you all an apology. I was wrong. - We been talking .. The words of that oath we took back there are as hollow as a bell. The Major just cancelled the bargain. - So we're getting out of here, sir? How does it feel to be wearing grey again. Now let's be reasonable, Henry. If these men weren't sincere, why .. They had every opportunity to desert on the way over here from Kansas City. Nothing stood between them and freedom but me. Why didn't they go then? Perhaps you're right. - Don't you agree, Elena? These men have every reason to have strong feelings. Give them a little time. - Don't ask Elena. Her mind is full only of how she gets to California. Hang it all, Henry. Give these men a chance. Alright, I'll give them a chance. I'll give them their chance just as soon as possible. Good morning. - Good morning. This is what I like to see. We don't mind it ourselves. Sir, you have all the ammunition your requisition calls for. Well, let them take it, Sergeant. If they don't use it you'll get it back. We'll get it back alright. I wonder if I can ask you a favor - At your service, ma'am. I have my trunk all packed. I'll be travelling with the Simpkins and .. I wondered if some of your men if free, could take it to their wagon for me? You aren't going, Mrs Kenniston? What do mean? Of course I am going. Everything is arranged. I am all ready. Your name is not on my list. It was on it, but it was taken off. That's preposterous. You've made a mistake. Perhaps you'd better ask the Major. I only take orders. I must say we were disappointed. I .. The men and I were looking forward to the pleasure of your company. You understand Reverend Simpkins, you do this trip on your own responsibility? My good wife and I are fully prepared, Major. And we're very grateful for the hospitality. That's alright. That's all. Thank you. Who's next, Sergeant? - Mr Strong, sir. Strong! So, you're getting us off your hands, Major. You are a merchant by occupation? Right you are. You will find my papers in order. Just as a matter of curiosity, what are you doing in New Mexico? There must be more bustling fields of commerce. Just passing through. Back and forth. What's your destination? Now now, Major. You're downright suspicious of me. It's good. It's your duty. I think it's about time I came out in the open. I'm not what I seem. These are my credentials from the War Department. You are relieved, some, huh? Captain Bradford, will you excuse me. - Right, sir. Wait outside until I finish this. I'm very glad. - Glad about what? That you changed your mind. - That I changed my mind? Well, didn't you? I didn't ask the Major why. I just cheered. If you were really my friend, you'd want to help me. Then we understand each other perfectly, Major. I want to see you. - I've been expecting you. Sit down, my dear. Don't excite yourself. I'm going with that wagon train, Henry. A man would happen to think you prefer the company of savage Indians to mine. You said I could go on the first escorted train. I took that to be a promise. Right. I did promise I suppose. But the risks and perils are too great. You are my ward, my responsibility. You are my dead brother's wife. And I owe a debt to him to see that his widow is returned safely to her family. I'd never forgive myself if I didn't. Surely you can understand that? But if I'm quite willing to take the risk myself? But you can't. I can't let you. I think of Richard and I put myself in his place. I'd put myself in his place and think what he would want for you. He'd want you to stay here with me where you could have my care and protection. And if I don't want your care and protection? You were happy when you first came here. You told me so. What happened to the good feeling we used to have .. When I could watch you moving about our quarters. Doing the small womanly tasks you might have done if Richard were alive? Which could make me imagine he still was. You'd better tighten that lashing, Mr Dibble. Yes, sir. All squared up, Reverend? - I'm sure we are, Captain. Watch out for Indians. They may be your brothers as you say, but .. And on to your scalp. - I'll do that, Captain. A new order. Go to your post. Yes, sir. You committed your orders to memory? - I have, sir. Everything checked and accounted for, sir. Well then, there is nothing ore to be said is there, except .. A safe journey. Thank you, sir. - Oh, Clay. Good luck. Thanks. I may need it. Goodbye, Brad. By twos .. by the right flank .. Ho! That's all, gentlemen. Thank you, Henry. Thank me? For what? For giving my Rebs this mission. For trusting them. Oh, I do trust them. I trust them to vamoose right into Texas the minute they smell rebel ground. What on earth are you thinking? Well, I hope I'm thinking with the brain of a soldier. That seems to require a bit of explanation to you. Alright, I don't mind giving you a lesson. You see, if ever I'm in a real pinch around here I'd like to be sure that .. All of the enemy is in front of my guns. Not some of it in my ranks. So if they are going to desert, let them desert now. At least I won't be any worse off than I was before they came here. Does that satisfy you? No it doesn't. Hang it, you've let civilians go with them. Don't need to worry about the civilians. They'll deliver them before the scoot. They are not necessarily savages. It's because they're traitors. Besides, there is not a civilian in that train .. Whom I didn't advice personally that he was going at his own risk. Colonel, sir. I think you want to go back there. - What's the matter? Mrs Kenniston. In the Parson's wagon. Sergeant Pickens just found her. Halt! I was nervous we'd get into trouble. Well, Mrs Kenniston. You can't send me back. I won't go. - Where do you think you're going? May I have a word with you, sir? - Better have a very good one, Reverend. This young woman has a family waiting for her in California. She appealed to my wife and me for help. From a situation which I can assure you .. Only after much prayer that we decided it was our Christian duty to help her. Don't send her back, Lieutenant. Who said anything about sending her back? Well .. I am very grateful, Lieutenant. I've always heard that southerners were gentlemen. Have you, ma'am? Among the Spanish people, it's a quality we value. Don't you hear that, gentlemen? It must be mighty jolting riding in that wagon, a horse woman like you. Gentlemen. Take me mount, Mrs Kenniston. I can double up with Hank. Oh no, I wouldn't think of it. - But I'd consider it a privilege. It's been a spell since any of us have had a chance to serve a lady. I'd count it as an honor to my own sweetheart back home. She's a rare beauty like yourself, ma'am. Well .. if you put it that way. That's very generous of you, Lieutenant. No skin off my nose if she cares to ride along with us as far as were going. Well, I certainly hadn't expected anything like this. You put us on our mettle, ma'am. Gentlemen. Escort the lady to the front. Here comes the Major running like a turkey. Who is the officer of the day? - Captain Bradford, sir. Order out a detachment on the double. Elena missing. Have my horse brought up too. - You'd never catch them, Henry. They're in a forced march and have 12 hours start. Don't argue. Do as I say. How many men will you want? - How many? Well, a small detail might be taken by the Indians. If not, those Rebs will put up a fight. If they're deserting as you seem to think. Shall I order out the garrison and leave The Post undefended? Are you trying to make it look impossible? It is impossible, isn't it? What are you staring at? I'm just taking a look at you, Henry. You might as well know that I knew she'd gone. You say. I saw her in the Simpkins' wagon and I let her go. Why you .. - I think she had every right. Captain Bradford, confine yourself to quarters until further notice. Mind if I ride along? I'll give the man back his horse. The outfit is making good ground, sir. My orders were not to lose time. We'll rest through part of the day. At Rock Springs? You seem acquainted with this country. I know Texas better. But I know this ground too. Hey, Sarge. - Yeah? Them hills over there. St Andrews mountains, ain't they? Yeah, and you know what's behind that? Texas. Stretching beyond the whole blooming homeland. Well, we'll all be home soon enough. Get in tomorrow. "Tomorrow". Say, that sure does have a pretty sound. [ Singing ] "I'm a good old rebel, and that's just what I am." "And for this land of freedom I do not give a hang." "I hate their glorious banners and all their flags and fuss." "Them lying, thieving Yankees, I hate 'em worse and worse." "I fought with old Bob Lee." "For three years there about." "I was wounded in four places and starved at Point Lookout." Men get homesick sometimes. I can understand that. We got a long way to go. What's it like out there? - In Monterey? - Hmm. Oh, it's only a small place. My family has a vineyard. Just a sleepy, peaceful place. You know, just family. A mission church. Quiet. The bells on Sundays. Sounds to me as if you may as well become a nun. I don't mean that irreligious. I mean .. well .. The way you strike me. A little girl left her peaceful home, the bosom of her family. Went out into the big cruel world, got her fingers burned. Now wants to run and hide. - Lieutenant Tucker. That's what it about comes to, doesn't it? Do you always have to laugh at me? There wouldn't be any point in my .. Getting serious about you, would there? No. There would not. Obvious. North pole and south. What was your name before it was Kenniston? Miss "Elena Maria Gabriella Mercedes Del Mari del Muele." That's .. that's a pretty fancy name. I believe I like it better than "Kenniston". What is it, Cy? - Some of the horses about done in, sir. Some of the men are too. Well .. we'll camp by the river. Tell them it's the end of the trail. That will perk them up, won't it. - It sure will, Colonel. You should be asleep if you're starting out for California at the bust of dawn. Mrs Simpkins has a fever. I'm going after water. - Allow me. I can take care of myself thank you. Now Miss Elena Maria Gabriella .. I forget the rest of it, ma'am. A lady should never tell a man she can take care of herself. He is .. Apt to take her at her word. You are not taking your men back to The Post. It's in the air. A person can't miss it. I can tell by the way you are so happy. Where do you think I am taking the men? What do you intend to do? Get back in the fight again? I can't conceal I would enjoy it, if it were possible. You're as bad as the Major. Full of nothing but hate. Why do you men like to fight? For hatred? For killing? No, ma'am. The war is most particular to me. Why? I've got a place near Atlanta. Oh. Is it nice? I don't know now Sherman has got it. Was it nice before? I doubt if you'd like that country. It's .. Real fierce land. Red. Blood red when it rains. But a man gets fond of it. Hey! Lieutenant, sir. These here fellows say they are looking for Mr Ephraim Strong. What do you want with Strong? Lieutenant Tucker. Walk off a little piece here, Lieutenant. Hadn't you better take somebody with you, sir? Keep those men here. These men are friends of mine. Ranchers up from Mexico. But Americans. - That's fishy enough. Riding through Indian country by themselves. They are southerners. All the way up from Mexico? Your outfit came through too. That's fishy in the same way. - What are you up to, Strong? The same thing you are, Colonel Tucker. Only I'm going about it as part of a big plan. Not just shooting off wild the way you are. What would it come to, your running off to Texas? For a short-legged man, you jump to long conclusions. What would you do? Work your way back to Georgia and throw your men in front of Sherman's army? I can show you a way that each of your men would count for ten. Maybe more. I'm a Confederate agent, Tucker. Is that what you say you are? By the way, your mother and sister are alright. They are in Richmond. What's on your mind? Look here. Here is Texas .. New Mexico. Arizona. California. We are going to link Confederate Texas with the Pacific Ocean. In California there are tens of thousands .. Of southern sympathisers waiting to come across the border. We'll meet them with supplies. There'll be wagon trains meeting along the line. We'll draw a defence line straight across the nation. You mean what General Sibley had in mind three year ago? Yes .. it's got to come true. Our nation is dying, Colonel. I've been North. I've seen what they're killing us with. Shoe factories, gun factories. You don't have to tell me what they've got in the North. We're being suffocated by the Yankee blockade. But if we can get the gold fields in California, the sea ports on the Pacific. You said my men would count ten to one. What can they do? First. Go back to Fort Thorn. Go back now? You'll tip off everything if you desert now. Go on back. Be patient. Keep your eye on the fort. It's the only block between Texas and Tucson. Get the confidence of the Major as I did. He's got me pegged as working for the War Department in Washington. He's got you pegged as a Reb who's on his way to desert. He's a smart soldier. Don't you see? You'll have him in your hand if you go back now. Wait until I give you the word then meet one of our supply trains and join up. There is a big day coming if you work this carefully. Will your men follow you back? When will the word come? They're impatient. They can practically see Texas from here. I'm just as impatient as you are. It could be months. It could be next week. Will you do it? Yes. Colonel. There's a thing that bothers me. That girl coming along. The Major sets a store by her. He'll never forgive you. - I didn't get her out. I'm not talking about getting her out. I'm talking about taking her back. That is, if you think it is important .. Having the Major trust you. In the morning, when you turn the wagons over to the unit from Fort .. Roll the wagons! Roll 'em! I just want to thank you once again, Lieutenant. Don't mention it. Sergeant Pickens. I don't know exactly why I should wish you good fortune, but I do. Goodbye. - Sergeant. Take Mrs Kenniston into custody. Yes, sir. - Put her on a horse. Tie her on if necessary. She's coming back with us. Oh no, let me go! And in view of the wholesale desertion of these rebels. I again call to the attention of the Chief of Staff .. A lack of wisdom. In freeing these traitors. Only to place army posts like this in jeopardy. Paragraph. Tucker will be back. I may be stubborn. You're not only stubborn, Captain. You're also asinine. He is 24 hours overdue. I have continuously requested being relieved of this command. Being assigned to a post .. Where I could be of help. In winning the war of the rebellion. Yes? Can't it wait, Duffy? I beg your pardon, sir. Lieutenant Tucker is here. The orders have been carried out, sir. Civilians delivered. Anything wrong, sir? Let me have my moment of surprise. Absolutely no incidents on the road, sir. Took it easy coming back. The mounts were fast. What have you done with Mrs Kenniston? There is a strange story, sir. We'd been out six hours when she was discovered .. I know she was in the Simpkins' wagon, Lieutenant. Her name wasn't listed, so .. If you allowed Mrs Kenniston without my permission to .. No, sir. You will find her in your quarters, sir. You brought her back? I hope I didn't do wrong. Thank you. Sorry to say, sir. It did take a little force. He had you going for the hills. Yeah, I guess we all did. Elena. Why did you do this? Why did you disobey me? You know the responsibility I felt for your safety. Am I to believe you had to be dragged back here? You had so little regard for my feelings or for principle or for memories? Are you completely blind to yourself, Henry? Of course, you intend to explain what you mean. Why do you lie to yourself? Don't you really know yourself? With all your worship of your brother and .. Talk of obligation and putting yourself in his place. Don't you know why you want me here? You don't dare think a thing like that. If you were open and honest it would be less horrible. You make me feel unclean. I notice the lock on my door is out of order. Kindly send one of your men to repair it. Things are going on round this territory that are suspicious and mysterious. You keep bringing in these reports of wagon tracks. Three times in the past week. Wagon tracks! But nobody ever sees any wagons. Am I to assume that each and all of you have lost your eyesight? I submit as a simple assumption gentlemen that .. Wagon tracks are made by wagons. Well, where are they? Where do they come from? Where are they going? And what in blazes are they doing around here? I intend to get to the bottom of this. I want two large patrols out today. Captain Bradford. - Yes, sir. I want your troop on this. I want you take half the men yourself and patrol in a semicircle to the south. Ten miles. As far as Red Rocks. - Yes, sir. I want the other half of the men out to the north under .. Lieutenant Reynolds. Platoon, by the right flank, ho! Halt! Major Kenniston. I've really got something for you, sir. The scout's word is that he is Satank's own son. I have any ears. I know the beggar. - I tried to question him, sir. What would the son of a chieftain have to say to a Second Lieutenant, Mr Adams? Bring him inside. I'll deal with the rebel. Tucker, what are you doing here? Major's compliments, Lieutenant. He wants you back at The Post right away. He wants me? He thinks they've brought in Satank's son. He wants you in to identify him. Stanley is there. You'd better get moving hadn't you, Al? Yeah. I guess I'd better. Well, that breaks half of us free. Darned if you ain't a mighty slick deceiver, Colonel. Now Cy, that wasn't all lies. That part about Satank's son was true. At a gallop, follow me! It's Satank. Satank! [ Indian language ] Well? Satank demand his son, Major. He demands? A rebel demands? In the interest of discretion, sir .. - I said "rebel" and I mean a rebel. Just as much as if the Confederate Army .. Had given him a uniform to go with his paint and feathers. He demands? Tell him I'm not here to accept insults to the Army of the United States. Tell him I will demand and he'll accept. Tell him that before I .. No. Tell him he'll have his son at once. [ Indian language ] [ Gunshot! ] [ Indian language ] That's my answer from the United States Government to rebels and traitors! Troop .. halt! Clay, what are you doing out here? Did the Major change his orders? I reckon I changed his orders for him. That's right Sergeant, take it. What the ..? - Sorry, sir. Sorry it had to be you, Brad. Clay, what's this all about? Now we'll go find those wagons the Major was so curious about. Halt! Sergeant. Take Captain Bradford back now. Better have Lem with you. Take him to within sight of the fort and turn him loose. Give him his pistol then. You should be able get there and back by tonight. Easy, Colonel. To explain everything would take a long time, Brad. Why, I wouldn't think of delaying you, Colonel. Think you could find your way to our camp? Ought to, sir. You give me a map. - Then don't sit there. Sorry, sir. Do you mind, Captain? Pickens and Lem, ain't it? Three of 'em. They're bringing him back. The Post is under siege, sir. - Satank? - Yes, sir. He's got it surrounded. How many would you say? - I judge about 12 or 15 hundred. But they ain't attacked yet. - They never do at night. Better go down and get some food. Why not say what you're thinking? Cy, we've got to go back. Tell me they are American. Say there are women and children there. Tell me if the fort is wiped out it will be because of .. A troop of southern cavalry deserted its post. As a matter of fact Clay, I was thinking of your home in the south. Even though her battle is almost lost. I know how much you'd like to help her. Sergeant. - Yes, sir? Wake the men. Yes, sir. I doubt if many of them are sleeping. Alright men! Wake up. The Colonel wants to talk to you. Gather round. I've always taken it on my own to tell you what to do. I won't do that anymore. I owe it to you to tell you that .. I'm going back to The Post. I'm not glad to be going. I don't even know if I'm right. Those of you who want to come along will come. I won't guarantee that you're doing right. I must warn you that .. Many of us may be killed. The rest of you go on. No hard feelings. I hope that some of us may gave good luck. You're a crazy southerner, Clay. You know, I'll be grateful if you'll be quiet. You can make up an excuse so we can go, can't you? Well, we've followed him this far. How are we going to stop now? Jehoshaphat. I guess the first thing to do is to try and get inside. Well as old lion pants Jeb Stuart used to say .. The fastest way is the quickest. What are we waiting for. Dismount! Water buckets filled in all buildings. List the women and children. Yes, sir. Sir? - Split your troop in two. Take half to the front gate and stockade yourselves. As I was saying, sir. We were unavoidable cut off. Lieutenant Tucker in charge of the south stockade. - Yes, sir. They're coming from the rear, sir. Well, if it ain't Johnny Come Lately. We got plenty of time to get killed, ain't we. Elena. Mark! Dr Magowan! You started to say something. Yes, Mark. Dr Magowan! You sure pick the times. I fell in love with you at your wedding. I had to pick a time like this to tell you. Just keep quiet, dear. I'll get the doctor. Don't worry. They'll go away when the sun goes down. They'll go away. That's about all I can think of for the present, gentlemen. Carry on your assignments. Patch up as best you can. In a way, I don't suppose it matters. I know what we're in for tomorrow. Keep it from the women if you can. That's all. Goodnight. Goodnight, sir. And Duffy. - Yes, sir? Stay here with me will you. Lieutenant, may I give you a cup of coffee? Thank you. Would you like some coffee? Thank you. Lieutenant. Will you make that girl get some rest before she drops in her tracks. How are you making out? It's worth being wounded to have her tend to it. I feel alright, really. You heard the doctor. That's an order. Come on. - Aright. Just for an hour or two then. I owe you a very great apology. Why? Having dragged you back here. Of course, it's a fine time to tell you. - Don't say that. What? "This is a fine time to tell you." Brad said that. Just before he died. He was in love with you. He said that too. As for bringing me back, I expect in your place I'd have done the same. That's very generous of you to say so. This was on the arrow. There's something written on it, sir. Find that scout. He can read that mumbo-jumbo. You'd better get the other officers too. Yes, sir. Pickens! Pickens! Is tomorrow to be the end of the world? Major Kenniston's compliments, sir. He wants you at once. Get that sleep. That's the long and short of it, Major. You killed his son, and .. In revenge, he demands the lives of the officers involved. He said he will spare the others if he gets the officers. My officers? - You can't take Satank's word, sir. You know, he .. He doesn't really want all of you. What was your name again? First Sergeant Joseph Alhambra Pickens, sir. Have the main gate open for me in five minutes. You don't intend to go by yourself do you, sir? I killed his son. Satank knows it. Don't you think I'm an ample pound of flesh for one scrawny savage? The gate, Sergeant. - Yes, sir. You can't do this, sir. Duffy, if ever you're in command of a post like this .. You'll find you do just as you please. Take a lesson from Lieutenant Tucker here. You don't hear him protesting. Frankly sir, I'm speechless. I hadn't calculated you had it in you. History records a number of officers born north of the Mason-Dixon line, Lieutenant. By the way. An ironic twist of fate my having to turn command of this post over to you. You don't have to, sir. There is Lieutenants Reynolds and Adams. See that you take good care of my Post. Yes, sir. What's left of it. There won't be any need for you to keep your door locked any longer. You were right of course. There is nothing I wouldn't have done to keep you with me. Goodbye, Elena. [ Man screams! Very loud! ] Lieutenant Reynolds. - Yes, sir. Get a detail. Go and bring in the Major's body. - Yes, sir. Lieutenant Reynolds. Is there any news? I wouldn't go out there, Mrs Kenniston. [ Bugle call! ] Courier for Major Kenniston, sir. Major Kenniston has been killed in the line of duty. Lieutenant Tucker is temporarily in command. Despatches, sir. You are not in good shape. Sergeant Duffy will make you as comfortable as possible. Looks like you really had a bad one. What's the news from outside, sir? "Shortly before Christmas day." "General Sherman completed his march to the sea." "The city of Savannah, Georgia has surrendered." The war is about done, folks. The Confederacy is cut clean in half! [ Singing: ] "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord." "He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored." "He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword." "His truth is marching on." "Glory, glory hallelujah." "Glory, glory hallelujah." "Glory, glory hallelujah." "His truth his marching on." "Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton, old times there are not forgotten." "Look way, look away, look away, Dixie Land." "In Dixie Land where I was born in, early on a frosty mornin'." "Look away, look away, look away .." Cy, of all people. I imagine he'd like to tell me that I brought him a long way to .. Die for the Yankees. I don't think he did that. I don't think that any of them died for the North or for the South. Well, it doesn't matter to them now. Was it true what the courier said, that the war will soon be over? Yes. Doesn't the end of war have to be a beginning? What will you do then, go home? To what? Who is trying to run and hide now? I'm sorry. It was an unk?nd thing to say. I know how you must feel. - It's alright, ma'am. Look at them. Already, they're starting to rebuild. One battle and there is much to be done. You are the Commandant of this Post now. May I ask you a favor? - You certainly may. When you finish with all you have to with the military .. Could you spare me few workers? My home is a shambles. Just look at it. Yes. I'll send you Sergeant Pickens. - Thank you. He used to be ? mason. Todo ser? mejor ma?ana. What does that mean? That means: it will all seem better tomorrow. T-G ??
