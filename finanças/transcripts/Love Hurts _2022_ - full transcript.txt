[static scratching] [ominous music] [phone ringing] [camera flashing] - [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? - [Man] He won't answer. He won't pick up the phone for me. It's Valentine's Day, I just- - [Operator] Sir, try to calm down. Tell me what's going on. - [Man] I have to change. I have to change. I have to change. - Sir, are you still there? Are you okay? - [Man] I have to change. - [Man 2] What are you doing? There's no time for this. - [Man] Should I wear the black? No, no, he loves green, I'll wear the green. I'll wear the green, I'll wear the green, I'll wear the green, I'll wear the green. - [Man 2] We have to get downstairs. Stop this- - [Man] No, I must change. - [Man 2] Why, why must you change? - [Man] So that he'll love me again. We were a family. I lost him. - [Man 2] We have to get back. You haven't lost him yet. What are you smoking? - [Man] It's not crack, it's bass. - [operator] Sir, is everything okay? - [Man] I just want to live. - [Man 2] Hello? - [Operator] This is 911. Is there an emergency? - [Man 2] Yes, we're at the Lionsgate Estate in Beverly Hills. Please send someone. - [Operator] Is anyone hurt?

Too bad we just missed the performance. - Too bad? Like you had something better to do? - I mean I figured there were worse ways to spend a solo Valentine's Day than being paid to meet some attractive ladies. - Hmm, cheers to that. [breathing heavily] [ominous music] [captive breathing heavily] [mysterious music] [breathing heavily] - No, no, no, no, no, no. [ominous piano music] [singer mumbling] [ominous piano music] It's okay. It's okay. [ominous piano music] - Calvin, I take it you guys got the 10K offer as well, right? - Eric, yeah, why else would I respond to this circus invitation? Although I wouldn't be upset if you two were making more than us. Two beautiful bodies are worth a fortune. Nice to meet you. - Eva, I'm Eva. - And I'm Cindy. Word of advice, maybe next time try not to objectify a woman within the first five minutes of knowing her. [group laughs] God. What about you handsome, you know how to treat a lady? - My mother raised me right. - You look kind of familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? - No, no, I don't think so. I'm sure I would recognize a girl like you. - I'm Jason. Glad to see you we're all a normal looking group of people. No obvious serial killers. You never know with these social experiments. - What exactly does a serial killer look like, Jason? - Oh, I just meant, I was just making a joke. - He knows what you meant. - I'm Jeff and I just got out of a pretty bad relationship. I figured a free dinner and some entertainment are good enough reasons for me to leave the house. Oh, and I'm vegan. - Why does everyone who's vegan have to tell you they're vegan within the first five minutes of meeting 'em, right? - I was vegan for two days, but I like meat too much. - I do too. - Oh, well it looks like Edward and Bella are sorted out so if we could just break through the whole vegan culture here. - Speaking of breakthrough, did you guys read the invite? What sorts of like breakthroughs are we making, like swapping childhood traumas? - I was hoping for a little more romance and less head shrinking. - Well, I do remember a line on the invite. I guess I figured it was just matchmaker talk, like which astrological signs are the most compatible and which have the best sex, bullshit like that. - That last line doesn't sound like bullshit to me. Pisces, right? - Sure am. - Yummy. - Whatever it means, I think this evening calls for a group selfie. Who's in? - Here, I can take it. - Hell yeah. You'll send it to me or maybe I should take it, evidence in case I get kidnapped. - Nah, I got it, it's cool. - You're doing it wrong. Let me take it. Okay. Smile. [camera flashing] Cute. - Huh, that's awesome. It'll be a great story one day. I do wonder though. - What? - What kind of person pays a group of strangers $10,000 just to come to dinner? - Perhaps a lonely one. - Oh, Alfred's back. - Though I care not to speculate at my host's expense. - I didn't mean any offense. - None taken. Ladies and gentlemen, follow me. - Good job. [mysterious music] - Ooh, ooh, I see champagne. - What can we do for you, Alfred? - Ladies and gentlemen, your host has asked that I obtained the signatures on these waivers here in front of you. Just a simple formality, I'm sure you understand. And then Miss Cindy, I'll fetch that champagne. - Wait, waivers? - Yeah, I'm not sure I follow. - Basic contract so we can get paid. Sound about right, Alfred? - Yeah, we shouldn't sign anything without reading it. - Dude, it's about the money. - Master Eric is of course correct, although you're more than welcome to read the waiver in front of you. But it is simply to allow remittance of your compensation agreements immediately upon completion. - Of what? - Of the evening, Master Jeff. - What do we have to do? - Simply be yourselves. That's all your gracious host requires. - Shit, as long as we get paid, right? - You can say that again. I am drowning in grad school debt. - Splendid. And as per the master's wishes, we will be indulging in a technology free evening. I'm sure you understand. Your smartphones if you please. - I'm not really sure- - Old school rule, no devices at the table, my mother would be proud. - Kind of refreshing. I mean, who wants to try to get to know someone who's staring at their phone, right? Besides it's just dinner. - Exactly and then we walk out of here $10,000 richer. - Yeah, I mean what's the worst that can happen? Besides my evening feels lucky already. - I mean, I don't normally give up my phone. I'm somewhat of an influencer, so- - Your parents must be very proud, Miss Cindy. - Thank you. - Champagne. - Are you following me? - Am I following you? - On Instagram? - Oh, no, no, I don't follow you on Instagram, but I guess as soon as we get our phones back I could. - [Eric] Is an influencer even a real job? Like is how you pay your rent? - Well, I do a little bit of everything. I do like, modeling and acting. - Okay, so why don't you just tell people you're a server? - What do you do for a living, Eric? - I'm a motivational speaker. - Wait, you're a motivational speaker? - Yeah, I could probably make everyone's lives better here in like five minutes. You're all doing something wrong. - Like what? - [Eric] Well for starters, you responded to this circus invitation. - As did you. - Are you gonna be an ass the entire night or just the first hour? - Hm, you know I figured everyone living around here was in tech or acting. - I'm getting my master's in bioengineering so that's not quite tech. - So can you please tell us why there's no surveillance footage from last night? Surely, a man as grand as the one you're working needs constant protection. - It is a beautiful home, isn't it, miss... - My name isn't important, but what's important is you answer my questions. Look just because your boss is rich doesn't mean he's above the law. - Did you say your name wasn't important? - That's right. - Well here I was thinking nobody was above the law. - What? - It's my rudimentary understanding of this country's laws that when being interrogated by police officers such as yourself, you have a right to ask for their name and their badge number. Is that not correct or is it you that thinks you're above the law? - 2840. That's her badge number. - Its Agent Denver. - Agent Denver, 2840. - [Agent Denver] Mhm. - How can I help? - The CCTV recording from last night? - Yes, master's very clear on this, no recording of any kind during social engagements. - And why is that? - Well, he's a very powerful man. Dines with the highest members of society, I'm sure you understand. These men and women value their privacy. I'm sure you mean anonymity, right? - I couldn't say. - Actually your guests from last night were not from high society. As a matter of fact, they were a bunch of 20 somethings with pretty run off the mill jobs, right? - Yes, I mean nevertheless, the social engagement protocols are the same. We switch off the internal security cameras. Who am I to question my master's directive? - Okay, so let me, let me get this straight. You never question your master, even when four dead bodies show up? Did I state that correctly? - Yes, it was a tragedy, but how were we supposed to know what would've happened? - [Eric] What about you Eva? - I work for the state, social services. - Ah, I can't imagine what you see day in and day out. - It's not always pretty, but I get to be part of the solution so that some bad things be fixed. - Well, if you're looking for a broken boy, you don't have to look much further. - [Cindy] Isn't that like depressing? - I think it's heroic. I mean if you're not gonna do something for money, you might as well do something that people respect, right? But even I don't have this kind of money. - Should I be checking these for like drugs? - Don't worry, girl, I'll watch your drink for you. - Did you just call me girl? Don't start sounding like a motivational speaker over there. - Lady, woman? - Cindy works. - Why don't we toast to Valentine's Day and social experiments? - Um, the performer, will they be joining us? Where'd they go? - Just to change, Miss Eva, just to change. Now if everybody would like to accompany me, please make your way up to the dining room. Our host is very eager for the breakthroughs to begin. I'll take your glasses. Miss Eva. Master Eric. Master Jeff. Master Jason. Miss Cindy. Mr. Calvin. [ominous music] - Well if nothing else, the champagne's good. - Yeah, it's decent. - And the help's even better. - I could certainly get used to this. - This is a beautiful house. - Here's to this beautiful house full of beautiful people. - [Host] I'll drink to that. - Ladies and gentlemen, would you please stand? Your host has arrived. - Oh, no need for ceremony with me, darlings, please sit. - We thought you were entertainment, no offense. - No dear, that'd be you, no offense. Welcome. Hello. It's so nice to have you gorgeous people with me tonight. Eva, dear, you look stunning. And look at that figure, so nice. It's a shame you cover it up so much, mind. Don't be bashful around me. - Thank you. - Don't be embarrassed. - Cindy, look at you dear. Look at you putting your best stiletto forward. May I borrow them sometime? - I mean, considering how much you're paying us to be here, you can have them. - Dear. - I agree with Cindy, that 10K was a great fucking lure. - Oh, what about love? Eva, surely you must value love over any amount of money? - Oh, well it's like a primal need, right? Maslow and all. - Yes, primal indeed. And Jeff, didn't you come here for love? - Well, I figured I can't do any worse here than the local gay bars and free drinks. - Yes, free drinks, of course. [ominous music] Welcome. [ominous music] Be a dear. - Of course. [ominous music] - Each one of you has been invited here tonight for this special evening, specifically, you were chosen, and each one of you will experience your own personal breakthrough tonight within the next few hours. There is love in the air. You just have to be open to it. - Thank you for having us, sir. - Thanks, I'm really enjoying this view. - That's meat, right? - Is this? - Of course, it's vegan dear. We wouldn't want to upset your little system. - No offense Jeff, but I don't give a damn about your vegan lifestyle or whatever. What I do care about is making sure we get what we were promised here tonight. - Yes, $10,000. - Yes, Master Eric, we must remind you that you need to complete your whole evening in order to receive your remittance. - Damn, this is hot. Are you trying to kill me? - Please be careful, please, I wouldn't want you to get burned on my watch. - Um, so the whole evening, how many courses are we talking? - It's not a question of time, Miss Cindy. You must complete your personal breakthrough and then you'll get everything you deserve. - Okay. - Yes, Cindy, it's true. You must stay and receive your own personal breakthrough. All of us, we must all stay and receive our breakthroughs. - Well, I pay $100 an hour to a therapist once a week and I haven't had any breakthroughs, but hey, if you're paying me. - And we're here already, we might as well enjoy ourselves. - Yeah, we only live once. - I might as well have some carbs then. Can I? [dramatic music] - Of course, dear, to your heart's content. [mysterious music] - [Agent Denver] Are you afraid of your employer? Have you ever seen him do anything worrisome? - Good heavens. No Agent Denver, I'm not afraid. What a ridiculous question. - She never questioned it, but you're not afraid, right? So what about the other guests, anybody there you were afraid of? - Perhaps I've not been clear. - How about this? How about this? Did your master use illegal substances when he entertained often? - I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. - Hmm. Friends in high places aren't gonna be able to protect you. - We'll see. [dramatic music] - We certainly will see, won't we? [ominous music] - And last but not least, a salad for Master Jeff. - There seems to be a pink and red theme with the food tonight. - You noticed. It is Valentine's Day after all. - Excuse me, I think mine is a little undercooked. - Oh dear. - Speak for yourself. Meat is supposed to be raw. - I can assure you, Miss Cindy, it's all sustainably sourced, perfectly fresh and very safe. Absolutely delicious. - I wish I had my phone so I could take a picture of it. - Miss Eva, would you prefer something else? - Oh no, this is fine. - Master Jason? - Well I think if they can handle it, I can too. - Oh dear Jason, you never know what you might be able to handle. Just like tonight, you try it, you might just like it. [dramatic music] - I mean, I'd try an awful lot for $10,000. - You're so sweet, dear, I'm counting on it. Thank you. - I bet you'd try a lot for 10 bucks. - Hey, that's rude. Apologize, now! - Come on. - Apologize! [host giggling] - Master Eric, we will have a civilized dinner. - I'm sorry. The mind just gravitates towards dark humor. - Oh, it's okay. The brain is a complicated instrument after all. - Is there a problem, Jason? Can I help you with something? - No, I just don't feel the need to ask a host to make a completely different meal for my fleeting diet. - Oh boys, so much testosterone in the room. Would you be a dear and fetch my kitty? - [Butler] Of course. - Oh, I love cats. - You're so cute. - [Butler] Your kitty, sir. [host sniffing] - Angel wings. Ketamine, anyone? - I guess it's that type of party. - You're no fun. The brain is a complicated instrument, but it can be predicted and even manipulated. - Manipulated? - Oh, in only the best kinds of way, dear Eva. I bet your brain is already telling you that the person capable of fulfilling those deepest fantasies of yours may be already in this room. [dramatic music] That person that could maybe rescue you for a change, even though you've only just met. - Come on, bro, she deals with crazy all day. - Are you saying you don't believe in love at first sight? - Are you saying you believe in love at for sight, Calvin? - I don't know, but I don't want to count it out just yet. - Oh dear, I think this might just be lust speaking. She is what the kids would call a fine piece of ass. - Hey. - Oh, come on. - I mean, I am. - She is. - I imagine it's rare, love at first sight. Maybe people sometimes throw away all common sense in pursuit of some forever love but it doesn't mean it's impossible or crazy. - You don't believe love is crazy? [Jeff clears throat] - Sir, I mean, wait, what do we call you? - I don't think I'd mind it if you called me sir. - Okay sir, have you ever been in love before or married? [mysterious music] - I was once. They're not here anymore. - The host isn't here to answer your questions. This evening is about everybody else. [mysterious music] Sir, they're not here right now, but we have six wonderful guests. - Okay. Okay. Six wonderful guests. - Sir, perhaps they'd like a demonstration, sir. - To demonstrate what? - Please. [mysterious music] - The insanity of love of course. Now which one of you is brave enough to go first? [mysterious music] - Go first? For what? - Oh dear. [ominous music] - So these guests, they were supposed to perform party tricks for you, is that it? That's what you were paying them for? - Do not answer the question. - I prefer not to answer that question. - So was it sexual entertainment, hmm? I mean, we did find an undergarment in the dining room. - My client will not be answering that question. - Her client will not be answering that question. - And how did you pick these six individuals? I mean there must have been something specific about each one of them, right? - My client will not be answering that question. - I prefer not to answer that question. - Are there any God damn questions that your client will be answering today? - Okay, hey, hey, how 'bout we just do an easy one? - An easy one. - Why'd you invite 'em? - Now this one's worth answering, yes? Have you ever been in love, detective, not lust, but true love, the kind you'd give your life's last breath just to be next to them? - Have you ever? - See, lust is a very powerful thing, but it's fleeting. My guests all needed someone to love, someone to belong to in a real way. So desperate were each of them for a breakthrough that they RSVP'd for a circus show, and my detectives, what a show it was. - You were the ringleader, right? - Ring leader, I think that would be giving away too much information, yeah? So her client refuses to answer that question. - Lion tamer? - Lion tamer? No daddy, perhaps maybe I'm just the lion. [ominous music] - Sir, perhaps I could prepare you a little something from the kitchen that you might like? - No. - Sir, you do need to eat something in order to do- - Fine. Hmm? Happy? - Fuck it, I'll go first. - I knew you would, dear. Think of me as your own personal cupid. I can give you anything you like. You just have to tell me what that is. - To get laid and get paid. It doesn't have to be in that order. - Damn straight. - Of course, who wouldn't expect such a response from a red blooded boy such as yourself? [dramatic music] [mysterious music] Let the party begin. Oh lovely. Hi dear. This is my friend. The room as well as she is free for you to do with whatever you'd like. - If I wanted to pay for sex, I would've done it a lot closer to home. - Pay for sex, please, you're my guest. You're the one being paid, remember? She's completely free for you. - I mean, I don't know anything about this chick. How do I know if she's, you know clean? - So many excuses after all of the bravado earlier. What, she not attractive enough for you? Do you need to see just a teensie weensie bit more? Love, please be a dear, take off your clothes. - This is turning into some "Eyes Wide Shut" shit. - This is getting a little weird. - Now could you possibly find anything to object about this body? - This is messed up. I'm not fucking a hooker in front of a room full of strangers. - Oh sir, there's a room upstairs being made available for you if you'll just follow me. - No, see this is what I'm talking about. Predictable, your heart. Here it is, it's Valentine's Day, Eric, you're single and yet you won't bite. - I don't need this, bro, I'm out. - Master Eric, you're free to leave at any time, but I must remind you if you do leave before your breakthrough, you forfeit your compensation. - Might be kind of hard on a mechanic's salary. - Mechanic? - Oh, did I say too much, dear? He was probably trying to impress you. Wait, perhaps we can come to some kind of agreement, a compromise of sorts. - What kind of compromise? What kind of compromise? - Simple, you can leave with your cash, you just have to do one little thing for me, please. - And what's that? - Strip, just down your boxers. It's more than that poor dear had on. - I don't know what that'll prove. - Oh, come on. And here I was thinking I was doing you a favor, Eric. Eric. Don't worry, we won't see any more than if we were just frolicking on a beach together. It would be just like wearing a bathing suit. - No, I'm not stripping in front of a room full of people. - Why not? - Because it's fucking weird. - There's nothing more I can do for you. Show him the door. [ominous music] - Right here, huh? What just there! Is this what you wanted? Take a good look, you sick fuck. You obviously knew, right? Is this why you chose me? [host giggling] - There's no need to degrade him. Hey. It's okay. It's okay to feel, this isn't your fault. - Do you see? Do you? Days of chatting, hours wasted on Tinder, weeks of meaningless dates, and see these two, they would've never found the connection that I just gave to them. - I'm sorry for being a jerk tonight, I'm sorry. - It's okay, I've been there. - Maybe you would've found this connection all on your own after all. Perhaps when you walked in here, dear Eric, you already knew Eva was going to be your future, lovely. - You really expect us to believe that your master is some sort of matchmaker? - No, you fool, he was trying to teach the boy something. - Teach him what? It's what's inside that counts? That age old beauty and the beast bull. Give me a break. - He taught the boy confidence. - Oh. - And he did that by stripping him down both mentally and physically. Once that boy removed his shirt, he had no longer a need to hide behind that disgusting male bravado he was demonstrating. - So that charade was supposed to teach him confidence? Showing the whole room his childhood scars? Your master humiliated him. - Confidence is the ability to feel beautiful without needing to be told you are and I'm done talking about it. - What? Do you think it's strange? I just think it's basic psychology. - You and your basic psychology can go fuck yourself. - Oh, look at that breakthrough. Make sure to give him double the compensation. - Double his compensation, sir? - Did you not hear me? Make it happen, please. - It'll be done. - Oh Eva, don't be so upset, it's okay. Please sit. - Double just for taking his shirt off? I mean, I can top that. - Darling, don't worry. See, tomorrow Eric will wake up a richer and more confident man because you see, he realized tonight that there was just nothing to fear. There was just the little voice right here inside of his head. Please, don't be upset. - You know what, guys like that, really gets under their skin when you make 'em wait. They think their money and their fancy lawyers will let 'em get away with murder, right? Maybe it's time we taught him that that's not always the case, huh? - So what are we gonna do? - Wait. - Alright. - Master Eric, your car will be here momentarily. - Good. - Sir, if I might be so bold, your breakthrough just now, it was, well it was inspiring. Is everything all right, sir? Oh, of course, I beg your pardon. Master Eric, ah, your car, Master Eric. - You think she's worth all this? - Master Eric, if something is for you in life, it will not pass you. Godspeed, sir. [gentle music] [mysterious piano music] - Ugh, I wish I had my phone. I feel like, like naked without it. - Careful now, you don't want to give the host any ideas. - Yeah, this is way better than Tinder. - Well, there's certainly less weird ways of meeting someone and I'm not minding the company so much tonight. - Please eat. Eat my lovelies. [gentle piano music] Bon appetit. [dramatic music] - My, what a show this will be. - No, no, don't look at me like that. I'm not stripping down and I don't have any interesting scars. Do Calvin next, he seems eager. - Oh dear, I don't have that kind of plan for you. What our dear Eric needed for his breakthrough was completely unique to him, as will yours be to you. - Well, I'm not really a breakthrough kind of guy. - Oh. I'm quite ordinary. - Ordinary. - Yeah, yeah, I know where you're going with this, but I mean you, you haven't really given as much of a choice. I don't think this is gonna work out so I don't know dramatically for us. I mean you've only given me one, you've only given us one option and I, I'm not really into black guys. - Oh. - What? No offense, it's just a preference. We all have preferences. - That's racist. - No, no, it's not racist, my sister is married to a black guy. - You know, having a black family member doesn't cure your racism, right? - Yeah and it certainly doesn't erase hundreds of years of conditioning from slavery and inequality and Jim Crow. - Okay, so we're all woke now, great. [host giggling] - The caucasity. Would any of the white people at the table care to know what Jeff thinks perhaps? - Yeah, it's racist as fuck. - You can't call me racist just because I have a preference, a type. - No, we can't call you racist because it's not a preference, it's a prejudice. You've already made up your mind about anyone with my skin color and how they're unattractive. A preference would be not liking my hairstyle or my taste in movies or me getting to know you this evening and realizing you're a fucking dick. But you made your mind up already at the outset that you don't like my skin color. Of the two of us, I'm better looking and I have a better body and judging by your tired Zara suit, I also have a bigger bank account. And judging by your fucked up attitude, I'm a better lay too. And while you sit there up on your high horse with your pink pussy and acting like your shit don't stink, know that it's me who's too good for you. So listen, snowflake, I don't want you. [group clapping] [host giggling] - Bravo. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you- - Your problem, Jason, is that you overthink, you overthink everything. I know all about your preferences, dear. If you'd follow me. [ominous music] Master Jeff, right up front there. Master Jason, right in the center, this show is for you. - Please. These are your exes, yes? They're certainly not unattractive. - So how did your master end up with so much private information about his guests? - As I'm sure you're aware, detective, there is very little that is sacred these days. All this so-called private information, it's very publicly available. All you have to do is spend more than a cursory minute on these young people's social media platforms. - Mm and did the guests know that you were on their socials? - I can assure you, detective, that everything we did was very legal. Are you forgetting that they signed waivers? - Hmm. - You know the problem is they post so much and on so many different platforms, it's really just a case of piecing together the information, like one would with a puzzle. - As you can see, I know all about your tastes dear and I think I also know why none of these relationships lasted. You see Jason's always looking down the road, never happy in the here and now. - How did you find them? - Not to mention they all look awfully pale. - That's not fair, I've definitely been with black men. - Fucked black men, you mean? And then you ran your sweet little ass back to your dorm room to confide in your cookie cutter gays about how naughty you were, didn't you? Did you feel powerful? Did they fawn over you as you told them how you did the one thing their mommies and daddies would never approve of? - You're all ganging up on me. - Dear, dear, dear. I know this must be so hard for you. Aren't you just the teeniest bit attracted to him? You both like to travel, I thought you'd have so much in common. Guess where his favorite place to go is? Thailand, just like you. Jeff even has a little place there on the beach, don't you? You even drink the same brand of whiskey for God's sake. - Wait, how'd you know that? - You should know Jason that Jeff has never cheated on a lover. It means you can trust him, dear. I know trust is hard for you. It's not surprising all things considered, dear. - I'll take you, for example, detective. Haven't you ever been tempted to cyber stalk an ex, find out what they're doing? It's not hard and everybody does it. - How exactly did you find out about the cheating? 'Cause we checked Jason's socials, there's nothing. - It was an interrogation much like this one. Oh, don't mistake my meaning, they were free to leave at any time, they weren't coerced. I can give you the names of Jason's ex-lovers right now. They'll tell you that they were more than happy to talk to us. Of course, they were being handsomely rewarded for their time. I have a question, is there anything illegal about conducting a voluntary 45 minute polygraph, especially if they've signed consent forms? - No, actually, nothing at all wrong with a voluntary test. It just depends on what you do with the information though, doesn't it? - Well the truth can never be used as a weapon, surely. - [Detective Denver] Hmm. - Well, I guess we'll find out, won't we? - But of course, this night was built as a little less conversation, a little more action. [mysterious music] So would you like to know, Jason, which one of these cheated on you? - What? - You see, I know that all of these relationships ended with accusations of cheating. - Well, how could you possibly know that? - But you see, you were wrong, at least two out of the three times. Isn't that sad? Two out of three of those relationships might have worked out if Jason didn't have an issue with trust. - That's not, I don't know how you can know anything about any of this. You weren't there. - No, I wasn't there, but would you like to know which one is the cheater? - But how? - Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets, but for you, I offered each one of your exes $5,000 to take a polygraph test, a lie detector. See, I rarely find people that aren't willing to spill their guts about their exes, especially to strangers. So, would you like to know which one of these three is a cheater? - It doesn't matter. - It's all that matters, dear. What if I offered to punish one of the exes on your behalf? Would it matter then? - What? - If you'd wish to know, I'll double your take home, right now, $20,000 just like I did for Eric. - But why? Why are you doing this? - This could be your clean slate, Jason, your tabula rasa. And after you've done this, you know that you were wrong twice and that the offending lover will be punished on your behalf. They'll never know it's you though. And then, I can work on the rest of you. [ominous music] - So it turns out you might not be as clever as you thought. You confiscated everybody's phone at the party, didn't you? - Yes. - Because you wanted everybody to have a screen free experience, be in the moment? - Yes, detective, we wanted them to focus on themselves and each other, not their phones. - [Detective] Right. - Well, we have records from all the phones at the party that night. And it turns out one of them was still being used after you collected them. - I'm afraid that's not possible unless it was Master Eric. Master Eric left early. - Nope, not Eric, uh huh. Yeah, you took their phones, but did it ever occur to you that many people have other devices that can send messages, for example, a watch? - Well, I didn't see any smart watches on our guests. - Well, it turns out one of the new ones, they look pretty much like normal watches and Jeff was a lover of gadgets. [ominous music] - Look, it's not worth it, all right, trying to find out what happened in the past. Don't worry about that. Who cares? Don't be controlled by money or revenge. - Jeff, I'm sorry, okay? - For what? - For earlier. I mean no one's ever called me out like that before and I, I deserved it, every bit of it. I hope you'll forgive me. Look maybe, I don't know, maybe I've been wrong about the kind of guys I'm attracted to. Do you want to get, do you want to get a drink after this? - I said I didn't want you, all right? - Seriously? - I'm just, I don't hate myself enough. - Well, all this back and forth is just exhausting, isn't it? Are you leaving or not, Jason? - Yes. - Sir, you're free to leave at any time, but of course, I must remind you that if you do so before your personal breakthrough, you forfeit any compensation. - I'd like to go. - Are you sure, sir? It's a lot of money. [mysterious music] - Which one? - You knew we would never work, Jason and I. What's my breakthrough or was I just collateral damage? - Who was it? - Master Jason, I'm terribly sorry, but from the moment you asked to leave, the host can no longer help you or answer any questions. You're done, sir. [mysterious music] - Ladies and gentlemen, I've taken the liberty of preparing a rather delicious charcuterie board. In the living room, if you care to follow me. And Miss Cindy, I have more champagne. Don't worry, Master Jeff, all part of the show. [mysterious music] Please, enjoy. Who'd care for some champagne? - If you know, you need to tell me. - Master Jason, as we've already stated, the host cannot divulge any further information. However, he may not be the only person with something to share. Master Jeff, Perhaps you'd like some champagne. - I'm sorry, I truly had no idea. - It was you. - I suppose if you'd like to know, you'd have to take a seat. [host humming] - Do you know that Jeff sent several messages to his friends at dinner? They were voice notes actually, which means we could hear all the voices in the background. - And? - I wonder if you could explain this. - This could be your clean slate, Jason, your tabula rasa. And after you've done this, you know that you were wrong twice and that the offending lover will be punished on your behalf. They'll never know it's you though. Is that it? You can punish people with the truth. It's not a crime, is it? - You want to explain to your client that inciting violence is a crime? - Me? Can you prove I did all the horrible things you're suggesting, detective? My knowledge of the law may be a little rusty, but if a threat was made and then no one was harmed, did an actual crime take place? - Huh, exactly what threats are we talking about here? - Oh, none at all, my question was merely hypothetical, yes, hypothetical. - I, I think I'd like to leave. I can leave, right? It's just, I don't know, this feels like one of those nightmares where I can't wake up or like, maybe I'm in the middle of surgery and I'm supposed to be in a deep sleep, but I can see the surgeon and the scalpel and I'm trying to talk but I can't. I just really don't feel good about Eric leaving like that and now Jason. - Eva, my dear empath, you're of course free to go wherever you'd like, but I assure you Eric is fine. Would you like us to give him a call? I can give him a call right now if you'd like and then you'd see that he's perfectly safe and also $20,000 richer. And then you can be free to continue your journey with us tonight. Eric? - [Eric] Hello? - Hi dear. We were just wonder, well actually, Eva was just wondering if you were okay. She thought our driver might have left you for dead somewhere. - Oh, I didn't say that. - I assured her you were perfectly fine. - [Eric] I'm good. In fact, I just got to my favorite neighborhood dive bar. You ever been to Hank's? If Eva ever wants to find me, I'm there a lot, maybe too much. - Yes, dear, I'm sure they have perfectly lovely cocktails. Listen, for the rest of us, we're curious, did you check your bank account? - [Eric] Oh yeah and I was damn happy to see a $20,000 payment. Hey, is there any way I can talk to Eva for a second? I just- [phone beeping] - See, perfectly fine. - He said Hank's, right? - I think so. Sounds dirty. - Sounds perfect right now. Don't worry, I think that's my cue to go. I really do think I should leave. - It has been a bit intense tonight and I think I should go too, but thank you for a lovely dinner. - If she's leaving, my intended date, then there's not much left for me to do here. - Eva, darling, I understand love is finally waiting for you. Your car will be called immediately. Who would I be to stand in the way of that? And Jason, you've made it perfectly clear that you don't want us analyzing all your past relationships so if you'd like to go, please leave. Calvin, Cindy, I wonder if you'd stay with me for a while if I offered you Jason's compensation, $10,000 a split between the two of you. - Oh, is there dessert at least? - She can have mine, I don't do sugar really, but I'm game, this is fun. - Jason, I did not know it was you, I swear. - No, but you knew about me. You knew there was some poor fuck who's lover was walking out on him for you. Isn't that just as bad? [ominous music] Who was it? Richard, Steve or Allen? - [Jeff] I will not dignify that with an answer. - So tell me about Eva. - I already told you. - No, you said she asked to leave right before Jason lost his mind. - So I escorted her out. - And that's it? - What else would there be? Ah, Miss Eva, I paged your car, it'll be here momentarily. I am so sorry about things getting a little heated upstairs. These things do happen, but fear not, the car's on the way, no need to run. There. - I'm just worried about Jason. I feel like maybe he should leave and cool off. - Miss Eva, some men's tempers can't be quelled, best not to get involved. Miss Eva, was there something else? - I was wondering, is there any way I could have Eric's number? - Miss Eva, I'd be delighted to, but as per your waiver agreement, I'm sure you know, you're not allowed to communicate with anybody in the breakthrough experiment unless you made a joint breakthrough, which I'm sure Master Eric would've intended but alas. - So there's no way? - I really wish I could. But perhaps, Miss Eva, the universe will hear your prayers. Your car should be here momentarily. Would you excuse me? [gentle music] - Jeff stopped sending voice notes at 9:53, why is that? - I do feel quite badly about what happened then. That's about the time things got just out of hand. - Out of hand? Four people were killed. - And you know, technically that is mass murder. - How was I to know what would happen next? - Four fucking people. - Yes, four fucking people. You will not dignify that with an answer? You gonna let him get away with that? Wouldn't you like to know which one of your exes didn't think you were any better than some black guy? - I'm not playing this sick game, you hear me? - Who was it? - Do something. - So for the record, who attacked who first? - I beg your pardon? - Which guest at your dinner party from hell killed which other guest first? - You know, it all happened so fast, I don't know if I could definitively say. - Right, and you said that Jeff acted in self-defense, are you sure? - Yes. - So if we asked your master, would he be able to-- - He wasn't there. After I came back from escorting Miss Eva out, he'd stepped out for a moment. - Stepped out? - Just for a moment, yes. [ominous music] - Who was it? - Why does it matter now? - Guys, stop. - I'll stop when he tells me who it is. [mumbling in other room] I'm gonna count to three and you're gonna tell me who it was. Okay? Was it Richard, Steve, or Allen? One. - Party's over guys, seriously. - Two. - Please, just stop it, okay? - Three. Who was it? - Guys! - Who was it? [mysterious music] Tell me who- - Relax, relax! - Tell me the name! Tell me who it was! [glass shattering] - [Cindy] Call 911. [ominous music] - Oh shit. - Your butler says you stepped out of the room when Jason and Jeff began fighting. - Mmhmm. - In the middle of a heated argument? - Yep. - Where'd you go? - To change, dear. - Are you serious? [ominous music] [Jason groaning] - Call 911. Do something! There's too much blood, I can't stop it. Do something, please. What the fuck are you two doing? Seriously, call somebody. He's dying, help him. Jesus christ. There's too much blood, I can't stop it. - Oh, you're never gonna get all that blood to clot. Jason's a hemophiliac. - I can't take the rap for this. Am I gonna take the rap for this? - The rap? Oh, we're all your witnesses. Right, we all saw Jeff cut Jason's throat? - [Cindy] Oh my God. Oh my God. - You could have stopped this. You made this happen. You did this. Fuck! - Jeff, calm down, please. - You calm down. - Jeff, you're making it worse. Please calm down. - Just shut up, just shut up, let me think. - Jeff, stop. - [Jeff] Oh my God. [dramatic music] - Calvin. Calvin, no. Calvin, stop, please look at me. - How's it going? - Calvin, no, no, no, no, stop. [dramatic music] - It's okay. - You killed him. - Well at least they didn't kill the black guy first, huh? - [Detective Denver] You didn't stop them? - How could I have? I had no weapons. Obviously no superior strength. - So even as things progressed, you did nothing? - I certainly had no idea what was about to happen, okay? And when it did, uh. - Yes? - How were we to know we invited a sociopath to dinner? Not my fault, mere coincidence. - What are you doing? Why would you kill him? Calvin! - There you are, Calvin. - Oh my God. - I was hoping you'd come out to play with us tonight. It's okay, you're safe here with us. - Did you guys call 911? - Of course I did. - No, you didn't. - There's nothing you can do more now, dear, than just breathe. [breathing heavily] - What are you guys doing? You killed him. You fucking killed him. Calvin, why would you kill him? Who the fuck are you? Who are you? - Who the fuck are you? See, I don't like being played. - Oh dear, we didn't mean to make you feel used, certainly not our intention. Should we let Cindy in on the secret? [ominous music] - So help me out with something, will you? - I'm being as open and transparent as I can at all times. - Good. Well, imagine you were me, all right? And as me, the person sitting in front of you, well you know they're guilty, but something, boy, something's just not right. - My client will not play. - Oh it's okay, I don't mind a little role play. - Well, thank you. - Oh, consider your fantasies indulged, daddy. - I appreciate that. So something, something's just not right, or more to the point, maybe it's just that something's not quite adding up. - What would that be? Please tell. - Why? A motive for him doing what he's doing? - Maybe there isn't one. - Well, 30 years on the force would tell me, if you don't have a motive, then you don't know the whole story. - Like a puzzle? - Exactly. - You think you're missing a piece, don't you? - That's because I am. I'm missing a piece. [hand slamming on table] [host giggling] - How dramatic of you, I love it. - What's that? - Well, I'm no technical expert, but looks to me like a shitty TV. - No, see, you have 12 state of the art TVs in and around the house but that is a very, very special monitor designed solely to receive a live feed. - Is that so? - That is so, tech guys just confirmed it. - Well take another look. Yeah, it still looks like a shitty TV to me. - You know what it looks like to me. - What? - A motive. A motive. - A motive? - Did you know, dear, that there are only an estimated 20 serial killers in the US at any given time? Our Calvin has a tendency to fill into his basest of needs every single Valentine's Day. So have you shown up? - What? Why did you lie to me? - Such a bad boy, Calvin. - Stop it, you're scaring her. - You lied to me. - I'm scaring her? That's not even the best part. You know, Calvin here's been watching you for months and, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the boy isn't even a Pisces. - Who are you? You lied to me. [ominous music] Oh my God. Oh my God. - Hey, hey, hey. I'd never hurt you, huh? In fact, I just want to love you like the princess you are. Jeff was, well Jeff killed Jason. What was I supposed to, huh? What if he turned on you? Hey, it's gonna be okay, I promise, I promise. I just want to love you. I can be whoever you want me to be, okay? I can be like Frederick then with the heart of a mason. I can work out like that guy you liked, Michael, and I'll get you a coffee every morning from your favorite coffee house. Arbeus, right? White chocolate mocha. - Fuck you, get away from me! [ominous music] Get away from me, all of you. - Hey, we're gonna be fine, okay? I'm not gonna hurt you. - Stay away, I'm serious, get away from me. - What are you gonna do, Calvin? You killed this poor boy on Valentine's Day for Christ's sake in front of all these witnesses with your history. - Stop it. I need to think. - What happened? What'd you do? - Stop. - [Eva] What'd you do? - Eva, stop, let go. - Shit. [host and butler giggling] - What have you done? - I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry, I wouldn't hurt anybody. - You know what I just can't figure out? - I should think you can't figure out a great deal of things, detective. - The why. Like why did he do it? - Sociopaths must be so hard to predict. - No see, that's just it, they're not. They're not hard to predict at all. You just gotta know how to stimulate 'em, right? Like a dog wanting a bone. - It's not my area, I'm afraid. - My question to you is, are you that dog? Are you that dog just waiting to respond to his master's command? Is that you? - Detective, you really are clutching at straws now, aren't you? - 'Cause I'll tell you what I think. I think the two of you invited a sociopath to dinner and you just made an educated decision to trigger him exactly when you needed to. Is that what happened? - Could you tell me why we would want to do something like that? - See that's what I can't figure out. - You can't, not with all that wonderful imagination you have? - I can't. - Tell me, detective, is it a requirement of the police force for you to be so creative? - It is. - Calvin, Calvin, Calvin! Witnesses. [ominous music] - Calvin! [ominous music] [Eva breathing heavily] Someone help! [ominous music] [Eva breathing heavily] [doors shaking] [dramatic music] [Eva screaming] [dramatic music] - Eva. What made you do that? [ominous music] [Eva crying] [gunfire blasting] [gentle music] [Eva crying] - Hey, hey Eva, hey, you okay? Are you okay? [Eva crying] [gentle music] - [Eva] You came back? - For you. For you. [Eva crying] [gentle music] - [Detective Denver] Thank you for taking the time to talk to me again together. I know this whole thing was quite the ordeal for you. - Of course, we just want to help. - So you came back to the mansion? But why? After the host humiliated you, you came back. - There was something not right about those two. And when they hung up on me, well I just had a feeling in my gut that Eva was in trouble. You ever have that, that gut feeling? - Yeah, it's called instinct. I'd probably be dead without it in my job and it's a damn good thing that you listened to yours, but you brought a gun. So why not call the police if you're worried enough to bring a gun? - And say what? I was at a dinner party earlier where they humiliated me for $20,000 but now all of a sudden, I think they're murderers? It wouldn't have made any sense. It still doesn't make any sense. I do have a permit though for the gun. - Thanks for cooperating. We may need this later. For now you can have it back. Don't lose it. - I mean I just, I had to get back to Eva. I just thought, you know, to bring the gun just in case. All right, that place was sketchy as hell. When I got there, heard screams, her screams. - I... - So I ran to them. My heart just kind of took over. I didn't want to hurt Calvin or anything, all right I really didn't, but there wasn't another option. - I understand. I don't think you have anything to worry about, seems like pretty cut and dry self-defense. Eva, I know this is difficult, but do you remember anything else? Anything that could help us piece together who these men are and what they wanted? - I've racked my brain trying to think of anything else but, I was gone for probably 15 minutes waiting for that car. When I got back, the host, it was like a different person. I can verify what Eric was saying though, at least about, about the stuff when I was in the room. You know what? I didn't mean to- - Honey, that's enough. - It's okay, the brain takes over in these moments, it's fight or flight and your fight instinct told you to get that knife. - Look, she needs her rest. - Sure. It might have saved your life. You did good. Don't worry. We're gonna untangle this mess. Don't let him leave. - Thank God that's over. - Hey, how did you know I was in the room? - What do you mean? - I wasn't screaming. - Well, I heard something. You're just tired. You need to get some rest, okay? Just let me take care of you. - So I got four dead kids and two traumatized for life. Then there's you and your butler. And you know you don't have to actually pull the trigger to be a murderer, right, you know that? - Surely the serial killer wanted in one, two, three states is your first suspect. I don't want to tell you how to do your jobs detectives, but for me it's just an obvious now. - I'm sorry, what did you just say? - Calvin, I heard the lady cop over there say that Calvin was a serial killer. - No, you just said he was wanted in three states. - Calvin told us. When things got violent, he told us he was wanted in three states. - See but you didn't mention that. You said he attacked Jeff to protect Cindy, is that right? - Yes, that's what I said. There was also a lot of other shit going on. It just must have slipped my mind. - Right. - Let's talk about Calvin. He was wanted, right, in three states? - I'm not sure I would know that information. - I don't think I need to tell you this at this point, but your buddy has thrown you to the wolves, but you can still save yourself, we can make a deal. Why don't you just tell us everything that happened and we'll call the DA? - Detective, all we did was host a Valentine's Day dinner party and we told our young impressionable guests some truths. But you know what the real truth is? Love hurts. - Copy that. Sorry, detective, but we just got a call. - [Detective Denver] From who? - The DA. - How is Charlie? - But he hasn't made a deal yet. - Not for a deal. Turns out we are to suspend interviews immediately. [mysterious music] - Friends in high places. - I wanted to say thank you. - For what? - For coming back, saving me. [gentle music] - I'll always be here for you. You need to get some rest. - Will you be here when I wake up? - I will. I always will. - Look I wish I had more but that's all I got. The DA said we gotta let him go. - Well what kind of bureaucratic bullshit. - That guy's just seized Calvin Thompson's laptop. Thousands of pictures of Cindy Bellshaw, the gym, coffee shop, this guy had been stalking her for months. - He knew, he knew he'd been caught 'cause I asked him about Calvin being wanted in three states. - He was wanted in five states. - I know. - Well I'll tell you, they've been researching Calvin probably for months prior to the dinner. I'll tell you another thing, if Calvin's ever admitted how many states he was wanted in, he would've said five. - They fucked up. They fucked up and now the DA says we have to let them go. What kind of justice is that? - Detective, you know you have no right speaking to our client. - Oh, it's quite all right. You know we're innocent now, don't they? - No, we know you did it. We know you're responsible for those kids' deaths and that you pulled the strings somehow and we're gonna prove it. We'll get a break, you just wait. - Master, I do wonder, perhaps we should invite the detectives over for dinner sometime. - Perhaps. - Detectives. - [Man] Eva. Eva! Murderer! - [Nurse] Dr. Remington, dial 2226. - Can I help you guys? - No. - Oh, we're here just visiting an old friend, thank you. [mysterious music] - I hope everything was as ordered, sir. - You've done well. You're really not a half a bad actor. I'm lucky to have such great talent at my disposal. Oh yeah, of course. They're still there. But I'd get there sooner rather than later if I were you. - My family had nothing to do with this, you fucking monster. - I just needed the insurance to make sure you were on top of your game. - Was everything as expected, sir? - Oh yeah, played out perfectly. - Wonderful. - And he was right, she was just a girl who needed to be saved. The things we do for love. - Indeed, sir. Be a good boy. [mysterious music] - For Eva. - Aw, I almost forgot. Happy belated Valentine's Day. You can go now. - Enjoy the rest of your evening, sir. - I think I will. [ominous music] [gentle piano music]
