[gong] [music playing] HENDRIK: My name is van Thaal, Hendrik van Thaal, and all this happened along time ago, back in 1902. I had been fighting with the Boer commando against the British for three years. The war was nearly over, but we didn't know that. For months, the commando had been hunted and broken till there were only two of us left, Pieter Brandt and I. We were on the run, and my horse was going lame. How is he? He's still lame. He's been pushed too hard. We have a long way to go yet. If I could rest him for a couple of days... - You can't. - Well, I'm going to. Don't be a fool. He's finished. And if you stay up here, you'll be finished, too. [gun cocking] What are you going to do? You're not going to shoot him. We've got to get on. We can't cure him. Mind out of the way. HENDRIK: For a moment there I hated him. He was too cold-blooded. But he was right. We had to keep on to live, to reach home. I didn't want to kill him anymore than you did. I had to do it. Now pull yourself together. Fix your things to my saddle, and then we'll go. HENDRIK: We rode and walked, turn and turn about, across the veldt and into the mountains until sometimes it seemed we were the last men in the world. Pieter set the pace, and I knew what drove him on. He was going home for someone, someone who had been waiting there a long time. But the pace was too fast, too fast for me. [music playing] PIETER: The river. Hendrik, we found the river. [music playing] What's the matter with your foot? Nothing, just a blister. Let me see it. No, it's all right. It doesn't if I limp. You heard what I said. All right, you'll ride from now on. [music playing] HENDRIK: We went on through the mountains with Pieter on foot for day after day. But he couldn't last. Not even he could stand it. It was only the will to go that kept him on his feet. And I made up my mind what must come next. With still 200 miles to go, I had to take a chance, gave him his chance, too. Pieter? Yeah? You'll never get home with me like this. Oh, go to sleep. If I hang onto you, we'll both die. I'll get you home. Can't walk the whole way. It's 10 days beyond the mountains. You go on with the horse. I'll make for the river, make my way downstream [inaudible].. Sooner be captured by the British than die this way. So long, Pieter. [music playing] Good luck. [music playing] Hendrik! [music playing] Hendrik! [music playing] Hendrik! [music playing] Diamonds. [music playing] [birds chirping] [music playing] Anybody here? Yes? Is Dr. Barlow here? Dr. Barlow's dead. Where's Anne? Anne Barlow? WOMAN: She's gone. Dr. Wilson lives here now, and he's gone to Bannerton on a case. [music playing] I said get me a brandy! I'm dying of thirst. I don't care what Dominic told you. Put it on the bill. Don't stand there arguing. [inaudible] I tell you I'm dying of thirst. I want another brandy. What are you shouting about, mister? I want another drink, Dominic. You got the money? No, I rather thought this one might be on the house for a change. Not this house. If you can't pay, you'd better go. Oh, put it on a bill! You're making too much noise, mister. Come on. Pieter Brandt Oh, this is extraordinary. It really is you. Well, hello. Everyone said that you were dead two years ago. Get me a brandy. Make that two. You're paying? Yes, all right. Well, tell me, where have you been? With the commando, on the move the whole time. Everyone I knew here seems to have left. I thought you would have gone, too, back to England. Oh, no. Oh, I forgot. Of course, they won't have you. Tell me, are you the owner of this place? Yes. Well, I'd like a room for a week or so. All right. I'll fix you up. Where's your luggage? In the store across the way. I'll send for it. How long's he been here? Dominic? Oh, about a year or so. Crafty looking rat. Yes, he fits in here rather well. You've never liked this country, have you? Must have been embarrassing for you during the war. Did any of your ex-brother officers come through here? Yes, one or two. Did they see you? No, I'm not to speak to 'em. PIETER: I don't suppose they wanted to. One thing You can tell me... where's Anne Barlow? I came back to find her, and she's moved. You came back to find her? PIETER: Yes, is she still here? Yes, she's still here. In fact, I'll even take you to see her. No, there's no need to do that. - Just tell me. - Oh, no. I'll take you much better. Come on. Anne? I've waited three years for this moment. Oh, that's too long, much too long. Pieter? Pieter. They said you were dead. Oh, Pieter. I'll get rid of him. I'm his wife, Pieter. I married him a year ago. [music playing] [non-English singing] You're sober now? Night after night, you get drunk like a pig. You change this or I throw you out. You hear me? Three days you're crazy. That enough for you? I come in because the law officer wants you. You go down, or I send him up. Neither. Go away, [inaudible]. My fine room. Like a pig sty. Brandt? It's me, O'Connell. Get up. Get up on your feet and listen. Remember me? Anne married him because they told her you were dead. So she said. She's got to go on living. So have you. And if you were anything, you'd help her and not behave like a fool. Why are you up here, anyway? She wants to see you. Did she send you, or was it the bridegroom? It my idea. You used to be quite a man. I'd hoped you still were. O'Connell. Well? I'm over it now. I'll go and see her. I was trying to tell two ignorant yokels how to make some money. Another gold scheme? - Oh, Clive. - Well, why not? The country's crawling with it. Look at Johannesburg. We could do exactly the same with this place, but the idiots don't want to. It just doesn't make sense to me. What does make sense to you? You do. Yes, of course you do. Would you like me to tell you that every day? I suppose you would. Instead of mocking me? Yes. Perhaps it's knowing that I'd be no good without you. Why did you marry me, Clive? I was in love with you. I still am. You do believe that, don't you? You tell so many other lies. I never lied about that. [knocking] PIETER: Hunter? Oh, that's Pieter Brandt. O'Connell told me he was coming to see you again. And you didn't mind? Why should I, if you have no regrets? Please have no regrets. No regrets, Clive. PIETER: Hunter? Hello, Brandt. Come in. I'm afraid I owe you an apology for the other night, but I was a bit drunk. PIETER: Oh, forget about it. Hello, Anne. Can I bring you a drink? No, not for me. Well, for me, anyway. A smile for the loser, Anne. Are you the loser? I lost a lot of time... three years. The other night, it was like seeing a ghost. I said nothing I wanted to say, Pieter. Can't you say it now? The things I've got to say now are different. I've made my life. I can't unmake it. Do you love him? He's my husband. I suppose I should be grateful that he let me see you alone. Anne... I'm all right. Oh, Clive, I told Pieter he must come to your birthday party - this week. - Oh, but of course. It's the only night in the year I can get really drunk without everyone say how wicked it is. Well, what are you going to do? You're going back to gold mining? Or are you going to move on? Well, I can't move anywhere while I'm broke. And I'm not very well pleased with my country at the moment. Oh, forget the war. This country's at the turning point now. Turning? Which way? Towards anyone who faces up to it. It's rich in gold and wealth and power. Not here. Just because there are a few scratches in the ground? You'll see. Where those scratches are now, there'll be cities growing. You're descended from the Irish, a race of poets. I was born here. This is my country. Don't run away from it, friend. Then help me get a job. You know everything that goes on here. If I hear of anything, I'll tell you. Thanks. I need the money, badly. Did you see Anne Hunter? Yes. Not that it makes any sense, I... I'm seeing her again on Saturday. At this party? Yeah. Yes, I'm going, too. Yes, I know. She thinks a lot of you. [music playing] Oh, I wondered where you were. As the birthday man, I view the past with despondency and the future with some alarm. You got any money, Hunter? - Only what I make. - At what? Oh, deals I bring off, deals from the bottom of the pack, mostly. I've got to get some money. Listen to that tune. That takes me back, where I'll never go again. PIETER: Listen to me. You find somebody who'll pay for a trek to the mountains, and I'll make our fortunes. How? I planted some diamonds up there, a lot of diamonds. I've tried to raise the money, but I can't. I don't know anybody. You help me, and I'll cut you in. Where'd you get them from? Easy enough. From a dead man. A diamond smuggler, I suppose. Why did you leave them up there? I didn't know the war was over. I wasn't gonna risk being taken with them. How much would it cost to go back? Some 200 pounds? I know one way of getting some money. It might not appeal to you. Why not? It's a tricky game, one I've been waiting to play for some time. I'll join it. [music playing] Well, here it is, sealed up and finished. O'Connell owns it, but he's given up. It's no good, he says. And you say different? Well, I was up here a couple years ago with a mining engineer. Quietly, you know? What did you find? Oh, yes, he says there's gold in there, all right. But he couldn't do anything about it at the time. But you're a mining man. If he could find it, so could you. Supposing I do find it. Well, I'd make an offer to Jack O'Connell for the lease, then find my customer, and get the cash before paying O'Connell. You mean sell a property that isn't yours? Seems pretty rough on O'Connell. Oh, he's an idiot. He's always after Anne, booning around her like a spaniel. Besides, you want to get those diamonds, don't you? You can't get anything out of this country that you don't beat out of it. You fought for it for three years. What'd you get except three years older? And what have you got? Nothing. But, uh, I'll get O'Connell's mine. Well, how much lonher have we got to be in this frightful place? What? Are you finding anything out? Yes, a lot. This mine could be a good one, if you had the capital to work it. Well, that's why O'Connell gave it up. How can you tell? Look, you see this stuff that looks like plum pudding? Well, that's the edge of the reef. It's what's called a conglomerate reef. The black is carbon. There's gold there, a lot of gold. How much? Well, the reef here is shaped like a huge basin. They found the edge of the reef here, and then they faulted, and they lost it. But you could find it again? Yes, given the time and the money. Well, we've got plenty of time. If you dug up a ton of that stuff, crushed it, sorted it out, how much gold would you get? In a ton? Mhm. About as much as that button, if you're lucky. Do you want to be a miner? No. I want miners to work for me. Now come on, let's go home and take those samples into Joburg, and we'll get going. [inaudible] we took were from here. Now, that is a conglomerate reef. It was originally faulted there on his mark. But from out first assay of the new reef, we have found a considerable deposit of carbon, you see? There's certainly nothing wrong with the samples. Well, about three [inaudible] to the ton. That's what my man says. Hello, Brandt. How are you? I'm all right. I got your note. What's all this about? You went on a trip with Clive Hunter last week, didn't you? Yes. Did you go Bannerton way? No, the other way. Did you know I've got an old mine near Bannerton? A mine called the Drift? Have you? Yes. Hunter went poking around up there a couple of years ago. He didn't find anything up there then, yet suddenly he wants to buy the lease. Well, what's all this got to do with me? I'm offering you a job to go and value the mine for me while Hunter's in Joburg. So that's where he is. Your really do check on people, don't you? Well gentlemen, I shall get your our sales contract in 30 days. I'm going back to Karksville this evening. Meanwhile, we'll survey the place ourselves. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. Goodbye. Bye. - Waiter, bill. - Very good, sir. - There you are, sir. - Thank you. Pencil. Are you staying in the hotel, sir? Yes. I shall need my room for another week. Put that on the bill. Very good, sir. Oh, excuse me, sir. Uh, what was the name? Johnson. There you are. It's all yours. You're a hard bargainer, O'Connell. Still, we'll see. When's your crew going to open up the workings? Next week. My son's going up there with them. Oh, learning the business? Yes. Under me. This is the surveyor I used. I want you to meet Mr. van Thaal, - ...the new owner of the Drift. - Hello. This is Pieter Brandt. How are you? Hendrik. I traveled for three days, and then gave myself up to the British, only to find the war was over. The day after you left, I've... Hendrik, your father's got a lot of money, hasn't he? Quite a lot. PIETER: What's he like? Bit obstinate, cautious. Why? I've got a proposition I want to put to him. He leaves town in an hour. Well, then I'd better see him at once. I'd like you to come, too. Wait a minute. I've been looking for you. You know my hand was forced over that mine job for O'Connell. I had to do it. Very interesting. I told you I'd cut you in on my deal, and I will. How? Come with me and find out. I marked the place where I hid the diamonds. Why haven't you gone back there to fetch them before this? Because I haven't got any money. And to get some for a trek of this sort, the backer would have to be pretty sure of me. Why should I be? I guarantee him. You gambled in mines, why not gamble in men? It's much more interesting. Give me one of those. Look, I want 200 pounds for this trip, and I'll pay you back 10 to one. How do I know you won't just vanish with the money? Because I'd go with him, Father. - You? - Why not? Yes, why not? Then we can all three watch each other. Are you going? CLIVE: Well, I know all about it, don't I? Look, this is the route. We go by ox wagon as far as here, to this river, and then into the mountains. That country's not even mapped. I didn't need a map. I know where I'm going. All right, I'll put up the money, and I'll buy a chance. But I'll tell you this... I hate to lose. What about these IOUs, mister? Well, what about them? I don't play cards to win pieces of paper. I've had IOU's from you before. You'll get your money. When? When I... quite soon. You expect to make some money. How? That's my business, isn't it? Business you're up to with Pieter Brandt, hmm? And Mr. van Thaal. You're interested in gold, mister? Who told you so? DOMINIC: A detective from Joburg. He was asking for you here today, asking me. A detective. How dramatic. He called you Johnson. I didn't recognize the name, but I knew the touch. Now tell me what you're up to, mister, or I see the detective and I remember your name. Keep awake. You're paid to guard this, son. What's the matter with you? [inaudible] Leave it to these fools, and we'll lose the lot. Go easy. What's wrong? Everything's wrong. Prices are going up. We haven't got enough money. Unless your father can stake a bit more, we're done for. He's in the gold fields. Take about a week to find him. Well, I can't wait a week. Where's Hunter? He must know somebody who can raise something. Here, you check his list. I'll get him. Pieter. Is Clive here? No, he's out somewhere. I must find him. In Dominic's bar. [music playing] You've been crying. Yes. About him? Yes. Please, you must go now, Pieter. No. Yes, it's no good. You know it's no good. I've tried to stop loving you, Anne. Oh, Peter, I've told you, it's too late now. Are you always unhappy? No. If you hadn't come back, I'd never have been like this. PIETER: You wouldn't have been in love with him. You aren't now. For some things. He's helpless, and he needs me. I should've stayed away, but I couldn't. [music playing] MAN: You won't get my oxen, not without paying. PIETER: Well, I tell you I'll be back inside three weeks. I'll pay you then. MAN: You'll never start, not with my animals. No pay, no oxen. No go? No. I've got four animals, and I need eight. - So we're stuck. - Hello, Mr. Brandt. So you're short of money? Are we? I just heard you. Pity to lose the diamonds for the lack of so little... just four oxen, 60, 70 pounds. What are you talking about? CLIVE: I had to tell him. He says he'll buy a share, so why not? You can't keep your mouth shut, can you? You said you were out of money. If Mr. van Thaal believes your story, so do I. What odds do you pay him? 10 to one. You'd pay me 1,000 pounds for 100? But I don't tell you where I'm going. Oh, you don't trust me. Frankly, no. DOMINIC: Your father sends you to watch his money. All right, I'll send myself. I'll pay, but I'll come, too. And I like to gamble, you know? All right. Bring out your money. I'll take you. [music playing] HENDRIK: Well, that's how we started, the four of us. Dominic and Hunter went for the money, and I went because of Pieter. I didn't trust the other two. If we found the diamonds, Pieter was going to buy a share in the mine, and we were going to work it together, just as we'd planned it in those daydreams soldiers have about after the war. [music playing] All right. We'll camp here. [music playing] DOMINIC: Busy? CLIVE: Yes. And you? Don't want to dirty your hands. Yes, that's right. Where'd you get that smoke? Don't do that! DOMINIC: You stole it from my coat! CLIVE: Don't be a fool! DOMINIC: You stole it! Give it here! You know you oughtn't have brought those two. Well, I had no choice. We'll only just beat the rains as it is. You'll see. There'll be trouble. There always is trouble, wherever you go. [whistling] Well, you've lost 50 pounds already. Had enough? You that whistling infuriates him, don't you? Yes, so does losing. You're driving him too far. Why can't you leave him alone? If I get nothing else out of this trip, at least I'll get Dominic's money. What do you mean, nothing else? Perhaps I'm not so sure of Brandt as you are. You didn't soldier with him for three years. He was the best we had, never tired and never scared. These diamonds will give him the kind of chance he didn't have before. I very much hope so, for my sake, anyway. Goodnight. [music playing] Come on. Get them moving. [music playing] What will you do if this trip comes off, if we get the money? Pay it up in the gold fields. All we'll need there is capital. Then I'll go back to England. After six years, I can't wait. Don't you like it here? Living amongst all these peasants? [inaudible] Why didn't you go back to England before? No, when I go back, I'm going back in style or not at all. I should have thought... well, might be a bit difficult. Because I was cashiered from the army? What difference would that make? It, uh, depends what you did. Yes. Well, um, shall I say I was caught with my principles down? [music playing] [whistling] Listen to that whistling. Another six days like this, huh? Yeah. [music playing] Will you stop that whistling? Stop it, will you? [music playing] CLIVE: What's the trouble now? We must get to the river. [music playing] [non-English singing] HENDRIK: In five days, we struggled 100 miles towards the mountains. And all that time, I felt we were on the edge of a flare-up because of Hunter. He hated Dominic and made Dominic hate him. [non-English singing] [music playing] Now, we leave the cart and the boys on this side, and then cross over and go on on foot tomorrow. This river will be a raging torrent in a couple of weeks, and to ford it, we'd have to go 100 miles downstream. That's what the hurry's about. How far after that? Two, three days, with luck. Then we find the diamonds? PIETER: You'll see. - Hendrik, get your gun. It's out turn to shoot something for the pot. [non-English singing] Haven't you lost enough already? Leave the cards. You're 98 pounds in the red. What's the sense? Five days of this lunatic gambling. Bad luck can't last forever. My last hand. [whistling] Without the music. I'll open for a pound. One pound. One pound. I'll take one card. And one. Bet you five pounds. And five. This is a children's game, isn't it? Raise you 10. And 10. You're crazy. I've play cards with him a long time. I know how he plays. What's in the pot? 53 pounds. Make it 100. Well, that's so bad for nerves, that sort of thing. And 100. Where's your money? Where's yours? I got property... the hotel, the bar. Well? What you got left to bet with, mister? My house against your pub. It's your wife's house. Well, if it's hers, it's mine. PIETER: Look, stop this, both of you. Now don't you interfere. Now that's the bet... my house against your pub. That's rather frightening, isn't it? You're mad, both of you. All right. I'll see you. Four queens. A straight flush to a knave. Well, that means I'm in the hotel business, doesn't it? [music playing] PIETER: Wrong this time. I'd rather hurt mother's feelings. And you'd boys better go away somewhere. [music playing] PIETER: Dominic was convinced he'd been cheated, and nothing would shake him. He wouldn't even look at Hunter. He was all hate. [music playing] We were racing against time and weather, so Pieter tried a shortcut over the mountain. That's where we went wrong. [music playing] PIETER: Bush fire. We can't waste time going round it. Come on. Wait. This way. [music playing] [gunshot] [roaring] That brute's been following us all morning. Supposing Brandt can't find the diamonds, what'll you do then? He'll find them. Supposing he can't, this'll be rather an expensive trip for you, won't it? I could make you a bartender in my hotel. Or you could teach me to cheat at cards. Why not? You know every way there is. That's how you win and how you live! It's not how he won that game. You never worked and saved for years to own something to lose it on a foul. Shall I tell you how it feels? You bought that pub just by cheating a lot of drunks. DOMINIC: But I don't have the police after me, Mr. Johnson because I don't forge checks! You're not traveling, mister. You're on the run. You've got to keep going. Fancy talk won't win your pub back, you stupid... That's enough, the pair of you! One day, I'll put a bullet through that bartender's head. Back, not head. Back, that's you. [music playing] [grunt] [music playing] I'll take the gun. [music playing] Boy's nearly done. So you've left him behind. Well, I carry his gun, don't I? Well, this is a fine way to come up. Well, it saves half a day, going over the ridge rather than around it. - What's happened? - Oh, nothing. I'm all right. Just resting. What have you done to your hand? Cut it! It's just a scratch. Well, I hope it is. This is no country for the sick. Go on. [music playing] [whistling] Stop that whistling, will you? The bathroom's free now. Why don't you go and get cleaned up? Don't bother me! CLIVE: Don't raise your voice. Mother's not deaf. Hunter, it's your turn to shoot today. Get your gun. It's my turn to shoot today! See? I'm ready! Keep your whip down. It's me. I'm telling you... Dominic, you stay. I tell you... I'm telling because of the boy. We're not gonna take any chances with him. You can dress his hand. Hunter can't. CLIVE: Thank you. You'll stay. He goes. I'm going off, too. What for? To get the diamonds. Why don't we all go? Because I can travel faster alone. You wait here. This cut's infected. The whole arm's swelling up. Suppose Brandt don't come back, eh? You don't trust anyone, do you? Why should I? I've been cheated once. Don't go all through that again. Why not? Everything I had in the world, everything. And he thinks it's funny. You'll have your money from the diamonds. Yes, maybe. HENDRIK: You don't want to stay here. Why don't you go off and shoot? All right. Won't be long. Dominic. [music playing] When the mist came up, the others still hadn't returned. But I wasn't quite alone. There was a leopard in the rocks somewhere. [growling] I could hear him in every twig that moved and see him in every shadow. [music playing] Oh, it's you. You've been away hours. Got lost in the mist. Did you see Hunter? No. Pieter's not back yet. My arm's worse. Feels so heavy. [growling] Can't see a thing. [gunshot] [music playing] Why don't they come back? Maybe they don't mean to. They wouldn't leave us. Wouldn't they? If this mist clears by morning, better try and get back to the river. I'll send the boys for you. What about the others? I'll leave a note. I want to get away from this place. [music playing] [non-English speech] DOMINIC: Hey! Hey! Go and find him. One hour along the bank. Sick man. Go and get him and bring him here. How far is the wagon? One hour, boss. Hendrik. Yes? This was nailed to the wagon when I got back. Look. We've got to get you to a doctor. Can't stay here. Get the animals in! We've got to travel quickly! Hurry now! Hurry! [non-English speech] [non-English singing] What's the matter? Man coming, boss. DOMINIC: Who's there? Brandt. So you got back. Did you find the diamonds? Why did you run away? DOMINIC: To get the boy down the mountain while he could still walk, to get him to a doctor. Where is he? Here. His whole arm's poisoned. I asked you, did you find the diamonds? Get me the first aid box. You caught us up. Hunter with you? No, isn't he here? He left a note on the cart. Dominic said he found it. Look, I've got to lance your arm to let the poison out. Now? It's going to hurt, but I've got to do it. You'll have to help me. Hold him. Go on, hold him. Steady. Now. Easy. Will he be all right now? We'll know by morning. Now we'll talk. You got some explaining to do. I asked you twice, mister, what about those diamonds? You've got them. Yes, I've got them. Now about Hunter, Hendrik says a note was left on the cart. Let me see it. I haven't got it. - You threw it away, huh? - I suppose I did. I don't know. But I do know Hunter won't come back. Why not? The police want him. He can't come back. What, not to get his share of the diamonds or to collect the money that he won from you at cards? What was the real reason for the hurry? I told you, I was... I was thinking about the boy. Yeah? Well, now we'll think about Hunter. What are you going to do? In the morning, you'll take your gun and climb that ridge. I'll climb that one. We'll fire signal shots every 15 minutes until midday. And if he don't come back? We'll have to get on to Burgdorf. We've got to get that boy to a doctor. [gunshot] [gunshot] [music playing] Well, this is Burgdorf. Dog Now we can get you to a doctor. What about Hunter? Are you going back for him? Go back? He might be anywhere in those mountains. We'll just have to wait, I suppose. - I don't think he'll ever come. - Come on. Doctor finished with you? For today. Where have you been? To the police post, reporting about Hunter. Now it's up to them. Does, um Dominic know you've been there? No. What's the matter? You've got to go to the police. What for? To make a statement about Hunter. I've told them what I know. What is there for me to tell? I wonder. I told you Hunter never meant to come back with us. Well, if that's your story, you'd better go and tell them. But you don't believe it. No. They're sending out a search party as far as the river, and I'm going with them. Then when we get back, with or without Hunter, we can go home. HENDRIK: And be rich. Rich. Yes, you, your father, and Dominic. I'll just have money. HENDRIK: It took us a week to get home from Burgdorf after they'd called off the search. There was still no sign of hunter, not that Dominic seemed to care. Are you going to share up now? No. I'm gonna sell them in Johannesburg. Any objections? No. DOMINIC: Yes. PIETER: Why? We'll get a better price in Joburg. [door closing] It's too far away. You mean I might not come back. You don't trust me. Why should I trust you? And who gets Hunters share? His wife. Who says so? I do. So she can go and join him with the money. Why not? They owe everyone in town. You don't face facts, mister. I want my money now. I have my own plans. All right. I'll sell a few stones here, and pay you tomorrow. Jack, they've come back from this trip they made. Yes. And Clive isn't with them. I know. Why do you say it like that? I didn't expect him to be. Anne, this isn't very easy for me to say. After he'd gone on this trip, I had orders to arrest him. I'm sorry, but I just put off telling you. You think that news to me? What do you want him for? Forged checks, here and in Joburg. Then you think he ran away? It'd be in character. Would it? I'm not sure. Anne, why did they go on this trip, and where? Clive never told me. But don't you know? Not yet. Brandt and Dominic have been to the police. The van Thaal boy hasn't said a word. So I'd better start with him. [music playing] [non-English speech] You hear to look around? We're doing rather well. No, I came to see you about Clive Hunter. The other two reported. Why didn't you? Look out, boy. I was ill most of the time. I didn't know what was going on. Yes, that's the half I'm interested in. Did Hunter have any money when he cleared off? If he did, it was Dominic's money. They played cards all the time. Where did you go up there? Brandt led us. Have you asked him? He's not here. He's in Joburg with my father. You can telegraph him. And you have nothing else to tell me? Yes. I think Hunter's dead. Why don't you ask Dominic what he thinks, and why he's selling off his place in such a hurry, a place that isn't his? I'll ask Dominic. [music playing] PIETER: I'd seen the writing on the peg as soon as I picked it up, and I'd seen that writing before. I'd kept the note Hunter had left on the cart. I knew it was somewhere in my room. I wanted to be wrong. The writing on it had to be different. But it was the same. [music playing] DOMINIC: Hello, mister. They tell me you?re selling up and leaving town. Do they? Yes. Is it true or not? I mind my own business. It's my place. I can sell it if I want to. What else you come for? About your statement to the police after the trip. Where did you go, by the way? I don't have to tell that, either. You didn't like Hunter, did you? No. Neither did you. Had you any idea before he went that he might run away? I knew he was in trouble with you people, and he owed money. Your trip was to get money, wasn't it? Yes. But don't think Hunter wants to pay his debts. He doesn't. He wants money to go home. He said so. And ran off without it? He's got a wife, mister. What does that mean. Women are fools with men like him. The worse the man, the more they like him. Go on. You follow her, maybe you'll find him. Suppose I find him and bring him back. How will you like that? I won't be here. Oh, yes, you will. You don't leave town until I say so. Understand? Clive's life wasn't very pretty, was it? It was so full of twists and turns, but coming to the end is a shock. And the shock hasn't left me yet. Coming to the end? He's dead. I feel he's dead. I knew he'd never run away. I wonder. Hotel door's locked. - I want to put a bag in my room. - There's no rooms. I'm closed. Sold out. I'm going. All your things are packed and in the office except your gun. So take them away. My gun? Van Thaal boy said you told him he could borrow it. He was here an hour ago. Is he still in town? He went back to the mine. Maybe, I don't know. [non-English singing] PIETER: I went back to the mine. It was Saturday, and no one there. I had the note, and I had to have that peg. The man who'd written on both had signed his own death warrant. And I still didn't know what I was going to do. [footsteps] Jim? It's me. What have you got there? This is the note Hunter left on the wagon. And this is in your own handwriting, too. You planned the whole thing, didn't you? From the beginning. What are you going to do, Hendrik? I've got your gun. If they find Hunter and if they find the bullet, they'll know it's you. You don't think I'd tell O?Connell where we really went? I did it to get Anne. Hunter was no good. He had his life. And what about Anne's life? You can't cheat. She'll never know. HENDRIK: She must know. I can't let her take a murderer. You're going to tell? Hmm? HENDRIK: I've got to. Now I've got the gun. If I get that piece of paper, who will you tell? [gunshot] [running footsteps] Hendrik. Hendrik, listen. I helped you. Can't you help me? I've got to travel with murder all my life. Where are you? Where are you? I don't want to harm you. Just promise you won?t talk, you won't tell her. Give me the note, Hendrik. Hendrik! I can't lose her now. I haven't got anything else. Where are you? Where are you? Now... Ease up! Wait! Give me that paper. Give me that paper! Hendrik! [music playing] So that's the whole story. Yes. What are you going to do? What can I do? Does everyone have to know Brandt was a murderer? No one could prove it now. Suppose he hadn't followed you up there today. What would you have done? That's something I shall always wonder. [music playing]
