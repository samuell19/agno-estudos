To the children and young people of Latin America, in the hope that the subject of this film ceases to be a reality. In Venezuela, 7 million children live in a state of poverty, 4 million suffer from chronic malnutrition, 3 million are not in the school system and 600,000 are abandoned children. Violent deaths among minors are part of the daily life of Venezuelans, the bulk of which are result of vengeance, family violence and death at the hands of law enforcement. The most elementary human rights are violated in detention centers, which are overcrowded, and the scene of rape and abuse by police officers. These centers lack adequate meals and diseases go unattended. Venezuela is one of the richest countries in Latin America. However, in the last 40 years, far from being resolved, this problem has seriously worsened and led to social chaos. This film is based on real facts. Tell Waika to front me another. Waika's through giving credit! None of your business. Gimme that! It's mine! Give me a bottle! Who are you to order? You're not my father. Stop hitting me! Forgive me! Leaving him alone! Don't hit him! Don't hit him! Please stop that! Don't you ever come back! Get up, you scumbag! I said, get up. You know this is no place for sleeping. Now, get out, get out! I still don't know what happened. The harder I try, the less I can figure it out. There's no answer. Maybe there's nothing to understand. Maybe God decided to punish me because I was bad. It's probably a test I have to pass and then everything will be fine. And that guy will leave and I can go back home. Shit, this bird is dead. Oh, poor thing. No way! No way! This is as far as you go, Marquitos. - You think I'm a sissy? - I don't know anything, I swear! The hell you don't. Out with it, shithead! Where did Pelao put the product? OK, it's stashed away in the creek. Mr. Mocho, let me go. You're a gentleman. Oh yeah? Then why did you turn against me? Big mistake. Don't kill me, Mocho. Don't kill me, no! Rules here are kept quiet, die discreetly. You've already talked too much. OK, forget it! No way! Mocho! Mocho! Are you alone here? I'm waiting for my aunt. Ah, you are new on the streets. What? You got kicked out of your house. I said, I'm waiting for my aunt. Why the face? I fell down. Sure, buddy. Whatever. Let me see that. Look, dude. I'm not saying "Let me borrow it". I'm saying "Give it to me". Wait! - You going somewhere? - See you around. That priest has been after you again. Go on, ask him for money. Hurry up! The rules are clear. If you want something, you pay. And if you can't pay, you steal. You can always sell yourself, or beg. Did you ask him for money? Yes, but he didn't give me anything. He said you'll use it for your games. Sure, faggot. What did he want, then? The usual. For me to leave the streets. He says a family wants to adopt me. So... Well, he's gone. Already? OK? Next time, tell him I'll leave the streets. I'm deaf and dumb. Can I play? No. Let me play. Give me your Walkman. - Let me have it. - I don't have it. Who does? What are you doing here? Go away! Let me go, stop! Get out of here, get out! - What's up, Mocho? - All set? All set. The other deal's all set, too. OK. Hello? Yes, sir. Just a minute. Napole?n. Hello, Napo. Yes, buddy. Of course, I'll pay you. Don't worry, I have a good deal a couple of days from now. But I need some more product. OK. Don't get pissed off. I'll get you the rest of it this week. Motherfucker! Where's the coffee? If you want more coffee, you bring some. It's your own fault you're broke. I don't have a man to help me out. I used to have Wilfredo. Now all I have is this moron who doesn't help, doesn't bring anything. If I counted on your help, I'd be starving. When you shop for your woman, bring me some coffee. And some condoms. I'm all out. I can get you in on something. What? Easy. Just get some product through. I don't want trouble with the Law. I am the Law. The Law killed Wilfredo. If you say again you're the Law, I won't let you back in this house. Your son was killed for being a lowlife. You're the lowlife, worse, because you're in uniform. Get lost. I don't want you around. Here. This will help you out. Now, take it easy. - What are you doing here, buddy? - You're a lowlife, I'm a cop. Hey Chino, must be quite a life in that head of yours. No problems. - Hi! - Hey. Let's go, let's go. Get down, Chino. I told you to get down! Get down! - Give me gun! - Get out, damn it! You're a lowlife, I'm a cop! Chino, get up. No, I won't! This isn't enough. You said you were paying up front. I'll give you the rest. Trust me! Business is business. Big deals are made with a lot of balls. Respect comes after that. I have to pay up today. You're just gonna have to wait. Leave one out for me. Sir, give me a hot bun. We don't give anything away here. Put cheese on it, please. Are you deaf? Then let me have a Pepsi. Get lost. We have work to do. Give me one. The mustache looks good on you, ma'am. Don't ever shave it off... Stupid! Catch him! Catch him! You see others stealing, and you think you never would come to that. But you do. At first, it's scary. Your heart beats fast, and you don't dare. But one day you wake up mad at life, you are hungry and no one will feed you. - Let me have one. - Have? - Are you crazy? - Go find something yourself. Are you deaf? Get out! Get out! Go look through the garbage. Then your nerves turn to steel and nothing matters anymore. You just grab things furiously, you steal anything. Then you have food and everything else you need, and you feel that everyone owes you. You never asked to be here. This bottle is empty. Let's buy another one. How much have we got? Easy, or I'll kill you. Treacherous bitch! You're a dead man! I prefer to keep you alive, like the good old days. You know it's not my style to kill women. Son of bitch! How's the coke? Great, but tell Napole?n he's an asshole, he's mixing ours more now! Tell Mocho this is what he gets for what he did to Marquitos! Next time, I get my cock sucked, OK? If you are Mocho's girl, you've gotta be the best. And I have to sit here and let that scumbag take it all! We've already explained that. Stop your ranting. You were supposed to watch the money! What happened, Mocho? Shut up! You get your gang together. They are like family. Only they're not always the same ones. Sometimes, other dudes show up. They got thrown out, too, or nobody wanted to take care of them. Getting started is hard, you have to earn respect. I hang out with them because they're my friends. A little angel has escaped. Where can he be? Why did he go? Pelao, they've killed my son. They've killed him. How do you manage from now on? Here, take this. It will help. Here, you get your cock sucked! Pelao's gone. That's awful music. - But I like it, so? - Well, I don't. Oh, forget it. Here, forget your sorrows. We all have a destiny, and this seems to be mine. I sometimes wonder if destiny exists, and I see all those kids living around here, and I wonder where God is, to make peace with him. When I'm alone, I think of you. And I wonder how the house is. But sometimes I'm so hungry I can't think. My friends have taught me how not to feel hungry, but sometimes I'm so lonely. I need your love, Mom. I need it. Hey, Chino! Mocho! - What's up, dude? - What happened? - I have a job for you. - OK. A gun! Nothing's gonna go wrong. If you do what I say, I'll give a 38 just for you. Like Wilfredo? Like Wilfredo. It's a deal. Hey, Chino. Hey, stay with me! Hey... Chino... Cristina! Bye. Robber! No problem, no problem! Out on the Street you have to put on another face. Your mean face, otherwise they make fun of you. Then you find someone who shows you the way, who's also full of misery in body and mind. He'll show you how to survive. He's so full of misery, as if he were carrying everyone's misery. How old are you? I bet you aren't even 15! How about you? I'm over 15. I've gotten ahead in life! What the hell is wrong with that? That moron broke it. Well, go ahead. Can you feel the rush? I'm getting dizzy. It must be like that. What's that? It's from my own stash. You have to keep some stashed away, you know. And where did the pretty face come from? No, it's no good! He's coming, he's coming! Don't you ever come back here, damn it! I'm fed up with you, damn kids. These are all a bunch of sissies who'll never make it. Sissies? Yes, scumbags... whom no one respects, because they always get their buddies in trouble. People respect me, they know I'm not brown-nosing anybody. Right, Palma? You've gotta be true to your buddies. And learn how to use a gun. So what are you gonna be, a sissy or a lowlife? Make up your mind, I don't hang out with sissies, or cowards. You believe in this crap? What? That little Virgin. My grandmother gave it to me. Give it to me. Let the sissy keep his Virgin, he's gonna need her tonight. Let's get going. Let's go. Promise me something. What? That you'll never hurt me again, not in front of them. They won't respect me. Get in! Are you scared? I'm not scared. Then, do it! Don't be such a sissy. A dead man doesn't cry! You should be scared of people on this side of the world, especially if they are cops! Get in, then. What are you waiting for? This shithead is wetting his pants! You're a dead man! He's dead! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! No problem. Let's go out of here. Get dressed, Napole?n is outside waiting for you. I'm not gonna be waiting for you forever. You have to be on time in this business. Stop nagging me. I said I would pay. I heard about Pelao. You also heard about Paco's death? Pelao will get caught... The guy's hiding now, but I'll be waiting for him. You have until tomorrow to pay me. Well, tomorrow then! You've been careless lately. And you know it: if you get careless, you get caught. I'm not getting caught. Here, people respect me or they're mad at me. Put your things in order. There's a lot of people wanting your turf. Chino! Look, a stash! I want to have my own stash, like Pechund?o. There? You won't tell, will you? No way, no way! Watch it for me. Let's go, let's go. Chino is called a moron by everyone. He doesn't like it. Not there. Don't put that there, get going. To me, Chino is my friend. He's like a brother now. He brought me here so I could help. Keep still. Move over there, push over, move it! Chino, you come with me! Shut up, shut up! Move over, move! Hit the floor! Anyone who moves, I'll take him out! Move it, move it! Hit the floor, asshole! Grab it, grab it! My arm! Go get it fixed! Hey, buddy, bring that bag here! Where did that rat come from? He's my friend Oliver! No problem. Gimme that, Chino. Put it away or I'll take it from you! No problem, no problem. Hell, dude, we're fucked up! Bet it was a trap. Do I get down here with the guns? Let Chino take them down. Here! Go down and walk till you pass the check point. Wait right here. All right! Get down, damn it! Who is the kid? - He's mine. - Yours? Got the car papers? I forgot them. You forgot them? So what are we gonna do? It's OK. Just this once, it's OK. Get going. I'll go round and come back for you. Hurry up! Give me that and get lost. Get lost, I said! No problem, no problem! How long have you been on the streets? I live with my mother. My mother got killed when I was your age. And you hit the streets? That's where I come from. Mocho knows everything about the streets. But he's already made it. He makes big deals. He says people like us have to learn to play hard ball with anyone. Because life plays a hard game and we have to play hard right back. Are you the boss here? What do you think? Of course I'm boss. If I stay on the streets, I want to be like him. I want to be respected. - Are they afraid of you? - No way. They need me. But there are others over me. Where are they? Stop asking so many questions! - What are you doing here? - Shitting. Damn it, I told you to get lost! OK, OK! OK, the ride's over. You haven't seen me, OK? Otherwise we've got a problem. OK! Get over here, Oliver! Where have you been hiding? Let me borrow that. It'll solve a few problems for me. How come you know Mocho? My brother Wilfredo and Mocho are buddies. You have a brother... He got killed. - Who killed him? - The cops. Mocho's tough. Nobody messes with him or his bum leg. But we are pals. You know what he told the cop? That I was his kid. Chino! What did you do? Are you crazy? - It's OK. I'm not gonna wait here all night. You have to wait, the boss is coming. He should've been waiting for me. I'm the one who is paying. You don't seem too happy with the Colombian guy. I'm nobody's fool. If they wanna mess with me, I'll jump ahead of them. Come here. Come, there's something I want to show you. You should see this. Alone. Fakir was a boss, but he got into debt. Heroine? One and a half million in greenbacks. Where is he taking that? Amsterdam. It pays well. Will that repay the debt? No, that debt is forever. Napo let him live. Now he'll decide whether to use him as a mule or a dealer. How about you? What's in it for you? Not enough. I should get more. So, why are you still working with Napo? I'm trying to make a deal with you. Fakir is off to the airport tomorrow at 6:00 am. Some cops are taking him. Got it? You take care of Fakir. I'll take care of Napo. Fifty-fifty, then we split the product. That's the end of your debt. You answer to me from now on, and I'll let you manage the business from here. Deal! Deal! All he does is smooch with Beatriz. He wants the money for himself, but he's not fooling me. Mocho is a friend, he's a gentleman. He's nobody's friend. He just wants money! Mocho gives us what we deserve. Why else would everyone here be on his side? Because he looks after us. If it weren't for him, we'd be starving. Look at your shoes, and your clothes. Would you have them without him? I earned the shoes. Nobody ever gave me anything for free. I've worked too hard for Mocho. I want my own business now. Get out of here. But don't go the way of Pelao, get your own turf. The business here belongs to Mocho, and you know that. It's a big city and Mocho is not forever. Would you come with me? I don't know. I can do a lot for you. Come on, come on, come on! The money. Gimme the money! Come on, Chino, let's get out of here! My gun! You pick it up later! - My gun, my gun! - You pick it up later! Now! You and your crap! Take me with you! Sure, I'll take you. Of course I'll take you. Hey buddy, what are you doing here alone? Try this. It's better than the shit you guys smoke. Try it again. Are you for real? This time you're not leaving without giving me some money. You can't come here unless I want you to. I haven't got any money. Ah, you liar! Are you hot? Let go of me! Let go of me! Let him go, you faggot! That shithead got away with it last time. But you wait and see, someday I'll blow his brains out, put him in a garbage bag and throw him in the Guaire. Well, he's gone. So? That faggot didn't have bad taste, eh, pretty face? Don't go away. Do you have any glue? I wanna fly. I haven't got any. You're not leaving me here all alone, without so much as a kiss? I just saved your ass! - Tell your boss to call me. - OK. He's gone. Let's go! Get going, don't lose sight of him! No problem, no problem! Now, show some respect! What are you doing here? What are you doing in your brother's room? You know I don't want you to mess with his things. You're not Wilfredo, you are a moron. You'll never be like him, you moron. Now, get lost. Wait. Come here. Sit here. See this? You know who gave it to me? The Law. The Law gives me money, and I give them the product. The Law gives me money, and I give them the product. What do you think of that? The Law killed Wilfredo. Now, you are all I have! Mocho says he's killed several guys, and that he'll never go to prison. Chino says even the cops respect him. I wonder what war is like. It should be the same: people who hate each other, take drugs, steal, kill each other. And what for? I'm at the site. Left pectoral region. It is presumed to be a nine-caliber bullet. I chose the inspector myself, who went to the airport with him. He was absolutely trusted. Don't look at me as if you didn't trust me. You're mistaken. I could keep this business for myself, if I wanted. But it was a deal, we were partners. It could have been him. No, it wasn't C?sar! How can you be so sure? OK, kid, I don't interfere with anyone. All I want is my share. I'm getting another shipment from the office tomorrow. I'll pay you then. OK. I'll leave it to you. But if I were you, I would look inside the house. Everything is set up. We're just waiting for the van. OK, Maldonado. Now we're really in the dough. Don't get carried away. We each get out share. Nothing has changed that, don't forget. We are always in people's way. They call us the plague. People get impatient, nervous, they think we're going to hold them up. We're always being watched, the cops are always watching. They shove us out of everywhere, they say we're not wanted, that people hate us. We learn to defend ourselves. You just kick your way through, so they'll leave you alone. But they usually win. They hit you. They insult you. And if you act up, then they beat you for taking their money, for being a lowlife, for being on the streets. It's like having to pay to exist. You never tire of being a shithead, don't you? - We're letting you go. - Let him go. Get lost! Look at the scars. They make others leave me alone. These were the last ones, from an inspector because I wouldn't let him pester me. He stuck the blade in several times, here. To survive on the streets, you have to make people respect you. Now, if you're chicken, go buy a piggy-bank. That's better! That's tough, kid. You should have caught it sooner. Go ahead. That's it! Check that one! Here's one! There's still some left. Pass the glue. Don't give it to her. She's taking advantage. I'm not talking to you! Get out of here! Look, kid, where are your manners? You gotta stay away from that girl. I went with her for a while, but I got rid of her. She can't even kiss. She bites your lips! Is that priest after Navas again? Never mind, let's go. Some people want to help us off the streets. In fact, some kids are really lucky. When you get bigger, it's harder. Nobody has offered me anything. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like, if that man had never come. If we weren't poor, if we didn't have to live in this slum, if my real father came back for us, if we had enough food. I like to daydream, to think about these things. If I really think about them, they might come true. But if they don't, I'll play hard ball. That's how life has played with me! Hey, Oliver got himself a new chick! What's the matter, dude? - I don't like being made a fool of. - Wanna go home to Mommy? Keep my Mom out of this. She must be a saint. That's why you're here! Hey kid, get lost. Ciao, take care! Shit! Oliver, my friend, it's all right, it's all right! How much are we selling this for, Pechund?o? No, get in the car and bring out your part. Shit, dude, share with me. I'm not here to take care of you. I stole this myself. Get lost! Are you deaf? Get lost! But I prepared the area for you. Won't you even give me a few rocks? What area? I'm the one who broke the car window! Stop it, Pechund?o! - Is there anything left in the car? - A toolbox, if you want it... Go for it! Hey, guess what. We're going dancing! - Let's go. This is ready, boss. - How much do I owe you? - For you it's nothing. Here, help yourself. Thank you. What's the occasion? My birthday. Birthday? I'm here for my share. I'll pay, don't rush me. Don't rush? I'm tired of your pestering. I'm the one who is tired. You pay me tomorrow or we've got a problem. Here, have a beer! What's the deal? - How much do you want for that? - 50. Done. Hey, Pelao! Hey! The boat is coming at about 11 am. There's time. Time is what we haven't got. That's worth trillions. All laundered greenbacks! With white dust, even the ministry takes its share. That's the way to go, think big. Everyone else simply helps you get there. There he comes. Why are you looking at me like that? Something wrong with my face? Just forget it, C?sar. Hello, Mocho? What's up? It's all ready. Yes, I have someone who will take the product. Yes, I'll let you know when the flight is confirmed. OK, green light! Cristina! Cristina! Stop, hands up! No problem, no problem! What are you doing here? I came to see you. What's the matter with your eyes? Nothing. You're high! That T-shirt is mine. Now it belongs to Ram?n. Mother... Can I stay here tonight? Are you crazy? Sebasti?n will kill you! Leave now. Bless me. God bless you. Now go! Can I come and see you? What are you laughing at, sissy? What are you doing? Can't you see? You have to tale care of your shoes, they're your image. You know anything about Chino? Who's Chino? The moron. No, I haven't seen him. You've gained weight. What did you expect? I'm almost 2 months pregnant. You're not getting rid of this one. I want it. It's been days since I've heard from Chino. The last time I saw him, the cops almost got us. They say he was taken to the institute. Many have ended up there, after getting caught. The cops say it will fix us up, but it's actually worse. They take your clothes, your shoes, they rape you. Sometimes the teachers deal out drugs. How can that fix you up? If you have a problem with anyone, you end up stabbed. I haven't been there yet. But if I ever get slammed, I won't take it. I'll get out. I don't want to. - What's the matter with you? - Let go of me! Oh, really! I don't want to do it! - Come here. - I said no! Well, why not? You know why not. I talked to my mom on the phone today. She said she had a room for us and the kids. I told you I would go. But first, I have to take care of some business. Business? What business? I don't want a scumbag with me my whole life. I want a man who'll provide. I'll take care of you. You don't take care of anyone. You're just a robot, a coward, a faggot! - Where did you get these? - What? The shoes. They're mine. They're great. They're mine. I know that, motherfucker. You're a moron. Everyone here has to pay. If you so much as stray, you'll get it on your ass! - No problem. The shoes, take them off! Go on, go on. There's nothing here, dude! Get your hands out. What is that? There's nothing here. There's the scumbag, the owner! Let's do it, I'm hungry. Let me have some soup. Here, but you go have it outside. Give me some food. I'm hungry. Stop bothering me. I already gave your friend some food. Ask him. Get out, now! - Give me something. - Get away, kid! Let go of me! Let go! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! Fuck him! Where's Chino? Hey, we're sleeping! Are you crazy? - Where is he? - How would I know? What do you want him for? None of your business! Get inside. Put that away, Pajarito, take it easy. Tell me where he is. Where's the motherfucker? Easy, put that away, and tell me what the matter is. The guns you sold to Mocho... Chino took them, and also the heroine. What heroine are you talking about? The one we stole from Napole?n. From Napole?n? Who stole it? Come on, tell me. Trust me. Chino. Chino? You're kidding! I have to find him, no matter what, or they'll kill me. - How do you know he did it? - Of course he did it. I saw him shitting near the stash. What are you going to do? Find him, and then kill him! I think you'd better hide. Mocho will be looking for you, and you can't go around without protection, you'll pay for it. So what do I do? Go away with your girl and your kid. I'll take charge. I'll be in touch. Don't worry, OK? Here! I've been in all of the detention centers and escaped from every one of them. And I'll get out of here, too, and quick, you know? I know the way. Those guards at the gate pay no attention, they couldn't care less. If you leave, you're one less they have to take care of. The ball, quick, the ball. William, get over here! Here, play. Run, they're rioting! Look at the fight! Come on, Chino! Get going, get going. - We'll have to open up! - Right! - No, they'll kill us! - No, we have to wait for the police. - The keys! - No, hurry up! Not yet! There's a big fire. There's a big fire. Call the cops, do something! Oh my God, please! My God! So, what's with the deal? Nothing. I can't do anything. The deal was you had to come here with Mocho's weapons and the product and I'd receive you. But what do you do? You come here empty-handed, asking for protection. What do you want me to do? Your problems with Mocho are none of my business. So get out... Get lost! Get out! Hello, C?sar? It's me, Pelao. OK. Buddy, no problem. The 1.5 Kg of heroine you guys stole from Napo. Of course, but wait. Mocho just pretended he was help up. What do you mean? Take it easy. That's what friends are for! Hey! Where are you going? Sit down. Sit here. We're going to talk business. What's in it for me? First, you tell me where that moron Chino is. What do I get? Three of crack... Do you have it on you? Now, tell me. I heard from a friend that the cops found him with a gun and took him. I already knew that. So, where's my pay? Let's go. Help! What's the matter? Get up! Get up, girl! They killed her, Mocho. No... No... No, it can't be true. What do we do then? First I have to ensure you are telling the truth. - Sure it is, you'll see. Then, keep still. I know who will be interested in what's next. How about the guns? I'm interested in the guns. And you? All I want is a Walkman. Get going. Do it! We've got it made! Chino! Oliver, my friend! - Where did you get those guns? - From Mocho. Mocho? Gimme that, you scumbag! Put that down, Chino, he's my friend! Wait, wait, wait! Motherfuckers! Beatricita... they killed her! Sons of bitches! Beatricita... Shit, it's too much! My girl and my kid! Easy, Mocho. Mocho says there's no reason to wait. Only the present makes sense. Hey, dude, where are you going? To see Pelao. Life doesn't matter. - Looking good. - Go ahead! Wearing good clothes, gold chains... Pull up your shirt! Give me the gun. Come on! Get in, buddy. What's the matter, kid? What's the deal? Try this. You try it, it's pure coke. Pure heroine! Let me see. Hell, this coke is bad! It's no good. How much will you give me? 100 K, just to keep you happy. You know that's not much. 150. That's it. OK. Give the money to this kid. Here. Watch yourself, kid, I'm for real. Then, tell that jerk to give me back my gun. Sure. Can I go now? Go. And come back whenever you like. Did you rob a bank? None of your business! Don't get in trouble again, Chino! No way, no way. Hurry up with the food, we are hungry. What do you think? Our money is as good as anyone's. As good as theirs. What's this? Billie Holiday? Who's that? It came with the Walkman. - It's lousy! - But I like it. OK, so you like it. Let me borrow it, I wanna hear it. Take it easy, dude! Hello. Where's Mom? She's working. And Sebasti?n? What's with the fancy clothes? I earned them. Didn't you bring me anything? I brought this for Mom. Give it to her when she comes back. Don't let that creep see it, he'll take it away from her. I'll come back some other time. Hey, kid! Come on! Tell him to send me another bottle. Hey, dude! Hey! I have what you're missing. What do you want? My turf. You know that's my life. How much do you want? 30% for me. That's a lot of money. What if I deal out all of the product? 25% to start. If you are any good, I'll raise it. The raise comes after the first sale. OK. You'll have the product on Monday. I'm counting on it. There they are! Turn around, Peralta, we're gonna take them! Roger, we're coming. I'm not afraid anymore. If I have to stay, I'll stay here. I may never be the same again. But it doesn't matter. That's the way I feel. - Take it. - Yes. What's the matter, pretty face? Aren't you gonna dance? What's the matter, aren't you giving it to me? Well, then? Oliver... my friend! OK... It's all right, it's all right. Come here, kid. She's really crazy! Chino! Let's get out of here, the cops are coming! Show some respect, you shithead! Oliver, my friend! Oliver! My friend! Get up! Get up! Get up! Oliver, my friend! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Oliver! Shit, buddy! Oliver! Get up! Oliver! Don't leave me, my friend! Don't leave me! Oliver! Don't leave me, Oliver! Oliver! You are my buddy. You are my real buddy. Look, this little medal. It's yours. No problem! You know there's no problem! It's all right. Mother, the last time I saw you, you looked pretty. The way I always dream of you, pretty and kind. I know you're not coming here, because you are too busy. If you come, you won't find me on the streets. I'm here now, somewhere else. Where the stars went out forever. No one disturbs me here, I don't feel the cold or the heat. Nobody talks to me, I'm not hungry or thirsty. What I thought would happen, never did. And even if life was hard on me, I think from here. I hope you and my little brother get the chance I never got. They say death is part of life. But even if it is so, I prefer life... I prefer life.
