Subtitling provided by Wolfe Video. Got him. Roll. All right. Can l talk to him? l work at St. Paul's. l've got to talk to him. Scott, what happened? Fucker called me out, and along came death; just like you said. Hope that fucker was ready to meet the Lord, 'cause l sure as hell wasn't. Scott-- Get the fuck out of here, man. Look, Scott-- Get the fuck out of here. Hello. These things are heavy. Yeah. Thanks, man. So you going to show me how to do this? You're going to paint dressed like that? Yeah. Why not? Well, l don't know. You might get paint on your nice clothes. No, l will not. l will be very, very careful. Didn't we use to call you king klutz? ln second grade when you were slow. Knock yourself out. Alex, it's a wall, not a Picasso. Rachel. Hey, come on in. Hey, guys. Hey, Rachel. Peter, this is Rachel Doucette, my friend and ally since freshman year. Hi. Hi. How are--ooh. l'm sorry. Rachel's another summer school refugee. Yeah, l'm trying to get out of here a semester early. l've been telling her all about you, Peter. Oh, that must have been very boring. Beyond belief. So how's the painting coming? Oh, good. Look, look. lsn't it beautiful? l see Alex has been a big help. Oh, yeah. lt would've taken me weeks to do those two boards by myself. Yeah, and look at him. He's covered with paint. lt's terrible. Well, l'm sure if l look closely enough-- Oh, l'm sorry. l just-- l couldn't help it. All right, Rachel. That's it. When you least expect it, my revenge will be swift and terrible. Ooh. l appreciate it. Marlene, thank you. Oh, it's so good to see you. l was wondering when-- when you would come. Yeah, l wanted to get my place fixed up first. What is-- what is all this? lt's for the soup kitchen. During the summer, we like to grow our own vegetables. lt saves money. Well, you've got some weeding to do here. Yeah. You look good, Peter. So did you-- did you talk to admissions about midterm enrollment? No. What are you planning to do? As little as possible. Well, that's one strategy. Little as possible? You know, Peter-- Don't--don't start. l'm not going back to Albany. You hit a little roadblock down there, huh? Little? lt's not a little roadblock. l know. You were trying-- trying to help that kid. What was his name? Scott? Yeah. Some serious shit went down. That's the world. You know that's the world. That's why you went to St. Paul's, to build the strength to deal with that kind of thing. l'm not going back. You don't have to decide that right now. But the prayers, the rules, and all these good intentions, they have nothing to do-- zero to do with reality. l'm through with it. The rules always made me crazy too, but l never gave up on the prayer. You know, l used to pray all the time, ever since l was a kid. But ever since Albany, it's just seemed silly. Like, who am l talking to? Who's listening to that? l can't do it anymore. What does this mean: ''The day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night''? The day of the Lord is like the second coming. lt's like judgment day. That's saying that that day will come when you least expect it, like a thief in the night. clang So, like, you never know when you're going to die? No. No, no, it's talking about Christ coming back to earth. lt's not talking about death. No, it's talking about death. See, that's why the Bible's so cool. lt doesn't fuck around. Whoa. You keep it up, kid, you'll be playing in the majors. 'Cause l never go to town. Don't need to hang around. What could l do for her? l'm just a pretender. She's got just enough changing. Oh, no. Hey, Peter, come over here. Yeah, Father Peter, get over here. Bring up some sauce from the back, please, sir. Back the fuck off, seriously. Hey, Father, we got a dispute. Robert here is pissed off, man. His neighbor's dog is barking and barking and waking up everybody really early. So Robert says he's going to shoot the dog, but you know Edgar. He's telling Robert to lay off. See, if you're going to shoot somebody, you should shoot the faggot who owns the dog. lt is his fault the fucking dog is barking. Back the fuck off, or l'll fucking shoot you. So what do you think? Shoot the neighbor or shoot the dog? Yeah, come on, dude, this is serious. A dog's life is at stake, man. Totally. Shoot 'em both. Who is it? lt's Peter. Hi, um-- Hey, Alex. Oh, hey, man. Look who's here. Wow. Pretty wild, huh? l would never sleep in this room. Like you'd ever get the chance. l mean, this stuff would just-- it'd give me nightmares. Okay, boys and girls, let's just concentrate here. Who's going to win the series? The Red Sox? What are you, crazy? Here, you'd better send those back. They're defective. You've got defective deities. You just contracted a jungle curse. You want to get a beer? l was going to get a beer, you guys. Um, you guys go. l-l have to write this paper. No, no, no, no, you can come with us. No, no, no, no. l have a beer, and the night is wasted. You'd do me a favor, actually, because l've been trying to get Alex out of here for hours. See, the truth about Rachel reveals itself. She pretends to be a free spirit, but all she does is write papers. Maybe some other time. Call me. My baby is not crazy. That was Grown Man's Hands by Aaron Hondros. This is Jody Rose broadcasting WPOl, Pemberwick College. We've got news coming up in ten minutes, and we'll tell you the details on the two guys that got beat up last night near the quad. Campus authorities say it could be linked to a series of hate crimes directed at gays and lesbians. Another beautiful day today. A little hazy this morning, but it should clear up in the P.M. Highs in the upper 80s,; cooler tonight and tomorrow. Scott? Scott? You don't have to live like this, you know. You know, Peter, um, that's not where l am, okay? That's not my life. That's bullshit. No, bullshit. You can be anything you want to be. What the fuck do you know? Yeah, well, Peter's always been different. He's very deep. Oh, God. No, no, no. lt's in a good way. He thinks about things. He's an homme serieux. That's French. lt means-- l know what it means. lt means he's a pain in the ass. You like him. Hmm, well, look, just be gentle with him, okay? Because unlike moi, he's very inexperienced with women. Hmm. Hi. Hi. l hope you don't mind. l, um--l stopped by to say hello, but you weren't here. No, um, that's okay. l mean, if you decide to live in a shack like this-- You never know who's going to wander in. That's right. You seem a little tense. No, l'm, just, um-- l'm just surprised to see you. That's all. Oh. A bad surprise? No, a good one. Would it be okay if l kissed you? Sure--sure. So you were studying to be a priest? Oh, l dropped out. l was going to be an Episcopalian priest. So why'd you drop out? Well, um, l thought the people who were priests, or who were g-- would be, uh, like, you know-- going to be priests would be-- um, were-- What? Like, um-- like my two roommates. One of them wanted to make a lot of money, like being a priest is the obvious way to get rich. And the other one was really quiet. l mean, he was always chuckling and nodding all the time, but you could-- so l-l didn't really fit in. Uh-huh. And, um, at first, l was still going to church and, um, praying, but, uh, l'm too hairy. You left the seminary because you're too hairy? Yeah, l'm too hairy. l'm covered with hair. Your chest doesn't look that hairy. They're little-- little hairs. So why are you living in this shack? l wanted someplace quiet. Shhh. You're really beautiful. You're pretty beautiful yourself. Can l ask you something? What? You won't get offended? What? Was that your first time? l mean, since you were in the seminary and everything? Why? 'Cause you wanted to be celibate. No, Episcopalian priests don't have to be celibate. Most of them are married, you know. They're not supposed to fool around. Nobody's supposed to fool around. So you were a virgin? No. Look, it's just-- it's been a while, okay? Can-- can we talk about something else, please? Sure. You're not going to, um, write a paper about this, are you? Maybe. You undressed him? l know. l can't believe l did it. Oh, he is just-- he's so-- l just felt so powerful. You don't have to get naked every time you feel powerful. You know Alex? He thinks he arranged the whole thing. Well, l'm jealous. l mean, this place is so dead during the summer. Oh, l'm sure there's another lonely priest around here somewhere. Look, l don't need a priest, just someone who's shy, lives in a shack, and'll let me strip him naked. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That sounds like fornication to me. Yep. That's what it was. lt was pure animal fornication. l don't sense any contrition. Oh, well, l left my contrition at the seminary. Now l'm just an ordinary sinner just like everyone else. l hate to break it to you, Peter, but you will never be an ordinary sinner, not you. One thing is confusing to me, though. What's that? Seeing as how you have lost your faith and abandoned the church, why are you telling me all this? Are we, um-- are we talking or working? So, Peter, l hear you've got a hot new girlfriend. Peter's got a new girlfriend? Oh, who is it, man? So much for the sanctity of the confession. That was confession? l thought it was bragging. lt's no big deal. No big deal? Did she dump you already? Yeah, where is she? She didn't dump him. She's doing her homework. She had to go wash her hair? No, she's got a headache. Poor guy. l told her that. l told her that if you want to come over to the-- Faggots. What the fuck? Friends and neighbors, l hear the good news. Joshua's trumpet bears witness to the truth and the light that-- my friend? My friend, do you know Jesus? Do you know Jesus died for your sins? He died so that you could have life eternal. Life eternal. That is a gift that he offers you. Hey, guys. What's he doing here? Looks like he's sunbathing. What? Don't you think it's kind of weird to see a priest in a bathing suit? l think he's gorgeous. lt's you l'm worried about. splash Alex, come on in. The water's great. splash! Ooh, it's freezing! Oh, you are such a baby. Hey, come here. Come here. What? Why--why is Peter ignoring me? Well, 'cause he's with Father Ed. So. So Father Ed is the priest in Peter's church. He's the guy that talked him into the seminary. Oh. Mmm. Here, l got an idea. Turn around. What? What? Turn around. What are you doing? What are you doing? l told you, Rachel: revenge when you least expect it. What's going on? He stole my top, and he won't give it back. Oh, my God. Give it back! l told you. splash! Oh, give it back, now. Traitor. Traitor, that's mine. Give it back to me. Give it-- Traitor. Hey, you guys, look. splash! That was incredible. He should be careful. lt's not that deep, and there's a lot of rocks down there. Don't worry about Father Ed. Okay, l'm going to get out. Me too. Hey, can you get me a towel? So who's this Ogden guy? He lives across the hall from me. l felt sorry for him, so l let him tag along. Come on, let's go. Help me up, will you? Hey, Peter? Hey, we're going to grab a couple burgers. You coming? l'll, uh-- l'll catch you later. Peter? l'll catch you later. So you know when you do that dive that you're pretty much just a big show-off, right? Yeah. Pride is a tough sin. lt catches us all. Pride isn't only about showing off, though. You know, l feel a sermon coming on here. lt's pride to walk away from God, trying to hide from him. Yeah? Yeah. Well, l'm not the only one hiding, then, am l? What does that mean? The other night outside Mike's. Okay, no sermons, not today, anyway. But why don't you come to church on Sunday? l'm working on a doozy. You know, l don't go to church anymore. Well, maybe you can make an exception this one time. lt would mean a lot to me. What's that? lt's an old coin. Oh yeah? ls it worth anything? Somebody gave it to me. He, uh--he used to dive off these high cliffs into the ocean. And every once in a while, he'd find these old coins down there in the rocks. And he said to me, ''This just goes to show you ''that even when the world looks most dangerous, sometimes a light shines in the darkness. '' Let's see. l-l don't see anything. Keep it. Doesn't mean anything. Good to see you. Good morning. We know that many people describe marriage as, uh--as warfare, as the battle of the sexes. And l hope that here today we can talk about sex and love without causing any bloodshed. Now, love and the marriage bond that sanctifies love is one of God's greatest gifts to us, one of his most wonderful divine mysteries. l think that it is inherently a part of our nature and yet unknowable at its source. Who knows why a man chooses a certain woman to be his wife? Who understands the chemistry that leads a woman to choose a certain man to be her husband? And who can say why one man falls in love with another man-- or a woman with another woman? There have been a number of incidents recently involving the harassment of gay students on campus and in the greater community. People have used passages from the Bible to justify this kind of harassment. Leviticus 20:1 3. And today we will discuss whether the Bible really condemns homosexuals the way some say it does. Leviticus 20.;13. Shhh. lt's okay. You're Ogden, right? You have something to say? Yeah, um, Leviticus 20:1 3. ''lf a man lies with a male as with a female, ''they both have committed an abomination. They shall be put to death.'' What does that passage mean to you? That the Bible condemns homosexuals. And they should be put to death? That's what it says. Be quiet. No, no, no, please. Let him speak. Many people agree with this point of view. Leviticus, in the context of the specific time and place in which it was written, says homosexuals should be put to death. He also says that children who curse their parents should be put to death, adulterers should be put to death. What do you think about that? l don't try to interpret the Bible. l just try to believe it and live it. That's a righteous undertaking. And in--in trying to live the Bible, would you feel justified to kill a homosexual? l-l don't know any homosexuals. l've never had to make that decision. That's a cop-out, isn't it? Well, it's the truth. You may believe it's the truth, but it's not. You know at least one homosexual, because you know me. l have never taken extraordinary measures to hide my sexual orientation, but l-l haven't publicized it either. The fact is, l'm gay. Should l therefore be put to death? What do you say? l-l'd say that-- that everyone in this congregation should pray for Father Ed. He is not alone in his beliefs. l have prayed long and hard for an answer as to why l feel the way l feel. But in the end, l can't explain it any more than l can explain why l'm mortal or why God created sex and love in the first place. l'm sorry. l should have talked to you before l-- Oh, come on. After what that little jerk said, you had no choice. Yeah, well, l-- We can handle this. Great sermon, Father. l appreciate that, Bill. That took a lot of courage, Father. Thank you, Mrs. Scherm. l'll see you next week? Yes, you will. Thanks. Hey. That was really stupid. When the Lord opens a door for you, Peter, you need to walk through. Well, you didn't have to go that far. Well, somebody had to say something. l don't know if it's students or if this radical Christian cell in town is responsible, but the intimidation has to stop. l mean, you really believe what you say in there makes a difference? You tell me. Does it? May--maybe it does. What do you mean, ''his lover''? l'm talking about Father Ed, Mike's boyfriend. Ow. Boyfriend? You mean Mike's a faggot? You're such a fucking idiot, man. Well, how was l supposed to know, man? Guys, guys, guys, be cool, huh? Dude, l'm cool, okay? lt's just-- Just that you're so stupid your brain fell out of your head and you stepped on it. Fuck you. Shut up, asshole. So you're saying the priest's a faggot too? Oh, man, l'm going to fucking kill you. What? You're being such a dick. Dude, l don't know this shit, man. Why the fuck are you coming down on me all the time? What the fuck, man? We're just talking. See, you're lucky. You're lucky, 'cause l was going to kick your ass. Okay, man. Shut the fuck up. Go, go. Fuck you, man. You know it's too hot to be doing this, right? You know, we should do this when it cools down a little bit, maybe. lt's not that hot. Maybe not for a crazy Mexican. Oh, yeah, yeah. You know the trouble with gringos? They got no stamina. You know, l was thinking that we should do tacos at the soup kitchen on Friday. Tacos? You lost your mind? You think people would like that? Sure, they would, 'cause people are probably getting sick of that meat loaf. l know l would be. For your information, my foolish young friend, l make a great meat loaf. Mmm, that's--that's funny, 'cause just 'cause you haven't been arrested doesn't mean it's a great meat loaf, okay? Whoa, whoops. Oh, man, l'm sorry. What is that? What are you doing? l was just messing around. What are you mad at? l'm not mad. lt's just-- look, l'm not used to hanging out with a priest. Look, he's just a guy. Yeah, well, maybe to you. But to the rest of us, it's a little weird. Did you think it was weird when l was at the seminary? Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, l did. Huh. Why? You're not thinking of going back, are you? Peter? ''But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness''-- my friend. Thank you. Yes, God bless you. ''And all these things shall be added unto you.'' That's St. Matthew, verse 6 and 33. l-l don't know anything about it. Look, Father Ed mentioned once something about a radical Christian group in town. l think he called it a--a cell. Do you know what he was talking about? There are lots of church groups. No, not a church group, a radical Christian cell. Well, there's this guy named Parish. l think it's Bill Parish. He works at the York Street station, and l know he's got a prayer group. Bill Parish. Kill time. Got any maps? Yeah, in the rack in the office. l hope he knows what he's doing. Anything else, you guys? Can you, um, check the oil? Sure. Looks good. Good. Great. Um, how about the rest of it? The rest of what? Oh, uh, the brake fluid. Peter said the brakes were squishy on the way over. Yeah, that's right, squishy. Okay, then. Can l help you? Yeah, l was just looking at your bulletin board. This isn't public. lt's for employees only. Sorry. Do you know Bill Parish? l'm Bill Parish. What do you want? l don't know what you're up to, Parish, but it better stop. Come on, faggot. Let's see what you got. Come on. Try and hit me with that motherfucking wrench. Come on, son of a bitch. Come on, huh? Come on. No, you hit me. See, l was arrested for assaulting a police officer. lf l hit you, they'll put me in jail. But you can hit me. What the fuck are you talking about? l'm telling you to hit me, asshole. Go ahead. Beat the crap out of me. You're fucking crazy. Peter. Let's go. l want to know who printed that flyer. l don't know nothing about it. You should have seen the look on his face. Peter's or Parish's? l didn't even do anything. Oh. lt was so stupid. What was the point? The universe is black. lt's black. lt's empty. lt's meaningless. Oh, spare us. lt's the truth. You're just too scared to admit it. And this is meaningless too? This what? This. You, me, Rachel? This is meaningless? Probably. No, that's not truth, man. That's despair. lf you're going to drink, drink to something. Let's drink to friendship. No, not friendship, Alex. lt's chance, okay? You were a guy growing up on my block. Rachel's some girl you met in college. No, you're wrong. lt's not chance. lt's destiny, and you don't-- you don't piss away destiny. You--you treasure it, protect it, and fight for it. l mean--look, you came to Pemberwick-- l came to Pemberwick because l had nowhere else to go. No, because you were supposed to, because this bond between you, me, and Rachel, this is rare and precious and right. And it's a gift, man, and l'm not going to sit here and listen to you piss it away. l'm sorry, man. To Peter. Yeah. To Rachel. To us. Look, l got this aunt who lives in Boston. She rents out this house, and it's a beautiful little brick row house right near Bunker Hill. l mean, it's across from a park, and it's got this yard and everything. And why don't we go there after graduation, l mean, the three of us? We can go there and-- and work and live together and-- l mean-- look, Boston's a great town. And the place has got two bedrooms: one for you guys, one for me. And, Rachel, l know that you don't cook, but l do. And, l mean, well, we can be there and help each other. What do you think? Well, that's a long ways away. l mean, do we have to make reservations right now? l'm just hoping we can get home in one piece. What are you doing? So what do you think about my idea, my aunt's house in Boston? That's a good-- that's a good idea, right? What do l think? l think, ''Why do we need two bedrooms?'' Stay. Pizza run? Are you drunk? l'm buying. Come on. Hey, Mike. Can we get a couple slices? Cheese? Yeah, and how about some pepperoni? l'll have mushrooms. You got it. Beer? Yeah. Of course, yeah. Make that two. So how's, uh-- how are you doing, Mike? You hanging in there? Good. Doing good. Do l know you? Yeah, l know you from the chapel. Ed's sermon. You're the little prick who stood up and made all the goddamn noise. Who the hell do you think are, huh? You stand up in church? Who the hell do you think you are? l'm sorry if-- if he's a friend of yours, but, uh, what Father Ed said in his sermon was wrong. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Ed is an ordained priest. What the fuck do you know? l-l know my Bible. l'm sorry if you don't like it, but l-l know what the Bible says. And l know what l say. Get the hell out of my restaurant. No, hey, hey, hey, take it easy. Take your hands off of me. All right, look, we're leaving, all right? Come on, Ogden. Let's go. Read your Bible, friend. You'll see that l'm right. Ogden, is it? How'd you like to be a martyr, Ogden? l'm not afraid of you. Well, you should be. Look, Mike, l'm sorry. Get--get out. Never mind. Never mind. Scott, what happened? Scott? l hope that fucker was ready to meet the Lord, 'cause l sure as hell wasn't. Scott, what happened? Fucker called me out, and along came death; just like you said. Look-- Just get the fuck out of here, l said. Get the fuck off me, you fucking asshole! Hey, hey, stand back. thud Are you okay? Yeah, l'm--l'm fine. You? Seriously hung over. Mmm, second that. And my clothes are still on. You trying to ruin my reputation? Yeah, more research. Hey, you put my poster up. Yeah, you haven't been here in a while. Whose fault is that? So what do you believe in? What do you mean? Well, you study all these religions. What do you believe in? Well, you study all these different cultures from all over the world, and they all believe in some kind of god, so l guess there must be something out there. Something what? Some kind of god. Or maybe it's just a flaw in the human gene pool. Maybe we're all programmed to believe in a god because if we didn't we would just commit suicide or something, you know? Maybe it's a survival thing. l-l talk too much, don't l? Sometimes. l made the reservations for the cape. ls that the last week in August? Right. l can barely wait. You going to close the restaurant? l thought l'd let Robert give it a shot. He seems like a nice boy. splash! Ed? Ed? Ed! splash! Peter? He's in there. Oh, you look like shit, man. All right, let's go. Let's get up. Oh, God. All right, hang on. You got him? Yeah. Jesus. Come on, what are we doing here? We are going to take care of this garden. lt's in memory of Father Ed. And guess what? You are going to help. ln memory of Father Ed, you should let everything die. What? Yeah, let all these little green plants here just wither up and die. No, l don't think so, Peter. lt's time to move on. lt's cruel to raise up all these little vegetables only to cut 'em down and then serve 'em to a bunch of skaggy poor people. What are you doing? Stop it. thud Stop it. l am tired of all this black shit. Come on. Ow. Cut it out. Let go of me. Ow. Get off me. Give it-- Ow. You son of a bitch. Ow, damn it. rip! So you've stopped caring about everything? lncluding me? Sure. You know, when l first met you, l thought, ''Wow, this guy is different. He's got things he believes in, and he's someone special.'' But that just goes to show you that you're not the only one who could be really fucking stupid. tink l'm an asshole. clang! You've got 1 5 minutes. Hey. How are you? How do you think? What are you doing here, man? Well, l wanted to see you. l wanted to see how you were doing. l-l hear, uh--hear you dropped out of the seminary. Yeah. Why? l blew it; l should never have let you-- Hey. Hey. You didn't blow it, okay? l blew it. What do you expect from a dumb fucker like me, huh? At least you tried. Yeah, they, um, won't let me wear it. Can't have anything around my neck, you know, so-- so l won't strangle myself. Rachel, look, l-- What? What do you want? That first night when we slept together, l told you that l left the seminary because of my roommates. That-- that wasn't true. l don't even know you. Look, l left because l was working with this gay kid named Scott. He got in a fight and killed someone. He killed someone for hassling him. l came here to try and figure out where to go next. l mean, l was going to be a priest. And then Father Ed-- l-l just lost it. And l know l've totally screwed things up between us, but-- l tried running away once. l'm not going to do it again. splash! Rachel, what are you doing? What? When you were-- when you were going under the water and coming back up, what were you doing? Just bouncing-- bouncing on the rocks on the bottom. First we have to demonstrate that these rocks didn't use to be there. Second, we have to demonstrate that a person or persons put the rocks there; it wasn't an act of nature. Third, we have to find the person or persons who put these rocks there,; and fourth-- this is the tough one-- we have to prove that whoever did it put the rocks there with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Well, if you could find the person who put the rocks there, wouldn't the rest just fall lnto place? You know, a lot of people have died at that quarry over the years. Been a lot of accidents. Father Ed dove there every day. He was an experienced diver. We'll look into it. splash Mike? Yeah? Did Peter tell you about the rocks at the quarry? What rocks? Come on. Let's sit down a minute and talk. Well, l was at the quarry a couple of weeks ago, late. Doing what? What do you think? Trying to get laid. Anyway, we saw this guy in a rowboat. Now, l didn't pay attention at the time. But after talking to Peter-- What? l think this asshole was dropping rocks right where Father Ed used to dive, just like Peter said. l mean, he's in a rowboat going back and forth, back and forth. Now, l didn't think about it at the time, but it makes sense. What else could he have been doing? Who was it? l don't know. What do you mean you don't know? l don't know his name, but l've seen him before in here. Remember those two guys you chased out of here? lt's one of those guys. Ogden? Rachel, l'm trying to reach Alex. Alex. Look, meet me at Ogden's room in, uh-- in five minutes. Just do it. What's up, kid? Look, come with me, okay? What the fuck? Just get in the damn car. What's up? You son of a-- What are you doing? This son of a bitch moved those rocks. Now he's going to die the same way Ed did. Let the police handle this. No, l didn't do anything. Just shut up. You put those rocks right where you knew Ed dove every day. No, l didn't. Robert saw you, okay? Who's Robert? He saw you at the quarry. And he remembered you the night l chased you out of my place. The night l came with Alex? He saw you in the boat! He saw me? Mike, let's just take it to the cops, man. Come on. Let's take it to the cops, man. Come on. No way. Mike, don't do it. Come on, don't do this. Please. All right. All right. Let's take it to the cops. Look, l'll, um-- l'll meet you there. Come on. Oh, hi, guys. You did it, didn't you? You son of a bitch. Look, l only put the rocks there. l didn't make him dive. Why? 'Cause three into four will not go, man. What, what's that supposed to mean? He was pulling you away from me and from Rachel. He was my friend. No, he wanted you back in the seminary, and you would've gone there. Alex, just come down. Come down. Fuck. So much for that house in Boston. No, just come down. You know, it's a black universe. You said so yourself, Peter. God damn it, Alex, just get down from there. lt's black and empty and meaningless. Those are just words. He didn't mean it. Well, you know, he shouldn't say things that he doesn't mean. No! No. What are you-- Get off. Let go of me. No. splash! Peter? Alex? Peter? Alex? Alex! Peter! Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Where's Alex? He didn't-- Alex? Alex? Alex? Hi. Hey. l didn't expect you back so soon. Hoping you could run out on me? lt was a short service. Nobody knew what to say. l should have gone. Do you think l'm running away? No. You're just going someplace quiet. That's what you said that first night that you came to Pemberwick.; because you were looking for someplace quiet. There's no quiet place. No guarantees, anyway. l'm never going to understand why he did it, you know? So when can l visit? l don't know. Once l'm settled. Safe journey. Thanks. Bye, Deborah. See you. Hey, hey. What's going on? We figured you could use some help. What are you doing? Preparing for open-heart surgery, asshole? Hey, man, you gotta have the right tool for the job. lt's a Zen thing. Hey, what's up? He's got his good days, and he's got his bad days. Hey, watch it with the fucking rake, man. Why don't you watch it with your fucking language, man? This is a church garden. l better keep an eye on these guys. Hey, thanks for coming over. Thank you. Oh, yeah, duckin' isn't good! Subtitling provided by Wolfe Video.
