How was your day? Same as yesterday. You're done with school. What are your plans after the summer? I don't know? Hey, I got the job at the warehouse. - Recycling plastic. - It's work. Heaps of people around here don't even have jobs. I promised your mother you'd make something of yourself, and that's why I've decided if you don't have a better plan after the summer... You're joining the army. - What? - You heard me. You got six weeks to decide what you're gonna do with your life. - That's bullshit. - Watch your mouth. Look, I know the army isn't a flash life, but this is something you can be proud of. Oi! Loser, we're gonna be late. Coming. Sarge, the army's your thing. If you don't find something better, it'll be your thing, too. Tu, hurry up! Let's go. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Young, young sid. Young, young, young sid, ho. Young, young sid. Young, young, young sid. Young, young sid. Young, young, young sid. What's your name now? Sidney diamond, fresh off confinement. Ready for assignment, kill my rivals. No gang beside him I solo-ride in any province I'm king. North and south island, put your hands up I'm back. Change the climate, chasing climates. Choking on a cohiba. Sculling back Cuba libres. Eating lots of seviche in another time zone. Where it's no habla ingl? Bonita se? Rita. Won't believe it till you see it. Who's the freaking man now? Recognize I ain't need no artist and repertoire. Tell me... I already know. Hey, check my own records, boy. Boss... playa del Carmen. Breaking the broads in, aw... Sunshine, skin tan. Now, that's Karma for my losses. You see that? It's your dreams. You can never hold on to my seams. Ain't no other rap cat in n. Z. Besides one... with me. Forget your instagrams and your tweets I'm out here, getting horsed on a beach. Yo, I'm a stylish... Right now I bet you wish you were me 2pk, 2pk, 2pk, 2pk, 2pk, 2pk! Army or no army, you're always part of the crew, cuz. Forget that. I am not joining the army. What else are you gonna do? Yo, Tu! Check it out. Yo! - That's bad. - Far out. I'll flick you the link. Cheers, bro. If we want to rip it up at regionals, we have to start going harder. Yeah, like that's gonna happen. Straight up. If only everyone just focused. What do you care? You're off to uni soon anyway. Bro, I'm not going anywhere without that scholarship. You're brainy. Uni-level. You got this. Maybe I should join the army. What? I'd be a better soldier than you would. Yeah, probs. Chin up. Sarge might change his mind. Not even. See you tomorrow, loser. Later, nerd. We got to get you ready for boot camp, soldier. Rise and shine! Up and up! Up and up, son. We are moving! Life isn't a box of chocolates. We couldn't afford chocolates, so I had no idea. Come on, son. Don't let your old man show you up. - Hold up! - To the top. You'll do better tomorrow, son. Tomorrow? What? And every day until you enlist. We'll find something better to do with your life. What if I do have something? Recycling plastics doesn't count, son. - Forget it. - Okay. Well, tell me, then. - Hip. - Hop. What? - Hip. - Hop! Dancing! No, mate. Nice try. I mean a real job, Tu. That is a real job. People make mean money going all around the world. People like your mates from work? You think they'll make it big anytime soon? Moving. This heat is bullshit. Aw, man. There's only one damn fan in this whole building. Got any sprays? Yeah, in the back pocket. - Bro. - What? Don't tell me you're holding at work. I'm not holding at work. I'm not gonna leave it at home. My auntie would thrash me with a jandal. Well, are you using that or what? Look at this place, man. Yo, are you Tu kaea? It depends. Who's asking? You might want to check that attitude, bro. - Bro! - Brant, relax. We didn't come all this way to start trouble. We saw your clip. - Not bad. - Thanks. Kane thinks you have what it takes to join our crew. I... I've already got a crew. So we've come all this way for nothing? Hey... Can I think about it? - This is a one. - Time offer. Studio's on the north shore. Address is on the site. Be there at 4:00 or don't bother. Hope to see you there. Who was that? Bro, you're not gonna believe it. That was K-crew. - Real?! Like the k. - Crew? - The k. - Crew. They want me to audition, man. Should I do it? Hell yes! This could be it for you! This could be your chance to get out of this place and to do it big. I don't know. Look, imagine you're me and your best mate just got given the opportunity of a lifetime dropped in his lap. Now, what would you tell him to do? What do I tell the others? - Nothing. - But Vonnie. Vonnie don't need to know. No one needs to know, not till they need to know. Yeah. I guess you're right. I know I'm right, and so do you. K-crew. It's there. Pretty mean. Sort of get in early, get out early kind of thing? I've been working with kids on their school holidays for 20 years, and no one's ever wanted to start their shift earlier. Since my dad's got me up at the ass crack of dawn, I reckon I'd just start the day. 6:00 on the dot. Don't make me regret it. I won't. Try and keep up, old man. Good to see you finally showed up, son. Check it out, 1, 2. Hey, yo, hey, yo I came a long way since back in the day. From a teenager tryin' to make it, rappin' this way. Ever since I was a kid, I had somethin' to say. Rockin' Mikes was the dream, I didn't care about pay I sacrificed late nights and goin' out with my friends. Just to stay home alone with my pad and my pen. Had my eyes on my prize, my mind on my goal. As I carved these rhymes out with my heart and my soul I didn't have a cd, all I had was a tape. On the dole through my flow was my only escape. From a world where they didn't want to see me prevail. Don't want to see me take it all. They'd rather see me fail. It's like I was down and out, struggling. Wondered how I'm gonna make it through I got a dream. All I had was a pad and a pen. Holding on. Wondered how. I got a dream. I won't let go 'cause I got... Come on. Thanks for coming. Really stoked to have you here. We've seen your footage. You know you got the moves, but do you have what it takes? Behind me are the best dancers in New Zealand, among some of the best in the world. And with myself, we make up the K-crew's national team. Three-time world champions. Yeah, buddy. You have six weeks before regionals to show us what you got. You show us you got the k-factor, you're in K-crew. But if you're ever late or you don't show up, I will cut you. I don't care if you're sick. I don't care if you have jobs. Either we're your priority or we're not. And if we're not, leave now. All right then. Brant, take them through. All right, guys, we're doing basic choreography. Here we go. Music. Let's do it. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's close. But for it to work, you have to do it just like everyone else. Watch me. Better. So, you know everyone here? Kind of. I know of everyone here. What's her story? Sasha? Moved over last year. Been repping out competitions ever since. Moved from where? New York. - Is she with Kane? - Better believe it. Off-limits, Romeo. Yo, you guys both made it in. Next session's tricks, though. Sweet. Thanks, brant. - Trick. - Whatever. You fellas got a beef? Let's just say not everyone is as comfortable with my sexuality as I am. - What a dick. - I'm used to it. Hater's gonna hate. I bet they're gonna work us like dogs to get us ready for regionals. Woof, woof. Tu. Tu, come on. Wake up. Thanks. Bro, they've got a massive studio... All these mirrors, locker room, showers. Sweet setup. So party on the north shore, is it? Nah. We'll party on the shore if I make the crew. So when do you find that out? Six weeks of auditions. Six weeks? Oi. Is Phil all good with you working half days that long? I'm here at 6:00, opening up shop. Look at you? Can you flip me the key so I can hustle some green? Uncle Tucker's been bugging me for a new spot. This place is busy, but low-key it is and heaps of places to stash my stuff. Just 'cause I ain't gonna dob you doesn't mean I'm gonna help you out. Yeah, yeah. But I'm serious about a party on the shore, though. Put a little brown in browns bay. Got the "little" part right. Go from this last part. Smash it out. 5, 6, 7, and 8. Go 1 and 2 and 3 and ta. Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, boom, ka. - Yes? - Okay, all good. Practice that. Take a break. We'll come back to it. Crew not good enough for you anymore, docks? Yeah, my auntie said that she seen you on the bus going to the north shore. What's up with that, man? Yeah... Are you gonna tell them, or should I? What? Tell them what? Gather around. - What's happening? - I've got an announcement. Benjy, don't. What's up? On me. Tu's in love with a shore girl. Sad, but true. - It's nothing serious. - Nothing serious? Hell, she got this maori catching a bus for three hours two days a week. What? Boy's whooped! - This boy's wet! - Yeah. Well... When a rich, white girl call for him lord! Take a break. He got to ride that bus to the north shore. Yeah! If he want it, he got to ride it so he can wine it baby, baby if he want it, he got to ride it. Benjy, what? So he can grind it baby, baby if you want it, you got to ride it till you can grind it. - See you fellas later. - Peace. Bro, stop stalling. You've got to... Hey, Tucker, it's Benjy. What?! Yo, Tu! "G," do you remember that video I made of you? Yeah. That's had 20,000 views. Yo. I don't think your head's allowed to get any bigger. It's ugly enough already. Yo, Tu. Tu, can I talk to you? Yeah. Alone? What are you up to you? Don't you worry about what we're up to. Get home before you get in trouble. Whatever, ball sack. Come, Ceejay. The girls are having a heart-to-heart. Bro, my uncle's place just got raided. I really need your key. What? No. Bro, I just need it for tonight. Then I'll give it straight back. - I could lose my job, man. - I know. I wouldn't ask if this wasn't legit. Tucker's on me hard. So...? Did I help you before? Yeah, but... So two-way street, bro. I'm serious, Tu. I need this. I want it back tomorrow. Tomorrow, first thing. Thanks, man. Yeah, yeah. See you. Nice, Conrad. Jase. Show you how it's done. Keep him in the middle, team! Let's go! Wallin' on it let's take it up a notch. Brant, Andrew.

Brant, that's enough. - All right. - Sophie. No. I got this. Sasha, your turn. Tu, what you got? Top that? What's the holdup? So, won these today. Not really my style. What are you on about? These kicks are choice. Turns out you have some tricks. A couple. I seen you guys jam before. Didn't know you could dance like that. Well, ballet really isn't Kane's thing. Probably 'cause he can't lift his leg up that high. True. But he does know how to win championships. Anyway, I'm out. A'ight. Check you out, girl. See you next week? A'ight. Out of the trenches! Son. Let me see your war face! Outside for stretches! Move it, move it, move it! I got the new world in my view. On my journey I pursue I'm running. Running for the city I got the new world in my view. They ain't got muscle, no hustle. No backbone, I stand alone. Not trippin', just sayin' I'm different. Ain't hangin' on to the coattails of the next man. Passport in my left hand. Thinkin' that you are next. Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man. 'Cause I'm out here. Boom, boom. Ain't had this much drive since my Honda civic got rusty. You should leave. See ya. Run it again. Spoiled it on me like Willie beanie. Sip it for me like cappuccino Instagram and tuxedos with my peoples. We growin' up. Still the scene of us slowin' up. Tense wall we throwin' up. Every time, we be showin' up. Get it while I'm livin' Up, up, up. See them? So I'm 'bout my business. And I'm runnin', I'm runnin' I'm runnin' with them now. They don't wanna give it up. We gonna make it out. Hey. I'm almost done. I promise. You're breaking in? - No, I. - I got a key. I got once cut. So you involve me in this bullshit now. - No. - No, no, no, no. I can't believe you! Piss off, Benjy! Get that shit out of here. I've been. Feelin' a little lonely. Okay, stop playing around. Not until you teach me some of your fancy moves. Okay, you're not taking it seriously. Excuse me? I'm trying to broaden my dance horizons, a'ight? Okay. I see you inside my daydreams. Do you want to try some lifts? Sure. Okay. I'm gonna run to you. Turn around. Face this way. Okay. I'm gonna run, put my leg here, and you're gonna wrap your arm around my body, and you're gonna flip me over your shoulder. This shoulder? Like superman. - Like superman? - Yeah. - Use those muscles. - Yo. - Okay, ready? Try it slow. - Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, grab, pull forward. So... not there! No, okay. Again? Yeah, yeah, okay. You want to try running into it? - Sure. - Okay. Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4, lift. So close. What do you mean, close? That was it. No, hold up. Let's dance. Pardon me. It's no surprise. That we ain't in heaven. We're on the earth. But you. You meet me in my darkest cavern. Can't count what you are worth. 'Cause, baby, when the waves crash over me. And, baby, when the skies turn crazy. You're the only one I want next to me. Me. With every passin' second, every drop of fallin' rain I realize I'm lucky to be holding you. When my ground starts shakin' and my bones start breakin' I realize I'm lucky to be holdin' you. We ain't in a perfect world. But you still bring the stars out I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? Sasha was just teaching me some lifts. True? How nice of you to help our guest, Sasha. Hey, ladies. Is that us? - No, thanks. - No, thanks. Sweet. Up to you. We're going for a feed. Burger time. - Bro, they so want this. - You've got issues. - Is everything all right at home? - You know you want this, too. And that's why you're single. Aw, stop. Tu, is that us? Sure. Madison kept stepping on me. She's just not used to dancing with hobbits. - Shut up. - Nah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So, do you guys, like, go out or something? No. She's my sister. - Shane. - Don't worry, "G." I used to think they were dating, too. Bro, I thought she was totally out of your league. Can you not be awkward? Hey, 'cause you're pretty all right. No, really. Just stop. So, how'd it go with brant? It was tough, man. I mean, I hit him with my best stuff, but if I couldn't make it look K-crew, then he doesn't want to know about it. I mean, you're the îsh and everybody knows it. And if we can't dance like them, then chk, chk, chk, chk... Get the K-crew cut. I'm not a stalker or anything. I just saw the lights on. It's all good. Working on something new? No, just conditioning. Hey, we all good earlier? I hope I didn't get you in trouble with... No, no. It's totally my fault. Kane doesn't really like us messing around during rehearsals. It's all right to have a little bit of fun. Yeah. You hungry? Starving. Welcome to my home. Far out. You sure your olds won't be mad I'm here? No. Dad's in China for business, and mom still lives in New York. So you got this whole place to yourself. Pretty much. I hope quinoa salad's okay. Sounds good. How is it? Yum. You liar. Hey, can I ask you something? Sure. Do you ever ask yourself if it's worth it? If what's worth it? All the things that we do to win, to be the best. Of course it's worth it. Why? 'Cause dance is everything. To dance with the best. Man, I'd do anything to be in K-crew with you. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'd be living the dream. I don't know about dream. Hey, beats joining the army. The army? Dad's thing. Family tradition. Sucks. And your mom? She's not around anymore. This your mom? She's the real deal. Yeah, well, she's only agreed to this whole hip-hop phase 'cause K-crew's doing so well. Second we stop winning... You sure I can't take you home? Yeah. 'Cause you're driving all wrong for a 'cuda. Really? Yep. You got to roll the windows down. - Check. - And you got to ride low. Like this? No. Like this. And you got to turn the music up. What's up? Don't judge me. You got to pump it. I wouldn't want to embarrass you. I don't know anybody around here. Turn it up, turn it up. That somebody loves you. Somebody thinks you got a halo above you. He thinks you're wonderful. He thinks you're beautiful. In everything you do. Somebody loves you. He wants to tell you every time you're near. We can't. Somebody loves you. Somebody loves you. He's right here I know. Auger broke. I opened it up and already clocked you in. Move your ass! Thanks. I won't be long. Hey, sorry about last night. We're gonna be late. How we all feeling? Hey, congrats on making it this far. But this is just the beginning. We're going up a level. We're doing three days a week. - Sweet? - Yeah. Pair up. Tu, you're with me. I just want you to be honest with me. What's up? Are you still serious about being in my crew? Of course I am. Then, why are you holding back? Well, most of my moves aren't your style. True. Your moves are messy as hell. I could fix it. It just looks like you don't want to dance with us. - What? No. I do. - I get it. You see my nice ride, my private studio. You think I come from money? Bro, I come from pommy, straight-up ghetto trash. I know what it's like to come from nothing. Everything I have now I got from dancing. And I got it 'cause I'm all-in. - So what if I go all. - In but it's not enough? That's on you. But if you don't go all-in, I'll cut you... tonight. Tu, you're a solid dancer, and I really want you to make it into K-crew. - Tell me what to do, then. - Bring your "a" game. So when do we start? Hey. What did he say? Well, what did you guys do? - You're so his favorite. - You're so his favorite. - Clue us up. - Clue us up. Whoa, sis. Let the man breathe. No, but honest, what did Kane want? Nothing. He just wanted to talk. So you guys just talked? - Jammed a little set. - Hey! - What? - So he danced with you? He wants me to come up with a K-crew style set - and show him next time. - Sweet! So at least one of us is in. The way I see it, the best dancers they could pick are standing right here. That's right! - Yo! - Yo! - K-crew! - K-crew! She must be some girl to have you dancing in the street. You're out late. I got the scholarship. Straight up? - For real? - For real. I'm going to uni. That's mean, Von! - Yeah? - Hell yeah! I always knew you'd crack it. Yeah, I know you did. And you never listen to me. Yeah, 'cause most of what you say is stupid. You know that means I'll have to leave the crew when school starts. You'll be around for regionals. Yeah, but after that... I'm gonna tell the crew at practice tomorrow. Go to bed, loser. Whatever. You're the one hanging around like a creep. Creep? Aw, shut up. 'Night. You're home late. Again. Where've you been? Was out with the boys. You know, living it up before I get shipped away. Well, you kids have got to grow up someday? Yep. Get some sleep. We're up in four hours. Any luck hooking some shore honeys? Bro, you can't stay angry at me forever. I've got to go. You holding, G? Hey. Take one. - How much? - Just $20. Sweet. Got any mates? Yep. Got some mates downtown who might want to have a word with you. Aw, shit! Hey! Against the wall! Get off me! Benjy tuhoro, you're under arrest! Love you! Whoo! Hey, look at him. - Love you! - Yeah, boy! I'm gonna go. All right. See you later, all right? Bye. Bye, babe. Hey. Twins all good? Gadarthy got cut. Bro, it could be any one of us next. You look terrible. Bro, I can't even. What is it? What's up? It's just a lot of pressure, I need to get into K-crew. If it's too far from karae, you should just stay up here. We have a spare room. All good, bro. I got to get home, got to keep my old man happy, keep my boss happy, keep my crew happy. You still jam with 2pk? Well, I didn't know if this was gonna be locked down. And I didn't want to piss them off over nothing. All of us left our crews. This is Kane's national team. I know, man. And it's only Tuesday. It's Wednesday. Man, I've got to go. - See you tomorrow. - If Vonnie hasn't killed me! Von. Sorry. I got mixed up. I'm coming now. Practice is canceled anyway. That's why I was trying to call you. What? Why? Benjy got arrested. We're at the warehouse. Hurry up. What's the haps, man? What are you on about? You, being late for practice. You were a no-show today. I've been working, man. Ceejay said that you've been leaving early for weeks. Bro, regionals are almost here, and you're blowing... Blowing us off for some girl on the north shore! I thought this crew meant more to you than that. Bro, not even. Then what? I've been... trying out... For K-crew. - What?! - K-crew?! - Hey! Hey! - Chill! Chill! Chill! - "G." - "G," get off me, man! I still want to dance with you if I don't make it! What?! So we're you're second choice? - No. - Your side crew, is it? - I just... - Just what?! I'm nearly there! I only have to make it through one more practice without getting cut! So we're just supposed to wait? Bro, who do you think you are? Like, honestly. Benjy's out, and you think you can just waste our time like that? You have to choose. Vonnie... you guys are my crew. So you choose us? No. Tu, don't you dare leave us like that. - What do you want from me?! - Why didn't you tell me? 'Cause you'd have talked me out of it! What? I'm not like you, okay? I'm not smart. I'm not going to uni! So, yeah, I saw a chance to make something good of myself, - and I took it! - Then why didn't you just leave? Why lie to us, make up some girl on the shore? I didn't make her up! It's hard to explain. What do you even care? You're gone soon, anyway. 'Cause I was gonna leave you in charge of the crew, and I thought you gave a damn about us. Hey! What're you doing here? Coming to work. You don't work here anymore. You're fired. Give me your key. Benjy said he stole your key, copied it, swore you weren't involved. Is that true? Whatever it is you're doing... Hope it's worth it. All right, listen up. Today's your last chance. Show me how much you want this. Pair up. Sasha, pair up. You know, if I make it, you have to start talking to me again. Let's just dance. 5, 6, 7... - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Then why are you making me look bad? Today's my last chance! Tu, this is just a friggin' dance crew. For you, maybe! My whole life depends on this! - Tu, I'm so sorry. - No. Can I get another partner, please? Run it from the top. 5, 6... How are things at work? It's too hard to say. You know, same stuff every day. You think I don't know what a lie looks like, boy? - What? - Sarge... So you know nothing about all that dope the cops found at your work, then? I'm not doing any of that stuff. Straight up. I was on the shore all day. - Out there dealing? - What? No. Just... give it to me straight. Tu kaea, what have you been doing, son? Dancing. I'm one of the final five in tryouts to join the best hip-hop crew in New Zealand. You're joking, right? This is it for me. This is my break. And what happens if they don't take you? What are your plans, son? They'll take me, dad. They'll take me. Move it. It's good. From the top. All I can say is that this is a really hard decision. You're all mean dancers, but K-crew can't take you all. When I call your name, come up. Sasha. Brent. Madison. Sophie. Conrad. Jules. That leaves one more, right? Andrew. Congrats, guys. Everyone else... Wait. That's just last year's crew. Yeah, it is. Thanks. You can go. Tu! Tu, wait! What was that?! What were you guys doing in there? All I saw were you guys doing my set, my moves. Well, technically, they're our moves now. - What?! - Tu! - Stop! Hey! Wait! - We were never going to get in. They just wanted to steal our sets. I'm a winner. I win at all costs. Something you should learn. Babe, let's go. Be right there. Later, freaks. How long did you know? - Tu... - How long? I didn't mean for any of this to happen, but... But what? You were having too much fun in your flash car and your flash bloody mansion, laughing with your stuck-up mates about how you would trick... You tricked me. That's not fair. You tricked me into thinking I had a chance. No, I just... I have to figure some things out, okay? It's too late for that. Yo. Hey. You surprised me. Just came to check on my girl. Hey, what's wrong? What are we doing? What it takes. It's wrong. This is so wrong, Kane. Are you questioning how I run my crew? - No, I just... - You just... what? Think you could do a better job? I didn't say that. I took a huge risk letting you in my crew. You had no hip-hop experience, no rep, no chance. But now look at you. People know your name, girls want to be you, guys want to date you. I made you a winner. Now, we both know what happens when you stop winning, right? You go home. I don't want you to go home. Do you? No. Then be a good girl. Keep winning. Hey, loser. What do you want? I didn't make it? It was all a lie. They lied to me. To bite our moves. Forget it. Have fun at uni! Tu. Bro, drop the act and harden up. So you didn't get asked to dance with some rich kids from the shore. They were my only shot! No, no, no, no, no. Bro, you're all wrong. Look at me. You are your shot. You don't need them. They needed you. If they're so stale they've got to bite other people's moves, they already know they're on the way out. But you? Tu, you got nowhere to go but up. - Thanks, Von. - Whatevs. Just remember Benjy's in jail for being even more of a loser than you are. Go and see him, loser. It's not that bad. Great TV. Whatever. I'm out on probation in a week. I ain't never coming back here. Thanks for not narcing on me. Bro, I put myself in here. And what am I gonna do? Bring you down with me? We're all looking for a way up, cuz. I just looked in the wrong place. Yeah, me too. Bro, you're a mean dancer. K-crew didn't think so. Hey, k-crew know you're one of the best dancers in the city. That's why they scammed you all in the first place. Benjy, you're a genius! Thanks, bro! What did I say? - Hey. - Yo, what's up? - How are you? - Good.

To the freaks, the freaks, freaks! Of course, K-crew... Yeah! They're off for the nationals once again. We cruisin', we rollin' But when we hit the scene, Best believe we gonna go it.

They're gonna be at nationals. They're nothing. Back to work. He's not home. Excuse me? It's Sasha, right? You must be Vonnie. Yeah, and you must be dumb if you think Tu wants to see you after what you did to him. Look, I know you guys are close. He's my best friend. You used him, you lied to him, and you stole from him. I know what I did was wrong. But I really do care about Tu. Funny way of showing it. Is he okay? He's tough. He's always gonna be okay. Look, if you really care about Tu, then leave him alone and let him focus on nationals tomorrow. Can you just please tell him that I was here? Yeah, whatever. Who's that? Just somebody after Tu. What's the boy done now? Don't tell me it's this dance rubbish, either. Don't you know? Know what? What's this? Your son. He's hit over 800,000 views. What's up, bitches? Look what you did. Von!

Then take K-crew down. Easy as. "Easy as"? Stolen moves aside, K-crew's last hit was fire, and they just came on top. Forget them. This isn't about them.
