IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE produced by Jeonwonsa Lee Hyeyoung Cho Yunhee Kwon Haehyo Shin Seokho Kim Saebyeok Ha Seungguk Seo Younghwa Lee Eunmi Kang Yiseo production manager Kim Minhee production assistant Lee Soyoung sound Seo Jihoon written and directed by Hong Sangsoo Everything I see before me is grace. There is no tomorrow. No yesterday, no tomorrow. But this moment right now is paradise. It can be paradise. Long time no see! Yeah. You don't look very excited to see me. Well, I'm not that excited. I saw you last night. You had coffee? Tell me. Did you always joke around like that? No, I'm just sleepy. - Slept well? - I did. But I had a dream. A good one. What dream? I can't tell you. You can't talk about good dreams until noon. So they say. - They say that? - Yeah. - Just tell me about it. - No, I can't tell you. But I think it's a good omen. It was really unusual. - Do you dream often? - Yeah. I should buy a lottery ticket today. The dream was really strange. - You'll buy a lottery ticket? - Sure! Who knows? I sure don't know. Since you won't tell me. I'll tell you later. Should we go out for breakfast? Coffee and toast? I know a good place. Shall we? But will it be open? Yeah, it opens at 9. Our timing's perfect. Wait, you had an appointment today. When is it? It's a late lunch, but... Should I skip it? You should go, of course. So after breakfast, you can go there directly. That cafe is really crowded. But if we go now, it'll be perfect. Yeah, I feel like toast for breakfast. - I've had plenty of rice. - Yes, you have. I ate like a pig, my belly's sticking out. Don't be ridiculous! You should eat more. You think? Yeah! You're too thin. You look sick. You really look sick. I see. What are you doing? Time to go out. Get dressed. Okay. Thank you. For this peace, and sparing me pain. I'll go eat something nice and have a good day. Thank you. This coffee is great. It's delicious. Really? I'm glad. Of all the coffee I've had here, this is the best. This cafe is really great. Isn't it? Let's come here often. It's nice, right? - Shall we? - Yeah. It's so peaceful. I wish you lived in Korea. Just buy an apartment and stay here. Why live in the US all on your own? That would be nice. They're building some new apartments. Construction's almost done. It'd be great if you lived here. You could come to this cafe, walk along the river each morning. That'd be so nice. I bought my place through the apartment lottery, but this area suits me better. Eventually I'll end up out here. That'd be nice, living near here. How about going to see that apartment? - Now? - It's right here. Didn't you say it was under construction? Yeah, but you can look at the outside. Get a feeling for it. Let's go. After you finish the coffee. Okay. So, it's just looking from the outside, right? And we'll walk in the park next to it. I should've moved to a place like this. But I was so lucky to get chosen in that apartment lottery. - So you were lucky. - Yes. The value's gone up 200 million won since then. That much? When did you move in? A year and a half ago? Sis, move back here. Don't you have 200 million? If so, borrow another 200 million and buy an apartment. 200 million... $200,000... You have that much, right? You must have a house there. No, I've always paid rent. I have no savings. That's how everyone lives there. But it seems people here have a lot of money. You have no savings? Well, a little. Extremely little. From $200,000, take away two zeroes. Then what was your job? In DC, you worked in a travel agency. I had... What's it called? Liquor store... A store that sells alcohol. Now it's up for sale. Really? You sold alcohol? I see... I didn't serve alcohol. It wasn't a bar. I sold bottles of alcohol. A retail store. After moving to Seattle, I looked for an easy way to earn money, and that was it. If you get regular customers, it's easy. I had a lot. Really? I really had no idea. Sis, it's shameful. Look at the two of us. You're my only sibling, my one sister. But we have no idea how the other has lived. Do you know how I've lived? Well, we haven't been in contact. And you didn't answer my letter. When did I not answer? - When you left for the US? - That time, and a few others. I don't know what you're saying. You left. And we stayed. Do you know how I felt then? Can't you understand? It really upset me. You taking off like that. Running off with some guy you barely knew. You exaggerate. I came back several times. Up until Mom died. Why did you come this time? I was so shocked when you called. I told you. - Really? - What? I just came. I wanted to see you, and Seungwon. And I've somewhere to go. You wanted to see Seungwon? I missed him a lot. I think of him often. I'm thankful for that. Of course I miss him, he's my only nephew. - He was such a beautiful child. - Right. Anyway, his rice cake shop is doing very well. Lots of customers, sales are good. That's great. I'm really glad. - He really liked you. - Did he? Wow, isn't this pretty? Yes, they're in full bloom. They are. Right, you always liked flowers. Me? No, I didn't. But as I get older, I like them more. I like them, too. Nature is amazing. Hey, let's take a photo! - A selfie? - Come here. Will we fit in the frame? Of course. My arm is so long. - Look here. - Right. That was a joke. No, that's awful. Let's do it again. My arm's too short. My face comes out too big. How can I do this? I'm sorry, would you mind taking a photo of us? Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Here. - Thank you. - It's nothing. - It came out well. - It's nice! By any chance, are you an actor? I think I saw you on TV. Yes, that's right. Though not anymore. Not anymore? A long time ago. I acted then, but not now. I see. You're so lovely. You must be older than me, but you're lovely. You took care of yourself. Thank you. It must be the alcohol. What? - I don't exercise. - Really? I don't do anything. Is it true? That's amazing. You look like you do. She was born that way. Her figure, her skin... - She should thank Mom and Dad. - Yes, she should. If you start acting again, I'll definitely watch. - It's great to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Have a nice day. Goodbye. - Have a good day! - Thank you. - Let's go. - Goodbye. - Look, a bee! - Where? You appeared on TV only once, how'd she recognize you? You were thinking of that? Yeah. You were on so briefly, and it was an old photo. She recognized you from that? Amazing. Yes, amazing. She has sharp eyes. She seemed like a good person. People watch a lot of TV, I guess. I'm glad I didn't do that other thing. But you might still act, right? Isn't your meeting today about that? So you know. It'd be good for you to act again. It'd be fun. I don't know. It'd be nice. It could be fun. I think you'd have fun. Doing something you like, and earning money! It'll be great for you. There's a railroad bridge? - Oh, that bridge? - Looks old. Yeah, it's really old. Trains don't run on it now. It's a bicycle path. A tourist course. Want to go see? No, I hate heights. I can't go up anyplace high. A phobia, you mean? I can't even go near the window in your home. Really? It must be hard for you. Are you okay staying there? It's fine, it's just a short time. I just avoid the window. There's so much we don't know about each other, right? Yes. Even after growing up together. Wait, your dream! You still can't tell me? Not yet. Only after 12:00. It's so cool, clear, and beautiful here. With every step I take on this earth, let me accept things as You give them. Save me from fears about the future, and keep me in the present. Let me stay here in the present. - No need to hurry. - Okay. - There's a school here? - Yeah, lots of student customers. But it's mostly deliveries. Especially now. Delivery is so developed here. - Good afternoon! - Hi. You came quickly. - He went home. - What? Hello! Why'd he go home? I don't know. He said he'd be back soon. - He's not on delivery? - No, he went home. The owner does deliveries? If there are a lot of orders. - He has to pay for each delivery. - I see. This is his girlfriend. She's nice. - This is Seungwon's aunt. - Nice to meet you. They look similar, don't you think? They look completely different to me. Really? We won't stay long. Just stopping by. He rushed out just after you called. - Something to drink? - Sure. Shall we have something cool? Soda? Sit down here. Give him a call, see where he is. He left his phone. Oh my. - He won't be long, it's not far. - Sure. Have you got time? - Want to try some tteok-bokki? - Tteok-bokki? It's a lunch appointment. Is it spicy? A little, but it's good. Made with broth. Give it a try. It's really spicy? - A bit? I like it. - Okay. Could you make us some tteok-bokki? - Sure. - Just a little. - She has a lunch appointment. - Yes, coming right up. She brought two cans! So refreshing. What? Did you spill? - Did you spill a lot? - Just a little. - I'll need water or a wet nap. - Just a minute. - Can you bring us a wet nap? - Yes. Or just run a cloth under water. - Something clean. - Yes. I doubt that will come out. Maybe you better go change clothes at home. - Should I? - I don't think that will come out. - Let's go. - Okay. You're going? Thanks, I'll come again. - We'll see Seungwon later. - Yes, for sure. - Bye. - Goodbye. See you. - Watch over the shop. - All right. Mom! There you are. You're leaving? - Hello. - She has an appointment. We stopped in to see the shop. Really? - You stained your clothes? - No, it's fine. Just a small spot. Really? Since you came, I should have treated you. I have a lunch appointment. I'll come again soon. Take this. I bought it before, but it's new. A gift? It's nothing big. I just thought it would suit you. Take it when you go traveling. Can I open it? I'm going to open it! Sorry to give it to you here. That doesn't matter. How does it open? Like this. It's pretty. A wallet? It's so cute. You like it? - There's money inside. - Right. What's this? I put in $100 to make you feel good. That's so cute. - Thank you, really. - It's nothing. Doesn't this leather look nice? Sure, it looks really nice. Lucky you. - I'll give you a gift later. - All right. You'll be in Korea for a while? Sure, I'll be around. Then see you next time. - I left the shop empty. - Sure, go on back. - Thanks for the gift. - It's nothing. - Goodbye, Auntie. - Seungwon. - See you again soon. - Bye. Bye, son. Let's go. I'll just go there directly. It's a bother to stop at home. And why should I change my clothes for him? Really? You sure? You can't even see it. I never worried about such things in America. What difference does it make? You're right. No one will notice, unless they stare at it. Right! Just flag a taxi for me. I'll go now. Okay then. - Hey... - What? What a sweet present, right? It was, wasn't it? - Right? - Yeah. But I can take you there in my car. No need for that. Don't bother. Where can I get a taxi? Right up here. Thank You. I'm grateful for his generosity to give me this wallet. Help me to be the kind of person to deserve such generosity. And help me to stay vigilant at this meeting. I'll stay vigilant. This is Song Jaewon. The raw fish restaurant I reserved isn't answering. So instead, I made a reservation at 'Novel' in Insa-dong. The owner will open it at 3:30. If it's okay with you, let's meet there. The address is Insa-dong 4-gil 12-4. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please confirm. Sorry, but can I change my destination? Where do you want to go? To Itaewon. Okay. Where in Itaewon? - I'll tell you when we get there. - Okay. How far is Insa-dong from Itaewon? To Insa-dong? - 15-20 minutes without traffic. - Thank you. Hello? Oh, hello. Can I help you? No, I just stopped in. Is it okay to look around? Looks like a flower shop. - Yes, it's fine. - Thank you. We sell clothes and other things. Take a look inside. I see. You didn't know this shop? I used to live here. Very long ago. So I stopped by just in case. The house is still here. You live here? Yes, my mother lived here, then we remodeled it. I see. But the yard is the same. It's amazing. I remember being here. In that corner. - You came from abroad? - How did you know? - You said it was a long time ago. - Yes. Want to come inside? Or do you prefer it here? Sorry to impose, dropping in like this. Not at all. I'm glad you came. I'm surprised to meet someone who lived here. Yes. Stay for a while. I'll bring you something to drink. No, I'm fine. Please stay. We have delicious plum tea. - Here you are. It's tasty. - Thank you. It really is good. It's so nice meeting someone who lived here. Was it long ago? A very long time ago. When I was this big. So you live here too? No, we live quite far away. Incheon. - That is really far! - Yes. We suddenly got an apartment there. - I see. - Yes. I see an ashtray there, can I smoke? You'd like a cigarette? Yes, go ahead. Thank you. I smoke here, too. I'll take one. This yard is so nice. But it's so small. Long ago, it seemed really big. I really like this yard, too. Yes, the yard... Okay, first choice is pork cutlet. Pork! Second choice, pasta. - Pork! - Pasta! - Pasta? - Pasta! - Pork or pasta? - I want pasta! Let's do rock scissors paper. Rock scissors paper! Then it's pork. - No! - No? But you lost. One more time. Once more? Shall we? Rock scissors paper! It can't be helped. Then tomorrow! Okay, pork today, and pasta tomorrow. The memories in my heart are so heavy. I don't know why I came here. It was wrong of me. I won't live this way. Let me see what is in front of my face. - What's your name? - Suh Jieun. - How old are you? - Six. - You live in Incheon? - Yes. Then you came here to visit? No, this is our home. You have a home in Incheon, too? No, this is our home. I see. - Good girl. - Thank you. Jieun. Come here. What a good girl. You're a good girl. Here you are. Is coffee okay? Yes, thank you. I thought we'd have lunch, but it's a bar. You were expecting lunch? What to do? There's a Chinese restaurant nearby. Shall we order from there? It's quite good. - Really? - Yes. Sorry, since we changed the time, I thought you'd eat first. I see. But I'm not hungry. Shall I bring the menu? - Yes, would you? - Sure. I apologize. Changing the time like that. No, it's fine. But this place is nice. A very cute bar. It's cozy. Glad you like it. But were you thinking we'd drink? In the afternoon? No, eat now, and we'll drink later if you want. I just thought it'd be comfortable here. It is. You come here often? No, but if I'm in the area, I drop by. - It's an interesting name. - Yes. "Novel" Your films are like novels. Short stories. - You watched my films? - Of course. I searched them out after you called. I thought I should! Thank you. They were very nice. Like short stories. Really? - Anyway, we've finally met. - Yes. What took you so long? - The owner stepped out. - Really? Please choose. - What'll you have? - Anything is fine. Really? The deep fried shrimp and sweet &amp; sour pork are good here. No meaty smell. Since I'm not that hungry, order what you want. Shall we? Then, deep fried shrimp? And sweet &amp; sour pork. Any rice dish? This should be enough. Order one if you want. - Any rice for you? - It's plenty already. - Right? Then order what you want. - All right. Any alcohol? Chinese liquor? Not something from here? Sure. Chinese liquor for Chinese food. Two bottles? All right. I'm happy. About what? - Just happy to see you. - I'm happy, too. You declined at first, so I'm grateful you met me. - I wanted to see you. - I wanted to see you too. I was curious. Why you are so interested in someone like me. Ah, that? Remember a scene you shot with Lee Seongsoo in the early 90s? Sitting on a bench, taking in all the desolation of winter. And the moment you stared at the pigeons. I remember it so vividly. You stretched your hand out to the pigeons. Your face then... It was like a blessing. It was so amazing. I saw it as a university freshman. It felt so fresh, and so beautiful. That film engraved itself in my heart. Thank you so much. And just a year later, in the spring of 1991... What was that actor's name? It doesn't matter. That scene with him in a taxi. In that vibrant yellow-green dress, your face staring at the falling white snow, I remember it all. It was an honesty I'd never seen on screen. I felt a true authenticity behind your purity. You know how much I stared at your face in that poster? You are really something. That was so long ago. No, for me it was truly memorable. Thank you so much for remembering that. I'm really happy to meet you now. Did I tell you already? - I'm glad to meet you. - You did. Novel Where is the owner? She left me the key. I'll lock up on the way out. - She doesn't do business? - No customers these days. She's going somewhere today. Tongyeong, maybe? I guess she trusts you. I've known her a long time. I'd like to meet her sometime. She seems to have faith in people. She's a good person. And a great singer. Come meet her next time. That's why there's a guitar. - You play guitar? - No. I studied a little, but I quit. Really? Then play something. Just a second. Why'd you send your assistant away? He wanted to stay. It's not that. He had work at the office. No, he said you told him to leave. Well, it's your business. But did you have any particular inspiration for making a film with me? I mean, I'm old now. - I'm all wrinkled. - No, you're not at all. I'm not sure. But I feel like I should make a film with you. No particular inspiration. It's just that I believe in your soul. I want to create a character that has your strength and light. I'll write a good story to bring out that character. How long will it take? A first draft usually takes 6 months to a year. If we hurry, 3 months? I think it's possible. Is it because of your return to the US? So filmmaking takes longer these days… If you agree to do it, you can go to the US while I write, and come back for shooting. You know... I don't think I can. It's a real pity. You seem like a good person. But I'm sorry, I can't. I see. Is it the schedule? If so, we can... I have no time. It's a bit awkward to say this, but I don't have long to live. What? Are you okay? Maybe I shouldn't have told you. Is it true? It is. I won't live long. This is a secret. Just between you and me. It's really true? Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. They say I have 5-6 months. If the doctors say it, it must be true. I'll just be happy with that much time. At least that much. But you don't look sick. - Really? - You don't. I see. Actually, I'm not in pain. Thankfully. I guess it will hurt later. This is really hard. What do we do? I won't go to the hospital. I'll continue my life at home. If there's work, I'll do it. I'll go out. Later if I feel sick I'll take painkillers. I'll endure it... and then die. Yeah. That's why I met you. If it's possible, to take part. Or to help if I can. That's why I came. Another glass? Fuck, life really sucks... Don't speak that way. It's nice here. What can we do? Where are you going? Give me a cigarette. Say something. What's with this rain? Right, the weather is so strange. - Are you cold? - A little, but I'm fine. - Should I turn on the heat? - No, it won't be long. When is your assistant coming? Soon. I think he's caught in traffic. Have another? Let's drink to the death. Yes. Are you scared of dying? Aren't you sad? Do I have to be sad? I have this strange sort of belief. I believe heaven is hiding in front of our faces. Really? In front of our faces? I decided to die once when I was 17. I had a different reason then. Have you ever? No, not yet. We're different, sure enough. I went out to die, and passed by Seoul Station. The faces of the people in the plaza suddenly looked so beautiful. I had absolutely made up my mind to die, but for the first time ever, I saw how incredibly beautiful the world is. A man walked by with a filthy, greasy face, but his face was amazingly beautiful. So beautiful I could have licked it. Really! Is that so? But I wasn't just being emotional in the face of death. I felt in my heart what reality was. I saw things properly, as they really are. - Really? - Yes. After that I just forgot about it. For a very long time. But it came to mind again recently. Luckily. It is lucky. If I can just properly see what's before my face, I'm not afraid of anything. Truly. Everything is before me. All complete. Nothing to add or take away. Perfectly complete. It's just grace. That's a relief. You don't understand me? I'm relieved, anyway. From the moment I felt it, I don't fear anything, and I'm much freer. I've never felt that myself, but I'm curious. You've been blessed. I think you're so pure-hearted, you've been blessed. You think so? - Yes. - Thank you. How about making a short film? That would be nice. - A short film? - Yes. When? Well, tomorrow even. I just want to capture you on film somehow. I'd like to shoot you. How about just traveling for a couple days and shooting? Sure, let's do that. Really? We can shoot with my camera, and edit on my computer. - You have a camera? - Yes. You operate a camera, too. I always carry it with me. We can edit it there, and watch the finished film. That's really great. Then where?… We'll go tomorrow? Yes, we'll go tomorrow. Where should we go? Where do you want? Anywhere is fine. There must be some place you want to go. Me? Well… Tongyeong is nice. - Or Yangyang. - Yangyang? Yes, in Kangwon Province. - Kangwon Province... - Yes. That's a pretty name. Yangyang. It's really nice there. This time of year, it's beautiful. - Must be nice. - Yes. For real, tomorrow? Yes, shall I pick you up in the morning? - Very well. - Okay then. Tell me... - Are you married? - Yes. I see. - Any children? - One son, all grown up. A happy family? I wish him the best. So you have a son. It'll be nice to go traveling tomorrow. Yes. You want to sleep with me, don't you? Yes. I see. If you don't mind. I know. Thank you. Thank you, too. Are you all right? Sure, thanks for coming. - Sorry, was it hard getting here? - Not at all. Are you okay? Of course. - But you'll have to drive. - Sure, give me the keys. Right, it's in the parking lot. - You're both okay? - Yeah. - Then shall I bring the car? - Would you? I'll lock up. - Want me to lock up? - No, I can do it. Do you have an umbrella? - Use that one. - What about you? Okay, thank you. - I'll wait for you. - We'll be out soon. Shouldn't we clean up here? Just leave it. I'll call later and apologize. Why? Should I clean up? - You stay seated. - No, I'll help. No, it's fine. I'll do a rough cleanup. If you're going to clean up, do it properly. You think? Very well. All right, let's go. - What a cute lock. - Isn't it? - I enjoyed this place. - Yes. Just a minute. Want to smoke? This is Song Jaewon. I wasn't sure whether our promise yesterday was realistic, or a byproduct of the alcohol. Forgive me. What I promised yesterday can never happen. Thank you so much for opening your heart yesterday. I wish you happiness, with all my heart. This is Song Jaewon.
