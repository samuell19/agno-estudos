NARITA FEBRUARY 24TH, 1971 This is the broadcast front. The Sanrizuka-Shibayama Anti-Airport League. You, Airport Corporation, you must give nature back to Sanrizuka... Must give Sanrizuka back to the nature to which it always belonged. Throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa... Nature is being destroyed, humanity is being crushed... and sacrifices are forced on peasants, workers... and the others who are struggling. Do you know the fact? THE PEASANTS OF THE SECOND FORTRESS HOW TO DEFEND THE FORTRESS We shall decide ourselves... whether to abandon our trees or to stay in our tunnels. We are all full of fight. The most important thing is to stay in the tunnels... then to defend our trees and fortresses. The tunnel will be our last fortress. Trees come first. Trees are the most important. Women will defend the trees. One tree to every woman. The tunnels will be our last fortress. To go in the tunnels is the last thing of all. Let's defend the barricade to the very last. No matter how, we must have enough time to defend. We are lost if this fortress is taken. Let's defend it to the last. If they bring a crane truck, I'll hang on to it. We must chain ourselves to the trees. Then they won't dare attack. And meanwhile, we'll have time to return to our posts and our tunnel. I think we can get in the tunnel easily... in only a few minutes. We may be arrested, or we may be wounded. We are ready. While the enemy is attacking the fortress... We can leave the tunnel and fight outside. Let's fight here, I think that's best. I agree... strategically that's good. If we chain ourselves to the barricade, they'd be helpless. I'll go on the top of the barricade. When the enemy gets in, let's lock our chains. The best attitude is: "Come who dares to come!" How about trees? Should one chain oneself to them? Wire is better. Mother Yanagawa, you must choose a big tree. You are fat. We'll see how much of me they can drag... I'm 80kg. You climb up this tree. You might break your neck. I don't care. You will survive me. I'll be at the barricade today. It has a good view and it is fun. It's dangerous if you slip. Let's ask the old man what he thinks. After all, I think the tunnel is most important. But we shouldn't go in the tunnel while we're fighting here. We'll rush into the tunnel at the last moment. We should be prepared so that we can chain ourselves quickly. If the enemy attacks the fortress... those who are inside will all fight back. At the same time, everybody must be prepared to... go to his post and chain himself. We must climb the trees just before they attack. Otherwise we won't be able to. If they come to pull you down, fight them off. We're staking our life here, up to the last moment... When they're trying to destroy the fortress. Naturally, we ought to use the spears. PEASANTS' BROADCASTING TOWER RESISTING EXPROPRIATION IN THE NAME OF JAPANESE PEASANTS GROUND IN FRONT OF THE 2ND FORTRESS Smash the airport! Defend the tunnel! Smash the airport! ZENGAKUREN DISPOSITION OF PEASANTS IS BEING DECIDED 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25... 26 members. Who'll go in the tunnel? 7 members to the death patrol - to the tunnel. 18 remain. About half of them will chain themselves to the trees. The tunnel men will fight here until the signal of withdrawal. Everybody to his post! You don't have to climb the trees. You remain under your trees. Everyone to his post! To his tree! Use as big a tree as possible. BAMBOO SPEARS Everyone to his post. Don't wander around. Take them and assign them one by one to the trees. THE FORTRESS IS REINFORCED DAY BY DAY AT 10 A.M.... THE PERSONNEL OF THE NEW TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORPORATION APPEAR ON THE SCENE ESCORTED BY RIOT POLICE They might throw stones at us. They might kill us. Doesn't matter how you look! Put this on if you want to live that much. You can have it. I'll wear this. If you don't like it, I'll lend you my helmet. It suits you. You prefer the helmet, don't you? Put this cloth inside. A towel is better. BINDING THEMSELVES TO THE TREES WITH CHAINS Is anybody there? CALLING INTO THE TUNNEL Is anybody there? Nobody is there. This is the Peasants' Broadcasting Tower of the Anti-Airport League. Comrades of the Anti-Airport League! The enemy has now made its appearance. Make ready for fight! Turn it a little this way. Can two people go in? This is safer. This is more comfortable. YOU'RE LIKE A PUPPY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER Governor Tomono of Chiba Prefecture may have scruples at... Carrying out such thing... But we peasants will never allow him... To rob us of everything by mere force. They are trying to suppress our struggle. It is obvious that the Airport Corporation has no power... If we are all united. THE FIRST DAY THE CORPORATION PERSONNEL COULD NOT APPROACH THE FORTRESS FEBRUARY 25TH The Government and the Corporation are surrounding us ruthlessly. But we aren't afraid of such oppression. We are now even more eager to fight. And will repulse any kind of oppression by the riot police. AT 9 A.M., RIOT POLICE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE FORTRESS The armed riot police has now arrived just under the Broadcasting Tower. Hey, you cops! Everyone to his post! We'll be alright! Everyone to his post! Today they are sure to attack! They're coming! They're also down there! No. 28! No. 24! The time has come to show our peasants' spirit. Steady on! Be ready to fight! This is the Peasants' Broadcasting Tower of Anti-Airport League... Shall we do it together? Come in. This is the Peasants' Broadcasting Tower. You cops! What are you trying to do here! It's cold. Don't grumble. This is the Peasants' Broadcasting Tower. All those who have gathered here today! The enemy has been driven into a corner. He cannot come without riot police. What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? IN FRONT OF THE BROADCASTING TOWER NEAR THE SECOND FORTRESS ZENGAKUREN SUPPORTERS WOMEN'S ACTION COMMITTEE AT THE 4TH FORTRESS Riot police at the 1st and 2nd fortresses! Retreat at once! RIOT POLICE CONCENTRATES THEIR ATTACK ON SUPPORTING GROUPS MANY PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED AND WOUNDED THE FORTRESS MAY BE DESTROYED AT ANY MOMENT. HOW CAN WE REALLY DEFEND IT? The strategy of the Anti-Airport League is to stand in a row... and protest and to chain ourselves after the barricades are taken down. Then make it a protracted struggle and defend the tunnels. This is the basic strategy of our League. But that means we're not really fighting. This won't be a real battle. If we want to avoid losses... We'd better go out of the barricade and make a human chain. In any case the barricade will be broken. Then we can't make a stand in the tunnels. But it's the League's decision and policy. We can't win that war. The people in the tunnels will be isolated. They wouldn't know what to do. If we are to fight in the tunnels... What should we do outside beforehand? If all we do is to make a human chain... What will happen to those in the tunnels? It would be like the Communist Party. Then, those in the tunnels will come out too. Even a schoolchild wouldn't have had such a bad idea. It's only for show! I don't mind being arrested if we could at least fight. We've done everything till now... We must defend the fortress to the last. We rely on the supporting students for the outer defense. The students will be responsible. We've been fighting together for years. The leaders should think of themselves... rather than worry about the students. Nobody likes to be injured. If you're talking about protracted struggle... Think of those in the tunnels. Next time we'll ask our leaders to stay in the tunnels for 1 or 2 months. We'll bring them food. Let's discuss our strategy, then fight. Let's make an example. Our group can't lose. Let's unify the will of our group... And decide how we'll use the bamboo spears and chains. Struggle is severe! THEY CHAIN THEMSELVES TO THE TREES THEY AGREED AT THIS TIME NOT TO USE BAMBOO SPEARS If the barricade is broken, they'll cut down the trees. They'll announce that they have the land... ...when they've cut down the trees. If the barricade is broken, we are lost. We mustn't let them pull down a single tree... But, even to save the trees... We shouldn't throw stones or use our spears. But chaining ourselves to trees isn't wrong as a principle, is it? They say don't lay too much stress on trees and fortresses... ...but to defend the tunnels first. Aren't we defending the barricades in order to protect the tunnels? That's a difficult point. Of course we want you to stay by the trees with chains... ...and defend them properly. But it's difficult to stake one's life. It can't be solved by the use of arms. We want you to defend them physically. May I express my opinion? We can't look on silently... ...while those chained to the trees are arrested. Then what's the use of carrying spears? Shouldn't we fight to the last? Even if our position is hopeless. We must fight with such a spirit. This time, I understand that you're anxious to use the spears. But it's no use. Even if we had 1.000 spears and guns, we won't be able to win. We'll fight with teeth and nails. That's best! This battle is not very spectacular. That's how battles are. They change according to the situation. We must save our energy for the next battle. As I have always been saying... Even if we use bamboo spears, it doesn't necessarily mean we'll win. But we should at least confront them with a spear, with that spirit... And then be arrested. At least we must have such a determination. We can't, like mere onlookers, leave the chained persons to their fate. Let's be prepared to be arrested one and all... But show them our fighting spirit. We all have the same feeling. Well, I... I think... The most important thing is our attitude. We understand. It's our attitude about using spears... We all have that attitude. It's our attitude about... MARCH 3RD Members of the Sanrizuka-Shibayama Anti-Airport League! The enemy has turned more ferocious and is going to... Commit all kinds of atrocities. We'll fight them back, and prevent the Prefectural Governor... from taking the land on behalf of the Airport Corporation. We'll fight to smash the airport! Smash the airport! Stop the expropriation! Smash the airport! Stop the expropriation! THEY CONCENTRATED ON THE 1ST FORTRESS PEASANTS OF THE 2ND FORTRESS GO TO REINFORCE THE 1ST FORTRESS Have you passed it round your neck? It won't go round. Those in the barricade! Get out! It's dangerous. Those in the designated areas! Don't interfere with official duties! Get out at once! That's none of your business. Anything wrong in defending one's own land? TEMPORARY PERSONNEL OF THE AIRPORT CORPORATION... RECRUITED FROM ALL OVER JAPAN WITH A DAILY SALARY OF ¥20.000 We are here to expropriate according to the Eminent Domain Law. Don't interfere! Don't interfere! Carry me away! Kill us together, if you dare. Kill us both! Get done with your job! I'm chained. We're not afraid of you. We won't let you cut the chains! We'll cut your chain. Take me off chain and all. Hold fast to me! You're not going to cut this chain. Hold on tight to me! If we're to die, we'll die together. CHILDREN ARE LEFT IN THE HUT Come here! You're interfering with official duties! Interfering with official duties? But who are you? You're interfering with official duties. Don't interfere with official duties! There are children in there. Are you trying to kill them? Look at her! MOTHERS COULD NOT GO TO RESCUE THEIR CHILDREN Why don't you stop doing this? There are many other professions. You are killing people. You know that? Kill me first. Then go ahead with your job. Look at her! Take off that uniform! You might already be murderers. SUPPORTERS ATTACK RIOT POLICE NEAR THE 1ST FORTRESS THE PERSONNEL OF THE CORPORATION RETREATS IN HASTE We can't forgive such atrocities. We peasants of the Anti-Airport League have suffered for 6 years. Now the time has come when we can finally fight back. Let's rebuild better fortresses. There are lots of trees. A wooden fortress is no good. THE BREACH IN THE FORTRESS IS IMMEDIATELY REPAIRED Let's make it with ferro concrete. Let's make a barricade immediately. Steady! The first pole is already set up! Arrange the trees like this. Someone come here! SUPPORTING GROUPS DEFEND THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE FORTRESS Bring a shovel here. We can build a hut tonight. We don't mind one fortress being gone. We've learned much. SUDDENLY FROM THE EDGE OF THE FORTRESS... Let's line up. THE PERSONNEL OF THE CORPORATION COME TO FELL TREES... WHICH WERE LEFT UNCUT DURING THE DAY We're cutting down the trees. You get out at once! Cheer up, cheer up! Throw stones! Throw stones! Has anybody got hurt? THE SUMMARIZATION OF TODAY'S BATTLE. THE 2ND FORTRESS THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THE ENEMY TO BE SO NUMEROUS AND SO FIERCE THEY COULDN'T CARRY ON AS HITHERTO WITH A NEARLY NON RESISTANT STRATEGY THE DECISION WAS MADE TO FIGHT RESOLUTELY FROM THE NEXT MORNING MARCH 5TH They're very afraid. They won't get near but with the cops. They're coming to us. We must be ready to gouge the eyes out of everyone of them! You must stand by your post, but if we're attacked we need your help. That's right. But we ourselves might be in danger. We must judge the situation correctly. Non resistance is no good. We want you to obey the commands... ...issued during each moment of the battle. Let's attack in every way. Don't be afraid. To have children among us is dangerous. But they won't attack so recklessly as long as children are here. They came to break things up as soon as the children went away. Parents should always protect their children. We weren't just having fun while our friends were attacked. Everybody got together and came to help you. We didn't abandon our friends to their fate. We're all acting together with the same feeling. Most important thing is not to let the Corporation men come near us. The Corporation men will come before the riot police. We must frighten the Corporation men. Let's beat them off with our chains. We'll leave the chains unlocked. We'll pretend to be bound to the trees... And when the Corporation men approach us to cut off the chains... Beat them hard with your chains. They'll push on if we show weakness. Get the cutters out of their hands and hit them hard on the heads. You have to be on your guard. We must be always on the alert. This is a battlefield. They're here. Take your posts! THEY COME TO THE 1ST FORTRESS AGAIN EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FORTRESS IS REBUILT Hey, you! Bastards! Get on with your job! Do it! Get out! Don't let them break in! Come on if you can! Stop it! You beasts! The Chief of the Narita Police gives you a warning... Those throwing stones and Molotov cocktails will be arrested... On charge of interference with official duties and for having... Criminal weapons. THE PERSONNEL OF THE CORPORATION BEARS DOWN ON THE FORTRESS FROM BOTH SIDES THE BLOW OF A FIRE HOOK AIMED AT THE HEAD Don't trifle with us! We'll get you! Come here! You'll get it! You attacked first. No, that's a fire hook. Are you a fire hook on human beings? Damn! It's no good! THE FORTRESS IS DESIGNED TO BE INVISIBLE FROM OUTSIDE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS Let's be ready for battle. I can't decide alone. Let's consult them. EMERGENCY MEETING We're ready to be arrested. We've thrown so many stones. It's obvious we'll all be arrested. Whether we throw stones or not, we'll be arrested all the same. If we throw stones while they're too far away, the supply will be exhausted. We mustn't waste stones. But because we're throwing stones, they can't come nearer. If they break in here, how do the mothers line up? IN ORDER THAT YOUNG PEASANTS MAY NOT BE ARRESTED... THE WOMEN'S ACTION COMMITTEE PUSHED TO THE FRONT LINE AFTER YOUNG PEASANTS HAD RETREATED The Chief of Narita Police gives you a warning... We're arresting you on charge of interference with official duties... and for having criminal weapons. We will arrest everyone now! YOUNG PEASANTS OF THE FRONT LINE RETREAT FROM THE 1ST FORTRESS TO THE 2ND FORTRESS Go ahead! MOTHERS PROTECT YOUNG PEASANTS FROM RIOT POLICE Don't you understand how we peasants feel? Even you'd understand... INSIDE THE 2ND FORTRESS VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED THAT DAY I was taken away by a cop. I was arrested when I was explaining the situation to someone up there. The cops said, "You threw stones, didn't you? Why are you so wet?" And then? The cops asked me how many stones I thread, and I said, "None." That was good. I said, "I don't throw stones. I'm the boss." MARCH 6TH THEY OBTAINED INFORMATION THAT THE CORPORATION WAS NOT COMING TO THE 2ND FORTRESS THAT DAY THE 4TH FORTRESS SUPPORTING GROUPS ARE ATTACKED THE GUARDS ARE SO VIGILANT... THAT PEASANTS OF OTHER FORTRESSES ARE UNABLE TO APPROACH Stop! THE HILL WHERE THE 2ND FORTRESS IS BUILT Stop it! Now the riot police is committing atrocities against us peasants. They are trying to crush our tunnels with machines. Those in the tunnels, be careful. I can't look any longer. It's so cruel. We can't go to rescue them, either. Murderers! Stop it! You beasts! You might kill them! They'll die! Murderers! Go home! It's my land. Show your certificate! Certificate? Who's carrying a certificate at such a moment! Go home. Don't kill people. Stand back! You're in danger. Who's causing danger, eh? Stand back! You're the one who brought danger here! Look down there! There are many wounded. That's murder! Just look at them! SEVERAL FORTRESSES HAD BEEN DESTROYED UNTIL THIS DAY The students in the fortress may have already been arrested. They had no time to get away. It's bad. This is real bad. They've got the law to do whatever they want. This is what the State does. Will such fact be forgotten? Never! Prime Minister Sato and the Prefectural Governor may have been... ...dealing well with politics... But look what they've done now. Whatever they may have done is nullified. They'll have nightmares from now on. They'll be horrified of what they've done. They've never even tried to convince us. That's "National Policy!" I've really understood that it's a nasty world. They do such diabolical things. How frightening Power can be. I'm no longer grateful to the State. But such bad times won't last long. It's like land tenure in the old days. In the old days, people were resigned to oppression. But we have a proper constitution now. Nevertheless, they rob us of land, by hook or by crook... When it's necessary to them. They're even worse than bailiffs. I'm an ignorant peasant... But the State permits private property when they don't need it... To have us tend it and to levy heavy taxes... Then once they need it, no matter when, they seize it like this. This is the true maladministration. The Government talks about having respect for human life... But if this is respecting human life, people will be buried alive in the tunnels. And we can't really interfere. ??? can we express our How??? We must be always alert. They come with thousands of riot police and chase people away. What they're doing is a pitiless and sneaking plot! It's an intrigue! Even children are taking part with all their efforts. We could never lose our spirit. I'm stubborn. We must hand??? They've committed a real cruelty. They cut down trees while people were up in them. They won't??? They've come up with machines... And if somebody??? they'd say, ...before??? We must think of the tunnels in terms of such a possibility. Let's make our strategy. They are pack of madmen. They can't be??? They're??? The Government??? itself dog. It's like??? If you think they're??? The Government is afraid we'd revolt and overthrow it. They want to exterminate us. Even if they exterminate us, they can't exterminate??? peasants! In the land??? struggle The spirit will be inherited for many generations. ??? The blood will remain. Surely. ??? There will be people who'll??? Our blood will be inherited by ??? We must reconsider the tactic of going into the tunnels. I get up at 3 in the morning and go to the fortress... Even if I can't be of any help to the struggle... I can't stay at home. I come here everyday, rain or shine. It makes you mad to be jeered at by the traitors. When we first started our struggle... The Socialist Party said we could easily win through... lawsuit and the National Diet. Did the chairman and others come here even once? Did they ever challenge the Government and the National Diet? They've never done anything. We can't rely on any political party. No political party to rely on. LET'S ENTER THE TUNNEL This part is loose and may crumble in. The toilet is to the right. The toilet was once in front outside. This entrance was once very wide. But that was inconvenient. So we had to narrow it down. We had to move the toilet inside. We'd thought the ventilation opening would take away the smell... But the smell doesn't go away. VENTILATION OPENING Look! The flame gets this small. It means that this much air is coming in. The flame gets bigger here. Such a difference... Means you can get fresh air down here. Here it's entirely different. The ventilation opening down there is much bigger. The wind is stronger and it's almost cold. Entirely different. Even a small ventilation opening takes in a lot of fresh air. Are there many of them? Only one here. But some elsewhere. The flame doesn't change around here. There is no breeze. But here it gets so small. A CORNER OF THE PASSAGE It's cracking and may crumble with a slightest shock. This part is also very soft. I don't like this crack either. Perhaps the ground has fallen and made all those cracks. It may tumble down on this side. This crevice is not shallow. It may be dangerous. It may cave in at any touch. You see? This is a most frightening crevice. Such crevices are all over the passage, if you look carefully. LET'S GO INTO THE ROOM First of all, we talked over what kind of rooms we should build. Nobody had experienced digging habitable tunnels. At first, we thought of using wooden planks... To support ceilings and walls. But we decided on logs in view of long fight to come. Several households offered pine and cedar logs. We chose big stout logs, and prepared the material. We carried the logs on trucks, spending half a day. Next day we started building the rooms. We didn't use old wood. The logs are mainly pines. We call this room No. 1. We used best materials here for it's near the entrance. In order to construct the logs inside the tunnel. We couldn't dig out the ceiling because it was rock bed... So we worked hard digging out the floor and shortening the logs. As for how we made the floor... We laid a few logs on the ground and arranged planks on them. Then we spread straw about 30cm deep, and put straw-mats on it. At last we could spread mattresses. We hardly feel the cold or the moisture from underneath. But moisture is steadily penetrating for it's earth just outside the logs. Bugs have began to come in the morning. We have to use insecticide. Where do they come from? It seems rats are thriving, too. They seem to be running about. They nibble at our crackers. Usually we use sleeping bags... But few peasants know how to use sleeping bags. At first we obeyed instructions. We crawled legs first into the bag... and closed the zippers. The entire body is covered and only the face is out up here. It's as if one slept standing at attention. But nowadays... we reverse it and place only our legs in it. We don't close the zippers, and we cover ourselves with it. We feel much more comfortable this way. The sleeping bag... ...may be used properly when you're sleeping outdoors... and when you don't have a mattress. But it's much better to use it like this when you have the mattress. It's not so cold inside the tunnel. The frontage of this room is actually very wide. If the riot police step in, we can lose the front door. The door is now half closed and other half can be closed by grating. This clamp is for fastening the wire. A similar clamp is up there, too. We can lock the grating by fastening it at two places. Then the entire front is protected by the grating. When we constructed this room, we've built it somewhat inclined. It threatened to fall towards the front door. So we protected it by a prop. That prop is not a decoration. This room is awry as a whole. We have shovels ready here as well as in the toilet. Such tools are placed in all rooms. We memorize where things are kept in case of emergency. And here... This is a shelf for holding cups and bowls. You??? We're all men here. We eat together, or drink together... Well, we don't drink more than a glass or two. Nobody cares much about tiding up. We tidy up when??? before us leave??? We eat or drink with them, but we don't tidy up afterwards. I suppose this is a man's??? Soya sauce and candles are kept on each room. The white bottle is for drinking water. Water is distributed to everyone. We have no worries about food either. In principle we are not to touch the supplies... Except in case of emergency. But we nibble at them from time to time. The Room No. 2 is down there. We must walk over 10 meters if we use the usual passage. So we have dug here a shortcut. It was small at first... but it got bigger as the earth got trampled down. Let's go. We only had simple plans when we first started digging. But we've thought of many things while digging. It changed to somewhere we could live normally. This tunnel was dug only by the peasants, because it could be dangerous. We decided not to let the supporting students come in... and admitted only the peasants. We've also excluded peasants who are not too healthy. We have 4 healthy men in each tunnel. As we are all selected for healthiness... We can easily stay here for weeks and weeks. No one complains about feeling stuffy. Everyone is ready to stay here even if one dies. You prefer the tunnel you dug yourself? That's right. Though we sort of casually started digging... Once we were to live here... We naturally used the strongest materials. That's human instinct. We have absolutely faith in the sturdiness of each room. We are afraid of entering other peasants' tunnels. We won't dream of staying overnight in other tunnels. We'd come out as soon as possible. We have no worries as long as we are in our own tunnel. But we are afraid of cave-ins when we're in the other tunnels. Though they're not so flimsily made. We don't mind staying for days in our own tunnel. It was made by peasants without my knowledge. We spent much time and labor in assembling logs. To adjust the length, we had to dig the ground and cut the logs. It's a simple matter to build such room above the ground... But underground construction was different. It wasn't easy. Even if they come with machines... Of course it will be crushed easily with bulldozers. But we all are ready to defend till the last. We won't give up our land. MARCH 25TH THIS DAY SEVERAL TUNNELS WERE DESTROYED BUT NOT THOSE INSIDE THE 1ST AND THE 2ND FORTRESS You workers, students, peasants and citizens... ...who have gathered there today - unite. This is the Peasants' Broadcasting Tower. We have dug fortresses deep under the earth... And are still continuing to fight... ...in order to crash the violence of the State. Sanrizuka is still alive. Sanrizuka is living. There is no doubt that buds will sprout from this ground in spring. The victory will be ours. In order to smash the violence of the State... We ask you workers, students and citizens to be with us. LATE IN APRIL Let's change. The air is bad! I can't go to the field before 7 tomorrow morning. I'll sleep late tomorrow. I hardly wake up before noon these days. Somehow I sleep on. Few young people like to become peasants nowadays. Parents are pleased just to see us in the fields. My mother said to me... How good it was to see a young man like me become a peasant. She has true understanding. But really young people don't work on farms nowadays. It's hard work. Yes, hard work, especially at first. Where will this tunnel lead to?
