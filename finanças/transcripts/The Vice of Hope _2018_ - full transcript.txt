Stop, asshole! Let's go. - How's it going? - Fine. - Get it ready, I need it tonight. - Yes, Ma'am! What are you lookin' at? Over here! Dress warm, it'll be cold tonight. - I know. - It's colder on the boat. - Why can't we take the car? - They can see us in the car. We have to take the boat. - If it rains? - I'll take care of it. - Where's Hope? - With a client. And Fatima? She's not here. What's that mean? I dunno. Come here! Where's Fatima? I think Fatima ran away. She wants to keep the baby. I do too! I don't want them to take him. I can find a job. I can stay with him. Stop it! Quit talking bullshit. Fatima, Hope, Natalie... and this is yours. We can't find Fatima. Take the other two tonight. But find her, Maria. Or things could get nasty. - Bye, Aunt Mari. - Bye. - Good evening. - Good evening, Marcolina. I expect the third one tomorrow. - Don't let me down. - Yes, Ma'am. - Did Mama eat? - Tuna. Tuna... Why do I bother buying fresh food? What's the point? Mama... You can't sleep in the tub! Come on... How are you, darling? I'm fine. - Cover up. - Is it cold? Very! Sleep now. Yes, Mama will sleep now. - Is Fatima here? - She asked but we have no room. - Where is she? - How should I know? No point in looking, she's not inside. Fatima! You don't believe me! - You're a liar. - Fuck you! What if you can't find her? I'll lose this job. Who'll take over? Someone else. You have to stay. Only you. Because she's next. Then tell me where Fatima is. I don't know. Nobody knows anything... Just a little, okay? Yes. At this age, Health Services should give us this stuff for free. We'll eat our broth, watch TV, doze off under the covers... And we won't bust balls with our memories. Aunt Mari... Fatima. What'd she do? I can't find her. Listen up... You're credible because I taught you. You learned well and did what you had to do. But lately? You've gone soft. What's wrong? You're acting strange... It's nothing. We're wasting time... Tell me what's wrong, I can help you. Your belly's swollen. I'm always dressed so I didn't notice. You don't take showers? I don't like being naked. But you're naked when they fuck you. I stay dressed. How can this be? You're a mess inside. It's impossible. I sewed this woman up when they brought her to me. She was a mess. I told her mother she'd never have children. I cried for what they'd done to her. Are you gonna cry now or explain this? She's pregnant. She's three months and the baby's fine. So, everything's okay. No. If she gives birth she'll probably die. Die? Why? She's like a broken vase that was glued back together. If we force it, it will crack. And we'll lose her. God forbid. I need her. If we want to terminate, we have to do it now. It's already late. Dr. Corvino, I'll let you know. Don't worry, we'll solve the problem with the right people. I'll pay for it. When you find Fatima, we'll take care of it. You can go home the same day. What if I don't find Fatima? There's Tina. She was due for a check-up today. Go visit her tomorrow. She's a good one. She gave us four already. We'll make due with her for now. What are you thinking? What's heroin like? Like a velvet coat. But it's not for you. Maria, I made octopus broth for you. No, Gioacchino... You've always liked it. 11 WEEKS Maria! My friend Maria. I forgot to invite you because I'm a dumbass. I expected this wedding to last longer, but look, it's over already. Did you see the doctor? I saw him yesterday. I thought it was a fifth baby, but it's a tumor. I'm sorry, there's no deal this time. I'm having surgery next week. Before the operation, I wanted to be married! You should wear white once in your life, right? We're all broke here so people brought food, favors... and the dress. Titina can't come, but she sent this and a hug! Who? The seamstress under house arrest! - Thank you! - You're welcome. Maria... I dream about them every night. It's like you said, right? You said they're happy. It's just that... I don't see them, understand? In my mind, I can't see them. They're laughing and running, Tina. Like you and me when we were kids. There's more to life than suffering, don't forget that. If something beautiful comes your way, hold onto it! Because it's too late when it's your time to die. Don't say that... You did it for their own good. What's good for kids is their mother! Well, congratulations! Thanks. Maria! - Hey, Maria! - What? - Come here. - What is it? Still looking for Fatima? Why? She's here, come! Here, where? - Here! - Here, where? You idiot! My mind was all confused. But I'm fine now. Let's go to my house. I swear I won't run! I know... But you need to stay warm. One day my son will come back to me. Who's the father? There is none. If there's no father, whose baby is it? Who's in the bathroom? My friend. What's her name? Fatima. Where's she gonna sleep? Not here, we have to leave. Does your friend know you're a whore and don't even know who knocked you up or who to ask for abortion money? Shut the fuck up, I'm not aborting! You'll come to a bad end. That's a nice name, like Our Lady of Fatima... Listen, Fatima... Follow the main road until you see a shrine to Jesus. There's a bridge nearby, cross it... Listen! Look for a church. Ask for Father Antonio. Speak to him. He's a good man, he'll help you. And you can keep the baby. She'll kill you! Nobody will kill me. Go! You're not coming? They won't take me... Go! Be careful. Slowly! Go slow... Step up... good girl. Be careful! Good girl, you can do it. Come on, Fatima, go! Are you Virgin? Yes, who are you? I've known you since you were little. Is your mama here? What's the password? I don't know. Blessing. What do you want? Can I stay here? Thanks. What have you done? I helped someone escape. - When? - Today. You're out of your turf here so you'll be safe for a while. But not for long. Why'd you pull this stupid stunt? I don't know. I just can't do what I was doing before. Did you see Virgin? They didn't want her. Consider yourself lucky. She's beautiful. How are you? Hungry? I'm three months pregnant. Who, you? Is the dog male or female? Female, can't you tell? - What's her name? - Dog. What does that mean? Nothing. She's a dog, so I call her Dog. What about this, is it a boy or girl? I think it's a boy. So, will you name him Man? You're clever. I don't know, but that's a good name. Do you like it? I'll give it to you. - Really? - Yes. This sweater... Put it on... Like this. Then, when you want to be by yourself, pull this over your head and nobody can bother you. Hope it works. At least we'll catch something to eat! I think it'll work. - Hi, Pengue! - Virgin! The fish in this river are no good. I've told you a hundred times. Who's he? That's the way he is, like a sputtering engine. Are you making chicken? What do you think? Give us some! Be quiet! You still have that broomstick... I'm fond of it, I've had it for ages. Growing fond of things isn't good. You see? Maria. Carlo Pengue. Why aren't you at school? I studied at home. - What did you study? - Ratios. A lot of potatoes. There are never enough potatoes. Let's eat! What do you do here? I mind my business. It's a good place for that. Now tell me about ratios. A ratio is a relationship between two numbers. For example, two is to one as three is to six. That means two is one doubled and six is three doubled. That's beautiful. Don't you have nets? I don't fish anymore. She's having a baby. She thinks it's a boy and so do I. She's going to name him Man! Maybe. Man? That's a good name. I'll show you Pengue's washing machine memories. He gets mad when I touch them. I'm glad you know it. What does it mean? I worked in a carnival years ago. The Tilt-A-Whirl was like a washing machine. It works the same way: it's a cylinder that twirls quickly and the centrifugal force presses you to the walls. It's scary, but fun. Kids came with their parents and I photographed them. They all looked scared! Why'd you keep the photos? I photographed everyone. But some parents never collected them. For a few cents they denied themselves a good memory. A sweet one. Like when you know a fear has passed. I wanted to throw them away, but when everything ended and they took my house and the Tilt-A-Whirl, I decided to keep the photos in that box. That's what left of Carlo Pengue's memories. The washing machine memories. The end. This little girl is me. The only one who wasn't afraid. I remember, it's true. I wasn't scared. I think it was your First Communion. You were with your mother and some guy. A few hours after I took the photo, they said you disappeared and you were last seen down by the river. There's no star? I don't like the star. It's fake. Enough... We've been walking for an hour! This isn't a gift, it's work! You're a good man. You don't know me. I know, but you're a good man. Hang on tight. Testing... This is my Christmas present! What do I do? Nothing, don't move! 13 WEEKS Maria. Wake up. Take a shower. You have to work to stay here. Ask for fifty, give me half. What are you wearing? Who'll fuck you like that? Maria! Come here. Let's go! Come on. Come here, come here. What's wrong? Visit the imprisoned Visit the sick Bury the dead Shelter the homeless Clothe the naked Give water to the thirsty It's open. Rest now. Tomorrow you'll wake up and it's Christmas. 28 WEEKS Why do you detest us? I don't detest anyone. Your sister and I got you a gift. Look. Three towels... A big one, a small one and one for the bidet. Sanitary pads... They're enormous, I know. But you lose a lot of blood after birth. I nearly died when I had you. Some scented wipes... and a belly band. It's not very sexy, but you'll need it. And here's the best part... A nightgown. It's pretty. I made an appointment for you with the doctor. I can go with you if you want. Can't I get some coffee? No, Aunt Mari. He doesn't make coffee. Good morning. What a nice big belly you have! Come in. - Have a seat. - Just do the exam, Doctor. Come, we'll do a sonogram. Good morning, Aunt Mari. Come. Lie here. No, turn that way, your legs on that side. When was your last period? Dunno. The little sluggard is still head up. If he doesn't turn, we'll do a C Section. Hear that? The heart is healthy. That's the head... The hand is covering the face, the brat doesn't want to be seen. I wonder who he'll look like. His legs look fine. Your daughter looks nothing like you. - She looks like her father. - Lucky for her. If she were my daughter, things would be different. Do you want to know the sex? Hurry up, Doctor, I have things to do! All right. Here, clean off. The baby is perfect. The mother is fine for now. The big risk will be the final days, especially during birth. Aunt Mari... Will you give me the final payment after the birth? Right, the final payment... I understand you. You haven't done anything wrong. You just wanted a baby too. You fell for this bullshit called hope. You were infected. The doctor always told you it was pointless to hope... But... here we are. I have to admit even though you pulled a stupid stunt I respect you because... Because you know the baby will be born... and you'll die. Who knows what'll happen to the baby. But your mother wants the money. There won't be any money. A baby was paid for and that baby was lost. Fatima's baby is with Social Services and no money was made. Your baby will go to the woman who paid... to be a mother. She has a right to the baby. Even a woman who wants a baby is a mother, not just the one who delivers it. So don't worry, the baby will be fine, just like the others. That's not fair, Aunt Mari. That woman paid for a black baby, but what she'll get is... a nice white baby. It's not the same thing. It's strange, but that's the way it is. For some women, a black or white baby is the same thing. At any rate, we're even now. Sorry, you'll have to work now. It must be great to sleep forever. I won't wake you anymore. 40 WEEKS - Good evening. - Good evening. Here you go. Thanks. There are wipes if you need to wash. The Indian lady will bring some food soon. She knows, nothing spicy. If you don't feel well, tell the Indian lady. I'll be back tomorrow. I need a washing machine. We don't have one. - What is it? - It's hot. I don't have much time. But I have to teach you a few things. This is hot. Do you feel it? This is cold. This is dirty... There's nothing clean... I'll teach you that tomorrow. My name is Maria and I'm your mama. Even if I'm gone, I'll always be with you. Always. Even a woman who wants a baby is a mother, not just the one who delivers it. Go! Go! You're all obsessed with freedom. You don't even know what it is. It's an empty field, with nothing in it. Slavery is beautiful. It has rules, punishments, and rewards. Tell me, if you leave, where will you go? To Carlo Pengue. Carlo Pengue... They said he raped you and threw you in the river. But that's not true. It wasn't him. He was the one who pulled you out and saved you. But to be safe, everyone shunned him. Forever. Poor man... Carlo Pengue is a good man. This will end badly. Pengue! Carlo Pengue! Hurry... What's going on? If I die, I want you to keep the baby. No way. You're the only human being I know. You have to keep him. Grab the little girl. Come here, Virgin. Cover up. Don't be scared, don't worry. Virgin! Is this your house? Take these off me! Already? You know and I know! You know and I know! I've always cursed you because I was angry at you, but now, please... My name is Carlo Pengue. You don't know me... I want to pray for Maria. Let her have the baby! It hurts. Let her live with him. I'm begging you, on all the blood we've ever sweat, for a tomorrow. Let me die now, but give her the life she never had! Because if you don't, tell me what the fuck I've lived for!? And this is being born! THE VICE OF HOPE
