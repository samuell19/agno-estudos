I want you to be nice and clean. Are you not ready yet ? We are incredibly late ! - Dad ? - What ? - The tie ! - For you ? You're not a man, yet, are you ? What's this ? The bobby pin ? You're not gonna let Giovannino go out with the bobby pin, are you ? - It's because his hair hangs on his eyes. - Oh, really ? Did you learn the poem ? By heart ? All of it ? Let's not make fools of ourselves, okay ? ONE HUNDRED STEPS My God, will you shut up ? My head's exploding ! Tell your sons to behave ! They shouldn't sing in the car. Come on, shut up. Can't you see dad is nervous ? You should pay more attention. We're always late ! We're sorry ! We're sorry we're late ! This is the present for my brother in law ! I want to thank uncle Cesare for this beautiful party. I'm very happy to be here with my Sicilian friends and relatives. I don't speak very well, I'm sorry. My passport, American, but my heart is Sicilian ! Uncle Cesare ! Anthony, my dear Tonuzzo, you're so handsome and strong, and you look so American, but I still remember when, as a kid, you'd bring water to me and your dad, over there, in the vineyard, peasants sweating for their masters. We were poor, then. We owned nothing. Your father had to go far away, to look for fortune. But today, all these stones belong to us. We bought them with our sweat, we earned them one by one. Brother in law ! Why should we talk about such sad things in such a beautiful day as this ? If you all agree, I'd like to drink a toast to freedom and work, because they give us dignity. We'll never be poor again, never again ! Bravo ! And I want to say something to our cousin Anthony: we're all so happy you didn't choose to marry an American, but a woman from our land, because, as the saying goes: "Better wed over the mixen than over the moor" ! Let's toast to Cosima, who's so beautiful that she'll bear many kids, both male and female ! - One more thing. - It's enough ! - How many things do you want to say ?! - Come on, it's enough ! - Ok, I'll shut up ! - Let's listen to your son, Peppino. - Where are you, Peppino ? You have something to say. - The poem! Come here, get on the chair. Dear Anthony and dear Cosima, my family offers you this poem to remember our language and our land. - So that we don't forget Italian ! - Shut up ! I've always loved this solitary hill, this edge as well which takes so large a share of the far-flung horizon from view. But seating here contemplating the interminable spaces beyond it and supernatural silence and unfathomed peace I get lost in my thoughts where I can hardly take fright. And, like the wind murmuring amongst these leaves, my mind compares that infinite silence with this voice. And I think of eternity and of past ages, and of the current and alive, and of its sound, and in this immensity my thoughts drawn, and sweet to me is shipwrecking in this sea. Here we still have some of the machines. It's stuff from the Second World War. Today we put oil in stainless steel tins ! Oil into iron ? Well, I still keep it in terracotta jars. Uncle Gasparo, you're so old fashioned ! Were it for you, we'd still be in the Stone Age ! Today agriculture must use industrial systems ! What about all the money that's needed ? So what ? We'll get it from the Region. - They're all fuckers ! - Get wise, uncle Gasparo ! This is not a Monarchy anymore ! We're in a Republic, a Democracy ! Hey, this car is so cool ! 75 horse-power: it's a lot more powerful than the old Giulietta ! Where would all these horses be ? You can't even smell them ! The smell ! - When I turn 18, I'll get it. - No, I'll get the Esse-Esse. You'll never have the money ! When Uncle Cesare gets a new one, I'll ask him to give this to me. What for ? You can't even drive it ! Peppino ! Come here. Careful, or you'll smash my "stuff". Accelerate ! Let's run over all these women ! All these oldies ! Come on ! The big-bellied Councillor ! No, let's run over Tano, look at him ! Did you want to run over Tano ? You don't love him anymore ? Keep your hands off. "l want to be very rich and boast about it with everyone." "20 buildings and 100 horses, if I'm in danger will watch my back." "My calques are always with me to kiss my ass and scratch my ears !" - Your son is very smart. - He took after his father ! After 5 minutes in the car, he already knew how to drive ! He's also learned straight away whom to run over ! Isn't that right, Tano ? You wanted to show courage, huh ? - You can't even play with a kid. - Ammun?, come on ! - How much was the Giulietta ? - Why ? Do you want it too ? Me ? A Giulietta ?! They say that the La Barberas bought a Mercedes. - How do you know that ? - Because. Everyone does. Do you hang around with those damn Palermitans, now ? A Mercedes ? They should still be getting around with an ass ! With an ass ! Get close together, I want to take a nice picture. - No ! - No ! - We don't want a picture now ! Peppino, where are you ? I want my chauffeur right next to me. Let him pass ! Hey, make sure you get everybody, all right ? Here we are again in this square to denounce the... What are you ? A spinning top ? You keep on turning ! ...that was carried out at the expense of all the peasants ! - What's all this racket ? - Stefano Venuti, the painter. - The same old rally ! - What's he complaining about ? - About the airport ! - Is there a chair in here ? - Yes. There, get it. Peppino, will you stop ? Let's go. Let's go act the Communists ! - What about your beard ? - Later. Who was for this airport ? Alitalia ? The Air Force ? No ! Nobody wanted an airport here, in Punta Raisi ! Just look above your heads, and you'll understand why: Because this mountain is too tall, airplanes could crush against it ! The only real aim was to buy your lands with a few grands and then sell them to the airport people making at least a hundred times as much money out of them ! But I'm not talking to them. They don't even have the guts to show that they're listening. I'm talking to you. Yes, to you. I like your face: it's clean, and you have lively eyes, intelligent. You may be thinking that building a street, a hospital or an airport is a good thing, something that's gonna be useful for everybody. But I want you to know that here they only build to steal ! They just build to make money ! Go ahead, clap your hands, but this is what's actually happened. But you're not satisfied yet, are you ? You must build another strip, some more nice cement, other shady deals with the Mayor, the Region, even God Almighty ! That's what progress is about, my dear friend, and it's about new jobs, houses and more tourists ! Isn't this good for Cinisi ? Shall Sicilians be cavemen for ever ? Where are all these new jobs ? You and your Mafia friends ! Where would all these Mafiosi be ? You do nothing but talk about the Mafia ! What is the Mafia ? Where is it ? Anyway, I want you to know that I'm against the new strip. I even told the Mayor that it's not a good deal. Too much cement, too much traffic, too much noise... You may be against it, dear Cesare Manzella, but everybody else have already set the deal up. Who's "everybody else" ? There can be no deal without me ! Come on, hurry up, it's late ! What a moron ! Get off, go call him, move ! Come on, wake up ! Where are you ? Move this car ! Louder ! You gotta shout louder ! Where are you ? Get this car off the road ! Go look if it's unlocked. - The keys are in here. - Move ! We're already late ! There's nobody. ...now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God... He was always glad to help everyone. He was so intelligent. ..full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. - You're in here, all in little pieces... - You need to rest. You little mouth... Would you like a sip of coffee, from my mouth to yours ? Oh, look ! The President of the Region... Cousin Anthony didn't make it because he missed the flight. ..now and in the hour of our death. Amen. My cute little head... ...blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now... Mom ? The people who killed uncle Cesare... - Are they mad at us too ? - No. Why should they ? We did nothing wrong. Mom, do you know who did it ? No. What about dad ? He doesn't either. Mom. What does it feel like to die that way ? Nothing. It happens too quickly. - Stefano Venuti ? The painter ? - Yes, so what ? - How much is a portrait ? - Who am I supposed to portrait ? May I come in ? Sure. Come in. You are little Impastato. Take a seat. Sit down. Sit there. Do you want me to portrait him ? I'm sorry, but I can't. Did you kill my uncle ? - What are you talking about ? - You're a Communist. - Communists hate us ! - Who took these ideas into your head ? Who was it, then ? It was people like him. People who want to take his place. Is it true that you were friends ? That you were in jail together ? Yes, many years ago. Mussolini had us jailed. Your uncle because he was mafioso, me, because I was a Communist. But we were never friends. We couldn't have been. Is that why you won't portrait him ? A face is like a landscape: it can be a garden, or a wood, or a waste land where nothing grows. I only paint the landscapes I like. So, what kind of landscape should that be ? A river, a river in flood. That's comrade Majakowskji. - That is ? - It's a long story... Tell it ! Peppino, let's go, "ammuninni". Don't overdo it, all right ? Comrades, listen carefully, but without reacting to a thing ! Don't do anything off your own bat ! Bailiff ! After the ordinance for expropriation for public utility, in conformity with the article no. 48, paragraphs 2 and 3... No third strip ! ...according to the declaration of the regional government, since the congruity of the compensation has been ascertained, as certified by the committee, orders the immediate clearing up of the lands and the buildings pertaining to those, by, at the very latest, the 3rd of March at 10 o'clock, and gives the police the task of having this order obeyed. Comrades, listen to me ! I want to tell you something. Today we lost, we were defeated, there's no denying it. But we did show them that we're all together, inseparable, and that we do not fear the police ! Comrade Venuti, since we're here all together, we should try to figure out what we can learn from this defeat. We must first recognize our friends and our enemies. - What d'you mean ? - If the Party promises to stand by our side, to send the workmen from Palermo, but no one shows up, it means that the Party doesn't give a shit about us ! - Where's the Party ? - Get off me ! They stole our land ! Where will my kids go ? Accusing is no use. Let's calm down and try to reason. - Hold on a second, may I say something too ? - Sure, go ahead ! It's so stupid that we should get mad at one another. We should talk about what's happened. Maybe this is a useless fight. Maybe the Party betrayed us for a few new jobs at the airport. Who the fuck are you ? How do you dare telling us what to think ? You, son of Impastato and nephew of Cesare Manzella ! So what ? In here we're all the same. What are you ? A friend of the Mafia's ? Knock it off ! Shut up ! This is not a pub, all right ? Impastato Giuseppe, Impastato Giuseppe ! Come on. You scared me to death. Who said mafioso ? Was it you ? I know your name. I know who you are and where you live. - Get out ! - Don't worry... - Get out ! Get out ! It was three or four of them. They entered the pizzeria without even saying hello and started calling my son a Communist, the godson of Stefano Venuti. Then they started yelling, calling him names. I told them: "How dare you ? "You know nothing about Peppino." - "Peppino has studied !" - Your son is all right. He's very impulsive, a bit rash. - He always says what he thinks. - But I told them. "Don't you dare saying bad things about my son." "I?m the only one who can teach him manners." But I want to tell you something, Felicia: if he's really got to do with the Communists, I'll kill him. - What are you talking about ? - I mean it, I'll break his bones. - He's still young. - I'm telling you, I'll kill him. - Wait until he grows up a little bit. He'll change. - I hope so. MAFIA: A PILE OF SHIT So, what do you think ? What do you think you can achieve with this ? It's not about the Party. We just want to borrow your copy machine. This is just a childish and conceited provocation ! - Why, isn't it all true ? - Do you think I don't know ? We know you do. But we're sick and tired of waiting. - We must do something. - Right, but this is over ambition ! People would even be afraid of buying such a paper ! I don't get you. We get a few dozens of vote from Cinisi ! Do you really think they're enough to allow us to speak up ? They'll be even less, if we don't. Hey, picciriddo: you're talking to a man who's never shut up ! Get this shit and go away. Stefano, why is this office empty ? Have you ever wondered why young people don't come anymore ? "You can't do this", and "that is adventurism", and "the people are not ready". A comrade can only get depressed and feel defeated in here. Shut up, you are talking nonsense ! Discipline, obedience... It was all set up in Rome, in Palermo. When is it that we will have the right to make decisions too ? - This will do you no good. - Let's go, Peppino. Stefano, that poem by Majakowskji, you favourite one: "Do not lock yourself up in your rooms, oh Party." "Be a friend to the street people." Can you please turn this machine off ? - Did you print this paper ? - Yes, madam, I did. - Do you have any left ? - Yes, I do. - May I have them, please ? - Look how beautiful it looks ! - Yes, beautiful. When the boys arrive, tell them this paper can't be printed anymore, okay ? - Good-morning, madam. - Give me that paper. - What paper ? You know it very well. This one ? "The Socialist Idea" ? I want all the copies you have. How much is it ? One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Two thousand lira. Thank you. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. The atmosphere in the Universities is still very tense: many universities are still squatted by dissenting students. The worst incidents have taken place in Milan and in Rome. In the latter the students reached the Faculty of Architecture... What is this ?! - It's a paper. - A paper ? What about the signature ? "Giuseppe Impastato", what does that mean ? Doesn't that asshole, Venuti, have the guts to sign an article ? - He's got nothing to do with it. It was my idea. - Oh, really ? Good ! What is it that you wrote ? "The Mafia is a pile of shit" ! "The Mafia is a pile of shit" ! How am I even going to go out, now ? - Nobody read it, I bought them ! - What the fuck are you saying ?! I got it. What the hell, why don't you just finish university ? Do you want to get away from this shitty place ? I'll help you. I can find you a job straight away, in Palermo. But promise me you'll stop minding the Mafia. Sure, as soon one names the Mafia, everybody's at their service. - Who is "everybody" ? - You and your friends. You think you're sovereign, but then Battagghi's nominated, - ..and you all start shitting your pants. - Shut up. Have you forgotten how they called the Badalamentis ? - "Battagghi", like the bells for the cows. - I told you to shut up. They were headmen, right ? Pigs, cows, young and fresh calves. "l greet Don Tano. How much is the meat, today ?" "Do you have some Communist meat ?" "l have something really special for you, Mr Impastato: your son !" - "How would you like me to serve him ?" - You're so unfair. You're so insensitive. Don't you understand that if you talk like that they'll kill you ? And what will you do, if they kill me ? Peppino. Come on, get back in, now. All right ? - Ammun? ! You know what dad's like ! - No, what is he like ? He's... old fashioned, but he's not a bad person. Yeah, he's not bad, he's old fashioned. But dad's not a bad person. - You went to school, can you count ? - What do you mean ? - You know, one, two, three, four... - Of course I can. - Can you walk ? - Of course I can walk ! - And can you walk and count at the same time ? - I guess so. Okay, then count and walk. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - Where are we going ? - Come on, walk and count ! ..ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred. - Do you know who lives here ? - Calm down, let's go. - Tano ! - Don't scream ! - He lives a hundred steps away from our place. We all live in the same street, go to the same bar, we end up looking all alike ! "Let's greet Tano !" "Nice to see you, Peppino, and you, Giovanni." But they are the masters of Cinici. And my father, Luigi Impastato, kisses his ass like anyone else ! He's not old fashioned, he's just another mafioso ! - He's our father. - My father ! My family ! My town ! Screw everything ! I want to write that the Mafia is a pile of shit. I want to yell that my father is an arse-licker ! We must rebel before it's too late, before we get used to their faces, before we go completely blind ! "The characters and facts here described are fictitious, but the social and environmental reality they derive from is real." "THE END" I'd like to begin talking about the caption that closes the movie by Rosi, "The Hands on the City". It says: "The characters are fictitious, but the social and environmental reality they derive from is real." Let's try to be serious. We have the whole night to have fun. I'm sorry, Peppino, I was just rehearsing. Being a work of art, a movie can't show reality as it actually is. It re-invents reality looking at it from different points of view, thus giving it a particular meaning. We may begin our discussion now. - Comrades of the Club "Music and Culture"... - You said it right ! "Music and Culture": first music, and then culture. Comrades, you've interrupted us ! Let's rock'n'roll ! Peppino ! Peppino ! Come, dance ! Come on, let's dance ! - I gotta talk to you. - Later. Let's dance, now. - No ! I've got something to tell you ! - Now ? - Yes, ammuninni. - What is it ? - Something very important. - What is it ? Did you break the film ? - No ! - You make me worry. - Did I scare you ? - What's happened ? - Nothing ! I just want to introduce you to somebody. Felicia, this is my brother Giuseppe. - What's her name again ? - Felicia. Felicetta. Like mom ? - Like this ? - No ! Like this, I'll take it from here. - Not at eleven ! - Do you mind if I focus ? If you don't open it all up, you won't see a thing ! Who are you ? Cartier Bresson ? Okay, you take it, all right ? Did you put the filter ? It's not a cigarette ! We're not smoking it ! I mean, the objective, do you wanna change it ? There's nothing to change ! You're messing me up ! This is good. - Salvo, are you objective ? - Yes, I am objective. Well, then, take a picture at this dick ! - Did I offend you ? - No. Well, then develop it ! You know what I think ? This airport isn't that bad, after all. - What are saying ? - Well, if you look at it from here... If you look at it from above, it seems that nature still dominates. But it's not true. You can find a logic for anything once it's done, once it exists. Think of those houses with windows in aluminium and no plaster. - Are you listening ? - Yes ! People go live in them. They put curtains, geraniums, a television, and, after a while, it's as if everything had always been there. Nobody remembers what it looked like before. - It takes so very little to destroy beauty. - Well, so what ? So what ? instead of matters of politics and social class, and all that bullshit, someone should remind people what beauty is. - Teach them how to recognize and preserve it. - Beauty ? Sure. Beauty is very important. Everything else comes from it. What is it ? Did you fall in love, like your brother ? - Is it a family epidemic ? - Think of Giovanni and Felicetta. They're so young, but they're in love. They don't even know how big the world is. - You talk like my grandma. - It's just that Giovanni's so simple. He meets this girl and introduces her straight away to my mother, to all his friends, even my father has a soft spot for her. - I don't see anything wrong in it. - I envy their simplicity. I could never be like that. As soon as you meet the right girl, you'll be just as simple. I don't know. Could be. Listen, ladies and gentlemen. Rush, ladies and gentlemen ! We'll begin with a very simple question. - What's the shortest distance between two dots ? - A line ! A straight line ? Maybe in Stockholm, or in Milan, or even in Siracusa. But here, the shortest distance between two dots is three curves ! One, two and three ! They are absolutely beautiful and shapy curves, really incredible ! Do you have a clue of how this geometrical miracle took place ? - They sure do ! - You're always so full of malice ! But the mean Mayor, preferred a highway that would turn and whirl. He had good reasons, though: the drivers would have more fun, and they wouldn't risk to fall asleep while driving ! - Mayor, am I right or what ? - Stop it, go to work. Am I right or what ? What do you think ? The thing is that this garden belongs to some friends ! Friends of friends' of friends' of friends'. This, for instance, is MP Pantofo, beautiful-belly man ! And this is Don Cesare Manzella, bless him, who made a great show exploding with his car. And this one here is my father, Don Luigi Impastato. This is Don Saro, cousin to a very, very important man... Tano ! Sitting Tano, excellent Governor of the colony of Cinisi ! - Impastato. - Here I am. - Now you will all clear out ! - No, we won't ! I said, take all this stuff away from here and go home ! Our Constitution gives us freedom of speech... Then show me the authorization to occupy a public area ! - It's a re-occupation of a public area ! - What're you saying ? Do you think you're the only one who's pissed off ? Go away ! Now ! - Barbabl?, are you sure it works ?- Of course it does ! The last time they broadcast us was a couple of days ago. - It seems war stuff ! - What ? This is cool stuff, okay ? - What about this plate ? Does it work ? - Yes ! It's a Technics M51: it's a unique, very rare piece. - We only need to buy a head. - Brigan Tony, Santo and Johnny, "Il Guardiano del Faro"... Did they use it for "Canzonissima" ? They're very old records. What do you care, anyway ? - We need it to make a radio station. - Palermo and county. Yeah, right, and the Aeolian islands ! This stuff's too old ! Nowadays all you need is a recorder and an antenna. I just want to be heard in Cinisi. They will... when it's windy ! Yes ! When it's windy, or sunny, or rainy. When they won't let me do a rally, when they seize my stuff... They can't seize air ! - That's not the way to do it ! - You've pissed me off, now ! - On your right ! - No ! The other way ! What're you doing ? lf you don't keep from the rain, it'll break ! It never rains in Sicily: do we have to do it tonight ? - We gotta broadcast tomorrow ! Turn the mike on ! - I'm soaked ! A wet dog, is a lucky dog... Come on ! - Why don't you hold this, try to be helpful ! - No, I can't. - Shit ! There it is ! - Careful ! This is the Mayor's dog. We're here to interview the dog, - ..hoping that he can give us news about his robber. - Robber ? No, I'm sorry, "master", that's what I meant. Okay, let's ask him a question: what do you have to say about it ? Woof, woof, woof ! Well, well. We have an interpreter for Doglish, Dr. "Turu-Tard, my cookie's very hard" ! The Mayor's dog is telling us to mind our fucking business. Why should we ? Don't they mind ours, in the Mafia Hall ? - You mean the Town Hall ? - Yes: the Mafia Hall in Mafia City. Let's now listen to the national anthem of Mafia City ! Now it's the Mayor's turn. "Dear colleagues, today we are here to approve of a little unauthorized building right opposite the airport." - How tall will it be ? - I don't know ! Four, five, six floors ! - It'll be a skyscraper, like those in Chicago ! - Too much ! - Airplanes need room ! - I don't give a shit ! They'll pass by somewhere else, or we can build them a nice tunnel ! - Hey, Luigi. - Cousin ! - Hi. - Tano would like to get you a coffee. - Where ? Here ? No, at his place. Now. - Please, be honest: is something wrong ? - No. Watch out ! Who's there, in the square ? Who's that guy in front of the Mafia Hall ? He's the Great Chief of Mafia City, Sitting Tano ! Ugh ! - He's got his personal project too ! - Of course ! A holiday village with bungalows, and, above all, squaws ! - Squaw ? - Females, whores, hookers, many, many hookers ! But, above all, a lot of... - Are you all right, Peppino ? - I mean... - Do you have a cold ? - O-ain... - O-ain... ? - O-ain, cocaine, the very best you can find,... - And, above all, "friends"... - What's this "friends" ? A whole bunch of friends coming over from the States to bring "many dollars" for Don Tano ! But what's important is that they'll build the holiday village. They'll build it by the sea, on the peasants' lands, with the money of the South Development Fund ! - Assholes ! Six billions ! - Six billions ! 6 billions, all in Tano's pockets, because Tano is King of Cinisi ! Sitting Tano, Great Chief of Mafia City, subscribes ! "..those, with the long arms, sometimes as long as 2 leagues !" "Mind me, said Sancho, those are not giants, they are windmills." - "And what look like arms, are wind vanes." - Luigi... "The windmill couldn't work without them." - "It's plane, Quixote said..." - Peppino, come, we need to talk. I listened to the radio. It was very nice, really. - You said very smart... things ! - Are you crazy ? - It's nothing. It's nothing. In church... when you were still a child... at the religion lectures... what's the commandment they thought you ? Honour thy father. They told you: "Honour thy father". Do you honour your father ? Tell me... do you honour your father ? Honour thy father. Say it. Honour thy father. Say it ! Honour thy father ! Come on, say it ! Honour thy father ! - Honour thy father ! - Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Who is it ? - Did I wake you ? - No, I wasn't sleeping. - Don't put it on the bed, it's dirty. - Don't worry about it. "Ombre Rosse", "Quaderni Piacentini"... - What about Pasolini ? - I found this one too. You're so skinny. You should eat instead of reading ! "It is not May, this impure air and the dark foreign garden - ..get even darker." - Quiet, they can hear you ! I'll read another one ! Quietly. "It?s hard to say with a son's words what at heart isn't like me at all." "You're the only one who knows what's always been in my heart..." - .."before any other love..." - These words are beautiful. - You can say them too. - No I can't ! - Come on, just try ! - No way ! - Come on, here, read. Try ! "..That's why I have to tell you what's horrible to get to know: my anguish comes from your grace." You are irreplaceable. That's why the life you gave me is doomed to loneliness." "l don't want to be lonely." "I?m immensely hungry for love, love of bodies with no soul." "Because the soul's in you, it is you." "But you are my mother, and to me your love is slavery." "The teams are not back yet. Turin is winning." "The goals were scored by Sala and Graziani. And now Naples." "Here, the second half of the match has begun 2 minutes ago." Picciotti ! You look like you've never seen a girl before ! Today I'd like to talk about a very important matter: the always augmenting use of drugs, both heavy and light. What allows us to distinguish between light and heavy drugs, when they imply no physical addiction ? ..but revolution will never take place if women will be summoned to fight for a proletariat that hasn't thought of their needs. Women will be able to change their condition when they realize that they are being take advantage of... - Hi, may I ? - Sure, come in. Hi. I'm Theresa. Who is Peppino Impastato ? It's me ! Oh, oh, oh, keep the right ! Italy, no England ! Oh, I always forget ! Oh, Peppino, Peppino, isn't it great that we should meet ? - I had a feeling that we would meet, sooner or later. - Really ? - Sure, I know all about you guys, and Radio Aut. - I'm glad. Your only limit is that you only touch on local matters. A lot of politics... But it's not lively enough... But, I mean, these are just trifles, you guys are good. - Peppino, we'll do great things together. - What d'you mean ? Our commune can do a lot for something like "Radio Aut". - Speak louder, I can't hear you ! - We could be useful to you. - How ? - I don't know... We could help you become less provincial. Midway, upon the journey of our life, I found myself in a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost. Ah, how hard a thing was that dick savage, rough and stern, towering right in the middle of the glade ! It is Cinisi, a disgraced place, for all those who inhabit it are broken, ugly and their ass is staved in. "Why, said l, is this place inhuman ?" "Because for 30 years everybody have been voting the Christian Democrats." We arrived at the heart of Mafia City... ..where stood those whose breath stinks for all the asses they've licked. My Teacher told me: "Turn around, what are you doing ?" "Look, the Vice-Mayor is awake, you'll see him from the belt up." Thou, Vice-Mayor of Mafiacity, what are you doing here ? "Leave me alone, he sadly said, I am doomed to have the typhus, "l tried to move the Sports Ground and now they tell me: it sucks !" Don Peppino Percialino, maker of swindles and mountains, was there as well, and he was sniffing some cocaine. Yes, he was indeed, some cocaine straight through the nose, oh, no, wait, maybe he was pissing, no, shitting, I can't tell if he was groaning or shooting, but he yelled: "I?m still a gentleman, friend of my friends' and of Pantofo's and I'm guiding a confraternity: Ecce Homo, and now in my ass is an artichoke." "Ouch! its thorns prick my ass !" But to redeem themselves from sins, now everybody prays. Go ahead, pray, Don Tano. Don Sitting Tano's faith is great. Who knows ? Maybe even now he's praying to repent of all the sins he has committed throughout his life, and we will forgive him. We forgive him and all the people from Mafia City, Don Tano, we forgive you ! Felicia, do you know that the Communists have introduced divorce in Italy ? - Why are you telling her ? - Why ? She can finally divorce me and marry her son Peppino. Ammun?, dad, leave Peppino alone. Do we count anything at all here ? "Who's the guy passing by ? It's Peppino Impastato, the King !" - Where are you going ? - These matters don't concern me. No, no, sit down. I want you all to listen to this. I'm fed up. I'm leaving. - And where would you be going ? - I'm not gonna tell you. - Oh, really ? And how long will be gone for ? - I don't know. A day, a month, a year, who really cares, anyway ? - Why are you leaving ? - Because if things won't settle here, I swear that I'll just sell everything and leave. - And I'm not coming back, ever again. - Right ! - And who's supposed to take care of your family ? - You ! Teach your children manners. Teach them ! Teach your children manners ! Then... As soon as I get there... I'll get a cab... Of course, I'll have to get a cab. I just hope it won't be a black guy... I hope it's an Italian... Who's gonna take me there ? Oh, Jac?, Jac?, look ! There's the guy who sells the rice pancakes ! Hey, Jac?, get me two pieces ! - They're very warm. - Just what we needed. Thank you. Fifty dollars ! Fifty ! Fifty dollars ! Luigi, you should have your son come here. If he likes the radio, we'll find him a job in a radio. It's full of radio stations broadcasting Italian music, here. Does he like journalism ? Many of our friends are journalists. But then he should come and live in America ! At least he'd stop hanging around with those people. There are no Communists here, am I not right, Cosima ? Luigi, don't worry. I remember Peppino when he was still a child and read those poems out loud. He was an all right picciriddo. Uncle Cesare used to say that he was the best of the family. - Get the present. - Matilda, please ! I got something for Tano. Get the packet in my bedroom. As you get beck to Cinisi, bring this gift to Tano and tell him: "This is from my cousin Anthony, from the States". He'll understand. Here. Thank you. Luigi, don't worry. There are no bad people in Cinisi. Peppino will be all right. Plus, keep in mind that Tano is a man you can reason with. Everything's has been all right since he's been Mayor. I just wish there were more people around like him. I'll tell you something: before even touching Peppino, they'll have to kill me. Kill ? What are you saying ? You guys will talk it over. We're not animals, are we ? Prejudices and repression of needs are what the power is based on. Sexual taboo is the weapon the bourgeois employs on kids to keep them entangled in its schemes. What the bourgeoisie can't accept is the overcoming of the schemes, this would be the real revolution. We're using Radio Aut to launch our proposal: the liberation of the body. On the 1 5th of August we will all be naked on Cinisi's beach. This way we'll symbolically show that we're willing to fight to regain our spaces, including our own body and our eroticism. And since we're not moralists, we'll name this operation: wild buttocks ! Please, step back ! Lady, please, come here, it's dangerous to stand over there ! Please, if somebody dies falling down, we'll even have to pay ! Come on, step back, everybody ! Impastato ! Impastato ? Have seen your friends ? - Why don't you do that too ? - So that you can arrest me ? Ah, you're so serious ! I was ordered to leave them alone. After all, they're not hurting anybody. - To be honest, I don't mind these "wild buttocks" at all ! - Good. Then why don't you take off your pants too ? Do you think you're funny ? Give me your documents. I have no driving licence. Go away ! - Were they really naked ? - Yes, totally ! Your problem is that you've never read Marcuse: you can't understand ! Why didn't you go and show your wild buttocks ? - What are you saying ?! - You are such Pharisees ! Peppino, you gotta go: your father's here. They're usually on time, it's strange... - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Luigi ! - What a pleasant surprise ! When did you get back ? - Just now. I wanted to say hello. They told me you were up here. One needs to check personally one's own business. As they say: "The master's eye maketh the horse fat". If I don't check them out, my men will make a horrible cheese. - May I say hello to my cousin ? - You sure may ! - Welcome back ! - I'm glad you're back. - How are you, Tano ? Let's not talk about me. You're the one who was in America. - Tell me about it ! - Tell you about America ? - Are you joking ? You're famous over there, everybody loves you. Yeah, I know, thanks God Tano is loved by everybody. Actually, I even have a present for you. It's from Anthony. - Remember him ? Peppuccio's son ? - Of course I do. A tie ? A tie ! Tano the heardman with a tie ! I am a country man. Anthony wears it because he hangs around with important people. Tell me something, Luigi. If I give this tie to Paolino, is your American cousin going to be offended ? Well, you know, it's a gift. Tell me something: is everything okay at your place ? - Have you seen your son yet ? - Peppino ? Didn't you know I threw him out ? - While you were in America, Peppino went back home. - What ? No big deal, she's a woman. After all, she's his mother ! Luigi... I really don't want you to go home and get mad at your wife. - You must promise. - No, I swear that I'm sending him to America. - I spoke to my cousin. He'll go to America. - Don't worry. They've calmed down. They have changed subjects. Now they sing: "Let's go to the beach and show our white buttocks !" - Come on, Peppino ! - Are you crazy or what ? - Come on ! Open up, it's us ! Your friend Peppino is acting like a Fascist. Hey, pretty hair, what the heck do you know about Peppino ? All I know is that he's a fucking Stalinist, just like all of you. - Really ? Well, fuck off ! - Do you think you can do whatever ? Fucking Stalinists ! Stalinists, pieces of shit ! Shame on you ! If you've been listening to us, you must have noticed that many things have changed. We talk about various matters, now. Through Radio Aut we've tried to spread a code based on a libertarian behaviour. We're fascinated with the idea of "re-possessing our body". Who doesn't believe that we should live our sexuality freely ? We love our comrades from Milan, from Bologna, or even from India. The German and English girls are beautiful. They make you want to quit the whole thing and leave with them. But this is neither Paris, nor Berkeley, no Woodstock, nor White. This is Cinisi, this is Sicily. They're just waiting for us to give up and start again leading our old silent lives. The reason why I squatted in the radio was to get your attention. But I can't do this by myself: we must all go back to informing, and telling the truth. We must be truthful also about our limits. Enough of this serious stuff. Let's listen to some music. I want to thank all those who've been patient enough to listen. Peppino. - Ah, it's you. - Who did you think it was ? - I thought that maybe... - What ? - Never mind. - Tell me. - I've listened to you. You know, I agree with most of what you said. But you can't just do it all your way. You can't just squat in the radio... It's not yours. Sometimes, if you want people to hear you, you must scream. It's not true. If you do, people will think you're sad and worried. They won't listen, they won't hear you. How was your trip to America ? It was long... but it was good. Are the American cousins all right ? They're very well. Actually, my cousin Anthony... He told me that, if you want, you can go and work over there. With your radio, and everything. The radio ? - Your radio station, that's what he said. - To America ? - Yes. Do you want a ride ? You know I like walking. I'll go for a walk, I'll go on foot. Good-night, then, dad. Good-night. "What's America like ?" "It?s beautiful." "How are your cousins doing ?" "Ah, very well." What the fuck ! Why doesn't anyone ask me how I am doing ? Ask me ! Come on, ask me ! "What did you go to America for ?" "Do you want a ride ?" Yes. Right, and where's this ride supposed to take me ? Will you tell me something ? Not at all ! But... when you were a kid you did talk to your dad. Do you remember the poem ? "Sweet..." How did it go ? "Shipwrecking..." But now... Don't worry about me. I'll manage. I'll find a ride. I sure will. Luigi Impastato has no problem finding a ride. Please, will you give me a ride ? The family grieves for the premature death of the beloved. ..thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Excuse me. Good morning. You cannot treat them this way ! You must be respectful towards your father and his friends. You can't mess around in front of everybody ! I'm sorry, I don't understand English, I don't remember it. - Let's speak Italian, then ! - Anthony. - Peppino, excuse me. - What is it ? You shouldn't do that, you shouldn't offend them. - I don't want to see them ! - You get your family into trouble. Now that your father's gone, there's no one to protect you. What are you talking about ? Why do you think they've never hurt you ? 'Cause they're afraid ? Now you must really be careful ! - What are those ? - Just dad's papers. Actually, these are my magazines. You know he liked to keep everything. But, I mean my articles, my flyers... Do you remember this ? "The Mafia is a pile of shit !" "The Mafia is a pile of shit !" I can't believe it, he really kept everything. - Will you read this ? - You can't read anymore ? No, ageing made me blind. Will you read it ? "l want to give up both politics and life." - Did you write this ? - Yeah, a few years ago. Who knows what I was thinking about ! Maybe you should have given up politics for real. What ? Do you have fun provoking people ? Do you have fun getting other people into trouble ? What the fuck are you saying ? It was our father's funeral. You just had to turn even that into a rally, you had to challenge them even there ? Do you want to act the hero ? The martyr ? Saint Rosalie ! So that we can walk you in procession too ? - Hey, you're going too far ! - Do you think of other people ? Of what they feel ? Do you think they like watching you as you dig your own grave ? And while you act the hero, do you think of those who have to bust their ass in your place ? "Giovanni, do this ! Giovanni, do that !" "Giovanni, help your father. Giovanni, cheer up your mother." Do you think it was easy, that I had fun ? - You're right, but calm down now. - Anybody can act the hero ! - Tano is a mafioso ! - What the fuck are you doing ? I can act the hero too ! I can do it too ! I can do it too ! Mom should sleep somewhere else for a few days. Maybe at aunt's. We should take care dad's stuff, it'd be too painful for her. We'll talk about it tomorrow. - It's closed ! - Mourning ! For the premature death of the beloved, - ..his sons and his wife grieve... - Knock it off ! I know you're mourning. But I'd like a coffee. Well, I guess I'll make it myself. One should be able to do anything, even coffee. I can make a coffee no problem. I can do anything. If you only knew how many times in my life I found myself alone. Today... I was to go to the cemetery... to honour a friend of mine who's not with us anymore. Instead, I decided to go to the country to think. I thought: "Why is it that Tano cannot honour his friend Impastato ?" But, above all, I tried to figure out why they don't want Tano to attend the funeral of his friend Impastato. Why ? Maybe because of this thing I have in my pocket: "Sitting Tano, paleface, expert in shotguns and heroin smuggling." That's why they don't want him. How can he possibly honour his friend if this is what they think of him ? "Sitting Tano, paleface, expert in shotguns and heroin smuggling." That's why I wonder: does Tano smuggle all the drugs passing by Punta Raisi ? Do all the refineries hidden in the country of Punta Raisi belong to Tano ? But then, this Tano is a monster. He's the Devil, he's the epitome of cruelty; Tano is wicked ! He's wicked. Who says so ? But above all: how can he say so ? Has he seen Tano doing all this ? No, he hasn't. Has he ever seen Tano smuggling drugs ? He hasn't. Has he seen him refining it and bringing it to America ? He hasn't. But he'll say all these things anyway. While I was in the country I thought of my friend Luigi and these two picciriddi. When he came to me crying, saying: "Tano, help me find a job." "Tano, help me find the food." What does Tano Badalamenti do ? He speaks to this and that, he bothers a couple more friends and tells them: "You must find Luigi a job: he's got a family." Luigi starts working, and earns his own money. He buys this nice pizzeria, and sends his sons to school, so that they'll never have to suffer like him. So that they'll learn not to submit as he did. And all this thanks to Tano, Sitting Tano paleface, expert in shotguns and heroin smuggling. Now, you offer me this coffee, and we'll be even for gratitude and respect. I perfectly know that being good only makes people hate you. It's a natural law. But you must not hate me anymore: this coffee fixes everything. If you want to keep on hating me, Peppino, fine. You're so petty, that you're just a great laugh for Tano. Your insults don't even reach me, because you don't even exist. You're nothing mixed with nobody. You don't even have to worry, because Tano will protect you. It is only thanks to Tano that you can keep on braying like horses... Iike asses. ...dramatic, incredible news: the President of the Christian Democracy, MP Aldo Moro, was kidnapped a short time ago in Rome, by a terrorist group. It happened right in front of the MP's house. A colleague is telling me that four people died and one was hurt. While he was kidnapped, Moro was badly hurt too. These are the shots... please, can you move to the car door ? Here, they seem to have been shot with a machine-gun. Here, on the floor, on the right, you can still see the cases. Here you are ! You guys are so good ! Will you blame it on the Mafia, now ? - You guys suck ! - You deserve a death penalty ! Nothing can resist, here. Peppino, we do resist. Our radio does exists. For how long, still ? - They almost lynched us in there. - Because they're just paledicks. They can't distinguish between the Red Brigades and us. But that means there's something wrong. It's just that it's easier for them to lump us all together. That way, they'll finally make us shut up. They'll shut our mouth ! I've decided to run at the Municipal Elections. I believe I can count on about 100 votes, maybe more. Are you coming back with us ? No, I'll run for the Proletarian Democracy. Do you need my approval ? The people who'll vote me would have never voted the Communists. At least 100 votes would have been wasted. What if you got them ? I'll do at the city council what I did on the radio. I'll watch them closely, I'll compel them to respect the law. Once, at the office, you told me: "All we can learn here is defeat." We will always be defeated, because we want to be divided, so that we can do it all our own way. Open the drawer of that table. - When did you do this ? - The first time you came here. Citizens of Cinisi ! Don't act like these goats. Go against the general trend ! Vote the Proletarian Democracy ! Vote Giuseppe Impastato ! Comrades of Cinisi, don't be intimidated by the atmosphere that the kidnapping of Moro has imposed on the whole of Italy ! That atmosphere has made everybody united against the Movement, as if we were all terrorists and murderers ! Don't get trapped. Next Sunday you'll have to decide whether you're with the Mafia or against it ! There are unfortunately no more news about Aldo Moro. We were anxious, yesterday, since it was supposed to be the day... Peppino ? Why don't you get yourself a gun ? A gun ? What am I supposed to do with it ? Defend yourself. Can't you see that everybody's gone crazy ? So, should I go crazy too ? You know I've never liked guns anyway. Peppino, I'm scared. Let the others do their rallies ! Why do you have to be there too ? What's all this thing of being a candidate about ? It shouldn't be given for granted that we agree with all he said. Now, we'll listen to Impastato... Are you working for the competitors now ? During a campaign you must let anybody interview you ! Yeah, but you don't know if "anybody" is gonna vote for you. "We run to denounce the bunch of *** who have governed up to now." Sons of a bitch ! See how the assholes... "This town will be free only when we won't have to call it ***, and when Mr G*** B*** won't be the master of our life anymore." - What's the name of this radio ? - "Terrasini Centrale". It's not in here... They're even ashamed of putting their name, them paledicks ! They live on ads, they get money from everywhere. I'll go get something to eat at my mom's. - Did you fix the plate ? - Don't worry, it'll be okay. - I'll meet you at nine. - Can you give me a ride ? - Sure. - I'll see you at nine, then ? - Yes, be on time. - Hey, you guys, where's Peppino ? - Weren't you in Palermo ? Where's Peppino ? It's important. - What did your cousin tell you ? - That I shouldn't come to Cinisi because tonight something was going to happen. - To whom ? - This is all he told me: that I should stay at home. - What should we do ? - Go get Salvo and check the alleyways by the airport. We'll go at Peppino's. - Vito, what's the matter ? - Is Peppino here ? - Isn't he with you guys ? - No... but I'm sure he's on his way. - Vito, is something wrong ? - No... it's nothing. - Oh ! lf you find him... - Yes... I'm sure he's with Salvo. Bye. He's not here. Let's go back, let's go back ! There they are... Help ! Help ! - Did you check by the beach ? - We're going back there now. No, go to Punta Raisi. We'll go to Terrasini. Come, Major, come, it's here. What're those people doing there ? Move, please, move. Nice job ! So, Maresciallo, you said you found a car ? Yes, sir, an 850 belonging to a guy I know. - Who's this guy ? - Come with me. This way. This is the car. It's Impastato's. I just think it's weird that the car is here, while the whole thing actually happened there, on the railways. Let us talk to the Maresciallo, we must talk to him. Here. Everything's far too plain. See, Maresciallo ? These are the wires he used to set off the bomb. But they should have been long enough to get to the railways. - They have killed our friend ! - Who are they ? This a proof ! They are friends of Impastato's. They work at the radio. Send them away, I don't want to see them around here. This stone's got blood on it ! This is where they killed him ! Maresciallo, send them away, and if they offer resistance, take them all to the station. - This is where they killed him ! - Here's the proof ! - They killed him ! - They killed him here ! - Maresciallo ? - These are the proves ! Shall we solve this case, or what ? Salvo, is it you ? - Whose is this room ? - This is my bedroom. What's happened ? Hey, what the hell are you doing ? Here's a flyer. It's for tomorrow's rally. Seize books, notebooks, magazines, everything ! This stuff belongs to me ! "l want to give up both politics and life..." Brigadier ! What're you doing !? Stop ! I'm only obeying the orders ! Salvo, what're you doing here ? Salvo... Get away, get away ! This morning Peppino should have held the final rally of his electoral campaign. There will be no rally. Nothing will be broadcast anymore. Peppino left us, he died, he committed suicide. No, don't be surprised, because that's what actually happened. That's what the Carabinieri and the Magistrate say. They say they found a sheet of paper saying: "l want to give up both politics and life". This should prove that he committed suicide. So, in order to give up politics and life, he went to the railway, hit a stone with his head, he scattered blood all around the place, he wrapped himself up in TNT, and explodes on the railway: suicide ! Just like Pinelli the anarchist who jumped out the windows of the Milan Police Headquarters, or like Feltrinelli, the editor, who exploded on the Enel pylons. They all committed suicide ! This is what you'll read tomorrow on the papers, this is what they'll say on television. Actually, you'll read nothing at all, because tomorrow papers and television will talk about something very important: the finding, in Rome, of MP Aldo Moro, killed like a dog by the Red Brigades. Of course, this news will make anything else look like a trifle. So, who gives a shit ? Who the fuck gives a shit about the little provincial Sicilian ? Who the hell is this Peppino Impastato ? Now, do something: turn off the radio, turn your back on it; we all know how these things work, anyway. We all know that nothing's going to change. You're lucky: you are sensible, and that's what Peppino was not. Tomorrow there will be his funeral: just don't go. Let's leave him alone. Why don't we Sicilian just admit it once and for all: we want the Mafia ! And it's not that we're afraid of it. It's that it makes us feel safe, we identify with it, we like it ! We are the Mafia, and you, Peppino you were nothing but a dreamer. You were artless, you were a nothing mixed with a nobody ! - Felicia, cousin Schillir? is here. - I'm here. You have all my sympathy, Felicia. I have a word for you from Tano: he says he's sorry for what's happened, and that he's got nothing to do with it. What else ? That, as for the funeral... you should stay at home, that you should see to Giovanni, now. Go away. Go away ! This is not my son. They broke him into pieces... They broke him into pieces... Peppino was crazy... but he was one of us. No, he was not one of you at all. And I want no revenges. Where are his friends ? His comrades... Have they already forgotten him ? We are the ones who're here. His family. His family. Anthony. What's going on ? Peppino is alive, and he's fighting with us ! Our ideas will never die ! Peppino is alive, and he's fighting with us ! Our ideas will never die ! "The Mafia kills. Silence kills too." They have not forgotten Peppino. Peppino Impastato was murdered on the 9th of May, 1978. In 1997 the Court of Palermo asked for a committal for trial for Gaetano Impastato as the instigator of the homicide. This movie was realised thanks to Peppino's family, his friends and the "Sicilian Centre of Documentation Giuseppe Impastato".
