A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM OUT OF ORDER May I? It's broken. Do you want me to fix it? Do you know how? I can try. Do you know what I do when I'm scared? I count my heart beats. When I'm scared, it beats fast. But if I am focused, they slow down. Try it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... You're not scared any more, are you? TEN YEARS LATER GRADUATION PARTY It's over. Free at last. Well... Now comes the worst. I hope my marks allow me to go to college or they'll put me in the store with my father. In 20 years I picture you yelling around and throwing cell phones against walls. I'd rather jump off a building. What marks would you need to be a pilot? - Wanna come? - Where? GRADUATION PARTY - Ok. - Cool. As long as you are in control you don't have to be worried. Ok. - Honey, I'm going to the store. - Ok, Mom. How was it with Anchi? We've been talking. Poor thing... I forgot to tell you that's the price for a close encounter. I really like her. She loves horror movies, like me. Oh, and she goes to therapy as well. She goes to a shrink too? Psychotherapist. Right. Well, after one year of "psychotherapy", if it wasn't for me, Ha-ha. We also talked about you. About me? Fuck, Bram, don't talk to people about me. - Why not? - Because... I dunno... So... What did she say? Am I the one she's in love with? That's why she's constantly looking at me... No. Actually, she doesn't even like you. Thanks for sharing that with me. I actually love her. I'm very into nerds and freaks. That's why I'm always with you. Well, we'll talk tomorrow, she's waiting for me. Have fun. Mom? Bosco? When have I failed my word? Listen... Answer me. Answer me, when have I failed? I'm telling you the IOU expires tomorrow. Look at the date. Look at the date! What does it say? I'm telling you, it expires tomorrow. Calm down! I'm very calmed! I'm going to the bank to fix it right now. Calm down! Fuck! Hello? - What's up? - What's up? I dunno, you just woke me up. - Breakfast later? - Yes, sure. - See you at yours? - Eleven o'clock. Sure. Bad morning, Bosco. How did the night go with Anchi? How was it last night? How was it last night? Fine, I told you. It was fine. Whoa whoa... All this secrecy... Something's going on. What? I'm watching the movie. You've seen it a million times, they're all the same. They say they're scary, but they're disgusting. Do you want to know something really scary? What? Last night, when I got home... What? Something happened... Maybe I dreamt it. Well, I probably dreamt it. But it was totally real. I've never been so afraid in my life. Your father forgot his lunch. Why won't you tell me how it went with Anchi? - Do you think I'm jealous or something? - Shut up. You're so weird today. Is it something she told you? Tell me. What? I can't believe that after all this time... I told you! - She doesn't like me. - It's not just that. What, then? This is so typical, she'll want you for herself and try to distance you from your friends, well, from me. Stop telling me how the world works! I'm not dumb! I know the way things work. Well, a little bit dumb... How can they drive so fast here? Give me more time, just that. Please, help me. Give me more time. What can I do? You can't do this to me. If you shut my store I'm fucked! - Help me, please! - Wait. Listen to me. Listen to me! Listen to me, fuck! Fucking listen to me! Help me! Listen to me! Listen to me! What's up, Mom? Hi. Is it just me, or is your mother going more... She won't get any better. As long as she has to put up with my old man... How did your father die? Why? Dunno. You never told me. Honestly, I don't know. Come on. How can you not know? Well... About my father... It's weird. I only have bits and pieces. I was very young. Although I always thought he died of exhaustion. All his life working, being bitter... Doing the same thing every day. If bitterness killed... none of us would be alive. Do you want to have lunch at my place? - Well... - Right. - I can come with you both. - No. - Bram, what's going on? - Nothing. Nothing? - Should I ask her? - Will you leave Anchi alone? As soon as she tells me what's happening here. - No, don't do that. - It'll be over sooner if you tell me. This. This happens. You get into everything in my life, have an opinion about everything. This morning I called you to tell you something. - But in the end... I didn't dare. - Don't worry then... I won't give you a hard time. I'm leaving myself. Mom? Bosco! Mom? This phone is out of service. Please, leave a message. Abraham? Hello? Laura? ABRAHAM CERBERO DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT BY DR. KARLA BERGER 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... - Jesus, Bram! - What? - Why didn't you answer your phone? - I was with Anchi. What's wrong? I can't find my mom. Or Bosco. So? It's not like her not to answer her phone. But it's not just that. What? - Your apartment. You left the door open. - Shit! Perhaps I closed it on my way out. But I swear it was open. Is dad home yet? Here we go... We'll see how he comes today. Dude... I didn't realise that your mother was here before. She's like a ghost. - And you realise that now? - Dinner is ready. I had a friend once, but the doctor told me to stop seeing him. Why? That's what I told him. But he insisted... I don't know how many times I've seen this episode. I know it by heart. Don't make a big deal about it. Hey, I didn't know people lived down below. - Down? Where? - In the apartment in front of mine. No idea. Mom? Do you know anything about that? About what? About the people living down below. No. Nobody lives there. Why? I just thought... I thought I heard people. Noises. There may be squatters. Nothing. Look what time it is. - Do you think it's all connected? - What? I don't know, everything. I hear voices where I'm not supposed to. My mom disappears... Don't worry. In the end, all this will only be... Where is the boy? Abraham! Abraham! Do you hear me, Abraham? Do you hear me? Open or you'll be sorry! Open! Open! What happened? You fainted. Did my mom call? This phone is out of service. Please, leave a message. You look awful. How's your mom? Go figure. But it's over. Next time I don't know what I'll do to him. You know I'm here for everything you need. - Yeah, but this... - For everything, Abraham. I mean it. Hey... - I'm really sorry... - Never mind. You've never talked to any girl but me. Your mom doesn't count. So... I can get that you lost your mind because the Chinese girl noticed you. I'm leaving. I'm sure my mom's back with Bosco. - Anything you need... - I know. But this shit with my father... I have to deal with this by myself. Mom? Mom? You have one message. Alex, everything's fine. It had to happen, sooner or later. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Do you want me to fix it? Do you know how? I can try. Hey! Who are you? Get out of my car! Out of my car! Hey! Get out of the car! What happened? My dad was run over by a thousand cars. He's in critical condition. Jesus. - You won't believe what happened to me. - To you? - Now what? - Paperwork I guess. The store's bankrupt. There's nothing but debts. This is just what my mother needed to definitely lose her mind. Are you okay? Bram. - I'll be in your room. - Ok, I'll be right there. Is Alex still here? It's obvious that your mother doesn't want me to stay. - I'd better go.... - Stay, please. I need you. Just for tonight. You can wear this. What will your girlfriend think about me spending the night? Do you think I care? Listen, stay tonight and... Tomorrow I'll be helping you. But stay. What are these doing here? What are they? They're my father's car keys. I HAVE TO DO IT, BUT I CAN'T. WHAT SHOULD I DO? Bram! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Police? Police? INCOMING CALL: ME Let me help you. Bosco? Hello? Mom? Mom? Pathological dissociation occurs when the child has to deal with overwhelming or fearful situations. CONSCIOUS. UNCONSCIOUS. SUBCONSCIOUS. KARLA BERGER, PSYCHOTHERAPIST. 6TH FLOOR. Abraham? Abraham, we've now regressed... to the night your father was run over. I'll ask you again... What happened? Abraham? Abraham. Abraham. Alright, we... We'll stop here for today. I'll be counting from 10 to 1, when I get to 1 you'll wake up. 10... Mom! Doctor? Bram? Bram... Let me talk to her. No, I won't. I'll be alright, okay? I just want to talk to her. Finally. Alex? Sorry if I've been a jerk, but I'm not here to argue. You won't believe what's happening to me. I told you what I saw in the shower that night. - Well, it's not just that. It's as if... - Stop it, Alex! You're right. Something's happening. - And you're responsible for it. - What are you talking about? This. I told you I would take care of this, my way. You've fucked everything up. I thought it was absurd. That you weren't dangerous. Dangerous? Me? - What's wrong with you? - Alex, calm down. You... Leave me alone. You've already fucked my relationship with... - What have you put in his head? - Me? No, Alex. It's you. You are his problem. Not his solution. Mom? Mom? What happened? My mom tried to kill herself. Your mother? Now you call me, right? When I need you, you're gone. But now that is you... No, Alex. It's not that. I've been delaying this moment for a while. I didn't want it to come. There was a time when I needed you. But now I don't. Now that my father's gone... And I have Anchi... - You being alive is a burden. - Being alive? I'm sorry Alex. I have to do this. - Do what? - Deep down you know. Sometimes you feel out of this reality. Through the years it's become worse. You practically didn't feel anything. You had to do things... To remind you of your senses... Or feelings. How do you know all that? 'Cause it's the truth. You don't have them. You only feel what I want you to feel. So that's what you think? - That's what they made you believe. - It's the truth, Alex. - Why can't you accept it? - Because it makes no fucking sense, Bram! And this? Why don't you stop me? If I'm only in your head why don't you stop me? 'Cause it's like a dream! I create them but I can't control them. - That's crazy, Bram... - Exactly. When you're five, it's normal to have imaginary friends... But at my age, it means you're crazy. You can't do this. I'm sorry, Alex. All of this... You, your life, your family... Your existence... I dreamt it all. It's time to wake up. You can't escape. You only exist here. OUT OF ORDER DOESN'T STOP AT THIS FLOOR I'm Abraham. Sorry to call you this late, but something happened. Is it Alex? Thanks Mom, you can go now if you like. Hurry up, Abraham. Your father's about to get home. No, Gabi. No. Listen to me. You haven't paid me for four... five months. I can't take it any more. Don't you understand, Gabriel? They'll take my store away. Don't take this the wrong way. Listen to me. Don't hang up, Gabriel! Gabriel! Fucking hell! Son of a bitch! Fuck! I warned you. Come in. Let's try and fix this once and for all. - Wait here, Anchi. - Can't I come in? No, you've done enough. Please... Let her, she's just... She's what? Trying to help? You see what you get doing things your way, willing to take shortcuts. So please, stop it. Stop playing psychiatry. And now if you'll excuse me, Anchi. Abraham. How are you now? Scared. Where's Alex now? I don't know. Abraham... Alex can't have gone anywhere. I don't know, I can't find her. ABRAHAM CERBERO DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT "The dissociated parts may influence the way he behaves, feels or remembers. He may not realise what he does or experiences." If she isn't in your conscious... She might be in your most repressed memories. Your subconscious. Let's try to get down there. Are you ready? I'll count from 5 to 1. 5... "For others, it may seem like he's lying. This is called amnesia, the incapacity of recovering important information about the present or frightful situations from the past." "The most extreme form of dissociation occurs when these dissociated parts take full control of the child." Of course. 4... OUT OF ORDER DOESN'T STOP AT THIS FLOOR. You shouldn't be here. 3... You shouldn't be here. 2... 1. Abraham. Here I am, Doctor. Are you Alex? We finally meet. Abraham... You have to be strong. You can't let her take control. You prefer being the one controlling him. Telling him what to do. Alex, calm down. No one's going to hurt you. No? That's funny. I'd swear you've been trying to kill me for weeks. Alex, stop it! She never wanted to kill you! - She was trying to save you! - From who? No! Alex! Alex! Alex, no! Alex! Alright! You win! I'll disappear! But I have to do something first. When I hid in there... I saw something... that you must see. Hey! Who are you? Get out of my car! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! What's going to happen now? You tell me. I'm scared. Right. Of course. You'll have to fix it by yourself. I'm really going to miss you. I know. You know what? I'm scared too.
