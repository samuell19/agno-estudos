Well. A German multinational wants to outsource its production, and we meet all the requirements to make its new toys line... The Germans want to buy us. What does it mean, exactly? That we'll no longer make our own toys. Now we'll make theirs. We thought about relocating you in the Production Department. But we are designers. If you want to keep designing, you'll do it at home. I assure you, you won't do it here. Well, let's not forward events. The Germans will send us two people from Barcelona to value the company, and they might make us an offer. Which company? Gamerland. [phone ringing] Lucía's company is going to buy us. Yes. If you trusted our proposals, nobody would need to buy us. Don't you see I'm doing it to keep your jobs and the staff? Not ours, precisely. Well, it's ok. It's ok. It's your company. Do what you want. Anything else? Yes. You could dress better when the Catalans come. They are serious. Could you be more specific? Please? Just don't look like a sissy. Good morning. Let's take the balance sheet. [laughing] [speaking German] I knew it. Well... We have to study the company carefully. You heard it. They are very clingy with the Polish one. You are not doing it for me, right? [laughs] No. I really love you, Lucia, but not as much as to risk my career. If we had a branch in Valencia, I'd be the Germans' right hand in Spain. I'll help you with whatever you need. I hope so. [laughs] For now, we have to go there to check the accounts. No. You have Mario for that. He is an accountant, I'm not. Why does your face change every time we talk about Valencia? You didn't think about the good part. In the morning, we'll check the accounts... and at night, we'll be in a hotel at Malvarrosa. I can't tell my parents I'm coming to Valencia and not stay at their house, because I'm sleeping with my married boss in a hotel. "Married" but not for long. [phone ringing] They need me in accounting. Let's talk later, ok? Okay. -Lucia. -Tell me. I need you to come to Valencia. You know that company best. Is There a Generic Business Model? Looks exciting. Not really. That's called masochism. No, it's reading to fall asleep. If it's good, I'll stay awake. Get in bed. You're going to catch a cold. It happens when you wear a sexy nightgown. If you like book titles with questions, you should read... Is my wife invisible? Or even better... If I go on this way, will my marriage go to hell? No, one of those you and your friends read to quote on Facebook, like... I woke up today with my happiness glasses on. We have to go to couple therapy. Carmen, please, don't start. This can't go on like this. Carmen, I can't see a thing. That's the problem. What about Mireia? I really liked her. I did, too. But I think she didn't like me that much. I saw her the other day. She told me she married an attorney or a lawyer. She looked sad. She'd be better with you. You never know. What about Alba, the doctor's daughter? Aura, you mean. Don't mention her. She has odd habits. She was the kind of person who needs to have everything organized. On Saturdays, go out to dinner. On Fridays, go to the movies, at five. -On Sundays from six to seven: sex. -Don't exaggerate. [phone ringing] [laughs] [phone ringing] Andrés. [phone ringing] I'll go. Open the door, please. He gets very anxious. [Santi] Grandpa, I didn't tell you when everyone was listening, but I think you are wrong. You know perfectly well that the toys we sell aren't anything new. Everybody makes them. We gave you more unique prototypes that would have less competition. Don't try, son. Your grandfather is stubborn. Yesterday, I almost sent him to hell. Andrés. When we risked a bit more, things went well. Honey, you can talk about this another time. It's my birthday, and we know how this will end. Let him speak. Tell me, according to you, when did things went well? In the Christmas season in 2010. You didn't want to sell the crazy car. We sold 100,000 units. Only one ad in local TVs. With the benefits we renewed the packaging equipment. I told you a thousand times. That's because Iberic Toys went bankrupt. No, grandpa. I looked it up. It was at the end of 2011. He's like his father. He thinks he knows everything but... He doesn't even dress like a man. That's enough! Stop calling my son a sissy. It's ok, Dad, I don't mind. I do. Carmen, please. The doctor said one glass per meal, and you've already had two. Take the doctor seriously, at least. What a joy, celebrating my birthday with my family! In the flower shop, they told me that watering it once a week was enough. Look. Look how it is. Most plants die of water excess. Did you know that? What's this? A birthday present I got for myself. We can choose between... "Romantic Córdoba" or "Love among the Mills". This one is really good. It's a charming rural hotel in La Mancha. It's about you and me being alone and calm for a few days. Carmen, I can't go around there, visiting mills. Do you know the mess we have at the company? I'm not talking about going to China. It's just four days. I can't. Not now. And when is the right moment for you? I don't know. When we resolve the company's sale. I have a lover. [laughs] Carmen, please. What? You don't think I can? Sure. One lover or two, right? [laughs] Let me tell you something. This is not worth it. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen! Carmen? [music] If I were half as good as you, I'd have left long ago. Like Lucia. If it's any comfort, my son's favorite toy is Detective Raccoon. See? We don't sell it either. Keep the prototype. One day it might be worth good money. I should charge you for using my son as a guinea pig. Is Clara becoming hotter every day, or I'm getting older? She is hotter. -But you are getting older. -Asshole. Thank you. You know, last night, on the internet, I found a Japanese device. You put your dick in it. It vacuum packs it. Better than a blowjob. You haven't received a good one. You're a jerk. -It's the future. -I see. You don't even need to fuck. A good porn movie, this thing, and you decide how and when. Here? Here. Now? Now. It's only up to you. What about the hug after that? The kiss? What? [doorbell] -Hello! -My daughter! What are you doing here? Giving you a surprise. -Oh. -This is heavy. Let's see. I want to say happy birthday to Mom. She's out, but she'll be back soon. I think. -What's the matter, Dad? -You look really nice. Come in. I'll make your bed. [doorbell] Are you ok? Call Nuria and Paco. Maybe she's with them. No. She'll be back when she stops being angry. What did you say? Nothing. She's acting weird lately. She's got a kind of autumnal passion. She's like Sophia Loren in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. I haven't watched it. But it sounds good, right? [phone chimes] -It's Mom. -What did she say? Hmm. "I'm divorcing Dad. But don't worry. I'm fine." [phone chimes] -Where is she? -Huh? [phone chimes] Are you in a WhatsApp group without me? [phone chimes] [both] Yes. She doesn't want us to go. She needs to be alone. [phone chimes] She hung up. We know she's fine. Let her be. Hmm. [phone chimes] [phone ringing] I'm coming. No, my parents aren't home. Yes, you can come another day, ok? Ok, see you. I'm leaving. My boss is here. See you at the office, ok? Cheer up, Dad. Everything is going to be ok. You'll see. Thank you, daughter. I love you a lot. I love you, too. Come on. See you later. [door closes] -[phone chimes] -[phone line ringing] [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] Where the fuck is your father? Grandpa, I don't know. What? Is this inappropriate, too? It's perfect for a carnival. [phone ringing] Sorry. -Hi, grandpa. -[Abelardo laughs] You both like it informal, so this is Ferran, Director of Production at Gamerland, and this is Abelardo, owner of Playtime. It's a pleasure, Abelardo. Welcome, Ferran. Lucia has talked about you a lot, and well. She has talked a lot about you, too. But not so well. [both laughing] I like people with a sense of humor. I think we'll get along. Yeah, sure. Also, we have a lot of things in common. Where is Andrés? I really want to meet him. Something came up, but... He'll be here soon. Please, call your father and tell him we are starting. Yes, of course. This way, Ferran. [phone ringing] Hello? [Santi] Dad, where are you? On my way. Hurry up. The Catalan is already here. Also... Mom is at the beach house, ok? Thank you. [music playing] That was the day we met, right? -Do you remember? -Of course I do. Do you remember... what you told me when I asked you what was the matter? -No. -¿No? No. "Come back when you're a foot taller." Fuck. How embarrassing. -Did I tell you that? -Yeah. -That's terrible. Terrible. -Terrible. Terrible. [laughs] Listen. What happened, eventually? With what? With the foot you had to grow, because... -Ah, ah... -[laughs] Ah! I thought you were quitting. Sorry, it was my fault. It's a habit. [music playing] [grunts] [bell rings] Here. No, no. I don't like this stuff. It's a possible new toy line for adults, asshole. If we can't sell Detective Raccoon, how are we selling a plastic vagina? Are you stupid? I'm not showing it to Abelardo. We are taking it to other companies. And if we manage to sell it, we get out of here. Five million sold last year in Japan. Remember when we used to wank with the left hand and go to sleep? I did it with both. Fifteen Euros per unit. Do the math. [bell rings] [Lucia] In Barcelona, there's this homemade food bar and it reminds me of you when they have cannelloni. Those aren't as good as these. I was looking forward to eating together as a family. Mom, are you gonna tell us what's going on? The problem is that... nothing is going on. You can talk and fix things. You should see a therapist. A therapist. Tell your father that. It's as if therapists are the Devil. Are you divorcing, then? -Come on. -You know what? I will be very sad, but life is very short. And if you can't fix things, you have to make drastic decisions. Right, Santi? I don't know... I'm not the right person to talk about couple issues. [knock at door] Come in. [door opens] I've had a talk with Carmen. It's your business. She told me to stay out, so... I'll tell you only one thing. If the word "divorce" comes up, you know what will happen, right? The Catalan is always asking for you and I don't know what to say. So focus and take him out for lunch to "La sucursal" or some place. He seems to be very refined. Come on. Look, Abelardo. Get by on your own. I have more important things to do. What the fuck are you doing? Where are you going? Andrés! Very stretched to create something new. Hello. You'll have to wait for a bit. Sit, please. You'll be next. We'll draw a line... The first thing we're going... We raise it like this... Here, a lock that goes loose. Then this... this... like this. Put it like this. I want you to go calm. Don't ask. [laughs] You like it? I can assure you, you will be sure. Huh? Ok? Come in, please. [music playing] So, a good haircut? I didn't come to get my hair cut. Color? You don't have to be ashamed. Nowadays most men do it. I do it. I reinforce it with highlights. I came to kick your ass. [laughs] I knew it. I was told you'll get mad. You are Alex's father. You won't believe it. I asked him many times before I did it. Did you talk with your father? He says "I'm a grown up and I can do what I want". Too pink, right? Now it's in fashion in China. -China? -Don't worry. It'll grow. Hey, don't be mad. I'll cut your hair for free. Sit down. The boy is your clone, huh? -What are you saying? -So, how do you like it? Very short? -No. -Just the tips? Neither of them. -Do I thin it out a bit? -No. That's it. -I'll fix your bangs. -My bangs? Sandra, honey, what do you think? It's perfect. Are you a couple? [both laugh] I'm his daughter. Unfortunately, for her. She has my nose. Are you married? The hairdresser is supposed to be the gossiper. No, I'm divorced. -Divorced? -By the way, what's your name? I'm Raúl. Antonio. -Hello. -Loli, honey, what did he say? He's not interested. Too big for him. Don't worry. I'll post an ad on the internet. Or a sign in the dashboard, as always. [Loli laughs] Right. Which car is it? A classic one. Actually, it's in very good condition. Especially the inside. It's what gets worn away the most. Sit down. Are you married? Yes. Why? Women really like this car. It's elegant. It transmits a lot of things. It gives confidence. Have you had a lot of women here? No, of course not. Well, as a divorced man, I've had some. What? Are you interested? What team is this from? Tecnidex's. Do you like rugby? Rugby? -Of course. -Which is your team? I always cheer... one or the other. It depends. It's ok. You don't need to be a fanatic. -Were you a player? -Sure, with protection, helmet and all. That's football. Football? Helmets and protection are for football. I know. I used to play football and rugby. I was very good at both. Listen. I have to go back. If you are interested, we can meet one day and take a ride. -Yes, I'm interested. -Do you want my number? Raúl Giménez. What? Raul Giménez. Like the rugby player. -The defender. -Oh, the defender. Very good. Tell me. 637-41-52-60 Ok. See you. MOTHERFUCKER You're worn out, honey. Leave it for tomorrow. I'm looking forward to going to your favorite restaurant. I'm not tired. Oh, that's good. It's just that I'm a bit upset because of last year's balance. I see. Maybe this cheers you up a bit. The mailbox key is not there, but the doorman is getting a new one for you. Have you left your home? A forty meter terrace on the most beautiful street in Gracia. You told me you love the flats with big terraces, right? There you have it. All in one. This is very difficult for me. You always make decisions by yourself. Well, it's not a problem. We can look for one together. Also, the agency owner is my friend. So I won't lose the deposit. [laughter] ARE YOU COMING, ASSHOLE? I'M GETTING DRUNK ALONE -What are you working on now? -Nothing. -Nothing? You are working. -It's a new project. -Show me. -Wait. This one looks like a dick. They're toys... for adults. Oh. So can we try them? How is your son? Come over some day and see him. I would love to. I have fun with him. You could have fun with his mother as well. But maybe she'll get tired of asking you to play with her. [Miguel] Do you go about barefoot in Gamerland as well? Well, not always. But sometimes I do. What are you doing here? Now you get paid for overtime? Excuse me, but I always stay when I'm needed. Especially to give you a hand. Well, I'm leaving. I'm meeting Ferran. You are a good team. Yes, we are. Wait, wait, wait. Thank you. [music playing] Have you seen my shoe? Look, here. [thud] Sh... it. Here. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want anything? The subway will be closed soon. I see. I can give you a ride. No, really. My mom is waiting for me. -So she can go home. -Ok. Right. Wait. [Raul] When you find a great woman your age, girls can go away. -You think so? -I don't know. I once hooked up with a woman my age and she was married. -It ended really bad. -How? Suicide. Fuck. I'm shocked. My girl is married, too. I couldn't bear it if it happened to her. It will. I know it first-hand. Where are you now? -She's moving out. -Moving out? No, come on. She's probably on a break. -No, it's serious. -Really? Now the worst is yet to come. Her husband chasing you to crush you. Her family screaming. Her crying non-stop. Well... My married girl and I couldn't bear it, so in the end, we broke up. Broke up? Didn't she kill herself? Yes... that's why we broke up. What an asshole. What? You are an asshole. Look, now that we're friends and I see you're a jokey guy, I'll tell you something very funny about her husband. My girl has fled to her house in the beach, and the other day I was looking for a pen. I opened her night stand drawer and I found a whole bunch of white underpants. Those ones with a hole to take it out. Can you believe it? How can he be so old-fashioned and tasteless? I don't know. Old-fashioned always comes back. Hey, how much plastisol do you think we need for the glans part? Hey! Wake up! Why don't we work at the bar? If I have to work overtime, I'd rather have a beer. Because I'd rather be left in the lurch here. I've already said I'm sorry. I forgot I had a date. Yeah. Did it go well, at least? Yes. Did it? Yes. Show me a picture of her. What are you saying? Show me a picture. Fuck, no. -Don't be like that. -I won't, dude. Why are you here? What about you? You're not the only one who works on Saturday. I've come to steal a cigarette from Miguel's desk. I'll have a smoke on the flat roof. Do you like bats? Bats? I don't. Why? They can't see like us. I know. They're blind. But they have radar that tells them where things are. Did you know some of them are one meter and a half tall? A meter and a half? Fuck, that's a monster. Almost like a human. I sometimes compare things in my mind, and I thought... that man is a bat. -Who? Her husband? -Yes. That motherfucker. Hey, show some respect. No, I'll call him a motherfucker. Okay... The thing is, he has an amazing wife. She's in front of him, but he doesn't see her. He knows she is there. -Thanks to his radar? -Exactly, but he can't see her. Yesterday, Carmen was terribly sad. My girl. And I think it's his fault. He sucks her energy. Like a vampire. He does nothing to get her back. And I think that's hurting her. Maybe he's found out about you... Haven't your heard what I said? He's a fucking vampire. Were he here, just like we are, next to each other, he wouldn't recognize me. Hey, careful. Vampires are nasty pieces of work. What are you saying? He's bloodless. That's why he sucks her blood. He's a jerk. It's not as bad as that, sure. Look, Toni, you're obviously a good guy. You can't understand there are men like him. But you know what? She's getting a divorce. Even when she told him she had a lover, he laughed in her face. Is he a jerk or not? Yeah, he's a bit of a jerk. A jerk wearing old men's underpants. [laughing] [music playing] Carmen! I'm not here to argue. I just want to talk. Hold on a minute, I'm coming. Carmen do you like my pants? Well, now that you mention it... Not particularly. Do you think I should wear those...? -Boxers? -Yeah. I dunno... I prefer them to hold tight. I feel safer if I have my balls held well tight. Sure. Life with one's balls held tight is way better. Look at yours. But do you think you can fix our relationship by changing your underwear? Carmen, let's try again, please. What happened to us? I don't know... I've been thinking about it over and over, trying to remember what went wrong. Why don't we take a few days to think it over? Alone... No distractions. What do you mean? I'm not going to go to work. I haven't been going for a couple days. What about the Catalans? They'll manage. For once, I'm gonna do things properly. Let's try to find out what went wrong. Look for a solution. Just a few days, Carmen. Let me think about it... Yes? It's not that easy. [knock at door] [doorbell] [knock at door] Where have you been? Why won't pick up the phone? Abelardo, I swear the last thing I need to do now is arguing. Leave me alone. Ferran is upset. I can tell by his face. It's not working. They're not gonna buy it. We must switch to plan B. I don't wanna hear a thing about that plan B. We need to grease his palm. If he helps us out, we'll stipulate a percentage of the money we get for him. I only want you to do this: Take him out to have some drinks, get him a bit drunk... and persuade him. If he doesn't accept, I'll put a horse head in his bed, right? -What are you saying? -I think it's a terrible idea. But do what you want. Now, if you please, leave me alone. -Have you been drinking? -No! [phone ringing] Goodbye. Bye. [phone ringing] MOTHERFUCKER -I'll let you know when I come back. -What are you doing? Thank you for coming. -You've been very kind. -I won't tolerate this! Thanks for coming. Bye. Raúl? Yeah. I was just going to call you. I'd like to take it to a reliable repair shop. Yeah, that's it. We leave it there... and have some beers while they work on it, right? Good. I'll call you when I get the appointment. Thanks. Cheers. [Andres] How are you? Aren't you a bit down? Carmen has told me to leave her alone for a while. Huh? I'm sure it's because of her husband. Maybe... maybe he's not such a jerk as I thought he was. Hey, how did you meet? Married women on the prowl know how to make you notice them. I guess you're already aware. Thing is, we only had a hairdresser-client sort of relationship. But suddenly, one day she just burst into tears mid-dyeing. Why? Because of the motherfucker. She had so much accumulated distress, she was utterly inconsolable. And what happened? Well... I hugged her. We were like that for a while. Since she had the dye on, she couldn't go home to cry. And at that moment, in the back room... something happened. I can't explain but... we connected. By "connecting" you mean... you made out? -No, no, not at all. -Ah. We made out long after that. But that very evening, I texted her asking her how she was feeling. And in a natural way, we started chatting. Chatting? And little by little, you know. Kisses. -My hand under her skirt, and so on... -Yeah, yeah. So... you started dating very recently, right? No, not at all. Since Christmas. Oh! Thing is, I took a long time. She wanted us to be just friends. But I'm very good at chatting. Are you? -I'm going to text her again. -No! No, no. Don't do that. She asked for some time, yes? You're going to get the opposite if you're on her back. Ignore her! Don't text back! Let her be. She'll miss you that way. Feminine psychology. Do as I say. I know I'm right. I fucking hate to admit it... but I think you're right. Shall we have another? Fuck. I think the last beer didn't sit well with me. Yeah, the other six or seven did. [laughing] Look, they've parked the car right there. You know what? Screw leaving her alone. I'm gonna text her. What? No, don't do that! Do you want her to leave you? Do as I say, man. I... I should know. I've been through that. Fuck, Antonio. You're a good friend. Don't you see the worst thing you can do is telling her you miss her? Excuse me, I was gonna be more original. More original? What were you gonna say? I'd say: "Thank you". And I'd wait for her to ask: "What for?" And then, I'd say... "Thank you for every smile of life... for every shared kiss." [laughs] It's good, right? Does she like that? Yeah, yeah. -Smile of life? -Yeah. Look, don't text her. I'll tell you when, okay? I give you my word. Fuck. It's not on the floor. What's the matter? We've been robbed. We've been robbed? The windscreen wiper! Nah, man! Don't worry. I'll give this car to you as good as new. Nothing's wrong! Don't fret... I'm fixing this. But only 'cause it's you, huh? -You're such the thief. -Hey! What the fuck are you doing? We've done nothing. I saw you taking the wiper off, moron. Hey, hey! Don't insult my friend, huh? You're fucking passing it to him. I don't have anything! You should be ashamed, at your age... And your friend? He's got nothing in his hand? Which hand? This one? Or this one? Fucking drunkards. It's only ten fucking euros. Get a new windscreen wiper. Hey, don't be angry. It was only a joke. Here. Take it. -He shit himself. -He shit himself! [music playing] THANK YOU... WHAT FOR? THANK YOU FOR EVERY SMILE OF LIFE ...FOR EVERY SHARED KISS [speaking in German] The Polish company is worse, Ferran. You must convince them. For Playtime to be useful to us, we should fire half the staff. Starting with the designers. Did you hear? Staring with your Miguel. Why are you using that tone? I don't know. You tell me. We've been friends for years. I see. A friend you tell your little secrets or a friend you... -have a good roll in the hay with? -Are you jealous? I'm just curious. You're jealous, and that's not the right way. We were a couple, we lived together for a couple years. Shall I give you a report on all my exes? No, you'd better introduce him to me just as an employee... so that I can see you feasting your eyes on him. Don't rummage that much, or you'll find my dirty linen. We're having some drinks. Coming? Sure. Toni, we trust each other, right? Yes, of course. Even if you don't buy the car, you'll at least pay for gas, right? We're driving a lot of kilometers, long ride. Yes, of course. Sure. -[laughs] -You're in a joking mood today. You look very happy. I'm meeting her tonight. -Tonight? -Yeah. Today? -What the... -It's about time! I've already seen ten documentaries so I don't think of her. Right. Last night I watched a great one. Do you know what female ejaculation is? -Sure, man, an orgasm! -No, no, it's not the same thing! Women can have orgasms but not ejaculate. In fact, that's what usually happens. But... stimulating them in a certain way... they can even cum like we do. It looks like urine, but it's actually a white liquid coming from the G-spot. Hey, does your wife do it? Not that I know of. Carmen does. Careful, a stop sign. -[car horn honks] -[crash] To being reborn. Don't overdo it. It hasn't been that spectacular. The car didn't crash on your side, right, you cunt? -The headlights were this close. -Come on. Here you have the papers to the car. You only need to add some details. I thought you'd leave me in the lurch. It's the least I can do. I'll transfer the money on Monday. Fuck, Toni. You're a great guy. -This has been a sign. -Yeah. A stop sign, to be precise. [laughs] Don't make me laugh! It hurts. I don't believe in those things either. But this... makes you consider what's really important. The first thing I thought about was... my wife. Me too. Please, forgive me... It's just that... I thought I would never see her again. I would never feel what I feel for her again. I'm going to call Carmen. I'm going to tell her... we'd better meet tomorrow. I don't want her to see me like this. Carmen? Hi, how are you? I'm glad to hear that. Listen... would you like to meet me tonight? Tonight, yeah. Really? Do you want to meet at our spot? Yes, the one where we always meet. Thank you. See you later.

Hey. Have you got some herbero? Yes, it's homemade. -It's from Alcoy. -Give me some. You're a bit tense. Aren't you comfortable? Yes. Yes, I am. How could I not, being with your family? Although I'd like your father to be here. -It's a liquor that-- -Excuse me. Where are you going? To the toilet. May I? [Abelardo] Yeah, sure. [laughs] I'm taking these, okay? These glasses. Leave mine, okay? Here, grandpa. -Cheers. -[Abelardo] Cheers. Herbero is made in Alcoy. And not only in Alcoy. In a bunch of other places, too. Close your eyes. Remember. -Egypt. A marketplace. -Oh! You were very excited. Women were giving you exotic foods to try. And you accepted all of them. And then, you were dying at night. I've never seen anyone vomit like you. That's when I fell out of love. But you spent the whole night sitting on the floor because the bed was this tiny, laying wet towels on my forehead. Yes. And I remember watching you sleep, despite your slovenly face... your watery eyes... and your red nose. I was watching the most beautiful woman. Then I knew I would do anything for you. Even leaving your side. Is that what you want? That message proposing we should go to China made me very happy. But... there's something wrong. How have you changed so much in so little time? I didn't want to tell you because I'd feel embarrassed to admit it, but... I've been... I've been seeing a therapist. Andrés... Andrés, that's... that's fabulous! Yeah. It's true. -Of course it is! -Yes. Did you like it, then? I mean, did you like it... a little? Of course. If I didn't like you, I wouldn't have made out with you. -What happened? -There was no chemistry. And that's it. It's not the end of the world. So... we're not hanging out some other time. I see these things really clearly, you know? [Carmen] It's the other one! Wait, hold on... [laughing] Thanks. You've always been so skillful. I wonder why you stopped playing the piano. Are you determined to tell me in one night everything you haven't told me in years? Yes. -Yes, is it that obvious? -[laughs] Well. Now, that you're safe and sound, at home... I'd better go. No, no. You can't go. -We must drink the last one. -No. Let's not ruin it, Andrés. There's only one way of ruining it. Don't go without having danced a little. Just a little. [music playing] To this sale being beneficial for everyone. I only wanted you to know... that if it is good for us... it will be good for you as well. I mean... we'll all do well out of it. Excuse me. Could you come with me? -Well, kids, I... I'm going -So soon? Yeah, it's already late for me. You keep it up, eh? All that's on me, okay? -Bye. See you later. -Goodnight. What's wrong with you? You're fucking him, aren't you? Why do you say that now? I know you're fucking him. I know. Ferran, you drank too much. -Why don't you go...? -Look, Lucia, for the love of God. Don't think I'm an idiot! I never asked you to explain anything. It's not the same and you know it. Are you? Let's go to the hotel and talk... Are you fucking him? Answer the fucking question! -Yes or no? -Yes, I'm fucking him! And I love him. Is everything alright? Miguel! Miguel, are you okay? [music playing] ♪ Close your eyes ♪ Tell me what you see.

[Lucia] What are you doing? You're back home! No, no. It's not what it looks like. -You were-- -We were just talking. [laughing] -Yes. -Yeah, talking. -We didn't hear you. -No. Hold on. You're drunk. -Yeah, but... -You're drunker. Look at dad's face. No, I have a stiff neck, huh? -Sure. -But who cares? You're together again! -No, but... Wait. -You're going too fast. -Let's celebrate. -Yeah. What the hell? Andrés, you're aiming at the palm. That's better, Mom. -There. -Come on, smile! -[camera clicks] -Another! [laughing] It's been a long time since we last took a picture of the four of us, right? I believe the last one... was the one with the little donkey. Little donkey? What donkey? It was Vicentín's, the photographer we always used to hire. Right, Vicentín! Yeah. -He had the shabbiest studio! -Yes! With his deep red cloth, covered with stains... And he used to put a plastic donkey as a decoration in every picture. Jeez, I just traveled back in time! I'll take pics of my kids with it. But you'll need a girlfriend first, right? Not really, no. I can always adopt some. Or make a deal with a friend. Life's not just having a partner. I don't quite agree. I think a child must... -grow up in a stable family. -Sure. Like ours, right? Well. Don't lose hope. We still have Lucia. And the boxer. Why didn't you tell us you had a boyfriend? Because I wanted to explain my situation. Because you wouldn't understand. He's married. And we were lovers. Well, we understand perfectly. Yeah, these things happen. Anyway, when he said he wanted to leave his wife... and get serious, I realized it was me who... didn't want to get serious. See? Love makes you dumb. He's so jealous, he smashed Miguel's face in. Poor thing. Are you dating Miguel again? We're brothers-in-law. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I've always liked that boy. Hey, stop, don't go so fast! Or you'll have me married before dawn! No, sweetheart. You all do what you want. At this moment in our lives, we don't have the right to judge. -A toast to our mother. -Come on. Because she's here. Tomorrow, who knows? -Carmen. -Hm? Stay. It's not a good idea. What do I need to do for you to trust me? -[phone rings] -There's my taxi. I'll go with you. No, no, no. I'd rather go alone. Andrés... I'm leaving. That son of a bitch, Toni! Andrés... Andrés? I can't believe it. I can't believe it! How could I've been so damn stupid? Jeez... -Sweetheart, does it hurt? -A bit. Does it hurt? Poor thing. But... but why would he do that? He's not right in the head. Who would do that? And he hasn't seen a therapist, of course... It's all a lie! He's taken advantage of what I said to him to trick you. -But he doesn't feel it! -He's done it for me. Carmen. Carmen! You mean nothing to that moron. He only cares about himself. Hm. And I'm going to prove it. Are you really coming back with that guy instead of starting something nice with me? What if it was the other way round? So I'm the obstacle. Fuck, Lucia. What are you going to do with Playtime? I can't lie to the Germans. They'd send me to clean toilets in Frankfurt. We're going to invest in Poland. Are you helping me with this? I'll stay in Valencia, working with my family. Are you going to change a healthy company for a broken one? It's a mad house. But it's my mad house. -Does it hurt? -No, it's not my hand that hurts the most. I'm really sorry about yesterday. I've never been jealous like that. I'm sorry, too. Since it's so easy to use and so discreet... it has become a highly demanded product. It's growing spectacularly... and it doesn't face as much competition as regular toys, with which... we're no longer competitive. Once you get immersed in this world, possibilities are infinite. It's soft, so you can squeeze... -It has two holes... -A flexible glans... But it has a problem. It's disposable and costs around 15 euros. 15 euros? Isn't it too expensive? Yeah, but you just wait... Okay. In order to clean our reusable masturbator, you only need... there you go... to open it... to see the inside. Moreover... you can use... its base... to let it dry. Our prototype can be used more than sixty times. Sixty! And we can sell it for less than 100 euros. The profit margin is huge. So? What do you think? As a concept. I've listened to your proposal. Okay. Let's see. Tell me what Ferran said exactly, please. I think it's all been a mistake. It's not a mistake. The Germans are simply not interested in our company. So, please, let's focus on this right now. It's all your fault! My fault? Leave us, please. Sure. [door closes] Excuse me, Marta. We'll never produce that thing as long as I run this company. Then retire already. Let them have their way. As you should've done years ago. Sure. I'll retire, but I'll still give you the money to make plastic cunts, right? We'd pay our debts in three years. Even Lucia agrees. You'll end up alone, Abelardo. Don't you see it? Then I'll close the fucking company. Do what you want. But don't count on me. I've had enough. I'm leaving the company. Ungrateful. After all I've done for you. You were a loser. I gave you all you've got! You're really insufferable! I'll hand in my notice tomorrow. [door closes] [phone chimes] CARMEN HAS LEFT ME. I NEED TO SEE YOU. Thank you all for coming. I shall be very brief. I am going to close the company. After the latest events... and, well, given the current circumstances... it is the only thing I can do. I assume... all responsibility for... for not having been able to keep the business going these years. And now, Marta will... explain to you how we will proceed to liquidate. I wish the best of luck to all of you. Thank you. I mean it. What happened? Thank you for coming, my friend. She has left me, Toni. Well, it was to be expected. She's married, isn't she? My only consolation... is that I'm going to find her husband and smash his face in. Hey, violence isn't the solution. Besides... you don't even how his face. But I do. He's got the same motherfucker-face as you do. Look... If anyone here's got a motherfucker-face, it's you. -Wife stealer! -It's better to steal them... than to make them unhappy, don't you think? I'll go away so I don't crush your face. You can't imagine how much I wanted to do it since the day I met you. Like hell, you're going! You won't go until we've talked. Who's going to stop me? You? What are you doing? What are you going to do? Brush my hair? No, I'm gonna teach you not to screw others' wives! That's what pisses you off. That they'd sleep with others! -You're fucking selfish! -No, you're selfish! She wants to be with me, but you won't leave her! Because with me, she feels loved! If you cared, you'd let her go! I would let her go if she were in love with you, but she isn't! Has she ever told you she loves you? Has she? Has she told you? Huh? Has she? Confess! You've done it for yourself! Of course I have! But I hate that she's slept with you! -I knew it! -But I hate much more the fact that... I deprived her of love because of the fucking company! I hate not having caressed her when she asked me to. Not having told her... "I love you" when she needed it. -Do you understand? -Don't worry. When she finds out you know, she'll feel guilty and come back to you. So you'll be able to make her unhappy again. Tell her I know, and I'll burn your shop down. I want her back because she loves me! Not because she feels guilty! And if she decides to go back to you... I won't bother you ever again. I swear it. [music playing] I said everything I had to say. If you're looking for trouble, you're at the wrong place. What would you like? The same as him. Do you know what this is? No, I don't. I'm not wearing my reading glasses. You know because you took this picture. It's the first Playtime office. -[Clara] Here you are. -Thanks. I thought I'd lost it. No, I stole it from you. I remember it well because it was the day Carmen introduced me to her father. She said you were looking for someone to be in charge of the exports. And I came into your office. At that time, you already had... ...that friendly nature of yours, and said... "I don't give a fuck if you're my daughter's boyfriend." "If you want the job, you'll have to present the best business plan." And I spent the next two or three weeks barely eating or sleeping, considering all possibilities of expansion throughout Europe. Every last detail. And, half trembling... I handed in the project. You're wrong. Nobody else presented a project. You handed in the best expansion plan I could find. And, thanks to it, Playtime started making great strides abroad. Why didn't you tell me? All these years, I've been working, believing I wasn't enough, thinking, wondering... if you'd hired me because I was you daughter's boyfriend. Because I didn't want to be in you debt. Everything I have, I got it on my own. And I didn't want that to change. Look, Abelardo. I'm not here to reproach you for anything. I only want to remind you that, if I'd given my all working in your company, it was because I admired that fool... who, from a little factory in El Barranquet, covered half of the Spanish homes with toys. That's why I stole the picture. And that's why I've kept it in my wallet. Take care. [whistles] Mom, lunch is ready! -Don't smoke! -Do you want one? No, I think I'll quit. Come on, clear the table. It's hot. It look's great! I didn't know this cooking side of yours, grandpa! I can't boil an egg, but I'm the best at cooking paella. Have you seen our new catalog, grandpa? Grandpa? Don't you dare call me "grandpa"... not until you've married my Lucia. That'd be if Lucia wants him to. [laughing] -Wine? -Yes, please. [Lucia laughs] I already told you. This, I don't... I don't see it. Grandpa, it's upside down. [laughing] Oh. That's right. We've done a mail out, you know? Distribution companies all throughout Spain are waiting. You are still on time to add Playtime's logo. I already see the advertisement: "Your children are already playing. Now it's your turn to play. Playtime For Adults." You might like the other one better. "The toy the Pope would never recommend." I don't know. Negotiating behind my back? These kids haven't realized I am the honorary manager. Do you know what means? Yeah, you get all the money, but don't lift a finger. Well, he's earned it. Dear manager, what would you think if our little and humble company... were to merge with Playtime? It's hard to admit, but... for the first time, I agree with Abelardo. Erotic toys and children's toys... it's not a good idea. It's better to run separate companies. Okay, right. You'll come back to us when half of Europe is playing with our vagina. [laughing] Look, guys, I love your business initiative. I wish you the best of luck, but... as long as you are in Playtime, you'll work forty hours a week. That is final. Come on, are we here to eat a paella together? -Or to talk about...? -Yeah, come on. Mom, give me some. [music playing] YOU'RE A LUCKY MOTHERFUCKER. TAKE CARE OF HER. [music continues playing]
