(RAIN FALLING LIGHTLY) (ENGINE ZOOMING) (DOORS THUDDING) Are we really fuckin' doin' this? Yeah. We're fuckin' doin' this. We don't have a choice. There's always a choice. There's always a way we can go. We can just fuckin' run. This time, we don't have a way out. This is the moment we knew was coming. The moment we been dreading. Our backs are against the wall, but we're fuckin' doin' this. No. No, this, we don't know this fuckin' guy. I don't know this house. I don't even know what fuckin' street I'm on. I haven't eaten shit all day. You know I get all fuckin' weird with that low blood sugar. (TENSE MUSIC) This fuckin' feels off. Just relax, fuckin' relax. Oh, fuck this. We're just goin' in for a second. This guy isn't anything we have to worry about. By the way, we're on Nash Street, come on. We're goin' in. We're buyin' a quarter. Once we know he's sellin', that's it. We'll be on our way. All right. You're right. You're doin', you're doin' all the fuckin' talkin'. Hey, don't get all shy guy on me, all right? These dealers are paranoid. If they think we're narcs, they'll turn us away, or... they'll shoot us. (TENSE MUSIC) Hey, don't worry about it right now. Let's go. And I'm sorry I didn't take you to eat before this. I shoulda been thinkin' of you. (KNOCKING) (TENSE MUSIC) What's up, buds? I'm Cliff, this is my friend, Otis. What you doin' on my porch? Pete Simms told us he was gonna call ya. Said we were comin' over. Could you hook us up? Oh, fuck, 'course. Why didn't you say so, bud? Yeah, he totally called. I'll, uh... Let ya in. Welcome to the casa. CLIFF: Nice house. Oh, for sure. It's kind of an old man river of a place. AC doesn't work, little bit of a unknown stink comin' from the sink area, but you know, it's nice, right? I mean, what's the word? Quaint? No, not quaint, that's all right. I was thinkin' like, cozy. Cozy or... How 'bout rustic? No, not rustic. Rustic? Jesus, Otis. It's not a fucking cabin in the woods. There's a strip club two or three minutes from here. That pedophile man we passed right outside? How the fuck could that be rustic? I know. It's not a house, it's a pad. Fuck. Perfect. It's a great pad you got here. What'd you say your name was again? Name's Christopher. Chris, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, as well. I help you boys to some brews, here? We're in a bit of a hurry. Love one, thanks. There we go. I know we got some Moorlies, little IPA. Oh, dude, we got a shitty home brew, but it's a home brew. You drink a fuckin' home brew. So. CLIFF: All right. You guys were sent from Pete Simms. I speculate you're here for the chronic. Friend of Pete's is a friend of mine. So. I'm gonna hook you up with a sample. Now, I know how mind blowing this shit is, so, I'm gonna need to see your faces after the first puff. I don't know. We're in a bit of a hurry. We're not in that big of a hurry. There it is. Whoo! Lemme tell ya, you won't regret. Thanks. CHRIS: Yeah, it's, it's so nice. That's some seriously sweet chronic. CHRIS: Oh, for sure best stuff I've smoked, hands down. So, what do you say? (COUGHING) Could we get, could we get a quarter? Absolutely. Allow me to show you to the stash. It's downstairs. (TENSE MUSIC) Wait. Can't we just do the deal up here? Why do we have to go downstairs? That's where the stash is. Listen, you boys help yourself to whatever's in the fridge. Make yourself at home. I'm gonna go take a tinkle. I'll be right back, okay? (TENSE MUSIC) What the... I don't fuckin' like this. You said we were gonna be in and out. We know he's got the pot. Why are we goin' downstairs? Dude, relax. We have to do this deal. One joint doesn't say shit. We've gotta do this deal. We've got to see that he's got the stash. You know we've gotta go down there. So, quit bein' a pussy, and come on. No, we don't. I'm stoned out of my head. We don't have to go down there. The guy just fuckin' sniffed my face. Shut the fuck up, Otis. Pull yourself together. We've gotta go down there. Quit talkin' about all this bolting bullshit and follow me. OTIS: Fuck. Hey, oh right this way. (FOOTSTEPS THUDDING) (TENSE MUSIC) Hey guys. This strapping young man is Cliff. Cliff, Jocelyn, Klaus. Klaus is German. He's a little bit spotty with the English, but don't let that stop you from talking to him. He's fucking hilarious. And this handsome devil is Otis. I think, right, Otis? Yeah? Yeah. Anyway, Otis is not much of a talker but what he lacks in wordplay, he makes up with wicked enthusiasm and I'm tellin' ya, a penchant for bein' a lady killer, this guy. Probably a shitty poker player, though, am I right? Thanks, bud. 'Preciate that. Anyhoo, Otis, Klaus, Jocelyn. (TENSE MUSIC) Otis. Hi Jocelyn. Have a seat, bud. Finish up this joint. (TENSE MUSIC) You guys like bongs? (TENSE MUSIC) Do you mind? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CLIFF: Hey, does Klaus not smoke? CHRIS: Oh, he smokes. He's all fucked up on 'shrooms right now. CLIFF: Wait, Klaus doesn't smoke? Oh, he smokes. But he's all fucked up on 'shrooms right now. CLIFF: Hey, does Klaus not smoke? CHRIS: Oh, he smokes. But he's all fucked up on 'shrooms right now. (BABY GIGGLING) Wait, Klaus doesn't smoke? Oh, he smokes, but he's all fucked up on 'shrooms right now. (BABY SCREAMING) Oh, he smokes, all right, but he's all fucked up on a broom right now. (BABY LAUGHING) Oh, he might be a witch, the way he's ridin' a broom right now. (SWOOSHING) (BABY LAUGHING) Oh, he smokes, all right, but he's got 'shrooms pulsing in his fucking face right now. (POPPING) (BABY LAUGHING) (TENSE MUSIC) Do you ever get that feeling when you first meet someone, that maybe you've met them before? Maybe we knew each other in a past life. Maybe it was in a dream. It doesn't happen very often, and never in this way. Sometimes it's just a feeling like it was a friend or maybe Deja Vu. But with you, it is very different. I feel an energy with you. Almost an electricity. Do you feel that? Yep, I feel it. I, uh... Gotta be honest. I'm a little nervous. It's not because you're beautiful, or it's probably because you're beautiful, but I'm pretty stoned right now. Relax. Enjoy the ride. The night is only going to get weirder. All right, you're up, bud. (TENSE MUSIC) (BONG GURGLING) (COUGHING) Holy shit! It burns! Sure does, bud. That's how you know it's working. Just keep on drinkin' that beer, bud. We're gonna be all right. Oh my God. I was thinking about when you first meet someone. Like us, tonight, and you know, most of the people you meet, I don't even remember their fuckin' names, and after a few days, I forget their faces. It's almost like I never met them. But, that's life, right? People come and go. Forgetting's just a coping mechanism. But then like, with you, tonight, I feel like every so often you meet someone that you were destined to meet. Like, Fate. Yeah. Fate. You think we were meant to be. I do. Sounds crazy, but, I feel like our spirits, they've been searching for each other for who knows how long and tonight, here, they finally found each other. Need another beer, bud? OTIS: Please. Yah, be right back. You guys talkin' about? Hey. OTIS: Spirits. JOCELYN: And fate. All right. (MUMBLING) Folks like music? Thanks. Jocelyn here, and I, been known to play a bit. Call it a jam.

CHRIS: Sure do, bud. Just a couple drunk assholes at the bar. Yes, exactly, but up walks this Russian bitch. Sexiest thing you've ever seen in your life. Fat ass and without thinking, I had to say, I said goddamn! CHRIS: Goddamn. MIKE: Mmm hmm. MEHMET: Actually, she was Bulgarian. CHRIS: Even better. Well man, can we just agree this bitch had an amazing ass? Oh yeah. One in a million. Thank you, and you know Chris, when it comes to asses, I do not play because I am an ass man. You know, when I was in elementary school, all the other kids were on the slide, the swings, shit, on the fuckin' teeter totter, but not me. Wanna know why? CHRIS: Why is that, bud? 'Cause I do not play. When it comes to asses, I don't play. (FAINT ROCK MUSIC) CHRIS: All right. We get it, you don't play. MEHMET: Oh this girl, she was not amused. No, I mean, Jocelyn. If a guy's sittin' at the bar and you walk by and he says goddamn, you gonna take that as a compliment, right? Exactly. CHRIS: Ass girl doesn't like the ass compliments. MEHMET: She slapped him. She did. So, we got up and politely walked away, finished our drinks. No big deal. CHRIS: You curse out a little Philly with a nice turd cutter and proceed to get wasted, am I close? Very close. And there I am, you know, relaxing, trying to drink my cocktail in peace when... The boyfriend. MIKE: Yeah, can you believe that? I try and pay a girl a very classy compliment like that so up walks the biggest Russian dude I've ever seen. Coulda been a tranny, but my knowledge of Russian trannies is a story for another night.

This is absolutely ridiculous, but yes. You can. But why does your mother pay your bar tab? All of my money is currently wrapped up in investments or sitting in my mother's accounts. I could buy everything in this bar if I wanted to. Your finances. I work three jobs trying to just get by. You're having your mother writing checks so you can drink. Well, I guess your parents should have made better life choices. What the fuck did you say? Can I get three more shots, the total and a hundred over so I can have some spending cash? So, ladies.

(UPTEMPO ROCK MUSIC) Well, listen. There's a pretty good chance that I'm a little drunk. Maybe not a little, I'm really fucking drunk. I can vouch for that. We might have taken the attention of several Sigma Nu's at ladies' night in a shit hole bar downtown to the liberty of three to a half dozen lemon drops. I don't know why, but frat boys will take out a second student loan when you wear a shirt that almost exposes a nipple. (LAUGHING) I'm guessing that effect works on all men. Well, this here should relax everybody. These girls can be a real fuckin' headache. But they're not that bad when they're stoned. Super slutty, though. (FAINT FUNKY MUSIC) Bud. You need to take this seat. Hot seat. There. PETRA: Sorry, sorry. (FAINT FUNKY MUSIC) Go to the bars? No. The clubs? Nope. House parties. Why not? CLIFF: I don't really like people. You don't like people? But you're here, with people. Once in a while I meet someone who's not so bad. Hmm, I love people. How can you not like people? I hate people, too. No, no, no, no, no. You're lyin' bitch. We go out every fucking night. That's because I love sex. I hate the majority of people, though. CHRIS: Gotcha hater. Well, what about me? Huh, what about me? You? I'd hit it. Stop. CHRIS: Fuck yeah. All right, what's your stance on love, then, since you know, you don't like people and all. That's a tricky one. I don't think there's really a correct answer to love. I suppose I'm for it. But then, you've got those fuckin' smug couples, suburban, two stories, Range Rovers, stupid fuckin' Pinterest, decorations all over their front porch. Nah. Changed my mind. I don't love love. Okay, there's nothing wrong with Pinterest. Okay, you hate people. You don't believe in love, what's next? Are you gonna tell me you hate sex? No, no, no. Absolutely am obsessed with sex. Mmm, me too. Okay, are you more of a breast man or an ass man? Breasts, duh. You know, I don't know if it's because I'm so drunk, but I'm finding you incredibly sexy right now. You are super drunk, though. Fuck this. Jocelyn, you little porcelain hippie. Please sing a song for me. JOCELYN: Oh yeah? DANA: Mmm hmm. JOCELYN: And what would you like me to sing about? I don't know. About your great fuckin' life. JOCELYN: Oh. DANA: Somethin' that explains a little somethin' somethin'. Yeah, okay. Okay. So great, let's see, okay.

You don't like anybody, but you like him. These are good people. Just wanna fuck up their lives? I know what this is about, and don't you fuckin' lie to me. You're fallin' for that broad. That why you don't wanna go through with this? I haven't met anybody that is that amazing. I can be myself around her, and she likes it. She really likes it. I feel I can touch her, I can feel her heart. It's indescribable. Well, sorry. We're fuckin' doin' it. No. We can just run. We can leave. It's not too late. We can get the fuck outta here, and not fuck up her future, fuck up these peoples' lives. You wanna walk. No, no, no, no, no. Tonight's about to get very dark for our new friends. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) We missed another deal. How the fuck did we miss another deal? What the fuck are you doing here, Frye, all right? We just needed a dollop of evidence, just skosh, all right? We sent in the biggest ears on the mother fuckin' force and we got jack shit. Do your mother fucking job, Frye. Keep it up, Frye. You're doin' just fine. Hey, Swish. They're not talkin'. They're doin' deals, we know that, but they're just not verbalizing the exchange. So, would you just mellow out your Viagra withdrawals and let me and Frye just relax, here, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Feel like I'm babysitting a six foot tall limp dick. Six foot one, asshole. And why don't you go fuck up some other single mother's life, fuckin' prick. Hey, Frye, please don't use Detective Swisher as an example of a detective that we should all know and love. God. And just so we're all clear, I never fucked up anybody's life. I feel like it was merely a life's lesson in those women's lives that they shouldn't let an officer with bad intentions or, or insatiable sexual appetite into their lives if they're not willing to commit. Women, and their commitment issues. It's baffling. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) Oh God, I must look like a total mess right now. I, Otis, I don't know how my life got to this moment. (STAMMERING) I'm just so scared for Maija, and she must see that fear every single time I look at her, but I can't help it. She's my baby. She's the most important thing in the world to me, and I can't do anything to help her. I can't do anything to make her better. I just have to sit and watch her slowly suffer. I know that one day I'm gonna wake up and she'll be... (WEEPING) Hey, I feel the same way. I'm scared, too, but I wanna spend the rest of the time that we have with Maija watching her smile. MAIJA'S MOTHER: I'm so happy you found your way into her life. Hey, oh. Your water, Klaus. Don't need any alcohol cloudin' that trip. All right. (CLINKING) Cheers. What a night. Well, hell yeah, bud. I mean, here we are, night after night, just jammin' out, playin' our music and in walk you two, agitatin' the peace, in a good way, bud. Okay, I will tell you a part, but you can't have all of it, not tonight. Huh? My story? You still wanna hear it? Oh, yeah. Okay, try and stay with me for the journey. So... (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) DRIVER: Where are you headed, little lady? Well, headed wherever life takes me. Guess my destination is getting a bit lost for a while. All right, I'm headed 120 miles north. Wanna lift? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) So, where are you from, little lady? All over the place. I've been everywhere. All right. How long have you been on the road? A little over three years. Three years, oh my. You ain't headed any place special? You're just going? It sounds cliche, but, I needed to get away from life and start really living, you know? I like that, and you ain't running from nothin'? You didn't kill anybody did you? Not yet. I'm just joking, I'm not running away from anything. I guess I just wanted to explore the world for a while and I'm not satisfied yet. The road is a rough place, and it's gonna be especially rough on a girl like you. Yeah, I've had a few scary nights, but it's made me tough, plus, at this point, I don't think I can live with any more fear in my heart, so, my heart's at peace. This heart's wild and free. I believe you, little lady. Just take care of yourself, you hear? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (MUMBLING) (ENGINE ZOOMING) CHARLIE: Evenin'. Hi, thanks for stopping. Hey yeah, thank you so much. You're most certainly welcome. Name's Charlie, driver here goes by Catfish. Where you guys headed? We don't really have a destination, man, we're just kinda traveling, but, the next town'd be really great. Sure, I think we can help you out. Wait. Wait. What are we gonna get out of this, sweetie? SHANE: What are you doin', man? We're givin' you and your pretty girl a ride. This is a huge inconvenience for us. Don't you think we should get some sorta reward? You know, for the chivalry of it? Hey, fuck you, man. We'll wait for the next car. Fuck me? No, fuck you, you dirty fuckin' hippie. How 'bout we take your little slut for a ride? Get the fuck outta here, man. We don't want your chivalry, asshole. Asshole? (ENGINE RUMBLING) (WAVES CRASHING) (THUDDING) JOCELYN: Hey, thanks a lot. (MUMBLING) Hey, you wanna go grab us somethin' to eat and I'll go look for a place to set up our sleepin' bags? Oh, yeah. You know, this is exactly where we're supposed to be in life, eating microwave burritos and sleeping behind a gas station. Sarcasm and you are not a good mix. Sorry. (BELL RINGING) (BOTTLES CLANKING) (WRAPPER RUSTLING) (MACHINERY HUMMING) (WRAPPERS RUSTLING) Hey, how are you? Livin' my dream. Four twenty nine. (CLINKING) JOCELYN: Thanks a lot. (BELL RINGING) (TENSE MUSIC) (THUDDING) (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLING) There's my girl. Come on over, sweetie. Join the party. JOCELYN: Shane, Shane! I've always wanted to fuck a hippie slut, and your bitch of a boyfriend can watch, too. (WHIMPERING) (THUDDING) Fuck you. (TENSE MUSIC) No, no, sweetie. We're gonna fuck you. (WHIMPERING) Stop! Stop. CHARLIE: Get the fuck outta here. (WHIMPERING) (MUMBLING) Go away, you crazy fuck. (GRUNTING) (TENSE MUSIC) JOCELYN: Thank you. No need to thank me. We've all needed help. Just, Shane. Shane. Oh my God, oh my God. He's gone, I never saw him again. Yeah. Whoa. That's fuckin' incredibly crazy. What happened with you and Shane? Tonight, you only get a piece of the story. Did you just tell a story where you were saved by Jesus? Yeah. Well, cool story. How 'bout we get our noses dirty with this here bam-bam? Allow me. (SNIFFING) Yah! Hold this. (SNIFFING) Oh my God. (MUMBLING) Uh. No. Uh, thanks but, no, I'm good. Okay. (SNIFFING) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) Hey. Listen up. Yeah, you know I don't have a lot of life lessons to live. Oh hell, any sense at all, really man. I can tell you how to survive in this fucked up world for as long as possible. That's our tale for today, old buddy, survival handbook. All right, rule number one. Don't trust anybody that has anything to do with the government. Now, I'm serious, anybody okay? Don't do it. All right, they're not to be trusted. Don't even think about it, you know? It starts with the career politicians and fuckin' police and trickles down to the courts and the judges. (BELCHING) Hell son, I don't even trust the garbage men. CLIFF: No? AARON: Hell no. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (CHUCKLING) You don't trust our garbage man? No, I don't. Okay, I guess you can trust the garbage man, but only 'cause he's seen how much I drink to get by and maintain sanity in this fucked up world. You can't trust his boss, though. All right, now that we got lesson number one out of the way, lesson number two. Most people in this world don't give a fuck about you. Not your so-called friends, even your family. Hell, pretty sure all my cousins wish I was dead or disabled, I don't know. Friends? I don't have any friends. Had 'em, I don't care, all right? Some come and go, you know? Some pass on, some go the way of meth. Some of 'em became part of the problem that is the government. Dad, you're rambling on. I'm not rambling, I'm preachin'. I like my friends, Dad. What about Otis? I'm not suggestin' you gotta become a hermit there, Clifford. I'm just sayin' the good ones stick around. Hold on to those. They're gonna come and go, you know? The good ones'll stick around. (MUMBLING) Even Otis, ah that kid's weird. He'll stick to ya, like family, you know? He'd die for ya, you know that? And when you find the good ones, and they're there, you hold on to those, like a brother. I will, Dad. Any more lessons? I don't wanna try and change who you are, Cliff. I mean, why would I? You know, you're good, kid. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) I want you to go your own path, you know? Hopefully, I... you know, inspire you. Hell, it's no big secret I made a lot of mistakes. Yeah, I don't want you to, don't let me try to lead your path, you know? I just, just wanna try to give you some guidelines, that's all. Shit, maybe it oughta be called the official handbook of what not to do, huh? Dad, you're so weird. Yeah, I am weird, son, thank you. You gotta seek out the weirdos. One percent, the elite, find the weird souls. It's weird people that shaped me, made me who I am today. You know, the non-conformists that they guide and shape society. Well, here's the rule number one. Fuck society. Lessons and guidelines, Dad, sounds an awful lot like the government. AARON: Yeah, hold on to that thought there, buddy. CLIFF: Dad, what are we doin'? Don't you do it. Don't you do it, you fucking bastard, don't you... Dad, should we call the cops? No, son, we're just gonna sit here and wait. Hope nothin' happens. Sometimes in life you'll find yourself in situations where you just gotta wait, or you can run and hide or call some chicken shit cop. Or, you gotta fight. Tell your mom I love her. (TENSE MUSIC) CLIFF: Dad! Dad! (TENSE MUSIC) (SNAPPING) You all right, bud? Need to take a little break? Chris. CHRIS: What? Can you roll a joint for Cliff, please? He's gone right now, like, out of the atmosphere fuckin' gone. It's equally freaking me out and intriguing me out, but please mellow him out. All right, I got ya, bud. Hey, hey, hey. I got him, don't worry. Come on, Cliffy boy. Look, I'm not really good with words, Otis. I'm so sorry for the bad news. I know how much Maija means to you and I know, I know how much you mean to her. I guess what I'm... I'm about to fuckin' lose the only person in this world that made it feel like it was worth fightin' for. She makes me smile when I wake up. She shouldn't have made it this far, but she did. Maija. She's so fuckin' stubborn. But because of that, because she's so fuckin' stubborn, I got to meet her, care for her. I love her. She's like my little sister. I think it was no coincidence, that stubbornness was no coincidence. I think it was fate, so that I could see that life's worth fightin' for. Every day, worth dyin' for, for every moment with those you love. How long did the doctors give her? Proper medications and treatments, it'll be soon, very soon. But, there's a chance. Yeah. That's the fucked up part about this whole thing. She can survive on those medications and those goddamn treatments, but they're so fuckin' expensive. Ugh! Her mom's, her mom's broke. She sunk every dollar into her care and she's not strong enough. She's not strong enough. Hey. You wanna get high? So that's it? Yeah? (TENSE MUSIC) That's it. Look at me. Chris, look at me! What? What else are you gonna say to me? (SOMBER MUSIC) Look, this wasn't meant to be. We weren't meant to be, but that doesn't mean that I didn't love you. So you did love me? After all this, after this fucking betrayal? Are you kidding me? I loved you! You know I loved you. It just wasn't enough. I gave you my fucking heart. Fuck you! You never gave me your heart! Not all of it, anyway. How could you? You love the bottle too much! You love your fuckin' pot and your lazy-ass friends too much. Yeah. Fuck. (CLATTERING) (TENSE MUSIC) Hey, come on. Hey. Come on. Look it, I gave you everything I possibly could. It just wasn't enough. My love was not enough. You needed more. You needed someone else. You have lost me today. The love that we had, we'll never find again. But I lost you long before. I lost you to a lifestyle that I could not survive! You had the choice long ago and you could have chosen me! But you chose the bottle, you chose the high. You chose a different feeling than love! (TENSE MUSIC) Just leave! I am. I'd like to think that I'll look back on our good times, but I won't, and you won't, either. (DOOR SLAMMING) You all right, bud? Hey. Listen, I know it's not gonna heal those scars in that heart, big guy, but it's gonna soothe the pain. Just spark it up, talk about it. Relax, bud. (CLICKING) I don't think I've asked you where you live. Here? You live here? Where? Where's your room? (THUMPING) This is your bed? There's no room? Dude, this is like living in a palace for me. I was a hitchhiker. I slept on the ground outside. This, this is the life. A roof over my head, running water, and all the free drugs I want, yeah. Nice, so Chris just hooks you up whenever you want? The drugs are mine. I'm the drug dealer. Chris works for me. Holy shit. You're the pot dealer? Well, yeah. Not just pot, I sell pot, coke, 'shrooms, X and some Puerto Rican moonshine that Pepe down the street makes. Goes down smooth but kicks in like a fuckin' mule. You sell that from here? Yeah, I do. See that bag over there? I've had it for years. Keep everything in there. That's it. We got these hippies. Call backup, let's fuckin' go. Come on, Frye. We need you as backup. Frye, Frye. You're gonna need that pistol. (DOORS THUDDING) So relax, bud. We didn't get what we came here for. CHRIS: Oh fuck, you're right. Totally spaced, my bad, man. How much do you need again? We're gonna be needin' all of it. CHRIS: All of it? What? Yeah, everything you've got. CHRIS: You're fuckin' with me, right? Trippin' me out, bud. What's goin' on? Take me to your stash. I really don't want this to get messy. Turn around, go down the stairs and show me the drugs and then, we'll be on our way. You can even keep that joint, bud. (TENSE MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS THUDDING) Police! (GUNSHOT POPPING) (GURGLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (GUNSHOTS POPPING) (GUNSHOT BLASTING) (TENSE MUSIC) Swisher. Swisher! Wake up! Swisher!
