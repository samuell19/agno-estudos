She wasn't really gonna hurt him but he got so scared that he peed on himself. Who does that to a person? I'm really hoping that was a fake gun.

Burt Waldon here. I've been seeing way too much of these attention starved whore bag on my feed. I mean what the actual fuck? Congratulations, Kiya, you've made some deadbeat townie cry and piss himself while bringing joy to the lives of bumble fuck incest ridden hillbillies with your fake gun. Fake. Just like you. You're just another fame obsessed junkie trying to make the biggest splash you can before you shit out a kid and die of cancer. Here's the cold hard truth, Kiya. You're just as insignificant now as you were yesterday as you will be in a week. You're a nobody, nobody. Everything about you is fabricated because you're garbage. You're absolute garbage. Putrid, grotesque, and plague inducing. Here's my advice to you. Do us all a favor and slit your wrist. We're all running out of clean water and oil. Be the bigger person here and remember go vertical. Once cancer cells appear, they soon develop into a clump of tissue that lives at the expense of the entire body. Turn that off. Huh? I don't want that on me. Why? If you don't turn that off... You're not being safe. If I stop recording, will you get pancakes with me? Hi. Hi. Tell me a story. Story? Yeah, tell me a story. All right. This one time, I don't know, I think that one's kind of boring. Can we just, I'd rather just sit here. Nope. Actually first, if you could be any kind of animal, what kind of animal would you be? Like a? Maybe something in the water. Something big. And just floating around. Like maybe one of those big things, they swallow everything. It has fish on its back. A whale shark. That's the biggest kind of shark. Do you think you'd be a whale shark? I wouldn't mind. Okay tell me a story. I like your beard. Now tell me your story. If I tell you a story... Can we just eat after? Yeah. Give me a second here. Okay I have to pee, so you think on it. Think on it real hard, think of your best story and then I'll come back and I'll sit here and I'll drink this coffee and I'll listen. I'm really good at that. Yeah, front desk. Do you remember me? What do you mean? I checked in a couple of hours ago. Do you remember what I look like? Real pretty, young face, yeah I remember. How young? Not too young. Are you sure? Um. Do you want to fuck me? Okay, okay, okay. Can I see your face? No. I can live with that. What's going on with all the plastic? In case we make a mess. Who's that little guy? He doesn't have a name. What's the raw deal? Why did you come to my room? I don't know, I guess I feel I would've regretted it if I didn't. Regret what? Not fucking you. Take off your shirt. How old are you again? 17. 17. Is that a problem? I didn't think so. Hey, what are you, wait a minute. ♪ Interstellar Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey I'm afraid I'm gonna have to say no to the camera. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist. Turn off the fucking camera. Why? Don't you want to watch yourself fuck me on TV? Are you out of your mind? No one's going to see it but us. And whoever else you show it to. Oh yeah, are you gonna give me the tape? You bet. Then what's in the bag? Treats. Treats. Catch. Enough. That's enough. ♪ Transformation Stop. Shh. You have to finish what you started. Okay, I can eat anything. I can eat everything. ♪ Lift that Enough, enough. Enough! You're going to eat or you're going to bleed. Which is it? Fuck you. ♪ Change ♪ Change You shouldn't play with strangers, you might have too much fun. Why do you have so much stuff in your car? Why'd you shoot me? I was just having fun. Good answer. Where are your parents? What's in your trunk? - Julia. - I gotta go. Wait. Yeah? Do you wanna see what's in my trunk? Julia, come on, let's go. If I let you sit in the back, are you gonna give me any shit. Listen, I know that I might not be your favorite person right now, but let's be honest, you probably don't have the best judge of character. The way I see it is we've got a long road ahead of us and I think we'd both benefit from some good conversation. All right? Is that your motel? Yeah, basically. What do you mean basically? It was my dad's, he's dead and... Left it to me and my brother, he's dead now too. So do you live there? Yeah. I had a house but the storm took it. Amongst other things. What other things? That's a weird question. The rooms, they're really beautiful, how did you... What is this, 60 Minutes? What's 60 Minutes? I painted them. You painted them? Yeah. By yourself? By myself. What's with all the bags of spray paint? So were you in my room? Yep. When? Right after I knocked you out. What's the hardest drug you've ever taken. - Acid. - Acid. Bet you never felt anything like 97 cents in a paper bag. What's the worst thing you've ever done? You've gotta earn that. You can't just ask something like that, I don't know you, I don't know you at all. This should be more of a conversation not an interrogation. You know, a little more of a back and forth. What do you wanna know? Um, well let's start with a name, that's what two people do when they don't know each other. My name is Marshall. Kiya. It's a pleasure to meet you, Kiya. You got family? Everybody does. Where are they, your mom and dad? You like little girls? What's that about? Do you like little girls? What's that supposed to mean? Yeah, you know what, I like them when they're ripe. And I'll tell you one thing, you can't put a number on that. Nothing's that simple, nothing. Nothing. Never. I think I like you more than I thought I would. That's good, that's a good thing, right? Why didn't you name your rat? It doesn't need a name. It doesn't know the difference. That's true, but then again the name isn't for the rat, is it? Hm. Funny thing about pets. You gotta keep them from running away. I'm gonna put you back in the trunk. Why? Was it something I said? No. Next level snuff shit. Tied a man to his bed. No, no, it's not a sex thing. It could've turned into that later, I don't know. And then she force fed him until he vomited. Can you believe what we just watched? This girl's nasty. Hey I'm hungry, why don't you come over here and feed me? What the fuck is wrong with you? Obviously this is a feminazi. It back, eat that shit! I'm happy for you. You've made a friend. This is a big step. Sure you had to kidnap someone to get there, but hey we all have to start somewhere. Who raised you? Where did you come from? Were you a feral child? How did you turn into such a deplorable human being? But what I want to know above all else is how in the world have you managed to get away with all of this? I realize it's only been a few days since you held up the convenience store, but holy shit, are all cops just universally incompetent? I don't know what's more fucked. This moronic society inhabited by drooling imbeciles who consume nothing but shit. The mentally defective human lumps in charge of policing said truly imbeciles or you. A walking, narcissistic shit generating factory that feeds the dumb and the blind to fuel your ego while you ride some vapid dopamine rush. You're the epitome of what's wrong everything. A dumb, bored bitch with a cellphone and a shitty plan. Fuck everyone, they all deserve your fucking toxic brain numbing bullshit. And this is fun for me. Thanks to you, I get a front row seat to watching humanity crumble and devolve and it's all being meticulously broadcast by apes with cams. I love you, Kiya. You are my everything. You know, I gotta admit that kid, makes a whole lot of fucking sense. Hey all right, all right. Let's get the little guy. Is that my gun? So that tape of me vomiting, you put that on the internet. Yep. How many people have seen it? 964,932 the last time I checked. Almost a million people watched me vomit. Open your mouth. What's that? It's a horse tranquilizer. - Ah. - Ah. Oh my god, that smell. There's nothing like it. Can I, can I, can I, can I? Oh Jesus. Jesus. Oh God. You're gorgeous. But goodness you have a weird way. Like a... Strange wicked way. Okay. I don't know what this is. What is this thing? Hey. You're fucking with me. Marshall. Stop fighting the tranquilizer. It's for horses. I can take a horse. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. There are flying saucers. There's no doubt they are in our skies. They've been there for some time. What are we going to do about them? Who knows? Then they really are there. I thought you were convinced of that. I am. You've had contact with them. Contact, how? Radio. They speak our language? Well not quite. We receive messages from their spaceships. For awhile it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise. And now sir? Well since they first tried contact with us by radio, we've developed a language computer. A machine that breaks down any language to our own. Hey. What's with your room? My room? Swirling vortex in your ceiling. I don't know. I just stare at it. Passes the time I guess. Are you scared of me? Shit. You might be the best thing that ever happened to me. See, he knows. Okay Sally G says, OMG, a rainbow done pool out of his mouth. You should attach a GoPro to a dildo and ram it up his ass. What's a GoPro? It's a little camera. Sally G says to attach a little camera to a dildo and shove it up my ass? Sure sounds that way. How big's a GoPro? It's tiny. Well like how big? Fuck Sally G, what's next? Tim Tim, Tim Tim says, he looks like a piece of shit, he probably has AIDs. You should gut him and toss him in the river. Wear rubber gloves, faggot. You know what, fuck Tim Tim. He's got two first names. You know a lot of people are saying I should shoot you. You won't shoot him. What? This ends right here. Burt. Who? Shoot him. Answer me honestly. If you weren't you. Would you want to see me shoot you? I can't ask you. You're the guy being shot, of course you're gonna say no. You shoot me, you're fucked. They're gonna lock your ass up forever. Just go home. They'll give you community service and a book deal. You think so? Yeah, you haven't done anything that a pretty girl can't get away with. Cash out while you still have the chance to. It's for the view. What if there's more to see? Okay, are you ready? Go. Go! Bang. Marshall. I missed. - Okay, okay. - Oh shit. Okay, stay still. Wait. Marshall. - God! - Marshall. I forgot to record. You're doing great. Marshall. Marshall, talk to me. I can't. I feel weird. You have to, you have to, you're gonna pass out, talk to me. Something... Feel. Don't touch it, stop touching it, you're gonna make it worse. Shit. Jesus, pushing, something's pushing. I feel like my arm is giving birth. Marshall, you're bleeding, okay? We're gonna fix it, nothing is coming out of your arm. We need to think positive thoughts. Snow days, hedgehogs, - coming. - Coming. - Sushi. - Coming, I like sushi. I like sushi. Michael Jackson, Froot Loops, Michael Jackson eating Froot Loops, don't touch it, stop touching it. There's an eel coming out of my arm! What? There's an eel coming out of my arm. That's impossible, there's no fucking eel coming out of your arm. I can feel it, I can feel it, I can see it. Marshall, it's not an eel. Oh my god, it's a fucking eel, you have a fucking eel coming out of your arm! It is, it is, let it out, let it out! It's going, it's going! Is it going? Unfortunately in life, there are times when someone receives such a significant injury that a tourniquet may have to be applied. Hello, I'm Captain Jim Johnson and today I'm gonna show you how to apply a tourniquet. So Lisa here appears to be in quite a bit of pain and I can see that there's bleeding from the arm. So real quick, I wanna do a head to toe assessment to see if there are any more serious wounds. So Lisa, are you experiencing any pain aside from the wound in your arm? Everything is gonna be okay, Lisa. We're gonna get you help and we're gonna stop the bleeding. Take a wide bandage or some other type of cloth material and place it right above the wound. Make an overhand knot, make it tight. Next place a pen over that knot with another overhand knot. Tight. Next, rotate that pen until the bleeding stops. Just know that applying a tourniquet is a last resort and may result in Lisa losing her arm. Congratulations you may have just saved someone's life. Okay, I think we're in tourniquet territory. Good god. You are losing a lot of blood. No shit. I'm gonna end up with a stuffer for an arm if I'm lucky. Listen, get me a god damn tourniquet and bring me to a hospital. Are you experiencing any other plan besides the bullet wound? Fuck you, fuck you. Listen, I'm gonna die in this tub if you don't get your shit together. Oh shit. Things are getting really narrow. Look, you are not going to die. I am not taking you to a hospital. Just drop me off and go. Marshall. Marshall, Marshie! Marshall, shit! Marshall, Marshall. Shit! Marshall. What did I tell you? 97 cents in a paper bag. Tell me a story. Come on. You're a little shit. You got one? I guess. I'm excited. Well don't get your hopes up. It was like, um, five years ago. Everybody was waiting for the storm to hit. I thought I had enough time to board up my motel so I left my house and I left my kid there. Well it turns out, the storm rolled in early and I... I got stuck in the flood and I couldn't get back in time. The motel was under water. The house got hit pretty bad. Lift the whole roof up. It was the worst thing I ever did. She... She's probably your age now. I don't know, have you even graduated high school yet? Have you ever done this before? I can't see you. It's... It's... Hey, hey. Hey Kiya. Kiya. Huh? Do you hear traffic? A little. Do you think the front door's open. Where's the rat? Oh no. Shit, shit, shit, shit. What? - I think he ran. - He ran? Well go get him. I got him. Hey, just so you know, I could've fucked you. You're just another fame obsessed junkie trying to make the biggest splash you can before you shit out a kid and die of cancer.
