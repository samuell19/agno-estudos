Well, we’re archeology students and we’re doing a thesis on one of the old tribes from this area. Archeologists, huh? Dig up the ground and pull up old bones and shit, right? [laughter] [Zach] Yeah, that's exactly right. We pick up a bunch of bones and shit. You’re very funny boy, you know that? Anyway, we were wondering if you knew someone who could help us out. Maybe. Cost you some money though. Great! Do you think you can find someone for us today? Don’t know about today. Where do you want to go? Actually, we're going to the Ulawashi grounds, where the old camps used to be. [crack] [cards slap down] Something wrong? That area's closed. Been closed. Nobody's going to take you there. What do you mean? Means I can’t help you. Alright look… I'll give this to you. And the same to any guy who takes us there. Any takers? Is your heart pure? Will you look at this guy? Yeah. Then you will have no worries when it is torn out of your chest. No worries at all there big guy. And your friends? Yeah. Sure. Then I’ll take you then. Thank you sir. That place is bad. Nobody ever goes there. What, are we supposed to be afraid? Well we’ve heard only some of the legends. You see we’re doing a thesis on Native American Folklore. The Ulawashi tribe is quite well known, but there’s still a lot… Actually, we heard the stories about the kids in the 1970’s and how they perished. We’re only interested in the Ulawashi legends. And you find this interesting for your thesis? Yes. I can only take you close to it. I’ll drop you by some canoes on the way, but after that you’re on your own. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

So is it true nobody goes to the Ulawashi park grounds anymore? I was there to help investigators when the killings happened back in ’68. After that I... I swore I'd never go back there again. When you say killings, nobody knows what really happened to them, right? They were murdered. How, uh... How did they die? They weren’t simply killed, they were... they were destroyed. Never seen anything like it. Guess they had a lot to answer for. This is also an Indian burial ground, right? Unwanted members of the tribal community were brought here to pay for their crimes. Rapists, murderers. They were judged and punished on those grounds. Why you so afraid? I’ve got too much baggage. Done too many bad things in my life. That’s why I can’t go there. Like I said before it’s a place of judgment. Don't you worry boy. Those canoes I’m taking you to, they’ll navigate. But I’m warning you, get your business done quick and get out of there before sundown. Well, we’re planning on staying the night if that’s possible.

Now listen, you get out of there before dark. See you by 7. [Zach] Shut up. Whoa. Ha, ha, okay. It’s stable. It’s pretty stable enough. Be careful. [squealing and laughing] In the canoe.

You know it’s amazing it’s still here after the camp was built. Yeah, there should be 4 more, spread around like the four corners of a vast square. These are markers. According to ancient Ulawashi mythology, these markers were used to define an area of their land, a place that was sacred to the tribe shaman. It’s kind of like a warning. That’s right.

Also, I don’t need to remind you, but people have died here so if we do, god forbid, come across any modern items, something not related to the Ulawashi, let’s please leave it alone, okay? You pussy.

We might have to stay the night. All right, well this is us, right? Yeah, as far as I can tell. Well there’s rivers all around us. It’s kind of like an island or something. Yeah. Well see here, it looks like there’s a river shore less than a mile away from here. Than why did we take the long run here? It’s not like we had a choice Zach. I know that staying the night is not fascinating to everyone of us here, but let’s just try to get along. What do you think? All right, before the real work starts, let’s check this place out.

Yeah. It’s like really detailed. I bet it was hard like carving all these tiny letters in stone. Yeah. I need to figure out what it says. Actually, a lot of the words are similar to local tribes now so I can roughly figure out what it says. Some of the words are a little different. This is a place of judgment where no sin will be forgotten, no matter how small. Beware anyone with sins in their past cause they will find justice on these grounds. Oh, sounds kind of dramatic. It was written by a tribe shaman. It mentions something like they can make the land come alive and punish the guilty. I don’t know, some kind of equalizer of men. It seems like you put some kind of artifact in the ground like a battery or activator of some sort and then they believe that the land would become a trap for all sinners. How cool is that?
