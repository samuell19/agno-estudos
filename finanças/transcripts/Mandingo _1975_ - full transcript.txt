She ought to be worth 650. That's too much. I can't get more than seven for them in New Orleans. Shuck down your pants. Bend over. You're wasting time. He ain't got hemorrhoids. You alter some of them? My pa never altered a nigger, nor have I. On this plantation, there's no altered horse nor nigger. When the bucks run a-scared of that, I wouldn't be blaming them. This buck's Cicero, a runner. Talks a lot. Talks, preaches. Stops the others from doing. Else, he's a prime worker. Make a deal on him. Go fetch. Ah. He moves fast. A sound buck. Good for the sugar cane. Yeah. He might last 7, 8 years. 1,500 for the 3 of them. That's this one here and them two. 2,500. Done. Don't want to see another batch? No, that's enough for now. All right, mem, send them back to quarters. See that those three bucks is chained in the barn tonight. Yes, master Maxwell, sir. Back to quarters, everybody. Papa! Papa. Brownlee is the correct cognomen, is it not, sir? That is, sir. Ham, this here'’ ’s Mr. brownlee. Right charmed by the honor of your company. Well, I'm right charmed my own self. Mr. brownlee is a trader. Well, you gonna have slaves, you got to have traders. That's right. You can't eat them, and you can't plow them under. Papa. Papa, doc redfield come about big Pearl. If she has vomit or temperature, she got to be isolated. No, doc redfield, nothing like that. Well, let's see. All right, now, Pearl, breathe deep. [Moaning] Git! Git! What ails her, doc? Doc redfield's the best veterinarian anywhere around here. She a virgin? Oh. Well, I reckon. But you can't never be sure about a black wench. [Redfield] Lucy? She pure. Er I've been saving h like master Maxwell tell me. She a mandingo wench. You don't let just any buck get to her. Hmm. Big Pearl, you the only one who can tell us most certain. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well... Nothing ailing the wench-- except she cravin'-- in the bud of heat. She's hipped, plum hipped. Old doc redfield-- nothing he don't know about nigger nature, nigger symptoms. Hammond, son... You pleasure her, she'll get better. You don't... She'll fall off. I too black, master, sir. I not fitting for you. Master's duty to pleasure the wenches first time, you know that. Oh. [Pearl weeping] Pure mandingo. You got bucks, too? I'd give s3,000 for a mandingo buck. Need one to breed her. When I was your age, Hammond, there wasn't no 14-year-old virgins around falconhurst. Hammond craves the bright-skinned ones. Why ever you don't hanker for big Pearl. I do hanker, papa, it's... She's powerful musky is all. No need for musk to bother you. Just soak them good in manganade and potash water. I need some more milk. Yes, sir, master. Agamemnon, you black scoundrel, get in here, help lucrezia borgia. Tell them how many suckers you brung us, lucrezia borgia. 24, master. 24. These twins... Are two of them. She bred out now-- too old. Yes, sir, massa. I'm calling you, mem. I'm begging you to step face. Papa, don't get yourself riled now. It ain't good for your rheumatism. D I'll get master hammon to take a piece of your hide off of you. Oh, no, massa, don't hide me. Please, sir. I--i be spry. Do you have any religion for your niggers, Mr. Maxwell? Hell, no. More religions they gets, the ornerier they gets. Harder to drive. Don't worry none about their immortal souls? They ain't got no immortal souls. They gets to thinking they has souls. They gets to thinking they's as good as white folk. Mem, you reckon you got a soul? Well, a lazy, no-account, stupid, god-forsaken nigger like me can't have a soul, massa. [Laughing] Well, some folks think they got souls and go to heaven, too. Them abolitionists up north done say they's good as whites. Damn sons of bitches. Slavery was ordained by god-- by god hisself. Niggers are right happy eating, working, fornicating... Abolitionists! Cracks and loonies! Papa, papa. Interfering in other folks'’ ’ business! Papa, your rheumatism. I don't give a dam n about my rheumatism! Don't do this, don't do that! Gets worse, whatever I do or quit doing! Uh, sleeping... With one of them naked Mexican dogs... They say it drains the rheumatism right out of the man and into the dog. Yes? A nigger just as good. One of them drain off the rheumatism good as any naked dog. 'Course, you'd have to have that nigger sort of curled up around your feet, and then you got to press hard and kindly force the rheumatism right out the soles. That's right interesting. Hmm. Papa, I'm going. Lucrezia borgia, you tell Lucy to get big Pearl ready. Right glad to hear that, son. Good boy. He look like he be a right vigorous stud. He's... Shy about his leg. When he was 6 years old, a year after his ma died, a pony threw him off, stepped on his knee. Now, just do everything he say. Everything. And don't let no farts, no difference how you feel. And don't forget to say thank you, whether he gives you nothing or not. You supposed to reckon it's a prideful hour-- white master taking your first. This stuff smells awful, mama. Smells good to white noses. You know, I... Heard doc redfield talking... Say a magnated wench stay sweet smelling for two days. I be smelling like this for two days? Hush up, now. I told you not to let on you're sick. Go on, Meg, go on! All right. Lucy... Lucrezia borgia, you can go. You act like I told you, now. Yes, mama. You gonna have to help me with my boots. You glad about this, big Pearl? Big Pearl? Sure, master Hammond. Why mama say... I... What'd she say? She say... She say it'd b e right joyful. She right? Toby, you get out of here. How you all feel-- laying here chained while the white man walk about, doing his pleasure with a black girl? May actually don't hav e no feelings at all-- like that peckerwood say. Feelings like some old dumb animal how. That don't count no y'all hear me? In Africa, our people born free. That's right. Free men... Notslaves. Masters of our own selves. And of the forest and the rivers and the mountains. Y'all think that deep down, that peckerwood don't know we's as human as he is? What for, you reckon, he keep us from learning and religion and reading? 'Cause theyknow. They's a-feared that deep down we is human. Mem... You brung that copy-out page? Yeah, I got it. Show these brethren how to read. "Oh, lord... "Our god... "Others, lord... "Beside thee... "Have... Had..." Dumerdo? Doe. Dominion. Dominion. "Dominion... "Over us... "But by thee... "Only... Will we make..." March--men-- men. Men-shun. Mention. Men-chun. Be meaning "to speak of." "Mention... "Of... Thy name." [Door opens] What are you doing here, mem? Let me see what you got there. Give it to me, mem. Give it to me! Damn. You can read, can't you? And write. Who learned you, mem? It was you, huh, Cicero? Damn! Get out of here! My papa done well to sell you. Reading! You know what you can get for reading? Go on! There we go. Ahh. [Chuckles] There. O.K. You got to keep your feet pressed hard on his belly now, so the rheumatism drains right out from the sole, all right? Yes. Yes, doctor. All right. Hammond. Doc. Well, good night all. I'll do that, lucrezia. You stay curled up there, boy. Good night, doc. Good night, doc. Good night. Papa, I got to peel mem's rump. What's he done? Well, he-- he's just been getting too uppity is all. You protecting him again? What'd he do now? Papa, I catch mem reading. He can read. Reading! That dumb-ass, broke-head, nigger read-- I don't want to see! You know what old Sam tucks do with readin' niggers? Puts out an eye. Cures them good. One eye, not two. Blind, there's no damn use, but one eyes work as hard-- don't give no more trouble. No, papa, no. I'll just whup him a bit is all. 'Taint enough. That's all, papa. A larruping will do it. Then whup him fierce. Hammond, you got to cut deep, 'cause a nigger don't feel physical punishment soon as a white man. And you rub in the pimentade after. Hurts like hell, but heals the scars right clean. And tell lucrezia borgia to use fresh red pepper in the pimentade, fresh lemon, and plenty of salt. Yes, sir. Good night, papa. Plenty of salt, i say. Yes, sir. Reading. You pray for memnon tonight, massa? Ain't no use me praying for you, seeing as how you can do it for your own self. May after tomorrow-- after you been whupped. Now, git. Yes, sir, massa. Master, sir? What you want, dite? Master, I knocked up. Oh, I been looking for that. Master, when my sucker come, can'st I keep it? It's for your own good, dite. So you won't feel bad if'n we go to sell it. Now, I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, pray the lord my soul to take. Haul him up, pokey. Please. Don't want a beating. Master Hammond, please. No, please! No, please, stop! Please. Please, massa Hammond. Go on, Meg. You sure look a-funny hanging there. Shut your mouth, Meg. Now... Stand off from him-- so like-- and aim for his bottom. You get him in the legs it don't hurt him none, but don't you slam his back. Yes, sir, master. Go ahead. [Grunting beneath gag] [Smack] [Smack] [Muffled scream with every blow] [Beating continues] [Hoofbeats] You ain't doing that right. Give me that. Now, this is how you do it. [Louder muffled screams] Who the hell are you to touch my niggers? Why, cousin Hammond. Don't you recognize me? We was little ones. I'm Charles. Major woodford's son from crowfoot plantation. Cousin Charles. Come up to the house. Oh. Master's misery drain right through my belly. You lie, little buck. I still feel my rheumatism. Here. I hurt awful. Get down there. Ahh. Where's Charles? He's a-stuffin' himself with lucrezia borgia's vittles. Uh-huh. Major woodford-- Charles' pa-- is bad pressed. Charles come with a letter from him asking to borrow money. Do you have a mind to? May help. If'n you take to Charles' little sister, cousin blanche. Oh, papa, are you starting that again? It's time for us to be a-thinkin' of an heir for falconhurst. You need a white lady to give you a son with human blood-- not them suckers of yours through wenches. Pa, I wouldn't know what to do, not with no white lady. And you can't have no more wenches if'n you marry. Of course. Have them just the same. You doesn't talk about them in front of your wife, but she knows you have them. She wants you should have them. Saves her from having to submit. When she do submit, though, you keep on your shirt and drawers. Plagues a white lady almost to death to see a man naked. Not in New Orleans. Huh? Them white ladies there, i hear... They strip it all off. Every bit. Ham... You just go take a look at cousin blanche. If she ain't to your taste, we can look around at other white ladies. Major woodford-- ha ha ha-- don't get the money. [fiddler playing yankee doodle] Hello, sir. My name's Hammond Maxwell. I'm Warren Maxwell 's son. Hammond Maxwell, well, if it ain't. How's your pa? Oh, he's all crippled up with the rheumatism. Oh, that's too bad. And this here is Charles woodford, major woodford's son from crowfoot. Pleased to meet you. The pleasure's all mine, sir. Make yourself welcome, Mr. woodford. Y'all come on in. Thank you much. Tell me, does Warren still have that wench and that child? Thank you, sir. Little one ought to be big enough to breed by now. Well, that's what i come here for, sir. You got an old mandingo buck. My papa craves to borrow him that buck to breed them two wenches. But I haven't got that buck anymore. He dead. Bull gored him about three months ago, and old zucks, he died. Damn. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. My papa laid store in him. Warren Maxwell and his mandingos. They make the best fighting niggers, mandingos. I crave one for my own self. A fine one. One that can whup anybody. This is Katie and Ellen. I hope they'll be to your likin'. Suit me fine. Good night, then. Thank you. Good night. You a virgin? This one ain't, huh, Katie? Cousin Hammond, you take the virgin. I don't care for hard work. Cousin Charles, what the hell you doing kissing her on the mouth? What are you doing that for? Why, it makes a man feel good. She likes it, too, don't you, pretty wench? Yes, master. You don't like what Charles is doing? No, master. I don't like it, neither. Damn, it makes me sick. Why are you looking odd-like at me? Sneaky-like? What for? You tell me now, no fibbing. You tell me, is it my leg? No, master. J-just you strange for a white man. How do you mean strange? Caring what a white man do to a wench. Can you help me off with these boots? Yes, sir. What happened to your leg, master? No one's ever asked that straight out honest. You know, they're always pretending they don't see. Ha. I do walk bad. I thinks you walks just fine, master. Raise your head. Raise your head. Now you're looking away from me. I can't see you. Put your eyes on me. Look at me straight into my eyes. I can't, master. I craves you to do it, Ellen. Niggers don't-- don't what? Look a white man in the eyes? If you're told to do it... If asked to do it, you can do it. Ellen? Don't you be afeard. . if you don't like me, you don't have to stay I like you, sir. I want to please you. Here we have a capital woman and her three children. All in good health. What will you say for them? Give me an offer. I'll put the whole lot up for $850. $850. 850. [Man] 900! [Auctioneer] $900! They ain't worth it. Come on, let's get out of here. 610 to the gentleman in green. Do I hear 615? Look at this lovely wench, gentlemen. I got a mandingo. Pure-bred mandingo. I want to see.

Beatrix, my dear, ain't cousin Hammond the image of uncle theopolis? Uncle theopolis weren't that handsome, and uncle theopolis never looked at blanche like that. Blanche, do you think cousin Hammond is handsome? It don't matter if'n blanche thinks he's handsome. What matters is cousin Hammond thinking blanche is pretty. You see, you don't get the money if'n she ain't to his taste and he don't wed her. Oh, Charles. I heard your pa. Oh, my god! Oh, that's all right. You ain't a weddin g that Hammond. Oh, yes, I am.
