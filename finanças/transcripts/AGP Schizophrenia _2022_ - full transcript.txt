Something is wrong in this hospital. Sister. Sister... Sir...? Sister... Sir... Sister... Sister? What happened to you? Are you ok? Why are you acting so strange? Where did you two go?

Please do something and try again. I'll try Mam. - Sorry Madam. We can't do anything more. Its better if you go to the Cops. - Have an eye on her. - Hmmm I'll inform the manager. - Let him handle this further. Why are you acting like this? Sir.. - You deny us money for our Party Meeting? - That's why. I made you to vacate the whole Hospital - Be in a rental for 6 months. - You'll know my value then.

She thinks so too. Is there any proof to what the lady said. - No sir. - Ok. - Sir, Please come. Sir. - This is our torture. - Be calm. Always be kind & compassionate to all the patients & their relatives. Ok sir. Yes Mam, I'm Purushothaman. Hospital Manager. I heard what happened here. You need not have done this. There could have been some emergency to your boyfriend & he could have left without informing you. You check in your house. I'll ask them to check here. If we find him, we'll inform you. He wouldn't leave without informing me, under any circumstance. You ask them to check the entire hospital, immediately. All our hospital staff are busy in shifting. We have to shift before evening. Please understand what I'm telling you. I'm calling the cops right now. It's getting late. Sir. Please... I feel Gowtham is in some danger. Please ask them to search thoroughly. Please sir. You want to flip the hospital upside down. Get your bag & get lost. Looks like pills for Mental Disorder. This isn't mine. How it came to my bag? I'm a nutcase like you think. Don't get tensed.

Shall I bring Dr.Saranya here, the Psychiatrist? Ok. - Doctor, - Shhh... Don't tell me anything about her. I'll see her & find out. Ok Madam. What? You want to check me? Don't you think this is absurd? I'm fine. I think you all are... some... - Madam, we are - Hmmm! You are not calm. You are slipping. Why don't you get checked once? I'll call you in 10 Minutes, Sir.

Ahhhhhhh... Hello... You slept so long today? What happened? Morning. Good Morning. I called you to see if you have taken breakfast & tablets. Since you didn't pick up, I called Ashika. She told me you were still asleep. Get up now & refresh yourself. Eat breakfast. I'm on my way there. Ok Bye. Bye. Sir what happened. Nothing. Looks like sir hasn't even started eating. Did you eat? Hmmm. I did. I asked you. I did, sir. Eat this. What happened to you? Ok Give it to me. I'll eat. No no. Let her eat. I'm telling you. EAT. Bring tiffin in another plate. I had a dream last night. Since then, I'm so scared. I doubt everyone I see. What kind a dream is that? Thinking about the dream - makes me scared. - Hi What's the deal? You asked me to come right away. Did you get the Doctor's Appointment? No. Our regular Psychiatrist has tested Covid Positive. He has been admitted to the hospital We'll consult him after he is discharged from the... Let's not wait till then. Tablets are almost over. Not only that, he is quite disturbed from morning. We'll take him to some other good Psychiatrist. We'll wait and consult with the regular doctor. Why the hurry? No No. I'm not hurrying. I've been seeing the trouble he is in from the morning. That's why I'm telling this. Definitely by tomorrow, we are seeing a good doctor. Then, After Corona is under control, Govt will issue procedures. we'll follow that and open the company. Yes. Ok sir. Get all the masks, sanitisers & other items our workers will be needing. Make sure that we adhere to Govt procedures. - Ok? - Ok Sir. Famous Psychiatrist. He has good ratings too. We'll consult him. Ok. If you say so. I'm fixing the appointment. I have the number. - Good afternoon Mam. How can I help you? I need appointment to meet the doctor tomorrow. - Sorry Mam. There's no direct consultation during lockdown. - Are you interested in online consultation? Yeah. Ok. - Please mail us full patient details. - Hmmm. - Doctor will go through the files & fix the appointment. - Oh Ok. - Any doubts Mam? - No, Thanks. You guys keep talking. I'll mail your reports & come. - Okay. Question No.232 How the people we have never met & places we never visited appear in dreams? Some one has asked this. Let's answer that now. Dreams can be continuation of something that has happened, or it could be something that we wish for to happen. People who come in dreams could be known people or could be random people we might have seen sometime ago. It could appear like unknown place. It won't stick in our mind. But its something we've seen. To take it up a notch, some people could see future events or people we are yet to meet, in dreams. It's called intuition. Even if people who like you can, if they wish can come in your dream. This is called waves or telepathy. - Anjali - This uncle saved us. How did I get here? After the hospital staffs left, I was checking the building. I found you lying unconscious. how did she? Who are you kiddo? Why are you crying here? Who took you here? Are they here? No. Who took you here? My Aunt. No one is here. The kid was crying in the corridor. I took her here Mam. Uncle, Please call the Police. They must be hiding here. If they come here before the Police, we can't find Gowtham. Who? What they did? Please! Call the cops. I'll tell you later. Here, its ringing. Hello? Police Station? Someone is trying to kill us. Pooja, Pooja... This is Gowtham, Pooja. Some one has kidnapped me Pooja. I don't know what going on here. Save me Pooja. Please Pooja. Please Pooja. Please.. You... Who are you? What do you want? If you want your boyfriend alive, I need 5 crores. I don't have that much money. So what. She's your everything. You are her guardian. Transfer from her account. What are you looking at? 3 days ago, 25 crores have been deposited in her account. We know everything. Transfer from that. Wait outside for sometime. Go inside & give us what we want. Or you'll go home in pieces. You may scare the kid. Not me. Take your bag and leave. You? Seeing your actions, I don't think you care about your boyfriend. If you keep running, I'll cut your boyfriend in bit by bit to tiny pieces. You won't do anything to him till you get the money from me. Take the small girl. Let's see how she escapes. - Stop running. - Stop. Stop. - Catch her. - We shouldn't let her go. - I'm scared Ammu. - I'm scared. Catch her before she enters the room. - Catch her. - Hey. - Open the door. - Open the door. - OPEN THE DOOR. - Hey... Open. Why you said we should stop her before she enters the room? This is a server room. Not only that, important medicines, hospital documents, everything is here. So, This room has special safety lock. We can't enter without server room fingerprint access. We can enter only with server room technicians' fingerprint. Since its locked from inside now, it can be opened only from inside. Bloody idiots. Since we are shifting hospital, they left it open. Don't get angry. Think of another way. There's a CCTV Monitor inside. She can see what's going on here. If there are so many facilities, it might also have phone connection. Where are you going? Hello... Police...? Hello... Hello can you hear me? Hello... How to bring her out? Give me a second. If you don't come out, I'll break the door & come in. Hit hard. Harder. - I'm scared Ammu. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to you. I'll make you come out. Hit harder. Break it. The door is made of steel. It's not breaking. Go back. Go back. - Ammu, I'm scared. I can't anymore. When we kidnapped her boyfriend, we should have taken her too. We miscalculated that kidnapping him alone would get it done. What do we do now? Super...! - Ammu... Why is uncle tied up? Gowtham... Gowtham... Sorry for the inconvenience. No problem Doctor. We're lucky to get your appointment. See Mr.Gowtham. I saw your medical records. Medicines will cure only 25% Remaining 75% depends on your mental activity. I'll change the tablets that you've been taking. I feel it's overdose. May be when you started, it would have been necessary. Otherwise, to keep your mind free concentrate on various activities. You should feel fresh. Otherwise, mind will think about unwanted things. The things you want to forget, will get reminded. Though it's Covid time, instead of being stuck in the same place, travel to wherever it safer to go. Keep travelling. - Do yoga & meditation. Whoever makes you happy, & make you forget your worries, spend most of your time with them. You'll feel better. Okay? - I'll mail you the tablets. - Hmmm. We'll meet in next counselling. - Thank you Doctor. - Thank you. Are the dreams disappearing? Darkness is taking over the bright light. Let's move the clouds. Let's Go. As the sun is coming up, rise up with confidence, dear friend. Battlefield... Let's face it. Our life... Sir? Let's take it back. What happened? Rise up... Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... Grief will break you if you are fragile. Spiders will spin a web around you. How will the journey begin if your legs are relaxing? Fight your way up, the path will find you, dear friend. Rise up, rise again as you fall. Chop the betrayal and discard it. If you have a brave heart, that's the silver lining, C'mon. For the Earth, losing is not a burden. Without bending, arrows ain't flying. Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... Battlefield... Let's face it. Our life... Let's take it back. Rise up... Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... Let's fly without wings. Let's start ourselves. Face it fearlessly, my friend... This is the guy. Hey.. Stop the bike. - Who are you? - Boss asked me to bring you. - Who's your Boss? How can you not know Kasi? Get on the bike. - Kasi's men? - Get on it. - Shall we go? - Let's go. - Please forgive me. - Please spare my family. Hey! Spare no one in his family. Kill everyone. Welcome Sir. You don't seem to come by yourself. That's why, I had you brought to me. Sir, I told you over phone, right? Companies are in shutdown due to Corona. Only if company runs, i can make some commission & settle your dues. Yeah but then, you could have paid the interest at least. This could be avoided. I just told you. There's no transaction at all. You say there's no transactions. Even in this corona period, you are busy at clubs & parties. I saw all this & had you brought to me. What do you say now? Please give me just 2 weeks. My MD has some mental issues. I was planning to exploit it But before that, some girl entered the picture & spoilt it. This time I'll somehow get the money I'll pay you the principal & interest together. Please! - Please, Please, Please - Ok. If you don't pay me back It won't be the just the bike next time, you'll also be gone with the bike. Keep your word. - Shit... - Were you expecting someone else? - You asked to see office records. Did Priya message or call you? No sir. Why? Nothing. She said there's some important official work & she would call me after 2 days. I'm expecting her call from morning. Phone's not connecting. She didn't see the message also. Shall I go directly & check? That won't be necessary. What's your take on her? Very good character Sir. I think, ever since you started meeting her there are so many changes in you. I feel the same way too. Life long, if I travel with her, I think I would be very happy. But I don't know how to tell her or or if I say, I don't know how she would take it. Sir, I think she would feel the same way you do. When you meet her today, tell her what's on your mind. I shouldn't rush in this, I feel. Because, everyone I ever loved, left me alone & went away. Another abandonment, I can't definitely take it Mothis. So, Let the right time come. Ok Mothis. I'll see the files & call you later. - Ok Sir. - Ok. Bye Mothis. Why Priya is not picking up the call? Boss. He's torturing the girl who works for him saying he loves her. She came to us crying. Her brother is my friend. Ask this guy to back off. Hey... You have a daughter who's old enough to be married. Why this love nonsense now? You... Will you say you love her again? This is true love. Like "Mudhal Mariyathai" Sivaji & Radha. As long as I see her & hear her voice that's enough for me. What are you man? You are jealous of me. Who's this guy? Boss. He's a still photographer in cinema. He borrowed money for the camera. He's dodging us for interest for 3 months now. Why? There's no shooting due to Corona. I'll pay when it resumes. Ok get out now. Hey stop. Sir? - Do you know to take photos? - Yes sir. - Here. Take some. - Sir. Keep that with you. Take a look at this. - It's excellant. - Sir, forego 2 month interest? You do one thing. Till shooting resumes, come here daily. Shoot everything I'm doing. - I'm dead. Facebook, Twitter Make it go viral. - Ok Boss. Ok Boss. - We'll do Boss. - Why has he come now? What dude? You asked for 2 weeks time & you're back in 2 days! got the money already? You should kidnap a girl like you kidnapped me. Police will arrest us. You'll escape from paying us back. Is that your plan? Why are you saying like that? I let you talk. Shouldn't have been easy on you. Listen to me for a second. Decide whatever you want after that. Sir... Thing is... - Hey take him - Come with me. - Take him too. I told you there's a girl in my MD's life right? My MD is in love with her. He can't live without her. We'll kidnap her & ask for 30 lakhs. In his condition, he won't go to the cops. You'll get the money easily. I borrowed 10 Lakhs from you. Take that & another 10 for this kidnapping. 10 for me. Deal? It all sounds nice. But this involves a girl. I'm a loan shark. Interest, Principal. That's our life. We kidnap only the defaulters like you. & Get our money back. What you propose is, totally different ball game. What if the girl's relatives come our way? Sir. She doesn't have anyone at all. It'll be easy. - can he be trusted? Don't think too much sir. I'll tell you when the right time comes. Ok? You told you'll kill me? Why are you wasting your energy? Gowtham. Keep hitting him till she comes out. Hit him. Hit him. Gowtham. Are you not gonna come out? - Please don't beat him. I'm ok. Don't give them the money. - you're ok? - Bring it. Hit him. Gowtham. Don't hit him. Please. Thrash him. harder. Hit him. Pooja. I'm ok. Don't give them the money. Gowtham. Don't give the money.

You're ok? I'll take another tooth out. say you're ok then. Open your mouth. C'mon... Come pluck it. pull it out. I'll show you. Gowtham. Come out or I'll break his other leg. You're quite brave.

Hello. See if the money has come. Hahaha. Super... We've got the money. Let's leave. Go Go Go. Gowtham. Gowtham. If I have managed to not get caught by them, All this wouldn't have happened Pooja. Its all my fault. Sorry Pooja. Sorry Pooja... We've to get out quick. Let's get outta here quick Pooja. I don't think this is over yet. What are you saying Gowtham? They'll come back definitely. They left us alive in the excitement that they got the money Pooja. If we go out & complain, that's enough. Wait, let me take a look. It's locked. We'll go that side. If we get outta here, they won't be able to do anything. Something big went down. I got a message saying money is locked. We should catch them before they leave the hospital. - Run run run. - they might escape. - Sorry. Hello. We've kidnapped your girlfriend. What? Don't interrupt. - Hello. - Listen to me clearly.

No. Have you seen them before? Anyone? Any where? No. I haven't. Sorry. If you haven't met me, you wouldn't be in this situation. I don't think so. I think since you became close to me you are in harm's way. That's what I feel. Wipe your tears. Think of it as a bad dream and, forget it. Sir, stop the car. Why? Stop, I'll tell you. What? Sir, This is the right time. Confess your love to her. How will I do it now? You didn't care about the money, & saved her from a huge danger. Her respect towards you would have gone up even more. Don't think about anything. I'll take an Auto from here. You carry on Sir. Go on. Best of luck, Sir. Ok. See you later. - I'll leave then. - Ok sir. - You be safe. I'll be ok. - Can you take me to Chettipalayam Quarry? - Hop in. - C'mon bro. Are you shocked? We've become business partners. Welcome Boss. Welcome. - Shake my hand first. Why are you stunned? I was like you too. Shocked. Don't let him go Dont leave him Boss. Tie him up, tie him. Kneel down. Kneel... Boss... Come take a look at this. Lady. We've been told you were kidnapped. You look comfy like you are in a mall! Who are you? Who told you I was kidnapped? We cant reveal that to you. You should listen to what I tell you. They didn't kidnap you. I did. Till we get the money, stay put & be silent. Keep sipping that juice. Understood? Oh... No juice left? I don't know if there's a shop nearby. Don't worry. - I'll send the guys. to get you juice. Hey... Get the girl some juice. What? Look there Boss. Lady, Don't shoot. Lady, Don't shoot. Lady, Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Now tell me. Who are you? How you got here? Don't shoot me Lady. I'll tell you. It's the manager. He told me to kidnap you. Doctor, Do whatever you want. No problem. Make sure the dose is heavy. He shouldn't be cured any time soon. Let it run for some time. Hey Brother... I told you there's a new girl in my MD's life, right? We'll kidnap her & demand 30 Lakhs. 10 for me. Deal? - She goes to the beauty parlour at 11. - Dance Class at 4 PM - then she goes to Aerobics class. You go there before we do, & take the girl in your custody. We won't get a better chance than this. He has done so much behind my back! I'll deal with him later. What to do with these guys? Don't kill us. We didn't come here. We didn't see you. We'll tell the Manager that we got a flat tyre. Boys, tell her. - Please let us go - Let this deal go on as per their plan. After the deal, you'll kill us, & escape with the money. We won't kill you. Now on, we are business partners. Kidding. Business partners? You are gonna kill me? You are not gonna die. She will. Our team's job is, we'll identify rich and lonely people we'll get close to them & trick them into giving us whatever they have. This usually ends with a kidnap drama. But recently, it ended in a murder. Hey come here. There's only 10 Lakhs? Where's the other 5 Lakhs? This is all I got. Please, take this & let her go. Don't beg here. Get lost. Get outta here. Let her go. Go to the car. I'll shoot you if you come closer Take the gun. shoot if anyone comes closer. Get down. GET DOWN. Hey, what happened? Get down. We're all the same team. Get down. We decided to lay low. For a while. Your MD fell in a trap we didn't even set. Sir. Sir. On our enquiry, we found out he's very rich. We decided to settle once & for all Priya was supposed to act like she's in love with him. But she really fell in love with your MD. The amount we fixed for your MD is 75 Lakhs. Her share is 25 Lakhs. She told us to take 50 Lakhs & finish the deal as she wanted to get married to him. So what partner? She got us the money right? Why should she die? As per our team rules, in our drama, there's no room for any sentiments. She abandoned us today. What if she betray us tomorrow? That's why, I poisoned her juice. Why are you still worrying about what happened? To be honest, I have no regrets about the money. I'm happy that you are back safe. Really. Morning, I called you to tell something really important. But, so many things happened since then. May be, that wasn't a good time. This will be with me always. Reminds me of my Mom. From now, you are my everything. Priya. Priya. What happened Priya? Priya.
