Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges you, Your Majesty, and Grand Duke Vytautas to mortal combat. And to strengthen your courage, which you so clearly lack, he sends you these two unsheathed swords. KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER A ZRF Studio Production Screenplay based on the novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz by Jerzy Stawiriski and Aleksander Ford. Dramatic consultant: Leon Kruczkowski Dialogues by Leon Kruczkowski and Aleksander Ford Starring: Director of photography: Mieczysraw Jahoda Music by Kazimierz Serocki Production Manager: Zygmunt Krol Directed by Aleksander Ford Where are you headed? Who are you? Out of the way! Show respect! Don't you recognize Master Jurand of Spychow? Master, save us. We are merchants. We were carrying grain from the mill. They broke the law issued by the Order. Trade is allowed only with the permission of the pious commander Siegfried de Löwe. This is my land. Let them go. Out of the way! Out of the way! Pious commander, we stopped Polish merchants with grain. We were attacked. - By whom? - Jurand of Spychow. Father, let us... Pull! Fire! Fire! Danuska! Danuska! Danuska! Close the gate! Close it! Rain! Rain! Thank you, Lord, for saving us. Open the gate! Teutonic knights! - Are you Jurand's wife? - I am the wife of the master of Spychow. Defend yourself! My God! Mother. Mother... I shall avenge you, my love. I shall avenge you. Inn-keeper! Clear the tables and bring more light. Her Grace, the Duchess Anna Danuta will stop here for a rest. Magda, Magda, clear the tables. Away with you! GO away, You beggars! This is too grand company for us. Let's go. Sit down, boy. It's not too grand for us. You are a nobleman. Danuska! Cheer our hearts with the song, the one we've heard before. If I had wings like a goose I would have flown after my boy... - Who is it? - A lady in waiting to our Duchess. What is the name of that angel? Danusia, daughter of Jurand of Spychow, an orphan. Isn't Jurand alive? Her mother was murdered by the Teutonic Knights. By Whom? Jurand was hunting when the Germans attacked Spychow. A knight with peacock feathers on his helmet caught her neck in a rope and strangled her. ...look, dear boy, at a poor orphan... This is Danusia's knight. But return our sweet singer to us. Thank you. As you said, Your Ladyship, I want to swear loyalty to this young lady. You want her to be your lady? Who are you? My nephew, Your Grace, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec. - And who are you, my lord? - Macko of Bogdaniec. We are on our way back from Lithuania, where we fought under the command of your brother, Grand Duke Vytautas. - You were wounded? - Yes, but we won mighty spoils. Aren't you just boasting? Show us your spoils. We struck a deal with the knights of distant Frisia. Whoever wins, takes the enemy's carts and armor. We got some nice armor and a handsome doublet for my nephew. Do you want him for your knight, Danusia? I do. Then here is my chivalric pledge. I will tear not one but several peacock feathers from Teutonic helmets and cast them at your feet. - You're a fool, boy. - I've made a pledge. You won't get spoils unless you fight the Tatars with Duke Vytautis. I've made a pledge. I won't find Teutonic knights to fight among the Tatars. But you will find slaves there. Who will work the fields in Bogdaniec, who will clear the forest? - I've made a pledge. - Because you're a fool! One Duchess poisoned her husband and got an indulgence. We have the money, you can buy one. I've made a pledge. Where will you find those peacock feathers now? Where? Defend yourself! You're mad! This the Grand Master's envoy to His Majesty the King. - Who are you? - Powaia of Taczew, you fool. You've insulted the majesty of the King. You'll pay with your head! Welcome, the Duke and Duchess of Masovia. Welcome, my dear brother Lengvenis, duke of Mstsislav and Novgorod. Welcome, noble envoys of the Grand Master. Welcome, reverend fathers. Welcome, all guests to our Cracow court. Boyars, Ruthenian and Polish knights. Beg the King for mercy. It is in his power to pardon you or send you to your death. This wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk. - You don't drink, Your Majesty? - Only spring water. You set a good example, Your Majesty. Noble acts are an even better example. This is what you do, Your Majesty. The Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights Of Saint Mary's Hospital in Jerusalem High Most Reverend Grace has chosen to inform Your Majesty with all due respect and reverence, that not only Lithuanians but also many Poles are helping the rebellious pagans of Samogitia. Our men, Ruthenian merchants and nobility, complain that the Order forcefully cuts them off from the sea when they travel to sell their grain. We were given the privileges from the Holy Father. His Holiness Urban IV allowed the Teutonic Knights to trade in agricultural produce but not for gain. As monks we took vows of poverty, but our Order is forced to wage wars against pagans. The Order builds castles and mills. Who can say that in the lands of the Order there is no order and fear of God? Order and fear of God in your lands. And fire and murder at your borders. But we have respect for Christian laws, we do not attack envoys. Who do you mean, commander? Has anyone offended you here in Poland? It was me, Your Majesty. The Teutonic knight demands punishment, let there be punishment, but Zbyszko is the last of his family. When he is gone, there will be nothing left of us. Let me, my lord, give my head for his crime. Justice is not a dragon, that doesn't care whose blood it drinks. Only the guilty one will be punished. And Teutonic justice? Samogitia, sharp swords, robbery. - They have privileges. - We should attack them! You want spoils. We will not risk a war against the Teutonic Knights. So you want to chop my nephew's head off? Yes. We shall act in accordance with the law. Beg Lichtenstein, only he can show mercy. It is true, I was wearing armor. You could have defended yourself, my lord. But this armor is only worn for official visits. This metal provides no protection in a fight. Did you intend to kill knight von Lichtenstein? I did. How else could I have gotten his feathers? But I shouted at him from afar to defend himself. Had he answered that he was an envoy I would have left him in peace. True! Why didn't he call? Can you swear by the Passion of our Lord, that you did not see the coat and the cross on it? I can't. I would have never attacked one of our knights. I knew he was a knight of the Order. Would have a knight of the Order come so close to Cracow if he wasn't an envoy? Or a member of an envoy's retinue? Kuno von Lichtenstein, - Show mercy. - Mercy. I forgive him with all my heart, with all my soul, as a servant of Christ and a monk. - Glory, glory! - But I am an envoy. He that attacks an envoy, attacks the Order, and he who offends the Order, offends Christ. This I cannot forgive. Kneel. God, have mercy. The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is hereby sentenced to beheading by sword. Danuska! Rejoice, for the Castellan has agreed to delay your execution. - What difference does it make? - Don't you feel sad? A week earlier or a week later. - How is it outside? - The sun is shining. God in Heaven, oh to be in the saddle and to just ride across the fields. - You do feel sad. - Will you sing for me? If I had wings like a goose I would have flown after my boy... If I could be saved, my girl. It's time to go. The Duchess sent a letter to the Grand Master. If the Grand Master relents, the King will show his mercy. Macko took the letter to Malbork. I hope he makes it in time. Stop! He isn't a Saracen. Are you Christian? As a knight should be. And you are a robber. I'm Fulko de Lorche of Lorraine. At the Order's service against Muslims. I thought there were no fools in Lorraine. Saracens here? You fool, we've been Christians for centuries. And what about Masurians? You take me for a fool? I've seen Masurian wooden idols many times. Let me finish him off, my lord, he's a Mazurian. - To arms! It's Jurand! - Kill the Teutons! Help me! Jesus Christ! Help! Help me! Spare him. He's not a Teuton. - He fought against us. - And who are you? Macko of Bogdaniec. Whom should I thank for help? I am Jurand of Spychow. Jesus. Who are you? De Bergov, you must have heard of me. The pious commander of Szczytno will pay my ransom. This is Spychow. - You are Jurand. - I take no ransom. No Teutonic knight has ever left this castle alive. To the dungeons. Put him in chains. And this one, my lord? - I am Count de Lorche. - He is not a Teutonic knight. He came from Lorraine in search of Saracens. - You promised him to me, my lord. - What will you do with him? My nephew's life lies in the Grand Master's hands. I was riding to Malbork with a letter from our Duchess, and he wounded me. He should pay for this. A shard of the spear is stuck in your breast, you will not live long. To hell with it! I must be off to Cracow. So I must die. The executioner will have me. I guess so, but do not worry. I've ordered you a coffin made of oak wood. So exquisite that it is fit for a king. And I won't allow them to cut your head on the same cloth, on which they behead townsmen. I've already made a deal with merchant Amiley. The cloth will be brand new and scarlet. And good enough for the lining of the King's coat. And I will have a mass sung for you. May God reward you. - Uncle. - What now? Promise me one more thing. What? When they cut off my head, you must find yourself a decent wife. What? You must be delirious. You said it yourself, our family must not die out. Look. Can you see it? You're still spitting blood? A shard of a spear is stuck between my ribs. I'll be dead before winter. But you can save yourself. - What are you saying? - Have you heard about Duke Witold? When he was imprisoned in Krewo, he left the dungeons in women's clothes. Put on myjacket and my hood and go. Take this. It's a ransom for the Lorrainer, de Lorche. The Teutonic knights paid it. And they will cut your head off for me. And may they enjoy it. I'll be dead in three weeks' time, anyway. Take it! - I won't do it. - You should have never been born! It wasn't a disgrace for the Duke to escape, it won't be for you. Duke Vytautas is a great lord. He was crowned by the King. He has riches and power. As a poor nobleman, all I have is my honor. Don't you understand that I love you so much that I won't let you die for me? Damn those Teutons, if we have to kill our youngsters for them. Shame! Shame! Stop! Stop! Not to the executioner he belongs but to me! He is mine, only mine! She threw her scarf on his head. It's an old tradition, now he belongs to her. To the castle! To the Castellan! Pagan country, pagan traditions. It's true, that such a tradition exists but it is usually applied to the robbers and common folk. That's not true! Ask father Stanislaw, he knows about laws and traditions. We must ask the Grand Master. It was his envoy who was offended. Popular traditions become the law. - Free Zbyszko! - Shame! They must be betrothed at once, your Grace, if we are to honor this tradition. Your Grace, accept these humble gifts, as a truly Christian prince and a friend of our Order. Grand Commander, pay no attention to minor quarrels and misunderstandings, or to thoughtless and rash actions of young gentlemen. Reassure the Grand Master, that we are his true friends and defenders of the common faith. The pious commander, Siegfried de Löwe from Szczytno would like to make a complaint to Your Grace and it is not about a young gentleman. Jurand of Spychow, Your Grace, attacked our people. Many were killed or wounded in the most inhumane way. Brother de Bergov was taken prisoner. We brought here a noble witness, Sir Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine, who is a guest of the Order and who was also harmed by Jurand. Who is this most beautiful girl in the world? Enchanting. She is the daughter of the man who wanted to murder you. - Jurand's daughter. - Hot blood like her father's. - I would like to wage a war against her. - Border quarrels. The pious de Löwe complains of the master of Spychow, and the noble Jurand complains of the commander from Szczytno. It's not the only complaint we would like you to consider, Your Grace. The Grand Master would like to know your opinion on the King's alliance with pagans. Some even say he sympathizes with the Ruthenian heretics. The Grand Master sends you this holy relic, which her Grace asked for. The forefinger of Saint Humphrey, who died a martyr's death at the hands of pagans. I told you this mission will be as futile as our talks in Cracow. You do not believe, my lord, that the duke is on our side? - But he will not give us Jurand. - Jurand will come knocking on your gate. What did you say, my son? I said, father, that Jurand will come begging on his knees to get his daughter back. I don't understand. You want to kidnap Jurand's daughter? She is the daughter of a sworn enemy of the Order. You have had the opportunity to see it for yourself. And what about chivalric honor, the chivalric code? Our vocation makes us live on the border, in the forests. It's an eye for an eye here or you die. Listen, she is only a child. Don't make me warn them. - This you will not do, my lord. - I shall, so help me God... - Finish him off. - There's no need to when I strike. Ride on, my lord, I'll catch up with you. Forgive him his sins, Christ, bring salvation to his soul. Why, oh Christ, must we commit so many crimes to defend your name and extend your reign? I won't make it home... - Water! - Wild horses! Into the forest! Stop! Stop! You shouldn't have intervened. I would have managed on my own. - Hlawa, take the horse. - Zych! Zych! My God! So you came back to your Bogdaniec. - I did, I did, but only to die. - What happened to you? Jagna, this is our neighbour, Macko of Bogdaniec. Come here. And who is this? - You didn't recognize Zbyszko? - Zbyszko? Zbyszko. Jagna, come near. Come here. Kiss him. You grew up together. Father, how long do I have? I've tried to remove the shard but it won't budge. It won't budge... Zych! - What is it, brother? - How much land do you have? Three villages, some fifty serfs. And Jagna? How old is she? She is so drawn to boys that it's enough for her to see one to get all excited. Zych, you lie, you have some seventy serfs. - Why do you care? - Zbyszko can marry your Jagna. Confess your sins while there is still time. Tell me the truth as before God, how many serfs do you have? - Jesus Christ. - Our Father... Will he make it, sir? It's in God's hands. But the father says it might be worth trying some bear fat. Hlawa, did you bring bear's fat? I did not, my lady, the dogs ate it all. I'll go at night to our beehives, people say it's easy to find a bear there. That's a dangerous hunt, at least take our servant, Hlawa. So he can scare the bear away? No. God have mercy on us all. Use your axe. - Who are you? - Jagienka. Thank you. God knows what would have happened had you not come. Don't mention it. One of our servants came here once with an axe and a pitchfork and a bear tore him to pieces. So I followed you. - It was you I saw behind that pine? - Me. There is no other girl like you in the whole wide world. - You should fight in the wars. - Don't laugh at me. Since we are here, we can catch a beaver. For when the bear fat opens the wound, beaver's fat will be needed to close it. It'll heal immediately. - Where can we find beavers? - Follow me. Did you hear me sing while you waited for the bear? - That was you? - Yes. This forest belongs to Cztan of Rogow. - The one who wants to marry you? - He would if I'd let him. And I heard that he plans something against Wilk, your other neighbor, who would also like to marry you. He would, it's true. - Foolish men. - Why? One of them should have invaded Zgorzelice when your father was away and taken you by force. What could your father do if he found you with a baby upon his return. I'd like to see them try. Don't I have a spear or a crossbow? I would chase them back home and invade their villages myself. You know if I were Cztan or Wilk, I would not fear either your father or you. - But I would take you. - You would. A girl shouldn't be fighting men when it's time for her to get married. Leave me alone. The beavers are there. ' Got it! - I will go and fetch it. - Don't. There are several meters of mud there. If you don't know your way you may easily drown. - So how will you get it? - Don't you worry, let's go. I left my arrow-heads by the willow tree, wait for me here. - You're a beauty. - Go away! Wring my braid out. And I was waiting here like a fool. Should I have undressed in your presence? What miracles I would have seen... - Take the beaver. - Give it to me. - Zbyszko. .. - Yes? I will marry neither Cztan, nor Wilk. May God give you the best husband. You'll be a good wife. In two more weeks Macko will be back on his horse. I just can't wait. I've been here too long already. - Why is it so? - Has no one told you about Danusia? I heard some stories. She covered you with her scarf... I know, every knight makes a pledge, even the married ones. - So what about that Danusia? - I'll tell you like I would my own sister. I will follow her to the ends of the earth. I will fulfill my pledge, unless I die. - Is it true? - It is. I didn't realize. Hlawa! May God repay you for all your help. Hlawa will help you with the bear, I'm going home. What the blazes... Who killed him? Wait. - He's still breathing. - Not for long. We will help him. If he gets better it will only be a problem for us. Now we get his purse and sword. We will get the purse anyway, if we save his life. Think of our souls. We can save a Christian. Let's take him. You're a fool. It will be nothing but trouble. Maybe he will survive. A letter to Her Grace from the master of Spychow. Nothing but bad news... A part of the castle in Spychow burned down. Jesus! Father Kaleb writes that the master may still recover but his only eye was badly affected by the fire and blindness is upon him. So the master of Spychow recalls Danusia to his side for he wishes to see her before he succumbs to darkness. He humbly thanks Your Grace for raising Danusia like a daughter and, though blind, he'll visit Your Grace at Christmas to fall at your feet and ask for your care of Danusia to continue in the years to come. Come closer. I don't know you. Why didn't Tolima come? He was wounded in the last skirmish with the Teutonic knights. Our lord asks the young lady to come at once for he may turn blind any time now. Your Grace, we would like to go back as soon as the horses have rested. We'll meet those neighbors of yours in Krzesnia. - Point them out to me. - I will, Zbyszko. What do they do when they approach you in front of the church? - They serve me as well as they can. - But not today, understand? Look at what miracles he performs for you! It's them. - What now? - Now what? - We shall get him... - You mean to attack him in the church? Not in the church, but after the mass. Remember what her father said? If there is a fight, he will chase us both away. Otherwise I would have broken your ribs long ago. Or I yours. - Let's get him together. - After the mass! Hurry UP- - Damn him! - Let's go to the inn. I forgot to order a mass for my uncle's health, I'll go back. Don't. We'll send someone when we get back. - I must. - Godspeed. If either of you two claims that lady Danusia of Spychow is not the most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the world, then I demand satisfaction in a duel. - To the death. - How can it be? You scoundrel, so Jagienka isn't the most beautiful? He mocks us! So that's the kind of knights you are. - Praise the Lord. - Till Kingdom come. Where is Zbyszko? He went back to the church to request a mass. Shouldn't we send someone after him? - What for? - To stop the fight. What fight? Who is he going to fight? Cztan and Wilk, for me. So let them fight. That was quick. - What happened? - Nothing. I requested a mass. - Did you stop by the inn? - I did. - And what? - And that is all. Now that you are better I must go to the court of Masovia. - To Danusia. - I've made a pledge. - You promised her peacock feathers. - Dad! I promised to marry her. May God give you health and all the best. - Praise the Lord. - Till Kingdom come. - I'm your servant, my lord. - My servant? Miss Jagienka gave me to you. Go back and thank her for her kindness because I don't want you. I will not go, my lord. I'm a prisoner of war and I was given to you. So you belong to me. - I do, my lord. - I order you to go back. Miss Jagienka sends this as well. Go away or I'll break your bones. - What is your name? - In Czech it is Hlawa which means Head. Give me the cloak. Christians, save a servant of God. Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God. - Who are you? - My horse ran away. I was left alone without any weapon. Soon wolves will come out of the forest. - I'll die if you won't help me. - Give him a horse. May God multiply your victories, valiant knight. Inn-keeper, we want to rest here and warm ourselves up. Welcome, travelers. Off with you. I will freeze to death, my lord, ask for a bottle of wine. For a gulp or two I'll give you indulgence for a month of purgatory. He looks like a drunkard to me. Watch out or you will burn in hell for eternity. You are talking to a man who last Easter shared hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father. How can you give pardons if you took no holy orders? I have permission to sell indulgences and holy relics. - Where are you from? - From Malbork in Prussia. You can't be German, you speak Polish so well. - What is your name? - But I'm German. I am called Sanderus, and I was born in Thorn, everybody speaks Polish there, even the Teutonic knights understand it. - Bring us some mulled beer. - Have you visited Malbork recently? Not really, I went to the Holy Land, from there I went to Malbork and now I sell holy relics and indulgences, which pious Christians buy to save their souls. And where do you get those holy relics from? I have various indulgences. For five hundred years, and for three hundred and even cheaper ones so that poor people can also buy some and shorten their suffering in purgatory. I have indulgences for past and future sins. Don't think that I keep all the money I get. I don't! I'm satisfied with some stale bread and water. The rest of the money I take to Rome. It is collected there to pay for a new crusade one day. And these holy relics, any important ones? So important that one needs to take off his hat while talking about them. I have here... a hoof of the donkey on which the Holy Family escaped to Egypt. I have a feather from the wings of the Archangel Gabriel, which he lost during Annunciation. I have the oil in which pagans boiled Saint John. A rung of the ladder Jacob dreamt about and an ampoule of the wind that blew in Bethlehem. Is it any better outside? Not at all, it seems we will have to spend Christmas Eve here. Saddle the horses. We're leaving. This is dangerous, my lord, the roads are covered with snow. I have to be at the Masovia court for Christmas Eve. They will wait, my lord. We may get lost and die miserably. You may stay here, drunkard. I can't! Who else will protect my holy wares? Don't go, my lord. - We've lost the way! - Didn't I say so? - Let's keep going! - The horses won't go any further! It's bad! I can't see the road! There is a man in the snow. My lord! My lord! We'll die under the snow! My lord! My mm! We'll die under the snow! - Light! Give me light! - Someone's there! Is anybody out there? Who are you? The Duke of Masovia sent us to help lost travelers. Come with me. There are people under the snow. Help! - It's Jurand! - A torch! Warm him up! Your Grace, Jurand of Spychow was dug up. Dug up? Bring him here. Danuska... We were looking for her. Have you left her in Spychow? I was coming to see her here. How can it be? You sent your men and a letter to fetch her. Wake up. By God, where is my child?! Your men came for her with your letter, stating that you were wounded in a fire. They have my child and they will kill her. Who? The Teutonic knights, de Löwe, Gottfried, Rotgier. - You found me? - I did, with others. - Will you help me now? - Your daughter saved my life. - Do you love her? - I will never love anyone else. I will get her back even if I have to tear their castles open with my bare hands. You know what the Teutonic Knights' revenge can be like... Let's go to Spychow. My lord, some monks are waiting for you. They were lingering near Spychow and said they want to talk to you. - Who are you? - Pilgrims. - Where from? - From Szczytno. Where is my child? The one who sent us made it very clear that we must speak in private. - I have no secrets. - But we do. If you let them stay, we will have to leave. If they so wish, we shall leave you. Your daughter was kidnapped by brigands. With crosses on their coats? No! But God blessed them and they got her back. She is with them now. Where? The pious brother Schomberg looks after her. The same who strangled Witold's children. With him, no harm will come upon her. What do I have to do to get my child back? - Be humble before the Order. - Shut up! - Have you got a letter? - No, we will say what we have to say. Your daughter will come to no harm, because the knights want to pay evil back with good. If you meet their just demands. - What do they want? - Free brother Bergov. I Will. And the other prisoners you keep in Spychow. I will not bargain when my child is at stake. I'm not finished. The pious brothers made the following condition to protect the glory of the Order. You must announce to the Duke, and local knights, that your daughter was kidnapped by brigands and not the Teutonic knights and you have to pay a ransom to the brigands. It is true that brigands took my child. And I have to buy her back from brigands. Tell everyone you accepted a ransom for Bergov, so as to be able to pay off the brigands. No one will believe it, I've never accepted a ransom. The life of your child was never at stake. Or you can go to Szczytno to get her yourself. Me? To Szczytno? Brigands might kidnap her again on her way back and once again the pious brothers would be under suspicion. And who will guarantee that I return? The brothers' virtue, theirjustice and piety. Very well, I will go to Szczytno. You will stay here until I come back. And then you will leave with Bergov and the other prisoners. If you don't want to trust the brothers, why should they trust you? Whoever you are, don't try my patience. Say what you were ordered to say. The brothers said that no one is to know where you are going. And didn't they tell you I'll have you tortured in Spychow? Your daughter is in their power. What did they want? Speak. Are you well, my lord? What happened to Danusia? Where is she? What did they say? Why did they come? - They brought a ransom for Bergov. - A ransom? - Where is Danuska? - It's not the Knights who have her. Come here. He is my daughter's betrothed. And after my death he will be the lord of this castle. You will be his faithful servant in peace and in war. Did you hear me? Dear God, why are you giving me Spychow? - I give you Danusia. - The hour of death is unknown. Where is your master? - What are your commands, my lord? - I asked where your master was. - He has left. - Where to? I don't know. He was wearing his armor. Go through the forest and turn right. You'll see the castle from the hill. From the hill, you say. A castle... You're not German, my lord. They didn't pay their taxes. And the Order needs money for the war against Samogitia. And when this war is finished, there will be another. Fishing is forbidden. So is hunting. Mills are heavily taxed, and if quern-stones are found not even women and children are safe. - You'll find your way now. - I will. - God bless you, my lord. - Go with God. - Who is it? - Jurand of Spychow. - Are you Jurand of Spychow? - I am. The pious commander, Siegfried de Löwe, ordered me to tell you, that the gate will open only after you dismount. You must yield all your weapons. The commander orders you to put on this coarse sack, hang this scabbard around your neck, and wait humbly by the gate until the commander's grace will have it opened for you. My child... Get up, you dog. The commander orders you to meet him. Are you Jurand of Spychow? I am. I am to take you to the commander. Follow me. - Do you have any weapons? - I surrendered everything. Beware of losing your temper. You're in the commander's power. Look how the power of the Order defeats anger and pride. It is always God's will. You bit the Order like a dog. And God made you stand before us like a dog with rope around your neck. By calling me a dog you offend those who died fighting against me. - Your pride still makes you spit at us. - I left my pride at the gate. By dishonoring a knight, you dishonor yourselves. Don't complain about your dishonor. For even if we made you our dog-keeper, a dog-keeper of the Order is better than your knight. By the Passion of Our Savior and the salvation of your soul, give me back my child as you promised. - Who did? - You, commander. The word of a Teutonic knight is like the word of God. How can it be? You will not only let the girl but also this mad dog go so he may bite us again? Fret not. The matter is in Gottfried's hands now. Well, wolf, though you've drunk our blood, we'll repay evil with good. - I was cruel but not treacherous. - Here is your child. That's not my daughter. Listen! It's not her! Not her? By St Liborius of Paderborn, we must have saved the wrong girl from the brigands, or she was changed by some sorcerer, because she's the only girl here. She is here. I heard her sing. May all of you bear witness that we kept our promise and we return the girl whom the defeated brigands claimed to be the daughter of Jurand of Spychow. If she is not your daughter, it is not our fault, but the will of our Lord. God sees your treachery. By the wounds of our Savior, by the hour of your death... Give me back my child. If we give her back, she'll be pregnant with my bastard. Spare him! - What are we to debate? - Defeat. As well as the words of the Grand Master and what actions to take to make sure our deeds bring no harm to the Order. It still smells like blood. I ordered the floors to be washed and the room fumigated with sulphur. - Where is brother Gottfried's body? - In the chapel. The brothers are singing a litany for him. - And other bodies? - Left in the snow to stiffen. - Is Jurand alive? - He is. The soldiers wanted to kill him but the chaplain wouldn't let them. The kidnapping of Jurand's daughter was an unfortunate idea. No one will accuse us if the girl disappears. Brother Rotgier speaks wisely. And then anyone mayjudge us, even the Pope or the Roman Emperor. And the girl? - Give her to me. - No, my son. When the Order is at stake, you must renounce pleasure and debauchery. Or your heart will turn hard and cold. Gottfried was killed because he wanted not only to avenge the Order, but also to satisfy his lust. - It will be a trying time for the Order. - An evil night. Brother de Bergov, you will go to the Grand Master. You suffered in Jurand's dungeon, so you will be more credible. Tell them that before you managed to tie this terrible man down, he had killed nine men. Among them brother Gottfried, God give him eternal rest. And tell them that although you wanted to punish the enemy of the Order, we did not unsheathe our swords first. I will tell them all that my eyes have seen. Are you certain, Rotgier, that no one will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter? The only people who knew that we had her were Gottfried, the two of us, and the servant who looks after her. Gottfried ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged. Good. What will you do with Jurand's daughter? I will do what's best for the Order. - Have you courage in your soul, son? - Can you doubt it? I do not doubt it, for I love you for your valor more than anyone else in the world. Go to the Duke of Masovia and tell them everything you saw here. Just as we agreed. - It's not safe. - Do it for the Order. And what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom? Even if he regains his freedom he will never utter a single word against the Order. Mindful of God's commandment we didn't want to kill Jurand, even though he had killed so many of our men, especially brother Gottfried. Ultimately we had to cast a net upon him, then he turned his sword against himself and hurt himself severely. That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices in the air: "enemy of the cross", "he spilled innocent blood", "our Jurand". You said you called Jurand to Szczytno? We did, Your Grace. For when we saved a crippled girl from the brigands we believed she was Jurand's daughter. How could you have believed that after you saw her with me in Cracow? We monks do not look at women. And there were many young ladies accompanying Your Grace in Cracow. How did you know Jurand's daughter was kidnapped? The audacity of this crime and its impiety made it known in our lands. It's strange how you could have taken a cripple for Jurand's daughter. Maybe it was Satan who altered her? But brigands, as simpletons, couldn't have forged Jurand's and his priest's writing. Who could have done it? An evil spirit. These questions cut like knives because there is suspicion in them. I ask Your Grace - did Jurand accuse us of the kidnapping? We have his letter. Yes, it is true. Jurand wrote about brigands. This is how the light of the truth defeats darkness. Reward us for our losses and our blood, he was your subject. And what do you want? Jurand attacked you in a bout of madness and I am to be held responsible for him? He was your subject, his land and castle are located in your duchy, the castle where he kept servants of the Order as prisoners. At least this land should now become the property of the Order. This payment will not bring our murdered brothers back to life, but it might appease the Divine Wrath and prevent dishonor. Don't you have enough of these lands? Pomerania, Prussia, Kulmerland, which used to belong to us, and are now yours. Jurand's daughter is still alive, we have not been informed of her death. And you want to take her dowry. Jurand shed the blood of knights of the Order. You've agreed that we suffered a loss, reward it now as your princely conscience and just soul demand. I have come here as a knight of the Holy Virgin, ready to defend the honor of the Order with my own blood. Whoever wants to accuse the Order, of abducting Jurand's daughter, despite what Jurand himself wrote, should accept this chivalric challenge and face me in a duel. ls there anyone who will pick up my gauntlet? I Will. Zbyszko of Bogdaniec. I take God as my witness, you Your Grace, and all the knights of this land, that I am not guilty of the blood that will be shed here. Christ... They fought according to law and tradition, in a chivalric and godly way. - Is he back? - Not yet. Do not worry, noble commander, in a duel like that, God chooses the winner. - God chooses the winner... - Brother Rotgier is a famous knight. - But he should be back by now. - He will return covered in glory. Go and see who it is. Take the body to the chapel. This is how they sent him back. Is brother Rotgier in the chapel? He is. Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and a lamp. My Cape. Tell him to bring the pot with hot coals. My son... You wrote to me that the other was just a boy. The whole arm... So many times you raised it for the glory of the Order, and now it was chopped off by a Polish axe. The Lord did not bless you. Or maybe he doesn't care for our Order any more. He left me, as well. Even though I served him all my life. No, it's impossible! The truth is with us. I loved you, my son. And you will never speak again. Wait! I will bring you joy! Ready? Once you told tales about what brother Gottfried made you do and then you lost your dog's tongue. So now I warn you, if you even hint what you've done on my orders I will have you hanged. Do you understand? Move on. On your knees, dog. Get out! Light! You were promised you would go free, but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be cut off. Brother Rotgier waits in his coffin, I promised him your right hand. You still have one eye. I had only you and now I have no one. Listen, my son, I swear I will lay the hand that killed you on your grave or I will die trying. But before I can reach him, I will bring worse torment upon him. He will never see the girl again. Who's there? Who is it? Who is it? I've been sentenced to death once already, for attacking a knight of the Teutonic Order. Have me beheaded, Your Majesty, because I will do it again. The Teutonic knights kidnapped Danusia. They lured Jurand into a treacherous ambush. I will go alone and die there. Let it be known to the world what bloody crimes were committed. Have me beheaded, Your Majesty, but defend them. - Speak of them with the Grand Master. - Enough. Can you prove that Jurand and his daughter were ambushed and kidnapped? Who else could have done it, Your Majesty? Have you got witnesses? Your Majesty, I was informed that near Cracow, in the forest in a pitch burner's hut, Sir Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was found. Forgive me, Your Majesty, that I cannot take a more appropriate bow. I was stabbed in the back and the wound has not healed yet. What does it have to do with Jurand's daughter's kidnapping? I bear witness, Your Majesty, that knights from Szczytno talked about kidnapping her in my presence. And when I wanted to stop this atrocity, they stabbed me on the road, like a boar. Will you repeat this in the Grand Master's presence? I testified here in Cracow against Jurand, and now, when justice calls for it, I will testify against the brothers from Szczytno. Your Highness... My lord, please accept my heartfelt thanks. Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec? Hail to the knight of the most beautiful lady in the world. And if you contradict me, I will have to challenge you to mortal combat. Duchess Anna Danuta. Who is it? She is the most beautiful woman in the world. Jagienka! I can't believe my eyes. You look so beautiful. What brings you to the court? My father died and the Duchess took me under her care. But I still miss Zgorzelice. Uncle - you're here! I have always told you, boy, she is a graceful girl. - My lord, the King wants to see you. - Excuse me, my lord. My lords, I have more bad news for you. The Teutonic knights stopped the grain ships which we sent to Lithuania. They claim we intended to use those ships in order to smuggle arms to Samogitia. What does von Jungingen want? To sell our grain to Lithuanians or to find a reason for war? Is war inevitable? Am I to let the Teutonic knights subdue Samogitia, and later Lithuania? - Will they stop at that? - The Order is an immense power. It is true. We will all fail if we let them surprise us one by one. İf we ally ourselves with Lithuania, Russia, and other peoples, we shall win. Your Majesty, should I speak the truth or say what you want to hear? The truth, Castellan. You want us, Your Majesty, to ally ourselves with the pagans and heretics of the East against the Order. These plans do not become a Christian ruler. To weaken the Order is to weaken Christianity. You said you would tell the truth, Castellan. Do I want this war? Who cuts our grain off from foreign countries? Who took Pomerania? If there is a war, it will be a mighty one. So we must start preparing for it today. But first we will try to soothe the whole thing. Castellan, my lords, we shall call upon the Order to return our ships. We shall send envoys to Malbork. You've changed so much. Count de Lorche would like to ask, if the lady you are talking to is mortal, or if she is an angel? Tell him she is an angel, who chose to spend her time among the mortals in a devilishly beautiful body. Stop it, Zbyszko. Any news of Danusia? None. I spoke to His Majesty... We are leaving for Malbork. His Majesty gave permission for you to come with us. Thank you, my lord. - Uncle. - What now? Jurand left Spychow in my care, if I have to prolong my stay in Malbork, I beg you to go there and defend the castle. And who will keep an eye on Bogdaniec? My lord, if you leave nuts on the bench this girl will crack them just by sitting on them. And he insists on traveling the world... I beg you, if I'm not back soon, go to Spychow. Envoys of His Majesty the King of Poland to the Grand Master. Welcome, Polish knights. Envoys of His Majesty the King of Poland to the Grand Master. Envoys of His Majesty the King of Poland to the Grand Master. Show these noble Polish lords the way, brother, and hide nothing from them. Are they prisoners of war? They are rebels, heretics, and pagans, who work here for God's glory. Envoys of His Majesty the King of Poland to the Grand Master. It pleases my heart, my lords, that we are sitting together at one table, as good Christians should. We mustn't let the Samogitians goad us Christians to war against each other. Between the Order and your King. There are testimonies of terrible crimes committed by the Order in Samogitia. As I've already said in Cracow: imperial privileges are not crimes. The privilege states the following: "the Teutonic Order is hereby granted Lithuania, Prussia, Russia and all other heretic lands which the Order can reach with its banners." Oh, how generous the Emperor was in giving what's not his to give. May God forgive you this mockery. Here on earth, the Emperor represents God in all secular matters. It is his task to expand Christian territory. We pray for the soul and eternal rest of your Queen Jadwiga. When she was alive there was peace between us. The rights of popes and emperors and of the Order, their faithful servant, were respected. Let us pray for eternal and earthly peace for all. We know that you are getting ready for a war against the Order. We know that your King has ordered a big hunt, and salted meat in barrels is to be prepared for the army. We ask you directly: Which side will you take, when we attack Lithuania to defend our rights, when we have to punish Samogitia for godless rebellions. Neither Lithuania nor Samogitia is a threat to the Order, rather the Order is a threat to Samogitia and Lithuania. Will you form an alliance with pagans? Peace, peace among Christians. You are our guests. It's our good will to listen to your complaints and consider them and we want to welcome you as we should. We welcome you as neighbors and friends, as we deal with our enemies in two tried and tested ways: a tower full of gold up there and the steel being forged down there. Look, what steel this is. Truly beautiful steel. But you do a lot of harm with it. The Order is pious and just. Just? And what happened to Jurand's daughter and this young knight. Or the attack on sir de Lorche? Does the Order have ways for that, too? Go to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint. And you, my lord. Welcome, count de Lorche. How can it be that we see you here alive, when the commander from Szczytno, notified us that you were attacked on the way from Cracow and murdered. I was attacked by brothers Rotgier and Gottfried from Szczytno because I intended to warn the Duke of Masovia and this noble knight of Bogdaniec of the brothers' plan to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow. Brothers Rotgier and Gottfried are dead. If they committed a crime against a guest of the Order, then heaven has punished them justly. But neither the daughter nor her father were found after he was lured to Szczytno. Jurand of Spychow shed the blood of our knights and must be punished for his crimes. He was unarmed when he attacked those who took his daughter and murdered his wife. Your men deprived him of everything he held dearest in this world. Strange and bad things happen on our borders. There is a lot of injustice on both sides. I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno could act so openly against our vocation and the honor of German knights. The matter will have to be thoroughly investigated. And you probably cannot believe our ships to Lithuania were seized, either. Those ships carried arms for Vytautas. Arms, to be used against the order. - There were no weapons there. - Yes, there were, you can see them. All weapons look alike. - Are you accusing me of lying? - Do you believe your own words? We shall talk about it tomorrow, and as far as the girl is concerned, I will give you safe conduct to Szczytno and an official of the Order to accompany you. Thank you, my lord. - Are you well, Master? - I can't breathe. Take me out. Have you heard the complaint of that young knight and the testimony of de Lorche? Why do brothers from castles on the borders only bring disgrace to the Order? Jagietto demands the return of his ships and the exchange of prisoners of war. JagieHo allies himself with pagans. Those who will rise to help bring Poland to ruin deserve salvation. Christ, Our Lord, converted people with the word not the sword. I warn you, brothers, there is too much injustice in the Order. We have news that the Prussians are ready to rebel. German cities are turning against us. Should we wait until pagans and heretics destroy Christianity? Failure to act will be our downfall. Sometimes, I think that war will be our downfall. Because you are sick and weak, noble brother. We shall call upon the finest knights of all Europe. We shall announce that all who contribute to the destruction of Poland and her King deserve eternal life in Heaven. What do you want? In God's name - war. - War. - War. I tell you this in the final hour of my life, if you care for the good of the Order, wait patiently. Do not start the war now. Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Samogitia... will overrun us. Return their ships. What does that mean? Sanderus! What are you doing here? Be quiet, my lord, brothers shouldn't know we've met before. I was in Szczytno, your lady is still there. How do you know? From the local chaplain, who is a decent man. She is in the care of Commander Siegfried de Lbwe, he won't harm her. He wanted to once but something pushed him down the stairs so hard that he fell ill and almost died. Now he is afraid of her. Do you hear it, my lord? The Grand Master died. What did you just say? The Grand Master is dead? Yes, my lord. I heard they want to elect Ulrich, the old Master's brother, Lord bless his soul. So war is unavoidable now. My lord, I wish you a wise, just, and peaceful reign. We are not here for peace but to fight for our faith against pagans and heretics. Then you have no one to fight, my lord, as you are surrounded by Christian nations. True Christians do not support infidels... What answer should I take to the King, our lord? Will the grain ships be returned? Ships laden with arms are our rightful spoils. May I remind you, my lord, about your late brother's promise and request safe conduct to Szczytno. The knights from Szczytno were sent to fight rebellious Samogitia. You won't find anyone there. Wait until peace is restored. Are you leaving, my lord? The right decision. Everything smells of war here. True. Siegfried de Löwe and his knights went to Samogitia. - I'll look for him there. - You look for him and I'll look for your lady. He must have hidden her somewhere to leave no trace of his crime. Give me, my lord, a purse, and I will go from castle to castle, even though it's dangerous, maybe I'll learn something. - Take it and go. - It is time for us to take our leave, my lord. I wish you luck with your noble search. If you don't mind, my lord, I would like to tell everyone I meet that miss Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the most virtuous and the most beautiful maiden in the world. Tell it to whomever you want. It might as well be true. Jagienka, you're already back from Cracow? Have you heard anything about Zbyszko? I fear for Zbyszko, for he didn't return with the King's envoys. - He didn't... - He stayed among the Teutonic knights. Looking for what he'll neverfind. I have just started my work here and now I need to set off again. He may meet Jurand's fate among those scoundrels. Take me with you. I'll be your servant. I'll help you. You think you'll gain wisdom by casting off your skirt? Wisdom is not in a skirt but in the head. Do you want me to marry Cztan or Wilk? Neither of them will have you. I've made Cztan swear that he will defend you from Wilk, and Wilk swore that he will not let Cztan get you. Jesus gave you a lot of wit I guess now everything will be exactly as you want it. If it were so, my girl, you'd have already been the lady of Bogdaniec. Why are you kissing me? It's nothing. Just a goodnight. It's late and we must set off at dawn. - Aren't you afraid to go? - I'm not. I want to be near Zbyszko. If the other girl dies, Zbyszko won't even look at you in his grief. I don't want him to look at me, I want to be near him. Who is that? - Not a knight because he has no horse. - Probably blind. And doesn't even have a dog. We can't leave him like that. Do you understand Christian speech? - Stand up. - Are you well? Are you dumb? He's trying to say they cut out his tongue. Who did it? The Teutonic knights. Are you from here? From Masovia? What were you doing among the Teutonic knights? Are you coming from Szczytno? Weren't you looking for a child there? You are Jurand of Spychow. - Jesus. - My lord... The Teutonic knights! - We're going to fight them! - Kill the Teutonic knights! Quiet! Will you fight the farmers? They are innocent. The knights keep to their castles these days. We will find the Germans and throw them at the master's feet. I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec. Until he returns I will be the lord of the castle. The young master left two days ago. - Where to? - To the Samogitian border. To look for the lady. - But it's war there... - My God, we missed him. - Hlawa! Where is your master? - At the council. Uncle? Here? I've looked all over for you and finally found you. You thought I'd stay in Bogdaniec till I die? Listen, Jurand is in Spychow. He was blinded by the Teutonic knights. - They removed his tongue and right hand. - What horror... And you? Did you find Danusia? - I didn't... - You didn't? This is my uncle, Macko of Bogdaniec, he has few peers in the art of war. - Welcome, my lord, take a seat. - Welcome. We want to ambush the Germans here. Two days ago we attacked the local castle but we were defeated. - Defeated? - Defeated. We've just been discussing whether we should set up the ambush here by New Kaunas or move to Ragnit. - And where is New Kaunas? - Two miles from here. - And Ragnit? - Far away to the north. It's good that it's so far. The Germans won't expect you there. He's right. Well, we have just been defeated here. They won so they won't expect an ambush. But they won't be at all cautious at Ragnit. - He's right. - So where do we set up the ambush? Here. You will hide in the forest by the road and wait for the Teutonic reinforcements heading for the castle. Two hundred people should stay away from the fight, they will cut off the retreat. - I will attack them from behind. - Clever! The Teutonic knights travel in formation and fight in formation. You plan to break the formation with your bare bellies? You are wrong, uncle, this is a valiant nation, like no other in the world. They are happy, those scoundrels. Attack! Tie him down! That's someone important! - De Lorche. - I recognized you. By the bones of Saint Lawrence, tell me where de Löwe is. - He escaped. - Is Jurand's daughter with him? Jurand's daughter? There is some mad girl whom they showed to Jurand in Szczytno. How do you know she is mad? I heard she was sick and never leaves her coach. Siegfried de Löwe had nothing to do with the kidnapping. He is a faithful servant of the Order, and knew nothing of the crimes committed by Rotgier and Gottfried. - Where did he escape to? - This I do not know. We agreed that if we were attacked, Siegfried with the coach and his detachment would turn back to a safe place to wait till the end of the battle. My lord! My lord, my defender, save me! Without you wolves would have eaten me and now I would have been killed by these sons of the devil. My lord, give me something to drink, before I die of thirst leaving you guilty of an innocent death. Take it, drunkard. - Christ, this is mare's milk. - You don't have to drink it. Thank you, my lord, for taking care of me. You've never refused me money or a better drink than this mare's milk, which I find disgusting, but I will drink some more to show that a pious pilgrim is ready for every kind of mortification. Enough of yourjokes. Tell us what you know about Danusia. Wait. You're dear to me, my lord. When misfortune struck I told myself I had to help you. It would take a long time to tell where I went and whom I asked. Suffice it to say that I did find, and didn't let go, of the commander Siegfried de Liiwe. - Is Danusia alive? - She is. He carries her around locked inside a wicker coach. It's a cripple de Löwe takes everywhere with him - since he went slightly mad after his son died. - What a cripple! You said it yourself, my lord, that your lady had a lute with her and sings beautifully, and so pitifully. - Where are they? - Somewhere near. Commander de Löwe led the relief forces going to New Kaunas. When he saw we were ambushed he ordered retreat. - Where can they be? - I don't know. Probably in the potter's house in the forest where we stopped last. - To your horses! - Wait, my lord, wait. Give me a horse, I will go first and tell them I escaped. It will be safer, your lady may need me when you attack Siegfried de L6we's detachment. Don't trust this drunkard, my lord. Give him a horse, he didn't cheat me before, he won't cheat me now. Sanderus. He took their swords and armor. Take old Siegfried, he is inside. And I will take that German. Hlawa, look for Danusia. Go alone! Tie him down! Tie him down! What happened to you? Help me up. Hold this. Danuska, Danuska. - I'm scared... - Danuska, it's me, Zbyszko. - I'm scared... - Danuska, it's me, Zbyszko. Danuska! Danuska! Let me go! I'll kill him like a dog. You want to murder a prisoner? Danuska, don't you recognize me? Danuska! I'm scared... You will give the lady a clean dress. And you will put on the rags you've made her wear. - And when you're done, we'll find a branch for you. - Danuska! Save me! Stay away from her! This is the result of her suffering. Now you know the nobility of Siegfried. Take him to Spychow and throw him at Jurand's feet. Tell Jagienka that Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly. Move on! Life in Poland is much more difficult and complex than what I ever imagined in Lorraine. You must choose, my lord. A guide can take you to Cracow, if you want stay with us. If not, you may go back to Malbork. Farewell! Maybe God will let us meet again. Take him. I was ordered, my lord, to bring Siegfried de Löwe to you. He stands before you; this evil man, this Teutonic thug who tortured you and brought ruin to your child. Give me a sign what to do with him, how to punish him. On your knees, dog. What are you doing, my lord? My lord, surely you do not intend to set the devil free? You want to let the prisoner go? You want him to go unpunished? Why did we chase him across the world? The prisoner belongs to him and he can do whatever he chooses. If your will is to be done, my lord, we must lead the prisoner to the border. This is our border, yours isn't far from here. If your grief or God's thunder don't kill you, people will not harm you. Go free. Stop! - I can smell flowers... - Danuska... - Where am I? - Near Spychow. Danuska, wait! Merciful Jesus, wait! Wait! Danuska! I looked for her until I found her and won her back, but she preferred to see God than Spychow. Call to arms! Call to arms! Soon, the sun will rise and the battle will begin. Repeat my orders once again. You, Grand Duke? The Lithuanian army on the right flank, by Tannenberg. You, brother Lengvenis? Smolensk regiments nearer the Polish flank, Mstsislav regiments in the middle of the Lithuanian units, the knights from Novgorod by me. And your men, Jalal al-Din Khan? My men will go with the Lithuanians. Allahu akbar. And you, John of Lamberk? Czech units will take their place by regiments from Smolensk, others with Poles. You, marshal? As you ordered, Your Majesty, I left sixty mounted knights for your protection. Cracow regiment in the center of the left flank, near Ludwigsdorf. Behind them, regiments from Sieradz and Poznari. I ordered deep pits to be dug in front of our army and for them to be well concealed. When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into the pits, they will be an easy target for our archers and guns. And then our cavalry will attack from both sides. And if the Poles refuse to attack first? JagieHo is a prudent leader. JagieHo and Vytautas are cunning and crafty, but they lack the artistry of European knights. Their men know nothing of obedience, they are hot-blooded, they will attack first. No, our heavy cavalry will attack last. First the Tatars and light Lithuanian cavalry. The furs and wooden shields of Lithuanians and Tatars will last only a moment against swords, when the armored Teutonic knights attack them. They will be our scouts, checking for ambush. I know it's dangerous. We've won all our battles attacking in formation. We will crush them at once with our heavy cavalry and armor. Every precaution must be taken, first the pits, then the cannons and archers. And finally, I will lead sixteen regiments into the battle. I will fight among you. As becomes a true knight. The king should not join the fight for then he wouldn't be able to command it. Eastern tradition has the leader commanding his troops from a hill. - From there he can see everything. - Wisely spoken, Grand Duke. Yes, this is the way they fight in the East. - It's dawn. - Time to move the army into the battlefield. - Lead the army. - No! They will wait in the forest, do not hurry. It will be easier to form the regiments under the cover of the forest and to wear armor in the shade. We should hide in the bushes? We want to fight in the open field as becomes a lord. - I won't be able to restrain the knights. - You are to wait. Even you cannot stop them, Your Majesty. What is your command? Do as I say - wait. Father Bartholomew will read a mass. Or two. Wait in the forest! Let us bow down to the Sun. How many of these pagans are hiding in the forest? A hundred thousand, I reckon. It will be the greatest battle of our time. We don't know how many Teutonic Knights there are but we have never seen so many. Maybe a hundred thousand. What is the name of the village where the Teutonic knights set up their camp? Grunwald. Before those barbarians decide where to stand, our regiments will assume the best position, and there, look brothers, there are the guests of the Order. The best knights of all Europe. The rest is in the hands of the Lord, he will help his faithful servants. The rest is in the hands of the Lord, he will help his faithful servants. Your Majesty, the Teutonic knights are taking their positions. To work, brothers! It will be a bloody struggle, but it will ensure the rule of Christianity in the East for millennia. - The Grand Master - hail! - Hail! Hail! Hail! My lords, it's time for mass. Your Majesty, knights from Bavaria, Swabia and Franconia joined the Teutons. Stop the mass! My horse! Your Majesty, knights from Rhineland, Frisia and England. They're hiding. They should stick to spoons and not pick up swords. You don't know them, Poles are courageous, but their King still expects envoys of peace. It's a disgrace! The whole power of the Order fears the Poles. I'd rather die! Even if I have to do it on my own, I will attack the whole Polish army with these two swords. It's disobedience! Think, how we can lure the enemy out of the forest. Your Majesty, envoys from the Teutonic knights. The Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges you, Your Majesty and Grand Duke Vytautas to mortal combat. And to strengthen your courage, which you so clearly lack he sends you these two unsheathed swords. The Grand Master wants you to know, that if you need more room for the battle, he will withdraw his army so that you don't have to hide in the bushes. We have enough swords but we accept these two as a foretoken of our victory. Stop the heavy cavalry! They don't go first, stop! Stop! Stop! Turn back! Go to Duke Vytautas and Jalal al-Din. Attack! Lithuania! Damn them! They broke through. This is Wit0ld's light cavalry. Wallenrod! Begin in the name God. They won't break through, we will trample our archers. Attack! Go“ m“ uns. Our knights! They will trample us! Your Majesty, send reinforcements, save our army. Lichtenstein! Charge! Charge! Kalisz and Sieradz regiments - support the right flank. Help Masovia! The banner is in danger! Powata! Take three regiments, go round the enemy and attack! Turn back! Turn back! We'll go around them and attack their flank. Zyndram! The infantry is attacking! Attack! Attack! Kuno von Lichtenstein, do you recognize me? I do. I swore I'd find you and fight you. Fight then. It is mortal combat. Fight! Take off your helmet. Fight, you dog! This is the man who this very morning claimed to be stronger than the mightiest of the world. Jagna? Jagna! The End
