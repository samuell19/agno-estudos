No offense taken. Oh right. You don't look very happy for a man holding an engagement ring. No. Right, I'll leave you to it. If you wouldn't mind, yeah. - Sorry. - It's all right. I think we missed the last train. Really? The last train isn't due 'til six. I've been sitting here for two hours. The snow must have taken some of the lines out, nothing's getting out this far. [Jen sighing] Well, that is great. Of all the days to get stuck out here. It's not ideal. Yeah. So where are you heading to? Glasgow. Same. Do you not have anywhere out here to stay? No. Me neither, not anymore. Hi, I'm Jen. Rob. You know Christmas is the best time of year to make new friends, right? Is that right? Absolutely. Especially when you drop a few. You know it's like teeth, when one falls out, another moves in. Out with the old, in with the new, all of that. It's the most wonderful time of the year! Christmas is supposed to be about joy, giving, and being surrounded by those you love, or you know, those you have literally just met. You. You talk a lot! Yeah, just trying to fill that dead air. So why are you here alone on Christmas Eve? Let's just say today didn't go as planned. You and me both. Yeah? Like I said, all men are- [tense dramatic music] Illegitimate, I got it. Let's team up! I beg your pardon? Look we are both going the same place, so surely if we pool our resources we can get home. Come on, no-one ought to be alone at Christmas. And say we do, am I gonna have to listen to more cliches like that? Without a doubt! It is the season [laughs]! I'm a bit of a Christmas nut, just wait until you get to know me. All right. Come on. Okay, what's our game plan? Oh, bingo! Local taxi company. - A taxi, You're kidding? - Why? 'Cause it'll cost a fortune. It's Christmas, I'm sure we can haggle. [stammers] I promise I won't break it. [phone dinging] You're wasting your time. [Jen hushes] I'm trying to save the day. [cellphone ringing] - Hello there, Taxis.| - Hello? Hi, yeah, can we have a taxi at the train station, please? - Aye, all right, pet. - Yeah, it's going to Glasgow. [operator laughing] - Hello? - Brilliant. What is it? [Operator] Wait a minute, would you like the regular sleigh or the estate? - What was that? - Do I need to go and get Rudolf out of his stable [laughs]? Glasgow, oh that's brilliant [laughs]. [cellphone dinging] [cellphone ringing] She wanted to go to Glasgow. What did you expect on Christmas Eve? It's a 6-hour round trip for the driver, who would risk it? Well, you know what about festive spirit, goodwill to all men and all that? It froze to death 20 minutes ago. Come on, what are we doing? Well, do you have anyone that can come and pick us up? - Parents? - They're on a cruise, yours? Don't drive. - Who doesn't drive nowadays. - Yeah all right, Judgey. Yes, I know where we can get a car. Thought you had nowhere to go. Would you just trust me, and come on. Do you know what, stay here, freeze your plums off, I'm going. Okay, okay, coming. [gentle whimsical music] [birds chirping] What are we doing here? Procuring transport. Procuring? Yeah, I'll be just a second. [Mark murmuring] [Mark] No, I don't want it, it's your usual excuse. It's your usual reply, because you always do it. [Mark murmuring] [Clare] Fancy women comes to the house. [Mark] Fancy women? What fancy women, how do you get there? [Clare shouting] [Mark shouting] And don't tell me to move, you always say that [indistinct]. I don't know why [laughs]. [Clare shouting] Oh, come on, don't start. [Clare] We have our son here. [Mark] Don't bring him in, what's Noah got to do with it. What has Noah got to do with it? [Clare] She met him at the door. Is it my fault? [both shouting] Jackpot [gasps]! [keys jangling] Elf? Noah, Isn't it? Why are you in here? Oh, I am doing some recon for Santa, I'm working for him. Yeah, so I have to get him some keys. - Magic keys. - Yeah, yeah. Not all houses have got chimneys, so I need to give magic keys to Santa, so that he can get in on Christmas Eve. But why can't Santa use his own magic keys? Yeah he can, but every house has got a different lock, so I need to come in and get the keys for that house. Noah, why are you hiding in a cupboard? Because my Mum and Dad are shouting. Oh. Yeah. Noah, You are the best boy. Seriously, Santa talks about you all the time, you are at the top of his nice list. I need to get out of here so that I can get your letter to Santa so you need to help me get out without any grown-ups seeing me. Why can't the grown-ups see you? Because grown-ups ruin magic Oh, yeah. Yeah, so if you check out there, and make sure that there's no adults out there, - can you do that for me? - Mm-hmm. [door unlatching] [uptempo whimsical music] Come on, Elfie. [door squeaking] Thank you so much, Noah! Merry Christmas! Mm-hmm. [footsteps thudding] Hi. [uptempo whimsical music] This one [laughs]. Oh you can't be serious? It's fine, let's go [uptempo dramatic music] [car engine growling] [Jen panting] Get that heater on, it's freezing. I don't get it, if you had a car waiting a few streets away, then why were you waiting for a train? It's my ex's. It can't have been that bad a breakup if he let you borrow his car. Yeah right, remember how I mentioned - that all men are bastards. - Yeah, yeah, years, within two minutes of meeting me, - you said it twice in fact - Yeah. Well, mostly I was talking about him. You know, I am sure he will understand that when he finds out he loaned me his car. Do you mean he doesn't know? Not yet, no. [uptempo whimsical music] Have we just stolen this car? Stolen [laughs], such an ugly word. No [laughs], you're shitting me?! Oh God I'm in a stolen car It's gonna be the first Christmas I spend not just alone, but alone inside of a prison cell. You, you're an actual crazy person. Would you calm down. I mean so what. So what. I hope he cries like a baby when he finds this is gone. He is a lying, cheating bastard. He deserves everything he gets! - Jen! - Oh, he loves this car. - Jen! - [chuckles] Well, he doesn't know the meaning of the word, love! I am gonna roll this '60s piece of shit - over a motherf###### cliff - - Jen! Jen watch the road, stop! [tires screeching] [car engine growling] My God, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm [pants] so sorry. That's okay. Would you like me to drive? No, I'm okay, I'm okay, I, I can do it. Okay. Gosh, the weather is horrible Its fine, it's just because we're up high. All Scottish mountains have snow on the top. I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were a meteorologist Will you please, please! Don't make me beat you to death with a thesaurus Pardon me, I'll try and limit myself to less than two syllables from now on, shall I? Is something coming towards us? - [siren blaring] - Oh. Oh! They found us! Shit. [Jen chuckling] [car engine growling] [window whooshing] [Officer] You all right there. Hi. That's a fancy car you've got, you don't see many of them on the road. - Oh God. - [hushes] Oh right. I thought they were pretty common. No. No, a car like that definitely stands out. Right, does it? I think it would best if you both stepped out of the vehicle and come out into the police car Look, this was all her idea, I had absolutely nothing to do with me! - What are you saying, lad? - Would you be cool. I'm just saying it was her that took the car! I would have stopped her if I'd known! What are you saying? [laughs] He's saying he wanted me to bring the Jeep! But you know what, I didn't think it was gonna be this bad, so I convinced him to come in this. Who are you two making for? - Prison. - Glasgow. Glasgow, no chance. It's only going to get worse. the road's a bit of a mess, best give up before you get stuck. Where have you just come from? Bridge of Orchy, but it wasn't so bad down there, it's up here the snow's falling fast. I think we're gonna take a chance, thanks though Oh, you're mad! You'll never make it. Find somewhere warm and bed down for the night We'll be okay, thanks. [car engine growling] [Rob sighing] - You total grass! - Are you kidding? We were just stopped by the police in a stolen car. You totally stuck me in it! And you totally just made me an accessory - to grand theft auto! - And yet, not in prison! You're welcome. Look, let's just get going - Whoa, what are you doing? - What? He's literally just said, the road is un-passable. He didn't say it was un-passable. He said the snow was thick up here. We'll be fine once we got off the mountains. And its worth the risk? Well, it's either carry on, or sleep in the car. Now, I'm happy with either as long as you don't mind getting cozy. Just. Just drive slowly. And the first sign of the weather turning bad, we turn around, agreed? Trust me. [uptempo dramatic music] Last time you said that you stole a car [car engine growling] [car engine growling] [snow whooshing] are we stuck? Yeah, it's just sliding. Stop, stop, stop it. You'll burn out the clutch Can you see the road? - No. - No. Well that's that then, we're not going anywhere. Jesus Christ! [door unlatching] [door latching] [door unlatching] [door latching] I said we should turn back. We were warned, but did you listen, did you? Hell no, and now here we are, freezing to death in the middle of nowhere! At least I don't have to worry about going to prison for grand theft auto, but it's a shame in a way, 'cause Big Bobo my cellmate could have kept me warm. Do you know what? I know I've only known you about five minutes, but I've got a wee observation to make. You are incapable of listening to anyone! Trains canceled, taxis say it's too far, the police say it's too dangerous, but you!, you steal your ex's car, and you almost kill us, you're certifiable. [Jen sobbing] No, no, no, no, don't you cry. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, all right? I know I can be a bit of a dick but please, please don't cry Oh, I'm just screwing with you [laughs]. I can cry on cue. It's kind of a party trick. But you're really mean. You can't speak to people like that. Seriously? Yeah, don't be a dick. That's good. Don't be a dick [laughs]. [Rob screaming] Do you feel better? Do you know where we are? I think so, I'm pretty sure there's a village just up ahead. How does that help? 'Cause nothing is getting out this far. Well, they will obviously have a recovery truck, or a plow, or something [sighs]. Like these wee villages need to be prepared for this sort of stuff Yeah, we'll just call them up, we'll say "Hey, can you send your recovery truck, or your plow, or something on Christmas Eve?" Or are you just planning on stealing that too? Why, are you gonna grass me in again? I don't see how I'm the bad guy here when you stole a car. Look, if you aren't calling the fuzz, I really wanna go home for Christmas, so can we please just try? Well, we sure as shit can't stay here [uptempo whimsical music] [door unlatching] [bags crumbling] [Rob sighing] Christ almighty, have you got enough stuff? No, probably not. [tense dramatic music] What are you? Do you want me to help you with some of those bags? No, I can manage. So, what happened? I think it's a combination of the low body, and the tires just not being equipped. I know, I mean you obviously weren't supposed to be on your own on Christmas Eve waiting for a train, so what happened? Oh come on, your story cannot be as bad as mine. Oh really. So what's your story? So you see? You don't wanna talk about it any more than I do. Smart arse. [sighs] Look, will you please just let me carry some of those bags. I think I can carry a couple of bags by myself. Shit. [Rob thudding] Sorry, what was that? Smart arse! - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine, thank you. Jesus Christ. Okay, if it stops you from falling on your arse, you can carry some of my bags [sniffs] Why are you carrying all that crap? I'm not, you are. Right. Yeah well, not all of us are as good at being alone as you are. Oh God, I'm sorry, that came out wrong. - I didn't mean that- - It's fine! - I have like a [stammers]- - Forget it! [wind howling] [Rob sniffing] Let's get going, we need to get to the village before it gets dark. Sure. God, I picked a great time to quit smoking. Yeah, I think we're lost. I might actually be able to do something about that. My watch has a compass. O fancy. Yeah, it's also only a couple of hours old. Are you sure you know how to work it? Yes, I've got my Gold Duke of Edinburgh. Oh well, I feel completely reassured. - We're going that way. - If you say so. Trust me. [uptempo dramatic music] Lead on, McDuff. [laughs] oh. [glasses clanking] - Good evening. - Are you lost? - No. - Yes. Out the way, come on in, don't be shy, your mother wasnae. Sorry about them, they're harmless, mostly. Now, how can I help you? Our car got stranded a few miles back, do you have a tow, or a plow, or anything nearby? There sure is, round at McLarnon's Garage Brilliant, do you have a number? I'll give it to you. They'll be open first thing on Boxing Day Boxing Day? No, I need to go home tonight! Oh, I'm sorry, pet, that's just not going to happen. Look, I know it's Christmas Eve, but my friend here really needs to get home. - We'll pay anything. - Oh, it's not a matter of money, son. - It's snowed in. - Snowed in. The snow plow is snowed in, how's that even possible? Garage door won't open. The plow is on the wrong side of the door. [Ernie laughing] Look, I'm sorry, but I think this is it. That's okay, I was daft to think we could get back anyway. Do you have any rooms left? You're in luck. There is one room left at the Inn! - One room? - Mm-hmm [affirmative]. The last room in the house. Well, we'll just have to make do then, it's a twin yeah? No, it's a, it's a double. [laughs] Right. It's fine, we'll take it. You know what, I'll just kip down here in the reception Oh, I'm very sorry, that is against hotel policy. Come on, we'll top and tail, you know with pillow dividers like you did when you were a kid. I don't know. I promise my feet don't smell. You know, I've seen a lot of things from behind this desk. A lot of beautiful women trying to avoid getting into bed with strange men, but never the other way round. You calling me strange? You calling me beautiful? I'll need a credit card, or debit card, or pound of flesh. Just my wee joke, I prefer plastic. - I'll get this. - No seriously let me. No Honestly. I'll get the room, you got the car. Touche! [machine beeping] It is your card, right? Well, it's top of the stairs, last room on the right. Thanks. There's just one more thing. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Yeah, thank you. [uptempo festive music] [door latching] 20 quid says he gets his hole before midnight. I'll take that bet. 30 quid, did you say? - 20. - 20? All right, here you are. You still owe me 50 quid. What number did he say again? He didn't, he said last on the left. Are you sure about that, I think he said right? I know my left from my right. Okay, well you might wanna have a little word with your fancy compass-watch thing. Why? Because this isn't Bridge of Orchy, it's Glencoe, we've dumped the car and doubled back on ourselves! And how is that my fault. "Ooh, I got my gold Duke of Edinburgh," who reads a compass upside down! I just don't wanna talk to you, all right? - Chris. - Ow. Chris, you come back here, and apologize to this lady. I'm so sorry, apparently I can't do anything right - at the moment. - No, don't worry about it. - Teenage boys are tough. - Well yes, and then eventually they grow up to be adults. Nothing worse than adult males, they're the worst! - It must be this one. - No, it's the left All right. [door unlatching] [door latching] [Rob sighing] Well, this is. It is nothing that a bit of tinsel and a tree wouldn't fix. Oh excellent, well, give me five minutes, I'll pop out, I'll chop down a pine tree. We could plant it in the toilet. Awesome [giggles]. What's in these bags? What's in these? It's undelivered Christmas presents. - Undelivered? - Yes, undelivered. Okay, well, you can have the bed, I'll be fine here [tense dramatic music] [mirror squeaking] It is really coming down out there. The shower's free. No, you're all right. You should really get changed, you'll get ill. Yeah, yeah, well, I haven't got anything else. [bag thudding] There you go, Merry Christmas. Is this not for someone? No, not anymore. Are you sure, because won't someone? No, away and get yourself sorted, go. Right, right. Maybe we can head down to the bar, and get some dinner. - Yip. - Yeah, maybe a wee dram - to warm us up. - Sure. 'Cause we deserve it, you drink whisky? [somber dramatic music] [shower running] [door unlatching] [Rob sighing] [Jen laughing] - Oh, can I- - what are you doing? [electronic festive music] That's perfect. [laughs] No, no, it's not happening, absolutely not. [case clanking] Oh. Yours? Yeah. Sorry. - Sorry, I didn't mean to- - No, no, [stammers] it's fine, it's fine. - It's just- - No, no, no. You don't have to explain this. I don't even know what I'm still doing with it, It's bit of a story. - Do you want to? - No. No, thank you. I'm fine. Did you say something about whiskey. Listen, I am here- - Jen, whiskey. ♪ The stars brightly shine ♪ ♪ In the night ♪ ♪ While the deer say goodnight ♪ "Night of the Living Dead" in here. Okay, well, we'll soon fix that.

Right, your turn. The ring, tell me about your, who is she? Yeah, to be honest, I'd rather just forget about that just now. I just wanna erase this [stammers] whole day. If only we could put that on our Christmas list. I know. Maybe we could still ask Santa for a time machine! Don't be so ridiculous. Look, he will have already left. [both laughing] You know I don't know about you, but I could do with another drink. Good idea. It's my round! Is it me, or is this place severely understaffed. Well it's not exactly "Friday Night at The Apollo," is it? [uptempo guitar music] - Hey, excuse me. - Hey. - Can I maybe ask a favor? - Absolutely. Do you think you could play something a little bit more festive? Was it something I said? Anna give you the cold shoulder? A bit frosty, yeah. Well, she's been here, what, three days now, and hardly spoken to a soul. Aye, the poor lassie she told me that- - Come on now, it's not your story to tell. Right you are, I'll just shut up, and drink my drink. - All right, cheers. - Slainte. Speaking of, what do you actually have to do to get a drink around here. I heard the chef walked out this morning. Worried he was gonna get stuck here and not get home. He had the right idea. Apparently, it's just the manager left, pulling double duty. - I'm Jim, by the way. - Rob, how do you do? Enjoying our Highland Christmas? Not quite. So do you come up here every Christmas? First time actually. Spending it with my daughter, she was in Inverness with her mom. Oh, right. You got kids? No, no, no, no kids. Well, you won't understand until you're a dad, but let me tell you this. No woman will ever break your heart like your own daughter! Anyway, have a good one! Who puts an orange down a toilet [indistinct] [glasses clanking] - [all laughing] - Yes. - There we go. - Good idea. - There we are. - Here. - Two for me, thank you. - Ooh, greedy. Ne for each hand. [Jim laughing] Gosh, that's a bit generous. Don't leave us out. And there we are now. That's you, that's you, and there's yourself. Now, there we go. Now, I'll tell him when he comes out of the bog. [all laughing] - Bottoms up. - Cheers. Cheers. It was me that put in the orange [laughs]. Ooh, thanks. You're welcome. I asked the band to play something a little bit more festive before people in here starts slashing their wrists It couldn't hurt. - ♪ Right along those shallows ♪ - Look, I didn't mean to push you there.

Okay, I was the head boy and she was head girl in our year. We had everything, everything going for us. So over the years, you know, I brought up the idea of marriage a few times, but then three years ago, I thought I'm gonna properly propose. That's when I got the ring, and I got our names engraved on it, and everything. But she told me, in no uncertain terms that she wasn't ready. And then she made me feel like, like we both weren't ready, and she asked me to wait. So, I waited until today. I produced the ring again, and then I asked her, and I got the same answer. But this time she said, she loves me, but she's not sure she's in love with me. No. [somber dramatic music] Yes, so there was like standing alone, thinking how did I get here, how did my relationship become this? What even was my relationship, was it love? Or had love just become familiar, convenient? I don't know, I don't, I don't have the answers, but what I do know is that 12 hours ago, I had everything, just everything right at my fingertips. Now all I've got is frostbite.

[match flicking] [rain pouring] [match flicking] You'd never know it had been snowing. Give it 20 minutes. You know that's bad for you? You should try this instead. Oh, that is nasty. Told you so. Where did you even get it. Cigarette machine covered in dust, looked a decade old. [Rob grunting] I think the universe is trying to tell you something really deep like [stammers] quit. I've got control over our nothing in my life just now, except for this, this foosty fag. So the tobacco police can do one. Point taken. It's midnight. Uh-uh, not yet. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do you know we should be toasting or something. Come on, I don't feel like toasting Come on, stay in the moment. To, wow [laughs]. To. To the unlucky? [Jen sighing] To the stranded. The deserted. To the lonely. To the abandoned. To strangers. [uptempo dramatic music] To strangers. [glasses clanking] Yeah, I know that look on your face, I've been wearing it myself all day. It's that crushing, sick-to-your-stomach feeling. [sighs] All these years living a lie. All those years I thought it was love. That wasn't love. Then what is? Am I even capable of it? What if I never find something real? What if we have found it, and missed it, because we were living a lie? No one should be alone on Christmas. You and Christmas. [uptempo dramatic music] [cellphone ringing] - Shit. - Yeah [grunts]. Do you know what, I'm really tired, and I'm not really thinking straight, so I'm gonna go to bed. You should call her back. Yeah, maybe. Hey, everything will be fine. It's Christmas. - Would you stop that please? - What? All of that childish tmas-will-make-everything-better stuff, it won't! It's not some magical event where all the wrongs are righted. Roll up, roll up for one day only, the shit doesn't stick. You can't, you can't just put a pin in feelings, and leave them 'til Boxing Day, 'cause that's not how feelings work. "Oh thanks, Santa, for coming down on your magical sleigh, and making it so as we don't have to worry about war, or poverty, or heartbreak! I'm so glad it's the 25th of December, and now I can just be deliriously happy, 'cause who's sad on Christmas," don't, don't kid yourself. Or if you are, don't drag me in, don't drag me in to the delusion. Christmas is a day just a day, just a miserable shit day like all the others. [somber dramatic music] Goodnight then. Shit.

If we can't go home for Christmas, then I'm bringing Christmas to us! Sid, I will need place settings for 10! Nine. Would you come on! Lift that rain cloud for one day! I am not gonna let your negativity ruin Christmas! How dare you? You know absolutely nothing about me. You don't know any of us, so how dare you force your faux, cheerful Christmas spirit on us? Yeah, I've seen your face when you think no one's been looking, you are full of shit. And you know what? No amount of Christmas spirit is gonna fix what broke you. So don't you dare drag us through this pantomime-like puppets in your healing process. Grow up and leave me out of it. Sorry, my dear, we're just not feeling very festive. Aye. Most of the folk down here come up to get away from all that Christmas stuff. I'm the only hotel in about a 100-mile not making a fortune making Christmas dinner today for a reason. So what? The only thing you have in your kitchen is sullen skank? Guys. Come on! [footsteps thudding] Really? Was that? Was that necessary? You're all here by choice, but she is stuck here. Miles from home and her family on her favorite day of the year. She just wants someone to share it with, we can't give her that? She just wants to spread a bit of joy. Are we all so determined to be miserable, we can't just let someone be happy? Shame on us. [footsteps thudding] [door latching] I could do Christmas. I actually really love Christmas. Then why in God's name did you come away instead of staying at your mom's for the party? I've done Christmas at my mom's for years. I wanted to be with you. You should have told me. [wind howling] [door unlatching] [Jen sobbing] Oh, don't take it personally, my dear. Her wife died in a car accident a few months back, and well, people say things they don't mean when they're grieving. My God, it's her first Christmas alone. Yes, well, can't blame her. We want to pretend it isn't happening. And all this time I've been throwing it in her face, because I didn't wanna admit that I was hurt [sobs]. I'm such a dick. No, don't beat yourself up, pet. I can't even imagine, and I thought I knew what heartbreak felt like. Well, it's all relative. Pain isn't a competition. When my Susan passed away, I couldn't face up to it. Oh Christ, listen to me, passed away. I'm still trying to soften the cold, hard truth of it. I think that is a perfectly natural thing to do. Aye, well, Whatever the pain and whenever it came from, we all need that anchor to help us back on our feet again. That mad old bugger in there, he's my anchor. [Jen laughing] Yes, and Anna well, she hasn't got one yet. But you, well, I think you have in that young man. [sighs] I don't know. Ships passing in the night, perhaps. Come on, let's go back inside. Can't stay out here in this weather. I think I'm gonna take a walk. See if the roads have cleared any. No, be safe. I'll be fine. [somber dramatic music] [footsteps thudding] [door unlatching] [uptempo pop music] Ah laddy, I've just been speaking with your good lady oh, you know what I mean. She could do with a friend. Where is she? She's gone for a walk. She says, she's going to see if the roads are clear. - On our own? - Mm-hmm. Christ. [somber dramatic music] Jen! [tense dramatic music] Jen! Jen! Rob? Rob, I think I hear you. Jen. - What were you thinking? - I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking. I just needed to get away, so I could think. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we got stranded. I'm sorry you didn't get the Christmas you wanted. - It's just a day. - No, it's not. If you've taught me anything, it's that Christmas should be about so much more than that. It's about bringing people together, and, and here we are. I don't think our paths were ever supposed to cross. You get on my nerves, we're nothing alike, you made me steal a car, and now, we're freezing to death, but there's something about you. You make me feel warm inside. I don't know what this is but I know you. [uptempo dramatic music] They're coming, they're coming. [uptempo jazz music] [bell ringing] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to have you all here. at the Clachaig for a very extraordinary Christmas dinner. Please be seated. [stammers] I don't understand [laughs]. Well, you see, someone helped us find our Christmas spirit [laughs]. I mean it's, - it's. - Perfect. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Go ahead. [all chuckling] There's your name tag, look, just there. Sit yourself down there, lad. Thank you. I don't suppose you saw the kids - when you were outside? - No, I don't think so. My Chris is a good boy. That's what I'm worried about. I was a good boy too, I know what they get up to. [all laughing] Aye, young love, you were there the once. I'm surprised you can remember [all laughing] Christmas brings out the romantic out in us all. Aye that is true. That reminds me, you two old codgers owe me 20 quid. That's not an admission of hee-haw. [all laughing] [all jeering] [all cheering] What are you all looking at? - We were just outside- - Snogging? Snogging,...Dad, nobody says that anymore! You're so embarrassing. [all laughing] Here's To the first kiss, or as we say up here, a sheep dip [laughs]. I think what he means to say is, to young love. Aye, lang may yer lum reek. [all laughing] Cheers to that, cheers to that. [all laughing] [glasses clanking] Oh, hey. [all applauding] Bravo, bravo. What, what's going on? Well, I'm looking for new horizons, and Sid's looking for a chef, so one day at a time. I didn't know you were a chef. Are you kidding me, she cooked all the Christmas dinner. Did you really? [Sid] It's all edible. I didn't know. Thank you It doesn't mean I like Christmas. I just couldn't bear the thought of you guys after all of your hard work having to eat Sid's food [all laughing] None taken. Merry Christmas, everyone - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. [people murmuring] [glasses clanking] - [slow dramatic music] - Merry Christmas. Let's get started. Here, pass the salad. Aye. It's hot. [people murmuring] [slow dramatic music] And she was not going to just feel like there was any point [wind howling] [Ernie snoring] That's the first proper Christmas dinner I've had in years. Christmas was always about the wee, one you know? So when she wasn't around, I just didn't feel like there was any point anymore. They just don't need you like they used to. Oh my God, tell my about it. We live in the same house, barely ever see him. Lost to a generation of X-Stations, and Playboxes, and. What about his father? [laughs] Yeah, that shipped sailed a long time ago, and if we are very lucky, it bloody sank! [Jim laughing] I know what you mean. [people murmuring] Okay, sorry folks, bad news. The band can't get through. The road's blocked coming through the moor. I think we're gonna be singing for our supper tonight. But that's all right, we could just put the CD on again. No. No, don't do that. You have all worked so hard to give me my Christmas, so let me ruin yours [laughs]. - [all laughing] - Okay. - Ah, awesome. - Thank you. [chair thudding] Wrapping your pain in tinsel doesn't make it go away, and I'm sorry if I forgot that, and I'm even more sorry if I made it harder, but my worst Christmas ever has become my best, because I have met this collection of people that care. People care.
