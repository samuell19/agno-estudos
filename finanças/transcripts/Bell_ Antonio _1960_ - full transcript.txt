You don't like me. Why have you come with me if you don'! like me? If I can't make you love me? I was already satisfied with meeting you, staying close to you. The other day you left in my car a letter from your father. - I read it. - What letter? He's asking you to go back to Calania and think about marriage. You're wrong, I can't understand my father's handwriting either. I don't want to many you, I just want to stay close to you. Real close. Antonio, don't go away. I don't want anything from you, don't worry. I won't bother you at all. I'm not like the others. Yet, you're like the others. What do you mean? You don't know what you're saying. I came here ready to do anything, because I love you. But I'm a young girl, do you understand? A young girl! If the most ridiculous of your fellow countrymen married me, he would have nothing to complain about. The women from your island, during the first wedding night in the hotels in Taormina, are all tears. I wouldn't cry, even if you killed me. My love, what's the matter? Slay close to me, real close! Why are you humiliating yourself? I can't. I can't. Why not, Antonio? Why? Mom! Antonio! - Ninuzzo! - Mom! - How are you? I'm fine. Di Paula's son is dead and aunt Santina has a pulse of 30 beats per second, but the doctor says she'll live for 100 years. Don't say "cuckold" when Mr. Palermo, the attorney, is around. - You have this bad habit, just like your father. - Why? Dear... his wife has left him, last Sunday. Zuccarello's son died within two days. He couldn't even say his last prayer! Can'! you talk about happier things? Come, Antonio. Let's have a man-lo-man talk. Come. - Ninuzzo, do you wan! some cookies? - No, thank you. - Some coffee? - No. - Do you want some coffee? - No. - I'll give you an egg with milk. By the way, Professor Calar√© hasn't been eating for a week. He says that everything tastes like carrion. I guess he's going to die soon. You are looking well, Antonio. I think I'm suffering from angina. For God's sake, another piece of good news. Maybe not. But I do have diabetes. There's more sugar inside of me than in a piece of candied fruit. Don't make that mourning face, I'm not going to be buried yet. I'm still in good shape. Sure! Look at me! Your mother is making a tragedy out of it, but I still feel like a man. Don't lower your eyes like a girl. I don't want you to be ashamed of your father. Would you like to have a wimp as a father? I'm sure you wouldn't like to have a wimp as a father. Like your grandfather was... They say he used to pay two guys to see a naked gal, and then just leave the place. Bu! he was... almost 80 years old. I'm telling you all this because... you must get married. - Dad... - Dad! If you don't marry... what's her name? Barbara Puglisi, right? You'll be the cause of your own misfortune. But I've never even seen Barbara Puglisi! You've never seen her because when you like a girl you just turn around. You're a fool. Barbara Puglisi is very pretty. And she's honest and rich! What more do you want? I just wanted to wait a few more years. You're almost 30 and I can no longer support you in Rome. - Why, are you a poor man now? - Not really... Within 1O years my orange grove will be worth 50 million. But for the moment, your mother mus! borrow money from the caretaker. You know... I sold everything I had to buy the orange grove. You should see it. It's much more beautiful than you! Yet... eh? What have you done in Rome these past three years? You haven't accomplished anything, you just wasted a lot of money. It's not my fault. Others were luckier than me. They entered the diplomatic corps without any open competition. - I had only promises. - And your friend, the Member of Parliament'? What's his name'? Didn't he help you? - He didn't lift one finger, did he'? - He was the worst of them all. - I guess it's because you "approached" his wife... - That's not true! I don't want to know if it's true, but the poor guy never realized anything. He has more "horns" than a basket full of snails. It had to be my stupid son, coming from Catania, to make him jealous. He isn'tjealous, and I'm not in love with his wife either! It's not true! Mr. Alfio... I've heard that your son has come back from Rome! The lawyer thinks that you're the undersecretarys lover. - If he asks you if it's true... - No! - Yes! Don't deny it, or he'll believe you are. - Good morning. - He's back! - Good morning. - Welcome back. - Thank you, Sir. Hello, Elena. What's going on in that sewer that the Holy Father ought to burn to the ground? We Sicilians are always unpopular... because we are smarter than them, and smarter than everyone else who think they're better than them. Mrs. Rosaria, have you noticed your son's eyelashes? How can they be so long? They're fans, not eyelashes! - She likes you... - Madam! - Why don't you kiss him? - A kiss? - Right on his eyelids! A little above! Yes, kiss him there! Below! Let's see if he's ticklish! Please, mother, stop. I'm going to my room, I'm tired. Excuse me. What a beard! I'm sure it scratches like sandpaper. Who are you? Santuzza, the new maid. "One day I left you because of a foolish vision, "and I went far away. "I traveled across foreign lands looking for love. "I looked for love in summer and in winter. "And I never stopped looking for it. "I ran searching for love, but I didn't find it. "And I returned home, with a sore heart. " They are all very pretty, you'll see. You'll wish you could stay with them day and night. One is from Milan. Her body, cousin, is like the Venus Calipigia. Buttocks to dream about. I'm glad that you have come. Who's throwing the party? Lawyer Spam'). Actually, people say that he's no lawyer. He's from Benevento. They say that Calderara, the Member of Parliament, appointed him... head of the Cultural Society. This way all dancers that come to Catania... are easily available for his friends. - Sir! Come in, please. - Good evening. Are there many people? There's also Calderara. He's come from Rome to celebrate my boss's election to Parliament. - Who's this nice young man? - My cousin, Antonio Magnano. - How come I've never seen him before? - He arrived only yesterday from Rome. Everybody loves him there. And he doesn't need dancers like I do. I bet! All the women must be crazy about him. - Hello. - Hello, Antonio. - Welcome back, son. - Sir. - Is it true what they say about you? - What do they say? That you're lucky with women. What do you think? Do you like his kind better than me? Well, nobody could think that you're a woman! Your father can tell you what we did with these arms in 1922! A toast! To the new Member of Parliament's brilliant political future. All people in Catania are looking at him full of pride and hope. Show what you're made of! Starting tomorrow, you'll have a seat in the Palermo Parliament, representing the most Italian party that ever existed. Behave like a real man, understand? - Let's hand her to Lawyer Spam'). - Let's see what happens. Come on! "Dear lawyer", take your chance, because tomorrow she's leaving. I doubt it! Come with me, I'll make you cry. Let's see what you can do! Yes, go with the lawyer, we'll have some fun! Dear Antonio, I've heard that the lawyer can't... Really? - Lawyer, is it true that you can't... '? - It's not true! Did you hear what they say about you? Say something! I can'! believe it! Don't pay attention to what these blockheads say. - If I were you, I'd kill myself. - Yes, it's better to die. - Sure. - A thousand times better. - A million limes better! - Stop it! - No, go with him, I'll give you a nice present. - I'll tell you what I want later. - Okay, you can tell me later. - Come on, lawyer. - Let's go. - A round of applause for our lawyer! - He dropped his cousin's picture. - Who is she? You rejected her without seeing her? It's Barbara Puglisi, - the girl that your parents would like you to marry. - Come, dear. You're an angel! Young man... do you want to work in Palermo as the Federation's secretary? I'd be glad to give you the job. All those women will drive you nuts! Think about it. - You, come with me! - No! - Why not? - I've left behind those kinds of works. - What do you do now? - I'm an artist. - An artist? - Yes. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Am I bothering you? - No, why? Is it true what they say, that you have plenty of women in Rome... and that you drove a Government Secretary's wife crazy? - It's a lie. They say that women cry at your door like cats in heat! Don't listen to them. Come with me. Come. The most handsome boy in Catania. It's a shame that we have to pay our respects to someone like Calderara. 10 years ago we wouldn't even have greeted him back. Animal! How "strong" he is! He behaves like a conscript soldier on leave. I would have done the same. Bu! I immediately understood something that he didn't realize: all those women despised everyone, except for you. - Really? I'd have kissed Nanda's feet for refusing his attentions in such a classy way! He told me that he'd give ten years of his life to spend a nigh! with my friend, the undersecretary. - There's no hope, I already gave up. - Really? I would be very grateful if you could do me a favor. Antonio, are you listening to me? I'm sorry. Tell me. I saw that you're up Calderara's sleeve. Tell him to find me a job. I need to work; I'm not a young boy any more. What do you say? Sure, I'll try to help you. Good night. Mom. Dad. Ninuzzo, what's the matter? - What is it? - Are you sick? No. - What are you doing up so late? - What's the matter? - Your son smells like he's been around women. - What's the matter? I wanted to tell you that I'll marry Barbara Puglisi. Thank God! - Rosaria! - Antonio, how happy I am! Come to your mom! Give me a kiss! Remind your son that from now on, there will be none of his whores. Remind him that Barbara Puglisi has a priest in her family, that his future father-in-law comes from the most important family in Calania, and the richest too. Thanks, Antonio. Well done! You'll see: she will make a respectable wife. She's as pure as spring water. Lawyer Ardizzone! Lawyer Ardizzone! - Did you call me, Mr. Alfio'? - Yes, I want to give you some good news. My son Antonio is going to marry Barbara Puglisi. Notary Puglisi's daughter. Do you know him? Rara Avis! A unique person! - I'm happy for you. Congratulations! - Thanks. - He's done it! He's done it! - Elena! That's what happens in Catania! He's going to marry a perfect stranger before checking out his neighbour! - Elena! - That's the truth! When you live so close to a girl, you should at least look at her once... before making a mistake by going elsewhere. - Elena! I'm so unlucky! So unlucky! I was born unlucky! - My father, instead of thinking about the Senate... - What are you saying? Excuse her, dear friend. Accept my... Well... Good night. She's crazy! Poor girl! - Dad! - What do you do to women? It's their fault, they're in heal! - Well, I'm no monk, I like women too. - Yes. - Aren't you ashamed of saying so? - Well... Your grandfather liked them too, and your great-grandfather... He liked them all. He was like a lion! He didn't leave out any woman! Your usual ramblings! We, the Magnano, make all women melt when we touch them. Yes, you can go on crossing yourself. Starting from tomorrow, no Countess Cavallaro, no Government Secretary's wife, no chief editor's daughter, and no dancers. Understand? - Yes. Good. - Alfio! - I'm so happy tonight! The orchards in Paternb, the manor on the main street and, when he passes away, my brother-in-law R0sari0's vineyard. - Of course. - Gifts from our relatives worth 10 million. - Of course. And you will give your son the orchard in the plain. - No. - Of course. - No. - Of course. - Well, as you wish. - Unfortunately, as you know, the mayor wants to make a public company with our canals in Pomiciaro, and that will cost us millions. But the canals have always been ours! I talked to all my friends in Rome. The only one that can help us is Corollaro, the Member of Parliament. - That's why I'll ask your son... - Your son, starting from tomorrow. - Of course. - To write to his friend... they're friends, aren't they? Wonderful. - Now, I'll call my daughter and my wife. - It will be a pleasure. - Will you call them, Father Rosario? - Of course. Later we will go to visit my father-in-law, the Baron. - The old man is very sick. - Barbara, come. - Good evening. - Good evening, Barbara. - May I kiss your daughter's forehead? - Certainly. You're both so handsome. I wonder how beautiful your children will be! Don't you think so, Father? - Good evening, Mr. Alfio, how are you? - Very well. - Today is a wonderful day for us. - Shall we go upstairs? Dad. Dad! Mr. Alfio Magnano is here. Do you remember him'? Alfio Magnano. Alfio Magnano? You... you were a councillor when the Town Council dared... to plant the trees in from of my house. - Father! - In front of my house, blocking my view! - Such an insult to me, Baron Francesco! To me! - Father! And you didn't even plant them well. And when they died, you said I had poisoned them. You! Petty Thieves! - I... - Father! Father! It's nothing, don't worry. Let's go, he's only fainted. Let's go. He's dead. We'd better no! say anything until tomorrow. It's nothing. He'll get over it. - Poor Baron Francesco. Do you remember when he poisoned the trees? - Sure. Look at those eyelashes... - What a handsome man! - Very handsome. - Who died? - Nobody. Just a 90 year old man. I think the mayor smiled at you. Do the same. - Look, Alfie's son with his fiancee. - They're beautiful! Don't look at the balconies, remember that you're engaged! If the mayor didn't come, it means he has a guilty conscience. You'd better write today to your friend in the Parliament. - Sure, I will, but I don't know if... - Antonio! Your son is an idiot. He was about to say that he's not a friend of the Government Secretary's. - You know how modest he is. - He's plain stupid! Alfio, what are you doing? Everybody's looking at us. - There goes Barbara Puglisi. - What a great family! The greatest! She won't cheat on her husband! Excuse me, lawyer, I wasn't talking about you. Don't worry: I got rid of my wife 30 years ago! So? What's the matter, Antonio? - What's the matter with you? - I'm so happy to marry Barbara! Well... I'm sorry about what happened. - Still, they say it brings good luck. - Yes. Come. Let's go! Antonio, I'm sorry if I'm disturbing you, but your letter to the undersecretary had an immediate effect. You already knew? Then, remember what I asked you for. Don't forget about it! I'm glad I'll go to Rome. Don't forget to give me a few addresses. You'll have to start a kindergarten for all the typists' sons. - He won't leave out any girl! - Don't listen to him. He's fooling around. Are you alone? - Yes, I'm alone. - Guess who's here with us? I wan! you to hear a voice. Antonio, don't you remember me? - Antonio! - Why don't you come here? Tell my friends to leave me alone. I can't. Goodbye. I'm sorry. - Who was it? - My father. He wanted to know if I had the key to the main door. One day we should go and see your orange grove. Have you already dug the well? - I think so. - You 'think so'? - It's your well. It's important to have your own water. - You're right. I'll take care of everything later. How many orange trees do you have'? I don't know... 20,000. - A magnificent properly! - Yes. Madam, do you need anything'? - No, Maria, you can go. - Good night. - Maria, don't forget to bring a jug of fresh water to my room. - Very well. I'm retiring too. Your father will slay here with you. - Pino, I'm going to bed. Good night. - Good night. I'm so happy! God knows how many women you've met in Rome. You have a bad reputation. No, not in Rome, you don't know, you don't know... An indissoluble tie that no human or earthly force... could ever undo. But remember: there is no relationship between husband and wife, or between mother and son, or between two brothers, or between two friends, where Christ is not present. Your names are now being written in the book of Heaven... one next to the other. Nobody will ever be able to erase them. The wife will obey her husband the same as The Lord, because man is a woman's master, as Christ is the master of the Church. Man will leave his parents, and will stay with his wife and they will be one flesh. But don't forget that nothing can be hidden... Are you happy? I'm proud. And you? Yes. You can go now, husband and wife, with God's blessing. - Where are they going to live? - In the country. In his father's house. It's pretty and very sunny. Thanks. Excuse me. Come on, Elena. Let's go. Best wishes! Barbara Puglisi, make him happy. He's not a man you find every day. - The car is coming. - Welcome, Sir. - Welcome, Sir Antonio. - Thanks. Hand the flowers to the young lady. Best wishes. - Your mother doesn't look like a 70-year old woman. - Actually, she's 93! Come. - I'll take the briefcase. - She's the new maid, Sir Antonio. - Al your service, Madame. - What's your name? - Francesca. - I'm a widow, and I had seven sons. - Seven? - They're all dead. One died after 2 months, another after 3, another after 4... bu! I had seven. How many children would you like to have'? - Carmela. - Do you like I! here? Let's go, I think the young Sir... I know how the Magnano are. My angel. Barbara. My love. Enough. How many kisses are you going to give me? You're always kissing me. I think you've given me a million kisses in the past three months. Wait for me. I'll go fetch some oranges. Francesca! Madame, what's wrong with you? Are you feeling ill? - No, I'm fine. - After three months, that's how things begin. - What things? - A child's birth. - We've decided not to have children. - No children? That's a sin! It's a sin! God wants every husband and wife to have children! - How do you have children, Francesca'? - What? You're asking me? With a husband like yours? Mother of God, it's unbelievable! "How do you have children"? What do you do with your husband at night? Will you tell me? It's the same for the animals. Yes, like a rooster with his hens! Haven't you ever seen them'? Antonio! What is it? What's the matter with you? We mus! fire Francesca immediately. I don't want to see her any more. - What did she do? - She mus! leave immediately! She told me horrible things. I don't want to see her any more. Yes, sure. Of course, my love. Sir Antonio! She's here, at the gate. Sanluzza, come. - Welcome. - Thank you. How are my parents? Are they doing well? They're fine. - Were they angry when I asked for you to come here? - A little, Sir Antonio. May n Here you'll be fine, you'll have less work too. This is your room. - Barbara, my love... good morning. - Good morning, Ninuzzo. How beautiful you are, each day a bit more. You're not of this world, you're an angel. You've told me so many times, I'm starting to believe it. - Do you love me, Barbara? - You're my husband, how could I not love you? I mean, do you still love me? Do you still love me after what Francesca told you? Now that you know... Answer me. - I love you even more. - Aren't you lying, Barbara? You don't know how much I love you. - Are you sure you're not lying? - No, I'm not. Will you still love me a year from now? Forever? - Will you love me, in spite of everything? - I'll always love you, why should it change? You will always be my husband. What? They're always together, why shouldn't they get along? Okay, Mr. Notary. You're always welcome. Mr. Puglisi is coming here - he wants to talk to me. Have you heard, Rosaria? Stop torturing those poor saints. I did the right thing waking up early today. Mr. Puglisi told me that Antonio does not behave very well, that things are going badly between him and Barbara. You should have heard his voice when he told me he wanted to talk to me. God help us! What did you answer? That I'd be waiting for him and I asked him to bring two cigars, since my wife forgot. - This isn't the time to be thinking about such things! Do you want me to start mourning because my son is like a rooster with his wife? He enjoys himself and I should listen to complaints? My son has married a woman he likes, and he has every right to love her. I think it's pretty clear, isn't it? If my son likes his daughter, he shouldn't interfere. Or have they been married using dirty water? In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. What are you saying? What does he want? He knew my son was a real man! With everything... You open the door. Mother of God, help us! - What are you afraid of? - I don't know, but I don't like these matters. Rosaria, don't bother me. Go! Tell him to come in. What are you waiting for? - Please, come in. - Good morning. - Make yourself at home. - My husband is waiting for you. - Thanks. Rosa, hang St. Agata's picture up. Right, put it back. - She adores her saints. - Ah. Have you brought me the cigars? So, what's the matter, Mr. Puglisi? Things aren't going well between our children. Actually, I meant to call you for the same reason. - Really? - Yes. Have you heard... you know that here in Catania nobody minds their own business... I heard that... Barbara is unhappy. - It's impossible. - Believe me, we shouldn't overreact. In my opinion... parents shouldn't interfere with their children's problems. - To a certain extent. - Yes, of course. If things would go beyond a certain limit, if she started to feel ill... Then we could both talk to Antonio and make him understand that... well... Mr. Alfio, words are useless in such circumstances. Sir, we are not animals, we're baptized Christians. If Barbara suffers, Antonio will be the first one to be worried. Barbara is suffering, but only morally. I don't understand why Barbara should be suffering morally. I don't think that being too affectionate can be an offense. It's not like that. - What do you mean? - It's not like that. It isn't? What's the matter, then? I thought you suspected something. It will be harder and very painful for me to explain it. Notary... Tell me everything. ls my son ill? I don't know if we can say that, but his condition... His condition? What's wrong with him? Tell me, what's the matter? Take it easy, please. His health is not in danger. Antonio is well, but... But what'? Mr. Notary, please... please, speak clearly. What happened? My daughter, after 12 months of marriage, is still "untouched"! Un... touched. - Untouched?! - Yes. Like I said. That's impossible! It's impossible! I wouldn't believe it, even if I saw it with my own eyes! Do you know why I was appointed federal of Catania? Because I slept with 9 women in one night. How can you be such a fool as to believe this nonsense? - Who told you? - Certainly not my daughter. - Antonio has proved himself too 'light'. - Be careful with your words. I know Antonio. I know him! He's always been a Casanova. Why would it be different with his wife? Why? Why? - I don't know why. - Anyway, I'm warning you! All this must remain within this room. Nobody must know about it. - And then? - Then... We'll see how things really are. - I must talk to my son. - Of course. That's your duty. You must defend your son's interests, just as I must defend my daughter's. But my son's and your daughter's interests... are the same. They would be if they were really husband and wife. Why? Didn't they get married properly? A marriage like this is like it never happened. - It's null and void. - Null and void? You say that because it suits you! - It's not me. It's the Church that says it. - The Church? Whose Church? - When did they say that? - Not yet, but they will. My dear Notary, you disgust me. You have a dirty soul. Your heart is as hard as a stone. You vomit black ink, like a squid. - Mr. Alfio, if you go on like this, I'll leave! - Do it! Go away! Listen well... I don't believe a single word of what you said. I'll talk to Antonio and we'll see. Yes, talk to your son. Goodbye. - Greetings to your wife. - She doesn't give a damn about your greetings. Just keep them. Have you heard? Liar! Slanderer! Can you believe it... our Antonio! No. No! No. He should tell his customers. Those few suckers that always listen to him. Not me. No. I'm going crazy. We are sitting here with broken hearts, instead of doing what we should. - What? - Alfio... we should talk to Antonio. Yes. You're right. That's right. I'll talk l0 him. Come. - What's his number? - You already know: 17420. No, I don't know. I wish I never knew. A number that starts with a 17! - Give me my glasses. - You're wearing them. I can't see anything. Dial the number. I hope that the Notary doesn't answer. Because I'd make him bite his tongue. Hello? - Is it you, dad? - Antonio? - Yes, it's me. - Antonio... - What's the matter, dad? He's asking me what the matter is. Antonio... He's surprised. I knew it was all bullshit. You'll see... So, is everything okay? No news? - Not that I know of. - Nothing at all? No, nothing. Because... I'm calling you to tell you that your father-in-law is a scoundrel. - Why are you saying that? - This morning, he came to me and broke my heart, saying certain things... - ls there anybody there with you? - Yes, but speak up! He's mad, he ought to be locked up, that scoundrel. Everything he said... Just thinking of it, it makes me sick. Do you know what he dared to tell me, here in this room'? He said that Barbara... that Barbara is still untouched, the way she was when she left her house. Untouched! Antonio? Sir Antonio! - What is it? - Nothing. - Are you feeling ill? - Go. Go away. - Why did you go to visit my father? - My son, I couldn't do otherwise. Something bad's happened. What else can we do? Why did you go to my father? What do you know? Answer me! I know everything. - Everything? - Yes, everything. Why didn't you come and talk to me'? We could have... What? I'm familiar with this kind of situation. We must convince Barbara. - To do what'? - To realize what she really is: a young lady that never got married. That will be Barbara's decision, not mine nor yours! She's a sensible woman and she will know what to do. Did you know that your father went to visit mine, today? - Yes, I know. - Since when? - I was told later. So, your father makes such an important decision without asking you? - Tell me, Barbara: do you approve of him? Answer me! - Yes. We swore that we'd go on loving each other anyway, even more. - You said that God blessed our house. - Now I know that the Church doesn't. - Why, are we hurting anyone? - Nobody. But our marriage doesn't exist in God's eyes. - When did you realize this? - When the Archbishop explained it to me. - Did you talk to him about this? - Yes, seven days ago. How did it happen? Why did you tell your father? It was Francesca, when we fired her last summer. I had to confirm everything. Why is he worrying about I! only now, since he discovered it months ago? - He clearly has some plans for you. - I don't know. Barbara, where has your love for me gone? Answer me! Where has your love for me gone? I will always love you, but not as a wife. - Why not? - Because we aren't husband and wife. - Since when? - We've never been. I didn't know that before, bu! now I do. Since I've been told, I've started blushing when I'm with you. - Barbara, no... - We must confess our mistake to the Church, in order to fix everything. - How? - By nullifying our marriage. Because we cheated. Yes, we cheated. - You shouldn't have listened, mom! - Barbara! - You shouldn't have! Antonio. We can't go on like this. Don't be like this; don't despair. Antonio. I'll kneel down before Barbara and her father, if I offended them. No, dear, it's not your fault. There's no need to kneel down before anybody. My dear Antonio, handsome as the sun. Antonio. Antonio. Leave him be, he wants to be alone. I'm going crazy. How is it possible? What does it mean? What happened? What happened, Antonio? Why? Did he talk to you? You must talk to me! I'm your father. You must... talk to me. Tell me something. Tell me: is Barbara... like all the other women? Yes, sure. All women are alike. You have to accept it. Maybe... we can still do something about it. You shut up. You did it on purpose, right? You didn't want to, did you? - Answer me! - Don't answer, Antonio! It doesn't matter, dear. Leave him alone. If he wants to talk, he'll talk. Antonio, please. Is it true you did it on purpose? Yes father, I did it on purpose. Thank God. I don't wan! to know anything else. I know what mus! be done. Me too. Hello? Is that you, Sir Notary? This is Alfio Magnano. I want to make you a proposal. Come with me and my son to visit a woman today. Yes, a woman! You will realize that he isn't impotent at all! You understand? I'll let you talk to Barbara, if you wish, but she has a heart of stone. - What do you mean? - A heart that God made to confuse us priests. Her feelings are honest; we can only approve and admire her. But if I listen to my heart, I wouldn't allow that girl to go to Church. Father, let me talk to her. She's in the sacristy - you can meet her immediately, but it'd be useless. Her nose has already smelled the scent of money. - What do you mean? - The Duke of Bronte, who will marry Barbara... when her marriage with Antonio is nullified, has billions. I understand. Sometimes I feel guilty, because the Lord listened to me when I asked him to cool my son off, since he was such a Casanova. The Lord answered: "Do you want me to cool him off'? He'll be made of ice. " Maybe the Lord has decided to punish me by shaming me so. It's not a shame. Your son has neither killed, nor robbed, nor taken someone else's wife. Yes, it's a shame. That's why the Church says we're wrong. The Church didn't say that, it's only nullifying the marriage. Do you think that's a minor thing'? That's what Barbara, the Notary and the Duke want. Even the archbishop has forgotten everything my husband did for him. Nobody will help me now. Not even you, Father Raffaele'? Madam, that's unfair. I'm a sinner and I'm willing to kiss your son's feet. Barbara should kiss my son's feet, not you, Father. How confused you are, Madame. You can go, Mrs. Rosaria. - Antonio must apologize, because he offended me. - What are you saying? What are you saying? How did he offend you? I loved him, and I thought he loved me too. Why? Isn't it true? No... Now I know, I'm not a little girl anymore. - What do you know? - What a married woman must know. Explain yourself. Antonio has never loved me. He's treated me like a piece of wood. - His eyes glittered when he looked at you! - He despised me. Tell me why, otherwise I'll think you're making up an excuse. An excuse? Then why did he treat me like this? Barbara, we are both married women, you are no little girl, A! your age, I already had a 12 year old boy. It's not my fault if I have no children, Madam. Be careful, girl. Don't be rude. I am a kind person, but I don't accept these poisonous words from a Puglisi. - Goodbye. - Wail! Don'! think you can impress me. You can stand up, sit down, lay down or stand upside down, but we won't move until you tell me the truth. - You know the truth. - Shut up, I'll talk now. I don't believe that Antonio despised you. You well know that Antonio doesn't despise you, he loves you. - But... - No buts! Something bad has happened to him, it could happen to anybody. Do you know when it happens? It happens when you love too much, when your heart beats too fast. When you think that the one you love belongs to heaven. - But I don't belong to heaven. - Let me speak! You weren't dying, you could have waited a bit more. You weren't on your deathbed! I thought you would sympathize with me, knowing what I went through. What did you go through, Barbara? You're telling me? My husband went to war after 20 clays of marriage. I waited for him patiently for 2 years, without complaining. I never thought about... that! I'm not here to let you offend me. I understand. You shouldn't have talked to her. You shouldn't have given her this satisfaction. I've learned how to talk to the Puglisi, those dirty pigs. Barely opening your mouth, as they always do. I have a few things to tell them, when I meet one of them...! - Go home alone. - Alfio, you can'! do anything against those sly people. I said go home and leave me alone! Father! Father Rosario! Good morning, Father. You're an expert, would you explain this to me? How can the Church nullify a marriage for such an ordinary reason? Dear Alfio, I'm no expert at all. I won't meddle in young people's affairs. It's their problem and they have to find a solution. I've nothing to do with it. I want to know about it as a general issue, not because of my son's involvement. Dear friend, let's talk as good Christians and relatives. I understand your pain and your outrage, but... Let's go inside; we can talk better there. Will you explain to me how the Church can nullify a marriage... only because husband and wife don't accomplish the act... Does the Church wan! them night and day to... - Marriage is a sacrament! - Indeed. Something sacred can't be broken just because the husband hasn't... - Please! Nonsense! - Is that what marriage is all about, then? No, it's not. Marriage is a sacrament. In a marriage, husband and wife are the agents. The priest only consecrates them. Very well. Bu! where is it written that if the husband doesn't want to... then the sacrament is nullified? - Don't talk like that. Marriage has both a spiritual element and a material one. Very well... what if one believes marriage to be only a spiritual union, what would the Church say? In marriage, the physical act is as sacred as the spiritual one. "Caro una sanguis unus". - Be clear, Father. - "One flesh, one blood". Nice refrain, now that you've set your eyes on the Bronle's lands. When my son and I were practising "caro una sanguis unus" with other women, why did you get so upset in your confessionals? You don't want to reason! You were practising "caro una sanguis unus" with other men's women! - Yes, bu! they were happy to be with us. - I beg you not to say such things! - I can say whatever I want. - Then I'll leave. - And I will shame you in the streets! - You can't say anything about me! - I'll say that the Puglisi's flesh is sold to the highest bidder. - You're wrong! - I'm not! - Yes! - No! - Yes! - No! Good evening, is my cousin Antonio here? He has measles, nobody can get close to him. Not even his wife. Because Miss Barbara never had it when she was a child, so... Well... I can still talk to him through the door. No, nobody can go in. How pretty you are! Small, bu! pretty. I love tiny girls. Where are you going? Come here. Come here! Are you scared? Raise your head, let me take a look at you. Mr. Antonio doesn't want to meet anybody. - Then let me talk to his father. - Nobody can go in. Mr. Antonio doesn't want to meet anybody. I can't do anything about it. Santuzza, who is it? - Hello, aunt. - Edoardo, it's you! How are you? - You're back. - Yes. - Heaven sent you here! - Have you heard? - Yes. Eduardo . You can help us. Antonio trusts you. We don'! even dare to talk to him anymore. You'll be God on earth to me if you manage to make him tell me the truth. I'll try. Don't worry. - Who is it? - It's me, Antonio. How are you? Come, Edoardo. You're back. How are you? Well... Don't tell me that you also think that I've changed? Everybody says so. - How have you changed? - Well... I feel disgusted. Only disgusted. I'm resigning from the position that I got with your help. Now I know who are really my fellow countrymen and men in general. Believe me... people are evil... and they scare me, Antonio. Now I understand why you've come back from Rome. - You know that my wife is going to marry the Duke of Bronte? - I know. - Why do you think they're doing it? - The Brontes are very rich. It's the only thing that counts nowadays, you know it too. - Do you still have the "600" car'? - No, I was tired of it and I changed it. I bought a bigger car, I don't even know why. I've been shut in here for a month. I only see Santuzza. I don't know anything about the world outside any more. Edoardo, take me outside! Let's go for a walk! - Don't you want to talk'? - About what? About your wife, about what happened, about you. There's nothing to say. When I left Catania, Antonio, I gave everything up. I have nothing left. I mean morally. Fortunately, I still have an income from my mother's lands. That's the reason why I don'! care and I will still be a conservative. The thing that's less painful to keep is Catanizrs misery. At least here everybody knows each other. We know we're wolves. At least, all the ancient things are noble. You're complaining? You have discovered that men are evil, that they bribe and can be bought. I don't care about their political colour: red or black... - They've had something that I've never had. - Never? - Never! That's right! - How can that be? - Never with someone I liked, with a woman that I really cared for. Well, not with those, but with all the others... I must confess that it's happened to me too... Sometimes... Not always, not even often, but... Sometimes... When you're always riding, sometimes you have to fall down. I used to make love in my dreams until I was 18. Then, one day, only halfway through... in a house in Mattera street. That night I threw up. From that moment on, it's never occurred again. Neither in my dreams, nor halfway through. Every time I went to that alley, I fell sick, as when you feel seasick. At the same time I was in love with every woman. How can it be? I don't understand. All the women were crazy about you. That's what you used to say, but I saw things differently. When I went to Rome, something new happened. The night when I arrived I went to one of those houses, and I finally managed to be a man before feeling sick. - Good, and then? I was so excited that I stepped out, feeling dizzy. I kissed every door and every wall along the street, from that place to my house. That was the best time in my life. I was young. Women loved me and I was able, sometimes, to make a few of them crazy with joy. Servants, whores, students... - Then one day I met a woman. - Go on. She was beautiful, an angel. She wasn't a creature of this world. - You exaggerate! - Her name was Paola. I met her a! a friend of mine's. I started dating her. She was my first love. Didn't you try anything with her? I used to spend the whole afternoon with one of those girls. - But with Paola... - Did you make love to her or not? One night, in the car, I kissed her passionately. Although I had spent the whole afternoon with that woman, I fell... I felt that drive again... You do go on a bit, don't you! We got to her house and before going upstairs... Skip the details. Tell me the rest in the right order. - What room did she take you to? - To her bedroom. - Straight there? - Yes. - What did you do then? Tell me. I turned off the light and we hugged each other. I suddenly felt a horrible cold that penetrated my body and paralyzed me. She sat on the bed, and I lay down beside her, with my mouth against the sheets. My lips were trembling. I haven't been able to do it since, neither with her nor with others. Not even with the women I fell in love with. And there have been lots of them! Bu! I've never loved anyone like I love Barbara. I was sure... to succeed with Barbara. I was sure. That's why I married her. How beautiful she is! Why isn't she wearing a white veil? - It's her second wedding. - Is she a widow? No, her first husband is still alive, but they say he's no! a 'real man'. Edoardo, you know everything, you must tell me the truth. I don't know. Antonio is a bit ill. I don't believe it. He pretended. It's not possible to pretend something so dull for so many months. He must do something. He must! Otherwise I'll break his face. He must have a mistress, two, three, four! Give him a hundred if you wish so, bu! I advise you against it. So, should we just stay here without doing anything? Are we going to let everybody spit in our faces? We shouldn't push it too far, especially when we're on the wrong side. Then I no longer have a son! My son is dead! I had a son, but now he's dead! Antonio is dead! Scoundrels! Blood-sucking thieves! Unchristened bandits! You've bought people and justice with your money! With your dirty money, you've found other thieves, worse than you! Dirty miserable bigots plundering our beautiful land! You agreed and made a deal just as you wanted! Do as you wish, bu! there will be a time when... - Let's go, uncle. - when I'll spit in your face again! - A time when men... - Let's go. Thieves! Hypocrites! Dirty scoundrels! Down with the Government! Down with the Government! - Do you want to have a good time? - Leave me alone, old bitch. He did it on purpose. Give me a light. - There you are. - Thanks. Grandpa, go to bed... you could have a heart attack! I wish I could die this way! Everybody must know that Alfio Magnano at the age of 60 still goes with women! Open up, Mariuccia. Good evening, Mr. Alfio. What are you doing here? Tomorrow, people will say that you spend your nights here. That's right! I wan! all of Catania to know... that Alfio Magnano at the age of 60 still goes with women! - What if you end it all right here? - What do you mean? If you have a heart attack? It's fairly easy at your age. I'm a lion. Years ago, when I happened to enter a bar, all of the husbands told their wives to leave. - That's a long time ago. In case you want to know, a few years ago I had another son. A son'? Who was the mother? A cashier. - Where is he now'? - He's dead. Do you really think that my only son is Antonio, that idiot? Many cheated husbands have brought up Alfio Magnands children. - Who are your other sons'? - Judge Rossino. - What? - Do you know him? - Sure, he's a nice fellow, but a little stingy. When I was a young girl he used to pay me with a hard-boiled egg. And the High School's vice-principal. - That old bag? - That's right. And another one, a Navy Officer, but he's on his ship right now. - A Navy Officer? - Yes. I wish I had a heart attack! People would say: "Alfio Magnano died fulfilling his duty." As you wish, Mr. Alfio. As you wish. Alfio, my love, my life. Madame, dinner is served. Madame. How can I think of eating, or sleeping, when my love is laying dead in that bed? Samuzza'? Santuzza, what is it? My God, Santuzza! Santuzza? Santuzza! Wake up! Talk to me! What's the matter? Antonio! Antonio, Santuzza doesn't feel good! Santuzza, what is it? What is it? - I feel ashamed. - You feel ashamed? - What are you ashamed of? - I feel ashamed. What did you do? Are you pregnant? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why? I've always been like a mother to you. Now it's too late to cry or to feel ashamed. What is done is done. Who was it? Who was it? Who could that scoundrel be? That son of a dog! I haven't let you out of my sight since you arrived. - It happened in the country, right? - Yes. - Was it Nunzio, that old pig'? - No. - Turiddu, his son? - No. - A bum, a field-worker? - No, no. Who was it? Who, for the sake of Saint Genoveffa? I've already thought of everyone who was there! Antonio! Ninuzzo! Ninuzzo! You got her pregnant! Alfio... it was him! - Sanluzza. - It was him! It was him! Forgive me, Sir Antonio. Everybody must know! He would have it this way! Come! Lawyer Ardizzone! Lawyer Ardizzone! - Senator! - What's the matter, Mrs. Rosaria? - Have you heard the news? - Tell me. - Antonio got Santuzza pregnant! Antonio! She was untouched, she was throwing up! She had never even thought about men! Untouched! Yes! Antonio! - Antonio? - He's over there! Bravo! Bravo, Antonio! I knew it. I was the only one to say so. I always said so. Bravo, my love. - You were too handsome! - Elena, you're checking me, please. Thank you very much. - Congratulations, young man. - Thank you. - May I come in? - Come in, aunt Giuseppina. Antonio! - Is it true? - Yes, it was Antonio! - It was Antonio! - Where's the... - There. It's true! It's true! - Will you marry her? - Yes, of course. - What name will you give him? - Alfio! What kind of question is that? Alfio! Alfio! Alfio! You... now you have only one thing to think about. We have to celebrate, even though we're still mourning, right? Come... Come, aunt Giuseppina. There. Make yourself comfortable. Santuzza! Sanluzza, dear, bring the glasses. Where will they live? Here, with you? Sure. They'll stay with me. - I wish Alfio were here! - But he's watching us. He's watching us! - Antonio, is it you? - Yes. - I'm Eduardo, I've heard the news. - I'm happy for you. - Happy? Why should I be happy? But, Antonio... everybody in Catania knows about it! And Barbara? Don't you realize that I'm thinking of Barbara? That I'm crying for her? Barbara! Barbara! Can't you think of anything else? There are many other important things. After one lost love, there's a new life waiting for you. Full and rich. A family like everybody else. The house, the orange grove... and your son, Antonio. Your son! By the way, I want to be Alfie's godfather. Don't forget it. When we go to Church to baptize him, I want to hold him high over my head, so that every gossiper in the city can see him and die of jealousy. Antonio, are you listening? At last you'll be able to be what you really are: a man. Antonio, without that damned obsession that gives you no rest all day and night, You can be like everybody else. Antonio!
