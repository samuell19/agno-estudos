The Hallucination of Ulysses Come up here, Dedalus! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Dedalus? Here is my dear brothers the real Christ body, soul, the blood and guts. Slow music, please Silence all! Tell me, Mulligan! Yes, my dear! How long is Haines will this tower? He thinks you is not a gentleman. Ah, that pesky English! Bursting with money and indigestion, because it comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus? He does not understand. If he stays here, go away! Hey, lend me your handkerchief so I wipe my razor. The bard's scarf! The new color for the Irish poets green snot. Can you imagine the taste? My aunt believes you killed your mother. He could have knelt down, when his dying mother asked, Dedalus. I imagine his mother, pleading with his last breath, so that you kneel and prayed for her. There is something sinister in you. Even a Jesuit education creates strange things. Ah, poor doggy! I'll give you some shirts and some scarves. How are going breeches of the second hand? Thanks, but I can not use them. Are gray. Ah, can not use them! Etiquette is etiquette! He kills his mother, but can not use gray pants. Look at you, his dreadful bard! What do you have against me? SPIT! Remember the first time I went to your house, after the death of my mother? Her aunt asked who was in her room. - What I said? "Ah, Dedalus, whose mother died stupidly. " I said that? And what's wrong with that? I think the death beast. I see dead in droves, every day being processed in casings in the dissecting room. That's pretty beast that's it. You do not knelt on his deathbed and yet is upset with me. What nonsense! I said it, but declined offend the memory of his mother. I'm not thinking on offense to my mother. - What, then? - On the offense to me. - You're impossible! - Are you there, Mulligan? I'm coming! Do not be sad about it all day. Let the bad mood away. Haines wants breakfast each morning. He finds it very smart. Tickle it with a changed, okay? I got paid, this morning. At school? It was enough? Lend us a little, let's take a nice drop. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I'll tell you something, Mulligan, you make a very strong tea. As the old mother Grogan said, when I make tea, I make tea when I make water, I make water! - My God, it is tea! - "Is this what I do, Mrs Cahill, she said. Attention: Mrs. Cahill, God sent it, do not use the teapot. " Put on your book as an indication of Stephen, This is folk art! Seriously, Dedalus, I'm broken. Just go to school And bring me some the money they owe me. Today's poets should drink and dream. Yes .. Today, Ireland expects his men to do their duty. I need to visit your national library today. But first, let's get to our dive! This is the day their monthly bath, Dedalus? The dirty poet undertakes to wash once a month. All Ireland is washed by the Gulf Stream. I intend to use your phrases such in my book, if you please. - Will I be paid for it? - Well, that I can not say. Oh, wait until you hear his theory of Hamlet, Haines. Come on, Dedalus! Have you eaten all we left. What is your theory about Hamlet? No! I am not qualified to do so! You could not understand it without drinking a little, right? It's simple. He proves mathematically that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather, and that he himself, is the spirit of his father. What? Himself? A little drink of anything, can loosen the tongue of Dedalus. I once read a theory about such thing as a father and son the child is struggling to be rewarded by her father. I think we should not laugh, He is blaspheming. - How did he call it? - The ballad of joking Jesus. Oh, you had heard? About 3 times a day after meals. You're not a believer, is it? I mean, a believer in the sense strict word. It seems to me that the word has only one meaning. Yes, of course. Believe it or not, right? Whoever stole the poor Thus Spake give Mr. Zarathrusta! Secretly, I do not believe the idea of a personal God. You also do not believe, I imagine. You're giving me a bad example of free thought. I dare say that you like Irish, should think so. In England, we know that treat them unfairly, and it seems to me that we can blame history. I'm English, and I think as such. I do not want my country fall into the hands of a Jew. I believe this be a problem now. Poldy? Hurry this tea, I'm thirsty! But it takes! Who are the letters? Can I open the curtains? Is it good? Who sent the letter? Ah, the Boylan! Him .. he is bringing The program for the concert this afternoon. At 4 o'clock. What to sing? Ah, "La ci" give and "Love's Old Sweet Song." You. .. or to open the window a little? What time is the funeral Paddy Dignam? I think it's at 11. I have not read the newspaper. Give me ... No! No, the book! He must have fallen! I wanted to ask him about a word. Here. What does it mean? Metempsychosis? Yes, who or what is it? Metempsychosis is Greek. The Greek. Means ... the transmigration of souls. Ah, that great! Speak my language! "... The monster Maffei desisted, and the victim walked away with a curse ... " - Are you finished? - Yes, and there's nothing obscene. She is passionate the first guy all the time? I have not read. You want another? I want to. Bring another of Paul de Kock's. What a beautiful name it has! Reincarnation, that is the word! Some people believe we continue to life in another body after death and others who have lived before. Some say they remember of past lives. It smells burned, left something on fire? The kidney! Hockey! Mr. Daesy asked me to remove my doubts with you. - You can not do alone? - No, sir. 6, takes one. Stupid and ignorant. Still, someone loves you. Put him in your arms and his heart. Moreover, the rest of the world misses. A leading zero. Still, he is loved. Although with its weakness, with full force. Understand now? Can you get 2 of your own? I was like him, graceful and needy. My childhood was by my side. They are very simple. Yes, sir. Thanks. Come on, Mr. Deasy calls. There you are. Hockey! Mr Dedalus, let's settle the score. I'm counting. - 3 and 12. - Thank you, sir. Do not hold so will lose! - Buy one of these here. - My would always be empty. Why not save! You know what's reason of pride for the English? Pay the bills alone. Never borrowed a penny. Can you feel it? Can? - At the moment, no. - I knew not. But one day feel. We are generous, but we also have to be fair. I fear these words, that make us so unhappy. You consider me an old conservative? I have rebel blood too. We are sons of Irish kings! Alas! Mr Dedalus, you would do me a favor with his literary friends? I have here a letter to the press, It is a disease foot and mouth. Take a look. "I can invade your space valuable, foot and mouth - To get to the point ... " - I measure not words, is not it? Take the bull by the horns in all directions thank the hospitality of your columns ... I want it printed! I am surrounded by difficulties, intrigue of ... You can write, Mr Dedalus, England is in the hands of Jews as we are here. Jewish merchants working for the destruction. A merchant is the one who buys cheap and sells dear, - Jew or gentile, is not it? - They sinned against the light! - Who has not sinned? - What do you mean? History is a nightmare which I am trying to awake. The laws of the Creator are not equal to ours. The whole story has always had the same direction - The manifestation of God! - That's God! - What? - A shout in the street! I predict that you will not be this job for long. Well, if you can publish it at once. I know two editors slightly. We'll talk tomorrow. Have a nice day, sir. Ah, Mr Dedalus? I just wanted to talk about what they say Ireland has the honor of being the only country that does not chase Jews. Did you know that? No. - Why? - Why, sir? Because I never allowed in! Never allow your input! - Bloom Hello! - What are the new ones? Is the paper today? I want to see if the French won anything else. Where's the book on the subject? Do you have any ... ... No problem, I hope? It means ... Oh no! Today is the funeral of Paddy Dignam. Yeah, poor guy. A pity! Well, come on, what can we do? The wife is doing well, I believe? Ah, yes! Very well, thank you. She will sing in a big fair in Ulster Hall, Belfast, 25 days. Really? Who will produce? Ah ... is like a tour. Formed a committee ... ... Boylan was, you know? You know him! Ah, Boylan will produce? Well, it's good news. - You can keep ... - Oh, wait let me see, wait! - You can throw away when finished. - What? Play when finished, I would even play. Thanks ... to have borrowed. Ineluctable modality of the visible. At least, if not more, wandered through my eyes. Symbols, all I'm here for; roe and kelp; the approach of the tide; rusted hull. Close your eyes and see! I'm doing me good in the dark. My sword is ash beside me. Strike it. They beat! The sound is solid! Now open your eyes! I will open, just a moment. I'm going to eternity on Sandymount shore? And all vanished since? And if I open and you are forever in the dark? Enough! I see if you can! There, all the time without you and always will be. World without end! One of her sorority, I screeched to life. Creation from nothing. Wife and partner Adam Kadmon, Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel. Amaze! Belly without blemish, bulging, defender of parchment stretched. No! White corn, Eastern and immortal, eternal wandering of the eternal. Womb of sin. In the dark the womb of sin, I was also. Created, not forged. For them! A man with my voice and my eyes, and a ghost ashes with the breath. They united and separated, the will of the coupler. I can not forget the letter to the press. And then? The Bar 12:30. Moreover, this is easy with this money, as a good young imbecile. Yes I must. My hat Latino soldier. God, we simply we should dress the character. Ah! Just say the natural way: "When I was in Paris, Boul Mich, I used to ...". What a great luggage brought back, curiosity to a blue French telegram: "Mother dying come home, Dad. " Mulligan's aunt thinks you killed your mother. The room and cold domed tower waits. I will not sleep there when night comes. Mulligan rescued a man from drowning and you fear a dog barking. You would do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifesaver. Would do or not? Truth! Say! I would like, I try. I am not a good swimmer. Water, cold, softness. Soft eyes, soft hand, soft, tender. I am lonely here. Ah, touch me soon, now! What is that word known to all men? I'm quiet and lonely here. Sad too. Tap. Touch me! This is a great old custom. Glad to know that is not dead. So look through your friend, Dedalus! - Who? - Your son and heir. That Mulligan boor was with him? No! He even went alone. He is with the ratings down. Mulligan is a damn criminal. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with God's help and of His blessed Mother, I still write a letter any day, for his mother, or aunt, or whoever, that will open your eyes. I predict its downfall, believe me! I will not allow his nephew bastard ruin my son. Numb by his son. He's right, something to cling to. If Rudy had lived. Must have been that morning, Raymond, she was at the window watching 2 dogs doing it incessantly. - The increasing desire it. - Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins. And then it grows. My son inside her. I could have helped her in life. I could. - What is the problem? - We stopped. - Where are we? - In the grand canal. - Oh, the weather is changing. - You are unpredictable as baby's bottom. We went back to walking. - How are you? - He is not seeing. Ah, yes it is! - How are you? - Who? Blazes Boylan. There he is, taking a breath. - Sad! A child! - Poor thing. Better not to live. Hmm .. but they say the worst is the man who takes his own life. Temporary insanity, of course! We must have a charitable view. They say that man that does this is cowardly. Well, we should not judge. I was disturbed to see him talking about suicide before Bloom. - What? Why? - His father poisoned himself. My God! I learned now. Poisoned herself? Hey, who's the guy behind us? He is familiar to me. Bloom. Madame Molly Bloom was ... is, I mean, the soprano. - She is your wife. - Ah, I knew it! I danced with her for 15 or 17 years ago, and she was a great partner. There is a history, that two drunks came here a night of fog, look for the grave of a friend. They asked for Mulcahy and were informed of the location of the grave. After wandering through the smoke, they found the tomb. A drunk read the name Terence Mulcahy, and the other was looking at the statue of our Saviour the widow built. After looking at the sacred figure said: "It looks nothing like the man. Not Mulcahy, whoever did this! " Close the door! Has a hurricane out there! Oh, on the announcement of Keys. He wants two calls at the top. We can do it. You have the design? Well, I can pick up at the library. He was in the newspaper Kilkenny. We do, yes. Ask Him to give us three months to renew the contract. - Well, I was going to go there. So go! The world is ahead of you! Thank you, sir. Who wants a guess for the Gold Cup? Sceptre is the horse! Entrez, mes enfants! - Whose is it? - From Mr Garrett Deasy. - Good morning, Stephen! - Good morning! - Disease of the foot and mouth. - The letter is not mine. - Mr. Garrett asked me ... - Oh, I know. I also know his wife, more than the old Tatar God I also know his wife, more than the old Tatar God already done. By Jesus, she had disease foot and mouth, for sure! I want to write me something. Something provocative! Disease of the foot and mouth that sucks! Involve everyone, Father, Son, Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy. Let me keep. Gentlemen, may I suggest that the house transfer services? For that particular site? My vote is the Mooney's! On this subject, he will renew two months and not 3, but he wants a pair in the Telegraph as well. Tell him to kiss my ass! - Tell all the letters. - Well, if I can design in the library, I tell him what you got a free ad. - Tell him he can kiss my ass real Irish whenever you want! - Hello, Leopold! - Chelsea Breen, how are you? I can not complain. How are you going to Molly? Alright! And your lord and master? Oh, I do not even speak! He is a danger to rattlesnakes! - You know what I did last night? - What? It woke me in the middle of the night, saying that the ace of spades was climbing the stairs. - The ace of spades? Ah ... um ... Mina Purefoy already had the baby? I just call ask how you're going. She is on maternity Holles Street. - For three days she is ill. - Sorry about that! It's a complicated delivery, second nurse. - Poor thing! - Ah, there he is! I brought your lunch. Give my regards to Molly, right? I will give. Good morning, again! The Jewish thoughtful. He saw her eyes? Ah, Dedalus, are in danger! Get your shield! Father? Stand up straight, for the love of the Lord Jesus! - You got any money? - Where do I get the money? Nobody in Dublin lend me a dime. You got something. Here you are. See what you can do with it. I bet you got five. Give me more than that! My, you are like others, is not it? A group of cheeky unhappy since your poor mother died. Can not seek money elsewhere? I can. I looked across the gully O'Connell Street. I'll try this now. - You're funny. - Here, buy a bottle of milk, bread or something. Soon I go home. - There he is. - What is he buying? Leopoldo or The Bloom Is on the Rye. - He is crazy about books! - He is an educated man. He is not a common and ordinary person. There's something artistic in Bloom. Have you seen this book? Oh no. She would not like that. "All dollars that her husband had given her, were spent in the most expensive and wonderful dress shops. For him! For Raoul! His mouth is stuck in his a voluptuous and delicious kiss while his hands might feel its opulent curves under clothing. Is delayed he said hoarsely, looking at her suspiciously. The beautiful woman withdrew its wrapper, displaying their shoulders Queen and volume in the breasts. " Oh, no ... 'll take this. Ah, Sweets of Sin! This is very good! - Here it is! - Thanks! Oh, look there! "The time is closing!" Says one. "Good luck!" It should be exciting up there! - Stephen? - What are you doing here? I bought it in another cart for a penny. Is it good? Chardenal's French primer. Why did you buy it? To learn French? Take it! Is reasonable. Father not Mind bet on you. I imagine that all my books are gone. Some. We had no choice. Give us a touch, Poldy! "God, I'm dying for it!" I was happier before. He was 28 years. She was 23. Something changed after Rudy. I never liked that. We can not turn back time. How's the old heart, citizen? Better than ever! What is it, Garry? We're going to win? Let's see if we win such Gold Cup. I think not yet. Not until the fourth. - When you stop jogging. - Me too. Unlikely. How's Willy Murray lately? Let's drink to our friend, Dignam! Paddy Dignam? Dead? - What time is it? - 4 hours. I'm late! Listen, but I saw the 5 minutes ago. He is not more dead than you! Maybe. They managed bury it in the morning somehow. My God! Dignam! I could swear ... - That God is good? - I'll forgive him for that! Good God it takes the poor Dignam? Well, he is without their problems now. I say he is a villain bloody, taking the lives the poor Willy Dignam! - Paddy Dignam! - Be quiet! - Good morning, gentlemen! - Martin Cunningham passed through here? - No, want to drink with us and wait? Oh no sorry ... no thanks, can not drink any more. - But I'll take one of these cigars! - Pass it to one of those, please! Ah, thank you! - Are you afraid that he bite? - No. Bloom is afraid that he think your leg is a pole. - Are you sure you want nothing? - Ah, no thanks. Actually, I just need to talk with Martin Cunningham on insurance of poor Dignam. He asked me to to their home. - Are you going there? - Yes. - You say to Ms. Dignam, I'm sorry for the loss and the funeral. Also, everyone who knew him are sad, having never known someone as good and true Willy and the poor deceased, and tell her ... - Yes, of course! With pleasure! I heard that Boylan is producing a concert now, in the north! - Is not she? - Who? Ah, yes. It's true. A summer tour, you know? - As an event. Mrs. Bloom is the star principal, is not it? My wife will sing, yes. I believe it will be a success. He is great at organizing, excellent! Lenehan, you look like someone who lost a bob and found a tanner. The race of the Gold Cup. Throwaway won. A stinky outside, 20-1. And the rest nowhere. Nice win! 20-1! Such is life in a cottage. Throwaway! Weakness, His name is Sceptre. Persecution! The story is full of it! - Perpetuating hatred among nations. - You know what is a nation? - Yes. - What is it? A nation? Nation is a group of people equal, living in the same place. - If so I'm a nation they live in the same place for 5 years. Or again, living in different places. - This is my case! - What is your nation, if I may ask? - Ireland! I was born here. Ireland! Pass us the drinks. What is that one? This is my, how the heck said the policeman dead. And I belong to a race which is also hated and persecuted. Right now, this instant, sold at auction in Morocco as slaves. You're talking The New Jerusalem? - I'm talking about injustice! - Okay, raise your flag and fight like men. This is not good. Strength, hate! This is not life for men and women! Insults and harassment. Everyone knows to be the opposite. - What is life? - What? I mean, the opposite of hatred. Well, I go to court Martin Cunningham to get here say that I come back in one minute. A new apostle to the Gentiles. Universal love. Well, that's not what we learned? To love our neighbors? That guy? Crave neighbors is their motto. - Love an ... - Well, Joe, to his good health and song. - More power, citizen! - That's right! The blessing of God, Mary and Patrick on you. - I know where he went. - Who? Bloom! In court, it's a lie! He bet on Throwaway and went to get some money! Bantam Lyons said Bloom made his bet this morning. He is the only man in Dublin who won. A black horse. He himself is a black horse. - Hello Joe, where is Bloom? - Defrauding widows and orphans. The new messiah of Ireland island of saints and sages. Well, they are still waiting for their redeemer. - And so do we! - Yes, and every man is born they believe might be the Messiah. And all Jews are extremely enthusiastic to discover whether they are the mother or father. Oh my God, needed to know Bloom deceased before his son was born. I found it one day at a market, buying kilos of food for baby, six weeks before of women giving birth. - You call this man? - I wonder if he got over it. - Well, his son was born, is not it? - And who he suspects? - Ah, love with the neighbor ... There you are! Just got off the court. - I was looking for you. - We are ready now. Ah, can rely on. You will see it is who owes money to him! - Enough is enough! Think he does not know, scared the hell? I got a Jew for you it was you who started it! - All are mouse droppings! - What? Do not tell anyone, is secret! - Let's Get Away - Leave me alone! Three cheers for Israel! Mendelssohn was a Jew and Karl Marx, Mercadante and Spinoza. The Savior was a Jew, and also his Father. Your God! He had no father!

He gave some suggestions, but I prefer to remain poor as I am! I was right! I gave her souvenirs, emerald alloys well above their position. I defended unconditionally when she was accused of theft. Now tell the truth! God is my witness I never touched anything! The offense continued? Something happened? He surprised me in the middle of facilities, Sir, when the lady was out doing shop the morning of a request the safety pin. He held me and abused me in four places as a result. And also shifted in my clothes! - She agreed! - I wanted to confront him, by God and it strengthened "Be quiet!" Order in court! The accused now make a false statement. Innocent! This is no place for levity indecent rather than a deadly sinner disguised by drinks beverages.

He sent me an anonymous letter. I still have it. He said he had seen My unique globes when I sat in a box Royal Opera House, and says that the deeply burned. He offered to send me by mail, a work of fiction Monsieur Paul de Kock, called Sweets of Sin. - Oh, me too! Yes even one person is wrong! He sent me several letters Handwritten, with exaggerated praise as "the Venus of kid." He praised my batty lower extremities, my swollen calf in silk stockings positioned on the edge, and praised my terribly hidden treasures invaluable income, which, he said, could conjure. He urged me to pollute the bed marriage, adultery, at the earliest opportunity. Me too! This plebeian Don Juan observed me pro behind a car and sent me obscene pictures, as those sold nights in Paris. An insult to any lady! They showed a naked lady, fragile and lovely, his wife, as he solemnly told me, taken by him of course, practicing illicit relations with a muscular torero, obviously a scoundrel! And he urged me to do the same, me behaving badly, sinning with soldiers of the troops. He implored me to soil his letter in a way that I dare not say, to punish him, as it truly deserves, to ride it and ride it, and give it a lash perverse! - Me too!

I was with the soldiers, and they let me do, you know, so a Young ran after me. But I'm faithful to the man who cares me, even being a prostitute. - Tell what happened right! - I was with the soldiers! Why not? The brave soldier! How then would if I broke his jaw? How? Too bad. Noble art of pretension, personally I detest action. Come on, professor, the car is waiting. What were you saying? Repeat! I understand your point of view.

I can take care of him, Sergeant! This can happen with anyone, right? - Sure you can, sir! - Boys are boys! I can take it home! C'mon! Hey, Mr Dedalus? Stephen? Who? The face reminds me his poor mother. Rudy? In return, they talked about music, literature, Ireland, Paris, friendship, women, prostitution, diet and the Roman Catholic Church. Bloom found common factors of similarity between their positive reactions and the negative experiences? Both were sensitive to art, music, Preferably of plastic and paint. Both demonstrated disbelief in many orthodox religions, in social doctrines, national and ethnic. That reaction was Bloom, arrival at your destination? On arrival at the 4th house, of equal squares, the number 7 Eccles Street, He automatically put his hand in the back pocket of his jeans, to get his key. - She was there? - I was in my pants pocket - She was there? - I was in my pants pocket corresponding to the pants used the previous day. - Why was angry again? - Because he forgot and then remembered he had remembered himself not to forget! What appears to the host, are the main qualities guest? Confidence in him. An equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation. As for humor? He did not dare, he did not expect, was not disappointed, he was satisfied. Pleased not to have sustained a positive loss, gain offered by having positive to others. Light to the Gentiles. What made his first verse original, written by him, a poet in potential with 11 years of age, on occasion where offered three prizes of 10, 5 and 2, shillings respectively, in a competition Shamrock, a weekly newspaper? An ambition oblique In my verse printed Makes me hope find that space? If you surrender, Please put in the end, The name of your sweetheart, L. Bloom. They spoke openly about their racial difference? None. What, if reduced its simple reciprocally, where thought to Bloom on the thought of Stephen on Bloom, and thought Stephen on thought Bloom about Stephen. He thought that he thought he was a Jew, although he knew he I knew he knew he was not. Why Bloom refused to say that had attended the university of life? Because its buoyant uncertainty on the observation had or had not been made by him to Stephen nor by Stephen to him. What two temperaments individually represent? The scientific, artistic. What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? Incomplete. With a void of contentment. Which domestic problem as it is, if not more than any other, often disruption to your mind? What to do with our wives. Stephen Bloom proposed that it pass the hours between today and tomorrow between the kitchen in the apartment and the dormitory for guests. Some advantages may appear the extension of this Agreement. For Stephen, home insurance and stability of education. For Bloom, rejuvenation intelligence, satisfaction of care. For Molly, the disintegration of obsession and acquisition of pronunciation Stephen perfect Italian. This proposed asylum was accepted? Gently inexplicably Kindly, thankfully, he refused. What confronted them when they, The first host, then the guest, emerged silently, in the dark and obscure passage row house to the shadows of the garden. The starry sky has long with fruit wet night. Both were silent. Silence, contemplating one another, the mirror of his flesh with each other, in his or his, friendly face. The trajectory of his first simultaneous action of urine, was uneven. The Bloom's was longer, less noisy, the Stephen was higher, more sibilant. Who in the last hours the previous day, argued for a consumption diuretic, an insistent pressure. Alone, which Bloom hear? The double reverberation of the foot, reborn on earth, double body vibration a Jew, the resonant surface. Alone, Bloom feels the cold stellar space, the subpoena incipient the approach of dawn. What imperfections a perfect day, Bloom, walking, silently truly sets? A fault condition, to renew an ad certify the presence or absence lower rectal orifice, in the case of deities Hellenic female. In response to questioning night of his wife, Bloom omits the information public trial in the neighborhood that with the permit Bernard Kiernan showed an erotic provocation, therefore, young lady; and reveals the reference volume pornographic and sinful: "Sweets of Sin." Bloom's acts. Wisely ... entering the lair of traps lust and snakes, clearly, to care less, respectfully, the bed conception and birth, consummation of marriage and the opening of marriage; sleeping and dying. What did its members, when gradually stretched to meet? - New linens, additional odors, the presence of the human form female, hers, printing the male human form, not his. Some crumbs, some pieces of meat, reheated, that he removed. What were the last thoughts, and that was the last occupant of the bed? Reflections on his force, commonly the body proportion, Bat, business skill, the best, amazingly, worthless. What event or person emerged as a salient point of his narration? Stephen Dedalus, teacher and author. During the course of this brief ascending and narration, the narrator and the listener are called to demonstrate the limits of compatibility marriage, where a complete carnal intercourse with ejaculation semen in the female organ, is not made 10 years ago, 5 months and 18 days. That was five weeks before Birth and death of his only son Rudolph Bloom Junior 11 days of life. A boy exhausted a child in the womb. Belly exhausted. He rests. He traveled, with Sinbad the Sailor Tinbad and the Tailor Jinbad and the Gaoler, Ninbad and the Preacher, Whinbad and the Whale, e. .. Yes because he has never done anything like this, how to order your coffee in bed with two eggs. Bring your coffee? Yes it came from somewhere, I'm sure by his appetite. Anyway, love is not, but would inappetent thinking about it. Is it any bitch or someone he got there. If they knew him as well as I ... someone who may find tenderness, because all men are thus well as boot all the money they can from it. The biggest idiots are old. And pulled my bag to disguise! Not that I care, but I wonder. As long as I do not have the two on my toes all the time like that bitch, Mary that we had, inflating your ass to excite him. A woman is not enough for them. I do not stoop about to spy on them. Yes, because he would not be so long without, should do so somewhere. Just to ruin a woman, no satisfaction, hoping to enjoy it and then having to end up alone anyway. This makes your lips turn pale. Anyway, is done once and for all. Everybody talks about it, but it is only the first time, after a situation is so common not more talk. Why can not kiss a man without having to marry him? First comes the feeling crazy and then get as good that can not be avoided. There's nothing like a long hot kiss, which almost paralyzes us. And I hate to admit me with Father Corrigan. He touched me, Father. Is there anything wrong with that? Where? And I told the channel. But where exactly you, my daughter? On the back of the leg. At the high end? Yes, Father, at discharge. That's where you sit? Yes My God, he could not say ass and just to clarify? What is the problem? And you ... I do not know what he said, I forgot. No, Father! And I always think the real father. What he wants to know, when I already confessed to God? I wonder: Did I know about the cabin? I could see his face, will he could see mine? Of course, I never would face. They're dying for a woman course. Would you be satisfied with me? Something I did not like was to have him hitting me behind when I was leaving, so intimate that I got to laugh. I am not a horse, or an ass, am I? Is he awake thinking or dreaming of me? We went to the port and clean fish I had a salty smell, yes, because I felt nice and tired and I fell asleep so I fell into bed. This crappy old bed shaking like a cab! I guess you can hear us across the street. So I suggested we put the quilt on the floor, with pillow under my butt. Terrible thunder scared me like those thunderstorms in Gibraltar. Terrible thunder scared me like those thunderstorms in Gibraltar. And they come and say that God does not exist and mockery if he heard this, because it never goes to church in masses or meetings. He says about the soul, we have no soul in us, only the gray matter. He does not know what is why not have one. Yes Because he has 3 or 4 times with that huge thing Gross and he has. Your nose is not so great! Later he took all my clothes with the blinds closed, hours after dressing myself, perfuming and combing me me as a steel or some kind of crowbar. Standing all the time! He must have eaten oysters, a dozen! He had a beautiful voice and I never found anyone in life with a size of those, that make you feel fully populated. What is the idea that we do this way, with a hole in the middle? They come as a stallion Up to you, because that's all they want. That bad look and determined. I needed to be with eyes half-closed, even then, he has that courage within yourself. I did take out and put me in considering how great, which is good if you have not been washed properly. Last time I let him finish me. What a beautiful invention made for women since they get all the pleasure. But if someone cares with others, could know through what I did with Rudy Mina Purefoy and what goes with her husband, who fills one with son or two a year, like clockwork. They are not satisfied while do not see us as a swollen elephant. What can be expected a man like that? I'd rather die than 20 times I married again with one of them. But of course he will not find never a woman who things with him like I do. I liked the way how she loved me, he knew how to pick a woman, 8 when he sent me flowers, But he could not embrace as well as Gardner. I looked a little bland, clear when he looked at me closely my makeup in the mirror. The mirror never passes the expression. In fact, lie on top of me that way, tapping its immense hip bone, it is heavy as well as having the hairy chest to warm up. Always having that lie to them. Even better if he caught me behind, the way Mrs. Mastiansky told me that her husband did, just like dogs do. Stretched the language as far as I could. You can understand a man the way he is? He looked like a devil by some minutes later he returned saying that the press was tearing the tickets and swearing at all because he said he had lost 20 pennies and lost even more to the outsider who won the race. So, would take me. Anyway, I want to make it at least 2 chemises or 3 for me. But I do not know what kind of prints he likes. Perhaps none. He did not say? Yes And half the girls in Gibraltar never wore one too! Naked as God made them! That Andalusian singing her Manola, did little secret with what she had. Yes What are these veins? I'm curious to know how should be done, 2nd equal in the case of twins. They should represent the beauty, put up there like statues in the museum. One pretends to hide with one hand. They are so beautiful. Compared with a man, Of course, with their two suitcases more floods and other thing hanging on it, or when it is standing on his forward as a hat rack. That's why hide leaves behind! The woman represents beauty, Of course, they admit. I wonder if they are not afraid to take a kick, or take a hit, or something! I ask that anyone keep that in mind! If I could remember at least half of things, I would write a book. The work of the Master Poldy. Be happy that these men take a woman. Feel your mouth. Oh, Lord, I need to stretch me! I wish he or someone were here to make me enjoy that way. Feel the fire inside me. Maybe if I could dream with the time he was the 2nd time running her fingers behind me and I enjoyed for nearly five minutes with my legs around him. I had to hug him afterward. Oh God I wanted to scream all kinds of stuff, erotic words, or something! But without looking ugly or with those lines. Who knows how to react? You want to feel good with a man! Not all are equal to him, thank God! Some want you feel so good about it. I notice the difference! There are those who do not speak! I gave my eyes that look, with her hair loose medium and my tongue between my lips, going for him, savage brute! Ah, well I could still find someone to give me what I want so much, that is to have something hard inside. We no longer have the same chances we had before! I would welcome someone a love letter. True or not, it brightens your day and your life! Always having something to think about, every moment, and witness to his back a new world! I could write a response in bed, walking, only a few words. I never imagined that this would be my name Bloom. Well, better than those Pinto with awful names. Ms. Anna Pinto or some other name with Pinto. The train again! Sound boring! Close your eyes and breathe my lips open. Kiss, sad eyes, eyes open, piano! I hate these big words! I'll make that clear from the next time you're in the spotlight. Kathleen Kearney and their squirrels. A bunch of puns Sparrow, arrogant, talking about politics. Understand it as well on my backside. I think she's submissive, for no man look at her twice. Gardner said no man could look at my mouth teeth and smiling without thinking about it. I was afraid that he might not like my accent. Everything my father left me. And my mother left eye and appearance in some way. He died for my lips! Women should find a husband to look good! And also one that excites money, those who can choose whoever you want, as Boylan, and still have sex 4 or 5 times stuck in each others arms. Or the voice too! I might even be a first lady but I married him! Looking down, with his chin down, but not much not to be twofold. Have they burning with envy! Anyway, I hope he does not meddle with drugs that cross the illusion he is young again burning through money and getting increasingly drunk. He can not drink water? I like to hear it up the stairs in the morning, with the cups beating tray. And then he started making their applications for eggs, toast and tea. I think there another man in the world with the habits like his. It's good that I do not kick, or you can pull out all my teeth! Wait! It is the Church of Georgia! That would be a good time for him to come home! First check your shirt. Let's see if he still have those French letters who used the pocket. He must think I do not know! Man a liar! All 20 pockets are not enough for their lies. And why should we expect? While it is true, they do not. Do not enter almost anything in their empty heads. They need to be taken slowly your own poison with their eggs and tea hot with butter and toast. He also is a terrible liar! No, he did not have the courage come out with a married woman! For her, Denis, as he calls it, got that look so unhappy, what harm could call him husband. Yes he's a bitch to him. He says it's author and will be university professor of Italian. I wanted to have some lessons. What does he plan now showing him my photo? I'm not good on her. Still, I look young. Does not he solved make me a present, yes, after all and why not? I was in mourning, doing 11 years. Yes he would have 11 years. While we need the grief, not good to go. He insisted to mourn the cat. I think now he is a man. He was an innocent boy and a dear little boy. He liked me too, I remember. Everyone likes. Wait, my God! Yes, wait Yes, one moment! He was on the cards in the morning, I played the deck. Union with young unknown, no beautiful or ugly you already know. I thought I could be him! But he is not a brat nor is unknown. They all write about women in his poetry, and it is unlikely to find many like me, smooth with visions of love and serenades, where poetry is in the air. Certainly he is very distinct, I'd like to meet a man with this, God, not as the wild I know. Moreover, he is young! A young guy who can find dipping rocks Margate Beach. Sunbathing, naked like gods or something, and then playing in the sea with them. Why do men are not all like that? Women have some consolation. Like that little statue he bought. Could look at it all day! It exists the real beauty and poetry! I always feel I want to kiss you all, including her adorable young cock, so simple. I would not mind put it in my mouth nobody's watching. It is as if he asked suck it for you! It looks so clean and clear with his boyish face. I would even in a split second, even something that came out of it, would like a porridge, or dew, there is no danger. He is so clean compared pigs with those men, I believe they never dreamed Washing in a range of 1 year. Can this be what gives mustaches on women. I just love it if I could get involved with a beautiful young poet at my age. I'll put the cards early in the morning and I will wait until the letter you want appears, or I'll read and study everything what you can learn and remember, if only I knew what he likes, he did not think I'm dumb and that all women are equal. I can teach you on another subject, I will make him feel all up he almost fainted on me. And then, he can write about his lover and mistress, publicly with all our photos the papers when he becomes famous. Ah, but then What would I do with it? Would not to be a husband, but you can not deceive a lover! No, it would be! He has no manners, is not refined or anything of that nature, slapping on my ass that way, because they called him Hugh. The ignorant do not recognize poetry as money. This is what happens not to keep it in place! He rips the pants and shoes and puts the chair before me, with face-to-toe, without even asking permission and still maintains this vulgar way with his shirt half open, that use to be admired. Of course he is right, with his way of passing time playing, which is much better than being in bed with what, a lion? God, I think he has something better to say. A lion would have! Oh, I think it's because they are so plump and tempting inside my jacket, he could not resist! They excite me, sometimes. Men enjoy the pleasure they feel when seeing the body of a woman. We are so round and clear for them. Sometimes I wish I had one from me for a change to try to use that thing they have and stick it in me, so hard, and at the same time, so soft when you touch. Men, again! They can pick and choose whoever they want. A married woman, a grieving widow or a girl all with different flavors. We're doomed living chains, but they will not chain me right! When I start, I tell you, that because of our husbands stupid, we can not remain friends instead starting a fight? Why we were given all that desire? Not my fault if I am young, I? It's a wonder I can not be an old hag at my age! Living with him so coldly, you just hold me sometimes when sleeping. My order wrong, he does not know who he is! Any man who would kiss the ground the woman steps, I deserve to throw my hat! Thereafter, he can kiss whatever you want. But we have not even an atom of expression in us! We are all one piece lard, but I would not that with a man! Gross dirty! I do not want to think anymore! I kissed his foot, se?orita! This is a man that nobody understands, except me! Still, it is obvious that a woman likes being embraced 20 times a day. That makes her feel young! No matter by whom, but what matters is being in love with someone. If the person you want is not there ... sometimes, God, I thought about leaving by night where nobody knows me, and pick up a sailor from the sea, deranged, not caring who I was, but only for make love without thinking about anything. It could be also one of those gypsies traveling there. One of these subjects with beautiful eyes and face boor, attacking me in the dark against the wall, without saying a word. Or a murderer, anyone! It is a pity that the sailors are rotting with disease! Ah, take this huge walk away, for God's sake! Listen! The winds that blow my pities away, so that it can sleep and regret, the great tipster Don Poldy La Flora, and I must drag myself to the kitchen to prepare your coffee authority, while it is rolled as a mom. I will do the same, have you seen me run? I'd like to see me! Demonstrate attention and treat her like dirt! I do not care what others say, but it would be much better for the world if women were ruling, because we would not see women killing and slaughtering each other. Well, is a sad case to those they have a beautiful son, like that and are not happy. I'm not! He failed to make one? Not my fault! We were happy together as I saw the two dogs doing it that way, in the middle of the deserted street. This left me completely heartbroken! I think I should not have it buried with that jacket I knitted woolly, I was like crying! It should have given some poor child. But I knew well, I would never have another. It was our first death too! Never been the same. Oh, I will not start to come into depression, talking about it again! I wanted to understand why he spent the night here ruining your life forever maybe. Still, would be great! So quiet! Wanted to tell him many nonsense, serving it well, thought to be his fault the fact that I was an adulteress. Oh, big deal if this is all evil we did in this valley of tears. God knows it is nothing! Everyone does, but they hide. I think a woman is good for this, He not only would have made us this way, so attractive to men. They often say God does not exist. I'd give anything what they learn.
