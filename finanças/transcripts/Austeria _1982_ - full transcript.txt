The Film Studio "KADR" presents a film by based on a novel by AUSTERIA Screenplay Starring Production Management Director of Photography Directed by 1914 - the first day of war Don't get off! We're not staying! Welcome, Mr. Tag. Where is the Jew going and what is he taking? One or two Jews, that I get. But so many? Why are you laughing like a fool? Dad, we can't stay here. We don't have time. Maybe he needs something before we go? We won't have anywhere to stop in this heat. Come closer. All right, all right. Quickly! What's going on? Why are you getting off? - I'm thirsty. - Don't get off! Quickly! Drink, wash and we're off! Give him milk. - We'll get off only for a minute... - Don't get off! God forbid! Come sonny, come. Time to eat. You've eaten? You've drunk? We're off. Everyone ready? May he grow in good health. Asta! It's your birthday. Look, those tyrants are my parents! They oppose our marriage because you're poor. But I love you madly and always will. Alfred! My Alfred! Death is our only choice! God! How terrible! How miserable I am! Today, we die together. We'll drink that poison. Me first! No! Me. I beg you, give it to me. No, I'll go first. Drink it! Let my mother find our bodies when it's too late... Too late... Too late... Alfred, the poison is burning my insides. Stay brave till the end. God, why did I let you take your life? It's too late for me but you save yourself! I feel the kiss of death on my lips. I love you, my gallant knight. I beg you, save yourself. Save yourself! I love you! What's this?! Stop it! Mothers brought children here! It's a scandal! I cannot watch this! Children, we're going home. Curtain! Quiet, please! Nothing's happened. Quiet please. As the director of this play... I'm exhausted. And my feet are sore. I told you new shoes weren't a good idea. How far can you walk in a day? What's the purpose of this wandering? Has anyone heard of it before? It's never been heard of before. In a real war the two armies go to battle. They chose a place, far from town. They stand vis a vis, with cannons, ammunition, infantry, with horses and music and so forth... The generals on their horses are on the hill. The enemies' left flank is countered with the right. And the other way round. But to take over the town without even knocking? - It's bad manners! - Why the surprise? Whoever starts a war wants to win it immediately. Our emperor is no different. But I know nothing about flanks. I'm no general. It's immaterial, Mr. Apfelbaum! Apfelgrun. My apologies, Mr. Apfelgrun. The enemy is in a hurry, that's true. But why is the tsar in a hurry? Because he has to be! When one's in a hurry it means one has to be. What are we waiting for? Either we go back home, or we move on! I'm fed up with all these speeches! Mum is right. Let's go. Stay out of this. We'll be going shortly. Asia, let's go. - What was I saying? - Mom, why do we have to go? I know. I was talking about ammunition. Do Russians have enough ammunition? My sources claim that this war won't be fought with bullets but with bayonets. Ammunition... bayonets... What's really important is that the enemy is in a hurry. And when that happens... We've escaped from the pogrom once already. Like we are escaping now. But this is Austria, not Kishinev. And pogroms won't happen here under the emperor's reign. Every Jew wishes him a long and healthy life. Pity he's not a Jew. Though probably he would never admit it. His Jewish heart is enough. A Jewish heart! What do I care about the emperor? God support, God protect the emperor... Spoken like a man with no views and no access to papers. One can never tell who has more views. One should have a minimum of class. A man should be a man. It's not that stupid, Mr. Gershon. My words exactly. Humanity above all! And unity. As the proverb says: united we stand, divided we fall. Right you are, Mr. Socialist. War cannot be won without unity. The Jerusalem Temple was destroyed because they had none... - I didn't start this... - We need unity to win the war. And we must win, not for the emperor but for ourselves. Let's clean up the mugs. They will be here soon. They? What are you talking about? The Cossacks! They'll take everything! She's right. We must go. Dad, we must remember that Lolka is 13. Grandpa, let's go. Like everyone else. You know Grandpa. Come, at least get changed. The Cossacks are already in the woods. They'll be here any minute. Why aren't you running away Tag? Where to, Baroness? Get in. Quickly. If a man is not safe in his own bed, where can he be? Among strangers? That's no time for philosophy. They'll be here any minute. Yevdoha, go to the barn. You old devil! They wander and they flee. It won't end soon. When will it end? This is why you chose us, God? Thank you. If Abraham hadn't begun his wanderings, we'd have saved quite a few kilometers over the years. How many volumes has history filled? Six? Seven? What now? What now? You'll hide in the cellar. We won't be hiding anywhere. Why? They'll want vodka and they'll find the cellar. Mom is right. The first night is the worst. I'll hide you in the cellar. And won't let them anywhere near. Where are the women? Escaped. Why? I'm wondering myself. Because they're stupid! Stupid! That is all we ever hear. What a time for a migraine. Lolka, my drops. No, wait, I'll get them. What's going on? Come to the kitchen. I'll close the trap-door and cover it. They're here. - Come, for the love of God... - They're here. Open door! Open window! Now! German without the articles? They pretend to be our boys. Don't open the window! No fear! Cossacks? Are you Cossacks? No, Hungarian. Open. My God, it's our troops! Grandpa, Open up! You should have told us so at once. Come in! Come. Where are the Russians? You haven't found them? We lost our regiment. Understand or not understand? Understand! Oh, how I understand. They lost their regiment. Hussars with horses and cannons... How is it possible? It just is. It's war. It isn't the officer's fault. My apologies, don't be angry. Angry? What a nice start to the war! How many more regiments will the emperor lose? Away from the window! Istvan! Cossacks! Well, Mr. Honved? We've already won the war. You are standing here, as if you have fired a shot. Let's light the lamp. Lolka, get me the shall from the hook. It's Yevdokha's. Never mind. At night, light draws people in. We'll pretend we're not here. When a fool closes his eyes, he thinks he's invisible. Sit down, Mr. Honved. My God, you know the hidden secrets of the world. And of everything that is alive. My God... What's your name? Yevdokha. Where are you from? The village. What do you do? I graze cows. Will you be my servant? I will. Open up! Open up! She's alive! Let's put her down. Let me help. - My God, where shall we put her? - In my room. My God. Maybe you can help? Asia... Asia... - Where is your father? - She's alive... - She should be in the hospital. - The hospital is completely abandoned. Where's Wilf, the photographer? Bum, where is your father? Leave us! God gives and God takes away. Blessed be the Just Judge. Bum, for fear of God, what are you doing?! She's alive! He's laughing? Go now. Go. We must do something. We can't leave her here. Get a sheet and another candlestick. Lolka, fetch some straw. We have to wait out the night. All night! God, I can't take it. For the sin committed openly or secretly, for the sin of my debauchery, for the sin of my false confession... For the sin committed in speech and in writing. It's going to kill me! Where is my Asia?! My only daughter. The family's crown. Her father's pride. Watch out! I can barely stand. It's all the boy's fault. I kept telling her: Asia stay with us. But he was always around and look what happened... Blanka, come, sit down. Leave this. Leave? Can't you see him lying by your daughter? A Jew would never lie like this. Not even by his wife. My God, you understand nothing. Get me a bowl of cold water. It's a miracle I'm still alive with such feet. There is water in the kitchen. And a bowl too. I'm innocent. Please stay, Mr. Wilf! Bum, lad, you'll help us. We will take her and put her on the floor. Bum, can you hear me? Get up, it'll give you strength. Spread the straw by the wall. Carefully. We'll put her with her feet towards the door. She's not here anymore. What are you staring at? Thank him for what he's doing for me! Danke. Blanka, we must take Asia home. What for? Why carry her back and forth? And who will? You? By yourself? Do you have enough strength? I will hire a cart. Is this why I fled the Cossacks? To run into them at night, already on a cart? He has no idea what they're capable of. A whole regiment catches one poor girl... Do you know what they do!?! You can go alone if you want to. I'm staying here. Blanka, it's unseemly. What is? I don't understand. What will people say? And is a doctor not a man? What's the difference? A doctor is better? Am I right, officer? Yes! Is old Tag here? A hussar... Why are you silent? Was the hussar here? No. No one was here. What? You old devil. Asia. Bum, please, don't! Don't be afraid! No, please, leave me! Not here. So where? Only trees are around. Stop it. Someone may hear you. Let them hear! Let them see! I don't care! I don't care about your stepmother and my mother... Don't talk like this, or I'll take offense. Bum, they're shooting! Asia! Don't run! Don't run! Asia! Don't run! Bum! My son! You have a fever. You hear me? You have a headache? Tell me! Get up! Let me be! I won't. You're not a baby anymore. Her parents are gone. What will people say? What a stench! I'm leaving. You can't spend the night here. That's the way to mourn a wife. Go away! You wouldn't mourn a relative like that. What do you want from me!? How dare you talk to your mother like that?! I know! I know! You're happy now! I hate you! My God, he went mad! Get out! At your own mother?! - Oh God! - At your own mother?! You. ...! What happened, Sabina? What's wrong with you? Bum, what's going on? What's all that shouting? Must everything fall apart on the first day of war? What's all this! - Nothing really happened. - It's still not enough for him. What happened, father? Have some respect for the sanctity of death! Leave. We must call the Virgin's father. According to the Jewish custom, someone must keep vigil by the body. - What kind of a father is he? - He should hold a wake. - Where is Wilf, the photographer? - Why isn't he here? He is the father! Hush! Just one death and you've already grown used to it? Mr. Kramer, take your wife. Let her calm down. He is right! Yes, you're right. Come, Sabina. Bum! Leave Bum be. I want to tell him something. I'm his father. Mr. Kramer, the father, the mother? What does it mean? Father, mother - they mean nothing. One goes through life without them and they appear when they're least needed. Oh, Bum! How I wish it was tomorrow already. Do you think I believe in God? I find it more and more difficult. And the more difficult I find it, the more I'm afraid of Him. But if you at least can doubt in God, then it's good. Nothing comes from itself. There must be a man and a woman. There must be a sin! And that's why one must believe! Or not so much believe, as doubt in God. And that's why I don't know what is a sin and what isn't... Do you understand, Bum? We must make a death robe for Asia. What do the Cossacks' horses look like? What do they look like? What a question? A horse is a horse, it always looks the same. You're such a wise man, Mr. Pritsch. It takes a minimum of class, Mr. Apfelgrun. What is it? Two more carts. - Just what we needed. The Hasidim? - Yes. With wives and children? A disaster! Would you rather welcome the Cossacks? The night isn't over yet. Open the gate and lock it up after them. Now it's like Noah's Ark. Do you know the story of the pig on Noah's Ark? You probably know it better. It's a remarkably funny story. So the pig... Everybody talks about himself... Did you want to say something Mr. Pritsch? - I didn't want to. I did! - What did you say? Repeat it! Dear Jews! Pretty Jews! The tzaddik himself has arrived. Welcome him with respect due to such a holy Jew. Blessed be the visitor... Blessed be... Blessed! Blessed! What do I care? Mr. Kramer. But naturally... Why not... Such a visitor. Blessed be the visitor. Right away! The tzaddik wishes to wash his hands. Water! Water! Leave them to me. I'll lead them out. Follow me, you flock of his holiness. You'll be comfortable there. From the depths I summoned you, God. My Lord, hear my song. May you lend your ear to my begging. If you remember the sins, God, who will be left? You are the absolution, so Thou may be feared... I am waiting for God. My soul is awaiting him. I am awaiting His Word. My soul is awaiting the Lord. More than the sentinels await the dawn. May Israel await God, for in God is mercy and great absolution. He shall absolve Israel of all its sins. Somehow it feels unbecoming. I've already prayed. But one can at least stand up. No need to offend others. - Twenty-four, twenty... - Mom has never been so ill. You're stupid! She's right. You can't keep calling her stupid. Lolka, bring me water. Blanka! Blanka! She's not here? She said she was going upstairs. She came in for a minute but refused to lie down. - She just waited for Mr. Wilf to leave. - He's already looked for her here. I need to fetch some straw to the kitchen. I'll be back. Straw? What for? My God, what will this house look like? It's Friday. How will I get everything ready for tomorrow? Yevdokha! You're awake? Where is the ladder? Over there. Please lower the lamp. It dazzles me. Better? Thank you. And thank God you came. Thank God someone did. Now tell him. - Tell whom? - Him. Please, tell him. Oh, yes. Mr. Wilf, the tzaddik said: "Find the father of the killed virgin for she might become the absolution of lsrael." His daughter was killed by Cossacks. She is dead and he's delusional. It's a shame! It takes a bad father to think of such things at such a moment. Blanka... Blanka, what? And the hussar? Don't come near me. What about the hussar? I don't even speak his language. Please tell him, that as of today I am no longer Blanka to him. We're done. - Blanka, how can you? - How can I? I can't live like that anymore. Don't look here, don't look there! When did I say that? You've reached an agreement? Thank God. There was a hussar, now there isn't. If Cossacks found him here, he would go unscathed but I would get hanged. Can they catch him? You heard they wouldn't harm him. Take the straw to the kitchen. I'll be right there. Yevdokha! - Where have you been? - None of your business. You... Let go, you old devil! Go to bed and stay there. I'm not sleepy. If I catch you with the hussar, I'll kill you both. Old devil! I shall love God, who is my strength. God is my rock. God is my fortress. I shall trust Him. From the depths I summon You, God. From the depths I summon You, God. Lord! Hear my voice. Lord! Hear my voice. Enough! I don't know about the others, but I'm not a psalmodic Jew. I'm not made for manual work. Not all of us here are water carriers. We have our own songs. That's true. We do. Sing! Sing! A psalm is a psalm, but now you sing! Sing, singer, with an echo... The tzaddik tells you to sing. The tzaddik tells you to make merry. Where God lives, who knows? Where God lives, I know. Where is the open door? Where God lives? Who knows? Where the door is open I know. Where is the house where God lives? Where is the open door... Where is the house...! My dear! My beloved! My beautiful Jews! Today may only be compared to the day, when the temple was destroyed! Can one sing on a day like this? One must not. This is a day of mourning. I told you, I warned you, that she was laying in this house! What did the Jew say? When, where? I told you. When will the undertakers arrive? Ah me! Look at me! Who is lying? Where? The girl who was killed. Look at me! At me! Let him talk. What happened? I can't hear anything. Behold a sinner! Look at me! I'm standing here and I sin! I'm speaking and I sin. I'm up to my neck in sin. Yes, the danger of death is pacing the street. I also come from priestly line. So am I. And I mustn't be under one roof with a corpse. The threat of death erases the sin. Why didn't I go with my son? Rebbe, I will go home. May I? What did he say? Rebbe, bless my journey and I'll go. The great holy tzaddik allowed us to stay here. I'm going back with you. I have no business here. I have no wife nor daughter. What can Cossacks do to me? Rebbe, give me your blessing, so that I may safely return home. Wait a minute, Mr. Jew. What does it mean, return home? What happened to the world? You don't care that tzaddik will have to walk? The tzaddik already gave me his hand. Only two fingers! And you talk to me. He's sitting here but he's floating above, catching angels. He's not the one to decide whether the baker goes home. The danger of death paces the streets and you're unhappy? Sit here and don't move! You want to bring misfortune on your wife and children? And that's the end of it! I understand none of it. He owns a cart and a horse and cannot go where he pleases? We finally agree. His cart, his right. If he wants to go, let him. Everyone has the right. But he doesn't know what may happen on the way. Hush! The tzaddik is coming back to us. He's back. Bread. Now, now... And you draw bread from the ground... Amen! Where God lives, who knows? Where God lives, I know. Where is the open door? Where does God live? Is this appropriate? Think, my dears! I've already told you that she is laying in this house. And you want to dance? Any moment may be the last. - The end of the world? - Yes! The end of the world! So we will hear the Messiah's horn. I already hear his steps. Dancing lifts you three feet off the ground. And the Messiah is in the song. What do you know, inn-keeper, about the Messiah? I'll tell you. I'll tell you about the Messiah. This is the story of the holy Besht. As he was about to bring the Messiah, he called upon him: Messiah! Messiah! Messiah! I command you to come, just like our holy forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses! Come and see, Messiah, how my Jews suffer. I, Beszt, son of Eleazar can no longer watch the suffering of my people. And a great storm started and great darkness came. And in the midst of it there was a brief moment of silence, in which the Messiah was about to appear, to put an end to our cares, diseases, death, and then, woe betide us, Besht's favorite disciple laughed out loud. It was the Satan in Haman's ears who wanted to hang all the Jews. May he die in such a way that none of his bones is ever found. Amen. Amen! Will the tzaddik allow? Tzaddik won't mind? What do you want to say? Don't be angry with me! Go on, speak. Merriment and rejoicing! Moses will read the Torah to us! Aaron will sing, while Miriam will dance... And that means... That means... It means that you're already dreaming about that woman. Naked harlot! Try not to choke! Out, you hussy! Out! She's gone? The priest has arrived. He's waiting. I'm older than you. Only two years. But older. Tag, wait! Ego te baptiso in nomine Patri... No, no, you mustn't. What's going on here, Tag? A murdered girl is lying here. Your weepers are screaming? We don't employ weepers. So who is there? Better just ask who isn't, father. Noah's Ark. Nicely put. The worst thing is that there are women and children there. What am I to do with them? Do they have to scream like this? There are very strong believers who shout to fend off their own thoughts. Quite a moment they've picked for exorcisms. Yes. Yes? Yes what? The innocent may suffer because of those fools. You think they aren't innocent? Don't split hairs. I'm older and I deserve respect. Only two years older. And yet, you always seemed younger. Even today. I've come to take you and your family. The Cossacks may be here any minute now. What about them? Them? Those little children. They won't harm the children. And the women? I can only take your family. How can I leave people in my home? With us, it's sanctity. What if one of them is Elijah, the prophet? The prophet will be fine. Don't worry. A dead virgin is lying in my room. She must be purified and shrouded in a death robe. They are singing again. I'll be right back. Or maybe you are in a hurry? I can't wait long. Gershon, help! H OW? I wish I knew. Name? Josele, say his name. Rebbe, I didn't give you a bill. Tell them to stop. The Cossacks may be here at any moment. What's going on? Josele, Josele! Can't I leave the tzaddik alone for a moment? Is he a man of iron? You must talk to him through me. For God's sake! Make them stop. How can you? On a night like this! Why is tonight different from all other nights of the year? Rebbe, tell them to stop. What do you want, my son? Rebbe, good, dear Rebbe! Tell them to stop. It's the peril of death, peril to the soul! Write it down! Rebbe, death is in my house. She is lying in my house. She'll recover. Stop! What are you thinking? Do you want to bring misfortune on you and on my home? Life! Life! Again the harlot with bare ass? No. Tell us what you see! Tell us everything! Enough. That's enough! Stop it! Hush! Have no fear. - What happened? - Rebbe saw a large cloud! We were so close... Look at him! An evil spirit won't leave him in peace. Meat! Feed him pork like some goy. From a pig's ass! Listen Israel! Our Lord is the only God! It's through the likes of you anyone can get to us. He is possessed by an obsession... Look Jews, what I eat! My son, don't you realize what you're holding? I don't? I do. Perfectly well. This is a chunk of pork. Then you don't know that it is the fast-day. Why shouldn't I know? I know perfectly well. Today is the Day of Judgement! Then you certainly don't know that on the Day of Judgement God writes down in the Book of Life who will live until the next Day of Judgement and who won't. Why shouldn't I know? I know perfectly well but I just don't give a damn! Son, maybe you're only pretending you're holding a pig. I am not. This is a chunk of pig's meat. And if you want, I can eat it right now. God! Look at your people! Even the worst refuse to offend you with a lie. God! Look at this man who refused to offend you on the Day of Judgement. I wanted to offend God, for I was angry with Him. But now I see how stupid I was. If I failed to offend the Rabbi, then how I can irritate God? What are you doing? Have you gone mad, boy? Help me, Father. I'll manage after that. Crazy boy. God! Have you seen old Tag? No. Where can he be? I don't know. Have you seen my husband? He suddenly stopped following me. Old Tag. Is he there? Is anyone there? Let me in. I won't. Please, let me in. I won't. Why? I just won't. I must go in there! There is no one in the meadow, apart from your husband. Tell her to let me in. Let her in, Yevdokha. I will not. What can we do? Let's go. I will not fight her. I was looking for you in the meadow. Where were you? Nowhere. Barefoot on wet grass? You'll catch a cold. Go get some sleep. I don't want to sleep. Leave me alone. Fire. Was Bum here? I don't know. Is he there? No. Come down! Quickly! The town is on fire! Come. Fire. A Jew is coming. I can't find Bum anywhere. What do you mean? I ran to tell him about the fire but he wasn't there. The town is on fire and that crazy boy is gone! I dreamt of dreadful things, may they befall my enemies. One's own thoughts are one's greatest enemy. - The whole town is in flames! - Open the gate! The view is better from the road. Wait! Gentlemen! Where is that? What street? - The town square! - Why the town square? I think it's near the church. My wine store! My apartment! Who's coming with me? I'm going back to town! I am. I'm not. Maybe there is still time. There's no time. We must go. No, I'm not going back. Wait! I'm coming with you! If everybody is going, so am I. Go, Mr. Wohl. - We'll take Pritsch. - All right. Mr. Pritsch! Where is my husband? Oh God. Mum! Where is my child? Oh God! Mum! Grandpa, Grandpa! What should we do? Go back to bed. Papa, I saw the fire! Can they come here too? Fire. Fire. Let it burn! Let it all burn down. Blanka! Blanka! We must wake them up. What for? The quieter the better. But the town's on fire. And how can they help? There is a prayer for everything, the thunder and the rainbow, but not the fire. "The maker of fire lights..." ...only that one... All you can think of is singing... Cantor, the son of Cantor. "The maker of fire lights..." Bum, we won't get to the cemetery through here. I'll go alone, Father. Leave her! For heaven's sake, we're taking her to the cemetery. People! Jesus! And he said to Esther... our adversary and enemy, Haman... "Here is the tree which Haman prepared for Mordekhai". Haman ended up on the gallows he had prepared for Mordekhai! A Jew does not kill, just like the fish cannot fly or the bird cannot swim. Jewishness rests on learning like on a column, like on a single leg. Love thy neighbor as thou lovest thyself! This is our whole wisdom. Anybody can learn it by standing on one leg. Our enemies still judge us falsely. Hamans always surround us... ...just like wolves surround helpless sheep. And what can a helpless man have against Haman? Only his pure heart. As I'm standing now before the tree of death, I have only my pure heart. Haman! I give you pearls for the boy's life! Hush, little darling, I'll tell you a story. When you grow up you'll be a Jew. You'll trade in almonds and raisins. Yevdokha, are you asleep? What? What's wrong? I'm afraid... What's the matter with you, devil? I am old, Yevdokha. Don't be afraid, you old devil. They want to hang Bum. I knew it would end like this. I've done all I could. I begged the commandant. But Bum didn't kill her. Why did I help him? The older one gets, the more stupid one becomes. I must go to the commandant. What for? To tell him that he wants to hang an innocent man. You can't help. This how it all ends. Not only for me. I have to go... You're so stubborn. What else did you expect, Father? lam a Jew and I will remain a Jew. You're different. All Jews are alike and I'm no different. On whose behalf shall we speak? I don't know. Who sent us? I'm going alone. First, you'll come to the church. I will hear your confession. A Jewish confession is a prayer before dying. I've already said it. I won't let you go. We're going together. No, I know you will go alone. I'll be back before long. You're lying! Be good for Nina and Lolka. They'll take everything. Let me go. Then go, you old devil! The keys are in the drawer. The money is in the wallet. Give everything to Nina. Be good to her. They will kill you there! You old devil! Old devil! Easy! Why the haste? Where's the fire? Why did they wake him? The tzaddik must have nerves of steel to stand it. He is barely alive! Who woke him? What difference does it make? I woke him, he did, everyone did. What for? This question doesn't make sense. The town is on fire! So what? There is a prayer and there is a blessing for everything. Stay away! I would like to know. ls the fire far or near? And if it's near, and let's say it is, although it isn't, then what? Is this reason enough to wake the tzaddik? Is he a fireman? Now, now, now... God bless you. Long life! The time comes for the morning calling of the Name. What a great God we have. This day won't be worse than yesterday. Amen. Hush! The tzaddik will say something. God willing, we will be worthy to hear his voice. It's delightful to be a Jew. Delightful! At the beginning God created Heaven and Earth... and then the Lord said: let there be light. Light. And God saw the light. And evening turned into dawn. The first day. Praise the Lord with your horns and songs! He led us from sorrow towards joy. From darkness towards the light. The weeping will rise in the night. The joy will return in the morning. The sin will rise in the night. The absolution will return in the morning. The voice will rise in the night. It will be heard in the morning. Fear will rise in the night. Trust will return in the morning. Death will rise in the night. Resurrection will return at dawn. Let's go and bathe in the water. Cast of characters Music by
