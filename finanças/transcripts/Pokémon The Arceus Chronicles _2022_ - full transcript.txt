The exciting, wonderful world of Pokémon! A group of most unusual creatures, teeming with mystery! While some can be found in the sky, some live in the water, and some live in the grasslands. Wild Pokémon are everywhere! Amid such an abundance of life, there is one Pokémon in this world who existed before all others… Arceus! And to this day, Arceus is watching over Pokémon and people alike. Ash and Goh are investigating the legends surrounding Arceus, so they traveled to Canalave City in Sinnoh. They're here in their role as research fellows to investigate the way the people of Sinnoh lived in the distant past. I hear this is a re-creation of how the city looked long ago. It's like we're in a movie! This place looks totally awesome! Pika, pika! Ash! Goh! Wow, it's Dawn! Pikachu! Great to see you here! Aw, you should've told me you were coming! You surprised me! Well, you surprised the two of us. - Right? - Yeah! Piplup! Uh, Dawn? What are those clothes? Pretty cool, huh? I just borrowed them. Awesome stuff! Pikachu! Why don't you two borrow some clothes? - I'm sure you'll look great! - Good idea! Then we should have our picture taken! - Sure! Follow me! - Right! Guys, over here! Pika! You can borrow whatever you like! Hello? Hey, it's Ash and Goh. Nice to see you! Cynthia! Pika! See, Cynthia has been really helpful throughout the entire Sinnoh Festival! Are you here on an investigation? Yeah! This historical exhibit should be quite helpful! Have a good look around! Thanks! Hey, Cynthia? So Ash and Goh want to borrow clothes. Perfect! What do you think, buddy? - Pika! - This is so great! Grookey-groo! - You both look amazing! - Piplup! Then you're all set! Now, allow me to be your guide! Toxicroak. Get it! Now, use Dig! Toxic! Toxic! G1 to G2. Capture complete. This is G2. Copy that. Return to base. That's Mount Coronet, isn't it? Yes. With its brutal environment, it is thought to have had a large impact on everything in the area, including Pokémon. Take a look at this image. That's a Growlithe, and that's a Braviary. And it's said that the other two are the evolved forms of Basculin and Stantler. Wow… Pika, pika! Pika! Pi, pi! Pika! I wonder if they still exist. I wish I could catch all of them! Cynthia? Just how exactly did people catch Pokémon back in those days? Great question. I'm glad you asked. Here. - These are Poké Balls? - Pika? - Check it out, Pikachu. - Pikachu. But they're a little different. So they were made of wood… Grookey? That is the kind of Poké Ball they used a long, long time ago. Yeah? - Pika? - Grookey? Piplup! We recreated them using designs left by the artisans of the time. Those old designs survived? And you can catch Pokémon with those? - Of course. - I wanna try! - Yeah, me too! - I do too! I thought you'd say that! So allow me to be your guide as you all experience… The Pokémon catching game! This reminds me of Cerise Park! Can I try to catch them? Not just yet. Now, everybody come out! O-oshawott! - Cyndaquilt! - Rowlet! - Pika? - Grookey! Piplup! It's Oshawott, Cyndaquil, and Rowlet! Pika, pika! Cyndaquil is from Johto. Oshawott is from Unova. And isn't Rowlet from Alola? Cynthia, what's this all about? It's written in the historical record that these three kinds of Pokémon were brought from other regions to Sinnoh! That's amazing! I wanted to see what influence these three Pokémon from other regions would have on the environment. So I asked them to help me out. - Really? - Pika, pika! Right! And so, you'll be catching three Pokémon. You can say hello to the three of them right now! - Oshawott! - Quil! We're gonna be good friends! Pikachu! Only one Poké Ball per person. And you only have three minutes to do the catching! Catch one and you'll get a valuable prize! Three minutes will be more than enough! - It's a competition! - Count me in! And the winner gets all of the prizes! It's a deal! Of course, your Pokémon partners can all help. Okay. Now, it's off into the thickets, you three! It's just like hide and seek! Piplup! It's time to get ready, Ash, Goh, Dawn… Let's… go! - Ready for this, Pikachu? - Pika! Get ready to take first place, Grookey! Grookey! 'Kay, Piplup! We're gonna win this thing! - Pika? - I guess it's just a Kricketot… Pikachu. Grookey. You see one? Aw, it's a Cherrim… Pikachu. Where are you? Come on out! Quick, Piplup, use Drill Peck! Wait, it can do that? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Piplup, now's my chance! What's this? - Rowlet! - Hey, Ash! Over here! Okay. Piplup, we'll catch Oshawott this time! Hold up! I said wait! If that's the case, then I'm catching Cyndaquil! Cyndaquil! Grookey. I'm good. Cynda… quil! You know, you're pretty bold, aren't you? Grookey, great work! Go! Pika! Let's wrap this up, Piplup! Poké Ball, let's go! Osha! - Caught 'em! - Did you see that smoke? So these are old fashioned Poké Balls… Interesting, aren't they? Yeah! - A Rowlet! - A Cyndaquil too! And Oshawott! We caught all of them! All right, everybody bring out those Pokémon! - Oshawott. - Cyndaquil. Thanks so much, you guys! Pika, pikachu. Yeah! A great Pokémon catching game! What was that for? You see, Cyndaquil uses Flamethrower on someone when it likes them. When did they become such good friends? Since you all caught your Pokémon within the time limit, here are the prizes I told you about. - Man, I'm psyched! - And the game was a three way tie! No one can hoard all the prizes! Here you go. Huh? Everything I could find about Sinnoh's space time legends! Fantastic! Thanks so very much! TEAM GALACTIC COMMANDER MARS TEAM GALACTIC COMMANDER Where's Heatran? Excellent. Now we can begin in earnest. The Flame Plate. More beautiful every time I see it. It's supposed to be beautiful! It's one of the plates said to hold the power of Arceus. Whatever, let's get this started. Yes, I understand. We will now begin the Heatran experiment. Team members stand by! Plate… Commence vibrations. Heatran, I need you to lend me your power now. Use Magma Storm! I'm confirming energy output! Both the hyper vibration and energy rate are increasing in tandem! The dream of Team Galactic! The first step in the creation of a brand new world! Not so fast. We will need far more power than this to open the dimensional portal. It's exceeding critical levels! Geo! What is it, Pikachu? Something doesn't seem right! Let's go see! - Mm. - Mm. The first step in our experiment is a success. That's it. I can confirm that the energy produced has affected the dimensional barrier. Excellent. Now we can open the door to Master Cyrus! Pika! What's up, Pikachu? Is something in there? What is that awful sound? Look at that! Chingling! Ching! Bronzong! Bron! Bronzong? Bronzong! Chin, chin! - Pika, pika! - Grookey, key! Hey, knock it off! What's the matter with all of you? Piplup, use whirlpool! - Pika. - Grookey, key. Nothing like a little cold water to wake you up! Piplup! - Pikachu. - Piplup. Are you okay? It's hurt, isn't it? What's that? Huh? - Pika! - Piplup! - Grookey. - It's Azelf! - Uxie! - And Mesprit too! Legendary Pokémon! Azelf. The Willpower Pokémon. A Psychic type. Azelf is called the Being of Willpower. It is said to have given people the strength of mind to deal with life's difficulties. Uxie. The Knowledge Pokémon. A Psychic type. Uxie is called the Being of Knowledge. It is said to have given people the wisdom to solve life's problems. Mesprit. The Emotion Pokémon. A Psychic type. Mesprit is called the Being of Emotion. Legends say it introduced people's hearts to feelings like joy and sadness. They've got such amazing powers! Is that… What's going on? - That's Arceus… - Mm… - That's Arceus. - It tried to tell us something! Hm. How can you two be so calm at a time like this? Because Dawn and I had lots of adventures in Sinnoh before. Along with the Lake Guardians, we helped save Dialga and Palkia. What? That's amazing! I think Arceus and that fire were a message. We have to find out what it could mean. Let's go to the Pokémon Center! All hyper vibration activity. It's been stabilized. Saturn, now! Attention, everyone! It's finally time to put our plan into action. As rulers of the new world, we will bring Master Cyrus back! Team Galactic. Dedicated to building a new world where war does not exist. But their plan would destroy the world as we know it. Their leader was charismatic, but behind that facade… was a burning ambition that caused him to summon the Legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia and use them to open a gate in the space time continuum. Ash, his friends, and the Lake Guardians stopped the plan, but Cyrus left his team behind and vanished through the gate. Now that we have Heatran's power, our preparations are complete. Soon we will open the gate in space time! This is it. The first step in the construction of the new world! We start at 1800 hours! Everyone stand by! Yes, sir! Eyewitness reports of unusual activity have all involved Pokémon who live on Mount Coronet. Some people are wondering if there's a connection between this activity and the deviations in the magnetic field near Mount Coronet several hours ago. Chingling is all better now. Brock! Now what are the odds that all three of us would end up here together at the exact same time? So Brock, a while back we saw Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit, see? One at a time! How am I supposed to understand any of this with you both talking at once? It's nice to meet you! My name is Goh! Grookey. Oh. Nice to meet you. I'm Brock. Ash and I traveled together for a long time. Ash told me about it. First a Gym Leader, then a Pokémon Breeder, now a Pokémon Doctor in training! I've been traveling around with Goh. For a while now! - Blissey! - Pika! - Brock, is that your Blissey? - Yeah! It evolved from Happiny to Chansey and now it's my indispensable assistant! - As is Croagunk. - Ah. Long time, no see, Croagunk! Croagunk! Hey, Brock… Yeah. I saw it on the news. It seems to me that the warping magnetic field affected Chingling. Let's go to Mount Coronet! We really need to find the cause! We will. Leave everything to me! Man, this is fast! No need to worry! I use it for Pokémon house calls all the time. It's quite convenient. And quick! Time to begin the operation! Beginning! Let's see… The message wasn't so much from the Lake Guardians, but from Arceus, is that correct? You're right! Ah, I should transmit all of this to Cynthia, so she can help out on this too. The plate beam is standing by. All systems are operational. It's now or never, Heatran. Use Magma Storm! The energy rate is rising! We're above critical levels! Energy generator is operational! - Fire at once! - Commencing fire! Huh? - Pika? - Piplup. Over there! From the foothills of Mount Coronet! All right, Brock, let's go over there! Right. As we calculated… There are reactions in the space time phasing, and the dimensional gate is expanding at a rapid pace! Almost there, Master Cyrus! Now! Heatran, use Magma Storm! The rate of energy growth has expanded even more! Look! At the dimensional gate… Heatran, we need more, more! We can't raise the rate any further, it's going to overload! We can't stop it now! The dimensional gate is about to open! Mars is right! We mustn't stop now! We'll soon find Master Cyrus! The energy generator system is damaged! The energy's reversing! - It's reversing? - No, we can't! Not when we're so close! Heatran, what's going on? Heatran, return! Retreat now! Why is this happening? Let's go. Hold on! Could it be Heatran's Flash Fire Ability gone haywire? Flash Fire Ability? You mean all this started from a Pokémon's Ability? The energy released by the plate was far too powerful. And with that overwhelming power, it brought forth a colossal change in its form! - Heatran! - After it! Pika. What's that? Heatran? But how did it get like that? Wait. Do you mean the flame that the Lake Guardians showed us was actually… Not good! The forest! Where does it think it's going off to? Wait. Is it going to the Spear Pillar? Excellent. Keep on going! You can still open the dimensional gate! Pika! Is it headed for the Spear Pillar? What is it trying to do? That was right where Team Galactic summoned Dialga and Palkia before! Team Galactic… It can't be! We'll get ahead of Heatran, then we can stop it! - Right! - Got it! - It sure is hot… - Grookey. Pika? First we have to put out that enormous fire! - And water's what we need! - Piplup? Time for a Water type team up! Wait, this situation is way too big! This is beyond the scope of a normal Pokémon battle, so we need a plan! Toxic! Hm? A Toxicroak? Huh? - Pika! - Piplup! Hey. Isn't that… Team Galactic! - Purugly, let's go! - Skuntank, let's go! What are they doing here? I never expected to see all of you again! Team Galactic. The Sinnoh police should have broken you up already! Thanks for the worthless explanation. Now, I'd ask you not to interfere. You're the ones! You did that to Heatran! What are you guys after? I see no reason to answer that. Huh? Hey, look over there! - Whoa! It's Azelf! - And Uxie… Mesprit too! Hm? Are they trying to stop us? I won't allow that! There has been a sudden increase in air temperature in the vicinity of Mount Coronet. The Sinnoh Weather Service has determined that the cause is the mountain forest fire you're now seeing. The heat is intense! What happened to that Heatran? Hm. I can only think of one thing. Some power other than the Heatran itself is at work here. What is it now? Wait. This feeling is familiar. Croag! - Pika. - Piplup. Heatran was there in the fire! So then, that was the real Heatran? Yeah. That huge body may just be made of energy in the form of fire. It looked like Heatran was in a daze. Then how is it rampaging? And there was something like a big plank inside, right? What was it? The Lake Guardians! Now, Toxicroak! Use Sludge Bomb! Toxi… croak! Now, Skuntank! Use Flamethrower! Skun… tank! Purugly, use Shadow Ball! Huh? Stop, Team Galactic! Pika! How is interfering with us going to help you? I want Pokémon to live free! Azelf and the others want us to help them! And that's just what we'll do! Playing hero, huh? What was that plank? It's the thing driving Heatran mad, isn't it? Oh, please! So they don't know! Listen up. It's the Flame Plate. Flame Plate? Some say the Plates exist in order to increase Arceus's power. This Plate wants to return to its home. Back home to the Original One, Arceus. Because of that, the dimensional gate will open. It's just what we want. What? A dimensional gate? You're summoning Dialga and Palkia? All we want is one thing. And that's Master Cyrus! Cyrus? The Team Galactic boss? The one they said vanished through a dimensional gate. You and your big mouth. What does it matter? After all, they won't be needed in our new world anyway. Their knowing won't affect anything. We'll use all we have to get rid of them, won't we? Of course we will. - Now, use Shadow Ball! - Use Flamethrower! Use Thunderbolt! Use Bubble Beam! Pika… chu! We're gonna save Heatran, you hear me? It's because of your selfishness that so many Pokémon have to flee! Because of you, we saw the forest burned to the ground in a single instant! You robbed the Pokémon of their home! Hey, Grookey. The heat is dangerous. Back in your Poké Ball. Grookey. Piplup, piplup. Now, Cinderace. Go! Cinderace! - Pikachu! - Piplup! Everybody, let's go. Isn't that quaint? "Everybody, let's go." They're really annoying me! Though being ambitious is a good thing. Even if the time they have left is so short. But still, I won't allow anyone to be an obstacle between us and the new world! We will secure Heatran's path forward. We can't allow them to approach. - Heatran must proceed! - That's obvious. Now, you three, attack! Pyro Ball! Cinder… ace! Use Thunderbolt! Pika… chu! Bubble Beam, let's go! Ash, Goh, Dawn! I'll hold Team Galactic here while you join up with Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit to help Heatran! - Right! Let's do it! - Yeah! - Pika! - Piplup! - Please be careful, Brock! - Thanks. Toxicroak, stop them! Toxi… croak! Now you're facing me! Go, Steelix! Go, Blissey! Blissey! Quick, Steelix, use Stone Edge! Blissey, Dazzling Gleam! Blissey… Blissey! Hit it with Mega Punch! Blissey. Blissey. Blissey! Blissey! - Pikachu. - Piplup. Cinderace. Pika, pika! - We can't get close to it! - It's too hot! All right, then… Dracovish! I choose you! Dracovish! I know who I'm gonna choose. Inteleon, let's go! Inteleon! Cinderace! Azelf! Uxie! Mesprit! Please use Psychic to help us out! 'Kay, Dracovish, Water Gun, let's go! Inteleon, use Snipe Shot! Intel… Inteleon! Now, Piplup, Whirlpool! - Piplup! - Dracovish! Inteleon. - Perfect! - Now, go! - All right! - Way to go! Cinderace! Such foolishness. Wait. No way! With that heat, water type attacks have the opposite effect. That's my Heatran! Now then, open up the dimensional gate! Now, Skuntank, Flamethrower! Purugly, use Iron Tail! - Oh, no. - A Garchomp? It can't be. Cynthia! The Sinnoh Champion? It appears now we have a new problem. Well, as I thought, it's Team Galactic. Copy. But now they're trapped. The Sinnoh Police will be here soon. I'll report back to you. Now, Brock, please take my Garchomp and head over to Ash's group. I'll take care of Team Galactic. The only way to stop that Heatran is to make sure it has nowhere to walk and Garchomp will be a big help in that. All right. Garchomp, if you please… Croagunk. Blissey. - Croagunk! - Blissey! No. I'm actually telling you to stay here! - Blissey. - Croagunk. So you can protect Cynthia! Steelix, now use Dig! - Blissey! - Grunk! Now, Roserade, full blossom! Rose… rade! Roserade! That's Brock! Cynthia says to make sure Heatran has nowhere to walk! - So let's trap it underground? - Right! If we get it underground, I bet we can put out its fire! Then let's concentrate our attacks toward the area around Heatran's feet! Now you're talking! Let's do this! - Pika! - Piplup! - Now's our chance! - Hm. Use Dig! Now, Pikachu! Iron Tail, let's do it! Pika… Pika! Cinderace, use Pyro Ball! Cinde… race! Come out, Mamoswine! Mamo! Use Ancient Power! Mamo… swine! - All right! - Pika! - Huh? - What? Petal Blizzard! - What's going on? - It can't be! The dimensional gate! Master Cyrus! Looks like we won. The dimensional gate is opening! What have you done? - It's moving! - The plan didn't work! - Dawn! - Just hang on tight! Right! - It's gotten bigger! - And changed forms… You don't think it could be getting power from that dimensional gate, do you? Yes. And due to getting bathed in that power, its body is probably under intense pressure. If this continues, there could be an enormous explosion that blows off the top of Mount Coronet! No one, including Heatran, would be left standing after that. We have to go welcome Master Cyrus back! Skuntank, use Smokescreen! - This is bad! - If it keeps up, it'll explode! What's that? - It's Arceus! - What? It's here for real? Pika? Use Power Whip! Roserade! Rade! Rose! Now why in the world would you go and do that? Skuntank, bite through all of these vines right now! Just give it up. That dimensional gate you yearned to create is being closed by Arceus. Arceus! Don't do that! No! - Arceus… - Awesome! Pika! Arceus! All of us wanna save Heatran! Will you help us out? If that huge Heatran were to explode, the Sinnoh region would never ever be the same! Please, Arceus! Help us! Pikachu! Please, Arceus… - Everyone! - Cynthia! You came to help us, didn't you? Pika, pika! Great. Arceus, thank you so much! - Wow! - Now it's a Water type? - Pika? - Piplup? Amazing! Like it's creating an ocean! An ocean? Is that the power of the Alpha Pokémon? Arceus, the water is dangerous! When we attacked Heatran using water, before this, it caused a massive explosion. It said, "No need to worry," right? Yeah. That's what it sounded like! 'Kay, Arceus! We all trust you! Then we should do whatever we can too. All right! Let's all save Heatran! But how are we supposed to deal with that kind of intense heat? I know! We're gonna fight fire with fire! Hey, Goh, you mind lending me the power of Inteleon and Cinderace? - Cinderace? - Cinderace? - Pikachu, you too! - Pika? It sounds to me like you've got some kind of plan. Yeah! Water type attacks alone won't do the job! Okay! Count me in! - Sounds dangerous! - No need to worry! I wouldn't say that… You're telling me, you want to help too? Piplup! - Okay, I'll go with you! - Thanks, Dawn! Great! You heard all of that. What are we going to do? I guess we'll be their backups. Come back the instant you sense any danger! Right. Azelf, Uxie, Mesprit! You too? Will you please agree to come along with us? Listen, everybody. We'll be back with Heatran in no time! Arceus, we're going to head out! Pika. Amazing. There's no explosion, even with the water hitting that intense heat! That's the power of Arceus. It even has the power to control the natural order of things. Whoa! They're using Psychic! Did they just use that to help us out? Incredible! We're flying! Everyone, let's go! Now! Got it! - Ready, Piplup? - Piplup! We're counting on you… Piplup, use Whirlpool! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt on the Whirlpool! Pika… chu! The electrical energy is coating the water! - That was your plan, wasn't it? - Mm. Piplup, let's go! I think it's working! Now it's our turn. Inteleon, use Snipe Shot! All right! Nice shot, Inteleon! Yeah! We're going inside! - Pikachu! - Look! There's Heatran! We're here to help you! The Plate's out of control! We've gotta hurry! - Pikachu, use Iron Tail! - Pika! Pika… Pika! Quick, Cinderace, use Pyro Ball! Cinde… race! All right! It's wrapped in the Pyro Ball! Cinde… cinderace! Nice! Pikachu, finish with Electroweb! Pika, pika, pika, pikachu! Pika! Pika! So Ash planned that too? Yeah! And now, it has two coats, both fire and electricity! Fire contains the heat, and electricity protects it from water! This way, we'll make it through the water dome and rescue Heatran! - Okay. - We'd better get out quick! Let's move! It's going to blow! - In… - Cinderace. - Pika! - Oh, no. - Now, pull, everyone! - Pika! Intel! Make sure nobody lets go! Hang in there, Heatran! Now, go! Cinderace! - Ash! - Everyone all right? - Heatran. - You got to hang in there! Wake up, please! - Pikachu. - Piplup. Pika? - You okay? - Yeah, you're not hurt, are you? Thanks so much, Arceus! It was because of you that Heatran was saved! Pika, pika! You also saved Mount Coronet and Sinnoh! Thanks to all four of you! - Arceus… - Leaving so soon? Arceus, wait! We want to know where Master Cyrus went, and we know you must know! You go to and from the other world at will, isn't that true? We need to have Master Cyrus with us, so tell us what you know! - We need Master Cyrus… - We're never alone. Arceus is always watching over us. Hoping people and Pokémon work together, overcoming any problems that may appear. And even when our combined strengths aren't enough, Arceus is certain to provide hints to guide us to find the solution. To guide us. But those problems… We must deal with them. We must overcome them. That's why Arceus ultimately left Heatran's rescue in our hands. Cynthia, what about Heatran? That case is closed! Thanks to the bravery of several Trainers and Pokémon. You called me brave, Cynthia! And to celebrate this closed case, we should go on a date… I'll take that as a no. I haven't seen that in a while. Will Brock be okay? That was a bigger investigation than I thought. For sure! - Ash? - Yeah! An investigation by two research fellows ended up turning into a surprise adventure. But with the efforts of Ash and Goh, along with their friends and Pokémon, they were able to save the natural wonder of the Sinnoh region. The Sinnoh region… Thriving since ancient times. A land of legends, glory, and challenges, all watched over by the Alpha Pokémon, Arceus.
