Uh, I need a ride into town. It's an emergency. Could you help me out? Do I have a choice? Yes, hop in. Thanks a lot. What's the emergency, if you don't mind my asking? Um, there's no real emergency now. Do you mind? No. Help yourself. Oh, God, I need a drink. Yeah. Where you heading? Anywhere. You ever been there? Oh, my God. Uh, Holden, I left my briefcase behind. Will you turn around and go back for it, please? I'm sorry. If you don't mind, this is just a minor detour. So, tell me, after anywhere, where would you like to go? First National Bank on the plaza, if you would. Oh. Money. Freedom. I don't give a shit about money. Well, I think maybe I'll have a drop too. A drop a day keeps the devil at bay. Holy shit! Oh, my God! What are we doing here? This is where I left my briefcase. You didn't just leave here, did you? Please, would you turn the car around? Would you just drive out of here? I can't. It's not that simple. You've been cleared. Go on through. Holden, drive over to the gymnasium. Park by the side door. Now, there's the gym door. It's open. You can sneak back in and try your luck. And maybe nobody will even know you've been gone. And don't mention this ride to a soul. No one. Who are you? I'm the wrong man in the right car. Okay. Shit. Mr. Moran? Shh, shh, shh. I'm not breaking out, I'm breaking in. Mr. Moran! I have the plumber here. He wants to talk to you about the risers in the balcony. Mr. Moran, are you in the gymnasium? He's supposed to check in and out whenever he leaves. Find him! The last thing we need is a young guy running loose in this place. Who are you? The right girl in the wrong place. Good-bye. I thought you were long gone. I was. Believe me, I was. But here I am, back for the game. I was so close. I could be-- I could be up on a plane right now. I could be on that 8:00 flight to New York City right now. Goddamn it! I should be out there living instead of rotting away in this stupid hellhole of a place! At least you got laid. Jesus Christ. I'm gonna go fucking crazy in this place. I'm gonna go fucking crazy. That's the idea. Well, I'm just gonna try again, that's all. Would you just chill out, Robin, and wait for your parole? Oh, Denise, please. Come on. Nobody gets out their first time up. You know that. Well, then you'll get out on your next hearing. That's six months from now. Another six months like this, I'm gonna kill myself. Well, you're either gonna go crazy or kill yourself. Take your pick. I will figure something out. I saw you! I did not. Denise, check it out.

Tiernan is known as an advocate of prison reform... and a staunch opponent of capital punishment. Tiernan, who was for 10 years a state representative, says he is the people's choice. Law and order, he says--Vote for me and I'll protect you from these crazy bitches. From the South Facility of the New Mexico State Penitentiary, I'm Ann Marshall, Action 2 News, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Campaign headquarters, can I help you? Hold on. Ladies and gentlemen, I said half an hour. Now, please, give us a break. Harold, I told you. I hate that picture. Kill it. We got 500 of them. Burn 'em. I look depressed. Here you go, sir. Thank you, sir. Now those I like. Use 'em. Good morning, Alice. How are you? Good morning. Fine. You smell very good today. Thank you. James Tiernan's office. Collect from Robin Shea? Just tell him it's the girl in the limo? Campaign headquarters, can I help you? Okay. Come on, Mr. T. Line four. I remember you. I just found out who you are. It's lucky they have a TV in this place. How are they treating you? Okay. I just want to get out so I can vote for you. Well, you better vote for me. I'll send you an absentee ballot, okay? Nah, don't bother. I plan to be out way before election time. My first parole hearing comes up in a month, you know. It's not easy to get out on your first parole. Oh, I know. I know. Which is why I'm calling you, actually. I was thinking since-- since you seem to be the hotshot on prison reform, that, you know, maybe you could, uh, put in a good word for me? What is it you would like me to tell them, what an accomplished escapee you are? No, I'm afraid that I-- I really can't do that. As a matter of fact, I don't think my endorsement would do you much good, Miss Shea. The parole board's gonna want to know that you have a guaranteed job... or you're gonna marry a stable member of the community or something like that. Marry? Okay. Um, I'll get married. Would, um, would you help me out then? Well, um, you tell me... where you're gonna find a stable member of the community in prison first. Let me worry about it, okay? Hi. I'll say one thing for you, you sure make a good entrance. Are you married? - No. - Do you want to marry me? I mean, as a business deal. I need a husband, fast. Wait a second. Is this some kind of joke? No. Huh? I'm serious. I'll pay you $5,000. Jesus. Could you use $5,000? Y-You don't even know my name. Oh, yeah, I do. No, you don't. Mr. Moran. - Mr. Billy Moran. - Robin Shea. I don't want to rush you on this or anything, but I do have to get back to my cell. So... what do you think? I think you should be in a loony bin, not in a prison. Look, I'd live with you for one year until my parole's up and then I'm history. I won't bother you or anything. I don't know. I don't know. I'll think about it. I need to know right away. Well, if you need to know right way, then my answer is no. Well, there's this guy who is like a brother to me. He was always in some kind of trouble, but he played great saxophone. Anyway, one day, he comes knocking on my door. His arm's all fucked up and bleeding. He says, could I please get him out of the state fast, you know. I mean, he couldn't drive. Mm. He was my friend. - I mean, what would you do? - What did you do? I helped him out. We would have made it, too, except for that damn Porsche runs out of gas in the middle of nowhere. I assume this Porsche wasn't yours? No, I borrowed it for the occasion. It's why I'm here, you know. So I guess you're not too interested in this deal, huh? I don't know. Maybe it could work. You realize if-if we do this thing, you've got to be a little more stable. I am totally rehabilitated. Well, I-- I could definitely use some help around the house and all. I'm real good at that. I took care of my parents for seven years. Really? Yeah. And don't forget that five grand. - Where'd you get that money? - My mother left me that money. Honest. So what do you think, Billy? We got a deal? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah? Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Sir, can we just have a minute? You know, this is perfect. You didn't know your first wife either, ol' what's-her-name. You can remember her name. No, I don't. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. No, I don't. Was it Evelyn? Donna. And she don't count. Well, she counted when she ran off with your car, with your bank account, with that asshole from Miami. Excuse me? He was from New Orleans. Well, I hope you got a prenuptial agreement on this one. Blue, she's paying me five grand to do this. And I'm $6,700 short on my mortgage. Damn. I thought you fell in love with some criminal or something. She ain't no criminal. What is this, a boarding school? She ain't no criminal. I'm telling you, there's a good lady inside her. Get your hat off. What's the photographer for, mug shots? Since it is your intention to enter into marriage, join your right hands, please. Declare your consent before God in His church-- Declare them to be husband and wife. You may kiss the bride now. It's great. You married a dyke. What are you crying for? I'm the one that has to get married. I'm just thinking about my second husband Raymond. I sure do miss Raymond. Whatever happened to him? I stabbed him. Let's go. See you next week. See you on the outside. See you. Hi. Mrs. Moran, I'm Rupert Willis, your parole officer. Uh-huh. Nice to meet you. I thought we should have a little get-together chat before your departure. Sure. - Beautiful flowers. - Uh, I didn't send 'em. A friend of yours did. So, are we looking forward to our new life as a married woman? You bet. Good. As you know, Mr. Tiernan has helped your case. It's nice to have friends. We're expectin' to be real proud of your behavior out there. We'll all be keepin' a close eye. Are we understood? Hi. Hi. I got you some flowers. Oh, thanks. Let me help you with--I got it. I got it. No, it's all right. Come on. What's that? It's my baby. What is it, a guitar? Yeah! A bass. Who are those people? Oh, that's, uh, that's my brother Peter... and the little one is my son Timmy. They live with me. Billy, you never told me you had a family. This is Robin. Well, hi. Thanks. Can I have a drag? Thanks. Mm-hmm. Dad, do I have to hide my piggy bank from her? Timmy, that's enough. Well, this is interesting, a family. So, how old are you, Timmy? - He's six. - I hate you. Great kid. You got any more? All right, Timmy, let's go. Come on. Get in the truck. This is really-- I mean, this is really something, you know. Just get in the truck, okay? I finally got away from my own family. Why the hell would I want yours? Will you get in the truck and be nice to them? Oh, God. Jesus. What are you doing? What are you doing? Come on. Let's go. You play bass? Yeah. I play synthesizer. No kidding. Huh. Seems like you're my kind of guy. I'll help clean up as best as I can. I'll drive the kid to school. I'll, uh, mow the lawn, do basic repair work, that kind of stuff. But as far as the cooking goes, forget it. Good night. What are you doing? Reading. I mean, what are you doing out here? Well, this is your house. You get the bedroom. Well, I was thinking that we'd both share the bedroom. Whatever gave you that idea? Whatever gave me that idea? Well, that wasn't part of the deal, Billy. Well, it was never discussed, but I always assumed that it was understood. Not to me. I sleep out here. You know, you got problems, you know that? You're messed up. No, I'm not. I'm just practical. We're in business, Billy. You forget the damn deal! It's our wedding night, for Christ's sake. You're my wife. I am not that kind of wife, Billy. You better understand that right now. I get you out of prison. I give you a chance-- And I don't owe you anything. You did not buy me. I bought my freedom. Been locked up for six months. The last thing I want is to be locked up again. Hey! This ain't no jail. You understand? Oh, yeah? Marriage is. You look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't good for you. What wasn't good for me? When we fucked, for Christ's sakes. Oh, that was great. But that was before we were partners, Billy. Wh-What do you think partners do? Well, Baskin and Robbins are partners. They don't sleep together. This really sucks. At least don't sleep out here. It won't look right. - Yeah, this'll be fine. - Good. Oh, here it is-- Bonnie Buttons. Oh, I bet you like this. I wouldn't fuck this with your dick, okay? Jesus Christ, Al, she's a singer, not a lay. Hey, well, you book her then. I couldn't get her cremated, much less a fucking gig.

No, I'm Robin Shea. I'm a songwriter. I understand that you're booking bands for Rock for Tiernan. Oh? Well, he's a friend of mine. And I was thinking that I should really play at that thing, don't you? I hadn't really thought about it before now, Robin. But now that you mention it-- A lot of people tell me I should go professional. So, you know-- - Oh. In that case, a lot of people can rarely be wrong. - Hey, look, she can't sing, -but, uh, she's got a great ass. -I feel the same way about that. Nice ass, can't fucking sing. You are such bullshit assholes! Do you have any peanut butter? ♪♪ Oh, shit! There is none. I'm sorry. Where's that girl? I don't know. I'm just her husband. Will you open this? Timmy! Look, you just go clean your room, will ya? Huh? Peter, will you put a lid on that?♪♪ Hey! Where'd you get that Jeep? ♪♪ I bought it... four years ago. We're gonna start a band. What? Do you want to start a band? I guess so. Good. I'm gonna round us up some musicians here. Yeah, hi. Is Einstein there, please? Whoa! Where's this taking us? Top floor penthouse. Everybody out. When was your last gig, David? Club West a couple of weeks ago. He got fired. Hey, Hawk, isn't his sacred land? Stolen land. Wait a minute. I don't think this is such a good idea, Robin. Why not? Opera's for everybody. Besides, it's off-season. Oh, shit. It's all right. I found the switch. Einstein's still missing. You know him. "Soon come, mon." Hey, Einstein. I made it. One, two-- All right. So, those are the changes. What do you think? I call it "Newfound Freedom." - Sounds like a tampon ad. - Hey, I like it. Hey, you don't have to sing this thing. I do. Take it easy, mon. Newfound freedom can mean new world. Can mean a lot of things. That's right. Let me see the lyrics. "Take a piece of this action, give in, give in." I'm not singing this. Okay, so I'll sing that part. How's that? Let's try it again. Got it. Why did this guy Tiernan help you? He's a friend of mine. What's that supposed to mean? I gave him a blow job. Here. There's your five grand. Is that how you made this money, blowing democrats? Oh, God. Billy, you are so stupid, you know that? You don't even know what a joke is. I told you my mother left me that money. Is, uh, that the same mother you took care of for seven years or another one? It's the same one. I used to clean up her puke and call the hospital... every time she got bombed and tried to kill herself or tried to kill my dad, who was usually off fucking some topless waitress somewhere. I mean my family was not exactly Leave It To Beaver. Was there something you wanted to do with this money for yourself? You'll think it's stupid. Well, wait a second. Tell me. I mean, I just said something stupid. Well, I started writing these songs in jail. You know, I just needed some way to get it out and... I thought maybe I could cut a demo, you know. It was just an idea. Here, I can't take this money. Not if that's what you were planning to do with it. You keep it. - No way, Billy. A deal's a deal. - It's-- Well, do you have enough cash of your own? I can lend you some. I got some. I got a little left. Thanks. Can I give you a ride somewhere? Nah. I feel like walking. Bye. All right. You take care, okay? Here, got a present for you. Want to know a secret, Mr. Willis? I shoot up in my bellybutton. You think you're awfully clever, don't you, Mrs. Moran? You just breeze by everybody and make smart-aleck remarks. You'll end up back in jail within a month at the rate you're going, young lady. Dad said you're supposed to take me to school today. What? Dad said you're supposed to drive me to school today. Um, uh, why don't you wait for me in my Jeep, okay? I'll be right there. So, Bill, tell me. Does, uh, she have them little numbers on her lingerie too? No. Only on her panties. Well, so, how do you like married life? She's got some funny ideas, but I can straighten her out. Oh, what the hell, Bill? You're a husband, not a social worker. If she gets out of line, you-you smack her. Thanks for the advice, Blue. Hey, what are friends for? Bill, you're not gonna change her. Yeah, I will. - No, you won't. - Yeah, I will. No, you won't. Into what? Yeah, I will. Into a woman. Into a loving, sensitive, caring woman. Feminine and everything. Bill, she's not that kind of woman. Look, you should just be happy that-- that you're getting nooky every night. Robin, I was wondering. If you're gonna be sticking around, I don't know, maybe you can get into this marriage groove, you know what I mean? Peter, Raphael has an expression-- "No confusion, no delusions." As long as I'm married to Billy, I could never be his wife. Maybe when we're divorced, we can work something out, you know. Man, you're tough. You think it's easy for me? Okay, okay. I heard you the first time. Oh, God, I'm so late. My teacher is gonna kill me. Let's see. You know something, when you're this late, you might as well not go in at all. I got something to do today. You want to come with me? Huh? ♪ You wanna to be special ♪ You wanna be somebody ♪ You wanna have everything ♪ Ah ah Thank you. ♪ You better listen ♪ I got news for you ♪ Nothing in this world comes free ♪ ♪ Any fool will tell you - ♪ If you wanna last ♪ Any fool will tell you ♪ Nothing comes easy ♪ Whoops. That's not great. Thanks. Hi. Miss, may I have your name? We're expected. Hi. Hello. My guard told me some hooligan was trying to storm my gates. Was that you? I wanted to thank you for helping me out. Thank you. This is Timmy Moran. He's my, uh, something. I don't know what to call him. This is Mr. Tiernan. How do you do, Tim? The kitchen is right back that way. Just ask the cook. She'll give you a little snack, okay? Go ahead. Well, now that you're here, would you like to come in? You know, we had a great response to the article about your release. I've asked my press people to arrange for another photo session... with you and your family. Well, another photo session? Let's not overdo it. You know, I'm not Suzy Homemaker. Yes, I know you're not. Al Lawrence from Desert Moon told me that you threw a grapefruit through a glass case. Is that true, Robin? Excuse me. That guy is an asshole. Yeah, well, maybe so, but, uh, it's not good, Robin. It's not good for you, and it's not good for me. No? He also told me that you, uh, asked for a spot in my fund raiser. - I didn't know you had a band. - I didn't have a husband a little while ago either. Look, I don't want you to make me regret this. I told him to put you in. You did? Yes. Thank you. Ah, you're welcome. Excuse me. Harold, I-- No, not Tuesday, not tomorrow. Come on in. Harold, look, um, call me back in about an hour, okay? Hiya, Tim. How old are you? Six. Six? My God. This is my pool room. Do you like it? Is this your wife? Yes. She's beautiful. Thank you. - Yeah! - Good. - Very good. - Oh, hi. You must be Mrs. T. I'm Robin Shea Moran. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Um, hello, sweetheart. Hi, darling. Robin is the young inmate I'm helping. Yes. Yes, of course. I recognize you from the paper. Timmy, this is Mrs. Tiernan. Hi. Timmy. Don't forget about our appointment, sweetheart. If you'll excuse me? Nice to meet you, Timmy. Yes. It's a happy family. I want everyone to smile. Everyone look at me and smile. All right. I want a kiss across the candle. Mr. Moran, closer. Closer, please. I'll burn my hair. Well, it's just a photo. It doesn't matter. Nice work. How much did you pay her to do it? She volunteered... more or less. Mm-hmm. Maybe you should put the emphasis on the less, James. She's not very convincing as the happy hausfrau. My, my. We're awfully cynical tonight, aren't we, darling? I like a jealous wife. No, sweetheart, I'm just trying to look out for your best interests, and she's not one of them. Actually, she's quite a crowd-pleaser. It's like having my own little-- my own little March-of-Dimes girl. More like a call girl. Mmm! It's not in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Honey, I know it's not in. I haven't got it out yet. Give me a minute. Shh! My diaphragm. Oh, my God. Geez. Billy! What? Billy! This is a disaster. Billy! What is it? What? The room's got a leak. It's a swamp in here. Oh, shit. Yeah, I gotta fix that. Yeah, fix it. What, you want me to go up on the roof now and fix it now? Yeah. Do something. Oh, that's what you do. And where am I gonna sleep? I don't care. Sleep with me. I don't care. Look, if you're worried about me crawling all over you, I can control myself... - Well-- - if you can. Good night. Good night. I'm sorry. - Sorry. - That's okay. It's really a shame we're married. Why can't Robin take me to school again today? Because it takes her three hours to get you there... and then I have to spend another half hour explaining it to your teacher, that's why. It was really stupid of her. - I don't care. I like her. - Close the door. You know, instead of, uh-- While he's soloing, you think you could shadow me on the bass? You want me to double it? Yeah. Yeah. One, two, three, go. Well, say adios to Fast Burger. I got canned. What happened this time? I don't know. I-- I was late 'cause of a couple of band rehearsals. It was a lame job anyway. You want a job at Fast Burger? - Do you get free French fries? - All the fries you can eat. You're supposed to be doing your homework, not getting paint all over the floor. Put 'em away. Billy, relax. It's not gonna kill him to take a break. You telling me how to raise my son? No. I'm just saying I spend more time with him than you do. You spend more time with him, huh? Huh? And what do you think I do with my time, huh? What do you think I do with my time? You think I'm out playing football? Or getting fired from stupid-shit jobs? No. I'm getting up at 6:00 every morning and going to work... to make the money that pays for this house that you live in! And to buy the food that I'm cooking for you to eat! Someday I'd like to see how well you do being a mother and a father all by yourself. I really would. I've been doing it for five years now. You think it's easy? Stop feeling so sorry for yourself, Billy. I'm feeling sorry for myself? I'm feeling sorry for myself? Oh, my goodness. Cut it out, Billy. My God. Look, what's bugging you? You don't want to cook, fine. Look... I'll take care of the hamburgers today, all right? Hey, Tim. Come on. Torro! Torro! Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! Well, I fixed the hamburgers.

There's this club in town called Las Quinellas, and every Thursday they have amateur night, and tonight's Thursday. I put your name on the guest list, even though I don't think there is one. All right. Thanks for the ride. I'll see you later at the club, okay? Yeah? Yeah. Billy, can I come in and see what you're doing? All right. But you gotta promise not to touch anything, okay? Okay.

Come on up here, and we'll take a look at the studio. - - This is Mr. Davey's studio. - Oh, wow! Oh, wow! - Get out! Get outta here! I'm sorry to bother you before your cocktail party, Mr. Tiernan. - I thought you'd want to see those. - It's all right, Mr. Willis. You're very lucky, James, that it was Mr. Willis who got ahold of these pictures... instead of God knows who. She left the museum before the police got there. Fortunately, I persuaded them to drop charges. Who told you to do that? Well, I just assumed, 'cause of the interest you took in getting her released, that that's what you'd want me to do. You should've consulted me first, Mr. Willis. I'm afraid that Miss Shea is getting just a little too dangerous for me. I'm gonna have to wash my hands of the whole matter. Thanks. - - Say, we gonna have a floor show? Okay, gang, this next group comin' up... might be just a little different than what you've been used to. But what the hell?

Damn, you had it under control before I even got there. I'm sorry for what happened. I'm sorry, too, honey, but I don't need that kind of crap in my joint. Just get out and don't come back, please. Did you call the cops? No, I didn't call 'em, but I should've called 'em. I'll talk to you later, Paul. Goddamn it, you got to be down there when I need--Hey, Tom, is there a Robin Moran here tonight? What did she do? Captain got a call. She's violated her parole. Somethin' about hanky-panky business up at the Davey's Museum. Parole officer says she's goin' back to jail. Is she here? Yeah, she's in there. Unit 24, Unit 24 clear. Is Mrs. William Moran here? Uh, no. She's not. You don't mind if I check myself? Please. Dad? Where's Robin? I think she's gonna be goin' away. Forever? I don't know. I hope not. There's about $3,000 in there. It should be enough to get you started somewhere. I don't want this money. Robin, the police came by here last night. Your parole has been revoked. I know. I was hiding out by the cliffs all night. I was scared. You gotta go away before they come back. Go where? Anywhere. And do what? I'm always running away. If they don't catch up with me now, catch up with me six months from now. If I go back to jail, doesn't mean my life is over. You could leave now and start a new one. Gonna miss you around here. It's my whole stupid life right here in this suitcase, you know. That's kinda pathetic, don't you think? No. I'm too tired to go anywhere. I don't even care anymore. Hey. Hey. Look, you wanna fight this thing? I'll help ya. We'll get the best lawyer. Huh? What's the point? It's black and white. No. Nothing's black and white anymore, Robin, not even between you and me. I'm really sorry about what I did last night. That's just who you are, Billy. It's not who I wanna be. I mean, it's not easy changing your whole life in just a couple of weeks, you know. I do know. Anyway, I definitely, definitely got rid of something. Definitely. What? My wife. The one in my head. I killed her off. Just murdered her. Well, great. I just hope we can go to the same jail. That's fine with me. Oh, great. Watch your step. There you go. But it is the first time I've ever endorsed a gubernatorial candidate. Tonight it is with great pleasure that I endorse my good friend, James Tiernan, the next governor of the state of New Mexico! Lumbre del Sol, ladies and gentlemen. Hey, the partners in crime! Where's the ex-con? I hear she got arrested screwin' in public. Yeah, she went back to prison this afternoon. Come on. This is a universal event. We wanted everything in there. Let's not forget anybody, Excuse me. You Albert Lawrence? Yeah. Who are you? Ernie Appleton, Internal Revenue Service. Listen, we gotta go somewhere and talk. You're in some big trouble, Al. Uh, yeah, Ernie, I was meaning to call you guys about that. Ernie, I can explain this thing. Let me out of here. That night you went out on your date-- it was him, wasn't it? Listen, you knock 'em dead out there, okay? Hi, everybody. For God's sakes, get her off that stage. Hi, Mr. T. My name's Robin Shea Moran. You might've read about me in the paper. I'm the ex-con Mr. Tiernan helped get out of jail. I've never really made a speech before, but I did want to have a chance... to tell Mr. Tiernan that he changed my life. He risked a lot helping me, and I just want to let him know that the risk paid off in full. In gratitude, I'd like to play a song I wrote with my band.

Thank you. Thank you, but the person who really deserves the applause tonight... is our next governor. Come on up, Mr. T. Thank you. Thank you. Well, you certainly know how to steal a show, Mrs. Moran. I wish I could do that, you know? I learned a lot in jail and so could you. I'll do more than that if you make me governor. Thank you. You're going home. Enjoy your freedom. What's that? 8:00? It's 8:00? I set it for 6:00. What happened? I'm already two hours late for work. God, Billy, when you're this late, you might as well not go in at all. Very true. Hmm?
