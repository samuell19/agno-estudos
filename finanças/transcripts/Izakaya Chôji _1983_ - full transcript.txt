Takes away your tears and brings you dreams And brings you dreams Welcome back! Sayo! Mum! You scared me. I waited for you near the marketplace,as we had arranged. But I was told someone saw you get in a taxi. I thought... You thought I ran away from you'? Sayo! Don't do this anymore. Even if you disappear again, I'll find you and bring you home. Thank you so much! Chéji, your snack bar is so good... that you could easily double your profit. Here you go. We're planning to increase the turnover to 40,000 yen a day Incredible. Madam, what do you think about expanding'? It's like a little restaurant now. When my husband resigned, he just wanted to set up a stall. Really? Yes. You're a strange couple. Maybe we are. I still haven't had a chance to eat here. I'm so busy dealing with money all the time. This smells good. Would you like to try'? Would be great. Just a minute. This is actually very simple food. Kazuto, you're going to fall in the water. I want to go over there. No, go play elsewhere. Here. You can go that way The train is departing! - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Ei. - Yes'? The food was delicious. Thank you. You're early today You're welcome. Good afternoon. I've been invited to the docks where you used to work. There's going to be a big ceremony to celebrate the launch of a huge ship. Oh? Were you invited as a guest? No, I'll be helping with the banquet. You'll sing for the guests then. Probably Wakakusa can't sing. No, it's not that. Your colleague Arita... wouldn't want to singLove Story In Ginza with me. You're early today I need to talk to you. I heard, you're going to open a joint at the shipyard. You'll need a sound system. I know someone who can arrange an audio room for you for 3 million yen. It's raining non-stop outside the window My clothes are soaking wet It's not that I don't have an umbrella I just don't want to go home All I want is to get drunk and forget her You're mistaken! There's nothing good in the capital now. Turn around. Look at me. Hey you! I'm doing it for you, after all! You said you wanted to relocate... so I found a place for you! It's not far from the station and belongs to Uemura, a member of the City council. Is that the 100-tsubo warehouse? Exactly Uemura promised to rent 1O tsubo for free. How much is one tsubo these days'? 1.5 million yen! And don't forget, he's a City council member. It's very nice of you, Kavvahara. Thank you so much. But I'd like to postpone the deal for another year. I need some more time to think. What are you talking about? What kind of man are you'? I can't stand sissies like you. I've talked to Uemura a hundred times. You're right. And all that for nothing? Now I understand why you left the docks. You're just a sissy And your joint sucks. So long! - Was that the director of Sanko-taxi'? - Yes. Kavvahara finished the same school as me, only a year earlier. He's always been a leader. They went in the direction of the railroad. It must be the cement plant. No, they went to the Kamiya farm. Welcome! Welcome! There's a fire somewhere. Probably on the Kamiya farm. All the guys from YMA went there. Maybe, you should go too'? If you would take care of this here. Move it! Ivvashita! Ah, Ei, you're here as well. Everything that the owners had built... is gone now. It's too late. Is she all right? Sayo, you mean? Yes, she's fine. There she is. Do you want to talk to her? Well... thank you so much. No, thank you. His wife has run away from home again. Yes, he says he hasn't seen her since the day before yesterday She still can't forget the person she loved before she got married. Firemen thinks the fire was her fault. It looks like arson. Really? This friend of hers... Who is he? Eiji Fujino. Fujino? He used to be a high school star. He and lvvashita, the butcher, were the best baseball players in the area. The university team coach came to watch them play l also had a dream of becoming a professional baseball player. But then I injured my shoulder. Anyway what does he do now? Nothing special. It's Chéji, after all. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you for the food. Be careful, Akimoto. Don't worry I'm not drunk. I haven't had a single drop. I promised my wife a ring for her birthday So I'm saving up... Take care. - Girls, how about going to Mount Hakodate?- No way Old fart... Did you hear that? Unbelievable. HEM boy! Hang on. I've got to think about my wife. Goodbye. It's just some change. - Is it really? - Honestly You had 1O thousand yen in your hand. - What?- 1O thousand. - Hey lvvashita.- What? What's going on here'? Forget it... I'm the head of the company dealing in minkfur coats, don't forget that. The contents of this money boxdoesn't concern you. You're the head of the company consisting of one person. Besides, it's a party to celebratethe opening of a new joint. - Behave yourself. - I'll take it out. Don't you dare. Watch out, Eiji! Defend yourself! Ei, please... He's a dangerous man. You got drunk and now you're misbehaving. Alright, alright. Consider it my contribution. What contribution? When Chéji Snack Bar relocates... I won't need to give you money Now forget about it. It will be our little secret. Alright? Okay thank you. What's that siren? And what about the fire in the Kamiya farm? Has the lady come back? No. Police are looking everywhere for her. Last spring, she went to the mountainswith her family. They looked there too. They even called all the psychiatric clinics in the area. Why psychiatric clinics? They wonder if she's gone mad. Some people think so. Those young men in the YMA are decent guys. The current YMA is a disgrace. One could even sayYMA doesn't exist in this city It's a new generation. Remember the parties we had twice a year? And then all the fun we had every week.Didn't we, Ei? We ate, drank, we just went wild. Younger days... Now we're old and enjoy the simple things. Yes. Young people, they have driving, golf and disco. Our school days have died out. So her disappearance... revived it in a way. You can go home. Alright. And you can go to Akahito-Doshi together. No. I've spent everything I had. Hello? Chéji here. Hello... Hello... Who's calling so late? Hello... They hung up. Hello? Sayo, please... come to table 30. Sayo come to table 30. Sayo they want you. Table 30. Does Shigeko know? About what? About you and Sayo. You really don't know? You don't have the faintest ideawhere Sayo might be? Listen, lvvashita... Alright, alright. Don't get so worked up. l just thought... You're a terrible person. - Hello. - Good afternoon. Sore... Yaren-soran-soran-soran... Hai... hai... Tonight, on a silk pillow Tomorrow, on waves on board the ship Teiyasa-e. .. enya. .. ansano-dokkoisho... A-a. .. dokkoisho. .. dokkoisho... I 'm Nagata from the Hokuyo docks. Alikko and Wakakusa are singing for you. The next song is A Three- Year Romance. Thank you! Let's drink to you! Bottoms up! If I'd known I'd be singing, I'd have put on a kimono. But a singer also gets a fee. This time, people from the Sapporo Head Office... decided to invite Wakakusa Why are you Saying this? When it's over, let's go to Cheji's. Is it because he used to work here? No. But launching such a huge ship is a great event. Why did Chéji leave his job? Well... it's just... Sir... Thank you for the performance. Arita, you invited a great performer. Let me introduce General Manager Yoshino. What an distinguished man! You look like an English gentleman. General Manager enjoyed your performance very much. Would you mind keeping me company? Can you wait for me? I have to meet a new person. A three-year romance is a long one Now it's serious ls she going to talk about Chéjiwith the General Manager? Why not? Haven't you heard the talks about replacing Ochi with Fujino'? Fujino is Chéji. If she managed to get to Yoshino, she's not going to let him slip out of her hands. You think so, Arita? Thank you so much! Thank you so much! I might have drunk a bit too much. Good afternoon. It was so much fun! Thank you. Are you all right? It was great. Goodbye... - Mine, did you sing Soran-Bushi again? - No, why? - Mineko likes to have a drink or two.- Does she? - Pay us a visit sometime. - Of course! Well... thank you and goodbye. Bye-bye! This time I had a real date with the General Manager. No doubt. What is it, Sir? What happened? Oh... lsee... See you again sometime, Sir'? Take care. I'm home. I bought you a tie. It's cheap, but nice. The head of the department in the Head Office... should wear a stylish tie. Do you like it? I quit. What? Why? What happened? Do you have any ideawhat my job in the department is like? It's terrible. I can't do this. Until yesterday I'd workedside by side with my friends... and tomorrow, I have to relocate and become their superior. I don't need that. What are you going to do now? Bastards! It's terrible... How could you? You didn't even discuss it with me. I'm not giving you any more saké. Listen... - will you take me as an apprentice?- What'? Most people want a stable income. But I want to set up my own stall. I've always wanted to sellmotsuyaki. Teach me, please. Since my father was a sailor... I wanted to marry an office employee. It was one of the reasonswhy I agreed to this marriage. I was so scared whenmy husband left his job. I was anxious about opening our own place. But... office employees also need to eat. I dream aboutstarting my own business too. But I don't have the courage to make the first step. Chéji did the right thing. In any case, it worked out well. You really think so? Except making your wife cry isn't very good. The fire's gone out. Hello. I was worried. I saw Yoshino and I thought he was looking for you. I'll go buy cigarettes. - Heat up some sake, please. - Alright. - Was Kavvahara here last night'? - Yes. What about that conversation about the land? What have you decided? Why aren't you satisfied? Matsukavva was my teacher. Is that where his place is? I've been there once. Since he was my teacher... I can't open my place near his. You're afraid he might lose his clients to you? I understand. But that building is 20% bigger than your teacher's. It's not about that. Here you are. What is it about? Mr. Kavvahara? He understands everything himself. He can't continue to be a leader among boys like he used to. Welcome. What would you like? - Do you want beer'? - Yes. I'll have beer as well. I'm sorry we're not open yet. We open at 6. Welcome back... Why are you here'? I need to prepare for tonight... I was worried about you. I'm glad you're safe. Those guys from YMA... You're a terrible person, Eiji. I remember your 'forgive me'... and I'm drawn back here each time. Forgive me. There, you said it again. Is this your first time here'? This is what I do now. Eiji. You're a bad person, because... You're a coward. That's why it turned out like this. Those guys from YMA... are really good. They rebuilt the house. They even conducted a ceremony to consecrate the land. Everyone says it went very well. Have you heard about it'? Sayo! Sayo! Father, why aren't you eating? Just a minute. Hey Sano! Could you make some space for me'? Of course. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Sit here. - Thank you. - Here's a present for you. - What is it? I bought it near the station. Is this from Orizume's box store'? - Yes. It opened recently - That's right. - Ladies first. - Let everyone try A treat from Mr. Sano, the city councilor. Here you are. Everyone should try We have one more lady over here. Would you like to try? Thank you. And for this lady Help yourself, Mafam. And for Chéji. - Would you like some'? - Later. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'd like a bottle of beer. - Me too. Yoko, there are some fat pieces of rolls left. What is it? He said I'm fat... Yoko, Sano didn't call you fat. Yes, he did! He said 'fat'. 'Fat piece'. I'm a piece! Yoko! She misheard it. I said, 'There are some fat pieces of rolls left.' Shut up! Who's asking you, you petty bureaucrat? - He's not a petty bureaucrat. - Both of you are miserable bureaucrats! Look at yourself, you cheap hired worker. You eat and get fat off our taxes! Your daughter is the one who got fat. A father is responsible for his daughter, not the City council. You bastard! Stop it! Sano, stop it! And you too! Sano, enough! - What did you say'? - Sano, stop! Kavvahara, I apologize. You may hit me if it makes you feel better. Let go of me. Let go! Darling! Are you all right'? - Are you hurt'? - I'm fine. He's bleeding. Get a towel. Chéji, are you okay? Get out of the way! Shit! Out of the way! Kavvahara! Kavvahara! Kavvahara, come out! No, l just fell. There was no fight. But we received a call concerning a fight. It must have been a mistake. Sit and have a drink with us. We're on duty As you like. Someone mixed up 110 and 119. Hold on, here it is. A person named Kavvahara hit you. ls that right'? No. Like I said, l fell. Kavvahara has nothing to do with it. Hello, is this lvvashita? Can I speak to your husband? Yes. At Matsu kavvafs? Do you know him? He has a place nearby My husband is in a new place not far from it. There's a party there. If it's urgent, go to Matsukavvafs. So... Eiji... Fujino is there too'? Yes, Chéji is there too. Hello... what's your name? Hello... hello... If parents believed their children... Ei! He wanted to be an artist ever since he was a child. I don't like all this make-up, though. I can't say I achieved a lot But, at least, I followed my own path I know why Chéji rejected the land you found for him. He didn't want to create problems for me. He studied with me only for 1O days... but he calls me his teacher. Who told you that? Horie, my current apprentice. Ivvashita told me as well. Chéji, it's for you. Thank you. Chéji here. Hello... Sayo, hello... Sayo, is that you'? Hello? Sayo, is that you'? Eiji! I've been wanting to call you, but I didn't have the courage. Besides, Shigeko is always there. Sayo, where are you'? Come back. I'm not coming back. Sayo! Sayo! Hello! Can l join you'? Welcome. I finally managed to get away from Kyoto. Only for today Here's a souvenir for you. - Great! - What is it'? Sushi, probably Now Chéji doesn't have to worry about sushi. I hope those rolls aren't too fat'? 'Fat piece'! I'll have the same as usual. Alright. It's 9:00 already Boss wants to set sail at 9:00. I'm off. Give me the bill. Thank you. I'm in good shape. It's 4,800 yen. Keep the change. No, Te. Take it, please. Keep it. Thank you, but, please, take it. Our ship departs at 9:00. Don't you understand? Don't you? It's lights-out time. Chéji, you're a crook. You're trying to indulge your clients... by accepting everything without arguing. There's nothing unusual about that. I only wanted everything to be correct. Then what is this? This wasn't on the bill. If you want everything to be correct, charge for this as well. The aim of business is making profit... and not doing everything correct. Excuse me, it's mine. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. The whole world is in crisis and you want to stay clean. The fact that we didn't agree was a big mistake. Kavvahara, enough. Drink some more. When I was at Matsukavvafs, he told me everything. You rejected the piece of land that I found for you... because you feel indebted to Matsukavva. Enough with this fake nobility If that was the only reason, why didn't you tell me at once? You told lvvashita and Horie, so why didn't you tell me'? Say it to my face. What is it? Do you take me for a fool? I want to know... It's not true. Stop lying to me! Kavvahara, stop it. There are other customers here. You're not yakuza, after all! Only yakuza behave like that. What did you say motherfucker? Who are you calling yakuza'? Kavvahara! Kavvahara! Stop it! Kavvahara! This is ridiculous. You're drunk on saké. You mustn't behave like this. You behave like a child. What? This joint is only for degenerates like you. It's total shit! Hey Chéji! You are shit and your joint is shit. Remember that. Kavvahara, hang on! Hey Chéji! Chéji! Hang on a minute... I despise your indecisiveness. But don't worry I'm not going to return to our conversation. I just want you to speak your mind. Kiutaro, come here. I met Kiutaro by chance. We didn't arrange this. Chéji... when we last met... you were talking on the phone. It doesn't concern you. But the one whom it concerns is here! You were talking on the phone, weren't you'? I think you have something to say to him. I'm very sorry Fujino! Tell me where Sayo is. I have no idea. Hey Chéji! Don't you understand? You're going to have problems with the police. I don't know anything. Better speak now. But I don't know anything. Honestly If that's how you want to play it. You stubborn bastard! Are you all right? What happened? Thank you for helping me yesterday You drank too much yesterday It's not good. What? Yes, that's true. It was a good game. But it seemed to me there was something where with your shoulder. Actually I had a shoulder injury myself. That's why I had this impression... that the same thing happened to you. No, I'm fine. Hey Kiriyama! We're leaving. Well, I gotta go. I run a snack bar in Suehiroché, called Chéji. If you're ever in the area, stop by. I'll treat you to motsuyaki. Thank you. So long. Akimoto! Ah, Chap! What are you doing? I dropped something. This one. And this one. I finally made up my mind. Are you betting? No. Well, there'll be more races. But without my favorites. Besides, I need to go see my teacher. Is that the one who married a young girl? Exactly What's the age difference? About 3O years. 30? Unbelievable! I envy him. When I look at my wire, I think she's going to die before me. How can a faithful husband say something like that? Oh, that's just my dream. Wouldn't you want to sleep with a girl like that? Wouldn't you? Come on... hurry up... Girls, would you like to go to Mount Hakodate? Anybody home? Come in. Fujino, it's you! Good afternoon. Is sensei at home'? He's out at the moment. But do come in. In that case... I was told he ordered ham from lvvashita. Give him salted fish offal from me. Thank you very much. But the horse race is over, he should be back soon. - So sensei is at the horse tracK? - Yes. People are so unfair. Nobody seems to remember how he took care of me when I became an orphan. All they talk about is him marrying a young girl. I often talk to lvvashita. If there's any talk, there's very little. You're a kind man, Fujino. Ah... Sensei! But... I didn't know you were interested in horses. I used to ride horses myself... But now I try to work as much as possible. Business is business. And horse racing is horse racing. I knew horses named Patron and Hindustan. Recently new horses appeared. Tescoboy... Faberget... I know those. There are such horses? Nowadays, the best horses can't make it into the top six. I only bet on horses from the top six today But the top six kept losing. The top six? It's as if there was a different kind of racing at the race track. Chéji... vvhere are you'? Chéji! Help! There, lvvashita and lnoue... It's terrible... Stop it! Don't even dream about it! I told you I don't want to hear your stupid voice anymore. Inoue! Think about your wife and children. Everyone says that the shipyard owner lnoue spends his life in a karaoke bar. Ivvashita! Where do you fuck around? Where'? In a rented flat. The shipyard foreman saw everything. Ivvashita, stop! Ei! Why does everyone says you're avoiding them? Because... Why 'because? The foreman... the workers... everybody! Wake up! Eiji, everything is ruined... You come here... lvvashita, stop it! Enough! Stop! What happened? He's bleeding! Bring a towel, quick! Bring a towel! Ivvashita, sit down. Ei, I'm sorry What happened? I've been to the city council. Inoue is organizing an action. He wants to throw out the guys from YMA. That bastard doesn't care about human feelings. All he thinks about is his singing. I'll get on a passing train... You motherfucker! Hold still, please. Bastard. He's out of his mind. What should we do now? Don't worry I'll pay for everything. You bet. It's not enough. Call a cab and take him home. - Will you take him away? - Shut up! I'll kick his ass. I'll take him home. Chéji, you saved the day as always. This time it's different. We're here, lnoue. This way... This way Careful. Alright? Be careful there. I'm fine. Come inside. Great, isn't it'? I collected all this. It wasn't easy When I sing, I change my outfit and become a different person. Let's go downstairs. Well? I'm coming. I had an audio system installed here. At first, I didn't have one. Chéji, let's go to the hall and l'll tell you everything. This way Come. Chéji... Come and sit in the center There's sake there. Help yourself and relax. I'm ready to walk a hundred or even a thousand ri... If I can't do it... It means I'm worthless The boundless world has shrunk Where? Where will I go tomorrow? I'm coming to you. Ei, I'm sorry It's myfault. - Here. - What is it'? Accept it as my apology There's no need... I lost my temper. Let's have a drink... And where's Shigeko'? She went home. There were no customers. That's enough. How is he'? He kept singing all night. I see... Maybe vve should take him to the doctor'? And Sayo... probably too. Chéji! Hello... Who is it? When and how will I die? Harishu and Tsuru were killed... Now it's my turn. I'm like a broken lute. No matter how much you mend it, it doesn't sound the same anymore. I want saké! Bring me saké! Ei! I got one! Well done, lvvashita! Go catch some too. Ei, are you all right there'? I'm doing just fine. Do you want to climb even higher'? Tired? On the contrary I feel great. Ei, you didn't catch anything last time either... During school holidays? I remember I had to stay in the kitchen then. It was terrible. Even then, you were the same. Well, time to fry fish. Let's get shitfaced. We're having a good time, you and l, like in the old days. You can go down to the tent and relax there. I'm going to walk up here a bit more. Alright. Not safe, a bear might come here. Move it! I did catch a good one, after all. Well, you won't understand. Let's eat. I like masu. Ei, I'd like to talk about that relocation. Alright. Let's talk to Matsukavva. There's a problem now with that place Kavvahara found. You didn't vvant to poach somebody else's customers. You declined Kavvaharafs offer without explanation. - Do you want me to settle it'? - No, l'll deal with it myself. It's not easy to find land and a building for a cheap joint, though. Drunkards stay until late at night. Besides, it smells bad. Kavvahara sometimes flies into a rage when he's drunk. But he's not a bad person. Muster up your courage, Ei. And think about your own profit. - Yoshiji.. - What'? It's... very nice of you to come to my snack bar. Thank you so much. When I had that injury I came to you... and you immediately... All I did was talk to you once. Thank you for everything. What are you talking about, you strange man? You're a fool, Eiji. Eat up your masu. It's good that I was raised by a butcher. It's good that I'm a henpecked husband. I'm really lucky The food was great. And the drinks too. We had a great time! Let's dance! Is he really that sick? GM Yoshino has esophageal cancer. He's going to undergo an operation. And that's a long story so it's very unpleasant... for our company If the production stops, there will be layoffs. Fujino has a second chance now. He's a lucky guy But his character makes him unsuitable for the job. We're all trying our best. And he just quit. He did. If you like things like that, go upstairs. There's a special hall with underwear. And downstairs, there's a cabaret. What? A cabaret? Let's go dancing! What's wrong? Listen... About Eiji Fujino... Do you know him? I don't. Can I have more whisky? Waiter! Whisky with soda. Is that... the Fujino vvho has his ovvn place? You have beautiful eyes. Very beautiful eyes. Let's... Let's talk about Eiji Fujino. Please. You know what... Let's get married. I want to marry you. Please. I'm serious. We have a big age difference. I don't care. I'm not married. I am. Do you live separately? He's waiting for me to come back. We have two children. Do you want to go back? Maybe, you should break up'? He won't let me go. Sally! It's so hot today! I'm going to the marketplace. Do you need anything? No. Put the tofu in the fridge. Good afternoon. Come in! Nice to see you. Have a seat. Who is this young man? This is Kiriyama. Oh, it's you. I've heard a lot about you. Invite me for your next game. That'll make me very happy Excuse me. Kiriyama! What did I do'? I'll go get him. Kiriyama! I can't compete with a guy who runs regularly lg ive up. What is it'? What's wrong? They're not going to remove me from the team, right? My shoulders injured. Have you been to the doctor'? I've had pains for a long time. But now it hurts all the time. I've had treatment for a year now, with no results. Did you have a fever? I had a fever of 40°C. Did it hurt as well? Yes. And what if... you pitch with your left hand? With my left hand? Exactly If you keep training... you can gradually gain strength. My grandmother bought a left-handed glove for me. Without telling my mother. With that glove... I could throw with twice the same force. You can buy yourself one too. I still have mine at home. And what then? Then you'll start training and gradually regain confidence. I learnt to throw well with my left hand. As far as 37 meters. But I didn't manage to become a part of the university team. So I had to give up baseball. Baseball is not everything in life. Still... it's too early for you to give up. - Hello! - Come in. I was told the school headmaster was here. Are you the headmaster? Nice to meet you. My name is Mineko Wakakusa. You have to come to my place and have a drink with me. Not today I was invited to a homecoming. And Fujis place has a good reputation in the area. I was just walking by. Is that for your wife? I heard your wife is very young. Sensei... What is it'? Well? Forgive me for this question, but... Sensei, can you still do it'? Ivvashita, you're an idiot! No, really I'm curious. The same thing awaits all of us. So, is it yes or no? Can you still do it'? Cut it out! I'll answer. Fujino, lvvashita... and Akimoto, you can listen! But Shigeko will have to shut her ears. Why? I also want to listen. For breakfast, I eat a piece of toast with black tea... and boiled eggs with fruit. I've been doing it since before my wife was even born. You don't drink vegetable juice? You were listening! I was curious. Sometimes, I eat fresh vegetables instead of fruit. But black tea, a toast and boiled eggs are a must. It's very sensible. And healthy I always have... three boiled eggs. Do you know... what it does? It means once or twice a month. You deserve a reward. Well done, sensei! Stop shouting. I'll send you some steaks for that. I got great meat this morning. You can have breakfast with your wife and get some energy Eggs and eel is good. But there's nothing better than a steak. Right, sensei? Right, Ei? Fujino, lvvashita and Akimoto... My wife and I... we never talk about boiled eggs for breakfast. I don't know if it's good or bad. But it's a fact. Having a young wife... is not like what people think it is. People are mean. It's sad. On top of Mount Hakodate... Welcome home, dad! What is that? Go back to sleep. Why are you lying here in the dark? My head... You have a headache. No wonder. If you're feeling unwell, then spread a futon and take a nap. I'm hot! Hang on... Here's a fan. Here you go. I'll put it beside you. Damn neuralgia... Dad, did you buy a glove for me'? Sorry l forgot. I'll buy it tomorrow. It turns out... a young wife is a lot of trouble. Now I know... that there's nothing better than an old wife. My head... What is it, Suzuko'? What's wrong? Do you feel bad'? No! Mum is unwell! Call an ambulance! Quick, call 110... no, 119... or 190... Thank you so much. Have a seat here. The altar is really beautiful. You think so? I'm glad. There was a discount on it. But it was still the most expensive one in the store. Still, spending money on the altar was like giving it to my wife. She would be pleased. However, if she was alive... I'd spend everything on horses, as usual. Akimoto, do you play baseball? The bat... Oh, that. No... I just can't sleep without it. It's just that... a long time ago, when we got married... we had only one futon for two. And I got so used to sleeping like that... that I can't fall asleep without touching my wife's feet. So... for want of anything better... I borrowed my son's bat. I put it in my futon when I go to sleep. But it's made of metal. It's so cold... that it's hard to fall asleep. A fan, you say? That's completely wrong. They say you mustn't put a fan... beside a sick person. Even a healthy person can die like that. Not to mention someone who has heart problems. It causes lack of oxygen. And that's bad. Hey Chéji! Did you know that he borrowed money from me to buy that altar? His company Akimoto-taxi is my competitor. - Saké, please. - Coming right up. So I shouldn't have lent him money But I was touched by his grief. He wanted to buy an altar, after all. He wants to keep it until the next anniversary Guy likes to show off. When a person like that borrows from you, it can become a problem. You won't get your money back easily You'll have to chase him. How much'? Just a moment. 1,300 yen. Putting a fan next to a sick person... is no good. It's no way to save someone. It's a very stupid thing to do. Kavvahara! Can I talk to you'? It's not for long. What is it'? I wanted to ask you for something. I paid the bill. Yes, I know. And do you know... that I went to a lot of trouble to find a place for your joint? I'm sorry But I wanted to ask you for a favor. Do you want me to tell your fortune'? No. Just... don't say such things anymore. What things? About the fan. Oh that. About lack of oxygen'? Yes. Look at you! Are you going to teach me a lesson? No. It's just that... rumors might start circulating, and that can hurt Akimoto. Poor thing... What if it was your wife? Kavvahara! It's none of your business! Didn't you get enough last time? Kavvahara! You haven't been to Akimoto's place. There's no lack of oxygen there. Even with windows closed, there's always a draught. It's a ramshackle house. I talked to a doctor. He confirmed... that fans are dangerous. The fact that his house is ramshackle has nothing to do with it. What? Get out. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused. I just called the hospital. Kavvahara has a ruptured spleen. It's a serious injury but not live-threatening. Fujino, give me your hands. These hands shouldn't beat anyone. You were a great baseball player. These hands should have made our dream come true at the stadium. You embody... our youth. By the way Fujino... do you know a woman named Sayo Kamiya'? We were childhood friends. That's all? Yes. We're looking for her. Do you know where she is'? No. Yet there's a person who says you do. You really don't know where Sayo Kamiya is'? It might be more important than the accidental injury you inflicted. You had an affair with Sayo Kamiya. We've known about it for a long time. Why didn't you get married? You were close, but she rejected you'? Why did she decide to marry Kiutaro Kamiya'? We loved each other. But we were both broke. And since we loved each other... vve decided that this way at least one of us will be happy The Kamiya family is well-known. It's strange hearing such things from you. Strange? Today... it also sounds strange to me. But at that time... we desperately wanted a happy life. Exactly First, one of the two marries a rich person. And if that person dies... they get all the money Kiutaro Kamiya had TB. At that time, it was the same as having cancer today Both of you knew it very well. You're wrong. That's not what happened. I had only Sayo's happiness in mind. But Kiutaro didn't die. Sayo kept running away and returning. Finally she couldn't bear it anymore and left for good. Kiutaro didn't want to let Sayo go. It's obvious. You're wrong. So before leaving... she set the house on fire. Sayo isn't like that. That's exactly what happened. So far, everything confirms that. So... am I right, Fujino? Did you and Sayo... plot to burn down the Tamiya farm? If Kiutaro had died in that fire... your plan would have come true. After the police started looking for Sayo... you met with her. Didn't you? At Matsukavvafs... a witness heard you talk on the phone with Sayo. Start talking, Fujino! Alright. The fact that you refuse to talk says everything. It means I have nothing to hide. Looks like you'll have to spend winter here. Did you sleep well? Yes. It seems you got used to the cell during these five days. It's just What is it'? I just worry if the ragout will be cooked properly without me. I see. Let's begin. If you're so worried about your ragout... then answer my questions. Did you see Kamiya after the fire? Did you? Bye baby... Little squirrel from the Sleep Mountain... Takes away your tears and brings you dreams And brings you dreams Everyone's asleep Only shadows are walking in the moonlight Where are you now, Sayo? Are you waiting for me to find you? I met Sayo... ONCE. The ragout vvorked out well. I cooked it all the time during these six days. Give it to me. Why did you have to get drunk like that? If you keep drinking whisky like water, you can die! I don't mind dying. Sally let's get married. Give up this life. King Kong... What? A long time ago... we watched King Kong together. He was caught and put in a cage... and then paraded around. They put a fake crown on his head. Exactly like me. King Kong doesn't care... about the past... or about the future... Give it back to me! No! Give it back! No! I said give it back! No... There's someone you can't forget. And it's not your husband. Who is this man? Who is he'? Leave me alone! Leave me alone... It's crystal clear. Don't you see'? A customer came here, got drunk... started misbehaving and got the shit beaten out of him. He got what he deserved. Ivvashita! It's all right! One conviction is nothing for an owner of a joint. One has to defend one's dignity A conviction? Are you going to be sent to jail? He's going to get a suspended sentence. But it's still a conviction. No matter hovv many convictions you have... if you have a wife, it's not a problem. My wife knew how to pick mushrooms. At this time of the year, we used to go to the mountains together. Akimoto, what are you talking about? What does it have to do with Chéji? Ivvashita! Akimoto! Has Sanko-taxi relocated? No, it's Kavvahara... Now I owe him nothing for the altar. It's just that... Instead, he asked to hire my staff, so I agreed. Still, Kavvahara is Kavvahara. Thank you, Chéji... Well, l gotta go. l have to get up early tomorrow. Here, take the money Thank you. I'll go to sleep with my bat now. - What's gotten into you? - Don't do that anymore. I was just kidding. Don't get mad. Here's your change. A bat will do as well. Except it's cold in autumn. - You have a customer! - Welcome. I heard you opened your own place. So I decided to leave work earlier. Is it free here'? Muraki, it's you! Long time no see. I've been to the clinic in Sapporo... to see ourGM. What happened to him? He had a cancer surgery But, apparently it didn't help. Ei, don't be sad. Besides, he was the one who fired you. It became a turning point in my life. And it worked out for the better. My bitterness led me to opening this bar. If I was still working for the company... My life wouldn't be any better. Of course, you're your own man here. Yes. I wouldn't have made... a good head of department in that demanding job. And I think he knew that. What are you talking about? Have you forgotten how mad you were then'? I haven't. But it was stupid of me. I wish only the best for him. Still... what happened was unfair. That's what I think now. Him being sick... is more fair than if it were you. It's good that it's Yoshino and not lvvashita. But when I think about that, it makes me sad. Ei, forget about it! Exactly! Forget about it! Personally I forgot about everything. What were you talking about? Nevermind. Keep sleeping. I wasn't sleeping. I'm here to celebrate Chéji release. Pour me some more saké. Still... the police suspect Sayo. Sayo? However hard they try they can't find her. Ah, yes... Sayo... I was going to tell Chéji about it. About Sayo... A little while ago, a girl who worked for me... She's in Sapporo novv, by the vvay Anyway she saw Mrs. Kamiya in Susuki. Susuki? That's right. You think it was Sayo? I don't know. Someone's been calling at night lately Eiji. Hello? They hung up The picture was too small. This is all we managed. It's enough. Here. Eiji... Excuse me... Have you seen this woman? - She might be working as a waiter... - No, I haven't seen her. Hey do you know her'? Have you seen this woman? For Kozo Yoshino, yard 1510? That's right. Alright. Goodbye. Wait! Who is it from'? Tell him it's from a person who he did a favor for long ago. Chéji! Please, don't tell Yoshino. I wanted to express my feelings. I felt I had to do it in order to settle things. I wasn't aware. I come every day and see his condition. Fujino... Your full name is Eiji Fujino, isn't it? Yes. Do you know a women from cabaret Susuki named Sally? Sally? So you don't know Sally? Ochi, what's your relation to this woman? I proposed to her. I wanted her to marry me. Frankly speaking, l behaved like a child that night. I spent the night at her place. Don't laugh, but... It was my first time. I was so hurt. I almost lost my mind. I felt she was the one. I can't work now. And what did she say'? That she had a husband and two children. He's not going to give her a divorce. Is this her? It's Sally! So you do know her'? Who is she? Where is she from and who's her husband? Can I first talk to her? Where does she live? Sayo! Sayo! Police? My name is Fujino. I found Sayo Kamiya. Chéji! What's going on? They have such ceremonies in the village. The deceased lived on the Kamiya farm, didn't she'? And they didn't arrange a hearse? No. Guys from YMA decided to carry the casket themselves. Really? And what do you have there'? I have a bag with snacks. And I can sing afterwards. It's not a picnic. She died quietly so we should say a loud goodbye to her. Do I sing worse than YMA? Bye baby... Little squirrel from the Sleep Mountain... Takes away your tears and brings you dreams And brings you dreams Everyone wants you to say a few words. Everyone else has spoken. And lvvashita got drunk. Come on, such a handsome man has to have a drink with us. Let's have a drink. And then we can sing. You're still crying? Here, drink this. It'll make you feel better. Come on... Wakakusa! Can I have a drink too? Of course. You have to have a drink, Kamiya. You think so'? I've had a lot to eat and drink already I know. Drink some more. - Mum! - I'm here. Come! Saké is all we have left. It was saké that killed her. She died of bleeding from esophageal varices. How she must have suffered if she drank so much... I'm sorry for all the noise. I don't mind. My mother didn't come today She was so embarrassed for her daughter-in-law that she became ill. Chéji! You're suffering more than anyone else. I'm always glad to see you. Accept my condolences. She was a strange woman. But I'm happy I met her. She wasn't strange at all! Our great Hakodate, Otaru and Tomakomai... Hakodate, Otaru and Tomakomai... Forgive me. For what? Well... For that accident with Kavvahara... and for other things... For Sayo? No one can take away what a person carries in their heart. You can't wake a person who walks in their sleep. L--- was afraid that you'd leave me too. I was jealous. I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave the bar. Many people come here to eat. Besides, I have Michiko and Sachiko... And a wife who cooks dinner and waits for you. I don't regret marrying a bar owner. I'll make rice with mushrooms. To you! Cheers! A forgotten street... And an old-fashioned bar Many tired men... Will come here again tonight... To find shelter from the cold wind Men in business suits Where else... can you feel like you do here? I'll never come here again I'm tired of this city My woman has left me Where is she now? What man is beside her? I didn't know a dream could be so bitter But I keep looking for her Directed by Yasuo Furuhata
