- After my divorce... - Have you become a conservative? - No. - I was a part of... - Everything I said about taxes... - Like one body, one breathe, one heart. - Does the money go to the right place? - If that's what you think then... Should we invest in the libraries? Where's the money going to come from? - Do you know who came? Klas Ostergren. - No, is that true? Yes, may she live Yes, may she live Yes, may she live to be a hundred Yes, she will live Yes, she will live Yes, she will live to be a hundred years old Happy birthday to Lena! Forty years old and still horny like a teenager! - But Rabbe! - May she live! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! - And now you have to blow! - And now she should be raised! - Jesus! What are you guys thinking? - Oh no! Oh no! - Congratulations! - Thanks, darlings! - Bobo! Wait! Are you leaving? - Yeah, I'm going to my room. No, you're so boring! Stay. It's so fun when you're with us. You're so cute, little lady. Isn't she? My daughter cut her own hair! - This haircut fits you. - Lena... - It reveals your face. - Yeah, it's beautiful! Let her go. Goodbye lady! My mom is the worst. No parent is as bad as she is. She showed me off to everyone. She told everyone how beautiful my haircut was. - My parents are crazy. - No, they are at least nice. - They are not nice at all! - She ruins everything. She's embarrassing! Listen to them, you'll see that they are not at all nice. - It's not fair that I have to go. - Orjan, you booked the time. Yes, but that doesn't mean that I'll also do the laundry! - You booked it. I've got other stuff to do. - You're not doing anything. - I have booked.. - What is that? - What are you doing? - I'm letting Bobo listen to you. - Hello Bobo! This is how we have it. I booked, but I don't need to do the laundry! I don't get any big ones. Listen. “When you burn coal and oil you get carbon...” So gross! What do you have in your hair? Is it egg? - No, it's soap. - Soap? That's really dangerous. - You can get fungus! - Can you know knock it off. - It's true. - Stop it. It's not funny! I don't get it. Punk is dead, have you not figured that out yet? - It's not dead. - My brother was a punk until it died. - You look like a real punk. - You could be super cute. If you just stopped looking like that. - Be quiet. - She doesn't even have a real punk haircut. - What are you doing. This is important. - Yes, but I've had enough. - You've got a punk haircut, not her. - How did you end up being best friends? Quiet! Nuclear power is a really fucking important topic! It is scientifically proved that core meltdowns will happen. Do you know how you die from it? - No, we don't care. - The skin becomes black and falls off. - Where are we going? - Just away! Take the damn things! Damn retard kids! You should die damnit! - Now I'm coming damnit! - Stop it! What are we gonna do? This is so boring! Can't we go home to your place? - No, let's go to your place instead. - Not to my place, forget it! - We are going to your place! - No, Let's go to the community center and finish our world. Come on! Let's go! He's pretty good looking. Why would he do something like that? But... Shit! Stop throwing! We were gonna bake, not throw dough! Anders! There'll be no more table tennis this week. We have rules! There must be woodchip everywhere. These are dead houses. Look. Half has burnt down. Everything is exploding! Everything dies. That's a rotten head. He's black, skin is falling off. - A lot of blood... - More. Everything has to be destroyed. - She vomits! - Let's burn it down. - Aah, that's fast! - So gross! Check it out... - It's burning! - And she dies. - Aah! Ouch! - World War 3. Guys, check this out! - Shit, best looking girls in town! - Best looking girls! - I'm getting so horny! - Damn, you're ugly. What a hell? - Aah my head! - I cannot accept this! No! Please, ask them to turn it down. People are getting headaches from this. No, I have a lot to do. There's been a lot of food fighting. - That's not our fault. - No, but I'm the one who has to clean it up. - They can at least lower it! - There's a list back there. You put yourself down on the list- -and then you get the right to play in that space. If they can't lower it, then we also want to play. Now. - You also want to play? - We also have a band! - You have a band? - Yes. - That's great! For long have you been playing? - A while. We want to play there now. Wednesday... - Seven a clock... - Shit! It's free! - They forgot to to sign up. - It's empty so we're taking it. - They just must have forgotten. It's Wednesday after seven. So we can take it. - But they're playing. - If they forgot to sign up, then... - Rules are rules! - Roger! - Yes? - We've got a little... - You must get your friend? - Iron Fist hasn't signed up. They forgot so we're taking that time. That's our right! Rights. We can play as loud as... I agree. If you have signed up then the space is yours. - You haven't signed up. - That stupid list! - Have they signed up? - Yes, in an empty square. - This is our rehearsal time! - I'm sorry. - We've been playing every Wednesday for three years! - The list is there to avoid chaos. - There's a pen hanging... - Fuck them! Let's go! - Quiet! Come on now, let them. - Seriously! - Let them try it out. - They're stealing our rehearsal time. - You haven't signed up. - We're rehearsing now! - You guys are fucking dead! - No, no, no, no one is dying here! - Fucking cunts. - Watch your language, show that you're adults. - Do you even have instruments? - There's no instruments here? - You can't borrow ours. - We had a guitar but it broke. - But we have a bass and the drums. - Good. We play bass and drums. Okay, good... It's all yours, girls. - You're dead! Understand? - Stop it. No such... Democracy! You don't have to hook up the drums, do you? How does someone do this? The best looking girls in town! - Boo! - Ah shit, come on, let's go. Hello! Mom? Mom? Hey Bobo! I'm spending the night at Lasse's. There's fishsticks in the freezer. Hugs and kisses! Mom. - How's it going? Catching anything? - No, You're going to trick the fish? Make them think there's something to eat. - What have you got the the hook? - Worms. - Did you put on the worm yourself? - Yes, it was wrapping around my fingers. Does your ears ring? Mine too. What if we are ruining our hearing? No. It's actually a good thing. - It means that you have good hearing. - Are you sure about that? - It's proven. - Do you want to have a real band? Yes! It was so fun to play. Then I want to play bass. - I want to play bass too. - But you were so fucking good at the drums! - You think? - Yes, damn good! - But seriously, like a band? - Yes, seriously. For real. -Hej. -Hej. - Weren't you spending the night at Lasse's? - No, it didn't end up being so. Are you sad? It's over with Lasse. Oh... Can I do anything for you? You want tea? Hot chocolate? No, I'm okay, thanks. You're so kind. Have you eaten anything? It's really important to eat. Otherwise your body gets tired and you get sad. - I ate earlier. It's not a problem. - Do you want an aspirin? - Can you get the phone for me? - The phone? Then we had sex, it felt good, but then afterwards... Come on now! Swap! Red, swap! Red swap three players right now. Come on! Get up now. You have to play, not just sit there. Can someone swap here? You, come! - Go. Come on! Work! Be aware of your teammates. - Come on, do something! - Good! - Nice! - You passed to the other team! - Are you stupid? - Why does it matter? He had a red band. Did you not see that? Why does it matter? It's just a ball. - There are rules! Take it seriously. - Can't you just go and die? - How am I supposed to know what team he's on? - He has a red band! You're not taking it seriously. Jog ten laps around the gym. Go! - There are more important things in the world. - Continue playing! You jog. - Fuck off! - Yes! Goodbye! This can be a song. “What does it matter, it's just a ball.” - You're not jogging. - Fucking great. Come up with more. -“The children in Africa are dying...” - Come on! “Nature has been filled with poison, but you only care about your ski lift.” “Children are starving every day, but you only care about your football team.” - That's not jogging. - Football team, shit that's good! Lair, bear, snare, square. There's war on a square and all you do is look at is my lair. We'll submit our song to the Fall Concert. - That's just in a few days. - If you want it, you can make it. “This song is dedicated to our fantastic gym teacher" Hate sport, hate sport! Hate my team Our football team wins, the world burns. - Hate sport, make abortion, hate sport! - What do you mean, make abortion? - Like, abort the sport. - I didn't get that. That's what separates punk from commercial disco music, you have to think a bit. Disco music is... no! - Can I join you? - No, leave! - We can play a little, come on.. - We're doing a really important thing. - Leave, you're embarrassing! - I can contribute. Come on! No, what are you doing? Stop it! - Sing! - Hate sport! - That swings real good! - Hate sport! - You're so fucking good, Bobo! - Yeah, sure! Leave! Hello! Leave! Stop it! - No! Tell him, this isn't funny! - Kalle, we can have our own orchestra. Yes! Leave! Hate parents! Hate parents! Abort all parents! - Lena. - Bobo. Bobo? But.. hello little lady. I thought you were in bed sleeping. - Where are you? - At Klara's. I'm so sorry, I thought you were home. Little girl! Eh, I was going to say that we aren't quite done with our homework yet here. And so I thought I'd ask if I can sleep here tonight. At Klara's? Yeah... Yes, but will you get up in time tomorrow then? - Toilet? - In the hallway. - Who's there? - A friend. - Lasse? - No, a friend. - Have you done all your homework? - No, that's why I'm sleeping here. Ah that's right! Sorry, so confused, then I know that you're sleeping over at Klara's. That works great. Sleep tight. Big kiss. See you tomorrow. Goodbye! - She's got a new guy again. - Good for her. - God, my haircut is so fucking ugly. - I think it's really nice. - I don't look like a punk. - Yes! No. I look more like a troll or something. A troll? You don't. I think you look really nice. - You want to have the same haircut then? - Like a mohawk. - I can cut you a mohawk. - Not like you, I mean... - You're perfect. - Do you have to brush your teeth now? Quiet, Klara. - You're perfect. You have great hair. You should be yourself. But if you want to I can show you how to make it stand up. - She's going to have a mohawk. - No, she's not! - Do you want that? Then you can take a little soap... and then... - Oh, God! - Your haircut is a boring cliché. She should be unique. You can make screws that stand up. You can make some all over your hair. If you do like this, it becomes like spikes. Like this. You kind of screw... Do you think this will be nice? HI! My name is Bobo and I hate my haircut. So I get help from Klara's idiot big brother. Why are you so rude towards him? He's nice. Linus? Nice? Towards you, yeah. Not to me. He betrayed punk. Listens to Joy Division. - That's not that bad. - He knew Mongo in Incest Brothers. So now he can't just think punk is shit. When he knew him. If he did... This is going to be great. We're in a hurry so we have to speed it up a bit. Hello. We've written a song and wonder if we maybe can join in? - It's too late. The program is full. - It's about our gym teacher! - Yeah but that's how it is. - What shall we do then? Come back next year, that's my advice. - Idiot... - Okay, is everyone ready? Screw the Fall Concert. They are lame. - I wish that everything died in a fire. - We are too good to play there anyways. If we can't play the Fall Concert then I don't want a band anymore. In KP there is an interview with the three guys in the band Sabotage. “It's not true to say that punk's dead, says Mackan" "Disco music is tiresome and commercial crap, says Elis." - That's how it is. We must fight too. - I don't want a band! - We don't get to play the Fall Concert. - Screw that! We're too good for it. - We can't even play. - Yes we can! None of us can play. I'm falling sleep. I can't watch! La, la, la... Shit this is bad! One, two, three. Three balls and one cork, and three empty cups - So damn boring! - Says you. One here. And I'm not cheating, there is actually one under this as well. But this has three and that has two. Prelude in d-minor by Sylvius Leopold Weiss. Every damn year! - Strip down! Strip down! Strip down! - Quiet now! I don't get how she has the energy to perform when everyone is booing. She's actually pretty good though. Too bad she plays such crap. - Strip down! - Yes, strip down! - Know what Klara, I have any idea. - What's that? How can you think that? She's so Christian! - Someone has to teach us. - I can play on my own! We'll try to affect her so she's not so Christian anymore. Affect? Get her to think a little more freely, little differently. Like us. - Would she? - Yes. Yeah, that makes sense. That's what punk is about. That you... ...affect people. Like when we sing about hating sports. Then we want to affect people, so that they hate sports like we do. Yes, and it's political that we spend time with people who are having a hard time. She doesn't have a lot of friends. She always sits alone in the canteen. It's actually very political to stand with the weak. If she doesn't stop being Christian, we'll kick her out. - What should I say? - Don't know. - Come on. - No. - Hi! Are these free? - Yeah, Cool! - You were so good at the Fall Concert! - You were great! - Thanks! - Eh, you're welcome. - Quiet! - Come on, quiet! We just thought that you were so great and the idiots that screamed- -are so wrong. You were super great. We're on your side, you should know that. But we thought we'd tell you that... we have a band. You're so damn good, so we thought to ask if you'd want to play with us. We haven't been playing for very long. Like, we need a little help. Do you want to join? Is this a joke? - It's not a joke. - You're serious? It could be a lot of fun! Please, you must. There's no choice. Such is faith. We thought that you could show us some easy stuff. - We have our own song. - I want to listen to another song. - Chords? - Yes, exactly. - I'll listen. - Do you have a melody for the song? - Not quite finished. - I mean, I can show you how to play... - Listen here, this is very good. - What song is this? - An Ebba Gron song. - Why? - Is this your song? - No. - It's not the song I'm teaching you? - What song is it? - It's "Hang God." It's very good. - Bobo, knock it off! We're not going to listen to it. That's mine. This is unnecessary. - Wasn't it great? - Give it to me! It's mine! I'm telling you, don't pull it out! - It's mine. See what you're doing... - Wasn't it great! - What was that song? -"Hang God”. It's about hanging God because he's a fascist. - But it's actually a Christian song. - Are we doing our song or not? If you sing about how you want to hang God, then God must exist- -then you believe in God. Therefore it's a Christian song. - Let's do our own song instead. - Do you have a melodi? We play... the same, but... Hate sport Hate, hate, hate sport People die every day, you only care about your high jump team In Africa children are starving, you only care about your football field Hate sport! Yeah! - What do you think? Wasn't it great? - Yes. I don't like sports either. No, but like, did you think, it was good? You sing like... You play different notes than the ones you're singing. It's better if you... Like, it sounds like this... - Damn, that's good! - Hate sport! - Hate sport... - One, two, three, four. One, two, three. Oh. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Good! - Much better! Hate sport, hate sport Hate, hate, hate sport - Oh! - Good! It sounds damn good! - Shit, that's good. - One, two, three, four: Hate sport Hate, hate, hate, sport Hate, hate sport! What's a chord? Imagine playing a lot of notes at the same time. - And it sounds like this, it chimes... - What a hell is that? It's probably garbage. It'd be gross to open it! - What is it? Is it worth money? - Is it yarn? - It's a bunch of yarn! - You can't take it. Who leaves two trash bags on the street? They've been here for a long time! We can take them. We can use it for something. Help me. We can sell it. It's heavy. - It's all wet! - Let's put them back. God! Dragoneggs, or something. Break them. - What can we do with them? - Hot dog. - With ketchip. - Yellow mustard. It's a bit too long. Anyone hungry? - Everyone must die! - The brain is falling out. Kill them! Ow! Ow, ow... - It's okay, can I look? - It's bleeding a lot! - Breathe! - What should I do?! - I don't want to die! - Relax! - Let's rinse it. - It hurts! Should I call for an ambulance? You'll get tetanus! - You have to take a shot. - No! - Do you want to die? - No! It's going to hurt a lot! - You just have to put on some bandage. - It hurts! - It's not bad. - Bobo, we're just going to get the blood off. - It's going to be fine. - I'm going to die. - There. - Ow! Ow, ow... It hurts. I don't want to die. - Hey. - Oh hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to see you - Likewise. - Shall we? - Yes. - And here I am with the chicken. - Oh here we have chicken. - Bobo, did you wash your hands? - No. Then do that. - It looks great. - How fun. - It's a conference. - Ah, okay. It's mostly about the 19th century, so it's all new research. - I'm going to Klara's now. - Now? - Yeah, we're gonna do homework. - But we're having dinner with dad. We're gonna study for a math test on Monday. - But it's Friday. - It's a lot. She's helping me. - Is Klara a classmate? - Yes, we're in the same class. - Dad can help you. - But Klara and I are supposed to. - I promised I'd come. - Maybe Klara can come here? - She can have some meringue pie! - She's waiting for me now. She's also watching her little brother, her parents are away. But you're here now. How often do you see each other? We're making meringue pie and eating it together. - If she promised... - It's not often that dad is here. - Don't do it for me. - We can see each other tomorrow. No. Are we supposed to make meringue pie on our own? - Stop with the meringue pie. - I won't. Let's do this... - Let's eat it now. - Yes, now. And then you go to Klara's. Hey you, it's going to be tasty with meringue pie, right? Come, come. You have the tickets. Klara! Klara! Get out! Drink this so you chill out a bit. Your sister is very cute. Why is Klara here? - Such bad music. - Come, Klara. We're just cleaning. - One, two, three. - How disgusting! - Your braincells are dying. - Only if you mix it. - Wine, beer... - Wine and beer. It's only two things. You're not fully developed. Your braincells will be destroyed. - We're not mixing it. - What if social services comes? - Wait. Foam... - Children are not allowed to drink alcohol. What if your neighbor calls the police? This is illegal. - I'm leaving now - No, stay. - Shit, Bobo! Pick up the glass! - Yeah. We get it up like this... - We must dry. - Not that one! Okay, take this. Rub it down. - I'm leaving now. - No, don't go! Hedvig, wait! Hedvig please, stay a little longer. Only a little. We want to buy you a guitar. - We thought you were really boring. - Christian all the time. "God!" - But you're super nice. - That you'd be praying during lunch. No one got to hang out with you because you had to pray. No, stop! Let go! - Hedvig, taste it. - No, "Vino tinto Español. Wine- and sprites central." - Sit down! - It's not tasty, but it's good. Sit down, damnit. Bobo! - Cheers! - I'm leaving now. Goodbye. - But... Ah, you're so boring! - Hedvig... - Damn, such good music! Oh, oh... - Oh! - What a hell...? - You have really good taste in music. People should listen to all kinds of music. Klara only listens to punk. I think you should mix it up and not just listen to the same thing. Like, it becomes boring.. - Are you okay? - Why? Of course. - She seems a bit drunk. - Has Klara been drinking? No, we have not been drinking, unlike you who have been drinking wine and beer- -and have been smoking like crazy. There's so much smoke in here. - We're not twelve. - Neither am I. I'm thirteen. Maybe you should have a glass of water? - You've been drinking. - As have you! - Am I not allowed to sit here? - No. Come. What a hell? Klara, did you guys drink all of this? - Klara, wake up. - I'm awake. Mom and dad are going to kill us. What are you doing? Stop. Let them be. - I'm taking them, so you don't drink anymore. - Fucking conservative! - Don't come out one more time! - Fascist! - Bobo, you too. - Yes. - Don't come out one more time! - Fucking jerk cop. - He's so cute. - What? Who? Linus? Yeah. You have a crush on Linus? You can't have a crush on a 16-year old! — You can't have a crush on my brother! - A little maybe. So what? - He is 16, Bobo! - Yeah. - Bobo and Klara, leave! - Stop it! Let go! Bobo! - Klara, get a grip! Go down. - I don't want to. - Bobo, come. Dance! - Go to your room. Don't be here. - Take it easy! - No. - Shit, not my records! - Damnit. - Bobo? - Get a rag. - Are you okay, Bobo? - Klara, go! - Bobo, let's go to my room. - It's your fault, Klara. - No. - Bobo? - I'm never going to get a guy. - Of course you will. - Everyone thinks I'm ugly and gross. - They don't think that. - Yes, Linus does. - He doesn't think you're ugly and gross. - I threw up on his records. - He had them on the floor. Everyone thinks I'm a misfit. In grade school you were invited to all the parties and I was never. - That's not true at all. - It is true. - Just say one thing that's good about my life. - You play in the best band in the world. I guess maybe that. But nothing else. You have a friend who likes you. You have two friends who like you. That's all a person needs. - Kumbaya my Lord... - Stop! Stop! - Our band must play this. - Forget it! Okay. I'll play another. I lay at home in my bed on an ordinary day - It's “Six zero two”! - The best song in the world. Where did you learn this? The body screams for sleep, but the brain says no And I think that I will never meet someone like you Shaking my head around and enlarge my pupil You showed a place where one can do whatever they want - We will never be that good. - Yes. The police came and yelled and beat and spit on me. It was yesterday when I was standing around waiting for you Damn, we'll never get that good. I said: You're allowed to stand here. They said: Get lost, you pig. and I said: Why's that? So now I'm beaten black and blue on the outside and on the inside So please take me there where one can do whatever they want I saw you die this fall and I think I'm following with I'm only twenty-one and you were only twenty-three - That's all I know. - Very nice! - Damn, that's great! - I just wanted to cry. So great. - We'll never be as good as you. - Sure we will. - How long have you been playing? - Four years. - It takes a while to learn. - There's no way I can wait four years! - Wait, it's out of tune. - What do you mean, out of tune? - I don't hear a difference. - Let's go! Come on! Hate sport, hate sport Hate, hate, hate sport People die every day and all you care about is your high jump team In Africa children are starving and all you care about is the football field Hate sport, hate sport Hate, hate, hate sport You have a lot of money. You have to share it with people. - Without money you can't shop. - But we're hungry. - It doesn't work that way. - Come on! - You make a lot of money. - I'm not discussing this. - You won't get anything without money. - Just some french fries? - We're leaving. - I can help the next customer. - You must help the poor. - Are you a conservative, or? - Have you heard of solidarity? - French fries, please! - Take these and leave. - Thanks! Bye! - My little sister Johanna. - Klara Hi. Bobo. I'm leaving now. How nice of you to take care of Johanna. Sweet of you. - Bye, cutie. - Bye. Hedvig will take care of you tonight. Bye, sweetie. That's a really nice drawing. - Bye. Have a good time. - Have a good time at the theater. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. And don't forget to turn of the stow. Okay. Bye. - Damn, this was tasty! - Don't cuss, Klara. You're so sensitive! I don't get this whole God thing. How can you believe in something that you have never seen or met? - You can still believe... - There are things that you can't see. - Like what? - You can't see nuclear raditation. - Do you also believe in God? - No, but some things can't be seen. - You can't touch feelings. - Are you two against one now? - Johanna, do you also believe in God? - Mm. - But why? - Stop it. You're little. You're allowed to believe in God. But Bobo, you may never start believing in God! - That's not your decision. - Three against one. Bobo doesn't believe in God. - Then you would not be my best friend any longer. People are allowed to believe in what they want. What do you believe in? I don't believe in God. I believe in ketchup. It's the best thing there is. - That's a lot! - Oops... When we're finished with this, it'll be really... - Ruined? It can just be brushed out. - It's going to be so good! - Soap! I have soap in it now. - Or toothpaste. - No. - Let's try. - A little more here. Here. - Please, Check it out! Look! We have to spray it so it stays. Wait, wait! I just have to think. - It's going to be damn nice. - I don't know if mom... - Screw mom! - She won't mind will she? - The important thing is that you like it. - It's your hair. - Have your cut hair before? - Yes, my little brother. - You're going to look so great. - He was super pleased. Don't worry. You're going to look great. Hold my hand. - There! - Look! There it is. Here's the hair. That went great, you look so good. Goodbye, hair. - Now she's cut. - Shorter, And now we have to cut here, because you didn't have a razor. - What happened? Did you get scared? - You just touched my ear. - Be careful. - I didn't cut it off! - It's good. What do you think? - It's nice. - Do you really think so? - It takes a while to get used to. Remember that is grows back out. Do you really think that she was pleased? I think so, yeah, of course she was. It turned out really nice. We have to write one more song. We could have something that's about... ...rich and the poor somehow. You know what I mean? - Get out, we're doing something really important! - Now we're in big trouble. - Leave! - Hedvig's mom called.. - What has she done? - Kalle is allowed to hear this. She said that you forced a haircut on Hedvig. She's thinking about reporting you to the police. - Shit, shit, shit! Did she say that? - Yes. - Now you're in big trouble. - Why are you laughing? There's a little humor in it. You can't report someone to the police for a bad haircut. - Stop laughing! - You have to go there tomorrow. - Can't you do it? - It wasn't I who cut her daughter's hair. You have to go there and explain that that's how it's supposed to look, the hair. - What if she kills us? - You'll have to calm her down. Some tea. You're in seventh grade, right? Is that fun? Mm, it's fun. Thanks. - Sugar and milk? - No thanks. - Are you sure? - I'll take some milk. - Klara? - I'll also take some milk. There are some cookies and crackers here. Just take what you want. I was thinking that we'd do this: I am considering going to the police. But if we can come to an agreement now when we are sitting here it'd be better. - Am I right? - Mm. Well, I'd really like for you to start believing in God. For you to become Christians. Therefore you shall follow me to church every Sunday. A couple of upcoming Sundays. If you do that, then I don't report you to the police. - But you can't do that. - You can't force us to go there. No, you got that right. I can't force you. - Do you recognize this situation? - No. Isn't it a pretty uncomfortable situation? I think so too. - Does it remind you of something? - What do you mean? “If you don't cut your hair you can't be in the band.” “If you keep this nerdy haircut you can't be our friend.” - That's not how it was. - Sorry, it was dumb. - Is she really sad? - She didn't say no. There's a lot of ways to say no. The food is so damn gross. I don't want it. There's Hedvig! Why did she sit down over there? - Damn, what a fucking ugly beanie! - What... Hedvig, what are you doing here? You saw us! Why aren't you sitting with us? - You haven't had a single friend... - Klara! What? You have gotten to really great friends who you can be with all the time. We did you a favor! Now you can at least say hi to us? Sorry that we cut your hair, but we didn't fucking abuse you! We didn't have a knife. You'll have to learn to say no. - That's not the reason. - What? It's not that I am angry with you. I'm embarrassed for what my mom did. That's why I wasn't in school yesterday. I thought you were mad at me. Of course we're not mad at you. And your mom did the right thing. No, she was totally stupid. - You hair looks so great. - Klara... - You hair looks so great. - Give me the beanie. — Give me the beanie, Klara. - Nope. - It's really ugly. - Give it back! - You can wear the beanie then. - It's really nice. You get this entire lump of skin. Bobo, open wide! What are you going to be when you grow up Are you doing to be like mom and dad Are you going to be a boss, a seller or a leader somewhere Maybe you'll be happy with whatever shit job you can get You don't care at all Whatever happens, happens What are you gonna be Keep on being a rebel Keep on being yourself Keep on being a rebel Keep on being yourself Keep on being a rebel People are dying every day and you only care about your high jump team Wait! We can't sing high jump team They don't jump as a group. - Are there high jump teams? - Let's do basketball team. Yes! “You only care about your basketball team.” But hello! You can't hear Hedvig at all and not mine either. We have to get an electric guitar. Let's try with just Hedvig and I... Why don't I ever get to play? Why should you play the bass? You make all the decisions. I don't want to play the drums anymore. - I'm just showing. We'll play later. - Why can't you play the drums? - But you play the drums. - It's mean that I have to. - Then sing. - Why do you get to make all the decisions? - Then I get to play! - I'm taking the bass. Why? Why does she always get to play? - You play the drums. - Are you our mother? Bobo! Bobo, quiet! - I don't think so. - It's an electric guitar! - You can't beg. - Look sad. My friends and I have a band and we'd like to buy an electric guitar. Could you donate a little money? I don't have any cash right now. I lost my wallet and I can't get home. I got locked out of my house. Can I have some cash? Thank you very much. Yes! My dad is dead and my mom drinks a lot and I haven't had any food in weeks. - Do you have any coins left over? - You should be ashamed! - Two crowns. - Thank you very much! Thanks! - How much? - Pick them up! — Have you seen “A Respectable Life”? - No. — Have you seen “A Respectable Life”? - Yes. Stoffe is my dad. We look a lot like him. He's having a hard time and we lost our wallet- -so we can't get home to Hokarangen. We need money for an electric guitar. My mom is dead and hers drinks a lot... - Can't you work? - We don't have a job. But you can't stand here and beg. In this country you're not allowed to. - How much is it? - It's not enough. We can go and buy something really tasty instead. - We can save it and collect more. - We can beg some more. - I'm also a bit hungry. - We can buy some chocolate and caramels. Chocolate sauce and ice cream! - More sprinkles! - Take a lot. Nougaut - Let's dip the chips in the chocolate milk. - In this here? - What are you doing? - Chips and chocolate sauce. - Mm! - God, so tasty. And messy. - I never get this kind of stuff. - Me neither. - It's going to be like one big glass. - Here comes a truckload of chocolate sauce. “Disco music is commercial says Elis Liljegren, guitarist in Sabotage.” - Want David. - I already called dibs on him. You have? But you fit much better with Elis. - Bobo and Elis fit together. - I was gonna have him. And you were gonna have them. I fit much better with him. - He's pretty cute. - Bobo and Elis. David and Klara and Mackan and Hedvig. - I don't know... - We must call him. Liljegren... - Quiet, it's ringing! - What if it's him! Hi, my name is Bobo I'm looking for Elis Liljegren. - Telephone for you. - This is Elis. Hi, this is Klara. We must meet! We are also punks. This is faith. - Come on! - I'm going to fall! - Excuse us! - Hold on to me now! Wait! - Klara! Are you wearing make up? - Let's see. - No. - We said we weren't going to wear make up. - Is it for them? - No! We're supposed to be against make up. - I think that's them. - Man they are staring. - Hello - - Hello - Hi. What shall we do? I don't know. What do you think? - We can go to our practice space. - You have your own practice space? Yeah, in a basement. If you want to we can go there and play a little. - Aren't you three? - No, not anymore. - But you were three in KP. - Yes, but David, the other guy... He liked Noice, so we kicked him out. - They suck so bad! - And they can't even spell! "Noise" is spelled with an S, otherwise it's "no ice". No ice. We've swapped instruments, so that I am the one who plays drums now. - This is a nice suburb. - It's not a suburb, it' a town. Solna is a town. Yeah, it's own municipality. Ah, right. It really looks like a suburb. - Do you also like KSMB? - Yeah, they are better than Ebba Gron. Damn, it's so cold. - I also think KSMB is great. - Everyone thinks Thastrom is so good. - I know, he's totally overrated. - What a strange style you've got. You look like a prog rocker. Yeah, not the hair, but the scarf, for an example. - It's the opinions that are important. - Yeah. Are we in a forest? So fucking strange. - A hare! - There are so many. - Three. - In the suburbs. - We're just gonna get the key. - The practice space. - It's a shame that they are just two. - Yeah, a damn shame. - What do you think? - Klara is cute. - You think? - The girl you were talking to. He's so cute. Elis. - What do you think? - I don't know. Hedvig, maybe. - With the glasses? - No, that's Bobo. - This is your own practice space? - Yeah. You can sit there in the corner. If you can fit. - What song should we play? -"Brezjnev, Reagan". You can be here whenever you want to? So if you're having a sleepover you can come here during the night? - We sleep here sometimes. - Where? Here on the floor. - What are you doing for New Years? - New Years? It's long until then. - We are going to have a party. - At my place. - If you want to you can come. - Yeah, how fun! Can I have my drumsticks? Thanks. Brezjnev. Brezjnev and Reagan, fuck off! Cowboy without a hat B-actor-grin Bear, big and strong But don't touch mine We're building a barrier Canons and rifles East against west Who will arm up the best? Brezjnev and Reagan, fuck off!

Maybe a little. - Come on. Do you know “Mental Ice Age”? Mental, mental, mental ice age... - Look how close to the edge I can go. - Bobo, what a hell are you doing? - Step away! - Come back! - Okay! God... - What a hell are you doing? That's fucking dangerous! Bobo, let's go down. I'm freezing. Did you cut your own hair as well? It's almost nicer. - Hi- - Hi- - What are you guys doing? - We're just sitting and talking. Okay. God, I'm freezing. Bobo! - Are you angry? - No, they were just so boring. - They weren't that cute in real life. - You sure? - Good. - What do you mean, good? That you're not sad because of me and Elis and that you're not jealous because I... - No. - Good. They weren't cute. They looked like mall punks. - No they didn't. - How can you write such shitty lyrics? - What do you mean? - Brezjnev is dead. You can still say "fuck off". You're probably wonder why we gathered you here. We have two really good news. Kenneth and I have finally bought a brand new electric guitar for the practice space. Now the place is fully equipped. It is as close to a Strat as you can get. It's a real beauty. But then there is a community center in Vasteras as well- -that every year has a “Santa Rock” event in the days between Christmas and New Years. But now it' not going to be until January. And we have been invited to the “Santa Rock” And first we thought of you guys, Iron Fist. You are like made for this. You obviously are allowed to play. - To show the people from Vasteras... - ...that you can rock their asses off. - And then... - ...Kenneth and I have talked. We feel like it would be fun with a girl band as well. So we thought of you. - We're not a girl band. - We're not. - You are girls and you have a band. - A girl band. - You are. - We could have a guy in the band. Even if your music is not girlie, you're still a girl band. If not, what are you? A boy band? This i the new guitar, a Silver Star. - You're the one who plays guitar right? - Hedvig. Have you played before? I can teach you the basics, Hedvig. - Some chords and stuff. - We have a lot of experience. - Rogge has played with Rickfors. - No, with his bass player. But he's a professional musician today. We heard that damn sport song so we take that theme and improvise. - We can show you a little... - How to build a song. It's good to have an extra stick. We can make an extra hole in this here, so that it comes up a bit. - Setup everything right. - I'm going to teach you some simple chords. Here is E, A, G and D. There. - Do you feel that bit of swing? - One, Two. - One more time. - One, Two... I hate sport That damn sport It gives me such anxiety. That damn sport. - Okay. Do you want to try? - Come on! No. I have never played electric guitar. You've got to start sometime. Kenneth can show you good chords. We'll teach you how told hold it. It's not dangerous. It won't bite. - It's so heavy. - Yeah, it really is. - It's in tune. - It's not completely in tune, is it? - I tuned it earlier. - No problem, just go with it. You can do this, I promise. Just try it out. I lay at home in my bed on a regular day Around me there are thousands of people but right here there is only me My body screams for sleep but my brain says no I think about how I will never again meet someone like you I love snow! - Are you mad? - No. - Jump then! - Nah I'm freezig. You were so damn good today, you were so fucking good! “I don't think it is in tune.” And then you tuned it. So cool! - That was so funny! - Bobo, what is it? - I'm just freezing. - Are you still mad about Elis? - Why would I be that? - Well don't be. I don't like him. - Why not...? - I don't know. He never calls. - He doesn't? - It doesn't matter. Goodbye! Now I must hug you one more time. Bye! - Hello? - Hi, it's Bobo. I was wondering if Elis is there. - Elis, it someone named Baba. - Yes, hello? - Hi! It's Bobo. - Bobo? I was just wondering... You said you like KSMB. I was just listening to “Bakverk 80”. It's a bit rare. - Have you heard it? - No, I have it here at home. And I was wondering if you would like to borrow it fro me? - Yeah, I'd love to. - Should I come over with it tomorrow? You can borrow it. We can tape it. Damn, how cool. That was a good song. - What did you do to your hand? - I accidentally cut myself. Let me see. - It looks cool. - Thanks. - Are you ticklish? - No. - Do you want us to see each other again? - Yeah... yes... It's just... Klara. I'm just going to break up with Klara first. Mm. - Yeah... okay, bye. - Bye. Our time is brief, upon the earth, with troubles many and little mirth Hi, little Santas, fill your glasses and let's be jolly together - Hey! - Cheers. Merry Christmas! - Have you heard about her photography project? - I am taking pictures of asses. All sorts - adults, children, old people. It will be small pictures, of different types. I was doing feet before, remember that? - Can't we open our Christmas gifts? - Let them get them. Go. Yes, take the Christmas gifts. It's not such a big deal. - You can also take some gifts. - A teddybear. Pretty large too. - Does he fit? - Red looks good on you, sweetie. Thanks, it's nice. - A lego! - Merry Christmas. This is from me. It's culture. You kids have too much garbage, but this, this is real culture. - It's cheddar. - You're too funny. You must get something in contrast to all the other stuff. Johan, you also got one. By the ram there. I'll start. Whoever the bottle stops on has to kiss Janne. - You're kidding! - No, they have to kiss Janne. Are you guys ready? Kiss yourself! - Lilian. - Hi, my name is Bobo. - I was wondering if Elis is home. - Yes he, hold on a little. - Hello? I can't find him. - Oh really... So, he's not at home? It doesn't seem like it. I'm sorry, I don't really know where he went. But can you then wish him a Merry Christmas from me? - Have you talked to Elis? - What do you mean? You said that he hadn't called. - No. - Has he still not called? But do you think you're still dating then? I don't know. But I think I have a crush on him again. What? What do you mean you have a crush on him again? I don't know! Maybe, maybe not. But you told me that you didn't like him anymore. What does it matter? Like I said, we'll see on New Years. - On New Years? - At the party. - What party? - Elis and Mackan are having a party. Oh damn that's right. I don't think we should go. It doesn't feel like we're invited. - Of course we are. - But you don't want Elis anymore. - Have you not talked to Elis? - Come on! Have you got a better suggestion? If it's boring we'll just go home. One... nine... Hello? Hi, is Elis there? It's Klara. What? Hello? Hello? - Hello! Fuck, it got cut off or something. - Hold on. First it was Elis then it was some girl. There was a party at least. - Let's go home. I'm freezing. - Let's try. Come, let's go. - Can't we take the subway home? - No, we have gotten this far. - But listen... - Come on Bobo! It's the other way. Now we're just walking for no reason. - It's dark, cold and raining. - It's that house over there. - No, I'm not walking any further. - What are you talking about? - I'm sitting down. - It's freezing! I'm not walking another inch. - Come on! - Don't you get it? They don't give a shit about us. He doesn't even like you anymore. What a hell do you know about that? Are you a mute? Come on, tell me! Because he was unfaithful! Yes, with me. - What? What are you talking about? - Klara, it was not on purpose. I'm sorry, but I visited him. I didn't mean for it to happen. I'm sorry, it was really very stupid. - You take all the guys! - You fucking... - Let go! - Are you dumb! You're not allowed to fight! - I hate you! - You make all the decisions. He was mine! - What a hell does that have to do it with it? - Maybe I also wanted to play the bass. You had decided that he was mine and then you took him! That's your fault! - It's your fault too! - You took him! - It's all your fault. Go to hell! - Thanks, you too! Fuck, I hate you! What a hell... Wait, come here... Can't you stop it now? Can't you come here and sit down, please? - Klara, you're so childish. Sit down. - Stop it! Can't you guys be friends? He's an idiot. He's not worth being fought over. Think like this: Feel sorry for him. Who wants to live in Solna? Klara? You guys are so childish! - Stop it! Come and sit down. - Stop it, Hedvig. - I am stronger than you. - I will not sit next to her. It's only the band that matters, not Elis. Please, can you please shake hands? - We're practicing tomrrow. - Hedvig, can you knock it off? - Why not? - Because it was you who did something dumb. - I'm going to hit you. - Why should I apologize to her? This was all Bobo's fault, but you have also been dumb. - She cheated with my boyfriend! - Klara, you're being so childish. - She's the childish one! - No, both of you. - Knock it off! - And then you say this: -“I like you.” - Knock it off! "Vi tycker om varandra." -“I like you.” - I like you. - Say it now. - It's your turn. I like you so fucking much too. People die every day and you only care about your football team In Africa the children are starving, and you only care about the football field Nuclear plants are poisoning our air, and you play ice hockey and think it's tough The atom bomb blows up our cities You go and buy new tennis clothes Go. Go! What does it matter? It's just a ball! - Come on, we're late. - Have you got picks, drumsticks? - This is where we're going to play? - Yes. I don't want to! I have forgot the lyrics. I don't know the lyrics! - Com on. Here's some water. - They are going to kill us. I don't want water from Vasteras. Gross Vasteras, it's like a carrot here! - Stop putting on make up. - We're not putting on make up! It's going to go great. - It's not Elis again is it? - That was a hundred years ago. - Good. You sure? - Yeah! - Now we're going to play! - And have fun. Come here. Check this out. - What do you see? We are so good! - We're doing it! - Jump! Then we'll get going. - Okay, a deep breathe.
