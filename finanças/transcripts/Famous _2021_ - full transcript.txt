[light music] [gentle music] [people chattering] [upbeat music] [heart beating] [audience applauding] [upbeat rock music] [Camera Operator] Camera, speed, and we are rolling. [Interviewer] So, Jason, how do you feel about your first Oscar nomination? I'm grateful for the nomination, and honored to be amongst some of the most talented people of all time. But in all honesty, I don't think any of this really matters. It's, it's not why I do it. [Interviewer] So, wait a minute, are you saying you're not happy about the nomination? No, not at all. But it doesn't make me any better than anyone else. I never wanted the fame, even as a kid. I was just never comfortable with the attention that came outside of the work. I think it's sad that people care more about celebrities than what's going on in the world. [Interviewer] But that's Hollywood. You know how the business works. Oh, I know exactly how the business works, and the business needs to change. - There he is! - There he is! Jason! [Announcer] The 1994 nominations for Best Actor are, Jason Mast for... [Reporter] Rumors are circulating after The Enquirer published some damaging photos. [Reporter] Well, I guess it's just another day in Hollywood. [gentle music] [phone ringing] [Jason panting] [upbeat music] [Phone Answer Machine] Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. [Mother On Phone] Oh, my god. You did it! Sweetie, sweetie, pick up the phone. It's your mother. [Phone Answer Machine] Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. [Woman On Phone] Jason, come on, answer your phone. Dylan said... [knocking] [Celeste] It's Celeste! I'm over this hermit shit. You need to come out now, everyone is here to see you. The host cannot miss the party. All right, I know you hate this crap, but you don't have to stay out there for long, you just need to make an appearance! [phone ringing] [knocking] Hey, dude. It's Ryan. Open up. Come on, man. [ominous music] Jason Mast. You talented motherfucker! God, I've missed your ass. Give me a break, Steve. Just put her on the fucking cover with Jason. Heather Hayes is the new it girl. I'm telling you right now. Well, if you don't, you're not getting the interview with Jason, and that would suck. 'Cause everyone wants him right now. He's nominated for a fucking Oscar, for Christ's sake. You know, I have to go. Call me Monday. Hey. Hey, Hey! Let me see those beautiful eyes, all right? Not yours. Come here, come here. Come here. You look a little tired, all right? So fix yourself up a bit. Okay. Hey! I'm very proud of you. This is your time, now go out there and enjoy it. [phone rings] What? I told you no! I mean it, Steve. No cover, no interview. You look thin. It's the drugs. Oh, shut up. I thought you stopped all that shit. I did. Yeah, and what was the deal with that boy's trip to Miami? You see the pictures? They're everywhere. Do you want to keep making the kind of money you're making or not? I'm gonna do what I do. I don't give a shit what you do. Just don't do it in public places where they can take pictures and put it in all those magazines. Okay? You know, you could've gotten a supporting actor nomination if you had taken it all, mm, just a bit more seriously like I told you. Mm-hmm... What? [knocking] You've gotta be kidding me. - Who is it? - It's Alyssa. Not right now. Ryan! What, am I not VIP enough to party in your room? No, no, no, no, no! - I missed you, dick. - [grunts] Okay How long have I been telling you this was gonna happen, since you were what, like 16? I'm so proud of you. It's handled. Marissa's sending the pictures of you guys to the Enquirer. Wait? That secret engagement crap? No, it's you and Alyssa fighting, making up, blah, blah, blah. I told you I'd get you the best publicist, did I not? You know, it is all gonna come out eventually. And you embarrassed the shit out of me with those pictures. You didn't even tell me you were going to Miami. I don't have to tell you everything I do. Why are you such a little bitch lately? All right, you two. No, I'm sick of his shit. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Millions of people buy tickets to see Ryan Logan, their hero cannot be- - Oh, my God! I get it, Celeste. Look, I wanna talk to Jason alone, can you give us a few minutes? - We'll be right out. - Fine. Take your time, but hurry it up. [phone rings] What? Yeah, I know. You've told me multiple times. I know. Yes. Oh, I know... Jason. Jason. Jason. [voices whispering] Why haven't you returned any of my calls this week? I, I called you. I never got your messages. You know I hate machines. Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude, take off your glasses. - Why? - Because I wanna look - into your eyes, bro. - What the fuck? What... What's going on with you? [phone rings] Nothing. [Phone Answering Machine] Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. [Mother On Phone] Jason, answer your phone! Come on, baby. I know we haven't talked in a really long time, but I want to see you. Mommy's back on the scene, huh? Yeah, she's been calling me non-stop, dude. Don't let her get to you. Okay? You're an Oscar-nominated actor now. You made this happen. She didn't. You should have been nominated too. You killed it up there. This isn't about me. This is about you. Look, I know you hate all this shit, but let's just go out there and have some fun tonight. Huh? Tonight isn't about having fun. Whoa, so you're still going through with it? Of course. Are all the security cameras set up? They were tested this morning. They're in every room of the house. Is Jack definitely coming? Celeste said he was confirmed. I'm not leaving this room until it's done. You know what this is gonna do to Alyssa? We'll get her through it. Man, are you sure you want to go through with all of this? Yes. I have to do this. I, I can't keep hold on to it, man, it's killing me. Man, can't you just let it all go? Can you? - [knocking] - Hey, bro. It's Dylan. I'm holding down the fort, but it is madness out here. I'm coming back in a few minutes, and I will drag your ass out if I have to!! Hey, yo, baby, wait up! What's your name? Dylan doesn't know, so don't say anything to him. He's not going to be able to handle it. Okay. Hey, look at me. No hard drugs tonight, right? - I know. - No. I mean it. I know. You too. Man, I told you in Vegas, I'm done with all that shit. I haven't touched it since. [knocking] [Celeste] Jason. Jack Rossi just got here. We have a surprise for you. Come on out! [Ryan] We'll be right out! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Let's just go out there for a little bit, huh? Try to enjoy yourself, just a little, will ya? Do one round with me, hm? One round with me, then you can come back in here and hide for the rest of the night, okay? Yeah? [laughs] Jason Mast, everybody! [Jack] Where's the man of the hour? [Voices] Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. ♪ Clean my slate ♪ ♪ Dip my hands in fire ♪ ♪ Feel my eyes roll back and my soul attack ♪ ♪ Every thought I find ♪ ♪ And I should paint my face ♪ ♪ Before I go outside ♪ ♪ I'm gonna bathe in salt 'til my teeth go numb ♪ ♪ Devil in disguise ♪ [heart beating] - [knocking] - Hey. It's Alyssa. Jason! Get the fuck up! Okay! Oh, god! It's a fucking party. Are you seriously sleeping? Jason! Heather just arrived. She was looking for you. Hey, girl. Don't you look fabulous. So do you! [laughs] I'm so happy for you, babe! - Congratulations. - Thanks. You're totally gonna win. I love the new script changes that you made, by the way. I, I just, I keep reading them over and over again, and I just, I cry every time. I mean, people know that you are a great actor, but when they realize that you wrote this! - Okay! [laughs] - Oh, my God. I, I'm really sorry. It's cool. I just really connect to this part and I know you're still looking for the financing... - Oh, no he's not. - What? I wanted to surprise you. Jack Rossi has come on board. He's fully financing your project. It's done. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Uh, excuse me, please. What the fuck? Jack Rossi, really? You wanted it done, and I got it done. You could be filming by summer, and he's financing it himself. You wrote it, you're starring in it, it's your movie and everyone's gonna know it. Whatever issues you have with him, let it go and take the fucking money. Jason doesn't want me in the movie, does he? He's gonna cast that new Gwyneth girl, or Cameron, or Winona, because everyone just wants Winona. Will you stop it? Now, I can't leave the show. So let's just tell Jack that I'm signing on, I'll do one more season, or something. I don't want to hear another word about that show. You are bigger than TV now. Do you want to be a movie star, or what? Hey. How much do you love your new nose? I love it. I feel a lot better. Yeah, all right look. I will handle Jack Rossi. You just worry about Jason. Don't leave his side tonight. Like I told you, Jason is all about chemistry and I want him to feel the chemistry between you two. Now, go make him notice you. Stand up, you're slouching. Hey. I've been looking all over for you. You just left me. I don't know anyone here. I was standing there all awkward, like an idiot. People started giving me drink their orders. Why is he here? Heather, I have told you a million times, publicly, you're single. If you care about her career, stay away from her for the night. Or you could just leave. [phone rings] You know, we have work to do here. What? No, no, I can barely hear you. Y'know, let me call you from the landline. So, do you wanna go back to the party? Or we could just stand here staring at Jason Mast all night. [Heather] Brody, I told you that tonight's all about work. [Alyssa] Why are you here? Alyssa, stop flirting with me. God, you wish. Heather, come to the bathroom with me. I need to talk to you for a minute. Hey, man. I'm Brody. I'm Heather Hayes' boyfriend. Oh. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. I'm a big, big fan. I've seen all your movies. [laughs] I watched "Boys of Summer", like, 100 times in high school. Me and my buddies quote that all the time. That's cool. Cool, cool. [Brody] It's a great place you got here, man. Thank you for letting me come. Oh, no problem. [Brody] Great views. Thank you. Hey, I'm a writer! Uh... Oh! Okay. Oh, um, y'know actually, I have a script. It's, um, it's a lot like "Boys of Summer", a coming of age story, y'know, and uh, um... That was so stupid... I'm a writer, coming of age story, like you give a shit. How lame was that, huh? Hey, giant movie star, I'm a nobody, let me tell you about my awesome new script. Shut-up, Brody. [laughs] Bit of a nervous talker, that's probably why I'm a writer, huh? Huh, huh? I can see that. I will see you... Got a cigarette? Sorry, I don't smoke. Pft, that's lame. So, you in the biz? I feel like I've met you before. Did we got wasted together at Drew's house? Never been to Drew's. Oh! She's so sweet. I know, it was backstage at the Pumpkins show. Yeah, I don't listen to them. Oh, the Nirvana show? Uh, I don't know famous people, I hate grunge music, and we definitely haven't met before. No, no, no, no. No! No drinking and you are leaving by midnight. Give me that! A martini, really? Where is your mother? By the pool. She's already wasted. Figures. Did you get a boob job? Do they look good? Pull this shit out. You look ridiculous. You told me that flat chested only works with modeling and I would never get cast with that heroin-chic look. Right, and we will deal with that when you are 18. My mom already made me an appointment. And I'm canceling it. I'm in charge of the business that is Caley Miller, and those tits are my business. Fine. Do you wanna meet Jason? - Yes! - Jason meet Caley Miller. She's 16, just got to L.A. a few weeks ago. She's a model. I'm getting her into acting now. Isn't she gorgeous? - Uh, she is. - I'll be right back. It's so nice to officially meet you. I love all your movies. I used to have posters of you everywhere on my walls when I was a kid. I was, like, totally obsessed with you. Oh, you're very sweet. I hope you stay that way. - Um... - Huh? - Um... - Get your ass over here! We're gonna start your night off with some shots. My favorite boys! Now the party starts! Here, I'm good on drinks, thank you. Just like the old days. But where's Logan's ass? Who cares. I hate him. - You hate everyone. - No, not you. Ooh. All right. To my brother! The best fucking actor in this town! Okay. Plus I got some good blow. So, get over here and put this shit up your nose. Okay, you first.

If I would have just done what I was supposed to do. But I couldn't, okay? And you were always gonna be better than me, anyway. I think you could have been a great actor. He was. You were great in all those cereal commercials. I was, wasn't I? Still, he wrote me a part in his new movie. It's a dope scene... See, he just smiled at you. Now, get Brody out of here, and stop the slouching, stop that slouching! I'm starting my own t-shirt line. Really? And that's why I wanna be a vampire. [hisses] Oh! Excuse us. Your tits look great by the way. I know, right? They're new. Hey, so are you ready to leave? I know you hate this shit. Yeah, we can go now, whatever you want. I can't go, but you can totally leave. Seriously? 'Cause Celeste wants me to go, you want me to go? I get it. You just wanna hang with Jason Mast all night. Brody. It's every day. You're just obsessed with this. I see the way you look at him. Shit, I see the way I look at him. I'm not an idiot, Heather. You're gonna sleep with him tonight, aren't you? I need you to stop being so insecure. I have to do this. I need this part in his movie. Okay? Hey. I love you. Did you see that Ryan Logan's here? I did. Why don't you go find him. Tell him about your script. Oh sure, yeah. Let me just walk up to him. Hey, buddy, I got a great script and I think it is perfect for you. [laughs] Well, I don't know him, but I'll help introduce you. Come on. Let's go. No, but that's what you have to do to win an Oscar. You know what I mean? Like, you have to play a retarded person, or a crippled person, or an ugly person, or get really, really fat, and I'm just not willing to do any of those things. Like, I could. I mean I know I have the potential in me to do it. I just need the opportunity, you know? Like, I need my breakout role. No, you need a comeback role. - Suck it, Dylan. - Fuck! I just need my "Pretty Woman," you know? My "Thelma and Louise." Oh, I see rehab, did you good, huh, buddy? You know what? Suck it, Logan. - Been there, done that. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. - No!

I can't believe you're finally gonna nail that son of a bitch. Wait, what do you mean? Uh, Nothing, I just meant we can do what we want now. This lady came up to me yesterday with her daughter. The daughter said she loved me, wanted a hug, and then said she wanted to be me. I mean, I don't know, it kinda, like, freaks me out. Okay, I'll be back, lovers. Hey, nice moves you got there.

You've seen her billboard, it's across from Chateau. No, I'm too fucked up to see anything when I'm at Chateau. I'm a huge fan. I used to make my mom tape your show, when I was a kid, so I could watch it over and over. Me and my friends totally wanted to be you. Really. That's so sweet. When we thought you died in that car accident, and then Jesse confronts you and Billy in the hospital and he's all, "It's either him or me, Miranda, but know this." [Booth] "I loved you since the moment I saw you, baby!" Oh! I love Jesse. All my friends were team Billy, but I was just team Miranda. Y'know, you're really pretty. Sit down with us. Here. No! No, no, no. She's 16. - So, let her try it once. - No! You know what? I do recognize you. I have seen your billboard. I totally fucked the model in the photo with you. Oh, really? Yeah, I'm sorry, are you sleeping with him? [laughs] No. Well, why not? I don't know. Shut up! Are you a virgin? Really? Good for you. Yeah, but I suck a lot of dick though.

I'll call you both a taxi. You! You need to pull yourself together and focus on Jason. You are so close, don't blow it doing drugs with some has-been TV star. She can't even get her father to put her in a film in this town. Hey! Alyssa Rossi is over, and so is that show, and it would already have been canceled if you hadn't come on last season. Oh! And you have coke on your nose, by the way. Yeah. Stop the crap! [phone ringing] Stop the slouching! Oh what! I know. I know! Hey, guys. Jason, um, this is a great party.

And, it's um, it's actually, um- - Hey! Did you see that babe that was here earlier? Y'know, tall, hot, legs. She's friends with Drew Barrymore and Kurt Cobain. I, I don't think she's actually friends with them. I mean, she told me she wants to be a vampire. Who the hell is this guy? He's cool. He's Heather's boyfriend. Oh, really? This guy? Hey, man. What do you do? I'm a writer. Oh, really, anything I've seen? Um. Not yet. - But I have this script- - Me too. Hey, I got some, uh, y'know treats. Just the three of us. - How 'bout we- - No, no, no, no. II told you, I'm done with all that shit. And please don't give anything to Jason either. Don't be such a pussy, Logan. I mean it, Dylan. Nothing to Jason. Hey, man! You're still fucking standing there? Did y'know you're sketchy and starting to freak me out! Hey, man, I'm sorry about him. I will catch up with you later, okay? [Brody] Cool. Nice to meet you. Look, it's just like the old days. Y'know. When was the last time we were all together? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I will think about it. Okay, but before the night's up. Okay? Hey Jason, everyone's gone. Can I come in? [Jason] No. C'mon man, open the door. You know, I'm not trying to control you. I just- - [Jason] It's all good. It's just, I just need a minute. All right, well I'll come back for you later, okay? Jason? [Jason] Yeah, thanks. [tense music] [people shouting] [phone ringing] [Phone Answer Machine] Hey.

It, hey, is there anything in the movie for Dylan? Nope. Not this time. But you're still looking for stuff for him, right? Absolutely. Absolutely, Jen. Uh, you know what? How 'bout I take Dylan to a ball game this weekend? Y'know, give us some time to be alone. I can work with him on some acting stuff. I think this would be great for Dylan. - Hey, can I go too? Please? - Oh! No, buddy, not this time. Just me and Dylan, okay? I, I think we need some bonding time. Okay? But I am gonna make it up to you. All right? I promise. And you, mister, huh? You... [laughs] You got a lot of work to do. Uh, Jen? I need to talk to you about some contract stuff in the other room. Jason, just sit tight. - So, you know, I act too. - You're an actress? - Mhm. - Wow!

You're not eating dinner tonight, okay? Dylan and I are gonna go out, while you sit here ...look at me, and go over the script Paulie sent. Okay? I don't care if you have to stay up all night long, I want you off book by the morning. Understand? All right, I love you. I do, I love you, I love you. Okay. Dylan! Get in here! Dylan! Take it back. Mom, take it back! No, I, I really can't listen to this any more. Okay? So, I'm gonna hang up now. Mom! - I'm hanging up now - Mom, this is Jason. If you call this house one more time, I'm calling my lawyers, and you know what that means. Dylan hang up the phone! Are you sure that I don't look fat in this dress? I've barely been eating. God, you have nothing to worry about. All right? Your body's perfect, your hair is perfect, and now your nose is perfect. Do you really think so? Heather, you're so hot, it's ridiculous. No, you're so hot [sniffs] and you're so talented. And you, like, [sniffs] nail every scene that we're in. I don't even know how you manage to... - Um... - Are you into this? I have a boyfriend. Okay. Well, same sex hook-ups don't count as cheating. I've never been with a girl before. [Alyssa] Well, no guy can please a girl like a girl can. Sorry, boys. That's some bullshit. Oh, these are perfect. I'm so jealous. Well, they cost my father a fortune. Speaking of my father, I feel like you've been avoiding him tonight. Just be honest, you're not planning on re-signing on my show, are you? Don't lie to me. Because I hate liars. I want to, but Celeste thinks that I shouldn't. I know that my character has helped boost the ratings back up, and I told her that I didn't want to just abandon it. Hey. I've been looking all over for... Are you doing coke? This is a really big night for me, like, a really big night. I'm under a lot of pressure and you just don't seem to get it. I mean, everyone is looking at me, and you just keep embarrassing me in front of Jason. I'm embarrassing you? Tell me the truth, are you sleeping with him? Oh, my god! You can't even support me for one night? I mean, I am doing all of this for us. Do you not realize how big this could be for my career, and for yours? - Bullshit! - You're just jealous. Jealous of what? Of these people? Of this life that that you once thought was a bunch of bullshit too? This is what you're working so hard for? You wanna be like her? Another coked out, mediocre actress? Alyssa doesn't have to work for anything. She's got daddy's money to fall back on. - You need to go home! - No! If this Jason Mast movie is so important and the only way you can get the part is to fuck him, then fuck him! Go home. No. We're leaving together, or we're done. Well it looks like you're done. Are you gonna go save him now? Here. This will make it better. [soft music] You got balls, man. I don't think anyone's ever said anything like that to Alyssa. At least not to her face. You all right? Yeah, I'm cool. You want a cigarette? I quit. You want a cigarette? Yeah. [knocking] You cannot come in here. But I thought you liked me. Look, kid, you're hot as fuck. Okay? And when you're 18, if I'm still alive, call me. Okay, first off, don't call me kid. I hate that. It's condescending. Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you- - And second off, you're a kid, your room's a mess. You're a total slob. Okay, you're a sassy little thing, aren't ya? Do you have a cigarette? That I can do. But not in here. Outside, where everyone can see us. No. We're not ready to announce it yet. But if everything goes the way it's supposed to... No, no, no don't worry. I know how to handle Jack Rossi. I don't know, man, something about her's changed. It could be the new nose. I don't think it's the new nose. It might be, but that's not what I mean. Seriously, dude? Heather's just doing what she has to do. Look, she wants to be in his movie. It's a great part, it's great for her career, and Jason has no interest in Heather. Trust me. And even if they did fuck, it doesn't mean anything. What are you taking about? That would change everything. Why? She loves you, dude. It'll all work out. You smoke pot? Uh, not any more. It makes me paranoid. Well, tonight you do. Come on. No, I mean it, Alyssa. I, I really do love him. I mean, look at you and Ryan. You know how it is. I'm not in love with Ryan. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. That's not what our relationship is about. Okay. Well, I don't know that much about you two, but I see it every time that you're with him. It's all over your face. You're kidding me? You've been with Heather since you were 15 and she's the only one you've been with? Yeah. Then how do you even know you're in love with her? I don't know any more. What about you? Are you in love with Alyssa? Uh, she's one of my best friends, and we fuck from time to time... But no, I'm not in love with her. That whole thing about us being a couple is just a cover. [coughs] Cover for what? [Heather] But you and Ryan have sex, right? Yeah, all the time. But, so what? We have sex with a lot of people. - Guys and girls? - Yeah. Ryan Logan has sex with dudes? Sometimes. Well then, he's gay. No, he's not gay. No gay man could do what Ryan does to me. Besides, I hook up with girls, and I'm not a lesbian. Yeah, well it's different for girls. No, it's not. Everyone is bisexual, girls are just man enough to admit it. You're not getting it dude. It's not about the fucking. I mean, you can fuck night after night, and it can mean nothing. It's all about the connection between two souls, you know? What are you talking about? Okay. I think we're all just souls, man. I believe a real connection can be with a male or a female. It's about getting to that deeper level where we're all just the same. You know? No sexuality, no religion, no judgment. Even if you just hook up for one night. All right, if you're just there with the other person, looking into their eyes, and touching them, y'know? Soul to soul? To me, that's love. You gotta meet Ryan. He's the best. I love that guy. Yeah, I can tell. What does that mean? I don't know. It's just I saw you hitting his ass earlier, you two were, like, all over each other. Seems pretty weird to me. No guys in Idaho act like that. Okay, well this ain't Idaho. Well, I know that. There's just something different with all you guys. We've been through a lot of shit together. Okay? Shit you wouldn't even believe. I guess. But I do not know how you do that. I could never be with someone who didn't want just me. Look, what you have with Brody might work for you, but I don't need to be tied down like that. I can sleep with whoever I want to, too. Say whatever you want, but I still think you're in love with him. Get real, Alyssa. Oh, you want to get real? Let's get real. I don't believe you. You've never had a connection with a guy? No! Why would I lie? I have nothing to hide? God, that must be nice. Mm. What? Not having anything to hide. I feel like I'm always hiding. Man, fuck what everybody says. So what, if you're like, attracted to souls, or whatever. Oh, man. I like you, Brody. You're a good dude. You're different. Different from what? Different from everyone in my life. Answer the fucking question, Heather! You think I'm an idiot? You fuck Jason, and he puts you in his movie, and then you don't need my show. Right? Right. Because you have no fucking loyalty. Well, what would you do? I wouldn't have that problem. Because I was born in. You have to fuck your way in. What the hell just happened in here? You know she could blow this whole thing. You go after her and fix it before she talks to her father. Let's go. So, what? You just believe everything you read and you thought I was gonna be some asshole, huh? No, no, not an asshole. Just not this normal guy. Well I mean, I guess you're not that normal, you've been famous since you were a teenager. God, that must have been a nightmare for your parents. Actually, I was emancipated from them when I was 16. It's their choice by the way. Y'know that way I could work longer hours and make a lot of people a lot more money. That's pretty shitty. I can't imagine growing up that way. But, but I guess none of that matters now, now you can have whatever you want, huh? Why? Because I have a lot of money? Money can't get you everything you want. That's not what I meant. Yes, it is. You, god, you look at me and you think I have it all. Y'know, but everything that I do gets blasted out to the world for everyone to see. You have no idea what that's like. People thinking they know everything about you. Really they know nothing at all. [soft music] [water splashing] [laughs] Hey, boys, come on. No running around the pool! What'd I say? I'll come over there and snap you right in the ass, you little fuckers. [laughs] So, you going in, huh? It's pretty warm. - I, I'm not sure. - Yeah? Well, I'm glad I convinced your mother to let you stay here tonight. Me too. You know, Jason, I think you... I think you... [laughs] You are gonna be a big star. - You really think so? - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You're better than all these little shits. Except for one. Huh? Now, you see that boy right there? That is Ryan Logan. You heard of him? Yeah, of course. He's got that TV show. He's amazing. That's right. He's got a great career. And I got the same plans for you. Huh, huh? [both laugh] [Paulie] What happened? Where's your sock, huh? Didn't I tell you to always wear a sock in there? [Jason] I'm, I'm sorry, Paulie. I forgot. - Better? - Oh yeah. See? Much better. Much better. You're still a sexy son of a bitch, though, either way. All right? So you are gonna sleep in my wing tonight. Yeah. Ryan's gonna be there too. And Dylan, if he behaves! [Caley] So, you just didn't like acting? No. I did like acting. I loved it, actually. But there were just certain things that they wanted me to do that I just couldn't do. Y'know, maybe I should've, maybe things would be a lot different. There was just some stuff that I wasn't willing to do. Like what? Hey Dylan, come on now! All right? Slow down! Be careful! I don't want any of you boys drowning on my watch! Jason, come on, man. You seem shy. All right? Come on, let's get the fun started, huh? We gotta get you out of your shell, and get you in that pool. - Okay. - All right, good. Now there, there's some pool rules here after dark. All right? Number one, you always stick with a buddy. Okay. Number two, no peeing in my pool. [laughs] Okay. And number three, no suits after dark. - Um, what? - All right? It just helps you to become a better actor, more vulnerable. Trust me. Take that. Call your mother, tell her you're gonna stay here for the weekend. [rhythmic music] I'm still a virgin, Ryan. I haven't even gotten my dick sucked yet! Fuck you dude. Yeah, yeah, I'm still at Paulie's. I'm staying here for a week. I got auditions and stuff to work on. No, um,... it's just me. Uh, Dylan left last night. What are you talking about? Well, I just got an amazing call about you. Yeah, I think this could be your big break. Now, it's a film called the "Boys of Summer" and it's produced by Jack Rossi. Yeah, we got a meeting in the morning, Jack wants to meet you. - Really? - Yep. - That's huge. - [laughs] Yeah. Y'know your mother, she's very excited about this meeting. Y'know she's very proud of you. So she thinks it's best that you stay here tonight since you gotta be up so early. Okay. Y'know Jason, this is a major game changer for you and your family. You seem nervous. Am I ready for this? [chuckles] Come on. Let me help you relax. All right? Come here. You trust me? Yeah. There you go. [laughs] Yeah. You know, we're pretty close, right? I mean other than being your manager, we're buddies, right? Of course, Paulie. You're, like, one of my best friends. Good. I'm glad you feel that way. Y'know, because trust is very important between a manager and his client. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've worked my ass off for you, and tomorrow? Whoo, tomorrow's gonna be the biggest day of your life, so far, all right? I can't tell you how many boys would want this opportunity, to meet Jack Rossi and make all their dreams come true, huh? Your buddy Ryan... Your buddy Ryan's already met Jack, and Ryan knows how to make a deal happen. Now, we were young and we had all this money just thrown at us. I know that sounds really great, but everything has a price. Meaning? You okay? Yeah, man. I'm fine. Let's go get a drink. [Celeste] Jason! Jack's leaving soon, he's looking for you. I'll bring him back here. [tense music] We have to bring them down, Ryan! No! No, I don't care what kind of power he has! No! It's not right. You were shaking the other night, and Dylan couldn't even walk. Fuck Jack Rossi, man! [knocking] Okay, I'll be right out. Hold on! [Jack] It's Jack. [heart beating] There's the man of the hour. Come on, bring it in, man. See, I deserve a bigger hug than that. Congrats on that nomination. You earned it, huh? Come on, man, make me a drink. We got a lot to discuss. You know what I like. You must be flying high about now. Best actor nomination, at your age. [laughs] Personally, I thought the film sucked, but your performance was solid, as usual. I told you. Told you the day you walked into my office, I was gonna make you a star. ♪ If I just had the confidence ♪ ♪ I could claim, about this ♪ ♪ Can't break my frustration ♪ Oh, finally.

[Jack] [laughs] So, I'm not even gonna get a thank you, am I? Thank you for what? For financing your movie. Come on, Jason. You know we make a great team. [soft music] Hey, Daddy! I've been looking all over for you. You wanted to see Heather? Well, don't you look gorgeous. - Hello, Mr. Rossi. - Oh, Mr. Rossi? I think you'll be calling me Jack again before long. Where have you been hiding? Hiding? What do you think I've been doing all night? Some people work, Alyssa. I've had business to take care of all over this place. What are you eating? There's no carbs in this, Daddy. Do you see Heather eating that junk? By the way, Heather, you look stunning. You see, that's what a star looks like. ♪ I'm gonna have once, type of thing ♪ ♪ God bless these boys and God bless these kids ♪ Hey, Jack. Well, who is this gorgeous lady? Hi, I'm Jack.

Daddy, listen, I was thinking about my birthday next week. - What if we go together- - Let's get her on the show. Let's get her on the show. So, big night for Jason. I always knew he was gonna be a star. Same feeling I had about you. You know I gave him his big break, right? A little film called, "Boys of Summer". You were 16 in that, isn't that right, Jason? ♪ There's something creeping ♪ ♪ Beneath my sleeping ♪ ♪ There's monsters at home ♪ ♪ I feel so alone ♪ Jason, hello. Nice to finally meet you. Paulie's been talking about you for months. He speaks highly of you, and he knows how to spot talent. That's nice of him. Well, you know I always bring you the best, Jack, right? [laughs] You want a drink? I won't tell your mother. Oh, I, I tried it before. I don't like the taste. [Jack] Be a man, Jason, and have a drink. Your buddy Ryan drinks with me, and he's 16. Yeah. Go ahead. I can take it from here, Paulie. Whatever you say, Jack. [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're gonna do a little improv. I'll be the love interest and I'm in danger. And you're the hero. You ready? - Yeah. - Yeah? Action! Help me! Help me, please help me! I'm here. What's going on? Are you okay? No, my arm! There's blood everywhere. He tried to kill me! Well, what are you just gonna do? Just stand there? The love of you life is dying. Do something, for Christ's sake. Take your shirt off, wrap it around my wound. Okay, okay, not bad. Not bad. We gotta do a little work on the arms and the abs. I'll get you a trainer. That'd be awesome. See, as far as the acting, though? You're holding back. Look, you wanna be a leading man, you gotta be comfortable with yourself as a man, you're not a little boy any more. You gotta be naked in front that audience, son. 'Cause that camera doesn't lie. Take off the pants for a second. I need to see what we're working with. What? Come here. Closer. Nah, you're still holding back, Jason. I mean, don't you want your career to take off like your buddy Ryan's? Yeah? Then be a big man and take off the pants, and the boxers. [surreal music] - Isn't that right, Jason? - What? Hey Daddy, how long are you staying, because I think the three of us need to have a talk. About an hour. I'm leaving for Italy in the morning, I haven't packed a thing. Well, how long are you going? A few weeks. But, Daddy, my birthday's next week. And you promised that we would go together. Well, throw any party you want, sweetheart. Just send the bill to Maria. I'll cover the whole thing. No, forget it. I'll just call Mom. Like your mother's gonna do something for your birthday. You'll be lucky if she remembers to call you. Don't worry, we already have something planned for your birthday. Daddy, please, just talk to me for a second- - That's enough! You're embarrassing yourself. This conversation is over. I will deal with you later. Hey. Hey, are you okay? How's my new star? - Hi, Mr. Rossi. - You can call me Jack. - I'm upset with you. - Why? Because you haven't been in to see me yet. [Caley] I'm sorry. Celeste never told me anything about a meeting. Well, we didn't have one, but we could have one now. I got some projects I think you could be right for. You're not leaving yet, are you Carly? It's Caley. Actually, my mom's here. We're supposed to go home soon. No, no, no, no, no. I'll get a car for your mom. You're a big girl now. Come with me, we'll go somewhere and chat. Jason, I'll see you later. Heather, we're speaking before you leave. Uh, Caley, where are you going? [Caley] Me and Jack have a meeting. Dylan, Dylan!

I don't believe a word that comes out of that kid's mouth. Get your ass over here. Dylan lies about everything, so I don't blame you for not wanting to work with him. I will handle Jason. I'm sure he's just going along with his brother. You have a zit! You need to stay off the crafty, fatty. Great. Well, I am so glad we cleared this up. In fact, you can just go through me from now on. I think it's time we both move on from Paulie. Mm-hm, exactly. I'll be taking over as Jason's manager. Sounds good! Take care. Jack's sending you a car. You two have a meeting. I don't want to go. I don't care. I'm your manger now. I say what Jason Mast does. [tense music] You little shit! This is the thanks that I get, huh? See, I made you. I made you! And I can end you. I can fucking end you! I could make you and your brother disappear, and no one would even know that it was me. 'Cause that's the power that I have! What do you have? What do you have, huh? You got fucking nothing! Who's gonna believe a word that you say? Your own mother doesn't believe you. It's your word against mine, and who are they gonna believe? Who they gonna believe. [laughs] I just asked you a fucking question. Who the fuck are they gonna believe? You. Me! Me! So, keep your fucking mouth shut! What am I gonna do with that mouth? I should wash it out with soap. [laughs] I got a better idea. Forget about your mouth. Turn around, boy! Turn around! Oh, it'll be all right. [somber music] Jason? What's wrong? Baby, baby, baby, what's wrong? What happened? No, no, no. What happened? What happened? Tell me, I won't be mad. Baby... Okay. Okay, don't tell me. Don't tell, that's fine. ♪ When I heard the news ♪ ♪ I was flying ♪ ♪ I turned off the tube ♪ ♪ And decided to go fishing ♪ [phone ringing] [Phone Answering Machine] Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. [Lawrence] Hey buddy, it's Lawrence. Sorry to call so late, I was stuck on set. I'm so proud of you, man. I know you don't think you deserve this, but you do. You are a true artist, Mr. Mast. You followed your... Jesus Christ. Cut! Cut! Everyone just take five. I'm sorry about that last take, Lawrence. What the fuck is going on, man? - I'm just a little out of it. - You on drugs? No, sir. I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night and... Give me this. Don't fucking lie to me. This has been going on for a while now. It has got to stop! I don't know, I don't know who the fuck you're hanging out with, I don't know what people are telling you, but on my set, nobody does drugs, all right? That includes my actors. So, go back to your trailer, learn your fucking lines, and come back in a half hour ready to work. All right? [Jason] Yes, sir. I'm sorry, it will never happen again. Look, Jason, I know, I know I'm hard on you, all right? But that's because I believe in you, man! You're a great fucking actor. You got something really special. You take this seriously, you can go really far in this business. Just, you're 18 now, man, don't fuck it up. I'm really sorry. And yes, sir. I hear everything you're saying. Good. Good. Hey. Things, are they better at home? - Do you think I'm beautiful? - Yeah. Do you think I'm a star? [Jason] Yes, I do. You really think so? [Jason] You're really talented Mom. I told you a gazillion times. Oh, little man. [hiccups] Little man, little man. Do you think you're a star? I guess. Do you think you have the looks? What? I think you need an operation! What are you talking about? I think you need a nose job sweetie, it's too big. You got the schnozz from your father and it's why you're not booking. [hiccups] [Jason] What are you talking about, Mom? I just did two huge movies. Ugh. I know baby, and I am so, so, so, so proud of you, but the phone is not ringing and no one is sending any other scripts. So, what's next? We have to think about our future, now, okay? So, we could just trim a little right here... Ow, ow, ow that hurts! [laughs] Don't be such a baby! You have to lighten up. [laughs] Jesus, you are just like your father, so dramatic. [Mother hiccups] Uh, hey Lawrence. Uh, it's Jason. Remember that manager you wanted me to meet? I'm ready... Set up a meeting. - [knocking] - Jason, it's Celeste. Well, I just wanted to let you know that pretty much everyone's gone. Come on, open up. Jason! Open this door right now or I will have it busted down! Hey, what is going on with you? Why didn't you show up to set today? Oh uh, I'm uh, I'm just uh, not feeling well. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, come here. Come here. Come on, come on. All right, I'm just gonna take off the glasses, all right? Oh, my God. You look awful. I'm pretty sick. Bullshit. You're coming down. Jason, you messed up big time. Lawrence called. He's done. He, he wants to re-shoot all of your scenes. What? No. No, no, no look, I've... I've, I've got it under control. I'll, I'll get clean. I, I promise. Honey, no, no, no. Honey, you don't! All right? All right, all right, listen to me. I am not being your manager right now. I'm being your friend. All right? So now, I'm just gonna go get your stuff, we're gonna meet with Lawrence, and you're gonna go into rehab. What? I'm not going to rehab. [Celeste] Yes you are! I don't need to listen to this shit. Jason. Jason, wait! Jason! [knocking] Jason? Come on. You know I plan on seeing those eyes before I leave. I'll be back. Hey. I just want you to know, I'm really proud of you. I'm so proud of you. This is not, look, it's not easy, a kid your age, to get clean? That's amazing. I owe it all to you and Celeste. - Well... - I can't thank you enough. Look, I'm so grateful for everything you've done for me. Uh, look, just, you did this. Remember that, all right? - Huh? - I know. Thanks. Come here. Come here, man. All right. Get back to work, all right? Right back. Hey, man! I never thought I'd be doing this. Doing, doing what? I am drinking and I am smoking with Ryan fucking Logan. Man, I've seen every movie you ever made. Twice. And I think the film that you did with Jason was your best work yet. That scene when you two are by the campfire... It's just a job, man. No, no! It's just a job. It is just like, seriously, just like - in "Boys of Summer" - - Yeah. When, when you two, it's just- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enough. Enough, enough... How do you figure out how to, you're so fucking real! Dude, enough man! Look, I'm not hanging out with you because I need another fan, okay? Look, I, I have enough fucking fans. I am hanging out with you because I think you're cool. Why are you hanging out with me, hm? Because you want your script read? Because you think that I can do something for you? Because I am Ryan fucking Logan? Man, I liked you because you were real. I'm sorry, but I'm a fan. A big fucking fan, and have been since I was 12. And fuck you for saying I'm not real. I've been nothing but real with you the whole night. You know what? I do have something I want to say to you. You pick shitty fucking movies. You're a great actor. Shitty movies. Last three you did? Aside from the one with Jason, sucked. No plot. And, yeah, maybe I do want you to read my script, or something like it, because you should be doing something that matters! Something that has something to say! - [knocking] - Who is it? It's me. Where have you been? Oh, looking for you. [laughs] You again. [Brody] Hey. Sorry I was such a dick earlier. I mean, I should go. No one's going anywhere. Oh yeah, Brody, please stay, and tell me more about what a great person I am. I should, I should probably go. Okay? You want your script read? That is messed up. Come on, man, please stay? I'll protect you. Mm. Nope. Dude, stay! I don't do that shit any more. Oh that's right. Well, we'll see how long that lasts. No, I should probably go and find... God, it looks like you're not going anywhere. I don't feel so well. So, you were discovered in a mall? - Yeah. - That's cool. And now Jack Rossi wants to put me in one of his projects. My friends back home are gonna go crazy. Maybe I could be on yours and Alyssa's show. He wants to bring me in for a general. When you go to meet with him, bring your mother. Can I please try some? - No. - Whatever, Heather. I'll just find some random guy to give it to me. Okay! okay. If you're gonna do it anyways, I would rather you do it with me. But if you tell anyone that I gave this to you, I will deny it. - Swear to God. - I won't. Just this one time, our secret. Okay? Promise. [slow electronic music] Dude, I feel like I can't breathe! - Dude, relax. - Did I smoke too much? I told you I can't handle this shit. Here, you're fine. Just have another shot. Dylan has some pills you can take. No, I took, I took my fucking pills today! - Well have some more. - My god! You're like, my little sister. I gonna protect you. Really? I never had a big brother or sister before! Well, now you do! It's me! [both laughing] Just chill, man. I got you, okay? I'll be right back. No, where are you going? Don't leave me... Um. Here, come here. Oh, god. Okay, just relax. Of course I'm gonna miss the show. I love the show, and I love working there and everyone's so, so nice to me, but I am getting in Jason's movie, and it's gonna be huge and he's so talented, he's like so amazing, and I just, I just, I don't even know how I could do the show once I started the movie and... Oh my God! You could take my place on the show! I could like die in a car accident or something, and Caley, Caley? Oh my God. Caley? Baby? Caley. Caley, please, please, please, say something! Caley, Caley. I love LA. Still alive? Barely. You know, just been embarrassing myself all night. Sometimes I can be a bit harsh, especially when I'm busy babysitting all of you. Y'know, maybe you need a babysitter. That's not what I need. I know what you need. Are you flirting with me? Maybe. Meet me in your room in five. Really? Hurry up before I change my mind. Done! I think I'm ready. I'm gonna do it tonight. I want Dylan to be my first. Uh, you are not gonna lose your virginity to Dylan Mast. Yes I am. What's the big deal? It's just sex. Uh, it's a big deal. But we have a connection. No, you don't. I was like in love with him the moment I saw him. Ooh, no, you weren't. That's why I quit smoking pot. I couldn't handle it. It made everything a little too real. Oh, and the coke makes the real go away? I want you to know what you said earlier messed me up. What did I say? You know what you said. You said I was a mediocre, coked out actress, with a huge trust fund. I'm so sorry. I, I, I didn't- - No, it's fine! It's fine. You were right! No, and it made me think and I hate people that make me think. Do you really think I'm a mediocre actress? - You all right? - Uh. Yeah. Uh, um, I'm, I'm just sweating. Uh, we just disappeared from the whole party. - I'm gonna check on Jason. - Hey! Just stay. Okay. Just calm down. Okay. No! Never again. Someone's awake. No, it's fine. Just go with it. - Hey, baby. - Eugh. I'm so confused. Don't be. Get out of your head, man. Stop thinking about everything so much. Hey. Just be here. Believe me, I'd love to, but I can't. I can't. Why? Because you're in love with Heather? I mean, do you think she hasn't hooked up with anyone else since you've been out here? Because she made out with me tonight. [upbeat electronic music] God, I needed that. You are officially my boy toy. But, I've gotta go, there's still business to handle tonight. Don't you ever take a break? I just did. You know, lady, you need more love in your life cause I don't think I've ever seen you smile. Actually, you had a pretty big grin on your face about five minutes ago. Eugh. You need to leave while I get dressed. Thank you very much. Are you serious? But we just has sex- - Get out. Get out! - This is my fucking room! [Celeste] Get out, boy toy! Get out! What the, you're fucking crazy- - [Celeste] Get the fuck out! Go have your cigarette. Stay away from Dylan Mast. - I will. - I'll meet you by the pool? - Okay. - Okay. - There's my star. - Hey, Jack. I feel like you've been avoiding me all night. I haven't been avoiding you. Don't think I don't know what you and Celeste are up to. What are you talking about? Oh, you think I'm an idiot? Celeste already told me you're not re-signing on the show. Well, I never told Celeste that. So, you are gonna sign a new contract? Would you stop the bullshit, Heather. You think you're gonna get in Jason's movie, then you don't need to re-sign on the show cause you'll be a big movie star. And that, that's what you want more than anything? Isn't it? Isn't it. Isn't it? Come on, Jack, make your move! I could end your fucking career. Who even says I'm giving you another season on the show? Maybe I fire Heather Hayes from the show 'cause she's difficult on set, or because of her little drug problem. Doesn't have to be like that. Come on, beautiful. I'm not your enemy. [laughs] God, I can't do this. Get off of me. Move out of the way of the door. - I want to leave. - No. This is not gonna happen, Jack. You mean it isn't gonna happen again, Jack. Get off of me! I made you! Don't you forget that! You were nothing before my show! Now you think you're too good for me? You fucked your way in, and we both know it. No! Get off of me! I made you! Don't you forget that! You were nothing before my show! Now you think you're too good for me? You fucked your way in, and we both know it. That's not what happened! Get off of me! Shut the fuck up! So the role is still yours, if you want it. Now you know what I want. Busted. Fuck! Fuck you Jack! You're going down, you son of a bitch. I got you. [laughs] [Heather] Jason! I need to talk to you. Jason, please open up! Jason. Jason! Open up! [panting] Jason! Jason, open up! [knocking] Jason, open up right now. Jason, open up! [knocking] Jason, open up right... What are these papers? Who is this Celeste? You made this woman your manager? Are you fucking kidding me? I am your mother, goddammit. I am the one who got your career started. I gave up everything for you and you are gonna leave me with nothing? Read your contract. You get 10% of everything until I die, under one condition: you stay out of my career, and out of my life. If you try to talk to me or contact me, that's a breach of contract, and you get nothing. Now, get out. We're done. Baby, how can you do this to me? I am your mother. No! You cared more about the money than being my mother! [Mother] No! Baby, you're my son and I just wanted you to be happy. No, you wanted me to be famous. No, Jason. Baby, no. No, this shit won't work any more. - Jason- - Get out. Get out! Get out of my house! My house! Jason! Open up! Let me in! Now! - Jason, please open up! - Hey! - Hey. - Are you okay? I don't know. Please, so I can talk to you. Look, I, I want, I want you know something, Heather. I think you're beautiful and you're very talented, and I care about you. But I would never cast you in a role because I wanted to sleep with you. I want you in this movie 'cause I think you're an amazing actress. I mean, all of this shit you've been doing tonight, come on, that's that's not you. You are better than that! This lifestyle. This celebrity bullshit? That's not why we do this. People are gonna remember you for something. What's that gonna be? [Both] Celebrity or an artist? Jason, please. Hey, are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm great! Now, go find Brody, and go home. I'll be in touch about the script next week. Oh, and don't worry about Jack. I'm gonna take care of him. What I say goes now.

Have you been avoiding me? I didn't know you were looking for me? I thought you were looking for Heather. Well, let me tell you something, Carly. I am always looking for new talent. Relax. We're just talking. You know, the first time I laid on eyes on you I knew I'd seen that face. You have that billboard on Sunset. [chuckles] I will bet there is not a guy in LA that ain't fantasizing about you. I got to tell you, though, you are even hotter in person. [chuckles] You're doing the right thing, though, going into acting. Modeling has a short lifespan. That's exactly what Celeste said. She's right. You should listen to her. See, she knows what I like. And she knows what it takes to make it as an actress in this business. I've always wanted to be an actress. I even did all my school plays. You did all your... [laughs] Look at that face. Do you know, I think you have more star quality than Heather Hayes. Oh, no. She's so gorgeous and so talented. She's a fucking bitch. Everybody knows it. I wouldn't trust her if I were you. She's got no loyalty. And loyalty's everything to me. Heather Hayes is finished in this business. - And do you know why? - Why? 'Cause, I made her, and I will end her. Do you party? - Of course, all the time. - Good girl. How would you like to be the next Heather Hayes? 'Cause you're talking to the right man. I'm not comfortable. Get off me! What's the matter? Are you not attracted to me? I'm 16, you're, like, old enough to be my dad. Well that's not a very polite thing to say, Carly. It's Caley! Get off of me! - Shut up! - Get the fuck off of me! - Shut up! - Get the fuck off of me! - Shut up! - Get the fuck off of me! Dylan! Dylan! I feel so much better, man. Tonight has been a great night. Things are gonna be different, okay? I'm gonna make you proud of me. You need a nose job, sweetie. [laughs] You got that schnozz from your father. - Hey. Jason? - You look like shit, bro. You're not gonna eat tonight. Okay. Get over here. Breathe. Breathe. Okay? Take one of these. Take one of these. You'll feel better. Okay? Just take it. Just relax. Relax, okay? I'll be back to check on you. Just stay here! I'll be back. [Voice] No, no! Fuck you! Fuck you! Get out of my house! Get out of my fucking house! [Jason screams] [Jason panting] [voices shouting indistinctly] Hey, I was looking for you... Caley. Caley? Hey, you okay? Caley, did something happen with Dylan? Caley. Did something happen with Jack? Just stay here and don't move, okay? It's gonna be fine. Caley. Caley! [Jason coughs] Caley. Come here. [coughs] [Jason gasps] Hey, man, I was just... Oh shit! - Holy shit! - Dude, help me! What are you doing? Jesus Christ! Man, just help me lift him to the bed! - Hey Jason, Caley's- - Heather! Hey! I need you to find Alyssa for me, right now, okay? And see if Celeste is still here! Hey, Jason. Hey. Jason! Can you hear me? Breathe man. [Alyssa] Jason! Shut that door right now! I'm calling 911. - No! - What? - You can't yet. - Why? Can you hear me? Jason? Can you hear me? - [knocking] - It's Celeste! Let me in! Oh, my God! There are too many people in here! - He's gonna die! - He's not gonna die! I'm calling an ambulance. Oh, Brody, you're not calling them. Give me that. Get the fuck out of here! What the fuck is wrong with you people? He's got to get to a hospital! Brody's right! We've got to get him to a hospital! Everybody needs to calm down. I've dealt with this before. I've got this. Everybody calm down. He's gonna be fine. [Interviewer] So, how are you handling everything? I mean, you are everywhere now. Your face is on billboards, magazine covers, it's like it happened overnight. Is that weird for you? It's cool, um, I guess, y'know, I'm not, I'm not sure I like it. It kinda makes me nervous. [Interviewer] You're not sure you like what? Being famous. [soft music] Jason? [heart beating] Jason, can you hear me? Jason? Wake up! - [knocking] - What's going on in there? Open the door! - Oh shit. - Don't open it! - It's his brother! - Open the door! Where's Jason? Hey. Hey, bro. It's me. Jason! - What did you give him? - He was freaking out, so I gave him something to calm him down. What was he on tonight other than coke? - Shit. - Jesus Christ, Dylan, - was he shooting? - What! [Dylan] I don't know. Is there heroin in the house? [Dylan] I'm not sure! So he was doing coke and heroin? You gave it to him, didn't you? - Wait, wait, wait! - It's your fault, Dylan! You killed him! Um, wait! Wait wait wait. [people shouting] Celeste! Wait, wait, come on. No! No, Jason! My brother, he's convulsing. We're in the Hollywood Hills off Laurel Canyon. I need you to send help. Shit! Um, 10969 Mulholland. I am calm! Just hurry! Y'know, I'm just, I'm just really excited about this film. It's really saying something, you know? [Interviewer] I do. But, what I'd really like to talk about is the film you're shooting now and the rumors that have been circulating in the press about you missing days, showing up late to set. You know, I thought we were here to talk about my film that just opened. [Interviewer] We are, but my sources say that you're about to be fired. I thought you might like to address that. I don't. [Interviewer] Okay, and let me ask you this. Is it true that you're about to go into a rehab program? You know what? This interview is fucking done. Fuck you! Fuck this! You can fuck off! [Interviewer] Jason! [heart beating] [siren wailing in distance] [voices chattering indistinctly] [slow, surreal music] [Ryan] Dylan. I didn't give him the heroin. [Ryan] I know. Give me the gun. I'm his brother. I'm supposed to take care of him. You tried to keep him sober tonight and I should've- - Stop, Dylan. Hey. Jason made his own choices, okay? Give me the gun. It should be me. Not him. - I'm the fuck-up. - That's not true. I didn't take care of him. Hey! They did this to him, okay? Hey. Jason acted like he was fine. He was never fine. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Are you gonna let those fucks kill you too? Hey. Dylan, Dylan, Dylan! Look at me. Look at me. [Dylan sobbing] What am I gonna do without him? He... I'm the fuck up. And he's the strong one. He's the strong one. [sobs] Maybe he wasn't. What are you both still doing here? Did you know how bad he was? I didn't know he was using again. Did you see him tonight? I thought it was your job to know. Excuse me? You both need to leave. The press is already here and I have to go out there and make a statement and I don't want them seeing you. Is that seriously what you're worried about right now? I am trying to protect you girls. It is- - Oh, protect us? Did you protect Jason tonight? Did you protect her tonight? What are you talking about? I have been watching her all night. Did you see her with Jack? What happened with Jack? What did Jack do to you? Tell me what happened... Oh, you know exactly what happened because you know who Jack Rossi is. Come on, Caley. You're gonna come home with me. Caley... He did it to me, too. The night that you sent me to his hotel room for that stupid TV show. You're fired. [Phone Answering Machine] Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. Hey. It's Jason. I'm not here right now. Leave a message, and have an awesome day. [tapping] Hey. You know, everyone's gonna wake up today and think they knew who Jason Mast was. They have no fucking idea. They're just obsessed with him, because they think he has everything that they want. I wish everyone could be famous. I wish everyone could get everything that they ever wanted so they could fucking see it is not what they think it is! It is not what you think it is. I know. No, I knew him before anyone even cared who Jason Mast was. He was the only family I ever had. [Ryan sobbing] Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. We're going home. Caley's gonna come with us. [Reporter] One of Hollywood's finest young actors is dead tonight. Film star, Jason Mast, died early this morning at his house in the Hollywood Hills. [Reporter] It's a sad day in Los Angeles as we regretfully report the death of Hollywood royalty, Jason Mast. [Reporter] The cause of his death is still unknown, but the investigation is looking into all possibilities, including suicide. [Reporter] Jason Mast has been most recently linked to Hollywood's newest sweetheart, Heather Hayes. [Reporter] A 911 call came from his Hollywood Hills home at approximately 4:00 am this morning, he was convulsing and apparently having seizures. The call came from his brother, former actor, Dylan Mast. [somber music] [Camera Operator] Camera speed, and we are rolling. [Interviewer] So, Jason, how do you feel about your first Oscar nomination? Well, I'm grateful for the nomination and honored to be amongst some of the most talented people of all time. Um, but, in, in all honesty? I don't think any of this really matters. It, it's not why I do it. [Interviewer] So, wait a minute, are you saying you're not happy about the nomination? Oh, no, no. Not at all. Um. But it doesn't make me better than anyone else. I never wanted the fame, even as a kid. I was just never comfortable with the attention that came outside of the work. I think it's sad that people care more about celebrities than what's going on in the world. [Interviewer] But that's Hollywood. You know how the business works. Oh, I know exactly how the business works. And the business needs to change. [Interviewer] So, then why do you keep doing it? Because I wanted to be an artist. You see artists... Artists are like this lens that we see life through. They help us to think and to feel in a more intense and emotional way. And that's, that's why we fall in love with them. Then we make them famous and turn them into celebrities. The money, the, the greed, the power, uh, the, the lies, that's what kills the artist in us. And, honestly, I think we're all artists. We're all, we're all here to create something. Think about that for a second. You give a, a two-year old a crayon, and a, and a piece of paper, and the kid knows what to do with it. They, they put the crayon to paper and create something. It's a natural instinct. Art comes from the soul. Um, sorry for rambling. I just had to get that out. [Interviewer] Well, I think that was beautifully said. I don't think this is the last we'll be hearing from you. No, definitely not. [Interviewer] I wish you great success with this film. I think you've got a winner.
