BASED ON A TRUE STORY... This is all because of you! You left Yonca all alone. If anything happens to her, you're to blame! Nejat, calm down. How does a great love story turn into a tragedy? How does one hit to the ground suddenly while flying in the sky with happiness? And what kills love most easily? All I asked was Serkan to be around me. Eventually, time has frozen and I'm trapped in the minutes. Keeping the man you love above anything and giving up yourself... Isn't this love? I neither had a job, nor had my close friends anymore. Where are you, Serkan? I feel like something changed. You are leaving the life that I devoted to you. You're giving up on our heaven. Serkan! Serkan! Serkan! Open your eyes! Open your eyes, baby. I'm begging you. Say something please. What have I done? Hello? Nejat? Nejat, come here quickly. Hurry up, Nejat. Serkan isn't waking up. Something happened to him. Hurry up. I smell alcohol. Patient might have taken something. Set up the suction machine. Where... Where is my brother? -His name is Serkan Yılmaz. -You can't see him now. He's in emergency. Where is my brother, you goddamn woman? Listen to me! If anything happens to him, I'll kill you! Did you hear me? I'll kill you! -Yonca? I was worried about you. -Seda. Seda, thank God you're here. -Awful things happened. -It'll be alright Yonca. Calm down. Vildan, how is Serkan? Did they say what's wrong with him? I don't know. They just keep him there. We're just waiting. Sit down, Yonca. Are you okay? -Yonca! -Yonca! -Yonca? -Yonca? Doctor! -Excuse me? Yonca? -Yonca? -Doctor. -Yonca. Excuse me? This could have been our happy family story... but only fairy tales have happy endings. Neither was I as innocent as a fairy princess nor did my husband love me as much as a fairy prince. Yonca, what a startle that was! -That was funny. -I'm soaking wet. -Is it funny to you? -Yep. What kind of joke is this? I'm soaked! Why the hell are you yelling? What the hell? You can't even take a joke. You'll dry out. What's the big deal? I'll show you how to joke. -Yonca, what are you doing? -Joking. -What kind of joke is this? -But it was okay when you did it. -What the hell? This is stupid. -But it's okay when you do it? -You're unbelievable. -What the hell is this? Serkan. -I don't understand why you got mad. -You're acting silly and making me angry. -What did I do? -What? I'm sick, why did you drench me? Don't play that sick card with me, Serkan. If you're sick, stay at home and rest. I'm bored of sitting at home. So, I drove around a little bit. So what? -We could have gone out together. -Yonca, you really wear me out sometimes. You really wear me out. I didn't wake you up since you were tired, and this is what I get in return? You fainted in the hospital the other day. That's why I didn't wake you up. Okay, Serkan. Don't remind me of that night ever again, all right? I was worried that something could happen to you. You got scared and called Nejat, right? Yes. What do you mean? I don't mean anything. I'm just saying that you called Nejat. -Didn't you call him instead of ambulance? -Yes, because I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I was so scared when I saw you like that. You turned pale and suddenly fell. Okay, Yonca. Please enough. I'm alive, all right? Everything is all right. I'm healthy. I'm not dying, okay? Serkan. Don't talk like that. Serkan. You're the only home that I take shelter in. You're the only country that I know. I don't have any other world but you. Promise not to leave me, okay? -Promise me. -Yonca. Stop. Okay. Don't do this. Why would I leave you? Don't talk like that. Let me go. I need to go to work. What are you doing? Yonca. Stop. I recently got out of hospital. I'm not fully recovered. -Yonca. I'm a little chilly, really. -Don't go. -Phone is ringing. -Let it go. It's not important. If it's important they will call again. -I'll get you in the mood now. -But... -Someone is at the door. Gotta get it. -Let them knock. Honey, I was so scared when nobody got the door. I thought something happened. Sister, you're exaggerating. She doesn't even know how to feed you... She had no right to blame me. She used to drug Uncle Rıfat and snoop on his phone, and I did the same thing. He deleted all of the messages. Even my messages are gone. Keep talking, Vildan. Stall Serkan. Did he change the password? Yonca, come down. My sister is here. I'm coming Serkan. Hold on. Which jacket did he wear? This one? I knew he was going to buy me a present for our anniversary. -You see, she doesn't come down. -Yonca, come on. I'm coming, darling. -Don't play with the dog. -Come on, sister. Yonca, I see that leaving your job didn't do you any good. I wonder what are you doing in this big house? Don't you get bored of not doing anything? You know it better than me, Vildan. I've been like this only for a year. You've never worked in your life and always battened on others. -How can you talk to my sister like that? -It's okay. Let her talk. I don't mind. I only laugh at her childishness. Keep laughing, it's very funny. -Everybody knows what is what anyway. -Yonca, enough. Enough already. She came all the way. Go, prepare something to eat. No need. We all need to be careful of what we're eating in this house anyway. -I got to go. -Don't go. Let's eat something. My dear, I'm going for now, but I'll come to check on you everyday. Okay? See you. -Sister, we can eat something together. -I doubt that. -Get out my way. You're everywhere. -You should have stayed more. Come on. Take care of yourself, okay? -Seda, how are you? -Yonca? I'm fine. I was worried about you. Serkan got released from the hospital. Is he okay? He's fine, but I'm not. What do you say for a girls night? I'm very busy this week. Maybe later? -Okay, let's keep in touch. -Is that my phone? -Yes, I'm talking with Seda. -Why do you take my phone? Serkan, wait. I'm talking with my friend. Just leave it. -Seda. -Serkan. How are you? Did you finally find where the kitchen is? Yes, just like you found where the living room is. You could have waited a minute. We'd eat together. I'm starving. I got a little greedy. What were you talking about for so long? You both have become workaholics. This month has been hectic. And there is this project... If I finish that, we can make a killing. If you hadn't want me to leave the job, it could've been easier for you. It was a mutual decision. Is it more important than motherhood? We have been trying for months. There is nothing. Don't worry. It'll be all right. We are fine. Wait. Before the pasta, we'll have a short break for gifts. Okay, I can accept spaghetti Bolognese as a gift. -Ta-da. -What's that? We were not able to exchange gifts in our anniversary. This is a good moment. -Yonca. -Come on, take it. -Yonca. -Open it up. I really wonder if you'd like it. -That's beautiful. -Let's put this on and see how it looks. -Very stylish. Really, that's beautiful. -It looks great on you. -Enjoy it. -Thanks, honey. Now you can pay attention to your watch and will not come home late. Come on. You cannot get away with a kiss. Where's my gift? What gift? Anniversary gift. Haven't we talked about it, honey? We agreed not to buy anything this year. -You're joking. Come on, give it. -Why would I joke? I have no time anyway. -You're just mocking with me. -Why would I? But if you want something, I can give you my credit card. Get what you want. Something you like. Okay? Let's do it like this. Yonca, can you bring that thing... That cheese. I'll put some, come on. Come on, honey. Come on, Yonca. Here, take it. Thank you, honey. We should have talked. But I was afraid. I didn't know what was the worse, listening to the lies, or the truth? Our love was growing every day. When he looked at me, I thought I was the most beautiful woman in the world. What changed? What did we lose? You may not remember the last smile, but you can't forget who made you cry. Yonca. Look... If you doubt Serkan, you should stand up to him. He acts as if I'm paranoiac. I have no time or energy for a fight. Yonca. Are you really avoiding a fight? Or are you afraid of what Serkan might tell? Don't be silly, Nejat. What can he say to make me sad? I'm not afraid of such a thing. I am sure of my husband's love. A message. Going out with friends tonight, dear. I'll be late. Don't expect me to dinner. He's going out with his friends tonight for dinner. So what? I need to be there when he leaves the company. He no longer shares our photos. Taxi. I can't talk to you right now, Nejat. From left. Don't miss it. Seda, Seda, Seda... Come on, Seda. Pick it up. -Hello? -Seda. -Is this a good time? Where're you? -I'm on a business dinner. I can't talk. -Is Serkan with you? -Why would he be? He's with his friends tonight for dinner. My battery is low. It might switch off. Okay. God! Was she telling the truth? Who else was there? What's up, Selim? Where are you guys? Out with the boys. Everyone is here but yours. How? Is he not with you now? Are you kidding? He's become henpecked. He has been making excuses for weeks, running to you after work. How? For weeks? -So, he's not going out with you? -Never mind him. Why did you call? He doesn't pick up. Where're you, Serkan? -He isn't picking up. -Yonca, calm down. -He isn't picking up. -Then, stop calling. Maybe, he can't right now. Don't worry, he'll be back. One way or another, he'll be back. Nejat, I love him so much. -I love him more than my life. You know? -I know, sweety. I know. But you have to talk to Serkan. Just because you love him so much, you can't shut your eyes to everything. -I apologize to you, too. -Why is that? I bored you with my problems. You have your own problems, too. You're trying to raise a kid, all alone. Come on, don't be silly. But, you know what? Without Ferit, I wouldn't know what to do. He's calling. Hello, Serkan. Where are you, honey? The question is where are you? No one is home to open the door. Calm down. I went out for fresh air. What's wrong with that? What are you saying? You have any idea what time it is? Where are you? Who's with you? Nejat is with me. We're having tea on the beach. We're not far away anyway. The same place we used to meet. I'm on the door, waiting. And you're talking about having tea. What shit is that? Come home right away. Okay, don't get mad. We were about to get up. -I'm coming. -Hurry home now. Okay, coming right away. How much is it? Here, thank you. Good night. Come on. -Good night. How are you, Serkan? -A bit tired. Same. -Okay. I won't keep you any longer. -Thanks. -Nejat. -Good night. Look at me. How can you meet Nejat in the middle of a night? God! I wanted to meet him. What's up with that? I've called Selim. So, I haven't let you out for weeks? -Why did you call Selim? Why? -What are you doing, Serkan? Why are you calling our friends? Why do you embarrass me? Stop it! You stink! Have you been drinking? Look, you'll answer me! How can you meet him every time I'm not here? -He's my cousin. Don't be ridiculous. -Bullshit. Cousin? You're not related by blood. He's adopted. I guess, you forgot you're married. You're going out with men. What's this? What happened? Are you jealous? It makes you angry seeing me with someone else? When someone likes me? Adores me? What are you saying? Do you want to play a game? -Do you want to play a game? -Serkan, don't! Then, I'll treat you like a whore. -Serkan, don't. -I can treat you like a whore. Don't. Serkan! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! What happened, Yonca? You were acting like a tough-ass. Not such a big talker now, are you? Just be yourself. You're making a fool of yourself. This is not you. Is this really you? Are you the man I fell in love with? The man I adore. Aren't you the one who pushed me to do this? What are you saying? Is this why you lose yourself and treat me like an animal? I treated you properly. In a way that you want. Okay? I treated you in a way that you wanted! But it was not enough, was it? I wasn't. You can't get your mind out of those wicked fantasies or other people! What are you talking about? You are being paranoid all over again. -What is it with this jealousy crap? -Don't treat me as if I'm mentally ill. -You can't get away from me this time. -Why would I? I'm right here. Then give me an answer. Where were you this evening? God... Do you think you can act like a bitch and question me at the same time? -You're sick. Sick! -Yes, I am sick. I am sick. That's why you are going to tell me. For whom did you buy the butterfly necklace I found in your pocket? Where did you go when you told me you were going out? And, where are you going when you tell me you are going to a business meeting? You will tell me all about that! Enough of that! I cannot deal with a sick, paranoid woman like you! -Enough! -Serkan, where are you going? I'm not done talking to you. -You owe me an explanation. -Explanation? I can explain. Let me break it down for you. I don't want to be home with a psychopath, lunatic like you. Is this a good explanation? Serkan, okay. I'm begging you, don't leave. I'm taking it all back! I'll not ask anything and I won't look through your private things. Wait, where're you going? Serkan? Serkan, please. I'm so sorry. I got a little carried away. Serkan! You son of a bitch! Shithead! Didn't you have the balls to speak up? When you have to face all your lies, you're running away! Please, pick up the phone. We need to talk. Come back home, I'm begging you. Serkan, please. Why don't you turn it off when you're with me? It can't go on like this, Serkan. I'll tell Yonca everything. What are you talking about? I've got a big offer. Do you want to humiliate me in front of everyone? What? Are you ashamed of me? What's that got to do with it? Enough. I am dealing with Yonca at home, and here with you. Where do you think you're going, Serkan? Listen to me. You can call me many things. A homewrecker, vile, whore. But remember that no one intentionally becomes the other woman. The one that is always humiliated, despised, hated. You are the loser even when you win. Wake up! Shameless! Poor girl! Can't you deal with the pain of your break up? Look at me, loser! You attempted suicide but you couldn't, right? If you want to try it again, I can leave now. -How did you get in? -What are you talking about, girl? The doors are open. Knock-knock? Look at yourself. You became miserable after Serkan left you. -What? What are you talking about? -Nevermind! What happens, happens. Serkan sent me to take his stuff. Show me where they are and-- Enough with you! You have been behind us for years! What do you want? I'm not giving you anything! Get out! If every argument ended with a break up, there wouldn't be any marriages. You are an idiot. He dumped you! Can't you understand that? Sure, you got too comfortable in this house. You gave hell to him with all your endless naggings about his girlfriends. -Give me his stuff and I will leave. -I have nothing to give. This is my home, you can't come and go whenever you want! You cannot break families up with your filthy lies! He has been with an another woman for months! Can't you understand that? But you can go on living with your dream love! You don't understand a thing. To hell with you then! Hello, Seda. How are you? Where are you? I was so worried. Sorry. -I don't feel like myself. -I can see that. This morning you called here and swear at everyone not letting you to talk to Serkan. What did I do? How? You were so drunk, honey. The secretary put you on speaker. God, just look at me. Seda, I'm not good. I know, Yonca. That's why we need to talk. I've something to tell you about Serkan. Let's meet at the cafe we always go in an hour. -Okay, sure. -See you there. Kiss. -Hello, Nejat. -Yonca. Are you all right, sweety? You sound terrible. Can you come and pick me up? Yonca, it can't go on like this anymore. You're devouring yourself. You don't realize what you're doing unconsciously. You need help. Look... I have a close friend. He's a good relationship expert. Nejat, am I a lunatic? I don't need any help. Everyone is perfectly sane, but I am the one who is insane? Yonca, it's normal for people to ask each other for help. Besides... When I lost my wife, Mehmet was there for me, helped me a great deal. If I didn't trust him so much why would I insist you? I know what I want. I want my husband. When I work things out with Serkan, all my problems will be solved. Okay? I don't need anyone's help. But thank you anyways, Nejat. Thanks. I have to go. Seda is waiting for me. Take care. Bye-bye. I am all ears, Seda. I really don't know how to say this. This is not easy for me either. On the one hand, you are one of my best friends. On the other hand, so is Serkan. After what I have to say, I don't want you to be upset, or be angry with me. What are you going to say? I don't understand. Okay, I'm gonna keep this short. First of all, I don't want you to humiliate yourself. And I don't want you to put yourself into an embarrassing position like today. Unfortunately, Serkan has a serious relationship. -He's in love with someone else. -Not you, too. Did Vildan say this? Yonca, Serkan told me himself. You know what? Instead of lecturing me, look at yourself. Calm your own wife. You were busted, too. If that damn Necati from the security didn't talk, I wouldn't get caught. Sure. You got busted, man. It's normal for her to get crazy, you messed it up. If you hadn't told her I wasn't with you, I wouldn't have been busted. How could I know? You told nothing. I thought you were going home everyday. I had no idea. If somebody else had told me that you and Seda are together, I wouldn't believe. What were we supposed to do? Hold a sign? Their relationship has been going on for over a year. They even rented a house together. He told me how much he loves her. And how much fun they are having now. I wanted you to hear this from me first. I think, it's ridiculous. Why would Serkan hide such a thing? He still calls me my butterfly. Tells me how much he loves me. That doesn't make any sense. So, what are you planning to do? I really don't know. I don't know, but Yonca has changed a lot, Selim. Really. She became irritable and cranky. Always asking and asking, I can't stand this. Okay, I love her. We're in love with each other, but still. We're thinking about having children. Okay, she's there. But, Seda... Our relationship is quite different. -What we have is sexy. -You can't have your cake and eat it too. Okay, it's a no-win situation, but you'll have to choose one eventually. I know, this is hard to accept. I think you need to stop now. Be strong, Yonca. Have a little dignity. Do the honorable thing. I think you should be the one ending the relationship. What are you saying? What do you mean? I'll only believe that when I see it. And let's say, there's a woman, as you claimed, why would I let go of my husband because of her? Don't be silly, Yonca. Will you please be reasonable? Would you like your husband to have a relationship with another woman in front of everyone? Love? What love? It's just cheap sex. I will not end my marriage for a woman my husband will give up two days later. SERKAN IS CALLING You mentioned that much. Who's she? Gotta go, I'm getting late. No, you can't go anywhere. You'll give the name of that woman. What're you going to do? Are you going to kill her, or insult her? This'll only make you look small, not her. Can you sit down? We're not done yet. I'm done talking. The rest is up to you. What do you mean, the rest is up to me? Seda? Seda? WHO'S THAT WOMAN? Yonca, what the hell are you doing here? You've lost your damn mind now! We'll finish our talk. I'll settle it with you and Serkan. -What Serkan? Serkan is not here. -Serkan! Get the hell out here! Serkan, where are you? We need to talk. -Who am I talking to? -Yonca. -Please, honey. -Who am I talking to? -Uncle, what's wrong? Are you okay? -Get away from my husband. Get out of here or I'll call the cops. And you, get over there. Okay, call them, let them see what you do to this man. Get out of my house! Get out! Go clean up after your husband. What are you saying? I'm saying, go look for your husband in other women's arms! Go! Watch your mouth and stay away from my marriage. You fucking moron! Just wait. I will give you an address. And if you have the guts, go find him there. Yonca? Seda? -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? Do you live here? Yeah, Yonca. I just moved in here. Come on, Yonca, I'm tired. I'll go to bed. Vildan gave me this address. Yonca, it's getting too late. Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Seda, wait. It is you. You're the whore who has seduced my husband. -Yonca, look... It's not... -You're that bitch. Yonca... You filthy whore! Get lost! You bastard! What are you doing, Yonca? NEJAT IS CALLING Yonca please pick up your phone. I'm really worried. Don't worry. I will be fine just like the old days. He's calling again. Won't you talk to Serkan? Not yet. I need to calm down before going back home. What? Are you planning to go back home like nothing happened? Yes. Will I give up so easily? I will fight till the end. Yonca. Please, just pull yourself together. How can you go back to that man after all he has done to you? I cannot live without Serkan. I just can't. You don't realize, but you cannot live with him, honey. When he is living his best life, you're burying yourself alive. Don't. Do you know what love is, Nejat? Do you know what love means? Love is not giving up even for one second. Thinking about him all the time. Staying with him, sleeping with him. Not being able to breathe without him. Do you even know anything about that? I know that very well. Very well. I know what it means... to not give up even though it hurts... even though you cannot be with them. Yonca! I know you're there! Open the door, Yonca! Don't go, Yonca! Please. Yonca! Open the door and talk to me! Yonca! Serkan why did you come here? Please listen to me. -What do you want? -Listen to me. Let's go home. -No, I don't want to. -I'm begging you. -You lied to me. -I didn't lie. I don't even understand. Let's go. Come on. Come home. I'm gonna take a couple days off. We will spend some time together. Come on, my love. -It's always the same. -Come on my love. I'm glad you finally listened to Nejat and came here, Yonca. How are you feeling? Is it permissible to smoke here? Of course. I don't know. I really don't know. It's like my soul left my body... and someone else is living my life. And I watch my own life... from afar. I'm sorry. I know that you're traumatized, Yonca. You've witnessed the relationship between your husband and your best friend. You've lost you faith in both, your husband and your best friend. I cannot accept this. It's only normal that you're confused. But you should remember... that you had a life before Serkan. Exactly. You had friends, a successful career and dreams, Yonca. You and Serkan got married and created a world for two. If Serkan has cheated on you and left you alone, you're not the only one responsible for that. Maybe I should've left. Is it right to share the same house? I am not only losing Serkan's respect for me, I am also losing my own self-respect. I'm so tired. I cannot control anything. Everything just seems to slip away. It's really a big step to even be sitting here... because you have the courage to question what is wrong in your relationship. Do you think so? Maybe if I was really brave, I would take revenge on them. I'd make them pay for what they did. SHOT HIS GIRLFRIEND ENDLESS MURDERS I waited for you to restore my honor which you degraded. If necessary, I'll put you into the same flames that will burn me. Otherwise, my pain will not end. Yonca? I'm in the kitchen. What a nice smell. Welcome. Just in time. Can you pour the wine? Serkan, wait. Why? I've cooked so many things. Aren't you hungry? I'm hungry. Even starving. Okay, then. If you let me, I'll go to the kitchen. There's someone at the door. Who's that? Could be one of the neighbors. -Wait. -Oh, it could be my sister. We'd talked with her today. Like I haven't had that nightmare before. I had planned a romantic night for that evening. I didn't know that there was a surprise waiting for me. How dare you come here? How dare you come here? I told you it was over. Don't you get it? What more do you want? What's happening here? -It's nothing, honey. -What's she doing in our home? Nothing, honey. Calm down. She's leaving. Please leave. Isn't it enough? And you're coming here. You were my friend. I shared my secrets with you. I didn't do anything wrong. Your husband was after me. He seduced me. Cut it, Seda! Enough! Is it that easy, Serkan? You said you can't live without me. I was the love of your life. You couldn't leave me for a second 'til yesterday. You said that you couldn't even breathe. What happened? What has changed? What kind of a miserable woman are you? You aren't welcome here. Get out! This is a family house, not a bachelor's house. "Family house"? You cannot say that for a house in which two people are living a big lie. Wake up, Yonca. Your husband already has a family with me. Yonca? Come on in. Come in. Nejat. I'm having Serkan's baby. It's okay. Calm down. Don't do that. Stop. Stop. Please. Stop. Yonca, stop. She's crazy. Nothing she says is true. She's crazy. Nothing she says is true. She's just angry. She wants to put me in a bad position. Don't do that. Stop. Let's go somewhere for a couple of days. Hello, Uncle Rıfat. I'm outside. Do you want me to call you when I'm home? Help me, Yonca. Please. Vildan locked me in. I cannot go out. I cannot eat anything. She keeps giving me some pills. I am afraid that she will poison me, Yonca. Please, I'm so afraid. She always puts me to sleep. Okay, just hold on. I'll be right there. That way. Here comes trouble. What happened, Yonca? Are you looking for your husband in my house again? I'm here to save Uncle Rıfat from you. Look at me girl... My husband is not your business. If you were a real woman, you could keep your man on a short leash. Don't bother talking. Serkan has chosen me. We're having the best days of our marriage. Do you think so? So funny! You're not going to tear us apart with your filthy words. You've already broken up. What would my brother do with a cheap woman that cannot give a child to him, that spends his money? Of course, he will choose Seda over you. You shameless woman! I'll kill you! I will end your life! You were poisoning my brother! Look at me. I swear, I'll kill you even if you're the sister of my husband. You hear me? I'll kill you. Yonca? Where have you been? Yonca. We will miss the ship, Yonca. I've been waiting for you for an hour. Yonca? What are you doing? Nothing. I'm just sitting here. Yes, Melis? A hospital? Vildan. She's gone, Serkan. She's dead. My sister... You might not like this or you might say that I have a cold heart, but I did not feel sorry for Vildan's death even a tiny bit. I'm relieved, actually. It's like a weight has been lifted from my heart. Yonca why do you hate a dead woman that much? Do you think everything is solved in your relationship with Vildan's death? Yet, it is. With her death, no one will come between me and Serkan. But you're forgetting something. It's Serkan who cheated on you, not Vildan. And he did it intentionally. What do you mean? Does Serkan have to be the father of a fatherless child of a whore? Can you calm down, Yonca? If we can't talk about problems realistically-- There is nothing to talk anymore. There is nothing to talk about. I love my husband. And my husband loves me. That's all. No one can break us apart. Not you, not Seda, nor that Vildan! Do you understand me? No one can come between us anymore. That's enough. Yonca, where are you going? Our session is not over yet. Hello, Nejat. Where are you, Serkan? Hello? Gamze. Hello, ma'am. -Can I speak to Serkan? -He's not here. How? Didn't he come to work today? He's on annual leave. What are you doing, Yonca? Sitting there in the dark. Like a horror movie. I was ringing the doorbell. Why didn't you open it? You could've cooked something at least. Why? Are you hungry? Didn't your bitch made you something? You could've eaten something after going shopping. What are you talking about, Yonca? I was working till now. Well done! You were working. Congratulations! Didn't they choose you as the employee of the year? Working on an annual leave is a huge success. What are you talking about, Yonca? You've been nagging me since I arrived. You've become paranoid. Am I paranoid? -Yes, you're. -Yes. I am paranoid. -Yes! -What are you then? You are an asshole. So low that you go baby shopping with a woman that you said you won't see again! You're going to that whore and saying that you're going to work. Are you following me? Are you following me? What the hell is that? All that questioning. Enough, Yonca. I've had it up to here. Are you sick? -You made me like that! -What are you doing? You sow seeds of doubt into my heart with your lies. You humiliated us. You humiliated us by going into the arms of that whore. -Enough. -It's not! It's not! Get the fuck out of this house. Get out! Yonca, pull yourself together. Get out! -You are sick. -I said get out! I couldn't reach Serkan for three days. He did not pick up his phone. I haven't said my last word yet. I will give you an unforgettable goodbye gift. My love. My dear love. I couldn't reach you. I know. I've always loved you more than you've loved me. I know. I accept that. Maybe you were right and I was the one who was wrong. Now you've left me. I cannot bring you back. I ask for one last thing before leaving you. Let's have dinner together tonight. Please don't refuse. For our beautiful past. Come for your butterfly that you said you loved once. Please. Don't worry, my love. We won't see each other after tonight. I will say goodbye to you for the last time. Please don't make me wait. Meet me at home after 8:00 pm. WOMAN WHO KILLED HER HUSBAND GETS 20 YEARS WOMAN WHO HAD A BREAKDOWN KILLED HERSELF AT HOME BLOOD-CHILLING MURDER YONCA YILMAZ MOBILE Pick up, Yonca. Pick up. NEJAT SAĞLAM MOBILE Don't be silly. Hello? Nejat. Do you have Yonca's address? We should talk to her. Now. Okay. I will call the babysitter and come. Okay. -Open your mouth. -Dad! "Dear Nejat, you were always there for me. And supported me all along. I'll not be around for some time. Time for me to go. Wanted to say bye." Yonca, I hope you wouldn't do such a thing. Come here. Let's go to your room. Goodbye, my love. I'm gone. This is my last gift to you. This is all because of you! You left Yonca all alone. If anything happens to her, you're to blame! Nejat, calm down. Yes? Good evening. This is Küçükyalı Police Station. Are you Serkan Yılmaz? Yes. It's me. This is about your sister's death. Your brother-in-law was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He pushed your sister out the balcony. My brother-in-law? You must come to the police station. Officer, I... I am at the hospital. Can I come tomorrow morning? Okay, we will be waiting. Thanks for informing me. Doctor? How is she? We have a critical 48 hours ahead. We will wait. But we have lost the baby. I'm sorry for your loss. "Baby"? Yes, results show that she was pregnant for one and a half months. I'm sorry for your loss. Excuse me. Just like the transition of seasons... my love transitioned from a caterpillar to a butterfly. But instead of flying, it surrendered to the sleep of love. I flapped my wings for so long. Now, I'm weary and exhausted. My sleep of love ended. He would never love me like I've loved him. I had to kill the old Yonca to accept that. Now, the butterfly was gone. It was the day that I had risen from my ashes. No one sees the new beginnings in the ends. I've learnt how to beat my pride, to regain it, and to embrace love. You reap what you sow in life. Those who do not give up on loving, write their own happy endings in the end. Those who sow seeds of doubt can only reap frustration. They never appreciate what they have. Those who sow fear and lies lose touch with reality by getting trapped in their own lies. Those who sow patience and devotion get a friendship that lasts a lifetime. Yonca's Recovery Journal When you anchor in true city of love, you just want to settle there After all, love is like a butterfly That lasts a day for those who fail to appreciate it And a lifetime for those who consummate it.
