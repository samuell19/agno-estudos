Ricky! What, aunt Serena? -Look, new neighbors. Come on! Funny hair. It looks like noodles. Noodle head! You can get a new friend in her. Oh no! Poor Mr. Lindberg! How could I cheer him up? ''Dear Mr. Lindberg.'' Too ordinary. Ricky, how should l start my letter to Mr. Lindberg? Write: ''Hi, my friend downstairs.'' He's more than a friend to me. Put: ''Hi, more than a friend''. Sounds better. l could write: ''Hi, my friend downstairs who is much more than a friend.'' Should l say ''neighbor''? ''Hi, neighbor who is much more than a neighbor.'' ''l saw you drag your heavy bag and l felt sympathy.'' ''You are strong and sensitive.'' ''Your high forehead reftects intellect- and your full lips are an artistic entity.'' ''Dare l suggest we meet?'' ''Looking forward to your reply, your age mate upstairs.'' What do you think, Ricky? -lt's fine. Perhaps it's too bold. You could take the new neighbors a slice. Some pie to welcome them to our building. -You go. They have a girl your age. You don't have to say anything. Butterfly... A funny last name. ''Your high forehead reftects intellect.'' ''Your full lips are an artistic entity.'' ''Looking forward to you reply...'' He's nuts! You are not an artistic entity... Hot Lips! Hurry up! What? What? Hot Lips? My letter was in the basket. Have you seen it? l took the pie in it. The letter got into wrong hands! They think l wrote it to them. What letter?. -The one l wrote! It was in here. A love letter! What did it say? -Sensitive things. I even suggested a date. And signed it ''your age mate upstairs.'' Where's my apron? -We'll be late for the taping. Mom, there was a strange kid in the hallway. There are hot dogs in the fridge. He brought us rhubarb pie and a letter. -We'll talk later. I miss my oId home I saw a crack willow from my window I miss the squirrel in my oId home A child should not be moved to a new home A child belongs to the oId home A child is not happy in a moving van A child does not want new friends OId ones are much nicer I miss my oId home Where I looked at the full moon from behind the curtains I miss the magpie in the oId yard A child must not be transported to a new home They read it. Mr. Lindberg? -No, the girl. ''You are not an artistic entity.'' -Don't read it out loud! How nasty! But at least they don't think l wrote it. They think l did! Go tell her you wrote it to Mr. Lindberg. l can't do that! It was just a draft. l can never go out again. Of course you can. We'll think of something. Don't worry, we'll disguise you. This is good! Let's see if anyone recognizes you. You'll need a new name. Hi, Serena.And Ricky. -Not Ricky, but... Hector Ditch from staircase A. It's a girl. Nice to meet you. Should I ask her for coffee? l should get going... Cool jacket. What? -Do you play? Yeah, drums. -Come to rehearsals some day. Okay. Hey Hot Lips! Hi. -What's your name?

Mom's hair is too high. She recognized me right away! -How can that be? Dad's overdoing it again. Mix the dressing from oil... Give me the other one. Bring me my high-heel shoes, the red ones. Aunt Serena! You should go out. -l don't want to. You haven't been out in two days. Can you at least water the plants? There's no food. -Go to the supermarket. HOT CHILI SAUCE Smells delicious. Spicy! How come this place is such a mess? This is hopeless. We're drowning in filth. We'll make it. I'll call Fanny. Who's Fanny? -My cousin from Coupon Street. The first on the left, with braids. Is she a good cook? -Yes, yes. She was the fastest freezer in the hospital kitchen. Talk to me. - This is your cousin Serena, hi. I broke my leg and nobody cooks for the boy. Is he loud? -Ricky? No, he's a very quiet boy. You need practical help. I'll come over, right away. It's overflowing! Excuse me? -Overflowing! l can see the trash. Learn to bag it properly. Hide the drum. Open the door! Open up! Your shirt is loose. Tuck it in. Hi, Fanny! Nice to see you. Where did that awful drumming come from? -Downstairs. l know it came from here. Was it you? No. I'll find that drum! -But... Ricky loves music. -Let's put his musicality to test. Freezing and starving, fighting in the Balkans...Sing it, Ricky. Freezing and starving, freezing and starving No ear for music. -Try again, Ricky. O precious fatherland, sweet home Finland in the north There is no country dearer to me You can do it! Sing.

The girl, Noodlehead. -You could invite her over. Never! l can't be friends with a girl. Depends on the girl. Wrte to her. -What? Write a letter and you will be liked. You'll get friends and influence. Boo. Letters and so on, letters and so on... -No! A noisy nuisance. Go on, write to her. -No. Then she'll never know that you're nice and talented. And a good drummer. ''Hi. l don't usually write to girls.'' ''Hi, I'm usually quite ordinary.'' No. ''Hi, I'm usually easy to talk to.'' No! ''Hi, let me send you a letter.'' ''Hi, downstairs neighbor. I'm not Hector who was under the carpet.'' ''I'm not writing a letter and I'm not Hector.'' ''The guy in the sunglasses was Hector Ditch, not me.'' ''Regards, Ricky. Who is not Hector.'' Ricky, time to take a bath! Well? -Yeah... I'll confiscate this noisy thing. -Aunt Fanny took my drum! I'll put the drum on the shelf, for good. I'll be gone for two hours every day. Don't make a mess. We have to obey or she'll go away. Noodle head... Separate the egg yolks. Beat the egg yolks and sugar until foamy. Then beat the egg whites until the foam thickens. Whites? First it was yolks. l forgot my key. -Ricky is taking a bath. I'm watching TV Butterflies. Whites or yolks first? Beats the whites into an even, shiny foam. You can wait in Ricky's room. -l thought he was Hector. Strain the flour to avoid lumps. Put the cake pan in the fridge. ''The guy in the sunglasses was Hector Ditch, not me.'' ''Regards, Ricky. Who is not Hector.'' Ricky Rapper!

Shall l bring you your Moomin shirt? No! Bring me my Batman shirt. And pants. And tell her to leave! Let's leave Ricky to dress. Why is Ricky Hector at times? -He couldn't be Ricky. Why? -Because you thought he wrote the letter l wrote. It was accidentally put in the basket he brought to you. It was meant for someone else, but l can't tell you more. Ricky was afraid you'd laugh at him, so he dressed up as Hector. It's Nelly. Can l come in? -No. Would you come to our place sometime? Would you? -Tomorrow? Sure. Okay. There's a boy your age here.
