Jagruti Trust. From children to farmers... - it treats everyone in Anantapur like a mother. - Old age homes... orphanage homes... free education and medical treatment... it's helping people by providing free services in many ways. Most importantly, around 1500 farmers are surviving by... by doing agriculture on the thousands... of acres of land around this trust. Mr. Narayan Rao, trustee. This trust is run by their family... since many generations. He looks after everyone's need. One person has laid his eyes... on this trust land which is spread... across thousands of acres. Vikram Sarkar. Irrespective of the party in power, he plays with them like circus. His business is run across five states. Sarkar's present target is Jagruti trust. He secured permission by the government to set up a factory... by tying up with a German company. Sarkar's share in this deal is around 5,000 crores. By taking advantage of a minor loophole... in trust registration papers... he created fake documents in his name. In order to get hold of the trust... he has to either compensate the public or usurp it with authority. Sarkar preferred the second option. Sir, what is all this? You're educated, right? Read it. Sir...sir, there is some kind of forgery in it. Many people depend on this trust. Farmers are living by depending on the... thousands of acres of land around it. Sir, don't play with their lives. One works hard to make progress. I cheat my opponent. I'm a bad man. We'll go to the court. Go, go! Get away! Sarkar! Sarkar instilled fear in the public in short time. After checking the MRO's verification certificate and documents... legally the trust and its properties... belong to Vikram Sarkar. Stop! Stop! Stop! Court doesn't need your weeping and tears, it needs evidence. Do you have any evidence... to claim this trust? Yes, sir. In 1940... Mr. Arikipurdi Rangaraju... has donated this trust and land to us. Their successors must be... having the original documents. If you give some time... we'll submit you the original documents... related to the trust. Okay, we're giving one month's time. By next month February 5th... this court will come to you again. If you carry the original documents of this trust... then this trust and its land will belong to you. Yeah! Anyway... Mr. Narayan Rao, I'll be there before every move you make. Wherever the successor be in the map... he won't stay alive. Our aim is greater than your hope. Wherever the successor be, we'll find him. SUPREME... He'll definitely land you on the given date. Yes, nobody can touch our hero. Because even the signal lights salute his speed. Supreme is cruising to the airport. - Is Supreme hero's name? - No, it's the name of the car. - What is hero's name? - It's a very common name. - Balu. - Oh! He has reached the airport ten minutes in advance. - I'm unable to wait, reveal the hero. - Is it? Airhostess girls, please move aside. - Yes, he's the hero. - He's very handsome. Though not like a costly apple... but he's cute like a guava which everyone can afford. Hot heroine has made her entry. - How will the hero recognise the heroine? - See there. - You're searching for hero? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. - Sure? - Yes. There! Pose is nice! Freeze it and show the title! Our hero left for the location with the heroine. Sir! I'm a taxi driver... - but became director after wearing your hat. - Thank you so much... for sending your friend to pick up the... heroine after our car broke down. - Your friend will come at the right time, isn't it? - Yes. But sometimes he gets late by two, three hours. Two, three hours? We can go to Vijayawada by then. If someone blows horn from behind when my friend is driving... then he'll get disturbed. He'll keep his work aside... and will show horror movie to the person honking. Blow horn! I got MLA ticket for the first time. I'm getting late for nomination. Had we left one hour early then we would've reached by now. - What did the astrologer say? - What do I know? He said we'll lose deposit if we leave before the auspicious time. Who is the auto guy?

Brother, he has even fitted a drill machine. He's coming towards us. Go back! Doesn't he have a family? Why is he hitting us? He's hitting us. Make a U-turn. He's there-- We're hit! Why are you dancing by leaving the steering? Hold it! Bye! Opposition guy is saying bye to us! People play football with legs. Why are you playing with car? I've written a quotation saying not to blow horn. Will you not follow it? Write quotations on Facebook, we'll follow them. Do we play harmonium instead of blowing horn on road? Last item! He's has disturbed us. We should disturb him. Go and destroy him! Why is he dancing when asked to beat? - Ouch! - What happened? Why did you shout like that? Brother, it missed by a whisker. Ah! Hey, do sit-ups! Come on! Dear, why are you doing sit-ups with head? How should I do with this huge body? Leave now! Hold on! Dear, we should give a message to the society through you. Message?

I'll remove my moustache even if one person claps on the set. Hey, you! Come! Come! Did you like him? More than me? I'm finished! Sound! Moustache! Moustache! Solved! Fake moustache? I didn't like the blood design. - Father! Father! - You... What happened, father? - What is this? - Brandy. - What is that? - Pepsi. Will a person mix Pepsi instead of soda in brandy? That's why I beat! Why don't you mix soda instead of breaking your head? He bit my hand for mixing soda yesterday. Venkatesh... Don't complain against me. Talk about my talent too. You'll feel bad if I say but... will a person make paintings with forks? Don't underestimate any skill... Matchbox...soap piece... Fork brush... Correct! Painting is an art, right? It's called art if it's done on road or board. But is it art if one... pierces... What is this drawing? I thought of drawing a monkey but it turned out to be a pig. Pig? Where is the tail? Right! I'll draw now! - Hey! Stand there! - Hell with you! Rascals don't respect the artists. - Who will pay the bill? - How much? 5,000. - It's 10,000. - Who will pay the previous bill? - Father, father, sit. Please! - Do it. - Pour. Serve him!

I said okay when they offered me 10 rupees... for donning Krishna's get up. They've made all the arrangements. Hail Krishna! They taught me the trick. What is the trick? Open your mouth. Bless me, Lord. Lord... Krishna has dark complexion... but the foolish public started donating money. It is cheating, so I told the truth. Pubic beat them... and they chased me to beat. You got 10 ten rupees for not telling the truth, right? I can't tolerate to see my citizens suffer in my rule. Hey Rajan, which is your kingdom?

Sridevi, I felt happy as you became SI... and have sold them the market for 10 lakhs. I told you to go to the station and sign... but you've spoiled the entire plan by going to the market.

Brother, we've Shankar Goud's work to do first, right? Why are you interfering when your boss is talking? Jenny, it is only with me. Situation is the same in every state. Keep the staff under control. Everyone comes only after Biku. First my work. Vikram Bhai, I've already entered Hyderabad. Search the entire city... but catch him alive. - Balu! - Yes? Sir, please help. Madam...please madam. Madam, girl is suffering from heart disease. Madam... Madam, girl needs heart operation. Please sir. Offer some help.

Why did you call him home by saying I've agreed for marriage? I didn't call him to get him married to you by offering him sweet. It's to kill him. I've added poison in the jaggery. So will you kill? Kill? Are we stabbing him with knife or shooting him with gun? He died with food poison, not a big deal. Entire family will go to jail if it becomes a case. Is he a Commissioner... to jail us by conducting inquiry if he dies? After all a cab driver! It'll get published in some corner of district news. How come you don't manage this small thing? I don't like this plan. Okay, no need. He'll come and show everything to the Commissioner and media. We both will land in jail by noon and... - your family will end up on streets. - No! - Dear! This cannot happen. Everyone be patient. Kishore's idea of poison in jaggery... is the protection to our Bellam family. Uncle! Uncle! - Uncle...Sri...Me... - My God! - Can't speak! - Can't speak? Try, you'll speak. I liked only Sridevi till now. I like the entire Sridevi family now. Enough! Come and eat sweet pudding. No, uncle. My stomach is full. Hey, plan will go waste. - What plan? - I mean... Sweet pudding will go waste. Son-in-law, sweet pudding. - I'll eat lemon rice. - It isn't mixed. - What isn't mixed? - Love, affection and care. By mixing everything... - Sridevi has prepared this for you. - Self-made. Sridevi...you...for me... Uncle, I'll eat this even if there is poison in it. - Is the matter leaked? - Who knows? Uncle, for giving this good news... - you should eat first. - Dear! Why did she react like that as if I'm giving poison? I mean I've sugar, she's afraid that something might happen to me. You eat, you eat. - What about you, Kishore? - Trying for six pack. - Okay. You eat, you eat. - Coffee! - You! Hey, add two spoons in his coffee. - Uncle... - What dear? Actually I... I want to eat if Sridevi feeds me. - Is it? You feed him. - I won't. Feed him! It is his last wish. - Last wish? - I mean... Naughty wish! One minute. Family photo is superb! Let me introduce myself to everyone. - Hi aunt. - Hi. - Hi elder aunt. - Hi. Why do we need this introduction now? What is this torture for us before... - eating one spoon of sweet pudding? - Stop it! - What? - Who called him? - How can we miss him for such important occasion? Sridevi... Are you ready to get married when I asked you to find the car? We don't know anything about your car. - Did he ask? - I thought he might ask. Hello taxi guy! Who is the reason behind this proposal? - Your car. - So who should eat the sweet pudding? You! You! Is he a Commissioner so that we get jailed... after conducting inquiry if he dies? Sweet pudding! I love it. Sir, sir, sir, I've got other delicious dishes prepare for you. Why do you ask me to eat useless food... - when there is sweet pudding here? - Sir, you've crossed 50. - You'll have sugar problem, don't eat. - I've eaten... - sweet pudding as an infant. - Sir, sir... My God! Look, he's eating like a cow. Stop, sir. Don't eat. What will happen to us now? Two of our family members should get... admitted in hospital with him... so that there wouldn't be any doubt. - Me? - You gave the idea. right? - What about the other person? - Me? - You've executed it, right? There! There! I'm saved! - Is the officer safe? - Feeling better, sir. Not you, rascal! I'm asking about the Commissioner. - He is out of danger. - Coffee! Oh my God! Did you bring him here? Doctor's report says poison is mixed in sweet pudding. If this is given to Commissioner like this... Janaki! Bring saline bottle. Hail the son-in-law! You're the son-in-law to our Bellam family from today. - Father! - You shut up! Son-in-law, you should get us out of this trouble. Sir, there is no problem in sweet pudding. If you eat sweet pudding on empty stomach... then chances of food poisoning is there. I've been eating since my birth, but it never happened to me. - We didn't mix poison. - Did he ask? I thought he might ask. - Sridevi. - Sir? Avoid poison in your marriage food. - Okay, sir. - Sir, we're fixing the marriage date this month. May you eat sweet pudding! Is this sweet pudding something great... that you're carrying with you all the time? Doctor! On behalf of the government... all clearances are given to the Vikram Sarkar's factory. We're going to issue the orders soon. Now nobody can stop Vikram Sarkar. By the way, Vikram Sarkar is going to win in the court. You'll come to know about all the information within few days. - Thank you. - Greetings. - Hari? - Expecting your arrival... confidence to live... is getting less every day. You'll come, right? Tell me! - Tell me! Tell me! - Tell me where he is. You don't do captaincy. Showing off? We came to know that the guy we are... looking for is visiting this bar. - Where is he? - Sir, the person whom you're... - searching for doesn't visit this bar. - True, sir. I mean there are two, three bars with the same name. Sir, I've got confused. Rascal... I'm non-local, you're local. How can you get confused? No confusion! I want him! Don't know on whom father made painting on. Your father didn't come. Think he got drunk and fell down somewhere. Didn't come? Hey! Hey! Sir, one aged person... Didn't see. Sir, did you see a 50 years old man? Where did he go? Did you search all the bars in town? You're sweating. Now your father won't drink. My age told me to become a drunkard if you lose. His age told me to get up if I fell down. What's up? You're working hard. For taking more money from my son? Hey old man! I work for food. I don't eat food like you without working. Do you suffer from BP and sugar? No! You're physically fit, right? But mentally not. Your son can put his hand on heart and say... you are a hero. Can you say by keeping your hand here? That you are a hero. You're a bad father. I thought we can forget the past if we drink one night. Just now I've realised that... we can make my son's life better... if I stay awake one night. Today is the happiest day in my life. I've seen my father the way I wanted to see. All this happened because of you. I can't tolerate to see my citizens suffering in my rule. Hey Rajan! - 10 rupees! - Do you want 10 rupees for this too? Want 10 rupees? - Stop! - What sir? Gave us two watchman posts at ATM. What is this posing as if it has changed our lives? Rajan! Rajan!

Thousands of my men around, nobody can come here. - Food bill is 2,500... - Hey! - Diesel bill 10,200. - Are you mental? - Total bill... - I said I'll give you 100 crores. Don't engage in cheap discussions like food and cheap bills. Don't engage in cheap discussion! Old man! - Hello! - Foreign company people are torturing me here. First ask the boys where the documents are. Bury him there after that. - Don't worry, he's alright. - Thank you, sir. Who took the child away? Who are they? If you give us little time... We give you one month's time. We've tried everything possible in searching the successor. As they belong to the royal family... so after checking the entire records of their mansion... Rajaram from third generation in that family... has settled in UK. We got his number through Facebook. Hey! Sunny! Happy birthday! - Hello! - Greetings, sir. Sir, I'm speaking from Anantapur. Mr. Narayan Rao, documents are found. When we were forgetting our roots completely... by telling a great matter about our grandfather... which we were unaware of... you've reminded us our responsibility. This isn't our property, it belongs to you. You don't worry, I'll come personally and... - submit the documents in the court. - Thank you, sir. Mr. Rajaram said he'll come here... but he didn't reach India even after four days. Therefore I went there. After meeting the injured son of Rajaram in hospital... I came to know the actual matter. That Sarkar is ahead of me. Mr. Rajaram, how can you talk of honesty, goal and public nowadays? Straightaway I'm giving you 2,500 crores. - What do you say? - Please get out! You're putting your life in danger unnecessarily. My life is not important... than 1500 lives. Okay. Sarkar! We're from royal family. King's family. I can't tolerate to see my citizens suffer in my rule. That's great, Your Highness. Happy journey. That's a wonderful sight! What say! Hey! Mom! Dad! - Dad! - Ah! Sunny... You've to go to India with these documents. Dad! Dad! Let's go to India. It isn't good to go to India in this situation. Your life is important... than our need now. I can't tolerate to see my citizens suffer... in my rule. Come on, let's go. Documents... We met our MP in Delhi... to ask for security to the child. You've to provide security to the child at any cost. I feel proud of the child. He took a big risk for his age. Wait for a minute outside. - I'll take care. - Tell MP. Rajaram's son is alive. Narayan Rao came to me with the kid. I was talking about your security. We shouldn't trust anybody until we produce... the documents and child on 5th February... in Anantapuram court. You've taught us a great lesson! Thanks a lot! You've challenged Vikram Sarkar. Anyway, what will you achieve with this fair skin lad? Maybe my skin is white... but my blood is Indian. After escaping from there... we were attacked by Vikram Sarkar's henchmen. Sir, they're coming. - Child, you be here, I'll be back soon. - Okay. Let's go. I diverted them and took them outside in order to save the child. Train has left by the time I returned and so I missed the child. Child! Both myself and the child have decided... to be in Anantapuram at any cost. That's why he must have left you. - 10 rupees! - Advance 10 rupees! 10 rupees! - Rajesh, what is the far to Anantapuram? - 500-600 rupees. 72 hours, two rogues... 8 years old kid. Four page documents, 1500 lives. It's very difficult to settle this score. The child who has nobody... Who said that the child is alone? He's got a father here, and a brother there. Only my son can... settle your score. Balu, only a soldier fights for the... public without any selfish motive. Little soldier has started the war, you continue it. You ferry many passengers... in your taxi every day. Bring this little passenger... to Anantapuram at any cost. Where is the child? I know Biku came from Orissa but don't... know where he stays in Orissa. Tell me where the documents are. My sweet boy! My cutie! Tell me! Good boy! Shivam, take this doll outside and open it. Documents are inside...Oh! Why are you interrupting me? Anyway, how come documents enter inside Iron man? Did they manufacture it by keeping them inside? Shivam, break his hands and legs but documents... Jenny, I don't see fear in his eyes. Oh! You think the guy... who helped you that day will come? This is my area. He cannot come here easily.

Daddy would be with me on every birthday. Balu is my best friend. It's been four hours since he escaped from Biku. Even if the average speed is 120... by now he must have entered Andhra border. Sir, I've already entered AP border Konavalasa. Check every taxi that passes by. In whichever car you see an 8 year old boy... - don't leave. - Okay, sir. Use the brain. Use the gun. Catch the damn child! - Check the car behind. - Sir, boy's photo is downloaded. Very good! Go and check. 8 year old kid. In whichever taxi you find, don't leave. Check the white taxi. - It's amazing. - Zing! Zing! Hey taxi bro! Tom-Cruise? - Who are you? - I'm a driver. I'm a cleaner. You don't look so with your dresses. We're owners. - So who are they? - They're also owners. Four owners for one car? When one state has so many policemen... then won't one car has four owners? - You're amazing! - Zing! Zing! - Move the car! - Okay, leave. Go, go. - Clear out. - Sir, there is a kid in that car. - Hey, stop that vehicle! - Stop! Stop! Rajan down! Show the boy. Boy? I hate men badly. Anyway, we have a baby girl. - What do you say? - Hmm. - Okay, show the girl. - Sweetie. What's your name, baby? - Anushka. - Anushka? Sir, I'm a big fan of Anushka. Leave Anushka and her car, sir. - Okay, leave. - Bye, Anushka. Bye my dear fan. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - All cars kidnapped! - It's amazing. Hey, our cars! Gone sir! It's amazing! Zing! Zing! Police officer has called up. They've escaped from them too. Another 8 hours. Only 8 hours are left for the time given by the court. Why don't you rest for some time? I cannot sleep for another 8 hours. Hope nothing happens to the boy. I'll take the boy to Anantapuram even by risking my life. There is nobody to feel sad for me other than my father. If something happens to me then he'll become a son to my father. There is one more person who feels sad... for you other than your father. Today is the judgement of Jagruti Trust... Jagruti Trust.
