Gerti Ober Recorded on Klangfilm equipment But Hansen, you yourself were in the circus. lt would take me three years to train a horse like that. Not just for the circus. Our horses are known everywhere. Hello, Urbini. Well then, old lion tamer. . . . . .returning to the homeland? Tell me, how much is this horse? The horse? For you, nothing. Because my Bessie isn't for sale. This cigar needs a shot of whisky. Let's have it! Right away, caballero! You want to play with me? Okay, let's go. You call that playing? Wait and see! You have no luck today, my friend! l've developed a new dressage routine with the horses, for my big European tour, you know. The horse's price is no object. l send you my thoughts, over there, to the old country. . . Let's allow ourselves a glass. Very well! l'm just checking if it's cool enough. First l have to try the routine in a small village. But if that works, this could be a sensation. Where do you want to start? ln your country, in Norway. ln Norway? Now, in the middle of summer, and at the end of autumn, we'd go back down to Germany. . . -France. -ltaly. Hansen knows the route, doesn't he? And how! The belle epoque of the circus! Sing something else! What's bothering him? lt's been 20 years since he's returned, but this comes over him sometimes. Ah, homesickness! -Urbini! -Yes? -You can have Bessie. -But. . . -Go get her. -What? Go get her! So. . . you're starting off for Norway? When do you want to leave? ln eight hours. Aboard the California. So, another whisky? lf l were you, l'd write them. Write them! After twenty years! My brother-in-law wrote me long ago that he would disown me. My brother-in-law, over there, in Norway. Consul Bernick. -Hurrah! -Hurrah, hurrah! Let's unveil the sculpture. As the sculpture will be unveiled shortly and depicts our celebrated fellow citizen, let me repeat again. lt would be an ingrate who forgets what we owe the man who gave us this hospital. For Consul Karsten Bernick, our own Karsten Bernick, hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Dear fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen. l'd like to say only a few words. Your gratitude is a great honor, but what l've done for you is nothing. Nothing compared, if l may say it, to the benefits someone else will give to you someday, if, as l hope, the work of my life, the Consul Bernick Shipyard, becomes the biggest shipyard in the country. And that ''someone else'' is none other than my son Olaf. -You can be proud of your father. -He's a great model for you. Very well. . . With these words, let's all apply ourselves to the task. -Too bad that Betty wasn't here. -Yes. You know my wife - the excitement gave her a headache. Hello. You're coming tomorrow night, my dear Vigeland ? You'll make your speech. Sandstadt, you'll talk about the town. Good day. Excuse us, we have to talk. Don't worry about us. Later. The events of tomorrow night. . . should be the occasion for a few drinks. Bernick can thank me for his funding. -Me too. -Here we are! Those fellows from the Gazelle! lf that old boat is left in port, they'll scrap it altogether. Tomorrow Bernick will get my four-mast boat to resurface. That'll bring in more for him. You'll see, the Gazelle will be finished soon. -Amazing, this Bernick! -40 beds! -Good clean beds! -With good sheets! Paid for by Bernick! He should give us our pontoon! Because of this shipyard, we have to fight the reefs. Somebody should go speak to the consul. He'll help us! The people are never content. lmpossible to satisfy them. The crab is excellent. For the people, building the biggest shipyard in the country means nothing. lt's the destiny of great men to be misunderstood. Excellent! How they love you, Papa! This is nothing, they'll love you still more. Me ? Why? You'll be much richer than l, basically. Then l'll buy myself the lndian outfit that l want so much, since you won't buy it for me. You and your lndian stories. Come in. At your service, Consul. Does the Consul want to buy an lndian outfit for his son? lt's not for me! This white face will become a redskin. But if you charge too much, old flatfooted lndian, your scalp will bake in the sun. lf mother sees you like that, she'll need her medicine! Dina! -Yes, Madam Consul? -Do you have my medicine? l have one of my headaches! Some cologne water? l have no idea what to do first. l have to plan the party and l haven't even received my dress. But, Madam, the reception is tomorrow. But for the alterations, afterwards? The Consul isn't there, and this newspaperman. . . Oh, what a headache! Go tell the dressmaker to hurry. Where to start, with all this bustle? What an outfit! lnto your wigwam, miserable squaw! Hugh the Paleface has spoken. Look, Dina. l have my Sioux outfit. That's very nice, Olaf, but Aunt Dina doesn't have time. No one saw you? -Why? -You have to set an example here. l was right, Mother needed her medicine. Get out of here, rascal. A gentleman is waiting for you, Karsten. -Who is it? -Hammer, the writer. Hammer? He's here at the appointed time. Mr. Hammer, please. -You've asked me to come? -Yes, l took that liberty. l took the liberty of asking you to come see me in order to learn why my project displeases you. Please. lf you're speaking of my article, it contains the answer to your question. Really? Really? Am l that stupid, then? You're too intelligent to ignore that the population of our city can't be confused with the minority who will profit from the expansion of the shipyards. The city is one-third fishermen and one-third merchants living off the fishing trade. l know. You must acknowledge that the fishermen will drag the entire town down with them when they are ruined. Or have you never thought of that? Look, the fishermen are returning to the port, before the shipyards block it. Now, they have to struggle with the reefs, which tear their nets, which take away their catch and make them injure themselves. Consul Bernick! Mr. Vigeland asks if the Gazelle is nearly finished. He wants us to resurface his four-mast boat. The four-mast is obviously more important to me than that old boat. A delegation of fishermen is here. lt seems that you told them to come. Very well. l can't say when the Consul will arrive. But, Mr. Krapp, he promised to help us. Must we then die of hunger? lt's okay, my good men, come back later. l'll speak to Consul Bernick. What rabble! They're right, Deputy. The solution is to blow up the reef. We could expand the shipyards, the fishermen would be able to navigate. Who'll pay for the demolition? The construction already costs enough. You're good for nothing. You're still living in the Middle Ages. Progress is the watchword of today. The Bernicks have always built boats. Do you know what's bringing to this city the biggest shipyard in the country? Who will build it, except me? And you criticize my work, young man? You're mistaken. l've always valued your work, your energy, your knowledge, but. . . But. . . Go ahead! But l've always regretted that. . . excuse me, in the course of your success, you've always neglected your fellow beings. You say that to me. . . who has worked for 20 years, who has sweated blood and tears, worked day and night for this effort, for the public good and. . . for your son. May your. . . private opinions, Herr Writer, be praised. But you will refrain in future from expressing yourself publicly about my projects. What are you trying to say? Otherwise l would have to ask your editor to aspire. . . to find more progressive writers or to find another chief shareholder. l presume then that l'll no longer be working at the local paper. You stand up for your viewpoint, l mine. The future will tell us who is right. The Gazelle leaves the day after tomorrow. But the hull is completely rotted. The more one seals it, the worse it gets. That's your problem. To resurface it between now and the day after tomorrow is impossible. lt's completely out of the question. What a scare you gave me! -Where is Olaf? -How would l know? l'm overwhelmed with your party. Dina is taking care of everything. He must be at the port. Dina is here to watch him, isn't she? Dina, where is Olaf? Olaf? l don't know. -What use are you then? -Betty! You always defend her. -Where were you all this time? -At the dressmaker. That's not urgent! Go see what's happened to Olaf instead. You shouldn't treat her like that. She's not a maid. She's still your niece, the daughter of your brother Johann. Hands up! Oh, it's you! Where did you go? l was looking at the Gazelle. Beautiful boat. l went into the hold, the cabins. and even in the masthead. My lord, you're like a real little lndian. You want to go to America like your uncle Johann? Yes, to America, that would be great. Perhaps you'll go there one day. Aunt Dina! Aune says that l'll go to America like Uncle Johann. You know very well that Madam Consul forbids mentioning Mr. Tonnessen to Olaf. Come on, Olaf. Goodbye, Mr. Aune. Tonnessen wasn't a bad guy. He was my brother. A thief who fled to America, how could he not be disowned? All those twenty-year-old stories, can't you forget them? Things like that aren't forgotten. You suffered enough from that disgrace. You should know that. The past is the past. Enough of this useless talk, l'm going to the shipyard. Again? But the workday is over. Over? For the consul, the day is never over. Mr. Krapp, are you leaving already? -No news? -Everything's okay. The invitations were sent. Good, thanks. Miss Dina is still very angry. Really? Where does the Gazelle situation stand? Could you perhaps speak to Miss Dina ? No, no. l haven't raised my daughter, l mean, l haven't raised Dina as my daughter so that later. . . Talk to her. She has to decide her future without me. l believe there are good reasons you should help me. lt would stay in the family. My dear Krapp, l've always been a good boss. You had every reason to be. l know, as an accountant and an employee of 20 years, that there is no document that proves, unfortunately, Mr. Tonnessen's diversion of funds. You want to blackmail me. Be careful, Krapp. The documents could have been misplaced. Very well. Come tomorrow evening, My wife will talk to her about it. ''The battle raged between lndians and trappers, ''but the enemy was too numerous. ''The redskins looked at their tomahawks, hungry for scalps. ''All seemed lost ''when, from a rock overlooking the battle, ''a man addressed the lndians menacingly. ''To be continued.'' Olaf, you aren't asleep yet? All these lndian stories, if your mother knew. You too? lf this continues, l'm going to set sail like Uncle Johann. Hugh, l told you. But you won't leave before tomorrow, right? You'll still sleep here tonight. Hugh, l told you. Flatfooted paleface. -Good evening. -Good evening, Dina. ls Olaf already asleep? Olaf? Yes, of course. Good. A letter has arrived from Argentina. Olaf's collection is complete. -You think he's going to be happy? -Definitely. You're so good to him. -Good night. -Good night, Consul. You know, when Betty. . . When my wife is a bit hard, it's not malice, you know. -Good night, Dina. -Good night. ''The lndians were dancing around the torture post ''while the muffled sounds of buffalo horns ''and otter-skin drums ''resounded.'' The animals have borne the voyage well? We can start tomorrow, when we arrive. Great. Prepare everything for the parade, then. Johann, did you hear? Bessie has borne the crossing well. l knew that you wouldn't let Bessie leave alone. The ranch is in good hands with Hansen. l can leave for a while. Hansen? l have a surprise for you. Come, sit down. Come here. Good lord! Good evening, boss! How was the voyage? -Where did you come from? -From the crew's quarters. We both want to return to our countries, you to Norway, and me to the circus. Old thief, to play such a trick on me! That's okay, Johann. You've had enough ranch work. You can take a few weeks off. We don't really know each other. The brother-in-law of a rich consul and a circus man. A circus man? They're going to be furious! For the entire voyage, l asked myself how to get all those pretentious people angry. Now l know. -ls everything ready? -Yes. OK, let's go. lf your brother-in-law sees you in this outfit, He won't get over it! Well, Director Urbini, go to the front of the procession. l'll remain modestly at the rear. Very well! Keep your chin up, and don't make a fool of me. The circus is here! Come on, let's go see it. What's going on outside? A circus parade. A bunch of good-for-nothings. OK. l'm going to accept the lumber shipment. Consul, don't forget the reception and the little talk we'll have on that occasion? Don't worry, Herr Bridegroom. l'll be back in time. -But that's. . . -lt's definitely him! -Johann Tonnessen. -Running a circus! The Bernicks are going to be delighted. We're all delighted to attend tonight, aren't we? Yes, it was cool last night. A very good idea, this party in Karsten's honor. But this reception has no other meaning? lt's being talked about all over town. Thora, come sit with us. The poor child must be bored. They say that Mr. Krapp has had a new outfit made. Dina! -Go get some tea from the kitchen. -Very well, Madam. She doesn't know anything. -l have to talk to him about it. -Talk to him? She'd be against it, wouldn't she? He's distinguished, and has an income. She'd have to be delighted, with such a mother. Thora, go. . . But what are you doing? He doesn't like cake either. You can go to the kitchen. . . To help Dina, so that l don't hear anything. Always this gossip about me. Dina, nobody's child. Everyone knows that Dina has no father. No need to whisper it. Charming child. l can't stand it. Miss Dina, don't worry! Everyone is good to you. Good. . . The way people are good to a beggar. Miss Dina, they asked me to leave. -Can l help? -No, thank you. Listen! A circus! A circus? What do these parasites want? l don't understand all this secrecy if Dina is getting engaged to Krapp tonight. . . it doesn't matter who her father is! -Don't you think? -No. Betty too has had to accept the idea of having such a brother, after all. Johann Tonnessen. l think it's better for her to have no father at all. Listen, music! What? A circus is here. Yes, of course. Mama, look where l am! Hello, Betty! Johann! Oh, no! Johann Tonnessen! What do you think of that? Thanks, l already have some. With a circus! -Go get. . . -Your medicine? Olaf! Hurry! Olaf with Johann! Hey! Lead Bessie. -You're young Bernick? -Yes, Olaf Bernick. -Do you have brothers and sisters? -No. Would that be a Sioux or a Blackfoot lndian? A Sioux. Right, the Blackfoot has yellow feathers. l'd like to see them, but l have to be my father's successor. And l don't want to. l want to leave here and go to America. l'd think it over carefully, if l were you. lt's easy to leave. But to return home can sometimes be difficult. Olaf, come up here right now! -Mama needs her medicine again. -Olaf! Follow me. Won't you introduce me to this lady? No, l won't survive this. Miss Dorf? The daughter of Ebba Dorf? Yes. l knew your mother. ls she well? She's been dead for some time. -Come on, Olaf! -Can my uncle come? -Yes, if you want. -Gladly. l won't survive this! Mama! lt's Uncle Johann! Betty, still upset over nothing? You're happy, aren't you? Come on, Uncle Johann! Olaf, go to your room right now. My poor nerves. lt's Uncle Johann! Olaf, be sensible. You can come to the circus tonight. Really? You're great, uncle Johann! Goodbye, Miss Dorf. You have things to do in the kitchen. That darling Lona! You remember when we would go dancing? Thora, we're leaving! Miss Thora. Excuse me, but l have a lot to do for the committee. Oh, yes, the committee. What was its name again? For the Support of Social Ethics. That's it, ''The Support of Social Ethics''. Excuse me? So you're in the circus? That was predictable. But that you would have the nerve to come to our house after what has happened is inconceivable to me. -Have you forgotten who Bernick is? -No. Good God. Wait a moment until he returns! l hope l won't have to wait too long. Be good enough to leave my house. Unbelievable! l was hoping for a different reception. Uncle Johann! What do you want? Tell me, where in America do you live? There! How could you let him in? But, Madam, he's your brother, after all! The embezzlement incident - perhaps it's an error. An error? He seems incapable of that. You as well - he's already hoodwinked you. You're your mother's child. Little idiot! How many lndians have you captured? Come to the circus tonight, you'll see them all. -Miss Dina. -Mr. Tonnessen. What's wrong? l'd like to ask you a question. You've been around the world. You were suffocating here too. l'd like to leave. -Leave here? -Yes. -They don't treat you well here? -Yes, but. . . The Consul is very good to me, and Madam is good deep down. But the people of this town. . . We won't leave without having talked to the Consul. -Enough vague promises! -Silence! The Consul left this morning and won't return before evening. When the new shipyard is finished, he'll blow up the reef, at his own expense. Until then, you'll have to manage with the breakers. May he do it quickly! He won't do anything, those were just words. See how they look at us. They are saying: ''Dina Dorf and the runaway, they're like each other.'' They're good at making me feel that l'm not loved. You're imagining things. l want to leave here. You have to help me. Bernick wouldn't forgive me for that. He wouldn't let you leave. The world isn't a simple place. lt took me time to establish myself. lt's here. l live here. -You live here? -Temporarily. Please come in. Pardon me, l'm just checking that everything is in order. Please come in. Have a seat. -Your place is quite pleasant. -Really? lt's my caravan. The director's caravan. You travel the world with them, come rain or shine? How lucky! You would feel a bit cramped, eventually. Don't think that this would be so simple. To be in a different place, town, country, each week. Never a familiar face, never at home. Never a familiar face. lf only l could go somewhere else, where there was no society, as they say. l understand you. My God, l have to leave. We'll expect you tonight. Goodbye, Mr. Tonnessen. Goodbye. See you soon. lf l were you, l'd be ashamed to lead this nice girl on. Director! When Bernick makes promises for the future, it's like trying to catch a fish by the tail. lt slips between your fingers. Here, you protest at the top of your voice, but in his presence, you let yourselves be chased away like whipped curs. You don't even have enough courage, you bunch of water sprites, to speak truth to the Consul. What's the point, boys? Good evening. l spoke truth, l even wrote it. -And here's what the newspaper printed. -What is it? ''Consul Bernick's unselfish project ''runs counter to certain people's interests. ''But this minority ''will surely put the good of the town above its interests''. Us! Us, a minority! How has this town grown? By the work of our hands. What brings boats here? The herring that we catch. lf l understand correctly, they want to take the bread our of your mouths? You could say that. l was a fisherman also. But the railroads came, with steam shovels. They threw all the waste into the sea. ln my native village, we never saw a single fish after that. People like your consul, l'm familiar with them. One must tell them what we think of them. What we think of him! To be honest with him is crazy. But who are you, by the way? Me? l'm the clown in Urbini's Far West Circus. -Knut? -Madam? Don't let anyone in except people with invitations. The musicians are already here? Ah, yes. -My husband is back? -Yes, he's dressing. l'm so impatient. My hook came undone. Hook it up, please. Don't tell the Consul who was here this morning. That would ruin the evening for him. Krapp is coming too. l hope you know how to behave with him. -Mr. Krapp ? -The Consul has high regard for him. ln his home, the Consul likes to eat good fish The Consul loves good fish But when the fishermen are angry That's not his concern Thus are the masters of great houses Good evening. l'm going to see Dina. She's taking a long time getting ready. -That's understandable. -Excuse me. Karsten still doesn't know his good fortune. How so? Tonnessen? Bernick won't let anything show tonight, at a social event. Good health to the honorable Consul! This evening sees us reunited here. . . -Yes, l'm leaving. -You're leaving? l don't want to see Mr. Krapp. Do you think l'm unaware of the reason for his presence here? What does it mean? Oh, l know. l should be honored to marry the deputy. -But what are you saying? -l'm saying what l think. -My child! -Tell him that l can't see him. Hurrah for our Consul! Hurrah! Krapp's speech was superb. Dina can celebrate. lmagine, the daughter of a circus rider. After such a public tribute, you have nothing more to fear. The bank will extend you credit, l'll support you. Much obliged, gentlemen. You know that l'm thinking only of the general good. My boy! Father, may l leave? -To go where? -To the circus! Uncle Johann invited me. He says hello to you. What? Who invited you? You didn't know? Your brother-in-law is here. Johann. He runs the circus. Dina doesn't feel well, but she's thinking of you. Excuse me, Krapp. Come on! Father, what's wrong? Come on, gentlemen, and you, young men, aren't you dancing? -How could you! -Excuse me. Must l welcome with open arms this scoundrel, this betrayer? He's still your brother, and much time has passed. Theft can't be pardoned, even if there's a statute of limitations. Why get worked up about it? No one has ever pressed charges. And there was never concrete proof of that embezzlement. Not to mention Dina. You know she's already gone to meet him. Dina? Do you want to speak to our director? Has he already gone on? He goes last, he's the main attraction. Where is he now? Try down there, behind the second caravan. There he is. With Mr. Tonnessen. -With Mr. Tonnessen? -Yes. Consider yourself lucky if she doesn't come. Otherwise, you'll be unmasked. Don't make a fool of yourself during your act. l'll take care of the rest. Not suited up yet, Herr Director? No. My act comes later. Excuse me. But can l help you with that, Herr Director? Don't call me ''Herr Director'' all the time! Come see our horses instead. Karsten, you can't leave your guests. Red Cloud. Tell me. . . Would you be upset if l weren't the circus director? Herr Director! l'll tell you: l wanted to teach them a lesson. The circus is as honorable a trade as any other. But mine is a little different. ln America, a lot of horses like this one belong to me. But what do you do, then? l run a ranch. Mr. Urbini! Yes? This boy pretends to be your nephew and refuses to pay. Scamp! You come to my circus, and on top of that you lie! -Where are you going? What's wrong? -Where have you been? Well. . . Ah, okay! Forget l said anything, in this case. -Saved! -Olaf! Go see the show. -l'll attend to Bernick. -Thanks, Uncle Johann. You're welcome, my boy. Looking for someone? Where can l find Mr. Tonnessen? -Who are you? -Consul Bernick. His brother-in-law! There to the left, the first caravan. What an honor for my humble dwelling! That's good of you. Betty hasn't been very warm. Sit down. So how are you? You've become a great man in the last 20 years. l. . . There's much l must ask you to forgive me for. To forgive you? Me? Don't keep me in suspense. -Dina was here, just now. -Yes. A nice girl. lt was generous to have taken her in. l behaved badly with her mother. So l try to make up for it with her. Ebba Dorf, the pretty fisherman's wife. You got lucky with her. More than that. . . We loved each other very much. Believe me, it isn't easy for me to come see you. But. . . l want to confess everything. You have to know everything. You have to know that Dina is. . . Her mother died bringing her into the world. l took Dina in. l had just become engaged to Betty. What are you saying? Dina is. . . My child! Think of the community, Johann, think of what the people would have said. Young Bernick and a fisherman's daughter! So l. . . So l allowed people to think. . . that it was you who were her father. Just like Karsten Bernick. Time has passed, you've forgotten the society we inhabit. A society in which l'm at the top. Ladies, stay. My husband will return soon. -ln that case, let's stay. -We can't do that to him. Poor man. Always concerned with the good of the town. Excuse me. l have to be in the office very early tomorrow. -He doesn't seem happy. -Engaged to a circus girl. lf you speak of this, you'll destroy the trust that the entire town has in me. You're my brother-in-law, Karsten. l don't want to do you any wrong. But l value Dina's trust as much as you value the trust of the town. Let them think of me whatever they wish. But Dina must know who her father is. You're going to tell her, Karsten, and today. There he is at last. Where were you? They all wanted to leave. Please excuse me, an urgent call. l hope that you entertained yourselves. Like all the others But his stomach is not like the others to him With the best dishes, he pampers it lf a poor fisherman shares these delights He considers that an injustice Will we allow them to insult the Consul? Don't worry about that, gentlemen. lt's just some drunken sailors amusing themselves. Come, gentlemen. . . But his stomach resembles no other to him The Consul in his house Eats good fish Close the windows! The Gazelle leaves tomorrow. Thus are the masters of great houses Delightful reception this evening. Good night. l've counted all the lndians. So that's okay? Are you satisfied? Very much, Mr. Tonnessen. You captured all the lndians yourself? You see, Aunt Dina! Go on, go home, it's already very late. -Good night, Olaf! -Good night, Uncle. He captured the lndians with a lasso, you think? The horses were wonderful, weren't they? And the seals! The one they all call ''director'' wanted to hit me. if Uncle Johann hadn't come. . . Miss Dorf? Good evening. We were at the circus. At the circus - that's just what l was saying to myself. We have to go home. Good night. A scandal! What a scandal! lt's a conspiracy. Everyone is in league against me. l'm threatened from all sides. But l won't allow it. Not me. l won't allow it! l haven't fought all these years just to. . . And it's not just her who goes to see that scoundrel, she takes the child as well. l didn't take him. He went there himself. -lt's no big deal. -Go to bed! We'll speak of it later. That's shameful, to drag him into the mud that way! -l didn't take him. -Leave me with Dina. She should have stayed with that gypsy. That's where she belongs. Perhaps you're right. That might be better for me. Mr. Tonnessen will watch over me. Yes, the way he has so far! Yes, Mr. Tonnessen will help me. For your information, he's not the circus director. He has a big ranch, where there's work. For me too. -Stay, child. -Let her alone. She obviously knows where her family is. l'm very sorry, Johann, but l'm afraid l won't be able to keep Hansen. What? lf Bernick finds out who wrote that damned song, l can close up shop. He'll ruin my reputation in the entire region. Don't worry. Hansen and l will leave tomorrow. As for Consul Bernick, someone can put in a word for you. What? You want to leave? Alone? You want to leave? -Dina! -Take me! What's wrong? lf you would excuse me, l have to feed the seals. What's wrong? What happened? Even if l were her daughter, l wouldn't put up with that. She said that l should have stayed with you, and he didn't defend me at all. -He said nothing? -Not a word. Besides, she's right. l can't live there. l'm smothering in that house. People may think what they wish, but l won't go back there. l have to tell you something which might change your mind. No. l won't go back. Don't ask me to leave. But Dina, my child, Calm down, look here. lt's impossible. You can't stay here. Yes, l'm staying. No one else understands me. Papa, please, forgive me! All right, but stay in your room until tonight. The Consul has a stomach Like the rest of us Hello, Consul. Let's unveil the sculpture! Aune! Consul? The Gazelle sails today, with its crew. l already told you, that boat can't be resurfaced so quickly. lt can be done, do you understand? The Gazelle goes to sea or you are dismissed. Dismissed? Hello, Consul. Hello, Krapp. Dina didn't want to come last night. l've prepared the estimate for dynamiting the north reef. The fishermen have come back. Dynamiting the reef? The fishermen? That's out of the question. Certainly not now. No one sets terms for me. We'll see who's stronger. Let them row! What's the matter? What do you want? -We want. . . -l don't care! l have no time to lose. l have other things on my mind than your reef. Come back tomorrow, and leave now! Tomorrow. lf he decides not to listen to us, tomorrow will be the same. They're all against me. All. You too, Krapp. Consul, l'll support you as always. lf Miss Dina accepts. . . She was the first to leave me. She's gone, with Tonnessen. -Really? -Yes. To the circus? -Hello, Johann. -Hello. -Did you sleep well? -Very well. Me too. -Better that you hear it. . . -What's the matter? Since Bernick was too cowardly to tell you last night, l have to talk to you, whether he likes it or not. Before people spread lies about me. You think that l'd believe you capable of that? That l'd think you a swindler? What do you mean? You're talking about embezzling money from the shipyard, before you went to America. What? The whole town talks about it. What are we risking? The Gazelle is no longer brand new, but the deck is waterproof, the rudder works. With a good crew, everything will be fine. ln addition, the boat is insured. But really, sir. . . Go see! The Consul will agree to speak with me. Herr Foreman l'd like to speak to the Consul alone. You allowed that. You tolerated people speaking of me in those terms. Or perhaps is it you who passed me off as a thief? You must listen to me. l didn't know what else to do. l was at the edge of bankruptcy. You were helping me in the office for a while. And then you abandoned everything, your sister and your father's shipping company, my business. You went to America. A rumor began that you had embezzled money. l didn't start that rumor. You didn't refute it either. No. Because that rumor saved me. People thought that my business problems were caused by this embezzlement. They were sorry for me, they gave me time to repay my debts. That rumor made me what l am today. First the Dina story, and now this. Lies! You owe your success entirely to lies. And you call yourself a pillar of society? The best there is. You disgust me! lt's time that a sound and honest pillar replaced you. You're finished, my friend. l want my name to be cleared and Dina to know everything. Hello, Miss Dina. -Everything is ready for leaving. -Yes, l think so. Your father isn't here anymore? -My father? -He still hasn't told you anything? Who? Then it's high time that l tell you. Johann Tonnessen is your father. ln this weather, yet! The town must know that the Consul is your father. Yes, Dina. Consul? Very well. . . Do what you wish. Get rid of me. But you know well: if you lose me, you lose my work with me. lf you say the word, l'll withdraw my funds. l've invested my entire fortune in the shipyard, but go ahead, go ahead. . . l'll declare bankruptcy, that's all. My poor. . . poor boy. You've taken enough advantage of others. l've nearly reached my goal. lt's my entire life's work, l've invested my last penny in it. ln two months, the shipyard will be finished. l would have been saved. You could have all said what you wanted then. lf you have to. lt's incomprehensible to me, but after all. Give me two months, at least. Think a little of Olaf. Very well. l give you two months, Karsten. l sail today on the Gazelle. But l'll return in two months, and if you haven't spoken, l'll speak. Come on, Dina. Trust me. America. Let's wait until tomorrow. The storm is too strong. Let's go, we'll leave together. Aunt Dina! Uncle Johann! lt's crazy, in this weather. lt'll sink before it gets to the reef. Who told us that the boat was in good condition? Hey, Johann! l have to talk to you. Hansen? l'm coming! The Bernick shipyard resurfaced it, it's in good condition. The resurfacing was done too quickly. Bernick's brother-in-law reserved two cabins. Bernick wouldn't allow it, if there were a risk. -What's wrong? -l'm not going. l don't want to sink. The boat was resurfaced, but it shouldn't leave in this weather. lf l were you, l'd think twice, with a lady on board. Okay. Consul. There's going to be a storm. Must the Gazelle really go to sea? Why not wait for better weather? He's starting too! This breeze won't capsize us. lf you take that risk, it'll be without us. Come on! Let the Gazelle cast off! STORM Make a U-turn! They're going to succeed. Yes, they're making a U-turn. On the reef, they're finished. Where are you? You're still hiding, you little scamp! Mama! -Look! -Flares. Let's cast off the lifeboats. Take my coat, Mr. Tonnessen. Karsten! He pinned it on his lndian outfit. ''Don't worry about me, ''l'm with Uncle Johann ''on the Gazelle. Olaf.'' Stop! Stop! Don't let the Gazelle leave port! lmpossible to come back now. They're good sailors, have no fear. Mr. Tonnessen and the girl have disembarked. Dina! Where is Olaf? Stay here, Madam. You can't do anything. -But Olaf! -Johann is with the fishermen. Look! There's Bernick! -Let's get him! -Let him swallow some water! Let him drown and give us back the port! Let's get him! Don't stand there, help me. Consul. . . This way, Mr. Tonnessen! Uncle Johann! Be calm, my boy. He's alive. Why do you always run away, my boy? Why run away? He must go back now. He must go back right away. Dina will make him some tea. lt's so cold, take him to the house. Go back to the house. Come with me, papa. Uncle Johann will stay with you now. Always. l know l haven't always treated you well. But. . . from now on. . . everything. . . everything will change. Change completely. l have one more thing to say to you. Johann Tonnessen will succeed me. He will repair the wrongs that l have committed against you. The city and the port have hoisted their flags. Along with the workers of your shipyard, the citizens and thefishermen are here to convey their best wishes for your first boat, Mr. Tonnessen. Hurrah for Uncle Johann! l baptize you ''Bright Future.''
