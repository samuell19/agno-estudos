It's time for the peninsula report. After three weeks, the murder of a local Burlingame girl remains unsolved, and police have no leads in the killing of Kathleen Donlevy, the eighth grader last seen alive at a parking lot carnival. Coroners say the victim was tortured... FORCED TO DRINK BLEACH, WINDOW CLEANER. ...the investigation at a standstill-- MARY! MARY, BREAKFAST IS READY! COME ON! MARY, CAN YOU SEE MY BUTT? - I CAN SMELL IT. - SHUT UP. CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU? BUSTED. - WHAT ARE THESE? - I DON'T KNOW. DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THIS HOUSE? I DON'T KNOW. WHERE'D YOU FIND THEM? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE I FOUND THEM, DOES IT? THE POINT IS I FOUND THEM. ARE THEY YOURS? - THEY'RE NOT-- - TELL ME. ARE THEY YOURS? - NO, THEY'RE NOT MINE. - MOM, MOM, MOM. THEY'RE MINE. I MEAN-- I MEAN, THEY'RE LIZ'S. I WAS HOLDING THEM SO SHE WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE. IT'S OKAY. WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS LATER-- SHUT UP, LITTLE MISS PERFECT. WHAT'S UP? THE QUESTION IS WHY? WHY DID HE KILL HER? DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME HONKING FOR YOU LAST NIGHT? I MET SOME GUYS AT THE PARK. YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHE REPRESENTED SOME KIND OF THREATENING FEMALE FIGURE, YOU KNOW, LIKE MOM-- ONE OF THEM ASKED ME TO THE EXCHANGE DANCE NEXT FRIDAY. I BET IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SICK GUYS WHO TOTALLY GOT MOLESTED BY HIS FATHER. - MARY. - IT'S SO CLASSIC. - IT ALWAYS HAPPENS. - WOULD YOU SHUT UP? STOP TALKING ABOUT KATHLEEN LIKE SHE'S SOME KIND OF STATISTIC. - I WASN'T. - YES, YOU WERE. THIS ISN'T IN A MAGAZINE. IT'S REAL. MARGIE'S LITTLE SISTER IS DEAD. THE GUY COULD STILL BE AROUND. IT'S CREEPY. LET ME SET YOU UP NEXT FRIDAY FOR THE DANCE. DO YOU THINK I'M, LIKE, THE BUTT-UGLIEST? NO, OF COURSE NOT. THEN WHY HAVE I NEVER HAD A DATE? BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU MEET A GUY, YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEAD WOUNDS. THE VIRGIN MARY IS NOT ONLY PURE, BUT IMMACULATE. NOT ONLY VIRTUOUS, BUT INNOCENCE ITSELF. SHE IS SACRED, COMPLETELY UNTAINTED BY SIN. MARY GIORDANO. YES, SISTER? PLEASE RECITE THE HIERARCHY OF VALUES. UM... IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK, MARGIE. YOUR SISTER HAS BEEN IN OUR PRAYERS. THANK YOU. WE WERE ABOUT TO HEAR THE HIERARCHY OF VALUES. SUPERNATURAL, SPIRITUAL, INTELLECTUAL, MATERIAL. TELL US IN YOUR OWN WORDS THE HIERARCHY'S SIGNIFICANCE. WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A STRUCTURE, A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOD GAVE US THIS PLAN, AND IF WE HAVE FAITH IN IT AND FOLLOW ITS RULES, HE'LL PROTECT US. IN GOD'S WORLD, THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING. YES, MARGIE? MARGIE? HEY. - HEY, NEW CADETS? - WELL, I HOPE SO. WE'RE ABOUT TO GIVE THEM GUNS. YOU WANT ONE? NAH. I GOT TO GET IN SHAPE FOR MY EXAM. - AH. - IS G-MAN HERE? - YEAH, HE'S IN HIS CELL. - GREAT. BUT, MARY, I WOULDN'T GO BACK THERE IF I WERE YOU! MARY! YEAH? SHIT. DON'T YOU HAVE PIANO LESSONS OR SOMETHING? TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE DONLEVY CASE. DIDN'T I HELP YOU WRITE THE PAPER ON JEFFREY DAHMER? - YEAH. - DIDN'T I HELP YOU BUILD A MODEL OF SAN QUENTIN FOR YOUR CALIFORNIA HISTORY CLASS? YEAH. THEN GET THE HELL OUT. DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO HELP ME. YOUR DAD WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. HE'D WANT YOU TO HAVE A NICE, SAFE DESK JOB. YOU KNOW I'D BE A GOOD COP. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT POLICE WORK IS? MOST OF THE TIME YOU SIT ON YOUR ASS WRITING REPORTS. THE REST OF THE TIME, YOU SPEND WITH THE SCUM OF THE EARTH. PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD. THEY JUST-- THEY'RE GOOD AND BAD. YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, OR YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE. BELIEVE ME. I KNOW MY BUSINESS. REALLY? IS THAT WHY KATHLEEN'S KILLER IS BEHIND BARS? NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT. THIS FREAK MADE HER DRINK BLEACH, WINDOW CLEANER, AND CHOPPED HER UP. HE'S STILL OUT THERE. SO THE LAST THING I NEED IS FOR SOME SNOT-NOSED JUNIOR MISS COMING IN HERE GIVING ME ADVICE! BUT DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT A DETECTIVE'S JOB IS TO STEP INTO THE VICTIM'S SHOES AND WALK BACKWARDS? THAT'S RIGHT. SO UNLESS YOU'VE STEPPED IN MISS DONLEVY'S SHOES YOURSELF... SO I'M LIKE, "HOW DO YOU KNOW?" GO! GO! ARE YOU SERIOUS? HE TOOK OFF MY TOP, THEN MY UNDERWEAR. NO WAY. THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS PANTS. WHAT DID YOU DO? 13 MORE. SO WHO'S YOUR BOYFRIENDS? DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE BOYFRIENDS? SHE SORT OF DOES. YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND? - YEAH. - A LITTLE YOUNG. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER. YOU GIRLS REALLY SHOULDN'T TALK TO STRANGERS. HE'S SO CUTE. DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY? SURE. HE'S BEEN HANGING AROUND HERE A LOT. HEY! 50 CENTS TO CRACK THE WHIP! ONLY THREE BALLS, A CHANCE TO WIN THE BIG PRIZE. Have a nice weekend. Remember, graduation rehearsal will be at 2:00 p.m. next Friday. GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? Let me ask you this, Jay. Do you ever feel any remorse after you kill? Remorse? Why should I feel remorse? Okay. Why don't we go to the phones? Line three, you're on the air. I NEED YOU TO GO TO THE MINI MART FOR ME. WELL, CAN'T JOHN GO? HE'S AT JASON'S, AND VICKY'S AT THE MALL. I JUST NEED A FEW THINGS. IT WILL ONLY TAKE YOU A MINUTE. DAMN IT. SIR, I'M SORRY. WE ARE OUT. - SORRY. - EXCUSE ME. OH, MY EYES! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT HERE? I CAN'T SEE! HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WAS A COP? TONY CAMPBELL, A NEW CADET. HIGHEST TEST SCORES IN HIS CLASS. I'M BLIND. WHY WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME? I SAW YOU HERE AT THE STATION. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF DONLEVY'S GIRLFRIENDS. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LEAD ME TO SOMETHING. I OUGHT TO KICK BOTH OF YOU IN THE ASS. YOU KNOW IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS FOR A CADET TO BE INVESTIGATING ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FILES OR ANY KIND OF INFORMATION. AND, YOU, I'M CITING YOU FOR USING UNREGISTERED MACE. AND THE NEXT TIME THAT YOU WANT TO DREAM UP SOME ESPIONAGE, I'M CALLING YOUR MOTHER. YOU MESSED HIM UP, YOU TAKE HIM HOME. WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT KATHLEEN, ANYWAY? NO WAY I'M WAITING 10 YEARS TO MAKE DETECTIVE. YOU KNOW, THIS CASE IS VERY SIMILAR TO ONE THAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO IN... UTAH? I KNOW. TAMMY RYDER. TEENAGE GIRL DISAPPEARS INTO THIN AIR, BODY PARTS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE. POLICE FOUND NOTHING. SEARCHED THE CAR, CLOTHES, HOUSE. NOT EVEN A FLAKE OF SKIN TO TRACK THE GUY THROUGH DNA. HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT? ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO FIND KATHLEEN'S KILLER? I MEAN, 'CAUSE IF YOU ARE, AS A CADET, YOU DO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE COMPUTERS. I MEAN, WE COULD TRACK DOWN ANY SUSPECT WE GOT THROUGH WASHINGTON. WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON, WE COULD COVER TWICE AS MUCH GROUND, - INTERVIEW TWICE-- - WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE YOU AFTER THIS GUY? SHE COULD HAVE BEEN ME. I'M NOT INTO BABYSITTING. NO! NO, THAT'S A FOUL! THAT IS A STUPID FOUL! YOU IDIOT! YOU ARE SO STUPID! IS GUINN IN? THEY TELL ME TO BET AGAINST THE CLIPPERS 'CAUSE THEY CAN'T WIN A GAME, AND NOW I'VE LOST 50 BUCKS. GOSH. IS GUINN IN? YOU KNOW IT'S HIS DAY OFF. - OH, YEAH. - OH, THAT'S GREAT. BUT I LEFT SOMETHING IN HIS OFFICE THE OTHER DAY, - AND I WANT TO GO GET IT. - GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. COME ON! KATHLEEN. ...0800, please report to the kit room at the end of the shift. - Repeat, three... - He said that? NO WAY. - AMAZING. - YEAH, I KNOW. HEY, SHERLOCK. COME ON, MAN. HEY, TONY. HURRY UP! OKAY, I'M SORRY ABOUT THE BABYSITTING COMMENT. IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH, WE COULD WORK TOGETHER. PLEASE? COME ON. LOOKS LIKE AN EMPLOYEE LIST OF THE CARNIVAL. BIG DEAL. SHE WAS SEEN SOMEWHERE LATER. WHAT? AT THE MINI MART. - LET ME HANDLE THIS. - WHY? BECAUSE YOU GOT TO BREAK INTO THE RECORDS ROOM. NOW IT'S MY TURN. WE'RE WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. I ALREADY TOLD YOU GUYS EVERYTHING. WELL, WE'D LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN. WERE YOU WORKING THE NIGHT THE DONLEVY GIRL CAME IN? - YEAH. - CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT AND YOUR CONTACT WITH MISS DONLEVY? YOU GUYS AIN'T COPS. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. OW! SHIT! OKAY! SHE CAME IN ABOUT 12:30 AND PICKED UP SOME CLEANSER OR SOMETHING. SHE STOOD AROUND LIKE SHE EXPECTED ME TO SAY SOMETHING, AND THEN SHE LEFT. WAS ANYONE WITH HER? NO! OW! OW! OW. DON'T-- WAIT. THERE WAS A BLUE CAR IN THE PARKING LOT. I LOOKED UP LATER, AND IT WAS GONE. THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST DID THAT. HE WASN'T GOING TO TELL US ANYTHING. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HURT HIM. IT JOGGED HIS MEMORY, DIDN'T IT? IT WAS ILLEGAL. HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK BEING A COP IS, MARY? YOU WALK IN, OFFER YOU A DONUT, AND SPILL THEIR GUTS? THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. PEOPLE GET HURT, BLEED, DIE. HE COULD GO TO THE POLICE. HE WON'T. HE'S GOT FOUR B&Es AND A FEAR OF GOING BACK TO COUNTY. LOOK, IF WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER, YOU GOT TO TRUST ME. WHY SHOULD I? BECAUSE YOU LIVED YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN A SUBURBAN BUBBLE. I'VE SEEN THE WORLD FOR THE SHITHOLE IT REALLY IS. YOU THINK I'M NAIVE. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU. YOU REALLY THINK THE WORLD'S THAT BAD? MY DAD GAVE ME A BAD ATTITUDE. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, HE WANTED ME TO BE A DIVER. ONLY ONE THING HE NEVER TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION, I'M AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. I REMEMBER ONE TIME THEY MADE ME GO OFF THE HIGH DIVE. EVERYONE WAS SCREAMING FOR ME TO GO, AND I JUST STOOD THERE PETRIFIED. TOUGH COP, HUH? I GOT TO GO. I GOT TO STUDY. Only two short blocks from Central Avenue. This fun-filled extravaganza of rides and games will send you and your family into a spin. Carnival Magic is in your neighborhood. It's the final week of a month of fun, so be sure and catch Carnival Magic. It's brought thrills to boys and girls up and down the west coast. "UP AND DOWN THE WEST COAST." HMM. HEY, YOU WANT THE TILT-A WHEEL TONIGHT? - HI. - ON IT! DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE MAIN OFFICE IS? RIGHT OVER THERE. - THANKS. - MM-HMM. HI. I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR MY HIGH SCHOOL PAPER ON MODERN-DAY TRAVELING CARNIVALS, AND I WAS WONDERING... COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT CITIES YOU'VE BEEN TO IN THE PAST YEAR? YES. NO. I'LL DO YOUR DISHES FOR A MONTH. YEAH, LAST TIME, I THINK I GOT ABOUT 50 HOURS COMMUNITY SERVICE. UH-UH. JOHN! ALL RIGHT. 100 BUCKS. I CAN'T GET 100 BUCKS. IT'S EASY. YOU JUST TAKE IT FROM MOM'S STASH, REPLACE IT WITH MONEY FROM YOUR SAVINGS. I'M NOT GOING TO STEAL FROM MOM. OKAY. YEAH? OKAY. YOU KNOW, IF MOM SNAKES YOU DOING THIS, YOU'RE DEAD MEAT. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. GO. DO IT. THESE CARNIVAL EMPLOYEES, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT KINDS OF CARS THEY DRIVE. NO BLUE CARS. CARS SEEN NEAR UNSOLVED MURDER SITES. OKAY.

I'LL JUST WAIT OUT HERE. WHATEVER. THE RING TOSS. COME WIN, AND PLAY THE RING TOSS. - LET'S GO, DAD. - YEAH. JESUS. HIS HAND IS MESSED UP. LOOKS LIKE IT'S DEFORMED. THE ONLY WILD CARD IS THAT BLUE MALIBU - SUSPECTED IN WASHINGTON. - HMM. - WONDER WHY THE COPS DIDN'T CATCH THE PATTERN? - THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR IT. AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED, THESE ARE SEPARATE MURDERS. THE M.O.s ARE DIFFERENT. THEY HAPPENED IN DIFFERENT CITIES. WE'VE GOT A WINNER ON HORSE NUMBER THREE. HORSE NUMBER THREE. WHAT ABOUT THE CARNIVAL, THOUGH? IT'S AN OBVIOUS LINK. MAYBE NOT ALL THE VICTIMS WENT TO THE CARNIVAL. I MEAN, WHY WOULD THE COPS KNOW ABOUT IT IF THERE WAS NOTHING TO LEAD THEM THERE? THE ONLY REASON I THOUGHT OF IT WAS 'CAUSE I HEARD THE RADIO COMMERCIAL AND REMEMBERED SOME OF THE WEST COAST MURDERS IN "TRUE CRIMES'" UNSOLVED FILE. THE VICTIMS WERE ALL TEENAGE GIRLS. IF HE DID IT, I WONDER WHY. MAYBE 'CAUSE HE'S A FREAKING MANIAC. MURDER IS A DESPERATE CRY FOR HELP, SOMEONE REACHING OUT. IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHY SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING, YOU CAN HELP THEM. - REALLY? - YEAH. BANG. A WOMAN'S WALKING DOWN A STREET. A BULLET HITS HER HEAD. BANG. A PLANE CRASHES INTO A MOUNTAIN, 300 PEOPLE DEAD. BANG. BABY GETS LEUKEMIA, DIES AT AGE THREE. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? THE WORLD IS CHAOTIC. SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO REASONS. YOU'RE WRONG. YOU SERIOUSLY THINK HE WANTS TO GET CAUGHT? COME ON. NO WAY AM I GOING UP ON THAT THING. OH, YEAH. AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. WELL, KEEP AN EYE ON ME. I GOT TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT, OKAY? HEY. HEY. MARY.

THANKS. CHEERS. CHEERS. BIG DRINKER, HUH? BLUE MALIBU. THE BLUE MALIBU. WHERE THE HELL IS THE BLUE MALIBU? WELL, LET'S TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE KID AT THE MINI MART COULD BE FULL OF SHIT. TRUE.
