MY SUMMER IN PROVENCE It's not fair on us. Nobody asked us. We're not 5 now. We could've stayed in Paris. Sure. You're both under 18. Leave you alone in Paris for 2 months? We're not kids, Granny. Your Mum agreed with me. It was a bolt from the blue. Just before the holidays, everybody's made plans, your mother's in Montreal... That could wait! Honey, these days, if you get an offer in July, you don't wait till September. This was the best solution. That was for Dad not to bail on us. In a few minutes, our next stop, Avignon. Come on... Grab your things. Adrien, what did we say? It's my jungle survival kit. 2 km to the nearest village. And 10 to the movies. You serious? I googled it. Gramps will be waiting at the station. Gramps? We've never even met him. That's a point, how did he react? Hurry! It only stops 2 minutes. You didn't answer. Shit, my Nikes! Granny! You told him we were coming? You didn't tell him? Shit, the guy's a hulk. Did you picture him like that? On photos, he seemed less... Y'know... - Nice to meet you too! - Give him time. 17 years isn't enough time? This thing got aircon? Open the window. Good morning, sir. Any vacancies? What? Bed and breakfast, yes? Can't you read? Damn thing's in English! It's boiling. There's a pool, at least? Sure, there's even a Jacuzzi. - There's no signal! - No idea. You must have a mobile. I hate being rung for. What are you waiting for, a porter? How could you do this to me? Without telling me? This way, they get a real holiday. They're staying till September? Paul, your fight with their mother is not their fault. 17 years, not one phone call, and when it suits her, she ships me her kids. "Suits her"? A divorce? I said it wouldn't last. 17 years! Don't be so mean. It happens. Divorce? Too right. It's the national sport. You and me, we're the Last of the Mohicans. What's wrong, Théo? That's the dog, Goa. Get the mattresses out of the shed. Go on! It's only Goa. You've seen him already, on the photos. What the hell's that? A drone? You don't get wasps in Paris? In the attic. It's too heavy for you. No idea where he's going. Where's Gramps? Didn't feel like helping, I guess. Fuck it! Two months in this dump. That's so full of fail! Get any texts on the train? Who from? Dad? Who knows, maybe he cares how we did in our exams and stuff. Dream on. He won't call, he's too ashamed. Ashamed? Him? Now, you're dreaming. Shit, there's still no signal. Even up here? Shit! Buried alive! Adrien! I've got reception in here. Me too! We're good! A total shrine to the 90s! I made room for you. Mom left all her stuff behind? You mean, she ran away? Aged 17, and pregnant with Adrien, too. After leaving school with straight A's. She planned to study Agronomy at Montpellier. I can't begin to tell you, Gramps was so mad. Hold on... Isn't that Amy Winehouse with you? She's my idol. Dad got me tickets. I waited outside for her. Like sisters, aren't we? That's Mum! She looks so cute! What was the big issue with Dad? What didn't Gramps like? Everything. And your grandfather messed up. He asked your mother to choose. She chose your father. But you chose us! MY darling Granny! All those trains I caught. They know me on that line. I'm glad you're all here. Dammit! Léa, dinner! What about your shoes? Let them dry outside. We'll try tomorrow with Mr. Clean. It's ready! When Granny says it's ready, it's ready! Can you get some plates out? What an antique! - Does it work? - Who knows! Here, the TV watches us. What did he say? The spiders here are huge. Tell him he's fine, they're scared of me. Didn't you hear me? Didn't you hear me? - In Paris, we eat late. - You're in our home, not Paris! Beef with aubergines! What don't you want? The bone? That's lucky. He's gone off beef? No, it's not that. Théo has realized that meat is sacrificed animals. We explained it. Only the really nasty animals get killed. The ones that deserve it. Hold on, that fella there was ferocious. With huge horns. Enormous! Used to attack calves. Tiny, little calves. Eliminated! C'mon, give me your plate. Look at that, there you go. Your plate. No way. I'm locavore veggie. What did she say? The veggie carpaccio type. Locally grown veg, obviously. You've heard of industrial farming? Sure. Cows fart and wreck the ozone layer. Shit! What now? The garlic! Sure, in Provence, we use garlic. In Bayonne, you'd get chilli. In India, curry. You got any bananas? A few peaches. Where's the tea? The shelf by the sink. A black sachet. Seriously, you don't buy fair trade? Fair is when it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I see. I'm gonna go poke a friend. You got enough speed? Who knows? I gotta blow. Did you hear that? You say nothing? Bedtime? I'll read you a nice story. I know, usually it's Daddy. His father's done reading him stories. No one offered to help. You saw that? Tell me, is this what you call making an effort? You found them polite? They needed a granddad, we got that. What do they look like? Léa, with that turban, the Bin Laden look? And Adrien, doing everything in slow-motion? Have you forgotten? - What? - Your youth! We had flowers in our hair, not nails in our eyebrows! They're called piercings. She looks stapled together. Don't let her near a metal detector, she'll wind up pinned down by the cops. I won't spend summer listening to you whine. Take an interest in them. Communicate! I don't know... I don't know either. You left him on his own? With a PSP, you're never truly alone. Shit, two months here with that hick! Know what pisses me off? Théo becoming a nomad. One week at Dad's, next week at Mum's. Unless Mum lands the job in Montreal and we move with her. You'd leave Paris? Your friends? Start talking like Céline Dion? What about us later? What about us? Marriage and all that? Count me out of that! Starting over every few years? Marriage is for retards! They married and lived miserably every after! 40 years, how'd they do it? I mean, how did Granny do it? He's a total wacko. Leave it, we'll do it tomorrow. No, I'll go now. It's sweltering in here, too. Where's he going? Taking the rubbish out, I think. You mean they don't compost here? You're kidding me! Not a single light anywhere. Nothing. You love nature. I defend nature, I never said I'd live in it. I pictured you raising goats in Patagonia. At least I'm eco-aware. Don't waste water. 18 liters a minute. Turn that back on! Pain in the ass, Greenpeace! Holy fucking shit! Stupid goddamn cable! It's okay, no damage. Me neither, thanks. We lucked out, I guess. Your chair, perhaps? Not perhaps. All this surfing, you'll end up catching a germ. The word is virus, actually. Can't you stop even on a day like this? I'm making new friends on Facebook. Sign you up? Forget it. Look up your old pals? Don't bother. Hot, isn't it? It's a beautiful day. Yes, but very hot. A very beautiful day. - Where's Léa? - Sleeping. Goa, c'mon. Let's go. C'mon, boy! Go get! What's the dog doing here? Get off me! Let me sleep! What? Sleep well? Mind if I don't smoke? Truce! I'm outside, right? Last year, swathes of forest went up in smoke thanks to a teen nutjob. I'm no nutjob. No smoking in summer. Not in my house. - We get the picture. - What? We're in your house. What are you insinuating? We know we're not welcome. I'm not insinuating, I'm saying! Nobody asked me, certainly not your mother. She didn't ask us either! Cut that out! You think we asked to come here, into the wild? - Your mother calls it that? - Paul! What did she say about me? You must've heard some real tripe. You want the truth? Do you? She said nothing. We never talk about you. Never! Adrien, stop it! 24 hours and you show me no respect. Respect is earned. Enough talk. Iréne, they're going home. For once, we agree. It's pointless. We'll never get along. Great! Let's get outta here! Adrien... Léa... Paul! 48 hours, and it's full-on hysteria! - Chill out. - I can't chill out! My life's crumbling around me! You're all staying and you'll apologize, got it? Over my dead body! You'll apologize, I said! To Granny. It's not her fault. How can we stick it out? He never wanted us... It wasn't him. I broke off contact. Not him Look! - You like it? - For you. Me? It's not my style. It's beautiful. Léa, I look like a street light. No, you don't. It looks classy. Trust me. I'd pitch my tent there. Pitch your what? Peaches! I'm not your fridge! Put it back or pay for it. You moron! Thanks. Watch those puppies float. Float? No, he means "throat". I love Sweden. Wait for me at the café, in the shade. I'll get a cap for Théo. Slurping on it, you bad girl! Those girls, I got their numbers. Casanova, be gone! I said I was a model in Paris. They bought it? Inbred provincials, shit, they're loud! But not mean. The chips are on the house. Good of you. You're from up north? No. Paris. For us, Paris is up north. It's in the Arctic Circle! Iréne? So these three are... Emilie's kids? That's right! Paul! Why didn't you say? You've made up with Emilie? That's good to hear. - What are their names? - That's Léa. He's my little Théo. I'm Adrien. Paris accent so sharp, it poked my eye out! The Vikings are back. And happy, too! Just imagine, Gothenburg in November... Reykjavik in January... Some people are cursed. Here's to us! Don't buy a thing from that crook! It's made in Shanghai. Everybody knows. What a complete con! We always say, "When you have no right..." "Take the left!" Hi there. Can I get a Regina? Hold the ham. - And a Margerita. - Sure. Here come the Smurfs. Look, they're blue! Show some respect. You're not local. I know, the accent... No, the pale-face look, see? - And this is the Pampa! - Precisely. How about an Abrivado? Are you free Saturday? What's an Abri-whatever? An Abrivado. It's a bull run in the streets. Like in Pampluna? Except we corral them. - Who are "we"? - The Gardians. On horseback. You'll come? Why not? I'm hardly overbooked right now. - I'm Tiago. - Léa. Who's that? Pizzaman? A kid from Marseille. Since he arrived, every Friday's a feast. Marseille isn't in Provence. Don't be daft! It's a 45-minute drive! Different mentality. Two mineral waters on me. Look! Absolute beauty! O, Magali, I love you so Won't you come to your window? - Tiag, is it ready? - Coming right up. Cool! The new Nikes! Shame about the stains. Here, beautiful. Homemade ice cream, opposite the pharmacy. Drop by. See you, Tiag. Where's the nearest Nike store? Why? Did Mum give you any cash? Not to buy you identical pairs of sneakers. Can we go to this Gardians thing? I'll ask your Mum. Say no more. I'll walk there anyway. You're your mother's daughter. Mamma mia! So pig-headed! Shit! What? My pink thong, the one with the bow. It's gone! With the Mistral blowing, if you didn't peg it... - Where's it gone? - Who knows? Mira mas? Martigues? Sardinia? Mum never went backpacking. - Who's the globetrotter then? - Us. Who's "us"? Gramps and me. Those are our trips. Hold on... Athens, Istanbul, Teheran, Peshawar, Bombay, Goa! How'd you do all that? Hitching? No, a Triumph. The motorbike. Hold on... Look! Who's that? Gramps as John Lennon! Granny's not bad either. Looks like Janis Joplin. Check this out, Granny hitchhiking. I couldn't do it, freaks me out. Amazing places, they saw. Granny, the Shaolin monk! - They went all over. - All by bike. - Awesome. - Insane! Inconceivable now. I recognize that. Isn't it Montmartre? Are you serious? It's the Taj Mahal. In India. Cool it. I knew! So Gramps was cool back in the day? He was... Help yourselves and put the photos away. You're ashamed? You were drop-dead gorgeous. You loved travelling? Me? I adored it. - Why'd you guys stop? - Gramps. - He turned the page. - Just like that? Sunstroke. Turned him fascist. Eat up and don't be silly. What about Gramps? He's out watering. Isn't it an automatic system? There are special times. You have to open the sluice gates. It's complicated. He was dead drunk. Totally wasted. He couldn't stand up. I can't say I'm surprised. Their olive oil? You're gonna fry! No, it's organic. The sun locks in the calcium. - It's a fact. - As if. Here... - Gramps is on Facebook? - I signed him up. Does he know? 6 messages. What do we do? You're kidding me! Jean-Michel Bourguignon, property lawyer in Clermont. And him? Franck Perrot, chestnut spread maker in Ardeche. His buddies are so "wild!" What are you doing? Come on. Come over here. Take a look at this. Look. You see the hens? The white hens? Know what my hens make? Now to hatch it... Come on. We'll give it to her to sit on. She'll hatch it. Here... Look. Let's leave him in peace. Come on. You're here. Squat down. Tell me when it reaches your end. Your end. You tell me. It's at the end? Now, go over there and move the hose one row down. Go on. That's good. Very, very good. You picked some apricots? Taste good, huh? Stop.- Not after apricots. Don't drink. Don't. Makes your belly ache. You'll be sick. What's up? It's the bull run. We're leaving. Coming, Théo? When we're done, I'll take you to see the bulls, okay? You can go. What the hell is this? This is an Abrivado? Isn't that Pizzaman over there? Alright. They're all nuts here. Come on. - Cool, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was fun. Those guys are total wackos. I'd never do that. Look who it is. Well? Like it? Totally. Matthieu, line up 3 Pastis. Bit of a tan suits you. - How's it going? - Good. You? Funny hair. How's it stick together? Cactus sap. Straight from Mexico. - What are you doing? - What's the big deal? It's just a can. 670 cans make a bike, you know. We're not into bikes. We prefer horses. Not for you. In Africa! - Africa's miles away. - On a bike made out of cans. Two minutes before the apocalypse, and you joke about it. Jokes are a serious business here. Get it? Work less, laugh more. You need a fix of fun. You look underage. Right? When you have no right, take the left. Blondie's catching on fast. Shit, wrong way round. That's so yesterday! My folks danced to it. We love it. They're local. What do you listen to? Amy Winehouse. You and your eco-Taliban buddies, can't you just get a life? Take it easy, be nice. C'mon, let's dance. No other city beats Paris. Just don't live there. Or drive there. We went once. I mean, we're nearly did. I remember that ring road, one big car park! Bumper to bumper. Maybe 20 k from the Eiffel Tower? Know what? We turned back. We floored it home. And when we saw cypress trees, we howled, man! Paris is alive 24/7. When's the last time you went to a game? Seriously? - See! - We go to watch Marseille for real. We love you, Marseille, we do! Sorry. She's not bad for 100! Can I get some privacy? Go back to Butch Cassidy! Visit the bullring? You're a strange girl, but a great kisser. How'd you... When they've finished poisoning the aquifers with nitrates and their daughters give birth to 2-headed monsters, they'll switch to organic, like it or not. What? No, that's just a game. It's called: Catch my Gum. For your information, I never fall in love. For your information, I do. C'mon, drinks on me! I'm a happy man! Game over. - Home time. - I can explain... Save your breath. You told them you're underage? Because I'm a girl, right? If it was Adrien... Good point. Where the hell is he? I detest him! I hate him! He's trying to protect you. You just met the boy. I'm happy for once, and he ruins it! Don't be so melodramatic. What did I do to him? He's scared. Is that so hard to understand? It's Tiago. He wants to take me to Camargue. Forget it, Gramps will never let me go. - That's the real issue? - What is the issue? The real issue is, "Is he the one?" Your first time... Am I wrong? Should be unforgettable. It matters. Leave it all to me. Don't sulk at Gramps now. Don't provoke him. And stay off the booze. Promise? - Come on. - Wait. Take a seat. Look... Over there is Eygaliéres Hill. Me and my buddies gallop around it like that, and arrive there. - Where? - Right there. Stop it, you gave me a fright! What's that there? - Where? - There. Not Provence. Forget it. It's mega-pretty here. "Mega-pretty"? Paris-speak. You wouldn't understand. Want some? Just go for it. "Love... "is a dream." You can't even read, dummy. Stuffy today, huh? Feels like a storm brewing. Maybe, yeah, it's very, very hot. Is that enough? A bit more? That okay? Or I can break out a fresh tub. That's fine. There you go. Thanks, Mrs... I'll put it on Iréne's tab. Okay. You bought a ton, Adrien! With the prices Magali charges... Who's that again? Demi Moore! Who? Stop that! Shit, Léa, it's Easy Rider! Actually, I think you'll find it's Old Geezer Rider. My God, I don't believe it! Franck! Jean-Mi! Laurette! Elie! So you went back to the land! The back of beyond! Even the GPS went round in circles. He kept bawling me out. Paul! It's so good to see you. How did you find us? Facebook. We thought, let's surprise 'em. Busted. He's rumbled you. He'll slaughter you! Come and meet my grandchildren. I missed you. Laurette's a Pastis. I'll get it. I'll take him. So you never stopped hitting the road? Never! A different trip every year. Last year, the fjords, Norway... Froze our nuts off. So this year, Provence. Thanks to you. - Here, Paul. - Thanks. My bike saved my life. I mean, I took over Dad's law firm in the sticks. What about you? All good. I'm a Tantric sexologist. Nothing heavy, just practical stuff! - Franck? - I moved to Ardéche with my wife. We're having a kid. Here's to you! That's why I can't stay over tonight. And you, Elie? Married? To her. Cheers! - Under control? - I think so. Granny! Stunning! Where'd the crickets go? They stopped? Same time, every evening. And now it's time for the chiggers. The what? They're like tiny, tiny mosquitoes. Rapaciousl Little bastards! When do they stop? He's still got it. I'm at low tide here. Have a drop of farigoule. It's thyme liqueur. Anything from herbs is fine by me. - It's natural. - Can't do any harm, right? Shit, it burns! It disinfects. How did you guys all meet? Jean-Mi and Laurette at Woodstock. Woodstock? Sure! They introduced us to Elie. Four days and four nights of rock. Jimi Hendrix imitating bombs falling on Vietnam with his guitar... Santana and that drum solo... - 10 minutes! - I remember. - Joe Cocker... - Janis Joplin! Never got over it. And then we met Franck at the festival in Avignon. We were hanging out in the square, with folks lobbing us peanuts almost. We looked like total dropouts, remember! - You good? - I'm good. Great place you have. Yeah, it's really cool here. You're too fast for me. But what did you all live on? One year, in Peshawar, we bought a job lot of goatskin Afghan coats. We loaded up the van, remember? They stank so bad we drove 4,000 km with all the windows open. We got a good price for the damn things. They paid for our motorbikes. Away we went, to party in India. Your grandmother was a goddess of love. Hold on, you mean... Granny and you, you... Slow down now. Not just me. You mean... Free love, kid. We were dreamers. Stoners, you mean. But you, kids, don't mess with it. It's dangerous. You guys are still here. Actually, not all of us. Not Manu. He returned to the cosmos. You idiot! Paul, I had no idea. After all this time... Hold on, who was Manu? Your great-uncle. Your grandfather's brother. You didn't know? We only just met. A long story. Sorry. I'm really sorry. - Can I change somewhere? - Of course. It's embarrassing, but I have no spare rooms. 30 years renovating. All our money goes on the olive groves. Léa will take you to Magali's. She does B&B. I called. She's expecting you. Magali's? I know the way, I can take them. Okay, thanks. Let's get changed. No shit! Hands off the bike. That one has a problem. The starter's playing up. There's a mechanic here. You want me to call him? He'll take a look at it. Can I sleep over? Say yes. Okay, but close the shutters upstairs. Maybe they're just friends. In that case, they're very close friends. What a bastard! What the hell does he see in her? Damn Queen of Sheba! Queen of his boner, you mean! She should be ashamed. At her age! Shitty holidays. To think Tiago said he'd take me to Camargue. Worst of all, her ice cream's so good. The skank! Don't I know you? Hi. Are you all okay? You must be joking. You're not in Paris? You didn't know? I guess not, 'cos you never call. So why now? To touch base. Why me? I'll tell you why. 'Cos you don't have the balls to call Mum. 'Cos Léa would make you feel like such a shit... That's not it. But I'll go easy on you. It's not that at all. What is it then? I miss you all. You have no shame? Look, nothing will change. Yeah, as if. You're all mad at me, but later... What about later? We'll get used to it, right? In Syria, they got used to being bombed. In Africa, they got used to AIDS. So why wouldn't we get used to this? After all? Anything else? No? Okay, see you. Shit! Had enough? You're slaughtering it. I hear it scream. I'm the one getting hurt. It's only a tree. No, that's where you're wrong. Almost all of them were planted by me, not the Saracens. It hails, I worry about them. They're sick, I care for them. So no... To me, they're not only trees. You spend more time here than with Granny. And you with your computer? More than with Théo. Only four hectares left. Come on! What? I'm kidding. We'll do them, but not today. Listen up, just so you don't go home stupid. See that one? A grossane. It gives the oil its silkiness. That one's an aglandau. For a little hint of pepper. No other tree is so in harmony with the land. Pollination, for example. Every other tree is pollinated by bees, right? Not these ones. The wind pollinates them. No Mistral, no olives. Isn't that great? Your mother knows. I taught her everything. All for what? For her to have us. You realize what happens in September? You're the new man of the house. You'll have to be strong. See? - You'll have to... - Back off! Wait! What did I say? Stop! Wait for me! Stop! Let it out. Everybody ready for the Capelado, please! An exceptional Capelado. Let's hear it for them! Isn't that Tiago? The bull in the ring is called Bafia. - Can I get another? - Help yourself. Don't your folks feed you? A month without real grub. I need a fix. Sex bombs. Flat as a board. You could fax her. Then again, can I get two sangrias? Hey! Are you French? Visit the bullring? What's up? We're through? Leave me alone. Cut the hysterics. You reject my calls. - What did I do? Ancl Camargue? - Take Magali! Magali's my sister. You didn't know? Come on. - I have to go. - Call me. Seriously, call me. You go home with Gramps and Théo. I... I have to find Adrien. Okay, cool. Maybe I should try to drive. You? You'd run us into the ditch. What? "Gramps mixed water and apricots"? You understand? I'm not the only witness now. You can't let them down. Shit, Paul, what have you done? He'll lose his license? We'll see. "We'll see"? We have to gather evidence. He's drunk! Give him a breath test. Nicolas, did you bring the breathalyser? Silly me, I left it at the station. He can drop by and take it tomorrow. I bet they let him off. What's up? You couldn't sleep? What about Dad? I don't know if he'll be back home. I don't, Théo. I've no idea. That's from Magali's. Let go! It arrived this morning from the Ministry of Agriculture. I thought, take it straight up to Paul. It must be urgent. Where'd I put it? Here it is. See you. You open it. What's going on? My God! You did it! It's yours! I'll go and tell them. Don't worry, it's wonderful! He won first prize! What's this? Right, it's like the Oscar for Best Olive Oil. Don't laugh. You don't know what it means to him. We won the gold medal. You're the best. Thank you. We did it. They're the best. Twenty years. Twenty years! We won the gold medal. There you are, kids. You'll see, it's delicious. I'll be back in five minutes. How's tricks? You're the champ? The talk of the town. To your new friends! And my new enemies. You know the proverb? When you succeed, you have to fight guys who want the same thing, guys who want the opposite thing and guys who want nothing. Good health! Evening. Can I borrow her for a dance? Yes. Here we go. My little Parisienne. - Momo? A jug of water, please. - Here. - Ice? - That's fine. You told our daughter about the medal? Not yet. Because of the time difference. Well? Learning foreign tongues? Check out that cute little butt. Shit, it's Léa. - You do this on purpose? - What have I done now? - What are you wearing? - What about it? You're nuts! Stay out of this. Go home and change. Now! Dream on. I'm fine. Look how you're dressed. It's indecent! My shorts? They're great, huh? Home! That's an order! You're giving me orders now? By what right? Who are you to give us orders? Change your tone. I'm your grandfather. Really? Since when? You've never been there for us. Exactly. If I had been, you wouldn't be making a spectacle of yourself. I know everybody here. You're embarrassing the whole family. You embarrass us. Every day, you're an embarrassment to us! Cut it out now! Let go! Who's making a spectacle of himself? You can hardly stand up! You alcoholic! Stay out of this, I said. They're arguing, that's all. Are you okay? Come on, get me away from that psycho! Sit down. Sweetie, where are you? We're sick with worry. With Tiago. I'm going away for a few days. What'll I tell your mother? I'll call her. Granny? He's the one. I'm sure. I can't do it without you all. I've tried. Frequently. I need your help. You did it at last? Decided to live a bit longer? What about sports? You do any? Recently, I took up skiing. Mornings, maybe a game of football or golf. Evenings, if I'm not too tired ice hockey and tennis. Sure, but I'm doing my best. It all depends. I see. You realize it's not easy? It'll be tough. It'll be an effort every day. Every hour of every day. Every minute of every hour. You understand? I'm ready. Right... It's all well and good, virtual sport, but you need physical exercise, in the real world. Come on, let's go. No stopping at the bistro. Race you? Are you serious? See you at the top. Hi, Paul. Back in the saddle? Let's go for a ride some time. - Absolutely. - I look forward to it. See you, Michel. Isn't he on TV? Sure, why? Let's go. - Okay? Comfortable? - You bet. Cool. Let's go. No. What is it? This way, you'll have no fear. Cheers! Cheers, Paul. Then Mont Ventoux. You were right, from Chalet Reynard... What a view! Look, it's Magali. - Shall we sing? - Without Paul? I could eat a horse after that ride. Or a side of beef. How many of us are there? Léa isn't having lunch? She went camping. Hold on, with Pizzaman? Maybe, why? What? Promise not to blow up. Let's hear it. Swear first. He said he could supply. What? Coke, acid, speed, anything to get you high. The pizza van's a cover. The money's in dope. You promised. You swore even. Hold on... I knew you'd kept it. You don't know where they are. Camargue isn't that big. I can track her down. Show me where they are. Thanks. What's he doing? Move it! Don't do anything stupid! Don't shoot! Where is she? Behind the dune. She's fine. What did you give her? Acid. Not much, honestly. I know what I'm doing. Do you now? Get on your bike and disappear! Got it? I gave her a sedative. It'll take a few days, but she'll be fine. I feel so guilty. You? Guilty? You never put a foot wrong. I wish I could say the same. Can I ask a favour? I won't report it. Thanks. My crazy little girl. Not one text from Tiago, no calls. Not even an apology, nothing. You shook him up? Maybe a bit. Gramps made an impression. Maybe he's just impressionable. There we go. Coming? Go on! Faster! Here, throw a coin in. Go on, it brings good luck. In love? I'm done with love. No more. In your day, why not? Love at first sight, a lifetime together, like Granny and you. Love at first sight's a dumb-ass myth! It wasn't love at first sight? For me, sure. Not for her? She loved another man, who'd just passed away. I was far from Goa when I heard my brother had died. I rode through the night. The gang waited for me for the cremation. Iréne and I carried the torch. That was how it started. To begin with, we fell in love to keep his memory alive. Until we realized we were truly in love. You see? Love takes weird and wonderful paths. Same for you and me. You need to believe in it. Life has more imagination than us. Something's not right. I know. Better with the hat, right? It is with great joy and emotion that I present this certificate to our countryman and friend, Paul Mazuret. On behalf of the village, I give you the olive oil gold medal 2013, with my sincere congratulations. You'll come and see us? The Mistral's died down. Answer me. Will you come? To Paris? You want me dead? Paris, where people say, "It's marvellous. Time here just flies by." I don't want time flying by. I want to see the day slip by. Dawn's pale blue light... High noon... Sunset glowing all around us, like velvet on the Alpilles. In Paris, you get up, you go to bed. You see nothing. I call that a con. - Strawberry cordial. - Be right with you. You know, Théo, this was my best summer ever. Translate. He said, "This was my best summer ever." How do you say "thank you"? What? You told him he was filthy. Like that. - Pizzaman's gone? - Yeah, that's a point. Haven't seen him for ages. Say... Will I find him swimming with the fishes? Don't be so melodramatic. Why not ask his sister? He's left town? Tiago? He opened a restaurant in Ibiza. Damn, that's a shame for us. Got any sandwiches? - How many? - Eight. Lili! Eight sandwiches, please. Come on, let's buy you all a snack for the train. SQ? Finished, the holidays? Back to school now? But hey, holidays keep coming round. So you'll be back. And you know where to find me. Don't you? See you soon. I missed you. Me more. Hey, champ! I'll be here. I know. Beautiful! So, Montreal, you're moving there? I don't know yet. Stay a while. Is that an invitation? You know... Your room's still there. Léa slept in it. Where did you put the boys? In the attic. With the spiders? With the spiders. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling by Eclair Group
