THE NEW MARSHAL ORDERED ALL THE MEN TO GET THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF TOWN. EXPECTING TROUBLE? HE'S GOT LOGAN MAURY'S TOUGHEST KILLER IN JAIL FOR MURDER. MAURY'S CROWD WILL NEVER LET HIM KEEP HIM THERE. WELL, BAT FIGURES THEY'LL TRY TO TAKE HIM. THAT'S HIS PLAN. YOU SEE, DEFENDING THE JAIL GIVES HIM THE LEGAL RIGHT TO DO SOME PLAIN AND FANCY SHOOTING. I DON'T KNOW, MAYOR. THEY'LL BE SHOOTING, TOO. THEY'RE A MURDEROUS CREW. HM! A MURDEROUS CREW TRIED TO RUN DODGE CITY ONCE. AND THEN BAT MASTERSON STEPPED IN. AFTER A WHOLESALE FUNERAL ON BOOT HILL, THE TOWN WENT SUDDENLY PEACEFUL AGAIN. I SAW BILLY BURNS HIGHTAIL IT OUT OF TOWN. WHERE'S HE BOUND FOR? WELL, LOGAN MAURY AND HIS MEN PRACTICALLY DROVE ALL THE FARMERS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. SO BAT FIGURES THEY'D LIKE TO BE IN ON THE KILL. SO HE SENT THE OLD COOT AFTER 'EM. KIND OF A PAUL REVERE, WITH WHISKERS. YEP. NOW YOU GO ON HOME, DAVE, AND GET YOUR RIFLE. AND KEEP OFF THE STREET UNTIL YOU HEAR TWO SHOTS FROM THE TOWER. AND WHEN YOU DO, WHY, COME A-RUNNING AND SHOOTING ANYTHING YOU SEE ON A HORSE. NOW YOU ALL AGREE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTION? -YES, SIR. -YEP. I'LL SPEAK FOR ALL OF US. WE'RE PROUD YOU CAUGHT UP WITH US, BILLY. WE'LL CAMP RIGHT HERE AND KEEP A WATCH FOR YOUR SIGNAL, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. AND WHEN WE SEE IT, WE'LL COME A-RUNNIN'. Man: YEAH! THAT'S PRIME, JASON. LET ME THROUGH, FOLKS. COME ON. Man #2: SO LONG. LISTEN, FELLAS, LISTEN. AS YOU ALL KNOW, THEY'VE GOT OUR PAL LANCE LARKIN IN JAIL FOR MURDER. HE'S AS INNOCENT AS YOU ARE. MASTERSON, WITH THOSE FARMERS BEHIND HIM, WILL LEAD HIM STRAIGHT TO THE GALLOWS. ARE YOU GONNA STAND FOR THAT? -NO! -NO! NO, WE'LL GET LARKIN OUT OF JAIL, WON'T WE, BOYS? GOOD BOYS. I KNEW YOU'D FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT. NOW, LISTEN... WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT, IF A STRAY BULLET SHOULD HAPPEN TO CATCH MASTERSON ACCIDENTLY, I GOT AN IDEA THERE WOULD BE A BIG REWARD FOR A MAN WHO WOULD SHOOT SO BAD. THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, WILSON. GET THEM OUT OF HERE AS SOON AS IT'S DARK. RIGHT. COME ON. LET'S HAVE A DRINK. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] HEY, MASTERSON. YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WERE GONNA STOP MY FRIENDS FROM GETTING ME OUT OF HERE, DID YOU? IF THEY DO, YOU'LL GO OUT FEET FIRST WITH A BULLET RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, AND NOT IN THE BACK, LIKE YOU GAVE McKEON. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] I THOUGHT YOU BOYS MIGHT NEED SOME HELP. THEY WERE MY FATHER'S. WE CAN USE THEM, ALLEN. WE SURE CAN. BUT YOU'D BETTER GET ALONG HOME. THERE'S LIABLE TO BE A LOT OF SHOOTING HERE. WHY, ALLEN HARPER, IF THERE'S ANY SHOOTING TO BE DONE, I BELONG HERE. I CAN SHOOT BETTER THAN YOU CAN ANYHOW. NOW SHE'S TALKING LIKE SAM PRITCHARD'S DAUGHTER. COME ON IN, SUSAN. Ruby: ♪ THINGS THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO SOMEONE ♪ ♪ WHO IS DREAMING OF THEM YET ♪ THROUGH A THOUSAND MEMORIES ♪ THERE IS ONLY ONE REGRET [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] HEY, BOSS. SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG. TRAIL STREET'S EMPTY. NO COVER FOR OUR MEN. I KNOW ALL THAT. THE BOYS SET? THEY'LL HIT TOWN SOON AS IT'S DARK. GOOD. ♪ ALL RIGHT, BOYS. LET'S GO. [ MEN WHOOPING ] [ GUNSHOTS ] FOLKS, THIS IS IT. HYAH! THERE IT IS, MEN. LET'S GET GOING! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Billy: OPEN UP. DEPUTY BURNS REPORTING. [ POUNDING ON DOOR ] WHAT'S THE MATTER? DON'T YOU KNOW I'M ON YOUR SIDE? LET ME IN THERE, ALLEN. GIVE ME SOME SHOOTING ROOM. BAT, I WISH OLD BRANDYHEAD JONES WAS -- QUIET, BILLY. YOU TALK TOO MUCH. ♪ [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] DEPUTY BURNS, TAKE SUSAN AND THE OTHERS OUT THE BACK. WE AIN'T GOING TO -- THAT'S AN ORDER. YOU HEARED WHAT HE SAID. GET TO GETTIN'. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU... YOU KNOW WE AIN'T GONNA GO NO PLACE WITHOUT YOU. I WONDER WHAT IN SAM HILL HAPPENED TO MY FARMERS. I KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO US IF THEY DON'T HURRY UP. ♪ [ GUNSHOTS ] HERE THEY COME! [ GUNFIRE ] [ GLASS SHATTERING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" YOU ONCE TOLD ME THAT IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. THAT GOES FOR WOMEN, TOO, DOESN'T IT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU TURNED AWAY FROM ME FOR SUSAN PRITCHARD, I WAS SO HURT I WANTED TO DIE. BUT I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO NOW. I FEEL NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT IT'D BE SO EASY TO SAY THAT. ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE SAID IT. YES, AND I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY. YOU AND YOUR CRAZY AMBITION ABOUT GREAT HERDS, THOUSANDS OF ACRES, AND TRAINLOADS OF CATTLE HAS EXPLODED. THE FARMERS YOU DROVE FROM THEIR HOMES ARE FIGHTING BACK. RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE RIDING TO A FINISH ON TRAIL STREET. WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT THE FARMERS? I GOT THE LAND AND WIPED OUT HARPER, TOO. YOU HAD THEIR LAND. THOSE DEEDS YOU HELD WERE JUST SCRAPS OF PAPER UNTIL RECORDED AT TOPEKA. DON'T WORRY -- THEY'LL BE RECORDED. THEY'LL NEVER BE RECORDED... BECAUSE I BURNED THEM. AND HERE'S WHAT'S LEFT OF THEM. [ DOOR OPENS ] Carmody: HOLD IT, MAURY. [ GUN CLICKS ] [ GUNFIRE ] STOP SHOOTING, MEN. Man: HOLD YOUR FIRE, BOYS. [ GUNSHOT ] OH, ALLEN, GET DR. EVANS. NO. DON'T LEAVE ME, ALLEN. SUSAN... I ONCE HATED YOU BECAUSE... I THOUGHT YOU ROBBED ME OF SOMETHING THAT BELONGED TO ME. I'M SORRY. I UNDERSTAND, RUBY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT ALLEN AND ME. WE WERE KIDS TOGETHER... RAISED TOGETHER IN A LITTLE TOWN BACK EAST. I RAN AWAY FROM HOME. RUBY... I MUST TELL YOU THIS -- THE FARMERS ARE GONNA GET THEIR HOMES BACK. TELL YOUR MOTHER I'M SORRY. WOMAN KILLER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -HOORAY! HOORAY! -HEY! OH, WAIT A MINUTE! AS MAYOR OF LIBERAL AND SPEAKING OFFICIALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS, I WISH YOU TWO YOUNGSTERS A HAPPY HONEYMOON. HURRY BACK HOME, MR. AND MRS. HARPER. -HOORAY! -HOORAY! Billy: OUT OF THE WAY. GOOD LUCK! I DON'T SEE WHY YOU HAVE TO GO TO NEW YORK FOR A JOB. YOU WASN'T CUT OUT TO BE A -- A JOURNALIST, WHATEVER THAT MEANS. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, SON, I'VE GOT TO TRY BECAUSE I'LL NEVER BE HAPPY IF I DON'T. OH, YOU BELONG IN THE WEST. AND WE NEED YOU RIGHT HERE. BUT YOU'RE IN CHARGE HERE, MARSHAL. SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG CITY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "SOMEDAY"? WE GOT ONE ALREADY. LOOK AT THEM COMING IN. THICKER THAN FLIES AROUND A MOLASSES BARREL. Man: ALL ABOARD! GOODBYE, OLD-TIMER. HERE'S SOMETHING I THINK A LOT OF. BE SURE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT, NOW. Girl: BYE. GOODBYE, BAT. WE AIN'T GONNA FORGET WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR US. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. GOODBYE. -GOODBYE. -GOODBYE. [ GUNSHOT ] [ GUNSHOTS ] HEY! WHOA! [ GUNSHOTS ] HEY! NO FIREARMS ALLOWED IN THE CITY LIMITS. GIVE ME THAT GUN. BRANDYHEAD JONES. I COME TO VISIT YOU, COUSIN WILLY. DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT "COUSIN WILLY" STUFF. I'M THE LAW AROUND HERE.
