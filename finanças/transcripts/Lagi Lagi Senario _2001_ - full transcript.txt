-Are you Malay or Eurasian? -Malay, of course. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you. Is the food here halal? -Yes. -Very good! -You can't go in. -Why can't I go in? Hey, hey. Looking at my clothes, you think I have no money. Don't you look down on me. Look at this man, ladies and gentlemen! -He is one of us. -Sir, sir. You can't come in here because you're not wearing a tie. Come this way. Allow me, miss. Here, sir. Buffet or a la carte? Do you want to eat from the buffet or order from the menu? Just bring me something simple. Honey, this place is beautiful. Of course. It means that I love you. Not just anyone can come here. Here you go. Here you go, miss. What's wrong, honey? Sir, come here. -Yes, sir? Would you like to order now? -Actually, I left my glasses at home. Could you read me the menu? You have it upside down. -Really? -I'd recommend this dish to you. What? Sambal petai? Not sambal petai, sir. I mean pâté from the salmon fish. I'll tell you what. Bring us the most special dish that you have. What are these? They look like snails. These are called escargot. How do I eat them? Come on, honey. Don't tell me, you've never had snails? Are we just going to eat snails? Here you go. -Where's the rice? -We serve French food. There's no rice. -Is it filling? -Why don't you try it first? It's not bad. Bon appetit. What? It means, enjoy your food. Please, go ahead. Bring me some chili sauce, please? -Why are you asking for chili sauce? -It's not hot enough. Wait a minute. Who is this? Calm down. He's the owner as well as the cook of the place. He doesn't like people tampering with his dish. I just want a little chili sauce. It'll taste better. This is too much! -I hope you've had your mouth insured! -Calm down, miss. Why don't you have a seat first? I did. What do I care? There are better restaurants out there. Why don't you feed this to cats? What are you waiting for? Go away! Do you speak… 'Azlee's Special Roti Stall' -Drinks? -Two teh tarik. -Food? -Roti canai crushed with curry. Sit here. Ready! Hey--- Saiful, two roti kapas. To go, please. To go? Why won't you eat here? -It's hot here. -I can fan you. Hey, boy! The check! -Two-fifty. That's all? -Yes. -Don't you have a smaller note? -This is all I have. Take it. -There's a small problem. -Why is there a problem? Just give me the change. Ah, you don't even have change for this. -Two-fifty. -What's that? He's so snobbish. Just give me the coins. Let his trousers fall down. Tell him I don't have change. -We don't have change. -No change? Then is it on the house? My boss said you can pay another day. Hey, you there! Don't forget to pay me that RM2.50. It's okay if you don't pay. I like to do charity too. If you want to eat for free, don't hesitate to drop by. You don't have to shout. He said he has money, but actually doesn't. Would you like some more drinks? -Why does he lie about that? -Nowadays, everybody lies. Look, you can't even believe what's in the paper. If you don't believe it, then why do you read it? There's one thing you can trust though. -4D numbers. -Hey. -Yasin, buy me ten cans of condensed milk. -We've run out of eggs too. And 30 eggs. -Wait a minute. I need pen and paper. -What for? -To write it down or I'll forget. -It's only two items, you won't forget! Here. Not keep the change. Ten milk tins. Ten milk tins. Thirty eggs. Ten milk tins. Thirty eggs. Drink, sir? -Iced lime tea, not too sweet. -Food? In a while. What are you doing here? -I went to the toilet. -Don't give me such excuses. -I know you were trying to skip work. -If so, would I wear this stupid costume? You are paid to wear this stupid costume. If you don't like it, you can leave. There are many out there who'd love to have this job. Go back to your place. Ten cans of milk, 30 eggs-- Ten cans of milk, 30 eggs-- CORN CRISPS Ten cans of milk, 30 eggs-- Do you want to buy this? What's that for? Do you want to buy or not? No. Oh no! What was I supposed to buy? Ten kilos of sugar, 30 sacks of rice. It's not that. This is all the lizard's fault! -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. A lizard replying to the "salam." Do you remember what I'm supposed to buy? -Milk and eggs. -Thank you, Mr. Lizard. Come to my stall when you have the time. You can sample our food. -Sir! Are you the owner of the stall? -No, I'm just a worker. -Do you have eggs? -Yes. Huh? They're over there. -Over there. -Ah, thank you. Ten eggs, forty-- ah! It's him, Dad. Hey! Did you scare my children? How dare you! My bag, my clothes… "Wahid, you've failed to pay the rent for six months, so, you're not allowed to enter this house anymore." -Someone threw a baby there. -What? -Someone threw a baby there. -Baby? Where? Wait. Wait a minute. This is not a baby. He's old enough to be a father. What's with you. Sir, wake up. Why are you sleeping here? This is not a bedroom. This are business premises. It's Mr. Lizard! I worked as a waiter for three years at an exclusive restaurant. But because of someone else, I was fired. I tried to find work at several other restaurants but many have closed down because of the economic crisis. And that's why I stopped. That-- Not only was I fired, I also received a fist here. So now, I'm all alone. I've no work, no home. -Poor thing. -Is that all? Help him. How? You said you want to find another worker to help me here. He used to work at a posh restaurant. Our stall is so small. Would he like it here? That's true. But I think, he'll accept if we offer for him to be Mr. Lizard. After that, we can promote a new menu. Lizard soup. That's true. -Who would eat lizard soup? -Calm down. Let's ask Mr. Wahid. Mr. Wahid, would you like to work here? -Are you trying to tear down my stall? -I'm sorry. Do you have insurance? How dare you! You haven't even started yet and you're being overly friendly. I know you've worked at a posh restaurant but you shouldn't assume that my stall is only for beggars. My customers are not only beggars, there are also bankers, corporate people too. If you don't like it here, you can leave. In a while, people from the stock exchange will come here to have a drink. What are you waiting for? Please go. Why are you being so touchy? The guy's in trouble. Mr. Wahid! You could at least have a drink first. We Malaysians are very fortunate. Chinese can eat Malay, Malay can eat Indian. There are no cannibals here. I don't mean that. Chinese like Malay rice in coconut milk, Malay like Chinese yong tau fu, and everybody likes roti canai and that's Indian. That's true but there's one thing all Malays, Chinese and Indians cannot eat. -Really? -Yes! But they like to put it in their mouth. -What is it? -One cigarette, please. May I take your order, miss? -What is your specialty? -Everything's special here. You can look at the menu over there. Allow me to recommend the sardine roti. Delicious pastry with sardine filling fresh from the can. Or you can order our roti kapas, so soft and crunchy on the outside, it'll melt anyone who tries it. Or you can order the most wonderful item on the menu, the peliau pratha pastry. The peliau pratha pastry? or, egg roti. Make me two sardine rotis, two roti kapas, and six egg rotis, to take away. I don't want. -When can you start? -I already have. -The same pay as Yasin? -It's a deal. What are you waiting for? Get to work. This is Azlee's house. We're living here at the moment. -Come in, make yourself at home. -But be careful with the furniture! What's wrong with him? I think he doesn't like me. He's like that, but he's all right once you get to know him. Wow! Outside, it's a squatter house, but in here, it's like a condominium! Of course, we live in Kuala Lumpur, we have to have good taste. Azlee's very generous towards his workers. Did he pay cash for them? This stuff is not Azlee's. So, who does it belong to? The television set is the only thing which is not mine. The rest belongs to Saiful. -He paid cash for them. -So his parents are rich? -Who? -Saiful. He's rich but not his parents. Don't joke with me. Don't tell me he bought all this with his salary as a roti maker? Why not? Don't just look at my skinny body. Behind this macho face, there lies a hidden talent. My God! You're a gigolo! How dare you! Get up! You can't sit on my sofa! Calm down. He just didn't understand. Actually, everything in this house was bought by Saiful with his salary as roti canai maker. You two are very funny! Why don't you apply for the Sinaran show? you have a stinky mouth. Here you go, take this. Wahid bin Mohamad, in a short while, a fact will be revealed to you, it will shock you. A fact that will change your perspective on this challenging life. This is neither lie nor fiction. It's the truth, nothing but the truth. Do you believe that a roti maker makes more than a grave digger? -What grave digger? -Just to spice things up. I don't believe you. The work is so easy yet you make so much. You think it's easy? Have you tried it before? No. But what's so hard about it? Knead some dough, turn it around in the air. Then cook it on the pan. It's easy. -I'd like to see you do it. -It is very hard, Wahid. I've tried it, it didn't turn out well. Listen to that. The skill of making roti canai is possessed only by a chosen few. And I'm one of them. Imagine this. Thick dough can't be broken. I will roll and roll. I will knead and knead. I will pinch and pinch. I will shape and shape it. Then, the bread will be made by strong hands. fingers that follow the rhythm this dough is like silk flying like a piece of cloth in Erra Fazira's soap advertisement. I'll fold over the dough. I'll flatten and flatten it then I will lay it upon a kuali that is hot and oily then it will produce a wonderful aroma whetting everyone's appetite that's how a work of art is made. We come up with a masterpiece called. -Roti-- -Canai. I don't want. It's quite difficult to make. Two iced tea and two roti canai. RM3, sir. Thank you. Calm down, brother. I'm a businessman. This story is not good. -I have better ones. -What? -Take a look. -Oh my-- -Don't let the others see them. -These are pirated DVDs! Don't talk too loud. -Others will hear you. -They're illegal. Yes, but selling them is not. What are the movies that you have? What do you want? Hollywood? Bollywood? Malay movies? In color and also black and white. Even those with only one color. One time? This is a good movie, action movie. It'll be playing in the US next month. -Is it clear? -Sure. L.D. DVD copy. I'm not keen about this. Here, here. Hindustani films. Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Kublai Khan. Do you have any Malay movies? Yes, I have. What movie is this? It's a comedy, a big hit in Malaysia. Can I try it? Can? Hey, hey, hey. Take only one. Not bad. Can I move it forward. Can, can. You see people like this, you think they have no money? See hear, gentlemen. He's one of ours, one of ours. -Here, here -Sir. What's this? That's me and that's you. It's not faulty. It's just that the movie is not ready yet. How dare you try to sell me an unfinished movie! Go away! So, at last you've decided to modify the stall? -No, I haven't. -So, what are they doing? Peace be upon you. I'm Mazlan. This is my niece, Lin and that is my assistant, Maya. What are you waiting for? Give them out! Is it tasty? Here, here, please, please, please. "Advanced Taste Cafe?" -What's this? -Can't you read? Are you going to open a new stall here? Yes. Don't you know that there's a stall here. Yes, I know. Can't we open another one? Help me carry the stuff over there. Bring them down slowly. I want to build it here. Why are you doing this? Be careful. Otherwise you'll hurt your leg. Those people are so bad. We already have a stall here. But we're the fortunate ones. If the service is bad here, we can go over there. If both are bad? We open our own stall. What a good idea! Whatever. What is it? It's even worse. Please think of something. What are we going to do now? We should've done something a long time ago. You're right. I agree. -Do what? -What do we do, Wahid? Pretend not to know anything. Don't play around with this. This is about our livelihood. When they open for business, we'll be in trouble. Why don't we tear it down? Isn't that a sin? It's a sin. Don't you remember how he smiled at us? I hate his face. Luckily the girl touched my cheek. Think positive. With the new stall next to us, we'll work harder. Work harder? Do you want us to work all the time? -No, I mean the quality. -Quality? Mutusamy, that customer of ours. I mean the quality of our work. We have to improve starting from tomorrow. We'll give an extra special service to our customers tomorrow. And we give them the sweetest of smiles. We'll bring the stall down! -Lift. -Okay. First, wait. Wait. Ouch. Where is he? Blockhead. You go over there. This is mine. Move! Are you trying to kill me? -Ouch! -Feel that! Ouch, ouch. That hurts. -I have tummy ache. -You ate too much. Our stall. Hey, help us. I don't know what I ate just now. How did that thing get there? Ah, done. Who are you? Eh, how long have you been keeping it? He could be from the next stall. Let me see your face. You built the thing, right? We were tearing it down. Leave it, leave it. Leave him alone. Saiful, you can go now. Yes! We're free to go! -Just Saiful. -Just me? What about us? Yes, it's me. -What are you doing here? -I'm the one who bailed you out. Let's go. AZLEE'S SPECIAL ROTI STALL Where are they? -Peace be upon you, Mr. Mazlan. -Peace be upon you, Mr. Azlee. -Aren't you doing business today? -No, I told the boys to take the day off. What are you doing? Just something to ward off bad luck, so that both our businesses will flourish. -Thank you. -Good. -Thank you so much. -But what is he doing with-- Look at the man. He's not your regular shaman. He can cure illness, prevent it, give it to someone, he can do it all. But we're supposed to pray to God. Are you insinuating something? No, I'm just saying that we shouldn't believe in superstition. We can lose our way. How dare you? Did you just called me a loser? No, I didn't. I said "Aren't you all lost here? Many people are looking for a few who are lost." But-- Mr. Mazlan, I've put a fence around this stall. Those kids or anyone else won't be able to do anything now. What kids? How could you do this? -If you didn't bail Saiful out, who did? -I don't know. I just wonder why Mr. Mazlan didn't sue you. He must be afraid. Why should he? You're the ones who committed the crime. What's that? Wow. -When did the night market shift there? -That's not a night market. Seems like Mr. Mazlan has opened his business. He has a lot of customers. We're dead. OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE SENSATIONAL STALL FREE FOOD AND DRINKS Azlee, come over to my stall. It's the launch tonight! The food is free! Free food? What are we waiting for? Don't embarrass me. Haven't I fed you well all this while? Saiful, make a special roti canai for that brother. A special roti canai for that brother! There's Saiful! Why can he? Why can't I? Stop. Wait, he's not eating. What are you doing here? -What's going on here? -Why is Saiful here? Calm down, Mr. Azlee. Come in and have a hot coffee first. Saiful, go and make that roti canai. Forget about it. I've had enough of his roti canai. I don't want to be your enemy but you seem hell bent on spoiling my launch. Let's not fight. So, what if he borrows Saiful for a night? Saiful is my worker now. His worker? Please tell me that it's not true! Tell me! Tell us what it is! I work here now. You can't blame me. He was offering me more money, so I accepted. How could you do this to me? All this time, I've taken good care of you. But today, you stab me in the back. What? Didn't I pay you enough? -It was enough. -So? But I want more! -You're greedy! -Calm down, Yasin! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, Wahid! Let me go, Wahid! It's nothing. We were only acting. Drink, have a drink. -I feel sorry for that man. -Me too. -My brother went through the same thing. -What happened to him? He had a fiancée. A month before their marriage, the girl went off with another man. What a bad fellow. Very badly behaved man. Why are you mad at me? She liked me, what could I do? What are you doing here? Go there and sing. Roti, roti, roti. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Mr. Mazlan was right. You're defending him? Why don't you go and work there too? Relax, will you? That's only one extra stall and you're already crying. What if there are more? Are you going to roll on the ground? No. Go home. Come to work tomorrow. How are we going to open tomorrow? Who's going to make the roti? Welcome, miss, come in, miss. You're so beautiful. Come on in, miss. Welcome, miss. Brother, welcome. Come have a seat. What do you want to eat? Any drinks? -There's a new stall over there. -Quite a crowd they have there. The food must be good. Miss, miss. Go ahead. I hope you'll have stomachache after eating Saiful's roti canai. Roti? Maya, please make a drink for this brother. What would you like? You? Saiful, make three special roti for the brothers. Okay, ready. Don't you feel guilty? Guilty? Why? -Look at your former boss' stall. -Why should I feel guilty? It's business. Sometimes you make money, sometimes you don't. But they're not making money because of you. What's it to you? It's your uncle who's making money. What's going on? How's your new house? Good, let me know if you need anything. Maya! Take good care of Saiful. Make sure he gets anything he needs. -Anything? -Anything! Saiful. Please come to my stall. We're having a special offer today. Free Coca-Cola for everyone. My offer is better! Free Coca-Cola and Nescafe! Everyone will get Coca-Cola and ginseng coffee for strength! Wait, wait, wait. I'm giving out Eurycoma coffee for men and women! Come over! Come, come. Come in, enter, enter. Here, here, here, come in. Maya, take their orders fast! Saiful, hurry up! Strategy, huh? My friend went into the jungle and found a big Eurycoma plant. How big was it? -This big. -That's big. Since then, he has hit his wife every day. I bet she likes him very much. She's been in the ICU five times. Why? He hit her with the Eurycoma stick. Please sit. -What do you want to drink? -Something strong. I'm sorry. We don't sell that. Don't you have strong coffee? You're quite a joker. Please make an egg roti for that guy. -Here you are. Enjoy your food. -Thank you. -What's this? -Please don't eat that. -Why? -What's going on here? -The roti-- -What's wrong with it? Ask Saiful. Excuse me. What's wrong with the roti. I don't know. I did it like usual. -Hey, don't! -Huh? It looks fine to me. What's wrong with it? I think it's better than usual. You're such a troublemaker, Lin. Saiful, make another special roti for the brother. That's it? What about my broken heart? Sensitive, aren't you? Of course. I do my work with honesty. Hey, you. I saw you do it just now. What did you see? You like to make trouble for others. Apologize to Saiful, quick. What? Apologize? Apologize to him quickly. -Why should I? -In that case, I quit. Please don't! You've disobeyed me, your uncle! Apologize to him, quick! -Or I'll send you back to Tanjung. -I'm sorry. Stubborn nephew. Go back to work. This roti is actually very good. Mr. Azlee, bye! My head is hurting. I keep hearing the sound of the pins falling! -I hear it too. -You too? Did you hear? Of course we hear it. My mind is getting worse thinking of my darkening future. Calm down. Mazlan only opened his stall a day ago. We can't give up yet. We have to accept the fact that Azlee is going through a bad patch. Yes, but we can help him. But how? We can't even help ourselves. Why are you so sad? Who died? I-- Innalillahiwainnaialaihirojiun. Hey, you too? -I want to leave this place. -Why? Life is not like Hindi movies. Most of the time, it's more like Malay movies. And in Malay movies, the hero doesn't win all the time. Even if he wins, no one cares because… no one's watching anyway. Please forgive me. So, what about Azlee? Don't you feel sorry for him? If I feel sorry for him, who's going to feel sorry for me? Please drink. The bill, please. RM2.40. It's okay. It's on me. -Oh, it's his treat. -Thank you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -How much did we collect today? -It was supposed to be RM2.40. I've tried looking for a roti canai maker but it's all in vain. Luckily I have you and Yasin. I feel like I can't do business anymore. No matter what happens, I will not leave you. -Where's Yasin? -Yasin-- Come in, come, enter. Sit. Wait a moment, please. What are you doing here? Come. Take their order. Yasin. -Why is he there? -This is too much! This kid has the gall. You silly oaf, come here! -Don't do that. -Be patient. -Where are you going? -Azlee! Enough, Azlee! Hey, hey, hey. What's this? You've gone too far! I've lost my patience! I'm through with you! You're always losing your temper! I didn't force them to work here. They came of their own free will. Help! Stab me in the back! Maybe then you'll be happy! That's enough, Azlee! Yasin, how could you do this to Azlee! I'm sorry. There's no need to apologize! No one's to blame in this case. Today is your day but I'll make sure that tomorrow and the days that follow are mine! I'll fight you till the end! AZLEE'S SPECIAL ROTI STALL -The time has come. -Huh? Where are we going to start? Look at your former boss. He thinks that he can defeat me. Ouch. If the thing is rotten, you can put tons of paint on it, but it'll still be rotten. Even if his stall looks as nice as the KLCC, if he doesn't know how to do business then what's the use? Come again. -Have a seat. -It's all right. I'm looking for Azlee. -Which Azlee? -Azlee, the stall owner. There's only Mazlan, the cafe owner. -Azlee is over there. -Thank you. Hey! Why did you do that? -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. I'm Majid, a roti canai maker. Good, good, good. Wahid, this is the maker of our roti canai. Here's the paint. Come over here. This is the last. Let's go. -There. -There. Come have a drink at my stall. Come to Azlee's traditional stall, famous for many years-- Come in, sir. Come to my cafe. We have all sorts of roti. My roti is more original, made by a specially flown in roti master. What's going on? How could this happen? You never should've bragged yesterday. Shut your mouth! You have to do something, Saiful. You've to make better roti than theirs. Useless. Seems like we made the wrong move. Who? Me? I didn't. You did. Azlee has helped us a lot but when he was in trouble, we made it worse for him. Look at him now, he can live without us. You think Mazlan will keep quiet? He has many tricks under his sleeve. Yes, like the trick you used to get Saiful. What's it to you? Go in and do some cooking. -Is it true, Maya? -What? That your love for me is nothing but a trick? Who said that? I love you. Don't listen to the mad girl. Now, your job is to make the best roti canai around, better than what they have over there. Ouch. Two teas, please. This roti is really nice. -Really? -Really. Give me one more. -One more roti canai! -Coming! Go ahead, go ahead. Mr. Mazlan, how's business today? Now you know who I am. Soon, you'll have to call it quits. Please, please, please. Go ahead. What's the matter? What's this? Where are you going? Sit down! Come in! -What happened? -This is what happens when you brag. Majid, your pay for today. You don't have to come back tomorrow. -You give me leave after only a day? -Yes, a very long leave. Not again. I'm being fired again. It's bitten me everywhere, it won't stop. Saiful! Remember, make the roti canai well. Don't do like them, dirty people! Not just that. We have to watch our cook too. She can't be trusted. -Watch your mouth. -Why are you being so touchy? Do you see any other cook here? She's just giving you advice. That woman giving me advice? She can keep it. I'd rather listen to a monkey. How rude! How dare you compare me to a monkey! Hey, enough, enough. Patience, patience! Don't meddle in women's affairs. If they fight here, it'll be bad for my business. Apologize to her. That's enough. From now on, I won't apologize to anyone unless it's my fault. You're at fault. Now, apologize. You want to see me create trouble. Now, I apologize. -Where are you going? -To look for a job! -But this is where you work! -I quit! You two shut up. From now on, this is where I work. Move aside. -Which one? -There are too many people there. -Let's go to the other stall. -Let's go, let's go. -Welcome to Azlee's stall. -What would you like to drink, sir? We have the classic Coca Cola. You don't want this either? You don't want gassy drinks? We have the exotic rozelle juice. Whatever then. -What do you want to eat? -Egg roti. -We don't have that. -Then what do you have? We have fried rice, fried noodles, fried instant noodle, hailam noodle and bandung noodle. -I want one hailam noodle. -Hailam noodles. And I want one fried instant noodle, make it really spicy. -We don't have all that. -Then go and buy it! Hurry up, the customer's waiting. Hurry! Have a taste. The check, please. It's all right. I'll do it. -There's something fishy. -What? Maybe this food is poisoned. I don't care. It's quite tasty. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Why do you want to work here? I need a change. Don't lie! I know that Mazlan sent you here to spy on us. So, now you know. That means my job here is done. I can send a report to Uncle Mazlan so he doesn't have to worry because this stall is really hopeless. What did I tell you? I don't have time to spy for anyone. I came here because I can't stand to work there anymore. Why? Did they torture you? No, I don't want to talk about that anymore. From now on, we'll work hard to make this stall successful, okay? It's the Senario! Hurry! -Wahid! -Thank you. Our cafe is blessed today. Maya, hurry! Get the camera! If I'm not mistaken, you're Mazlin, right? Mazlin from Form 5, Art Stream 2, Sri Pantai School in Kampung Kerinchi. I thought so. -I would have guessed! -Senario! How are you? Good. Please come in! -What are you doing here? -I work here. You work here? -Really? From the same gang? -We are friends from school. Come over here! It's my friend's stall! Hang out here! This is my friend's stall! -Let's go there. -Where do you want to go? He's going over there instead! This is my ex-classmate. I used to tease her but luckily she's nice. This is Azlee, the owner of the stall. I-- I-- He stutters. No, he doesn't stutter, he's just a bit surprised to see you all here. He's Senario's biggest fan. What about you? Me, of course. I'm a huge fan, I'd watch all your shows and laugh. I have all of your movies and sitcoms. the one I really can't wait for is the new one, Lagi-Lagi Senario. I'm a Senario fan too. My name is Mazlan. I'm the owner of that stall over there. Lin is my niece. To show you my appreciation, I'm going to serve you special roti canai. Hurry up, hurry, bring it over. Our special roti, our special roti. Saiful. Look at you. I think I've seen his face before. But where? It's possible. Are you Indonesian? Don't you remember the dialog in Senario Lagi? Do you think I'm a Senario fan? Go and make some drinks for them. Please be patient. I apologize for calling you a spy. It's all right. You don't have to apologize. So, you come this way every night? -Aren't you afraid? -No. What if a bad man comes along and grabs you? -Let him do it if he dares. -You're so brave. Yes, I am because many people come here to fish. Come. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. You just got off work? Sometimes I sit here watching them fish. -Wahid. -Yes? -Do you like fishing? -No, I mean, I've never done it. -I don't usually fish. -Oh. Maybe you like fishing for other stuff. That's not nice. Have you ever tried to woo a girl? Pick up girls? Yes. But that was in the past, when I was very young. -Did you get her? -What? Did you manage to get her? That fish, in front over there. Not every girl likes me. But there must be a few. Yes, there were. But the feeling wasn't mutual. So, you're choosy. Well, it's not wrong, is it? It's not easy to find a partner in life. Unlike that guy over there. How do you know? Let's say that you meet a girl that you like and she likes you back… I know. I mean, I must be the luckiest man alive. It's just that I'm not ready. Why are you so stupid? She likes you so why are you being so difficult? I'm not ready because I want to make it in life first. I want to get a job that gives me security for my future so that I can make my wife happy. You got a fish! Azlee, today, we must make roti canai. -What's with you? -I can make roti canai. -Are you sure? -I can even dance with it. Don't you believe me? I'll show it to you. -Really? -Yes, it's the truth. -Okay. -I'm doing it well. I'll try it soon, you'll see. I've practiced the whole day and night. I didn't even sleep. Yasin, send the drink to this table. WARNING: ROTI CANAI FLIES LIKE ROCK & ROLL The roti is flying! Please, please, come on, go ahead. Come and sit. -Come, come, come, sit, sit. -Take your seats, take your seats. -Please, please. -It's alright. I can't any more, girl. Come and sit. Saiful, you must make one like that. -Maya, put on a song. -What song? A rock song. Rock song. We don't have any rock songs. We only have dangduts. Put it on. Come here! The roti is ready! Wait a minute. There. -May I help you? -One of those rock & roll flying roti. They're already sold out. -Everthing's finished? -We're sold out already. -But we'll have more tomorrow. -Tomorrow? Don't you want to try the stall next door? -It's all right. I don't like their roti. -You don't like it? -Make me one tea, please. -Go ahead, sit. Thank you, Wahid. You've saved me. From now on, ask me anything you want, as long as you don't quit. Please, please, please. I want you to use your trick. It's always me. Isn't there anyone else to carry out your dirty tricks for you? Watch your mouth. Here you go. Azlee, please forgive me. Please, punish me. Please take me back. I forgive you. From now on, you'll be working for me again. Hi, Wahid. Wahid. Seems like the small snake has grown into a dragon. This dragon goes to school. He doesn't buy the words of a snake with a forked tongue. Please, please, please, welcome, welcome. Welcome, please, come in, please. Flying roti jala, ready! Here, yes. Please, welcome. What's this thing in my curry? Where did you find the cockroach? What are you asking me for? -Who made the curry? -I did. -Who's the owner? -I am. You're such a dirty man! And this guy is the same too. He's even more dirty. Didn't you guys see him go to the toilet just now? Then, without washing his hands, he kneaded the dough and served it to you. -Why are you pulling me into this? -You're the bad one, you know. Be patient, sir. This is all a misunderstanding. I'm not as dirty as you think. Tell me how the cockroach got there! Tell me! I don't care! I'm going to sue you! Let's not wait, my friends. This is a dirty place. Let's go to the next stall. It's cleaner. What are you waiting for? Let's go! Wait a minute! Be patient. We can't trust this man just like that. What do you know? You're a woman! What are you doing here? Go to the back! I bet you were paid to spoil Azlee's business. Don't listen to her. She's a spy. And you're a spy for Uncle Mazlan. Who said so? There's no witness, no proof. I'm a witness and I have the proof. Destroyers of a place in which people come to eat. -Go away! -If you come here again, you're done for. Where's your boss? There you are! Trying to hide from me? What's this? Who are you? I don't know you. I've done my job. Pay me now. Come back and work for me. I don't mind either. You deserve it more. It's all right. Thank you. What a dirty man! How did this thing happen to be in my roti canai? It's your teeth. My teeth? I didn't realise it was my tooth. Take this. I quit. What are we going to do? We haven't got a single customer since yesterday. If it's like this every day, we'll go bankrupt. Who's going to go bankrupt? That word doesn't exist in my life. If you insist, I'll send you back to Penang. It's better for me to go back to Penang, than to see your face every day. I can't stand it anymore. Useless. What are you laughing at? GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT Peace be upon you all. I, as the religious leader entrusted by the nation's leaders without a doubt and with confidence declare that the moon for the fasting month has been sighted. Hence, with this I declare that the fasting period begins tomorrow. Fast, don't not fast. "We are considering you for the managerial post at our international restaurant which will open soon at Johor Baru. Please come to our office for an interview." What do you think? This is your life, your future, Also for your future so, you have to decide. What about the stall? What about the stall? Everyone would understand but, Wahid, you have to make the right decision. Where's the place? -At the back. -Okay. Have you finished? Correct. Hurry, make the drinks. We've waited a long time. My friend's father. Don't you have any fans? It's hot. Here, fan yourself. -Only the newspaper? -Send water. Fried noodles? -Fried noodles. -Over here. Baldie. -Here, fried noodles. -Sit there. Come and wipe this. Sit, sit, sit. Thank you. Come and sit over here. Sit, sit, sit. -We're from the Religious Department! -Oh no! Help! Please, sir. Please. "I swear that I'm fasting. I'm innocent. I was framed." Suddenly Maya came in. "Yasin is innocent, sir. Mazlan is the guilty one. He forced us to serve the people who weren't fasting." After interrogation, it was proven that I was innocent. Then, what happened to Uncle Mazlan and Maya? I think they've been fined. That's here on earth, in the hereafter, it's worse. Let's just hope that they'll repent. It's almost time for breaking fast. Do your work. You think you can get away with this? We're in the fasting month. We shouldn't be fighting. I don't care. If I'm going down, you're going down with me. I'll fall now. Satisfied? Oh, you're being sarcastic, yeah. What are you doing? Ouch! Hide! Hide! Take this! How dare you! He's throwing bigger rocks. Go ahead and take it! -Ouch. -Do you want to go to the clinic? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Forgive me, Lin. -It's all right. It's all right. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you. May I see the owner? That will be me. I'm sorry, we're not open yet. Good, that means, I'm not too late. This is my card. Fatimah Rahmat, land attorney. This is the letter. -What letter is this? -It's the land title for this area. I'm authorized to reclaim the land on behalf of the owner. The landlord? But I was told that no one owned the land. I've been doing business here for years. Nobody came to claim it. But now, they have. -And the land has been bought. -Who? Look, Lee Ah Chai and Muthusamy. I've heard those names before. But where? Those are my customers. They are my clients, the landowners. -So how? -I understand. They've just won on the lottery and bought this land. They want to tear down the stall and build a big restaurant here. What? Destroy it? -My stall is saved! -That stall will have to go too. They have demolished the stall! What will my wife and children eat? -I bet he's behind all this. -Traitor! Don't get in my way. How could you stab us in the back? -Stab you in the back? -Saiful. You said you'd repented. But now, you've destroyed our business. What's that for? I started to feel something for you. I thought you were a good man. You turned out to be the worst I've ever met! -What have I done? -Go back to your bosses! Wait a minute. Who said that they are my bosses? You were talking to them. It doesn't mean that I'm working for them. I was congratulating them because they are going to open a restaurant here. You get lost! You're done for. You useless kid. Wait, I haven't finished. Enough said! Hold on. Hold on. I told you that I want to correct my mistakes. Wait, wait, wait. What is that letter? Here it is. I got a new place and this is the permit for us to do business. New place? With the money that I saved, I bought a piece of land. I hope that at the new place, we can do business together and go through the good and the bad together. What do you say? He's so smart in the head. You're so smart, yeah? Catch him! Grab him! Grab him! Come in! Selamat hari raya!
