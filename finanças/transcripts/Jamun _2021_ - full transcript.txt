Yay! -Just one round, today. -No. One more please. We'll do this again tomorrow. Right here. Check this one. Can't find it here either. This side. This side. Can't seem to find house 207's meter. How's that possible? Tell me the meter number. It ends with 5746. 5746... 5746... Here it is. Go upstairs and tell them that we'll be disconnecting the electricity line. Brother, you finished yet? Your shirt is ready. Yeah... Here she is. Is Jamun Prasad home? No, sir. Dad has left for his clinic. We have to disconnect your electricity line. Your payments are overdue. - Payments have been made. My brother had... - It's been pending for three months. Well, you should ask your brother if he actually made the payments. Sir... I forgot to mention... Dad just stepped out to get money from the ATM. We'll definitely make the payment today. Please don't disconnect the power line. Do ensure that the payment is made today, or we'll disconnect the line tomorrow, without notice. Amar Prasad. Amar Prasad or Amar Kumar Prasad? Yes, Amar Kumar Prasad. You forgot your surname? Their tax records for the past year have been verified. It's not possible to approve a loan for these IDs. All set? Look, the thing is... Your loan can't be approved. -Huh? -What? Based on your credit history, it's almost impossible. It was all fine till yesterday. So, today we came here for the final approval. What happened overnight suddenly? Sir, this is not right. For the past 10 days, we've done everything you told us to. And now I am telling you something new. Don't give me that crap. Are we getting the loan amount in cash or will it be transferred to the account? Sir, your loan can't be approved. Sorry. It can't be approved? Why not? I told you it can't be done. We can't be dishing out loans to any random person off the street. You think I'm a person off the street? Huh? C'mon... Listen, you try again after six months. I'll personally approve your loan. I assure you. Fuck you and your assurances. Aye, mind your language. -Tell him to watch his mouth. -Bro, calm down. -I'm tired of this fucking crap. -I'm helping- Fuck you. You had called us here to approve the loan. I'll get even your fucking daddy to approve the loan. Watch your fucking mouth, and don't talk shit about my father. I'll talk shit about you and your entire fucking chimp family. Oh yeah? I'm not giving you the loan. Bro, stop... Listen... -Bro? -Yeah? How did you cook up that story about a dairy farm? Randomly, man. Whatever came into my head. You could've said something better. Restaurant? Pharmacy? Anything. C'mon bro. There go away our dreams of settling in Dubai. And we got a thrashing from that fucking chimp. Bro, you ruined it by intervening. Otherwise, I would have yanked out every hair off that chimp's swinging skull. Leaving him bald for the rest of his life. Bro, relax. And Take it Easy. So my distant uncle is inaugurating his salon today. Let's go there and stuff ourselves with some good food. And we'll top it off with a free facial. -Want to go? -Yeah. Now, open up your palm. Son, this locking up happens not in the joints but in the brain. If you tell the brain that you have arthritis... then that's exactly what the body will follow. Sir, that's exactly what I tell him as well. But he doesn't listen. Does he? Nope, not at all. The kid is talking sense. It's all in the mind. You should get him some fresh air more often. We do. But lately, it's not been as often as before. -How come? -Just got a little occupied... -Hmm...occupied? -Just been a little hectic, that's all. Mr. Neelkanth, the grandson's growing up. Keep an eye on him. Take this prescription. Take each medicine, three times a day. Take this outside to Jagat. He'll give you the medicines. -And your fee? -You can give that to him as well. All set? Take the medicines on time. I'll see you in two weeks. Yes, surely. Namaste. Take care of yourself Mr. Neelkanth. Don't forget to exercise in the outdoors. Sir, I'll accompany him. Go alone if your grandson can't accompany you. -Namaste, Mr. Damodar. Come in. -How are you, Mr. Jamun? All good. Please have a seat. Sorry, I couldn't join you on the walk today. Yes, I was waiting... I wanted you to meet Mr. Ashok. He's a wedding mediator. The photos I took from you - of your daughter, Chetna - were given to him. So, the boy is a Branch Manager in Andhra Bank. -Manager right? -Yes. -Yeah. A branch manager, working in Trichy. Mr. Damodar I would much rather prefer the groom to be from this city. Why send my daughter to another home in such a far way city? Mr. Jamun also has a son, an engineering graduate. Please find some suitable options for him as well. Yes, certainly. This is what I do for a living. First, let's find a suitable groom for the daughter. -I'll muti-task. Don't you worry. -All right. Have a look at the boy's pictures. Here you go. The boy isn't exactly pleasing on the eye. CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation... is used to bring back consciousness to a person who has collapsed. If this sticky situation arises, do not get confused. Performing a CPR should be the first step. First check the breathing of the patient. Check the responsiveness of the patient. If the patient doesn't respond- I've been waiting for you since forever. Class ran late. Wait a second. I'll be back. -Sorry. -It's okay. Why are you panicking? No, I just thought it'd be best if you were alone with Amit. Want to join us to the zoo? It'll be fun. I'd rather not be the third wheel. You guys go. Have fun. Anyway, I've to go pay the electricity bill. They came to disconnect the line today. -Again? -Yeah. -My brother didn't pay the bill. -Oh okay. -Should I drop you somewhere? -No, it's fine. He's waiting. You go ahead. -You sure? -Positive. See you. Bro, why don't you join in? This is the best face-pack they got. And it's free for us. -I'm good, bro. -Suit yourself. I hope you enjoyed your meal. C'mon, Uncle. My entire face pack dried up waiting for you. -How are you, son? -Great. It was fun. You've opened up a great salon. It's been nicely renovated. -Yeah, son. -And what about your mobiles' booth? -My nephew is handling that. So, you got a loan for its renovation? Who's going to give loans to people like us? So, how did you get the money? How does a handicap -with one arm- get by? Well, by using the other arm - the one that's not broken. And the one who is blind in one eye? Well, by using the other eye. Son, the human body is really precious. You understand? Don't stress. Let's have some samosas. Let me get rid of this face-pack. Do that later. Let's go eat first. Uncle, this is my friend -Amar. Uncle, you got some change? One, two, three. Yay. Once more. Good girl. -Once more please. -There you go. -Hi, Roshni. -Hi, mommy. -Hi, Uncle. -How are you my child? You two came up together? Yeah, I met her downstairs. Took her for a bike ride. -Thank you, Uncle. -No problem. Carry on. -Say bye to Uncle. -Bye, Uncle. Goodbye. We'll do it again tomorrow. He's not someone who fears challenge, but someone who makes challenge fear him. He will definitely return. In due time, I will be freed of this chaos. You will never be freed of this chaos. Daddy, don't chew too fast. I'm bringing another appetizer. Sweetheart, why don't you eat as well? It's already 9:00. I'm okay. You continue. I'll eat with Amar, once he's home. Where's your brother been the whole day? -He mentioned something about some loan sanctioning. What? To get some loan sanctioned. Who's giving him this loan? Some small Credit Union. Lokesh has also gone with him. I hope he hasn't mortgaged this house or something... Don't be silly, dad. Why would he do something like that? Well, he would have had to give some collateral. He was saying it's a personal loan. -Personal? -Yeah. -Hi, brother. Why don't you freshen up? I'll serve dinner. I'll bring it to your room. I'm not hungry. Chetna, you have your dinner. People can eat whenever they want. -Are you hurt? -It's nothing. I'm fine. How did you get hurt? -Sweetheart, bring me the soup please. -Yes, dad. Just a sec. -How did you get hurt- -You go and give him his soup. You sit here and have your dinner. Let him eat whenever he wants to. Amar's got hurt on his cheek. Then you can go and be his doctor. C'mon dad. I'm not hungry. I'll eat later if I feel like it. I've got the plate already. Just have it now. C'mon, brother. All right. I'll have it later. You go to the other room. You want something else? Chetna, please have your dinner. What are you doing inside there? Listen. Listen up. Amar. Don't worry; I'm not having your food. Did I say anything to you? You never say, you just taunt. Do I interfere in anything you do? Your friends, work, life. No, nothing. Keep getting into these scuffles, and pretty soon you'll be a wanted criminal. Dad, don't be hysterical. Dad, don't walk all over me just because I've kept my mouth shut. My mouth is also shut. It's the people that are talking. This day would never have come, if you had worried about your son more than the people. -Hey, what haven't I done for you? -Please dad. That's enough. Did I not raise you well? I stayed hungry so you could become an engineer. Your sister has already turned 28. She's still roaming the streets -with her squint eye- unmarried. Do you at all care for any of this? -Keeps blabbering all day. -Please stop, dad. That is all you care about - the daughter! The daughter's wedding, her education, her eye, her dowry! Have you ever cared for the son? And you forced me to become an engineer... so your dignity could be maintained amongst your relatives. You did all this for your sake, not ours. Do you have any shame? Just drop it, dad. Go wash your hands. Who do you think are? You don't care about your sister. You talk back to your father. You've lost all shame. And you expect me to be your credit card for the rest of my life? Why didn't you come to your mother's funeral? Dad, don't you dare open up mom's chapter again. Ok, that's enough. Dad why do you bring this up when you know he feels hurt about it. Let him feel hurt. I don't care. Get out. Amar, wait. Dad, please get up. Talk to him. I don't want to stay in this house. Amar. You finished? -He left. -Let him. He'll be back. Leave his dinner plate here. He's not going to go anywhere. Bring his dinner plate. Good Morning, doctor. Good Morning. Running a little late today? Yeah, my blood pressure had shot up last night. -That's not good. -Yeah. -How're you feeling now? -Better. Yesterday, I spoke to the Photo Studio person. Visit him once you get a chance. Sure. This is the 'mother look'. Rs. 800 with an album cover. This is the 'sister look'. Rs. 500 with or without an album cover. This is the 'model look'. Make up is complementary. The 'mother look' isn't that great. Let's go for the 'family look'. Let's ask her. 'Mother look' is a bit pricey. Certainly, the 'family look' must cost lesser. No. The draping of the saree is hard work. There is no discount on that package. My daughter can wear the saree herself. Dad, this place seems expensive. Should we try somewhere else? Wait up. We'll figure. So, what should we- Sir, you'll get the desired results. But let's get the price right first. Ma'am turn to your right. No, camera right. Don't pose with that gun. Where are you looking? Move the finger to the other side. Give a friendly smile. -My daughter has a right eye squint. -Squint? Yeah, the eyes aren't aligned properly. So, can someone take a good picture of her? I'll show you. Everything's possible these days. Yes, just like an actress. One minute... -Sweetheart, take off your glasses. -Take them off? -Yeah. I spoke to them. -You sure? -Yeah, it'll be fine. -Okay. All set. Go ahead. Look to the right. Right there. Ready. 1, 2, 3...Smile. You reach easily.... - Yes, Mr. Ashok had mentioned that. This is my son -Amar. Yes, Mr. Ashok had mentioned, that the girl has an elder brother. Yes, that's him. Where do you work, son? I'm on vacation for now. Oh, okay. Son, where in Jhansi are you working? In Sonapur. -Okay. -Have something to drink. CV? Son, serve the guests. -Have something. -I avoid cold drinks. It's not that cold. Please have it. I'm okay. Thank you. Have some samosas. Son, when is your vacation finishing? I stay at home. It's been six years since I finished my engineering degree. Son, check if Chetna's ready. Bring her here, if she is. Okay, I'll bring her. -What are you doing? -Wait, it's stuck. -Okay, hurry up now. -Yeah, just a sec. -Chetna, you're looking like an angel. -Only you can think of me as an angel. -The saree's looking fine right? -It's perfect. -Will you be wearing the glasses? -Nope. -Chetna. -Come in, dad. -Let's go, sweetheart. -Let's go. What happened? -Should I wear it? -Yes, wear. -Ok. -Let's go. All the best. Will you speak in English? Our son works for an international corporation. - Okay. Hello, how are you today? Good. Good. How are you? Fine. Thank you. You're welcome. Your hobbies? My hobby is, I am nursing. That is my work and hobby. And yours. Sorry, and yours? Going to the gym. Ludo. Big Boss. Sometimes, I cook as well. Our son's almost a professional chef. Before we proceed... This is Lalit's grandma. She's been present for all the weddings in our family. Mom, over to you. Sweetheart, will you walk for us? Sweetheart, walk. Come sweetheart, walk. Get up... Wait...Raise your saree a bit. What? -It's okay. -Just a bit. Don't be shy. Come. Sit with me. Show me your palm please. Place it in my hands. Wow, such gorgeous hands. So gentle. Beautiful. Now, take off your glasses. It's a minor prescription. Just .25. That's okay. Sweetheart, take off your glasses. If the groom doesn't wear glasses, then neither should the bride. Anyway, we have laser-eye-surgery these days. -Let her keep them on. -No, please take off the glasses. Sweetheart, please take them off. Sweetheart... won't you sit? I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You're not at fault. I've failed in finding a suitable groom for you. You've done a lot for me, dad. I'll never forget that. You can't help it if I'm a squint. My beautiful daughter has been rejected by 6 boys. -I've completely let you down... -Why are you crying, daddy? If you break down, I'll fall apart. Please don't cry. This is the regulator that is used to control the dripping. Pushing the knob all the way down will stop the dripping completely. Moving it up and down will regulate... Getting into a relationship is not a sin you know. -Relationship? -Yeah. At least, try once. Don't be silly. -Ice cream. -Thank you. -Oh, thank you. -Thank you. Damodar, it'll cost me Rs. 200,000. Three years ago, it was half of this. I completely understand. But it needs to be done. You should increase your visitation fee. Your fee is way too low for today's times. If I also start earning unreasonably, how will I live with that truth? -Hi. -Hi -Lokesh. I hope you guys have made up your mind. Once our transaction is done, we don't know each other. We'll get paid partly in advance right? Of, course. So you don't back out. Rs. 10,000. Sir, that's too less. Let the surgery finish. -He's right. -No, it's too less. Rest of the payment will happen post surgery. It'll be one large sum. Don't worry. Come. Kavita... The procedure will take five days. -All details will be matched up with the donor recipient. -Make a fist. Why are you taking our blood? To match your sample with the donor recipients' samples. This has the details of the family members. Why do we need this? Because only a family member or a close friend is eligible to donate the kidney. Forget these details. Just cut us up. Take our kidneys. Give our money. And we'll leave. This surgery involves the kidney, not the appendix. Kavita, take his sample as well. -Roll up your sleeve. -Please be gentle. Relax, it's nothing. Softly.... Softly.... Her eye muscles are imbalanced. That is causing the de-alignment in the eyes. This is known as esotropia. But do not worry too much. This can be corrected by surgery. How much will this cost? Approximately.... Rs. 250,000. It's a complex surgery. We need to open up the entire eye. Simply put, it's like painting a picture on a grain of rice. Ma'am, is it necessary to perform the surgery? I'd read on the internet that eye drops can correct the problem. This certainly can't be fixed with eye drops. But meanwhile, I can show you some exercises. Close one eye. Look here. Here. Now, back here. What happened, dad? Repeat this 10 times with each eye. Back and forth. And the other exercises- What's wrong, dad? Sir, are you okay? What's wrong, dad? Let me call the nurse. Dad. Dr. Lama, we're finished with all the tests? Yes, we are. There shouldn't be a delay in the payment. You've already received the advance. You'll get the rest on time as well. You enjoyed keeping this a secret, didn't you? Now, how do I tell Amar about this? What were you waiting for? Your marriage. So am I married now? Dad, my marriage will happen when it has to. Why do you keep stressing over futile matters? Sweetheart, before I die, I want to see you married. I can't trust Amar. So, I have to take the sole responsibility. So, you're the only responsible one? Then, should I leave you in an old age home after marriage? Are you aware that your condition will soon demand a full-time guardian for you? And it's not as if the Constitution of India is forcing you to marry off your daughter. This is the constitution of Indian society, my child. Okay. So let's ask this society to pay for my eye surgery. Let's go. Let's go start asking for donations. Let's start with Roshni's mom. Get up. Why are you still sitting down? All right. Go grab a big bowl. Get the biggest one we have. I'm serious. Don't make me laugh. I'm not making you laugh. You're laughing yourself. Let's hit the streets asking for donations. And we'll use the money to fix this boom-box. You always talk like a silly goose. It's you who talks silly. I'm not going to talk to you. Even I shouldn't listen to your silly talks. Then don't. -Then don't make me listen to all that. -I'm not talking to you. I'm not talking to you either. Bro, I've come up with a great plan. There's this guy I know in Madh Island, who has a leather factory in Dubai. We get close to him, and our job will be done. Bro, you your great fucking plans... How will we go to Dubai if we have no money? Bro, we'll get the money as well. Don't worry. Relax Take it Easy. And what is this jackass doctor upto? Every other day we have to do a new test. When is he going to give us the money? Bro, it'll all get sorted out. Bro, how the fuck will it get sorted out? We got no money. We got no family. Bro, it'll be all right. There's a right time for everything. Bro, my dad must be worried sick about me. About my work, my future... That's why he's always angry with me. That's his way of showing affection. Bro, this is your problem. You always get sentimental after getting drunk. I've neither been a good son, nor a good brother. Bro, listen to me. We should first think about getting us fixed. How? Pick up. Yes, Doctor Lama? The patient has been admitted in the hospital. The surgery will take place day after. Stay away from alcohol, sugar and any excessive physical activity. Okay? I'll SMS you the timings tomorrow. Bro, finally, it's time. Let's do this. Kavita, let's speed things up please. Aye... take this off. Bro, you carry on. I can't do this. Have you gone mad? What is this nonsense? Bro, don't be stupid. Bro, I'm too shook. I can't do this. Aye, I told you- Buzz off. You can't do this. Lie down. Bro, you get your Rs. 250,000 from this. I'll get my share from somewhere else. I promise. We don't have enough time. Bro, I can't believe this. Unbelievable... You're going to bail out on me like this? If you don't want to do this- Shut up, motherfucker. I'm talking to him. Bro, I'm terrified. I can't do this. But we'll go to Dubai together. I'll take care of the money. You know I've never gone against you. I'm shook, bro. I can't help it. Get out. Get him out. -You done? Leave now. -Leave. Amar, let's go. -What's up? You guys done already? -Uncle, I couldn't do it. Where's Amar? Amar's getting it done. -And you left him alone? -Yeah. Uncle, I need Rs. 250,000 from you - anyhow. I've given Amar my word. Have you gone crazy? Where will I get that kind of money? -Uncle- -Please don't expect that from me. -Amar will be okay right? -Of course, he will be. I'll call you back. -Watch over everyone. Sir, sit there please. Where's Doctor Pawar? Who's the in-charge? -Come with me. -Quickly. Sandeep, check here. Check all the rooms. -Where's Doctor Pawar? -What? -Where's Doctor Pawar? -He's not here. -And you are? -Dr. Raj. Get out of here. Madame, leave right now. You sit down here. Who's inside there? Come out, asshole. Get out. Get out. Sandeep, take him inside. Get out. What the fuck are you doing here? Get out. Shut up and move inside. The cops are here. If you enter here, you're not going to get the money. Fuck the money. The cops are here. We'll all get busted, motherfucker. Fuck. Unhook him. Hurry up. Be careful. It's me -Sandeep. -Careful. -I am. Shut that door. Send me a backup of five personnel. -Sandeep! -Coming, sir. Where the fuck is he? -Carry him properly. -I am. Bro, you'll be good. We're almost there. -Motherfucker, carry him properly. -That's what I'm doing. I'll rip you open. Bro, we're almost there. Stop! Stop! Bro, we're almost there. Bro... Bro, open you eyes. Bro, open you eyes. Bro, we're almost there. Bro... Morey, get a hold of him. Grab him. We're almost there. A package for Mr. Jamun Prasad. Sign here, please. Thank you. -Who sent the package? -Amar Jamun Prasad. Thank you. Brother, shirt is ready. You can do it. Yes. Stay. Most symptoms are indicating Parkinson's. It's in an early stage, but it'll increase with time. He might experience tremors. As much as possible, try to keep him away from stress. The second stage will bring along rigidity and stiffness. That might cause some pain while walking. He might experience difficulties in sitting down and getting up. Please ensure a guardian is with him at all times. He also might have trouble understanding normal conversation. -So, he won't be able to run his clinic? -A sabbatical is my suggestion. I'll write down some prescription medicines which he must take daily. -Make a fist and tap on it- -Until the veins are visible. -Yes, and only then insert the syringe. -Can you see the veins? -Yes Our neighbours called me here urgently when he tried entering the wrong house. The whole area had been flooded with water. It took me 45 minutes to bring him upstairs. What can i do? What if he had slipped and got hurt? Would his body withstand an injury at this age? And on top of all this, he's a Parkinson's patient. Please make him understand. Jamun, you ought to be more careful. You must not add to Chetna's problems. -What's the need to go downstairs? -Exactly. She's treating you well, isn't she? I...wanted... to help her. Dad, you've raised me well. That's more than enough. Now, I'm able enough to take care of you and this home. I... feel.... suffocated. Mr. Jamun, listen closely. "Life is such a mystery" Which song did I just sing? Life... is a journey. Nope. Try again. "Life is such a mystery" Life.. Life.. Is.. Is a journey... Nope. ...which leads... Try again, Mr. Jamun. Life.. -Is... -Life is... -Such a mystery -Such a mystery Is this your wife? Try again, Mr. Jamun. No, sir. Just a co-worker. Now, we'll do some exercises together. Not this one. We'll do this later. Touch my finger, with yours. Try it. Go on. Try. Almost there. That's it. The tremors' intensity has increased. The reflexes have also gone weak. You go on, I'll join you. This is not a good sign, but it's inevitable. I've increased the dopamine dosage. So, I'll take your leave? Yes. Thank you for arriving at such short notice Doctor. -It's okay. -Thank you. He was very... No problem. By the way, what's your glasses' prescription? -Minus two. -Okay. Do you drink tea? Yes. Why? -Just that you didn't ask if I- -Oh I'm sorry. I apologize. -Please come in. -It's fine. I was just kidding. -Maybe next time. -All right. -Wow. It's beautiful. Congratulations. -Thank you. It's 22 carats. 22 carats? So will you be a applying to a private hospital? -Yeah. You? -Let me get married first. Amit got a job as well. We'll probably fix the date for after-six months. -Double congratulations. -Thank you. -You must come wedding shopping with me. -For sure. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? You're here? You're all set already. These suspenders... Are they Amar's? Come, I'll show you something. I'm officially a nurse now. This is the certificate. My gosh! I've never seen someone so dressed up to go to the hospital. This as well? Oh, dad. I...want to... go out. Come. Easy. Dad, one step at a time. We're going...We're going. Dad, please be careful. Dad. Dad. Help! Help! -The tea's great here. Lemon-mint. -Okay, let's try it. -How's your father? -Getting by. Without your apron... you look a little different. I'm hoping that's a good thing. Do you have any siblings? I did -an elder brother. But he passed away in an accident. -Sorry to know that. -It's okay. Has it been long? Thank you. It's been about a year, since he passed away. You must take special care of your father. Parkinson's is almost incurable. I know. Your family stays in the city? Umm, my mom stays with me. Dad's settled in Dubai. Oh, wow! Actually, he re-married. It's been a while now. So, your parents are separated? -Please don't mind. I was just- -Not at all. It's fine. I'm guessing a lot of families must be coming to see you; to ask for your hand. That drill has been repeating itself for the past few years now. But that's all they do. They see. Then they leave. And that's it. Why's that? Because of this? Can I tell you something? You're much likelier to get married if you stop wearing these glasses. It's okay. Everything you'll need is here. Garbage is collected at nine in the morn All the grocery items are up at the top. The job is for five days. I'm going out of town. My father and all the housework needs to be taken care of. -Do we sleep here? -Here, or in the bedroom. Your wish. The washroom is down the hall. -Is he able to walk on his own. -Yes. Why? Can he use the washroom on his own or do we need to drag him? Why are you talking like that? So, that's him. He needs to be looked after. His three meals a day; his errands. That's about it. -Rs. 1000 a day? -How about 500? Okay, that's fine. Is there Wi-fi here? Yes, there's Wi-fi. Give me your phone. I'll put in the password. Oh dad, I'll be back in five days, once the trial period ends. It's a private hospital, so the salary's good. And I'll be working here full-time. So, it's not like I'm leaving the city forever. You don't want me to go? Can I... come with you? You can't come with me, daddy. You know that. I'm going to miss you. Deenu will look after you. Don't you worry. -Phone...me... -Of course I'll call you, dad. Where did we stop at last time? The dark clouds conquered the once shimmering moon Giving life to the resting demons of the jungle And capturing the travellers of the night I'll see you in few days, dad. The demons demanded blood of the travellers Bye, daddy. The dark clouds conquered the once shimmering moon Ready to go? 3321. The travellers cried back to the tyrannical clouds We want light. Hello Uncle. When are we going for the bike ride? Off..Off... What? Okay, I'll turn it off. Don't get so worked up. Go... You want me to go? Who'll do the cleaning if I leave? (mumbles) Go... I won't go. Miss Chetna has given me this job. (mumbles) Go to your room. I won't put up with this the whole day. If you're allergic to pop music, go listen to sermons. This is Alok. Age-37. He's an officer in the Forest Department. Look at him -Murli. He's not concerned with the squint. He's currently unemployed. He's a writer in the film industry. Forget about it. The third option is not worth it. But it's about time that your daughter starts making her home. All good? Ok, we'll do the next exercise. Lift the clip, and place it like this. Let's go. That's it. Now, just clip it there. Keep trying. Very good, Mr. Jamun. Let's go for another one. (Indistinct mumbles) Oh my god! What have you done? Uncle, that's enough. Don't bathe again. Go in the bathroom Look at the mess you've made. You'll get me wet as well. Go in. Now, bathe in there. Don't make me call up your daughter. Stay inside, and bathe. God, give me a break. What a pain this guy is- Holy- Go in. What's your problem, oldie? Bathe inside the bathroom. This guy and his antics... Are you all right? Yeah Chetna. How's dad? The house lights were off; he got a little fright. He's fine now. I've given him dopamine as well. Thank you so much, Kewal. If this continues, how will I work? It wasn't his fault. Deenu left the house with the lights off. He scared. This is normal for a Parkinson's patient. Don't you worry. I'll take care of him. -Is he okay now? -Yes. He's fine. Don't worry. Lord Rama is the truth. Lord Rama is the truth. (funeral chanting) (indistinct mumbles) Lord Rama is the truth. Lord Rama is the truth. Do you like Chetna? Amar has left. Your daughter needs to make her home.
