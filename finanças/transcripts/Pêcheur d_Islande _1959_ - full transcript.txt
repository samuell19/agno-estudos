LOST AT SEA ON HIS FIRST TOUR THIS LAST JULY 1899 ICELAND FISHERMAN Yan! Yan, it's not good! Come here! -So? -So he's not well. Let's give him a shot. Look in the medicine cabinet. Take the helm! Hello Conquet. Iceland Fisherman speaking. Put me through to Mével Shipping in Concarneau. Mével Shipping in Concarneau. Over. Radio Conquet, understood. Hello Iceland Fisherman. Iceland Fisherman. You're through to Mével Shipping, over. Hello Mr Mével, Yan speaking. Quémeneur broke his leg. I'll disembark him in Brest and carry on fishing. Over. Berger speaking. Where are you? Answer. I'm ten miles Northeast of Shamrock. Over. I consider that the Iceland Fisherman no longer has a captain. As a result, go back to Concarneau and disembark the injured. We'll then see with Mével what we're going to do. Over. It's silly to stop a fishing campaign for an injured man I can disembark! Put me through to Mével. I want to talk to him. Over. I'm in charge. Mével isn't here. He went to Paris to pick up his daughter. He'll be here tonight. Over. So, no regrets as you leave Paris? No, dad. I don't regret anybody, if that's what you want to know. Ah, so… Berger stands a chance. Yes, he's a fine man. Let's tune on the marine waves to listen to the news of the ships. There you go. Mével would better look after his ships! If his little girl still needs help to cross the street… I keep on fishing. Over. No, Yan. I'm ordering you to come back to Concarneau. Over. Iceland Fisherman en route for Concarneau. Arrival tonight around midnight. Over. This bloody old tub! Always the same one. It already cost 15 millions two years ago when they were caught in Irish territorial waters. Who's that Yan talking so highly of me? A very fine guy. Oh, I see. One of your old sea dogs. Not at all. He's the first mate. I'd like to make him captain. But what a temper! Stubborn as a… -As a Breton, like you, dad. -Hey! Back up! Back up! The stretcher! Pass it through here! -Quick, give it to me! -Here. Careful on the way down! So, old guy? Don't worry, you're home now. All together. Let's take him down to the wharf. Shall we go? Stand there. Easy does it! Hold him from underneath. -Listen! What happened? -Mind your own business. Ah, it's you. A trawl panel fell on his leg. A trawl panel? Blimey! It's no mean feat! Let's go. Very clever! Well done, you! You made me miss the tide. It's not for the money, but for the principle. Why stop a fishing campaign? Were you afraid I would lose the ship? -I don't like useless risks. -There was no risk. I have my captain's license! You'd hate to see me in charge. If this boat is a rotten tub, it's not his fault. It's because of you and you stupid orders. "Go back to Concarneau", is that all you could think off? You're making me laugh. -I can't say the same about you. -Your orders are like you. Hey, hey! You're going too far, Yan. You're too loud. Pipe down now. -I didn't see you, Mr Mével. -I saw you, and I heard you mainly. What I'm told to do is stupid. If you had been here… -I would have given you the same order. -You? Never! I said stop it. That's enough for today. -Well, no… -Is that it? If it's not finished, it's going to start! Thanks for putting him in his place. You didn't get it, man. The kid was right. I'm drowning! Careful, he'll get hit by the propeller! Save me! He'll get hit by the propeller! Save me! Save me! My children! Save me! I'm going to drown! You're lucky that I don't argue with women… So, Yan, you… -Yeah, tomorrow. -No, today. -Are you OK? -Yeah, I'm OK. As you can see. I see. You swallowed water, now you can swallow something else! I swallowed the whole Atlantic Ocean! Only a good pastis can remove that taste. One pastis! -Here you go, frogman. -Thank you, pretty lady. This is the Mediterranean! Come on, get warm. Are you daydreaming? No, I'm thinking of Quémeneur. It will take him six months to recover. And to think that some people go out in such a weather! Us in Marseilles, when we see white horses around the Château d'If, we stay home! Whereas they go out on purpose. Yes, that's why they don't come home. I have been visiting churches, and I saw "Legal, "lost at sea", Whatsisname "lost at sea". "Lost at sea", "lost at sea"… Everywhere, "lost at sea"! All over the walls! Such a fun chap! Oh, there's much more fun over there! Me, at the end of my career, I'd like to be transferred there. Because I don't want to stay here. No. I'd rather start over the whole war! Specially since you didn't go to war! What do you mean? I was mobilised in Nice! You'll tell him later. Go get changed, or you'll catch a cold. Me? I can't be in worst shape than the ship. Tomorrow, I'm taking it to the dockyard. Right, I'm going to get some shut-eye. Good night. Good night. Miss, another pastis for the castaway. -Oh! -Need anything, Sir? Yes, Captain! -You weren't supposed to be back so soon. -No, it's fate. Fate is nice. You only think of me when you see me. I'll never be able to change you, so I love you as you are. -When are you leaving? -It depends on Mével and Berger. -Will you come before you leave? -Maybe, if I can. I have a few bottles in store for you. When you drink them at sea, you'll have to think about me. You're prickly. Mével's daughter is back. She was a kid three years ago. Now she's a woman. A very pretty woman. Here eyes are like this… blue as the sky. Is that it? Don't get near her anyway. -She's not a girl for you. -I don't have delusions of grandeur. I'm watching, you know. Too bad for you, I don't like competition. You shouldn't have made me love you. -I had prepared some sentences but… -No need, I know what you're going to say. Ah? I wasn't expecting that. You made a mistake in you probability calculations. Gaud, I think I can make you a happy woman. Let me get used to this idea slowly. I've been used to it for several years. Careful, they say that habit kills love. Ah, Yan! The boss want to see you. Go to the office immediately. Hey, calm down. What am I doing here? I'm working for him! Mr Berger, since you're here, I'll show you the engine. Will it take long? Well… just a short time. I know engineers' "short times". OK, let's go. Excuse me, Gaud. I'm going home then. Do you need a ride? I don't want to bother you. Come then. Well… thank you. And, about last night… Excuse me, I didn't say good bye. Don't hold it against me, I was very angry. When you really want something, you have to defend it. I like what I do so much that sometimes, I'm going too far. -I thought you were very good. -I don't think your father agrees. -I'm in for an earful! -Wait! I'm coming with you. He won't be as harsh. MÉVEL SHIPPING COMPANY OFFICES ON THE GROUND FLOOR SECRETARY Hurry up, the boss is waiting. Ah. Sit down. You're bothering us, my girl. Leave us. Ah. You and me, now. There's something wrong. There's a boat that's going badly, there's a boat that's rotten, there's a boat that pisses me off, and it's yours! Mayhem and indiscipline, rule onboard. I didn't like at all your little scene last night. Now you're discussing the orders of the shipping company? If the crew isn't happy, they may go! The door is wide open. OK. Now that you know what I think… Let's move on to something else. Here's a new crew. I made you captain. What? Yes. Only master of the ship after God. It's a very nice present I'm making you. The boat has a bad reputation. Some say it's cursed, they call it "the hearse", but that's rubbish that none of us believes in. Your boat is what you make of it! When I started at your age, I was sailing on an old rickety cod fishing boat that had bad luck because it hadn't been christened. I took this old tub through a mighty storm. And we got through. Oh, it was a real fight! It was the good old days. Needless to say that after that, nobody talked of bad luck… Forgotten! It's the same problem with Iceland Fisherman. You have to find something. Anything, I don't know! Cope with it. You're the youngest captain in Concarneau. By the way, do you remember Kermadec? Yes… He was a captain of the Fisherman. Yes. Do you know what happened to him? He's an ordinary seaman in Lorient. And nobody wants him. Do you know why? Well… This numbskull went fishing in Irish national waters. Of course, he got caught. I paid the bill. And it was steep. Plus the cargo, the fishing equipment, the crew locked up for a month… Ask Cloarec, he was there. So I don't want trouble. Don't venture in those areas. Or you'll join Kermadec in Lorient. -Understood? -Of course! Good. What if I gave you Gaud? Gaud? Yes, my last child. What do you think of that? Oh that is nice! It will be one of the longest boats in Concarneau, 29,50 metres. Prove me that I was right about you and I promise I'll give you Gaud. The boat, not my daughter. Yes? Yes. I'll take him. What are you waiting for? You've got work to do, haven't you? Yes? Did it go well? -I thought so. -Your father is such a nice guy. Yesterday, he was telling me off. This morning, he made me captain. -I'm so happy! -I can tell. People will talk about the Iceland Fisherman, I promise. And not as an old tug! It will be the best boat in Concarneau. It will bring back a lot of fish! Crews will fight to embark on my boat. People make me laugh, talking of destiny. You have to force destiny! It's nice to see a happy man. In Paris, nobody's happy. Of course in Paris, they probably don't have time… Gaud! We're all going for lunch at Moulin de Rosmadec, are you coming? Good bye, Miss. I'm going to the boat, we're leaving tonight. -Shall I take you? -No, thanks, not today. -Why? -I have an appointment. Somebody you like more than me? Someone I love very much and who loves me very much. Ah. I don't want to be indiscreet. Have a good day. Tell me, Marcel. Why do you give up so easily? I beg your pardon? You don't like to force destiny. Yan! I'd like to come on this expedition. All right, vicar. We might as well have God with us although we won't waste time praying him. Yet with a hearse… It's no longer a hearse! With a new captain and a priest onboard, we're in luck! Nonsense! We already had this priest on the Melpomène. We didn't catch more fish. Less, even! When you were five, you told me, "Crepes look like the angels' haloes." You were a nice little girl, shy and quiet. Now you put on lipstick! I did too, when I was your age. On Sundays, to go dancing. But at least, I was putting it badly! Why did your idiotic father send you to Paris? To study law. Law? Law? What is it used for? Well… it's used for… Nothing! Nothing. And studying is tiring. You don't look well. I'll have to take care of you. -You'll come back home. -Never! I don't want to see this old fool! -Why? -He has a bad temper. -Hello, grandma. -Hello. So you didn't embark on your blasted boat? Yan told me to get off and study for my fishing licence. Four months at school. He gave me his books. I'll have some spare time. Yan sorted it out with Letendre. You know, the one who has a small boat. I'll go with him. -I'll make some money. -Sounds good. The Iceland Fisherman is a lost boat. With Yan, it will change. I don't think so. There are forces men can't do anything against. Eh, Captain! May I call you Captain? It's all set onboard. You can spend one hour with Jenny. One hour or two, it's up to you. It's not because you're a captain that you should lose your habits. No, I don't have time today. And… we're running late. Actually, you're right. I think I'll go… You changed your mind! Now we aren't late! Oh yeah… I understand now. I'm the one who was late. Hello, Miss Jenny. I'll put it in Yan's cabin, he's captain now. Whatever! It's for the whole crew. Tell Yan I saw his little game. I can't wait now, we'll discuss it when the boat returns. In three weeks, you won't remember! Storms only last two or three days. In three weeks at this time, we'll round the Glenan Islands. -I wish you succeed. -I will. I've been told… So many things threaten the boat. The sea, the wind, the night… And also… You believe all the nonsense they say about this boat. Yes, you're right. At the university in Paris, it would make my friends laugh. But tonight… In front of the sea… I'm worried. Oh, you know, the sea… It's not that bad. That's the boat's siren. I only have ten minutes left. Yan. If I came back earlier, it was to wish you… Do you understand? I wanted to tell you that… Don't say anything. The panel! Downstream! It's pathetic, there isn't even one crate in there! Ten days and not even 25 crates of fish. And a torn net, on top of it! -It's the vicar's fault. -Leave him alone, he's puking in the hold. You can go! There, easy. Did you see, Yan? That's it! It's pathetic. Pathetic! We can't do better with this crap boat! Radio Conquet, calling Iceland Fisherman. Iceland Fisherman fishing. Over. Melpomène from Radio Conquet. Over. Conquet. Melpomène. …for Tuesday's sale, 350 crates. Hey, Cloarec! Cloarec! Come here! -Trawling over! -Yes, I'm coming! Tie up the panel. Put the net on the rail. That's it for today. -Are we going again? You're not well? -No, that's enough. Take the helm. Hide the registration! To port. Course East-Northeast. …from Radio Conquet, thanks. Have a good day. Over and out. You shouldn't do that. Are you hearing me? Leave me alone and hold the helm. You shouldn't. I was with Kermadec, I know what it is. We all spent a month in jail in Ireland. And we didn't get a penny! Leave me alone! I know what I'm doing. No, you don't know. This boat is rotten, we won't get through. If we race with the Irish Navy, we'll end up in jail. So? To the left! You don't feel like laughing, it sounds fake. Léon, two side-cars. Mr Berger. They're waiting for you. I didn't know you had an ear for music. Where are you, Gaud? You're here and very far away. I wonder where and with whom. -Does it worry you that much? -Of course. I won't be relaxed until we get engaged. -Eight days of miraculous catch of fish! -Eight days that I'm scared. In territorial waters, we'll live to regret it! Maybe not. Look at this, see if I'm not wrong. Shit! With our trawl in the water, we can't get away quickly. I told you, Yan! Serves you right! And us, too, unfortunately. You, at the back! Move this mess! Haul the trawl fast! Come on, haul the trawl, hurry! Faster than that! All this fish getting away… We should get away. -We already have 550 crates… -We cut it all! -Let's split! -Go to the back! Cut the net, quick! Chief, it depends on you. Push the engine to the max! Don't worry, Yan, it will be OK! Cloarec, come here! Quick! -No news from Iceland Fisherman? -No. No news, it's been two days. I'm getting worried. Is the weather bad over there? Not really but you never know what might happen. Engine breakdown, the boat drifting in currents… And there are lots of rocks over there. I'm wondering if I should raise the alarm. We can wait till tonight. -Hello, Gaud. -Hello, Marcel. -Why wait? -To be sure. Always that damned boat… I'll end up thinking it's cursed. -Bruna? -Yes, Sir? Call Radio Conquet. Ask our boats if they know where Iceland Fisherman is. Yes? Iceland Fisherman calling. It's him. I put it on the speaker. A message for Mével Shipping, from Iceland Fisherman. "Heading to Concarneau. "Will be back Tuesday night, 550 crates, over and out." Well done. The insurance company would not have been happy. You're too sensitive, Berger. It will be your ruin. I understand now. -Understand what? -Everything you've done. It was for her. You wanted to impress her and bring back more fish than the others. Whatever the cost. It was for her, wasn't it? -Say it! -Mind your own business. It is my business. It's everybody's business! You're taking risks and having fun. You're paid with smiles and the rest… Will you shut up or I make up shut up! No, I won't shut up! Without that miraculous fog, we would have ended up in Shannon, in jail! Ah, love, it makes you go crazy! Idiot! I'll tell you two things. First, the Irish boat couldn't catch up with us. -Even without the fog. -I'm curious to know why. You're too dumb for me to explain. Second, I don't care about this girl. Get this through your skull. If you have something to add, go ahead, I'm listening. Go prepare the docking. Ah… Nice couple. I was trying to make you smile. As much as I dislike the guy, I'm impressed by the result. Your father was right. Why are you mentioning this guy? I don't care about him! And he smells of fish. -Jenny, can you hear me? -Yes. Why did you come and meet me on the wharf? As usual! Nothing more. You threw your arms around me as if you hadn't seen me for ten years! -I'm not keen on that style. -My style? What's the problem with my style? You liked it, not so long ago. His Highness wants to change styles. You're into the ship-owner's daughter style now? Answer me! I don't like the silent style. You're getting on my nerves. My style is to be left alone. So you should be happy instead of shouting at me. They say we had never seen so many soles. Too many even. Too many? What do you mean? I know what I'm talking about. Don't forget my brother was a fishmonger. I know where these soles come from. They speak English. And they have an Irish passport. What are you saying? You're crazy. It's the truth! Say to my face that I'm wrong. I won't have you questioning me, for a start. Swear that you didn't go there. I don't need to swear on that kind of rubbish. People say that when they don't want to tell the truth. You can tell me. I'm silent as the grave. It goes with your hearse, doesn't it? Where are you going, dressed up to the nines? To the ball! The Mével Shipping ball! -Are you invited? -Yes, by you. -Really? -If you're ashamed of me, say it. I don't have to justify myself. -Are you taking me then? -Well yes. Unless you want to dance with another girl. Of another style… In three months, I'll get my licence and we'll get married. Yes, let's not waste time. -You don't mind being a sailor's wife? -No, I'll do like the others. Hello. -Here you are! Still angry at me? -Of course. -Do you know why? -Do you think I remember? -But I know you were wrong. -All right, I'm really sorry. Come have a drink and a biscuit. You're lucky I'm in a good mood. Of course… Here, to us! What's wrong, Gaud? You seem as distant as when you were in Paris. Silly you! I like you. Exactly what I was saying. Do you want her picture? If you talk to her, I'll leave. You shouldn't say that, you know. You don't know me, Yan. I'm capable of anything. This stuck-up girl wants to rub against you. Stop it, that's enough. -They have a knack in Paris. -Will you shut up? Who do you think you are? Just the captain of a rotten boat. -Why, thank you! -And you want the ship-owner's girl! Look at you! You're not for her, only for me. You see, I didn't want to hurt you earlier. After the nasty things you just said, I won't think twice. You can't do that to me, Yan! Don't leave me! Come in. Good morning, Sir. Good morning. I asked you to come because something has been worrying me. Did you go fishing in Irish territorial waters? Is it true? Yes. Yes, it's true. That's… So I was wasting my breath with everything I told you? Do you know what it's called? Breach of trust. Do you know what I'm risking? 15 millions to pay to the Irish treasury. No, they didn't catch me! But they must have seen your number! Impossible, I hid everything. So to top it all, it was premeditated! You behaved with me like a little bastard! Fire me if you want, but don't insult me! Did your promotion get to your head? Are you counting on proving yourself in balls like last night? You know it's not true. How long did you stay there? Well… eight days. Enough time to get busted by the Navy. One of their ships went after me but never caught up with me. I had my reasons! Please, don't insist! You're fired. All I can do is letting you reembark as an ordinary sailor. Under Cloarec? I'd rather be dead. Then… What went into you? What were you thinking about? Why? Actually, I don't give a damn. Get out of here. Mind you, as a civil servant, I think you're wrong. But as a man, maybe you had good reasons. Hey my lovely, give me another pastis. If I had been on duty in French territorial waters and I had seen an Irish trawler acting as a buccaneer, then I would give him what for! Unless the sea is too rough of course! I'd like to know what son of a bitch turned my in! Don't think about it, Yan. Well… "Don't think about it"… I'm thinking of the trawler that I lost. My boat. I won't have been captain for long. Yet I succeeded. Yet I succeeded. But that… I couldn't explain it to Mével. It didn't come out. I wasn't wrong though. Give me another one! No, you drank too much. What? I'm paying, yes or no? Huh? I can drink, now that I'm nothing. That I'm just a wreck. Huh? Give me another one! Yan, I heard. I'm as sad as you are. Who told you I was sad? I'm starting from zero. I can start over, I don't need anybody. Come. Gaud is outside, she's waiting for you. Do you hear me? Come! Tell her that it's fucked up now. Fucked up, like me. We're aren't the strongest. Oh… Tell her I don't want her pity. Eh, Captain! Are we going aboard? The wind is picking up, there's a squall. 6I only have two days a week to go to sea. I have to get out. And I'm broke. Marie and I, we'd like to go dancing. It's brightening up! Hop on then, my boy! Ah, here's Yan. Irish Yan. I've been offering to take you onboard for a month. I'm glad to have you. This boat or another one, it's all the same to me. I don't want to go on the one next door. You're wrong. This hearse will last longer than any of us. We're casting off. I heard you were marrying Berger, your father's partner? Yes. I had other hopes, but it's impossible, so… You're right. Don't wait too long. You're old. I was sixteen when I got married. Oh… It sounds like a bell. It's a church bell. The church of the city of Ys. One Sunday, a very long time ago, the priest was saying mass. The sea was so rough that it broke all the port dykes and submerged the city that disappeared into the waves. When the weather is bad and a ship is in distress, the bells ring at full peal. -He's dead. -Yes, he's dead. Stay here, I'll go get the police. Wait, I'm coming with you. Listen, Yan, they're asking you on the radio. What? What do they want? It's the Mével daughter. She says it's urgent. I can't! Basking shark on starboard! -Yan! -Yes? She's saying that Sylvestre, you know… Little Sylvestre! Last night, he died. SYLVESTRE MOAN LOST AT SEA ON FEBRUARY 17, 1959 AT THE AGE OF 18 You came to see him, thank you. Hello, Bourdic. Hello, Mr Mével. How are you? Good. Bourdic, I have a proposition for you. I trust you, you're a good seaman, I'm giving you a boat. -Which one, Mr Mével? -Iceland Fisherman. I've been sailing for 40 years, I know the deal. Nobody wants it. I know, everybody knows. Excuse me, Mr Mével, I don't want it. Thanks. Good bye. He's the third one! They have no guts! -In my days… -Serves you right. You only get what you deserve. You had a good captain who was running your boat well, you can't deny it, and you threw him out. I'm a ship-owner, not a smuggler. Yeah. You're like the others, you didn't get it. The boy was right. -Do you know why he did it? -No, and I'd like to know. I'll tell you. Do you remember what you did with your damn sailing ship when you were 20? You drove it into a terrible storm. He did the same. He challenged his boat and he won! After that, these stories of rotten boats… They were forgotten! Don't forget that this boat was an old tug. -I'm sorry but… -You said so yourself! The best sailors wanted to leave it. When Yan sailed back, you had the best crew in Concarneau. Now you don't have it. You lost it. That's very clever, Mével! Say, say! Hey! You may be right. -I'll take him back. -Ah! You want to take him back like that, like you hire a secretary? The guy has his pride, no? -No, it's over, it's blown. -Then he can go to hell! -With his Breton stubbornness. -Don't say that, you like him. I like him too. I got him his fishing licence. So I'll do you a favour for him, not for you. You're getting on my nerves! Instead of talking, go get him back for me. I wanted to show it to you in ten days, but I'm so happy. Oh, how pretty! I was sure you'd like it. You see, I can decide too. Thanks. Hey lovebirds, come with us. You have all your life to be together. Sorry, we're having dinner in Concarneau. Léon, a scotch. This little Gaud is very quiet. She only goes out with here fiancé. She doesn't seem to like it, by the look on her face! Léon, a scotch. -We're casting off! -Yes. Mayday, mayday, mayday.

Yan, do you hear me? It's me, Gaud. I'm confident, you'll be rescued. I'm sure! You will come back! Life can't do that to us, Yan. You'll come back. I'll wait for you alone on the pier in Concarneau. Marie-Jeanne speaking. We're eight miles away… Cloarec. It's over. No more radio. Yan? Answer me, please! Hello! Iceland Fisherman, hello? Hello! Iceland Fisherman doesn't answer. Over. No, no! No, it's not possible! It will be another 45 minutes at least. 24F4 here, 24F4 here. There's a lull. I'm hoping to find the Iceland Fisherman. I'll call back after airdropping. Over. 24F4 here, impossible to airdrop. I have problems on the right engine. Returning to base. Over. Conquet, understood. Six o'clock. It must be over. This the Marie-Jeanne. I saw a cargo ship that I couldn't contact. No more Iceland Fisherman. It's over. Many debris are floating on the surface. I retrieved a lifebelt. Over and out. Don't be like that, my girl. Go away! I hate you! It's your fault, you let this rotten ship go to sea! He's dead now! He's dead and he was the one I loved! Yes? Radio Conquet speaking, a Panama freighter disembarked in Tangiers survivors from the Iceland Fisherman. What? …disembarked in Tangiers survivors from the Iceland Fisherman. I don't have the names. I'll call you back in two minutes. OK, thanks. Did you hear that, children? A Panama freighter is disembarking survivors from the Iceland Fisherman! He's calling back in two minutes. It's not possible! It happened two days ago. These things can happen. They're probably weapon smugglers sailing off the French coasts. They don't want to give their position to avoid being discovered. Gaud, I… Hello? Radio Conquet here. Tangiers just called back. The whole crew of the Iceland Fisherman is safe. I repeat: Tangiers just called back. The whole crew is safe. Hello? Do you hear me? Hello? Hello, do you hear me? Hello? Well, I'll give him Gaud then. THE END Subtitle translation by: Valerie Le Guen
