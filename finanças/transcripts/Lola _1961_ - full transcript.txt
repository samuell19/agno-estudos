"Cry who can, laugh who will." - Chinese Proverb Damn it, I'm late. You're late. It's past 2:00. - What of it? - As nice as ever! I fell asleep after lunch. I'm grouchy. You'll be fired again and never find a new job. Give me some coffee, not too hot. I'm always late. My freedom's too important to me. And I hate busybodies. Where's Jeanne? - Downtown. This town and its people bore me. Thanks a lot. I don't mean you. And I like people, but sometimes I get sick of it all. - All what? - Everything - especially me. Sugar. - Sorry. I'm hopeless. So dramatic! Then do something. Do I let things get me down? No! Neither do I. I think! Less thinking and more action. Watch what you're doing! 2:10. Now you've done it. It's a stupid job. No great loss. A chair, quick! I'm going to pass out! Claire, it's awful! - What? What a shock! I just saw him! - Who? - Michel! My son! Give me a cognac. I was shopping, and I saw him go by in a car. I had a feeling. I told my sister so this morning. Roland, you believe in dreams, don't you? I do, and I saw him last night. In my dream I spilled some rice. That means a visit. There was rice all over! I was swimming in it! When Michel left seven years ago, he said... "Mother, I'm going to be a father any minute now. I'm off to seek my fortune" - and off he went. And for seven years now, not a word. Last night I had a dream, and as I left the hardware store just now, who goes by? Michel, in a gorgeous car right out of a dream. I come in here, almost apoplectic, and you act like I'm crazy. - Jeanne". - Crazy! If Michel were here in Nantes, you'd be the first to know. And he left here broke. How could he have a car like that? - He made his fortune. - Michel's an honest man. - Then I'm crazy. - You're telling me! - Claire's right. - Go on, insult me. No, but a son would come to see his mother first. - You never met him. - He's kind. Sure - honest, kind, and perfect! Make him out to be a saint! But you don't abandon your mother and baby. - What baby? - His own. - Then he left his wife too. - He left some poor girl probably scrubbing floors, slaving away to raise his child - Where's my box? Where it always is. - Aren't you going to work? - Yes, I am. One day I'll go away too. - You still here? - What's your problem? You're lazy. I don't like lazy people. If you meant to hurt my feelings, you have. Good-bye, Jeanne. Good-bye, Roland. - You're very mean. - I tell it like it is. - The boss asked for you twice. - What for? No idea. Hold on. Yes, sir. He just came in. I will, sir. He's waiting for you. No, impossible. Sit down, Cassard. I'll call you back. Now, then. Cassard, this can't go on like this. My father always used to say... "Punctuality is the mark of kings," to which he'd add... "If you wish to succeed in life, be punctual." You'll say you're no king and succeeding means little to you. Right? - More or less. You're no doubt intelligent - No, don't deny it. I've been observing you. But you have a major fault. You're off in the clouds. I do dream a bit. That's not good. Look things square in the face. You've been here three days on a trial basis, and you've been late five times. I don't want excuses. I'm sure you have plenty. "My alarm didn't go off." "I missed my bus." I do have, sir. Let's hear it. I was set on finishing this fascinating novel - Let me see. It's a great novel. It was my bedtime reading for years. Then you understand. There's a line on page 55: "There's no dignity nor real life for a man who works 12 hours a day without knowing what he's working for." It's true. I don't know what I'm working for. Very well. Come back when you've figured it out. Good-bye, my boy. Well? Nothing. We didn't see eye to eye. RETURN TO PARADISE How are you? Daisy, that's enough rehearsing today. Music! Champagne! Let's have some fun! Sure Lola's here. Over there. Nice of you to come back. I was just leaving. I want to sleep with you again. I don't. Just because. I brought this for you. Whiskey and cigarettes! That's crazy! And that's for your son. You shouldn't have. Thanks, Frankie. You don't like me. I do. That's just it. I don't understand. It's just how it is. Please. - Hello. - Hi, Mommy. Frankie brought this for you. Hello, Madame Desnoyers, Miss C?cile. How are you? - Quite upset. Here are your books. Some practical joker underlined the killer's name on page 13. It's outrageous. See for yourself. I'm very sorry, madame. And the other book is scandalous. I'd have been mortified if C?cile had read it. I don't understand. It's so beautifully written. You usually appreciate a nice style. And good morals? What do you say about that? And that Justine girl - she's so stupid. I didn't think you'd be shocked. It's very much in demand. Hello, Mr. Cassard. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to suggest today. My daughter needs a book. She has one hour of English a week this year. Fridays from 4:00 to 5:00. She'd like a dictionary with both French and English. But a little one. Be quiet. A little dictionary. That's a rather specialized item. - Not really. - Pardon? It's very useful for learning English. True, but I'll have to special-order it. - They never have what we want. - C?cile! It's true. Anyway, I don't care. Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhearing. I have a dictionary I'm not using. If you wish - You're too kind, but we couldn't possibly accept. Mr. Cassard's one of my best customers. Roland Cassard. I wouldn't want to impose. Very well. I accept your offer. Say thank you. You look like a childhood friend of mine named C?cile. I lost track of her after the war. Your name made me suddenly think of her. You look so like her that it feels like 10 years ago - no, 15! That can be unsettling. It certainly can. It'd be a pleasure to help. When may I bring it by? Don't go out of your way. My daughter and I - I have plenty of time. We live at 10 rue du Calvaire. Madame Desnoyers. Perhaps this evening at 7:00? - Gladly. Then thank you again, and good-bye. Corning, C?cile? - Mother, Sacha Distel. - Not today. They're charming. I look awful. You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known. Really? You have charm, grace, and beauty. And you're in love. I'm always in love! I have a fianc?e in the States, you know. - What did you do before? - Before what? Before the navy. I worked for my father in Chicago, Illinois. What's he do? He's in lifts. You know - for going up. Airplanes? Sputniks? - No, not Sputniks. Well, never mind. I might work for him again when I get home in three months. And get married? You look so much like him. - Who? A guy. A guy I loved a lot. American? No, French. You're not jealous? No, I'm not jealous. Tomorrow we leave for Cherbourg. Our leave's over. And then? Back to the States. Will you ever come back to France? Maybe. I don't know. Come on. I have so much to do. I have to take my son to school, and I'm late. Why are you looking at me like that? No reason. Just to look at you. I'll come say good-bye tomorrow. If you like. - What's wrong? - It's broken. - I'll buy you a new one. - I want a trumpet. Okay, you'll have one. Let's go. Come on. The dictionary. It was here this morning. What did I do With it? Here it is. Funny. - I'm out of a job. - Surprised? No, but I'm broke. Could you loan me some money? Here. I'm a soft touch. Give me a galette. - With butter? - Of course. I didn't see you over there. That's pretty. It's a seascape. - Is your son back? - No, it wasn't him. I'd have bet my right arm it was. Lucky you didn't. Can't paint seascapes without it. - Silly man. - I've made an important decision. I'm leaving. I saw a Gary Cooper movie this afternoon. It was a beautiful place. The people seemed happy. - Where? - At the Katorza. I meant what country. Matareva, a Pacific island near Tahiti. It's always beautiful in the movies. It's always beautiful in the movies. - So is life. Why not? We don't know how to live here anymore. Me with my boss, you with your drunks. You know how to live? - I figure I'll learn. - By traveling? To each his own, but for me, it's the only cure. - For what? - Boredom. You should get married. And have lots of kids. With six kids to feed, you'd have no time to be bored. You'll never understand me. We're too stupid. What's this? A dictionary. Jeanne knows how to live. She kills time with her splotches of paint. Splotches of paint? Sorry. Your works of art. You kill time with your works of art. But I have no works to create. I'm lost. Totally lost. And bored shitless. Sorry. Create some music. - What about Th?r?se? - Finished, like music. Make new friends. I had a buddy, but he got bumped off. So everything's peachy. You really want to leave? - You know of a way? Maybe. Favigny from the shoe shop was looking for someone. - Me, sell shoes? - Let me finish. It's probably too late anyway. Something about a hairdresser. I didn't really follow. You remember, Jeanne? I don't just pretend to listen. - It's for real? - I think so. Ask for Mr. Valentin at the hair salon in the arcade and say Mr. Favigny sent you. You know Mr. Favigny? Maybe, but cutting hair or selling shoes - This boy! Just go and find out. Watch where you're going! - Sorry. Did I hurt you? - No, but - Roland! Pardon? Don't you recognize me? C?cile! This is crazy! Of all things! - Did I hurt you? - No. I thought of you just this morning. - And I mentioned you earlier. I met a young girl who looks like you - except you've changed. What a surprise! Look, I'm trembling! I really am. It's like a chill up my spine. I'm so happy! Oh, I got lipstick on you. It's been ten years at least. - Longer. Since the war. We may have briefly crossed paths once. I didn't recognize you. - You haven't changed. - Really? - Barely. Where are you headed? I'm going - - That way. Yvon, come here. My son. Say hello. - You're married? - No. Well, almost. I'm so happy to see you. Feel how my heart's pounding. And you? - What? - You married? - No. It's odd we've never run into each other. I left town years ago. I travel a lot. I'm a dancer. I work all over. I just got here three days ago. What time is it? - 6:15. I have to run. Yvon! Look at your hands. Can't you keep still? I didn't even have time to dress. I'm in my leotard. I've got a run! We must get together. - Anytime. I'm in a hurry. I must get him to school. Are you free tonight? - Yes. - At 8:00 in front of the theater. - All right. I'm so thrilled! Did I get lipstick on you? Oops! See you tonight. Yes? - Mr. Valentin? - He's not in. Mr. Favigny sent me. I'll go see. Who may I say...? It's personal. - Mr. Favigny sent me about the job. - What job? He said you were looking for someone. That's right. - What's it involve? - It's a delicate matter. Please don't ask questions. Are you available? I wouldn't be here otherwise. Come with me. It involves a trip. Or several trips, depending on how well you do. You'd leave Nantes Saturday, day after tomorrow. All right. You'll sail on the Duchess Anne anchored in the harbor. The captain will be informed. Destination: Amsterdam. You'll then fly to Port Elizabeth. Let me finish. From there a friend will drive you to Johannesburg. You'll give him this briefcase, and he'll give you a similar one in return... which you'll kindly bring back here. That's all? That's all. - Like in a fairy tale. - Then you'll do it? Give me 24 hours. I suggest you say yes now. - And if I tell the police? - That would be a mistake. I'll do it. Here's your passport. You're Mr. Jean Maillard. Put your picture in it. The captain will stamp it. Here's a small advance. - And the briefcase? - Come for it tomorrow at this time. One more thing. I don't know you. You don't know me. I'm exhausted! Shopping drives me crazy. All those people and cars! Mr. Cassard's very nice. Everyone's nice, except for a few people, perhaps. You mustn't think the whole world's rotten. Some people deserve our trust. Some are good, even if appearances can deceive. You can't judge a book by its cover. Stop fussing about. You're wearing me out. He has a nice face. He expresses himself well. I wonder what he does for a living. C?cile, bring me my slippers. After all, he didn't have to bring that book by. It's very nice of him. Don't forget to thank him. Perhaps we could invite him to stay for dinner. It would be one way to get to know him. But is that really necessary? What do you think? No comment? What are you doing? Nothing, Mother. Turn off that radio. And where are my slippers? I always have to repeat myself 50 times. I'm sure you haven't written to your Uncle Aim? yet. You know how easily he takes offense. If your father were still alive - What's wrong? - You're always scolding me. - For your own good, my child. I'm not a child. I'll be 14 tomorrow. You're an angel. The doorbell! It's Mr. Cassard! Go let him in. I can't receive him like this. It's Suzanne. It's Suzanne? Please hurry. Here are my books. Lend me yours. Not now. I'm too nervous. We're expecting a guest. Wait. - The Desnoyers residence? - Yes. C?cile! Hello. Here. Come in. Here's the book I promised you. - You're very kind. - It's nothing. May I keep it? - As long as you like. - Hot damn! That's rather coarse language. I won't say it again. Do you speak English? - Sometimes. We just got in. Please don't mind the mess. Mr. Cassard speaks English sometimes. I went to the States with my father once. I was only five. I've studied on my own since. Have you studied a lot? Not all that much. I started working very young. My parents were poor. Then they got divorced. He was a sailor. She was always waiting for him. One day she quit waiting and married a railroad man. But he was never home either. She had no luck. I'd love to travel. I'm sorry, but I must go. I have a date - coincidentally, with that childhood friend whom C?cile resembles. Isn't that funny! I just ran into her. You recognized each other after all these years? She recognized me. She's lovely. Maybe I'll look like her later. Maybe. She's a dancer. See, Mother? Just what I want to be. Childish fancies. She'll change her mind. You must come again, Mr. Cassard. Would you dine with us Saturday? That's impossible. I'll be traveling again, for a job, and Saturday I'll be off the coast of Cherbourg. Small world! My brother-in-law Aim? is a hairdresser there. Look. Put that picture back. You were a dancer? No, it was for a masquerade. What about dinner tomorrow for C?cile's 14th birthday? Tomorrow? Yes, I'd love to. - Until tomorrow, then. See you tomorrow. A charming young man, isn't he? - I'm hungry. - Yes, set the table. C?cile, answer when I speak to you. Yes, Mother. One day I'll be a dancer. - We'll see. For now, set the table. - What's for dinner? With all the commotion, I forgot about dinner. I'm hungry- Go buy some eggs and some fruit, whatever you'd like. Apples and pears... Give me some money. I'll buy my M?t?or comics too. Don't forget my change. And don't dawdle. - M?t?or, please. - Help yourself. Darn! They're all gone. He took the last one. Give me my money back. - Pick something else. - Can't I read what I want? Yeah, I bet! - Please accept it. - I don't know you. Please. If you insist. It'd be silly to refuse. Care for some? "'Let's land on that strange planet.' A moment later, the spaceship touched down. 'Where are we? I've lost my bearings.' The professor asked, 'Is this planet inhabited?' To be continued." I think it is. You? - Me too. Good. Look, the fair! I'm coming with Suzanne. - Who's she? A friend in my class. You understand everything I say? Almost. I'm learning French. I'm learning English, but American's almost the same. Talk American and see if I understand. Not a word! But I only just started. I had one hour on Friday, but I'll learn fast. Besides, a man we met brought me a dictionary that will come in handy. - How old are you? - I'm a minor. I'll be 14 tomorrow. My sister in Chicago is 14 too. She looks like you. - Does she speak French? She's learning. She wants to be a teacher. I'd never want to be a teacher. I want to be a dancer, but Mother says no. But I don't care. I don't care about anything! Drat! I'm gonna be in trouble. I forgot to buy eggs. My name's C?cile. What's yours? - Hi, everyone. - Frankie came by to see you. - What'd he want? - He didn't say. - Do you love him? - Frankie? You only love once. For me, it already happened. I like him a lot. - He's leaving tomorrow. - They came from Saint-Nazaire. Their ship's being overhauled. Then they're off to Cherbourg. Too bad. They were cute. Daisy, lend me your lipstick. I can't find mine. I have to rehearse. I'm not sure I have time. No, this isn't my color. Thanks. Can I borrow some lipstick? Catch. Thanks. Where's your little boy? We never see him. He's at school. School's important, right? Bianchini called. He's offering two months in Marseilles. Interested? Bianchini? No, thanks. You go to Marseilles and end up in Argentina. No, this is legit. He needs an answer tomorrow. Nelly, you interested? I don't know. I'll think it over. H?l?ne? I can't. I'm leaving for Paris. That's pretty. Where'd you get it? I spruced up my black corset. You didn't recognize it? It's gorgeous. I should sew some fancy stuff on mine. Something flossy, you know? And something glittery here. It'd look great. And a big plume like Marilyn Monroe's. But I have no time. - Of course not. What do you mean by that? Anyway, I want to rehearse. Can I have some music? What are you doing? - Stringing beads. It's me... Lola! The girl who laughs at anything and says love's a lovely thing Wins men's hearts without fear and gives without a tear To older guys or brave young men is always asking where or when Likes to please them every day without going all the way It's me... Lola! I see a shin tied to a buoy Then I meet a sailor boy We sing and we dance We play with romance We whirl and we spin Then I say with a grin That I mean no, it's time to go That's enough, don't get rough It's me... Lola! I say, "Oh, please come back!" Then I laugh behind your back But I'm lost in a dream One that's not a scheme It's all peaches and cream! He'll take me in his arms and show me That out of thousands he will know me You, you! It's true! It's me... Lola! - What time is it? - What? 7:30. I have to run! I have a date at 8:00. - With Frankie? No, a childhood friend I hadn't seen in 15 years. I just bumped into him! Have a drink first? I don't have time. Bye. Feel! I washed my hair. It's all silky. I came to take you to dinner. I have a date. Are you alone? I lost the other guys. I've looked all over. On the docks, in town - I can't find them. I'll be here tonight. Come back then. I hope I'm not late. No, it's 8:00 on the dot. I thought I'd never make it. I've been running all day. I had to rehearse at the club, then pick up the kid at school. The days fly by. We're getting old! Would you hold this? Thanks. I must look a fright. No, like that. Thanks. One must look attractive - a cardinal rule. What did you do? I got fired, so I went to a movie, and then I ran into you. - That's awful! - Running into you? - Losing your job. - Not really. Mommy, my trumpet. Later. Shops are closed now. Another rule - never thwart a child's wishes. Is that better? Where shall we go? - Anywhere you like. Let's stop by my place, and I'll put him to bed, and change shoes, 'cause these are killing me. Then we'll go for a quiet dinner. - All right. This place came furnished. I had my mother's apartment till she got evicted and died. People laugh when I say she died from being evicted, but it's true. Make yourself at home. Yvon, come along. Hurry up. Have a drink while I put him to bed. I'll be with you in a sec. You like whiskey? There's some on the table. Some Americans brought it to the club. You should come see me dance at the Eldorado. I've got a pretty good number. - Some for you, C?cile? - No, I can't stand it. I laugh because no one calls me C?cile anymore. My stage name is Lola, so everyone calls me that. Put on a record if you like. Into bed! Will I get a trumpet? Yes. Now go to sleep. You say your prayers? Yes, Mommy. I hate leaving him alone. It's better now, but when he was younger, I didn't dare leave him alone. Cheers. I'd never recognize you with that hair and makeup. - Is it too much? - No, it's fine. I have to do it for my work. And like I said before, I like to look attractive. I'll put on a dress. Last time I saw you, you had braids. I must have looked hideous! I must have been about ten. Tell me about yourself. Oh... What will you do now that you're unemployed? I'm going on a trip. Like that time before? Remember how you went on and on about the States? What have you done these past ten years? Nothing special. A little of everything. Is the back all right? I sold lighters, washers, curling irons... ties, and even life insurance. - Was it laziness or what? - No, it wasn't that. I was ambitious, like everyone else. And now you're not? No. I'm the quintessential failure. I did nothing but daydream. Now I'm lost and bored. You've changed so much. Didn't you play violin? I had to quit during the war, and when I tried to start again, I'd forgotten everything. And I had to make a living. That's when I sold lighters. It's no excuse. I simply lacked courage. Sometimes I regret it. You might have been a great violinist. I was awful. Still, the damn war - I was also in love with you. You're just saying that. No, I'm serious. But I kept it to myself. That was nice. Shall I wear a jacket? I guess I will. Go to sleep, sweetie. Kids fall asleep so quickly. They take up so much space. My life's so different with him here. You'll see one day. - I doubt it. - Why? - One doesn't have to have kids. - Don't you like them? Very much, but having a child is serious business. Most people have kids by accident. I think only a child who's really wanted is happy. Weren't you wanted? Not exactly. People think like that before they have kids, but it's not true. Isn't life a beautiful thing? In theory, but what we do with it isn't always great. Was he an accident? Sort of. We could have eaten here, but it's so complicated. - I'll take you out. - I'd love that! As a kid, I dreamed of being tall, with a nice figure, and of being a dancer - at the Opera, of course. Seems I took a wrong turn somewhere. But I have no regrets. I was happy once. That came later. It was during carnival. There was a fair with rides. This tall guy appeared. He was big and blond. Tall as a house. He was dressed up as an American sailor, all in white, with a little cap. It was my 14th birthday. I fell in love with him on the spot. Must be what people call love at first sight. Then he left... and I didn't see him for ages. But I never stopped thinking about him. I thought he'd forgotten me, but one day he came back. It was Pentecost Sunday, a beautiful day. He took me to the seashore. His name was Michel. That's when the "accident" happened, as you call it. When I told him I was pregnant, he disappeared. Bastard! Not necessarily. He was very nice. I didn't know him well, but he was very nice. He said he'd make a great dancer out of me. I may not be a great dancer, but I'm a good mother. Sometimes I think he'll come back. I can't believe he really just abandoned me. He was very kind too. He couldn't bear the idea... of having a child he couldn't raise properly. You think I'm crazy. You're laughing at me. Let me have a cigarette. I'm all out. Wait here. Thank you, sir. I'd like to check on my boy before going to the club. If you like. But why'd he leave you if he loved you? A chance suddenly came up for a good job in the colonies. He was to come back soon... but he didn't. - You'd have been disappointed if he had. - Not necessarily. He's probably a bore who smokes a pipe while he plays the stock market. And he's probably fat and bald now. What? That's funny! I've never thought of him like that! He's sleeping like a log. He looks so much like his father. Maybe that's why I can't forget him. Try! Look at me. I made foolish choices. I was adrift for ten years, either tired or bored. Now I'm setting out again. We can't just give up. You met a louse, but there are other guys. Maybe one's waiting for you now. Don't bother yourself about me. I'm just a silly girl boring you with her sob stories. But I was so happy to see you again. I know it's not much fun for you. I'm furious with myself, but it's over now. - You going far? - Johannesburg. The ends of the earth. Too bad. You could have cheered me up. I'll be back. Does this happen often? What? Feeling blue? No, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not usually like this. I'm the cheerful type. In fact, I can't stand moaning sob sisters. But tonight, with you and my memories, it's all crashed down on me. It's so stupid. Maybe he'll come back. For some reason I'm sure he will. One's first love is so intense. Oh, I've got to run! I go on at midnight! Are my eyes red? Can you tell I've been crying? Come inside. It'll cheer you up. I don't feel like it. - You'll say good-bye before you go? - Of course. Everyone to bed now. Daisy, behave yourself! Get up. Off to bed. Let's go, Maggy. On your feet! I want to sleep at your place. I said no. Find a hotel with your pals. I'm broke. Besides, I don't like drunks. And I feel sad. I'm leaving tonight. We'll never meet again. I brought this for your son. He asked me for one. Time to go. All right, but on one condition: You have to behave. Swear it. - I swear. - You're up early. - Coffee. You look awful. You sick? No, I had a nice night. I strolled around until dawn. - Yeah, right. - What? - You slept in another's bed. - Maybe you did too. - Did you go see Valentin? - Yes, thanks. It's a shady deal. A trip to Amsterdam and Johannesburg. Why shady? Just is. A mysterious deal with a briefcase. An ordinary leather briefcase with a handle. I'm to take it unnoticed through customs. - And you agreed? - Of course. But now I don't want to leave. Why? It's absurd to look elsewhere for what's on your own doorstep. What have you found? Love, I think. - What now? - Roland's found love. Ah, youth. So life's wonderful again? Yes. But he's about to do something stupid. He has a job to go to Amsterdam and Johannesburg, but he refuses. - That's a strong word. - Isn't it true? Yes and no. - Where's Johannesburg? - South Africa. It's ruined. The sky ran into the sea. Looks like a melted candle. - Is my coffee coming? - Gimme a sec! People look great this morning. Love agrees with you. I feel like running up and kissing them. Go ahead. Take her with you to Johannesburg. No, impossible. Does she love you? I don't know. She doesn't even know I love her. Here. For the room and the loan yesterday. - There's no hurry. The hair salon's closed? - You too? - What? - Are you a cop too? - Why? Two cops came by, and I told them what I thought. Things have been going on - Quick. My cutie's already up and dressed. Look what Frankie brought you. You can play it later. Put your shoes on now. Stop that. Come on. What are you doing here? Do you leave today? No, just passing by. I brought this for Yvon. - What is it? - He wanted a trumpet. He'll like that. This is for you. - What is it? - A trumpet. - I have one. - Now you have two. Say thank you. I'm taking him to school. Want to come along? I can barely stand. I've had no sleep. We had sailors on leave who stayed till dawn. So much music and commotion! I think I'll sleep all day. Yvon, stop that. And stop dragging your feet. He won't listen. What's wrong with you? Me? Nothing. You're hiding something. You need money? Money? Don't be silly. You don't dare ask, is that it? No. Something else? Here we are. Yvon, you can't take your trumpet to school. It's a private school run by two hip old ladies. They feed him and everything. A regular school's out because I travel so much. Won't you tell me what's wrong? - Forget it. I wanted to tell you I'm not leaving now. Why? Because I love you. That's silly! I love you, and I have for ages. I told you I liked you years ago. Then I saw you again, and I don't know what happened. I walked around all night. I thought about our childhood, and all sorts of memories came flooding back... with you at the center of them all. I've lived on dreams till now. That was wrong. You give me a reason to live. You're not very happy. I'll work and help you. I'm no great shakes, but I'll get back on my feet. - It's impossible. - I can do it. That's not what I meant. I know you could. But it's best to be frank. I don't love you, Roland. I know I can always count on you, and I'll always try to help you, but I don't love you. I never dreamed you thought of me as anything more than a friend. We barely know each other. Call it love at first sight. You know how that is. At 16, yes, but we're not 16 anymore. Admit you just want to sleep with me. Of course I do. But I want the feeling to be mutual. You mad at me? What have I done to deserve this? I'm not mean. I try never to hurt people, yet I do, in spite of myself, when I'd really like everyone to be happy. What are you waiting for? Michel. He's the one I love. Michel and the American. What American? The one I saw go home with you this morning. - You've been spying on me? - You weren't exactly hiding it. There was nothing to hide! I don't deserve this! I thought you were a friend, but you're like all the other men. I've never had a male friend, just guys chasing after me. But I'm nobody special. I feel miserable. I can't take it anymore. And I'm so tired. If you knew how tired I am, you wouldn't torment me so. Calm down. Besides... I'm going away. I'm leaving town. With him? Who? The American. Yes, with the American. I'm going to America. Then the story about Michel was just a bluff? Yes. As you say, just a bluff. And I was going to stay here and turn down a great job! For some whore who runs off with the first guy she meets! I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. I'm tired too. - Let me explain - No explanation needed. I'll get over you quickly, believe me. You leaving? The others are waiting for me. - Did you sleep? - A bit. You've been crying. Did I make you sad? It wasn't you. Go on now. I really liked you. Farewell, Frankie. GIRLS' SCHOOL It's the American! - You know him? - He's my friend. I have your M?t?or. I lent it to Suzanne. Darn, I dropped everything. Here. - I don't want it. How's your English coming? You're making progress. It's too dangerous to stay here. If my teacher sees us, it'll mean trouble. I'll never hear the end of it. A classmate got expelled 'cause a boy came by with candy for her every day. You coming? I'm talking! Sometimes she won't leave me alone! That's Suzanne. Go on if you want! How do you say anniversaire in American? Anniversaire is "birthday." Today's my birthday. Want to go to the fair? - Good-bye, C?cile. - Will I ever see you again? - If you come to Chicago someday. - That's sad. I'm taking the train with them in a while. I'll be in Saint-Nazaire tonight, in Cherbourg on Sunday, and then America. It hurts to say good-bye. Good-bye, little girl. You see the time? Where were you? Why is your hair like that? - It's nothing. If I hadn't had dinner to fix, I'd have gone to your school. I'm always afraid what might happen. - Like what? No homework now. Mr. Cassard's coming, and nothings ready. Where were you? School was out two hours ago. Suzanne and I were talking. She wants to be a hairdresser like Uncle Aim?. What an idea! It's a fine profession. - What are you making? - Onion tart. Oh, I'll never get it. And I saw Frankie outside my school. The American sailor. I told you about him. A sailor? - What's all this about? - I didn't do anything wrong. I should hope not! You're to stay away from servicemen, and other men too... for now. - He was very nice. - All the more reason. "Was"? He left. He helped me get a good grade in English. I knew words the other girls didn't. You know how Americans say anniversaire? "Birthday." We had such fun at the fair... with Suzanne. The fair! With a man you don't even know! My daughter out partying with servicemen and getting home at 7:00! And me, sick with worry, fearing the worst! Put your things away and set the table. All this fuss 'cause I was five minutes late! It's not because you were late. And watch your tone. I try to be pals with you and look what happens. Fix your hair right now! Forks left, knives right - I've told you a hundred times! - Don't start crying! I'm not. Where was this sailor from? Chicago, Illinois. A sailor from Chicago - you and your geography! Chicago has no sailors, only gangsters! - You always think the worst. - I know what I'm saying. A dancer! A sailor's girl! If you have a child, it's for a lifetime! I like children. It's Mr. Cassard! We only just met, and our first meal is a farewell dinner. Why are you leaving? Certain events that I prefer to keep to myself have turned my admittedly dreary life upside down. I have no reason to stay here. It's none of my business. It must be serious. A woman... Probably unfaithful. I have no right to judge her. She lives with the memory of her first love, and one's first love is so intense. Why, Mother? It just is. You were saying? Anyway, she's going away with another man. An American. - I met an American too. Stop interrupting. You're too young for this conversation. My daughter goes out with Americans! - Just one. - Even worse! Just where did you meet? - The tobacco shop. - What were you doing there? - Buying M?t?or. No, thank you. I don't smoke. Oh, why not? One won't hurt. - Me too. - You're awful. When are you leaving? I sail tomorrow. Why did he say one's first love is so intense? You explain. She's always hounding me with questions. Because it's the first time, and it rarely happens again. And if it does, it's not the same. - Not as good? - Different. Then we mustn't miss the boat. You're going to lose a button. I'll sew it back on. Give me your coat. She's unbearable. She's right. It would have fallen off. It's so hard for a woman to raise a child alone. I'm all alone. I lost everything during the war. My mother, my house, furniture, books... my husband. I had nothing left. Not even a handkerchief or a sheet. I became a penniless widow overnight. You see, my husband was a gambler. He had every vice. God save us from gamblers. You're not a gambler, are you? I should have married a man like you. My brother-in-law in Cherbourg very kindly took me in. I stayed there two years. C?cile was born there. But I didn't like Cherbourg, so I moved back here. - There. - Thank you. - Have some more cake. - No, I must go. - Already? - I have a lot to do before I leave. I won't insist. C?cile, come say good-bye. I'm sorry I wasn't better company. We'll be quite lonely. Well, farewell. You're not forgetting anything? I sail at 1:00. I saw the captain. I have my passport. Here's the key. I left a few things in the room. Do as you like with them. - And your great love? - All over. Then it wasn't very serious. It was, but it doesn't matter now. You get over things quickly. One does one's best. It took me 25 years. I know. One's first love is so intense. How do you know? So I've been told. My first love was long ago. I'm off to see Valentin. I'll pick up my bag later. Keep moving! Go on! - What's going on? - Diamond smuggling at the hair salon. Smuggling hair I could understand. Can you imagine? Diamonds! Keep moving! There's nothing to see! - Remember what I told you? - Yes. I was looking for you to say good-bye. I couldn't leave with you mad at me. Forgive me. I got carried away yesterday. I was stupid and cruel. I spoke without thinking. I said just anything, and I'm sorry now. I know you try to live as best you can, and that it's not easy. I wish you lots of happiness. I hoped to share it with you, but oh well. Yes, I know. I wanted to tell you - I couldn't let you leave without confessing that I lied. Lied? I'm not leaving with the American. With whom then? No one. I'm leaving alone. Well, with Yvon. The American meant nothing. I only slept with him because he reminded me of Michel. Maybe it was the uniform too, a memory from childhood. But I didn't love him. He's gone, and I'll never see him again. Why make all that up? I was so confused. I hadn't expected to run into you. I didn't want to hurt you. I thought you'd forgive me if there was someone else. Smart thinking. Not really. It may not mean much to you, but I didn't want you to think badly of me. I'm not some whore who runs off with the first guy she meets. Forgive me. I'm leaving for a two-month gig in Marseilles. Marseilles! You'll leave for Marseilles and end up in Argentina. That's funny! That's exactly what I said! No, it's a real gig. So Michel wasn't a bluff? No, he's the only guy I've ever loved. If he ever comes back, I may be disappointed, but at least my conscience will be clean. I'll have waited for him like a good girl. And if he doesn't come back? - I don't know. - I do. You'll have ruined your life. I've thought a lot about you and me. It doesn't matter now. It's not your fault or mine. It's just how it is. We're alone, and we stay alone. But what counts is to want something, no matter what it takes. There's a bit of happiness in simply wanting happiness. I wanted nothing until I saw you again. But now... I see you're right. It's great to be alive. You think I should throw myself in your arms and thank you. - That'd be a miracle! - It may happen. Roland, we're not kids anymore. Let's part as friends. We mustn't push things. We've led such different lives. It's hard. How long will you be gone? I don't know. The guy who hired me just got arrested. I don't know what I'll find there, but I'll play it by ear. The main thing is to leave. I'll be back in two months. We'll have thought it over. Perhaps we - I mean, if you really love me - Do you doubt it? No, I think you're sincere. But two months isn't forever. It's two months wasted. At least give me a smile. You can do better than that. Hello. Did you hear? - What? C?cile's gone off to her uncle's in Cherbourg. - It's awful. - Let's not exaggerate. She must have left this morning. She left this note. Read for yourself. After you left, she made an awful scene. "L can't take it. If everyone else is leaving, then I am too! School's boring. Uncle Aim? will teach me hairdressing." And she burst into tears. I told myself she'd forget all about it by morning. This morning she was gone. What was she thinking? She wanted to be a dancer, not a hairdresser! One must never thwart a child's wishes. If you knew how awful the situation is. My brother-in-law is her father. - So? - I never wanted her to find out. That's ridiculous. - You think? - Of course. I haven't seen him in 10 years, but he writes constantly. I can't decide. I'll go to Cherbourg at once. Weren't you leaving too? - What time is it? - 12:30. - My ship sails at 1:00! - And I'll miss the train! Anyone here? Coming! Can I help you? - You don't recognize me? - Excuse me? Don't you recognize me? Michel. Jeanne, come quick! You killed her! - You haven't changed! - You neither! Get some vinegar and a towel! I knew it! You could have at least spared your mother. I'm not here to be scolded. - She's breathing. - Of course. Michel, my son! - She can talk! - It's just the emotion. - Don't move. - I'm not dying. I have great news. - Not again! - Let him talk. Mother, I'm rich! You hear me? Rich! I'm not deaf. That's all you can say? - There are other kinds of riches. - I know. Never mind her ranting. Tell me everything. I've come back to get married. My wife and child are waiting for me. After seven years? You're dreaming. - Some welcome. - Is she here? She dances at the Eldorado. A dancer! Look after Mother, will you? - You're off again? - I have things to do. Michel's come back for his wife - a dancer! A dancer! That's all I needed. He hasn't changed. I recognized him right off. Then I fainted. It's silly to be so emotional. I'll get my bag. - You're leaving us? - Farewell, Jeanne. Michel will be right back. You can meet his wife. Thanks, but I don't have time. - Will we see you again? - No, I won't be coming back. Bye, my little chickie. If you ever need us, we'll be here. Thank you. Bye, kitten. We'll miss you. - Come and visit. Bye, my little treasure. Be careful. - I'm not crazy. Bye. angel. - You'll see Marseilles. - I'll think of you. Bye, sweetie. Send us a postcard. - Of course. Bye, darling. Come back and see us. Hurry, Lola. You'll miss your train. Looking for someone? It's Michel! Your son. Yvon, come kiss your father. - A son! He looks like you. Well, don't just stand there. I was so afraid. I thought you'd never come back. Seven years! Can you imagine? If you knew how I've waited and thought only of you, but I cursed your memory too for making my life miserable. I tried everything to forget you, but I couldn't. - Forgive me. - I doubted you so. I wanted to come back, but I couldn't. I was broke, on an island 12,000 miles away. Matareva, in the Pacific. I thought of you constantly. I couldn't do a thing. Months passed by. I thought, "She's forgotten me." Then slowly... my life changed, and my confidence returned. But I didn't dare come back to France to see you. I've been here three days... wandering around town. Today I came to a decision, and if you want... if you still love me - Good-bye. Music! Champagne! Let's have some fun! What's wrong? Nothing.
