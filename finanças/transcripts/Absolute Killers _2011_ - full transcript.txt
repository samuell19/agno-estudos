[HEAVY BREATHING] [CAR RUMBLES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [FOOTSTEPS] I'm sorry. [THEME MUSIC] [THEME MUSIC FADES OUT] Looks like I'll be seeing your father... sooner than I planned. Well, I'll finally... get to thank him face to face... for taking that bullet for me. [DOOR SLAMS] Seen my wife? She's in the bedroom. Gilda! [GOONS MUMBLE] Affairs aren't nearly as much fun... Gilda! when you're the one being cheated on. Especially when it's in the family. Cooler heads... must prevail. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC FADES OUT] [GILDA AND ANTHONY YELLING IN THE BACKGROUND] I know you're not your brother's keeper. He'll be the first to say we're not brothers. Still, he respects you. He hates my guts. If I could, I would leave... the family business to you. Thank you. [GILDA YELLING IN THE BACKGROUND] To tell the truth, I'm way more entrenched that I ever wanted to be. I'm here for you, and only you. You've got to promise me, you'll do whatever it takes to protect the family. I think of you as a son, even though you're not blood. [MAX COUGHS] Good one. Matches my outfit. Your parents would be proud of you. ANTHONY: NO! [LOUD THUD] ANTHONY: NO! I don't think so. Max is dying. How did you get your hands on his medical records? - Well... - There's no court order here. Concierge doctors. You pay more than their patients or dig up a little dirt. You know I don't approve of your tactics. - We can't use this in court. - Every bit of intel helps. How long has he got? Scum's a tough old bird. He's going to hang on for months. I hope he dies slowly and painfully. That'll put... - Anthony in charge. - The most sadistic. God help us. Don't hold your breath. I'm not having this debate with you today. But what I can't figure out... is this guy. They have someone clever in there, laundering their dirty money through philanthropy, raw land, franchises, as you name it. Even our best accountants can't track it back. Yeah... this guy's the brain of the bunch. Hopefully our housecleaning operation on the call girl ring will stop their cash flow for a minute. We need more. We really need a break. I got to run. I have hot meal duty today at church. What kind of people you going to church with? Come with me and find out. No. I feel naked without it. It's called trust issues. Yeah, well, I have enough of them for a lifetime. Do you blame me? - Bye. - Bye. Have fun at church, with your gun. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Wait in the car, Johnny. Nobody comes in. You understand? Come on. Get out. Get out. Hey. Kid! Get out of here. Go! Get in there. [BELLS CHIME] ELIZABETH: Susan. SUSAN: Hey. You know that break you asked for earlier? Yeah, I actually prayed for one. Why? Maybe there is someone up there, listening to you at least. An Italian stallion in the Torino stable has been dipping his wick in the heir-apparent's marital well. Dumb! How do you think you could get away with that? What? See you next month. Inside guy says that the boss to be is on the warpath. He's a sitting duck in the collections over the Gem Theater. A couple of guys are going over there to pick him up now. Catch him in the act. You know, basically, save his ass. If we rescue him and threaten to cut him loose, he might flip. - Cough up some intel. - You're reading my mind. They'll let you have a go at him once we get him in a controlled environment. All right. Thanks, Susan. How you doing, Cuz? Didn't expect to see you here. I like to keep my people on their toes. I had some business nearby. Killing two birds. Yeah. You two know each other, right? We've met. Everything adding up with the bookies? - Yep. - Unions paying on time? - Drug sales are steady. - And the girls? Not one's given the D.A. a thing. They know their place. Got to ask you, Cuz. What kind of fool parks his little scooter in my garage? Hunh? Hunh? [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR BANGS INTO JULIAN ANTHONY GRUNTS] [JULIAN SCREAMS] [BONE BREAKING THUD] She told me I was the best she'd ever had. Yeah... Well, she lied to me too. [SOCCER BALL BOUNCES] [DOOR SLAMS] Drop the gun! [SIRENS IN BACKGROUND] The People versus Anthony Torino. The charge: murder in the first degree. What's the plea? The plea's not guilty. And The People on bail? Miss Jones. It's not often we see the D.A. at a bail hearing. Exactly our argument, Your Honor. Thank you for making it for us. I mean, the prosecutorial bias in this case is unprecedented. I mean, there is clearly a conflict of interest when we have the supposed witness prosecuting the case. - You finished? - I'm done, thanks. Special circumstances. A.D.A. Jackson had a family emergency. The people strongly recommend this dangerous criminal be denied bail. He is a significant flight risk - and his family is notorious... - Ok, Your Honor, if our court system based guilt on familial association, I dare say we'd all be up here defending ourselves. Your Honor, this is the first time my client, the individual, not the whole family, has ever been charged with any crime of any sort. He was caught red-handed, at the scene of the crime, still holding the murder weapon. Your Honor, we... That's circumstantial, Your Honor. And self-defense. - How so? - My client walked in on his beloved wife being brutally beaten by his cousin after she rejected - his sexual advances. - That is ridiculous. It's a good thing he arrived when he did because Mister Torino saved her life. He is not the evil-doer, he is the hero. Your Honor, we request a case dismissal due to lack of admissible evidence. That's a bit premature, Mister Flanders. His fingerprints were lifted from the murder weapon. Ballistics match the slug that... Actually. No, Your Honor. Unfortunately for us, the police've misplaced the alleged murder weapon. Already anticipated, Your Honor. The Torinos do have ties, indeed. The fingerprints've been sent to the crime lab... Sadly, all the evidence that would have proven my client innocent has either been lost, destroyed, contaminated, or misfiled. The chain of custody in this case is so corrupted, there is no hope of the truth ever coming to light. - As such, Your Honor, I... - I get it! Next time, save the theatrics. Miss Jones. There are four eyewitnesses... Five, actually, Your Honor. Two of whom aren't willing to testify. They're not quite sure what they saw. We also have revised statements, Your Honor. One from Mrs. Gilda Torino, who, you can imagine, was very distraught. We also have one from a Mister Johnny Graham. He works for the Torino family, also witnessed the incident. I think his statement is... It is worthless. Your Honor, we're talking about a lackey driver on the Torino payroll. How is that even remotely credible? And I need to see a copy... I, too, am an eyewitness, there are two other witnesses. The forensic... - Why don't you save it... - Excuse me! Well... That was a lot of fun. Bail is set at one million dollars. Mister Torino will surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitoring device. Now, get out of my courthouse. [CREEPY MUSIC] [CAR DOOR CLICKS OPEN] [CAR DOOR SLAMS CAR ENGINE CRANKS] [CHILDREN YELLING] Chris, it's homework time. [TRIGGER] Well absolutely. I need to call you back. That was no gas leak. That was a hit. And Chris'd be dead too... I am telling you, we have got to get him and Angela into WITSEC ASAP. I know you're not a fan of the program, but it is the only way to keep them safe. It's just so unfair. We're taking them away from their families. Honey, Chris doesn't have any more family. Friends. Their entire lives. Spending the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders. Come on, Witness Protection, that's no way to live. It's the only way they can live. And let me remind you, we have another witness who is in equal danger. Oh no. No. Do not start. I am staying out here. I'm prosecuting this case. You know how hard I've been trying to get white collar charges to stick. If I could put Anthony Torino away for murder... Liz, you are in grave danger, personally. The man knows who you are. He knows where you live. I am you friend. I am just telling you like it is. They won't cross that line. I know that you don't trust anyone, except for that God of yours. But I am telling you, right now, you've got to put your faith in me. Please. Go home. Pack. I'll pass. Your Honor, the medical report on Misses Torino's bruises proves that they occurred many hours before this premeditated murder. The G.S.R. results and the fact that his victim's gun hadn't been touched in days, leaves no reasonable doubt as to Mister Anthony Torino's guilt. I beg you, for the safety of our community, to revoke his bail. He is a dangerous criminal who ought not be on the streets. Do you have a rebuttal to this evidence, Mister Flanders? A very detailed one, Your Honor. I was afraid of that. It's late. We'll reconvene Monday morning at nine A.M. Mister Torino, you may want to pack some spare underwear Monday. Miss Jones, what do you think the verdict will be? I, I'm confident, I'm confident that Mister Torino will be where he belongs, which is behind bars. Is Gilda Torino going to testify? Uh, no. His wife unfortunately still refuses to testify. How are you going to convince her to testify? - I, uh... - Just one more question. - Let's go. - How about the jury selection? I'm confident that any jury we seat will see Mister Torino for what he is, which is a brazen criminal who thinks he can kill in broad daylight. - A coward who believes... - I said, let's go. All right, let's go. So, you sure about this? It isn't your business, Johnny. When Max finds out. Max ain't going to find out. She ain't going to rest until there's a needle in my arm. You understand that? It's called self-defense. Then let me take her out. [LAUGHS] Yeah, right. Johnny grows up. [LAUGHS] Let me put some of that target practice to good use for once. There's a difference between shooting at a target and at a living being. You know you're going to be the number one suspect, no matter how this goes down. You've got a tracking device on your ankle. Let me drop you off somewhere public, really public. You make a lot of noise, and I'll take care of it. You're too chicken-shit to pull this off, Johnny. No one knows who I am. There's no one lower profile in the family. Just let me prove myself to you. You get one shot. Don't mess it up. Make sure this is at the bottom of Lake Norman before morning. Okay. [RAP ON CAR WINDOW] - Gah, man! [CAR DOOR SHUTS] What the hell are you guys doing here? Immoral support, hunh. She in there? No, man. I rapped on her door a half hour ago. - There's no one home. - Good. We can get a drop on her. - Crap! - Get up! Never take your eyes off the target. [HEAVY BREATHING] Look, can you guys just let me do this? Look at Johnny, becoming a man, hunh? - Ha ha. - Don't want an audience? Just stay here. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [ALARM KEYPAD BEEPS] Pssst. I'm sorry. Told you he could do it. [ALARM BEEPS] [ALARM SIREN BLARES] Finish the job, amateur! [GUNSHOTS] Get out of there Johnny! Let's go! [POLICE SIRENS BLARE] Get out of here! [CAR ENGINE] I can't believe they got Johnny. Oh, I believe it. Besides, it's no skin off my back. It couldn't have worked out better, except that D.A. is still alive. Johnny's not the marksman everyone thought he was. He just doesn't look the type. Oh Honey, they rarely do. No. No, there's something else going on here. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] I, uh. I'm no lawyer, but, this... this is like a huge, big way no-no. Isn't it? I mean. I managed to hold on to at least one bullet for forensics this time. So, I get why me. But why you? I don't follow. Your record's clean. Even your credit report is spotless. That's a crime now. This might not even be you. You're bright enough for identity theft. Okay. Well. Quiz me. - School? - Wharton. M.B.A. - Undergrad? - Wake Forest. - Parents? - Both deceased. Violent crime. What are you doing, neck deep, in the Torino cesspool? Max adopted me when I was... No, no. I read your file. I want answers. What happened to you? This might be news to you, but... You know, my family might look good on paper, but they worked for the Torinos, too. And you never learned from their mistakes? I didn't have much choice in the matter. Oh, you always have a choice. You wouldn't understand. I said I'm sorry and I meant it. Back up! Back up! Okay. Okay. So you said you were sorry. And that's going to make it all better? Aren't you Christians supposed to forgive and forget? Forgiveness doesn't eliminate the consequences. As a man sows, so shall he reap. Good old Paul, hunh? Yeah. You may know your bible, but you're obviously a stranger to its author. We've still got two witnesses we need to get to. You get their locations yet? Not yet. They sunk them deep into Witness Protection. Remember that cheating-spouse, car-jacking hit I did as a favor a few months back? I think it's about time I called in that chit. I am done playing with you. This is your chance. You can wipe the slate clean and start a new life. We've never lost any Witness. All you have to do is testify, and agree to a polygraph. That's it. You're just not listening to me. You don't have to wait months for a murder trial. Do you have a pen? All right, look. Anthony, he runs a private sub-s corporation. Nets him millions and millions of dollars. All right. You can easily nail him on tax evasion. Basically, the money comes in dirty over here, and comes out cleaned, sourced and seasoned over here. Great. What about Max, Vince? You're going to have to help us take down the entire family. JOHNNY: No. Look, I've given you Anthony and that's more, more than enough to warrant my freedom. I mean, he's the most dangerous to you, and everyone else; and you know that. What is this, honor among thieves? Max was like a father to me. What do you mean "was"? Is. He's going. But you're willing to turn in your brother. Vince is the closest thing I've had to a brother, and I'm not giving you him. Now Anthony, I'll give you him on a silver platter. You get to recoup all sorts of tax-payer money. Take the credit for it, and I'm out of here. So, you're the brains in the family. [HEART MONITOR BEEPS RHYTHMICALLY] You got any word yet from Johnny? VINCE: Not yet. I got a couple of names you can call to get him sprung. Anthony seems to think a little time in jail might do him some good. It's good medicine for Anthony, not for Johnny. I'm not dead yet. I'm still calling the shots here, you hear me. VINCE: Yes, sir. I'm in no hurry to chase Anthony around and cleaning up his mess anyway. That's why we need Johnny back here. Make sure Anthony listens to him. You get Johnny's back. He's always had yours. MAX: I've always been able to count on you, Vince. You can still count on me. [FUNKY MUSIC] That's not bad. What about these guys? JHONNY: What can I say? You'll have to testify. Testify? Why? Come on. I've given you everything. SUSAN: He's right. The family doesn't have to know where the information came from because we can prove it all now. Anthony Torino? Who wants to know? Mister Torino, we're going to have to place you under arrest. I think you might have your wires crossed, My hearing isn't 'til Monday morning. You're under arrest for racketeering, bank fraud, forgery, extortion. Okay. How about you give me a moment to say goodbye to my Pops. He's not well. He could pass away any time. Make sure there are no surprises. Detective: Let's go. Can I at least get a little privacy? [DOOR BANGS CLOSED] [HEART MONITOR BEEPS RHYTHMICALLY] [SPOOKY MUSIC] [SPOOKY MUSIC FADES OUT] MAX: Anthony, my son. Your boy, Johnny, turned on us, Pop. He did this. ANTHONY: I'm sorry. ANTHONY: I'm sorry Pop. MAX: Vince. Vince. [HANDCUFFS CLICK] MAX: Don't let Anthony kill Johnny too. Make Anthony give Johnny another chance. You make him. I promised Graham, when he died in my arms, to take care of Johnny. Now you promise me. VINCE: You have my word. [HEART MONITOR STOPS ALARMS SOUND] ANTHONY: I need a crew. Old-timers only. You understand? FRANK: Only guys we've used for years. Got it, Boss. [CAR CRANKS AND SCREECHES OUT] ANTHONY: You owe me for taking care of that problem you had. I don't want to hear any more excuses, you understand? You get their identities and locations to Vince, pronto; because whether I'm in here or I'm out, I can always reach you. GUARD: Your dad died. Told you I'd be seeing you soon. You take care of that business, or else. ELIZABETH : I'll take the bar all over again, in whatever state you put me in. Susan : We can't, Liz. That's the first thing they'll look for. We're protecting you. Give this new life a fair chance. [THEME MUSIC] [THEME MUSIC FADES OUT] [GUNSHOTS] [SHEEP BLEET] ELIZABETH: This good for you. Tell Joe I said "hello", okay? You could to go try them on. ELIZABETH: Anyone know who this is? CHILD: Noah. Yep, that's Noah. So,many years went by after God made people. Many families lived in the world, but most of them did not obey God. But Noah obeyed God. Police Officer: Unit fifty-three arriving at Wise Funeral Home... supervised visitation by inmate Anthony Torino. [CHANTING FUNERAL DIRGE] [CHANTING FUNERAL DIRGE FADES OUT] FUNERAL HOME DIRECTOR: I'm sorry for your loss. I'll give you a few minutes. FUNERAL HOME DIRECTOR: It's time. [GUNSHOT] ANTHONY: No witnesses this time. [GUNSHOT] [CHAINS CLANK ON FLOOR] ANTHONY: Go! Go! Go! ANTHONY: Go! Go! Go! [CAR CRANKS AND SCREECHES OUT] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] VINCE: Any last words? JOHNNY: Just two: thank you. Don't take all the fun out of this. Vince, if I knew my life was going to come to this, I would have let Anthony get away with murder. I mean, a fricking sheep farmer! Are you kidding me! VINCE: -Beg for your life! JOHNNY: -I would, if I had one! There's a difference between being alive and barely living. VINCE: Look who's getting all philosophical. JOHNNY: Well, despite the circumstances. VINCE: Good to see you. You're not very good at this, huh? JOHNNY: Not really. VINCE: Max was really hurt by your betrayal. JOHNNY: I didn't betray him and he knows that. VINCE: How do you figure? JOHNNY: I said I would do what's best for the family, and that's what I did. VINCE: It wasn't in Anthony's best interests. Anthony's not what's best for the family, and you know that. I had no choice. - You always have a choice. - Not any that I wanted. No one ever said life is fair. Now look who's getting all philosophical. Vince, I wanted out. I wanted to just, I don't know, start a new life. VINCE: But you can't. Nah. I can't. But I can give you your old one back. Now that sounds tempting. I never thought it would, but it does. Anthony will shoot me on sight. But with him in jail, Max can pull rank. Give me another shot. Don't get much news out here, do you? - What do you mean? - Max wanted just that. Give you another shot. That was his dying wish. Or should I say, before Anthony put him out of his misery. You're the best, Johnny. I need you. I know where the D.A.'s hidden. JOHNNY: All right. Well, let me have another chance. Kind of blew up in your face the last time, didn't it. JOHNNY: I know. Please. VINCE: All right. Here's the D.A. Uh oh, Karen, we're running low on these sandwiches. Brussels sprouts. People keep giving us Brussels sprouts. Who eats Brussels sprouts? ELIZABETH: Brussels sprouts. KAREN: No. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CRATE CLACKS ON FLOOR] KAREN: Erin, you okay? ELIZABETH: Yeah I'm No, I'm fine. You sure? I'm okay. I'll get this. Ooh, this one's heavy. [DOOR CREEKS OPEN] [BOARDS CREEK UNDERFOOT] I'm losing my mind. [FOOTSTEPS] JOHNNY: Shhhh. Have you seen Erin? Have you? Erin? ELIZABETH: SQUEALS JOHNNY: Shhhh. Get in! Erin? Erin! Somebody call the police. They just took Erin. [TAP ON WINDOW] [FOLDER HITS TABLE] Forty years. Forty years in WITSEC, we haven't lost one single witness. Now you're telling me what? We've got two, in the last few days. Look, I know she was a friend of yours. Is. Is a good friend, Mike. And this, is Johnny Graham, another witness who disappeared yesterday. He's worked for the Torinos for years. Second generation, as a matter of fact. Thank you, Susan. I read the history report. Then you should know he's probably the one who kidnapped Elizabeth. Mike: Yeah. Well, how'd he find out where she was? Because I'm telling you right now, if they've hacked into our system, then God help us. We can do without his help. We have over seventeen thousand people in WITSEC. Now those people gave up their lives to help us out. Now someone here tell me that that's not all compromised. You're blowing this way out of proportion. Both disappearances are linked the Torino case. It has everything to do with that family. I want the names of every person that has accessed the file - on both those two. - We have one safeguard on top of another. Well, how's that working? Not too good, huh. Get those other two witnesses in a safe house. - And get Marshal Stark on this. - Oh, come on. Not Stark. He's the best eighteen-eleven we've in the field. And if this isn't a special op, I don't know what is. Well, now people! [TRAIN HORN SOUNDS AND CROSSING BELLS DING] [CAR SCREECHES AROUND CORNER] Hey. Hey. Stay calm now. Stop. Stop. Please, just let me out. - Look. - Let me out I promise I won't - Shhhh. - ...press any charges. Look. Just tell me where Chris and Angela are. Okay? Okay? Look! [PLASTIC TIE SNAPS OFF] - Please. - No. No. What? You would have been dead twice, twice if it wasn't for me. I've, I, I mean I saved you. -You saved me! -Yeah. If you wasn't such a lousy shot, I'd be dead! You tried to kill me! I can shoot a fly off a bottle. I, uh. I never had any intention of ever, ever killing you. Why on earth would I let you trip that alarm. They found you once, and they can find you again. You're a lot safer with me than you are with them. I swear to God, you'd better just trust me. Don't swear to God. I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't want to do this. [CAR HISSES TO A STOP] [CAR DOORS SLAM SHUT] - You know how to fix a car? - Do you know how to fix a car. No. I'm an accountant. [TRUCK RUMBLES TO A STOP] - Come on. - What? [COUNTRY MUSIC TWANGS] Hi, Mam. How you doing tonight? CASHIER: Fine, thanks. How about you? I'm good. I'm good. Quiet. CASHIER: It is very quiet in here. Quiet in here tonight. Yeah. Peanuts. I love peanuts. How, how much is this. Cashier: Twelve dollars. - Saint Christopher. - Yeah, patron St of travelers. How much for uh, peanuts? Cashier: Three ninety-eight. DAN: You Catholic? Southern Baptist, but I've got friends and uh, we're kind of traveling. - That your car out there? - Yes. It doesn't look like you're going very far. No, hunh. You need a lift? Yes. Yes, that would be great. I'd really appreciate that. All right. I can handle that. ELIZABETH: You coming? DAN: Which way you two headed? JOHNNY: Oh, anywhere but here. DAN: I've hear that before. [TRUCK ENGINE HUMS] [TRAVELING MUSIC] JOHNNY: Look, they got to the D.A. before I even got there. Do you have the locations of the others? Look, I'll start heading in that direction right now. Just call me when you get the addresses for the other ones. Okay, yeah. Well, we'll probably be in Charlotte by tomorrow evening. [FIST SLAMS ON TABLE] JOHNNY: I'll probably be in Charlotte by tomorrow evening, I hitched a ride with a truck driver. Yeah, all right, man. All right. Be cool Bye. Bye. Let me use your phone. Not if you're calling WITSEC. WITSEC is a federal program. I worked for the state. We can't trust anyone right now. When are you going understand that? I don't know where the others are at. But if you'd let me use your phone to make one phone call, I can probably get that information. Just let me use your phone. Hey. No grabby-grabby. I'm going to bed. - Maybe you should... - Don't talk to me. - Don't talk. - Talk. Don't talk to me. MIKE: Hey. How you holding up? SUSAN: I've had better days. Any word on our missing couple? SUSAN: Not yet. Stark says he's on it but he's pulling his usual lone ranger, keeping everybody in the dark. You got any news? Yeah. We found a back door into the database. Lets you switch users and completely bypass the fingerprint and retina scans. Brilliant. Lowest bidder contracted that software. Tssst. MIKE: Well, according to our computer log, every single user in the office has accessed the files on those four witnesses, including myself and you. - How is that possible? - Well, it's complicated. But if you've a user name, a password and you know what you're doing, you can pull it off. Cover your tracks. Well then it would have to be someone higher up. MIKE: Yeah. Someone like you. Yeah. That's funny. Don't be surprised if somebody else's answering my phone the next time you call me, though. It's only paranoia if someone's not really after you. Yeah, we've both made our fair share of enemies. Just call me, if you get something, all right. Be a whole lot easier to do if I were in charge. I know. You've made your point. Just watch your back. What's that? Tire tracks in the sand. DAN: Yeah. Reminds me that He's always with us, even in the worst of times. Even when we think we're on our own and, I've been there before. So I don't know how things can be so bad for you Johnny with this lovely lady on your arm. Oh, no. No. We're, we're not together. Ha! You could have fooled me. You're already at the bickering stage. Don't tell me you skipped the make-up sex. What's the fun in that? Heh-heh. [TRUCK ENGINE REVS] [TRUCK BRAKES HISS] [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] DOOR SLAMS SHUT DAN: Heh-heh-heh. Women. You know what? Order me the big breakfast 'cause I've just got to check the load, okay. All right, I'll be right there. And get the coffee. [DOOR LATCH JINGLES] [DAN POUNDS ON A BOX] DAN: Matt. Matt, do you need anything? - The fresh air is nice, man. - Okay, we've got two more stops before we get there. Nah. No, I think, I think I'm good. Got a minute? Want to show you something cool. Check this out. I was watching this sci-fi movie, totally not when I was working. And, so, I had a lot of time on my hands. And, I whipped this up, right. You can put this here. You can put it... DAN: Matt, you work on that. ELIZABETH: He's sure got us all wrong, huh? [COUNTRY MUSIC TWANGS] You know what? I really think weshould start trusting each other. Do you? Yes, I do. You know what I'm going to do? I'm gonna make the first move, because I'm that kind of guy. Please, don't make me regret this. I mean it. Oh, I see him. Yeah, back there. Where are you? What's going on? Are you okay? Listen, I only have a minute so you've to do me a favor. Would you please pick up Chris and Angela for me. I need you to do it personally, though. I can't do it. I'm out of it. Special ops had been assigned to the case now. How come they haven't gotten in touch with you. Where're you? Ah... I don't know. We're traveling on the road somewhere. "We're"? Are you with Johnny? Whoever you're with, can you trust them? Well, we don't ever really know who we can trust, right? Yeah, well. Good point. We've got some trust issues going on ourselves around here. ELIZABETH: My travel companion hasn't earnedmy trust yet. But I'm kind of between a rock and a hard place. Yeah, well, speaking of your travel companion, ballistics came back with the slug from your shoulder. It matches Johnny Graham's gun. - Well, yeah. - But that's not what's weird. It also matches the slug that killed the perp who tried to kill you. No, you mean the one that I killed? Well, that's what I'm saying. You didn't kill him. Your slug was pulled from his leg. His kill shot, that came from the same gun that shot you. [ALARM SIREN BLARES] JOHNNY: Aaah. [GUNSHOT] GOON: Finish the job. [GUNSHOTS] ELIZABETH: But that doesn't make any sense. If you can't pick up Chris and Angela, can you at least tell me where they are? Okay. Are you ready? Write this down as you know. DAN: I am the Lord your God. I'm holding your hand, so don't be afraid. I'm here to help you. Hmmph. Isaiah, forty-one, thirteen, right? Right as rain. If only that were true. I could sure use a helping hand right now. You never know where you might find an angel. DAN: Heh-heh-heh. Well, uh. Do you think you could take us by there? DAN: Ha. Heh-hee. Ah, you two are funny. All right. It's on the way. ["NO WAY OUT" PLAYS] DAN : You mind if I ask you a question? What happened to you? JOHNNY: What do you mean? DAN: Well, you know your bible so well. But it is obvious that at some point in your life, you lost faith. Yeah. That type of bitterness doesn't come from apathy. DAN: How did God let you down? ELIZABETH: And when? JOHNNY: Come on. Isn't it obvious? Look, I lost both of my parents. I was left with the Torinos. Tell me, what kind of God lets that happen? No! I get it. My parents were brutally murdered in front of me, and the guy that did it, he's as free as a bird. So, yeah. I've had my struggles with faith, with our legal system. But my faith sees me through. DAN: There's truth in that. JOHNNY: Let everyone else let us down so why not give God another chance to fail, hunh. ELIZABETH: Or see us through. [ELIZABETH TAPS ON WINDOW] DAN: All right. Here we are. Motel, right here. [TRUCK BRAKES HISS] ELIZABETH: Well, why don't you get some rest. Hey, um, this is room twenty-three. Can you please send a taxi? Yep, ten minutes is fine. Thank you. Hey, come on. I'll be back in like, twenty minutes, okay. JOHNNY: Come on. Come on. You don't have to go. I can do this. I'm okay. Why don't you stay here because I can handle it. I don't understand why nobody picked up Chris. Or it's a setup or they're watching the place. Whatever it is, I'd feel a lot better if he was here, like, with us. ANGELA: Poor kid. I mean, first his parents, now this. - I'm coming with you. - Well, I'm staying right here. - Will you lock the door? - Yeah. - Don't leave. - I won't. We need to hit a store where we can get some fake blood. [DOOR LOCK CLACKS] [PEBBLE CLACKS ON WINDOW] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Well, is this your stuff? [DOOR RATTLES SHUT] CHRIS: What are you guys doing here? Our locations've been compromised. We have to get out of here now. So we'll just grab this. Wait. Didn't you shoot her? - Yeah, he did. - Whatever. But we think he's with us now. We think. Let's just go. What am I using to tie him up with? JOHNNY: Just use this right here. ANGELA: Watching myself get strangled is creepy. You're sick, you know that? Well, you know what, you've got to know your audience. ANGELA: What is that? JOHNNY: Oh this. You don't want to know. Pssst. I'm sorry. [GUNSHOT] Stay down. Stay down. You'll have help soon, okay. I'm sorry. Why didn't you just kill me that night? What? I mean, it would have been a lot easier for you. Look, I could never hurt you. [MUTED SQUEELING] Hey Vinnie. Johnny finally did something right. Looks like he'd fun with her before he actually did her in. A little over the top, if you ask me. It's messy. Unnecessary. Yeah, but you got to admit, it's not bad for a first-timer. You know, maybe Pops made the right call after all, hunh. [DAN CHUCKLES.] DAN: You're full of surprises. Yeah, well. Chris, this is Dan. Dan, this is Chris. He's our... - How are you, Chris? - ...extra passenger. - Pretty good, and you? - I'm good. CHRIS: Good. Well, let's go for a ride. ["NO WAY OUT" PLAYS] ["NO WAY OUT" FADES OUT] ELIZABETH: Thanks for taking us all over Timbuktu. You didn't have to do that. DAN: Just another day at the office, Darling. Hey. I am so glad to see you. [POLICE CAR SIRENS] How did you know? Is this a setup? [TRUCK DOOR SLAMS SHUT] I see you've met Stark. JOHNNY: What? DAN: Dan Stark, U.S. Marshal. Dan Stark. Sorry for the charade. We thought you're better off on the run. We knew where you were. We knew where you were headed. I came along for the ride to make sure you get there. Gave me a better idea whose side you're on. With us all along, huh. Matt, I've got a job for you. See, we weren't as out in the cold as you thought, huh. Yeah, right. Like you knew. - He's been a challenge. - Yeah. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CAR DOORS SLAM SHUT] JOHNNY: You sure this is a good idea? [TRUCK ENGINE REVS] [BRAKES SQUEAL] [CAR HORN BLOWS] BRIAN: All right. Come on. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [POTS AND PANS CLANG] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you frisk him? Did you frisk him? WAYNE: I think he's clean. Whoa, whoa. Get on him! Fool! Get away. Come on. Come on. Come on. PHIL: Get up! DAN: Ok. PHIL: Get in the chair! DAN: Back up. Nice work, Boys. So Johnny. Who's our new friend here? U.S. Marshal, Dan Stark. PHIL: It's good to have you back, Johnny. What are you doing? Payback, Man. putting my accounting skill to good use, counting sheep. Payback. This how you pay us back after we protected you. JOHNNY: Some protection. What did you expect me to do? - Die. - Oh. Ooh. Scary. Maybe Johnny's learned the error of his ways. We came up with a mutually beneficial way Johnny could prove himself. DAN: How's he going to do so to a maggot like you? PHIL: Whoa! PHIL: Get him up. [DAN THUDS TO FLOOR] By eliminating Anthony's remaining witnesses. I assume you got another video for me. Anthony so enjoyed the first one. Here you go. [LAUGHING] [CLEARING HIS THROAT] VINCE: Hold on, Phil. You feel like proving yourself to all of us here? Sure. Here you go, Johnny. I'm sorry. [GUNSHOT] Clean that up. Good job, Johnny. PHIL: Get the other side, Brian. [ITALIAN MUSIC IN BACKGROUND] JOHNNY: Phil's ego has gotten as big as his gun. FRANK: Don't cross him. We can't lose you again. WAYNE: The cops've really been busting our chops lately. Cleaning us out. You're sure there's no mole? Of course there is. The question is, who? [ITALIAN MUSIC FADES OUT] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Hey. Hey! Where's Vince? I don't know! I don't know where Vince is! Go find him. [PHIL GRUNTS] You've seen Vince? Well, yeah. He's right here. Phil needs him. He got shot. JOHNNY: What? Phil got shot? WAYNE: Shot. JOHNNY: Hey, hey. Phil got shot. Take care of this guy. VINCE: What happened? And Brian? Brian was F.B.I. Aaah. VINCE: I knew we had a mole. But Brian was family! Well, who shot you? Brian. I was driving that Marshal's body to the dumpster. Brian just pulls a gun on me. He said, drive him to the hospital. I guess he thought he could be saved or something. He's an optimist. Who knew. PHIL: Well, we were driving down this side street and I noticed he didn't have his seat belt on, so I gunned it. Slammed into a dumpster. Brian goes flying through the windshield. Good riddance, hunh. CHRIS: Oh yeah. First my family, now me. JOHNNY: God! [GUNSHOTS] [TENSE MUSIC] ANTHONY: Wow. You're quite the auteur, Johnny. Hey, Anthony. JOHNNY: I know where the D.A. is. - Really? - Yeah. - Good. - Oh. Get him off me. JOHNNY: I guess I deserved that. I guess the feds fell for your and Vince's trick. Yeah, they bought it. Good. So, where is she? JOHNNY: She's at the City View apartments on Chipley. But the place is crawling with Marshals. I don't care if she's guarded by a squadron of marines. VINCE: Our source's getting squirrelly. All we've got is Johnny's intel. It's enough for me. Don't roll out the red carpet just yet. Killing some witnesses doesn't erase the fact that he sold me out to save his own skin. He took out that Marshal. Three days ago I'd have killed you. What? Did all that time in prison reform you, Anthony? Being in charge changes how you look at things. I got to respect Pop's final wish. After all, if it wasn't for his death, I'd still be in prison. But it still doesn't change the fact that someone hasn't paid for their disrespect. Yeah. JOHNNY: She will. Relax, Johnny. She will. Vince, I need a word. [JOHNNY LAUGHS] VINCE: I still feel we're rushing things. I don't want to give them time to move her. There's no way Brian got a warning call off. You're the boss. You want her back here alive? Yeah. I want to watch Johnny finish the job he botched. And if he doesn't? I guess I'll have a really big decision on my hands. Which one of them do I kill first. [CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP] [CAR DOORS SLAM SHUT] [SHOTGUN COCKS] [SHOTGUN COCKS] ANTHONY: There you are, Elizabeth. [ANTHONY GRUNTS] [PHONE KEYS BEEP] [ANTHONY HANGS UP] [ANTHONY GRUNTS] [HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] Susan. ELIZABETH: Susan! JOHNNY: That's it. She's in there. [DOOR BURSTS OPEN] ELIZABETH: No. No. It's me. It's okay. [SIGHS] SUSAN: Geez. That's a way to get your head blown off. ELIZABETH: Where were you? CAL: Nobody's here. VINCE: Impossible. What the heck, Johnny? JOHNNY: I don't know. FBI AGENT: F.B.I. Freeze! Don't move. [SHOTGUN COCKS] Put your hands on top of your head. Please give me an excuse. Maybe another day. [SHOTGUNS COCK] What's that? A sting operation I just found out about. Get your stuff. I'm getting you out of here. SUSAN: Move it! [HANDCUFFS CLICK] [DOOR OPENS] Hello Vince. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] How are you, Vince? I'm curious. I really would love to know how that you figured out the identities and locations of the witnesses who were going to testify against Anthony. Are you charging me with something? DAN: 27 felonies, from murder to extortion. VINCE: Only 27? I guess my sources are a little more thorough than yours. Well, I can, be happy to refine the list for you. So, let's see. We had 27, this will be 28, right? Vince? You have something we want. And what is that? How about we take the death penalty off the table. Life in prison, hunh? I'll pass. Before you go play mister negotiator, will you just humor me for a second? How the hell is it that I see a bullet pass right through you, and yet, here you sit? You were treated to a special effects show compliments of the United States Marshal's office. Not bad, hunh. [VINCE CHUCKLES] Looks like I need a better support staff. What's it gonna be? You going to take the deal? I'm going to roll the dice with your defective court system. So, when you get a deal that's worth chewing on... you know where to find me. You're going to regret that. Every moment of that. Because when you're sitting on death row, it's not a happy place. So, who was it? Was it Johnny? Was it Brian? Was it Julian that betrayed us? All of them? You first. ANTHONY: You listen to me. No more excuses. No more lies. You deliver Johnny and that D.A. in the next two hours or you're dead. Period. You understand me? And trust me, it won't be quick or painless. ELIZABETH: What you did was incredibly brave. And though I hate to admit it, and I've completely forgiven you; the thought of me shooting you puts a smile on my face, still. Oh, wow. So, you're thinking of me too, hunh? Oh, so, you do have a sense of humor after all. Okay. Ah, well, you know. It's just one of the many, many, many fine qualities that make me the perfect catch. Oh. Aw, come on. You're still trying to pick me up after all this? You know what they say. There's a thin line between love and hate. - Hunh. - Yeah. But, I think most people start with like and then they move to love and, That's at least before hate and stalking and trying to kill each other. I'm dyslexic. I do everything backwards. ELIZABETH: You do. I mean it can only go up from here, right? SUSAN: Aah, I do believe a "thank you" is in order. Enh. Well, just doing your job. Come on. I've got a surprise for you two. Just a little token of our gratitude. JOHNNY: Cool. ELIZABETH: Okay. DAN: Fifteen years. Got it. Right. [PHONE CLICKS SHUT] [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] What have you got for me now? A generous offer by anyone's standards. Twenty-five years in a fine federal facility. VINCE: Hmm-hmm. Well, they do have good food. Weight room, libraries. But I'd wind up being an old man. [PHONE RINGS] [MUMBLING IN BACKGROUND] PHIL: Sure. Sure. [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] PHIL: Okay. Sure. [PHIL HANGS UP THE PHONE] [PHIL TAPS ON WINDOW] A fine federal facility. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] [RELAXING MUSIC] JOHNNY: In all those years, I never knew Phil was F.B.I. SUSAN: Well, that's what we call being undercover. SUSAN: Surprise! JOHNNY: What is this place? SUSAN: It's a humble little abode we seized from a drug lord a couple of weeks ago. You'll be sequestered here until we get you new identities. JOHNNY: Well, how long? SUSAN: Just a few weeks. - Okay. - Where's our protection? Marshal Stark's coming in with some deputies. ELIZABETH: Do we have to go back into WITSEC? Half the Torinos are either dead or they're locked up. SUSAN: Honey, Anthony is still missing. Even if we were to pick him up and bring him in, he's still going to have a hit on you. Come on. This is the only way. ELIZABETH: Wow. JOHNNY: Ah, it beats a sheep farm. [SUSAN'S PHONE RINGS] SUSAN: Hello. Yeah, we just got here. DAN: Yeah. This ain't my first rodeo, pal. This ain't my first rodeo. [DAN SLAMS PHONE DOWN] DAN: Five years. PHIL: Tssst. No. DAN: Five years. [DOOR OPENS] This has got to be your lucky day. Ten years. Consider that a gift from the U.S. Attorney's Office. One that I'm going to return, unopened. [DAN'S CELL PHONE RINGS] [DAN'S CELL PHONE RINGS] [DAN'S CELL PHONE RINGS] Agent Steen. He's in an interrogation. What? Five years. It doesn't get any better. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] - Phil. - Well, actually, it's Joe. Susan Anderson, she's their mole. She's got Johnny and Elizabeth. Get someone over to China Grove. Call the local authorities. You, son. I'm finished with you. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERS] Geez. JOHNNY: Oh my Gosh. This is nice. - Aw, is this from Susan? - I don't know. [JOHNNY SNICKERS] ELIZABETH: Please, look. Look. Look. Look. We have a pool! JOHNNY: Nice. You sit down. I'm going to crack open that bottle. - So, a sheep farmer, hunh? - Yeah... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Johnny. Your little boyfriend decided to take a nap. Finally got you all to myself, Elizabeth. Hmmph. [JOHNNY YELLS] [SCREEN DOORS CLACK OPEN] [JOHNNY GRUNTS] [ANTHONY GRUNTS] [ELIZABETH SCREAMS] [ANTHONY GRUNTS] [ANTHONY GRUNTS] Help! Johnny! [ELIZABETH SCREAMS] [ANTHONY AND ELIZABETH SCREAM] [ANTHONY GRUNTS AND ELIZABETH SCREAMS] [ANTHONY SCREAMS] [ELIZABETH SCREAMS] MATT: Remember me? Geeky rookie. Yeah, they give us guns too. Sorry I broke your car. Actually not, because you're kind of evil. Put these on. [POLICE CAR SIRENS] Come on. It'll match your shirt. [POLICE RADIOS SOUND OFF] POLICE RADIO: 1 11 1 10. Get her out of here. POLICE RADIO: Roger... Look what we've got now. Another friend. Hi, pal. ANTHONY: That badge make you a man? Hunh. Does it?! - Talk your way out of this one. - I can't get to you! ELIZABETH: Susan. SUSAN: Elizabeth. I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. No. Wait. DAN: She betrayed you. She betrayed you. It was payback to Anthony for taking out her husband. And his lover, the boss's wife. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Joe: How'd you know? MATT: Because he's a Jedi. He told me to follow Susan. I still don't know why. It was the look in her eye. That day in the parking lot. She's looking at her best friend and she's so worried about her best friend. But in her eyes, I saw guilt. I didn't see relief. Let's go. COURT CLERK: All rise. Have you reached a verdict? Yes, Your Honor. On the sole count of the indictment, murder in the first degree, we find the defendant... guilty. JUDGE: It is the decision of this court that Anthony Torino be given a life sentence, without the possibility of parole. [JOYFUL TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC] [GALLERY APPLAUDS] [DOORBELL CHIMES] JOHNNY: Coming. - Ho-ho, Dan. Hey. - How you doing, Johnny? - Good. - I've only got a second. I just came to see how you're doing. - Come on in. - All right. JOHNNY: Making some tea. You want some? Yeah, I love sweet tea. You know that. JOHNNY: Yeah, so, uh. Has everyone been relocated yet, or? Yeah. We just put the last one in place. - How, uh, how you settling in? - Good. Actually, I did want to talk to you about something. Elizabeth. I mean, we haven't seen each other. I mean, can't we e-mail, Skype? Why couldn't we be relocated together? DAN: Be realistic. One of you make one mistake, and you're both dead. That's why we put the rules. - Rules. - I'm sorry. Man. You know what? No one understands us like we understand each other. That month we spent together. It rocked. If it hadn't been for you, many things'd have turned out differently for many people. It's not like I really had a choice. DAN: Oh, you had a choice. And you made the right choice every single time. And if no one else will come in here and tell you, then I will. Thank you. Thank you. I, uh. I'm telling you though, Dan, I don't know if I was the one making all the choices. JOHNNY: There might've been something, sort of, guiding us. Maybe you could call it God. You think you found redemption. Redemption's a beautiful thing. - I've really got to go. - Okay You take care of yourself, Adam. Man, I can't get used to that name. Take care of yourself, too. [DOORBELL CHIMES] Hi. I'm Eve. I'm your new neighbor. Nice to meet you. [JOHNNY LAUGHS] JOHNNY: Oh my God! [SINGING] Love comes walking. Love comes crawling. Redemption of the soul Brings a meaning to it all. Children, say it again, say it again. [TRUCK CRANKS] Children, say it again, Oh, say it again, say it again. Children, say it again. Redemption of the soul Brings a meaning to it all. Children, say it again, Oh, say it again, say it again. Children, say it again.
