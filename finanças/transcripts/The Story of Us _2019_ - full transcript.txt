Hello. It is a beautiful day to sell books, isn't it, Eliot? Yes, I agree. Hey, Alex. What's up? Hey, Jamie. I was trying to figure out a good book to give Taylor for Valentine's Day. She likes romantic comedies, I figure... Mirth is funny, right? Yes, it is. And Edith Wharton, one of the greatest authors of all time. The first woman to win a Pulitzer for literature. But in this case Mirth is ironic. Also romantic, but much funnier, and spoiler alert, a happy ending. Although, if you want her crying on your shoulder about the importance of following your heart when it comes to true love then "House of Mirth" it is. Happy deciding. You are a lifesaver. Well, I hope she likes them. Alright, thank you, Jamie. Of course. Bye. Bye. Hey, Luce. Did you know Lennox Music is closed? What? When? I don't know. I just saw the place is empty and there's a "closed for business" sign on the front door. That is the third business on this block since the beginning of the year. Fourth, if you count Cassidy's Candles in December. What is going on? What? There's my favourite niece. Your parents Skyped me last night from Winnipeg. I swear, they're gonna put 100,000 miles on that RV by the end of the year if they- what is it? When did you get this? This morning. And I checked. Every shop in the business district got one, too. I bet if you check your mail you have one. What do you think this means? I guess we'll find out at the meeting. But if this Ridley is a property development company? No, that can't be good news for any of us. So, as you can see, we turn the Waterford business district into a mixed use space which will drive revenue for the entire town. I like the adjustments. I think the Waterford council will, too. Thank you. Sawyer, how many projects have you done for Ridley? Five? If you pick this one, seven. Seven. Impressive. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. The Waterford project isn't secure yet. It will be, which is where you come in. Me? You're from Waterford. A point you made in your initial presentation. I am. That's gonna help us when it comes to persuading the community. Hold on, Dana, I haven't been back in a very long time and besides I'm just the architect. But you could be more. Here's your opportunity. The Waterford council wants us to present our designs in a couple of days before they take an initial vote next week. We have secured several properties already but their sales are contingent on this project going to the next step. Help Ridley take that next step and we can talk about bringing you in-house on a permanent basis. So no more per project bids? How does that sound to you? That sounds great. Good. Maybe it won't be that bad? The flyer only says they're discussing a project. This happened a few years ago in Tanner Falls. Some developers came in, said they were gonna do some improvements, wiped out all of the stores in the business district and then they built them back up to look like something out of an H.G. Wells novel. And not one of the cool ones. Well, if they do go forward with something like that they at least have to buy you out. But I'd still lose the store. And I've dreamed of owning this place since I worked here in high school. It's the reason that I fell in love with reading and writing and storytelling. I don't want another store, I want True Love. Come on. I know something that's gonna make you feel better. Is that Jason Barnaby? He met Lisa in the travel section last year. I think he's gonna propose. I think you're right. What're we looking at? Rick! What? There's a proposal. Yes. How many proposals does that make? Four since I bought this place. This shop really is a lucky charm for love. Ooh, I'm gonna use that. Which brings me to... Recipe for love? Not all of us are in a romantic time out. Hiatus. My boss, the incurable romantic who owns a romance bookstore while actively avoiding romance. Do you see the irony here? Is this for couples only? No, no, no. All sorts of singles will be there, including yours truly. Yeah, but you're teaching, so you don't count. He counts. Thanks. Cooking class? Just ask her out directly. Well, what if she says no? Then you'll know. Finally. I need to go make some risotto. Oh boy. Eliot, I just fed you. Snuggle time on the couch it is. It's about time you came back. I was scared you'd never show your face again after coming in last in the Fantasy football pool. Remind me next time not to draft a quarterback first. I will do no such thing. It's nice. Thank you for this, man. Really. It's the least I could do. As many times as you've let me stay with you in Portland and Chicago. Don't forget Missoula. How could I forget Missoula? Less than a week, I swear. Hey, it's all good. Enough time for me to, get your opinion on a little situation that I can't quite figure out. Okay. There's a woman... There always is. I'm serious this time. Okay, okay. What's the situation? I can't quite ask her out. What? That is not the Rick I know. No, it's 'cause I like her. I... I really, really like her. We... we had that... that ker-pow moment when we first met... you know the one I'm talking about. I do. And I can't forget it. She liked me, too. I know she did. Why didn't you ask her out then? I was dating Megan. Megan, that disaster. Yeah, thanks for reminding me. Alright, never mind. It just... sorry. Just... you were telling me about...? Lucy. Yeah. But I made the classic mistake of letting too much time pass after we first met and now I'm not sure if she only sees me as a friend... I can't believe the day has arrived that Rick the romancer has met his match. Now, when do I get to meet this nice girl? Tomorrow night. I'm... I'm... I'm doing this Valentine's theme cooking class down at the restaurant and Lucy said she'd come. Do you think that you could- Count me in! Just, you know, obviously don't expect me to cook anything edible. No, no, no, no. I'm the chef. You're the wingman. Yes, chef. Thanks. No problem. Hi. Can I help you find something? You know, actually I was hoping to catch Jamie. Is she here? She is not. Do you know when she'll be back? No, sorry I don't. Look out! Good catch. Sawyer. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks. What? It's Romeo and Juliet. You look like you're up on a balcony. There's no balcony. What? In the story she's standing at a window. Everybody gets it wrong. I'm sorry. I... I'm just completely thrown. Yeah. So was I. I suppose I shouldn't be, this was always your favourite place. Let's start again. Hi, Sawyer. Hey, Jamie. You dropped this. Thank you. I don't remember this courtyard. But you remember the tree, right? The tree was always here. In fact, they actually built the bookstore around it so they wouldn't have to take it down. Yeah, this courtyard was completely overgrown. I talked Mr. Ogilvy into letting me clean it up a few years ago. And we're hoping to expand. Or I should say were hoping to expand. You were? Not anymore? It's a long story. These developers are buying all of the land in the business district and, I mean, you know they're just gonna destroy everything. Destroy? Well, it's not decided yet but they're having a meeting later to see if they're gonna move forward with the project. Isn't that what business developers do, though? They just tear everything down and put up something hideous? It might not be hideous. Well, I'm sure they will not leave my little bookstore unscathed. Wait, you... you bought the bookstore? Yeah. Yeah. I bought it a few years ago. Just like I always said I would. I had no idea. Well, how would you? You've been gone for 15 years. Unless Rick tells you everything. Not that thing. Well, enough about me. How are you? What're you doing back here? I... Excuse me. Hold on. Hey, Dana, could you... could you... could you hold on just a sec? I gotta take this. Of course. Yeah, go. It was great to see you. Good to see you too. Bye. Hey, Dana. Yeah... Bye. It's Jamie Vaughn, right? With True Love Books? And cafe, yes. Eric Duncan. I'm new to the city council in the area. Nice to meet you, councilman. I'm, glad you dropped by to see the designs for the development. - Proposed development. - Proposed development. We're hopeful that it will generate some much-needed interest in the local business community. Well, what about the Fire and Ice Festival? It has drawn a lot of interest to the area and been very popular for the last few years. And I hope it continues to be, but we should, consider all options. Sure. I just have a million questions starting with Councilman? What happens to the existing stores if this project goes through? I'm sorry, could... could you excuse me for a second? Hey, how are you? Yeah. Hi. Just one second, thank you. Jamie. My goodness. Sawyer O'Dell? Hello, Anita. So nothing for 15 years and then I see you twice in one hour? Yeah. Well, I wasn't exactly sure how to approach the subject earlier... Sawyer, are the designs ready to show? Yes, they are cued up. Excellent. Hello. Are you local business owners? Yes, we are. I'm Anita Vaughn from Anita's Flowers and this is my niece... Jamie Vaughn, True Love Books and Cafe. Nice to meet you both. I hope you'll be as excited as we are about the vision we have in mind for the project. Proposed project. Well, I'm confident that Sawyer's designs will help persuade the council's decision to go forward. Ready? Your designs? Yeah. Are you alright? I guess we'll find out. There you go. Enjoy. I knew it. They're wiping out all the stores. Just like Tanner Falls. Really? Yep, and Sawyer is a part of it. I cannot believe he didn't tell me. How long did you two date? Well, we met in the eighth grade but we didn't start dating until sophomore year. Were you prom queen and king? He was king. I was the girl who stayed late in the library focusing on my books and studies. Of course you were. Yeah. And you would think those differences would have driven us apart, especially being so young, but that wasn't until after graduation. What happened? Well, right before he left for college he came to me and he gave me this big speech about how we were way too young to be so serious, especially with him going off to Columbia and me staying at Reed. You know, we had our whole futures to consider. And that was that. We broke up. I'm sorry, honey. It was a long time ago. Have you tried these, by the way? They are amazing. Yeah. Rick's workin' on a new recipe. That reminds me, you're coming with me tonight. Where? Rick's Valentine's cooking class. And no "I'm writing" excuses. I need you there in case I meet someone. That way we can discuss the pros and cons. What about Rick? Yeah, I'll ask Rick's opinion too, you know, guy's perspective. But first I need to meet my own true love. Well, how do you know you haven't already met him? I mean, Waterford isn't exactly Portland in terms of population. No. I will know when I meet him. We will both have that moment where we just know. You know? Okay, this is going somewhere else. No, I don't know. Why didn't you tell me that Jamie bought True Love Books? Remember a few years ago when I casually mentioned she was dating that dentist and your reaction was to tell me to never let you know anything about Jamie because it distracted you? Vaguely. Well, you did. So I didn't. Anything else you're not telling me? She's not happy about the project. Yeah, yeah, I get that already. And she's single. So what... what happened with the dentist? He moved to Texas last year. So they weren't that serious. They were serious. He got some... some job offer that he couldn't turn down, he asked her to move with him, she declined. Why? You'll have to ask her. Given how she reacted when she found out I was working with Ridley that feels highly unlikely. Is she dating anyone now? No one. She's on a romantic hiatus. That does sounds like something she would say. Yeah. Lucy thinks that, instead of dating, Jamie pours all her heart into the bookstore. The very one that you're trying to tear down. Wha...? We have to find a way to fight back. Okay. But how? I have exactly no idea. But we have got to come up with something. I mean, this place just means to much for them to cavalierly tear it down. What is that? It's a book. It's not a book. These are valentines. These are so cute. These are valentines from old True Love customers to True Love Books. This is ridiculously sweet. Look, this one says it's from 1965. Mr. Ogilvy must have kept them. "Dear True Love, without you we wouldn't have had "our first Valentine's Day coffee and found our own true loves. "You'll always have a place in our hearts. "Love, Chris and Cara". "A valentine of appreciation to True Love Books and Cafe. "You brought us together in classics and helped us find "our happily ever after. "Forever grateful, Sam and Lauren". We should put these out for the customers. Yes, and show how important True Love is to the community. That's it. What's it? That's how we fight back. Yes, yes, that's right. Valentine's cards from old True Love customers. People who met there. Yeah, and some of them date back to the middle of last century. Yeah, and this year alone we've had four proposals in the store. Now, isn't that a legacy worth saving? And when is it going to run? Great, thank you so much! We're in! Yes! Of course you're here. This is a small town. Okay, everybody, if you all would find a cooking station. Jamie, would you like to... Yes, I would. Well, okay, thank you. Alright. You look great. Thank you, you do, too. Hi. Do you want to... Sure. - I'm Lucy. - I'm Quentin. I like your sweater. Alright, chef. What is on the menu? We're gonna start off with an arugula salad, marinated figs, cherry tomatoes and feta cheese. Followed by our entree of miso glazed salmon, roasted potatoes, and bok choy. I love glazed salmon. What's for dessert? Raspberry chocolate torte. Yes! What? Nothing. I mean, I just think if a guy wants to say something to a woman like "hey, I like you" or "hey, I'm actively employed by the company trying "to tear down your store" that direct communication goes a lot farther than dancing around the topic or, you know, being vague about it, but you guys do you. Okay, if one partner would head to the back and grab some salad fixings. Got it! I'm sorry I didn't mention my involvement with Ridley when I first saw you at the bookshop. Thank you. But, in my defence, I didn't know it was your bookshop until just then. But you knew it was True Love and you know how much that place means to me. Well, yeah, but not for a long time. No, it wasn't a long time ago to me. And if you think that finding out my ex being a part of team Ridley is gonna stop me from doing what I need to do to save True Love then you have another thing coming. What're you cooking up? Miso glazed salmon. Weren't you paying attention? I was paying attention and you are planning something. Sawyer? What? You wanna give everybody else some arugula? Sorry. "Is romance on your mind? "True Love Books and Cafe in Waterford may be "the place to go. "With dozens of proposals "and successful first dates in its history, "some say the bookstore and cafe is love's lucky charm. "And while we'll never know for sure, "many former customers believe in its romantic magic so much "they've been sending thank you valentines "to the store for decades. "Isn't this the type of Waterford legacy worth saving?" This is wonderful, Jamie. Was the article your idea? I did the interview yesterday. Yeah, I probably should have thought of it before but it didn't occur to me until I found the valentines and with the vote coming up, which did you hear? It got moved up to February 14th. Valentine's Day? So soon. I guess Ridley's putting pressure on them to make a decision. But honestly, this article has generated so much interest in the store. We have people coming in from Portland and Eugene. Lucy called this morning and said there was a line already outside the door. Will it be enough, though? What do you mean? If you stop Ridley Properties this time won't a development team just come in right behind them? I mean, it sure seems like the council has their sights set on wiping this whole area clean and starting over. Actually it's pretty evenly split which means that Eric will have the final say and he is very open to listening. Or he notices a pretty woman is the face of the opposition. It's not like that. Oh, honey. I saw how he looked at you at the cooking class. Sawyer saw, too. Sawyer? What did Sawyer say? He didn't say anything. I mean, after your little spat. It was not a spat. Couples have spats. We had a vigorous disagreement. However you want to put it. The point is Sawyer kept watching both of you during the whole class. Well, there's nothing going on with me and Eric. Especially after... Sawyer? Matt. The guy I was just dating who moved away. But to be fair to Matt he wanted you to go with him. Unlike Sawyer, who just left. Yeah, to go to college. Who's side are you on? Always yours. Which is why I'm so proud of you for that. Thank you. I wonder what the feedback will be like from the Ridley side. Your goal was to persuade the community to embrace our deal. I know. To be very clear this is the opposite of that. I understand, which is why I'm working to meet with as many of the owners as possible. Well, perhaps you should concentrate on Miss Vaughn. Look, I know that Jamie can be a little passionate about her causes... Jamie? How well do you know Miss Vaughn? Well, I haven't seen her since high school. But in high school? We... dated. She was your high school sweetheart? We never referred to ourselves as- Sawyer. Yes. We were high school sweethearts. And now? Now nothing. Well, a friendly nothing. We did just take a cooking class together the other day. That's good, because there can be no lingering animosity between the two of you that could imperil this deal. I got it. I got it under control. I just sent an SOS to Rick, we are almost out of sugar cookies. This is fantastic. That'll teach him. Who? Mr. Arugula? What? Matt? What does your ex want? And speaking of blast from the past... Yeah. Nice article. Thanks. But I have to ask. What did you think of my actual designs? They're... beautiful. And they will fit right in. In Sweden. Sweden? Yeah, like Nordic minimalism, which I am actually a huge fan of, it's just... not Waterford. I should get back to work. Yeah. In my bookstore. 'Cause it's busy. I have to do something to counter Jamie's article. Good luck fighting against True Love. Have you been by there today? It's like a mosh pit. Yeah, it's like every unattached person in town all of a sudden has an interest in the written word, including Quentin. Who's Quentin? Sweater guy from my cooking class. Yeah. Lucy and him exchanged phone numbers and now, according to Lucy who likes to tell me these sorts of things, they're making plans for dinner, which is not the outcome that I was going for. You know, Jamie had a point. You should tell Lucy how you feel. Yeah, maybe I should have told her when she was 100 percent single but now she's not. They've only just talked. She's still 98 percent single. Whatever. What about you and Jamie? There was no effort at subtlety in that conversation pivot. Nope. So? Have you talked to her since your cooking class disaster? Briefly. And meanwhile, only one store in the business district is willing to sit down with me. Olga's Dance Studio. That's the benefit of her having lived here longer than you. Jamie's in mostly everybody's ear. Yeah, but my sort of being from Waterford is one of the reasons why Ridley gave me this shot. If they hire me I won't have to travel so far for every project and I might maybe even eventually be able to buy a house. You need to reintroduce yourself to folks in a friendlier way. Embrace the community. Embrace the community. "Dearest, I know you told me not to write, "but you also told me to not wait for you "while you go fight for our country. "But you see, my darling, it is quite impossible for me "to let you go "and so I will wait for you and give you glimpses of the world "you have here upon your return". They were so in love. Who? Mary and Harris, the original owners of the book store. I found some of their letters in the Story of Us box. Harris broke up with Mary before he was shipped overseas for World War II because he didn't want her waiting for him. But she ignored him and kept writing anyway. Good girl. Yeah. Her letters about what was happening in Waterford is what kept him going while he was away. Nowadays she'd probably send him texts with some emojis mixed in. Yeah. So not the same. Sounds romantic. Which makes sense for a couple who started a bookstore called True Love. I mean, wouldn't that be nice? To have someone who'd want to do something so creative with you like start a bookstore? I thought you were on a romantic hiatus. Doesn't mean I can't recognize romance in other people. Thank you. Wait, what? Does that say Ridley? Don't look now, but I... No way. I love Waterford. My mom and I moved here when I was 12 years old. Chuck, your dad gave me my first job at the pizzeria. I remember. So this isn't just gonna be some random tear-down. I'm a hometown boy who's come back to his roots to do what I can to help make things better for a place that I care a lot about. I'm sorry. Hometown boy? That's me. And when was the last time you were here? Well, it's... it's been a while. Since you graduated high school, right? About that. So... How did you even come up with these designs if you haven't even been here in a decade and a half? Well, I... I don't need to be on location in order to create my designs. Oh, what? Because it's all just the same? Just some stores to be torn down? Not at all. History to be ignored? Beth, how long have you had your hobby warehouse? Thirty-five years. Thirty-five years! Thirty-five years. People have been coming to your store for everything they need from scrapbooking needs to their homemade Christmas decorations. That's right. But because of where your store is located, some people in Portland, think it would make a great place for some retail space-station- like mega development, forcing you to sell your life's work. Is that right? It's not. It is not. It's not a space station. It's not. Hey, Lucy. Let me help you with that. Thank you. Where's Jamie? Jousting with her ex. Sawyer has her going, huh? That and trying to save the store she's loved since childhood, and sunk her life savings into. There. How do I look? The only answer is gorgeous. Oh, aren't you sweet? Why do you ask? Quentin's stopping by. Sweater guy? It's February, Rick. People wear sweaters. You have sweaters. Yeah, but I make 'em look cool. So do you like this Quentin guy? I mean, you get that wow moment that you talk about? I don't know if I'd call it "wow", but he's nice and handsome. But no "wow"? No, I haven't had many of those. Only one, actually. What happened with that guy? Nothing. Absolutely nothing happened with that guy. You two... never went out? Nope. I thought for sure that we would but it never happened. Maybe our timing was just off or... maybe it was all one-sided. So where is he now? Lucy. Hi. Quentin! Hi. For you. That's... thank you. I'm gonna go make some risotto. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. No fair, you already know everyone in Waterford. Thanks, Sawyer! Well, it seems the hometown boy is making progress. Well, you had, what, a 15-year head start on me? Six. Six years. I only came back to Waterford six years ago. Hold on, you didn't come back right after college? Jamie! There you are. Karen. Hello. I never see you anymore. Well, we've been busy. Being busy is the best way to get over heartbreak. That's certainly been Matt's motto this past year. I'm Karen Van Horn. Sawyer O'Dell. Sawyer? Jamie's ex. - From a long... - Long. Time ago. I see. Matt talks about you all the time. He does? Matt? My son. Jamie and Matt dated... A long... Last year. Time ago. A year's not that long ago. And since we're, on the subject of time, Jamie and I have a lunch reservation right now. Yes, we do, right now. It was so good to see you, though. I'm so sorry. Buh-bye. Nice to meet you. I take it she's not your biggest fan? Actually it's the opposite. Yeah, if she had her way Matt and I would be together. What are the chances of that? Considering he's in Texas and I'm here I'm gonna go with none. I think we're safe now. This reminds me of when we skipped algebra in high school. And Coach Taylor caught us. And you miraculously talked our way out of detention. Well, you're not the only one who can be charming you know. I'm well aware of how charming you can be. Believe it or not I was really happy to see you in the bookstore again. Before things got complicated. Complicated. That is one word. I was glad to see you, too. Yeah? It reminded me of how we first met. I don't remember you trying to bean me in the head with Jane Austen when we first met. No, but it was in the same bookstore. Yes. Right where, romance and Sci-Fi genres converge. Right there on the shelf, the book we were both looking for. The Princess Bride. Yeah. You had just arrived in Waterford. Yeah, my fifth town in four years and you were my second friend. Rick will always be first. But you'll always be prettier. Don't tell him that. I would never, it would destroy him. Okay, I gotta confess. I should have said something earlier but... I'm hungry. Me too! I skipped breakfast! Lunch? Lunch. I know just the place. I cannot believe you are eating ice cream in this weather. It's the Sundae Madness. I can't believe they still have it. I think that was your exact order on our very first date. It was. I've missed this so much. I've been to a million other ice cream shops. Nothing compares to Jeff's. I missed it like crazy when I was in Minnesota. When were you in Minnesota? Right after I graduated from Reed. I did an internship at a newspaper in Minneapolis and they made me a full-time reporter. Mostly human interest stories. Did you like it? I did. Yeah, I learned a lot about storytelling that way. But eventually I came to realize just how much I missed this place. So six years ago when I got back, Mr. Ogilvy made me manager of the store and then when he decided to retire I knew I had to buy it. Well, that doesn't surprise me. You living outside of Oregon, however, does. I never thought you would. I know. You said that when you broke up with me all those years ago. We broke up with each other. Did we? I thought we did. No, like you had a very good point. People should go out into the world, see other things, have other experiences, before they decide where they want to settle down. That's what I did and that's how I know. This is where I wanna be. So are you still writing? Here and there. Published anything? Not yet. Have you tried? I haven't. Why not? Probably for the same reason everybody else who writes but doesn't publish. Fear of rejection. Rejection hurts. Duck crossing? Yeah. Yeah, those went in a little while ago. Do you remember Mrs. Montenegro? The woman on Ashland Avenue. Exactly. So turns out she was buying land on the outskirts of town, just little by little, until eventually she got the local preservation society to designate the area a bird sanctuary. Really? Yes, but unforeseen result is we've now had an influx of ducks. - Ducks? - Yeah, ducks. Hundreds of ducks. And they obviously follow the rules of the road? Well... I don't know if they actually... Hey, Sawyer! Dad wants to say hi. I should... Yeah, yeah go ahead. Hey, what's all this? I'm doing a last minute Valentine theme wine tasting down at the restaurant. What made you think of this? Let me guess, Lucy? Yeah, Lucy. I saw her down at the park and we talked. Now I don't know if I'm seeing what I want to see but I feel like... mayb... okay, probably not, but... Rick, you need to tell her how you feel. Okay, so I'm gonna do a wine tasting, create a fun, friendly environment where I can tell her how I feel. You're gonna be there, right? To help me out and make me look good like you did the other day? You don't need me for that. Yeah, they were just shaking hands. Just Sawyer, Chuck, and Chuck's dad, like they were old friends. Or old employer-employee. From an eternity ago. Well, I remember every person I've ever employed. Yeah, well you're good like that. And so is Chuck, and Chuck's dad. Yeah, it's Sawyer I'm mad at. Mad? Okay, I'm frustrated. I'm not mad. He is winning people over right and left and now I think Olga's Dance Studio is gonna back the proposal. Well, it's not just Sawyer's charm. What do you mean? Is that...? A 20 percent increase from their last offer. I'm not gonna accept it. Aunt Anita. No, this is my home, and the store is still my joy. And besides, I'm too young to retire just yet. Yeah, but if you got that that means the others did, too. It's a good offer, Jamie. I could pay off my second mortgage. And aren't we just delaying the inevitable? No. No, the vote on the 14th is to see if the council even recommends going forward with the project. We stop it there and it's done. We all stick together and we say no we can actually sway the council's vote. I know councilwoman Baker's in favour of it going forward, and her husband owns Golf Mart over on 3rd Street. Now that's a big chunk of land. Yeah, but all of us together is even more land. More property, more voice. How many of you all remember what happened at Tanner Falls? I mean, some of those store owners didn't even have a place to go back to or a place they could even recognize. We all want what's best for Waterford and we understand the importance of bringing in new people to the district, it's why we started the Fire and Ice Festival. Look, you all know how much I love my bookstore. I mean, even before it was mine. But I believe all of you love your stores just as much. I've been at the same dance studio for over 20 years. I don't know where I'd be without it. Right. And if we are all one voice at that council vote maybe you won't have to, Olga. What's on your mind, Chuck? Well... Chuck Blevins from the pizza place sent in his agreement this morning. Well, that's good news. He liked the idea of one of his dad's old employees being in charge of the redesign. Good job. How's it going with the bookstore? Jamie and I are talking. About her supporting the project? It's a work in progress. As long as there is progress before the council vote. There's a reason Ridley chose you for this. I remember. Eliot! Oh, Eliot. What'll we do if we can't save this place, huh? Okay, there you go, bud. There you go, bud. "Darling Mary, words alone cannot express "how grateful I am that you did not listen "when I told you not to write. "Each story you relay to me of the people back in Waterford "reminds me anew what it is I'm fighting for. "It's love. "Though we have been apart for what feels like ages, "my love for you remains ever steadfast, ever true. "Please keep the stories comin, my dear. "Your words inspire me and bring me hope. "Love, Harris". So we're gonna keep half the copies of these letters here, take the other half to the Fire and Ice Festival. Bring people from there to here. And here to there. So they can read what happens next. Exactly. Yeah, I want these letters to inspire people and help them reconnect with the town's history. Maybe then they'll be less eager to tear it down. What're you thinking? I'm thinking... can you watch the store for a little while? Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for meeting me. This used to be your favourite building in Waterford. You drew it all the time. I did it in watercolours, too. Always reminded me of someplace grand. Well, it originally was a church. And now it has been re-purposed to be a town hall and a theatre. You know, you say you're a hometown boy but did you actually miss your home town while you were away? Honestly? I've been too busy with work or looking for the next project to do much of anything else. Then let me remind you what you left behind. They wrote each other throughout his time away in the war and then when he got back they bought True Love Books. Her father originally owned this building but Harris loved books so much he got the entire property and the rest is... History. This is such a special place. The store, the courtyard, the tree. I've always thought so. And then to find these valentines from old customers, I mean, people who went out, picked out a card, and wrote in their appreciation for True Love Books? It just... it makes it that much more special. You can take that if you want, I can... No, no. Were you ever tempted to go to Texas with Matt, start some place new? A little. But I couldn't tell if it was because of how I felt for him or if I was just... Lonely? Reliving not going to Columbia with you way back when. Do you wish you had? Do you wish you had stayed? Don't answer that. Really? I mean, you didn't stay and I didn't go and because of those decisions we are who we are today. Well, for what it's worth I think you turned out pretty well. Yeah? Jury's still out on you. Yeah. Now's your shot. Be cool. Yeah. Alright. Here we go. Hey, Luce. Hi. You said you liked that Chardonnay last time you were here. Unoaked. You remember. Yeah, I remember all sorts of things, like, the first time that we met. August 9th, two years ago. You'd only been in town for a week and you walked in here wearing a, purple paisley shirt, ordered a salmon miso, unoaked Chardonnay. And I remember you were hilarious and dating Megan the model. Yeah, we broke up. Yeah. Ten months later. Sorry! Sorry. Consults ran late. Of course. Hi, Rick. I gotta go... Make some risotto. Pour some wine. So... I'm having that and it's delicious. Maybe you shouldn't arrange any more Valentine's gatherings. No, not at all. What if we sent Lucy a valentine from Rick telling her how he feels? And invade his privacy? Fine, fine, fine. No scheming, we'll just let him continue to pine for her while gently encouraging him to reveal his feelings. Well, it is the mature course of action. Heading home? Fire and Ice Festival starts tomorrow so this hometown girl's gotta go get ready. Well, so does this hometown boy. Mind a little company on the walk? Not at all. Alright. So we've talked about my past and Rick and Lucy but I couldn't help but notice we haven't talked about your love life. That's because there's not much to talk about. So no one? There was a woman, Sarah. We came close. Close as in...? I thought about proposing. Yeah, well that was about the same time she met the guy that was everything she ever wanted. And she said it made her realize that, in her own words, we were just kinda going through the motions. - Was she right? - Yeah. Yeah. I recognized it even as she was telling me. I thought about proposing just because it was a time in my life where I thought I should. And Sarah was, or is I should say, a wonderful person but we were only ever just playing at being a couple instead of really connecting like we should. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, it hurt my ego not my heart. I know the difference. - You live in your parent's house? - Yep. I bought it six months ago, right before they left on their big retirement trip across the continent. Yeah, Frank and Elaine always talked about wanting to do that. Yep, and they did it. Yeah, I just, I couldn't stand the thought of letting this place go. I'm glad you didn't. I always loved this place. Whenever I think about having a home of my own it looks like this. You don't have a house? A condo, but I'm not there that much. I thought a big house was something you always wanted. Part of being freelance is having to take jobs all over the country wherever they are. One of the draws to Ridley is a chance to stay in one place. How many times have I walked you to this door? Jamie! Matt? Matt, what're... I've been trying to reach you to let you know I was coming. Sorry. Matt Van Horn, this is Sawyer O'Dell. The Sawyer. I'm sure there are others out there. Right? Thanks, I'm good. And thank you for walking me home. Yeah. Hi. Do you wanna come in? That'd be great. Okay. Thanks. So what're you doing here, Matt? You always were direct. It saves time. Which I don't have a lot of right now. There's a lot going on. I read your article in the paper about the bookstore. You did? The second I saw your face in the photo... I just got hit with the biggest wave of regret. I miss you, Jamie. Just... all of a sudden? It's always been a struggle. Are they tearing down the bookstore? I don't know. I hope not. If it were to close, would you be open to moving back to Texas with me? You could come to Austin. You could start your own bookstore there. Matt. We had something, Jamie. I let that get away once. I'd be a fool not to try again. Would you think about it? Harris for you, I'll take your Mary. Thank you. Hi. Harris for your Mary. Thanks. Hello. That must have been tough, him showing you up like that. Or are we still pretending that your feelings for Jamie are platonic? No, no, she's still my ker-pow. And are you gonna tell her that directly? Throwing my own words back at me, I see. It's really satisfying. Rick, we are two smart and talented- Yeah! Successful men! You forgot handsome. Why can't we figure this out? We've figured it out. We just need to act on it. For a woman on a romantic hiatus you have a lot of guy issues. I know. I mean Lucy, it was like one of those fantasies where the ex shows up, like, grovelling because they made such a huge mistake. I know that fantasy. Right? And Matt is such a good guy. And you know, for so long I wondered if I should have just gone with him but my life is here. Although even that's up in the air now. What about Sawyer? Was he super jealous when Matt swooped in? I was too numb to tell. Just distract me with Quentin talk, please. There is no more Quentin. Already? No spark. I hoped, but... What was that? What was what? That look at Rick. A look at Rick. Do you like him? And don't say "yeah, he's my friend" 'cause you know what I mean. I have liked Rick since the first moment I saw him. Quentin could not compare. You cannot say anything. - But I wanna... - But I... But I want to. I said no. Hello. A customer. Hello. Have you read the story of Harris... Sawyer. Excuse me. Sure. Hey. Yeah? We have to do something. About Matt, I think we should just- Lucy. Lucy? Lucy. Lucy likes Rick. I'm gonna go tell him. No! No, you absolutely cannot tell him. I made a promise and that would be a violation of trust. So what do we do? Well, we have to get them together. I thought we weren't scheming. Well, that was before I knew the feelings were mutual. I'm just gonna nod like that makes sense. Valentine's Day is in two days. This whole festival is about, music and romance and love and food- Food! Food. Food! Hey! No spying. They're right out in the open. Rick would totally spy. Okay, a little bit of spying, come on. Hey, Jamie says you need help handing out samples? She did? Don't you? Right. Wait, wait, wait. Yes. Help. Here. So I know what I'm serving. You really do make great risotto. I've I've had some practice lately. How long is lately? August 9th. Two years ago. Please tell me Quentin's not gonna show up all of a sud... He's not. Why not? Because he's not my "wow". Ker-pow? It's what I call it. I called it when I first saw you. I need to clear up a few things. Matt? And the council vote is in a couple of days and I don't know what my life is going to look like and I just don't know if right now is the right time... How... how... how about this? I take you to a pre-Valentine's dinner tomorrow and we see where it goes from there? Okay. Tomorrow it is. I'll see you at True Love. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. I am so happy for you! And so relieved that I don't have to listen to Rick go on and on and on about how amazing you are. Oh, no. You are so going to have to hear about that. And don't think I'm not gonna ask you a million questions about how much you knew the whole time?! But not now because Rick's taking me to dinner. Well go get ready! I will pack up. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you for coming. Thanks for calling so soon. Have you thought about what I asked? I have. It's been, buzzing in my head since I saw you. But it's a no. Matt, I know there's a part of me that could talk myself into getting back together with you but it wouldn't be right. I'm sorry, Matt. Goodbye, Jamie. Bye. Miss Sutton? Hello, Miss Vaughn. Well, this is a surprise. What brings you in? I thought I would stop by on my way to the festival. I have to say, Miss Vaughn, generating that article was a deft move. And the love letters are popular, as well. Thank you. But by now you must realize it's a losing battle. Oh, no. Not at all. I mean, look around. Yes, you're quite busy. But yours is only one store. That's bringing a lot of foot traffic into the district. For now. But what about after Valentine's Day, when the lure of love goes away? The lure of love never goes away. I suppose not. But the emphasis brought on by this holiday will. Valentine's Day is one of the best days of the year and you don't have to be in a relationship to enjoy it. But in the end, Waterford's council is going to vote to go forward with Ridley Property and Sawyer's redesign. He's already persuaded three more stores to support the plan, including Keg and Bikes, which puts us at a tipping point. Persuade. Right. I almost forgot that's why he's here. Well, that's not the real issue. What is? Your future. If... when the council decides to go ahead with the vote and if you remain a hold-out, they could evoke eminent domain and take your property for the benefit of the community, which means they'll likely pay a far lower price than what we are offering now. You have a window of opportunity, Miss Vaughn, but it's shrinking. This is our final offer. Your store is lovely. I can see why you're fighting for it. Perhaps you could use the money from the sale to recreate it elsewhere. It wouldn't be the same. I know. And I truly am sorry. What's wrong? Your boss, Dana Sutton, was just here. Did she say something? Nothing I didn't already know. It was just a timely reminder. Of? Of why you're really here. To be your charming self and persuade everyone to sell. Persuade me to sell. Jamie... You know, I can't help but wonder. Have you just been humouring me this whole time? Or did you ever actually give Waterford a chance? My being here is all about giving Waterford a chance. To... to... to help it thrive again the way I remember it used to. I know you think I exaggerate my memories about this place to score points but it's not true. Waterford is where the best parts of my growing up took place. Where my best friends are. Where I... fell in love. In the past. Past is prologue, Jamie. I know I left when we were kids but I am back now and I can't stop thinking about you. See? I don't know what's real and what's you just doing what you need to do to get the job so you can walk away. Again. I didn't walk away. We agreed. No, you made that decision for both of us. I never saw it like that. You know what? Past isn't prologue. It's past. Just like True Love will be soon. And maybe that's where we should stay, too. Jamie... No, it's okay. I'm not even mad. You're doing what you need to do and I respect that. But I am gonna pass on dinner tonight. It was good to see you again. "My darling Mary, "even though we are separated by countless miles "and an ocean of worry "I still feel your presence deep in my heart "where I have kept you since the moment we met. "As long as you continue to believe in me, "believe in us, I know we can overcome any obstacle "no matter how great. "Because that is the nature of true love. "It always finds a way. Always". There is a tree in the courtyard of True Love Bookstore and Cafe. Okay. The original builders crafted the entire store around that tree. Yeah, and probably chopped down a bunch of others in the process. We don't know that for certain, but what we do know is that they went to extraordinary lengths to keep that tree alive and thriving. Where are you going with this? I have an idea for the Waterford redesign. I know, I've seen it. No, no, a new idea. I knew it. I could feel Sawyer slipping back into my heart and I should have stopped it immediately. No, you shouldn't have. Never stop love. Just because you love someone and it doesn't work out doesn't mean there isn't value in the experience. I mean, even the dentist. - Matt. - Matt. I mean, you learned something from him, didn't you? Yeah, but I don't wanna look back. At least not with Matt. But is that all there was between me and Sawyer? The past? I see how you two look at each other now and there is no doubt about how you feel. And I think it's always been there. That's how it is with true loves. But... here I am about to lose this bookstore that I practically grew up in, where he and I met, where I have put my heart and soul, all for a project that he's a part of? How can that be true love? True love doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be true. Whenever you're ready. Thank you. Council members, I'm Dana Sutton. With me is Sawyer O'Dell, and together we represent Ridley Property Development which, as you know, has presented a proposal for a redesign of the Waterford business district. We are here today to withdraw that proposal and we'd like to present a new one if council is amenable. You realize this will mean we'll have to delay the vote until everyone has the chance to review the designs in depth? We do. And honestly, my business instincts are completely against this but my creative instinct says that what Sawyer came up with deserves to be seen. Well, then let's see it. Everybody wants the Waterford business district to succeed. The question is which direction do we take in order to achieve that goal? If we choose only to preserve the history then we risk failing to revitalize the district and losing out on the opportunity to bring new business to Waterford. If we just wipe the slate clean we lose the charm and history of what makes Waterford the kind of place that we like to call home. After being here for the first time in a long time and several conversations with the very persuasive Miss Jamie Vaughn I started thinking about a new route. True love. Look, they saved the tree, the courtyard. I believe this design will help foster a sense of Waterford's history and community while respecting the past, honouring the present, and planning for the future. Thank you, Mr. O'Dell. Now- Can I say something? Please, Miss Vaughn. Hi. As most of you know I have been leading the opposition to the redesign. To me there is magic in the history of this place. In the Story of Us. However, that doesn't mean that we have to sacrifice our future and after looking at Mr. O'Dell's new designs I believe he's found a way to bridge that divide, for which I am profoundly grateful. So, for what it's worth, the redesign by Ridley has my full support. Clearly, your support is worth a great deal, Miss Vaughn. Now, if there are no objections, we would like to table the discussion until next week, but just for me, I agree with Miss Vaughn. I like it. Sawyer? Congratulations. I feel confident that we will be welcoming you to Ridley Property very soon. Thank you, Dana, and thank you for everything, especially all the support tonight. But... But? You said that one of the things you like about my work is my ability to anticipate a client's needs. Which you just demonstrated. But I think that it's time for me to listen to my own needs, and I need to make a home, a real home, and I would like it to be in Waterford. And you think that prevents you from working at Ridley? Doesn't it? Sawyer, you just pulled off a tremendous success that goes far beyond your talent for architecture. I'm not letting you go that easily. You want to be in Waterford, fine. You have to be here while the project goes forward, anyway. Afterward, we'll negotiate. And I anticipate that it will go very well for both of us. Where's Jamie? She's not here. Okay, where is she? She told me to give you this. What's this? It's a red envelope on Valentine's Day. It's a valentine. Have fun. So I started writing something new. A love story. And I would like your opinion on it. What's it about? Well, a boy and a girl meet, fall in love, then they get separated only to have circumstance bring them back together again. And they realize they never stopped loving each other the entire time. And that's how you know it's true love. That's my favourite kind of story. Mine too. But I'm gonna need your help to finish it. And you will have it. Always.
