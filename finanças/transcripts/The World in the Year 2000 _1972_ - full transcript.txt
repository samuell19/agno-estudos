Welcome, Cherif Sorry for being late, professor The traffic was horrible And with every year, the traffic will get more crowded Eventually leading to the explosion Coffee? No thanks, I drank at home When are you travelling for the confrence? Perhaps next year Is there a chance you might be able to help me? It would be an honor Cherif I requested your presence to tell you about a secret I never told anyone For the past two years I've been working on a solution By the end of the Twentieth century, that's around thirty years from now Most probably you will be still alive And you shall witness the exponential growth in world populace Precisely what the last UN report inferred For example A stand alone city like Cairo will be populated by fifteen million people India, currently at six hundred million will reach eighteen hundred million There will come a time when an individual won't find a solitary place to sleep in Famines will occur and people will cannibalize each other The solution is people getting smaller - getting smaller? - Indeed People must become smaller quarter to one-fifth of their natural size All people present, and the yet unborn Henceforth the individual's needs decrease proportionally The idea initially sounds weird Are you saying it sounds funny to you? But if we to imagine all people having the same size With the tallest person's height around seventy centimetres So we will be midgets? You're saying that because we are relatively tall to them Yes, professor this would be considered a miracle So, you're not convinced? No, I just mean.. You can't get it around your head! Who would've predicted science determining fetal gender? Artificial insemination Fetal development with laboratory equipment Heart transplantation, going to the moon.. People must become smaller! I'm working day and night I don't know when I'll finish I'm sixty seven years old That's why I called you I'll tell you each and every conclusion I've reached and If I die you will finish my quest Do you agree to this, Cherif? At your service After a long and prosperous life Get up, I want to show you something Professor Raif! Cherif, Cherif! Cherif are you alright? What are you doing to yourself?! This is the fourth time an explosion happens and you don't seem to care But my heart falls to my knees First off, you might die and this would sadden me deeply Secondly Where would I find the money to set a funeral to your highness? Third, seems like you're immune to death and always looking a handout.. Gimme some, Shawki! Where am I supposed to get you money from? That's how it is? Goading me for a handful of cash? Get some sesne in your head and stop this act Being a university professor isn't a satisfactory job? Get back to your university and work on yur future My future Your future And that of the entire world - is right here.. - Here? and who told you people want to be smaller? when someone is cursing - they wish the person they hate becomes a midget - that will be the case for all of us All of us! don't include all of us I'm not going to pay money for this result Shawki You gave me your word I take it back I've withdrawn - Really? - Yes! No, Shawki You're an educated and reasonable man The future of humanity.. What's my concern with humanity? This is our modern tragedy Ofcourse What does it matter to you a fool like me living in austerity to buy you rats? I'm not buying anymore rats Have a look at yourself Mister academy acting professional So because you graduated from an acting academy and never had a proper chance and the little money you make from petty roles isn't enough for a decent living So the breadcrumbs you have for sustenance are shared with four or five others but when my experiment succeeds you will have that bread all for yourself Will I be able to act with this size? Everything will be this size We will write, act, build and prosper but on a miniscule scale.. God, have mercy.. It's all because of this profesor Raif I'm sorry I want white rats No white rats Have some mercy One rat's for five lires One rat trap for half a lire can catch you fifty rats a day They must be white rats Alright - Thanks - You're welcome You better not have taken the cash in the piggy bank What is this..?
