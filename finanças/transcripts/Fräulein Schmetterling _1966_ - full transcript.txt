THIS FILM WAS SHOT FROM AUG. 20 TO DEC. 8, 1965. AFTER THE 11TH PLENUM OF THE SED PARTY IN DEC. 1965, THE FOOTAGE WAS REVIEWED FOR "POLITICAL-IDEOLOGICAL ERRORS," AND THE FINAL PRODUCTION WAS PROHIBITED. UNEDITED NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES WERE STORED IN THE GDR'S STATE FILM ARCHIVE. THE 2019-20 RECONSTRUCTION ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A VERSION LIKE WHAT DIRECTOR KURT BARTHEL ORIGINALLY INTENDED. A NEW EDITED VERSION WAS ALSO CREATED BASED ON THE SCRIPT AND THE EXISTING MUSICAL MOTIFS. MISSING DIALOGUES WERE DUBBED, AND THE SOUND NEWLY MIXED. And now, I'll sing you a song. May I? Do you know what it looks like? Like a butterfly. Young people are getting crazier and crazier! Indeed. MISS BUTTERFLY That's impossible! CLOSED DUE TO A DEATH! DIRECTOR KURT BARTHEL Here, pay attention! Come on. TOBACCO SHOP OSKAR RAUPE It's quite cozy here. You can rely on me completely! Oskar's savings book. Your father was always a hardworking man. Why did he have to go into the tobacco business? If only you were older, Helene. Just like your father to leave me with everything to do! My ring turns on my finger and makes the witch vanish forever. I'll take a look around the place. It's lovely of you to take care of the orphans. So things will all fall into place. Please, come in. I can't take them in. It's very cramped. You're already 18, Miss. No matter, sooner or later everyone turns 18. So, Miss, how do you see your future? Miss? -What will we do with you? -I don't know. Sure, I've got something for you. You can start Monday. You'll get the hang of it. What did you sell? Cigars? Oh dear! The most important thing here is to roll up your sleeves. May I help you? I would like this piece of halibut fillet. Wait until the scale stops. 3 marks 50, Ma'am. So, Miss, catch me a nice carp. The girl's new. Not now, when the rush begins! Thank you. Who wanted the carp? -3 marks 50, please. -Alright. You can unpack the kipper boxes over there. You've got some help there. You know, young people these days have two left hands. Now we're closing our eyes. . We close our eyes. Armin, close your eyes! Now we scratch three times with our foot. One, two, three. I see. . I see. . My big sister, Helene! You can open your eyes. -Careful. -What's in there? I got this one. It's just for us. -You're leaving? -For a few days. I have to look after things in Potsdam. -You have a nice job now! -Yes. Sweetie. I'd get rid of the bird. Psittacosis is a. . -Keep hold of your money. -I will. -And keep everything nice and tidy. -Yes. You owe that to your father. I won't abandon you. Well? Watch! What may I offer you, Ladies? We have blood-fresh goods from the middle of the North Sea. I can offer you cod and very fresh halibut. And we also have live fish from our own waters. Please give me one of the carps. It looks delicious. With pleasure! A hefty three-pounder? -Eww! -Oh, sorry, sorry. Here you go, my apologies. That will be 9 marks 60. Great, Helene! Dad couldn't kill animals either. You can't take it back. Sure we can! We're almost there. -Like this? -Could you hold this, please? -Now it can swim. -Yes! Let me have half of the fillet. Exactly two pounds. One too many. I'll take it. What kind of fish is that? Knuckle down! Where are the eels? Would be nice if I could get two. Don't push, I want my turn too! I've been standing here for three hours! Jeez! I want one too. Gosh, this takes forever! I have to get back to work! 3. 50. We've all been in line for an hour. This won't do, my girl! It'll affect my award! you're too fine for fish. Well, Miss. What are we going to do with you? I must earn money. Fine mechanics, fine soaps, fine glassware, fine smithery. . How did this get in here? Excuse me. Footwear: nothing available. Produce: not fine enough. Young people demand only the purest communism. Ah, here's something! FF: the finest of fine. Location: Karl Marx Avenue. It's renowned, A career for you. -Don't walk away from this too. -Certainly not. I won't have anything fine for you again. Yes, Mr. Himmelblau. Well, I have a big heart for young people. lingerie. I'm supposed to apply here. Would you walk a few steps, Miss? That way. You don't have any prior training, huh? I sold fish at the market hall. Carmen, we need a nice coat for this girl. Well, come on. Carmen will take care of you. May I help you? -A pink full-slip in size 40. -Yes. We carry only imports. Slips start at 70 marks. I see. -I think I found the right one now. -Yes, very good. May I help you? A beautiful set! How much does it cost, Miss? Did I do it right? No, you mustn't ask for the price right away. Have you decided? Very nice! You've made a good choice. I think you can take this, Ma'am. Have we found something fitting for the lady, Helene? But of course, you may wear it. No, it's not cheap at all. Take this salmon-colored one. Your husband will be pleased, believe me. It subtly emphasizes the figure. I wear it too. You can really work in a very fine store. These panties will definitely suit you. Really, I can picture it! Really, Helene! The fabric is smooth on the skin. My sincere apologies. Go on. And this half-slip goes with it, of course. A beautiful ensemble, don't you think? Helene! I think you realize that you don't fit in here. -Yes. -Now you're being impertinent! Yes? What did I do wrong? Everything. Step right up and try your luck. That's disgusting. Hey, you want a shower? Hey! Close your eyes, turn your ring and repeat after me. Little ring. . Little ring, round and round you go to open our door. -Asta, what are you doing? -Are you done working already? Renovations. You're up to something fishy, Missy! -The new store? -They're making it even fancier. Guess what I have here? For Auntie. What does it say? -You can expect my visit. . -Who? Friday? That's today. Our Auntie. Now we need her, she's not here! We have to think up something. Let's go! CITY COUNCIL YOUTH WELFARE Don't I look much too young? I'll go get Marion. Wait, take a look! Here, what about this one? Better make a good impression on youth welfare services. Keep your cards close to your chest. Short is in fashion now. You can afford it. What's important is the face. And don't let them look behind your pupils. Does it suit me? Do you really need to ask? You look five years older with it. -I don't know. -But I do. He's coming! Don't anger the uncle. Administrators are always right. May I offer you a cup of coffee? You must be Helene Raupe. My name is Fertig. I would like to talk to your guardian, Mrs. . Of course, our aunt. She helps us wherever she can. We don't really need her, though. She isn't here right now. She's out shopping. She'll be back any moment. Where do you work now? At Exquisite. Bras and such. It's such a fine store. It's not for people like us. Can you afford to shop there? -So it's a lie! -Why a lie? And I thought I'd find things in order. So you lost your job, right? Do you always dress up like this? You probably go out a lot at night, huh? You're really mean. Listen up, kids. You need order and a collective. And you must contribute, like all girls. Find a role model. There's one in the newspaper every day. I'll get in touch with your aunt. You'll hear from me. Keep everything in order. You owe it to your father. Goodbye, children. Everything should be different. -Like how? -Much nicer. -You mean easier. -No, nicer. -There should be these machines. -Machines? Little things for adults to put in their pockets. When you turn them on, you can see immediately whether a child is good or bad. Then what? You can see if you have to scold them or not. So it's mind-reading? Oh, no! The machine just has to tell you good or bad. What if a child is only a little bad and mostly good? Then the machine says good. And if it's more bad than good? Then it says good, too. Why? Because everyone would rather be good than bad. Everybody knows that. But shouldn't you scold someone if they do something evil? Evil scolds itself, haven't you noticed? -Tomorrow we'll do something nice. -Like what? I'll ask Marion. -Ring's free for round one! -Good luck, my boy. What's this about? Come on, give it to him! -The guy's good, huh? -Kalle is our top boxer. Let's go. We're waiting. Don't let him get too close! That wasn't a fight! -Higher! -What was that! Ridiculous! -Thank you. -It was a fair fight. THE BVG IS LOOKING FOR CONDUCTORS Please stand back, we're moving. -May I help you? -One transfer, please. One transfer for the lady. Here you go. Yes? Miss Conductor, is this the right line to Prenzlauer Berg? Certainly, Grandpa. It's the third stop. -Is this the 64? -Yes, come this way. That's the right job for you, Helene. Come. The young man will make room for you. Strange. When I earned my first money, it wasn't half of that. And today? It's still not enough. Have I shown you my boys? That's one offspring. Here. . The second oldest is still in school. Paule works. He has an A- average. Unbelievable! Well, -off we go. -Yes. Let's go home. Good day. Were you at our place? PLEASE VACATE YOUR APARTMENT BY THE 15TH EVICTION NOTICE 3RD WARNING FOR THE FURTHER CONSTRUCTION OF OUR CAPITAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING There you are! This is for you. That's beautiful! It's for me? Asta, go to bed now. Come on, quickly. Silly! Helene, Marion has a new boyfriend again. He has no motorcycle, but a fancy portable radio. Marion doesn't know what love is. In real love, you only have one? Of course. And how do you know if someone loves you? I mean, a man. He looks at you, and you sense it very clearly. Just by looking? The rest just happens naturally. You can tell if he's serious by looking at his eyes. If he's serious. . ? That's getting married and having children, like the Schmittens. -Love is much more than marriage. -Is love kissing? -Well. . -That's all? It's much more. But love is also kissing. But what if he doesn't look at you, and you love him? That's bad, very bad. Helene? Yes? What's fondling? Today at the door, Marion told her boyfriend she won't let him fondle her right away. That's when you love each other very much. Then she can definitely let him. And thus, the female egg is fertilized by the male sperm cell. But as I said, there's still no reliable means of preventing conception. In our conversation about sexuality and love, I have tried to acquaint you with some important questions about intercourse between the sexes. Only if we're familiar with our bodies can we solve this problem for the benefit of our socialist society. We thank our friend Dr. Hirsch for his professional and informed lecture. I invite the young comrades to take the floor for discussion and, of course, also our female comrades. What, no questions? It can't all be clear! Do you need to do this to be a conductor? I wouldn't have thought so. Hey. The left one? Left hand out, the right one just behind it. Imagine: it would knock the legs out from under him. Man, Kalle, you're the best. -Well, with all that training. -And that punch. -Sorry. -Something fell down. -Can't you pay attention? -Don't worry, I'll pay for it. Thank you. -Shall we have a go? -Yes, gladly! Well, what's it going to be? Hey! She's not bad! No! No! Ah, I forgot to pay. Hey, Miss! Come here. -Pleased to meet you. -Likewise. -One ticket. -Gladly, that'll be 20 pfennigs. Yes, right away. Sadly, I only have one mark. -Ah, I have exact change. -Come on. That's ten. And another ten. -Yes, thank you, Sir. -Thank you very much. Anyone who isn't drunk can't have a say whatsoever. Hello. Early shift. It's almost like nightshift for a soldier. Or midnight mass for the Catholics. If he gets to be too much, just say something. I wish you a wonderful day! Anyone without a ticket? It's your lucky day again! You can even ride the bus for free. The fare, please. Are you going to rob your groom, Miss? It's true. Are you going to pay or not? Then get off the bus at the next stop. Are you going to kick us out? Excuse me. They're paying them all for nothing. All the stuff you've already bought. I don't know what youth services want. You bought a new clock to be on time for work, -and then. . -I can't be a conductor. Why not? The few years before you get married. . There are worse things for a woman than being a conductor, Helene. Or do you want your little sister to go into foster care? A frog on the cake. Oh, my god. What's that? Well, they're demolishing the house next door. Dear me, it's a quarter to eight! It's high time! -But the cake is good, huh? -Yes. I can leave without worrying, right? You'll both be reasonable. -Now that you're of age, Helene. -Auntie. . I'll look after you regularly. I've also written that to youth services. Be good. Oh, I have something for you! -Is the hat gone? -Yes, it is! One, two, one, two. . Look, this one is pretty. We'll take this one. You're cute. Hey, come on. It's okay. You're doing great. But she doesn't make a bad impression. But she willfully left her job for the third time. Yet, the uniform looked so good on her! -You'll take the little one. -My place is very cramped. Rather cramped than morally compromised. She must be removed from her sister's influence. But she doesn't make a bad impression. Let's not argue over pedagogical facts. -Here, this is for you. -Well, come on in, kids. Now, children. . Just let the kitten be and sit down, please. We've decided to fundamentally change your lives. Helene, you're going back to your job. You can prove yourself there. a traffic controller. And you'll stay with your aunt in Potsdam. But her place is very cramped. Isn't your aunt nice to you? She is. -If I may interject. . -I thought we agreed, Mrs. Raupe. We'll find a foster home for Asta, and for Helene I'll try to find an apartment. Don't be afraid. That's what I'm here for. I'll take care of you. So don't disappoint me. I trust you. How can you find the sun as a bus conductor? The sun? It's not dark in the bus. Or do you work the nightshift too often? That could be changed. The clown searched for it, but he kept losing it. You see? Just like him! But he isn't serious. Everything has a purpose, even art. Or does he urge our citizens to put the sun in their pockets? No. Or does everyone have their own special sun? Yes. The meaning of life is found in decent work. Don't you all have a sense of innovation, of competition? -Well, yes. . -There you go. If I'd had it as good as you at your age. . Good day, Mr. Kubinke. I'm back. Well? How many times will you make me drive alone? It won't happen again, Mr. Kubinke. There's nothing that won't happen again. I'll be driving off. Ah, it's difficult with girls. With my boys, I make short work of them. Well, let's get going. Even if it's hard. What do you think of the sun, Mr. Kubinke? I don't mean the sun in the sky. Oh, I see. You mean the sun in the heart? Onions in the belly are even better. How long have you been driving a bus? -30 years, not counting the war. -Terrible. Yes, you shouldn't do it for 30 years. Don't you get fed up with it? You get used to it. Don't you think you should always be able to look forward to something new? Sure. Today, for instance. We're having pineapple punch. My oldest is coming with his bride. I'm looking forward to that. Well, I mean. . Yeah, yeah, let it be, Miss. Raupe. Once you've got a husband, little children. . I'll visit you soon. -Bye! -See you soon! Is someone here? It's you! How wonderful! -I can always cook your dinner now. -That would be nice, but Auntie. . They wrote I'm going into foster care. And what do we say to Mrs. Fertig? I'll draw her another picture of Potsdam. But you have to go to school! I brought all my books. I just can't show my face outside anymore. Now it's time for math. Miss Raupe, please explain this problem again. I still don't understand it. You mean addition with an unknown. . variable. Good! So we put an X for our unknown variable. And? Great job! Why didn't you become a teacher? Shhh. What's wrong? Don't you like it in the new high-rise? Sure, I do. I'm putting the curtains up. But something's wrong. -Asta is worrying me. -But why? She's well cared for at her aunt's. -Well, it can't go on like this. -There, there. Don't let it get you down, eh? Do you really mean that, Mr. Kubinke? Always. Always. -Since when is there no light? -I can't stand it here anymore. I can't either. Came in the mail. I've seen it already. -Mrs. Fertig was in Potsdam. -Do you want to play school? I'd rather you didn't tear so many socks. We just don't have any luck. Give it here. Well, I don't know. Maybe we planned too much. But they say not to give up when you're right. Is that so? Are we in the right? Was it right because we missed each other and wanted to stay together? If I'm put into foster care, do you think that's right? Won't you be sad when I don't live here anymore and hardly visit you? You have your new apartment and will be much better off, and you won't have to darn my socks anymore. When I visit you, we'll go to the circus again. Then we'll see the clown again. I don't even remember what he looked like. I remember his clothes, but I forgot his face. If you close your eyes, you can picture him. Now I'm thinking of the circus and the funny things the clown did. That was so nice. I'd love to go to the circus now. Come! Ready? Let's go. Watch out! What are you doing here? You can't understand me, right? You don't understand me. Let's begin. -Here you go. -That's for you. Here. You, too. -For you -There. And you. Here you go. Here. Here. -See you soon! -Goodbye!
