Dad, mom, they opened the way for people Of all these paranormal groups to start, And most of them will say it. If it wasn't for your parents, I wouldn't be doing this today. Narrator: During their extraordinary 50-year career, The warrens investigated thousands of reports Involving poltergeists, demons, and devils. But perhaps the most documented case of evil Is one that took place in ed warren's hometown. ♪♪ On Sunday, November 24, 1974, Ed and lorraine warren Receive a desperate call from their friend, Psychic, mary pascarella. Mary pascarella was director of The psychic research institute in hamden, connecticut. She was a personal friend of ours and she said, "ed, you have got to meet me at this house." Narrator: By the early 1970s, Lorraine, a clairvoyant, and ed, a demonologist, Have been investigating the paranormal For over 20 years, But to most people, the idea of investigating haunted houses Is a new phenomenon. Hall: Mary pascarella said, We have a real poltergeist case going on. There's police cars People are starting to form outside the house. And that's when ed said, "oh, okay, well, This sounds like the real deal. We'll be right over." Narrator: The warrens, Along with father william charbonneau, Arrive at the home of jerry and laura goodin. I went in the house and here were police officers, Firemen, the goodin family, neighbors, And it looked like somebody went through the house With a baseball bat, smashed things off of the walls, Knocked furniture over. Every one of these police officers, When myself and the priest walked in, They know and asked for the priest's blessing. They were frightened. Narrator: As part of his investigative technique, Ed warren tapes interviews with witnesses. In these rare recordings, We hear ed speaking with the first police officers Called to the scene. After talking with the officers, Ed knows he must experience the poltergeist himself To be certain it's real. Ed was really good at trying to rule out The logical physical causes and explanations. He would take a second look. He would not just take people's word for it. Ed: I was standing in the kitchen. I noticed that there was a movement From my peripheral vision, A set of melmac dishes flew across the room And landed on the floor. [ glass shatters ] A crucifix which was on a wall was made of plastic, just burst. ♪♪ Narrator: After confirming the existence of a poltergeist, The warrens gather more information To help the goodin family. In this unearthed recording, ed interviews the homeowners, Jerry and laura, about when the hauntings began. The goodins tell the warrens That the previous evening something attacked them. Jerry was bringing in the groceries, Laura's in the kitchen, And this table picked itself up, throwing groceries everywhere. And then these dishes come up and go flying. The knives came out of knife holder And were flown around the room. They didn't know what to do. Narrator: The goodins admit being confused, But not overly concerned. So they straightened up the kitchen, Hoping it's just an isolated experience, But it's not. Jerry's ready to go back in and say, "laura, you're not gonna believe this." Meanwhile, she's coming out Because other things are happening. They have these three heavy recliner chairs And they're opening and closing by themselves, All three of them in concert. It was horrifying. Narrator: That's when the goodins say they reached out To their neighbor for help, Off-duty police officer john holsworth. Several minutes later, patrol officers arrived on scene. When they witness the unexplained, The officers contact the fire department. Firemen, they don't know what to do Because they start witnessing things And they saw the tvs moving, They saw the chairs going in and out. It was pretty clear to them That this was not a job for the fire department. As the public statement went, We're not very good at fighting devils. Narrator: City engineers are also baffled By what is happening. Narrator: Outside, news of the strange Happenings on lindley street attract huge crowds. Just a few months before the film "the exorcist" Shocked audiences with its dramatic depictions Of the devil and the power of evil. So when news reports surfaced of an actual poltergeist case, What was once thought to be fiction Suddenly seems frighteningly real. Naturally, the media got word of it, And then it goes out on the ap wire, And now it's being reported around the country And it even goes outside the country. Judy: My friends had known about the bridgeport case Because it was the news all over town. So they said, "let's go down and see what's going on." And here's this massive crowd of people. I went to school with a policeman that was there And he looked at me and he said, "judy, this is real. This is real. What happened?" Narrator: Convinced they are dealing with A true poltergeist case, Ed asks father charbonneau to perform a house blessing. The religious ritual goes forward without a hitch Until they move to the basement. Narrator: Suddenly, as quickly as it appeared, The black mass vanishes. Meanwhile, upstairs, Father charbonneau seminary assistant, 21-year-old paul eno Sees lorraine coming under attack. Lorraine and I were sitting at the table. All of a sudden, lorraine kind of let out a little yelp And a blister formed right on her hand. ♪♪ Narrator: Coming up, previously unreleased recordings Of the investigation that made the warrens famous. ♪♪ ♪♪ The extraordinary happenings began on Friday, Some furniture began to move And then a crucifix fell off the wall. Narrator: Ed and lorraine warren had never investigated a case With so many eyewitnesses before, And by Sunday night, News of the bridgeport poltergeist Spreads far beyond the city limits. We had observed the movement of objects... Refrigerator, bureaus. No one could have possibly moved this thing. Narrator: The moment lorraine crosses the threshold, She feels the house acknowledge her presence. Then it begins to wage war. Ed became quite concerned that the energy could especially Affect her being sensitive to these things. And he was worried about something much bigger. Ed and father charbonneau Take lorraine home for the night, But leave paul eno behind to keep watch over the family, Especially the goodins' 10-year-old marcia. Ed told me to keep an eye on her, to stay with her, To make sure she wasn't doing any of these things Because there was a natural assumption That the child who seemed to be the center of the phenomena Would be the one perpetrating it. Narrator: The next evening, While playing a board game with marcia, Paul senses something wrong, All of a sudden I felt a surge of energy. There was like an ozone smell. I looked into the kitchen. The air had turn like this gauzy, whitish color. I picked up a orthodox prayer book And I started reading an akathist or hymn To the glory of christ. Narrator: According to paul, That's when the gauzy mist forms into four separate shapes. Just instinctively, I pushed against it. It pushed back. It was a solid structure, almost the skeletons of birds. That's what it felt like. There was a bone structure there. When the entity was standing in front of me, I got angry and I was also fearful Because I knew it was after the little girl. I wanted to protect her. Paul: The energy was so strong at that point, I decided to pull everybody out of the house Because I didn't know what would happen. It felt like the place was gonna explode. Narrator: Convinced they are dealing with something demonic, The warrens make plans to perform an exorcism. Paul: Marcy hugged me said, "promise, promise me you'll come back." And I did. Mrs. Gordon hugged me and said, "promise us you'll come back." Narrator: The following morning, Police superintendent joseph walsh Declares the haunting a hoax perpetrated by marcia goodin. The exorcism would never take place. The girl admitted that since last Friday, She's been banging on walls, knocking pictures off. We have no ghost in bridgeport. Chief walsh made it his business To make sure that he was going to call that a hoax. It's impossible that this was a hoax. Apparently, right after we had left, Superintendent walsh had sent officers into the house. Said this ends here now. Ed: He not only made fools out of the family and us, He made fools out of his own men. These police officers were going into the media, Which were all around the house, in the house, Telling them about the things that they experienced. Hall: Ed was very frustrated by it all. He thought with all of these police officers, All of these firefighters, all of these media people, That the truth finally would come out About poltergeist activity. Narrator: Two months later, Vindication comes when the police department Allows a parapsychology group To tape record interviews with the police officers. Today, those tapes, most never before shared with the public, Offer a unique insight into what many describe As the roswell of haunted houses. Hall: Something happened. You can argue if you want, whether it's a poltergeist, Whether a poltergeist is a demon, But something happened And nobody really could explain what happened. That case stands out in my mind And the annals of psychic research As one of the most powerful, most credible cases Of poltergeist activity ever recorded. And it was recorded. Narrator: Despite a widespread belief That something paranormal had occurred, The bridgeport incident fails to convince a skeptical public That demons do exist. Their mission in life was to let people know That the devil existed, that he was real. ♪♪ Narrator: Understanding the paranormal Is something ed's been obsessed with since he was a young boy Growing up in bridgeport, connecticut. Ed: I lived in a haunted house when I was a boy. Many times I would hear the closet door opening up. I'd look into that closet darkness, I start to see a light starting to form, And I went into like a ball shape And then I'd see face in that wall. It was a face of an old lady.

Narrator: Like ed, lorraine is a child when she first discovers The supernatural and her clairvoyant abilities. ♪♪ Lorraine: It started when I was probably about 9 years old, When I first had experiences Where I could see lights around people, But the lights that I could see around people, I thought everybody could see that.

Lorraine says, "hey, look, sister joseph lights, look. Her lights are brighter than mother superior's lights." What she was seeing was the aura Around mother superior and around sister joseph. Anything that's alive that god has created has an aura And a certain psychic can see the aura. And when she said her lights are brighter, She meant the aura was more spectacular, More colors emanating from around her body. Mother superior overhears this conversation about the lights Between the two girls, she walks over to lorraine. She says, "lorraine, we don't speak of things like that here." Lorraine: Couldn't share things like that with the nuns. That was very much frowned upon, and if I tried at home, It was fine as long as I could joke and lighthearted, But it was never anything to be discussed seriously. And lorraine related to me later, She said it many times, "I never wanted to be different. In fact, I never even told my parents." Narrator: Lorraine's life changes when, as a teenager, She meets ed at the local movie theater where he worked. Ed: I was an usher in a small theater called the colonial. She used to come with her mother every Wednesday night. We started talking and became friends And I was 16 at the time, she was 16. One night walked her home, asked her for a date. That's how it started. Then I went to the navy the day I was 17. And while I was in the navy, we wrote back and forth. Lorraine: Most of our courtship, we were kids And it was through mail Because ed had entered the service soon after we met. Narrator: While serving in the navy during world war ii, A life-threatening experience proved to ed once and for all That there was a greater spiritual dimension to life.

He only had a few hours to do it and get back, but he did it. He married lorraine in may 22, 1945. She was 18 and he was going on 19. Ed: We got married in bridgeport, Had a great big honeymoon. One night, took a train to new haven, Stayed at the taft hotel, And came back in the morning left for the navy again.

Narrator: After the war and supports his family As an artist selling paintings of homes And landscapes to tourists visiting new England. Belanger: He was selling the paintings for $3 and $5. Back then, it was a pretty good haul if he sold five Or six paintings in a day, he did pretty well. But then they were always interested in haunted places. Narrator: While traveling through new England, Ed and lorraine visit the ocean-born mary house, A legendary haunted residence Located in henniker, new hampshire. Curious, ed talks with the homeowner, louis roy, About his experiences with the house. While he's interviewing mr. Roy, Lorraine is... she's over the back of the chair like this, Listening to ed very, very diligently. All of a sudden ed asks lorraine a question like, "isn't that right, lorraine?" no answer. He looks back and lorraine is staring like this In a trance-like state. Ed starts getting really nervous. He's like, "mr. Roy, what's what's wrong? My wife there. What's happening?" Mr. Roy very calmly says, "that happens to a lot of clairvoyants in the house." Lorraine leaves her body and looks down And she can see ed talking to mr. Roy and she said, "that was the first time I knew not to fear death." But all of a sudden, she snapped back into her body Like somebody jolted her back into her body. Narrator: Lorraine's clairvoyance inspires ed To seek out other haunted houses. Ed would read about these places. Then he'd go up and find the location And he'd paint the house. Ed: I do a real nice sketch of the house, Ghosts coming out of it and everything, you know, And give it to lorraine and she go knock on the door And with her irish personality, She'd say, "oh, my husband loves to sketch And paint haunted houses, and he made this for you." And that would pretty much be their ticket in. They would get to talk To the homeowners about their ghosts, And ed would learn that they've had experiences That are pretty similar to what he went through as a child. And from there, an entire career developed. It progressed from just talking about the ghosts To people calling them in on cases to come and observe What's going on in the house or to clear the house. Hawes: And they would talk with anybody about cases And their views of the paranormal. That influenced me in the ways Of just understanding that everybody's different. Everybody has paranormal problems. Typically, the people who had contact The warrens would be family. It doesn't matter, Socioeconomic background doesn't matter, Race, ethnicity are people of all ages. It gets to the point between the 1950s into the 1960s, If you lived especially in new England And you had a weird ghost story in your house, You would find them and ask them to come to your home And check it out because no one else was doing it. Narrator: For ed and lorraine, both devout roman catholics, A belief in the supernatural comes naturally. Ed: Now, I was brought up a catholic. My father was a very strict catholic. And I can remember one time, father tomasco He said to my father, "you know, frank, "you won't believe what's happening "two blocks away from here. There's a man under possession." He said, "this guy takes on the appearance of a pig "and makes noises like a pig. "there's these foul smells. So we are going to perform The rite of exorcism over this man." Now, I'm only 8 years old, but that was the very first time I ever heard about anything like that. Ben: Our perspective plays a lot into the paranormal phenomena In general. What we bring into the situation Is what we're going to get out of it. The warrens, they were both roman catholic, So they had that belief system framework on the phenomenon. Narrator: By the early 1970s, ed and lorraine Have investigated hundreds of hauntings And are known as the seekers Of the supernatural throughout new England.

It's terrifying. It's that line of not understanding, I think, That drives everyday ghost hunters To want to find out what it is, Why they want to gather evidence. There's that need to not just prove to themselves That it's real, But to prove to everybody else, this is real, this is happening. Narrator: A devout catholic, Ed views the paranormal through his religious beliefs To exorcise any demons, he must invoke the power of the church. Ed uses audio and video recordings As proof to convince church leaders to become involved. More often than not, It's an uphill battle. Ed and lorraine warren initially started Investigating homes throughout new England Because a lot of paranormal activity seems to reside here. Belanger: Ed wanted to find out Have other people lived in haunted houses? What was it like for them? And he never stopped looking from age 5 Until the day he died, looking for more haunted houses, Wanting to talk to people about their experience in those homes.

Lorraine would put her hands out when she would walk into a room, And you usually knew when she was getting something Because she'd have a certain look on her face. Sometimes she would even interact with it. She would ask a question and listen for the response. Narrator: In the perron farmhouse, Lorraine picks up the presence Of what appears to be a female spirit. Belanger: Ed depended on lorraine a lot. So if lorraine says "I'm not picking anything up," That was good enough for ed to say, Maybe this place isn't haunted. So because lorraine was picking something up in this house, Ed is now focused, hyper focused. He's thinking something is going on here. What it is he doesn't quite know yet Because this is just the very early stages. This is just the first investigation. They're gonna have to dive in deeper. They're gonna have to connect With whatever is here to try to identify it. Is it just the spirit of a person that lived here Or died here or is it something more sinister?

Narrator: The warrens find themselves In high demand for interviews, speaking engagements, And especially college lecture tours. Belanger: I remember attending their lectures. I had never seen a ghost. I had friends who lived in haunted houses. But when you saw an ed and lorraine warren lecture, They played video clips, They played audio clips, they showed you pictures. And I remember sitting there thinking, "oh, my god, maybe now I have seen a ghost." Tony: College kids are drawn into this like A moth to a flame. But ed didn't do it just for entertainment purposes. Ed would say to me, "I'm here to also give a warning "not to dabble in occult practices, "that the devil exists, that the devil is real, "and don't dabble with ouija boards. "don't go to a psychic reader, don't do any of that stuff. "you're opening doors. "and once you open the door up, very difficult, If not impossible to close that door." He holds the unique title of demonologist. She's a psychic. Would you welcome ed and lorraine warren. [ applause ] We... we, uh... We thought it'd be fun to have a couple of demons on the show. I think we better bless them first. Belanger: There weren't paranormal ghost hunting shows Back then, there were none. It was just people like ed and lorraine willing to Put themselves out there, willing to talk about it, Put themselves up to ridicule, get called hoaxers. And that broke down a ton of walls. Once we start talking about something, Then it becomes out in the open. Ed: I don't mind skeptics. That means they're open-minded. But show me a closed-minded atheist and I say, Put up your money or shut your mouth Because we can prove that there is to our evidence. Lorraine: Where haunting phenomenon is concerned, We have never really met a true atheist In a haunted home. I was there. I saw it firsthand. I know the work that ed and lorraine did. They were willing to take that risk for other people, For strangers, And to be the subject of ridicule like that. It was very difficult for them. Narrator: Lorraine attempts to quiet critics By undergoing scientific testing by parapsychologists at ucla. The team of scientists led by dr. Thelma moss put lorraine Through a battery of tests that indicate She is what they call a light trance medium. A deep trance medium will have a spirit guide come through And when that part is over, they wake up And they might not be aware of what they said or did. Lorraine was always aware in this light trance state. She's going to another plane. ♪♪ But is still aware of all of her surroundings. She was found to be well above average in psychic ability, Which kind of vindicated her in her mind. Now, she had real test results that proved that she was not Just like making up stories.

One night he screamed at these devils. "take me on, leave my little buddy alone." When you challenge the demonic, It doesn't act at that particular time. It waits until you are the most vulnerable, Then it strikes. We're gonna have to prove to a jury That there is such a thing as demonic possession. Belanger: The warrens are out to establish in the court of law That demonic possession is possible. And if it can be used successfully in a legal defense, Then from ed warren's perspective, We have legal precedent of the existence of demons And that it can affect a person's actions And activities. Narrator: Johnson's fiancée, deborah glatzel, Backs up arne's story of demonic possession. What did you see take place? - All hell broke loose. - What do you mean? With the growling, when he went under demonic attack. What about the actual stabbing? Did you see mr. Bono fall? No, I never saw mr. Bono get stabbed. ♪♪ Narrator: In November, nine months after The stabbing of alan bono, The judge in arne johnson's case makes his ruling. The judge listened to precedents, to arguments, And then he said that demonic possession Is not an acceptable offense. It is irrelevant in this case. And unfortunately, united states, It is not a science and he will permit no evidence On demonic possession and devils. Ed: If the judge had let us bring in our evidence And the priests waiting outside of the courthouse To testify that what occurred to this young boy, arne johnson, Was indeed a diabolical possession. The judge didn't want to be known as the judge Who allowed "the devil made me do it" case Into his courtroom. Ed and lorraine's daughter remembers the case well. Judy: I know debbie glatzel personally and arne johnson. I believe that the paranormal exists, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, I do. I can't help but believe it If you're around it as much as I was.

Well, a family in west pittston, pennsylvania, Says this is a nightly horror they endure. Man: The strange happenings at the home of the small family Began the day daughter dawn received her confirmation. My parents see it And sometimes they hear a heartbeat In the middle of them when they're sleeping And the closet door's open.

Narrator: After enduring a series of hauntings, Jack and janet smurl ask for help From their local catholic diocese, but to no avail. Cast doubt ye evil demons. New york's cardinal john o'connor Revealed that a priest performed exorcisms On people who were allegedly possessed by the devil. Our guests are janet and jack smurl. Who did you bring in to help you? We went to our local priest, and said, "father, There's something very strange going on here." So he came over. He blessed the home and said, "there's no one here who can help you." Narrator: After the church diocese fails to send help The smurls contact the warrens. Ed: I'll never forget I was driving up to west pittston. It's in a coal mining area and they thought, well, Maybe something was happening underneath Because of the old mine shafts. Lorraine: When phenomena first began to occur in this house, They tried everything. They called people. They called the church. The priest came out and blessed it. But so much more was needed. Ed: The smurls lying in bed one night And all of a sudden the bed starts to rattle and shake. Then they start seeing black shadows Moving across the bedroom And suddenly something grabs her by the leg and yanks her Right out of the bed onto the floor. Then there's the night when the both of them Were lying in bed and both of them Rise up into the air as high as the ceiling. Narrator: Several nights later, A demonic creature known as a succubus appears. Ed: Now a succubus is a name given to a demon or a devil. It attacks the male physically and sexually. Jack is sitting down in his living room. It's about 10:00 at night, just about ready to go to bed. And he sees this woman coming down the stairs. Now from a distance, she looked very beautiful, But then as she came closer, the face changed And what he'd seen was a skeletal face With rotting teeth that attacked him. Why would a demon want to attack somebody sexually? Did they get pleasure out of it? No, they don't. It's an insult to the birth cycle of jesus christ and god, That's why they do it. Narrator: To save the smurl family, Ed and lorraine must do everything in their power To exorcise the succubus, Including religious provocation. Religious provocation is all about using your belief system, Your faith in this case, catholicism, To try to vanquish whatever evil might be in the building. Ed would bring in holy water. He would hold up holy relics like crosses, And he would tell Whatever entities were around in the name of jesus, get out. He pictured himself a warrior and these were his weapons. Ed: I had a police officer with me. We were walking down that hallway And I was using religious provocation When I felt a pressure, grab me right by the neck. Suddenly, ed finds himself under attack. Ed: This thing threw me back about 10 feet onto the bed. Police officer, he came in, And threw holy water at this thing. Finally, lessened up. ♪♪ Narrator: The succubus proves too powerful for ed and lorraine To battle by themselves, they need reinforcements, But when the warrens approach the catholic church for help, They are turned away. During the time the warrens were really at the peak Of their investigations, they were having a hard time Because the church was keeping all these things a secret About performing these exorcisms. So they were shunning the warrens. Nothing made ed warren more angry than if you went To the local catholic priest And said, "you've got a family in your community in need." And if that priest said, "no, no, I don't do that. There's no such thing as ghosts." That infuriated ed. So he had no qualms whatsoever about using his fame To escalate the situation, to get the media involved. Man: What do you want the church to do? We would like him to bring in two or three priests Who are exorcists to clear this house Of what is here. Why doesn't the family just move? They have left here. They have gone to a camp site. The same type of phenomena That had occurred to them in their home Also followed them to the camp site. None of you would be able to go Through what the smurls are going through.

Ed: Cardinal ratzinger assigned an exorcist From the catholic church who went to the house And performed the ritual of exorcism, The ritual romano in that house, which is very unusual Because they usually do that only over a person. And to this day, that house has been clear.

This is where diabolical spirits Are not actually possessing people, But rather they're inhabiting the place. What happens during an exorcism? During an exorcism, The church calls upon the power of christ To remove the devil from the person or the place.

Ed would call in a priest, Either catholic or of the family's faith, To do a blessing of the house, Sometimes a simple blessing will work. Ed: It's a set of prayers casting out evil spirits Out of a home or a location or out of a person Where they are diabolical, possessed.

You know, they're saying that scientifically you have To prove that god exists, that ghosts exist. There is no such thing. You can't get scientific in the supernatural world.
