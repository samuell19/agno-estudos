Please forgive me. Pretend you raising a weight. To the top, that's it. On the other side. Open your hand. You have a call on line two. It's the police. Thank you. Allo. You locked the car? Oh, shit. We're at Isafjorour. We should be fine. I'm joking. Don't worry. Yes, I locked it. Lif. Take a picture. - Hello. - Hello. - Dagny. - Freyr. Have you ever done this? No, this is my first. I spoke with Gerour, a pathologist. I saw it with her. I have a list. Hello. Halla Unnsteinsdottir. 71 years. She lived in Flateyri. She did all this? Looks like. Detach her now that you're here. Gentlemen. Will You do the autopsy? Gerour will do it tomorrow. He found her. I see. Hello. Freyr. - I'm a doctor at the hospital. - Einar Guojonsson. Please. have a seat People who die like that... Hanging... Death occurs as a result as the blood do not flows to the brain. People lose consciousness very quickly. They do not suffer. It's like to fall asleep. Aren't you... a psychiatrist? Freyr! Thank you for telling me. What you said... comforted me. Mostly because it's from you. After what happened to you. Yes. It's hard to imagine bieng able to overcome such a thing. Everyone... has things to manage. - It happens one day or the other. - Children do not disappear. That's right... I don't understand. Yet it happened to my son Benni. - Bye. - Yes. - You will sleep in the house? - Yes. It's a bad idea? Nobody lives there since the town was abandoned. I know. - You weren't here last summer? - No, I could not come. Welcome to the last view. Do you like it? - Well... There is plenty to do. - It was very different last summer.... - I know. - Everything will be different in a week. - To do what? We want to make guest rooms. There are many tourists in the summer. The only lodge was full All last summer. - It is not rotten? - No. The wood is very strong. Try. - It works. - Awesome. - There is a lot of room here. - Isn't it? I thought... Here, you can put bunk beds... and here, you can have a reading corner. Wasn't it the children's room? Yes. Looks like. Tell me. How are you? We haven't seen each other since last summer. Thanks for asking. I'm much better. I feel I have said goodbye to him. I do not take any medicine and I see a psychiatrist once a week.. He says we never really recover. It is the home of the doctor where you stayed last summer? Yes, that's it. See you in a week. - Yes. - But... If something happens You can call me. I thought we were without a network here. Well... If you go up the hill you will have network. See you soon. You keep in shape? Yes. It is also... to clear my head. It really helps. - You run? - No. I can not find anything more boring than running in circles At least you are visiting the city. You ran in all the streets. You could say that. - I'm at number 23. - Oh good. Would you like a coffee? Yes. Let's go. In my profession, we're talking about signs of obsessive behavior. I woke up here the other day and I did not remember the face of Benni. What do you think happened? I'm sorry. No no. It does not matter. Benni was playing hide and seek with a friend when he disappeared. When eight-year-old play hide-and-seek, they're not hiding behind a lamppost or a Bush. They can be very ambitious. Then... we searched everywhere. Everywhere. Over and over again. Hundreds of people have looked for him. Throughout the country. Do you think he's still alive? No, Benni is not alive anymore. Benni was suffering from congenital diabetes. He had just received his insulin shot when he went out to play. Which means that... if he had not eaten for several hours, his body would have gone into shock. He would have lost consciousness. Still want coffee? Hello. Hello. I think your wife is cold. Oh, really? I want you. Lif. Lif! I'm going to fuck my husband. Stop it. Are you sure you're ready? You don't want? Of course. MOM. MOM. - Hey. - Hi. - Everything ok? - I was trying to make him understand that to have a toilet, we need running water and we will not get it before next summer.. If your prince can't poop in a bucket, let him restrain himself.. She's crazy. How are you? It's good to see you. - Where were you? - I walked around the corner and I found the cemetery. The cemetery? Did you see ghosts? Anyone there? MORGUE It was good to get back to work. Are you trying to make a sauna of this house? - The stove is out of control. - You're out of control. Isn't this amazing that nobody lived in this house in 60 years? It is time for her to get a new life. - New life, Lif. - Bravo. Your drum roll is worthless. Well, I'm going up. You go to bed? Good night. I'm going with you. - Good night. - Good night. I'll turn off the generator. This series of scars is all recent. Last 24 hours. The oldest... are three or four years old. All in form of cross. It's impossible that she did them herself. Bjarni is here. The widower. Yes. All right. In fact, our marriage was deteriorating its last years. And why that? I don't really know. Maybe because you mistreated her? No way! Why the hell would you think that? Why the cross? Are you practicing, Bjarni? I swear that I never did hurt my Halla. Do you know someone who wanted to hurt her? No. One day, when he wakes up I noticed blood on the back of her nightgown. She said I have eczema. Does the name Bernodus tell you anything? No. Very well. Do you believe it? His daughter confirms that he was with her in the South this week. He could not do the recent scars. It is unlikely that he did the others. Yes. She said something else. Halla was recluse and distant since a friend of hers died. It often happens to people of that age when their friends die. They depress when they realize that their end is coming Did not you say that Gerour would do the autopsy? Yes, she arrives at noon. So why did you look at the back of the body? Excuse me? I was working late and... The electricity stopped so I went down... in the cellar. I wanted to make sure that everything was in order for the autopsy. Why are you embarrassed? Who was this person which you told him about? Yes... Bernodus. It would be nice to have your professional opinion on something. Do you have time to go to the police station? We found an old case linked to the Church of Halla's death. The chief of police at the time was a prolific amateur filmmaker. The Church was dismantled and removed from Hesteyri in 1956 after the abandonment of the village. The old villagers have not at all appreciated, to be nice. DIRTY Does that remind you of something? What year was that? 1956. 60 years ago. Veigar, do you have the latest pictures? Do you think it's the same person? Yes quite. Looks like... You can see how this is done. All uppercase except the E. The point of the I. I think it's obvious. Halla did that? She was from Hesteyri? The old villagers were furious to see the church moved? Yes, but she was from Isafjorour. This picture dates from a year before the degradation of the church. In 1956. Halla Unnsteinsdottir. There she is. She was 10 years old. Why is there a cross on some faces? That is a good question. This photo was found in this boy's house. His name is Bernodus Petursson. It is written here... "Bernodus has been caught red-handed vandalism in the Church." he was from Hesteyri and moved here. Bernodus is mentioned in another case of that time. Five days after being caught in the act... He... Bernodus Petursson disappeared without a trace. They never found him. I'm so tired. - You want a beer? - Good idea. But I'm not getting them. Me neither. That's life, honey. Oh, really? - Hell. - Awesome. It is nailed to the floor. I can't move it. Did you get the PIN? Garoar? What happened? You fell in the stream? No, I jumped in. - What are you doing with a cross? - Bergdis Ebenesardottir. - It should be in the cemetery. There was a hole instead, as if a cross had been removed. And I found it in the Creek. What is it doing here? How do I know? You did take the beer? It's just that... the electric generator is stopped? - Yes. We think that it is broken. It would be nice to have a beer. I'm not going! All right. Katrin. Katrin. No! Hold on! - Okay. - Do not move her. - Talk to me. - Yes. I fell. - Have you fallen? - Yes. - Does it hurt anywhere? - Here. On my leg. Hurt in the leg? - Can you move? - Yes. - Can you sit? - Yes. Let me see. Is it broken? I don't know. It hurts? - Yes. - And here? I'll call to request an emergency helicopter. This isn't worth it. - It's just a sprain. - No, I'll call the boat. - You need to go to the hospital.. - All right. Wait, the pillow. Yes. You want one? - Two. - Okay. So there it is. Thank you. - Lie down. - One moment. I'll call the boat tomorrow, my love. Everything is classified by year. Bernodus was nicknamed "dirty" and "impure" when he refused to undress and shower after the gym.. The scars date from different times. It lasted for years. 18 cross in total. The poor boy was abused for years. The father was a drunkard and had probably mental problems.. It is written that he was an altar server in Hesteyri and he was very upset when the church was moved. The school nurse did a report, but it appears to have been ignored. Horrible. At that time children were not protected like now. They ignored the harassment His parents. The mother, Bergdis Ebenesardottir, died at the birth of Bernodus. The father had to blame Bernodus. My God. Look. Eight children have been marked with a cross. Halla is one of them. Of those eight, six have died. Excuse me? Six of the eight are dead? - Before for 70 years? - Exactly. All died in the last three years. And more... All died of accidents. Except Halla, of course. She hung herself. Gunnhildur Gisladottir. She drowned. Two years ago. Jon Avarsson. Burns to death. His house caught fire at night. Sigvaldi Konraosson. He died of cold. He got lost walking on the Vatnajokull ice cap. Then, this one. Steinn Gunnbjornsson. He died in a car accident. 18 months ago. Finally, this one. Vedis Arngrimsdottir. She was the first to die. Falling on her garden shears, she lost all of her blood. Oh, really? They are sure it was an accident? How do we fall on shears? Is it possible that Bernodus has been hiding somewhere? Maybe he went to Reykjavik, he changed his name, and he came back a few years ago to take revenge.. Think about it. The kids that are scratched have brutalized him a lot. Now, they all die in a strange way. So, you are looking for a 70 years old serial killer. I'm sorry, I'm late. Let's start. Hello Hi, dad. Hi, Dad. It's funny? Look at Mommy. Hello I want to show you something. You have five minutes? Yes. Come in. The last images of Benni before his disappearance. In the gas station at Artunshofoi. What do you want to show me? I just got it. It comes from the autopsy of Vedis the one that fell on the shears. My God. Take a look. The same scars on the back of Bernodus. And on Halla's It could be a kind of religious sect? All these crosses and the desecration of the Church. Impure. These two are still alive. What do they say? This one, Ursula Astraosdottir, - She's in a home care here. - Ursula? I met her. Yes, that's it. She's schizophrenic. She did not say a word both times when is saw her. And then this one. Larus Helgason. He is a farmer in Onundarfjorour. I can't reach him. He does not answer. We're going on the hill. We didn't want to wake you up. Kisses. Is there someone? Garoar. Hello. DIRTY Dagny. Hi it's dagny, we've got a corpse.. Search unprecedented after the disappearance of the boy Last known picture of Benni Bernodus writing 1955 This is Katrin? Katrin. Katrin, are you there? Katrin. What are you doing? All right? What happened? I swear... that there's someone downstairs. There's someone, someone. Down there? What happened? Tell me. There was... I went downstairs. I couldn't open the door. I did not know there was a basement here. Hey, Girls. Did you know there was a cellar? There is a body downstairs. - How's that? - There's a child's body down there! - The body of a child? - When does the boat arrive? We found no network. We tried and tried. There is no signal here. - I can't stay here. - Me neither. We must again try to call. Go further. I can't stay in this damn House. I want to leave! - All right. - We are going to the doctor's house. Ok? Hundreds of volunteers looking for Benedikt Are you okay? I don't understand. The whole country has followed the story. Not like that. It is a complete stranger. Why he was so obsessed with Benni? Maybe it was a hobby. There's nothing here. But I can understand that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, when I try to remember him I only see this blue jacket Last known picture of Benni It was his favorite. - The stretcher is ready? - In the car. You know how he died? We think that he drank some drain cleaner. No one has lived in the House since the city has been abandoned? I don't think so. This child must have a relationship with the former owners. Or It could be anyone. Still no network. I'll prepare the beds. Garoar! Garoar! Yes? What is it? - You put it there? - What? It's not funny! - I did not put it there. - Don't play with me! - You put it there? - You're crazy? Watch it! What the hell are you doing? Sweetheart. Hello, Ursula. I'm Freyr. The new doctor at the hospital. Do you remember? I want to ask you few questions if this is possible. The photo. please Do you remember these children? Here, it's you. And The boy... here it's Bernodus Petursson. Do you remember him? He disappeared without a trace. No one never saw him again. Ursula. Do you know what happened to him? Benni is at the bottom. Around Him everything is green. Excuse me? Ursula. Benni what? You are talking about Benni? What did you say? Where is Benni? Why everything is green? Why? Ursula. Answer me. What did you say? You said "Benni" what for? Benni what? - Freyr. - Answer me. Ursula. - Freyr. - Freyr. He said Benni hid in a green submarine. Don't you remember? Can You take a look for me? It must be in boxes. Yes. Just... Yes, please. Take a look Yes, yes, of course. I'm on the first plane tomorrow. What did Ursula say to you? I think she mentioned Benni, but it was not clear I must go. Katrin! Katrin. We must get out of here. We must get out of here. There you must eat, Katrin. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday morning. We are not alone here. I saw... I saw a little boy. It was a mistake... to have come here It's been so soon since... Since what? Since I had to... give birth to our son? - Stillborn. Say it. - Kata - Why do you have to do that? - What? It was also traumatic for me All these crap, no one could ever thinks of it non stop You did not speak to me... I had the impression that I never did enough Why was it so important that Lif does not come with us? Answer me. What happened between you last summer? It was over between us anyway. Isn't it? Sometimes things happen quite simply Without being able to control them. Hello. Hello. How are you? Freyr, you wanted to see police reports yes. You know where they are. Hello, Oli. Do you remember us? We are Benni's parents His mom is here. You remember her. Hey, Oli. What are you doing? You're playing a video game? Oli. We would like you to talk again about the green submarine Oli. wait please, wait. - Oli, are you all right? - Everything is fine Oli, Can you describe the submarine? You said he was green Oli, it was not a submarine, there is none in Iceland! - Why did you lie? - Freyr. - Oli! - Freyr, let him go. Well... how the psychiatrist that you are would describe this behavior? I want you to meet someone. Why should we talk to a lawyer? I haven't the time. I have a plane to catch. Hello. - Elias Bjornsson. - Hello, Freyr. Can I offer you something to drink? Water, coffee? Please forgive me. Tell me... - What are we doing here? - Freyr. Elias helped me a lot these last months I see. He came into contact with Benni excuse me? It would be more accurate to say that... Benni contacted me I have neither the time nor the patience for this nonsense. Freyr, can you at least listen? Vilhjalmur Alvar of the Arion Bank. I'll call him back in ten minutes Listen. Benni is stuck. He is stuck between two worlds. Sometimes when the end of a life is not resolved people are unable to achieve the next level. When... the body has not been found or when we do not know what happened The only thing that can release these souls of their suffering is to find their bodies. And solve the mystery of their death. Oh, really? I see. And then? If these souls do not reach the next level of existence. They stay stuck. And over time, they gain power and their problem becomes an obsession. Resentment. And anger can make them become visible they have the ability to move And for you... who were part of their lives represents a great danger We must find the body of Benni As soon as possible. Or the consequences will be serious. What do you think we have been doing for three years? It has ruined our lives. If one day, I need a lawyer, I'll contact you maybe. Does the name bernodus is a name that means something to you? He keeps coming back. I don't understand why. Ah, I slept well. Have you eaten something? Where is Garoar? Is everything all right? So, This is where You jumped him on the counter? Katrin. What happened? What did you tell her? What... I just told the truth. The truth, what truth? I have not said everything of course Why did you do that? She faced me. We said we'd wait our return to the city. She didn't know anything, she just had some suspicions, she just tried to make you talk No, Lif. I know her, It's been twelve years with Katrin I know her. I read it in his eyes. She will not bear it. No. She is so disturbed Lif, Look at me. Everything will be fine. Now, we just need to.. Go ahead. I Love you. I love you. No. I'll call for help. Hold on! Ursula. - What are you doing here? It's not always so mean to me Who? Bernodus. He was here with you in the boat? Bernodus. He is always with me. Always. They always laughed at him. I am the only one to have seen where he went I never told anyone. Never, no. Everything is green. Green? Where is everything green? Ursula. Bernodus went with the boat. What ship? The one in which we are? I never told anyone. Never. No. Everything is green. Green. Ursula. Benni is at the bottom, everything is green. That's what you said.. Do you remember? Why do you say that? Where is this place? Where everything is green? Benni woke him. Benni woke him up? Bernodus? He shouldn't had wake him up. Ursula. Ursula. How are you feeling? Why were you in this boat in the middle of the night? I saw a boy. I followed him here. A boy? It was as if... He wanted me to follow him. Up to Ursula. Who was the boy? I can't... Freyr. Bernodus. I already saw him before. I have the impression He is trying to He is trying to help me. And this medium... which claims to be in contact with Benni He also said his name. Bernodus. Ursula has also talked about Bernodus I think I'm losing my head I become one of my patients Why can't I find him? Why can't I find Benni? - What is going on? - I need more green - I need more green. - You should sleep Never mind. Good Morning. Sorry, I was asleep. What? Excuse-me. He has always said that Benni was hiding in a green submarine. Ursula said: "Benni is at the bottom. Everything is green." At the bottom of the ocean? I don't know. Let me see something. A septic tank? Look at this. Hold on. You still have the video of the gas station with Benni? Yes of course. This is. Let's see. There. I did not make the connection until now Hold on. These three. - They were there when Benni left. - And? They ate there. That's why they stayed so long. This one was taken in the tunnel. We don't see clearly the trailer. That's it. it's here. Hesteyri. The search for Benni had to to be in full swing at that time You surely did not pay attention to other news There is a whale depessing plant abandoned outside the village. They found the body of Garoar Magnusson and Lif Einarsdottir. Lif was pregnant with their child. Katrin iorsdottir, Garoar wife... She must have tried to seek help by foot His body has never been found despite the research The phone of Lif was found with Katrin's imprints on it She had tried to call for help. I knew it was a bad idea to repair this old House. She is totally rotten - You can help us outside? - Of course. Caption by PatrickMiami - PhantomP2P
