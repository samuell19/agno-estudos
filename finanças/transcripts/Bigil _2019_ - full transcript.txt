After this match, they won't chant it In just 5 minutes I'll make this entire crowd ...go still as a statue! Enjoy the final 5 minutes of your fame Do you think I'm arrogant? Yes Arrogance from being champion for the past 8 years! Friend Success will mask your eyes Only failure will teach you lessons We should always play to win Not to defeat the opponent You'll learn it eventually! 'Who will get the cup? Manipur or Tamil Nadu?' 'We will wait and watch' Winners! Alex Rayappan This is your last warning In your fighting spree ...in the last 3 months 13 people have been affected Like to comment? We are the affected party, sir Ask the culprit, sir They started and we finished it What do you say, Ravuthar? 'Attack on the right side for Manipur' 'And Manipur draws the 1st-' He is committing a mistake, sir To stop him from committing that crime... ...we have to count...counteract Police will question an offender Do people have implicit faith? If yes, then why do they ask us to protect them? Just because you fa...il to do your job, we are forced to act on your behalf I'm staying away from all this out of my own will, not because I can't Don't unnecessarily drag me into this You will face the repercussions If I decide to get into the arena ...it won't be a sil...silent entry What do you say, minister? 'That's a goal' They have pickled us to pieces! 2 - 0!! Just 2 - 0, da You are playing to prevent his goal Play to score a goal! Can any other team defeat us in our own soil? Enough of watching them play Let us show them our game 'In the 2nd half our Tamil Nadu team is starting with a new adrenalin rush' 'Goals are needed in this half' 'What a fabulous goal by Bigil!' 'I don't have to reveal the architect of this comeback' His name is Bigil And you know it only too well Rayappan, what are you saying finally? I don't need post, money or power, sir I just need peace for my people I want to usher them to the next level I don't care who comes in between to stop my mission Whoever the intruder he is answerable to me - All is well! - Hey...!! I'm talking to you and you have the gall to leave? Sit down, I say Bloody fellow! Whaaat? What? What? How old are you? Spewing cuss words on elders Didn't your father tell you not to use such words? - Huh? - Don't! Not right! 'Bigil' Rayappan is old You thought if you advise him he will toe the line? What do you want now? All this should be wrapped up in the next 7 days, right? - What day is it today? - Monday I'll wrap it up by next Monday Every...loose end I'll tie it up Well done, my buddy What a fantastic game! - Totally international standard - Thank you, sir Proud to have you in our national team In this season alone... - I believe you scored 28 goals? - Yes, sir Not just as a player ...but your captainship was very mature If all goes well... ...plenty of possibilities for you to lead the Indian team But let's see what the selection committee has in mind 'Exam in 3 months, bro' I am attending coaching classes I'll definitely pass, bro What, buddy? They tricked us Our names aren't even on the list You can't be serious? - None of our names? - Forget us, bro He claimed you may be selected as captain and your name isn't even in the list Bigil, what happened? Nothing, pa - Appa - Wait, let's talk it over Kathir, what's the problem? He's asking you, tell him National team's list has been released But without our names - Your name, huh? - Not even Bigil anna's name - Pccht! Dai! - How did they miss out your name? He said you may even be selected as captain Only Bigil bro has hit maximum goals this season Imagine national team without his name when he has set a new record This State selectors have some hidden agenda I'll find out from the Federation and I'll tell you, leave it to me - You'll handle it? - I'll take care, pa It will be sorted out, son? I can deal with this Leave it to me, pa No, my dear son, all this should not be de...layed, we must handle it immediately Get the car - Start the car - All of you get in Dha dha dha!

Selection committee doesn't see it that way, Rayappan Everything was right When we checked the background ...we found a minor hassle in the police report Your criminal record is the reason he was not taken in the team How is it connected with this, sir? There isn't a single case against him They didn't think that far Suppose your son is selected for our National team The entire team will travel in a bus If some random man wants to wreak his revenge on you ...attacks your son He won't be the only person who will be affected adversely All the players travelling in that bus They don't want to take such a risk I am deeply disappointed What to do? You tell me Sir He's different, sir My profession and his career have no connection whatsoever All he knows is only football, sir Qua...qual...qualified He's 100% qualified player, sir Don't ruin his life using me as a reason Forget everything else, sir Shouldn't you respect his skill, sir? So many children of thi...thi...thieves have become police officers Children of habitual drunkards have become doctors of repute The son of an ordinary shoemaker Wasn't he elected as President of America, sir? Sons are no longer like their fathers, sir You have to take my word on this, sir If you make up your mind this is possible This golden opportunity you will be giving him Not only for him So many who look up to him and want to become like him In...in...including all of them, sir Sorry, sir, I can't help this stam- It's okay Please, sir - My dearest son - Pa - Done - Really, pa? I spoke to him, he seems to have a heart of gold Yes, pa The 'profession' I am in is the main culprit 'I explained to him politely you're in no way connected with it' Chairman sir understood All your names will be on the list as early as tomorrow - Happy now? - Awesome [sniffles] Dha dha dha!

We can beat them hands down Now 4 of you have been chosen I should send off multiples of 4 in the future like this - We'll do it, pa - If we stand here we can't do anything - Let's board the train - Okay, we'll take leave, pa Dha dha dha chee! God bless you Bye bye, pa - Hey Bigil - Pa? You won't be here anyway for 15 days That ID card must have come to the station - Pa! - Where? That girl pretending to wave goodbye to the stationary train over there - Holding a red umbrella - Good lord! Donald! Bring that Mary Poppins with the red umbrella Kokila with an umbrella! - He's calling you - Michael's father will see me He is the one calling you I won't come Just come with me - Go in front - Welcome Angel Asirvatham Pa...! - Doctor, huh? - No, pa Physiotherapist Are you the daughter of Asirvatham who supplies water cans?

If only he had boarded that train on that day His life would have been totally different We went to Delhi without him But we couldn't achieve much We didn't know the politics involved in it as much as we knew to play the game, sir They sent us back home in just 1 week So we took up whatever job we could get Then one day Michael anna called me He wanted to meet me Form a club, da Football club Youngsters who are struggling 'Those who are talented but still deprived of opportunities' Boys, girls, children Anyone who dreams big Whoever they are Train them They didn't let any of us in, right? 'We'll train 100 players and send' 'Train with absolute confidence Let me see who can stop us' We have to regain what we lost This team was handpicked and formed with utmost care 'Each and every girl in this team was selected only by Bigil anna' 'The food the girls ate The clothes they wore' 'School fees Sports kit' 'Travel Medical' 'He was the one who gave them all this too' But he made me promise not one of them should know he was behind this, sir Dreams of these girls don't belong only to them It is Bigil's dream too 'That's why I'm telling you this' Only he can make this dream come true Alright, my boy Thank you for confiding in me We don't know what is in his mind - Let me go - Wait, Guna In what way did Kathir harm you? What did Kathir do to you? - Michael - Bro, let go I'll handle this He was absconding for a long time For the next 6 months, let him count bars in Tihar or Bihar 'He will tuck his tail in' 'Come, scumbag!' How can I- It won't be the same In whichever railway station you lost your dream 7 years ago ...in that same venue, 15 girls are waiting with that same dream now Waiting for someone to give them a hand Don't miss this train, bro Please Did you count our bags? - Vembu, what happened? - Berth confirmed, let's go Akka, a new coach is coming it seems, but no sign of him How do we play a match without a coach?

In your dreams, get in Association said they would send us a coach Hopes crashed, huh? 'Why are you still waiting?'

"Bigil will blow the whistle" 'Kabadi kabadi kabadi' I am Nessi, Tamil Nadu team manager Where is your team? 'How strange?'

They have shed a lot of sweat and tears to reach this place Give me whatever punishment you want Allow them to play, please If you utter one more word I'll ban you for lifetime Now sign and get out Excuse me, gentlemen - Sir...! - Please sit down Sit Please All of you know him only as Michael Rayappan Only I know... ...about Bigil He is the pride of our nation Our country's one of the finest football player! After so many years He's back Instead of welcoming him with open arms ...you are expelling him! There was a shoot out yesterday Put a commission File an FIR Let the police hold an inquiry And then I will take a decision NOT YOU! Sorry, sir - Bigil - Sir? You have an important match tomorrow, right? I'll deal with this You leave now - Good luck - See you 'Vanakkam and welcome' '...to this Senior Women's National Football Championship 2019' 'In the 1st match, Tamil Nadu is competing against the seasoned players of Manipur' Do you remember me, Bigil? Clear as crystal, my friend April 4th An unforgettable match in my life That was the last match I lost - Unforgettable match for me too - Why? Was that the last match you won? That was the last match I played! Bigil, for others this match is... Tamil Nadu vs Manipur As far as I'm concerned It is between Samar And Bigil All the best! Careful 'Tamil Nadu is playing against Manipur which has won the championship 18 times' Winners! Come on, girls Mad or what? Why did you pass it over there? Why did you come here? Okay...okay, Mari It's okay, relax 'Tamil Nadu coach is trying to pacify them but looks like it is a heated argument' 'Manipur team is playing with strong coordination on one side' 'But it is disappointing to see Tamil Nadu team lacking coordination' Relax...go Jenny Vembu Forward 'Manipur goal keeper has made a full length dive and saved beautifully' 'Manipur has played the 1st half exceedingly well' '2-0 is big advantage to Manipur' 'This will be a huge challenge for Tamil Nadu' 'We have to see how they play in the 2nd half' Thendral What? 'We have to wait and watch if Tamil Nadu will recover lost ground' Thendral 'We should see if Manipur strikes gold in the gap in between' Don't let her hit 'This is a stupendous victory for Manipur' 'Manipur fans are drenched in the rain of jubilation' Sorry, Bigil Hard luck You know if you lose 1 more match... ...you have to pack your bags and go home I think it's your 1st time in Delhi? Anyways Be a tourist and then go '1st match, your team was completely out of form' 'Easy win for Manipur' 'Do you feel bad you've lost so easily?' If we had a good coach, we would have certainly won this match I think the Federation is watching If they help us, we'll somehow win the remaining matches Thank you 'This team will bring home the cup for sure' 'In what way is a rowdy connected to a sportsman, sir?' 'Bigil' 'Cup is crucial, Bigil' 'If we had a good coach, we would have certainly won this match' What happened, Michael? Lost only 1 match Why should you lose heart and resign? I'm not leaving because they lost, sir I'm leaving only because I don't want them to lose even more Chatterjee, a friend from West Bengal ...will take charge tomorrow Thank you, sir For all the favors you extended to me Thank you Why did you come here? These are the fellows who targeted us in the hostel Not here, let's go out and talk, sorry, sir No, it has to be brought out in the open only here 'Only that will be correct' Do you know who sent them there? Here Why, sir? Rayappan...! Vanakkam 'Your criminal record is the reason he was not taken in the team' They don't want to take such a risk Sir 'My profession and his career have no connection whatsoever' That means... ...the reason I gave you isn't convincing Excuse me Rayappan, according to you Football is a mere sport As far as we are concerned it's a business! Sports means Dough! 'When a person represents National team once...' ...whether he or she wins or loses, they are eligible for a Govt job It is a secure job Railways, Customs, Airport 'Politicians, ministers, businessmen' For big shots like them ...it is a pride for their children to even feature in the national team They are willing to grease our palms to any extent, sky is the limit If I should bring your son into the team... ...how much will you pay? I won't even give you 10 paise! 'Sky is the limit for me too' 'If I stoop so low' ...it means I'm tarnishing my own son's talent He is extremely talented He will shine I'll take care You can't take care of anything superseding me I'm also a player, sir Our knowledge of football is zero But the way I play my game ...will be fan-atical! All is well, sir - My dear son - Appa Done! Bigil, stop at Ravuthar's shop I told him I'll drop by in the morning, I forgot Okay, pa You go, I'll make my way home Let's go Acting over-smart! I would have finished you in your own place You spoke as if the whole world was spinning under your feet? In the next half hour saw how your life changed? That's why I allowed you to boast And this is my toast! If you act smart I can be smarter! I swear! You let your ton...gue run! Ravuthar, bring the document Accept you wanted a bribe to take my son in the team Sign it I'll lose my job But if you don't sign, you'll die Is that okay? SIGN NOW! There are 1000 ways to come up for people with money But for poor people to climb the ladder there are only 1 or 2 avenues like sports You get your hands dirty in that too? Not only my son Names of all the talented players should be on that list before 10:00 a.m tomorrow If not... ...this document will go where it should reach! Hey! Sh...Sharma Don't take this lightly thinking you'll only lose your job I'll finish you off in a totally different level Chee! Get lost Money earned by aiming at someone's sorrow It will never help in times of danger! Walk out in your underwear His son will come to Delhi I'll draw my claws then I'll disgrace him to death over there You are here now It's my turn to be quits You want to resign? Go ahead The balance account ...I can settle with your team My father did a damn good job of disgracing you That too in a loo, huh? Mass appeal! I thought it may be quite boring to suit up and act as the coach Only when a villain enters, it becomes a different ball game altogether Let the girls play in the ground Shall we begin our game outside, my dear man? I'll be with the girls And win the cup After that I'll close your chapter 'What?' I'm out of touch with football for the past 4 or 5 years But my lined-up blows are in a soooper flow! Just because you are here and in power, if you play dirty games I can play better than you Do you get it? What- He got scared stiff just hearing me speak You have only seen Rayappan's moves But you haven't seen Michael Rayappan back in the groove Simply earth-shattering! "Fan-atic fury Mono maniac flurry" - Nessi, ball - 'Yes, sir' Hello, we told you not to come Weren't you humiliated enough? Get out now A bet match between us, okay? Not singles 1 vs 11 You 11 girls And me all by myself I'll score 3 goals It's enough if you score just 1 goal If you win, I'll leave not only this ground, but I'll go back home In case I win... ...you will have to do only what I say after that Bet? Vembu, are you scared? Pandiyamma, ready? Nessi...? "For my team over-enthusiasm" Selvi "Fanaticism to the maximum" Mari, take it Jenny, don't lose it "Eagerness with a fiery fervor" 1 more chance Thendral Mari...Mari Cha! Last chance Look there A white crow flies over there Fall for his trick! Come...come...come on! "Maniacal forever" Sorry "Fan-atical moments" Training starts at 5:00 a.m tomorrow - Coach won't agree - He's here Good morning, coach - Good morning, coach - I can't hear! - Good morning, coach - Not loud enough - Good morning, coach - LOUDER! Good morning, coach Good morning, coach Good morning, coach Good morning, coach I can't hear Louder! - Good morning, coach - That's better Can any of you tell me the score in yesterday's 1st match? Manipur 3 and we scored 0, coach Reason for this defeat? Whose mistake? Mari and Shobi didn't man mark in the center The ball will be missed What do you expect, coach? Coach, wing back Nivedha also allowed the ball inside 'Swathi didn't cover the striker' She cut her striker and scored the goal Coach, I was man blocked Thendral was in shooting range So I passed the ball to her She could have shot it herself I didn't expect her to pass it to me Coach, defence is not in shape So I couldn't see the ball That is their mistake So- - You all played very well, right? - Yes, coach Let's start the session You have to hit the ball in any of the 4 targets here If any one of you misses it... ...you must run 10 straights You must run from this goal-line to the opposite goal line 10 times, got it? Yes, coach Running 10 times isn't for only the person who missed it Entire team Is that clear? Coach...! Is - that - clear? - Yes, coach - Ready? 10 straights Next 10 straights Next Next 10 straights Listen- Donald Next Thendral, I can't do this, hit it Good Next Next You missed the 1st 4 kicks Scored goals with all the subsequent kicks How is it, captain? No, coach Team ran 40 straights already If I miss, the entire team has to run Tough deal, coach Correct! When you played only for yourself, you couldn't do it But when you played for the team, you were able to do it That is the team spirit, you idiot! Don't play for the name on the back of your t-shirt! Play for your homeland etched in your heart Every goal you score is ...not your individual glory It is team effort Goal of your audience who is supporting you Our State's goal Now tell me who was responsible for losing to Manipur? - We were only responsible, coach - I can't hear All of us, coach - Loudly - ALL OF US, COACH! End of session, disperse - Nessi...! - Coach What will you do after 10:00 p.m? Like everyone I'll booze and sleep Come to my room Group studies, huh? Yes...? Hey madcap! What is this? Like the film 'Ghajini' You've stuck Sticky notes all over the place How did you reach that height? You've even scribbled on all the walls Tell me This is our players' squad for our next match Why are those 2 places alone empty? Anitha, Gayatri Are they new players? Bringing them over? Key players who have been playing for this team for the past 3 years To be even more clear Like Virat Kohli and Dhoni of our Indian Cricket team Then why didn't they come to Delhi? The same problem faced by every woman who wants to achieve We will both go to Chennai and find out Until I'm back Do I have to coach this team? Right? It's enough if you don't disturb them I called just to inform you You mean 'Zip my lips Don't let words slip' It's alright My husband's classmates - Vanakkam - Good morning Coffee Your uncle is bathing Ask him to come down soon Okay, 'chithi' Chithi, your husband is here Morning Sorry, I don't really remember you Which batch are you? Sorry I kind of lied to get into your house I am not your schoolmate Then you are- I am Michael Tamil Nadu Women's Football team coach Okay What do you want? Your wife is a football player Are you aware of that? She said so once long ago Apparently she played in the State level or District level Hockey or volleyball? She is Tamil Nadu State team's Key player! Our team is now in Delhi for National Championship A player like Gayatri ...is extremely essential for our team now I understand what you're asking of me But I don't know how you think it is reasonable Sir, if your wife ...dressed in the shortest of shorts runs in front of 1000 ogling eyes Will you be able to accept it, huh? We belong to an orthodox family We are highly respected in our neighborhood My akka, busy making rice fritters has passed her IAS exam But she's a stay at home mother My sister-in-law doesn't work We think there is no need whatsoever for our ladies to be sent to work, sir But you on the other hand ...want our womenfolk to run in the grounds clad in shorts for the world to watch! Do you think I'm wrong? Give it some thought - I'll take this - Take it Gayatri, I want coffee Make it strong May I know where you're working, sir? Automobile engineer in TVS Was that your ardent dream? Yes, I scored 97% I topped my batch in IIT Isn't your father a successful businessman? Why didn't you follow in his footsteps? That is my father's business This is my passion See, I don't wish to be seen as Bala's son What I achieve as Sudarshan is what matters! Correct, sir Presenting yourself as Bala's son If you feel it's true you lose your individuality Introducing herself as Sudarshan's wife Gayatri may lose her identity Didn't that occur to you, sir? Is passion only male specific? Shouldn't it apply to women? That too, is it completely inapplicable to married women? If you think a man's duty is to only buy jasmine, sari, jewelry for his wife I'm so sorry, sir One who finds out her cherished dream and helps her realize it He is the perfect husband You are quite the 'engineer'! You have a State player and IAS officer to cook and do all the chores for you This isn't a mere flight ticket This is the entry ticket for your wife's dream to come true You decide what you want to do, sir Sudarshan You can't run from this Neither can you hide Gayatri is watching It's 3 months since I myself saw Anitha April 7th She left saying she was going for her match practice - Bye, ma - Bye 'Selvi, Minnoli Shoot it to Minnoli' [honking] Anitha Why is he hounding you? What's his problem? Shall I ask him what he wants? Wait, let me find out Do you get what I am saying? I'm not the girl you think I am How many times should I explain? I've been following you for the past 2 years You're acting so pricey! I love you with all my heart Why the hell don't you understand, di? Don't think you can call me 'di' with over familiarity and scant respect! One can profess her love only if she likes that person? I'm begging you Please don't disturb me Please Football is my breath That is my dream That is my only life I don't intend thinking of anything else What the hell, di?! All this temerity because you look good?! Let me see how you follow your dream with this face!
