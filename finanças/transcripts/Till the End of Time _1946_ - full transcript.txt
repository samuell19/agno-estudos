Line up on the corridor. This way, men. Line up along the corridor. Place your stuff right here. I don't know where most of you guys were on VJ day. For one reason or another you are here today. You are being discharged. Before you know it you'll be home. What the Corporal is giving you now is your master schedule. Showing you what group you are in. And where that group has got to be at what hour. Group 1. Sound off. McConnell. Marks. Harding. Ramsay. Curran. Tabeshaw. Condon. Harper. Bassett. Name? Tabeshaw. William J. 840067. Guadalcanal, Saipan and Iwo Jima, right? That's right. Silver star. Purple heart. Hospitalised New Zealand. Skull trepanned and silver plate inserted. They put that gizmo in my head to keep my brains where they belong. You feel okay? With this hunk of silver and a real dime I can always get a cup of coffee. Name? Harper. Clifford W. 976955. You got the same action record as Tabeshaw's. We've been together since boot camp in Diego. Better than three years. Three years nine months. Four battle stars and a silver star. We parted company when he was dumb enough to get himself shot. Why don't you own up, Harper? I was a big hero and you were a coward. As soon as I find out about your education and military specialities .. I'll pass you on to rehab section. Are you going back to truck driving? You don't work as an MP for two years and then go back to truck driving. I am going to be a cop. The rehabilitation officer nearest you is in New Orleans. Here is his name and address if you want his help. Maybe you will find things changed. I don't need help. I am going to buy me a farm. Very little ever changes on a farm, mister. After you leave me you go to the Red Cross. That is important to you because there is where you file claim to a pension. That silver plate in your skull entitles you to a pension. You don't think I am going to charge somebody for that, do you? Lots of men say that, Corporal. But you file that claim with the Red Cross anyway. Did you sign for this insurance when you went in? Between now and the next year and a half you'll have to convert that policy. In the meantime .. Don't forget to pay your premiums. - Don't worry. I won't. You left college in the middle of your freshman year, huh? Right after Pearl Harbor. You are going back to school, I suppose? Well, I hadn't thought about it. Let's see. You worked for your father one summer in the construction business, didn't you? I was getting primed for football. It might be a good idea of you to take some engineering courses. Maybe. But first I want to get home. You and me both, Mack. Tabeshaw? - Here. Total: $455.97. Back pay is $387.42. Railway fare to Stinking Creek New Mexico at 5-cents a mile is $68.55. A hundred dollars mustering-out pay. We give you the first hundred now. The second is mailed from Washington to your home in thirty days. The third hundred 30 days after that. - So you can't blow it all at once, huh? That is the skinny, Corporal. - Count it, Mack. Are you kidding? Tabeshaw. Your discharge button, your honorable discharge and an envelope to keep it in. Thank you, sir. - Good luck, Tabeshaw. Keep the change. Hi, Cliff. Hi. What is your name? I am Freddy Stewart. Freddy Stewart? Why, the last time I saw you, you were this high. Now I am this high. - You sure are. So long. - So long. Hi. Your folks aren't home. Your father is playing golf and your mother is out shopping with my mother. I'm sure they'll be positively grim .. When they discover you came back from the wars and they weren't here. Welcome home. What do you like to be called? Leatherneck? Marine or devil dog? 'Marine' suits me fine. Just plain marine. Okay, marine. I am Helen Ingersoll. We are your next-door neighbors. What happened to the Cranshaws? They moved north to Alameda three years ago. Lucky for us too. Because when daddy transferred here from Detroit we didn't have a place to live. Daddy is production manager at Lockheed. And although we could have got into war housing, we thought maybe .. But you are bored, aren't you? No. Go ahead. I am interested in people. Especially our new neighbors. We'll be your neighbors for a long time too. Daddy says southern California is the coming part of the country. Daddy says that six out of every ten veterans will settle here after the war. Daddy says that .. - Never mind about your daddy. Haven't you got any ideas of your own? For a returned marine I have got some super ideas. Anything I can help you with? No thanks. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye. What will it be, chum? Don't 'chum' me you four-eyed little square. Cliff. Cliff Harper. Well, Cliff. You are back. You are back from the thing. - I sure am, Scuffy. Well, well. Say. You did alright, chum. You did fine. - You did alright yourself. Why, when I left here this was nothing but a candy and ice-cream parlor. La Guerre, chum. La Guerre. That is French for 'The war', chum. The war. Yes. What with all the rationing and the liquor licence I finally got .. I'd have been a creep not to jump on the gravy train. Good going. Give me a rum and coke. Are you all in one piece? Yes, sir. I am rigged as good as the day we took the city championship away from Fairfax. Boy, I will never forget that one. No, Chum. Your money buys nothing here. Until tomorrow. Well, thanks. Glad you are back, chum. See your kisser? Yeah. Where did you get it? I mailed your ma for it. Hey. I am right next to Pinky. Not only is he a Lieutenant senior grade. Having distinguished himself as a naval flier. But he is sitting right in that booth over there. Hey, Pinky. Look what the marines threw back. Cliff. How are you? You are home. - Yeah. When did you get in? - Just got off the train. This is Cliff Harper. - Hello. These are a pair of tired old crumbs. I've made them even more tired by telling them what a big hero I am. Hey, grab it. - Thanks. How was it, Cliff? It was alright. How as it with you? Upstairs it was fine. The minute I got back to the flight deck it nearly drove me nuts. Yes. I'll bet. If you gents aren't careful you are going to get maudlin. Pat Ruscomb - this is Cliff Harper. Hello. Don't let the uniform fool you, Pat. He is a civilian. You are on terminal leave? - I'm in for the duration. The duration of the peace. If they start another war, brother, I am resigning. I have enough points to get out but I like the navy. You know, I wanted the navy even before the war. That's the kind of guy I am. Any idea where they will send you? There is a new carrier been commissioned that I'm bucking for. I'd have been out of these today but my clothes don't fit. Going back to school? I don't know. Maybe. That is one thing I will miss. But I'll be getting back more often to see you guys and shoot it with you. I know I want to. Let's dance. Alright. Are you with Pinky? With nobody. Pinky didn't bring you? I drove over by myself. But I am driving you home. You know that, huh? - Uhuh. You told me. When? When you sat down next to me. Do you want to say goodbye to them? I'll say goodbye tomorrow. This is it. A bit on the elegant side, but home. I share it with a friend of mine who works for the government. Not bad. I thought it would work out pretty well. Having someone around all the time. So far, she's been in Washington for the last three months. Uhuh. That gives you a little more room, huh? Uhuh. Is this your home town? Yep. Glad to be home? Uhuh. Marines are .. Kind of rugged, huh? Yep. Well, that is fine. Now, what do we talk about? Not much of a talker. Come here. What if I don't? You will. I liked it. I've got to tell you something. It's true. When I saw you, funny things happened. I couldn't wait to put my arms around you. Don't be frightened. It isn't love. I don't think so. What is it? Lots of things. Growing up. Six, eight, ten months in the Pacific. A jukebox joint. And then a room that's not too crowded. All those things. Half of them is enough. You are pretty grown up. For a kid your age. If you are laughing at me I don't like it. I am sorry. Who is Flash Gordon? His name is John Ruscomb. First Lieutenant AEF. 8th Bomber Command. Who is he? My husband. If you hadn't had his picture here .. I don't think I'd care one way or the other whether you were married or not. But this way .. I don't like me and I don't like you. Great. Where is he? They. Buried him in France. They sent me the name of the place about three weeks ago. I .. You are sorry. I am sorry too. Sit down. I .. Met John about three years ago. I was a hostess at the canteen and he was a cadet. It happened like that. I went around with him until he got his wings and his assignment to go overseas. And away he went. Out into the wild blue yonder. It is very corny but true. That's what makes it so corny. It has happened to so many. The last letter I got from him he had made a second mission. The C.O. told me that he was killed on his third. He has been dead about fourteen months. They sent me a package. With some of his personal things in it. But I never opened it. I sent it to his family. They live in Louisville. They ought to give purple hearts for war widows. You are sweet. I will see you again. I want to kiss you goodbye. But the room is too crowded. Goodbye, Cliff. Goodbye, Pat. Cliff. - Dad. How are you, son? - I am okay. Where have you been? - I left a note for you. We called Scuffys. You weren't there. Your mother is nearly crazy waiting for you. Why didn't you let us know? I thought I'd surprise you, dad. You look mighty fit, son. - I feel great too. Amy. Amy, he is here. She has been crying ever since she got home. Imagine that. Cliff. My boy. - Ma. Oh, my boy. You are home. Thank god. Thank god. He is home for good, Amy. Be a good girl and don't carry on so. You are thin. - Thin? He is thirty-two pounds heavier than when he left here. I felt just awful when I saw your note. I could have killed myself for going shopping this afternoon. But we're having company for a barbecue tonight and I had to get some things. Well, it was kinda spooky coming home and not finding anyone around. How does it look, Cliff? Does it look the same to you? Fine, ma. It looks just fine. You are not tired after your trip? - No. I am alright. I guess you're old enough to handle this now, son. I've been saving this bourbon for when you got home. Say when. Clifford. CW, do you want to make him sick? Women don't understand us fighting men, son. Glad to have you back from the wars. Glad to be back. I guess after that G.I. food you will enjoy home cooking. I sure will, ma. But I've got so much to talk about I don't know where to begin. I want to tell you where I've been, what I saw .. Don't talk about it, Cliff. I know you don't want to talk about it. It's sure great to have you home, son. Now you two hurry and get washed up. Company will be here before you know it. That is the last club you will get. Is this the bag you wanted, ma? - Yes. Sure. There we are. How you doing, dad? Fine, son. Fine. If he gives me one of these .. And I have this left. I go down. You see? Do you want a cold drink or something, Clifford? No thanks, ma. I am alright. - That's fine, dear. Did you play gin in the marines, Cliff? No, Mr Ingersoll. Mostly Acey Deucey. Sometimes a little poker. In the last show CW and I had a boy in our company. A fellow named Scotty Blodgett. He knocked off over $60,000 shooting crap in Paris. What's the matter with the kids in this war, Cliff? Nobody gambles? - There was a little of it, I guess. I left a note for him that I would be over here. Who? I told you. Tommy Hendricks. He is taking me to the dance tonight. He is her steady. - Father. You wouldn't be in the mood to treat me to a drink, would you? Yes, ma'am. How is one? I think you are safe. - I have three. You get fourteen. In spite of what your old man tells you that is the way to play gin, my boy. I takes it as is. What? No glass chaser? - Just neat. Hi. - Where have you been? Well, I couldn't get my car started. That is, right away. Cliff, this is Tommy Hendricks. Tommy - Cliff Harper. Hiya, Tommy. - How are you, sir? Do you think we will make it? Relax, Tommy. I'll need a wrap. Tommy, would you mind stepping through the hedge and getting it for me? Sure. - Thank you. We could be more comfortable. Smoke? I am dying for one, but .. My father. You know. Yeah. I know. My folks were like that too when I was your age. I am not so young. This thing needs oiling. What it needs is using. I've been waiting three and half years to sit here and use this. Oiling or no oiling. Was it rugged? Was what rugged? The war. You know. Yep. Got to get some oil tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sunday. You mean today started this morning? - Sure. It started at .. You want to go to the beach tomorrow? - Tomorrow I sleep. I honestly don't think I can take this any longer, kid. It's making me seasick. I thought that the marines were good on land or sea. I am an ex-marine. Here you are. Well, I'm happy to have met you, sir. - Same here, Tommy. Have a good time. - We sure will, sir. Yes, sir. Goodnight, Cliff. I am the dummy. Ma, if you don't tell anybody I won't. I saw you and Helen over by the swing together. Yeah. The Ingersolls are nice people. - They seem to be alright. Helen can cook and sew and is wonderful in the garden. Ad she's very smart in school. - How is her knitting? She will be a sophomore next term at USC and she made a very good sorority. Amy darling. - Yes, dear? We made three hearts and rubber. That is wonderful, dear. We'll talk some more about it, son. We have so much to talk about. How are you doing, son? - I guess I'll hit the sack, dad. Alright, son. It's been a long day. Goodnight, dad. Goodnight, everybody. - Goodnight. Goodnight, ma. - Goodnight, son. Goodnight Cliff. The poor kid is bushed. Remember the day we got out? We didn't stop celebrating for 72 hours. Hi. - Hiya, sailor. What gives? My folks had a barbecue last night. It turned out to be a homecoming. I had one of those things. It turned out to be murder. Half of them were afraid if they said anything it would upset me. The other half were afraid if I said something I would upset them. Look, my friend. Let's face it. Nobody is going to listen to us. Let's take off an hour and you tell me what you did and I tell you what I did. You got it. In the meantime let us turn our talents to something gainful. Want to go skating? I haven't had a pair of skates on in four years. I have got a date with Pat. Pat who? The girl you took out of Scuffys yesterday without saying goodbye to me. Oh. That girl. Grab yourself a date. I'll pick you up in an hour. I'll try to think of somebody. Goodbye. What do you mean, goodbye? I'm picking you up in an hour. Goodbye for yesterday. Hey, do you skate? Do you skate? Why, natch. Hi. - Hi. Hi. He said he'd get somebody. He did. Well, she is cute. Hey, aren't you going to the beach with me? I am so sorry, Tommy. Something terribly important has come up and I just can't go today. And get some clothes on. He is such a child. Helen Ingersoll - Pat Ruscomb. Hello, Pat. Everything alright with you? - Everything is fine with me. You guys? - Aye-aye, sir. Where do you get the skates? - Over this way. I'll get them. Size three for me. Figure skates. Are you in the Sonia Henie department too? You a flat foot? - I'm coming with you. Give me a pair of figures for a girl size 3. A pair for a girl size 6. A 10 for me, and you sir? Make mine size 11. Figure skates. I'm one of those hot kids. - The girls seem to get along alright. Pat can take care of herself anywhere anytime. Skip the details. Just tell me. Is she is or is she ain't your girl? Pat is nobody's girl but Johnny's. What you mean is, she's not yours. Me for the life of the bounding main, my friend. I don't figure. Carry on. Anybody who can't do this is grounded. Hiya, fellahs. Ever do much skating, Mrs Ruscomb? Yes and no. I had to be careful when I firsts got on ice. You can get an awful rash on your back. - Why? Why don't one of you fellows help Mrs Ruscomb? That's me. They all laughed when I sat down to skate. Very neat. I know. I feel so old when she calls me Mrs Ruscomb. Come on. Let's try it. She doesn't need any help at all. Watch me. Coffee? Two coffees please. Where did you learn to skate like that? In a little town you've never heard of. In Wisconsin. Tell me. I'll look it up on the map. Ready? Ready. - Chippewa Falls. Chippewa Falls? I will remember that. - You've got enough to remember. I'm forgetting things so I'll have my room. You ought to try that sometime. I will. Sometime. Was it a lake or a river in Chippewa Falls? A river filled with deadheads. Anybody I know? A deadhead is a piece of timber that has been waterlogged. It just sits in the river with its head above water going no place. Then it is somebody I know. Excuse me a minute. Hiya, doll face. Close in, marine. I'm getting the shakes. Go ahead and shake. Thanks. Anybody looking? What if they are? Feeling better? The doctor said they would wear off in time. Once you get home and things brighten up you'll be fine. I am not going home. My folks would go nuts if they could see me like this. I couldn't take it. Where do you live, soldier? Boise, Idaho. I got a 21-day pass from the hospital. I've used up five of them already. I guess I had better check back to the hospital. You being afraid to go home reminds me of myself. My first year in high school. My first dance. My mother made my dress for me. I was so sure it was awful that every time a boy came and asked me to dance .. I made up some silly excuse. I was afraid to get out on the floor. I was afraid people would laugh. I was panicking. 'Patricia', I said to myself. This is your first dance and it is going to be your last. Unless you stop being so ridiculous. And beat this here and now. While I'm having this big argument with myself a cute little boy comes up. And asked the girl next to me. And before I knew what I was doing I grabbed him and I was dancing. And after that it was a cinch. You figure I can beat this by taking up dancing? All I am saying .. Is let them look. And if they don't like it. Let them kill themselves. Sure. Let them kill themselves. Thanks. A good job. That's us. Service with a smile. You okay? - Yeah. A good deal. I hope he does go home. You handled him well, Pat. - He is nice. The coffee is cold. I'll get some more. Never mind. Come on, let's skate. Come on, son. Rise and shine. Up and at 'em. Hit the deck. Come on. A wonderful morning. God is in heaven. All is right with the world. Knock it off. You ain't pounding that pillow all day, are you? There is work to be done. There is a world to be won. It is too early, dad. You got some mail. A man must read his mail. The same old malarkey. 'We have your post-war bungalow ready for you'. 'Today. Now'. 'Sign up for that post-war trip around the world'. 'Today. Now'. Everything has to be today. And plugs from eighteen veterans outfits. Be careful of those, son. Some of them can be bad. Ever hear of the American War Patriots? What's that? I don't know. But when you want to join up talk to me about it. When I want to join up? Gee, that's some suit. Pretty snappy, huh? I hope you charged it to me like I told you to. I've still got plenty of cash, dad. 920 bucks. I don't need your money for a long time. Thanks anyway. But .. But if you don't get started with something your money won't last forever. Know that, Cliff. How about school? It starts Monday. Made up your mind about it? I've made up my mind about one thing, dad. And that is not to make up my mind. For a while yet. Sure. Sure, Cliff. I just thought would mention it. Waffles. Why, ma. That is sensational. You always liked them. I remember one night. I forget where it was. We were in a foxhole. You don't know what a foxhole is, ma. But try to think of three fellows lying in a telephone booth. It's raining and hot and .. I don't want to upset you ma but it really stunk. I tried. To think of something that would .. Take my mind off how rugged it was. So, for no reason at all I thought of your waffles. Son, don't talk about it. Just eat. Anybody who talks about another war us out of his mind. Those foxholes sure can stink. Clifford darling, please don't lie in the past. I'm not living in the past, ma. I was just .. What is that? That is my past. Hiya, Bill. - Hiya, partner. The kid from the Quadulane. - In the flesh. How are you, Cliff? What's the word? - Everything is swell. Come on in and meet my mother. - These kids round here sure know you. You must spend all your time digging to scoop out a foxhole like this. Ma. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Bill Tabeshaw. Bill - my mother. I'm happy to know you, Bill. Thank you, ma'am. I am glad to meet Cliff's mother. Cliff is just having his breakfast. Would you like a waffle? No thanks, ma'am. But a cup of coffee would be mighty fine. Right. Go ahead and finish your chow, Cliff. Come on now. Sound off. Where have you been? How is that hunk of melon, your skull? Say, I'm getting to like it better than my own head. Well, how do you like me? You are too beautiful for Stinking Creek, New Mexico. It is nothing. Nothing that don't set you back a few months' pay. Sit down, ma. Listen to the scuttlebutt. - Thank you, ma'am. What happened in Diego? Remember I left the station to go across the street for a beer? Yeah. Coming back I am hailed a couple of .. A couple of girls that are going to Tijuana to get some nylons. You know me. I tag along. I get down there and I get picked up by two promoters who want to play red dog. I figured they've seen the gooney bird on my blouse. They know I'm loaded so .. I play them very close. I clipped them for 21 hundred fish. Hubba hubba. Still got it? I am going to keep it. I'm catching me that Grand Canyon Limited tonight. If they let a guy dressed like you on the train. Day after tomorrow I lay this dough down for some ranch and I am raising steers. Now hear this. What you got on the roster for today? You tell me. I've got to make a slight social call. Has she got a sister? This is a boy that was laying next to me in the hospital. When I got out I told him I'd play the tables. So he gave me a silver dollar for good luck. I got the luck. He gets ten percent. Are you going to sit there all day and bore my ma with the story of your life? We are going to brighten up. Ma'am, it was a pleasure to meet you. If you ever get to Stinking Creek be sure .. Thank you, Bill. I don't expect I will. I sometimes wished my ma had said that same thing years ago. Hi. Gee, do you look super. Not a brass button anywhere. You look like a dream, man. Meet the cowboy of Quadulane. Bill Tabeshaw - Helen Ingersoll. Hello Bill. - Miss Ingersoll, it's a pleasure. What are you up to? The same thing I'm up to every day about this time. Waiting for you. Haven't you got anything else to do? Want a little high-class chauffeuring? A tour of the city with some sightseeing chatter thrown in. Boy, when you marines make up your minds you make up your minds. Do you know where 1121 South Orlando is? I can't do it. I can't do it. They hurt. Come on, Perry. Give it another chance. Shall we take her? - No, honey. It won't be fun for you. Sure, Bill. Go ahead. You are a nice kid. Thanks, grandpa. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Son. You have visitors. - Bill. What do you say, partner? How are you anyway? Fine, cowboy. Ma, this is the boy who was with me in hospital. He had the bunk next to mine. How do you do. Gunny, shake hands with ex-marine corporal Bill Tabeshaw. Hiya, Gunner. Gunny Watrous. Rehabilitation office, Los Angeles. Glad to know you. PFC Cliff Harper - Mrs Kincheloe. How do you do. - Sergeant? How are you. - I am Perry Kincheloe. Hiya, Perry. - Hi there. Hi, Sergeant. Hi Perry. This is my youngest son, James. Hi fellahs. Going to work out this afternoon? You better limber up first with a little rope. Sure. I will whip it to death. - Come on, James. You are always welcome here. Drop in often, will you. Thank you, ma'am. - We will, Mrs Kincheloe. I remember seeing your papers when they came through the office, Harper. I wrote you a letter asking if we could do anything to help out. Never heard a word from you. The letters a guy gets when he's mustered out are just murder, Sergeant. It's just that everybody wants to help. I thought letter writing was a lost art. Like steer milking. Well, I've got to be getting on. I'll drop in again next week, Perry. So long, men. If you need any advice, Harper. Just look in that waste basket and fish out that letter. If I don't hear from you in forty days you will get another. Man, you are loaded. What is this for? - That's your cut. I took the silver dollar you gave me and rolled it until it show 2,100 iron men. It's mighty nice of you Bill but I don't really need it. I got me another lucky dollar. Well, turn it over, man. I'll put it to work for you. This one belongs to me. That kid is skipping rope. He is pretty good too. Young Perry I will title him. Al this year I am working on his wind and balance. Next year I will teach him timing. He'll be adding weight by then. I'll work him every year until he's 16. That's when I had my first bout. Then he'll be ready. He has got a pair of shoulders like yours. When he gets some meat behind them. And if his jaw ain't made of glass he'll be as good as I was. Somebody in this family has got to be a fighter. You ain't by any chance trying to put your life into Jimmy's, are you Perry? Why not? I got no life of my own left. - Now don't give me that. Just do what you did at the hospital. Put them on, mate. Put them on. Number one. They'd murder me. Number two. After I have got them on, what have I got? Cowboy, you have no idea what a feeling I get .. Letting my mother look at me like this. I get sick in my stomach when she has to help me in the chair. When she has to .. Lift me back in the bed. I'm twenty-one and I'm dead. Now listen, dummy. I'm pulling out for steak and beer tonight. But when I get back I want to see you with those legs on .. I want see you kicking them around like you were born with them. Do you hear me? Got you, Bill. That is what the man said. Have a nice trip. Semper fidelis. Drop around again, mate. - I'll be by, Perry. I'll be here. I owe this to Perry. I borrowed it from him at the hospital. Well .. are you sure? Ma'am, that's 200 dollars there. I would not be giving it to you unless I'm sure. Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Kincheloe. - Goodbye, Mr Harper. How are you, chums? How are you, Scuffy? Cliff. Hello. What will you have? Rum and coke. Go on. Tell the man. Make it the same, Scuffy. Now please. You know the law. Come on, Scuffy. I've been eighteen since last March. Well, you come back in about three years. And bring your birth certificate too. Right now, no rum. A bourbon and ginger ale. A bourbon and ginger ale. A rum and coke. Come back in three years. You know, Bill. That Perry. He is never going to put on those legs. And what he says makes sense. That is what rocks you. You know, when I left him up at Mare Island he was coming along. I guess it's because there was thousands of guys around us in the same fix. The war was still on. It was like when we hit the beaches. Yeah. We were a team. Everybody together. There was a guy next to you you could depend on. You didn't know where you were going but it was the same place. So what difference did it make? Well, now we are civilians again. Rugged individuals. There is nobody to tell us what to do or when to do it. We're on our own. Perry, you, me. All of us. Well, we've been gabbing for it. Now we got it. What are you doing? I've been driving you fellows on your business. This is my business. How is business? Which one of you is the lucky one? No. I am staying. Come on, Cliff. Okay. I brought you one of our very best rum-less cokes. I need a little courage. Come on. I'll bring you up to date. Cliff Harper. You've been holding out on me. Cliff, you make the rest of them look like novices. You should have seen me when I was young. Come on. Let's have another one. Any nickels? Say, not bad at all. - Yes, sir. You kids are really groovy. You're next Bill whether you like it or not. He's an old man, Helen. Let him have his drink in peace. Hey. I didn't pick that. There must be somebody ahead of you. Hi, Pat. - Hi. You're a good dancer. A girl always makes me look good. You'll wear yourself out doing that all afternoon. I haven't been doing it all afternoon. - No? Where have you been, to the beach? Making a bad social call. Anybody I know? You don't want to know him. - You can't tell. I know many people. What about tonight? No good for tonight. I like your new clothes. I'll get used to them. - Do you like my new dress? I can't see anything but your eyes. Are you sure about tonight? I am pretty sure. Hiya, Pat. Very sure. Hello. Captain Winthrop - ex-marine Harper. How do you do. - How are you, Captain? I will see you later. Who's the babe, Clifford? - My best friend. No, no. A man's best friend is his mother. Pardon me. - Where you going? I just remembered a previous engagement I had. Thanks for the chauffeuring, Helen. Well, I got to shove. What is she mad about? When she brightens up you can write me a long letter. You can also write me when you get rid of that heartburn. Will you take my advice and get yourself some traveller's checks for that dough? I will be alright. You figure this heap will last until the Union Station? Well, it did yesterday. Keep pushing, Bill. Take it easy, Clifford. Be good. Oh, mother. Come on, come on. Let the Carters wait five minutes. Clifford, where have you been? Out. Aren't you going to say good evening, son? Sorry dad. Good evening. - That's better. Son, you ought to call your mother when you are not coming home .. Instead of letting her worry her head off. Sorry, ma. I just didn't think. That is one of your troubles, Clifford. You never do much thinking. Lay off me, will you ma. Are you sick, Clifford? - No. I am alright. Your father and I would like to talk to you a moment. Sure. Go ahead, dear. Cliff. Your mother and I haven't been seeing much of you lately. We'd just like to ask you where you have been. And if you are happy. What father is trying to say Clifford is we are disappointed in your behaviour. Why are you disappointed? Well, you come home, grab a bite to eat and then you are off again. I suppose you are gallivanting around with boys like this Bill Tabeshaw and .. I doubt it's the sort of company .. Tabeshaw is my buddy, ma. The only guy that .. Cliff. What your mother is trying to say is that since you've been back we are .. Well .. just haven't been able to .. Well son, it is just not like old times. Maybe that is because old times is three and half years ago, dad. I know you are both sore at me. Because I didn't go back to school. Maybe you're annoyed as I haven't done anything else but I'm not ready yet. That's all. But we had other plans. Plans about the present. About your future. Maybe I have to make my own plans about the future, ma. I think I'll have a beer and hit the sack. There is a cold plate in the icebox for you, dear. You'll feel better later, Cliff. Come over to the Carters. Thanks. Are you alright? - Sorry. I am fine. I am sorry. I must be very, very hammered. You are okay. Goodnight Captain. - Night. I've had a wonderful evening. Officer, there is a man following me. Have a cigarette. Have a drink. Well, have something. I thought I told you I was going to be busy tonight. So, you are busy. So. I was busy. What do you want to see me about? I can say it all in a minute. Fine. I'll time you. You are a tramp. That leaves you just forty seconds. [ Buzzer ] Hot coffee. If I'd wanted coffee I would have made it. Well, you still owe me forty seconds. I don't owe you anything. Except for the price of that coffee. If you tell me how much it was I'll pay you and you can get out of here. Come on. Drink this. I'll tell you how I got my silver star. I don't want to know anything about you. Take a sip and then I will go. I am sorry I called you that. I came back to tell you. That's very nice of you. Very generous. I know I shouldn't have acted the way I did, but .. I was beginning to think of you as my girl. Try to see it my way. You are smart, Pat. Of course I am smart. And lots of smart girls like me. We had a choice to make and we made it. My John married me because .. When he went to war he wanted to be able to dream of home. That is why I married him. I wanted him to have that dream. The thing I didn't count on was that at the end of the war .. John's coming home would be my dream. And the war is over. And John isn't coming home. And I am stuck with my dream. 'Patricia', I said to myself. 'This is your first dance'. 'And it's going to be your last'. 'Unless you stop being so ridiculous'. 'And beat this here and now'. That's what the girl said to the soldier, Pat. That is exactly what she said. Cliff. Yep? Could I have a cigarette? What did you want to see me about? I am lonesome. There are too many people in this town. And you have got to be lonesome for me? Does that make sense? A lot of things don't make sense. For instance. Why was I so burned up when I saw you with that captain? That captain was John's co-pilot. He is on terminal leave passing through town on his way home. Yeah. And. We talked about John. And France. He told me so many things about John I had wanted to know. Somehow. Just for a moment. He almost seemed to be John. Is that alright? Yes. It's alright. Pat. I am lonesome. There is nobody. Nobody? My pal left for home. Helen doesn't talk my kind of talk. And my folks. What is the matter with your folks? I don't know. I don't know what is the matter with me either. We just don't seem to get along. Do you know why you are lonesome? You have got nothing to do. You've got no interests. What are you, a blank? No. I mean. Work or a job. What kind of a job? I don't know. What have you ever done? Go to school. Go to war. Have you ever tried working? Can you keep a secret? 'Keep-a-secret Ruscomb'. That's what they call me at the club. I tried working. Half a day at a filling station. And half a day at J.C. Roberts. Men's clothing. You were too good for them. No. They were swell jobs. Someone else got them and was going great. It is me that is wrong. I guess I just don't fit in any place yet. What about your father's office? Too easy. Maybe later. What do you do, Pat? Ever since August 14. Radios, recording machines, phonographs. Do you think I could get in there? We are hiring veterans every day. You are a vet. You get the job. It would be nice being close to you all the time. Would it? You know what I am talking about. You know what I am thinking about. I think I will go to work. Monday. That is a nice, clean decision. Try and make it last. Through the day. Not me. I'm not joining anything. What have they got to offer? - I don't know. Some of those veterans organisations have done some pretty good things. I guess they have. So many new ones have come along I don't know which is good and which is lousy. I got a pitch last night from one outfit called American War Patriots. Ever catch them? - Not yet. But they will get to me. They all do. Why can't the girls put the transformers together so a guy can check them right? There is another reject. "Ben Hartman report to personnel." "Ben Hartman report to personnel." You've been rejecting a lot of good material, Harper. I call them as I see them. Try it now. What was wrong? You are off two degrees. - Oh. Okay. Why not take ten minutes for a smoke, Harper? This heat digs into everybody. I've been in hotter places. I know, Harper. If I hadn't been .. I'd have been sitting at this bench working at it for three years. And I would be as good as you. Better, I think. Quit riding me. I'm not riding you, Harper. I am trying not to. I don't need any help from you. If fighting would help any, I'd take you on. Hi. Coffee. Black. Give me another one. What's driving you to drink, Cliff? I will tell you. It is the needles on the test tubes. You see .. they were off two degrees. Oh, Cliff. I made a dummy out of myself. The foreman tried to straighten me out on something and .. I got sore at him. Well, you are over it. He'll forget about it. I've been thinking. I will listen. Okay. Okay. I am back from the war. I am lucky. I've got two arms, two legs and two eyes. Right? Right. - Right. Nine out of ten fellows coming home are going to be in the same shape. Uhuh. Normal. Normal. Then what is burning me up? I am edgy. I feel out of things. Do you know why? Tell me and we'll both know. Because I have been scrounged. I am robbed out of three and a half years. Somebody stole my time. Look, Cliff. You can't twist up the rest of your life worrying about lost time. I know that. I know that but if I had been in school .. Maybe I would have an engineering degree. I might even have made a good fraternity. You made a good fraternity. With fourteen million members. Well, I had to be doing something. I am near you. That's not much to make a career over. What about going to the beach tonight? As soon as we finish. Sounds good. - Okay. Anything else? - No. I've had enough. I'm glad to see that stuff isn't getting to you. "Adele Jensen. Call purchasing." "Adele Jensen. Call purchasing." Hey, Hal. Yeah, Harper? I should have kept my eyes on that tester. You've got a beef but I can't help you square it. Only time can. Don't let that bench get you down. After you learn every part of a radio we will likely transfer you someplace else. Sure. I must start somewhere. - You're doing okay. "Cliff Harper. You are wanted in the superintendent's office." I'll see you. Hello Harper. Remember me? Sure, Sergeant. Well, you kept your promise. I got that second letter from you. I didn't answer because .. I have been pretty busy. - Yeah. You are doing alright. On the level? No squawks? - Of course not. You've been out of the Marine Corps a few weeks. It's kinda tough getting yourself reorganised. Indoor work but .. You will make out. These people here know what you are up against. 80 percent of their men are veterans. - And good guys. No. You are no problem. But I would like to talk to you about my problem. One of them anyway. What? Remember Perry? Yeah. I'd be a problem too if I had both my legs amputated. I will only be a minute. - Take two. Hiya, Cliff. How you doing? Hello, Mr Harper. - Hello, Mrs Kincheloe. How would you boys like some nice cold iced-tea? It's hot enough for anything cold. Jimmy, go and help ma. Don't let me break it up. Did you ever punch bag? No. But I have always wanted to. What have you heard from Tabeshaw? - Not a word. If you're going to do it you might as well do it right. The idea is to keep it going. Keep your eye on the one spot and hit the centre of the bag. So you're sure to meet it as it comes to you. Go ahead. Try it. Say, this is alright. You ought to teach this stuff, Perry. I mean to a lot of people. Gunny sent you? Yeah, he did. He sent me some books to read about being a playground instructor. Did you read them? How can I teach kids games? - You are teaching Jimmy. I can't teach him footwork. You could if you'd put on those legs they gave you. They hurt. Look, Perry. You aren't doing yourself or anyone else any good by refusing to lick this thing. Maybe. Why didn't Gunny dell me this himself? He thought if he said it, it would be official. I got nothing against topside. But if Gunny shows me a book teaching me how to win boxing matches with no legs. I will read it. No good? I guess I made it even worse. How was it? - Too wet. Water will never hurt you. You like? I think I will just do this for the rest of my life. Have me rub your back? That. Live on the beach and swim. Lay on the sand in front of a fire. Yes, sir. That's what I am going to do. Pat. This is the best time I've had since I've been home. Why shouldn't I keep on doing it? - You might get lonesome yet. Nearly everybody else has something to do. I won't be lonesome. I will be with you. You are my girl. I am your girl. Well then, it is all settled. We live on the beach until our dough runs out. And then? Then we'll be all straightened out. We'll go back to work. The foreman will still be there. Perry still won't wear his legs. That has got nothing to do with it. I just feel good here doing this. I want it to last. Pat. What about us getting married? - Go on. Me to you. You to me. Pat. I am levelling. You just think you want to marry me. I know. - You are sure? Positive. That is good. Because that's is the only thing you are positive about. I know what I want. You are lucky. I don't know what I want. You must have some idea. I don't think my idea of heaven .. Is to be married to a guy who wants to lie around on a beach until he's broke. Okay. If you don't like my idea of heaven, what is yours? I don't know. Sometimes I think that if I do get married again .. I'd like to marry a guy who can make things easy for me. Someone who can deliver a 20-room house .. And thinks that a 16-cylinder car is for bringing home the groceries. Someone who doesn't yell when I hire a nurse for each one of the kids he wants. You make me feel like a cheap pick-up. I am not talking about you, Cliff. I am talking about me. You ask me what I think about and sometimes I do think about security. I don't mean the kind of man I was talking about. But. If I do get married again. I think I'd like to end up with more than just a gold star and nothing else. But until then? I .. Live on velvet. Where do I fit in? You are the velvet. Darling. - Let's take off. Cliff. Yeah? Aren't you going to kiss me goodnight? Goodnight. Gee, Helen. I didn't know you .. How dare you. Hello, Cliff. Hi, Bill. What are you doing here? I just breezed into town. I thought I'd look you up. Why didn't you wait in the house? - I came to call on you, not your folks. Careful, you'll get your hand caught. I need twenty bucks. Are you in any trouble? For twenty dollars you want the story of my life? You look awful. You look cute. Come on in the house and we'll have a beer. It ain't polite to drink and run. Who are you running to? You're asking too many questions, Cliff. Bill. Level with me. What is the matter with you? Bill. My head. It's busting wide open. I've had these headaches for weeks. Sometimes it's better. Sometimes like now. Always there is pressure. It's like clamps on my skull. Why not go to the veterans hospital? My folks don't know about the silver plate. I don't want to worry them. Go on in the house. I'll get a doctor. - No. I've got a better idea. I have 20 bucks. Let me buy you a drink. I'll get the car keys and take you to the V.A. hospital. Will you stop talking about the V.A. hospital? Come on, Cliff. Let me buy you that drink. Okay. Maybe a drink will do us both some good. A couple of drinks. That is for me. You got any pain now? I haven't felt better since I've been off the force. Me too, Bill. Now hear this. Tomorrow morning I take you to the V.A. hospital. Nah. I got better plans. I get me some dough and I go back looking for another ranch. Whatever happened to that two thousand dollars you left here with? Ever hear of a town called Vegas? Yeah. Brother, that has fouled me up but good. Come on, cowboy. All of it. Well. I get to Vegas with the dough. I figure five thousand dollars will buy me better land and more stock than two. That's right? - That's right. I get in a game. I play. I lose. Flat. So I ask the house for a goodbye drink. A little while later three guys come and toss me out of the joint. I land on the back of my head. It starts to hurt. Didn't you ever get to Stinking Creek? Sure. I hired out as a cowhand. But my head started driving me crazy. So I thumbed my way west. Now, I get me some more dough and I .. Go someplace else. I've got some money at home. 700 dollars. What has your 700 got to do with me? Look. As soon as we get your head fixed up. Which we do first thing in the morning. Maybe I'll go into ranching with you. You've never even been on a horse. - I can learn. That would be a good deal. It ought to be kinda nice working with an ex-buddy. Maybe we could work Perry in on it some way too. That is a good idea. But I'm not going to the hospital. This will stop by itself. You are no doctor. Then the deal is off. I get it. You're just saying all this to get me to go to the hospital. You don't know what you are talking about. It will be swell having Perry with us. I'll call Perry and tell him right now. Let me. I will be right here at the pinball machine. Hello? Hello, Mr Harper. Cliff. Yes he is. Just a moment. Thanks, ma. Greetings, Mack. Perry, listen. Tabeshaw is in town. And it's not good. That silver plate in his skull has been acting up. But he won't let me take him to the hospital. Look. Can you call that rehab Sergeant Gunny Watrous .. And ask him to come over here and give me a hand. Why, sure. Give me the address. It is The Swan Club on Western Avenue. And tell him to hurry, will you. The guy is really hurt, Perry. Got you. So long. What is it, son? One of my buddies is sick and in trouble. You have got to help him then. Yeah. Yeah. He'll take it better from me than from Gunny. I can't help him. Yes you can, son. I can't, ma. I can't. Perry. I watched you fight over twenty fights. Every time you got hurt .. It hurt me too. But that didn't matter because you were a good fighter. And you would fight, win, lose or draw. I am washed up with fighting. There are different kinds of fighting. You were losing a fight ever since .. - Don't talk foolish, ma. What can a man do when he has got no legs? There was a man who lost the use of his legs when he was 39 years old. He didn't quit. He got to be President. Son, it's good to see you in your fighting clothes. Hey, you are getting a little stinky. I've been doing a little thinking. So don't fracture yourself. - You know what? That ranch deal makes a lot of sense. - Of course it makes sense. I was kidding before but now I'm squaring off. I am going to tell my girl. She should know everything I know. No secrets. The only way to be happy is not to have any secrets. Build up my score, will you soldier? - Okay. Hello? Hi. Hello. Sourpuss. How are you? - I am fine. Where are you? I am with friends and we are discussing a big deal that involves you. What did I do to deserve this? Patricia, I am serious. Look. Patricia, how would you like to go and live on a ranch? Well, who are you? There's lots of things I can tell you. But none of them would be as interesting as the fact that I am Cliff's buddy. Patricia, what about this here ranch deal? What kind of a ranch? - Outdoor ranch. Everyone should get a lot of fresh air. Do you like chickens? They are wonderful fried. Okay. We'll have chickens and cows. And horses. And maybe some pigs too. No rabbits? Ah, rabbits aren't trustworthy. And now I will tell you the best part. - Where is Cliff? Cliff is right here standing right next to me. We are in a very exclusive rendezvous on Western Avenue call The Swan Club. In order to get in you have to push the door in. Let me talk to Cliff, will you? Hello, Patricia. Cliff, You're getting drunk. Get out of there. Look. The only reason I called was to find if you wanted to go to this ranch with us. I want Yes or No. Nothing else. Get out of there, Cliff. You can come up here and talk if you like. Are you giving me a 'no' for an answer? Cliff, please. Very well. That's all I wanted to know. I doubt we can count on my girl for this ranch deal. Forget about her, my friend. If the worst comes to the worst we'll raise women too. Hey, you hit 35,000. Yeah, You win a free game. My friend, I award it to you. With clusters. - Thank you. Hey, get a load of that. What is going on there? - I don't know. Play it down. Well, get a load of him. Hubba, hubba, hubba. What gives? Gives a lot. We're going to secure us a ranch. All of us. Cliff and you and me. And we're going to hire nobody but ex-servicemen. That's the scheme. We can't let a guy just stand there and not get him a drink. Right away. Got to get the man a drink. I don't get this. Look. You didn't have to come, Perry. - But you said Tabeshaw was in trouble. That plate in his head has been killing him. I wanted to get him to a hospital so I figured Gunny would be the guy to help. Could you reach him? - No. That's just a well. I figure the size of the ranch depends upon the amount of cash we can get. Let's drink to old killer Kincheloe. Do you want anything, lady? - Give me a rye and water please. And that blond young man standing next to the marine. Now, lady. The blond young man standing next to the marine please. This is a nice ranch you have. - What are you doing here? Oh. Just having a drink with you. Did you order? He is getting it too. Happy days. As they say. Go on. Drink. What did you come down here for? Because. You are drinking and you might do something silly. What would I do that's silly? I thought you had straightened yourself out with the foreman this afternoon. It will happen again. Then I will really bust him in the jaw. That will be that. That takes care of your job. That leaves me. Go home and pack your bags. Where are we going? - To New Mexico to buy the ranch. Cliff, this is the growing city of the world. Pat. Anywhere you go you'll have to face the same headaches. It will be fun. We'll see new places. We'll see new people. I see new people until it drives me crazy. We'll be happy. Actually, you have no beef. Who has? Only the men who are never coming back. Here we go. Right back to Johnny Ruscomb. Did you put his picture back on the table again? I am going. With you or without you? With you or without you, Pat? Without me. Pay the man for my drink. How you doing, men? We're doing great. I see we belong to the same club. Where did you sweat out the four freedoms, brother? They busted him out of the army on a frame-up. Let's see you make that one. A sharpshooter. Fellows, this is Mr Prager and Mr Lawson. Hiya, fellows. I suppose you've told them all about our organisation, have you, Mitch? No. Not yet. Ever heard of our outfit? American War Patriots. - That is us. The local district anyway. We got 1,700 members throughout the country. I've heard of most of the rest of them but I'm afraid that's one I missed. Son, we start where those fussbudgets leave off. Know what we're going to do for you boys? How would you like a bonus $200-a-month income for as long as you live? Without the labor union. You fellows know that 15 percent of every pay check you get .. Goes to those foreign-born labor racketeers. That is the kind of a free country we were fighting for. Of course, we don't know whether you men are eligible. See, we have certain restrictions. What does that mean? No Catholics, Jews or negros. You know, we had a friend named Maxie Klein. If Maxie was here he'd probably spit right in your eye. Yeah? Yeah. But Maxie is dead in Guadalcanal. So just for him I'm going to spit in your eye. Push them to me. Push them to me! This one is mine. Go and help Perry. Bill. Let's take off. - The car is out front. You go ahead, Perry. I will cover you. Can you make it, Perry? - Yeah. Cops. Come on. Out the back way. I'll see if is clear. Alright. Break it up. Alright, you do the talking. You'll have to do the talking on the way to hospital. Get an ambulance on the double. - Right. I don't know what gets into you fellows. Once you get to be a hero you figure you've got to be a hero all your life. If I had a plate in my skull I wouldn't go around looking for saloon fights. They weren't looking for it, sir. It came to them. Okay, Sergeant. Get the patient ready. Cliff. I am not going to run away. Yeah. Me too. If I make this I'll go back to Stinking Creek and get me that cowhand job. It will take you a little longer to get that cattle ranch but .. You will be home. I listen. Hello, Cliff. Hello dad. Glad you got here. How is the other boy going to be, Sergeant? We'll check after the operation. I'll call you at headquarters. We are holding all those men. You fellows get an assist for nailing them. Good. I'm going to get Tabeshaw's papers squared away with Admitting. I'll see you all later. - I'll go along for the ride. So long, Perry. It is good to be back on my feet again. Anything else I can do? - I think not, Lieutenant. Thanks for picking me up and for straightening this out. Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm glad it happened, dad. It showed me that if you believe a thing you'd better get in and fight for it. A lot of things have happened to me since I've come back. I've got a good job. Although I don't think I want to do it all my life. I would like to be with my girl all my life. If she would let me. But right now, standing here with nothing decided. I am better off than Perry. And luckier than Tabeshaw. It will take time I guess. Sure. You didn't make yourself a soldier overnight. You can't make yourself a civilian again overnight. I am going to stay here and sweat out the operation, dad. You had better run along. I'll sweat it out with you, son. This is what I did when I waited for you once before. 23 years ago come May 18th. Ma. How is your buddy? - He is going to make it. Oh, I am glad. Are you alright, son? I am alright, ma. And I am going to stay alright. I know you are, Cliff. Amy, you shouldn't have come here at this hour. Well, I had to keep Pat company. Pat? Cliff. Pat. ..s-d..
