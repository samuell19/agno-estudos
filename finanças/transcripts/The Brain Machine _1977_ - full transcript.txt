(woman) I don't know why you ever have to go to a gym. (man) I don't have to go. You see, there are exactly 128 steps to the underground lab and coming down twice a day would equal jogging about two miles, I guess. Exclude Sundays and holidays that would be exactly-- Don't tell me. I've had more truth than I can manage lately. What do you mean? Additions to the program? Mm, yes. I didn't ask for those additions. Well, who did? Roth, I suppose. Well, what's on the menu for today? The four subjects. Roth's finally made his decision. (dialing telephone) (phone ringing) General's office. Internal security here. Put me through to the General immediately. Yes? Let's go to scramble, sir. (electronic beeping) Go ahead. What's the trouble? Someone has broken into the top secret files. Do you know what's missing? Two things, sir: the brain machine file and Dr. Krisner's project file. Then it's probably Krisner. Nobody else would connect those two files. If it is Krisner, he knows that his project is nothing more than a guinea pig to test the brain machine. How do you want me to handle this? Get Krisner. I'll have Saxon and his men secure the grounds. And send my car, I'm coming back. (woman) We've got all this truth business programmed and punishment for the subjects if they tell a lie but how are we gonna know if they tell the truth? Don't ask me, love. We get the money to do what we want to do. Then we have to do some of the things the higher-ups want done. Why don't you give me a quick rundown on our four lucky winners? Okay, there's four out of 147 applicants, so they ought to be what we need. (slide advances) Minnie Lee Parks, age 22. Birthplace, Tennessee. One year of college. Rated low academically. Single. No previous marriage. No immediate family. Kinda cute. Kinda dumb, just my type. Well, she is. (slide advances) Judd Reeves. Age 31. Born in Pennsylvania. Truck driver, bartender, carpenter. Well, he's versatile. Army service, honorable discharge. No immediate family. Think he's kind of cute too? (slide advances) Emory Neill, age 44. Post-graduate work in seminary. Contributing editor to various religious publications. Serious automobile accident two years ago. No immediate family. (slide advances) Willard West. Age 26. Father, medical doctor. Mother, Ph.D. in literature. I.Q. above 150. Star athlete in high school. Held no permanent position. Traveled since graduation from college five years ago. Inherited large estate when both parents were killed in a plane crash. No immediate family. Okay, if you'll get the lights, we'll start programming our subjects. What's all that about? Dr. Krisner. (alarm wailing) Sam, I think maybe you better cover the trace road. Here he comes. Get moving. Have you got enough men out there to stop Krisner? He can't get away now, sir. What happened? Must have discovered our plans for his project. That's all I can figure. Saxon, get those files. I don't care what it takes. Yes, sir. Mobile 3 out. Mobile 3, Mobile 3, this is Mobile 4. I spotted him-- he's at the end of the trace road. (thunderclap) (gunshot) (dog barking) Send the chief to my office and call Washington. Tell the Senator we've had an emergency. I'll be in touch with him as soon as I can. Take the General's briefcase inside. (man) Yes, sir? The General wants the chief. Report to him on the double in his office. Can we tie in on schedule? We can, but not without problems. What problems? Fail-safe, it's a specially designed system. We can't bypass it. There's no problem if it's not activated. But if it is activated, the computers take complete control of both projects: the E-box and C.I.C. In my opinion, sir, that's a very big risk. (phone ringing) Come on, Roth. Come on. (horns honking) Dr. Roth's office. Sorry, wrong number. (woman) Mr. Saxon to see you, sir. Send him in. Yes, sir. Were all the documents in Krisner's briefcase? The documents are all here, sir. Now, what about Dr. Krisner? I've already got the right team on Krisner. They'll take care of him. (phone rings) Hello? Yes. But you don't understand. I've got to reach the Senator. Is there any way I-- No. No, I'll call him later. My secretary received a phone call. Krisner was trying to reach me. Krisner tried to reach you? When? This morning. Do you know where he is? He knows my work on the Environmental Committee, but I hope to God he doesn't tie me in with this. Frankly, I'm concerned now with whether we should stop the brain machine tests. No, we shouldn't stop anything, Senator. We're changing to our standby project, Dr. Roth. You think Roth suspects anything? No, he thinks his project was set up by the Environmental Committee. Then he doesn't tie you in in any way. Will this change mean you'll need more funds? Roth will, but we've got enough to handle it. Good. You know I'm sticking my neck out a long way, General, because I believe this country is riddled with enemies, inside and outside. Your machine may be the only defense. I certainly hope so, sir. You know it's not vigilance anymore, General. It's surveillance. Eternal surveillance is the price of liberty. That's why I'm willing to go all the way with you. Thank you, Senator. "Dear Senator-- "What I am about to write you is more horrible--" (door knob rattling) (gasping) No, no-- (phone ringing) General's office. (intercom buzzes) Yes? Krisner's dead, sir. (woman) Yes, sir. Fill out a special administrative transfer for Dr. Krisner. He's been transferred. And send a memo of this to all personnel at E.C.C. Mr. Saxon to see you, sir. I'll be there shortly. This matter is closed. You take care of this. We simply can't go with this project, sir. The subjects are all wrong for us. They're totally programmed for environmental research. You said yourself that it was dangerous. Otherwise we would have never selected Krisner's project. We're going with Roth. But that's impossible, sir, it won't work. Make it work. Welcome to the Environmental Control Center. You have a copy of regulations. Three things you must memorize: One: You are a member of a team; Two: You have access only to the E wing. You must not enter the area of other projects. You received a name tag which you will wear at all times-- you will not wear this in the E-box; Three: Truth is the most vital aspect of this program for which you have volunteered. You mean the whole truth? Yes. About everything? Yes. (laughs) Golly. This experiment is gonna get an X rating. (all laugh) Okay, calm down. Our study is one of survival. You have volunteered to be a part of something of vital importance. The scientific study of man and his environment. Are there any questions? Uh, yeah. You said volunteered. I, uh-- I thought we was being paid. You're right, Mr. Reeves. You are a paid volunteer. We've accepted only people with no immediate family because there is less chance for embarrassment over confidential matters, and we must have the truth, all of it, not part. I believe you know my assistant, Dr. Portland. Excuse me, Dr. Roth, but there's an urgent call. Saxon, research control. Saxon-- it's a call I've been waiting for. I requested more funds. Excuse me, I'll be just a moment. Saxon, Roth. How've you been? Fine, Dr. Roth, and you? Waiting for your call. We're almost ready. Yes, well, that's what I'm calling about. Your work has interested some very big people. Well, I'm glad to hear about that. These people would like some cooperation from you. But I thought it was understood that I was to be left alone until I could report my complete findings. Yes, I know, I told them that but they insisted. Tell them my answer is no. I'd think twice before I'd give that answer, Roth. You need funds. I have your requisition right in front of me now. Don't tie my hands. You know damn well why I'm out of funds. These people have power and they're not afraid to use it. The truth is you know where they've got me. (laughs) You said it, I didn't. (slide advances) Ugly. (slide advances) Fun. (slide advances) Music. (slide advances) Woman. (chuckles) Why did I say "woman"? A cemetery shouldn't make me say that. Don't question your responses. Just relax and respond freely. Well, it doesn't make sense. Please, Father Neill. Not Father-- not Father. I'm sorry-- Reverend. Are you all right? Yes. You were recalling something vividly. Was it pleasant or painful? Both. Let's try the screen again. (slide advances) Woman. (chuckles) I, uh-- I thought it. I tried not to say it and-- I'm gonna let Dr. Roth take over at this point. I just want to see what he thinks. Aren't you considerably more comfortable with Dr. Roth? Where's Roth? What? Where is Roth? I can't hear you. Where's Roth? He's in Accounting, but I definitely would not disturb him right now. New funds? I think he's got 'em. Would, uh, you take over the interview with Reverend Neill? Why, what's wrong? Well, he's-- uptight about something. We've really selected some strange subjects. (birds chirping) Give me your weapon. If you wanted to protect yourself, which weapon would you choose? That's a P-38. I'd take it, you know. Take it. Now, take a closer look at this. A very clever bugging device. Testing 1-2-3. (chuckles) I think I changed my mind. I'd rather have this. In certain situations, things like this can be real effective. That's the correct weapon, all right. But at best it's only one percent effective. If you really want to know your enemy, you got to know what he's thinking. Not what he's saying. "If I could hear the music I heard when I was young, I wouldn't be out of step." Are you quoting someone? Yes. Who? Myself. One of my sermons. You feel you're out of step? Yes. In here or everywhere? (chuckles) It's myself. Then it's everywhere. Are you trying to get back? I, uh... I suppose so. I don't know, I... Maybe that's why I applied. I... At times you have a speech impediment. Yes. This impediment, this hesitation. Is it from childhood? I don't know, uh... what it was. I can't explain it. I, uh... I just don't know, maybe... maybe God knows, I don't. I... Doctor, I don't think I better go on with this. I, uh... I don't think I'm a good subject. I, uh... I thought that it was going to be different. I'm not a good subject. On the contrary, you're excellent. Not perfect. Thank you. Doctor, uh... May I ask you a question? Yeah, it's your time. Do you ever pray? Often, in my own way. Why? Well, I guess I don't want to take any unnecessary chances. Our attitude on that matter is fairly close. What is my attitude? You know man exists and you believe God exists, but you're not sure which one created the other. (groans) (gasps softly) No. Roth knows something little Morris doesn't know. Anyway in the land of the blind a one-eyed man's a king. Nuts? No, thanks. (Minnie Lee screaming) What the hell? Minnie Lee. (Minnie Lee screaming) What's wrong, Minnie Lee? What happened? Someone was here. In my room! He was trying to feel-- What the--? What's all the racket? I don't know. (yawning) (door opens) What is it? I thought I heard someone screaming. I heard something. I want a lock on my door. I want a lock. Okay, dear, but you go back to sleep now. (sobbing) Oh, please don't go. Please don't leave me. You just lay there and go back to sleep. (crying) Don't wake up Dr. Roth. She's had a nightmare, that's all. I understand. Is everything all right? Is there anything we can do? Did any of you hear anything before she screamed? No, I was sleeping. Is she all right? Maybe there's something I could do to help? No, Dr. Portland's with her right now. You-- she just had a nightmare, that's all. You gentlemen go back to sleep. It's nothing. Good night. (Roth) Why did you lie, Reeves? I didn't lie. You lied, Reeves. What is the one word we've tried to impress upon you? What one word? Truth. Say it again. Truth. You've never been in jail? Reeves, you have a police record. You've also been in reform school. What about the army? The, um... the army? You were a troublemaker there too. What do you think we are, incompetent? You don't think we check things out? The truth, Reeves. Absolute accuracy. One lie can cause us a lot of trouble. Look, I didn't lie exactly. I was put inside a jail. But when I said I was never in jail, it was because I didn't do nothing. I was innocent. Have you ever been booked for theft? I never stole nothing in my life-- but food. And that's not stealing if you're hungry enough. You're dismissed from the project. You gotta let me do this. Please. What you may have done in your life is no great matter to us. The truth is everything. Everything! Now, do you completely understand this? Yeah. Are you pleased? Well, I'm satisfied, but old Roth isn't. Well, it's another change of D-day. No, not necessarily. It just means we're gonna go through every checkpoint and every phase again. What's bothering him? Everything. (chuckles) That's impossible. This place gives me the all-overs. Doctors running around like a chicken with its head cut off. And last night, I know I wasn't dreaming. And these guards, they make me think of tombstones. It's like we were gonna be buried or something. Not like we were, as if we were. Like is never followed by a complete predication. You better not let me in your room alone 'cause I wouldn't just be touching you. And when I left, you wouldn't be screaming. You'd just smile. This is where the real danger lies. Feeding impulses into the upper and lower cortex of the brain can be dangerous. Carol, you'd be in there also. You're vulnerable. Biofeedback training will help me. The others, well, that's why we're experimenting. Like another redaction of impulse feed on all stages? Yes, if you don't mind. Carol, get my Phase III impulse breakdowns on my desk. (click) (man) Yes, sir? Are we ready to test the first patch-in? We need more time, sir. I'm still worried about the fail-safe circuits. But we can try it if you say so. Then try it. (zapping) What the hell? Go to standby. Standby. Not responding. Check sections E. Sections E circuits not responding. Well, don't just stand there, Dr. Portland! Call engineering! (zapping) Hold it! It's back. (high-pitched whirring) (dialing phone) (phone rings) Dr. Roth's office. This is Williams. Engineering. Hold on. Engineering. Yes. We checked out all of the circuits in E-cell. Everything seems to be okay. I'm going over next to-- Hold on just a second. I think I've run across something. He's found something. (screaming) (electricity zapping) (breathing rapidly) (phone rings) Yeah? Carol! How'd you know where I was? The computer shut down again and we had an accident. I'll be right there. What happened? An accident. Who was it? One of the men from electrical engineering. He was checking the circuits. He found something. That. We blew it. We blew it. Today's the first time I ever yelled at you. I know. How long did it take for you to forgive me? A few minutes or an hour or-- have you forgiven me? I forgave you before it ever happened. (instrument pinging, heart beating) You're wonderful. Your work, you. (pinging and heartbeat continue) Do you hear him? (chuckles) Yes. Feel him. (thunder rumbling) Do you like trees? Woods? I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I'm not in love with them. Not like my father. My father really loved trees. He liked the woods, the shadows, walking. The first thing I clearly remember is a tree. It was enormous. And my father was leaning back against it. His eyes were closed. Geez, I was like four. (both chuckle) What kind of tree? I don't remember. I don't remember anything about it except the trunk, how big it was. Mmm. Yeah. The bark was smooth like a poplar. It was too dark for a poplar. He had, uh, given me a knife. And I remember opening it, but I didn't cut on that tree. I just stood there and thought about how long it would take me to cut it down with that knife. I clearly remember thinking that-- Did you get along well with your parents? Well, my parents left me alone. When I wrote poetry, my mother didn't sneak around and read it. When I played football, my father didn't keep bragging to the world how good I was. (chuckles) Were you good-- at either one? Sure, sometimes I was good at both. (chuckles) Do you know anything about the brain? Nope. Your brain has the strongest impulses of any subject we've tested. Is that good or bad? Neither one. Nature doesn't make moral judgments. It simply balances the books, I think. We're losing it. The computers are overriding us. Emergency, emergency. All sections. How'd your father-- (alarm beeping loudly) (alarm bell clanging) (alarm sounds continue) Damn it, what's happened now? We're dead-- it quit. I've lost total power twice-- why? Roth, I don't know, could be anything. We're checking it out. You do that. What the hell is going on, Roth? I don't know, but I intend to find out. Computers have total control. (zapping and clicking) Control returning. C.I.C.'s impulse is to normal. (sighs) It's up to them now. They have control. Why do they have to keep asking all those personal questions? To ascertain the truth, sweetheart. Well, what's that got to do with pollution and population explosion? You haven't been listening properly. You see the truth is everything. Truth will clear the water, banish the smog, lower the birth rate, break down DDT and benefit the world. (Minnie Lee) Dr. Roth didn't say all that. (Willard) Well, I can say all that. Why did you volunteer? I wanted to do something for my country. Your what? (laughs) (sighs) I wanted to do something for my country. Well, of course you did. That's because you have vision. And where there is no vision, the people perish. (man) Now, each day in E-box will represent five years of time. Now, you've all been briefed on a number of problems, discomforts and possible dangers involved. Now, the population explosion is going to be simulated, not by increasing the number of people in the box, but by decreasing the space. The walls will actually move inward toward the service module. Now, certain pollutants will be added to the area and noise levels will fluctuate. Any questions? Now, we'll be doing many things. We'll be measuring the tiniest electrical impulses of your brain and we'll be sending impulses back into the box. You know the magic of this computer enables us to formulate and insert into this experiment calculations that would have taken many great minds many years to perform. This may look like a very simple device, however that's not the case. Now, Dr. Portland has taken this very simple device and developed for this project an impulse sensor which conducts to the computer every vital function of your body, like blood pressure, heartbeat and so on. As you know, Dr. Portland will be instructing you on rest, sleep and exercise periods, all of which are very necessary. Are there any questions? Um... yeah. When it's hooked up in there, is it ever gonna shock us? You shouldn't feel a thing. Dr. Morris-- I've changed my mind. I, uh-- I don't want to go. Why? It's, uh... it's just that I, uh... I'd feel lost without my collar. Dr. Roth? I think we can make an exception in this case. Thank you. (phone ringing) They're ready to go into the E-box, General. Good. What are my orders now, sir? Stand by. As all of you know in your briefings, this safety device is simple. In the face of any emergency, anyone can just break the glass. That's all there is to it. Simple. But I'd like to underscore in your minds the consequences can be far-reaching. That of a major matter, this experiment will be immediately aborted. With a minor matter, that you will receive no further money. How do you feel, Reverend? Much better now. Thank you. (door sliding shut) (mechanical whirring) (man) Yes, sir? Begin Stage I brain probe procedure. Stage I only. Repeat, Stage I only. Right, sir. (instruments beeping) This is C.I.C. Control. We have visual. Visual, roger. Integrating audio MX4-5-2. Audio MX4-5-2, roger. Effect T minus 20 and counting, mark 10. Roger. T minus 20 marking 10. Mark 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1-- integrate. Why don't you take a break? I could use one. Let's take a look at our children first. Okay. Let's take a look at service module camera 2. Camera 2, hold on-- nothing. (rhythmic beeping) Camera 2, operational and functioning. Stage one of operation is complete. The others. Roger-- negative. That can't be-- let's see. Damn it. Try Carol's station. There, hold it now. We got Carol again. Well, at least we're not completely blind. Look, shake it down and see if you can find out why the service module cameras won't work. I'm gonna get some rest. Camera 3. Cameras 4 and 5. This is C.I.C. Control. We have control of the service module cameras. Integrate cameras on 20 and counting. Mark 10. Roger-- Cameras 2 through 5 in sequence. Marking 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Subject 1 in mode phase III. Integrate C.I.C. circuit to probe status. Roger. Tape is rolling. Probe status C.I.C. circuit integrated. (electrical buzzing) Easy, easy. Reduce modulation by 5. We have a sensitive subject here. Modulation minus 5-- Mark. (buzzing stops) (gunshot, woman screams) (Minnie Lee) Daddy, we did it. (chuckles) What are you doing up? Standing watch. I hope I didn't wake you up. No, you didn't. Anything wrong? No, I'm all right. I'm just not sleepy I guess. I was thinking. About me? About my granddaddy. Somebody wrote a song about my granddaddy once. It was a ballad and it told the story about this man who was poor. And he made a lotta money selling burial insurance. And he bought this mortuary and a pair of alligator shoes. And he'd go downtown and he'd meet these people who put him down, like the banker and he'd say: Business bankers are mighty and high-- We have a good probe. Audiovisual clear. Monitoring Subjects 1 and 4. Roger, tape is still rolling. Stop tape roll. One minute to Zebra. Stand by. Roger, tape roll stopped. One minute to Zebra, standing by. Stand by service module camera 3.

(buzzing, Reeves gasps) (explosions and gunfire) (printer clacking) What the hell? (bell dinging) Yes? Dr. Portland-- This computer, I don't quite understand it. It's... Roth's sleeping and if it isn't too important, I'd rather not wake him. Well, go on, what is it? Well, the computer's kicked out a question here on Subject #1, C.I.C. NSC25. It's a question of previous marriage, true or false. What do you make of it? Minnie Lee, our programmee, she's #1. Possibly impulse receiving. Let's ask her. Whatever you say. Should I get Roth? No, you can follow it through. It seems routine to me. Here she is now. Did I do something? (laughs) No, Minnie Lee, just routine. Dr. Morris would like to ask you a question from the computer. Do you mind? I guess not. Minnie Lee, this is Dr. Morris. Were you ever married? (laughs nervously) No, Dr. Morris. I told you that before. I was never married. I don't know what it is. I don't know what I said to cause any trouble. I've never been married. It was annulled. I told you the truth! I've never been married. When something is annulled, it's like it ain't never happened before. My daddy said it weren't a marriage. That's what my daddy said. And he was hurt worse than anybody. And I don't like you saying I told lies and messed up everything! When I told my daddy about the baby, it was too late. (sobbing) After it was annulled. He didn't know about the baby. He wouldn't have had it annulled. You... you can't annul a baby, except by killing him. And that's what I did. And when my-- my daddy found out, it just killed him. (sobbing) Don't you see? I killed my baby. And my daddy too! (printer clacking) (crumpling paper) Portland? Yes? We've got another one. Judd Reeves. Who the hell do you think you are, man? Morris, what is this? Your version of "Truth or Consequences"? I assure you, Mr. West, that this is in line with the program. Dr. Morris is just following questions from the computer. What do you mean calling me a liar? Judd-- Listen, if you're trying to brainwash me, man, you're crazy. They tried that in the army and they couldn't beat nothing out of me. Judd-- Merriman was, was killed. He was killed, you scientific birdbrain! You shove that up your computer, Morris. Or just come down here and I'll shove it down your throat for you. No, I didn't kill him. He killed himself! Judd, calm down. Now, listen, you just stay away from me, you scientific bitch! Judd, that's enough. Oh, boy. Judd-- This is what I've been waiting for. Calm down. Come on, Willy Boy. Come on. I'm gonna smash that pretty face of yours. Judd? (piercing tone, all screaming) C.I.C. Control, emergency, emergency! All-circuits overload. (tone continues) (all screaming) They'll go mad. Morris, stabilize the impulses! I'll go insane! Shut down C.I.C. circuits one through five. Roger, one through five C.I.C. circuits closed. Roth! Roth! What? It's out of control! Bio... feedback... Bio... feed... (zapping, tone changes to low buzzing) At least she's still alive. We didn't bargain for this. Man, at least I didn't. Let's get him to his bed. Forgive me. (sighs) Oh God, forgive me. How is the oxygen? (Portland) Maximum-- no trouble there. Impulse-ending status? We have to hold the impulse. We can't take another overload like that. Reduction imprints are normal... and the computer's normal. Everything's functioning. Even the service module cameras are working. I don't understand it. There had to be an overload somewhere. Morris, shake the computer down and see-- Saxon. I wonder. I'll be right back. --I just had five human beings go through unnecessary hell because of some kind of malfunction. We've checked everything on our end with no results. Now, something is happening and it's not us. Now, I want to know and I want to know now. Do you understand? There is nothing I can do. (whoosh, clacking) It started again. This is C.I.C. Control, Subject 3 in mode phase III. Integrate C.I.C. circuit to standby. Integrate T minus 20 and counting-- mark. C.I.C. circuits-- probe status standing by. Marking 20 and counting. Let's go for a total brain probe on this subject. Yes, sir. I'll be right down. Roll tape. Integrate C.I.C. circuit probe mode III. Mark T minus 10 and counting. Roger, mark T minus 10, tape rolling. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, integrate. (zapping) (grunting) (woman) You're not ashamed, are you? (Neill) Why should I be? You know, Reverend, this God thing. My husband says that-- I was talking about a personal God. Aren't you afraid God will strike you dead? You sound like you don't believe in a personal God, do you? No. What? A minister and you don't believe in God? I am talking about a personal God. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you. One, two, three, four. St. Peter only denied him three times. I am speaking about a personal God. He does not exist, so let's just let it go at that, okay? No...! Well, here we go again. Okay. Now maybe we'll find out just what's going on. (Neill) What have you done? No one could know this about me. I didn't mean to, I... Oh, not Brother Neill. (crying) You can't do this to me. Only God shall know my sins. You're not God. You can't do it to me. A man who dares enter the infinite must be willing to suffer the consequence. God's wrath shall fall on your head. You and-- your kind. I do not have-- to-- suffer this blasphemy. I-- a man has a right to hide his innermost thoughts from mere mortal men, uh-- Well, God is my witness. My sins-- (tearfully) are between God and me. I don't have to put up with this. I want out. You hear? God in heaven. I want out. (Portland) No, don't! (latches clicking) You fool! (alarm bell ringing) Saxon, you're killing these people. You're going to kill them unless you open those doors! Don't you understand, I've lost all control. This damn machine has gone berserk. The information you want is classified and you're not cleared for national security controlled secrets. You listen to me and you listen well. I'm not going to have the death of five people on my hands. (alarm blaring) Emergency, emergency. It should be opening. Negative! Subject has activated fail-safe. Computers have total control. The fail-safe. It's got to work. Dr. Portland and I designed it. Negative read-out-- fail-safe not responding. (walls creaking) More! You can't stop it. Yes, we can! We've got to stop it! Terrific, they're not even gonna pay us. Judd! Okay, Portland. You get those fingers of yours punching on those buttons and get me out of here! It's all right, Judd, it's all right! They'll get us out. Not with my crummy luck, they won't. I'm gonna die and I know it! Take it easy. The hell you say! I know I'm gonna die and so are you. Judd! We're not gonna die, not if we don't want to. It's that simple. So is dying! Cerebrum Impulse Converter. It actually converts brain impulses into exact pictures of thought. Audio and visual. Jesus. Mortality. You stupid fools. No man, no human ever believes they're going to die. That's a question of faith. That's, that's the paradox in mankind. No one really believes they'll ever die. Don't you understand? Faith, human faith to a computer doesn't compute. Yes, we understand that-- now. We made a mistake. No! No! No...! Oh, no. Let's get her down. We've got to get her down. (tearfully) Roland-- It's Minnie Lee. She just hanged herself. (creaking continues) Roth! Look! Look at what you've done! You've-- you've answered one more question for science. Has it been worth it? Did you learn something? Look at your truth. Garrison here. (General) Seal off the E wing. Isolate Roth and Saxon in the computer lab. I'm coming over. What? I'm sorry, sir, but you've been confined to the computer room until further notice. Those people are dying down there. But we have our orders. Orders? Get out of my-- (thud, Roth grunts) I'm very sorry, sir. But would you go back into the room-- now? The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want-- Jesus, cut that babbling. He maketh me lie down in green pastures-- Stop it! Stop it, Merriman! He leadeth me beside the still water-- (whispers) Roland-- Roland... Don't answer me. Shut up, Merriman! Judd-- he's losing it. He thinks Reverend Neill is Lieutenant Merriman. Through the valley, the shadow of death-- You've been on my back since boot, boy. I will fear no evil-- Do you hear me? I'll kill you! Roth, we've got to get those people out of there. We've got to stop this. We've got to stop it! Thou anointest my head with oil-- That's what you've been telling us, huh, lieutenant? We're all killing machines! My cup runneth over-- But you forgot something. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me-- We're also dying machines! But by God-- --dwell in the house of the Lord-- You're gonna die first, you bastard! You're gonna die first! Die, you bastard, die! Judd, for God's sake! Get away from me! Get away! Judd! Merriman! Reverend? No! (creaking continues) Roth-- I'm gonna kill you, Saxon! I'm gonna kill you! You listen to me, Roth. And you listen good! (screaming) Dr. Portland! If he could break in that service module, we could get 'em out of there. That's it! Willie! Willie! The service module-- You've got to get inside. You've got to break into the service module. Scientific bastard. (crashing, alarm wailing) Come on, let's get to the hatch. We can break 'em out that way. Let's go. I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders not to let anyone out of this room. I'm overriding those orders. But you don't have that authority. What do you mean? I'm the head of this project. I order you to let us pass. But my orders don't come from you or this project. Now, don't move. Hold it, hold it! Don't anybody move. (alarm wailing) Let's go! (zap) (alarm stops) You have to kill me before I'll die. She's down here. Carol! Carol! (zapping and creaking) (Portland) No! The walls! The walls, they've come in! (zapping continues) (explosion) Oh, my God. (door opens) What are we going to do about this, sir? This won't be easy to cover up. (man) Winds reached a velocity of 80 miles per hour. The damage was estimated to be more than one million dollars. And this just in: The National Environmental Control Center reports that Dr. Roland Roth, world-famous authority on the human brain was electrocuted along with six others when a patient broke from an experimental therapy area, ripped through a protective panel and exposed himself and the other victims to 500,000 volts of electricity. Along with Dr. Roth, the dead include his two assistants, Dr. Carol Portland, Dr. Elton Morris, three other patients and Willard West, a patient who apparently went berserk during a routine experiment, shouting "I can't die. "I am immortal. I am God." This is Cornell Wood. That's tonight's late news. Good night. ("The Star-Spangled Banner" plays) That was a good news release, General. Very effective. How did you handle Saxon? He was transferred. Well, the machine works. That's the important thing. And this is only the beginning. But I suggest you get it out of there within the next 24 hours. It'll be out. You understand, no matter what happens, I don't know about anything except the environmental test.
