Hello, everyone. Here's the latest weather report: The observatory has just issued the black rainstorm warning signal. Localised heavy rain is expected to fall exceeding 200mm in an hour tonight. Starting from 10pm to 6am, all public facilities will be closed temporarily. All ferry terminals and public transports will be suspended. Please stay indoors. It shall be the highest rainfall record on Christmas Eve in the past 20 years. That being the case, let's hear a Christmas song! Hey, sir. Judging from your size, it's obvious you were not healthy at all. The second I see, I know that only people without routine exercise will end up lying here. The good news is your wife didn't kill you. Well, not intentionally, anyway. I'm sure she gave you too much good food. So... Your wife still loves you. Too bad, it matters to you no more. Lynn, why are you still here? Uncle king, so are you. And you're married. Aren't you also working over time? I am celebrating... - Hello. - Uncle king, 8pm. Ok. See you before 8pm. Uncle king, save me one donut, will you? Dream on! Merry Christmas, uncle king! Gotta go! Your favorite? He's the one who picked the music. We are celebrating that his wife's murder charge has been exonerated. Forensic pathologist Nick chan. File number 7377851. John hon, 57 years old, male. Cause of death: Atherosclerotic hypertensive cardiovascular disease with cardiac hypertrophy. There's significant thickening on the left ventricle wall. The cause of death is hypertrophy of the heart. Manner of death is determined to be natural. Good job! When I am back in Beijing I'll miss this dialog of yours. Interesting. Your coffee. When are you leaving? Next week. Keep up with the good work! I have very high hope for you. Don't you disappoint me! Don't worry. I've learned from the best. "Murder suspect still at large" Darling. No. Darling. Darling. Merry Christmas. They aren't going anywhere. Since you're still here, let's have a farewell dinner together. You are... Too kind! A Christmas banquet. And here is our dessert! Thank you! Dig in! How's it? Same as yours. Any plans after work? It's pouring. Better go home now. Here comes uncle king. - Time to go home. - Merry Christmas. Hey, uncle king! Don't play too hard tonight! Bye. Bye. The rain is just waiting for us to get off work. Better go home early. Such heavy rain, lucky I have an umbrella. It shouldn't snow or rain on Christmas Eve! Exactly. See you. Bye. 3 more minutes. We go in, we come out. No fuss, no fight and no mess. You with me? Fine. Yes, sir! My wife wants me home within an hour. The sooner the better. Mandy Lee, aged 23. Hello Mandy. I'm sorry we have to meet like this. But you rest assured. I'll figure out what happened to you. Let's start. Can I help you? Yes. Hands up in the air! Now! This fatso gonna slow us down. Can I shoot him? No no no... Stay cool. Cut the land-lines. Where's your cellphone? Left pocket. All clear. What... Do you want? Do as I say if you don't want to die today. December 24, 2017. December 24, 2017. At 20:05 hours. Forensic pathologist Nick chan and intern Lynn qiao performing a post-mortem examination of Mandy Lee... Open it. Ok. Hands up! You know this isn't a bank, right? Put the knife down, doctor. Or she dies. Where are your cellphones? In the back. Can't you cover her face? Listen up. Just follow my word. I guarantee everyone will stay alive. You had a shooting victim brought in last night, named ankie Cheng. Have you done her autopsy yet? No, we haven't. What about x-rays? No. Excellent. I want the bullet in her body. We can't. It's evidence. You talk too much. Did he ask you? Done. Here you go. Uncle king, haven't you frisked him? How could I've known this jerk has 2 cell phones? Don't play tricks. Are we clear? Now, where is she? Her body is in the cooler. Rudolph, you go with doc to get the bullet. Elf, you take good care of this young lady. Her safety depends on you, doc. Understand? My pleasure. I need tools. Ok. But remember, tools aren't weapons. Hey, doc, my hand will shake when I wait too long! Elf, stop messing around! Where did you shoot this woman? How would I know? I didn't shoot her. I mean where on her body was she shot? It requires different tools. Chest. Should be the chest. Keep an eye on the door. We don't wanna be locked in. Gosh, it's cold in here... 2.8 degrees celsius. Corpses don't rot, but human body can easily freeze to death. Wanna give me a hand? I'm opening her up. Shut up. First I will make the standard "y" incision. You don't need to tell me what you're doing! Let me help him, he's injured. Do you understand what I'm saying? I am now pulling the chest skin over her face. Shut up! Enough of this bullshit! Cameras are wiped clean. Who are you people? Do you not know what sound a cat makes when it's being slaughtered? Not now. I am now exposing the chest cavity. Found it. The metal walls block the signal. The signal is very weak. Don't move! I got it. Ok. Bring them back. I got a better idea. Uncle king! He needs medical attention now. If we wait longer, he may die. Keys. Bye bye. Shouldn't we silence them? More bodies, more questions. They can't connect us to the case without the bullet. But I think we should kill them... Enough! Santa. My brother didn't mean to offend you... Killing that girl is the reason we're here. We have what we want. No more talking. Let's go. The asthma medicine is on the desk. Uncle king, take a deep breath. It's gonna be ok. Hang in there! Ankie Cheng And this... What do we do with it? We drive there, toss it into the sea and live happily ever after. And mom gets her treatments. I'm proud of you, baby brother. You did good. I just follow the boss. So this girl, was she as hot dead? I wouldn't know, her face was covered. - What did you just say? - Flip it off and take a look! What did you just say? Her face is covered. My brother asked me if she's hot or not. I said, how would I know? She's covered with that flap of skin. Disgusting! The whole time? The bullet. This is a hollow point. What are you doing? Finding out the truth. What now? Does anyone of us use hollow points? Dammit. What's that for? Trying to get out. The room has an emergency latch in case we are being locked in. Now it finally comes in handy. Uncle king, hang in there. I'll get your asthma meds. Uncle king, call the police right away. Oh no... They must have cut the cables. Ankie Cheng is the daughter of the triad boss, dick Cheng. She was found dead in a rundown house in sham shui po presumably because a drug deal has gone bad. 4 other men were found dead. Money and drugs are missing. Ballistics analysis suggests they shot each other. Damn... They're back! Hurry. Uncle king, ok to move? Keep moving! Coming. Get this thing off me! We need them alive! Get in. This way, uncle king. What should we do now? This way. Hello? Put this off! Don't trigger the alarm! Play with fire! It's locked, this way! Wyatt! This way. Wyatt! Wyatt! Go! You pull the bottom one. They're coming, hurry! Go! Go! What's the matter? The keys must be at the reception! Help me push it! Hang in there! Come. I can open it! Easy. Do it again! How's it going? Doesn't work. No. Let's climb over. Hurry up! Lynn, you go first. You two go ahead. I won't make it. Never say never. You can do it! Coming. - Come up. - Let go. - I can't. - Give me your good hand, king. Dammit. Find something to open it. Uncle king, stop eating so many buns from now on. Nearly there! I can't. I can't. Uncle king. I did it! You made it! Uncle king. I made it. - Climb over. - Hurry! Lynn. Lynn. Hurry! Run! If you leave, I'll kill him. Doc, you must be proud of yourself. Lynn, are you ok? Sure, I'm a cadet graduate after all. You? I'm afraid they won't catch us. What about you, uncle king? I never expected that I could climb up there. Nice and bingo! Nick. Let go of me. Nick. Dammit. Piss off! - Watch over her. - Let go of me. No. Nick. Nick. Are you ok? You're right. He did slow us down. Now move. Doc, I didn't make it quite clear the first time. So let me explain it again. Listen carefully. It hurts? Now bring ankie Cheng's body out here. I'll watch you take the bullet out. Did you call the police? Impossible. They don't have any phones. Answer it. Nice and calm. Hello? Hey, Lynn, it's kit from the funeral home. I am here to pick up a body. Get rid of him. Not a good idea. He said get rid of him. I'm telling you, that's gonna cause more problems. And why is that? Because he's from the Hong Kong funeral home. If he doesn't get his body, he will call his boss. According to protocol, his boss will have to notify the health department. Before you know it, shit will hit the fan. Just let him in. Have him come through the front door. Hey kit, could you come through the front door, please? What happened to the back gate? The buzzer is broken. So please come to the front door. Thanks. Fine. I'll park up front. Damn, it's raining out here! Good job. Rudolph, go check the front door. Make sure everything appears to be normal. Elf, clean up the autopsy room. Open the door for him first. You have 40 seconds. And you get the body out before she runs out of air. The clock is ticking, doc! Hurry up! I'm at the front door. Kit, wait. I will be there in one minute. Hurry! I'm getting wet here! At Christmas, global warming is real! Dammit! Rudolph, take her to the back. She can't be seen like this. Don't touch her. Doc. W ait. Let me double-check. Just making sure you weren't sending out "our" body. Damn, a baldy! What now? Don't be clever. If you were so cautious, you wouldn't have left the bullet! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Where's uncle king? He left already. No way... Don't think I've ever seen the fatso leave the desk. And how's your lovely intern, Lynn? She's on a break. Kit! Kit! What's wrong? Look, Santa has been murdered! Merry Christmas! You married? Don't tell me you're a henpecked husband. Is that a Rudolph mask? Take the mask off if you have guts! Let me see your face. Will you die if you stop talking? Wuss! Cool. You can be a crane operator. Maybe I spoke too soon? Are you ok? I'm fine, just a little cut. A shot of whisky! I know you like it. Scared of women? Oh you really are scared of women! You're such a pain in the ass. Don't you know that? You're wearing this cute mask. Holding a gun makes you feel masculine, huh? To hell with that. Just shut up! What's that on your face? None of your business! Someone scratched you hard? None of your business! Your wife did it? Bitch! You hit me? I never knew a man could love his wife as much as he did. But when she died, I knew you weren't far behind. Without a woman's love to keep him alive, a man is just like a zombie. Know what I mean? I think I do. Sorry. I talk too much. The cops caught the suspect, right? But not enough evidence. Bastards. Call it the justice system. You know how I talk to women now. I know she can beat you up. Bitch! Dammit! Did you hear that? You really can fight! Run! Kit! Help! Someone's trying to kill me! No! Did you hear a gunshot and someone screaming? No. It's probably Lynn watching TV. She's been into those Samuel Jackson films lately. Why don't you two go to the bar with me? After I have delivered the body, I'm done. Thanks, kit. I'll take a rain check. Let's go pick up some girls. 100% success rate. I still have work to do. - Go. - Do me a favor! Picking up girls! Don't just cut corpses all the time. You enjoy yourself! You love cutting corpse so much. Your loss. Bye! Kit! You change your mind? Come on baby! Come on! You had a few drinks. Drive safely. My passenger is dead already. So I should be fine. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye! Run! Good choice, doc. Now let's finish what we started. You tried to hit me? You will regret. What's the matter? How much do you want it, kiddo? If only you listened to us from the beginning, the security guard wouldn't need to die. Go check on your brother. Hands in the air. Where's my brother? Put the gun down! Where's my brother? I told you to put the gun down! - Where's my brother? - Stop right there. How much longer? If you want it faster, I can use the X-ray. It takes so much longer! No way! Don't move! Hands in the air. What happened to them? I killed them. Put your gun on the floor and slide it over. Very good. Now take off your mask. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Don't move. If you see my face, I'll have to carve out your eyeballs, so you can never identify us. Maybe not today, but some day for sure. Emergency call center. How may I help you? Hello... Hello? Sir? I'm sorry. Wrong number. Hello... What's the point of shooting me here? You should have shot me right here, bitch! We should waste her now! - Go to hell! - If you want the bullet fast, I need her to assist me. Otherwise it could take much longer. More time, more risk. 10 minutes. Sorry, I messed up. Forget it. Focus on the body. I noticed one of her fingernails was broken. And there is dried blood under it. Have you also noticed that Rudolph has scratch marks on his face? They killed her so she couldn't ID them. They are wearing bulletproof vests and use police hand signals. They're cops. I think so too. I can't help you after all. Say that again. You see the hole in her back? The bullet went through. Your bullet's in the crime scene. Santa, if what he said is true, then we are lost. We are so lost. Stop saying the word "lost"! How many times have I told you? If you don't believe me, you're welcome to look for it yourself. It's the body's inner gases you're smelling. Hydrogen and methane. You will never forget that smell. Do you know who shot your wife? The killer is still on the loose. She was shot during the jewelry shop heist, right? What was she doing there? Buying jewels? She went there to Polish her ring. I also heard you had insisted on performing her autopsy yourself. How did it feel, cutting up your own wife? Got it. We're done! That's a piece of her rib. I'm truly convinced it's shattered when you shot her. Do you know who's in the wrong? You! Actually your wife's killer was caught. But he was set free for lack of evidence. Life sucks, right? Do you know what he said? He said he enjoyed watching your wife die very much! Just like how much I enjoy watching this right now. You gambler, you want all in? You gamblers don't like to see baldies. You think they are bad luck, right? Of course! You all hate hearing the word "lost"! On the back of your cellphone, there's the lucky number 8. Number 8 means winning. I feel sorry for you actually. You must have lost a lot of money in Macau. You shut your mouth or I shoot you in the head! Let's have another bet! I'll help you find the bullet, and you'll let her go. One more thing. You look uglier than a corpse with your mask off. If you don't mind, please put it back on! Let's have another bet! If you cheat, I'll shoot her in the head right in front of you! Station, PC officer 26635 calling. I'm at the kwai chung public mortuary. It looks quiet outside. I'm about to check inside, over. Police. We received a 999 call earlier. Just checking to make sure everything's ok. Open the door. Everything is fine here, officer! Ok, but I need to see that for myself. It's protocol. Open the door now. Give us a minute, please. How are you? Merry Christmas. We just need to look around. This won't take long. Ok. This way. This way. What happened there? The intern is clumsy. He can't even push a wheel bed properly. Cleaning crew is off tonight. I know exactly what you mean. Is that blood? We're in a morgue. Of course it's blood. Is this your first visit? May peace be with you. Busy night. Sorry, sorry... Lynn, are you ok? I'm fine. Working so late on Christmas Eve? People don't stop dying just because it's Christmas. Same for us. Too bad we're cops. We have to patrol the streets on public holidays in case some teenagers puke on the sidewalk. Am I right? You have our respect. Still working, officer? Done? Done. Officer, anywhere else you need to check? Hands in the air, where I can see them! Come out, all of you. Hurry up! You think I'm stupid? I saw the shell casings on the floor. Officer, he has a gun. No, officer. We work here. No, officer. She's an accomplice. Don't listen to her. - He's lying! - I'm Dr. wong. - They are a gang! - I've been on night shift here for 5 years. - He's holding us hostages! - Don't trust them. Don't believe her, she's lying! It's him! Don't believe her, she's trying to kill us. Officer, please listen to me! Dammit. Wyatt, run! Stand up. Sorry, I can't help you after all. You see the hole in her back? The bullet went through. This is the bullet they're looking for. Keep it safe. You took it out when they locked us in the cooler? It's our only leverage. Stop shooting at me! I must stay and distract them. You go now! No, we need to stick together. That won't work. You've gotta tell everyone they are the killers! Go! Go! Go! Look at that! Two kills in one day! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Release him right away! Give me that! Howard! Kiddo! Howard! Dammit! - You killed my brother. - They have the bullet. It didn't go through her body. Who cares about the bullet?! My brother is dead! I saw it. After we finish the job, we'll come back for him. Where's the bullet, you son of a bitch?! I'll tell you when you lie there some day! I know who has it. Hogtie him right here on the floor. We gonna use him. Kiddo, did you hear that? I just got a nice assortment of tools here. I've got a hammer, some pliers, a scalpel... And this. I'm not even sure what this is... If you don't open the door now, things are about to get quite unpleasant for the doc. If you'll come out now, I won't use any of it. I promise. You just gonna kill us anyway. I told you I would let you guys go. If you don't open the door, I'll torture your hero to death. You don't want him to die because of you, right? All right, I'll start with... the pliers. I'm about to cut one of the doc's fingers. Last chance. Lynn! No matter what you hear, don't come out! I still have 9 fingers. Kiddo, can't you hear he's suffering? Lynn, no matter what you hear, don't come out! I'm gonna cut another finger. Come out! Don't scare her anymore. Shoot me! But be careful this time! Remember to take the bullet with you! You have guts! You think I really won't kill you? W ait. Kiddo, open the door! I'm gonna kill him! She's blocking the door with a body! She can't get away. Let me. Help me here. - Dammit! - Go to hell! Kiddo, you can't get away! Goddamnit! She escaped! You wait here! Dammit! She's still in there! Dammit! She didn't come out here! What? She's still in that room! Find her! Come out, bitch! Come out! I know you're in here! Come out! Come out! Bitch, you are dead! Dammit! Lynn. Take the stairs. Lynn, you have to hide. Not this time. I'm staying with you. Do you know where they keep the walkie-talkies? In the break room. Are you tired? The game has only just begun. This way. You guys are doomed. Inspector kit tong. Inspector Wyatt so. I know who you are. I know what you did. When you received the intel about a drug deal, you rushed to the scene. Your goods are here. Ok. All good. Not bad. This chick is hot! Let's get things done and stop messing around. How's it? All good? It's not like I don't pay you. Why give me this shit? Hey, what are you trying to say? My stuff is great! Did you try it properly? Trying to dine and dash? All those drugs and money were right there. Yours for the taking. So you took everything. No witnesses. No evidence to tie you to the crime scene. Kit. Kit... Kit... Lucky it's you! Bobby, it's gonna be fine... Take them all! Only... how could you have known the triad boss's daughter was right in the next room? I've seen you before... All units. Shots fired in sham shui po. Station, p128066 calling. We're at the scene in sham shui po. Requesting back up. Inspector tong, you must have felt like an idiot when you realized you had used your service weapon to shoot ankie Cheng, because the ballistic report on the bullet would tie your gun to the murder. And the scarier thing is... The triad boss would go after you. You go first. But you know how to cover your tracks. The one piece of evidence that ties you to her murder is the bullet. After I kill you both, no one will ever know. I'm sorry. But they already do. Check the autopsy room. Over there. You see the pedal under the table? Did you see it? It's a medical dictaphone. It connects directly to the recording system. It's been recording us this whole time. I'm sure another colleague of mine, who is in the health department this very moment, is staring at her computer, obviously confused. We cut the phone lines before we even walked in here. Have you ever heard of satellite antenna? I guess you didn't notice the satellite dish on the roof. You're stalling. You would have told this to me earlier. Listen up. I will tell the truth to the whole world. What causes chenimal reaction with hydrogen peroxide? Magnesium. Find it and spread it on the floor. Ok. But such chemical reactions won't hurt him. Flammable powder. I'll lead him here. Good idea. Flammable powder in a confined space. A touch of flame can cause explosions. You stay here. I'll draw his attention. Wyatt so. Do you know when your inspector tong put on a silencer? And why? What are you doing? Are you crazy? My brother and I were never gonna make it. You knew it from the get go, didn't you? We were never supposed to get out alive. You planned to take our share and pay your gambling debts! We were crazy to ever listen to you. Come out! Keep going, Come out! Or you'll die ugly. You think I wanted this? Don't you force me! He's coming! Hide. Done. Kiddo. The game is over! Goodbye! You asked for it! I'm sending you to see your wife. Go to hell! Don't move! Stand still! Shoot me. Stay right there. Shoot me! Go to hell! Dammit. You two forced me! Doc, everybody for himself, and god against all! I released your wife's murderer! How about that? Dammit, you have it all along! You can have it! What now? Step back. Hurry! It's gonna explode any minute. Trust me. Now! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Did it ever occur to you that's how you would have spent your last Christmas in Hong Kong? Who says this is my last Christmas here? Hello, everyone. The moment of truth has finally arrived. The black rainstorm warning signal has been cancelled. Christmas is waiting. Let's go out and have some fun!
