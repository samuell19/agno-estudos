Daddy. Everything alright, sweetie? -Yes. What are you doing here? Shall I drop you off? I told you I needed time. -It's already been three weeks. You should have considered it before being with Lea. I was drunk and it was just a kiss. She blew you. A kiss on my genitals. -Have a good day, Nicolas. Hey. -Hey. Surprise. - Very sweet, but I do not have vases left. Is she still angry? -I am desperate. How was your evening? Men are crazy. I met a great guy yesterday. We went out to eat, it was great. But at his home, everywhere photos of his ex. And? - I slept with him. Why? -He paid for dinner. But I did not do everything. Did not you have an appointment? -Which one? The conference with the new director. Fuck. When I see that Demanche Lingerie grows by 30 percent ... I say: Congratulations, Mr. Chassagne. But how to explain the more than 15 percent decline ... of Demanche Cosmetics? Hello Madam the Director. Demanche Cosmetics ... -Yes, I just said that. If you take the gross result ... The dividends, and you compare them with ... With? -Three? Get out. -Excuse me? Get out. Hello. Nicolas Lejeune, Demanche Music. I had to drop my daughter to school. You know what it's like. That is an old photo. That was a joke. Start by explaining why Demanche Music has been dead for two years. Because we tried launching very ambitious artistic projects ... like the band ... The only thing our shareholders want, is making profits. Madam the Director, music is not only about profits. That's why your father bought my label. I do not sell panties and underpants. -Excuse me. Lingerie is also creative. We were the first to launch the double string. I can also launch commercial nonsense. I will launch in 6 months the musical double string ... and sell out the Olympia. That is a nice challenge, Mr. Music. You all heard it. If Mr Music doesn't sell out the Olympia with a new artist in six months ... he will quit. This is the Demanche spirit. ghetto, violence and deals off to graveyard if you're fragile Can I watch? -Yes. I always call my homies when my club is getting hard big caliber watch out, watch out enjoy white sauce, but not in my sandwhich Representing rainbow ghetto I pull out underpants, not strings 9-1, 9-2, 9-3, 9-4 all my homies are on all fours 9-5, 7-5, 7-7, 7-8 all my homies love to suck dick 9-1, 9-2, 9-3, 9-4 all my homies are on all fours That is gay rap. -I noticed, yeah. I thought more feelings in the ghettos would show... that it's not just about violence, but also love and kisses ... In another genre we also have: First class, I love ice cream - You'll like this. I love ice cream with two balls ... even more when cream is melting I love ice cream ... - It ain't bad, right? So many balls, so many balls That's so lame, it can be a hit. -The problem is that she is only 14. Are you kidding? -Well, she'll be 15 this September. Call the cops right away. -It is not that bad. Yes, it is. Our new boss is a lunatic. Listen to him then. Ending torned up at the Balard station His name is Theophile. Such a depressed guy does well with yuppies. every second in my heart smashed the train platform Try to contact him rapidly. Tomorrow, because I'm late for a date. -Again? The more I meet, the more likely I meet the one. You still have to listen to all these. rub, rub, rub the penis That's shit. slut, slut, whore, slut That's shit. the candy paper sticks -That's shit. what is being happy, what is it? That's shit. Is the costume party up there? - I'm not in costume, asshole. Good evening, could you lower the music? We're celebrating renovations, join us. -Sorry, I have too much work. You're not even in costume. Come in, have a good time. Only to please you then. Wow, you look awake. It was a long night. -I went to bed with a guy ... Nice, interesting, hot. But with tiny hands. When he touched me, I felt fat. Weird, but with his little hands he gave me a huge complex. I have news about that singer, Theophile. -And? He is dead. -How did that happen? Killed himself last week. -Even before he was known? This sucks. -Don't worry, he jumped off a bridge and didn't suffer. I don't care. I'm the one who will end up under a bridge soon. only you, no one other than you Why not do that? -What? You remember the Singing Priests? -Horrible. Well, it was a hit. Instead of 3 priest ... we do a priest, a rabbi and an imam. I'm not joking. Hold on. Religious things are risky these days. No, we do need religion. We would take three preachers, singing French classics. I once worked with a rabbi. What was his name again? Samuel Feldstein, Feldman, Goldstein ... -Some Jew then. With a great voice, but he suddenly disappeared. Perfect, we have to find him. Gentlemen. Excuse me. So you guys smoke joints? Excuse me. Who is there? -Mr Feldmenstein? Are you from ISIS? Nicolas Lejeune, Demanche Music producer. I want to discuss a project with you. Hi. How did you find me? We know people in the music industry. Come on in. We are all a little sick. A nasal spray with water from the Dead Sea... in Israel. When I feel weak, it gives me energy again. I'm listening. We are working on a big music project. A rabbi, a priest and an imam. Who sing together. This is beautiful. -Awesome. I was lead singer a few years ago in the 'Magic Rabbis' band. The? -The Magical Rabbis. Of course, great. The Magical Rabbis. You're awesome, thanks. And now I want to hear a very loud Mazel tov for Cynthia and David. We performed continuously. Mazel tov. at bar mitzvahs ... galas ... I was a star among my people. Until... Okay, give me the scalpel ... Watch out, I'm going to cut. Over there? I can not do anything since that day. My people completely avoid me. Forget culpability. We need such a project these days. Sorry. We're listening. I want to sail to Djerba smell the perfume of its mechouia and in the city the fritters of Hammamet they are just as tasty as her chops chole, chole, cholesterol A rabbi, a priest and an imam, together on stage to sing. And why not also a Buddhist? -Yes, why not? And Amish people. They are nice. With horses, carts and beards. And a djellaba, just like us. - That goes too far. You're right, that goes too far. shalom for you, baby I feel your G-spot I'm going to .. you I am your man, shalom I'm your man, shalom I'm your man, shalom An imam, a priest ... and a rabbi. Together the stage, to sing about living together. What a nice project. Bring cultures and religions together. I need to think of esthetics too. Let me call you back. Inch' Allah. -Shukran (thank you). La shukran ala wajib (no need for thanks). People who perform or listen to profane music... turn into frogs and shrimps. -Who said that? It is written. -Where? On page 112. But that's 'Merlin, the Wizard'. - Indeed. Who are you anyway? -Kader Abdel Kader. I mean your real name? -François Georges. Great. -I'm from Meudon. Dad, I'm sure you're going to be with mom again. That's sweet, honey. What kind of music is that? -No idea, it was on the floor. Thank you. Good evening. What a concert! -Thank you. I have not heard anything so good in a while. -That's so nice to say. Nicolas Lejeune, Demanche Music producer. What do you want? -I want to introduce you to a big project. A priest, an imam and a rabbi singing together on stage. In these times... -Are you serious? What am I doing in this? -The imam. Do I look like an imam to you? Honey, do I look like an imam? You smell of alcohol! There you go. Look, I sent a demo tape so I get my solo album produced. Can you give me a solo album? -No, but in times of religious tension ... So long, pal. find your presence in our life hold a lighted lamp choose with you confidence love and know you are loved meet your gaze while in doubt burn due to the echo of your voice open when you knock on my door break the locks of fear burn when the fire becomes ashes leave for the one who waits choose to give without taking celebrate the return of a child Good day, Father. Nicolas Lejeune, Demanche Music producer. Sabrina, my assistant. -Hello, Father. You have a beautiful voice. -Thank you. I want to present you a musical project. Do you remember the Singing Fathers? I do, but that was awful. -Thank you. In these times of religious tension, I propose: Not three fathers ... but a priest, a rabbi and an imam. That is undoubtedly a wonderful initiative ... but I am a priest. Show business is not for me. Your voice is a godsend. It's a sin not to share it. Singing in the house of God is singing for the good of everyone. Have a good Sunday, see you soon. What now? -Nothing. We have no priest, no rabbi and no imam. We need God's help. Some more announcements before we part ways. Cakes are sold outside for the non-profit A Smile... for Madagascar. Are not you ashamed? My mother is 70 and you do that? We do our work. Pay your debts, and everything will be fine. Don't worry Mom, everything will be fine. How? Will you get a job before we're thrown out? Hold on, Mom. Okay, here. Are we good, now? Don't worry. They can take everything from us... except our dignity. These are standard contracts for beginning artists. Initial and sign, please. Very good, very good ... And the restoration of the roof of the church? That is necessary. Otherwise the bishop does not agree. -Everything is in there. Feels strange to sign another contract. My grandfather gave me the love for singing. I want to add a clause: an advance of 20,000 euros. Cash, if possible. -Okay. Then I also add a clause. You do not drink alcohol as an imam. What if part of the proceeds were for a school in Madagascar? What is that clause? -My grandfather had a fur trade. And a part for Emmaus ... -We could do a lot. We can save the whole planet with contracts. Just sign. At least a beer before the show? We can sponsor a choir. Or wine? You can not refuse that. In France. Do you know how many trees are cut? -White wine? It is lighter than red. Help Haiti. -A caipiroska? Africa. -A caipirinha? Populations are displaced. Bangladesh. -A punch? Deported. -Fight against Ebola, cholera. A glass of cider. -AIDS. At least a Panaché? - Are you going to sign or what? Okay, I'll sign. Banning alcohol, that is not allowed by the Quran. You look magnificent. -I look like a tram conductor. Salaam aleikum. Aleikum salaam. What is this? And throw away all those liquor bottles. Cover your breasts, Madam. Let me. Come visit me at the mosque. What a superpower you have with this hat. Stop smoking kiddo, that's bad for you. Fuck your mother. -Exactly. What's the point of being jewish if you do not have a lift? Nicolas Lejeune. Rabbi Samuel, how are you? -It's alright. This is Imam Moncef Bel Khacem. Brother. I am very happy, brother. -Me too. Our communities must meet each other. When will our war end? -When? When? -When? Inch' Allah. I couldn't say it better. Can I talk to you? Go ahead, I'll close the door. I'll close the door. -Of course. We can't go through the neighborhood with him. -Why not? Who not? He' so ... So what? He is rabbi, he is Jewish. - But this one is enormously Jewish. You are a band now, Make an effort. Rabbi Samuel, we are ready to ... -Sshhh. Amen. I prayed for you. -Awesome. Let's get Father Benoît. 'Let's go', as they say in the USA. My brother. -My Father ... Ah no, that's the other. According to the GPS, it must be here. Where is that priest of you? Hopefully nothing happened to him. I saw a newsreport about rapes in the countryside. Horrible. Dead friends, here I am. Come. Father Benoît. -Good day, Nicolas. This is Rabbi Samuel. -Good day, brother. And this is Imam Moncef Bel Khacem. -Dear imam ... Everything good? -Excellent, and you? All the better. Come. I had my calling here 10 years ago. I thought it would be nice to start our adventure here. Great idea. -Amazing. My dear fellows, I understand that you are not practicing anymore? Indeed, after an unfortunate event I could no longer follow my calling. He cut the dick of a child. But you remain a man of faith. Right, my dear imam? Of course. Where was your mosque? In the ghetto. -In the Val-de-Marne. Yes, in district 9-4. The 'Jacques Brel' mosque (famous French singer). Arabic humor. Even more fun than Jewish humor. -I don't think so. No, no. Gentlemen, the studio is waiting. -No, let's pray. Each in his own liturgical language, to bless this project. Excellent idea. -Liturgical? He means in Latin, in Hebrew and in Arabic. Okay, liturgical. -Brothers. That was very strong. Dear rabbi ... Dear imam ... -It's your turn. My turn ... -Your turn. Give me your hands, close your eyes. Here we go. Forward. Sana Helwa Ya Gameel (happy birthday). Very nice. -Thank you. You did not said yet how the band will be named? Please turn off mobiles. -Of course. That's me. Excuse me. That was for me. Dear imam you should change ringtone, if you know what I mean. Okay, we're starting again. David, it's your turn. It's Samuel's. -Samuel, your turn. Samuel must indeed begin. Try focusing, there we go. Music. Let's go. It's your turn, Samuel. What is it? -No idea. Samuel. -Hey, Michael. Samuel? - What is he doing now? I can't believe it. I can't do it Nicolas, I'm sorry. - You just had it a minute ago? I don't know why Moncef doesn't like me. But I feel hostility, so I can't work. No, he loves you. He does not even know my name. The world is so mean. You are going to sing together to change that. I saw a newsreport yesterday on TV. They have all been exterminated. The greatest genocide in history. Deads, deads, deads ... -The Shoah was 70 years ago. I think about it every morning, but now we have to move on. I'm talking about baby tortoises. Baby tortoises? Who crawl out of the sand to go to the sea. They are devoured by the crabs. By birds, gulls ... Even fishes participate. Everyone eats them. We look calmly, but it never stops. We just let it happen. Where is your nose spray with water from the Dead Sea? In my pocket. -Get some. Get some. Take a deep breath. One more time. Other nostril now. We are in Israel, in Eilat, at the Club Med. knowing to smile at an unknown passerby keeping no memories of it except of pleasure knowing to love without asking anything back neither respect or great love not even the hope of being loved but knowing to give give without taking only learning learning to love learning without waiting love to take everything learning to smile only for the gesture without wanting more and learning to live and to leave but knowing to give giving without taking only learning learning to love to love without waiting love to take everything learning to smile only for the gesture without wanting more and learning to live Shit. Shit. Shit. This is pissing me off. -What are you doing, Moncef? Why am I the only idiot on a donkey? Horses are Arabic. Why are they with the Jew and the Gallic? - There are donkeys everywhere in Marrakech. Great. Then put Benoît on a pig. Listen, Moncef. Jesus spent more than 40 days in the desert, in great need. If you want, I give you my horse. -It's okay. Half of the music video is done. Can I talk to you? We are all pretending to go to Jerusalem. Then I do not need a horse, because if I live in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The vicinity of Palestine. -Yes, Israel. Not Israel, it was always Palestine. - Don't get started. She is right. I won't get into it. Let's calm down. But it is our country, we were there first. -No, the Australopithecus. As if he was first everywhere: in Israel, in France, everywhere. Are we going to debate now? Where are you first? In couscous? Now, that's a car for music videos. But that chick ... -Good day, Madam the director. What a surprise. It surprises you that I care about my business? No, not at all. But your father ... -I'm not my father. I'm the Director. Of course, Madam the Director. Meet the band 'Coexister'. Shalom, Madam the Director. Salaam aleikum, Madam the Director. Hello, Madam the Director. We say 'hello'. And this boys and is going to make our shareholders rich? And you are? -Sabrina, assistant to Nicolas. You looks like a great boss. -Really? Thank you. This is Radio Shabat, with the Coexister band. A priest, a rabbi and an imam, together for the greater good. I start with Father Benoît. What is your relationship with the Jewish faith? What binds Jews and Christians, is the old testament. Do you have a memory of harmony between the two communities? My trip to Jerusalem, during my study. A unique spiritual experience. - Thank you, Father. And you, Imam Moncef? -Yes? What binds you to the Jewish community? For me, that is 'Rabbi Jacob' (French comedy from 70s). -Rabbi Jacob? I love Rabbi Jacob. I have seen the film 15 times. When De Funès starts dancing ... Imagine him dancing ... With his legs ... And then ... And then that scene that he says: 'Solomon, are you Jewish?' 'Are you Jewish?' You clearly see that he is Jewish. Thank you, Imam Moncef. A great movie. Of course. -This one scene ... In a street, he can't read hebrew. He says: 'Welcome to Goldenberg'. That's a restaurant. This is still Radio Catho, with the Coexister band. There is a listener on the line. Hello, I'm Sylvie. I am 72 and I come from Bordeaux. I find the symbolism of your band very beautiful. Thank you, Sylvie. I recently participated in a protest against homosexuals. You mean gay marriage. Exactly. We were protesting together side by side: Catholics, Jews and Muslims. It was a very nice message of love... to protest against the homosexuals. Against gay marriage, Sylvie. I have a grandson, infected by this disease. Thank you, Sylvie. Let's stop here. Keep fighting. We'll heal your grandson, Sylvie. Godspeed. He'll be normal again one day, I mean. This is even worse. -Let's continue ... Still with our guests. You just said it was important ... that religious leaders come together, and not just during crises. It is very important to come together in moments of joy and happiness ... not only during tragedies. We can not say that often enough. We should not generalize. They are not Muslims. They are barbarians, terrorists. Yes, exactly. We do not really know who they are. Those passports in the rubbles of September 11, that was puzzling. Like those IDs from the terrorists in their cars. Just like those rear-view mirrors, that change color. First they are white, then gray. We all know that these are plots from the US secret services. Internet is not much better, only 32 views on YouTube in 15 days. Have you tried radio and TV? If it's not a hit, it does not interest them. People do not want to see us together. They want war. I saw a documentary yesterday. This is the Third World War. This time it won't be millions of deaths, but billions. The problem is that our advertising is worthless. So what? I just said what I think. What's next? You talking about headscarf or burkini? My mother always wore a headscarf. In a civilized society, men ought to have self-control instead of women covering themselves. Say that to the nuns. - It has nothing to do with it. We live in a Christian culture. -Jewish-Christian ... No, Christian. The French kings were not Jewish. What a shame, better to have your dick chopped off than your head. Very funny. -This one is laughing. Can't you help finding a solution instead of arguing? Why not... Why not make a sex tape? Not with Benoît or Samuel, but with me. I can sacrifice myself for the band. You're filming me while I fuck two or three blondes ... We put that on internet. It will be a huge buzz. 'The imam's sex tape' We could do a fake vide. Not this, but something to promote them on social networks. Good idea. -No way. I won't participate in a lie. -Benoît ... If a small lie can save a great symbol? - Then without me. on a Sunday morning were all my parishioners were at the mass they were clapping their hands, drinking wine it was cheerful on a Friday night in the dark, Sabbath with the whole family the electricity was out, our hearts were shining on the evening of Eid with the whole family everyone at home his gaze is empty and there are tears in his eye that poor sheep My god, a fight. Stop, stop. You with the Beret, why are you looking for a fight? He does not, this one has started. Why would not the have Jew started? -Stop you morons. You, get lost. Stop filming. You can't see the Jew is attacked? -Why not the other way around? That was the intention. -It's a fake video. There is currently a lot of Islamophobia in France. That has nothing to do with it. In 2016 there were 812 anti-Semitic incidents versus 211 Islamophobic ones. If an Arab is stabbed twice, then he'll file a police report. But a Jew, you put a chewing gum in his hair ... he's going to human's rights court. And terrorist acts, it's us maybe? Excuse me? Excuse me? - Brothers, brothers, take it easy. Shut up, Father. You're like these Blue Helmets who never actually do anything. My religion is at least peace-loving, unlike some. What do you mean? - Catholics are tolerant. We share our meal with everyone. Especially with little boys. - Very funny. How dare you? You have collaborated with the Nazis ... and endorsed slavery. When are you not the chosen people anymore? We are sick of it. You are both against me. -I will tell you something else: The Jews were the ones financing slavery. Let me remind you of something. The Arabs started it in year 622. Do not touch me. -I do what I want. I can also fight. -Stop already. Oh my God. - Well done. Are you okay, Nicolas? -Put your arms out. Breathe through your nose. -Get closer. Give me your hand. -Do not touch me. Why did you do that? - He said: 'Do not touch me'. Come here, Nico. I never want to see your face again. Long live the secularization. You told me to change my ringtone... -I don't care what you do anymore. Even tell them the truth. -What truth? Nothing. Do not let your anger get the upper hand. Jesus said ... I don't care. You are so full of your shitty religions of peace and love ... but no one takes a step towards each other. Forget me, we're done here. Salaam, shalom ... -'Goodbye', we say 'goodbye'. Yes. Get lost. Nicolas ... I do not need them to co-exist. I exist by myself. Ham sausages from Auvergne ... This one. -Thank you. I'm not buying this one. It's for a friend of mine, a colleague from the office. Off to the office. If this man is not an imam, that is great news for Islam. That's for sure. Are not you cold, without your djellaba? It is not what you think. -Don't bother, Moncef. Okay, I've never been imam. That does not matter anymore. Maybe I am not religious, like you... but you did not co-exist better than me. Don't judge me. He is right. -Indeed. Well... Gentlemen, I apologize. I also apologize to you. Here we go. Finally. What do we do now? And you? I also apologize. Very well? What do we do now? I wanted to ask you something, Moncef. -Go ahead, friend. When we first met in the forest, and we prayed ... What was your liturgical prayer then? It was 'Happy birthday'. -I knew it. I knew something was strange. Come on. You're a pain, Nico. What happened? Find another band if this does not work. I have no more time, and no ideas. -It will be fine. What are you doing? Can I sleep with you? - Do not start again. I need you. -I prefer you leave. Go on. Can I sleep on the sofa? -Please. Here are your things. Go ahead, go. I love you. -Good evening, Nicolas. Oh God, I can't believe it. They are everywhere. -There he is. Moncef, Moncef ... -I love it. What are you doing here? -We have decided something. It's over for me, guys. We came to such a place to tell you something important. Sit down. How did you know I was here? -Sabrina told us. Look at the Jewish guy who rats out. -Stop with anti-Semitic jokes. Stop with anti-semitism, it wasn't. Gentlemen, gentlemen, do not start again. -Enough with you, Father Morality. That fits me well, Father Morality. Look at my face. Shall we leave? -No, brother. We're not moving. I wasn't asking you. You have to be able to test your faith. Jesus resisted temptation 40 days in the desert. She can do what she wants. It does not bother me. Anyway, we were thinking... No, my faith is stronger. Enough, now. Can we chat in peace? Anyway... What do you want, guys? -You were right. Coexister could not work because we could not live together. Good for you, but the band is not a hit anyway. We have to do things differently. Moncef ... Moncef, please. The cabaret venue? -Yes, the venue. The venue where I usually perform, will let us play a few times. I would compose the music. -I would play the guitar. And I would write the text. Some things need changing ... -Nothing. It's perfect. Let us prove to you we can do things together. Let music come out of our ass. Our heart, I mean. Nicolas ... Start again. François comes back late from his tiring job It will have to go together later on with 'Muslim'. Music comes from his apartment. -Escaped? Escaped from his apartment? -No, that's bizarre. Rising. Music is rising from the next door neighbors. Very nice. Bravo, Father. -Thank you, Sabrina. It's very good. François comes back late from his tiring job music is rising from the next door neighbors. François curses his neighbor he believes to be Muslim David stumbles over relics between the mess on the stairs David curses his neighbor he believes to be Catholic somewhere in France, in a misloved street all those people live who never talk to each other go a little way together do a small effort and reach out to each other we have to live together living together let us learn to live together we have to wake up living together we have to live together let us learn to live together we have to wake up Imam Moncef, father Benoît and rabbi Samuel. Thank you for coming. What a beautiful symbol. You there together on the stage, soon at the Olympia. This whole adventure was impossible without Sophie Demanche. Thank you, Michel. Living together in diversity, that is what the Demanche group stands for. Asshole. Tell me honestly, did you know immediately that it would work? Yes, I immediately saw their enormous talent. Their emotions, their feelings ... I knew immediately ... Can I say something? -I have not finished yet. We especially want to thank Nicolas Lejeune and Sabrina. It is their project. -They are our producers. As a way saying ... -Thanks to them, my church is being restored. As a way saying ... Keep mind that togeter, you can achieve anything. If I can say something ... - Maybe one day we'll build ... not a church, but a cathedral. A synagogue. A mosque. That is difficult. -Amen, salaam, shalom. How are you, Sabrina? -Very well. Small meal. -Thank you. You start in an hour, okay? -Super. Is that kosher? -Yes, it's poultry. Thank you, Sabrina. This is the most beautiful day of my life. That's great. See you later. Okay, ciao. Moment. Moment, I am naked. A moment. Yes? -On stage in 15 minutes? I am ready. Don't drink too much. Moment. Pardon, Ben. I mean Father. On stage in 10 minutes? -10 minutes. See you soon. The big moment. -Yes Yes. I have never been so nervous. Start with the right button, or you'll have to redo it all. I see why priests don't fuck. Chick is already gone by the time you remove all the buttons. Very Funny. Let me explain something to you. A cassock has 33 buttons, because of the age of Christ. Thank God he didn't die at 90. -How so? Then they would be 90 buttons. -Nico. We have a problem with Samuel. Come. What is happening? You're all on stage in 5 minutes. Why, Nicolas? -Why what? It is kosher. -I have done 1000 circumcisions. I made the most beautiful glan penises of Paris. I do not know what happened. -Don't get started now. Why he? Why can I be happy... while that poor guy must cry every night. -It was an accident, Samuel. You have to move on. He's not a lizard, it won't grow back. I promise you we will give part of the proceeds to victims of failed circumcisions. But we have to move on now. Where is your water from the Dead Sea? -There is no point. Cut mine off, please. If you are my friend, cut mine off. Cut mine off. Do you have a minute? -I have other concerns. Precisely because of that. Give him that. How did you get that? -From a technician to help with this mess. I will not give cocaine to a rabbi. -Do you prefer to cancel the concert? Let's pray, let's pray. Come on, guys. Lets pray. Pray what? -Before we go on stage. Let's hold hands. Oh my god, how beautiful we are. You're so beautiful. In the name of all gods and all religions, let's be a hit in Nice. Let us tonight part the Mediterranean. Let us tonight walk on the Mediterranean. Let us tonight cross the Mediterranean Sea. Come on. Amen, salaam, shalom, hallelujah, let's go. Other way to the stage, Samuel. we can not do anything against your tanks we have only a few chords against your guns we play our violins your submarines, your aircraft carriers we sink them with our songs and even under rubbles this chorus will echo go ahead, declare your wars together we will be a barrier Go ahead, kill all your brothers even in our grave we will sing Good evening, France. Everything good? Great. Can you send it to me for memories? -I do not have your number. Take it: 06-19- 37 ... -00-99. No, it's not 00-99. A little respect, whore. He is a man of the church. Come on, Father. The atmosphere is a bit spoiled. But who will make it good again? Uncle Sammy. Are you Jewish? -No. From now on, you are. I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier with the fan. Of course. Come in, my child. I am ashamed, I do not know what happened to me. I can become somewhat possessive with my artists. I was about to go to sleep. I hardly slept last night. Me neither. I brought a guy home last night... Sorry, Father. I do not know why I'm telling you that. It's okay to talk if you need to. I'm not going to confess. I am not very religious. But sometimes I can not sleep alone, this scares me. So I sleep with all kinds of men, even if I do not really want to. Yesterday I liked one guy, but I ended up with the other. The last time that happened to me, I banged them both together. You do something like that when you are a nymphomaniac. It's logical. -Yes. I do not know what I have. I must be a bit deranged. No? You did a threesome? -I did worse. A foursome? How does that work? Do not be too hard on yourself, my child. Please stop calling me 'my child'. I never talk to my father about such things. Did you consider not giving yourself right away to all these men? To preserve some self-respect? You likely won't find the answer tonight. But it's proven that abstinence can light your mind. For sure, there won't be a 'guy' tonight. That's for sure. Good night, Benoît. -Good night, Sabrina. Good night. Think of Jesus. He resisted 40 days in the desert. 40 days. Good evening, can you call a taxi? -Of course, immediately. The 'Midnight' is open tonight, right? -Of course. Are you nuts? -Shouldn't you be an imam? Take it easy. -Where are you going? You can not smoke in the room. -Don't think I'm stupid. I have been doing this work for 20 years. Thanks buddy. Is he the one who sold me out? Bravo, the receptionist. Why be stars if we have to lock ourselves in our hotel like idiots? Are you a star now? Where is this star? What does the star want? Go to a nightclub? Go to a swinger club? Do you want a women? Men, do you want men? -I do not know. Stop, are you nuts? You want men, all right. You are totally gay actually. What do you want? -Go inside. I will not let you fuck me. For the rest of the tour, you sleep in my room. Let's exchange our keys. Then you can order drugs and prostitutes. Then they think it's for me. Thank you, thank you. The key. Thank you, Nico. I will not disappoint you. All right, Samuel? -No, I didn't sleep all night. I'm worried. Me neither. The mattresses are terrible. I'm exhausted. Those mattresses suck. I feel better already. Good morning, friends. -Hello, Benoît. Hi Benoît. -Good day, Father. I slept like a baby last night. Like or with? Oh, that's funny. I bet he brought back that fan from yesterday evening. Leave him alone. -The one who kissed him on the mouth. You'll have to tell your bishop. -Why would I have done something like that, Samuel? I didn't think so. And that's why I worry about you priests. He's right. You touch yourself, right? It's not only for peeing. It has two functions: peeing and YouPorn. You've done YouPorn, right? That's funny. He's doing it. -Totally. Are you done? I'll avoid blasphemy ... but I can also do that kind of jokes. These strings on your belt ... Is that to take off or fart? Okay, that was lame. François comes back late from his tiring job music is rising from the next door neighbors.

Are they together again? Officially not, but keep this secret: His wife comes to surprise him tonight. -This is good news. Do not say anything. This kind of small twists. -Samuel... Let's toast to the end of the tour, and to the Olympia tomorrow. Mazzeltof, mazzeltof. I want to thank the production for offering my first five stars hotel. I do not care about that if we are together. Five stars or one star. As long as no one is putting it on your chest. Benoît ... That was a very good one. A very good one. To the first successful joke from Benoît. What do we do now? -Let's go out. No, everyone stays here. -Fuck. Let's go fucking out. We need some fun. What else should I do? Hi Benoît. -Am I interrupting? No, come in. I wanted to thank you for everything you did during the tour. It's not much, but please. Cute. It is huge. Thank you. I would also like to thank you for your advice. Abstinence during the tour was great for me. I'm proud of you. -It's like... It is as if I was a virgin again. Christ teaches us self-respect. Know how to say 'No' to a man. Jesus resisted the devil's temptations for 40 days in the desert. Father ... Good evenving. The room of Nicolas Lejeune? -Just hold on... Room 239. -Thank you. Good evening. -Housekeeping already came, I don't need anything. I am Miranda. -Miranda? No, I do not think so. You are Nicolas, room 239? -That's not the problem ... This is the Miranda I booked. I had to color my hair. Come on. I have to work. -It is more than just color. Wait... Very good, Nico. Keep it up. Keep going, keep going, keep going. 40 days, 40 days, 40 days ... 40 days, 40 days ... Nico, Nico ... Did you try to talk to her? -She does not want to hear anything. After what happened before ... I'm very sorry, Nico. -It's not your fault. I swapped that room with you. Good morning everyone. I'm hungry like a wolf. A wolf? Great atmosphere here. Is the Olympia exciting you like this? He had a fight with his wife. Did you not like her surprise? You knew? Warn me next time. I'm very sorry. -We'll talk about it later. We have to go. Where is Benoît? -No idea. I do not sleep with him. I mean, I'm not his mother. He left the hotel this morning. -That is impossible. We have an important show tonight. -He took a cab at six. Where to? -I could not say, Madam. Still voicemail. What could have happened? It may be a Catholic holiday. Epiphany, or whatever. -This is not the time, Moncef. It is my fault. -What is your fault? I slept with him last night. Are you kidding? You slept with Benoît? He threw himself on me and I ... You already fuck every men. Now also men who are now allowed? You are so going straight to hell. - Please, Moncef. You sleep with a different prostitute every night. I do not know what's worse. I am the only one who did not go to bed with a promiscuous woman. Fuck off. How was your cocaine from the Dead Sea yesterday? Better cut than your last circumcision? What cocaine is she talking about? I have no idea. There's cocaine in it? Sorry. I had to give you a boost. Unbelieveable. Fuck. You gave cocaine to a rabbi? You're going straight to hell with her. Benoît, Benoît ... What now? -We have no choice. We have to cancel the concert. Stop it, it's a church. Are not you coming, Sabrina? -I do not want to make another mistake. We were getting worried. Sorry friends, I could not warn you. I got away from God during this tour. I am a priest, not a rock star. No worries. I get that you have to pray for a moment. Not just a moment. I won't play tonight. Think about the audience. I gave my life to Jesus, not to the public. 2,000 people are coming tonight for you to give them strength. Is not that the nicest way to show your love for Jesus? I slept, I slept with Sabrina. We all slept with weird bitches. It does not matter. -No, it does matter. It was so good. It was so good. -What did she do to you? Everything. -You made a mistake, so what? I also regret everyday my mistake. And I? All those prostitutes during the tour. I even suspected that one ... But Sabrina, it's everything but a mistake. I love Sabrina. More than anything. More than Jesus. This priest knows how to enjoy life. He's going to take her again. You see, that gives me a boost for a concert. I do not need this shit anymore. Bye drugs. Hurry up, get it back. Are you here, Olympia? Olympia, first we want to thank someone ... without whom nothing would have been possible tonight. Our friend and producer: Nicolas Lejeune. Make some noise. Listen to your heart tonight, and not to your anger. Listen to your heart and not to rumors. Listen to your heart and not to gossip. Because it is always in our hearts that you find the truth. let us learn to live together we have to wake up living together let us learn to live together we have to wake up Take a picture, take a picture. You are the champions. Mr. Lejeune, what a success. -Thank you. Amazing. I am proud of you. Do you mind introducing me? Sorry, honey. This is Catherine, my partner. You wonder that sometimes. The stadiums will be full tomorrow. Mr. Lejeune ... -You said? The band will be a massive hit. -Thank you, but without me. I will start my own label. Do you remember Sabrina, my assistant? She will be a perfect boss. Good evening. ONE YEAR LATER A drink, Moncef? -No, I do not drink anymore. I even started to pray, for self-control. Thank you. What a beautiful baby. Maybe we should also make one. -Oh, honey ... I just became co-producer. To Coexister, now produced within the family. Mazzeltof, mazzeltof. To celebrate the birth of the kid ... let me offer you the best circumcision in the world. Thank you, but our son will not be circumcised. Not at birth, Samuel. We do it on the eighth year. -On the 20th is even better. If God has given us a foreskin. cutting him off is mutilation. It is more beautiful, it prevents diseases ... It is only a tiny thing. Just a small cut. -What an idiot. No no no...
