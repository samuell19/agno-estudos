Somebody asked me today: "Phil, if you could be anywhere in the world, where would you be?" I said to him, "Probably right here... ...Elko, Nevada." Our nation's high at 79 today. Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow... ...gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. In the Pacific Northwest, they'll have some... ...very, very tall trees. Clear across the Rockies and Great Plains. But look out, here comes trouble. Oh, boy! Front coming our way! Look out! What will that mean to us? One of these big, blue things! This cold, frigid arctic air, this big mass out of the north. It'll meet up with all this moisture coming up out of the Gulf. They'll mix at high altitudes and cause snow. Going out on a limb: Not gonna hit us here in Pittsburgh. Gonna push off and hit Altoona. Close call! Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney... ...for our country's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd... ...if the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow... ...we've got six more weeks of winter. So cross your fingers. Sounds like fun. You must really enjoy it. This is your third year in a row. Four, Nan. - Four. - Thanks, Phil. Next, our entertainment editor looks at sex and violence in movies. Stay with us. - And we're clear. - Have fun in Punxsutawney, Phil. For your information, Hairdo, a major network is interested in me. Yeah. That would be the Home Shopping Network. Thanks, Larry. Go wait in the van, will you? That was nice, Phil. "Big trees"! Stop, Kenny. Look, can you handle the 10 or not? Yeah, yeah. If you don't want to rush back, I can do the 5 tomorrow. Come on, I wanna stay an extra second in Punxsutawney? Please! Look, Rita thinks it'd be a great idea... ...to stay for some of the other events. Get some incredible footage. The people and the fun. The excitement. You haven't worked with her yet, have you? She's really nice. I think she'll be a really good producer. You guys are gonna have fun. She's fun. But not my kind of fun. I will be here for the 5. Rita! Can you keep a secret, Larry? I'm probably leaving PBH. So this will be the last time we do the Groundhog together. What's wrong with the Groundhog Festival? In San Diego... ...I covered the swallows returning to Capistrano six years in a row. Someday someone will see me interview a groundhog, think I have no future. I think it's a nice story. He comes out. He looks around. He wrinkles up his little nose. He sees his shadow, he doesn't see his shadow. It's nice. People like it. You are new, aren't you? You know, people like blood sausage too. People are morons! Nice attitude. Look in the mirror and see how you look when you do that groundhog thing. For me? Once? He comes out, and there he looks at his little shadow. Want some blood sausage? I have some here. I like blood sausage. Rita, I can't stay here. - Prima donna. - It's okay, I'll handle it. - What's the matter? - I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago. I was miserable. It's a fleabag. - I won't stay here. - You're not staying here. - I'm not? - No. Larry's dropping me off. I booked you in a nice bed-and-breakfast on Cherry Street. Great. I think this is one of the traits of a really good producer. Keep the talent happy. Anything I can do. Would you help me with my pelvic tilt? Within reason. Want to come to dinner with Larry and me? No, thank you. I've seen Larry eat. You get your sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Don't be late. Did he actually call himself "the talent"? Okay, campers, rise and shine! Don't forget your booties. - It's cold out there! - It's cold every day! - Is this Miami Beach? - Not hardly! Expect hazardous travel later today with... ...that blizzard thing. That blizzard thing. Here's the report. The National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing. There's another reason today's especially exciting... Especially cold. The big question on everybody's lips... - Their chapped lips. - On their chapped lips. Do you think Phil will come out and see his shadow? - Punxsutawney Phil! - That's right, woodchuck chuckers! - It's Groundhog Day! - Groundhog Day! Get up and check that hog out there! Come here, groundhog! - Morning! - Morning. - Off to see the groundhog? - Yes, I am. Think it'll be an early spring? I'm predicting March 21 st. Good guess! You know, I think that actually is the first day of spring. - Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? - I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster. Would you like some coffee? Is there any possibility of getting an espresso or cappuccino? I really don't know... How to spell espresso or cappuccino. This looks fine. I hope you enjoy the festivities. - Yeah, I'm sure I'm going to. - There's talk of a blizzard. We may catch a break and it will blow right by. The moisture coming out of the south... ...by midday will push on to the east. At high altitudes it'll crystallize and give us what we call snow. Probably be some accumulation. Our high will get to about 30 today, teens tonight. Chance of precipitation, about 20 percent today, 20 percent tomorrow. Did you want to talk about the weather or just chitchat? - Chitchat. - Okay. I'll see you later. Bye. Will you be checking out today? Chance of departure today: 100 percent. Phil? Hey! Phil? Phil? Phil Connors! I thought that was you! - How you doing? Thanks for watching. - Hey, hey. Don't tell me you don't remember me. I sure as heckfire remember you. Not a chance. Ned! Ryerson! Needlenose Ned. Ned the Head. Come on, buddy. Case Western High! I did the whistling bellybutton trick at the talent show. Bing! Got the shingles real bad senior year. Almost didn't graduate. Bing again! I dated your sister a couple times till you told me not to anymore. Well? - Ned Ryerson? - Bing! Bing. So did you turn pro with that bellybutton thing, Ned? No, I sell insurance. - What a shock. - Do you have life insurance? If you do, you could always use more. Am I right or am I right or am I right? Right, right, right? Ned, I would love to stand here and talk with you. But I'm not going to. See you. That's all right! I'll walk with you. Whenever I see an opportunity now, I charge it like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. I got friends who live and die by the actuarial tables. I say, hey, it's all one big crapshoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single-premium life? That could be the ticket for you. Oh, God! It is so good to see you! What are you doing for dinner? Something else. It's been great seeing you, Needlehead. Take care. Watch out for that first step. It's a doozy! Hey, Phil! Phil, over here! Where have you been? It was horrible. A giant leech got me. You're missing all the fun. These people are great! Some of them partied all night long. They sing songs till they get cold. Then they go sit by the fire and get warm. And then they come back and they sing some more! Yeah. They're hicks, Rita. So did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? You're incredible. Who told you? Okay. It's groundhog time. Okay. On me in three... ...two, one. Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn to this tiny hamlet... ...to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil... ...the world's most famous weatherman. The groundhog. Who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. So the question we have to ask ourselves today is: "Does Phil feel lucky?" Every year, the guy comes out with a big stick and raps on the door. They pull the little rat out, they talk to him. The rat talks back. Then they tell us what's gonna happen. Isn't he cute? Hey. Do you like your guys with prominent upper teeth? No. This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...the seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... ...emerged reluctantly but alertly... ...in Punxsutawney, PA... ...and stated in groundhog-ese: "I definitely see a shadow." Sorry, folks. Six more weeks of winter. On me in three, two, one. This is one time where television really fails... ...to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel... ...predicting the weather. I for one am grateful to have been here. From Punxsutawney... ...this is Phil Connors. So long. Okay. Want to try it again without the sarcasm? We got it. I'm out of here. Prima donnas. Oh, boy. Take a look at this. What is going on? I don't know, Phil. Perhaps it's that blizzard we're not supposed to get. This is impossible. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Nobody honks this horn but me, okay, pal? No, no! Take this rig out of here. Hey, commander, what's going on? Nothing. We're closing the road. - Big blizzard moving in. - It's a couple of flakes. Don't you listen to the weather? We got a major storm. I make the weather. All this moisture from the Gulf will push off to the east in Altoona. Pal, you got that moisture on your head. You can go back to Punxsutawney... ...or you can freeze to death. It's your choice. So, what's it gonna be? I'm thinking. Come on, all the long-distance lines are down? What about the satellite? Is it snowing in space? Don't you keep a line open for emergencies or for celebrities? I'm both. I'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through on that line, please? Could I have one more of these with some booze in it, please? - Oh, I like it here. - Phil. Going to the groundhog dinner? No, I had groundhog for lunch. Wasn't bad. Tastes like chicken. You two run along. Wow, Larry. Looking foxy tonight, man. Hey. Is your troop gonna be selling cookies again this year? That's so funny, Phil. So, what are you gonna do? I think I'll go back to my room... ...take a hot shower and maybe read a little Hustler. Suit yourself. Oh, boy. Yo, Mom. Isn't there any hot water? Oh, no, there wouldn't be today. Of course not. Silly me. Sweet dreams. Okay, campers, rise and shine! Don't forget your booties. - It's cold out there! - It's cold every day! - Is this Miami Beach? - Not hardly! Nice going, boys. You're playing yesterday's tape. ...With that blizzard thing. That blizzard thing? Here's the report. The National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing. There's another reason today's especially exciting... Especially cold. The big question on everybody's lips... - Chapped lips. - Their chapped lips. Do you think Phil will come out and see his shadow? - Punxsutawney Phil! - That's right, woodchuck chuckers! - It's Groundhog Day! - Groundhog Day! Get up and check that hog out there! Come here, groundhog! What the hell? Morning! Off to see the groundhog? - Yeah. - Think it'll be an early spring? Didn't we do this yesterday? I don't know what you mean. Don't mess with me, Pork Chop. - What day is this? - It's February 2nd. Groundhog Day. Yeah. I'm sorry. You know, I thought it was yesterday. Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? Did I sleep well? Like some coffee? Yes, please. I think I'll have a double. I hope you enjoy the festivities. There's talk of a blizzard. Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster? I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen. No, that's okay. Thank you. Will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? I'd say the chance of departure is 80 percent. Seventy-five, 80. Excuse me! Excuse me. Where's everybody going? To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day. It's still just once a year, isn't it? Hey! Phil? Phil? Hey! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! My, oh, my, Phil Connors! Don't say you don't remember me. I sure as heckfire remember you. - Well? - Ned Ryerson? Bing! First shot right out of the box! So how's it going, old buddy? I'm not feeling well. Would you excuse me? It's funny you should mention your health. Guess what I do now. Do you sell insurance? Bing again! You are sharp as a tack today! Do you have life insurance? If you do, you could always use more. Right! I mean, who couldn't? But you wanna know something? I gots a feeling... ...you ain't got any. Am I right or am I right or am I right? Am I right? - I gotta go. - Phil... Watch out for that first step. It's a doozy! Phil! Phil, over here! - Where have you been? - Rita. Do me a favor. I need someone to give me a good, hard slap in the face. - How's that? - Good. If you need help with the other cheek, let me know, I'm right here. Something's going on. - Are you drunk or something? - Drunk's more fun. Can I be serious with you for a minute? I don't know, can you? Yes, I'm being serious. I'm having a problem. I may be having a problem. - Rita, Rita. - It's groundhog time. See? I knew you'd say that! I really feel weird. Let's just do this, Phil. Then we'll talk. All right, on me in three... ...two, one. Well, it's Groundhog Day... ...again... ...and that must mean we're up here at Gobbler's Knob... ...waiting for the world's most famous groundhog weatherman... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...who's gonna tell us how much more winter to expect. Phil, Phil, Phil. This is a riot! Isn't he cute? This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil, the seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... - ...emerged reluctantly... - Phil! ...but alertly in Punxsu... Oh, my gosh! Yeah, sport, I know there's a blizzard. When will the long-distance lines be repaired? Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today. Hello? Hello? Morning! Off to see the groundhog? Did you sleep well, Mr...? Hey! Phil? Phil Connors! I thought... Hey, Phil. Don't say you don't remember me. I sure as heckfire remember you! It's me, Ned! Ryerson! Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head! Case Western... Hey. Hey, look... Hey! Phil! Phil, over here! - Where have you been? - Can I talk to you? It's not work-related. - You never talk about work. - We have to talk. - Hey. - It's a creative meeting. - We've got work to do. - No, I don't. I've already done it twice. Now, when you get finished, come and meet me in the diner. Phil... - What's that all about? - I don't know. Prima donnas. More coffee, hon? No, thanks. Just the check, please. These sticky buns are heaven. Aren't they? Just put that anywhere, pal! Yeah! Good save! Tell me why you're too sick to work. And it better be good. Rita, I'm reliving the same day over and over. Groundhog Day. Today. - Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line. - No. Really. This is the third time. It's like yesterday never happened. I'm racking my brain trying to imagine why you'd make this up. I'm not making it up. I am asking you for help. Okay, what do you want me to do? I don't know! You're a producer. Come up with something. Want my advice? You should get your head examined... ...if you expect me to believe a stupid story like that, Phil! Phil? Like the groundhog Phil? Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil. Look out for your shadow, pal! Morons, your bus is leaving. You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather. - Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh. - I'm not going back to Pittsburgh. - Why not? - Because of the blizzard! I thought you said it was gonna hit Altoona. Yeah, I know that's what I said. Phil, I think you need help. That's what I've been saying, Rita. I need help. Well, no spots. No clots, no tumors. No lesions. No aneurysms. At least none that I can see. If you want a CAT scan or an MRI, you'll have to go into Pittsburgh. I can't go into Pittsburgh. - Why can't you go into Pittsburgh? - I told you, there's a blizzard. Oh, right. The blizzard. You know what you may need, Mr. Connors? A biopsy. A psychiatrist. That's an unusual problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples, families. I have an alcoholic now. You went to college, right? It wasn't veterinary psychology, was it? Didn't you take a course that covered this stuff? Yeah. Sort of, I guess. Abnormal psychology. So... ...what do I do? I think we should meet again. How's tomorrow for you? Is that not good? I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster. Drank piña coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day... ...over and over and over? You know, some guys would look at this glass and say: "That glass is half empty." Other guys would say, "That glass is half full." I peg you as a "glass is half empty" kind of guy. Am I right? What would you do if you were stuck in one place... ...and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered? That about sums it up for me. Good luck. I'll drop you off. This thing sticks a little bit. You got to jiggle it... Come on up here, pal. Give me your keys, pal. Give me the keys. Friends don't let friends drive, right? Stand up here. Take a deep breath. You feel okay? Really? Okay, you're all right. You wanna throw up here or you wanna throw up in the car? I think both. Come on. I don't think I should be driving. No. No. I don't either. Watch your head. Watch your knees. Don't break anything. All right. Hey, let's not forget seat belts. Hey, who else could go for some flapjacks right now? Let me ask you guys a question. Shoot. What if there were no tomorrow? No tomorrow? That would mean there'd be no consequences... ...no hangovers. We could do whatever we wanted! That's true. We could do whatever we want. Hey, Phil, if we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive! Hey. Hey, Phil. - I think they want you to stop. - Hang on. It's the same thing your whole life: "Clean up your room. Stand up straight. Pick up your feet. Take it like a man. Be nice to your sister. Don't mix beer and wine, ever." Oh, yeah. "Don't drive on the railroad tracks." Phil, that's one I happen to agree with. I don't know, Gus. Sometimes I think you just have... ...to take the big chances. This is the police. Pull over immediately. Hey, we're talking in here! - Phil... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet he swerves first. Phil? Phil! I'm not going to live by their rules anymore! I noticed that. You make choices and you live with them. My knee. Let me handle this. Yeah, three cheeseburgers, two large fries... ...two chocolate shakes and one large Coke. And some flapjacks! Too early for flapjacks? Yes! Rise and shine, campers! Don't forget your booties! It's cold out there today! It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? Not hardly! Slept like a baby, thank you. I'd love some of your coffee. - I hope... - Flurries moving in later... ...but the blizzard's gonna hit outside of town. Mrs. Lancaster, was anybody looking for me here this morning? Perhaps a state official? Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick? No, no one like that. Will there be? Apparently not. Will you hold my room for me? I'm gonna stay an extra day. Catch you tomorrow, Pops. Hey! Phil? Phil? Hey! - Phil Connors! - Ned? I like to see a man of advancing years throwing caution to the wind. It's inspiring, in a way. My years are not advancing as fast as you think. More coffee, hon? Just keep it coming. Sure thing. Just put that anywhere, pal! Yeah! Good save! Don't you worry about cholesterol, lung cancer, love handles? I don't worry about anything anymore. What makes you special? Everybody worries about something. That's exactly what makes me so special. I don't even have to floss. What? The wretch, concentered all in self Living, shall forfeit fair renown And doubly dying, shall go down To the vile dust from whence he sprung Unwept, unhonored and unsung Sir Walter Scott. What, you don't like poetry? I love poetry. I just thought that was Willard Scott. I was confused. You think I act like this because I'm egocentric? I know you're egocentric. It's your defining characteristic. You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather. Thanks, Larry. Would you like a doggy bag? I'm gonna stay and finish. I thought you hated this town. It's beginning to grow on me. Larry, quit staring. These are excellent. Hey, did you see the groundhog this morning? I never miss it. What's your name? Nancy Taylor. And you are? - What high school did you go to? - What? High school. Lincoln, in Pittsburgh. Who are you? Who was your 12th grade English teacher? Are you kidding? No, in 12th grade, your English teacher was... - Mrs. Walsh. - Mrs. Walsh, yeah. Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh. - Okay. Thanks very much. - Hey... Hey. Nancy? Nancy Taylor?! Lincoln High School! I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class. - I'm sorry. - Phil Connors! - That's amazing! - You don't remember me, do you? I even asked you to the prom. Phil Connors? I was short and I've sprouted. Yeah. How are you? Great. You look terrific. You look very, very terrific! Listen, I gotta go do this report. Are you a reporter? A weatherman with Channel 9, Pittsburgh. I should have known. That's great! But maybe later we could... Yeah, whatever! Stay right here. - Promise me? - Yes. - I'll be right back. Wish me luck. - Okay. Good luck! Oh, Phil. Oh, Rita. Who's Rita? How should I know? What is this, some kind of one-night stand? On the contrary, Nancy... ...I love you. I've always loved you. This is gonna seem sudden, but... ...Nancy, will you be my wife? Oh, Phil... Rita. - Nancy. - Whatever. A gust of wind. A dog bark. Cue the truck. Exit Herman. Walk on to the bank. Exit Felix, and stand there with a not-so-bright look on your face. All right, Doris. Come on. - Hey, fix your bra, honey. That's better. - Hey, Felix! Felix! How you doing, Doris? Can I have a roll of quarters? Ten, nine, eight... ...car... ...six, five... ...quarters... ...three, two... - Felix. - What? - Did I bring out two bags or one? - I don't know. I thought we were going to a costume party. It's like I said, I love this film. I've seen it over 100 times. Phil! Told you... ...call me "Bronco." Sorry, Bronco. Hi, Nancy. My own fiancée... ...doesn't remember me. - Hi. - Hi. That'll be one adult and... - Two adults. - Two adults, I guess. ...Groundhog who, as legend has it, can predict an early spring. So the question we have to ask ourselves today is: "Does Phil feel lucky?" Rita, if you only had one day to live... ...what would you do with it? I don't know, Phil. What are you dying of? No, I mean, the whole world is about to explode. What do you do? I just wanna know where to put the camera. What are you looking for? A date for the weekend? No, I'm just interested in you. What do you want? What do you like? What do you think about? What kind of men are you interested in? What do you do for fun? Is this for real, or are you just trying to make me look like a fool? I'm trying to talk like normal people. Isn't this how they talk? - Close. - Okay, so talk to me. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. - And a doughnut. - All right. So, what do you want out of life, anyway? I guess I want what everybody wants. Career, love, marriage, children. Are you seeing anyone? This is getting too personal. I don't think I'm ready to share this with you. How about you? What do you want? What I really want is someone like you. Oh, please. Why not? What are you looking for? Who's your perfect guy? First of all, he's too humble to know he's perfect. That's me. He's intelligent, supportive, funny... Intelligent, supportive, funny. Me, me, me. He's romantic and courageous. Me also. He's got a good body, but doesn't have to look in the mirror often. I have a great body, and sometimes I go months without looking. He's kind, sensitive and gentle. He's not afraid to cry in front of me. This is a man we're talking about, right? He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers. Does he have to use the word "poopy"? And he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother. I am really close on this one. Really, really close. It's Phil Connors. Hello. Thanks for watching. So, what are the chances of getting out today? Van still won't start. Larry's working on it. Wouldn't you know it? Can I buy you a drink? - Okay. - Jim Beam, ice, water. For you, miss? Sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist, please. What are the chances of getting out today? Van still won't start. Larry's working on it. Wouldn't you know it? Can I buy you a drink? Okay. Sweet vermouth, rocks, with a twist, please. - For you, miss? - The same. That's my favorite drink. Mine too. It always makes me think of Rome. The way the sun hits the buildings in the afternoon. What should we drink to? To the groundhog! I always drink to world peace. Can I buy you a drink? Okay. Sweet vermouth, rocks, with a twist, please. For you, miss? The same. That's my favorite drink. Mine too. It always makes me think of Rome. The way the sun hits the buildings in the afternoon. What should we drink to? I like to say a prayer and drink to world peace. - To world peace. - World peace. - This is wonderful! - See? Didn't I tell you? How do you know so much about Punxsutawney? I spend a lot of time here. Small-town people are more real, down-to-earth. - That's how I feel. - Really? - Some white chocolate? - Yuck, don't make me sick. No white chocolate. There is something so familiar about this. Do you ever have déjà vu? Didn't you just ask me that? People place too much emphasis on their careers. I wish we could all live in the mountains, at high altitude. That's where I see myself in five years. How about you? Oh, I agree. I just like to go with the flow. See where it leads me. Well, it's led you here. This is about a million miles from where I started out in college. You weren't in broadcasting or journalism? Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. What a waste of time! I mean, for someone else, that'd be an incredible waste of time. So bold of you to choose that. It's incredible. You must be a very, very strong person. People place too much emphasis on their careers. Gosh, I wish we could all live in the mountains. At high altitudes. That's where I see myself in five years. - How about you? - Oh, I agree. I just like to go with the flow, see what happens. Well, it's gotten you here. It's a million miles from where I started out in college. Oh, yeah? You weren't in broadcasting or journalism, anything like that? Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. You speak French. Catch up. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Me neither. It's fun! It's good, clean fun. I hope that one day I can do this with my own children. Where'd you get that? Well, I went over to the snowman shop. Hey, an assassin! I'll protect you, your majesty. I shall die for you. You shall not take her! Find cover, my lady! Yeah! Hey, nice arm. I'm getting some good ones. Hey, there's a boy. - That's a boy! Good try, son. - Wait up! Help me! What? I'm just amazed, and I'm not easily amazed. About what? How you can start a day with one kind of expectation... ...and end up so completely different. Well, do you like the way this day is turning out? I like it very much. It's a perfect day. You couldn't plan a day like this. Well, you can. It just takes an awful lot of work. Come on in. I wanna show you something. - I don't think I should, Phil. - I agree. That's why I'll show you this one thing, then kick you right out. It's just lovely. Would you like to sit and stare at the fake fire? Okay. It's really a wonderful room. It is now. I don't know, Phil. I don't think we should do this. I don't either. On second thought, I think we should. It's the perfect end to a perfect day. Well, it's a little fast for me. Me too. Maybe I should go. Where would you go? Why? We've got a perfect fire. I've got some French poetry here. Baudelaire... I will read to you. I've got some ice cream over on the windowsill. Hold on a minute. - Rocky road? - Oh, I love rocky road. Yeah, I thought so. You have to stay. No, really, Phil, I'm tired. We can see each other tomorrow. No, tonight. It's gotta be tonight. No, Phil, really. Come on. Just stay for a while and if you like it, stay longer. And if you like that, stay longer. Let's not spoil it, okay? I don't want to spoil it either. You know I can't stay with you. Why not? I love you. - You love me? - I love you. - You don't even know me. - Oh, I know you. I know you. Oh, no. I can't believe I fell for this. This whole day has been one long setup. - No, it hasn't. - And I hate fudge. No white chocolate, no fudge. What are you doing? Are you making some kind of list? Did you call my friends and ask them what I like? - Is this what love is for you? - No, this is real. This is love. Stop saying that! You must be crazy. I could never love you because you'll never love anyone but yourself. I don't even like myself. Give me another chance. That's for making me care about you. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Me neither. It's fun! And good, clean fun too. That's what's missing in the world. Gosh, I can't wait to do this with my own children. Golly, I want kids. Lots of kids! I want to adopt, I want my own kids, I want to have foster kids. I got this over at Snowman City. Hey! Some kid just threw a snowball at us. Come here! Let's have some fun! Come on, hey! Hey, kids, come on! I wish these were my own kids. Hey! Hey! Are any of you up for adoption? Hey, here's a humdinger over here! Hey. Wasn't that great? Stop it! Phil! Over here! Where have you been? You're missing all the fun. Phil, you look terrible. What happened? Rough night? Yeah. Okay, campers. Rise and shine. Don't forget your booties, because it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. This country's largest lake, Chapala... ...is located near the city of Guadalajara. What is Mexico? - Leslie. - What is Mexico? - Correct. - Lakes and Rivers, 400. Seneca is the largest of these lakes in west-central... - ...New York. - What are the Finger Lakes? - What are the Finger Lakes? - Correct. - This South American lake in Bolivia... - What is Titicaca? - What is Titicaca? - Correct. For 1000. - Milky-colored... - What is the Rhone? ...When entering Lake Geneva... ...this river is clear blue upon exiting. - Jim? - The Rhone? Good for $1000. You're $500 off the lead right now. Let's go to Inventors for 200. This is pitiful. A thousand people... ...freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat. What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out, and they used to eat it. You're hypocrites! All of you! You got a problem, Larry? Untie your tongue. Come here and talk. Am I upsetting you, princess? You want a prediction about the weather? You're asking the wrong Phil. I'll give you a winter prediction. It's going to be cold. It's gonna be gray. And it's gonna last you for the rest of your life. Once again the eyes of the nation have turned here to this... ...tiny village in western Pennsylvania. There is no way that this winter... ...is ever going to end... ...as long as this groundhog keeps seeing his shadow. I don't see any other way out. He's gotta be stopped. And I have to stop him. Real good, Phil. Real good. He's out of his gourd. I'm worried. I think there's something really wrong with Phil. Yeah. There's a lot of things really wrong with Phil. Oh, hi, Phil. I've come to the end of me, Rita. There's no way out now. Just remember, we had a beautiful day together once. All right, little fella. Good job. He just smiled at me! Did you see that? I believe he did. Okay, little fella. There you go. Hi there, mister. Something I can do you for? Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Hey! Get the word out. Somebody kidnapped Phil! We're going after him! Why would anybody steal a groundhog? I could probably think of a couple reasons. Pervert. - He must have just snapped! - This ought to be good. What is he doing? What can he be thinking? Not bad for a quadruped. Check your mirrors. The side of your eye. Side of your eye. That's it. That's it. Hey, they're chasing us! Come on, make it fun. Don't drive angry. Don't drive angry. Hot dog! There's no way out except the way we came in. We got him now! - What the hell is he doing? - I don't know. If you gotta shoot, aim high. Don't hit the groundhog. We mustn't keep our public waiting. It's showtime, Phil. On me, Larry, in three... ...two... ...one. Phil. He might be okay. Well, no. Probably not now. Nuts. Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? Would you like some... ...toast? Oh, my God. That's him. He was a really, really great guy. I really, really liked him a lot. I'm sorry? What was that again? - I'm a god. - You're God? I'm a god. I'm not the God, I don't think. Because you survived a car wreck? You folks ready to order? I didn't just survive a wreck. I wasn't just blown up yesterday. I have been stabbed, shot, poisoned... ...frozen, hung, electrocuted, and burned. Oh, really? Every morning I wake up without a scratch, not a dent in the fender. I am an immortal. Special today is blueberry waffles. Why are you telling me this? Because I want you to believe in me. You're not a god. Take my word for it. It's 12 years of Catholic school talking. I can come back if you're not ready. How do you know I'm not a god? Oh, please. - How do you know? - Because it's not possible. I'll come back. Doris. This is Doris. Her brother-in-law owns this diner. She's worked here since she was 17. She wants to see Paris... - ...before she dies. - Boy, would I! - What are you doing? - Debbie and her fiancé, Fred. Do I know you? They're supposed to get married. She's having second thoughts. What? Lovely ring. Bill's been a waiter for three years, since he left Penn State to work. He likes the town, paints toy soldiers and he's gay. I am. Gus hates it here, wishes he'd stayed in the Navy. I could have retired on half pay after 20 years. Excuse me. Is this a trick? Maybe the real God uses tricks. Maybe he's not omnipotent... ...he's just been around so long he knows everything. - Who's that? - Tom. He worked in the coal mine till it closed. - And her? - Alice. Came from Ireland when she was a baby. Lived in Erie. He's right. - And her? - Nancy. Works in a dress shop, makes noises like a chipmunk when she gets real excited. - Hey! - It's true. - How do you know these people? - I told you, I know everything. In about five seconds, a waiter's gonna drop a tray of dishes. - Five, four, three, two, one. - This is nuts. - Okay? - Okay, that's enough. What about me? Do you know me too? I know all about you. You like producing... ...but hope for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh. Well, everyone knows that. You like boats but not the ocean. You go to a lake in the summer with your family in the mountains. There's a dock and a boathouse with boards missing from the roof... ...and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone. You're a sucker for French poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous. You're kind to strangers and children. And when you stand in the snow, you look like an angel. How are you doing this? I told you. I wake up every day. Right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2nd. And there's nothing I can do about it. If you still can't believe me, listen: In 10 seconds... ...Larry is gonna come through that door and take you away from me. - But you can't let him. - Larry? Please believe me. You've got to believe me. You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather. What's that? "... To stay ahead of the weather." Maybe it really is happening. How else could you know so much? There is no way. I'm not that smart. Maybe I should spend the day with you... ...as an objective witness, just to see what happens. Gee, this sounds like a science project. Concentrate. You gotta want it. You've gotta want it, Rita. Come on. It's more in the wrist than the fingers. You just gotta... Be the hat. Come on, go. - It'd take me a year to get good. - No, six months. Four to five hours a day, and you'd be an expert. - Is this what you do with eternity? - Now you know. That's not the worst part. What's the worst part? The worst part is that... ...tomorrow you will have forgotten all about this... - ...and you'll treat me like a jerk again. - No. It's all right. I am a jerk. No, you're not. It doesn't make any difference. I've killed myself so many times... ...I don't even exist anymore. Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes. I don't know, Phil. Maybe it's not a curse. It just depends on how you look at it. Gosh, you're an upbeat lady. I want you to know it's been a really nice day for me. - Me too. - And maybe... ...if it's not too boring, we could do it again sometime. I hope so. You're still here. I thought you were supposed to disappear. Or I was or something. Not until 6. You rat! I never said midnight. You knew I was waiting for midnight. Are you gonna leave? No. Good. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. It's all right. You can fall asleep. I promise I won't touch you. Much. It's all right. I'm not tired. What were you saying? I think the last thing that you heard was: "Only God could make a tree." Really? What I wanted to say was... ...I think you're the kindest... ...sweetest, prettiest person... ...I've ever met in my life. I've never seen anyone... ...that's nicer to people than you are. And the first time I saw you... ...something happened to me. I never told you... ...but I knew that I wanted to hold you... ...as hard as I could. I don't deserve someone like you. But if I ever could... ...I swear, I would love you... ...for the rest of my life. Did you say something? Good night, Rita. Good night, Phil. Okay, campers, rise and shine! Don't forget your booties. - It's cold out there! - It's cold every day. - Is this Miami Beach? - Not hardly! Who wants coffee? Get it while it's hot. - Thanks, Phil. - Larry? Skim milk, two sugar. Yeah. Thanks, Phil. - Pastry? - No. We're just setting up. Pastry, Larry? Take your pick. Thanks, Phil. Raspberry. Great. I talked with Buster Green, he's the head groundhog honcho. He said if we set up over here, we might get a better shot. - What do you think? - Sounds good. Larry, what do you think? - Yeah. Let's go for it. - Good work, Phil. Maybe we'll get lucky. Let me give you a hand. No, no. You got your coffee. I'll get it. Thanks. We never talk, Larry. Do you have kids? - Yes? - Yes, I'd like a piano lesson, please. I'm with a student. But if you want to come back tomorrow... I kind of wanna get started. I could give you $1000. Come on in. Morning! Off to see the groundhog? You think it's gonna be an early spring? Winter, slumbering in the open air Wears on his smiling face A dream of spring Ciao! Ciao! Phil! Rita, hi. Hey, Lar. Hi. How's she look? - Great! - Thank you. - Did you know he could ice-sculpt? - No. Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say this is your first lesson? Yes, but my father was a piano mover, so... Phil? - Phil Connors, I thought it was you. - Ned Ryerson. I have missed you so much. I don't know where you're headed, but can you call in sick? I gotta get going. It's good to see you, Phil. Hello, Father. Let's get you someplace warm, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Remember me? Excuse me, sir? You brought the old man in? How is he? Well, he just passed away. - What did he die of? - He was just old. It was just his time. - I wanna see his chart. Excuse me. - Sir! Sir, you can't come in here. Sir, this is a restricted area. Where's the chart? Sometimes people just die. Not today. Gets hard down there at the bottom. Here you go. Thank you. Come on, Dad. Come on, Pop. Come on, Pop. Come on. Come on. Come on, breathe. Breathe, Pop! Breathe, Pop! When Chekhov saw the long winter... ...he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney... ...and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts... ...I couldn't imagine a better fate... ...than a long and lustrous winter. From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors. So long. Nice speech, Phil. Very nice. Thank you. - Thanks. How was that for you two? - Hey, man, you touched me. - Thanks, Larry. - Thank you. - I gotta go. Okay? - Phil. That was surprising. I didn't know you were so versatile. I surprise myself sometimes. Would you like to get a cup of coffee? I'd love to. Can I have a rain check? I've got some errands I've gotta run. Phil? Errands? What errands? I thought we were going back. Hold it, fella! What do you say? What do you say? What do you say? You little brat. You have never thanked me! I'll see you tomorrow... ...maybe. - Now what? - You totaled it. - It's only a flat tire. - What are we going to do? - It's an earthquake! - Oh, it's not an earthquake. What is it? Thank you, young man. It's nothing, ma'am. I had the tire and the jack. Just be comfortable. It'll be a minute. Who is that? He must be from the motor club. He is having a heart attack! Do something! Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer, doctor, anything! I think that did it. - You okay? - Yes? If you're gonna eat steak, get some sharper teeth, all right? - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Who was that? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh, yes. - Are you sure? Eat, eat, eat! People don't understand... ...what is involved in this. This is an art form. I think that most people just think... ...that I hold a camera and point it at stuff. There's a lot more to it than just that. Hey. Would you be interested in seeing the inside of the van? You know, I really have to get back to the party. Great idea. I think I'll go with you. Let me just drop the tip here. Okay. - Rita! Hi! How are you? - Hi! - Rita, this is Nancy. - Hi. Nancy, Rita. We were gonna go to the party. You going? Yeah, sounds like fun. Maybe we should call Phil. Phil Connors? I think he's already in there. Great. - Isn't he good? - He's great! He's my student. I'm so proud. Thank you. Hello, welcome to our party. Phil, I didn't know you could play like that. Oh, I'm versatile. It's that nice young man from the motor club. Thank you again. It's nothing, ladies. He's the fastest jack in Jefferson County. What was that all about? I really don't know. They've been hitting on me all night. There you are! I never thanked you properly for what you did for Buster. Well, he would've choked for sure. Well, he may have. He was trying to swallow a whole cow. I owe you one, buddy. Hang on to him, dear. He's a real find. What did you do today? Oh, same old, same old. Excuse me, Mr. Connors. Hey, Fred. How was the wedding? I wanted to thank you for making Debbie go through with it. All I did was fan the flame of her passion for you. - You are the best. - No, you're the best. - Rita, this is Debbie and Fred Kleiser. - Hi. - Here you go, kids. Congratulations. - What is this? Oh, no way. No way! - WrestleMania! No way! - Yeah! How did you know? We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway! Thank you. You're a real pal. Oh, this is the best. I don't understand. Yeah, I guess not. How does everyone know you? You come here once a year. You're the most popular person in town. - Excuse me, Dr. Connors? - Yes? I want to thank you for fixing Felix's back. He can help around the house again. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Felix. Dr. Connors? It's kind of an honorary title. - What is going on? - I really don't know. No, there is something going on with you. You want the long or short version? Let's start with the short and go from there. Okay, folks, attention. Time for the big bachelor auction. Now, you all know the rules. All the eligible bachelors, come down in front. And you ladies... ...you bid on them! Do whatever you want with them... ...no questions asked! I don't wanna know about it, as long as it's legal. Get out your pocketbooks, and remember it's all for charity. Phil! What are you doing down here? Go on, get up there. I got 10 bucks that says you're mine. Hey, Buster, I got your first victim. Phil Connors, come on up here! All right! Now, what am I bid for this fine specimen? Five dollars! The bidding has begun at $5. Ten dollars! Fifteen! - Twenty! - Twenty-five! Thirty! - Thirty-five! - Forty! Forty-five! Fifty! Fifty-five! Sixty! I'm bid 60. Do I hear more? $339.88. I don't think we're gonna accept any more bids. I think that's sold... ...to the little lady for $339.88! Congratulations! Okay, bachelors, who's next? All right! Now, what am I bid for this guy? Do I hear a buck and a half? Anybody? 75 cents? I bid two bits! Sold to the lady for 25 cents. I got him! How old is she? Phil? Phil? Phil Connors, I thought that was you. Rita, this is Ned Ryerson, he's my new insurance agent. I'll say. I have not seen him for 20 years. He comes up and buys whole life, term, fire, auto, dental, health... ...with the optional death and dismemberment plan. Water damage. Phil, this is the best day of my life. - Mine too. - Mine too. - Where are we going? - Oh, let's not spoil it. Let's not... I got that. Why can't I look? Because you bother me a lot. I'm getting cold. How long do I have to sit here? I'm giving you your money's worth. You paid top dollar for me. Well, I think you were a bargain. Sweet of you to say. You're probably right. Is it finished yet? Almost. I still have to put cherry syrup on the top... - ...and then we can eat it. - Come on, Phil. I'm freezing! One second, one second. Let me turn it in the light. It's amazing. It's beautiful. How did you do that? I know your face so well, I could have done it with my eyes closed. It's lovely. I don't know what to say. I do. No matter what happens tomorrow... ...or for the rest of my life... ...I'm happy now... ...because I love you. I think I'm happy too. Oh, please. Not again. - That is a great song. - It's not. Don't listen to this man... It's too early. Something is different. Good or bad? Anything different is good. But this could be real good. Why are you here? I bought you. I own you. But why are you still here? You said, "Stay," so I stayed. I said, "Stay," so you stayed? I can't even make a collie stay. I gotta check something. Just stay. Stay. They're gone! They're all gone. - Do you know what today is? - No, what? Today is tomorrow. It happened. - You're here. - I'm here. Oh, Phil. Why weren't you like this last night? You just fell asleep. It was the end of a very long day. Is there anything I can do for you today? I'm sure I could think of something. It's so beautiful! Let's live here. We'll rent to start.
