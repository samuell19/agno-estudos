I'm 68. And I feel like I'm 28. But I sit next to guys on airplanes and a guy has, you know, got a grey suit on. He's lost most of his hair and he's sweating. He goes, "I'm going to be 55 next week." And you look at this guy and go, I'm 20 years older than you, you know, something like that. And you realize that his job, his lifestyle has nearly killed him. The stress of his lifestyle. What if that guy, on the weekends, had a rock and roll band? I guarantee you he'd feel a hundred times better because he has something to look forward to. It would be something that he... While he's doing his stressful job, he's going, "Yeah, but I got to learn the chords to 'Gloria.'" If you've always wanted to be a rock star and come on, really, who didn't? But you listened to your parents when they told you to get a real job, there may still be hope. John Entwistle is the first one to tell me about this fantasy camp. And he said, "Would you do it?" And I thought, "Well, why not?" You know, it just sound like a bit fun. We've all secretly dreamed of being Rock Gods, jamming out in front of adoring fans. Welcome to rock and roll fantasy camp where you'll experience the complete rock and roll lifestyle without the lawsuits and STDs. Woo! STDs! My first thoughts were, "All this seems kind of cheesy." I never dreamed I would ever actually have a food fight with the Grand Funk Railroad. And then an hour later, be eating fish that Ted Nugent caught himself. I couldn't wrap my head around it. I... I had to experience it. You know, I was kind of worried that it might just be like a... - A fan thing. - This camp rocks. I remember thinking, what a great opportunity to get back and work with people from all walks of life. And they're coming here to experience and do something they've never done before in their lives. The hardest I ever worked in one day in my life. Looking forward to another good bashing at rock camp. Be afraid. Be very afraid. I think what's kept the camp around so long is these rock stars, they get a spark. Because it's really about the music. - That's great. - It's pure. Okay. - Hello. - Teddy. It's David. This next song features Mr. Teddy "Zig Zag" "Big Bag" Andreadis, the Greek on the harmonica. Tony, how are you? I'm good, David. How are you doing? - Vinny, you there? - I'm here. Let me tell you about your band. Um, on drums, you got... You got Paul de la Carta. Rob Cohen is a vocalist. I love that Blake Meinhardt. I've seen that kid grow up in camp. - That's cool. - Artists love to give back because they realize that their success is based on the fan. You have Cammy Fisher, who has come to the camp previously as a drummer, and she wants to be a vocalist, this camp. Can you imagine a guy like you going from drums to vocals? You... You'd get more chicks. Well, not the way I sing. I might lose the chicks. Tony, thank you so much. Are you excited about Vegas? I'm looking forward to it. I always... I like working with Paul. He's a great, great human being. Okay, we'll be in touch. - I'll see you in Vegas. - Thank you. Bye. Okay, bye. I grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey, really as a child. So I... I attribute the success being at a young age and, uh, going to synagogue with my father. My father was a cantor and... And I was the only kid there. I learned to talk to people that were older than me, and they looked to help me out, they were just so sweet. You know, I was the Cantor's son. And it really gave me the confidence that I could talk to anyone. It is the huge resort hotel, which is the best bet for the city dweller who is looking in the country for the same amusements he has in town, but with fresh air and sunshine added. The Catskills was a place where we went to camp in the summer. They were places where people would go, two hours outside New York and they would basically take a week and go up there, stuff their faces and they'd go swimming, they'd play bingo. And then every night there was a... A... a show with, uh, a singer and a comedian. Look at that, what he's doing? What do you think the boy was doing? - Sawing a dog in half. - It was camp for adults. I became a waiter in the hotels in the Catskills. My brother's a drummer, he had a Jewish rock band. I wanted to be in the band. I tried, I played one gig on bass. I was so bad. My dad turned to me and he said, "Why don't you go out and book your brother's band and then you can book six other bands at the same time?" Don't become an artist, be an entrepreneur. And here I was booking comedians and singers. When I collect the money after the Saturday night show on Sunday, the owners would take off $25 because the comedian wasn't funny or the singer didn't do a Yiddish song. It got me so frustrated because I knew the show was great. I was there. I'll never forget, uh, Dr. Jay showed up to camp. When I saw 2,000 kids running up to Dr. Jay, I said, "This is the business I want to be in." That's when I became a sports agent. I said, I want to represent athletes instead. David Fishof is an agent who lists Phil Simms, Vince Ferragamo and Hacksaw Reynolds amongst his clients. Basically, I try and negotiate the best contracts possible and get them the most money. Phil Simms, you've just won the Super Bowl. - What are you doing next? - I'm gonna go to Disney World. David, you're, uh, neither an attorney nor a former player. What are your qualifications? Um, I started basically in the entertainment business, and I believe professional sports is in... in its own way, show business. Getting commercials and promotions. I'm going to bring this back to its knees. ♪ Oh-la-la, Sasson ♪ ♪ Oh-la-la, Sasson ♪ I'm sharing office space with different music managers. Earth, Wind and Fire's manager, Meatloaf's manager and record label. Madonna's manager, Shep Gordon, who was representing Teddy Pendergrass at the time, and Alice Cooper, The Ramones. Everyone has gold records on the wall, and I love the creativity about this record they were recording. And so I... I started getting bored with professional sports. ♪ I'm gonna play a song ♪ A little bit of Rock and Roll ♪ My name is Tammy Fisher. You are in Lanoka Harbor in lovely New Jersey, down the shore, as we say. On the home front, I have a wonderful man that I've been married to for quite a long time. I'm a mom. I have two great, beautiful daughters. I'm very, very blessed and very lucky. And I think I have a very good life. ♪ Get down on that ♪ They have a special thing, and I've used it before, it's kind of funny, but it's called Monkey Butt Paste. And literally, yeah, they put it down here so it catches the sweat. I was like, what is this for? If I'm having a really bad day, I'm putting on bandana. Anything to bang my head, to scream. It's the screaming metal, I don't know why. I find solace in the screaming metal. That takes my mind away from the guy who fell asleep next to me on my bus and commute. I've had many people do that. They fall asleep in my lap, fall asleep, drool on my shoulder like disgusting things. I'm an accountant and I work for a pretty high profile public company. It's a... It's a tough job. I'm one of the very few female vice presidents there. I have to make my team feel like I know everything and trust me, I don't. Obviously, you are aware that, yes, our team takes training and development very seriously here to enhance your skill set with regards to variance reporting and analysis. I know. Really exciting topic, right? No claps? Come on. Tough crowd. So how long you've been doing this band camp? Uh, let me see, I'm in my third year and coming up on my fifth camp. Wow. What's your favourite moment? Uh, my... my back massage from Rob Halford. It doesn't get any better than that. Nice, so do you learn a lot with him? Oh my God, I've learned so much. Every single camp, I go there. You know, you get in a room with four other people you don't know, and everybody wants to play a different song. And half of them I never even knew. And it's like, the counsellor will go, "Just wing it, do it." And I've had to learn new songs every single time I go. - Must be hard. - So it pushes me. Yeah, it's scary. Would you rather play drums or sing? I don't know, the singing is new and scary to me. - Let's see. - Okay. - Yeah. - It's going to be tough. Oh, New York is so rock and roll. Everything goes. I see a caped Batman almost every other morning. Running down from Port Authority, you know? You know what? That's rock and roll in my bar. Go ahead. Go for it, Batman. Started the same way for us as it probably is for the rest of you guys. You know, going over your buddies house, smoking some pot and jamming out to a rush record. You can see the fingerprints on the... on the "O." You see those? Those are the fingerprints that were by Jeff Beck. Those are his fingerprints. And under the M, that's Eric Clapton's fingerprints. So that thing is now worth $100,000. ♪ I thought love was... ♪ David Fishof was a mythical character because he was the gentleman who had put The Monkees back together and had helped relaunch them in the mid to late 1980s. You don't want to take credit for the idea? - Yeah, that's all right. - In all... - In all fairness, it was... - Go wide. - Go wide. - Micky, who's idea was it? In all fairness, it was, uh, a guy named David Fishof who in last couple of years has put together a Happy Together Tour, a nostalgic concert show that toured around the country, did very well. David very successfully revived this tour, kind of like thinking outside the box. I don't know what prompted him to do it, made him think that he could be successful doing it. He's had all this success, and you wonder, how much does he really know about what he's doing? Somebody once described David as a guy who took the yarmulke to another level. Now, thanks to MTV and syndication, The Monkees are hot again. Look, he's eating bananas. Is that it? David is the only agent that I know who could say he represented sports figures and a Beatle. David Fisher, he came over to London and he said, uh, "Do you want to go on tour?" I was like, "Let me think." And then I said yes. Well, I met David Fishof in 1989 when he produced Ringo Starr as All-Starr Band in his first tour. And he really did the world a favour. Ringo hadn't toured on his own and now it's, uh, many, many, many years later, and Ringo still tours almost every summer. You know, I'm not a rock and roller. I'm the last guy that... That's a rock and roller. And part of being in rock and roll, it's a lot of hanging time I turned to Ringo after the third show. I remember we were in Buffalo and I said, uh, "I'm going to go home and I'll see you in Chicago in two weeks." And he turned to me he said, uh, "Remember you promised me you're going to be with me?" I said, "Well, that was agent talk. You know, I don't really go on these tours." I remember calling my wife and saying, Okay, I'll see you at home in eight weeks. "I'm going on the road with Ringo Starr." And out on the road, something happened that changed my life. We're backstage for the fourth show of the tour, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons comes over to me at dinner and tell me they're quitting because Joe Walsh and Levon Helm are having a fight. They want me to come and break it up. And I had just mortgaged my home to finance the tour. Yeah, we had a great time. We got him good. - Just chill out. - You think you got it... We had set him up completely. And Levon I were screaming at each other. When he walked in, I pushed Levon and he pushed me back and he took the beer bottle and broke it on his road case. So it was a broken bottle and came over and stabbed me. - Hey! Jesus! - Goddammit man, cut it out. - Come on. - You got a show now. I had fake blood. I started bleeding profusely and David was just... Now wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Come on, man. Come on. Get out of here. I walked away and I said to myself, "Wow, these guys are nuts." But I realized how much fun these guys have. Documented. And that's how I came up with idea of rock roll fantasy camp. What if I could give this to people, to a fan to enjoy and see what it's like to be with all these rock stars? I completely understand why anybody who's never been to a rock and roll fantasy camp would be apprehensive about coming because I was. But I walk into the room and I'm going like, "Wow, this sounds awful, but look at the fun they're having." And behind every young camper, there's always incredibly supportive family. All right. What key is this song in, Blake? It's, um, like it's in E. Great. Music. It has definitely strengthened my and his relationship. If we're in the car, we're driving somewhere, I'll ask him a question and say, "Blake, who produced this album?" And then he'll spit it out. - What key is this in? - It's in E. - It's in E? - Yeah. He knows who the producer is. He knows where it was produced at, at what studio. This one sounds like it's in A. He even knows songs down to the writing credits of, you know, who actually wrote the song. There'll be some obscure, it will be like a Zappa song or something will come up I'm like "He don't know Frank Zappa," and he'll just be... Wow. It's Slash. Blake, at a very young age between, I'd say, three or four, he was diagnosed with autism. - Is it? - Blake got a Alice Cooper doll. As a parent to hear those words it's like, "Yo... what did we do wrong? Blake would not communicate. He didn't really start talking until age five. I mean, he wouldn't say anything. - Find it Blake. - Come on. You look for something to make your child happy. I mean, I played guitar, and Blake would sit on the couch. I would sit there, and I'd start strumming chords. It got to a point where at age ten, he said, I want to start taking guitar lessons. Told my wife, I said, we'll bring him out to Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. You know what better way? Baptism by fire. Throw him out there and just, you know, I mean, I won't put him in harm's way or anything, I said, let's just try and see what he'll do. For starter, uh, boys are back in town and, uh, I just want to jam, man. The transformation has been unbelievable. He lives and breathes music, there's nothing more important. Like that just... It's his world. And he's a hard worker. So that passion clicked in his head and that's why we're here. He's a happy kid. You can't ask for anything more. When I went to the fantasy camp, it was interesting to me, the age group. You would have a 15 year old kid playing drums and a 45 year old dentist on guitar. That's one of the things you have to get past when you sing with these guys. You look around the band, you go, "Wow, if this band were a real band, it would be the weirdest band ever, but cool." We're talking about rock and roll fantasy camp and it's rocking and rolling. I did my first camp in Florida, um, on the beach. All at the Eden Rock Hotel, at a five day, four night, first time ever rock and roll fantasy camp. Dreamed up by a promoter when he was touring with some guy named Ringo Starr. The biggest thing in our business is everyone's scared to be labelled as hip, as not hip. I... I never believe not to do anything because it's not hip. You do something because it's good, it's entertaining, and if you have an idea, you make it happen. That the greatest people can be intrigued by rock and roll. Here's an opportunity for everybody to get a chance to get involved. When I saw the names on the list, when I first saw it, I was like, "All these guys are be in the same place at one time?" These fans, and they are going to say to their friends, You dipstick, you should have been there, I told you. You just want to put this finger on that note. There's this genuine respect and love for the music that we did in those days. All the press came out. About a week later, I'm watching The Tonight Show, and there's Jay Leno and he's doing his monologue. He said, Jerry, hear about this rock and roll fantasy camp they have? He said, "For $5,000, you can jam with a bunch of B rock and roll stars." He said, "For $5,500, you could check yourself in the Betty Ford Clinic and jam with a bunch of A rock and roll stars." We got a lot of press, a lot of media, and we signed up about 15, 20 people. It was such a dreadful experience financially. You know, I chalked it up to, "Okay, I have five great ideas in a row, never going to do it again." And that's what life is as a promoter. You know, you take your chances. Articles were coming out in... In Entertainment Weekly and you were reading about this. One day I got a phone call from Citibank. They wanted to do a commercial. Sam begged and pleaded, so I sent him to camp. We'd earned lots of points with our new Citi Thank You Card. He even hangs out with the camp director. Just like that. Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp kind of just showed up in pop culture. Bones did an episode. Yeah! Gift certificate to Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. Now, what's that? You're going to be singing with Roger Daltrey from the Who. ♪ People try to put us down ♪ I sang with Roger Daltrey. Good job. I can now die. Ellen did it for a comedy show. I'm talking about having fun. I've got a bad song in my head. And with your help, I think we can perform it very poorly in front of people who will pretend just as poorly to enjoy it, because that's what rock and roll fantasy camp is all about. My root beer, Hash. Simpsonswas amazing for us. Hello, campers. One day I was driving to work at The Simpsons and I'm listening to the Howard Stern Show, and he was promoting this thing called Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. Entertainment Weekly has listed it as one of the top 25 episodes. - Paparazzi to the left. - I got them. The whole thing about the rock camp is that I end up learning new things. I mean, a lot of really good players come through, you know, and, uh, rubbing elbows with everybody it's fun on this journey. - Ready to order? - I... I am. - How about the mushroom burger? - All right. They call me Pistol because when I was younger, I listened to a Motown album and I'm like, this is... This sounds great. And keep in mind, I'm in the fifth grade and I'm reading the liner notes and it says, Richard "Pistol" Allen on drums. And I'm like, that's who I want to play like, Richard Pistol Allen. Mind you, knew nothing about drums. I just knew I like that man. Fries are freshly cut. Oh, and the ketchup, fresh. Right off the vine. There's a book that I recall, The Healing Drum. It goes back into Africa and it talks about when children are born into the tribes themselves, they are raised to be master drummers in the tribes. All the communication is... Is done through drums because that is the heartbeat of what we do. We walk in rhythm, we talk in rhythm, we blink our eyes in rhythm. Everything that we do, uh, is surrounded by rhythm. The drummers responsibility in the... in the band is... Is essential. That's my rhythm. See? That's that constant heartbeat. My job is to lock it in and stay there and give them something that they can move to because they feel the rhythm. When I was younger, I went to church with my dad because he was the most important person in my life. - Morning, Fong. How are you? - Hi. I think it's important for us to have something or someone that we believe in. Thank you. Bye-bye now. See you next week. There's been so many opportunities for me to be around people that did drugs, that were in gangs. And I grew up in the heart of that in L.A. A lot of my friends, they became gang members. Uh, they got involved in drugs. And those are things that I just wasn't interested in. Partly so because I saw my brothers and sisters fall victim to that stuff and I saw how much it hurt my dad. And... And I really think it sent him to an early grave. So I, again, I probably still need to work through it. But I have a lot of resentment towards them because they deprived me of the love and growing up with a father. The God had his hand in seeing that I didn't fall victim to that. So somehow he put drums in my life. I really think that if it wasn't for music, I wouldn't be here today or I don't know what I would be doing. Music has gotten me through a lot of things. It's my foundation. You can take anything else away from me, but don't take this away from me. You know, I have to have this. I love it because I always make sure as a counsellor that my band, whether we're good or not, is that they're having a good time. You know, you look at what your band is and you go, "Okay, this person can play. This person can kind of play, this person can sing but kind of can't play." Uh, guy's number one rule of camp is inmates don't run the asylum, right? So you guys, when you take your fans, you take control of them, and in the end, they will thank us. - And, right, Teddy? - Absolutely. You make it work. You know, like, there's no... There's no I in band. Some of this goes way back. First concert ever is up here somewhere. Iron Maiden, March 9th. 1985. This is a memory that I will never forget. I would have been 13 or 12 at the time. I remember my parents who are just... they're very straight-laced and very conservative parents, wonderful parents, by the way. But they really didn't want me to go to heavy metal concerts. They made sure that one of my friends' parents went with us. So we go to this Iron Maiden concert and, uh, I remember, you know, kind of like rocking out. But then I remember looking back and seeing, you know, my friend's mom is just like taking a joint from one of the other people who is in the audience and is like smoking out. And I'm just like, really? This is... this is our chaperone? Uh, so mom, that's true story. The coolest is this poster here, which is me on stage with Judas Priest. This is modelled after a poster that was in my room back in the day, and I had to fight really hard to be able to put heavy metal posters on my walls. Judas Priest finally made it up there. It's a total dream of mine come true. But my mom's in the crowd, like, watching, cheering, so excited, and just to see that moment and think, wow, how life changes. My son comes home from school, and the first thing he wants to do is, "Okay, Dad, I really wanna get a snack, but let's jam that song first." I'll stop anything I'm doing. This is a shy kid. He's only 14. Boy! You know, this metal mad man inside is just a beautiful thing. That's the neat thing about fantasy camp. He got so good, so fast with such little input. When you play with someone who's great at something, like, they are unconsciously excellent at it. It is a different experience. Try yourself. It's a very special thing. I know it sounds a little cheesy that like, "Oh, it's just a rock and roll thing," but man, for me and for him, it's real. - Yeah. - All right. Rock and roll. It took me back to our first starting... In the early band's... I'm talking way, way, way back. It's music in his most honest, uh, format. It's a... It's a weird thing. I'm getting chills thinking about it. That feeling you get when something clicks in the room, that sort of magic, that's why we all do it. This is the man! - Rock and Roll! - Oh, I think I did... Does Gene Simmons... Fishof is a really, uh, interesting character. He could be a character in a recurring role in The Goldbergs. He's... He's just crazy. He's out of his mind. You know? And I love that about him. David, I thought, should be in a mental hospital at some point, you know? Or he has escaped from a mental hospital. But I called up Roger and I said, "Who would you like to jam with? If you had an opportunity to meet your hero? Who would you want to jam with?" He says, "Levon Helm of The Band." He said, "I've always wanted to meet Levon Helm. If you introduce me Levon Helm, I'll do your camp." And we had formed a bond because of the Ringo tour. So when I asked him for something, he said, "Of course, I'll do it." And he came. Wow! What's happening? After he got to meet Levon Helm the next day, he said, "Where are these bands playing?" I said, "Well, tomorrow night, they're playing at The Bottom Line." Roger Daltrey! Okay, let me tune to this. But where's your singer? - You're standing right there. - You're standing right there. Let me tell you, these guys, uh, I'll be down at the rehearsal and watched all the bands, and, uh, it's just great to see people gaining a lot of knowledge about our business that has been incredible to me in my life. And let's just hope that, uh, in some small way, it can be incredible to you for a weekend. Off you go, guys. Once Roger started doing it, all of a sudden it opened up the door and Roger said, "I can introduce you to Brian Wilson." Roger would always call me before every camp, even though he wasn't going to be at the camp. And he was always concerned that the rock star was having a good time, will Brian Wilson like it? And the fact that he was showing interest meant that, you know, that there's something here. It's kind of like on Barnum and Bailey's side. Uh, and... and because it is a circus which Jagger recognized all those years ago. In '69, rock and roll is a circus, David recognized that. And he started to just come up with ideas that keep the spirit of it alive. And we got to give him applause for it. ♪ Man, I can't explain ♪ - There Mr. Fishof. - Come on, bring them here. What do we got here? Rock stars? You know Paul Stanley is not coming. Uh, goodbye. No. No, we got... we... we... we got... We got Gene Simmons'... David, I came to see you. - That's an honest guys. - It's the only reason I'm here. - You excited? - Awesome. I'm very excited. I'm always excited. It's great to see you. It's gonna be great. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. It's gonna be exiting. Glad you came. Hello, David Fishof. As soon as you walk in the door, you get your welcome back. You get into a room with a group of people who feel exactly like you do, and you all know you do, and that just breaks the ice right away. And then, you know, maybe Bruce Kulick will walk through the hallway or something and you'll say, "Hey, what's up, dude?" And you all look at each other and be pinching... You know, and you share that experience so quickly with the group that you're with. You see, everybody gets excited about coming to camp early. You guys say hello of Steven Adler? - Yeah. - Yeah. So you all know Mr. David Fishof. This guy is the creator of Fantasy Camp, which is one of the coolest things. One guitar player was shredding like a mother and I'm thinking, "What are you?" He goes, "I'm a doctor." I'm going, Wow. You have, uh, some kids who come here, you know, their parents buy them the camp. They're, you know, lawyers and doctors and business people like myself. Some people, they saved up for this camp. This is a once in a lifetime experience. I am a Director of Compliance for a Medicare health plan back in Portland. I was a partner in a copy machine business, I'm a chiropractor now of almost 20 years. Just finished my 30th year teaching junior high and high school choral music. I was an executive, pretty senior executive at Motorola. I've been married almost 20 years. We've got, uh, four kids. I work for the railroad. I'm a conductor. So I haven't been on a regular vacation since we always come here. Yeah. People often would say, "Tell me about yourself." I tell them, "What I do is I'm an executive at Motorola. I am a rock guitarist." Hello, everybody. Welcome to Alcoholics Anonymous. I mean, oh, I'm sorry, this Rock Fantasy Camp. - You guys having fun so far? - Yeah! Please welcome... Gene Simmons. Hey. Wow, everybody, welcome to Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. This is our 23rd year. 23 years. And if you see a group of stars over in... Walking around and you have a question about bass, ask Rudy, ask... If you... If... if you want to ask a question about sex, ask Vinny. Okay? Okay. Go to your rooms. We're gonna start jamming right away. Good luck, everybody. God bless you. Here's opening day at Rock Camp. Are you ready to rock? Your mission at camp. Number one, you got to prepare two sets. I don't care if you do identical sets. It's about helping each other, coming together as a unit to be the best band possible. And... And the best band here... The best band wins absolutely nothing. Nothing, nothing. I can do that. I can do that. - Yeah. - I tell you where he is. So it's always a distressing moment when I meet my band, my camp band for the first time. - Wow, you guys sound great. - Thanks. - I'm Tony. - Hi, Quinn. Quinn? Hey, Quinn. Nice to meet you. You must be Blake then. - Yes. - Okay. - You must be Tony. - I am Tony. At least the last time I checked. Uh. Well, it's nice that you guys know it, wow, I'm quite impressed and a little intimidated actually. Oh, you know what I forgot to tell everybody? To come up with the name of the band. Let's see, I had the Daughters of Danger. Oh, big fan of the Horse Chestnuts. Stack of Yokels is my favourite band name. - On the top three. - One, two, three. Motley Jue. Oy. - Vey. - Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, Jurassic Waist Band. - What was the name you picked? - Which one? - The F one. - Fustagates. Fustagate. - What? - I told you how would... None of us know what the hell it means. - Oh, the name? - You hear Fustagate, you go... - What's that word? - Fustagate. - Yeah, I've never heard. - It means to beat with a club. - Oh, nice. - How about Menopause? Can we just throw that out there? Menopause? Men 'O' Pause. See? That was my name. There you go. - And you're for it? - I think it's funny. - I think it's great. - You're all right with that? I'm okay with that. I think it's funny. Okay, the name of the band is... We gotta come up with a new band name that's like, you know, naming your son again. You know what I mean? It's... But that... that STP sticker was a really cool logo that we had on a bicycle seats or on a skateboard, so we're thinking like, Stinky Toilet Paper. Sherley Towels. What are we going to come up with? And, you know, the Stone Temple Pilots seemed to be the most accurate one. Yeah, no one told me metal guys was silly. I love it, though, may I say? I'm glad you're taking the positive out of that. All right. "Mississippi Queen." Hey, Pistol. What's going on? - Good to see you. - Good to see you, man. - Thanks for coming. - My pleasure. So Super Kick Ten, let's... - Uh, what sizes? - 14. Lenny Kravitz and I, we... we hooked up by accident when we were in high school, we played together for about three or four years. Actually, I was supposed to be on the Let Love Rule album, but I decided to take a gig in Edinburgh, Scotland. And by the time I came back, the album was all done by Lenny. You know? So I missed that boat. -I like it -Well, awesome. I'll take everything. Wrap it up. Thanks buddy. Always good seeing you. All right, ladies, let's go. I wanna show you something. Alright. Fall in... Fall in line. Come on, fall in line. I want to show you guys how it all begin with me in terms of learning to play drums. My very first, uh, teacher was Willie T. Brooks. I owe everything to him. He was the beginning of it all. Then I met Albert "Tootie" Heath of the Heath Brothers. I walk up to this fence and I look over and I see this drummer playing, and he says, "Who the hell is that on my fence? Get your ass off of it." I'm like, "Oh!" He scared me, right? And he says, "Just kidding." Said, "Come on in." And it was Tootie. And he was actually rehearsing with a singer named Nancy Wilson, who's a great jazz singer. So from that point forward, he became instrumental in my life. And he doesn't call me anything but Pistol, Pistol, Pistol. That's it. Pistol's the name. And this is, uh, Teena Marie. And these are some guys that I played with. And oddly enough, in this picture should have been Lenny Kravitz. And I think Lenny was standing to the side. As a matter of fact, he called me. I went down to Santa Monica, listened to the tracks, and I'm like, "Yeah, sounds alright. Yeah, whatever, Lenny." He invited me to the concert. We went and I just watched my career disappear. No, I'm kidding. No, I'm kidding. I mean, it's... It is what it is, you know? All right. I got an idea. I'm going to do this. I'm going this and then... - Just give me a bonk, you know? - Okay. Okay, now here's what we do at the bonk. - All right. - We're going to had conversation where I'm gonna say something, I'm... And then... And then you're going to say something. Then you're going to say a little word there. When these guys get together in the room on the very first day, it starts off under this false premise that five people who don't know each other come together to make a band. And you think, "How can that possibly work?" But it does work very quickly because they're all there for that purpose and they're all focused on creating something. I don't tell these rockers what to do, I... I've learned my lesson, you know, they are smarter than I am when it comes to music. And I might be able to make deals and put them in a room together with people, but when it comes to telling them what to do, I let every rock star do what they want to do best that Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. So if they feel that they want to do a masterclass or if they feel they want to teach them to write a song, they get very involved in these people and they respect them because they're fellow musicians. So yes, the work is hard, but it's good-hard. - Yeah. - These campers come in next. Oh, wow, organic popcorn. - I'm gonna lose my voice. - We're doing And do you know what we spent all morning doing? Oh. What's your band? Men 'O' Pause. Men 'O' Pause. Amazing. I like that. I love hosting events. You should have done Men'O'Pause and the Hot Flashes. I... I tried to throw Hot Flash in there but they said, "No, it's too much." - That was too much? - Too much. They said it's too much. I need to go from? - I missed the whole line. Sorry. - Yeah. I think the singing part is harder. That's about when you're down to singing... Drumming, oh my God, if you missed a beat or if you didn't hit the cymbal, you could do that and get away with it. Now, singing, you got to know those words. People know these songs. They expect the lyrics to be right. You know, it's hard to kind of fake that part. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's not easy doing these camps. I got to figure out, um, we need one more amp. It can be extremely frustrating, and extremely hard work. With these, uh, musicians, they vary in qualities. Some are very good but equally they might apply with something not that good. There were some train wrecks. Some of them were caused by me. We were about to play "Sweet Child of Mine." And Slash made a mistake. We still make mistakes. Yeah, it's like, you know? - In front of 80,000 people. - Yeah. You know, but that's Rock and Roll. You know, Robert Plant and the Who, you know, Peter Townshend, when I was growing up, I looked at those guys thinking, man, they got it together, you know, boy, I wish I had that kind of confidence. They... They weren't confident. Plant'd stand around, you know, doing things, he didn't know what to do with his hands. Daltrey swinging the mic stand and waiting for Pete to make the next move because their jamming, he don't know what to do. Folks, we don't have it together any better than you. We just learnt how to get out and do it. You're bringing that audience home with you. You're taking them on a ride. That's a lot of responsibility One, two, three, four. Right? I mean, you can't explain it unless you do it because it's just one of those things, it's like being a mom. I mean, it's kind of the same thing at... in... In Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. It's... It's really difficult to explain unless you've actually done it and gone through it and see how life changing it is. - It's okay. - Oh, my God. It's a lot of salad. You making that much salad? Wife, mom, boss. That's sort of my mantra. As much as I love my job, I don't think it defines me. I love playing jobs. It doesn't define me. It's just another facet of me. I love my family, doesn't define me. Anyway, you don't want... Do you want wine, baby? No, right? All right. You're not giving her any wine. No, she gets the... There water for her. Give her some water. Everybody! Please welcome Kiss! We have the Kiss, you know, the Kiss Condoms. When you're cold, you got to have the Kiss Cozy. This piece is a paper mache Gene Simmons that my daughter made when she was really little. It wouldn't be Kiss without the Kiss Gene Simmons, hooking up panties. Kiss was great about making media events, about everything we did. Did you know that some of our stores are actually open all night? I mean, I've been following them since I was a kid. Yeah! If anybody told me I could totally live the rock star life, uh, I would have to really, really carefully consider that. There is a price to pay. If that meant, no, I didn't spend any time with my family and my husband was miserable at home alone, and my doggie missed me, yeah, nuh-uh. - Hey, buddy, there you go. - Really get the bottom. - Nice. - Oh, my God. It's so bad. I can't eat that. It's not even edible. You believe that crap? Don't do drugs. So I'm being selfish, this camp. As much as I love drumming, I wanted to be on stage with Paul Stanley dancing. - Welcome back. - Hey. How are you? Good. How are you? Nice to see you. The drummer gets the, you know, the little punch of the high five. They come over, they do the little shake and then they walk off the side, and then that's it, that's the love you get. So could we sign on memorabilia first? So I'm gonna suck it up, I'm gonna attack the fear, and I'm going to do this with Paul Stanley, and I'm going to sing. That's what I want. This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to do this. And I'm hoping I can pull it off. So this is really scary. Yeah. Right now, you can go, you're ready. Have a little surprise for you. What are you doing here? Did you pay to come to camp this week? I was going to say to you how do you get in the business. You open the door. If we were just wearing jeans and... and Pumas, we could play into our eighties. But when you're carrying around 30 or 40 pounds of gear, and you're running around and you want to make sure that your stomach is not hanging over your tights. You think we could possibly see any of your past members get up to jam with you guys for a song on stage? - Anything's possible. - Yeah. I love to see, like, Bruce Kulick get up and do something with you. - So would he. - Yeah? Music is magical. I think all the arts are magical. Just got to chill because music is indelibly a part of who I am. But when you're younger and you don't have kids and you don't have family, your band or your music, or whatever you pursue is your life. The beauty about having children hopefully with the... the right spirit, quite honestly, it's... It's part of why we're here on... on Earth, I think, is to produce children who are better than us, go further than us, and make the world better than we do. Thank you. - 250. - 250 or 200? - 200, 250. - Oh, yeah. Blake, he's a pretty important part of my life. I connected with him pretty early on. I've been teaching him for about four years. Like they say, like, a kid in a candy store. - But there are kids, I guess. - Yeah, well... The question isn't what Blake can do. The question is what Blake can't do and there's not much. He can play anything I throw at him. And if his technique isn't up to par, he will work on it 'til he absolutely nails it. One, two, ready, go. Blake struggles with saying what's on his mind. But he'll play and he'll play. And play and play. And you can kind of tell what mood he's in by how he plays. - Good job, buddy. - Thank you. It's about catching that spark. Ideas come usually at the most inconvenient times. Driving along in the car, I had to pull over and get my book out and write something down, or I have to cut the shower short, or I'm in the middle of going to the bathroom, it's like, "No, no." Here it is, right here. My notes. There might be the next "Ain't Got No Satisfaction" in there. Probably not but you never know. It's more like a cow, though. There's a song by The Temptations called "Papa Was A Rolling Stone." It's a six and a half minute song. - Whoa. - Yeah. To be a bass player, you have to get your ego out of the way. That's it. I almost lost my first professional gig because of overplaying. The band-leader said if you don't pull it back and simplify, I may have to let you go. You know, imagine if Gollum played the bass. Play more notes, it's boring. Now, now, the master's the song. It's boring. That first gig that I almost lost led on to the next gig, which led to me playing with Jimmy Page with The Firm. Rock broccoli. Yeah. Got some peas. You know, there's no place like gnome. I really was living the rock and roll fantasy, and I was living the reckless rock and roll lifestyle that goes with that. This is nice. This is gonna be good in juice. Oh, yeah. - This one is lemony isn't it? - Ooh! You feel kind of invincible, like you're on top of the world. That's when things started to change. It's so nice, it made my eyes water. Oh, yes, it made my throat burn. In a good way, of course. - It's quiet now. - It's quiet now, yeah. Ooh! Now? George and I... Wow, well, it goes back a long way. That's a whole story unto itself. I, uh, in my crazy days in the eighties. With The Firm, we had our own plane with, uh, Jimmy Page in there. Plenty of sold out shows and travelling the world and endless parties and all that. The stuff that you dream of you think is going to fulfill you and make you happy. It just doesn't. I was drinking like, almost a bottle of whisky a day. This... There were people that had known me during that time, and they saw a friend of mine like a year or so later and they go, "Oh, yeah. I was hanging with Tony Franklin. He said, "Oh, that guy. Is he still alive?" - Oh, wow. - He seriously thought that I would not make it. - Well, I'm really glad you did. - Me too, love. Rock camp is a little bit like self-realization because you are finding yourself. To be able to give the campers a magical experience that they'll never forget and draw my experience, just to be able to do that is... It's a pretty deep thing, it really is, it's beautiful. - It's magical. - Hey! How I reconnected with my joy of playing... - How are you doing? - All right. ...was here at Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. Oh! This isn't a chore. You know, I'm at a point in my life where I don't have to do anything I don't want to do. It's not about money, it's not about, um, perks. It's about, I enjoy it. What struck me the most in a way was how appreciative and excited and inspired these people are. It's just a really cool experience to touch someone's life, inspire them with music that they grew up with. That's what it's about, I realize now. These people don't have to do Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. Uh, it's been really great to see the way... the way Alice Cooper and the way Roger Daltrey and Gene Simmons see how these rock stars have been touched by it and wanted to be part, um, is really... is really been a beautiful thing. ♪ I can see right through Your plastic, man ♪ ♪ I look all white, But my dad was black ♪ ♪ My fine looking suit Is really made out of sack ♪ Now you guys should go to these masterclasses. Oh, yeah. I'm going to the vocals one. - Okay. - With Jason. And you should go to a guitar one. Or... Or... Or you can go and drink, whatever you choose. Well, the two are not mutually exclusive. - Right? - Yes, right. Just right right now. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ Did it feel smooth? Do you push from your diaphragm? Did you feel the difference? - Yes. - Yeah. Just hold on. Hey, babe. I'm in the middle of a vocal thing. Ready? I'll call you back, okay? Thanks. I've really suffered a lot with anxiety and panic attacks over the years. I really had to find my own way to fix it myself. And for me, it was music. These people that do come to the camp, a lot of them have problems they want to overcome. And within those five days, eventually, they show their true colours and their true angers. I came from Cuba, as a six year old kid. My mother and father gave me a guitar and said, "Learn how to play this, it'll help you make friends wherever you are." Grew up pretty strict Orthodox Jewish family. Definitely the black sheep of the family. If they saw me like this right now, they probably get a little scared and, uh, and a bit worried. All right, ladies. Here comes another one. I've always just had stage fright, you know? I never, ever thought I was good enough. But now more than anything, I just feel anxious but ready to rock. I'm not a very good guitar player. You know, Oh, my God, Jeff Beck, I can't possibly get up on stage and play alongside him. All of a sudden, the drums just kick in and just take the band to a whole another level. And I turn around and it's the drummer from Chicago. That's the first time in my life that I had ever played with a professional drummer of that caliber. Playing guitar as something like as Jeff Beck. Yeah, I mean, he's coming out full of enthusiasm for it. You know, this thing is offering every musician that does it, something. When you walk on stage, you own it. And no one at that moment and in that time, is better than you are. Whatever it is, don't be afraid to like, do you, you know, loosen up a little bit. This is about having fun. If I was in charge, I would get Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp in every school, sixth grade. And I used to teach sixth grade. Rock and Roll Fantasy! Yeah! That's what keeps me going. Every day I open up my emails and people just tell me we changed our lives at this camp. It was awesome jamming with the guy that wrote one of rock's biggest anthems ever. Just wow. It's a great feeling when people think you're important and you make them feel like they're the stars and they are. I see you playing, you like your part, but get with him. As long as you got him back there. - We can't lose. - We can't lose. Yeah, it's great. - Paul's right. - A pocket. Yeah, a pocket. Good job, guys. Guy's awesome, man. For him to point to me to say, "With that guy back there on drums, you can't go wrong." And he said he reminds me of Buddy Miles. I grew up listening to Buddy Miles. To be acknowledged by someone of the caliber of Paul Stanley of Kiss, what he has achieved is what my ultimate goal is, and that's something I will cherish for the rest of my life. I really will. To be recognized by my peers, if you will, in a genre that I'm not used to, was uplifting was encouraging. Um, so I will now be a metal head. All right? Okay? Depending on your age group and your taste in music, there are certain musical movements and personalities who are very defining. And Dave Mustaine is a musician who many would say is the guy who created thrash metal through the way he played guitar. ♪ Then do it! ♪ When I was in my bedroom, jamming these songs when I was in a high school band, if you would have told that Scott that someday Dave Mustaine is gonna be watching you play his song, that Scott would have just never believed you and said, like, whatever, you know, pipe dream. We went out of town, and all those sort of things, it was like the Megadeth soundtrack, the Metallica soundtrack. Thank you. I used to give him potato with... Context for a Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp in my life has been that I have a special needs son. My second child, he was born with brain damage. Couldn't see, couldn't hear, no voluntary movement. - Yeah. - This was the end of me being a musician, actually. Good job. And what do you do with your feet? In fact, I was recording a CD and I was planning on releasing it and I was planning on even touring behind it, then Jackson came along. Hello, little Jackson. Hello, sleepyhead. And became the only thing that matters. How do we help Jackson? The first thing is he has profound, diffuse, bi-lateral brain damage. How do you help this child be the fullest human being they can be? And so all attention went to Jackson. Boy, not happening. We had a very intensive home program. Helping rewire his brain. It was like boot camp at our house. Hey, look at you, look at you. Well done. Well done. Whoo! Give it up. Give it up. Good job. What's this? O. Good job, Jack. Go, go, go. Perfect. One day, you know, his hands and his ears and actually his eyes would move as if it was a reaction. I remember us going, "Did that really just happen?" Watch this! It's really just hard-gained, miracle type stuff. You can beat me on this one. It's a battle. You're doing it. One more. You're gonna tie it up. Get it. - I beat you. - Yeah, you totally nailed it. Nicely done. Give me some. All right. Good job. So tell me more about the day. - Yeah. - What's your film about? - Me being a monster. - About you being a monster? No way. And what do you do when you're a monster? - I take kids down. - Down where? Down to Chinatown. You take kids down to Chinatown. That's awesome. Yeah. You drop first and then I drop after. One, two, three. Oh, no. You got to get it right in the lines, okay? One. Stay in the black lines. Good one. That's a good one. Slow down. Excellent. Good job. Nice work. So, Jackson, what would you like to do this year? What's one of your goals for this year? Play bass at Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. Yeah? Yeah. That's a G, so that's the... that right, but we can do open first. All right, third fret. - Good, Jack. - It's a lot. Where did you go? Go on, boy, quarterback. So is there any chicken in your chicken soup? - No. - No? Awesome. I did it. Yes, you did. You cooked. Yeah, nicely done. All right. - Rock and Roll. - Nice. So, uh, you guys want... Want to try something? - Yeah, absolutely. - Okay. Um, how about in the chorus, sit out and one beat. One, two, three. - Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. - Cool. So whose guitar can I borrow real quick? So that's the riff and then the other main riff and the cho... There's a slight little bend going up. - Good job, guys. That was fun. - Thank you. Yeah. This is yours too. The siren warble. What's Teddy like as a councillor? - Teddy has a... - Does he stay on point - or was he all over the place? - Well, sort of all over the map. Sort of, but... By the time you had a whole day of work and a visiting legend and then a jam session at the end, 10, 12 hours can actually start to unhinge you. So we have to go to the Martini Bar to do some repairing. As long as you guys had fun, you guys sounded fricking fantastic. You guys did. You know the fact that David lets me do the Q&A's here, - Oh, that's awesome. I know. - That's huge for me. If it weren't for Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp, I can't say that I would even have any interest in broadcasting it. - That's one cowboy ninja. - Bear Cowboy Ninja. Bear Cowboy Ninja. Oh, okay. I got it. She's improved a lot. - Yeah, I guess. - I'm telling you. You're going to have a big sadness, Monday morning. Oh, yeah, you're gonna be like in depression, bro. - You're like... - The low after the high. Post-camp depression is a thing. - It's... it's heartbreaking. - Right? So tonight will be "Patience." - Bad Moon. - A little "Bad Moon Rising." All right? Okay, here we go. So that's... that's our set right there. Gentlemen, play it right. Play it with no mistakes and play it well and, um, you all... There'll be a drink waiting for you at the bar. - How about have fun? - Oh, there you go. - And have fun. There you go. - Have fun. A little hard for my little band. Yeah! Alrighty. - So. - Okay, so last day, guys. - Last day. - Last day, last night. How about rock and roll all night? - Tammy. - Oh, yeah. We can do it. Just do "Startled." - Are you in a bad mood? - I am in a bad mood. Just... Just do "Startled." That's a good song. - Ooh. - Oh, my alarm. What the hell is that? - Tinker Bell? - It's Christmas. It's Christmas. Yes. So wait. Okay, let's get ready to check in, in Southwest. - Hello. - A very important thing. Here you are, B33. Got a better one than me and that one's on time. What am I? - B? - B33. I like to be A. We got four minutes. Check this out. Okay, okay. I know, I gotta put my plugs in. No, no, we'll play though. ♪ I know She's gonna make you cry ♪ Tammy, she's an amazing singer. She gave me chills a couple times. Last night we played, she hits a note that was ridiculous. I fell off the drums set. - Are you sure? - Because I... I put seat-belt on. What do you like better? Being behind the kit or being up front? I'm going to be honest. It's more nerve wracking being in front. - Being up in front? - Oh, my God. - More nerve-wracking. - You could hide behind drums. And even if you mess up, you can cover it a bit. You can go on with dirty pants. You know, this shirt's wrinkled. There's spilled something down here. - Sneakers. - It doesn't matter. I have to thank you very much for giving me confidence to do this, because this was very, very hard for me. No, seriously. - This was very hard for me. - It's like the love connection. I know, right? - Hey. - See you there, man. - See you soon. - All right. I'm off. You guys sounded great. - You guys sounded great. - This was fantastic. I mean, it really was. It's very hard for people to be up on stage in the first place. You know, who wants to be told, "Yo, that stinks." Rock and roll. But once you break through it, you realize the only thing you have to fear is fear itself. Thank you, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Well, maybe fire... Playing in your bedroom is not the same as playing with a drummer and playing with a bass player and... If one part is wrong, it makes the other part wrong. ...Fantasy, guys, final night here in Las Vegas, Nevada. Being in tune is important. I was drinking so much water in my room, man. I'm going to piss my pants. Not playing ahead of the beat. How are you feeling, brother? I felt better. Not being too loud. But the show must go on. Hey, you know, I got that throat spray if you want the last of it. I'll try anything right now. And listening. Blow it out. So who cares after we're done and it's fine. This is the one thing that some people forget is one of the most important parts about playing music. Hi! My dad lived a... a tough life growing up, He lost all his sisters except one in the war. But there was the music, whether it was cantorial music, whether it was the opera, it was the power of music that kept my dad alive. Surviving Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. You're just getting appetizers now? - Just for now. Just for now. - Yeah, just to have something. Something on the table, and there's gonna be other people. So I don't vomit. If they're playing three songs and it's 12, 15 minutes. That goes by in a heartbeat. I think we're almost the same size. We can swap shoes. And if that's going to be 12 minutes of blind terror, then I've gone and I haven't done my job and it's a bit of a waste. You need to savour every single second of this. I know. I know. Rub, let some of that rub off of me. - It's rubbing, there you go. - So that I'm not... not... Not so scared all the time. Well, you know what it is? You're concentrating on so many other things up there. - Yeah. - And what do you forget? Like the most important thing, breathing.

It's like, "I got it, mate." I've got the best job in the world. All the belly. The belly. Oh! Wow. Handwork. There you... Oh, there you go. I've had situations where people are so excited about the camp, and when they're done, they'll write to me, go, "Listen. I'm thinking about quitting my job and... and go and do music full time." And that's when you have to... You have to rein them in a little bit. You go, well, don't... just not just yet. You know, but it happens. First one to get there and the last to leave. I hate that. Next life, I'm playing flute. ♪ Get that old man! ♪ Nobody is born a rock star. Nobody is born president or anything. They started off as kids also. And the magic of the camp is you actually meet somebody who scaled Mount Olympus and you have the sense maybe I can do it too. Have you been practising? - Yeah. - ♪ Rock 'n' roll ♪ Beethoven would always say, you know, it's not about playing the right notes, it's if... if you have passion. ♪ Rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock 'n' roll ♪ Here we go! - Louder! - ♪ Rock 'n' roll ♪ If Bob Dylan and Gene Simmons and Jimi Hendrix audition for The Voice, do you think we'd make it? Well, it's about time. This is about... You think we'd make it? I always think that the people that show up at the Fantasy Camp are people that have it in the back of their mind. -You know, -All right. This could develop into something, that something could happen if I got really good. ♪ Whoa! ♪ I... I can't think of a more fun thing to do.
