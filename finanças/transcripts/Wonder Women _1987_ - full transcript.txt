Hold me tight, please! I nearly moved in with him! You must have slept with him, right? I've been with him since I made it into the semi—final. I'll get scolded if I go home too late in the midnight. So it's all right if you don't go home at all? How weird?! I'm tired, can I let you off? We are no more than acquaintances. If I'm not so desperate. I won't take up so much of your time.

I even got a purse to match, want it? What kind of job interviews were they? Cashier...! Cosmetics counter... A gossip magazine claims that a few contestants. Have worked in the China City Night Club. How do you know? I bet you're one of them. You work in an office during the day. At night, you work in the night clubs. With this dress of yours. I will look like one of those clubs girls doubtlessly. I just can't help saying this! When they announced the first runner-up. The TV audience must have smashed their TV sets. Really, she's more like a drag queen then no. 19. She looks like my aunt. She looks like my aunt. My ma says when Hong Kong was war. Everywhere there's Japanese raping the girls. My aunt was caught! But then she was released! They didn't want her! They released her? Yeah? Really? Yes! What a shame? It's true. Wow, you're too ugly! We don't want you, go away!

The winner is No. 31. Fu Kuk Ching. I'll appear in my best shape in front of the reporters. Yammie Leung, you're the best! (Monday) Excuse me! Please hold on a minute! Does she look prettier on TV? She‘s much prettier in person! No pork chop spaghetti, just beef and tomato! You‘ll surely be very busy today! What's that supposed to mean? I heard everybody is coming down to take a look at you! You and your big mouth. When you went for the interview two months ago. The entire building knew already. I didn't spread the news. Maggie, don't forget to bring the magazine along! Brigitta, you look great last night! The winner looked so unnatural! She must have done a face—lift job, am I right? I don't know, I didn't ask! Just look at Miss Youth, she's far from her puberty. Even my twelve—year—old daughter is taller than her! She‘s not even 5 feet tall! No. 22 has no figure at all. No. 22 has no figure at all. How ridiculous. I wish I had entered the beauty contest too.

We're not allowed to put on eye shadow. The winner had a specialist — always at her service. — Great before it's too late! The magazine offers her fifty thousand to pose in it. What do you think? Fifty thousand? All nude? If so, she should demand for a higher price, right? You‘d better be selective with these things! One day when you want to marry some rich guy. — You'll regret it! — Please wait! There's a celebration banquet for a movie tonight. Hello! Okay Yes! Sure! What? Sylvestor Stallone's coming too? Hey, you can't take pictures here! Where are you from? Have you contacted your hair stylist friend? I got work to do now! Can we talk after work? Say a word or two, please!

You can deny, don't let him get away with it! Brigitta, Mrs. Lo wants to see you! What am I supposed to do with you? Your performance is poor! You can't get along with your colleagues. Tell me, just where should I place you? If you're smart I could promote you to sit in the comer! I'm the one who employed you! The boss is giving me a hard time just now. I'm so embarrassed! Don't give me that long face! I don't feel good either! I'll resign! It'll be easier for you! Wait till find someone to replace you first! The people I train are all professionals! You can't just leave as you please! Mary, is the telex here yet? Go and see if it's her? If you've won, I could still say some good words for you. Now you're become a display of the company.

What if he's there? You just leave the key and split! What difference does it make whether he's there or not? If he's there, I'll give him a lesson for you! Please don't! ls Hon-deI—Iy here? I got something for him! — ANDRE! — Hello! Just take a seat. You are free today? Hunnh! Shit, your hair's been damaged! - Really? - Yeah! Everybody says so. European stylists don't know Chinese girl's hair. This style doesn't suit you! I looked terrible for the past few weeks. It's true. These weeks are the time when I look like a mess. Is that so? The stylist is appointed by the organizer! Yung, didn't you say you wanted Miss Leung's autograph? He's too shy! They said your score is pretty high. You nearly turned out to the second runner-up. Really? How did you know? They talked about it at the party last night! Now you're in a much better position. You don't have to go through the reigning period. You can concentrate on the screen. You‘re gonna be good! Have some tea, Miss Leung! Can I have your autograph? How should I address you? I'm Yung! I forgot how to spell "Yung". I'll just scribble it! This person has something for you.

Where are you taking my dress? I'm taking it to the laundry. It needs a wash. Why you treat me like I'm living here? I dislike people who pretend to be arrogant. Be honest!
