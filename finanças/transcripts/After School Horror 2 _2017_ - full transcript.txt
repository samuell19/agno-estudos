I won't let you join Tyas' cheerleader team. Tirta, if you really love me, you should have shown your support. Tyas' team has great achievements. They are the best in our school and they always win. I know that. But the thing is, you have to paint Sumarni in our school storeroom. We know that's taboo. Painting Sumarni's face is like asking for your death. I won't let you risk your life just for her stupid request. This is the only way I can join Tyas. I have to do that. I know she means bad to you. Because I know she never likes you. Because she's jealous. Jealous of who? Jealous of you? The point is, I don't want you to do that ritual tonight. Okay? But this is my only chance. - I'm sorry, Tirta. - Rin! What are you doing at school at this hour? No more extracurricular activity. We just have a small business. We won't take long. Please? No! This is almost midnight. - Go home! - But, sir... We won't be long inside. Please? Just a couple of minutes. We promise. - Okay, don' take too long. - Thank you! Come on. Hold this. Let's go. This is her picture. You understand the rules, right, Ririn? This is the print out of Sumarni's photo. As in our agreement, you have to paint her face. And if you succeed... ...you will be accepted in Karisma High School cheerleader team. - Hold this first. - Tyas. You can call me or Debby when you're done. - Now go inside. Come on! - But... You said you want to be in the team! Go inside! Tyas! Don't leave me here! Tyas! Debby! Don't leave me here! Let's leave her. Hold on. She's calling me. Tyas, please open the door. I have done the painting. Open it yourself! 5 Years Later You haven't touch your porridge, Tyas. Aunt Inah, did you knock my door earlier? No, I never knocked your room. Is something wrong? Never mind. Maybe I misheard something. Tyas, why haven't you eat your breakfast yet? Eat it, okay? Let me feed you. Aunt Ina. Can you help feed her later in the afternoon? - Don't forget her medication. - I get it. I feel bad for her. It's been years since she's like this. I am perplexed. - Rangga. - Hey, Putra. I am ready. Ready for what? - What is that? - This? This is a rose for Eva. I want to confess to her. - Are you sure? - A hundred percent. I want to prove that I really like her. But I think... And with this rose, I will say this to her. "Eva, I always like you. Would you accept me as your boyfriend?" I know, Putra. But I think... - That's gross. - Oh, so both of you like men. Wait, no. It's not like what you think! Get up! - You're so cheesy! - I don't care. - See you, I'll confess to her now. - Putra, wait! Sandra, you have to come with me. What is it, Rangga? - Just come with me first. - Yeah, but tell me what is it. - Putra wants to confess to Eva. - What? Is he crazy? Where is he? I was trying to stop him. But I can't help myself. He looks so excited. And he brings a flower with him. Fine. Let's go. Eva. Can I talk to you? Putra, the school starts in five minutes. So you have 2 minutes to talk to me. One minute for my comments. And 2 minutes for me to walk back to my class. Okay. Everyone, listen up! I have to confess something to Eva. And you're all a witness. Eva. I like you. Would you accept me as your boyfriend? - Seriously? - I mean it. I will make you happy. I promise. - Putra. - Yeah? You said you will make me happy, right? Then I have a challenge for you tonight. Sure. Just say it. If you ask me, I will do anything for you. The challenge is, you have to paint Sumarni's face in the locked storeroom. If you can do that... ...you can be my boyfriend. Okay. Putra. Sandra. Rangga? - Just forget about her. - Why? She never meant anything she said. Just let it go, man. I know you always wanted a cute girlfriend like Eva. But there are cuter girls out there. Right, Sandra? There's Sally, Olive, Clara, and many others. I'm sure there will be some cute girl who is also interested in you. But Eva is not one of them. No, but she said she will accept me... ...if I paint Sumarni's face at the storeroom at the back. That doesn't make any sense. What are you talking about? Unless you want your life to be taken or become mentally ill like... Like my sister. What is wrong with you two? - Come on, forget her. - Putra! What if he really do your challenge? No way. He won't do it. Even if it took him hundred years to do that, he won't make it. Besides, he doesn't even have the guts. Eva. I accept your challenge. See? I think you need a quick plan B. Fine. Let's see what happens tonight. Okay, I'm not afraid! This house looks so creepy. Gosh. Who are you? You scared me. I'm Putra. I called you earlier. - You're Widodo's brother, aren't you? - I am. - How is he now? - He is fine. It's been a while since I talked to him. I heard he's studying in Amsterdam. Yeah, he's studying machine engineering there. - That's a great choice. - Right. Actually I come here to talk to you. - About what? - About... I want to paint Sumarni's face. - Are you serious? - Yes. For what purpose? The girl I like dared me to do that. I wouldn't suggest that if you care about your life. My brother told me you know a way to hold back her spirit... ...when someone try to paint her. After your girl passed away... ...I heard you've been researching a lot about this. And you know how to do it, right? - But it doesn't always work. - But I'm begging you. Listen. I can't help you. - The consequences is very dangerous. - I will face the risk no matter what. Because I really love this girl. Please. I don't care about the risk. I promise. - Fine, let's go inside. - Okay. Bring these dolls with you if you want to paint Sumarni. With these, her spirit won't notice you there. She will be focused at these dolls. - I just have to bring these dolls? - Yeah, just these. But remember. This is at your own risk. If something ever happened to you, never come back here again. Okay, I won't. Wish me luck, okay? I'm not your mom. Just go, bring the dolls with you. Sandra? - Rangga. - We need to go to our school tonight. This late? Why? Putra texted me. He said he will do that challenge. So he's on his way to school. We have to help her, please. Does he use his brain? All of this just for Eva? - That's what I thought. - Okay, let me get changed first. Alright. Don't take too long! Why is it taking him so long to set up the CCTV? Shut up. Actually I'm afraid. That's why I can't stop talking to suppress my fear. And we are... ...in the storeroom. The place for your challenge. This is all your idea. Why are you afraid? That's why I regret giving you this idea. Eva. The ritual hasn't start, right? But why the ghost shows up already? Maybe the ghost doesn't have a patience. My ears hurt! Why are you two screaming? Vivi? You really scared us, you know? When should I begin my part to scare him? It's almost midnight. I'm sleepy. Just wait. Putra still hasn't come. Just go back to your post. Hide yourself. Hurry up! You're so slow. Why didn't you tell me you're using a fake ghost? I'm a scaredy cat. Well, it just came to my mind. Then suddenly, I got an idea this afternoon... ...to use a fake ghost to make this challenge more fun. Well, you're right. Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. It's all right. I've set up the CCTV. You can see on the monitor. Okay, let me see. Listen up. Especially you, Putra. So, you will enter from this door. You go inside, and this is where you will do your challenge. - You get that? - Of course. Right. This is your material. Okay, thanks. - Take him to his spot. - Hurry up. You will be on your own from here. - Are you serious? - Of course I am. Quick, get inside. - Look, he's freaking out. - His face is so funny. Let's head straight to the storeroom. Putra! Putra! Putra! Putra! Help! Why are there two girls in there? Did you bring another girl besides Vivi? - Help! - Putra! Help me! Eva. Sorry, I haven't scared him yet. I just got back from the bathroom. Something's wrong with my stomach. - Help! - Putra! - Help me, please! - Putra! Putra, it's me and Rangga! It's locked. - Putra! - Move it! Putra! - Putra, hang in there! - Putra! Putra! Find something, quick! Putra! Let's get out of here! - Hang in there! - Sandra, move it. Putra! Hurry! Putra! - Putra, wake up! - Wake up, man! Rangga... I suddenly have the chills. I feel that, too. Wake up, Putra! - Ouch... - Come on! - Where are they? - What? Let's just go! What's wrong with you? - Putra! - Wait, Putra! Putra! Putra! - Putra! - Rangga, help! - Sandra! - Help me! - Sandra! - Help me! Let's go! Hurry! What is that? Ghost! I saw her face, Rangga. I'm scared! I know, I know. Listen. Just forget about that, okay? I can't do that. An owl? I heard Sumarni owned pet owls. And she's sharing her stories with them. Wait, how did you know about this? From Tyas. She told me. She is an alumni here... - Okay, so what should we do now? - I don't know! Who is that? Where are you? Fine, I'm coming. Stay right where you are. - Let's head to the cafeteria. - Okay. Let's go. Putra? Putra? What was that? Rangga... What are you doing here? Let's get out! You're scaring me. Putra. Just forget about this. No more of this, okay? Forget about Eva. You see what she did to you? You almost lost your life! - What were you thinking? - Say something! Rangga! Sorry, I can't make it to the cafeteria. I was hiding in the nurse room. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - What are you doing with these dolls? - These? A friend of mine gave it to me. He said if I bring these dolls, Sumarni's spirit will leave me alone. - That's nonsense. Let's get back home. - Hey... Fine, I'll to get my motorbike first. My motorbike's dead. Sandra, what's done is done. Forget about tonight. You just rest, okay? I will head home with Putra. Okay. Take care, you two. - You, too, Putra. - Okay. Thank you, Sandra. - Let's go. - Wait. - What? - What about my bike? - There's a garage nearby. - You sure? Yeah, just follow me. Where have you been? I've been up all night waiting for you. I went to... ...to my friend's home. I was studying math. Next time you need to get back home this late, call me. So I can feel safe knowing where you are. I feel bad for your sister. She can't sleep waiting for you. Tyas. I'm sorry. - Can you bring her to her room, please? - Sure. Let's go, Tyas. You're all going to die! Ouch. What you told me yesterday didn't work. Her spirit attacked me. I almost died after the ghost choked me. And there was two of them. Then I don't have anything else. I told you the risk is high. Now you have to deal with it. Now I want you to leave my house and never come back here. Got it? - Wait. - What is it? Where are my dolls? Don't tell me you lost them. - I'm sorry, they're gone. - What were you doing? I don't care what you have to do, I want them back! Eva? Are you okay? I'm fine. Why are you asking that? You look scared. Actually, I do. Sumarni's spirit is chasing me. I feel really stressed. You want to know something? I'm still not really sure... ...but I think Sumarni's spirit possessed the doll. And the doll is now alive... ...and have been terrorizing me. Maybe you're just seeing things. Why don't you come shopping with me to some boutiques? Alright. Let me get changed first. Putra. Eva? I thought you're still... Can I have a drink? I'm thirsty. A drink? Yeah, of course. The doll... Good day, ma'am. Look at these cute dolls. Good afternoon, we have good selection of dolls here. - Which one do you want? - I want that one. It's cute. This one? - Mom, isn't it cute? - It is cute. - You like that one? - I like it. What's the matter? - The doll is scary. - Why? It's alive. - What happened? - I'm scared. I want to go home. - Sorry, miss. - Yes, it's alright. Sandra, what's wrong? Did Sumarni's spirit ever bother you? No, everything is peaceful. Nothing is bothering me. Her spirit came to me last night. - Wait a second. - Yeah. - Putra? - Hi, Sandra. Come in, and close the door. - Hey, Putra. Why the long face? - Hey, Rangga. I feel troubled. Ever since what happened in the storeroom last night... ...I couldn't sleep. Sumarni and her friend's spirits are still haunting me. And one time, her spirit even took form of Eva. Same thing happened to me, too. And the craziest part, that spirit entered the dolls... ...and now they're alive and terrorizing me. Are you serious? - But you're okay, right? - I'm okay now. Thankfully, I threw away those dolls. And I hope... ...they won't bother me again because I threw them away. But we still have to be cautious. Until we're really sure that they won't haunt us anymore. Yeah. Hello, Iman? It's okay if you can't pick me up. Okay. I need to go to the bathroom. Call you back? Okay. You want me to feed you? Who is it? Who is it? Ririn? Ririn? Ririn? Where are you? Hey! Going to the cafeteria? Putra... - I thought you threw them away. - I did. But I have no idea why they are here. I found them lying there. - Are you sure? - Of course, I am. I clearly threw them away. I don't what to do anymore. We have to burn these dolls. I'm sure if the ghost is inside it, they will burned as well. - I agree with that. - Okay, let's do it. Rangga, Sandra. I can't help but think about Eva. Do you think she's been haunted, too? Can you already stop thinking about her? It's not important. Don't you learn something from this? And remember, we're now followed by ghosts because of that girl. Burn them down. Those are Sumarni and her friend's spirits! We failed! Sandra! What's wrong with you? Sandra? - Sandra? - Hey, what's wrong? Sandra? Sandra! You won't be able to get rid of me! - Sandra! - Let me go! Let me go! Sandra, calm down! What were you doing? Rangga, I'm sorry. Sandra? Thank God. Move it! - What happened? What? - My face... My face is full of blood! - There's no blood on your face. - There is! I saw it in the mirror while I washed my face! No way. You must be seeing things. And I saw ghosts. - It's Sumarni! - Stop it! I don't want to talk about that storeroom thing any more. I have to take a dump, okay? No, don't go inside yet! Then where should I poop? In your hand? - Then please wash them after that. - You're so gross! - I have to poop! - Whatever! My twin? Maybe she is my dad's daugther from his secret affair? - Putra... - Yeah? What the... These are your dolls. - But we burned them down. - Yeah, this is strange. - How is this possible? - Guys, what should we do now? Okay. Let's throw them away again. I'm afraid something bad will happen if we don't do anything. Okay, let's do it. What the... The dolls disappeared. What should we do? What can I do? You want me to bribe the ghost to stop them from haunting us? Do you think it's possible? Of course you can. They're materialistic ghosts. - Hey, Rangga, Sandra. - Hi, Eva. Because of you, Sumarni's spirit is terrorizing us. Why are you blaming me? Of course it's on you. You asked Putra to do that challenge. Because I've had enough with him. But that's not how you should get rid of him. What is something bad happened to us? You want to take responsibility? Just so you know, it's not just you that have been haunted by them. - They have been haunting me, too. - What? So Sumarni has been haunting you, too? Shut up. What the... Rangga! Sandra! Hey. What happened to you guys? Rangga, Sandra! It's me, Putra! Someone help me! Help me! Putra! What's wrong with you? I saw all of you turned into ghosts. I can't believe it. You're starting to hallucinate. Those spirits will do anything to meet their anger. Yeah, this is like some kind of game until one of us... ...die. But we don't know who's going to be the first or the last one to die. No, I don't care who dies first or last, we must not let that happen. Eva called me. Wait a minute. Hello, Eva? Sure, I'm coming. She asked to meet me behind the school. I'll go first. - See you. - Putra! Let's follow him. Eva? Why you want to meet me here? Eva, what's wrong with you? I'm Sumarni. All of you must die! Eva! - Stop it! - Let me go! Hold her! Don't let her go! Eva! Come to your senses! - What are you doing? - Rangga! - Eva? - Take her! What should we do now? She have been passed out for a while. Yeah, everyone has left the school, but she still hasn't wake up. - I'm scared. - Shut up! Eva, you finally awake. You're in the nurse office. What happened to me? Rangga, Putra and Sandra brought you here because you passed out. They said... ...that you were possessed. Possessed? You must be kidding. You almost killed Putra! - What do you mean? - Well... When you were possessed, you're about to stab him with a knife. But thankfully, Rangga and Sandra came to help. But don't worry about that, I know you weren't yourself. - Let's go home. Help me up. - Be careful. Here's your milk. I put it on the table. - Thanks, Aunt Ina. - Sure. Rangga, please pick it up. Please... Aunt Ina! Aunt Ina! Aunt Ina! Aunt Ina! Aunt Ina! Sis, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Wait here. Where is it? Mr. Jamal... - We have to meet now. It's mportant! - Okay. Where does that sound come from? Please leave me alone. Guys, we can't stay like this. We have to something to stop Sumarni and her friend's spirits. So they'll stop haunting us. I know you're right. - But how? - He's right. How? And I'm suffering the worst here. Because you're causing the trouble in the first place. - You see the consequences yourself. - I know this is my fault. So what should we do now? We have to see someone who knows the story about Sumarni. I think his name is Mr. Jamal. - He used to work in our school. - How do you know about this? I used to hear stories from my sister... ...before she fell ill. She is an alumni in Karisma High School, so... Okay, so you know where this Mr. Jamal live? Yeah, I know. I checked on my sister's phone and thank God, I found his address. - That's great. - Okay. Let's go there. Excuse me? Mr. Jamal? Mr. Jamal? Yes? Who might you be? Why are you here at this hour? I'm Sandra. They're my friends, Rangga and Putra. We're students of Karisma Bangsa High School. We are here because... ...we would like to ask you a couple of questions. I actually never told anyone... ...about how to break the curse from Sumarni. Because your life will be at stake. I'm begging you. Please to tell us. And we will accept whatever the consequences might be. Please, sir. Fine. You have to paint Sumarni's face... ...on 12 papers. And you have to use human blood. Why human blood? Because spirit needs human blood. When you're done... ...you have two offer two dead goats... ...and keep them inside the storeroom for 30 days. - You understand? - We got it. Okay, but, sir... ...I still have one question. Do you know why her spirit lingers in our school? This is a very long story. Sumarni... ...was a very beautiful girl. She was forced to marry a Dutchman. It's because her parents couldn't pay their debt to him. Her life then got worsen, and she never felt happiness. Her husband torture her every day and never found any happiness. Until one day she had enough. And he killed her husband, along with all his family. Sumarni then committed suicide. And her body was buried in the ground where your school is today. Perhaps that is the reason why Sumarni still haunts the school. - Let's go back to the school. - Sandra. Are you sure you want to do this? We have to be confident with this. Fine, let's go to the school now. Sorry, but what are you kids doing in here? We're just visiting Mr. Jamal. - Jamal? - Mr. Jamal who? - The one who lives here. - Right. He passed away a long time ago. His house was burnt down. Wait. That's impossible. - We just talked to him minutes ago. - Yeah, he's right. - You met him? - Yes, we did. See for yourself, there's only rubble left in here. I think you better go home now. Right. We'll go. - Good evening. - Good evening. Wait. Why shouldn't we let Eva, Lulu or Vivi do this ritual? - Are you sure about this? - They won't do it, Rangga. I'm fine. Really. Alright, let's do it. Tyas? Tyas! What are you doing here? Call an ambulance! Hurry! Tyas? You're awake. What were you doing in school? Your hand was cut and you lost a lot of blood. I... I was trying to break Sumarni's curse. So you know how to do it? I'm worried... ...if you found out about it... ...you will do it yourself. And I won't let that happen. I know how stubborn you are. I saw you looking through my phone. Sis, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Wait here. I suspect... ...you were looking for information about Sumarni. That's why I did this. Maybe this is my fate... ...to redeem my past sins. All of my friends... Ririn, Devi... They're all dead because of me. You need to calm down. Why don't we go to the hospital now? Because you'll need a blood transfusion. We don't have to do that. I'm fine. Can I ask you a favor? What is it? Please take care of Sandra. I know how much you love her. I will. Tyas... ...take a look at this. Tour Packages to Dieng You have to receive some medication as soon as possible. You have to go to the hospital. So we can visit this place when you are recovered. Just the two of us, like the old times. Okay, you pack her stuff and I will wait outside. - How is it? - It's all taken care of. - I just called the hospital. - Okay. - Guys. - Yeah? Can you help me bring this? Miss Tyas? What happened? Miss Tyas is not in her bed! - Tyas! - Sandra! Tyas? Sis! Tyas! Hello? What? Tyas is found dead in the school's storeroom? Please take care of Sandra. I know... ...how much you love her. You understand the rules, right, Ririn? This is the print out of Sumarni's photo. As in our agreement, you have to paint her face. And if you succeed... ...you will be accepted in Karisma High School cheerleader team. - Now go inside. Come on! - But... You said you want to be in the team! Go inside! Are you sure leaving her like this? You know the story. The guy that I have a crush on seems to be fond of nerd like Ririn. Sandra... Tirta... Tirta. - Tirta. - Ririn? Ririn? Ririn? Ririn? Where are you?
