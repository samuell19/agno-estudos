from the AIDS process panic I'm on my way out to beg for more funding walk with me I know he could have infected a whole more but you can't take this autocratic attitude on another doctors - right now

get the hell out of here hey Julie what do you think Saigo the red one the blacks better dad why do they call it a monkey suit it makes you feel like one oh that's your mama my stepmother I was on my way out of there early even and then one thing led to another and how we can wait it's just a $250 plate dinner ouch besides rob will be happy to eat our appetizers for sure when you got the sainthood how did I miss that ceremony you're working you think you might be taking out a little too much too soon here I mean new kids demanding new job been back on your feet for less than a year you know honey this isn't anywhere near the pressure in Africa well you don't take care of yourself you won't be able to take care of anybody else I don't want you to have to go through putting me back together again either Hannah I'm not worried about having to put you back together again I'm worried about having you me no I understand it's fine I'm glad you called me first hmm all right hey what comes after sainthood when they brought him in here I was sure he was another mule od'd when we got a bunch of him slid open like pigs for slaughter now usually I don't get people starting my work for me but whoever did him made such a mess looking for the drugs I just naturally looked there first right mr. cocaine was the cause of death oh yeah yeah the blood levels are through the roof stuff must been almost pure listen I know you don't get to look at oldies much but I do and this one looked really strange you prepare our culture miss me mm-hmm where is it set up right here it's cholera we've ever seen vibrios no nasty luck in our thing who's this man oh who knows he's a John Doe found on Canyon Road but you know nobody swallows balloons coconuts are smuggling right yeah from where and when I mean we need to know everyone this man came in contact with you're gonna have to be tracked for the next five days Tanna the body of the coroner says cholera now I'm gonna have him send you samples to be cultured I mean while we need to alert every County emergency room right now mm-hmm okay thanks police brought this man in yeah you think it's more than this one guy I sure as hell hope not I need to know if you find anyone else like this okay stairs are really getting be too much so where were we why did you handle the sandwiches you made he didn't die of cholera he overdosed that's not the point yeah and the point is homicide said this man has never been arrested so I was hoping that you people might know someone in the drug community that was connected with them look as far as I can make out you're telling me that some drug dealers might get cholera because of the coke they cut out of some dumb mule now as far as I'm concerned I would save me a lot of trouble and it would serve them all right have you ever seen cholera detective no ma'am I don't believe I have well you ought to it's real pretty vomiting diarrhea dehydration kidney failure and yep complete circulatory collapse your blood pressure plummets body goes into shock within 24 hours without medical treatment you are dead it preys on the most vulnerable old people children okay all right all right so what are you saying even junkies and dealers have mothers and kids their families could get sick the incubation period for cholera is 1 to 5 days and it's treatable if you get to it in time but if you don't he kills a lot of people really fast the last outbreak in the Nile Valley 20.000 dead yep we're in the United States it doesn't make us immune I can see you don't like me treading on your turf here I don't get it but if you don't assign somebody to help me right now I will have your captain do it mmm she means at Barnes how are you I listened to her or is there some part of I need help that uh you don't comprehend dr. Cole Louisa Ross detective Rojas oh that's right how could I forget the outfit through me or are you undercover today you know I have such little fashion sense I can't tell the difference they're easy the phone blue it's all yours okay so are we doing this or what boys just keep playing with yourselves always hej wait wait wait let me get one thing straight okay I was sticking up for myself in the beginning of someone whose lip thing or anything hi so you want me to check out this mule yes well whoever this dealers on this end or I don't think I'm gonna get much on the street about them tonight hello when all right yeah all right another probable case over at County General can I go so I wanna go what a homicide see what they got we're gonna get a hold you Oh detective thank you yeah okay well she was going into shock when they brought her in I started her on ringers lactate right away she went completely sour I almost lost her nobody told me about a Colorado Lord until afterwards here she's running here good samples I'm terribly conscious I put her on tetracycline right on Oh terrible yeah III be back as soon as I can Catherine look after you target who is it they're poisoning nation no no you're sick it's just that you're sick and you're gonna feel better in a little while you'll feel better I promise yeah get that let me have your hand never hand I just want to take your pulse there we go you're my doctor mm-hmm that's right there you go can you tell me where you live you know where you live oh it's okay it's all right it's all right it's okay you just rest fine rest hmm or - Oh our they found her downtown first we didn't know what was up it's hard to tell with almost people she sounds pretty far gone do you see any indications of drug abuse no cocaine specifically no what does cocaine have to do with cholera I just the first case was a drug smuggler oh cool you got two more Possible's at st. Mary's one of them is dead okay I'll be there if you need me there's someone on their way down here from my office to do the follow-up will you fill them in yeah absolutely this could get really bad huh like how bad well that gets out of control the problem with cholera is that without treatment it just kills so fast we really got a move on this science and boys okay are you alright I'm fine you call this tossed dr. Raymond mich ER hi well it's just as bad here and as soon as I can I'm on my way right bye hey Doc I'm thinking that maybe maybe this homeless woman picked it up from some coke dealer that's not likely is it well if she was sleeping in some crack house but it doesn't work like that it's not like TV this is an intestinal disease it's usually spread by contaminated water soiled hands or the food that was infected by them right okay so let's let's think about this drug you we don't know where he got it how could it happen Mexico well there's not been much cholera in Mexico lately but it's possible why because he'd been traveling back and forth for the last couple of years you know bringing in Mexican furniture to saw the stores here only this time he wasn't bringing in any furniture but why in his stomach I thought that guy in homicide said that it's usually smugglers on airplanes do that yeah but they still walk in and drive it across that way his ex-girlfriend told me that the Fed adela take his car apart looking for drugs the last time he crossed so I guess this time balloons well you know our worst problem is that he may not have been the only one coming across that border that was exposed to the cholera hundreds of people go across that border yeah it's a nightmare detective call me Lou Lou my staff and I are our fielding these cases trying to nail down this source what I really need from you is to come at it from the other direction I'll find the coke and the dealer's okay I gotta go dr. Cole so you're saying that uh anybody who even tastes the coke that was cut out of that meal they they could get cholera it's possible huh that stuff hits the street we're talking a lot of sick people yep Oh ray Bry looks like a great day for a trip jeez dad what you need any more pockets oh you think I got too many oh why don't you ask Anna can't you get anything right you were such a wussy little girl hej Julie honey how about the backpack remember the one I got you when you had your tooth pulled I mean it's light it keeps your hands-free it's ugly yeah it is ugly it's for you I'm sorry I tried I know I'll get dr.
