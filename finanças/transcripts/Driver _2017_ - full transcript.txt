A few rules before we begin. ﻿One, you came here on your own. ﻿Once they find out you have a driver ﻿it's all over. You won't see a penny. ﻿Two, never stand at the doorway. Go inside and sit down. ﻿Don't show your references until he asks to see them. ﻿I keep the money and at night we split it 50-50. ﻿Got it? ﻿Yeah, I got it. ﻿Good. ﻿Let's do a little exercise. ﻿Tell me your story as if I'm a rich man. ﻿Okay, I'm a student, ﻿a married seminary student. ﻿Big family, thank God. ﻿Seven kids. ﻿Thank God, we're marrying off our daughter ﻿and we have obligations. ﻿Too many obligations. ﻿I don't know how I'll come up with the money. ﻿So I was thinking, ﻿maybe you... ﻿Maybe you could help me out. ﻿Weak. ﻿Listen, the guy's sitting at home doing whatever he's doing, ﻿suddenly you come along, knock on his door, ﻿interrupt him, ﻿he just wants you out of there. ﻿He'll toss you 20 shekels just to get you to leave. ﻿You need a story, ﻿always have a story. ﻿For instance, you say: ﻿Last night ﻿I was talking to my daughter the bride. ﻿I said to her: ﻿We can't afford a wedding hall. ﻿"What can I do? We can't afford it." ﻿My daughter asked me: ﻿"Daddy, what'll we do?" ﻿I said to her: ﻿"If we can't afford a hall, ﻿"we'll have the wedding in the synagogue next door. What's wrong with that?" ﻿As soon as she hears that ﻿she starts to cry. ﻿She cries and cries. She doesn't stop. ﻿I couldn't take it. ﻿I said to myself: I don't care what happens, ﻿my daughter isn't getting married in a synagogue. ﻿My daughter will get married in a fancy hall, ﻿23 dollars a plate, ﻿we'll have a band, ﻿a photographer. ﻿Whatever she wants. ﻿How can I say such a thing? It's a lie. ﻿One thing you should remember, a story is never a lie. ﻿So who's first in line? ﻿Weissbecker. ﻿The guy's childless. Poor man. ﻿Tell him you'll invite him and his wife to the wedding. ﻿He lives upstairs, in that mansion. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Hello, ma'am. -Yes? ﻿my name is Nachman. ﻿I was wondering, ﻿do you have a story for me? ﻿A story? ﻿Do you realize you've called a pay phone? ﻿Yes. do you mind? One little story. ﻿What a crazy world.. ﻿All right. ﻿I'll tell you a story. ﻿My husband, bless his soul, is a very pious man. ﻿I came home the other day ﻿and he looked at me and asked: ﻿"Excuse me, who are you? What are you doing here?" ﻿I said: Shmuel, what do you mean? ﻿"I'm Hedva, your wife. ﻿"We have 37 grandchildren ﻿"and 17 great-grandchildren." ﻿To make a long story short, ﻿We have a record by the Beatles in the attic. ﻿Ever heard of the Beatles? ﻿Sure. ﻿He used to listen to it all the time. ﻿I want to play the record for him again, ﻿that way he'll definitely remember who I am. ﻿So why don't you do it? ﻿Here's my problem... ﻿I don't have a phonograph. ﻿People don't listen to records any more. ﻿If I hear anything I'll let you know. ﻿Good. We live at 22 Avtalion Street. ﻿No problem. All the best. ﻿Hedva, ﻿where have you been all day? ﻿I don't know, where've you been? ﻿Who are you? ﻿Hedva, 'm Shmuel, your husband. ﻿I don't know any Shmuel. ﻿Hedva, it's me. ﻿Did you go inside? ﻿Did you sit in his living room? ﻿He didn't want to hear a word. ﻿He just handed me the money. ﻿Don't ask for permission. ﻿Open the door. You make the rules. ﻿You go inside. ﻿There are those jerks who just open the door a crack. ﻿You have to be smart, ﻿you tell him you're thirsty, ﻿you ask for a glass of water. ﻿Next thing you know, you're inside. ﻿Well, with God's help. ﻿Avraham Simcha Rosenbaum. ﻿Piece of cake. ﻿You have a reference from his rabbi, right? ﻿The second he opens the door you hand him the reference. ﻿Knock loud, he's hard of hearing. ﻿Tell me, ﻿what is this? ﻿What do you think it is? ﻿A notebook. ﻿Very good. ﻿In this notebook I have the details of every rich man in Bnei Brak. ﻿You don't say. ﻿Where they live, when they're at home, ﻿where they pray, ﻿what their story is. Everything. ﻿Hello. -Yes? -Can I come in for a minute? ﻿What for? ﻿It's important. ﻿I'm in a delicate situation, ﻿I'd like to come in and talk to you. ﻿Just for a few minutes. ﻿Here. Good luck. All the best. ﻿Can I... ﻿What's up, Frischman? ﻿Listen... ﻿What? ﻿Bentzelovitch started working as a truck driver. We could pull off some serious jobs. ﻿Go on. ﻿Bentzelovitch, how much do you charge for a night? ﻿With or without a driver? ﻿You think I can drive a truck? ﻿800 shekels a night. ﻿Not including gas. ﻿And for a day? ﻿I work in the daytime. ﻿Okay. Anyway, for 800 shekels we have a truck all night. ﻿What'll you do with a truck? ﻿That's the easy part. I have a few ideas. ﻿First of all, trolleys. ﻿Supermarket trolleys? ﻿No, stupid. Baby trolleys. ﻿All the stairwells are full of baby trolleys. ﻿So? -So we go around one night, ﻿pick up all the trolleys, load 'em up, ﻿and that's that. ﻿What'll you do with the trolleys? ﻿I have a connection with a dealer in the West Bank. ﻿20 shekels a trolley. ﻿A thousand trolleys, that's a nice bundle. ﻿Are you crazy? ﻿How cruel are you? -He's right. ﻿Fine. Have it your way. ﻿Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay. ﻿Ay-ay-ay ﻿Little lamb, ﻿wake up. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Is Mommy back? ﻿No, she's isn't back yet. ﻿Where is she? ﻿Get dressed. ﻿All right. ﻿I said to myself, I haven't been to Ramat Gan in almost ten years. ﻿As long as I'm here I'll go to Moshko's eat a Sabrina, ﻿like we did on all our anniversaries. ﻿I get there and what do I see? ﻿Well? ﻿No Moshko's, no Sabrinas. ﻿They opened a Starbucks there. ﻿Just a second. -what? ﻿You wouldn't believe it. ﻿There's a girl standing there... ﻿Hold on, let me hear this. ﻿Hello? Hello? Are you with me? ﻿Very good. ﻿We'll continue next week... ﻿My little lamb. ﻿Are you hungry? ﻿A little. ﻿Delicious, huh? ﻿Why don't you eat your chicken? ﻿I don't like chicken. -All right. ﻿Make it quick, have to be at work at eight. ﻿Can I come with you? ﻿Don't be silly. It's late. ﻿You have school tomorrow. ﻿When will you be back? ﻿Very late. ﻿I'm scared of sleeping alone. ﻿What's there to be scared of? ﻿Last night I couldn't fall asleep. ﻿Let's see what desserts they have today. ﻿You have to sit quietly and not disturb us, ﻿is that clear? -All right. ﻿It would be best if you slept. ﻿Transplant? Your kidney? ﻿Yes. ﻿At your age? ﻿God have mercy. ﻿That's rough. ﻿How old are you, kid? ﻿Let's think, what does every 21-year-old dream of? ﻿Getting married. -Very good. ﻿What else? ﻿Raising a family? ﻿If you're dry, your audience will be, too. ﻿You're right. ﻿Let's say you tell him: ﻿I got engaged to a smart girl from a good family, ﻿a real looker. ﻿The thing is... ﻿you were diagnosed with a disease. ﻿They called everything off. ﻿Your life is in ruins. ﻿You say to yourself: ﻿Who would want to... ﻿marry me with this disease? ﻿Who? ﻿Like that. ﻿Elaborate a little, spice it up, ﻿tell him all your troubles, ﻿your father's troubles, your grandmother's troubles. ﻿Get it? ﻿Yes. -Whatever it takes. ﻿That's the building, first floor. ﻿There's no sign on the door but his name is Birnbaum. ﻿He's been a widower for years. He's just waiting to make a friend. ﻿You'll be his friend. ﻿Go inside and tell him about your life. ﻿Be open, tell him about your troubles too, ﻿don't be shy, ﻿the more you open up the better it'll work, get it? ﻿Yes. ﻿Knock loud. ﻿Go on. Good luck. ﻿What? ﻿Will you come with me? ﻿My friend, if I go, I don't need you, ﻿I would go by my self, you see? ﻿Go on, it'll be fine. ﻿Heaven help me. ﻿Daddy, ﻿why don't you just go with him? ﻿Chani, what did I tell you? ﻿It's okay, I'll be all right. ﻿You know what? Wait a sec. Come here. ﻿Open it. ﻿"Bless You, O Lord, Who creates all with His word. ﻿Now you can go. ﻿This is the last time I take you to work. ﻿Little lamb... ﻿Little lamb. ﻿Let's go. Bedtime. ﻿Chanileh, when I was about 12 ﻿and my father died ﻿I took it very hard ﻿and so did my mother, Grandma Tirza. ﻿She was really heartbroken ﻿and a month after he died she sent me to seminary in Kfar Hassidim. ﻿That's where I grew up. ﻿Where did you eat and sleep? ﻿There, I had a room, at the boarding school. ﻿The headmaster was my friend, ﻿we studied together. ﻿And his wife was always in the kitchen ﻿and while we studied she made us dinner. ﻿She'd put a pat of margarine in the hot pan ﻿and pour the egg over it. ﻿I'll never forget the way it smelled. ﻿The margarine and the egg. ﻿It smelled like home. ﻿Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God the Lord is one." ﻿Blessed be His Majesty's name forever and ever." ﻿"May the angel who saves me from all evil ﻿"bless the youths and call them by my name ﻿"and the names of my forefathers Abraham and Isaac ﻿"and multiply on earth..." ﻿Good night, little lamb. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿If I were you, I'd get out of here. ﻿You know how much a driver earns in Williamsburg? ﻿How much? -That's where the money is. This is small-time. ﻿Get on a flight to Brooklyn. ﻿I'm not flying anywhere. ﻿I have a daughter, she has school, friends, a life. ﻿Don't be ridiculous. ﻿Did you hear it's gonna snow in Jerusalem? ﻿What snow? ﻿I remember the big snowstorm of the year 5762. ﻿I remember the whole family standing at the window, ﻿my mother sent me and my brother ﻿to get a jerrycan of kerosene from the basement, ﻿we go downstairs, ﻿shine the flashlight on the basement, ﻿when suddenly we see a tired-out cat ﻿lying there ﻿with five teeny little kittens nursing from her. ﻿Unforgettable. ﻿I think that's my very first memory. ﻿How about you, Bentzelovitch? ﻿Me? ﻿What's the first thing you remember? ﻿I was three, ﻿My little brother was getting circumcised. In synagogue. ﻿And I remember lots of people standing around and watching ﻿so I pushed my way in, too. ﻿The Rabbi sees me watching. ﻿and he whispers something to someone standing there ﻿and then he comes up to me, takes me aside, ﻿gives me a lollipop and says: "Go play outside." ﻿So I went to play. ﻿Nice. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Frischman, what about you? -What about me? ﻿What's the first thing you remember? ﻿I don't remember anything. ﻿Come on, Frischman, something. ﻿I was a boy. ﻿One day I go out ﻿to ride my bike a little. ﻿Anyway, there was another boy there ﻿a little older than me. ﻿He says to me: "Let's race." ﻿Now, instead of turning at the bottom, ﻿I kept going straight. ﻿I drove right into someone's garage ﻿and fell, boom, with my bike, ﻿right into the garage ﻿and down one whole storey. ﻿The next thing I remember, ﻿I wake up in my mother's bed ﻿and she's holding me and crying. ﻿She cried her eyes out. I'll never forget it. ﻿She was afraid something happened to me. ﻿I must've passed out. ﻿Good story. ﻿Way to go, Frischman. ﻿But snow is so beautiful. ﻿Too bad we're stuck like schmucks here in Bnei Brak. ﻿Did you know it snowed once in Bnei Brak? ﻿Yeah, sure. ﻿It's like talking to the wall... ﻿It snowed in Bnei Brak 70 years ago. ﻿Ask your grandfather. ﻿Hey, you gave me a brilliant idea. We're gonna pull off a big one. Listen. We take Bentzelovitch's truck... ﻿Not the truck again... -Just listen. ﻿We drive to Jerusalem at night ﻿before the snow starts to stick ﻿and load the truck with snow. ﻿We load it up with snow, drive back to Bnei Brak, ﻿we unload the snow, and then what? ﻿What? ﻿Everyone in Bnei Brak comes to play in the snow. ﻿Get it? -Got it. It's your turn. ﻿Good idea. Really. ﻿Hold on. Ruzumny, you sneak, ﻿you got everyone else to talk. What about you? -What about me? ﻿What's the first thing you remember? ﻿The first thing I remember? ﻿That's easy. ﻿Well? ﻿My son's funeral is the first thing I remember. ﻿Nothing that was before will ever be again, my friends. ﻿Nothing. ﻿Your call is transferred to the voicemail. ﻿You've reached the voicemail of 052-63924... ﻿Step outside. ﻿Move it. Outside. ﻿Where is it? -Where's what? ﻿Where's my notebook? ﻿You had your eye on it. ﻿It's all right. ﻿You had your eye on it, I saw. Where's my notebook? ﻿With the addresses? -Yeah. You took it. ﻿God forbid. What are you thinking? ﻿I've never taken anything that wasn't mine. ﻿Swear to me. ﻿I can't swear, but I promise ﻿I promise I didn't touch your notebook. ﻿Swear it! ﻿I swear, ﻿I didn't touch your notebook. ﻿Sorry I suspected you, ﻿I just don't know what I'll do without it. ﻿Would you like something to drink? ﻿To drink? ﻿All right. ﻿Coffee? Tea? ﻿We have soup, too. ﻿Soup? ﻿I'll have soup. ﻿It's good soup. ﻿Yes, little girl? ﻿Shouldn't you be in school? ﻿How much is this? -10 a piece. ﻿I have a shekel and a half. ﻿There's nothing for a shekel and a half. ﻿Can I have a little piece? ﻿Little girl, I don't have time to fool around. ﻿I'll give you one book of stationery. ﻿What'll I do with it? ﻿It's perfumed. ﻿All right, I'll give you a piece. ﻿I need the rest of my stationery back. ﻿You're getting nothing back. ﻿But I said just one. ﻿Don't drive me crazy. ﻿But that's stealing. It's worth way more than ten shekels. ﻿Don't sass me! Go away and never come back! ﻿How was school today? ﻿Okay. ﻿Did you study hard? ﻿Yes. ﻿What did you learn today? ﻿Are you hungry? ﻿A little. ﻿My wife, Levana Somech Rest in peace... ﻿You are welcome to comfort us at our home. ﻿Everything melts, gentlemen. ﻿Everything melts. ﻿I want to show you something. ﻿Did you know Levana? ﻿You could say that. ﻿Really? ﻿Come in, sit down. There's plenty of room. ﻿Have a seat. ﻿Thank you. ﻿It isn't fresh. ﻿You see this? ﻿Yehezkel, ﻿that's inappropriate. ﻿Put it away. ﻿Here. ﻿Smell it. ﻿Pass it on. ﻿I bought it for Levana, may she rest in peace. ﻿I bought it for our first anniversary... ﻿Smell it. ﻿Everything melts, gentlemen. ﻿Hello? -Hello, Ehrlich? -Yes. ﻿This is Ruzumny, the Driver. ﻿Yes. How are you? We're meeting by Itzkovitch at 7:00. ﻿Yes, but there's a problem. ﻿What is it? ﻿I lost all my addresses. ﻿We'll have to play it by ear. ﻿But what... ﻿What's a driver worth without addresses? ﻿﻿I was counting on you. ﻿What do I do now? ﻿Here's a rule of thumb for you: Never count on anyone. ﻿﻿If you want to come, come. ﻿If you don't, find yourself another driver. ﻿Fine. That's what I'll do. Thanks a lot. ﻿What do you need him for? ﻿Daddy. ﻿What? ﻿What do you need him for? ﻿What do you mean, what do I need him for? ﻿He's a beggar. He has a story. ﻿He has references from rabbis. ﻿I don't have anything. ﻿We could collect money together. ﻿We'll make up a story. ﻿What story? ﻿We'll say that... ﻿I need surgery right away ﻿so you have no choice but to beg for money. ﻿They'll give us lots of money. ﻿Don't be ridiculous. Don't say such things. ﻿Why not, Daddy? ﻿You must remember some people. ﻿What do you think? ﻿A man sees a beggar coming in with a child. ﻿What comes to his mind? ﻿He realizes he's dealing with a lowlife, we won't see a penny. We’re wet enough, let's go. ﻿I'll do the talking. ﻿You don't say a word, got it? ﻿I'll tell them a story, don't worry. ﻿Yes? ﻿Hello. Sorry to disturb you. ﻿It's all right. ﻿We got stuck in the rain down here, ﻿I have a little girl here and she's very cold. ﻿I'm worried about her. ﻿Maybe you could make her a cup of tea. ﻿All right. Come on up. ﻿Another beggar, I'll bet. ﻿Please come in. ﻿Come in, come in. ﻿Sit down. -Welcome. -Come in. -Thank you. ﻿Make yourselves at home. -I'll make you a hot drink. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Don't I know you? ﻿No. ﻿I don't think so. ﻿You've never been here before? ﻿No. No. ﻿I know you. You're the Driver. ﻿No. What makes you think that? ﻿You're Ruzumny, you bring me all the beggars in Bnei Brak. ﻿Don't you think I know that? ﻿Have a seat. We need your help. That's why we're here. ﻿Why? What's the matter? ﻿My father and I are all alone. ﻿What do you mean, all alone? ﻿Until... ﻿Until about six months ago we led a perfectly normal life. ﻿My wife and I lived here in Bnei Brak ﻿and we raised two children, Chami ﻿and Moishie, her little brother. ﻿And about 6 months ago tragedy struck. ﻿Moishie was only four when it happened, ﻿he was playing in the parking lot. ﻿when a car drove by ﻿and ran him over. ﻿You must've heard about it. ﻿Yes, I remember reading about it in the paper, ﻿it was heartbreaking. ﻿My wife took it very hard, ﻿there's nothing more tragic than parents burying their children. ﻿I remember seeing ﻿how they buried him ﻿wrapped in a prayer shawl. ﻿His body was so tiny. ﻿Suddenly I started thinking about wasting one's seed. ﻿You bring a child into the world, ﻿you raise him, ﻿you play with him, ﻿and then he's taken away, ﻿just like that. ﻿I said to myself, ﻿if that's what God wants, ﻿who am I to question Him? ﻿But my wife, ﻿she had a lot of claims against God. ﻿She wanted us to move to Tel Aviv ﻿and start a whole new life, ﻿but I refused. No way. ﻿On one hand I wanted to help her, ﻿I wanted to be with her, ﻿to do it for her sake, ﻿but I couldn't stand to see her so broken and in pain. ﻿It kept reminding me of Moishe. ﻿So for six months I stayed away from home at night, ﻿I wandered around ﻿and only came home in the morning. ﻿And then, a few days ago, ﻿she picked up and left. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Chani. -Chani. ﻿Come, little lamb, we're leaving. ﻿No, stay with us. -No, no. ﻿It's okay, we're about to eat. ﻿Wait a minute. ﻿Here. -No, no. I don't want... -I want you to have it. ﻿Do me a favor and take it. ﻿Put it in your pocket. ﻿Look, Daddy. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿How much is admission? ﻿Can't you see it's closed? It's winter. ﻿Come back in the summer. ﻿Can't we come in for a minute? ﻿Come in? We came a long way. Just one ride on the Ferris wheel. ﻿I can't, buddy. I'm sorry. ﻿Never mind. We'll come back one day. ﻿Hey! ﻿Are you the psychiatrist? -Yes. ﻿Nice dog. ﻿Are you crazy? You think that's a dog? ﻿That's a boot. ﻿Therefore, You should have come to me earlier. ﻿The truth is I never thought about visiting a psychiatrist. ﻿But if everyone says you're drunk, you'd better lie down. ﻿Where are we going? We’re going to Grandma's. ﻿You'll be staying there for a while. ﻿Why? ﻿That's how it is. ﻿Oh, what a nice surprise. ﻿Hello, Mom. ﻿I was about to run out to the grocery store but come on in. ﻿Chanileh, ﻿stay here a minute, I want to talk to Grandma. ﻿I'll come visit. ﻿﻿I will. I promise. ﻿Gimme a hug, I have to run. ﻿Nachman.. ﻿Don't disappear on me. ﻿Don't worry. ﻿No, no. -It's okay, Mom. ﻿Take it back. -A child, It's a lot of expenses. ﻿All right, then. ﻿Bye, Mom. ﻿Take care of yourself. ﻿I've been looking all over for you. ﻿What do you want? ﻿Bentzelovitch got off work early. We're leaving for Jerusalem now. The snow is starting to stick. ﻿If we don't leave soon they'll close the roads. ﻿Do me a favor, you guys, ﻿leave me in peace. ﻿Are you crazy? Everything's ready to roll. ﻿The tickets, the booth, the fences. ﻿Posters everywhere. You have to come. ﻿Leave me alone, I'm in no mood. ﻿I'm trying to cheer you up. ﻿I don't want you to cheer me up! ﻿Did I ask you to cheer me up? -Okay, ﻿I heard you. Enough. ﻿Yes, Mom. What's new? ﻿Nachman, finally you answered. Where are you? ﻿I'm... ﻿in Bnei Brak, where do you think? ﻿Where is Chani? With you? ﻿She's with you, right? ﻿Why would she be with me? -She disappeared. ﻿She isn't here, Nachman. She's gone. ﻿What do you mean, gone? Gone where? ﻿I don't know, We went to bed after dinner, ﻿I felt something was wrong, ﻿I got up and saw she was gone. ﻿When did this happen? -Just now. ﻿We have to call the police. ﻿It's dengerous, we have to. ﻿Don't call, I'll take care of it. ﻿Let me know what happens. -Bye. ﻿There's been a change of plan. Make a U-turn. ﻿In the middle of the highway? ﻿Find a way. -But we're almost there. ﻿I don't care, go back now. ﻿I'll say a prayer and you'll repeat after me. ﻿Okay. ﻿"A song of ascensions. Lord, I called on You from the depths. ﻿Lord, hear my voice, Let your ears be attentive... ﻿Chani ﻿Chani ﻿Chani ﻿If we don't find her within a few minutes we'll go to the police. ﻿Hold on, stop a sec. I want to hear this. ﻿I'm going to see Mommy. ﻿How? you don't know where she is. ﻿The night before she left she asked me ﻿if I want to move to Tel Aviv with her. ﻿Why didn't you go with her? ﻿I didn't want you to be alone. ﻿He chickened out at the last minute, the bastard. ﻿What do you need him for? He's trouble. A loser. ﻿Get moving. ﻿Let's hope they haven't closed the roads. ﻿You won't believe what I dreamt last night. ﻿What? ﻿I'm driving to Haifa ﻿and there's a kiosk in the middle of the road. ﻿And this guy is selling sandwiches there ﻿and I watch how he makes them and it's unbelievable. ﻿He takes this nice bread ﻿like Hoisman used to have, remember? ﻿With the caraway seeds? -Exactly. ﻿Anyway, he slices it neatly, ﻿takes two fresh, delicious-smelling slices, ﻿and spreads them with this fancy yellow butter, ﻿must be imported stuff. ﻿Over that he spreads slices of schmaltz herring, ﻿but not the white kind they sell in stores. ﻿On top of that he grates fresh horseradish, ﻿then a slice of tomato, a little salt, a little pepper, ﻿and serves it to everyone. ﻿And there's a long, long line. ﻿Then, when my turn comes, he skips me ﻿and serves the next guy. ﻿You don't say? ﻿"Hey, mister, it's my turn." ﻿And what does he say to me? ﻿Well? ﻿"No herring for you." ﻿He said that? ﻿I started crying in my dream like a little boy. ﻿But it was no use. ﻿The guy wouldn't make me a sandwich. ﻿And? ﻿Never mind. ﻿Hello? -Ruzumny. ﻿What? -You won't believe it. ﻿what? talk already. ﻿It's all over, kaput. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿The snow, stupid. ﻿What about the snow? ﻿Aren't you in Bnei Brak? ﻿I'm in Bnei Brak. ﻿I just got back from Jerusalem, ﻿the truck is packed with snow. ﻿I get out of the truck ﻿when suddenly it starts to snow, real snow, here in Bnei Brak. ﻿What? ﻿Look out your window. ﻿Hello? ﻿Ruzumny? ﻿Ruzumny? ﻿Hello?
