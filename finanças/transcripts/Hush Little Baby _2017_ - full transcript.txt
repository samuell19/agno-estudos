Can I just get a few more kills? Sure, we could do that. I could also hop on the headset and tell your friends what a wonderful, thoughtful, handsome boy you are. Don't be obscene. Come on, little man. - Have a nice day, boys. - Bye. - Mom. - Bye, Mrs. Bell. Go. Almost made it through a full load this time. I thought dad fixed it. So did I. Perfect. Hi, baby. Oh, ho, come here.

Oh. Hi. Mom, have you seen my lunch? - It's in the fridge. - No, it's not. Yes, it is. Yeah, here we go. Good morning. Hey, you're late. I know, I'm sorry. I still haven't gotten used to the alarm. - Really? - Oh. Hi, baby. Turtle kiss. Well, kiddo, you ready for school? It's okay, I'll take him. - No, it's okay, I'll do it. - It's fine, James. I already got Riley in the car seat. You're gonna be late for your pitch. So just go to work. I'll be in the car. Hey, I'm sorry. You said you were gonna fix the dryer. I know. I will. I can't be the only one trying here. And the latch on the front door is broken. I'll do it tonight, okay? I promise. If you say so. No, no, no, stop. How long are we gonna do this? There's coffee in the pot. Ha ha. - Hey. - You're late. Meeting's not for another 20 minutes. And what about prep? We've been busting our ass on this pitch for the last six months. We're ready. Besides, knowing you, you've been here for the past two hours color coding our talking points. Well, you have 20 minutes to memorize. Oh, wow. I appreciate the level of crafting that went into making these, but... we're good. Lauren, the logo that you designed works fine. I was just hoping for something a little more I don't know, creative? Okay, well... I can definitely mock up some alternatives. Hey... Lauren? You there? Whoa! Oh. I'm-I'm-I'm right here. I'm okay. Yeah. I am right here. Yeah, Gina, sorry. I am here. Okay, so... What were you looking for? Maybe you have some inspirational images you could send me. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to send you my Pinterest page. I think it'll give you a better sense of what I'm looking for. I am emailing you the link now. Perfect. Lauren, are you sure that you're ready to take on this project? I mean, I know that things are busy at home with the baby and everything. What? No! I'm a 100 percent ready. And I'm looking at your Pinterest page right now. It's beautiful. Totally get what you're goin' for. Great, yeah. Alright, so I definitely want something that has the feeling of movement but is captured in still image. So, when people see it, I want them to think... Inspiring. Movement. Dancer. Gina, you've given me so much to work with I'd love to just process it and get back to you later, okay? Yeah, sure. Okay, bye. ♪ Hush little baby ♪ Don't say a word Riley! Hey... Owen. - Yes. - Ha ha ha. To big brother. You two, well done. I have some very lucrative paperwork to draw up. Celebrate. Umm... - Yeah. - Umm... You, you, you seriously did a... You did a great job. You really did a good job in there. - Thank you. - Tsk. Okay. Ah, look, I... I know that this contract is gonna require a lot of work. Lot of overtime, late nights. Yes, I'm-I'm... I can do that. Okay, good, I just wanted to make sure. Um, and... and I know I've said this a hundred times but I'm so, so sorry for... Umm... - I need to... - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Lauren? What? I got here as fast as I could. Is everything okay? Mr. Bell, I'm Detective Schneider. Did your wife fill you in on what happened? Umm, a little, but I'm confused. Did somebody try to break into the house? Well, no, there was no sign of forced entry. But are you aware that the latch on your front door is broken? Yeah, and the... glass door won't shut, I... I know. A crawler and a door that won't close? But what about the woman? Woman? There was a woman, singing. I-I heard her on the baby monitor. When I went up to the nursery no one was, was there. I heard a voice, I'm not crazy. I believe you. Right now, all evidence is pointing to you're being the victim of a baby monitor hack. With these older models, it's pretty easy. You can hop on the channel with a walkie-talkie. Why would somebody do that? A prank? Again, it wouldn't be the first time. And honestly, you were lucky it got you to check on Riley before she crawled into the street. And thankfully, Owen arrived to grab her when he did. Our old neighbor, Owen Leary? Yeah, he stopped by just in time. Hi, James. Hi, Owen. Thank you. I-I hear that we owe you big time. - I'm just glad I was here. - Thank God you were here. Yeah, it could have been a lot worse. Now, unfortunately, there's no way to track or prosecute a hack like this. I suggest upgrading to a newer model to keep it from happening again. And it wouldn't hurt to invest in a password-protected video monitor. Keep an eye on that little devil. Make sure she doesn't make a run for it. We will. Thank you, detective. Is there anything else you need? No. But, Owen, let's review that statement. Yeah, yeah, okay. Owen. - Again, thank you. - Yeah. No problem. Give me a call if there's another hack. And, uh... fix these doors. So, you think it was just a hack? I don't know. Maybe, I guess? I just can't believe Riley could get out like that. And I didn't even notice. It's not your fault. Yes, it is. I have been treading so much water lately. Let me back ya. We can make this work. I'm sure they need you back at the office. I'm not the one who wanted this. Neither did I. Owen. What's goin' on? Check it out. You f, you fixed our door? Yeah, after I talked to the detective I hit up the... hardware store, and... Front door that doesn't stay close, no good. Uh, did Lauren ask you to do that? Ah, she didn't put me to work or anything, but... after what happened I couldn't just leave it broken. Okay. - Well... - Oh. Here you are, sir. Thank you. - Hey, dad. - Hey, buddy. So, uh, Owen's back in town, huh? Yeah, winter break. That's great. Umm, is your mom around? She's out back, doing laundry. Oh, boy. Feeling really bad about that dryer right now. Well, you can help, if it makes you feel better. Ran into Owen. Looks like he's got the door fixed. Yeah, that was nice of him. I was gonna fix it. I know. But now you don't have to. He helped me pick out a nanny cam today too. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Set it up and everything. He can install it on your laptop if you wanna keep an eye on Riley. Seems like he's been quite the help today. He has. I wanted to talk to you about that. I'm... I wanna ask him to help out around the house. What? I know he needs the money, and honestly... ahem, we need the help. So, you want him to be our nanny. - Manny. - Manny? He used to watch Carter all the time. Don't you remember how good he was? And Carter loves him. I don't know. James... I need someone around here. And I've known Owen practically his whole life. I used to babysit him. Okay, look, if that's what you want, then let's ask him. Thank you. Actually, I was thinking about asking him tonight over dinner. I know it's kind of a big decision, so... maybe you wanna come over and... we can ask him together. Yeah, I'd-I'd like that. Hey, Lauren, the oven just went off. Thanks, I'll be right in. Hey... What are you doing for dinner? Wow! Seriously, Lauren, this, this is incredible. Oh, it's really nothing special. Are you kidding? This is heaven. I've been eating ramen off of a hot plate for the last month. College sounds terrible. So, how's it goin'? You still studying music? Yeah, it's been good. Pretty busy. Tryin' to write my own stuff between classes. That's amazing. Well, don't go gushing until you've heard it. So, Owen, are you just passing through or are you gonna stay for a little while? No, I'll-I'll be here. I'm staying at my mom's in Blaine. So, not too far away. Oh, I miss Beth. How is she doin'? I've barely talked to her since you guys moved. Oh, she's been better. She had an accident at work a few weeks ago so, been mostly in bed since. But luckily, campus is only half an hour away so I've been able to finish finals and take care of her. I'm so sorry, that's awful. Maybe I'll give her a call. Yeah, she, uh... she'd like that. I think I might take next semester off and help around the house. 'Cause I doubt she'll be going back to work anytime soon. So... you guys hear of anyone looking to hire a struggling musician without a degree let me know. Actually, we were thinking... You really saved us today. How would you feel about helping out around the house like you used to? - Really? - Definitely. We could use an extra set of hands. We could start up guitar lessons again. I suck. Like, really bad. Of course, I would love to. Well, this is cause for celebration. I'll get the champagne. None for you. Well, looks like we have our Manny. Thank you for being so supportive of this. Of course, it's... whatever's best for the family. That's all I want. And now you have that nanny cam app so you can keep an eye on things. Well, I better get to bed. Things are gonna start revving up at work. We, um, we got that contract. James, that's great. Thanks. Which means we're probably gonna have a lotta late nights again. Kiss the kids goodnight for me. I got you, sweetie. Hmm. Guess it works. Okay, honey. ♪ Hush little baby ♪ Don't say a word ♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ I'm sorry. I-I knocked, but... That's okay. Just jumpy, I guess. We can holster that left hook. I'm here now. I see that freelancing is going strong. Oh. It has its ups and downs but, goin' steady.

But don't worry about it too much 'cause you're a real artist and you'll come up with something brilliant. In the meantime, I'll get started on cleaning the house. You don't have to do that.

I can't remember the last time somebody else cooked dinner. I know it isn't exactly cuisine, but... hopefully it's edible. It's great. Thank you. Well, it's a shame James couldn't join us. Sorry, I shoulda told you earlier. He's, um, not usually here for dinner. Oh. The work keeps him pretty late? Mm-hmm. May I be excused? Oh, you don't want any more? Not hungry. I'm sorry, did I say something? No, it's, it's not your fault. We've all been going through some adjustments lately and we're still figuring it out. Yeah. Carter mentioned something earlier. Obviously, it's none of my business but I don't wanna say something that'll make it worse. He talked to you about it? What did he say? I don't know, Lauren, um... Please. I know he acts like it doesn't bother him, but... I'm worried. He won't talk to me about it. You got something to drink? Carter didn't tell me a lot. Just that you guys were... y-you know... Separated. - Yeah. - It's okay, you can say it. It's, it's weird, 'cause you guys... You always seemed like the happiest couple on the block. We were. And then... he got distant. He started working later and later and... There is a girl at his office. Summer. Oh. Lauren, I'm, I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. When we had Riley, I thought things'll get back to normal. But... Maybe maybe they still will, who knows? Seems like he's trying harder. I am sorry to unload all this on you. But... It's, it's okay, really. If you wanna talk, I'm always happy to listen. I don't think Carter's the only one acting like it doesn't bother him. And if you ignore it it's just gonna make things worse. When did you grow up so much? You are not the boy I used to babysit. No, I'm not. Hey! Hey! Evening, James. Oh, I should go check on her. - You need help? - Oh, no, I got it. What's that? Aw. Crying baby. Oh, no, no, no, no. - Excuse me! Hey! - What? Keep it down, please. There's baby inside trying to sleep. Give me a break, kid. What the hell! What? Oh, come on. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just dealing with Gina. I've been killing myself with these designs for her and she doesn't like any of them. What you need is a break, some fresh air. Yeah, maybe I'll take the yacht out for a spin. I'm serious. Go get outta here. Grab lunch with a friend. - I can't. - Why not? Carter's at school, I can watch Riley. Work's gonna be here when you get back. You'll be gone, what, two hours? We'll be fine. You do deserve it. Yes. Megan. Hi, this is Lauren. What are you doing for lunch? Can you get away from your patients? See you soon, mommy. Bye. What do you think, Riley? Should we keep an eye on him? Yeah. I think we should. I'm not kidding. Do you know what I would give to have a man at my house at my beck and call? - He's a Manny. - Hmm. Not a... whatever inappropriate thing you're imagining. Uh-huh. So, do you have a picture? What? I'm-I'm curious. I mean, I did take time out of my very busy day. - Fine. - Mm-hmm. I think I have a picture of him with Riley. Good, 'cause I need to see that baby girl. Let me see her. Oh, my God! She's beautiful, look at that. And, yeah, that's definitely the model that I would want. - What? - Mm. I just... I swear I've seen him before. Maybe he winked at you online, and you internet-stalked him. Sadly, that's entirely possible. Oh, I missed you. I went from seeing you every week to almost never. Who would've thought I'd miss the clinic? Yeah. Well, so... How are things? With James. Honestly... I don't know. Mm, was it crazy to think that, that things would magically go back to normal once we had Riley? No, it's a difficult process. And even when IVF is successful, it's... Plenty of people still go through depression and anxiety. What am I supposed to do? You know, I tried to include him in everything but he was never there. It's like, all of his focus was at work... or with her. But I do know that I want James to be a part of Riley's life and Carter's. What about yours? No way. I can't believe you fixed it. I have been on James for a week to fix this thing. How did you even know how to do it? I'm a struggling musician. You learn to take whatever job comes your way. I've done IT, sales... handyman. You name it, there's a good chance I've done it. Have I told you how amazing you are? I'll never get tired of hearing it. Now, this load is almost done. Don't even think about folding, I am on top of it. Strum, nice and slow. Yeah. I'm telling you, man, you're getting good. You sure you didn't practice while I was away at school? Don't patronize me. I know how bad I am. Just help me become a rock God. Wow. Carter, you're shredding. Thanks, dad. I appreciate the support. Listen, buddy, I know it's been crazy at the office lately but what do you say I blow off work early tonight we go out, just the two of us? Sorry, dad, I can't. Owen's taking me to a show tonight. I promise you have nothing to worry about. It's a clean band. Well, mostly. Ha ha. Yeah. I'm not worried about it. Mom said it was okay. I can go, right? Yeah. Of course. - Thanks. - Sure, okay. Alright. Let's do it again. Fast. I don't know. Am I, am I overreacting? Maybe. Well, I can't help it. I mean, I've been doing everything I can to make Lauren happy, and this, this kid gets to stay in my house be with my wife, and then, and then he's taking my son to his very first concert. So, yeah, yeah. I'm pissed. I'm kinda pissed. Damn it. Hey. You know, a couple of us are going to McFaren's later. If you wanna come. Yes. Sink those claws in. That won't be a good idea. Right. Well, this got boring. Lauren, where are you? Hey. What's going on? I felt bad bailing on dad today. We haven't really hung out in a while. It got me thinking. What's going on with you and dad? I don't want him to leave. I promise... no matter what happens he will be in your life. Do you understand me? Dad's not going anywhere. Hey, rock star. Show's already over? Um, no. Owen had to cancel. Said he had to help out his mom. Oh. I'm sorry, buddy. I know you were looking forward to that. It's fine. Hey, uh, what's the awful title to that horror movie you've been tryin' to get to us watch? - "Blood Shower?" - "Blood Shower." How about we order some pizza, make some s'mores and watch a bunch of people get hacked to pieces? Really? I mean, if it's okay with your mother. - I'll order the pizza now. - Yes. I'm sorry you guys didn't get the Grubber deal. Yeah. It's okay, we'll get the next one. Mm-hmm. - Um, I'm gonna grab another. - Sure. Yeah. - Can I have a shot of fireball? - Sure. Thanks. Hey. This one's on me, alright? Thanks. Wow. Striking out, huh? Sorry, it's just... It's not really a good night for me. You waiting on somebody? I guess not. Whoa. Now! - I can't believe you. - Lauren, listen to me. I had nothing to do with this. "Lauren, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. She was drunk, she kissed me." Are-are we gonna have the same fight over and over again? Is that... Are you gonna keep sleeping with your coworkers? I saw the photo, James. A woman doesn't just send a photo like this. Well, she did. Oh, really? We never had sex! Do you understand that? You expect me to believe that? Get out. I want you out of the guest house by tomorrow morning. - Lauren... - I don't wanna hear it. Just shut up and leave. I'm gonna go talk to her, and then I'm gonna prove to you that this was a mistake. Get out of my house. It's okay. He's finally gone. I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna fix everything. Hey, Jamesy! Mornin'. Lauren, I'm, I'm so sorry. You wanna talk? I don't know why I thought things would change. - God, I feel so stupid. - Oh, don't say that. You're brilliant. You're creative... incredible... beautiful. If James can't see how amazing you are he's the stupid one. Oh, my God. James. Detective Schneider. This is Detective Klein from Homicide. We need to talk. Creative block? Something like that. Well, it's a curse of being an artist. Our muses can be very fickle. Believe me, I know. Owen... You're still thinkin' about it too. No. No. That was a mistake. I was hurt and confused... and I just wanted... I just wanted to feel appreciated again. It never should have happened. And it can't happen again. Her roommate found her this morning. Hanging from the rafters with an extension cord around her neck. Medical examiner hasn't published a report yet but, seems pretty cut and dry suicide. Last contact she had while alive was the text she sent to you. So, any information you can give us will be helpful. For the both of us. Because honestly, if this isn't a suicide then... you're the only lead we've got. I'm gonna go for a walk and clear my head. Don't worry about Riley, I'll take her with me. I'm sorry it happened. So, anything you want to say? Well, if anything comes to mind or you just wanna grab a coffee and chat, give me a call. - Lauren. - Just leave me alone. - Summer's dead. - What? Can I please come inside? Owen, I-it's fine, I invited him in. Actually, why don't you take Carter out back? James and I need to talk. Come on, let's go check on your sister and practice. I don't... - How'd it happen? - Suicide. At least that's what the police think. "What the police think?" I mean... You don't agree? Lauren, I knew Summer, and I don't think that she'd send those pictures, and I know that she would not kill herself especially over something that's not even there. What are you saying? Things were gettin' better. I feel like we're starting to get everything back on track and then... he shows up. - Owen? - He disappeared last night. He was supposed to take Carter to the concert. Right? Yeah, and then he cancels last second. You're not suggesting what I think you're suggesting? Why not? Do you know how insane you sound? They don't even know each other. - It doesn't... - And what evidence do you have? Why, James? Why? What possible reason would he have to do something that... that's even remotely plausible... Because I see the way that he looks at you. I see what he is doing to this family. What? I saw you. - In the nursery. - You were watching us? I was using the nanny cam, the one that you installed and I saw you kissing him. You don't get to be angry about that. That was a mistake, and I did it because I was shattered, James. Shattered after everything you have done to me. Everything you have done to this family. - How dare you! - No. Owen, leave! No. James, you leave. Now! What? Man, you take one more step closer to me I will put you in the hospital. Stop it. She told you to leave. Get out of our house. Okay. No, James! Get out! Stop! - Stop! - Dad! 911. What's the nature of your emergency? H-hello, there's an intruder at my house. Send someone as fast as you can. Police are on their way, James. Go get some ice. Don't move, don't move. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I've had worse. Thank you. You could've just as easily let them arrest James. And then that would just make you upset. Let me... Sorry. It's not your fault. I cannot believe James did this. I can. What? Based on what I've seen lately. Plus, some women are just worth fighting for. Whatever you doing? Owen. No. A guy stands up for you... and this is how he gets treated? I didn't, I didn't ask you to fight my husband. That was the two of you acting like children. Why are we dancing around this, Lauren? We both know that we want this. You need to go home. Right now. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm woozy from the concussion James gave me just let me-let me stay. Get out. We can talk when your head's back on straight. Go. Fine. We'll talk tomorrow. The Manny? Okay, look, I know I sound crazy but ever since he came to our house... Do you have any proof? No. Okay, that's a great start. So, what am I supposed to do with this information? I don't know, investigate? - Why would I be making this up? - Well, I can think of a reason. You're worried the medical examiner's gonna come back and say "Summer didn't kill herself." That the text she sent you, doesn't make you look so good. Are you accusing me of something? Not as long as we leave this as a suicide. See, I like to have some shred of evidence before jumping to conclusions. Then again, between the picture Summer texted you and the squad car that was sent to your house last night... Don't look so surprised. A 911 call was placed to a house that's part of an open investigation. You're lucky that kid isn't pressing charges. He's lucky that I didn't kill him. You should keep your mouth shut. You want my advice? Unless you've got something to go on don't be so eager to cry wolf. And you better pray that examiner's report comes back clean. 'Cause if there's even a hint that there was a struggle well, our, our next talk... won't be so pleasant. Okay, that was a good one. One more? Oh. Good job. Mom? Hey, sweetheart. You okay? No. Your dad... Honestly, I don't know what he was thinkin'. It's not that. I don't care about Owen. I care about dad. I care about us... being a normal family again. And, and I know it's not very likely. But, it's... it's less likely with Owen still here. You don't need him, right? I could do more chores help with Riley. Just whatever you need. Oh. You know that you and your sister are the most important things in the world to me, right? And we are a family. And nothing is gonna come between us. So, if you want me to fire Owen I will kick him out on his butt. I don't think it's gonna work with him, anyway. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. This'll only take a moment. Shh. There we go. There you go. Shh. I know you didn't mean what you said. I know we both feel the same way about each other. There're just too many complications. Now I realize you're always gonna put Carter before me. But deep down... Hey, can you move? Stay with me. Deep down I think we both know he doesn't really belong in this family. Lauren... You tried for eight years to have another baby. That's how badly you wanted to replace him. That's how much you wanted to make it work. So, now I'm gonna do what you can't... for the sake of this family. Goodbye, Carter. Oh, what am I doing? Oh, my God. Hi, it's Lauren, leave a message. Lauren... Lauren, please call me back. I need to know that you're okay. Okay? I'm at Owen's house. And, just... Please, call me back. James... James... I know you're in my house, James. Sorry, I'm not there.

This is what I propose, James. You leave, and get out of our lives forever so Lauren and me can start our family now. You're insane. That's what my mother said. She didn't think we belonged together either. But I'm not insane. I'm just committed, unlike some people. Lauren, I will never leave you. Okay? You stay!

You had the perfect house perfect children, and you threw it all away because it got hard. Because of some girl? - What... - Shut up! Shut up! I'm gonna fix what you broke. And I'm gonna give you a chance to make it right. How? You're gonna get down on your knees and you're gonna beg for forgiveness, for mercy before I kill you. No. And if you don't I may have to turn my attention to someone else here. You wouldn't hurt them. Maybe, you're right. I would never hurt Lauren or Riley. But, uh, if I'm being honest, James I never cared for Carter. - Mom... - No, Owen... No! No! Owen, please. Owen, please. So, what's it gonna be, James? Will you actually do something to help this family? - Dad... - Okay. James, no. Owen, Owen, let them go. I-I'm the one you want. He's done hurting you, this ends now. Do it! Lauren, I love you and I'm sorry. Carter, I want you to watch out for your mom and your little sister, okay? I guess that'll do. Goodbye, James. I'm really not gonna miss you. Carter. Go, run! Oh... Lauren, get out of here. Ah... No! Carter? Lauren? Lauren? Where's Riley? Where's our baby? She's in our room. "Our room?" Are you sure this is right? Kiddo, I'm an engineer, I'm pretty sure I know how to put some Swedish furniture together. Now, is this piece A or piece G? Dad, it's backwards. I knew that. I'm gettin' the instruction manual. Thanks. Dad's staying for dinner, right? Sure. Think it'll get done today? I told you I'd build it. So, you have nothin' to worry about. Let me see that. Oh. Hey, Megan. - How are you? - Hey, Lauren. I just saw the story on the news. - Is everything okay? - Everyone's fine. We've just been readjusting the last couple days. Everything's looking good. Remember at lunch the other day? Now I know where I recognized Owen from. Lauren, he-he used to work at the clinic. What? Yeah, he was a medical assistant. But he got fired after he tampered with some of the records. I know whose files he accessed. I'm, I'm not certain, but... I think he might have switched out James' sample. ♪ Hush little baby ♪ Don't say a word ♪ Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ ♪ And if that mockingbird don't sing ♪ ♪ Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪
