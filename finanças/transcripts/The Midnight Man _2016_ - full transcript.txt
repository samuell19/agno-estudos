- Anna. - I'm trying. Don't rush me! - Hurry. - Five seconds left. - I know! - Four. Three. Two. One. Time's up. He's coming. It's going to kill us... ...like the others. No. He can't. We're safe as long as we stay in the circle. Where is he? Do you see him? I don't want to play this game anymore. None of us do. This game is over! Not yet. I don't want to die. - Mary. Mary! Get back in the circle, quick! - It's going to get me. Mary, get back in the circle! - No, I can't. - Mary, get back in the circle! - Mary! Mary! - Anna, help me! - Come on! - It's going to get me! Anna, help me! No, not the dark! No! No! No! Anna, fix the circle, quick! There. Mary? You can't hurt us. We're in the circle. The candle is lit. It's... it's almost 3:33. We won. You have to leave. It's the rules. We followed the rules! The game is over! You lose. Help me. Help me. Run! Shh. Listen. What is it? I thought... ...he's coming. - We have to hide. - He'll find us. I'm so scared. Shh. Where is he? Come on! - Wait! It's against the rules. - Forget the rules, Anna. We have to escape. Now's our chance. He'll kill you, like the others. Anna, please. It's just a game. We have to go now! You can't leave the house! It's a rule! Anna, come on! You can't leave the house! It's against the rules. We have to go! Anna! Max! No! No! Max! No! No! - Grandma Anna? - No. - Let's get you back to bed. - No. No. Thank God you don't sleepwalk. I'd never find you in this house. Did I scare you? No. What are you doing up so late? Checking on you, young lady. Speaking of which, you should be in bed. Doctor's orders. I'm not a young lady. And look, it's only 8:20. It's early. Okay, come on. Let's get you back in bed. Don't touch me. Okay, well, the doctor said you need to sleep, so... ...come on, can you please go to bed? What are you gonna do? Grams, you need to go to bed. - Come on. - Don't put your hands on me! - Come on, grams. - I'm coming. I don't want the covers. It's too hot. Come on, please. Make sure you do your rounds. Doors locked. The windows sealed tight. And you be mindful of the rose garden. Since your grandpa passed, it has never been the same. Okay, if you need anything, just call. Thank you for coming, Alex. I don't think I could do this without you. Of course you could. You're a tough chick. - I love you. - I love you. Thank you for finding my burettes. Of course, grams. Hey, stranger. It's Friday night. Yeah. Again. - So, what's up? - Just killing time. You? YouTubin'. As always. There's this crazy video with this guy and this cat. I can't stop watching it. I don't know why he's doing this. - Aw. - What? I just broke one of the wax flowers. I don't know what that means. So you want some company tonight? Like old times. Yeah, come over around 10:00? Plan. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. Want to watch a movie or something? Your grandma finally get a TV? Nope. I keep forgetting that. By the way, it's so awesome that you're back in town. Sorry about your grandma though. She getting any better? No. Just older. But everything happens for a reason, right? Um, not really, but you can pretend that's true. I won't stop you. So, how did you get roped into nurse duty? I mean, it's cool you're doing it and all but what about your school? School can wait. And to answer your real question... ...I guess I just love her. Besides, it's not like she has anybody else. Only you, Alex. Only you. Hello? What are you doing? Fixing stuff. Perfect. - Nonsense! I have every right! - Hey, I gotta go. - Don't you tell me... - All good. I'll see you later. Oh, don't forget to leave the front door open for me. - Yeah, will do. Bye. - Red is the color of roses. Red is the color of... Red is the color of... Nail polish. Red is the color of tomato soup. # Red is the color of roses # # Red is the color of roses ## Nana? Everything okay in here? Alex? What is it, dear? It's nothing, I just... I thought I heard something. Do you need something? No, not really. Miles is coming over tonight. I always liked that Miles boy. Don't really care for the rest of them. The rest of who, nana? There is no rest of them. Not likely. Do you remember my roses? I do. I remember the roses. I remember my roses. My roses. Oh. I haven't tended to them in years. Oh, how I loved my flowers. Sometimes... ...people forget... ...painful memories. They push them aside for new ones. For better ones. Okay, well, are you sure you don't need anything? I'm fine. Really. Okay. Alex? There is one thing. Could you fetch me my hand mirror, please? Sure. You won't find it there among my things. It's not there. - Do you remember where it is? - I do. It just came to me. I can picture it in my mind... ...clear as a bell, one of my favorite things. Besides you and your mother, of course. God rest her soul. Oh, how I loved... ...my silver vanity mirror. The last time I recall seeing it, it was in Grandpa Luster's travel chest. - Where's that? - Why, it's in the attic, of course... ...where it's always been. What is the matter with you? Okay. I'll try and find it for you. This place is falling apart. Please don't be the boogeyman. Shit! Okay, now you're scarier than the boogeyman. Let's just cover you back up. There you are. Boo. Really, Miles? I made it. - When did you get so jumpy? - Jumpy? - What's all this stuff? - How did you know I was in the attic? The light was on, I saw it when I drove up. Look, I'm here now, so everything is cool. Guns. And knives. - You hit the mother load. - Yeah, well, I was looking for this. Okay? Don't ask. Grandma. Got it. You know, come to think of it, your grandma never let us come up here that much... ...when we were little. Did she? No, not really. It was always off limits. Can you help me put this stuff away? You think this thing works? I don't know. Maybe. I found these. No. I know what you're thinking and the answer is "No." Absolutely no way. I'm not stupid. Hey, we should totally call Kelly. I know for a fact she's staying home tonight. Unless, of course, you're not into it. Maybe. She still practicing goth? Yeah, sorta. Well, kinda. No. No, not really, no. Okay. Cool. Hey, what do you think of this? It's heavy. And there's definitely stuff in it. I want to know what's inside. Well, it looks like somebody really didn't want it opened. Like ever. - Is it bad? - Is what bad? - If we open it? - I don't know. It could be nothing. It could be a stash of money... ...or your granny's favorite childhood toy or... ...it could be something you're not supposed to see. So, it's totally up to you. But I say we do it. - Open it. - Why me? 'Cause then I won't be lying when I say I didn't do it. Good thinking. Salt shaker. A candle. A pencil. Okay, we're safe. None of this changes my opinion of grandma. - Wait. Is this blood? - What? Yeah. It is blood. "Anna?" That's granny... - "Max?" - Who? My grandma had a brother. His name was Maximilian, Max for short. She never talked about him much. I think he died of polio or something. Wow. Look who I found. "Max Luster, age ten. Fear, scared of spiders." "Mary Wellington, age nine. Fear, scared of the dark." "Josh Christopher, age ten. Fear, scared of drowning." Weird. No! You opened the game! - Grams? - Holy shit. Thank you so much for coming. Is she gonna be alright? Oh, yes, I am confident she'll recover. Storm is really moving in. Ah. Good. Thank you for fetching my bag. - What's that for? - Um... ...I'm not quite sure actually. Allen, the stethoscope, if you please. Yes, of course, Doctor Harding. Here you are. Thank you. And, uh, if you would be so good as to prepare an injection? - Yes. - 25 CC only. Injection? It's a vitamin cocktail really. Nothing too serious. Your grandmother has been taking them for years. It helps with the dementia. I have never seen her so scared... ...up in the attic... It was... It was really creepy. Well, uh, Anna should be just fine. She has a strong heart. Alex, um, look, I know this has been hard on you... ...but you must understand that, uh ...sometimes getting old... ...well, it's just not that much fun. She's resting now, she should be right as rain in the morning. Allen, you finish up here. Yes, sir. Any other instructions? No, no, uh... just join us, uh, downstairs when you're done here. Miles, Alex? Can we have a word downstairs? Sure. You said she fainted in the attic? Yeah. We, uh, carried her back to bed. The attic? I still can't believe Anna made it that far. She hasn't left her room in years. Perhaps it might be a good idea if you would lock her door... ...from the inside. Now, I know that sounds rather harsh... ...but, uh, even wandering around one's own home can be extremely dangerous. Especially in this old house. Ah, so, uh, I took the liberty of... ...writing down my private office number. Give me a call on Monday, we'll talk. Will do. You're a very blessed woman, Ms. Luster. I hope my little boy treats me the way your granddaughter treats you. Sleep well. Everything alright, Allen? Yes. She was sleeping soundly when I left her. I put a bottle of aspirin at the end of the table for you... ...in case she wakes up a little sore. I would also recommend... ...perhaps a nice hot bath with a little bit of Epsom salt... Does wonders for soothing the occasional bump and bruise. Sound advice, doctor. And in the meantime, just, uh, keep an eye out on your grandmother. She can be pretty stubborn, as you know. Uh, she's sleeping now, so I'm guessing you'll have an easy night of it. Alexandra... ...you're doing a good thing here. Your mother would be proud. The world lost a fine soul the day she passed... ...and for that, I am truly sorry. Thank you, Doctor Harding. Means a lot. Shall we? Goodnight. Strong as a horse. Yes, she is. You never told me the story behind her. Oh, not much to tell. Old family, old money. To be sure, they've had more than their fair share of sorrow. How so? How sorrow can take many shapes and forms. I never would have guessed. This family hides it so well. - Their sadness, that is. - Hmm. Indeed they do. Indeed they do. Wow. Now what? I don't know. Nana said, "You opened the game." What game? What'd she mean? Did you see that look on her face when she saw what we were doing? Are you kidding? I wish I hadn't. She was terrified. Yeah, but of what? Some candles. A salt shaker. A pencil. A sewing needle. The rules. This is the game. The rules. "The midnight game." My! I guess that solves that mystery. Does it? I mean... ...it doesn't look like a fun game. Where's the dice? I don't think it's that kind of game. Listen to this. "To call the Midnight Man into your house, you must follow these steps precisely. "First, you must write your name down on a piece of paper. "Then, using a needle, prick your finger. "Place a single drop of blood next to your name. Light a candle and turn out all the house lights." "Attach the paper with your name and blood mark on it to the front door of your house. "It must be the front door and the door must be made of wood. "Here's where it gets complicated. "At midnight and not a moment sooner, knock 22 times on the door. "You must complete this step before the final stroke of midnight." One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Okay. Now, go outside and blow out your candle. Quickly, get back inside. We have to relight it. What happens now? Let me check the rules. "The Midnight Man is now in your house. Avoid him at all costs until 3:33." - That's it? Did we do it right? - Something's missing. - What? - I don't know. It just says, "You must never fall" and then the page is torn. What now? Let's check the box. It's got to be there. You know my grandma, she's practically a hoarder. I don't know, Alex. I've checked everything. - This might be a loss. - Keep looking. Red is the color of roses. - Red... - I should go check on her. Squeeze the life right out of her. Squeeze the life... Creepy. Do you, um, want me to come with you? After all, the Midnight Man is out there. Waiting. Is he? I'll be okay. Be right back. Oh, Alex, take a candle. - What for? - In case we got it right. The candle part was in the rules. Remember? Right. Stay alive. I think I found something. I definitely found something. Nana? Nana? Everything okay in there? I'm coming in. You in here? One. Two. "You must never fall asleep or stay in the same place during the game. If you do, the Midnight Man will take you." Three. Four. "If your candle blows out you must relight it in 10 seconds..." - Five... - "If it doesn't relight... ...surround yourself with a circle of salt for protection." Six. Seven. "If any of theses rules are broken... ...The Midnight Man will manifest your worst nightmares." Oh, Alex! Grams! Grams! Grams! I've been waiting for you. - No! - What's your fear? No! No! - No! - It's blood. No! No! Red is the color of your blood. It's your blood, Alex! It's your blood! Bleed! Bleed! It's your blood! Your disgusting, disgusting blood! Alex. Alex. Alex! Alex! Alex! Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It's over. It's okay. It's ov... it's over. It's over now. Alex, look at me. Look at me, it's okay. It's okay. It's all over now. It's all over. Okay? What just happened? - It wasn't real, was it? - Yes, yes, it is real. - What are you doing? - I'm pouring a circle of salt. Okay. Now... - ...where's your candle? - My what? - Your candle. Where is it? - I was checking on gram... No, no, no. Stay in the circle! Stay in the circle! You have to stay here. Why? What the hell is going on? You just have to trust me, please. You have to trust me. I found the rest of the rules. Alex, we should have never played this game. Now, where is your candle? I set it on the mantle to come check on the bathroom. - No. Turn that back on. What are you doing? - Trust me. It's safer in the dark. It's safe. Now, you just need to stay in the circle. I'm gonna be right back. Okay? - Where's grams? What happened? - We have to keep moving. No, you have tell me what's going on first. Right here. Right now. Have you ever heard of Pandora's box? Yeah, well, we just opened it. A really bad version of one... ...and I promise you that bad stuff is gonna happen if we stay here. - So we have to move. - What about grams? She's fine. She's not playing the game, so she's safe. I think. Okay, we have to move. Come on. Let's go. Alex. Alex, let's go. When you went to go check on your grandma... here, hold this. After I found the rules, I tried a little experiment. I got it, here. Take this. Take this. Now you have one, that's yours, okay? Listen, Alex. Alex? If we get separated for any reason or if your candle goes out... ...and you can't relight it in ten seconds, exactly ten seconds... ...you have to stop what you're doing and you pour a circle of salt around you... ...and you stay in that circle until you can relight your candle, okay? Or what? I think you know the answer to that. What was your experiment? I blew out my candle. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Alex? You have to die... have to... You have to die too. Alex. I swear to God, if you're trying to scare me... ...it's working. Hello, Miles. Show me your fear. You're afraid of pain. Perfect. One. Two. Three. - Four. - Someone else wants to play. - Ah! - Ten. No! No! Okay. No. No. No. No. No. It's real. Alex. Okay, come on. This is insane. This can't be happening. I think it is. I think it's really happening. So, what, we're just stuck in this house till 3:33 a.m.? Yes. Hey. I tried the front door, but no answer. Hey, dork. Did you, uh, forget to pay the electric bill? Kelly, what are you doing here? I, um, I invited her before we started the game. I didn't think she would show up with the snow and all. Okay, well, this might not be the best timing. Okay. What have you two been doing? Two hours left. Wow. When you guys screw up, you really screw up. That's not really helping. I can't believe you guys called the Midnight Man. I mean, that's the kind of shit that you read about in Creepypastas. You've heard of Creepypastas, right? It doesn't matter. From what I know... ...and from what you've told me... ...the only way for me to help is to join the game. I don't know. This isn't a joke, Kelly. I'm not joking. This thing you saw... ...this Midnight Man... ...it uses your fears against you. Fears you don't even know you have until it's too late. Like subconscious shit. That's the whole point of the game. That's its deal. Well, we know that one already. It's freezing. When the Midnight Man is near, your candle will blow out. - Near? That wasn't in the rules, was it? - No, no. I didn't... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. You guys definitely need my help. Red is the color of roses. Red is the color of roses. Red... is the color of blood. Ow. Kelly, are you sure? You can still leave. And leave my best friends alone to die? Besides, it's just a game. Wait. No, it's not a game. It's real. Right. You're in. Now, all we have to do is avoid the Midnight Man. - This is gonna be fun. - No, it's not. Let's keep moving. Do you still have the mirror? - Yeah. - I want to check something out. This place used to be beautiful... ...until my mom... Um, what are we looking for? I don't know. I... I just keep thinking about how she died. You guys really need a better plumber. Wait, did your mom die in this house? My mom killed herself in this house. Forgive me. That was the last time I saw my mother. Wait a second, you saw all of this? - I thought your mom died in... - Everybody did. That was just a story grams concocted. She said suicide was an embarrassing way to die. And you never said anything. I was ten. I didn't understand anything until now. The game, don't you see? - We found it in the attic. - So? So, what if my mom found it, like we did? What if she played it and lost? - It's possible. - And grandma knew all along. I just remember grams staring into that stupid vanity mirror all the time. I mean, even the night my mom died, she was so cold. Not a single tear. Almost like she was happy. Wow. I thought my family was messed up. Hey, can I see the mirror? Yeah. I always thought grams was just vain. Staring at herself in this thing all the time, but... ...I don't think she was looking at herself. I think she was looking for something else. He's right behind us. He's right there. - There's nothing there. - No. - Your mind's just playing games on you. - No. I saw him, he was right there, smiling. Ah, this is so bad. We should just keep moving, it's getting cold in here. It's too late. Oh, shit! I have matches. Come on! Take my candle. Miles, come on! We're running out of time. Come on! Okay. Okay, let's just go to the attic... ...pour out a giant circle of salt and wait this thing out. - Will that work? - We should try. Yeah. Shit! Here take, take this! Take this. One. Two. Three. Four. - Five. Six. - Come on, Miles! - Seven. Eight. - The wick is wet, it won't light! - Dammit! What do I do? - This isn't working! Don't panic! - What does that mean, don't panic? - Make a circle of protection around you! - Okay? - Okay. Okay. Did I make it? Am I safe? What do we do now? There's candles in the dining room. We'll go get one. - Yeah, yeah. - What? No, somebody stay with me. No, we can't stay in one place. We have to keep moving. No, wait. You guys are just playing with me, right? Listen, just stay in the circle, okay? We're gonna be right back. - Okay? We're gonna be right back. - Okay, but hurry. We will. I'm serious. What is it? How could she let this happen? What's the game still doing in this house? I saw something in my grandma's bathroom. And it really scared me, and I really thought that I was gonna die. Until that moment, I didn't really know what that meant. To die. But I know now. I don't care what happens to me... ...but I do care what happens to you. Alex... ...you know I have always... Okay. We have to destroy the game. Burn it. Throw it away. I don't care. But, Miles, we can't let anybody else die. How could we? I mean... there could be a thousand different boxes... ...like your grandmother's in a thousand different attics all over the place. Well, at least we can destroy it in this one. Oh, this is bullshit. I'm not scared of you. You hear me, Midnight Man? You're a game. An internet urban legend. You don't even exist. And even if you do exist... ...I'm protected. I'm within the circle. That's a rule. You can't break that. I'm not afraid. You should be. Alex? Miles? Guys! No one is coming for you. - Oh, my God. - No, not God. I'm protected. Yes, the salt. You can't do that, it's cheating! Try and stop me. Two can play at that game. Yes! You see that, you fucking freak! Clever girl. I thought you said your grandma kept extra candles. She does. I saw them, they were right here. - Unless she took them? - Your grandma? No, no... ...she couldn't have taken them because we'd locked her door, remember? We should get back to Kelly and go to the attic like you said. - I'll grab your grandfather's gun. - I don't think that's a good idea. Dr. Harding? What are you doing here? I'm waiting for you. We need to talk. There's some things you need to hear about your grandmother. About me. About The Midnight Man. You're playing the game, aren't you? Well, that is most unfortunate. I can wait you out all night. You can't touch me. You must be punished! I see your fear now. Kelly. Kelly. Is that you? How do you know my name? You killed me. How could I forget you? You slit my throat. - You're lying. - No! Now, it's your turn to feel the blade. You're not dead yet. I'm not dead. I'm not dead. Miles! Alex! - My God! There's three of you playing? - Our friend, Kelly. We had to leave her though, but she's in the circle of protection. - Her candle went out. - That's what we were looking for. Another candle. I'm afraid, that's not how it works. Your friend is in grave danger. Wait, how do you know so much about the game? I was in the attic... ...the night that your grandmother played the game the first time. Run! I see you. She'd invited me over, but... ...then... ...she wouldn't let me play. Said it was for the big kids only. Anna was the only one that survived that night. But she still plays the game... ...over and over... ...unable to stop. She's trapped somehow... ...in the Midnight Man's clutches. She has been supplying him with players ever since. Why? I'm sorry, Alex, I... I honestly don't know. But one thing I know for certain... ...this is no game for kids or bored teenagers. The Midnight Man is utterly ruthless. He's some kind of Pagan entity. It only knows punishment. - You mean, he's an executioner? - Yes, and I fear... ...I fear it's only gonna get worse. How could this possibly get worse? The Midnight Man doesn't like to lose. What does that mean? He, uh, tends to bend the rules sometimes. You mean he cheats? Yes. And he's very, very good at it. Did you say your friend is in another room of the house? Yeah. Good. Good. Perhaps, she can keep him occupied... ...while... while we go to the attic... ...and destroy the game. We can't just leave her as bait. I'm... I'm afraid she's no longer bait. She's the appetizer. Kelly! Liar! Liar! I know your secret. I don't wanna play this game anymore. Your tears mean nothing, Kelly. Liar, liar. Where are you going, Kelly? You killed me. You can't run, Kelly, remember? Are you sad now, Kelly? - Stop it. - You murdered me. Stop it! Murderer. - No! - Now, it's your turn. Leave me alone! Shut up! I want to show you something. Your game is over. No. No! Kelly! She's gone. - Oh, shi... - Oh, my God! Taken. This is what happens when you lose the game. We have to get to the attic now. That's where you started the game, right? That's where you found the box? - Yeah. - Alright. We're running out of time here. Let's end this. Quickly now. We must finish this. Do what you need to do. - What are you doing? - I just have to know. It's true. "Annie Luster, age 30. Fear of heights." Please just d... don't hurt my daughter. Do it. - I can't. - Do it. Take your life. Father, forgive me. Look at her. Look at her! My mom didn't kill herself. She was murdered by my grandma. She tricked her into playing the game. Like you said... ...she's been supplying the Midnight Man with players knowing what could happen. And she sent me up here to get her mirror knowing I would find the box. - And she knew I would open it. - None of that matters now. You need to surround yourselves with the salt. Make a... a circle of protection. Fast! - Wait, how much time is left? - Just... just hurry. All that matters now is that you both survive. Easier said than done. Anna. Anna, no more. Please, just listen to me. This must stop now! I beg of you! Why did you do it? Why did you kill your own daughter? How could you? She was a thief and a liar and a whore! She deserved to be punished. And I got picked to punish her. Don't listen to her, Alex. That's not your grandmother anymore. What? He's here. He's using her for a conduit. Is... is the circle finished? Shit, the candles are out. Shi... There's one left. It's okay 'cause we're in the circle. We're in the circle. We're in the salt. Dr. Harding, get in the circle. No. It doesn't work for me. I... I'm not in the game. He can't hurt me. Tommy? Annie. My Annie. Dr. Harding! No! Stop! Stop it. Nana, stop! I said stop! I don't wanna hurt you. I didn't... I didn't wanna hurt you. I was just a little girl. Just like you. And my mom said that you had to die too. My mommy said that you have to die too. You have to be dead too. You have to be dead too! Be dead too! You should be fucking afraid. It's over. It's over. Is it? Not yet. The half hour mark! It's 3:30. Three more minutes. We made it. You've lost. We won. I am so sad! One. Two. Three. Four. It's 4 a.m. It's 4:00. We made it. It's over. You sacrificed yourself for us. Let's destroy this game and get out of here. The Midnight Man doesn't like to lose. Sometimes he, uh, tends to bend the rules. It's not 3:33 yet. Miles, no! No! No! There is no escape! Your tears mean nothing to me. Your game is over. - Dad? - Yeah. You knew the people that lived here? - Yes, I did. - What happened to them? Sorrow happened. - Can I have this? - Let me see. I don't see why not. Looks harmless. Cool. - Should we go? - Yeah. So what do you think is in there? I don't know. I hope it's a game. So if you really... ...go the whole way... ...and see how you feel at the prospect of vanishing forever. Have all your efforts... ...and all your achievements and all your attainments... ...turning into dust and nothingness. What is the feeling? There is no feeling.
