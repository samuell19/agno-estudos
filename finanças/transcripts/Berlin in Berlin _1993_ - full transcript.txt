whose photographs are they? hey, what is your problem? Don't you like them? I don't know what are they? Who photographed those? Who? Who photographed those? It is enough. Stop it. Go away. it is an accident. An accident. I ain't no murderer. It is an I ain't no murderer. I ain't no murderer. May I help you? Turkish or filter Filter Are you learning Turkish? Yes, can be told so. Anything else? No? okay. Yücel, where is she going? she is attending a driving school. What is that scarf on your head? I want to mention about some traffic duties and signs. We as the driving school remind you to listen to what we tell carefully and apply them when driving in Berlin and try not to drive it as in Turkey. You know signs are all same in every country. But there are some specific ones for Berlin. We will take a look at them today. For example... May I speak to you? I need to talk to you. That is enough. There is actually nothing here. It has been 3 months since the accident but you still dwell on. Now you can see yourself as a Turk. Yüksel, it is not the first time this bloke is coming here and he always takes the same seat. He looks like a Journalist. not. Let's see who he is. Let's chat some. You are studying on Turkish again? Yes. What did you order? I haven't yet but I would like a beer. Beer. I think this bloke's problem is my sister in law. Let's see what happens. Keep calm! Don't show yourself! Just stand aside. What is his problem? I got to talk to you. Please. I have to do it. It will take only a minute. What the hell is he doing? I will fuck that pimp up! Stop it. Keep calm. Let me talk to you. I am sorry for all happened to your husband. I ain't no murderer. What does he want? I want to talk to her I got it. You are the killer. You are the murderer of my brother. Yüksel, move... I will kill you. Yüksel I am leading to our street. You block him. Hey, Hey, hey help. Where did he go? : It is also closed. : Are you sure he got into our apartment? Yes. Where is that faggot? Come after me. Move. Mom, dad! Is it the skinheads again? What skinheads? The killer. I caught the killer of my brother. What killer? Wasn't it an accident? I don't know but we will ask that to my sister in law. We'll see, move down. walk. Where did this faggot go? Move, I will kill him. We lost him. Run, run, we got to find him. So hasn't he got into our apartment? Where are you bastard? I will kill you. You will see, I promise to catch him and kill him, you will see. afterwards Mehmet and the man started to argue. What problem may Mehmet have with a German? Why did they argue? I don't know they spoke in German. Why didn't you mention that to us? okay. Are you sure you don't know this man in advance? He pushed him. He pushed him and he died. That is all. What was this fag telling to you? Why the hell did he block your way? He was telling he was no murderer and begging me to forgive him. Conscience. Even unbelievers have conscience. If this was by me when I saw that bloke today he was done. you would shoot him, wouldn't you? I would carve him out. I swear I would. how fateless was my brother. He lost his life for nothing. Might he actually have killed him? what you mean actually killed him? If he says killer than he is a killer. Why don't we go to the police? don't be silly we already did. Will they believe in him or us? Idiot, you talk bullshit. This is Germany man. Yücel, Yücel, Is that you, Yücel? Yes it is me. fuck your German. Why don't you answer in Turkish? What is up with you again? I was in the beer garden with Jana. Look this is her. I was with her the whole night. She is so sweet. Who cares? He says 'Who Cares'. What is 'Who Cares'? We tell you we caught your brother's killer. We were nearly catching him. What killer? Didn't they say it was an accident? A German son of a bitch came and killed our brother. He maybe pushed him into the construction site. I don't know how the fuck he did it. Where did you learn that? The bloke came to here we passed up the opportunity. But I swear if I don't catch him and kill him don't ever call me Müfdüz. Are you telling me that my brother is murdered? We will discuss those tomorrow. I am so sleepiness. What are you hiding? I am not as dump as you believe. Do you get it? Also I love my brother more than you do. I know him better than you. My brother is not a man to argue without a base. Even with a German. My brother fights for one thing and it is chastity. Do you understand it sister in law? Chastity. You knew this man before. Didn't you? Did he molest you? Did you encourage him? What happened? He took my photos. what? Did you pose for him? What posing? He took them from distance. Son of a bitch. Mehmet gone mad when he saw the pictures. Was that the reason they fight? They didn't fight. They didn't even fight. You mean my brother died for three photos. Brother I'll trash you up. Get down fag, get down... This man is in our house. It won't befit our state to touch him in this house. What are you talking about Grandma? This man is our brother's killer. This is a test of god for us. I care no test. I'll kill this shit. Beat it. Beat it. He came to our house to claim for mercy, if he dies before he leaves that door, we will be blackened. Beat it. Leave that gun. I will kill him Bride, give him something to change his pants. customs ha? Customs. Than take him out I will kill this bastard outside the house. Sister in law, aren't they my brother's pajamas? Get out, out. Archlach, walk, walk Mürfüz, you heard what my mother said. I know father. I won't kill him in here. I am taking him out. He is our guest. If he goes out with his own will than okay but you can't force him. Let the man free. I won't see you touch him. I will kill you. Know that I will. You will get out of that door one day anyhow. Yücel: now listen to me. I don't know who you are. But if you ever go out you will be dead. You are safe in here. Did you understand? A God's guest. Thank god we have a god's guest at least. The last gift of god. We were not to touch him in this house. Man feels to rebel the god. As a custom, as a tradition we got the killer of our brother and let him sit on the first place. We are Just about to feed him. Would the guest want anything? How are your customs, dear guest? Do you offer candies to your guests? Do you pour cologne? Sorry we are out of candy what would you think of this? I will kill you. I'll destroy you. Don't be afraid, not in here. I can't kill you here because there was a tradition but I'll take you outside and kill you. you won't stay in here. You will go out. Go out, beat it! Mustafa I don't get these. Didn't we get the insurance money after our brother's dead? We did, so? what does that mean? what we do is crap bro. When we get the insurance money we accepted the accident. We sure did. We had no idea of this man on that time by courtesy of our sister in law. What does that mean? Namely, will we kill the man? What killing? Isn't there a trial or police for this? It has been long time police discarded the case. It is a cold case for a long time. Which trial, which police are you talking about? I've already lost one child of mine; do you ask me to lose you? shut up. Nuran look what we are talking on dinner. If the occasion arises we will pay their money to the last cent. Give him a plate. what do you say grandma? The man is my brother's killer. if he was in Jail wouldn't he be eating? Good night. What are you doing there Thomas? Are calling for someone? Who? Police? Why don't you call them? Call. I am Just calling a friend. He might be looking for me. okay, call him. Please go out. please go out. out. You took nice photos. Why don't you take my photos? Take mine. I haven't got my brother's revenge yet you Just fuck off this house. I will kill you. What is going on? aren't you obeyed any more in this house, Ekber? this man is a guest my house. It makes no difference whether we are in Germany. I won't let my mother's words overridden. Is he gone? he is gone hello Thomas, what is up? What a coincidence to see you here.
