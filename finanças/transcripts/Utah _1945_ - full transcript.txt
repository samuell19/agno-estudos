[MUSIC PLAYING] DOROTHY: [SINGING] Now way down upon the Swanee River folks keep jabbin' all the day long. Oh, that's where I'm gonna stay forever, where the gait will make my life a song. So honey child, on that day, when you come my way, I'll say, thank Sisty for me! -How'd it look, Stell? -Terrific, honey! If I know anything about shows, this oughta run a year, maybe two! -Gee, I hope so! I could use about a year's steady work. -Yeah, especially the salary that goes with it! It'll take just about that much to get me outta hawk. -Dorothy, What we would like to see in the office. -Thanks Bill. See ya later! -All right kids, gather round, I wanna tell you something. -Hello fellas. Bill said you wanted to see me. -Dorothy, I've got bad news for you. We're closing reversals. -Closing rehearsals? -Only temporarily, we hope. -Ralph, you can't do that. You've got a hit! This is the biggest thing you've ever done! -Yeah, honey, that's what we think. But unfortunately, our backer is pulling out on us. -Well, you can't just fold up. Get another backer! Look, I've been around show business long enough to know a hit from a turkey, and this can be a smash hit. -I'm afraid it's no use, honey. We're asking the cast to stand by for a few weeks. If a miracle should happen, we promote another bankroll. -I'm sorry boys. Say, how much of a bankroll would it take? -$20,000. $25,000, maybe. -Know where we can get it? -Maybe. Part of it anyway. -We just got the bad news. -Maybe it isn't so bad at that. Stella, give me a nickle. How would you kids like to take a trip out West? -You mean that ranch you've been talking about? -Mm-hm. Western Union, please. -Well, why go clear out there to starve to death, when we can starve right here in Chicago? -But it would be fun, cowboys and-- cowboys! -That's for me. Way out west where men are many! -Kids, I've got a hunch. And if it doesn't work out, we can stay on the ranch until the new season opens. At least we'll have enough to eat. Western Union? I want to send a telegram to Roy Rogers, Bar X Ranch, Coldbrook, Utah. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You missed me! -Oh, hello Roy. How are ya? -OK, Gabby. But I'm a little worried. I got a telegram. -Telegram? Who died? -Nobody. It's from Old Man Bryant's granddaughter. Listen. Please take inventory, Bar X. Planning immediate sale. Arrive noon train, Thursday. Signed, Dorothy Bryant. -Females! She can't sell the Bar X! First place, Old Tom'd turn over in his grave if he thought that place was gonna pass out of the family! -Yes, and he's turn over twice if they started runnin' sheep on it. -Sheep! There ain't nobody gonna run no sheep around here, as long as I got a trigger finger! Winton and his outfit's been tryin' to get their hands on the Bar X for the past 20 years. If she puts it on the market, they're sure to buy it. And you know what that'll mean. -Yeah. Sheep on our range, sure as shootin'. We gotta do somethin'. Do it quick! -Gabby, you were Pop Bryant's closest friend. And I was thinking once she gets out here, you could sort of have a talk with her and convince her. -Convince a female? Ain't nobody livin' can tell 'em nothin'. Next to a sheep, they're the dumbest critters on earth-- -Take it easy, Gabby, there's no use yelpin' like a coyote. What we've got to do is try to figure out a way to keep her from sellin'. Of course, once she sees the ranch, she might change her mind about sellin'. We could have the boys fix it up a little bit. -Fix it up a little bit? It's too durn neat and pretty as it is! -We could make it more feminine-like, more-- We'll have the boys put up some lace curtains and stuff. I'll see ya Thursday, Gabby. -Lace curtains and stuff! Darn persnickety female! Doggone termites! -Hey Kenny, gimme that brass polish, will ya? -This is the funniest hangin' I ever attended! Lace petticoats for windows! [tsks] -Snap it up, boys! That train'll be pullin' in to Coldbrook in a hour. See ya at the station, Bob. -I thought you was goin' in with us. -No, I'm goin' but and pick up Gabby. -What's on your mind, Bowman? -I want to talk to you, Rogers. -That'll have to wait. I'm on my way to meet a train. -That's just what I want to talk to you about. -Lacy, here, tells me Bryant's granddaughter wants to sell the Bar X. -Well, he oughta know. He delivered the telegram. But what's that got to do with you? -Look Rogers, I'm a real estate and cattle broker, right? And I've got a buyer. $100,000 cash. -If it's Winton you're thinkin' about, we're not interested. -Well, I've never heard that there's anything wrong with Winton's money. The girl want to sell the ranch, and Winton wants to buy it. -He's got the other side of the range to run his sheep on. We're keepin' the grass in this valley for cattle. -Say, I was just a-thinkin', that Bryant girl ain't never even seen the Bar X. Probably hasn't any idea what it's worth. -Maybe you've got somethin' there. If she needs money, she'd probably be tickled to death to give us an option to buy it for $25,000 or $30,000. We could sell it to Winton for $100,000. -No. Not after Rogers tells her how much that ranch is really worth. He's on the way to meet her now. -Suppose he never got to the station, and we did? -Do you mean what I think you mean? -Well, $70,000's a lot of dough. [GUNSHOT] -You stay here, Gabby. When I whistle, come runnin'. -Nice shootin', Lacy. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Come on, get up outta there, ya young whippersnapper! Get up! -Take it easy, Rogers! We were shootin' at a coyote! Any of those shots hit near ya, it was a mistake! -Didn't look like a mistake to me, come on. -Here's the other one, Roy. -Wait a minute, Rogers. You and Wittaker think we shot at you deliberately. We say we didn't! -What do we do with them? -We've got a train to meet. Let 'em walk back to Coldbrook. -Come on, Gabby! -Daw! -Come on! Miss Bryant? -No, but-- -I'm Miss Bryant! -Well, welcome to Utah, Miss Bryant! I'm Roy Rogers, and this is Gabby Wittaker. -Hello. -Hey. -Thanks for the nice welcome, Mr. Rogers. Makes me feel awfully important. These are my friends, Mrs. Mason, and Miss-- -Do you mean to say all them females are with you? -Yes. Do you mind? -Oh, what he means is, that, uh-- -Well, that's quite all right. You have our transportation? -Yes. I'll take your bags. -Oh! -Oh, I'm sorry. -Mr. Rogers! If you don't mind! -Well, I'm sorry. -I think you said that. -Phee-youey! What this stuff fer? -Just something to make you smell good. You should try it sometime. -Looks like we're all going to be one, big, happy family. -I reckon if Roy can stand it, you can. -We won't annoy you with our presence very long, Mr. Rogers. I'm only staying until I sell the ranch. -It'll have to be a mighty long time. Me and Roy's decided you can't sell. -Oh, you've decided? -Well, what he means is, we've been thinking it over and we've decide that-- -I'm quite capable of thinking for myself, thank you. -No female's capable of thinking for herself. -Say, what are we doing, playing straight for this old goat? -Quiet, grandma! Now listen here, young wom-- -Just a minute, Gabby. I'll talk to Miss Bryant. -That won't be necessary. If you'll just load our luggage! -I'm sorry we got off to such a bad start, Miss Bryant. I guess Gabby was a little blunt. He has a habit of saying what he thinks. -What you both think, apparently. -Well, the only reason we were hopin' you wouldn't sell the ranch is that, well, it's been in your family so long, and we thought that-- -Mr. Rogers, I appreciate your interest, but I've already made my decision. -I know but at a forced sale, you'll never get what the ranch is worth. -Then I'll take what I can get. I want the money for a better investment. -A better investment? What's a better investment than a ranch? It pays ya a good income-- -Really Mr. Rogers! I don't think this is any of-- [SIGHS] I'm invested the money in a theatrical production. -Investing? You're gambling away your ranch you haven't even seen yet. I guess there's nothing like a-- -That's right! [SIGHS] -Well, that's funny we're not out of gas. -Even out here it happens. -What's a matter, Roy? -I think it's the carburetor. Yep, it's the carburetor, all right! Gabby, we'll have to ride back to the ranch and get another one. Boys, you stay here. We'll be back in about an hour. If the girls ask you anything about the ranch-- how big it is, or how much it's worth-- don't answer. Just sing, and keep singin'. I'm sorry folks, but we'll be back as soon as we can. -Does it take two of you to carry a carburetor? -Well, you see, one of us might not know where it is. -Well, you might as well tie your horses up, boys. -What are you up to, son? -I've got to brainstorm, Gabby. -Oh, I know that! But what are you up to? -[CHUCKLES] Come on. -Look Roy, what're ya tryin' to fool her fer? Just tell her if she sells the Bar X, the whole dern valley'd be overrun with sheep. That wouldn't mean a thing to her. She's city-breed. -She's a female, ain't she? City-bred or country-bred, they're all alike. Take her over your knee! -I've got a picture of me takin' her over my knee. She's got spirit. You can't out fight her, you've got to out smart her. -Out smart her? They're all dumber'n sheep! Dern persnickety females! If I had my way-- -But you haven't! Come on. This'll be a good place for it, Gabby. Hurry up, Gabby! -Howdy, Miss Bryant! [GAGS] [COWBOYS SINGING] -That's very nice boys, but would you mind telling me what-- [COWBOYS SINGING] -Hey, where are we goin'? -The Bar X, of course! -Well, the Bar X is that a-way! -No, it ain't. It's that a-way. Can't ya read? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Welcome home, Miss Bryant. -Home! This? This is awful! -Well, it is a little run down. I guess I oughta slicked it up a little bit for ya. -But I thought-- -Hey boys, rustle the ladies' luggage, will ya? Now would you like to see the inside? -Oh! Well, it really isn't much, but we call it home. -Yeah, pull up a window and sit down. --[CHUCKLES] It is a little untidy, but, uh-- -Untidy! Why, it's filthy! Is this all there is to the place? -Well, sure. -Do you mean all of you live in this shack? -Well, the boys don't work here, they're from the-- from another ranch-- just neighbors. -Them overalls supposed to hang right there. -Hang? They can stand by themselves. I need some air. -Gee, I'm sorry you don't like the place, Miss Bryant. -How big is this place? -Oh, 40 or 50 acres I should say. Course, all of it isn't good land. The stocks all right, though. We've got some good cattle and some pigs. Would you like to see 'em? -No, thank you. What I don't understand is how this place has been able to support itself, much less pay me an income of $200 a month! -Well, that's why it's rundown. Of course, now, if we could have been puttin' that money we've been sendin' back to you back into the ranch-- -Never mind our luggage, boys, we aren't staying. -Not stayin'? Well, I thought you came out here to sell? -Sell! This place? [SCOFFS] I doubt if I could give it away. We're taking the first train out. -Now you're talking! That's the most sensible remark I ever heard from a female. -Oh, I'm sorry you're disappointed, Miss Bryant. -Next train leaves at 20 minutes to 11:00 tonight. -Well, I guess we'll just have to wait here until train time. You might as well load our baggage in the station wagon. -Oh, but the station wagon doesn't belong to this ranch. -It doesn't belong here? But I though you-- -No, it belongs to the ranch where the boys work. But, uh, I think I can borrow it to take you back to the station, that is if you're set on leavin'. -Well, we're set! -You can say that again! I just assume live in a buzzard's nest. -Well, that'll suit you just fine. -Better be ready about 10 o'clock. Mount up, boys! Come on, Gabby. Well, good evenin'. Aren't you folks ready? -We're not going. -Not goin'? -Miss Bryant has decided to stay. -Now, you look here! -Could I speak to Miss Bryant, please? -Well, just a minute. -Gee, I hadn't figured on this, I think-- -Yes? -Uh, you've, uh, you've decided to stay? -Yes, we have. I'm going to st-- [COYOTE HOWLS] -Wh-- What was that? -A coyote. If you're figurin' on stayin' the night, Miss Bryant, maybe you'd better take this. -Why should we need that? -Wild animals. Why, only last night, a fella got clawed to pieces in his sleep. Then, of course, they's the rattlesnakes. -If you think you can frighten us with a corny gag like that, you're crazy. -Females! You ain't got brains enough to be scared. Why, I remember once-- -Don't you think that maybe-- -Maybe you girls'd feel better if we brought our blankets and slept out here tonight. -Thank you. I don't think that will be necessary. -All right, but if you change your mind, just holler. Good night. -Good night. -Females! -Since when did Gabby's place get to be the Bar X? -I don't know. -Maybe we can find out. -Good morning. You Miss Bryant? -Yes. -My name is Bowman. I was a good friend of your grandfather's. This is Steve Lacy. -Hello. -Howdy. -I understand you're anxious to sell the Bar X. -I certainly am. At least I was until I saw it. I don't think this place is worth very much. -Hasn't your foreman given you an estimate? -No, he hasn't. As a matter of fact, Rogers seems very anxious to prevent me from selling this place at all. -Well, I happen to be in the cattle and real estate business. If you'd like to drop in at the office tomorrow, maybe we can make a deal. -I certainly will. I'll try and get in this afternoon. -Oh, that's fine. Oh, I wouldn't say anything to Rogers about this. Naturally, he'd try to prevent a sale to protect his job. -I wouldn't be surprised. -Well, see ya this afternoon. -Bye. And thank you! Hold everything, kids, we're leaving! -What? -I got a customer for the ranch! We're selling out! -Oh, look, how about making up your mind? We're going, we're staying, we're staying, we're going! -I was just commenting to like the place. -Are you kiddin'? -Good morning! -Morning. -Hello, Miss Wanda. -Hi, Cowboy! -Can I, uh, help ya with that? -You sure can! -Oh, good morning. -Morning. -Won't you come in? -Thanks. -Well, of all the dad-blamed! Look what they done to the place! -Well, you sure fixed it up nice, Miss Bryant. -You really like it? -Like it? Why it-- -Sure, we like it. It-- It's swell. -Flowers. Flowers is for funerals, not for a house! And look at the petticoats on them windows! This here's a ranch, ain't no lady's [INAUDIBLE]! Where's my Sunday overalls? They couldn't a walked away! -I'm not so sure about that! -If you wasn't a female, and was closer to my age-- -Nobody could be that close, and live! -Quiet grandma! -Gabby! [CHUCKLES] Sort of loses his temper sometimes. Well, Miss Bryant, where should we move the yearlings in the south pasture? -Well, It really doesn't matter. I wonder if I could borrow the station wagon this afternoon? I have to go into town. -To town? What for? Well, what I mean is, if you really need something in town, Gabby and I will be glad to pick it up for you. -Well, no. You see, this is something I can take care of, personally. -Well, I'm sorry, Miss Bryant, but that carburetor is-- -It's on the blink again? -Well, sort ot. Come on, Gabby. We'll see ya later, Miss Bryant. Well, where do you think you're goin' all dressed up. -Tack room. Need a couple saddles. -Couple saddles? What for? -Well, got a date with Miss Wanda. -Well, I'll tell her you'll be a little late. I've got a job for you and the boys. -OK, I'll tell-- me? And what job? -Gabby'll tell ya all about it. So long. -What time is it Stella? -4 o'clock, straight up. -Oh gee, I'm supposed to be there at 4:00. -Be where? Isn't he going to pick you up? -No, I'm going to meet him at the Loveseat. Romantic, huh? -[CHUCKLES] I suppose so. -That's my date. Thanks honey, you're a doll. -Madam. -Bye all you lonesome people, don't wait up for me. -Oh hello. -Hello. -I thought you were Robert. -I'm afraid Robert will be a little bit late. -That's peachy. -Well, hello, Miss Bryant. -Hello. -I'm sorry about the station wagon. I brought you a horse, thought. Thought maybe you could ride him until we get the motor fixed. -Well, thank you. -Maybe you'd like to take a look at him and sort of get acquainted. -All right. -His name's Billy. You don't have to be afraid of him, he's gentle as a cow. -Oh, he's beautiful. -Think you can handle him all right? -I can if he knows what, "whoa" means. [CHUCKLING] -Well, uh, would you like to try him out now? -Sure, why not? -Swell. I'll help you on. -Whoa! [CHUCKLES] It worked! -It's beautiful. -It took a lot of fight to make that valley beautiful, Miss Bryant. The first people in there cleared it with their bare hands. They came over Green Horse Mountain, yonder, in covered wagons. A lot of 'em died in the snow. -I remember hearing my granddad talk about that when he came east one time. I was just a kid. Did you know my granddad, Roy? -Yes, I knew him. My grandfather came over that trail with him. They settled this section together. -Those old pioneers certainly went through a lot of hardships. -Yeah, but if you loved the land like they did, I guess hardships don't matter much. They were building for the future, not thinking so much about themselves. -[SIGHS] I suppose so. -Gosh, I'm awful sorry I'm late, Miss Wanda. -Of all the dirty, lowdown tricks, standing me up. And on my last night here. -Doggone it, I just couldn't help it. I was doin' somethin' for Roy. -Yeah, what? -Well-- I can't tell you that. And besides, I don't think this is your last night here. I think you're stayin'. -Staying? What are you talking about? -Well-- That's all I can say. I can't tell you any more than that. -Want a bet? -Hey! What's the idea? -Oh, Wanda, it's the middle of the night! -Brother, have I got news! We're staying here. -What? -Oh, this is where I came in. -But Dorothy said that when we're leaving that she was selling the ranch tomorrow. -But that was before that cowboy Casanova took her for a ride in the moonlight. -Roy, perhaps I've been wrong. -Wrong? -Yeah. About a lot of things. -Just what do you mean? -What I mean is that-- I think maybe I really do belong out here. -Well, I'm sure glad to hear you say that Dorothy, because, well, there's something I have to tell ya. If you don't mind though, I'd like to keep it 'til tomorrow. It's a sort of a surprise. -Surprise? -Mm-hm. Will you and the girls hold tomorrow afternoon open? -Sure. -Well, good. Gabby'll pick you up in the station wagon about 3 o'clock. -We'll be waiting. -OK. Now don't forget it. 3 o'clock. -I won't. Good night. -Good night. WANDA: I'll bet that guy could peddle ice cubes at the North Pole. Do you know what he did? He even arranged a musical background for the moonlight and roses theme. And Bob told me that when Roy sells them, they stay sold. -You mean to say Dorothy fell for a corny gag by a yokel cowpoke? --[SCOFFS] I hope I don't look that simple. I just rode along for the laughs. -Ah gee, Dorothy, I-- I didn't know you were outside. -Don't be silly, Wanda, you weren't telling me anything I didn't already know. I just wanted to talk him out of a horse. After all, I did have to go in town to make a deal for the ranch, didn't I? -Here's the Bill of Sale, Miss Bryant. You'll find things as we agreed. The Bar X Ranch, together with all equipment and livestock. $5,000. $1,000 now, the balance within 30 days through your own bank in Chicago. -Looks all right to me. -It's perfectly legal. Just sign here. -Yes. There you are. -Thank you. My check for $1000. Well, that closes the deal. Satisfactory? -Very. To be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Bowman, I didn't expect that much. Good bye, Mr. Bowman. Thank you very much. -Good bye. She thanks me. -Not a bad morning's work. I hope there's no kickback on it. -How can there be? I've got her signature. The deal is closed, legally. -Sure, but you're forgettin' somethin', ain't ya? You just gave her one of those checks of yours, and you've still got to raise another $4,000. -This deal'll be closed before that check clears. With all those Bar X cattle, you don't think I'm gonna have any trouble raising $5,000, do ya? Plus a neat little profit for myself. -Don't put 'em there, Bob. That space is for the turkey. Hurry it up, fellas, they oughta be here any minute. Light those candles, Tim. -Whoever heard of candles in broad daylight? -Well, you always have candles at a party! You fellas all know what to do? -By goodness, we oughta! You've only told us ten times already. -Hey, it's after 3 o'clock, maybe that station wagon really did breakdown. -Or Gabby broke down. [CAR PULLS UP] -Here they come, boys! Get your positions, and let's have the music! [MUSIC PLAYING] [COWBOYS SINGING] I'm going to hide away out beside that Utah trail. Moonlight as bright as day far out on that Utah trail. There's where I'll settle down in peach where all is still. In a little hut, just built for two, tucked away in the heart of the hills. There 'neath the skies of blue-- -Well, where are the girls? -Gone. Skipped out. Vamoosed. Bag and baggage. [SNIFFS] Left this on the door for you. --[READING] Thanks for the ride in the moonlight. Utah's a fine place, but so is Chicago, and that's where we've gone. Dorothy Bryant. -Well, maybe it's not too late to stop 'em. -Stop 'em? What fer? This is what you wanted isn't it? -Well, not just like this. -Hey, what's eatin' you, anyhow? The whole idea was to get that female back east before she could sell the Bar X. So it worked. So everything is Jake. So let's eat. -Well, I can't figure this out. Last night she-- she was all set to stay. -Good riddance, what I say. Now we really got an excuse to throw a party. Come on, boys, strike up the music! -I-- I guess that means Miss Wanda left too, huh? -Hey, what is this, a funeral? -Roy! Roy, there's a bunch of fellars on the south range. They're roundin' up our cattle. -Well, who are they? -I don't know. But Ben Bowman's with 'em. -Looks like trouble, boys. You better put on your guns. -Where's my gun? Where's my gun? -[INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, that's my horse, Gabby! -Outta my way, Bob, I got work to do. -Are you with that cattle drive? -That's right, why? -Then maybe you can't read brands. Can't you see that that's Bar X stock? -Maybe you can't read a Bill of Sale. I happen to own the Bar X. -You'll never make that stick, Bowman. -No? I'm takin' the cattle. -But, not far. -Take it easy, Rogers. -We're within our rights here, but Rogers might cause trouble. I'm gonna get the Sheriff, Steve. -Might as well step down and take it easy. -You haven't got one chance in a million of gettin' away with this, Lacy. -One chance in two million! Drop that gun, you wall-eyed polecat! Nice work, son. Couldn't have done better, myself. -Thanks. Rustlers! Let's go get 'em. All right, boys, this is as far as you go. -We might have at least said good bye to the boys. -You mean the boys named Bob? Forget it, you'll meet four other Bobs 'fore we get home. -You know, I hate to leave. The mountains, the trees, the moonlight. You can say what you want about the Bar X, they don't have air like this in Chicago. -Ever passed the stock yards on a windy day? -Miss Bryant? -Yes? -I'm Sheriff McBride. McBride. -Yes, sir? -This Bill of Sale, it seems, uh, Roy Rogers questions it. -I don't see what right he has to question what doesn't concern him, Sheriff. -Then you did sell the Bar X, and all the cattle on it? -I certainly did. -Thanks, Miss Bryant. -Not at all. -Well, girls, it's farewell to Utah. Let's go. -What's goin' on here, Roy? -We're roundin' up a bunch of rustlers. -You're wrong, Roy. -These men have a perfect right to move the Bar X stock. They work for Bowman, here. Bowman bought the ranch. -Bought it? That's a laugh. -I just talked to Miss Bryant, myself. She acknowledged the sale. -She-- that was fraud. She didn't know what she was doing. -It ain't fraud when Bowman's got a Bill of Sale. And she was in the right mind when I talked to her. -Look, Sheriff, you're not going to let Rogers-- -I tell ya, she thought she was sellin' Gabby's place. She thought it was the Bar X. Don't you see, Sheriff? -I'm afraid I don't. -I do. He's stallin' for time. We've got a sale for these cattle, and if we don't get them out of here right away-- -If there's any dispute, Miss Bryant'll have to take it to court. You'll have to let these men pick the stock, Roy. And I don't want any trouble. Sheriff I want to report charges against Rogers for assault with a deadly weapon. -Is this a deadly weapon? -I'm sorry, but you asked for it, Roy. -So, like I always said, mixed up with females, and you end up in trouble. There we was, sittin' back, mindin' our own business, when along comes them women. -We couldn't very well sit back and watch Miss Bryant lose her ranch, could we? To say nothing but seein' the range overrun with sheep. -Well, looks like both them things gonna happen now. I tell ya, Roy, there's ain't no-- -What's up, Bob? -They're shippin' the Bar X cattle to Chicago. Me and the boys were down by the pens, and they're loadin' 'em in the cars right now. -Once they get that stock away from here, you'll never get it back. -Where's Bowman and Lacy? -They took the passenger train to Chicago. -Eh, that means they're takin' them to the stock yards. They're sellin' the cattle. -We've gotta get a hold of 'em before they make a sale. -But how? -You couldn't catch up to 'em now, even if you was out of there, which you ain't. -Oh, we're gonna be on that cattle train when they meet it in Chicago. As for gettin' out of here-- You and the boys get our horses and bring them around here. We'll meet ya in about five minutes. Hey Sheriff! -What do you want? -Would you come here a minute? I got somethin' I want to tell ya. -What's on your mind? Oh, oh! Get me off a this thing, will ya? Hurry up! Turn off that current! Ow! -Let me do it, Gabby. I got gloves. -Will you turn off that current, Rogers? You think you can put anything over on me! Turn off that current! If you think you can get away with this, Rogers, you're crazy! Turn off that switch, will ya? Get me off a this thing, Rogers! Help! Get me outta here, somebody! Hurry up! -We have some horses we want you to ship to Chicago, have you got an empty car? -Yeah, next car is empty. But you'll have to hurry. We're due out of here, right now. -Fine. All right, boys, put 'em in the next car. -You'll have to fill this out. One of you goin' along to take care of them? -We're all goin'. -OK, Roy. -There ya are, conductor. Thanks a lot. -OK, my boy. -Let her roll! -Hey, Roy! You're under arrest, Rogers. -It'll be a pleasure to do business with ya, Sheriff, after we get back from Chicago. [LAUGHTER] -Come on, boys. -Well, they pulled the cattle cars out on us. Hey brakeman, where's the rest of the train? -We pulled the cattle cars over to the west end of the yards. -Thanks. Hurry up, fellas, we've gotta get to the west side of the yard, and fast! -The count checks, Harry. -There you are, Mr. Bowman. -Thank you. -What are they doing in Chicago? -Let's get out of here. -I'll take a little. -All right. [WHISTLES] -[YELLS] [YELLS] ROY ROGERS: Whoa, Trigger! Whoa, Trigger. Whoa. Take care of him, Gabby. -Wonder where they're goin' in such a hurry? -We'll find out. -What's going on here? -We just picked up a couple of cattle thieves for ya. -Cattle thieves? These men just tried to rob us. They're tryin' to put over a fast one, Officer. -I think you're all tryin' to put over a fast one. Let's talk this over at headquarters. -They're both in my office now, Sheriff. Yes, I certainly will. You can count on that. Yes, right here. Just a moment. Oh, Rogers? He wants to talk to you. -Thanks. Yeah, Sheriff? -Well, Roy, you sure put the right tag on Bowman and Lacy. It was a fraud, all right. And to cinch it, that $1,000 check of Bowman's might just as well have been Confederate money. I just talked to Bryant's girl by long distance phone. -You did? Well, have you got her address here in Chicago? OK, Sheriff. What? -I've still got a little matter of jail-breakin' to settle with you. Funny thing about that, the doctor said that electric shock cured my arthritis. -Well, maybe I oughta send you a bill for medical services. Well, thanks a lot, Sheriff. So long. -I'm holding you men for the Utah authorities. -Why, this whole thing's a mistake. We were sort of acting for Miss Bryant in the sale of the cattle, that's all. We always intended to give her the money. -Well, in that case, maybe you'd better endorse this check over to her. -I'd be glad to. -Think you'd better take charge of this, Mr. Rogers. -Thanks. I hope it's better than Bowman's. Well, I guess I'll be runnin' along. I've got a date to explain a few things to a young lady. -Mayor, we won't take up any more of your time. -There just a minute. That's what you think. I'm still holding you for the Utah Sheriff. Take 'em downstairs, Bill. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Howdy, Miss Karen, welcome to the foray. -[INAUDIBLE] -Let me have your-- -Hold it! Look, kids, you're not giving me what I want at all! You haven't got the spirit of this thing. This is supposed to be the west, Utah! -Well, I don't know anything about shows Dorothy, but this one looks like you've made a good investment. I only wish we had Dorothy playing the lead. --[CHUCKLES] I'm afraid that's out, Ralph. I'm a-headin' for Utah. [CHUCKLES] And this time I hope I get on the right ranch. -You will. Roy and Dorothy oughta play that scene right good! -What do you know about scenes, you old goat? -Ah, quiet, grandma! -Now, you're not just an ordinary cowboy. And you, Miss Harris, you're a girl from the east who's inherited this ranch. It's a very simple matter. Oh, kids, will you come up here, please? No, no, I want the rest of you, too. Maybe Roy and Dorothy can show you what I mean. --[CHUCKLES] We should be able to. Come on, Roy. [MUSIC PLAYING] --[SINGING] If there's a place more beautiful to view, more wonderful than Utah, I can't believe it's true. ROY [SINGING] Beside a friendly campfire, beneath that Western moon, --[SINGING] we'll sing a cowboy song with our hearts in tune. Right from the start, no other place would do. We had to come to Utah to make our dreams come true. MAN: Sheep! Sheep! Sheep! Sheep! [COWBOYS SINGING] -Say, who is this guy you got herdin' our sheep today? -Just look this way. -Gad! Even got me herdin' sheep now. I'm so mad that I could pop! I'm a whiskered little Bo Peep now! Get a long there, ya lamb chop! [MUSIC PLAYING] -La, la, la. -La, la, la. -La, la, la. -La, la, la. -Utah. La, la, la, la. No other place will do. You will fall in love with Utah and Utah will love you!
