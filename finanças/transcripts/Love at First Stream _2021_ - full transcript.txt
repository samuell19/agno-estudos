Vilma! Vilma! How many times do I have to call you for breakfast? You always make the food wait! Vilma! - Let me help you. - Your stomach is so big. This is just my chest relaxing. Megu! - Auntie? - That's enough! Okay, Auntie. Get the rice. Finally! We can eat now! Try on your next vlog, "How to be Late" since you're an expert on that! Vlog vlog? Here... blag! I told her to stop those already! But Ma, is she going to? So V, are you quitting or what? Oh my God! Are those tears? Those tears won't work on me, Vilma! Reserve them for when I throw away your ring lights and cameras. Ma. V? There's pee on that! Don't put it beside the food! She's pregnant. - What? How? - She's pregnant. You spend all day online. You don't even have a boyfriend! Can the internet impregnate you now?! V, you're ruining your life! You already dropped out of school and now you're pregnant?! If Papa were still alive, he would've sobbed in disappointment. My God, V! What were you thinking? Ma? It's a prank! We're live right now! It's Rica who's pregnant! I'm going to be a father? - Ma! - Auntie? Auntie! Megu! What? V, this is your fault! - Ma... - Ma, wake up! Ma? You're okay, right? It's a prank too! For the vlog! No one cares about your vlog! For my V-log, Ma! Get this, too! No! No, no, no! No, Meg! This is your fault! You're so stupid! V, I'm sorry! What can I do to make it up to you? Why did I forget to turn off the live? So stupid! Really stupid! Meg. Hurry! Ready? Rolling. I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake. And I hate myself for hurting or offending anyone. Especially my mom. Oh my gosh, V! You're making me cry. I told you I'm hormonal. Sorry. Bro, how many views and likes do I have now? You have 1000 views and 600 likes. 1000 views! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! How much will you get for a thousand views? If I get more views by the end of the month, roughly around six thousand pesos... or more! Wow! We're done! Thank you! Okay, fans! Gotta bounce! Vilma! There's still a pandemic! I'll just shoot something, Ma. Did you get any buyers for the pork sausage? I told you to post that a long time ago! But did she, Ma? Good morning, class! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. - This is such an exciting day... - I've gone viral. - For your internship! - I've gone viral! - Exciting times! - I've gone viral! - Ouch! - Sorry, sorry! Guys, stop laughing at Megumi. I feel sorry... for the helmet. And look! I didn't think Megumi's eyes could still get smaller. The tension is real, guys! - Gino is so annoying! - Our top two candidates... - Maybe he likes you. - For the Singapore internship. I chose the two of you since you debate every day anyway. So now you can debate for real. Slowly! Slowly! Stop! Good morning! Good morning! I have a new upload on my V-log. Already liked it, V-eautiful! Please like, follow, and subscribe my v-log: V_rami! You could run for town captain too! She's just like her father! Of course! Hi! It's your girl V and I will tour you again at my future home! Let's go! Let's follow protocols. Are you excited? Not so fast! Someone already bought the unit you wanted. You snooze you lose! It's your girl V in her most haggard look! Please follow, like, and subscribe! And comment down below! - Jopet! Delete that! - Haggard! - Give me that! - No way! I want a viral video, too! Jopet, delete that! You'll never be famous because I'll kill you before that happens! - Guys, look! - Jopet! This is her in her rarest form. So disgusting! Look at her, guys! Go sweat some more! There's your house! Go home! - I will never delete this! - Give me that! - Haggard! - Jopet! This is mine now! Give that back, Jopet! Fine! Here! Ow. Magical! So magical! They don't look good together. Are you blind? V and Tupe's chemistry is undeniable. Vilma? Miss, your helmet. V, is Tupe your ex? No! Chill. He's her almost. But after prom, Tupe hated her guts. Cousin, it doesn't look like Tupe hates her. So, what happened at the prom? Prom? Here! - Prom the printer! - It's here! V! You'll be famous now! Ta-da! Thanks to Mama! - No! - So dramatic! Don't you like it? Isn't it your dream to endorse a brand? Here it is. In my vlogs, Ma. Not for your sausages. Don't touch this! I told you V, vlogging will get you nowhere. But this? This? This will take you somewhere because this is a legit business! My vlogs are legit too, Ma! People know me now. I'm getting a lot of likes! "Likes"? "Likes"? You're obsessed with likes! Better than obsessing over sausages! Ma! V, we like you! That's what matters more, right? Online likes are different. If you don't get likes, you don't really matter. Exactly. What kind of twisted thinking is that? Ma, I work hard for my views and likes. We've seen so many go down that path, but they all lose in the end. Because stars lose their shine in the end. I'm not even a star yet and you're already so negative. Ma, don't you want me to succeed? Why don't you go back to school? You'll succeed then! Be like Megumi! She has an internship abroad. Or go look for a real job! This is a real job, Ma! There are successful people who didn't finish school. My God, V! That's one in a million! What if I'm one in a million? What if you're not? What then? Vilma, as long as you're under my roof, you follow my rules. If you don't like it, the door is open. Did you hear that, Pa? She never supports me and now she's telling me to leave. If they don't appreciate me, then goodbye! You left me all alone. You passed too soon. I lost my human shield against Mama. V, Pa, say hi! Hi! Look, guys! My darling V can climb a tree! That's my baby! Go, V! Go, V! Vilma! Get down from there! If you fall down, I swear to God I'll kill you! Ignore your mother. Go on. Just a little more. Why don't you just use a hook? It's easier. No! I want to reach it. V! Rosario! Rosario! V? Are you okay? I swear I'll find a condo and I'll buy it! I'll own it. That'll show my mother! If you need me, I'm just here. Okay? As you should! Does that mean I can sleepover there? Of course! 1k a night. How pricey! That's the cousin rate. You're the best! I am. You're on Kumu again? Barely anyone watches you. Right? Well, it's just fun to stream. You don't even earn from that. It's because I'm not a real streamer. It's just fun to chat with people. Just chilling. Excuses. You just want to talk to your Cat Boy. It's been months. You're so into him, you don't even know what he looks like! Looks don't always matter. Right? Of course, it matters! Shhh! I'm going live! Hi, Meowers! Hi! Wow! You're early again today, Cat Boy. Who knows? Your Cat Boy is in fact a CatFish. Cat Boy? Fish! Meg! Meg, wake up! - Wake up! - Fish! What fish? There's no fish! My video with Tupe is now viral! I already have 5,000 views! 5,000 views! You should do a follow up video with Tupe! With five thousand views, I can get a thousand pesos. What if I do it weekly? Or daily? Ka-ching! Ka-ching! But will Tupe agree to vlog? Where are you going? For the condo, I'd beg Tupe if I have to. So I can save up and escape my basher mom. Anybody home? Yes? My love, the laundry! Oh no! - It's raining! Twins! - Let me help! - Faster! - Come here! Get the clothes! Quickly! Does Tupe live here? Vilma? OMG! Do you watch my V-logs? No. But I remember you. Because you're the girl who broke my son's heart back in high school. My love... But I'm not mad. Just stating the facts. Well, I have a welcome gift for Tupe. And for all of you too. What's this? Thank you. Just ignore the logo. It's embarrassing. I bet Tupe would even have this framed! You look pretty here. Where is Tupe? He won't be home for awhile. He's at the condo unit we're selling. If you want, you can just go there. Yes, here's the address. Here you go. Thank you. - Thanks for this. - Thank you. Let's go in, my love. This looks delicious. Hi, guys! This is just a QLS. Because I'm super busy. I have yet to finish my essay. After this, I still have a class. And then I have to finish my internship proposal. So why are you still streaming? Why am I streaming? You're waiting for someone? Yihee! No. My priority is my studies. What would my aunt say if I focused on other things? She adopted and raised me. Whatever. Can relate. Hey, Cat Boy! I owe my parents a lot, too. We're the same. By the way, I dreamt of you, Cat Boy. Your back was facing me so I called you. Then you turned around... And your face... was that of a fish. Lol! - In can or fried? - Why don't you join the stream? Show your face! Not now. Next time! It's always "next time" with you. Anyway, I have to go. I have class. Bye, guys! Cat Boy, you're saved by the bell! Hi, Tupe. I asked Aunt Nora where you were. So you do remember me? Seems like you had amnesia yesterday. This place is great. So beautiful! Is this for rent or for sale? We're helping my uncle sell this. We'd get a commission. Serendipity! I'm looking for a condo. I'll buy this. How much is it? 4.5M. 675k down payment. Slightly negotiable. Wait why are you here? Shh! I'm still computing! Can you compute outside instead? I have to leave. I still have a job interview. Interview? Ditch that! I have an offer. You will earn and I will earn. And then I'll be able to buy this unit. What scam is this? Been there. Won't fall for it anymore. You were scammed? By you. What? I never lead you on. First, you made me believe that we were real friends. We were friends! We always hung out at the library. Because you didn't want your "cool" friends to see us! No, because we study there! I was your math tutor. Yes! But instead of tutoring me, you'd just cry about your cheating ex! Get your facts straight! "Why did he leave me for her, even though I'm prettier? What about prom?!" So how did I lead you on? Didn't I ask you, "What if we go to prom together instead?" We even practiced the dance! But it was all a scam. And that's the story of how you led me on. You asked me to prom, but did I say yes? We practiced the dance! Wasn't that a "yes"? No. It wasn't a formal proposal! Was that really necessary? Yes! It wasn't clear, so there was no "scam" that happened. You and your excuses. Then again, you wouldn't have won prom queen if you went with me. So maybe now you get why I can't trust you again, right? I promise you this vlog is legit! This is legit. Grades and your internship are at stake here. Okay, representing South Korea, our first pair, Gino and Megumi! I object! Sir. I mean, I don't want to. Why not? You don't like South Korea? No. I don't like you. Maybe you're just scared that you can't keep up with me as your partner. I'm scared I'd get infected by your arrogance. Oh come on now! You are both running for magna cum laude. You both have something to offer. No, thanks. I don't want to be fooled again. Hey, I messaged you then but you didn't reply. Just so you can dump me? Did you ever court me? Had I courted you, would you have said yes? But that's beside the point. My point is I don't want to lose this opportunity just because I'm partnered with Mr. Gino Bautista. Sir, isn't the point of the UN to maintain peace in the world? Perhaps Ms. Megumi Sakai isn't aware of that. Sir, some people might not be aware that conflicts are inevitable especially when there's a rich history of war in the past. Past is past! This is real work, I'm not here to play. I have big dreams! I do too! I have a family to feed. You already have kids? I meant my parents and my siblings. That's why I'm doing multiple jobs. I even deliver part-time. That's why I'm offering you this! We'll both earn here. What is it anyway? We'll vlog together. Together? We're like North and South Korea. So are you saying that the UN is pointless since it's impossible for countries to be at peace and we should just all go to war? I'm saying it's hard to achieve peace when other people are bullies! It's harder to achieve peace when people are so closed-minded! That is the energy! That is the chemistry that I want! Use that fire against your competitors. That is our common goal! My goal is 1M views! I don't want to be famous. Well, you're already viral! The two of us. I don't know anything about that, V. Leave it up to me! We'll split the money, 70-30. I'll have money for the down payment and you'll get a commission too. It's a win-win! Can we please be professional here? Mr. Bautista? Ms. Sakai? Please, Tupe? Please? - Fine. - All right. Yes. So, what will we do in your vlogs? I don't wanna bite more than I can chew. Leave it to me. It's so spicy! It isn't. It's so spicy! Not really. Cut, cut! Tupe, it is spicy. You really find this spicy? No. Then why say it is? That's what you call acting. Acting. Duds... Bot... Take two. Again, guys, me and Tupe followed the protocols and we're both negative. Tupe, are you ready for level two? - Yes! - Yes, guys! Oh my gosh! Look how red it is! This is gonna be hot! Can I do this? - So spicy! - So spicy. So spicy. Sell it more... Really spicy! Crazy! Pa, taste this! It's so hot! Come on. Try it. This is Tupe's dad, Uncle Pip. - It's so spicy! - I told you! That's my dad! - Is it spicy? - Nope. So, let's go to level three! No, I'm done. - What? - I'm done. No, you want more. I'm so full. Look at my tummy. It's going to burst. Cut! Cut! Cut! One more take. The card is out of memory. Fine. I'm out of patience too. Uncle, Auntie, I'll go ahead. I'll just get my stuff later, okay? Tsk tsk! Oops! Someone's falling again! - Son, are you... - Ma. Pa. I won't fall for her again. I've learned my lesson. Why are you staring then? Mommy! Just stating facts. Tupe can't act to save his life! It's cute though. Who's cute? Me? No. Tupe. Meg... - But I'm cuter, right? - Should I post this? Yeah. I knew it! Shut up! Op! Op! Op! Okay. Sorry. Let's do DIY costumes so it'll be cheaper. I can just buy some. No need. I'll pay for the costumes. I don't want to owe you anything. So proud! Meg. I'm posting it. I hope I get lots of views and likes. Universe, take the wheel. Come on! Come on! Ma, our internet is so slow! Bro, can you play later instead? Yes, boss. Is that your new vlog with Tupe? Yup. Yikes! It didn't even reach six hundred views. I told you! Stars lose their shine in the end. Right, Megu? But I uploaded this during prime time! 600 viewers? It's so hard to earn money! Vilma, if you help with our business, you wouldn't be stressed out about that. Our sausage business is what paid for your school! Okay, Ma. How much do you earn per month? Let's say thirty-five thousand times twelve. 420k per year. But here, I can earn that in a month. Why are you so keen on earning money? You don't have anyone to feed. You don't pay for the electricity or internet. What do you need money for? For your silly vlogs? I don't even buy new equipment. As you should! Don't prioritize useless things. Be like your cousin! Make her your daughter then. I'll go ahead. Are you not scared of COVID? I'll just be next door. If only I could help all the people around me, I would. I feel sad when I can't do anything for them. Don't be sad. How can I help? Uhmm... Lend me money. - Ha ha ha. - I'm kidding! I have an idea. Join a dating game? Dating game? How does that fix any of my problems? And why would I want to date someone I don't even know? Ouch! Fine. Be with AnnoyGin! You're a killjoy. Joke! There's a cash prize. Might be nice. Cash prize? Yep, it might help. What's the problem? A lot of things. Then let's solve them one by one. What's the first one? This. Oh my God. This is easy! Ta-da! Wow! You have talent! What if we do DIY vlogs? Game! Anything else? Do you need a back scratcher? Do you need a straw? There you are! That's the V I know. So sweet! Hey! Long time no see, Cat girl! Cat girl? Weren't you a cat lover back in high school? Oh. Anyway, V, I have good news! Kumu! This is about making money! Come here. So... let's resume later at eight? Dating game?! This is different from the streams I do. Yeah, you don't even earn there. But these streamers they earn big time! Love_Guro is a professional streamer. Let me show you. And these streamers, they're the top earners. Let's check this one out. According to Harmony... Wow! She's going strong! Drop her a halo-halo. Huh?! These are the virtual gifts that you can give. VG for short. Give her one already. - This one? - Yes! Hello, meowmeowmegumi. Welcome to the stream. Now, we're talking about... Not that! It didn't work? Because that one's expensive! I told you to just give a halo-halo. Just get more coins. You use real money to buy coins. Really? Yes. That's how the streamers earn. The coins that viewers gift you can be converted to dias, short for diamonds. Which you can convert to real money. Let's check the other ones out. - What about this one? - Okay. Look how many viewers she has! So much diamonds! Ka-ching! Ka-ching! Welcome, Kumunizens, to the much-awaited Love on Live dating game! Why don't we shout out to our viewers... Girls? Hi, everyone! I'm Bea. Pansexual. Aspiring singer and songwriter ooh yeah! Hello, everybody! My name is Issa Andrada. That's I-S-S-A Andrada. I love yoga, my dogs and makeup! But most of all, I love winning! Hello. I am Megumi Sakai. Meg for short. Graduating. Economics major. That's it. Woah! Such high energy! Can you raise it even higher? Kidding, meowmeowmegumi! And last but not the least, let's say hi to V_rami! Wait. V, are you there? V! Wow! Good evening, everyone! It's V_rami! - Wow! That's my sister! - Wow! And my cousin! They're both so pretty! Good genes! Are you excited to meet our searcher? He is very handsome. Running for academic honors. Here he is... Gino Bautista! Good evening, everyone! Hi! Hi, Megumi! What happened to Megumi? Where'd she go? Oh no! Meowmeowmegumi is gone. It's AnnoyGin! He's hot. Megumi is your classmate? Unfortunately. V_rami, your entrance was insane. You're the one who's insane. It's a good thing we have a standby contestant for instances like this. Zoezoezoe16! OMG! Hi! I'm Zoe. Teacher by day, TikTokerist at night! Let's go straight to round one! I will ask you questions and your answers should match Gino's. This is to test your compatibility! And here is our first question. On rainy days, what does our searcher love to do? - Sleep! - Shhh! Five... When we were at Science camp all he did was sleep. Two... One! Time's up! Show your answers. And the correct answer is... SLEEP! Baby Bea and Issa got it right. Congratulations! See? Meg, why didn't you tell me? I will lose! Our next question. What is Gino's favorite subject in school? Meg, I need you. Couz, help. Five... Please? Four... Okay. - Yes! - Three... Two... One! Time's up! Boards up! Let me see your answers. And the correct answer is... History! - Yes! - Wow! Only V_rami got it right. Wooooaahh! Bro! The person you're waiting for is here. That's why it's so bright up there. Didn't she tell you? She did! I forgot. She told me all about that. Let's go in? Okay. This stream is getting hotter. Because we're down to our last two searchees! So exciting! We'll make things even hotter with the final round! We're down to the Ultimate Round: The Pick-up Line Challenge! Are you ready, girls? - Yes! - Ready! This is very simple. Gino will say a pick-up line and all you have to do is react. Whoever Gino chooses will be the winner! Okay Issa, let's start with you. Gino, go. Okay, Issa. - Are you a pizza? - Why? Because you're my crust. So poised like a true Filipina. Okay! It is now V's turn. Are you ready? Ready. V_rami. Are you a keyboard? Keyboard? Why? Because you're my type. Yuck! Yuck? That was the best reaction ever! So candid! So legit! So real! Can you do it again, please? Yuck! I guess we have a winner? For sure. Congratulations, V! Wow! You got an Ibong Adarna! Thank you so much! Thank you, thank you so much! It's V_rami everyone! - But hold on... - Thank you, Gino. What's this in the comments? "VGin"? V and Gino, do you like "VGin"? Of course! I love VGin! Because I'm a vi-gin. Kidding! All right! Thank you very much to all of you. Our stream time was super fun! Son. Let it all out! Why are you laughing? I'm not gonna cry, Dad. That's not what I meant. Night, son. Good night, Dad. The stream was super fun! Did you see the comments? They loved me! And Gino? He's so handsome! Why do you call him AnnoyGin? He's an a-hole in class. He's your classmate? That's great! Oh my gosh! VGin. That sounds so good. You looked cute even if you left early. You were watching? I'm embarrassed. Did you enjoy? How could I? AnnoyGin was the searcher! Boss. - Yes. - Just shake it off... Thanks for joining my stream. Are you sure you don't want your share of diamonds? Yes. You can keep them. Send money to your family. Thank you so much. Perfect timing, my wife is due soon. But I'm sorry I failed to make Megumi stay. That's okay. That's life! She's good at escaping. Finally, ChickBoy Taguig can operate at 50 percent capacity! Thank God. Yes. Honey, we'll visit your mom's grave tomorrow, okay? Okay. How was school, son? Online sucks! Resilience is key. After you graduate, you'll be in Singapore. We will be in Singapore. I'm booking hotels already. Moms, a lot of things can happen. We're not sure yet. You'll get it. I'm sure! You're the smartest kid in school. Well... Aside from that other girl that you always compete with. Megan, right? It's Megumi. What's her name again? Megumi. Look at that smile! So big! Well, I like her. So why haven't you brought her here yet? I haven't told her yet. How come? Because she finds me annoying. Why? I bully her all the time. She's so cute when she's annoyed. Her eyes disappear. What are you going to do now? Well, there's Cat Boy. Who? An alter account I made. She doesn't know it's me. Son, that's dangerous. I will tell her eventually. Yummy! Gino is really yummy! Right? I thought you were referring to the green mangoes. Or me! Let me see. You're more handsome! I told you. Meg. Oh no! Poor Tupe! That's fine! Gino looks like he has showered ten times more! At least this one's nice, unlike AnnoyGin! Team Tupe all the way! What? Didn't you see the comments earlier? They were like on Beyonce and JayZ's level. They're all for Team VGin! Oh my God! Quiet! You'll wake up Mama. OMG! Love_Guro said the prize I won is 10k! Gino really is a gift from the heavens. And that's just one stream. Imagine if the two of you stream every night. - Meg. - This tastes bland. Help me with Gino. Talk him into streaming with me. We're not close. Couz, please? Come on, Meg. You promised me you'd help me. Forget it. I'll just message Love_Guro. Maybe he'll take pity on me. Okay, fine. But no promises. I'll try tomorrow. Careful! My coffee. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! And for that, V will treat us some ChickBoy! ChickBoy tomorrow, for lunch! ChickBoy is here! Babe, I'll get it! Tupe? Hey! Meowmeow! Expectation versus reality. Babes! Let's eat! Thank you. Tupe! Is this the side job that you mentioned? Yes! ChickBoy, your delivery boy! I actually plan to get double shifts. What? Why? Don't you have Kumu already? Congrats, by the way! You were great! Oh, you saw it? Yes. Here. Last night. While waiting for you. Hey! Go back inside, the two of you! Sorry, Tupe. It's fine. Don't worry about it. You didn't confirm, anyway. I'll make it up to you in our next vlog. Next vlog? Don't you have Gino already? I mean Kumu. That's just for extra income. I'm still down to do our vlogs. But we should level up to get more views. Are you sure? Why? Don't you want to vlog with me anymore? Of course I want to. There you go. So stop sulking! V! The payment. Here. Keep the change. Thank you. V! Yes? You look cute here. Whatever! Japan and Singapore have strengthened their economic alliances... Psst! Psst! Have you talked to him? Message him already. Please. Condo. Gino, V_rami is my cousin. She wants to know if you'll stream with her again? Kbye. Sir, do you believe that their manufacturing sector also played a part in their economic recovery? That is a fantastic question, Gino! Yes, that is right! Singapore is also improving in terms of... He ignored my message! I bet he won't agree to stream with my cousin. Megumi, would you like to contribute to this discussion especially since you talked about this topic the last time? Megumi. Megumi? Megumi! Sir. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir. She's busy sending me private messages. You're something, Gino. Megumi, please stay after class. You too, Gino. Sorry. Why do you two keep on fighting? Who am I? Your professor or your referee? Huh? - Sorry, sir. - We're sorry. Hello? He... hello? If you continue fighting, I will find other candidates for the Singapore internship! Don't test me! - No! - No, sir! If you hadn't sent me a private message, we wouldn't be in this predicament right now! If you didn't expose me, we wouldn't be here right now! Sorry. But we both need this internship. So, can we please work in peace? You don't even need the internship! You're rich! You have connections! I'm sure you'll find a decent job after graduation. You're right. But it's my dream. And I want to make my parents proud. What about you? I need to find a good-paying job so I can give back to my adoptive family. I guess we have that in common. You know that I'm also adopted, right? Yup! By two amazing women. That's why I want to do well, so I can repay their love. Give them everything that they've given me. I guess we're the same. Okay. I'll stream with your cousin. Really? Thank you! On one condition. Can you please treat me a little nicer from now on? And I will not bully you as much. Wait! I'm not done yet! You'll owe me one favor... But... I'll save it for future use. Okay! But that favor is subject for approval. And cut! Perfect! That was great! The DIY costumes you made are incredible! I love it! I bet we will get more views because of this. Yup! But we still need more more views! Promise I'll do everything so we can get more views. So you'll always be happy. V! What? Gino agreed to stream with you! Oh my God! VGin is happening! Aww! Tupe got sad! Of course not! I was just wondering if she can do both vlogging and streaming. Of course I can! I'll vlog in the morning and stream at night! I promise! I won't leave you. Promise? As long as you promise to support my stream? Sure! Promise! VGin is happening! Hi, everyone! And hi Gino! It's so nice to see you again! How are you? Hi, V! How are you and your family? My family? We're fantastic! You have a lot of fan accounts already! Oh my gosh! Is this real? - Wow! There's so many of you! - Oh my gosh! We have fans! Oh my gosh! Thank you so much! Thank you, everyone! V! The joke. And for that, I have a joke to make you all happy. This is for you too, Gino! Okay! So... What is Bruce Lee's favorite fish? What? Sh-YAAAA-rk! I've heard that before! - It's still funny though! - Thank you! - Good one! - Thank you, Gino! Campaign? Go. G as in GAME! If you want me to do that, even though I don't know how, I'm G! You too Gino, right? Sure! If I get to hear more jokes like that then I'm G. Campaign it is! This is the leader board. This is where you can check if you're winning or if you're at the bottom. Currently, MisYu is Top1. They're live now! - Hello! - Hello MisYu fam! Hello, Yuan! Hi, Missy! How are you? Hi everybody! I hope your day is as pretty as Missy. Hey! They have been number 1 for two days! For now. But wait there's me. The beautiful, the talented, the indestructible V_rami! Yes! It's time to go to war! - Yeah! - Right! Joining Kumu campaigns is like going to war. You don't win with just beauty and strength. You need strategy! Of course! I know that! MisYu has a lot of tricks up their sleeve. That's why they're always on top. Not this time. They need to watch out for me because tonight is the night! VGin family, for all of you, we are officially joining the Couple Goals campaign tonight! So drop all those campaign gifts now! Yes! Let's go, VGin! Thank you so much! Thank you, everyone! Isn't our backdrop the bomb?! Yuan had it made for us! It's made by his famous designer friend. Their background is indeed amazing! MisYu may lead at first, but I am better! Ouch! Time out! What did you get yourself into? I can do this! I just need tools! Here! Should we research more on economic history? What do you think? Meg, the jokes! Sending! I knew it! I heard Sh-YAAAA-rk from you before! How embarrassing. What did the fish say to the other fish? What? Fish be with you! I'm so funny! Aahhh! Thank you! Thanks, everyone! You're amazing! Of course! Hello! You and Gino make us so happy! I finally get to meet my VGinatics! Hi, everyone! Thank you for dropping virtual gifts last night! You're all so nice! I feel so loved. I hope you... How are North and South Korea doing? V, I'm going to be late! My condo's clean now! Oh no, V! My uncle found a new buyer. No! Wait! Where are you going? I will mark my territory! It's so hot! Can't you just use rollers? And what are the lights for? Our electricity bill will be high again! No! What about the campaign? Are you ready for my scary jokes? Haven't heard from you in awhile, Cat Boy. Did you get scared, Gino? Hi, everyone! You're insane. I won't settle for anything less than top 1. I'm here. I'm watching! Wow! Cat Boy is back! As usual guys, this is just a quick live. How's your debate prep with AnnoyGin? Fine. But I still need a costume. Hambok? It's HANBOK. With an N! Hanbok. Of course I love you all! Auntie Luv, Mommy Jenggay... I will waste no time! If it means sleepless nights, so I can come up with lots of gimmicks, I'll do it! Does your cousin want to die of starvation? Are we doing a dancing vlog today? No. I'm just rehearsing for my stream later. Aren't you tired? Hi-yah! - V! V! - V? V? Water! Get water! I'm okay! Sorry! Technical difficulty. Really? VGin is already top 3? Knock knock! ChickBoy delivery! For me? Nope. - ChickBoy! - ChickBoy! Hey, be careful! What else do we need for the debate? The PowerPoint is ready. - The... - Ayiee. Why are you removing the skin? That's the tastiest part! It's unhealthy! Wow. Bruce Banner. Healthy living. Natasha, is that you? Are you sure you can still workout? Of course! I have an idea! Slowly. Slowly. Close your eyes. Relax. Free your mind. For Megumi Sakai? TO: MEGUMI HOPE THIS FITS. FROM: CATBOY Delivery for Megumi Sakai! Thank you. From who? A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR BEING A GREAT PARTNER. GINO From Gino. For me? Well... Guys, I have a cute story to share. So, I received something earlier. Chicken! All chicken skin! Who is it from? You know the answer to that! Of course from Gino! Thank you, Gino! You're so sweet. You're welcome. There are so many gifts! Yes! Congrats! Thank you! Thank you! I told you, I'll do everything and crush it! I always win! Because you know what I have that others don't? - Us! - Teamwork! Family! Uhmm... yeah. But I have a better secret weapon. What? My WHY. I never allowed myself to get distracted and I never allowed myself to forget my WHY. Why am I doing all of these? Why? Why can't I stop? Why am I willing to die for this? Why? You are mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! If you insist. - Thank you! - Thank you! - You're amazing, Megumi! - Good job! Congratulations on your win! This will definitely help with your internship application. Let's wait for the announcement of winners, okay? Okay guys, I'm losing my Wi-Fi signal. Congrats again! - Congrats, this is exciting! - Bye, sir! - Thank you. - Goodbye, guys! See you later, guys! Megu... You were amazing. Thank you. You too. Thank you. By the way, the chicken skin? That was for you. Thanks. But Gino... I hope that was the last one. It's nice that we're okay now, right? I just don't want V to get the wrong idea. Did you buy that hanbok? A gift from my friend. Would you ask that friend to stop sending gifts too? That's not the same. We've been friends a long time. I'm comfortable with him. Ouch! Anyway... you look beautiful. Thank you. Bye. Bro, the laundry. Okay. Everything is now in slow motion... but your heart beats at triple speed... And you don't even notice, that you're already smiling. She is smiling. Who's smiling? - You! - You! Really? Are you free tomorrow? Let's go out. Can we meet tomorrow? - Tupe asked me out! - Cat Boy asked me out! Go ahead. Tupe asked me out. Cat Boy said he finally wants to meet up. Are you going? You? Why here? Because today is special. I can't spend my savings on this. I have money from ChickBoy! - ChickBoy Delivery! - ChickBoy Delivery! Wow! I passed the college entrance exam. I got my acceptance letter yesterday. Wow, Tupe! Congratulations! I'm proud of you. Thanks. Wow. It's beautiful. I'll teach you. Is it difficult? No, it's super easy to make. Let me teach you. Okay, how? Like this. I couldn't get it at first. I lost hope. I wanted to give up. But as the saying goes, "try and try until you succeed". You just need patience. And one day... You'll realize... you already got it. It's already in front of you. OMG! V_rami! Missy? Yuan? OMG! It's V_rami in the flesh! What a coincidence! Is Gino here too? And he is? Tupe. - Tupe. - Yuan. You're the one from V's vlog! Yes. You two look good together. Thanks! You too! Thanks, bro! This is our favorite date place too. It's... not a date. Oh. Right. Can we take a selfie? Sure. Dude, join us! - Come here. - Me too? Smile! What a small world! Excuse me... I'm waiting for someone. You look good in yellow. That's your favorite color. Butter yellow. Not lemon yellow. You cry every time you watch One More Chance. You're scared of lizards. You love cats. Even though you've never had a pet cat. It's me... I am Cat Boy. Megu... Where have you been, V? What did you do with Tupe? You're both trending. Where's Gino? V? Oh my god! V was on a date with someone else? Not Gino? Well, she said it wasn't a date, guys. - I knew it! - Oh my God! According to V. Still, she was out with a different guy. Well... I mean, they look cute together. Meg! We need to plan an emergency stream. Call Gino. Now! Does it have to be now? People think I'm cheating on Gino. They're saying that we're a fake love team! But it is fake, right? I mean, it's just a love team? If you don't want to help me, fine. "Emergency"? Emergency stream. You're not doing it? Emergency stream with V. V is Megumi's cousin whom she lives with... Megumi who always watches V's streams... Good evening, everyone. VGin family. I know this stream came out of nowhere but we just want to clear some things up. Please give me... give us a chance to explain. We do not intend to hurt anyone. You know the real us, right? And you know the connection that we have. We all make mistakes. And I'm sorry. We're sorry. - VGin is live. - They're early. - Can I watch? - Bot! Your module. Gino's right. And I totally understand your anger but you don't have to worry about anything. Tupe is really just a friend and someone I vlog with. We're just friends, and he's not even my type. I owed him from high school so... I'm just making it up to him now by doing the vlogs. And hello? I'm Gino all the way! Gino and I have gotten to know each other so well... Hey, son... Tissue? Please. That's my boy! Wait a minute. Oh no! V dropped down to top 3. - Poor her. - Does she know this? Hello? Tupe? Are you still awake? I'll lock the gate, Dad. Son! Be cautious of COVID, okay? Because there's a V-rus. Tupe. You're going somewhere? I got a double shift. It's just that... you're not replying to my messages. What time will we meet tomorrow? Let's stop doing the vlog, V! If you're forcing yourself to do this because you owed me before, forget it. You don't have to make it up to me. Tupe... Tupe, I'm sorry if you were offended. I just said those things so the haters would shut up. - But I didn't mean any of it. - It's fine. It's better we stop the vlogs, so I won't be a hassle to you. Tupe! Meg? Again, good job to the both of you! This was such a difficult decision to make because you have outstanding GPAs and you did well in the debate but only one person can win the internship abroad. And that person is... you, Miss Sakai! Congratulations! Congrats, Megu! You only beat out Gino by a few points. But then again, congratulations, Megumi! Thank you, sir. Congrats, Megumi. Megumi, I will just expect the rest of the requirements via email. And Gino... Meg, has Gino replied about the stream? OMG! I forgot! It's Gino's finals week. Gino left you. Huhuhu. Where's Gino? Enough, haters! Allow them to explain. Hi! Hi, Vilmanian143. Thank you. You're new to the stream. I haven't seen you before. Thank you so much and welcome! I hope to see you in my next stream. Thank you. Shouldn't you be studying? That might be her. Spam text. Hi, Vilmanian! You're back! Thank you! This is for you. It's confirmed, VGIN is no more. The fan groups have gone. This is getting boring... No Gino, no VGIN. I haven't seen the VGIN Global Chapter fans in awhile. I'm sure they'll come back. They're just hurt. Some fans are just sensitive. They don't want to see you with other guys. Well, you know that it's you and Gino that the fans support. If Gino returns to the live stream, they will all come back. It's understandable, V. The campaign is for couple goals. They support the VGin tandem, not just you. And the other couple is consistent. He'll come back. Gino's just busy. We just need to reclaim our spot by the last day of the campaign. I hope so too. Anyway, update us. Megu... I'm sorry. I'm here to ask you to stream with V again. You're no longer at top 1. I don't care. But I do. Because of V. She needs this. I can't do this. I can't pretend to be happy and pretend that everything's okay because it's not. I am not. Megu... I like you. Who's "I"? AnnoyGin or Cat Boy? Both. You lied to me. You made a fool out of me! I didn't mean to. What do you mean you didn't mean to? Did you just wake up one day and you're suddenly Cat Boy? I didn't know how to tell you. Or how to talk to you. Because you knew me as your mortal enemy. The asshole! The bad boy! I'm AnnoyGin, right? But the truth is, I just got scared. I'm sorry. My mind and my heart got confused because... I didn't know who I liked more. I didn't know who to choose... AnnoyGin or Cat boy? You don't have to choose. They both like you. But do I like them? You just said so. I did? You said you didn't know who you liked better. That means you like me too. Forgive me? If you agree to stream with V again. For you. Okay. Thank you, Megu. But Gino, let's keep this a secret. Let's wait for the campaign to end before we tell V. FYI, another buyer will pay me next week. Let's see who goes first. I'm on my way. How many watches are you selling? This was a gift from Papa! He saved up for this. Why are you selling it? There are bills to pay! I'll help when I get my money from Kumu! We need the money now. Ma! Thanks for driving me home. Go on now. V might see us. Megu, wait. Do you remember the favor you owe me? In exchange of me saying yes to stream with V? Yes, but let's talk about it next time. Wait. May I... ask for one hug? Sorry. Okay. Maybe next time. G! G? Really? G. Game. Why are you smiling? Where have you been? Bought cellphone load. Have you spoken with Gino lately? No. Megu... I was thinking of inviting Gino over. Since it's the last day of the campaign, why not end it with a bang, right? What do you think? Sure. But I'll try to persuade him first. Please do, Megu. Thank you. Guys? Gino's here. Oh my God! Gino... Thank you for doing this live with me again. Let's do it? Are you ready? Yeah. Hi, everyone! Since this is the last day of stream, we have a surprise for you. And yes, I said 'we'. Guess who! Is that Gino? Hi, everyone. It's Gino! Gino, I missed you so much! Did you guys miss Gino too? Awww... But anyways, Gino, I want to thank you for coming and doing this with me. And I want to thank all the VGIN family who supported us from the start. But most of all, I wanna thank someone special. Someone who's been there for me when I was just starting out. My very nice cousin, Megu. - Hey! - Go! Come here. Sit there. Say hi. Hi. She's so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Gino? Um, yeah. I mean, of course. Beauty runs in the family. Awww... Gino's so sweet! He's so sweet! Right, Meg? Uhm... Isn't he sweet, Meg? Yeah... So, you agree? Gino is sweet? I thought you two were enemies? Didn't you use to call him AnnoyGin? What changed? Wow, we have a lot of viewers. - Let Meg answer, Gino. - Huh? Why is he sweet now? Is it because you two hugged earlier? Guys, this might ruin the chances of us winning but I can't be silent about this anymore. The reason why Gino hasn't been attending the stream is because he and Megu are dating. V! I saw you two! Earlier. Gino, you hugged Megu, right? Unless, it was all a dream? V! I asked you, Megu! I gave you a chance to come clean but you still lied to me! She lied to me! A prank? No, it's not a prank. Well, for me. That's what I feel. Well, you have Tupe, V. Tupe? We're just friends. We just went out to eat. We don't flirt or hug like Meg and Gino! And to think, Meg... You know that I like Gino, right? My gosh! This kid sure can act. Her name is Vilma, like the actress. V, Can we talk about this in private? No! You wanna talk about it? Talk to everyone that supported us from day one. Meg, Meg, Meg! Explain to them how you betrayed me. Your own cousin. V... I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't tell you immediately because I was confused too. Cat Boy and Gino are the same person. V! I'm sorry! I liked Megumi even before I met you. So, you used me to get closer to her? I agreed to stream with you and help you because of Megumi. Wow! So, I should be grateful for you two? Yes, because you wouldn't have come this far if it weren't for us. Fine. It's my fault for not telling you immediately. But I was just thinking about you! - Really? - Yes! I know how important this is to you. I know how badly you want to win. You're such a martyr. You're unbelievable. You don't even appreciate all the things I've done for you. Don't play the victim! You're playing the victim! I've always put you first but until the end, all you ever think about is yourself! I'm the one who got betrayed and now you're painting me as the bad guy? You're so ungrateful, Megumi! Vilma! We welcomed you to our house! I treated you like a sister! So did I, V! I did everything for you. You flirting with Gino was for me too? That is enough! No! That's the truth! I said enough! Let's go. Go home. Leave. Are you crazy? You actually streamed your fight live? So, I'm the bad one? Was there anything good about what you did? Is there? Didn't you hear me? Megumi betrayed me! She lied to me! Dammit! You'll continue your stream? I need to finish this, Ma! Are you that desperate? You want attention that much? Or is it for the money? You don't understand me, Ma. Then make me understand. Vilma, it's so hard to be your mother. It's so hard to talk to you because you never listen! You're the one who never listens, Ma. You immediately disagree with everything I say. The truth is, you're the one who never understands. And did you ever try to understand me? Have you ever thought about the sacrifices I made just so you can live a comfortable life? Even just once, Vilma, did you ever give an ounce of importance to what I say? Which one? The time when you said I couldn't do it? Or the time when you said my decisions are wrong? Why, Ma? Is it wrong to have ambition? Is it wrong to think that I'm one in a million? Is it wrong to wish that my dreams will come true? No. But do it the right way! Do it without hurting other people! You don't even think if what you're doing is good for you! You didn't even finish school. You're too obsessed with this. You're just like your father. I've seen this before, V! Your father got obsessed with his dreams too. He forgot about the business. We drowned in debt! He drowned in his ambition! When he lost the election, he sunk even deeper. He drowned because you kept reminding him of his failures. He needed you but you weren't there. Vilma, if I joined your father in his misery, who will provide for our family? But you never forgave him. You never gave him a second chance! That's why when he got sick, he immediately gave up because he was tired of all your nagging! Because of you, I lost the only person who believed in me! - Daughter... - You're right, Ma! I will make sure I won't end up like Papa. I will try hard and I will win! So, I can finally leave this place. Because I don't want to be stuck with you. Hurry up and get your money. So, you can get out of my house. Told you, leave it to us! Hi, Tupe. I won the campaign. Here's my down payment. I can finally buy the unit. I'll send you my uncle's number. You can pay him directly. Okay. But what about your commission? No, it's okay. But, Tupe... You worked hard for it. We worked hard for it. I watched your live last night. Okay. So, you saw it. How they made a fool out of me. But didn't you fool them too? You used them. You're not really in love with Gino, right? Or are you? What about me, V? Didn't you just use me too? You know the truth, Tupe. The truth? What truth? Is there anything real between us? Tupe. I'm sorry. Sorry for? What for? Because you hurt me? Because you led me on? I get it. You actually amaze me. You're a person who never gives up until you get what you want. But really, V? Even the people who truly love you, your mother, your brother, Megu? You can hurt them like that? And me? I love you, V. I trusted you again. I said yes to everything. But I have to accept the fact that you will never see me. That you will never love me the way I love you. Congrats, V. I hope you're happy you achieved your dream. Look, guys! V can climb a tree. That's my daughter! Go V! Go V! Go V! Vilma! Get down from there! If you fall, I swear to God I'll kill you! Ignore your mom. Go on. You're almost there. Just use a hook. It's easier. I want to reach it by myself. Hey! Rosario... Rosario... Why did you stop it? Play it. Go on! I told you! Let me see it... V. You know what... you just don't want to see how much Mama loves you. Maybe not in the way that you want, but she loves you, nonetheless. - Ma! - Yes? V is live! Hello! Good evening, everyone! Thank you for watching this sudden stream. I feel like I need to explain a lot of things. The truth. It's true I'm a liar. I don't like Gino that way and they didn't betray me. It's true that I'm ambitious. I wanna be the best. I wanna be number one. But the truth is I've become arrogant. I thought I could do everything by myself. I forgot that I wouldn't make it this far without all of you. If I didn't have all the people... who's done nothing but support and love me. It's true what they say, it's lonely at the top. What is a good view for, if you're all alone? And... I realized that... that before striving to be successful, you should first be a good person. And if only sorry could take away all the pain I've caused you... but I know that's not enough. I don't know how to make it up to you. But I will do whatever it takes. And I'm hoping... I'm hoping that you can all forgive me. Is your sorry even legit. - That was too much. - You made us cry V. I'm still a fan. You're trending, V! That was heartfelt. - We got you, V. - I'm crying now. You're really brave. It's better if you apologize in person. Glad you apologized. Don't worry, there's no flying slipper. Who's a Vilmanian? I'll remove your face on the logo. - Come down, my daughter. - What? Ma, I'm sorry. It's okay. I've already forgiven you... even before you made the mistake. I'm sorry. I love you, Mama. Sweetheart, go to Megu. You did so much for me, but I never once thanked you. Meg... I'm sorry. Oh no! It's happening! Megumi is leaving us! Only for three months! Still! Mama! What are you doing?! We might get hungry on the way! Oh, V! Don't mind our kitchen, it's dirty. I'll have it renovated. And yes, I won't be buying a condo anymore because this is my home! Meg, Meg, Meg! What does it feel like to be the newest intern of Marina Econometrics? Excited! But I'm also nervous. What for? I'll be with you all the way to Singapore. That's exactly why! We have to go, we'll be late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Wait! Picture! - I'll do it... I'll do it... - Wait up! V, come here. There... Say Aye! Aye!!! - Aye! Aye! Aye! - Dance, Gino! Late! We're going to be late! Meg. What if I join the send off party? There's no space in the car anymore, and you still have an unfinished business. I can take care of that tomorrow. No! Do it today! Listen to me! - I'll miss you! - I'll miss you! - Go now. - Yeah. Bye bye! Don't I get a hug? Let's go. How stingy. - Let's go. - Okay. Bye! Delivery! Woah! That's a big box! Who sent it? It's from V! Who are these for? Dad, this is for you. - Wow! This is for me? - Oh! I wonder what's this... Oh! This one's fancy! This one's fancy, my love! - Wow! - This is mom's. Is there anything else? Is there more? - Is there more? - None. Really? But why did she send all these? Gifts because we helped her with her vlogs. Oh my! And these are for our online classes. Wow! Seems like she's changed! I'll go ahead. - My love! - Yes? There's one more gift! I wonder who this is for... Of course, it's yours! Did you think she forgot you? Thank you. This isn't enough to pay for all my stupidity. - But I hope you know that you are always enough. - V. Son! Handsome men like us are the forgiving type, right? Good looks, good heart, right? Stop it... You know son, forgiveness can also be a gift to yourself. Just stating facts. - We're handsome, right? - Right! Hi, Tupe! Let's make up please? Thank you for the gifts. Excuse me. - Tupe, I'm sorry. - For what? I'm sorry that I led you on before. I'm sorry that I hurt you. Sorry that I didn't have the courage to admit to myself that I like you. I know I deserve your anger but I will do everything I can to deserve your forgiveness. Because I really miss you so much, Tupe! Have I told you that I've liked you for a while now? Tupe! I thought you said you never give up? It's a prank! Tupe! Are you absolutely sure you like me? You can't take that back anymore. What if your followers don't like me? What's important is that I like you. What about you? Do you still like me? I've always liked you. Always will.
