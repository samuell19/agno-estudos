You survive a POW camp to play with a hack like that? You know, there's a fine line between jazz and bad.

I wanna try out a few tunes and see what flies. Jo agreed to let us play a set here Sunday night. - No. I have dinner with the family every Sunday. - It'll be after dinner. - I'm not going out late on a Sunday. So make it another night. - No! We're booked here for a set Sunday at nine. That's the deal. - In the future I need more notice. I need a schedule. I got a wife and kids and three other standing gigs. - How much is it gonna pay? - When we win the contest it'll be more than- - Tonight was your only freebie, Private. - Every gig I play is food and shoes for my kids. - Alright, I'll make sure we get something. - Standard rate. - Fine. Sunday, I'll have all the charts. - Sunday. - What day of the week is Sunday? - It is Sunday. - Oh, no, no. That's fine, I'm not doing anything. - Hey, anybody need a lift? - Swing by the Rio? - Yeah, sure. - Hey kid, try this one. So a giraffe walks into a bar and says, "The highballs are on me!" - No, I don't get it. (audience laughing) - Well you see, giraffes are really tall. - Right, right. With their necks- (audience laughing) - If you're gonna be a bandleader you better learn how to talk to people. - So now you're gonna pile on too? - I was on the Reid. My ship explodes, I'm in the water with my dead friends. I play to forget that shit, not re-live it. - So you're saying my band's a shipwreck? - Just forget it. My class load's too heavy this semester. Find another sax player. - Wait, just wait. Rubber said you were good enough to go all the way to New York with us someday. You just gonna throw that away? - That's kind, but I barely remember the guy. - He was my best buddy in the 37th. We talked about starting a band when we got back and hitting it big in New York. And he made me promise to look in on his wife if anything happened to him. So I'm an asshole 'cause I've been walking past her door, I can't make myself knock. She'll wanna know how it happened. - How bad was it? - Bad. Friendly fire. - Don't tell her. Make sure she's okay. You owe him that. But here's some free legal advice, don't go to trial unless you're prepared to lose. I'll see you Sunday. (upbeat music) - Looking ahead to the end of the month, we are happy to announce our Tribute to the Troops contest will be broadcast from the beautiful Ohio Theater. It'll be a special audience to be a part of as your applause will factor into our judges' decision. (soft music) (door bell ringing) - Hey! What's the big idea?

Are you gonna make me yell down the sidewalk or do you want something? - I'm Donny Novitski. I was a buddy of Michael's in the 37th. - [Woman] Who is it? - Just a a friend of Michael's, Ma. - I would have called first, but I didn't have the number. - I didn't mean to be rude. I'm sorry I'm a mess. I was baking a cake for church. - I don't wanna bother you. - No, it's no bother. He mentioned you a lot in his letters. - How did you find me? - Michael gave me the address. - And you're supposed to check in on me. - I'm just awfully sorry - - Well, I'm getting along. - Say, I have some pictures of Michael. From when we were over there. - You do? - I didn't think to bring them. Maybe you wanna see them sometime? - Sure. - I could come back. - You could come for dinner. - I don't want to impose. - How about Thursday. Say 5:30? - Sure. If you're sure. - I'll see you then. (upbeat music) - Sorry I'm late, Honey. How was your day? - Fine. - Did you help Grady with his homework? - Didn't have time. (upbeat music) - We have a few bottles of Coca-Cola or he can have milk. Do you know what he likes to drink? Julia? Do you know what he drinks? - No, I don't know him at all, Ma. I'm late for work. - Was he with Michael when he died? - He didn't say. - Then don't ask him. He'll tell you if he wants to. Remember your uncle never spoke a word about the first war after he got back. Not for the rest of his life. - So I don't ask questions, he doesn't talk, and we just sit across the table in silence. - Next to baseball, it's the national pastime. - I just wanna know what happened. - And what do you think that will get you? - Sleeping through the night.

Anyway, I have these photos but maybe we should wait till after dinner. - No, let's look now. It's fine. (soft music) - That was in boot camp when we met. - That picture's in Fiji, it's right after we landed. I had a tan about ten minutes off the boat 'cause I'm half Italian but he was full Polish, so he was a boiled lobster.

Now remember that you heard them here at Oliver's before they hit big time. (upbeat music) - The crowd sure loved the two of you. - Thank you. How about two Manhattans? - Oh, why not. I even remembered the bridge. - You did more than that. You knocked it out of the ball park. It feels fantastic, doesn't it? - It sure does. - Hey, Donny. - Yes, sir? - Say, Private, that was aces. Can you do tomorrow night? - I'd have to ask the guys. And it'd be the same set. Okay, the same set's fine. Ask the guys and let me know. Bob, those drinks are on the house. Have a good night, folks. - Thank you, Oliver. Thank you. - How about that! - It was "You Deserve It" that did it. They liked that one the best. Oh, it's got a real Duke Ellington flavor. But those surprise chords, they're a little Stan Kenton. - How do you know about Stan Kenton? - Michael's record collection. - Ah-huh. I should have guessed. Say, speaking of Michael. - Yes? - You gotta admit Donny Nova has a terrific ring to it and I was just thinking- - I married Michael Trojan and my name is Julia Trojan. - Naturally, but what if you used your maiden name? - Julia Adams, it sounds made for the pictures. - I'm not gonna change who I am. - It might be a distraction to some people if- - If it's a distraction it's because they're 12-year-old boys. I've learned to live with that. - But wouldn't it be great if you could- - Please don't push me. - Julia, Julia, Julia, hey. (upbeat music) Think of all the record sales with our names- - Please stop. (upbeat music) - There's no reason to get upset. - You're not hearing me. - I'm just saying, think about it up on a marquee, - The Donny Nova Band featuring Julia Adams. - Michael's buried in someplace called Manila. I'll never get to Manila. I never got to say goodbye. A lot of things just vanished with no explanation and I want to know how his hands were folded in the casket, if his uniform was pressed, if his hair was combed right. A million things that keep me up at night and I don't need anything else erased. Certainly not his name. - Trust me, you don't ever wanna see Manila. - I just want answers. Look, it's the Donny Nova Band featuring Julia Trojan. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. - Deal. - Let's go tell the guys we got another gig. Then you can walk me home, Donny Nova. (upbeat music) - So I say to woman, "I survived mustard gas and pepper spray, so I guess that makes me a seasoned veteran." (audience laughing) I'm okay, I'm okay. This is me. Julia, as much as I know you'd like to, I can put myself to bed thank you very much. (audience laughing) - What if he's like this on game day, or doesn't show at all? - I think you got bigger problems. - Is that so? - You really think "You Deserve It" is a winner? - It's a solid blues structure. Good hook. Can't go wrong with that. - I think Dwight Anson might have a better song. - How do you know what kind of song Dwight Anson's got? - There's no rule against a side man playing in more than one band. - I got that rule. - Look, I wanna play with you and the guys, but I need to win. Teaching barely covers my rent. You would do this to your brothers? - Careful buddy. You don't get to judge. - I will knock your goddamn teeth out. See how well you play for Dwight Anson then! - Donny stop! Please, just walk me home. (soft music) The show's in a week. I'll be on the bandstand with the best song. - Walk me home, Donny.

(audience laughing) Michael would've done it better. All of it. - It's here somewhere. Listen. When I was young I had no need for compass or for guide. A starry chart of instinct was imprinted here inside. And unaware that days of doubt and loss would soon begin. - The one true course to follow was the one I found within. What's that, Shakespeare? Davy give that to you? - Oh, neither bard nor beard. It's me, silly. - You really wrote that? - They're just little poems, but writing them helps me get through it all. - Let me see. - Absolutely not. They're private. - Is it a diary, or poems? - Just poems. - Then what's the big deal? I'll return it in the morning. Come on, I'm a guy in need of inspiration. - You'll make fun of them. - I won't.

(audience laughing) - I don't know what to say. - Say that this can be our song for the contest. - But we have a song. "You Deserve It." And your lyrics are perfect. - My lyrics are snappy, they're for kicks. You have honesty, you have sensitivity, you have- - Lady parts. (audience laughing) - Maybe that's it, but whatever it is, this song's better. - But the contest's in a few days. - And we need Nick on the bandstand with us. He'll know this one's a winner. Come on, I'll have the charts finished by tomorrow. I'll stay up all night. I'm good at that. - It's not about the troops, Donny. The hell it isn't. It's your story. What better tribute to the troops? - It's a solo for a woman. You wouldn't even get to sing. - It's the Donny Nova Band featuring Julia Trojan. That was the deal. - Singing about Michael.

Weren't they fabulous? And now it is time for our judges' momentous decision. Thank you, Roger. The winning song that will represent the great state of Ohio is "Love Will Come and Find Me Again" by the Donny Nova Band. - Mr. Nova, would you like to say a few words to the listeners? - This is gonna change every one of our lives. For all us vets out there, we appreciate this more than we can say. - Julia. - Well, this is certainly more exciting than singing the solo in church. Thank you so much. Thank you. - On behalf of everyone here at the beautiful Ohio Theater, on the Rive Gauche of Lake Erie, congratulations and goodnight one and all! (upbeat music) (Captions provided by r3ddit user c0asurdud3) - And we're off the air. That's it everyone. Thank you all, thank you audience! - Bring in the house curtain. - Well done, Jean. - Such an honor, Roger. - Bobby, could you come take their picture, please? All right, fellas, get together there. That's it. Closer, all right, here we go. Big smiles. Perfect. Mr. Nova, congratulations. I'm Roger Cohen, producer. Let me go over a few things with you right away. - Yes, sir. Now here are the papers that explain everything that will happen in New York, rules, time restrictions, so forth. Two things are most important. The broadcast is on Sunday, December 16th, but there's a preliminary off-air on Wednesday the 12th to determine which bands make the broadcast. - A preliminary? Wasn't this the preliminary for New York? - Well, it's only a two-hours program Mr Nova. - Wait a minute, I thought- - Sweetie. Furthermore, you're responsible for travel and accommodation expenses for any and all personnel, whether on-air or support staff. - We have to pay for everything? - Yes. - Sir, even if we go cheap it's gonna be close to a grand. We don't have that kinda money. Nobody does. Who can afford that? - Only enough bands to make a two hour program. - Well, that's hilarious, Jack Benny, but the punchline is we can't go. - Listen, the public believes all 48 states are being represented here. That's not what you're selling. - What are you? The legal? - As a matter of fact, I'm getting a lot of- - No, no, no. What we are selling here is Bayer Asprin in case you didn't notice. - I fight Hitler so you can sell Asprin? - This isn't about you. - It's "American Songbook's Tribute To The Troops," sir. We are the troops. - Actually, you're just a contestant and you have until Friday, November 16th, to call NBC and confirm or forfeit your appearance. - We should at least be entitled to travel money. - What you think you are entitled to, may not be compatible with broadcasting a nationwide music contest with enough time to sell- - Bayer fucking Asprin. (audience laughing) Watch it, pal. Look, if you're not happy with this opportunity we are handing you, we'll give it to the runner up. New York won't know the difference. - Everyone just heard us win. - Who? A couple of folk in Cleveland? Come on, kid. Rule number one, if no one saw it, it didn't happen. - So if by some miracle we raise the money in time, we gotta call you to tell you we're gonna pay our own way, put ourselves up and then we still gotta audition With no guarantee we'll even be on the broadcast? - Don't touch me! - I don't make the rules. - (chuckles) Well, who does? 'Cause maybe they take suggestions. Like throwing us out a plane and seeing how many make it parachuting in. Or a three day march. Hey, it's winter so we lose a few toes. - We don't ask for much. We dig our own latrines. - We don't need clean water. - What's a little dysentery between friends. - You remember that, right? Because you were there, right? - Or were you in your fucking corner office? - This copy is yours. Again, congratulations. It's a swell tune. How many bottles will it take to make this all go away? - I can think of something quicker. It never ends!

And he looks out at all these troops, and he knows they need something to pick them up, but not a sappy ballad. So he starts taking off on the drums (Donny mimics drumbeats) And I look at him and he says, "Faster!" Bumps it up again and says, "Faster!" Kicks it up again and yells, "Now sing!" So I start singing like my life depends on it and it's not a love song anymore, oh, no, no. It is a, I don't know, it is a battle call or something. I swear, he turned that camp into the bandstand on the top of the New Amsterdam. - That must have been something. - Say, when's your father back in town? It'd be nice to put him on a guest list.

Were his eyes open? - There were no eyes! Jesus Christ, Julia. It's not like the movies. Okay, it's just not like the movies. There was no face, no hands to fold, there's no hair to comb. Just stop it. - I am still waiting. Hill 700 was this big hill we had to keep from the Japs. Michael and I were in a trench on the side of the hill, going on three days without sleep. There were these pillboxes above us, these bunkers, they would just fire down and we were trapped. So that night it starts raining and Michael says one way or another we gotta try to make some headway. We gotta toss some grenades, then make a run at them or fall back. So Michael throws first and it must have gotten pretty close because they start firing down again. It's dark and they're firing and it's raining and I have my grenade in my hand and I pull the pin and my grenade drops right into the mud. I know the spoon's released now and I start reaching for it and I can't see it. And Michael is reaching around down there, he's trying to grab it, I say, "Get out." I jump out and I roll down the hill and I know he has to be behind me, he has to be 'cause I said to get out. And I rolled into a foxhole and I felt it go off (sobs). And he wasn't next to me where I thought he'd be and I climbed back up there and it was just black. And I sat in that pit all night and I tried to keep the rain from washing things away and getting in the mud. - Julia, wait, Julia. No. - I'm sorry. - Donny, just go home. For God's sake go home, Donny. (ominous music) - I don't know how much longer we can wait. The guests were told you'd begin at seven and it's already 7:15. - Table four just sent back the chicken. - Another bus went by and she wasn't on it. Mr. Nova, we have a full house tonight. - Can I use your phone? - Certainly. Now, you'll open with "Love Will Come and Find Me," the contest song, right? - We like to save that one for the end, draw in people to listen to the big broadcast coming up. - Well, if they're not all asleep by then. It's really getting late. Plaza 72638, please. Then it's fine. - We'll open with "Love Will Come and Find Me," it's fine. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Mrs. Adams? - Yes? - Hi, it's Donny Novitski. Is Julia there? - Well, you see - - We're supposed to go on at Lakewood Supper Club- - 20 minutes ago. - Is she on her way? - I am so sorry, Donny, she's come down with a terrible... Well she's very sick and it came on suddenly. - [Donny] Is she there? She wanted to call but we didn't have the number for the new club, see- - Let me speak to her. - No, no, no, no. She really can't get out of bed, dear. I'm so sorry. She'll call when she's better, I'll make sure of it. - All right then. All right, good bye- - Let's just play the gig. - And Mrs. Trojan? - She's ill. I'll be singing everything tonight. Let's go, fellas. (soft music) - Is she out? What's that mean for New York? - We're not gonna go? Does this mean we can't go? - Your father used to have people do that to me call and lie for him. - I'm sorry. - As bad as what you or I have been through, it's nothing compared to what he has. He made a promise to Michael to look after you. He kept his promise. You made a promise to that band to show up and sing. Your father probably told me the truth only once in our marriage. He said, "Shit happens. (audience laughing) The trick is not to step in it. And if you do, for God's sake, June, don't just stand there." - It was his fault, Ma.

We won't have enough to go the way you and Michael dreamed, but that's okay. We can take the bus, and stay who cares where. - I'm letting him down. - You know how Michael and I met? First day of rehearsal for our high school production of "Desert Song." I was sulking in the back 'cause I didn't get the lead. He plops himself down and says, "Don't sing because you need to get the lead. Sing because you just need to sing." And then he says, "The girl who got the lead stuffs her bra with so much Kleenex, one cigarette ash and she'll go up like the Hindenburg." (audience laughing) That's the Michael I knew. Sing because you just need to sing. (soft music) - Anyone heard from Donny? - Rehearsal's still on for tonight. We can rehearse all we want, but what's the point without Julia? - She's fine. Just a 24-hour bug. - I think they've both got something you don't get over in 24 hours. - A lotta landmines there. - We gotta worry about our next gig falling apart every time they have a spat? - You're a selfish bastard, you know that?

He died in battle. - My condolences, Ma'am. We have a few vets here and there in some of the bands but nobody's walked in here with everyone having served. That's really something. - Yes, Sir, it is. - This is a story folks can really get behind. We want you in the broadcast and because of the military angle, we're putting you up last. The finale. - Mr. Haupt, thank you so much. - You really mean it? - Yes, Ma'am. So go have yourselves a swell couple of days off here in the city, and we'll see you Sunday. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Paula, go ahead and have them sign the release forms now. Put us ahead on Sunday. - Now, these forms are the releases that allow us to broadcast your song. The name of your song is "Love Will Come and Find Me Again" and you two are the sole composer and lyricist? - [Both] Yes, ma'am. - Very well, then sign here. Both of you. We'll see you Sunday at the Palace Theater. Use the stage door on 47th street. This is your copy. Oh and congratulations. - Thank you. So long, gentlemen. - All right, who's next? - We're up to Texas. The Boogie Woogie Wranglers. (audience laughing) - Jesus Christ. Damn. Well, good thing we're sponsored by Aspirin. (upbeat music) - Did you see him? No. - Please don't wait in the wings. Only the next band up should be out here. - We're the next after the next. - Please, just please keep this area clear. - We checked all the other dressing rooms. He's not here. - I don't understand it. What did he say after the microphone check? - Just that he needed to take care of some things but he'd be back by showtime. - We got him, he's here. - Jesus, Jimmy, What the hell are you trying to pull? - I'm sorry, but you gotta see this. - Where were you? We were worried sick! - The New York Public Library. Law section. - Aw, for God's sake! - We're on in two more numbers! - I know, I know, Donny. When you gave me that release form this morning, I had to look a few things up. - Jimmy, we gotta tune, we gotta get ready, there's not time for this. - Donny, Donny, listen! You should have shown me this form earlier. Look, this clause right here. It's the underlying rights to your song. - What's that? - You signed away the rights to your song. And this clause, they're only obligated to use us as walk-ons. - What? - I don't get it. - It means if we go out there, NBC and MGM will own your song outright and they can have Frank Sinatra or anybody else sing it in the picture while we fake playing along in the background like a bunch of monkeys. - No- - And if you ever want to perform the song again yourself, you pay them royalties to do it. - Did all these bands have to sign that thing? - They must have, but I don't think any of them understand what they've signed. That's what they're counting on. - What are we gonna do? - You can't just give away your song. You can't go out there, Donny. - God dammit! - I say walk away, Donny. - You can say, I came, I saw, I said fuck it. (audience applauding) - I'm with them. Let's just go. Screw these people. All they want to do is use our uniforms and wave us around like flags. We're not props, Donny. And we are not for sale. We've already given them everything we got. We're goddamn United States veterans, and they wouldn't know real sacrifice if it slapped them in the face. - That's what we gotta do. We gotta slap them in the face. Julia, do you know every original word that you wrote for "Welcome Home?" - Yes. - And you could sing them right now? - Donny, I don't- - Can you sing every original word you wrote or not? - Yes. - If we go out there, we gotta play something they wouldn't dare put in a movie. We gotta play something that Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra would not have the balls to sing. Because in five minutes we could be in every living room in America and we could let tell them hear what we go through every goddamn day. So lets tell them the truth. Let the guys who made it home know somebody out there has their backs. "Welcome Home." (soft music) - You're talking about a suicide mission.

They were dancing and singing and listening to music that was helping them process things that that were difficult. I talked about Justin Timberlake a lot to the writers because I feel like Donny Novitski is making that's brand new. Brand new, and so that the young people and older people, they are all attracted to this new driving pulse. From the beginning you're gonna get as far away as possible. So the period was very exciting to me. Frankly, I have never really worked in a piece in the 40s or the 50s so I really wanted to work in a piece of that style.

It's a division made up of people from Ohio and the mid-west region and that division actually fought in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. - Doing research about what the guys experienced during World War II, and the vets who fought for our country, I think it's really important to know all of that. - I had pictures all over my dressing room of vets at the time. We found a photo that represented Michael. We made a dog tag for him, all that kind of stuff just to make it real. - That's what I live with. Just kind of knowing what it was like for them to come home after World War II. Like my dad, they were very private about that. And I think this story peels away some of that privacy and you understand what certain people went through coming home from a war. And it's really nice to know that we are shedding light on their story. - Every show we dedicate it to someone that has served or someone that has supported someone that has served. So a wife of a military member or someone that has served that we know. - [Man] Dan McQueen. One, two, three. - [All] Dan McQueen.

And he is such a dynamic performer and works as a great collaborator, a great partner, to follow my vision, but to helpfully ask questions. - What if we circle- - And Laura, I have done a couple of things with her. I mean, Laura is just extraordinary. She has a timelessness that's really beautiful and so the partnership of working with both of those actors was really great. ♪ Letting go of what might have been ♪ - There're two main challenges that come to my mind about playing this role in the show. And one of them is vocally. Just the stamina of singing the show. It's a big sing for this character.

We have some musicians who have always had an acting bug or a theater bug, or who have a good voice. And so we are helping them learn about the theater and about the discipline of doing a chosen week and investing in character. So it's a really great opportunity for us to find teamwork actually between the group, 'cause they have to help each other out. (soft music) - Jeff Parker, the trombone player, tells about how scary it was for him to go out and have to play the trombone in front of people and how frightening that was in a similar way to the trumpet player in the show, like he's never done anything like this as an actor. So its a great sense of partnership with each other. ♪ It's time to let the whole world know ♪ - I took lessons for a couple of years as a kid and I totally hated it and I wanted just to play sports and do other things. - This is great. - And my stuff is- - Still pushing that one. - Am I? - Yeah, you are. - Oh, drive. - Right, right, right. I had to completely relearn how to play the piano from just sitting down and plucking out a C-major scale to learning key signatures in terms of everything. Everything of musical theory, everything like that. (piano playing) (Donny humming) ♪ It's time to tell the world we count ♪ - By the time we've opened it all then, probably seven months of diligently playing everyday for at least three hours. - Now we are at our tuning call, and these lovely gentlemen are playing their instruments warming up for the show. (upbeat music) Joe Correl, ladies and gentlemen. (blues music) Yes, they are all playing live. - They're such good actors. And they can pick up these instruments and play it with such professionalism I just sit on the floor and have a free concert every rehearsal. (upbeat music) (girl laughs) - It's a story about vets, it's a story about politics, it's a story about our own history, but more importantly than that, even to me, is that it's a story about art healing the soul and saying that you can be lost, you could have confusions and things that you don't understand but so often music and art helps us find the direction, find a vision of a world we'd rather be in that says sometimes there are things that are broken underneath. Sometimes the foundation of a country is a little bit cracked, or the foundation of our heart is a little bit cracked having lost somebody, but that if you deal with the stuff even if it's a little ugly, you deal with the truth, that you will find a better avenue, or a better place to go. And I think that's the prevalent theme in our show. We will, as people, as couples, as families, go through hard times, but we must believe that something better is in front of us and that we'll be able to capture it. ♪ And they're waiting to hear our song ♪ ♪ You can bet we intend to stay ♪ ♪ Right this way ♪ (upbeat music) (audience cheering) (Captions provided by reddit user coasurdude)
