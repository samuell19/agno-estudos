[BOXING BELL] -Come on, kid. Let that right go. REFEREE: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-- -There you go. There you go! Use that right! REFEREE: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, out. -You all right, Bud? -Ah, I guess so. Boy when you sock 'em, they stay socked. [WHISTLE] [WHISTLE] DAVE: All right, get down here, boy. -Hey, that's rubbing, not drinking. -I just found that out. -Now listen, kid. If I'm going to be your trainer, you've got to do what I tell you, see? -Well I do, don't I? -Didn't you hear me yell to you to open up with your right? -Aw, Dave, you know. -Yeah, I know. Afraid you'll kill somebody again, huh? Listen, You ain't that tough. -I wouldn't be in here with a manslaughter charge against me if it wasn't for what happened to Sweeny. -If you'd only hit him during the fight instead of after the bell. -Well, I had no choice in the matter. He didn't like the decision, he rushed across the ring, and I had to defend myself. -Yeah, I know. There was something screwy about that fight though. Nobody will ever make me believe he died from that punch. -Maybe you're right. But every time I get set to throw a finishing punch, I see Sweeny's face, and-- well, I just can't let it go. -Listen, you're being paroled tomorrow. I'm getting out next week. We've got a future before us, plenty of dough, if you'll only let loose when you get in the ring. GENE: I'll do my best, Dave. -With my brains and your right, we'll carve our names in a private niche in the elusive hall of fame. GENE: What? -I read it in a book once. [INAUDIBLE] GENE: Maybe you'd better read another book. -I will sometime, when I'm not so busy. -You know, that George Miller turned out to be a good friend. -Yeah. -If it hadn't been for his promise of employment, we never would have gotten our parole. You know that, don't you? -Yeah, I guess you're right. He reminded me of another boxing promoter I used to know. Say, I'll bet you're thinking of a gal named Claire. -I bet you're right. She's promised to meet me the day I get out. -Yeah, they all do. -I was pretty much of a fool to arrange his pardon if you're still so interested in him. -But I've told you time after time, George, I was never serious with Gene. He's a nice boy, but I much prefer a promoter. -It will make it decidedly inconvenient if he's still infatuated with you. -Now don't you worry about that. I can take care of him all right. -If it's true, perhaps you'd better meet him tomorrow. -Nonsense. I'm not going up there. He knows my memory's bad. And I just forgot the date. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in. Oh, it's you, Harris. -Yes, sir. This is one time I can tell my host the truth, and say that I sincerely hope I will never come back here again. -I can understand that. And if I ever see you again, Harris, I hope it won't be here. -Thank you, sir. -Goodbye and good luck. -Thank you again for everything. -Oh, Baby, how are you? Hey, take it easy, take it easy. I'm not used to all this affection. Aw, you're a sweet pup. You'll never know how much I've missed you. You know, I was really expecting another girl to meet me. Hey, how'd you get here? Mary! So you're the one responsible for Babe being here. -Yes. -That was nice of you. -I'm glad to see you looking so well. -Thanks. You've made me very happy. -That makes me happy. I didn't know if you'd remember me after three long years. -Why, how could I forget you? -I've looked forward to this day for a long time. -So have I. -Looking for someone? -Yes. I sort of expected another friend to meet me here. What's the matter, Babe? Hungry? -I could eat something, too. -I'd like a little food myself, if you know of a place where they serve something besides stew and beef. -I know the nicest little tearoom. And they serve homemade doughnuts. -Doughnuts? Why, you've remembered my weakness. Did you hear that, Babe? Doughnuts. Come on, we're going doughnut hunting. Still working for Miller? -Yes. -How does it happen you have the day off? -My grandmother was very ill. -Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. -But you look like you'll pull through all right. -I look like-- Oh, oh, I see. A little steak, Baby? That a girl. Miller certainly proved himself a good friend of mine. If it hadn't been for him, I never would have gotten out on parole. -Don't forget, you were one of the best box office attractions he ever had. -I've worked very hard to show Mr. Miller I appreciate everything he's done for me. -Gene? -Yes? -I was just thinking how nice it would be if you'd get out of the fight racket. -Not a chance. It's the only thing I know, Mary. You mind? -Not if you don't splash. -I won't. That's a fine thing. -I'm afraid you're not very proficient in the art of dunking. -Well, I'm a little bit out of practice. If it hadn't been for that bad knuckle, I might have made the Olympic team. -Just an amateur, eh? Let me give you a little professional coaching. -Well, go right ahead, professor. -Now, particularly note the little finger. -The little finger? -It has to get the necessary balance. -Oh, I see. -Then, you take it between your first and your third finger, thus. -Thus. -And note the elbow. Never do that. -No? -Down. Much more graceful line. -Mm hmm. -Then you place it over the cup, so as to get the proper aim. GENE: Oh-- Oh, I see, professor. Would you mind showing me that little trick again? I'm not a very apt pupil. -I could drown, and you wouldn't care. -Oh, now that isn't true. Here, I'll help you now. I wouldn't use so much sugar in my coffee if I were you. -Why not? -You might get granulated eyelids. [DOG BARKING] -See? Even Babe didn't like that one. -I have something Babe will like. Here you are, Babe. Oh. Babe likes a little finger with her doughnut. -Serves you right. -You know, you're a swell kid. -Glad to hear you say that, mister, because I kind of like you, too. How does it feel to be free again? -Great. And being on parole has its disadvantages. Particularly since one can't marry. -I didn't know you contemplated marriage. -It's all I've been thinking about for the last three years. You can imagine my disappointment when she wasn't there to meet me today. -Who wasn't there? -Why, Claire. Claire Thomas. You remember her. -Yes. Yes. Well, of course. I had no idea you felt that way about her. -She's a swell person. Even if her memory isn't so good. I ought to go see Miller. Feel like going back to work? -Sure. -Let's go. -I didn't expect you back today, Miss Comstock. -My plans have changed. Miss Babbins, this is Mr. Harris. -I'm very glad to know you, Mr. Harris. -Thank you. -Oh, and I present Henry. -How do you do? -Are you Kid Harris? -That's right. -Say, I'd sure like to see you use that right on a couple of guys I know. -Is Mr. Miller in? -Yes. But he's busy. -Who's with him? -Claire Thomas. -Claire Thomas? Oh, excuse me. Uh oh. You'd better stay out here, Babe. I wouldn't want you to get jealous. That a girl. Stay there. Hi there. -Hello, Gene. -Well, greetings. Gee, it's good to see you. -What, no kiss? -Well, I don't like to make a public demonstration. Gene, Gene, please. -I expected you to meet me up there. -Well, you see, I-- -We didn't expect you until tomorrow. I asked Claire to come over so we could plan a rousing welcome. -Then that accounts for your neglect of me. -Yes, yes, of course. -Come on, Babe. I know exactly how you feel. -Well, my boy, your vacation is over. -Suits me, Mr. Miller. I'm ready to go back to work. -I suppose it will take some time for you to get back into condition, eh? -Not at all. While I was on my vacation, I worked out during my spare time. I had a couple of fights, too. -How'd you do, kid? -Fairly well. Dave kept me in pretty good shape. But his only complaint was that I couldn't do any road work. MILLER: [LAUGHTER] -This Dave must be a very amusing character. -He is. I met him when I went up to see Gene. He's got a world of experience in the fight game, and we can always use a good man. He'll be out next week. I arranged his parole, too. And due to the fact that he looked after my interests, I'm going to let him work with Gene. -Take advantage of all this hot copy in Gene's publicity buildup. Well, I think I'll be going. After all, you gentlemen have many things to discuss. -No, there isn't anything we can talk about right now. Dave will be out shortly, and Gene will go into training. And from that time on, he's going to be a pretty busy boy. -Then there's nothing to prevent me taking you home. -Why, of course not, Gene. -I want to thank you sincerely, Mr. Miller, for everything you've done for me. MILLER: I was glad to do it. -Well, so long. -Hope to see you soon, Claire. -Huh, did you Miss me, Babe? -Oh, that's the same mutt you used to have, isn't it? -Yes. Come along. -No, I don't think we'd better take the dog along, had we? -Well, all right. Anything you say. Do me a favor, will you? -Yes, what is it? -Take Babe to Mrs. Durkin's, and tell her I'll be home right after dinner. And you tell her, if she doesn't treat me like a long-lost son, I'm going to scare me up another landlady. -Yes, Mr. Harris. -Thanks. -Oh, come along, Gene. -Thanks, kid. -Don't mention it. -Well, does that guy Harris rate. He's here 10 minutes, and walks off with the boss's gal. -He's welcome to her. -Haven't you anything else to do but discuss Miss Thomas? [BUZZER] -I'll take care of it, Miss Babbins. Yes, Mr. Miller? -Oh, it's you. Is your grandmother better? -About the same, sir. I did everything I could. -I heartily hope she improves. -Thank you. -Now, I want you to call up all the newspapers. Contact the sporting editors, and tell them that Harris is again going to fight under my management. -Yes, sir. -Say, while you're at it, tell the feature writers he's back, too. Gene's hot copy. A major news story. Convict returns to the scene of his crime. -You really want the papers to print that? -Why not? It's good publicity. We'll commercialize on what happened to Sweeney, and everybody and his uncle will want to see that pile-driving right of Gene's. From now on, he'll be known as Killer Harris. What an idea. Will he pull them in with that. -I suppose it would be good business. -You don't approve, eh, Miss Comstock? -Truthfully, no. Perhaps it's because I'm not a very bloodthirsty person. And then again, I was thinking of Gene Harris's feelings in the matter. -Claire, you're the most adorable girl in the whole world. -Sweet of you to say that, Gene. -And I do say it, in spite of the fact that you neglected me terribly while I was away. -It wasn't deliberate, I assure you. I'm probably the most miserable hand at correspondence in captivity. -I wish I had you in captivity. -Serious? -I was never more serious in my life. I love you, Claire. -And I love you too, Gene. -Come on, Babe. Well, Babe, I guess he's forgotten all about us. Oh, Gene. -Why, Mary, what are you doing here? -After you left, I rented a room from Mrs. Durkin. I thought I could help to take care of Babe. -Well that was nice of you. I'm glad you're here. I've got a lot to tell you. She loves me, Mary. She loves me. -It does make a difference, doesn't it? -All the difference in the world. You know, she only wrote to me a few times when I was in there, and when I got out and she didn't meet me, I-- I thought naturally I'd lost the decision. Now I know how she really feels about me. -I hope you find complete happiness. GENE: Thanks, pal. Haven't you ever been in love? -Yes. GENE: Then you know exactly how I feel. -Well, sort of. -Well, I'd better get to bed. This is been a big day for me. I want to thank you again for bringing Babe to meet me. Come on, pup. Night. Goodnight. Come on, pup. We're going to go chase a cat. MARY: Goodnight, Gene. GENE: Goodnight. Say goodnight to the lady. -And then-- and then I told him I loved him. -Did he believe you? -Oh, absolutely. We'd have been married tonight if it hadn't been for his parole. Now I've got to wait seven long years. [LAUGHTER] -How about a little drink, darling? -Not a bad idea, George. You know, my nerves are a little wobbly. After all, Gene Harris is quite an exciting person. -You aren't trying to make me jealous, are you? -You know, I hadn't thought of that, but it isn't a bad idea. -I wouldn't try it if I were you, my dear. -[INAUDIBLE] -That's a good writer. -You approve of it? -Why, certainly. I gave that story to the papers. It's good publicity. -I'd rather not have that kind. I hoped people would sort of forget about that killing. -We might as well understand each other. I'm promoting fights. And nobody's going to tell me how to run my business. -I have no intention of doing that, Mr. Miller. I merely object to being known as a killer. After all, I was unfortunate. I'd like a chance to live it down. Don't you understand? -Now, listen to me. If you want to jeopardize your freedom, just keep on talking. You're a nice boy, and I like you. But you're not in a spot to tell me what to do. -But this killer business-- -All right. We'll go easy on the killer stuff. -Thanks. You know I don't want to go back to the big house. -Now, don't worry. I'll look after your interests. Why, I've already got you a fight. -Swell. You all right, Dave? -Yeah. -Well, you wanted to do road work. -Yeah, but I didn't expect a cross-country run. Say, what state are we in? -Trouble with you is, you can't take it. -Well, as long as you can, I'm satisfied. -You know, it's great to be together again, Dave. -Yeah. Especially out here, where you've got something to look at besides four gray walls. Say, how's that gal Claire coming along? -Ah, fine. She's a great girl. You know, there's nothing in the world like the feeling you're important to someone. -Yeah. It must be swell. -You don't get any mileage on that thumb at all, do you? -No, I guess it just lacks personality. -And a manicure. -Look. Watch the improvement. DAVE: What did I tell you? GENE: Hi, Mary. -Hi yourself. -It's nice of you to drop out, Babe. It's getting to be quite a habit of yours, dragging my dog around. -Well, I didn't think you'd mind. I have a lot of time on me lunch hour, and I heard you telling Mr. Miller you'd be out this way. So here I am. -You don't need to make excuses, Mary. I'm glad to see you. Besides, you can be useful. -How? -I have a hunch my trainer wouldn't mind a ride back to town. -I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I became very popular around here. You're very glad to see me, your trainer wants a ride back to town, and in this basket-- lunch. -I'll vote for you. Oh, uh, Dave, you remember Miss Comstock, don't you? -Why, sure. She works in Miller's office. MARY: How are you, Dave? -Fine, thanks. -You're pretty smart. Bet you can't guess what's in that basket. -Ha-- lunch. That was easy. I overheard you two talking. -Well, you do the honors, will you? Let me help you. -Oh, with pleasure. Exit, canine. Come come come come. Dinner is waiting. I have a very choice table right near the orchestra, madame. -Garcon, you may lead the way. -Oui, madame. [INAUDIBLE] I think you'll find this table just right, madame. A perfect three-point landing. Perfect. -Thank you, garcon. -You know, Babe, I think that guy has got his gals mixed. -My, this is a lovely place, isn't it? Pardon me, but isn't that Mrs. J. Worthington Buckingham over there? -Just a moment and I'll see. I believe it is she. -My, me. How contended she looks. -It's the climate. -Hey, are you two punch-drunk? [LAUGHTER] -If I may be so rude as to interrupt, may I suggest that chow is served? -We're in a [INAUDIBLE] condition, sir. -Ah, ah, ah-- -I'm glad to hear that. This Murphy is a pretty tough boy. -Why, don't worry, Mr. Miller. We can take him. -You'd better run on home, Gene, get some rest. Tonight is your big night. If you beat Murphy, I can get you a fight with Knockout Reilly. -That's something to look forward to. -The best of luck. -Thanks. -See you after the fight. -I want to wish you lots of luck, Mr. Harris. -Thank you. --[INAUDIBLE] you're gonna knock the [INAUDIBLE] right out of him, killer. -Button up your mouth, kid. -All I can say is, I'll be there trying. -I'll be rooting for you, Gene. -I know you will. -Take it easy now, Murphy. A little hot. -How do you feel, Dynamite? -All right, boss. But I wish this fight was over. -Afraid? -Sweeny was a pretty good friend of mine. If the wife wasn't going to have a baby I didn't need the dough, I wouldn't let Harris take a crack at my chin. MANAGER: Bert. -Yeah? MANAGER: You finished there? -I will be. In a minute. Relax. -Too bad the dog can't see you fight. -That's all right. I'll tell her about it later. Looks like she's got a little fight on her hands as it is. -Time for windup. You'd better get ready. -Right. -I'll be right back, Mr. Graham. -Where are you going? -I got something I want to do. -You'd better stick around. The fight might be over before you get back. -Ladies and gentlemen. [INAUDIBLE] evening. The main event. At 15 rounds or less. In this corner, Dynamite Murphy, at 176 pounds. In this corner, Killer Harris, 166 pounds. ANNOUNCER: Time-keeper, Billy McCall. Referee, John Halligan. [BUZZER] -[INAUDIBLE] Dynamite. -Don't forget to let go with that right. -Now sparring in the middle of the ring. Harris leads with a left, which is blocked by Murphy, who retaliates with a left hook to the body. They clinch. -I think your husband's going to win, Miss Murphy. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): The referee separates them. Murphy gets in a terrific left hook to the body, and two great rights to the chest. -[INAUDIBLE] go, [INAUDIBLE]. -You did swell. -Yeah. I'll have to take it easy in the next round. -Why? You're not tired, are you? -No, I'm all right. I'll snap out of it. -Why, sure. He never laid a glove on you. -Come on now, kid. Snap out of it. -I'll get him in this next round. -You know, Murphy looks tired. -Yeah. -Has he got any sock? -Nothing to worry about. But he's acting kind of funny. -Yeah. [BUZZER] -Murphy is down from a left to the jaw. The referee sends Harris to the other corner. He's now counting. One, two, three. Murphy is flat on his back. Why, his face is white as a ghost. Then referee has stopped counting. Murphy is out cold. -[INAUDIBLE] -If anything should happen to him, I just couldn't stand it. -This man is dead. -Are you sure, doc? I don't see how it could have happened. DOCTOR: Well, it has. -All right, it was an accident. But knowing you had a deadly right, you should have given up fighting. -Captain, I didn't hit him hard enough to knock him out, let alone kill him. POLICE CAPTAIN: But the fact that Murphy is dead proves that you were wrong. -But Murphy must have been sunk. -You aren't going to hold Harris, are you? POLICE CAPTAIN: The coroner's inquest will decide that. -Come on, Claire. I'm going to take you home. -All right, Gene. -Dave, will you see Mary home? -Sure. -Thanks. -Gosh. I forgot all about Babe. -Oh, she's in your dressing room. -Yes, I know, but-- do you mind if we pick her up? -Well, you see, Gene-- -I'll get her, Gene, and take her home. -That'll be swell. Thanks a lot. -Don't mention it. Is there anything else, Mr. Miller? -No, I think not. Anyway, I want to talk to the captain. -Goodnight. -Uh, by the way, how is Mrs. J. Worthington Buckingham coming along? Heh heh, come on now, buck out of it. GENE: Well, can you imagine that? Now what are we going to do? CLAIRE: Must be a watchman around someplace. GENE: I'll see if I can wake him up. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -I'm Harris's trainer. He left something in his dressing room we'd like to get. -All right. -Babe? -Here, Babe. Here, Babe. -I wonder where she went. -Say, that's funny. [INAUDIBLE] that dog when I came in here to get Gene's clothes. [WHINING] -What's that? -That's Babe. It came from one of the other dressing rooms. [DOG WHINING] -Babe? Babe? [WHINING] Why, she's sick. -Is there a veterinarian around here? -One about six blocks down the street. -If we hurry, maybe we can save her. -This thing's got me puzzled. I hardly touched him. -I think you're worrying unnecessarily. The whole thing will be straightened out in a day or two. -I'm not worrying about myself. It's about Murphy and his family. -I think I'll see if that coffee's done. It might help your nerves. found a few doughnuts in the pantry. Remembering your weakness for them, I thought you might like one. Cream and sugar? -No, thanks. Isn't it funny, Claire, how you can plan your whole existence, and then suddenly something unforeseen occurs, and kicks the props right out from under you. -Yeah. Life is like that. Have a doughnut. -Thanks. -Oh, come on, Gene. Snap out of it. -Sorry. -What are you thinking about now? -I don't see there's a chance of saving her. -Oh, but you must. -I'll do everything I can. Maybe if I could get the poison out of her system. -You know, if anything happened to Babe, it'd just about kill Gene. -I'd better phone him. -You think he's still at Claire Thomas's? -I'll see. -Do you know her number? -Yes. I've called it many times for Mr. Miller. [PHONE RINGING] -Excuse me. -Certainly. -This is Miss Thomas speaking. Oh, yes. Yes, he's here. Just a minute, I'll call him. Miss Comstock is on the telephone. She wants to talk to you. -Funny, I was just thinking of her. -Thank you. Hello, Mary. What? Poison? In Murphy's dressing room? -Yes. I don't know how it happened. VETERINARIAN: There isn't any hope. -Please, hurry, Gene. -Where are you? I'll be right over. Babe's been poisoned. -Yes. I gathered that from the conversation. -Want to come along? -Well, I don't think I'd better. You see-- -I'll call you later then. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -I've been trying to get in touch with you. -Yeah, it looks that way. I just saw Harris leave. -Listen, Bert. This is no time to be jealous. His dog has just been poisoned. -Ha! Well ain't that too bad. -I'm afraid it is. You see, the dog was found in Murphy's dressing room. -What? -What did you do with the stuff you put on Murphy? -Why, I used it all up. -You applied it with a towel? -Sure. -Did they find it? -Now don't tell me you didn't get rid of that towel! -Well I didn't get the chance. Graham wouldn't let me out of his sight a minute. Maybe I'd better go back and find it. -Don't be silly. -That would only leave you open for a lot of questions. -Well what are we going to do? -The thing for you to do is casually drop over there in the morning. Meantime, how about a cup of coffee? -Well, I could go for that. -Well? -She's dead. -This is just one time you've got to stick up your chin and take it. -Yeah. It's getting calloused. Now, it I could just find the person responsible for this, I'd-- Say, I'd like to have a look around Murphy's dressing room. -I'm afraid that wouldn't do any good. -Maybe not, but I'd like to do it just the same. -Want company? -Yeah. I want to thank you for your efforts, doctor. -I know how a mutt like this gets under your skin. I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do. -You'll take care of her? -Yes. -Thanks. -Are you falling for this Harris kid? -Why, of course not, Bert. You're the only man who interests me. -You're not kidding me, are you? Don't forget I spotted you with Miller last week. -That's just part of the game, Bert. -Well, you'd better be on the level with me. I'd certainly be a sucker for taking care of Murphy and Sweeny for you, only to have you give me the runaround. -Now, don't be childish. If I can clean up as much on the next fight as I did on Murphy's, I'll have a quarter of a million dollars. -Gee. A quarter of a million. Maybe you only bet on sure things, huh? -Right. That's why I bet on you. [KNOCK ON DOOR] MARY: Sorry to bother you again. WATCHMAN: Oh, that's all right. How's the dog? MARY: She died. WATCHMAN: Well that's too bad. GENE: Mind if we look around? WATCHMAN: Why, no. Just come right on in. GENE: Thank you. Was there anyone here before these two people came back this evening? -Not after they took Murphy out of here. I guess Babe was just accidentally poisoned. -She was lying right on that towel. Be careful. -What good is that going to do? -I don't know. Just a hunch. We might be able to find out why Murphy tired this evening. -You don't think-- -I don't know what to think, Mary. I'm going to take this to police headquarters and find out. -Is there anything else that I could do? GENE: No, thank you. -Well. -Harris claims he didn't his Murphy hard enough to hurt him. He feels that Murphy was poisoned too. -That would be the most satisfactory answer in tonight's tragedy, as far as you're concerned. But there's one drawback. The autopsy showed the evidence of poison. -What's your decision as to the cause of his death? -Heart failure. -It isn't that I want to get out of anything, coroner, but I'm positive Murphy was not himself this evening. -Probably he was in poor condition. -No, it wasn't that either. Doctor, do you know of any poison that might be applied externally, and not take effect until, say, half an hour or so later? -Yes, there are several. But as I said before, there was no evidence. Wait a minute. I read about a poison that's taken from a Chinese herb and kills when applied externally, and evaporates through the bloodstream. -Well then, suppose an animal got hold of it, took it internally, and would it leave a trace in its body? -Yes, that's a peculiar part of it. -Then Claire Thomas can help us. She's been to China. One of her best friends is a Chinese physician. -We can check with her in the morning. -Captain, I wish you'd square me with the parole board, and have tonight's accident judged a knockout. -I don't understand. -I think we have a pretty good idea of what killed Murphy. -I wouldn't be surprised if Sweeny got his the same way. -Mr. Miller's promised me a fight with Knockout Reilly I'd like to go through with that fight, and in the meantime, we could keep our eyes open. -Well, how about Reilly? Aren't you placing him on a dangerous spot? -We'll have to take every precaution. -May I make a suggestion? -Yes, of course. -Well, I wouldn't say anything about this to Mr. Miller, or even Miss Thomas. -Are you suspicious? -No. Only, we shouldn't let any more people in one our secret than is necessary. -That sounds sensible to me. -I wouldn't miss the Harris fight for anything in the world. -Why, Reilly has got plenty of nerve, all right. -Boy, I'll say he has. -Do you realize Harris is the odds-on favorite? -What for? He hasn't been in training. He's in no shape. -No, but he's got that right hand-- -Yes, but he never throws it. He never throws it. -He doesn't. Wait until you see him fight. -This fight should be stopped. -Maybe if we girls get together, we can prevent another death in the ring. -We must. -Well, you won't have cause to be jealous of Harris much longer. -No? Why? -I'm putting you in his camp. -I met Mr. McNamee through his sister. -Why, I'm glad to have you take an interest in my business, Claire. -Miss Thomas convinced me that I'd have more of a chance with you than with Graham. -I've got the biggest attraction in the prize ring. Of course, I'm sorry he killed those fighters. But I guess it's in-- in the game after all. -Ah, it sure is. -How'd you like to be in Harris's corner, the night of the fight? -Say, I'd like nothing better. -I can offer you $200 a month, and your expenses. -It's a deal. Sold. -Hi, Mary. -Hello, Dave. -How's Gene? -Swell. -Say, you talk as if you hadn't seen him for a long time. -Well, it's been an hour and a half. -I don't know how you stand it. -Say, wouldn't it be swell if we could prove that Sweeny was poisoned too? -Oh, gee, Dave. That would make me so happy. -You know, if Gene was pardoned, he could marry. -Hi, Dave. -Hi. What's he doing here? -Mr. Miller just hired him. He's going to be in Gene's corner. -That's funny. -Something wrong? -Nothing that we can't work out. -You haven't got much time, Dave. Tomorrow night's the fight. -By that time, we'll be all set. -Ladies and gentlemen. We have with us tonight your 15-round delight. In this corner, the boy with the sensational right hand, Killer Harris. And the light heavyweight contender of the world, Kayo Reilly, at 174. -[INAUDIBLE] -I ain't afraid of him. -How do you feel, kid? -All right, I guess. [BOXING BELL] -[INAUDIBLE] Shoot that right! [BOXING BELL] -Listen, kid. Don't be afraid to do what I tell you. Use that right. Hit him with the left, and then let your right go right on the button, see? [BUZZER] -Come on! Kid! Keep punching! -Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and out. -Come on, doc. -This man is dead. -Boy, this is tough. -He was one of the best fighters I ever had. -Well, I guess there's nothing else I can do. MARY: [CRYING] DAVE: It's just one of those things that happen. MARY: Yes, I suppose so. Oh. -Give me a hand, will you, Mr. Miller? -Sure. -I hope you got rid of the towel this time. -Ah don't worry. I got it in my satchel. Say, it took longer to put that guy out than it did Sweeny and Murphy put together. [SCREAM] -I had no idea you were connected with this, Claire. And Harris. The poison. Dave substituted alcohol. -Let's get out of here. POLICEMAN: Wait a minute. Come on, let's go. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] -I'd give anything to have her back. -She'd be happy if she knew how much she has done for you. Cleared your name, secured your pardon. -I guess you're right. -You know, if it hadn't been for all this, you two might not have gotten together. -Maybe Dave's right. At least, we'll always think so, won't we?
