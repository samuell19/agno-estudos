Face that way. Danek, look this way. - Are you asleep? - I can't sleep. So, did you go over yesterday? I did. So what did you get up to? We talked and stuff like that. And did he kiss you? - Actually he did. - Where? Right here. Where? I can't see. You know, here. Oh, I get it. And how was it? It was gentle. He's very gentle. And kind. I'm seeing him again tomorrow. I see. Are you looking forward to it? I really am. I might go to sleep now. Good night, then. INNOCENCE Good morning, children. I'm Dr Arms-And-Legs. First, I need to count how many of you are here. Here we go. One, two, three, eight, nine, ten, eleven, fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two, sixty-eight exactly. - Jaundice, anyone? - Me. One jaundice coming up. How about a scarlet fever? There you go. Let me hear what you're thinking. I couldn't say out loud what you're thinking about! When I break my arm and it swings like this, I just straighten it up and make it stay there. And while I'm here, I just might... go for a little swim, if you don't mind. Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor. - Hello, Mrs Pokorna. Come in, Olinka. Lida! Yeah? I'm still getting changed. - How did you get on today? - Not too bad. - It's always a full house here. - I know. Put that in for me. That's what Dad always says. That this is the only audience for me because they can't get away. She needs to realise that the same thing could happen to other girls. That's why we need her cooperation. She won't say any more. She's so young and still a minor. She's glad to be here. She feels safe here. Unlike out there. Don't take it so much to heart. Want a gummy bear? It's the last one. So? - Can it be fixed? - Yes. Use this screwdriver to push it inside. Look how many screws are left over! The radio won't play if we don't put them in. - I can't... - Use the other one. Hello. You're still here? - Running late? - I will be. I can take him for you. - That would be great. - Hi, Danek. - No, no, no. - Yes. - By car. - Okay. Let's pack you a snack. What would you like to drink? Milk. You can go with Auntie now. - We'll go by car. - I'll get his tablet. - Wait, we'll get your tablet. - No, no, no. Bye-bye now. Be good. Thank you. See you. Thanks. Who's that? Where am I? Here I am. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Danek. Hello. - Where's Milada? - At work. I don't mind. - Bye, Danek. - Thanks. - See you. - Bye, Danek. What will we do? - Hello. - Hello, Bodie. I mean, Doyle. - I can't remember who's who. - Coffee? No, thank you. See you later. Bye. Let's go. - What's wrong? - By car. Okay, but I'll do the driving. Let's go. Hang on, we have to take our stuff. I'll take your bag. See you. - By car. - Sure. Let's go. - On foot? - By car. - See you, guys. - Bye. Is there any wine left, little clown? - Have a look. - Sure, Dad. - Anybody else want something? - No, thanks. Cheers! What is it? You want to call Mum? Is that it? There you go. I've put your story on. I'll pick this up. Good night. Sleep tight. It's time for bed. See you. What is this? It's potato salad. You like it. Why does it have peas in it? Tereza likes peas. Sorry, I forgot Mum never put them in. I can take them out. - I'm not a child. - I'll cut it for you. - If it's tough I won't have it. - It's tender chicken. What's new at the hospital, Tomas? How do you mean? How about Dr Simek? Has he been promoted yet? Do you mean Professor Lebeda? Dr Simek died two years ago. Remember his funeral? How badly his daughter-in-law played the violin? - Violin? - Yeah. It's terrible how much this crown bothers me. Every mouthful is torture. And we're a family of doctors. You should have been a dentist, not a clown. At least I work in a hospital. That's the worst part of it. The shame of it all made you go grey. You could have been somebody like your sister or Tomas over here. - Tereza will be a doctor. - Come on, Granddad. I've made my will, you know. If you get into medicine you'll inherit the lot. And my brother? You'll have to look after him. - Thanks a lot. - Tereza... - I want to be a vet. - What's that? By the way, Mum, I hope Dan won't be back. No, he'll stay with Lada. - He bothers you? - I don't like him around my friends. - Why? - He hangs around. Who's that? Do we have to talk about it now in front of Dad? I'll get it. Hello. Happy birthday. Thanks. - Hello, Danek. - Hello. - I'm sorry he's back early. - That's all right. - Come. - Come in. You said tomorrow. I got a call from work. They need me. Sorry. - Has he eaten? - A snack bar. Okay. Thanks. - Hello, Danek. Hi there. - Hello, pal. - Want a schnitzel? - No. Really? And some salad? You said he wouldn't be here today. Lada had to go to work. I don't care. It's my fifteenth birthday. What can I do? - Should I cancel? - He's your brother. Don't worry. We'll manage somehow. We'll entertain him and you'll have fun. - Wine. - You'll have wine with Granddad? - Wine... - Is that it? - What will your giraffe have? - Wine. Police! Get down! Hands behind you! - I said behind you! - Cuff them. Lie still, gentlemen. Nice and still. - Good morning. - Hello. Excellent! My compliments. Let's go... Excellent! Good work, girls. Stick to the green. Keep going, keep going! Brief and empty, the days before we met. My successor will not surpass me. Ariadne. Excellent work! My compliments. I'm the winner! Let's start again. Great move. In case you're getting cold, I have the sauna on. I'm going to make a wish. Tereza, we love you very much. All the best and allow me to... What's wrong? Too wet? - How long have you been here? - Not long. - Still partying? - No. Lida's working and the girls went bowling. Danek is asleep. I didn't expect you. Come in for a coffee. Tomas has gone to the hospital. I see. A coffee is just what I need. Thanks. Do you need a gardener? I miss the garden. Are you seeing anyone? Do they mind ants in their sleeping bag? No. I don't want to disgust anyone again. You felt embarrassed when I played the guitar. Or played volleyball. Have you been away lately? Not for a long time. The guys are married, they work. They go on family holidays. You look good. Are you happy? Doing well together, aren't you? Look, Lada... from now on, we'll pick up Dan from school ourselves. You don't mind seeing me, do you? He minds, right? - Will you wake Danek? - Sure. Do you want me to carry it? How about two the same? Are there any? Good. Mine's electric. Let's go. I'm coming with you. Exactly. Come on. - Hello. - Hello. Here's his bag. - His mum will pick him up. - I'll make a note. - Or her husband. - Fine. - See you. - Say bye-bye. How about a hug? Goodbye. Hello, Lada. - Hello. - I'm glad you're here. I'll give you a hand. Need a lift? - To the station would be good. - What's in here? Are you seeing anyone? How did it go today? Good. I captured their attention... then they applauded... It was good. I'm not. And you? Neither am I. But I don't mind. Neither do I. Have you been reading my emails? "I didn't ask you anything. "I took your head and pulled it to my breasts. "I offered you my nipples "and placed your hand inside my panties "so you could feel how much I wanted you." - What is that? - I don't know. So you don't know who it's from? I really don't. Does it sound like she doesn't know you? Or is she trying to get to know you? Well, it must be some kind of joke. "Sheltered by leaves, in the scent of darkness, two forces united. "A white stream entered the quiet of my underbelly. Ariadne." What nonsense. Who is that? Ariadne, King Minos' daughter who gave Theseus a ball of wool... Stop it. I really don't know who it's from. "My dear, little, unrepeatable, from the start unbeatable, "undeceivable seller of rain. "My great and small totally defeated victor, "break into me, fire the charge and raid my insides. "Glue me down finally like a stamp. "Lick me like a postage stamp. "Stick me where I belong. - "Don't ask whether you may..." - Come here, Milada. Don't be silly. This is stupid. It's nonsense. Lift your leg. Straighten your legs. Olinka, I'm sorry to say this but it looks like we have to part. Your leg has healed beautifully. It shouldn't feel any different now. If we continue your rehabilitation as we've been doing, the pain will disappear as well. - Any pain? - No. - I don't want to go home. - You don't? - This doesn't hurt? - No. You prefer to be in a room with little kids who watch the same fairytale over and over? - Any pain? - No. I want to stay here. My leg is still sore. You did have a compound fracture, twice reset. It will hurt from time to time. I hate it at home. What are you saying? What would your mum think? I don't want to go home. I'm scared to go home. But you weren't scared of the operation. It's my mum. You're afraid of your mum? I didn't fall out of a tree. - She made that up. - Just a minute. Why would she do that? Because she threw me down the stairs. I don't want to go home. I'm scared she'll do it again. Go to your room now and wait there. The doctor and I need to talk. But I want to stay. We'll have a chat and see what we can do, okay? Off you go, Princess. She's lying. - You think she made that up? - It's all lies. - None of it is true. - Really? She's been telling me some incredible stories. She'll be a writer. She has talent. She wrote something and gave it to me to read. - About some Ariadne. - Who? That's what she calls herself in the stories she writes. That's what she does. - Doctor... - Hello. I know it's not much but please accept this. - You shouldn't have. - You did a fantastic job. She walks beautifully. She's told me how kind you all were, how much you've helped her. - I don't know how to thank you. - Thank you. Betyna! - You have golden hands. - Mrs Pokorna... Could I have a word with Olinka? - Is anything wrong? - It's just a formality. Come with me. Here's something for you. Something little. It smells lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Why are you doing this? Would you like to explain? - Why do you write to me? - I don't. Haven't you written to me? - So it wasn't you. - No. I see. It wasn't you, it was Ariadne, right? Who's that? You will stop writing to me. No more letters from Ariadne. Understood? One more letter and there'll be trouble. Now get going. I don't want you here again. Get out. Are you joking? I can't do that. It's no joke. You can do it. We'll get something to eat and we can talk. But I know them. I'm not impartial. It's not against the law. You're a policeman, not a judge. That doesn't make it right. I've known you for eighteen years. So what? We're friends and I won't force you into anything but I can still call you an idiot. Have you forgotten what that guy did to you? He cheated on you when you were barely in the door. He screwed your wife, got her pregnant and moved into your place. You were left with your handicapped son. Am I wrong? You were friends, childhood buddies, and he does that to you? It wasn't illegal but he did rob and humiliate you. Lada, he pissed and spat on your entire life. That was fifteen years ago and you're still not over it. Do I need to tell you whose photo is in your wallet? It's our chance to get him. He can't lie his way out of the facts we have. It's fate. You know what? Make it my birthday present. Take this case on as a gift to me. Is it your birthday? Today? Yes. - Why aren't you with your family? - Neither of us could be stuffed. What will it be? Will you take it? Come on. Another half hour or so. - The open diary was on her bed? - Yes. - So you read it and rang us. - Yes. Did you notice any change in Olinka during the time she was hospitalised? Before she went in she seemed more infantile. Now she's more grown up. In the past, has she ever fallen in love with an older man such as a teacher or even your partner? Definitely not. The two of us have always been like best friends. She used to tell me everything. She would have said something and in any case, I never bring anyone home. We live alone. So you had no secrets. - No. - It's the first one. - That's her computer? - Yes. Can I see? - Sure. - Make a recording. Glue me down finally like a stamp. Lick me like a postage stamp. Stick me where I belong and don't ask whether you may. To embrace and not run away. To kiss your eyes, the palms of your hands, your wings. To have no fear of sailing through your tropical zone. To fit into you like a page in a book and allow myself to be printed on both sides. To fall into you, to flow through you, to become one stream. That's what I'm afraid of. That's what I want. Come and sit down. - He'll be right here. - Thank you. This is Dr Blahova, a psychologist. Take a seat. Would you like a drink? There we go. You said that you and Dr Kotva had been alone together at his home. - Is that true? - Yes. So you'd be able to describe the house? Yes. - Hello. - Hello. Major Bares, criminal police. Mrs Kotva? Yes. Your husband has been accused of the sexual abuse of a minor. We need to search the scene of the crime. Can we come in? - Can I call him? - Sure. If he doesn't agree to it we'll get a warrant. The outcome will be the same. Who hadn't switched off their phone? It's me, actually. Please excuse me. Come in. - Hello. - Hello. What's meant to have taken place here? Do you have a pool? This way. - Excuse me, Doctor. - What is it? The police are here. They're in my office. I see. Can you take over, please? Doctor, could you please... My attendance. Thanks. I often used to say look here, it can't be done. You can't just... - Hello. What's happening? - Hello. It's nothing, don't worry. We're not sure yet. - Is Lida at home? - She's out with Grandad. Tomas? The house is full of cops. Listen to me. I'm at a police station, under arrest. The whole thing is pure nonsense. I'll call you when I can. I have to hand in my phone. Maybe you can call Lada. I don't have to. He's the one in charge here. Turn to your left and look at the wall. So... We'll hang on to Olinka's computer and diary as evidence. We played table tennis and used the pool. - The sauna as well? - Um... Were you naked or wearing swimmers? We had our swimmers on. - Did he bring any alcohol? - No, juice. Juice... And did he try to touch you? What can you tell me? Could she be a compulsive liar? It's hard for me to say. I didn't know her that well. - Were there any family problems? - No. - Did she talk about him often? - Yes. - Every night. - Every night? - Was she in love with him? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yeah. Was she the only one you brought to your place or are we going to find out that there were lots of others? Olinka has never been inside the house. It's all nonsense. She told us she'd been inside and knows the place. - Do you know this place? - Yes. Excuse me for a moment... I asked you to stay upstairs, please. Thanks. Yes, I know it. Were you only down here or upstairs as well? - Only down here. - Only here... I note that from her position the victim can't see the living area. Olinka, could you describe the living room? What's on the right and what's on the left? On the right is the kitchen and a raised floor with a bookshelf. On the left side is a window with a view to the pool. Let's go inside. I can say that on the right is the kitchen as described by the victim. Beyond is a raised floor containing bookshelves as the victim said. Let's go on. What time was it when Dr Kotva brought you here? Midday. He didn't bring me, I came by myself. That was before my second operation. The hospital was being painted so all treatments were moved. Was anyone else at home? We were alone. - What happened next? - He told me to sit down. Where? Where did the doctor sit? Here as well. Peter, can you sit there? What happened next? Tomas... I mean, the doctor... asked if I wanted a drink. And then he wanted to have a look at me. - Have a look at what? - As usual, the way I walk. - Show us how. - You want to see? Yes. Hang on. Were you meant to get undressed? Sure. So he could see how my leg, spine and hip were doing. How far did you have to undress? To my underpants. You don't need to get undressed. So you had to walk for him. Show us how. What happened next? Then we did the therapy. The same as always or something different? Well... He asked me to have a shower first. I see. And then it was the usual. - No. - So it wasn't like at the hospital? Was it different? It's important. - It doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. We need to know whether the therapy was different. Different from the hospital therapy. Tomas didn't hurt me in any way. It was beautiful. Wonderful. Tomas loves me and I love him. Good... So what was so beautiful, so wonderful? Describe it for us. Did you hear what I said? Inspector, I think that's enough for one day. I suggest we leave it there. Excuse me, just one more question. Can you describe the bathroom where you allegedly had the shower? Yes. Grey tiles, white marble floor, dots on the shower curtain, a mirror. Examination fully confirmed the foregoing statement of the victim. Hello. Lada, what's going on here? Please refer to the court order I gave you. We're here to verify a witness statement. I mean a victim's statement. - That's all we can tell you. - Is she the victim? - Who's responsible? - You're asking? If you don't know, then I feel very sorry for you. Ask her who's been sending crazy emails to Tomas using the name Ariadne. Please calm down. Naturally we know about the emails. - Have you been checking on us? - No, that's not my job. When we're done with Olinka you'll have your say. Are you saying you're taking her seriously? She's mentally ill. She's not the one who's sick. Lada, wait here with Mrs Pokorna. Mrs Kotva, let's continue. On no account are you to come back with Dad. He mustn't find out. Okay? Fine. Bye. See you. I wouldn't mind going home. A bit further. Walking is good for you. I know, but... And in her hand she held a cup. Ah, my dear girl said the beggar woman, I'm so hungry. I haven't had a morsel of bread since this morning. Would you give me a little bit of your bread? "Why ever not" said the girl. You can have the whole lot, I don't have far to go. A doctor needing social isolation. Hello. - Sorry to turn up so late. - No problem. Can I come in for a minute? Sure, come in. I didn't come here alone. Can both of us come in? Come in. Thank you. Hello. - Would you like some coffee? - No, thanks. We came... We came because Milada thinks the investigation might have been started for personal reasons. I didn't ask to be involved. I don't believe you. Do you think I reported him? Now he's under arrest so he can't influence any witnesses. - I can't fix that. - As if you would have! I had no choice in the matter. That's not true. I know him. But I never took you for a stubborn, pathetic, vengeful sod. Take it easy, Milada. Can you imagine how we feel? What Tereza is going through? We haven't told Dad yet. Until things blow over, we're saying Tomas is away. As a psychologist, you can... No, no, he's a cop. Just an ordinary cop. You know Tomas, you know he wouldn't do a such a thing. We all think we know other people. Our friends, our wives... But Tomas... He's a rehabilitation physician, a doctor. He comes in contact with a lot of children. And teenagers. He has to touch them. It's part of his work. I often go to his place of work. I see what he achieves with them. If Tomas ends up in prison our whole family will simply fall apart. You just can't let a crazy girl do something like that. What an opportunity, right? To do what? The work... The work of a rehabilitation physician involves touching his patients. He needs to touch them all over to get them moving again, to get them walking. To make them well again. He can't be worried that one of his patients might be a nutcase who falls in love and makes up stories. That's how it is. That never occurred to you, did it? Why did we even come? The girl is lying. You do know that, don't you? - She's lying. - It's not for me to say. You wouldn't believe the cases I have to deal with every day. Fathers who... Never mind. My job is simply to validate statements. What are you playing at? What's with the pathetic legalese? For fifteen years I've been trying to finally get you out of my life while you've been looking for cracks to seep back in. You're the nutcase here. You should get help. I might talk like a lawyer but I'm not one. I'm just a dumb detective who happens to have to deal with conflicting statements. I can't help it if the girl insists on her version. If she's lying, which I tend to believe, and she has no witnesses, then it can't... Do you cops ever take into account the statements of the wives of unjustly accused men or only those of psychopaths and their mothers? Do you? Well, I can give you one. Tomas is a normal, healthy man who engages in normal, satisfying sexual activity. I should know. - Do you understand me? - Perfectly. I'll go on just to make sure you do. For a long time I had no idea how wonderful good sex can be. It didn't do a thing for me. "Really? Is that it? "Is this what makes the world go round?" I used to think I wasn't normal, that I had some problem. And then I met Tomas. A normal, healthy man who knew what to do with me. So that's what he did. And at least a thousand times since. And each time I say, thank God for that. Thank God for that. Congratulations. Let me sum up. Nobody can provide a more expert assessment regarding the sexual behaviour of Dr Kotva. That's good. What is? To have such an expert assessment. Can't you see it? Has it ever occurred to you that it could be an advantage to have me on the case? That I won't allow false rumours to leak out. That I'll keep an eye on what should be considered proof. I told you. I apologise on her behalf. She's desperate. She didn't mean it. Do you think... the girl... is honest and you believe her? I don't know. I'd like not to believe her. Are you saying that you think Tomas did it? See you later. See you. Come in, Olinka. You can come too, Mrs Pokorna. Hello. The public prosecutor and the defendant's legal representative. Lada, you take Olinka. Mrs Pokorna, you stay here. Let's go. Well Olinka... Let's finally untangle the string and get out of this labyrinth. Agreed? Let me read you something. "I didn't ask you anything. "I took your head and pulled it to my breasts. "I offered you my nipples "and placed your hand inside my panties "so you could feel how much I wanted you. "I used my tongue to taste every enticing part of you." As far as we know you made five such annotations. Six, including this one. Does that mean you and Dr Kotva, or Tomas, as you call him, made love on six occasions? No. So how many times? I can't remember. Can't remember how often, or if ever? I can't remember how many times. Can you tell me what it means to make love? You don't know? Imagine I'm a child or an extraterrestrial and I don't know what people in love do. That's crazy. Are you five years old? If you can't tell me, I can get someone else. I don't know how to say it. Intercourse? That's just a word. It can mean many different things. If I say "a table", you imagine a table, right? If I say "a fairytale", I could mean a lie. I will now say something on the basis of what you wrote. I don't want to say it but I have to. And I'll say it in the way people will speak in the courtroom. So... Do you claim that Tomas repeatedly penetrated you with his sex organ and had intercourse with you? That's disgusting. Answer me. Is this how you'd describe making love to your wife? As intercourse? Olinka, I'm trying to help you. Simply say "yes" or "no". Then no. That's not what we did. We made love and that's something else. I'll tell you what's something else. Something else is a caress or a kiss. That's different. A cuddle is also something else. But Olinka, all that is hugely different from... Olinka... This is your last chance to take it all back. I promise everything will be okay. Yes. We did do it. And I wanted it to happen. Fine. But the thing is, you're fourteen. You're still a minor. And three quarters. Fourteen and three quarters. So now it's a crime but it won't be in September? Exactly. Where will you dump me? Into some psych unit? I don't know. So? Did it happen? Repeatedly? Is that your final word? - Do you know what this is? - Paper. It's a medical report. Your medical report. - Do you know what it says? - No. It says that you've never made love. Not with Dr Kotva, nor with anyone else. That's good. - What is? - That you think that. It's not what I think. It's what I know. And now I know that you're making it up. - Tell me why. - They'll let Tomas go? - So now you care? - Can I see him? I doubt he'd want to see you. We'll see about that. You need your bottom spanked. But unfortunately I can't do that. My naked bottom? I don't know. There's no reason to hold him any longer. I recommend release. You have one expert report but I have another. But she's a virgin. It's all absurd. Don't do this for me. According to my expert there's another possibility. It's unlikely, but it exists. If a guy has a very short wick and the girl's hymen is deep inside and it's firm, no defloration occurs and a doctor would know that. And as you know, sexual abuse isn't limited to penetration. It would've been mentioned. - But he was never examined. - Why not? - He did loads of tests. - But nobody measured him. You want to measure his dick? When really, as the victim of some liar's obsession, he deserves an apology? This came from the public prosecutor. If it's longer than mine, which is likely, he's off the hook. I'd never forgive him if he did it to me. Why are you worrying about his forgiving you anything? Fine, do it. Just get him home by tonight. Think about this. Clearly, she knows the house because she's been there. Had she been seen he'd have a witness. But nobody saw her. How can you explain that? But the whole thing is nonsense. We know it and the others will too. - And if it isn't? - What? What if it isn't all nonsense? What are you saying? - Tomas has been acting strangely. - How? He's been visiting those obscene websites. They're just pictures. Guys get off and it's over with. He hardly sleeps with me now. What's "hardly"? I can't remember the last time. That doesn't mean anything. I told him it wasn't appropriate to go in the sauna with Tereza and her friends. You know what you're saying? He's a doctor. He looks at nudity differently than the rest of us. Maybe he's going through a mid-life crisis and he's too embarrassed to tell you. Or he's over-worked or under a lot of stress. All men go through it at that age. I guarantee Tomas is above board. He's above board. You're going through a nightmare and any wife in your situation would do the same. But it ends there. You've faced it and that's that. Now erase it. How do you know? How can you be so sure? How can you give guarantees? Because I know Tomas. He's simply Tomas. But you have no experience with men. You're afraid of them. I'm sorry. Thanks. Where did you say Tomas went? To Japan. You see, if you wouldn't play a clown you could have gone too. I know. Next, please. Hello. This is never a pleasant situation. It's made easier by the fact that we're both doctors and understand the consequences. - True. - Good. There are two options for stimulation should you need it. - Photos and a video. - Thanks. I need to measure you at rest and then erect. I see you don't get bored around here. I'll have to take the measurements. - Hello. - Hello, Lada. - Coming in? - No. I'm here officially. A girl from Tereza's class has run away from home. Why are you shouting? I can hear. Sorry. - I wonder if you've seen her. - What's that? - Have you seen her? - This one? No... Hang on. She's been here. - Hello. - Hello. Is Dr Kotva at home? Tereza, you have a visitor. There's nobody at home. Did you need something? She needed to use the toilet. So you let her inside? Of course. Radka... Sixteen. Slightly above average so everything seems to be okay. You're out of trouble. Congratulations. She got scared about what she'd started and just started fibbing. Why do you think she did it? She's compensating for not having a father around. She denies reality and creates her own. It's a classic example of transference. Just because you helped her. A man being kind to her was something she wasn't used to. If you have experience with such cases why did you believe her? Liars like her can be very convincing. They live in their altered reality for years. I'm sorry. Are you looking for someone? You have to tell me about it. I'm really interested. He's tired, he'll tell you tomorrow. - Very well. - I'll get it ready. Hey! - It's a party! - What? We're having a party. What are you doing up there? What? Why are you doing that? We've looked forward to you coming home so much that now we're going to have a party. Stop it. Come on. Stop it. Did you hear me? I'm just so happy that you're innocent. - Stop it. - And that it wasn't true. - Go to bed. - Why should I? - Go. - Why? Dad's asleep. - Go to bed. - Go yourself. - Tereza! - What? - Go to bed. - Okay. Listen, Zdravko... It doesn't look good. The girl found in your bathroom... It seems you're responsible. She was fifteen. I'm hungry. It's my right to be given food. There you are. Last time it needed salt, didn't it? Oh, God. Sorry about that. Listen to me, you worthless shit. You're going to write down all the names and contact details or you'll get this well-seasoned soup until you happily lap it up. And you'll keeping eating it until it destroys your kidneys and you start pissing blood. Is that clear? Enjoy your meal. Don't take it personally. It's not just this. It's everything. I've had it. I need more in my life than just futility. - What will you do? - No idea. I'll go back to psychology, offer counselling. Just the place to meet well-adjusted go- getters. I don't know... I'll go camping somewhere and clear my head. Off you go then and I'll see you in two weeks. - Hello, Mr Rajchrt. - Hello. - Can I have the key, please? - Your wife took it. - Where are we, supposedly? - I'm at a rehearsal. - And you? - Doing an operation. This is the spot. What spot? - The scene of the crime. - Here, was it? This is where, in the summer of '95, I murdered my sister, Milada. What are you saying? I took all the candles in the cottage and used the wax to fashion a doll. She had proper arms, legs, and hair. I used Milada's real hair and then I pierced the doll with all the pins and needles I had in my emergency kit. With every stab I made a wish that Milada would die. I wished for her to fall while abseiling or for her boat to capsize, for her to stop existing. Thank God none of that happened. Nobody died. Yes, they did. - Somebody did die. - Who was that? I did. I died here that day. You scary little thing, you're making me afraid. You're right to be afraid. On this spot you said those beautiful words to me about not hurting people. Remember? And about responsibility and the burden you carry. Do you remember? You wished things had been different but they couldn't be because Milada was pregnant to you and was leaving Lada. You, the knight in shining armour, the real man, you chose to stand by her at the cost of a life with me. I was fourteen. Then you went back to the fire, played your guitar and I heard you and I wasn't even allowed to cry. Not even that. And then I decided that it never happened, that I wouldn't accept it, that it wasn't real, wasn't true. That I'd go on doing things like we'd done until then. And you allowed it to happen. We kept on sleeping together. During the night patrol, in the cottage and outside again. You called it "saying goodbye". You didn't want to hurt me and cause more suffering. Maybe you were waiting for my flame to go out. You didn't know you were making love to someone who was capable of anything. Is there any wine left, little clown? Sorry. Of course there is. You're permeable like a sieve and you're sifting for nuggets of experience. You're afraid of death. I'm not. Maybe you thought you'd help me to stand on my own two feet. You're still doing it, helping people to walk. But sometimes you need to break them before you can fix them. And all those years, every day and every night, I wished you'd leave Milada and Tereza and be with me. For something to happen to them, for them not to be, for you to be with me. You allowed such thoughts to keep coming to me. You never tried to help me. - Bye. - See you. You don't know how to say goodbye, do you? It can be so hard and you don't want anyone to suffer. You don't want to lose anything or anyone. - Where's Danek? - Asleep. You're a listener and that's to your advantage. You're playful but you don't know how to lose. You've led a charmed life. So far. Five years later, it was over. I remember exactly when it happened. It was a warm October day not unlike today and my sister asked me to take Tereza to pre-school. If only she knew, if she suspected what I was thinking while I was taking your child to pre. school. It was unusually calm and quiet as if everyone had hidden from me, as if I'd contracted some infectious disease. Then I realised that I wasn't living my own life and that you weren't my husband. And the only thing left for me was to do penance. I quit medicine, became a blood donor, distributed meals-on-wheels, started making dolls for UNICEF, went to bed with boys nobody else loved. I left the drama group and started acting for sick kids, kids who were helpless, disabled, dying. Now you have two balls. I chose places others wouldn't walk into and I played the clown and made jokes. Enough. Enough? I'll take the bubbles away. I'll catch every one of them. I'm sorry. Every single one. I, a coward by nature, witnessed so much suffering. In the alleviation of suffering I can say the student had outdone her teacher. I thought that with every passing day I was expiating a tiny bit of my sin. Then Dad got sick and I was almost glad to have this new task. To take out for walks and clean the nose of a man for whom I was the source of disappointment and contempt. That's what Dad always says. That this is the only audience for me because they can't get away. But I knew he was right to hold me in contempt. I'm sorry. Do you hear me? Then I realised something terrible. That it was just a pretence, just make believe. That my reason for all the torture was entirely different. I was doing it only to be with you, to be near you. That's what nourished me, kept me alive. Tomas, nobody knows you like I do. I know your every gesture. Your every expression. The meaning of each intonation. I know when you lie, when you're hiding something, when you pretend or when you're being yourself. For fifteen years I've done nothing but look inside you. Milada doesn't know who she's living with. Luckily. You can't hide from me. You wouldn't betray me, would you? I saw her. Who? The young girl. I went to have a look at her. Did you sleep with her? You did? Stop it, please. I don't sleep with kids. When we started sleeping together I was younger than her. I loved you. You don't love me anymore? Is she better? Is she good? What's she like? Tell me. Does she give you blow jobs? Tell me. Better than me? I don't know any other way. You taught me how. If you don't stop I'll go this very minute. Why didn't the police ask me any questions? Why should they have? Because I know a lot about you. I could have told them lots of things about us. If you don't stop, I really will go. - No, you won't. - I will. - No. - I will. Don't go home. I'll call Milada. I'll call her. I'll call her to say that we're here, that we're going to bed together and making love. - Stop it, Lida. - I'll tell her everything. The abortions, everything. - Stop it, Lida. - Fuck me. Or do you only fuck fourteen-year-olds now? Stop it! Lida, stop it. Stop! Stop! Don't scratch! Calm down. Stop this, Lida. It's sick. We'll have to give this up. - Hear me? - You don't love me. I do, but we have to stop. I'm sure you feel it too. Stop it, Lida. You can feel it too. See you tomorrow, at home. Okay? Good. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. XY - drowned female. In a nutshell. The cause of death is drowning with signs of strangulation. The traces of sperm indicate sexual intercourse before she went in the water. We found some tissue under her nails so if it matches the sperm you have the culprit's DNA. She wouldn't have done that herself. She and her husband have been coming for years. - Her husband? - Yes, Dr Kotva. I haven't been there for fifteen years. Are you saying you haven't been at the lake recently? I certainly haven't. Why? Is that your final word? It is. That's enough for me. What's up? Lida is dead. What? Someone killed her. Who? Whoever had sex with her just beforehand. Open your mouth. My dear Tomas, I'm waiting for you. I don't even know why. I don't know what we'll say. What we can express. How hard I should try. Stop. Turn to your right. After many years I'm being paid back for all the sleepless nights. Go in your cell. The furrows are levelled, the harvest is in but to watch you or casually touch your hand or make you laugh with my funny voice is so dear to me, so cosily familiar, that I simply wait. I wait with love you don't reciprocate and which I'm starting to hide. Come and see how clumsily I'm trying to hide something so obvious and which would make you laugh. Darling, twelve years isn't such a long time. I'll wait for you. Yesterday I found a poem by Vladimir Holan. Though you keep getting away from me, you are my constant presence. Just as a waterfall, constantly drained of its water, firmly remains in the same spot. I'm with you, look after yourself. I'm with you, look after yourself. Forever, yours. Forever, yours.
