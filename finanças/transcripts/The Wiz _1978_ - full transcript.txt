There's a whole world out there, and you'll have to begin by letting people see who you really are. Success, fame and fortune, they're all illusions. All there is that is real is the friendship that two can share. That's beautiful. Who said that? l did. (CRYlNG) Oh, Dorothy. l'll think of you all the time. And I will miss you every day. Even if I had to go back to that junk pile, even as Teenie's seat cushion, l wouldn't mind, because I have known real love. Oh, don't rust yourself, now. Oh, Dorothy. lf it hadn't been for you, l'd still be back on that pedestal, afraid to live. Me, too. Thank you. Thank you for being my friends. l'm ready now. Think of home. Home. (SlNGlNG) When I think of home l think of a place Where there's love overflowing l wish I was home l wish I was back there With the things l've been knowing Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning Sprinkling the scene Makes it all clean Maybe there's a chance for me to go back Now that I have some direction lt would sure be nice to be back home Where there's love and affection And just maybe l can convince time to slow up Giving me enough time in my life to grow up Time, be my friend Let me start again Suddenly, my world's gone And changed its face But I still know where l'm going l have had my mind spun around in space And yet l've watched it growing And if you're listening, God Please don't make it hard To know if we should believe the things that we see Tell us, should we run away? Should we try and stay? Or would it be better just to let things be? Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy But it taught me to love So it's real, real to me And l've learned That we must look inside our hearts to find A world full of love like yours, like mine Like home
