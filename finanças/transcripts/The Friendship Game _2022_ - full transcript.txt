Oh, yeah. Do you know who your friends are? What? It's a game, a friendship game. You play it with your friends, your true friends. What's that supposed to mean? True friends? That's what the object will tell you. It tests your friendship. If your friendships don't survive it, neither do you. What is that thing? - A game. - You sit around it. You each place your fingertips on it. You each tell it the truth. Your deepest, innermost desire. If your friendship survives that, then you know you will be friends in all places forever. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Do a flip, Robbie. You okay? Yeah, just the last summer bummers, I guess. Best summer. We'll see. - Oh, shit! - What are you doing?! Wait, wait! Aah! Okay, all we have to do is put our fingertips on it and each share our deepest, innermost desire. Is it bad that my deepest, innermost desires is to not do that? So it's a game. How do you win? We win by staying friends. So we still got to like each other after hearing our innermost desires. Exactly, so tell the truth, or it's not going to work. Come on, guys. We got countable weeks left until we scatter bug all over. Don't you want to know? - Know what? - We play this, and we know. We know we'll be friends forever, no matter what. Friends to the end. From diapers to diapers. Okay. No dickhead answers. Tell the truth. What is it? Your deepest, innermost desire. All right. Who wants to go first? Not fucking me. Dot com. No my turn either. Dot info. You guys are ridiculous. Somebody has to go. Hey, what about you, Cotton? You must have thought about it. No more messing around. Okay. What about you, Cotton. You must have thought about it. Kid days are gone. We're already getting sucked into these things that we're supposed to do or be... High school, college, job, family. One day, we wake up, and we're fucking parents. I just hope that we can break out of that reality. I just hope we can break out of that reality. Oh, I got a fucking dent. You're so fucked. I got to go. Okay. Courtney? - Where are Robbie and Z? - Huh? - Do you have a lighter? - Where are they? I don't know. Whoa! What the fuck, Cotton? You're not listening. Something's happening, okay? They can't be alone together. We... we have to find them. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking abut? Nothing's happening. You know what? I got something for you. - It's the pills you wanted. - No. Just smoke a joint. Take your perks. Dance your ass off with me. Enjoy it. It's a fucking party. - Here, take 'em. - No. - Take 'em, take 'em. - No, no. Whoa, why the fuck?! Cotton! I thought we were friends. No, I-I have to find them. What? Can you... Can you get a lighter? We know we'll be friends forever, no matter what. No matter what. We win by staying friends... Friends. Cotton. Have your friendships survived? Ben called me. Ben from the day camp. He said you haven't been there all week. Do you not like to go? What do you do all day then? Just ride your bike round? Did you make some friends? I just want to know that I'm not going to get another call about you getting in trouble. Tell the truth. What is it? Your deepest, innermost desire? What about you, Z? He dug her guts all out looking for the human spark. - Her guts? - Into her fucking uterus, the human spark. You watched this with Cotton, didn't you? Cotton?! Where the fuck is she? If she's not here in the next 10 minutes, I'm drinking her share. I think you're drinking her share right now. Vodka. - Court! - Empty. No! No!! Have some now. Oh, God, a fucking train wreck. This is a train wreck. So fucking hot. You think there's an end to it? And end to what? Space, the universe. It's summer, Robbie. I don't want to think about that shit. Here, give me your fingers. Okay. Hold it. It's Rob, by the way. What? Yeah. Robbie's the kid's name. And I am a man, - a grown up. - Oh, God. Since when? - Yeah. There we go. - All right. All right. Ah. No, I mean it. You believe that shit? About it all being infinite? Sure, Bob. Just consider it, Z. Right, an infinite universe means an infinite number of realities. Infinite you's. Infinite me's, everyone. Kind of sounds like a way to get what you want. Yeah. Well, what do you want, Zooza? I want this summer to last forever. Hm. A month from now, you'll be in Colorado, and Cotton will be at State. Mm-hmm. But Court will still be here. Well, it's looking that way. And Cotton is like an hour away. You guys are going to hang out like every weekend. And I'll join on breaks. We'll be fine, Z. I promise. Okay. Look, in this version of the universe right now, we're together. In all that infinite space or time or whatever the fuck, we're all together. Let's just be glad we got so lucky. All of us. Maybe this is the one, Z. One what? Version of reality where we stay friends? Forever. Last time we kissed, we said we'd never do it again. There's still some universes where we haven't. ♪ Bring back, bring back, bring back ♪ ♪ Bring back, bring back, ♪ ♪ All I ever wanted was to feel your touch ♪ ♪ Bring back the thunder that gave us love ♪ ♪ Bring back the thunder ♪ ♪ All I ever wanted was to feel your touch ♪ Robbie. - Did the fuckin' condom break? - What? - Robbie, get the fuck off of me. - What?! Fuck. Have your friendships survived? Susan, honey? What is it, Mom? I got to go. This is Detective Modari. She'd like to ask you a few questions. About your friend Cotton. I apologize for showing up like this. We've interviewed all Cotton's classmates. - Including me. - Well, that's why I'm here today, to follow up on a few details. Everyone said they saw Cotton at the trash house party. Several people said they saw her leave. She was upset or scared. That was the last anyone saw of her. You were at that party, right? Yeah. Everyone was. But you didn't see her? - No. - You're at the same party, best friends, and you never crossed each other? I was wasted. What? I hope you didn't drive. I didn't. You had an arrest for drug possession last year. How come you didn't mention that before? Don't police have a computer? What does that have to do with her friend? Are you taking any drugs now? Right this moment? Some, um, pain meds a few years ago, when my dad left. Not for long. It wasn't her fault. Did anything else happened between the two of you before the party? Something that would have tested your friendship? Maybe put you two at odds. Anything that would have made her leave. Some detective came by asking about her. You don't know where she is. Right? - I would have told you. - Yeah. We should probably spread these out. If you want people to see them. Well, it's easier for people to see them like this. I don't know, Z. Sometimes I just... I feel like... I just feel that she's not just like missing from this town, but, like... from this world. She wanted to leave for years. You know that. So she did. Well, she wouldn't just leave without telling us. She was our friend. Yeah, well, people leave. They don't come back. She's not some lost puppy. Sorry. I don't know. I... I just... I can't believe she did it. I can't believe that this is my fucking life right now. - What? - Okay, guys, here comes the bumper fun. Push both levers forward to go forward. Back to go back. Push one forward, one back to spin. And, uh... And if another car... Susan. Hello? Tell the truth. What is it? Your deepest, innermost desire. What about you, Z? Who's there? We win by staying friends. Have your friendships survived? Z, I've been texting and calling all week. Can we talk? Z, Come on. We need to talk. We really don't. Yes, we do. For Cotton. All right? We need to figure what happened. Yeah, she left, Robbie. She went somewhere, and so will you. We're still friends. We can fix this. Are we? Really? No. Hey, look, Z, look. I'm so sorry, Sue, baby. What? Just when we were getting things back together for you. Now this. Cotton's probably riding on the back of some dude's motorcycle right now or something. Yeah, let's hope so. As opposed to what? That she got murdered? Jesus, Susan. Well, you're the one thinking it. - She's your best friend. - Yeah, she was. We were supposed to get out of this shit hole together. Language. I guess I'm just getting used to it. People leave. That's what life is. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you. He was an addict. It's a disease. Another person who you love is suddenly not here. It's okay to feel something. I know you love Cotton. You have all your friends, Zooza. That's why they love you back. Mm. Yeah. I can really feel Cotton's love right now. Cotton didn't run away from you, and neither did your father. You know what? Dad left because of someone, Mom. Maybe it was because of me. Or maybe it was because of you. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe it was just everything. No dickhead answers. Tell the truth. What is it? Your deepest, innermost desires. Center Court, you're up. I'm still on the wait list at U.O. My deepest desire is that I get the letter that I'm in. Oh, some pot would really kick this in to Gunga Din. Do you have any? No. But I bet I could get some. What's Gunga Din? I don't know. Some, like, weed guy. Full Court press. Oh, got a fucking dent. You're so fucked. I got to go. Okay. Courtney? - Cotton! - Where are Robbie and Z? Do you have a lighter? Mm. You know what? I got something for you. It's the pills you wanted. Oh, why the fuck?! Cotton! I thought we were friends. What do... Why would you do that? I can't believe she did it. I can't believe that this is my fucking life right now. What? Look, Z, I didn't... think I was going to get in. None of us did. Well, this is what I said to that thing. She got that shit at a yard sale. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. But, like, I didn't really finish high school off with a bang. So I don't know, maybe this is all part of it. Cotton said a lot of crazy shit, Court. You're just the only one dumb enough to believe it. So then you meant what you said then? About your deepest desire? Every fucking word. Don't you want to know? We play this, and we know. Huh? I'm filming, motherfucker. Yeah. Court. Court, listen. Court. Don't you remember? Cotton? Have your friendships survived? How could you? What the fuck? No dickhead answers. Tell the truth. What is it? Your deepest, innermost desire? Robbie, what about you? I don't know if I should say this one. You can only have one. It's your innermost desire. You'll make fun of me. - No, we won't. - Yeah, we will. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Since you guys are my best friends, I'm going to be honest. What? Robbie. Oh. Did the fucking condom break? What? Get the fuck off of me. Hey, Z, what... Hey, Z! We're still friends, right? We can fix this. Are we. Really? No. Hey, look. Z, our desires, all right? They're coming true, all of them! Z! Even yours! Maybe this is the one, Z. Version of reality where we stay friends... we stay friends. Tell the truth. What is it? Robbie, what about you? Cotton? Robbie. What the fuck? Have your friendships survived? The game? You're all going to fail. The game. Kyle. Do you want to play a game with me? This. You've seen some things you shouldn't have... you shouldn't have. - Big date tonight? - Yeah, something like that. Thank you so much, Susan. I know things didn't exactly go great the last time you sat. Yeah, I have the police on quick dial now. Is quick dial an app, or is that just something you made up? Uh, it's an app, I think. I don't know. I don't have it. Well, he's really into computers these days. I know he's a little bit past baby sitting, but I... I just need somebody to watch him. For pizza. There's an extra $20 in it for you if you can get him to clean his room up. Thank you again, Susan. You really saved my ass tonight. Well, guy sees you tonight in that dress, it's his ass that's gonna need saving. Sure as hell's not alone. I'm gonna see if he stole another car. Hey! Hey. What the hell? Look, I brought it, Z. It? The thing Cotton had. Friendship game. So how'd you get it? You stole it. Well, I had to. Look, our deepest desires, the things we told it, everything, they're happening. It's true, Z. I mean, I had a 2.6 last semester. How the hell did that put me through? Mine too. For the good or bad of it. Okay. So, what now? I don't get it. What, we get as many desires as we can think of? Well, she said we had to tell it the truth, remember? Our deepest, innermost desire. So if it changes, we can play again, right? I don't think that makes any sense. Well if it doesn't work, we tried. Look, do you guys want to know or not? Okay, our fingers. I'll go first. I want to know what happened to Cotton. I want to know what happened to Cotton. I want to know what happened to Cotton. Just like life, you only get to play once. Hey. You hear it? It's vibrating. Did it do that before? Didn't do anything before, did it? Oh, geez. That thing fuckin' bit me. Shit. No. I can't do this, you guys. I told you that we shouldn't be playing with that thing. You think that's a good idea? Why the fuck did we do that? To find out what happened to her. Alright, so Cotton said it was a test. And you've seen how Zooza's been acting lately. Yeah, she doesn't give a shit. Her desire, Court, what she said when we first play the game. Hey. I do give a shit. It's you guys who are leaving. I'm the only one who didn't give up on this friendship. Fuck this. I'm over it. This game, you guys, I'm going home. Hey, Court, just wait. If your friendships don't survive the game, then neither to you. That's what Cotton said. That was the rule, right? And that thing showed us what it's like if our desires become real and look at us. Are we really going to give up on Cotton? How are you supposed to stay friends if we don't even know where she is? What the hell is this? Connecting? All we have to do is put our fingertips on it and share our deepest, innermost desires. Is it bad that my deepest, innermost desire is not to do that? - This is Cotton's web cam. - So, we still got to like each other after hearing our deepest desire? - Exactly. - I don't like this. Shut the fuck up, Court. - Your turn. - I'm still on the wait list at U.O. My deepest desire is that I get the letter that I'm in. Robbie, what about you? I don't know if I should say this one. You can only have one. - It's your innermost desire. - You'll make fun of me. - No, we will never. - Yeah, we will. Yeah. Okay. My deepest desire... ...is that I really want to be good at sex. Jesus, Robbie going full dude. Fuck. Yes, okay? There, I said it. Are you happy? I don't know if happy is how I'd describe it. What about you, Z? Your deepest, innermost desire. Deepest desire? You guys leaving is going to break my heart. I just hope that when you do, I don't give a shit anymore. What the fuck is this? Connecting? From where? Uh, it's not a text. Maybe an air drop? From the game? It has fucking wi-fi? The kid. The... we asked the game what happened to Cotton. Maybe it's trying to show us where to find her. The fuckin' computer weirdo? He was recording us? Maybe. I don't know. He's... He's been suspended for that kind of shit before. Okay, if he was recording Cotton's room... What else has he seen up there? If I can bring him downstairs and distract him, can you go up there and look on his computer? Kyle? Can I come in? My old man was really into Italian horror. He's dead now. Well, dead drunk somewhere, probably. My dad's dead, too. Really dead. Yeah. I know. People know. Every family is massively fucked up. Oh, "Bag of Guts." You know, you're not old enough to know what a VHS tape is, right? Neither am I. Hey. Do you want to watch this tonight? Uh, unh-unh. No. I can't do this. This... watching this is making me physically ill. I'm going to raid the liquor cabinet in protest. Hey. Hey. Coward. Waste of a beautiful stomach. Whoa. Holy shit. She was one of my favorites, too. Jesus, kid! You know this is fucked up, right? Like pervert juvie hall fucked up. Do you know who this was? This guy? Do you have any other videos of her with him? Okay, Kurt, let's hear it. It's very strange. What else? Hey. It's like I... You see that? It's become a child. There. Just a child. There's something so private about her. Yeah, she's always been like that. From when we were kids. Wait. That's... But I... We never... Did we? It all disappears, vanishes. Okay, nothing, George. Are you looking at... Crystals maybe, or magnets. I can't figure out how it does it. What is it doing? At other times, it's... Hey, are you all right? Hey, what happened? Robbie? You okay? I don't know. What did you find up there? On the computer? Z, do you remember the party? I never saw Cotton before she disappeared. But... I didn't tell you. It was us, Z. What do you mean? What was us? It was because of us. Because of us that she ran away. It was Cotton that walked out on us. What? You guys were like sleeping together? Do you ever feel like it's not you? Who's done the things you've done? Not you who lived them. You're scaring me, Robbie. Don't fucking call me Robbie! How could you? Court? Hey. Hey. You're okay. You're okay. Hey. Hey. I saw something. In the mirror. What? Don't ask me. Fuckin'... get the fuck out. You're okay, baby-bot. Zooza. Remember when I was the only one that used to call you that? Yeah. For like two years. And Cotton caught on pretty quick. Robbie, though... You slept with him, didn't you? Kind of started at the end at the party. It just... it felt like you guys were ignoring me. But then later I was talking to him and... he starts saying all this shit about like infinite universes and just how like lucky we are to have each other. And it was like... it was him, but less familiar. Maybe this is the one universe where we stay friends forever. He used the same line on you? Guess we're both fucking idiots. Yeah! God, I want to hate him so fuckin' bad right now. Hey, kid. What are you doing out here? You okay? Cotton? Oh, my God! Did you do this?! If this is a test, we're failing it. No, no. Court! Zooza! Zooza! Court! I still love you, though. Love you, too, Z. I still love you, though. Love you, too, Z. Rob? I need a drink. Where do you think Robbie went? Robbie? Court... Tell the truth, or it's not going to work. We play this, and we know. We know we'll be friends forever, no matter what. What about you, Z? I want to know what happened to Cotton. I want to know what happened to Cotton. I fucking threw up. I'm leaving. You just got here. - We drank you vodka... - I'm leaving. And not just the party, Zooza. My car is packed. I'm leaving now. Okay. - I'll go with you. - No. You're not invited. We always talked about going, all of us. I saw you with him, Susan. Susan? Hello? Court? Court, listen. This already happened. Cotton, where are you? Don't you remember? Thanks for getting the pills from me. I took them all, Court. I didn't... I... I... I didn't. Thank you, Rob. My baby Robbie boy. I liked you. It tested all of us. And we failed. I want to go, and I don't want you to come. No. - Why? - Because you're my friend! I don't like you. No one does. There's a reason your fucking dad left. No, no, no, no. I'm really sorry. Oh, God! No, Cotton! You'll always be my best friend, Court. My dad left because of him. His own shit. You want to leave me alone, too, now, Cotton, that's on you. You always do this. If it's not someone else, your dad, your mom, the world, me. It's on you, Z. You did this. We never should have played that game, Robbie. Every version of this ends with me dead. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Maybe this is the one. Version of reality where we stay friends. You asked us what happened to her. But that didn't happen. Cotton's my friend. Is she? That wasn't my cotton. We tested you, and you failed. You failed. Remember your deepest desire, Susan. Do you care about it more than you do about your friends? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Robbie. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Robbie, are you okay? Who's blood is this? None of your friends survive the game. Courtney? Ah! We're coming, Zooza. No, no, no! No! No! Robbie, stop! You can't do this! Robbie, we're best friends. We're best friends... best friends... What about you, Z? Cotton? Tell the truth. You did this. Your deepest, innermost desire. Have your friendships survived? I thought you left me. Like my dad did. I hated him for that. I don't hate you, Cotton. I never will. No matter what. You let me down. I know. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Do you know who your friends are? What? It's a game. A friendship game. It tests your friendship. If your friendships don't survive it, neither do you. What is that thing? A game. It tests your friendships. You play it with your friends, your true friends. Does this look like it needs testing? Come on, true friend. There's a flee market at the church. - I want a go-Gurt. - A go-Gurt. - Shotgun. - No, no, no! Oh! Ah! Ah! What is it? Z, what's your deepest desire? What? Something that you want. Or want to change about yourself. A dream that you wish were true. Your deepest, innermost desire. I don't know. My wish already came true. I just want to be with my friends. - Oh! - Gorgonzola.
