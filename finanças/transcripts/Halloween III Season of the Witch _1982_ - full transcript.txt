One of the nurses told me I could find you here. I saw you at the funeral. Thank you. I'm sorry about your father. Did my father say anything to you the night he died? Yeah. He, uh... Yeah. He said, "Tell Ellie I love her." Well... you're a bad liar, but... - thank you anyway. - Wait a second. I saw something that night. I don't know. Your father came into the hospital and he-- I thought he was crazy, out of his mind. He's hangin' on to a Halloween mask. He wouldn't let it go. And what he said was... "They're gonna kill us all." And in a little while, he was dead. And I don't know what the hell is goin' on. - [doorbell ringing] - [door creaking] [Ellie] Papa really loved this place, but business was getting bad. I suppose you shopped at the new mall like everybody else, huh? The kids were keeping him going. They'd come in after school. He'd let 'em play with the stuff right in the aisles like used to when I was little. The question is, why would anybody wanna kill Papa? He was a wonderful man. He-- I've been doing some detective work. My father kept excellent records. "October 18: Merchants council meeting.” He was there. I checked. "October 19: Football game." He was there too. "October 20: Pick up more masks." [Dan] Yeah. That's the kind your father had in his hand. "October 21: Dinner with Minnie."” Minnie Blankenship. He never showed up. He never called. You've been busy. I think my father ran into trouble somewhere between here and Santa Mira. Santa Mira? Where they make those. - Oh. - Little place. Not too far away. Maybe they know something.

Yeah, that's it. Then we go about 10 miles and turn right on 33. [Ellie] What I wanna know is why they put their factory out here in the middle of nowhere. [Dan] Listen... Santa Mira founded in 1887, farming community. Grew up around a large dairy. After World War II, a wealthy Irishman, Conal Cochran converted it into a toy factory, Silver Shamrock Novelties. Now given over to the manufacture and sale of Halloween masks. Largest in the world. Proud community. Predominantly Irish. [Ellie] Irish Halloween masks? [Dan] In California, you never know. [music continues] I feel like a goldfish. Company town. [music continues] [camera whirring] [Ellie] I'm not ready for this. We need a plan. [Dan] Okay. How about this? We go back to that gas station, see if they know anything. We could, uh... pose as a couple of buyers, maybe rent a couple of rooms in that motel. That way at least we'd have some place to talk without the whole town watching us. Good point. [bell clanging] - [birds chirping] - [dog barking] - Ah. Good evening to you. - Say, partner, uh, Do you happen to know is there a vacancy here in this motel? My wife and I need a place to stay. You've come to the right place.

[woman] Watch your driving, honey. You could've killed that man. I didn't hurt him! Hey, sorry about that. Glad it didn't hit ya. And great big thank you for pickin' it up. You all right? - No problem. - Hey, Buddy Kupfer, San Diego. This is my wife, Betty. Pleased to meet you. [chuckles] And right there's Little Buddy. - Is it busted? - No. Don't you dare go in the street! Do you hear me?! I gotta go. [man] I'll be checkin' you in now, sir. I filled out the register. I left 40 dollars under the blotter. - That about cover it? - Oh, heavens, yes. Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant stay. [car approaching] Mr. Kupfer, I presume? Your rooms are waiting. Damn factory! Got their orders all screwed up. Now I have to stay in this dump again! [Buddy] Oh, that's great. Hey honey, it's a freebie! [door opens] This place is a zoo. I saw Cochran. His car, anyway. And your old man stayed here on the 20th. I was right! We'll go directly to the factory. Whoa. Hold on. Slow down, slow down. It's getting late. I could use a drink. Let's take our time. It's okay with you? To stay, I mean? Yeah, I think these, uh, clothes could probably hold out for at least one more day. Maybe I ought to get another room. That would look sort of suspicious, wouldn't it? What I mean is, if you'd... feel more comfortable... I could sleep in the car. It'd be better than this floor, anyway. Where do you wanna sleep, Dr. Challis? That's a dumb question, Miss Grimbridge. [distant bells ringing] [bells continue] [woman over PA] It's six o'clock. It's six o'clock. Curfew. Curfew.

Hey, just a second. You, uh... You happen to know anything about this Cochran? Cochran. [scoffs] Do I know anything? He made Santa Mira what it is today. Dried up, little pile of nothing. Let me tell you something, mister. He brought in every damn one of them factory people from the outside. You think he'd hire me? A local boy? - No way. Turned me down flat. - [lighter igniting] You haven't got a dollar you can spare, do you? Mm-hmm. Thank you. All I can tell you, mister, is watch out. You seen the TV cameras yet?

Hall of Fame time. - What's famous? - You really don't know? Conal Cochran, the all-time genius of the practical joke. He invented sticky toilet paper. - Oh. - Oh, you must know. The dead dwarf gag, the soft chain saw. All his. No, gee, I didn't know that. And before that, he used to make toys. Remember that? When I had one of those when I was a kid, used to sit and watch it for hours. The man has always paid attention to detail. - [Cochran] Are we all together? - [Betty] Yeah. Oh, I want a mask. Can I have a mask? Just what I had in mind for you, Little Buddy. I want that one. Oh, no, no, no, no. Look over here. Those masks haven't been through final processing. This one has. - [chuckles] - [Little Buddy] Whoa! There you are. [laughs] That's wonderful. - What final process? - Don't ask me. [Cochran laughing] Hey, Mr. Cochran, just what is the final process? I assure you it's just a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Quality inspection, the seal of approval. You know, the usual. And of course, there's a couple of trade secrets. [laughs] I'd sure love to take a look. Oh, sorry. Not even a peek for your best salesman? Oh, just one little look. Well you see, Part of the inspection process involves volatile chemicals, very dangerous. I wouldn't want to put anybody in any danger. Oh, sure, I understand. Now listen, I hope you and your family will be able to have breakfast with me tomorrow morning. I'd like your opinion on some of our sales material. - [Buddy] My opinion? - [Cochran] Oh, sure. Do you know he's one of the richest men in the country? And he got that way selling cheap gags and Halloween masks. Oh, God, there's hope for us yet. [Cochran] It's very valuable to me, you know. Your opinion has always meant a great deal to us - over the last few years. - Oh, thank you, sir. - Where's Little Buddy? - Oh, there he is, running down there. [Cochran and Buddy laughing] Into everything always. Well, we like to know everything there is to know. - Like father, like son. - Oh, yeah. [ominous music] Excuse me. Darling?

[Betty on monitor] I don't like this place. It gives me the creeps. [Little Buddy on monitor] I have to go to the bathroom. - Mommy! - Relax a minute, will you? Mr. Cochran'll be here. Then everything will be fine. He just wants my opinion about some television commercials or something. You know, I still can't figure out why they won't take my orders for next year.

I've got something down here - I'd like for you to look at. - [Roger] What? - [ominous music] - I know I could be wrong, but I don't think it's a car part at all. Maybe you've seen something like it.

Operator, can you get me the sheriff-- [dramatic music] [gasps] [grunting] [whirring] [panting] [squelching] [smooth music playing on radio] [squelching] [insects chirping] Enjoy the "Horrorathon," Doctor. And don't forget to watch the big giveaway afterwards. Why, Cochran? Why? Do I need a reason? Mr. Kupfer was right, you know. I do love a good joke. And this is the best ever. A joke on the children. But there's a better reason. You don't really know much about Halloween. You thought no further than the strange custom of having your children wear masks and go out begging for candy. [ominous music] It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands and we'd be waiting in our houses of wattles and clay. The barriers would be down, you see, between the real and the unreal. And the dead might be looking in to sit by our fires of turf. Halloween. The festival of Samhain. The last great one took place 3,000 years ago and the hills ran red... with the blood of animals and children. Sacrifices. They were part of our world, our craft. Witchcraft. [Cochran] To us, it was a way of controlling our environment. It's not so different now. It's time again. In the end, we don't decide these things, you know. The planets do. They're in alignment. And it's time again. The world's going to change tonight, Doctor. I'm glad you'll be able to watch it. [eerie music on TV] And, happy Halloween.

[exhales] [Cochran] Tonight's just for fun. A way of saying "thank you" to all our good customers. Mr. Cochran. [man over phone] I have good news for you. Hold on just a moment. [music continues] It's always a pleasure doing business with you. It is indeed. [rustling] Oh! [chuckles] Oh. 43 share. You think so? [music intensifies] Good. And I hope the little ones will be watching. Don't forget to tell them to watch the big giveaway at nine. [panting] Thank you for calling. Goodbye. Sir? Malfunction. Camera two.

And they killed Buddy Kupfer and his whole family. - They killed him. - [Linda] It's not enough-- [man] We've lost him. No, we haven't. You'll see. [buttons clicking] No, no, no, I'm not drunk. Linda, listen. You have to get rid of the masks. - Just-- - [Linda] You want me to what? You're just jealous because - they love me more... - Linda, Linda, listen. [Linda] Go to hell!
