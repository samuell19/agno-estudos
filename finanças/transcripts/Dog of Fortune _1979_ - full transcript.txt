A Daiei Motion Picture Company Film AUTUMN, 1978, HOKKAIDO Here it goes. Kitamori, are you alright? Hold on! Stop! We have to pick up Goro. Goro! Goro! Goro! Catch up! Kitamori, forgive me. It's my fault. I shouldn't have dragged you out of Tokyo to go hunting. Hold on, Kitamori! Hold on, Kitamori! We're almost there. *OPERATION IN PROGRESS* Is he... ...dead? Yes. I don't believe you! Kitamori! Kitamori! THE GOLDEN DOG What? Goro hasn't come back? No. We've looked everywhere around the farm. Keep looking. Call the police, the fire brigade, the rescue service - everyone. But find Goro! I can't do it anymore. My feet are killing me. I want to finally sleep in a soft bed. It's dangerous in Yokohama. Besides, we have no money. How many times do I have to tell you? I want to go back to Tokyo. Don't you? And you don't care you might get killed? - I do. - Then stop whining. Enough! If I get killed, let it be. But I want to go back to Tokyo. I'm sick of this tramp life. I want to have normal food and sake. Hey! - Don't. - Let go of me! - Stop it. Are you out of your mind? - I'm going back. Hey! Stop! Give us a lift, please. Nagayama! Let's go! They've agreed to give us a lift. Do you hear me? They'll give us a lift. You don't want to go? Very well. Then I'll go alone. Come on! Get in the car! Thank you very much. You really helped us out. - You must be from Tokyo. - That's right. What are you doing? Aren't we supposed to go through Tomakomai? - Do you see him? - No. He has nowhere to run. Let's hide the body first. We can look for him later. KUSHIRO POLICE STATION Sir, you left this! - Here are the pictures. - Can't you see I'm eating? We haven't identified the body yet. But forensics say he was killed with some unusual kind of gun. Show him. Here it is. We don't have the database here to determine the kind of gun. We'll have to send it to Tokyo. Do whatever you think is right. Excuse me? Yasutaka, don't you care? You were assigned to this case. It's just Yakuza killing their own. We won't get another chance like this. I'm freezing. Excuse me. Hey, what's wrong with you? What happened? Goro. Meguro, Tokyo. So you're from Tokyo. How did you get here? He has pneumonia. - Is he going to be alright? - I'll give him an injection. He'll be fine in three days. This is a rare kind of dog you picked up. He must have got lost, so he's trying to get home now. To Tokyo? It's impossible! Why not? Dogs can find a way back home from anywhere. If you want to know the owner's exact address, open the capsule. Goro. Get well soon and go back to Tokyo. I wish I could go with you. Unfortunately... ...I can't do that. NAGAYAMA'S HOUSE So, where is your husband? I don't know. You're lying. He must have called at least once. He hasn't. Where exactly on Hokkaido is he? Please, my child is sleeping. Leave me alone. Please. No! Get undressed. I'll kill you. Don't kill me. So are you getting undressed or not? Yes or no? Yes. Even while I was observing the house, I knew that you'd be mine. Go on. You'll do whatever I say. Yes. I see. Thank you. The victim has been identified. It's a journalist named Tadao Ohashi, aged 42. Our people in Tokyo are gathering information about him. Now about the weapon. It was a CZ 75. Made in Czech Republic? Yes. - Why? - It's a powerful gun. A CZ then... Does it ring a bell? The gears seem to finally be in motion. The victim had matches with your club's logo in his pocket. Looks like the man who was here about ten days ago. Nagayama-san was having a drink, and this man joined him. Nagayama-san? Head of Arms Department in the Ministry of Industry and Trade. What have you found out? We know that... ...on October 17th, Tadao Ohashi was drinking in the Ginza Club... ...together with the Head of Arms Department... ...in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Yukichi Nagayama... ...aged 36. Two days after, Nagayama disappeared. Well, Yasutaka, are you interested in the case now? Goro! Goro... ...let's leave this place together. Could you give us a minute? Of course. Have a nice time. Thank you. I've been watching you for a long time. You live a lavish life. You bought a house and a car. You spend every night in this expensive club. What are you getting at? Not long ago, you gave permission to export a special kind of ships... to one of the countries in Southeast Asia. Ordinary civil ships. Except for cannons. They were removed to avoid complications. But if you put them back in place, you get great military ships. That's a great business. Even better than fighter jets. It's nothing but assumptions. Not exactly. I know for a fact that someone from the government... received 2.5 billion yen for this. Here's a copy of their correspondence with private firms. 30 million yen and it's yours. 30 million? HEAD OF ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT You signed the permission to export. Don't drag me into this. I signed it, but on your orders. If Ohashi publishes this... ...the Prosecutor's Office won't be interested in me alone. It's unpleasant when some punk tries to blackmail you. But if the problem can be solved with money, it's safer to pay. I agree. But you'll have to tighten your belt too. SAUNA I have a feeling that I'm being followed. Have you hired a hitman? I received phone calls with threats myself. You too? We know too much. And someone doesn't like it. Alright, I'll give you the copies for 20. Even for 10 million. - Talk to your boss again. - It's not only about money anymore. You've stirred up a hornet's nest. What are you talking about? My boss wants to get rid of me. So don't count on getting your money. What do you mean? I can sell them to a newspaper and earn good money. Stop right there. They won't let you do that. Leave me alone. The door is locked. What's going on? Hey! Unlock the door! Unlock the door! We're going to die in here! What's going on? We almost chocked in there! I don't understand. Are you deaf? We screamed for you. Someone must have played a joke on you. The door was blocked with this. You were right. They're trying to kill me. Not just you, but me as well. They won't stop until we're dead. What are we going to do? We have to run. But where? As far from here as possible. Wait for me. Leave me alone! You started this! Goro, let's go. Goro, are you alright? Good dog. Hello? Nagayama's house. Hello? Hello? - Who is it? - They aren't saying anything. Hello? Hello? Is it you? It's you, isn't it? Hello? Where are you? Say something. Are you okay? Tell me. Are you alright? Hello? I knew you'd come. Get undressed. Now! Seems like your body can't forget me. Wait. - Close the curtains, please. - What for? But... Get on your knees. You like being humiliated, don't you? - I can't hear you. - Yes. I don't need you tomorrow. A woman, whose husband has disappeared, killed her daughter and then committed suicide. The incident occurred in the Tamagawa district, Chofu, Tokyo prefecture. The deceased are Junko Nagayama aged 29 and her daughter Tomoko aged 5. Their bodies were found today at 7 AM. Goro! It's dangerous! Let it go! Goro! Goro! Eat, Goro. To eat is to live. And to fight is to live. Junko, Tomoko... ...I'm coming back to you. I'm coming back to Tokyo. What? You have a copy of the contract? Yes. And I'm coming back to Tokyo. I'll confess and get it published. It's going to be the best revenge for the deaths of my family. And one more thing. You can kill me too, but know this... the copy will still be delivered. Goro. I entrust you with something more valuable than my own life. Listen, Goro... ...whatever happens to me... ...you have to take this to Tokyo. Do you hear me? What is it, Goro? Let me go! No! Faster! Shut up and don't move! Hey you! Stop! Get lost! Get the fuck out of here! Goro! Attack! It hurts! Let go of me! Let's get out of here! I was travelling around Hokkaido. And I was just going to go back to Tokyo. That's when it happened... You shouldn't be so trustful. It can get you in trouble. Who else do we trust if we don't trust people? They were so nice. They offered to help me change the wheel. I thought they were just nice people. It was so naive of me. I'll never forgive them. And I won't keep quiet either. That's why I'm asking you to go to the police with me. To the police? Yes, I want you to act as a witness. I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. Besides, you don't really need me. What do you mean? How else am I going to prove I'm telling the truth? I want to take them to court. A TRAMP AND HIS DOG SAVE WOMAN FROM RAPISTS HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN NEWSPAPER What are we doing here anyway? They wouldn't deal with me alone. Good afternoon! Still not ready? We need ten more minutes to develop the photos. - Thank you for your help. - Not at all. By the way, a woman expressed interest in that dog. What woman? It's our Goro, I'm sure. You may be wrong. The picture isn't clear. I feel it. - You're talking like a policeman. - Yasutaka-san! But what if you're wrong? Let me ask you, Mrs Kitamori, where do you live? In Tokyo. When I read the article, I flew here immediately. You flew this far because of a dog? Goro is very dear to me. My late husband loved him very much. I've blown it up. It's still fuzzy, but it's better. It's Goro. It's him. Look, I attached this capsule to his collar myself. What capsule? I put our home address there. Just in case, because my husband often went hunting to Shibetsu. To Shibetsu, you say? This is where Goro got lost. Yasutaka-san, the journalist's body was found nearby. No way! Look, Mount Shibetsu is in the north of the island. And the woman was attacked in the south, on the coast. I doubt it's the same dog. I also have a feeling. Mrs Kitamori, will you come with us to the port? They found a dog on the ferry. When does it arrive in Aomori? At 8 PM. I see. Take me with you. Goro, run! Don't worry, Goro. I'll be alright. AOMORI AIRPORT Dear citizens of Aomori! Greetings from Yoichi Tozawa, candidate for parliament from our island. He's the right person to... Confess. In the Ichimangoku port, you put two gangsters on a ship. The ship was called Ikumaru. It was going to Otaru. Halfway, they got on a cruise liner and escaped. And don't tell us you don't know anything. Speak! You'll tell me everything. What's gotten into you? Who approached you? Speak! Who told you to get them on board? Speak, bastard! Are you going to talk or not? Goto. - Goto? - Yes. The one with a mark on his face? That's the one. - Do you know him? - I do. - It's Yoichi Tozawa's man. - Yoichi Tozawa? The candidate for parliament? Yoichi Tozawa is here to secure a happy future for us. Vote for Yoichi Tozawa! The man who will make our island and our country prosper! Citizens of Hokkaido, vote for Yoichi Tozawa! TOZAWA HEADQUARTERS Great. Thank you so much. Mr Shunsuke Goto! Police. Come with us. What is it about? You helped two gangsters escape. You want to interrupt our election campaign? But this is what it looks like. You want to arrest me right before elections without any evidence. We have a witness. I arrest you. It's unacceptable! Hold on. I'm Tozawa. Do you have an arrest warrant? Not yet. Then in what grounds are you acting on? We're in the middle of the election campaign. You're well-aware that interrupting it is a serious violation of the law. And yet I'm going to take him to the police station. You won't dare. You know what the consequences may be. So? Don't just stand there. Apologize to me and to Shunsuke Goto. And then get out. Now... ...call the governor and notify the Tokyo Police Department. Yes. Don't hide behind the elections. Are you going to fight? - No, I'm just... - My patience has run out! I'm going to sue you for interrupting my campaign! - Hold him! - Yasutaka-san, don't! Let's go. I think it was reckless of you to talk to him like that. Why did you get so worked up anyway? You really think it was uncalled for? Maybe there are some serious reasons? It happened five years ago. A hostess was found dead in her room. She was the lover of the President of State Land Development Corporation. She was given to him by a very well-known real estate company. In return, he gave them a plan for constructing the northeast high-speed railway system. They immediately bought the land where the Shinkansen was going to be. The girl's house was in that area. She also kept a diary. And when he wanted to dump her, she demanded a lot of money... ...threatening to make her diary public. Behind the President, was one of then-ministers. He made a fortune by buying that land. Naturally, with state funds. That minister's name was Yoichi Tozawa. The girl was killed by a hitman. The murder weapon was a CZ. I was in charge of the investigation, but Tozawa didn't let me finish it. It's just your assumption. It's much simpler. An ordinary love triangle, where the dumped one decided to take revenge. Do you know a lot of people who use a CZ? I'll get to the bottom of this. It's not important. The case is closed. It's an order from above. From above? From who exactly? This time, I'll bring him to justice. And I'll find Nagayama and protect him from those who are trying to kill him. HOTEL SUNROUTE AOMORI - Mr Yasutaka? - Yes. This is for you from Mrs Kitamori. I've rented a car to go to Mount Hakkoda. I want to look for Goro there. I also think that, trying to escape, Nagayama found a remote place for himself. - Get us a police car. - Yes. Goro! Goro! Goro! Hello. Excuse us. Yes? She's here. - Now undress her. - What for? We'll scatter her clothes all over the place. The dog will come to us, and Nagayama too. Get on your knees. If you don't, I'll kill you. Get her down. Now crawl. You'll crawl until the ground starts to smell of you. Faster! The police is here! Stop here. Don't make a sound, or I'll kill you. Help! There are too many of them. Shut up and get the car. Hey! Stop! Are you trying to get yourself killed? Police! It's not fair! You're dressed as a civilian! - I need your help. - How's that? Chase that police car. - What? - A criminal is driving it. - Speed up! - This is goin' to be fun. Usually, the police are chasing me. Sit tight. We'll get him. Gotcha! Can't run away from me. You really helped us out. I expect you to help me out as well when they withdraw my driver's license. As for all this, I'll send the bill to the Police Department. Well, good luck! Thank you so much. Goro, what is it? What happened? Goro! Roger that. Kurata-san is dead. Mrs Kitamori, hold on. No, I've had enough! I'll look for Goro on my own. I need your help to find Nagayama. No. I refuse to do it. Calm down, please. I am calm. You're the one who're out of your mind. You stink of blood. All your body smells of it. Please, help me. Your colleague's been killed. And you're not even going to his funeral. What kind of person are you? Where are we going? That bastard isn't going to take the main road. He also wants Goro's owner. You're going to use me as a bait? Let's go back. Quiet. You never know when a bullet's going to hit you. You're a monster. Here he is. Get down. Damn. Thank you. I can't stand the smell of blood. Hello? Yes, I know. He's asleep. Is it urgent? I see. Just a minute. Yasutaka-san! Yasutaka-san! What is it? It's for you. Head of Criminal Investigation Department. How did he find out I was here? I notified the Aomori Police Department yesterday. I wanted them to send someone instead of me. Well, here we go. Yasutaka here. Yasutaka! What do you think you're doing? Are you trying to get even with Mr Tozawa? What were you thinking accusing a respected man without any evidence? I do have evidence. The man who helped the two gangsters escape is Tozawa's secretary. Besides, the CZ that they used is the same one... that was used to kill that hostess five years ago. I know about the gun. We've already established that it belongs to a member of the Hashu criminal gang. But there's no proof that Tozawa is connected with it. Think what you're doing! Chief, how many people have died to help this bastard avoid punishment? This time, I'll put an end to it. At least for Kurata's sake. Katsuko! Katsuko! Well done, Goro! Don't worry, she'll be alright. See? She's fine. Thank you all so much. I don't know how to thank you. Don't thank me. It's Goro. Goro? This dog. He's the one you should thank. HANAMAKI DAIRY COOPERATIVE Just a moment. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I don't like photos... Such noble conduct is rare nowadays. I'll write about it in the paper. In the paper? I'm going to Hanamaki. But you need to recover first. I'm sorry. I admire and even envy you. I don't have a purpose in life since my husband died. It's so quiet here. I haven't felt so good in a while now. I can't offer you anything special. But do stay for a couple of days and get some rest. Thank you. Why don't we eat something special tonight? I'd be glad to, but I have to go. Goro and I had a good time here. It's time to go now. At least wait for my daughter to come home from school. Alright. I'll wait for her. It must be Katsuko. Here you are, Nagayama. Stop! Don't do it! Goro, run! Nagayama! Where's that copy? Answer! Goro, run! Where is it? Start talking! Goro! Goro, run! You bastard. Stubborn asshole. ON GORO'S COLLAR Where's Goro? Have you seen him? Mum, I'm home! Is our guest still here? Get the kid away. Yes. Let's go. Quick. Mr Amamura, please be brief. Goro was seen near the swamps. I have to go there immediately. Delegate it to someone else and go back to Hokkaido. Public Security is involved now. They showed up yesterday. They are demanding your dismissal. Disciplinary Council is going to meet in a couple of days. Nonsense. I have no time to report to them. If you don't show up, you'll be dismissed for sure. - They're trying to pressure me. - I don't think so. You're overzealous. We've received complaints that your actions are disturbing the public peace. It's their tricks. It's no accident that... the Head of Criminal Investigation Department, Aizawa himself called me. What did Aizawa want? He wants me to leave Yoichi Tozawa alone. Tozawa? I'm not afraid of his threats and I'm not interrupting my investigation. - Now excuse me. - Hey, Yasutaka! We're continuing out broadcast devoted to the elections. In the first district of the Aomori prefecture, Yoichi Tozawa received 65, 509 votes. Aoki Keizo received 60, 504 votes. - So Yoichi Tozawa won, after all. - Asakawa Takeshi received... The winner is Yoichi Tozawa. Now I know why you're so determined to find Goro. I'm sorry for eavesdropping on your conversation. But what are you going to do if you're dismissed? I'll try to expose them before that. Apparently, Nagayama put something in the capsule on Goro's collar. It's my last hope. I'll find Goro. Thank you. Long live Mr Tozawa! Hurrah! Someone named Mizuki, from the Tokyo Police Department, is helping Yasutaka. Don't worry. Boss has everything under control. He left in the afternoon? He's still not here. Where might he be? Oh, he's here. I'll call you later. I'm sure you heard that people aren't the best creatures in the world. As soon as I came in, I understood that Mizuki is here. I haven't heard your voice in a while. And who's this? Mrs Reiko Kitamori, Goro's owner. - Mizuki. - Nice to meet you. I have some advice for you. Be careful with Mr Yasutaka. When he's engrossed in a case, he gets crazy. Mizuki, let's go see the witness before it gets dark. I've talked to him already. Mizuki, if you're so zealous, you risk losing your job like me. He saw the dog here. Around Tsubonasawa. It came from Hanamaki and was heading south. I think we should look for it somewhere around here, or even further to the south. It has already passed Aomori, Iwate and Miyagi prefectures. Aomori, Iwate and Miyagi... Goro is heading directly for Tokyo... ...faithful to Nagayama's will. What an extraordinary dog. Come here. I'm as lonely as you are. Come on. So you're Goro. That same Goro. You must be hungry. You're going back to Tokyo? All alone? It's so far away. You're such a strong dog. And I don't even know what I live for. What do you have there on your collar? Show me. Don't be so greedy. I see, it must be something very important to you. I can help you get back home. - Thank you for the work. - Goodbye. Say hi to your sister. And treat her to something tasty tonight. The doctor says the same thing. I'm home. Welcome home. Sister, you should be in bed. I'm fine. I wanted to cook something tasty for you. Stop drinking! What else is there left to do? I'm going to die soon anyway. Stop it! Do you want to die sooner? I do it because I'm afraid of death! What is this dog doing here? It's Goro. The one from the papers? Exactly. We might get in trouble because of it. So what? I'll protect him. If only for one day of his life. I'm sorry. I'm being selfish. It's fine. I'm the one who should apologize. You took great care of me. I finished school only because of you. But when I grew up, I couldn't pay you back. We're losers. All the more reason to try to make it work, don't you think? You're right. Yo-chan... I feel cold. Sister, you'd better lie down. Are you alright? Hold on. I'm scared, Yo-chan. Am I going to die like this? We're out of luck. Stay like this. I can hear your heart beating. I can hear blood flowing through your veins. It's like you're pouring life into me. Sister! I don't want to die. I want to be happy. Yo-chan... Hug me tight. Thank you. I... I've never been with a man. Before I die, I want to know what it's like, at least once. You want to...? Yes. I'm starving! Welcome back! By the way, Motomo, do we have any news? - Yes. - Thank you. Yasutaka was here soon after you left. It was reported that Goro is with some woman in Ishinomaki. - He rushed off immediately. - Ishinomaki? Look at this night. Like in movies. It's Goro! Let's go. That way. Goro! Goro, it's me! Don't you recognize me? It's not him. It's not Goro. Sister! - Please, don't leave me! - Yo-chan... Goro... Goro. Take him to Tokyo. Do you hear me? Sister... Sister. Sister! Goro, sit here. I'll come back in a bit. Hey you! Do you have scissors? - What? - To clip nails. Hello. Captain, who's that fishy passenger? I don't know. I took them on board on boss' orders. I just give them food. I don't know anything. How did they get on board? Answer me! Hashu... - The Hashu gang? - Yes. They did me some favors. And I couldn't say no to them. I figured out why you're chasing that dog, Yasutaka. You don't need it. You need what's on its collar, right? I don't know. But you're not going to find that dog now. Who are you anyway? I'm Ryoichi Tanuma. I'm the one who finished off Nagayama. I see. I also took care of his wife and daughter. You mean... that double suicide? You're a monster. But I don't always kill with a gun. Your corpses will surface in Tokyo Bay. You're a demon! A beast! When are you going to get enough of killing? Miss... I like you even more when you're angry. No! If you don't want to, you'll have to die. Don't touch her, Tanuma. Do you care for her? Stop it, please. Yasutaka-san! Why don't you bite your tongue off? You could die an easy death. Tanuma! I promise... ...I'll kill you. What's that? They can't be from customs. Kensei Maru No.2! Kensei Maru No.2! This is Nojima patrol boat. This is Nojima patrol boat. Respond! Respond! Don't move! Kensei Maru No.2! Where are we? Not far from the Ibaraki prefecture. How far is the coast? About 15 miles. Then head to the coast full speed. Do it or I'll shoot you. Yes. Kensei Maru No.2! Respond! Kensei Maru No.2! Stop! Kensei Maru No.2! Respond! Kensei Maru No.2! Kensei Maru No.2! Stop! Turn it off. How? - Do as I say! - Yes. Kensei Maru No.2! Stop immediately! Shit. Kensei Maru No.2! Stop, or we'll shoot. Kensei Maru No.2! Stop immediately, or we'll shoot. Hey you! I have hostages here. If you approach, I'll shoot them. Get off my back, or they'll die. Water-cannons! I repeat! Turn around! Get out of here! Get out! Come over here so they can see you. Hey, assholes! And you dare to say that a man's life is the highest value? I give you 3 minutes. If you don't turn around, I'll shoot this one as well. Hands up! Drop the gun! Come here. The suspect is unarmed, but he's escaped. Get on board. Where are the hostages? Show me. - Come on! - Mizuki! After the lady gets dressed, you'll take her on the boat. Yes. Take this. Give me a hand. Goro! Goro! Goro! How did he get here? Goro! Goro... Shit! Come out! Go ahead! Shoot! I'll take you with me. Run! Step back! Yasutaka-san, let's go! Goro... Goro... Goro, jump! Goro... Yasutaka-san! Please, come inside. Had Goro survived, I wouldn't have lost. You helped me a lot, but I'll probably get dismissed now. Really? That means we're not going to see each other anymore? I wanted to keep fighting till the end with you. It was the only thing that kept me going. But maybe it's for the better. Forget this dirty woman. Stop talking nonsense! - You're not dirty. - Don't lie to me. Don't comfort me. What makes you dirty? Tell me. Are you dirty here? Why do you hide it? What are you ashamed of? It's just a monster's bite. It will disappear. As for your heart, I'll heal it. Yasutaka-san... Madam... Call me Reiko. Mr Tozawa, congratulations on your becoming Minister of Defense. Tell us about your plans. According to the survey conducted by the Prime Minister's office... ...over the past few years, the number of people... who support the Self-Defense Forces has been on the rise. In 1978, their number reached 83 percent. We can't ignore this fact anymore. Hello? Yasutaka here. Oh, it's you, Mizuki? What? You're being transfered? Where are they sending you? To Kumamoto. Your prediction has come true. They think that I had no right to ask Naval Police for help. In other words, you thwarted their plans. By the way, what are you going to do next? I'm going to carry on my investigation. Mizuki, I'll fight them to the end. You'll need convincing evidence. I'll get it, even if I have to break the law. I'm ready for anything. MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE Do you have an arrest warrant? Look. In order to cover your ass, you got your subordinate killed. His wife and child too. You made it look like a suicide. No... Tanuma told me everything. You're lying! I thought people like you didn't whine. You're going to tell me everything. Are you going to talk or not? I'm not joking. I'll shoot. I'll kill you, asshole. Start talking. Don't kill me. I'll tell you everything. Two years ago, we received an unofficial order... ...for a military ship, class DDH, from one of the countries in Southeast Asia. And Tozawa suggested... ...removing the cannons to avoid complications? Yes. And the most part of the 2-billion bribe went to Tozawa, didn't it? Yes. Now they'll kill me like they killed Nagayama. Weren't you ready for this? I'm a dead man. It's not important now. HEAD OF ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT COMMITS SUICIDE It's absolutely clear that he gave this testimony under pressure. Such a recording can't be used as evidence. - Why not? - Do I need to explain it to you? You're an experienced investigator. Do you really believe that this tape can convince anyone? Here. In other words, we have no grounds to arrest Tozawa. What are you talking about? If I were you, I'd back down a bit. No way. I'll expose him. That's all. It's because of that case from five years ago? Is it revenge? You're not young and naive anymore to believe that justice prevails. Leave all this nonsense, and I'll help you. I'm not going to accept any deals. Your dismissal will be discussed in a few days. And I'll have a say in the matter too. If you get dismissed, you'll be blacklisted. If I accept the deal, Tozawa will avoid punishment again. I won't let that happen. You're so naive. Wake up. You're behaving like a child. This sunny spring day, the citizens of Asaka, Saitama prefecture, have come to see the annual military parade. Over 50 thousand people have gathered to look at the new APCs. The new Minister of Defense Tozawa is overlooking the parade. There's a look of pride on his face. And no wonder, since the majority of our citizens support the Self-Defense Forces.
