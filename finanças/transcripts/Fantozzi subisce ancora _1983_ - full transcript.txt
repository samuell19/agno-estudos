FANTOZZI SUFFERS AGAIN Through the alternation of wise governments... ... the Italian people have now reached a high degree of maturity. Workers and employees finally understand... ... that productivity is the basis of social well-being... ... and the only way out of the crisis. - Let us in! - I want to work overtime! Productivity must be increased! - I can't live without my files! - Let's help our country! Let's take the stairs, it'll be faster! The great plagues of absenteeism and second jobs... ... which have caused so much damage to the Italian economy... ... can finally be said to be defeated and done for. # Let's go, let's go, let's go to work! # - Go! Where's your second job? - At the post office. - Give me a lift? I don't have a car. - Don't you work at the registry office? - Yes, but I have three jobs. - Three?! - Yeah. Hello, Cabrini. You didn't look, did you, Antonio? Naughty boy! Wait for me! Good morning, accountant. BLIND - You beg at us too, accountant?! - I try. #Super tanned# #Under the sunshine# #How nice is to dream# #In your arm# #Super tanned# #A short walk from the sea# - This second job business is a scandal! - It's disgusting! Thank you, accountant. CORRADO MARIA LOBBIAM INSPECTOR OF INSPECTORS Hello? What? No, surveyor Mughini is with the Side Director. Wait a moment. Hello? Miss Silvani is... STAMPING OFFICE Everything OK here? Huh? Well... Busy. Busy. - Hello. - Hi everyone. What do you need? Extra strong paper and two-tone ribbons? Well, good job everyone. I'll run up to Stationery to speed up the work. Excuse me. But it goes down! OK'! - What floor is this? - First. - First!? - Yes. - But I have to go to the fifth! Fifth, ouch! - Help! - Fantozzi, hurry up! Welcome back, Miss Silvani. - How was your day at the solarium? - Don't tell me! Like shit, the sun came and went! I'm sorry. I envy you, staying here all nice and quiet. Well, well... Miss Silvani, I've been wanting to tell you for a year... Maybe you didn't notice, but I do all this for you. So you'll do it again tomorrow, "Fantozzino"? I... will do it again tomorrow. I'll do it! - Now go, you stink of sweat! - Go! - Go wash! - Go wash, "Stinky"! - How do you sweat so much? - He's got a plebeian metabolism. - Wash! Ten hut! - Who is missing here? - Fantozzi! Hello, Fantozzi here, who's talking? Ugo, what is it? What have they done to you? Nothing, Pina, don't worry, I have to work some overtime. - Then go get Mariangela from work. - Yes, I'll stop by after. No, I can't move now. I AM AN ABSENTEE Hi Dad. Hello! - Good morning. - Excuse me, can I help you? - I came to get... - You too? That's not for sale, it's the saleswoman! She is not a monkey. - What? Are you crazy? That's my baby girl. - She is not a baboon! - She's a saleswoman! - She's my baboon! That is, my daughter. Mariangela, go change. Do you realize you treated my daughter as if she were a monkey? Okay, goodbye. Mariangela, come. Dad'll get you out of here. I've already applied to the post office. This is not a place for you. Hey! What are you doing? You trying to be funny? Take your own! It's that I confused them... They are similar... Here you go! - What? - I'm sorry. You want this one. Dad was joking. Let's go home. - Pina, open up! - Here I am. - I don't have the keys. Are the spaghetti ready? - No. Wait up. Don't you remember what day it is? What? No! - They're all here. - All of them? - Yes. All right. - Let's not dramatize. Where is Mariangela? - Here I am. - Ah, yeah. Save yourself, barricade yourself in the toilet. Exit at the agreed signal. - Do you remember? - The eagle's cry. - No, the owl's cry! - I'm going. - Be careful. - Don't overdo it, I've been through worse. - Mariangela, give dad a kiss. - Wait up! I am not prepared. - Go away! - Here we go. - Owl, remember! - Good evening. - Good evening. It was the terrifying condominium meeting... ... which took place in turns in the home of each tenant. - We made you president this time. - Yeah. - Me? Then I declare the session open! You never close the elevator! - You're in arrears! - And you're a cuckold. - You still have to pay three installments. - Here they are. One, two and three! - Four five six! - And seven! Go downstairs and see the porter's lodge, you're the administrator! - He went! - And you keep the TV down! I declare the session closed. - Goodbye. - Good evening. At the beginning of the following summer, an exceptional event occurred. So exceptional that the employees gave up absenteeism... ... and stayed in the office to work. - Those are easy questions. - No, they're not easy. This week's prize is a camper. - So fucking lucky. - Do not be vulgar. Madam, will you drive it all alone? Do you think I have problems? Do you want to greet someone? I want to send a kiss to my colleagues who are watching me. They inspired me to participate in this game. - There's Lobbiam! - Go! Quick! - Good morning, Excellency. - Good morning. Miss Silvani's win... ... unleashed an organizational burst by accountant Filini. He had organized a caravan holiday... ... each with their own caravan. Fantozzi and Filini went to collect them... ... in the tragic labyrinth of the sales park. By a chilling coincidence... ... both on the same day, at the same time and for the same model. On the morning of departure, in front of Ms. Silvani's door... ... People showed up as follows: accountants Colzi and Mughini. Driving together to reduce expenses, while still saving privacy. Miss Silvani! Hi! Calboni, passing off an old ambulance as a camper... ... which he rented from an unscrupulous stretcher bearer friend of his. And as a Bourbon noblewoman, his traveling companion... ... a well-known hooker from Bari. Ironically called the Countess for her aristocratic ways. Then Filini arrived... ... who had opted for an El Alamein-style armored car... ... a remnant of the Second World War. Here I am! - Hello! - Wonderful! Hello, we are all here! Are you ready to go? - Only Fantozzi is missing. - Damn. As usual. - There he is! Here comes! Fantozzi! We're here! Come, what are you doing there? - They're calling us, let's go. - Yes, also... - Yeah... - Let's go. "Eye, evil eye, parsley and fennel"! - Parsley and fennel... - Well, we're all here! Start your engines, everyone follow me! Onward! - Where are you going? - What? I'm going to say hi! Good morning, I came to greet you before departure. I take this opportunity to pay homage with this little gift. It's a Saint Christopher magnet, he's the protector of camper drivers. Won't you open it? Ugo! I want to remind you that I am here too, your wife! Poor thing! She wanted to come too because she is jealous of us. - What are you saying? - She's jealous of me and you, you know... You? Ah! Sorry, but that's like being jealous of a toad. What? Who spoke? When we are ready in line, let's all honk. Silvani's horn, Calboni's siren, Colzi and Mughini's horn. Fantozzi's horn and Filini's horn! - Honk your horn, warn him. - Are you crazy? If he answers us we're screwed. I'll get to the back of the line as soon as I can. - Wait! Where are you going? - Stop him! - Sir! After that painful accident Ms. Silvani took the lead. To avoid further trouble. What happened? She must have hit a manure truck. Can I help you? Do you want a ride? Come. Get in! Let's go! - What is she doing? Is she crazy? - Why? Didn't you see what she picked up? She is such a young girl. A girl like that, picking up a jailbird like that. I begged you not to worry about her, at least in my presence. - Look, I... - And that young man doesn't look like a jailbird. No? What then? I would say a nice and poetic globetrotter. Franco here says he can take us to a fantastic place... ... somewhere he only knows and where nobody ever goes. #Taste of salt# #Taste of sea# #You have on your skin# #You have on your lips# It has its own charm. - Nice, isn't it? - It's wonderful! I love the wild outdoors. We owe this paradise to "Franchino" who brought us here. - "Franchino"! - She calls him "Franchino"? - Why not? - Come. Meet all my friends. Are you OK? - Will "Franchino" stop with us? - Sure. - He has his own sleeping bag. - Super idea! Grilled fish! - Hurray! You are all my guests tonight! The men will take care of the fish and we girls will cook! Brava! Good idea! I'll organize everything myself. Fantozzi, you and I will take care of the raw material. - We're going to make wood. - There is a grove up there. Get the rod and line. I'll call Calboni. Get moving! - Accountant Calboni! - What's up? - Let's go fishing! - Fishing? - There, on the dock. - Ah! - Do you have a rod? I do have a "rod", and I was using it. When you see the red light, it means I'm diving you shouldn't bother me! I apologize. Accountant Fantozzi, what are you doing? Come on, let's move! - It's that he has... - Come on, how bad can it be! - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. - Go! - Go! What did you do? I got something! - I got something too! - Pull! How's the miracle catch going? Well, we've already taken 8, all of the same type, pretty fat. Nine! - God, that's disgusting! - But they're sewer rats! I had had the suspicion. You're the usual pig, go fishing offshore, you filthy fools! - Yes, take my boat. - Eh... Let's do something, throw these mice away. But what rats and mice! Fantozzi, please, not you too! There is the dogfish, the catfish and the ratfish, people may not like it. In any case, I personally love grilled ratfish! But since you say so, let's throw this goodness overboard. Here, happy? Accountant, come! Be quick, it could get dangerous. I'll come right away, I'll put the alarm on. - You see? I saved the engine. - Yes, good, good. I'm afraid it got wet. Could you set it in motion? Yes, let's try it. Ah! - My apparatus! Turn it off! - Yes, stand still. Here. It's off. It's not like you really needed it. - What's up? - There must be a rotten whale around here. But where? Seven, in one go... Clean the octopus at least. Mullets, an octopus, how unoriginal. - But.... - It's still alive, who's going to kill it? - You. - Me? Me, all right then... Asshole! You let that asshole catch y-- That... Hurray! Hooray! Oh, you don't drink. If it was for those two... ... we would eat dead rats like in the siege of Stalingrad. - A glass for two. Ma'am? - I don't drink. - You don't drink. Luckily our "Franchino" took care of the fish! So I propose a hurray for our "Franchino"! - Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray! Hooray! No, huh? There is only one way to properly end an evening like this... ... let's go skinny dipping! - Wonderful! Who's with us? - If you do it, I will too. - Me too! - Pina? - Yes. - Sorry, but... - You're my wife. - The wife of a shitty bourgeois like you. Wait up. How dare you, excuse me? You can swim naked and she can't? It is completely different. I know how to conduct my relationship with her. You know nothing! You don't even know what world you live in. You know why? - You lack culture. - Look, I have a diploma. - Why, are you cultured? - I am an accountant! - So let's see. - What are you doing? So... Literary, scientific or pop culture? Three envelopes, right? I have to choose one... Pop culture. No! There's a toilet bowl... Okay... What is the prostate? Yes, well, it's easy. It is said of a very "prostate" woman... So, I was saying that it's a woman in the state of... I mean... - Eh! - No, here, I remember! It's a dessert, my mom used to make it too, it's the "prostate". It can be made from blueberries or pears. It's the Roman emperor, the Byzantine heresiarch, Julian the "prostate". - What about the kibbutz? - It's easy. The meaning of kibbutz... It is a dialect expression used by the farmers of Alberobello. When people knock really hard on the door of the trullo... ... The farmers, all frightened, say: "Kibbutz?". Now do you realize what kind of shit you are? Ugo, I'm going to take a bath naked. Fantozzi spent the worst 10 minutes of his life. Then, suddenly, as sometimes happens to those who are too unhappy... ... the situation turned in his favor. - You and I are in love with the same man. - So? I wanted to tell you that you have won, Miss Silvani. Tonight I realized that I am no longer of age to fight. I'll leave him to you go ahead and take him. I don't need your permission or your sacrifice. I'll take him whenever I want! Tonight! - Here I am! - What are you doing? Why don't you knock? You were expecting me, right? Take me! I'm going to take my brush and smash your head! Get out of my camper! Sorry... Why put up a show? My wife agrees too. Look, I heard everything, she said she would leave me all to you. You heard everything, but you didn't understand anything. - You think your wife has nobody else to give up on? - What... Who? Ah! I see. Good night. Hi. What was the water like? Chill. Did you love him very much? I don't know, I would have to try at least once. It wasn't love, then? I don't know, I told you. Yes, okay, you don't know... But if someone asks you, out of pure curiosity... ... who is the man you loved the most in your life... Pina, I'm sorry, but what do you feel for me? Huh? Ugo, for you I only feel... Yes, I know, I know. You just feel a little tenderness. No, Ugo, just a little pity. What... Pity? Ah... In addition to the couple crisis, the tragedy of unfulfilled desires... ... other hard trials awaited Mr and Mrs Fantozzi. Hi, Pina. You're still not ready? It's 8:30 pm, I'm terribly hungry. Be patient, I'm tired, I've been working all day. Come on, I just said I'm hungry. It's not for you, it's for Mariangela, her cycle has stopped. - Her bicycle broke, it's not a tragedy. - She doesn't have it anymore! - It got stolen! Holy shit...! - Her menstruation has stopped! But how, I'm sorry... Does Mariangela even have everything like... - But Ugo! She is a child like any other. - Well, mostly... - See this colored circle? - Where? - Here! - It means that Mariangela is pregnant. - Now? But I'm hungry. -Ugo, she is pregnant! - Well then, of course...! Who are we "pregnant" with? Poor. She didn't want to tell me. She's in the room. She is afraid of you. - Ugo? - What? Come on, you know I'm a civilized, modern father. I want to address this issue alone, with understanding and gentleness. I got it? Let me do it alone. No, dad! Help! I'll kill you! I'll break you in two! Stop! Poor little girl! Love, it's nothing. Mariangela... Is she breathing? Is this your way of being a civilized and modern dad? Only at 11 did Mariangela confess that the seducer was a colleague. A certain Loris Batacchi. They decided to visit him at home. They had devised a brilliant ploy to make him confess... ... and confront him with his responsibilities. (with a Romagna accent) I am coming, how impatient you are! I'm already hard! Sorry, I was expecting a hot chick. Can I help you? We are two members of the Youth Protection Committee... So you know where to find the good stuff. Come in, I'm interested. Sit down, ma'am, don't be afraid. Allow me. Loris Batacchi. - What are you doing? - The hand kiss. And the girls? - What?! - We're doing research. - On the greatest danger to young women. - The seducers. - You got lucky. You have reached the top. Please sit down. If there was an institute of seducers, I would be president for life. 6000 victims, almost the population of Sant'Arcangelo di Romagna. - My congratulations. - Well deserved, in all modestly. This is optional, I have all the accessories. Here you go, have fun. Take it, it doesn't bite! It's a bit messy here. But this is like an office for me, my work room. Feel free to ask me without remission, I don't mince words. I mince... - No! - You know what I mean? - Can you tell me about this... - We'll give this to the lady to have fun with. - No, I'll put it here. Can you tell me where you work? I work at the post office, parcel office manager. - Wait! - It was to better explain the concept. Could it be explained with a style more suited to a lady? - I can't explain it better! - Do you know Miss Fantozzi? - Mariangela Fantozzi. - Mariangela "Fantossi"? - Fantozzi. - "Fantossi"? - Fantozzi. - Yes, with a "Z", I got that! Let me look at my file cabinet, where I keep the good stuff. - What are your duties? - Parcel office manager. - Okay, you already said that! - Here you are, Fantozzi Mariangela. She is a colleague of mine, a subordinate of mine. And you would be of the Youth Protection? Come on, you must be from Animal Protection! - What is this? How ugly she is! - She's a type. A type? Yes, a type of monkey. The ugliest type in Europe. I remember, it was a desperate undertaking, a satisfaction. I bet my friends a million that I would go with the orangutan. - It's Mariangela. - This is an orangutan, not a Mariangela. I'll tell you. I did it in the dark, I couldn't do it with the light on. I took her to the bag warehouse. It was dark, there was a storm outside, I put it there and I gave it in! I was shooting blind, but I must've caught her, I trusted the beast. - You mean Mariangela. I mean, the girl. - No, my "water snake". I told her that inside the package was the "water snake". It's a cobra that swells its head and snaps out. And it never stops. - The lady knows, huh? - Ugo, please intervene. - Look. - Yes. I remind you to use a more civilized language with my wife. - Why? - She's not used to these "snake" stories. We'll get her used to it immediately! No problem. No! It's that my wife and I are Mariangela's parents. - Of the orangutan? - This lady is my wife. Is the lady the mommy? Look what a beautiful mommy here! How are you, beautiful? You must be one who doesn't get laid much. - But I'm here now. Beautiful mommy! You must be 48, 49 years old. - 44. A good week of therapy and I'll change your hair color. - I'll make you blonde if I get you up here. - Please... Do you know what they call me? The "Mad Spatulator". I can drive the lady mad. She'll change completely. I have a collection of pornographic prints with all the positions. I call it the "Stations of the Cross". "I'll stop her at all stations until we get to the end of the line." You rascal! Go do these "stations" with your sister! - That's right. - You have a sister, too? - What?! Bring her here too! The more, the merrier! - Stop it. - I will "spatulate" your little sister too. - How dare you! You know what I, the "Spatulator", am going to do to you? I'll take the lady and her sister and put them here. Be careful. I'll take them like this and tear everything off from both of them. Then I'll put them here, one on each side, And I'll "spatulate" them! - Come along too! - No! - It'll drive you crazy! - I'm leaving! - No, stay! I'll add you to my archive. - No! - Do you have a photo? - Leave me! - Don't enable him! I "spatulate" because I am a man with cojones! - Let's go! - But we're pregnant. I mean, what about Mariangela? - Will you give her to someone like that? - Even more difficult, let's add this! - All off! - No. You know what I tell you? - We don't care about your "cahoneys". - Cojones. - Or your "Spatula". Goodbye! - That's right! - Look, would it really drive me crazy? - Walk! - Sorry. In order not to create a single mother... ... they appealed to the Maternity Interruption Act. Fantozzi made an appointment with Professor Gandini. A gynecologist recommended by a janitor of a local bocce club. Do you want to make a deal? I have a fresh liver of the day. A newly transplanted heart. - No, I'm not interested. - It's now or never. - You may need it some day! - I sell blood of every type. I also have RH negative. To free himself from the siege he bought the cheapest thing. Two liters of rigged urine to avoid military service. Look... He had drained his bank account... ... because in that environment it's important to grease the wheels. - Excuse me... - Ten thousand. Here, I brought the envelope with my savings. Here are ten thousand. - I have an appointment with professor... - Thirty thousand. ... Saraceni. One, two and three. - The professor is on vacation. - But first I gave you 10, now 30... I have to send them to the professor in Cortina by money order. - By money order... - In fact, give me 500 lire for the postage. Right, sorry. I'll give you 10 so you can give me change. Look, you put them under... She doesn't make change. I'll take this opportunity to ask you who the substitute is, so we're even. - OK, Dr. Giovanni Rava. - Where is he? - He's on strike. - On strike? - Is yours an urgent case? - My... - One hundred thousand. I'm desperate... So he discovered that in urgent cases the head of gynecology... ... was Professor Grandi, head of orthopedics. - On this level, after radiology. - After radiology... Very kind. Have a good day, Miss. - Good day. - Good day. - There he is! - Professor! - It's not me. Silence, enough, go! Can't you see it's not the professor? Can't you see he's a poor handicapped man? Come, dear. - Come on, I'll take you to your ward. - Actually there is a misunderstanding... - Now come to your room. - I have to go. - We'll take good care of you. - Calm down! Come! - Release my arm! Sister, let me go! Excuse me, huh! What are you doing! Come on! Sister! Sister... You are lucky, you are all lucky! Doctors are checking you with sophisticated equipment. The latest discoveries in the field of technology. Don't worry. Good job. - Sorry, can you tell me... - Silence! - Come on! - Come on! - 157 thousand points! I won! - Pay up! One moment. Here it is. THE DOCTOR IS OUT IN THE WARD - Here. - Thanks. Excuse me, could you tell me where the ward is? - Are you asking me? - Why, are you not a porter? Me? I'm the pizza chef on Via della Scrofa. I came here to visit my mother who is very sick. The handicapped! No, you again... - Here! -You could get hurt. - Come to the ward! - No, which ward? - Wait! - I'll show you below. - No! - Did he take everything? - Yes. -Well, but...- You're right. - It will take some time. - We should keep him longer. Excuse me, Mr. Professor, Engineer, Mahatma Grandi. - Excuse me? - What are those? - That's 50 thousand lire. - How dare you? Put them away. - I'm sorry... - What do you want? I'm here for an abortion. No, it's for my monkey-- I mean, my daughter. - No, never! - But thanks to Pannella we can... I am a Catholic, a conscientious objector and above all an orthopedic. Therefore totally ignorant of the matter. Yes, but they told me that you are replacing the gynecologist. I do what I can. But I have a high percentage of bad events. - What? - Wait for Professor Marini to come back. - What do I do in the meantime? - Book a bed. - How long does it take? - Hopefully, two years. Two years? But a pregnancy only takes nine months. - Oh yes? - You don't know that? - I told you I'm an orthopedist. - It's true. - Then it's urgent. Do you have a million? - Wait. Yes. - Let me see it. - Excuse me, one question. - Earlier, 50 thousand lire weren't... - It was only 50 thousand lire! - Who did you take me for, a porter? - Here. No! I don't touch them. You are all witnesses. Give them to the sister. - Bye dear. - Good day. - Put him in the single. - Then... The room where he slept to keep his bed was not a single. It was the dreaded operating room of Professor Zambrini Loredan. Also known as "Jack the Ripper". - What happens? - Shut up. - Have mercy. - Keep calm, don't get upset. - There's a misunderstanding, I'm here for-- - We know why you're here. What do you want to do to me? Don't be like that, I have a weak bladder. Good! Bravo! - Scalpel. - What? What are you doing? - What should we operate? - I don't know. - File! - Professor, I don't have a file. - There's no file in the archive. - There's no file? - No. It seems to me that we need to amputate something that ends in "er". Er, er, er... finger! - Amputation of the finger. Good. Saw! - No, a finger!? Ah! - Good. - Not the finger. But it could also be the shoulder. Finger, shoulder... - When in doubt, I'll do both of them! - No, please... At the reception they said it was something that ended in "al blockage". But guys! Then it could be an intestinal blockage. Anal blockage, renal blockage, Postal blockage! - Shut up! - Excuse me. - Wait! Yes, here it is! - The file. - Brava! Beautiful! Good! So perky! - Oh yes! - Professor! - What are you doing! - I had a moment... It's the heat of the lamp. - The file. The card belonged to Vincenzo Bacellari, known as Frou Frou. A known transvestite, hospitalized to make his dream come true... ... to become a woman in all respects. - It's like a doll. - Ah, there it is. - 01 Scissors. - Here. - Give me the lens. To denounce the tragic mistake and get back the extorted goods... ... he wrote a plea to the President of the Republic. Only thanks to this intervention... ... he was returned his precious pleasure equipment. Which was about to be transplanted as a little toe... ... to a carpenter from Val di Susa. When Fantozzi was discharged, Mariangela's time had run out. Ah, dad, mom, it's moving! Where, who is moving? Ah! It tapped! Let me feel it. It's really tapping. Two days later, labor came. Here it is, can you hear it? Wait here, I'm going to meet him. Here, around the corner, come! Fantozzi was forced to take the porters to the hospital. There it is! There it is! Did you see what a handsome boy, Mr. Rossi? - Mr. Rossi? - Isn't that you? - No, my name is Fantozzi. I'm sorry. Who is Mr. Rossi? It happens often. Your turn is next. Don't worry, childbirth is a natural thing. Being born is beautiful, beautiful! - What will this baby be like? - Very beautiful! Do you remember how cute Mariangela was when she was born? Quick, the doctor passed out! - Oh God! - What did the doctor... Here it is! - Yes! - Yes, that's us. What is she doing? Ah! What's that? What is it, Pina? - And for our grandfather, hip hip... - Hooray! - Bravo! - Congratulations! You haven't told us yet... is it a boy or a girl? - Doctors haven't decided yet. - Ah here. - Does it look like you? - No, it doesn't look like me at all. At least tell us what it's like. Describe it to us! - It, this... - Baby. Newborn. It starts... it has a whole... - A nose. - No, this is the back part. - The back nose? - Yes, because you can also... - Flip. - Yup. And he has all of the... - Bumps. - No. - Is it a bird? - No. - It's... - A trumpet. - It plays the trumpet! - No. - Don't you have a photo? - Exactly. - With the trumpet. - Let us see. - Good. - Here. - Here. - Let us see it better. - I just don't remember... - I told my wife to mark it. - Maybe like that. - How? - Here. - You think so? What are you doing? What is this little group? - We're looking at the picture of... - Let me see! - Do you want to? - Yup! - No... - Ah! For 20 years, accountant Fonelli, a lover of athletics... ... who as a young man had been a poor 400 meter runner... ... had been trying in vain to organize meetings of his favorite sport. Accountant, we have decided to all sign up for the same race. - Very well, what race? - The asshole toss. Let me go! Put me down! Rascals! Go away! Go and play football, which isn't even good for you! Go to the stadium to watch the games. You don't understand anything! - Athletics is the queen of sports. - Fonelli! - What's going on? - Thieves! - It's not my car. - Not mine either. - What is that? - A burglar alarm? - It's not a car. - It comes from up there, it's an apartment alarm. - Quiet! - We want to sleep! - That's enough! - Get it over with, unplug it! It wasn't an alarm. It was the cry of Mariangela's creature. It always did that on nights of full moon. Her family knew this, and they had taken precautions. So they didn't even hear the phone. It was his colleague Filini... ... trying to give Fantozzi the most terrifying of news. Through a series of spies, blackmail, accessions to the mafia... ... to the Camorra, to P2... ... and with 4 lifetime subscriptions to "Christian Family"... ... the harmless and humble accountant Fonelli... ... had been suddenly appointed mega natural director of personnel. And he had taken the name of Cobram the 2nd. I am pleased to see that you now agree with your Fonelli... ... about the beauty of amateur sport... ... on the need for it, on the theories of Marquis de Coubertin... ... because athletics is the queen of sports. Fonelli! The queen of sports! I propose the asshole toss! - How did you dress? As a general manager? - Fantozzi... ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OFFICE FOR KICKBACKS AND STRING-PULLING OFFICE FOR ROBBERIES AND BLACKMAIL OFFICE FOR ACCIDENTS Look, here comes Grandpa. I declare the first Company Games open. And remember, the important thing here is not to participate, it is to win! To the first-placed team... ... no prizes, no hymns, no honors, no cups will be awarded! Conversely, the participants of the bottom ranked team... ... will all be transferred to our Sasso Strittu mine... ... in Carbonia, Sardinia. to be employed as pack mules. Athletes, go ahead! It started with the 100-meter flat. - We're in your hands. - Don't get me out of focus. - Sorry. Fantozzi is always in the middle. At the starting points, ready! High jump, Accountant Fantozzi is on the platform. Surveyor Filini, please get ready. Hop! Hop! Wait. Excuse me! Excuse me! I have to jump. Ah! Results: Bribes 7... ... Blackmail 6, Administration 2, Accidents zero. At your seats, ready... Pole vault, accountant Fantozzi on the platform... ... Surveyor Filini of the Accidents office, Dr. Paternò. - What are you doing up there? - Isn't this pole climbing? - But no! It's the pole vault, come down. - So it doesn't count... Surveyor Filini on the platform. At the twenty-seventh false start, the starter committed suicide. Fantozzi was forced to spontaneously replace him. - Ready, go! - Valid start. After the 100 meters: Bribes 9... ... Blackmail 7, Administration 5, Accidents zero. Then the shot put. - Get in here and shoot, see where you have to shoot? - Yes. - Come on. - A nice shot! Let's see. - Mine! - No, I don't think so. - Let's check. - It's ours. - No, take a closer look. 3000 meters steeplechase race. Be good! - Don't push. - Accountant! - Come on! - Help! - My foot! - Accountant, stop it. - Leave us alone! Fantozzi shamefully tried to turn it into a 50m breaststroke race. Meanwhile, the women's sector didn't give appreciable results either. Wait a minute, I'm not ready yet. I have to concentrate like Simeoni. One moment. Oh God! WORLD RECORD - Hey! You have to start! - Who? - You! - Me? - Go! Galloping! What happened? Accountant Fantozzi, ouch! It hurts. Accidents Office, disqualified in the long jump. Have you seen how many dangerous objects pass by? Where? Accountant! Hammer throw, athlete Fantozzi on the platform. Good morning. Huh? No? This isn't good?. OK... This weighs! Not that, huh? How do you do it? First throw for Fantozzi. Null! Second throw for Fantozzi. Second throw for Fantozzi. Third throw for Fantozzi. Valid. The general standings before the last race:... ... Bribes 16 points, Blackmail 14... ... Administration 7, Accidents zero. In order not to remain at zero and be transferred to Carbonia... ... Filini devised a system to win the last race at least. The 4 x 100 relay, which was worth 20 points. It was just a tragic ploy to force himself to run faster. A chilling draw had taken place in the toilets... ... for the spot of last runner. The luckiest, Fantozzi, was the winner! Fly, "Puccettone", fly! Watch out, it'll blow up! Run away! - Look how fast dad's running. - Yes. Dad came first! And finally came the election, an early one, of course. Fantozzi, who deeply felt his right and duty as a citizen... ... participated in the uncertainty and fear of making another mistake. He started reading everything from the far right to the left. - You're only missing "Sardinian trade". - Give it to me. - 50 thousand. Then he called in sick and shut himself up in the TV room. - What's up? - Do you want a snack? - Can't you see I'm watching? But you haven't eaten in two days. Pina, If I vote wrong, we won't eat for ten years! Out! Go! - All right. - And make me a very strong coffee. - Yup. From morning to evening, he didn't miss a single rally. Neither a four-party debate, nor a ping pong, nor a round table. On all existing channels, private or public, on all 3 his TV sets. Tossed by all that conflicting information... ... he soon entered a state of most complete confusion. And he began to suffer from audio-visual hallucinations. MARCO PANNELLA: Fast with me, Fantozzi. It'll be a perfect demonstration against these party-cratic frauds. It's a great idea: the leader and the last fool on the base. Me and you. I'll only drink cappuccinos and you'll pay for them. You are a professional, you are used to fasting... SPADOLINI: I am not historically inclined to fasting. It shows... But I agree with Mr Pannella... ... that you are historically doomed to fast. - Limiting consumption. - Even more? - Sure! Punch another 5 holes on your belt while I go to my mansion... ... and I make myself a nice breaded cutlet with french fries. DE MITA: I ask for your consent from the ever-more-relative majority party. Especially in the interest of your mental health. After 40 years of Christian Democratic abuse you are now a "DC addict". - Exactly. - What will you do without the blessed Senator Fanfani... ...the beneficial gnome of his hearth? And without the holy Marian Rumor? - Good morning . - And without Mr Rognoni? - For many years Minister of the Interiors? - That's why he's called that! - Vote DC, or you will have a lethal withdrawal crisis. - Lethal?! - Don't listen to him, comrade! - Hello. BERLINGUER: You are the prototype of the exploited. You have to change! - Hairdo? - You have to renew yourself, you have to change your exploiter. You've tried them all, I ask you to try us too. - I assure you, we're second to none. - You too... LONGO: If you strengthen my party, I will solve the pension problem. - Thanks. - Don't you thank me! I'm talking about MY pension. - I am already of a certain age and I have a dependent mother. - Excuse me! - Do you want me to maintain your mom? - No! - Yes indeed! - Don't touch my mom! Look me in the eye. - Don't look at me like that. ALMIRANTE: Let me have your address, I'll send you some comrades... ... to gift you a bottle of castor oil to clarify your ideas. Can't it be postponed? IOTTI: What do I think of Fantozzi? As a woman I find him as repulsive as a toad. You too? BENVENUTO: We are very afraid of this autumn and winter. - What is there to do, dear Fantozzi? - If you ask me, I-- Me, Lama and Carniti have decided to fight to the limit... ... to get ourselves invited to Agnelli's yacht for a cruise... ... in the Mediterranean or the Seychelles or Bermuda. I never come. CRAXI: The serious problem is stability. If you vote for me, I will stably sit in Palazzo Chigi. And I'd try not to move, not even with cannon fire. Excuse me Duce, no, Honorable, but what advantages do I get from it? ANDREOTTI: All parties promise you economic improvements... ... that have never been and never will be. Never! We could not disappoint you because we assure you of a stable deterioration. But you too had promised last time, and then... Mine, as you know, are sailor's promises. - It's true, I always fall for it. - Good. Excuse me, I'll listen to some radio. - MUSSOLINI: Comrade Fantozzi! - It's him. Demo-plutocratic powers, through their sanctions... ... try to prevent the reappearance of the empire! - (De Mita) Decide DC! - Vote for me. Comrade Fantozzi! - Vote for me! - The Ivy! - PSD! - PC! Among so many contradictions, and discordant bells... ... Fantozzi matured his own personal political decision. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Here are the voter IDs. - Excuse me. - Give me your ID. Driver's license. Here. - Fantozzi. - "Fantocci". - Booth one. - Booth number one. - Booth two. - Thanks. - Two. - Booth three. - Thanks. - Go, I'm going to one. I'm going to one. Here you go. - Here. Thanks. - Thanks. Take a seat. Fantocci voted. But... - May I? - Go ahead. Busy. - But... what are you doing? - I'm voting. - Good. Finally, in the heat of the new summer... ... a day of peace and quiet came for Fantozzi, too. A series of forest fires is devastating Italy... ... the firefighters pour tons of water on the flames. - It's not very hot. What are you doing? - A sweater. - You see? - For the... With the tentacle holders. - You like it? - I'm going for a nice swim. - Watch out. - So maybe I'll get some fish. - Watch out. Have you seen how it plays with all its tentacles? What is it doing? - Digging a little hole. - Be careful not to break something. Now stay calm, listen to mom! That's enough! That's enough! That's enough! I'm going out to sea! Ugo! Ugo, where are you going?
