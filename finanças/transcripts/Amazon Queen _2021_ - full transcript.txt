All of it. Come on! Let's go! Get the case. Let's go. It's okay, guys? Change of plan. But the money on the seat or I'll kill your brother. Piece of shit. If something happens to him I'll track you down and I'll kill you. Shut the door. I'm sorry, brother. Lo siento. You'll be okay. Don't worry about it. -What are you doing? -Money... They took it all. My brother is on the plane, stupid. I put a tracker on the plane. Don't worry about it. -Yeah. -Let's go. Hey, hey. I once ran a tour boat on the greatest river in the world; the Amazon. My mom and I owned the river boat "Tucano". We called her "The Queen". But my mom's gone now and my dad died when I was a kid. It's easy to fall in love with the beauty of the Amazon. The forest, the river, the wildlife. It's also easy to fall in love with someone who values Amazon as much as I did. It happened to me with a man by the name of Flynn. Never really said much about his past and he was a little mysterious in that way, so I never really asked. We just want to make the time we had together last as long as we could. I've come to know the jungle pretty well. Doesn't care if you love it, doesn't care about you at all. And it will eat you alive if you're not careful. I guess that's the big difference between the Amazon and people. Are we so cautious and so fearful of the jungle? It's not the jungle we must fear the most. To survive here, you have to know who you can count on and who you can really trust. And for Flynn and I we still work together, but well, we just couldn't make the romance part work. The world is screwed up, man. You're telling me? Mmm... I was just there. Virus, fires... burning forest cattle companies, leaders... I take no pleasure in pulling the stuff. You're a reporter? Interesting work. Hey, the name's Flynn. I am Romero. What are you doing in Manaus, Flynn? I got a tour boat company with a... ...a friend. We've actually got a boat running up the river tomorrow with a bunch of clients. Really? You think you'd be interested in having some promotional photography done up on your trip? I can shoot these photos, add the stories... What do you think of that? Free of charge. Free is good. What's in it for you? Well, I can get more material for a big Amazon deforestation article I'm finishing. What do you think? Trade-off for services? Sounds like a deal. Why don't you come on down to the floating dock tomorrow around 1pm? -What should I look for? -Look for the Tucano? I'll let the boss know. And I'll be there. You got it, man. Flynn, this is the second notice on the boat mortgage. What happened? I'm fine, Jack. Are we gonna be able to get underway tomorrow? She's burning hot, losing a lot of oil. Okay, well, what if you make a patch-- Jack, I got it. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Can we just put all this behind us, please? This whole walk on eggshells for the next five days just isn't gonna work. Let's make this as peaceful as possible, please. Sure, Jack. All right. I'll go pick up some customers. Hey, I'm Jackie. You must be Maggie and Leilah. Welcome to Brazil. Very nice to meet you. I'm sorry. It's going to take some time to get used to it. I love this heat. It's a nice contrast to where we came from. Well, I'm sure you're both exhausted. What was it? A 20 hour journey to get here? It was challenging. The masks, the goggles, the hand sanitizing, everything. But I'm really excited to be here. So, my late husband and I adopted Leilah. We promised each other that we would show her the world. A week on the Amazon will be a great escape. There's nothing like the raw power of nature to just be clear mind and reset. It's an incredible experience, to say the least. But hey, let's get you inside. I have you both all checked in and ready to go. -So, you actually live here? -Yeah. And do you ever miss the States? No, not really. Excuse me, but um, are the rooms in the hotel air conditioned? Mom, stop. If they aren't, we'll get acclimated faster, right? That is very cute. And once we're on the ship, we won't need these. That's great news. But get some rest tonight. I'll be back at 8am to pick you both up. -Eight o'clock! -All right, thanks. Dammit. The stopped moving. The plane must have crashed. I hope your brother's okay, boss. -That's in the river. -What river? The Rio Negro. Pass me the map. This is the Rio Negro. Yes, it is. Expedition cruises. Tucano. Looks like we're going on a tour. -Good morning. -Good morning. How's your first night in Manaus? -I hope you enjoyed the palace. -Oh, the palace... Well, it's a little rurn-down to be perfectly honest. -It was just fine. -Fine? My back is killing me. -The mattress-- -I liked it. Well, I think you'll love your stay on the boat. But first I have a tour plan. So let's show you some sites. -Let's do it. -Let's go. And this is my favorite part of the city. The Manaus Opera House. Or we call it the Jewel of the Jungle. Well, ahoy, Maggie and Leilah. Welcome aboard. And ladies, your stay in room number three. It's just down this hall. -Let me help you with those. -Oh, thank you. There you go. -Please. -Thank you. Who are these guys? They showed up this morning and paid in cash. And well, we kind of need it. Lucky us. Paulo! -Hello and welcome. -Hello. -May I have your bag? -No, no, thank you. -Cabin number five, please. - Obrigado. Hello, I'm Jackie. Captain of the Tucano. Oh, I'm Romero. You are the journalist Flynn told me about, right? That's right. Beautiful vessel. A little old, but we love our Amazon Queen. Well, we welcome you aboard, Mr. Romero. And I have to say it, it's nice to meet someone who cares so much about what's happening to rainforest -and the ecology of our region. -Thank you. I am passionate about it. Flynn might have told you also that I'm completing an article about the Amazon deforestation. -Yes, he did. -Oh. Thank you for having me aboard. Thank you for being here. -You're in cabin number four. -Got it. Hey, welcome aboard everyone. I'm Captain Flynn, co-captain of the vessel, the Tucano, our Queen of the Amazon. We'll begin with the life preservers. I want everybody to put it over your head, tie it around your back and make sure your whistle is available to use. All right, let me give you a hand. Thank you. Sir, can you get in on this, please? This really concerns everyone. With all due respect, capita√£o, I grew up on this river. I just want to get going. -It's matter of procedure. -Thank you, Flynn. And thank you all for choosing the Tucano. This ship has been in my family for over 30 years now, taking thousands of passengers into the Amazon for a life-changing experience. I trust it will be a memorable trip for you as well. But I'm sure you're all tired. So relax. Make yourself at home and we'll be on our way. -Now what? -We lost the signal. The plane is underwater. We still have the map. Where did you put them? In my bag? Good. Hey, lovely ladies, bom dia. My name is Silva and I'm very enchanted to meet you. Please join us, Silva. This is Leilah from Seattle. -Hi, Leilah. -Yeah, you know... Space Needle, Nirvana... All that. Have you been to the States before? Yeah, for work. This is my first time here. I read about it. I've seen the fires and I want to help save the Amazon, the rainforest. That's great. Leilah. I'm born and raised here in Manaus and it's the first time I take such a boat trip for so many nights out on the river. I guess I'm more of a city boy taking this beautiful land for granted. Excuse me, I'm going to check on Flynn. Sure. Sorry to be so boldly, but I have to tell you how beautiful you are and how lucky I feel to be here with you. Never mind. You must have a very sad boyfriend back in Seattle. No. There was someone but he turned out to be a joke, so... What's your story? A hopeless and lonely bachelor. -Hello. -Hi. -I am Maggie. -Nice to meet you. -Leilah's mother. -Very nice to meet you. I should be going. Hey, boss, this seems like a nice boat. Nice people out there too. I'm glad you like it. Listen, as long as we get where we need to be, we're gonna be fine. Just keep an eye on them. You're a really good dancer. Oh, that's very sweet of you. Are you getting excited about boat excursion tonight? If that's happening. I don't think I'll able to make it tonight, I have some writing to do. But maybe next time. Don't forget that life isn't always about work. To leave some time for the fun things, too. I'll keep that in mind. -How about a dance? -Oh, I'd love to. Thank you. -Join us. -Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. The engine's burning hot. We're gonna need more oil. We're basically a floating kayak. Please everyone, enjoy this delicious dinner. It's our famous Amazon peacock bass. And tomorrow we'll be going on boats to explore the real Amazon. But first, tonight we have some stories for you. People have many stories and legends about our rivers and forests. Some celebrate the beauty and life giving spirit. While others warn us of the creatures we must respect and fear. And the one most special to me, is the forest protector. Takes the form of a very old woman. We never go into the forest at night for fear we might see her or hear her singing. And if you're lucky, you'll catch a glimpse of our beautiful blue and pink dolphins. The males can transform themselves into very handsome men wearing the finest clothes and a hat covering their blowholes. They rise up out of the rivers and creep into the huts of the young women. They seduce them, leaving their seed inside. We say that's the accounts for the sudden pregnancies especially when none of the men claim to be the father. Mr. Machado. Why didn't you go with the others tonight on the rowboat? What is that annoying sound? Ah, howler monkeys? That's a territorial call. That's so horrible. They can be heard up to three miles away. Strange to hear them at night, though. They must feel threatened. I-- I don't like animals. Why are you on the Amazon, then? That's one of the highlights of this trip. Good night, Mr. Romero. You know what he really wants. Who? Are you kidding me? Do you think I can't see what's going on? -He's not like that. -All men are like that. Please don't project your mistakes on me. We're not talking about me. You know ever since we got here... No, ever since I lost my baby, you've been overpaid-- Your miscarriage, when that happened, -I told you-- -Please tell me not. Oh, all right. Just want you to be careful. I'm 25. Not your baby girl anymore. I need to be who I am. Not who you want me to be. I don't know what that means. Jamal may have been my first but he's definitely not my last. Okay, Jamal, he knocked you off, he left you. I mean he was not even man enough to marry you. You know understand? Why do I even bother to try and explain-- -I am your friend-- -But you're not. So just stop suffocating me. Stop thinking about how to get in the girl's pants. Come on. It's not what I'm thinking about, Machado. Oh, yes, it is. This isn't the damn Love Boat, okay? We're here for a purpose and a purpose only. You're just doing great. Can't sleep? Nightmares, yeah. No, you've not really told me - why you get those. - It's not important. Please. I'd like to know if something happened in there. It's like you've locked something away from me. Like you're running from something. Everyone's running from something, Jack. Flynn, please tell me. Please. About 20 years ago I killed my best friend. Not intentionally, but it doesn't matter. We were in my car, had a few too many drinks that night. Got behind the wheel, my choice. Took a turn too fast. We rolled and I was thrown... clear, bruises. But he was crushed. I told them he drove. My friend took the fall for me. I didn't know you're going through that. I'm sorry. Good morning, everyone. We'll be out 15 minutes till breakfast ends. In about another hour we'll be mustered in the boats for an all day and night excursion to Barcelos village. Please make sure to pack your bug spray, sunscreen. We've got plenty of water. Sometimes you'll see the cayman right along that water line, just hanging out. -Can I help you? -How is the Queen? Still having trouble with the injectors? How do you know about the Queen? I named her. No. -I know this is a shock. -No, no. Who is this? Ask him. -I'm her father. -Her father? From the little I've heard, I didn't think I'd ever meet you. What do you want? I need passage on the queen. I can offer US dollars. It's not about that. I'll have to ask her. Jackie. We've got another paying customer. Absolutely not. -I came here in good faith. -You have no good faith. I wanted to see you before I go away. Okay. You've been away... for almost 20 years now. And you see me, so you can go away again. Go. I don't want to see you. Go! Jackie, please. Just give me another chance. Sorry, man. Watch your head. We have many stories and legends, about our rivers and forests. Some celebrate the beauty and life giving spirits. And others warn us of the creatures we must respect and fear. But my favorite is a story of the forest protector. Who takes the form of a very old woman. We never go into the forest at night. As we're afraid we might see this old woman or hear her singing. If she sees you destroying something in the forest, she will come for you. And you will never be seen again. Haunting cries come from this old woman. The spirit that protects the great jungle from those who want to harm her. You know, 100 years ago, the wealthiest slave owner built this beautiful mansion, along with a rubber plantation. And indentured servants or slaves really would walk miles every day, collecting just a few drippings of sap and they made just a few pennies each day. Horrible conditions. Leilah! Leilah. Where are you? You are funny. -You liked that? -Mm-hmm. Do you remember this place. How can I forget? It wasn't long after we met, you had this bright idea to go camping in the jungle. I just wanted a romantic night with you. But you got to admit the candles, the picnic, the blankets in the middle of the floor to make a bed... that was the night you fell in love with me. And being eaten alive by mosquitoes? Oh definitely did. But, seriously. That was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. We should be heading back. I love this country. So beautiful, so romantic. My heart is full here. It's so wild. So beautiful. Let's better enjoy it now before it's all gone. All they want, the people, it's coming here, take its treasures and go away. It sounds like you want to do something good for your country. I hope I can do something four my life. Oh, you'll find some meaning for your life, some purpose. It's rough. - Leilah! - We better go. -No. -We'll have other times. Coming! Let's pack our bags and leave. You could take us for a trip around your country. -Oh, crazy. -I'm serious. -I can't, Leilah, I can't. -Why not? Because... let's... just let's go. Thank you. Thank you. All right guys, let's circle up on over here. Welcome to the Tucano village. Before the Ayahuasca ceremony the villagers would like to perform their traditional dance. Here in this place our shaman will guide us through a ceremony of sacred transformation using ayahuasca. He is indigenous to this area. Ooh, I'm not so sure about this. Don't worry. These people have been using ayahuasca for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Oh, wait. Yeah, I saw this in a documentary, I think. For some people ayahuasca can be actually useful, right? Yes. Often they use it to go back to their lives and revisit past mistakes with a new understanding and perspective. Don't underestimate the power of the jungle. To these people, the rivers, the trees, the animals, the forest is very sacred. I don't know about this. Go ahead, mom. See how this high compares? It's probably better for your liver than booze. How do you know such thing? I know about your drinking problem. Thank you. Now you can go to bed early. Kitchen close in 30 minutes. Flynn to the wheelhouse. Flynn. Enjoyed your little acid trip? -I'm all messed up, man. -Yeah, I can see that. The damn boat is going too slow. It was the only choice, Machado. I know we're going slower than you expect, but we're getting there, man. And I'm kind of enjoying the ride. Well, stop enjoying the ride and stay focused. We have a plan. Stick to it. - All right, all right. - Jesus. Where have you been? Sorry, dear, we're dead in the water. I thought you bought enough oil. The generator works, but the engine is just dead. We... I believe it's the pistons. -How much is it going to cost? -Francisco's passage. Flynn, there has to be another option. Jackie, I know what he means to you, but this is the only way. Fine. Paulo, let's get the boat ready. Injectors. Oh is the injectors. I thought you might need these. Paulo, could you give me a hand? Yes. Are we good on my passage? -Yeah, we're set. -Okay. So, blackmailed you onto the boat, huh? Why don't we call it a truth? How'd you get those injectors so fast anyway? All night boat to Manaus. So, you haven't slept? Not for 20 years. I apologize for all the pain I caused you. So why did you to do it? Why did you abandon me? I was a child when you left. I am dying of cancer. Doc is giving me three months. I want honesty between us. I didn't leave. Your mother drove me away. She hated this life. It wore her down. She took it out on me. She went with another man. You're a liar. I can't handle this right now. Please just go. What's the delay? We had to replace some parts. Your advertisement said that this boat will get to Porto Braga I in five days. Now it's gonna take six or seven. Well, maybe you should have flown. Or maybe you should get this boat moving and make up for the lost time... Nobody can make up for lost time, Mr. Machado. You of all people should realize that. Me of all people? Miss Jackie-- If you want me to get going, please, Mr. Machado, move out of my way. He left me when I was seven years old. I didn't know. My mom had to raise me on our own and run the ship. That woman worked herself to the bone and sacrificed everything for me. When she died, I blamed him. I'll never forgive him for what he did. And for what he didn't do. Okay. It's all right. We can't, Flynn. Jackie, I'm sorry. -I never cheated on you-- -Please, Flynn. We've talked about this. I needed more from you. I gave you so many opportunities and I just... can't do anymore. I think we're just better off as business partners. Beautiful moon, isn't it? Oh, yes it is. And the river... it's so peaceful. That's because it has no fear or doubt. But sure, it gets to where it's going and it doesn't want to go anywhere else. So, what brings you on this little trip, Mister... Francisco? I was visiting an old friend in the village. I'm Jackie's father. Jackie's father? Oh, so you're married? Great. Widowed? Oh, we're so nice on the-- What are you doing in my purse? $400 is all? You have no right to go through my stuff. I do if you've been lying to me. You're broke. Because of this? You think that... you think the money is on my personal checking account? Oh, honey. No. There are stocks and there are a lot of bonds and some annuities... And I have assets. Really? Look at me. When your father died, there was... there was enormous burden that just descended on my shoulders, because he left us very little. What burden? You had money. I know you did. I gave a lot of it to charity. You drowned your sorrows in alcohol and went on one booze cruise after another, searching for middle aged men to leech off of. -That's where your money went. -Just stop. I took a few trips. So? I was hoping to meet somebody. That's one of the reasons why I'm on this boat. I'm hoping to meet a man. But I mean, oh God, Machado. No, he's creepy. Francisco. He's nice. But he's old and he looks broke. But oh, hey, Romero. He's cute. I like him, he's nice. Wait, don't go. You have to listen to me. All right? Look, look at me. Silva, he only wants one thing. -You know what... -One thing. Well, look at you. What? What? Did he use you and then throw you out? -Just like Jamal did? -No. I chose to leave. I'm my own person. You act like that, and you are no daughter of mine. Good night. Oh, wow. Hey, come on in. Have a seat. It's Leilah, right? You okay? -Yeah, kind of. -Can't sleep? With jungle noises and... Howler monkeys. ...and other things and argument. Hmm. You love this place. The river, the forest. I do. So do I. I want to move here and help save it. I mean it. Are you and Jackie... are you together? Uh, we were, but... that's not going to happen again. We are in a committed relationship business wise. We need to make this successful. For the more important things? I messed that up years ago? Did you love her? I did. I do. How do you know when you really truly love someone? When that person is your other half, all you think about. Someone, honestly that you'd do anything for. Anything? Anything. I want that. You okay? Something's not right. I don't trust Machado and Silva. Look, they might have stolen a couple of million dollars from a company in Manaus. I'm not sure, but back in Barcelos I caught a glimpse of a news report. I saw a police sketch with someone who looks a lot like Machado. I'm not sure. But I got to call my editor. There's no reception on board. Okay, let's calm down. Let's think this through. If they were thieves, why are they on a cruise? I can't figure it out. I got to call my office, call the police. Is there a satellite phone on board? Well, for emergencies, there still should be one on the bridge. But wait, wait, take it easy. This could be your malaria pills talking. How about we have some breakfast, okay? You'll feel better. Come on. I need to take care of this now. Flynn, I need to make an urgent call to Manaus. Is there a satellite phone on board that I can use? We do have one in the locker number nine. But please, make it quick. Santos, it's me. What did you find out? Okay, any names? Machado. Are you sure about this? Listen, this is what I want you-- I'll take that. Any of the monkeys in the fucking jungles were not enough for you, huh? You had to be the nosy one. I'm a journalist. What you'd expect? What you find out? You stole a lot of money from the wrong people. Your face is all over the place, Machado. -Everyone is looking for you. -Bullshit. Excuse me. Mm, there's nothing like Brazilian coffee in the morning. First time in Brazil? Yes, actually. How about you? Oh, I've been here for quite a lot. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to inform you that your vacation is officially over. And from now on you'll be taking orders for me. This is my ship! What the hell do you think you're doing? Shut up and sit down. Sit down. Listen, Machado. You ought to be ashamed of-- Mom. Like I was saying before I was interrupted. I am in charge here. Now put your cell phone in the bucket. With all your lovely, charming Let's go. You too, Missy. Let's go. Where's Romero? Romero, I saw him on the way. He went for an early swim. He'll be gone for a while. -Silva. -Yeah, Machado. Get the machetes and throw them overboard. Now, everybody on the upper deck. Let's go. Let's go! Silva. All good? Y'all sit down. You two, come with me. Let's go. Just do what he says, Paulo. Is that the only radio on board.? Yes. Get out. Let's go. You think you're tough with that gun, don't you? Why are you doing this? -Leilah, sit down? -No, I want to know. You, norte-americanos, have no idea how it is to survive here. Come, enjoy your vacation. Take whatever you want and then go home. Now, sit down, please. What do you want? Just go on a little trip. You guys cooperate, and I don't make your life hell. That is simple. You were a fighter, right? Could be. Don't be one today. Paulo, get back here! Move. Let's go. Go that way, you go sit down. Listen up. It's very simple. Do what I say or bodies will go over the side. You got that, old man? Hey, chefe, did you meant what you said? What? About body over the side, killing... we didn't talk about that. I will do what I have to. Okay? Now listen to me. I need you to go downstairs to the boats and pull the fuel lines and hide them in the closet. I don't want anybody to leave the ship. Okay? Certo. Where are they taking us? I don't know. But they don't want us. Romero was right. He was trying to warn me. He knew too much, so they killed him. They're using this boat to get somewhere. They can't reach any other way. Okay, but where? There has to be something that we could do. They're not gonna hurt us are they? Stay calm. Do as they say. If they get what they want maybe they'll just go their way. Don't count on it. He's right. We are pawns in their game. You need to get to Silva. You know him. You know how to get to him. Has Silva told you anything? No. I just know that he cares about me. -He's dirty. He's filthy. -Maggie. He did vile things to you, honey. He used you. So, you're going to use him. Do you understand me? You're going to do whatever it takes to find out what his plans are for us. Hey, enough. You talk too much. I need to go to the bathroom. Everybody will have a chance to go to the bathroom, okay? I hope you rot in hell. I don't feel good. I need something, because-- Silva, go to the kitchen to make some sandwiches. -Why are you doing this? -Jackie. Well, Captain America has his woman fighting for him again. Jackie, please. I would listen to him. You murdered Romero, didn't you? Hey. What are you doing on this boat anyway? Don't you know this is a man's job? I would learn how to control your woman if I were you. Now y'all be quiet. Come with me. You too. Flynn, go in. You step back. Let's go. In 1500 meter go to that tributary right there. Where are we going? To the money. Romero told me he saw a news report about a robbery in Manaus the day before we sailed. More than a coincidence. You think you're smart, old man, right? How do you think I got to be this age? My guess is you're trying to fly the money out-- Enough. Down! If you do something, I kill him. Now take us where we need to go. Then, I'll cross the border to Colombia. We'll disappear from your lives forever. Okay? Keep going. What's going on? Machado is using us to get his lost cash somewhere in the jungle. He's not gonna stop until he gets what he wants, is he? He's dangerous. Minha filha, I want you to have this. She was a beautiful woman. I never stopped loving her, or you. Why now? Machado is a loose cannon. We don't know what he's gonna do. Look, look. Who are they? Fishermen. Get rid of them. Don't say anything stupid. No, sorry. TenemosCOVID. Many are sick. Machado! Machado! Estupido!I told you to keep an eye on him. You, get away... Let's go. Down here. Keep an eye on them. That was fun. He wouldn't have lasted anyway. -You're proud of yourself? -You are a monster. Expect the same treatment if you cross me. I am a reasonable man. Silva, don't do this. This is not who you are. This is me. This isme. Look at me. I'm a criminal. You wouldn't use that gun to kill anyone. How do you know? I might. I could. Just leave me alone. Sit down. You, everybody else. Just sit back and cooperate. Okay? Silva, listen. You're not like him. He's a killer. Not you. Work with us. This can all end now. Stop it! Do not cross him. Once we found the plane, everybody go back with your life. -What plane? -Just what I thought. You try to fly the cash out of Manaus. Something happened. Now you need us. -We're you only way in. -Come on, Silva. Machado is gonna keep killing people if you don't work with us. Please, please. I can't go against him. Now move back. Stop the boat. Drop the anchor. Off the boat. Get a machete. Don't try anything. Go. Just like I thought. The plane is underwater. There are tracks here. Let's go that way. Let's go! Go. What is there? Stay there. Son of a bitch. Grab the case. Put the machete down. You know, Silva's gonna turn on you when we get back. What's going to keep him from taking the case? Shut up. Silva doesn't have the guts. What about the company? You know they're gonna keep looking for you. Listen, Machado, please... You give me $50,000, we'll take care of Silva. I'll get you to Leticia. I know Leticia. -Get your Jeep-- -Shut up! I am from Leticia, you asshole. Keep walking. You take me to Leticia. Stop right there. Give that back. I'm sorry, brother. Lo siento. You'll be okay. Don't worry about it. Come on, let's go. Push the boat. Silva's gone. Tell us what happened. The pilot drowned. And there was another dead body in the jungle. And a briefcase, silver. It had cash. At least a million dollars. Is there any chance that you can overpower them? -Don't be foolish. -No, but if he did, then what? -What happens to that money? -We can split it up. It belongs to someone else. They'll come looking for us. And if they don't, the police will. I'm too old to go to prison. Well, I thought that we split everything up and I'll help save the rainforest and do something good with my share. Leilah, it's not ours to split up. All right, look, there's just five of us. I mean, that's $400,000 each. We could just split it up and be done with it. And we'd be five more dead bodies. -Machado will not hesitate. -Exactly. Capita√£o, come with me. We're going to Colombia. Go! That's a nice boat you have. Alright, everybody upstairs to the upper deck. Now, now, now, now. Come on. Come on, old man. I don't have all day. Walk a little faster, old man! Come on. ‚ô™ Good morning, heartache Let's dance. ‚ô™ You old gloomy sight ‚ô™ Good morning, heartache ‚ô™ I thought we said goodbye last night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I've turned and tossed Until it seemed you had gone ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But here you are with the dawn ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Wish I'd forget you But you're here to stay ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It seems I've met you When my love went away ‚ô™ Thank you.

Why are we slowing down? I don't know. Something's wrong with the engine. Go fix it. Come on, lady. Hey you, come here. Okay. -What? -What's going on? We're working on it. I'm not sure. It's the engine. You think I'm stupid? Show me where we are on this map. You're gonna take me to Leticia Colombia with one of the small boats. It's not going to take more than a day. Get ready. Silva. Hey, listen to me. I need you to be strong now. Okay? After I leave, I want you to kill everyone -and throw them... -I don't want-- ...hey, hey! And throw them in the river. I can't kill Leilah. I-- I don't give a. Don't kill Leilah. Look... This is for you. Then... Hey, you meet me in Colombia and we split the rest. How do I know you keep your side of agreement? Come on, man. You know you can trust me. Hey, you're doing great. Let's go. You, missy, come with me. Let's go. Jackie! Stop, stop! No! Jackie! Jackie! No. Get off of me! Stop at once. What the hell you're doing, Machado? No. Mind your business, man. Don't! Back up! Back up! You get ready. We're leaving soon. Come on. -Give her, water. -Here, Jackie, have some water. Jackie, are you all right? -Jack? -What's going on? He wants me to take him to Colombia by boat. God dammit, I'm going to kill him. He will never make it there. That's stupid, Flynn. He's gonna see it in your eyes. He will kill us all if he has a chance. He's crazy. We have no choice. Please... just make it back to me. Okay? I should be the one going. No, Francisco, that's ridiculous. He's ruthless, but he's no match for this jungle. I know these waters. This is my element. No. Francisco, no, that's not safe for you. -I'll get rid of them. -No, no. Jackie, I don't have much time left. The time I have is for you. You take care of my daughter and the rest of the passengers. Please, Jackie. Let me do this. No, you can't go. Please, no. What's with the chit chat? I know a shortcut. I know these tributaries. It won't give you any trouble. Silva. Coming, chefe. Keep these lovely people company. Okay. But if you put any tricks, I'll kill you on the spot and then I'll come back here and put a bullet in your daughter's head. -Understood? -Understood. Let's get going. Let's do that. Silva, get the case. I am doing great. We have enough supplies to last us. Okay, let's go. Hey, watch for that bag. Okay? Come on, come on. Let's go. Hey, you're doing great. Three more tributaries to Leticia. About two more hours. The cash on the plane, is that dough Real Cattle Company? Their bulldozers run 24 seven. If they don't run, they burn, they're destroying the rainforest. To hell with all of you. So what happens when we get to Colombia? And your friend, Silva? That's a clever plan. Except for the fact that you're going to shoot me in the back when we get there. It's over, Silva. Machado is not coming back. Can't you see? He's gone. Your money's gone. It's done. It's done. -It's done with it. -You guys don't understand? I'm begging you, Silva. -Let it go. -I'd never use it. The bullets... I threw the bullets in the river. What did do you do with the long boats? It's in the cabin. The parts is in my cabin. - I'm going after Machado. - All right. -I'm sorry. -Silva. I'm sorry. I didn't mean. I didn't want to hurt anybody. I know you'd never hurt anybody. I'm going too. On the other side of this forest, you'll be on the outskirts of Leticia. We'll be there in a couple of hours. A couple of hours? I thought you said it was the shortcut. Let's go. We don't have the luxury of the boat anymore. Let's go, Flynn. Dammit. Hey! Hey! Hey! You're dead, old man. I'll kill you. Don't call me an old man. I'm not going to kill you, you bastard. I'll let the jungle do that to you. No. Dad. I love you so much. No, we got to go. Come on, come on, please. We got to go and take the Queen. -Come on. -I'm not gonna make it. We got to go. We got to go, please, please. You know I love you. I've always loved you. Jackie. No matter how hard we tried we just couldn't get the engine to work. My dad really did a number on it. Bless him. It was his plan all along to get Machado away from us. His way to try to save us. With food and fuel almost gone and no chance of a boat passing by, we decided to make a run for the closest town, Leticia. If we can make it there we can buy the parts to get the Queen up and running again. Silva offered to help us out with some of the money that he just happened to have with him. For the survival of the group, I had to leave the boat for now. But I would never truly abandon the Queen. And the case with the stolen money, we tried to find it, but it just disappeared. Gone. The Jungle always wins.
