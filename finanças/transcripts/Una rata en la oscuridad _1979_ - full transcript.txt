A Rat in the Darkness This property for sale Information here! Sonia? I never get tired of poking around, the bathtub is sensational, we'll have to do a raffle to see who the lucky person who keeps it will be You know, in spite of the age of the building I think we've gotten a deal Looking at that portrait again? Why does it interest you so much? - Lovely woman, don't you think? - Very attractive Who could she be? Maybe the old owner? She doesn't look like a housewife dressed like that You're right. What do you say we play a guessing game? Father always said I had certain clairivoyant gifts Do you remember when he lost his watch and I told him where to find it? Yes, that was very strange, but it was even more so when you foretold mother's crash Well alright, making use of my extrasensory faculties, I think that... this used to be a house of prostitution - and she was the one who oversaw it - Oh Sonia, don't be silly Yes, that's why they sold it so cheaply, because of it's bad reputation, understand? What's more, I think a crime was commited here. She had a lover and when he learned she was unfaithful, he killed her Oh Sonia, please And in this salon they held large dances with little clothes and lots of perversion Enough daydreaming, why would it have to be that? Well if you don't like that, then it's... an enchanted mansion, that's it - Full of ghosts - Naturally, and her spirit is in every corner By the way, that woman reminds me of someone Stop imagining things What we have to do is give all of this a good cleaning We'll leave this as shiny as a mirror. I think we've made a good acquisition, - our father would have approved - I'm sure of that Be careful, according to what they say all the cupboards are full of dehydrated ghosts, but don't worry, to do away with them - we could change immediately - Impossible, have you seen the electric wiring? It's terrible - We could have it fixed - And with what money? I don't get paid until the end of the month I'm about to sell a painting. Oh, it'd be divine to light our way by candlelight Wouldn't you like to feel like you live in the past for a moment? Oh yes, all the time. Have you ever considered how uncomfortable that would be? But it would only be for a few days, and besides, did you forget we have to leave the apartment immediately or we'll have to pay for another month of rent? Yes, you're right. Alright, you win, but the first one that gets money has to promise to go to the electric company and take care of the wiring and the contract Alright I see I enjoy my comfort more than you do, and I'm less romantic at that - Now I remember - Remember what? Do you know who she looks like? Like the real estate agent who sold us the house Oh, that's true, except that she had short blonde hair How do you feel? - Like I was hit by a train - Yes, that was hard work Will you come down for some coffee? I'm a corpse, I can't walk, my whole body hurts Let's see, come here, I'll give you a massage. Hand me the ashtray You'll feel better That's wonderful, your hands are so soft Well, now you're the owner of a house Me? And in the near future when I finish paying for it I'll sign it over to you That's not fair, you spent all of your savings on it You know everything I own is yours That's how it's always been When we were orphaned you took on the role of a mother, I really never felt her absence. You gave me everything a mother could give, caring, understanding, love Tell me something Josefina, is it because of me that you haven't married? Nonsense, I haven't gotten married because I haven't wanted to, I've had enough suitors But you've always driven them away when you saw things were getting serious Well, that would be because none of them were my knight... ...in shining armor Now let's talk about you, you strange creature You don't like having a social life or being around boys your age and that worries me I would like for you to have a family, to better yourself - You want to drive me from your side? - No, you know very well it's not that, but time goes by, one isn't always young, and solitude is very sad One day I won't be here and the idea of leaving you alone terrifies me You don't have to worry about that, I'll be gone before you Don't say that Sonia! Forgive me, I didn't mean to alarm you, I spoke without thinking Let's let time go by, let's not think of anything that's not in the present Happiness is in always being together, I only ask you never stop loving me You know that will never happen What's the matter? Sonia, what's the matter? A hand, a hand touched my cheek What did you say? Are you sure? I guess not Is it possible we've really bought a house full of ghosts? You've finally come out to sunbathe Something worries you sister, I know you. What is it? - It'd hard to talk about it - Say it With all sincerity Josefina, don't you feel anything strange in this house? So it's that, you're still thinking about that hand that touched you And you still don't believe me, right? I think you had a hallcucination brought on by the effect of the candles I don't know what to think, there's something strange in the air, in the walls, something damnably strange in this house I think that if I give some literature classes at the institute they'll pay me next Monday, if that's the case I promise to take care of the electricity immediately And do you think you'll solve everything with that? Do you want to play a hand of cards? No, not today, I'm very sleepy. Coming? - Everything seems so familiar - Familiar? Yes, I mean I have the feeling we've been here before Good morning. Why didn't you wake me up, you know I never sleep in this late I thought you were tired, what does it matter? Did you notice the house shook last night? Did it really shake? Do you want coffee? Thank you. There's no sugar. - What were you doing? - Nothing What are you looking at? The painting? Sonia, I'm talking to you Did you sleep well? - Why do you ask? - Does that seem like a strange question? - Excuse me - Why are you acting so mysteriously? I'm not being mysterious, you're just imagining things Tomorrow I'll find out where you hide so I can lay a trap for you Sonia? - Are you coming down for dinner? - No Sonia? Sonia! Leave me alone, you know I've been- You've been what? Are you going to paint? - Get out of here - You can make your own breakfast Sonia, have you gone crazy? What in heaven's name is going on? Get out of here, I told you to get out of here! Sonia, I feel sick. Sonia, I'm sick Sonia! Leave me alone, get out of here or I'll kill you! I'm going to kill you Snap out of it! You've gone crazy! I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you! Help! Sir, for the love of god, call an ambulance, my sister hit her head! Call an ambulance please! Wait, wait! - Relax, relax - Who are you? Dr. Salas, an intern at the Santa Fe Hospital. Relax And my sister? She's in an ambulance headed to the hospital to take care of her wound It's really nothing serious. What happened to her? - I hit her. I want to go with her - Very well, if that's your wish, but you have a severe case of nervous exhaustion It doesn't matter, I want to be by her side You see? You're very weak, the best thing to do is rest I'll give you a sedative and tomorrow you can go see your sister Very well Doctor, perhaps you're right Nothing in this house will hurt me! I'm going to find out what you did to my sister, you wretch! Imposter! Imposter! I'm leaving, and now you won't be able to stop me What was that? Yes Doctor. Yes, right away - Good afternoon - Good afternoon - Ms. Sonia Hill's room - Allow me The patient was released an hour ago - No, I think you're mistaken - No, it's written here on the list - Do you feel ill Miss? - No Sonia, answer! Do you like the house daughter? - I like it, I like it a lot mother - Me too, I think your father would have enjoyed living in it You know, I'm a widow, now it's just my daughter and I and for our needs this house is perfect The conditions are favorable, we'll close the deal tomorrow Daughter? Daughter? Good afternoon Translation: turdis May 2010
