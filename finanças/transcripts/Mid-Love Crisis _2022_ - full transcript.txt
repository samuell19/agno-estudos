This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. [Mindy] The two greatest days of our lives... are the day we're born and the day we discover why. As a child, birthdays were my favorite day of the year. A celebration of all the love in my life. A celebration of me, and of the person I was, and the person I was becoming. Birthdays were a reminder of my "why." But now birthdays are just a reminder that... I'm old! And in 10 days I'm gonna be 50... 50. That is a number that forces you to reckon with the finality of life. Did I tell you I'm already getting junk mail for life insurance and reading glasses? People have started calling me ma'am. I heard a song that I loved as a teenager and then I realized it was background music for an arthritis commercial. I'm just losing my mind over my birthday. I mean, what... what is your therapistic diagnosis here? You want my raw, unfiltered opinion? Yeah. Okay. Yes, 50 is big. It's a transition, a rite of passage, and it's perfectly normal for this to trigger a kind of midlife crisis. I'm having a midlife crisis? Sorry, did you not realize this? Okay. How do we fix it? Fix it? Well, you don't fix it. You... you feel it. I'm gonna give you the same advice I give my actual patients. I tell the kids that when these big emotions come up, feel them. It doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing, just stop. Put your head in your hands and feel your feelings. It kinda sounds like having a nervous breakdown in public. I'm... even if it's not, it's still a little protracted and hard-won, and I'm looking for an immediate Band-Aid type fix. What have you got in that category? What do you think would fix this? Day drinking. [waiter] Your usual. Oh, obviously we come here too often. Mmm. Cheers to that. So, is everything set for Rita's visit? Mmm... yes. And she's bringing Emily which is great. Then, of course, in classic Rita style, she texted me last night and asked if it was alright if Emily brought her uncle. Which, of course, I want to meet him. I mean, he's basically been Emily's father since her parents passed. Things must be getting serious. Oh, they're 23 years old. How serious could they be? Remind me how old you were when you met Marc? You know, Rita might be trying to "Parent Trap" you. No. Really? She makes some questionable decisions but she knows better than to set me up. Honey, you are 50 and fabulous. Is it really so bad to be set up? I'm just not dating. You've been divorced for two years. I've been widowed for one and I'm already on dating apps. And I am so happy that's working for you but I just... I don't want to digitally date. And besides, even if I met someone tomorrow and fell in love, I would be... 70 before I could trust that he wasn't gonna leave me. Wow. You really do need a therapist. Mm. It's so true. Did you wanna come over tonight? Rita would love to see you. Ooh, I can't tonight. I'm heading into the city. I promised a visit with the grand-babies. Send photos. Oh, you know I will. Listen, feel those feelings. Okay. You got this. You're amazing. - Oh... - Yes, you are. [car engine struggling] Or not. Hi. Uh, it's Mindy Quinn. I am parked up the street from the bakery and, uh, my car's dead. I was wondering if you could send someone to jump me. I mean, someone to jump my car, of course. Great. Thank you. [sighs] Feel your feelings. Feel your feelings. Feel your feelings. Feel my feelings. Okay. I feel stressed. Feel my feelings. Hey, are you okay? Uh... I'm fine. Mortified, but fine. Well, even though you're so obviously fine, do you mind if I join you? I, uh... I happen to be an expert in emotional breakdowns in public. I'm not having a breakdown, I'm... I'm just feeling my feelings. I... I was told it's a... it's a thing to do. Yeah, I see that. Sorry. Do you wanna talk about it? You're a total stranger. Well, sometimes talking to a stranger makes it easier. Well, um, if I was going to be totally reductive, I would say that, um, I may be having a tiny... little, very manageable, uh, midlife crisis. Sammy? Oh! Sammy Berman? Err... yeah, it's just Sam now, but wow, that's Mindy Modine. - Uh, Mindy Quinn now, but yeah. - Oh. Mindy Quinn. Uh... wait, are you just visiting Deer Lake? No. I... I live here. Uh, going on three years. Yeah, I inherited my parents' house on Myrtle Drive. 507 Myrtle Drive. [gasps] Wow! You remember that? How is that possible? Keep the old noggin fit, you know. [laughs] Apparently. Wow. Uh, so... and what are you doing? Are, are you visiting? Yeah, just for the weekend. - Oh. - Yeah. That's wonderful. I mean, you'll have fun. Yeah, it should be a lot of fun. [laughs] Yeah, last time I was here it was with you. It was, what, like, 32 years ago? Yeah. So, you were saying you're, you're having a midlife crisis? [laughs hysterically] Oh! No, no, no! I was joking! [continue to laugh] Yeah. Oh, gosh. I mean, but, um, you know, if you wanted to, you know, catch up, have coffee, we could, we could exchange numbers. [phone ringing] I don't think that's necessary. Oh, hang on, I gotta take this. Hey, hey, hi. Um, yeah, I'm here. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Okay. Love you, love you. Um... do you need a lift anywhere? Oh, no. I mean, err... my car's dead, but they're coming. Really? Do you want me to look at it? I'm... - No. - I know my way around vehicles. The mechanic will be here any minute, I don't wanna bother you. Okay. I hope you feel better. I'll see you soon. Oh, I hope not. [peaceful music] Rita? Honey? Oh gosh. Mmm! Mom! - Hi, honey! Oh! - Hi. That was supposed to be for dessert. Well, I got hungry, I'm sorry. You're late. I know. It was a whole thing. My car wouldn't start. I needed a new battery. And then... - This was unbelievable. - Hmm? I ran into my high school boyfriend. What? No way. That is cray-cray. It was cray-cray. I mean, it was astonishing. This guy was really my first love. I thought Dad was your first love. So, content marketing? I'm glad you're working. Mom. What? I can, like, actively feel your disapproval. No. No disapproval. I am happy for you. No, you're not. You're just worried that I'll regret dropping out of med school. Nope. Not worried anymore. Unless you do regret it. No. We've been through this. There's no regrets, Mom. And, um, Emily and her uncle will be here any minute and I just... I want us to have the perfect weekend because I have some exciting news. [car honking] That's Emily. - Hey! - Hi! Hi! Hi Emily. Hi! Hi. I hope the drive wasn't too bad. It's so good to see you. Thanks for hosting my uncle. Oh, sure. I'm... I'm looking forward to... You're Emily's uncle? That's incredible. I didn't really realize myself until I saw you earlier today but I hope this is okay. Uh... That's why you didn't want my number. I thought you were just rejecting me again. Mom, wait. What? [Sam] So, the year was 1989 and the place was your mom's homecoming dance. [Emily] So, you two went to high school together? No, no. We, we didn't... I went to a different high school, one I actually attended. [Rita] Oh. Uh, uncle Sam was, uh, a bit of a rebel. - Oh, okay. - [Emily] Yeah. So, you fell for the bad boy? Was he, like, a greaser who drove a hot rod or... [laughing] No, because we didn't go to school in the '50's. But way to age us up. Anyway, my sister, uh, Emily's mom, set me up on a blind date with someone who went to Mindy's school. I showed up and I guess she'd stood me up. But it turned out to be very lucky for me 'cause that's how I met your mom. She was twirling around on the dance floor. So beautiful. Oh, stop. Almost as beautiful as she is right now. Stop. [laughs] And she had real moves. Mmm. My mom is an amazing dancer, that is, when you can get her to dance. What?! You don't dance anymore? That's... that's a travesty. The dancing queen. That's all we ever used to do. Well, it's almost all we ever used to do. Stop. [laughs] [Sam laughs] Mindy... Mindy used to... Mindy used to sneak out of her window at night and I would pick her up and we would go out at night and just cut a rug. What happened after that? Uh... who can remember, right? Anyway, ancient history. Who wants dessert? I got pie. Uh, actually someone ate all the pie, almost all the pie. [Mindy] Thanks for doing that. [Sam] Oh, my pleasure. After all, I'm a guest here again. After all these years. Although the place looks different. We renovated it a few, um... I renovated a few years ago. We? The former Mr. Quinn and I. [Mindy chuckles] I mean, he's still Mr. Quinn, but we're divorced now. Oh. Yeah. You knew that already. Yeah, we've been, uh... we were married 23 years, been divorced two, almost three now. Hmm. If you, uh, don't mind me asking, what happened? Oh, uh, Mr. Quinn woke up one day and realized he'd be happier with someone else. - Sorry. - Mm. But enough about Mr. Quinn. What about Doctor Quinn, medicine woman, right? - No, no. - What? Actually, uh... no. I'm not. That was your dream to be a doctor. That... you were pre-med when I left. And I did get into med school, um... and I got pregnant so I didn't finish. Dr. Quinn is my husband. Uh, ex-husband, still a doctor. I ended up teaching high school science for 20 years. But I really loved it. I mean, I love it. [laughs] I love watching my kids get excited about science. [Rita] Oh, good. I was hoping that I'd find the two of you alone. I might've not been entirely honest about why I invited you. So, I know that we all wanna get to know each other and partially that's because I hope that we'll be a family soon... because I'm gonna ask Emily to marry me. - What? - Wow! Wow! What's wrong? You, you love Emily. I do. I do love Emily. Um... and I would love her to be my daughter-in-law in the distant future when... when you both are older. [Emily] Rita, can you give me a hand? I'll be right back. Agh! Oh, my gosh. Are you feeling your feelings? No. No. This is a breakdown. Full on. [peaceful music] [laughing] Oh. You still take two creams? Thank you. You're up early. Oh... not really. 'Cause that would mean I would've slept, which instead I was up all night, uh, ruminating on my and Rita's life choices and consequences and I thought you and I should talk and, um... get on the same page here. I just wanna discuss the proposal. I don't know how well you know Rita but she's incredible. She's... oh passionate and vivacious and just runs head first into life. Sort of... sort of my secret self. Huh. But she also makes rash decisions. Like last year she just suddenly dropped out of med school. Yeah. Emily did the same. She was taking a master's in writing and now she's working on a crisis hotline hoping to be a therapist. They're young. They're still finding themselves. - That's right. - Yeah. And I support that. Marriage is not a place to find yourself. I mean, marriage is a lifetime commitment. Or it's supposed to be. And, I mean, Emily and... and Rita, they're so good together but it's only been a year. There's no rush. We can agree on that, right? We can encourage them of that, right? Yeah. I'll think about it. You really support this? Yeah. I don't know how I feel but... I can't say yes to you if I don't mean it? You can't? Really? I do it all the time. Wow. It's beautiful. It's nice to be here. It hasn't really changed very much. I remember, that's the ice cream store that we used to go to every day. - Yeah. - [Nathalie] Mindy! Hi. Hi. Look at you. Oh! So, this must be Emily. Hi. - It's very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And Sammy... - Hi. Sammy Berman all grown up and here in Deer Lake. Remember the uncle I was telling you about? Um... - You're kidding? - No. Wow, okay. This is a lot to unpack. Great to see you, Nathalie. You look great. You too. Didn't we used to go on double dates all the time with what's his name? Chuck. Oh yeah, that's a long story. We are on our way to breakfast. Why don't you join us? Yes. Yes, I will, gladly. Wait. Wait, Mindy. So, if... if you dated Sam, so you must've known my mom. I did. I did meet Jan a few times. - She was about 15, 16 then. - Yeah. She was so lovely. I'm really sorry for both of your loss. It's a crazy small world, isn't it? Thank you. You know what's actually amazing? - What? - What is? It's like, you two having dated. Like you knowing my mom, it just... it feels special. Like fate... kinda. Well, that's because we're meant to be, babe. Ooh! Oh. - I love you. - I love you. [Rita and Emily giggling] [waiter] Anything else? [Rita] A slice of red velvet, please. [Mindy] And a cappuccino for me, thank you. You're having cake for breakfast? Life's short, have dessert first. Oh, life is also long so make good decisions to lead to a successful future. That's no fun. Also, this red velvet is the best. Mom, please tell me you're getting red velvet cake for your birthday. Oh, when's your birthday? Nine days. I mean, yeah. I keep the old noggin fit, remember? I remember, right? Thank you. This isn't just any birthday. My mom is turning 50. So we have to start celebrating your quinquagenarian rager right now. Wait... quin what? Uh, no. Um, no. No rager. And no planning because I am just having a simple gathering of a few friends over to the house for lunch in the garden and nothing birthday related. What? She sent the email. No gifts, no cake. No cake? How are we supposed to sing you happy birthday? Well, you're not because it's terrible. Everybody singing and staring at you and you don't know what to do. Wait, what? I don't wanna bust you here, but I remember you being 18 and having three birthday cakes and about 100 people. That was then. I mean, I was young and carefree and... I mean, now I'm just... old and I worry about everything. Mom, people just wanna celebrate you. Come on, it'll be fun. They wanna celebrate aging and, and it, and it's depressing and doesn't warrant celebration. And so it's not happening. End of discussion. Absolutely not. Stress vacuuming? What? Stress vacuuming? It's calming! The louder the vacuum the greater the escape! Right. [exhales] Come here. [out of breath] So, um, I wanted to talk to you about the proposal. I was hoping you'd maybe, possibly wanna pass your engagement ring onto me? Grandma's ring. Um, don't you think that would have kinda bad juju with the divorce and all? No, not at all. It's a family heirloom and, you know, despite getting divorced, you and Dad still had a lot of years of love and... Your disapproval is palpable. No. I do not disapprove. I love Emily. And I know you love Emily. I also know that you have the rest of your life to compromise. To take care of someone else before yourself. To take care of others and... and to make big, irreversible choices. You think I rush into everything. I just know that you're only 23. So? You were, like, 23 when you met Dad and you guys got married straight away. Well, I don't think that's the most successful example. I know you don't feel it but you are so young. And I know you think you know who you are and what you want but those things are gonna change. [sighs] Listen, I will support you, whatever you decide to do. But please, I encourage you to give this some more thought. Okay. Okay. I feel like I'm always interrupting your meditation. Interruption is, uh, an important part of it. [Mindy] Huh. [Sam] It teaches you to always be present. [Mindy] Oh. - [Sam] So... - [Mindy] That's nice. [Sam] Yeah. [both laugh] [Mindy] Sure is peaceful out here, isn't it? Did you ever get to that ashram in India? - I did. - Wow. I went there for a few years. And then I hitch-hiked to Nepal and I climbed the mountains. [both chuckle] Then I came back to the States and I just worked construction and volunteered in meditation studios. I just kinda floated around for a while. Until... until Janet, um... Yeah. Um... I can't imagine how hard that was. Losing your family. Suddenly becoming a parent. Ugh. - Yeah, to a beautiful teenager. - Hm. - Sometimes complicated. - Hm. But, you know, that's... working construction, going to the ashram, all those things are things that taught me about life. What did you learn? Uh... I learned that all people who wander are not lost. But some of them are. And I learned that although life is beautiful it is impermanent. So was, um, marriage and children too permanent for you? Before Emily, yeah maybe. So, I mean, maybe you can understand how it might be too permanent for Rita and Emily right now. Or, yeah, maybe the fact that life isn't permanent means you should love who you love when you can. Is that why you're out here, 'cause you're trying to convince me to dissuade Emily and Rita? No. No. I just... I... I wanted to chat. I... I mean, and yes, I do wanna tell you that I... I mean, I did encourage Rita to, to give it some more thought. Wait, so you planted seeds of doubt? I remember you doing that with us. I did not plant seeds of doubt with them or us. I told Rita she doesn't have to rush in. This is her first love. So what's so terrible about spending your life with your first love? They're young. They're too young to know what they want. They're too young to know, or are you too old to remember. I mean, honestly Mindy, this has nothing to do with Rita and Emily. It has to do with your baggage from your divorce. Wow! [laughs incredulously] My baggage? Oh right. Sorry, I overstepped. I'm sorry. No, no. This isn't about my baggage. Okay. Look, I overstepped, I'm sorry. No, no, no. No, it's fine. It's fine. 'Cause you know, I should go to bed. Because I'm... I'm so old. No, I didn't say you're so old. I said you... I said you were too old. Oh, you know, that's... that's not much better. Hey. How dare he, too old. Because I'm too old. Because I am too old, aren't I? No. Honey, you are just spiraling here. Mindy sit. You know, the thing is... I think Emily and Rita are great together. In fact, I actually think Emily might be Rita's person. If that concept even exists. And as a parent all you ever want is, for your children to be happy and loved. Of course. So why am I so terrified? What's your advice? The same as it was before. Feel your feelings before they erupt. Now I'm just picturing my head blowing open like a volcano. You got anything else? You are a very good therapist. Yes, I am. I'm still not your therapist so find someone. Just leave all those juicy Sam tidbits for me, okay? There's no Sam tidbits. Juicy or otherwise. Just your nine-inch red velvet. Thanks. I hope you're not ordering anything for my birthday. No. [laughs] Actually, I'm ordering it for the proposal. So, you're doing that, okay. I'm happy for you. I'm scared for you too. Why? Because I just don't want you making different versions of my same mistakes. I don't want you to sideline yourself for someone else and then wake up 20 years from now and not know who you are. - Here you go. - Thank you. Did you get an inscription on the cake? Yes. ♪ Forever. Oh. Hashtag let's hope so. [both laugh] - [Sam] Hi. - [Mindy] Hi. I was wondering, um, if you would join me for a picnic. I don't know if I can carry all my baggage. I might be too old. Well, maturity-wise, definitely not. [laughs] I do know the perfect place for a picnic. That's a yes! [cheerful music] Remember this place? Yeah. Wow. Wow. Wait... did we? Mm hmm. Was it...? - Oh... - Wait. Oh yeah, here it is. We were so young, weren't we? This is where I got my first real kiss. Real kiss? I mean, first one that ever mattered. [chuckles] Don't get all sappy on me. Come on. What's for lunch? Well, in keeping for the nostalgia theme for the day... we are having a Mindy Modine special. Cheese sandwiches and snack cakes? [laughs] Seventeen-year-old Mindy's favorite. That's... [laughs] So, saturated fat is your way of apologizing? Somewhat, yeah. Well, I am sorry that I made it more intense when you had your mid... your "feeling your feelings." But I'm also interested in, you know, why it was so intense. [sighs] The proposal, I guess, um... and my birthday. My job might be in jeopardy. Um, we're having layoffs at the school. I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. And, I guess... I also just feel... lost. Like, I'm not a mother the way I used to be. I'm not a wife. I may not be a teacher anymore. It's just not what I'd planned for. It just not the future that I thought would... You know, on the best of days I think about getting older as like an awakening. We are awakening to, uh, the person that we've always wanted to become. Have you awoken to that person? Well, I'm a month younger than you so I still have time. [laughs] It doesn't... it doesn't have to happen yet. Okay. Alright. How are you so chill? What is your secret? I'd say that my secret is... I don't mind what happens. Hmm. I shouldn't. But I'm going to. [laughs] Oh... oh, my God. That is... that is just pre-packaged manna from heaven. [laughs] It is just so delicious! [laughing] What? You're as wonderful as I remember and also somehow more wonderful. [Mindy] Anyways, I like my rocks. That one's my favorite. Hey. Um, is it okay if I talk to my mom for a second? - Oh yeah. Yeah. - Cool. What's going on? Um, well, I was chatting with Dad about the proposal and... he just seemed really left out. So, I was wondering if maybe he could join. Of course, honey. It's whatever you want. Really? It's fine? Yeah. If you want him here then it's fine. Okay. You're... you're really sure that's cool? Cool. Yes, it's cool. Okay. Cool, I'm gonna call him now. [sigh] [peaceful music] What are you doing? Oh, just a little late night kitchen drawer reorganizing. I do it a lot. With a flashlight? Uh, I was trying not to wake anyone. I guess I woke you? No, no, no. I just needed to get some water. Does this late night drawer reorganizing have anything to do with the fact that your ex-husband is coming tomorrow? Uh, partially. And partially his girlfriend, Eileen whom I'm sure he'll be bringing. Oh no. Is she, uh... 30 and teaches Pilates? Worse. She's my age. And brilliant, gorgeous, successful. She actually has a TED Talk and not one of the annoying ones. [laughs] So that's why you're up late alphabetizing your spices? Garlic, cinnamon, parsley. Oh, see? That's not right. You know, it's also about what we were talking about at the picnic. I was just lying in bed wondering who am I? And what do I want and how did I become this person? What person? Oh, this person. A person who... who has a plastic bag filled with used and washed plastic bags. Why do I need a corn kerneler, a pickle picker, a taco chopper. An electric wine opener. No, that one... that one I need. But this? Why do I have an air fryer? I mean, when did I stop frying my food in oil? It is one of life's greatest pleasures. It's never too late. [sighs] You're right. It's never too late. I could make French fries right now. Yeah, you could. [both laugh] Let's do it. [laughing] Oh... Wow! - Oh. Wow. - Isn't it? - That is so good. Mmm. - Mmm. [laughing] See? Never too late. Never too late. [I music] Mom, I know you think I'm rash or rushing into things or whatever, but I think you should consider reframing it. Finding the positive. - Okay. - Mm hmm. Rita, I'm so glad that you're rash and rush into things. No. I mean, I just wish that you could see how I seize the moment and how I'm inspired by passion and how I have faith that things will work out so I don't need to worry. I do see that. Rita. Nice to see you again. Oh, hey Andy. So Mindy, I don't know if you heard but Debbie made her decision. I'm being let go. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I expected it. After all, I was the newest hire. Oh still, it's terrible. How are you doing? I don't know. It's hard. We have a new mortgage and twin babies. It's really stressful, actually. [sighs] You know what? No. No to what? No to you losing your job because I am gonna resign. - What? - What? Yeah. [laughs] You can't! No, I can. I can. And it's the right thing to do, for you but... but also for me. You're the best. The kids love you. They need you. Oh, they have you. They'll be fine. I... I don't have the words. Thank you so much. I'm gonna go call my wife right now. Thank you! Um... Mom, did you just randomly quit your job right now? Are you, like, freaking out? I think I am, like, freaking out. But, you know what? It feels right. I've been teaching for 20 years and it's time for a change. Hey. Whatcha doing? Uh, just researching master's for rooms. Oh. To become a therapist? Yeah. I mean, I thought about, um, going the doctor route, becoming a psychologist, but what I really wanna be doing is therapy and, um, a two-year Master's can get me there. Well, that sounds great. Yeah. It was actually Rita who encouraged me. Mm. And I... I wanted to show you. Um... It was my mom's. You know, for like... hopefully someday. Wow. It's beautiful. Huh. Thank you, Mindy. For what? Just for making me feel like family. Oh, of course, Emily. Of course. [tender music] So, when I got back from India I bought a camper van. And I just kinda criss-crossed the country. I worked odd jobs, uh, I went to all the national parks and hiked them. Just kinda found myself, you know? - Isn't that amazing? - It is amazing. We should have adventures like that. We could quit our job and buy a camper van and go to Burning Man. Nobody needs to be going to Burning Man. Wait, what's wrong with Burning Man? Uh... a bunch of unshowered hippies dehydrating themselves in the name of art. [all laugh] Don't get me started. So Sam, when you were re-enacting on the road did you keep in touch with my mom? No, he definitely did not. No, we didn't end on the best of terms. Why? What happened? Well, since you asked, your uncle dumped me. I didn't dump you. What would you call it? I'd call it... I couldn't be who you wanted me to be. [notification alert] [Rita] Wait. Dad's here. Listen, I admire your adventurous life but could you just take it down a notch 'cause Rita is very impressionable. I mean, Burning Man, really? But also, and not to dredge up the past, but for the sake of historical accuracy, you did dump me. Some would even say it created a core wound of rejection that forever shaped my relationships and sense of self. Some would say that? My therapist. My friend who's a therapist, same thing. Mindy, I didn't dump you. You dumped me. Okay, that is rewriting history. No, it's not. It's really not. I couldn't be what you wanted me to be. You had these big expectations for your life. You wanted to be a doctor, you wanted to marry a doctor. So, we both knew what was gonna happen. I hurt you. What? No, I'm fine. Really. I told you my secret. I don't really mind what happens. We should head in. Sweetie. I missed you. - Hi. - It's good to see you. Hi Mindy. Marc. Uh, oh... flowers. Oh. - Oh, thank you. - For my ladies. Thank you. Carnations, your favorite. Um... where is Eileen? Oh... uh, Eileen and I, we broke up months ago. I thought you knew that. [playful music] - Hi. Uh, Marc. - Oh, hey. Quinn. I'm Sam Berman. I'm Emily's uncle. Oh. Dad, get this, Mom and Sam dated in high school. Wow! How about that? Yeah, Sam was my first love. Awesome. Well Rita, you should tell your dad about Burning Man. About who? Eileen is not here. They broke up. [Nathalie] And? And this is the first time I'm seeing Marc single since our divorce. And? And it's weird. And Sam's here and that's weird. And I am navigating two men who used to be the love of my life. And now are strangers. Okay. Well, let's think of them like strangers. That means you get to re-meet them in a different role, in a different capacity, on different terms. I don't know what that means and/or if I can do it. Well, how long is Marc staying? Uh, just through the proposal tomorrow. Okay. I think you're gonna have to rely on your inner resources for now. Oh, the house is already spotless. No, Mindy... - [knocking] - Oh, god. [Marc] Mindy? I gotta go. Okay. Good luck. Hi. Stress cleaning? No. I don't do that anymore. Really? Actually, I was looking for a toothbrush for you because I remembered that you always forget yours. - Oh, well... thanks. - Uh-huh. By the way, uh, Rita wants to take everybody to the lake chalet. Oktoberfest is on this weekend. Fantastic. [chuckles] [festive music] [crowd cheering] ♪ So, uh, you were Mindy's first love, hey? Yeah, so she says. That's nice. And fun. [laughs] Although it's strange that she never mentioned you. Well, she probably didn't wanna make you jealous. [laughs] Oh, okay. Uh, you mind? Nope. Oh. [chuckles] Thank you. So, uncle Sam, what do you do? I work in construction, build homes, design furniture. Oh, nice. You know, I actually just hired a new construction firm to add an addition to my medical practice. I'm in family medicine. [laughs] You wanna go again? Oh. - I think our table's ready. - Oh. Sam, you gotta try these potato pancakes. [Sam] Mmm. [Mindy] Thank you. Oh no, thank you. I don't eat fried food. But I got an air fryer and wow, you really can't tell the difference. Huh. So, sweetheart, have you given any more thought to returning to medical school? Oh wow, Dad. I'm surprised you waited this long to bring it up. Well, no, I'm just asking. You know, I'd really love to pass the practice onto you. Yeah. Let's, um... talk about something else. Okay. So, Mindy, how's school going? Pretty well. Actually, this is going to be my last year teaching. [coughs] Whoa, whoa, whoa. You quit your job? But you're so close to retirement age. No. Actually, I'm not. Um, but yes. I resigned. So, come the end of this year I will be fun-employed. [laughs] But what are you going to do? I don't know. Um, find something new. I haven't figured it out yet. But wouldn't it have made sense to figure that out first? Probably. Who wants more beer? Excuse me. - Cheers! - Yeah! [laughs] Um, hi. Uh... excuse me. Mindy, Mindy. Are you okay? Because frankly I'm a little bit concerned. What? You quit your job? Are you having a midlife crisis? Wow, Marc, yes. And it is so uncharacteristically attentive of you to notice that I am having a midlife crisis. Thank you for asking. Whatever it is, I am worried. You're fun-employed and Rita's proposing. Which reminds me, are you encouraging this engagement? I do support it. How? She is 23 years old. They are 23 years old! What do they know about marriage, about what a marriage should be? Nothing, Marc. They know nothing about what a marriage should be. But they know something about being in love and they know that love shouldn't be anything and it can be whatever they make it. It can be about friendship or passion or self-growth. And together they can become the people they wanna be. They probably know more than you or I ever did. Can I get a beer?! [silence] Please. Thank you. Pay them. Give them a nice tip. Yeah. Uh... Um, so it's a catastrophe. So, the weather forecast for tomorrow calls for rain and if it rains then the hot air balloons don't fly and then that means no picnic and then no proposal. - Maybe it's a sign. - Dad. Honey, what do meteorologists know? They never get the weather right. [thunder crashing] But it's our anniversary. [exhales] Uh, the message says that they'll be open again tomorrow. Sweetie, there's always your two-year anniversary. Or your five year. Dad, Mom, look. I am proposing to Emily, okay? So you just need to get on board. What? What did I do? Nothing. I just... do something. - Do something. - [sighs] ♪ You are everything I need ♪ ♪ in this world ♪ you are everything I need ♪ ♪ You are everything I need ♪ ♪ in this world ♪ Dad, thank you so much. This was a great idea. See, the weathermen are never right. You know, this is bringing back so many memories of being fishing with your dad. You remember? What, wait. You came to Deer Lake with Mindy? Yeah. I spent one glorious summer here. We got into some trouble, didn't we? As kids do. We used to go dancing every night at the saloon on Main. Well, at least until my 10:00 PM curfew. You know that saloon's still there. There's still dancing. - What? - Mm hmm. What? We gotta go! Yeah! Hey, we could all go, right? [laughs] Hey Dad, did you also go out dancing with Mom? I did indeed. In fact, when we first got married, your mother used to dance all the time. I would dance alone 'cause you hate dancing. Hm. Mindy, show us your moves. Uh, no. Yeah, come on Mom, get jiggy with it. Oh boy, okay. I called this one the chips and dip because I'm getting chips and dip. [laughing] Hey, Mom, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Yeah. What's up? Um, well, I was just thinking about, you know, where to do the you-know-what. Um... Are you gonna do it here? No, no, no, no. 'Cause I was thinking we're all already here and you're throwing the big birthday rager. Oh, not throwing. Not big. Not rager. It's going to be beautiful of course, 'cause everything you do is beautiful and I just, you know- Rita, just tell me what you want. Okay. Well, um, I was thinking that your party would be the perfect place for me to, you know... So, you want everyone to stay. Yeah, it's just like five more days. Five days with Sam and Emily and your dad. Yeah, it's... I mean, it's only if you're okay with it. Of course I'm okay with it. Yeah? [laughs] [Rita] Thank you. [Mindy] Oh. We're gonna throw you the coolest party. Oh. [laughs] That's cool. So cool. Cool. Super cool. I'm bringing muffins back... [singing] Those other pastries don't know how to act. Take 'em to the fridge. [laughing] [laughing] Oh my! Okay. So, let me get this straight. You are bringing muffins back to both your ex-husband and ex-boyfriend who are staying with you at your home for the next four days. Five days, including the party. Which, yes, is my birthday party that I didn't wanna have that my ex-husband is now attending. Hmm. You could've said no. We both know that is not my forte. [laughs] [Marc] Hey, good morning. Coffee? Uh, please. Oh, I got it. After all, you are a guest. So, I heard you were staying for Mindy's birthday. Been wracking my mind for a gift. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. Fifty is a milestone and I spent half my life with her so I want to get her something special. But you shouldn't worry about getting her anything. After all, you two barely know each other. You know what? You just gave me a great idea for a gift for her. - I did? - Yeah, thank you. Um... [door opens and closes] Awesome. [Mindy] I've got muffins! Oh, uh, Mom, Dad, after breakfast can we go into town to prep for the party? I told you I didn't wanna do anything big and you got a habit of leaving your stuff all over the house. I know. But it's your 50th and it's the backdrop to the proposal. [sighs] Please, Mommy? Please? Please, please? Of course. And I promise I won't go overboard. Alright. And, um, Sam, can you keep Emily occupied after breakfast? Roger that. Muffins? Thank you. Everyone. What about a chrysanthemum wall backdrop for the photo booth? Photobooth? I don't wanna be photographed. Rita, you promised that you weren't gonna go overboard. Oh, and also, I have some exciting news. So, I found a super cool camper van and I'm thinking about trading in my car for it. Uh, honey, a camper van is not very practical. Uh, well it is if you're living in it. Like, if Emily and I decide to do a big, yearlong, cross-country trip. Or, um, go to Burning Man. Burning Man? Oh, I thought that the girls already told... Yeah, they wanna go to Burning Man. Honey, a big, yearlong cross-country trip, that sounds like a great plan for retirement. But for now you have a suitable car that your mother and I bought you to get you to and from work. No camper van. [notification alert] Oh, um, Emily's asking if I can join her for a hike. Oh. Well, sure. Do you wanna take my car? Thanks. Just don't trade it in for a camper van. Ugh. I can, um, I can call us a Lyft. Or we could walk. Uh... okay. Okay. [Marc] Oh Mindy, I'm sorry. [Mindy] It's in the past. [Marc] No, no, no, no. I mean, I'm sorry about all of it. Deer Lake. Dancing. All the ways that I let you down. And I'm especially sorry about how I ended our marriage. It's true, I was unhappy, but that wasn't your fault. Well, you sure made it feel like it was. I know, but it wasn't. Honestly, I think that I was having a midlife crisis myself. Woke up one day and all the good things in my life just didn't seem like it was enough. I wish you could've told me that. It wasn't your job to make me feel less lost. I don't know, maybe I was just looking for a change. Maybe we could've changed together. I realize that now. I know I hurt you and I know that we're exes but I wonder if someday we could be, I don't know, better exes? I don't know. I'll think about it. Um... I can't say yes if I don't mean it. I respect that. Oh boy. I know what's coming. [laughs] Come on. You know I don't do the bridge. It's safe. It's a shortcut. It saves five minutes. And I don't mind the long cut. It gives us more time together. We always took the long way around. I like the bridge. Okay. I'll see you on the other side. [hopeful music] - Oh... - I don't like Hey Mindy. - Hi. - Hi. Um, hey, are you free tonight? There's somewhere I'd like to take you. Um... yeah. Sounds great. See you later. [peaceful music] I can't believe you brought me dancing!

Just pretty much working on your surprise. I hate surprises. Plus, I said no presents. - [Rita] Absolutely no presents. - [chuckling] Mindy, can I get you a coffee? Uh, yes, thank you. Here you go. [Marc] So... I was up all night thinking and I wanted to talk to you. And I know you're thinking, still thinking about whether or not we could be better exes and I don't wanna push you. But what if we weren't exes at all? Excuse me? - You okay? - Mm hmm. Hey. Uh, Mom, when will you be ready to go? Go where? Uh, to go to our meeting with the DJ. The DJ for your party. You're gonna love him. He plays all the hits of the '80's and '90's like doo-wop and, uh, barbershop quartet or whatever. Very funny. Fine. Great. I'll go too. - What? - Yeah. Hey, uh, so Emily and I... we're gonna take off downtown. - [Sam] We'll see ya. - [Emily] Okay. Bye! - [Marc] See ya. - Bye. See ya later. I'll get dressed. Hurry up. [Rita] Oh, so I have some news. I'm moving forward on the camper van. No, no, no, no. We talked about this. Why would you do that? Uh, because Emily and I decided to have our adventure. Quitting our jobs, traveling the country, visiting national parks, eating barbecue. Okay well, you can hike and eat barbecue while living at home and working a job. This is what we wanna do. Yeah, but we don't always get to do what we wanna do. It's called growing up. You know, Sam did this exact thing and he said it was an amazing experience in finding himself. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sam said this, did he? This was Sam's idea. What, Sam said that, right? What's Sam's idea? Who do you think you are? Telling my daughter to quit her job? What? I didn't tell your daughter to quit her job, I just encouraged her to be who she is and learn to live- Like you did. So she can end up like you? A flailing seeker who what, what, coasts through life? Marc stop. No. It's true and you know it. You ever thought maybe you're not exactly the right person to be giving life advice, pal? Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'm not. But, uh... at least I know that about myself. I was just trying to encourage your daughter and my niece to learn who they are and who they wanna become. So that they don't wake up one day and realize, wow, I have no idea who I am. Excuse me. I'm gonna... - Sam. No Sam. Sam, wait. - No, it's okay. Wait. I'll see you back at the house. What? Girls, I'm sorry. [hopeful music] [Mindy] You feeling your feelings? [Sam] Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, Mindy. I'm fine. You know, it stings, right? But Marc's right. I mean, look at me. I shouldn't be giving anybody life advice. None of us have it all figured out. At least you've had a beautiful, different life. Different? Different? Special. And you're a wonderful man and an incredible uncle. If that's true then why have I spent so much time in my life feeling insignificant? And lost. Maybe because you're still grieving. Or maybe because you are lost. Because... we're all lost. You have to remember the stellar advice that you gave me. [laughs] What? It's never too late to become the person you wanna be. And how have you taken that advice? Way to deflect. But, um... I am still figuring it out. Um... I always believed that you're given one chance and if you don't take it, that's it. And maybe... maybe we are only given one chance but we can make more. And I have an idea. What? Something that we could do to feel young again. Wait. What, are we gonna eat more snack cakes? Better or maybe worse. It's yet to be decided. Wait, you're going swimming? Well, actually I was thinking, you know, just for nostalgia's sake... What, you wanna go skinny dipping? [both laugh] Okay. Now that I'm actually getting naked in front of you in broad daylight and everyone in that house, I'm just swimming! Ahh! [upbeat music] ♪ [peaceful music] - [Mindy] Oh my God. - [Sam] What? [Mindy] Oh, I just... I just realized I feel young. And I don't mean young again, I mean, young in a way that I couldn't feel before. What does it feel like? Like... possibility. [hopeful music] Let me guess. You wanna have a deep and meaningful chat about the camper van? Actually no. I support you. Really? You don't think that it's a mistake? No, no I don't. And even if it is, fine. Make mistakes. Make all the mistakes that I didn't have the courage to. Who are you and what have you done with my mom? Ah... No, really. Why the change of heart? [sighs] I guess that I have been able to see myself better lately. And so I can see you better. And I see how self-assured you are. How unafraid, passionate. How much you know yourself. But don't think that you and Emily have it all figured out because you don't. But maybe you can figure out some of it together so... My ring, grandma's ring. May it bring you so much love. [laughs] Thank you, Mom. Oh. And if I'm any of the things that you said, you know it's because of you. Hey. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? No, it's fine. Mindy, I was hoping that you and I could have a chat. - Uh... - I'll go find Emily. Um, I actually have to, uh, head into town. Um, could I meet you at the bakery at 1:00? How about the bridge instead? The bridge it is. Marc thinks we shouldn't be exes. Does that mean he wants to get back together? I... What should I do? No, no Mindy, there's no "should" here. The real question is what do you want to do? I don't know. When Marc told me he wanted a divorce, I prayed that he would change his mind. Take me back so I wouldn't be alone. But now, do I really want that life back? Am I okay being alone? 'Cause I feel like I'm okay. But... if I've changed and Marc's changed, maybe we could work together. Maybe I should give Marc another chance. 'Cause after all, I mean, we did have a beautiful life together, didn't we? And... to have someone again. Someone who's known me my entire adult life. I mean, I'm never gonna find that swiping right. Well, you'd have to be on a dating app to swipe right. It's true. And I'm not. [laughs] No. No, you're not. - You gonna cross this time? - No! No! No! No! [laughs] That's not funny! It's a little funny. [laughs] I was going to make a grand romantic gesture but now it's not gonna happen. Oh... I just... I wanted a moment. I wanted a moment alone. So I could give you your present. Wow. Marc... I thought they were appropriate. I think maybe you and I are like a pearl. We need time and pressure to find our final perfect form. But if we stop the process too early... we're only sand. Sorry, if that's cheesy. You're beautiful. And you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Why? Because of Sam? No. I don't know. Maybe, partially. I'm just trying to figure out who I am and what I want out of life. I just, I don't... I just don't know if, if... if I'm this person anymore. I mean, maybe I never was. Thank you. I want you to have it. Marc, don't go. I mean, let's talk it through. Marc! Ah! Hey. Hey, hey. What happened? Did something happen with Marc? Yeah, uh... He gave me a gift and then we kissed and... and it just wasn't anything but he stormed off and now he's upset. Okay. Where are you going? I think it's time for me to go. Why? I think I've overstayed my welcome here. You know, your plan. I'm not part of it. What do you think is going on here? I don't know. You tell me, Mindy. I mean, I thought something really nice was happening between us. But I get it, it's family, but I'm not gonna be a part of some weird triangle. Okay, well that's not happening. And it's a complicated situation. Doesn't seem that complicated to me. Seems like history repeating itself. I am still not good enough for you. That's not true. Listen, I'm good enough to go dancing with, I'm good enough to have fun with but I'm not good enough to spend a life with. Okay, that's ridiculous and if you feel inadequate, that's coming from you. It's not coming from me. You know, you talked about a core wound of rejection. Try spending 32 years of your life knowing you're not good enough for the person you love, or loved. Whatever, it doesn't matter. I'm just... I'm sorry. I got caught up in the whole fate thing or whatever. This is how it's supposed to be. Okay. What happened to the "I don't mind what happens?" Because it seems like you do mind. So, is this what you're gonna do? You're just gonna, you're just gonna leave? You're just gonna run, hide, quit? You don't know if you're good enough and you're too afraid to find out? Just... happy birthday, Mindy. [engine starts] [sighs] [Rita] Oh, hey Mom. I had an exciting idea, about- You know, what would be an exciting idea? Is if I didn't have to pick up after you all the time. Oh, okay. Well, I was thinking I know that you wanna cater your party but what about a sushi station? No. No sushi station. [Rita] Okay. What about fondue? No fondue. And, uh, no DJ. And no photo booth, whatever the size. And... and no cross-country camper van and no barbecue and no quitting your jobs and definitely no Burning Man! And no... no "not exes" and no second chances! And most of all, no party! That's the most important thing because I am not having a birthday party because I'm not having a birthday and you're not getting engaged! We were... we were getting engaged? [crying] Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm sorry. I'm just... sorry. Hi. There you are. Hey. I'm sorry that my family is bonkers. Now you know where I get it. And I'm sorry if everybody was right and I was just rushing into a proposal. I don't think you were rushing. You don't? Of course not. 'Cause when you know you know. And you know? I've always known. I guess, what I'm trying to say is... Rita Quinn, will you marry me? Yes. [laughs] - But only if you'll marry me. - [Emily laughs] - I love you. - I love you too. - Hey. - Hey. - Thanks for meeting me. - You bet. I wanted to say that I was sorry. Mindy, you were long overdue for a public outburst. You have nothing to apologize for. No, I do. I do. All this time... I let us believe that you were to blame for leaving our marriage because you were not happy. And the truth is... I wasn't happy either. And as heartbreaking of a decision as our divorce was, it was the right one. And I want to be more than better exes. I hope we can be friends. Me too. [sighs] And, uh... um... No. I know you're gonna find the right person for these. And she's gonna love them and you. Just the way you deserve. Thank you. [hopeful music] Oh, Marc. Move over Joan Crawford, Mommy Dearest is here and I brought breakfast. And I am so sorry that I ruined your proposal. And I do still want the two of you to get engaged. Hashtag sorry. [Emily and Rita giggle] Um... What? Oh! Congratulations! Oh! Oh, now I have two daughters. Mom, I am sorry for bulldozing your birthday party and also for, like, occasionally maybe being selfish or whatever. I'll grow up. I know. Don't rush it. But I will cancel your party. No, actually I wanna have it. Really? Yeah. I think... I think we should celebrate. Yeah, we should. We should. And we are having cake for breakfast. Oh. Because we have a party to throw. Serving up apology. Dig in. [Mindy] Emily. Emily... Um... can I get your uncle's number? [phone ringing] [voicemail] Hello, you've reached Sam. Leave a message. [beep] Hi Sam, it's Mindy. I've always believed that the two greatest days of our lives are the day that we're born and the day we discover why. As a child, birthdays were always my favorite day of the year. A celebration of all the love in our life, a celebration of me, a celebration of the person I was and the person I'm becoming. And birthdays were a reminder of my why. Why am I here? Who am I? Who can I be? What is my life for? And you reminded me of my why. What I'm trying to say is I am throwing myself a birthday party tonight and I was hoping that you would come by and help me celebrate becoming a quinquagenarian. Okay. Bye.

Where we'll be working and... and studying remotely. Oh, that's a really good compromise, girls. And to be totally honest, I've always been curious about Burning Man.
