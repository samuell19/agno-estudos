[ Trumpet playing ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Trumpet continues ] Sportscaster #1: Top of the ninth, two balls, two strikes, astros leading the giants 5-3. We have runners on first and third. Silvio baretto on the mound trying to turn the lights out on San Francisco. Sportscaster #2: And, man, nobody has left the dome tonight, I tell you. Dodgers have already lost. If the 'stros can win this one, we're only five out. Ooh-whee! Sportscaster #1: Baretto on the mound, looking in for the sign. Shakes off the first one. Takes the second sign. Checking the runner on first. The windup, the pitch. Outside, ball three. Oh, man, that was way outside, Bob. Listen, you gotta think, if he loses this guy, he's out of here. You'd have to think so, because Dave Smith... You can do it, sil, one more time! ...the bullpen for the last two innings. I'm surprised he's not in there already, 'cause you really want this ball game. Okay, back to the matter at hand. The astrodome crowd on its feet. Roberts leading off first, vasquez down the line at third. He could walk home and not make a difference. It's Roberts they have to concern themselves with. He is the tying run. Full count, the windup, pitch, strike three! Got him! Oh, yes! The astros are in, baretto gets the win. This place is nuts. What do you think? Well, astros keep getting... TV interviewer: Very exciting game, and we do have sil baretto here. Sil, can I ask you a couple of questions real quick? Just real quick, sil. First of all, how's that arm feel after nine very hard innings? Sil baretto: A little tired in the ninth, but I'm glad I could finish. You seem to have, uh... Pretty good velocity tonight. That last pitch, was it really and truly where you wanted it-- uh-uh-uh-uh. On September 14, 1988, at approximately 10:32 p. M... Mike seaver proposed marriage to one roxy Bennett. Ah-ahh! Huh! Oh, Jesus. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Mike: And she said... Uh-huh. [ Romantic music playing ] Night, miss Selma. Night, sugar. Now, you be good, you hear? Yeah, always. Oh. -[ Weapon cocks ] -[ Gasps ] [ Pants ] What are you doing here? [ Weapon cocks ] What's that? Oh, god! No, no, please don't hurt me. Pl-please, please. -[ Swoosh and thud ] -No!!! [ Gurgling ] [ Phone rings ] Seaver. Hey, what's happening? Oh. Oh, no, not another one. [ Sighs ] Where? Yeah. What time? [ Blows raspberry ] Son of a bitch! I'm the third badge in the force and you're calling me at 7:00 A.M. What're you calling me so late for? All right, all right. Is Ronnie there? Yeah. Okay. Don't--don't touch anything. Yeah, just sit down and smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Oh. I'm sorry. You be careful, Mike. Where are my keys? Over here on the table. What would I do without you? That's what I wanna know. Hey. Still want to marry me? Goddamn it, Kyle, this ain't the county. That's that. Ronnie, this is a county beach. This is a county parking lot. All right, Kyle, it's county. Does that make you happy, cowboy? Well, your pet dog is out of his cage again. Ronnie: Don't start that shit either. The man is a burnout. That bonehead play he pulled up in Dallas, that's burnout, Ron. What the hell is this? Don't start on me already, huh. Who found her? Right over here. Did you move her? Any witnesses? Did you ask to see if there're any witnesses? No, sir. I--i didn't-- didn't think... What's your name? Bibbee, sir. First time? Yes, sir. -[ Sighs ] -Okay. Stick around. Dale: I didn't let anybody touch anything. Aren't you the big brave scout? Why the fuck didn't you call me? Mike, what the hell are you-- don't Mike me. First time, you call me. Me first, you got it? Comprende? And who moved this body? This is a mess. There're certain people you can't keep out of here. Now, do you comprende? [ People chattering ] Dale. Get this right out. Yeah. Hey, big d, what's going on, big d? You talking to me? Oh! Don't shoot me, hoss. Hey, I'm innocent. I didn't do nothing wrong. Don't shoot me! Goddamn it, Kyle, I warned you, boy. Let him run his big dumb mouth. I suppose those are your lovely boot prints all around the body. I reckon that's all you've uncovered so far with your hot shit big-time procedures. The m.O.'S the same. Where did you get that big fancy yacht of yours, broussard? Shut up, both of you. What the hell's the matter with you two? I feel like Arthur mccanny on the Friday night fights. Just a minute, Ronnie. I believe I got a right to see evidence. I know the rules, Kyle. The heat is gonna come down on all of US. When the governor starts kicking ass, it's gonna be yours, it's gonna be yours, and it's gonna be mine, and I don't like having my ass kicked. Now, is that clear? The newspapers are already starting with this "murder capital of Texas" crap. You will both share in any information. You hear that, big d.? And like that song says, "I cover the waterfront." Don't let me catch you snooping around my boat. We just set our badges down, and we'll get it on, you and me, hoss. Back off, both of you, back off. The press is right there. Oh, you wanna pose for some pre-fight photos? Hey. Come on, let's have some photographs. Come on, get 'em up. That's all right, Ronnie. I'm gonna leave that to celebrities like him and like you. I'm gonna get me a cup of hot mud. Yeah, well, put some ice in it and cool off. Hey, get them back. Get 'em back over there! Seaver: Twins crew 40-footer. Where does a guy who works in the sheriff's office get money like that, huh? [ Sighs ] Michael? You got anything relevant to add to this homicide? Yeah, Loretta akers. She wasn't robbed. And look at this. What, another note? -"Best of luck." -Oh. It was inside her panties. [ Sighs ] Give it to Oscar mendoza, tell him to get it down to evidence to lock up. And tell him to keep his bungling hands off it! Same handwriting as the others. And that first one, that first note said what? "My very best." Aghh. "My very best." "Best of luck." Not showing as much imagination. Well, at least we know two things. He's got a taste for blondes, and he's got nice handwriting. [ Squeaking ] Sh. [ Door opens ] Good morning. Hold it! Police. Who are you? Eva lyons. You and Loretta in the same industry? Hey, this is a murder investigation, sweetheart. Don't pull that silent shit on me. When I heard on the radio "a blonde," I mean, I couldn't believe it was her. I... -Came up to see. -Uh-huh. I told her, "Loretta, you don't have to work down there." I mean, those damn beaches, a bunch of crazy people. I mean, we were doing okay up here. [ Sighs ] I don't know. Last couple of months she just, uh, acted crazy, like she didn't care. She got stuck on some guy. What guy? Earl Howard benard. Lying snake. Worked at NASA. Electrical stuff. Did this guy ever write any letters? You mean, like love letters? Yeah. No, darling. No one writes love letters anymore. I mean, why write when you can buy a card at the mini-mart that says the same phony shit? Where do you live? First floor. -You're under arrest. -What? I cooperated. You vice guys count that. I'm not vice, miss lyons. I don't make deals. Besides, I think you were sent up here to snoop around. I was not! I think you ought to keep your mouth shut. Come on, let's go. Come on. [ Garbled baseball announcer on the radio] ... he delivers...A shot! Deep to the hole just to the left to second base. Rafael Ramirez, long throw to Davis, he got him. Attaboy, Rafael, baby! Man: Number one. That's Denise dickson, the first victim. She was murdered on the fourth of July, wasn't she? Yeah. She was found behind St. Anthony's church in Houston, in a dumpster. Wounds are the same as the ones inflicted on Kimmy Martinez-- uh, two lacerations. One from the ear to the sternum, and the second, under the chin. That's no knife. What is that, a cleaver? What are we talking, a butcher here, some goddamn slimy fucking hyena? Excuse me, I'm sorry, bibbee. Go ahead, Dale, I'm sorry. That's Loretta akers. That's a tattoo on the right thigh. Can everybody see that? Men: No. All right. There. With the name of Earl. Seaver: Earl Howard benard from Pasadena, California. Now working for the jet propulsion laboratory. L.A. authorities are checking for US. Ronnie: Roll it. Dale. Dale. -Dale, go... -Yeah? Go back one, will you? What about a hook? You know, like a... Longshoreman's hook. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, "my very best" is written on corrosible bond. "Best of luck" is written on the corner of a mobil gas service station road map. This is the Denise dickson note. It's written on a napkin, coffee-shop variety. But Houston hasn't been able to get closer than that so far. Seaver: Is that it, Dale? Yes, sir. All right, that's all. -Dale? -Yes, sir? Wanna go in my office and bring me my goddamn excedrin and a cup of water, please? Sure thing, chief. I want a comparison done on those two handwritings with the one found on dickson in Houston. Okay. And I need some outside help on this, Mike. Says who? Says the newspapers and every TV commentator from here to dime box and back. Thank you. This damn butcher boy's just getting warmed up, Michael. So I'm gonna ask you, 'cause you've been in big bright lights. Should we get some expert help sent in before the body count runs up? Ronnie, what the hell are you talking about? I'm supposed to be the shaky one in this outfit, not you. We run our own shop, don't we? I think you can talk to me. What is it? Lamar witty. Lamar who? Lamar wi-- [ Laughs ] Come on, Mike. Don't make me laugh, goddamn. [ Grunts and laughs ] Lamar witty. Lamar witty? That's a nice name. -It ain't that damn funny. -[ Scoffs ] Lamar witty. Lamar retired out of the CIA about five years ago. Now he's on the governor's staff. He's sort of a... General ass-kicker and a very specific ass-kisser. Anyhow, that seems to be his calling. Lamar says the governor ordered him to offer his assistance in this investigation, in any manner deemed necessary. You see, the governor's buddy's real nice. It's very hard to lure money, move real estate, and lease units, have your boats charted in the middle of a goddamn recession if there's a killer running around. It's not our problem. I don't own any of that junk. Do you? Hmm. Only thing I own is this job. [ Door closes ] Uh, the chief asked me to say this. We just got a message from the governor's office asking US if we need any assistance-- their way of telling US that we don't know our ass from ice cream. I don't need any assistance from the governor's office. Any of you need assistance from the governor's office? All: Hell, no. That's right. All right, bodine, varney, shue. Want you all to hang with employment files on all waterfront hotels, motels, restaurants, bait shops, marinas, and especially check ol' shorty's out on west beach. You crosscheck names against our files. Assault, sexual, armed, anything. And, mendoza, I want you and bi-bbee... Where the hell is bibbee? [ Clears throat ] He got sick. He threw up on his shirt and went to change. And I want you to tell your wives and your girlfriends that daddy ain't gonna be 'round for a while. Eighteen hours on, starting now. And that leaves damn little time for drinking beer and no time at all for watching vanna white. Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Seaver: Well, you have it covered, chief. Okay if I take a piss, chief? It's all right with me, old hoss. Just remember you pissin' in galveston, not Dallas. [ Giggles ] I guess I have got a whole lot of getting ready to do. Wait a minute. Mike and I have decided we only want just the family. Oh, no, no. You are my only child. We're gonna do this thing right. Besides, what about rich and davie? And there's your daddy's side of the family. Quit rushin'. We just got engaged last night. Maybe the galvez has a room we could rent. Well, let's not talk about it now. [ Baseball announcer speaking on the radio ] Hi. Hi. I just told her, honey. You don't have to say a thing, Alma, -i know how pleased you are. -[ Laughs ] Little Mikey seaver. [ Giggling ] Shoot. Now, who would have thought, when you and me were doing the dirty bop at ball high school that you would grow up to be good enough to marry my baby? Jack Bennet'd turn over in his grave. Not a baby, mama. I suppose he would. What do you wanna do tonight? I feel like dancing. You got it. 7:30. Okay. Alma, wanna go for a spin? Quick thrill in your undies? It'll take a lot more than that. What a troublemaker! Hey, Mike. What about that girl? We're working on it. [ Up-tempo music playing ] [ Music ends ] Seaver: Remember freckles Bartholomew? Who? Freckles Bartholomew. Oh, yeah, freckles! How could I forget freckles? -You don't remember him. -[Laughs ] Anyway, when Phil Harris used to bring his band down here, and he needed a good sideman, that's the guy he'd call-- freckles Bartholomew. He was a pal of my old man's. [ Chuckles ] Your father knew a lot of people. Ooh. Did he ever. What a bunch. Pimps, shylocks, gamblers. They broke every blue law down here. You should have seen little Mikey running up and down the beach, selling chances on a punchboard. Yeah, those were the days. Aren't these better? Mmm. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah. What is it? I'm glad I didn't forget Jack Bennett's little girl. Eighteen years later, there you were, on the beach. You said, "excuse me, did you have a red bicycle with balloon tires?" What an obvious move! It wasn't an obvious move! It was the truth! You think I didn't remember you? Mm-mmm. [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] Good morning. Hey, hold, hold. Look at that. All you read in these damn newspapers is these murders. Everything else is pushed to the back page. Kyle's got the red ass about Eva lyons. Oh! He says you grabbed her out of our jurisdiction. You wanna go light with him. He's got a lot of friends. You know she's one of his stable. I know nothing of the kind. And I wish once in a while you'd walk in here with some goddamn proof instead of just a hard-on. Ooh! -Do you go to church? -Yes, I go to church. Do you pay attention to your pastor? Damn it. My private life's none of your fuckin' business. Come on, we got some new names to look at. George w. Ganper. George w. Ganper. Sounds like a damn labor leader. Ganfries? Sentenced to huntsville two months ago. Crayton penn. Did his boyfriend in with a champagne bottle. Crayton penn? Thought we had him in folsom. Yeah, how did his name get in the files? More efficiency, boys. I'm being paid by the millisecond. I want you to run some numbers down for me. That's gonna take a lot of-- shh! I know that. Take it. Ronnie: Vernon d. Sharp. Oh, yeah. He was the conroe creeper. [ Ronnie chuckles ] About eight gals cornered that son of a bitch in a shoppin' center and beat the living shit out of him with their high heels and their boots and their belts, purses and everything before we took him in. You remember that? Yeah, I remember that. He's also in Baton Rouge under arraignment. Hey, how about Alex lynch? No. He's not a keeper. Ronnie: What do you mean, "he's not a keeper"? Son of a bitch killed a woman with a razor. That's 20 years ago. His second wife, Celia. I can read, Michael. He-- he found her in bed with another guy. God, I don't believe this. Are you actually feeling sorry for this asshole? Michael, he is a deviate. He collects panties, and he hangs 'em on his clothesline. I'm telling you the guy is harmless. He's just a sniffer. All right. He was a muscle for my old man. Yeah. And that ain't all he was. You know he used to work down at the docks. Remember that? At the docks, as in bale hook? I'll check it out. Thank you. Donnie lamond. Oh yeah. I remember him. I wanna go against him again. We skipped him the first time. This is the boyfriend of Kimmy Martinez, the second victim. I hear some scuttlebutt he likes to kick the ladies around. Let's go. [ Phone rings ] Homicide. Gries. Hold on, hold on. Lamar witty out of Austin. Goddamn it. Ronnie: [ Whispering ] Shark! Hello, you channel cat, how the hell is your hammer hanging? Straight down. [ Laughs ] How you doing, Jack rabbit? How am I doing? [ Chuckling ] Hell, i'm as good as a pig in thin shit. Shirl! Yeah. Ronnie, the governor wants some action on these killings. Hey, Lamar, now, don't you be afraid, we're gonna take care of--shirl! We're gonna take care of everything. And I ain't gonna let you guys just take over this damn investigation without US first having a fair crack at it. I gotta go to Washington for a couple of days. I'll run it by him when I get back. All right. You do that, Lamar. And you make it real clear now. I just got off the phone with Ronnie Nelson-- shirl. You could bring the aspirin and the water at the same time. Oh. Sorry. Hi, Donnie. Remember me? I can only talk a couple of minutes. -The boss-- -that's fine. We just want a couple of minutes. What happened to Kimmy? Gave you too much lip, eh? -No. -No? She filed a complaint against you when you were up for speech therapy in Saint Jacques. Oh, yeah. That was only one time. She got me pissed off. Uh-huh. Split lip, broken eardrum, 14 stitches in the back of her head. She must have really pissed you off. I-- I already talked to you people. The night Kimmy was killed, I was in freeport. Stopped me on a driving violation. It's on the traffic ticket. Ah-ah. You don't wanna be rude, Donnie. You were arrested pretty early, Donnie. Give you time to get back here to galveston and take care of Kimmy by 11:45. But I didn't! I was drunk over in freeport. Okay, so I slapped her. Sometimes, she'd freeze up on my when I wan-wanted-- wanted to what? -Do some tumbling around. -Tumbling around! Yeah, I can just picture it. You're a sick guy, Donnie. You shouldn't be allowed out in public. A barracuda. She was only 17. Oh, yeah? And what about roxy? You're not reaching into the cradle? Aah! Next time, I'll close my hand. Hey, Mike. I just hate it about those girls. Yeah. What's L.A. say? Earl Bernard worked a full week this week, and three nights overtime, with eyewitnesses. Shirl, no calls from the newspapers. You catch the astros' score? I think it's, uh, 7-4. 7-4 who? I don't know. What inning? I don't know. Oh. This is beautiful. Two weeks ago, they're nine games behind L.A., now it's down to four, and you don't know the score? You're a wellspring of information, shirl. Hey, I never played the game! You did. You should be thankful for 7-4. I am, shirl. I am. Ronnie: Shirl. [ Crowd cheering ] Sportscaster #1: Al burdett will be coming on in the fourth with the astros ahead 7-2 over Pittsburgh. Still some lingering question obviously about baretto's arm. Sportscaster #2: Yeah. Being only the fourth inning, but, hey, that's the smart-money move. You save your hot arm for the stretch drive. Stretch drive. Man, we are in it. Top of the ninth, two out. Baretto has done a masterful job so far. Here's the windup and the pitch. Fine shot to Billy noritt. He's got it. Astros win. Baretto gets the win. Actually, Bob, that's Burnett with the win, because baretto only went four innings, but it was a great job nonetheless. I guess even the great ones make mistakes. [ Turns radio off ] What the... Mikey! I got some bad news for you, Alex. My boss thinks you're a killer. Thinks you rip women apart. I haven't seen you since your father's funeral. You still hittin' the ball, Mikey? Don't drift on me, Alex! I'm talking to you, not about my old man. Why not? He was a nice guy. Used to invite all US guys over for Sunday dinner. We used to toss you around like a satin pillow. Still got the big house? I think you've run out of things to do here. You're gonna have more fun in laredo or eagle pass. I want you to pack and be halfway there by morning. Is that the way you want it? That's the way it's going to be. Okay. Bye, Mikey. You said you were gonna spend the night. I don't wanna go over there. No, it's scary in there. See, it's quitting time. Lorraine, for... It's okay. No problem. Don't go in there! Have a wild time. Come on, Beverly. I'm not going. I'll wait. I'll just wait. Hi. Lorraine, wait. Wait for me! Lorraine, where did you go? Wait...oh! Lorraine! Lorraine, come back here! Beverly! I thought you weren't coming. How did you get there? Go that way. Take a left, okay? Wait for me. -Sure. -Wait! Where did you go? Lorraine! Where are you? Lorraine! I'm getting closer. Lorraine! [ Rustling sound ] [ Beverly laughing ] How do I get out of here? Lorraine? [ Clicking sounds ] [ Footsteps ] Hi. Kinda scary in here, huh? Lorraine? Where did you go? I gotta go now. Oh, god. This handwriting's not the same. It's not. Looks like we might have a right-hander this time. Let me know as soon as you can. Did somebody order a pizza with kielbasa? Yeah, right here. Here. Keep the change. Oh, hey, where's the jalapeno? Want a slice? Will you get outta here? No, I'm sorry. Chief Nelson can't come to the phone right now. I beg to differ with you, sir. I don't believe we're draggin' our ass. In fact, we believe one of the girls last night saw him, and as soon as she's able, we're gonna talk to her. Yes, sir. All right, sir. Thank you for calling. Excuse me. There's a mister... What did you say your name was? -Essex. -Essex...outside. I'll get it. Lieutenant seaver. Can I help you? -Michael seaver? -Yeah. Been a long time since you played with the tri-city pirates. How'd you know that? I keep it all up here in my file. Bill essex, daily newssports page. Oh, yeah, I read you. Good stuff. Thanks. I'm not on the crime beat or anything, but this morning I got a funny call. This guys says what happened with the girls last night wasn't his fault. He was sorry, it was a mistake, something like that. That's it? Think it was some crazy guy? Probably. Babbling brook? Maybe. Thanks for coming by though. Astros got a chance this year? Oh, yeah. Get some hitting. Shirl. I got a meeting with the coroner, then I'll be out and around. If I get any calls, I'll be checking in. I'll tell her. What's the news? It's gonna shock you when I tell you. What? Both virgins. And the sheriff's department had Beverly wakely arrested for vagrancy? That snake broussard. Every time he sees a tight skirt, he hears cash registers ring. That young one-- the little one. She just looked like a nice girl to me, Mike. After this many years, I find I can tell certain things about how a person lived by looking at their remains. Are the dental records up-to-date? Are the nails nicely clipped? Things like that. Salud. Salud. What about the perpetrator? He's a big man. That Lorraine girl-- he was about five feet from her and still able to inflict some heavy damage. I've never seen anything like it. Starts at the ear and rips out the windpipe. The impact knocks out four teeth on the way down, fractures the collarbone. What about the weapon? About what you said. A hook's good enough. It was the left hand. -Lefty? -Mm-hmm. But forensics said the guy who wrote on the mirror was a righty. Science is science, seaver. Big man, left hand. That Lorraine girl-- she was slightly taller than average height, yet all the killing blows are angled downward, but I wouldn't rule out all right-handers. Mike, we're havin' enough of a business depression without y'all bringin' in tales from the crypt. Okay, Stevie. [ Whispers ] More. There isn't any, except maybe the Beverly wakely girl. She doesn't fit the others. Dark hair, overweight. I thought of that, too. He got the first one, and then, because she was there, she got it. Must have gone into a frenzy. Part frenzy. There was only one wound, and it wasn't clean. Lefty, huh? Stevie: Hey, hey, hey, how about them astros? August, they were 14 out. Now look at 'em. Papers are talkin' like a miracle's about to burst forth. Three games out. Whatever you do, don't believe in miracles. They'll break your heart every time. Autographs. Celebrities, movie stars. It's part of their job. Uh-huh. Broussard picked up your old buddy Alex lynch. I thought you'd wanna know. Oh, Christ! You can scratch a man's hide with that damn thing. How do you use that, Alex? I mean, on the docks? I--i don't do cargo work. I'm a button man. I just keep it with me. I got arthritis awful bad. Yeah, you told me that. I guess we're all gettin' up there, ain't we, Alex? But you could handle yourself in your prime, I know that. You were muscle for old man seaver, weren't ya? People got outta line, you put the arm on 'em, straightened 'em out for a little piece of the pie. Tell me something, Alex. Since the old man bit the dust, who's picking up for him now? Is that still in the family? Mikey! Mikey! I was gonna get on the bus just like you said-- shut up, Alex. Get him outta here. I'm holdin' him. He's a suspect. For what? He's not all that clear where he was when wakely and beasley were murdered. He's clear. How in the hell would you know that, big d.? He was with me. Alex: Right! Yeah. Get him outta here! Not in 15 minutes, not in an hour, not when you goddamn well feel like it, but right now. Alex: What's happenin' to me, Mike? Nothing, Alex. You just got dealt some rotten cards. Night game part 2 of 2 closed captioned sportscaster: Yes, sir, that's a proud young man as the astros take a big lead in this baseball game. Pirates may be wanting to make a pitching change here. Manager Jimmy Leland walking out to the mound. How are you? I called several times. Honey, I've been at it around the clock. Yeah, I know. You're a driven man. If it's not baseball, it's the killer. If it's not the killer, it's baseball. You think we could go someplace else and talk? -Please? -Oh, for Pete's sake. Well, stop the car. This killer--i don't know. May be some kind of a celebrity. Sportscaster: Nobody out. The windup, pitch... Please don't smoke. Lays it down the third base line. Third baseman coming in. Young racing down the first base line... Safe at first base. Single for Gerald young. One run on, one runner on base, nobody out. It's got cut-glass windows. Look, we'll put a couple of thou in paint, wallpaper. Hold it. Oh, my. Stand over there... ...and don't move. [ Car starts ] Mike! Jesus! What is going on here? What happened to you? Ah! Ah! Come on with me. [ Moaning ] What were they looking for? Something I found behind the picture, I think. Here. How's your head? -Hmm? -Hmm? Oh, yeah, it's okay. Seems kind of strange-- pop's recliner, doesn't it? I think your father would approve. Why don't we try the bed for once? Mama? Hey, baby. How you doin'? Good. Hey, look out for my fingernails. What are you doin'? Just set your controls for quiet, cool running. He's bought you a 19-inch color TV for half off. I have a TV. Be careful of my microwave. You know, my TV's just fine. I know that. Does it work? That's it, make jokes. The family that laughs together cries together. What are those wavy lines? That's channel 8, same as usual. It's not the set. Well, now, my old TV gets channel 8 just perfectly. Quiet, cool running, okay? Nobody gets 8. Hit the remote again. All right, sports campers, listen up out there. Put down those coffee cups... Oh, this guy is an asshole. He thinks everything is cute, even the ball scores. ...future hall of famers, is Cindy mcilhenny. That's sil baretto's wife. How do you know that? He's tryin' to make me jealous. This is what happened when they got together on July the fourth. Oh, no! We dug this clip up this morning. Look at this. July fourth. That's when the first girl was murdered. Cindy, sil. Sil? Tell me something, sil. Roxy: That's St. Anthony's in Houston. ...compatible with a stretch drive? You'll have to find out, Stan. How about you, Cindy? Get right in here. Tell me, how do you react to all this-- the passion of a pennant race? Go, 'stros! -Yeah, St. Anthony's. -Mama, look at that dress. Shh. If you were wondering how all this turned out, well, her husband will be pitching out at the dome tonight. She said it twice in front of both of US. My mother was very sweet. I didn't say that she didn't say it. It was the way she said it. "Thanks." I mean, she didn't say, "oh, Mike, that was so thoughtful of you." Oh, no, none of that. Nitpicker. Maybe I'm exaggerating. Maybe giving somebody a television set doesn't mean anything anymore. It's supposed to be a cute movie. News gave it three and a half stars. Sure you won't change your mind? No, I can't. I just got a feeling about something. I gotta follow it up. I'll pick you up at...7:30? Okay. [ Mockingly ] Oh, Mike. That was so thoughtful of you. Very funny. Denise dickson-- ever heard of her? No. No, I haven't. Oh, thank you. You and sil were married in Houston, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. At? St. Anthony's church. When? On the fourth of July. No, I mean, what time of day? In the afternoon, and then we left. You left? We drove straight to the airport. We went to Cancun and spent our honeymoon there for the weekend. But sil had to be back on Monday morning to train with the trainer. His shoulder was bothering him. So you didn't spend the night of the fourth in Houston? No. Have you gotten anything in the mail that's like, uh... Strange--little pieces of paper or notes? Things that say "best of luck," "stay well"? Anything like that? Sil mentioned some weird notes that came into his fan mail once. But they gave it to the team officials, and they turned it over to the police. It turned out to be this really wild girl who was really hot for my husband. He didn't say what was in them? No, he doesn't like to worry me. I can understand why. Well, thanks for the iced tea. Oh, this is a beautiful photo. I had my hands over my head. I thought I might get hit by the bat. Was this taken outside the church? Yeah, it was right before we got in the limousine. Yeah, mccann, lozaro, Davis... And who's the shy guy? -Where? -Right there. I don't know. I've never noticed before. Could I borrow this? Why? Well, Denise dickson was murdered behind this church on the fourth of July. Just for a couple of days? All right. But I'll have to tell sil. Yeah. Hey, Sam! How ya doin', lieutenant? What's up? Blow this up for me. Especially up here by the column. Sure. Oh, look at the time. I gotta go. Hi, Davy. Hey, roxy. What's goin' on? You seen that bum fiance of mine? No, but can I give you a ride somewhere? Yes, you may. Boy, am I glad you showed up. Oh, yeah? Sportscaster: Looking in for the signal. Nobody on, two out, bottom of the ninth inning. Bonilla is the last man away from another simply incredible win. The windup, pitch... Called, strike one. I feel like walking. Right here is good. Well, all right. Thanks for the ride, Davy. You have fun now. Hey, I'm on a tear. This is 6-y, galveston. Who's on? 6-y, this is Elsie. Elsie, do me a favor. Give a call home, see if anybody's there. Will do, 6-y. Thanks. Sportscaster: Ball one, high and outside. Bonds laid off. Baretto looking in for the signal. ...caminiti coming in, charging, firing to first base. He nailed him. He's out of there. Barry bonds is out. Hey, roxy, come on and have a drink. You have one for me, Carlo. -Hey, roxy! -Hey, Danny. -How you been? -Fine. How are you? A lot better now. You gonna ask me to dance or just stand here? Sportscaster: Bobby bonilla up. Elsie: Dispatcher to 6-y, dispatcher to 6-y. Yeah, 6-y. Go ahead. Mike, this is Elsie. I called your house; No response. Thanks. Baretto looks in for the signal. The windup, pitch... So how have you and Mike been gettin' along lately? Do you have to spoil it? Sportscaster: The crowd coming to its feet. They can sense the astros are not too far away from another win if they can just nail bonilla right here. Baretto looks in. The pitch. High fly ball deep to left field. Deep to left field, Kevin bass going back... Back... got it at the warning track. Astros win, silvio baretto wins. [ Ringing ] [ Ringing continues ] [ Drunken laughter ] Are you gonna be long? I have to use it, too. Where's mendoza? Across the street a while ago. Who else is on? Me and mendoza on this end, grash later, three guys from the motor division are supposed to be backin' US up. What the hell's the matter with Ronnie? Sit down. Sit down. Finish. Doesn't he know this guy's around here? He's gotta be laughing at US. -You hear him? -Hear what, lieutenant? Sit down, sit down. Where you from, bibbee? Brenham, sir. Hmm. German, huh? You know, this whole island was once covered by the sea. Yeah, in 1900. It was only about seven feet high then before they put the seawall in. What happened was, one afternoon, the barometer started to drop. At night, this giant wall of water came washing in-- capsizing houses, washing away people. Even the graveyards gave up their dead. Bodies everywhere. I wanna get this guy, bibbee. [ Drunken muttering ] Look, I don't need a ride from you. Forget it. Come on! What are you doing? Stop it! Damn it! [ Crying and muttering ] No! No! No! [ Sobbing ] Please. No! I didn't do anything... [ Screaming ] [ Men laughing and talking ] [ Phone rings ] [ Whistling ] Seaver. Where? I'll be right there. Goddamn it! Hey, breakfast. [ Door closes ] This morning, they give me a crew of four guys. The assignment was to do clean-up. So we come in the back road, we come around the corner down there. We parked the truck about three-quarters of the way down the road. We come upstairs-- I come upstairs with the tools. I bring the tools up first. The guys, they always start downstairs with the coffee. So I get to the top of the stairs, and I see this blood on the floor. I figured you guys would want to know what it was all about. I didn't touch nothin'. I come in through this door here, and that's when I found her. That looney tune seaver is holdin' out on US, son. He's withholding evidence. He was over in Houston the other day conducting interviews. He got pushy, too, with the wife of one of them astro ballplayers. -Good morning. -Michael. Who did you send to my house the other night? Pimp! You chicken shit! I want to see you come to my door! That's enough, both of you. Back off! Arresting Beverly wakely on a vagrancy charge. She was a virgin, you pussy peddler! Michael, shut up now. He can't. He's too stupid. Kyle! How are y'all? Lamar. Don't let 'em within 100 yards. We gotta crack down on these bastards from the get-go. Governor said no. Now, aside from being blonde-- what the hell do you think you're doing? This is a police barricade. What agency are you from? Michael... No, no. Let me straighten you out so you don't run around here half-cocked. Something called a chain of command from the governor's office. Somebody yanks the chain, causes a ripple effect. Yank, yank, yank. It's nothing personal against anybody. You're seaver, right? Used to be with Dallas? Yes, sir. Okay. We're all professionals here. Let's cool down. What happened to you? Oh, it's nothin'. It's nothin'. All right, what I pieced together-- we got five women killed over an eight-week period. No, sir. We've got six women killed over a 2 1/2 month period. Thank you for that. Now I want to set out some decoys. It's too late for decoys. He's starting to change. If we employ decoys now, from where I sit, he's gonna move further off. From where I sit, you're sittin' in the back seat. Lamar. Now don't blow it, old hoss. It's gonna be Dallas all over again, and I won't be able to cover your ass. Michael, take a break. Just stay home for a few days. You pullin' me off this homicide? Don't pull that departmental horseshit with me. Damn! Why the hell am I always havin' to con you into getting off of the goddamn railroad tracks. When a fuckin' train's barrelin' down right on top of you? Goddamn it. Wow! This is appliqued satin with organza ruffles and the veil is seed Pearl. I adore it. It's beautiful. Oh, god, it's-- may I talk to her for just a moment? Listen, honey, when we planned this thing, we said we wanted a nice, simple, intimate ceremony, right? -Just family and-- -rich and Davy. Yeah, yeah. And you agreed to that, right? Well, now we got little cousin Jessica throwin' flowers, and we got 60 people in the big room at the galvez for champagne. We got a ten-piece band with an emcee. I wonder whose idea that was. Mm, forget the emcee. I don't need the dress. I'll just come down the aisle bare-assed. Honey, that's not what i'm... That's not what I'm saying. I want you to keep the dress. But 60 people at the galvez? That's not our wedding; That's Alma's wedding. -Alma? -Alma. -My mother? -Your mother. Just take the dress. We'll talk about it later. Oh, baby! It's the orange shoes. The orange shoes don't quite make it with the dress. Good morning. Where's the train? Somebody's taking the train? [ Chuckles ] The train for the children to carry. What children? There's Susan and Allen and Jeffrey. They're second cousins once removed. Wait a minute. The Duke and duchess of windsor didn't have as many people as you want. At the very beginning, we said we would have-- "we, we, we"?! You said it. That's the damn problem. Sweetheart, didn't you have to be someplace? Nothing I do is good enough for this woman. She doesn't like my house, she doesn't like my car, she doesn't like the way I walk, she doesn't like the way we're gonna get married, and cops she hates on general principle. Ha! I respect the police. I do not respect cops. I don't think this is the occasion to have this discussion. I'm very nice to this woman. I bought her a TV set with a monitor, stereo. How many people have that kind of a television set? Why don't you take it back? I'd be delighted to take it back. It still does not get channel 8, and 5 is not all that good either. I'm paying for that set in 12 monthly installments. Oh, well, let's see. You have paid for one week. How much is that? Ten dollars at most? That's it, that's it! Tonight you unplug it and you put it right outside the front door. Why don't both of you just shut up about that lousy TV?! The front door! I would be delighted to put it out the front door. I do not have to take this. The front door! There is a mad killer loose, and he is drivin' around at taxpayers' expense. Good riddance! Now...show US a dress with a train. Right here's the 8x10 you give me, right? I take it, I blow it up 600%. Take this section here, and I blow it up 800%. What's that? That's your guy. My guy? That's terrific. The man who never was. Hey, Mike. Boy wins again. Hmm. Baretto wins. And I lose. Baretto wins. And I lose. Baretto wins. September 14. -Night game. -Night game. Astros over the giants, 4-3. Baretto went the distance. Say, these dates-- anything to do with-- just keep going, bill. Try last night-- September 28, astros over the padres. [ Keyboard clacking ] Baretto on the mound. He got the win. And Betty Jo Hansen is murdered in the condo on the beach. All right. Silvio baretto is a celebrity judge in a miss Texas beauty pageant. That's where he meets Cindy mcilhenny, right? Baretto pulls his shoulder in the middle of the month of June. Right. July 4, he's still on the disabled list, so he uses the time off to marry Cindy. Monday morning, he's back for treatments. But on the night of July 4, Denise dickson is found in the dumpster behind the church where he got married. August 19, shoulder is recovered, he pitches, he wins. -Kimmy Martinez. -Yeah. Astros went on a road trip right after that. Okay, now. Back at the dome September 14, baretto pitches and wins, and Loretta akers goes for her car on the beach. September 19, burdett... Burdett. Oh, shit! Burdett, baretto. That was the phone call you got. The guy who said it wasn't his fault; it was a mistake. Oh, my god. I remember that game. They kept calling burdett baretto after burdett came on in the fourth. But the killer thought baretto won the game, so he kills beasley and he gets the wakely girl 'cause she happens to be there. Then his pattern is... Night game at home... ...but only if baretto wins. Somewhere in that twisted cave he calls a brain, he's trying to grab the headlines from baretto. Those little pieces of paper he keeps tearing off are autographs to his fans. Witty's takin' over, huh? Yep. We're movin' furniture around. What for? Witty's office. Laura Ashley's pillows and shit. This island's gonna sink with so much extra personnel. Houston, San antone, Dallas. It's Ronnie's fault. He should've told the governor to go to hell in the first place. Come on, Mike, will you let up on him? You're breakin' my heart. Okay, shove it. Hey, where's the appointment book? What book? Oh. I forgot. Ran my ass off runnin' these numbers down, but you were right. Thanks, Oscar. Just doin' a job. Uh-huh. Hey, Michael. You better try that again. That's right. If at first you don't succeed, you try, and you try again. Isn't that right? Uno mas. Uno mas. Uno mas. [ Drunken muttering ] All right, why don't you say it? Go ahead. I'm just a chicken-livered chicken shit with no guts. Just a yes man for Lamar, tryin' to protect my job. Isn't that what you wanted to say? Huh? Have another drink. Well, you'd be right, 'cause it's the goddamn truth. I envy you, Michael. I do. I envy you. You don't care about the governor's office. And that son of a bitch Kyle. I'll bet he's havin' a field day havin' to bite his goddamn tongue to keep from laughin' right in my face. You think so? Yeah. I think he is. I mean, you gotta consider... My stock was cut higher than his up to now. Was it? Yeah, it was. What do you want? Well, I was lookin' at you today, and you looked like a tired old bloodhound off the scent. So I said to myself, "seaver, old buddy, "why should you have all the glory? Why not share some with your old pal Ronnie?" What the hell is that? Don't be throwin' me no bones, old hoss. This old dog can still hunt. This is Loretta akers' appointment book. A record of all her dates. One number seems to keep popping up. I think you oughta try it, on me. On you? Yeah, on me. This damn shit must be good. [ Phone rings ] Hello. Hello? Hello?! How'd you like to kiss my black cat's ass? Who was that? Nothin'. Well, I'll be damned. You are worth all the pain and the travail, aren't you, old hoss? I knew it. I knew it! I knew you would be. [ Chuckles ] The state attorney general's office ain't gonna be too happy about this corruption. Hey, Steve, you give this son of a bitch anything he wants. No. I'm outta here. What do you mean? Come on, we're havin' a beer. Play a game. Where you goin'? I'm goin' to the ballgame. And hello, sports fans, and welcome to Houston astros baseball. This is your friend the Duke down here at the dome where I'll be joining my old pal Bob Allen for tonight's game. Boy, the astros can do it tonight! If that sky opens up, that's where I'll be-- right there in the astrodome. You can bet your ass on that. Y'all want anything to drink? Iced tea? Dr. Pepper? What's with her? What's with you? Wedding's postponed. Postponed? He attacked my mother. That's not too smart. He could get himself injured. Lighten up. [ Cheering and applause ] Big Mike Marshall stepping in to start the second inning. Marshall's had 26 long balls for the Dodgers so far this season. What do you say, bill? Hey, lieutenant, how ya doin'? It's been a rough day. I need this. Goddamn! Back, right field. Home run. Shit! Damn, I shoulda been there. Alma, I shoulda been there. Always, Rick. Baseball. Shoot! Honey, I just hope you're not makin' a big mistake. He is a lot older than you. Besides, he knows that weddings cost money, and he knows there is no daddy in our family. Believe me, a man, if he does not pay any attention to the finer points in life, will usually leave you high and dry. I suppose playin' gin with my mother for the rest of my life is a better alternative? I gotta leave. Now where you goin'? Listen to some music. Stay off the streets, you hear me? I will. Ball four. Ryan walks, and it looks like he doesn't have that usual gas on the ball. You gotta wonder just how long lanier is gonna stay with him. You really get into it, don't you? Yeah. So they'll probably bring... Let me see this. Sure. Guess who is in the bullpen warming up... Baretto. Where'd he come from? He's homegrown. Down from the farm system. Cuban-American. Likeable kid. They have to make a place for him? You got me there. Wayne...what the hell. Wayne givens. Yeah, they sent him down to Tucson. Dickerson--talented but lazy. They released him. There was one more; A pitcher. He would've been the guy. Who was he? Epps. Yeah, Floyd epps out of Marshall, Texas. Yeah, they released him to make room for baretto. You talk about a bad day. The day he was released, the bus he was riding on collided with a semi outside of las cruces. Had to amputate his hand. Pitching hand. He was a lefty, too. P.A.: Now pitching for the astros, number 10, silvio baretto. This is 6-y galveston. Punch me through to headquarters and hurry. Mike, this is Ronnie. Ronnie, the guy we're looking for is named Floyd epps. E-p-p-s. Epps. Gotta be someplace in the bay area where he can get on and off the beach. All right, check that. Epps. E-p-p-s, Floyd. Move! Now listen to me, Ronnie. Every time baretto pitches and wins, this guy strikes. He came in tonight in the sixth inning. That means that epps is due to go again on the beach. Got it? Copy that. Here it is, chief. Got a traffic citation for parkin' in the handicapped zone. Failure to display his handicapped sticker. Address is 1444 old piling road, Bailey's creek. -We got him, Mike. -All right. Radio: Keep lookin' all you want. He's not gonna see that ball. Mike! Mike! Let's go. All right, we get to arrest the man. No, no. Kyle, if I were you, I'd get myself a good defense attorney. What do you mean? The governor doesn't take kindly to runnin' whores out of the sheriff's department. Runnin' whores? Lamar... [ Dance music plays ] Top of the ninth... Two outs. Astros lead it 2-1. Mr. Clutch kirk Gibson up with a 2-2 count. And we're down two-in', huh, Bob? It's long, it's hot..., -it's down the left field-- -hook foul! -Could be. -Hook foul! It is! Home run! [ Whispering ] This is galveston police department. We have a warrant. Open up. Police. It's clear! Look at this. Silvio baretto pitching. This inning, due up... Ronnie: Mike? Mike, are you there? Yeah, Ronnie, go ahead. It's him, Michael, but we missed the son of a bitch. You be careful now. Sorry, lieutenant. Doin' the job. [ Glass shatters ] Jesus! What a drag. Man, are you okay? I think 1,000 times, fast ball, got him swingin'. That's the pitch that put the astros into the playoffs. We are headed to the league championship series right now. Thank you. Thank you. [ Siren blaring ] This is 6-y, seaver. I'm coming over the causeway. I want you to clear a path for me on seawall. I'll be heading east. Oh, man! Hey, listen, I gotta go up to Davy's room. I'll meet you at the bar. Okay. See ya later. Where's roxy? Shoot, I wouldn't tell you doodly-squat after the way you behaved. Alma, where is she?! She said she wanted to hear some music. The balinese room. Thanks. Excuse me. This is the ladies room. [ Kitchen workers chattering ] Steaks? Ready. Okay, I got some fries here. [ Roxy gasps ] [ Both yelling ] Open the door! Hey! Hey! Hey! Man: What the hell? Woman: What's goin' on? Mike! You let her go, epps. You don't know me. Sure, I do. Lloyd epps. Goddamn it! My name's Floyd epps. Get it right! Floyd epps, Tucson. '96. Pretty good fast ball, right? Put that gun down. Put it down! Now you gotta let her go. You stay the fuck away from me! You're gonna let her go, right? Nobody's gonna take anything from me anymore. I know what it's like to be sent down. She took the crowd away from me. She took my fans away from me. She took the fucking game away from me, and you gave me this. Mike! [ People screaming ] Now pitching for the astros, number 10, pitcher silvio baretto. On the mound for the astros, sil baretto. And he's finishing up his warm-up pitches. We're ready for a big one, Bob. Okay, wait a minute. What's he doing? Looks like he's leavin' the field for some reason. Where do you think you're goin'?! Lieutenant seaver. Yeah. This is my bride roxy. Hi. How are you? -Congratulations. -Thank you. Enjoy the game. We will. Hey, sil. Thanks for all the thrills. Let's play ball!
