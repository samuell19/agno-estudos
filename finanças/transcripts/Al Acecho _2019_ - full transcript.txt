ARGENTINE FEDERAL POLICE Stand there. Okay, break it. Come on! Police! Freeze! On the floor! Come on! Nobody move! On the floor! What is this? -Freeze! -On the floor! -Wait! What the fuck…? -Come on! -Stop it, man! -Come here, come on! -I'm a park ranger! -We'll see, you just stay put. Take him over there. Come on. Put him there. Sit down, come on. TWO WEEKS LATER PEREYRA IRAOLA BIOSPHERE RESERVE DO NOT PASS PARK RANGER STATION SAN JUAN SECTOR Hi. PEREYRA IRAOLA PROVINCIAL PARK -I'm Silva. -Rodríguez. Didn't you know? I was just transferred here. Oh, no, I didn't know a thing. That's weird. -Okay. -Okay, come in. This is Silva. He says he was transferred here. I was just told about it. Have a seat. -When did you get transferred? -Yesterday, at the end of the day. It's just temporary. Yes, it is. Okay. Venandi asked for you to wait at the yard. Okay. Are you staying here? If I'm allowed to, yes. We should get the shed ready for him to stay, right? We'll get it cleaned up for you. It's a bit damp, but that's all we have. Don't worry, I'll be okay. Welcome. -Silva? -Hello. Claudio Venandi. Here. -Did you find your way here okay? -Yes. Have you met the others? -I met Márquez, and Rodríguez too. -Good. Let's walk around the place. Come with me. I haven't been in the backyard in a long time. I served here when I was drafted. What about you? Well, in 1977, after what happened to Carrasco, I wasn't drafted. Poor kid. Come. This used to be the dining room. They'd put a screen there to show films. We'd always watch the same action movies. Just look at this place now. Silva? I know why you were sent here. I read your file. In another time, you'd have been discharged for poaching. Now your punishment is being sent here. I had nothing to do with that. I was the first park ranger here. It took a lot of effort to be accepted by the farmers, to gain the visitors' respect, to get the Army out of here. For many, this was just a dump, but I turned it into land that is worth taking care of. And I won't let anyone ruin all that work. Don't worry. You can have a look around later, come here. Work hard and don't cause trouble. -That's all I ask for. -Yes, sir. When the inquiry ends, if you're telling the truth, you'll surely get another transfer. I want to go back to Paulino island, I love water. Okay. Well, on weekends, I want you to give your best patrolling all day long at the visitors area. We'll see what you can do on weekdays, but there's a lot of work to do at the station. Now Mariano will take you to the shed to make yourself at home. There. And now this one. -It's really dirty. -It's okay, don't worry. I didn't know you were coming or I'd have cleaned. It's okay, it's nice. It's bright and airy. -Is there electric light too? -Yes. Oh, look at that. -Where are you staying? -In Hudson. Yeah. I'm from Pehuajó, but I moved to this area. Okay. -Could you help me with this? -Yes. There. Thanks. Just leave it there. Oh, look. There are blankets here. Good. Okay, I can take it from here. Thanks. -Okay, Silva. -Thanks, Mariano. Hi. Hello. Watch that fire there. Okay, sure. -Sorry to bother you, but… -No problem. Just keep it about six feet away from the tree. Good morning. PARK RANGER There's so much garbage. This is nice. It is, isn't it? This is my favorite swamp. -Down there you have the Pereyra stream. -Here? I'll go there for a minute. The area across the stream is military property. Right. At the end of this path, there's an altar of the Virgin Mary and some sheds. But it's all the same, a privet forest. No soldiers posted there? There's no fixed post. They come sometimes, but not often. Visitors walk around, farmers pass by, but that's it. The farmhands used to live there. Coming up. MILITARY AREA DO NOT PASS Which Virgin is in that altar? There's no Virgin, it's just the altar. The Pereyras built it back then. They made the altar in memory of one of their children. The girl was kidnapped and then disappeared. Allegedly, they had put a gold Virgin there, but those same kidnappers stole it. It's also said someone was trying to settle a score, someone from their own family. Something about an inheritance… I don't remember. Was that a long time ago? Who knows. It's a myth, Silva. It happened in the last century, 1800 something. -So, a long time ago. -Yes. These people became the richest in the country. Have you seen the house? It's said they married their siblings to keep their fortune in the family. This is a weird place, Silva. The only thing that grows here is ruins. Have you looked around? There's nothing left of that empire. Let's take this path, it's shorter. Mariano, come see this. I know that dog. It's Lucía's, she's a farmer. It got caught on this. Wait, we cannot leave it like this. Just look at it. It's dead. It's a dog. Who cares? Leave it there. -But I know its owner. -So? It's not… It's not right? -It's not right. -No. Let's just go in. Hello, Lucía. We brought one of your dogs. We found it dead, poor thing. Thank you. Thanks for bringing it. I thought you'd want it. Well, we thought… He's Silva, a park ranger. Thank you too. No problem, ma'am. -Where was he? -In the military area. The Army used to train there and left traps everywhere. We tried to remove them when we opened the park, but we have problems with them every once in a while. They never wanted us. Racist Army scum. Try not to go down those paths. So the dogs won't follow you. We'll see what we can do, ma'am. Don't worry. Lucía. Nice to meet you. I'm Pablo. -Bye. -Bye. Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Fuck, you can't even walk through here. Wasn't there one around here? Who knows. What? Hey. Hey. Hey. Where do you want to go? You have to stay here, they'll kill you out there. Okay? Check those out. I think they're not getting better. Okay. Calling River, Coast here. River here. How is it going? We're not done yet. Some of them are empty. So? -These are dead. -I told you, you son of a bitch. -Throw them in the garbage. -Okay. About five or six. -We're about to comb the area. -Okay. We have time till the 27th. We'll make it, don't worry. Come on, let's go. Dear God! Fuck! What a piece of shit! God! Fuck! Here. Do you want some more? Here. Here. Come with me. I wanted to talk to you. What is this? What are we? Stretcher-bearers? Veterinarians? We're park rangers. Then why don't you do just that? I don't know what you mean, sir. I mean entering a military area and providing funerary services. Mariano, I sent you to show him the park boundaries, and you did that instead? -It won't happen again. -Of course it won't! Sir, I was just tired from the long walk, so I took the shorter route. Then I saw the dead animal. Mariano recognized it, he felt bad for the owner. I told him to take the dog. Don't blame him, it was my call. Oh, you're a good co-worker too! What a nice hand they sent us! You said there were problems with the farmers. Well, I wanted to help defuse the situation. If you want to help, there's a lot you can do here. Camila, make a list of chores for your co-worker. -Will do. -And you, since he's here, see to everything you can't do alone. Yes, Venandi, don't worry. Yeah, go ahead, have a laugh! Come with me, Mariano. Turn that way. Help me, come on. Thank you. I'll be back in half an hour. -I'll wait for you here. -No, go take a walk. No, I'll wait here. Go, have a look around. Okay. DO NOT ENTER RECOVERY ROOM Camila? NO MOSQUITOES, NO DENGUE Oh… are you new? I'm a temp. Being in the dark makes them calmer. Have you ever been to the Wildlife Care Center before? No, it's my first time here. Can you give me a hand? -I apologize. I'm Marcos. -Silva. Open this for me. Are all these animals local? Yes, almost all of them. They come from fairs, circuses and private collectors. There's a lot of them. Yeah, they come from all around the province. But the ones that survive must later adapt to the habitat. Once you release them, most of them die. That's still better than a fucking cage. Hey, doc. Park ranger Camila Márquez. -How are you? Are you okay? -Yes, everything's fine. -So? Did you have a look around? -Yes, I did. -Did you introduce each other? -Yes. I was just telling him what we do here. Or at least what we try to do, right? Did you have a veterinarian there? No, I was alone. -Where were you? -Paulino island. -And who took care of the animals? -Either me or whoever was there. And we dare complain? -Yeah. Lucky us, we have Saint Venandi. -Don't start. He's the best veterinarian in the area. -Well… -That's true. Okay. Bye, my friend. -Talk to you later. -Okay, see you later. -See you later, doctor. -Bye. -Who is it? -Silva! -Hello. -Hello. Come here. -Take it off. -Help me. What is that? On your wrist. -I did some time in prison. -What for? -Didn't they tell you yet? -No. Really? What's Venandi's problem with me? And with you, and the farmers, and the Army? What's his deal? With the farmers… there's bad blood. This was government land. President Perón divided it and gave it to farmers, who settled here, and now they want to kick them out. It's always the same. They also logged here for a living. When we arrived, that was over for them. And why are you here? Nobody likes it here, but I do. It's quiet, and I love nature. How many places like this are left? Almost none. How are you, Silva? -Is there a problem? -No. I was looking at this picture. Did you see it? It's been here since I arrived. Who's that? I don't know, but I feel I've known him all my life. I brought something for you. Here. They closed the inquiry of your case. I said I had nothing to do with it. -So, justice was served? -That's right. What are you going to do? Maybe I'll go back to Paulino island. You still have a few days to ask for the transfer. I'm not saying we'll miss you, but… Joking aside, this uniform, all of this deserves respect. Make the most of the chance you've been given. I will, sir. Let me know if you choose Paulino island. UNIFORMS - SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NOTES Mariano, do you need a hand? Pass me the 15 mm wrench. -Let me see… -No, leave it to me. The 15 mm one is fine. We need to talk. What's wrong? Remember Lucía's dog? -The dead one? -Yes. It didn't get tangled, it was a poacher's trap. There are poachers around. Who are they? I don't know. But I know they're there. -Where did you seen them? -In the military area. -They must be soldiers. -They're not. They are two local farmers, I saw them. Well, it's their problem. -Oh, it's their problem? -Yes. That's nice. Are the animals there different from the ones in the park? They're one and the same, what's wrong with you, man? I don't want trouble. Unless they enter the park, I won't do a thing. So you'll leave me on my own. Mariano, you're a wuss! Don't say that. We were told off already, remember? -What do you plan to do? -Go and face them. That's my plan. -What did you smoke? -Nothing! What do you mean by that? Let's go to Venandi. I won't go after anyone outside of my jurisdiction. It is our jurisdiction, Mariano! They are setting traps and poaching in a provincial park! We're park rangers! What the fuck are you talking about? -Be a man! Don't be a wuss! -Stop calling me a wuss! I just came out of a bad situation. I want to clear my name and do what's right. They are poaching in our park. We must go after them. I can't go alone, there are two of them. I need you. Listen, they're there. Do you hear them? Pretend you carry a gun. Keep your hand behind your back. Don't move, you fuckers. Don't move. That goes for you too. What a nice cage. What are you hunting, guys? What are you talking about? That cage you have there, you son of a bitch, that's what I'm talking about. What? Is it a crime now to clean our tools in the stream? Do you know them? No, I don't. But we do know you. -Shut up. -Did you grow a pair all of a sudden? Shut up, you son of a bitch! Shut up! I know those cages you hunt with very well. Who do you work for? I work for nobody. Okay, then I'm sure we can reach an agreement. -What do you want? -Money. If you want to hunt here, you must pay the park rangers. How much should we ask for? How much money do you make? I'll have your message delivered. See? I knew you were a minion. Okay, minion, get lost! Take your little cage and scram! Give them our message. Did you hear me? Tell them about it. -What was that? -What? What you said about the money. I said it so he would admit working for somebody else. Where are those cages from? -How should I know? -Why did you say you did? For the same reason, Mariano. They're working for someone. -It turned out I was right. -You're lying to me! I was trying to trick them. Should I explain it to you again? They're working with someone else. Can't you see what's going on here? -I don't know. I'll talk to Venandi. -Talk to Venandi? Are you stupid? What will you tell him? That you entered the military area? -You brought me here. -I brought you here? Yes. Look at that. Jump into the river, come on. See? You didn't jump. Don't bust my balls, it was your decision to come along. -I don't want trouble. -Neither do I. Wouldn't you like to stay? I didn't know you knew. Venandi told me. He told me that your situation was solved. I thought, since you like the place… We can cover for each other. It'd be a win-win situation. I don't know. I can see you're at ease here. I have to think about it. You do that. Look at this. What is that? It's medicine the veterinarian smuggles out. What medicine? I don't understand. Your friend, the veterinarian, smuggles medicine out. He's doing it himself. Anyone could get that medicine. Not from this shipment. Anybody can come in and take it! I don't know. You have to trust me, I can't tell you more. -You're an asshole. -No, that guy in there is the asshole! Now go in there and ask him about this. I can't believe it. That's why you brought me here. He'll talk to you and tell you the truth. He won't talk to me. Why? Because he's my friend? -Do you want me to grill him? -Yes. He won't tell me the truth. -I was right, wasn't I? -He won't do it again. I'll be right back. -So now you decide to show up? -I knew it was you! Son of a bitch! Wait! I'll stop doing it! -What will you stop doing? -I swear. I saw everything, man! Shut up while I'm talking! I saw everything, I was at the warehouse, asshole! I was there! I saw the cages! I saw your handwriting on the logs! -No, I… -I heard it on the radio! I know everything! Now shut up! You know what you're going to do? You'll talk to those two little shits and tell them they work for me now. -It doesn't work that way. -Oh, doesn't it? So it doesn't work that way? Asshole! What doesn't work that way? It does! No, it doesn't. You have three days, man. You go and convince them. Or I'll come back and stab you, got it? Do you want some more? Yes? Here. Do you want some more? Here, little guy. Here. Camila. Can we talk for a minute, please? Can we talk? Only for a minute. Speak. -Have you seen Mariano? -No. When was the last time you saw him? You're so shady, Silva. Why are you looking for him? Something bad is about to happen. Something bad is happening. We haven't heard from your co-worker in two days. -That's why I'm telling you. -Yeah. It's dangerous to be here, you must leave. It is. There are many backstabbers around here. "Backstabbers"? What are you implying? -Say what you want to say! -Did you fuck up? -I didn't. -Tell me the truth. -I didn't! -What do you know about Mariano? It's dangerous to be here, let's go. You're so hardworking. Do you care about your co-workers now? I care about my co-workers, and I care about you. -Listen to me, let's go. -I won't leave my post. Listen to me, Camila! It's dangerous! Let's go! I'm on duty. -We must go. -I won't go anywhere! Don't be stubborn, come with me! -Leave me alone, Silva! -Don't be an ass! DO NOT PASS Fuck! PARK RANGER Silva! Camila! Stay put, you son of a bitch! Drop that gun! Come here! Wait, Pablo, you're making a mistake. Where's Mariano? That wuss left. He took your truck. Calm down, come here. I was going to offer you a deal. I've heard enough of you, you fucker. Shut up, you piece of shit. Listen. Some people will be here in a minute to take the animals. I heard everything on the radio, man. I don't need you anymore. But you'll be transferred next week, you moron! I can arrange for you to stay. This is a hunting ground, Silva. We can get rich. We can share the money. Where's my fox? At the back with the rest. Keep it if you want. We'll go 70-30. Okay. Okay. -Take me to the Center to heal my wound. -No. We'll make the sale first. We'll do that in the morning. Take me to the Center now. Pablo, I won't make it with this fucking tourniquet! Calm down, you'll make it. What time will it be? Soon. Where? We have to make a call. Don't try to be a smart-ass. Don't try anything funny. Be careful what you say. Come on, make the call. Tell them you're going with a business partner. Okay. And you put down that gun, we're partners now. Come on. Calling River, Coast Four here. Calling River, Coast Four here. River here. Go ahead. Is the sky clear? It seems that it's going to be a beautiful morning. Yeah. Perfect. We'll be waiting with full boxes. -Fine. -River. What's up? My business partner will come with me to welcome you. Say again? My business partner will come with me to welcome you. We'll be in my truck. I'm having some health issues. Hold on a minute. Coast? Go ahead. See you at 6:00 at the base of the breakwater. Copy that. Okay, let's go. Will you help me out? Are you the business partner? Yes. Where's Venandi? He's in the truck. He's dead. -He didn't make it. -What do you mean by that? He got in a shooting with one of the hunters, I think. And who the fuck are you? I'm the one who brought you the animals anyway. Let's go see them. Let's go see what you brought. Come on, move. Dammit. How could Venandi be so stupid? Having himself killed for so little money. Will you keep bringing them? Yes. What's your name? Silva. Oh. So? There's one missing. Really? How many are there? There's a fox missing. Let's see… -Here it is. -No, not that fox. "Not that fox"? What do you mean by that? That fox is not for sale, sir. -What do you think this is? -Keep the money. The fox stays. Are you stupid? Who the fuck do you think you are? What…? What are you doing? Leave it, let's go. I'm sorry.
