Antoine, my boy. You had a bad dream? A nightmare. Nanny, I dreamed I was working. Oh, my poor little! Quick, let's go home. You have overdone enough for today. Dear Nanny, For 25 years, I have blessed the derailment that killed my parents. No orphan was happier than me under the supervision of his grandfather. Antoine, never make any effort. Fatigue is the enemy. You need, to succeed everywhere and always, never work. It is a mistake to believe that laziness is a default. It is, on the contrary, the mother of all virtues. But the Bible says : "You will earn your bread by the sweat of your brow." But after original sin! Before, man lived as a shiftless layabout. By the way, all religions have decreed a weekly rest. The faithful are aware that they are offering their laziness to the Lord. Show me. Add a drop of Chartreuse. Friday, we're Arabs. Saturday, we're Jews. Sunday, we're Christians. And the month of Sundays. Checkmate. That's why, I tell you, don't torment yourself about what you can eat to live. Look at the birds in the sky. They make no sowing nor reaping and they don't pile up in attics because our Father feeds them. Learn that lesson. Being a sparrow. This is an art you inherited at birth. God feeds the sparrows. The society will nourish you. The important is to be re-invited. The secret : Be a nice guy. Smile with the sensible. Sneer with the cynics. Laugh up with fools. Get indignant with the fiery. Sigh with the gloomy. And with the talkers... I let them talk. Huh? You were saying? The satellite disappears behind the outer ring. - "The outer ring." Slowly. - "Slowly." Slowly! Slowly! But just think, little wretch, miserable worm, that Flammarion himself said...Wait... "We sail in the vastness" "at a speed a thousand times greater" "that a fast train's." "A wonderful sidereal mechanism," "the Earth is softer than the gondola" "abandoned on the mirror of the Venetian lagoon." "The Earth glides" "majestically" "on its ideal orbit." "All that is divine is effortless." Aeschylus. Poor Antoine Mirliflore. I looked after the interests of your grandfather in his lifetime. What a charming philosopher, but so careless! Do you know that the sale of its properties, those without mortgages, will barely cover the inheritance tax? My dear sir, what else can we ask for? I admire your composure in the face of such a disaster. Now you own nothing. My poor sir. No parents, no relations. There you are all alone. Let me introduce you to one of my friends. He will help you find a trade, a situation. A situation, me? Perpetual holiday is over. You must work, young man. Work, me? Dear sir, there is no question of it. But...but... Good life, gentlemen. Paris, it's you and me. You need your campstool? - Yes, no, well... It's not warm. What you see in there? The cosmos. Ah? Get a look in there. I see nothing. We see nothing. No, no, nothing. Pay him. Ice cream, peanuts, special pictures. David, look at that! That's good. Look at that. David. Pig! Talk about a customer. Oh, I don't despair. I started by selling newspapers. Yes, I, Balthazar! As Henry Ford, but I, I have not forgotten to be stupid. I studied the economic situation. Believe me, the future is the ice cream. All over Paris. In 10 years, everywhere. "Bathazar's Ice Cream." Why not "Balthazar's Hot Chestnuts"? So really, we see nothing in your thing? You see, I have a broad who lives across the street. 5, St. Peter's Square. - A broad? Lovely? - Oh my! Where? 2nd window on the left, around the corner. Charming. - She's not bad. Not bad at all. She has the phone? - Montmartre 10-12. You have a token? - And how! What's her name? - Nicole. Hello? - Hello, Nicole ? Yes? You must never flood a geranium. Who is calling? Antoine. Don't put your watering can in balance, it could fall. Well, you can sit down. There. You are much better like that. You know that pink suits you really, really well? Oh, wonderful! I didn't know this aspect of your personality. Oh, you're just... a big slob, a lout, a despicable individual, a jailbird, a fool... - No! You think this is funny? - Nicole! Nicole, Nini, it's Balthazar! Listen, sweetheart! - Is that you? Nini... - Farewell. Very funny, your joke. Very funny. You witness the end of a great love. Don't do anything stupid. It is in the test that turn out great souls. This is too much, I'm going to see her. - Not in your condition. I must! - I'll go, it's my fault. I'll fix it for you. Thank you. - We are quite friends. I always knew I could count on you. Don't show up before tomorrow, you could ruin everything. Ah, the good boy. Still here? Always in my legs! I'm sorry. Batlthazar. It's all over between us. PS : I'll be back at half past midnight. Ah, thank you. Shooo. Charming. Good. Perfect. Oh! But who is there? Antoine? Well, where are you? Who's that guy? Oh, Nicole... How can I apologize for this? I've spent frightful hours at the idea of ​​having hurt this poor little fragile thing. I am a wretch. The funicular crushing my body would have been a too easy death. As penance, I climbed 6 floors on my knees. It's not enough. What to do to give you this just revenge? To offer myself as a martyr? Here I am. I am at your mercy. Scold me, beat me, kill me. Wow, what a speech... Ah, she has forgiven me. Oh, great lady, noble Nicole. Generous Nicole, admirable Nini. Can I keep you company? Well, what a man... "All that is divine is effortless." Antoine. Antoine, the coffee is ready. I'm going to work. See you later, darling. Oh, the Sacred Heart. Hello? Yes? Who? Balthazar? Oh, I see... Calm down, man. I'll explain later. Alright, come on up. Say, can you bring me croissants? Thank you, man. See you in a sec. You beast! Antoine, big slob! First, would you be kind enough to take off my housecoat? Coffee? But you really think you're at home! I must admit I spent the night here. I couldn't sleep under bridges. Nicole is an amazing girl. You seem worried. But believe me, man to man, I didn't touch her. Oh! Come on, be serious! I must admit I didn't sleep much. Nicole, being under the impression that you broke up with her, spoke about you all night. Ah? - Yes, I even began to hate you. She's crazy about you. Oh! You want me to talk frankly? You're on the wrong track. - Ah? You see, women are fragile. Especially Nicole. She's a small biscuit. Modesty, sensitivity, a variety of feelings. Nicole? - I'm telling you! I must admit that I wasn't looking at her from the right angle. Change your perspective. She hates jealous guys. Be even-tempered, casual, charming and she's yours. She's mine? Thank you, Antoine. Now I understand. All things considered, Nicole, she's a...I got it. You're working today? - No, I'm going to rest. Sun is rising. - Not me. Oh, my little... You will never amount to anything if you sleep all day. Life is a fight. Struggle for life. The law of the jungle. You're going to sell ice cream with such a weather? Always the fallback position. Never unprepared. I am a fighter, you see? If Nicole admires me, it's because I got dough. In ten years... The Rolls, the yacht, the Chinese valet, the Davis cup. The easy life. - And today? Today, I just tinker around, okay. But I'm up to something. Are you interested in Photo-stop? It's not tiresome. - Ah... I'll get the gear. See you downstairs in an hour. You keep my cigarettes? - Yes I do. And don't forget, boy. Struggle for life. On horseback! What! She can't even iron my shirt? I feel I'm not going to rot in here for long. Psst! Miss! Ernestine. At noon, you will cook the veal with carrots. Yes, madame. Madame, Miss, I'm coming for the leak. The leak? - Yes, in the bathroom. There have been complaints. It won't be long. In the hallway, 1st door on the left. Psst, sir! Sir! Dirty old man! Tease! - Me, madame? Be quiet! And in addition you caused a leak in the bathroom. Me? - Yes, you. I never set foot in there. I will withdraw the plumber's bill from your wages. By the way, what is he doing? I also forbid you to purchase oil in plastic bottle. Oh, sorry. It's done. It works. Would you have a towel? My respects, madame. This boy is charming. Incredible, you mean the bearded guy? Oh, the pig! It's just between us. You know me. - Excuse me, ladies. What a rain! The ten of spades goes on the valet. There you are. - Your feet! What? Your feet! You mess everything. Sorry. Excuse me. And ten points for the last trick. Thank you, Émile. - See you tomorrow, same time? You will stay for lunch, Mr. Antoine. No, no! We're already too late. Taking pictures is extremely time-consuming. The thing is to choose the time, the place...Are you listening? And the customers. The most important, I insist on that, is an impeccable equipment. For God sake! Thanks. I'm doing great! Stop! Your papers. - Me? Do not panic. Oh, sorry. My God! Destroy this photo. 10.000 francs for you. Hey, this is a great idea. How much this one? - 10.000 francs. Stop! Filthy scum! At my age, no one blackmails me! Oh, no! Good heavens, my wife! Good heavens, my husband! What are you doing with this man? Antoine! Antoine, come on, come on! Let's go. Hello, Nicole? Balthazar. No, don't hang up. I'm calling you for professional reasons. The weather has changed. Your scheme with Max, is there still a part in it for us? At 15 pm? Ah, very well! It really helps me out, thank you. See you later...sweetie. Let's go. - It's nice, right? What is this for ? - It turns when there is light. I see, it's interesting. You pay, we're gone. I don't have any money. And the banknote from that guy? What! This gizmo is worth 10.000 francs? Top! Let's do another one. Sit there. Get down, you are ridiculous. You are too big. Don't move. Let's hurry, it's going to rain! Come on, the last one. Come on, run! Hurry! Do you like it? The photographer thinks you look great. It would be great for you if it worked. Why don't you redo your nose? Come, they're waiting for us. You know, I've spent the morning shopping at the Galleries. A 65 litres refrigerator costs only 5.000 francs. There is also a wonderful Japanese washing machine. But we must be reasonable. We'll wait next year to buy it. I had lunch with my mom too. I told her everything, she is very happy for us and desperate to know you. We'll dine with her tonight. You'll see, she stayed young at heart. As soon as we have our first child, we can live with her. What a joy, my Antoine. She's trying to make me jealous but she can't fool me. Do not move. It's pouring! Come on, let's pack up. Protect the equipment. This is a surprise for you. Look. That's the last straw... Well, here are my wedding presents, my little ones. And thank you for everything. You will bring your suits to the office that evening, without fail. Antoine! Antoine! There you are, it's not too early. The kitchen is over there. - I think you're mistaken, my friend. Oh, sorry, sir. The prince will soon come down, sir. It's beautiful, isn't it? Trans-Pacific 1930. 1931. Superb. I'm sorry, I arrived last. I'm expecting no one. Ah... Your reception was very successful. Really? Truly. Very nice to have met you. Excuse me but we can't hear each other. I understand your concern, but I'm not crazy. Not for a second. - I will explain to you. It's very simple, I am very rich. I bear a noble name. That's why I don't have any friends. I am alone. I'm bored since the death of my poor great-aunt. Every saturday, I have a large buffet set out. I start my tape recorder and I open the windows. You are the first... butterfly caught in my acoustic trap. It's lovely. You dance? And you? No. The women frighten me. And you prefer locomotives to them! I've been searching for the dining-car of the Transsiberian that I just saw in your window for 10 years. You're a toy train lover! Just a modest collector, nothing more. A cigar? - You smoke the same as me. Decidedly, we have the same tastes. Let's ditch these drunks. I wanted to talk to you about a project close to my heart. My dear Antoine, I think you are the man I've been looking for. This is a delicate mission. It takes skill, a strong sense of responsibilities, irreproachable moral qualities. This way. My parents. Just pretend they're not here. No, this way. You like it? - Oh, yes! I knew it! May I? - You're welcome. I'm appointing you stationmaster of my miniature network. Swell! I have other projects, the whole south network powered by catenary. 2 sugars? - Yes, thanks. You are charming. This is the tailor. 4:56 pm, 4 minutes earlier, I don't like that. Well, I'm leaving you, he will take your measures. For me? You shouldn't have. - I insist. M. Antoine, it is 6:12 am. There's your costume. Hurry, the prince is waiting for you. Travelers to Orleans, Tours, Poitiers, Angoulême, Bordeaux, your train is about to leave. All aboard, please. The way is clear. Change the signal. Change the signal, good heavens! Don't forget the switch for the 11:52 freight train. Is the sector Lorraine's crossing closed? The 96. The N73. No, my friend, no! It is 6:12 am, Mr. Antoine. The 9:52 am is late, my friend. "The cars furnish transporation for the disabled ex-servicemen" "only if they don't include a thruster at the back for the activation of the wheels." "1st, 2nd class," "Strasbourg-Mézières-Charleville." "Mézières-Charleville-Givet." Well, Givet...but I don't Give up. Antoine, you are a charming gentleman's companion. I have prepared a surprise for you. You deserve it. Ouch! Oh, shit! What is this? Now that's something else again. Oh no, it's not possible! We stopped in open country. What time is it? It is 10:31 am. What's happening? "Trains stopped. Indefinite strike." - What now? The prince is on strike in solidarity with the Union. This is the final struggle... Antoine, we will hold. Yeah, sure. Most certainly, we will hold! You're beautiful. Eighth day of the strike. What a pain! Without ordering you... Antoine! It is 11:52 pm, we go to bed? Not now. Oh, you're a bore! We go again? 4:00 am! Oh, no! After a magnificent two weeks strike, the government caved in. This is a great victory for our union demands. And now, to work. We must provide 22 extra trains for Easter holidays, ski trips, an army of skiers pouring down the railway stations. Antoine. What's wrong with you? Have you become crazy? 800 deaths. You have 800 deaths on your conscience. Wait, some are not quite dead in this car. Hi. - Hi, Chief. Nothing to report? - All is well. The 117 is in the station. It's the 6:27 am Paris-Rome? Well, yes. Hi, Chief. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Look at that! I'm in Rome! How beautiful! Sorry, I don't understand you. You're French? Let me introduce myself. I am Professor Gaetano from the school of Fine Arts. No, don't break the pose. Don't move. I was pointing out to my students the natural elegance, the sculptural beauty of your body lying down. The nobility of your facial features. Although the nose... But that does not matter. It's only a detail. No, no! Keep the pose. Forgive my boldness. I approached you to ask you a little, or better, a great service. You can answer yes or no. Would you do me the honor of posing in my studio? Where are you going? I was taking a shower. But a blow of wind closed the door so... now I look like this. I'm looking for the swimming pool. The swimming pool? Where is the swimming pool? Ah, the swimming pool! Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Good bye, sir. Good bye. A strange guy but very sympathetic. Take it. But I don't have money.... A handsome guy like you don't have to pay. Take it. Great! What do you want to drink? A coffee? Yes, please. A coffee. I am Maria. I am Antoine. Antonio. Antoine, it's cute. Why are you dressed like this? I am... a boxer. Ah, you're sporty. Sure. Very sporty. God damn, life's a bitch! My husband. - Nice. He works at night. And he sleeps all day long. Interesting...he sleeps at day and he works at night... All night long? All night long. No! Tonino! Tonino, get up! Hurry, my husband is coming! I can't get out naked. Here, take my husband's jacket. Hurry! Sorry. - You're welcome. My love. A white coffee for my little Tonino. Maria? A Martini, please. - Alright. Antonio, let me go. Here. You didn't find the swimming pool? The swimming pool? Sure, I've found it. Maria, Maria... Lawyer Di Menuti's son passed away. He was only 25. A terrible accident with a Ferrari. A 10 million Ferrari. A 10 million Ferrari? Tonino! Alive yesterday. Dead today. Poor Carlo. He was stupid. Completely stupid. Who is he? It's terrible. Alive yesterday. Dead today. Cars are very dangerous. Thanks for coming, sir. It's a sad thing. You're French, sir? Grief has no country, dear master. Carlo was more than a brother for me. You met him when he traveled to Paris? That's it. He was an highly intelligent boy. Carlo? I know what you're going to tell me, but believe me, fathers are blind. He had that modesty, that intellectual modesty that is so typical of true intelligence. How strange... I arrived this morning and I discover this city that he had so often described to me, I find your home without having ever seen it and suddenly... this nightmare! It's too unfair. Fortunately, you still have your daughters. Carlo never talked to me about you. At my express request, given the differences of fortune between us. This delicacy does you credit. What are you doing in life? My dear master, I am preparing a thesis on work. Ah, you're a communist! No, I'm not doing a thesis on working conditions but on the actual work whose principle become more and more difficult to justify. Explain yourself. It's difficult in a few words, I would like to have time to explain my ideas. Another day. We're already unemployed 132 days per year. The leisure-oriented society has invaded us. Industry itself... - Interesting. Interesting. I regret to have met you in these painful circumstances. So, Antoine, you feel better? It's good. Life must always have the upper hand. That's the way of the world. Poor Carlo. Oh... Carlo. The likeness is extraordinary. You think so? - Of course, the same piercing look, the same variety of facial expressions. Obviously, there is all the difference between the featherless baby bird and the golden eagle. A golden eagle... You know, I'm really fond of you. You're very sympathetic! Very sympathetic. All this is so trivial. You don't like it? No, sorry, it's only the emotion, the tiredness. Rest. We won't make any noise, tomorrow morning. Come on, come on, girls. Try to sleep late. Enough! Come! Bye, girls. The Italian sky. Ah, it's getting light. Come on, big girl, to work! Tonino. My God, it's so late! Silence! He's still sleeping! That boy worries me. He worked all night. I heard him come and go. All night long. Leisure time would be the new religion? Exactly. - Interesting, although a bit ironic. Ironic? We only work 140 days a year. But Antoine, he never stops. He's tireless! He works on his thesis day and night. This is your car? - Yes. So come here. Honking in Rome is forbidden! Ah... You are in violation. Your papers! It's beautiful, heh? - Yes, nice car, but I don't care. 150 horsepower. - 150 horsepower? Yes, that much. Four carburators. - Four carburators! Two twins. - Two twins! A superior model. Here, the carburators. Insufficient! It's because I've had another one installed. With a new battery. It works with a vacuum horn. What? A vacuum horn. Try it. - Me? I'll try. That's enough. Sorry. You're welcome but I'm in a hurry. Sorry. Please... Yes? Close it. Yes, sure. Great. Thanks. A moment! I'm going to stop the traffic. Hey you, come here! What's that sound! Is this your bicycle? Why did you press the bell? Didn't you see the no-honking sign? I'll have to fine you! Your papers! Horsepower? Full tank. - A little bit ahead. Good. You have a good and easy job, huh? You're kidding me. Trucks all night. I even work on Sundays. And I get up at 6:00 am every day. What are you complaining about, lazy? He's right. Lazy! I'd like to see you in my place, without a day off. Lazy! Good for nothing! Antonio! What a nice surprise! I thought you'd appreciate a visit. How thoughtful! You're so good! Giuseppe! Antoine! I'm glad you're here. You'll have lunch with us? I was about to suggest it. May I? - Yes. But you're crazy, sir! - Does it matter? Children, go play elsewhere. - Me too. Come with me, let's play the Nautilus. You will be the submarine's captain. And you, the cabin boy. I want to be captain. - No, it's me! If you see an enemy ship, you fire your torpedoes! - Yes, yes. You'd make a wonderful father. Isn't it? My name is Antoine, and you? What are you doing? As you can see, we are alone, as at the dawn of humanity. The male roams the desert areas, with the dark desire to perpetuate the species. - Stop or I scream! It's time when dinosaurs drink. Don't hurt me, please! If you're not interested, I'll drop it. I did that to please you. Women are so complicated. Maybe I must tell you that your eyes are like deep lakes and your mouth like a ripe raspberry? It's always the same. My name is Clara. - Ah? Excuse me, I took you for a sadist. Naughty girl! What punctuality! Here I am! Start without me, I'm changing and I'll be right back. You're welcome, we have all the time. I'm worried. He doesn't look well, don't you think? On the contrary. He's so changed. He's superb. He is so strong. He is so cute. Perhaps, but it doesn't mean anything, on the contrary. I've known many seriously ill persons who looked radiant with health, who ate like ogres. It's better this way, right? I wish I had a son like you. Since you are here, I don't know... Did you work hard today? Work? I thought, I dreamed, I imagined, I extrapolated, I speculated, I solved... or rather, I tried to solve. You see what I mean. What a tremendous amount of work! Antoine, my son... Yes, yes. My son. Let me warn you. You're overworked. Let's speak frankly. I know for a while now how your situation at my home can be unpleasant. Well, you know... - I mean it, Antoine. I appreciates your delicacy. But I think I cannot further abuse of your kindness. So here is the good news. I spoke about you to the rector of the university. He is very interested in your thesis and wants you as a secretary. You have an appointment with him tomorrow at 5:00 pm. Aren't you happy? Well, I don't know what to say. The idea of working... No, no, do not thank me. You're offering me not only a career, but also happiness. I will finally be able to... get married! But I didn't know. Without a good job, it was difficult for me to ask you the hand of your daughter. My daughter? But... Which one? Well, that's the problem... Which one? What do you mean? Let's talk between men. My overwork, my fatigue, the noises you hear at night... Well, that is... You don't mean... - Yes. Antoine, I command you to tell me which one could... Oh, but... all of them. All my girls! You mean with all my girls? - I didn't want to create jalousy and they are all so charming. How passionate they are! - Sir! You speak of my daughters! Who else? - But they're all underage! This is so much better. Get out of here! Antoine! Ciao, ciao! Thank you, your Highness. Excuse me, Sir... Your Highness. Any bounds on 200 pounds? Going, going, gone! To Mr Genevissi for 200 pounds. Next piece, please. This portrait of Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 1480 and was refused by the client. It's a very rare work: The sad Mona Lisa.

Any advance on 2 millions? Going, going, gone! What's the matter? - To Mr. Alexandre Darius Socratos for 2 million pounds. What's the matter? What, what, what? - Nothing. Oh, you got me good. - Is it any wonder? Learn, young man, that nothing resists Alexander Darius Socratos. However I enjoyed crushing you. Who's that? - Who are you? Excuse me. Mirliflore. Antoine. Mirliflore, Antoine? - I don't know him. Sankhapur, do you know this fellow, Antoine Mirliflore? Don't try. I don't belong to your world. I belong to no one, and nothing belongs to me. So where does your fortune come from? My fortune? What fortune? Come on, stop this game, please! You won't have me believing that, without any fortune, you tried to contest me this painting? Yes, without fortune would be an exaggeration. Let's say... without a penny. You provoke me! I wouldn't think of it. Where is the difference? With or without a penny, you enjoyed crushing me. I'm very glad you did. Isn't that the point? - What a crook! So you're a crook! At last, a worthy opponent! What nerve. What audacity! You remind me of someone I loved very much. Really? Who? - Myself. That's very funny. I was also juggling with imaginary millions like you. For me, all millions are imaginary. Exactly. Those who understand that really have the genius of money. I'm going to Paris. Come with me, we will talk. To the airport. We are of the same race, my dear Antoine. Life is a fight. Struggle for life. I started by selling newspapers. I, Alexandre Darius Socratos. In 10 years, I had the Rolls, the yacht, the Chinese valet. You're only starting, my dear Antoine. But I see in you a futur major financier. A very big financier. By pretending to be a rich man, you probably had an idea in mind. No, not a single one. I don't know what prompted me. An infallible instinct. You are predestined. - He is predestined. Go ahead boldly and money will fall into your hands. Moreover, I'm going to give you loans. Believe me, your fortune is made. That's it, it starts again. Well, thank you for everything. Very nice to have met you. You are charming. Yes, yes, charming. Where is he going? - Where are you going? Believe me, your financial success would be complete. New York. Financial success? You're completely out of line, my poor Alexandre Darius Socratos. Call me ADS. - ADS. New York. Financial, financial... Do I look like a financial success? Look at me. The more I look at you... Mark my words once and for all. I don't give a damn about working. I don't understand you anymore. You're without fortune and you don't give a damn about working. New York. - Kick him out. He's fired. How do you live? The great art in life is to accept your fate. You find enough fools to maintain you? - Oh, yes! He's so funny! Come for the weekend in our home in Sologne. You will explain us everything. Wait, wait. The great art in life... - ...is to accept your fate. Be quiet! You should write a book on the subject. With this title: "Doing nothing". Followed by 200 blank pages. What was your purpose when writing this book? It's alright. I understand you. When you say you are lazy, you really talk about a fixed determination to do nothing? A perpetual desire. A passion. Well, ADS, why the long face? You're in trouble? I wonder, when I look at you, if my life was not a huge mistake. I suddenly feel... How do you say? - Small, shabby? Non. - A total ass? Yes. - Yes, I see. You have to change your outlook on life. You know the subway? - No. So, you're having fun? Antoine, believe me, I am unworthy of your friendship. Leave me alone. - No, I won't let you. Waiter! So, we're done with that great sorrow? My kitty. You are good. Thank you. You are too good. Here, pay the bill, my dear. I'm offering you this painting. Only you deserve it. Talk about a gift, this granny! He's right again. I'm only good at buying a 2 billion granny. Yes, of course, two billion is a sum. Antoine, I beg you, help me. What would you do with it? I don't know. I would give it to my workers. Awesome! This painting will change your life. Wage rises, premiums, paid holiday, all this is over. Access to artworks, that's the key. My dear comrades, you will all become collectors, and billionaires, through your boss. Let me greet the promoter of this magnificent initiative, Antoine Mirliflore. You're coming, Isabelle? - Yes. Antoine, my boy, we're leaving. Can I walk with you? - Yes. You live far away? - There, on the outskirts of Argenteuil. What? I'm not going to walk all of that way. Get on the luggage rack. You're not going to pedal? - Why not? It goes against your principles. It's there. That's it. So goodbye, Isabelle. Won't you come in? - I don't want to disturb. My parents won't eat you. They're very nice. Your parents are there... - Hello, Isabelle. Good evening mother. - Sir. Don't you recognize him? It's Mr. Antoine Mirliflore. M. Mirliflore ? That guy from the TV? Oh, but then come in. Oh, yes! My husband will be so happy. He always tells me: "This Mirliflore is not a..." Well, he's someone. Say, Julien. - Huh? Guess who's here. - I don't give a damn. But look! It's Mr. Antoine Mirliflore. What? It's him. - Oh, my! Mr. Mirliflore. - Yes, Mr. Mirliflore. Excuse my attire. What do we owe the honor to? M. Mirliflore brought me home. Huh? Mr. Mirliflore brought Isabelle home. Yes, I got that, he brought her home. That's it. Let's drink to it! - Yes, good idea. How much do I owe you, Léon? A round of drinks each, 8,50 F each. It's too silly, but I... I forgot my wallet. Don't worry. You will pay next time. We know your theories. Money, it comes and goes. Right? I am mortified. James, you wouldn't have 8.50 F to lend me? I am sorry, sir. I only have dollars. To the factory! How much will you give me for this? Well... 8,50 F. - Perfect. Here I am, sailors! And this time...the round's on me! The last one. Then we get some chow. More chocolate cream? - No thanks. You're a wonderful cook. It's not me. It's Isabelle who made it. Congratulations. You'll see, her pike with white butter sauce... Among others... - Can I help you? Come on, are you kidding? Let them alone. Don't you want to go to the living-room? We thought a nap will do you some good. It's very kind of you but I'm not sleepy. I'm the boss here. We appreciate your coming here on a Sunday. We have time, we can chat. Sure. - Two sugars? Yes. No, one is enough. A little drop? - Yep. The weeknights, after work, I'm exhausted and I'm not good at making conversation. Of course, I understand. You know what it is. In the end, this is your problem too. Maybe you want to talk about something else. You really don't want to take a nap? No thanks, I am not tired at all. Oh, France-Bulgaria! - Wait till I sit comfortably. You don't mind? Not at all, do not change anything in your habits for me. If sport doesn't interest you, you can go for a walk with Isabelle. Who is it? Mr. Antoine Mirliflore. He who does nothing? - Yes, Madam. It's funny that you're here. Really? Why? For a man like you, we're not very interesting people. A man like me... I'm not the Shah of Persia. For my parents, you are the Shah of Persia. You can't imagine their joy, their pride. Everyone knows. - It is rather nice. Oh yes, of course. They are very kind, but sometimes they annoy me a little. For example, when they boast about your housewife qualities? For example. I don't like when they do their sales spiel. They are proud of their daughter. And they are right. They'll be very disappointed when you don't come anymore. But, Isabelle... Be sincere. You're not going to spend all your Sundays at Argenteuil between mom and dad. You see. There are not only your parents, in Argenteuil. Me? It's cruel, what you do here. I don't care about the disappointment of my parents. You know it. But I was living happily. I didn't need the Shah of Persia. You are right. Maybe it's better if I go. Oh, no! Now that you're here. How about a dance? - Oh yes. Antoine. I think I love you. Ah, here he comes! Where were you, little sneak? You have disappeared after the inauguration. It seems that you were looking everywhere for 8,50 F. You see, you need money. Yes. But it was the first time. You have found it, I hope. Yes - Oh, I wasn't worried for you. Well... You don't seem very eager to talk. No. Of course, you learned the news. What news? He didn't learn the news! You're a poet! The sad Joconde has disappeared. The sad Joconde has been stolen. That's what makes you so happy? Dear Antoine, this is the best deal of my life. I had insured it three billion. But you paid it only two. Exactly! Well, gosh! Let's drink to it! We must celebrate. To celebrate? But this is what we do! You call this a party? You don't know nothing. You all look like freezed penguins! Take off your jackets, your pants, your shoes. We are at the court of the Shah of Persia. And I am the Shah of Persia! Bravo! You are on top form. - Top form. Hey, that's too much! The insurance will pay. He is right. - He is right. He's always right. - He's always right. There are limits, dear friend. I am not your dear friend. Wait, wait. Look at him! You've always made me laugh. Antoine... That's it. I'm coming to ask the hand of your daughter. Antoine! They lived happily and... Stop! Antoine, Antoine. Dad, you didn't say goodbye. See you tonight, darling. Work hard. Come on. Antoine, my boy. You had a bad dream? A nightmare. Nanny, I dreamed I was working. My poor little. translation: aloysius70
