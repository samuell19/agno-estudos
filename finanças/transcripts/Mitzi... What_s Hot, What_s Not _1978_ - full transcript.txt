(audience laughing) ("Hot Time" continues) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) ("Hot Time" continues) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) Hi, hot is back, and the newest thing you can say is, (clicks tongue) it's hot, which means, well, it means what it always meant. You remember hotter than a pistol and hot stuff and hotsy-totsy? Well, we here at hot central have surveyed news editors all over the country to find out what's the hottest, what's the latest, and what's the most up-to-datest, eh, uh? (audience laughs) Now, here's what's hot in politics. Sadat's hot. And in fashion, Halston's hot. And in sports, it's jogging. Seems like everyone's hot to trot. (audience laughs) (clears throat) In posters, Farrah is still the hot Fawcett. (audience laughing) You know what the hottest dog is? It's the French poodle, but cats are even hotter than dogs, and hot dogs aren't that hot, hamburgers are. (audience laughs) But in foods, the absolute hottest is frozen yogurt. (audience laughs) Now, let me think. What else made the hot parade? Ah, yeah, there's a men's full-length minks, high-protein drinks, and Leon Spinks. And what's this? (audience laughs) Just happens to be the hottest pair of knees on television. - Mitzi? - Hmm? - Can I ask you a hot question? - Let it happen, Cap'n. Well, when is the rest of me gonna be on the show? - Soon, Gavin. - Good, I'll go warm everything up. (audience laughing) - Let's see, what else is hot? Uh. (panting) Lance. - Mitzi. - Oh, John, you're so young and so restless. - I know, I know. Mitzi, it's really a pleasure being on your show. - Oh, well, John, you know, soaps are hot, and besides, I had to see you. - Meaning? - Well, it's been bothering me that even though you're happily married to Lorie, now your sister-in-law Leslie has fallen madly in love with you, too. - I know, I know. I've done a lotta thinking about that myself, and actually, there's only one explanation for that. - What is it, John? - When you're hot, you're hot. - You're so (laughs), oh, John, please don't joke with me.

We finally figured it out, right, girls? A menu weighs a lot less than a double boiler. (audience laughs) That's James Joseph Murphy. He's not an actor, honest. He the proprietor and maitre d' of one of the hottest new restaurants in Beverly Hills, a humble little million-dollar cafe called Jimmy's. (whimsical music) - Oh, Jerome, everything is so expensive! - (chuckles) Well, of course it's expensive, Emily.

We cater to the gourmets. (audience laughs) - The Gormes? Steve and Eydie? I wonder if they're here tonight. (audience laughs) - Now, look, look. I am not exactly a gourmet. I'm more of a Quarter Pounder person. (audience laughs) - Here's something we could split! - Ooh, you wanna split something? Sure. - The chateaubriand for two. - That's 34 bucks. - That's sorta like a, um, a steak, isn't it? - Exactly, it's the best one we've got. - I do just fine with French menus. You just gotta plunge right in there, Jerome. - Oh, yeah. - I think I'll have the salad mason. - Salad maison? The house salad, yes? - And les goomies.

Oh, hurry, please! - No! Oh! - Oh, oh, now listen, don't you worry, Jerome. Oh, Jerome, don't you worry! Everything is gonna be all right. Oh, darn it. I forgot to order dessert. (audience laughs) (head thuds) (whimsical music) (calm orchestral music) (Mitzi clears throat) (light orchestral music) The dance is hot and always has been. From the dawn of civilization, dance has been hotly controversial. Take the early Greeks, please. (laughs) (audience laughs) They were famous for a dance done with complete abandon that paid tribute to the lusty fertility of the grape. (audience laughs) (whimsical music) (audience laughs) (whimsical music continues) (audience laughs) (audience laughs) (audience applauding) (audience laughs) (audience applauding) (calm orchestral music) (clears throat) Yes, well, dance moved from Greece, and one can plainly see why. It then hopped and skipped across the centuries until it became the rage of the French court during the reign of King, um, King, well, (chuckles) one of those Louis, yes. (audience laughs) (regal minuet music) (pannier thuds) (audience laughs) (pannier thuds) (audience laughs) (head clangs) (audience laughs) (audience applauding) (calm orchestral music) (clears throat) Then one steamy summer night in Vienna, a dance was introduced so scandalous men dueled at the mere mention of it, so I shan't mention it. (chuckles) Suffice it to say, ladies were touched at the waist for the first time. Ah, need I say more, ladies? (audience laughs) (fanciful music) (audience laughs) (light-hearted waltz music) (audience applauding) (audience laughs) (audience applauding) (audience laughing) Next, it was America's turn to be shocking with a dance so hot those who dared it were branded flaming youth. What's a mother to do?
