Tops ma, tops. What's? Dad have you ever watched a Bollywood movie? No, never. Who's been telling you about Bollywood? No, no one I read it in the news paper. Apparently they're very interesting films. Far from true Harold. That stuff will turn your brains into candy floss. We don't want that now do we? No. The good news is you're in but the cartel doesn't wanna deal with small fry. They wanna make sure you can move quantity. They want you to move this. That's 200 k's worth of white. My man I'm the main man in these parts. Where to? Mbabane and it's dangerous. There's a good chance you're delivery guy's gonna get caught either by the cops or a rival gang if he's not careful. No worries, we know just the guy for the job. What if he fails? Worst case scenario, I pay the 200,000. It's my head on the block and yours Raj. You don't wanna mess with these people. Easy peasy my man, relax, don't worry my man Reggie is desperate enough for this job. Be cool, unless you wanna be six feet under. That lousy piece of shit, I'll cut him, I'll poke him. Who does he think he is, he's putting Reggie in danger. Maybe this is going to be easy, now there's evidence the police just need to find it. Let's finish this quick, we've got some serious business to handle now. What's this thing? Typewriter, we can use it to type a letter to the police chief. I knew you had some brains. My dad used to write stories for the newspaper about crazy people and criminals. But now he only writes about dead people. Why? Dead people don't read papers Okay what should it say? Veerasamy, listen here. There's a bad crook name Raja, lock him up. Station commander. Harold, who were you talking to. No one, myself. What are you doing with they typewriter? Practicing. Okay. Ticky. Mrs. Pillay did you put this letter on my desk? That's 1,000. Why now? How you bro. Like I'm up to something and all? Who looked after you since the accident? You was a cripple, no one could hire you. What you want for this kindness? Kindness. Yeah that's more like it. Have an important delivery for you to make. For that. You get this 1,000. Come back safely I'll give you another four clips. How does that sound? You will never catch me. What's this? Where's the owner of this night club? Raja you have some visitors. The commander gonna. Chief. Hey Raj. Hi man I just came to check on the preparation for the wedding reception. We all set here, we had the place spring cleaned and everything. See you using child labor hey? More like baby sitting. Listen the wife and some ladies are going to come later to check up on the decorations and all that. No hassle. Bro, come here. You got to be careful, I found this on my desk this morning. You can't expect me to turn a blind eye with things like this lying around. Find the leak, plug it. No worries. No one messes with me. It can only be one of two people. Change of plans. Someone told the pigs about the merchandise, move it somewhere else. Sure boss. He knows it's us, he looked straight at me. If he thought it was us we'd be sleeping with the crocodiles. He looked at me because he thinks it's Reggie. We need to warn him now. Okay, okay, okay. Here, have some. Hey Ticky, come have some cake. What's going on? Why didn't Raja you? What? He thinks you ratted him out to the police right? Hey wait now, how you knew that? If you were at the club you would know. Hey, what you were doing there? Trying to earn some money for the family, only difference is my money comes home. That's no place of. Why're you doing a dirty dogs business? Why you got so much money here? Why you can't even see that he's setting you up. I'm a child and I can see that. Don't do the delivery for him Reggie, don't do it. What's he saying Reg? What's Ticky talking about? Hey never mind, here take her. What do we do now? What is it Harold? Have a grown another head? When will you be able to write real stores again, not just about dead people? I'm new there Harold, I can't really be sticking my neck out. Besides people who die are owed the respect of a proper tribute. It's an important job. Yes but you said criminals should be taken off the street and be locked up. If you knew about one, could you write a story? Has that thug and his goon been coming around here while I'm at work? No. Good, that would be terrible. Yes but wouldn't you like to see someone like him in jail? Writing the obituaries suits me right now. Ever since your mom. We've had enough change for now. My dads here, it's his day off. We have to go to the club, it's now or never. I can't today. We'll be back before he even notices you're gone. Besides he's asleep. There's Size. Come my friend. What are we doing here? What's the plan? Let's see first. Size has gone inside now. Those two people, look dancers. Hey how's it going? Wedding we have here. Hey top outfits man. Come let's go in. You know me Raj, I swear I'm a man of my word. Take this out back and teach him a lesson. Okay, come on. What the, Raja think about it, why would I rat you out? My life is at stake here. You weren't trying to set me up? This couldn't be me, I don't even own a typewriter. If it's not Reggie and it's not you, then who is it? You're not trying to get out of the deal are you? That would be a bad thing, that would be a very bad thing. Shut up. Where's the contact details? You have to move the product tonight otherwise you're gonna miss the deadline. Get Reggie. After this circus is done he can get going. Reggie can't go. Why don't we destroy the drugs, no drugs no delivery. But it also means no evidence. Raja won't go to jail and you won't get your bike back. You're dads life more important than my bike. Serious? Okay, we need to get into Raja's office. How will we, remember it's locked? Hey. Harold. Harold? Hells there's the devil Leila. Let's. There you are, there you are. Hey time to go onto the stage, the guests need some entertainment. Sorry commander, my stomach, I must go to the toilet.

You're hero lessons are stupid like you, and now they're gonna get me killed to. Raja saw me, he saw my face. You and your stupid Bollywood heroes, they're just people pretending to be heroes. This is real life, not Bollywood. Harold are you okay? I'm fine. Don't worry dad, I'm never gonna see Ticky again. You were right about everything. You wanna tell me what happened? Not today. Dad?
