Africa again? Kate. You scared me. You know, you do that a lot. Well, occupational hazard. We work at a travel magazine and we're stuck in these tiny little cubicles. I mean, come on, can't you picture it? Me, in a safari hat, one of those cute little vests, and those amazing knee-high boots, just hanging with the elephants. Mm, if only in your dreams. Well, at least I can dream, can't I? Do you really want to quit your job? No-- well, no. But I am planning my escape from this copy editing desk. I am a writer, remember? At least you're editing the "World's Best" articles. Could be worse. Could be me. Apparently, this was also a landfill. Plastic is single-handedly destroying our planet. Okay. Everybody, gather around. So, it's been a great quarter, and that is thanks, in large part, to the incredible hard work and dedication of you fine people. But... as the magazine grows, so does our audience. Which is why, this year... Around the World Travel is looking to expand our travel writing team. We're hoping to find a fresh voice, a new perspective, so I am accepting story pitches from anyone on staff. Now... here's the exciting part. Whoever writes the best travel article wins a first-class ticket to anywhere in the world... [gasping collectively] ...And the cover story in our next issue, as well as an ongoing position as a staff travel writer. Deadline is a week from Monday. Here's your chance. Get in there! Oh, Kate, the last time I pitched a story to McHugh, he gave me the old "That's not quite right for us, Alex," and sent me back to my desk. That was then! You heard him, they're looking for a new writer. Second chances. Alex, go, go, go! You really think so? Yeah. Whew. Okay. Mr. McHugh? Sir? Do you have a moment? Walk with me, Alex. I just think it's such a great idea, what you're doing, about the contest. Thank you. Is that all? Uh, n-no. I would love to enter it. As a writer. Great. What'd you have in mind? In mind? Uh... well-- Off the top of my head, I could, uh... I could write about this romantic New England B&B that I went to recently, that is classic and decadent, and, um... did I mention romantic? It's nice to see you taking initiative, Alex, and you're a very valuable asset to our copy editing team, but travel writers, they go off the beaten path, they come outside of their comfort zone. You really think that's you? Yes, sir. I mean, pretty much... ...ish? Travel writers are courageous, Alex, they'll try anything. Each story reveals a part of their soul, taking the reader on an inner- and outer-journey. So.... not a romantic B&B then? Think bigger. [mutters]: "Bigger." [sighing] [♪♪♪] There you two are! Join us. We have been summoned. Mother, you look lovely. Oh, thank you, dear. Alex, so nice to see you. Nice to see you, too, Mrs. Kane, Mr. Kane. Thank you so much for having me. Of course. I always say, call me "Bitty". Right. Sorry. Bitty. As I was saying... the Raven's House is looking to expand its charity program this year. And, between that and the Kanes' Foundation, we've raised nearly $2 million for "Paws for Peace." Wonderful! Alex, you should really volunteer with us. You've been such a big help in the past. You know I'd love to, Bitty, thank you so much for asking, but there's actually this opportunity coming up at work. My editor at Around The World Travel magazine announced this contest today. They're looking for a new travel writer. A contest? To travel? As a job? Yeah. I mean, I still have to apply and everything, and who knows if I even stand a chance, but I mean, traveling the world as a writer, inspiring people through my words, it's... it's a dream job. Well, apply you should. [Mr. Kane]: Yes. Well... this might be a good time to make your announcement, Barton. What? [Mr. Kane]: May I have everyone's attention? I've been wanting to create more stability in my life, Move things to the next level. [Mr. Kane]: I'm thrilled to announce... Barton has been promoted to partner. [gasping and applauding] Thank you. Thank you, all. That's just so... Amazing. Right? ...Amazing, yes. [stammers] Congratulations. I knew you'd be thrilled. You deserve it. Hey, Kate? What is this called? What are we looking at? That, there. Mm. I don't know. Exhilaration? Yes! That's it! Thank you. I don't have that. Has my life become complacent? Uh, I wouldn't say complacent. It's more like stable and predictable. Are these the shots for the new "World's Best" article? [Alex]: Mm-hmm. I love the photographer. He captures something. This-- This feeling. I can't really explain it. Who is he? Is he handsome? The only thing I know about Cole Taylor is that he lives in Ridgeline Resort in Colorado. He must have a Facebook account. No. I checked. He has a website, but other than that, no online presence, no photos, nothing. Sounds like a real recluse. You know, I bet he has a wilderness beard. All enigmas have beards. [laughs] So someone's a recluse just because they don't have a social media profile? Pretty much. Oh, it's 3:00 p.m. Shall we? We shall. [♪♪♪] Oh, hey, Cole. What are you doing? Uh, we need to change things up a little, for your Winter Walk meet-and-greet. What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no. We agreed-- I'm the silent partner. You do the talking and the selling. There will be no "meet" or "greet". Cole, I haven't sold anything in weeks, and people are requesting new pieces, which is you. With all the commercial work, I haven't had time. Fair enough, but we can't keep working on the same old material. What happened to the guy who needed to "capture a moment in time"? Capturing a moment in time is not just about a beautiful photo, Max. You gotta be inspired, you can't just force inspiration. Anyway... How does it happen so fast? One minute, you're reaching for your dreams, and the next, you're 29 and coasting, everything is easy and safe, and the most exciting part of your day is getting lattes at 3:00 p.m. I mean, don't get me wrong, I have a great job. but I majored in journalism in college. When did I become a bystander in my own life? Well, that's just who you are. You're not a risk-taker, and that's okay. Hey! I got double whip on my latte today. Yeah, first time ever. It's true. You know... ever since I fell down the stairs when I was four years old, my mom's had me in hypothetical bubble wrap. I'm a low-risk dreamer with nothing to show for it. No wonder Barton has zero faith in me. Hey, entering that contest isn't safe. Okay? It takes real guts. If I can figure out what to write about. I don't know how I'm gonna get McHugh to take me seriously as a travel writer. Oh, hey, look. That's Cole Taylor's photo. For an enigma, he sure is everywhere. At least his photos are. Maybe they're trying to tell me something. To go skiing? I doubt it. No, Kate! That's it! I know what I'm gonna write about. McHugh is going to love it! Alex! Wait! It's not a good idea to run with coffee! What can I do for you, Alex? Well, sir, I thought a lot about what you said, and I am proposing that I travel to the wilds of the Rocky Mountains and write an article on nature and extreme sports photographer Cole Taylor. His work is amazing. Oh... There we go. His work is amazing. They call him the next Ansel Adams, yet he hasn't created a new collection in two years. He really is quite the mystery. Perfect subject, right? Well, I mean, the photos are wonderful, but if he's so elusive, how are you gonna find him? He lives at Ridgeline Resort in Colorado. I was thinking I could go undercover. You, in the world of extreme sports? Alex, and I mean this with all the kindness in the world, but you're a complete klutz. No, I'm not! Coffee. Well, maybe just a little bit, but that has nothing to do with my ability to write. Actually... this is a great idea. Thank you. You should write it in first person from the prospective of a non-adventurer, and in one week, you try every extreme sport that they have there. I'm sorry, what? Well, you wanted a story. Right? Well, this is it. But what about Cole Taylor, sir? You're a travel writer, not an investigative journalist. This story should be about you. The deadline is a week from Monday. You'd better get going. That is a-- that is a great idea. Thank you. Mr. McHugh. You will not regret this. Extreme sports? Alex, do you even know what that means? No, but I am an excellent researcher. Pretty sure that's not the same thing. But I believe in you. Thank you. Mr. McHugh thinks it's gonna be great Now I have the entire flight to Denver to become an expert on all things extreme. Uh, can you... can you cover for me on "World's Best" while I'm away? Yes! I'm no longer the "World's Worst"! Oh, and Alex? Be a warrior, not a worrier. Right. [Kate]: I'm heading to the airport now. You're actually doing this? Yep! The deadline is next Monday, so that gives me seven days to face my fears and-- and write this story. I thought we'd go away this weekend. You and me, the Berkshires? Barton, you're not making this any easier. No, I-I need to do this. For myself, for my career, for us. It's my big chance. I finally get to step outside of my comfort zone. Okay. One week, you'll be back? Then I'm back. All right. Knock 'em dead, babe. Maybe we don't mention death when I'm about to go do extreme sports? Right, sorry. Just please be safe. Safe, I will be. I hope. [♪♪♪] [quietly, to self]: "I'm a warrior, not a worrier." [thudding and banging] What was that? [sighs irately] My mechanic thinks it's the axle. Now, the tow truck driver's swamped, but he should be here in a few hours. A few hours? Sorry, miss, but, luckily, if you're in a hurry, the resort is just a mile up the road. [resigned sigh] "Don't be complacent," they said. "Go on an adventure," they said. [cell rings] Hi, Kate. Yeah, I'm here. Okay, good. Just checking. Yup. But I'm on foot. I don't understand. Are you on the highway? Kate, I think there's a man following me. Did you say "a van"? A mountain man in a Jeep. I gotta go, okay? I gotta go. He's gonna kidnap me, he's gonna throw my bag in the bushes, and no one's ever gonna be able to find me. Excuse me, ma'am? Need a ride? I'm good, thanks! I'm going the same way. [scoffs] Why not? Just get into a Jeep with a complete stranger. You sure? 'Cause that bag looks heavy. It's good for the cardio. Okay, suit yourself. Good luck with the bears. Bears? Welcome to Ridgeline Resort. How may I help you? Hi. Checking in. Alex Burns. Yes. I see we have you in the "Idyllic Suite" with a mountain view. [sighs] Sounds idyllic. You came at the perfect time, too. "Winter Walk" starts in a few days. Winter Walk? Local artists open their shops with hot drinks and treats. It's a great way to connect with the community, raise money for charity, and celebrate Ridgeline artists. Artists, like... Cole Taylor? Exactly. Cole sells his work out of the Ridgeline Art Gallery. Huh. I, uh... I thought that he was a recluse. Not really. In fact, with this fresh snow, I'm sure you'll see Cole up on the mountain. Here's your key. You'll want to head out the front door, and head north, up the path. Can I just leave my luggage with the bellman? Unfortunately, we don't have one. But it's just a short jaunt up the nature path. Enjoy your stay. Okay. Great. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [wheezing] "The serene nature path up to my cabin welcomed me." [exhales] [phone rings] Hello? Alex, how're the slopes? Mr. McHugh! Hi, sir. Yes, uh... Good. It's funny that you should call right now. I'm actually just about to head out on my first excursion. Excellent. Have fun out there. Just the word I was gonna use. [♪♪♪] [Sarah]: Well, our "Weekend Warrior" package includes zip-lining, heli-skiing, and bungee jumping. The views from 3,000 feet are spectacular. Ow! Uh, may I help you find something? Uh, no. No, I, um... I'm just browsing. Let me know if you guys have questions, all right? Our mountain biking trails are suitable for all levels. Our next excursion starts in 30 minutes. Oh, hi! Hi, hi. Yeah. The, uh, the mountain biking that's suitable for all levels-- where do I sign up for that? Oh, just fill this out. Okay. Do you prefer suspension, comfort, or fat bike? Let's just go with the fat bike. It has the best grip in the snow. Great. Thank you. I'm Alex, by the way. Sarah. See you on the chairlift. The chairlift? Hey! Is that your jacket? Don't worry. You'll warm up once you get moving. Oh, I'm not worried... about that. [lift buzzer blares] There's a seatbelt, right? Your bike will be on the next chair. But is there a seatbelt? On the lift? See you up there! Okay. Ohh... Ohh. That's so high up. I ca-- I can't-- I can't do this! Oh, no, it's too high-- Sorry, I-- I ca-- I can't-- [yelps] Miss! Please remove yourself. Would you like some help, ma'am? You? Why not? Let's get outta here. [Alex]: Thank you for, uh, you know, helping me back there, but I'm pretty sure I can get myself back to the hotel okay. And let you cause another human pile-up? [chuckles] Not a chance. Okay, so I'm not the best biker. Whoops. More like a chairlift-mounter. You haven't gotten on your bike yet. Right. Oh. I can do that. Okay, it's, uh... I think my bike is broken. No, you just need to shift the gears down. This thing? Right. Okay. Whoa-whoa-ah! [yelps] I just remembered why I don't ride bikes in Central Park. New York, huh? Yeah. What're you doing here? Oh, that's a long story. Whatever it is, you may want to think about rewriting it. [chuckles] Right. Have a good day! You too. It sure can't get much worse. [guy]: Hey, Cole! [Cole]: Hey! Cole Taylor? [♪♪♪] Alex! You're here! I was about to send out a search party. I know, I know, I'm so sorry. I guess I wasn't ready for the chairlift, or... anything, really. It's your first time! You'll get the hang of it. You didn't see me out there. What if you got yourself a guide? Maybe. Do-- Do you know anyone? Well... most guides I know are booked up with Winter Walk this week. I'm helping the organizer, but I mean, I could-- No, no, it's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. Right now, I just really need a hot bath. [sighs] Thanks, Sarah. I'll see you later. Okay. Take care. [♪♪♪] My advice? Stay clear of the chairlift for a while. What happened? Ah, the equivalent of a human pile-up. Oh, now I know you're exaggerating. Maybe, but that's just because you didn't meet her. "Her"? Yeah. A walking catastrophe. [phone ringing] Hey. Are you okay? What happened? Oh, nothing. I'm fine. I just, uh... I went fat biking. Is that like a new spin class? No, it's-- it's a bike... on a mountain. Mountain! [chuckles] Oh, look at you, babe. Hmph. Oh. I totally humiliated myself. Are you okay? Yeah. I think. I don't know. Well, if you change your mind, don't feel bad. [crackling] ...Been the sporty type. I'm losing you, Barton. I-- There's abso-- [crackles] ...shame in coming home-- ...boyfriend. Home? No. No, I'm gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be great. It is just-- [service failure chimes] Delightful. [mutters to self]: Here goes nothing. "Warrior." [♪♪♪] [Max]: Beautiful, aren't they? Just gorgeous. I've actually been following Cole Taylor's work for a while. I was hoping maybe I could speak with him, if he's here? [♪♪♪] Hey. New York? You two know each other? Not exactly. I realize I didn't really give the best first impression. That's an understatement. Right. But I didn't know it was you, then, and I'm actually a really big fan of your work. I'm Alex Burns. Cole Taylor. You're the cause of the pile-up? You told him about that? Yes. Safety precaution. Well, you're right. I'm pretty much terrible at every outdoor activity, but I came to Ridgeline to face my fears, and it's pretty clear that I can't really do it on my own. I know that you're not a guide, but you seem pretty great at everything that you do, and there is no one else available. Wow. I'm flattered. No! I'm so sorry. I didn't-- I didn't mean it like that. I'm a copy editor, and I just got my first real travel writing assignment, which means I can't mess it up. The problem is that I'm supposed to write this article about me doing extreme sports, and I'm basically afraid of everything, and probably the worst person for the job, but my editor seems to think that it is a brilliant idea. It could be really funny. Look. This is-- This is my one shot. If I don't do this right, it'll ruin my career. Please, Cole... would you please help me? Sorry, Alex, we're really busy. Right. I understand. We're not that busy. What? I have an honest face. I can't lie. And you picked the right guy. I mean, Cole is great at everything, and I'm not just saying that because I run his gallery. What about the Winter Walk we're trying to organize? Uh, "we"? I thought I was organizing. What about the meet-and-greet? You said you weren't doing that. I could help! With Winter Walk, or-or the meet-and-greet, or whatever is needed, I-- and you could help me with extreme sports. It's a win-win! Please? All right. But I'm giving you one day to prove to me that you're not gonna kill us both, and you play by my rules. Got it? Got it! Where are you staying? Ridgeline Resort? Mm-hmm. Meet me at 9:00 a.m. at the activity center. 9:00 a.m., activity center. Got it. Come prepared to work. Will do. Thank you so much! [alarm beeping] [writing]: "Day two of my extreme adventure, and I've already made one friend." "Okay, almost one friend. "But I have found a guide "into the world of extreme sports, "which means things are looking up. "I'm curious to see what he has in store for us today. "Hopefully nothing too extreme. "I'm feeling a bit like the local deer... just as skittish." Good morning. Good morning. Wow. Perfect timing. I just checked. The chopper's leaving in 20 minutes. A helicopter? Yeah. There's a giant ice cliff nearby. You've gone ice-climbing before, right? Ice-climbing? While we're up there, we're gonna paraglide off the cliff. Paragliding? Mm-hmm. Uh... that all sounds really fun, but, um-- I just remembered that I have a, um, I have a phone call-- Oh, you should see the look on your face. -You're joking? -Yes, I'm joking. This whole thing is all a joke? This is a joke, yes. It's pretty funny, right? You have a weird sense of humor. And you have to lighten up. Let's go. I promise, no chopper. [Alex]: A climbing gym? Would you rather go ice-climbing? I can call the chopper. No, no! It's fine. It's just that, uh... This is like a jungle gym for kids. I'm not really a kid. We're all kids at heart. Plus, we need to shake some of the city off of you, and it'll help you with your fear of heights. I'm not afraid of heights. [thud] [gasps] I mean... Maybe a little bit. So, what kind of shoes did you bring? Just my running shoes. -Those are your running shoes? -Yeah! Do they even offer you support? No, but they look really cute with my outfit. [laughs] No. See, the problem is, you don't have the right gear. No offense, but this isn't really my style, it's, uh... very orange. Oh. Right. Excuse me? We need some help here. Yeah, we need to fix this. All the basics. Top to bottom. Please. And shoes, please. Sure thing. So... Who's the guy? Guy--? What guy? What're you talking about? Come on. There's gotta be a reason why you're doing this-- humiliating yourself. I mean... besides the work thing. No offense, but you're not the sporty type. I will have you know, that I was "Sporty Spice" one year for Halloween. Okay, actually, I was "Posh Spice". My boyfriend, Barton, is very sweet and very supportive of me. Your boyfriend's name is Barton? What is he, a lord? No. He's an investment banker at a very prestigious firm in New York City. Mm. Why isn't he here? Because he just got promoted to partner, so he is very important and very busy. Sounds like you're making a whole lot of excuses for him. I am not! Okay. What about you? With your sunny disposition, I bet you have girls falling all over you. No. I'm single by choice. With the work I do, I don't really need anyone else. Right. You don't need anyone slowing you down. Exactly. How's this? Do I look like one of your happy photographs yet? Nearly. You ready to face your fears? At least I look like I am. Are these the shoes? These are the shoes. Are there any other colors? No. Okay, now, you want to be aware of everything that's underneath you at all times. 'Kay? Keep your weight on your feet, your arms straight. Kind of like this-- my arms are straight... and I go up, push up... You're a pro at this. Are you sure you're not a guide? [chuckles] That kind of charm is not gonna get you off the hook. Figured I'd try. [Cole laughs] Oh! I'm stuck. No, you're fine. Focus on your feet. Don't look down. My feet are down! Where am I supposed to look? Focus on your footholds. Exactly. Anticipate the next two moves. I anticipate I'm gonna fall. You're not gonna fall. There's about 50% chance that I will. You're just psyching yourself out. You wanna keep your grip relaxed and breathe. [exhales deeply] Good! That's right. So how long have you been taking photos? Ah, since I was young. You're really good at it. Thanks. You know, life never really stops moving. Every time I go into nature, it seems like everything is different. Waves are always rolling, leaves are always growing... nothing stays the same. I guess that's my way of holding onto a moment and capturing it. That's really beautiful. I never thought about nature that way. Well, stick with me, kid. You may just learn a few things. Is that a promise? [laughs] Oh, hey! Yeah. We're at the top! Did you distract me on purpose? Did it work? How do we get down? Oh, you just have to let go. No! I-I can't let go. I'm gonna fall! Falling is a part of climbing. Every climber falls. Does that make sense? You're okay. That's still yet to be determined. One, two, three-- jump. [he chuckles] [yelps, giddy] You're going faster! [laughing] [panting heavily] [laughs] That was fun! Yeah! It was really fun. Thanks, Coach. Now you can tell Lord Barton you passed the test. Tomorrow, we're gonna start your real training. Yeah? But, first... you help me. [♪♪♪] "Taylor Youth"? Is that you? It's a charity I started a few years ago, to raise money for underprivileged kids. Trips and gear can be pretty expensive. This gives them a chance to come to Ridgeline and practice winter sports for free. That's really nice. I got the impression, though, that you didn't want to do a meet-and-greet? -I don't really... -[laughs] ...But 50% of the profits made during Winter Walk goes to The Taylor Youth Foundation. Right now, we're able to send about ten kids each year to winter camps. I'd like that number to go higher, so... If doing a meet-and-greet can help, then... Well, then we better get stapling. And then let's have lunch. [Alex]: I will have the turkey burger with no bun, no cheese, no bacon, no mushrooms or onions... just plai-- is it organic? It doesn't matter. I'll have a cheeseburger, all dressed. Please. Thank you. So... you're a copy editor? Yep. For seven years. It's a good job. It pays well and it's stable. But? Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful to have my job, but... It just makes things a little difficult when my boss only sees me one way. So you feel like you have to prove yourself? Let's just say that no one expects me to be up here, doing extreme sports. Okay. And what do you think? They're probably right. [laughing] Well, tomorrow, we're going to be hiking the woods of Ridgeline. We'll prove that you're supposed to be here. Do you really think that? No. But I guess we'll find out. [both laughing] [phone ringing] Hello? This is your morning wake-up call. Cole? What time is it? Time to face your fears. I'm pretty sure I just fell asleep. And I'm pretty sure the wild waits for no woman. I'll meet you downstairs. Okay, okay, okay. I'm getting up, I'm getting up. Morning, sunshine. Took you long enough. Did I mention that it's, like, five miles to my middle-of- nowhere cabin? Okay, grumpy. Let's get you some coffee. And some breakfast, please. Well, funny you should mention that. That's exactly where we're going. Great. [Alex sighs wearily] I thought you said we were going for breakfast? Patience, my friend. Patience has rarely been my friend. See? That's your problem right there. You live with a city mentality where everything needs to happen instantly. You need to stop and smell the pine trees. Everything that matters is right here, in this moment. You just have to breathe. I don't think that's a city mentality, I think that's just our world. Social media has changed everything. Ahh... ho, ho. Social media. Where everyone can see your status, and it's none of their business. I try to stay as far away from that stuff as possible. You know, I actually think you could have quite the lucrative career, if you had more of an online presence. I mean, not that you're not successful, and not that I know if you have a social media page or not, or anything. Were you Googling me? No. I-I-- No. I... Maybe just... Maybe a little bit. Right. I do have a website but it's for my work, not my personal life. My photos speak for themselves. I take pictures because I have to. That's how I feel about writing. When I don't write, I feel empty. You know, when I was little, I used to write all these short stories about all the amazing places I was gonna visit. Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -Where to? Uh... all over. It doesn't really matter. I've never been to any of them. I guess life and fear just kinda got in the way. Well, look at you now. Facing those fears. Pretty soon, you'll be unstoppable. Well, I don't know about that. Do you have to walk so fast? Oh, wow! [gasping] Look! Such a beautiful waterfall! Keep moving. We're going all the way up there. You don't want to stop and look? No? [Cole]: Let's keep going. It's gonna get icy. Okay. There has to be another way across. No, this is the only way to get to where we're going. [Alex]: Do you know how many people fall from extreme heights every single year? I do! I looked it up. I'm sure you did. But you can do it. I'll be with you every step of the way. Come on. Come on. Yeah! That's right! [Alex]: Oh... See? You're doing great! I bet you say that to everyone. You're right. That's kinda my shtick, actually. You seem like a guy who would have a shtick. I do? No. Not at all. I'm just talking to distract myself from the terror I feel and the sudden desire I have to knock myself out with my shoe. You're learning fast. -[yelps] -Oh! You okay? [panting] Can we please turn around now? You're almost there. You got just a few more steps to do. [steadying breaths] You got this! Yeah! [relieved gasp] Attagirl. I made it? Like I had a doubt. So now you believe in me? One of us has to. Okay. Now, don't freak out, but it's time to go even higher. Way up there. Come on. [Alex, gasps]: Wow. This is beautiful! Yeah, it's one of my favorite lookouts. This is so nice! So, if you could go anywhere, where would it be? Zimbabwe. So I can stand at the foot of Victoria Falls and watch the elephants first-hand. They're such beautiful animals. What about you? I bet you've been everywhere and done everything, right? Yeah, I've traveled a fair bit. Not everywhere, though. What's your number-one bucket-list item, then? Ready? Yeah? [laughs] I would go bungee jumping off Victoria Falls. -No way! -Mm-hmm. Really? Yeah. Really. That is just eerily weird. And crazy! I mean, diving head-first off of a cliff? Why would you want to do that? It's so much prettier from the ground. [laughing] I don't know. There's something about Africa. I'd like to capture it. I haven't taken any new photos... any good photos, I should say, in the past two years. What's stopping you? I think I need to go somewhere, get re-inspired, you know? You should. I can speak from experience, that, so far, this isn't so bad. Good! Then our adventure continues. [chuckles] [Steve]: When you zip through the trees, you'll reach the highest drop of 2,200 feet. Trust me, you've never felt so free. It's awesome! 2,200 feet? [Steve]: Ah, give or take, but let me reassure you, you're in good hands. And the, uh... the equipment? Oh, top-of-the-line. Only the best. Just asking, 'cause, uh, most accidents happen by routine. You know, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. Isn't that the definition of insanity? Well, the two go hand in hand, right? I mean, we're about to jump off a cliff. [Steve]: You're clipped in. And I double-checked you twice. All right, you're good to go. Sweet! Cole. Cole, please. We don't have to do this. Can we just walk back down, the way we came? Alex, if you really want to write about conquering your fears, you're gonna have to take the leap, or else your readers will see right through you. See, I wouldn't take the shots that I take if I wasn't out there doing it, right? You're not in any danger. Trust me, hundreds of people are doing this. Right. I'll go first. I'll wait for you on the other side, okay? Okay. Okay. All right! This is fun. Here we go. [♪♪♪] This is beautiful! [exhales tensely] [Cole]: Come on, Alex! You can do it! He's right. I mean, your fear isn't real. Come on, Alex! [exhales] Okay. I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining thi-i-i-is! [starts laughing] [shrieking giddily] [♪♪♪] ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh ♪ ♪ This moment in time ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Waiting... ♪ ♪ Never did a thing for me ♪ Good? Yeah! I did it! You sure did! You did it. Oh! That was incredible. There you go! How're you feeling? I feel good! That was scary, but it was amazing. Good! Wait. Don't move. What are you doing? I'm just capturing the moment. [shutter snaps] Stay there. [phone ringing] Oh, it's Barton. Give me one second. Hey! Barton! You'll never believe what I just did. Can you hear me? Barton? Yeah! Hey. I just ziplined! It was incredible! [laughing] [writing]: "So, it turns out "I might've been imagining my fear. "I'm still fact-checking this, so stand by, "but what if "we've turned our backs on ourselves for so long, "that when we find ourselves "standing on the precipice of the unknown, "we do what we've always done, "because it's familiar? "When do we stop being a worrier, and start being a warrior?" [phone line ringing] This is Barton Kane. Wait for it. Barton, it's me. Uh, I keep missing you. I guess we're missing each other. Give me a call back. Sarah? Alex! Hey. Hi. You were gonna carry this all by yourself? Ah, it's no big deal. I can see that. Where are you going? Town Square. I'll help you. Come on. You got that? Thanks. Let's just put this right here. Okay. [Cole]: Ahh! There you are. Hey, Cole. Hey, Sarah. Wait. You two know each other? Oh, we go way back. Pre-chairlift. How do you know Cole? Oh, we go way, way back. Pre-pre-chairlift. [Alex laughs] Cole's my Coach. Right. Nice. You need my help with anything? No. No, pretty much everything is set up for Winter Walk. I was actually thinking we should go skiing. Skiing? Uh-huh. I, uh, I think I should probably just stay here and help Sarah. She's got a lot to do. Oh, no, I'm good. You two go. Wait a minute. You don't ski either? Not since I was 12 and grew, like, eight inches. I was all long limbs, flailing down the mountain. [chuckling] Well, that's a sight I'd like to see. It wasn't pretty. They nicknamed me "Snowplow." [Cole]: Ouch. Maybe we can change that. It's okay if we don't. Sometimes, you just have to move forward, you know? Let the past go. Or we can face it. You know-- you, me, and the bunny hill. Come on, Snowplow. Let's go. Bye, Sarah. Bundle up, Alex. It's snowing up there. Have fun! [♪♪♪] Are you sure this is the bunny hill? It looks a lot like a black diamond. Keep your weight centered over your knees, equally distributed. 'Kay... Keep your hands forward. And, after that, it's a bit of a dance. It's swish... swish... [both]: ...Swish. -Okay? -"Swish." Panic will make you lose your rhythm. That's when you wipe out. Right. Just remember-- swish... swish... -"Swish." -Swish. -Okay? -Right. [muttering to self]: Okay. Don't panic. Swish... swish... Swish... Swish... And breathe! Calm glides. [♪♪♪] You okay? You hurt? I'm okay. Are you sure? No. 'Kay, maybe we should put some ice on it. Isn't that what caused the problem in the first place? [laughing] I think I know what will warm us up. What? S'mores! Mm! Let's go. [♪♪♪] [Cole]: So, what do you think so far? Other than a bad hip. Other than the bad hip, and the freezing temperatures-- And the sub-par company. [laughs] That too, yeah. You can be very demanding sometimes. "Demanding"? But... There's a but? I am starting to realize why my boss chose this story. He'd mentioned something about an inner- and an outer-journey, and I think I'm finally understanding what he meant. Yeah, this place can have that affect on people. Or it could just be the sub-par company. [mutters]: She learns fast. Okay, you find the Graham crackers, and I'll track down the marshmallows, okay? Wouldn't they be in the same aisle? You're probably right. [phone rings] Oh, hold on one sec. That's my boss. Just give me a sec. You take it. I'll be right back. Mr. McHugh? Alex, how's it going? Great, actually. Cole Taylor was just teaching me how to ski. You found Cole Taylor? So you're writing the article about him? What? No, I-I thought that you said that you wanted me to write-- If you have access to Cole, use it. Incorporate him into your story. But sir, you said that I was a travel writer, not an investigative journalist. That was before you found him. That's also before I knew him. I don't think he's gonna go for it. The more Cole Taylor, the better. Trust me on this. This could be a real contender for the cover story. Sir, please, I really don't think that-- [call ends] [panting anxiously] Everything okay? Yeah, yeah-- -Great. -Everything's fine. Excellent, because there's a firepit with our names on it. S'mores always remind me of home. Oh, yeah. Where's home? Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Ah, a mountain man through and through. Why leave paradise when it's right in your backyard? That's something that Barton would say. It gotta be hard, being here without Barton. [chuckles] Yeah. It is. Um, this really isn't his kind of thing though. What? Who doesn't like s'mores? [laughing] I know, I mean, I just meant that we don't really do things like this together. We usually do things that are a little more safe. The change of scenery really does put things into perspective. But the silence helps, too. Hell, no! The silence is the reason I can't sleep. Well, the answer is easy. You gotta breathe. So that's your big advice for why I can't sleep? Just try it. If nothing else, it'll keep you alive. [taking a deep breath] [exhaling deeply] You're right. I feel more Zen already. Look at you! I hardly recognize you. [laughing] [both laughing] How come you're not afraid of anything? What do you mean? You're good at everything. And you could just jump off a cliff and fall from the sky with your eyes wide open, not a care in the world. Change your perspective. I mean... Everyone has fears, it's just that mine are different. Different how? Just different. I'm not good with crowds or attention on me. That's why I like to keep to myself. And why you don't want to do the meet-and-greet? But your work is so good! You should be so proud of it. I am. I really am. I just feel weird discussing it. Okay. Goodnight, Alex. Goodnight, Cole. "It's day five, "and up until a few days ago, "I thought the guide who has been training me, "Cole Taylor, "was a brilliant photographer who had nothing left to say. "But I'm beginning to wonder if, perhaps like me, "he's let fear get in the way. "He's the one holding himself back. "The question is... why?" [Max]: Thought you'd be out with Alex. No, I have a lot to do. You shot some new stuff? Oh, great! Make yourself at home. Have you told her how you feel? Max, she has a boyfriend. Then why isn't he here with her? These are really good, Sarah. Oh, it's no big deal. I just thought the kids might like 'em. I can make you one, if you want? Oh, no. That's-- That's fine. Unless you want to, then, sure, I'll take one. So, how's it going with Cole? Yeah, it's... good. I have to admit, you and Cole training together surprised me. Surprised me, too. We didn't really start off on the best foot. He's a great guy. We've been friends for a long time. There's no one more loyal than Cole. Has he always been this private? That's... a part of his charm. When he lets you in, it means something. So... what should yours say? Oh, um... "I'm a worrier, not a warrior." I think you got that backwards. Or not! [laughs] All right, let's do it. How's your hip feeling? It's a little better. Good! 'Cause I have an idea. Uh... you are just full of ideas recently, aren't you? We're just getting started. [laughs] Look at that. Built-in cushion. Oh. Oh, you're mad? Oh, I'm not mad. This is my game-face. You're going down, Taylor. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ready? Yeah! I'm ready. [Alex screams] [Cole]: Here we go! Whoo! [♪♪♪] [laughing] [laughing] Come on. Let's go again! Again? That was so fun! [♪♪♪] [Alex]: When I was a kid, my mom used to make us hot chocolate on cold nights like this. Oh, that's the best, isn't it? Oh, it's so cozy. What about you, did you have any family traditions? Um... yeah. Yeah, actually. Yeah? My mom used to bring me here for one week every summer and every winter. Even back then, Ridgeline was the center of extreme sports. So... so, thanks to my mom, I learned to do everything. Your mom sounds amazing. She was. Um, a real advocate for those less fortunate. She passed away when I was in college. I'm so sorry. So, with Max here, I decided to move to Ridgeline. I couldn't go back home. It just wasn't home anymore. That must've been really hard. I promised her that I'd pick up where she left off. And you started The Taylor Youth Foundation? I want to give kids that are less fortunate the same opportunities that I had. I bet your mom would be really proud. Thanks. I know I can be, um-- [phone rings] [Cole]: You can take it. No, I'll just... I'll just call him back. Go on. I know I can be private about things. The truth is... I went through a break-up a couple years ago, and I'm just starting to see in color again. Cole... I know that you're worried about putting yourself out there at the meet-and-greet, but for what it's worth, when you speak from your heart, like you just did, you are incredibly inspiring. Are you now the coach? Maybe. [♪♪♪] Well, before I knew who Cole was, I really didn't think it was that big of a deal. I thought I'd be helping his career and mine. It was a win-win. But... Now that I know his personal story, I just, I know how upset he'd be if his private life went public. I-I can't keep it from him. If you tell him now, then you risk him saying no, and then you won't have a story, and worse, no career. I know, I... I just feel like I need to be honest with him, regardless. Right now, I feel like I'm lying. Wait... Do you have feelings for him? What? No! No. He's just a friend. No. I mean, I told Barton that I was writing a story on Cole. And...? And he didn't think it was a big deal. I agree with Barton. Do what makes you sleep better at night, but I say do what's best for the story. Right, I think you're both right. If you want, you can send it to me. I'll tell you if you stand a chance before you dig your own grave. Thank you. I appreciate that. Please, don't show anyone. It really is just a first draft. Please. I'm Fort Knox. [chuckles] Okay. Well, I gotta go. Cole's picking me up. We're going skiing! What have you done with my friend? I don't even recognize you anymore. [laughs] Trust me, in some ways, I don't recognize me either, but, in other ways, I finally feel like myself. You are surprisingly calm. Well, I'm trying out this new technique. It's called "screaming on the inside." I see. It's working for you. That, and I figured, if we fall... I would just land on you. [laughing] Is that your big survival plan? Well, one of us has to survive, right? You look like you'd make a better cushion. Why, thanks. I appreciate the concern for my well-being. You've had a good run. Well... [laughs] [♪♪♪] Seriously, though... Thanks, Coach. I know you weren't planning on helping me for this long, but I really appreciate it. Ah, save the thanks for later. You haven't gotten your skis on yet. Mm. That's true. It's so beautiful up here. Hey. Come on. It's time to get the elusive Cole Taylor in a photograph. Ahh... So I can prove to my friends that you actually exist. [snap] [♪♪♪] If the ski hill still intimidates you, then, uh, I haven't done my job. You know, that's what second chances are all about. [exhales deeply] Right. All right, last one to the bottom buys dinner. Let's do this! Okay... Oh... forgot about these. You're doing great! Whew. I can't see. Oh. Ahh. That's so much better. Okay. That's it! Now... slide your skis together as you turn. Hey! You're skiing! Look at that! Olympics, here I come! Oh... Alex? Alex-- stop, stop, stop, stop! [shrieks]: I can't! Wah! Okay! Or you can do that. [laughs] Hey, don't knock the snowplow. It works every single time. Ah, whoa! You okay? -Yeah. I think so. -[Cole laughs] I guess, uh, you're buying dinner. [laughs] Okay, fine. But not until after we do your meet-and-greet. Um, you sure you don't want to go bungee jumping instead? Nice try, Taylor. If I can face my fears, so can you. One more run? Why not? I think I'm getting the hang of it now. [bustling chatter] [indistinct exchange and chuckling] We're almost out of hot chocolate. Max, you told me the meet-and-greet was supposed to be a casual thing. Well, I guess you've got a few fans. I'll start you off, don't worry. Start me off... [Max]: Thank you all for coming! We're thrilled to have renowned nature photographer Cole Taylor here with us in the gallery to talk about his work. He's, uh, excited to meet you, so let's give him a warm welcome. [applauding] Remember why you're doing this. Okay? Speak from your heart. You got this. What a great turnout. I had no idea so many of you cared about the work I do. It means a lot to me. You know, um... coming to Ridgeline as a young boy changed my life, and I'd like to pay it forward. So... 50% of all the sales made this week will go to The Taylor Youth Foundation. [applauding] Thank you. So, please, enjoy the hot chocolate. Come say hi and, um... let's change some lives, shall we? Thank you. Whew. That was amazing! You did so great. You did. Well, I tried this new thing. It's called "screaming on the inside." Oh! I think I've heard of it. [both chuckling] After I talk to some of these guests, how about that dinner? Yeah. [♪♪♪] Oh, I love this place! It's time for the "These Boots Two-Step Dance-Off"! Oh, the two-step! I've always wanted to try it in a country bar. Oh, no, no, no. I've made a fool of myself enough today. Oh, we are just getting started. [groans] You're gonna be good! You're gonna be good. Oh... [♪♪♪] Wow! You're a regular Luke Bryan. Um, well, what can I say? When you're raised country, it's kinda in your bones. That wasn't so bad, right? You are full of surprises, New York. Well, I took a line-dance and two-step class in college, but... In my defense, it was when Hannah Montana's "Hoedown Throwdown" was all the rage. All the rage? All the rage. Right! Here's another surprise. I've had a lot of fun with you this week. And... to top it off, neither one of us were harmed in the making of your adventure. Well, the night is still young. You are a determined woman, aren't you? I'm sure you could've convinced any guy, and he would've helped you, and... been just as charmed. You actually find me charming? I don't think you see yourself clearly. You're captivating. Well... I also think that the world could use a little bit more of Cole Taylor. Actually, I need to talk to you about something. My, uh, my story that I'm writing, um... And the winner of the "These Boots" Dance-Off is... the couple in the back. Come on up here! Claim the prize. Oh, my gosh. [crowd applauding] You go. I'll be right over there. No, no, no. I'll be right with you. [laughing] Steak dinners. Mm. What do you have to say? Uh... I guess these boots were made for dancing. Thank you! And you? Uh, she took the words right out of my mouth. Women do tend to do that, don't they? They do. Well, you two are a lovely couple. Enjoy those steak dinners on us. -Uh, we're actually-- -Starving! [♪♪♪] [applauding] [♪♪♪] Thank you for the ride. Hey, you never finished what you wanted to tell me. Right. Um... Do you want to go into the restaurant and get a hot chocolate? They make it so good, with these little marshmallows on top. It's amazing! Well, you know my weakness for marshmallows. I do. You're gonna love it. -All right. -Yeah? That's a yes. I think this dance, uh... whew, had been a while. I'll take the Presidential Suite, if that's the best there is available? Barton? What're you doing here? Surprising my girl. [♪♪♪] -Barton Kane. -Hi. Alex's boyfriend. Good to meet you. I'm, uh-- This is Cole Taylor. He's my- Right. The guy you're writing the article about. Article on me? Cole, I can explain. No. Um... You know what? It's getting late. I should probably go. Good to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. All good things, I trust? Yes. Sorry. He didn't know? Of course not. I'll be right back. Cole. Cole, wait. Wait. I had no idea that Barton was coming here. I am so sorry. So, it's true? Your article is about me? I was trying to tell you tonight. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Alex... we've been together every day this past week... And you tried to tell me now? [sighing] I know it sounds bad, but it's not what you think. It didn't start out this way. My boss called me and he suggested it, and, of course, I didn't want to write the article anymore, but I had no choice. Didn't you? I helped you... And you took advantage of me. It isn't like that. I opened up to you, Alex. I know. I'm sorry. You have to understand, that I never-- I think I understand quite well. You're not the kind of person I thought you were... And that's a shame. Goodbye, Alex. [engine starts] [♪♪♪] Babe? Are you okay? Why are you here, Barton? I thought this is what you'd want. Am-- Am I missing something? It's just been a really long day. Thank you for coming, but I'm really tired. I just want to go to bed. I'm sorry, I-I didn't realize-- That's okay. I know. I know. Maybe it's for the best. It means I get to have you all to myself. Come here. [♪♪♪] [knocking at door] Whoo! Now, that is a hike! [door creaks shut] What are you doing way out here? I just wanted somewhere peaceful to write. Oh, it's peaceful, all right, but it's like "silenceville". It's creepy. Come on. I have a surprise for you. I wanted to do something that we've never done before. Guess. You're never gonna guess. Heli-skiing? No. No, not even close. Bungee jumping? I can't believe you're not guessing this. Ziplining? Is that your idea of fun? Okay. You know what? Forget it. It's better off as a surprise. Now go get ready. We gotta go. Okay. [♪♪♪] And so I told Simon, in order to cement the deal, we need to look at all angles, forwards and backwards. He can be so near-sighted sometimes. Not seeing what's right in front of him. [Alex]: I think that's Cole. You didn't expect this, did you? [chuckles] Sarah said you hadn't done it. I thought it was brilliant. You talked to Sarah? Yeah. Yeah, it's a great idea. Barton, what are you doing? I haven't been completely honest on why I'm here. I wanted to do it this weekend at the Berkshires, but no matter what I said, I couldn't get you to join me there. Alex... will you marry me? Barton, that is so-- Sweet? I know. Why do you want to marry me? Because I thought that's what you wanted, too. To take the next step in our lives. Look. I really care about you... and I appreciate you coming up here and spending the time, but my travels aren't over yet. I actually think that they're just beginning. I don't want to marry you for the wrong reasons, and I don't think that you should either. You deserve someone who loves you and shares the same joys and passions as you. I really don't think that person is me. I just think that we're going down two separate paths. Maybe you're right. [♪♪♪] [Sarah]: So, when we get up there, you guys, I want us to all-- Just a second. Cole, hey. -Hey. -You okay? Yeah, fine. You saw Barton and Alex? How could I miss it? I'm sorry. Barton asked me to book the sleigh for the proposal, and-- Ah, it's not like I care. It's okay if you do. But she made her choice. I guess, um, that's that. Have fun. [indistinct exchange] Alex, hey... Cole isn't here. Do you know when he'll be back? I don't. Sorry. Well, could you give this to him for me? Tell him it's important, please? Sure. [♪♪♪] She came by. I told her to leave. Thank you. Why did I ask her to leave again? She's happy. She made her choice. She's not who I thought she was. Maybe... but you could've at least listened to what she had to say. It doesn't really matter, does it? She left you this. You want me to open it? Oh, my gosh. Well, it's a check... Alex made a donation to the foundation. ...And a letter. You know what? Just read the letter. Then you can decide how you feel. And for the record, she didn't look happy. [♪♪♪] Been here all week? Yeah. Great place, isn't it? How was your time here at Ridgeline? It was everything I dreamed... and feared. Sounds like an adventure. It sure was. ♪ ...How can I leave a buried treasure behind ♪ ♪ In an ordinary world? ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ The days into years draw nigh ♪ ♪ It's where I'll live until I die... ♪ [phone rings] Hello?

Alex, wow! You look great. You have a glow, like you're glowing. Alex Burns? May I see you, please? [sighing in dread] Sir? I just wanted to say that I know what you read, but I can assure you that it was just a working copy. It's not nearly near finished, if that's even a proper sentence, and it is definitely not representative of my best work. -Is that so? -Yes, sir. That's very impressive then, because I thought it was one of the best articles I've read in a long time. It was? Alex, it was poignant, powerful, self-deprecating, honest, relatable, inspiring, and funny. Great job. I-- [words catch] I'm at a loss for words. Good. Because I have more. You won, Alex. Your story will be on the cover of next month's magazine. [gasps] It will? And I couldn't be prouder. No... but... but it can't. I am so sorry, sir, but I don't have Cole Taylor's permission to tell his story, and I assured him that I wouldn't publish anything without his okay. That won't be necessary. But it is necessary. I-I have a very strong moral compass, and publishing anything without his approval would be wrong. Sir. Alex, you've suddenly become very opinionated. And normally, I would be offended, but I like this newfound gumption. I received word from Cole Taylor about an hour ago. He read your article and he sent me this note to say-- well, why don't you read it? "This email confirms my permission "for Alex Burns use my name and photographs "in her article. Sincerely, Cole Taylor." [♪♪♪] [gasps quietly] "Exhilaration." What's that? [choking up]: I have exhilaration. [laughs] Yes, I would say you do. Congratulations, Alex. You've won a first-class ticket to anywhere in the world, and it would be Around the World Travel's honor and privilege for you to join our full-time writing staff, if you're interested. I am interested, yes! Thank you so much, sir. [♪♪♪] [Cole]: So, this one represents the balance between worlds. Fear... Welcome to Winter Walk. You know, I think you're supposed to get the subject's permission before selling these. That one's my favorite. Mine, too. Cole... in one week, you have literally changed my life. You've pushed me outside of my comfort zone and helped me to believe in myself, in ways I never thought possible. I came here to fulfill a dream... but I never imagined this. Now I can't imagine any adventure without you. I have one last excursion planned. If you're interested, I'll be at the top of the Ridgeline Bridge at 3:00 p.m. today. And here. This is my prize for winning the contest. I want you to have it, so you can keep capturing the moments. [♪♪♪] [Cole]: This is what you had in mind? I thought I'd lost my inspiration. Nothing made sense. Now I know why. I just needed to meet you. Here's a thought. What if we turned this first-class ticket into two tickets to Victoria Falls? I could take pictures and you can write. We could capture Africa's beauty and visit the elephants... together. Do I get to wear one of those cute little safari hats? Yes, ma'am. Yes, you do. [Alex]: We're doing this together. So... are you ready to take the leap into the unknown? With you? Always. Alex Burns... I have fallen head-over-heels in love with you. I love you, too, Cole Taylor.
