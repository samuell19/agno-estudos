YOU ATE CAKE AND THREW IT ALL UP THAT NIGHT. THEN WHAT? THEN I PUT YOU TO BED. WHAT DID DADDY DO? HE SAT IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED FEROCIOUS. THEN HE WENT DOWN TO THE BARN ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND WORKED. AND HE WORKED STRAIGHT UNTIL THE NEXT NIGHT. BRAD CAME BY. AND HE WENT DOWN AND HE SAID, "MR. COBURN, CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND?" DADDY LOOKED RIGHT STRAIGHT THROUGH HIM, LIKE HE WASN'T EVEN THERE. BRAD TOUCHED HIM ON HIS SHOULDER, AND YOU COULD JUST SEE ALL THE RAGE MELT AWAY. HE SAID, "BETH'S GONE." BRAD NODDED. "YES, SIR," HE SAID REAL SOFTLY. AND I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, I WAS GOING TO MARRY BRAD. AND THEN I WAS BORN. AND THEN AUNT BELLE CAME TO STAY. EAVESDROPPER. YOU HAVE HIS EYES, YOU KNOW? WHOSE? GRANDPA'S. WE HAVE TO CHECK ON THE FARM, TAKE CARE OF THINGS. I CAN'T, LILY. NOT YET. I NEVER KNEW HIM, BRAD. I WAS ALWAYS SO SHY AROUND HIM. I COULDN'T TELL WHAT HE WAS THINKING. HE LOVED YOU, LILY. HE WASN'T ONE TO TALK ABOUT HIS FEELINGS. I SPENT HOURS FISHING WITH HIM. WE COULD GO ALL DAY WITHOUT A WORD. BUT WE WERE THERE, TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, LIL? NO. NO, I REALLY DON'T. WELL, HE'D BE SITTING THERE ACROSS FROM ME, RAMROD STRAIGHT, THAT GLINT IN HIS EYE. AND THEN HE'D POINT UP AT THE SUN. I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT-- THAT IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY, THAT HE ENJOYED MY COMPANY, AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET BACK TO YOU AND THE KIDS. ( chuckles softly ) HE CARED FOR YOU DEEPLY, LILY. HE SIMPLY COULD NEVER FIND A WAY TO TELL YOU. DON'T YOU WORRY NONE. WE GOT THINGS UNDER CONTROL. WE KNOW YOU DO, CHARLIE. LILY, I-- I WORKED FOR YOUR DADDY 20-SOME YEARS. WELL, I KEEP EXPECTING HIM TO COME WALKING OUT OF THAT BARN. IT JUST DON'T SEEM RIGHT WITHOUT HIM. WHAT YOU WANNA DO WITH THESE? WHAT'S THAT? HIS FARM JOURNALS. I'LL GO OVER THEM LATER. ( indistinct conversations ) WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ALL GOT TO COME. AND BRAD SUPPORTED ME 100%... ALL I DID WAS STAY AT HOME. DID YOU? YES, I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I WENT TO ROCHESTER FOR THE SUMMER. HE REALLY ENCOURAGED ME. BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GREECE. OH, WHAT HAPPENED TO GREECE? WELL, I HAD TO CHANGE. JUST FOR SOME REASON... EXCUSE ME. MAYBE AFTER THE PARTY. BYE-BYE, DON'T EAT TOO MUCH. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME. OH, I'M HAVING A BLAST-- MRS. MARSHALL, I'M SO PLEASED YOU COULD COME. HOW ARE YOU? FINE, THANK YOU. PROFESSOR COOK, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY HUSBAND BRAD. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SIR. YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD OF YOUR WIFE. WELL, JOSHUA HERE TELLS ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING IN A LOT OF EXTRA STUDY TIME.

( "Star-Spangled Banner" playing) ( radio shuts off ) I SET IT FOR 6:00. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME IT WAS GETTING-- YOU WERE BUSY. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. I WAS READING MY-- I DON'T THINK ANYTHING, LILY. NEXT TIME, COME AND GET ME. OH, IS THAT MY JOB NOW, TOO? CHAUFFEUR, KEEPER OF THE CLOCKS, COOK? COOK? YOU'RE NOT THE COOK, BRAD. I'M THE ONE THAT-- I HAD TO CUT BACK ON TIME AT WORK SO THAT I-- WE AGREED YOU'D-- YOU WALK AROUND WITH YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUDS SPOUTING POETRY. I HAVE TO MEMORIZE THE NAMES AND THE DATES. YEAH, WELL, MEMORIZE THIS, LILY-- I'VE ABOUT HAD IT. I CAN'T COMPETE WITH YOUR COLLEGE CROWD. WHO'S ASKING YOU TO? I NEVER WAS A SMOOTH TALKER. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THE HELL I WAS TODAY. GOING TO TEA, TALKING LITERATURE? I BUILD THINGS, LILY. I COULD DO A 30-MINUTE LECTURE ON MAPLE OR PINE, BUT I COULDN'T HOLD MY OWN THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BRAD. I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO SET FOOT ON THAT CAMPUS AGAIN. DOESN'T MATTER. DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING, LILY? YOU'RE DRIFTING AWAY FROM US ALL, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE-- IT'S THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE EVER WANTED ANYTHING FOR MYSELF. WHY DO I HAVE TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT? CORA LEE INTENTIONALLY PAINTED MIMI AND REFUSES TO APOLOGIZE. 'CAUSE I'M NOT SORRY. HOW COME SHE'S SO MAD AT ME? CAN YOU ANSWER THAT, CORA LEE? I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO TAKE HER HOME FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. AND AFTER LAST MONTH'S INCIDENT, CORA LEE, THIS WILL GO ON YOUR RECORD. IT'S THE FIRST BAD MARK I'VE EVER HAD TO GIVE HER. I LIKE GETTING BAD MARKS. THIS WAY, I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ANY DUMB COLLEGE. THE ONLY PLACE YOU'RE GOING, YOUNG LADY, IS HOME. NOW. ( school bell rings ) CAN YOU PLAY TOMORROW? NAH. I'LL BE BUSY BEING PUNISHED. DID YOU TALK TO CORA LEE? SHE'S GROUNDED FOR A WEEK. I MEANT DID YOU DISCUSS WHY SHE-- SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. I DIDN'T SAY "WHAT." I SAID "WHY." SHE'S 11 YEARS OLD. AND? AND WHAT? THIS IS THE PRELUDE TO HER ANGRY YEARS, BRAD. FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS, HONEY. OH, SHOOT! WHAT? IT'S SCORCHED. SO ANYWAY, SHE'S GROUNDED. SO FRIDAY, YOU GUYS WON'T BE ABLE TO GO OUT. YOU GUYS? FAMILY NIGHT HAS BEEN OVER FOR A LONG TIME NOW. YOU KNOW THAT JOSHUA CAN TUTOR ME ONLY ON FRIDAYS. IT'S MY STUDY DATE. DATE? I TOLD YOU! IT'S LIKE AN EXTRA CLASS, BRAD. I HAVE TO DO IT. OH, I SEE. SO OLD BRAD'LL CONTINUE TO BE THE BABYSITTER WHILE LILY ROMPS AROUND THE LIBRARY. BRAD, YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO DO THIS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? JUST TELL ME! YOU KNEW THINGS WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE. FORGET ABOUT FRIDAY. HELL, IT'S ONLY... IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT DINNER, I'LL TAKE THE KIDS OUT FOR PIZZA. ( doorbell rings ) JOSHUA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU MISSED LAST WEEK'S LECTURE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? OH, MY SON CAME DOWN WITH THE FLU. WHAT A WONDERFUL OLD HOUSE. 1898? OH, THANKS, YEAH. BRAD'S GRANDDADDY BUILT IT. I'M NOT DISTURBING YOUR DINNER OR ANYTHING. YOU STUDYING? OH, YEAH. CATHER, WILLA CATHER, FOR THE MIDTERM. WRONG ONE. WHAT? BETTER CONCENTRATE ON THE POETS. WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS-- YOU'RE KIDDING! FROST, ROBERT LOWELL... WE HARDLY EVEN TOUCHED ON THEM! THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT... THESE FOR YOU TO STUDY. THANK YOU. THAT'S SO NICE. COME ON IN. "CONSIDER, O WOMAN, THIS MY BODY, FOR IT HAS LAIN WITH EMPTY ARMS UPON THE GIDDY HILLS TO DREAM OF YOU." "AMORES." E.E. CUMMINGS. HE WROTE THAT-- WAIT, DON'T TELL ME. ( car approaching ) UM, HE WAS INVOLVED WITH-- HE WAS IN LOVE WITH, UM... THE '20s. 1920s, RIGHT? THAT'S GREAT. GOOD DEAL. OKAY, THE REST OF THIS IS WHAT WE'LL REVIEW WHEN WE GET TOGETHER ON FRIDAY. MOM. OH, JOSHUA JUST BROUGHT BY THE WORK THAT I MISSED WHILE I WAS-- WISH I HAD A DOOR-TO-DOOR TUTOR. WELL, MRS. MARSHALL'S A PRIZE PUPIL. I BET SHE IS. COME ON, GUYS. SORRY FOR BARGING IN, BUT LILY WAS-- UH, MRS. MARSHALL WAS FALLING BEHIND, AND I-I WANTED TO HELP HER-- HE'S HELPING ME PREPARE FOR MY MIDTERM. WELL... THAT'S VERY DEDICATED OF YOU. WILL YOU EXCUSE US? SURE, NO PROBLEM. IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MR. MARSHALL. BRAD. JUST BRAD. HOPE I DIDN'T INCONVENIENCE YOU. NOPE, NOT AT ALL. THANKS AGAIN. I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT. I APPRECIATE THIS, JOSHUA, VERY MUCH. ANYTIME. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO BE A DIPLOMAT. SO POLITE. WELL, I'M JUST A CARPENTER, LILY. HE WAS DOING ME A FAVOR, BRAD. LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT STUDYING EVERY DAMNED NIGHT OF THE WEEK, THAT'S FINE. BUT DON'T BRING HIM BACK HERE. THIS HOUSE IS OFF-LIMITS! HE WAS HELPING ME! HELPING YOU? ( scoffs ) LILY, DON'T BE NAIVE. HE'S-- WHAT? HE'S COMING ON TO YOU! I'M AN OLDER WOMAN. HE'S JUST A KID! LISTEN TO ME. HE THINKS I HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER. I'M FINALLY GETTING AN EDUCATION. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, SLIDE THROUGH IT? SLUMP IN MY SEAT LIKE ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS? I CARE. IS THAT SO WRONG? IS IT? YOU'RE MY WIFE. I DON'T LIKE COMING HOME TO FIND-- YOU HAVEN'T! YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME. IF I HAD TO CHOOSE, IT WOULD BE YOU AND THE KIDS, YOU KNOW THAT. BUT I HAVE THIS CHANCE TO-- REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED YOU, "IS THERE LIFE OUT THERE"? WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANYMORE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS, AND I'M A PART OF IT. FINE. BUT THIS HOUSE IS OFF-LIMITS TO THAT GUY. YOU HEAR ME?! OH, I HEAR YOU, ALL RIGHT. THE PROBLEM IS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU! WELL, SOMEBODY GOT UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED THIS MORNING. I TOLD YOU, LILY, YOU CAN'T BURN THE CANDLE OFF ITS ENDS. AT BOTH ENDS. WHATEVER. MY DAUGHTER'S THE SAME WAY, SPREADS HERSELF TOO THIN. YOU GALS GONNA CHITCHAT ALL MORNING? I ASKED FOR KETCHUP WITH MY EGGS. YOU GOT IT. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SERVICE WITH A SMILE? IS BRAD GIVING YOU TROUBLE? ALL WE DO IS ARGUE. LITTLE THINGS OR BIG ONES? OH, I THINK THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER HAS BITTEN. BRAD? JEALOUS? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE FINALLY A REAL MARRIED COUPLE, ERNA. SILENCE. LOTS OF SILENCE. AND GUILT. I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, I FEEL GUILTY. I LOOK AT THE KIDS, I FEEL GUILTY. I SWEAR, GUILT'S MY MIDDLE NAME. ALL I WANT IS ANOTHER PIECE OF PIE. THAT MAKE SENSE? DEPENDS ON THE PRICE OF THE PIE. ( clock tower tolling in distance ) ( knock on door ) HI. HI. AM I EARLY? NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. COME ON IN. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE. DID YOUR CALL COME? I BEG YOUR PARDON? YOUR LONG-DISTANCE CALL. OH, UH, NO. ANYTIME BETWEEN 7:00 AND 8:00. OH. NICE. WHAT? YOUR PLACE. OH, THANKS. YEAH, I SHARE IT. COUCH IS MINE. BOOKCASE. SOUNDS FUN. YEAH, IT IS. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? SOME WATER? YOU LOOK A LITTLE... BEAT? ( chuckles ) YEAH. YEAH, THANKS. I'D APPRECIATE THAT.

I'M SO USED TO SERVING OTHER PEOPLE. WAITRESS, REMEMBER? EXCEPT WHEN I'M STUDYING. LILY. YES? I, UM... I FEEL... GOD, THIS IS SO CRAZY. UM... I... I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE. IS SOMETHING WRONG? YOU SEEM SO-- WHAT? NO. NO, NOT AT ALL. I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING. THANKS. I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. HEY, WAIT-- NO, NO, LISTEN, IT'S OKAY. IT'S JUST THAT I-- I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY LIKE YOU BEFORE. HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? NO. CUT IT OUT. DAMN IT, STOP IT! AGH! STOP IT! STOP IT! LILY, LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOUR HUSBAND. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF? NOBODY WILL KNOW. I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DON'T GET OFF OF ME... JOSHUA-- SOMEBODY HELP ME! STOP IT! HELP! HELP! STOP IT! HELP-- OW! OW! OW! OW! STOP HITTING ME! STOP IT! PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, JOSHUA. PLEASE DON'T. YOU WANT IT, TOO. NO! FEEL BETTER? IS THERE ANY MILK IN HERE? WE'RE OUT. AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT BUYS GROCERIES AROUND HERE? ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG? NO. COME ON. YOU CAN'T WALK AROUND LIKE A VOLCANO. I'LL TAKE THE KIDS FOR AN ICE CREAM. TALK TO BRAD, LILY. YOU CAN TELL HIM ANYTHING. HEY. HEY. YOU'RE HOME EARLY. I'M HOME. SOMETHING HAPPENED. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW THAT BOY, JOSHUA? YEAH. WE MET, REMEMBER? DON'T. DON'T WHAT? MAKE IT ANY HARDER. WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? NOTHING. HE MADE A PASS AT ME. WELL, MORE THAN A PASS. HE TRIED TO-- HE WOULDN'T GET OFF OF ME. I FEEL SO VIOLATED. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT... YES. WAIT, DID HE RAPE-- ALMOST. THAT SON OF A B... HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO STUPID? I'LL KILL HIM! NO, BRAD, WAIT! I'LL BREAK EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY! NO, IT'S OVER, BRAD! PUNCHING HIM OUT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE! WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT ANYWAY? WHAT? YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN, LILY. YEAH, RIGHT, A WOMAN, NOT A MIND READER. IT'S ALL MY FAULT NOW? IS THAT IT? HAVE I GOT THE RULES DOWN? NO, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT OF HIM-- I'M SICK OF MEN! I'M SICK OF SCHOOL! I'M FINISHED. WAIT, LILY! LILY, WAIT! YOU COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER. ME? MM-HMM. DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT IT? MIMI GORMAN SAID THAT I'D STARVE TO DEATH AND NOBODY WOULD WANT TO MARRY ME. SHE SAID THAT IF I WAS A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER-- OH, HONEY, MIMI GORMAN'S LIVING IN THE DARK AGES. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO GET MARRIED ANYWAYS. MOM? ARE YOU OKAY? CORA LEE, DON'T EVER LET ANYBODY STOP YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANNA DO. EVEN IF IT'S DUMB? HAVING A DREAM ISN'T DUMB, HONEY. WASTING LIFE IS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. GRANDPA DID WHAT HE WANTED, HUH? HE SURE DID. HE WAS THE BEST FARMER EVER. AND DAD, HE'S A-- MASTER CARPENTER. BUT BELLE, SHE DOES WHAT SHE WANTS, AND IT'S ALL UPSIDE DOWN. GROWING PAINS. ENRAGED HORMONES. BIOLOGY, MOM. I SURE DO LOVE YOU, CORA LEE. YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, OKAY? DON'T EVER FORGET. ARE YOU GOING AWAY OR SOMETHING, MOM? YOU SOUND SO-- NOT IF I CAN HELP IT. I'M GONNA BE AROUND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, TILL I'M OLD AND GRAY. NIGHT, NOW. LILY. MY MIND'S MADE UP. LILY, YOU CAN'T QUIT SCHOOL JUST BECAUSE SOME KID-- ONE EGG OR TWO? REPORT HIM. WHO'D BELIEVE ME? IT'D BE MY WORD AGAINST HIS. BESIDES THAT, EVEN YOU SAID I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE-- I WAS OUT OF LINE. JUST THE THOUGHT OF HIM TOUCHING YOU-- NO, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT HIM, I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING. YOU HAVE TO GO BACK, LILY. I BELIEVED ALL OF HIS COMPLIMENTS. I ATE IT UP. I EVEN GOT TO THINKING I WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, SMART. YOU ARE. YEAH, WELL, IT'S TIME I CAME BACK TO EARTH. OH, SO HE WINS, HUH? HANG 'EM UP, BRAD. HANG WHAT UP? YOUR CHAUFFEUR'S KEYS. I'LL PICK THE KIDS UP NEXT WEEK. SO THAT'S IT, HUH? LILY PUTS HER DREAMS BACK ON THE SHELF. LIL, REMEMBER BACK WHEN WE WERE DATING? EVERY DAY YOU'D GO TO YOUR CLASSES. EVEN BACK THEN, I WAS AFRAID I'D LOSE YOU. BUT I KEPT RIGHT ON PURSUING YOU. I WANTED TO MARRY YOU, HAVE A FAMILY. AND WHEN YOU AGREED, WHEN YOU QUIT COLLEGE, I WONDERED IF I HADN'T TAKEN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF OUR LOVE, MAKING YOU CHOOSE LIKE THAT. BRAD, I'D CHOOSE YOU AGAIN. WELL, YOU ALREADY HAVE ME, LILY. SO WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO, I'M WITH YOU. YOUR SEMESTER FINAL WILL BE ON THE 8th OF NEXT MONTH. THIS WILL BE AN ORAL EXAM CONCENTRATING ON ENGLISH AND AMERICAN LITERATURE IN THE 20th CENTURY, COMPARING THEM TO THE GREEKS AND ROMANS. YOU WILL BE GRADED ON CONTENT AND STYLE. MR. HARRISON WILL HELP CONDUCT THE EXAMINATION. MRS. MARSHALL! MRS. MARSHALL... I'VE PREPARED SOME OF YOUR EXAM QUESTIONS. AND? I KNOW YOUR WEAK SPOTS. IS THAT A WARNING? A FACT. YOU WANT ME TO DROP OUT, DON'T YOU? IT REALLY GETS YOUR BACK UP HAVING ME HERE. YOU THOUGHT AFTER WHAT YOU DID... I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'D DISAPPEAR. LOOK, STAY, GO, IT DOESN'T AFFECT-- OH, IT AFFECTS YOU, JOSHUA. I'M YOUR SILENT REMINDER. EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT AFTERNOON. YOU CROSSED THE LINE. I DIDN'T-- I'M OFF-LIMITS. UNDERSTAND? ANY WOMAN WHO SAYS "NO" IS OFF-LIMITS... WHETHER SHE'S A SORORITY GIRL IN A LOW-CUT DRESS OR A TRUSTING HOUSEWIFE. I THOUGHT-- OH, NO, THAT'S THE TROUBLE. YOU WEREN'T THINKING. WHERE THE HELL DO YOU COME OFF THINKING WE'RE YOUR PROPERTY? I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS. I GUESS WE WERE BOTH FOOLED, HUH? ALL RIGHT. IN FITZGERALD'S NOVEL "THE GREAT GATSBY," WHO-- FACTS AND FIGURES. NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME ANYMORE. SURE, IT DOES. I CAN'T STAND UP AND-- I WASN'T GOOD AT ORAL RECITATION. SAYS WHO? I REMEMBER A GIRL WITH FLAME-RED HAIR STANDING ONSTAGE IN HIGH SCHOOL, HANDS CLENCHED. "I CAN'T BE TALKING OF LOVE, DEAR. I CAN'T BE TALKING OF LOVE. IF THERE BE ONE THING I CAN'T TALK OF, THAT ONE THING BE LOVE. BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING THAT I'M NOT LOVING. STILL WATER, YOU KNOW, RUNS DEEP." "AND I DO BE LOVING SO DEEP, DEAR, I BE LOVING YOU IN MY SLEEP." I NEVER WILL FORGET THOSE WORDS. I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THEY WERE FOR ME. I CAN'T RECALL WHO WROTE THEM, BUT I STILL SEE HER SO CLEARLY, THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE NO GOOD AT ORAL RECITATIONS. YOU BURNED THAT POEM INTO MY HEART, LILY. AND IF THAT ISN'T GOOD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. HEY, ARE YOU CRYING? I GUESS. ABOUT GRANDPA STILL? HOW ABOUT COMING OUT TO THE FARM WITH US? YOU CAN'T AVOID GOING BY THERE FOREVER, MALCOLM. HOW COME? WELL, FOR ONE THING, IT'D MEAN GIVING UP FISHING. WE COULD GO DOWN TO BOONESVILLE. THEY'VE GOT A POND-- BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE THE MEMORIES, THOUGH, WOULD IT? IS HE REAL OLD? FOR A DOG, YEAH. UH-HUH. AND YOU? ( chuckles ) WELL, MAYBE IN YOUR EYES, BUT NOT IN MINE. YOU KNOW, I USED TO WONDER WHY LIFE HAD TO BE SO TEMPORARY. I FIGURED IT'S SO WE WOULDN'T WASTE A MINUTE OF IT. LIKE ME GOING OFF TO SCHOOL AND AUNT BELLE ALWAYS ON THE RUN. IF THINGS WERE FOREVER, THEY WOULDN'T BE SO PRECIOUS. FOREVER'S NOT LONG ENOUGH. WHY, IN 20 YEARS, THIS TREE HOUSE WILL STILL BE HERE. 'CAUSE DAD'S A MASTER CARPENTER? MM-HMM. AND WHO KNOWS, COULD BE ANOTHER LITTLE BOY HIDING IN ITS BRANCHES. COULD BE MY GRANDSON. IT'S A CYCLE, MALCOLM. ALL WE CAN DO IS LIVE IT THE BEST WE KNOW HOW. ( Cook on tape ) AND HE TELLS US THAT EURIPIDES DEALS WITH HUMAN BEHAVIOR NOT AS IT SHOULD BE, BUT AS IT REALLY IS... THAT WAS CARL. ON THE PHONE? HAND ME THAT SPONGE, BELLE, PLEASE? OBVIOUSLY CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY EMOTION, PASSION... HE WONDERED WHEN I WAS GOING BACK. WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. I KNOW. THAT'S THE TROUBLE. THE MORE I'M AWAY FROM HIM, THE LESS I MISS HIM. COULD I TURN THIS OFF? YEAH, GO AHEAD. OF HIS 18 SURVIVING PLAY-- AT FIRST, IT WAS FUN, COOKING FOR HIM-- WELL, NOT COOKING, BUT YOU KNOW, ORDERING TAKEOUT. THEN IT WAS BORING. TROUBLE IS, HE WAS TOTALLY HAPPY. EVEN TALKED ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED. HE SAID I'D WEAR WHITE TULLE. IMAGINE ME ON HIS MOTORCYCLE WEARING WHITE TULLE? ( chuckles ) I THINK I GAVE UP ON HIM RIGHT THEN. HE WAS CRYING. JUST NOW? I THINK HE KNOWS HE'S SEEN THE LAST OF ME. AH, HE'LL GET OVER IT. I THINK YOU'VE GONE AND GROWN UP ON ME, BELLE. STRANGE, HUH? YEAH. HEY. HEY. I'LL MAKE YOU SOME TEA. NO, IT'LL KEEP ME UP. ( chuckles ) YOU ARE UP, LILY. YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT ALL NIGHT. HOW AM I GONNA STAND UP THERE AND BE BRILLIANT, ESPECIALLY... JOSHUA? HE KEEPS LOOKING AT ME. I WISH YOU'D LET ME PUNCH HIM OUT. ( laughs ) WHAT'S THAT? OH, IT'S NOTHING. WORDS. I JUST KEEP GOING OVER DADDY'S JOURNAL AND THOUGHTS JUST SPILL OUT OF ME. YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT TODAY, LILY. AM I? MM-HMM. I CAN'T SEEM TO OUTGROW IT, BRAD, WANTING COLLEGE, WANTING TO GRADUATE. MAYBE SOMEDAY I COULD WORK THERE, YOU KNOW, BECOME AN ADVISOR. THOSE KIDS REALLY NEED SOME GUIDANCE. ( sighs ) HOW'D WE EVER WIND UP TOGETHER, LILY? YOU'RE A WOMAN WHO'S ALWAYS SEARCHING. I'M A MAN WHO DIDN'T WANT TO CHANGE. HERE. I'LL THINK YOU'LL APPRECIATE IT. HE'S MY NEW FAVORITE AUTHOR. HE WRITES ABOUT LAND AND THE PRICE OF GRAIN AND THE ENORMOUS LOVE HE HAS FOR HIS FAMILY. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WOMEN ARE JUST GLAD IF THEY KNOW AT LEAST ONE GREAT MAN IN THEIR LIFE. I'VE KNOWN TWO. WELL, GUESS I BETTER GET THE SUIT AND TIE OUT. WHY? TAKE YOU TO YOUR NEXT COLLEGE TEA. THAT'S WHAT GREAT MEN DO, ISN'T IT? YOU REMEMBER THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN I SAID I WAS SICK OF MEN? UH-HUH. YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME, DID YOU? NOPE. GOOD. ( laughs ) OH, MAN. THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY. ARE YOU ENJOYING THE RIDE? OH, YES'M, I CERTAINLY AM. ( humming ) I'LL PICK YOU UP AFTER. WE CAN CELEBRATE. EITHER WAY? OKAY. ( horn honks ) GOOD LUCK! AND, UM, DASHIELL HAMMETT, HE ALSO USED HIS OWN LIFE. I MEAN, HE HAD BEEN A DETECTIVE FOR EIGHT YEARS, AND HE WROTE ABOUT-- I MEAN, HE-- HE STARTED WRITING DETECTIVE FICTION. UH, HE WAS KIND OF THE ORIGINATOR OF THE "HARD-BOIL" STYLE. YOU'VE GIVEN EXAMPLES OF AUTHORS WHOSE VERY PROFESSIONS LED THEM INTO THEIR CAREERS. ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL DETECTIVE WRITERS MUST HAVE DONE POLICE WORK? NO, I-- I-- NO, AGATHA CHRISTIE, SHE WANTED TO BE A SINGER, REMEMBER? AND SHE EVEN STUDIED IN PARIS. UH, SHE WASN'T ANY GOOD AT IT, SO, UH, SHE WROTE TO ESCAPE HER REALITY. I THINK WE SHOULD GO ON TO THE GREEKS. ALL RIGHT. UH, MRS. MARSHALL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH POPULAR FICTION. I ASSUME YOU TOOK THE TIME TO READ UP ON SOPHOCLES, AESCHYLUS, AND EURIPIDES. A LITTLE. GOOD. ALL THREE WROTE VERSIONS OF "ELECTRA." HOW DOES EURIPIDES DIFFER FROM THE OTHERS? TAKE YOUR TIME. HIS "ELECTRA" WASN'T BORN IN A PALACE. SHE WAS A FARM GIRL. HE HUMANIZED HIS CHARACTERS. ORESTES WAS A VAGABOND. THE OTHER TWO AUTHORS, THEIR ELECTRAS WERE GODDESSES. BUT EURIPIDES TURNED HER INTO A REGULAR PERSON, A WOMAN WORRIED ABOUT FAMILY, KIDS... A WAITRESS TYPE. I'M VERY PLEASED WITH HER WORK. YOUR THEME, PLEASE. YES, SIR. THE PIECE OF WRITING THAT INSPIRED ME, THAT... TRULY TOUCHED MY SOUL, IT WASN'T FROM ANY VOLUME OF POETRY. IT WAS FROM A FARMER'S JOURNAL. HE WROTE ABOUT THE PRICE OF FEED, THE WEATHER, HOW MANY FISH HE CAUGHT THAT DAY. IT WASN'T WHAT YOU'D CALL FANCY WRITING, BUT IT MADE ME SIT DOWN AND WRITE A PIECE OF MY OWN. "THE GREATEST MAN I NEVER KNEW LIVED JUST DOWN THE HALL. AND EVERY DAY, WE SAID HELLO, BUT NEVER TOUCHED AT ALL. HE WAS IN HIS PAPER. I WAS IN MY ROOM. HOW WAS I TO KNOW HE THOUGHT I HUNG THE MOON? THE GREATEST MAN I NEVER KNEW CAME HOME LATE EVERY NIGHT. HE NEVER HAD TOO MUCH TO SAY. TOO MUCH WAS ON HIS MIND. I NEVER REALLY KNEW HIM, AND NOW IT SEEMS SO SAD. EVERYTHING HE GAVE TO US TOOK ALL HE HAD. THEN THE DAYS TURNED INTO YEARS AND THE MEMORIES TO BLACK AND WHITE. HE GREW COLD LIKE AN OLD WINTER WIND BLOWING ACROSS MY LIFE. THE GREATEST WORDS I NEVER HEARD I GUESS I'LL NEVER HEAR. THE MAN I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER DIE HAS BEEN DEAD ALMOST A YEAR. HE WAS GOOD AT BUSINESS, BUT THERE WAS BUSINESS LEFT TO DO. HE NEVER SAID HE LOVED ME. GUESS HE THOUGHT I KNEW." EXCELLENT WORK, LILY. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. THANK YOU, SIR. CONGRATULATIONS, MRS. MARSHALL. THANK YOU, JOSHUA. I DID IT! ( laughs ) I DID IT, BRAD. I KNEW YOU COULD. BRAD. BRAD... HEY, LOOK-- I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT. I'M SORRY. YOU'RE NOT SO TOUGH NOW, ARE YOU? BRAD, DON'T. LISTEN TO ME-- NO, YOU LISTEN. YOU EVEN SO MUCH AS LOOK AT MY WIFE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME! BRAD, HE-- I'M TRYING TO-- YOU GOT IT? LILY! MRS. MARSHALL. YOU WERE THE BEST STUDENT I EVER HAD. IS THAT AN APOLOGY? WELL, I DON'T BUY IT. YOU MESSED WITH THE WRONG WOMAN, JOSHUA. YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE A TEACHER? WELL, THEN TEACH THOSE KIDS THAT NO MEANS NO. TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF SELF-RESPECT. I'M PUTTING THE WORD OUT ON YOU AND YOUR STUDY DATES, BUDDY. COME ON, BRAD. HERE. IN CASE YOU GET LOST. HOW AM I GONNA GET LOST WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO? BYE, HANDSOME. ( laughs ) TAKE CARE, HUH? I WILL, PROMISE. I LOVE YOU, LILY. I LOVE YOU TOO, ANNABELLE. ( camera whirs ) SO LONG, SHUTTERBUG. WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO DRIVE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN A BEAT-UP OLD TRUCK? SHE'S NEVER GOING TO GROW UP, MOM. OH, NO, CORA LEE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING. WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT. YOU WROTE THIS? UH-HUH. "THE GREATEST WORDS I NEVER HEARD I GUESS I'LL NEVER HEAR." HE WAS PROUD OF YOU, LIL. YOU GOT THE JOURNALS TO PROVE IT. I KNOW. FUNNY. DADDY'S CONVERSATIONS, WE-- WE COULDN'T-- I WAS IN HIS KITCHEN TRYING TO GET SOME ANSWERS. TO WHAT? US. WAS MY GOING BACK TO SCHOOL RIGHT? WAS IT SELFISH? ( chuckles ) WHAT'D HE SAY? THAT IT WAS BETWEEN YOU AND ME. HE HAD A WAY WITH WORDS, YOUR DAD. HE DID, HUH? OH, SURE. THAT MEANT, "LIL, YOU GOT A HUSBAND WHO LOVES YOU. SO IF YOU'VE GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE'S THINKING, GO AND ASK HIM AND KEEP ME OUT OF IT." YOU'RE GREAT, LILY. I KNEW IT THEN, AND I KNOW IT NOW. GOT A LOT OF EMPTY PAGES TO FILL UP HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? TWO MORE YEARS OF CRAMMING. CASSEROLES. FITZGERALD. CAN YOU TAKE IT? LET'S GIVE IT A TRY, LIL. CONGRATULATIONS. LILY MARSHALL! MOM! WAY TO GO, LIL! CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LILY! THAT'S MY WIFE. THAT'S MY WIFE. MY WIFE!
