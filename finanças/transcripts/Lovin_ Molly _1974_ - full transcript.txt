Lots of times I was busy, and other times I'd see Eddie's car and have to go back. But I knew if I was a little patient we'd be able to get together. Those times was well worth the wait. You look about as hot as I am! - Oh, I'm glad you've come! - Just bought three sections of land adjoining me on the north, borrowed the money from a bank in Austin. - Well, that's wonderful, Gid. I've been saving something to show you. - What have you got that I ain't already seen? ♪ ♪ - This, Gid. ♪ ♪ Don't that make you glad? I am so proud. - Why, sure, if it's what you've been wanting.

I am so glad that the first one was yours. ♪ ♪ - I'll see you in a day or two. ♪ ♪ I never rode off from Molly in my life if I didn't want to turn and go back a dozen times. She always stood right where you left her as long as she could see you. I remember her that afternoon all sweaty and loving. I felt Molly was just as permanent as my land. ♪ ♪ - You cut that out! You've got to learn how to drive, man! - It seemed like I had spent a lot of my life watching Gid or Johnny going or coming across that hill. It was all right. I enjoyed being there where they could find me if they took a notion to come back, and they always had. ♪ ♪ - I wish you would have bought that red convertible. A woman likes you needs a car to haul her boyfriends around. - Well, now, you know, I think I would like one that's open so as I could climb out if I needed too. - You'd need to if I was in there with you. - Maybe I should have bought that Cadillac. You know, he was the nicest salesman. - Yeah, he'd a sold you a limousine in another ten minutes. - Well, it's my money, you know? ♪ ♪ Thank you. - Here you go. - All right. ♪ ♪ Thank you very much. - It drives like a good car, just stiff. - Yeah, well, it better be good. I intend it to last me for the rest of my life. Johnny was never happier when he was helping out. He was staying at Gid's old ranch house, and Gid was living in town in the house that Sarah had made and built. My house was awful empty. Eddie had died two years after we married. Even the children were gone. Matt, my son with Gid, was in the Navy and off fighting somewhere in the Pacific. A few months after Matt was born, I could see that Johnny wanted a child also, and I liked the idea. We had a son, Joe. But he died in action over Germany. Joe was born two years after Matt. He had been nothing but happiness for us both, but the war had taken him away from me forever. - I knew you'd smile sooner or later. - Well, about three more weeks and I'll be able to cook you up some roasted ears, hm? - Mm-hmm. - Where's your boss? - Oh, he's out buying himself another ranch for me to take care of. Gid is plain land-crazy. - You just let him go ahead now. Everybody is some kind of crazy. - What kind of crazy are you? - Just plain crazy. - Molly? - Hm? - I'm woman crazy. - Hey, would you like to help me tie up some tomato plants? - No, I want to be treated like company for a change, not like a damn hand. - Well, pardon me. - No, actually why I'm here is, I came a-courting. - Well! - Yeah. - Why, yes, son. I'll marry you. You just let me go in and get my pocketbook, and I'll go pay the preacher. - Oh, hush. I'd just as soon marry an alligator. You sure are nice to me. I'd have probably been a cripple years ago if it hadn't been for you. - You could have put some liniment on this, you know, if you weren't so careless with yourself. - It's so much nicer when you do it. You can rub my back a little bit if you want to. - I can? All right. - This is the good life. - What is good? - Good old Joe. He was so full of life. - You know, I was always afraid he'd marry one of them English girls and bring her home to Texas and not know what to do with her. - He was quite a boy. - I remember his face when I told him you was his real dad. It just tickled him so. I always thought he suspected it, but when he grinned at the news, I cried for half an hour, I was so relieved. ♪ ♪ - I guess Gid's bought another five sections by now. - Tell him to come by and see me soon, huh? He don't come by very much since they moved into town. - I'd just as soon not encourage the competition. - Well, he never heard the news tonight. Don't suppose you're interested. - No, not particularly. When the Japs and Germans cross the county line, then I'll be interested. - Mm. - Oh, I apologize. ♪ ♪ I sure enjoyed the meal. ♪ ♪ - I was scared you'd blown plumb away. - Oh, oh! Oh, my lord, I overslept. I bet that milk cow thinks she's forgot. - Oh. - Mm. - I don't know what I was to do if you was to blow away. - Oh, well, hush. I won't. - Well, I never meant to come out here and go back to bed. - Oh, lord, you are the silliest man alive. Maybe that's why I love you. You know, when we were young, I didn't think you were silly at all. - I'll go milk. - Well, go on. I'll get some breakfast. [car honking] Morning! - Morning, Mrs. White. - What have you got for me this morning? - From overseas. Looks like a letter from Matt. - It is! It is from Matt. - Anything from Matt? - No. I felt dry inside and out when I lied to Gid, and part of me wanted to show him Matt's letter. If I had, he might never have left me again. - I just wish we could make it up to Matt some way, whatever it is we done wrong. I don't reckon he hates us, does he? - Oh, yes. - The Army might change him. Might be a little more tolerant when he comes home. You oughtn't to cry. Now, if this was Sarah, she'd have on stockings. - Talking about Matt that day made me sad. Everybody knew he was Gid's son, and Matt hated us for what it had done to his life. Sarah thought I was so trashy anyway, she was glad to have Matt and Joe around for proof. She even got some of her club ladies behind her, and for a while I'd get letters addressed to "Molly White, Adulterer," or "Molly, the Fornicator." Well, the way I looked at it, if I'd done them things, I'd done them with Eddie, and he's the one I was married to. I was crazy about Eddie sometimes, about the way his hair was always shaggy on the back of his neck. It may be why I married him, silly as that is. [dogs barking] - Hey, Molly, come here. you gotta see this. - What? - Come here. - What you think about that, huh? - It's just dogs breeding. It's only natural. - Yeah, it just come natural for you, too, don't it? Yeah, but I'm better than those two cowboys put together. Ain't that right? Look at that bitch. - Well, Eddie, I didn't know you liked to watch so much. Hey, would you like to move the mirror over by the bed so you can watch us? - All right. By God, let's do it! - [laughs] - Come on! - Ooh, careful! Oh, my goodness. - Come on! - Once Dad told me that if I got married, to marry Eddie. Dad said, "Eddie will never have more to his name "than a fancy automobile, "but at least, by God, he drinks, and he'll treat you like a wife ought to be treated." They never brought Eddie home after he died. He was killed on an oil rig and was buried in Chickasaw, Oklahoma. - I'm sorry, Mrs. White. I guess they're going to get all the boys before it's over. [car honking] - They killed my oldest boy. - Would you like to come in? - Drive me home, Gid. What's life going to leave me, Gid? I'm sorry. - Why, Molly? He's the only son we'll ever have. - What's the matter, huh? - After all these years, I'm still crazy in love with you, but I got to tell you that I ain't gonna do this anymore, and I guess I'm sad 'cause it's our last time. It's got to be that way. - Gid, this ain't one bit of my business. But do you and Sarah ever do this? - Yeah, sometimes. - Well, then if she don't care to give it, and I do, then what's the harm of letting me? Well, you just enjoy me a whole lot, I can tell that, and that's what I want you to do. Are you ashamed of me, too? - Who's good enough to be ashamed of you? - Well, Matt was ashamed of me. - I'm ashamed of both of us, and that's part of the reason I've made up my mind like I have. - Well, why are you ashamed and I'm not? I mean, I thought really caring about a person made the difference. - I don't know. I was raised to believe that what we do is wrong. The church says so, too, and so does the law. - Well, I'm just me, Gid. I ain't the church. I ain't the law. - A lot of people think stealing's wrong except when it's them stealing, so if this here's wrong, then it's wrong when we do it too, now ain't it? - All I can say about it is that if it's wrong, then let's you and I just have the guts to be wrong. Oh, we can't but go to hell for it, and that'd be a lot better than doing without you! - We already ruined one child's life. I got a granddaughter now that's got to be considered. Molly, you could marry Johnny. - Oh, Johnny! Johnny don't want to get married, and I don't either, but you know you've always been my mainstay. - Then why didn't you marry me? Why did you marry that no-good bastard Eddie? Why didn't you marry me? - Hmm, now, that's hard to say. I guess it's because I always thought that he needed me more than you. I was wrong. - Well, it just about ruined my life, Molly! I wish I knew what was involved in all this... loving someone. Mostly a lot of damn heartbreak, I know that. - Well, I know that at least we have done something that was good. Please don't quit me again! - I'll be by whenever I can risk it. - Well, then goodbye, damn you, because you can't ever risk it! I've liked it, and I ain't ashamed of anything! Matt's dead, but your quitting me won't make up nothing to him! - I never quit nothing in my life! - If you can think of a prettier word for it, fine! You're the one that has clothes on! ♪ ♪ - "I just got your letter saying Joe was killed. "I hope I'm as lucky. "I know now I'll never get over the bitterness I feel.

"Must be why after all these years, he never married you. I guess you won't be hearing from me again." ♪ ♪ - God knows whether I'd done the right thing burning that letter. It would've broken Gid's heart to see it, and grief would've kept him by me, but I didn't want him that way. I couldn't answer Gid's question about why I married Eddie, either. I guess that says something pretty bad about me. I knew what I like to eat and smell and do and some bigger things about giving and taking, but knowing about why I married Eddie wouldn't have made it any less done. ♪ ♪ - Hey, Molly!

That's just made me miserable, that's all. - Not as miserable as it's made him. Oh, you and I may never kill nobody over one another, but we're comfortable, and I just--I want us to keep on being that way. - I don't know. I might kill a person or two for you. Johnny? - Mm-hmm? - What do you think about what we do? - Well, it's enjoyable. - No, but do you think that it has been wrong for me all these years to do what we've-- - No, no. - No? - After all, we raised a fine son. I sure do miss him, but I never missed a night's sleep in my life from being ashamed. - I wish Gid would agree. - Hm. Yep. - Maybe you'll come and see me soon, will you? - Mm-hmm. - Now that I'm straightened out on who you are. - Oh, don't you worry. You won't even know whether I'm living here or not. ♪ ♪ - I found this puppy, Molly. You want to raise him? - Of course. I'll get him a box. - Can I help? - I can manage. I'll get you some lemonade.

After Gid left, I sat there a while. My menfolk began rising with the Moon. Dad and Eddie, they were drunk, had whiskey on their breath. Matt was looking away from me, thinking of school. Joe, he was laughing, and Johnny was lazing along, grinning about something. But Gid was looking at my face and wishing he could put his hand on my hair. - We had a good shower a couple days ago. - No more than an inch, Molly said. That's burned off. - Now, you've been laying here half-conscious in an air-conditioned room for ten days, and you're trying to tell me how hot it is. - How's the cattle? - All died of blackleg. How's that for calamity? When you coming home? - Two days. They're trying to give me two more weeks. - Molly says they want you to ease up. - Doctors had their way, whole world would be sitting on its butt. - Oh... Gid, now, this... It's a... [laughs] - Ah! - No. - Gid? Gid. Gid-- - [laughs] - Ah, how would it be if this gentleman left so you could take a nap? - It wouldn't be worth a damn. I'll sleep when I get sleepy, like I done all my life. - You old cowboys think the world revolves around you. - [laughs] - Bring the pickup around to the side. I've had my crawful. How's Molly? - Lonesome. - Well, it's her fault. Someone needs to make her a little less independent. - I could spit on two fellas who've been trying to do that their whole lives. - Take me to Molly's! If I go home, they'll just knock me out and haul me back to the hospital. - If I can't keep him from going, you make sure that he takes it easy, would you? - Gid was out of bed within a few days, but for a while there, I thought he was gonna stay on with Molly for the rest of his life. Where that would've left me, I didn't know. - I don't know how to thank you, Molly. - I do. You can go right back in out of this cold wind, get into bed, and you stay there! - Got to get to working. - Well, all right, honey, but you don't have to leave. You can go to work, and then you could come back here. - Can't, not for right now, anyway. Oh, running off from the hospital like that ain't the right way to settle anything. Many thanks again for taking care of me. - You're right welcome, Gid. God bless you. - Wish I could've thought of a nicer way to leave. - It's about time you pleased yourself a little if you're ever going to. - You can't just run off and do something like that on the spur of the moment. There's a right way and a wrong! - And you're the only man alive that can tell them apart. - I got a notion to go live with Molly for good. Might have a few years' peace. Damn! This pipe's hot enough to fry an egg on. Throw me up them gloves, will you? - As much money as you got, and you're still fighting a goddamn windmill! Why do you do it? - Sometimes I wonder myself. When Sarah gets back from visiting her cousin, I'm gonna tell her. That bother you much, if I was to move in with Molly? - No, it don't bother me a bit. It'd be good for both of you. Seems like you've been up there for days! - I guess it would, though. After all, we've kind of shared her, haven't we? - Turn her on! Gid! - Damn side hurts. You should take me over to Molly's. Maybe this time I'll have the sense to stay where I belong. - I'd be willing to have the doctor look at you first, and I'll drive you out there tonight or the first thing in the morning. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Country's too dry. Sure do wish it would rain. Oh, me, Johnny.

I don't expect I'll ever see another one like him. You remember that saddle he gave me? That's the most expensive saddle ever made at Brown's Saddle Shop. And we had a big fight the day that he gave it to me. It was over you, I guess. - Well, Johnny, I swear! That is the first time I have ever seen you embarrassed. I've had to wait a lot of years. - Well, it ain't because of that. You caused that many times. You stayed too pretty, Molly. It's 'cause of Gid that I'm embarrassed. - Not that I want you to be. That's nature. She ain't no respecter. I don't want you to be embarrassed no matter if you're 100 years old. You better not waste it either. - You don't want to wrestle like we used to, do you? - I lost my girlish strength. - Oh, you never had none. You was just awful wiggly. Molly, what would you think about us marrying? - I think we ain't the kind, honey. But thank you a whole lot for asking. - I could have asked you about 30 years ago. - We lived then pretty good. Marrying ain't as important a question as a lot of people think. Just because we ain't marrying don't mean you're free to miss a night. You're welcome here every night all night when you feel like putting up with me. - Well, I'll be here in time to carve the beef. - He had left me the old pickup and 1,000 acres of land.
