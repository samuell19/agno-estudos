Those guys are fighting. Don't you want to help? Just let them be. Let's fight one on one. What if someone gets hurt? It's none of our business. - Let's go. - Call the police. My phone's dead. - You can't just ignore it like that. - Fine. Hurry up! What kind of nonsense is this? Calm down. Don't get angry. I know. I'll pay up. It's only RM3,000, right? I know. I'll pay soon. Sir. I'm so sorry, sir. - Watch where you're going. - I'm sorry, sir. - What if I hit you just now? - No. So do I have to pay you? - I already apologized. - So what now? I already apologized, didn't I? What else do you want? Yes. You know how hectic the traffic here in KL is, right? I'm almost there. I'm in front. Dear. I'm sorry, okay? I was running a bit late. Dear, please don't be mad. Dear? Dear? All right, I'll blow out the candles. One, two, three! Excuse me. How about we take a picture? All right, let's do it. Yes, dear? I'm still here at the office. There's a meeting. I'll be home late tonight, all right? I'm lying? No, I'm not lying. I'm in the meeting and we're having dinner here. I'm coming right now. Hold on! If you hit me, you're the one who's in the wrong! It's a small matter! What's this? A coward! - He's innocent! - Come here if you're so brave! Come here if you dare! - Sir, I'm innocent! - Let go. Hey, it wasn't me! It wasn't me! Do you understand? Do it gently! - Did anyone follow you here? - No. Where's the evidence? - We're in danger. - Don't worry, Borhan. I've been getting death threats before too. Why didn't you provide this evidence to the police? You know the answer, right? I'd rather put my trust in you, Azhar. We have to recover. Otherwise, Aziz will only die in vain. I'll make sure he gets punished for what he has done. You have to save your family, Azhar. At any given time, he can kill us. A person like him deserves to... Borhan! - Let's go, before the police arrive. - Let's go. I did give a ride to someone to this place as well. I suspect she works as a... It's not nice to speculate on her job. Also, it's not nice to judge other people. Isn't that right? But her clothes were so sexy. It gave me chills when I dropped her off there. I'm working towards becoming a more religious person. Whenever a test like that comes along, of course I'll be shaken. Thank god my faith is not easily shaken. I was able to resist all temptations. Sir! - Sir? - Yes? We're here. You can get off now. It's all right. Sir. Don't forget to rate me with five stars! All right? Guys, run away! - Run from the uncle! - What a rude bunch! I can't even go to sleep! Such a party pooper. Sir, are you new here? Why have I never seen you before? Did you just move here? Listen, sir. I'm famous here for selling second-hand items. Tell me what you want. But I wouldn't call it second-hand. Just look at the quality. You can choose a phone with one, two, or even three cameras. No, thank you. Hey, ride carefully. It hurts! Don't be late tomorrow. Goodbye! Can I have a kiss? Don't make me punch you. Such a pervert! You're always going out at night! Just stay at home, won't you? Like you're not used to me going out every night! Why can't you just stay at home this time around? Who are you going to meet? I'll be at my normal hangout place with my friends! - You're going to meet her, aren't you? - Which woman? The woman whose photo you liked just now. It was her, right? It makes no sense. I only liked her picture. When you liked it, it means you like her! Jeez, this is why I hate being at home! It's so noisy! So now it's my fault! Darling, I've told you so many times, don't call me when I'm at home. She has been asking so many questions. Listen, darling. I promise I'll call you back tomorrow. Darling, please don't say that. I can buy you just anything you want. Hafiz. Hafiz! Wait! Before I embarrass you any further, you'd better leave. - Where's your mom? - You don't need to know. You have to help me take your mom far away from this place! Where to? You've abandoned us for years. You've never cared about our well being all this while. Now suddenly you're standing here, asking me and Mom to move out. Why? Did you put up this house as collateral for the loan sharks? Take your mom far away from here. If not, both of you... Hafiz! Hafiz! Open the door, Hafiz! Open the door, Hafiz! Hafiz, open the door! Hafiz. Where have you been? You disappeared for two years without any news. Mom has been worried sick. Where I go is none of your business. I don't have to tell you. - I'm only here to see your mom. - What for? So you can break her heart even more? Don't you pity her? Enough. There's no need for a person like him. He doesn't care about you or us. Also, it's not the first time he did this to us. Even if he's dead, we'll never know! You rude brat! Mom, I'm off to work! Eat something first. Who was here last night? Your ex-boyfriend. Your dad came back? I didn't know how he knew we lived here. He also told us to move out of this place. Move out? Mom, that's enough. There's no use thinking about someone who never cared about you. UTC DAMAI, 1ST FLOOR TOILET, MS-UG-6 - Hafiz! - Din. - Off to work, are you? - Do I look like I'm going swimming? I need to provide for my family. I have to pay for everything. Nothing in this world comes for free! I purposely said it louder. I told my wife I'm going to work, but that's not true. I'm going to take this. A second wife? It doesn't mean a second wife when I showed that sign. I'm not picking up my second wife. I'm picking up my second bike. I got it yesterday. But my wife doesn't know. If she finds out, then you're invited to my funeral, okay? You're picking up your bike as if you're hiding another wife. You have no idea how jealous my wife gets. Jeez, her jealousy of the bike can make us end up in court. If I'm cheating on her, then it's going to be the supreme court. It's not that hard to stay in shape. You have to watch what you eat. - Mr. Nizam? - You're late. Don't you know I'm hungry? - I'm sorry, sir. - Sorry? That's all you can say. I'm tired of it. Mr. Malek? - Here's your food order. - It has arrived. - It looks delicious. Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, wait up. This is for you. - It's all right, Mr. Malek. - It's all right. I bought a lot. At least, it will boost your energy a little. - Thank you, Mr. Malek. - You're welcome. Whatever happens, happens. I'll try my best to get her number. Thank you. Please come again. Welcome. Sofia, that's enough. Leave your work here and serve your crush. Give him the menu. - He's not my crush. - Just go. This is the moment. Go right now. Just go. Gosh, this stubborn child. Hi, there. What would you like to eat today? The usual? Yes. The usual. Okay. Hey, you. Can I have... What do you want? I wanted what's on the menu just now. - The muffin? - Yes. - How many? - Two. Okay. How are you doing? Good? This is a good choice. These muffins are on the house. Have a taste. Don't just look at it. If it's delicious, let the whole nation know. You can make it go viral. You can tweet about it. If it's not good, just keep your mouth shut. Understand? No. I'm just... You talk too much. Just grab a bite. You don't want to? Do you want me to feed you? How sweet. You're so sweet. I'll feed it to you, okay? You're too picky. It's all right. It's all right. Just have a bite. Eat up. Isn't that delicious? - That's enough. - It's the latest on the menu! Where's... Sofia, get some water. Sofia, hurry up! How could you order food without drinks? Hey, drink up. Don't choke and die here. Miss. Make it takeout. - I have to go to work. - Work is all you do. You work all the time. No wonder your body is tense here. It's done. Miss. Would you mind if... - Can I have... - Have what? Can I have the tissue? Right, tissue? Sure. Would that be enough? It is. How much is this? RM36,90. "M-S-U-G-6"? Can't it be used? No, it's fine. As long as there's a serial number, it's valid. If you're a husband, of course you have to be stern. It's because we're the ones who put food on the table. That's right. It's true that she bought the washing machine and furniture. That doesn't matter. Remember what we do? - We put food on the table! - That's right. Also, you must be helpful as well even when you're being stern. - Women do a lot. - That's right. We should help lighten their load as well. Great! That means I've got what it takes. - What do you mean? - To be your brother-in-law. How can I have someone lazy and hairy as my brother-in-law? - That's not possible. - What are friends for? Don't be like this. My sister has already passed away! - That's impossible! - It's true! As we know, there are multiple active charity organizations in our country. Hey! Stop scrolling TikTok. No, it's not TikTok. - Look at this. - Successfully raised funds of RM20,000 within three days. We're very privileged to have a special guest here with us the founder of Al-Iman Foundation. Dato Jaafar Yusuf. How are you, Dato? I'm good. So can you share with us the objective of your latest charity project, Dato? The latest project is none other than trying to help my fellow people. Dato Jaafar's a great man. He'll come offering help as soon as he can. Just like Superman! That's why he's loved by many. People say he's only here for publicity. He just wants to get on television. It's not like he asked to be on television. He has done so much good. I'm sure those reporters need to find good content to make it viral. Even when you're doing something good, there'll be haters. But I can see that he's really genuine when it comes to helping the poor. But when you think about it... Why are you late? What time is it now? You're not punctual. Calm down. Do you have anything for us? You've got no patience at all. Gosh, English breakfast again today. I'm sure it's from the girl at the shop. You're lucky it's free. She's not my girlfriend. Not yet. Did you get it? Get what? Did you get together with the girl? I don't even have her number. How am I to get her? You're too old-fashioned in dating. Unlike me, if I want it, I'll ask for it! Walk the walk, not talk the talk. - Not you bragging. - You even included a proverb. Hold on. Yes, that's me. I'll open it now. I'll open it now. Is this Mr. Azhar Majid? Dear... Dear. My goodness. Sir, I'll close it now. Sir. Sir. - Yes? - Have a bit of respect. Have some respect for the deceased. I'm sorry, sir. I respect everyone who enters this room. Be it the living or the dead. It's just that the term "respect" has a vast meaning. Right? Sure, we must always respect the dead. But what about when they were alive? We often overlooked it. Whatever it is, I'm sorry for your loss. Don't worry. I'll do my best in handling the body. God's willing. All right? Mom, I'll be going out for work later. Your dad just passed away. - We just buried him. Can you just... - Mom! - What? - Enough. We're done with him. There's no need to think about him anymore. At least, you're free now. He won't be causing us any more headaches. I'm sure he's rolling in the grave right now. Why are you being so rude? Are you still angry at him? You're angry because he left us back then? Do you want to know why? Let me tell you. He was a reporter. Due to his bravery and honesty, that's the reason why our whole family was nearly murdered. There were people coming to kill us! He didn't want that to happen. Why did he make me hate him so much all this while? He had to look like the bad guy in your eyes. He did that to make you hate him and get angry at him! It's because he wanted us both to be safe. He sacrificed by separating from us and lived all alone. It's because he loved me and he loved you. Did you know that? My goodness. Miss, if you're interested in doing an investment, call me. I'm Roki. See you later, miss. Thank you. Who are you looking for? No one. I'm sure you're looking for the pretty boy, right? Nonsense. No, I'm not. There's no need to hide. Based on your eyes and reaction, I already know. Don't try to trick me. I've been there before. Did you hear the news? What news? His dad passed away. Someone murdered him. Gosh. Why? Hafiz? Why did you bring me here? Rather than staying at the alley, it's better to come up here to gather your thoughts. At least, there's a nice view here. Right? Hafiz. Sorry for your loss. How's your mom? - She's doing well. - I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to offer you my advice. When you suddenly lose your loved one, it's a different kind of pain. Please take care of your mom. All right, Kak Bie. Thank you. Mom! You're awake. Who are you guys? What a question. I like that. There you go! Mom! Mom! Who are you guys? What have we done to you? Look here. Do you recognize him? You recognize him, right? What's your relationship with him? He's my dad. We got a cute guy! Out with the old, in with the new! A dead dad is replaced by his son instead. Listen here. The night your dad met you, I'm sure he gave you something. What did he give you? Tell me. I know nothing. Please let me go. Please! Don't make me angry! Where is your cell phone? What do you mean? I have nothing with me right now. I can kill your mom the same way I did your dad! If you don't want anything to happen to your mom, don't play around with me. I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. Now I'm furious! So why did he go and see you? I have no idea. I don't know. He just told me to... The RM100 note. The RM100 note? There's a name of a place on that note. All right. Where's the money? I already spent it. You're toying with me. Do you want me to blow her into pieces? Hold on! Hold on! Trust me, I can get the money back. I just need some time to get the money back and the address. But please, don't hurt my mom! Please. I can give you until midnight tonight. Retrieve the money. After you get the money, call me. Don't call the police. If you call the police, I'll ask my men to dig a grave for your mom and you'll be leading her funeral prayer. All right, I understand. I won't call the police. My face is smudged now. Do you understand? I do. Excuse me. Do you want to hear a story? Sir. Sir. - Wake up, sir. - Sir. Sir. Are you all right? Wake up. Sir, are you all right? Sir, why are you lying down in a place like this? Were you robbed? How can I help you? I'm sorry, dude! Hey! My bicycle! This is why I hate helping people out. Hey, is this the place to dump the waste? Can't you see? We are selling flowers here! Out of all the dramas that I starred in, which one is your favorite? Actually, I don't watch much television since I'm mostly busy at work. Not even one? - No. - Jeez, you're really missing out. You should've seen the one that's trending now, The Cliff Brothers. - Did you see it? - No, I didn't. That's the one you're supposed to see. I starred as the eldest brother in it. I was the leading actor in it. But there wasn't much scene. You have to see it, okay? It will be a big loss if you don't. All right, I'll see the movie later. I'd like to get back to work. Wait. Have you followed my Instagram? - In there, you can get... - Sofia! Sofia, where's the RM100 note? RM100 note? - Who is he? Is he bothering you? - No, he's a friend of mine. Hold on. Hold on, okay? - Don't forget to follow my IG. - Okay. I have a customer right now. What's going on? Where is the RM100 I gave you to pay for the food yesterday? Can't you wait? I have a customer to attend to. Sofia, this is a matter of life and death. You must help me. Where's the RM100 note, Sofia? I... I just gave it to the customer just now. Where is he? That's him. Hafiz. Sir! Can I ask for your help? With what? My friend told me she gave you a change of RM100 note. - Yes. What's the matter? - Sir, can I have the money? What's the matter with you? I mean I'd like to exchange money with you. You wanted to change? Hold on. I've got no cash right now. Sir, listen. I don't have cash with me now. Can I wire it to you later? - Wire the money? - Can I do that? Are you high or what? I don't even know you. Why do you think I would agree to that? Don't waste my time. Rude brat. I'm sorry, sir! I'll pay you back later. I'm sorry, sir! If you want the money, just ask for it, idiot! POLICE - Hey! - I'm sorry, sir! Hey! That hurts! That hurts! Are you blind? Didn't you see me pass by? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Look at you! You didn't mean to? I know men like you love to take advantage! Just say you wanted to hit on me. Luckily, I'm in a good mood today. If not, I won't forgive the likes of you! Hello. I have the RM100 note with me. Good. Good. Where are you? Hello? - Hello? - Hey! - What's the matter with you? - Someone's after me. Hey, why did you chase after my sister? Sir, she took my money. Why were you stealing? Where's the money? Where's the money? - What a hassle! It's just 100 bucks. - It is still money. What's with you? Here. Take back your money. - Thank you, sir. - Who said I wanted to give it to you? Sir, let's settle this nicely. I don't want to cause trouble here because I have a bigger problem now. - Please, sir. - Then we'll make it worse. Here, grab it if you can. - Take it! - Sir, please. Take it properly! - Here, take this. - Sir, please. I need that money back. Please, sir. Please! Take it then! Please, I'm not looking for a fight with you. But I do want to fight with you! - Get up. - Get up. Let's go! Let's go! - Get up. - Okay. Don't come here and cause trouble. This place is cursed. You'll get in trouble if something happens. Are you okay? Do you want me to take you to the clinic? It's all right, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. They took my money. - How much? - A hundred. Did you have to fight over a mere hundred? It's okay, sir. It's okay. Thank you. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes. Thank you. Please come again. Dear, you told me you wanted to watch your diet, yet you bought so much. This is the best muffin in KL. I'll start cutting back tomorrow. Are you going to stop loving me if I get fat? It doesn't matter, darling. Eat all you want. I'm okay with it. - That's why you're my boyfriend. - Okay. Welcome. Hafiz. What happened to you? - I couldn't get the money back, Sofia. - The money? The RM100 note? I can lend it to you if you need it. No, Sofia! I don't need money. I don't even want that RM100 note. I just need the clue on the note to save my mom's life now, Sofia. Save your mom? What's going on? If your dad had something to do with what they're looking for, I'm sure he would keep other clues. Hafiz. Look at me. Your dad must know something. I think the first place that you need to look is his house. The problem is, I don't know where he lived. I'm sure your mom will know. NO. 45B, RAJA MUDA MUSA ROAD 4, 50300, KUALA LUMPUR Are you sure this is his house? This is the address. Sofia. - I don't feel good about this. - Since we're already here, let's go. I don't know what your dad was hiding, but it must be something important. If not, why would people break into his house? VIP SCANDAL Hafiz! "Azhar bin Majid". Is he your dad? BY AZHAR BIN MAJID FREEZE 730 BANK ACCOUNTS No wonder his name sounds familiar. I used to love reading his articles. But it's weird. Among all the articles about these scandals, there's only one article about Dato Jaafar's charity. DATO JAAFAR DONATES TO ORPHANAGE FOUNDATION Who? Dato Jaafar. The one who likes to help people. He's a kind person. I like him. He's kind. He's also rich. The kind and rich type. But I just found out that he used to be poor too. So he was not highly educated. But since he worked very hard, he started achieving higher positions, then started helping people out. Now, he has become an icon to everyone. He's so cool. I'd like to become like him as well. Is that you? Yes. I never thought that he would keep my pictures. Hafiz. Let's try and turn on the laptop. We need the password. Hafiz. Let's try and turn it on. Try it with your mom's birth date. The date they got married? Your birth date. Try it. What can we find on this laptop? This. "Work." "Current issues, road accidents, prostitution, refugees, high-profile murders." "A reporter was killed by..." Who's that? Wait, where are you going? Hafiz. - You're here. - If King wants me to look for the money or whatever clue that's on the money, I have my own way of finding it. Have you turned on the laptop? Have you figured out the password? Good, that makes my work easier. Thank you. Sofia. Are you all right? If only I had given him a chance to explain what happened that night, things wouldn't have ended up like this, Sofia. - I'm such an ungrateful son! - Can you shut up? You're not the only one who made mistakes. There's a solution to everything. You just have to focus. We have to make a police report. That's the only way we can save your mom. We have no other choice now. - There is a way. - Hafiz! What are you looking at? That girl took my RM100 note. Let's celebrate this weekend. I just got RM1,000! That hurts. What's the matter with you? Don't make me slap you. Hold on. Hafiz! A random kid was running into me. Just tell me where you want to eat. Where do you want to go? Where's my RM100 note? Where's my money? - That hurts! - Where's my money? - That hurts! - Don't be too rough on her. Don't trust her. She's a big con. Give me back my money. Where is it? If not, I'll take you to the police station! - There's no need to involve the police! - You're afraid, aren't you? Give me back my RM100 note! You little... But you have to follow me first. There's no need to touch me! Let me go. Don't try to fool us. - We're almost here. - Where? Over there! It hurts! Let me go! What place is this? It's our hangout spot. You wanted to trap us, right? What's with you? Your money is over there. Your money is in the tin box. Go and get it. Hold her. Hold her. Take this glass. If she acts up, just stab her with it. Be careful. Where is it? Are you looking for this note? Dude, please. Don't hurt her. I just want the money back. My brother, just stab both of them. They were grabbing my hands roughly. Please don't. I'm running out of time, dude. Please, I really need that money. Is that so? Hold her tightly. Go there! Right now, I'd like to ask you something first. Where's the guy who hit me from the back just now? Come out here if you dare! Show your face! That's not the gentleman's way. Come here! Where? Where is he? He's not here. Also, I don't know him, dude. Tell me how much you want. I can give it to you. I just want the RM100 note back! Hey, stay still! Right now, you're so bent on getting your mere RM100 back. What did you just say? You can give me however I want? Come on, dude! What are you talking about? All right, listen. Take a look at that money. Something's written on it, right? UTC DAMAI, 1ST FLOOR TOILET, MS-UG-6 That's actually a clue to lead us to where the looted money is hidden. Hidden looted money. What are you rambling about? My brother. - Don't trust them. They're lying! - Please believe me. I'll split the money 50-50 with you. If you don't trust me, I can take you there. How long are you going to live like this, dude? You won't lose anything by trusting me. Fine. Say if I do believe in you. I'll follow you to that place. But if you lie to me, then you're finished. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. Lan? - Hey. - What? Follow him inside, I'll wait outside. Where is it? Show it! Where is it? What's the matter? What's the matter? - What's up? - What's up with you? - I asked you first! - What's the matter with you? - Why are you looking at me? - What's your problem? Calm down, dude. Relax. You're lucky your partner stopped you. If not, I'll smack that pretty face of yours! I'm pissed off. What's the matter with you? Where is it? Show me! Hurry up! UTC DAMAI, 1ST FLOOR TOILET, MS-UG-6 Where is it? Show me! It's not here. Where is it? Where is it? UTC DAMAI, 1ST FLOOR TOILET, MS-UG-6 What are you looking at? Go inside and find it quickly! Hey. Sorry, it stinks a little. Did you eat garbage? Why does it stink so bad? Whether or not I eat garbage is none of your business, as long as I'm not garbage like you. Here's another piece of advice. If you hate the stench, don't enter the toilet then. You're making me very offended. - Where's the money? - I don't think it's here. I think it's somewhere else, but it's not far away. Just not here. Try and look at this. I knew it! You guys are making me sick! If an elderly comes in and sees what you are doing, they'll get a heart attack! For God's sake. Hey, you! Get up! Look at this. How did he escape? Shut your mouth. Wait for my revenge! Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia, are you all right? Police are still investigating the theft case that happened at a cafe in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon. A young man in his 20s was said to have stolen RM100 before making his escape by hanging on at the back of a truck. The incident was recorded by the public that was nearby. For those who have more information, please go to the nearest police station to help with further investigation. You're famous now. - You? - Yes, me. I was the one that helped you this afternoon. You're such a forgetful person. Anyway, thank you so much for getting my phone back. You must be wondering why everyone wants this phone so much. You must be confused, right? It's because there's a really precious secret here. I'm sure you want to know what's on the phone. Fine, I'll show it to you guys. You showered them with promises. You blinded all the villagers with money. Then you robbed their children instead! Then you blamed the syndicate. Don't you think I didn't know? The syndicate is yours! Please. Get rid of him. Such a nuisance. Do you know who that was just now? Can you tell? Dato Jaafar. You're right. Dato Jaafar the philanthropist, graciously helping everyone, and acting gracious, when he has been the head all this while! He's the head of the evil syndicate in our country! The foundation that he owns is just a front. So who are you? - Why do you want to kill us? - No. I don't want to kill both of you. I just wanted this phone back. I followed you around for the whole day to get this phone. It's so tiring. It was so tiring just to get this phone back. Who was the man that got murdered by Dato Jaafar? It was a long story. The man that you saw was named Aziz. He was a reporter. This all started because he was trying to reveal Dato Jaafar's secrets. Right? So naturally, the old man got angry, right? He shot him. I'm sure you want to know how I knew all this. It's because I'm the one who recorded the video. And this phone belongs to me. So I made up a plan. I could use the video to extort money from Dato Jaafar. But my phone got stolen from Aziz's brother. His name is Borhan. Borhan wants to use the video to reveal Dato Jaafar's secrets through your dad. Azhar. Right now, Aziz, Borhan, and your dad are all dead. Dude, I'm begging you. Please return the phone to me. If not, they'll kill my mom. Do you think Jaafar will let you go once you give him the phone? Both of you are already dead. Just waiting for the right time. Hello, Dato Jaafar. I want the RM2 million that I requested. I'll see you at the rooftop parking at Damai, tonight at 11:00 p.m. You guys can just rest here first. Once I get the money, I'll come here and release you guys. Nice. Is this the only one? That's the only one. I didn't make a copy of the video. So you're in the clear now, right? I'll excuse myself then. Girlfriend, goodbye. Hold on. You've made a mistake here. You think you're the smart one. This is the problem with you, Dato. When people say you're stupid, you get angry. Do you truly believe I didn't make a copy of your video? Those lackeys at the back will never find that video that I kept! With that stupid behavior of yours! You guys really don't fear death, I guess? I truly despise it when people call me stupid. Idiot! King. Find out where he kept all the copies of the video. Find all of it, don't leave out even one! Understand? Let's go. Move! Just move! What's the matter? Who are these kids? He is Azhar's son, Dato. His mom is also with us. Azhar Majid? Just shoot him. I know where he kept the copies. What? We were held hostage by Samir during that time. He thought we were unconscious. But I remember where he kept them. I can take you there. Trust me, I'll help you find them. Very well then. I trust you. Hey, follow him and get the items. But leave this girl with me here. Come here. There's no need for drama. Come here. Where is it? There's a guy there. He has the phone. Samir gave the phone to him. Why are you still looking for me? What's your problem? Are you here to look for my brother as well? I want the phone that Samir gave to you. What phone are you talking about? I have no time for your nonsense. Just pass the phone to me. - Do I look like a phone seller? - Just give them to me! You scum. That hurts. ENTER Are you all right? What? Those scratches on your face. I fell just now. They look pretty bad. After you. Police are still investigating the theft case that happened at a cafe in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon.

I'll post it, okay? - I'll get going. Hey. Go and see the doctor. Hello? - The guy tricked us. - I'm sure he did! We deserved that! You're both idiots. You can't even handle a small guy and a small matter! You're big-sized but pea-brained! Let's just kill these bitches, Dato. Also, I'll certainly make sure to find that guy and the phone with my life. Wait! Hafiz! Where's the phone? It's here. I can give it to you. But let my mom and girlfriend go. They're innocent! Your mom is innocent? Mom! Hey! Kid, I'd like to remind you I'm not someone whom you can play around with! I just shot your mom. If you're trying to act smart with me, this girl will die as well. Where's the phone? Give me the phone. You're a devil! You're truly a devil! Hey, scumbag! You killed my dad and you shot my mom too! They are innocent! You're not even worth a cent now. I can shoot you anytime! When was the last time you logged into Facebook? It has been a while, right? You let your admin run it. And your admin is lazy and ignorant! Log into your Facebook right now! I think your video already went viral! IS THAT DATO JAAFAR? ARE YOU SERIOUS? THAT GUY WAS HIT AND SHOT! IS THAT THE PHILANTHROPIST? HE LOOKS KIND BUT WHO KNOWS? ROBBERY? MURDER? WHAT IS THIS? WE HAVE A PROOF. JUST ARREST HIM! Shit. What are you waiting for? Shoot! Go and look for your girlfriend! Go now! I'll look after your mom. It's all right. Just go! Do not try to move. Please cooperate. Everyone, on your knees. Sergeant. - Goodness. - Corporal. Call an ambulance. Where is Hafiz? Sofia! Sofia! Sofia? Sofia! Hafiz, don't do it! - Don't! - You killed my dad. You also tried to kill my mom. He deserves to die! Put the gun down, Hafiz! Don't act rashly. Put down the gun! Now you're brave enough to shoot me? Do it then! Shoot me! Shoot me! I repeat, put the gun down. People like him don't deserve to live in this world. This is my last warning, Hafiz. Put down the gun! Hafiz, don't do it! "So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned." Allah Almighty speaks the truth. Forgive me, Dad. Forgive me. Doctor, how's my mom's condition? Thank goodness she has regained consciousness. Is there anything serious? As of now, her health is showing positive recovery. No other effects for now. Forgive her. She's not winking at you. She has a condition called Tourette Syndrome. - Can I visit her then? - Sure, but limit the conversation. She needs to rest. Understood. Thank you, doctor. Let's go. Please don't make it too obvious. Thank you for accompanying me to work. Do you want to come in? I'll buy you coffee. It's all right. Your cheeky manager always makes me uncomfortable. I'll get going. Hafiz, the bicycle that you took the other day. - The owner took it back. - He did? How did he know his bicycle was here? Siti helped make it viral. That's a relief. Actually, I have something to tell you. You're nice to my mom. You guys talk to each other a lot. Where did you learn that? They say if you want to win the son's heart, you must win the mom's heart first. So are you trying to say that you're trying to win my heart? Yes, because you're too slow. Does that mean we are... What are you talking about? Gosh, please. Do we have to declare everything? It's enough that both of us know what's going on. Hey, kid! Where is my RM100?
