(energetic music) (hip electronic music) (mysterious music) (vibrant jazz music) - Everyone left. - Yeah, are you surprised? - Kind of. - Kind of? - Well, I mean, it was my 40th birthday, and you're a very thoughtful person, so I thought maybe you might do something like this. - I was hoping to surprise you. - I didn't expect all the people here. It was nice, I had fun. - Nice enough for you to stay? - No, I can't. I have to wrap some things up and get on a plane in the morning. - I hate your business trips. - Yeah, that makes two of us. But I have to do what I have to do. - I guess. - Hey, come on. You know, I'd rather be here with you, right? - Yeah. (lips smacking) (vibrant jazz music) - So, you'll wait for me? - Of course, I'll wait for you. Okay. 'Cause I'll be back. (lips smacking) - I have to go. - Okay. - All right. Bye. - Bye. (suspenseful music) (door thuds) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirp) (tires rumble) (siren wails) - Damn. (siren wails) (car door slams) (suspenseful music) Hey, how's it going, Officer? Doing good? I know what you're gonna say, I was speeding. I'm sorry, I was a little tired. I wanted to get home. (thunder cracks) You know, it happens to be my birthday today. I mean, any way you can let me go without a ticket? I mean, you can't give a guy a ticket on his birthday, right? (dramatic music) Listen, Officer, it looks like maybe you're having a bad night. And I get that, that's cool. Tell you what I'll do, I'm gonna take off right now. I'm gonna go home, and I won't be a bother anymore. Sound good? What do you say? - You have the right to remain silent! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (energetic rock music) (Miller sings to himself) - Yo. What's happening? Yo, hello. Good morning. (shades tap) Stay. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, ha. Do, do, do, do, do, do. Morning, got your coffee. - You're late. - I apologize, I went to go get coffee. This fat lady was on line ordering everything on the menu. Donuts, cookies, cake. I mean, I don't understand why people don't just use the app, that's why they invented it. - If you left your home earlier, you'd have more time. And it wouldn't matter if there's a fat person at the front of the line, right? - But, Captain, I mean, you know, I'm a night owl. The fact that I'm even here right now, this early, is a miracle within itself. - Do you know why I asked for your company this morning? - You missed my smiling face, you were lonely. - No. And if I was lonely, I wouldn't be asking for you. - Ah, that hurts my feelings. - Good, finally has some feelings. Now, explain to me what happened on Friday night. - Friday night? Yo, yo, let me tell you about Friday night. It was crazy, all right? I met this girl named Shanita. She's like, "I'm trying to come over and eat your booty." I'm like, "Okay, cool." So, I gave her my address, she came through. She was about an hour late, but I had already cleaned up and washed everything out, right? So, I washed everything out, we gon get started. She was like, "Can you set the camera up?" I'm like, "Yeah, I can set the camera up, girl, go ahead." So, I started setting the camera before she could start. You talking about like work stuff not my personal. - More specific. - All right. - The broken door, the broken coffee table, a smashed flat screen TV. And not to mention two potential lawsuits that they're trying to shove up my ass. - Two lawsuits, your? You didn't even do anything. - Explain it, Miller. What happened on Friday night? - Okay, all right, all right, just relax, relax. I'll explain. - Don't tell me to relax. I need an explanation. - Here at work, before I went home and had my fun evening, Val and I got a call, domestic violence, right? So, this guy we've had a file on him, quite some time. We get there, I knock on the door. I can hear the woman inside crying, right? So, he opens the door up and slams it in my face. I knock on the door again. He opens it up, slams it on my face a second time. So, third time I just made sure he couldn't open or close his door, right? - Coffee table and TV. - We got inside, check on the woman. Val makes sure she's okay, I go back to the dude. I say to him, do you want to dance? And he wanted to dance, so we ended up dancing together. He tripped over his foot, and his face just smashed into the coffee table. I mean, if he was a better dancer, we wouldn't have had that problem. Okay, TV's my fault 'cause he was watching that show with that cook dude. That French guy, he's always mean to all the other chefs. I don't like that, I don't like that dude. And I don't like crepes either. So, I went ahead to the TV and smashed it myself, so the TV is my fault. (Captain laughs) (Captain sighs) (hand knocks) - Val, come in. - Good morning, my love. We were just talking about you. - Val, without interruption from your wonderful partner here, I need to ask you a very serious question. Tell me what happened to the coffee table before your friend here broke the door. - He was asking for it, sir. It was completely self-defense. - See. - And Miller here. He had to throw him through the table. - I had to. Thank you, Val. - You two are dismissed. - Okay. But I expect to see you at the party, right? - You think you're still coming after all this? You think you're invited? - Yeah, I mean, it's New Years. Why would I not come? And besides, we got to bring in the New Years together. And I expect my kiss at midnight. (lips smacking) (Val clears throat) - I'm working on him, Captain. - (sighs) Miller is gonna drive me crazy one day. (computer keys clicking) - You know, I'm getting really sick of covering for you. - Covering for me, you threw me under the bus. I had it covered. I told Captain that me and the perp were dancing. - Huh. - Yeah, like next time tell Captain you forgot, or you plead the fifth, plead the fifth. - Or how about you just start behaving so I don't have to cover for you so much? Ridiculous. - Come on, where's the fun in that? (upbeat jazz music) Hey Tom, is that work you're doing? - Yes. - Are you sure? Because if not, you might get fired. Terminated, kicked out. Might have to drag all your stuff out your desk. - Well, I do not need to worry about that. I am in fact working on business, that's my job. - Man, your job boring as hell. - Filing is, especially during this transition period. - You gotta put all these files in the computer? - Yes, yes. And I have them in a very specific order. I can't have you mixing things up. - [Miller] All right. - Tom, how's your mama doing? - She's doing all right, hanging in there. Thanks for asking, Val. - Yeah. - He lives with his mom? Yo, how is it living with your mother? Isn't that kind of hard when you're trying to like meet anime girls and stuff online. Like can't have your mom's walking in, while you're trying to get some tail, right? - Well, Tom, it's been a pleasure, but we've got to go. Hopefully you'll be at the party later. - Oh, I don't think I can make it. - Aw, Tom can't make the party. We can't have a party without Tom! - You'll figure it out, Miller. - Aw, all right. - Bye. - So long, Tommy. Catch you at your Mama's. (upbeat jazz music) - Asshole. - What, what, come on, whoa, hey, come on, hey. Like you just can't be putting your hands on me, though I am sexy. That's like borderline sexual harassment. - You wish. - I do wish, I wish that we can date. Like we should be a thing. Why are we not making this happen, what's happening? - Well, two reasons is, one, we're partners, and I don't like to mix business and pleasure. And secondly, you are an asshole. - Ow, I'm not an asshole. I'm awesome. - You are an asshole, and I think you hurt Tom's feelings. - Really, Tom, like, he'll... He'll be fine, he's a rock. - You know, he's the only guy that tries to come to work and not mess with anyone and go home at the end of the day? He doesn't cut corners, he's a good cop. Just leave him alone. - Okay, then maybe he should try fitting in more, all right? He's so awkward. - Just be nicer to him please? - Really, I mean, he lives with his mother. Don't you think that's a little bit odd? Him living with his mom, a grown man? - You know that he takes care of her, she has problems. - Her problem is that her grown son is living with her and mooching off her. That's her problem. - Mm, and where do you get this information from? - I'm a detective. I detect shit. - Okay, Mr. Detective, you know that he supports her financially. And he's just a good guy, like help me out. Just lay off of Tom for a little bit. - All right, I'll lay off Tom. - Good. - We cool? - We're cool. - All right. - Let's get to work. - Fine, you win. (suspenseful music) (flames crackling) - What's that noise, what's going on? Officer, what's happening, what's going on? - [Officer] Drug usage is against the law. Oh my God, look at this. That's not mine, officer. That's not mine, officer. That must've been here before me. And I just didn't notice. - [Officer] Loitering is against the law. - Loitering, I'll tell you, sir. The shelter had no beds left tonight. So where am I supposed to go, where? - Get up! - Ah man. - You can't stay here. - Oh, come on, man. Are you kidding me, I was sound asleep. This is beautiful. Aw, man! - Put your hands around your back. - Oh man, come on. (dramatic whooshing) Hey man, aren't you supposed to tell me your rights? Come on, tell me your rights! - You have the right to remain silent! (man groans) (suspenseful music) (man screams) (suspenseful music) (computer keys clicking) (hand knocking) - Come in. Mary Lewis, how are you doing today? - Good morning, Captain. I'm doing well, sir, thank you for asking. - Everyone comes here like this on their first day. - Like what, sir? - Like that. All business, all professional. - Is that a bad thing? - No, actually it's quite refreshing. You come right out of the academy and everything you've learned, you learned from a book. You learn what to do, you learn how to write it up. But knowing what to do is different than seeing the real thing. - I understand that, sir. - You'll understand that around here, the city has fallen apart over the years. When I was a kid, I used to walk the streets at night. My parents used to leave their doors unlocked, but now you'd be inviting some crackhead in to rob you blind or even worse. - Hopefully I can help make the city a better place. - (laughs) I like your enthusiasm. Now, let me see. Cooper, come to my office, please. I'm teaming you up with Cooper, learn from him. He and I go way back. He'll show you the ropes. And if you follow his example, you won't have any issues around here. - Yes, sir, I will do just that, sir. - [Cooper] Captain. - Cooper. This is Lewis. She's your new beautiful partner. - Ah, nice to meet you, Officer Lewis. - Nice to meet you as well. Look forward to working with you. - Oh, and you should be afraid, be very afraid. Captain tell you what happened to my last partner? - No, what happened? - He retired! (laughs) All right, Lewis, let's go, come on. - Thank you, Captain. - Oh, did you cancel the party yet? - What is that? - The New Year's Party. You heard what the governor said, right? - As a matter of fact, I didn't. - He's limiting all parties to just 10 people. - That fat son of a bitch! Did he give a reason? - Yeah, last year, the big party in LA. - The one we broke up. - Yeah, the one where his son got arrested. Fact, wasn't it his son that was bankrolling that thing? - That corrupt blob. So, it looks like my hands are tied, doesn't it? I have to cancel. - Or if you just follow the rules and just keep it small. You know, how I do enjoy these gatherings. - All right, all right. I'll figure something out. Cooper, thanks for the information. - Captain. Okay, Lewis, let's get coffee. (computer keys clicking) - Oh, ouch. So, I am going to detect that old stubby over here did not die of natural causes. - What happened? - It's bad, never seen anything like this. I'm having a hard time explaining it. - Try harder. His throat was torn. His arms were ripped out of his shoulder sockets. It looks like an animal attack, but what kind of animal are we talking about? - Sasquatch, easily. - Hey, you don't need to be here, Miller. - Oh yeah, I do. First of all, I'm an expert on Sasquatches. Wrote a book report in third grade. Secondly, Captain says I gotta be here for all of this dead homeless guy mess because I could detect stuff, I can solve the case. - Look, can you tell us what happened to him or not? - He was butchered. Whatever did this to him was strong, superhuman strong. Must've had some claws that cut through his neck like a knife through butter. You ask me what happened? My answer, I don't know what the hell happened. - Don't worry, stubby, we'll figure it out. (birds chirp) - So why'd you become a cop? - Oh, same reason most people do, I guess. Saw that there was a lot of wrong, and I wanted to be part of the solution. But didn't think it'd become a career. Here I am, here you are. What about you? - My dad was a cop. My dad's dad was a cop. Of course they were hoping for a boy to carry out the family tradition, but they got me. - But you're carrying it on though. - Believe it or not, they didn't want me to. - Why not? - Well, my dad's behind the times quite a bit. He doesn't think that women should even be officers. - Ah, barefoot and pregnant then. - More or less, I guess. He kept trying to convince me to go to college and become a teacher, but this is in my blood. - Yeah, you have it in your eyes. I see it. Your dad will come around, I'm sure. - I wouldn't bet on it. So, things must get pretty crazy around here on New Year's Eve, right? - Yeah, it's a circus. The clowns come out, especially when that ball is about to drive. - You think the restrictions are gonna make it less of a pain in the ass? - Oh my God, it's gonna make it worse. Because now you're gonna have these Karens. They're gonna report their neighbors when there's 11 people instead of 10. Phones are gonna be ringing off the hook. But we should be pretty much in the clear. The guys in the graveyard shift will have to deal with that bullshit. - Well, what's this I hear about an office party? - Ah, don't get your hopes up too high. Captain throws it every year, and every year it gets bigger and more impressive. It's been a tradition since the '50s. You know, people, booze, dancing, laughing. But with the new restrictions, I believe it'll be canceled this year. - Bummer. - Yeah. (somber music) - Thanks again for that coffee, so next one's on me. - You owe me, Lewis. - Yeah. (man mutters) (dramatic music) (man mutters) - Hey! - No, don't kill me! Don't kill me. - What's your problem, sir? - Don't kill me, Satan, don't hurt me. Help me. - That's really nice to know. (suspenseful music) (man groans) Come on, let's go, let's go. (suspenseful music) Come on, come on. - I saw him! I tell you, I saw him. I saw him! - Shut up! - It was a demon and I saw him. - Come here, come here. Get a grip on yourself, come here. Come here, you sit down right here. - Oh, please help me, help me. - Ah, shit, it's too early for that. Really, do your job, bro, right now. Who the hell are you? - Oh, I'm officer Lewis, sir. - Oh, Officer Lewis. So, you brought loud mouth in with Cooper over here, okay. Why don't you grab him, put him in the drunk tank with the rest of them? It's just too early for this shit. - What did he do? - Oh, he reached for Cooper's gun and called him Satan. (Miller laughs) - This guy reached for his gun, called you Satan. Aw, Cooper. - Fuck you, Miller. - Hey man, later. (moans) - Gus? - Gus? What, you know this guy? - Yeah, I volunteer down at the shelter. And Gus here's my boy. What's up man, what happened? - I saw him, Val. I saw him. - You saw who? - The devil. I mean the cop, it was a cop and he was the devil! - I don't think I'm quite following you, hon. Can you take a deep breath and try again? - I'll tell you. He killed Kevin. Val, he killed Kevin! - So you mean a cop killed Kevin? - Well, he looked like a cop, but he was actually the devil himself! - Okay, so this guy's like so drunk. Put him in the back. I mean, it's too early for this, y'all, knock this out. Homeless people always have crazy ass stories, guys. - Shh, what did he look like? - He wasn't human. He was not human, Val. He was a demon, I tell you! He was a demon, a demon, a demon! - Okay, look. I'm gonna get back to my desk and get some actual work done. Deal with this fool, okay? Chop, chop. (suspenseful music) (Captain sighs softly) (suspenseful music) (dramatic whooshing) (heels clack) (man groans) - Tonight is the night. (eerie music) We've been waiting for you. We asked the master to send us the ultimate sacrifice. Ah yes, and here you are. - You people are sick. (woman laughs) - I can look in your eyes. Oh, I see into your soul. (tongue clicks) You are so lost. Ooh, you're part of our family now. - I give you my word. If you let me go, you will not be in trouble. - You're not telling the truth, Officer. Let me ask you this? What has your law ever done for you, hm? (chuckles) Nothing. You risk your life day in and day out. And what do you get in return, huh? I can't hear you. Nothing. We can offer you so much more. (man groans) (woman moans) - Mm, that's nice, so nice. You see, it was meant to be. (eerie music) - I don't want this and I don't want you. I don't want this goddamn cult. - Honey. We will take care of you. Officer. (Officer groans) Where, oh, where is your partner, hm? - I'm alone. - No, you're not. Alone here, I know you're not alone. - I am. - No, you're not. No, you're not alone. - I am. - No, you're not. - I'm alone. - You travel like wolves. (woman imitating wolves howling) Where is he? - I told you before, I am alone. - Mm-hmm. - You don't know what you're doing, lady. I'm a police officer. Do you know what they do to cop killers? - (gasps) Oh! Oh, kill you? I don't want to kill you. (Officer groans) Now. Ch, ch, ch. There is a way out of this, Officer. All you have to do is submit. (officer screams) No, it's all right, it's all right. All you have to do is submit. (Officer whimpers) (ax squelches) (Officer screams) (flesh tears) (eerie music) We sacrifice you at the feet of Moloch, god of prosperity, god of sacrifice. We give you and your soul, we give your life to the king. To the taker of souls. (Officer gags) (liquid gargles) Now. (woman moans) What is it you will say? (Officer groans) (acolyte shouts) (gunshots blasting) (bodies thudding) (heels clack) (eerie music) (Officer growls) - Wilson? - You put your gun down. I can't be killed. - What the hell happened to you, Wilson? (Wilson laughs) What happened to you? - I can't be killed, but I'll be back. And when I return, this city will burn! (Wilson laughs) - No, Wilson. (dramatic whooshing) (suspenseful music) - Yo, Captain, what's up? - Nothing. - Come on, bullshit, something got into you. Was that nonsense that dude was screaming about demons and stuff, did that scare you? You okay? - Listen, I'm having a bad day, Miller. Okay, I'm overwhelmed with bullshit. I need a vacation, okay? That's what's going on. - You sure? It's like 70 degrees out here and it's like, you're sweating bullets. Like if there's something serious going on, we can talk about it, okay? - Just remember I'm your boss, okay, Miller? I don't answer to you. - Okay. - Now, just leave my office and do it now. - All right, all right. Later, Cap. (Captain sighs) (woman laughs) (objects clattering) (Miller whistles) - Excuse me. (groans) Lunch. - Okay. - Okay, what? - How long have we known each other for? - Hmm, 15 years maybe? - Yeah, 15 years. And in that amount of time, have we ever broken bread together? - Oh, never 'cause I don't eat bread, bread's disgusting. Too much gluten, too many carbs. Did you know I was actually fat when I was a kid? People used to make fun of me all the time. Broke my heart, hurt my feelings, it was crazy. - Okay, okay, calm down, just making a joke, have a seat. Don't go get a hard-on. - You know, Miller. You bring out many reactions out of me, but a hard-on isn't one of 'em. - (gasps) I don't make you horny? Appear I'm not his type. Sad, sad face. - Okay, you want to get to your point? You're really starting to spoil my lunch here. - Hear me out, I was thinking about it, right? I mean, you've known me for at least 15 years, and you've known Captain for even longer, right? - Okay. - So if anybody else here would know Captain it's you, like, you're like the best, right? - Yeah, probably, so cut to the chase. - Hear me out. I mean, I don't know, that's why I'm asking you. If something was wrong with Captain, you would know about it. - What do you think he's hiding? - Fuck if I know. Once bummy over here started talking about demons and angels and all that nonsense, Captain flew out here like a bat out of hell, right? - Can you stop that? - Stop what? - Calling a guy that's down on his luck a bum. It's not right, Miller. - What, you one of those bleeding heart liberals I've been hearing so much about? - You can call me what you want, but I believe everyone deserves respect. - This guy reached for your gun. - Yeah, but he's also not all there. I mean, can you imagine sleeping on those lonely streets? (sighs) I mean, it kicks the hell out of you. In fact, I want Gus to get help. And why is he locked up down there anyway? - Oh, what are you now, Captain save a hobo? Come on. Okay, wait, come on, have a seat, have a seat. Just hear me out, okay? I'm just trying to figure out why did the captain leave after hearing the bum's story, okay? - Okay. I've known the captain for as long as I've been here. How well do you think you know somebody, right? They only reveal what they want to reveal. How well do you think you really know somebody? How well do you think I know that the captain is hiding something? I don't know. I don't know much. Sorry to disappoint. (chair legs scrape) - Jesus. Some detective that guy is, right? So Gus, my favorite homeless person, how are ya? - Okay, sir. - No, don't call me, sir. Please call me Detective Miller. I mean, I know I'm not as sexy as Val or adorable as Lewis over here. And I definitely don't have that hot Asian, sexy thing going on the way, you know, Tom does, but I'm okay. We can be kind of formal. - (clears throat) Okay, I think lunch is over. - So, Gus, tell me about this whole demon thing. I mean, is this real or is this just kind of like just an imaginary figure, kind of living at the bottom of your favorite bottle? - I know you don't believe me. - No, hear me out. I am a very thorough, well documented detective. I do all of my work as focused as possible, right? So, let me get all your information. Tell me what you saw, and I can figure it out. - Look at me. Are you looking at me? - Yeah. - [Gus] And what do you see? - Is this kind of like a whole hot or not type of thing? 'Cause I'm thinking not. Accurate or not accurate? - You're crazy. You're ridiculous. - You're not a very good detective, are you? Always making jokes. You expect me to tell you something, but you don't take anything serious. - I mean, you've been here a long time, right? You've gotten some free food, place to stay. You got some sandwiches. You probably want some desserts now, right? So she gonna get me some cookies, some puddings, some cakes. I'm gonna give that to you, you tell me what happened. What? - We talked about this. - About what? - About you being an asshole. Gus, all right, we're really trying here, okay? Now can you tell us everything you know about this guy? It's our only way to help keep you and your friends safe. - I am sober now. - Good, that's good. - That's what I was trying to tell this idiot detective here. I'm thinking clearly now. I know what I saw, Val. I know it. I know that it was real, but everything I know seems to tell me that it couldn't be real. - Just try to tell us whatever you can remember. We've really gotta get this guy. - It wasn't a guy, Val. It wasn't a guy. - Then what was it? - (sighs) I don't know. But whatever it was, it crawled straight out of hell! - Okay, all right. You hear that, see? I got it figured out. All we gotta do is get like some pickaxes and some shovels and we just keep digging till it gets hot, real warm, right? And then we go down, down to hell. - You think I'm a bum. - Yeah. - Well, maybe I am. But I don't need you to be judging me, so don't do it. - So cut the bullshit, what did you see? - I saw the devil himself! I saw Satan. (thunder cracks) And believe me, what I saw wasn't good. He killed, and he is ready to kill again. Listen to me, buddy boy! He's not done. He's got plenty more to do. - Really, really? I mean, I didn't expect much from you, rookie, but, Val, you just gonna let him grab me like this? - Gus, then why wouldn't he kill you? - Because he needed a messenger. I've thought about it and I'm sure I'm right, that's it. He needs a messenger. I think he's coming here. - Okay, great. I mean he was already dressed like a cop, so he would come here, that makes sense, right? - You need to learn it the hard way, don't you? - You know what, I've had enough of your bullshit. - All right, I will shut up. And I'll let you deal with whatever this is in your own way. - Hey, okay, okay. Everyone, we need to relax here. Gus, you've had a really tough night, it's very obvious. And your day is not getting any better, okay? Why don't we go on a walk, take that anxiety, put it outside for a little while. And you need to chill out. - I am. - I'm not even going to say anything. - Thank you, Wilson. Val. Sorry for being so strange in my behavior earlier. - No, don't be, it's okay. - No, I am, I am. I have a lot on my mind. You may or you may not know, I separated from my wife. I've been forging through here. - I'm sorry about that, Captain. - It's okay, it's okay. I'm just looking at having a time to let loose some steam. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - So, tonight we're having a party. Well, a party, but not as big as it used to be, but we're having a party tonight. - You know it's okay if we don't have it. - No, I need this, and you can come too. - Okay. - Val, can you get him some fresh clothing? - Yeah. Come on, Gus, let's go get you all balled up for the party. Thank you. - Thank you. (upbeat rock music) (glasses clink) (upbeat rock music) - Go ahead, rookie. You clean up pretty nicely. - You can call me Mary. - (laughs) All right, Mary. Why are you being so nice to me? - Because Cooper says you're all right. I mean, you just come off as a total a-hole. - (laughs) All right. Okay, maybe I'll start being a little bit nicer to Cooper. And stop talking about him behind his back. - That might be a good idea, yeah. ♪ Can't go back, though I try ♪ - How do you do it? - Do what? - Stay partners with the biggest asshole the department's ever seen? - What can I say, I've always been pretty patient. - Obviously. - You are insecure, Miller. (Miller laughs) You are so insecure. - Really? - Yes. - What makes you say that? - Because I mean, I know you cover everything up with jokes. You try to be funny. And if people pressure you, they will find out you're not as confident as you appear to be. (Val laughs) - You know what, I already see a fault in that theory. - Oh yeah? - Yes. - How's that? - Well, one, I don't try to be funny, I just am. And, two, not too many people laugh at my jokes anyway. So don't make a difference. - Oh my God. - You know, I'm beginning to think that marriage and being a cop don't really coincide. - That's true, Val. That's true. No, they don't. (glasses clink) - So, you having a good time tonight, Tom? - Yes, sir. Thank you for inviting me, I don't go to many parties. - Why not? - I have to take care of my mother. - You could have brought her along for the party. We would have still been within state requirements. - I thought it would be weird to bring her along. - I mean, you could have brought a girlfriend along with you too, Tom. - I don't have a girlfriend. - Why not? - It's a long story. - I'm all ears. - Nobody will date me. - That doesn't sound like a very long story to me. (Val laughs) - Hey, you think I should go ask the captain to dance? - Oh, sick of me already? - No, not at all. He's just over there with Tom and Gus. - No chance of them dancing together? It'd be a trio of love. - I think the chances are pretty slim on that one. Besides I think the captain could use some female attention after his breakup, I feel bad. - Well, I guess that leaves me with Gus and Tom. - Sorry. - Okay. Yeah, it's all right. I'm sure one of them can suck a bowling ball off a garden hose. - You are too much. Gimme that. - Okay, Val. Lewis! (suspenseful music) - Is there anybody there? (suspenseful music) (cop shouts) (Wilson growls) ♪ It's about time laying stuff ♪ ♪ It's already New Year's time ♪ (Wilson growling) (blood spurting) ♪ And sometime I call your friends ♪ ♪ And have 'em come and bring wine ♪ Hey, Cap, Cap, yo, this is a great party. This is awesome and you know what? We need to hire more beautiful cops like Lewis over here. Like with handcuffs and like uniform and all that, man. I'm telling you, it's gonna be a great year. - I'm so sorry, Lewis. You see Miller gets a lot worse once he drinks, Miller. - I don't mind, Captain. I mean, I know I'm not bad to look at. - No, she is definitely not bad to look at. Especially in that dress. (dramatic whooshing) (suspenseful music) (Wilson shouts) (objects crash) (Wilson grunts) (objects crash) (book thuds) (somber music) (Wilson screams) - Vincent! (Wilson mutters) - That's a fine dress, I like the dress. I like the, hey, hey, it's my partner. How you doin'? - Keep it in your pants, Miller. - It's in my pants. This is a party, it's not an orgy. Yet. (Lewis laughs) (Miller laughs) - You need to keep that nonsense in check! - What? I'm sorry, Tom, you got something to say to me? I upset you. - You walk around this place like you are hot shit. (slow dance music) - Well, since nobody is gonna say it, I will. You are a child and a joke! - Tom, that's such a mean thing to say to me. Like you really hurt my feelings. Make me feel better, give me a lap dance, bow, bow, bow! - See, that's what I'm talking about! - (laughs) What are you talking about? What are you upset about, huh? I mean, you brought it up first. I want a lap dance too, that's what you're talking about? Let's talk about it, bow, bow, bow, come on, come on. - Don't encourage him. (Lewis laughs) Miller, I'm telling you this as a fellow law enforcement agent. You need to treat people better and honor the fairer sex. - You know what, I got a serious question. Serious question, okay. That way I can get to know a little bit more about you, all right? Okay, can I ask you a serious question? Okay, all right? Is your mom hot? Like 'cause if I know she's hot, I can come over sometime. I can come over and holler at her, like we can make out. I can be your stepdad, Tom. - Miller. - Why would you do that? - I can be your stepdad. Come on, Tom, what? - You are too much. - No, I'm just enough. - No. - Oh, lap dance time. - I need to pee. - No, send me a video. - You're sick. (laughs) - A little bit, yeah. Okay. (grunts) I'll be waiting. What, what? - A little young for you, isn't she? - A little young for me? I distinctly remember me saying to you that we should date and you said no. Are you jealous? - Not at all. - Yes, you are. You is a jealous old lady! I get all the young girls. You had your chance! (suspenseful music) (footsteps patter) (cup rattles) (cup rattles) (suspenseful music) (footsteps patter) (hand taps) - Hey, anybody in here? (hand taps) (hand taps) All right. - Ah, man. It's not like how it used to be, is it? - Never really is, is it? - You think Captain is gonna throw another party sometime? - I don't know. The way the world's going these days. The rats that run the show kinda just wanna keep us locked up and quiet. The world is just weird. - You know what we should do next year? - What? - Check it, we should rent a huge mansion in the middle of nowhere, right? Just us, some cool people, hire a DJ. Plenty of food, open bar. Big booty strippers, it'd be great. You know what I'm saying? We should do all of that, be our little secret. - Okay, and you're gonna pay for all that? - (laughs) Hell now, not on my cop salary. I'll tell you one thing, though, if I did pay for it, you can't be bringing your homeless homeboys over here. Like I'm being serious, why is he even here? Are you trying to give him a reward for pulling Cooper's gun? Like you know if you keep coddling them, they're going to grow up bad, right? - You know, he's older than us, right? - Yeah, he's like a dinosaur. That's beside the point though. - Just leave him alone. - Stop babying him. Speaking of babies, where's Lewis? I'm trying to hit that. - (groans) You know you've got no chance with her, right? - Are you kidding me? She was all over me. She was literally about to give me a lap dance before she peed on me. (dramatic whooshing) - Miller. (Lewis groans) Basically all the stalls? (hand bangs) Hey. That's it. Gotta go, gotta go, oh! (suspenseful music) (Lewis moans) (suspenseful music) What the fuck? (Wilson grunts) - So, you guys think Lewis is working here? You guys like her? (Wilson grunts) - She's doing good. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, she's a gamer. She was out there helping me with Gus. (laughs) (Wilson growls) - She was about to do a great lap dance. I don't know what happened. (Wilson growls) (head thuds) (men laugh) - She's my partner. (Wilson growls) - But no, seriously though. We need more good cops like her so I'm glad that you got her on. - Yeah, she's good. I'm glad you guys like her. - She left a while ago. It's almost midnight, I haven't seen her in a minute. - You know what, yeah, I'll go check on her, okay? - All right. - Then go ahead, right, do that. - All right, all right, all right. (hands clap) - Send her my way when you get done checking on her. Ow, ow, ow. - I'm not following you. - It's wild, they're like scavenger hunts for adults. You get the hints online and if you manage to figure it all out, you get a prize. - What kind of a prize? - Gift cards, action figures. Just a symbol that you outsmarted the other players. - (chuckles) And you like this. - Sure. You don't think it sounds like fun? - (laughs) Tom, my idea of fun is making enough money to be able to afford one night in a cheap hotel. - How did you end up on the streets? You seem far too smart for it. - I'm a victim of circumstance. I had a good job, I had a house. I went overseas, I couldn't find a job. I lost everything. I lost my house, I lost my wife. I lost myself at the bottom of a bottle. Boom, street life. (sighs) You know, I'm glad I'm here now. Kind of makes me feel a little bit normal again. - What's gonna happen after tonight? It's New Year's Eve. What's your resolution? - (laughs) I'm going to try to get myself together. (suspenseful music) - Lewis! (hand knocks) Lewis? You in here? Okay. Lewis, you're missing the party, Lewis. Lewis, Lewis, Lewis. (hand knocks) Lewis, you in there? Lewis. What the fuck? Oh my God! (Cooper panting) What the fuck? I'm sorry. (suspenseful music) (Cooper shouts) Officer, officer, come down here! Come here, come on! Don't you hear me? Come on! Jesus! - I'm hoping that once everything's over. (Cooper shouts) - We have a killer in the house. - What do you mean? - What the hell do you think I mean? There's a crazy son of a bitch in a cop uniform! He just killed Lewis! - What, Joe Lewis? - Oh my God! - Are you sure? - He butchered her. Captain, we gotta get armed. We gotta take this son of a bitch down. - I think we all need to take a breather here, okay? We should call for backup and figure this out. - This guy just killed Lewis. No, there it is again, are you scared? - What are you talking about? - You are scared. Look, let's go to the armory, get some weapons, find this guy and put a fucking hole in him! - I'm with Miller! - He killed my partner. - He's dressed like a cop damn it. Stand down, Miller! - Aren't you gonna go with them? - I'm with the captain. Let them call for backup and let them handle it. - I don't think that's quite what he had in mind. (dramatic whooshing) - Okay, what are we looking for, Cooper? - (sighs) Gus was right. Whatever he is, he's not human. - Whatever he is, I'm sending him back to hell. - Why here, why is he here? - Maybe he heard we were having a killer party. (dramatic music) (Tom grunts) - Son of a bitch. (grunts) Why the fuck is this door locked? - Well, they do lock it at night. - Not from the inside. Somebody must've locked it from the outside. - Maybe he wants us to stay. - Oh, fuck that. (grunts) Stick with me, Gus. Gus? Oh, come on, Gus. Where are you? (suspenseful music) (Tom gasps) (Tom retches) (Wilson chuckles) (body slides) - They insult you and you take it. - What? - They laugh at you, Thomas, all of them. They think you're one big joke. Why do you allow this? - There, there really is nothing I can do. - What if I told you I can make it so that no one will make fun of you ever again? In fact, you will strike fear in their hearts every second they exist. - What do I have to do? (Wilson laughs) (suspenseful music) (Tom groans) (Wilson growls) (Tom groans loudly) (Wilson growls) - [Cooper] Captain knows something. - I'm gonna change his diaper later. We gotta catch this guy and take him down. - I hate party crashers. - Makes two of us. (suspenseful music) Here, take this. - Thanks. - So, where are the other two? - I sent them home. - You sent them home? Why, we could have used those guys. - No, no, it's okay. I need to get Gus out of here, and he was the only way I was sure it was gonna happen. - Man, whatever. - Listen, everyone, we stick together. We go floor by floor, room by room. and we hunt this mother fucker down, end him! Any questions? - No. - Hey, it's Tom. Yo, Tom, get in here, get a weapon, quick. - Tom, come here, I got something for you. Tom. Get your shit out here, Tom. Tom, wake up. (suspenseful music) Oh shit. Tom is smiling, and I've never seen Tom smile before. - I don't think I ever wanna see him smile again. There's something wrong with him. - Tom, what the hell happened to you? (Tom screeches) - [Captain] Tom, top right there, Tom. Stop right there. (Tom growls) Tom. (Tom growls) - Captain! (suspenseful music) Oh my gosh, that's what I saw, that's him! - That's the guy? (Tom chuckles) - Shut the fuck up! (gunshots blast) (Wilson laughs) (Wilson growls) (gunshots blast) - Hey, asshole! (rifle blasts) (gunshots blasting) (Wilson growls) (gunshot blasts) - This isn't working, guys, we need to regroup. - Uh, yeah. - This isn't working. - Let's go, let's go, move, move, move! - Captain, come on. - Cap, get up, come on! Let's go. - Go! (people chatter) (Wilson growls) (suspenseful music) (footsteps patter) Come on! - Come on, come on. (door slams) (table rattles) (people panting) (Cooper coughing) - All right, now I know I've been a prick to Tom, but him trying to kill us, not cool. - What's on your mind, Captain? - Nothing. I'm just getting my thoughts together. - Getting your thoughts together? Captain, you knew something was going on when her hobo boyfriend brought that dude in there talking about some demon cop stuff. You know what's going on, spill the beans. - Hell, I know hell. - Tell us! - 20 years ago, I wasn't a captain. I was a cop. I had a partner named Wilson. He died in a warehouse fire. - I remember that. - You remember the story I told. You remember how we ran in there, I barely got out. Wilson died in the line of duty. My life went on. He died and the truth died with him. I've lived with it all this time. And here is it, here is it coming back to bite me. - What really happened that night? - We got a call there was something happening at the Anderson warehouse on Main Street. We get there, and we hear chanting. Muffled chanting. I didn't know what the hell it was. We sneak around to the back of the building. We found our way in. We walk through the darkness and we follow the sound. I couldn't believe what I saw. People in red robes. - Satanists. - I guess. I don't know what the hell they worshiped, but there was more going on that night than just worship. - Tell us, Captain! (suspenseful music) - They were sacrificing children that night. - What? - Oh my God. - I know. I freaked out, I ran. Wilson didn't. They tortured that man. They found and tortured that man. (dramatic music) I was so goddamn weak by the time I got back to the squad car, I couldn't even make the call for backup. And before I knew it, the place was engulfed in flames. I found the courage to go back in and try to save my partner. I saw him, I saw him. They crucified him. But his eyes were blood red, and his face... His face, oh God. He was in such pain. I couldn't reach him so I left and before I knew it, I was being brought back to the car by the fire brigade that saw the flames. I'm lucky to be alive, but I should've been there to help save my partner. - Let me get this straight? You're trying to say that thing out there is your old partner? - I know it is. He sold his soul that night to the devil. He sold his soul to end the pain he was in. He sold his soul to seek revenge on me, on our city and on the force. But I knew this day would come. - Okay, so Cap's ex partner is a zombie trying to kill us. He's made Tom his bitch. All good information, but how do we kill him! Because this isn't working! - I think it just has to run its course. - Run its course? - It's best we just step aside and let the storm pass. - How do we take this guy out? - Captain, you're still the same coward you were that night. We were hired to serve and protect the public! We take this thing down now! - Yes. - You're right. You're goddamn right. (footsteps patter) - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. - Uh, you know we're not supposed to use those anymore. - Desperate times call for desperate measures. - The other door. - All right. (gun cocks) Do you want what's behind door number one or number two? - (sighs) I'm gonna go with door number one. - I'm here, Wilson! I'm here, and I'm not running from you anymore. You hear me? You want me? You want this over? Let's end it then. You and me, one-on-one! (dramatic whooshing) - Yeah. - Holy. (Tom growls) Tom, hey, man. (Tom growls) I'm sorry about your mom, I hope we're cool about that. (hand smacks) (Miller groans) - Tom, stop right there. - You whore! - Tom, stop! - You're nothing but a two-faced whore! (gun clicks) - Tom, I know you're in there, just calm down. - Tom is dead! (Tom grunts) (Val shouts) (Miller grunts) (Tom groans) - Hey, Tom. You're fired! (rifle blasts) (body thuds) (Val groans) - You okay? - Yeah, come on! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. - He's dead, what are you waiting for? - Jump scare. - What's a jump scare? (Tom growls) (rifle blasts) - I told you, jump scare. - Come on! (suspenseful music) - We're here, Captain. We got your back, come on. - [Wilson] That doesn't look like one-on-one to me, Vincent. - Get the fuck outta here! - No! - Both of you, out! Get outta here, this is my war. - Captain, you're not alone, we got you. - This is my war. This is my destiny! In one way or another, it ends tonight. - We got your back. - I'm not leaving. - This is not a request, it's a damn order! Now get out! - Come on. - Out! - [Cooper] We're backing you up. - Out. - I'm leaving. - Okay. - Get outta here! - [Cooper] Okay. (door slams) - Bitch! I'm ready. (Wilson laughs) - Oh, I did not even think you'd show your face, Vincent. - Sorry what happened to you. I know I fucked up. I know I fucked up, Wilson, but this didn't have to happen. Nobody needed to die. - Well, uh, you're right. But I didn't kill them, you did. - No, you did, you son of a bitch! You killed 'em! - No, you did. If you had answered my call, you could've settled it then. But in order to get your attention, I had to spill some blood. And even with that, you still hid? (tongue clicks) How shameful of a captain. (laughs) - What do you want from me? You want my blood? - That's a start. - So, kill me then. If that's what it takes, end it now. - And you think death is enough? I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to feel the pain that I felt. - Then do it, okay? - And when you scream and scream some more, you will die. - Then I guess it'd be all over, Wilson. - It won't be over. You see, I've come to like killing. I'm going to send this entire world to hell. Shh, starting with you, Vincent. (laughs) Let me remind you why I'm here, Vincent. You know what this is? You let me burn. (gasoline splashes) You ran and you hid, and you let me burn. Now, I'm gonna return the favor. Now. (suspenseful music) You're going to experience pain like you've never imagined, Vincent. (laughs) You ready to die? - No! (men grunting) (objects crash) (Wilson laughs) (chair shatters) - Whoa, Vincent, I didn't know you had this fight in you! (hands clap) Quite impressive. (laughs) I'm going to regret ending you. You are quite amusing. (laughs) Are you ready to die? Oh, wow, you've got your little toy. Bring it. - Die, you bastard! (weapon blasts) (Wilson shouts) (fireworks blasting) (fireworks whooshing) (fireworks popping) - (sighs) It's over. It's over. - Yeah, and it's a new year. What a way to start it. - Yeah. (Cooper sighs) (chain rattles) - Clawson. - Oh shit. - You're talking a lot of bullshit. I want the truth. I don't want to hear some lame bullshit you three stooges conjured up. We have dead bodies, you got that? And the truth will come out. I'll make sure of it. (heels clack) - Happy New Year. - You're welcome. (men laugh) The truth's gonna come out? They ain't gonna believe this shit. - They'll have their own version of it, but I tell you it's not gonna be real. Hell, I don't even think this was real. - I need a shower and a drink. - I'll take you out for drinks. I mean, we're alive. - Oh please, I'm sweaty, I'm a hot mess. I look like shit. You still want to take me out now, Mr. Miller? - Of course, Val. To me, you're beautiful. - And besides, I like my girls sweaty, cranky, looking like shit. It's kind of a fetish for me. - Get over here. (lips smacking) - Uh, hey now. Okay, you two. - We're alive, let's get outta here. - Hey, you two take care, all right? See you soon. - Bye. (somber music) - We were good to night. - [Miller] Great. - Scumbags think I'm an idiot. Do I look like I was born yesterday? Demon. (laughs) Give me a break. What a load of fucking shit. (suspenseful music) - Unbelievable, isn't it?
