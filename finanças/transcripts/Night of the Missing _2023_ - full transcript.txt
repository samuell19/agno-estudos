Uh, that's all I know. -She say anything else? -Well, not that I can... Sheriff, I... I'm telling you... One minute I'm mopping the floors in the cells and then the next... Well, I don't think I'm ever gonna get what I seen tonight out of my sight, ma'am. No. No, ma'am. - All right. You take it easy. -What do you think is wrong with her? -You go on home now. I'll get to the bottom of this. It'll be all right. By morning, everything will be right-- Well, it'll be right, is all. -Oh. Yes, ma'am. You have yourself a good night, now. -Mm. You do the same. Good night. Winston. You tell that wife of yours those cookies she made for the officers and me... downright perfection. -You enjoyed it then? -Didn't survive the night. Seems like you've had yourself quite the night, from the looks of you. Miss? Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? Umbrella? Too late for that, huh? -Nothing for me. Thanks. -All right. -What's this? -This... is for the guilty. Those who have something to panic about. Well, now that you've scared my custodian half to death-- I doubt he'll ever sleep again-- why don't you tell me what you're here to report? -I'm here to report a missing person. - All right. I'm listening. Who's that? -So many. Tell me. Have you found any of them? -Hundred thousand people go missing every year. Some of them disappear without a trace. -Vanished. -Sometimes. -Little Joey Gonzalez. Poor thing. -You knew him? I can still hear the music coming around the way. And the echoes of spare change shaking in his pockets. They say he got too close. -Too close to what? -Can you hear it? -Mom! Mom, the-- there's no more ice cream. No sweets before dinner. I want ice cream. I don't have any money. Could I go ask my...? Can you hear it? Do you expect me to believe that story? -Little Joey believed, didn't he? -Miss, are you ready to tell me who you're here to report? -Tammy. -What's that? -A classic case of mistaken identity. And a voice. A stranger. Who called a girl. Named Tammy. You never know who's on the other end of the line. I feel like I haven't heard your voice in... God, I don't even know anymore. Where are you, baby? I miss you, that's all. We all do. If you can hear this, please, come home. I hope you're okay. Wherever you are. I love you. Always. Okay. Good night. -Good night, Mom. -Next. -Take it off. Take it all off. -Nope. Everybody's body. You can choose anything.

Yeah. -You there, loverboy? Hello? Don't get shy on me now, lover. Ugh. Well, if you're not going to talk, then... You really shouldn't be doing that. -Oh, no? What's that?

If you can hear this, please, come home. -Aren't you gonna get that, Sheriff? -This is Sheriff Hudson. -Yes, ma'am. Ma'am... ma'am, it is just the storm. Yeah, just stay inside. Lock your doors. It will pass soon. All righty. Ok-- all righty then. Yes. And to you. Good night. Sweet old Mrs. Francis. Always afraid of what isn't there... isn't she? -How did you know who I was speaking to? -Shot in the dark, I guess. Bullshit.

Please. I don't wanna die. Who-- who's over there? Who's over there? Get us out of here! Someone please get us out! Get us out of here! Evil hides in tiny places. Wouldn't you say? -How do you know all these things? -I don't know. All I know is it's true. Thousands of hours of manpower. Years chasing leads. A woman just doesn't walk in in the dead of night and tell you what happened. Doesn't work like that. -Sometimes the truth is hard to accept. -All right, the truth. Who are you? -Have you ever made a promise, Sheriff? -Sure. You swear? - Every damn day. -That's not what I mean. A promise... one that you know you could never keep. He had it all. Anything anyone could ever want. True love. -Incredible. -Yeah, you think so? -No, I'm lying to you. You're terrible. -I knew it. -You know how talented you are. -Yeah, well, talent doesn't pay the bills. -Doesn't pay the bills yet. What's this? -That I've been working on in secret for a while. Um, it's our dream house. What do you think? It's, uh... -It's perfect. -Yeah.... Yeah. Look at me. Hey. Whatever I have to do to make this happen, I'm gonna do it. What the hell were you thinking? I don't even know who you're turning into! Carol, come on. I just need you to trust me! I just need you to trust me, please! Okay? We-- we-- we need this. Yes. - Trust you? No, no, no. Not like this. You could go to jail or you're gonna get us-- - I know what I'm doing! Ah! -Fuck! Sorry. I'm sorry. Last time, I swear to God, and we never have to see these guys again. Okay? We'll get the fuck out of here. Anywhere you want to go. I can give you everything you deserve. -Last time? -Last time. Last time. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You promise? -All right, baby, I promise. Motherfuckers. You motherfuckers. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. I'll get you your fucking money, man. I'll get you your fucking money. Baby, look at me. Hey, hey, hey, look at me. We're fine. Okay? We're fine. No, no, no, no! Keep that on me, motherfucker! You keep it on me. Look at me. Hey! Open your mouth. - What? - I said open your fucking mouth! - Oh, God. You don't have to do this. No. -I said open your mouth. Good boy. Sorry, what were you saying? -Hey, boss. He's not gonna be able to talk with the gun in his mouth like that. -You know what, Ray? You might be right. I'm just saying. -Sorry about that. What were you saying? -You give me one week and I'll get you your fucking money. Hey, I'll get it to you. Every bit of it. -Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah, see, that doesn't work for me because you and I had an agreement, okay? I needed that shit today. -Fuck! Ah! This is you and me, man. This is between you and me, okay? -Hm. But I don't see anything wrong with having one less distraction for you around here. You need to get your head in the game, man. I need you to focus really fucking hard on getting me my fucking money! Will. My man. -What do you need, man? -Yeah, I'm just checking on you. -Okay. But do you have to call every day? -Honestly, no. It probably is a waste of our time. -Is-- is there-- is there a reason for this call right now? -Hang on just a second. But you know what they say. Rules are rules. -What the fuck is this? -I need this by tomorrow. -Tomorrow? This is at least two weeks. -Not my problem. It's about goddamn time you do some work around here. Yeah, fuck you too. - Jesus. Just stay out of trouble. Capeesh? -Capeesh? -It's Sarah's birthday! -And your point? -There's gonna be a party. -I don't care. -Big. There's gonna be cake. -Cake? -Okay, man. Uh, thank you for the-- What a fucking prick. -I am warning you, I've got a gun. Oh. Whoo! Come on, you can't do this to me, motherfucker. -Hey, Jim. Where you going? -I'll be right back. -I'm busy. What do you want? Jim, I need permission to leave my house. Like right now. -What? No. No, man. That's not how this shit works. -I feel like a-- a-- like a ghost in here or something man. Um, I am unwell. - Ghost? Are you serious? What are you smoking, man? -Jim, listen to me. I have not been smoking. Something is not right in my house. -You know I got no choice but to give you a piss test now. You know that, right? -Fuck! I'm not smoking! Something is not right here. Goddammit. You're really gonna make me drive all the way out to your fucking house just to give you this piss test? -Jim, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I have not been smoking. Something is not right in my house. -You're lucky this party sucks, asshole. -You fucking dick. -Are you shitting me? Will! Open the door, sweetheart. I know you're in there. Will, open up. Open the fucking door before Ray kicks this shit down. -Fuck. Okay! -Guess who's back? How you doing? Jesus Christ. The fuck happened here? So what? Didn't expect to see us today? It's been two weeks already. I know. I know. Time really flies when you're, uh... having fun. Hey, uh, where's the money? -Are you serious? There's-- there's no money. Why would there be money? There were no drugs. The cops picked those up when you-- -Hey, Rob. He ain't got the money, man. -What? It's not my fault he went and got himself arrested. -Mine either. -You should have hid the drugs before they came to clean up her body. -Are we being insensitive? -Just a little bit. -Look, I'm sorry for your loss. She was a very, very sweet girl. Fine woman, truly. She deserved a lot better than you, man. -Hey, fuck you. -Ray, tie this asshole up again. - No prob, Rob. Bring your ass over here! -What? - No! -What the fuck? - Whoo. I have a gun. -Whoa! Oh, my God. Hey, man. It's me. Open up. -Yeah, just a-- just a minute. Oh, shit. Dude, what the hell are you doing in there? - Fuck. - Open up. Motherfucker. Okay, come on. Come on, man. It's me. Stop trying to hide the drugs. -Stay. Come on. It smells like horseshit out here. Damn, dude. About fucking time. What are you doing in here, hiding dead bodies or something? I'm just fucking with you. Yeah. Hey. You better not be using again. -Oh, no, man. No, I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm clean, you know, ever since, um, Carol passed. Um, you know, I just called because I got scared. There's a lot of weird shit happening in here. -Yeah, I'd think so. What happened to your face? -Uh, it's a... cold sore. Cold sore? -Yeah, like a really bad one. -Yeah. Seeing stuff, weird shit... it's called cabin fever, my friend. Listen, you've been cooped up in here for so long your mind is starting to play tricks on you. You're thinking you're seeing stuff. Hey, the same thing would happen to me too, brother. Let me tell you. It's just like that movie. You know, The Shining ? Only you're not in a fancy hotel. You're in this... you're in this shithole. -Thank you. -Yeah, you're welcome. Hey, but guess what? I got you a present. I'm gonna need you to take a piss in this here cup. -Come on, man. Are you serious? -Dude, you think I drove all the way over here for nothing? Chop, chop. Piss, piss. I got a party to go to, my friend. Let's go, man. -You're a dickhead, Jim. -Yeah, I love you too. Get that shit away from me. I don't want to touch that. Here. Put it in this. -Oh, sorry. -Oh. -I really appreciate you coming by. You know, it means the world to me. -Yeah, I bet. Damn, dude, you got to start drinking more water. -Okay. -All right. You keep out of trouble. I'll come see you again tomorrow, okay? -Yeah. -What the f--? -Hey, look at me. Whatever I have to do to make this happen, I'm gonna do it. I promise. Well, those are some tall tales. Now, miss, you are trying my patience. I have listened to you jabber on into the dead of night. Enough of this. Are you going to file a report or is this just some sick game that you're playing? -What are your secrets, Sheriff? -I tell you what. I'll go get the paperwork. You can tell your stories to the blank pages that are in your future. Don't go anywhere. -You're a murderer. I can hear her screams. Like lightning in my skull. Don't you hear it? -You're a goddamn psycho! -I can see what you've done! -That's enough! -She fought for her life. -Stop! -You enjoyed it, didn't you? -I said that's enough! You think you know me? You think you know who I am? You think you know my secrets? Oh, you know nothing. You are as crazy as a shithouse mouse. You and all the stories you've been telling. -It's all true. -I don't give a rat's ass what's true and what's not. All I know is you're under arrest for assaulting a police officer-- oh, and filing a fake report. -I can't breathe. -Oh, you can't breathe? -Please. Please. -They all know.
