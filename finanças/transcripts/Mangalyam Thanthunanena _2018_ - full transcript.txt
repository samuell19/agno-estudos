Drink slowly. If he drinks this much, his spleen will be on fire soon. Not spleen, it's the liver. Whatever it may be, What's the point in saying after it's gone. You should learn from him. Even though there is this much liquor here, He didn't even drink a drop of it. He is really good-natured. The good-natured guy is sitting there after gulping a full bottle of liquor. Did he? Here comes the groom. Dude! Have a peg just to boost your confidence. Otherwise ifs ck, don": drink. Go! Go! Dude George! He is your only brother-in-law, right? You have to advise him about family life. Sure, I will advise him. He has lots of advice with him. I am telling you with the experience of marrying your sister, This family life is... You go and sleep. Brother-in-law! What happened? What's this? Brother-in-law, you will be answerable to god. I will take leave then. Ok ok. You may go, I shall... - Good night. - Good night. Mummy! Did you see George? There he is. Roy, ck then. - Roy brother! I have kept the milk in your room. - Ok. - Will it be spoilt? - Go away! Dear, that's enough. Come here. Aunty! What's up? It's 100' clock. Didn't she have any proposal? No, sister. We will get her married only after she finish her studies. Yes, that's good. Or else, What's up Royachha? - What? - Nothing. He is on phone all the time. I am relieved as he also got married. “M; dear, come here. It's already late. Isn't this Ammini's son? Dear, say bye to everyone. Why do you get drunk like this? - It's because of you dear. - Because of me? Sit on the ground. - I won't let you go without answering. - What's there to say? Now you can start massaging. Oh dear. See, that's great. Dear, massage well. Ok, let me see. Don't you have any diabetes? - What? - Just joking. - Diabetesl- Didn't you hear what he asked? He is smart. Sister! We are leaving. - Roy dear, good night. - Ok, good night. - Dear, aren't you coming? - Come. - Bye Ansi. - Come! Ok then, good night to everyone. Ansi, don't forget to text me. Hey! - Can't you walk carefully? - No problem. She's flying inside the house. Dear, you should study well. And listen to your Mom and Dad. And you should become a smart girl, ok? Roy uncle, are you going to die? These kids are so silly. Well, how's your daughter-in-law? She's a nice girl. They both match very well. Starting is good. This is the moment I had been waiting for. This is the dream I had seen. This is paradise. AFTER 3 MONTHS - This is not heaven, this is hell. - Leave me. - Yes, this is hell. - You are the vampire in my dream. No! You fool, if you don't know how to knock down, you shouldn't not come to the ring. Hit him man! Yes, like that. No, don't throw! Fool! Whenever I start for something urgent, this bicycle's chain comes off. Why are you standing like you lost something? What about the other thing? Did it work? Or did it flop? So, again your plan failed. If you want to see your wife's real nature, All you need to do is ask for their gold to pledge. What's up? Nothing dear. So, you have no work. Our government has built all these bridges, for jobless guys like you to sit. Isn't it, George? Dude Kuttappayi! You can go. I will come later. - Aren't you coming? - You go! Ok then. Well, did anything work out? Dirty fellow. That guy wants to irritate me whenever he sees me. Some people are like that. When it's bad time for you, they just stand and grin at you for no reason. Nowadays, even jobless people have started to tease me. That's not what I am worried about, How will I pay the money-lender tomorrow? Brother! You don't worry about it. There is a way. What way? Professor Kuruvi. You mean Elias Uncle? So, you asked her gold to pledge. Yes, I did. - She said she won't give it. - Yes Both of you had a big fight about it. It should be him who advised you, isn't it? Yes. There's a name to call the guys, who demand bride's ornaments soon after marriage, - "Dumb" - Yes. Brother, when I need money, who else can I ask for help? Dear, you are my nephew. To convince ladies and get things done, you are not as experienced as me. Tea is here. You have some tea. Only tea? Roy, wives are like elephants. - They often... - Do poop. No! They become grumpy. But all mahouts will have one thing with them to tame any elephant. That's Beaten rice and bananas. It's hook. With that small hook, they can tame any elephant. God has given a similar kind of hook to all husbands. You just need to use that hook. What do you mean? Get lost man! Love! That's the hook. You should love her sincerely. If you love her sincerely, they will give you anything. Is it? Is that true? But to love her... Whenever I see her face, I feel like slapping her. What brother said is sensible. Dude, I am single. After I die, all my belongings will be yours. But now, I don't have any money for you. If you do as I said, all your problems will be solved. Do you understand? Ok then, you may go. Brother, don't say like that. Only you can do something about it. Both of you may go. Come brother. How can you live alone in such a big house? It's been a long time since your wife died. Why don't you marry again? Marriage, at this age? You come here. Marriage is like a mole on your face. Mole? - Yes, can you erase it from your face? - No. What if it's a bindi instead of mole? Then? If it's a bindi, can't we change it as we want? Smart man! It's good that I came. I will visit you often. - Roy, I have a new idea. - Foolish guys. There's no use in telling you about it. Brother, you be confident. Everything will be fine. God, please show me a way. I had told the money-lender that I would return the money tomorrow morning. Don't know what will happen. Hey, don't go. You didn't take the rose flower. I have stuck it very well with the tape. Give it. After abusing her in the morning, If I give her rose in this night, will she accept it? Won't she? Of course, she will. You carry on. Well, you should never abuse a lady, about her father. Then? Say about her mother. Then they will feel even worse. You may go now. That's it. "Rose flower, cute rose flower" Two Porotta please, No porotta for you. God, hope this flower won't turn into a wreath for myself. What were you, Mom and daughter, doing inside? She was asking about things. There isn't any chair for you to sit. That's fine, I will sit here. He's trying to woo her with a rose flower, idiot. Dear, come close to me. How are things at home? It's a bit difficult. The relation between me and you... Don't you have anything else to talk about? - Roy, why are you late? - I... Aren't you angry with me? This tape... I got angry suddenly, that's why... III- Two bangles are there worth 1.5 soverign. You may pledge or sell them. You go and have bath. I will serve your food. Dude, any chance of getting something? Will get but need some time. Still I don't understand, why she gave the bangles before you gave the flower. Your... Dear, please stop. Have you borrowed money from somewhere else? Why? The financier's jeep is here. Dear, I will just go and tell Roy. It's your ex-girlfriend. Why is she carrying letters? Is she going to marry again? She is coming this way. - Roy! - Yes. How are you? Of course, he is very much fine. Tired of being too much fine. Our Finance is opening its fourth branch. That's nice. After you got married, your husband is getting richer and richer. It's all because of his hard work. He is hard-working and a strong believer. See the name, St. Mary's Financers. We have heard about it. It's very famous. I heard Your sister is topper in the school. We offer scholarships to students who study well. You should meet Sabu for that. He wants me to be with him all the time, Otherwise... He might scream like this. You should come for the inauguration. Of course. Didn't you have any children yet? Not yet. Don't worry. As Sabu is very hard-working, you will have soon. - I shall leave. - Ok. After being in love for 3 years, she gave you her wedding invitation letter like this, And you tried to suicide jumping from this bridge, right? These ladies are different only on looks, But they all have similar character. Whether it be Celine or Clara. Brother... Sabu, Paackattukunnel Sabu. This name suits you better. Why me? Sabu meaning financial difficulty. Sabu... I didn't sell the bangles. I pledged them and paid the money-lenders. (praying) Roy, shall I tell you something that you like the most? Sure, tell me quickly. Tell me. Shall I tell Daddy to arrange a job for you in his bank? No, Thanks. I will find a job myself. It's been 3 months since our marriage. You couldn't find a job till now. Is it because I borrowed your gold? I told you so that you won't have to beg if you earn something. Now, you have to ask me for money even to buy a tea. Is there any guy in this place who has never borrowed money from his wife? We don't need your dad's money for a good living. I am a high-class Christian. I don't have to live on my father-in-law's benevolence. So, don't talk about it again. No wonder you are like this. Dead You please go to sleep. Mother Mary! What shall I do? I don't balk, but still everyone considers me as a dog. Do you know the condition of jobless men? No way to go back to Gulf. What shall I do? Please help me to find a way. I will show you the way. You come to the church. I lost my job in Gulf because of the economic recession. Because of my bad luck, I was in my hometown for my wedding. Everyone on leave was sacked. All my friends, who came to attend my wedding, lost their jobs. That's true. Many people marry when they have bad luck. You Play- Father, that's not my concern right now. - I am not able to go to Clara's house. - Why? I married her saying I was employed in Gulf. And now, I am not able go back... Tell me the truth, how much is your debt? Around 10,11,12... You fix a number. 15 thousand? Lacs. In gulf, were you working in the factory manufacturing debts? Whatever I saved from my job, was finished with my sister's marriage. I don't even have a single penny now. I have to beg her even for daily expenses. Whenever I meet your mother, She tells me all the problems. Her concern is that you are roaming around without trying for a job. What she said is right. You are a stupid. How can you not find a job till now? Dear Roy. There is a statement in the holy book, That even his siblings hate a poor man. Not to say about his friends then... So, you find a job as soon as possible. Othenlvise, you will get beaten like this. Serve him the fish curry. Where were you the whole day? Your phone was out of range. I had gone to Perumbavoor. Tessy and George had come today. Today is their first wedding anniversary. They waited for you till evening. Tessy is your only sister. Why didn't you call her? This is the fish she brought. My Daddy always says that, Roy is never available on phone, when needed. Yesterday, he called you seven times. Then he was complaining to me. Is it? Roy, why are you like this? You serve him the vegetables. Dear, why did your Daddy call him? If he called seven times, There will be something to trap me. Daddy has arranged a job for you in the bank, in the position of manager. Really? Oh St.Antony! You heard my prayers. This is all God's wish. For him to get a job in the hometown, I had offered 4 eggs. That too organic one. Is it Mummy? Thank God it was fulfilled. The Saint is very precise. Yes I had told Tessy to stay here for a week. But George didn't agree. His mother gets upset if she stays here. Tessy will be really happy to know that you got a job. Mummy, shall we go and meet Daddy tomorrow itself? Of course. You both go tomorrow morning itself. Then, you should return tomorrow itself. If she goes to her own house, she will get stuck there. ROY, Why did you stop eating? Are you full? Yes, when we eat food with Mom on one side, and wife on the other, We, men become full very fast. There she sits with her mouth open, stupid. - How much? - 20. Isn't that's Roy's car? It's Shamsu. - Hello. - Hello, Roy. - Yes, tell me. - Where are you off to? I am going to Clara's house. I am here in the restaurant. Roy, if you want to talk on phone, stop the car. Don't talk while you drive. - Yes, tell me. - When will you be back? I have found a fantastic idea. Really? What's that? I will tell you in detail. Can't say that over phone. I had told you to stop the car and talk. She won't let you be in peace even in the car. - I will call you tomorrow morning. - Then... Stop, stop over there. Stop there. Get out. Who were you talking on phone? A friend. Was yourfriend in any emergency to talk like this? No Come here. Move! Sir, please. Sir, he was talking on the phone while... Is it? Where? Let me see. You look smart. Should be rich, right? - Nothing like that. - Shall I fine you 1000 bucks? Sir, it was an emergency call. Ok, then I will tell you about the fine details. If you drive talking on phone, it is charged under section 147. With bill, you have to pay 1000 bucks, without bill, it's 500 bucks. I will pay without bill. I will get the money from my wife. - The cash... - From wife? Smart guy, you are a role model to all men. Go and get it. Com e fast. Luckily, he agreed for 600 bucks. Please give me 600 bucks, I don't have any money. I don't have, I won't give you. Ask your friend who was on phone, to bring the money. Please, don't joke at this time. I will be in trouble. Give the money please. Clara, where are you... Clara... - Sir, look there. - Why is she coming this way? I don't have 600 bucks with me, And I am not going to pay you. I warned him 1000 times, Not to talk over phone while driving. You can arrest him if you want. I can drive myself. I can understand your situation. Only me. You may go. - No case charged. - Sure? You may go. My Phone. Thanks. You shouldn't have left him like that. You could have given him some punishment. - I will drive, - Ok, you drive. What better punishment could he get? Mom, we are on the way. Roy! Don't talk over phone while driving. When I do something, it's a big mistake. And when you do it, it's alright. When I said it's me, they didn't say anything. Daddy! Come! Come! - Mercy! They have come. - Yes, I am coming. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. Now and always. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. God bless you. - So, how are things going? - Good. How can it be not good? It's my daughter Clara who's been with him. No doubt about that. I have raised her like that. - Roy, you are working in Dubai, right? - Yes. - When are you going back? - That... Why does he need to go back? Only fools go and work in Dubai and Europe. Roy doesn't need that. That's true. If he is good, he can prosper here too. That's right. Here is the best example for that. By God's grace, Roy has saved enough for 3-4 generations. That's great. Then, for our Parish hall construction, write a receipt for 50000 from Roy. Yes, the construction of Parish hall near the cathedral, has been going on. With the help of few rich people here, We could finish that work soon. That's the reason we came here for a visit. Isn't it priest? 50000, is not a problem for you, right? No, it's not. That shows his family's dignity. Joby, bring me the cheque. Here it is. 1 lac from me and 50000 from Roy. Let things move faster. You go inside and have something. You come in. They just came. - Daddy! - Roy! Come, sit. Shall I serve one for you. No thanks. - Well, if you insist... I liked that. You should not do anything that Clara doesn't like. Sir, I have done all the accounts, and have kept the account book inside the table. Could you please sign this cheque? I need to submit it in the bank tomorrow. - If you are done, you may leave. - Ok, Sir. See you then It's a big head ache to manage this banking business alone. When I went to Singapore last time, I decided to appoint a person who can be trusted I just remembered one thig, This ring on your hand, is made of platinum. I bought it from Singapore. Do you how much that diamond cost? 2 lacs. It's cut from the same piece. One on your ring and the other on Clara's ring. When I see this ring on your hand, I feel that my daughter is in safe hands. Never take it off. He has said it 100 times. It's so boring. She is my only child. All these belong to her. Roy, you are my son too. You should get involved in all my business. That's the reason for appointing you as the Manager of Trissur branch. Daddy, I am not familiar with banking. Dear Roy, why are you scared? I am here to teach you everything. You bring your necessary stuff and shift here this week itself. You and Clara can live here with all comforts. - Here? - Of course! You can't drive between Trissur and Thodupuzha daily. If needed you can go home on Saturdays. Not only that, We will also be happy if you both are here with us. For me, living here... it won't work daddy. Ok, don't decide now. You discuss with Clara and then decide. What's wrong in that? - No, that won't work out. - Why? When Daddy is helping you to be on your own... If I live here with you, Who will take care of my house. What about my mother? Mummy told me to arrange a job for you. She will be very happy to hear this. Don't worry that She will be alone, We shall appoint a maid to help her. And every Saturday and Sunday we can go there and meet her. That can't happen. She brought me up not to spend her old age with a maid. If she becomes sick, who will take her to hospital? You always have silly reasons. Just because you can't go to work. Clara, now you are talking about something different. You only have problem with what I say. You don't have any value for my opinion. Dear, what we were talking and what are you talking now? I know that you have more affection to your mother and sister. Don't make me mad, just keep quiet. I always have second position. You are a Mummy's kid, just a mummy's kid. I always come second. He used to love me a lot till his marriage. After marriage, Now I had to beg him for 3 days to get a medicine. You lose your sons once they get married. Wives get first place in their mind. Yes, that's the reason I fled my daughter-in-law. Now, she's at her house, My son and myself at our home. All are at peace. It's the fate of all mothers. Look, Roy is here. Here is your medicine. We both were praying here. - Shall I go home then? - Fine. Don't need to worry that you are alone. Ok dear. Bye. Didn't she come? Did you come alone? She will come back after one week. One week? I knew it when she started from here. So, I have to do all the work for one week? What did Clara's daddy tell you? Job is ready. But I will have to stay there. I would be able to come here only on Saturdays only. You are alone here. So, I denied it. Good boy. You are so stupid. You stay there and do your job. Don't worry about me If you go there, I can bring Tessy and George here. They have three sons there. So, he won't have any problem to stay here. Nobody's here, only me... This is the moment I have been dreaming about This is heaven. Roy! Dear Roy! Dear, Wake up! Dear wake up! Have some tea. It's 7 o'clock. Get up. Where is tea? - Don't you want to have tea? - Yes. Then make some tea. Make one cup for me too, without sugar. I don't feel good as I didn't have tea. Thank God! He is at home. I am tired of calling you, Why didn't you take the call? I had gone to Clara's house. All husbands are like that. They won't take any calls, when they are at wife house. Have you got any idea to make money? Yes, I have. What's that? You get ready, I will be back in half an hour. Tell me what the idea is. I will tell you. We need to go to Peramangalam. That's fine. I will take care of it. Susan Thomas, fantastic. - What? - The name. Who is Roy? It's me. This is my friend Shamsu. - Would you like to have a drink? - Anything is fine. No, Thanks. I have some financial problem, I lost my job in gulf. I have some liabilities after I got my sister married. I need some money to roll now. Neethu had told me that you would come. Neethu is Shamsu's friend, right? Not friend, I work as peon in the bank where madam works. That's how we know each other. Then why didn't you apply for loan from Neethu's bank? That's because... I borrowed an amount of 10 lacs... - It's 12.. - 12 lacs. It will be 13 lacs including the interest. If I could get a loan from this bank, I could repay that loan. If you grant 15 lacs, we could repay all the debt and be relaxed. Isn't it? Ok Ok. Anyways, you submit the documents. Let me check. - Then, please come here tomorrow afternoon. - Sure. Let's see if we can do something. Please, you should try your best to sanction this. It will be really helpful. Don't worry. Mummy, what happened? This is about the 12-lac loan you borrowed from Co-operative bank. It's written that if we don't pay within 7 days, They will file a case and attach our properties. Roy, please tell her to help us. Are you worried because of this? I will get some money within 2 days. With that amount, I will pay the interest And renew the loan. You don't worry about it, ok? (phone ringing) Hello, Roy! Yes, tell me. What are you doing there? I was thinking about you. I know, that's why I called you. Is it raining there? Not raining, but there's a big thunder. Then it will rain. Here it's raining heavily. If you were here, I would have slept hugging you tightly. Hugging your...! Yes, yes. You are not romantic at all. Who said I am not romantic? I am extremely romantic. Not just that, this is the perfect time to be romantic. You, naUQhTV! Yes, I will be naughty. Her...! Roy, I checked your documents. But you can't get loan from our bank. I am sorry. Madam, I... Madam, if you try, you can somehow... Somehow means... See Roy, your name is listed in the credit bureau. Such a person can't get loan from any bank. Shamsu, don't you know about all this? I am sorry. Madam, can you at least sanction a small amount. I can do one thing. If you could bring some gold to pledge, Maybe I can do something. Shall we leave? - Thanks for your time. - Come dude. If there was gold, do we need to come here? You! He rushes as if she will sanction him loan immediately! What is this dude? What you did is very bad. Roy, you please calm down. There will be some way. What way? Nothing. The notice has already come from the bank. What can we do now? For the time-being, let's have a lemonade. Then you will cool down. Two chilled lemonade please. No soda, plain water is fine. Shall I shake it? - We are already shaken, So, you just mix it. - Ok. You don't be tensed. There will be some way. My bag! Give it. Leave it. - Give me. - Move away. My bag! Security! Get lost man! Leave the bag. Didn't I tell you that there will be a way? That's it. - What? - Look there. He is some poor goon. He is the one who will help you get the loan. That goon. What are you saying? If you interfere now, that manager will sanction your loan in the next moment. - Go and handle it. - Me? When you were in 4th grade, You had broken Shiju's head when he stole your card. Go and break his head like that. Go! Should I? If you go now, she would give you even the bank itself. Go and handle it. We can get loan from some banks in this way. See the way he's going. He will get it for sure. Yes, poor guy. He looks like a wasp flying around a candle. - Do you know who he is? - Who is it? He is Shibu, Thaamara Shibu. He is accused in a stab case. Accused in 8 cases? Not eight, accused in a stab case. Brother! What dude? Manager's husband has sent to take the car. Then why didn't you tell me this earlier'? Sham su! (righting) What is it? Don't give up. Move! Start the car. Just think that you sanctioned a car-loan. I am going to sleep. I am tired of working. You tell her to come back. When she goes to her house, always get stuck there. - Dear! - Yes. Your phone is ringing. Ok. - Hello Madam, - Hello Roy, I am Susan. Yes, I understood. Roy, I called to thank you. No problem, in that situation, anyone would... Who is that guy? Why did he fight with you? Shall we meet if you have no problem? Of course, I will come. Madam, could you please reconsider about that loan? Yes, I want to talk about that too. - Then let's meet at Lulu Marriot Hotel. - Ok. Also bring the documents when you come. Fine. Ok, goodnight. Madam... Yes, tell me Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. My loan... Mummy! When will she come? Who? Was that not Clara? Mummy, you go and sleep. Who else it could be? What an idea! After all these 20 years of friendship, This is the first time your idea is of use to me. That's not the problem with my idea. Because of your bad time... What man? Haven't you learned to sit on this bridge yet, After all these years? I don't know balancing like you do. She will take care of the loan. Othenlvise, she wouldn't have called, right? Of course. When shall we go? Not we, only me. So when your job is done... Come on dude! Let me take care of myself first. Then I will Where is he? Jesus! Dude, take a shower before you go. Come. Welcome to Cochin Marriot. Which way is the Restaurant? This way, sir. I came by bus. There was heavy traffic on the way. That's why I came late. No problem, I also reached just now. Madam, isn't this restaurant very expensive? Roy, spending money like this is fun, once in awhile. It is not enough just to save the money, But you should also know how to spend it properly. That's about rich people. I am a pauper. I shall pay the bill. I called you here to thank you. I have to treat you for saving me. The other day, didn't you meet that guy in the bank? My husband had sent him, ...to insult me. Why does he do that? He keeps sending people to my workplace to create issues, So that I would lose my job. That's his intention. Madam, didn't you try for a compromise? We don't have to compromise with people, whom we don't like. We need to avoid them. We are not divorced, but we are separated. Roy, why are you looking gloomy? Is it because of my story? No Madam. Is there any family where there are no issues? If you ask my opinion, It's better to compromise all these issues. Once we start loving each other, We will forget everything. That's my style. No one loves anyone. No one can understand anyone. Can you tell from the bottom your heart, "that you love your wife sincerely? You look sad. Did I hurt you? Nothing Madam. I am not in a state to drive. I can get a bus to my house, from the stop nearby your flat. Thank you. I am very much relieved after talking to you. Don't worry about loan. I can sanction a loan of 3 lacs for you. I can't thank you enough. My house will be confiscated, if I don't get this money. Be confident. Please come. You don't have to come tomorrow to sign the documents. - Take a seat. - Sure. What would you like to drink? I am fine. Anything will do. Then I will make some tea. It's very beautiful view from here. It's only my life that is not beautiful. You take a seat. I shall bring the documents. This is the perfect place to live. Nobody's there to trouble. No dude, I don't need that loan. It won't work out. No one loves anyone. No one can understand anyone. Can you tell from the bottom your heart, ...that you love your wife sincerely? "Unknowingly, for the first time" "Silence fills my eyes" "Silently, without fading" "Your memories come in this night" "From afar did you know this heart's suffering" "From afar did you know this heart's suffering" "As a comfort in my life, this moment is near" Daddy, problems are there in everyone's life. Even though we have problems, we have to continue with our life. Roy is good-hearted. Even if he is not rich like us, I love him, and he loves me too. He will take good care of me. I will be very happy with him Daddy. "On the path I came listening to your voice" "A tune hum med by the breeze..." "On the path I came listening to your voice" "A tune hum med by the breeze..." "When it is pulling my heart strings" "Come near and dissolve as a melody" "On your tender lips, unseen by anyone" "I am searching for a drop of honey" "On your tender lips, unseen by anyone" "I am searching for a drop of honey" "Come near with love's message" "And dissolve in me as desire" "Unknowingly, for the first time" "Silence fills my eyes" "Silently, without fading" "Your memories come in this night" Roy! When did you reach? I reached by afternoon. I had called you on phone, But you didn't take the call. Where were you? I was... Dear, you are here. Who is this? Did you forget me? You go and change your clothes. I will serve you food. God knows if it's burnt. Valsa sister came with me. Daddy has sent her to stay with us for few days. Hasn't your daddy told you that you need to ask your husband, Before you appoint someone for house chores? My dear Roy, don't start a fig ht about that. If Valsa sister is here, that will be a help for Mummy. Not only that, she cooks very well. After I came, you didn't even smile at me. Though I had gone to stay there for a week, I couldn't stay without you even for a day. That's why I returned immediately. I thought you would be overjoyed to see me And you would hug me. Who told you that I am not happy to see you? Yellow colour won't suit me. Does it have to? Then it will suit. Come near. Which is this new chain? Daddy bought it for me. How much does it weigh? 4 sovereigns. Then, let's go and have food. Come on! I will fill your little tummy with all the food. Here is the tomato curry. Tomato curry, which I make is the best. Try it once. Valsa, aren't you eating? That's ck, you have it. That's how it should be. She is smart. I already had my food. Dear, you pour the curry, mix it and chew very well. If you eat this, you will get a loose motion. You won't get any illness. Roy, do you have any problem? You look very gloomy. Roy, you don't share your problems with me. You keep things to yourself. Ok, now don't say that I don't share anything with you. Jesus, how will we repay all this money? There aren't many days left. We can pay it easily, But only if you help me. What can I do about it? I don't have 2 lac bucks with me. If I ask Daddy for help, won't it be a shame? Or let's ask Daddy for help. Let's tell him that we will return it on a fixed day. No, it's a shame to borrow money from in-laws, Why so much ego about this? It's just a small help, to get our things done. Dear, it's you who has to help me now, not your Daddy. Roy, what can I do about it? If you are talking about my gold, forget it. When I have a need, who else can I ask for help? I don't know. I don't have that much gold to give you whenever you ask. I am tired of this. Have you ever taken back any of my gold that you had pledged? I won't give you my gold any more. You calm down. You are right. I will take back everything. It's all because I lost my job. It's not for buying alcohol or weed. My visa will be ready soon. Once I go to gulf, this problem will be solved. My dear girl, look at me. Listen to me. How many chains do you have? Three. No, there are four including the one Daddy gave this time. How many necks have you got? Only one, right? Then why do you need four chains? Roy, I won't give you my chain to pledge. That's it. Hey, I don't want to pledge it. You have four. Let's sell one of them. Enough to survive for the time being. Aren't you ashamed to say like this? If you wanted chain to pledge, you should have bought me one yourself. This is the chain my Daddy gave me. I won't give this chain to pledge. So, when I am in need you won't give me that, right? No. See, lfl can let you live in my house and take care of you, I know how to get it from you. - Ok, you try. - Yes, I will try. If it's that urgent, your Mummy has got a 5-sovereign chain on her neck. You go and get that. You stupid! Get lost! Get out of my house! Halleluiah! Halleluiah! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Halleluiah! Halleluiah! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! - Will you come today? - Sure, I will come. Now he will ask about my job. Useless fellow! Where are you off to? You haven't got any job yet, did you? In a way that's good. If you get a job, you can't roam around like this. Well, can you arrange a job for me? Don't say that you can't. If you try it will be done. Hey! Don't go. Please. Ajob anywhere is fine, in CBI or Reserve bank. If that's not possible, even in Secretariat will do. - If you try it will be possible. - I will try. Don't go. I will let you go only after you arrange a job for me. I will do. Hey, I will keep reminding about it. Roy, Kuttappayi was saying about some job. - Leela sister, didn't you know that? - No If he recommends, one can get a job in Reserve bank of India. Really? Are you talking about our Kuttappayi? Sister, your elder son is jobless now, isn't it? - If you tell him, he will arrange it. - Ok the dear. Also tell yourfriends about it. Let all the youngsters have job. That's good. - Did you have a fight? - Yes. - Was that a big fight? - Yes. Great, then you will get it for sure. Usually she gives you when you go back after the fight. It's not like that. She won't give it. Then it will be a problem. That Bank Manager is adamant. He says that you have a lot of money with you, but you are not repaying the loan intentionally. I requested him not to send the notice. But he didn't listen. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Nothing is going to be fine. You come to my house and see. It's a hell. You are saying that because you have never been to my house. We will find a way. Aren't you eating anything? No, I don't want anything. Are you worried about the money? Your Daddy used to say that A man becomes a real man, when he has to face a financial hardship. Dear, you don't need to beg anyone for gold. You don't need to get insulted in front of anyone. This is the chain James gave me 32 years back. Then he had told me not to take it off unless our kids are in need. You sell it and pay the bank interest. You don't have to be afraid. When one door closes, nine doors will open. Daddy had given you this chain. What else do you have for his memories? If I take it, I will be cursed by God. I already have the bad-name that I am trying to grab my wife's gold. Now, I don't want to be known as the one trying to rob my own mother. What can I do with this chain? I have you to remember your Dad, not this chain, You take this. We need to pay 12 lacs. If we don't pay 2 lacs now, The loan amount will be around 15 lacs in total. If they file a case, we won't be able to repay it even after selling our house. You please listen to me. You sell it. It will be a relief for the time-being. No Mummy. It was you who said that when one door is closed, nine doors will open I will find a way to repay this loan. You go to bed. Me and your Dad has had lots of fights. But your Dad never left me alone even for a night. Daddy brought this stone from Singapore. It costs 2 lac bucks. Do you like it? This stone will be fixed on ourwedding ring. This ring on your finger, is made out of platinum. I bought it from Singapore. Do you know how much does that diamond cost? 2 lacs. Roy, when I have this ring on my finger, I feel that you are with me. I will never take it off. You should also not remove it. Promise me. The cost of this ring is not 2 lacs, it's you. I will never take it off. Promise. - Sir, Isn't this Platinum? - Yes We don't accept Platinum As per RBI rules, Only Gold is pledged here Not only here, Platinum Jewellery can't be pledged in any Banks! O Kay She is correct No metal other than Gold is pledged in any Banks in India That is the rule In short, such cosy items are all utter waste, isn't it? Other than for flaunty purpose, These don't serve any need! That is the reason they're accepted where they were sold! One more option is there A man in Thrissur gives loan against such items! He may accept Why don't we approach him? Should we? He charges exorbitant interest You heard of Peruki Rapaayi? He is the one Should we really approach him? I got no other options than this. "Don't ask for bills" "Default payment is injurious to Health" These notes are not for fun Hey, look at me Even against the Underwear this Rapaayi gives loan But if default a payment, I'll take the right of your possession In that case, you can trust us Enough, take out the item. Give..Give Here it is What is this? An Aluminium Ring? - No No.. - Then? It's Platinum ring Item looks good Studded with Stones also! Those are Diamonds No matter what they are! Rapaayi has no problem What is the cost of this in the Market? Nearly between 2.5 AI 3 lacs! For this? Ashoka..Ashoka..Check what the price for this item is! - Isn't this Platinum with diamond? - Yes - It costs around 2 lacs - oh two Iakhs! Shall I bring tea for them? Not necessary - Not necessary, is it? - Yes He says 2 lacs So I will give around 2.5, 3.. I will give you around One lac rupees against this - What do you say? - Oh no! Bro, I at least need 1.5 lacs Othenlvise there is no purpose of pledging What are you talking, man? It's against my business policy It's worth 2.5 lacs You must give me 1.5 lacs, please" Bro.. As we belong to a same religion, I agree. Take 1.5 lacs But I deduct 10,000 as one month interest Here is the balance one lac forty thousand. Take it O Kay Are you haPPV7 - Don't you? - Yes Today is 7th On 7th of every month, Interest amount should reach my table, okay If not, then there is no need for you to come here That's it I'll reach it promptly It's our word Okay, go to Asokan..he is waiting for you Hey lad! Stop - Is this your wedding ring? - Yes - Yours? - Hmm - Does your wife know? - No O my Lord! Only now I really feel happy Why? No, I've been thinking I'm the number one crook in the World See you then Don't worry, won't we redeem it in a jiffy!

It was all spent from the loan amount taken from the bank Had he been little careful, he wouldn't face such a crisis How will he? He doesn't know that a "Small leak will sink a great Ship" This was because he lost the job, isn't it, Mom? Othenivise this won't be his condition, isn't it? No dear, that was not the cause He used to lend money to others when he had enough He is good at lending But poor in redeeming He feels reluctant to ask His dad was also like him Many people have cheated him In that case, I had too many quarrels with Roy's Dad It's from the dad, Sons learn to handle cash In money matters, hold him tight Otherwise he will go aloof - I won't ask - You needn't have to.
