BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS In 1916 Romania entered the First World War on the side of France, Russia and the United Kingdom, driven by a desire to reunite its fractured provinces into one united Romania. Despite initial successes in Transylvania, Russia's withdrawal from the war left the country isolated and exposed. Romanian forces suffered massive setbacks as a fierce German invasion devastated the country forcing a humiliating treaty on its government. Although never ratified by King Ferdinand, that treaty is now being used against Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. The war is all but over and hopes for international recognition of a united Romania are fading away. Your Majesty, we'd be safer to return another day, with the ambulances reloaded. - Bring more bread, Baliff ! - Our children starve to death ! There's bread for everyone ! - Back ! Stay back ! - Here you go ! Don't push ! There's enough bread for everybody ! Stop pushing, people ! Please bread and medicines ! Please, your Majesty, get in the car ! Tomorrow we'll bring firewood, more food and medicine. I promise. Back ! Stay back ! Romania thrives only as an independent country. Our borders must be restored to that for which our ancestors fought and won ! Borders, I would remind you, which were promised to us by our Allies before we joined the war ! The promise of a Greater Romania was the fundamental reason for which we sacrificed hundreds of thousands of our soldiers' lives. And now, gentlemen, to find that this promise is being withdrawn is utterly intolerable ! Moreover, Romania has a legitimate right to free... Yes ? Your Majesty, you wanted me to inform you when the Queen arrives. Marie ! Next time you leave the Palace, no matter where you go, you should observe protocol and have a detail escort you. - We live in uncertain times... - But they need our help. I know your heart is in the right place and you're eager to help everyone but that must not mean endangering your life. - Please, be more prudent. - I am being prudent. Missy, I can't be fighting you as well ! Thank you ! As well as who ? Our politicians are powerless... Negotiations are not going well in Paris. Perhaps they're not aware of all the facts. Perhaps they don't want to be ! And now, the very future of Greater Romania is at stake. So what would you have us do ? Go back on our word ? After thousands of soldiers gave their lives on the frontline ? No, but everyone is against us... England, France, the Americans... They're deciding our fate along with everybody else's. And they're all hiding behind the Bucharest Treaty with Germany. A treaty I did not agree to. A treaty which I didn't even sign ! Nando, you promised to be King of a united Romania. We must stand by our word ! Remember who you are ! You are a strong king and together we'll find a way. Mr. Prime Minister ! Mr. Brătianu ! Ion ! Please ! Your Excellency... Wouldn't you say that a more... diplomatic approach would be better ? No ! You saw what happened in there ! They're making a mockery of us with this Conference ! For that, I apologize. Clemenceau and Lloyd-George simply ignore us... while the American president can't even find Romania on the map ! Sorry, sorry ! I'm doing everything in my power, but I am only one man... Do you have any ideas ? Your Majesty, His Highness Prince Știrbey has returned from his trip and is asking to see you. One moment. Show him in. Prince Știrbey. Your Majesty... How was your trip ? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Greater Romania but now distances are twice what they used to be. We might not have a Greater Romania anymore. Have you seen the papers ? From Paris ? I have. I wouldn't want to be in Brătianu's shoes right now. Still, there must be something we can do ! What could we do ? It's all up to the politicians now ! I have an idea ! What if I wrote to my cousin, George ? He must have a say in this, after all, he's the King of England ! What do you think ? - Without telling Ferdinand ? - There's no time for that now ! Not that he's letting me do anything anyway. "Missy, royalties don't meddle in politics... They are two separate businesses !" And he's right. That's why I doubt your cousin, the King, could be of much help. If only I were Brătianu, for sure we'd make ourselves heard ! Barbu, why am I not a man ? Well, you won't hear any complaints from me that your Majesty is not a man... But if you were to join this fight, I'm sure you'd win. You have the will and the heart of the nation ! His Majesty, the King, requests the presence of His Highness Prince Știrbey right away. Your Majesty ! My dear cousin George, I'm writing to you to ask, quite plainly, for help regarding our unfair reception in Paris... Mother, I'm no longer a child. You cannot bend me to your will anymore ! Carol, my dear, please hear me out, it's not about "my will", it's about your status ! Thank God, we've stopped the misfortune and the marriage is annulled. Yet, even knowing what's at stake, you keep seeing this woman. Carol, in Heaven's name, why ? Because I love her, Mother ! Can't you see Zizi is my only happiness ? Nothing can keep me away from her. But what could you know about love ? How can you say that to me ? Do you know what I went through ? The point is we are not commoners, we are the royal family ! You've been brought up to know the difference ! - So remember who you are ! - Enough ! The Count of Saint-Aulaire is here from Paris. They're still holding the Bucharest Treaty against Romania. And the Count of Saint-Aulaire advises us what ? That the King sends additional help to Paris to save the matter. - Someone whose voice will be heard. - Who ? We'll be their laughing stock ! Let Brătianu finish what he started ! A woman, even a Queen, has no place in a political situation of such scope ! Gentlemen, please ! Gentlemen, please ! Your Excellency, what exactly do you suggest the Queen do in Paris ? Well, Her Majesty could help improve Romania's position, considering the current urgent matters. She'll have help from the Romanian community in Paris, quite influential and well-organized for some years now. Monsieur Le Flers ? Of course, my fellow journalists and I will prepare the French press properly. Why aren't we looking for an alternative ? For instance, why don't I go to Paris ? Mr. Averescu ? yYour Majesty, we need someone with diplomatic experience... Let's not forget that, officially, royals are not to take part in the Peace Talks. A preposterous idea ! It's a politician's job to solve those matters, no matter how long the talks take ! Moreover, who'd pay for such an expensive trip ?! - I will see to that. - Is that so ? Wouldn't it be wiser to spend your money on relief, instead of wasting it on such a useless trip, Mr. Moscovici ?! Your Royal Highness, bankers usually invest for a profit. Her Majesty, The Queen, will increase relief for Romania tenfold. If His Majesty, The King, agrees with His Excellency, the Count of Saint-Aulaire, I will respectfully accept his wish and leave for Paris ! So, it's decided. Thank you, Gentlemen ! Gentlemen, we've just witnessed a severe violation of the Constitution. The law clearly stipulates the decisions are taken by parties and their politicians. - Agree ! Exactly ! - Agree ! Yes ! Let's face it, this time the King has gone too far ! He can't decide this over our head, he's exceeding his authority ! This could set a bad precedent. - We've already sent Brătianu ! - He needs more support. We should send more ministers, not the Queen ! We are risking a lot ! Just one of her spontaneous outbursts and we'd be back in the pre-Bismark era, gentlemen ! - With our whole country divided ! - I'm not convinced ! Better the Queen than Brătianu ! He's done nothing so far ! Let the Queen go ! She speaks their language and knows how to get to them ! And what can we do now ? The Queen will be on a train on March the 1st ! Calm down, wait a second. Don't we have the local press on our side ? Not all of it, but yes, most of it. We could commission a few articles to cast some serious doubts on the merits of this trip. What we really need is the Prince himself ! We need to get Carol on our side. He has increasing influence at the court, and he could keep his mother in check. If we promise him our support, he might prove to be a more flexible king, wouldn't you say ? Maybe this way we can still stop the Queen from going to Paris. - No ! - Mister Cantacuzino ! Gentlemen ! - Any word from London ? - Unfortunately, no. His Majesty, King George hasn't answered yesterday's telegram, either. Please ask that we talk to London on the phone. If we can't get George, try our embassy, perhaps Joe Boyle is there. Yes, Your Majesty. Are you really going to wear those last century rags to Paris ? You really have no other concern than fashion ? If you don't wish to come with us, you're free to stay home. Carol's told me you're actually going on a political mission to Paris. Why would you meddle in something like that ? We got hold of Mr. Boyle on the telephone. Thank you. Joseph, hello ! - Joe ? - Marie, is that you ? Yes, Joe, it's me ! - How are you ? - Oh, I'm fine ! As I explained in my telegram, yesterday. Have you read it ? - Of course. - I'm going to Paris ! Well, that is wonderful news ! Tell me, what are you going to do in Paris ? Well, it's not an entirely official visit, but I'm going there to help our cause ! I think that's an outstanding idea ! And I bet you'll dazzle them in Paris ! Dear Joe, you don't know how much your trust means to me ! I'll also be coming to London, to see Nicky ! - How's he doing at Eton ? - He is doing great ! You know Marie, your boy's not a kid anymore, he's a handsome young man with impressive grades ! I'm so proud of him ! His Excellency, the Count of Saint-Aulaire, and His Lordship, the Marquis de Flers have already left for Paris. But... But ? Your Majesty, please forgive me, are you absolutely sure it's a good idea to send the Queen on such an important mission ? "A good idea" ? It's a disaster. A terrible mistake ! Do you really think you're the most qualified to make that judgement ? The plan is not without risk. But it is our last chance ! General, how soon can the Queen leave ? The Royal Train is ready to go. Please notify all the official channels, our press service, and the one in Paris. Gentlemen, please. Thank you, I'll take it from here. My men saw Carol dining with Zizi Lambrino at Capșa. Afterwards, they disappeared into her house together. Yes, I saw him storming out of here earlier. - And you didn't say anything to him ? - Well, what should I have said ? Well, you could've talked him out of this nonsense with that woman. I tried ! Now you should talk to him, father to son. You know, he could use more of that in his life. - We all could. - He never listens to me ! And you know I've tried everything. And frankly, when he gets into one of his rages... he's uncontrollable. You really should've spent more time with him as a child, instead of leaving him with that awful governess. So now it's my fault ?! You've conveniently forgotten Uncle Carol's rules. I mean, what was I to do ?! Other than hope every day that you'd step in... - Well, did you ? Did you ? - Fine, we're both to blame. - Now what ? - Now, I'll tell you what. I'm going to bring our son home. Then you'll find him a significant position, impressive enough for him to keep. As far away from Bucharest as possible. How dare they call you a traitor just because you love me ? You'll be Queen. I'll prove it, Zizi ! I'll show them how justice is done ! - What is it ? - Please forgive me, madam... But Her Majesty the Queen is here. She demands to speak to His Royal Highness right away. Just to make myself clear, Your Majesty, I am not a commoner. The Lambrinos, my family, are aristocrats ! Tell her, darling ! Tell her what I mean to you ! I might not be a princess, but you must understand that Europe, that the world is changing ! Russia understood that ! No one can reverse history. Carol truly loves me. And I love him, with all my heart. I make him happy. What more could a mother want for her son ? Carol, dear, I beg you ! Get up and come home with me ! Sweetheart, tell her what I mean to you ! Please ! If you wish to be worthy of your role as heir to the throne of Romania, you will stand up now and return to the Palace with me. Now, Carol ! Why ? What are you going to do ? Punish me ? Therefore, you acknowledge the King's appointment of your brother as the new heir to the Crown. - Can she do that ? She can't do that ! - Shut up ! Who ?! Nicky takes my throne ?! Nicky is a blasted nobody ! Where are you going ? Don't leave, please ! How low can you go, mother ! Father ! Father ! Father ? Father ?! Yes. - Did you agree to this ? - To what ? To put Nicky on the throne if I keep seeing Zizi ? Carol, your mother and I have discussed this and decided the best for you at this time is to go to Transylvania. You will take the aid supplies from your mother's foundations there. It's not enough you're destroying me and Zizi, now you're dispatching me to the other end of the country ? What am I to bring bread to the poor ? No, you'll bring relief to the less fortunate. Mother is traipsing around Paris with my sisters, Nicky is lording it in London, and you're sending me, your first born, to the sticks ?! Carol, you will behave as befits a future King, showing compassion and concern for the fate of your people. Is that clear ? Ready, go ! Well done ! Dear Diary, I feel everyone's hopes are with me on this journey. But will I succeed ? Will I be able to bring my people the victory they need ? It's just so strange that as I ready myself to fight for the unity of my country, I seem to have almost lost the unity of my family. Isn't that what I really should be fighting for ? Nando ! You're awake... I couldn't sleep. I keep thinking about this trip... What do you mean ? Missy, I... I need you to be careful. Don't get me wrong, but you do get carried away with your eagerness. Make sure you always take Saint-Aulaire's council. If you want to make a speech or talk to the press, have Brătianu advise you. I mean they're there for you, let them guide you. Just, please, don't improvise. You don't trust me. Nando, but you've agreed to it. It's not that... But... There's so much at stake... Even skilled politicians have failed so far... I won't fail. We can't have doubts now. I am determined to succeed and I will bring results... Nando, you will see... you will see. You're a tough one, aren't you ? Would you like to stay here tonight ? We both need some rest. I will see you in the morning. - Good night. - Good night. Welcome, Your Majesty. - Mr. Mișu, I'm glad to see you again. - The joy and honour are mine, Majesty. - Mr. Brătianu, such pleasure ! - Welcome, Your Majesty. I'm glad to see you again, Mr. Prime Minister. I am a little princess and have a pretty nice tiara. And I would like to be given a little doll. Mother taught me to be well-behaved, and I'm gleeful like a swallow. Dinner with the British ambassador in Paris. Inauguration of Rodin Museum at Hotel Biron. Press conference, reception at our Embassy, opening of my show, reception at Her Ladyship the Marquise de Flers. Unveiling of the Victor Hugo statue ? Meeting Madame Jeanett Lahovary. Reception at Académie des Beaux-Arts. Opening of the Flower Expo ! Mr. Brătianu, how many days is this schedule for ? For the next four days. - Four days ? - Four days and this... ... is a list of those who'd like to be introduced to you as soon as possible: marquises, counts and countesses, also important Americans and English men, also known these days as "businessmen". You'll meet them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But Prime Minister Clemenceau is not on this list. No, he is not. I'm sorry, we haven't been able to schedule an appointment with him yet. Not even the Count of Saint-Aulaire could arrange anything ? He is not here. He's been out of Paris for a few days, but he'll be back tomorrow and... Thank you. - Mr. Brătianu, one moment please. - Your Majesty ! Does me being here in Paris bother you ? Not at all. I want us to be honest with each other. I don't want to meddle in politics, but if I'm to help Romania in any way, I need your full support. I understand. We already have enough enemies, it makes no sense for us to be opponents too. Your Majesty, can count on my loyalty. To be honest, I don't envy you at all. - Thank you. - I thank you. Excuse me... Excuse me. Excuse me... One moment, please... Girls, girls, please. Stop... Put that back, please. Where did these come from ? From me, your Majesty. My name is Alice Alleaume and I am at your service for any wardrobe items you might require for yourself or your daughters. Compliments of Madame Chéruit. Did you know about this ? Yes, Your Majesty. And there are more on the way. Thank you, Madame. I, for one, was quite surprised at the crowds at her reception... I missed it. Did she bring her children ? Is she here for the opening of her play ? It's not a play, it's a ballet ! Well, I heard she's here for shopping, so... No, no, no ! My paper is convinced that she's really here for the Peace Talks. The Peace Talks ? Then what about Brătianu ? What about Brătianu ? Ladies and Gentlemen, Queen Marie de Roumanie ! It is a pleasure to meet you all. On behalf of the French and foreign press, I would like to welcome your Majesty to Paris. Thank you. Please be seated. I'll begin. My name is Gabrielle de Jouvenel, from "Le Matin". Are you here, your Majesty, for the opening night of the show inspired by your fairy tale, "The Lily of Life" ? I'm here to make sure they get it right ! - Thank you, Ma'am. - Your Majesty ! Your Majesty ! Your Majesty, Bernard Fresh, from "The New York Times". Which sights are you planning to visit in Paris ? Instead of landmarks, I'll be visiting people. Kind people, interested in helping my country recover from the horrors of the war. Thank you, Ma'am. Your Majesty ! Your Majesty ! Wickham Steed, Your Majesty, from "The Times" in London. Will you also be taking part in the Peace Talks ? Sadly, no. But please inform the politicians that if they require my advice, I'd be glad to be of assistance. I certainly shall, Ma'am. I believe in England you've already been paying more attention to women since last year. Isn't it time the rest of the world followed suit ? Indeed. Pavel Brătășanu, from La Roumanie. Have you had a chance to talk with Prime Minister Brătianu ? - All in due time. - Thank you. Your Majesty ! Your Majesty ! Valbelle from "Le Journal". So... what is the main purpose of your visit to Paris, your Majesty ? My main purpose is collecting relief for my people. I'm here to appeal to your country's good will and gather as much aid as I can for our new nation. Our soldiers are still fighting on the Transylvanian frontline. On the table please. Thank you. Queen Marie enchanted the reporters The Queen is partying in Paris Foreign Affairs bent by the Home Affairs bypasses Where are the wagons with relief promised by the Queen ? Queen of Romania dazzles the Parisians Queen Marie enchanted the reporters She's very beautiful, don't you think ? Just a woman showing off her wardrobe in Paris. She's nothing like her grandmother ! Queen Victoria, now that was a force to be reckoned with. Some admire her and some criticize her... It's the one thing she'll ever have in common with us politicians. I am under considerable pressure from everyone around me to grant her an audience. She is very persistent. - I feel I'm being hunted down... - You're not the only one... - Your Majesty. - Prime-Minister. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, you've barely just arrived and already Paris is at your feet ! That maybe so, but too little of the news is about my appeal for help. They seem far more interested in my social schedule or my wardrobe... Yet I don't seem to find the same journalistic preoccupation with the clothes of Lloyd-George, Clemenceau or any other official ! - You know what the Americans say... - What do they say ? "Any publicity is good publicity"... Well, I suppose if I wish to be heard, I must first allow myself to be seen. What do you think ? Could we find something for Lisbeth to do here in Paris ? What did you have in mind ? Given her passion for music, maybe she could study singing or piano. - I'll look into it. For how long ? - Until I find her a suitable husband. Contribution to the war and of its great unification. The Romanian-inhabited territories currently under Austro-Hungarian occupation... On behalf of the Supreme Council, it is decided that the special interests of Romania shall be dealt with by dedicated committees. Will the next speaker come forward, please. Gentlemen, how are things at the Peace Talks ? It's a farce, Your Majesty. The Big Four are carving up the map of the world as they please... Since the Ottomans are gone, the new powers are tearing them apart with no consideration for anyone. What about my meeting with Prime Minister Clemenceau ? My apologies, Your Majesty. Please allow me a few more days. Clemenceau seems to be avoiding me. "The Tiger", as they call him, knows exactly what I want from him. The Tiger ? Majesty, you have the connection to Prince Știrbey in Buftea. In a moment. Please arrange that meeting ! Thank you. My dear Barbu ! How are things at home ? Carol has left for Transylvania and Zizi stayed behind in Bucharest. Apparently, she didn't feel up for such a trip. Yes, I talked to Nando yesterday. He was rather tense. The government is holding him responsible for your trip. But I thought everybody had agreed. Yes and no. The opposition is protesting: "The Queen is partying in Paris while the country is starving"... Yes, I read that. Please inform the Government that the first load of relief supplies leaves for Romania tomorrow. Clothing for the poor and food. Medicine and hospital equipment will follow. This will appease them a little. Thank you for being direct, as usual ! I'll talk to you again soon. Good luck ! Thank you. That was Clemenceau's Chief of Staff, General Mordacq. It is impossible, Your Majesty, to spare more than 20 minutes. Please understand. 20 minutes, it's not much. Gentlemen, I need all the information you have on "The Tiger". - Café, Your Majesty ? - Tea, please. My apologies, I keep forgetting where you come from. Bring some tea, please. And how do you find Paris, Your Majesty ? Splendid, but incredibly crowded. Ah, indeed... Mr. Prime Minister, we are very grateful to France for its help during the war. As you know, thousands of our soldiers gave their lives on the frontline. Yet their sacrifice now seems to have been in vain. Romania has traditionally enjoyed the French people's respect and favour, so I was quite surprised to find out that it's far from getting the treatment it deserves at the Peace Talks. Your Majesty, Romania signed the Bucharest Treaty last year with the Germans and that was a faux pas tres sérieux. Therefore, the Allies no longer feel bound to keep their 1916 territorial promises ! Monsieur, I'll remind you that the treaty was signed under German occupation and never ratified by the King ! We were abandoned and surrounded, waiting in vain for help from France and England. Despite everything, we stayed loyal to the Allies. The King even had to go against his own family, Mr. Clemenceau... And you're still holding on to that unofficial treaty with Germany.... Forgive me, Mr. Clemenceau, but I see no point in taking up any more of your limited time. Your Majesty, don't cry. No need to rush these important matters. Please, sit down. For you, I have all the time in the world... Politics is quite an intricate game. But you... you seem to be a quick study, n'est-ce pas ? I have come to you as a simple woman, who happens to be Queen of a country destroyed by war. I hope a man of your position of considerable influence can help me do it justice, Mr. Clemenceau. And justice... Will consist of what, exactly ? Just what is due to us: Transylvania all the way up to the Tisa, Bessarabia, Dobruja and Banat. All territories inhabited by Romanians. That's all ? Bessarabia is a Russian issue. But I think it could be arranged. Dobruja is being discussed and I think Romania is getting it back. Transylvania... is a different matter... Relations with Hungary are deteriorating as we speak. But the whole of Banat ?! You really are claiming the Lion's share, aren't you, Your Majesty ? That is why, Mr. Prime Minister, the Lioness has come to see her first cousin, the Tiger. Even if I can make you no promises, I would like to express my deepest admiration for you. I'm flattered by the admiration, Mr. Clemenceau. But I would've welcomed something more substantial. Thank you for your time, Mr. Prime Minister. My dear Nando, today I had my first great test. I've met with Clemenceau. We were both quite direct with each other, but I'm not sure whether he is willing or even able to help us. Oh, if only you'd been here, with me, I am sure you'd have made him see our plight better than I could. I miss your guidance so much ! It will hopefully go easier with my fellow countrymen. Today I'm meeting Lloyd-George for lunch... Ileana, my love, what happened ? I had a bad dream ! - What did you dream about ? - I can't remember. - It's all right, she'll stay with me. - Good night, Your Majesty. It was only a dream. Now you're with me. All right ? That's what happens in life too, we have bad dreams, but luckily we also have good ones. The secret is to hold on to the good ones and forget the bad ones. Lloyd George planned this table seating on purpose ! You know, I quite agree, these Balkan countries are all the same ! They don't quite know what they want. On the contrary, Mr. Prime Minister, Romania knows exactly what it wants ! You must have heard Mr. Brătianu's speech, at the Peace Talks ! Yes, yes. It was rather a splendid speech ! I heard that you're enjoying a great holiday in Paris, Your Majesty. I'm glad you were fortunate enough to have such good weather. We both know we're not here to talk about the weather, Mr. Prime Minister ! No, no, not quite. Also, I'm told you were honoured at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Congratulations, Ma'am. The question is will the British be honoring the sacrifices made by the Romanian people during the war ? I believe that his Majesty King George the Fifth would be more suited than myself to answer that question. As you well know, my cousin could not be here. That's why I'm directing my plea to you, Sir, to consider Romania's pressing needs. Well, I shall pass along your request. To whom, exactly ? Have you heard about, thank you, the latest discussions about the Arabs ? Apparently, now we're all stuck on an agreement over a couple of acres of desert. I mean it's ridiculous. I would be careful where you draw your lines, Mr. Prime Minister, the consequences might still be felt a hundred years from now. Thank you for your generous lunch invitation. Unfortunately, we must take our leave now. Other delegations await us, people taking a serious interest in the fate of Romania. Anyone for more wine ? Your Majesty. Your Majesty. How was the meeting ? Your Majesty ! Paris loves you ! How can I help you ? Your Majesty ! The Peace Treaty is drafted by The Four, US, UK, France, Italy, and submitted to be signed to the delegates. Elena... please see to my luggage. We're leaving for London. Sure, Your Majesty. You really are claiming the lion's share, aren't you, Your Majesty ? Don't improvise. But if you were to join this fight... Will the British be honoring the sacrifices made by the Romanian people during the war ? His Majesty King George the Fifth would be more suited than myself to answer that question. My dear May, it's been ages since we've spent time together... It has, oh, it has... But tell me, Marie, how is Paris, these days ? Awfully crowded... Remember the Expo ? Three times as crowded... Because of the bloody Germans. They've nearly destroyed Europe. I'm the boy to do 'em all, here's a stick to thump Old Nick, if he by chance upon me call huzzah, huzzah, the Devil's dead. That's the way to do it ! Sure, ask him ! Why is your name Windsor ? Come here, little princess and I'll explain. Go, go ! That's right. Now, during the war, the Germans bombed London with a big plane called Gotha G.IV... And that sounded like part of our name. - Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ! - Well done ! Now, because of the war, nobody really likes the Germans over here. So two years ago, we decided to change our name to Windsor. It's always the blasted Krauts ! Nothing but trouble ! My dear, I should remind you that you, too, have German blood. We've been Windsor's for quite some time now ! We are not, nor will we ever be Germans again ! We're through with that, it's a new era for our family ! - But why Windsor ? - Well, it's a beautiful castle. So when you marry, you'll live there with your wife ? Well... If she so chooses. And who will choose her, your parents ? Well, little Princess, I intend to choose my future wife myself. And we've not heard the last of it, I can tell you that ! Did you know it's Nicky's exeat, so he'll be here on Saturday ? Oh, that's wonderful ! Aren't you lovely ? Wonderful to see you. Mignon. Enjoying your time in London ? I do. Thank you. May, I've been thinking, might we find an appropriate school for Mignon here in London ? Well, I'll gladly look into it. I'm certain we can find her something she'd like. Go on, Marie... What's troubling you ? Romania's suffered terribly during the war, and in a way, that's your fault too. We counted on England's help when we were under siege ! Sadly, we were unable to do anything... I'm not asking you to turn back time. But I am asking you to help us now ! You know, I quite envy you. Such passion... fighting for your Romania ! George, please don't patronize me. You, too, fight for your country. Yes, but I was born here ! I've inherited the crown from my family, all born here, for generations. I am familiar with the customs, the political games, the outlook and character of those around me... But you ? You bound yourself to a completely foreign country... And you've given your very heart to it ! George, do something to help us ! You know there's very little I can do. We're a constitutional monarchy, just like yours. I suppose I could talk to your old friend, Churchill. But, Marie, please, in future, prevent your politicians from signing anymore treaties with the... with the Germans. Thank you, George. Thank you. And then I said "oh, don't speak to me like that, you remind me my of first husband" ! Thank you. Thank you for coming. - Marie, darling ! - Nancy ! I'm so happy to see you again ! Thank you ! Oh, no, thank you ! - Joe, my dear friend ! - Your Majesty ! You are more and more beautiful every year ! And you, Joe, more and more charming ! Nancy, where's Waldorf ? I thought he was coming with you... No, unfortunately, he wasn't feeling very well. He said to say he's sorry. Now, you must tell me what you've achieved in Paris so far. Not much, I'm afraid. It feels like pushing against a brick wall... Darling, it's high time women voiced their opinions directly ! I, for one, won't stop until I have my seat in the London Parliament ! Marie, you should be explaining what must be done to your country, but in an official capacity, not in drawing rooms, restaurants and hotels ! - Your Majesty... - Thank you. Monarchs cannot do what politicians can. You know this, it is the same thing here. So, who's been giving you the greatest trouble ? Who hasn't ?! Lloyd George arrogantly ignores me. Clemenceau's hiding behind his politeness, and Wilson's simply unreachable. You must make Lloyd George face your authority as Queen. All Englishmen are alike: scold them sternly and they bow to the higher rank. What about Wilson, Mr. Boyle ? Well, on the one hand, he is a known conservative. But on the other, he has great respect for energetic women who are not afraid to fight for their ideas. And Your Majesty is definitely a strong woman. Politics is such an intricate game... It is, indeed, darling, and you cannot play the game unless you've mastered the rules. Well, I, for one, am absolutely certain you will play to win. Friends and guests, gather round ! Gather round ! I'd like to introduce to you a dear friend. The fearless adventurer... The daring archaeologist... The successful entrepreneur... and the all around gallant warrior... Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. Joe Boyle ! No sacrifice is too great for Your Majesty ! Joe, I really need your help. Well, I am completely at your service. But, right now, I wanna teach you a new dance. Ok. One, two, three. Come this way. And again. Very nice. My Marie, I don't want to worry you, but I must be honest. The Hungarian danger in Transylvania has worsened. The Hungarian Bolsheviks have crossed the border and are devastating whole towns and villages. The King has already called on General Berthelot for military assistance. We may have to bring Carol back to Bucharest. Try to win as many allies as possible for the Romanian cause, otherwise our country will unravel. I admire you with all my heart. I love you, my Marie." - And he has a castle. - Yes, a big and beautiful one. - And what is his name ? - His name is David. "David" is a wonderful name. - I am very happy. - Me too. Aaah, Nicky ! Nicky ! How are you ? - One day I'll marry David. - Oh yeah ? - Hello, Mother. - Nicky ! Look at you... So handsome now ! Have a seat, have a seat ! Finally, we can talk in peace. It's so stuffy here with George around... - Actually, I quite like it. - What do you mean ? Exactly what I've just said. I like it here, at Eton. I've actually made some friends and I don't wish to return to Romania. Why ? Because, over here it's as if there's never even been a war ! It's so civilized ! I hated those dreadful war years, that miserable exile in Iași... Why would I ever want to return to that poor, ugly, backward country ?! What would I do in Bucharest, surrounded by petty politicians who spend their days bickering ? My own brother has no love for me, Mother. Do you expect me to wait until he acts on that ?! Girls let's go for a while ! Ileana ! I have no future in that dump of a country, Mother ! I don't recognize you anymore ! Of course I'm glad you're happy here, in England. I'm not surprised you feel that way about the war and our refuge. May even understand how you feel about your brother... But don't ever disrespect your country again ! Your Majesty, Prime Minister Brătianu. Thank you. Your Majesty ! - Mr. Brătianu, please, take a seat. - Thank you, I would rather stand. How's it going with the Peace Talks ? Nobody dares say anything as long as the American president is not convinced. When he opens his mouth, they all fall silent. - How come ? - Your Majesty... For months now it's been the same routine: every day we go to Quai d'Orsay, as all the other delegations. Everyone reiterates their wishes, and their claims over and over again. We negotiate, cite historical examples, put pressure and what do they do ? Eat, drink, smoke and simply ignore us and there goes another day with no progress, no decision ! Please forgive my temper. To be honest, I wish I could resign. Mr. Brătianu, I've been here much less time and achieved even less than you, but believe me I would resign too, if only I could. Your Majesty, a telegram from Lloyd George ! Open it, please ! He's requesting an audience ! He is waiting for you tomorrow at noon, at the restaurant "Le Tour D'Argent". - No, no, no. - Your Majesty... Please tell him we will meet here, at the same time, in the Reception Hall ! Yes, Your Majesty. Welcome, Mr. Lloyd George. Do have a seat. Would you like some tea ? Or perhaps something stronger ? A cup of tea would be very nice, thank you. I understand there's an emergency, Your Majesty ? We have discussed the present situation, both with King George and with Mr. Churchill. We've all found time to arrive at a satisfactory understanding of Romania's political circumstances. I believe you are up-to-date on this information as well. The emergency is unchanged: the acknowledgement of a United Romania. I have promised Mr. Churchill that I would look into your country's affairs. - Splendid. And ? - Well... in principle... Most of my colleagues are of the opinion that a united Romania would bring stability to the region... especially in light of the Bolshevik threat. So now that you fully grasp the point we've been making for the past three months, what still seems to be the problem ? Ah, well... You see, Ma'am... President Wilson... He seems to have a rather intractable opinion of Romania... Are you saying that it is the American president's authority you defer to ? Erm, I wouldn't quite put it in those terms, Your Majesty. It's complicated. There are many subtle diplomatic differ.. I'm quite familiar with diplomacy ! What I want to know is where Britain stands on the Romanian issue ! We are giving it the utmost priority, Your Majesty ! Good ! Thank you, Prime Minister. I must say I've quite enjoyed our conversation, Sir. We look forward to your strong support of the Romanian cause. And one more thing. I am Queen Victoria's granddaughter. Never forget that. Well, that was rather interesting. Mr. Mișu ! - Any answer from President Wilson ? - Unfortunately not yet, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, if I may. There's a meeting with the war invalids at the French-American Atelier today. The American first lady, Edith Wilson, is the guest of honor. Your Majesty ! May I introduce to you a dear friend ? Of course, Mr. Moscovici. This is Mr. Nelson Cromwell, the founder of this charity. How do you do, Mr. Cromwell. Your Majesty. Such an honour ! I was hoping I'd be lucky enough to make your acquaintance ! Well, Mr. Cromwell, your charitable initiative has my unconditional respect ! Thank you, Your Majesty ! I would like to introduce to you our First Lady. By all means, Mr. Cromwell, I'd be delighted. Please. Your Majesty, Mrs. Edith Wilson, the First Lady of the United States of America. Mrs. Wilson, Her Majesty, Queen Marie of Romania. Such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Wilson. Oh, the pleasure's mine, Your Majesty. I hear you fight fiercely on behalf of your Romania. I try. Mrs. Wilson, I'd like to be honest with you. I came here today because I need your support. Of course. How can I help, Your Majesty ? Ever since I've arrived to Paris, I've been trying, unsuccessfully so far, to meet with your husband... I wouldn't want to impose, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word for me. Consider it done. I'll make sure my husband finds time to sit down with Queen Marie, the heroine of Romania. - Thank you. - Oh, a photo, why not ? I thought Loie Fuller was amazing ! I really loved your fairy tale, Your Majesty ! She was splendid, wasn't she ? No, no, coffee, coffee. Now, I understand, Mr. President, that your time is very limited, so please allow me to say a few things right away. First of all, how much I admire your visionary idea of the League of Nations. It is a vital project for the future peace of the world. It's one of my special projects. And it's essential, especially for small countries. Which we hope will remain small... The League of Nations will help give a new sense of "strength in numbers" to countries facing the post-war chaos, especially with the Bolshevik threat. And I would like to remind you of the vital role of a strong Greater Romania in fighting that threat. The topic of the Romanian unification has already been broached several times at the Peace Talks. However, your Minister, um, what's his name... Ion Brătianu. Yes, him, and the French and the English have failed to convince me. And now, with all respect, you think you can change my mind ?! Don't you feel it's best to continue as the Queen all the journalists love and admire, and leave politics to the politicians ? I can imagine, Mr. President, how overwhelmed you must be with dozens of requests every day, and how it's not always easy to make the right decisions. Yes, you're right. For months now we've been receiving delegations from so many different countries. They all want new borders but most of their demands are purely utopian ! As a matter of fact, Europe would be much better off as a federation, like our United States of America. One congress, one president, a lot fewer problems ! Exactly ! That's why the simplest solution is to acknowledge Greater Romania ! Especially since that's what our people want. And what about your ethnic minorities, Your Majesty ? I've heard heard you have a lot of trouble with those. Troublesome minorities are a reality everywhere... No, no, no, I'm talking about Romania, about your minorities and about granting them Romanian citizenship ! I'm sure you're familiar with Mr. Brătianu's report and you recall that we've had these issues during the German occupation. By now all the minorities have already been granted their rights. Look, why don't you see for yourself ? I'd love for you and your wife to visit my country. Of course, I'd much rather welcome you to a peaceful and unified Romania. Well, I don't think that that's entirely appropriate at the moment... It's a wonderful country, Mr. President. From the gently sloping mountains to the Danube Delta, from the old fortresses to the magnificent Northern monasteries... Not to mention all of our natural riches: fertile lands, virgin forests, waters and lots and lots of oil. I see. Well, if your country is so rich, why are your people starving ?! Because the riches of my country have been plundered by the Germans ! And now, the Bolshevik danger could spread all over Europe like the plague. I'll remind you that only last year, they wiped out the Romanoff family, part of my family ! So it's in the interest of all European nations as well as your United States to stop them. And you see why I cannot and will not rest until I've saved my country from hardship ! With or without your help ! You sure can drive your point home, Your Majesty. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Nando... I was meaning to call you but... You "were meaning" to call me ?! I'm sorry, what do you mean ? When exactly were you planning to tell me that you've agreed to have our daughters move to other countries ? And that yet you've taken it solely upon yourself to decide their fate ?! Well, I never thought you had such an interest in these matters... Well, you thought wrong ! I do have an interest ! Don't you think you have higher concerns than where Mignon and Lisbeth are being educated ? My concern right now is you taking too many decisions on your own ! Remember that your first priority is to be a good mother to your children ! Nando, what is this really about ? I feel so isolated, Missy. My Prime Minister has been away for months. I spend my days waiting for news and my nights alone, thinking the same thoughts over and over. I need you here, Missy, by my side. I hear you, Nando. I'm coming home. Thank you, my dear friend. You've been a great support to our cause. I knew you'd conquer Paris. - Thank you, Mr. Brătianu. - Your Majesty. Mr. Prime Minister... What an honour to see you again ! The honor is all mine ! Paris will always welcome you. Perhaps I'll return in happier times. Cheer up, Your Majesty ! You've made quite an impression here, maybe more than you think. And let me add one piece of advice, from the Tiger to the Lioness: never give up the fight. Thank you. I have given our country a lively image ! I have Woodrow Wilson's, Clemenceau's and Lloyd Georges's promises they will reconsider their positions regarding Greater Romania. And we returned, as you know, with many carloads of food and equipment. Bravo ! Bravo, Mother. Weren't you expecting applauses ? I thought you were. Let's see... you've come back from Paris with politicians' promises. And you believed them ? Even worse, you expect us to believe them too ? Let me tell you the truth about your trip, Mother. It was useless ! What's worse, while you were gallivanting all over Paris, we were still fighting here, in Transylvania ! Maybe you were too busy parading your new clothes in fancy restaurants. Well let me tell you, Béla Kun and his Bolsheviks have reached Budapest and are slaughtering people left and right ! How's that for "a lively image", Mother ? You mean, no one told you ? Perhaps they were afraid of ruining your party. But I'm telling you now: your trip was an utter waste of time and money ! Does everyone here agree with that ? What's wrong, father ? Are you angry too ? Leave me alone, please. "Dear Nando, I believe it best for both of us that I stay at Pelișor for a while. That way, I can be alone with my thoughts and examine the situation more closely. I came back from the toughest battle of my life, tougher than the exile, the war, the frontline hospitals, ... and I dare to think I had won. In Paris I faced superficiality, maliciousness, disdain and dishonesty, all without a flinch, because I knew how much my people needed my victory... And when I finally achieved it and brought it home like a precious gift, my own son and husband crushed me more painfully than all the indifference I had to bear in Paris. Too many times have I yielded to your needs, to your wishes, Nando. Too many times I listened to my sense of duty and to my belief in the team we used to be, you and I. Not anymore. Now I will take what I need, time and distance, for as long as I need it. And in the end, I will hopefully, see a suitable course of action." Come, come ! - Have you been to the forest ? - Yes. - And what have you found ? - Snails and flowers. - What else ? - More flowers. - Have you had a good time ? - Yes. - And what have you picked ? - Flowers. And what else ? Let's go, girls. Before you say anything, please listen to me. I know you need distance. I know you're hurt and disappointed. You made that clear in your letter. But... can we talk about it ? You know what the irony is, Missy ? They all admire us, but they have no idea of what we had to go through to get here... It wasn't even our decision to get married. We barely knew each other, remember ? I wasn't even supposed to be on this throne. Then we had to come to this foreign country... Uncle Carol... The war... But all in all I think we have done quite well. We have five healthy children. And, most importantly, we've stayed together. Listen, Missy... I'm sorry that I was unfair to you. You deserved more. You deserve all the admiration and love in the world. If truth be told, I am quite grateful to have you in my life, as my partner, as the mother of my children, as my Queen. I... I admire your confidence and your energy... I suppose what I'm trying to say is... I love you, Missy. In my own way, but with all my heart. And I do believe that hand in hand we are stronger. However, there's one more thing I've come to tell you. What is it ? I have great news from Paris, from Saint-Aulaire. Things seem to be turning in our favor. Against all odds, we have succeeded ! You have won, Missy, you have won ! Now you tell me ?! Well, if I told you that first, you wouldn't have heard the rest. In June 1919 the Treaty of Versailles brought World War I to an end. The Allied Powers acknowledged the Union of all Romanian territories. In June 1920 after hundreds of years the dream of a united Romania had finally come true. At that time, Romania had reached its widest borders ever. In October 1922 in Alba Iulia King Ferdinand and Queen Marie were crowned Monarchs of Greater Romania.
