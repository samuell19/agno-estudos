There's a loose kite. Ouch! My father always said, "Juki, when you grow up, you have to be a successful person." "For that, Juki must learn to live the simple life." "Be an honest and brave child." One, two, three, four, five. "Hang out with anyone. Don't be picky." "God created everything equally." "And most importantly, Juki, don't just be a follower." "Dare to be different." "A child who makes his own way". Juki. Honey! - Honey! - Gosh. What is it? You screamed during the day. My ears hurt. Look at Juki, honey. Gosh. Juki! Quick, get down from there. - Help my son. - Get him down, honey. Please, help him down. Slowly. Be careful. Watch out. There is a wall. SI JUKI THE MOVIE END OF THE DAY COMMITTEE Viewers. Welcome to the starry night at the Masamie Awards. Tonight we will witness the awards that will be given to domestic stars for their achievements in the Indonesian entertainment world.

It's blurred out. - Watch what you say. - Juki, Mommy's son. Juki! REJECT LOCAL CELEBRITIES Hurry up, Juki. There's a long line. I thought it's still slow motion. Watch out, it's hot. To present the top award tonight, we ask for the presence on stage of the Managing Director of Ganjar Group, and Chairman of the Prosperous Affluent Party, the honorable Mr. Doctor, Engineer, Doctorate, Veterinarian, Dentist, sir, Raden Kanjeng Ganjar Ginanjar. Bachelor of Law. Good evening, honorable ladies and gentlemen. And that which honors me back. All Indonesian people who love me. Let's celebrate together the glittering world of entertainment in our country. Cricket, don't be noisy. Okay. Please focus back on me. That's right. And the most popular celebrity of 2017 is... I'll open it, okay? Why are you silent? Waiting for me? Juki. Thank you to Tomi, my mother, my father, my auntie, my uncles, siblings, neighbors, all village and sub-district officials in place. And the last, the most important, for all Juki's Buddy and friends who are always loyal and support me. Therefore, I will present this trophy for you. Okay. Go get it. Ready? Come on! Class, this is great. - This is Dr. Erin Pratama. - Hello? The youngest Head of Space R&D Division that Indonesia has ever had. Ms. Erin, can you tell us how you got involved in this field? Ma'am! Wait. You'll have time for questions. Please, Ms. Erin. Okay. Thank you. After I finished studying astronomy at one of the colleges, I got a scholarship to continue my education in America. - Where I... - Ma'am! Joni! - Please continue, Ms. Erin. - Okay. I got a Doctor of Science degree in Astronomy. Then, about a year ago, I returned to Indonesia. - Furthermore, I work in... - Ma'am! You were told to listen. Don't be a naughty kid. Shame on you, Joni. And now, I work here. DADDY - Hello? - Greetings. - Greetings. - Juk, what are you doing? Daddy? Cleaning my saliva. What's up? Nothing. Your mom told me to remind you. Don't forget tomorrow afternoon. There is a thanksgiving here. - Celebrating what you won yesterday. - Okay, Daddy. By the way, Juk. Can I borrow some money again? I will repay it. Don't worry. Because I have a new "repairment". - What? - New "repairment". - Do you mean "investment"? - Right. That. But don't tell your mother. Yes, Daddy. Relax. You don't need to repay it. I'll transfer, Daddy. - Great. Okay. See you tomorrow, Juk. - Okay. - Don't forget about it, okay? - I will, Daddy. Relax. - Greetings. - Greetings. Finally, I can do the repairment. Honey, ask him. He wants bolognaise or carbonara for the stinky beans? Gosh. Are there no other foods? You've given him stinky beans since he was a baby. It smells. You know? But he likes stinky beans a lot. - Maybe the steak or something. - Stinky beans steak. - Or lion steak? - Stinky beans lion steak. - Everything is stinky beans? - Yes. Juki. Juki. Come on, be serious. He'll fly to my face. What is it, Cong? That! Taro, don't be naughty. Uncle Congky got scared. Crazy roach. He just wants to play, Cong. - Don't mind it. - Play by yourself. Don't take me. You jerk! Cong, I want to find a toy for the roach. - Are you coming? - I can't. - I'm going to Bazuki. - Why are you going there? Open the stand. My horror comic is finally published. If I don't come, they'll be waiting. - Okay. I'm coming with you. - Sure. Where is your roach? Why I can't see it? It was with you earlier. I want to rinse my mouth first. GENERAL BAZAAR INDIE COMICS I feel like going home when coming here. Here, me and Faza pioneered our career. - Buy the comics. - Selling comics with our own funds. Now, it's my turn. Do you think only you can become famous? Ghost! Sorry, I'm late. Let me introduce him. My friend. Juki. - Hello? - Hello, brother. Come. Let's find something to eat. Cong, where is that kuntilanak from? - He's quite huge. - Who? Bowo? He's a genderuwo. From Kendal. Well, this is cosplay, Juk. Gosh. No wonder. CONGKY DENIED FROM ETERNAL REST Don't touch or open it. - That comic is expensive. Millions. - Millions, uncle? Too steep. Imported or local? Imported or local. Do you think I sell cows? - The story is about you? - Of course. The picture is good, right? Yes. The picture is good. But, sorry, you're not good enough, uncle. You're who isn't good enough. Impudence. Hey, ghost. Don't ask if you won't buy. How come a ghost throws mud at another ghost? Hey, shorty, go get circumcised first. Cong, I want to go upstairs. Hey, you jerk, arcade joystick. Watch your language, unwashed food stall curtains. What did you say? Indie comic fans, where are your voices? Louder! Where is the voice of anti-mainstream fans? Okay. In this session, there will be a young artist who pioneered his career here. And then booming and influencing our generation. His works are always authentic. Original. Unique. A genius artist of this age. Let's welcome Hari Zein. Serial comic artist... Thank you. The comic artist of comedy comic series of the Zein Days. What time is my show? Sorry, Juk. This year we did not send invitations to you or Faza. It's okay. We don't need the invitation. No. I mean, look. For guest speakers, we always choose fresh artists. A little bit of edgy and outside the mainstream. Thank you. The problem is you, Juk. You're too mainstream to us. Your style is widely followed by others. Your shows have more sales than content. People here aren't looking for that. They are looking for something unique. And you're not unique anymore, Juk. Jek, help me get rid of the crow. You get it, right? - Mr. Anto! - Be patient. Please be patient. Don't just take it. I don't have late payments. Nobody's here. So, it's you, Ms. Erin. I was very startled. I thought you were the debt collector. - What can I help, ma'am? - The indicator light is on. Our astronomical radar is catching something. This one? This one has been on, ma'am. The computer seems to need replacing. No. The system's still analog. It is unlikely that this is wrong. Try increasing the transceiver's power. Sure, ma'am. The signal is too weak. Image result is not clear. Mr. Anto, please increase the radar sensitivity. Lower the frequency by half to reduce noise. So we get more accurate object data. I was about to suggest that. Contact NASA, the Russian and Chinese Space Agency. Find out what they know. Focus all staff to monitor the object's movements. Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Yeti, if you're there, contact NASA immediately. Mr. Dwi, if you're there, contact Russia. Mr. Asep, if you're there, open relations with China. Look for as much info. Why is everything "If you're there"? Right. I forget. They all resigned yesterday, ma'am. They don't receive salary for ten months. They almost couldn't make it. They all resigned. Then why are you still here? Well, here's the thing, ma'am. I am retiring in two years. If I resign now, that'll be bad. The benefits will be forfeit. No money, no house, I'll be nomadic. I will suffer, ma'am. AIRING EVERYDAY AT 7:00 P.M. I think we need something new, Za. - There are many shows like us. - It sells. Can't get over the Bazuki incident? Don't listen to him. But we made it because we're different, Za. Free to say anything. Not afraid of censors, thinking about sponsors, ratings, or whatever. Now, you can't say this, you can't say that. - Too many ads. - I don't think so. Guys, which one do you prefer? Juk, remember to lift the product when you say the catchphrase. Okay? My daddy always said, don't follow other people. Following others is an ordinary thing. This is usual, Za. We need something different. Something that's extraordinary. Oh, my God. See? I forgot there was a family thanksgiving event. I have to go. See you. You're leaving just like that? Viewers, the government confirms this is not due to a terrorist attack, foreign states or alien. However, is this a natural phenomenon? Further investigation is underway by the State Space Agency. I'm surprised. There are always problems. As usual. Diversion of issues. The election is coming up. Finished? Change it, Uncle. - The K-drama is about to start. - You always watch that. Study so you can get smarter. I'm already in top ranks. Sorry, Uncle. - Where is Uncle Juned? - Don't know. I invited him. Maybe he's at the back as usual. That's how smart people are. They always incubate like turkeys. - They don't hang out. - Jul, take this to your father. Auntie, I was about to watch. Cool it. Let me take that. Uncle? Uncle? Uncle? It's Juki. Uncle! Come on in, Juk. Uncle! Wait. What was I saying? - Uncle! - What? You talk to yourself. What are you up to? That's it. I remember. I'm researching new fuel from duck droppings extract. Every amount must be exact, Juk. Okay, Uncle. I don't understand either. Uncle, you don't watch the news? -There are many shooting stars -What? Shooting stars? Where? There was one in my office. Viewers, we just received a report that Indonesia was hit by asteroid rain. Many people gathered to see... This is so fresh. But it's a little bitter. - What is this drink? - That's not a drink. That's the extract I said just now. - Did you drink it? - Yup. Gosh. What's happening, Uncle? But it feels like... In movies, if you experience something like this, you will become a superhero. Perhaps... You drink without asking. What do you feel in your body now? Nothing, Uncle. I feel more refreshed. It feels like... Please, move aside, Uncle. - What are you doing? - Wait a second, Uncle. Oh, my God! Don't! You really are something else. But I feel something is different, Uncle. Like there is super energy flowing. But what is it? A collection of fallen meteorites in our area this afternoon is a fraction of a larger asteroid. And this object is estimated to be around one km in diameter. It's relatively small but still capable of extraordinary disasters. Which can destroy all of Indonesia. Wait a minute. It's a joke, right? Try to explain to me again correctly, precisely, and accurately. Unfortunately, this is very serious, sir. We confirmed with the space agencies of America, Russia, and China. And it is true. Now, are you sure this only affects our territory? Affirmative, sir. Our calculations confirmed it, sir. Only Indonesian territory will be affected. Southeast Asia of course. - No, sir. - Malaysia? - No, sir. - Singapore? Certainly not, sir. Only in Indonesia. Then, when is it estimated to impact? In precisely 40 days, sir. This makes no sense. This is either an extraordinary coincidence or... A curse! A curse! A curse! - This is a curse for this nation. - It's terrifying. Indonesian people must immediately rely on American power. And to listen to nature again. That's where you will get the answer. - It's terrifying, right? - Listen. Listen. How can we listen to the sounds of nature, Grandpa? All methods of listening to nature sounds. I've recorded it on my latest CD called Gendeng. The first 100 buyers will get a bottle of Gendeng water. Which I have proven myself. It's able to raise your bank accounts balance. CD Compilation of Forecasting and Listening to Nature Mbah Gendeng can be found at pedestrian bridges. - Okay? - Okay. Interruptions. What if we use all the nuclear missiles we have to destroy the asteroid before entering Earth's orbit? - That's right... - Like in what movie, huh? Now, that's the correct one. A nuclear explosion will only damage the surface of it this big, not destroying it. Besides, we don't have nuclear missiles, sir. I know. What if we make giant trampoline? Which will be put in the asteroid's path to deflect it. - Seriously? - I didn't think of that. - That's good. - Now, that's good. Creative. Whatever the tool is, we need a space shuttle to bring it into space. Well, then. If technology can't do it, we call the rain handling community throughout Indonesia. - How's that? - That's right. We must try first. I have contacts if needed. What can we do if it's like this? Please, knock on the door first. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, I forgive you all for being so noisy. I'll cut in. I came to offer a solution For the problem that you are facing. The name of that solution is "Garuda Jaya". - Everybody, start working. - Yes, sir. What's this? Good afternoon, Ms. Erin. They are Garuda Jaya's ground crew. During the mission, this room will be the mission control room. And this is Mr. John Bram, who from now on will be your leader as the Head of Garuda Jaya Mission. Mr. John, I'm Dr. Erin Pratama. The Head of R&D here. I hope we can work well together. - For the success... - The mission design. Study it. Also prepare a room for my office. You! Make me a black coffee. With a little sugar. Make it quick. Gosh. Call the astronaut when you sit here. Everyone must have time to talk. The sponsor's slogan is new. You will see it in teleprompter. In the second session, the astronaut's family comes to give a surprise. Give your emotional side. Make it overdramatic. But from a unique perspective. Like you usually do. A unique perspective. Viewers, things are getting more critical. The entire community is called upon to support the launch of Garuda Jaya. GANJAR GINANJAR "INDONESIA IS SAVED" SIMULATION FAILED Mr. John! Mr. John! Pardon me. This is serious. Can I have a moment of your time? - We need to talk, sir. - What is it now, Ms. Erin? Sir, with all due respect. I think there are errors in calculation on the mission design you made. - Especially about... - You think? You know, this design was made based on the design of NASA's experts. I'm not saying their designs are wrong. But it is more about the numbers in the calculations. There are many discrepancies. The cause for wrong configuration results. I checked it many times and the result... So, my calculations are wrong and you are right? No. Yes. Look, sir. I think we should review it. Just to make sure. Ms. Erin, we are in a critical situation here. There's not much time to save this country. So, we have no time to theorize. What is needed now is real action. But, sir... GARUDA JAYA TRAINING GOVT. APPOINTS JOHN BRAM TO LEAD Extraordinary. Our space heroes. As we saw just, they have to train harder physically. Because they only eat Masamie every day. JUKI'S DORM Like those living in boarding house. There are several questions that came in. From social media, Owl Post, to anonymous letters. Okay. Let me see first. This one is standard. Ordinary. Well, here's a question from Yono. A level 14 student, from the FOE, Department of Food Secretariat. I'll read it, okay? What special preparations are made for this mission? A good question. If I look into it, these astronauts, they could do tours to 25 cities in a week and appeared on 18 TV shows. But the promos are too many. When will the album launch? Okay, boarding boy. Maybe our guests are saving their energy before leaving. For the sake of all of us, I hope this mission will be a success. The aircraft can glide and catapult the name of the "Mister". What are you doing? Do you think he's your father? Don't you know who made all this? He is, right? I was just called by "Mister". He expressed his opinion about the show just now. Then, what does the "Mister" think? PRODUCER'S ROOM Za, I thought of an idea for a comic. About asteroids that eat instant noodles. What do you think? So, it came to Earth. Then humans are enslaved to make instant noodles for it. What do you think? - No, Juk. - Yes, that's right. It's not good enough. Must be more different. What is it, then? Different. Different. Different. We did it, Juk. We have number one show, millions of fans. But it's still not enough for you. You have to be the most unique. What for? - Because being unique is a trend? - But... You can't please everyone, Juk. There's always someone who dislikes it. What we have is more than enough. Now it's all gone. Hey, Juk. What do you think? My idea is good, right? This is great. Is this your own idea? That's why. This is unusual, right? I'm surprised that your Daddy can think. Well, you see at that time, Daddy was negotiating with Somad. Grandpa's young wife is rich. She has land everywhere. Told to be used as a business. I said, "Why not build a boarding house?" - Right, Daddy. - Right? Now, what do you think? "Presses" of Si Juki's boarding house. - "Presses". - "Presses". What? Do you mean "franchise"? Yes. That's right. Franchise. Not "presses", darling. You really bring good luck, Juki. I'm proud of you, Juk. Then, what about us? So, hear this. The promotion can be done on your show. What do you think? Agree. For that, there's a little problem, Daddy. - What other problem? - Right. How come it becomes a problem? I don't have any TV shows anymore. I got fired yesterday. Why did you get fired? Issues of principle, Mom. But Mommy and Daddy don't need to worry. Maybe becoming an actor was not my destiny. I feel different these past few days. It seems like there is something bigger that I have to do. Something that I'll be remembered for. What is that something, Juk? That's what I have to find out, Mommy. Where's Daddy? Hello? Are you Juki? - It could be. - I'm Erin Pratama from the Space Agency. Do you have a minute? MASAMIE - MELODRAMATIC Sorry. I only have this. So, as I said earlier, I tested many times and the results remain the same. This mission will fail if we use the existing configuration. Yeah. Okay. And then? I tried speaking to the program leader. But it is very difficult. I tried through the press. But... You know, in the midst of this euphoria, no one wants to hear bad news. I see. Okay. I understand. So, you came here to ask me to help you to... To what? Look. You are very critical. The number one TV show in Indonesia. Watched by millions of people. If you can convey this fact on your TV show, the public's pressure should stop this mission for a while. Or at least we can correct it first. Gosh. When I don't have a TV show anymore, many people need help. Seriously? You don't have a TV show? But wasn't it last night... Turns out being too critical is not good for the career. Everything will be destroyed. Really, of the many smart people, nobody noticed it? It's useless to be smart but to have no voice. Nobody listens. But, I know a smart person whose voice is loud. Uncle? Got you. Come on in. Hey, you know what? What happened yesterday, it actually is... Wait. There's a guest outside. - A guest is outside. - Let her in. - Let's go outside. - Yeah. Well, Erin. This is Prof. Juned. Prof. Juned. This is Erin. Okay. Please, come on in. By the way, what do you do, miss? I'm a... Wait, let me see. Juned equals to professor. That's it. A professor. That is me. From your face, it looks like you are also smart. What is your name again? Wait. Let me write it down. Move a bit more, Jul. Watch out, don't step on the cords. Yes, Daddy. Relax. You're too bossy. Okay. Juk, sit here. Sit straight, don't tilt. Don't bend. Straight, upright 90 degrees. If you can't, I'll straighten your back with a protractor. Straight. Protractor. Let me write it down. Back. Enforcing bow. Back. Just write it down. We talk while I work. Okay, miss? - What are you gonna do to me, Uncle? - Stinky bean, Juk. - Where? Give me some. - Not that. The reason why you didn't die yesterday after drinking the duck droppings extract. Remember? That's because of the stinky bean. The level of stinky bean on your body is very high. It's not normal. When mixed with yesterday's extract, it mutates into an energy. Do you know? Are you serious, Uncle? So, what power do I have, Uncle? It is very likely that... there isn't any power, Juk. But for sure, I have to take your body extract. - Okay? - Okay. So, what is it? What can I do for you, miss? I do the research from small, big, medium. In fact, I also research the supernatural science. Well, I am Erin Pratama from the Space Agency. Sorry, I dozed off. Have you told him? - What did he say? - Finished. We recalculated it together. He agreed that there was a miscalculation by John Bram. - Then, what now? - Here's what. How was it? Well, like this. So, first. We must replace the wrong mission calculations with Ms. Erin's calculation. This computer data must be entered into a central computer. Wait. What central? The Space Agency's central computer. Right! If the data has been entered into it, it will surely be followed. Is it correct? Now, how do we enter the data there? Right. How do you get past dozens of guards accompanied by trained dogs. SIMULATION SUCCESS Actually no. There are only security guards. Here's the thing. The central computer access requires a password. And only one person knows it. Program leader. John Bram. I know. First, we must create a distraction. SEPTIC TANK PUMPING SERVICE Hey! Use the back door! Why not ask first? Hey, guys. Target is on site. I repeat. Target is on site. Hurry. Okay. Relax. INPUT SECRET PASSWORD DATA ROOM Juk, where were you? What took you so long? Too many obstacles, Cong. - What is the password? - Password. Wait. - Hurry! - Twelve... Then, 34. - And, then? - Fifty-six. Seventy-eight. - Gosh. Cong. - You're right. Come on, just run away. Damn it!

PUBLIC ORDER ENFORCERS POLICE TERRITORIAL BORDER We're safe. What's going on? I don't know. Where is Mr. John? He hasn't been seen since the incident, sir. Look at this CCTV footage, sir. Juki? Juki. Could it be Ms. Erin deliberately wanted to crash the plane? She said she had studied abroad. Don't tell me she's a spy. Impossible. Understand? Because it's not in my notes. If anyone has been suspicious since then, I must have written it down. This is all my fault. The calculation I made was wrong. I made the spacecraft crash. And the worst thing is... I dragged all of you into this mess. The search has begun. JUKI AS A SUSPECT To find Juki that was allegedly recruited by KETIR... LOCAL TERRORIST GROUP ...also known as the Radical Terrorist group... GARUDA JAYA MISSION FAILED ...to sabotage the Garuda Jaya mission. Juki is suspected of doing this in desperation after being fired from his TV show a few days ago. The police released a CCTV video which shows that Juki was inside the Space Agency headquarters the night before the incident. Juk, are you all right? - Why are you mumbling? - Idea. Are saying mantras? Shut up. I'm concentrating. Idea. Who is talking? It's crowded in front of your house. Police, reporters, citizens, and the food hawkers too. Go see it for yourself. Did you see any strange signs from your son before the incident? THE SUSPECT'S PARENTS So, here's the thing. The thing is, my son was born weird. I'm worried if there are any normal signs in him. But yesterday he was still weird. Right, honey? Right, honey. Really. We didn't see that coming. - Honey. - Really unexpected, right, honey? Honey, enough. Stop crying. Your mouth becomes wider. Enough. - I'm sad. - Enough. Enough. I am Jeremy Teti. Reporting from the suspect's house. This is not right. Poor Daddy and Mommy. I have to turn myself in and explain everything. No, Juk. Seriously. This is all my fault. - Let me turn myself in. - Hey! Nobody turns themselves in. Just watch out all of you. Come on, everyone. Follow me. I have something to show. - Turn on the light, Jul. - Okay, Daddy. Oh, my God. You didn't say you have toys like this. Seriously? Fostov 3KV production in 1965. A slight modification on the module. Primary engine thrust 27,83 kilonewton? Delta-v 300 meter per second? Already with the drum control system. This girl is very smart. Where did you get all this, Professor? The glories of the past. The glories of the past. There was a time where our country could compete with other superpowers. Cool. Juki, don't bother him. He is on a flashback. - Yes. - Finished? - I will continue the story first. - Yes. So, the mission in the past was to become the first Asian country to be able to send humans into space. We also competed at that time. When everyone was busy advancing the future, people outside were busy fighting. Viewers, Indonesia is in a state of emergency. All government programs were stopped. Finally, the mission was canceled. The program totally stopped. Does this still work, Professor? It sure does. If there is fuel. This engine doesn't have fuel? Then it's useless, Uncle. Used to be useless. Now so anymore. Because now there is you. Here. If my calculations are correct, your superpower is... higher than my calculations. I love you, stinky beans! That's all my powers, Uncle? No laser gaze, firing fireballs, flight, or something? Yes. Flying is okay. Fireball? I don't know about that. Let me think about it again. The most crucial thing is you eat the stinky beans as much as possible. From now on, we work. Welcome aboard, Mr. Anto. SUCCESS Hey! Eat the stinky bean again. Professor, who will be the pilot? There is only one person who can fly this thing. We also still need to plan how to make the cut on the asteroid? Here is the person. Who's that, Professor? He was the greatest pilot in Indonesia. But his career fell because he was crazy for action. Meanwhile, I'm crazy to think. It's not harming the people. But he... Hey, drive properly! Last time we met, the situation rather uncomfortable. It's going to be tough. Gap. Gap. Togap! You're Togap, right? Wait, let me check. Yes, it's true. CLASSIFIED How are you, Gap? It's me. Juned. Do you remember? Gap, do you want to be an astronaut? Did you see the news about the asteroid falling here? Not afraid of getting crushed by it? It's huge. AN ASTEROID EN ROUTE TO EARTH If it really falls, everything will be gone, Gap. So, if your bus isn't asteroid-proof, it's useless to fix it. Asteroid-proof bus. I'll write it down first. Mr. Togap, I'm Erin from the Space Agency. What Prof. Juned said is true. We are looking for a space shuttle pilot to stop the asteroid from crashing here. You. Do you have a space shuttle? Magic Bemo, Gap. You remember it, don't you? I restructured myself, Gap, until it's finished, Gap. - How about it? - What? You want to embarrass me again? I haven't gone home in 50 years because of you. My parents didn't see me become an astronaut. In fact, I'd told everyone in the village about it. Damn. This mission is our only chance for survival. And the second chance for Mr. Togap to become an astronaut. If we succeed, it's not only Mr. Togap's hometown, all of Indonesia will speak about Togap, the Astronaut. When do we leave? According to my notes, it's best before the asteroid gets here, Gap. Until when will I bear the burden? I can't help holding back I'll chase... Gosh. I forgot you were there. Okay, Yung. Bring it down. I'm leaving. Four more items ordered today. Okay. Go on, then. My jack is broken. Good thing he is here. His name is Buyung. The face of a movie star with the fortune of a digger. JKING - THE KING OF STINKY BEANS POLICE STATION Well? There are no signs yet? Yes, sir! What signs, sir? - The signs of the fugitive. Idiot! - Yes, sir. No sign of the idiot fugitive, sir. The cars that passed here only bring the stinky beans. - Stinky bean? Okay, then. - Yes, sir. WANTED WANTED, FUGITIVE Stinky bean. Where are you going, Juk? I'm finding other food. I can't stand it anymore. I have eaten various types of stinky bean. I can get uric acid disease. I also want to see Daddy and Mommy. What if someone sees you? We'll see. You little thief. How dare you? Don't run away! Mommy! Yes. Go call your Mommy. She won't help you. I'll turn you into stinky beans pepes! Damn thief. Mommy, it's Juki. Geez. Why are you yelling? Honey, Juki's home. Where is he? You brat. I fed and paid for his education, now he's a terrorist. Hear me first, Daddy. Don't, honey. No. Don't defend him. Because of him, the world will end. Listen to him first, honey. Why are you defending him? I'll pull your hair. Calm down, honey. Juki, speak up. Mommy, Daddy. Don't trust things on TV. Just trust me. You said it yourself, Daddy. Men must be trustworthy in their words. Juk, danger. Security forces. Excuse me? - There are so many, Juk. - This is bad. - What should we do? - What are you doing, Juk? Everyone, raise your hands! You are surrounded! Get down! Get him! - Hello? - Arrest him! My son. Honey, Juki. Come on, clean it up. Hello, brother? Mommy! WARDEN Mommy! He is afraid of me. Gosh. The candy wrap cries. - Hurry! - Hush! You don't want people to be happy. You're noisy, fried rice wrap. Come on! Roach. How did you get in here? Juk. Quick. Open the door. Okay. It's hard. It's open. Let's get out. Run away. Come. Hurry up! How do we escape, Cong? Damn. MY plan only reached this point, Juk. That's him. Get him! Relax, Juk. Let me face them. Are you sure, Cong? Relax, Juk. I'm not the old Congky anymore. Where are you going? Come here. Don't run away! - Juki! - Daddy! - Come on. - Okay, Daddy. Where are we going, Daddy? Relax. Just hide yourself. Your mom has an old school friend in East Timor. Her name is Siti Dinamit. What if we evacuate there? But I can't come with you, Dad. What's wrong now? I must help Uncle destroy the asteroid that will crash into here. That's him! After him! - Destroying the asteroid? - Right. You hit your head or something? Or did you have an illegal business in jail, so you got crazy? No, Dad. Now I know why Uncle is always locked all this time. Turns out he made a rocket, Dad. The latest rocket. Juned makes rocket? Think before you talk. Maybe it's a firecracker. You don't believe me, Dad? If I don't believe you, why am I helping you out? I'm sure Mommy told you to. You're right. Your mother told me to. Look out, Dad! I'm sorry, Juk. I'm not fast enough. It's okay, Dad. Thanks for picking me up. Hey, boarding boy. Have you all showered? JUKI'S DEFENDERS FRONT Who are they? Make a shield. You're crazy, Za. Run quickly, Juk. We'll handle them. But, Za... - Let's go, Dad! - You go. - Take the tuk-tuk to Juned's place. - Thanks, Dad. Relax. I'll take care of everything. Hopefully I don't hit the power pole in front. How is it, Professor? Is it enough for the flight? We need some more. I'm afraid there won't be enough to return. We still really need Juki. Trust me. Calm down. If it's only that, leave it to me and Buyung. - It's easy. Let's go, Yung. - Yes, sir. Professor, if they fail and get caught, all of our efforts will be in vain. Hello! What are you guys doing? - Did you run away? - No. Apparently, I still have many fans. It's good that we all gathered here. Captain of the final day committee. Are you coming? Sure is. PENGGARIS TERRORIST MOVEMENTS DETERRENCE - All standby! - Yes, sir! Okay. We begin now. God speed. Ten, nine... Eight, seven... - Six... - Five... Four... Fifty-four, fifty-seven, sixty-two... Juki! Brother Juki! Sorry. I'm too excited. What are we counting for? Mother Goose, do we need to repeat the countdown? Over. Well, we don't have to. I also forgot what the count was. I'll just press it, okay? What rocket is that? It works! It works! My junk is great. Magic Bemo, go! - Go! - Put your hands up! All right. My hands are already up. Roach, you're coming too. Where have you been? What? My safety belt is off. But why am I not floating? Should I hold my breath? Our village is very beautiful. Where? Oh, no. Magic Bemo to Mother Goose. Over. Magic Bemo to Mother Goose. Over. Magic Bemo to Mother Goose. Over. Prof. Juned? Mr. Anto? Hello? Hello? No. DANGER It seems like we'll pass a small asteroid shower. Relax. It's a piece of cake. I'm here, am I not? Now, check it out. Oh, no! Hang on! Look at your faces. There's no point in making me the pilot if I can't handle this kind of stress. Oh, my God! Bad news, guys. Our fuel is leaking. The air pressure is dropping. Gosh. Our explosion tubes are also out. Airlock station 3 and aircraft 4, stat. Oh, my God! Since when did you become a member of KETIR? - What is KETIR? - Here! Radical Terrorist Group. KETIR. - Let me write it down. - And don't lie! Speak the truth. Or we will use the fast way! - The hard way, sir. - What did I say? - "The fast way." - Really? Come on, confess. Who paid you? This is the right moment, sir. About the payment, right? I've worked 40 years in this Space Agency, sir. SALARY SLIP But for the past two months, it hasn't melted yet, sir. - What is "melting"? - It means, "not paid yet". - That is not right. - Don't play with me! Back to your seat! I don't like to be permanent like this. Played with. Whatever you say, Officer. I told you, the calculation of Garuda Jaya was wrong. I might be lying. But this note will never lie. For your information. We change it with the correct calculation, yesterday. If what you're doing is right, why did the shuttle crash? Obviously, you guys have been saboteur it. - What? - "Sabotaged", sir. It seems we have to use a more primitive way. "Effective", sir. Effective. Come on. Confess! The act of sabotaging, terrorism, protecting the country's fugitives, and launching missiles without official letters. These are all major crimes against the country, Prof. Juned. What I launched wasn't a missile, sir. But a space shuttle to destroy the asteroid, sir. Well, look. Now, there are five people, including Juki, orbiting above. Looking for the asteroid that will destroy us all. If I don't return to the control room stat, none of us in this room will survive, sir. And unfortunately, the mission was a waste, sir. Please, write it down. A waste. Gosh. Why is it written "mujaer"? Didn't he just say "waste"? What do you want, anyway? Magic Bemo, this is Mother Goose. Over. This is Magic Bemo. Come in, Mother Goose. Where have you been, Dad? Wait a minute. Just relax. I'll tell you later. What should we do, Professor? Gosh. Now, you just land. Tell Juki to finish the remaining stinky beans until none of it is left, okay? I'll be back soon. Mother Goose out. JUKI C.S. POSITION EARTH Is there another way, Professor? Yes, sir? Wait a minute, sir. I'm sharpening my pencil. Gosh. What should I do? If it's like this, it will be like that. If so, like this. Magic Bemo to Mother Goose. The tube's filled. - Over. - How much did you get? Less than half, Professor. Gosh. That's still not enough. Actually, there's more. Juki, take it all out, okay? You will need as much as possible. Okay. What are you doing? What hole? He is getting crazy. Erin, why is he like this? No. He needs motivation to be sad. Quickly. Everyone, help him. Come on. Run over kittens. Members of H.R. The Chairman of the H.R. Top up, but wrong number. What else? - Erin, help. - Seriously. I'm thinking. Pluto was excluded from the solar planetary classification because it was too small. Sad, isn't it? It was my favorite planet. Got a lot, Juki? Not bad, Professor. More than a half. Okay. You only need to plant it, okay? - How was that? - Okay, Professor. I get it. The remaining J-Power is planted with Jule's phone. Good. The signal will be seen from here. When we enter the Earth's atmosphere, we will use it to guide... The missiles that we'll launch from here. And destroy the asteroid. Once you enter the atmosphere, do not forget... Wait a minute. - I'm the one who forgot. - The rescue capsule. The Foztop 3KV is equipped with a rescue capsule. That's what I meant. Jule knows how to use it. Good. Well, once you enter Earth, eject it. Okay? - Yes, Mother Goose. - Okay, everybody. Calm down. Let me perform this noble task alone. Yung, accompany me. How can I dig alone? You said you wanted to perform this noble task alone. Now you're asking for help. - Let's go. - Thank you. INDONESIA BOMBARDED BY ASTEROIDS Viewers, we have not yet received further information regarding the condition and fate of Magic Bemo's rocket crew which was launched without permission a few days ago. We can only hope that they will succeed in this mission. Juk, hurry up! Sand storm. The sand can enter your eyes, Juk. Gosh. We're wearing helmets, Yung. Everything is safe. I almost died. Indeed, I couldn't dodge it. Juk, what are you doing there? Looking for agate for Daddy. - Yes. I think it's here. - Look! Everyone is waiting. - Come on, hurry up. - Okay. Come on! Juki to The Magic Bemo. Over. Juki to Magic Bemo. Over. We can't see the shuttle. We're going in the wrong direction. Juki! Yung! Where is Buyung. Come in, Buyung. I can't leave Buyung here. Buyung, where are you? Buyung! Buyung! JUKI C.S. POSITION EARTH - Where is Juki? - We got separated. - I don't know where he is. - Never mind. Quickly, go up. Juki? Come in, Juki. Juki. Juki! Juki! That's Erin. Erin! Erin! Juki! Erin! Come on, Juk. I can't reach you. Try again, Juk. I can't. You sure can. You can reach me if you stand up. That's right. Okay, then. I'll drive. Okay. Hold on, Rin. What happened now? Jule? Brother Togap? Jule, come in. I just realized. Your eyes... That's right. It's like this from the factory. My dad brought me to a doctor once. He said that it can be fixed. But it didn't happen. Because Daddy said I was created this way for a reason. So I can see everything from a wider perspective. So, don't be mad if someone makes fun of you. That's what he said. Come to think of it, Daddy just didn't want to pay for it. It's true actually. It feels safer if we're the same as other people. It takes more courage to be different. Come on, quick. What's wrong with you two? In ten minutes we enter the Earth's atmosphere. JUKI C.S. POSITION EARTH Magic Bemo, come in. The signal has been received. Eject now. EJECTOR The ejector doesn't work. Really? Come, let me try. There's a broken cable. I'll try to fix it. Here. Let me do it, Jul. Too far, Brother. Target locked. Awaiting orders. DANGEROUS ZONE Why haven't they ejected yet? Magic Bemo, this is Mother Goose. Over. Daddy, the ejector is stuck. Sir, the asteroid is approaching the safe limit. - We have to shoot it now. - Forgive me, sir. Wait a little longer. Let the capsule eject first. You may read a book while waiting. Wait a minute, sir. - I'm sorry, Professor. - Sir? Mr. President? Now, the choice is all of Indonesia or them? Here is a pencil, sir. You can use it to write. Please, sir. Mr. President? I'm sorry, Prof. Juned. Don't, sir. Just a minute, sir. I beg you, sir. Awaiting orders, sir. Wait a minute, sir. - Launch the missile! - Yes, sir! No! Roach, what are you doing? Come here! No! This is not fair. Viewers, there's a foreign object stuck at the top of the National Monument. - That's Juki. - That's right. Hello! Have you guys taken a shower? Why are you hanging there? Making vows? Thank God! That's the story when my friends and I destroyed the asteroid. No one knows what happened to Ganjar Ginanjar after he escaped. Some say, the plane crashed. But it has not been found until now. Calm down, sir. I've read that it's more likely that humans die from mosquitoes than being eaten by sharks, sir. CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS & SUCCESS Meanwhile, the roach will always be remembered. Not only by me, but by all Indonesian people. ROACH NATIONAL HERO Good job, roach! Good job!
