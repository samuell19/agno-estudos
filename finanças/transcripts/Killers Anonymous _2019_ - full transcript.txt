This better be an emergency. Uh-huh. Yeah, of course I'm still coming. I'm still in group, obviously. Which is why I'm on the other end of the phone talking to you. At group. I'm hanging up now. Okay. Let's call it a night there, team. Great work, everyone, really. Really terrific. And Lucy, remember what we said about the stalking, yeah? Now, I'm away for a few days now in London, but remember, next week is my final meeting, so be sure to get yourselves down here 'cause I might even bring some cake, yeah? Great. Great work. Crowds gathered in central London today to get a glimpse of the popular US senator John Kyle, who is heavily tipped to become the next President of the United States of Americ. In a statement issued by... Jesus. What happened? You scared me. - It wasn't my fault. - What wasn't? What happened. Which was? Look, I know how you can get, and I'm just telling you up front. Oh, you know how I get? Two more, please. It wasn't my fault, is all I'm saying. Look, I've been working for you for a while, mister, and... - I just want you to know that I tried. - I know. I really, really, really tried. What happened? - Jade. - What? Why is the senator on TV? - You ever have one of those days? - I'm having one right now. Was the schedule wrong? No, no. The schedule's perfect. Then what happened? It's actually kind of a funny story. You'll laugh when I tell you. Then tell me. You ever heard of Sunset Boingo? No. I used to moonlight there. I started off as a bartender. A friend of mine, good guy, solid man, he let me sleep on his couch and I was doing the whole freeloader thing, 'cause my girlfriend, she broke up with me. I forget why. Something about, like, "You're not listening," or something... Jade. - I was in a rush. - Tell me what happened. I'm trying to tell you. So anyway, I was in a rut and I'm doing the bartender thing and then they asked me if I wanted to be a bouncer. And at first, I was like, "Bouncer?" I thought that was like a demotion or something until I found out that bouncers make $5,000, sometimes $6,000 in a weekend. And I was like, "Yo, sign me up. Bouncer." Around this time, I'm also... I started fucking this waitress. My first night out, I'm with this other dude Myles, and-and Myles was this big guy, huge. He could bench-press, like, five of me. As we started talking, it became pretty clear that the waitress that I was fucking was the same waitress he was fucking. And he was definitely pretty serious about that, so, um... the joking didn't last very long and neither did the fight. So you got your ass kicked by a bouncer at a club called Sunset Boingo. - Maybe. - And why should I care? Because Myles doesn't work for Sunset Boingo anymore. In fact, Myles doesn't even work in the States anymore. W. Yeah. Yeah, he's now working at W. Here in London. Yeah. And he was there today? - Oh, yeah. - And he recognized you. Actually... not at first. What do you mean, not at first? Well, I mean, I was waiting in line and I was about to get in and then I see Myles from Sunset Boingo and I was like, "Yo!" So you said something. I mean, I didn't think that he would hold a grudge after all these years. And he kicked you out. You know what the really shitty part is? I made a good-faith gesture, a show of friendship. - Bygones being bygones. - Hold on. Hold on. Three years ago, you pissed off a bouncer by sleeping with his girlfriend. Tonight, you ran into that same bouncer who didn't recognize you at first, but then you made a show of friendship, after which he kicked you out of the place you were supposed to set up the shot. I can't ask you any more questions tonight, Jade. Not just because the clock is ticking, but I hate being in the field and I hate asking questions, 'cause it means I don't have the answers, and when I don't have the answers, it usually means I'm gonna be away from the comfort of my armchair even longer. So with all due respect, and I appreciate you being a lady, does that just about summarize every fucking thing that happened? Uh... It's the really short version, but yeah. I'm waiting for you to get to the part where it isn't your fault. There's a lot riding on this tonight, Jade. I know. A lot of interested parties. Many vested interests. You... You understand what I'm saying? I know. You're upset. No, I'm not upset. No. People much more important than me get to be upset. Another one for the lady. You know, I'll have whatever she's having. Fuck off. Okay. Have a great night. You know, you're not as bad as they say. Take some free advice. Clean up that lip. Sleep it off. But don't hang around here. It'll only make things worse. Okay. Bye, Jade. Do you like what I did with the place? - That's very chic. - Thank you. No worries. Here you go. One for me. Really... - Cheers. - Cheers. Ah. Why don't you serenade me? I intend to. You're so pretty. I'll be right back. Don't take too long. We were powerless over killing. Our lives had become unmanageable. We came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. We made a decision to give our will over to the care of Killers Anonymous. We made a searching and fearless inventory of ourselves, admitted to ourselves and to other human beings the exact nature of our wrongs. ♪ I don't know what it is That makes me love you so ♪ ♪ I only know I never wanna let you go ♪ ♪ 'Cause you started something Oh, can't you see? ♪ ♪ Ever since we met You've had a hold on me ♪ ♪ It happened to be true ♪ ♪ I only want to be with you ♪ Is that your girlfriend? No, it's my work, honey. Oh, no, it's okay. I get it. I get it. In my line of work, I can't leave loose ends. - I gotta go. - I get it. - No, seriously. - No, stay! What the fuck! You know, you really should have listened to your handler. What'd you say? You heard me. You really should have gone home. That looks good. He told you... nothing good was going to happen to you then. You were pardoned, but you were too fucking stupid to see it. You made a real fucking mess here, Jade. You didn't respect the job. 'Cause if you had, you'd have known it's not just a job, and you never would have accepted. An assassination attempt has taken place on the American senator John Kyle. The severity of his injuries are currently unknown. Yeah. I mean, he was dead before he even woke up today, and it was never gonna be because of you, because it is not just a job. It is an art. Hello, yes. Police. Hello? May I help you? No. Uh... Well, maybe. Um... I was told to say "Pisces." Please. Hello, boys. Come on in. They don't bite. Oh, yes, Calvin, if you would get a chair for the lady, that would be lovely. Please. Just come in. Just make yourself at home. First time, then? Oh, yeah. Well, I'm Jo. Leandro. Uh, I'm Calvin. And you are? I'm... Oh, it's all right. Just come and sit down. No rush. We're just waiting for a few others and then we'll get started. - Hey. - Hey. Holy shit. Hey. Hi. Sorry. What's your name? She's not shared yet. - Oh, right. Well, I'm Ben and this is Leandro. - We already did that. Right. Um, so, we're just waiting on... Naturally. Would it kill them to be on time for once? So, yeah, whoever you are, nice to have you with us. - I'm Ben. - You've already said that. Right. Yeah. Anyway... So... everyone see the news? Hard not to. It's like Lord of the Flies out there. Um, how is it like Lord of the Flies, Ben? Hmm? I said, how is it like Lord of the Flies? Like, police everywhere. I know that's what you meant. I was just wondering... I don't understand how that's like an island of children savagely murdering each other. Is... I thought that was... Was that not Animal Farm? You're a fucking idiot. Leo, please, come on. These meetings are a place of sharing and of positivity, safety. The meeting ain't started yet. Oh, yeah. Help yourself. Anyway, the senator. - You guys see how they got him? - Like a sniper shot. Yeah. It was a nice shot, too. Got something you want to share with us, Ben? Well, no. It was a nice shot. You can share if you want to, you know. We all slip up sometimes. No, it was a nice shot. That's all I'm saying. Oh, you okay? - Yeah. - Don't worry about that. Actually... Actually, no. Um... I shouldn't have come here. I'm so sorry. This was a mistake. Krystal? Krystal. Who the fuck are you? I was just... I was just leaving. Oh, were you? That's interesting, 'cause no one just fucking leaves. Let her go, Krys. Oh, what a surprise. Ben's probably gonna try and fuck you, you know. But I wouldn't read into it too much, 'cause you know what? I had to fend him off with a knife for my first two weeks, didn't I, Ben? You know, I should... Not in a rapey way. I mean, more in, like, a puppy dog kind of way, and I fucking hate puppy dogs. - Pisces. - Hmm? Pisces. Say that again? Uh-huh. Pisces. Maybe you're right where you should be. So why don't you stick around... and tell us why? Hmm? That's what I thought. Okay, right. I think we should just get started. We're not waiting on Markus and Jade? No, they'll catch up when they get here. Uh, Krystal, could you come and take a seat, please? I have a question. Oh? Okay, Calvin, you go ahead. Who called this meeting? Ah, well, you know how it works. Not exactly. But tonight of all nights, the city the way it is... If you're that worried, why are you here? Go home, boss. I just require clarity. Of course, Calvin. It's a very valid question, but why don't we just table that for now? Er, and... is everybody ready? Mmm. Sorry. It's not quite sweet enough. Mmm. - Much better. - Fucking real? All good now? Mmm-hmm. Welcome to KA. My name is Jo. Hi, Jo. We're all here because we're not all there. KA is an education without a graduation. It's a place of listening and respect. We all have another fumble in us... but we don't know if we have another recovery. We were powerless over killing. We were powerless over killing. Our lives had become unmanageable. We came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. We made a decision to turn our will over to the care of KA. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves, admitted to ourselves and to other human beings the exact nature of our wrongs. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of KA, we try to carry this message to other killers, and to practice these principls in all our affairs. Fabulous. Okay, who would like to go first? I will. Ben, the room is yours. - Thanks. Hi, everyone. My name is Ben. - Hello, Ben. And it has been 284 days since my last kill. Ben, please continue. So, there was never any real doubt what I'd be doing after school, I guess. - 'Sup. - Who the fuck says that shit? "'Sup." 'Sup, fucker. Fucking do that again, I'll smack you hard, man. Promise ya. Markus, we've talked about this. Well, I'm terribly sorry about that. Maybe you should try locking your door. Martial law going on up there. Hello, Doctor. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Ben. Please continue. Yeah, Benny boy. By all means, do continue. - You done? - Yeah. So, I mean, I was a killer even before I got to boot camp. I served three tours, all in the desert, and I saw and I did a lot of things that I'll never forget. Some things I'm not proud of, maybe even most of them. My first kill wasn't there. My first kill was out in the woods behind my best friend's house. I'd smelt gunpowder 100 times before, but it seemed so much stronger that day. Poured up into my nose, into my brain, stayed with me for days. For weeks, I had flashbacks, like a... almost like a dream you keep coming back to. Fuck off. A hunting accident. You lost your cherry on a fucking hunting accident. Jesus Christ. Who is this guy? Markus. Fuck off. I'll break your fucking jaw, you little weaselly bastard. Markus, if you can't contribute in a more constructive way, then you're going to be banned from the meetings. Don't try to tell me you don't know what's going down up in those fucking streets. You've got the city's best and brightest professionals all down here in this fucking dodgy basement with... Who the fuck are you, for a start? A whole city didn't take down that senator. Come on. - I smell fucking shite in here. - Okay. All right. Ben, please. Carry on. - Well, it wasn't an accident. - Prick. I'd never had a person there, a human, at the other end of my scope before. I mean, he was my best friend, for Christ's sake. I knew it was wrong. It was the wrongest thing I'd ever done. But it didn't feel wrong. What did it feel like? Like waking up. Why did you do it? I couldn't tell you. - What did you do with the body? - I buried it. Not because I was worried about getting caught. Honestly, I waited for weeks for the police to show up, but no one ever came. I even thought about what it would be like to go to prison. Oh, my God. They would fucking love you in prison, wouldn't they? Anyway, so I even got excited about the idea of killing again. I wanted to share. Then why bury him? Sounds s-stupid. It's okay. I wanted to thank him. For fuck's sake. Ben, come on. Seriously, what is she even doing here? Come on, the kid's a fucking pussy. Krystal, please engage. Anyway, after that, I enlisted. I lived for that kill shot. Problem is, you do that long enough, you forget how to live for anything else. They made me very good at one thing. When the tour came to an end, they told me to go home, put it away. So I got this fucking itch. It's with me every day. Some days I don't scratch it and some days... some days, I do. Okay. All right, guys. Thank you, Ben, for sharing. Thank you, Ben. That was... Yes, Markus? Who the fuck is she? Well, I suggest we take ten minutes and collect our thoughts and hopefully we'll find out when we come back. Would anybody like some coffee? I'm going for a cig. I can't wait to hear her story. Yeah, that'll be interesting. You having one? Sure. - Character, isn't she? - Who? Krystal. I saw you looking at her in there. Can't figure out what you were thinking. Kinda looked like she amused ya. She just reminds me of someone I know. Yeah? You don't strike me as the kind to get close to people who are batshit crazy. I'm here, aren't I? My point. So what do you think about everyone else? I don't really know what to think. We're all batshit crazy. You should've left when you had the chance. Thought definitely crossed my mind. Two failed attempts to take out that fucking senator in one night. It's a fucking embarrassment. Well, what the hell happened? Shouldn't I be the one asking you that? Let me call you back. Don't even think about hanging up on me, Jo. Jo. Jo. Don't you fucking... Any minute now. Excuse me? The rain, I can feel it. It's close. Yeah. You'll feel better if you share, you know. Share what? In the meeting. Share your story. Might not fix it, but it'll help. Like when you do a cry and you finally let it out. Please don't tell anybody I said that. Your secret's safe here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful. Careful. Careful. Thanks. Yeah. The way you're holding on to that rail, I'd think you were afraid of heights. I'm terrified. I really am. Look, I'm sorry. This is just... This has just been a really crazy night for me. It's a crazy night for everyone. It's not every day a candidate for president gets assassinated, is it? Here we go. I guess it's not a good night to be a bad guy, then. Do let me know when there is a great night to be a bad guy, please. If you share, you'll feel better. Trust me. Yep, any minute now. Hmm. Okay. It's just a rat. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Geez. There. Okay. Okay. So I think that's everyone here again. Um, Ben, thank you very much. Right, then, who would like to go next? My name is Calvin and I am a killer. Hello, Calvin. Many years ago, when I was a young man, my wife and I were involved in a car accident. I was trapped in the seat beside her. I had to watch her die. It was... beautiful. To date, I have lost 34 patients, not to illness or trauma, but for the simple reason that I wanted to watch them die. I do not walk around killing people. I do not get paid to do it. I am a doctor. I have an oath that I'm sworn to uphold. "Do no harm." Sometimes you have to do harm in order to do good. Sometimes you have to cut off a limb in order to save the body. So that we might witness the transition. Transition? The transition to the inert. The reminder that we are all elemental. The stuff of supernovas. And there is something that cannot be found in a periodic table. Something that makes us different from the other 99.999 percent of the universe. Something that makes us... alive. What I do, what I allow to happen, is my way of conquering that fear. Thank you, Calvin. Thank you, Calvin. Okay. Next, I would like to try something, if no one objects. Um, an exercise. Perhaps something that might help us deal with the everyday stresses we all face. I'd like to hear about... the last time... you thought about killing someone. Right, I'll go. I'm Leo and I'm a killer. Hello, Leo. It was this morning, the shop down the road from me. I've got a soy milk maker. - So once a week, I go and restock. - A what? A soy milk maker. I make me own soy milk. Why? Because it's a healthier alternative to lactose and it's easier and quicker to make than you might think. Okay. Soy milk. Gotcha. Anyway... so I go to restock on the beans. I go in down the first aisle, next to the artisanal breads, and there's this old lady there with these gaudy fucking rings on, ten coats of makeup and this bushy unibrow, taking up the last of them fucking beans. I want to strangle her from behind, garrote her with me shoelace, but I thought, "No, that ain't right." I want to watch the life drain out of her eyes... put me hands around her chubby neck, squeeze her and see her puff and sweat that mascara right out of her fat fucking face. Or stab her in her armpit. A lot of people don't know there's a nerve cluster there. And then I'll just watch her piss herself right there in the bakery section. All because of soybeans. Stupid shit, really. Everybody thinks it sometimes. Just out on the motorway or standing in the queue at the supermarket. The only difference is that I could've done it. I have done it. I wanted to do it, but I didn't. It took everything I had, but I didn't do it. Leo... Leo, it's important to know our triggers. What was your first kill? What? Your first kill. I can't remember. - Come on. - I don't know. We all have a first one, though. I'll tell you the first one I felt. Lady Ming. Are you kidding? You killed Ming? Oh, you kept that quiet, didn't you, you sneaky son of a bitch? I fucking knew it. I fucking knew it. Only a professional could've taken down that evil old cow. You know, everyone said it was cancer. I'm actually mildly impressed. The bosses still call me that too, the fucking cancer. Like it's clever. - How did you do it? - Poison. For that to pass as something other than poison, the doses would have to be small. It would have to be done over a period of weeks, months. Seventy-two weeks, four days. - How did you get access? - She was my godmother. What I don't get is how does the head of the triad become godmother to some low-rent enforcer? That wasn't the story. Well, let's make it the story. How the fuck did no one know? 'Cause I was good at me job. I worked years for that family. When you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. I worked every fucking day. I was good at it. I did what I had to do. I just didn't know I'd have to do so much. The job's killing. I'm not under any illusion about that. But what I didn't know until Ming... it's not about killing them. It's about how many times we have to kill ourselves to do it. Or how many times it takes what's best about you and fucking rips it out. And the worst part is, it never really dies. I wish it would. Would make it so much easier. But it just sits there, the best part of you, sick and hurting. And every time you think it's gone... every time you think you can't die inside anymore, you fucking do. And then it feels like the first time all over again. Okay, let's thank Leandro for sharing. Thank you, Leo. Thank you, Leo. Christ. Finally. - Hello, V. - I really need to speak to you. - Are you busy? - No, no, of course I've got time for you. It's happening again. I'm gonna hurt someone. I know I am. You're the reason I moved out to LA. You're the only one who helps me. In a calm manner, nice and controlled. I don't feel in control. Now tell me, what kicked it off? What was your trigger? I was just making a sandwich. I was calmly making a controlled sandwich. V, are you pacing? Picture my face. Sit down. Yeah, fine. Okay. Back to the sandwich. Can I ask you a question? What kind of sandwich were you making? Chicken. Yeah. Yeah. It's classic. It's the bones, innit? - Yeah. - Yeah. I really wish there was more information available, but, unfortunately, the funding... Well, it simply isn't there. As your sponsor, I should have had the foresight to have warned you about the chicken thing. Next time, buy fillets. Violet, I'm going to have to call you back. - Hey. - Hello. I liked what you said. It was a good story. Yeah, I've also been thinking a lot about what you said earlier. They're a fucked-up bunch, but who better to listen to how fucked-up you are than a fucked-up bunch? Speak of the devils. Oh, I'm sorry. - Are we interrupting something here? - Nope. You know that 2.5 million people die of second-hand smoke? Well, fuck off back downstairs then, Ben. Which hospital was it you said you worked at again? The Royal Bridge. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason. Just now I know where to send my mother-in-law. - Krys. - What? You were a drama queen at school, right? Actually, Ben, I was the queen of fucking everything at school. She means she was a slag. Oh, fuck off, Leo. Go fuck yourself. Oh, please! Can't we come together for just one night and put the ego and posturing and one-upmanship aside? You know, listening and respect. "Do unto others" and all that other fucking nonsense. What do you think, Markus? I think all you guys do is talk in fucking monologues and I feel I'm stuck on a rooftop with a bunch a dodgy Bond villains. Guys. Found him. - Who? - Or her. Who? Whoever killed the senator. Yeah, Jo, I think the no-phone rule is about to go bust. We could check on the television downstairs. Oi. Excuse me, pal. Who the fuck are you? - Hey, he just asked you a fucking question. - Yeah, okay. Can we help you? I would hope so, Joanna. - What the fuck? - You know this fucker? - Senator Kyle. - John. No fucking way. No fucking way. Whoa, whoa! I don't mean to be out of order here, but why are you here and not fucking dead? Ask her. You know him? You mind us asking how? The guy was supposed to miss, right? That was the plan. So what the fuck happened? I'm kinda thinking that too. - What the fuck's going on? - He just asked you a fucking question. - You changed the deal. - No, no, no, nothing changed. - So why was I shot tonight? - I don't know. So you were hit? - You what? - I don't know. You lying piece of shit. - I don't know! Christ! - Everybody calm down. Senator, what happened? The area is secured, sir. That's the second time I've heard that today. So excuse me if I have zero confidence in you fucking morons. - Wait outside. - Sir. I prefer to bleed in private. Get out! For a moment, I thought it was just a misfir. Think of the new voters I'd get surviving this. ...just released by the American Embassy confirms that Senator John Kyle was killed in this morning's attack. But that was just a moment. The real mistake was that I was still alive. That way. Did the bullet go all the way through? - Get away from me. - Well, I can take a look. - Ben, what the fuck are you doing? - I'm helping. Why? - What do you mean why? - You're not a fucking doctor. - I thought maybe... - Just get off. Oh! Calvin. You are. Fix the man. - No. I'm fine. - Yes, of course. Then it doesn't hurt for him to look. You need stitches. A needle and thread. There's a first-aid kit upstairs. I'll go. That's deep. Should we even be doing this? Doing what? The guy's supposed to be dead. But he is not. He is here and he is wounded. He should be there and dead. So they're gonna be looking for him. They don't need to look because they are the CIA and they weren't supposed to hit me at all. But I guess someone didn't get that memo tonight. The CIA? This is some dark shit. I promise you, John, nothing changed. - The plan was still the plan. - Not for everyone. - Well, I had no idea. - Really? The breaking news report that Senator John Kyle of California had been assassinated wasn't a clue that maybe something tonight had gone upside down? Really sorry. Can you go back to the bit about the CIA, please? - What? - Well, you said CIA, as in the Central Intelligence Agency? - Yes. - John. As in the Central fucking Intelligence Agency. Why, you don't know? - Know what? - John. Who do you think runs these meetings? So CIA runs KA? John. Who did you think ran this? Jo. Same thing. You're CIA. Thanks a lot, John. What I wanna know is why you even called this meeting tonight. Thank you. Did I not fucking tell you? - Did I not fucking tell you? - Markus, why don't you shut the fuck up? Fuck off. Oh, fucking brilliant. Okay. Okay. Everyone calm down. Let's get some light. Come on, boys and girls. Gather round. Everybody must listen to Jo. Hmm. Do I work for the CIA? Yes, I do. And so do all of you. Sorry. How's that? Hmm. 284 days ago, Sergei Rokmenonov was skipping across Red Square on his way to work. The Ministry of Justice. Never made it to work that morning because 650 yards from the Ministry building, he was shot and killed. You know how I know it was 650 yards? Because that's the optimum range for an SV-9 sniper rifle. Isn't that right, Ben? See, I'm not just a pretty face. And then two days later, a secure payment was made to a bank account. And the only two people who know the exact amount of that payment are the owner of the bank account and the person that authorized the transfer. So, Ben, if I were to say that £150,000 turned up in your bank account two days after Rokmenonov was killed in Moscow... would you say that was just a fantastic guess or would I know something? Well, that wasn't the CIA. Ah, Ben. It wasn't. It was Steven Sim... Yes, Steven Sims from the Alistair Holdings Group, yes. But who do you think Mr. Sims and AHG work for? God, the cute ones are always so thick, aren't they, Calvin? And two years ago, a patient was rushed to the Royal Bridge, complaining of chest pains and blurry vision. And you were the only resident on call that night, so of course you found the swollen aorta, but you didn't do anything about it. You just waited and watched, as we knew you would. And it was... beautiful. And eight hours later, the patient was dead. Now he happened to be the head of the Armenian Rite who was threatening to expose certain agency contracts in exchange for immunity from the Ministry of Justice, so you really helped us out on that one, Calvin. And then, 11 months ago, Michelle Huang Ming died of cancer... after having been poisoned, but before she was able to sell certain classified information to the Ministry of State Security in China. Ming was a double agent. Leandro, I know this broke your heart... but you helped us clean house. And £200,000. Not bad. And then, only last week, our own Marky Marky Markus over here, he put a bullet in the eyeball of Officer Harold Morano, who was here holidaying with his wife. Officer Morano was about to give a deposition at a trial that would eventually have linked the new Medellin Cartel to certain agency operatives. Yeah, you thought the hit came from your brother. He thought it came from Tyson Mulbury. And Marbury thought it came from... You get the idea. £18,000. Love how cheap you street boys are. Fuck you. Fuck you, too. What about Krystal? Mmm? Krystal? I don't have to tell Krystal who Krystal works for, because Krystal has known all along who Krystal works for. Just as I have known all along, thanks to these meetings. How to get each and every one of you to do exactly what needed to be done. Everyone, that is... except you. This was the biggest operation that we'd planned for eight months. We'd practiced, we'd rehearsed, and still something went wrong. Someone gave you a where and a when and told you to say the word "Pisces." And so, here you are, and you're the only one I haven't met. So, as you can imagine, I'm really looking forward to hearing your story. Christ. - Hello, V. - Stop cutting me off. I'm starting to get a picture here. Has this girl... Has this girl done anything to upset you or have you just taken a disliking to her for another reason? Is there a logical explanation as to why you want to cause her pain? Yes, there's a reason. Did you not just hear anything I just said about her? She's doing it on purpose to make me feel insecure. Yeah. Yeah, we know what's... we know what's going on here, don't we? You're different. You feel alone. Everyone else around you doesn't understand how you find yourself in this position. You feel in danger. The threat levels are high. You're in fight mode to protect yourself. And you feel if this girl wasn't around, that you would feel better about yourself and the fact that she lives next door, you find it very hard to avoid her. I get it. You know, I had exactly the same thing with my wife. Really, you've gotta trust me. I've been there. As I pointed that gun at my wife's face, I said, "Any last words, Heather?" And three hours later, I shot her. Wait. Really? No. No, Violet, love. It was a joke. You get it? "Last words." "Three hours." Talks a lot. I don't find this funny and I'm not in the mood for laughing. I feel like crying. Do you know what? I can't do mixed emotions right now. Yeah. No, I know. All right? I know, darling. I'm so sorry. Violet, you have to think about the long-term consequences. You have to be in control of your destiny. Be fearless. You know what you need to do. I hear you. I know what I have to do. Sorry. I will repent next week, I swear. Oh, Violet. Violet. - Are you in position? - Yes, sir. Good. Don't let him get away this time. Wait for my signal, then... Well, you know what you need to do. That's why none of our phones are working? Ain't you lot got stuff that does that? - We have everything. - Right. So you're jamming the whole city, then? - Probably. - Why? Control the story until they find me. - All done. - It was in the news. Not anymore. If it's already out there at this point, it don't actually matter. - Why are we still here? - I'm sorry? I said, why are we still here? Do you know, Markus is right. Someone's gonna come looking for you. - Probably. - Definitely. And that scares you? Yeah. Yeah, it scares me. It should fucking well scare you too. You're the one they're trying to kill. And I'm sure as fuck I'm not standing next to you when they try again. My grandfather always used to say that a room full of CIA assassins is the safest place to be. Jo, no one gives a fuck about your granddad. Uh, Calvin sits there. Why are you here? How did you know? - That there was a meeting? - Yeah. How do you think? - I don't know. - Because he is CIA too. Jesus. I wanna talk about her. No. No. No. Fuck her. 'Cause right now we're talking about this son of a bitch. Senator John fucking Kyle of California, who, by the way, is the guy most likely to become president of the United fucking States of America. And he just so happens to be CI fucking A. I fucking got that, Krystal. - Trust me, I fucking got that. - Did you? But we're talking about her and we're gonna talk about her. Or I'm gonna lose my fucking shit. It's almost like I don't need to be here. Shut the fuck up, bullshitter. Now... we were gonna talk about you. And we're gonna talk about you. And that'll be... fucking now. Well, my name's Alice... and I have been sitting here listening to all of you. Really, I have. And... I'm sitting here wondering the same thing all of you are wondering, which is, "What am I doing here?" Because I don't want to be a killer. Alice, can you tell us who told you about KA? Yeah, that's what I wanna know, too. I got a text. Okay. From who? I don't know. It was blocked. Jo, don't you send them out? Not exclusively. What does that mean? - It means not exclusively. - But how does it work? Why? Why us? I would just like to point out that you have all been coming here for over a year and this is the first time any one of you has asked this question. - Because you all fit the type. - What type? Your personality profile. Why would she get flagged? Why does someone think you should be here? 'Cause I've killed people. - Duh. Obviously. - Shut up a minute. Remember what we spoke about on the roof. Six months after my mom died, my dad started... I was 13. He just... He just resented me. No, no. He... He hated me, 'cause most days I can still feel the pressure from his boot on my head. He used to make me eat my dinner off of the floor. Those nights were always the worst when he would get me alone, 'cause they just lasted a lot longer. I'm so sorry. I couldn't even protect my sister from him. I went on a school field trip one weekend, and even though we went to the same school, I was older, so her class had to stay behind. And I-I had two full nights away from this... this monster. When I got back, I... I knew she was different, and I... I knew, and all I could think to myself was, "Alice, how could you have left her here?" There were so many things that that man did to me that I should have wanted him dead. But touching her... Touching her was too much. I was pushed. I was... I was pushed. And I didn't even know if I could do it. You know, I wanted to, but I didn't actually think that I could, because I was small and he was... Oh, goddamn, he was so big. But I wasn't shaking. I wasn't scared. It wasn't hard. It was easy. It's just been way too easy on me. I wanted him to fight. I wanted him to make me work for it. Throw me up against a wall. Send pain through me. But I... It was just over way too quickly. And I just remember wanting to do it again. Do you still want it? What? Do you still want to kill? Every single day. I think we all know why you're here. - I don't. - I don't. I fucking don't. Come on. Jo, if anyone needs group, this girl does. Mmm, yes. I agree. And that would be great, if this was group, but this is not group. I've just explained that. There's no fantasy world where murderers meet in a church and exchange their philosophies on killing. This is a place for maintaining contract killers. I thought we were in this place to... So I ask again. What is she doing here? This girl is not a contract killer. - So what is she doing here? - Whoa, whoa. Jo. Jo. Calm down. Uh, what about the no-weapons policy? - This is my insurance policy. - Jo. Jo. I hate to agree with Ben, but think about it. If you think she has something to do with this, then you must do what... Go to hell, John! You're not my boss. Today was a mess, and that's the end of it. Jade messed up and Krystal went in to sort it out, as per our orders. So that's why she ain't here tonight, is it? You horrible bitch. And that's who they found across town, I'm guessing, yeah? She was just doing her job. It's not her fault that Jade fucked up. You wanna blame anyone, you can blame Jade. And as far as I knew, that was it. The mission failed. A new date would be set with a new shooter who would miss as planned. So, John, who actually shot you is anyone's guess. But I still think that she had something to do with it. Bless you. You. Stay right... there. That goes for the rest of you. Well, hello. Don't be scared. Just come on out. - Please. Get away from me. - Come on out. - All right. - Come here, you. Hello. What you doing in there, you little fucking rat? - Fantastic. - The plot thickens. Okay, with all due respect, Krystal... Okay. Talk. No, no, no. We are not doing anything to this little girl. Just do it. - I'm sorry, Senator, do you have children? - That has nothing to do with it. - Down. - Okay, all right, okay. Everybody just stop, stop, stop. Everybody needs to be calm. There's just way, way, way, way too much going on right now. Okay, Alice, move. Move. All those in favor... raise your hands. One, two, three, four. I know what's happening here. If you can assemble this gun by the time Markus gets to the table, then you know what, you get to have it your way. - I don't do this. This is... - You can do it. - Tick-tock. Tick-tock. - Okay, Alice. Come on. Stop shaking. Stop shaking. One more. And then I'm coming for you, darling. Fucking try it, boss. You gonna shoot me? Fuck you. You want some of this? Huh? Come on, then. Get up. Both of you. Sweetheart, are you okay? Okay, I just had to make sure that she was just who she said she was and not a professional killer. Sweetheart, what's your name? Look, it's okay. Morgan. Nice to meet you, Morgan. My name is Alice. Just get to the point. I just need you to be honest with me. Morgan, what are you doing here? I got in a bit of trouble. Okay, so then you hid here. Did you hear anything that happened tonight? I did hear it. I heard all of it. Well, that's it, then. We have no choice. A rat is a problem we don't need. - Okay. Whoa. Wait. Hey, come on. - Joanna, she heard everything. Yeah, exactly. She just heard a bunch of people talking. She didn't see anyone do anything, now did she, okay? So everyone's just gonna come now and sit down and be calm. Come on. Now! Come on! - Shit. - Don't touch her. Hey! Come here. Hey. Okay, okay. The last thing... Okay? The last thing our Morgan here wants to do is upset anyone, right? I mean, you're a smart girl. You know that no one would believe such a crazy story. Look, we are not trusting a kid. She's gonna speak. Maybe not at first, Jo, but one day, she's gonna talk to a friend or she's gonna go to confession and she will speak. I won't. I swear. You'll fucking speak, all right. You shut your little bitch mouth. Markus, she's just a kid, man. I know she's just a kid, but that little bitch is gonna bring all of us down. And I kinda like my life. I got shit to do. Killing her is not the solution. Like Joanna said, the situation is so ridiculous, nobody will ever believe her. All be quiet! - Hey! - Jesus Christ! Morgan, stop it. Shit. - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey! - Don't come any closer. Stay back! Jo, give me the fucking gun. Calm down. Shit! - Fuck. - Sorry, it was an accident. - Krystal! - No. Fuck. Move! Everyone fucking move! Get back inside. Krystal, I need to take a look at Jo. No. I said get back inside now! I need to look at her. I need to look at Jo. - Calvin, shut up. Get inside. - I need to get over there. - No! - Fucking move. No, I need to get over there. Move! Huh. Well, that changes things. Don't you agree? Don't you agree? Alice. Alice, what are you doing, love? Hey. Fucking leave 'em. Think about it. I'm doing what has to be done. You think she's gonna keep quiet after what she just saw? And then we're all supposed to go down for it? No. I've got a family. And I'm not losing them because of somebody else's actions. She's right. Alice, let me do it. You're not made for it. I've been in some fucked-up situations... Okay. Okay, do you know what? Fuck it. Let's make it interesting. Let's see who wants to do it. Markus, you wanna have a go? Yeah, I'm fucking happy to do it. Sure. Put the fucking gun down. Benny boy, why don't you have a fucking go? I told you, I'm not having any part of killing a kid. Noted. Calvin? "Noted"? No, absolutely not. I'm not killing a child. For fuck's sake, Calvin, she's barely a fucking child. She's what, 14? Hey, how old are you? Alice, Alice, what's the crack here, love? How about you let Morgan go, we have a bit of a chat, make some rational decisions? Why don't you just fucking shut up and let her finish? You okay? Let's get back to business. What are you doing, love? This isn't you. You've got no idea who I am, Leo. Who the fuck are you? She... is the new boss. Fuck off. Joanna? Jo, what the fuck? Krystal, I knew that you would understand. Fucking dickhead. Joanna, I demand to know... Fuck! Blanks. Of course. Sorry about the dramatics. You expecting somebody, Joanna? Christ, they found me. Somebody protect me. I can pay. Everything's for sale, right? Oh, God. Hold your breath, John. No one's interested. It's probably cops doing door-to-door. I'll go and take care of it. And then when I'm back, everything will be explained. Everything. It's time. Don't hurt the girls. Okay. They have gone. All right, everybody. First question. Why not just kill me? That's what all of this is about, right? Me? That was my fault. Ah, can't get the shot. Jade was supposed to shoot you and not miss. Excuse me? But she messed up. So I blew the dust off the old Dragunov and stepped in myself. Sorry, John. Nothing personal. Oh. Missed the head. So, what, the company wanted rid of me? Why not just finish me off the moment I walked through those fucking doors? Why all this bullshit? Because not everything is about you, John. You said Dragunov. That's a Russian gun. Well-spotted, Ben. Well, as our wonderful senator said earlier, what was it? "Everything is for sale if the price is high enough, eh?" So, yes, the company is under new management and they just wanted to see which of our members have what it takes to join the new administration. A stress test, if you will. What? Let me introduce Alissa Romanoff and her sister, Morgana Romanoff. Wait, what? Joanna? Oh, yeah, the Russians pay more. Russian? Well, by name. Sisters? Sisters. Motherfuck. See, the problem is, Senator, they started too late with you. A corruptible CIA agent infiltrates the highest level of the political system to become a corruptible senator and a corruptible president surrounded by corruptible yes-men. But if you start young, well, then you're a truer person, incorruptible. You see, the Russian government took us in, gave us both a purpose. So, Senator, please meet your future replacement. This is a joke, right? Does she look like she's joking? It's been a pleasure. Sorry, Calvin. Markus, Krystal, you passed. Come with us. Sorry, lads. See you after, Calvin. Alice. Leandro. Sorry, you're cute, but... not that cute. But I'm gonna give you a chance. Stay here one hour and then you can leave. What, and that's it? Yeah. One hour. Traitor. Do as you're told. - Oh, you bitch. - Mmm-hmm. Right, that's it, then. Hey! Well, it's a trap. Right? Right. One hour, then I can leave. She's lied to you all day. Why should you trust her now? Ah, Leo, I'd really hoped you'd listen. All you had to do was wait one hour. What is it with men not wanting to follow orders? You have to be in control of your destiny, Alice. Be fearless. You know what you need to do. Hey. - Wanna swap? No? - No. No, no, no! You're fucking dead now. I fucking live for this. Excuse me. Need a hand there, mate? My boy Calvin in there. Killers Anonymous, you fucking cock. Go on, Benny boy. - Where do you think you're going? - The heart. Seems as though you've forgotten how this works. Welcome to the fucking club. It's just, Jo, I mean... What's the whole point of this if we don't set standards? There's rules and those rules have to be followed. Jo, you missed your shot. No. No. No! - Go on. Do it. - Step back. Feels different up close, doesn't it, Benjamin? - Give her the knife. - Please. I should fucking shoot you, Krys. - Give her the knife. - Give me the knife. I could do this. I could do this! God bless. There you are. - It's done. - There, you see? I told you you could do it. Yeah. Easier than I thought. Well done, Alice. The story surrounding yesterday's assassination of the US Senator John Kyle continues to unfold. Further bodies believed to be connected to the case have been found in a church in the bank area of London. Early speculation suggests that the US Government was somehow involved in the plot against Kyle. As of yet, there has been no comment from the American Embassy. There's always gonna be people who need our help. People who have the itch, who just need to be shown the path. They need someone who can listen, who can help. I can't go on forever, but for my girls... this is just the beginning. Hello? Hello? Lovely night for it. Yeah. I suppose it is. You lost your way? Something like that. It's one flight down. Oh. I see. Thanks. Don't look so nervous. You're in good hands. - Hey. - Hi. I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. I was told to say "Gemini." Definitely in the right place, and the first to arrive. Welcome to Killers Anonymous.
