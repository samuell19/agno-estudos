The waves roll on and on They wash away the world's affairs But they can't tell joy from sorrow Nor can they tell success from failure Do you know if I love you or hate you? My passion is like an endless river The waves can't calm the struggles Nor can they tell joy from sorrow Even if they can tell joy from sorrow They surf into the ocean And make me emotional - Let's go home. - OK. You don't look like a local. I'm here to seek a friend. Fights and killings are common here. Where does your friend live? At 5 Joffre Avenue. A good address, though now pulled down. Where have the tenants moved to? No idea, but you can stay at a hotel. How much would that cost a night? Then, are you afraid of rats? Here it is. Let's go in. Mother, this is my friend. Sit down. Ma'am, I'm Hsu Wen-chiang. Please sit, Mr. Hsu. Thank you. Mother, he'll spend the night here. OK, but... It's all right, I'll sleep on the ground. It's cramped up here, Mr. Hsu. Sorry for the trouble. I still don't know your name. I'm Ting Li. My late father wanted me to be strong. - In fact, I'd prefer to be a pony. - Why? At least I'd be well fed. Mother, go to bed first. Care for a pear? Thank you. Isn't there running water here? We can't afford it. Li. He's Feng Chin-yao, a wealthy man in the French Concession. Even the French are afraid of him. But don't ask about his past. He was a fruit hawker. This is common in Shanghai, ups and downs, rags to riches. Take it easy. I'll sleep first. Do you have to work tomorrow? No, but no plans either. If I were rich, I could visit Paramount. Have you been to Paramount? Never even dreamed of it. But you have a rich friend. I know they often go to St. John's Cathedral. What's your friend's name? Fang Yen-yun. Wen-chiang. Yen-yun. Let's talk outside. Are you surprised? One can change. Yes, but you've changed too much. In fact, you've completely changed. What I remember of you Forget the past. Why? I wish I could forget everything that happened in Peking. Including the relationship between you and me? Why would I? You're my friend. I came to see you as soon as I arrived. What are your plans? Nothing in particular. If it's possible, can I live at your place? I don't mind sleeping in the living room. Sure. Maybe I could find work for you. Mr. Hsu, why don't you dance? I prefer to watch you dance. My cousin is quiet. Is he? He'll change quickly after some time in Shanghai. Recently we've received some Indian silk. Would you like to see it? Let's not talk about this now. You haven't answered my question yet. What is it? You have a terrible memory. You promised to find work for my cousin. Oh, that's it? Easy peasy. He's a Peking University graduate. Would he care to work for me? Mr. Lee, don't say that. Nowadays, scholars have no prospects. Don't put it that way. You said you were seeking a supervisor. Yes, but in Shanghai one must be flexible. Even working in a theater one has to It may not suit a gentleman like Mr. Hsu. Mr. Lee, I think you misunderstood. Not every scholar is weak. Yes, but But what? Don't make any excuses. Calm down! If Mr. Hsu doesn't mind the humble pay, I promise to help him. Mr. Lee, thank you. Here, have some sweets from England. Thank you. Come in. What's your order, sir? Where's Ping? He's gone to play mahjong. Ping's in charge of my theaters. Maybe you could help him. Take Mr. Hsu to see Ping. Tell Ping to show you around. Yes. Please wait. Brother Ping. Please excuse me. Take my place. Come back soon. - OK. - Remember. This is Mr. Hsu. The boss sent him here to help you. Just call me Wen. No, I'd better call you Mr. Hsu. You were recommended by the chairman. He's new here and he promised to buy us a meal. Right, Mr. Hsu? Sorry, I'm busy tonight. I never thought you were so capable. Boss, our theaters need renovation. Now the Grand Theater is first class, Lido is second, and ours is the third. So, you want to make us first class? No problem with theaters like those in Tibet Road or Nanking Road. That means If renovated, our theaters could possibly compete with Lido. Business has much improved since the renovation. That scholar really has a way. Shut up! I've checked on him. He was jailed in Peking. What for? No idea. Better check again. Brother Ping. They've snatched the film. The film's been snatched Those men are from Lido. After them! Now things will get interesting. This is outrageous! Boss, what are you going to do about it? Mobilize all of our men. Wen, don't you agree? If we all go, there'll only be chaos. THE LIDO THEATER Tell your boss I want to see him. Who are you? Hsu Wen-chiang. Come in! Mr. Hsu, this way please. Leave us. Mr. Hsu, please have a seat. Want a cigarette? Thanks. Mr. Mo, do you know why I'm here today? I don't know. You don't? Had you brought a group of men, I would've known why. I can carry one reel of film alone. Are you Lee's new right hand man? Each of us has his own customers. Now, why did you do it? Lido has suffered a heavy drop. I don't want my men to go broke. Mr. Mo, what is it that you want then? Can you speak for Lee? Yes. Since you're doing such good business, how about... giving us shares in your company? Any profit will make up for our compensation. Mr. Mo, do you think there'll be enough profit for two? There will be in Shanghai, though not elsewhere. What if we don't agree? You may still take the film back. Don't do anything stupid. How many shares do you want? Fifty-one. Mr. Mo, don't get tough with me. OK? Do you have to consult Lee first? You really are arrogant. You're new here. You don't understand. Go and ask Lee how he got started. What if I say no and still take the film? Try then. I mean to. Chung! Destroy the film! Do it! Mr. Mo, I want you to return it personally. Go! Mr. Mo, you talk to them. Don't try anything stupid. Let's go! Wen, you're fantastic! You made it even alone. Boss, you're drunk. Drunk? I am not. Ping, you could've done better. You couldn't even control the situation. You must learn from Wen. Anyone dares to fight burly Wei? Winner gets a dollar, anyone? Winner gets a dollar, anyone up for the challenge? I will do it. Pay 10 cents first. Please. Brother, brother, you've won. Hold on. What about my money? Hey, my stall. Are you going to pay? What happened? I won, but he wouldn't pay me. I'll pay you for him. - Sir. - I need to ask you a favor. The man you must kill is 25-26. He'll go with an escort and the theater boss to Paramount. Wait for him outside and take action when he's out. Please. You failed? What do you want? Why are you back so late? Li, what happened to your arm? I got involved in a fight. I'll get you some medicine. No need. Mother, go to bed. You're Ma'am. I'm Hsu Wen-chiang. I spent a night here once. Oh, Mr. Hsu, glad you're here. Li has been hurt in the arm, but he won't have it treated. Ma'am, I'll give him a piece of my mind. Thank you, thank you. Now, what's been going on? They wanted to kill me. Who hired you? Ko Ping-chiang? I didn't know they wanted me to kill you. No time to explain now. You've bled too much. You must be hospitalized, or you may die. The doctor has given you a blood transfusion. Does mother know I am in a hospital? I've told her. I've bought a new house. I'll let her stay there for a few days. Why did you rescue me after what happened? I want you to cooperate with me. Cooperate? Don't you know we're both in danger? They still want to kill me, and you too. Now we're both in the same boat. We must work together against him. How? The only way is to kill him. If you agree, I'll offer you... the same terms Ping offered. How does that sound? You saved my life. Anything you say. Mr. Hsu. He's here. Brother Ping. No weapons allowed. It's the boss' order. Mind if I search you? Sorry. It's for self-defence. Thank you, Brother Ping. Mr. Hsu. Please. I've brought you here to settle what happened that night. Someone tried to murder Wen. I heard it was one of our own men. Who did it? He even tried to kill me. If we find out who it is, what shall we do to him? Kill him. According to our rules, a traitor dies. Ping, I want to ask you something. Forget it. It was me who tried to kill him. Good, you've admitted it. You know it's unacceptable. Yes, but you won't kill me. Take him! Stop! Stop! Do you hear me? Now our boss is dead, and so is Ping. Why should we kill each other? Wen, what shall we do now? Of course, Wen will take his place. Wen is the most suitable, right? You're right. Yes, there's no one better suited than you. Without you, we'll lose our jobs. Do you agree? Yes, we're all for him. Wen, we're all for you! Excuse the poor hospitality. Please wait. Mr. Feng, there are guests. Excuse me. Here they are Mr. Feng, I'm Ting. Mr. Ting. This is Hsu Wen-chiang. I visited but you were out. I was out for business. Wait. Feng Ching-yao's home. Come in! Brother, what happened to you? Captain Chen wants to see you. Help him in, quickly. What shall we do? Bring him in. Mr. Feng, I want to talk to you. So, you're Captain Chen of the Blue Squad. Blue Squad? This is my property. I won't allow any arrests here. I'll wait for him outside, then. He was hit, and won't last long. Captain Chen, although you're the captain, don't you forget that this is the French Concession. You've no right to make arrests here. Mr. Feng, don't you forget that my squad's nicknamed the Ruffians. Where there's no jurisdiction, we'll resort to any means. It's funny how you call yourselves Ruffians. And I couldn't care less about you. Calling my superior? He won't help you. The man I'm after is a traitor. You can't accuse anyone without evidence. Think it over. I'll wait outside. Remember, heavy bleeding can kill. Send Dr. Fang at once. The bullet must be removed by surgery, otherwise he may die. Can the surgery be performed here? No, there's no equipment and I'm no surgeon. Why can't he be sent to a hospital? I'll try. Watch him for a while. Are you in trouble? Let's go in and talk. Sure. We can help you, Mr. Feng. That would be great. Let's act quickly, then. Mr. Hsu, you're really straightforward. I can handle it alone. Don't you trust me? Stay alert. I'll go and get help. My daughter is returning from Peking tomorrow. I'll go with you to meet her at the station. Father! Freeze! Who told you to shoot? Don't shoot! Come over and I'll kill her. Don't shoot! Retreat! Quick! What is it? What happened? Come over, and she'll be dead. Who told you to shoot? Sit here, don't move! Cheng. Sir, they're inside. Listen, surround this place. Team A here, Team B there. Listen, you've been surrounded. You can't get away. Shut up. Listen, I won't surrender. Mr. Feng, what shall we do? Brother Chiang, you always have a way. I'll try. Kuang, give your gun to Chiang. Be careful. Hey pal... my gun's loaded with six bullets. I want to talk to you. Only then can we reach an agreement. Talk. I want to talk to you alone. Turn around and walk backward to the window. Stay there and speak. May I come in? Are you afraid of me? OK, come in. Don't try to be funny. Talk. None of us wants to die, including you, me and her. If anything happens to her, we're finished. Free her and you'll be safe. You expect me to free her? Is that all you want to say? Listen, if I free her, I'll face a hail of bullets. I know. So, I have a way out. I'll get a car to take us to a safe place. Then, I'll let you go. What do you think? Are my driving skills your concern? If the car's all right, you'll be all right. Your only risk is my betrayal. I'm not from SMC, why would I? Can you think of any way... besides this? Well, I'll trust you this time. This way. Fire! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You could've killed my daughter. You're smart... Just shoot me. It isn't my fault. They're nervous. No more nonsense. Kill me. I'll keep my promise. You'll die out there. Wait for my return. I'll bring a car. I promised the gunman to send him out by car. Use my car. Quick! All right, get off here. I'll remember you. You don't seem scared. I can hardly breathe. You're my father's Friend. I've never met you before. I've only recently met your father. Thank you for saving me. I heard that you studied in Peking. The Peking Public School. Is it the one near Chang An Street? Have you been to Peking? I went to university there. Really? Good. Be sure to look for me and let's talk about Peking. Since we parted, Wen-chiang never came to see me. Father said he often came to this church. Will I meet him by chance? - What a coincidence. - It's you. You're here too. Not leaving yet? I'm waiting for my girlfriend. I have some urgent business. See you again. Hope to see you soon. Goodbye. Cheng, what's on your mind? Found your Prince Charming? Is that him? He sure is good-looking. It's a pity he had to leave early. Remember, love should come naturally. Understand? It's cold. It's going to snow. Let's go. I want to take a walk. Excuse me then. - Bye. - Bye. Didn't you say you were busy? I've found something more important. Have you? Anything more important than business? Don't you remember you wanted to talk with me about Peking? Yes, but I thought you've forgotten. How could I forget? You're special among my father's friends. It's snowing. Where did you go? Just for a walk. With whom? None of your business. Do you remember that Feng wanted us to join his clan? Isn't that good for us? That's not the point. We might be under his control. They say he mixes with the Japanese. What has that to do with us? Of course it does. If he's a traitor, we mustn't join him. Don't worry too much. We'd better be cautious. Mr. Feng is not like that. Li, when one needs you, he'll be nice to you. When he doesn't... Wen, you're mistaken. He wouldn't have succeeded for nothing. Let's drop the subject. Sorry, Wen. Let's not talk about it anymore. Have you seen Cheng lately? I approached her only to find out if he's tied to the Japanese. What have you found? She knows little about her father. What if she falls in love with you? I won't let it happen. This is for you, a bow tie I bought at Laidlaw. It's French-made. Open it and see for yourself. Do you like it? Do you want to hear the truth? I'll believe anything you say. I don't really like this color. I'll change it for you then. What... What color do you like? Forget it, I'll pay for it myself. It's a gift from me. Do you enjoy giving gifts? Not particularly. Why should I accept it? Is 100 enough? Forget the money, but not tonight's dinner. Cheng, Wen has another appointment. He wanted me He wanted you to come instead? He promised to come. You must be hungry. Let's order. Wen, she's drunk. Why didn't you stop her? She wouldn't listen. Why did you bring her here? Wen, bring her a hot towel. Take her home. Mr. Feng will blame me. Next time, don't let her drink. Why is it always my fault? Give her a bowl of ginger soup. San, don't mind her. Take her home and leave it to her family. Where's your conscience? She's drunk because of you. You shouldn't have promised her! Li. I'm not as smart as you. What are you saying? Why didn't you tell her frankly? I tried to hint. She wouldn't understand if you minced words. I didn't want to hurt her. But now you've broken her heart. And worse still, you've ruined her life. I know how to handle it. You've no right to deceive her like that. Take her home. Do it yourself! Cheng. Father. Good girl, don't cry! Don't cry. Just tell father what it is. Don't cry. I've decided to study in France. Hello? Wait, a call for you, Miss. It's for you. Thank you. Hello? I'm Wen-chiang. Make it quick. I'm going to the airport. I love you. Goodbye. San. San, open the door. You said you didn't like this. Why are you here? Don't you have a flight to catch? I knew since we met that I can't live without you. How dare you bite me! Trying to run? Little scoundrel! You're really naughty. Sorry, it's mine. It's OK, I like dogs. It's cute. Are you OK? He's always full of mischief. He's a nice puppy. Goodbye. Miss, miss Yes? Would you care to have a breakfast with me? Thank you, but I've already had mine. Well, let's have a lunch then. Who is it? Is Miss Chia Yi-jen in? What's your name? I'm Ting Li. Kuei, who's here? Morning, - Miss Chia. - Good morning. ...this is for you. It's an unlucky color. Thank you. They smell good. Put them in a vase. But they're unlucky. Take them. Have a seat. Have you been out? No. Shall we go now? Don't you walk him every morning? Yes. I'll go and get my coat. Mr. Chin, what a coincidence! Kuei, who's here? Are we leaving or not? What's wrong? Sorry, I have to leave. You afraid? Everybody knows he's ruthless. So what? We didn't offend him. I... I was his mistress. What? How could you Forget it. Let's go. I don't want to get you involved. I'm not afraid. Let's go. Let me in. Don't! Go home, it's late. I'll see you in. I already said no. Why not? I'm afraid of drunkards. I'll walk you to the door. OK. Wait, I'm not your puppy! Wait, I'm not your puppy! You said you're drunk but you're not. Of course not. It's late. Go home. Good night. Bye. Bye. Wine and women, what a life! Where's Chin? Come with us if you want to see him. Tell him to come here to see me. Mr. Ting's an important man. Be polite to him. Mr. Ting, let's go. What do you want? Just come with us. Stay right where you are! What's so funny? Out with it! Boss! Do you know who Yi-jen is to me? She's my mistress. It's a pity she treats you like a puppy. What? She treats you like a dog! I know Feng thinks highly of you and I don't want to offend his friend. But to survive in this world, one must observe the rules. You blatantly disgraced me. What would people think of me? What do you want now? To regain my dignity. You've already beaten me up. Mr. Ting, that's nothing. Chin Ta-kang, what do you want? I want you and Hsu to apologize publicly to me in the presence of all societies of Shanghai. With Mr. Feng present as well? Of course. I don't want him to think that I've mistreated his friend. How can we face the world any more? Don't worry, I would never do that. Does Mr. Hsu know about it? I haven't told him yet. Don't you tell him. I caused this... and I'll fix it myself. What? Don't you trust me? It's not that, but it's better to tell him. Mr. Hsu is not the only capable one. Mr. Chin, how do you like that? What do you want? You still want me to apologize in public? No. You look like a dog begging for mercy. Forget the past. Forget it? You made a big mistake. You shouldn't have spared my life. I won't be as stupid as you. I should've come earlier. He would kill me if I didn't kill him. Li, you've made a mistake. I have not. His death will bring us trouble. Chin's men won't dare to do anything. What about the other societies? They won't be affected. Now that Chin's dead, the other societies will not just sit and watch. Now, they'll combine forces against us. I've arranged for Feng to be our middleman. But it's a pity Why do I always make mistakes? Forget it. We must stick together. What has happened? How could they have acted so fast? Go now! Quick! Are you all right? Run quickly! Run! Wen, are you all right? Yes. Brother Wen, I am sorry! Li, what are you saying? Now all our efforts have been for nothing. This is nothing new in Shanghai. Everything can be lost in one day. - Brother Wen. - Forget it. Forget it. We can start over again. Let's find a safe place to hide. I want to bring my mother. OK. Wen, what do you want to say? Li, someone must be happy to see our plight. Father, what's so funny? Cheng, why are you still awake? I want to talk to you. Who is keeping you awake? No one. I have good news for you. What news? Hsu Wen-chiang will soon work for me. Really? Yes, if all goes well. Mr. Feng. Is everyone here yet? Everyone, except Liang and Chao. Sit down, everybody. Bring tea. Let's not wait. Everyone, these are Hsu and Ting. Mr. Feng. Looks like you had a lot of fun last night. Sit down. This will take hours. I'm Chien Chung's General Manager, but I don't handle the business myself. I've left everything to Kuang Jen, and I've seen Kuang Jen's efforts. It is my duty. Now I feel it's time for me to retire from this role. And I'm going to appoint Hsu Wen-chiang as my successor. He's still not too experienced, so I hope you will help him. Sorry, sir, I'm late. Let me introduce, this is Mr. Feng. This is Mr. Ohshima, a director of SMC. Nice to meet you. I can't in any way match Mr. Feng. Mr. Ohshima, you must be joking. Have a seat. Please sit. I heard SMC's looking for three more Chinese directors. This was decided last night. Please see what you can do for us. Many parts of China are leased territories. We'd like to coordinate management for you, but we can't directly import weapons. With your influence in Shanghai, if you agree to help us, things would be easier. I'll count on you. I'm so happy to hear that. Let me help you. Mr. Feng, what's your order? Put off other things first and do one thing for me. What is it, Mr. Feng? Madam Yokoda is coming from Tokyo tomorrow. Send some men to protect her. Yes. Madam, this is Hsu Wen-chiang. This is Ting Li. They're my right hand men. I'll introduce you to another friend. This is Mr. Pan... Have you ever seen this girl before? No. She looks familiar. I must've seen her. She's the prettiest girl I've ever met. PEKING DUCK RESTAURANT Mad'm, you speak excellent Chinese. I was born in China. Her father's Chinese. Her Chinese name is Li Shu-lan. What are your orders? Do you know why we must tail the Japanese? No. Outwardly, they are merchants. Sentaro claimed to be an HR Manager, and Ohshima, a General Manager. In fact, they're Tien Lung members. Japanese spies? They can't work openly in Shanghai due to foreign influence. No wonder they've made hotel reservations. Some VIPs are coming. Yes, a woman's here. A woman? What's so special about her? She's a famous spy active in North China, who has killed many of our martial artists, Yamaguchi Kohko. What are her distinguishing features? None, except that she wears a string of bells. We have orders to take her alive. Why are you so late? I was followed by Ching Wu's men. They're really interfering. Sooner or later they'll come up here. Have you no way of countering it? Our work has only just started here. We really can't cope with Ching Wu. Have you heard of the saying, "Killing one as an example to hundreds"? Boss. Mr. Chao. - Give me two cups of tea. - Sure. Ming, let's go. Master, run. Sorry. Yamaguchi Kohko. Master, master, are you all right? Master! Do you recognize this bell? You can get them at any store. Yes, but if someone wore it all the time, surely you'd notice it. Madam Yokoda? It's Yamaguchi Kohko, chief of Tien Lung Society. Yes, Master was killed by her. Madam Yokoda is a killer. Yamaguchi is China's public enemy. What do you want from me? Where can I find Yamaguchi Kohko? Sorry, I can't help you. Well, I'll set all Japanese property on fire and wait for her to find me. Li, what would you do if it were you? We should help him. We're all Chinese. But Feng is Yamaguchi's good friend. Only in business. I hope so. So, Mr. Hsu, you know Chado too. Chado is really a refined enjoyment. The civilized appreciate it. I couldn't tell that you're such a cruel person. What do you mean? You know what I mean, Yamaguchi Kohko. I have no ties with Ching Wu's master, but the news of his death distress me. How did you know my identity? Madam, when did you buy this? Did you bring me here today for this? Madam, we're only business acquaintances. Don't worry, I won't expose your secret. If I can make Feng an SMC Director, I can help you as well. Madam, I only work with Chinese, not Japanese. I see that you don't want success. I will not break my principle. That's not very pleasant to me. "The kiss of death" is a Chinese idiom. My Chinese teacher also taught me that a hero must be adaptable. What do you think? Thanks for your time. Excuse me. Please, Mr. Hsu. Goodbye. Mr. Hsu, the cargo will arrive soon. Thanks to you, Mr. Sentaro. No, we work for Madam Yokoda. Let's go, my car is there. Mr. Hsu, be careful. We're being followed. - Bastard! - Stop! Ming, run! Feng Ching-yao, listen. Are your men for or against us? Well, I'll trust you this time. Mr. Feng, what did Madam Yokoda say? Everything is as planned. Since Cheng is in love with him, I must observe him. Good, I'll make delivery then. No need, I'll send Wen-chiang. What? Wen-chiang? It's all right. This will give us an opportunity to test his loyalty, so we don't have to beware of him forever. Come in. Mr. Feng, you were looking for me? I have a task for you. What is it? Deliver a batch of cargo from the warehouse to Madam Yokoda at 10:00. OK, I'll arrange that. Why didn't you ask what it is? Mr. Feng, since you didn't want me to know, why should I ask? It's a batch of auto parts. Mr. Tseng, please check the cargo for me. Hold on, let me take it down. Weapons? Hold on. Don't tell anyone that I called. Thanks. May I speak to Liu Ming? Feng brought some guns for the Japanese. The delivery is due tomorrow. Go and steal them tonight and meet me tomorrow, but don't get me involved. Mr. Hsu's punctual. We must depart in 15 minutes. You two can then leave. The guns are gone! All gone! The guns are gone! Let me see. Mr. Hsu, how do you explain this? I had no idea. Mr. Hsu is not in charge of the arms. Who who could have known about it? We must leave at once. Be careful. Yes. Yamaguchi, stay where you are. Never expected you to win. Madam. Mr. Hsu, are you all right? I've killed her at last. Mr. Hsu, you really are our benefactor. I killed her only in self-defence. Mr. Hsu, Feng won't let you go. Why don't you join the Ching Wu clan? Your clan? You think you can protect me? I'd better find my own way. With Feng's status in Shanghai, will Hsu be able to escape? Find out in the next episode.
