Sir, let's send a negotiator and try to reason with them Reasoning with them won't work They are adamant. Our only option is to release those men. What are you saying, Sikander? Absolutely impossible! Know how many have died because of these men? We have no other go, Mr.Patvardhan. The country is dreading a huge communal riot. But the nation is above everything. This happens every day. But the minister must be saved. He is sincere and can't be sacrificed. We can't bend to their demands! Stop it, I say! Is the minister the only one held hostage there?

Anitha here! Welcome to our show: 'Modern Farming'! No rains and no water! The delta districts are all dried up But this place alone is green and fertile! Modern famer Mr. Kathiravan is responsible for this magic! Vermi compost made from waste Solar energy, Wind energy Drip irrigation! Organic pesticide! Organic manure! Combining science and traditional methods, Mr. Kathiravan is making strides. Good morning, Kathiravan. Tell us about your organic farming. It's nothing but, natural farming. Much more efficient than organic farming. Farming bound to nature. You know who started this? Masanobu Fukuoka. I've heard of vodka. But Fukuoka? He is Masanobu Fukuoka. A Japanese farmer and philosopher. Without depleting natural resources, we rely completely on human resources. We do not let fertilizers or pesticides anywhere near us. Awesome, Kathir! I love baby corn! It can be eaten raw! Have a taste. Ah! It's unbelievable, viewers! It's heaven in my tongue right now! What's this, sir? A pay-to-use toilet? -You're right! -Another source to your income? A side business? It is a pay-and-use toilet, but we pay for it. If you poop here, you get 10 rupees. Wow! Very different approach. Hold on! There's a bit of selfishness to this, too. -Selfishness? -Come here. I'll explain. I've used this five times. You owe me fifty rupees! Buzz off, moron! Look here, lady! I can swear upon this at any temple! To hell with you and your swearing! -Swearing on feces? -Did you see me poop? Why should I witness the mess? Kathir, he claims to have dysentry and used the toilet five times. He's demanding 50 rupees. Expect me to monitor him with CCTV cameras? -Just pay the man! -It's money, Son. -Give it! -Here, beat it! Be polite, mom. Important suppliers, right? Brother, why leave without the money? I can't take money that isn't earned. I tried pooping, but nothing came. I'll come later to poop and get the money. Such people in our town, too? Are you coming or not, Mangamma? A profit of 10 rupees! -Let's wrap up the interview first. -I'm on my way. Could've sent half the people there? That filled up six months ago. So we've locked it up and stored it. Why save up this stuff? Good question! In six months, it dries up, gets degraded by bacteria... ...and becomes good manure. Here you go. It doesn't emit foul odor. It's nitrogen rich, Pure black gold! -Black Gold! -What? -If you use this as manure... -Yuck! It helps with soil aeration, seed germination, root spreading... ...and leads to bountiful crop. When you ate that corn, mentioned great taste and aroma. You said your tongue was in heaven! Hey, don't puke over here! Shall we go for a break, ma'am? Enough of this interview. Let's go! -Damn, I should've never come here! -Did I invite you here? Thought you were doing organic farming, but you're doing some crap... -...and deceiving the people -Hold on! Hey, Turn on the camera! Farming is not a job. Like cops who guard a city and troops who guard the nation... ...it is a service that guards human lives! This Earth is magical. It turns any waste that falls upon it into something useful. It's what we do the Earth that is disgusting! We felled forests and there is no rain. We mined all sand. Even if there is rain, we cannot harvest it. Farming's already dying. And harmful chemicals poison the soil. What we have is just waste. To reclaim this soil, the Chinese and the Japanese got into this farming. If you install tube wells and mines on agricultural land, there is no other go, we have to agree to these methods. This is your future! In the south west of Bay of Bengal, a depression formed due to low pressure. This depression is centered on Kodiyakarai in the Nagai district... ...and a cyclone is expected there. Owing to this, Category 10 emergency has been declared. Hey, What is this injection? This is illegal. I must be taken to the court. Hey! No! No, no, no! Whatever you do... ...you cannot even find out my name. His name's Syed Jafar. Age 38. Your name's Syed Jafar. Age 38. At the Jalalabad camp for the Pakistan army... ...you were trained. You're an expert at designing IED bombs. Six months ago, you underwent surgery... ...and was in the hospital for ten days. Hey! I don't care about my life. But you worry about your Prime Minister's life. The next attack won't miss. Next attack? Where is it? He's taking a flight in London, right? He'll return only in a coffin. Your Prime Minister. He is not lying, sir. It is the truth. London? Who's carrying this out in London? Which group? No group. Only one man. He's hidden among the people. He will destroy your country's strength! Suraj! Suraj! Check if anyone has come? Tell me where he is right now? I won't! -Irfan! -I won't Give him another shot. Doctor, give him another shot. No! Don't! I don't want an injection! This injection... I'm short of breath Tell me! -I'll tell you -where he is now? I'll tell you! He's in Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu? -He is... -Tell me his name I'll tell you -His name... -His name? His name... What is it? Damn it! The cattle feed has arrived, Kathir. Boss told me to drop it off at the barn. Did Gopal give you the bill for this? It's in the vehicle. Quickly show it to me and settle the dues. Dear passengers, I would like to announce the arrival of British Airways Flight P83X. From Chennai to London Heatthrow. Kindly collect your baggages from belt seven. -Hello. -Vanakkam Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister. My son, Abhishek. -Hi, sir. Nice to meet you. -Hello C-12 team, is the convoy ready to move? Affirmative, C-1. Good to go. Kavitha Menon from Malayalam Manorama. Have security over here. Venkatraman from Dhina Garudan. It's me! Kalyan Kumar, From Express. Kalyan Kumar, From Express? There are three lakh Indians in the UK. And they happen to be the third largest ethnic group here. Mr. Kalyan Kumar from Express? Hi, Yes. You could've come early. Even if I had, it's the same lecture. So? Is that a reason to be late? I will wait there. This is the purpose of tomorrow's meeting. I hope all of you will be here tomorrow and support us... ...by giving wide and detailed coverage for this conference. I guess we are done. -I will see you tomorrow. -Okay, bye. Hey! -Yes, throw it here, man! -Careful. Alright. The Invest in India meet starts in a few minutes. If you have phones, mobiles or wallets, you can place them in the tray here Next please. Please open your bag. Thank You. Next please. -Marc! Clear the PM's passage. -Definitely! Please arrange for the media gathering, sir. No, I've just come for a holiday. Our Honorable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Chandrakanth Varma is here. Thanks. When I see you all, feels like I've come to a relative's house for a wedding Let's talk casually, alright? How many of you had love marriages? -Mr. Mahadevan! -Sir! Plenty of love stories in your biography, I see. You're silent now... -Up! -That's it That mutual magnetic charm which was there before marriage... The desire to see and talk to each other every day... Is it at the same level even after marriage? Or it has come down? Why hesitate? If yes, raise your hand. Alright, I'll bravely raise my hand first. Because my wife is not here. I raise it unafraid. Don't humiliate us. Mrs. Narayana Murthy. At least let him speak the truth here. Let's now talk about our mother. Is there a mother who does not love her child? That same mom would threaten us so we'd eat when we were kids. She'd strictly make us study. She'd pummel us when we were mischievous. We would've scolded her then, too... But has the love between us ever reduced? No. Even if you're all well settled here, this place is like a girlfriend. But India is like a mother! There are issues like corruption, bribery, religious and language conflicts... ...in India which need to be immediately addressed. My government has gone knee deep into solving these issues. You must help out, too. At least once a year, visit India with your family. Introduce your roots to your offsprings! The major industrialists who have settled here, must help India's growth. My government will support you. To inspire you all, I would like to introduce a few gentlemen here. Must the arrow of the Indian SENSEX point up or down? Their companies here decide that. Mr. Vijay Mathur, The seventh richest man in the world. He doesn't own property across the world. No money stashed in the Swiss Bank. -Wow, it's a gun. -Whatever he earned... ...he has invested only in India. The king of rubber, Mr. Arun Swaminathan. That man has a gun, mom! Which man? Where? Look there! -Look there! -Boom! Mr. Rajan Mahadevan Rather than telling you the kind of work he does... ...it's easier to say what he doesn't do! Anytime a party comes into power, decisions based on trade in the country we consult him for an opinion. He's an advisor not on payroll. Thank You. It's our duty to work for our family. But it is pride to work for our nation. So be proud to be an Indian. And invest in India. Jai Hind. Extraordinary! -Fantastic! -Good speech. Training trip, Abhi? Is your dad preparing his heir to succeed him? No way, uncle! He doesn't even let me ride with him. Claiming I wanted to hear his speech live, I lied and tagged along. If that's a lie, what's the truth? You shouldn't ask such questions at your age, and I can't answer them, too. Alright. Let's not get into that. Charlie 1 to team, Tiger en route to Chariot. Shots been fired, secure the Indian Prime Minister. Emergency Distress, all units to route B. Secure exit. Secure exit B. Come on! Move! Move aside. Dad! Dad! Let go off me... -Abhi! -Dad... Second chariot! Just give him cover! Keep moving fast! Move! Go! Go! Go! Go! Please move! -Come on -Get to the exit Go! Go! Go! Go! Let go of me! -Open the door! -Move! -Clear! Clear! Clear! -Dad are you ok? Chariot en route! Escorting the Prime Minister en route to the Presidential's Palace. -He's speaking to the Indian Prime Minister -Mayor of London has come to meet Inidan PM I'm extremely sorry, Mr. Prime Minister. This should not have happened in our country. It's alright. It could've happened anywhere. I don't know how remain so calm? It's quiet simple. I'm not dead. Well, I don't want to take much of your time. Good day! Kathir. Come. Sir, Kathiravan. Senior officer: Military Intelligence We were batch mates, Sir. -Sit down. -Yes, sir. For the last five years, he's worked undercover on many assignments. In a town called Jashna a plant which manufactured Nuclear weapons was in operation unknown to the rest of the world. To expose them with supporting evidence he worked undercover for 6 months at a saloon. He collected hair samples from a scientist who went there for a haircut... ...and sent it to India through our agents working at a fruit shop nearby. -It's a ripe fruit, keep it. -One more? Thank you. On testing it in the lab, we found traces of Plutonium 239. Only with Plutonium 239, can you make a nuclear bomb. A double agent from our department betrayed them... ...Kathir and his team were arrested by the Pakistan army. Police! I won't come! Oh God! They brutally tortured him but he didn't utter a word After that, he escaped from there and reached India. You're the real heroes. But you can't be commended in public. These are secrets operations, Sir. Even felicitations must be in secret. It's all for the nation, sir. He just mentioned that you ran the operation which destroyed a military godown in Kodiyakarai.... Do you know why you had to do that? No, sir. We're never given reasons. Neither we ask them. What you destroyed there were chemical weapons. When ethnic cleansing happened in Sri Lanka... ...to help their nation's military through an arms agent they bought these chemical weapons and stocked them in secret. It is against the UN arms treaty. Got that, Sir. It's absolutely an illegal scam. No matter who the government was, it would've stained India. How long can we keep it concealed? You selected the right time. Unaware of what they were guarding... ...you even saved the lives of the security guards. The cyclone managed to put an end to the chemical weapons before it could be used against the city. As penance for the previous Government's mistake we had to do this. You are a good actor, Kathiravan. You know everything yet pretend that you don't. Sir... To do a good deed, a few bad deeds must be done. Legally wrong, but ethically right, yes? If Duryodhana shoots an arrow, it's unjust. If Arjuna does so, it isn't. You have made my day. I like you, young man! -Joseph -Sir... What must be done for him to stay with me? Simple, Sir. He must be relieved from military intelligence... -...and deputed to the SPG. -Do it. Done, sir. Gulf 1 to G2, update security status. All positions secured. Step out, buddy! Let me drive the car. Sir, Sir. You're not supposed to drive yourself I understand, but I have a date. -Let me tour London -Please understand our protocol -Don't keep me cooped up in here -Sir, please! -Sir... -Don't worry, I'll be safe. -..I'll be fired, Sir. -I'll be back in an hour, alright? Won't let me do it, huh? Come along! Alright, Sir. Guys follow the car. Hold down, please! What happened, Anjali? Hey, where are you going? Hold on. I'll be back. His face is covered by the flag. Ya! Excuse me. The terrorist who escaped just walked past me. Whom do you mean? That reporter from Express. I already filed a complaint. Whom do I call, sir? You needn't call anyone. I'll handle it. I'm following him near the Tower Bridge. Send in the force quickly! -none of the cameras has caught his face -Alright, I'll send it. Watch it.

I must hand you over to them. -Hello -It's 4:30, ma'am We're already late. We must be at the airport in ten minutes. Oh God! I'll get ready. No! Let me go! Thanks for the memorable night. NO! Tell me about that lady with the Hyderabad Biryani! Hyderabad Biryani Aunty? Which lady do you mean? Tell him yourself about what you scored -It's... -Why are you chatting to him, sir? Know who he is? He's a criminal! Anjali, he's with military intelligence! Without him, my father would be dead! Did you go to a bar in London? Still not out of the funk? He told me, Anjali. All this fuss from just wine? My God! What did he say? I only told him about what happened in the bar, not in the room. He said he'll tell me the rest in the flight back. -Let's go. -Really? Alright! I don't care who you are. Please tell them nothing happened in that room, right? What never happened? I mean 'that'. Which is what? You wrote 'Thanks for a memorable night.' What did we do? Listen up! I boozed with you, too! I am drawing a blank, too If something had happened, we can find out easily. How? Our security check is this way, ma'am. Bravo 1 to Team. Approaching 'Bird' Copy, sir! Secured for approach. Have a great trip, sir. Thank You Mr. Prime Minister. It's been a pleasure. I hope you'll have a good flight. This trip was an absolute eye-opener -Yes! -Fabulous! -I'll take your leave, sir. -Oh, why? Why aren't you coming? I'll be right behind you. "Behind"? My private jet. Come with me. I need to speak with you. Alright. It's my pleasure. -How? -What do you mean 'how'? Even if anything happened, you said we could find out, how? Oh...that Ya! Let's check Do you feel exhausted? Yes. I too. Any burning sensation on the lips? Yes, I do feel that. When you woke up today, did you feel a jerk as if you had gone on a roller-coaster? I did! I think something did happen! Wait for a few days and it can be confirmed. How? Can't hide an entire pumpkin under your shirt! I come from a cultured family. Ms. Culture, whatever you wished for never happened yesterday. Happy? Did I wish to have you? Yuck! What else? What is your real name? Oh man! You boozed with a guy whose name you don't even know? Some culture you have. Come on, tell me! Kathir. Kathiravan. Forget everything that happened yesterday If you use this as an excuse and stalk me in India, I'll shoot you! Done with the discussion? Get going! Has the dispute been settled? When a girl says don't do it, she means the opposite. Hey, Kathir! What became of that Hyderabad Biryani lady? We're here for that, right? I only had a guest role there. He was the lead Tell him all about it. That aunty would've been over 40 Aunties are over 40 by default, right? I didn't mean her age The opening itself is excellent. Keep going! Charlie 2 to C9. Check out the vehicle at the North Eastern wall. Have that van removed right away. -Kathiravan. -Yes, sir? Relax. Is a military parade going on? -Be casual. Chill, man! -Yes, sir. Does it suffice to only exercise your body? Life needs some exercise too, right? If you speak like a robot, how can we respond to you? -Let me get this, sir. -No! That is not your job. Are you married, Kathiravan? -Not yet, sir. -Why? My mom said she'll find a girl among our relations. Entering North Corridor. -I don't see it happening anytime soon. -Oh, ok. Any love affairs? There was one, sir. Her name was Kayalvizhi. -Beautiful name. -Sir... She even looked beautiful, sir. After some hard wooing, we got together nicely. Excellent! What next? When marriage was near, I was dispatched to Pakistan on Intelligence duty. When I came back nine months later to see her, she was six months pregnant. Wait! When you were away for nine months, how could she be six months pregnant? Did you visit her anytime? It wasn't me, sir. She was married to another guy, six months ago. Our communication was cut off. Our love got cut off, too. That is my fate! Then how do you manage at home without a woman? I take care of that with my own hand, sir. Eh? I meant cooking, You asked about meals, right? Yes, I did! Govinda Rao! That gourd plant blooms well, but it bears no fruit. Why? I even spray it with insecticides every day, sir. You spray much insecticide, it'll drive away insects that pollinate. What do we do then? He must hand pollinate it. This is a male flower. This is a female flower. The female bears fruit. If I place one over another and rub them up together, it will pollinate. Do the same to all flowers. You'll have plenty of fruit in two days! -Alright, sir. -Got it. You are something, man! You'd probably even guide the flower through its delivery. Still sleeping, eh? Dad's back from his walk. -He's back, huh? -Wake up, He'll scold you! Dress up quickly. -Hurry up! -Give it to me, mom. Here! Give me that... Told you not to go for late night parties, Do you ever listen? Mom, spray it right Dad is here -Ah! -Alright, come! Did you work out, too? You're sweating hard. You asked me to see to it that he exercises regularly starting today. That's about it. But you're sweating so much, How long did you work out? -One hour. -Thirty minutes. First, thirty minutes. Then, a break. Then, another thirty. Mom accounted for the breaks, too. -Right, mom? -He's a good boy. You're spoiling him. [News] In the Vijayamangalam village in the Thanjavur district... ...farmers protest against deep mine tunnels.

When the troops of the 14th regiment of the Army were resting in their camps... ...twenty soldiers were killed in a surprise attack by terrorists. -This is savagery! -...were beheaded and killed brutally. How much longer will they do this? When did this happen? This morning at 5 AM, sir. You should've told me, right away! This is the fourth attack of the month. Yes, Sir. Summon the Pakistan High Commission. We need to talk. Shall I ask him to come to the office? No! Ask him to come here. In another thirty minutes Yes, sir. Defense minister too. -Yes, sir! -Ask Mr. Sarfuddin to come, too. Sure, sir. [News] They chopped up soldiers like some vegetables The Defense Minister must be sacked The Prime Minister must resign. -Hey... -There is no security -Call that man, too -even for those who safeguard the country -Namaste, Mr. Parameshwar. -Vanakkam, Sikander What trouble is the government in, now? What does Varma want me to cover up? Not that. There is a love story behind this beard. Tell me about it. -Be quiet, Abhi. -Awesome. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -How are you Mr. Jalaluddin? -Fine, Mr. Parameshwar. When we were in power, we had a train to your place. Yes, those were golden times. Peaceful days. That train brought onions, wheat and potatoes from Pakistan. That's true. Prices went down here, too. The train brought not just wheat and potatoes, but terrorists, too Ten bomb blasts and 200 deaths in those 'peaceful days'. He's a country's ambassador, Abhi. Don't talk to him like that. Why do this in the prayer room? Aren't you my God? Mr. Jalaluddin, next time the Prime Minister arrives, remind him I have a few things to discuss with him. -Salaam Alaikkum -Alaikkum assalam Good Morning, Mr. Prime Minister. This isn't a good morning, Mr. Jalaluddin. Why? Are you not keeping well? Not me, but India. at the Baramullah district in Kashmir how do you respond to the atrocity committed by your army? So you blame us for every flood or cyclone that strikes your country? This is an offensive charge, sir. Step out, Abhi. They just show on the news what happened, Mr. Jalaluddin. I'll show you some other footage, now. Watch this. This is the footage that our army sent us. Why show me this? Only to you, can I show your military's atrocities! How can you claim that our military did this? Have you arrested anyone? Did anyone give a sworn statement? The incident happened only in your part of India! You said in the Parliament that there are 65 terrorist groups. Among them, could the seventh group have done it, sir? Only if you first take responsibility, can talks continue. How can we take responsibility for a crime we didn't commit? Be realistic, Mr. Sikander. Stop blaming Pakistan for everything. You could've gathered strong evidence first and then could've asked the Ambassador to meet. Had we done so, we would not have been insulted like this. Without any evidence, it isn't right to make allegations like this. Mr. Parameshwar has a valid point. I have a lot to do and need to get back to the embassy. -Good day. -Sit down, Mr. Jalaluddin. It was your military that attacked us. He is Amiz Khan. Second Lieutenant of the 'Free Kashmir' regiment. Don't try to feed me, the theory of doppelgangers. What is your Prime Minister thinking? You messed with a peacefully sleeping tiger! It won't take long for it to attack The wings of compromise cannot fly anymore. Let me remind you about the Siachen Kargil surgical strike. Is that what Pakistan wants? When our Prime Minister comes to Delhi next week, you can discuss everything. No, I'm cancelling the program. Have him meet your military chief first. Ask him to stop this barbaric and brutal blood game. Have them denounce every terrorist group under Pakistan's support. If this happens, I'll come to your country and have tea with your Prime Minister. -I mean... -We are done. You may leave. This will only provoke them, Varma. This is a wrong decision. You're being angry. This must be handled gently. Did we do this when we were in power? Hey! Necks are lying severed there If they were a self-interested parasite like you I would not have been angry. But lying there are martyrs with severed heads, who were slogging through extreme weather to protect us. Thank You, Kathiravan. How did you know that it was Amiz Khan? Sir, please... We must retaliate, Kathiravan. Hello, wait! Why pretend to ignore me? Yes, I asked you to forget everything. So you won't even say 'hi' to me? -Hi. Bye. -Wait! Here you go. Heard you read a lot! -Who told you that? -Joseph did. I didn't search long and hard to get this for you. It was available at half-price. That's why. Don't think I'm in love with you because I gave you this. Got it? Understood. With Love, Anjali. You may think 'love' means affection, but it's just friendship. Welcome, sir. -Come in, Mr. Mahadev. -How are you? -I'm fine. -Namaste! If the business magnate came to see us in person, it must be something big! You're exaggerating, sir! But isn't that the truth? A ship building company in Maharashtra. A ship breaking company in Gujarat. Petrol, coal, marble, cement, iron and real-estate. You're part of them all! You sell onions as well as explosives. You sell telephones and sandals. Just 'kolam' powder is not on your list, I suppose. Yes, sir. But all of this didn't land on my lap on one fine day! I've hauled rice sacks! I've worked in petrol bunks. If I worked my way up and rose to the top of the business world -it is only because... -...of your hard work. No! Not just that, but government support too. One signature of yours lets me open a new factory. But another can shut it down. For what factory do you need a signature now? He hasn't come for his own business. But to help retaliate against Pakistan who often meddle in our affairs He wanted to discuss an idea with you. I'm always open to ideas. Tell me. Pakistan is our old cousin. Rather than fighting us up front, they attack us covertly. You know the power of police blows, right? They strike hard! It leaves no external mark. But every spare part within is left in shambles. We must strike a very covert blow. We must strike, But the world must not know about it. And hell, the targets themselves must not know about it! Seems exciting. Explain. Show him. -Kathir -Sir... Sir... -I'll call for it myself. -Yes, Sir. -You... -Sure! Happy anniversary, man! -Here! Go open the booze! -Thank You! Very sincere about it Can we feed her cake? You can feed her whiskey, too! It's Joseph who spoiled the cat. What did you gift Priya for your anniversary, Joseph? He doesn't do gifts. Hey, I myself am a gift to you Why do you need another gift? Did you sneak out to smoke? -Busted! -You told me you quit? That's enough of that. Between the two of you, who proposed first? -Oh...One day at the bus stop -I know this scene very well Come and act it out! -Not again! -Come over, you two! Here's your bus stop! Come on, Action! Here is my college book. Bujjima is the stray dog there. What are you staring at? This damn guy swoops in and out of ladies' hearts! So possessive! Bus stand's empty, go there! ready, continue. The buses that Priya takes keep going past The bus is ready! But no matter which bus comes, Priya enters none of them. Does this bus go to Mylapore? If you get in, it can go anywhere. I'm good to go. -Right! Right! -Hey... Asking to hear my love story, you develop yours! What's more to develop? -Oh God! -There you go! -Get started! -All of a sudden, it started to rain! -Here is your umbrella. -Oh, man! Nice touch! I am getting drenched. Indeed! Got really wet, right? Hold on! Only then will you feel a high! Before the rain stops, wrap this up. With a love letter, I hesitantly move forward and go right up before her. -Hello! -Eh... Anything you want to tell me? Whatever it is, tell me boldly. "Boldly"? Like your dog has a space under your umbrella, in your life... can I get a space in your life? I expected something better! I'll make it better. My mother is torturing me to marry my cousin. If I wed, I will only wed you. I threatened her I'd rather drink poison than not marry you. What do I do now? -Drink the poison. -Hey... I'll drink it! -Hey no! -Idiot! What a love story! Great going man! What? Tell them what happened next, rascal! Alright. -Listen... -There's a twist in the story? The dog started to lick the dripping poison. She was afraid that the dog might die. That's when I told her it won't die as there was no poison. It was just honey I bought for my mom. You deceived me with so many lies. -Awesome! -It's time for duty. I'll get going. Have dinner and go, Vivek! It's alright. See you later. Goodbye. I'm hungry, Priya. -I'll make cream pesto -I'll help you, Priya Hurry up! -Here you go, Kathir -Thanks, buddy. [News] Last night, the 'Free Kashmir' group was severely attacked. Several soldiers including Second Lieutenant Amiz Khan are dead. The identity of the attackers is still a mystery. Hey...did you do this? What do I know? Your smile tells me that you ran point on this. You're right If anything blows up anywhere, am I responsible? May be I just gave them the plan. Why are you standing up? Is that Hyderabad lady? Shall we get going? You're a real miser, man. Hey! Why not buy a diamond necklace for the fifth anniversary? Who is it? Instead, you deceive with one meager kiss. What are you looking for? Pen and paper? It's under the lampshade. You can't even memorize eight digits you don't deserve to be in Intelligence. Trichy Code. Yes, genius. Trichy airport. Who are you? Do you know who you're talking to? You're the SPG director, but even your wife doesn't respect you. Why does she play cute with your friend? Pay attention to your loved one, too! Watch your tongue, you dog! Yes, I have a sharp tongue. But I have an even longer hand. Know how long? It can stretch from here to reach what do you call it? all the way to your wife's dearest Bujjima! I can shoot your wife just like I shot her cat. Hell, I can do you guys in, too! But I wanted to show you a demo, first. Kathir? Kathir? Sorry, Priya. From the hand... ...it slipped. Too wasted, huh? You guys better clean this up! He's placed a bug in the chandelier. If they've bugged the house of the SPG director... ...I'll inform the Intelligence Bureau. Have them stream all CCTV footage from the airport right away! Why footage? He... It's him! What's up Dynamic Duo? Not bad, you caught him But how do you expect him to talk if you just tie him up? Get closer and beat it out of him Let's see what he spills. Wondering from where I'm watching all this? Go on, get closer and ask him -Ah! -Joseph! Oh shit! -Hello? -Bloody... See you in Kashmir! Kashmir? Altogether, he spoke to us for four minutes. Remove from the list those who spoke more or less than that. Ok, Sir. There's a phone on the stand, there. Please zoom in. To avoid showing his face, he's turned away from the camera. Remember the jacket he wore. Call Trichy airport Police and have them conduct a search for him. You check this side. You take that side. Hey, stop! stop! Look there. There's a bag under that phone booth, Check it out. Excuse me, sir. Your ID? -There's a bomb blast at the airport -What? At the same phone booth. Head back Hello Go for the bag! What happened? Really? Fortunately, no one was hurt. They set this blast to divert the police. It was just a harmless smoke bomb. It's not that, something fishy, man. Same symbol on the bag and the jacket. He's trying to say something. We need to find out what it is. Hello-- Yes, Sir. When was the trip decided on? Ok, Sir. The Prime Minister is going to Kashmir to survey the flooded areas. They asked us to go as part of the advanced team. This was decided upon only an hour ago. The Kashmir trip was decided only an hour ago. How did he know about it? Don't touch my turban. Vicky, there are men on your right sporting black flags Clear them out. Please get up and come with me. "Praise be to the motherland." This bridge was heavily damaged by the flood. People have to travel an additional seven kilometers because of this. Lead 1 Eagle 1 we'll cross the market in another three minutes. Victor ETA 5 minutes. Over! -Kathir! -Sir... Have you heard about Caelifera? Do you know anything about it? Caelifera? Not exactly, sir. Think it's some kind of bug. -Shall I look it up? -No, it's fine. It's ok. Sir, You're way too stressed, these days Blood pressure shot up, too. You need to relax more. Okay, I'll switch to relax mode. E2 to E6, report status. -What is it, Kathir? -Sir! When is the wedding? I don't get it. The entire south block is talking about your love saga! Kathir, If you delay further, I'll do what you did with those flowers, and hand pollinate you both! Can you walk through one more time? That scanner isn't working, Abdul. -Ok -Ask them come through another entry All of you come in through the other entrance. If my leader cannot enter this way, none of us will. Sir, Sir! -Please be patient -Come here! If there's no beep, ones crossing don't know that, right? Check them manually Please come, sir! I'll take care of you after the function! E1 to E6 The lady in the brown dress seems a little out of proportion. Checking, sir. I'm sorry. She's clear.

Ey! [TV] For taking a stand Pakistan for the atrocities they committed they got their revenge on Mr. Varma! Pakistan is definitely behind this act of horror! The careless SPG team is responsible for this. So sad, Mahadevan Sir. Congratulations, next Prime Minister! Thank You, sir. Stop it, I say! Give me a straight answer. I sensed a threat on the PM's side. But I definitely knew there was a bomb near the children Your duty is only to protect the Prime Minister! Our Blue Book of do's and don'ts is our Bible! There is no place for sentiments in our duty. Had you tried, you could've saved the Prime Minister. But you didn't Mr. Kathir. Until this enquiry is complete, you are suspended. [Reporter] The party has convened to decide who will succeed Chandrakanth Varma... Due to a tough contest between two factions within the party ...there's no unanimity among its members of Parliament. Stop everything! Does this seem like a working committee? In this critical situation, the ruling party must not break up The party must not disband, either. The only solution is Abhishek Varma! Doesn't matter who steps up. -Sikander must never take over -True that, sir! [News] A turning point in Indian politics! In Indian history, many people with no political experience have come to power. In the same vein late Prime Minister Chandrakanth Varma's son, Abhishek Varma becomes the next PM. It has caused much joy within the party! This is definitely from Jaish-e-Mohammed. Look at the methods used to activate the bombs See. Manu, but the substance used Anjali's always on the Prime Minister's side. Why did she move away at the time of the blast? Don't look at everything from a cop's perspective. -Hi, Mr.Joseph -Hi, Mr. Manoj How are you? You're Kathiravan, right? What work does a suspended officer have here? How can you come? -I brought him along. -This isn't right. The Prime Minister has been assassinated and an enquiry is ongoing. He cannot come. -It is top secret. -Don't get tensed, sir. He just wants to know how it happened. Why must we tell him that? What authority does he have? You're under investigation, too. Come only when you are summoned. You can leave now. What are you staring at? -What? -Zip! Oh Shit! Don't get tensed. It's zipped up. Rascal! What arrogance! Sir! Sir... Sir! ♪ Million stars, but one sky! ♪ This isn't on the schedule, Anjali!

There could've been future doctors ...Engineers, Farmers ...or even a Prime Minister. Not only that, an assassin who's gonna kill the PM Look up, Joseph, 10'o clock! Pigeons are flocking the sheeted roof Call in the forensics department. Hey, You're either be a coward, or you don't want me to recognize your voice I'm on to you. One day, I'll get you! That day, You'd wish you were dead. Network problem. If we called someone and someone else picks up... ...constantly yaps and doesn't let us get in a word... ...the phone isn't at fault, but the person at the other end is. Get rid of the phone. Idiot. Sir, there's plenty of evidence pointing at the suspect. -We may get a big break. -Very good. Whoever found this place, deserves our appreciation. It was Mr. Kathiravan. Sir... Why are you here? Who asked you to do all this? This is not your job! We were able to find this place only with his Intel. This is our job. We'll handle it. He is a disturbance to the investigation, Mr. Joseph. Ask him to leave! What is this bad smell? -Look down. -What? Don't play with me again Be careful! -Look down from the window -The window? Oh my God! Here, This is the phone used by the killers. -Who are they? -Shut up! I know everything. You don't need to tell me. First leave this place. Get out! What? I told you not to stand here. I know where to stand and where not to. You needn't tell me that. Oh no! Hey...! Stupid pigeons! Now we're 100% successful, Sir! As the chromosome levels of the zygotes have been altered... ...we could separate the male insects from the females. You're right. But... Why do they look drained? We've purposely starved them. Sir, to stop the mining in the Delta district the farmers filed a legal suit in the Supreme Court. The ones who promised to sell them the land are backing out now. They're preparing for a huge protest! We'll use the media to spread word that this protest... ...is carried out by minorities, Naxals and foreign conspirators. Shift focus and curb the problem! -Easy - Sir? -What? If our project began in a dry land like Ramanathapuram... ...farmers will sell us their land willingly. You're right. But Thorium is found only in Thanjavur. So, we can't shift the project from there to Ramanathapuram. Quite difficult. But... ...we must turn Thanjavur into Ramanathapuram. [News] Thanjavur District. -Kathir! Hey, Kathir Wake up, Kathir. Look at the trouble that has come to our land Wake up! [News] that has destroyed many corps in the area Farmers have lost thousands of acres of land to flood and drought. The attacks by these strange insects have caused further damage. Why, dear boy? The fields are good, right? The insects have not made it here yet It must finish up the villages on the way before coming here Here it comes! Looks like a giant hopper. Come! There are much bigger ones, here. Damn it! Turn off the wiper, man! -I said turn off the wiper -Watch your step Hey Durai, what's happening? Hey! Idiot! Mom, are you ok? Can't tell where it came from. You asked, didn't you mom? Here it is! Crops are all ruined! Yes! What do we do now? What the hell, man? It's even falling upon us! Don't be scared. It won't hurt us. Like you didn't scare the wits out of your husband. -I'll skin you, damn it -and you're scared of insects What happened here, Muthiah? Trusting a good harvest, Kamaraj arranged his daughter's wedding. After this happened, he consumed poison He'll be fine. Take him quickly. Move faster, sir. Let's go by the bridge. Who knows what else will happen? Stop! As if this wasn't bad enough Oh God! It's too early to say anything. Give us some time. Only after some research, can we figure out what type of insect this is Please let us do our work. Sorry! Sorry! -What type of hopper is this? -Please don't disturb me. You worked with the Prime Minister, right? -I've seen you on TV. -Yes, sir. I'm Kathir. I also do farming here. I am Satyendran. Entomologist. This kind of hopper is found only in Madagascar, Africa. They come in huge swarms and are called 'locusts'. This is its first attack in India. How do we control this? You spray neem oil as organic pesticide, Yes? Look at the state of your neem trees. They won't budge for anything. It'll die in two or three days and will stop spreading. Won't it breed and lay eggs, sir? It won't spread. What are you saying? We've collected plenty of samples from this town. It's surprising that, there was not a single female insect Sir, What do you mean? Only the male insects hunt. Look at the sub-genital pocula How are they all male insects? That's the million dollar question. We got lucky they were all male insects If there were female insects, they'd lay eggs and it would've been catastrophic! It would've destroyed everything and spread all across Tamil Nadu! What do you say this was called? This species comes under Caelifera gregaria. -Sorry, celi. -Caelifera. Caelifera. -Kathir! -Sir... Have you heard about Caelifera? Caelifera... -Hey! -Worked hard on them Have any sense? -you destroyed everything -What else do you expect? What do I do now? Why did you do this? What are you going to do now? Oh God! You wanted to destroy the insects but you burnt the fields. My lands have been scorched down! I borrowed a lot of money Oh God, wonder what am I going to do? Don't you know that me and our children are here with you? Let go! I'll die, too! Oh no! You dare destitute me and our children? What do I do? It burns! Give it to me! Someone come! Can no one help? Bring some more Go quickly! roll him in to the husk Hold on! Come on move quickly -Take him to the hospital -Go Quickly! Sir! You must be at the PM's office tomorrow morning. It's urgent! Come, Kathir. Abhishek becoming the Prime Minister seems like a dream! Don't get me wrong. Abhi's still a motive-less innocent. When a car breaks down uphill, Abhi's like a random stone that is placed to prevent the car from falling. You gave that kind of boy the post of Prime Minister? Exactly. Doesn't matter if the country doesn't march forward. It mustn't go back! Come, Kathir. Even if you didn't come to congratulate me I hoped you'd come by to console me. Sorry, Abhi. I'm still not out of the shock. You needn't say anything. If you really cared about our people, you would have come. You should've at least begged this man to stop him from making me the PM! Be quiet, Abhi! I'm worried after seeing what's happening around me. I'm worried about your security. Be great if you stayed with Abhi, Kathir. Prepare Kathir's order! I've ordered your suspension to be lifted. Please be with me. From now, you're my Principal Security Adviser. Ok! Vanakkam! How are you? Doesn't matter how we're doing Our nation is in bad shape. Fuel prices are sky high. What will you do about it? Actually... Say that we've asked the state government to reduce the taxes, sir. Mining activities have left farmers in great difficulty. How will you fix that? Tell them we'll explain the benefits of this project to the people. On one side, the Chinese army are infiltrating. How do you respond? How are you qualified to take this job at such a young age? What's your response? It's said Govt. just favors the corporate, what's you response? I'm extremely sorry, sir. -What's this? -Relax, Abhishek. Ignore the prompting. Talk what comes from the heart. How do I reply if you shoot questions like a machine? To be frank, I don't have answers to some questions. And I don't even understand the others. This is neither a monarchy where Humayun and Akbar succeeded Babar nor is it a traditional medicinal practice passed down along generations! Like stopping a car on a slope with a random stone... ...to save the party and the government, I've been lodged into the post of PM. I have no other qualifications besides being over the age of 25. If someone dares you to do something, you will feel the fire to succeed! I had twelve arrears in college My father challenged I'd take five years to clear I ended up clearing it all in one go at the next semester! In the same vein, I learnt Bengali in a week to woo a Bengali girl! What's her name, sir? Did you manage to woo her? Got headlines as well as breaking news, right? I'll make it more interesting. After that, I even learned Malayalam, Punjabi and Gujarati! What language are you learning now, sir? What's your mother tongue? Telugu, sir. Why? I may as well learn that, too. Teach me. Alright, jokes apart. They trusted this seed to flower. Don't dig up the seed every day to see its progress. I'm the seed of Chandrakanth Varma. I will not dry up! Please give me some time. Jai Hind! Welcome, sir. -Hello. Heard from the PM's office that you were coming. Would you like some tea or coffee? No thanks. Have you analyzed all the evidence collected in Kashmir? Has there been any breakthrough? Unfortunately, we didn't get any leads. But we are analyzing them. Who's the analyst? Mr. Ramanajum, he is Mr. Kathiravan. From the Prime Minister's office. We'll take it from here, sir. Thank You. He asked you to leave. -Hello, Mr. Ramanujam. -Hello Heard there was not even a single lead Why? Am I having it but holding back? No matches on fingerprints and DNA. Patiently look through them again. I've been working all night on this. My wife has called seven times. She suspects I'm having an affair. The Aadhar card would point us to them. Are you kidding? 1.35 billion people in this country! We need a large team. Please understand. Even a supercomputer will take days to yield results. How can you expect me to make progress with this junk? May as well tear at my hair. Those in posting now, are retirees. Have you checked agents from IB, RAW, NSG and SPG? True! Why can't it be a black sheep in uniform? Whether they're in uniform or if they're in the nude, can we do this tomorrow? I haven't even bathed yet! Be serious! We're searching for a dangerous criminal. Do it now. We'll wait. My divorce is confirmed! More than who he is, I'm keen to know why he's challenging us That's another million dollar question. -What is that? -I got it! I got it! He's busted! Look at him! Look how accurately his fingerprint matched. Ranjith! Ranjith, Joseph and Me. The three of us worked in Intelligence. Under my leadership, a five member team headed to Pakistan on a secret mission. We blended with the people there using cover identities and surveilled it. The information each of us gathered was exchanged amongst ourselves. That's when we found out about an attack from Pakistan to be carried out in Delhi. We sent all the information about it through Joseph. -Joseph, come with me -But... But we didn't know then that our teammate Ranjith was a double agent. -What are you doing? -Stapler. For money, he sold us out to the ISIS. With that information, Amiz Khan -shot four members of my team. -why do you need a button camera? They revealed nothing and died bravely. -What is your operation? -Indian dog? -What have you planned here? -I was tortured for days I escaped them and wandered undercover around Pakistan for several months. As they got no information about us, the department declared us dead and closed our files. One day, Amiz Khan found out where I was and chased me. I escaped him and reached India. We raided Ranjith's house. In our search, we found evidence in the form of documents that he sold us out. With that, we arrested Ranjith. -Oh no! -Dad! Don't be hasty! On charges of treason, he was sentenced to prison for six years. -Please listen to me! -He went to Tihar Jail. Unable to bear the shame, his wife Sheila and their son killed themselves. After that, there was no news about him. When Joseph investigated him lately, we came to learn he was released three months ago and is lying low, planning these attacks. Enough talk about Ranjith always about bombs, terrorism and violence! Let's do something romantic. Not now. I have work to do. -Get going. -Kathir! Let's go, Kathir. -Where to? -A long drive around Taj Mahal. A walk holding hands. A candlelit dinner. Shopping at Janpath. Can't do all this in one day. Two... Think you can take two days off to do all this? Great. I'll give you a break of two minutes. Quickly finish loving me and go. Is this noodles that can be done in two minutes? -Miser! -I'll whack you! [Reporter] Why this protest, sir? They already mined our land for extracting methane and hydrocarbon and have destroyed our soil and prevented us from farming Corporates companies have destroyed our lives. Now, to extract minerals, a big company is setting up another mine So, they threaten poor farmers and acquire their land. A number of land registrations are set to be done, today. Even if we die... Company officials claim they will buy only from those who agree to sell. In a few villages, a new kind of insect destroyed crops! On seeing that, some people changed their minds. Taking them, the companies will register their land. Look! They've arrived! Let me go! We're fighting for your rights, too! Let live! Let live farming! Do not destroy farming! Do not destroy! Do not destroy farming! You grab our lands unjustly, You will be ruined. You will be ruined! These are the farmers who have agreed to sell their land. Sir, this is Collector speaking Why haven't you registered yet? Thousands of farmers are protesting here! A riot might break out. We don't have enough cops. Difficult to manage. Are the police given weapons just for show? The people are protesting peacefully. If we take action, things might go wrong. If they happen to break or burn something -and if that leads to a riot -I get it. -Mom! -CHARGE! Don't hit us Who sent you to break these? You're not one of us. Why hit us like this? Stop it! Oh no! Don't hit us! Let go! Oh no! Oh God no! Why are you arresting us? You're arresting the wrong people. Why did you spare us? Just shoot us dead right here. Damn! Look! They're attacking the police and setting fire to the police van. There is Maoist infiltration in the Thanjavur district. They go about in guise of paddy farmers, coconut farmers and organic farmers. They are the ones who instigate conflicts over there. Don't pay attention to this. I'll handle it. I'll send the military over and sweep them away. No one would then dream about joining the protest anymore. In just this month, there've been six riots and sixteen dead cops. You'd use the military against our own people? A very Hitler-esque idea. How many people have died in police attacks? That is... -That is what? -What do you mean? I'll take a look, Sir. Tell me, Kathir. 312 people have died. Oh, damn! That many people? Why is this happening? Can we speak openly, sir. Sure. The guises of paddy, coconut and organic farmers are not guises at all. That's their actual livelihood. When there is a threat to their soil they are forced to become fighters. he wears the guise of a revolutionary. If to protest is wrong, creating such a situation is wrong, too! If so, is it fair to destroy government property? Are you saying it's fair for the public to attack cops? These aren't the public, but thugs set up to seem like the public. Look at the footage from all channels. The police crack open citizens' heads. They coldly shoot them like they were pigs. Can't see that in any of the footage. This footage was made to find favor with you. Our cops, provide water to quench thirst. If necessary, can also start a fire. You're a government officer, but speak like a Naxal yourself! Quiet! Ssssh! I asked him to speak up. Was giving mining licenses to agricultural land caused this problem? That's the only issue. They take license in the guise of research or to mine sand but have been extracting Thorium and Uranium and exporting them If you give out licenses to mine a land that has been under cultivation... where'll the farmers turn? Upon losing a livelihood with no guarantee for survival I'm sorry, Sir ...even you and I would take to the streets and protest. Why not shut down those mines that have false claims of being legal? Eight of those mines belong to Mahaan Group of Companies... -...and run by Mahadevan. -It's not so easy. They have legal clearance from excise, export and environmental pollution control. They'll take us to court. Let them! We'll go to the same court Let's see what happens. Santhosh Sir, you do one thing. Give me a detailed report about Mahadev Group of Companies. -Ok? -Sure, Sir. -Hey Kuldeep! -Sir? I'm hungry! Where's the pizza? Just ten minutes, sir. The SPG group is inspecting it. Terrific. It would've dried up and gone cold. -Ya -Mr. Mahadevan has arrived. Did you give him a direct appointment? Ask him to come in. Uncle! Sorry uncle. Forgot you were coming, uncle. No worries. How's the Prime Minister's seat? Very hot. Come, Let's have a drink. Ah...no! I only drink when I'm extremely angry or extremely happy. I'm neither right now. Come on, Uncle. Then why this midnight meeting? Abhi... Heard you had a discussion about shutting down mines in Thanjavur. This is unbelievable. What was discussed in a cabinet meeting this evening, has already reached you your shadow's looming large here I'll find out who your spy is Then your entire Cabinet would be cleaned out That many spies, huh? Isn't farming more vital than mining in Thanjavur's delta district? Definitely not! Whatever is more profitable, is vital. This is an unscheduled meeting. How could it go down without the SPG's knowledge? Those mines are more valuable than diamond mines. You don't understand the value. You're right, Uncle. There's one man who knows the value of farming. He's a farmer from Thanjavur, too. I'll get him. You can talk to him yourself. A farmer from Thanjavur? Why is he a watchman here? He's my Principal Security Adviser. Kathir. Oh, a farmer from Thanjavur, Good! Whatever an acre of land can pay you in fifty years... ...I promised to make a one-time payment of more than that One who rejects that offer and protests in the street is a fool, right? He may or may not be a fool, but whoever's willing to pay a huge sum... ...to buy the land is definitely not a fool. That's the point. The paddy cultivated in the delta district will fetch a measly 1,600 rupees a quintal. But the international price of thorium from the same soil is way higher! If processed right, India can become the largest atomic power in the world. That will be your lifetime achievement. Wow! But every party and organization is against this. Why? We must give them plenty of problems and destroy them. Place a scorpion in the path of those chasing rats they will forgot the rat and chase the scorpion. Now, you throw a snake in their path. As one chases the snake, we can smuggle an elephant under his nose. Awesome, uncle! You may as well sign on to be my adviser. Fine speech indeed. But you're asking me to destroy farming to do this. For the nation to progress, it must have a strong foundation. When digging up a foundation, worms and insects do get displaced. You think farmers to be worms and insects? Land is wealth to you, but is sacred to us. That's why one who works in the field works barefoot. Corporate guys like you run away abroad when you can't repay loans. But no farmer runs away unable to repay loans. He has dignity. He'd rather die! They are dying! In the last ten years, two lakh farmers have committed suicide. Why work so hard at farming? All they need is some damn grains, right? I'll import plenty of grains from Karnataka, Orissa, Vietnam and Thailand! We must make India a superpower, Abhi! I'll make you a super PM. Farmers it seems To make India a superpower, you'll turn Tamil Nadu a desert? Come on, Abhi. Even Dubai is a desert but isn't it raining money there? One of the richest places on Earth. No government will entertain such a nasty thought that'll destroy ...Tamil Nadu's heritage and culture. Abhi! Let me tell you a story I had a copper factory in Ethiopia. Five years ago, there was a change in the Government... ...and they shut down my factory, claiming environmental issues. I spent just only twenty million dollars on it. Just spent $20 million! A militant group there came into power in just three weeks... ...and hanged the previous President. Now, I have fourteen copper factories in that country. I seem to get what he's trying to say, yet don't get it at all. If you shut down his mines, he'll topple your administration. Oh, uncle! I'm asking you to not push me that far. You're right. If I personally close your mines, it's a prestige issue. Let's do this. Let's have a grand function in Thanjavur next month. You personally announce the closure of the mines, for the good of the people. I'll garland and felicitate you. It'll be great. You can even contest in the election and join the Parliament. Why must I become a member of Parliament? The 60 MPs in your party will listen to me. Why won't you alone not do so? So if I don't listen, you'll topple my government? It's good for you if you listen. Mr. PA. All illegal mines have to be banned, our legal options must be discussed. Have the Attorney General come in tomorrow. Abhi! You don't know whom to befriend or antagonize. You'll learn. You're extremely angry now, uncle. Like you said, you need a shot. -Gulp it down! -Stop it. You're Chandrakanth Varma's son. That's merely who you are. Chandrakanth is no more. You must realize that, Abhi. Even you must realize that this is India. Not Ethiopia. Mr.Mahadev! Boys! You're messing with the wrong man. This is wrong, Abhi. Don't violate protocol and give personalized appointments over the phone again. -It's okay, Kathir, let's have a drink. -No, Abhi. The Prime Minister's almost here. Done with bug checking. Only the table's left. Hey Kathir! -Hi! -Hi... Is there a ritual at the Mariamman temple nearby? You'll get whacked! -What? -Thought you'd call and wish me in the morning but you failed me. At least now, try to remember. Is a prospective groom coming to visit? What? Happy Birthday to you, Anjali! -Happy Birthday! -Thank you. Did you forget, Kathir? Be sincere in love, like you are with duty, bro. He can't even remember my birthday! What kind of love is this? This won't do! Grab him by his shirt Punch him twice! -You deserve this, Kathir! -Thanks, sir. I even said there is a party at the resort. How could you forget? I knew there was a party. -Didn't know when. -A party? What time? You didn't invite me? -What time? -At 8 PM. I'll join you when you go, Kathir. Sir, no way! If you're coming, I have plenty of security measures to be taken I must scrutinize every guest who passes by each entrance. Kitchen and food must be checked. Many formalities and protocols. You can't just do this on a whim. If I had a heart attack on a whim, will you grab me and run, or follow protocol? That'd be an emergency. This is a birthday party. What crap protocol! Damn with the protocols. Hey, buddy! Let honey flow with kisses and whiskey I'm Santiago! Never ever let me go Come with me, loved one. You are my sweet heart. The moment you see me, is ecstasy Dance with me, O dancing queen You're one with my breath My desire! There's the wine in your eyes. Come, my treasure have I come to steal you? O Golden Savannah Are you the sandalwood bed? You eyes are deep as the Atlantic and long as the Arabian sea, O birdie A shake of your hips will suffice to get my heart spinning All my directions change, my Queen Your roaming eyes linger in my heart The moon stands no chance to those eyes You're the eighth wonder of the world! It's strange that my wisdom is being destroyed! Innumerable, are they men you kill! Your beauty is a battlefield! There's no pleasure when you just look Take my in your hands Don't spin poems with your lies Give me pleasure and pain My feminity will never be satisfied with your empty words Strangle my beauty until the heat is gone My life won't be sweet until you break me Without your violence, my night is incomplete Our eyes meeting won't suffice My lust won't be quelled until our hands twine together If you want sugar, sugarcane must be crushed It's unacceptable if you walk away My lusty aura won't let you go, Drown in it I forbid you! My twin flowers won't be spoilt It won't let you go away Come touch me with your many hands What are you doing? Why did you do this? why did you bring Abhi? What am I supposed to do? He won't listen He asked if I'd rather take him or he snuck out himself -Such a goof up -I had no choice. Come Anjali, I want to show you something. Anjali, I have a surprise for you. Surprise? That beauty is for you! Wow! Come, come. Watch it, Vivek. 100 kilometers in five seconds. Four wheel drive! And it is powerful! -But I really can't... -No! It has a lot more, Get in! Let's not alert the traffic control. Joseph will be in car one. We will be taking Rajaji Marg Kitten will be in Car 3, no stopping anywhere. -Prem, I want you to be in the last car -I have an idea I will be in contact with Joseph -Alert! Guys he's moving -Come on! -Follow him! -Move out now. Fast! Come on! Get in! The lamb has come out alone. What should I do? No! Abhi careful, slowdown. Pick up! Pick up! Take left! Go! Please, That's enough! The SPG will have a meltdown, Don't do it. I'm fed up with them. Always telling me what and what not to do. Let them suffer for a while. Tonight is my night! Send some large vehicle It's a prostitution case. Don't tear the house apart. Let's talk it out. Screw you! I'll make sure to press charges on you, this time. Like hell you will. The car itself is probably drunk! Hey, Stop! Stop! Stop! Get down! Please don't get down, Abhi. Security! Rather than standing guard in my house, why are you standing here? Had I not braked in time, you'd have been a goner. He's drunk, sir! Who is this new security guard? You needn't blow. -I am a cop. -Sorry, cop! -I love you, Police -don't hug me What the hell did you drink? Sex on the Beach. That too, huh? Delhi has no beach. That's the name of the cocktail! Don't talk about cock and tail to me. I've never seen you at our union. You charge by the hour or per night? Damn it, get lost! -Move aside -Police, please Do you know who he is? I was wondering why this line hadn't come up yet. Is he this area councilor? No Is this the sex on the beach you mentioned? She's Kathir's girlfriend, sir. What? You're flirting it out with another man's girlfriend? -You go! -Come, dear. Don't get worked up If you pay up 200 bucks, he'll let you off! A bribe? Yes, man! You're asking for a bribe? When did I ask you for a bribe? You won't tell me who you are -My plans are ruined -Are you alright, sir? Please let's go. Hold on! He was driving drunk, I'm interrogating him You can't just waltz in and take him away -Hold on, officer. I'll explain. -Sir, wait! I'm an Inspector. You dare put your hands on me? Do you know what he did? Answer me, come on. They're just bluffing. Don't believe them. Come. -Sir, please come -I'm extremely sorry, sir. -He's accepted it. -It is not alright. What I did was wrong. I drank and drove. Filing a case is the right thing to do I spoke without knowing who you are. -Please don't transfer me to jungle -you do your duty -Move aside! -Prepare a charge sheet Please come with me, sir. -What is this, Kathir? -Please walk with me. I tried to have one night of fun... -Just be there! -All is lost! Down Abhi, down This way! -Anjali -Hey! Secure Kitten. I need a gun! Cover me from that side Move, Abhi! Stay close! Sir, stay low. Stay low! Anjali! Anjali. Anjali. Head inside -Anjali, Anjali -Don't come out here, get inside Get inside, stay here. Anjali's on the ground Oh, no! They shot her down. Lift her properly! Careful! Anjali! Shut the door. Come. Damn it. Cover me, Vivek I need more, come on. Abhi duck down. Down! Take cover, Abhi! Move! Abhi duck, stay low! Vivek, Mag! Hey, Kathir! Damn it! Ranjith?! Abhi's alone, you go with him. Get to the street behind Bring him over, Vivek. Vicky, secure another way for him. Yes, sir! Come! Cover him! Hey, Ranjith! -Are you okay, Abhi? -He's alright. We need a vehicle. -Any covered one will do -I'll find one, Sir. Give me your vehicle, sir. It's an emergency. Who are you? Stop the vehicle! -Come fast, Kathir. -Don't stop, keep moving. -Don't stop the vehicle -Move faster -Get on it -Keep moving, don't stop. Joseph! Come on, Joseph! Give me your hand! Give me your hand! Get in! Joseph! No! Hey! Come on... Shit! Head to the hospital, Vivek. Listen to me, You'll be fine. Don't close your eyes! We'll reach there quickly. Go fast! Priya'll be there. I'll get her to the hospital! Speed up the vehicle! You'll be fine. You relax, calm down. Don't close your eyes. Just a little longer. You must be brave now. Please don't give up, Joseph. Please don't. Joseph! What happened, Kathir? He's dead! He's dead for good. How many times did I warn you? Did you ever listen? When enemies fire, even cops and military first take cover. Only then, do they shoot! But when we hear gunshots, we step up right away and take a bullet to our hearts. That's our duty! The unwritten law of SPG! He's dead due to your irresponsible behavior. -No, Kathir. -Don't talk! You move around freely because of sincere officers like Joseph. People get paid for their work. But we get paid to die! One can die but it must not be meaningless like this. My only friend. I'm sorry, Kathir. Hello, Anjali. -Hello -Hello How is she doing, doctor. Good, overall, she's fine. We've implanted a titanium plate. She can go back to work tomorrow. Nothing to worry. She'll recover soon. Thank you, Doctor. -Don't worry. -Priya's come to the mortuary. -I'll be back. -you can discharge her in the evening Madam, sign please. Prem! Why did you do this, man? Damn traitor! What more? You man got caught He's tied up. Hurry. He might spill the beans! Joseph figured out that I worked for Ranjith. If Joseph told you that, I'd be finished! I had no choice. If the post-mortem report notices the bullet, it'll lead back to me. Who told you to do this? Please, No! You know... I'll shove you in a box along with these corpses and go about my day -No, Kathir! -Tell me, where's Ranjith? Will you tell me or not? Don't do anything to me! I'll tell you! Attorney General, Sir. Mahadev can gladly take this to the Supreme Court. We need to ban all his mines. You know the power of police blows, right? They strike hard! It leaves no external mark. But every spare part within is left in shambles. Kathir! Look at this, Mr. Varma This insect is called Caelifera. An insect species that causes mayhem in African nations. When they come in swarms, they are called locusts. Very dangerous! When we were studying these insects in our agricultural lab we discovered they'd be a more effective weapon than a missile. Are you suggesting a bio-war? You can call it entomological warfare. We'll starve these insects and sneak them onto the freight trains to Pakistan If released during the harvest cycle, in just a week they'll destroy the entire crops of wheat. If we repeat this for three harvest cycles, their entire agriculture will be wiped out. It'll lead to food shortage and unemployment. Their economy will plummet and they'll have to take alms from us. Do insects know border lines? What if they return and attack our crops? We'll segregate male and female insects and send out only the males. The lifespan of this insect is only one week. If we send out both male and female insects, they'll breed and multiply to become an indestructible force like mosquitoes and cockroaches. But we needn't do that, now. What do you have, Mr. Mahadev? No, I'm good. I don't mean, now. What do you have every day? Rice. Like everyone else. Or it's scraps that pigs eat? To distract people's attention from the corruption and ills of the nation Pakistan always wields a weapon: threat from India. It's the same case with our country too This is a nasty political game played even in our country, to stir up hatred in people! What did the people of Pakistan do to deserve this? You propose a plan to destroy their living You're like a vulture that preys on corpses. Merchant of Death! If Pakistan paid you, you wouldn't hesitate... ...to release these insects in India! illegal supply of chemical weapons to other countries by you the CBI has been covertly probing your companies Your Mahan Group of companies are involved in license violation tax evasion and other economic crimes do you think I'm unaware of everything? You're being watched 24/7! You know the government's getting ready to take action against you. Isn't that why you tried assassinating me at DD Function and London Conference But your days are numbered, Mahadev. -You may leave. -You'll realize who I am, Mr. Varma. Must I tell you separately? Some Defense Minister you are! Brokering deals, are you? Get out! Hi, Kathir! Welcome! No one's around to even offer coffee Had my wife been around, she would've done that She hanged herself because of you You think you are avenging, but you're making a mistake. Hey Kathir, You dragged me away naked Must I not make you endure at least a part of that humiliation? That's why I hide and watch as you race around. But you've so diligently kept a record of all your crimes. Which hole will you hide under? Alexa! What is a remote wipe? Remote Wipe: It's a security feature that allows a network administrator or a device owner to send a command to a computer device to delete data. What remote wipe accomplishes can depend on the device it's specific operating system version or any 3rd party mobile device management Think you can make away with these hard disks? Alexa, what does IED mean? It is an improvised explosive device. A bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. Homes and offices, they've bugged eight places in all. Get ready to arrest Mahadev right away. Hold on, Sir The room, Ranjith's computer and the drives that Kathir copied have all been destroyed in fire. How can we arrest him without any evidence? Give me the gun. I'll shoot him, without leaving evidence. Bastard! Laying hands on him, will derail the Indian economy. The share market, GDP, employment, foreign exchange... Hell, even our currency value will nosedive Then why the hell do I need this office? It's him who's ruling this nation. I am mere puppet on a string? We promptly arrest protestors, bystanders, tramps at train stations... ...schmucks in tea stalls and helmet less bike riders. You want us to stand by and watch actual criminals and traitors get away? If the economy will take a dive if we arrest Mahadev, so be it! We have the strength to bounce back. You don't need cause to arrest Mahadev. You only need guts. Mahaan Corporation, a major contributor to the Indian economy Several raids have been ordered by the government. From these investigations, the Mahaan family has indulged in several unlawful activities. plenty of evidence has been gathered -Please stop the work -we are informed. -Anthony! Collect all the mobile phones. -Through forged documents, agricultural and forest lands have been converted into industrial lands. These raids have dealt a major blow to the Mahaan Group that's already facing plenty of allegations. their stock which has been dominating the market, dropped sharply Mahadev's auditor are co-operating with us. Like a hole in a sinking ship. -But economically... -Mr. Mahadev is on the line. Abhi... Abhishek Chandrakanth Varma. You shouldn't have killed my father. You made a big mistake. I understand your anger. But I'm innocent. Someone is misguiding you. If you're really innocent, -why make this phone call? -Let's finish it, Abhi. I have eight mines in Thanjavur, with legal permits. I can dig in. Yet, I concede. Like you wished, you can announce that they'd be shut down. Prepare for the event. Your image will skyrocket! In return... Stop these raids. Tell me what to do. I'll call back. Why make this compromise? The arrow moves back before darting forward -I don't get it. -Caelifera! This time, I'm going to unleash both male and female insects. Before they know it, it'll multiply by the millions It won't spare a single farmer in the Thanjavur district. Total damage! -Sir -What? Have you reached? I'll be there in an hour. If there's a problem on the way, let them out immediately. Alright, sir. Good to go. Someone's atop the tanker. Shoot him! Yes, Sir. Go check the roof! Time left? Just one minute left to hit the tunnel The length of the train and the tunnel are the same. Do it here! The train's entered the tunnel. Only twenty seconds until the entire train passes through. Invite everyone as mentioned in the agenda. Relay CAM 6. Zoom on him. -Is everything alright, Karna? -Yes, Vivek. Don't just check the bearded men coming to the event Be it clean-shaven men or bald men, no exceptions. Check everyone! -Ok? -Ok, Vivek. Be careful. B-3 coming! His face looks smudged, zoom in on him You keep tracking him. Hey! What about the raid that went down in your company? Later, later, will discuss after the event Vanakkam, Sir. Sir, Sir, Sir... Look at this! After bowing so much, they seem to be permanently hunched. Your visit makes Tamil Nadu proud. How are you, Abhishek Chandrakanth Varma? By your grace, I'm well. Nice. Please sit. -Vanakkam! -Vanakkam, Sir. I invite the Honorable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to give the welcome address. What an actor, man! You craftily knocked off my father... ...then put on a great performance at his wake. You deserve an Oscar! Have you forgotten, Abhi you claimed your dad didn't want you in politics? Weren't you the one who asked me to get rid of him? Mr. Varma was a God to me. So I refused. You had someone else do the job, became the Prime Minister, and now falsely accuse me of the crime. Even if they arrest you, that's the story you'll stick with. Criminal mastermind, you are. There can be no two thoughts about it. Thank You, everyone. Vanakkam! We invite industrialist Mahadev onto the stage. Greetings, everyone. There were raids conducted on my company's factories and offices in India. Through these raids, The Prime Minister has given us a certificate Unknown to me, there were bad folks in my company. He has pointed them out. I must thank him for that. Come in, Karna! Why's the jammer turned off? What's going on? -Karna, do you copy? -Sorry, Sir Sorry, sir. It got turned off by mistake. Turning it back on. SPG frequency. Thanks. Mr. Vivek's in the control room. Can't communicate with him. Continuously no reply Control room!? Control room! Vivek Vivek! Kathir, here! Come in. Come in, Vivek. Stay alert. What did you do to Vivek? Tell me! What is your plan? What is your plan?! Where is Vivek? Tell me where he is! I'll tell you My men took him away. I told them to kill him. What's their phone number? Call them! My phone! There's no signal. -What's the number? -The jammers are on. Tell me the number. 00? Hey, hey...no, no. Stop! Stop! Don't call! -Why not? -Don't call Tell me why! He'll die! Your Prime Minister will die Where's the bomb on the stage? I called when Anjali was talking to the Prime Minister. You didn't panic then... But when Mahadev sat near PM, you stopped me Tell me the truth. Tell me Where's the bomb? Tell me, where's the bomb? Bomb is with Anjali. If you call this number, it'll explode. I invite our Honorable Prime Minister, Abhishek Varma to deliver the keynote speech. Come in, B-3. B-1 to B-3. Check what's inside Anjali's bag. Bring her to the control room right away. Why are you checking my bag? Hello?! The Prime Minister's giving a speech in there, I have to be there. Can you hear me? You keep taking stuff from my bag Kiran, where are you? From today, I declare the Cauvery delta region... ...to be a protected agricultural land. Here on, there will be only farming there. No digging up for anything else. To do good without any fear... What's happening, Kathir? They claim to have orders from you to arrest me. Sorry, ma'am. Your act is of no use. Under gunpoint, I had no other choice. I told them everything. Who are you? What are you blabbing? We've checked her bag entirely! Besides papers, there's nothing else there. No explosives. Anjali has the bomb in her hand! No farmer should commit suicide moving forward... That's the reason it is damaged. A titanium plate has also been fixed. more than gaining numbers on sensex a Farmer is no less than a Rocket Scientist it's imperative to save the border Would people join suicide squads, only for the sake of religion or community? They can do so for revenge, too. Don't you get it? Varma mindlessly let her father die To avenge that, she has become a human bomb Bullshit, Kathir. Please don't believe him. Please! In Kashmir, Anjali was with Varma all along. She moved away from him shortly before the bomb killed him. Didn't you notice that, Kathir? Revenge is a stronger emotion than anything else. No! Shall I call the police, sir? No! I don't believe in letting the court pass sentence on you both. So, you both can die right here, right now. Hey! Hey! What was that number again? Uh...No! 9... No! No, Kathir! -00 -Don't Kathir, it'll explode. Don't move! Stay right next to her. Stay back! No, Stop it! No, Don't make the call! -7 -Don't do it, Kathir! I lied! She is innocent. Anjali had nothing to do with this. Switch off the phone. Switch it off I bought out the doctor who performed surgery on her... ...and implanted a bomb in her hand without her knowledge. Switch off the phone! Listen to me, Kathir! Damn you... Think you're the only one who can play this game? Sorry, Anjali. She meets the Prime Minister several times a day. Had she wanted to, she could've killed him any time. Would she plant a bomb on herself and give the controls to you? Won't you even speak an iota of truth? That bomb has already been deactivated. We can do a surgery and remove the implanted bomb. Take her to the hospital right away. -Yes, sir. -You'll be alright. Come with me, ma'am. Are you alright, Vivek? -Are you alright, Vivek? -Yes. The first step towards saving the delta region... ...is to immediately shut down all mines of the Mahaan Group. Agriculture and science will be the two eyes of my government. Thank you! Jai Hind! Said I won't speak an iota of truth, huh? Shall I do it now? The plan A failed there's Plan B, It won't miss. Before your Prime Minister reaches his car, he'll be dead! Hey, Tell me! What is Plan B? You showed me the fear of death, Kathir. But now that fear is gone. Every second you stay here, the PM's life slips away! Come on! Shoot me! Save the PM if you can. Kathir, you leave -Go to the PM, I'll take care of him -Save him if you can Don't allow him. What? A train blast? How did it happen? Bloody idiots! Hurry up! You? What the hell are you doing here? What happened to the train? You didn't do crap! What the hell are you guys doing? Is this why I paid you a fortune? As you wished, the PM will die in agony right before your eyes. Come on! Hurry up! Hey, Kathir! Figured where the second bomb is? Why go around in circles? You are the bomb! Stop your bloody stupid games. What happened, Kathir? Hey...stop it! If you remove the jacket or even move a step, I'll hit the switch! You're going to die, Kathir! You must die knowing you failed! No! Down! Pilot, move! Get inside! Move now! What's happening, Kathir? -What's the dog doing? -We need to check your jacket. What? Wait. It's like your father said. Only if one life is sacrificed, can a hundred be saved It's not wrong. Just so happened to be two lives, this time. Expected you to take me to the Caribbean islands for the honeymoon. Instead, you brought me to this sugarcane field. Doesn't matter where we are. What matters is with whom we are. But, you're not with me. Your mind is someplace else. Yes, I was wondering if the field has been watered Don't know if the cattle feed has arrived. Why? Does it have a new passport and a gun? A new assignment? When there's such a beauty next to you, you talk about cattle feed? A beauty? Where? All I see is a beast!
