I knew that! I'm having a heart attack. Drop the revolver. Get down and throw us a mailbag. Everybody out, move. And come out with your hands over your head. Poïme. This is bad, shooting at innocent passengers. - You will flee from the law. - Really? Now I'm the law here and I order you to close your mouth and go there, let's go. Check him out for something worthwhile. No, please don't take my pills, I can't live without them. I'll make sure it hangs for it! Honey, everything is under control, you can end the acting. Beautiful. Hide them. Get your hands off me! - What should I do? - All right. This road has a pothole, I'll see you in Clifton tomorrow. It will be a walk to San Francisco from there. Now get back in the car and continue the comedy. - Yes. - Let's go. Choï. All right, you two get down. You can leave. Goodbye, ma'am, I apologize for the inconvenience. The exit is here, and I recommend you go in that direction. Did you hear him laugh? So only a nasty killer can laugh. The horses are tired and so are we. We will have to find some solution. - You're always an opitmist. - You certainly don't see what I do. - What do you think? - What are we waiting for? These horses want ours. Take the saddles, don't wait. - Father, the stagecoach has just arrived. - All right, Nancy. - Is my surprise coming? - Well, I don't know, I hope so. I'm sorry, sir. Hey, Nancy, you can't just get to the captain's office. I know he's a captain, but he's my father, too. If Miss... ma'am, well, I don't know what I'm saying. - Come on, Nancy. - Go with Sergeant Macintosh, honey. I have to keep working. Come on, sergeant, my father has a job. Fort Marcy, you can get off. Food and drink can be found in the bar. I don't want food! I want a doctor, I need a doctor. I can't help you. It's a fortress cavalry, and the only doctor here is a veterinarian. - How long until I leave? - It depends on Captain Dempster, he commands. You come with a three-hour delay, did you have tea with the idnians? - Captain, they robbed us. - What are you saying? They killed McGriff, they were three, we can't identify them, they had scarves. But the boss had a characteristic laugh. - It amused him all. - It hurts three. - What were you transporting? Honey? - No, just mail. Now that you're talking, they seem to be looking for something in the mail, the tall man rummaged in it until he found the package he was looking for. And they killed McGriff. It must be Bob's gang. But Bob's gang never fell so west. Because they have a shelter in Texas. They think that attacks on the stagecoach will be easier in the west. - Alright. - Captain, there's nothing to do. All right, Matt, rest. We're going to chase Bob's gang. No one will plunder this territory. - I hope I'm not interrupting. - What can I...? I'm sorry. Captain Dempster, this is Mrs. Larkin, one of my passengers. Captain. Do I have to get to San Francisco when we leave? I'm sorry, but the delay is delayed, you have to stay here for a few days. But I don't want to stay, I'd rather leave if possible. I understand, but... You will have to wait until the escort arrives. - And when it will be? - I don't know right now. Captain, I insist on leaving immediately. The sleigh will keep calm, miss, not just what you want. I have to take care of other things, they killed a man. The cat will let you know when you can leave. I thought you were an officer and a gentleman. I am the commander of Fort Marcy, gentlemen can be found in San Francisco. I think that's clear. No, miss? Don't worry, I'll have the last word. Not if you plan to give orders to the man in charge. You seem to know him well, how do you think i should go about it? Delicate, feminine charm. Lieutenant Morgan at your service, sir. Lieutenant, I have a federal circular about Bob's gang. I have the impression that they were the ones who attacked the stagecoach. The problem is, we don't know their faces, sir. Do you want a photo? Start from scratch. - It could be any man. - Exactly, crossbar, we must follow the instinct. - Find and catch. - Yes sir. Koèiš said they went to the Chandelier Mountains, - You're going to examine it. - Very well, sir. - Don't come back without them. - Yes sir. Wait, Lieutenant. - Take an Indian hitchhiker, it can be useful, he knows the terrain. - Yes sir. Why did you join the cavalry? I do not understand, - You don't know anything about cats. - Look, Sergeant, that's a long story. Especially in my case. Sergeant, get your men ready. Complete equipment, benefits for three days, we leave immediately. Yes sir. All right, everyone, you heard the lieutenant. Move, get everything ready! - When are we going? - When the captain says. I think I'll have to help him. Yes, but don't forget the delicate, feminine charm. Come on. Mrs. Larkin wants to see you. - Let him in. - Yes sir. - Captain Dempster. - I'm listening. I want to apologize for my position before I think it's a long way and what happened was the reason I'm sorry. That's fine. When do you think we can go, sir? It depends on the circumstances. Koèiš said that he was willing to go unaccompanied, - But you ordered him to wait. - Yes, it is. - You seem in a hurry. - Yes, yes, Captain. You know, my grandmother is very sick, I wouldn't forgive myself if I came late. - I'm sorry. - Let us go, please. - If I don't... - Thank you, Captain, don't forget that. Goodbye, Captain. I see that you are ready to go, what prompted you to make an earthly decision? Yes, she convinced me, and imagine, she managed to convince the captain as well. Forward! - Are you scared? - Who? Me and fear? I think you said you were the greatest Idnian fighter east of Rio Grande. It was east of the Rio Grande, west of the Rio Grande I am no longer a warrior with the Indians. - I hope you're okay. - Yes, thank you and your men. Ready! I'd like to thank you again, Lieutenant... No, don't thank us. Thank the bandits for robbing you in the morning. If our path didn't go west, we wouldn't have arrived on time. Does that mean you didn't catch them? We could have done it, but you got rid of us. I'm sorry, but why me? You're the reason we're late, I doubt we can catch them. It seems to be the only requirement for a US cavalry officer is rude and now make sure I can continue on my way. If you don't mind, return your car to Marcy's fortress. - These idnians won't scare me. - Don't try your luck. - We're ready, sir. - All right, Sergeant, - back to the fortress. - Cavalry forward! Lieutenant, almost back? All right. Save yourself compliments, Captain, I must say we have not completed the mission. And why are you back? I gave orders. - I had no choice, sir. - How is that? I was looking for exiles, when we came across a group of navajas attacking a stagecoach. Navajo? Their chief and I have been friends for a long time. Are you sure they were Navajo? - Sure. - Are they victims? We lost the cat. Lieutenant, I don't understand since I came to the fort one of the few things I achieved was peace of mind. We have had an agreement with them for years. - Not anymore. - I do not believe that. They wouldn't attack without a good reason, I'm sure. The Indians on the war side need no reason. Where did you find out? In books? No, sir, on the road of death. This is a lesson. This is what needs to be done with navajo. This situation needs diplomacy, not shooting. This situation needs diplomacy, not shooting. Poïme. Poïme. I'm sorry, sir, Mrs. Larkin wants to see you. I'm sorry, sir, Miss Larkin wants to see you. - Captain Dempster, please... - Captain Dempster doesn't want - Captain Dempster, please... - Captain Dempster doesn't want if he hadn't listened to you, the cat would still be alive. if he hadn't listened to you, the cat would still be alive. You will be in the fortress until further notice. You will be in the fortress until further notice. How dare you? How dare you? By what right do you command me? By what right do you command me? By what right? The right of Congress. By what right? The right of Congress. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Incredible temperament. Incredible temperament. Why don't you look where...? - I'm sorry. I hurt you? - Not. And me to you? No, of course not. Do you know where the women's hostel is? - Come on, I'll show you. - Thank you. - What is your me? - Nancy Dempster. I'm the daughter of the commander in charge here. - Really? - And your name? Lorabelle, Lorabelle Larkin. I like the name, it's beautiful. But you can call me Lorabelle. Thanks, and you're me, Nancy. Thank you. Well, here we are. Who dresses so rarely. Do all women wear dresses so beautiful? Well, only those who can afford it. - You're beautiful in that dress. - Thank you, Nancy. You have a beautiful doll. It's a gift from the Navajo chief, a gift when my father and he signed a truce. Then you should have her for a long time. That's a nice portrait. Do you see it? Surely, when you grow up safe, you will be a lot of beautiful things to me. - Mrs. Larkin? - Yes. - I'm Susan Wilson, a teacher. - Nice to meet you. I hope you don't mind sharing a room with me, - It will take longer. - Not at all. Can I do something for you to make it more comfortable? No, thanks. Nancy was a great help. Nancy, you need to go to school. - Goodbye, Lorabelle. - Come on. Well, you're already a veteran. Does that mean I would stop being stupid? No, now you have tasted blood and sweat and fought the Indians. Now you can look someone in the eye and say: Here's a US cavalry soldier. I bet it was a tough battle with the Indians. heavy? It was a toy. Do you think it was even heavier? Sure, I remember when I was at the Seventh Cavalry in Kansas, we fought against the Czechs, I remember a big battle, I don't know how it happened, but suddenly I was alone, All alone, I stabbed my horse and tried to get to the regiment in front of me were 50 Indians, they turned and blew the trumpet; a hundred idnians wanted to cut me off, and 200 Indians crept up to me from the left. So I turned right and there were 300 Indians. All around me, the Indians here, the Indians in front, the Indians behind me, the Indians on the left, - Indians on the right. - What happened? What happened? They killed me. If they killed you, why are you still alive? Do you think this is life? - Sergeant Macintosh. - Yes sir. Compensate for losses and prepare the regiment, we set out back. All right, sir. Soldiers put it! Stop! Zosada! Chief White Eagle, I come here with a heavy heart. For many months, your tribe and my people lived in peace. Why did you break your contract? That's not true, whites violated the treaty. My people want peace, but whites kill warriors and steal horses. They broke the contract, the Navajo want revenge. Do you want revenge on the innocent? The white man also kills innocent navajos. White Eagle, I am sad that there has been an injustice against the blood brothers. But there will be justice, no one has the right to break the law, white shaking white. When a white man killed an Indian, the Indian would be punished by the Navajo Law. The government respects the Navajo and their laws, we will do everything in our power to catch those whites and pay for these crimes, please tell your men and let us continue to live in peace. No peace until you find the culprits and hand them over to me. My captain is demanding a truce. Tell your commander we're waiting for the sun to set twice. But if he does not give me the culprits, I will gather the tribes and there will be war Don't start another war, White Eagle, new killings will lead nowhere, a peaceful solution must be found. The Navajo want to live for another life. - Can I help you? - When will the stagecoach arrive? You know, sir, he should be here in a few minutes, but... he's not coming. - Are you kidding, old man? - No, I'm not kidding. There was an uprising and there will be no stagecoach, at least until the soldiers suppress the uprising. - And how long will it take? - I do not know, maybe a few days, maybe weeks... Who knows? Maybe a few months. It depends on the circumstances. What are the circumstances, Grandpa? Well, it depends on what the Indians want, and also depends - What are we willing to give them? - Thanks for the help. Now we know less than I started asking. It's okay, son. If you want to do something else, I am willing to help. Where can we find something to drink here? Take that path to the end, there you will find a saloon, they have good whiskey. - I'm thirsty. - Let's go. Wait, it's not worth walking. It is closed. I know it. Well, what do we do now? Back to Fortress Marcy, they pick up Lorabelle with the diamonds. Are you out of your mind? If they see the three of us together, they will realize who we are. He is right. I won't risk my neck. What about Lorabelle? We can't take her alone in the fortress. Diamonds will keep her company, they will alleviate her loneliness. It can make you nervous. Having those diamonds in a military zone can be dangerous. - We have to get her out. - You have to get her out, not us, she's your girl. Okay, I'll go, you really don't have to come with me. No, you won't go when you're safe with the loot, we won't see you again. Why do you think that? Because I would do it in your place. Wait. I think you should go to the fort to take Lorabelle, we will be and escort to Elephant Rock and wait there. And if you can't get enough? Manage to. All right, let's go. Zosada! - Take down the guard. - Father! - Nancy! - Father! Sir, will I cancel the social party on Saturday? Don't interrupt social entertainment, Dad, please. Certainly not, Nancy wouldn't forgive me. - But the White Eagle... - The Navajo don't attack at night. Yes sir. Stop! Guards! Yes sir. I'm going west and I want to spend the night here. Follow me. Sir, this man wants to spend the night here. Yes? My name is Murray, I'm a cattle ranch and I'm going to Arizona. Cows in Arizona? I heard there are very good pastures. - Perhaps. - I'll move on in the morning. I think you should think to stay longer, there was a war with the Navajo. All civilians are trapped in the fortress until the end. I'm glad I came in full. Yes, I think so. London Bridge will fall, it will fall, it will fall. The London Bridge will fall, fallen. London Bridge will fall, it will fall, it will fall. - Nancy, come to my place, will you? - Let's start again. Ready? Poïme. You must be crazy to come here. - Aren't you glad to see me? - Not under these circumstances. I risked coming for you and you are afraid of me like the devil of the cross. You're sick of looking for me. Do you want them to hang? Why would the military hang a decent rancher like me? Until things are resolved with navajos, I'm a guest. You have more courage than reason. Maybe that's why I'm crazy about you. - Where are Chief and Levering? - They're waiting on Elephant Rock. - Do you have diamonds? - Yes. - All right, we'll leave when it gets dark. - How? Calm down, I'll find a way. - Hello, boys. - Hello. Sing us a song. - Yes, sing. - Sing. - Bring me a guitar. - I'm coming. Come closer. Come on, kids, come on. Dad, I'm in a hurry for you. I am beautiful? Very good. Why aren't you turned on? I've grown since it was sewn. If you grow so fast, it will be good for the stagecoach to bring new ones. I want them on Saturday. - Can you adjust them? - All right... I think I have to push the button. Tell me a story. You know, there was once a brave soldier. - What was his rank? - What? What was his rank? No... I think he was a soldier first. One day, he put on his armor and put on his horse. - It was cavalry. - Yes. - And he had a wife? - Of course. - What was her name? - Ro... Roanoke. Dad, it's a city. Yes. I got it, Mrs. Rowener. Captain, can I talk to you for a second? Not. I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain, the sergeant wanted to say I wanted to see you. - Hello, Lorabelle. - What's going on? Well, I just wanted you to know that I understand perfectly... Dad knows what he's doing, eyes? Thanks, Nancy. - It's that I'm looking forward to... - Father knows. - Sergeant! - Yes sir. - Don't stand there and come here. - Yes sir. - What should I do, sir? - Come on. Well... I don't sew, I only understand rifles, sir. No need to shout, Mrs. Larkin, I've spent a lot of time with horses. I understand. Do you think that the problems with the Indians will be solved? The truth is, I don't know, it looks serious. The White Eagle threat still persists for the three outlaws. I'm sorry, - I think yes. - I hope you're comfortable. - Yes it is, the truth is, susan is very kind to me. Please excuse me. Stop laughing. I'm not laughing, I'm shaking, you stabbed me. Pichol? You're lying. - Can I help you, Sergeant? - Of course, ma'am, I can handle a rifle much better than a needle. - I'm building two. - I accept your bet. And I. I'm raising. - Me too. - What do you have? - Not. - Not. Not. Queen? - How much? - One. I thought it was a bluff. I don't understand, I haven't won once. Because you have happiness in love. - There must be a way to win. - Cheating. All right, boys, one more time. Ïa¾šie. Yes, you get the money so you don't get distracted. Here is a joker, one, the other, another joker, another, another... - Give me good cards. - Me too. I have a hunch that all the cards are good this time. You're talking. - I bet 4. - You bet 4 because you have? He'll tell you, you look stupid. - I stand. - And you? I don't have good cards, I'm standing. I have good cards, I raise by 4. Okay, I can. I shuffle the cards and the fun begins. - How much? - One. One. - Three. - One, two, three. And me... One, two, three, four. Why four if the limit is three? - I give out, don't I? - Yes. That's why I gave myself four cards because I like it. Holy heaven, boys, that's it. Go on, he has good cards. I keep going, I have nice cards. - What do you have? - I'll give you a couple. It's not good, I have 4 aces. Wait, wait, not so fast, man. - What are you taking? - What am I taking? 2 spades, 4 hearts, 6 leaves, 8 spades and 10 diamonds. What is it? What is it? Spades, the best you can have me. - Spades? - I've never heard of it. Of course not, you're an Indian. Give it to me, I won this game. - Does anyone want a loan? - Give me $ 3. All right... - What do you have? - I have three jecks. - Not much, I have three kings. - I was expecting a trick. - Spades. - Bad. - What do you think, bad? - Three aces. I think you said that jumps of spades is the most you can do to me. But this only applies once a night. Pretty lady, let me enjoy your beauty. At twelve, there is a change of guard. I'll be waiting at the main entrance, it's time to run. - We need horses. - I have them. I see in your eyes that you still have a romantic life, - If it's not tactlessness, what do you do? - I trade in coffins. Dad, why are you still angry with Miss Larkin? - Am I angry? - Yes. If you feel better, I will tell you that we have already made peace. - Do you want something more? - Yes. Why don't you dance with her? She is very pretty. Alright. Don't you think I should give you diamonds now? They're safer with you. Smile, let's not arouse suspicion. Miss Larkin, I hope you're having a good time. Pretty good, but I was hoping you'd ask me to dance. Nothing would please me more. Although I wanted to suggest a walk in the moonlight. All right. I'm glad you and my daughter have become good friends. Nancy is a beautiful girl. You are very kind. Beautiful night. As Commander-in-Chief, I ordered the moon to appear. It couldn't be a beautiful moon. Now I would like him to stay forever. Forever captain? What a romance. I'm not a romantic, I'm afraid. When the moon disappears and the sun rises, we will be attacked by Indians. - Is it that serious? - More, in the last war with the Navajo, Nancy lost her mother. And you wife. The only consolation was to make peace with Chief White Eagle, but peace seems to be falling apart. Is there no way to stop the White Eagle? Yes, if I gave him three outlaws who killed his men, but I would not give them, even if I had them. Even if they were guilty? Their guilt must be decided by a court and not by a crazy Indian. I don't know why I'm bothered with my problems. Are you planning to stay longer in San Francisco? - It depends. - On your grandmother? I like it here, people are friendly, even you tonight. I know what she would be alone. I've always lived with my family, always with people, but... alone. Things can change overnight. Perhaps. We will come back? Why don't you sing something to us? Attention, please! Harry imitates Buffalo Bill. I will imitate Bufalo Bill. You were great. Excuse me, Captain, can I talk to you? Excuse me. Choose ladies and get ready for this party and we can get started. - Please, Captain, I can't anymore. - It's just a little, it won't hurt you. Captain, there's a man who attacked us. Mr. Black, take another pill, you have hallucinations. I'm not hallucinating, I'm sure. She's here, dancing with Mrs. Larkin. This is Mr. Murray, the cattle breeder. Ranèer. Yes? I assure you he is a thief and also a murderer. How do you know that? I recognized his laughter. That's exactly how he laughed when we were attacked. Thanks, Mr. Black, don't tell anyone about it. - Captain, what a surprise. - It is my pleasure. - What are you talking about with Dempster? - Don't be curious. - I want it. - Why? Here again, Captain. Mr Murray also seems to be interested in you. - Why do you think? - Have you seen him before? - Yes. - Where? - Tonight, in the dining room. - Really? Captain, Mr. Murray has the style of a man the woman is interested in. Could you see him at the raid? This Lorabelle, you missed it. - Come on, honey. - I'll take it. And now, Captain, I want you to open the door. Let the girl go to the floor. We'll release the girl when we leave the fortress. I said, open the door, cho Lorabelle. - I am not going. - Have you lost your mind? No, chu. That suits me very well. Let no one follow me. I said no one, back. It is better. Stay where you are, not the captain, you will come with me. You give the order to open the gate. Come on, go ahead. We are going. Now, Captain, command very loudly. Open the gate! Nancy! Nancy, are you okay? Father! Honey. - You were very brave. - Are you all right, Captain? - Sergeant, shut her down. - Yes sir. Open the gate! Come here, Mr. Vaughn. - Sergeant, shut them down. - Come on, shut them down! Sir, the Navajo Chief is coming with a white flag. - White flag? - Yes sir. So there is still hope, we will see what they want. Stay here, Lieutenant. White Eagle, if you go in peace, welcome and. Give me the whites who killed my people. If you give them to me, I'll leave in peace. Thanks to Bill Eagle for his help, you and your people can be there when they are judged. I don't want to rely on white justice. The anger will disappear over time. When he passes the stone, my patience ends. If you don't expose the culprits, I'll attack. Let's release them, or it will cost us dearly. Do you want to ask me to resign? - You've crossed the line. - It's hard for soldiers. Talking won't help, we're attacked in half an hour. Captain, don't make another mistake. What mistake, Lieutenant? You left the stagecoach without protection. - Are you showing me something, Captain? - Yes, Sergeant. Empty the armory, hand out all ammunition. Send Hamond to Mercy Fortress for reinforcements, if anyone can pass, it's navajo. Yes sir. The lives of our women and children are more important than those outlaws. They are, but it is our duty to abide by the law. As you watch, I do it my way. I want you to know that if we survive, I will file. Lieutenant, you are under my command. Take the children to school. What about women? They will charge the rifle and take care of the wounded. Yes sir. One more thing, Lieutenant. Bring the prisoners, they started it, we'll see if they can end it. Yes sir. I want you to take care of the wounded. - It would be my pleasure. - I'm happy about that. Captain... You keep talking and I stopped trusting you. - I hope you believe me. - A story with Grandma? - What should I do? - Follow me. Come on, quick. Dnu, children. They come from everywhere. I won't wait for them to come to the fortress. I need 6 volunteers to create a defensive barrier at the fortress. I'm going, sir. You do not. What are you waiting for, General Custer? I want to go too, sir. Wait, Lieutenant. You three are going too. Send us to death if you force us to go. This is murder. You are murderers, you will feel at home. Give them weapons, they go with you. Good luck, Lieutenant. Shoot the first man who tries to pass. Don't shoot until I say so. Wait until they get closer, you can't miss. Pa¾te! There are so many Indians that I don't know who they shot earlier. - Shoot what's closest. - All right, here it goes. - Did you hit? - Yes. - Where? - It'll be a while before he realizes it. Send more people back. There are hardly enough of us here. - Do it. - Yes sir. - Are you okay? - Yes, it's nothing serious. - Take care of the children. - Yes. The children are safe, Captain. I saw, Mrs. Larkin, you were very fast. Thanks. Go back to the men, I'll take care of the children. Stop the fire! Lieutenant Morgan wants to see you, sir. - All right, bring me Miss Larkin. - Yes sir. Down time, sir. Koèiš died. Well, it could be worse. Lieutenant, you can create a report if you want. I'll send her. Look, you've changed your mind. Maybe it will be better that way. More responsibility, you will also need to make quick decisions. - If you're lucky, some will be right. - Yes sir. - Where's Mrs. Larkin? - she can't come, sir. Why can't she come? - Because she's in jail. - In prison? I ordered her released. I know, Captain, but she came back as soon as the shooting stopped, - and he says he won't come. - How? What a woman she is. I would prefer to fix things with Indians. Nancy, what are you doing here? I tried to convince her to leave, but she didn't want to. I'll stay with Lorabelle. Well, you could be my boss, but I still command this fortress. Choose a sergeant. Dad, please don't close it. Nancy, listen to your father, go. - I wanted you to come, Mrs. Larkin. - This cell didn't let me. I want you to know that you are free. What am I? What I'm going to say now is I'm sorry... and I hope you believe me. Me too? I think yes. Children usually do not go to the wrong people. What do your officers think? The stagecoach leaves for the west in one hour. Do you think she will be ready by then? I'll be. Tradução Edição e Sincronia por WesternKasa /GM NOV2020
