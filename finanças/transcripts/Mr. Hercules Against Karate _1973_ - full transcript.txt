-[MOTOR RUNNING] -MAN: Look alive. Move it! Heads up, men. All right, on your toes, you guys! Get the lead out. Right on. Keep coming. -WORKER: Look out! The boss. -[METAL CLANGING] Down. Easy. Easy. Up, up. They're doing a fine job. That's the hardest working construction gang in Australia. Right on. Can you figure out how much we got in the kitty? DANNY: Well, with this month's check, and the severance dough, we can make it. We shake this dump, head back to Vegas and clean up. Peterson! -DANNY: Hey, Percy? -Yeah? -DANNY: He's calling Peterson. -So? -That's you. -BOSS: Peterson! Well, answer him. Yes, I was just going to. The big man calls, talk to him. Oh, no, no, no. Don't you go away, Danny. This chewing out is also for you. I'm with you. -You called us? -Yes, I called you. This is not a playground. You're paid to work. I do not pay people for doing nothing. DANNY: But we are working. He was maybe, but you weren't. You never work. How many men would you say are needed to carry this rail? Two. And how many are we? Two. Next time I catch you goofing off, I will fire you both. You work or else, I'll show you who's boss. PERCY: Man, he's really uptight, isn't he? Must be constipated. DANNY: Come here a second. Those two idiots! That's the last straw. Get those two screwballs out of here. You're fired, both of you! I warn you, get out of here and stay out! [MEN SCREAMING] Help! Hey, what you trying to do, wreck the joint? This time, you've gone too far. You will regret this day. Take it out... MAN: Hey, get me down! Help! Get me down! MAN 2: Get yourself down. We got work to do. MAN 3: Maybe we can fly, angel face. MAN 2: Don't let the boss see you. Wise guys. PERCY: That's real loyalty. Still sending in suggestions. I suggest that he drop dead. [SIREN BLOWING] COOK: One. Two. Hey, what is this, the drinking man's diet? Orders from the boss. No work, no eat. Hey, Percy. -Yeah? -I got news for you. -What? -It's a secret. -I can't hear you. -It's... Hey, you guys! MAN: Give me my plate back. Give me my bread. That's... Hey, thank you. [CHUCKLING SLYLY] [SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION] I thought I told you to fire those two. They are still here. Sit down. Well, I tried to, sir, but they refused to go until after lunch. COOK: Hope you enjoy it, sir. Those two are ruining my digestion. But as true as God made little green apples, I'll make them pay for it. I'll break them! -Sorry, sir. -Is it hot, sir? No! Too much salt. MAN: Hey, look who's coming. MAN 2: The big man himself. Percival? Percival, come over here, will you? -Who, me? -Yeah. Give us a hand, the cable's stuck. We need you to help us pull it free. Yeah? Sure. Hold this. Watch your step down there, you'll hurt yourself! That weighs a ton. You got rocks in your head? Ah! Always complaining. I could have broken my back. Hey, grab on. No, no. Let go. I'll do it. He'll do it. I gotta see this. Hey, Percival, is it true your sister calls herself Harry? MAN 2: Yeah, she hates to be called George. MAN: Pull, man, you got it. -That's it. Come on. -Hold yourself. BOTH MEN: Come on, Hercules. Pull, baby, pull! [CRYING OUT] Look out! He pulled the whole damn rig down! That's right! Let's get out of here! Look out! Come back! Look out! Look out! [INDISTINCT YELLING] To the cab! It's gonna blow sky high! What's happening? What's going on? SECRETARY: An earthquake. BOSS: I won't permit it. Oh, my God! We struck a gusher! SECRETARY: Oh, how wonderful! A gusher? We struck oil! Black gold! It's raining petroleum! DANNY: Percival, what have you done now? They said to yank, so I yanked. You will pay for this, you hear? You'll pay for Gunther. This is the last straw! You're fired! We tied the cable to a rig. It was only a joke. -We never thought he could do it. -You didn't, huh? Well, don't ever let him think that, because he'll kill you with one punch. Danny. Sorry. BOSS: What severance pay? You're just lucky I changed my mind, and decided not to make you pay for the damage. But you've got insurance? [BOSS SCOFFS] Read this. "Cases not covered by insurance." Well, what's this got to do with us? It excludes acts of God and natural disasters. That goofball is hardly an act of God, but disaster he is. He's a natural. He's as useful around a building site as a major earthquake. Now get him out of here! Gorillas belong in zoos! Get out! Both of you! And don't ever darken my doorstep again! If you need a letter of recommendation, ask your zookeeper. Shut the door behind you. Gently! I'm no good. I'll never be any good. It's no use, I'm good for nothing. What's the use? I'll never amount to nothing. It's no good. Hey, Percival, what are you grumbling about? I was thinking of what a flop I am. I was born a disaster. A natural disaster. For example, when the doctor tried to spank the breath out of me when I was born. Well, I hit him back, and I almost broke his jaw. A disaster. So what? We all make mistakes. Sure, sure, but it's always my fault. I made you lose your severance pay. We'll never make it back to the States. We'll wind up a couple of ugly beggars. Come on, now, don't take it so hard. -We'll find another job. -[CRYING OUT] Watch it. It's still sore. No, Danny. You're a good kid. I can't go on holding you down. I've gotta do what I've gotta do. Such as? Go away. We'll both go our own ways. So long, Danny, old boy. Hold it, Percy. Wait a minute. It's no use. I've made up my mind. You knucklehead. Hey, Percival! You're forgetting something. Hold on. I got something to tell you. Well, hold on, will you? Hold it! Oh, cut it out, Percy. You can't drop me like this. It's for your own good, Danny. And I thought you were a friend of mine. That's no way for a pal to act. How am I gonna make it without you? [CHUCKLING] Come on, Percy, give the man his bus back. -Sorry. -Sorry. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. [IN SING-SONG VOICE] Percival. [TIRE EXPLODING] [CRASHING] DRIVER: Look out! Not the window! No! [GLASS SHATTERING] Mustn't touch. Yeah. -Two beers. -Yes, sir. We could have a little lunch while we're at it, huh? Why not? The trouble is, they might ask us to pay for it. We're that broke? Mmm-hmm. Very broke. -Here you are. -Thanks. Hey, how much is a baloney sandwich? It's 50 cents. Well, then. Ah! [CHUCKLING] Yeah. Hey, Mister, excuse me. [CLICKING TONGUE] What are you saving this bread for? This is the one I want. That's a sandwich! Mmm! Good. [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Whoo! Now, come on. ALL: Whoa! Drink up, champs! Give us beer! TEAM: We're number one! Go, team, go! We're number one! Go, team, go! [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Beer! Beer all around! Yeah, beers for everybody! Hey, Perc, ever think about playing football for money? Yeah, I tried, but the ball split open -every time I squeezed it. -[CHUCKLING] Hey, why don't you watch where you're going? Why don't you two guys just drink a toast to number one? Oh! Okay, here's to number one, a toast to baloney. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Oh, but maybe that's saying too much. Hey, holy cow. Watch it, Mr. Number One. It's still sore, I'm having lunch. Oh, yeah? Well, try a bite of this. Oh, it's tasty. I bet you made it yourself. I'd take more, but right now, I'm too full of baloney. Yeah. Hey, Danny, I just thought of something. Do you... Do you think they're looking for a fight? Well, offhand, I would think so. PERCY: I would, too. Dog gone. -Get him! -Get him! Hold him! [SCUFFLING] [PERCY GROWLING] [ALL CRYING OUT] -Watch it! -I'm sorry! Where is everybody? 72 and 35, hike. DANNY: En garde. Touche. Four. Upward. [CHUCKLING] Not there. Not by the hair. Hold it! [CHUCKLING SHEEPISHLY] You're going right in the barrel! -Ready? -Ready. Ahhh! Use the door. [PUNCHING] No baloney! Flying saucers! Look out! [SHATTERING] DANNY: Come and get it. A-ha! Hey, Danny. Danny, where are you going, boy? DANNY: Out. [WHISTLING] [WHISPERING] My turn. ...24, 27, 69, 70, hike! You're gonna be off sides. -[SIRENS WAILING] -The police cars. -Beat it, the fuzz. -The fuzz. [SIRENS GETTING LOUDER] Come on, you guys. Danny. Danny, wake up. The fuzz is here. Danny! -All right, what's going on here? -Nothing. Which one's the boss? DANNY: Who won? Easy. Had a little trouble here? Most honorable officer, nothing is wrong. Who threw the bomb? I can explain, honorable officer. You see, I have to remodel the place. And I was having these two gentlemen demolish the old furnishing. Hmm. I see. Okay, okay, just tell us what the damage is, and we'll wash dishes. Fifty thousand dollars, okay? [WHISTLES] We'll have to wash dishes for at least 200 years. Not wash dishes. I will give you 50,000. You got another joint you want wrecked? Hey, Danny, why don't we go into business -wrecking joints like... -Shh! Most honorable friends, would you mind remaining to dine with me? So, honorable friends, I believe the moment has come to explain what I would like from you. It has to do with Hen Chu. -Gesundheit. -No, no, Hen Chu is my son. My 10-year-old child who my wife took with her, when she ran away. Oh, I get it. You want us to bring your son and wife back? No, only my son. My wife is Harlot. -If you say so. -Say what? That your wife is... [CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY] -Wife name is Harlot. -DANNY: Oh! She ran away with another man. Very powerful. A teacher of kung fu. His name, Hung Lo. Who's hung low? He's Hung Lo. Well, then, who's this guy called Charlotte? I already have tried to send some people, private detectives. But... But I have never heard from them again. A radiograph of one is the only thing which has come back to me. You mean a photograph? No, no. A radiograph. X-ray. [SNAPS FINGERS] Show the gentleman. That is the last man I sent. Former wrestler. Tibia and thorax damage after encounter with Hung Lo. This is crazy. What do you make of it, Percy? Looks like he went through a meat grinder. -Did I here you say 100,000? -50,000. Make it 100. We gotta pay for the X-rays ourselves. We're too young for Medicare. All right, make it 100,000 dollars. -Just so you bring back my Hen Chu. -Gesundheit. FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Captain Chow and his crew are happy to welcome you aboard our flight from Sydney to Hong Kong. The personnel on board are at your service. Oh, no, nothing. Thanks. [SNAPPING FINGERS] -Something to drink? -Oh, why sure. I'll have a little shot. -Are you the personnel on board? -Yes, sir. Nice personnel. Don't get personal. That's with one N. Maybe I can't spell, but personally, I like it. Ginger ale. Like being home again. Oh, no, sir. It's champagne. Imported. Yeah? Taste like ginger ale. If you say so, sir. DANNY: Another point for you, Percy. Is there anything I can do for you, sirs? Yes. Yes. Tell us your name, and what you're doing tonight in Hong Kong. My name is Ai-Lan. And about tonight? DANNY: About tonight? I don't know yet. If you accept my invitation to dinner, I'll sew up the dress for you. Looks like it's coming apart. Or does it just seem that way? -It's stuck! -What's stuck? The window. It won't open. They're not supposed to open, you twit. We'd all go flying out. Why aren't you eating? I tried, but with these? Look, try to keep it neat. For once, we're going first class. -Finished your lunch? -Oh, yes. -Can I take your trays? -Yes, sure. PERCY: Wait, I'll fix it up nice and neat for you. You don't wanna spill anything. -Not in first class anyway. -[METAL SQUEALING] There you are, Miss. Percy, down. PERCY: Oh, it wasn't all that good anyway. Teacher of kung fu. I wonder what that is? Oh. Maybe Chinese checkers. Who would know? Anyway, he's a schoolteacher. Should be easy. Oh, it will be a snap. Well, what about tonight? You never know. MAN: In a few minutes, we will be landing at Hong Kong airport. Kindly fasten your seat belts and refrain from smoking, please. AI-LAN: Goodbye, sir. DANNY: See you tonight. Have a nice stay in Hong Kong. -Bye. -Bye. -Oh, boy, am I hot? -I like it hot. You never saw Hong Kong before, huh? No. But I saw King Kong on the late, late show. -Goodbye, sir. -Bye. Have a nice day. Esmeralda, here I am, over here. Hey, here I am. [GASPING] -Hey, isn't that great, huh? -Yeah. Hey, come on, let's get us a rickshaw. I'll have a martini, thanks. -It's a taxi. -Oh! Empress Hotel. Hey, listen, what happens if we lose each other in traffic? I don't speak a word of Chinese. DANNY: Don't worry about it. I told your guy where to go. Oh, you think of everything. Forward. Oh, just a second, I wanted... DANNY: Oh, you overgrown elephant. Get in. Rickshaw all broke. Cost 100 dollars. Special price to you. The personnel on board is always at your service, sir. [CHUCKLING] Ai-Lan. I am going into town. -You want a ride in? -Oh, boy, am I glad to see you. -Do you mind driving? -Oh, it would be a pleasure. Bring the bags. [ARGUING IN CHINESE] [SIGHING] -It's gorgeous, don't you think so? -Sure do. It looks like San Francisco with wonton soup. [ARGUMENT IN CHINESE CONTINUING] -What are those guys mad about? -They're kung fu fighters. -What? -Kung fu. The Chinese national sport. DANNY: Who's playing today? The basket cases against the wheelchairs? [ALL CRYING OUT] You see the writing on the car? "Kung fu Cripples Association." Kung fu-ers are like that. They go on fighting till they die. The blacks are professionals? No. Those are the amateurs. They play for fun. What is it like when they play for real, I wonder? The object of kung fu is to overcome any obstacle. That's kung fu. You get it? Oh, they're really great. And if they're good, think what their teacher's like. Yeah, she must be out of this world. Twit. [FOGHORN BLOWING] [PERCY GRUNTING] I'm sorry. I have trouble getting out of these little kiddie cars. What's that? A boomerang. Souvenir from Australia. Excuse me. So long. Thanks a lot for the lift. AI-LAN: See you soon. Goodbye. -See you later for dinner, okay? -Who knows? -Did you say eat? -Down! [CHUCKLING] Percy, try to behave for a change, okay? PERCY: I always try. -We have a room reserved. -Very good, sir. -Would you sign the register? -Yeah, sure. RECEPTIONIST: Room 325. Third floor. DANNY: Thank you. [EXCLAIMS APPROVINGLY] -Third floor. -ELEVATOR BOY: Yes, sir. -May I, sir? -Thank you. [DANNY WHISTLING] ELEVATOR BOY: Third floor, sir. Hey, elevator boy, are you sure this is the... Hey! That's funny. Hey, what kind of a third floor is this? Ah! Basement, not third floor. That's another storey. DANNY: Is that a joke? CHINESE MAN: No joke. DANNY: Then it's a mistake. No mistake, stranger. DANNY: It's not a joke and not a mistake. How many questions have I got left? Yeah. DANNY: Look, iron balls, open your other eye and tell us what's going on, okay? What does all this mean? It means that you and your friend will be wrapped up and returned to dishonorable Wang that sent you. Listen, are you trying to tell me that you'd rather we left the hotel and went home, is that it? Booked full today, huh? Oh, listen, Danny, if they don't have any vacancies, let's change hotels. -You've got a vacancy upstairs. -[CRYING OUT] If it's not asking too much, would you mind lending me a hand? This ain't an exhibition match. I only wanted to see how they do it. They're great, huh? They impress me. I will give you a personal demonstration, honorable tub of lard. -PERCY: It's still sore. -[MOANING] Give you a hand. Okay? -Yeah, sure. Except for the heat. -[BEEPING] PERCY: I thought you told me you liked it hot? Good heavens. It's so hot. [MOANING] Operator, it's boiling up here. I can't stand it. It's cooking the fish. They're turning red. [YELLING] PERCY: Hey. Pipe down. Oh, no. Hey! [BEEPING] Oh, I can't stand it! Oh, it's freezing in here! [METAL CLANGING] -Come on, I found the exit. -Where? [YELLING] [SPITTING] [BANG] There's sure good service in this hotel. [CHUCKLING] We're all freezing. We'll catch pneumonia. It's a disgrace. First, it's boiling, then it's freezing. I'd like to get my hands on the elevator operator. PERCY: Eeny, meeny, miny, moe which one took us to the basement floor? Well, I'm afraid it won't be easy. [THUDDING] MAN: Halt! Attention. ALL: Master Hung Lo. Ping Pong. Chian Cashet. Sun A Gun. He Bella. Ikan I. Shantung. Yu. This is a school. And one goes to school to learn and to be taught lessons. And there is one lesson you must not forget. How to obey. I order you, therefore, to capture these noble samurai, and deliver them to me, bound hand and foot, lying at my feet. You may begin. Step down, Katacana. Defend yourself without mercy. Teach them the painful cost of failure, which you will collect in their blood. [GULPING] [ALL CRYING OUT] [STUDENTS GROANING] You have failed again. Now, you will learn the price of failure. Line up. Complete the lesson now. [CRIES OUT] [STUDENTS WHIMPERING] Have you learned the lesson? ALL: Yes, master. Let us hope so. Well done. When the floor has been mopped and is dry once more, prepare another squad. -Hen Chu. -[CRIES OUT] How many times have I told you? You are not to touch the cherries. You are not to open my safe, Hen Chu. Your mother has told you this as well. Harlot is my stepmother, not my mother. Don't answer me in such a tone. Just think, I could be your father. I found out that you're my brother. Your brother? I heard a man say that you are Harlot's son. I am Harlot's stepson, so you are my stepbrother. That makes us two of a kind almost, Hung Lo. You brat! Go to your room! Hung Lo, why are you always so severe to the child? The child drives me crazy. There's no way to control him. Has he been back at the... Yes, the cherries. Our cherries. -What is it this time? -PERCY: Nothing. Oh, I bumped into the vase, -and it fell down and broke. -Mmm. Yeah. What have you got in your hands? Me? Nothing. Nothing in my hands. -Nothing, huh? -No. Nothing. Honest. Why, don't you believe me? Don't you trust me? DANNY: Oh, sure. But let's see it. Oh, that thing. Oh, it doesn't go straight, anyway. That's right. I know it doesn't go straight, because I got conked twice this morning. And that was how you broke the vase. Do me a favor, get rid of this thing. But this is all I got left of my collection of souvenirs from Australia. You wouldn't let me keep that baby kangaroo. Just throw it away. -What? The kangaroo? -The boomerang. Hmm? Hmm. Look! It won't go. It's gotten attached to us. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hello. Well, yeah, of course. Yeah, sure. I'll be down in a minute. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure I'm glad. Oh, yeah. You bet. Right. See you downstairs. Bye. That was Ai-Lan. She managed to get the evening off. I've got a date with her. You're gonna leave me alone? Oh, you know I wouldn't do that. She found a girl for you. -For me? -That's right. So, come on, get a move on. Mustn't keep the girls waiting. -Go make yourself beautiful, huh? -Oh, I sure will. Oh, elephant. I'll hurry, so you can use the shower. Where's the soap? Ah! A little hot water. [PERCY HUMMING] [CHUCKLING] [IN A CHOKED VOICE] How much of that perfume did you put on? The whole bottle. But there was only a half a pint. Whoa! AI-LAN: Well, hello. DANNY: Oh, hi. Hello. This is Lee-Ping. -DANNY: Hello, Lee Ping. -Pleased to meet you. Meet Danny, and that's Percival. That's me. -How do you do? -I'm all right. A little fidgety, maybe. My name is Lee Ping. PERCY: Put her there, Lee Ping. [CHUCKLING] I'm Percival. [SUPPRESSING LAUGHTER] -I know a place. -May I help you, sir? I made a reservation at the Peking Restaurant. I think you'll like it. [LEE-PING CHUCKLING] I hate these doors. I'm always getting lost. -Rickshaw? -No, thanks. Taxi. Nice night, huh? Taxi. After you. -Thank you, Danny. -Not you. -Why not? -You're co-pilot. [GROANS] I always have to ride in the suicide seat. [CLASSY MUSIC PLAYING] It's a little crowded tonight. -Good evening. -Good evening. Table for four, sir. Right here please. [CHUCKLING LIGHTLY] So sorry to be late. Don't get up, gentlemen. [CRYING OUT] MAN: Oh, are you all right? MAN 2: Here, let me help you. -[LAUGHING] -Oh! -Oh, what a stupid accident. -Oh, I'm all right. I am so sorry. All right. All right. Sit down, please. It could happen to anyone. We all fall once in our... [CRIES OUT] MAN: Oh, dear, this is impossible. Are you sure you didn't stop somewhere on the way here, dear? I'm beginning to feel a part of the floor show. Oh, forget it. -[CRIES OUT] -What's that? Just the drummer. ♪ The things that you have in mind, I say, my love ♪ But let's say, my love ♪ You can be... -DANNY: Percy. -Yeah. -DANNY: How's the food here? -Well, it's the best. -DANNY: What do you recommend? -Depends on what you like.

PERCY: That depends on what he's peeking at. [ALL LAUGHING] -Percy. -[PERCY CLEARING THROAT] AI-LAN: Wait a minute. Er... Sorry, but those are not toothpicks. They are for eating. Ah!

There's a dragon following us. Ah, once you've seen one dragon, you've seen them all. -It can't be a dragon. -I tell you that's a dragon. I know a dragon when I see one. It's got 10 feet and a tail. Holy cow, you're right. A green dragon. I warned you about that jealousy bug. -Looks like a big worm. -Yeah. Or a green caterpillar. Hey, it's winking at us. I bet it's just a publicity stunt.

HUNG LO: I should have by now had the Americans in my clutches. And long dead. Had I only managed to have men around me less incapable, less stupid, and less cowardly than the three of you are. Now I ask you, do I have to call in the samurai every time? BOY: Oh, no, Master, not that. We'll not fail again. Please. Please, Master. No, Master, not that. We shall do our best next time, I swear. Please, not the samurai. Not kamikaze. Honorable Kata. [FLY BUZZING] [CRIES OUT] [MAN WHIMPERING] The next time, you will take the place of the fly if you fail me again. -Is that clear? -Yes, Master. Now go and do your duty. What a paltry lot. Where are the professional killers? Where are the traditions and the old values gone forever? [DOOR CLOSES] What is wrong, my dearest little cherry blossom? I see a sadness in your eyes, my love. I'm afraid, Hung Lo. Of whom? Of those two jackasses your husband sent this time? [CLICKING TONGUE] They'll end up like all the others. Hen Chu is too precious to lose. He's the only weapon we can use to stop your husband. And he'll never get him. This I swear. As long as I am Hung Lo. Hmm. Let's go and take a look at Hung Lo's house. The first duty of a general in combat is to study the terrain. Then you wanna leave even before we find the kid? No, why? Well, you just said you wanna study the train schedule. Well, I meant we should start doing what we're here for. Namely, get that kid and bring him back to his daddy. -Right? -Yeah. You're not wrong. Uh, do you know of a kung fu teacher named Hung Lo? Everybody knows of Hung Lo. How can we get in touch with him? Hung Lo does not receive visitors. Even friends since he has none. Then perhaps he'll see his enemies, huh? Ah, Hung Lo has no enemies, sir. Those he had are all in their graves if you see what I mean. DANNY: Well, can you give us his address? It's very hard to find, but I think a taxi might be able to get you there if he's mad enough to try. DANNY: Well, write it down. You never know. As you wish, sir. Let's see. Hey, don't bother writing it in Chinese because I can't read. There you are, sir. Okay, thanks. You're welcome, sir. [SNIFFING] What are you doing? -You free? -Yes. -Thanks to Comrade Mao. -No politics, please. [EXCLAIMS] [CHUCKLES] That's using your head. Hey, kid, Hung Lo's house, please. Okay. PERCY: Follow that cart, driver. Watch the curb. Stay on his tail. Don't lose him. Try second gear. Hey. Let me out. Hey, Danny! Hey, wait! Danny! Hey, what a freaky set up, huh? Like Coney Island with soy sauce. -Hey, Danny. Look. -Yeah? King-sized lizard. It's a dragon, idiot. Huh. How can you tell when a dragon's an idiot? Come on, let's go downstairs. Hold it. Hung Lo's house. PERCY: Some pad. Doesn't look like there's anybody around. Let's take a closer look. They will soon be walking into my trap. Hmm. And this time, Master, there's no escaping. I trust not. The entire squad is standing ready, Master. They will destroy them. Be sure they do, because if they do not, you will be wearing your other eyeball in your left ear. [WHIMPERING] Are they here? Yes. They are about to learn who Hung Lo is. Hey, Danny, dig that crazy tiger. Looks real, doesn't he? Like he could tell us a whole lot of things about life and... Hmm. Yeah, look. Hey, watch it! That's my sore shoulder. [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [LAUGHING SINISTERLY] [ALL SHOUTING] [CRYING OUT] Danny! Where are you? Danny! Hey, Percy! -Where are you? -Up here. [GRUNTS] [CRYING OUT] [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Hey, it looks real. Sorry. [SNEEZES] Gesundheit. [ALL SHOUTING] Get him! Get him! Gung ho. We must get him! Don't let him get away! Capture him or I will be fall guy... [SCREAMS] [YELLS] [CRIES OUT] WOMAN: Oh, thank you. Thank you, honorable stranger. We make very good soup out of that. Impurities out. This best stuff. All organic. Wash two time with... [GIGGLES] No detergent. Real soap. Make washing two times brighter. No dishpan hands. 99% pure. Thanks. How are you called? -My name's Danny. What's yours? -Hi, Danny. I'm Wan, honey. You're kind of cute. So cute. [GIGGLES] Danny! Come on over. Hey, you're taking boat rides while I've been fighting off an army. That's the breaks. Give me your hand. Now, I was worried about you but you managed okay, I see. Well, sorry, is that your bar of soap? -So long, soapie. -So long, cutie. You know, I didn't think you could make it without me, but you're a lot tougher than you look. I saw you out there. Man, did you look good. Oh, this is crazy. What a way to make 100 grand. That's no lie. [GRUNTING IN FRUSTRATION] Hey, stop! Can you give us a ride? -Of course. -Thanks a lot. Yeah, nice of you, fella. Thanks. -Where you going? -To the police station. Do honorable strangers dislike if I should declare them under arrest? Nice sound-proof office you got here. -Your passports. -Passports. Here you are. You know this young lady? We met her yesterday, when a certain Wang sent us to Hong Kong. She's a stewardess on the plane. And what are you doing here for this Wang, as you call him? We're to bring his son back to him. The kid's with Harlot. That's his mother. Is that so? Did you know that Hung Lo is a notorious smuggler and that his school is really a band of hired killers... Mobsters who are experts in kung fu and karate? Well, someone ought to teach them not to fight with their feet. Oh, so you've met them? Well, in a way. But they won't trouble you for a while. You eliminated Hung Lo's gang single-handed? Actually, we used both hands. Now, look, don't ask us for damages. We didn't start it. We acted in pure self-defense. [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] What are they talking about? How should I know? There are no subtitles. Young man, we want to help you. You want your revenge on Hung Lo. Is that right? -That's right. -Good. You have my special permission to enter the mansion, to give him a good beating, if that's what you want. But we fight only when provoked. If they give us the kid without breaking our backs, -well, we won't hurt them. -Very well. Then let's say tomorrow at 6:00 sharp, we'll break into the mansion, and if Hung Lo hasn't given the child back to you, we'll take care of making sure he does. -All right? -All right. -Are we free now? -Free as birds. See you tomorrow morning then. Fine. Thanks. Sayonara. Never fear, we are behind you. Thanks. You understand? Americans are real suckers. And how is my beautiful China doll today? Give us a kiss. I am sorry. You have made a big mistake. [LAUGHING] Kindly put me down, please. Where's Lee-Ping? I'm sorry, Percival. She had to remain in Singapore. She's replacing the stewardess on another flight. Jiminy. What will I do for a date? You can come with us. You're sure to find another girl with that Tarzan of the Apesact. And then if we can close our deal, we'll go look for Lee-Ping after we've seen Wang. Come with us. I reserved a table at an enchanting restaurant. It's right on the bay. No, I better stay in the hotel. You two go. I'll see you later. Okay. Yeah, but don't forget, we have an appointment -at 6:00 in the morning. -Mmm-hmm. Put me down, please. Who wants a girl with a greasy moustache? [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] Excuse me. -Good evening, sir. -Good evening. Yeah. -To eat. Any ideas? -Hash is good. -What else? -Hamburger, chili, pizza pie. A hamburger? Gosh, it's just like home. Oh, forget it. It brings back too many memories. You are homesick? -For girl? -No. I'm dying to eat good old U.S. chow. Chow mein is Chinese dish. Why not you take hash? We use bean sprout and bacon using soy sauce. With soy sauce and bean sprouts, huh? I'll bet it's great. Oh, hey, now, I'll bet you're trying to put me on. I'll try the spaghetti. -Milanesi? -No. Al dente. Mmm. Al dente. -Pardon me, sir. -No, my name is... Huh. I didn't order a drink. As long as it's free. [BELCHES] [MUSIC STOPS] [ALL GASP] [MUSIC STARTS] ♪ [BELCHES AGAIN] -Chow mein? -Yeah. Well, I knew I wouldn't get spaghetti. No matter what you order, you still eat chop suey. Italian style. -How's that? -Al dente. MAN: Sir? Uh, what's your specialty? The client catches his own fish with a net, then we offer suggestions as to how to cook it -and the sauce to use. -And what if we catch a whale? We charge only for the portion that you eat. Fine. Please. -Fun, isn't it? -Mmm-hmm. Come here. That's far enough. But we haven't lowered our nets yet. The fish is in the net, sir. Our master, Hung Lo, will enjoy his dinner tonight. We are bringing him two fish. Please. Man, oh, man, 55 bucks for that garbage. That's too much. There you are. That's all you get. [EXCLAIMS] $50! Hooray for USA, al dente! [SIGHS] Oh, what was in that chow mein? I've heard of spinnakers, but this is going overboard. [GROANS] [CHUCKLING] Hung Lo will be pleased. We finally managed to capture our whale. [CHUCKLES] Missed. Tie him up. We will throw him at the master's feet. This time, you have lost the struggle. I have paid you back. I am revenged. The wheel has come full circle. My tooth. DANNY: Sleep well? Hi, Danny. You got back early, didn't you? [GROANS] I'm sick as a dog. Stomach pains. Man, that meal I had was mountainous. So I see. You got an upset stomach? Try bicarbonate of soda. Get up. What am I, a chair? The nerve of that fatso. Well, come on over and give us a hand. What? Where are we? Who tied you up? You just think about it and I'm sure you'll figure it out. Hmm. We're not playing cowboys and Indians, are we? HUNG LO: So, we meet face to face at last. That is what you wanted, was it not? So you're Hung Lo? Modestly, yes. Master of all the traditional and the noble martial arts: Kung fu, karate, uncalmed king of Hong Kong. And you are the spies Wang sent to find Hen Chu. -Gesundheit. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Enough! Yes, enough. Enough of your idiotic foolishness. Lee-Ping. What are you doing with Gung Ho? Percival. Are you all right? I'll let no harm befall her, provided you all agree. -PERCY: To what? -My conditions. To his conditions. The girls are hostages, are they? You sure play dirty, Hung Lo. HUNG LO: Go join your friends. We usually execute spies on the spot, but I preserved for you a different treatment. Many times you've beaten my best team. You are wondrously skilled in the martial arts of the west. You have demonstrated your prowess. You have proved your talent against my finest fighters. -Better? -Yes. Where did you learn? What's your school? Slippery Rock Teachers College. Master of the steel palm? Platinum head? Karate? Which? Well, there's the old one-two and the left jab. The right to the rib cage. Good. How would you like to come to my side? Leave Wang's employ and work for me? -PERCY: Any money in it? -I can pay you well. And what if we refuse? Then, you must die. [WOODEN SHOES CLUNKING] This is my samurai and this my sumo champion. -Hoop U. -PERCY: Hoop U? Hey, I knew a terd once called hoop yours. Yeah, he played water polo. Never mind, Percy. You mean, if we don't accept, we'll have to fight your whole team. Hoop U, show them how strong you are. [GRUNTS] [GASPS] HUNG LO: Would you care to demonstrate your strength? [GRUNTING] And that's what killed vaudeville. [STOOL THUDDING] [GRUNTS] Hmm. Hmm. [BLOWS] Keep the change. That's enough. Let's see how you do against all of them. Brute force is not the only thing needed to win. You must always show intelligence, the ferocity of a tiger, the cunning of a serpent. Let the fighting begin. [FLY BUZZING] [SCREAMS] [YELLS] Timber! Hey, one at a time. Danny, oh, no! Hold on, I'm coming. Rats! Hang on, Danny, I'm coming. Get lost, fatty. [ALL YELLING] Hey, what is this? Seven to one? Now, what kind of fair play is this? [SCREAMS] Hey, fatty, I wanna talk to you about your weight. I wanted to see you around here in this gym. Understand? So you're out and for good. [SCREAMING] Oh, these props cost money. It's beginning to be a bore. [EXCLAIM] [GASPS] [CRIES OUT] Yaha yourself, you dummy. [GRUNTING] Watch out! Here we... [CRIES OUT] -Master? Master, what shall we do? -We'll leave at once. -Hen Chu? -Yes, sir. Don't touch the cherries. Guard these with your life. Assemble all teams and meet us at the airport. Assemble all teams? Yes, sir. -And hurry. -Yes, sir. And hurry. This is Yu reporting. All teams to the airport. Emergency. Yu, all teams, go to airport. This is emergency. Yu. [ALL YELLING] All teams, report to the airport at once. Look out! They're trying to get away! Hurry! Dog gone, the door is locked! Look out! Stand back! [CRIES OUT] Oh! Oh! Emergency! Emergency! Calling all teams, report to airport! Report to airport! Did you hear that? They're going to the airport. -Hey, Danny? -Huh? -What do I do with this? -Forget it. See you. Let's go. [GIRLS GIGGLING] Oh, dragon strikes again. PERCY: They went that way. Back to sleep. -Hey, did you stop them? -Who? Hung Lo and Harlot. They just left. Just left? I told you at 6:00 sharp. This watch is always right. Stop waving your hands. Come on. MAN: [OVER PA] Announcing the departure of Tiger Airlines, Flight 127 from Manila. Passengers will please proceed to gate number three for customs control. Attention, please. Tiger Airlines announcing the departure of Flight 127 from Manila. [YELLING] PERCY: Clear the traffic for the Hong Kong cannon ball. Laying down on the job, eh? Hey, you're out of uniform. -Where's your hats? Well, answer. -Sir. Quiet, you! Quick, get aboard. We still have time. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Stop that plane! Stop! Duck, idiot! You wanna wreck the airplane? They cost a billion dollars apiece. The wheel, Captain! [TIRES SQUEALING] MAN: I don't believe it. You're gonna tell me you couldn't see this plane? You don't need glasses, you need a seeing eye dog. Who's gonna pay for a new plane? Oh, yeah, send us the bill. MAN: [OVER PA] Tiger Airlines regrets to announce that it's Manila flight has been canceled due to a minor technical problem. PERCY: That ain't no ladder of success they're on. Now, hold it, guys. I'll fix you. Door to door service, that's us. [SIRENS WAILING] Danny! Oh, you guys want. DANNY: DDT, anyone? Beat it, red. You too, blue. Come on, quick. There's Hung Lo's jet. -What is wrong? -I'm giving it full power. There's something holding the ship. Go check. What a wind! [GRUNTING] Surround the plane. Hold it, you two, you're under arrest. DANNY: Watch out for the child, Captain. Bring him along. -The cherries. -Don't worry, we got the cherries. Peterson? Peterson? Good work. We would never have captured them without you. Oh, yeah? Oh, we did it! We did it! Let me shake your hand. That's nice of you, sir. Hey, hold that plane. -Ai-Lan! -Danny, wait! -Danny? -Has he got a pilot's license? Ai-Lan! Danny! But where are they going? What shall they do? [GASPS] [SCREAMS] You didn't tell me that you know how to fly. I don't. Oh! Danny, if you don't know how, what'll we do? Good question. What do you suggest first? Just land, please. Okay. [GASPS] You're pushing the throttle in. -Oh, is it this one? -No, not that! Oh, sorry. Are there parachutes? Good question. He's got it under control. What a marvelous pilot. Thank gosh, I got all the cherries out. Yeah, kid, life's a bowl of cherries so let's have us a few. [LAUGHS] MAN: Take them away. Hung Lo would never let me eat cherries. He kept them locked up in the safe like treasures. That wasn't nice. -I like you better. -You stick with old Percival. MAN: We're told to stay on guard, sir. -To guard what? Cherries? -Let's go. PERCY: There they are. Boy, let's have a feast. Oh, you've got a sweet tooth like me, huh, kid? [HEN CHU GIGGLES] Good, hmm? I think you'd better try to land, don't you? [GRUNTS] It won't do what I tell it to. Hey, Danny, what's that? Oh, that's a VC-8. I think we had those pilots a little worried. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Tower to Romeo. Tower to Romeo. Come in. Where do you think you're going? We want you to establish contact at once. Tower to Romeo. Tower to Romeo. Come in, Romeo. Answer. Tower to Romeo. I don't hear anything. -Yeah? -[LOUD UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [EXCLAIMS] Turn off that music! You're on a commercial frequency. Keep your hands off the button. I'm sorry. It's our first flight. We all make mistakes. Try to listen. Well, you're going to put the plane on automatic pilot. Sure. Only how? It's the third button on the right. No, idiot! I said on the right! The right! Good. Good. Now, let go of the controls. Just sit still and we will bring you in. Understand? I guess I flunked. [EXCLAIMING] Perfect. -Where are the pots of cherries? -I don't know. You must know. Where are they? I left them back at the plane. Where? We've got to find them. Percival. Oh, no. [LEE-PING GIGGLING] This is not a laughing matter, young lady. We'll get to the bottom of this yet. -What do you mean? -You'll see. Those cherries are wanted by the CIA, the FBI, Interpol, and the Internal Revenue Service of the USA. MAN: Hung Lo removed the cherry pits, and inserted in their place pearls of an estimable value. There was a fortune in those jars. PERCY: Now he tells us. There's no way of knowing the total value of the treasure. Perhaps as much as a million dollars. PERCY: Say, that's a lot of fruit salad. It was a diabolically clever plot indeed. And if it weren't for you, he might have succeeded. The world's customs services would have lost millions in revenue. Hmm? You say you've eaten them all? Not all of them, but almost all of them. The kid had a cold and, feed a cold, as they say. And the pits? What did you do with the pits? Well, we ate them too. Here. This, as I promised, is the $100,000. Thank you. I am sorry you can't have Hen Chu back immediately. I will wait. It cannot take so long. [CHUCKLES] I hope not. Hey, Percy. I got the money. We're rich. That's good. Come on, now, hurry it up. Look, pal, I'm really doing my best. Remember, life is a bowl of cherries, Percy. Have you worked it all out? [EXPLOSION] [ALL LAUGHING] Shame to give up all the pearls. Too bad you couldn't have kept any. [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] What is it? I tried to eat them all, but I couldn't. -Look. -[ALL EXCLAIM] -No. -Well, they're souvenirs. MAN: Peterson. [ALL LAUGHING]
