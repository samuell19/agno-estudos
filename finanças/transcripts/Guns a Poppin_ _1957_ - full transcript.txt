[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] Mr. Moe, you're accused of assaulting your two roommates with intent to commit mayhem. You mean murder! And he also tried to kill us too. Yeah, you ought to hold him on a habeas corpusle. Yeah, that's telling them, kid. Yeah. Quiet! This complaint states that you attacked the plaintiffs with this. States Exhibit A. You admit this is your property, do you not? Well, Your Honor, do you mind if I look at it? You see, I had my name carved somewhere on the-- [GRUNTS] A born killer, eh? Sit down! But, Your Honor, if you let me tell my side of the story... You mean you have something to say in extenuation? Oh, not that. No, no. Not that, Your Honor. You see, I had a good reason. Were you ever indicted? Not since I was a baby, Your Honor. But I'm a sick man. A very sick man. And I've had two very serious operations. And this one here for crushed grape seeds. Right here. Oh, I have one exactly like that. You have? Yeah. Let me show it to you. Look. See here? Oh, that's a bum job. That's like hem stitching with a picot edge. [LAUGHING] Sit down, we'll continue with the testimony. As I said before, Your Honor-- You see, Your Honor, I'm a very sick man. Firstly, my creditors closed up my business. Secondly, I have to pay $10,000 or they'll put me in bankruptcy. And because of that, I had a nervous breakdown. So only a few days ago I was terribly sick, and my doctor said I must have quiet. Absolute quiet. Quiet. Quiet! Quit stomping around. Scat! [CAT MEWLS] Oh, my nerves. Oh. I must have 106 and seven-eighths. [GROANS] [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] [THERMOMETER CRACKS] MOE: Quiet! Quiet, you imbeciles! Hey, Joe, did you see my slide? No. [GROANING] Maybe it flew in there. Let's look. Hey, Moe, did you see a trombone slide? No, but I see a dream walking. [BOTH SCREAM] Moe! My nerves. [BOTH COUGHING] Gee, what a sorehead. Yeah. What did you expect? My creditors put me out of business, then I have a nervous breakdown and all you guys do is make it worse. You know my doctor said I must have quiet! Moe, what you really need is the quiet of the country. Yeah, Joe's right. Just picture the beautiful country. The babbling brook, the murmuring of the breezes through the threes, the mooses and the meeces. And the fresh air. [SNIFFS] [COUGHS] Moe, it'll make a new man out of you. Sounds pretty good. Sure, can't you just see it? Hunting and fishing. And at night, the open campfire. And, far away in the distance, you hear the call of the wolf. [WOLF WHISTLES] That's the wrong wolf. [HOWLING] Not so loud. Don't tell me. I know-- Don't yell at me. Now, look, I-- That noise. The noise. The noise, the noise! Now you made him nervous again. Oh! Oh, quick. Quick, my medicine. My pills. Medicine. Larry. All right, take it easy, Moe. Take it easy. [PILLS RATTLING] That ought to cure him. Or kill him. We better get packed. MOE: Hey, grub is ready. Come on, sit down, fellas. Oh, boy, am I hungry. Hey, it's a good thing we found this deserted cabin. Hey, this area is fine for hunting. How do you know? Well, I just saw a sign outside that says "fine for hunting." Oh, fine for... Oh. Have some bread. Oh, thank you. Ooh, scrambled eggs. And don't touch them until I come back with the fried potatoes. Hey, Joe, I forgot the sugar. I'll go get it. You worm. Where's your manners? Why didn't you leave me some of the eggs? I didn't touch them. MOE: No, you did, and don't make matters worse by lying about it. If this happens again, I'll gauge your eyes out. I'll tear your tonsils out three at a time. Oh, shut up! [GROANS] Big boss. Always telling us what to do. Don't do this, don't do that. Pardon me. What did you say? I said, oh, shut up. [GROANS] [COUGHS] Now, now you know what I mean. Ooh! At least I'll get my rightful share of the potatoes. I didn't do nothing! No, you didn't do nothing. You ate everything but the plate. Now you guys, make my breakfast. Boil me some noodles and fry me some eggs. Go on! Okay, you fry the eggs, I'll boil the noodles. You're gonna eat noodles for breakfast? MOE: All right, make it spaghetti. Oh, that's different. How do you want your eggs? Sunny-side down, and don't turn them over. Sunny-side over, and don't turn them down? This guy's nuts. Where's that fresh honey? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Ah. If there's anything I like better than honey and ketchup it's bologna and whipped cream, and we haven't got any. I'd love that. Spaghetti is ready-- [SCREAMS] MOE: Oh! What the...? Spaghetti. You stupe. Birdbrain. Moe, there's-- There's-- There's-- [SPITS] You imbeciles, what's the matter with you? There's a b-b-b-bear in the window. You're wacky, there's no bear in any window. There is too. [GROWLS] Oh! Oh! Oh! You're right. There is a bear out there. Here. You boys go out and shot him. I'd go too, but my nerves won't let me. I haven't got the nerve, either. Larry, you get him. All right, I'll go. But if that bear kills me I'll never talk to you again. Come on, Joe. I'll be right behind you. You see anything? No. Then what are you waiting for? Go ahead. Look at me shake, and I've got the chills again. Oh, my. [SNIFFING] [MOANS] That bear sure disappeared fast. Get him, the bear. Ouch! Oh! Ow! [GROANING] Hey, Moe, what do you know? The bear got away. Yeah, but you won't. BOTH: Oh! Oh! Oh! [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] Hey, somebody's starting our car. Either I'm dreaming or I flipped my lid completely. Oh, my nerves, my nerves. Hey, fellas. I just saw a bear drive our car away. He put his arm out to make a turn. Oh, oh. Come here. Come here. Just sit down. Yeah. Relax, Moe. Relax, he says. I see bears driving cars. I need $10,000. Oh, I wanna go home! Moe, sleep. Sleep, Moe. Shh. [GUNFIRE] I'll brain him! I'll brain him! [GUNSHOTS] Cut out that shooting or I'll brain you. This is the sheriff. I'm after Mad Bill Hiccup. The bandit. Yeah, and you're not gonna get me, either. Oh... They're driving me crazy. [GROANS] [GROANING] Ow! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, my nerves. Oh! [BONES CRACK] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my nerves. [GRUNTS] Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, you're squashing me. Joe, Larry. Help. Get off him, you big lummox. He's sick. What's the idea? [GUNSHOTS] Come on, Moe. Take it easy. We'll get you there. That's it. Don't get nervous. There you are, Moe. Take a big swig of that. Attaboy. One false move and I'll drill you guys. Listen, you! What? Just listen. [SIZZLING] JOE: You can't do that! MAD BILL: Oh? JOE: What are you doing? MAD BILL: Come on, fatso. Cut it out-- [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [BULLET RICOCHETS] [BULLETS RICOCHET] [SPITS] [GUNSHOT] [BULLETS RICOCHET] Yipe! [GUNSHOTS] Stick 'em up or I'll blast you. Yeah, stick 'em up or he'll blast you. Say, that's a nice gun you have there. Yeah, I got it form my bar mitzvah. Let me see it, will you? Sure. Oh! Hey, what are you trying to do? Break his gun? Get back there, you... I'll get that rat. [GUNFIRE] [SIZZLING] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh, that hurts! Ooh! Get around or I'll really hurt you. [ALL POPPING] Sheriff, come get this guy. We got him. All right, don't move. Hurry, hurry! Oh, nice work, fellas. And I might add very profitable too. There's a $10,000 reward out for this guy. Ten thousand dollars! Now I can pay my creditors. Oh, boy. Sheriff, that's wonderful. Thank you, sheriff. Very much. Oh, I gotta hug you for that. [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You fools! He got away! He got away. Now we won't get the 10 grand. You nitwits. [BOTH SCREAM] I'm gonna chop your heads off. No! Please. [SPUTTERS] Why you-- No, please. No, Moe, please. No, wait, no. No, no. I can explain the whole thing. I'll chop your head off. No, no, no! Now my doctor says I'll have to go back to bed for six months. I find the defendant not guilty. Case dismissed. Thank you, Your Honor. You're entirely welcome. Do you mind if I have Exhibit A back again, Your Honor? Certainly not. Help yourself. Thank you, Your Honor. He's got political pull. How do you like that? Yeah. Oh, boys. Just a minute. Don't talk to me, I'm mad. Me too. So am I. Oh! Oh! Oh, look. Oh, it's a good thing I got a hard head. Oh, my nerves. My nerves. My nerves. [♪♪♪]
