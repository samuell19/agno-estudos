Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. It's summer. -Yay! Summer! -Summer! Goodbye, Miss Othmar! Here you go, Miss Othmar. This should get you through the next few months. Summer! Yay! Wow! Wow! Wow! Yeah! Go get it, Snoopy. I got it! Back to school already? Good grief. That's it. The last pool day of the summer. Hard to believe we'll be back in school in one week's time. I feel a stomachache coming on. I look forward to catching up on all the sleep I missed during summer. Sir, a new school brings with it new possibilities, even for you. There's so many exciting things to learn. I'm still trying to remember what I learned last year, Marcie. It's sure gonna be different moving over to the new school. You didn't think we'd be in the same school forever, did you, Linus? What you guys should be focusing on is our last week of summer. Now, I'm going to perform a perfect triple-flip jackknife. Watch and learn. Look out! Well, there it is. Our new school. New school, old school. What's the difference? Aren't you a little nervous, Lucy? Why should I be? Look at the size of the place. It's huge! You can say that again, Schroeder. It is pretty big, I suppose. New classrooms. New subjects. New teachers. Things are really going to change for us. They are? How will we find our way -through the halls? -I bet we'll get lost. We'll all be getting lockers. What if I forget my combination? There will be a lot of bigger kids there. And bigger teachers. The teachers won't be bigger. They could be. I wonder if I'll be able to reach the water fountain. I heard the school lunches taste terrible. At least we'll all be together. How do you know that? We might all be in different classes. Wouldn't that be awful? We'd be all alone. Lucy? Did you hear what I said? We're all going downtown to pick up new school supplies. Are you coming? Yes. Of course. You all go ahead. I'll catch up. Does anyone else feel like the summers keep getting shorter, the older we get? It's like they always say, Chuck. Time flies when you're having fun. It's just too bad we can't have summer forever. Bigger classrooms? New students? New teachers? Everything's going to change. I'll be happy to read aloud, Miss Othmar. You know the rules, Snoopy! No dogs allowed in school! -Hooray! -Way to go, Lucy! I don't wanna go to that new school. I wish there was a way out. "Have a question? We have the answers." Of course! The library always has the answers to your problems. Glue sticks. I miss summer already. How much longer is this going to take, Marcie? I'm almost finished. Here, have a chalk eraser, Sir. Hey, Marcie. There's a sale on calculators. I'd sure like to surprise my parents and get good grades this year. I do all right in lunch and gym. It's everything else I struggle with. I understand, Charlie Brown. My parents always say, "There's no heavier burden than great potential." Hey! Watch it! You poor, misguided people. Lucy, where have you been? I've gathered all our school supplies for the new year. School supplies? I'm not going to need any of that, Linus. I've just discovered a great secret in the library. I won't be attending that new school after all. What are you talking about? There's a special test you can take. If you pass it, they give you your diploma early and you never have to return to school again. -What did she say? -Huh? And since I already know everything they teach in school, I bet I can pass that test with my eyes closed. Who knew such a thing existed? Why did no one ever tell us about this before? Is this test for real? You bet it is. And when I do pass it, I'm going to have summer vacation all year round. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to be fitted for my graduation gown. Lucy, wait up! Lucy! -Wait up a minute! -Come on, please! Yes? Can I help you? What's all this talk about not going back to school? Are you really gonna have an endless summer? Can you imagine? An endless summer. I could play piano all day. Every day. I could have more time to practice my curveball. Practice all you want, Chuck. I'll still clobber you at the plate. Hey, Lucille. Since you're so sure you can pass that test, you think you could teach us so we could pass it too? You want me to help you pass the test? I don't know. I'm pretty busy. Lucy. Please. What has gotten into everyone? Marcie, I'm surprised to see you're going along with this. I can see how you may doubt your sister, Linus. But if we do get our diplomas early, it sure would be nice to get a jump-start on my college applications. What about you, Franklin? Morbid curiosity. Please, Lucy! Wait up. -Slow down. -We want it to be summer forever. Of course, I'll help you. It would be boring to be the only kid in the neighborhood that doesn't have to go to school anymore. Yay! You know dogs aren't allowed in school. What makes you think you can join my class? My school, my rules. Consider yourself enrolled. Lucy, do you really think you can be a teacher? Teachers are fair, they're diplomatic, they're patient. And most important, they have a wealth of knowledge. You can't teach what you don't know. All right, listen up. The test date is in a few days. Stick with me and you'll have summer vacation all year long. Van Pelt Academy begins tomorrow morning. Yay! This isn't going to end well. -Good morning, class. -Good morning, Lucy! Wait, this doesn't look like a classroom. Patty's right. Where are the desks? And the chalkboard? You can't have a school without a chalkboard. I don't need any of that stuff to teach. I have everything I need right here. Hello, Linus. I see you decided to join us. Hardly. I'm here to stop you from making a fool of yourself. Why are you even so adamant on passing this test? Class? We want it to be summer forever! Sit down, Linus. Yeah. Don't ruin this for the rest of us. You heard them. Take a seat and join the class. All right, class. Let's get started. Science. A cornerstone of education. Just think of where we would be without it. No lights, no refrigerators, no commercially available dog food. However, today we are studying my favorite invention, the television. Yay! How does it work? No one really knows. That's science for you. Isn't it her job to know? She is the teacher. Television is full of informative and educational programming on topics ranging from law enforcement, to medicine, to which detergent will get your sheets the cleanest. But if you're looking for a show to teach you all about science… That's Mr. Spock. Listen closely to him. He's a scientist. Hey, teacher. Are there really aliens in outer space? They just landed on a planet full of them, didn't they? It's time to focus on math. Specifically, numbers. Suddenly, I have a feeling of impending doom. Don't worry. This will be easy. Today, I'm going to teach you the type of math you'll actually put to use in the real world. Bingo! Bingo? B9. The first number is B9. That Lucy is one great teacher. I know! Who would have thought? O62. I never knew learning could be so much fun. It's like we're not even doing math. You can say that again. G59. Excuse me, ma'am. There's no way the test is going to cover-- Marcie, if you don't mind, this is a place of learning, not interrupting. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. I17! Next, we come to geography! Welcome to bonny ol' England, and the world's most famous clock, Big Ben. For something called Big Ben, it's not that big. It's not the real one, Sir. We're at a mini-putt. Here in England, the president is called the Queen. England is mainly known for the Beatles invasion of the 1960s. Those pesky bugs spread to America and destroyed our country's crops. Boy, you really know your stuff, Lucy. I told you this teaching stuff was a piece of cake. It's easy when you make it all up. Here we are at the Atlantic Ocean, where the fearless Amelia Earhart became the first female aviator to fly solo across these mighty waters in 1932. She did that? Is that really true, Marcie? It sure is, Sir. Wow! It's also the first true thing that Lucille has taught so far. It's probably because she read it right here on the pedestal. Fore! Excuse us. I'm trying to teach here. Oh, yeah? Teach this, lady. Uh-oh! It looks like we've overstayed our travel visas! Well, that's it for today. If we keep this up, we'll have no problem passing that test. Yay! Thank you. No applause necessary. When you know as much as I do, teaching is a breeze. We'll pick it up again tomorrow. Yay! And remember, no homework! Lucy! Lucy! What kind of school is this? I have to admit, I prefer a classroom with a stronger emphasis on facts. Lucy must be stopped. No one is going to pass that test with what Lucy is teaching us. I don't think she's teaching us anything! I got an A in bingo today. I keep asking myself, "What would Miss Othmar do?" Miss Othmar… That's it! I can't help but feel like we just missed something. A great day deserves a great reward. Thank you Miss Othmar for getting me this test. You don't understand the risk I took reaching out to you. If my sister knew we were talking-- Miss Othmar? Hello? Mutiny! Listen, Lucy. You're fooling yourself if you think your class will pass this test. You can't cram nine years of education into one week. This isn't you, Lucy. What's bothering you? What's bothering me is you going behind my back to Miss Othmar. What is this? I don't understand any of it. This is a practice test. Just like the one you'll be taking in a few days. But this can't be the test. I haven't been teaching any of this. I don't know any of this stuff. Of course you don't. That's why we go to school. To learn. I'm talking about trigonometry, world history, cartography. Human anatomy, biochemistry, macroeconomics, astronomy, microbiology, quantum physics, the scientific method. I'm not going to pass. Going to have to go to the new school. Come with us, Lucy. Looks like we won't have summer forever. I'm not going to that-- I mean, let me take another look at this test. Lucy, you have to give it up. You need to let everyone know that this absurd dream of an endless summer is not going to happen. No! I made everyone a promise. If this is what it takes to pass the test, then I'm going to learn all of it and teach it too. After all, I'm a teacher. You are not a teacher! This is a fool's errand! Mark my words! So much for diplomacy. All right. If we're going to get serious about passing that test, we're going to need a proper classroom. Lookin' good, teach. We're gonna need more supplies. There goes my retirement fund. Hey, Lucy. Why don't you come to the movies with us? Maybe next time. I've got a lot of work to do. The library's gonna close soon. I better get moving. 11,842 lakes. Gladys West's work contributed to the creation of the global positioning system, also known as GPS. Important to remember that subordinate verbs are placed before the main verb. If 4x + 3y = 35, what is the value of x and y if y is a prime number? I don't know how teachers put themselves through this year after year. What are we gonna do today, teacher? -I think we should go on a nature walk. -How about a nature swim? What's going on here? Why are there desks in here? And books? This feels like a real classroom. I dunno what you did, Linus, but whatever it was, it worked. Okay. Listen up, class. May I have your attention, please? Quiet, please. Quiet! This test is a few days away and we have a lot to cover. You still want an endless summer, don't you? -Oh, yeah. -Of course. Okay, let's see. Take out your algebra books, please. "Evaluating the expressions of two variables." Wait, I think I wrote some notes on this one. This made a lot more sense last night. Lucy? You know what, on second thought, take out your science books instead. "The periodic table arranges the chemical elements according to their properties. Group one consists of lithium, sodium, potatoium." I think you mean "potassium"? That's what I said. The next one is ruby-- ruby-- It's pronounced "rubidium." Is that going to be on the test? Why don't we do history instead? Everyone open your history books, please. Thank heavens, the Mayflower. I didn't read this chapter but I know the rhyme. Let's see. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue? Excuse me, Lucy? That's not what it says in our book. Of course, it doesn't. I was just trying to see if you were paying attention. Why don't you read the chapter aloud to the class? "In 1620, the Mayflower set sail from England, looking for freedom in the New World. The trip across the sea was difficult. Poor planning and miscalculations soon revealed to them that they didn't know as much as they thought they did. If the crew had been less experienced, the voyage would have ended in failure." Stop! Huh? I can't do this anymore. I'm not a real teacher. Huh? I don't know it all. We're never going to pass that test. There won't be an endless summer. It's over. I'm sorry I let you all down. Class dismissed. Well, it was a nice dream while it lasted. I can't believe we wasted our last week of summer on this. Let's get out of here. I was wondering, will I still be getting an A on my permanent record? Say no more. I guess we'll see you later, Linus. I'm proud of you, Lucy. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're in over your head. Something has been on my mind. You've always loved going to school. So why have you been working so hard to graduate early? I'm afraid to go to that new school. You? Afraid? That's not the Lucy I know. Everything is going to change. Do you wanna know a secret? I'm afraid too. You are? Just remember something, Lucy. On that first day of school, when we get off that bus, I'll be right there by your side. Thank you, Linus. I just don't know if I'm ready. Being a teacher is hard work. I'm exhausted. It's the first day of school. Good morning. -Like the hairdo. -Are you ready for school? I slept in! Hey, Charlie Brown? Your shirt is on backwards. I've decided that this year, I am no longer going to put expectations on myself. With great expectations comes failure. So naturally, without any expectations comes-- Success! I like that, Charlie Brown. I like that. I can't wait to check out the band room. Did you know they have their own Steinway D concert piano? Wow! I was so excited last night that I did some preemptive extra credit. Behold, the Step Pyramid of Djoser made entirely of sugar cubes. Sweet. Hey, Lucille. I looked up more about that Amelia Earhart lady. Did you know when she was a child, she said she could do anything a boy could do, and she did. She's the kind of person I want to be and she reminds me of the kind of person you are. Oh, yeah? What kind of person is that? Fearless! You've always been one to blaze your own path, to never back down from a challenge. I can't wait to find out who else I'm going to learn about. This year I'm definitely staying awake. Well, what are you all waiting for? You don't want to be late for the first day of school, do you? You said you'd be right there by my side. What I did over summer vacation, by Lucy Van Pelt. My summer wasn't just about going to the beach or catching fireflies in a jar or playing outside until the sun went down. It was much more than that. Perhaps the most important thing I did this summer was learn just how special teachers really are. Change can be pretty scary when you're growing up, but that's where teachers come in. They're here to help us move past our fears, so that we may chase our dreams. Teachers do more than just read a lot of books and know a lot of facts. They give every piece of themselves to inspire us to be better. Hooray! A teacher is a friend, a mentor, a role model. They help us when we're down. When we're afraid. Teachers change lives in ways that will travel with us far beyond these classroom walls, into our hearts, into our minds, and into our future. So I want to thank you, Miss Halverson. Thank you for being a teacher. We students might not always give you teachers enough appreciation, but in my eyes, you're all heroes. I just wanted you to know that. Hey! Have some respect! I hope you know what you're getting yourself into with this bunch. Hey, Snoopy. It's page 34.
