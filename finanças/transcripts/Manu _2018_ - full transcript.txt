A desire... is deeper than the ocean. It's stronger than the gravitational force. Such a desire is scaled in terms of your determination to fulfill it. If you don't pay up in next ten days, you'll lose the second kidney as well. May I buy you a drink? I don't know you. I'm fond of your paintings and sculptures. I'm a big fan of yours. I have been stalking... I mean, studying about you for a few years. Every creation of yours has agony and grief to it. May I know the reason? Well... may I ask you a simple question? Why are you dressed in black all the time? I said I'm fond of your work. That doesn't mean I am interested in you. That's how girls are, sir. They tend to be short tempered. Do you know her? You would have known if she had treated you in the similar manner. They must have killed us in some time. All of us worked for a diamond smuggler. His name is Rudra Pratap. He would get furious if anyone committed a mistake. I looked after the accounts. Those three men were assassins. He is a smuggler by profession. But he is a man of moral. He was flying to the States that evening. That was my retirement day as well. I went to hand over the account registers. What happened, Ramulu? I was asked to overlook a transaction of 10,000 rupees. As I begged to differ... Call them. Money is a temporary thing. But the thought of backstabbing someone stays with you. I don't have the time to get your heads and moustaches shaved. Hold your footwear. If I hit you... you'll be hurt badly. But if he hits you, you'll remember it. You'll get back to your senses. If I ever see you again, I'll lock you up with my dogs who are extremely aggressive. You breed them, right? You must know better. They can't resist hunger. No, I wasn't expecting anything. While others see the bandage, I can see how much you respect me. They have robbed it. But you have earned my trust. It's the first diamond I bought. It holds great value to me. Now, I'm giving it to a valuable person. They hate me because I got them caught. And, they are jealous of me because I received such a valuable gift. They are hurt. Such a valuable possession should belong to a person valuable to me. I'll get going, sir. Do you want me to drop you anywhere? I want to drink some more. Take care. MANU - NEELA A strong rope, three tomatoes, a cycle bar, some oil and an iron box. There's no pain. It's the only trap to catch rats safely. Rats are quite similar to humans. They are greedy. They don't have to be informed on where the food is. They smell the tomatoes, crawl onto the rope and climb the box. They enter the hole with the help of the bar. They can never come out of it. Even if they tried, the oil wouldn't allow them. The rats are caught here to be dumped elsewhere. May I speak to Neela? This is she. This is Akbar. I saw your advertisement in the newspaper. I'll take your house on rent on immediate basis. The address is mentioned in the advertisement. Be there in the evening. -I'll show you the house. -Sure. Bloody rats! I cannot put up with them anymore. They weren't here until a week before. Where did all the rats come from? Sia. A small island near the Arabian Sea. With the attack of deadly plague caused by rats, it has turned into a ghost island. Which means... the place is deserted. A place only smugglers and dealers would benefit from. Yet, I love this place. The sea answered many questions I had for myself. It continues to do so. Waves don't remind me of the past... or scare me about the future. Right now, at this very moment, all feels good and possible. That is why I spend hours staring at the sea. I'm at my best. I feel my soul. Boundless sky and the vast sea. They teach the pettiness of pain... and the importance of inspiration. I have an advice for every restless heart out there. Whenever you feel like you have lost yourself, take a walk by the seashore. The sand, waves... and their symphony. They manifest your lost self in front of you. The people on this island are not afraid of the snakes. But they run at the sight of a rat. The effect of plague. With this small trick, I'm going to expose the people I want to. -Akbar? -Yes. -I saw the advertisement. -Yes, this is the place. This is the hall. You'll be provided all of these. There's a storeroom as well. Sewing is my passion. I love it. This is the bathroom. That's the shower. All the basic facilities are available. There's pure water supply available. I don't necessarily have to rent the house. You can get that clearly. But, I'm leaving the place. That is why I'm putting it on rent. How much is the advance payment? When can I move in? Like I told you, I don't have to rent the house. Which also means that it's not about the money. I have a studio in the next lane. I have got a lot of stuff to organize. I'll be staying there for now. You can stay here for a day. Once I'm convinced with your lifestyle, we can proceed with the payments. House keys are on top of the cabinet. Alright. By the way, what's that picture on the wall? It looks weird. I love photography. It's my brother's hand. I mean the shadow. He passed away due to electrocution. He loved dogs. I can feel his presence through this picture. I'll take it off if it's disturbing you. No, it's okay. It looks good. In fact, it's unique. Will you click one for me as well? -Yes. -I... Yes! I love parrots. Move a little to your left. I'll get the final copy tomorrow. In case you have any issues, note them down. I'll check tomorrow and get them fixed. I have one request. Keep the house clean. With every possibility of finding a solution reducing, my fear seems to be building up. I fear that I might not find what I'm looking for. Naughty aunty is the only resort to a hopeless guy. The Queen of all the chicks! One can go crazy just by imagining her. Hey, you naughty! Can't I dream of you? What's with the key and the map? There's some message. Some hidden pattern. Above everything, there's a motive. People often ask me why I'm always dressed in black. Why is a cloud that pours black in color? Because it holds water within. Why do some wounds turn black? Because the skin cells are dead. Mom betrayed us and left. Dad committed suicide out of distress. That's not the world a ten-year-old should be in. I would feel empty inside. I am not able to... forget what happened. It took me long to recover from that incident. With time, I turned to art. I started to portray my agonizing pain on the canvas. I wouldn't like any color other than black. The color has a unique quality. It doesn't give away anything. It conceals everything within. Orange is for detachment. White is for peace. Black is for misery. You wouldn't get it unless you wear it. So, black isn't just a color to me. It's my way to escape. Is Neela there? Are you new here? I'm in the middle of making a curry. I ran short of oil for the dressing. Could you lend me some? Are there any thieves in this building? Well, sometimes milk packets and newspapers go missing. Other than that, there's nothing much we have lost. Why? He's my son. Have you rented the house to anyone besides me? The door was shut all the time. But the things inside the house are messed up. A thief would rob everything. A ghost would scare us to death. But, it wouldn't clean our beer glasses and cigarette butts. It's not like someone visited me and messed everything up. All my messed up stuff is well organized. Do you consume alcohol? Get some medicine that will help you sleep. Or else, you can get syrups as well. Pharmacy is in the next lane. Have a pill and you'll sleep well. Those who don't catch enough sleep... they narrate such stupid stories in the morning. Okay. "Stupid stories!" Once I intoxicate her and do what I have to, will she tell the truth or make up a story? Let me see in the evening. Who is it? -Hey! -Yeah, Akbar. Where is Amar? He doesn't answer my calls. He has the diamond. We have to sell it soon. We can't keep it with him for long. Don't tell me he ran away with it. He wouldn't dare to do so. I'll find him out. Where are you? I'll tell you everything. I have got work to do. I'll call you later. Meanwhile, find out where he is. I'll do that. I have OCD. Whether it's a line drawn with the help of a scale or... the lineup of soldiers, I want everything in order. Or else, I feel like someone is messing with my head. I can't take it when a thing is out of its place. But... my life is screwed up. It's like a train slipping off the track. Or, like a city struck by cyclone. What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep. This is to help me fall asleep. And, this one to help me doze off. What are you up to? Winter's coming. I sew my own sweater. I'm here to buy wool. By the way, what's your favorite color? Why do you ask? You aren't sewing a sweater for me. I just wanted to know you. Red. Will you have coffee at home this evening? Why should I have a coffee with you? You just mentioned that you wanted to know me. You can do a better job while having coffee. I'll try. It's been half an hour! I forgot why I'm here in the first place. Did you like the house? I like it. Just a minute. Dad, please tell me where you are. You teased me a lot for lighting fireworks last Diwali. Watch me use them in my favor now. I'm doing a science project in college on light and shadows. I'm collecting various shapes for that purpose. If you don't mind... Every time I touch this key... I remember my past. I just remembered... I have a friend. His name is Krishna. There's something special about him. He can remember every touch ever felt. Pick one key out of these for me. Hide it wherever you feel like. I'll find it. You didn't put the key back. How did you do it? There are around 120 keys in here. They are all metal. You can't even press hard to feel them. Even our touch has a memory associated. It's called haptic memory. All of us have it in us to some extent. Like we touch and feel to ascertain whether the batter is too thin or the rice too soggy. It's the same logic here. It's just that I have a greater ability. Yes, sure. Stop it. Just like memory is my power, knowledge is yours. I'm looking at every door with a lock. With an imaginary map of all the lanes and the doors, I'm looking all over the island. It feels like I'm looking for a needle dropped in the sand dunes by the seashore. Winning or losing doesn't matter to me. All I know is to... keep trying. I'm Neela. I never thought my love for science... would help me kill people. Chemistry is my favorite subject from the field. Colorful solutions. Many experiments and many more combinations. There's magic happening right in front of you. I love experiments. But I can't stand the smell of chemicals and its smoke. I have asthma. Happiness, fear and sorrow. Whenever I feel any of these emotions at extreme level, I start breathing rapidly. I get an asthma attack. I have a small family. It's just Dad and me. Mom passed away when I was a kid. Life was filled with boarding schools and loneliness. I took up several hobbies to stop feeling lonely. Writing my journal, drawing, singing songs, gardening. And, sewing clothes. I would always be occupied with some activity. I have never missed having a big family because of my dad. He would be a mother, sister, grandma... and a brother to me. My Dad means everything to me. Dear! My friend's store is in the next lane. He's shutting it down. I have bought the place. Make use of it. Turn it into your studio. Dad, it has been just six months. You spent so much on my camera already. Why would you do this now? It's okay, dear. Dear, when you were asleep, I checked all your pictures. I have zero knowledge but I felt that every picture had a meaning to it. The world might see it differently. I also saw the bills for developing the pictures. You have noted the amount borrowed from your friends. As a kid, you would ask me for whatever you wanted. But now, you don't accept anything from me. I can understand. You want to be on your own. That is why I bought the place. Discover more about yourself. Dear, don't let the worries get to you. Thank you, Dad. It's a small place. You can adjust, right? His work embodies a lot of loneliness. Maybe that is why I connected to him. After realizing my mistake, I wanted to visit him and apologize. But, he might assume it's my cheap trick to chase him around. That is why I have penned a letter he would remember me for. I drew my version of one of his paintings long back. If I give it to him, it'll express my feelings for him. I can never forget that night. But... God had some other plans for me. Your dress looks amazing. This color suits you well. Is Ravi here? He didn't come this year as well. What about your son? He played until now and dozed off. I'll meet him in the morning then. May I speak to Neela? Yes, this is she. Who's this? I wanted to inquire about the house. Can I visit now? It's already late. Come in the evening tomorrow. What's your name? Amar. Akbar. Anthony. Dad! Their addresses are... -Dad, where are you? -somewhere in my account book. Dad, where are you? Don't leave them, Neela. Dad, where are you? Neela, be careful! Dad! Dad, please tell me where you are. Dad, please tell me. Hey, put him down. Dad, please tell me where you are. Anthony, hold his feet tight. Dad! Dad, please tell me where you are. Dad, please tell me. Amar, shut his mouth. You want your spray. And I... I want my kidney back. I know that you have a lot of cash and a lot of jewelry. We can live without jewels. But without a kidney, we can't. My throat is drying up because of the cigarettes. Before I have a glass of water... you'll tell me... where have you hid your money and jewelry. Or else... I have got... four more cigarettes with me. You think you are smart. But, do you know what makes you foolish? You left the keys right here. As I opened my eyes... Their addresses... are somewhere in my account book. No way! Don't move an inch. Stay back for a few days and return once you recover. I have to go, dear. I'll be back in a week. I promise I won't go anywhere hereafter. Dear, I'll tell you something. Don't question me about it. Let's put this house on rent and go someplace else. Dad never made any decisions without a reason. I got the flyers printed. Give them to the newspaper vendors when you are free. Damn it! There are rats everywhere! Is this Yellow Orchid? I saw the advertisement. No, not tomorrow. I'll come today evening. I have got two brothers. One of them likes dogs and the other one birds. That is why we had a dog and a parrot. Both of them died. One of them was electrocuted... and the other one was in a fire accident. Let it be. They look nice! They're unique. I love rabbits. They look rich. If you find one like this, will you get it for me? I'll put it here. Right beside them. I hope you won't mind. Why do you want someone else's? Why don't you get yours here? Your park bench painting portrays many stories in itself. He is experiencing trauma. While she hides an axe behind her. There's betrayal. The distance between them speaks a million words. His face is visible. She isn't seen at all. I don't know if it's a story related to you or a sheer imagination. Withered tree. It embodies hopelessness. Vultures, bats... and cactus at the bottom. There are many interpretations and many emotions. Just like you, the painting is also an abstract. It is not comprehended so easily. But... when I looked at the same painting with positivity, I could transcend many stories. I tweaked the picture you painted with my emotions and saved it. I have sent you that painting. When a girl is holding a rose, it means that... she's willing to express her love. There's lush greenery all around. Blue sky. A tree with fully borne fruits. The guy is hesitating to turn around. Once you read my letter, I think you'll like me. If that's not true, sit back at home. If it's true, meet me at the mentioned place. I don't know if I have fallen for her. But, I can't miss meeting such a creative girl. If you have something to say, I'm happy to talk. Or else, I'll go ahead with my work. I know it's you. But I don't know who you are. What do you mean? I like your brown shoes. How did you know it was me? You're in a coffee shop, reading the newspaper upside down. And your ice cream is melting. What else did you notice? Your peeping glances. Your nails are as beautiful as your fingers. At once... I experienced my life in slow motion. You're complimenting me already! I wonder how you would react when you'll see my face. Do you want me to hang up? By the way, when you figured out who I was, why didn't you talk to me? It was your only chance to prove your smartness. Why would you miss it? Going by your actions, I understand that... you're nothing like every other girl out there. You are much more than one can notice. For me, being smart means knowing yourself. That's all. But, it's not about ruining my chance. So, when do you want to see me? I'm not in a rush. I'll meet you when you want me to. You smartly hid yourself from me. I was patient enough not to ruin your plan. Well... is your birthday coming anytime soon? You got my address and contact. How come you don't know my birthday? You'll be having a surprise that day. Don't make any plans. What? Won't you wish me a good night? I can't hear you. You're asking me to hang up. Are you trying to act smart? I know that you're aware about my arrival to your place. But, do you know how I managed to come? From the top floor. How do you know that? The steps on the first floor were painted this evening. I think that's the paint on your shoes. There are footmarks in the corridor and on the steps. Damn! I feel I'm really smart all the time. Who says you're not? So, wouldn't you ask what I did in the house? You aren't a thief to break into my house and steal things. You're someone I like. What did you say? I said you're not a thief. You said something after that. Okay. Don't tell me. As it's your birthday, I made five gifts for you. There's a box in your fridge. Get it and I'll tell you. Why would you hide it in the fridge? Isn't it weird? Since I was a kid, I read comic books. I saw this in many gangster movies as well. When thieves break into a house, they break the lock, open the cupboards, tear the mattresses and take away the TV. At last, they search through the flush tanks. But none of them go anywhere near the fridge. That's the last place they would look into. What are these? Touch, vision, taste, smell and sound. Five gifts for your five senses. I want to show you how it feels to touch me. This morning, after I washed my hair, two hair follicles fell off while drying my hair. I put them in a tiny bottle and sent it to you. If you touch them, it means you have touched a part of me. Your hair is quite thick. There's a photo in it. Find me amongst the four girls. That means you got to see me. You're in the center, holding the baby. How do you know? At the coffee shop, I saw a ring on your left hand. Luckily, you're wearing it in this picture as well. My dad loves me. He gifted me the ring for my tenth birthday. Damn! You should have been a detective. I'm an artiste, you see. I notice tiny details... and remember them. Open the jar now. I bought the ripest tomatoes and made chutney for you. Taste it and you'll know I made it with lots of love. -I'll taste it. -Taste it right now. How does it taste? I would be fine if I ate the whole thing tonight, right? So, you like it. Now, hold the cloth. Whenever I go, my fragrance should let everyone know that I have arrived. Like the Queen sends her accomplices before her. Likewise, as I return, I leave my fragrance behind. Like the rain leaves water droplets on the leaves. Two things define the beauty of a woman. Character and fragrance. I found this concoction when I was 16. Around 50 people must have asked me about how I invented it. I didn't share it with anybody. Today, I'm sending it to you. Ask me how did I do it. Tell me. Put six jasmines in camphor water for seven nights. Leave it in the dark and take it out after a week. Mix four sandalwood drops. Shake it thrice and sprinkle it on your clothes. This perfume lasts for three months. With time, the smell slowly changes. You won't tell anyone. I won't tell if you give me a bottle. Done. But I'll give it when you least expect it. You're beginning to fall for me. Like earlier, you're not finding excuses to hang up. You say "please" when I ask you to. You eat my chutney when I want you to. Anyways, what's this cassette? At first, I wanted to sing a song for you. I sat down to pen the lyrics. I looked for words and they seemed to be hiding. Like the moon hides behind the clouds. But every time I think of you, a symphony haunts me from within. Like how a pulled string vibrates all day. Only I can hear that symphony. I worked hard to make that symphony echo in my voice. Don't curse me. And don't laugh if it is not good. Play it. I'm not someone who buys gifts for special occasions. I prefer doing something personal for them. These gifts may not be beautiful. But they will be cherished forever. Definitely! Pardon me in case I didn't live up to your expectations. I can't compliment you and your gifts. But I can tell you one thing. No one ever gave me such beautiful gifts. I'll not let anyone gift me either. Diwali is in two days. Be ready for another surprise. I can't hear you. Let it be. This feels nice. It is like a fantasy. It is said that on the evening of Diwali, Goddess Lakshmi herself knocks at our door. Are you upset that I'm not showing you my face? Our eyes are right beside one another. They never look at each other. But... they see the same image together. We are not looking at each other at once. But, both of us are looking at the same thing. -That's love. -That's love. I'm hiding my face and fooling around with you. How can you still be so patient? Desires are compared to horses. If we let the horse take over, we'll be crushed. But if we mount the horse, it's a journey. I love the journey. When you get emotionally involved, even feathers feel as heavy as a boulder. Sugar is always enjoyed. But once it's in our blood, it creates chaos. According to me, out of all the emotions, love is the strongest. That is why I keep it limited. Even at this moment, I want to see you. I want to feel you. I can't sing like you... or make smart plans like you. I can't do it. My dad gave me this. He made this for me on my fifth birthday. When my house was burning down, I risked my life and went in only for this. From now onwards, it is yours. This happens when I'm anxious. That's all. Sometimes, she gives clues intentionally. Then, she forgets things for real. There's a possibility this is just a random paper. But my instincts state otherwise. I'll go directly. If it's her house, it'll be a surprise for her. If not, I'll be surprised. Should I go or not? Should I go or not? Should I go or not? Neela! Neela! Neela! Neela! Neela! A million summers would strike at once. I feel they're fuming the tears in my eyes. Every breath passes through with a lot of difficulty. I came to catch a glimpse of her. But I see her lying dead. We can't take it when our loved one leaves us. But when she left me... Did they run away with the diamond and leave me behind? I don't think so. Akbar called up saying Amar didn't answer his call. And when I'm calling, both of them aren't answering. Something is wrong. It's better to confront them. Hey, Manu. How are you? I'm merely existing. How are you? I'm alright. I have got a vintage lock. I need your help to estimate the price. Can you come or do you want me to come over? I'll come myself. I don't see you around these days. It's the new artwork. I'm looking for some ideas. I don't get the concept of vintage locks. How to unlock them? Where are the keys? It's a 450 years old lock. It's from the times of Chhatrapathi Shivaji. You can sell it for thrice the price than you expect. This is why I say that you have got knowledge. What about this? I have seen this lock before. What's in it anyways? It's just an ordinary lock. It's just painted dark. And you can figure that it was broken and glued back. At first, even I assumed it's a regular lock. Sometimes we over think it. We assume that we're smart and ignore the basic details. When we see a white paper with a black dot, we stare at the dot and ignore the whole paper. The locksmith has shown his skill in emphasizing on what we ignore. He diverted our focus to the front keyhole... hiding the actual keyhole. As it looks like a basic lock, we wouldn't expect there would be a second keyhole. Here lies the real mastery. Diverting our focus from something that looks crystal clear. An earthworm is used to reel in fish. The fish is fixated at the earthworm, ignoring the hook. It is thus trapped. Where did you find this? I was at the scrap market the other day. There was a truck filled with metal. It fell off the truck while I was passing by. In the world of antiques, we don't find the objects. The objects find us. I brought it thinking it might be lucky for us. Can I take it? I mean... I'll draw its design and mechanics. I'll get it back to you. You don't have to ask for it. Take it. Okay. I have got work to do. I'll see you later. -Why don't you stay for a while? -Like I told you, it's a new artwork. Thanks, man. Is this Neela? This is Manu. No way! This must be a coincidence. I haven't mentioned my name anywhere. There's no chance he would know my name. Tell me. I saw your advertisement in the newspaper. I called to find out if your house was still available. Don't consider if I'm a family man or a bachelor. I'll look after your house better than you. Meet me tomorrow at ten in the morning. I have seen you before. Yes, the other day at the bar. Sorry. I got to know the truth later. It's okay. Girls these days are short tempered. I like the house. What's the rent? Stay here for the night. I'll come back tomorrow. Once I'm okay with your lifestyle, we can proceed with the payments. Why do you keep hanging up the phone? Don't hang up on me. I am really irritated. How long do you want me to wait? It's been three years since you left. Our son keeps asking for you. What do I tell him? You talk like you're the only one working hard. You hang up for petty things. I am warning you! Don't you dare hang up on me again. It's nothing like that. There's a lot of work going around. I somehow feel doubtful about this. You're new here, right? Yes. -Sorry for bothering you at this time. -It's okay. The only thing he lost and God gifted me... is this key. I still feel the dampness of her sweat on me. Only after you wake up, you'll experience Hell. How did you die? No matter how hard I try, I can't get myself to draw his eyes. You have killed two people. You don't have to take up this freight. Leave him to me. Do you have a mosquito coil or bug spray at home? We're dead. You don't have asthma anymore. Untie him. Do you know the meaning of your name? I remember my dad telling me once. It means the first ever human. Great deluge, boat, veda. I heard he saved them all. The name has got another meaning. "Manu" means sustenance of life. Back when I used to make perfumes, I would drop the bottles, breaking them. But, even after a long period of time, their fragrance would remain as it is. I don't know if the fragrance was in anguish for ruining it... or was feeling gratitude for giving life to it. Yet, the fragrance remained. Some of the fragrances would last for six months. When a few things create such magic, you start believing in miracles. When he loves or seeks revenge from someone, how intense would that feeling be? By the way, what did you do with the three corpses? Hold on. You said I killed two people earlier. How did you know that I didn't kill the third? I know... I wondered how you could be so smart. I tied rocks to the three corpses, and dumped them in the well behind the sugarcane field. That reminds me. What about our corpses? I guess you didn't get one last glimpse of your father. So... I feel there's still life in them. Art itself is... instilling life. As you extract all the blood from the body and inject formaldehyde, all the organs get preserved for a long time. Honey is a natural preservative. It prevents the skin from decaying. Only black defines my entire life. That is why I made it a part of my death as well. In death, there's no right or wrong. It's a holy temple. That is why I adorned them. Life that changes in the blink of an eye is transient. Love that is beyond life and death is eternal. I welcome you from transitory to eternity, Neela. Our revenge is sought. We have come together. Why are we still stuck here? It's for the diamond in your dad's hand. Three of them killed your dad. Showing me the diamond, he said... "Such a valuable possession should belong to a person valuable to me." MANU - NEELA From a drop of water to a grain of sand. From the source of life to the ashes burnt. The cause behind every occurrence is karma. If your intentions are good, karma liberates you. In case it's bad, it enslaves you.
