- Hi, I'm Charles Band and I thought a little explanation about the history of "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank" is in order. I think a lot of you probably don't know I made this movie as I tried to erase it over the years. But a lot of the story is actually in my book, "Confessions of a Puppetmaster," so I figured, well, in case you're watching "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank," you should hear the story a bit before you roll film. So it was the early 70s, I was 22. We had come back to the United States from Europe. We grew up in Italy and my dad fell on hard times. He made a lot of movies in the 60s up to 70, 71. Then things didn't work out for him so he came back with no money, but, you know, I grew up on a movie set so I kind of knew that part of it and I was dying to make my first horror movie. That's all I wanted to do was make a horror movie and I became very friendly with a fellow named Frank Ray Perilli. Frankie Ray at the time was a pretty well known exploitation script writer. He had movies out like "The Doberman Gang," a bunch of Doberman Pinchers that robbed a bank. And he was also Lenny Bruce's partner for many years. His whole background was burlesque and he was a stand up comedian. And I just loved the guy. He was my kind of bizarre guide into Hollywood, having not grown up here. I grew up in Rome. So here I am, a young kid sort of being brought around town by Frankie. At that time, he was probably 50. And he was definitely an amazing guy and full of funny stories. And he knew how badly I wanted to make my first horror movie, but I had zero money. Anyway, somehow, because I've been pretty entrepreneurial, I invented a gift item business and that's in the book. I don't wanna bore you with it now. But I got very lucky and this business I sort of invented took off and suddenly I made a ton of money. I mean, relative to the times, and I had just enough money to make my first film. And I had a number of different horror ideas in mind, different stories, but Frankie, who was very convincing and I loved the guy, he goes, "You know, Charlie, there's a movie coming out in about a month. It's called 'The Last Tango in Paris' with Marlon Brando. It's gonna be a huge hit. Instead of making this horror movie thing, why don't you put that to the side? Let's make like a send up, you know, like a comedy of sort of making fun of 'Last Tango in Paris.' I got this fellow, he's an actor, he's named Michael Pataki. He does a great Brando impression. Let's make 'The Last Foxtrot in Burbank.'" And I'm thinking, oh my God, sounds like a terrible idea. But he convinced me somehow to make this movie, you know, which was not the plan and not what I wanted to do, but, you know, he was, again, so charming and his ideas were so funny, at least as we talked about 'em over too much wine. I thought, you know, maybe we can make this comedy, this satire called "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank," and in fact, Michael Pataki did a fantastic Brando. So I would say that if you're gonna watch "Last Foxtrot in Burbank," you may wanna see "Last Tango in Paris" 'cause pretty much scene for scene, we're making fun of a movie and if you don't have the reference, if you've not seen "Last Tango," this movie will be even more absurdly ridiculous. So I decided to make it and we got busy doing all the things I was yearning to do but for the wrong movie. So what happened was we shot the movie. I kind of had this marketing thing going on. Another fellow at the time convinced me the only way to make money is to take the movie out and four wall it, means rent the movie theater or theaters plural and screen it and collect the money and you could make a lot of money that way and do a premiere in Hollywood. So, you know, here I was, I already made the movie, we were finishing it and I was convinced to basically spend more money on a fancy Hollywood premiere and invite people and klieg lights and make a big deal out of "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank." So I rented two theaters. They were some of the best theaters in town at the time, Pacific Theatres. One in Hollywood and one in Westwood. We did a premiere that Friday night, I think it was like six o'clock or something like that, and hundreds of people showed up 'cause it was free and we had booze and we had klieg lights. Dustin Hoffman showed up and some other celebrities at the time. And I sat and watched this movie with an audience and I just knew this thing was just not gonna work. I didn't know if it was funny 'cause I knew Frankie and he made me laugh or if in fact for someone who had never seen "Last Foxtrot" or "Last Tango," rather, it would be really bad. But I was thinking, why didn't I make a horror movie? But, you know, hope springs eternal and I figured, well, the math is great, 'cause even if 50 or 60 people show up for every screening for the week, I could recover the rental of the movie theater and make a few bucks. Plus the place was full. Of course it was a free screening, the premiere, so it was all about the next showing, which I think was the eight o'clock, something like the eight o'clock. And we sat there after everybody left and the eight o'clock came and went and there were five people in the audience and this theater held 900 people. Five. And I think three of them walked out. So I knew it was a complete and utter disaster and in fact it was. I thought, well I have no more money. This is gonna ruin my career. I better go back to Italy and you know, become a carpenter or something. So I mean I had those thoughts. It was an absolute nightmare. There's a few funny anecdotes which are in the book which you guys should read. It's my crazy adventure through 40-odd years of filmmaking. And then I sort of got my breath again. Luckily this gift item business did well enough that we kept bringing in some more money. I thought, okay, all I can do is erase this movie. Erase this movie and make my first horror movie. So I went about destroying the prints, throwing them away. We only made a handful of prints. Getting rid of any PR, publicity, printed material, and I went out to make my first horror movie, which was "Mansion of the Doomed." And as some of you know, I number all my movies starting back in the 70s, so "Mansion of the Doomed" is obviously number one and I pretty much erased "Foxtrot." So for years is in my biography and my filmography, people always talk about "Mansion" as the first movie, 'cause I never mentioned Last-fucking-Foxtrot in Burbank 'cause it was such a disaster and an embarrassment 'cause it's a ridiculous movie. So little by little, the years go by and once in a while someone brings it up and then for the last 20 years, no one talks about "Foxtrot." It was lost and forgotten and it was only about "Mansion of the Doomed," my first movie with Richard Basehart and Gloria Grahame and you know, Stan Winston was my effects guy and Andrew Davis was my DP. It was a great first movie, a great experience. And then literally the summer of 2020, when I'm finally with the wonderful writer, Adam Felber writing my book... They call it a memoir but to me it's more like my life so far 'cause we're rocking hard and 2022 I think will make 18 features. But nonetheless, I have to sit down and remember all these stories. And Adam said, you know, you should talk about "Foxtrot." There's some really funny stories about "Foxtrot." You should not let that go. So what if it hasn't been in your biography for all these years? Tell it. So anyway, I told the story, kind of an abbreviated version of what I'm telling you guys now. And shortly thereafter, as we're preparing this book, Larry Karaszewski, who's a good friend and a fantastic writer, he says, "You know, Charlie, I found kind of through the underground, a trailer of 'Last Foxtrot in Burbank.' Do you mind if I clean it up and I'll do something for "Trailers from Hell" and I go, Jesus, fucking Foxtrot. But he sent me the trailer and I thought, oh, that was pretty funny. I liked the trailer because the trailer has nothing to do with the movie. It was a little set up and you'll see it on this DVD or Blu-ray. It was the style of the time is when you have something so, you know, hard to look at and so full of, you know, forbidden scenes. What you do is you have people coming out of a movie theater talking about the movie and how it's crazy and it's beyond filth and so the trailer was family and friends, you know, talking about "Foxtrot" in an amazing way. Not one clip of the movie, like zero. So the trailer, he cleaned it up, the trailer came out on "Trailers from Hell," and you know, we posted it. I'm sure some of you've seen it on our Full Moon Features site. I thought, okay, well that's the end of that. At least the trailer's kind of fun. And then Larry got a text or a tweet, I'm not sure what, but somehow someone from the UCLA Film Archive said, "Hey, you know, Larry, I think we have the negative, the original negative of 'The Last Foxtrot in Burbank.' And I go what? He says, "Yes, and here's the guy you should get in touch with." So I called this wonderful guy over at UCLA Film Archive. He said, "Charlie, he says obviously we're not sure how good the negative is, but someone 47 years ago came in with this negative and we've had it ever since. No one's asked about it. No one knows we have it, but I remember that title. It's hard to forget that title and I'm happy to lend it out to you. Larry's a friend and you know, you should transfer it and see what you got." So I'm thinking, oh my God, you know, back from the past. So we caught the negative, we sent it over to the film chain we did the transfer and lo and behold, it's a beautiful 35 millimeter print of this ridiculous movie I made called "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank." So that's what you're about to see. It's just weird how time and space kind of conspired between the book, Larry finding the trailer and now the movie was found, 'cause I threw everything out, but the negative somehow survived and that's kind of the story. So forgive me. This movie is, I'm sure it's totally inappropriate by today's standards. It's not what I wanted to do. I made my first and last guest appearance in the movie as a priest. I'm sorry I did that it. But you know, there are moments of humor, so appreciate the fact I was 22, it was the early 70s and we made a bizarro movie called "The Last Foxtrot in Burbank." So thank you and I hope you kind of enjoy the movie and put it in perspective and oh yeah, finally, so since I've numbered all my movies for 40-odd years starting with number one, the only number I could give "Last Foxtrot" is zero.

[speaking in foreign language] [gunshots] [men exclaim] [speaking in foreign language] [gunshots] [melancholy clumsy string music] You are a very bitter man. - Yeah? You'd be bitter, too, if you come from where I come from. I had me a rough life. My father was a drunk. My Mother was a drunk. My grandMother was a drunk. My grandfather was a drunk. All the animals on our farm used to drink. Everybody was drunk all the time. This one night.... This one night, I got all dressed up to take my girl to a dance because I like to dance, especially the Foxtrot, you know? My father made me late because, because I had to flick a couple more chickens. So I asked him if he would flick 'em. He told me, "Oh fluck you." Anyhow, I was in a hurry and I didn't have time to change my shoes. You see I... You see, I had chicken shit all over 'em. In fact they, they called me that for a long time. Chicken shit shoes. Later on, in the car, they smell the chicken shit, you know? Wake up! [Jeanne grunts] - What do you want? Let me see your fingers. - My fingers? - Yeah. That's a nice one. Nah. That's a nice one. That's, that's okay, too. Stick 'em up my nose. - Your nose? - Stick 'em. - But I never did that before. - Stick 'em! [Jeanne sighs] - Okay. [Jeanne chuckles] - Yeah. [Paul yells] You cunt! You got a hang nail! [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [Jeanne humming] [speaking in foreign language] - Yeah, yeah. - Ooh. [speaking in foreign language] Ah. [Jeanne laughs] [speaking in foreign language] [splashing] [Jeanne gasps] [Jeanne yelps] - No! Ugh. [speaking in foreign language] - No! [bell tolling] [speaking in foreign language] [bell tolling] - [Paul] Don't be difficult. Cut this shit out now. Shit, I told you I'll try. God. Eh. All right, it's gonna be difficult. Now will you leave me alone? We gotta talk to him. - [Mother] La pere! [Mother laughing] [speaking in foreign language] - Yeah, will you... Come on, will you... [speaking in foreign language] - Uh, Father, you speak English? - Oh, you speak English? - Yeah, yeah. That's good. - Well I'm from Ireland, you know. I've been in Paris now for almost 10 years. I'm glad you speak English. - It's a very nice country. We're here Father, 'cause we want a burial, you see? - Oh, I see. - Her son and my wife died and uh- - Oh, your son. - And we want to get a burial. - I see. - The very best. You know father, I think, I think I better level with you. You see, uh, it was a suicide. - [Pastor] I beg you pardon? Are you telling me that the deceased is a suicide? - Yeah. - [Pastor] Oh, now that presents a problem. - We wanna get a burial, the very best you got. - Well that's- [speaking in foreign language] - Mass, yeah, we want a big mass. - [Pastor] The church is not allowed to bury suicides. - Yeah, father, I know about that, but there are exceptions. Maybe... - [Pastor] There are no exceptions. Don't you understand, it's the church law. - Maybe you can make an exception in this case, yeah. Yeah, now you get yourself a new frock, huh? - No, no, no. The money has nothing to do with it. You can't... Please take this back. You're embarrassing me. - What are you doin'? What are you doin', huh? - Take it back- - What are you, are you pushin' for pope or somethin', hm? - No, no, it's not that. - Here. Here. - It's the church law. - Get yourself a nun. - Stop. - No, that's for you. Do what you want with it. - This is a very good sum of money, but I'm not allowed to take anything like that. You see, I remember in 1937 just shortly after I was ordained- - You know, you really are a shitty Father. You're acting like a real putz, you know that? - A what? - Putz! - I beg your pardon. What'd you just say to me? - You're a prick. - You stop that now. You want me to call the police on you? What kind of language is that, you heathen. - You wouldn't bury your Mother, cock sucker. - Oh, g... What did you... A little respect for the woman you're with. What kind of language is that- - Asshole. - Why you... What a dirty cock sucker Motherfucker, sucker fucker, trying to break my balls. Ooh. [cars honking] - Hiya baby. [Jeanne groans] - [Jeanne] Hiya baby you- - What's that? What's that? Wet sheets? What's that? You couldn't wait for me, you dirty cunt! Look how much you've come already! Shit! - But my lover, I was here so long waiting for you and you never came to see me. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - And I had a lovely dream anyway. - Hand me that butter. - That is margarine. - Shut up! - I know what butter is. - What are you doing? - Shut up. - Are you crazy? You do this to me? - Dumb cunt, you coming all over the place without me. - You do this to me every time I see you. [upbeat fanfare music] I told you it was margarine. - Oh who gives a fuck? I'm on a diet anyway. [Jeanne laughs] - Are you nuts? Oh, take this butter off of me. [Jeanne grunts] [Paul grunting] - Am I the best you ever had? - Oui. - Fuckin' A. You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? - Oui. - Yeah, now repeat after me or I'll stop doin' it. - Oh no, don't stop. - Say, "I hate my fuckin' Mother." - I cannot say this. - Say it or I'll stop doing it. [Jeanne sighs] - I hate my fucking Mother. - Louder. - I hate my fucking Mother. [Paul grunting] - Am I hurtin' ya? - [Jeanne] No. [Paul grunting] - Say I hate my fuckin' church. - No, I cannot say that. - Why? - I'm an atheist. - No jokes, you dumb fuck. You're breakin' the rhythm. You'd do anything for me, wouldn't ya? - Oui. - Yeah. Am I hurtin' ya? - No. - Would you fuck a skunk for me? - A skunk? - Oui, a skunk. - Hm, oui, I would fuck a skunk. - Good. Good. That's good. Am I hurtin' ya? - No. [Paul sighs] [Paul panting] Hand me that guitar. - Oh. Are you going to play for me? - No. I'm gonna shove it up your ass! - Oh, you filthy fucker! You shove it up your own ass! [Jeanne shouts indistinctly] - Is it somethin' I said? [birds chirping] Sweetheart? Sweetheart? Sweetheart? Hiya, baby. - What are you doing in my house anyway? Can't you see I'm getting married? Go away. I told you it is over. It is finished. Go away. - Yeah. That's that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I was thinking, where am I going? - [Jeanne] I don't know. Just go. Can't you see I'm getting married? - Now wait a minute. I know I haven't got much to offer. I had my balls shot off by a cannon in Cuba. I need somebody to look after my hemorrhoids and my prostate, it's the size of a Mississippi Mellon. But my rod is in good shape. [speaks in foreign language] - You know, my uh, my pee pee... My birdie. My poo poo. - Poo poo, poo poo. Can't you say prick like anyone? - Yeah, I mean my dinky, my do-do wig wham dingalinga poo poo. - [Jeanne] You are crazy, and this is my house. Go away. - But seriously, honey. I'm in love with you and I wanna know your name. - You want to know my name? Mais oui. This is my name. [gunshot] - Are you sore because I asked you to swallow it? [gunshot] Gee... And I thought I was touchy about giving my name. [gunshot] Now hold it. [Paul grunting] [soft jazz music] [Paul coughing] [soft jazz music] - Oh, you give good shoe.
