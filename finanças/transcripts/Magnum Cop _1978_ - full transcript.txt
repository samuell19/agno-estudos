And I bet you the police commissioner sent you to convince me to to come back to the police force... Do you need the "fox", eh? Yeah, we got nostalgic... Then tell the Commissioner that I'm going back to the Police only if they give me half a million a month, for 16 months, like the bankers. Cut it out! As a private person I earn even more.

But this is tearing up our agency! You won't need any more. Because I don't think that the owner would be willing to wait 30 years for you... Why, where am I going? In jail, Spada. Where you will have time to understand that you can't always do always do as you please. When you were a policeman you were a private private detective. And now that you're a private you're going to be a policeman, and blundering around, shooting as if you were at the shooting gallery! Look, translate because I didn't understand anything, eh? Tancredi, did you find this gun, yes or no? I don't carry guns, me! No way, there's nothing! What about it? I told you, Marshal, I don't need no guns. Come on, answer. What are you waiting for?

No, I don't know the name. But he will tell you Nardelli directly. You're welcome... listen, take care, eh? Take good care of this Police! Bye. Sorry, you were saying? That you're a big son of a bitch. Tancredi? Let's go. You're welcome. To Walter... You're better than Mandrake! What Mandrake! I am the 'fox'! Let's go.

No, no, no, look, we'll just have the second course. - I'll have two spaghetti, actually... - We're not hungry. But just once you two ordered a full meal... I told you we have no appetite! Eh, appetite... it's money you're missing! Go Go! Ahh, this one always manages to ruin my day! Tie', you read the bad news, go... - They're always the same: light, - light... - Telephone, - telephone... - Gas, - gas... invoices... - Change them... - eh, bills. For those the Post Office always work! Even from Austria! From Austria? Do we have clowns there too? No, I don't think so... Tie', it's written in German. You don't know German... You don't know English... You barely speak Italian, but what do I keep you for? Hey, Walter, for what you pay me - I know too much! - See? You didn't even have not even the second one, eh? It's my friend Karl's. We have to find this girl that's in Rome. She's the daughter of a banker in Vienna. Beautiful! Nice! Cute! Look at those apples! Hey, and now that you're admiring the fruit ?? Eh, look at that fruit What the... The letter says that this is his last photo. He may be a clue, though. To the soul of the track! Hey, it says that inside there's even a cheque inside! And where is it? Here it is! Look...two thousand dollars! Come, come. Here. Looks like him to me. Yes, it's really him. It's a half a notch, it's nobody. They call him "Strip", he's a "pimp", he works in the San Lorenzo area. - Thanks, eh Narde'? - You're welcome. Sword? But be careful, you know? This, besides women, also satisfies men! Well, then I'll give him your phone number! - Hello, Nardelli. - Hello, bigmouth. Excuse me, madam, how much are you worth? Honey, it's fifteen thousand a head. Yes, but the transfer of Yes, but the transfer of ownership in whose name? Oh, I don't want to buy you! Fuck you, you and that asshole friend of yours! Me? But I only accompanied him! Come on, let's go, this cost you Go away, you beggars! You don't do that with a lady who is working! Now even with the moped! Blondie, it's been half an hour You've been standing there for half an hour Decide. Either you go with them or come with me. - I was looking for you. - And you found me. I'm ready to serve you. Ten thousand. You've got it all wrong, Moretto... Look at this one. Do you recognize yourself? Be careful! If you don't tell me where that girl is I'll serve you! And for free, too! Hey, what do you want from me? It's been a while since I left her. That one was kneading, and beat whenever she wanted to, the bitch! Where is she now? How should I know? He told me that he was with the Indians, the ones that go around with bald heads. Ah, the bonzes. I don't fucking know what they're called. Bravo "Strip", bye. Hey, but what have you done, that are you all looking for her? Who else is looking for her? Not you? Eh, no! You said "state"... Well, I missed the "you" sorry... I speak, I speak, stop! He was looking for a semicolon. They call him that because he's lame, semicolon, semicolon... came again tonight. And why were you looking for her? Why, did you tell me? No! Neither did he! And what did you tell him? What I said to you. But I beat you up... Why, not him? Eli mort... - You go, wait in the car. - Yeah, all right. It's the one on the altar. Hey, I didn't even touch her and she's already fainted! Go, it's the right time. Well? And yet it was here. Where the hell could she have gone? Look for her among the people. But she should have passed me by... She can't have disappeared either! Come on. What a mess! You weigh a bit, but you're worth a lot of money! Holy... Look at this asshole! Damn... well done! But... who are you? The "fox". The Fox! The greatest detective in the world. Italian detective. But you just call me Walter. - But... - But do you want to score? Why did you bring me here? Because a certain Mr. Straben paid me to do it. And I did it before others did it who were not authorised. How come my father only cares about me only now? How should I know? By the way, I don't think he really liked that picture you sent him. I sent it on purpose, to offend him! Ah, you succeeded very well. You...you want to take me back to him? Eh, that's what I was paid for! You made me miss the goal... Bloody hell... Look, just turn off the television, anyway... It's very bad for a man to do the job dogcatcher. Ah, terrible! My father has never never took care of me. I never knew mine. And my mother... she died when I was two years old. I was three months...baby. The nurses, the boarding schools, governesses... do not give affection! Not even the nuns of the orphanage... I have searched for everything what I've missed... in drugs. Me in the apples. I prostituted myself, to get it. And I played around with the greengrocer. Listen, baby, but you still don't get it that I've already seen this film? I've seen them all. All of them! Now... it's Krishna my new father. And I'm taking you back to the old one, all right? And so then you can do whatever you want. I don't want to go back to Austria! Pupa, I have a callus in here, tears don't move me don't move me! Please... I don't have money to give you... I don't have anything... Take me if you want, but don't take me home!! Ahh, and cover yourself, right? That's the only thing I can give you If you'd like to take me go ahead, it doesn't matter. I don't need the body. It is an instrument, for us. Like... like a car for the journey. Look, I already have a car, and cover yourself, no? If not, I'll run the engine... Look what had to happen to me... This sucks! Annalise? Annalise, calm down, on the Good... Good! Hey, are you crazy? Calm down! Easy, easy, easy... Easy! That's... a message! "In case of an attack administer Nauragon immediately". Where do I find him now? Good, come on, now I'll find it for you right now. Hey, the recipe! Sir! The recipe, - he didn't give it to me! - Me neither! Look at this... Annalise? I'm coming, huh? Annalise? Anna... Annalise! That daughter of... Krishna. Tenga. Help! Let go of me! Let go of me! They've screwed me! Bee, bee my ass! Hello? Am I disturbing you? - But who is he! - And what about What do you want! Is this how you get in? Listen, you're the wife of "semicolon", aren't you? My husband's name is Mario Leverano, and not "semicolon"! Hey, but right here you have to come and break my balls? Quiet, dwarf! If not punches under the chin I'll make you become normal! I'm the one Who'll make an ass out of you - only if you move! - Shorty, quiet! And make him talk, no? Where is your husband? And who would ever guess with that...? He doesn't tell me what he's going to do, This son of a bitch! Even he doesn't know what you're up to. If he knew... Ade', let me disembowel this one! Good, that this serene you, you know? If you tell me where your husband is, I didn't see anything. How's that for a deal? He went to Austria, but what he went do I don't know, because he won't tell me. Thank you. Hi midget! Good, eh? Take it easy... But the soul of the best... Let me gut it, I will gut this... But who do you want to gut... I think you could have avoid this trip. A phone call would have been enough. Hey, but am I or am I the "fox" or not? I go to Vienna and "zac" I catch the little hen with golden eggs! Yes, but it's money that goes away! It's money coming, in Beni'! But when do you wake up? Father is a banker! And meanwhile you've spent your last few pennies... We could've paid for the clowns, couldn't we? In two days time they'll disconnect our phone! Well, pay him, won't you? Hi, Beni'! You do the talking, but where the hell get the money! In the till. There must be five or six million. Hi! Five or six million... but if we don't have even the cash box! Here in Vienna my is the most important agency. You can find news about all criminals. You're welcome. Hmm, not bad! These are electronic filing cabinets. - A German company made them. - Ah, yes, yes, - I know them. - Perfect! And with those I'm connected with the police all over Europe. And these are electromagnetic recorders. - And that's a terminal. - Ah, yes, of course. - That keeps me constantly informed. - A bit old, though, eh? Come on. Why? Do you have a more modern one? Huh? Eh... let's see again. And over there is another department. - Another one? - If you come I'll show you. Hey, he's James Bond, this one... Bitte! Well, these are my offices. - You know, I preferred to keep them separate. - Mr. Koper? Ah, sure, in Italy I did that too, on the one hand the technicians on the other the secretaries... Do you know what the only trouble is? Keeping in touch. Keeping in touch with all detectives all over the world. Ah, I solved it instead. And how? How? Guess what... But you're not going to tell me that you installed... Good guess! And... how much did it cost you? How much? Half a million. Not possible... Too much? Little! Half a million of Italian lire is not... But what lire! Dollars! It's not possible... - A little? - No, too much! Say, didn't we have a date with Straben? Von, Von, Von... Von, Von! Von Straben! Yes. Ja. Now we're going. He's been in the clinic for a while. He had a car accident, but he's at the bank today. Ja? Mr Koper? Over there is Mrs Tricase again. Not possible! But it's a real persecution! Let's go and face it. Dear Mrs Tricase! - Dear Madam... - Yes? I just can't today. I'm going out, see? I have an appointment. An appointment very, very important. I understand you perfectly, doctor, don't worry about me. If you'll allow me sit and wait, eh? Yes...do...do as you wish. Come. - Bitte. - Thank you. - Cold, huh? - Nooo, look at me. That lady was Italian, wasn't she? Yes, of course, an emigrant. Poor thing, she's fixated on the fact that her 14-year-old daughter has been killed. Instead it has been ascertained by the police and also by me that she died in a car accident. But she is not convinced, - she cries, she insists... - Poor woman... Hey, you have the same the same colour as mine! Do you have a Porsche targa? Yes... plate "Roma"... Good morning, gentlemen. Please, have a seat. Danke schoen. I was just about to to call you, Mr Koper. We beat you to it! As befits a detective. I just wanted to warn you... that you may suspend the search for my daughter. I was too hasty in my judgment. Annalise came home last night last night of her own free will. But how... Good! We had an agreement, and of course I... Here. Tell me if it's OK. Very good, thank you. Then, at my leisure, I would like those pictures of Annalise back. You understand me, don't you? Oh, I certainly do! You've got them with you, haven't you? No, I left them at the hotel. There's no hurry, there's no hurry. I know very well that I'm in safe and discreet hands. Don't worry, you'll you'll get them back as soon as possible. Is that true? Yes... Well, gentlemen, now you'll have to excuse me, I have commitments that don't allow me not allow me to stay any longer. Good morning. - Auf Wiedersehen. - Good morning. Good morning. Miss? Miss, did you cash the check? In dollars, like I told you? Yes, Mr. Koper. Thank you, Ute. Your share. Ah, thank you. But... That's not bad... for not having done nothing! That's exactly why gave us so much money... so that we wouldn't do anything! It is clear. He wants to deal directly with his daughter's kidnappers. Too bad, though. With that semicolon trace... We could have made a big hit! Yeah. Too bad. Well, come on, I'll take you to visit Vienna. No, no, thanks, I have to return to Italy. Right away? And if you only knew... I have a lot of things to do Sorry, can I make a phone call to Rome? - Please! - Thank you. Zero, four, then Zero six and the number of Rome. No, no, stay, Karl. I have no secrets from you. So you're mad at me! You're mad at me. Hello? Miss, it's Spada, from Vienna. Get me the central sector. Hey! Walter, what are you are you going crazy? Central sector? This is Spada, from Vienna. Get me Beta Prime. Have you gone mad? I'm Benito! Hello, Beta Prime, is everything OK over there? Yeah... OK my ass! Yesterday the the bailiff came yesterday! He sang though, yes? And he played too! If I didn't start crying, he would have taken everything away! Listen, by the way, the cable of the international lines... have the technicians come to fix it? Yes, yes, all fixed. There will be no more breakdowns. Because tomorrow the phone...will be disconnected! Ah, well, I'll leave for Rome right away. Bye, Beta Primo, bye. As you can see, when I'm away from Rome, nothing works anymore. As we say: "arbeit uber alles". Work first. That's right. Listen, Miss, could you... Come on, I'll take you... no, on the contrary, I will accompany you Ute to the airport. - You don't mind, do you? - No, not at all! Better Ute, isn't it? Bitte. But how, she's still here? It was you who told her to wait. Yes, you, Doctor, he told me that when he would see me when he came back, but if you want I can wait. Did I say I'd get it? I don't think so. However, dear lady, everything there was to do we have done, and she knows it. Doctor, please, is a mother who asking, help me! You see, madam, I have also talked to my friend about it, - he's an Italian detective... - What? Are you an Italian detective? Yes, yes, one of the best, one of the most famous! Talk to him, talk to him! I'm sorry, you know, Walter, but I have a lot of things to do, -A lot of good things, --but... have a good trip, I hope to see you soon, maybe in Rome. Goodbye. Auf Wiedersehen! Sir...you must help me, please! My little girl...it wasn't an accident, they killed her! Ma'am, I'm sorry... but unfortunately I don't have time, I have to leave. I'm so sorry. - Let's go. Goodbye. Please, sir, don't waste your time, I'll go with you and tell you everything. I'm sure that after - something will happen. - Ute? We still have time. Let's take the lady home. - Good. - Oh, thank you, thank you! I'll have her talk to everyone who knew her. Come. She never went out at night, she was a good girl. Mother went to work, and she looked after her younger brother brother and the house. Not even on the night that she didn't you see her leave either? She must have come out at some moment that I went away, here are more than fifty flats here. Gina and I used to go school together. I waited for her every morning, but I didn't really feel like it... She was pretty reserved. Her only friend was Renate, Italian, like her. If you want to talk to her, she's the one who is running. Madam, don't worry. I will convince my friend to reconsider the case. Thank you! What is it? Do you want to leave? What is your name? It depends. I call it Gomitolo. It is not mine. It comes here from time to time. He has a cute little face, doesn't he? Look, you were Gina's friend... I barely knew her. Strange... I was told instead that you were her best friend. They told you bullshit. Cheers! Moralist, eh? Don't worry about me. Tell me about Gina. I told you, I barely knew her. Hello, moralist! Let's go, otherwise we'll be late. I almost didn't leave... What? Are you serious? I wouldn't mind getting Karl into trouble about this case. Did you find any new clues? There are a few discordant notes... Stay, then! I'm sorry, but I have to leave. Too bad. Tell Kat, in case she she decides to take care of it, that that Renate gave me gave me a strange feeling. Ah, the charm of the teenager! Will you take me to the Prater? But in this season there's hardly anyone there. Never mind, better that way. Have you noticed that we are being followed? No, I haven't noticed anything. - Since when? - From Mrs. Tricase's yard. Come on. - How much do I pay? - Ten shillings. You're welcome, sir. Down. Bravo! At the first shot he hit the jackpot! Here is the photograph. I ran away! Catch him! Let's go away. People are coming. With the plane arriving from London at 21.40, good. With the plane arriving from London at 21.40, good. Ah, sorry, sorry, I'll call you later. But...did you fight with Ute? No, I slipped. I decided to postpone the start. What can you tell me about this man? Do you know him? Change it, it's not him. Not this one either. Change, change, it's not. No, no, go ahead. No, nothing. Wait. Go back. It's him Good. Fritz? Bring me the 2375 card, please. Thank you. You're welcome. Does it look well organised my office? Yes, yes, but in Rome I had the cards microfilmed the ballots as well. So I see them at the same time with the photographs. It's more practical, isn't it? Yes, that's true, maybe... you know, I hadn't thought about it yet. Karl, do you ever go to the cinema? No. That's why, you never see 0071 Thank you. - Fritz? - Yes? Do you ever go to the cinema? I only watch TV Well, go, Fritz, go. So, it's called...Curd. Yeah, but he's a figure in the underworld. Anyway, he's still a handsome son of a bitch... So, the priors are: rape, exploitation of prostitution, but his specialty is...underage girls. That's it! Underage girls! And you continue to support that the girl died in a car accident! You're the fixer, not the mother. Can you explain to me what he was doing so far from home... at that time of night a girl like Gina... And this Curd, corrupting minors... Keeping an eye on me from the moment that the mother begs me to take over her case. The fact that Curd has... Look, do you know where I can find him? No. No, I don't. But a friend of mine in the Police, I think so. And this policeman friend of yours can't get me an autopsy report? No, no, no, that the magistrate has that! Eh, but at least one copy! Well, I think the means would be, yes. Straight from the morgue preparer, huh? Ah, because in Italy... Sure. Me in Italy with ten thousand lire... my friend Orazio... Ah, that's it! In Italy with ten thousand... Yes! No, it's impossible here. Twenty thousand! No doubt about it. The little girl died in the accident. Why, isn't it so? What do you want me to know? That little girl's autopsy was done Dr. Zimmer did the autopsy, not me. Yeah, that's true, but you saw the body, and with your experience... In this place only degrees, my dear sir. And I don't have any. Yes, but you... Here what the the doctor is law. And if Zimmer wrote, about that girl, "virgo intacta", then the girl is "virgo intacta". Instead you are convinced of the contrary, that she was raped. My opinion doesn't count for anything! Haven't you figured it out yet? Well, all right, I'll exhume the body. You know what the students call Dr. Zimmer? Attila. Where he touches, he destroys. Think no more of it, sir. Goodbye. Mr Tricase. Good morning. I can only give you two minutes. I'm Gina's uncle, that girl... Yes, she already told me that told me that on the phone. Please, have a seat. Come in. That's...my sister, Gina's mum, learned that a few days before the accident the little girl had been raped. By a guy at the school exit. Tell your sister to be quiet. The girl was absolutely intact. Yes, but we are intent on... to exhume the body. You understand me, I wanted to to inform you first. in case you want to revise your... And you think that after twenty years as a sector surveyor can't recognise if a woman is a virgin? Ask for all the expert opinions you want, Mr. Tricase. And now excuse me. two minutes have passed. The trouble is that Attila has also passed... I beg your pardon? Nothing, nothing. Miss? Accompany the gentleman. It stinks. Zimmer, I stink! And this is the confirmation that I'm on the right track. I'm really pleased... I don't have anything else to do, isn't it? You should check with Zimmer. Know how he lives, where he goes, who he hangs out with. All you have to do is ask! Don't make compliments, mind you... Hello, moralist! Hey, wait a minute! What are you doing, still hanging around here? Well, you know, I was passing through, so... What a beautiful car that hall Do you want to go for a ride? Not here. Tomorrow at Kirchplatz. At five o'clock. I got some information on Curd, the one who played them at the Prater. Now he's a wingman of a certain Strauss. Relative of the one in Waltz? Yes. This Strauss is a man without scruples. He's also very intelligent. And so far he's always gotten away with it. What does he do? I don't know, many things... among others is the master or he is the protector, it's not clear, of the "Queen Anne", one of the one of the best nightclubs here in Vienna. Very interesting. I think I'll pay a little visit. Welcome to the Queen Anne, sir. Please take a seat. It's his first time here, Isn't it? Yes. Imagine that! Do you want to put them here? What? The keys to the car keys, sir. When you come out you can get them back from him. - Oplà - Ketty? Ketty! Here I am. Hi. I'm going out in five minutes... Miss? What do you want? A whisky, - if you don't mind. - But you do, sir. You're welcome. Thank you. What is this? The bill. But I don't pay it. And why is that, excuse me? Because I'm a friend of Strauss. That's not good enough, sir. I don't think that in Italy the friends of Verdi live for free at the nightclub. As far as I know also Verdi has never never put on a nightclub in Italy either. Neither did Strauss. The Strauss of the waltzes maybe not, but the one but the one you and I know, yes. I don't understand, sir. By the way, the whisky is on me. I like Romans. How did you know that I'm Roman? Who else could have bothered Strauss not to pay the bill? Ladies and gentlemen, you are most welcome. And always with great pleasure and pride that I have the honour to present a great artist, the only one who with her grace and inimitable class has been able to transform stripping into art. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Fraulein Brigitte! Miss, the keys. Leave and never come back. Here are your keys, sir. - Hi. - Hi. I thought you weren't coming anymore. I had to find an excuse for my mother. Where do you want us to go? In the meantime let's put some music. You don't mind, do you? And why should I mind? I don't know, with you grown-ups you never know how to behave. Shall we go? We'll stop here, shall we? This is the ideal place. Well? Doesn't this seat go down? Why? Don't you want to make love? Yes, but... but there's no hurry, is there? Why are you laughing? You archaeans always need to talk a little first. You young people, on the other hand... We are less complicated. The first time too? Always. And anyway for me it's not the first time. People my age have all done it by now. And some of them even for money. But those suck for me. Beautiful castle of Schonbrunn Palace, isn't it? Yes, yes, But you do make love... I've only made love only once. But...close I always go. And the guys say that I'm the best. And the grown-ups? I'm not going with the big boys. It can be dangerous. But I'm big... Isn't it dangerous with me? Yes, but I like you. And then it's the old the dangerous ones. What old people? Come on, let's hurry up, I can't be late! Tell me about Gina. Take me home. And late. You were making love too, weren't you? Take me home! It's useless to pretend with me! Who did she go out with? With whom did she love? Come on, tell me! Let me down! I want to get off! No! Who were you dating? I don't know anything, I don't know anything! And yet you know it very well, but you don't want to tell me! And meanwhile Gina is dead! If you don't take me I'll report you! I say you raped me! Okay, okay, I'll take you home, don't worry. Listen, Renate, it's better you don't talk to anyone about us. You're scared, huh? Not for me, for you. That little girl knows a lot of things. I feel like we're close to finding out the truth. In my opinion you don't get anything out of her. She's too smart. The only concrete lead is Strauss. You should go back to the "Queen Anne" to retrieve the hook that you threw away the other night. And maybe get a bullet in the forehead. After the warning they gave me... But I'm kidding, of course! I'm not. It's a risky system, but sometimes it works. Provoke the opponent, draw him out... Here is Ute. I hope you have brought me some good news. You are also involving my secretary - in your investigation. - And not only in those. Hello. Here's the news about Zimmer. Thank you. Zimmer has a fairly high fairly high standard of living even for a doctor. He frequents luxurious clubs, nightclubs, and eats almost always at the Savoy. Where do you eat instead? You don't mind, no, if I go with you? Are you kidding? Aren't you coming? As we say: "die liebe nachher arbeit". Love "after work. Understood? In Italy... "before"! Excuse me... Did Strauss ask for me? You again, huh? What can I serve you? The usual whisky? Free of charge, of course. I want Strauss. Ask the pianist over there. He's the one who serves the waltzes. Is everybody so funny here? It depends. I, for example, am not at all. And this is the reason why I didn't like it very much his rejection last night. Ah, but I've never refused anything. Especially a beautiful woman like her. Why didn't you bring back the scarf? But...I thought it was a gift from the house... instead it was my precise invitation, which you...did not deemed to accept. Well, then I'll accept it right away! It's too late... now. Now it's your turn to invite me. What if she doesn't accept? Then we'll be even. But then I lose out. In this case I am really forced to accept. Yeah. I really don't see any other way out. You're welcome. You are welcome. Don't you have any collection of butterflies to show me? - I'll even take a... - Can I have a light, please? My goodness! That's not how it's done! Enough! What do you want? Ahh, what do I know. You should tell me! Get out of Vienna, you're unwelcome here. Hey, and who are you, from the foreign office? Start again. No, no! Wait a minute! Hey, one moment! Let's explain first, maybe it's better for everyone. I'm not just not some half-wit, you know? A guy who disappears and nobody comes looking for him. Here, my dear, if I disappear... it's serious trouble for you too. I've taken my precautions, me, what do you think? You don't scare me. All right, suit yourself. I warned you. I'm warning you too for the last time: I give you twenty-four hours to disappear from Vienna. Throw him out. Please stop! I have nothing to do with them! They forced you to hook me up with the nightclub. Come on, tell the truth! Yes, it is. Stop, stop, please! I couldn't starve myself, Strauss forced me! -You dumb bitc... - No! No! He told me he just wanted to have a chat with you. And he did, a chat... And I feel them all here. I couldn't refuse. Strauss is in charge, at the Queen Anne. You don't charm me anymore. Don't leave me. Stay with me tonight. Why, is there also a second time? Yes. But only for us two, this time. I hope so for you. I recognised him immediately. Strauss is the same guy that kidnapped Annalise in Rome. Can I have a light? - Thank you. - You're welcome. But will you tell me what that has to do with Gina's death? I'm going crazy. But then you must have been beaten up for Annalise Von Straben. No way. I've been doing it for days I've only been beating Gina's track for days. And maybe they saw me also talking with Renate. There's something we're missing. If there is we will find out. You have to find a connection in the organisation. Brigitte. Do you think he will agree with Von Straben? Now that we know his daughter's kidnappers? Even if he doesn't agree... I'm not going to I'm not taking the beating, let's go! I was forced to lie to you. It was their first warning. Don't talk about it with anyone. Until now it hasn't been difficult for me to keep this secret. Since two years ago my wife died I hang out with very few people, and everyone knows... that Annalise has abroad. How much did they asked for ransom? Nothing. This is not a ransom, but rather blackmail. They basically ask for my bank's endorsement for a very large financial transaction. Illegal, I guess. Naturally. It will be the end of of my life as a banker. And not only that. How much time did they give you? I have undertaken to convince the board of directors to sign the operation within the week. Then we can try. Listen to me, gentlemen. I know very well that you are offering me a great opportunity. But I must warn you that I will only accept it on one condition. That you take care only of my daughter. I'm not interested in bringing the kidnappers to justice. And you don't should care either. Is this possible? If you want it that way... I want it this way. You're welcome. Ah, sorry. Thank you, dear. How come you choose the Savoy? Because I was told that it's the best restaurant in Vienna. Frequented by important people. You know, I'm worldly. - Excuse me. - You're welcome. Tell me a little about yourself, Walter. I was born back in 1943, in the Bronx, my parents were from the deep south, and it was hard at first... Come on, stop it, be serious, please! And why should I be serious? True and interesting there is nothing to to tell in my life. How many women have you loved before you met me? Darling... and this is already a question in the first year of marriage! You're right, but it's I'm curious too. Sir, you're wanted on the phone. -Me? - Who could it be? - He didn't say. If you would like to sit down... May I? Ready? Ready! - What's the joke! - I don't know, sir. It was a customer. What is his name? He said it was a friend of his. Dr. Zimmer. Really well attended, this place! Don't you agree? I couldn't hear you sorry... I'm not feeling very well. We made a lot of love today... You're pretty pale, in fact. Do you want us to leave? No, no, no! Sorry, honey, I'll just be a moment. Can I start serving? No, let's wait for the lady. Look, the lady has left the premises. Alone? No, she went out with Dr. Zimmer. Holy shit! That way! - "Who is it?" - It's Walter. - "What do you want?" - Come quickly, at the exit of the subway of... Karlsplatz. When you arrive honk the horn, and stay with the engine running. Go, start! What happened? Everything! Everything happened! It's the same band, confirmed. - And how did you find out? - Tonight. I arranged for Brigitte to meet with Zimmer, and they betrayed each other. Now we just have to... No! For now there is only one thing left to do. - To go to sleep... - Don't you understand? They took Zimmer out, tried to kill me! And by now they will have... also killed Brigitte. And you still think about sleeping And if they killed Brigitte too, what else can we do? I don't know, we could try... But who do you want to look for... They have eliminated everyone. They left us on our asses. There's no one left who can lead us to them. - Or maybe... - Might as well go to bed. As I say. Someone is still there. Let go of me, or I'll scream! Go ahead and scream. Let go, you're hurting me! Do you realize that Gina was killed or not! Gina died in an accident. An accident, do you understand? Ate said so. Look, Renate, tell me what you know. Otherwise they'll kill you too. Only later did I learn that many girls my age had the same same experiences as me. Brigitte is a woman bad, she scares me. And yet... When I first I first saw her, she seemed like a goddess. She was beautiful, all dressed in white. She got out of the car, passed me. and went into a jewelry store. I knew that I would late for school, but I was fascinated, and I couldn't couldn't take my eyes off of it. There are no women as beautiful like her in my neighborhood, or even jewellery shops. She was the one who attacked. She spoke to me as a friend, if I liked jewellery and why I wasn't in school. The word "school" brought me back to reality. I was terribly late. Brigitte suggested to accompany me. The caretaker merely said to me: "It's late, go home". And then Brigitte invited me to her house. It all started like this. He used to come and pick me up from school. Little by little, he got to know almost almost all of my classmates. One day she asked me for me to introduce her to Gina. And did they see each other again afterwards? Only once, Brigitte told me. When? The day Gina died. Brigitte told me that she tried it with her too, but Gina got scared and ran away. What did she want from you today? To know if I had talked with someone about Gina. He was referring to you. He also slapped me in the face. And what did you reply? That I hadn't spoken to anyone, but I don't think believed me. She was so furious... Do you know these? No. Who are they? Their names are Strauss and Curd. Do these names mean anything to you? No. But...where did these meetings take place? these meetings took place? I don't know... when we approaching the villa she always made me hide... under the seat. By neighbours, he said. What does it even does it look like? Where is it? It's a strange, curious mansion. It must be located... in the Wienervald. Wait for it... It's an all-white villa, unfortunately I can't tell you anything else. I told you, he made me hide. Listen to me carefully, Renate. If by chance Brigitte shows up, call me at this number. Right away, understand? Yes, all right. They informed me this morning. They are asking for half a billion shillings. Immediately. I have already have them picked up. Then something has happened something happened to your daughter. Yes, if they have changed the program. That's what I fear me too, unfortunately. That explains their hurry. When is the appointment? I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I can't tell you. We can still make it! How? I have a certain idea. Maybe I know where they're hiding it. I don't know what to do. I'm really very confused... I would not like to commit imprudence at the last moment. Are you sure you'll get her back alive? No. For this maybe I would like to authorise you to act. Remember when in our last meeting I told you that the kidnappers didn't interest me at all? Well... if they do not deliver my daughter alive, I will give you carte blanche. But only then. Hello? Yes? And for you. Hello? At Kirchplatz in five minutes. "Renate!". Renate! No, it's useless, it's useless, she's dead. Renate has been killed. She was fourteen years old. A little younger than his daughter. Because they did! For what reason? He was going to take me to where Annalise is hiding. He gets it now... why do you have to help me? Yes, but how? How? By telling me where will deliver the money. Once we have the money, it would escape us. Annalise! Annalise! Come on, don't start that again! Annalise! Come on, Annalise, don't joke... Annalise... Here is the ransom. Surprise, eh? You gave me a scary...it's you... You thought you had it made, huh? You know I wasn't wrong about you at all? You're good. That's a lot of money. And it is enough even for two people to spend. Strip. Look I done all this just so I wouldn't have to undress anymore, sweetheart. Do as I say. Is this enough? Or does it have to be integral? Whole. What do you want to do... I want to convince myself that an assassin can have a face like yours. Why did you kill Annalise! I didn't kill her, she got too excited, so we had to put her on tranquilizers, but... I want to see the body of a woman up close arriving at the peak of its splendour just because he hasn't found anyone who at fourteen years of age raped her in a beastly way! No... No, no...no!
