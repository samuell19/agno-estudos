(thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) The Age of Enlightenment was nothing short of a revolution in how the West saw the world. It brought new ideas and new approaches to science, philosophy, and art. (dramatic music) At that time, the major Western nations had colonies all over the world. And when the interest of the West was drawn to fallen civilizations, museums funneled a lot of money into archeological excavations to ensure the acquisition of high quality objects. (dramatic music) In many cases, the country of origin got half of the finds, and the museums or private collectors got the other half. Some of the objects from the early acquisitions are still the subject of debates that have gone on for centuries, with no end in sight. Other cases have been successfully resolved, resulting in the repatriation of disputed objects. (dramatic music) Still others remain unsolved, such as in the case of the bust of Nefertiti that has been resting in the Neues Museum in Berlin for over a century. (ominous music) With Nefertiti, was the period of partage of objects, and, of course, Nefertiti, there this myth that Nefertiti was covered with clay. and in a dark room, in a box hidden by the Germans. They cheated the Egyptians. I mean, when you know the reality, and we pass the documentation to the Egyptian authorities several times, when you see that before they met to organize the partage, to decide about the partage, the German excavators had to make a complete list of all the objects, and from the better objects, they had to hand over to the Egyptian authorities, photos. There is about a dozen of photos from Nefertiti, from the bust of Nefertiti, so the Egyptians knew perfectly what has to be treated. But Nefertiti, at that time, was considered, of course, a wonderful bust of an Egyptian queen, but had not the importance and the hype which Nefertiti has today, and the Egyptians have been keen on very other important objects. So, the partage was done, and that's it. (ominous music) Even if the Germans believed that it was legal to have our part of the excavation and leave the Egyptians the other part, the law said that only double objects would be divided, and unique objects would remain in Egypt. Well, where's the copy of Nefertiti that was supposed to be left in Egypt? (dramatic music) Egyptology started as a Western discipline. Unfortunately, it has remained a Western discipline. All publications, coffee table books, are written in English, French, German, sometimes in Italian,, but very little is written in Arabic. So, how can we ask people to appreciate the culture that they have no access to the knowledge of it? With the previous regime of Mubarak, he would forbid Egyptians from going to archeological sites, and particularly the Giza pyramids, on feast days, because the government saw that the Egyptians are a nuisance to the tourists. So, we cannot ask people who have always been warned off, who has always been seen as a nuisance on archeological sites, close to the tourists. They've always just seen the archeological space as a space for the foreign tourists and the foreign archeologists, sending the regular Egyptian a message that this is not yours. So, I believe that this completely needs to change, and, I believe, we'll find more Egyptians embracing ancient Egypt if they just have access to the culture. (dramatic music) In the 19th, early 20th century, it was a colonial past. And, of course, people have not been on the same level. There have been differences in power, it would be ridiculous to neglect that. But the other question is what would have happened to many of the objects if Europeans would not have started to be interested in this kind of collections, to be interested in this kind of archeological research, to be interested in making this cultural heritage survive? At that time, in many of these countries, there was no archeological service. So, the history is not only black and white. It's very complicated. I first saw Nefertiti in 2007, when I went for a short training in Martin-Gropius-Bau Museum Museum in Berlin. I remember that as soon, as I landed, the first thing I wanted to do, even before going my to my hotel, is to go see Nefertiti, because I come from Middle Egypt, the exact same village of Nefertiti and Akhenaten, So, in a way, I had a very strong connection to it, not just because I was an Egyptologist, but because I come from Minya. I saw Nefertiti in this huge room in the museum, this glass box, and I just felt that she was very lonely. (dramatic music) One thing has to be made clear. The Government of Egypt never officially claimed the return of Nefertiti. This is one position, and the other position was that we had now several Egyptian ambassadors in Berlin, in Germany, that say, well, Nefertiti is the best public relation, the best propaganda for Egyptian culture, Egyptian history in Germany. (soft music) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) I went back to Berlin for my post-doc, and I stayed there for two years, where it was just right post the Egyptian Revolution. And I remember how we used to paint Nefertiti's face as part of the struggle of Egyptian women (ominous music) that were fighting many of the fundamentalist ideas back then. Even if (indistinct) has taken her by saying that she a regular Egyptian bust, and, in a way, he managed to get it out in a not very correct way, she has remained a symbol and an icon for ancient Egyptian women, regardless. The bust of Nefertiti is closely guarded, and absolutely no photography is allowed, as the museum holds all rights for the bust. Hand-painted replicas of the Nefertiti bust were recently produced by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, price tag 8,900 euros. In 2016, Berlin-based artists, Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al-Badri clandestinely 3D scanned the bust of Nefertiti in Neues Museum, and released the data to the general public, as an act of artistic intervention. So, why we choose Nefertiti? We assume that it's an icon with its own social power, so it's more like it does represent more the others of millions often rooted in stolen objects, which are now located in the museums of the global north. But most, actually, the vast majority of those objects, be it antiquities and artifacts, are originally from the global south. The scanning process took just one day, but the whole project, the preparation, until we finished, it took us one year. And we had two lawyers even to protect us, because what the museum did, and this is, to us, showing how serious it actually is, but also how necessary that kind of public discourse around those objects, and the ownership of those digital objects is, they were threatening to sue us in an interview, where an article in the New York Times was, and so we were really happy about it. (ominous music) When we heard about this not very legal scanning of Nefertiti, my first reaction was, when was it done? Why nobody was aware about this, and, of course, it showed which technical possibilities modern devices can offer you, but that's it. On the other hand, Nefertiti has nothing secret, there are millions of photos and videos in internet. I mean, it's fine. Meanwhile, it is not really doing damage, and we are very scary with this lightening and things like that, and so, what can you do? I mean, it's not the way how things should be done. (soft music) We thought it's a challenge, and we like to challenge ourselves, how we can get our hands on this bust. The artists use the hacked version of a Kinect, a motion sensing device used with Xbox gaming consoles, to secretly scan the closely guarded bust of Nefertiti. We had to figure out how to circulate the object and not be seen by anybody. So, we put the scanner on Nora, underneath her scarf, (soft music) But there's constant guards, they're changing position in around like 50 degrees around Nefertiti. There, it's like they're doing this the whole day, so they have their costumes out, we observed them, and so we figured out how they move. But, if you take your cell phone out, they immediately shout at you, "No photo." (soft music) They're quite good on this, but nobody expect the scanner under a scarf, so we have the advantage of surprise in this case. And this builds part of the data set we have today. But the other part of the data comes from an unknown source. (soft music) After making a copy of the Nefertiti bust, the artists traveled to Egypt, where they buried it in the desert, in an act of artistic repatriation. (soft music) By stealing her digitally and repatriating her physically to Egypt as a copy, we also questioned the term of if there is just one original or if the decontextualization happens by the museum and by the collectors putting these artifacts away from their context into a museums context. And then it becomes an asset that you can possess this object. They have no utility value, their cultural purpose has gone. (soft music) So, I believe, there should be a wider discourse. Most academics who are in the field, and administrators, they just want to hush the discourse, they don't want to discuss it. So, it's no, no, no, no, no, no. It's a no, no, no, no. Even on both sides, it's a useless case. Ah, the West, either they have it, black or white, either the West should have it or the West should not have it. There is really no meaningful discourse between both parties. So, I believe these voices should be heard, and today, with the modern technologies and the virtual reality, and the replicas, and the 3D printing, and all this technology, I mean, would not stand, really, I think, in the face of finding solutions for this. Like, for example, I feel very bad every time I go to the Dendera Temple, and the Zodiac is in the Louvre in Paris, and we just have a very nasty replica of it. This is part of the temple. So, we should really be more inventive about how we can deal with things. And also, many of these museums, they have archeological missions working in Egypt, so they have interests in continuing their work in Egypt. It's a central task for museums, for the future or still many, many years to digitize all the items they have, the complete collections, to make it accessible and so on. But the original never can be replaced by a video. It's completely different, it's emotion, it's the aura of an object of music or art. So, this is what counts. (soft music) In this aftermath, we were invited by several museums to talk on these topics, and in one particular museum, which I won't name now, they were coming up to us afterwards in the dinner, and were asking us, "Hey, do you think it's possible "you can hack us too? "We want to be hacked by you, "and we will give you some data as well." And we were looking at each other, and we're saying, "No, like this, it doesn't work, for us, not." (soft music) Following the release of the data, a debate ensued about whether this was a hack or just an elaborate hoax. (soft music) There was a big discussion whether our scanning was true or not. And, I mean, we launched the video in order to prove that we were actually in the museum with this hacked Kinect. It's an amazing device, which can do a lot of things if you hack it. We were there, and we scanned the object, and the only question which, until today, remains open, is whether the dataset was purely from our scanning or not. And, of course, I mean, it can be also a server hack, it can be an inside job, it could have been the cleaner, or it could have also been just a copied scan and put everything together. Yet, the dataset is amazing. And, actually, when you 3D print it, and like we exhibited it in Cairo, you see even more things than on the real object, because it's not painted, and you can see all details, which is amazing, yeah. (soft music) Iceland was occupied by Britain and the USA during World War II. As Denmark was occupied by Germany, Iceland severed ties with Denmark in 1944, after having been a Danish colony for several centuries. One of Iceland's first demands to Denmark. was the return of the Icelandic medieval manuscripts that had been shipped to Copenhagen in the 17th and 18th century. (dramatic music) The Icelandic medieval manuscripts written in the middle ages were preserved into the 17th century, and, at that point in time, they were being replaced by paper and printing. And, of course, Iceland was part of the Danish Kingdom at that point, and the capital of the country was in Copenhagen, and learned people in Copenhagen, and also Iceland, that where there, became aware of importance of bringing them to Copenhagen, to preserve them, and also use them to write the history of Scandinavia, because they were the unique sources. And so they became brought out of the country in the 17th and 18th century. Some of them just in fragments, but most of them were taken to Copenhagen to the Arni Magnusson Collection, an Icelander who became a professor at the Copenhagen University was the main collector of manuscripts in the 17th, 18th century, a unique achievement. And he brought about 3000 manuscripts or fragments to Copenhagen into his private collection. And when he died, and, of course, he suffered a great loss just before he died, the burning of Copenhagen in 1728, part of his collection was caught in the fire, but most of it, they managed to bring most of the vellums or the parchment books out, so they were taken into security. But, when he died, he endowed his collection to the Copenhagen University, which, of course, was Iceland's University as well. And so the manuscript remained in Denmark, but when we gained our independence in 1944, a long time later, it was our first, if you like, demand on Denmark that they would bring back the manuscript, because this was our heritage. These were, in fact, books written in Iceland by Icelanders, Icelandic culture, even though the content matter was, of course, common to the north. And this took some decades to debate between the countries, a very interesting debate on a high level of government level, from the beginning, from 1944 'til 1971, when the first manuscripts were brought back. And this was, of course, not an easy or simple matter. It was a great complex matter in Denmark, because bringing out something owned by the government or by the state is, of course, not done lightly, and you have to change the laws to allow that to happen. (dramatic music) The first phase of returning the medieval manuscripts to Iceland took place in 1971, when two of the most prized books were handed over. A large crowd gathered at the port, and there were celebrations all over Iceland. Many Icelanders interpreted this as a watershed moment in restoring the dignity of the young Republic. Because this was a very complex issue in Denmark too; you cannot give away the property of the state, it's very complex. That was the initial idea that they would return and give half of the collection back to Iceland, and so this was owned by us, and owned by Denmark, but it was a legal issue, very complex one. It was not possible. So, by law, the collection is still by owned by Denmark, but we take care of it, and we preserve our part. And, of course, it's bound in law in both countries. So, it's, of course, de facto we think we own the manuscripts. Of course, we own it by, sort of, you could say, spiritually, but legally, it's still owned by Denmark. But this is not a big issue, because this was very tedious to take the manuscript back, to bring them back physically is, of course, the main thing. And now, of course, having them back, we can, of course, display them, we have access to them. So, the actual to have have them in our country is the most important thing. Ownership is not always the most important thing, because we own it all together. (dramatic music) The National Museum of Denmark was established in the early 1800s. It is Denmark's largest museum of cultural history, covering both Danish and foreign cultures. In its collection are parts of the disputed Parthenon marbles from Athens, as well as objects from former colonies and the autonomous countries within the kingdom of Denmark, such as the Faroe Islands and Greenland. We are a very old museum. We have more than 200 years, and the question of repatriation had been a part of being a national museum. So, for example, our founder, Christian Juergensen Thomsen, even though he had already, in the beginning, he had some objects from Flensburg, where, with the new borders, we sent something back to Flensburg, because they've requested. So, we did it already in the beginning of the museum obviously. And now, occasionally. we get, of course, sometimes just questions, and sometimes they ask if we can return objects. For example, some years ago, we had from Maori people would like to have one of our Maori heads back. And we did that, because we had a discussion if that was, is there an institution we can deliver that? What is the claim, and by what reasons? And we take it case by case. And sometimes, this case, we said, "Okay, let's return the head." And, sometimes, it can be for different matters, we need to say no, because, for instance, if the institution, if we can't deliver it to somebody, it can be some indigenous people who just would like to know more about them, but they don't have any institution. And then, they can ask, and then we would prefer to have maybe digital returns, where we can share our collections, and they can easily access them by their own hand. But maybe it doesn't make sense to deliver the concrete or the physical objects home. We had also Icelandic things in the National Museum. But that was already in 1928 that we repatriate a lot of objects to the Icelandic Museum. So, I know for the manuscript, that was something with particular feelings for the Icelandic people, but it was not our collection. So, I just, from my point of view, as a curator, you can see how strong objects can be. I heard that it was more than half of the population in Iceland welcoming this manuscript, so it was hugely important. And, for that reason, I think it was a very nice case that really, that material culture matters, and it's a celebration of how important museums and historical objects can be. So, for that reason, I think it's celebrating, it's actually celebrating the importance of how important physical objects can be as a way of rebuilding a nation, for example, or sharing memories. There was discussion, of course, because it's also a part of our history. We shared the old Nordic worlds, and the story is very important for Danish people as well, but, for you, it was obviously even more important. So, I think it's placed on the right place right now. (soft music) So, it took a very long debate in the parliament to make it happen. It was very interesting how the debate in Denmark sort of developed from bottom up, if you like; that it was just requests on part of the Icelandic people to have back, to get back their own, in a sense, heritage. But we did not get all of it back, because, in Denmark, of course, they had taken very good care of the manuscript, that had been publishing and editing them, and had the academic environment around them. So, the end solution, and a very interesting one, a unique one, if you like, on the international level, was to share the manuscripts between the two countries. So, we got about half of the manuscripts back to Iceland, and half of them still remains in Copenhagen. And we have, of course, a very strong and fruitful collaboration between the countries. Now, the Arni Magnusson Collection has been enlisted on the UNESCO memory of the world list, because it's one of those most important collections, documentary heritage, in the world, and is acknowledged that it is shared by both Denmark now and Iceland, even though they, of course, stress that this is the Icelandic manuscript that make up the most of that collection. So, this is a unique, I think, testament of how two countries, of course, we are a part of the sort of, we have a common heritage, we have common history, could debate a very complex issue, because it's about bringing back something that had, of course, been in Copenhagen for 200 years, bringing it back to (speaking in foreign language), to their rightful owners, but still share it. Because we think about it in a different way nowadays. Now, we are, of course, in a sense, unifying the collection again in the digital world, we are digitalizing the manuscript. So, it's not maybe the main point where it is, but we have to use it, we have to share it, we have to make other people want to read the manuscript, not just because we own them, because we want to share them. And, of course, UNESCO acknowledgements was acknowledging that this was heritage of the world, so now it's our duty and the Danish duty to share it, not at the north, just everywhere. (dramatic music) The delivery of the manuscripts ended in 1997. With the successful release of the manuscripts, animosity towards the Danes, for the most part, disappeared. The manuscript issue created a precedent for other nations trying to get their own cultural artifacts out of the hands of former colonial powers. (dramatic music) We have, with the Greenlandic National Museum, we have this huge process where they would like to have their own national museum in Greenland, and we totally agree, and a lot of the objects were placed in Denmark at our museum. And then we, for 20 years, we have just people, curators, people who know a lot about these collections, and they have this discussion in common; how should we share our common collection? Because it's an important part, of course, of the Greenland story, but it's also an important part of our story in Denmark, because we have the strong mutual connections with each other. (soft music) Denmark completed the return of 35,000 Greenlandic objects in 2001. The process was called Utimut, a Greenlandic word that means homecoming, and took place over two decades. Artifacts were returned, as well as collected information from archeological sites. This Greenland and Iceland model of return has the potential of being applicable in other parts of the world, where indigenous cultures are facing the fact that their cultural treasures are to be found in the custody of their former overlords. (dramatic music) And then we shared, now we have shared our collections of 35,000 objects actually returned to Greenland. And one of the important part of that, I think, was that the politicians, that they didn't interfere, they just said, that would be nice, please would you find out between museums? And then it was a purely historian discussion with each other, how should we share them? We can just share, we are professional institutions, so I think that's nice. And then maybe other countries can do the same, but you need the politicians just to step one back, because sometimes they have very strong opinion, and sometimes it's more for very short-term, it's important for their career, but maybe it's not so important for a more long perspective. There have been some saying that if we first start to repatriate them, that will be a floodgate of other questions, but I think our story, at least, shows that it had been as I told in the beginning, it's been part of the National Museum. We were not maybe 10 years old, I mean, in the beginning of the 19th century, and they were asked, please, would you deliver some objects back to Germany? And we said yes. And there were no flood effect. And we have been asking that occasionally, and we answered that. So, I think that, of course, it's the divide of the time to have this question, and have this debate, and I'm welcoming it actually, because it always shows that we are important as museums, it really matters, the physical objects, that we can access them, and that we can see them, and that is a part of our story. So, I don't think that there should be particularly some new situation where objects suddenly, there would be a lot of demands suddenly. They are there, and it's always been part of the museum history that we have this discussion, where should we place the objects? Because objects have several layers of stories inherent in them. Well, I think, the role of encyclopedic, or, as we also as say, universal museums is more important than ever. I mean, they have been created, basically, in the 19th century, when collecting was going out of Europe and cultural heritage art, from archeology to ethnographic collections to art collections have been gathered in the great centers in Europe, Paris, London, Petersburg, and also Berlin. And also, a little bit later, in New York, in the Metropolitan Museum. These are the five, I would say, most important places, cities with universal or encyclopedic museums. But now we have a completely changed situation, because the world is globalized, not only in London and Paris and New York, but also in Berlin, there are living people from all over the world. We just are receiving refugees, a large number of refugees from Iraq and Syria. And, of course, it gets more and more important to offer these people also their cultural relics. And we realized that the billionaires, or the people from Germany, they have to be confronted with other cultures. They have to understand the cultural development in other continents. And when we received these refugees from the near east, they are astonished when they see, well, you have collections here from the Islamic world, from Syria. They say, "How did these things come here to Berlin?" And the second step is, "Well," they say, "It's good that they are here. "Otherwise, it would be destroyed, perhaps, "if they remained in Syria or in Iraq." And then, in the next step, they understand, and this is the nice issue of universal encyclopedic museums, when we work with them, because we have a program to train them as a museum guides, and after some time, they understand, well, the basic reason why these collections from Syria and Iraq are here, because they are part of a universal picture of the world, and you can compare, you can understand how the Islamic art, for example, emerged from the ancient antiquity, from the Byzantine art, you understand relations to other continents, to other cultures; you understand why men in this part of the world developed in that way, and in other parts of the world in this way. And, I mean, this really confrontation with the world is very much important. Every museum is actually a global museum, and the old museums, like our, the National Museum in Copenhagen is reflect that we are a connected world. So, of course, there are some dark chapters in the history, that's a part of maybe we have a relation where it's been a part of a colonization or something like that, but it's still a shared history. We can't embrace it by returning the object. We need to cope with that black chapter of our history. (soft music) One of our aims is and was a motivation to decolonize those museums' collections, because we believe in cultural objects being in a public domain, and being accessible for everyone, and this is actually the mission of museums as well, somehow. But the reality is that we still have these imperial museums, which were founded 100 years ago, even some of them are even older, and unfortunately, not in all of them, but in some, and especially when we talk about Berlin, there is still a very conservative mindset in those museums, how they deal and treat the collection. So you can you can actually tell that like how they treat the physical objects, they try to apply the same restrictions to the digital objects, which, rationally, doesn't really make sense, because you can share digital objects with the whole world, but it gives you a broad audience, a different world, and I think it's only a matter of time when museums are going to change their stance towards digital objects, but it needs a discussion. And it won't be just a decision internally, I guess, but they need some more, either inspiration or pressure, from the public. The main motivation of museums not opening their collections is because they wanna cling to their role as gatekeepers, and they want to have the last word on the objects. They want to give meaning to the objects and tell the story about the object, and that is what is really problematic, when we talk, especially about material objects from other cultures, where cultures completely feel misrepresented. For us, endeavor we do also provenance research on our collections, even they came in the 19th, early 20th century, we have to check if they really came following regulations, the legal regulations. We just gave back objects to Alaska, because there was a cooperation of indigenous tribes. They did for two years research on the collections which we have, several hundred pieces, in the Ethnographical Museum, and after two years, they say, "Okay, we want to have all the information. "And they will be doing this research together, "which objects do you have? "What are the records, "the documents connected with these objects?" But then we found out together that there are about a dozen of objects which came from a cemetery which was connected to an indigenous settlement. And, of course, at that time, it was forbidden. Even in the 1880s, it was forbidden to excavate graves, to take out objects from grave of living populations. And then when we learned about that, we immediately say, "Okay, this is something we have to give back." So, there are always cases, at that time, even in the 19th century, are illegal, and these things we have to restitute, and we restituted it. But all the others are out of question, that if we legally collected, and they are here now. (soft music) Many of the big Western museums have been sued by the countries of origin. Some complied voluntarily, while others have been compelled by the courts to repatriate hundreds of artifacts. For example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has lost major lawsuits against the governments of Turkey and Italy, resulting in the return of artifacts valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. (soft music) Nevertheless, we have this objects here legally, I think we have two strong obligations. One, to make open the context, the provenance research and the context, how does objects came to our collections. And the second point is, even the things that came legally at that time, we have an obligation to support the countries of origin, not only to cooperate with them, but also support them. I mean, there is now, in Egypt, in Minya, in Middle Egypt, the city, the modern city which is very close to Amarna, where Nefertiti has been excavated, excavation later, after the First World War, went on by Egyptian archeologists, American archeologists. And before the Arabic Spring, they finished a museum building. The museum is finished, but there's no exhibition. And my thinking is that Germany should support, should help the Egyptians really to finish the whole museum, to make possible, really, and if it's only by providing them with vitrines and whatever, and really to help them in making work a museum in Middle Egypt. Middle Egypt is an area in Egypt which is not very healthy, because all the tourism goes to Upper Egypt or Lower Egypt, but less to Middle Egypt. So, it will be extremely important for this region, really, to create jobs, as museum guides, restaurants, souvenir shops, and whatever. So, this is only one example, and there are many others, how the countries in the West or in the Northern hemisphere, which have this collection can support them, and I think this obligation is very important. They're now doing the Aton Museum in Minya, and they asked the German Ministry if they would loan the bust, and the German Ministry refused. So, they are going to create an empty box for Nefertiti that will always remain in the museum, saying that the queen of Akhenaten is in Berlin. So, even if she stays in Berlin, the Egyptians, in a way, have reacquired it emotionally, and they reappropriated it in the modern times, I'm one to be very critical of many museums, including our own British Museum, because I feel museums should have a public role. I do agree that they should have some kind of public role in engaging and being something that's open, accessible for knowledge and information. However, that's not the case. If I want to apply for British Museum, or the Pergamon's even worse in some cases, to do some kind of understand, or even see the object and work with it. It's not that easy of a process, actually, and often, you're just rejected. So, it means that we don't actually have, what they say, the authorities, often is not true. They are not necessarily open to the public, and they're not certainly even open necessarily to researchers who are interested in using or studying these objects as a way to understanding the past. So, I do have lots of sympathy to countries that want their objects back. I think things have changed. I mean, I understand, in one sense, that these museums, their identities were created around these famous objects. So I understand that there is some benefit to having different objects from around the world in one place, but we also are living in a different age, and power is no longer centered in a few cities around the world, or at least we'd like to think so, obviously, it's not necessarily always the case, but, at least on some level, I think we should try to give a little more authority in regards to people's heritage. So, if economic and political power may rest in a few places, at least power of heritage should reside in every place, basically. Everyone should have a voice, as far as I'm concerned. So, it's a very tricky debate, in some sense, too, because when these agreements were done, like in the case of the elegant marbles or other objects from Iraq, for instance, there were very different authorities in power at that time; some of these countries did not even exist. So, how do you define who has the right? But, at the same time, I think those people who have, the locals who are now in those countries, who want some of those objects back also have a right to ask for these things. So, I think it's something we need to discuss, and the implications of those decisions should be done in a kind of a clear manner. At the very least, museums need to become much more transparent, in my opinion, that they do have a potential useful function in modern society, but they have to engage much more with the public and with researchers, in my opinion, to make those objects that they have more accessible and useful, from a scientific point of view. Because even the basic thing that they say, that they're kind of purveyors and holders of knowledge from the past from around the world, that's not even true, because, in many cases, they don't give us access. So, if you don't have access, then you're not really doing your job, are you? (ominous music) To create now, in the 21st century, or even in the late 20th century, a universal museum, like we have it in Berlin, London, Paris, Petersburg, or New York is not anymore possible. We have such places in the world, I mean, look to China. They are creating I don't know how many museums, huge museums every year. Look to the Gulf region, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and so on, Qatar, money is not the problem. But it's not anymore so easy to really to acquire this collections, because each country has now legal regulations that are much more stricter than 100 years ago, or 150 years ago. Or 150 years ago, many countries did not even have legal regulation about the export of cultural heritage and antiquities. Look at the Persian Gulf. They're building these monumental, in fact, there is a Louvre now in the Persian Gulf, a Louvre Museum, Abu Dhabi, they just got in hot water very recently. The Iraqi authorities were accusing them of having smuggled objects from Iraq now being displayed in Abu Dhabi's Museum. And we've been saying that the Gulf is a place to watch out for, because they are building these grand museums, there are lots of private collections down there, and they certainly could be potential people who might be buying some of these objects. So, we assume it's the West, but we shouldn't always make that assumption. There are other people who have money out there who may be buying these objects. So, I think it is possible, in a sense, but it won't be done in a legal way. I mean, there are lots of laws now, pretty much every country on the planet has a law against protecting its heritage. So, doing it legally is impossible, doing it illegally seems to certainly be possible. So, there's, of course, an enormous illegal market, which is a huge problem; illegal or illicit trafficking of antiquities, of all the things which are so-called Islamic State took out from Syria and Iraq, and not only Islamic State. I mean, this was always a problem in the near east, and not only the near east. I mean, look to South America, there's a huge international mafia of illegal excavations, and this golden items to make trade all over the world. But no public museum really can anymore acquire such things if they are illegal. So, it's not anymore possible. And maybe also there should be a discourse that provides, not institutions, but just regular citizens from Egypt, from Germany or London, discussing this is ours, no, this is ours. This is part of our identity. How can we meet halfway? How can we have this shared piece of history that's part of, maybe now Nefertiti is part of Berlin's identity, but it's also part of (indistinct) identity in Minya. So, maybe we can bring Berliners and Minyawis, and get them to engage in a meaningful discourse. Maybe then, with the people, would really affect both institutions to find a solution that makes, maybe Nefertiti would fly six months in Berlin, six months in Minya, or I think that people are evolving, and our ideas about cultural heritage are evolving as well. And I believe that, instead of always fighting that this is ours, no, this is ours, I think we should meet, because this problem was done by, all the people who created this problem are dead now. We are left with a heritage, as well, that's not easy. So, maybe we also need to create a discourse from the people, and not necessarily by the institutions, because I think the current institution in Egypt and the current institution in Germany, they, they will never be able to form a meaningful discourse on the subject. (soft music) (thunder rumbling) (instrumental music plays) Environment is vital. A temple, a site, in antiquity which we still have today, is something which has been created at a specific time and through the land. The messages of the land, and the people, and the feelings of the people of the time and their civilization. It's the expression, of that crystallization of a specific time. So, environment is especially important for the Parthenon Marbles. The big encyclopedic museums of the west, were established in the 18th and 19th centuries. At that time, laws regarding antiquities were very different from today. And the big museums and private collectors with money behind them, took advantage of the situation to enrich their growing collections, with cultural cornerstones from other countries. Some of the transactions were legal at the time, but would never pass today, under modern laws. Some were downright criminal, both then and now. And some fell into a gray area, which are now difficult to resolve, such as in the case of the Parthenon Marbles, that were taken from Athens in the beginning of the 19th century. Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, removed unique sculptures from the temple of Acropolis, and shipped them to Scotland, where he decorated his home with them. Later, they were sold to Great Britain, and placed in the British Museum, where they have remained for over two centuries. When Greece broke free from the crumbling Ottoman Empire in 1830, one of their first demands was the repatriation of the Parthenon Marbles. Britain, flatly refused. This conflict between Greece and Britain, has been ongoing ever since. The British museum, displays about half of the remaining Parthenon Marbles. The new Acropolis Museum, displays the other half. The missing marbles, are represented by white plaster copies. The difference is very noticeable. The Greek authorities, pursued the issue of the return of the Parthenon Marbles, because the Parthenon is a unique symbolic monument. It is a monument which affects our life, it is the symbol of Western Civilization. It's a world heritage monument, and it inspires people today. It is what we base our lives on, because democracy, liberty of expression, the struggle of man for his supremacy, this is what we believe in. So, of course, such a symbolic monument ended up as the logo of UNESCO. And this makes everyone realize, that this is not just any case, it is not a precedent, it is not just any monument, it is a symbol. A higher symbol of values, and this is what we need, to go on in our lives, inspiration. The British Museum, exists to tell the story of human history. From 2 million years ago to the present day. We think its value, its public benefit, is in the world collection that is held, at the British Museum. That here at the museum, you can come and find, and see objects from all cultures throughout time. And that there's a great public benefit in terms of people being able to come and experience that collection, to compare and contrast cultures, to see objects from their own cultures, and others, and understand their place within the world. So in that context, we feel that it's vital, that objects such as the Parthenon sculptures are represented, as an extraordinary example, of the cultural achievement of Ancient Greece. The Greek authorities have not decided to ask for the return of any other antiquity from the time, of Elgin. Only the Parthenon Marbles, so that they can come back and be next to the monument, from which they came, and which they adorn as integral parts, and where the whole notion of the Parthenon, is building, and sculptures together. You can't have half the sculptures here, and the building there. It is not as complete as we can have it. The Greek authorities have understood, that by now, they're requesting the return of the Parthenon Marbles, actually the reunification, because the main issue is reunifying, the marbles that exist here, with what exists in the British Museum, so that the head is not lying in London, and the body here. We have to make it as a whole, working together. The Greeks will not ask for the Caryatid, they will not ask for the Column of the Erechtheion, even though that too was removed by Elgin, because we're only speaking about reunifying the Parthenon. The symbol of Western Civilization. We understand obviously, that these are objects that attract a lot of attention, and a lot of debate. Different people have different views about where the remaining objects should be seen. We have very good relationships with our colleagues in Greece. Curatorially, there's a lot of exchange, there's a lot of research work that goes on, so that scholars, both within the UK and in Greece can understand, these wonderful objects better. In terms of official relationships, the Greek government has obviously asked, for the permanent return of the material that's held in this gallery, back to Greece. The trustees of the British Museum, have declined that request. They have said obviously, that they are, as with any object in the museum, happy to consider loan requests, that may be received, but to date, we haven't had a loan request from Greece, to see some of these objects there. So that's really the situation at the moment. As you know, there are only about 50% of the Parthenon Sculptures that survived from antiquity. 50% of them were destroyed long before, the arrival of Lord Elgin, and of the remaining 50%, about half or here in London and about half are in Greece, in the new Acropolis Museum. We think that there is a great benefit for the public in that. You can see examples of these sculptures, in the Acropolis Museum, close by where they were originally housed. And you can tell the story of the importance of ancient Athens. And here in the British Museum, you can see other examples which tell a much wider story, a much more global, world story. We think that's, of great benefit to the world. But that's the situation really at the moment, the request has been made and it's a long standing request, but it's not one that the trustees have agreed to. (speaking in foreign language) I'm Paul Cartledge, I'm the vice chairman of the British Committee, which was funded and founded pretty much after Melina Mercouri, then the Culture Minister in the PASOK Government, in Greece, in the '80s, came over to Britain, and made a very striking decoration, forceful, powerful plea. That, it was almost as if my children have been wandering around all these years and they should come home. But of course what she didn't have, as an argument, was a museum. A dedicated museum, in which they would find their rightful place. We all agreed, that there's no point in even thinking about putting whatever survives, back on the original building. But, a great deal of the original building does survive, and it's within eyesight, and eyeshot, of this fantastic new state-of-the-art, new Acropolis Museum. So why did I join? I'm a historian of Ancient Greece. I'm an archeologist, partly by training, and I'm extremely keen that the artworks should be home. At the moment they are dismembered, and I use this analogy, it's rather inexact, but suppose that a painting of Leonardo's were to be cut in half, and half was in Paris, and half was in Milan. Well, it's sort of like that, of what survives from the original building, not nearly the whole, but let's say 80% of the sculptural members, the British museum owns about half of that, they claim to own it, and the Greeks possess roughly half of what survives. That seemed to me ridiculous, and in the last 30, 35 years, the Greeks, the archeologists, have developed an amazingly sophisticated way of investigating every possible scrap of remain, using, as science develops new techniques, infrared photography, for example. We now know what colors were used in the paint on those, in all that fantastic center, and yet, what we're faced with in Britain, in London, is a very, very poor display, which doesn't do justice to even what they have, and in my view, they shouldn't have, what they have anyway. The British museum is governed by a board of trustees. They are the group of people that hold the collection in trust, for the nation, so it's owned by the whole of the UK. And they are the people that, as they govern the museum, that respond to loan requests, or requests that come in, regarding objects, in the British Museum's collection. They operate on the basis of the British Museum Act, obviously there was an original British Museum Act, and then it was renewed in 1963. And that British Museum Act does state that, the museum is not able to return any objects in its collection. So there is a legal basis for not being able to return the objects. But in addition to that, ideologically, the museum feels, and the trustees feel absolutely committed to this idea about, the value and the benefit of the world collection, and that the Parthenon sculptures are a vital part of that mission, to deliver that public benefit. (intense instrumental music) The museums have often used the property laws of their own countries, to justify keeping artifacts acquired abroad. However, there are ways to work around such laws, as in the case of Denmark, returning medieval manuscripts to Iceland, after having kept them for centuries in Copenhagen. The ownership remains Danish, but the loan is permanent. This is understood by both parties, and nobody expects the manuscripts to be returned to Denmark. The vandalism is that, in order to free the metopes, and the sculptures, they had to demolish the walls of the monument. Basically they destroyed all the upper structure of the Parthenon, in order to remove the metopes. They destroyed the triglyphs, they destroyed the geison, and they destroyed all the thranos blocks. But they are forming the roof, in order to liberate the metopes and to take them. Many other travelers in the 18th and 19th century, they took antiquities from Greece, but they didn't destroy the monuments. They dug, they discovered the sculptures, they took them, and they left. In the Parthenon case, they destroyed the monument, in order to get the sculptures. If I dare to compare, the destruction of the Parthenon monument, with the similar destruction, that happened to in our generation. I have to say that it's comparable, with what happened to Syria, to Iraq and to Palmyra lately. (speaking in foreign language) The trustees of the British museum have always said, as they do about any object in the museum's collection, that they would happily consider any loan requests that would come through. And the decision would be made, subject to the object's fitness to travel, and so on. But I think the critical thing here is that, a loan request, makes an assumption, that the country or the museum that is asking for the loan, accepts the museum's ownership of that object. So in this instance, that's why discussions about loans have been difficult, because the Greek government don't accept, the British Museum's legal ownership, legal title to the Parthenon sculptures, that are in our collection. We have lent examples of sculptures from the Parthenon in the past. In 2014, we lent a sculpture of Ilissos to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, for a limited period loan of around three months. And obviously it went with the Hermitage acknowledgement, that it was owned by the trustees of the British Museum, and was returned. So on that basis, we obviously would be very happy to have discussions around lending, some of the objects within the Parthenon sculptures, but it's difficult to have that discussion, whilst there is a question mark over the legal title, of the trustee's ownership of these objects. (speaking in foreign language) (soft instrumental music) When Britain bought the Parthenon Marbles from Lord Elgin in 1816. The matter was so controversial, that it was debated in the British Parliament. After much discussion, the parliament formally approved the acquisition. In the minds of many, that makes it legal. I'm looking in June, 1816, when the house was debating things, and Mr. Hugh Hammersley made the first recorded of proposal for the return of the marbles, with this very specific amendment, saying that, "Great Britain holds these marbles only in trust, till they are demanded by the present or any future possessors of the city of Athens. And upon such demand, engages without question, or negotiation, to restore them, as far as can be affected, to the places from whence they were taken, and that they shall be in the meantime carefully preserved in the British Museum." That puts it beautifully. It does. And so, the British Museum has been the best nanny in the world. It has brought the baby up, and now the baby is prepared to walk, and should go home. (slow instrumental music) It was in 1687, where it was under the Ottoman empire, and they have occupied Athens, and they used the temple, to have all their arsenal for armory and so on. It was blown up, and all the temple was blown up. And we have one Danish Naval officer, who was part of this Venetian army, actually which blew up the temple. And he bought these two heads, and then he thought it was very nice. I don't know if he even knew it was from Parthenon. But even though he did, he went back to the Danish king, and he gave it to him. For more than 300 years now, they have been a part of, first The Royal Danish Collection and then as a part of the founding, of the National Museum. So now we have these two heads, and they haven't been asking for them, and we are proud of presenting them, and this is also an introduction to this, beautiful and magnificent temple in Athens, for us. I know there's this international discussion, but I think at least you have to take it case by case. This is a very special case, and there have been a lot of discussion, is that illegal for the time that Elgin bought them? Or is it not illegal? And there's a lot of discussion. But what we can agree on, is that this layer of stories, it is the most important emblem in Greece, and have been for a long time. It is an important part of Greece's history, that it was for so many centuries, part of an Ottoman Empire. And it is important, and ultimately it was blown up. They're not just cheering themselves, they are, part of the loss. It is of course also a story, that has become an important part of our collection's story. So there's all these layers, if we should make an agreement that we should return every object to it's very own region. Then we will miss all these opportunities to tell all the other stories. They are important on their own, what I hope for is, that we can share this story. I know I've seen, of course, the new museum in Athens, and it's wonderful. Even though they don't have the original marbles, they have the original temple. So, I think we have getting along with that problem, that now there are several countries sharing this wonderful temple in Acropolis. (soft instrumental music) When Greece was liberated, the first thing that it did was to start restoration of the Acropolis. That means that the whole Acropolis, was very symbolic to the Greeks. So the Greek state from its very beginning, immediately gave funding for the restoration, conservation and works in general, on the Acropolis. And this has gone on through the years as the peak priority. whatever else may have come to light all throughout Greece, however, the greatest priority, and the highest funding goes to the Acropolis. Not only the Parthenon, of course, but all its monuments. And it may sound very strange, but one would think that everything is discovered. No, it is not. Actually there are excavations being done all around the rock of the Acropolis, and can you imagine that new material is being found. Pieces from the Parthenon itself, that were sent far away from the explosion of Morosini, for example. We find them. We find members attached in several walls during some construction, and we gather new elements every day. So, the Acropolis is an open workshop, it's not a site which is already, in a sense, dead. Like a museum, which has 5, 10, 90 pieces, like in the case of the Parthenon Marbles, in the British Museum, nothing can be added to that. Here, we find new pieces, and to be able to attach and spot where a little piece fits, it is evident that we would need, all the Parthenon frieze, all the metopes, all the pedimental sculptures, to have the original material and see the cuts and the edge, and where maybe this new little piece should fit in. So it's for the benefit of scholarship, and this is active today. It's good to participate in an activity which is ongoing. And when one thinks that metopes, which were considered lost, because so many pieces were lying around, and now we have them in the new Acropolis Museum, because they were reattached, and we have new material. So this is the glory of research, of scholarship, and this is where it's happening every day. Cultural heritage is obviously, understandably, a very hot topic, and it is something that is always going to interest people. There is always going to be a question about, where particular objects belong. But I think from the museum's perspective, what we would try to say is, that again, there is this benefit in having, these world museums, these places where you can come and experience different cultures under one roof. And the objective is really, that we use cultural heritage, or we think about using cultural objects, to understand each other better. So one of the fundamental things about, what the British Museum is trying to do is, taking outside the political sphere, is just to make people understand a little better, about particular countries. There's no other building to my knowledge, still standing from the ancient world, where you can see the scars of that robbery. That destructive act, to this very day, they don't exist. Some criminals have blown up part of Palmyra, and that's one of the hazards of ignorance and brutality. But the buildings are still there in Syria. We don't have a major piece of Syrian architecture, where the building's still stands. Nor Assyrian, as I understand it Nor Egyptian. The things that held these objects, gone, With the depredations of time. But the Parthenon stands, devoid of its glories. And so, no trustee of the British Museum could possibly argue of flood gates, since it's so unique. Museum officials often state that if demands of repatriation are met, a floodgate effect will follow. And there will be a non-stop flow of artifacts from the museums, back to the countries of origin. But this flood gate effect has never occurred. There have been some saying that, if we first start to repatriate, then there will be a flood gate of all questions. But I think our story at least, shows that it had been as a token in the beginning, it's been part of the National Museum, when we were not, maybe 10 years old. In the beginning of the 19th century, and they were asked, "Please, would you deliver some objects back to Germany?" And we said, "Yes." And there were no flood effect. And we have been asking that occasionally, and we answered that. So I think, that of course, it's the right of the time, to have this question, to have this debate, and I welcoming it actually, because it always shows that we are important as museums. It's really matter, the physical objects that we can access them, and that we can see them, and that is a part of our story. I don't think that there should be particularly some new situation, where objects suddenly, there will be a lot of demand. They are there, and it's always been part of the museum history, that we have this discussion where should we place the objects? Because objects have several layers of stories, inherent in them. The Rosetta Stone, was looted from Egypt by Napoleon's Army in 1799. Only to be looted again by the British Army, a few years later. Several decades later, international laws were signed, declaring military looting a crime. If looting similar to the Rosetta Stone incident were to happen today, all parties involved would be tried as war criminals. I think that, the Rosetta Stone was very important for the development of the field of Egyptology. It was the gate for us to know the language through its deciphering by Champollion. My feelings about seeing it in London, are that it's Egyptian, it's ours, it's just there on loan. And I believe as Egypt now, we should not really ask for immediate repatriation, because we have so many other objects that we need to take care of, in Egypt at the moment that we need the capacity and the funding to do that. But I believe that we should also have a say, in how this object should be displayed, in how objects in western museums should be displayed. My feelings in general about how, Egyptian objects are displayed in the west is, not quite positive. Because I see the west, is always trying to show how great the Egyptians are, the gold, the glory, Tutankhamun, and all this hype of an Indiana Jones film. It's more of a treasure hunting, rather than, how this culture, how people lived in Ancient Egypt. People, when they go to Egyptian exhibitions, they find it very hard to identify with the culture, because the way it's portrayed is very colonialist. And as an Egyptian, I would like to see a stronger connection between Ancient Egypt and modern Egypt, because western scholars, many of the times insist that there's a huge divide, with Ancient Egypt and modern Egypt, which we Egyptian scholars really do not see. We see cultural heritage as as a continuum that started 4,000 BC and continues until today. So one of the other objects in the museum's collection, again, which has been here for many hundreds of years, is the Rosetta Stone. And that was an object that was, found by Napoleon's troops, and then taken from Napoleon when the British defeated Napoleon, and given to Queen Victoria, and it was then handed or given to the British Museum's collection where it's been on display ever since. Obviously the scholarly importance of it, in and of itself, it is not a particularly beautiful or fascinating object, but what really captivates you about it, is obviously it holds the secret to deciphering hieroglyphics. So until that point, though there had been obviously lots of discoveries in terms of ancient Egyptian material. There hadn't been that understanding of the writing and what was actually being said and written on these texts and on the buildings. So what resulted was, a decipherment, of the hieroglyphics script. Which was a sort of international effort, Champollion, the French cryptographer, obviously rightly takes the credit for deciphering hieroglyphics, but there were lots of other people, who we're racing, to try to do that. So, it's a good example I think, of the global scholarly benefit, of these kind of objects, where you have a big group of scholars who are racing to try and unlock the secrets of this particular, and very important ancient culture. I believe that a lot of what we suffered today in Egypt, in the field of cultural heritage, has to do a lot, with how the field has started, by the advent of Napoleon, then the following colonialists who came to pillage objects, and fill their cabinets of curiosity. Egyptology particularly started as a western science. Currently, I think that the field should move back completely in the hands of Egyptian scholars, because they see heritage quite differently. They accommodate social histories of archeological sites. The way they write history, will definitely be different, from how the west has written the past of Egypt. And here I'm not just speaking about Ancient Egypt, but also the Coptic period, and the Medieval, and the Islamic period. Scholars like myself, who are a bit of the two worlds, I studied in Europe, and I was born and lived in Egypt. I try to fill in the gap, and create more dialogue between Egypt and the west. Understandably it's become a symbol of Ancient Egypt, but its history is very complicated. So it's obviously been in Egypt, it's had a period of time when it's been under French guard, and then it's obviously come to the British Museum. So I think as with all of these objects, they all have much more complicated histories, than are perhaps evident on the surface. And certainly the Rosetta Stone remains an extremely popular object, in terms of the museum's collection, precisely because it has enabled us to unlock those secrets of Ancient Egypt. I think maybe the other thing probably to say, is that, there is obviously of course, a great deal of Egyptian material in Egypt. We understand why certain objects become symbols of particular cultures. But you go to Egypt, and there are wonderful, wonderful museums, including a wonderful new one that they're building near the pyramids at Giza, showing that ancient culture. And so it's not quite the case, and it would be misleading to suggest that, all of these objects have been taken out of these countries and that nothing remains, and that they're all dispersed throughout the rest of the world, without actually having some of that culture that remains in those countries. That is simply not true. Yes, it comes back to the same idea that, Egypt should have a say, in how their cultural heritage is displayed in the museum, and in international museums. And also not just have a say, I believe that Egypt also should get a share, from the objects, from the profits of the different museums. Because these museums make huge profits, and I believe it's part of the Egyptian cultural heritage. So Egypt should also have an economic share, in the different profits of these museums. I understand that many of the museums are non-profit, many of them have tickets for free, but there should be an agreement, in a way. Cultural heritage belongs to everyone. Egyptian cultural heritage is not just Egyptian, it belongs to everywhere. Egypt sends exhibitions abroad, which tour places, so why not, we can have the Rosetta Stone come for loan, for a few years in Egypt, or the other way around, we can ask for the bust of Nefertiti from Berlin. I believe that things should be more fluid, and the Rosetta Stone is in the British Museum, but it's definitely property of the Egyptian people, and is part of world heritage. Approximately half of the Parthenon Marbles are in the British museum, and the other half is in the new Acropolis Museum. Individual pieces are scattered around the world, in places such as the National Museum in Copenhagen, the Louvre in Paris, Wurzburg University, the Vatican Museums, the Museum of Fine Arts in Vienna, the Glyptothek in Munich, and the Salinas Archeological Museum in Palermo. Small fragments of the monument, have been returned in the last several decades, by a Swedish family, the University of Heidelberg, and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. When the sculptures are divided, their meaning is often lost. Here we see, the mythical king of Athens, Cecrops, this is on our left, and on the right, there's a statue of his daughter Pandrosus. And this is the original, it is of course damaged. But here, you see a piece, a plaster copy, from the snake, on which the king sits. This snake is very important because, has to do with the mythology of the Athenians, that they derive from this place, it was a symbol for the autochthony, of the people living in Athens, and this piece is today in the British Museum. I don't believe that anybody can understand there, what it is. But here it has a very special aura, it completes the presentation, on the west pediment of the Parthenon, with the struggle between the goddess Athena and Poseidon. I am not an expert, but I represent I suppose, a new swell, it seems to me in the world, of a kind of emotional apprehension of something which is amiss. And there's a tremendously strong feeling amongst young people, of which I am not one, but I'm one that carries the flame, having been brought up in a ex-colonial country, which went very badly wrong, but we needn't go into that. And it seems to me that the relics of colonialism have got to be addressed by a country that is now, very much past its colonial sell by date, and that's Great Britain. Yes. It's had it. It can no longer lay claim, certainly not to very specific things that were plundered quite simply. And it's time, the trustees at the British Museum, who must be very old and creaky by now, shifted themselves into something younger, and more pertinent to the times. It seems to me, they've got to re-evaluate and rethink, why it is they are hanging onto something, which shouldn't be here. It should be in the Attic sunshine, and it should be joined to its fellows, in the Parthenon Museum. (somber instrumental music) This is a very usual case. We have here, an original block, but the next one, is a block, in plaster copy. So practically, the horse is half on this block, and half on the other block. But there are also other more dramatic cases. The 26th block of the north side, and the 27th. You can see here, that the head of the horses, is original here. The body of the horses is plaster copy, because, this is today in London. The tails of the horses are again original, on the Acropolis. The upper part of the next block, is in London, the lower part in Athens. And I mean, this is at least so realistic. But we did it in the museum, for many reasons. One reason was that, it will be seen like that, it will have the pieces from London. And the other is to give a complete idea, of what is preserved, from this so important frieze of 160 meters, from the antiquity. And how we can read, in one way, the story, on this very long frieze over the Parthenon. The continuity of the frieze, is also a part of that quality, of this art piece. The British museum is not like most other museums. It is only like the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum in New York and a handful of others. But you don't need more than a handful. You don't, but they call themselves universal or encyclopedic museums, which give added value to their contents because, each individual object or group of objects, gains by being associated with other objects in the same museum. You sound like a trustee. I'm trying to be very generous towards them, but they anger me because, it doesn't seem to me to be an argument that works at all. There is so much else in the British Museum, that the loss of the Elgin Parthenon Marbles, would make no visual or- I agree with you Paul, absolutely down the line. But if I walked into the British Museum, just an ordinary punter off the street. And I was shown into this gray and lofty room, where these sad creatures are kept on plinths, boring plinths, with no emotional or visual aesthetics around them. How would I link them up, with what they told me in school was one of the greatest buildings, of European heritage. I wouldn't be thinking that in the Parthenon Museum. I would just slide my eyes to the right, and there, I would see the Parthenon, standing shining in its Attic sunlight, through the window. And here would be the marbles, that were once on that pediment. Everything makes sense. It's much more sensual, It's much more immediate than any argument about universality. What does that mean? And then if I come back as an academic, the way in which they're displayed, what the Greeks have, is much more accurate and true to life than the British Museum's display, which distorts the positioning of all the objects. Yeah, there is always something about museums which is deadening. Objects taken from their life source, it's like dead babies or something. There's something moribund about- Somebody can say that this museum was constructed as a reaction, to, the position of the British Museum, that the Greeks, they don't have an appropriate museum for the sculpture of Parthenon. But this is not a 100% true, because this museum was constructed for both, to receive the eventually the marbles that are in London, but also to give a complete idea of the sculpture, and the other exhibits, the other monuments, that were on the Acropolis. Of course, this dialogue, or the claim for the return of the marbles, lasts almost 200 years. But we don't stop, to continue to speak about that, because in a way it is not for us living people, but for the monument itself. It's something, like human rights for people, are the rights for the monuments, to have the integrity they deserve. And because these pieces really express important messages, we think we should continue to work on these pieces, and to study, and present, and reconstruct. And we do that of course, asking the British Museum for cooperation. And in this field, it is done a productive work. But the final target of all this, is to reunify these so important pieces. (sober instrumental music plays) (sober instrumental music fades) (thunder crackles) (festive drums music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (festive drums music) (dramatic music) The removal and looting of ancient artifacts has been going on for centuries. Victoria's armies took what they wanted from the defeated and brought it back with them to demonstrate their success. Grave robbers stole precious items and sold them to the highest bidder. (dramatic music) In the 19th century modern Egyptology began to gain popularity in the Western countries. The big museums and private collectors began to fund excavations with the removal of antiquities in mind. Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Egypt had a lot of antiquities that were excavated and shipped off to museums and collectors mainly in Western countries. (dramatic music) Many of the objects that were shipped off to the West were considered legally acquired at the time. Some were less legal and are shrouded in a legal and ethical fog and they're at the center of debates for repatriation. The Parthenon Marbles and the Rosetta Stone would never be removed today as they were centuries ago. International treaties and laws make this activity highly illegal. That does not mean looting has stopped. It is ongoing every day fueled by armed conflicts and illicit activities such as terrorism, drug smuggling and kidnapping. (dramatic music) Recent examples of massive looting include the way the terrorist group ISIS funded themselves in Iraq and Syria and the looting of the National Museum in Baghdad in the wake of the United States Invasion. When I heard the news of the looting of the Iraq Museum it was as though I was personally attacked. I didn't really know anything about Mesopotamia, or Islamic culture and I didn't have a particular fondness for their art and culture or anything. But I knew that this is very very old and when something is very very old, it's like just saying, when a person is very very old it's like it's everybody's grandmother or everybody's grandfather. So it was as though it was my own heritage that was being destroyed. But what really struck me even more was the fact that I didn't know that looting has been going on for a long time around the world not just in Iraq. I asked myself, how could I not know? How could I afford to continue to not know. It was that incident that opened my eyes and I think about it this way if I could be moved, an advertising person who knew nothing about this enough to actually eventually quit my job I actually quit my job to volunteer full-time for SAFE. I am sure I'm not alone. You know that this could be the beginning of change. (dramatic music) I'm personally not that interested in specific objects. I'm more interested in the context of those objects. So if you destroy the context, then the object often is meaningless to me really, because this is just a piece. We don't even know how it's interpreted from artistic standpoint. Nevermind the way in which that object was encapsulated Was it found in a house, in an ancient house? Was it found in a temple or something like that? So there's a scientific loss that happens when you destroy something to get something else. The problem is that when you remove objects from countries and sell them to other places then you're basically removing the power, the authority that those countries own and people have in terms of their own heritage. You're removing their basic rights I would say universal rights in many ways. For them to determine the fate of their history, often times it is the people who live near these sites that are actually looting these sites. But that's done out of poverty. It's done out of other kinds of factors like war and devastation. So it's not really fair to judge it just simply war. They're looting it so therefore, they're the ones who are actually creating this mess but that's not true if the situation was different, they would not probably be looting. I think someone who's looting the site is often more than happy to be working at an archeological sites as say as a tour guide or something like that where they can make a much more sustainable salary as a tour guide than just looting an object and selling it for $5 or something. So, in a sense that you also lose economic value by looting because long-term economic value think of all the tourists that come to potential archeological sites has much more sustainable kinds of income source than selling an object one-off and you'll never see it again. (mellow strings music) The Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of demonstrations, protests and riots in North Africa and the Middle East. The effect spread to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, and Bahrain. The stability of the region was severely impacted. Resulting in lawlessness and rampant looting of archaeological sites and museums. (dramatic music) Well, Egypt post-2011 just on the 28th of January, 2011 when the police forces withdrew from everywhere, looters just decided that this is heaven. And they were calling each other in microphones, in the different villages, "Come on the police are not here. Let's go out together and loot. I will take this side, this family will take this side." And even in the Memphite Necropolis in a village close to Abusir, full families were going to loot to illicitly take for objects. And it find the women even making picnic baskets for their husbands and tons of food so that they can continue digging the whole time. And I remember then when we'd ask them, "Why are you doing that?" They would respond, "Because this is the government and the government has been stealing it for so many years. So this is our time to have a share." So in a way they were re-appropriating heritage in a very negative manner which was not the case for example at the Feba Necropolis. At the Feba Necropolis because people were directly involved in dealing with tourists and working on archeological missions. When the Armand Prison was opened the goal now is that the people of the villages they went out with their small rifles and sticks and completely protected the Feba Necropolis, which has very few incidents of looting unlike what happened at the Memphite Necropolis. So you could easily see how the villages that were profiting from the heritage protected it. (bright music) The Cairo Museum overlooks Tahrir Square where demonstrators camped during the Arab Spring. In January 2011, while the police were busy suppressing the demonstrators, looters broke into and vandalized the museum and stole important pieces. (mellow music) When the revolution was at its peak on the 28th of January 2011, regular Egyptians and citizens and even Egyptologists and researchers when as soon as they realized, that the museum was being looted actually the stealing of the objects was done with an inside job from some of the security personnel that were inside of the museum. It was not an attack on the museum. And when this happened immediately Egyptians formed a human chain to protect the Cairo Museum. And you'd find people from all walks of lives, workmen, engineers, doctors, academics, youth, women, men from all walks of life, just there to protect and preserve the museum. That was a symbol also of Tahrir Square. (mellow music) In the wake of the Arab Spring, unrest in Syria escalated into a full-scale civil war with international powers contributing to the unrest. The Syrian economy suffered greatly from the instability and looting became rampant. (mellow music) Syria has something like five World Heritage sites UNESCO-designated World Heritage sites. And by 2014, I would say that every single one of those sites has been damaged in some way or another. Some very catastrophically like the Old City in Aleppo. Palmyra obviously later on when it was taken over by ISIS suffered significant damage. But every one of them, every single one of those sites has suffered some form of damage as a result of the conflict. But then we also began to hear from quite early on another type of damage and that is associated with looting. That was the other major problem for us. Most people may not know this, but every Syrian knows this. They know that they live either on top of an archeological site, right next door to an archeological site or within a stone's throw of an archeological site. So for us Syrians, we know this. And so it's not difficult. They don't have to go and find an archeological site it's usually right in front of them they're aware of it, they're familiar with it and so when they have no other means of providing for their families, they turn back to this time-honored tradition of going and digging in those sites to see if they find something they can sell. Now we refer to this as subsistence looting. And this is probably one of the commonest forms of looting that was beginning to take place from as early as 2012. Of course, there's also the more standard type of looting and that is the organized crime type of looting. This is where you have local mafias or local gangs who traditionally also practice looting, have looted sites before. The net result of these factors is that looting escalates to exponentially becomes an enormous problem and one of the first sites that we see this and was made public, was the site of Apamea. It's a Hellenistic and Islamic site, a very important one. And if you look at the satellite imagery from Google Earth taken in 2011, okay. You see the site looks normal like it did in 2010. And then you take a look at the same image taken in 2012 and it looks like Swiss cheese. And the same again was repeated in so many other sites in Duraropos near Doraso in the east in Mari and many of the mentors all of these began to be looted systematically. In the beginning, looting was done by outside professional looters. When the war was happening, making a living became difficult and the locals started looting as well. In some parts of the country where ISIS was in control, they encouraged this. They realized that this was a financial resource. As long as money was flowing, it was good for ISIS because they taxed the looting. Educated people knew that this was wrong and damaging but could do little to stop it. The only thing to do was observe and pass information onto the International Community hoping they would apply pressure to win the conflict, to put an end to ISIS and the looting. (mellow music) Yeah and I think it was obviously very shocking and depressing to someone who is concerned deeply about the history of the region. I can't say I predicted this but I can say that I wasn't too surprised that we would get to this point in the history of the region. I think after 2003 it was very clear to me the region was gonna go in an entirely new direction as the rise of fundamentalists began to become more possible with the collapse of the regimes, the regime of Iraq, and then subsequently the weakening of Syria. So it seems to be the trend. We see this now in Libya and Yemen as well. So unfortunately this is... And the way these groups are manifested we saw gangs becoming organized in Iraq already in 2003. So they're learning as well. They're becoming better at the game so to speak. So they're becoming even more organized and ISIS really in a way represented to me the Apogee of organization that they were smart and using these kinds of things as propaganda, blowing up places, but they also behind the scenes were looting things and selling them for money. So in a way, it kind of dawned on me that basically this reflects a long process of learning. We saw in the bombing case with the Buddhas, that was a case of where they blew up these objects to make a statement but they were also looting at the same time. So this is part of that propaganda machine and part of the sort of attack against heritage to recreate a reality, create a kind of year zero effect value that they're taking the analogy from the Khmer Rouge period kind of idea that's now going to be the starting point of our history as opposed to actually having a reference to a much more ancient history. (mellow music) There are people who will find this very eutopic change comes from ideals. Without ideology, we just keep doing the same thing over and over and over again. And looting has been going on for so many years. When are we going to stop? Especially when it's non-renewable? And I think it's too big a price to pay to meet this desire that I could not understand to covet these objects at all, at any price without any questions asked. I think it is much more important to focus on our undiscovered past which is locked in objects that are still unexcavated and not looted. (mellow music) So the problem now is that, and you particularly see this London is that most antiquity dealers or many antiquity dealers particularly the high end antiquity dealers are sort of private galleries, collections that you make an appointment to see them then they show you the objects. So we did that, we made some appointments but then it's a very controlled process. So it's very hard to police and regulate this market and this is the problem I have. Is that it's not something that's easy for us to know what kind of objects are being obtained and then sold. The documentation from any of these objects is very poor. There's no clarity about how life history of something so if you buy a television in the supermarket or somewhere, you get more information about its life history, you know it came from China or someplace and all this but you have no idea with antiquities yet they're selling them for thousands of pounds or sometimes even up to a million pounds or more. So something or dollars. So something is really expensive high end, but yet you know nothing about it. So I find that... nevermind the antiquities and the heritage importance just as a buyer and seller, it just seems odd that you have a market that has no clarity about its sort of origin for the chief substance that's being traded. We would find that kind of unacceptable with most products so I don't see why now we can't do this with antiquities. (mellow music) We have organized crime make the illicit traffic of cultural property. It's not possible to deal with it without a criminal network. And we have in the market, we have objects, genuine objects that were illicit escavated in some areas as well as fake archeological objects. And especially we have several hundreds object seized. If we're talking about the Syria-Iraq seized at the border of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey that are recognized as a fake because unfortunately the illicit market wants to have objects coming from this area. If they have problems to find the original one, they produce it and put on the market, the fake one. (mellow music) Many of the forgeries now actually use state of the art technology. They have 3D scanners, they scan the object then they go and 3D print it and then do a cost on it. So sometimes the replica is a want just by inspector regulating inspection you would never find a difference. So what you really need to do is to have proper Rq Metric Sampling because with the pigments and the types of words and the types of stone and the markings, we can then differentiate between the fakes and the originals. (mellow music) Fake artifacts enter the market via fake certificates of origin. The same goes for looted and smuggled pieces. Sometimes they're kept in storage and enter the system when an opening presents itself. Once in, it is very difficult to track their origin because of the forged papers. Those artifacts pollute history because they're are taken out of the context of their origin and given a made up context instead. (mellow music) The forgeries are a real huge problem. Even if the forgeries are in the illicit market because normally after sometimes, these fake objects of art pop up in the illicit market and the real damage is not only because of the forgeries are giving the possibility to organized crime to gain money. It's not only this is the problem but also because they are polluting especially in the medium a long period, the cultural heritage because sometimes it's difficult to understand if an object is fake or a genuine. Well, if the fake objects of art is inside the market, the illicit market for a long period after that it will become original. (mellow music) There are a few fakes on display in many international museums but then they're not as many but there are a few fakes that put past as originals and are on display in many museums. Would you care to mention some museums carry fake arts? I would rather not because there isn't the kind of museum, the British Museum and the Turino Music, no. Okay. But it's in the big museums. Yes. (mumbles) And they know about it. No. Okay. Because it takes years of proper work with objects to be able to really see the fake from the real objects. And sometimes even the best Egyptologists would not know and you always need to take a chemical sample from the object to find out. And also because when the earlier Europeans were taking treasures from Egypt, the Egyptians were also smart. So they would hide objects for the Europeans to find that were fake. So some people believe that they've actually excavated an object that was hidden by the workman at the back. And also not just that, even mummies, sometimes when in the medieval period the West was amazed by mummies and they were looking for mommies everywhere. The Egyptians would find recent dead people and remummify them and sell them off as the ancient mummies. So I believe this is an ongoing tradition in Egypt. It's part of the heritage now. (mellow music) Talking about the counterfeit objects of art in general as I told you it's a real, huge phenomenon. We have to fight it as well as the looting or the elicit excavation. I would like to give you some example of an object that they were seized by the police forces that were put on sale in the market as of course in the illicit market as original. It should be an older Syrian book sold for several hundreds thousand Euro but it's fake. As well as this sculpture, this head of the sculpture it appears to be original but also this one is fake. Or this mosaic that we can see in this photo also it is sold in the illicit market as original but it's another case of a fake objects of art. Or this sculpture, this bronze little sculpture it is sold for a 1,000 euros but it's fake. Well, the illicit market wants to have everything. In everything the criminals are ready to give to the buyers if they want to have something but in different cases, these objects are fake. (mellow music) Now we know that the illicit traffic of antiquities is one of the hugest illegal businesses. UNESCO is estimating that it's several billions a year. So together we see illegal traffic off arms, drugs. It's one of the big businesses. And of course we know only the peak of the iceberg because we have no real and also UNESCO has no real idea what is really dimension. We only know because it's a worldwide problem. It's not only in the East because of Islamic State, this was of course an extreme situation but we know that after the American occupation of Iraq in 2003, we know that every week trucks full of antiquities left the country. And this is something which is for many many years is already working. Egypt there are families of grave looters. Even the grand facile of families there say, "Oh, my grandfather already started." This was even somehow... Yeah, it was a business but the problem is, this is the 19th to early 20th century but now it became really organized in an industrial way. And I think this is the lesson that we get from the pandemic looting that happened post 2011. Post 2011 museums were looted, magazines were looted. Archeological sites were illicitly dug. Even monasteries and Coptic churches sometimes were also looted. Mosques' members were stolen from mosques, lanterns were stolen from mosques. So it's not necessarily that it's a religious thing that the Egyptians felt so completely disconnected from ancient Egypt or that it was Pleja Heleya. It was mostly just greed and wanting to be equal to the... people had always had this idea that the previous government was stealing antiquities and was trading in antiquities on its own account so it's time that we have our share. And I believe it's still also ongoing in Egypt much much less than seven years ago when there was the outbreak of the looting. Unfortunately the looting has also spread to Syria, Iraq sometimes also in Yemen and I think also sometimes in Iraq particularly I was told by Iraq colleagues that the previous occupation of Iraq also had their share in dealing in the antiquities trade. So it is a problem and it's a problem also of Western Opportunism because if there is a market people would go and loot and people need to see looting as the black diamonds. In Egypt many of the looting gangs used children because children are small and agile and they can go down shafts to look for objects. Many of these children die because they're sanded over because there is no proper protection for them. So just in Abusir el-Malek, a village south of Cairo, 25 children died in one year post 2011 because they were used by the gangs to find objects So people in the West need to see that when you buy a scarab or an oshaptistatio or a lantern or an icon or a member you're actually buying an object that possibly a child has died for. So people need to see how unethical it is to actually buy these objects. And the less there is a market the less looting would happen because the more people are buying off the market even if they're buying fakes, the more the market is surviving. (mellow music) It's not simple of course to give a full dimension of the phenomenon for the illicit market, of the illicit traffic of cultural property coming every way. For sure, all regions of the world are affected. In all region of the world are sources, transit and destination countries. This is real important to understand. Until now, what is normally thought is a Europe or United states or Japan are the most important market for the illicit smuggling as a destination market. But unfortunately is not this way. The illicit market is going everywhere, is changing the routes also as a transit to try to avoid the action of the police forces and as well as of the customs. and we can understand the dimension of this phenomenon only if we ever seizures of the objects that they were stolen or illicitly excavated. And of course, it's not simple to seize the object in the illicit market. What we are able as police forces or as custom, unfortunately is a little part of the full illicit market. Well, if we don't have the seizures we cannot clearly understand the full phenomenon. Last year, 300 objects coming from the Mediterranean area, Greece, Egypt, Italy and also Syria, were seized in Uruguay in One Auction House. It really is strange because normally we don't think about South America as of destination of countries. It was really really strange. Well, how much is deep this phenomenon? We don't know but for sure is a real serious international crime. There are some rules already in the books about this but they're either poorly enforced or not really very comprehensive in coverage. And also they're easy to go around in a sense that you can forge documents and things like that. And the rules are not very tight in terms of how they're implemented. And those bodies that sort of do some of the implementation are not well-funded or well sort of established. So it makes it quite easy as a market to do a lots of illicit activity essentially. So it's like anything without any proper checks and balances. There's lots of room for mischievous kinds of activities and the various activities. And that's particularly, I think is what's happening here with a lot of the antiquities market. Not just in the west, I should emphasize or even places like Britain but certainly other countries this is the same story. (mellow music) The real challenges for us I think began or really emerged when ISIS took over. That's when the real real issues started. Because there you're dealing with a completely different set of dynamics. Now first I think it's very important to explain that the looting was not started by ISIS ISIS emerged in Syria and came upon the scene at the end of 2013 and early 2014. And it found a pre-existing situation and the looting had already begun in 2012. So they didn't invent the looting. But what they did do is escalate it and intensify it and turned it into something that would happen and occur on an literally an industrialized level. What they did was they looked at cultural heritage. They looked at archeological sites and monuments and they saw a resource. (mellow music) After ISIS took over, it became much more complicated and dangerous. As cultural heritage became a valuable resource, ISIS became very interested in it. They established offices and had men all over excavating and it became much harder to operate in secrecy. On numerous occasions, I almost got arrested simply because I was in the vicinity. So I became a suspect. The ISIS operations are so diverse you never know who you're dealing with. I had to be very careful about whom I talked to and what I said otherwise, I could be arrested and promptly executed. ISIS looks at cultural heritage. It loots what it can loot to sell and what it cannot sell, it will then use in other ways for propaganda purposes. So when... or for purposes of intimidation or for blackmail or... To them, it's a multi function multi-use resource. (dramatic music) And the amount of damage that this was causing you could chew up a whole hotel in a matter of a couple of weeks and we've seen and we started to see imagery of that. So operating in ISIS territory under very extreme conditions being able to gather this information photographing and then report on it, that was a huge challenge for us. There was major looting on a site on the banks of the Euphrates River. I was able to plant a worker on the site who took photos of the diggings and the fines. That's how we got some of the information that we use to track where the artifacts went. They ended up at the Rocca Action where we lost them. So we took it as far as we could given the resources we had. (mellow music) There are people who often know exactly what they want and there are dealers know what those people want because you have gangs. People who are organized and when they receive objects, they know exactly what kind of objects will be of interest to certain people or other dealers. If you really wanna see the illicit antiquities market, I would go to those border towns like Gaza and Tappan places like that. Places that were... If you think about it, they were sort of the market towns along the borders that would have thrived from illegal trade and also illicit prior to the war. But now have solely dependent on this kind of illicit activity, smuggling people and this sort of. And one end of things with this whole migrant issue that's going on in Europe, to things like smuggling antiquities all these things are often connected. It's often the same people smuggling and moving similar kinds of things or various objects including people to different places. It's basically someone who knows how to send something somewhere. If you know how to send a person, you know how to antiquities really it's the same thing in many respects, it's just cargo. So I think that's what's going on, is that you have people who have developed these kinds of networks of trade, dependent heavily on this illicit kinds of trade of things and antiquities being one of these odd things because it funds things like conflict and this is where it gets really nefarious. It's not just ISIS is the well-documented case, but also other groups have depended on these kinds of trade of antiquities to fund conflict. And so, just like we have Blood Diamonds funding conflict in Africa back in the '90s and early 2000s that was a big thing in the news. Now we've seen antiquities used in a very similar fashion as a way to fund conflict in groups. (dramatic music) And we've also found out or learned very quickly that a lot of the looted material and the looters know this and the buyers and sellers and middlemen know this, a lot of the material that is being dealt with it's material that is very ubiquitous. It's very common. So, this is one of the reasons why coins, gold coins and silver coins are so popular because they're found all over the region. They're found in fact, a Roman coin is probably the same Roman coin right across the Roman empire. So it could have been in Spain, it could be in England, it could be in Rome, in Italy, it can be in Libya, It can be in Syria. So how do you prove that this Roman coin that you saw on sale in a store in London came from Syria and not say from a legitimate collection of coins in France. Until recently there was nothing we could have done about it. It's very difficult to do this kind of discrimination until this new substance, this polymer called Smartwater and it's basically a water-based solution and it contains in it another technology-based product and it contains these elements, trace elements that provide a unique signature. So each sample, each application is a unique signature, unique sort of mark and by then applying this solution, this water soluble solution onto artifacts, onto objects we can use the uniqueness of this material to be able to determine where it came from. If this object then were to be stolen and then sold on the market somewhere and it is discovered, all you have to do is, as you saw shine a light on it a UV light and if it has that residue, the Smartwater residue because it's invisible When you apply to Smartwater, it is completely invisible it doesn't show unless you then shine UV light on it then it will show up. And then all you need is a microscopic sample of that. It's analyzed and it will tell you, exactly who applied it, when it was applied, where it was applied. (mellow music) I think it's a good and smart idea in a sense that not to be sort of playing with words, but in a sense that you can put something on an object and trace it. This has kind of been something a lot of us have been advocating is trying to trace objects that come across the borders so we can get a better sense of not only those objects and where they came from, but it can help us to understand that these networks of looting better because from a policing standpoint that's really the holy grail. If we understand those networks of trade, then we can get a better sense of who's involved, how the structure in organizations operates and the kinds of smuggling networks that may be applying themselves to this because it's not gonna just be antiquities if someone cracks this, they're gonna probably discover these people are involved in a whole slew of different things. I seriously doubt they're only doing smuggling antiquities. I think they're smuggling a lots of things. And so I think it will be a very... Potentially this kind of thing can be quite informative for just law enforcement in general. And this is a huge very important new tool in our arsenal to combat looting. And I think it will have a huge impact more on the demand side than on the supply side because if buyers are no longer confident of the origin of the pieces, they may not want to buy objects less they're sure. People only loot if it's profitable. If it's not profitable they stop looting. If they... And when there's a glove in the market, they'll stop looting. We've seen this happen. There's too much material, prices go down, prices go down they'll stop looting. That's how it works. (mellow music) The illicit traffic of cultural property as I told you before, is international crime, is a serious crime. Is an organized crime and ultimately it's not involved with only one field. If they understood that it's possible to get money and also without a huge penalties so they do it. Normally also these organized crime are not involved with only one field. This is the case of the illicit traffic of cultural property. They can be moved from one country to another country, say using the same illicit channel user that you move drugs or other illicit good. Well, we have evidences about these league, about money-laundering and about drugs. These crimes are several time are connected. Well, what looting does to cultural heritage is that it takes an objects from its historical context. We archeologists study what lies above the object, what lies at the object and what lies beneath it. And then we can create meaning and the historical story for each object. What looters do is that they don't go do that they go with their hoes, with their bulldozers just to find any objects to sell. So they change a historical object to just a mere artifact that has no story and has no history except for very little what. So I believe that around 75% of the object's history is lost by looting. Of course, this history is part of our shared history. Tells us a lot about how the people lived, what they ate for example, how they liked to get dressed, how they were buried and it gives us all the aspects of the story. So by looting, we lose the story we keep the objects but we completely lose the story. And if you ever... Some people say yes but you've seen what ISIS does. They completely break the objects. I just tell them, "Come see and look at how a looted site looks like." It looks exactly like what ISIS does to archeological site completely destroyed, bulldozed over all the archeological context is lost forever. So ISIS and looting are on the same ethical ground really one is destroying and the other one is equally destroying. There's nothing called saving an object by buying it off the market. And also looting as part of the international trade in each of particularly, it goes usually when they arrest gangs, they arrested selling drugs and arms. And also from a colleague of mine who works in Libya, he told me that ISIS in Libya sells antiquities to the Italian mafia and the Italian mafia in return gives them cash and course. So looting and antiquities are used as a commodity in the terrorist game particularly in the Middle East. So again, people wanting to buy an object saying, "I'm saving an object." They don't know that by saving an object, they're funding a terrorist. (mellow music) Well, when you see the videos destroying Palmyra or blasting the Syrian Palace in Nimrod or Nineveh. Of course it's horrifying. It's simply horrifying but one to erase, to destroy the history of its people because Palmyra for example was a city where people from the very East, from the very West because it was one of the endings of the Silk Road. The trade from China through Central Asia towards the Mediterranean and of course people understood the antiquities, the inscriptions which we have to show that people from different religions from all over the world live together. You see that the temples, the Bel Temple. It was a temple in Roman period, Then it was a Christian church, the Christian did not destroy it. They turned it into a church and when it was Islamic, when it was conquered by the Arabs, it was turned into a mosque, but not destroyed. And somehow they respected it that these have been important monuments. And this was shocking, that suddenly someone is coming to destroy it. There's only you can compare to what the Nazis did in India during the Second World War occupying countries and destroying their cultural heritage in trying to destroying their identity. This is the point. And the Syrians and the Syrian people have an identity and in their identity there are multiple layers of history, is very important for them. And then you see that they are really risking their life, young people trying to support then you see a half destroyed building monument and they're putting Sensex and other ways to protect it from collapsing completely. Meanwhile they're shooting around. Then you understand the cultural heritage and the necessity of heritage for your identity, is not only a Western concept it's for the people also very important and for their future. (mellow music) I think in terms of better or worse, the history of the past will wrap with the history of the present and the future in many ways. In a sense that what happens to the heritage, is gonna be very much related to what happens to places like the Middle East in the future. So politically, particularly so are we gonna see new countries formed out of what's going on in places like Syria. Are we gonna see the rise of non-state actors becoming a permanent thing in various parts of the world? The Philippines, North Africa other kind of regions as well. So I think what we're learning is that all these things seem to be connecting. The past with the present. So in terms of archeology and heritage, the only way it can improve, is if we now have greater stability in the wider parts of the globe. Some political processes that solves these regions problems because they are easy to be long-term problems. If we can find ways to address these issues of political stability but also population change and sort of growth and regions and economic stability that will begin to resolve the heritage issue much more clearly. Heritage actually has a huge benefit for countries economics potential. So the more we wrap those together in a sustainable way, that's also a positive thing. If you create positives for people, they're more likely to take care of it. People can't go on fighting forever. So what happens next is gonna be the incentive for everybody, is that how do we create a stable future that has also an economic potential. And so that's where heritage then has a positive role to play. (mellow music) The Syrians today are dying on both sides of... or the many sides of this conflict. And even though they disagree on almost everything, it seems that when it comes to their shared history, there still is some agreement. So whether you are from the South, the East or the West, everybody knows who Queen Zenobia was. Everybody knows where the first alphabet came from. It came from (mumbles) Queen Zenobia means Palmyra. Every Syrian recognizes that. So there is that shared common and also even as these different groups are fighting and killing each other, yet there are people on both sides also willing to risk their lives to save and protect and preserve cultural heritage and we've seen that. We've seen that in the opposition side, we've seen that on the regime side. So it seems that cultural heritage is still a shared... there's still a shared sense of identity around that. And for me, if I think a post-conflict and the need for a new identity that the Syrians can sort of come around then I need my cultural heritage. So saving serious cultural heritage is not just about saving the past, it's about saving its future too. (soft music) (festive drum music)
