Why doesn't it come out? Well done... It's coming. Slowly, darling. Well done. It's a girl. How is she? Wait. She's grey. Call the priest. One's already dead. Lord, have mercy on this soul lost in limbo. Where is she? How is she? I've already buried her. You should eat. How are you? Your body will forget. So will your heart. Father... What are you doing? You're pale. Did you eat anything? I'll take you home. Today is a joyful day. Because our brother Antonio has reached the Father's house. His soul is saved. Don't be afraid. Have faith. “Ask and it will be given to you.” “Seek and you will find.” “Knock and the door will be opened to you.” Father... I want to give her a name. I can't. Nobody will know it. Stillborn babies can't receive baptism. She hasn't drawn her first breath. It's the rule. How long will she stay there? Forever. Will I see her again? In your dreams. Agata! Agata! Go to Ignac! - What? - Ignac! Mattia... The priest won't baptize her. How are you? Have you rested? No, why, have you? No. You don't care. She's in limbo! I'm suffering, too. We must go to Ignac. Ignac? The priest's housekeeper told me. Come with me. And what can Ignac do? Aren't you going to accompany me? But what can he do? We'll have other children. Where is she? In the wood. Why did they tell me to come to you? Can you help me? You know something? There is a church, they can awaken stillborn babies. A breath. Just enough time to baptize them. Is it the truth? I saw it. Where is it? In the mountains. In Dolais Valley. Agata! Agata! Where are you? Sleep, beautiful daughter. From the seabed, a long wave swells, bringing sleep with it. The moon is broken in the black water, the tide rises slowly. Where do you have to go? North. You've taken the wrong path. You are dressed too light. I'll lead you to the right one. What's your name? Agata. Let's go. You will get lost. Let's go! Do you have children? One daughter. And your husband? He remained on the island. Why are you going to the North? I know of a wagon going north. Good morning, Lince. You're accompanied today? I'm going to Assunta. Things are going well for you! - Morning. - Morning. She has milk. - Are you sure? - Sure. Come with me. Where are you from? From the sea. Fisherfolks, then. Yes. In Ariin they are looking for one. - How much do I get? - What you deserve. I found her. You found her and so you will take her. Where? To be a wet nurse in a rich nome. Give me the baby. I don't care. Try! I have to go to Dolais valley. To do what? - Come on! - Let's go. Let go of me! - Pay me now. - Half now and half when you come back. Get in, let's go! You hurt yourself. Help me! Get her up there! Calm down! Stay still. Don't get nervous, you'll lose your milk. You could have just told me which way to go. Stay still! No one needs a dry nurse. Leave me, please. Shut up. Give it. Give me the walnut. Give it to me, give it. Kid, you still have to learn. Did you sleep enough? Did you rest? Look! Where are you going? She doesn't answer. - She's deaf. - She really must be deaf. Where are you going? My own way. Are you looking for a maggot to go fishing? You wish! You must be tired of walking. Who, me? I'm faster than you! - Well, if only you knew. - You got that right! Do you want a lift? We already have a woman here. Dont be afraid. What are your plans? I'm taking her to Ariin, to be a wet nurse. They take everything from us, don't they? I have to go up north. On your own? Yes. Aren't you afraid? You didn't think about it. Too bad. What do you nave in those crates? Our work tools. Chief, stop the wagon, I have arrived! - I don't want to stop here! - Stop! We'll be late! - Stop! - Stop, stop. Everybody down, come on. Get down. Off the wagon! - Get down. - Move it. - Come on! - Quick! Get your arms up. Stay still. Come here! Move! Down on your knees! He's running away! - Are you crazy? - Shut up. Give us everything you have and we'll let you go! Check what's on the wagon. - Glass. - Let me see. What have you got there? Do I have to smash your face? Stay still. What's this crazy thing? What is it? It's a light bulb. What's it for? To make light. They put them in the cities. Show me how it works. We don't have power. It's not working, are you fooling me? No, no! They need power, I told you. - You are fooling me! - No! Check what they have in the pocket! - Give me the ring. - I have nothing. Open everything, check what they have! - Calm down. - Stop it. - They have nothing! - Up! - Do you have so much courage now? - Derelicts. Check them. What do you have under your clothes that you care so much about, uh? Get it out! Come on. Let it go! - Take it! - Cut it out! Let it go! Give them the box! - Come on! - Give it up! Let it go! - Let it go! - Give it to me. Do you have something hidden? Let me go. Go, sweetie, go. Go away. Come on, hurry up! What's in there? My belongings. Do you know where's the Dolais Valley? I was born there. How far is it? Far enough. Take me there. What's in it for me? If I don't take you to Ariin, I want what's in the box. I'll give you half of what's in here. But I won't show you until we get there. Alright. Where we are? Let me talk. This should be the direction. Good evening. What did he say? Women can't go in. None comes out alive. The mountain takes them. Will it take less this way? Two days less. Do you understand me? Yes. Did you ever get in there? No. Do you know any woman who got in? No one comes back. They run away. Where? The other side. Let's go. It's dangerous. He's asking if you want to die. The mountain will see you. Come on. Do you want half of the box? I'm going. Let's go this way. Isn't it that way? Let's go back. I'm sure it won't take long. We'll never get out. Let's go. I can't breath. Think about the sea waves. I never saw the sea. It's immense water. It's so big you can go about it for days without seeing the land. Wait. It went out. Let's stop. Sea water is salted. If you drink it, it'll scratch your throat hard. If you have a cut, it'll burn. But it heals. The salt stays on you. It dries on your skin and you can lick it off. The sea goes everywhere. And even if you're far away you can smell it. What does it smell like? Of water, of fish, of salt. algae... All the smells. My sister's hair smells like the sea. Can you see it? Wait. Come. How far? Far enough. How much? Two years if you walk so slow. Mushrooms. Good? Hazelnut. Stone. We call it "chiarо botola". Rock. Is Lince your real name? They are all rotten. If you have no name. it's like you didn't exist. You don't exist, when nobody knows you wake up and breathe in the morning. If died now, no one would know. I would. This pale... pansy Taken now from the vase, long live love. I want to give it to my Mariute, To my own good that is all mine. Go in the mountains to pick up flowers... Ask my family at home since they are my masters, long live the love. Ask my family at home, Since they are my masters. Come. Give me that. Let it go. I was joking. How long is left? You need help. Come on! Come. Come. Let's go. I did not recognize you. There is a girl over there, by the tree. What do you want? What do you both want? She is sick. We need help. Who is it? Your daughter. I don't care. She just need to rest a little. - Send her away! - A little... If you don't send her away, I'll go out. Nothing has changed then. I always pray for you. Don't worry, I'll manage. Wait, turn her around. This girl gave birth a few days ago. Help me pull her skirt down. - We have to wash her. - Yes, get some hot water. Get some of that ointment too. You're not the first woman to come by with an empty womb. Are you going to the Sanctuary? No one ever came back to tell us how it was. Do you think you deserve this miracle? Were you good enough? At the Sanctuary I'll be able to give her a name. Who knows. You might fall. You didn't tell us your name. Agata. Agata? Nothing is done for nothing. I have no money. But you have beautiful hair. I thought you had left. I can't give you the box. I don't understand. There's my daughter in there. You're not far. You will reach a lake. Keep going north. Don't leave me. You scare me. You don't give a name to dead things. Lince! Lince... She came out of me. Do you have to go to the other side? What name did you choose? You'll have other children. How do you want to name this child? Sea. Don't be afraid of the darkness anymore. You are free. SMALL BODY Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
