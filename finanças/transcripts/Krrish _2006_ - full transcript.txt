What a mess! Krishna...Krishna...Krishna... What am l going to do with this boy...? Krishna... Yes, grandma? Whose sketch book is this? Mine, grandma. And who made these sketches? Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes ask childish questions...? lf it's my sketch book, obviously, l've made the sketches. Grown ups talk like children when children act like grown ups. Tell me something, how did you make such beautiful sketches? With this. Like l've made your sketch right now. See? Wow! Let me see! Rohit loved drawing too. Papa made sketches too? Yes. When Rohit was your age and he used to get tired studying he used to sketch. l want to be like my Papa too. You are like your Papa! Mrs Mehra, l've called you here to tell you that... we want to take Krishna's l.Q. test. l.Q. test...? But why, Father? Krishna's absolutely normal. No, Mrs Mehra. He's not normal. What are you saying, Father? Are you telling me... that Krishna is the same as Rohit was in his childhood? No, Father. Krishna's a very bright child. He scores very good marks, he always gets A-plus grades. He even does his homework without any help. And that of other children too. What? This is the notebook of a Class 3 student. This is... ...Krishna's handwriting. Yes, Krishna has done this child's math homework. But how's that possible, Father? Krishna's still in Class 1. That's exactly why we wish to take Krishna's l.Q. test... so that we can ascertain just how bright, sharp and ahead he is... of other children his age Krishna, how do you define amount? Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir After what age does the brain of a person stop growing? Afterthe age of 15, Father. What happened, Mrs Mehra? The l.Q. test was going so well, Krishna was answering all questions right... That's exactly why l brought him away. But why? You ought to be proud that your grandson is so brilliant. He's a genius, a miracle child. Earlier it was a hunch but now l'm sure. The powers that Jadoo had bestowed on Rohit... ...have been inherited by Krishna. You will see, Mrs Mehra. Like his father... ...Krishna will also achieve great success. His name will appear in the Guinness Book ... ...and the whole world will speak highly of him. That's exactly what l don't want, Father. What did Rohit gain, after all? They gave him medals, applauded him... but everybody only used him.. ...took advantage of him, Father. And then... ...l lost my son and my daughter-in-law. l don't want to lose Krishna now. l don't want to lose him. l can understand your concern and fears. But destiny cannot be changed. And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden. l will hide it. l'll take Krishna far away... ... very far. Krishna... Krishna... Coming, Grandma! Toofan, let's see who gets home first. Hey... what did you see? As usual, l've seen nothing and l won't say a word to anyone. But as usual, l'll take something from you. Take this! l hide all your secrets and you always give me jaggery? lt won't work today. Ok, ok, come home... l'll give you Bournvita. Bournvita? Yes. Don't you want to be like me? Yes! So go, wear something below and come. Krishna... You've come? Grandma, how do you know l've come? l make no sound at all! l can hearyour heartbeats. But how, Grandma? Your eyes say that you've been upto mischief again. Mischief? Not at all, Grandma! No mischief? Then why're you hiding yourface like a thief? Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma Ok ok.. lay the breakfast. l've come! What happened? Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma... Me? Chintu! Upto mischief again? Tell herthe truth, Krishna, else l shall. Sure, go ahead l'll tell her since you've asked me to Grandma, Krishna was running faster than Toofan today What? Fasterthan Toofan? So? What's the big deal? And how about that? What? You climbed the mountain faster than the monkeys... Grandma, you know that tall mountain by the temple? Krishna jumped from it into the river. l thought it was all over. But he came back! Krishna, why do you do such things? l've forbidden you time and again! Why do you still do such things? What do l do Grandma? You tell me! How do l rid myself of loneliness? Who do l make friends with? Boys my age have gone away to the city, to either study or earn a living And those that are here don't want be friends with me They say... l'm not like them So l've made friends with animals and birds Keep myself busy with nature. But even out here in the open, l sometimes feel stifled l feel like running far away from here. Will you leave me and go away? lt's because of you that l don't go! Else, l'd have left long ago Krishna has grown up, Rohit l'm not sure how long l will be able to hide him Where is Sonia Mehra and her grandson Krishna, Father? lt's the third time in so many years that l've come to ask you And my answer is still the same. l have no idea where Mrs Mehra is. l really don't know! Why do you keep coming to me again and again and waste my time? Because you are the last link to Rohit Mehra's family... and you're the last person Sonia Mehra met before she went missing You know where they are, but you're lying. What? You are lying, Father. When l asked you whether Krishna possessed the powers Rohit had... you said he didn't. But l was told...that the son was betterthan his father That he possesses all of Rohit's powers. So tell me, Father... l'll pay any price you ask How dare you! Mr Sinha, this is a school! We don't indulge in business here! Please leave now! You're making a mistake, Father. A big mistake. Krishna! Look! What a huge kite! But where's the string? Must've snapped. Let's get it! Don't scream! You needn't be afraid Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly Stop screaming! Else, l'll drop you. Close your eyes Close your eyes, not widen them. Close them! Close! The glider came this way! There it is! Where...? Up there! Oh my God! Where's Priya? There! She's breathing. She must've passed out Let's take her back to the camp The glider was at such a height, Priya Ma'am was down here... ...and she's still breathing? Just imagine! Just imagine. lmagine! Where am l...?

The boy who saved me on the tree... the one l told you about, sir... God! What's happened to this girl? Priya, it's just 2 seconds since l left... Are you saying that someone came and even went away in the meantime...? You must've dozed off and probably had a dream. l didn't dream! Why doesn't someone believe me? The moment l closed my eyes, he entered the tent... he twisted my ankle and the pain... Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See! The pain has disappeared! Oh my God sir! My foot is all right! Look at this... l can jump! My foot has become all right Eitherthis girl has really gone mad, or she's conning us! No, sir! l'm not conning you! See... l can jump! Believe me! l believe you!

Are you looking for someone? What...? You! l'm looking foryou! Where do you keep disappearing? Why don't you appear before others as you appear before me?

Firstly you call me aunty and then you ask who l am speaking to? l'm talking to this boy! Which Boy? Can't you see this boy here...? That's a lamppost there, not a Boy, That's a boy Lamppost Boy!

What happened? Kalicharan was putting some flowers in Champa's hair... Lalcharan happened to see them. He went red with rage! And one day, he deceived Champa into drinking poison, in the name of medicine And poor Champa! She screamed, ''Kali, Kali...'' ... and died. Just imagine! Kalicharan just could not bear the pain of Champa's death Overthere! Look at that peak! From that very peak, Kalicharan screamed, ''Champa, Champa...'' ... and jumped to his death! Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has been looking for his Champa! Why're you pointing towards me? Because you are his Champa Me...? Champa! l mean, you look like Champa l'm feeling terribly scared.

See these stars, Krishna... ...with these infinite twinkling stars in the sky... ...you, yourfather, your grandfather... ...and l share a very deep relationship. Your grandfather was a space scientist One night, he started receiving a reply to a signal he had sent to outer space Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky... ...the car swerved out of control l survived the accident... ...but your grandfather. l was pregnant with Rohit at that time... ...he had sustained a head injury in the accident... ...because of which he was born abnormal. ...even when he grew up, he had the l.Q. of a child. One night, in our small town, a huge spaceship descended. Some Aliens emerged from it... ...but one could not go back. And that is how Rohit met Jadoo. Jadoo had supernatural powers... ...which he passed on to Rohit. Rohit changed completely. Jadoo eventually went away... ...but he did not take back the powers he had given to Rohit. And thereafter, everything changed forever. My son could do things that were impossible for an ordinary human being. lt was around then that Rohit married your mother. And very soon, his fame spread across the world. The chairman of the world's largest lnformation Technology Company... ...invited Rohit abroad. Thank You. Welcome to Technotronics. Come with me, Sir Dr Arya shall be here shortly Mr. Rohit Mehra? l'm sorry to keep you waiting lt's all right, Sir. l was, this book... Oh yes, that's the first copy of my latest book. Please read it and give your opinion. lt's a wonderful book, Sir. You've done a lot of research. How can you say that without reading it? l've already read it, Sir. Read it? There are printing errors on page 126, 244 and 354 l've marked them. You've read this 400 page book in just 10 minutes? l forgot who l was talking to. Asking you such questions is an insult to yourtalent. lt's an honourto meet you. The honour is mine, Sir. l still can't believe... ...that l'm standing face to face with a great scientist and innovator like you. Your achievements in the field of wireless communication... ...is no less than a revolution, Sir. You've invented the palmtop. People can watch cricket matches on their phones, thanks to you. l have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision... ...lf this dream comes true, it could change the destiny of the world. And l need your help to realise this dream. l want to build a computer that can see the future. That can see the future. Future? What would you like, tea or coffee? l understand your dream, your vision, Sir. You want to combine astrology, astronomy and technology... ...to build a computerthat can see the future. Exactly! That's precisely why l've called you here. Because the people l have here are trained... ...not gifted like you. What are you thinking, Rohit? Sir, if we can really build a computer that can see the future then... Then, think of the good we can do forthis planet and mankind! Wars can be prevented Earthquakes, famines, floods, can be prevented. Even if we can't prevent them, we can at least be prepared forthem. You've already started seeing the future, Rohit. Welcome! ln the hope that this union of brilliance and vision will become history. Create history! lt took him two whole years... ...but Rohit achieved the impossible... ...he built a computer that could see the future... ...lt was around the time when you were going to be born. Hello?- Mom? Rohit, l've brought Nisha to the hospital. That's where l'm calling from. Congratulations! You're going to become a father anytime. Come back soon. l'm coming, Mom...l'm coming! Rohit? What's the matter? You sound tense. l've been exploited. The world is very selfish But don't worry! l'll be back soon! But my son did not come back. Moments afteryou were born, we received word ...that a fire broke out in the lab... ...and they couldn't save Rohit. Your mother couldn't bearthe shock... ...and passed away in a few days. When you were five years old... ...l got to know that you too were born with extraordinary powers... ...that Rohit had. l got scared. l didn't want the world to know about you. And that's why l brought you here... ...a place where nobody knew us. l didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna. You no longer want to see my face... ...but l'm living only foryou, Krishna Yes, l'm selfish, very selfish. Grandma? What are you doing? l've taken out some of yourfather's clothes. You can't go to Singapore like this! But Grandma? l could shield you from the world... ...but not your heart. Go, bring Priya here. Krishna... ...stay carefully there Eat and sleep on time, don't talk too much with anybody. And don't get into any trouble... ...whateveryou do, make sure you behave like any other man. Don't get carried away to do things that make people realise... Who l am? Right, Grandma? Yes, my son. Don't worry, Grandma. l won't let anybody know about me. l'll keep my strength, my abilities and my talent... hidden. That's a promise, Grandma. Welcome to Singapore, Sir. - Thank you. Your welcome sounds different... and nicer, today. Good afternoon, sir. A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur. But sir... -Yes, yes, l know... l've come a few days in advance. But l couldn't help it. l've waited so many years... ...but now that we're so close to success... ...being patient is very difficult. Must say you and yourteam deserve credit... ...for making my dream come true again. Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra... lf it wasn't for his notes and research... ...it was impossible to build that computer again. Absolute genius!-You're right, sir The computerthat Rohit made in 2 years... ...has taken us so many years to make. That's why l still miss him. Excuse me People say ''Who has seen the future?'' But in a few days, you and l... ...will change this forever. Breaking news! Afteryears of struggle, hard work, research and patience... ...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project is about to be completed. According to our correspondent, in just a few days... ...Dr Arya will be able to predict the future of individuals, countries and the world!
