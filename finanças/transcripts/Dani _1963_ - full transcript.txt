Hi, Goga. Where were you last night? We were looking for you. He went on a short trip, for a day or two. I haven't picked it up, yet. Yes, yes, 200 dinars. You receive the application form on the counter. Misko is at school. He won't be coming home, he is visiting his mother, today is her day. He's not coming tomorrow either, Branko will pick him up on the way home. My home is empty. Oh no! I couldn't go there. You know that she can't stand me. After all, she was Branko's wife before me. I would only make it inconvenient for the little one. In the cooperative? Branko lost his money too. I don't know. Which ones? Have you seen those purses at the Yugoexport? One cannot get a proper combing, coiffeurs are full. I'm bothering you, you're busy. We couldn't go through, everything was blocked. Ah, ???????? She is on duty tonight... and I thought... ah... well... nothing's a matter... like... if at least Misko was here. Bye. Send my regards to Uros. Good afternoon. What can I do for you? Please, take a look, something is wrong with it. Has it fallen? That's my husband's watch... I don't know. Only the hourhands tangled, the watch alone is in order. It needs winding up... - Thank you, how much do I owe you? - Nothing, madam, it's a trifle. - I would like to measure my weight. - Please, feel free. That's an adequate measure for you... and it looks very good. They still don't have ???? You see, they asked it from me again... Is it of any help? It helps, only to fool ourselves... What can one do, the end is the same for all of us. If there is any left, please, save some for me. Thank you, goodbye. To save it... if only it had any effect. What can I do, it's about his father. He's been in pains for years. Now it's the end of him. Goodbye. Oh doctor, my head is in pains there's no healing for this love feeling from your pharmacy store Ugh. Pardon me, you stepped in suddenly. Oh, it's you again, Goga. Aunt is ill? I hope it's nothing serious. Is that true? You never know. Don't worry, I'll visit them. I'll call you tonight. I will. I'll send your regards. Do you have any toys for a seven year old boy? We'll find something. Here you go. Something less dangerous. No. No. Not at all, no. That's too expensive, my son would anyway tear it apart instantly. Could you give it to me. I'll buy this. Your little one will be glad to have it. Oh! Goga is here! Goga is here! It's not Goga, it is I, aunty, Nina. Could you leave us now, Mara. How are you, aunt? I've heard you were ill. So you've heard... khm... I could even die, waiting for you. What does the doctor say? I need a gravedigger! Not a doctor. If only god had mercy on me... to take me... Don't be like that, aunt. Last night, through this window Darinka came! Darinka who? Darinka, my sister-in-law. The one that went to Vienna. She passed away long time ago, aunty. Died?! You died and she came here! That's why I told Mara not to leave the window opened! And what is that, Goga? Just something I bought. Give ti to me, give me! That's not for you, aunty. A toy, for Misko. Let me see it! Give it to me! I want it! I want it! But that's a toy. Not for you, it's for Misko. Aunty, you're ill. Don't. So be it! I should die! I had it coming! You know that we love you! Not true! You've taken everything away from me, and won't give me nothing! And umbrella too! Umbrella too! What happend with the umbrella? Nothing! Have you lost it? Even earlier! Earlier when? Earlier! When I was still healthy! And my mother died too! She is the only one who called me Duda! But aunty, that was so long ago. But I lost the umbrella now! What was it like? Like what! Black! How else would've it been! I'll find it. I had mom too! Today is the anniversary of her death! And no one wants to go visit her! I will go, aunty. And this... will you give it to me? You can have it. I know a song, too. Midnight is so voiceless The night is so dark And I will even in the dark those little lips of yours find And I will even in the dark those little lips of yours find And I will even in the dark those little lips of yours find - Oh! - Oh! Excuse me, I didn't see you. It's my fault. My mind wandered off. I almost have no recollection of the entrance... how 'bout you? I was a little bit more grown up at that time. It looks like an elephant to me. Did someone get killed in it? I guess... It's been a while since I've been to Kalemegdan. - I see this for the first time. - That's the part of the museum. What is further? Nothing, fields with pathways and benchs. On the crossing today remember? Were you scared? And you, did you send the medicine to your father? How did you know about my father's illness? The pharmacist told me. Exactly, we've met in a pharmacy too! For the third time today. We should celebrate. How 'bout it? It would make no sense if we went by each other this time too? This part of Kalemegdan is completely restored. I mean, the pathway. The field stayed the same. Did you not go in the other direction? I know. We don't know each other. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm in a bad mood. Me too. What in the first place made you go to the pharmacy? Just like that. To get measured. Actually... I didn't even need that, really. I wanted to go in... and I did. We've already crossed the whole field. - Do you want us to go somewhere? - Why? You really are in a bad mood. But we can try something. Let's go away, we'll talk, without any questions asked you don't even have to tell me your name. My name is Nina. Mine is Dragan. - Should we go from here? - Umhm. That car has more interesting biography than me. It's assembled from four other cars from the dump. When I graduated my father sent me money to buy an apartment. I still don't have an apartment. What is your father ill from? I think my dad is dying. Does he know that? He's a doctor. There, instead of lightening your mood, I... No... why... My mood is not the most important thing in the world. Not even to me. Just to get things straight - it's your own fault! We agreed on not asking any questions. Dragan! Dragan! Come home! You're not the only Dragan in the world. So, what's wrong with your car? Flat tire. One of the wheels went berserk. I left it parked on the corner of Nusiceva street. It's here. Here, kitty. Here, kitty. It can't get out, should we help it? Be careful, maybe it has rabies. It will scratch you. - Ouch! - What is it? Did it scratch you? Who, this cat? Not at all! It's so cute! Aaaah... Meaow! Meaow. Meaow. Are you still in a bad mood? Actually... Should we have another roll? They make the best ones here. I'll take one with poppy. That's going to be my lunch, anyway. Thank you. Why? I don't understand. You were afraid it will scratch me. Hm... Wrong song. It's actually very nice. What day is today? Fast! Tell me... Well... Wait... Alright. Now I believe you're feeling better. Is it written there? No, no, not like that! Ok, let's go. This way! Come when you'll have time... I turn around and she's still... And I go "slap". Wait... I measured myself three times this morning. Always different result. - This here... that one here... - Wait a bit... Here it is... 58 kg, 200 g. How 'bout together? Wait, wait... Like that... Should I let go... That is... 146 kg, 403 g. Please. Buddy, please more... Hey, that's too much! Have you seen this movie? A friend told me about it. Potboiler. A boring one. Yes, this morning, I'm coming out of the pharmacy and he goes: Oh doctor, my head is in pains Can you imagine, bouffant hair, blonde, this big... Horrible! When i got there, she told me: "If madamme is free in the afternoon, she can pick a number now" Look at this! Did you know they can walk? - Walk? - Seriously! Like penguins do. What about zebras? There they are! Oh look! That wasn't here before! Umhm. - So, what you're saying, for the whole two months? - From day to day. So, together we have 148? Umhm. She looked at me as if I were crazy! Me too! Hey doll, you! I'm talking to you, gorgeous. Damn, see those legs! What do you want? No one asked you anything, mate. We're talking to this babe over here. My pretty little sweetheart. Get lost! Easy there, mate, be nice. This babe here is a real beauty. Don't be so selfish. Let us take a bite too. Look at him! He's becoming rough. What's happening, comrades? Nothing, just a friendly discussion. Our mate here is a bit nervous. - They were rude to my friend. - Let's go. Come on, beat it. You don't want to get arrested. You too, comrade. What did punks say? Dolly doll. I like it. Pretty little sweetheart. Want me to arrest you?! Look at this, come! [indistinct blabber] You should let me go now. Why? Where? I promised to an old... cousin. Aunt. She is ill, I have to go. And afterwards? I need to see you. I'll be waiting for you on the Kalemegdan fortress at 6pm, same place. Goodbye. Missus! Missus! I'm here! What's the time, please? I'm sorry, clock's out of order. I didn't wind it up. What day is today? Could you please tell me what time is it? It's 6pm. That's it for today. It's six o'clock, we're closed. My aunt lost her umbrella some time ago... She is ill, so I came looking for it. What kind of umbrella was it? Black, plain. Any other info? No. But it think I would recognize it. Here you go, try to find it. Nina! Ah... Did we meet by chance? "I got a flat tire." "One of the wheels went berserk." "I left it parked on the corner of Nusiceva street." So you went looking for me? Actually, I was looking for umbrella. What for an umbrella? They said it will be difficult to find it. They're all the same. I mean, the umbrella. Arrest me if I'm guilty. Let's go to the airport. I have to send the medicine to my father. And after that? Wherever you want. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Could I please send a medicine to Mostar? It is urgent. Alright. I need to talk with the pilots, please, wait a bit. Someone in Mostar must wait for the medicine at the airport. That's settled for. Here you go, thank you very much. Goodbye. Excuse me... - Would you be so kind to take care of my little one. - No problem. I've been called by the reception. Why are you not traveling? I'v been traveling. I am traveling... I am traveling! I am traveling! Have you traveled by a plane already, little fella? - Yes I have. - And how was it? Nice. All the toys... - What toys? - Toys! And how are you called, little one? I'm not being called! What's your name?! Ducko. Only Ducko? You must have some other name as well? - I have, Duca. - Oh, Duca. My mom travels. Alright. But where are you traveling? Traveling. Do you have a daddy? But where to, Ducko? But I have one! Why aren't you going with us? I hope he wasn't bothering you. No, he was sweet. Thanks a lot. Say "thank you" Ducko, come on. Mom, she's not traveling. Ducko, honey, what's with you today? What did I teach you? To work. You see what a smart kid you are. Look. The old airport. Deserted. Shall we? What's so strange? Nothing, like I've been to another city. Let's go to the post office, ok? I have to make a call. ... Skopje, cabin four... I was afraid it was all over... no change? Well... Alright. What does the doctor say? I don't know. Well... is there no hope at all? Is he still suffering the same? Yes... I've sent it. Should I take ten more ampules? Alright. Right away, tomorrow. Alright. Yes. Get me notified, please. I'll try to come there. As soon as I can. I know. Alright. Goodbye. Goodbye. Where do you live? In Novi Beograd. Alone? With a husband. THE END
