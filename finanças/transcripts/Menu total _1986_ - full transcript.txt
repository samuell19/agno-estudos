To support this movie Filmförderung NW and Kommunalverband Ruhrgebiet gave a few bucks. The old lady stepped aside and looked at us with such sad eyes, with such an aghasted expression that our lust arose... It was the day of the scandal when she heard the yellings and left the house... He live long; he live long. To the world, the future and those, who will be thankful one day. Free and easy, yeah, yeah, yeah! Every time I see you, I know, that we didn't do it in vain. There is nothing better than the young and uncomplicated people. Well, at least, it's his wife. Who made her the shirt? - She is supposed to get changed. You're supposed to get changed, get changed! To the world, the future and those, who will be thankful one day. A new day is like a new life. Isn't it great to be on earth? Do we have some music, music, music? - - Yesssss. - - Free and easy, yeah, yeah, yeah! Do we have some music? - Yesssss. - - Help. - - Help. Help. And if the saviour comes, he will eat your folks; and not because he's vicious, but because they are delicious. Mom, mom, mooooom... No...! No...! Do you wanna listen to some music? I'm gonna punch this son of a bitch in the face. - - Mooooom. - - Daddy! - Your mom is here! Your mom. Cut it out. Your mother... I've got the bag! Your daddy! The bag... I've got the bag! Your mom! - - Ludwig! - - I've got the bag! Your mom! Mom, that's Marta... we're playing billiard. She doesn't do anything, hear anything or say anything! She collected and operated the whole life and we get the profit. Stop it now, I wanna go and show you something. Great...! He is still the same. Leave him alone! Why not?! Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take. Bravo, bravo, well done, well done... bravo, bravo, well done, well done... That's enough now! We have to go! - - Joe...? - - Joe...? Are you asleep? Your dad and your mom have to go away for a while and the little soldiers and fighters have to be real brave now! My moms and dads had to go away for a little while too and I promised them not to be afraid, so they wouldn't be sad. And when I was all alone I said to myself over and over again: "Your mom and dad are doing this just for you, just for you, just for you, for you, for you!" It's time now, we're waiting. Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep... Even if you disregard the metaphysical point of view and look at the world rationally, , that is from the outside, you still need some understanding for the whole unity. The struggle for existence and for the problemchild has to be carried on constantly. When we think about the struggle, we can take comfort with the confidence, that war doesn't rage without end in nature and that the happy one, the strong one and the healthy one survives and reproduces. He live long... Dr. De Pen, please! You understand? You mustn't hurt the children. Their future is our future and our work is their future. Imagine there were four generations. We would be the Gods... and our sons the Ischariots and their children the cannibals. And the others the farts. They don't care where they explode You know exactly what I'm talking about. Mooom! Moooooooom...! Can you get it? Keep trying Let me do it, you can't do anything! - - Help...! - - The bag! THE BAAAAAAG...! The bag...! The bag...! - - Where...? - - The bag...! BAG!!!!!! In a strong... in a strong... You're supposed to get changed, get changed! Let's sing! - Yeah, let's sing! Is there disgust? - No! Is there loneliness? - No! Is there standstill? - No! And the torture? What you can do today, do not delay! Polonaise...! And if the saviour comes, he will eat your folks; and not because he's vicious, but because they are delicious. Shit... and now? - Let's take his car! Now this again, look at it. Well, it's still your son. - - Daddy! - - The baaaag! Do it! Do it! Bump into him! Now I'll bump into him! You'll get your accident! Come on, do it! Don't worry, you'll get your accident! Are you happy now? There is your accident! Dr. De Pen, please! You understand? - No! Nope! When are you coming? - Bring me the babe! When are you coming? - On the field! When? - You gotta go now! I need you. - Oh yeah? When? - On the field! And Cuca? - I’ll get rid of her! Help me! Help me! Most cases of suffocation happen in good restaurants. Never in cheap ones. That is connected with the fact that it's much more embarrassing for a customer to swallow the wrong way or, if necessary to vomit (Puke! Throw up) in a fancy environment. They rather hurry to the bathroom, where they suffocate helplessly. In a cheap restaurant on the other hand, where cabdrivers and prostitutes walk in, they don't mind throwing up on the table when they are imminent to suffocate. But they survive! Evi, I'm hungry! What else do you have to tell me? I slaughtered my aunt. My aunt was old and weak. I stayed at her house over night and dug in some boxes. My last word: One likes to ask the young:"... What do you want to be?" Me carriagedriver, me soldier and me confectioner you hear them say. When I was a little kid, all those new questions came along my way. I didn't hesitate and still see their faces when I told them I liked desecration of the corpses. Eat...! Evi, eat...! Eat, Evi...! Eat! Evi... eat...! Eat! Cuca is dead! Now she doesn't stink any longer! Keep going! Keep going! Back, back! Keep going! Now turn, turn! Keep going, keep going... turn, turn. They just left you here? I didn't think they'd do that! Parents can't do that, you see? That has to involve others... something like that! The older generation has to protect itself. But only against the young... Protect itself against the young people... And they are still their children... and you mustn't hurt the children... you mustn't hurt the children! To the world, the future and those, who will be thankful one day. - Yeah! A new day is like a new life. Isn't it great to be on earth? Is there disgust? - No! Is there loneliness? - No! Is there standstill? - Nooooo! And the torture? What you can do today, do not delay! Polonaise!
