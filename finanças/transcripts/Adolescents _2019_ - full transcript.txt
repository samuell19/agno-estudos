The film you're about to see was born under a lucky star. So it's give-and-take. If you're great, I have no reason to think, What can I do to trash their lives today? However, if we have issues, I change my outlook. Got it? This is 8th grade. Get an F in English, you're no dimwit. You're a student. A straight-A student who's odious and mean, that's a dimwit. When you come in, I don't think, Here's my C-student. There's my B-student. Leave it to me, it's my job. You go from an E to a D or C, you're an excellent student. If you go from a B to a C or D, you're a bad student. Teachers aren't here to say if you'll make it in life. I can't see 10 years ahead. Our schedule sucks. Is PE Monday at 8 gonna fly with me? They said they'd split us up, but it's not true. Guess who's all together. Alex, Zoé, Chaïma too, I think. - And Mathis. - Not Chaïma. What a coincidence, really. They all asked. - You know Issam Taïch? - Yes. - He's hot. - Yeah. - Mehdi's cuter. - Issam Taïch. Mehdi Bouloufa. Jimmy Fernandez, too. - I know his sister. - How do you know these guys? They're all from Brive. - We just do. - Everybody in Brive knows them. If you don't know them, you're a loser. Coming from Montélimar, you'll catch up. - And Yusuf... - He's gorgeous. He's dating Tara. Hands off. - Who's Yusuf? Tara's boyfriend? - Poor guy! - They go to Cabanis? - Marco's hot. He's with... And Danny, Dani, or whatever. - Dan. Quit saying Danny. - You're friends? No, but I know him. Dan, it's weird. He's hot but a real dick. - The thing I hated most today... - PE. Why do you say that? I know you. As usual, it's PE. - You didn't get into trouble? - No. - Know what? Trouble at school... - Watch out. Ms. Roux says she'll keep it in check. I'm just saying, any trouble... You say it every day. You've no idea. I've no idea what it's like but this year if the Principal calls me, saying there's trouble, boarding school for you. Same story since 6th grade. I get it. Remember, last year... - 8th grade's important. - The teachers disrespect me. The teachers? Do you respect them? Sure, at first, all the time even. - At first? - No! All the time. And they disrespect me. Like Ms. Abeille. She's gone, so there's no excuse. For sure. I heard the new art teacher gets owned by students. It's no reason to take advantage. - I'm just saying. - You always say that. It's annoying. You judge without the facts. I don't judge, I know you. You don't, mom. I'm different at school. You understand? Brush your gums. - Yes. - Alright? - There you go. - It stings. You're as good as new. No, Emma, don't answer that. Show us your smile. Smile! Great, I'll send it to your brother. And dad. You eat like a little piglet. Let me see again. You're exaggerating it now. - No. - I think so. But no. What time is it? It's not time yet. Twenty to. Manon isn't there. It's not quarter-to yet. Come on now, Emma. - Eat properly... - How about leaving some gaps? - Don't say that. - Seriously? I'm just explaining you won't rush me. I'm eating my lunch. - I'll leave without you. - Do that and I'm telling you... I have the printout in the car for your presentation. I'd appreciate some amenability. You're a real pest, my girl. Be quiet. Emma, you leave your scores on the table. And your shoes are absolutely always in the middle. It's inadmissible. I'm not your Conchita, my girl. Too early. - You're early. - Sorry. Back up slightly. Stop. What are you looking at? Sit down there a moment. In your own words, what's the song about? What am I trying to say? You have overall meaning, a context. Great, but you need more to perform the song. She has lots of doubts. Such as? Why she's doing this, no? By the way, Anaïs, I checked your grades. You're dipping below average. Results... So... - Art, 13/20. - What's that? Music... Killing it. Nailed music, mom. - Music gets you nowhere. - Gets me nowhere? Come on, what use is math if I want to write mangas? - French, 9/20. - Wait, I got a 10.5! - Latin, 9/20. - Who cares! - English, 10. - That too. - Spanish, 16/20. - See, 16! - Math, 7.5. - Big deal. Biology... 10.5. Technology, 4.5! Congratulations! You won't get into high school. Look at my grade in... You know what dad and me said. Yeah, right. No. The ball's in your court. Improve your average. Is improving my average gonna fly with me? Like I care about technology. Come on. Don't give me that. Techno, really. Techno, what's the point? Like I'm gonna build houses. The guy wants us to draw a treasure map. In art class! A treasure map, mom! Math. Pythagorean theorem. How am I gonna learn Pythagoras when the teacher never makes sense? The guy goes, Conceivably... Conceivably! Start by learning the definition of the theorem... - If he gave it to us. Very funny. - Look it up. I know one formula, c=a+b. The only one I know. Ready, Emma? I'll wait in the car. Lock the door and don't forget the key. - What time is it? - Ten to! I told you. It's like this every morning. - Whatever. - No, not whatever. - Stop! - Lucky I have today off. Or else I'd be late. Quiet! - You need to ask for a late slip. - Yes. What's the point of school for you? To be a success. I dunno, I mean... To have more knowledge. Will it help you write mangas? It depends. Depends on the mangas. School gives you tools, in fact. Tools that come in handy throughout life. So you must stick at it. I see you don't do your homework at home. No, at the center, near where I live. How come? I get help. There's a math teacher, an English teacher... You go to them for help? - Yes. - Alright. There we go. Common traits... Known as unique characteristics of the human race.... - So how do you say I suppose? - I don't know. All yours, my girl. Look it up. I don't know how. - You don't know how? - In your Spanish thingy. - Emma, please. - I don't know! A dictionary is a dictionary is a dictionary. Let go. - I'll do it. - Do it then. So what are you going to say? In your own words. Words you've learned. There, my girl. Go ahead, there. - I'm not a child, you know. - Stop doodling, just do it. It's my page. With words you learned, please. Hold on! Well? Nació? Yes, so? - I put one on. - Not nacío. Nació! Alright then, I put the thing... Nació. - Yes, so? - Accent on the o! - Puede? - You said puede. First person singular of the verb poder? - Podemos. - Podemos? First person singular. I... Podemo... Conjugate it. Podemo... - Podemo? - I don't know. It's annoying! What are you writing? You said puede. Make your mind up. Try to... - Be quiet and let me think. - We thought about it. - We already thought... - We didn't. I did, you didn't. - It's not my work, it's yours. - So don't say I. - We thought it through. - Stop! Hey there. Look at me. Pipe down, he's with his brother. I wish I could do that. She's back. Awesome board. Same board as Ryan Sheckler. Awesome, her hair blowing in the wind. It's like no one dares bother her. A real pro. She only started 4-5 months ago. Really? How'd she learn to do it? Self-taught. - This one's nice. - Let me see. - Don't like it. - Why don't you? I just don't. I think it's pretty and it's... Every time, she says no. - She needs to try it. - Then you like it. - That's right. - Try it on, my girl. No, I'll pass. Don't you think this is too big for her? I don't like it anyway. - Try it on. - Exactly. See how you look in it. And on the back here, you see... - I think it's pretty. - The writing's... - And this? - Low-key. No, I don't like it. Put some heart into it, at least. - This one's pretty. - No. Just try it on. Look, Emma... I don't like it. I won't try it on, it's ugly. - Looks good on you. - I don't like it. You told me yesterday. I get it. Stop harping on about it. Look, every time we talk, you make no effort. Alright, ok. No way I'm going to a clinic. What did Dr. Petrea tell you? I don't know. What was it she told you? Tell me exactly what she said. She said, You're extremely pretty, but you need to lose some tummy. Why? 'Cause I was beautiful? She said so. Why? Like I remember everything people tell me. But I think you don't want to remember. - How come? - Because it's hered... - Genetic. - That's right, genetic. - She said I'm extremely beautiful. - Sure, you can be beautiful and slim. You'd be even prettier if you lost a little weight. Hold on, I was a teen once, like you. Sure... - You already told me. - Sure, I was bigger than you. Honestly, my mother didn't give a damn. I ate and I kept eating between meals. I never watched what I ate, never listened. Maybe I take after dad. He was slim, right. Hold on, right now, you don't take after your dad. I do. No, I kept eating and getting bigger, and I didn't see I was getting bigger. I was happy in my skin. People said, You're fat, you're fat. I didn't give a damn. Look now... Where I'm at. Well, Anaïs, this term, you kind of gave up. Your grades are down. Starting the year, your average was modest in many subjects. At the end of it, your results really are a cause for concern. In French, especially. The teacher notes that you try, with a good attitude in class. Trouble is, you don't work hard enough at home. Nobody objected to you continuing into 9th grade, but take a good look at your results so far. I know! Let's get dad to take a photo. Yeah, head on. I'll try to jump with you. And dad snaps all four of us. Cover pic on facebook. 1, 2, 3... Jump worse than high. Happy birthday to you, Anaïs... You can't work a lighter anymore. - Come on. - It won't light. That's great. Thank you! So you're 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old. 10 years old! A child again. Did you see that film... 16 Wishes? Maybe. I think I'm gonna write my wishlist. About some girl who makes wishes? She has a list of all she wants to do before she's 16. Her birthday's coming up, with lots still to do, but thanks to some magician woman, all her wishes come true. Yeah, I saw it. Seriously, it doesn't get any crazier than the dreams I have. - Same here. I wrote them all down. - Yeah. No, mom! Don't give in or he'll never listen. That's his share. His afternoon snack. So he can scoff anytime? Yes, unless he asks for more, I don't give him anything. What's up? It's not a whole one every time. Wasn't it just two choccies? A gummi bear, same difference. I do what I want. - Afterward... - He'll be like you. Afterward, when I babysit... No, the fact is, your brother babysits you. - No, I babysit him. - Really? Yesterday, healthcare cards all over the floor. The dog ripped something to shreds. Yesterday, I was half-asleep on the TV. On the whoa... - So your brother babysat you. - No, I babysat him. He was strapped in his seat. I could have let him run wild. - What? - All morning, strapped in? Sure. He didn't say a word. At least, I think. I can't even... You're 15 and I can't even... No, he sat in his seat and wanted to be strapped in. - So I did. - Honestly, upgrade your brain. You don't believe me? You weren't there. This'll get on my nerves. - What did I say about your allowance? - All summer, I was with Timéo. - Getting on my case again. - No, I'm not. I said if you keep talking to me like one of your friends, no allowance. And dad ignoring me when Benjamin's here? How you talk about Benjamin! "The retard, the spazz." That's why dad gets annoyed. You never talk nicely about your brother. Never! We won't dump Benjamin... Yeah, so much easier to dump me onto a foster family. Dump you? Onto a foster what? Who wanted me fostered as a kid? You did. And why? Why? I was happy with them. - Tell me. - Like I know. I was 8 years old. Because you kept insulting me. Starting tomorrow, all your tests and exams count toward the junior high certificate. So you need to get down to work now, quickly and seriously. Work gets you everywhere. But if you don't work, if your grades don't improve, I'll tell you, you need to be honest with yourself. Be realistic, admit to yourself, I can't work, I don't want to. So why go to high school with twice as much work? Perhaps she's right, it's February, I can't do this. So I'll consider my options. Don't cheat! Can you take a look, please? Everybody else, if you've finished, keep it down. High school and CAP, it's not the same thing? No, there's... I can't do a childcare CAP at high school? If you do a childcare CAP, it's an occupational program. - So they're not the same? - No. To become a... For what I want to do, I need a childcare CAP. It says so. - To work in a school? - Elementary or kindergarten. You need a vocational high school. One loser going to trade school, that's me. And you guys in regular school. You got your jacket? - You have your phone? - Yeah. Overall, I'm very happy for you, my girl. Awesome. I am. They gave out books already? You have a lot to carry? It'll be heavy? What? Yeah. She's nuts. Anaïs. This morning, I signed you up at the Conservatory. - Dance is on Mondays. - Great. I won't do it. Taking a reduced program isn't good for musicals. Just not dance. There's one guy who was really good... He got an audition for a top dance school and stuff. It's not what you want. Imagine it is. Imagine I don't make it in singing. I need a fallback option, in an artistic field. - Sweetheart. - It's not funny. Like a scene from a war. In downtown Paris. Just after 11 this morning, two hooded men kill a police officer in cold blood and flee while justifying their attack. Revenge for Mohammad! Death to Charlie Hebdo! Charlie Hebdo's HQ has been attacked. Inside, first responders find the bodies of another officer and several journalists. Charb, the magazine's chief editor. Cartoonists Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski are among the victims. Shock and consternation. Later, the PM chaired a crisis meeting and the terror threat was raised to its highest level. In the last two hours, crowds have gathered in silence all over France. Many candles and one simple message, I am Charlie. Words of support on the day of the most murderous attack in France for decades. Can you joke about everything or should you be careful, depending on the subject or person it's aimed at? I'm asking you. You can joke about everything but not with everybody. It depends who. If I'm with Nidal and joke about Arabs, he might take a joke worse from me than from an Arab, about religion. What do you think? Same as Emile. I mean... I don't know. You can laugh about everything as long as there's respect, like Anna said. We must avoid the vicious circle of keeping quiet just in case this or that. Where does that come from? There's a key word here. Fear. You can't be afraid. Or else it's pointless being alive. Can a nation live, or a society evolve, in fear and anxiety about what might happen? You know what I said about Zineb... And how she reacted... Later, she told me it was because of the conflict in Palestine. And she said it 'cause he was Christian or something. No, Jewish! She thought Charb was Jewish or something. - Thing is... - I don't get it. I asked why she said she wasn't Charlie. She said 'cause of Palestine. I asked, how is that relevant to France? She said, Charb's Jewish. I said, He's not Jewish. He's an atheist. She said, No, he's Jewish, so he insults Arabs. She said the worst thing of all is religion. But he's an atheist. - What's atheist? - When you don't have a religion. I'm a Christian. Me too, but it's no reason to pick fights with people. Totally. - Listen! - No religion's smart enough to stop. You're so annoying. Since the dawn of time, wars are almost always over religion. So I'm not saying that will stop. But, sorry, Muslims didn't do it. - The Kouachi brothers... - Do what? Listen! The Kouachis converted. They started out Christian. First off, they're French. Firstly! And secondly... It's not Muslims. It's jihadists and terrorists. Don't lump together terrorist and Muslim. It's not the same! Know what? Like Emma said, the beautiful thing is that inside that Jewish supermarket, who had the idea to hide people someplace to protect them? And hid with them? A Muslim. So don't say Muslims are horrible. Muslims were just as affected as France. Folks go off about Muslims. What the hell did they do? Imagine we got called out in every country. Imagine people saying, Yeah, those Frenchies... It's gotta stop. What's with the Muslim thing? I don't get it. It's a religion like ours. Just a religion. I can't stop, Emma! Don't go, you're kidding me! Goofball attempt at romance, huge fail. No, thanks, not with you. Look... Like I have three feet. Hey, hey, hey. Just out of curiosity, where did you rank César? César gets maybe 14 or 15/20. I'd give him 17.5/20. Is that all? That's all? Perfection doesn't exist, kiddo. Even Nathan doesn't score 20. For sure. He's hardly spectacular. You got that, too? - Even Esteban doesn't score 20. - For sure. So what can we say about point P? Anaïs? What can I write? AP equals... I'm asking Anaïs. Equals what? Check she paid attention. - 3/7. - Equals... 3/7! - Yes? - 3/7. 3/7. Three graduations of seven. Three-sevenths of AB. - Easy-peasy. - My pleasure. For divisors of 48, all numbers can be divided by 1, so you put 1, with 48 right at the end. Then you try by 2, by 3... Anaïs, I'm not at all pleased. I don't see you paying attention or taking an interest. Let's get down to work. She gets on my nerves, really gets on my nerves. Everybody on their own, without talking. Fucking bitch. She drives me totally batshit. I prefer Mr. Bourdon, three times over. Esteban, you copied it down? Let's get to work. Anaïs! - I need my calculator. - I'm watching you. - What did I do? - That's just it, nothing. Lots of people are talking, not just me. I'm gonna... She's pushing my buttons. All those days watching from the windows All those years outside looking in All that time never even knowing Just how blind I've been Now I'm here blinking in the starlight Now I'm here, suddenly I see Standing here, it's all so clear I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light Toward Marie. And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright And the world has somehow shifted Emma, Dimitri... Manon, Dimitri... - Did you call me Emma? - I said Emma, then Manon. C'mon, gimme a break. I wanted to check something. Stand there. - Stand there. - Ok, I admit it. - Burn! - I admit defeat. Boom! Aren't you scared they'll say your grades aren't good enough for high school? Unlikely, but you never know. I dunno. Sure. Without them saying it, I'm scared. Getting into regular high school stresses everyone out. Especially me, I mean... - Everything stresses me out. - With 12/20 average, you're in. I love your scent. Swear to god, I can't get over it. Look at her. Look how focused she is. A geek. Look at me when I talk to you. You said to look at you. Seriously, I'm stressed out about what they'll say. - I'm scared I'll have to repeat a year. - No way. Sulking. - Give me a kiss. - You'd like that? Lift your head up. - Pain in the ass much? - I can't bend my neck. See, I didn't blow you off. "I can't bend my neck." But I really can't. - That's tired you out. - Not a bit. Weakling. You're the weakling. I have an old man's body. I ache all over, all the time. Dad wants me to stop handball. Bummer. - What? - Why? He says I get too many injuries, it's intrusive and stops me studying. - So, no choice. - Life's about making choices. I won't ever get married. - Why? - It sucks. A woman predicted my brother would never have a wife, just tons of girlfriends. That's great, someone who understands life. None of the crappy commitment of marriage and all the fun. Come on. What does your mother do? Works for the government in a tax office. A tax inspector, to be precise. And your father? Sales executive. Shit boring, but hey. - A job's a job. - He's never home. - What? - He's never home, and when he is... My dad's not home a lot either. At one time, my mom neither. Mom's always been there. I bet I failed. It's not stress, just... - Even so. - It's not the end of the world. Wherever the list is, my gut is churning. - "Certificate results!" - Here goes. - C'mon, Anaïs. - I'm gonna die. If I failed, I can't look Dimitri in the eye. - That's "passed with merit." - I may not even pass. You passed? With merit? - You got it with merit? - Yes, I did! Great. Now look for me. - Don't tell me, show me. - Quit stressing out. - I'm not stressed out. - Hold on. You can look now. Excuse me. - Where? - Hold on... - Where am I? - There. Anaïs Chambeaudie. "Chambeaudie, Anaïs Elodie." - That means I got it? - Yes, you're in. I'm so relieved, it's insane. - How the heck did I pass? - Never doubt your ability. Good job, guys. The more we're together, the better it is. In every way. Great. It's so much fun, he cracks me up, you have no idea. It slays me. Too bad, Esteban's with someone. You'd be so cute together. You feel anything for him? Nothing. Look, pebbles! I'm not asking for charity I won't bother you long I just want a bit of water To skip some stones I was wondering... For you, what's the ideal age for your first time? Any age, to be honest. - Everybody says that. - As long as you're ready. - They're attacking me! - Not age 10, though. - For a guy, it's more... - It's not the same for boys. Around age 15 or 14 for them. And 16 for girls. - It's young for a girl, 15 or 14. - I'd say 17-18 actually. But hey... If I do it this year, you'll think I'm... It depends on you, if you're ready, who you're with... People always tell me age is no issue as long as you're ready. Imagine it's idyllic with one guy at 16, and never the same with the others. - You're not going to wait, right? - Absolutely. You think it's idyllic, me and Dimitri? Sure, come on. And you go back a long way. How do you define idyllic? I don't know, it's... If you were me, you think you'd feel ready at 16? No. I mean, you know what I mean... I really have no idea. Hold on, "I have no idea" is what I said to Dimitri. Anyway, just so you know, I'm a good girl. Got a message. - Everybody's depressed on snapchat. - Word. Even on facebook, it's shitty. Sounds like a total buzzkill. You have taken the vocational route. It's a step-up from middle school since you encounter the world of work. You will do internships, your first steps in the world of work. You need to grasp that from this year on, You will already be expected to be professionals. Expect a lot of work, obviously. Usually, effort equals success. Our graduation rate this year was at least 95%. On the arts side, 95%. 96% in sciences. That's our pass rate. So the school has a good track record. If you work. Didn't I call it just right? I called those classes. Yeah, especially that you'd be in a class with Esteban. And not with you. This year's gonna drag by. Filthy bitch! Don't run, Anaïs, you'll do yourself an injury. Hold on, truce! Do I have chalk on my back? Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. Let's choose a dimension to observe it. What dimension is observable? - What's a good size, do you think? - 1,000? - 1,000 what? - 3,000! - Meters? - 1,000 kilometers. So, with a diameter of 1,000 km, we draw it on the wall? - It won't fit. - 1,000 meters. - 6 meters? - 6 meters! If Mercury's 6 meters, how big are the others? - Decimeter? - Still too big. - Centimeters? - Yes. Millimeters are too small. So we take 1 cm... So, for Mercury, we'll set the diameter at 1 cm. What's the biggest distance in the solar system? From the sun to the most distant planet. - Which is? - Not Uranus, the other one. I'll give you a mnemonic. My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos. - Nacho? - You said Nemo last time. Neptune! - Neptune. - Nacho? Sir, sir, sir... Neptune is the last planet but it starts with an N. You said Nacho, which ends in O, not N. It's the first letter, you spazz! What a moron! You tire me out. - Concentrate now! - A real moron. - Océane! - I didn't calibrate my voice yet. If in doubt about the volume, best keep quiet. Shit! Sorry... And polite. She has a problem with her voice, too. He dumped me over the phone, the coward. All the girls say it's a lack of respect. He disrespected me. So I was at Fanny's... I got a call, "private number." He was calling on his best friend's number. And he's like... I'm like, are we still together? He says no. I ask why. He says he's sick of it all. So I hung up and started to... I broke down in tears on Fanny's bed. Fanny hugged me and everything. I texted him to tell him he was a coward, doing it by phone. His best friend's mom calls up, threatening me. - Like, butt out! - She threatened you? I mean, saying Lydie might file charges, I was in big trouble, crap like that. - How old are you? - 16. - She says he's underage. - Because you're not underage? I'm over the age of consent, unlike Dimitri, but it's not the law. The doctors say so, not the law, so I'm not in trouble. The cops have better things to do. - If she wants to play games... - I'll go along. Laugh at the cops giving her shit. Anyway, it's her fault. It was at her house. I was against you sleeping together. But I miss him. You'll find another one. Even better. Let's speed it up or we'll never finish. Here are the answers. Look through them this weekend. And you'll understand. He's good for one thing. Giving us the answers. I had a teacher just like him, in 7th grade. Loved his job but sucked. When the function is constant, it is called monotone. "Silence was everywhere; something sweet came from the trees. "She felt her heart beat again. "Blood coursed through her like a stream of milk. "Then she heard, far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, "a vague, prolonged cry, a voice that lingered. "She listened in silence as it mingled like music to her pulsating nerves." Flaubert takes up position at the heart of his character to convey to us the emotion Emma Bovary feels at this moment. Something in the perspective changes. As if in a state of total availability, she found... a note of melancholy. Let's speed it up. Squeeze with your legs. Keep them trotting, your horses or ponies. Let's go, Anaïs. Trot. Just a trot. Oscar! What's happening? Sir! I'm pregnant. What's happening? In this period, which is so painful, so serious, so decisive for our country, I call for unity and composure. France is strong, and even though we may be wounded, we always gets back on our feet. France is solid, France is active. France will triumph over barbarity. What we are defending is our homeland, and the values of humanity. I call on you to show that indispensable unity. Long live the Republic, long live France. Thank you. I woke up thinking I'd had a nightmare. It's nothing new, it's been like this for years. We have to face facts. We're at war. We heard that last year too. No bayonets or trenches doesn't mean it's not a war. I agree and I think it's a political taboo. They should just say we're at war, period. They should stop saying this or that, and put a name to it. My father's in the army and he had to join his unit today. Mom and I are sick of it. It's a pain, living like this. When will your father be home? You don't know how long he'll be gone? It's open-ended? Most likely, he won't be back for Christmas. The bomber at Stade de France was 17. That's not supposed to exist. At 17, you want friends and a family. They say, we're your family. You have a God now, "God" in quotes, who'll stand by you. When you die, you get everything, but no. It's bullshit so they get cocky, they trick them and do what they want. You're revolted? It's a pain in the butt, pisses me off. - Are you scared? - Yes, I'm scared. Ethan, concentrate. Annette, same goes for you. Adèle! Stop that, concentrate. Lena, do your sock and stop talking, or you'll never finish. Enzo... Hey there. You're hot. You're sweating. You ok, champ? Nathan... Who's your sweetheart? - You are. - I am? Antonin! Put your coat on. Bring me your coat. See, you should've listened. Come here. Why don't you listen though, Lucas? You're our new job shadow so the children are very... affectionate. You want to give so much, which is great, but now you need to learn to... To hold back that impulse to give. So you can establish a little more distance. You see? Yesterday, when you woke up Enzo, for example... You wake him up, you engage with him. So what I mean by distance is, you wake him but you don't engage with him for yourself. You see, the bond works both ways. At that particular moment, you cannot... You don't possess the child. - I overinvest with them. - Yes, you overinvest. The children here, we're there for them, but it's not about attachment. Kindliness and affection, yes, but not attachment. You see what I mean? You grasp the difference? And I know that. Sometimes I try to... To hold back, but at times... Because you're naturally generous and you enjoy it. Could be worse. Tomorrow, yes. At 12:45 at the hospital. And 2:30 at the church in Chapelis. 64 years old. Do you want to see Granny before Monday? Yes. Monday, it will be packed out at the morgue. So Monday I know if I'm staying outside or going in. She's normal, like she's asleep. Just cold. When I touched her at the hospital, she was cold. Now, she's normal, like she's... How can I put it? Like... Sleeping. - Except you know she's not sleeping. - Exactly. I didn't even tell her I loved her. You did. You'll have no regrets. Life isn't fair. That's right. It feels weird, this happening to us. You think it only happens to others, so when it happens to you... It's weird. Honestly, this is the worst year of my life. 2016, not my year. So abide by all our hygiene rules, including in the kitchen, washing your hands, suitable clothing, and disinfection of all surfaces. Next, two types of milk, or even three types of milk, that can go in bottles. Powdered milk, liquid milk and mother's milk. See, I'm not heavy. No, don't you dare go there. - I'm staying here. - You'd better. Now, the double spinning top. - You're all tired out. - We're not tired out. It's only 9 o'clock! Here we go! - Go slowly at first. - I'm gonna die! Happy birthday to you! Whoa, Ferkan! She's wet enough now! How did Mr. Beckman seem to you? Fine. As usual, he did his morning workout. I see. And Mrs. Saulnier was hospitalized? Yes, she was taken in this weekend... - She wanted to commit suicide. - Really? Yes, by jumping out the window, drowning in the river. - So she's in the hospital? - Weeping non-stop. Morning, Mrs. Giliock. - Did you sleep well? - I suppose so. I slept part of the night, then I kept being woken up. Your back pain again? Yes, back pain again. My back gives me lots of pain. And one. And two. Let's go. The ladies are faster than you. Here we go! Women like lifting their legs up. I saw that one coming. Now one arm up to the ceiling. The other to the floor. And switch. Look up at your raised hand. From early in the year, way before my internship here, I told my teachers, not a chance. Children, period. - Only children. - I'm not saying I'll... Yes, make it your profession. It's not a final decision. My thing was children, only children. - And now? - It took two days. Two days! After two days here, I think I prefer the elderly. Great. I can feel myself maturing, understanding things better. Understanding life better and... In adolescence, something changes. I feel I'm reacting more like an adult, or young adult, I guess. Ma'am! - Enjoying it outside? - It's nice. Yes. It does you good to get out, Mrs. Pécou. Our species came into being more than 200,000 years ago. Gradually we became a multi-planetary species, constantly pushing back the frontiers of knowledge. It's a choice not to be on your own, Emma. - It's true. - I don't see how. Sure, it is. If you're cool with people... Sorry, we're always cool with people. They're jerks, that's all. - If you take that attitude... - It's the truth. - It isn't. - It is. - Isn't. - Is. Stop it! Don't start that again, seriously. Even so. So stop talking about it. Goodness, my girl! In some ways, it's worthwhile to live on your own. It's character-building, you know. Anyway, you won't be on your own. Sorry? - I'm not used to it, like you. - Like us? You'd say we're on our own? It's absurd. Once again, it's up to you to decide... You say that but some don't get to choose. - Choose what? - Not to be alone. However hard they try. I don't mean me but there you go. Honestly, I don't see how. Some people are just petty and turn their backs on people. They enjoy seeing people suffer. - Being alone isn't suffering. - I didn't say that. For some reason, some people struggle to make friends. It just takes 2-3 people to give you a hard time and the others are like sheep. They tag along and everyone joins in. You're kind of right. It's frowned upon to be out of the ordinary. That's for sure. But in the end, if you're not a bit different, you just get bored. So you're better on your own? It depends. It sucks being on your own. To our Mommy To our Grandma - What about the vacation? - I went to Spain. A week at a resort. Super cool. And you? Well, my mother had a nervous breakdown. A week after my internship, she was taken to the hospital. So I looked after my brothers for a month and a half. Alright. That was my thrilling summer. She's feeling better? She's getting there. Rested up. And when school starts again, it'll be easier for her, on her own. Daytime, she won't have Timéo. And Benjamin will be back at school, so that's good. So here's the... You can see it from here. You were keen to have it but... - That's an 11th grade schedule. - I'll kill myself. Happy, Anaïs? No Mr. Cosset. You'll come to class? You'll need your uniform, starting tomorrow. Tomorrow, we do all it says here? Yes. Friday with me and Ms. Rouffange. - I've got your suitcase. - Ok, baby. I don't need to tell you, the operation isn't magic. Ok. Since you already had a band. Then you also had part of your stomach removed. And the results were not always satisfactory. That's right. It's about a commitment to following through. Ms. Lopez told me. Even now, it's not too late if you want to take a step back. - It's not urgent. - I'm absolutely full-on. We're not ready, but she is. So if all goes well, she's out Friday? Let's not put the cart before the horses. It's not an operation for appendicitis, removing the appendix to solve the problem. We will change the anatomy, physiology of your organism. It's a new beginning, a new story from now on. Well, it's a pity for you. I did not say yes. How do you expect me to react to your politics, your neediness, your trifling stories? For I say no to all that repels me. I am sole judge. While you, with your crown, your guards, your paraphernalia, you merely have me killed by your yes. Will they wake mom today? I doubt it. It didn't go well. I'm going there later. - I'll come with. - Sure. She has tubes everywhere. For her own good. She looks like she's asleep. No stress. She can hear you. She's in a coma. Hopefully, she'll be fine. Emergency Room She's in Unit 2? - What are Units 1, 2, 3? - The same. Sector 2 here. Mr. Chambeaudie, here to see my wife. - Yes, come in, sir. - Thank you. Ugly player you gave me. - I can change him? - Yeah! Don't bother. Is that the taxi? Dad, look, I'm the best. - Red light! - Outta my way! Like you stop for them. - Me yes. - Out the way. Not sure you'll get a license. Mom? At the hospital. I'll swerve. Watch and learn. Jump there. Don't worry, I've got this. Dad! - Where did you live before? - 7, Marcel Pocaly. - So you're... - Yes. Alright, I understand. That's terrible luck. It's not about me. It's about you two. For 4 months, I've kept it all inside. When educators said I tyrannized you and put you in danger, did I like it? They were right. I'm not kidding, dad. I'm not. - You think I liked hearing that? - They said it, not me. You only listen to them when it suits you. So when I catch shit... 4 months now, whatever I do, good or bad, I catch shit. Don't deny it. It pisses me off. There comes a time, I'm 17 now... Try to understand. I'm a teen and for 4 months... For 4 months, I've had no social life. Pisses me off. You can say, teen issues, who cares? But don't you think I have real problems to handle? I feel bad already 'cause usually I have Timéo in my bed. The day I'm not there, a fire starts. - Stuff happens. - It's not just that. It's like you guys don't care what I feel. I'm sad and you guys don't care. How many times did you bawl me out for crying over Dimitri? You bawled at me to stop. - You never had your heart broken? - I wasn't like you, thank god. You're going on 18 and you... It's no reason to ignore my feelings. No, but you don't talk so... Crying over Dimitri screams sad. I didn't eat, didn't talk. I stayed home. We said so to the educators and social worker. - What did they do for me? - That's them. I mentioned it. This may sound selfish, but no one did anything for me. Funny, when you want to work in films, everyone thinks actress, not about the other jobs. It's true. - You changed. Before you wanted... - No, I never... You wanted to be director of photography. - You thought I wanted to direct. - Or director. - No, I never said that. - You did. We ran into a girl I was at school with, as kids. She said I always wanted to be an actress, so... It's really the first I've heard of it. Stop it. Everyone knew except you. If you took an interest... - It was the big revelation this year. - Not at all. Let's keep it simple. The 3 top jobs in movies ranked 1-3, which comes first, second and third? - I said actress. Keep up. - And what then? Then screenwriter. That's it, period. - Quit bugging me. - Bugging you? - Shit! - Goodness! If you took an interest in your kids, come on! You'd know what everybody knows. I always said what I wanted to be. Quit bugging me. I'm not bugging you, am I? Don't get so worked up. You always gotta be right. You're wrong. - I don't see how she's wrong. - She is. Digs her heels in, won't budge. Extraordinary. We discussed this. I always said it. It's your problem. Let's talk normally, without you getting angry, crying... You don't give a damn. I don't give a damn? That's just great. Don't pretend you're interested. Anyway, with the direction you appear to be taking, for sure, yes. Go to college and you flunk for sure. - For sure. - Honestly, stop! - What? - Stop winding me up, honestly. - Just stop. - Fine, I'll shut up. So, change subject? - Music? - No, please, spare me. Her music theory exam. Now that's something else. You don't get that I only did 18 months of theory. - We get it but I don't see... - Yes, but I can't... I can't catch everybody up in two days. If I don't feel up to it, I won't do it, period. - I don't feel up to it. - Alright. I'll go and burst into tears. I'm not going, no way. What I think basically is that you really are... a bit lazy. You need to face facts, Emma. Face facts. I can't do it, I'm no good. Stop it! Mom, what do you want? Quick! - Checking you're ok. - Not great. How come? Your husband couldn't care less about his kid. Like that, so I can see better. See, he doesn't give a shit about me. I'm sick as hell. At times in class, I could hardly breathe. I was terrified. You guys don't care. No medication, nothing. I'm dying. See? Fucks given, zero. Reaction time, minus 50. - You bugged out? - I bugged, yeah. The longer it goes on, the harder it gets. But anyway, you gotta adapt, right? Say what you like, you don't give a shit, whatever. You're obviously stuck on Dimitri. Obviously. I refused to admit it, but I'm stuck on Dimitri. I didn't tell you all about his mom but it was tough at the end. It was hard to take. Basically, Dimitri was my safe space when it was messed up at home. I lost that, it was awkward at Dimitri's, so I had no safe space. And then I didn't feel right anyplace. Since I broke up with Dimitri, nowhere feels right. It sucks at home, sucks at my cousin's, sucks at school. It just feels like I have nowhere to go. We can feel the tension rising. This is where Marine Le Pen will speak after 8 pm, when the results are announced. Not much atmosphere there. They're all jerks anyway. No, you can't say that. Long faces there. France's youngest president... Yeah, we get it. Historic moment. After a long, unpredictable campaign... I can't watch. France has made its choice today, Sunday May 7, 2017. Who will succeed François Hollande as head of state for five years? 10... 9... 8... Fuck, now we're in shit! Great, great, great! We're screwed. Asshole. Celebrations that contrast with the... - Rich bastard! - defeated National Front candidate. It's all for the rich. For this extremely solemn moment, Emmanuel Macron arrives, in the middle of the Napoleon courtyard. It brings to mind pictures of François Mitterrand... In '81, it was extraordinary. Now, it's nothing like the... The fervor of elections back then. People don't vote for an idea but for want of an idea, mostly. I don't know, it's odd. I don't know. Right? What do your friends say? Not much. You don't discuss it? No, they're all just... Some are for Marine. Most in fact. - Besides that... - I spent nights talking politics. When I was in high school, it was crazy. We debated. We held debates... We debated the debates. Sure but I get a handle on the issues and debates, and tune out. The main thing is to have ideas. I know but I don't go deep. I don't care. I told you, as long as it's not Marine, and it's all good, I don't care. - "All good"? That depends. - Gimme a break. I don't like Macron either, come on. This man here today, alone... Here you are. We lower the gurney. Have no fear. Tell me when you're ready. Let us do the work. That's right, gather your wits. Hold on, stay seated until we get it level. Tell me when you're ready. Alright, now. We'll hold your feet. - Very good. - Great job. Home sweet home. Don't worry, you'll be reunited with your son tonight. - Don't press on my tummy. - Sorry. What did you do today? That. How many texts? I told you. Two! How many left? Two. You're terribly annoying, my girl. You need to move up a gear. Let me explain just one thing. If you are in a comfort zone, you need to take enough time to re-read everything, honestly. I'll have time. 24 pages like that isn't complicated. Another three texts to come. Two. They don't take long, an hour each. Chill out. That's the worst. I'll screw up if you stress me out. - So it will be my fault? - Sure, you stress me out. When I'm stressed out, I'm useless. If you want me to get 0, keep going. The written exams, you backed off, and they went fine. You butt in, I mess up. No way. I add people, and there are less. Explain. What? I have nothing to explain. Don't eyeball my messages. - It's Dédé's brother. - Swear. I knew it, had to be. I gotta tell you. - Let me work this out. - It's Dédé's brother? I'll need to see him, but I think so. I knew it when I saw the last name. - I don't know if it's him. - I'm not sure but I think so. - Honestly, not the hottest. - Or ugliest. - Not the ugliest. - He's not bad, physically. Not impossibly slim, but me neither. Cut it out. Yeah, but if he's Dédé's brother... - In September, I'll hear about it. - Pay your way. He said I was cute, and I loved it 'cause I rarely get compliments. He gave me his number, we chatted, like getting to know each other. He texted me this about himself. I replied with the same. We have lots in common. Anaïs! Do a striptease for the person you find cutest. Hold on. - Or chug this. - No. If I do, I'll puke. Like we care! For your birthday, kiss a hot guy. Anaïs, I know you. Cut it out. Ok, ok, ok... She kissed him! She really did it! Léa kisses Ben. - Kiss Ben. - I'm a fag. Ben, I don't buy you're a fag. Léa, kiss Ben! That's gross. Straight in with her tongue. - Wastes no time. - I only gave him a peck. Pauline, kiss Romain. - Not a chance. - So drink. Anaïs, kiss the guy you like most. - We already had it. - Kiss the guy you like most. Up you get, I'll take you over. Romain, I'm sorry. With tongue. Are you serious? That is so cute! I love it! Anaïs hooked up! I didn't say I'm wasted. My head's spinning. Where's the toilet? - There. - Got it. Go on, they're ready for you. What's that there? Stretch marks. I've got some? I never heard of them. Yeah. - Really faint. - What does it mean? When you grow, your skin stretches and marks. - You have stretch marks? - On the inside. - What are they? - When your skin expands too fast. Like when you grow and stuff. Can you lose them? Yes, possibly. Or they can come back. Everybody has cellulite, everybody has stretch marks. It's human. Look, your buddy with the orange cap. He went to our high school. Alright! Save me, I'm drowning. Who's that girl chasing after him? Whoa, competition! - Nice and slow. - Yeah, nice and slow. Cross over. Faster! And stop! It's Jean. Isn't that Jean-Phi? Jean-Phi! Here comes Jean-Phi! What a looker! Shit, he's really buff. I told you yesterday that Jean-Phi had pecs. - Don't embarrass him. - We wave? Not yet. Jean-Phi, sex on legs! Zélia knows Jean-Phi. Manon too? No, Zélia wants Jean-Phi. - She wants Jean-Phi? - No, but he seems very sweet. Sweet but kinda shy. Jean-Philippe! She says you're hot AF! Chloé, a question. You live on your own? - It's not too hard? - It's ok. - I'm moving out, too. This month. - I pity you. I lived in an apartment for my course last year, but a couple days, not all the time. This is full-time, with the young adult program. - Like I've got? - Yes. I'm stressed out about the meeting. It's a popular program. - Your application needs to be... - Show you're committed. Give your situation from A-Z, lots of details, then you play it up to be sure you get on the program. Tell them that you're totally committed to studying to become whatever. It takes time. I got it... Apparently, if I get it, I move in ten days later. It pisses me off, you going. 'Cause I won't be here for Timéo? No, not that. I won't hear you griping anymore. I won't... If you want, I'll call every night to gripe. No, even if you gripe and you're a real grouch, you're my daughter. I'm not ready to see you go. I want to go. I've had it with being lectured, bawled at, criticized... I don't criticize you. Look, there are times you do stuff and don't clear up. - Not that fucking bowl again! - No, not the bowl! You get worked up over nothing. It pisses me off, you going. The concert begins in 3, 2, 1... Let's go! You're sure he won't think I'm a loser? Send it! I'm sending it to Capelas. He'll think I'm a loser. He won't, it's cool. Ok, sent. If he invites us over, we go. - What time? - Afternoon. - Too bad. - How come? No way? Really? - You won't do it tomorrow. - Tonight. Yeah, sure. - Sure. - Prove it. Let's see the call time. 34 minutes, fuck! You guys had lots to talk about. As for our pre-summer forecasts, I was right. - Which was? - I always said it'd be Zélia. Yeah! Just saying... We always said you first, Zélia second and me third. I won't do it with Antonin. - How come? - He doesn't turn me on. Obviously, next to Capelas, who turns you on like crazy. - Bullshit. - Like a kid in a candy store. Bullshit! Antonin's a real beanpole. The guy has no presence, thanks very much. You'd sleep with Baptiste, not Maxime? Sure. One's dark-haired and shaggy. The other not! Seriously, you rate the same style of guy by hairy legs or not? - They're not the same style. - They are! - Just because they both wear glasses. - Not at all. It's the dark hair, rugby, big butts. It's all that. - You gotta do what you gotta do. - Yeah. Let's talk final exams. It's an important event, you all agree? As years go by, it will seem less so, but right now, in 12th grade, it's the event that ends one thing and starts another. A transition. You'll have to think about the choices you'll make. "Where am I headed?" All that develops, obviously, according to your ability, your expectations and ambitions. What you want is also important. It's only natural for it to provoke worry or even anxiety. The thing is to think it through and do the best you can. Mom... - You don't care about my life. - You don't care about us. Moving out doesn't mean I don't care about you guys. Get real! You expect me to be here at 30? You're only 18. - You're 18. - At what age did you leave home? It was different for me. Do you love me? Give me a hug. Don't go. I love you. Don't go. Mommy. The team consists of three counselors who intervene as you need them. Naturally, there's the academic and professional angle. And relations with the family sometimes need work, too. There's also budget management. Anything related to independent living in an apartment. The aim is not to cut links with parents but to reinforce that bond because when the funding stops, your parents are your main resource. - I can invite my boyfriend or stay out? - Yes. So as long as... he's 18 or over. You told me earlier that he is. In that case, no problem. We really... You're an adult in your own home. There we are. I love shutters like that. - I'll open all the shutters. - Go ahead. There's a spider! No, I gotta insist. The first night you sleep with us. - Never! - Come on, please. - I'm not Manon! - Sleep down below, please. - Below? - You never know. We hardly know him. Imagine he's a creep. First night, I'll sleep below but not with you. Obviously. I'll be down below, you guys up top. - No, me up top, you down below. - What? In terms of the beds. Why? - It's a bunk bed? - Sure. - Downstairs. - No, upstairs. - You mean upstairs? - No, downstairs. Stop. Your mom will be upstairs. Good point. Do you feel ready or not? I don't know. I'm not thinking about it. You never know in advance. Thing is, if you picture yourself doing it... Only with Capelas. In that respect, sure. No kidding I picture it. Why Capelas? I don't know. I mean, he asked me. And I trust him more than... To know how to do it right. Experience! For a first time, above all. I'm such a softie. I don't know. I really don't know. What do you call the philosophical position that there is no truth? Skepticism. Perhaps everything is relative, there is no truth. Everything is probable, and nothing is absolutely certain. And so, where does belief come from? Why can I say "I believe"? Let's forget "I know." Why can I say where belief comes from? Tristan? All of you, think. Observation? Not bad, but even more precisely. Anna? Habit. It comes from habit. If ideas are put in your head, whether those ideas are true or false, you'll wind up believing them. I cannot not believe what I heard over and over. It produces effects, it produces mental images. The mind is a kind of soft dough, on which traces are imprinted. Why do I have prejudices? Why preconceptions? Because we were all... Children? Children before we were people. Alright? Jot that down maybe. Since we were children before we were people, we believed... Before we knew. It wasn't how I imagined it. I thought I'd be stressed out but I wasn't. No, seriously, it was fine. So... I was brave. So you didn't... Thing is, I don't like being touched. So it was a bit, you know... A bit what? It was new and a bit strange. Annoying. - Goofy? - I don't know... I preferred it afterward. Just holding the person in my arms is enough. And kissing's not really my thing either. I make the best of it. Everything's ok by me. Now. At any rate, it didn't change anything. Yes but... You're in love with him, though. I don't know. I stay on my guard. Reforging that bond is your job, too. Simple as that. But I can't do it. You need to try. Timéo is 5 years old. Age 5, you don't decree you don't love your mother. - I didn't say he doesn't love me. - It's tricky. You weren't around. I didn't say he doesn't love me. Before the operation, he was clinging to me. For a year now, he's been used to being with dad or me. It's only natural. When Granny was still alive, he was like Granny, Granny, Granny. I kept my distance. You see me there on the couch, keeping my distance. But why? Why? I wanted just one thing. - To be with Granny. - Exactly. It's selfish. I kept my distance... Selfish and stupid... Mom, you're strong. Get it together. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. It's shit for them. We're used to our Virginie always fooling around, always cracking jokes. And now you're not there. Be with us! Take me, I think what you need right now is to refocus on yourself. - Exactly... - So if you and dad want a weekend, I'll look after the kids and you have a romantic weekend. Yes, but first I need to get better. So focus on yourself. Do stuff for you. - Maybe it's hard for him. You're gone. - I know. Like me not seeing Romain. Your absence hits dad hard. He hardly sleeps since you went in. I know it's hard on him. It makes me feel awful. You have a family that loves you. Sure, he's a grouch... Are you listening? Take me, for example, Since the summer after 9th grade, Dimitri dumped me, I was in depression. A few months later, Granny died. Then the house burned down. You guys were hit hard by the fire but do you know how I feel? I was in the house with Timéo. Every night, including last night, I see the fire again, on a loop. It stops me sleeping. And I wonder, what if I hadn't reached Timéo? Could be that Timéo, knock on wood... He could have died in the fire while I was on the phone instead of watching my little brother. After I met Romain, he really helped me pick myself up. It's not all bad. It was a tough time for me but right now, I'm good. - Look at the Golden Mountains. - I'm looking, yes. I love this road. Really though, there's nothing special. Look at the signs. "Don't pass up snow plows." Great. You see one? With regard to the coach, Emma, you must be absolutely genuine, you... However, it's important you explain... I speak my mind without worrying about what he thinks. That's not the point. Let me finish! Can we communicate? You speak, I answer. - Certainly but... - Shit, you're infuriating. I could kill you. So infuriating. When you say you don't care what he thinks... Just don't tell me to be myself! My character is to be myself, so it's stupid. Let me talk, let me talk. When you say "contextualize," some questions are clearly about college, therefore already "contextualized." Point one. You make me flip my lid for no reason. Then, get some perspective on me with you guys, and others. I'm not at all the same. Don't worry, I can be very tactful. I see you refusing any kind of debate at home. Because you're shit boring. I debate with people who aren't pains in the butt. You guys are pains in the butt. Your voice annoys me. Can you imagine another possibility than cinema? Psychology might have interested me, too, but film is what I really want to do... If I don't make it, sure, but it wouldn't be my first choice. "I'm just scared of not succeeding, not gaining admission, "so I wind up having to do something by default." If you're admitted, you'll succeed? No, not necessarily. What worries you about not succeeding? The stress? No, it's just we don't all have talent. I mean, if everybody who wants to do something succeeds... Where there's a will, there's a way, sure, but it's not like... You express a certain lack of self-confidence. Yes. Despite your achievements in singing and film. Yeah, maybe. Your achievements at school. That's not enough to try to... To remedy this lack of self-confidence? I'm very insecure so... - Nervous about leaving your hometown? - Sure. A bit. I'm always with my mother and I'll see her less, which will be odd. We really need to get off our asses to file our E13 applications. and in art. In four weeks, final exams. Don't get depressed. I'm just not ready. With the grades I got. 2.5/20... Seeing it makes you want to cry. Looking at my grades, I got 1, 0, 4.5... I got 5.5... I'm laughing, but it's nervous. Well? We'll check. I didn't get a chance. I couldn't wait for you to get here. - Some kids in my class got 0 offers. - Really? - Only wait lists. - Actually, I'm more interested in you. I pity them. Look away, shut your eyes. Shoot. It's that or "access denied" and I have to change codes. Stop, maybe... It's all good, we're in. 3 offers. 10 wait list. 9 rejections. Let's start with the rejections. Not so fast. Do you mind, Emma? I got rejected for the elite stuff. Even... Even what was it? I'm on the wait list. For Limoges? And wait list... Let me see. Wait list for Versailles. Wait list, Limoges. Wait list, Edouard Herriot. And two in Paris. You're only on the wait list? - Everywhere? - Looks like it. The only offer I have is for film. Whoopee. There we go. It's the only place I have an offer. No... Law in Brive! Education Studies at the Catholic Inst. Basically, that's psychology. Gracious, it's a choice that gives you no choice. Screw that, I got what I want. - Don't wind me up. - Stop that! Just because I didn't get an elite school. Shit! - Don't deny it. - That's irrelevant. It's just that with motivation or whatever... Why are you so stressed out? I'm not. I don't get it. Like breakdown, the end of the world. No, not the end of the world, but it leaves you no choice. It's the one I wanted. It's not like only law school in Brive. Anyway, it brings out what people want for real. Did I shed a tear over not getting an elite school? I don't give one shit. So you see what people want. Imagine I got the film course and I'm like, that's all? I don't really want it. - Cool down! - It's annoying. Anyway, what do you care? Sorry, I'll pay for you in college. Of course I care. I want to do film! I'd like to know how many wait lists and where? Fine but later, 'cause this is annoying me. Be happy with what I got, then we'll see. Come on! That's really cool. It's cool, preaching parental tolerance, and you don't congratulate me for what I got. Great! Turns out you're the least tolerant, sorry. It leaves you no alternative. It's what I want, so who gives a shit! Jeez. I don't deserve you going off at me like that. - Sure you do. - Really? The thing is, it forces you to make a single choice. Imagine you don't like it, which... How long are you going to stress me out? - I'm not. - You are. I find it pathetic, that's all. - It's pathetic to say that. - It bugs me out. You bug me. I didn't ask your opinion. Mom, honestly, it's not cool. Stop now. We know you're not cool, great. Right now, only Paris accepted me. So there we go. So Paris for you, my girl. You'll have the choice between law at Toulouse or Gay-Lussac... And psychology. Psychology, you have an offer. Or else Paris. Your choice. A whole new life starting. Emma, for pity's sake, the map. Chicago. Boston, New York. Miami. Dallas. New Orleans. You're pointing to New Orleans in Florida. Careful, you pointed here. That's Florida. Miami, I said. Miami is in Florida. So here? - Go on... - Houston? No, not Houston. - Houston's in Texas. - So it's there. Texas isn't on the coast. Dallas, Houston, I don't know... Come on, instead of making it worse. I'm looking for your map. Pain in the ass. I learn it and it pisses me off. Another bad grade. Pisses me off. The bitch'll say I didn't learn it, when I did. Minneapolis really exists? That's just it. Shit, you're a pain! I won't work with you anymore. I apologize. It's nothing to be ashamed of, not knowing that. Make me out to be an airhead. I think I'll give up on the maps. - Try to understand. - I don't understand. I'm stressed out. I average 8/20 in history. Shit. It's not history, it's geography. History-geo is one subject. Stop it. One grade, not two. Please, mom, it's horrible. Core areas in the case of globalization. The hyper-core... Center core... - Of the... - Global area... No, I've had it with you. Forget it. Annoys me. I'll get a crap grade anyway. Not necessarily. We spent long enough on it yesterday. I can't take it tonight. Tonight, sure. - Stresses me out. - Stop now, let's have dinner then... I'll get 0, that's all. I have the dates, no more. Sucks ass. But I know nothing, absolutely nothing. I spent weeks studying, seriously. Non-stop, no breaks. But I don't get it. What's this now? It's beyond me, honestly. The European Union: territories in 2018? Technically, what are the chances of that coming up? I admit it, I'm super stressed out. You took the four little drops? ...messed up philosophy? - No, don't move. - I won't move. Ride it out or your feather won't be straight. - I won't move. - You can't. It needs to be aligned. I'll be fine. Good. No kicking now 'cause we're doing the words. Sorry, I didn't feel myself move. Hold on. It feels like it's on the bone. What are you doing? Tattooing you. Sweat's running down my face. Really? If you have a kid, you'll see. It'll be worse. - You're not bleeding. Hardly at all. - Really? Yes, look. If you can see it. - Love it. - Love it? My grandmother's part of my body now. - Hey. - You don't know your results yet? - Hey. - How are you? - We'll soon find out. - You don't know? - Class? - TL1. - You both have ID? - Yes. Thank you. - Enjoy your vacation. - Thanks, bye. Literature, 13. That's where I... 16 in history! 16 in English. 12 in my Spanish oral. English oral, 17. I hardly opened my mouth. Philosophy, 14. Damn! You, in philosophy? 13, I think, yeah. PE, exempted. Film studies, 16. Written, 16. Oral, 16. 16 for my project and 17. I was right. 14.86 as an overall average. 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Dédé, you passed? Dédé, wow! I passed? Did I pass? Come on, I can't see a thing! Get your results and go, please. Anyone see my name? I don't. I can't see my name. - Where are the C's? - I can't see me there. I can't see! Manon, you passed. I can't see my name. I passed with merit! Merit! I passed, Anaïs! Drinks on you at last! I got it with merit. I'm so happy. What did he tell you? - The teacher? - That I'd pass my finals. - With? - Merit. It feels great. - I'm so happy. I was sobbing! - Yes, it feels odd. Océane passed, too. Without merit, but she passed. I know. We're the best qualified in the family. Really? It's just us. - It's just great. - We'll celebrate. My baby. Yes, we have to celebrate. Champagne and all! - With Océane. - Sure. - It's all planned? - Fab. I passed! Go on, massage me. You're a good masseuse. Sure, pure talent. Lucky man, your future guy. Just listen to that giggle. And her popping out of her suit. No way. I don't like skanks like that. Can't be more than 14. At 14, I played with Pet Shop and Barbies. Yeah, it's totally changed. It's insane. Dude, my cousin in 5th grade has a cell. We lucked out. Yeah, we grew up at the best time, for sure. Not counting our parents' time. It was wicked, no cellphones. To go play, your friends came knocking on your door, - "Is Anaïs in?" - Or called your mom. - Always scared the folks would pick up. - Swear to god. Good times. We didn't even go on the computer. Now kids play on tablets. I got an hour on the computer. - Mad. I played dress-up for... - Me too! - Princesses and stuff. - Swear to god. Just dreaming up our lives. The good old days. Now, at 14... Out getting laid by the whole south coast. Me, at 14, my dress sense was in the gutter. I remember... I was wondering... Do you think like... Like you're going to Paris, and me to Limoges... - We'll meet up, you think? - Sure. - Or not at all? - We'll see each other. We will. I don't know, it'll feel weird. When we meet up, we'll be like so changed, see? Could be, we won't be the same. We won't know the same people. Yeah. - In any case, I'll miss you. - Same here. Don't talk about it, it makes me sad. I'll miss you. Stop, I don't like talking about... I'm like, who knows what'll happen next year? Yeah, but we need to discuss it at some point. Could be, we won't keep in contact. But when we run into each other in town, if you're in Brive and I am too, I'll shoot you a text, to hang out. I don't think we'll keep in contact. We'll always be childhood friends, like when we're old. Specially if we're back in Brive. Imagine we all wind up back here. Bumping into each other in the store with our kids. "How's it going?" "Mom, who's that?" "Mommy's childhood friend." "Is your son at d'Arsonval?" "No, he's at Bahuet. Remember Bahuet?" "You had your son there with Romain?" "It's over with Romain, Emma." Oops, flub! And my husband's there, like, "Who's Romain?" "A teenage sweetheart, don't worry." Could be, I'll wind up no kids, no husband, just me and a cat. I'll always have cats, that's for sure. I picture myself with a house, white dog, kids and husband. A nurse. The future freaks me out, actually. Because we're young and thrown into it. Imagine spending a whole year... I mean, still doing stuff, but with nothing to do, like a year off in Brive. You couldn't. Yeah. Anyway... We'll see where life takes us. You're taking that vile thing? Yes. It's not at all vile. It's completely... - That's summer-wear anyway.... - It's not. - Leave it. - In terms of space up there. I told you, there's plenty of space. Just folding it properly. You need to fit it all in.
