DEPARTMENT STORE Ground floor! - Excuse me, do you sell raincoats? - Third floor on the left. - There's an elevator. - Thank you. Seventh floor! Bargains, sales, offices. This way. When I found out that they wanted to take you on as an employee I spoke to the husband of the niece of the sister of an employee, who's friends with the Assistant Manager, who's close to the Managing Director. That's why they called me as well, because they want my word. And I'll vouch for you, just as long as you don't make me look silly, okay? - Gaetano, what do you want? - The director is waiting for us. - Good morning, Miss. - Morning, Gaetano. I have Mr. Bruno Zecchi here with me. A driver, the one from the accident. Ah, you're the one who almost killed the director? - No, it was him who almost killed me. - Yes, I was joking. - It looks like that position will be yours. - Of course, he'll have my word. What word? Go on and tell the director I'm here, he's waiting for me. Yes, I know he's waiting for you. Excuse me? What's with that ironic tone? Whenever I see a girl like that, and there are loads here, with the perm, the painted fingernails, it makes me nauseous. - She's cute, though. - Yeah, cute... I'll give you some advice, because you seem like the type who likes his women. If you're working here and don't want trouble, keep away from the women... - Mr. Zecchi, you may go in. - Well, that was quick. Excuse me? - Excuse me? - No, just Mr. Zecchi. Why? And who's going to vouch for him now? Poor kid, he's a friend of mine. Just wait a moment, they'll call you soon. Okay, I see. - Good morning, Mr. Bertini. - Morning. - Morning, Mr. Bertini. - Good morn... What are you doing here? Have they called you already? - No, but they'll call me soon. - Ah, I see. Considering the results in the medical report, we thought that perhaps it would be right... - Good morning. - Morning, Bertini. Director... Anyway, for the damages we have decided on a figure of 6,000 liras. Sir, it was a very serious collision. Ask the director here. I have lesions that won't heal for 15 days, and that's without complications. - There haven't been any complications. - Yes, but when it rains... well, Sir, the leg doesn't work properly. - You're in pain, then? - Very much, Mr. Director, S-Sir... And even now, if I make a movement like this... - Laterally? - Yes, laterally, Sir. Laterally. See, at home my wife doesn't even want to believe me. She says that I'm exaggerating, but they're very sharp pains, especially in the arm. - Violent pains... - Close to the bone? Close to the bone, even inside it. They're pains, Sir, that I've never... Okay, okay, let's not get off topic, Mr. Zecchi. Don't forget that as well as the 6,000 liras we're offering you an important, stable position in our department store. Of course. But the two of us are already in agreement, isn't that right, boy? - Show him where to sign. - Very well, this way. Sir, if I may, there is also that warden outside who I reported. Show him in. Mr. Director, gentlemen, I'm ready to give you my word that this young man... I feel the need to mention once again your problems when it comes to understanding the duties required of you as a warden. What? Why were you drinking on duty? That's something I cannot tolerate. It was just a drop, I was alone at night in the cold, it's not that serious. Serious enough for me to suggest that you should be fired. Me, fired? Mr. Director, as you know I've been working in this store for 20 years, and I drank just once... - Not just once. Are you implying that I'm an alcoholic, that I drink? - Ask anyone... - I can vouch for him, he's a good man. Very well, I'll be lenient. Just a small fine, Bertini. - Make it the last time, Gaetano. - Thank you, Director. - The last time. - He already told me. Thanks again. A fine of 50 liras, then. Come with me to the accounts department. 50 liras? 25 liras for every liter. What was it, champagne? - Don't worry, I'll pay it. - Thanks, you're a real friend. - Come on. - I'm coming. - I'll see you at the café downstairs. - See you at the café. Seventh floor! Sixth floor! - It's nothing, please stay calm! - Excuse me. Close the door to the fourth floor! That door always opens, a spring must be stuck. I'm sorry, every time it stops like that, I expect it to fall all the way to the bottom. - Fifth floor! - Bye. My wallet! Someone's stolen my wallet with 6,000 liras! - Fourth floor! - No way! Nobody is getting out until I get my wallet back. - Who stole it? - I don't know. I must get out... - No, Ma'am, nobody is getting out. - I have to get out. - Everyone stop. Go to the ground floor. - And the other people? Go to the ground floor, there will be a manager down there. - How rude! - He's a bully. Yes, a bully, a bully! It's 6,000 liras... - Why are you looking at me? - Why? Because someone stole my wallet. - And you think it was me? - Yes. Exactly, it was you. - Excuse me. - Where are you going? - We've arrived. - And you're getting out? - Nobody is to get out. - I have to go! - I have to get back to my department! - Security! They're shouting, I don't know. They're closed in the elevator. - Are you a security officer? - Yes. - Stop, don't let them out! - Please, Ma'am. What are you doing?! No, stop there. What an imbecile, he thinks that I stole his wallet. Calm down, gentlemen. Let's not turn this into a scandal. - We must be certain. - I just got 6,000 liras and I had it here. And she fell on top of me, pretending that she lost her balance. - How dare you! - How dare I? Yes, it's 6,000 liras! Not just... not just... - Here it is. - Idiot! No, I... no, I put it... I thought that I put it... We must be certain of such things, Sir, before accusing someone. Yes, you're right. - Has the gentleman been served? - Yes, thank you. Very good, and this? - Please, Miss, take it to the till. - Thank you. Miss Corelli, this evening you're on overtime, we have to take stock of all the winter items. - Thank you, Mr. Bertini. And Emilia? - Yes, Miss Emilia too. You should know I'm very grateful for your help. - What would the lady like? - A scarf. - A scarf for the lady. - White, colored, striped, checked...? - Good morning, Mr. Bertini. - Good morning. You're wasting time with those sporting items. - Why's that? - There's nothing to do over there. It's so cold! If we get to do 5 more shifts of overtime, do you know what I'll do? - I'll buy myself a nice thick overcoat. - A thick one? If I were you, I'd just sell that one your husband left behind and instead buy a nice suit. - Maurizio's coat? What if he comes back to get it? It's cold now, he might need it. Be careful! I see, you're still in love with him, aren't you? - Good evening, ladies. - Good evening, Mr. Bertini. What a coincidence, I had meant to speak with Miss Emilia. With me? - You're going home, yes? - Yes. Then perhaps you can take advantage of my automobile, so we can speak easily. But... really, we... To see you in the office, I wouldn't imagine that you had an automobile. Miss Lauretta, outside the office I'm an entirely different man. And then, a small car after so many years of work... some savings. - Well? - Well... thank you. Please, get in. You can sit in the front, Miss Lauretta. Please excuse me, Miss Emilia, I'm sure you already know what this is about. - About Maurizio. - Exactly. I'm sorry to have to speak of such things, but the management has come to know of your separation and I just wanted to ask you, just to clarify things. Oh, it's a simple story. After a year of marriage, we've separated. - Ah, another woman? - Yes, that too. That, and we had a row 15 days ago. Anyway, that's how it is, we didn't get on. I understand. I don't mean to condemn, but... There is also reputation to think about. You two for example. - Us two? - Yes. You are young, pretty... and live alone, that way you're exposed to dangers... Listen, Emilia has been left alone, and I'm on my own as well... We're friends, so I plan to move in with her. - Isn't that so, Emilia? - Of course, darling. Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. I'm here to help you, Miss Emilia. If you want me to put in a good word with the management, I'll do everything I can. But I'd like to speak to you further, so I'd need to see you more often. After work, perhaps we can go out and have some honest fun, so we can get to know each other better. - Yes, certainly. This evening, for example. If you like, maybe I could accompany you to the cinema? No, thanks, it's too late. And we still need to eat dinner. Well, then... we can go out for dinner, to some nice quite place. - No, Mr. Bertini. - Why? Listen, Mr. Bertini, please just take us home. Very well. As you wish, then. - So what happened? - The manager started screaming. - Ida's here! - Congratulations. Congratulations! - Thank you. - Did you get my handbag? I sent it to your house so that I didn't have to carry it around. - Did you get my present? - Yes. Ida, we wanted to get you something useful. - Marta, Lauretta and me. - Ah, thank you. It's new, you know, an electric machine to make coffee. Here are the instructions. Yes, here you go. Listen to this. It says that with the same mix you can make coffee five times. Yes, and after the fifth you can make jam. - How funny! - Don't listen to her! Congratulations, Ida. Congratulations, darling. Here's my present. Well, what are you laughing at? It's not as useful, but it's artistic. - It cost 600 liras. - Just what a bride needs. Darling, there's much more to life than just coffee mix. Oh, of course, of course. And it can get boring to keep certain things in your house for too long. What do you mean by that? That I had it in my house? Of course, it's an antique. - Yes, it must be from your ancestors. - Stupid girl. - Ancestors who were Commendatori. - What did you say? Ah! Maurizio! Shh! Did you see? Your husband is here. - Is Ida here? - Yes. I'm going to the store floor. Out you go, it's forbidden for men to come in here. Well, are you going or not? Us painters aren't interested in seeing girls in their underwear. - You would pay. - No. Ida, I brought you a present as well. Look. Do you like it? That's nice, thank you. Very nice. Well done. - It looks real. - But the sea isn't yellow. - Why don't you dip a toe in? - Let me see. - Art isn't supposed to copy the real. - If you say so... Ida, congratulations. Hey, it's just a kiss! It's ugly. I liked you more when you were doing the mannequins. And I never liked you at all. Here, take it. If you only knew how much I envy you! Not because you're getting married, but because you're leaving this place. I wish! I think I'll have to carry on. - Ida, where should I put this? - Thanks, Lauretta, here. He doesn't want me to, but since there is so much to pay for... When I get married I want to live like a lady. Stay here for 8 hours and then run home to fry eggs for my husband? I'd go crazy. You'd be willing to make eggs from morning to evening, to get married! - And you won't? - I won't. And what about that van driver who comes to the counter just to talk to you? - I've never spoken to him. - She wouldn't waste her time on drivers. - Exactly! - Leave her alone. No! She's the kind of girl who aims higher. Anyway, she's already found someone to do overtime in the evening with. We must go. Is there anyone around? No, the security officer has been past already. - Thank you. - Thanks. Here he is! - How do I look, Miss? - Very good, Sir. Excuse me. - Here you go, Sir. - No, I'll wear it now. This way to the till, then. - Miss... - Good morning. Miss Lauretta, does my insistence not move you? Be careful, don't let them find you here. No, I'm very organized, I have a box and everything. I have to take items to the seventh floor, urgently... I'm just pretending. - Where is the knitwear? - At the end of the third floor, Ma'am. I use the kids working here as a kind of information service. It costs me a few cigarettes a day... If you do all that just to come here, you'd better smoke them. - Why? A love as big as this is always worthy of small sacrifices. Where did you read that? On the back of a cereal box? Yes, and I read the answer as well. Though I want you to tell me it. It said... - What did it say? - Be quiet, you, mind your own business! Don't you believe me when I say I'm in love with you? You really dislike me, don't you? Yes! The Staff Manager is on his way. Yes, Miss, I'll be by tomorrow to see if there's any news. Excuse me. What are you doing here? The seventh floor sent me to take this package... downstairs, urgently. - They sent you? - Yes, Sir. Very well, go on. REDUCTIONS 50/100 - Can I help you? - Thanks, I can't find what I wanted. Did you hear that? After making all that fuss! "Thanks, I can't find what I wanted." Ah, finally! I'm sorry, we don't have it in other colors. Okay, never mind. - A woolen hat, please. - Excuse me, excuse me. - I'm sorry, the store is closing now. - It's just a woolen hat! I've been waiting for half an hour! - Do you have much more to do? - It's been hard work today, darling. - Why, are you in a hurry? - Me? Me, no. I thought so. Even if we're five minutes late, he'll wait for you all the same. - Don't be silly. - Ah, silly? Come on, girls, let's hurry it up. Hurry it up. Hurry up, girls. I was there. A box fell over and all the stuff went on the floor. So I rushed over to help her pick it up: "Miss, allow me..." No reaction at all! Can you believe it! I'm tired of her games! - What did you want her to do? - At least thank me for helping out. The worst thing is that even when she's being mean, I... I'm in love with her. You're the kind that likes to be walked all over. What does that matter? I was determined to get her, but I was wrong. I don't get it, with all the beautiful girls working here, you set your sights on the one that you can't have. That girl belongs... Good evening, Miss. Just a moment. Good evening, Gaetano. - Good evening. - Good evening. Oh, I love that one! And she likes me, you know? - Evening, Gaetano. - Evening. She's the kind that's worth it, a real woman, not one of these simpering girls, without substance, without... body. Stop! Stop! - What's going on? - Can you not see where you're going? Be careful! Look where you're going when you reverse! - It's your fault! - It's not my fault! What are you trying to do? Get out of here! - Gentlemen, please, go. - Boss, it's not my fault. The driver reversed without looking where he was going. The axle is bent. So I'll do these deliveries and then take it to the garage. With a bent axle? Don't be silly. No, the car needs to be repaired. Whose is this van here? - Mine. - Unload and load it all on the other one. - Boss, I can do it. - I said no. Call the garage to tell them the car is coming in for repairs. - Very well. - Unload and load. Quickly. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Off you go, back inside. - I have to do the whole thing? - Of course! - No! - Yes. Quickly, come with me. I've been telling him "no" for 15 days now. - How can I possibly say "yes"? - Ah, so you're a proud one. When he waves to you, instead of turning your back on him as you always do, just give him a little smile. - And then? - Well, he'll come closer. And then what do I do? If you get that far, things will work themselves out. - Is he there? - No. Strange, he'll be around here somewhere. Will you give me a lift? - Did you see that? - Why should I care? Shall we go? Were you waiting for Lauretta? - Why do you say that? - I know everything and see everything. For example, I saw that while we were getting in the car, Lauretta was watching. - No! - Yes. What's with the scared face? You should be thanking me. Because now she'll be jealous of me. - She doesn't seem like the type. - Her? Listen, I know that sly one. She's the kind that would fall in love with you, just to get back at me. So I guess I should fall in love with you just to get back at her. And to please me, no? This is my place. Can I offer you a drink, just to say thanks? No, tonight I have a long trip ahead of me. Come on, let's go! Okay. - Just one drink, then I'll let you go. - Thank you. Come in, come in. Well, what are you doing in here? I told you not to turn the radio on if I wasn't here. Now get out of here. And put your apron on. - Make yourself at home. - Thank you. Here's the drink. - Help yourself. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Okay. I can only stay for a moment because I have to... Why? Are you afraid of me? No, of course not, I... I'll be right back. I must be on my way. Here I am. Ah, so tired. You have no idea! After 8 hours of work on my feet... My ankles are hurting! What are you doing over there? Come here. Here. Next to me. - Did you have a drink? - Yes, thank you. - Do you want another? - I can't, I have make those deliveries. 5 minutes more, 5 minutes less... If I leave now, I still have an hour, an hour and a half to go. "If I leave now..." So you really want to leave, then? I see. But perhaps, after I've delivered all the packages, I could come back... Ah, and what would we do? Who's that? The Commendatore's here. Damn, it's my friend. Be quiet. Gino, go on through. There's a store clerk here, I'll be there in a minute. Okay, darling, okay. - Now you'll have to leave. - Yes, I'm going. No, wait! Wait for him to go in there. - Quietly, okay? - Yes. - Is my sister here? - The Commendatore's here. I know. I have to speak to Anna. - Now? - Yes, now! Come on... Here he is, leave it to me. Bruno! Did you find any packages with wrong addresses? Yes, I spent 2 hours looking for them. 16 Bis Cavour Street doesn't exist. 604 Manzoni Street, it ends at 510! It was an error, a mix up with the address books. Where are the packages? I hope you won't tell the boss about this. You'd get this poor guy into trouble. If we don't help each other... Tomorrow give me the address books and I'll take care of it. - Thanks. And thank you, too. You're welcome. If we don't help each other... - Good night. - Good night, Bruno. - When did you do this? - Last night. - Beautiful! - Does it look like him? - Oh God, it's a bit uglier. - Yes, it's a caricature. - Look at the eyes! - The smile. - It's so funny! - Oh, here's Lauretta. Good morning. What's going on? - You really think it looks like him? - Yes, a lot! I don't know, they're saying it looks like that van driver. - Didn't you do it on purpose? - I don't think so. Yes, the eyes kind of do, the mouth, also the line of the chin, a little. Now you'll always have him close by. Yes, it looks a lot like him. Though you should take it to Anna's department. Why Anna's department? That guy's been chasing me for 15 days and I never once was interested. - If you want, you can have him. - He's not the type for me, darling. If that's the case, you should choose more carefully. Darling, I think you'll find that he was the one who did the choosing. - Everyone has their own methods. - What do you mean by that? That for you it's not difficult to add to your huge collection. - You cheeky little... - Look out, Bertini's here. You'll pay for this. - Good morning, Mr. Bertini. - Good morning, Mr. Bertini. - Morning, Mr. Bertini. - I'll see you tonight then, Miss Corelli. No, thank you, Mr. Bertini. Today I... I don't feel very well. I'm sorry to hear that, but there won't be much to do. Besides, tomorrow is Sunday. If it's too late for you, I can always drive you home. - Thanks, but perhaps another time. - As you wish. Though remember, there's always the chance of a promotion. Thank you, Mr. Bertini. Put that box back. Hey, psst! Young man! - Good morning. - Morning, how's it going? Last night I wanted to come back, but there were some packages with the wrong addresses, it took me 2 hours. - I'm sorry about that. - Me too. - Is that Commendatore always there? - Why? What's it to you? - What are you doing tonight? - I'm going dancing with some friends. - And after midnight, I'm going skiing. - You're going skiing after midnight? - Yes, on the Snow Express. - Ah, I see. - Do you want to come too? - To dance? - No, to ski. - Ah, I... - Actually, I don't... - Do you have a ski suit? No. We have one here that's perfect for you. - What, here? - Yes, come on. Lauretta, there's a gentleman here who would like a skiing suit. - Good morning. - Very well. - We have jackets, long trousers... - I... I think this one will do just fine. Come and have a look. What do you think? But this is me! What are you playing at? - How much does this cost? - 290. Ah, it's not too expensive. Lauretta, please, show the gentleman how the zip works. Thank you. Where is your heart, on the right or the left? So, we're taking this one, right? - I'll need a pair of skis, too, won't I? - Of course, you'll find them downstairs. You'll see how enchanting the Grand Hotel is. When I get there, I always send my friends out to ski first. I like to stay inside, alone, in the warmth. Give me a hat. - You'll keep me company, won't you? - This way to the till! Just a moment! So tonight I'll meet you at the station at around midnight. - Okay, yes. - Please, this way. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - 320. - What, wasn't it 290? And the hat? Emilia! Thanks, darling. It's for the gentleman. Stop that, get back to your counter. - Stop that, you witch! - I'm a witch?! - You are! - Just try it... I'll show you... - Leave me alone. - My hair... let go of my hair! - Stop that, get back to your counter. - Stupid girl. Lauretta, what happened? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Can I help you, Ma'am? Yes, sure. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - I'd like a pair of socks. - Yes, Sir. - Excuse me, where's the bar? - On the first floor. Mr. Bertini? I'm feeling a bit better. If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to stay and do overtime. Very good, and... and thank you. - Good evening, Mr. Bertini. - Good evening. - How are we doing? - It'll take another hour or so. - Where's Miss Corelli? - She left, she didn't feel very well. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Bertini. Another coffee, please. - When does the Snow Express leave? - There's one every hour. - Hey, careful! - What are you doing? Sorry, sorry... Your coffee. Are you not going skiing anymore, Miss? No, we danced all night and we're tired. Oh, that poor guy is already waiting at the station! Mr... Mr... Zecchi. Try and reach him, go on. - Where? - At the café in the station. - How will I find him there?! - You can try! - But... - Stop making a fuss! Call him. Café at the station, café at the station... When I've found the café at the station, if I find it... Ines! Ines! Here I am! Sorry, so sorry... - Shall we have a coffee? - Yes. No, no. Just a moment. How rude! Rude people... Look at that guy! - What is it, a scratch? - Yes, how unfortunate... Put some skin cream on it, perhaps that will help! Snow Express, Number 2. Platform 4. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Are you going skiing, too? - Yes. - You don't have any skis? - No. Lucky you. I've no idea how to carry them. May I? Do you mind if I sit here? - No. - If you're waiting for someone... Me? Me, no. It's cold, isn't it? Don't you think? Can I get you something to drink? A cognac? - Okay... - Waiter! - Waiter! Two cognacs. - Right away, Sir. See? I guessed a few things about you. - Now I'm going to guess another. - Yes? You've never been skiing before. It's true. - How did you know that? - You left the price tag on. - We should take it off... - No, don't take it off! Why? Because... I collect all the tags from the things I buy. It brings me luck. That's an interesting idea for a collection. Every tag is a memento... From now on, every time that you look at that tag, you'll remember this café and this meeting. Snow Express, Number 3. Platform 12. What are those two up to? We have to close up, it's late. I'll tell them. Excuse me, Sir, the last train is about to leave. Ah, yes. Thank you. - Is it the Snow Express? - Yes. How much do I owe you? 9.50. - Keep the change. - Thank you. If you want to ski... the train is leaving. Shall we go? And... Anna? The train is leaving... if we're going, we won't make it. - Sir? - Yes? - Your skis? - Thanks. Excuse me... - Sorry about that, sorry... - Be careful with those! Those two are skiing champions, I'm telling you! Cushions. Two, two cushions... I got two cushions. Here you are. You'll be more comfortable. Thanks. - We're moving. - Yes, we're moving. Put your head here. END OF PART ONE PART TWO - Who's there? - Emilia, it's me. Lauretta, where have you been? - Sorry if I woke you up. - Where were you, Lauretta? Oh, Emilia. Darling Emilia... Don't be mad at me, I'm so very happy. - I've been away with Bruno. - With Bruno? Yes. We spent all of Sunday together. It rained the entire time, it was so quiet. And it was so very cold in that hotel! We were alone all day. - You know, we're going to get married. - Married? Yes, Emilia, yes! Wait, I'll tell you everything. Would you mind telling me what happened? Disappearing like that without telling me, leaving me to worry. - Since Saturday night... - Emilia, don't be mad at me. But... you bought a ski suit as well? No, I didn't buy it. - You didn't buy it? - No... Actually, you have to help me sneak it back into the store. - What, you took it from there? - Yes, but... Are you crazy?! I'm actually worried because the sleeve got torn... But we'll stitch it up and put it back where it was. - No one will ever notice. - But what if they do? No, no, Emilia, no. I'm sure everything will be fine. But Lauretta, don't you realize what you've done? Don't be mad at me, Emilia, don't be mad at me... He's a good guy, Bruno, you know? Nice, but also serious. - You should be nice to him. - Yes, but... - Emilia, I'm so happy today. - Lauretta, you're crazy... Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of having an armchair like this. We had one at home, but that was my father's place. He told me that I would need to get married in order to have one. So you don't want a wife, but an armchair. Of course not! No, this is comfortable. I'd like to have one. So, how much would the entire room cost? 2,500 with the bookcase and the record library. But the bookcase and the record library are optional. - There's a difference of 500 liras. - With the armchairs? No, the armchairs are separate. 600 liras. Sorry, you know, when you're getting married... - We were just looking at it... - Don't worry. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bruno, we've been looking at the figures all week, it's just not possible. We have to learn to be happy with the bedroom and the kitchen. - We'll buy things for a living room later. - This is nice. 150 liras. - This would go well with the furniture. - Come on, Bruno! I meant later, when we buy it. But we haven't even bought plates and saucepans yet! These are much more important, don't you think? Good morning, Mrs. Baldi. I haven't changed yet, but I have permission. - We're getting married, you see... - Yes, yes, I know. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You know, when Ida got married, Mrs. Baldi bought her a magnificent suitcase of imitation leather, she's very kind. Fingers crossed. - The Staff Manager... - Good morning, Mr. Bertini. - I haven't changed, but I have permission. - We're getting married, you see... - I know... congratulations. - Thank you. But now it's late. Go and change, then report to your department. - You, go and report for duty. - Right away, Mr. Bertini. - I'll see you at midday by the entrance. - Okay. Bye, Bruno. Bye. - Mr. Bertini? - What is it? - Management wants to see you. - Very well. Directly from the counters? Yes, then the delivery boys take them down. - Emilia... - Just a moment, darling. - And do you deal with the bills? - No, we only do the receipts. The bills are made out on the ground floor. And are the delivery boys always the same? Yes, I think so. They take it in turns. Very well, thank you. Good day. What's going on? They found a parcel with a false bill and false address. - They're conducting an investigation. - An investigation? Don't you see? Your skiing suit... They're checking everything. We must get it back from the seamstress today. - We must put it back as soon as we can. - Yes, Emilia. Don't worry about that now. - Go and get dressed. - Yes. Did you hear about the investigation? They're conducting a search. A search? Look how scared you are! As if you were the thief. What? An investigation? My petticoat has come unstitched! Who cares? I hope they search us, nothing ever happens in this place. - Good morning. - Morning, Gaetano. I don't understand why I can't drive you there. You don't know my aunt. If she sees me with a man, she won't believe you're with Lauretta. - She's a real character! - Yeah. Then I'll come and pick you up at your house at half-past two. No, Bruno, don't you see? We're going to her aunt's for breakfast. - She has invited us. - That way she'll drive us back here. I'll see you this evening, Bruno. Goodbye, see you tonight. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Bruno. - I'm not convinced. - Why? - All lies. - What? I once knew a woman who appeared to have 7 cousins and 14 aunts. And sometimes she seemed to care more about her relatives than about me. - She was so much trouble! - Gaetano, don't start... - Are you coming to eat? - Nobody leaves, there's the investigation. - So the stories are true? - Of course they are! They've been checking and questioning everyone since this morning, it's awful. Did I ever tell you about those parcels I found in the van? - Those had wrong addresses as well. - Yes, that's true! You know all this but you've not told management about it?! - Good morning, Gaetano. - Good morning, Miss Lucia. Oh, I love that one! Do you think I should go and speak to management? Of course, as soon as Mr. Bertini is here you should go to his office. In these situations if you stay quiet, you always end up in more trouble. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Your belt. - Rina? - Ma'am! - Isn't Miss Corelli here? - I saw her before in the changing room. - It's already 3:10, go and look for her. - Yes, Ma'am. Mr. Berti, Pietro Pavese, and Remo the delivery boy. - Remo, did you say? - Remo, yes. Remo. Listen, boy, I appreciate your eagerness and honesty, but despite your report, I was already aware of this, anyway it seems that we're just dealing with an error. But, with regard to this story, there is now a new and painful fact that concerns you, as well. - Me? - Yes. Miss Corelli. She just attempted to put back this ski suit, that she stole. What? What do you mean, stole? Yes, unfortunately. She says that she did it in order to come with you on a trip and tried to justify her actions with... well, romantic reasons. It's true... she came away with me and wore that suit, but... - She must have just borrowed it... - Yes, yes... a prank, an inconsiderate mistake. All the girls that have been discovered stealing, and I've seen a few in my career, they always justify their actions in the same way: there's need, there's vanity, there's love... But you told me that she was putting it back. After a week, and not until she came to know of the investigation. And that's not all we're dealing with. - Listen... - What is it? Excuse me. I wanted to ask you something, but... I'll come back later. Thank you, Miss. These boxes of stockings were found... in Miss Corelli's locker. - No! High quality stockings, something like... 500 liras worth of goods. That's impossible. The suit, perhaps... but this, no... - I don't want to accuse her... - What did she say? I didn't want to interrogate her any further on the subject. It could be that someone had hidden the stockings in her locker to cover their own tracks... But he or she who steals once... Did you know that in order to steal that suit she gained entry to the store at night, eluded the vigilance of the watchmen at the risk of being shot by them. You need some kind of imagination to do such things. Where is she now? She felt ill. You know, when they're found out... I sent her home. - Fired? - No. We need to proceed to an inquiry, first, to move rashly now may harm the chance of a successful investigation. I'm sorry for you, boy. Oh, and nobody else outside us two and the person who discovered the theft is aware of this. And I trust that person. Therefore don't speak a word to anyone about that which you reported to me and about that which I've been forced to tell you. If it's necessary, I may call on you for a testimony. Is that clear? Go on, boy. Good evening, Bruno. Good evening. - You're not on duty tonight? - I'm on leave. Where's Lauretta? She's on the bed, she didn't feel very well. - Lauretta, Bruno's here. - Good evening. Good evening. Aren't you going to kiss me? - You know, don't you? - Yes. I spoke to Bertini. Bruno, Bertini probably told you how it happened. I wanted to see you that evening. I didn't want you to leave with Anna, so I took the suit. Yes, I did a bad thing, a terrible thing, but then I took it back. I didn't think it was such a terrible thing. I know. A prank, an inconsiderate mistake. You did it for me, but you didn't tell me anything. That's true, I didn't tell you anything, but I told Emilia. - Yes, it's true, Bruno. - Yes, Emilia. Bruno, don't you believe me? Why do you think I did it? You know that I did it for you. It's something that you, of all people, shouldn't be berating me for. I've seen... they showed me that pack of stockings as well. - Stockings? - What are you talking about? - Did you do that for me, too? - I don't know what you mean. Oh, you don't know anything? They found them in your locker. - In my locker? - They found you out. Don't you know? They found you out today, just after you left. And you should thank Bertini, that only I know about it. Bruno, are you crazy? What are you talking about? Lauretta is under investigation for theft. - You can't believe that! - How can you possibly accuse Lauretta? The only thing she ever did wrong was to fall in love with you. Yes... you're just covering for each other. And I'm supposed to believe you? You, who this morning made up that story about your aunt so I wouldn't take you, and instead there was the stolen suit to put back! But I didn't steal. Trust me, I didn't take those stockings. I'm not a thief, I'm not a thief! Look at me... Look at me! Get off. Then get out, get out! Don't torment me any further, I don't ever want to see you again. Get out! Go away! Lauretta... Bruno? Go away, go away... - Oh, Emilia! - Lauretta... Well, it looks like you're keeping yourselves busy... - Get downstairs, they're looking for you. - Yes, Ma'am. You, go to the packing department and help Emilia, she's not feeling well. Okay. - Emilia, how are you? - Better, I drank a glass of water. - My head is still spinning. - Who stole my pencil? - No, here it is. - Nobody ever steals around here. You never know. How can I help you, Ma'am? They're talking about me, you know. Lauretta, it's all in your mind. They don't know a thing, don't worry. Miss, Mr. Bertini wants to see you in his office. Very well. Come in. - You called for me, Mr. Bertini? - Yes, Miss Corelli. Come in, come in. Please, make yourself comfortable. - Come on, sit down, don't be afraid. - Thank you, Mr. Bertini. The investigation has been closed and there was no further need to speak... about that skiing suit. The truth has remained between you and I. Yes, but those packs of stockings... Did they find out who did it? For now, no, though perhaps soon... They can still think that I did it? Excuse me. Hello? - Who? - It's me, Berti. Ah, Berti. Right now? No... No... Listen, this evening the store will be open for the decorating. Exactly, you and Pietro can do it. Yes, I'll be there as well. Yes. Yes, of course. Okay. Come on, don't be so sad. Miss Lauretta... you know exactly what I think about you. Yes, you... but everyone else? I see. Your boyfriend. A man who has behaved as he has towards you... is no great loss. He wasn't just a boyfriend. I see... And he left you? Miss, come on, there's no need to lose heart. A young girl, pretty, intelligent like yourself... Remember that you have a friend in me. I'm an important person in this place. Excuse me for asking, but if you're having financial difficulties... - No, thank you. - I can help you. I have money to spare. I am a serious man, not a boy. It would be nice... It would be nice to see you sometimes. Alone, without people bothering us. - But, Mr. Bertini, I... - No, not "Mr. Bertini". You don't have to call me that. Remember that your dismissal papers are still in my desk, so you owe it to me. Because I'm a friend, I told you. More than a friend. If you want, I'm here to help you, either here at work or outside. Thank you, Mr. Bertini. So, are we clear? I'll come and pick you up one of these nights. If possible, this very evening. - Okay? - Okay, Mr. Bertini. - Have you seen Emilia? - Yes, she almost fainted, poor thing. - Really? - They took her to the changing room. Thanks. Nothing serious, all you need now is some rest. - How do you feel now? - Much better, thank you. - The taxi is here, Ma'am. - Thank you. - Emilia! What happened? - Nothing, darling. She just had a little shock, why don't you take her home in the taxi? Goodbye, darling. You, back to your places, off you go! - What happened? - Nothing, nothing... Emilia wasn't feeling well, she's expecting a child. Take this. And this, too. It'll look good in tails. You're taking away Lauretta's mannequin without asking her? - That's my business. - When she finds out, she won't be happy. If you're not quiet, I'll put you in the Halloween display. - Idiot. - Yeah, "idiot"... - Do you want to iron anything? - No, thanks. You don't want to take it in? Yes, but what does it matter? Who's going to look at it? Give it to me. I'll tighten the waist and redo the hem, it won't take very long. Cheer up, Lauretta. - I'll end up like Anna, you know. - No, you're not the type. Just like I'm not the type. We're not capable even of that. Poor Emilia... All our reasoning still doesn't stop us from being two wretched souls. Who's calling at this hour? Do you think it's Bertini? I don't think so, I'll go and have a look. Hold on, I'm going through here. Emilia, if it's Bertini, think up some excuse. Send him away tonight. Emilia... - Emilia, forgive me. - Oh, Maurizio! - Don't cry, forgive me. - Maurizio... I made you suffer, didn't I? Me too, you know... - Emilia! - Maurizio! - I can't breathe! - Did I hurt you? - No, no. - It's better if you sit down. Here, in the armchair. Come... Sit yourself down, you need to rest. - How do you feel? - Oh, Maurizio, I feel fine. You need to be more careful now, you know? - Good evening, Lauretta. - Good evening. Tell her this as well, she must take more care of herself now. You know what we should call him? Raffaello. - No. - What, don't you like it? It's a nice name, an artistic one. And my son will be a great artist. - And if it's a girl? - Well, if it's a girl... It doesn't matter. A girl? It has to be a boy! It has to be a boy! Maurizio... Lauretta is here. Well, what does that matter? You are my wife. - Aren't you going to take off your coat? - No, I have to get back to work. - You're going? - Yes, but you can come with me, keep me company until I've finished. Then we'll go to my place, pick up the cases and come back here. Okay. Emilia, can I stay here, just for tonight? I don't know, even in the entrance hall... Lauretta, what are you saying? You're staying here. Maurizio will have to adapt for a couple of days, won't you? Of course, for me it's no problem. Tell you what... Why don't we all go to the store together? That way you're distracted. When we get back, we'll sort it out. Okay. Ah, finally! - My friend, I'm hungry! - Sorry... I just managed to buy a few things before they closed. I'm so hungry! What's this? Fruit. What's this? Chicken? - This is a bat, not chicken! - There are two! Good. And the potatoes? They're there. - There's everything, even dessert. - Ah, well done! - What about the wine? - Water! You shouldn't even be mentioning the word "wine" in here. It cost me too much, almost got me fired! And now, after that theft, they also accuse me of being a low performer. Hey! Where are you going? Good evening and enjoy your meal. - Ah, you're here too? - Yes. - Are you the assistant warden? - What are you doing here at this hour? Me? I'm here on the Staff Manager's orders, Mr. Bertini. Bye! - Gosh, I hate that guy! - That guy is here because of his sister. If I had a sister as pretty as his... Mr. Bertini wouldn't be accusing me of being a low performer. There's something going on between Anna and Bertini? So they say. Just a rumor! - Good evening, Gaetano. - Good evening, Maurizio. Good evening, Bruno. Hey, see anything different? Well done! - Good evening, Miss Emilia. - Good evening. - Evening, Miss Lauretta. - Evening... - Well done, Maurizio, so you've made up? - Yes. - I'm happy for you. - I assure you we're happier. Well, let's go. - Did you see how run down she looked? - Who? - Lauretta. - Come on, eat. Food seems so much more dry if you eat without wine... don't you find? - What? - Stop thinking about it! - What if I made a mistake? - Again! Okay, I see... We need to cheer you up. What are you doing? I look after ourselves however we can! - Good evening. - Oh! Miss Emilia, good evening. - Good evening. - We've made up. Good for you, congratulations! - How are you getting on? - They're on the third display. Now I'll sketch out the drafts for the new display windows. Make sure the window dressers are here tomorrow at 7:00. Sure. - Let me see. - Excuse me. That looks fine. - Have you finished? - Yes. Take that over. Careful, otherwise we'll have to start all over again! Good evening! SALES - Good evening. - Good evening. My hat! Where's Lauretta? She must have gone, she must have realized that we wanted to be alone. Lauretta? There's no one here! We're alone, you and I. This is my wife. Bless this happy couple. - Maurizio, don't be childish. - Aren't you happy? Yes. When I found out that you were going to have a child... I somehow felt bigger and stronger. I felt like an important person, almost as if everyone now turned to look at me. Oh, Emilia! - What was that? - It's thieves. Thieves? - Get out of here, Pietro! - Hold on! Get out of here, I say! Hey! Stop! - Pietro, what's going on? - Must be a mistake, I have to go. Just a moment, nobody is leaving here until the alarm has been turned off. I need to leave on Bertini's orders. Move out of the way. - Nobody is leaving. - Move out of the way or I'll get Bertini. - What do you have in that box? - Don't be an idiot, get out of my way! Where's he going? Pietro! Pietro! Pietro, stop! - Did you see that? - Yes. Gaetano, I saw somebody running, did he come out this way? - Yes! - Come with me. - What are you doing? - Let's get to the bottom of this. Stay there, you, don't move! What's all this fuss? Come on, get back to work! You, why did you set off the alarm? - I thought that... - There were thieves. What thieves? Get back to work. - A girl has fainted up here. - A girl? Stop... slow down. - Where are you going? - Why is he running out of town? Let him go, tomorrow we'll report him to the management. No, if they accuse her and she's not guilty, someone will pay. - Why are you looking at me? - Yes, even you put in a good word. I just said, "Watch out for the women, because..." Be quiet! - Slow down! - Be quiet! We'll both be quiet if you crash! Damn, he's really flying! You know what I'm going to do? - No... - Look. - Are you crazy? - Not at all. I've seen it in the American movies. They aim at the tire and... bang! - Don't! - What's the matter, are you afraid? Pull over! Pull over... Stop! Stop! - Stop the car! - No! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, otherwise I'll shoot you in the leg. - Do you know what happened to Lauretta? - Lauretta, the poor thing! Apparently they had to guard her all night. - Guard her? - Yes. And now they've brought her in, to be interrogated by the management. - Miss, please... - Yes, how can I help you? They arrested Lauretta, the night watchman... what's he called? Gaetano, Pietro, Lauretta's boyfriend, Anna. Even Mr. Berti, that's what I heard. I heard that last night they stole two vans worth of stuff. - Really?! - Watch out, Baldi's coming! - What happened? - I'll tell you in a minute. Take the gentlemen to the office, I'll be right there. This way, officer. - Mr. Bertini? - What is it? What are you doing here? Hold on... Do you know what these are? "Paid". And this? "Home delivery". And this? "Especially reserved for the Staff Manager". I don't understand. - And this? And this? - What of it?! I'll have you... What?! Pietro and Anna are at the police station. It took 10 hours to make them talk! But finally they confessed everything! - Get back! - Everybody out of the way! - Get back! - People, stay calm! Put the music on the loudspeakers! Nothing happened, stay calm! Are you crazy? What have you done? - What happened? - Nothing. Bruno! - We were at the third floor... - I'll take you there. You've put two vans and an elevator out of use, but those people were stealing 2-300,000 liras a year. So I must thank you. Thank you. - I'm just sorry about my arm. - Does it hurt? Yes, inside. I see... We'll come to some agreement on this occasion as well. We plan to get married, and the money is never enough. If you buy a dining room, then you can't afford a bedroom. We'll try to help you buy furniture for the whole house. - Thank you and bye. - Congratulations! Bye! - We'll get a living room as well! - I hope so! Gaetano, look at this and tell me it's not the best display you've ever seen. - It's very nice! - I made it! - Let's go, Bruno's cold. - Lauretta, come and have a look! Lauretta, Bruno, come and look. I worked on this for 3 days! It's only small, but it's an idea. For a display window, it's all about the idea and the color. - Good evening, Miss Lucia. - Good evening, Gaetano. Oh, I love that one! THE END
