- Help! Help! - Wait! - Help! Mum! (Whistle) - Get out, wino. Catch a cold. (Message to shout): "Dear visitors," "at 19 o'clock on our dance veranda begins ..." - Hold on, defender. "... The program includes a performance by the rock band CITY" - For dancing? - Yeah. - See you later. (Mansion): And one, two, three, four! (Instrumental music) (In unison): And ... one, two ... (Whistle) Here are those on! - Vatagin, he escaped, or was he taken away? - Gone. - Interesting - what reptile thought of? That would embed! - It will. Freshly hanged. - Exactly. - Oh, ours have come. - Excuse me. - Wow, team leader. - Zhen, hi. - Hi. How are you? - The order. - Good evening. - Great. - Hi. “Again on the bridge.” Look. - I would invite. His eyes were oiled. (Voice from the side): You look, a. (Sergey): What's new? - Accountant. She came from Orel. - White dance. Girls are inviting. Dedicated to the team of Sergey Vatagin. - Sorry Please. - You are welcome. - Allow? - I allow it. - Allow. - I got it. Yes? - Op. On behalf of the foremost. Hi, Valyok. “Are you waiting for me?” - And who else. Come along, defender? - And today I was at a lecture ... "Why do people get divorced." Very interesting, only ... - Why interesting. Wimps, that's getting divorced. I need to get married once and for all, I think. - I think so too. - You? Freak. - And on Saturday, the movie club is good. Let's go to? - Can. - These are my mansions. The mistress is old, and even deaf. Falls asleep - you can’t wake a gun. So I adjusted to the window to climb. - Out the window? (Laughs) Come on, it's so funnier. (Ringing utensils) What are you? Well ... Oops. Wow grant hotel. Ho ... Wow! Wow. How are you him? - Well, how ... Usually. - Do you love me? - Of course. - Truth? “Well, what kind of habit do you all have?” Love - not love. - Seryozha! (Chatting about something fun, laughing) (Boys): Bride and groom, bride and groom, tili-tili dough! - Come, guys, go! Go! - Who is it? (Police siren) - Wait! Wait! Wait, they tell you! What are you doing, huh? What are you doing! Are you blind? A dead end after all! - Dead end ... (Car signal) - A merry wedding. Eh-her! Where are you going? (Sounds music on the dance floor) (Knock on the door) - Live. (Laughter) (Sergey): Uh ... Well, it's cold ... It's good with us, mom. - Good. - Grace. And who is being built? - Kostya Nichaev is back. He taught in the city. Tired of saying. I miss my native places, I have no strength. Wife Valyushka, also a teacher. Two children - Olka da Kolka. Now the collective farm is setting up a new house for them. And ... Michael helps. - Bear? - Well. - Marta, this is my sidekick since childhood. - He’s not a Bear today. And the master technologist Mikhail Ivanovich. Consider 7 years running the industrial farm. The director is far away, in a forest area. - Let's go say hello. Set the table, mom. Take sweets in the suitcase, gifts for you. - Call everyone to visit. On a visit. - Seryoga! What a surprise! - Kostya! - Seryoga! Did not forget? - Nope. - Remember the devil. Drawn, it turns out, to the native penates. Valya, get acquainted. My school friend. - Sergei. - Valya. - And this is my half. - Martha. Very nice. The other day just returned. Such a Komsomol wedding was cut off! - And these are my offspring. Olka and ... Ours, ours. And Kolka. Look at what you learned! Builders! “Why two kennels, guys?” “This is for Jack, and this is for Barsik.” - So as not to quarrel. - They were tortured in the city, in cramped conditions. They even decided to breed dogs in different kennels. - Bear has arrived! - Here are the things. One hundred years stand. - No, a hundred will not stand. - I would understand that. Seryoga. - Himself. Uh ... - Falcons flock to their native nest. Pulls us. AND? Hammer! Are you on vacation? - My half. - Martha. “Well, this time we are going to have such a wedding for you that we never dreamed of in your nasty city.” (Funny ditties) - Yesterday you live, Seryoga. “Why yesterday?” - Yes, because you don’t see your prospects. What do you think - in the city of God grabbed by the beard? So did not grab, Seryozhenka, did not grab. Well, you get your one-room apartment for a young family. So what? Central heating, and a tank with a drain. Correctly? And I, Seryozhenka, have my own heating plant, personal. And I also have a toilet. Come on, look at my house now. Four rooms are eighty square meters. Store room, kitchenette 16 squares. Do you want a cake for the oven, do you want a goat to download. And I’m giving birth to five. Enough space for everyone. “No, that doesn't suit us.” All my life in the pine forest to count ... - In which forest? What kind of pines? Do you need to work hard at a construction site to tear off a Lada? AND? But will they sell it again, Seryozhenka. And in my five-year plan the whole history of technology has passed. Was there a motorcycle? It was. Cossack was also. Moskvich was also the 412th. Well, in about three years I’ll transfer to the Volga. - Exactly. You are quite bourgeois, Bear. - And you shut up, delicate grief. Well, where would you live with your kid if Mishka didn’t help you with materials? Seryoga, come to me as a foreman, I’ll shower you with gold. Decide. - Oh, and gold ... - And you shut up, beauty. Who are you by profession? “Well, accountant.” - Yes, not "well, accountant." The most deficit. If you, Seryoga, remain, I guarantee you 500 a month. - Aren't you lying? - Seryozha, well, when did Shchekunov lie? Come on, Tan, give me the apple. Sour. Well, hostess, treat you. (Sergey sings) - Dexterously. “You won't be lost with me, honey.” Let me go in a circle, except mine. She can't. “Maybe I can't?” They say: to drink from someone else’s wineglass - to expel all thoughts. “Are you so sinful?” But I'm not afraid. Clean Like a tear. - Come on, guys ... for ... people to return ... to their roots. This forest. To this little lake. Maybe there are places more beautiful. Yes, not ours. I’m looking at you ... and it’s a shame that two days later you are the one ... You are needed here. Desired. - Maybe we really will? Desired. (Car signal) - Serge. - M? - Serge. (Shouts from the truck in chorus): Seryoga, Seryoga, Seryoga! - Seryozha, get up. - Nope. (From the truck): Marta, Marta, Marta! - Watch out! - Seryoga, beware! - For food. You need a sweater, or you’ll get a cold. The rest is on the book. - Boots for mom. The old ones were thin. - Nothing, repair - it passes. - Inconveniently. She spares nothing for us. - And we do not regret it. We are saving. Well, okay, I'll buy it in the commission. (Knock on the door) - Come in, open. - Hi guys. - Oh cool! “The matter is with me.” Help out a hundred to a salary. Completely sewn up with this palace. A kind of bottomless barrel. - With pleasure, but, unfortunately, we have all the money on a fixed deposit. - Well, what to do ... Sorry. - Why are you doing this? - Seryozha, we count every penny. And they are Olka doll, then Kolka scooter. - Well, so are the children. - Provide, and then backwaters. I think so. - Count it. And do not break friendship. Clear? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Is everything okay? - It's okay. Thank. - Have a good rest. - Thank. - What is she so affectionate with you? - When a person has his own car, he is friends ... with the traffic police. (Sounds the music that was on the dance floor that evening) - What is the matter with you? - Let's Dance? - Lida ... I have long wanted to tell you ... - Vasya. I know. Only I can’t. - To forget him? - I forgot! Completely forgot. “You're working here.” And your hubby is fooling around. - Like this? - And so it is. Fog him, you see, his eyes closed. Refuses to go to the site. Well, what did I say? - Are you sick or something, Seryozha? In the morning, it seemed, he was healthy. - I'm healthy now. Only you can’t work in the fog. Safety precautions do not allow. And the partner refuses. “Your partner is a loafer known.” - And let me find out, comrade ... - Your milk has not dried out yet, so that you can pump the rights. C'mon, what can you get from the city? But what are you looking at, if not your own? Fog ... I think you can get bonuses. Pennant snapped off, be healthy. When the monthly plan is on fire, of course, ... - That’s not the point, Seryozha. It’s not for this that we cuckoo here to beat the bucks. “Okay, stop itching.” Come on, Vityok. - Nope. I'm afraid my mother will be left without a son. “How is he, doctor?” - The condition is serious. The spine is affected. But let's hope. "Dear son, Seryozhenka." "Today Martha is back from town." “Says - you don’t have any relief yet.” “I wanted to go right after you,” “but she says - no, he’s better there.” “He needs care.” “And I still think - I would leave faster at home.” "Who is better off than mother and wife." - Take heart, honey. It will not be easy. But, by the way, time will tell. Maybe you also have ... children. “What are you, doctor.” What children? - Aah! Oooh ... - Everything will be fine, dear. Everything will be fine. (Sobs) - Go ... Go to him, daughter. Go on. You are a scratch. Be patient. After all, what kind of flour does it take? Have pity on him. (Sergey sings a mournful song) ... over water-oh-oh ... ... oh-oh over-oh-oh ... Oh-oh over water- oh-oh -ra-ti-la-et- Xia .. Groom at the mouth ... Groom at the mouth ... Oh groom at the thief-from-do-yes-yes-ah ... Oh, they brought him ... oh, they brought him ... Oh, they brought him ... chests are full of good ... This is not my-e-e ... Oh, this is not my-oo-e ... Oh, this is not mine, this is my brother-in-law ... They brought him .... Oh, brought e-mu -uh ... oh, brought him-u-Light-Nastatyushka .... This is my-yo ... Oh, this is my-yo ... Oh, this is mine, God-bound ... How long do you think living upstairs? - Serge. So you feel better. So it’s more convenient for you. (Sings again) - Yes, stop whining. And without that it is sickening. - Here I am. Not tired of resting? Well, get up, lounger. The Nechaevs, look, housewarming on the nose. How are we without you? “Not for the holidays, now, Mikhail Ivanovich.” - "Not until the holidays"! Come out for a while, beauty. We have a conversation with Sergei. - No reason. - Wow, what is it like with you. “No need” and cut it off. Well, for me - stay. Moreover, the conversation concerns you. Here is such a thing, Seryozha ... ... it turns out. They want to remove me from work. And, kind of, by your grace. - What is it like? - And so, Seryozhenka, like that! A commission came here with the chief engineer. Remember, he still handed you a pennant? And they gave me a court. Yes, it seems, I have violated safety precautions regarding you. And I have to answer for that. Well, tell me only in conscience, Sergey, in conscience. I drove you that damned day to the cutting area? I didn’t drive, Seryozhenka. I did not drive. He volunteered. I wanted to make money. No, well, maybe, of course, it was necessary to stop, to prevent ... But after all, what’s the matter, Sergey. If I knew where you would fall, I'd spread the straws for you. - What do you want? - And here, Seryozhenka, I have my application here ... ... that is yours. Well, they say, the injury was received through his own fault. And no complaints. Well, you won’t be hurt. You will still receive a disability pension. - Do not subscribe, Seryozha. He beat you up that day. I heard it myself. And our women will confirm. - And you didn’t beat him up? - I am not responsible for safety measures. Don’t listen to him, Sergey. I know the castle looked. Now he must pay you. - Well, and you are a star! He still does not get up anymore, but I live! (Mom): Get out of here. Tatyana is always glad of yours. And you ... forget the road. - Wait, mom. Martha, a pen. - I'm not giving it. - Give me! I have yet animate object! - On, on. - Live! - Seryozha, Nadezhda Ivanovna to us. Hello, Nadezhda Ivanovna. - Good afternoon. Hello. How are you, Sergey Ivanovich? And I ... drove by - I decided ... I decided to stop by to see how your illness is proceeding. - Flowing. - How are you feeling? - Thank you, good. - And the mood? - The best! You can even dance. Oh! - Well, well, let me see you. - You know what? You go ... Now ... for the trouble. - Seryozha. - Doctor. Doctor, forgive us. “I'll stop by another time.” - Doctor. Is there really nothing to be done? - The spinal cord is affected. Of course, let's hope for the best. Ah, here you go. This is so that you do not once again dangle in the city. They are given according to a special recipe with a round seal. Here, please, give for severe pain on the powder. And preferably not more than once a day. In the worst case, no more than two. And God forbid ... - Nadezhda Ivanovna told me to drink ... with severe pain. - A good thing. Heel took in the box. Don’t look at me like that. Just kidding. OK, go ahead. I'm tired. (Funny music) (Knocking of heels on the top floor) (Knocking of heels) (The door slammed) (Buzzer from the ferry) (Signal of the bus) (Shouting in chorus from the bus): Marta! Martha! Martha! - Ma-ma! ... - Son. - Mom, take it away, take it away. Mom, go to the key to get water. - Do you want to drink? “No, the floors in the hut, mom.” You're my. - What are you, son. It's a sin, after all. The key is washed away after the deceased. - You're my. Wash, mom. - Can I invite you? - I do not dance. - Excuse me. (The same song plays as the first time Martha appeared on the dance floor) - Let's talk? - With me? And this is you? Not calm down yet? - Where is Sergey? - Why do you want it? - None of your business. - From what? Wife after all. - Wife? Do you sweep your tail around the dance floors? - And you try ... Try on my place. Do you think this is the Seryoga who the girls snapped like seeds? Crippled he is now. Can you figure it out? - Where is he? - Stupid you. Anyway, you won’t go. And if you go, you will run away. - Who are you going to? - Am I to Sergey? - To Sergey? Where did you come from? “Martha, are you?” - Hello, Seryozha. “Did I call you?” “Why did you let her in, mom?” - There’s nowhere to go for a man, Seryozhenka. He wants to be a driver at the timber industry farm. And with the hostel, you yourself know how. We have a lot of places. Sorry, or what? The car is with her. Maybe bring firewood or something. After all, winter is just around the corner. “I want peace in my house.” - Temporarily she. Well, temporarily. - We do not need guests. I now have little time left. - Seryozha. - Sorry, mom. I lost myself. Lost it. - Skrapis, son. Such people came from the war ... - That's from the war. To suffer for this is a holy thing. And for his stupidity, but for greed ... - What are you and me to do now, son? “I don't know, mom.” I do not know. - And I’m not temporary, Evdokia Semyonovna. I am for good. (Disturbing music sounds) - Well, what do you want? - Leave me half, Serge. I won’t live without you. - Tracked your hand? (Sings): Pa-ram, pa-ram, pa-ram-pa-pam ... - Not hurt? Let's fix it. - We have a man in the house. He will fix it. - And now ... a surprise. This is for you Parsley. And this is the humpbacked horse. He can do anything. “So let him heal you.” “No one will cure me now.” As they say, not God, not a king and not a hero. - And here's what they gave us. - Seryozha, fix the stool. And then I broke her today. - What are you doing? Where did you see a joiner with a broken ridge? - And you try. - So. Sorry. Look, Seryozha, cloudberries have ripened. The car rushes, the mountain ash flickers. And ... there, come on ... lingonberries ripen. (Sings) (Knock on the door) - Open. - Hello. - Hello. - I would Tinyakova Lida. “And she is at work.” - Will be back soon? - And you, excuse me, who will she be? - Yes, you could say that ... ... the groom. - What? - Yes, you do not worry. Maybe it's good that she lingers. I am ... Not so much to her as to you. After all, you left her! After all, while I was healthy, while everything was fine, I was not needed! Of course, with her character, rush to the rescue, like drinking water. But you be a man, be a man - set her free. - I do not hold. - Hold on. Just as you hold. - So what do I need to drive her away? I can not. “Can you break someone else's life ?!” - Listen ... Maybe you're right. Take her away. Just do not demand from me. (The sound of a car approaching) - She. - She ... - Earring, look, what a lingonberry! Vasya. - Let's leave. Well, why are you here? After all, he offended you. Scary, offended for life. - No need to talk about it, Vasya. “Well, why not?” I understand it, of course. Well, people got married. Then suddenly misfortune. Well, such a fate - endure for life. But you, you? What for you? I got an apartment. Waiting for you. Life for you ... ready to give. - So I'm ready, Vasya ... ... for him. “But it's just ... some kind of insanity.” Well, what did he deserve? I do not demand an answer from you. I ... I will do everything you want, everything you need. Just do not destroy yourself. - You need a stroller. - What? What? - Wheelchair. So that he could ride. Lies after all ... weakens. - A stroller? We’ll come up with a stroller. You are the main thing ... ... decide. - What are you, Vasya. Can I now from here. - I'll go put the dough. And then I wanted pies with lingonberries. Oh, my stool is a stool! He was old, but he was just like new. “I have never seen it either!” Wait, I’ll build such a chair for you. - The chair is for mom. And I would have three more stools. So that there were people to plant. (A funny laugh is heard) - Receive guests, Seryozha. - Peace to this house. - Oh, hello, eared. - And you, brother, it seems nothing. You look cheerfully. Wow. I'm on business with you. - In what case? - Valentina somehow brought your figures to her first-graders at a labor lesson . What started here! All grabbers and knives grabbed. Here. I spoke with the director ... Anyway, in short. Will you take them to train? - How to train? - At home, of course, at home. Found a bid. We don’t have a Trudovik. - Oh, Kostya. Thank you, Kostenka. - Well well well. So what? Deal? - Deal. You’ll bring boards. I’ll make benches for the guys. - Got it. - We'll bring a table from the kitchen - they will fit. - Right. I went. “So, guys.” Today we will cut Mikhail Ivanitch Toptygin. Take those pencils. But first think about what kind of bear you will have. Angry or kind. Or maybe he has a sweet tooth for you? Wanted honey? Ah guys? - Who is honey, and who is pies. - Hurray! - Quietly, very quietly. Enough for everyone. - To me! -I'm the first! - To me! “Are you breaking the lesson again?” Well, everything is in place. - What do you have pies with? - I have it with meat. - And I have with cottage cheese. (The guys make a fuss) And today in Russian I got "2" ... - Vasya. - I brought him a chair. And a doctor ... for a briefing. Meet Nadezhda Ivanovna. This is Lida. - Lida? - Please pass. - you? - There you go ... and a stroller. Turned the whole warehouse until he chose. Here. - Vasya. Thank you, Vasenka. Thank the doctor. Without it, I wouldn’t be able to break through anything. - Listen ... This is ... an interesting case. Excuse me ... what's your name? - Evdokia Semenovna. - Evdokia Semyonovna, tell me, please. How many hours a day did he do gymnastics? And which? What gymnastics? - Yes, he worked, Nadezhda Ivanovna. He knocked, glued, cut into wood. First, with difficulty, and then he hunted, we could not even tear it. - And all through her, through Lida. If it weren’t for her, he might not have been in the world. - Mum. - What mom? They say the truth: There would be no happiness, but misfortune helped. “I brought you a chair there.” You can ride ... and in general ... - Thank you. - I don’t need your “thank you”. I tried for her sake. Remember - you will offend ... I will get it from the other world. - Well, then you and the police. How to dignify you according to the priest? - Mikhalych. - It’s a pity, Vasily Mikhalych ... our paths diverge. I would like to have a friend like that. - Happily. - Thank. “You have gold hands, Sergey Ivanovich.” Saved, you can say, the exhibit. Lucky our museum. I brought you the money. Sign, please. And here is a gift. Not for service, but for the soul. Album of wooden sculpture. - Thank. But ... dear, he is. “Uh, don't worry about that.” My spouse has a saying: Skill is not cheaper than money. - A wise proverb. - Well, it's so popular. - Anton Petrovich. - I'm hearing you. - How long have you been married? - 38, not far off and gold. - Do you have a good wife? “There are no bad wives, Sergei Ivanovich, in my mind, nor bad husbands.” If that is not okay in the family - the demand from both. Why do you need it? As far as I can tell, Lidia Grigoryevna is a beautiful woman. Forgive me, old man. Do not get jealous. I like her. - Me too. - The roller. Valya. How do you? - All the way. And you? - I went on vacation to my mother. - Well, how is it ... mother? - Nothing. Calling home. How is Serge? - Normal. Started to work. - To work? Can not be. Valya ... What do you think? If I ... - And it's you ... think it yourself. (Music that was on the dance floor) (Funny laughter) (Lida): So! Sea bathing. - Lida, what are you? Lida, what are you? Lida? Didn't you get sick for an hour? I said - mushrooms are bitter. “There is nothing to do with mushrooms, Seryozha.” There’s something else ... We’ll have a little one. - Yes! (Song): Love and quarrels will not wash away love . Love will not be washed away ...
