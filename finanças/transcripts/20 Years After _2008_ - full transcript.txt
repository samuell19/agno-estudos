It is not enough to know that the world has ended. For there is more to this story. And soon, it begins. Chaos drove us from the cities. Fear kept us away. Long after the bombs had fallen, after plagues and famine had run their course, we few that remain live in fear. And without hope. But this is a new place. A new time. Lost. Soon a time will come when we no longer live in caves. Like moles. Like rats. This is Michael on the radio. How y'all doin' out there? I'm gonna tape this one for ya. And when I split, I'ma put the loop on playback. I think I got enough juice to keep it goin' while I'm gone. What do you guys think? Do you think I'm gonna make it out past Memphis without my hair falling out? Probably not. It's all pretty strange now, isn't it? What was it Dad used to call it? The new depression, Michael. Shit man, depressions are supposed to end. Well, let's see. Hey, got the official weather report here. Looks like sunny and dry. Hot. No surprise there. Here's a little one. Toxicity levels in the Tennessee River are continuing to drop. However they are still high enough to kill you dead so it's advised to stay out of the water, and, say it with me everyone, don't eat the fish. Death, is a familiar face. I am so sick of looking at it. It would've been my dad's birthday tomorrow. In honor of that, I got some new tunes for y'all. Found on a guy who probably won't be needing 'em anymore. I think his name was, Jerry. Did you find anything today? No. But. Shut your eyes. Well, it's the closest we're gonna get to a request show. For now, anyway. While you guys enjoy Jerry's mix, I'm gonna polish off this bottle of bourbon. And no, you can't have any. I've been milking this one since my 21st birthday. And that, people, is what we call discipline. It's Echo Station 97. Who are you? My name's Pierre. You don't need to worry about me. You shouldn't do that, that's selfish. Why? You want one? No, they'll get you killed. I don't believe in cancer. It's not cancer, it's a stench. That smell will give you away. You've gotta be more careful if you're going up there. Look around you, man. Think I got all this stuff on the Internet? I know my way around. Wasn't sure how much it was you or your father. It was both of us. I like the maps. It's a good collection. Kind of a reminder. How long you been listening to the show for? A long time. Back when it was just your dad. I took your bullets out. So what do you want? Two weeks ago I heard a voice on the radio. Not you. Another voice. It was a week. I could barely understand him, but there's someone else out there. I want you to help me find him. Those other stations have been down for 15 years. Even if you heard what you thought you heard, what makes you think that it's gonna be any better out there on the other side than it is right here? Do you remember what happened when the IDP camps disbanded? People scattered. The ones who survived went underground. What about children? When's the last time you saw a little boy or girl, five or six years old playing out in the sun? It's not safe out there for kids. It's been 15 years since I saw a living child. Well maybe their parents are doing a really good job keepin' 'em hidden. Help us. We can't live like this forever. I'm sorry about your friend. Burn 'em both. What's is gonna be? What are you doing? The water level was too low. Well we only have seven gallons of water left. You gonna cut my head off, too? Come here. What the hell are you doing? I'm pouring water. Stand up. That shotgun is not loaded. I've counted the number of times you've shot that Remington. The last one was on November 11th. You are out of shells. Move it inside. My. I love what you've done with the place. Sit down. What were you doing outside our house? Your house? I bet not. Where did you get that water? A well. What well? One question a piece. My turn. That is how you two do this, correct? Each person in the room gets to ask one question until everyone's motives are out in the open. Aren't you curious how I knew that? Is that your question? Is that yours? How did you know that? The same way I know that you lost your husband, Thomas, six months ago. And you haven't given up looking for your son. And your husband. You look for them every day. Though, not too far from the house. Get out of our house. I should tell you this is my house, those are my books, that is my reading chair. I got that printed in Nova Scotia in 1983 on a photo safari. The minkes and the humpbacks put on quite a show. Can you hear them, Margaret? Who are you? Dr. Samuel Singleton. Beneath this basement is a sub-basement I built just in case. You've been hiding from us this whole time? Well it worked for Anne Frank. How can this be your house? It was abandoned when we found it. Imagine my surprise when I came home. Not exactly Goldilocks. Aww. Christo. I told you I was gonna see you on the other side. Good to see you, too, Sam. Sam. Yes, Christo. When does the four o'clock train leave? Well Christo I think that it leaves 60 minutes before five. The man told me it left 60 minutes after three. My good man, you're definitely going to catch your train. Ta-da! Tough crowd. Yeah, I know. Have you told them about the road trip? I'm working my way up to that. So one day I'm professor emeritus of history and the next day I'm digging a well, loading up on iodine, paraffin, and toothpaste. And what about the well? Is it dry? Bone dry. It's always dry in August. The rains usually come back in September. How far along are you? Six months? Seven. Almost eight. If it doesn't rain today, right now, we're not going to make it until September. Rain dance? Or, we could see the clouds. Do you know anyone with a hot air balloon? No. I do know a place, it's down the road a bit. Massive walled stone with three openings. Spring-fed lake. Do you know the place? Of course I do. Of course you do. It's too far. It's our only option. It's too far for her. I can make it. She can make it. I better get this in the ground before it stinks up the place. Sarah. You know what this is? It's the watchful eye, the eye of God. It was conceived as the antithesis of the evil eye, the eye of jealousy and envy. It's beautiful. Margaret is divine protecting you from the outside. But now, it's time for you to move past this house. Here, you keep the eye. For luck. Shhhh. Kill those lights. Speak, monkey. She wanted lights. And the fuel? I filled it. It wasn't time. But she said... No. It wasn't time. But she said... I didn't say. Try to find some kind of irritation of the stomach lining. Nausea, diarrhea, opening sores, elevated blood pressure. Is it a good day, Dilcy? Cluck for me, Delinda. You two need your medicine. The lights are on. I see that. You're not supposed to have 'em on. You'll just have to go out and pump some more gas then, won't you? Did Janus find you? Yeah. Did you put him to bed? No. What about my radio boy? I couldn't get him. Why not? He had help. So did you. He had more help. Why was it so important to get to him before he left? So his balls didn't rot off in the corridor. That's right. Like your little rotten seeds. Your fuckwit nieces are outside. You want 'em in or out? Outside. But you could stay. This is Michael on the radio. I guess I gotta cancel that trip to Memphis after all. Apparently they ran out of barbecue and music after the little fallout dusting from nuclear one. Truth is, people, I am headed east instead. Evidently these lonely airwaves ain't so lonely anymore. Had a fella come by today and asked for my help. It's pretty sad that my first reaction was to stick a gun in his face but that's just the way it is, isn't it? So, like I said, I am east or bust. Maybe I can get closer to whoever's broadcasting this new signal. By the way, it looks like I'm gonna be offline for a little while. Fear not, I'll be back with you before you know it. What is wrong with you? I want that baby. What baby? She's stupid enough to get pregnant. She's stupid enough to be out in the open. Who is? Who is? I don't know is, you're supposed to. You're supposed to be the boy with his ear to the ground. 'Nother street boy out there picking pockets. I want my cut, I want that baby. Did you have to run that siren? Don't ask stupid questions. Leave now, take them all with you. Now go on, go on. Have you taken your medicine? You get out, you find the woman, you bring her back here. And you leave now, do you understand me? Yeah. And take him with you. What have I told you? She, she... I don't give a shit if she, she. That stupid siren calls more stupid beggars to this place. More stupid mouths to feed, more shit to clean up. Controlled me, too, associated with painful memories, feelings of complete euphoria. Put a lid on it, Dilcy! Halt! Who goes there? We are but weary travelers searching for food. And, thirsting for water. Well you're shit outta luck 'cause we got neither. Don't lie to me, Quincy. Margaret? I can't believe it. How long's it been, what, forever? Yeah. This is my daughter, Sarah. Holy shit. I mean, excuse me. I'm sorry. You're pregnant. That's right. That's good, it's been kinda boring around here anyway. God, it's good to see you. You, too, Quincy. How's the moonshine business coming? Yeah, it's good. It's not much of a business, though, what I don't give away I drink. This is Dr. Samuel Singleton. Just Samuel, please. You're a doctor. Not the M.D. kind, I'm more like a soul doctor. Well we don't have to tell them. I would like to try them spirits, though. You bet, come on back. Spring-fed lake. A modern Cappadocia. How long have you been here? For awhile. Where's your brother? Is Marcus around? No, he's dead. Got himself killed about a year ago. I'm sorry. How did it happen? Got shot by one of them son of bitch'n snipers. Cut him up pretty bad, too. Sarah? Is she alright? Her husband was killed the same way. I hate this, Samuel. I'm so sick of hiding. I know. We all are. Things will change, you'll see. How? How are things gonna change? Sarah. You're going to have a child and then the whole world is going to change. I'm afraid, Samuel. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. What do you mean the world will change? You know what that is? A blue bottle tree. See, evil spirits are dazzled by the color and the light. And then they're trapped inside the bottle. It's the same blue as the bottle. What do you say? You think that belongs out there? Let's go. That tree isn't a joke, girl. If you hang that there, and your heart isn't behind it, you'll ruin the whole thing. Voila! Found the pistons you wanted. Thanks. Now all I need is a new cam sensor and a few more odds and ends and it'll be all set to go. That him? Yeah. Michael. I know who you are. My name's Quincy. We got your radio booth all set up. We'll go there in a minute. Great. Where's Liam? He didn't make it. Is that him? Yeah. So what do you think? So I shouldn't ask if this place is grounded? Well a few volts might do you some good. Alright. Let's make this happen. I thought this would be more comfortable than just some blankets on the ground. Thank you, Pierre. Pierre. I'm sorry about Marcus. Yeah. He talked about you. Have you made it out to any more of the old campsites? I found two more registries. I'll take you down to the archives later. Hi. Hi. How do you know which pieces go where? I drew a diagram before I took it apart. Could you hand me the wire strippers? It's, yeah, yellow handle on the left. This? Yeah. Thank you. My mother thinks your foolish for trying to talk to that other man. Yeah? She says he's probably a hundred miles away from here. Once upon a time a hundred miles wasn't very far. My mother's just afraid of change. Most people are nowadays. You're, very pregnant. Yes. My name's Sarah. Michael. I know, you're Michael on the radio. Yes. We used to have all this stuff out in the open just under tarps but the moisture in the caves destroyed so much of it. The tank was actually Marcus' idea. Here it is. That book is the list of all the IDPs from the northeast end of the corridor. Give it to me. Ooh son of a, ooh. Can I help? You know how you can keep an old man from losing a finger? Get someone to help. Well there's nobody around here that knows anything about motors but your mother. She's not much on making cars run. Why not? Well cars go places, honey. I've always wanted to drive. Water heater here is gonna run on 200 proof when I get her finished. Which is kinda convenient for me if you think about it. No. I'll take you for a test drive one of these days. I'd like that. I wonder how far this signal is going? Worth a shot. You should be more careful. I take this route down every other day and pump the channel. It's a long shot but there's always hope, right. He's definitely signal boosting onto 97. He's either here or here. He could've moved the equipment from one of those stations. Well, we did. You have no idea how happy that makes me. Sh-shhh. I've spent the last three months trying to find the right... I don't really connect. So anyway, enough of me, I want to hear from you. I'll shut my transmitter off and open the channel up to you. I don't know what kind of music you have but I'm getting pretty tired of my playlist. This is Harvey, over and out. Harvey. My friend Harvey, it's Michael on the radio. God it's good to hear a real voice. Kinda weird, actually. Just heard you for the first time tonight. It must be pretty lonely out there, man. God knows I was. So listen. I've got a special track for you. Let me know if I'm right, will you? Come on, this place is great. Come on, okay, so I know it's not the Ritz-Carlton but... So you're gonna be like that. Okay. Finish your fit. We have a show to prepare for. Leave us. How long do you want to stay here? I don't know. Until your baby's born. I'm not going back to the basement. That's our home. No, it isn't. We don't have a home. We're refugees, remember? Internally displaced persons. Sarah. The world isn't like your books and magazines. It's not like the stories I tell you. Or Samuel's stories. It's dangerous. You have to think about your safety. If you're right then we're just waiting to die. Nice crowd. It is a nice crowd indeed. Why I see heads of state, kings and queens. Then let's make this a good one. One is the loneliest number that I ever knew. But, two's company. And, three is a crowd. Five to 10, if you can tell me what's inside. Nevermind the bet. Don't open it yet. What you were given was lost. No more going down to the store to replace it. But, I know where the wild thyme blows. Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows. Michael on the radio. Michael on the radio, this your friend, Harvey. Good to hear ya, Harvey. I figured someone else out there had that, had to have one of these Echo Station transmitters working. And I'm glad it was your frequency that I boosted. And that song you played, yeah, you got me pegged. Any time I hear that one feels like home sweet home. I'm having some power issues today so I gotta cut this short. My gear is runnin' pretty hot. But give me a day to get it goin' again and let's hook up tomorrow night. I'll call you so leave your transmitter down and your receiver open. In the meantime, music would be nice. Got any Coltrane? It's good knowin' you're out there. That somebody's listening. Harvey out. The rolling store has returned. Manna will be given to those who have waited. For those who have wandered and not lost their faith. All those who wander are not lost. Gifts have been given. Start at the top, break the seal, and unwrap. You, too, Margaret. Don't be shy. Nice ride. Mind if I join ya? Sure. I imagined you differently. That can't be good, can it? No, I... I don't know, you're just, you've been this voice on my radio for so long. Christo, I wonder what else is in the trunk? I don't know what's in the trunk but I want to meet that ballerina. Christo. Back up. Thank you. I'll take extras. What else? Take two. You okay? The baby's kicking. Give me your hand. Why? It's okay. That's kinda creepy. Creepy? No, I just. I've never seen a pregnant woman before. Let alone felt a baby kicking inside her. I should go. I'm really sorry, Sarah. No, Janus. You promised. I said, no. Sarah? There's something you need to see. What about Mother? She'll be fine, let her sleep. Sarah, do you know the story of the sun? At one time the earth was completely covered in darkness. Never any light. Now this was fine for the owl but it was terrible for the bluebird. The animals all got together and they had a meeting to decide what should be done. The very vain Mr. Buzzard said, with my strong wings, I can fly some sun back here in no time. I can put it on my long neck which is covered with beautiful feathers. So he goes, he gets some sun, puts it on his neck. And as he flies back it burns all the feathers off of his neck and rolls back, which is why the buzzard has no feathers today. Mr. Cocky Possum says with my strong beautiful furry tail, I can drag that sun back. So he does, he goes, and he gets some sun, wraps it in his tail, and starts to drag it back, but it burns all the fur off of his tail, and rolls all the way back, which is why the possum has no fur his tail today. Now Grandmother Spider was sitting back watching all of this, and she said, I can bring the sun. And as soon as the animals stopped laughing, they noticed she was gone. She had gone on to the sun and asked, very politely, excuse me, Miss Sun, may I borrow just a little of you to light and warm the earth? She wove a basket, placed some of the sun in her basket, and started her long journey home. Now when the sun burns through the basket, she would stop, and weave it up again. That's why when the sun shines down its rays are like a spider's web and it... Keep going, I think it's working. Watch for it, look closely, you don't want to miss it. Watch for the change. The differences in our choices is very subtle. Six steps to the left and here were are, safe. Six to the right and you're back in the rubble. Where are we? Your home. Down the hall, your mother and father are, debating, dinner plans. Your brother is tiptoeing into your room. Ready to pounce. Why are you showing me this? You only know the outcome of change. The six steps to the right. I wanted you to see your mother's perspective. This is the life she planned for you and David. For herself and your father. Your mother's loss is greater than you can imagine. Allen! What the hell's goin' on with the antenna? Everybody to the back of the cave! Sarah! The hell's goin' on? Well, goddamn, son, somebody's shootin' at us! Don't move. If you run, I'll kill ya. If you scream, I'll kill ya. Sarah! My God, let's go home! Where are they? All along the ridge. Just waitin' for us to move. Let her go! Get away from her! Don't you dare come near her. David, stop. Get out of my way. David, I've been expecting you. What is it? David, ever since she was born I can't take anymore. You just have to... What the hell is this? I'm not leaving without my entire family. I can't leave with the baby and you know it. Take David now. Listen... He's being impossible, I can't handle him. Let me outta here. Who did you see in the cave, Dave? My mother. And sister. Your family. That woman, wants the child, David. No. I'm one of the four myself. The child is the future, David. No. There's nowhere to run, David. Let me outta here. You've got nowhere to go. Let me out. What's that? I can't really hear it. Alright, you shitheads, here comes the sun. I'm alright, no, this ain't that big a deal. I need help! God. He's awful hot. He's gone. You're back. With no baby. You lied to me. I lied? Yeah. You said, my mother was dead. Your mother is dead. She was dead back then and she's dead now. I saw her. That baby's, my sister's. Interesting. It doesn't matter, they're all distractions. What you saw today was weakness. A scared little mouse hiding in caves eating grass to survive. Don't you forget, I found you, I raised you, I fed you. What, you don't want to be like them? No. Of course not. I need a piece of you. For the baby. Now. Is the truck, ready? Was that a poison? Henbane. Let's get on with it. If we're to get there before, then we have to leave now. I know a shortcut. He's not gonna make it. Do you know if he finished his truck? I don't know. I need it to run. And I need you to drive it for me. Where are you going? Michael knows. I don't wanna hide anymore. And I don't want my baby to be born in a cave. If that man on the radio can survive outside the corridor then so can we. That's one of Quincy's flares. It'll be dark in the city, you never know. Keep the radio on. Give you a call when we find him. This is Michael on the radio. Just trying to stay one step ahead of death, who seems to be catching up. I've met a lot of new faces, Harvey. And said goodbye to a few before I should have, but the ones who are left, the ones who are left want to do so much more than survive. You know, we're all survivors, right? So. What's next for us? I don't know, man, but I think I might've found an answer. You don't have to know now, you'll see what I mean soon enough, so light a candle for us 'cause we are on our way. Do me a favor. Light a couple more for the ones who'll never make it. I'll see you soon, buddy. Michael out. Michael, look. I see it. Let's get out of here. No! Jesus! Are you okay? Yeah. Are you okay? Are these people, please be people. Take the wheel. My girls are here. What happened? Please let me live. What happened? Follow me. God, God! Our escort attacked us. There are no baths. Can you help me? They've been shot. Their escort turned on 'em. One of the girls is bleeding badly. Is that him over there? We can't just leave them out here. I didn't say we were. I just don't like it. Next time you check with me. I can't see a damn thing. Look over there. Are you okay, honey? Yeah, just too many bumps. She's going into labor. Is she okay? I hope so. Yeah. Everything alright here? She's alright. Your wife is going into labor. Can you help her? We found each other for a reason, Michael. I know who you are, you're Michael on the radio. When did it start? At the checkpoint. Maybe sooner, I don't know. We'll get you out of here. God, we'll get you out of here. Can you, can you walk? Yeah. I'm unarmed. Harvey? Yes, my God, yes. Michael. Is this it? Can you, do you have a cot or something we can put her on? Yes, of course, of course. Yes, of course, let me see. Let me help you. You are about ripe. That's it, keep walking. Keep breathing. Come on, you can make it. Just a few more steps. How much further? It's right over here, over this way. Come on. Get her food and white towels. Come on, almost there. Breathe. Get that pillow. Almost there, almost there. I didn't think it would hurt so badly. Honey, it's gonna be okay. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, keep breathing, keep breathing. Hey, hey. Hi. Hi. Hang in there, okay? Okay. Michael. We need towels, warm water, and some privacy. Okay. I'll be back. Harvey. How's she doing over there? Much better, I think the bleeding stopped. What happened to you guys? Look, it all happened so fast. We were trying to make our way to the northern enclaves. A man hit me. He attacked my girls. I killed him. Well you'd do the same thing, wouldn't you? Of course. Breathe, breathe, breathe. What's your name? My name's Mynard, Abigail Mynard. Ms. Mynard, tell me your story. I'm afraid it's not a very pleasant one. Well there was going to be a wedding. It was gonna be beautiful. There were roses, flowers, and stuff. I was gonna be on the cover of Bridal South. My family published magazines. Everything was perfect. Only he didn't come. The power went out when the fires started. Then the evacuations. My family left me behind. No, I didn't want to go, I wanted to wait for him. They didn't know I was pregnant. What did you do? I didn't have any help, I didn't know what to do. But I learned. I taught myself. Some of the smaller refugee camps didn't have any midwives so I volunteered. I delivered Dilcy and Delinda. Their mother died of the cholera so I raised them. I believe in providence, Sarah. Our paths were crossed for a reason. It's not very warm, I'm afraid this is a cold water flat. Please. You're doing okay. Where did you find this guy? His name is Christo. Christo? That's, that's, that's fantastic. This is perfect, you have no idea. Excuse me, what time does the four o'clock train leave? Exactly 60 minutes before five. Hey, you know that one? If you two don't mind. Just yell if you need anything. Okay. Come on. This is a lot of dummies. We're not dummies, we're figures. How'd you do that? Do what? Throw your voice like that. Wasn't me. Liar, liar, pants on fire. It's kind of spooky, Harvey. Hence, no. How'd you figure it out? Set everything up. Books. Time. I had plenty of time. What really makes it reach is the tower. Once I got that figured out, it wasn't long after I heard you. A-ha. For Christo. Who's Christo? That's my hat. Hey, do you mind if I play some music? Go right ahead. Thanks. Well, the exodus has returned. Got here safe and sound. I think. It's a story for another day. Found my friend, Harvey. Sittin' up here in his palatial penthouse apartment. Lettin' me spin his gear tonight. A little while ago I was starin' out the window. This great view of desolate city, no. No street lights, no headlights, just the moonlight hanging down over those empty streets. Shit man, I sound like a bad country song, I am so sorry. Speaking of which, I brought some goodies for y'all. Traveled far and wide to play you this song. I've got a friend who's gonna be needing some help through the night, so y'all send a thought out to her, and, Sarah, this one's for you. Until next time, it's Michael on the radio. Hello? A toast, to the baby. Crack. Keep out of reach of children. Obtain medical attention if irritation persists. A big glass. Avoid prolonged contact with skin. Should I feed her now? They'll be plenty of time for that. Margaret. Let's hear your story first. My story. You're tired. Let me help you. Sarah isn't your only child. You had a son. A beautiful strong boy. Not like mine, marked and miserable. Yours tried so hard not to cry sitting there beside his dead father. He should've been here. But seeing you and your perfect daughter, that's what ruined him. My son. Not for internal use. Warning, harmful if swallowed. If swallowed, give water, two glasses of water or milk, and induce vomiting. Call a doctor immediately. David. Crack. You look terrible. What is it? David, you've got poison in your system. You've got an infection. What? What is it? You bitch. David. You can't have her. David? You don't play him. No he's not. Your minions are here. Michael? Michael, wake up, Michael. Michael, wake up, wake up. There's somebody else here. Mama's here, mama, mama. My baby. Hey. Hey. Hey. What? Mother. What? Mother. My God. What do you know? David. David. David. No, no. David, come on, come on. You can live. You can live. David. David! What's her name? Samantha. The whole world's gonna know about you, little girl. The walls of the southern corridor have been breached. Break out the ticker tape and pop the corks off the Maker's Mark. Guess that's what I should be saying, right? Truth is I've been to the other side and the food tastes just about the same. I guess you're all wondering about Sarah. The few who knew her, anyway. Did she have her baby? Yes, she did. A beautiful little girl named Samantha. What's the world gonna be like for little Samantha? A better one, I hope. You know I've spent so much time looking for answers. What went wrong, why did all of this happen? And the truth is that it doesn't really matter who shot first. My dad always told me not to dwell on things, so let's take this chance to start over, and to reach out, and to find one another. Alright, I'm sorry. I won't get too preachy. But just remember that Sarah found her way out because she wanted it bad enough. And now I've got a bigger radio with a better antenna. So what do ya say? Who's out there? If I have learned anything on this crazy journey, it is this one little thing. Hope combines. You guys wanna hear some music? I know I do. Until next time, it's Michael on the radio.
