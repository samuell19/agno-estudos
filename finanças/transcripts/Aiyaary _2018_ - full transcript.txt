Sir. Ease, Captain. Do you know who I am? Sir. Brigadier K. Srinivas, sir. Sit. Captain, where is Major Jai Bakshi? Sir, this is what we were trying to find out. Where is he hiding? Your unit chief. Where is Abhay Singh, Captain? Sir, he is Colonel Abhay Singh. Right. And you are an idiot, Captain. You people are loyal towards a man who has abandoned all of you and is hiding somewhere. He is a cheat and a traitor. Sir, Abhay Singh first went to the US and then Israel for his special training. After the completion of his training the officials of Mossad asked him not to return to India because he had turned out that good. They gave him an unbelievable offer, sir. Even then, he came back to India. I know that story. What else do you know? Sir, there is a plot in Colaba, Mumbai. It's ahead of Sea Castle. There is a small dog on that plot who's always.. - Shut up! So, he has taught you guys the same story. You are crazy. Sir, I am not crazy. Sir, the ones who are really crazy are Colonel Abhay Singh and Major Jai Bakshi. Sir, may I ask you something? Ask. How do you decide? What do you mean? What is right and what is wrong.. And what needs to be done.. How do you decide? Jai, in our job, we can't afford confusion. We don't have time to be confused. But, what if there is time? There are two roads, one heading left and one, right. How do you decide which way to go? I toss a coin. What? - Yes. I read somewhere, that when we have options to choose from and are confused, we should toss a coin. Because when the coin is in the air there'll be a moment when you are completely sure of what you want. Hello. - I'm on. Jai.. Jai, are you sure about this? I don't have an option, Soniya. Okay. I'll see you in London. Bye. See you. Take care! Of course! Sir, tea. Sir. - Yes. - Tea, sir. Sir, he is breaking the previous record. We've been waiting for 17 days. I think it's 12. No, sir. It's been 17 days. Is that right, Balram? - I apologise, sir. It's actually been 17 days. I'll put an extra bullet in him. Aubin. - Yes, sir. Verify it. - Sir. Balram, get the bullets. - Sir. In the second row, near the clothes stall.. Did you see him? - It's him, sir. Is it him? - Yes it is. Sir, tablets. What's this? Your medicines, sir. You said keep it in the bag when we left the hotel. And I kept it. Where is the ammunition pack. It's safe in the hotel's locker, dir. There's nothing to be worried. It's completely safe. It's safe? - Yes, sir. For the last 12 days? For 17 days, sir. Sir.. - Sir.. Please. - But, sir.. You were in the Indian army, MI and now on a special operation. I asked you for bullets and you are showing me the bottle of Vitamin D3 tablets. F-Forgive me, sir. - I'll give you one.. - Sir. It was a mistake, sir. - Please, sir. We're here to assassinate him. You want to kill him by feeding vitamin tablets? He wants to assassinate a high value target by feeding him vitamins. Forgive me, sir. - Sir, please let go. He got his visa for the first time. We've found him with great difficulty. We can't let him go. Sir, we should try tomorrow. He's always armed and very dangerous. What did you say? He's always armed and very dangerous, sir. Aubin. - Sir. - Listen. You guys get to the hotel and clean up everything. Call Omar and ask him to book the return flight. We need a dead drop. Dump everything there. And email me my boarding pass. Yes, sir. But, sir. How will we do it? Now that we are out, we'll do something. Let's go, and don't forget to take the pouch from the safe. He asked me to take the bullets while he was having breakfast. What should I make of it. You tell me. Well.. Excuse me, sir. Give me a minute, sir. - Sure. Jai Hind, sir! - Jai Hind! General Gurinder is here. - Send him in. - Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Please come. - Okay. Lt. General Gurinder Singh! Hello. - Hello, Chief. How are you? - Good, Chief. Please. Sarfaraz. - Yes, sir. Please send in two cups of tea. - Yes, sir. Thank you. So? - Thanks, Pratap, for your recommendation. I have got very bored post retirement. If I become the PTNO chief, then I would owe it to you. You know how I feel, Gurinder? If you deserve it, you will get it. Tell me. What was the urgent matter? Yes. I am actually here to return the favour. I'm here to make you an offer.. To give you a message on behalf of a few friends from an organisation. Like you, even we understand the importance of state-of-the-art equipment and weapons in the Indian Army. I have been a soldier. A decorated one at that, so, yes. I know its relevance. - Go on. Your office has withheld the clearance of a Czechoslovakian arms company's renewal order. 18 weapons, international. They have been wanting to meet you for two months but your office isn't giving them an appointment. These weapons, trucks and tanks are really good, Pratap. And these people even want to create a fund in the Indian Army which will be beneficial for war victims, widows, and families. Being the army chief, you will be the in-charge of this fund. You will be the sole authority to decide as to what to do with this money. They want to donate 2.5 million for this noble cause. Are you trying to bribe me, Gurinder? No.. Not at all. I wouldn't dare to do that. This is just a business propo.. Gurinder, I know that in our country there's corruption everywhere. But let's have some shame. If we sell the entire country, what will be left? Presently, you are representing the arms lobby of our country. That's why I am saying this. Ask them to wait for some time.. That is, as long as I am in this position. Post my retirement, they may bribe the one who replaces me. No.. Don't get me wrong. The politicians will play politics. The businessmen will make money. But the soldier has to fight. These are really good equipment, Pratap. At four times the price! Four times! Pratap, you had sanctioned a special covert unit two years ago. Named DSD. Data and systems diagnostics. Where does the funding for this come from? What does this special covert unit do, Pratap? We have operational details that two years ago, you had asked Col. Abhay Singh to form the DSD and lead it. A team of seven members was formed to carry out special assignments. What you are doing in the name of counter-intelligence is wrong, Chief. Funds have been mobilised from your office without proper authorisation. You have misused your position and power. Are you planning a coup? Pratap, the situation is that your colonel barges anywhere with his team and does whatever he feels like and we know that right now he is in Cairo. You're sleeping with the CIA, MOSSAD, MI6. Even I and I.. These are international violations. They are doing this to protect this country. Darn it! - I know. They like what they are doing. You like what you are doing. We like what we are doing. Why don't you understand that it's in everybody's interest? If this Czechoslovakian company's arms order gets renewed, everyone will be pleased. I will be pleased as my task will be accomplished. You'll be pleased because you'll get state-of-the-art weapons. And, Pratap, it's not like you are spending from your pockets. What's the problem? Darn it! It's just the darn taxpayers' money! I will call you on Monday. Is everything fine at home? See you. Ask Lt. Col. Anees to prepare a report. Yes, sir. Jai Hind, sir! Sir, he has landed. Keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir. Jai Hind, sir! - Sir! Hello. What's happening? - I was setting the question paper. Keep it a little easy. There's a lot of pressure on students these days. Do I tell you how to do your job? Sorry. I don't even know what exactly it is that you do, Colonel. Lakhan. - Yes, sir. Drive fast. - Yes, sir. Didn't you get Kunal with you? - He had gone to bed early. Did you leave him alone? Will I leave him alone? The maid is at home. This fatherly love that gets awakened once you are home.. Sorry. - Sorry, seriously.. By the way, once I am home, even the feelings of a husband.. What are you doing? You are impossible! Sir, a vehicle has been following us for a long time. What is it? A white-coloured Innova, sir. No problem. Wake me up if it comes very close. - Yes, sir. Abhay. - Yes. Abhay. - Yes. It's Maya's call. Let's finish our breakfast. Mom. - Yes. - Mom. - Yes, dear. Hello. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Sir, Major Jai Bakshi is missing. Missing? Since when? For the last three days. And, sir, I've just learnt that three days ago he has withdrawn all the money from his savings account. He is completely off the radar! Which was the desk that he used to sit at, last? Sir, at the Nepal desk. For the past one month, he has been handling phone surveillance here in Delhi. Also, I think, there's more to this, sir. His last month's cell phone bill is Rs. 212. Whereas his average bill is around Rs. 1,200, sir. He has started using another number. I will be there in an hour. - Yes, sir. What's bothering you so early in the morning? - What? What's bothering you? The government is going to decrease tax on every item. Nonsense! Don't tell me if you don't want to. Hold him. I will serve breakfast. Spend some time at home too. And everyone keeps asking why you are so late. Nonsense! Even your mom feels that I don't share anything. Yes. I don't share. He is here. Jai Hind, sir.. Jai Hind! Has anything been missing? - This way, sir. Sir, Jai had been in our server room two nights ago. And he took away a few hard drives from this rack. Sir, those drives contained phone interceptions, recordings and a lot of data. Please watch this, sir. Aubin. Maya. Clean up the place and check the papers. - Sir. We've to move to the hangar. We'll operate from there. Okay, sir. - Hack his email account WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter.. His girlfriend.. Sonia. Where is she? Sir, even her phone is switched off. Even she he is missing. Jai's mother? - She is here. Welcome to our hotel, sir. - Hi. Sameer Roy. I've a booking. - Certainly, sir. Give me a moment, sir. I got your booking. Please sign here. Thank you for the information. Have a great stay. Good morning. You've reached Hotel Seema. Hello, ma'am. Please connect me to room number 212. Please hold on, sir. Hello. Baburao. This is Jai Bakshi. Jai, of all the places, where did you put me up? There are a lot of bed bugs here. Why did you receive the call? Didn't I tell you not to pick up any calls? But why did you dial here? Baburao, what did I tell you? Not to receive any calls. That's not the way. Heck! Good morning. You've reached Hotel Seema. Ma'am, please connect me to room number 212. Sir, I'd connected the call just a minute ago. Just a moment. Hello. - Hello. Please. - After you. So, in the name of funds Gurinder was trying to bribe you. Wow! And I was of the notion that only India politics was dirty. Even the army has enough problems. How can I help you? Sir, the Indian army orders specially designed trucks from a Czech Republic based company. On paper, these trucks are first sent to Hong Kong. From there, to London.. Only on paper, mind you, sir. And from London, these trucks are sent to India. This is done only to justify the cost. But in reality, all of the trucks are directly shipped to India from Czech Republic. Call it transaction cost.. Call it commission.. Everything put together, for the Indian army these trucks cost four times more. The structure of the new arms deal is somewhat like that. That's why, I didn't renew the order. The consequence.. The war widow funds offer. Kamya. Hi, sir. - Sit. Sit. Sorry to keep you waiting, Kamya. That's all right. You look stunning as usual. Thank you. You still are the best liar. How is that peace campaign of yours going? Good. Very good. In fact, you'll be surprised to see that there are still a lot of people who want India and Pakistan to reconcile. They want peace. Even I want that. Retired Lieutenant General Gurinder Singh, Indian Army wants peace. Wow! Your show is on channel number three. Do you want to increase the TRP, Kamya? No. I can't do anything. Sir.. - I'd told you when the DSD unit was formed. The government will always deny knowledge of its existence. That's it. That was the deal. - Yes. But, sir, this is a bit complicated. If our operational details are leaked all our sources and assets will be exposed. They will be hung out to dry. It's a different matter that people will lose faith in the military intelligence. That's why, we need to stop Gurinder. Not me, you need to stop him. It's your chaos, Chief. You will have to handle it yourself. I have a source who has such details which will catapult your channel to the number one position. You need to start a smear campaign against the present army chief. You will give a good PR to the next army chief. We want General DK Sharma to be the next army chief. Who's we? You and me. Let the government believe that they're running the country. We'll decide upon this country's next.. Who is your source? 'You know what, that model wrote the tender amount' 'with a red lipstick.' 'Believe me, I felt so excited..' 'What do I tell you?' 'What are you saying? - That was yesterday.' 'You know what happened this morning? - What happened?' 'Mr. Shastri called me in the morning.' 'He said, the cadres aren't happy with his work.' 'I told to myself, he is useless.' 'He just says useless things.' Arun. Arun. - Sorry. Where is the boss? - Temple. Are you done shifting? - Sir! All okay? - Yes, sir. He told me that he's going to Jaisalmer on an assignment. He said, his phone will be switched off and he will contact me. It has happened earlier too. I'm used to this. I hope he's not in some kind of trouble, Abhay. No, ma'am. He's a soldier. He's not in trouble. May I see his room? - Sure. Go ahead. Sir. He never discusses work with me but he holds you in high regard. He always says that he wants to become like you. Is that so? Does he get something for you or does he spend it all on himself? He doesn't spend money on himself. He is always concerned about me and my health care. Three days ago, he withdrew money for me before leaving. Excuse me, sir. All good. Where is his passport? - It's here. It's kept outside. - Good. Ma'am, don't need to approach the police. We will find him and send him to you. You just pull his ears. Okay, bye. Of all the people a third generation soldier.. Darn! His loyalty has been compromised. He has gone rogue. He will be in disguise. Either he has already left the country or he is about to. But sir, his passport is here. Where was it kept? - It was kept outside. Right. I trained him. He wanted us to find it easily and look the other way. Issue a warrant against Jai Bakshi. Sir. - Sound an alert everywhere. Yes, sir. Yes, Maya. - Major Jai put 22 people under human surveillance. He met Mr. Chaudhary too. He forged your signature and issued the order. For how many people did I authorise surveillance? Only four people. Jai authorised the rest of the 18 names. Very interesting list, sir. - Send it through WhatsApp. Sir. Both of you, go to the airport and enquire about Sonia. Sir. - Right, sir. - I have a feeling that she has flown out. I am going to meet Mr. Chaudhary. Sir. - Okay. - Sir. "Your love has drowned me." "Yes, your love has drowned me." Liar. Excuse me. - Yes. Are you.. - Abhimanyu Singh. Sonia Gupta. - Hi. Please come. Would you like to have something? - Cappuccino, please. - Sure. Hi. One cappuccino, please. Thanks. I read your profile on LinkedIn. It's very impressive. And at such a young age. Wow! - Thank you, sir. Please call me Abhimanyu. - Yes. You don't mind me saying but you don't exactly look like the.. The IT type? Well, you don't look like the businessman type yourself if you don't mind me saying that. You know what, Sonia! Strictly between you and me. I am still figuring out how to be a businessman. Excuse me, ma'am. Your cappuccino. Thank you. Sugar? - Yes, one please. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So about us.. I am from Chandigarh. We are in the process of buying a data management company. By 'we' I mean my promoters and I. This company has lots of data including the details of the top three banks of this country. We want an IT company to give us a report about this deal and their security systems before locking the deal. Not only that we also want them to design IT security solutions for the same company. You know, firewalling, encryption.. The works.. Right. Is it your own company? - Yes. How many employees do you have? Only me. - Sorry? I am the only employee of my company. I hire freelancers like coders, engineers based on the projects. But you know, this is really big. How will you.. Is that your laptop? - Yes. Is it secured? - Completely. May I? - Yes. That's fine. Just leave it as it is. But it's password protected. - That's fine. Thank you. Okay. So.. Abhimanyu Singh. Password.. Let's see. St. Aloysius.. Batch.. St. Stephens.. That should be okay. Bank account details. Oh! HBSC. Yes. It will ask for my username and password. I didn't save it. - That's fine. I'll still try. Account.. Add to cart.. Payment details. Bank account details. I have done online shopping for myself using your card. That must be the transaction alert. Wow! Impressive. Thank you. Wow! Really impressive. How did you do this? - Thanks. "Every time I meet you" "the same magic happens." "Everything within me" "starts to adorn itself." "So many memories get formed in just one moment." "I laugh so much that I get teary." "Your love has drowned me." "Yes, your love has drowned me." Happy birthday. - "Your love has drowned me." "Yes, your love has drowned me." "Nowadays my eyes" "are very busy." "As the entire day goes by" "looking at you." "And when you pass by" "slowly touching me" "my heart slowly" "melts in your warmth." "Your love has drowned me." "Yes, your love has drowned me." "Your love has drowned me." "Yes, your love has drowned me." Assembly language is a must. It's a basic language that understands every programme. Actually, you can't really exploit a programme unless you know assembly. Are you listening? - What? Yes. Would you like to have anything else? No, thanks. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. Can you get the bill? By the way, you didn't tell me what time we are meeting tomorrow. Because there is so much work to be done. And the emails I sent you.. - Excuse me. Just a moment. Sure. - Good evening, sir. Yes, sir. Major! Come, Sonia. Let's.. Who are you? Look, Sonia.. - Who the hell are you? Get out, Abhimanyu. Or whatever your name is! Please hear me out, Sonia. - Out. I'm Major Jai Bakshi. Indian Army. But they will soon declare me as a deserter and a traitor. I will be hunted and then court martialled. I have to leave this city as well. I don't want to leave without apologising to you. Please, just hear me out for once. I work for this system and the government in military intelligence. I'm in a special covert unit. Something like Secret Service. Guys like us need different people to complete our missions. We treat them like disposable assets. We just vanish from their lives. One day, on my current assignment.. 'Sir, these are the details of the new information received.' 'Go and find a hacker. Preferably female' 'who is an expert in Linux, Wireshark and TCP dump.' 'Take up a new identity. Hire her and learn from her.' 'Sir.' You were an ideal candidate. You are a single working woman, living alone, far away from your parents. So, I had shortlisted you. I hired you under my fake identity of Abhimanyu. You unknowingly taught me everything that I wanted to learn. That was not the end of it, Sonia. During this assignment, I slowly realised that I'm only a soldier by profession. Our superiors actually don't care about out intelligence reports. Money is what they care for. And who was I helping them rob by the way? The very people I had sworn to protect in the first place. I was in such a situation that even if I had minded my own business, I'd still be betraying my nation. Then I decided not to be a part of this conspiracy anymore. Then I fell in love with you. I just had to learn the skills from you and then I wouldn't have had anything to do with you. But everything had changed that evening, Sonia. Everything changed. I don't know when I fell asleep while working and.. 'See.' 'Coffee.' 'I think I should leave.' 'Shit!' That was the first time I realised that you'd fallen for me. And maybe I'd fallen for you too. I knew, I couldn't vanish from your life, Sonia. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Hello. - It's me. You know what? I was thinking about you. Where are you? Long Acre. I am waiting for the bank to open. Good. Text me the details once you open the account. Sure. Aren't you leaving tonight? Yes. Same flight. Pick me up from the airport? - Yes. Okay. See you. Oh, my! Sir.. He called me many times. It's chaos everywhere. People are demanding information. Be it the Army, cops even the telecom department. Sir, we have representatives from different departments here. They are putting pressure on us. What did you do, sir? Stop faltering. Take a deep breathe. You may experience a heart attack otherwise. Who is taking care of the surveillance? It's not active as of now. Jai had switched it off yesterday. Do you have any report.. - No. Jai has everything. How many people are on surveillance? You asked for 22. There are 22. On the top of it, more than 40 people are providing us with inputs. Sir.. Please, sir. - Take care. What.. Hi, Anees. Sir, you were right. Sonia has left for London yesterday. The UK border control has confirmed her entry. Was somebody else accompanying her? Negative, sir. She was alone. Ask Indian and UK authorities to be on full alert for Jai. - Yes, sir. Meet me at the hangar. - Okay, sir. Why the hell is Brigadier Sarfaraz is calling me now? Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Abhay. The chief wants to meet you at his residence tonight. Come and meet him at 19:00 hrs. And yes. He has asked you to enter through the backdoor. I will be there, sir. Sir, he is standing outside the South block. He received a call from the chief's office. Hello. Where are you? - Not important. I want to renegotiate the deal. This is not fair. Really? Both of us are traitors. So, let's not use the word 'Fair'. Do you understand? What do you want? - Rs. 10 crores. We had settled the deal at Rs. 1 crore. I didn't know that you were about to pay the Army Chief a bribe of 2.5 million dollars in the name of fund. Yes. And that's the reason for this renegotiation. How do you know about it? My boss used to say that listening is a fine art in surveillance. Now I know the importance of his words. Do you even have a clue who you are messing with? Absolutely. - It's not a problem if you want to cancel the deal. No hard feelings. I.. I need to talk to them first. I will call you again in an hour. Darn it! Darn it! Good morning, sir. Yes, Gurinder. Sorry to bother you, sir. Sir, he is demanding more money. He is asking for Rs. 10 crores. And you thought you should call me up to inform me about this. Sir. Sorry, sir. So sorry, sir. I'll handle this, sir. No problem, sir. Sir. Brigadier Srinivas, we have a problem. That's nice. - Very nice. Thank you. - You did very well. Thanks. - Have a good day. 'Alcohol is injurious to health.' You will receive your money tomorrow. You will receive your information tomorrow. I don't know what information you have. But on your say.. - Right! I'm sending a sample. Have a look. Hello, sir. I'm sending the first lot, Kamya. Jai Hind, sir. - How are you, Sukhdev? I'm good, sir. - How are your wife and kids? They are good too. Has your leave ended? Jai Hind. - Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind. Sit. Hello. - 'Sir.' 'He has come to meet the army chief.' Keep me posted. - 'Sir.' Captain. - Yes, sir. Tap Colonel Abhay Singh's phone. - Sir. 18 successful missions out of 18. Congratulations, Abhay. You're still maintaining your 100 percent track record. Thank you, sir. When I had asked you to form a special covert union two years ago I was worried only about one thing. How long will be able to keep this a secret? Your secret unit is no longer a secret, Abhay. Do you know Gurinder Singh? Lieutenant General Retired Gurinder Singh? What else do you know about him? Gurinder Singh is the front man of Mukesh Kapoor who is a UK based arms dealer. Mukesh Kapoor's strategy is very simple, General Pratap. Through Gurinder Singh he employs retired senior ex-Indian officers in his company because these ex-officers have an in-depth knowledge of the army functioning and their requirements. So, Mukesh Kapoor's company is better equipped to bid for the best deal. Mukesh Kapoor himself is an ex-Indian Army Officer. No one knows why he quit. I have heard that he stays in a high-rise in Central London. That's his office and his residence. General Pratap, he has a strong bond towards Attara Company in Czech Republic. Gurinder wanted to bribe me with 2.5 million dollars for an arms deal in association with the same Czech Republic company. Of course, he was not alone. He was representing the entire arms lobby brokers, arms dealers, politicians, etcetera. He mentioned about your special DSD Unit before I could refuse or oust him from the office. His direct warning was that my most capable officers and me would be targeted if I didn't not accept bribe in this deal. They are going to bring me down, Abhay. And they are going to start with you. They are aware that I had sanctioned Rs. 20 crores unofficially for the operation of your special unit. Your unit, your names and the details of your covert operations will be revealed before the media. I can imagine the headlines. Indian Army's dirty secrets. Being the unit chief they will first discredit you, taint you and then destroy you. You will be labelled as a traitor. You will be proved a traitor. I have a doubt that somebody from your unit has been bribed. It is Major Jai Bakshi, sir. That bright kid? Sir. You know the rules, Abhay. I will have to officially cut you lose right away. I can understand, sir. I have got to know that Brigadier Srinivas has been called on special orders to expose you. Be careful. Sir. Sir, I want your order unofficially. Sir, I want your order unofficially. These bastards should not win this battle, Abhay. They will sell our country if they win. People shouldn't lose their trust in the Indian Army at any cost, Abhay. You are a soldier who has never let me down. Do whatever you need to do. But these bastards should not win this battle. Sir! Abhay, I will always be proud of you. It's a pity that no one will ever know what you and your unit has accomplished for this country. It doesn't matter, sir. It's been an absolute honour serving under you, sir! Jai Hind. - Jai Hind. 'What is this new assignment?' 'And why have you booked a new flat?' 'If I don't return home someday' 'assume this to be me and..' 'Brigadier Srinivas, he just got into the car.' Is the car behind us? - Yes, Colonel Abhay. Leave for Chandigarh. Don't go over 40 kilometres per hour. I will get down at the ISBT bus stand. Okay, Colonel Abhay. - Let's go. Abhay, where are you? I have some urgent work. I have to leave for Chandigarh immediately. Why are you going all of a sudden? When will you return? Look, I'll call you once I reach there. Abhay, but.. Hello. Hello.. Follow his car. - 'Sir.' Report every movement of his. - 'Yes, sir.' 'When will you return?' 'Look..' 'Chandigarh. Compromised phones will be tapped.' 'We are under surveillance. I'm around.' Lakhan. - Yes. Slow down the car towards the left. Colonel Abhay. - Colonel Abhay. Slowly. Guys, we are burnt. All of you switch off your phones. Start using new numbers. Nobody will go home. - Yes, Colonel Abhay. Hari. - Colonel Abhay. Make a list of all our sources and accesses. Divide that list amongst yourselves. Contact each one of them and ask them to go underground. Nobody will sleep till each one of them has been contacted. - Colonel Abhay. All our records and data.. This number is.. Jai. - Good evening, sir. Why are you doing all this? Sir, whatever is happening.. Stop calling me sir! Sir, the army chief has disowned all of us. Do you know that this was the deal? Only if we get caught during the call off duty. Only if we lose our lives during the call off duty. But I cannot respect our army chief if he disowns us after getting threatened by an ordinary arms broker of our country. If the army chief thinks he can cut me lose then thank you. I will cut lose myself. Choose your next few hours very carefully, Jai. I'm choosing them very carefully, sir. They will not spare you too. Please take ma'am and go somewhere. Ask the team to leave too. This mess is not worth fighting for. I'm giving you 24 hours. I won't share any information with anybody else till then. And I am giving you one hour, Jai. Surrender yourself. I am not promising you. But I will try not to kill you with my own hands. I had to give you a warning. I have done that. Now, you can do anything, sir. I will find you, Jai. And pray that.. - No, sir. You will not be able to find me. You are forgetting that I have learnt everything from you itself. But still, I will give you 24 hours, sir. Bye. This loser is still here. He is not giving me time. He himself wants time. Maya. - Sir. Book me on the first flight to London. Sir. - Hari. - Sir. Ask the airport security to be on alert. He is certainly planning to leave tonight itself. Take care. - Jai Hind. 'The car has not stopped even once' 'from the past three hours? - Yes, sir.' 'We had to stop the car twice.' 'But the car is moving without stopping anywhere.' What is the speed? 'Not above 40 or 50, sir.' Overtake the car and check whether anybody is in the backseat or not. 'Sir.' 'Sir.' - Yes. 'Sir, there's nobody in the back seat.' What! Thank you. Excuse me. Can you take me out for a drive? I'm sorry. I'm waiting for someone. Okay. Excuse me, please. Don't wait too much. It'll prove costly. Hi! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Tariq. But it's not good to see you lying. Why do you look worried? It's the job. Why do you need these? I'll tell you. Mr. Tariq, how many Indians are on surveillance in London? Around 15 to 20. - Pakistani? 25 to 30. Israeli, Americans.. More than 50. The rest are always there. How many are there like you who are playing in every team? I'm alone. Tell me, what is the matter? I need to find this girl, Mr. Tariq. She has been in London for the past two days. Activate all your locals. Hotels, transport, shops, SIM card vendors.. Get them cracking. She must've gone to Oxford street for shopping if she has been in London for two days. Who is she? Jai. Jai! Coffee. Thanks. What are you thinking? Nothing. I recalled an incident. Share it with me. We were in the valley.. In Sopore. We used to work closely with the BSF. We had an asset called Sheru. He was really good. Hello, sir. - How are you, Sheru? I've some news. - Come inside. We used to get a lot of inputs from him. With the help of the intel he provided we carried out 4 to 5 major operations. Did he call from the bus? - Yes, sir. Mr. Abhay used to like him a lot. Whenever he met Sheru, he used to pay him some money. One day, Sheru went missing. He just vanished. After a week, there was an ambush at the army camp. 19 of our soldiers were killed. Mr. Abhay's network was very strong. He came to know that it was Sheru who shared the camp details with the militants. He kept us at standby and went out all alone. Leave me alone! Don't come near me! Wicked children! Back off! Get away from me! God Almighty! Show mercy! Get off me! Get lost! Get away from me! Mr. Abhay had the information that Sheru used to visit his uncle's house, every ten days. He stayed there. One can't imagine how he did it. After two weeks and two days.. Stop! What.. - Sir! Sir! Please let me go, sir. Sir.. Sir! Sir! Sir, please! Sir. Sir, please. Sir! Come on! - Sir.. Let me go, sir. - Start the bike. Sir, please. Sir, where are you? Sir, please forgive me. - Keep riding.. Sir, please. - Keep riding. Please, sir. It was a mistake. Jai, serve him some liquor. I'll return in a while. Sir. - It was a mistake. - Can I get hot water to take bath? Yes, sir. - Please, sir! Sir, it was a mistake. Please forgive me. Sheru, you have done us a lot of favours. It feels sad now that I have to kill you. But I know that you won't spare me. Yes, pal. I can't tolerate betrayal. Sir, shall I reveal your name? The name that the Hizbul leader coined for you. Shall I reveal the name? - What's that? Aiyaar. Shall I google it or will you tell me its meaning? A shapeshifter who can change his appearance when he pleases. The one who knows magic tricks. They tried to kill you four times last year but you managed to survive. So, the leader regards you as Aiyaar. You are a master of disguise. Any last wishes? Sir, serve me some noodles. Do you have noodles with you? No, sir. - Jai. - Sir. Get some noodles. Let's feed him. Otherwise, I will have to bear that sin. Sir. Pour another drink. Sorry, pal. It's an emergency. A random person says it's an emergency situation. Sorry. - That won't help. You have woken up an old guy in the middle of the night. What's wrong with you? - Thank you. Leave now. - Here. No.. Leave.. - Thanks. So, that's the man, Sonia. Okay.. Why is he so fond of you? I don't know why. Don't you know? Trust me. I don't know why. Major Jai Bakshi. He turned his back on us. What are you saying? Mr. Tariq, I'll tell you an incident. Do you remember Sheru? - The noodle guy? Yes. One week after that incident we were returning from a so-called peace meeting. Sir, shall I ask you something? - Go for it. Sir, we have so many intellectuals and wise men as our leaders. Why don't we solve the Kashmir conflict once and for all? When a problem benefits many people it remains unsolved. We try to sustain it. Jai, Kashmir is not just a place. It's an industry. Many people are reaping its benefits. Wait and watch.. Sir, it's a puncture. Give me a moment. I will change the tyre. - Okay. Get in.. Sir! Jai, are you fine? Jai! He took two bullets to save my life. I wonder what's wrong with him now. Our sources will be exposed. Mr. Tariq, all of us will die. Hello. - Mr. Tariq. How are you? I'm fine. Who are you? I'm Jai Bakshi. I am unable to get through to Mr. Abhay. Pass the phone to him. Hello. Sir, you left everything behind and came to London? Sir, you won't be able to trace Sonia. Even after trying hard, I could not send her to Oxford street for shopping. Please, sir. It's my last request. Please leave all this and run. Jai, why are you.. - Sir, I learnt many things. You rightly said that listening is a fine art. Upon overhearing the orders for the last one month I came to know how the country is being run and who is running it. It's all about money and power or sometimes both. Sir, didn't you see the list of those 22 people? Sir, forget everything. Such audacity! If the Indian Army doesn't buy weapons from their suggested vendors at four times the market price, they will expose the special unit personnel and their sources! Sir, I'm not a traitor. Perhaps, this institution doesn't deserve an officer like me. Yes. It doesn't deserve you. It deserves more. It deserves people who can show up for a fight. Instead of fighting against injustice you are playing the victim and justifying your actions! Do you think you can lead a peaceful life after this? I'll tell you what. You will always live in fear that someone is tracing you. I will be your worst nightmare! I'll give you a free advice. If you really want to move on, you have to kill me first! You bastard! What's the matter? Mr. Tariq, how can he always be one step ahead of me? That's because he thinks like you. Come again. - He thinks like you. In that case, I should take an unprecedented step. Do you have Mukesh Kapoor's contact number? Jai, the funds have been transferred. Good. Time to make few more calls. Hello. - I have transferred the funds to the account you had mentioned. Thank you. Check your personal Hotmail account at 9:00 p.m. How did you get my personal Email ID? Gurinder, you're not able to run your office properly. How can you run the country? Good bye. 'Sharma, the Colaba plot..' 'Our business will go on, no matter which party..' 'Sharma, send the photographs and bank details' 'to my personal email address' 'Gurinder.. Gunning..' 'G U double 'N' I N G.' 'The watchman of Colaba plot is making more noise' 'than his dogs!' 'Finish him off!' Sir.. 'Let them come.' 'Doesn't matter which party comes to power.' 'It's not going to affect our business.' 'What does 'we' mean? - You and I.' 'Let the government be under the illusion' 'that they're running the country.' 'We'll decide upon this country's next..' Let's wait for him. - Okay. Hello, good morning. Hi, good morning. I'd like to have a word with John 56, please. Can I take your name, ma'am? - No. But you can have a number. It's '885860'. Hold the line, ma'am. Excuse me, John! John! Hello. - Hi! Sonia here. He's with me. Tell me. - We're ready. No, it has to be a public space. Yeah! Yeah, he can be there. We'll be in touch, okay? That's right. Sure. Tariq! - Yes? - I got the message! Take care. Bye. You know that I'm a former Indian Army Officer. I just don't how you, Ex Colonel Mukesh Kapoor became an arms dealer. You have to earn my respect to know that story, Colonel. What do you want? Tell me. I've lost a boy. I don't want to take him back home with me. I want you to find him and kill him. And what will you do for me in return? I don't have to do anything. Your work will be done after you kill him. He has got a few surveillance recordings which can trouble a lot of people. Even you. Me, you, your entire team your sources and also your current army chief.. Yes. It will take me some time to find him, but not for you. And why would I do this for you? When was the last time you spoke to Gurinder, Mr. Kapoor? Who is it? Who are you? Hey.. Where are you taking me? Let me go.. Hey.. Interesting. Gurinder won't be able to keep quiet in front of my team for long. It will not take him too long to tell them about you and your business. If you don't accept my request, I'll take a few people down along with me. Please don't misunderstand me. I've got no personal dispute against you. You're a businessman, arms are products and you're doing your business. Soldiers won't go for war without weapons. But I've got a problem with those pawns of yours, of my country who are helping you with your business by exploiting the country. Excuse me, sir. Your boy, Major Jai Bakshi, will be meeting some MI6 agents in some time. The location is a public place. He's trying to sell them what he sold me. Here's my offer, Mr. Kapoor. I want you to get all the surveillance records that Jai has. It's up to you whether you want it destroyed or not. My team will record all the evidence against you from Gurinder. If you leak any information against us we'll do the same against you. You tell me what has to be done with Gurinder. I don't want Jai and his girlfriend, Sonia, to be alive. I want you to kill them. Are you sure you want it this way, Officer? I'll just have to make a phone call for you. And a few people will set out to do the job after the call. The series of events that transpires after that can't be stopped, no matter what happens. So, I ask you again. Are you sure about this, Officer? I'm very sure, Mr. Kapoor. Your job will be done. All right, Mr. Kapoor. Do tell me if there's anything you'd like me to do for you in the future. Faithful people aren't of any use to me, Officer. Send me a message when you're no longer one. How can I change from being one, Mr. Kapoor? It's nice meeting you. Yes, Tariq? I've found out about Sonia. I've got the number as well. It was given to the local transport. It's the right one. They're in Hotel JW. Let them die. But, Abhay.. Like I said, let those morons die. Who is it? Hello? - It's Abhay Singh, Sonia. If you want Jai to live, ask him to abort the meeting and escape. Only if you want him to live. Hello.. Shit! Hello? - Abort and run! Jai, I repeat! Please, abort and run now! Yes, Roger. 'Sir, I am sorry to report this. The boy got away.' What! Hello. - Shall I come upstairs? Or will you come downstairs? My taxi is waiting outside your hotel. I-I am coming, sir. - Don't make a call to Jai. We will talk to him together. You have one minute. Get going. - Yes. Excuse me, sir. - What! You can't park here. You guys bother only about such silly issues. What's going on in your country.. I was waiting for her. There she is. Yes, Abhay. Tell me. Mr. Tariq, I want to meet Jai. Where should I ask him to come? - I am sending you the address. Is he doing all this at your behest or is it the other way round? Call him up. Sir.. - Call him up. Sonia, what's going on.. - It's me, Abhay Singh. You should thank God that you are alive. I am sending you the address. Reach there. Okay. - Will you come or will you betray this girl too? Send him the address. Someone named Mukesh Kapoor is calling you. Someone! Disconnect the call. A new problem has come up. Sir, it's all over the news. 'Extreme act of daylight shootout.' 'A man was shot in the head in Merchant Square' 'in central London.' 'Sources claimed that the deceased belonged to MI6.' 'The agency has not yet released' 'an official statement about the shootout.' Roger, I need to know who is helping this colonel friend of ours. How much time you reckon it will take? No time, sir. - Good. Sir.. Sir.. Sir, leave.. - Shut up! Sir.. Sir, gun.. Didn't I tell you.. - Sir, please.. ...that I will find you? - Sir.. Sir, I.. - Don't call me sir! Don't! - Sir. I will call you sir as long as I am alive. Shoot me if you can't hear that. I am not wrong, sir. Really? - Really, sir. Sir, did you watch that video in which someone came from behind and pushed a CRPF personal? There was a lot of so called hue and cry. This news grabbed headlines. You watched that video, right? I went through exactly the same. But our political system pushed me. And then I got to know there is so much of corruption and manipulation in every field. It's all just a bloody business. You asked me to wear headphones listen calls and tell you what's going on. I started listening, sir. First, I found one person. Then two.. Then three.. And like you said, everyone is corrupted. Only 14 per cent people of our country pay tax. And everyone is enjoying with that money. And those who raise questions against the beneficiaries are the ones who get killed. And the honest people.. People like you, who want to work are assigned minor tasks to keep them busy. That's the only difference, sir. I, Major Jai Bakshi, can't be busy for no reason. I don't have a problem with sacrificing my life. Even you know this. But whom should I die for? There was a thief who started screaming after getting caught. 'Look.. He is a thief.' 'Look.. That person is a thief.' 'There are thieves everywhere.' It's a wrong story. There was an honest soldier. He fought hard and got very far. When he opened his eyes he found himself surrounded by thieves. He thought through and took off his uniform. Either you can stop this story here or you can come to a conclusion that the soldier didn't steal when he was in uniform. Jai, your generation.. Sorry to interrupt you, sir. But this is not fair. Our previous generation encouraged corruption in the last 70 years not our generation. You are elder to me. I respect you. But what are you leaving behind for us? We are dealing with somebody's lack of honesty, sir. And I am not complaining. I am just refusing to be a part of this. To heck with you! - Sir.. Sir, gun.. Please. Sir, please. Gun.. Jai.. You have the right, sir. Whether you accept it or not.. To think like this.. I learned it from you only. Sir, please.. So, this is your stance. - Yes. Let's do business. What do you say? You want to do business, right? What do you want? - Our unit, our sources.. They shouldn't be harmed. And in return, you and this girl are free to go anywhere. I will spare both of you. Either you accept the deal or I will kill you and die. And you very well know how much I care for my life. The shapeshifter's disguise! You will leave us for today. But in the future.. Have you started losing confidence? No, sir. My confidence in you has increased now. Mukesh Kapoor. There are already enough problems and.. We have a deal, sir. Let me answer the call. Hello, Mr. Kapoor. Major Jai Bakshi here. Hi, Jai. You think you can get away with all this. Yes. And you will help me. I have your recordings with me. And it's not saved on a pen drive or a laptop that you will kill me and save yourself by getting hold of it. That data is saved in 12 different accounts. I can sit in any coffee shop access that data using free Wi-Fi and share it. And if anything happens to me by chance and I don't contact my sources in the next 24 hours even they can access and share that data. Do you understand me, Mr. Kapoor? What do you want? - Ask your guys to back off now. Tomorrow, I will come to your office to meet you. Let's do some business together. Is that okay with you? Okay. Mr. Abhay, let me tell you this. A person has been hiding in room number 212 of Seema Lodge, Paharganj, since last three weeks. His name is Baburao Shastri. He has a story that will help you a lot. Sir, there is a plot in Colaba, Mumbai near Sea Castle. There was a dog out there, it was always sick. Sir. - Roger, let him go. Okay, sir. Number 2. Insert three exclamation marks too. What else do you know? Sir, there is a plot in Colaba, Mumbai in front of Sea Castle. There was a dog who was always sick.. - Shut up! It's just a scratch. You will be fine. Can you hold this for me? - Yes. What? - Baburao? Hello. - It's me, Abhay Singh. I would like to meet you. Hi, Abhay. I am not wired. Trust me. I made that mistake once, Kamya. You know, I miss my boyfriend. You don't have a boyfriend. - Exactly. Are you running that story? Yes, tomorrow morning, breaking news. And you all will be finished by tomorrow evening. You all did whatever you pleased, didn't you? It's still a democracy. Remember. Yes, I remember this. That's why you are telling me all this. I am listening despite being an army man. Why have you called me here? I have a story. Drop the other story if you run this. Between both the stories which one is more important and should be aired.. I am leaving it to you. What does it contain? Babloo's life story. - What! Your channel's TRP booster. Kamya, democracy doesn't mean that any.. Actually, just forget it. You know, I lost a soldier today. That too, not because of any battle or mission. I lost him here, in our capital. Lutyens' Delhi. That soldier asked me before leaving.. 'Sir, what are you leaving behind' 'for this new generation?' Believe me. I had no answer. Anyway, see you. - Bye. 'Baburao, say everything.' Just assume that the entire world is listening to you. Really? Sir, there is a plot in Colaba, Mumbai right in front of Sea Castle. I used to work there. There was a dog out there, it was always sick. I don't like dogs. My interest lies in race course. My wife left me because of that. 'The race is on..' - Come on. Come on.. Come on! Place your bets! Place your bets. - Come on! It's very difficult to curb your habit. Whether it's a good one or a bad one it definitely tests you. On a derby day I borrowed Rs. 500 from someone and was about to leave for Mahalaxmi. But that dog's condition was critical on that day. He was about to die. Something happened to me. I don't like dogs. I had only Rs. 500. But I decided that I would spend that money on the dog's treatment. I took him to a veterinary doctor. He administered two injections and told me that I brought the dog on time. The dog survived. He prescribed few medicines and discharged him. I paid him Rs. 400. I was left with Rs. 100. I dropped the dog off at the flat and went to Mahalaxmi. Rs. 100 on Born free. Rs. 100 on Born free! Well done.. Sir, you won't believe it. I won the derby by betting just Rs. 100. Lord.. I won! I won.. I named the dog Babloo. I was convinced! That day, I won the race because of him. Then I started taking care of the nearby stray dogs. Doing that made me feel good. Sir, you won't believe, I somehow used to win those racecourse events. I was certain that God chose me as a medium to take care of the dogs. That's when they started working on the plot. Permission was granted to build a six-storeyed building. It was being built to accommodate the widows of the martyrs. Me and my dogs stayed in the first plot. Then a few big cars started showing up daily. More storeys were added eventually. Seven storeys, eight and so on.. More people started showing up. And more storeys were added to it. From 6 storeys to 31 storeys! There was something fishy but I chose not to act on it. One day, when I was feeding the dogs an Army officer arrived in a luxury car. He started cursing in English upon seeing the dogs. He told his guards to throw me and my dogs out. Come on, man! My dogs didn't bite him. He should mind his own business. I thought like that. Then, his men.. My poor dogs.. Those men started beating my dogs. They even drove me out of the premises. One shouldn't mess around with a poor man. I took my pet dogs and moved to a new location. Then, I started to expose them. I said that something fishy is going on in the building. In a city like Mumbai if you start a ruckus, people will gather. Even God was with me. His power was with me. I shouted at the top of my voice. I feared nothing as my livelihood was the racecourse. I shouted even louder. The media personnel arrived and they started taking photos of the construction. The TV channel guys called me up for an interview. Baburao, how are you? Don't forget to watch the TV in the evening. Just watch it. Baburao. Major Jai Bakshi. I was going for the interview when your chap Jai, came to me and alerted that my life was in danger. He asked me to move to Delhi with him if I wanted to stay alive. Sir, it is sad to see the building that was built for the wives of the martyrs going into their hands.. The politicians and their men.. During this issue my pet dogs got separated from me. I still regret that. Not a problem. You and your pet dogs will be united. Where is Babloo? What will happen now, sir? Now, Babloo will topple the government, Baburao. Abhay. - Yes. It's me. 'There is a plot in Mumbai.. Sea Castle building in Colaba.' 'I used to work there.' 'Construction started at that plot.' 'Permission was granted to build a six-storeyed building.' 'for the widows of the martyrs.' 'Then, a lot of official cars started coming there.' 'More storeys were added eventually.' 'Seven floors, eight and so on..' 'More army cars started coming..' 'There were more than six floors..' 'Then, one day, my pet dogs..' Attention! Guns upright! 'The secret behind a building under construction' 'in Colaba, Mumbai has been exposed.' 'It is believed that the permission was given' 'for construction of a six-storeyed building.' 'But without any permission or official approval' 'the construction of the building was extended to 31 storeys.' 'The builders can't furnish any paperwork' - Thank you. 'They consider this as legal.' 'Upon learning about this news..' 'It's believed' 'that the building was constructed for defence officers.' 'But many VIP's have bought flats in this building.' 'How did a six-storey building' 'develop into a 31-storey building without any approval?' Look over there. No superior has received any kind of favour.. Is it the army or the ministers who'd be benefited by this scam? Of course, they will be benefited. The ministers.. - Sir, can you give an official statement? Look, we are talking to the army chief. - Sir, would you seek help from the CBI for the investigation? Yes, Roger. Sir, he is walking towards our building. Roger, keep watching. - Sir. Keep watching closely, Roger. Sir, he stopped. And? 'There are two ways.' 'How do you decide' 'whether you have to go left or right?' 'I toss for it.' Sir, he is.. He is doing something with a coin. A coin? 'When the coin is in the air' 'a moment comes when you become absolutely clear..' 'What is it that you really want?' Sir! Sir, he vanished. What! Of course. Maya, it's too late. - Yes. Sir, tea or coffee for you? It's very late. I forgot to tell you people. You people may leave. Bye. Sir, are you sure? Yes. Good night.. Good night, sir. - Good night, sir. Bye.
