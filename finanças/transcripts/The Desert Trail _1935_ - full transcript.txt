How many? Three. Just a minute! You're terrible. If you try any of those phoney tricks around snakegulch they'll run you out quicker than they did in the last place. I didn't get US run out of the last place. It was your fault. If you hadn't got mixed up with that dance hall girl we'd of still been there. I got mixed up with her? You forget, my boy, that it was you with the young lady when the vigilantes asked US to leave town. Then we oughta stay away from 'em. But chasin' after every good lookin' dame you see ain't gonna get you anyplace. Time we cut it out and try to make something of ourselves. That's the first sensible thing you ever said. The thing for you to do is to ignore them. But how can I? Ever since I've been able to tip my hat, women have had a weakness for me. Well, don't tip your hat. Don't even talk to them. Say, that's an idea. It's talk that always gets you into trouble with a woman. They always think you mean more than you say. Why, all you gotta do is say good morning, and they think you want to get hitched. From now on, I'm deaf and dumb to all them. Now you're talkin'. That's a great idea! You'll save me a lot of trouble if you really mean it. Absolutely. Whoa! Anything for rattlesnake gulch? Yep, a passenger and some mail. Oh, boy, take a look at that! I gotta do somethin' about that! I thought you said you were deaf and dumb to all of 'em! That's the trouble with you, Kansas, you haven't any will power! What do ya mean no will power? When I say a thing, I mean it! But you just said you were deaf and dumb as far as women were concerned. That's right. And it still holds good. Good. Will you allow me? Definitely. Thank you. Carry on! I'm John Scott. Headin' for the rodeo at rattlesnake gulch. ( Spanish accent ) Oh, how do you do? I am juanita hibero. My home is there. Oh, well that's great! Maybe I'll be able to see a lot of you while I'm there. Are you a rodeo star? Well not exactly, although I did pick up some money at the Cheyenne and Pendleton shows this year. Your friend here, is he a rodeo star? Him? A rodeo star? I should say not. That's Kansas Charlie. He's my, um... He's my ward. He's a poor, deaf and dumb guy. I just carry him along to take care of my saddles and stuff. Oh, that is too bad. How did it happen? Why, uh, he was scalped by Indians when he was a baby. He never regained his power and speech. Wait'll he takes his hat off. He's bald as a goat. See the poor fella's tryin' to talk. But that's the best he can do. Well, woman or no woman, I'm not gonna sit here and let you insult me like that! I am not bald headed! It's only a high forehead. See... Well, well, it's a positive miracle! They always told me that a sudden shock would restore his speech. But I didn't think he'd turn out to be half-witted! Now, that's the first forehead I ever saw that ran clear to the back of the neck. Why, you...!! Ow, oh! Careful Kansas! There's a lady present. You see, miss, he's practically a nitwit. Nitwit! Say, I got more brains than this fella will ever have! Now, what you need is a man to protect you. Somebody that's going to get ahead in the world. Ah, you've got too much class for these small town fellas. You need a man that's been around -- oh, thanks, Kansas, for the build-up. I think you're putting it a little strong. I'd rather the young lady found out a few things for herself. I wasn't talking about you! I was referring to myself! Modest, isn't he? A regular shrinking Violet. So, if you are all these things, you must be very rich... Oh, yes, yes, fairly rolling in wealth. Eh, most of the time. Of course, I don't carry it with me while I'm traveling. But there's plenty of money waiting for me at the rattlesnake gulch casino. Now, if you want to play a sure thing, juanita, stay away from this guy, and make a bet on me. You'll wear diamonds. Oh, that would be very nice... I should say it would. Oh, this is my house. This is where I get off. I will see both of you while you are here? I'll say you will! I'll say you will! Giddyup! ( Crowd cheering ) Announcer: John Scott up next! Coming! All right. Go on. Be a sap. When that horse gets through with you and you're layin' in a hospital bed tonight, I'll be out with juanita. Well, you may be out, Kansas, but not with juanita. I think you better stick to your gambling. When I come out of here a hero of this rodeo with all that prize money, you won't stand a chance! ( Crowd cheering ) Bettin' two. I'll call it. I'll stay. I'm in. Hello, boys. All: Hello, Kansas. Hey, what's the matter, boys? Why all the penny ante? You'd be playing them close to your chest too, if you got mixed up in this chiselin' rodeo outfit. I had to settle for twenty-five cents on the dollar, my award money. That's right. I got $82.50 for the $350.00 I had comin'. And those boys out there in that bulldoggin' contest will be lucky if they get anything. Oh, is that so? I'll be back in a minute, boys. ( Crowd noise ) So they cleaned you out already, and you're comin' back to me for money. Now, wait a minute. Ah, well you don't get it. I need all my dough for that date with juanita tonight. Now, this is serious. I'm not cleaned, but you are. Some of the boys were tellin' me they're paying off the prize money two bits on the dollar. And some of the guys that come in late ain't gonna' get any. That means you, pal. Oh, is that so? We'll just see about that right now. What's the matter, getting cold feet? With all that money waiting in the till... No, I'm all right. We'll wait till they come out. I got $900.00 in prize money comin', Farnsworth. I'll collect it right now. I ain't denying the money's due to you Scott, but this show is breaking mighty tough for US. It ain't payin' out like we expected, so we're giving the boys twenty-five cents on the dollar. Not me you aren't. You'll make it a hundred percent. Nine hundred dollars? I should say not! I'll give you $250 and not a cent more. It's $900 Farnsworth, no less. Now, don't try to get tough with me, Scott! I'm stretchin' it to even give you $250. You'd better take it, or you'll have to go without a cent. It's still $900. Kansas, count $900 out of that money in the safe, and we'll get out of here. Don't come out 'til you hear our horses leave! Get away from that phone! Get behind the counter and shell out those receipts! Come on! Give me that money! ( Bang! ) That sounded like it was rodeo's office! Come on, fellas! You keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking! Oh! The safe's open! Yeah! Farnsworth! He's been shot! What happened? Believe me. I saw Scott and Kansas Charlie, the gambler, coming out the office right after shots were fired! They must be the ones who did it! Yeah! You take a look over at the gambling casino, and I'll have the boys get mounted! C'mon, boys. What are you gettin' all slicked up for? I got a date with juanita. Too bad you ain't gonna be able to keep it! Yeah, who says I ain't? I do. Ah...do you think she'd have anything to do with a sheep herder like you? With a man of the world like me to be had? Just the same, you aren't going to keep that date. Hey, who's gonna stop me? I am! Why you -- ooh! Ow! Ho ho! They ain't over at the casino, sheriff! All right, boys! Let's go down to the shack! As I said before, it's too bad you can't keep that date tonight. Why, you!! But I'll give her a little chubby for you, Kansas. Well... Here's one of 'em already tied up for US. But I tell ya, sheriff, I didn't do it! I'd make mine too easy at the gambling table without going in for murder. Well, that's what you say. Maybe we can try him this afternoon and hang him right away and save the county the expense of feeding him. Sheriff, you can do one thing for me, will ya? What's that? Take my bank roll and my watch and give 'em to juanita. Well, I reckon we can do that all right. Put him on a horse, boys. Just a minute, sheriff! Drop those guns! Now, throw down that roll and watch. Now, just start out and keep goin'. Gettin' scared? You don't think I'd tell the sheriff that you was the one that done the shooting. We're pals. We got to stick together, kid, huh? Fact is, I'm going right along with you when you go to poker city tonight. Listen, Pete. I'm only goin' over there to lay low for awhile at my sister's place. Well, I'm going right along. Don't you think I know that some of the greatest shipments of gold go out on that poker city stage? I'm not interested in that. Well, you're gonna be if you want me to keep my mouth shut! I'll meet you at my shack tonight. Gonna say good-bye to my lady friend. You know, Pete, I think you are the sweetest man in all the world. Yeah? ( Gasp ) It is John Scott. He would not like to find you here! Get in the closet! Pronto! ( Knocking ) Oh, se√±or, como estas. Hello, juanita. Say, whose horse is that out there? Oh, it is mine. A friend just gave him to me. Oh... Well, I've got something better than that for you, baby. Just feast your eyes on this. Oh, it is beautiful! It's wonderful! But I cannot take it. No? No. All right. I'll keep it then. John, why haven't you come around to see me? I miss you so much, and I'm so lonesome for you. Oh, now, listen, baby, you just get yourself all dolled up, and we'll go out and buy you a real present. You know, if you coach me a little, then I can take the wash too. John, you know I think you're the sweetest boy in all the world. Ah, fine pal you are! As soon as my hands are tied, you try to steal my girl! What's the matter, Kansas, didn't the rope necktie fit? You're a brave guy as long as my hands are tied! Oh, yeah? Say, what so you mean by breakin' in on a lady's privacy like this? Privacy? Yes! Untie his hands, juanita, and I'll teach him a few lessons in manners. Why, you!! Ow! Oh! Ah! Wait! Your watch. Yeah, and how 'bout my bank roll? Oh, I almost forgot about it. It's a good thing you gave that back to me. I might've knocked you cold! Oh, my poor Kansas. Are you hurt? Hurt? I should say not. Maybe I'd better count it too. Maybe I'd better take charge of that roll. You boys are not and if either of you have any doubt aboutonon who's the best man here, ask juanita. Come on. Get in that closet. Get movin'! Now you have the money, you will take juanita with you to poker city, no? No... Is right. Did you hear what he said? He's headin' for poker city. Oh, you won't leave juanita. Ah, you sure made a mess of things. What do you mean the mess I made of things? I was doin' all right 'til you came along. Oh, is that so? She was only consolin' herself with you. Notice how she headed straight for me as soon as she found out I was a live. That's what you think. And it it hadn't of been for you, we wouldn't have lost the money! Oh, yeah! And if you hadn't come here, he wouldn't have got the money! I oughta smack you in the jaw for that! Well, I'd like to see you try it! Thanks. I will! Ow! Oh oh! I wouldn't want to steal you away from them. Adios. ( Yelling in Spanish ) Take that! Oh, you big steer! You ruin my clothes! Get out both of you! I don't want to see you anymore! Get out! Oh, juanita! No, I'll go to poker city with Pete! I hate you! Get out! ( Yelling in Spanish ) It's the sheriff. Let's get out of here! ( Gunfire ) Wait a minute, boys! Looks like they've given US the slip. Nope. No use trailin' them any further. Let's go back to juanita's and question her. Come on. Whew! Boy, I sure got US out of that scrape, didn't I, boy! I'll say you did! And now that you've got US out of it, I think we'd better split up. I'm goin' to poker city and get that guy Pete and my bank roll. No use you headin' for poker city. I'll take care of Pete myself. But I'll travel in style on the stage. Why, you sap, they'll get ya for sure! Who me? Not the reverend Smith, my boy... They will never question a doctor of divinity. ( Chuckling ) Well, so long, Moses. And I hope you get out of the wilderness. Ah, a noble defender of the law. Well, it's a nice enterprising little city you have here, sheriff. Yes, it is. I don't believe I got your name. Oh, pardon me, sheriff. I'm the reverend Harry Smith from rattlesnake gulch. Oh, I'm pleased to meet you, parson Smith. Plan on stayin' here long? Well, yes... That is if the climate agrees with me. You see, sheriff, i, uh... I had a little recent throat trouble. I have to be real careful of my health. Yes. I reckon a change of climate is healthy now and then. What do you plan to do here, parson? Well, I kinda thought that maybe i'd, uh... Well, well. One of my old congregation. You remember me, don't you, Jim? I'm the reverend Smith. Yeah, how are ya, parson? Oh, I'm always glad to see one of my old friends. Ah, looks like we're gonna have a new parson, boys. Yeah. Who's the dame? Huh? Oh, yeah. Anne, I want you to meet our preacher from rattlesnake gulch. How do you do? I'm pleased to meet you, Dr. Smith. I'm so glad to know that Jim associated with good companions during his stay in rattlesnake gulch. Oh, yes, yes. Jim was a regular member of my congregation. As a matter of fact, he was one of my greatest contributors. Oh, it's so nice to know that. You see, Jim and I are orphans. He's all the family I have. I'll keep an eye on him, miss Anne. The fact is, I was hoping to get some of the boys together for a little prayer meeting tonight. And I would like to have Jim attend some of the, uh... Sessions. How 'bout it, Jim? Thanks, parson. A lone gunman robbed the stage this morning. That's the fourth time this month. We gotta do somethin' about it. What's he look like? I didn't get a very good look at him. There's too many strangers around these parts. It's time we investigated some of them. There's one of 'em now. Hey, you! Me? Yes, you. What's your name? John Jones. There's gettin' to be too many joneses and smiths around here to suit me. You better come on over to my office. I want to ask you a few questions. Oh, now, wait a minute, sheriff. You can't put me in jail yet! I just got in town. Now, don't try to be funny. Is this the fella that held up the stage? Well, I can't rightly identify him. You see, I didn't get a very good look at him. Sure, sheriff, you've got the wrong man -- there's a fellow that knows me. Hey, son. C'mere a minute. You remember John Jones, don't you Jim? Yes. Oh, sure, Jim's an old friend of mine from rattlesnake gulch. I just came over to pay him a visit. How are ya, Jim? Well, be seeing you, sheriff. Sure is good to see you again, Jim. You kinda took me by surprise. I didn't expect to see you here. I gotta be goin'. I'll see ya later, Scott. Anne, I won't be home until late. That's all right, Jim. Mr. Smith will see me home. All right. Thanks a lot, miss, but the name is Jones. I said Smith. If you pardon me, I'm going to lock up, Mr. Jones. I'm waiting for Mr. Smith. In that case, I guess we'll both wait for him. Well, you needn't trouble. Oh, it's no trouble. I don't have anything else to do. Couldn't you find some other place to do it? Well, I could, but... You wouldn't be there. Is there anything you want? Sure... What's in those bottles? Nerve tonic, but you don't need any. No, but my horse does. He's all run down. I think I'll take one. Is there anything else? Well, let me see now... Well, well, well, just what I've been looking for. Do you think they'll fit? Well, I'm sure I don't know! Well, I guess there's only one way to find out. I hope that's all. Come to think about it, uh... I think I'll take another bottle of that nerve tonic. My horse is pretty well run down. Shall we dance? I'm so glad to see you, parson Smith. Well, I'm right on time. You couldn't have come any too soon to suit me. Well, if I thought it meant that much to you, I could've been here long before this. Well, well, well... So this is the parson Smith. Jones is my name, doctor, how do you do? Haven't I seen you someplace before? It was at a party. A farewell party? You were going away. But come now, doctor, what can we do for you? I have it... How about a necktie? It would look very becoming with that outfit. Will you stop this nonsense so we can pick these things up and close the store? Oh, are we ready to go? Just where do you think you're going, Mr. Jones? Oh, you can come along, Mr. Smith, that is, if the young lady doesn't mind. I wish I had your nerve, Mr. Jones. That's easy. Why, you!! Don't say it! Wait a minute. If it's going to cause all this trouble, you both can take me home. I'm telling you Pete, I don't like the looks of things. It was bad enough when Kansas Charlie showed up, but now John Scott's here. They must know somethin'. We gotta quit this racket. So they followed US. You forget, they're still wanted for the murder of Farnsworth. And if I should tell them that you done it -- you wouldn't do that, Pete! No, not as long as we're still partners. When does that next gold shipment go out? Saturday. Meet you here Saturday. Don't tell me you're back for more nerve tonic. You were in here five times yesterday and three times the day before, and you've just about cleaned me out. Perhaps you'd better try soothing syrup for a change. No thanks. I think I'll leave that to parson Smith. As a matter of fact, I came in here looking for him. Good morning, Dr. Smith. I was just looking for you. Yeah? Looks like it. No. This is on the level. I've got to talk to you. Will you pardon US, Anne? Certainly. Listen, I just saw Jim ridin' out to the desert trail with a man that looked like Pete. I figure if we take a ride out that way, we might get our dough back. Hey, is this the straight goods? Absolutely. All right. Let's go then. Now, let's get this straight. I'll cover the stage from here, you go in and clean out the passengers. Then you tie 'em up and get the strong box. All right? Heeyah! ( Gunfire ) Get moving! Somebody coming! You chase after them. I'll stop the coach. You stay up here. I'll meet you in town. Whew... Well, young man. You sure saved our lives. Did they get anything? Yes. My watch and money. Well, that's too bad. I'll drive you on into town. Heeyah! ( Bang! ) Why, Jim! I didn't think you'd get mixed up in a thing like this! Pete made me do it. And he made me take the stuff. Ah, Pete, eh? So this is his stuff? Please don't tell Anne. No, I won't tell her. You helped me out of a little jam with the sheriff when I landed here. Besides, Pete's the man I'm after. Maybe this'll kinda even things up. You tell Pete we'll just call that interest. And if you want my advice, you'll stay away from Pete, or you'll find yourself dangling on the wrong end of a rope some day. Thanks, Kansas, for lettin' me go. Ah, don't thank me. Thank your sister. Whoa! What happened, stranger? Take care of the driver. Sheriff, we certainly owe that young man a vote of thanks. He drove off the bandits. I'm sorry. I was wrong about you, Jones. Oh, that's all right, sheriff. Well, folks, we certainly took care of that situation. Wait a minute, sheriff. These men are wanted for murder over at rattlesnake gulch. He killed Farnsworth, held up the stage, and now tryin' to pass themselves off as heroes. I don't believe it. Sheriff, my watch and chain. You're under arrest! I wasn't so wrong after all. Lock 'em up, boys. What do ya think of that, huh? I'll notify the sheriff at rattlesnake gulch. Yeah, I would if I were you, sheriff. Now, look at the jam you got US into. I got US into? Where'd you get that watch? I took it off of Jim. He and Pete pulled that holdup. I turned him loose. Oh, big-hearted, Charlie. You turned him loose and landed US right in jail. I landed US in jail? Say, smart guy, why did you bring that stage into town? But I didn't steal the stage... It's just a little matter of property rights that you wouldn't understand. Oh, I wouldn't understand... Do you mean to insinuate that I'm dumb? No. Dumber!! Why, you!! Ow! Oh! Aah! What's the matter, sis? Sheriff arrested John and Kansas today for stage robbery and murder, and they're talking about hanging them. I don't believe they had anything to do with it. I'm sure they didn't. But how are we going to prove it? You're mighty fond of one of them, aren't you? Don't you worry, sis. You go on home and get some sleep. I'll close the store for you. All right, Jim. I'll be home later. All right. Look! She sure is a swell girl. I knew she wouldn't let me down. Shut up and give me those saw blades. We got plenty to do before morning. Good morning, miss Anne. Good morning, sheriff. I wonder if it would be all right if I came over a little later to talk to John and Kansas. Oh, that'd be all right. We were just taking them over some breakfast. Thanks. I have to go to the store, but I'll be right back. There's a couple of horses at the other end of the street. Now, take it easy, and they'll never suspect US. Why, they're gone! What happened? John and Kansas broke jail. The whole town's shootin' at 'em. Now's our chance to stick up the bank, make a final haul and get out of here! Not me. I'm through. I'm gonna tell the sheriff! That you killed Farnsworth? Yes, and I held up the stage. Wait, you fool! Oh!! Jim! Pete just shot Jim! Easy, sis. They'll think we did it. We gotta get out of here! The colonel's out of the way. Let's rush 'em. Careful, boys. They may be in the back room. There's Pete. We've gotta get him and make him talk! It's our only chance. Sheriff! Sheriff! They held up the bank. They took the road to the river. Let's get mounted, boys. You draw his fire from the front while I get around back. The sheriff and the posse's coming. I'll hold 'em off. You see if you can bring Pete to and make him talk. What happened, sis? Did John and Kansas get to the river shack? They got away. The sheriff and posse were after them. You gotta stop them. John and Kansas are innocent. I...shot Farnsworth. Pete framed it all. He made me help him hold up the stage. When he wanted me to Rob the bank, I told him I was through. I was goin' for the sheriff when he shot me. Ted, come with me. What did you want to hit him so hard for? If I do bring him to, he won't be able to talk. Sheriff! Jim just told me that he and Pete held up the stage. Pete framed the whole thing. John and Kansas are innocent. That's right, sheriff. I heard the confession. It was Pete who robbed the bank too. Stop firing, boys. Tommy, you come with US. They've quit firing. Probably gettin' ready to rush US. Well, we're all out of ammunition. That means we'll have to give ourselves up. Oh, if I could only make this guy talk! It's Anne with the sheriff. Let 'em in. All right, sheriff. We give up. I'm sorry, boys. I made a mistake. Jim has confessed. All right, men, bring him out. Well, I gotta be gettin' back to juanita, so I'll have to rush this. Do you, Anne, take this man, John, to be your lawful wedded husband? I do. And do you, John... Get outta here. I want this thing to be legal. Captioned by captioneering your closed captioning resource
