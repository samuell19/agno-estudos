For you. Thanks. For you. Thanks. The chocolate... Mitan is a crybaby girl who is thoughtful of her friends. She was always crying loudly. Mitan, you okay? Mitan. What a great scene. Your back zipper is open, better go fix it. Oh no. Excuse me for a moment. Long time no see! Likewise. I heard that Matsuo-kun is a doctor and Nara-kun is a lawyer now. You've been glowing since high school! Look at you, Tanaka-san, still as beautiful as ever. Oh, thanks! To be honest I'm totally OK with anyone as long as he is healthy and not cheating! But I still care about income. Well, I think it'd be better to have a good amount of savings. I'll... go get a drink. Me too. Champagne, please. Champagne? Yep. Rika-san will resort to any means to reach her goals. A femme fatale. With such a fierce passion, she didn't let her prey escape. Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Watch out! Sorry, you okay? I'm so sorry! I'm fine. I truly sorry! Don't worry! Good luck with the match, Hamasaka-kun. Thanks. Do your best. Sorry again! I'm rooting for you! Yuko, will you stop hitting on Hamasaka-kun? No, I'm not... You have a bad reputation. Do you know that you're rumored as the man-eater, I wonder? Thanks for the concern, you're very kind. Yuko-chan is a high school senior who is always full of smiles. The smile she put in vain gave her even more enemies. Just in time. Morimiya-san is an office worker who does not like competition. His character is serious and reserved. Morimiya-san, are you OK with this? He took the credit and even got promoted. That's OK. He still remembers it as if it were yesterday. The restlessness and despair he felt when he dropped the baton in his grade school's inter-class relay. AND SO, THE BATON IS PASSED And now, Morimiya Yuko-san, the chosen piano player for the graduation choir. Share your thought, please. Hold on a minute. Morimiya-san took piano lessons for only a few years, right? Even though we have 3 applicants for the music college? But it would be a pity if they waste time with choir practice before the entrance exam. Even Yuko is pleased to. I'll do my best! As a father, I'm proud of you being the piano player for the graduation choir. Yuko-chan, you're reliable. I wouldn't say so. The analogy would be like... When you're forced to be the president of a neighborhood association that nobody wanted to. Another modest analogy of yours again. The graduation choir is the last main event in high school, you know? Should I buy you piano for this occasion? No need, this is good enough. Let me spoil you once in a while, I'm your father. Anyways, Morimiya-san. I've told you many times. Can you please stop making me character bento? But a bento is the best canvas to express a parent's love, don't you think? "Parents' Day / Class Observation" Say, Papa. Why am I the only one without Mama? Mitan, you have Mama too. Where is she? She's up in the sky. She was a very sweet Mama. Mitan? I made the best double-cooked pork today. Morimiya-san, aren't you cooking too much? It's parents' responsibility to nourish their children. You'll end up eating everything, won't you? It's bad to waste food so I have no choice. I can't lose weight thanks to you. Are you concerned about the way boys look at you? Morimiya-san, why don't you remarry? That's because until I send you off to marriage, I have to fulfill my duty as a father. You're not popular, I guess. Hey, I'm popular. You don't know how troubled I am when turning down an invitation. Then I should get married as soon as I graduate so you can remarry in peace. What? Let's eat! So pretty! Awesome! Did you like it? Who are you? I'm Rika-san, your Papa's friend. She's helping me make chocolates at the company. She also supports my dream. Nice to meet you. I'm dressed now. OK! It looks good on you! You'll even cuter when you smile. So cute! Nice! Perfect. Girls look 30% cuter when they smile. Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile. Mitan. Would you love to have Mama like me? Yeah! Then I'm going to be your Mama! What? Chocolate cake! This chocolate is made from special cacao beans carefully grown on a farm in Brazil. What made it special? Everyone, let's all wish Mitan a happy birthday! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Eat your fill! Your Mama is so cool, Mitan! Thank you. If there's anything you want, just tell me. I've already got everything. But I hope you have life insurance. Preferably a high-value one. I made parfaits too! I haven't decided on the graduation choir composition for each class, but I'd like to know everyone's level, so play each of your favorite composition. Let's start from Wakabayashi-san. What's wrong? I'm sorry, I got a bit nervous. Next will be Hayase-kun. Have a bite. I made your favorite cabbage rolls today. I also kept the portion minimum. Are you in love with someone? WHAT?! Then invite him here and I'll see if he's the right man for you. Morimiya-san, listen. I don't like it when you act like a father all the time. Because I am. That's the point. What point? There's always something off about you. No wonder Mama ran away. Do you have to open up my old wound right now? - Delicious. - Is it? Papa's not coming home. I told you he's on a business trip. He's working hard for you, Mitan. What about our promise of going to the beach? I've been waiting since forever! I've been waiting since forever. OK! How about we go now? Didn't you have a cold? Don't mind that! If I can have fun with you, I will be just fine! Come on, let's practice! Jump! I'm attacked! Look at that! A flower! Cool! Eat a lot! I want fries! Enjoy it. Yummy! I have good news for you today. What is it? I told you I dreamed of making my own chocolate, right? You did. You found the best cacao beans in Brazil, right? That's right. Brazil? Seen from Japan, it's a country right on the other side of the globe. On the other side! I decided to create my own chocolate there. There? You mean in Brazil? Yeah. What about your current company? I quit. Starting next month, the three of us will live together in Brazil! Did you... ...make the decision without consulting me? You said you'll support me, right? That's why... I don't want to go to Brazil! The climate and food don't suit me. I can't speak the language and I know nobody there! Isn't that where the power of family comes in? If it's a family that only imposes its own convenience, I don't mind it getting dissolved. Hey, be considerate when you speak in front of your child! I am being considerate! Look at Mitan. If she lives in a foreign country with different language and culture, I feel sorry for her! If you want to go, go by yourself. What are you saying? Who's gonna look after Mitan then? I'll take the responsibility to raise her in Japan. I'm her real parent. How cunning... Now you're talking like that. I'm her real mother now. Well, how about we let Mitan decide it? What? Is Brazil really that far away? I never ever want to part ways with you, Mitan! Even I... ...don't want to leave you! Welcome back. You rarely stay up and wait for me coming home. Mitan has decided. She wants to stay with me here. How did you persuade her? Did you buy her expensive toys? Or did you dress her up at Disneyland? Don't be so rude. Even I'm a busy soul myself. I work every day. Take care of her homework. Make lunch boxes and meals. Your cooking is just warming up frozen food! We're completely done for. I'm sorry, Papa. I promised my friends. Do you really have to go to Brazil? Mitan. You don't have to apologize. Even if we are ever separated... I will always be your Papa! Why only Sonoda Women University? Because I can become a certified dietician. But with your grades, I can recommend you to a prestigious four-year school. I love cooking. I want to be out in the society and stand on my own as soon as possible. I wonder if it's a family problem. What? You don't really fit in with the class, do you? You always cover things up with smiles. If you're having a hard time, talk to your me... Sensei... Would you be satisfied if I cried over a painful memory? Thank you. What are you saying, Hayase-kun? Now when you've already been recommended to Tokyo College of Music, you want to go to a culinary school, are you serious? You've won numerous competitions, a pianist with a promising future. But I thought I could take different path. Such a path... I'm sure your mother wouldn't approve of it. I am not her possession. Hayase-kun. I do think you should go to the music college. I mean, your piano playing was so amazing! It was so amazing that it blew away all my frustrations. Frustations? You see, only I who couldn't play at all. Wasn't it embarrassing? No. You were the most comfortable with that piano. It felt gentle right from the first note. I liked that. The old house was more spacious and beautiful. It's only the two of us here, this is good enough. Mitan, you don't eat the Taiyaki? I don't want it. I'm writing a letter to Papa. Hey, Mitan! Shall we go to Disneyland tomorrow? I don't want to go. Oh no! This is bad! I miss Papa! Don't cry! It's times like this when you have to smile. I have to smile even if I'm not having fun? Smile, and it will attract all kinds of luck your way. We're not done talking! Promise me you'll enter the competition. That should be up to me, right? That competition has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. Don't impose such a thing on me. This is the score you dropped. Yuko, are you going for Hayase-kun now? You should be careful, Hayase-kun. She even made eyes at Hamasaka-kun the baseball player. She thinks she can get away with anything as long as she smiles. Thanks again for your concern. So annoying. What composition is that? Rossini. Best composition ever. He put a nice expression, right? Not only was he a musician, he also was a cook. I know about Rossini-style steak. The kind with foie gras and truffles on top. I'm an aspiring chef. If I add up both of us, we'd be Rossini! You're strong. What? You kept smiling when they're mean to you. It's better than being angry. You smile like you've practiced it over and over in front of the mirror. Oh no, did it show? You really practice that? Come to think of it, you never smile, Hayase-kun. While I was rebelling against my mother's words that I should express my emotions more because it was part of the performance, I forgot how to express myself. I'm jealous. Of what? I've never had an argument with my parents. You're real parent and child, so you can argue at ease. What? Well, we're a real parent and child, too, on the family register. In fact, Morimiya-san really cares about me. Morimiya-san? Are you saying that you're not blood related? Yeah. How nice. What? You respect each other, it's even better than being a real parent and child. It's here! The letter! Papa! Papa! Welcome back. I'm home. Mama, the mail came. Thanks. I'll put it there. Thanks. My latest letter... I asked you to send it, why it's still here? Sorry, I've been busy with part-time job. I'll send it out tomorrow! Okay? I write to him every week, I wonder if he receives my letter? He hasn't responded at all. It takes a long time to get there in Brazil. Grown-ups don't write letters that much. Anyways, Mitan. I have something for you! Look! So pretty! Look at this one too. I bought one as well! Is it okay? We don't have any more rice. So pretty! We're in a state of emergency! You want a new piano, after all. No, I'm just a bit curious. Isn't such restraint not very parent-child like? Morimiya-san, the piano I want isn't one of those cheap ones. You can't just buy it. We have to find a soundproofed house and move there. It's impossible, you know! Can you stop acting like a father all the time? B-because... I am. If you're a parent, it's OK to say no and scold me. But I'm weak at scolding. I got stomachache just for paying attention to you in the sixth grade. We can't even put up an argument after all. Is he your father, by any chance? Who is he? Hayase-kun, a schoolmate. He is a really great pianist. She told me about you. Yuko-chan told you about me? I'm surprised you don't have a piano in your house. It's amazing you can make that kind of sound. You really meant it. Yeah. Hayase, would you like to have dinner at our house? What? What? Why not? This is so delicious, father! I'm telling you. You have no right to call me father. The stems, cores, and skins of this vegetables soup. You make such a good dish using parts that are normally thrown away. It's my duty as a parent to make Yuko-chan happy. I told you to stop acting like a father all the time. Sometimes he makes me eat terrible food. Don't flatter him too much, Hayase-kun. Silently sharing a terrible food is one of the best parts in being parent-child, isn't it? Are you drinking alcohol-free drink? Yeah. Because if Yuko-chan gets sick, it'd be difficult to take her to the hospital. I've decided I'm not going to drink until she's 20. That's how I, as a man, raised her. What about your mother? She ran away. What? Why? That's a three-way problem. One, she hated me. Two, she found a better man. Three, she's on the run after committing a heinous crime. It could be any of them. Indeed. That's kinda nice. What is? I never have that kind of casual parent-child conversation. Are your parents strict? I want to leave home as soon as possible after graduation and start a family of my own right away. That means you're gonna get married, right? Yeah, I guess. Are you wishing for how many children you want? I'm an only child, so maybe three? Sounds nice! Looks lively and fun! I got free bread crust! This is our dinner? The magic tricks begin now! Enjoy! Let's eat. Delicious! Thank goodness! Have a bite, Mama. Mama, I found 50 yen! What? That's a lot of money! Wanna go all out? I think it means they wanna use the hot carpet that they don't regularly use to save money on electricity Hot carpet, switch on! OK, switching on! So warm! It doesn't heat up that fast. Alright, stick to me! OK! Say, Mama. How long will you live? Huh...? I don't have any siblings nor cousins, right? That's why, I want you to stay alive forever. Don't you worry. Mama is very strong! I'm glad. I love you so much! "Mama and Mitan" The graduation choir song for Class 3 is set to be "On the Day of Departure." Please listen to the accompaniment first. Wow, seriously? That sounds bad. Did you even practice? Hey, the rain's stopped now, why don't we play together? We haven't played at all lately. Sorry, I have piano lessons today. I see. How about you, Mina-chan? Sorry, I have piano lessons as well. Shall we go? Is your piano teacher nice? Yeah. What about yours? My teacher is scary when being angry. Let's go buy Papa's birthday present. OK! Be careful. I want to take piano lessons too. What? But we can't afford it, right? I understand. It's okay. I will do something. I will work hard. "Let's get married!" I didn't expect to meet such a beautiful lady! You seem to be aiming high. Not at all! Well, I'd like to have a house that is big enough for a piano. Another glass of champagne, please. Morimiya-kun, can you collect this proposal as well? Sure. Thanks. Hello? Morimiya-san, you have a visitor. Why is that beautiful woman visiting Morimiya-san? Isn't that suspicious? I have a favor to ask. You're the only one I can count on now. Well, can I ask you a favor too? Ask me anyting! Yuko-chan! You're so early. Yeah. Who else is coming? That's something you need to look forward to. Is it a woman, by any chance? Someone you'll be happy to meet with. Someone you'll definitely like. Happy birthday to you! I think you were deceived. There is no way you're popular. Say, have you ever heard of "politeness is not just for strangers"? But I'm kind of relieved. If you remarry that person, there will be no place for Mama to return. You want her to come back? I am such a terrible father. I haven't done anything for you. That's not true! You're doing your best in your own way. If that's your situation, I might be able to help. I've considered many things, and you're the only one I can count on. I will take care of everything for you. Thank you, Shige-chan. Where are we? Just follow me. A great thing is waiting for you! Really? A piano! From today on, this piano is yours! Come on, try playing it. Can I? What a nice sound. It's the sound of a new future. I see you liked it. Who is he? Izumigahara Shigeo-san, your new Papa! What? Please enjoy with a cup of tea. Thank you. It feels like Cinderella, doesn't it? I too am happy to be free from that apartment. Hey, Mama. Izumigahara-san is a lot older than you, but do you love him? Rather than love, he's not a bad guy. Plus he has a piano. You married him for the piano?! Thanks to you, I won't have to beg for the bread crust anymore. Now that you have a new Papa. And you still didn't get any replies. Can this be the last time you write to your old Papa? Amidst the white light The mountain range sprouts Towards the distant corner of the sky I'm sorry. I'll figure something out before the show. Well. It'll work itself out in the end, right? For now, why don't you try it again? Okay. We've heard a lot from the teacher. My family is messy too. You must have gone through a lot as well. The letters should be over here. Thanks. When the weather warms up, let's go to my villa in Karuizawa. It's like a dream. Can I have another bottle of champagne? Please enjoy the pâté with this wine. Start from the postlude. Postlude? Great. That was really good! I owe it all to you, for teaching me so much. You didn't smile when you were playing it. What? You looked all serious. Hayase-kun, you unusually smiled. Huh? Yuko, you didn't forget our promise, right? If we're intruding, nevermind then. No, I didn't forget it! I see you've made friends. We study for exams together in the library. Wait for me. This house is so cramped. Maybe it doesn't suit me. We've only just moved in here, you know. I feel like I'm suffocating here. Yuko-chan, I'm coming in. What is this? I have 15 million yen of savings. I'll use the money to buy you a piano and move into a soundproofed house. What? I'm just trying to figure out what I can do as a father. And this is the only thing I could think of. I don't need it. Our talk of piano for the graduation choir is over. Is it too late now? No, because I'm pursuing culinary career. I want to be someone who can make people happy with delicious food. Like you, Morimiya-san. What? No matter how bad things got, I always had you cooking for me at home. Eating it gave me comfort. I'm really thankful to you. Ah, I see. It was my influence, huh? I'm surprisingly a good father! "I won't be back for a while. Take care of Mitan. Rika" Don't worry. She'll be back soon. What if she doesn't come back? I'm your Papa now, Mitan. There's nothing to worry about. Yuko-chan, I'm coming in. Okay. Night meal for you. This much? Night meal to support studying for the exam is a show of parental love, isn't it? I'm gonna be sleepy if I'm too full. Did it bother you? But I can't resist the temptation. Thank you for the food! Study hard. I will. Thank you. Izumigahara-san, please come here. Look at her. What happened, Mitan? You don't even go to school. I don't want to go. If you're like that, Izumigahara-san can't go to work either. Come on, let's get out of here. Let her be. What matters now is how Mitan feels. When will Mama come home? Don't worry. She'll be back eventually. I miss Mama. I miss... Merry Christmas! Oh? A gathering? Are you waiting for me? What were you doing this past two months? Mitan! What were you doing? You know, I was on a farm in a highland with a beautiful view. I was allowed to live and work there. Anyway, the nature is nice and the air is clean. I'm gonna live there for a while. So you won't live here anymore? I'll be over here on the weekend. You know, we can commit to weekend marriage? Are you sure, Izumigahara-san? Well, you seem happier to have a job than doing nothing. It may be the right sense of distance. I knew Shige-chan would understand! Thank you. Your gifts! Say, Mama. There was Parents Day at school. I was lonely without you. I'm sorry, Mitan. But I still feel suffocated in this house. I'm gonna do something about it. What do you mean? Hey, don't you think I've lost weight? I'm on diet and trying to find a new boyfriend! Yuko! Congrats on passing the exam! Thanks! Starting April, Fumina will be in Hokkaido and I will be in Kyoto. You'll remain in Tokyo. It'll be lonely. We're just getting to know each other. Don't worry. I'll be back for summer vacation and we can chat on LINE. You're right. By the way. I heard Hayase-kun got accepted to Tokyo College of Music. He did? I'm happy for him. He must play the piano, after all. I agree. Can you wrap it as a gift? Gift for passing the exam. Would you like to put a ribbon? Yes, please. Please wait. You look happy. Morimiya-san, you followed me here? Because it's our first date in a while. Thanks for waiting. Cafe au lait or cappuccino? Cappuccino. Cappuccino? This is it. For you. Just basic gift, a wristwatch. Can I open it? Is this my gift for passing the exam? Well, it contains my gratitude feelings for all you've done and for the moments that will be carved form now on. It's the one I wanted! I'm so happy! Thank you! Congratulations. I have something for you as well. I'm the one who should be thanking you, Morimiya-san. What is this? The tableware set that you wished for. No way! Can I take this? Thank you so much for everything. I'll be fine now. What do you mean? I'm thinking of living on my own with a part-time job after graduation. Yuko-san, you'll be moving out? I can't bother you any further. Didn't I tell you? That I will fulfill my duty as a father until you get married. Well, you still can do that even if we live separately. But whom will I use this tableware set with if you're gone? I hope you'll use it with your new wife. If you had someone to marry when I get married, it would double the joy, wouldn't it? It could be. What an amazing play. Can I check it? Of course. Amazing! I didn't know you're getting this good! I'll play at the upcoming recital! I even got a dress! Listen, I have good news too. I got a man from UTokyo! I shouldn't abandon reunions. Mito-san had a dream. Izumigahara-san had money. The next must be intellect! Are you going to get married again? I've already arranged the wedding. But Izumigahara-san has taken good care of me. I'm even having a recital. If you choose piano over me, so be it. You have the right to choose. But... I am your mother, you know. You're cunning, Mama. I can't live without you. Thank you my dear! No need to worry about me. You can do anything you want. If you'd like to play the piano, come anytime. Thank you. Is everything OK? About what? You haven't touched your food. Graduation ceremony is coming up, and all you do is play the piano. I'll be your rehearsal partner. What? I will sing along with your performance. You can sing? Flawlessly! The graduation choir in my high school sang the same song back in the day. Let's try it. Come on! Try playing it. Go. I'll sing along. Amidst the white light The mountain range sprouts Towards the distant corner of the sky You start flying The endless blue sky moved your heart To the birds dashing towards freedom without looking back Gather your courage onto your wings And ride the wind of hope Entrust your dreams To the vast sky Are you Morimiya-san? Yes, I am. Who are you? I'm Mitan. Mitan? It's her nickname for always crying out loud. But you're already in 4th grade, shall we graduate from Mitan? You are Morimiya Yuko from today on! What do you mean, "Morimiya Yuko"? She is Yuko, my daughter! Wh- you have a child?! Didn't I tell you? You didn't. Sorry, I thought I've told you. What will you do? There's still time to run away. I'm sorry, Morimiya-san. It's my fault. Don't say that. It's not your fault. I'm just surprised, that's all. I mean, it's amazing. Being able to live with you is already my utmost happiness, and on top of that, I'll be living with an adorable daughter as well. Thanks to you, I'll have twice as much delight in the future. Thank you! Tomorrow, we'll be together. Together. Together. I suddenly recall The nostalgic voices of my friends The times I cried because of our meaningless squabbles The day we embraced each other in heartfelt joy Those days are gone But I'll hold tightly on to those memories Gather your courage onto your wings And ride the wind of hope Entrust your dreams To the vast sky Don't cry. Now is the time to part Smile, and it will attract all kinds of luck your way. Believe in the future you're taking off to Believe in the power of youth In this vast, boundless sky Now is the time to part Believe in the future you're taking off to Believe in the power of youth In this vast Boundless sky Yuko-chan, what's the third subject? After college enrollment, Yuko-chan who began living on her own while working part-time landed a job at a prestigious restaurant after obtaining numerous certifications. But she resigned because she wasn't comfortable with the rigidity of tradition and formalities. She spent agonizing days not knowing which path to choose. "Come over for dinner once in a while." "You're always welcome here." In the end, she eventually decided to work at Kitchen Yoshida, where she had a part-time job back in her college days. Yuko-chan, here. Okay. Here is your order. Thank you. I'm off for delivery! Kento, wait! We need to talk! What is there to say? Wait! I said wait! Excuse me. I'm from Kitchen Yoshida, the restaurant you ordered from... Welcome back. I quit the music college. It led to our huge dispute. Why did you quit? I just couldn't adapt. I must dedicate to music with all serious look. People's worth is decided based on their performance in the competition. I wanted to enjoy eating and living like Rossini. I also have culinary training in Italy and I plan to study in France. I'm struggling to become a chef just like you. Won't you play the piano anymore? I can live without piano. What's wrong? Can I ask you something? You said you wanted to start a family as soon as you graduated. Did you get married? Nah. She was so done with my bullshit so she left me. I see you were dumped. Huh? You look kinda happy. Did I look like that? I've never seen you smile so naturally. To celebrate our reunion, let's shake hands for now. Do you... ...have feelings for me? Well... Yes. I do. Long before I entered high school, I admired your piano playing. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Forget it. I, too, want to know you more. Because I sometimes think about you. Had you told me, I would've prepared more for you. I'm gonna make something delicious! Can I help you there? Sure. I'll borrow your apron. Delicious! Cheers! So good! Alright. Let's eat! The tableware set you gave me finally saw the light of day. It's very nice as I thought. It really makes the dish stand out. Does it taste weird? It's a very comforting taste. To me, it tastes a whole lot better than a first class restaurant. The roots of cuisine that I aspire to acquire might be right here. Whoa! I'm delighted. I'm glad I took a cooking class. Cooking class? Before we got married, she said that she wasn't good at housework and unilaterally put me in charge of cooking. Say. Why did you and Mama get married? You want me to tell it now? I've always been wondering. A deeply sincere man and a haphazard woman. It can't be a good match, can it? It was Rika who wooed me. At a high school reunion that I attended out of duty, I didn't have anyone to talk to. And when I was thinking to leave... I knew it's you, Morimiya-kun! So happy to meet you. Tanaka Rika-san? I heard you graduated from UTokyo and joined Mitsumaru Shoji? I knew you're amazing! "I knew"? Don't you remember standing next to me in the graduation choir? I was unilaterally thinking. That if I were to marry someone, it would be a man like you. M-marry? But do you have any savings? Well, I do. Do you like kids? Yeah, I secretly dream to have a drink with one of my own kids someday. That'd be awesome! I got overly excited I guess. I finally realized it when she told me about you right before the wedding. Rika wasn't looking for a marriage partner, but a father for you. I'm amazed you accepted us. Because Rika was my first love. And with you, I can get closer to my secret dream of having a drink with my own kid. And we're doing it right now! Has she ever contacted you? Well, she's a wanderer and haphazard woman, after all. I won't be like that. This is your home, Yuko-chan. Come anytime. I'm never moving out. By the way. I have something to tell you about. I have a bad feeling about this. You have a boyfriend? I want to get married. What? G-get married? Isn't that the main event of a father? Do you think it's too soon? Well, I won't doubt the man you chose. As a father who is understanding, I can can only congratulate you. Thank you. What is he like? He is someone you know. Hayase-kun. What? You mean, him? Yes. Isn't he still in college? No, he quit the music college. Huh? Now we're trying to open a restaurant together. And he's been traveling overseas for culinary training. I can't approve of him. You'll be only pushed around by such a wanderer. No, he is earnest. Absolutely not. In the first place, do his parents approve of your marriage? No... He currently estranged from his parents. That's not worth considering. Did you just say marriage? Yes. We are thinking of opening a restaurant together. Was it you who made him abandon the piano? No. Hayase-kun chose to pursue a career in the culinary arts by his own will. Have you ever tried his cooking? Yes. Did you feel his talent? We're still in the process of developing. He was an amazing pianist to begin with. I throbbed when I heard him play. Good evening. You came again? I won't approve of your marriage. Please listen, father. You have no right to call me father. Do you hate me? I do. You're allowed to play the piano which Yuko-chan wanted to but couldn't but you quit so easily. I can't entrust Yuko-chan to an irresponsible man like you. I have plenty of parents, so let's get their blessing first! Huh? If we get rid of the obstacles, I'm sure Morimiya-san will give in. Hold on. Did you just say you have plenty of parents? I haven't told you? No. I have 2 mothers and 3 fathers. Five in total. Not that many, huh? I think it's plenty enough. A trip to visit my parents, will you accompany me? Mitan has arrived. I'm so glad you came. It's been a while since my last visit. I'm sorry. Is this your fiancé? Nice to meet you, I'm Hayase Kento. You have a grand piano. Are you tuning it by yourself? It was my ex-wife's favorite piano who passed away a long time ago. When Yuko-chan wanted to play the piano again in elementary school, I decided to try to learn tuning the piano. You learned the tuning for me? I was interested in it. I had a wonderful time of being solemn. Tea is ready. Have a seat. I'm truly happy today! You came all the way here to tell me that you're marrying such a wonderful man. I'm so happy that you recognize me as one of your fathers. There's something I've always been wondering. Can I ask you about it? Why did you and Mama get married? Because of her deep affection to you. She only thought about you. I'm sure it would've been anyone who could give you a piano. But seeing her so eager without regard to appearance, it warmed my heart. If Rika-san wants to make you happy, I want to make her happy too. It made me think so. I was well pleased just having you near me. But we left you in the end. That's only between Rika-san and I. Don't worry about anything and be happy. Has she ever contacted you since? If it's her... I'm sure she's doing well somewhere. Are you Morimiya Yuko-sama? A package for you. Thank you. Thank you. "Tanaka Rika" It's from Mama. "Morimiya Yuko-sama" How have you been all this time? I left you since you were in middle school. How many years have passed? Actually, there is something I need to tell you. About your birth father, Mito Shuhei. You may think he is still in Brazil, but... His business got stuck, so he is now back in Japan. Inside the box there is a large number of letters that Mito-san addressed to you. I was afraid you'd say you wanted to go see your father, so... I've been keeping it to myself. I didn't send your letters to him either. Instead... "I don't want to see you, Papa." "I hate you for leaving me to go to Brazil." I sent out a letter of lies. Because I was afraid of losing you. It's unforgivable. I believe I did a selfish and terrible thing. I was the worst mother ever. I am truly sorry. Mito-san has since remarried and has children. He lives at his wife's house with the thought that you resent him. However... Even though you've been apart for so long, there hasn't been a single day goes by without thinking about you. His heart grows even fonder. I know that. So... Please go see him once. I'm still doing things my own way. There is such a thing as a fateful encounter, right? I am now very excited to start my journey into a new world! So, have you read the letters? Not yet. I was going to ask you if I should read it. Is there a choice that you don't want to read it? Because the letters are over 10 years old. I see. You can't respond to a letter asking you to send pickled plums to Brazil now, right. She told me to go see him, but it's totally too late now. What? You're not even going to see him? I mean, he has a new family. He even has children. You don't have to be modest. It's normal for a daughter to meet her birth father. Morimiya-san, don't you dislike it? You've been raising me as a father for years but I'd meet my birth father after all this time. I don't mind at all. You don't hold a grudge against Rika, do you? My old self as Mitan would never forgive her. Forgive her. Rika just didn't want Mito-san to take you. I can relate to her. Even after Rika left. What would happen if he said he wanted to take you back? I was always worried about that. Because I knew that you love Mama the most. Actually... The woman we're waiting for at the restaurant was Rika. I hope you won't tell Yuko that I came. Just go see her at least once. Do you think I have a face to see her now? Just have a dinner is OK, otherwise I'd feel guilty too. In the end she didn't come, but... I'm sure she actually wanted to see you. Because all she cared about was you. But what about Mito-san's position? I can't turn the clock back. That's exactly why. You should go see him now. I guess we should go back. What are you saying? We've come all the way here. But... Are you... Mitan? You can tell it's me? Yeah! Have some. Thank you. I always hear about you from my husband. About me? Over and over again. Try our apples. This is the letters you wrote to Yuko that Rika-san sent. Unfortunately, it didn't reach Mitan. Only now did she finally get around to reading it. "How are you, Mitan?" "How was school going?" "Are you having troubles?" "You must obey what Mama says." The simple words were overflowing with feelings for Mitan. Actually, a package was sent to me as well. No address in the sender's column. Only "Tanaka Rika" was written there. The letters Mitan wrote to me also didn't reach me back then. "Why won't you reply me, Papa?" "When will you come back?" "I miss you." Mitan, you must've really loved Papa. If only at that time I had followed Papa... But I... ...chose Mama. Mitan, you did nothing wrong. I went off to Brazil by myself. Regretting it now... ...won't help. I'm sorry, Yuko-san. I took away Papa from you. Are you okay? You can use my handkerchief. Thank you. You're welcome. Come here. Why was Rika-san so afraid that Yuko might go to see you? Why would she go that far for Yuko? I don't think she could've lived without Mitan. Before we met, she was ill and unable to bear children. To her... I think it was a deep and heavy wound. I'm sure the love and affection for you made her happy. In fact, she gave everything she had to you. But you must know how Yuko needed you. And yet, Rika-san... Hayase-kun. It's okay now. Had I followed Papa, he wouldn't have had such a wonderful family. And that's how... I can meet Papa now. So... I think it's time to forget the past. I'll borrow it. I remembered it today. My mother was so happy when I started playing the piano. At that time, I just wanted to see my mother happy. So I played it like crazy. And before I know... Something has changed. Your mother believed that you'd return to playing the piano. Even I was saved by your piano. What? When I started to cry earlier, you held my hand, right? At that moment, your piano started playing inside me. And then... I felt gently calm. I really think you should play the piano. I can be the cook. But only you can play the piano that touches people's hearts. You've been playing it your whole life. No matter how hard I try to escape. In the end, I have to play the piano. I still think we should be Rossini together! Mom. I have no memories of you, but... Whenever something happened since I was little, I always stared at your photo. Thanks to you, I am alive and well. And soon... I will marry this man. Please watch over us. Morimiya-san. Well, I also wanted to express my gratitude to the mother who gave birth to you. Morimiya-san. I took a lot of detours, but I decided to pursue the path of a pianist. So that it can touch someone's heart and make their loved ones as happy as possible, I will continue to play it wholeheartedly. I ask for your blessing in our marriage. You know. I received this wedding gift from Izumigahara-san. Three million in. We can accept it. Take it, I'm sure Izumigahara-san will be happy too. You both work part-time for a living. If you have enough money, you can save more times to build your future. What? "Our future"? Does that mean you give blessing to our marriage? If Hayase-kun continues to be a pianist, I'm all for it. You're struck by his piano play to begin with, right? The trip to visit your parents is now over, I guess. Not yet. I haven't visited Mama. But you don't know where she is, right? I want to see Mama. Can you forgive her? I love Mama... I do love Rika-san! I see. I want her to attend my wedding. I want her to see me as a bride. Actually... I got a phone call this morning. Huh? Rika-san had been fighting an illness for a long time. So that Mitan wouldn't notice, she lied and cheerfully said that she's on diet. But the truth is, she was worried. I'm also old myself. I don't know how long I'll live either. At this rate, we were afraid that Mitan wouldn't have parents. That's why she came to me. She's been getting well this month. She even laughed out loud last night. I'm sure you were surprised by my sudden call. I myself was really astounded too. She didn't go to Brazil with Mito-san because she wasn't sure about her health. And the reason she left your house was because of a relapse of her illness. At a certain time, she had trouble paying for treatment and tried to rely on you. But then she realized, she can't make you spend money that you'll use for Yuko. In the end, she came to me. And I didn't even notice it. Why were you like that? If you're sick, I'll take care of you. I've never expected to lost my parent because of illness. She probably didn't want to bother you. Bother me? Did you think I would be bothered of taking care of her? That's just how parents are. Why couldn't you have noticed? You're too oblivious to such things! Yuko wouldn't have noticed it either. But you met her once after that! I haven't met her even once ever since she left! I missed her. Sick or not, I wanted to be there for her. And yet. Mama kept quiet and disappeared. Died on her own. Because you didn't put enough effort! You're right. It was my fault. No. Rika-san tried so hard to hide it. Say, Mama. I want you to stay alive forever. Don't you worry. Mama is very strong! If both of your Mama died before you could grow up, it would be too sad for you. It's her decision to wander off and disappear. It would be better for you to think that she is still alive somewhere. That's what she said. Even if she died, she didn't want you to know. But Morimiya-san didn't agree. He's sure you'd want to see her no matter how her condition is. He absolutely has to let you meet her. I'm sure that Rika... ...always wanted to be a healthy mother in your memories. Did she know about my marriage? Of course she was very happy to hear it. Suddenly, her condition was improving. We even went shopping for your wedding dress. Yuko will definitely look good in this dress. The thought of seeing you wearing it in your wedding photo gave her hope to survive. I wish Mama could dress it to me. I wish Mama could see it. Mama left without seeing anything. She saw it. Your graduation. What? You came to see it. My piano playing. Thank you, Mama. Yuko-chan. Morimiya-san. I'm not crying. Precisely at a time like this that we should smile. Because Mama is just wandering off and she's still alive somewhere, right? Thank you, Mother. You just got yourself another new parent. You're beautiful, Yuko-san. See you later. Hello. Mito-san will arrive shortly. I'm a lucky daughter. I have three fathers and am loved by all of them. That's why I'm here now. No, you are the reason we are here today. That's right. Especially me. I graduated from UTokyo but I was aimless and I didn't know what I was living for. Then one day, I was entrusted with the role your father. My life became dazzlingly colorful. I found my reason to live. It was thanks to Mama, right? Yeah. Excuse me. Mito-sama has arrived. Thank you for coming all the way here. As you may have heard. We will ask you as Yuko's birth father to walk her down the aisle. Please allow me to decline. What? But you've came all the way here... That is your role as her father, Morimiya-san. You've raised such a sweet daughter. All I have is gratitude. But I don't know what I could have done as a father. I don't even have confidence. Morimiya-san. I thought it was your duty as a father to send me off to marriage? I think it's weird to wear wristwatch in a wedding dress. Take it off. I'll keep wearing it. Because this is the wristwatch that you gave me. Are you crying? I mean. I'm going to walk you down the aisle. I think any father would cry at a moment like this. You shouldn't cry. Smile, and it will attract all kinds of luck your way. Shall we? Morimiya-san. Yuko-chan is truly a wonderful daughter. After all, she is filled with the love of several parents. And she has brighten up their lives. I was trying my best not to drop the baton her parents passed me. And somehow I managed to get here. Take my baton and hold on to it. I will. And so, the baton is passed to me.
