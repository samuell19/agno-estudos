(bright music) (mysterious music) (machine whines) (brooding music) (Pete speaks in Russian) (Pete speaks in Russian) (dramatic music) (starter pistol fires) (Goldine yelling) (Goldine groaning) 0.14. You're gonna have to do better than that. You're never gonna get anyplace this way. Dammit, Pete, that hurt like a son of a bitch. I don't care that it hurt. When your reaction time is down to 0.12, then you'll beat the electric shock. You get away from the blocks any slower than that, you can bet your ass I'm gonna step up the impulse. Now, come on, get on your feet. Let's go. You're gonna make 0.12 before we finish this session, and 0.11 tomorrow. By the time Moscow rolls around, you're gonna be jet-propelled or burnt toast. (Pete speaks in Russian) (Pete speaks in Russian) (machine whines) (dramatic music) (starter pistol fires) (Goldine yelling) (Goldine groans) 0.13. That's a little better, a little better. Let's go again, though. We're gonna get down to 0.12 if we have to fry your fingernails off. Now, come on. Let's go again. (brooding music) Come on, come on, keep the energy up, don't drag it. Quit feeling sorry for yourself. This is the one that might get you to Moscow. (Pete speaks in Russian) (man whistling) We call this young lady Goldengirl, Mr. Dryden. [Jack] Yeah. As you can see, she's extremely tall, 6'2". She's also one of the most interesting subjects physiologically you're ever likely to meet. Since 1948, I have researched the case histories of all the American Olympic teams, and the trend in linear growth is one centimeter a decade, and still rising. Of course, you can find girls as tall as she is, even taller, but you're unlikely to find one with comparable physical capacity and muscular development. And I speak with a background of 30 years in anthropometry. In short, Mr. Dryden, this young lady is eugenically 30 to 40 years ahead of her time. Really? Now, let's see how this translates to athletic activities. Here you see her undergoing gun response therapy. She's 9% taller than the average height of the world's best. Thus, her muscular strength is greater by as much as 19%. Now that she's warmed up, she will have to run the 100 meters against the clock, and I have to tell you that she's never taken part in any competitive activity. As you know, 11 seconds flat is the women's. Olympic record for the 100-meter dash. Therefore, the time you've just seen of 11:17 ranks her among the top half dozen sprinters of the world, and she's achieved that without starting blocks. Now perhaps you can understand why we call her Goldengirl. [Jack] What kind of a score are you looking for? [Gino] Originally, we laid out $250,000. [Jack] That's a lot of money. We built a training camp in the mountains. We had to hire an expert track coach, a consultant psychologist. A nutritionist cook. Right, a nutritionist cook, and assorted staff members. By the time we get to Moscow, the total cost will be in excess of $800,000. And you hope to recover this money through merchandising? Jack, we didn't go into this to break even. We intend to make $10 million besides. $10 million? Oh, come on. I mean the girl's a knockout. Well, she may be a marvelous one, but there's no way you can turn $10 million by winning the Olympic 100 meters. And if she would win the 100, the 200, and the 400? Well, maybe if you threw in the marathon with it. Please, Mr. Dryden, indulge my fantasy. If Goldengirl would do the impossible and win the three events, what kind of revenue could you raise? I don't deal in dream stuff. $5 million? Seven? No woman has ever won the three. Olympic sprints for a very simple reason. See, with all of the heats, in total she'd have to run 12 world-class races in five days, and that can't be done. Yeah, but what about if she's always- - She's likely to spike herself in the turn, pull a muscle, catch a cold. She can have a heart attack tomorrow, but it's unlikely. Yeah, okay. Pressure. Olympic pressure. What about that? In 1968, what was that girl? - 800 meters. - 800-meter world record holder tried to commit suicide, and she was only entered in one event. Now you say your girl can compete in three events? You have no idea what kind of pressure she'll be under. Her parents must be crazy to put through that kind of torture. (Gino laughs) Do I strike you as crazy? Why? Goldengirl is my daughter by adoption. Her real name is Goldine, and my wife and I took out the papers in 1964. But she was only encouraged to be a runner after we became convinced of her athletic talents. But you will see for yourself when you meet her. Oh yeah, I'd like to. [Bill] Good. Let's fly up to the camp now. - Now? - Yes. You'll see some training and get a better understanding of our operation. And tomorrow in San Diego, you'll see her run her first competitive race. [Jack] Well, that should be interesting. [Bill] More than interesting. She has to produce times good enough to qualify for the Olympic tryouts next month. Hello, Doctor. How was your flight? Good, good. Pete Winters, meet Jack Dryden, best sport agent in the world. Aren't you the Pete Winters from Cornell? Right. Hey, you ran the 400 meters in 45.6, qualified for the Olympic trials, and pulled an Achilles tendon, right? You got one hell of a memory. Good afternoon, Mr. Dryden. I'm Dr. Sammy Lee, in charge of Goldengirl's psychological training. - How do you do? - Mr. Valenti. Won't you sit down? Now, we'd like to show you a demonstration aimed primarily at preparing a triple Olympic winner at coping with life as a public figure. So just imagine yourself in Moscow, several weeks from now, and this is Goldengirl's press conference after winning her third gold medal. [Jack] Hm-hmm. Uh, by the way, you were even invited to put some questions to her yourself during the session, but with one proviso: All of Goldengirl's conditioning has been aimed at her winning three gold medals. Failure or even partial success is not something she's been conditioned for. (recording rewinding) [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, triple Olympic champion, Ms. Goldine Serafin, is here with her father, Dr. William Serafin, to meet the press. (audience applauding) [Russian] Congratulations, Ms. Serafin, from the people of the Soviet Union. Thank you very much for your warm reception. [Russian] Did you believe it possible? It was a dream that you would win three gold medals? I still can't believe that it's really happened. But, uh, at the risk of sounding conceited, I didn't come to Moscow to lose. (audience laughing) [Russian] How much your preparation- - [Englishman] Which was the most difficult medal to win? I'll take the second question first. The 400 was the most difficult because it's the longest. Now, as far as preparation, was continual, seven days the week. [American] Excuse, Ms. Serafin, do you mind the sacrifices? [Goldine] Sacrifices? [American] You know, like not going out on dates. Well, you can't run laps after dark, but other things aren't impossible. (audience laughing) Like reading or listening to music. [Woman] What about the future, Goldine? Will you continue to run, or will you take advantage of the commercial opportunities open to you? Well, are those things mutually exclusive? I mean, I know I'd like to keep running, for sure, but I don't know much about commerce. You see, reading the "Wall Street Journal". Isn't really my scene. Oh! Oh no. What journal do you represent? (audience laughing) There's a story that you trained in the mountains somewhere. Do you credit your success in the Olympic Games to running at high altitude? No, no, not at all. You see, at 6'2", you could say that all my running's been done in high altitude. (audience laughing) Do you think that commercialism is destroying the spirit of the Olympic Games? Oh, well, I believe in the Olympic ideal, that the important thing is the taking part of, not the winning. Yes, but winning gold medals means a lot of money. Don't you think that commerce is a threat to that ideal? Well, I, uh, I don't know much about commerce. You see, reading the "Wall Street Journal" isn't, um... I think she's answered the question. Goldine doesn't understand anything of this. But thank you for the question, Mr. Dryden. Do we have another one? What are your plans for this evening, Goldengirl? This evening? Well, I don't have anything arranged. Let me see. (scoffs) Get yourself some stilts, Mister, and you might have a date. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) [Bill] Very clever of you, Mr. Dryden, catching Goldine off balance with that question. [Jack] Yeah, she responds to trigger questions and trigger words, doesn't she? So when commerce was mentioned a second time, all she could come up with was her "Wall Street Journal" bit. [Sammy] Very good, Mr. Dryden. The press conference, how does a good performance in front of a few reporters make a good performance on a track? It's very simple. Confidence off the track means confidence on it. You see, when I met Goldine, she was very shy, repressed. Talking to any stranger was an ordeal for her, let alone a group of reporters. Well, congratulations. I mean, that press conference was certainly no ordeal. She actually seemed to enjoy it, didn't she? She's been conditioned to consider it as a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Well, how do you do that? Let's just say we've managed to channel her psyche. Her psyche? Well, you're fooling around with kind of a delicate area there, aren't you? Yes, but I think we fooled around with it very delicately. Coffee is ready. I'm afraid Mr. Dryden is a little skeptical of our training methods. She will become a world-famous figure overnight, a goddess worshiped by millions. She has to be prepared. I don't think we convinced you. We're ready for you, Sammy. Let me show you something, Mr. Dryden. All right. In Moscow, as you know, Goldine will have to run 12 races in five days. Yes, I know. Well, here's one of the ways we tried to improve her stamina. Pete, at what time did she fall down this last exercise? Uh, 1248.6. 1:48.6. Now we shall repeat this exercise. [Jack] Al right. Goldine, this time you're going for gold. I want to hear you say it. "I'm going for gold." I'm going for gold. Right. Ready? And one. I'm going for gold. Two. - I'm going for gold. - Three. - I'm going for gold. - Four. - I'm going for gold. - Five. - I'm going for gold. - Let me hear it! - I'm going for gold. - That's a girl. See the pace. See the pace. Go for the pace. That's a girl, that's a girl. That's a girl. That's a girl, that's a girl. That's a girl. 1:20. 1:61. Good. That's it. That's wonderful. - Good girl. - Good, good, good, good. What kept you? I was really worried. The weather, the visibility got so bad, we had to land at another airfield. Did we missed something? Yes, Goldine's heat in the 200. She came in second. 23.7. Only second? - Yeah, well, she qualified. - That's all we wanted. Pete told her to save the real running for the finals. [Gino] Ah, uh-huh. Jack! Hey, Jack! Hey, Vince. How are you? - All right. - Good to see you again. What are you doing down here in San Diego? I run this club now. - No kidding? - What are you doing at a silly little meet like this? [Jack] Well, I had to be in town for the weekend, and the (indistinct) on the road, so I thought I'd come down here. [Vince] And this is your thing going, huh? - Yeah. - What would you do if sports had never been invented, huh? (both laughing) Hey, good seeing you, Vince. Great to see you too. Enjoy yourself. Yeah, I will. Bye-bye. Oh, Vince Saperstein's a great coach. He's helped some of my out with their speed. Here we go. Hey, the track looks wet. Does that pose a problem? [Bill] Oh, we have allowed for every track condition in our preparation. [Sammy] Besides it's wet for everybody. There she is. Gentlemen, I'm sorry we are late. It was unavoidable. Doesn't matter, Doctor. Our girl did fine. She hung right onto the pacesetter, and didn't even move into second gear. I would like you to meet two other members of our consortium. - This is Michael Cobb. - How do you do? And Noah Sternberg. Michael's in the clothing business, and Noah is a famous- - Yes, he's boxing promoter, right? He's my favorite. How are you? That's right. How are you doing? [Announcer] The first heat of the 100 meters. Starting with lane one, there's Debbie Jackson, the fastest qualifier in the 200. Next to her we have Marlene da Costa, winner of the 200 heat. In lane three, the Bakersfield Flash, Goldine Serafin. Right beside her- - I told her to come home in second in this race, too. Again second? Yeah, I figured Jackson will lead the pack, and it'll be Goldine's job to edge out Da Costa. Wouldn't it be less risky to go for a win? No, with three finals to come and the Olympic qualifying times to set, no. The best thing for her to do is conserving energy. No point in burning it out in the heats. [Starter] On your mark. [Announcer] Remember, folks, only those who place first or second qualify for the finals. [Starter] Get set. (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) [Announcer] Fast forward with Da Costa, Winsbury, and O'Donnell. Here's Jackson and Serafin. And here comes Winsbury. And it's Jackson. Winsbury pulling ahead, and it's Serafin third. Oh shit. (crowd cheering) There goes $800,000. She blew it, she blew it. Stupid bitch. Nailed by a fourth-rate club runner. It's unbelievable. [Bill] Don't talk that way of Goldine again. No! (Melancholy music) (Goldine sobbing) [Sammy] Come on, let's be practical. She still has two finals to run. [Gino] Yeah, but we already screwed up one. What good are the other two now? [Pete] There's still the San Jose relays. We can enter her in the 100 there. That's a major meet. If she doesn't win here, what makes you think she's gonna be successful there? Well, at least it's a chance. Let me go talk to her. I told you she lacked experience. I begged you to let me put her in another race before this. (melancholy music) - Put this on, Goldine. - You'll catch a cold. Pete should've warned me to look the other way. You can't blame Pete. But it was his strategy. Listen, you lost the race. Sammy, please. This is no time to feel sorry for yourself. But what if I couldn't do it now? You still go for gold. That's bullshit! No, you still go for gold! Why, why? I can't be Goldengirl anymore. Well, then you can't be anything. (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) Is anybody all right for a hot dog? Dryden, you gotta be kidding. Come on. You know, you haven't had anything since breakfast. How can you eat at a time like this? Well, they're there if you want one. When's the 2007 - After this race. I'll have one. [Announcer] The track meet's director, Vince Saperstein, has just told me that at the special request of an AAU official the number of girls in the finals will be increased from six to eight, so it's been decided that the two fastest losers will join the six qualifiers. That's Edith Mercer, who blocked 11.71 in heat two, and Goldine Serafin, with 11.75 in heat one. I don't know about you, but I'd like to thank that official for letting us get- - You? You're an AAU official? Well, Vince Saperstein's an old friend of mine. He's running the meet here today. And for this little gesture, I promised him that you would pick up his tab for his track club for the next two years. How much? Less than the interest on your $800,000. I've suddenly got an appetite. Dryden, I underestimated you. I have to thank you. No, no, no, you don't have to thank me. I just didn't wanna see our little group break up here before it had a chance. [Announcer] Folks, before this 200 final gets underway, I'd like to call your attention to the fact that Debbie Jackson in lane four hasn't been beaten in this event all year, and Marlene da Costa next to her, in lane five, has only been beaten once, and that's by Debbie Jackson. This could be the race of the afternoon. - (whistle blowing) - On your marks. [Jack] At least she's got the pole position. That's a break. No, she hates it. With her long legs, the bend's tighter on the inside. Really? I'm surprised, doctor. You haven't thought of shortening her legs? Well, we don't believe in cutting down the odds. Get set. (Whistle blowing) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) [Announcer] Coming out of the stagger, it's Da Costa holding the lead, and here comes Debbie Jackson. And around the turn it's Serafin (indistinct). Serafin in the lead. Debbie Jackson (indistinct) coming along fast. (indistinct) Marlene da Costa, and Winsbury. Now it's Serafin holding the lead. Debbie Jackson. Debbie Jackson second, and Serafin holding a long lead. And it's her win. (bright music) (whistle blowing) What a showdown is shaping up for the 100-meter final, folks. Debbie Jackson, the only girl in California to run 11.5 this year, versus the sensational Goldine Serafin. Can Debbie hold off Goldine's challenge in her favorite event? Watch. (starter pistol fires) False start, folks. Looks like Serafin. Nothing wrong with that. Her gun response is just faster than anybody else's. They'll disqualify her if it happens again. [Announcer] I might remind you that two false starts, by Olympic rules, disqualifies you. [Starter] On your mark. Get set. (starter pistol fires) [Announcer] And they're off. And it's Jackson pulling ahead. Jackson. O'Donnell is clawing back. And here comes Serafin, Serafin, but Jackson still holding. Serafin is gaining and pulling ahead, and it's Serafin. (crowd cheering) That runs was electronically timed at 11.4. That means two Olympic qualifying times in both sprints by the unknown blonde from Bakersfield. This is gonna cause quite a shakeup in the world of women's track. Well, I don't think I can stand the excitement without one more hot dog. Anybody wanted any more? - Yeah, I'll have one. - I'll have a couple more. Damn, I don't know what you use for fuel, but I sure wish I had some. Thank you. Hey, Jack. That girl is some runner. She's beautiful. - She is, and thank you. - Your club's all taken care of. Hey, thank you. Listen, you're gonna run a test on her? A dope test? - Yeah. - Why? You know something I don't? Well, listen, an unknown girl who runs two Olympic qualifying times in one afternoon, I'd like to know what she's taking, wouldn't you? Well, I never considered it. Well, you know how those guys from the association can be. People get very fussy. You're the director of this meet, and you want those times to stand. And if she qualifies for the 400, she's gonna be a hot item. Don't give 'em anything- - [Vince] Look, I don't have the facilities to run a dope analysis. I'll have to send it to the Clayward Center. Do that, then. Do you really think it's necessary? You got your club outta hock, Vince. Come on, protect yourself. Harry, when the Serafin girl finishes her last event, would you bring her directly to my office? Yeah. I decided to run a medical test. You're kidding. Hey, Jack. Well, get her over here right away. You won't believe this. She just won the 400 by 20 meters, and the time was only two tenths of a second off the American record. The kid must be a junkie. Yeah, she must be. What about that cigarette commercial? How'd it go? Oh, the doctor said I is a fabulous running machine, and the only dope is Saperstein for ordering the test in the first place. Uh, where are the others? No, they won't be here. No, listen, Franz, tell 'em. No, I'm not risking him catching emphysema for that piddling amount. You do something about it. Okay, talk to you later. Bye-bye. Well. I engineered that little test in order to get a little time alone with you. (scoffs) Okay, I think you'd better put me in a cab. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I just wanna talk with you, away from those others. Well, we had our little talk yesterday. That was no talk. That was a floor show. Daddy's gonna be really mad. [Jack] He'll be even madder when I tell him I'm not representing you. Huh. Well, big deal. After today, there'll be dozens of agents just standing in line. Yeah, and they'll probably do a hell of a lot better job than I can. Come on. I'll find you a cab. [Goldine] Well, hey, wait a minute. You'd really walk away from all this? You just watch me. Listen, I'm not representing you just because you can run fast. There's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Oh, like what? Well, I have to sell you to major companies. I have to be able to guarantee that you'll fulfill those obligations. With every deal I make, my reputation goes on the line. So there you go. - Well, you needn't worry. - Your reputation is safe with me. Ah, yeah, but I don't know that, you see? I can only represent someone I understand, like Dick Armitage. I know why he wants to be the best tennis player there is, because when he was young, he had polio, and tennis was therapy. Now he's afraid to lay off one day for fear he'll stiffen up. I've got a golf pro who's won every major tournament there is, yet he goes on a tour year after year. Why? Just to get out of the house. He's got a wife he hates. Huh! See, I'm a money-grabbing son of a bitch. I'll push anybody who's a winner and take my cut, as long as I can understand what makes 'em tick, and you I don't have a clue about. Well, um, I'm a simple American girl who has been born to win three Olympic medals. Ah, crap. That's that Dr. Lee's feedback, isn't it? Who the hell are you? Can't you talk? Well, sure. I mean, what do you want? Who is Goldine Serafin, huh? (bright music) Forget it, kid. Come on. I'll find you a cab. No, wait. I wanna tell you, really, it's- - Well, tell me. Well, it's hard for me to talk about myself, about Goldine. I look in the mirror and I don't even recognize her anymore. You see, he had a theory on oxygen intake, too. In order to expand my ribcage, he put me in this old-time corset. But, well, instead of compressing you, it would fasten under your ribs and pull out. Oh God, I hated that thing. I hated those injections, too. What injections? Iron, once a week, right up until I was 16. Oh, it's all in the record books. I'm not giving you feedback now, am I? Not that I can tell. Well, sometimes I can't. I've had too many of those stimulus response sessions. Oh, is that what they used at that press conference the other day? How does that work? Um... Well... Huh? (Goldine laughs) What's matter? Um... Well, it's something anybody could buy for few dollars. What? (laughs) A vibrator. - You're joking. - No. A vibrator? Well, you see Sammy starting me off with one. She always taught me not to have any inhibitions about my body or its needs. Is that right? So we started using it in the stimulus response sessions. Uh, privately, though, not with all that jazz, the lights and applause and stuff like you saw in the simulated press conference. Uh-huh. Just, um, questions and answers. Well, I was wired up so that each time I gave a good response, I got good vibes, literally. Well, I made a lot of progress that way. Yeah, I'll bet. (Goldine laughs) Well, you see, now, well, I don't need the vibrator anymore. I get the same response just from hearing the questions and knowing I have the answers ready. Whew, well, we've really come a long way since Pavlov's dog, haven't we? (laughs) Yeah. [Dick] The "LA Chronicle" calls her the mystery blonde, the track sensation of the year, and the "San Diego Times" has a theory that she's been secretly training in Europe under an assumed name. [Gino] Hey, hey, I just heard on the radio, the AAU have authenticated her times. [Michael] Oh, that's very good news. - How do you like that? - I'd say we created just the right amount of interest at this stage. All that remains is the question of Mr. Dryden's participation. [Valenti] Yeah, that's right, Dryden. You know, the suspense is killing me. Are you in or out? Tell the troupe. Listen, generally, with an unknown, it takes me three to five years before I see any profit. Even then it's a gamble. But in this case, with the Olympics so close, I don't wanna be gambling around six weeks. I'm in. Oh, I knew it. Providing she delivers three gold medals, I can set contracts for around, oh, $20 million. - Oh! - 20 million? What? That's double our target. Come on, come on, drive, drive, drive. You blow it with your lame muscles. What do you call that, huh? Goldine, you're running 199 meters and he's running 200. Come on. Harry is taking you every damn time on that dip. You're either too late or you run your last 10 yards like Groucho Marx or somebody. Come on, one more time. Up, up, let's go. Harry, one more time, all right? - That was really hard. - What? Oh, I busted my hump catching her. You mean you can't give 15 meters in 200 to a woman? Hey, four times, but, man, she was really burning that last 50. You know, brother. All right, hit the showers. Hey, Red, you take the next one. You're rested, all right? All right, everybody, let's go, let's go. Hey, what's matter with you? Well, how about a little encouragement once in a while, huh? I mean, dammit, Pete. I am really trying out there, you know? It's not much fun racing against guys and getting beat all the time. You like winning, don't you, like you did in San Diego? Maybe I should ask the guys to ease off a little bit and give you a free ride, huh? (Goldine scoffs) Look, you blew it in San Diego in that 100 heat, but all right, you shouldn't have made the finals. It is not gonna happen at the trials, you understand? Now get your ass moving. [Goldine] I don't understand Pete anymore, Sammy. You know, one day he slaps me down, and the next day he just clams up and makes me feel like I'd be better off baton twirling. Why do you think his attitude has changed? Oh, I miss my target sometimes. Like yesterday, we were on 100s, eight altogether. I was averaging about 11:15. "Well, that's slow." Yes. Yeah, but I was bucking a headwind. So I asked if he would reverse it for the other runs, and he comes back with, "Well, why don't you ask the consortium to build you an astro do me?" (Sammy laughs) Yeah, well, I'm glad you think it's funny. Hey, Goldine, where's your sense of humor? Pete's knocked it right out of me. - And your appetite, too? - Yes, my appetite, too. I am sick of all this protein garbage. I wanna eat normal food like normal people. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's remember the qualities needed in a champion. (Goldine groans) The ability to function in disaster and to finish in style. Yes, I know, but Pete doesn't have to club me silly to teach me that. Yeah, there can still be a little joy in all this training. Oh, honey. The joy will come later. Believe me, when you'll be rich and famous, you'll get all the love you'll ever want. Believe me. You watch this. [Goldine] Sammy, I don't wanna watch anything. I wanna talk. Yes, yes, yes, we'll talk later. Betty Cuthbert winning the 100? Oh, I've seen it. You haven't watched this. This is something new. Dave Roberts, world record. Paul Walter, 1976. Listen to those crowds. Now, Roger Bannister, 1954. The first time the mile was run under four minutes. Now, will you watch this? This is incredible. Now watch the finish, watch the finish. They went crazy. Look. He was on every front page, every newspaper of the nation. And now look at Bob Beamon in 1968. Jumped over 29 feet. He's never been beaten since. Oh, did the world ever admire him. Look, look! Nadia. Oh, perfect score. Perfect score of 10. I don't know how many medals she won, but oh, did the world love her. Look at her. And they'll never forget her. Oh, they gave her a ticker tape reception. Look at the motorcade. Stop it. Please, stop! All this crap about winning. But that's all that matters. Oh, shut up. I know the routine. Pete slaps me down and you pick me up. Then why don't you work harder? No one ever worked harder than I have. Nonsense! That's nonsense, and you know it! Nonsense? You want nonsense, Sammy? Scratch the Olympics and scratch Goldengirl. I quit! Goldine! Goldine, come back here at once! It's about time. You're late. We got a gun response session. Take the gun response and shove it up your ass, Pete! (Goldine sobbing) Sammy tells me you want to quit. [Goldine] Yes, yes, and don't try to talk me out of it. You apologize to Pete and Sammy right now. No, I won't! I won't apologize to them. I hate them. I hate this place. - I hate running. - How dare you? You behave like a child giving up piano lessons. As your father, I won't permit it. Oh, oh, my father? Oh, that's a good one. Well, if you'd behave like any kind of a normal father, then maybe I'd listen to you. But you're not anymore. No! (Goldine sobbing) (melancholy music) [Bill] I haven't show you the affection you deserve. That's the one area that's been neglected. I'm very sorry. I don't to talk about it now. But we have to talk. [Goldine] No! (Sobs) Whether you recognize it or not, the one thing you crave most is affection, and that's all that Sammy was trying to say in a clumsy way. All she was talking about was winning. It comes with winning. All you really want is for people to care and love you. And winning will bring that fulfillment. When you collect those medals in Moscow, you will be the focus of more pride and more affection than any individual on Earth. Maybe you can achieve it some other way, but I don't know how, do you? No. Daddy. (crowd cheering) All right, he's done it, 2.75 meters, and he goes into undisputed first place. Yes. But the real story of these trials, Bob Beamon, is still the Bakersfield Flash, Goldine Serafin. Yesterday, she set a US record in the 100-meter final, and barely an hour ago, she equaled the US record in the 200-meter quarter-final. Now she's getting set to compete in the semifinals of the 400. Yeah, actually, Steve, everyone here is wondering, are there any limits to this girl's ability? Well, apparently there are none. She's gonna have to watch the Martinez girl in lane one, though. She's unbeaten this season. (whistle blowing) [Starter] Get set. (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) Come on, come on. There we go, that's it, that's it. There we go, there we go. (crowd cheering) Where is she? Come on, there you go, come on. That was Serafin, Martinez, and Wilson. And listen to the time: 50.56 seconds. Unbelievable, Steve. That equals Janie Canute's US record set two months ago in Indiana. The showdown between these two record holders tomorrow oughta to be the race of the year. You were a champion today, Goldine. You know that? You were a champion. - But she dipped. - No! Hey, give her some space, will you? It was Goldengirl, Goldengirl. Oh, Pete, I've been waiting so long for you to say something nice. Hey, anybody want a pair of track shoes that came in eighth in the Olympic trials? Size seven, urethane-coated kangaroo uppers with rat brown heels. Huh? No takers? Well, here's my contribution to the US Olympic appeal. Come on, Annie. We can try again in '84. Forget it, I ran the best time of my life, and Miss Statue of Liberty makes me look like I'm standing still. Hey, hey! I just wanna thank you. Me? For what? I'm hanging up my cleats 'cause of you. From now on I'm breaking records in smoking, drinking, and S-E-X. And as for you guys, you're gonna live, and you can thank Ms. G. Serafin for that. (Laughs) Now, why can't we continue to grow. Because of him. What's the matter with him? I've seen worse playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (laughs) His poor bones are just not constructed to carry additional height, and his heart lacks the capacity to furnish the circulation a taller person would require. Professor Walsh, I have basketball players that I represent that are over seven foot tall. Now, I don't see anything wrong with their heart or their circulation or the structure of their skeleton. You're missing the point. We've always had giants or dwarves. Growth follows a bell-shaped curve. Here's your basketball player on this end of the lip, the tallest end of the growth spectrum. Midgets are over here. They have no bearing on the norm, here. So if Dr. Serafin's hypothesis is correct, he has to prove that the bell is edging toward the taller end. Yes, but because of the limitations of the human frame, we think he's wrong. Well, let's assume he is right. What's so earth-shaking about that? Well, if the average person were taller, then his muscular development would have to increase proportionately. It's okay. Would you get Edmund, please? That's him there? Yes. Thank you. I suppose you've come up with a physically-superior being. Physically-superior being? Well, that kind of has echoes of the old super race philosophy, doesn't it? Forgive me, Mr. Dryden, but that's a rather cruel insinuation to lay on a man just because he speaks with a German accent. No, he was educated under Hitler, and I've seen a few things that indicate that he may have retained some of that ideology. Well, he's never communicated any of them to me. I only know Bill as a serious, if not somewhat misguided, scientist. I think you're on the wrong track. Yeah? Well, is there any definitive way that he can prove his theories? Well, a centimeter a decade, four inches a century. Unfortunately I won't live that long. Well, what about artificially-induced growth? Isn't there some kind of drug that can do that? Uh, yes, there's PSH, the pituitary stimulant hormone. PSH? It's used to remedy certain forms of dwarfism. Take a look at Godzilla here. He used to be a normal size until we injected him with PSH. You mean he was one of these guys? [Walsh] Yes. [Jack] (whistles) Godzilla. Well, couldn't it be given to a normal human being? That would be a grotesque idea. Why? To pump a normal person with hormones, you run the risk of anything from kidney failure to gross deformities. Uh-huh, so there's no safe drug. No, no safe drug. [Jack] I had these drawn up to illustrate the kind of campaign that I have in mind. [Gino] Well, that's just great, but what's this with the Dryden, Dryden, Dryden? [Jack] It's just a name that we use until we know what the real product is, Gino. - Christ. - You know, Dryden, they're all very impressive, but can you firm any deals before she wins in Moscow? No, no, no, no, I can just draw up the contracts, all contingent on her winning a triple in Moscow. Yeah, two golds and we wind up with zero. (chuckles) What's the matter, Gino, you scared? Yeah. It's always the way it's been, hasn't it? - That's right. - I mean, all or nothing. Well, fine, then that leaves me with only three things to worry about. Yeah, will she win three golds? Yeah, that's one. The next is the press. Now, you'll have to get rid of that (sighs) fancy training camp you got up there. I mean, you know, if you wanna keep all of that - money you spend secret. - Oh, no, we have already started to dismantle the retreat. By the end of the week, there will be nothing left over for a curious reporter. Anyway, where the hell is she gonna train, huh? I have arranged facilities for her at the Arizona State University near Phoenix. The Dean is a colleague of mine. Now, what's your final worry? You, Dr. Serafin. I'm cynical enough to believe there's more here than meets the eye. Now, there's something about this project that's more important to you than money, isn't there? I've never made a secret of my scientific interest. What are you getting at? Are you planning to publish your findings? Yes, I've just finished an article for the "American Journal of Physiology," but that wouldn't hurt the merchandising. Who the hell cares if we're all growing taller? We want the public to brush their teeth with Goldengirl toothpaste and drink gallons of Goldengirl orange juice. Now, they'll do that for the pretty blonde they cried their hearts out for when she picked up that third gold medal. God, they'll do it for America's darling, the little orphan girl who came outta nowhere and beat the world's best, but what happens- - Forgive me, Mr. Dryden, but we have really more important- - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's hear what Dryden's - driving at. - Just get to the point. Well, the point is, what happens when they find out she's a test tube athlete, that she's not a golden girl, but a golden Guinea pig, a 6'2" physiological freak? (Noah whistles) The Dow Jones just dropped 50 points. Yeah, well, that's my worry. It won't be like that. In the scientific paper, I don't have to mention her name. How can you hide it? After Moscow, she's gonna be a world celebrity, and the press is gonna be looking for some dirt to switch the golden halo anyway. Gentleman, you cannot deny me this opportunity. I have devoted a lifetime to this work. And what about our $800,000 investment, Doc? - What about that? - That's right. I've invested even more than that. My company is bringing out a completely new line of Goldengirl clothing. I can't let you jeopardize that. Michael, you are an intelligent man. Have you any idea of the magnitude of the importance of this study? How can you ask me to forgo publication? I will not allow a crass financial consideration to obstruct a scientific breakthrough. A crass financial consideration. Well, maybe we will withdraw our crass financial support. Michael, don't threaten me. You're forgetting, this project is still under my control. Goldengirl is my daughter- - Goldengirl is also- And she will do- - our investment. - As I say. And if you insist on your position, I will simply pull her out of the trials, and you will lose all your money and your new line of clothing. That's it, gentleman. I'm going to have my lunch. Dr. Serafin, can I join you a minute? You've just given me an education, Mr. Dryden. I have never realized in how many areas an agent involves himself. Well, an agent's primary responsibility is to protect his client's earning power, that's it. When it comes to this particular client, do you really think it would endanger it? Listen, Doctor, I didn't come down here to argue with you. I think I know the importance of this project to you, and your desire to publish is perfectly understandable. I just wanna make a suggestion about how we can possibly compromise. Can I sit down? - Mm. - Thank you. Would you be willing to delay publication for, say, two years, or until we hit our $20 million target, whichever comes sooner? Pulling her from the trials doesn't really serve your purpose either, does it? Don't you think I know that? Well, you don't have to make a decision on it right now. Sleep on it. Let me know. [Bill] Listen, Dryden, I don't like you very much. I guess that's my answer. However, I will delay. When you've waited as long as I have to prove yourself, you can wait a little longer. Congratulations. I saw you in the 100 the other day. You really scorched 'em. You know, you must have an awful lotta talent going through three events. I mean, I don't know any other girls who's ever tried it. Don't think I don't know who you are. You're Janie Canute, and you hold the US record in the 400. So? So what are you trying to do? Psych me out? Honey, you've got a lot to learn. (somber music) Oh shit. Hey, I know it's our big day;, and we gotta take it kinda easy, but don't you think we oughta do another lap? Yeah, but Pete, I don't feel right. What's the matter? Your leg? Yeah, there's this heaviness there. I've never felt that before. Hmm, maybe we are pushing a little hard. Why don't you go back to the hotel, and I'll get Ingrid to give you a rubdown? Okay. Thanks, Pete. All right. How is she, Doctor? There's nothing wrong with her. It's anxiety, that's all. Look, Doc, in all the time that I've worked with her, she's never had a physical complaint before. She's never been in a major competition before. (somber music continues) - It's Serafin. (Indistinct) - (crowd cheering) [Bob] Serafin looked a little tired in the stretch, Steve. I wonder if she's got enough reserve to hold off Janie Canute in the 400. Well, we're just gonna have to wait and see. Yes, I guess we will. She is tired. There's something wrong. You okay? You don't look so good. - Name, please. - I'm okay. Uh, Goldine Serafin. - Do you need your coach? - I can walk you over to him. No. I just wanna sit here for a little bit. I don't need anything. Thanks. - Thanks. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. Two, please. Jack. Jack, hello. Steve Esselton, "Sports Report." - Oh, sure, how are you? - You arranged for me to interview Jim Hansenberg last season. Yeah, I remember. What do you have here? Covering up for the network, huh? Yeah, I got lucky. So far it turns out to be the story of the year, thanks to your potential client. - My potential client? - Who the hell is that? You're gonna tell me the biggest agent in the business comes all the way up here to be a spectator? No, actually I come up all this way to be with this beautiful lady here. Any other questions? No, just a tip. Keep your eye on this Serafin girl. She's a merchandiser's dream. - Merchandiser's dream? - Track's an amateur sport, Steve. Don't you know that? (Steve laughs) Ooh-hoo. Um, it's this gate. Where are we going? No, we can't sit with the consortium. I know that guy, he's digging for something, but we're not gonna let him find it here. Let's go down there. Hey, Doc, why's she sitting, huh? 400's coming up. Shouldn't she be moving around? [Bill] She knows what she's doing. She's psyching up. [Noah] Oh, psyching up, huh? (somber music) Oh, look. Janie. Listen, Janie, I, uh, I'm really sorry about this morning. [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the women's 400-meter final. Remember, only the first three qualify for the Olympic team. In lane one, Goldine Serafin, unaffiliated. Lane two, from Kansas University, Janie Canute. In lane three, Carol Adams, University of Southern California. In lane four, from Yale, Susan Brown. In lane five, Gloria Martinez, Penn State. Lane six, Nancy Jones from Oregon State. Lane seven, Cherie Miller, Crippenheim. Lane eight, Stella Ruben, Santa Barbara. [Starter] Get set. (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) [Announcer] It's Martinez off with a fast start. Coming out of the stagger with Martinez is Jones, with Canute in third, and brown a close fourth. It's still Martinez and Jones. Martinez and Jones and (indistinct). Jones and Canute (indistinct). It's a thrilling race for third place, but beyond that (indistinct). It's Canute and Serafin. They're neck and neck. And at the tape, Martinez wins it, Jones second, then it will be a photo for third place. (crowd cheering) (suspenseful music) Hey, baby, you okay? You okay? Yes, yes. - Legs. - You all right? [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the judges have just examined the photos for third place in the 400 meters. Goldine Serafin (indistinct). Yeah! (rousing music) Hey, knock 'em dead in Moscow, Goldine. Thanks, Janie. - Ah. - Congratulations, Goldine. Hey, thanks, man. (Goldine laughs) After today, you know, you're going to be besieged by agents with contracts for personal appearances, - endorsements, what have you. - Oh, really? Wow. You know, it's just possible you could make quite a killing out of the Olympics. How do you feel about that? - You bet your ass. - Endorsement contract? (Goldine and Jack laugh) Wow. Well, I've only recently- - Oh, he's evil. - Been thinking of myself - as a runner. - Yeah. That's the only thing I have on my mind. We are just ordinary people with no experience in sports. - Of course not. - Goldine wants to win for America. (Goldine chuckles) [Jack] Well, it took you to third place for that. - Well, it was difficult. - The competition in Moscow will be against a former-Oh, Jack, watch this. - East German sprint champion. - Watch this. There's a report that she sent you an autographed picture. Oh. (Laughs) You've written about that. Yes, it so happens I have it here. Look at this. (Jack laughs) Isn't that great? I know. Ms. Krull wanted me to get used to looking at her from this position. [Man] Any comment on that? Yes, I think Ms. Krull has a wonderful sense of humor, - among other things. - Yeah. - Well, I'd say. - I only hope she can keep smiling when they play-You dirty old man. "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the awards ceremony. [Goldine] (laughs) That's all I wanted you to see. - [Jack] It was great. - You looked really good. Oh, Jack, I loved it. You know, for the first time, I was talking to real people, people that wanted to know about me. It was fantastic. Yeah. Well, if you hadn't been in bed, I would never know you were ill. Well, hmm, it's nothing serious. I just, I have a sore throat and I'm thirsty all the time. I must've drank a gallon of water. Well, you really gave us a scare. I scared myself pretty good. It was funny, though, because you know what I thought about when I saw the triple fading away from me? What? I thought about you. - Really? Why? - Yeah. In San Diego, asking me, "Who are you? What do you want?" - And that helped? - Mm-hmm. - Well. - That, that and something else, something really weird. Because, you know, I was in a lot of pain. I was struggling. My legs hurt. And I looked over at Janie Canute, keeping me from third place, and all of a sudden, like a shot of adrenaline, and swept over me. You gotta take a win? No, I looked over at that sweet little girl, and I hated her. I hated her. It really shook me, you know, because I didn't wanna beat her anymore, I wanted to destroy her. And when I took her in that dip finish, oh, I relished it. (sighs) I know. It's really kinda ugly. Why? Is that the kind of person I really am? Listen, don't equate the killer instinct with knowing who you are. Oh, now you sound like Sammy. - Oh. - Yeah. So you're telling me that I'm basically a sweet little girl, and not mean at all. Listen, it's as natural to an athlete to wanna destroy her opponent as put on a pair of track shoes, that's all. Jack, you're so good for me. - Ah. - You are. I discovered something else out there today. Yeah? What? [Goldine] I still want you. Yeah, well, then I guess it's good that you've got a virus. (chuckles) Hmm, no, a virus isn't contagious. You'll have to come up with a better excuse than that. Well, I guess the one in San Diego was the one, and... Are you turning me down? Yes, with profound regret.

And if you're wondering how much we know, let's start by talking about PSH. For God's sake, Dryden. This is no time for a medical discussion. I'm her physician. I know what I'm doing. No, I want her to know what's wrong with her and why. Wait now, if this has to do with me, I wanna hear about it. Are you aware that you've been the basis for a case study to prove some theories that he holds? I've always known about his theory on oxygen intake. That you've been used as a Guinea pig. See, part of this Olympic idea was a stunt to publicize that people are growing taller. What, a stunt? Yeah, and for this stunt to work, his Guinea pig had to be 6'2". But I am 6'2". Yeah, but when you were growing up, he had no way of knowing you'd ever reach that height, and to prove his theories, it was essential. My dear friend, you're pulling this totally out of context. Wait, oh wait, oh wait now. Wait. Is that how I got to be as tall as I am? You planned it? The way he puts it makes it sound horrifying, my dear. Believe me, I didn't go into this lightly. I made the most intensive study of the use-You mean my height, like my nose and my body, isn't natural? Those shots that he gave you until you were 16 weren't for iron. They were a hormone that speeds up the growing process. (gasps) Is this true? [Bill] It's not a serious - as he puts it. - And Sammy. You went along with this? I just learned of it from Jack. I would never have allowed it. But you're in this place to get over a virus. See, those hormones can have a serious side effect. [Sammy] The sluggishness you've felt in your legs and the way you've been feeling ever since are all due to these injections. They've damaged your pancreatic cells. You know what that means, Goldine? You've become a diabetic. Right, Doctor? A diabetic? Oh, you had to, you had to know the risks. Oh, I was aware of it, but don't you understand? You did this to me for what? Please don't-I mean, why? - Darling. - Some one-line credit - in a medical encyclopedia? - It wasn't done to hurt you. Believe me, I love you. You know that. Yes, there was a risk, a very slight risk. But think of the compensation for that slight risk. The tremendous triumph at the Olympics. (Goldine laughs) Oh. Yeah. 15 years creating your 6'2" scientific truth, (laughs) And right before the big demonstration, it goes south because of some incurable disease. I find that incredible. Goldine, listen to me. Dryden's left out the most important part of the story. I didn't bring you in here to diagnose your condition, but to regulate it, to keep it under control. Are you telling me that it's not incurable? Your diabetes is mild. It's stabilized now. With proper diet and regular insulin, you can lead a completely normal life. And still compete in the Olympics? Why not? You won your place on the team. It is your right. Why give her false hope, goddammit? Haven't you done enough? No false hope, at all the trials, Goldine was suffering from insulin deficiency. With one injection, she could have set world records. That's why the 400 - was so tough. - Yes, of course. I couldn't tell you that. I could've won that race. Yes. You're the finest woman athlete in the world. You must go to Moscow. - Now, now, wait. - When can I start training? - Right away. - Wait a minute! Listen, she's already laid off almost a week. There's no Olympic athlete in the world that can lay off that long just before the games. You cannot compare Goldine with a normal Olympic athlete. Tell me, Bill, now. The pressure of the tryouts set this thing off. What do you think the Olympics will do? Doesn't she risk brain damage, or even worse? Not at all. Her blood sugar level will be monitored from race to race. Aha, and want the Russian scream drugs at the first blood sample? Insulin is not a prohibited drug, and diabetic athletes are not uncommon. I can clear it with the Olympic committee. I can tell them she's had this condition for two years. But now, you say she's stabilized, but if she's not, if you're lying and she runs, it could kill her. And why should we believe you? Because if anything happens to her, my entire life's work is meaningless. Your entire life's... All those years, you made me think those medals were for me. They are yours. They are yours. You still must go for gold. You were born a natural athlete. - You have to run. - Stop it. You have to run. I don't wanna hear those words anymore. Get outta here. Control your-Get outta here! Get out of here! Honey, sweetheart, why don't you lie down? I'll get Ingrid to give you a rubdown. No, no. Sammy? Mm-hmm? Sammy, help me. Help me get my things together. There's still time. I'll work out with Pete this afternoon. Are you crazy? Listen, we're, we're, we're, we're going to New York. Hey, Goldine, we'll find a specialist to find out if it's really stabilized or not. I've already missed a week. I can't waste any more time. Listen, will you talk with her? I think she's doing the right thing. She's a sick girl, dammit. - What's the matter with you? - Whatever you think of Bill Serafin, he is a fine physician. If he says the girl can function, I believe him. [Jack] Well, you're really something, that you're willing to sacrifice- - [Sammy] No, no, no, no, I'm not sacrificing- - Hey, wait a minute. [Jack] What the hell is it, then? You two, I'm perfectly capable of making up my own mind. Now, maybe before, Goldengirl wasn't supposed to think for herself, but that's all changing. I'm going to Moscow, I'm going to run, and God help anyone who tries to stop me. Even me? Yes, even you. [Operator] Your call is ready, sir. Hello? Franz, I'll call you right back. Well, I can't stop you. I know about the consortium, I put together the merchandising package, and I know that you haven't been a diabetic for the past two years. Now, look, Goldine, all I want you to do is to go to New York. I believe you really care. Yes, I care, dammit. I care very much. I love you. I love you. (somber music) Jesus Christ, Dryden. You'd say anything to keep me from running. Yeah, well, I just wanna keep my record straight. I've never had a dead athlete on my books before. Well, what's my alternative? A healthy freak? Oh, Jack, look at me. Everything about me is phony. And now even the insides are all screwed up. Is that any better? (dramatic music) [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of International Olympic Committee, I want to welcome you to Moscow for the 22nd Olympiad. (upbeat marching band music) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (presenter speaking Russian) [Gino] (laughs) Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? Listen to this. We have $8 million already committed, and nine million that will jump on the bandwagon after the first gold medal, and that's only domestic. [Michael] Mr. Dryden, we have to hand it to. You really know your business. [Gino] That broad may be diabetic, but she's sure getting to look sweet to me. [Noah] You know, Gino, you're a crude son of a bitch. - Oh, what do you know? - You know that? Jack, Jack, listen, you think you can make any more deals? I mean like Europe, the Orient, maybe the rest of the world? Sure. Whatever. (Indistinct) Hey, what's the matter with him? I expect he's not feeling too happy about Goldine's present condition. Oh, come on. For Christ's sake, I mean, you know, it's not a terminal disease. Yeah, well, the Olympic medical people, they're not idiots. They gave her a clean bill of health, didn't they? Because Serafin told them she'd had it for two years, that she's stabilized. Is it stabilized or isn't it? Yeah, man, what's the story? Listen, they've assigned a specialist to look after her throughout the games. Jack. - Steve. - Ahoy. It's good to see you. Welcome to Moscow. Say, isn't that the lady that you were with? Yeah, of course it is. Excuse me, lemme just say hello. Oh yes, that's right, you, um- - Hello. - Hello. - We met at the trials. - I hope you remember me. - Yes, yes. - How are you? - I'm glad to see you again. Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, I hope I'm not interrupting a meeting of the board of directors. No, not at all. This is Steve Esselton of TV's "Sports World." He likes to talk in riddles. Well, that's because you're so damned evasive, Jack. (Jack laughs) Uh, we still have some unpacking to do, don't we? Yes. Excuse us, Steve. You're still denying you have a stake in Goldine? Goldine who? I admit I was fishing at the trials, but I can prove the connection now. Would you care to hear it? Ah. Oh, see you in a while. Hell yes, a good laugh in Moscow's hard to come by. Well, the first time you brushed me, I found out you were staying at the Jacaranda Hotel, and I checked the guest list, and imagine who else was staying there? Messrs. Valenti and Cobb and Sternberg, and here you are together again in Moscow. That's quite a coincidence, Jack. Yeah, well, we're all rabid track fans. Listen, nice meeting you. - Really, terrific. - Pleasure indeed. I wasn't finished. Uh, yeah, later, later. The missing member of your group, he was also at the Jacaranda, Dick Armitage. Dick who? Never heard of him. Oh, Armitage I know. He's a client. Oh, thanks, Jack. I did a little research on Armitage. Found out that he had a bad tennis elbow just about two years ago. The doctor that helped him get rid of it was Dr. Serafin. Doctor who? Doctor who? Hell, you guys are really good. I think Dr. Serafin promoted the three of you plus Armitage to finance his daughter's training, and Armitage pulled in Dryden to merchandise the package. Any comment on that, gentlemen? (chuckles) Have you got any canceled checks or any copies of contracts to substantiate this fantasyless theory of yours? If you're looking for a good story, listen, listen, I handle this boxer whose brother's a fag. - He's wonderful. - No, wait, whoa, whoa. Just wait. Now, hold on just a second. Gentlemen, I'm not trying to get the girl banned. I'm not. I've already done several heavy features on her. I don't wanna junk "em. It's just, I have this little problem with this nonsense about the mystery super jogger blonde that never set foot on a track until the last few months. Come on, that's kinda rich. It's 1980. Look, if the Russians and the East Germans can use state dough to train their athletes, what's wrong with a few private businessmen, get together, make a little profit, train one of ours? What's wrong with that? Are you guys gonna level with me or what? I think you're absolutely right, Steve. And I'll tell you what I'll do. I'm gonna keep both my eyes and ears wide open. If I see or hear anything that I think you should know, I'll be able to pipe you immediately, okay? Jack, I'd like your help, but I don't need it. I'm bringing a guy over, kind of a guest commentator, and I'm counting on him to blow the whistle on all you birds. Really? Who would that be? Dr. Who, that's who. (crowd cheering) (announcer speaking in Russian) [Announcer] 100 meter women's semi-final heat number one. (starter speaks in Russian) (starter speaks in Russian) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) She's way back. It's just the angle. All she needs is a fourth to qualify. (crowd cheering) (announcer speaking in Russian) What is he going on about now? The star of the show is making her first appearance. This is Ursula Krull. (crowd chanting) You know, I heard last night that she's trying for the triple now. The East Germans have entered her in the 400, and she hasn't even trained for it. Well, naturally, you don't think they're gonna let us have a golden girl if they can have one of their own, do you? (starter speaks in Russian) (starter speaks in Russian) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) (announcer speaking in Russian) Christ. Now we're really in trouble. Goldine's best time has only been 11:04. (people speaking in Russian) (announcer speaking in Russian) [Announcer] 100-meter- - women's final. - Hello. Hello. I'm Ursula Krull. Oh yeah. So you are. That's only for the press. Good luck. How do you say that in German? Viel Glueck. Viel Glueck, then. Viel Glueck to you too. Danke schoen. Pete. Yeah? How are you feeling, man? Ah, how do I look? Terrible. Yeah, well, when you think that two hard years of work can get wiped out in a lousy 10-second race, how would you feel? Yeah, well, listen- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) (people cheering) (crowd cheering) Yes! Ooh, that's smooth. How do you feel now? It was never in doubt. (Jack laughs) (crowd cheering) [Announcer] New Olympic record. [Steve] Sir, I know it's been a long, long road. You must be the happiest and the proudest father in Lenin Stadium today. The folks back home would like to hear just how you feel about your daughter's incredible victory. Oh, quite credible for me. Without boasting, I knew she would win. She's unique, you see. Yeah, well, but you mean because of the special facilities that you've provided over the years? No, no, she's physiologically unique. Her skeletal development has been checked, corrected. Her what? Excuse me, sir. I don't follow. Her what? - Her skeletal development. - The configuration of her bones. If I may explain. Please, Doctor, trust me, the folks at home would rather hear how you feel right now. How I feel? Aren't you jumping over the Moon? I beg your pardon? Well, uh, excited, proud, ecstatic, something. Oh yes, there is an element of satisfaction, yes. An element of satisfaction. Thank you, Dr. Serafin, for the quote of the year. Please, you didn't let me finish. Steve Esselton returning you to Dave Yardley in New York. I would like to explain- what the configuration-No, please don't. Of the bones mean. Thank you. - Hi, Goldine. - Jack! This is a restricted area. Who the hell are you? - I'd like to see Ms. - Serafin for a few minutes. Sorry, I can't allow that. - Nurse! - No, Doctor, please. This is a medical examination. - It's quite important. - Yeah, but he's a very close friend of mine. Come on, you know the rules. Please. - Hold that. - Oh, thank you. Thank you, Doctor - Jack. I've missed you. You haven't been to see me since you got to Moscow. Yeah, well, there's a reason. Oh, like what? Like Steve Esselton, that TV guy. Yeah? Bad news if he saw us together. And he's got the knife out. He doesn't believe our background story. Is that what you came to talk to me about? No, there's more. He brought your father over here. He's not my father. You know that. Yeah, well, to the media, that's just a technicality. Now, he may try to lay on an interview with the two of you. Oh, he can just go jump. I'm not going anywhere near that. Okay, okay, just make some kind of an excuse. You've got to train, or something. But if he talks about your father- - But-But wait. Remember the image we created. - Jesus Christ! - Say something nice. Jack, I don't believe you. I just won a gold medal, and all you can talk about is that megalomaniac. Excuse me, I'm putting these glucose tablets-You're really sweating it. - In your tracksuit pocket. - Aren't you, Jack? - Don't forget to take 'em. - Okay, okay. For you I will play the devoted daughter routine, but only if you'll just- - Hey. You're not listening to me. What? You make damn sure you take two of these before each race, because if you don't, you can go into shock - in 30 seconds. - Okay, all right. And if you don't, you can be dead in two or three minutes. - Do you understand that? - Yes, I do. Just put 'em in my jacket, okay, please? Thank you. You were saying that you'd play the devoted daughter if I want it? Yeah, Jack. I just set a new Olympic record. Don't I even deserve a kiss? Yeah, you were terrific out there. I'm sorry. Oh no, no, no. Not on the lips. - Hmm? - No. The feet, Jack. You can kiss my feet. Oh, yeah, right. [Goldine] You owe one hell of a lot to them. Come on, kiss 'em. Kiss, kiss, come on. Kiss 'em! (Laughs) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) I don't want to. Now, I don't care if she's the best damn ice skater in the world. No, I've had it with female athletes. Yeah, well, tell her the truth. Tell her that I'm a totally dedicated male chauvinist pig, and gonna stay that way, got it? Okay, now, about Serafin. I'm afraid we're just gonna have to live with that one. Esselton's taping an interview with him tomorrow morning at, well, just before the games. Yeah, well, there's nothing I can do about it, short of murder. What about Hartwig? What did he have to say? Oh, come on Franz. Get your notes, will ya? You know, it's costing a lot of money. Oh, my, my, my, look at her. America's sweetheart. Every mother would like her for a daughter and every father would like to take her to bed. Listen, Jack, what happened between Goldine and you yesterday may have nothing to do with her condition. After all, a gold medal winner may be entitled to a little display of temperament. Yeah, well, I hope so. (crowd cheering) ("Star-Spangled Banner") Yeah, what? Yeah, I'm here, Franz. Yeah. He said what? Well, okay. Give him my regards. And thank you. Well. That kind of shoots your temperament bullshit theory all to hell. Why? Well, according to Dr. Hartwig, extreme irritability and irrational behavior are strong indications that there is an imbalance in her blood sugar level. That means she's not stabilized. Yes. Well, don't you think the team doctor would've diagnosed that? (Crowd cheering) Yeah, sure he should have, right? Patriotism, I guess. She's running for the flag now, not just for the gold. Patriotism blinds a lotta people. Even some doctors. Ta-daa! (Goldine laughs) Let me see. Let me see. Look at this. Oh, wow. Isn't she pretty? That is probably the closest I'll ever get to one. Ah, come on. You still have a shot at the 200 and the relay. Yeah, maybe the relays, 'cause that's the only event you and Krull aren't in. (Goldine chuckles) There you go, my little Moscow bear. You take care of that for me. Hey, did you leave me some hot water? [Debbie] Are we in Moscow? I hope so. (bathroom door slams) Deb, Deb, have you seen my shower cap? If it's not in the bathroom, I don't know where it is. Maybe it's on the dresser, where you left it. Of course, right where I left it. You're right. Huh. (Tense music) Debbie, did you touch my medal? Your medal? Yeah. You tried to put it on, didn't ya? No, I didn't try to put it on. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. What the hell's wrong with you? Yeah, I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to take away my power. (scoffs) Goldine, you- - Goldengirl. It's Goldengirl. You call me Goldengirl when you talk to me. I never touched your medal. You're a liar. You are a liar. And I can't stand lying, and I won't share my room with any liar. Now you get the hell outta here. And then she tells the team manager that she's not gonna set foot on the track again if she has to share a room with another second-rate hacker. [Jack] who she's staying with now? The US ambassador. - The US ambassador? - They moved her - to the embassy. - You're kidding. I mean, Jack, this diabetic thing is turning her into a schizophrenic. I'm worried. Those damn security regulations. I should be out there with her. Can't we talk to the doctor at least? I can arrange something. Let's go to the stadium. I'll get the car. Look, the girl has been examined thoroughly. Nurse, gimme that vial. Her blood level is normal, right? Her urine analysis is normal. Now, what are you trying to do? Get the girl kicked out of the games? No, I'm fond of the girl, and I just don't want her health impaired, that's all. Are you sure it doesn't have anything to do with that scene that I witnessed yesterday? (indistinct) Did that strike you as normal behavior, for Christ's sake? I don't know what goes on between you two. She told me that you hadn't come to see her since you came to Moscow, and she was steamed up about that. Steamed up about it? That was a hell of a lot more than steamed up. That was weird, man. Oh, maybe, but I don't know all the things that go into abnormal behavior, but Olympic pressure is one of them. And can't the same pressure aggravate a recent case of diabetes? Are you trying to tell me my job as a doctor? No, we just want to make sure that she has the best-Will you do me a favor? Would you tell me what your connection with that girl is? Well, I'm a very old friend. I've known her for a very long time. Good. Okay, old friend. I've got some news for you. See this case history? It's hers. It says here that she's had that disease for two years. She signed it and her father signed it, and he's a doctor, too. But she hasn't had it for two years. They signed that so that you wouldn't disqualify her in the States. They knew damn well you couldn't accept a recent diabetic. And you want me to accept that flimsy explanation? Now, listen, you two. The whole country is steamed up about this girl. The president is calling her personally if she pulls off that triple tomorrow. Now, as long as her blood and urine are normal, she runs, get it? Now, goodbye. And when did you discover that Goldine had this superlative speed? Not merely speed. A superlative physique. (telephone ringing) It was obvious as a child. You mean that early you decided to turn her into an Olympic runner? I wish you wouldn't single out her running abilities. She would excel at any sport with proper instruction. The Sheldon classification rates her as a mesomorph, in spite her unusual height. Well, I'm sure, but tell me, surely, with private tutors in the home, and her own gym, and now recently a professional coach to train her, hasn't this been a heavy personal investment for you? I have invested in Goldine's health, in her physical development. Surely you were aware of the fantastic potential rewards if she made her mark at the Olympics. My reward is proving a scientific fact. You mean she's running to publicize some theory of yours? My investigations in human growth. Goldine is the living answer to my critics. She's taller about four inches than any normal growth would have achieved. Well, that's very interesting, Doctor, but what has it got to do with the Olympics? Goldine is the fastest girl in the world because - I brought her up this way. - Because a lot of money has been spent on her training, money put up by a group of successful businessmen who expect to reap a bonanza if she pulls off a triple this afternoon, right or wrong? No! Goldine runs for the love of sport. She's the prototype of a generation yet unborn. Let me put it to you another way, Doctor. Would you deny that you have had conversations with a famous American agent who's prepared to put your daughter on the commercial circuit as soon as these games are finished? Conversations? A man has many conversations. - Answer the question. - I am proving - a scientific effect. - Please. I insist I be allowed to finish. The human frame can withstand an increase in height. With induced growth and proper nutrition, we will assist evolution. We will reshape the human race, create superior people. And Goldine is my proof. Roy, cut tape. - This isn't working. - She's the forerunner - of a new breed. - Get him outta here. - Excuse me, sir. - Let's go. She's not brittle-boned. Yeah, give me the (indistinct) van, please. (announcer speaking in Russian) - [Noah] She's got a break. - Krull's drawn the inside. There is no such thing as a break at this level of competition. [Announcer] Lane one, Krull, DDR. Lane two, Burnard, Jamaica. Lane three, Bauke, DDR. Lane four, Serafin, USA. Lane five, Ighodaro, Nigeria. She's taking something. Is that allowed? It's all right. It's her glucose. Lane seven, Jackson, USA. (Whistle blows) Lane eight, El Sharif, United Arab Emirates. (starter speaks in Russian) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) (camera shutter clicks) (crowd cheering) (announcer speaking in Russian) (crowd cheering) Congratulations. You surprised me. Ah, I surprise a lot of people, I think. Come. (crowd cheering) Oh, that stupid girl. What does she think she's doing? She ought to be conserving her strength. [Reporter] Her second gold medal. Now the question is, can America's golden girl win the 400 meters as well and become the first woman in history to win three gold medals in the sprint events? Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Hey, Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Hey, Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! Goldine! - What's going on? - It's Serafin. Goldine! Goldine! You have to tell 'em at the press conference, you have to tell 'em that I've created you. You are my triumph. You must tell 'em. You owe that to me! Hey, Steve, take a look. What the hell is he doing? - Who is that? - Goldine! I don't know. Just some crazy old man. Please, Goldine! Goldine! Come on. You must tell the world that I created you! (crowd cheering) Oh, go away. You have to, Goldine! I think I'd better go down there. He's going to need me. Bernie, stay on him all the way. Everybody, stay on him. He just made that lousy interview work for us. Rack a freako, sweetheart. (crowd cheering) (siren blaring) (reporter speaking in Russian) (announcer speaking in Russian) [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, it is time now for 400-meters women's final. Lane one, Smith, Canada. Lane two, Serafin, USA. Lane three, Lopee, Colombia. Lane four, Schwab, Mexico. Lane five, Lupinski, Poland. Lemme see those glasses. What's going on now? Why, what's wrong? She forgot to take her glucose. [Announcer] Du Bois, France. No, it's gonna be okay. She got 'em. (starter speaks in Russian) (ominous music) Holy shit! - What? - Look. (starter speaks in Russian) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) (suspenseful music) (dreamy music) (suspenseful music) (dreamy music) (suspenseful music) (dreamy music) (suspenseful music) (dreamy music) (suspenseful music) [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, triple gold medal winner, Ms. Goldine Serafin. (audience applauding) You know all the answers, so enjoy yourself, but listen before you talk, and remember, a nice message to the folks back home. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please excuse me for being so late. I know I'm supposed to be a sprinter, but as you can see, I'm carrying a heavy handicap. - (audience laughing) - Ms. Serafin, Can you explain your collapse at the end of the 400 final? Oh, nerves, tension, and I don't like facing a group of photographers unless I look my best. [Woman] Ms. Serafin, is it an advantage - to be as tall as you are? - Goldine, you are the fastest sprinter in the whole world. [Goldine] Well, thank you. [Man] How do you account for your speed? [Goldine] Well, I'll let you in on my secret. You see, gunshots scare the hell outta me. Did you feel it was possible to win three gold medals before the race? Oh, I still can't believe that it's actually happened, but at the risk of sounding conceited, I didn't come to Moscow-This is marvelous. - To lose. - You think so too? Oh, this is a great moment. Three cheers for behavior modification. - Mm. - Congratulations, Sammy. Thank you. She's all yours. I wish there was some way that I could show them how much I appreciate it. Unfortunately, the only words I know in Russian are "nastat" and "vanimaniya". (audience laughing) [Man] Ms. Serafin, in your upcoming plans, will you remain in track, or pursue the commercial opportunities available to you? Well, I do love running. I know that. And as far as commerce is concerned, I don't know a great deal about that. You see, reading the "Wall Street Journal" isn't really my scene. Oh dear. What magazine do you represent? (audience laughing) [Woman] In all the stories written about you, there's never any mention of romance. Is there any special man in your life? Yes. (soft music) Um... Yeah. Yes, there is. I haven't met him yet, but when I do, he'll be someone I can look up to, if you know what I mean. (audience laughing) Goldine, Goldine, in all the races you have won, did it ever enter your mind that you might lose? Lose? Well, "lose" is a four-letter word, and I don't use those.
