Subtitle oleh: ~ WarnetPandan-Net .. ~ In B.E. 2483, the nation descended into a dark age. People struggled with great adversity. The bureaucracy was corrupt. Rumors about the next world war and Japan's plans for invasion had people living in terror. The government continued its nationalist propaganda while the whole country was falling apart. All hell was breaking loose. Failed by legal systems, the oppressed chose the life of banditry. New cliques and gangs emerged. Criminals could be found everywhere. One of the most notorious outlaws was an ethnic separatist named Alhawi Yalu. Master of sorcery. Local people called him the devil of Budo mountain. Police Lt. Khun Puntharak Rajjadej, I called you here today because I wanted to ask you a favor regarding the Budo mountain case. Alhawi Yalu is getting more powerful. He almost has the whole mountain area under control. I want to send you undercover for half a year. Once the new inspector arrives, your job is done. You understand the conditions? Yes, sir. Since it's a secret mission, no backup. This means... I may not come back. Criminals are everywhere and yet we can't bring them to justice. This is our fate now. We can't tell what will happen next or who we will become. Do you think you can change that? BUDO MOUNTAIN Alhawi's army spreads out across the region. His left and right-hand men, also with great knowledge of sorcery, are as dangerous as their master. Suea Sang... SUEA SANG ...and Suea Grub Kamtong. SUEA GRUB KAMTONG May 11, B.E. 2483, my unit, led by Inspector Issara, was going to dismantle Suea Grub Kamtong's gang. Instead, we were surrounded by his henchmen. Inspector Issara was shot. Inspector, let me see. Dammit! Aren't they tired of firing? Hey! Hey! Stop! This is the police! Come out! We have you surrounded. Am I going to see my child? I still don't know what to name him. Any ideas? Name? What about Joy? -Joy? -Hey, it's a good name. Enough with that! I need cigarettes. Hey! Do you have some? -This is the last pack. -Throw it over. Ugh, what a terrible throw! -Go get it. -Yes, sir. Cover me! Cover me! Go help him. I'll cover you. Go! Deputy, they're coming in closer. They intend to block us in. We're not gonna make it. Look! Kids over there. I'll cover. You go help them. I'll go. You cover me. Noon! We just want Khun Pun. -Come out, or I'll kill them all. -Lieutenant, you heard him. If you don't go out, we'll die. That's me. Khun Pun. YANTRA TATTOOS Noon! Noon! Fire in the hole! I take refuge in Buddha. I take refuge in Dharma. I take refuge in Sangha. Bless me with the power of the mind. What should we do? They got the inspector. How many bullets? -I have four. -I have three. All right then. I'm going to help him. I'll run towards them. You follow my signals and shoot. -Understood? -Yes, sir! -Lieutenant, stop right there! -One more step, I'll blow his brains out. Bullets were flying everywhere. I lost many officers. At that point, I thought I had to surrender myself. He had a gun pointed to my head. He was going to pull the trigger. What were you thinking? I could have been killed! This hurts so damn much. Inspector Issara was praised for taking down Suea Grub's gang. He pulled enough strings to get promoted and got sent back to Bangkok. Meanwhile, I'm on my way to meet him. Alhawi Yalu. Beards that turn to copper and livers that turn to iron. Things like these are very powerful, and can only be in the possession of true masters, the perfected ones. How did you get them? None of your business. There's still a tooth in the roof of the mouth to complete the sacred trinity. Venerable sir, did you know I ordered my men to dig up your past? I know that you were a cop. The one thing I don't have yet, it's in your mouth. People who know sorcery can still be killed by a lance, right? So... your tooth, just let me have it. I've been thinking over and over about running for election. -Well, I'm interested. -If you do, I'm sure you can win. You don't have to worry at all. As long as you ignore what's going on regarding our opium trade. Sir, are you trying to bribe a government official? L... Luang, sir... Luang, sir, by the way, I heard that they're sending the new inspector general to station here. I'm afraid-- You know this is a remote area. Who would bother inspecting anything? It's full of bandits and criminals. PUBLIC SECURITY POLICE Hey! On September 13, Luang Phadej, the newly assigned inspector was attacked by Alhawi's guerrillas. Almost the whole unit was killed. Only two could make it out. Come and hear me, The story of our hometown... I was trying to reach out to the two officers but to no avail. I have no idea what happened to them or what's going to happen to me. My guess is that the government loses credibility and way too much money for this. There will be no reinforcements after the attack. I'm on my own. Nobody gives a damn about this town. Nobody wants to come near a place where everyone is an outlaw. I will withdraw from this mission if I can answer this for myself: what made them choose to be criminals and what made me choose to be a policeman? I guess Mali likes you, But. Amidst the sea, I watch the moon at night. It reminds me of my love who is far away. Did my horse scare off your fish? No, sir. Even if your horse comes down to the pond, the fish won't take the bait. There's just small fish in this pond. But master, I heard that there's this giant fish in here. Goatherder, you plan to catch a giant fish with this tiny hook? I just want to see it. Even if I have to dive, I'd do it. Every part of the Budo mountain range is under my protection. But go on. You are allowed to catch some fish. This is my bet. If you can catch a big fish with that tiny hook of yours, you can keep it. But if you can't, the next time I see you, I'm gonna need that back. Yes, master. SUB-DISTRICT KUANLAY POLICE STATION Let's go! -Inspector! -What's going on? Mr. Oo told the police that Kheaw and Samae abducted and raped his daughter. I chased after them and brought them here, sir. Hey! How much have you got? -Two baht. -You? Five baht. Hand it over. Here, Inspector. So broke. Keep the money. It's a reparation. You can go home now. Inspector, how can you do that? Bang, lock him up until he calms down. Bang! I'm an officer! The suspects are standing right there! Bang! Who do you think you are? Phueak. Those two work for the Ivory Club. Luang Olan's men. If we arrest them, Mr. Oo's family won't be alive tomorrow. Do you understand? Remember, you work for me now. Do as I say. No questions asked. I'm going to keep your payments for two months. That's a hundred baht for an acceptance fee. I'll introduce you as my distant relative. Don't tell anyone you're not from around here. Just keep quiet. Especially with the locals. Stay in your lane. Understand? Keep your head down, your mouth shut. Otherwise, you're gonna get killed. That's it. Oh, let's push. Good. You have to pay me for this. Another month of your payment. Go away! Go away! Shoo! Please, Monsieur le Consul. I am so honored. Hello, Mr. Paul. This is monsieur Jean Pierre, the consul of France. Thank you for your invitation, Mr. Olan. You are such a great host. Do you know anything about the spies in Thailand? There're plenty of boats in the Gulf of Thailand. Most of them belong to the Chinese, not the Japanese. I take it you're exhausted from the long journey. I've prepared some pretty masseuses for you. -You take such a good care of me. Cheers. -Cheers. You have a lighter? You can keep it. Thanks. Wow! But! You look so handsome in this uniform. -Khaitoh took you to work then? -Yes. Let's go to the club. I'm about to go on stage. Want to watch? -I don't think I can do that. -It's all right. Come with me. The show is about to begin. The moon shines bright On the shore at night Lights up the sky How beautiful Cool breezes whisper as river flows The soft sounds wander Under the moonlight Hear the birds sing Deep in the woods Whose song is this? Oh, it belongs To the night birds and cicadas Happily they perform Sweet smells the wind brings From flowers as the birds sing Their song helps me remind myself That love awaits The moon shines bright On the shore at night What will happen next I don't know You did a wonderful job tonight. You don't have to say that. Why wouldn't I? Why did they do it? Don't you know? His rice fields were seized. Those two rascals from the club raped Hong, his daughter. Hong was dead, so Luea hung herself. Take them to the temple. Tell me right now. No way! I found them in a canal. They haven't said a word. I am Alhawi Yalu. Alhawi Yalu. Do you know the meaning? That you're a criminal. My name means a deep dark endless abyss. Whoever falls down there will never come back up. Now tell me what you were planning on doing here? I'm not telling you! Die! Sergeant! Sergeant! What are you doing? No! Sergeant! Sergeant! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! We were ordered to find an officer sent to infiltrate here. He was the one who killed Suea Grub Kamtong. His name was Khun Pun. -Khun Pun. -Please don't kill me. You. This Khun Pun is immortal. He's gonna cut all your heads off. What is it? I want 20 bags of rice, 20 cows and 10 buffaloes. Send them to my father and tell him that, "I still want to serve you.‚Äù You came here for this? I have presents for you. Behind the couch. What the fuck is this? -They were undercover cops. -Why did you bring them here? There's still another. Hang their bodies in town. This means war. I want you to help me find him. Bring him in alive. Let me be invisible. Yes? Oh, good evening, inspector. We got a report about a criminal infiltrating into our area. We are doing a house search. Who is this? He's my relative from Punpin. Father's dead, mother's sick. So I took him to work with me at the club. Thanks everyone for your cooperation. You. Get an umbrella and walk me outside. Tell me who you are... or I'll shoot! I'm Police Lt. Khun Puntharak Rajjadej, assigned by the government to disband the bandits here. I suggest you get out of here soon. There's a thing about this town. Authorities are in the wrong. If you're hunting for them, they're hunting for you. Trust me. If you want to live, leave this town. This is all I can help you with. Let's go. Bird battle field was created to entertain important guests and is run by Suea Sang. What I gathered from there was that Alhawi's father is still alive. The best way I can learn about the devil is from his own father. It's all my fault. Alhawi is a result of my own karma. I once was a bandit, a murderer. Alhawi idolized me, wanted to follow my footsteps. You know, the name Raya Gaji has a special meaning. It means someone who's small but a dangerous fighter. I want to be as great as Raya Gaji. -Can I be Raya Gaji as well? -Of course you can. Then I was arrested. I wanted to wash the blood off my hands. But you can never get away from it. You never feel clean. Once a thief, always a thief. I remember the look in his eyes, the look of someone who had no faith left, especially in myself, his own father. Raya Gaji, my son. Hey, Malai. Where's your dress? You wanted to see me? I know you are a cop. I saw you paying respect to those two cops. I'm so sorry. Malai! Go! Let's go! You got some magic up your sleeve too, huh? Do you know why I hate the police so much? Because you people are evil leeches! Let's go! Hello, sir! This man is not a consul but a spy from France. I want you to make sure that no one gets in the way of the Imperial Army. You can tell your men to get drunk and wait for the good news. I heard your troops have arrived on Vietnam's coast, right? I have something for you, Malai. What's the occasion? It seems to me that you're the French consul's favorite. Inside the bezel there is a potion. Slip it into his drink. Get it done, and I'll forgive every single baht of your brother's debt. And this... is for my affection for you. Now get out. Why do you want him dead? He's an opportunist. I'll take care of him. Not by force. People will notice. I don't want to draw attention to me. Master, if the trains arrive as you said, everyone will have a better life, right? Of course. The economy will prosper. People won't be in debt. You won't have to plunder. So if I ask you if there are many Japanese around here... I'd rather have a whisky. Fuck... What's happening to me? Fuck... Thanks, Bu-nga. If I find out you're in debt again and have Malai pay it off for you, I'll slit your throat. Malai. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. At least we're not in debt anymore. Who's inside? Come on out! -Hurry! -Let's go. Hurry! But! This man, But, is Khun Puntarak Rajjadej. He was appointed to station here as the new inspector. All right, then. However, we have to hide him for now. We'll talk later when he's conscious. Everyone please take care of him. We have got to go. Khaitoh, But is a cop? Why didn't you tell us? You want us to die? -Yeah, right? -If Suea Sang knows that you've been hiding a cop, -what's going to happen? -You know that -they won't let us get away with this. -Yeah. Yeah. Take him. Drop him at the club. Glum, do it. Come on! Go! Move! -Stop! Stop! -Hey! Stop him! -Khaitoh! -You think a person like me would want to get us into trouble? And the fact that he's a cop, I just found out too. Khaitoh. You can talk all you want. Aren't you the one who sold your sister to settle your debt? You're lucky they haven't blown your brains out yet. Oh, you think I'm the only one who borrows from him? Everyone in this village is in debt. I don't want anyone to trade off their lives for Luang Olan. Back then, no matter how tired, we'd go to sea. Look at us these days. Now, the sea's right next to us but we turn to him to ask for his money. When you feel better, do something for me. Get out of here... or many people will die because of you. Then why did you help me? I've seen many good cops sent here to die. You might not make it again. You can only run for so long. You only have one job. Nobody new gets in. Is that too much to ask? Answer me! Can you do that? I, Khun Puntarak Rajjadej, carry out an official order to suspend Luang Olan for the murder of the Inspector General and for criminal association. You will be placed under suspension immediately. Do you have any proof before throwing accusations at me? Never mind. I'm a law-abiding citizen anyway. Here's the deal. Let's make a bet over the next three days whether you find any evidence or if you become a dead body. They said that Khun Pun was very powerful. He knew his way around sorcery just like Alhawi Yalu. They also said that the criminals he captured, he cut all their heads off. Then this Khun Pun, he placed those heads under each flight of his stairs so he could step on them every day. Some of the skulls were made into ashtrays to confine their spirits. -True stories. -Is he really a cop? I don't care if he's a real cop. You can't just let him go. If you promise to quit being a criminal and to enter the monkhood, I promise I'll capture you alive. Tell every single one of them to come to me and sign their names, and I will capture them alive. I think this Khun is out of his mind. Don't you think? Who will show up to register? You're still trying to catch the big fish with a tiny hook, goatherder? Here's your money. I'd like to make another bet that I can catch the big fish. Long ago, there was a boy who thought like you. The boy lived here with that big fish. It made him think that it was his. And then one day, law enforcement like yourself brought this thing called justice. The boy learned that the big fish was no longer his. Remember me. My name is Alhawi Yalu. Alhawi Yalu. I understand why you did it. Kamnan Jun is crooked. That's why I sent you a message that all of them were here. As long as I'm still alive, they have no reason to send new people here. We can work together to make this town a better place. Comfort and well-being are only for the ruling class. What are you trying to do, master? Trying to uphold justice, master? I am the justice! What you do... is against the law. Between you and I, the difference is the uniform. This place can exist without you! I don't think anyone will show up today. I suggest that we call it a day. Why? -They want to be outlaws so bad? -Khun Pun! -Khun Pun! Bad news! -What's going on? We just learned that Alhawi Yalu knows that Khaitoh's village saved your life. They're heading there right now. What should we do, sir? -Is that true? -Yes, sir. Hey! Hurry! Go to the village! Tell everyone in the village. From now on, they owe me their lives. Suea Sang, do you know why I invited you here? No. To be honest, you're more than capable, perhaps a lot more than Alhawi even. Why be just a follower? Hear me out. From now on, you take orders from me directly. What do you say? All right. Sir. Welcome to the civil world. This is mother turtle's home. Mother turtle has three eggs. Father turtle's walking out. I think I'm going to write a song. What is it about? About little Mali and Malai, my sister. Little Mali flowers braided into beautiful Malai. Make it beautiful. Of course. That's my specialty. Mali! Mali! Mali! Here is mother turtle. Brother, come play with me? Mother turtle will lay eggs here. Damn. We were too late. -Bang. -Yes? -Phueak, gather the bodies. -Yes, sir. Do it now. Inspector! This one's still alive. Suea Sang attacked us. Khaitoh and some villagers fled to the jungle. Tuan! Khun Pun. Khun Pun. In the morning, the tide is highest. If we sail along the mountain, we can arrive on the shore without worrying about the sandbar. Yes, sir! Admiral, sir! Send my message to the Army. Tell them to prepare for landings. Tomorrow our Imperial Japanese Army will prove our greatness and conquer this land. -Yes, sir! Admiral, sir! -Yes, sir! Admiral, sir! -Hello. -Hello. What's the progress with our trains? About our trains, what's the progress? Tell him the trains will arrive tomorrow. Everything is going as planned. Just don't forget to keep your end of the bargain. The trains will arrive here tomorrow. Everything is in progress just as you ordered. You just keep your end of the bargain like we agreed. We have plenty of gold. Don't you worry. Well, I have to worry about my 20%. Your country... is so cheap for us to buy. -Sir? -Glum, Malai, come out now. How's the village? We have to go through the jungle. Once we reach the border, we'll find the main railroad. There should be passing trains. By that time, we should be safe. Come on now. Let's go. Careful. -Watch your step. It's slippery. -Careful. Wait! You have to hurry. Suea Sang is coming. Go! Bu-nga, come with us. This is all I can do for you, Malai. Take care. Malai! Malai! Come on! Hurry! Come on now! Let's go! Hurry! Come on! Come on! Promise me that Mali didn't die in vain. I promise. -Inspector. -Yes, sir. When the trains arrive in Ampoe, everyone should be safe. I will go back to town. Take care of them. Sir, how can you be an inspector without subordinates? -I'm going with you. -Me too. Me too. It's Suea Sang, sir. Kill them all! Sir, can you please tell me the marks? Two o'clock. Four o'clock. Get out of the way! Go! Hurry! We surrender! -Don't shoot. -Get down! Put the guns down. Khun Pun! -Khun Pun! -But! But! No! No! Serve me as your master. Get down! Hey! What happened? Who did this? Suea Sang. He took his people to kill the villagers. How could he? It wasn't my order! The soldiers on the train were all Japanese. Khun Pun. I can only come with you this far. I'm going with you. Master, you made me a promise. Alhawi. You betrayed me. Alhawi. Where are you? You... didn't do it for everyone like you promised. Alhawi. It's just a little misunderstanding. Suea Sang turned against me because of you! Because you failed to kill Khun Pun, you left me with no choice! Alhawi, sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good. Luang! You are a bloodsucker! -Go! -Get out of here. Come this way. Come on! Go! Go! Go! What's going on here? You snake! Are you on our side or what? Listen, I can explain. I'm out of ammo. Fall back! Come on! Run! Hurry! Come here! Inspector! Inspector! Get down! Malai... No! Malai! -Phueak, cover me! -Yes, sir! If you promise to quit being a criminal, I'll take you alive. What about you? Do you still want to catch that big fish? Both of us... are wasting time fighting each other. Give yourself up, Alhawi. Luang Olan manipulated and used you. I'll be your witness in court. Two hundred people. I have killed two hundred people. Most of them were cops. And you? How many have you killed? Bet it's no less than mine. Right? We have both been used. We are both going to hell. You should just be yourself. Admit it, you're dying to cut off my head. Come and take your future... in exchange for your heart... that I'll gouge out with my bare hands. Right. Perhaps you and I, we're not so different after all, Alhawi. Raya Gaji, another name of Alhawi? He's a legendary fighter... who never lost his faith. Young man, I can see the spirit of Raya Gaji within you. Please bring my son back from the endless abyss. Alhawi's weakness... is his heart. Raya Gaji. Raya Gaji, my son. Vinyan SampannoItipiso Bhagava Namo Budhaya. I set you free. I set you free. I set you free. I set you free. Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Kimi Ga yo wa Chiyo ni Yachiyo ni Sazare ishi no... I still remember what Luang Adul said before I took this mission. He asked me... if I thought I could make a change. I don't have an answer for him. All I know is if we don't have faith in our country... -Long live the Emperor! -...we have nothing left... Long live the Emperor! ...and we should have enough courage -to protect it. -Banzai! Banzai! If you promise to quit being a criminal and to enter the monkhood, I'll capture you alive, Suea Bai.
