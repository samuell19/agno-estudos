You, too... Conducting through hypnosis, can it be done? May I get by? I'm sorry This way Good morning Thanks There's that sweet face Murakami makes when he's grateful It's soooo cute Doesn't it feel calculated? Like he's making a studied effort - You think? - Definitely I'm so full Me, too. The portions are huge Murakami's new team is up on the 42nd floor, right? The girl he chose to join them, quit The one who took all that vacation? It was terrible timing, a real nuisance Blew her one shot at a great job What a waste! So Murakami's looking to get someone else on board One of us, perhaps? He surrounds himself with favorites - Maybe try on the glass slipper? - Shut up! "Fortune Land"? What's that? It's the boss. Run Fortune Land What's this? Miss Suzuki, do you have a minute? Can you put together the materials for our big presentation? You mean right away? I want us all working from the same documents.

I'll email you later I'm counting on you. Thanks Great... Mom & Dad What do you want? Hello, Shizuka? You didn't come see us for ages. How is everything? It's not far, drop by sometime Look, no news is good news. Why are you calling? Do I have to have a reason? Listen, do you think you raised yourself? We footed your bills all the way up to graduation Hello? Are you there? Hello, Sis? I've got a reunion party near you tomorrow Can you look after my daughter for the day? What about Mom and Dad? Didn't she tell you? That was the reason she called They're just going on a trip Heck, I really don't want to I heard that. What's wrong with you? You always did everything you wanted, the singing, the ballet, all thanks to us I mean, in the end it worked out. You studied hard and got a good job but... Next, Shizuka Suzuki Votes for the Lead Role Shizuka Suzuki Are we all agreed that Shizuka plays the lead role? Next is the 5th grade musical, "The Kids' Island" Shizuka, here's the mic Ouch... Yes? Hi. Open up Hey there, Winner Don't call me that I'm so jealous Me, the sad, single mother divorcee... Things are so much smarter in the big city... Really?

Mr. Murakami, here's the file Done at last! Want to go see a movie? "Fortune Land" Free Admission We'll get in for free You like musicals? I have to be in one at school Is that still going on? I was forced to do it, too So...you went to my school? But I never really enjoyed that kind of stuff Me, neither Right? Don't you think musicals are odd? People singing right out of the blue It's crazy. Like they're mentally unstable Musicals are for idiots Fortune Land Let's go Don't run off, you'll get lost Tarot Reader: 1,200 yen Heck, there's nothing free about this place Hypnosis is neither magic nor the supernatural... "Martyn Ueda's House of Hypnosis" "Only 500 yen" What a scam You're going in? I'll pay Haven't I seen that face before? I married into an onion farmer's family But I hate onions Okay, I understand When I count to three... That onion's going to be a sweet, sweet apple One of your favorite foods You're right! It's so deliciously sweet! It's really good! My mother-in-law won't harass me any more That's amazing Thank you so much 500 yen's too little. Please accept this There's no need. 5,000 is way too much - Please, I insist - You really shouldn't Thank you so, so much The pleasure was mine Sorry for the wait. Come this way Take a seat, please I hand these out to my first-timers It's called The Ring of Truth It reveals your aura. Let me help... There you go - It's fantastic - Glad you like it Normally 2,000 yen each But today I'll make it 3,000 for 2, okay? Another cost? You're at the doorway to the world of hypnosis See how the ring won't come off? You're right Is that glue? So, what kind of hypnosis interests you? There are several kinds To return to infancy there's "regressive hypnosis" To like any kind of food we have "palate mastery" - To change the way you are... - That one! Which? I want to be good in the musical I'm so behind in rehearsal and I want to prove myself. I totally understand In that case... Take a look at this Okay, focus right in the center, please You've arrived in the world of hypnosis From tomorrow you'll feel like you're the star of the musical Why not today? When you hear music, you can't help but to sing and to dance Sorry... Message: Ryosuke Murakami It's Murakami. Thank you for a great job on those documents I'd like it if you could attend tomorrow's meeting, too Meet me in the conference room at 10am This ring's useless No throwing. What's wrong with it? 100 yen store junk? It's nothing You're quite something... What do you mean? Joining such a prestigious company I worked my butt off You're not overdoing it? Not at all We'll miss our bus Bye, then. It's not far so come home sometimes - See you - Bye It's Murakami. Thank you for a great job on those documents I'd like it if you could attend tomorrow's meeting, too Meet me in the conference room at 10am From tomorrow you'll feel like you're a musical star When you hear music, you can't help but to sing and to dance Miss, are you getting on? Yes... Hold tight Good morning - What's going on? - Don't tell me... The first page of our website tells the world who we are Design-wise I wanted to keep things simple... Can you show us? Sure... As you can see here we're talking about a drastic design re-think And the video will have this music track... Beautiful skyscrapers, Each and every one mine Allow yourself to dream Don't break the magic spell Hear the sweet melody Feel love's rhythm Filling us up And all around We find our happy valley Our sunny, happy valley Where precious days await There's always a happy valley The past is microscopic, the future, telescopic We'll always find love Because this is where we belong Find us in the happy valley The sunny, happy valley Where precious days await Find us in the happy valley It's a timeless world, that'll never change Around the world, we all find our own There's always a happy valley Get out of my way Take me somewhere quiet Close the door! Somewhere quiet? It's too noisy here, just drive, please Hypnosis... ...reversal Mental Health Clinic I see... It looks like "conditional post-hypnotic suggestion" Post-hypnotic suggestion? It's written like this Most people think of hypnotism as part of a magic show But in the West, hypnotherapy is a legitimate form of treatment Is that right? The placebo effect is a real medical phenomenon If a respected doctor prescribes something said to be 100% effective even a candy pill can still produce a cure The power of implicit suggestion is thus much greater than we think Don't worry, nobody's cast a spell on you Speaking as a specialist, this is no big deal Let's get you checked out right away This might sting... You feel okay? I don't see anything particularly abnormal But I've never had a patient in such a deep hypnotic state I'd ask the original practitioner to reverse it The original practitioner? People eager to stop smoking are susceptible to hypnosis but not if they don't want to quit Maybe you wanted to sing and dance all along? Next is the 5th grade musical, "The Kids' Island" Shizuka, here's the mic You still have next year Exactly I'm never doing that again! Idiots...are they really hypnotized? Don't be stupid They're just pretending so they can be on TV They're just paid performers You got that right Attention all customers Fortune Land will close in 30 minutes We know you're there. Let us in, please! Or we'll let ourselves in Another one? How much debt is he in? Which company are you? I'm from Cash Plan Inc. He's from Sun Life and he's from... Ito & Associates Well, it's not like that... You're looking for Martyn-san, too? We can't get hold of him, either. It's a damn nuisance - We're coming in - Hello? There's nothing of value here Another runner... The old jerk was just another scam artist Magic rings: 50 yen It's bad news for you, too. Make sure he pays up Hey! Wait up! Open the window! I won't give you any money. I'm not a fraudster But you were his decoy I prefer you say "performer". It's showbiz, you know And you got your money's worth Can I go now? Just wait a minute... Wait, wait... What is it? Do you know where he's gone? I want to know, too. Can you get out? - Let's go to the police - No way in hell Watanabe Private Detective Agency Martyn Ueda? What's your relationship with the old gent? He ran off, after promising me my moment on stage He just made me eat onions every day I didn't get a penny... Martyn Ueda Once Famous TV Hypnotist How about you? Did the little girl become a musical prodigy? As if... I'd have happily taught her how to dance Fine. I sense you're not hunting him on behalf of loan sharks Some colleagues of mine get tempted by the cash But loan sharks are merciless when they get their guy I charge 8,000/hour, 9am-5pm A full day is 64,000 yen If it takes a week to find him... - A week? - You should count on that The total is 448,000 yen Count me out, thanks But... Well? It'll be the same price everywhere In that case, I'd like to proceed When you find the old geezer, let me know For free? And if I find him first, I'll tell you, for free I must admit, I was surprised But thanks to you, I won the bid Did you ad-lib? A sudden inspiration? Yes, sort of... What do you say... Will you join my team? I set up a new office but one person quit I'd be happy to But there's one thing I've got to take care of Can I get a week's holiday? You've got nerve, I give you that Let's have you start next Monday But... I won't wait longer than that Right Welcome to "Music Voyage"... Let's start with this one Shall we go for dinner? Yes But only if it's a quiet place with no music You're an interesting one Sir, we've been expecting you Nice to see you again - I've had plenty - Go on Sorry, work follows me no matter where I go I need my laptop from my car Get another bottle of whatever you like So expensive! Hey, I told you not to call any more, right? I know it was my idea you took paid holiday but... I hate surprises Happy birthday! The whole world is just for me Keep your eyes on the new me I’m sure the glass slipper will fit With this body I've sculpted I should be a worthy prize I bend back my bow Aim my arrow for his heart He's not getting away It's a bullseye for sure Quit pestering me, okay?

It's not what you think I'm sure it isn't Don't stand there, start cleaning! My skirt's ruined... Look, I didn't do it on purpose Yeah, sure.
