[music playing] Why did you call me? Why'd you come over? Because I needed someone to hold. Someone? Why don't I call a bell man? You're a truly warm man, John. How's David? He's at a computer camp for the summer. Computer camp, huh? Like father like son. Does he like it? He loves computers. Has he been eating well? The new housekeeper sayshe's been eating fine. You're real good at this longdistance mothering, Nora. Why don't I put some moremoney in your account? Listen, I got a pretty full day. I'll try to give you a call,you know, but I have a full day. Nora? I'm drowning, John. [music playing] [car honks] Oh, god. Oh! You're OK, Mrs. Schoonover. 100%, not even a scratch. Um, keep me here. If you're claiming an injury, you need a lawyer, not a doctor. No, you don't understand. There's something wrong. Mrs. Schoonover, you're fine. You just had a bit of a scare. Why don't you lie here for a few minutes, and nobody will disturb you. I couldn't remember where I parked my car. That happens to everybodyevery once in a while. It's nothing to worry about. [WHISPERS] I don't have a car. I beg your pardon? [LOUDER] I don't have a car. Maybe you could keep me here. Nora Schoonover, Room 332. I'm your 10 o'clock. Oh, yes, Nora. Sit down. You know, you have somevery disturbed people here. Isn't there a ward for my kind of unstable? Yes, it's called life. Mrs. Schoonover, ourdoctors have been examining you for three days now. You don't want our counseling. You want sanctuary. I'm going to sign your release for tomorrow. Please don't send me back out there yet. If I had a 15-year-old son, I'd want to get out of here as soon as I could. He's 16 years old. He lives with his father, andI am the last person he needs. Are you sure about that? Sure that he's 16? Yeah, he had a birthday a couple of weeks ago. I sent him a couple of Boy George tapes. Sure that he lives with his father? Yeah, the last time I checked, he was. Sure that he doesn't need you. He's sure. Can you blame him? Kid needs a rock, not a sponge. You've been through a bad time, Nora. Your life has changed drastically. You just got your divorce a year ago. 381 days. And then you gave your sonup to John six months ago. Mm-hm It's this loss of companionship that's led you to this depression. Depression? Look, I thought you'd getmarried, you stick it out, you'd work things out. I mean, isn't that what love is? This is your release form, Nora. I think you'll be able tosurvive the wars out there. Yeah, sure. [music playing] Oh! [knocking] Thank god you're here. Look, I honestly don't like asking for help, but I just can't deal with this. Could you, um-- Uh, I'm-- I'm from theMorrison Collection Agency-- I can't touch anythingdead, not even with a spoon. Now, I was going to leavethem for the eaters to eat, except the eaters are dead, too. It's like the Guyana of fishdom. Uh-huh Uh, are-- are you Nora Schoonover? Schoonover, but let's not get acquainted yet. Um, I would never ask thisof anyone but a stranger. Could you scoop? Do you mind if I turn on the television? I need the comfort of oneexpected event followed on the heels of the next expected event at half hour intervals. Are you aware thatyou've missed the last five payments on your car? Well, you're a little late. It's, uh, been repossessed. Come on, Mrs. Schoonover. No, I went out one day,I think it was last March, and it was gone. Well, we never came for your car, but that's next unless you make a payment. Then I guess it was stolen. Did you report it missing to the police? Why would I do that if Ithought it was repossessed? Are you-- are youcurrently employment, ma'am? I'm a temp. A temporary, a fill in. You know, like a telephone operator has a stroke or a biopsy or someone's father dies, then I fill in and do their dirty work. Well, uh, here's your-- here'syour notice of payment due. Now, we sent you a few of these already, but maybe you didn't get them. No, I got them. I just don't see the sense of paying for something I don't have. Well, we'll notify thepolice that it was stolen, and maybe you'll get it back. All right. Just a couple more. MAN [ON TV]: We'll returnto the Edge of Life after this word from our sponsor. [turns off tv] All right. I sold the car. Who wants a rabbit anyway? You-- you can't sell something you don't own. Yeah? Then why did Lincoln have to free the slaves? They were a very nice couple. They only spoke German. They were on their way to Argentina. I gave them a very good deal. Uh-- what should I do-- what-- - Flush them. What else? Yeah. Somehow-- somehow I would'vefigured you for a matchbox funeral in the garden or-- I'll be right back. [toilet flushes] Well, that was fast. Yeah. Uh, look, I can give you-- I can give you a couple of weeks. But then I'm going to need atleast a third of what you owe. OK? Or else you'll break my thumb? You've seen too many oldmovies, Mrs. Schoonover. Bye. [door shuts] Mr. Collection. Brodsky. Brodsky. Thanks-- for the, you know. Here. Take it up to Mrs. Brodsky. Oh, no, no. I don't-- Oh, please, please. You saved my life. Bye. NORA SCHOONOVER: Just one moment, please. Yeah, sorry to put you on hold. No, he is not in right now. Uh, he'll be back around 6 o'clock. Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you, Mr. Senorli. Hey, Nora.You've been here a week now. You better watch it, they're going to put you on the regular payroll. Hello. 4168. Thanks a lot for lunch, Jay. I owe you one. Hey. I am starving. What's the matter? I went to high school with her. Oh. I know how you feel. I went to high school with Frankie Avalon. I always wanted to be Frankie Avalon. [laughs] [music playing] What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Most people say hi first. Hi. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. In the neighborhood. What happened? What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing? Your computer camp is 3,000 miles away. It's all relative. Neighborhood, city, state, the continent-- OK.Everyone gets one question. You first. How did you get here? Bus. You spent three dayson a bus just to be here? Oh, you mean you would have sent me first class airfare if only I had called? Why aren't you in camp? I didn't like it, so I left. Just like that? Just like that. I have to call your father. You can't. He's on another sales trip. He'll come back from his sales trip. I can't believe this. I mean, you just can't runaway from things like that. You got to see things through. Didn't I always teach you that? You always told me that. OK. Probably a bloodhound now. How do you know you didn't like it? What were you there, a week?STEVEN SCHOONOVER: I knew. NORA SCHOONOVER: After one week? STEVEN SCHOONOVER: I hate computers. How can you hate computers? Your father sells the lovable little things. Stop talking like that. Like that? - Just stop it, that's all.- Stop what? It's stupid! What's stupid? You trying to act like a mother. Ah, ah. Look, I'm sorry, boo. Don't call me that. OK. OK. Come on. You got real tall, you know. Yeah. So, uh, who do I call? The camp director? Your father? Can't I just stay here a while? I thought you hated it here. Not that much. Thought you liked New York better. No, it's too hot and noisy now, anyway. Well, um, look, why don'tI make my bed up in there and you could sleep in there until we get hold of your father, and I'll stay out here. And, um, I want to know what happened this past week in camp, OK? OK. Whatever. [music playing] Hi, Nora. - Morning, Jay. - Oh. Patent office is down the end of the hall. And you better hurry. I saw something very similarin the Sears catalog. Not funny, Jay. They all can't be gems. Morning. Oh, it's a beautiful day out. Why don't you go outside? NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: Andnow back to SportsCenter 3, with Virginia and today's guest. INTERVIEWER [ON TV]: Mary Garritee, winner of the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon. Now, Mary, you've held the women's world record in this event, right? Yes, I have. Can you describe the race? Yes. It's a three stage race that's a 2.4 mile swim-- In the ocean, right? Yes. 112 miles on the bike and a 26.2 mile run. And that's over 140 miles. Big deal. INTERVIEWER [ON TV]: And what do you think about during that length of a race? MARY GARRITEE [ON TV]: Well,sometimes I count the miles and sometimes I think,when is this going to end? And then somehow you get past that pain. Yeah, well, some of us like pain. Don't-- MARY GARRITEE [ON TV]: If-- if you can pass that point where you just think you can't take another step-- athletes call it hitting the wall-- and you take that step and you keep on going, then nothing could stop you. INTERVIEWER [ON TV]: Well,you've certainly inspired me. I'm going to run right out andbuy a pair of running shoes. Mary, good luck in this year's Ironman. You are going back, aren't you? Oh, yes. This is my life, as it is for many others. Somehow we're all in this together. Well, we will be right back. But first, we have to makeMax happy with a brief pause. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Mom. Ma? What are you doing out here? NORA SCHOONOVER: You know,I competed against that Mary Garritee in high school? That lady on TV? Yep. 400 meters, April 1969. Did you beat her? Of course I did. Yeah. Well, you used to beat everybody. Yeah. Well, I used to be good. What do you think? Great. You finished something. Maybe you can have acareer as a window washer. You know, you really shouldfill it with some more fish. They're good for company. Yeah. And they're great to cuddle up with, too. Seeing that lady upset you, huh? Not at all. She did look in good shape, though. I wish I could have seen you run. I mean really run. Actually, I did see you runonce to the grocery store. I think it was the 4th of July. Right. We ran out of mustard. Your father was screaming. And, you know, you bike OK-- for a mom. Yeah, but I can't swim. Taught me to swim. Yeah, but that's in a pool. I've always been afraid of the ocean. I'm sure they'd fend off the sharks for you. What Are you getting at? Think you can race again? Oh, sure. Like that. [snaps] After 15-- no, 16 years of sitting around on my buns. Oh, hold on. I remember having these visions of you jogging while I was growingup, in between feeding me frozen pizza and doing laundry. Frozen pizza was theonly thing you would eat. And laundry is one of themore boring chores in life. I used to jog to run off some of my anxiety. So do it again. For 140 miles? I look that anxious? I wasn't talking about that one, but why not? You need to do something. You're the one who needs to do something. The only thing you've done is get taller. I'll make you a deal. What deal? I'll help you train so youcan race against Mary Garritee again this summer. - Oh, come on. Wait, wait, wait. And then next summer, youcan help me train in whatever interest I finally take up. Computers are definitely not it. You've got to be kidding, right? I'm not kidding. Come on, mom. Don't you want to set a better example for me? What are your interests? Well, I used to have a lot ofinterests when I was your age. You don't do anything. Well, I used to do things. When I was your age, I did a lot of things. Anyway, this doesn't seemlike a fair deal to me. Children learn by imitation. OK. You work it out with your father, and maybe you got yourself a deal. OK. I'll call him. But first thing, no more of these. This is nuts. Yeah, we'll see. So come on. Let's study the competition. INTERVIEWER [ON TV]: Can you describe the race? MARY GARRITEE [ON TV]: It's notreally a race against others. It's a race against yourself. It's been called one of the human body's greatest challenges. INTERVIEWER [ON TV]: Mary, thankyou so much for joining us. And we want you to tunein tomorrow for Sports 3. [alarm ringing] [screams] [music playing] [coughing] OK. That's three. Mom, did you really haveto wear that bathing cap? It was the only one I had. You mean this was once a style? Yes, it was. Do you remember how youused to make these things? Mom, can you please take this seriously? Here you go. What's this? A book to help you train. $10.95? Where did you get the money? I-- I borrowed the book. And when we've read it, I'll take it back. Look, I got more in here. You stole them. But I did it for you. Steven, I can't deal with this. You're going to have to goback and live with your father. I'll go to prison and due time, OK? I raised a juvenile delinquent. You haven't raised anything. Now look what you've done. We can go someplace else. No, we can't. Look at that clock. Five minutes to 10:00. Tomorrow they're closed 10 minutes to 10:00. We won't even be able to come here for lunch. [deep breath] OK. Hello? You're closed. OK. Maybe you can faint from hunger. Yeah, let's go. Go ahead. Faint. I'll catch you. I'm not that hungry. Let's go. OK? Chicken. You could steal, but you can't faint? Oh, come on, mom. Don't do this to me. Get up. Come on, get up. Are they coming? Mama? Mom? Ma? [WHISPERS] Stop kicking me. [door opens] Mm, thank you. You're very kind. I'll never skip lunch again. I'm so embarrassed. I hate it when you do stuff. Come on. You're eating, aren't you? OK. I'm sorry. Take those books back, and Ipromise I won't do it again. It was kind of funny. I guess I was thinkingabout what dad would think. So what did dad have to say? Well, I-- I didn't call him yet. I mean, could we wait? He wouldn't understand. Understand what? You know, about our deal. Well, it's just as well because I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, Steven, and I don't think you shouldcount on me for that race. I'm not well. How not well? Well, my head's just not strong enough. This last year has been alittle tough on me, you know. And, well, I even had to go to-- go to the doctor. What doctor? What for? Um, well, it's, uh-- I got real nervous. I had this, uh, anxiety thing or something. And, uh, I couldn't breathe. Oh, that's just another excuse. You always do this. I've never seen you finish anything. You can't breathe becauseyou're smoking all the time. It's not the smoking, Steven. Um-- look, just try to understand, OK? I can't-- I can't take care of you right now. I mean, what if I have togo back in the hospital? Hospital? What are you talking about? You're not sick! You're not! You're a lousy liar! You're not sick! [music playing] [knocking] Steven, open the door. Steven, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I do want you here. I swear it. And-- and I'm not sick. I'm fine, really. It's you I'm worried about. I mean, what kind of kid doesn't like computers? Steven, that race is all the way over in Hawaii. That takes a lot of money and a lot of work. I can't swim. I'm addicted to nicotine. Steven? Steven, please open the door. They're really going to take me away. I'm standing here talking to a door. They were pitching herout, so I thought we could take her in for inspiration. Really? What the heck. Let's give it a shot, huh? She stands. You could beat this turkey! NORA SCHOONOVER: Just keep going. Just keep going. I'm going to die. My lungs are screaming. My legs are killing me. Don't pay attention to that. No problem. An old lady passes me. Great. Great. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Harder! Stretch farther ahead of you. Pretend you have to pull all that water past you. Come on. Only 16 more in this set. Swimming is an unnatural act. You told me life began in the water. It doesn't mean you have to go back Garritee was out of the water in 1:11. [music playing] I need a cigarette. You can't even breathe as it is. [music playing] What's the matter? NORA SCHOONOVER: Look at these people. They're perfect. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Come on, mom. Hey, mom. Here's the bike you need, mom. She's going to be in the Hawaiian Triathlon. Oh, really? Well, your son's right. This is the bike you'll be needing. Excuse us. Mom-- You see this inch? That's how far they're going every day. See this arm? That's how far I have to go. See this face? It's going home to bed. Last week you could only swim 500 meters. And this week you've been doing 1,000. That is true. But I am so sore, Steven. This isn't even my body. I feel like a used-up punching bag. Yesterday you came withinseven seconds of your 400-meter college record. I know that is true, too,but I am out of my league here. Look, I'm tired of talking you into this. We made a deal. Steven. Steven. Get-- Sir? Yes? How much is that bike? [music playing] STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Hi. Good time! Give me your hand. A dog attacked me. Huh? [music playing] STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Come on. Follow through. You're splashing too much. You can take your head outof the water, you know. Come on. Pace yourself. Kick! Hey. Don't tell me. You're going to take it out of my paycheck? Well, fine. Uh, payroll's down the hall. Oh, no-- What are those for? For you. Hello. I'm her son. - Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't realize-- It's OK. She's divorced. Mr. Collection, this is my son, Steven. Steven, uh, this is the manwho wants me to pay for the car that I no longer have, the white Rabbit. No, no. I'm Will Brodsky, and I didn'tcome here about the car. Oh? For lunch? Want some? - No, no. You made me laugh. I went home and I thought aboutthe dead fish, and I laughed-- I laughed all night. I just figured that anywoman who can accomplish that deserves further investigation. Oh, Esther Williams. You want to get in here? Your board's all lit up. Well, um, gotta go. Oh. Uh, here. I reported your car stolen. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you again. If I had known you were starving, I would've sent out theRed Cross a long time ago. I'm not starving. Carbo loading. You're what? Carbohydrates provide more energy than protein because 10% less oxygen is needed to metabolize them. Thank you, Mr. Wizard. I'm in training for a race. Oh, yeah? What kind of race? A long one. First, um, I have toswim 2.4 miles, bike 112, and then run a marathon, 26.2 miles. Oh, my god. How long does that take? Mary Garritee finished in 11 hours 20 minutes and 45 seconds. And where is she buried? [laughter] So what do you win? What do you-- what do youget if you win this race? Nothing. But if you rise on the third day, they start a religious order in your name. Mom, can I go play? Mm-hm. Where's the race? - Hawaii. - Oh. That's nice. Do you run these all the time? First one-- maybe. Maybe? What do you mean? Well, I get up each morning and pretend I'm racing the race. Gets me out of bed and gets him out, too. At least he'll have an interesting what-I-did-on-my-summer-vacationcomposition for the fall. Why are you pretending? Because I really can't see me doing that. I mean, I could see to the end of the pool or to the end of the bikepath, but anything past that-- Like to Hawaii? I can't see that. I mean, this race is a big deal. Very together, normal people do it. I-- I don't think I could do that. Does he-- does he know-- does he know you feel like this? It looks to me like he's workingvery hard to get you to Hawaii. Well, you never know what'll happen. But all I know is that-- well, this is the first thing my son and I have ever really done together, and it feels real nice. I don't think it actually matters if we ever make it to the race. I'm having a real good time trying. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Night, Will.Thanks for dinner. Yeah. Good night, Steven. Hey. Listen, I-- I have a weddingto attend this Saturday. Would you go with me? NORA SCHOONOVER: Oh. No, thank you. I'm no good at weddings. WILL BRODSKY: We just sit there and eat. [laughter] NORA SCHOONOVER: No, thank you. Well, how about the baseball game on Sunday? The Angels and the Tigers. No, thank you. What's the matter? Why did you say yes to dinner? Because you're nice. And now? Too nice. [music playing] Mom. Yes, you're in the right place. Take a seat. There's plenty of them now. Mom. And I'm making you dinner,but not frozen pizza. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Dad's here. Don't be mad at me. I-- I finally called him. I didn't think he'd be in town so soon. Hello, Nora. Hi, John. Somehow I never eventhought this place had walls. Well, I guess the copsfinally caught up with you, kid. Did you bring the handcuffs? Look, I didn't kidnap him. And I called the guy at the computer camp. I did everything I could-- He knows that, mom. What's this about a race you've entered? Well it's very complicated. Uh, first, you have to get over to Hawaii and compete in the qualifying race. Then if, uh-- well, if you makeit through that, then they let you stick around and make a foolout of yourself in the big one, right? Well, this takes money. Yeah. Well, I've been taken upcollections in the streets at night. Oh. Well, I'm prepared to help you. And I'm prepared not to take your help. Why are you always trying to control me with your damn checkbook? Mom, we need his help. We don't need his help. Nora. I'm trying to be supportivein anything that helps you get your act together. Well, John, if you really wanted to be supportive, why don't juststick around and help me train, huh? You know I can do that. Here. Now, if you're not doing OK, you let me know. I'll come and pick up Steven. I want to pick him up anywaybefore you go to Hawaii-- if you go. No, I want to go to Hawaii. Uh-uh. Nope. You need that week to get ready for school. But, dad, look at my charts. We're doing a lot of work here. I'm going to Hawaii. No, you're not. Steven, you know how she hastried this with other things. Art classes, ballet lessons. Steven, your father's right. That week before school ismuch more important than this. Mom. The check's right there-- just in case. I'll talk to you soon. Call me later. Puts the check in office. Why do you always give into him? Just because he talkslouder than you doesn't mean he's right. I just can't stand the arguing. Is that why you didn't tell him about our deal? No. He doesn't care. OK. Relax those shoulders. Relax them. Keep your eyes on the horizon. I can't believe I haven'tlost an ounce doing this. OK. How'd I do, huh? Not bad. Hi. Uh-oh. Hey, mom. I want to run-- Don't act like such a nerd. He seems like a nice guy.OK? He is. That's why I'd rather not see him. He brought you a pizza. Hi. Red Cross here. Hi. How you doing? What's this? We're making a training log for phase one. The date, the activity, her time, her distance, and comments. And that's if she thoughtit was a hard work or if it was raining or ifshe broke her old record. Yeah. And this column here, what's this for? Oh, you get a gold star if youremember to brush your teeth. Pulse rate. The resting pulse rateshould be used as a control guide for the training program. If it is more rapid than usual, your body is signaling you to slow down. Yeah. Yeah. That's real sharp. Excuse me. Listen, I hope I'm not intruding here, but you don't have a phone and--- Yeah, I know. Yeah. So I had to come by in person to ask you. Ask me what? Well, if you'd have dinner with me again. No, it worked the first time. We're good with food, don't you think? Oh. I think you're talkingabout dating, aren't you? Oh, no. No, no, I didn't say that. No, that's a nasty word to some people. Yeah. What do you say? Just a little dinner. Well, I have to ask my coach. I don't know if it'sallowed. [WHISPERS] Say no. Uh, I don't know. It's not in the book. WILL BRODSKY: I like women. Well, good. Oh, yeah. I don't keep pets. I quit smoking. - Me too. - Yeah. You miss it? Yes, a lot. And I've never been in afight that I didn't start. And that's it. You don't really play Tiddlywinks, do you? No, no, I'll teach you. Actually, there's-- [laughter]there's a Tiddlywinks triathlon coming up in the spring. You tiddle for six hours. - No, you don't. - Oh, yes, you do. You tiddle, and then you wink, and then you tiddle, and then you-- Will. What? I have to tell you something. What's that? I'm sort of seeing someone. You in love with him? Just used to him. Then break it off. Hard to give up that easily. I don't give up that easily, Nora. [music playing] [bus honking] NORA SCHOONOVER: OK. I'm moving. I'm moving. Well, hi there. Wanna race? OK. So you won that one. How you doing, Mrs. Meyer, huh? Hey, mom. NORA SCHOONOVER: Yeah? Got a little present for you. Oh. Uh-- OK. What? What's this? Well, you got a little bean curd, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, desiccated liver, acidophilus, all blendedin a base of cabbage juice. Enjoy. - Right. What book did this come from? No book. I saw it on of those TV cook shows. Come on. Drink up. Go on. [laughing] Thank you very much, dear. No more TV. OK? This is the mostentertaining time of my life. Look at you. Good. Maybe I ought to charge admission. Maybe. Oh, Will, what do you want with me? I'm a bad bet. Hey. Come on. There's no money on the line. I think I love you. - No, you don't. Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - OK. I don't. Good. I think I do again. Hey. Look, let's let's get backto talking about the race. OK. Now-- now, it is very scary toyou, but evidently not as scary as me. I know that eventually I'm going to break into that wonderful heart of yours. Not a chance. Not a chance. My heart is very safe in a drawer at the Beverly Hills junior science fair. You know, I like to help out where I can. Stop. Stop. Will you stop? Now, you are going to dump thisguy you may still be seeing, whoever he is, and you'regoing to start feeling confident about this race. Come on. You leave next month. Yeah. And I still can't make it to the break water. Nora, you're almost there. You've done much longer stretches in the pool. Yeah. Even though-- all that money to go over there, and I may not even qualify. OK. OK. So don't go. Huh? No, don't go. Go back to your temp jobs. Go back to the hospital. Go anywhere that it's safe. I have watched you break your butt, and I'll be damned if I'm goingto let you use the first excuse to pull out of this. Because we both know that this is not just a race or some crazyway to impress your kid. No! This is reentry. This is you rejoining the human race. Don't you think I know that? Oh, Will. Just hold me. It's OK, Nora. [music playing] Mr. Schuller's residence. No, I'm sorry. He's not in right now. May I take a message? [SINGING] Time to rise. No time to mend. Gotta face the world again. I wish I knew what I was doing here. It's a dream. No, it's real. I can't tell you how I feel. I'm going down, down, down one more time. Trying to get myselftogether one step at a time. Don't worry if I slip or fall. I get up every time. I turn my life around. Turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. I turn my life around. I turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. Gotta a while. I'm on the road. This time look who's in control. I'm breaking loose and taking my turn now. No more tears, no regrets. No more holding back for me. From now on, I'm giving it all I got! Well, it's a personal evolutionthat I'm going through. This time I'm going all the way. Just take a look and see me turn my life around. Turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. Turn my life around. Turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. I'm getting myself together. I've discovered me. There's a new kid in the neighborhood. Look fast, and you'll seeme turn my life around! Turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. Turn my life-- turn my life-- turn my life around. We've gotta get Steven to theother end of the terminal. WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER]: Allpassengers, we'll be boarding passengers for Flight 483. Now boarding at Gate 27. Well. Have a good trip with your dad, OK? Try to do well in school this year. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Have fun. OK. WILL BRODSKY: Here. Well, I'm off. WILL BRODSKY: OK. Bye-bye. Don't forget your breathingexercises and your stretches, and remember to use that two-feet crossover kick. It's better for you than the other ones we tried. Bye. OK.Let's get you over there. You got everything? Oh, I think this is yours. Well, it is, but you take it with you. What are we going to tell your dad when we tell him you're in Hawaii? What? You're my coach. I can't go without you. - Yeah. But he only gave us enoughmoney for your ticket. Not necessarily. Two stand-bys should equal one full payer. I guess so. Hey, Will. Will you call my dad, tellhim I won't be on the flight? What? You want me to call him? - No. Wait, wait-- [MUSIC - BILLY VAUGHN, "LITTLE BROWN GAL"] [SINGING] It's not the islandfare calling me, the balmy air, the tropical sea. But it's a little brown gal in a little grass skirt in a little grass shack in Hawaii. It isn't Waikiki or Kamehameha's pali, not the beach boys free with their hoomalimali. But it's a little brown girl in a little grass skirt in a little grass shack in Hawaii. Through that island wonderland, she's broken all the kanes' hearts. It's not hard to understand. For that wahine is a gal of parts. I'll be leavin' soon. But the thrills I'veenjoyed is not the island moon, nor the fish and the poi. But it's a little brown gal in a little grass skirt in a little grass shack in Hawaii. [indistinct chatter] Hey. Hi, Mike. How are you? Here we are. Back for another year. Hi. Nora Schoonover. [MUSIC - BILLY VAUGHN, "LITTLE BROWN GAL"] [SINGING] It's not hard to understand. That wahine is a gal of parts. I'll be leaving soon. But the thrills I'veenjoyed is not the island moon, nor the fish and the poi. But it's a little brown gal in a little grass skirt in a little grass shack in Hawaii. Steven. Well, don't kill it. Could you turn that air conditioner on? It's boiling in here. It is on. Oh, you've got to be kidding. Don't you believe me? I believe you. I don't believe this. What are you doing? Well, you can't-- it's so hot. I can't breathe in here. Mom, it's fine in here. You're in Hawaii. Look, it's beautiful. Where else can you get an oceanview at a price like this? I wonder if they have lizardsover at that fancy hotel. What's the matter with you? Eh, I got so out of it at registration. All those people knew each other. They were like old army buddies. Did you try saying hello? Look, this girl I met invitedus to the carbo loading party tonight. You want to go? Come on. You could pig out on spaghetti and pizza and popcorn and potatoes. What do you say? It's a whole big deal, a triathlon tradition. I don't fit in with those people. You're just nervous. Now, do you want to go to this party or not? I'm going to the party. [music playing] Hi, guys. Nora, I want you to meet my friends. This is Leslie, Mark, and Mike. Mike won last year and Mark the year before. They trade off and share the spotlight. You guys, this is Nora's first year. Aloha. Aloha. You know, you should really stock up on some of these complex carbos. They give you a lot of energy. Yeah? Good. Have some spaghetti. You know, I really recommend concentrating on the broad stroke. It really is the best in the long run. No pun intended. Thanks. Well, what are you, a coach? Well, yeah. I watch very closely andcritique in a very loud voice. Oh. Uh, so where are you from? New York. No, no. LA. No. New York. I'm bi-coastal. [indistinct chatter] No, mom! Mom, here! I got a seat for you. These people eat like animals. Is that all you took? No, I ate some. Where are you going? I'll see you later. I'm getting some beers. Oh. Well, don't you drink any of it. Drinking age here is 12. It's OK. Over here, Mary. Hey, Mary, come on. One more pic. Come back over this way please. Mary? Hey, Mary. Come on! I always think one picture is enough. They can make reprints. Hi. Nora Schoonover. Mary. I know, Garritee. I was Hauffer back then. Back when? Savage High, the Bronx. Wow. You're from Savage High. I ran against you. You probably don't remember. You compete in so many races. I beat you. I never forget who beat me. You were on the relay team. Yeah. Oh, we were scared to death of you. Oh, come on. No, you guys were really fast. Yeah, we were fast. Oh, I wish I was fast now,especially in the ocean. You know, I take itreally easy during the swim. You don't want to leave your whole race out there in the ocean. Besides, you're a strong runner. You're going to make up a lot of time there. It's like a Roman orgy here, you know. Keep on eating. You're going to need it later. I am. You ever have anightmare that you're not going to burn any of this off and you'll wake up resembling the Goodyear blimp? [laughs] It's not a beauty contest. Oh, I know that. It's an endurance race. You know, you're going tolose five or six pounds. You're really going to need all of that food. You just keep on eating. You know, this is so muchmore fun than Boy Scouts. What are you talking about? Remember, we missed that meeting for signing up in Boy Scouts? Oh, yeah. I ran out of gas. You got all mad and said that Boy Scouts wasn't for me, anyway. Yeah. Well, if it was anything like the Brownies, where they taught you how totie knots eight different ways-- You started crying. I'm sorry I did that to you. It's OK. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. No, it's not. You're a real good kid. You're smart. You're even funny. Despite me, not because of me. What, you think I gotall those wonderful traits from dad? Got a point there. Well, the bike's ready for the qualifying race. I just hope I am. [music playing] [SINGING] Feeling good about me. Feeling fast and free. Feeling good about who I amand how it's going to be. I'm feeling good about me. Feeling fast and free. Feeling good about who Iam, how it's going to be. You've got to set your mind and your body free. Baby, doo-run-run, doo-run-run. Working day and night to treat your body right. Baby, doo-run-run, doo-run-run. When you're down on yourselfand there's nobody else, you've got to come alive-- [applause, cheering] [SINGING] I'm feeling good about me. Feeling fast and free. Feeling good about who I amand how it's going to be. [screaming] You were pretty shaken up. I want you to spend at leastthe afternoon here, yeah? And I might suggest not too much movement. I wasn't exactly goingto go home and do the hula. [groan] Easy. Thanks a lot, doc. Sure. Don't worry, honey. I'm all in one piece. Nothing's broken. There's just an ugly bruise on my arm. I'm sorry, mom. What are you sorry about? You should've seen me, kid. I was flying, I really was. I was passing them right and left. I was even making up some timethat I lost in the swimming. Oh, gosh. I was flying. And all the time, I kept thinking to myself, I'm doing it, I'm really doing it. I saw you. You were really doing it. Yeah. Well-- honey, could you come around this side? Oh, boy. Such a stupid mistake. Not shifting gears in time. It was a rock, mom. You hit a rock. No. No, it happened before that. You see, you get into a rhythm when you race. And you make one littlemistake, and I broke my rhythm. It not the rock's fault. I wasjust beginning to like it here. Nora. Hey, Mary. I heard about your arm. Eh. Does it hurt? Only when I cry. [laughs] But you're not going to go home, are you? I've been a spectator half my life. I know what that's like. I don't want to spend theweek doing that, you know. So what's the doctor say? Oh. Don't move. So what's he going todo, carry you on the plane? My son Steven's liftingweights now in preparation. You know, your name automatically goes into the lottery. What if they pick you? There's a lottery? I mean, I maybe get a chance to win something? Didn't you read your packet? Yeah, it says, you don't qualify, go home. No, it didn't say that. It said, if you didn't make the necessary time in the qualifying race, you automatically go into a lottery. They pick 10 names. It's their way of givingeveryone a second chance. Yeah. Well, I've always been real lucky. I won a church raffle once. I definitely see SavageHigh represented in this race. Savage High was condemned. They shut it down. Listen, Nora. The lottery's on Thursday. Why don't you just stick around? I'll-- I'll see if the weather holds. You better keep training. Good luck! Thank you! [music playing] Yes. Collect from Nora. And there's a nuclear warhead. WILL BRODSKY [ON PHONE]: Hello? Hello, Will. Nora. Hi. Did you make it? Why haven't you called? I've been so worried. How are you? Well, this rock came and hit me on the bike. Uh, I'm a little bruised up. Are you OK? Well, the bike's OK. WILL BRODSKY [ON PHONE]: Forget the bike. What about you? I didn't finish, so I didn't qualify. I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted this. It's not over. There's this lottery Thursday,so I still might make it. I don't know. Hey. You went over there and you tried. Now, don't kill yourself. It wouldn't be such a disasterif you didn't make the lottery. Yes, it would. WILL BRODSKY [ON PHONE]: Why? Patient's history is pretty lousy. It's not that lousy. Well, I better let you go, Will. OK. I miss you. Yeah I'll see you. WILL BRODSKY [ON PHONE]: Bye, honey. You take care. Good luck. OK. I miss you, too. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Are you asleep? No. You? That lizard you found onthe chair is called a gecko. I asked the man at the desk. Sorry you came? Sorry you brought me? No. What do you say we gosightseeing tomorrow, huh, boo? Don't call me that. You know that was your first name. I mean, we hadn't settledon the name Steven yet, so I used to call you baby boo. Yeah. Well, it's a dumb name. Well, I was pretty dumb. You were a real cute baby, though. So tiny. You were about as big as my arm. Your head could fit in my hand. I was always so frightened thatI would hurt you when I picked you up because you have-- well, you have to be real careful witha baby's neck because it's-- well, it's not very strong. And I'd take you and I'd holdyou real close to my heart. I'd say, don't move, boo. [music playing] There was this nurse. She always said it was OK to beafraid, that I'd get over it. But I never did. My neck's OK. You didn't wreck it or anything-- in case you were wondering. Yeah, I was. Thanks. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: What if we don't get picked? Well, I figured if we don'tget picked, then we'll be OK. But if we do get picked, it'll just show how crazy we've been all along. First of all, I'd like tosay that it is an honor for me to be the race director of the Ironman and to be associated with so many fine and dedicated athletes. [applause, cheering] As you know, the course can only safely accommodate 1,200 participants. 10 of you picked today will join those 1,200 at the starting line this Saturday. Good luck to all of you! Dana Powell. [cheering] Peggy Winters. [cheering] Susan Ludington. [cheering] Maggie de Baxter. [cheering] So, how's your girlfriend? Mom, she's not my girlfriend. William Penway. [cheering] Look, why don't we just call it a vacation, leave in the morning, and never bring it up under penalty of death. What, you can't even finish a lottery? - Nora Schoonover. - Who? Who? [cheering] Look who it is! [music playing] Hi. Hi. This is the first time wespent the whole night together. Yeah. I'll write it in my calendar. Yeah. Well, it was wonderful. Ow. Oh, hey, hey. Come on. We're going to get that arm X-rayed. Most people just smoke after. Can I help you get dressed? There's nothing the matter with my arm. Those weren't screams of ecstasy. How do you know? I'm good. I'm not that good. Now, see this line? Unfortunately. Well, that's a hairline fracture on your ulna, the long bone between the elbow and the wrist. What does this mean? She was just in here a few days ago. Did the X-ray show it then? Look, sometimes a hairline fracture doesn't show up for days untilthe calcium rearranges itself. You don't know until you feel the pain. What does this mean? A cast. Oh, she-- she can't swimwith a cast and she won't be able to control the bike. Nora. Nora, look, I'm very sorry,but when your arm is healed, you can train for next year. OK? - Yeah. Well, how do I know there'sgoing to be a next year? I can walk. I can run. I've been biking. It's easy to swim with one arm. Lifeguards do it all the time. What do you say, doc? You triathletes are[inaudible],, crazy people. You can do anything you think you can do. So if, um, run the race,my arm won't fall off or anything, right? It would be better if I cast it now. You're going to be in a lot of pain. Yeah. Well, I'm used to pain. Wrap it up. Mom. Do you really want to do it? I don't believe you. After you invested all thistime in me for one big day, you want one little line to ruin it? Not me. Wrap it up. Are you sure about this? Well, sure as I'm going to be. Can you wrap it tight enoughso it will feel like a new arm? Well, it's going to feellike you have a splint on. And your pals are going tohave to redo it after you come out of the water. OK. Watch closely, pals. STEVEN SCHOONOVER: Hey, ma. Nora. Come on. Where you been? We've been looking all over for you. Dad called. He's ticked off that I'm still here. I guess he didn't thinkwe'd make the big race, huh? Yeah. Well, there's nothing he could do about it now. Bringing you to Hawaii was the best thing I could have done for you. See ya. Bye. For me? She brought me over here for her. What a funny mother. Oh, this is so beautiful. Mm-hm. It's just perfect. I'm so glad you begged me to come here. Oh, really? Oh, here. I have something I want to give you here. For you. Aw. Open it. Open it. Now, I want you to wearthis during the race, OK? Don't worry about losing or anything. It didn't belong to my grandmother. I can buy another one. It's real cheap. Well, thanks a lot. I love you. Let's talk about that now. I've got a race to run tomorrow. You don't believe it, do you? You just haven't seen the mistakes I make yet. I'm a natural at them. Somebody's got to show you that mistakes can be loved, too. You don't know. You just don't know. I'll love finding out. Yeah? Yeah. OK. Don't say I didn't warn you. I have been warned. Yeah. Why don't we back to the hotel? I'll tuck you in. OK? Tell you a story. You go back. Um, I'm just going to spend a minute here. OK? - OK. - My shoes. - Oh, yeah. Come back. [music playing] [cheering] JIM: It's almost 7:00 AM now, the sun just glancing over the Pacific. 1,200 athletes in theirfinal moments of preparation and anticipation, as they awaitthe start of the most grueling single day event in sports, a 2.4 mile swim, a 112 mile bike ride, a marathon run 26.2 miles. Now let's visit our reporterat the start of the swim. This is Brad Harris. The race begins here in the dawning hours. 1,000 athletes will swim 1.2miles out into the ocean, and then back to this pier wherethey will shower and change and find theirrespective bikes and race 112 miles across thebeautiful Hawaiian coast. Not all will finish, but those who will will earn the honored butelusive title of Ironman. It is a race for only themost ambitious and dedicated of athletes. JIM: Athletes like Mark Wilson,last year's second place finisher back to try to win,and Mary Garritee, returning to defend her Ironwoman title, both of them inspirations to all the otherathletes who have gathered on this Saturday morning. Among them, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and architects, a black jackdealer, and a newlywed couple. WOMAN: The tension is building as they find their respective places on the beach. There is no official starting order. Each athlete knows his or her own ability. And the stronger swimmersnaturally move to the front. Each athlete uses these few remaining seconds for a final necessarymoment of concentration. [bang] [cheering] This is the moment when monthsand months of rigorous training comes to a head. Scanning the scene, we see some1,200 athletes, all of whom can only be feeling atremendous sense of relief. The day is finally here. Many of these triathletesare strongest in this first of three events, the swim. Others can pick up time on the bike course, while the rest gain groundduring the marathon run. It all adds up to 10 to 17 hoursof very, very strenuous work. JIM: And then even theleaders during this segment must isolate their thoughts in the water. If they begin to contemplatethe hours of exertion they'll experience on the bike or in the marathon, they may lose the rhythmnecessary to pull the body stroke by stroke out tothe twin sailboat anchored on the horizon 1.2 milesaway, then back to the shore and the bike stand. The least helpful consideration now is the one which is so painfully obvious, that it will be a long dayand it is just beginning. Now with a little less than one hour elapsed, the lead swimmers are arriving at the beach. Mark Wilson, first out of the water a year ago, is again the leader. But Mike Nadan, who overtookWilson to win last year, is right behind him. WOMAN: And, Jim, as they comeout of the water, the swimmers are disoriented and will struggle to get their land legs back. They've been in the water for an hour. They feel shaky. But first, they will haveto shower off the salt water to avoid chafing, change into biking gear, and then hurry to find their bikes. [music playing] JIM: Now the first woman out of the water is defending champ Mary Garritee, and this must give her great confidence. The bike and the run are normally the stronger events for her. WOMAN: And, Jim, bothstrong muscles and endurance conditioning are essential here. While the arms and shoulders are exhausted, they look forward to restingthe upper portion of the body as the legs take over in thenext two sections of the race. Leslie Anders, second womanlast year, is second again. JIM: Now here's a fascinating story. Back in the pack, number 973is Nora Schoonover competing in her very first triathlon. MAN: 673. 122. 33. 202. 122. 35. 432. 127. 43. JIM: Nora Schoonover leavesthe water in 58th place. The bandage you see on her arm protects a hairline fracture sufferedin the qualifying race. She got into the field via the lottery. MAN: 140. 34. 416. Where is everybody? Like who? Give me numbers. Number one. Just about an hour ahead. - That's not bad. - Not bad at all. Make it tight. I didn't do bad in the swimming. No, you were great. OK. Good. Boy, am I glad you guys are here. Banana. One banana. Thanks. Give it your all. Good luck. Go get them. JIM: The bicycle segment is the long middle third of this event, more than five hours of riding, most of it into a 17 mile per hour headwind the Hawaiians call moomuku. Right now the temperatureis soaring past 90 degrees, on its way to the 100 mark. [music playing] WOMAN: They've been on the road for 2 and 1/2 hours already, Jim. The leaders are approachingthe turnaround point at Hawi, 56 miles up the Kona coast. Now, fatigue is already setting in. It's the body's inner resistanceto constant powerful exertion that is beginning to playhavoc on the less tolerant. JIM: After losing the leadon his bicycle last year, Mark Wilson has focused histraining on this segment. Now you see him maintainingthe lead he brought with him out of the ocean this morning. 56 more miles of bicycleriding ahead of him, 1,199 other triathletes behind him. And as noon approaches,the heat is intensifying. [music playing] The first woman at the Hawi turnaround point is Mary Garritee, the woman whohas been pursued by many others over the past few years,seeking her number one ranking. This year, Lee Kalani Oleyoli iswithin sight of her rear wheel. And earlier, we asked KalaniOleyoli to assess her chances. I feel like a kid on my first day of school. I have butterflies. But I think this is my year to win. [music playing] [cheering] JIM: Now here's another lookat Nora Schoonover, number 973, as she makes the turn at Hawi. We'll be following her progress, as she seems to be making some progressup through the back during this bicycle segment. Fascinating story. She was a high school classmate-- WOMAN: Uh-oh. Look at this. Trouble here, Jim. Kalani Oleyoli is down. I don't know if her-- kind of looked like her shifting cable snapped. I tell you, unless she can fix it on the spot, there's absolutely no way she can maintain that number two position. [music playing] JIM: Now Mark Wilson, still the leader, makes the transition from pedaling a bike to running a marathon. Earlier, we asked Mark about the problem of making yourself believe that you're going to finish the triathlon. You know, most of us trainabout five or six hours a day. A lot of people think of usas some kind of super people. But really, it's not an impossibility to finish the Hawaiian Triathlon. It's all really just a state of mind. JIM: Well, it looks like the broken arm is doing little to hinder NoraSchoonover's bike performance. She's made up time lost in the swim and has moved up to 42nd among the women. MARY GARRITEE: How am I doing? You're the first woman, andyou've got an 8 minute lead. JIM: Despite their almostindescribable difficulty, these events are growing rapidly. And before the race, one of our reporters spoke to defending women'stitlist Mary Garritee about the future of triathlons. The triathlon isincreasing in its popularity. Do you ever see itbecoming an Olympic event? MARY GARRITEE [ON TV]: Of course. We had the biathlon, the pentathlon, the heptathlon, the decathlon. Why not the triathlon? The Olympics aren't for the young only. This is a sport that requiresthe maturity and the discipline necessary to gain that endurance. JIM: It goes without sayingthat most of the athletes we see in this event are here for something other than the glory of winning. Many of them are special peoplewho might not be competing had not some obstacle or shortcomingspurred them to want to expand their own personal boundaries. An example is Nora Schoonover. Even with a broken arm, she'sgained 31 places on the bike, moving up to 27th among the women. [cheering] Ow. Did you see me? - Yes, I did. Now just worry about yourself.- OK. Make it tighter this time. All right. Did you see the bike? It got pretty beat up. I can fix it. I don't know. Looks like it's going to take some time. It needs a whole overhaul. I've got all winter. And all summer, too. And probably all next winter as well. I'm so proud of you, mom. I want to come home to live with you. - Honey, you better get going.- Ow. OK. Thanks. I feel phenomenal. - All right. Go. Go get them. Hey, only 26 more miles. [music playing] WOMAN: The bike to runtransition is by far the most difficult. For over five hours,they've been forcing their legs in a circular motion. Cycling is a sport of extremes and totally exhausting at full power. Yet, now they must shift, and, well, many of these triathletesthighs may tie up as they head into the final phase. The bottom line is they absolutely cannot afford to waste energyon an awkward running style. It's now 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and the heat is becoming almost unbearable. On the road, it's over 100 degrees. As the front runners reach the halfway point, the majority of the athletes have just changed into their running shorts and they're beginning the marathon. For even the most experienced of runners, there is always the question ofwhether they can beat the heat and finish the final 26.2 miles. JIM: Now they are on theirown, separated by time, distance, and determination. It is more difficult now because they are alone. It is less a race ofcompetitor against competitor than a race within the individual spirit against one's own limitations. [music playing] Another look at Nora Schoonover. She was a runner in high school before motherhood took her off the track. So she'll be hoping some of that natural ability will resurface now. [cheering] Now the first finisher arrives. It's Mark Wilson. The time, 9 hours 8 minutes 23 seconds, a new record for the Ironman event. Come on. Only four more miles. JIM: And now as we look back at Nora Schoonover, she is beginning toexperience some difficulty. For the first time sincegetting into the marathon phase of the event, she's losing ground to the runners behind her. We're about to see the first woman finisher in this year's triathlon. It's Mary Garritee, a successfuldefense of the Ironwoman title she won a year ago. Now as we look back in the pack again, it appears number 973, NoraSchoonover, is in great pain. Perhaps hitting the wall, the term athlete use to denote the point at which they have reached their physical limit. It appears that Nora Schoonover is now going to learn just howbadly she wants to overcome her own personal limitations. [groaning] Here. Put this on your feet. It'll help. WOMAN: It's 7:00 PM. 12 hours have passedsince the cannon went off. The sun is beginning to set. Some athletes have dropped out of the race, unable to meet the physicalchallenge of the Ironman, while those remaining on the course have pushed themselvesbeyond imaginable limits. Yet, they continue toward the finish line. Come on. A mile left. Let's go. JIM: Now hundreds of men andwomen have completed the test. And again, we go back to pickup the story of Nora Schoonover. The man you see there next to her is Donald Turnquist, number 478. A personal story in himself, having overcome a debilitating lung disease to be here. For the moment, it appears that Turnquist has paused to encouragethe faltering Schoonover. 8:00 PM. Now 13 hours into the race. The sun is gone. For many of the athletes,this race is over. But for more, the agony continues. [gasps] Nora Schoonover has fallen down. Come on. Get up. JIM: She's put more than140 miles behind her today. But with 100 yards to go to the finish, it is by no means certainthat she'll make it. Come on. 30 yards to go. Get up. [cheering] JIM: The bodily strength is thoroughly gone now. Exhausted muscles no longerreceive signals from the brain. Let's go. You got it. Come on. You got it. Let's go. You got it. JIM: She's getting up. Get up. You got it. You got it. JIM: And now as this womanwho has never before completed the triathlon tries to coverthe last 75 to 100 yards, the crowd here at the finishwill try to urge her on. Keep it up. You're doing well. Keep it up. [cheering] Keep it up. We're almost there. Almost there. Somebody help her. Nora! Excuse me, please. Nora, you all right? Mom? Mom, you don't have to go on. Come on, honey. You got 20 feet to go, baby. Come on, Will. Do something. Please stop her. This is crazy. I don't care anymore. Do it. Come on, mom. Get up. 10 yards. 10 yards. That's it. You got it. Come on. Let's go. 10 yards, and you're over. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go, Nora. Go. You're amost there. Keep going. You can do it. ALL: 5, 4, 3, 2-- [cheering] JIM: With a time of 13 hours32 minutes and 29 seconds, 35-year-old Nora Schoonoverfinishes in 217th place. [music playing]
