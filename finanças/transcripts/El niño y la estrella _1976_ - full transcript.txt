Come along. Let's see if you caught anything. Ouch! I'll get revenge, Pops! Come on, prepare the trigger. You're going to pay me, eh? Oh, you'll see! There. It's the snake you killed this morning. Really? Not again, no, Grandfather! ~ Now you say "No, Pops"? ~ Quiet down! You heard me. I'll leave you hanging all night to learn your lesson. No, Grandfather, no! How dare you say "No"? I won't do it again. Stop it, Grandfather. ~ All night. ~ I'm falling! Mischievous brat! Come on, son, let's collect the birds! Let's go. Don't you want another salty fat-fried dough? Just coffee, while I smoke a cigarette. Here. Let it cool down. Listen, Pops: Can it be that he had a grandfather, too? Well, sure. Just like you and everyone else. And my mom and dad. Everyone, right. But of course I don't have a mom or dad. But you did, before the fevers killed them. And they were both good people, weren't they? You can be sure of that. So they're are in heaven, there, in some star? Maybe God made the stars so high and bright for a reason. Surely for us to remember our loved ones. Look, look at those two stars, so close together and so cool. Maybe they are your mom and dad. And that one, the biggest and brightest, may well be the Virgin! Hey...which is God? That one? No, the Father is above all stars, since He created them. Don't forget He's the Supreme Being, the Word. Burro! Burro! Burro! How voluptuous you are, dear! How voluptuous you are, dear! How voluptuous you are, dear! Listen, Pops, why do you have to teach them profanities? They aren't rude, son, people like roguish parrots, and women like compliments. Yeah, but these ones are useless idiots. I'd better challenge you on a spinning top match. Are you playing? I'll play a short match before I go set the traps, but the spin will be a bread tip. Play! Move. Look out, mare! You shut up! Cool, Merino! Wow, long time no see, man! Well, you've been away. It was only three months. ~ When will you take me for another ride? ~ Whenever you want. Daily, if that's what you want. Just tell your grandfather to walk you to the village. Mule! Mare! ~ What good mules you're bringing now! ~ And horses. And donkeys, too. See you later. I'm having dinner at the inn. Hey, where are you going, man? All the filthy rabble and their animals have to pass in front of my house, and they leave a mess! Damn mule, I'll tame you! If he weren't walking behind, that unhappy child would be indistinguishable from the packhorses. Did you hear, sonny? I think the parrot learned to speak! Or did the donkey bray? We'll see if today in the court appearance whether you're still so profane in front of the Judge. ~ Don't worry, kiddo... ~ No... You know I won't let anyone take you away. Real canes, they're not sticks! ~ This is my spot. ~ Watch out, I'll drive you away. What do you mean? I'm here every Tuesday! ~ Don't push. ~ And don't pull me! What's up there? ~ Well, it's my place. ~ What do you mean, "my place", if pigs get wings! Any place is fine for selling oranges. Now, don't favor him just because he sells saints. What else is missing, Sergeant? "Pu-pu, um-ump, ki-kins...Pumpkins!" "Te terrazgo, te atasco,..." Tarascan Tea! "The stomach." The wool! "Wet titivite." Salt and sunfish! Idiot! ~ Buy your larks, goldfinches!! ~ Little songbirds! You should learn to sing in school and not in the market. How much are the sparrows? They're not sparrows, they're green canaries. And the lark, is it male or female? Male. Males sing less than the females. That's true, males are less gossipy than old bags. And...how much are they? Two pesos. Two pesos? That's expensive! Knock it down to one peso, and maybe I'll buy it? And that's just so the little female has company. Look, sergeant, you know that good company costs, and bad company sucks. Take home a bird to make your home happy! Right now we've got a court appearance! I think it's time now. I'll be right back, don't worry, OK? ~ And don't let them cheat you with the change! ~ No, Pops. Buy your larks, your finches, your nightingales here! And the Committee of the Orphanage of the Holy Child... represented here by its president... is seeking the custody of the child... considering you unfit to raise him... and too old to provide for him properly. Do they mean to take him from me? He'd live incorporated into society! And what about love, huh? He'd live more like a human. And who's going to have more humanity than me, and more fondness? He'd have a more appropriate upbringing. He'd go to school. But he was already learning to read and write... the only drawback was that we had to start walking at four in the morning to get in time at school. Sure, but he no longer comes to school. Besides, he ought to learn lots of other things. Yes, cheating and jealousy and gossip and hatred,... like everyone who lives where there's a lot of people. And what can you teach him, how to live like an animal? To live, nothing else. Or to show him what I've learned myself. And to know the birds and flowers. And all the nice things in life, and to be honest, as God intended. The law can't force you to give up your grandson. ~ Your Honor! ~ Miss. But we'll impose on you a period of observation... and if the Committee demonstrates your inability to bring him up... or that you abuses him, we'll remove the child from your custody. Well, you can impose this period of time,... but my grandson will always live with me, and live freer than air. ~ Can I go? ~ Yes, sir. Good day, everybody. Fuck off, flies, fuck off! Did anybody miss me hereabouts? Of course, as usual, catching flies! Only the ones that suck blood. Get lost, leeches, get lost! ~ Hi, beautiful. ~ Well, you're like Lazarus. ~ How so? ~ You suddenly reappear from the dead. How beautiful the lass has become in just a few weeks.. Hopefully she's getting used to be guided. Well, not really. If I don't like them to shut my mouth, even worst that they put a hold on me. Can I have another fruit beer, please? I mean, if it won't interrupt your conversation. And I'll have a beer. I mean, if no one minds. In this shop, we serve all who ask as God intends,... without yelling or banging things around. And what you both should do is greet each other properly. Or did you spend the night in the same bed? Go on! ~ Good... ~ ...day. ~ How are you? ~ Fine. Then are you going to take me to school again? Sure, as soon as the term starts. Take it, girl, just because your eyes are prettier and more cheerful than those of the sparrows. And finally, how much will you charge me for my lark? I sold the lark a while ago. This is a new one. Another one? But it looks just the same. ~ Smoke and mirrors. ~ And this one, is it a male, too? ~ Even more than the last one. ~ How much, your best price? Three pesos. Three pesos? A while ago it was two. That was the other one, this one's much better. And how can you tell whether it's male or female? Well, if it lays eggs, it's female, otherwise it's male. Well, just because I don't want to argue with you, I'll give you three pesos. You're giving them to me? As a gift? For the lark, don't play the fool! Come on, what a lovely lark! Oh, I'll bring you to your bird-girlfriend! ~ You mocked, right? ~ Just for her pride. ~ We had a good day, today. ~ Yes, Pops. This is for food and clothing, and this for fun. Now, you go your way and I'll go mine, see you later at this same place. Fine. Come on, buddy, don't mess with my jerkin, my friend! Don't crowd in, don't push! There are so many cool things here! Good afternoon, girl. ~ Good afternoon. ~ Do you have my stuff? Yeah, I put it aside. Well, you're all set. I put in beans, lentils, and all the usual things. ~ Thanks. ~ Do you want me to help you, old man? ~ Thank you. ~ How were sales? ~ Well, good, I sold all my birds. ~ Great, great, man! And you, when will you be heading off? Well, the honest truth, I'm thinking of putting down roots in this town. Oh, don't believe him! There are some here who, when they put down roots, they're like planted trees,... or bound to the people. ~ Some girls one would like to be tied down every time. ~ Sweet talk! I mean it! Very nice talk, but I like a brandy syrup laced with hawthorn. With pleasure. Hawthorn syrup with brandy...and what would it taste like? Like hawthorn syrup with brandy. ~ You want to try it? ~ No, I believe you, I believe you. Wow, it's too sweet. It needs more brandy. Now it's too much brandy! It's too strong. Maybe another bit of syrup. Here, try it now. Almost, kind of. It's still a bit weak. Just a little bit, so it doesn't get out of hand. A bit more and it'll be fine. No, the strong stuff. Now you've made it, indeed, finally it's really tasty. Cheers! Cheers. Well, since I got one, I think I'll have another. One? Don't bother, if you want I'll serve myself. So you can wait on your customers. And don't worry, I'm keeping track here of the ones I took. Go on, then. Hey, hey, hey! Beat it! ~ Oh, what? ~ Take off, then. That's two. Well, did you bring some money? Yes, give me 10 tickets. ~ 10? ~ Yes. ~ Good afternoon. ~ Hello. What do you want? Well, a fruit beer, if you are not too busy. You've seen it with your own eyes. What, aren't you going to say hello to each other? ~ How are things? ~ How are things? How is my major? How is the region? Well, in my area, things are fine. Great! That makes four goes! Three. ~ Four. ~ Five. Six! Five. Six. Five. Seven. There were four, right? There were seven, but I'll only charge for four. That'll be eighty centavos, plus 4 pesos for the goods. Thanks, but the truth is I only drank about one peso's worth. Good night, my good men. Good night, goodbye. Be careful, old man? Well, that wraps up the conversation and the beer. Off you go! ~ No, no, listen, I'd like another. ~ Me, too. That's exactly what you both have to do: find another one. ~ Listen, but why? ~ Do it somewhere else. ~ But I don't get drunk on beer. ~ You go to the fruit beer shop and you go to the bar. Now it's over. Hey, you fell! Don't trip, son. Look, what else can we expect?! What a way of show a boy how to live! And what would you complain about, son? No complaint on my part, just that I didn't reach my fourth ride and I was already dizzy to the bones. Look at that boy! And you, you degenerate Indian, do you think it's respectable to drink? For me, sure! The priest drinks every night, even when he's fasting! What rubbish! It makes me sick! The judge will hear of this. You're showing this youngster the worst possible example. And all of us here will testify before the board. The Matron Commission? You're all braggarts! Corporal, chuck this drunk out of here! Chuck him out? With the dogs and sheep! You heard her, Indian troublemaker! Let's go. ? Goodbye, mother Carlota, and goodbye my old love. ? The old bag is crazy and the corporal is her camphor. ? So today you're not going to help me with the beaded embroidery on my dress? Sorry, I have to get to the orphanage before the kids return from school. What do I do with the lark, where do I put it? As soon as I buy their honeymoon cage, my lark will have her husband. The male lark is horny. ~ On account of the little use they have for it, I think... ~ Corporal! Oh, indeed! And how am I going to tell them apart to separate them? Prince! Damned cat! Her nails, her manicure! That's it, her manicure! Oh, let's paint the tiny claws on my lark! Now my lark will look lovely for her wedding! And we won't confuse her with her mate. Grandfather! Hey, shit, come here!! It's yours, Grandfather, take it, take it! "Take it, take it"! As soon as I find it. It's yours, take it! It'll bite you, Grandfather, it'll bite you! As soon as I find you! Oh, not there! Wow, it got into your pants, and it won't come out, Grandfather! All right, that's enough, you're already toast, animal! Let's jump the stick, and I jumped! Grab it, Grandpa! You already got out, wretched beast! The hen laid an egg! No, Grandfather, no! No, Grandfather! No, Grandfather! Where are you going, where are you going, where are you going? I was just playing, and besides, frogs don't sting too hard. I got you! And now it's your turn to laugh! I was just playing, and besides, frogs don't sting too hard. No, not the feet, Grandfather! ~ I know. Go on! ~ No, Grandfather! No, please! Laugh, man! ~ Are you laughing, right? ~ Oh, what do you want, little wars, Grandpa? ~ Oh, heartily, go on! ~ Go on, go on, go on! Heartily! ~ Did the frog bite you, Grandfather? ~ It wasn't a frog, it was a toad. Careful. Don't make any sudden moves. Keep still, don't run or move, or it'll jump on you. Don't let it smell your fear. Hide it. Be a man. ? Goodbye mama Carlota, goodbye my old love. ? Keep facing it. Don't miss his path. Don't look into its eyes. Now, little by little, give effect an escape. Walk backwards, slowly. Don't turn your back or start to run. Little by little you'll be farther away. Don't run yet! You should get farther away. Grandfather, Pops! ? Goodbye mama Carlota, goodbye my old love. ? Grandfather, Pops! It was going to attack me, a puma! ~ What's the matter, son? ~ There, a puma! ~ A puma, there! ~ So what did you do? What you told me to do. Thankfully your saints didn't turn their back on you. Which saint? Well, your saint, of course! Your guardian angel. What? I have my own saint? Well, of course, all we have. And where is he? I've never spotted him. He always walks with us. But we can't actually see him until we die. And then, we can learn who he is. What would we need him for then? ~ Why did you just ask what for? ~ Say, how is he? Well, it's...it's like a saint, but gets more involved. He would go for your impossible dreams, the ones other saints wouldn't dare try. But God has to pull their ears sometimes so they won't mess in too much. Yeah? How? Like this! This is for you. You gave it away to me just because I said it was beautiful. How ungrateful you are! I'm telling you I brought it especially for you. Why me? For you to love it very much. That way, perhaps you'll think of me sometimes. And so, maybe sometime... Oh, such a sly dog, this one! ~ Come on, it's still small, keep it! ~ No! Thanks. Crap, stop that horse here! Stop it, don't let it go! A mule was driven into the house. Mule, mule, mule! Wait for me, son! My lark! Oh, my pots! Take it easy, don't wield the broom, don't you see that just makes her nervous. Step aside. Naughty mule, mule! Oh, my birds! Settle down! Take that mule away, and lock up all the animals in the inn's stables. Oh, that bastard with his animals! But this won't stay this way. Now, I apologize, Ma'am. "Apologize"? You'll regret this for the rest of your life. OK, so I won't apologize. Wow! What's going on is that you want to get even with me for personal reasons. And of course, since you're the police, you're the boss, and you're the one who's right. Oh, yeah? Then there's a fine of two pesos for disrespecting authority... and twelve silver pesos for property damage,... or four days in jail. Twelve pesos? Are you crazy? I demand at least 80 pesos, or three months' imprisonment. Well, didn't you hear what the gentleman said? Well, unfortunately for all of you, I'm the authority here and I'm giving the orders. I'm not paying this person a penny, even if I rot in jail. Well, OK...as you wish. Four days? Four days. Lock him up. ~ Go on, move! ~ Don't drag me around, I'll go quietly myself! How is it going, son? How many have you sold? Two sparrows,... a goldfinch,... three mockingbirds. And some five old bags haggled so I didn't sell to them. ~ Fine, let's go, eh? ~ Yeah. That's good, son, be smart, don't let them walk all over you. Wait for me here, OK. I'll be right back. Hey, where are you going? Let's run away, OK? You look like an owl. I'll name you "Owl". And you, what did you bring along? And why did you bring that dog if it's not yours? Because the animals don't belong to anyone. That's what you said, right? Sure, but even so you should return it to its owner,... that girl, she's going to think she's lost it. It would be good if she did, right? I said it has to be returned and that's that. The poor thing, I think it wants to have a friend. It doesn't have anyone. Just like me. What about me, aren't I your friend? Of course, Pops. Well, it's too late now. Give it back tomorrow. Let's move it, and take that yapping dog with you. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. You're still not asleep. Put down the dog, it's getting pretty late. I'm teaching it to pray... so it can ask its guardian angel for help... now that it's on its own. Dogs don't pray. When have you ever heard a dog talk? Go to sleep. Then it can learn to look at the stars, right? Where have you seen a blind dog? ~ Give me a break! And go to sleep! ~ Yes, Pops. Good night, Owl. "How voluptuous you are, dear! How voluptuous you are, dear!" Ah, what a cheeky parrot, this one! What, you don't like it? I said to myself, "Poor thing, she must be really sad because she lost her dog",... so I brought this parrot as a gift. ~ A gift? For me? ~ Yeah. Oh, thanks very much. ~ Dear parrot! ~ "Good afternoon!" It's nice, thanks. Come on, I invite you for some sips of brandy and hawthorn. No, no, you're going to think I was trying to bribe you. I wouldn't think so. As may be. I brought it to console you. Now, if the puppy shows up it's going to be trouble, there will be problems. Why? This parrot is brave and it pecks dogs hard. It's going to tear an eye off of the dog! May God forbid! So, if the doggy shows up, you could give it to my grandson. He'd take very good care of it. And how did you happen to know I'd lost it? You'd never believe me: a little bird told me. Did you know that birds can speak? Hey, you, is that so? "You really matter to me! You really matter to me!" Here are your weapons. Oh, and tomorrow let the drunkard and the carpenter go free. That's good, Major. ~ And I charge you to make sure everything's in order. ~ Yes, Major. I won't be back until we find the gang of rustlers whose been plaguing the region. Let's move out, gentlemen. What about you? But you're not worth a damn! It turned out good for him. Grandfather, Pops, a lark! Really? Look how cool, Grandfather, look, a lark. Yeah, it sure is nice. And well fed. And look, it has pretty colored claws. It's very beautiful, son. There are sparrows, they're speckled. Buy those sparrows, girl. Come on! Take them home, Ma'am! That lark, is it male or female? It's female, do you want to see it? No. What's its price? ~ Four pesos. ~ Four pesos? Well, of course, this is a fine specimen of a lark. It's a very rare breed. Look, it has claws as red as blood. That's true! Look, I'll give you the four pesos and come back for her later. Well, who's the accused, the brat, too? No, as far as the boy's concerned, I'm taking care of matters by other lawful means. It's the old coot who's teaching him to be a crook, just like him! That's not true. I never stole anything from anybody. Oh, no? I have witnesses. Is it true that you painted the claws on my lark yourself? Sure. They're also witnesses. Question them, too. Come on, testify, and with the whole truth. Well, I saw them do that idiotic thing with the lark's claws. Well, when I saw it, it was already painted and locked in its cage. And everyone, especially you two, are witnesses that the day I lost my lark,... that old guy took himself to my house and was the last to leave. In that case, what do you have to say for yourself? What do we do, you? Well, nothing, since the major's not here. That gentleman's never around when we need him. We'll see what my brother, the governor, says when he reports to him. Well, he went to chase down some rustlers. But we're the authority here, is that right? Oh, is that so? Well then, when do you expect to enforce the law? Lock him up! But first, give me my four pesos back. Take your lark. Here's your four pesos. But learn that the birds can escape. And by caging them they get dumber, and it's likelier for them to be caught. And then you can sell them again, right? I already returned the money, didn't I? But just for not hearing your whining, I'd give you even more money! Have they heard? Are you trying to bribe me? Well, if he paid her back, he can go, right? This old man committed a robbery and theft is a serious offense punishable by imprisonment. Or didn't you know that, either? Sure, we're not so stupid, of course we at least know about laws and justice. Right? Well, then. What sentence shall we impose? Maybe two years, do you think? Don't be harsh, he didn't loot the cathedral! We'd better wait until the major comes back to decree the sentence. Lock him up! You heard him, old man, inside Move! Let him go! Leave him alone! ~ Leave him alone! ~ Shut up, brat. Don't touch him. I'm staying with you, make them lock me in with you! Nobody's ever going to lock you up. I don't want that old woman to hear you bawling. You have to go to market to get back to selling. You can come visit me later on. You really pissed the old lady off! Thanks. I don't know where the major is, but I can go look for him myself. Don't worry, he'll show up. He won't condone such an injustice. Injustice? May God know! I've spent my whole life caging birds. Why wouldn't they lock ME away? Because that's your job. It's the job of the police, too. What are you doing here? I sold all the birds. That quickly? Everyone came to buy from me and to send you greetings. That's good. Keep the money. Wait. You know who to pay with it. Yes, Pops. Good thing it's so early, so you can go on home. But I'm staying here with you, even if I have to wait outside. You're going straight home now, that's what you're a man for,... to work exactly as if I were by your side. Good night. How are you, old man? I brought you a few things. Thanks. And don't worry, they say the major's heading toward Temazcal. I'll see whether I can get to him before he heads off in another direction. I'll see if I can bring him back tomorrow. Thanks. You go on home right this minute. Let me give you a blessing. Yes, Pops. I love you! Now get on home. Go on! Move! Yes, Pops. Where's your boss? ~ There. ~ Excuse me, have you see the major? I think he headed to the mountain. Wow! Well, thanks very much! Grandfather! Pops, it's me! What are you doing here? I just came to see you. I did the cages, checked the traps, and put out some new ones. I did the laundry, cleaned the house, and then I came to see you. ~ That's good. Have you eaten? ~ Sure. ~ Did you feed the dog? ~ Yes, Pops. Look. Listen, son, don't be coming to see me. Do you understand? You should stay home. I'll find you there when I get out. Now sit there for a while while I look at you. Then head off. ~ Yes, Pops. ~ Go on. Son, don't put out any more traps. Major! Major! No, no, thank you. And why not? To cheer you up a bit. So it'll warm your body. Cigars, yes, since they're company. I don't want anything to drink, because I want to think clearly. I'm thinking things over. Grandfather, don't leave me! Grandfather! Grandfather, Grandfather, get me out of here! ~ I can't. ~ Grandfather, I don't want to stay here. I can't, son. Grandfather, Grandfather, Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather, don't leave me here, take me with you! I can't. Grandfather! I have to go. I'm going. Get me out of here. May God bless you. ~ No, no, don't leave me here! ~ Goodbye, son. No, Grandfather, take me with you! No, Grandfather, no! Stay with me! Stay here, Grandfather! Take me with you, Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather, please! Pops, Grandfather! No, Grandfather! Old man, old man! Wake up. You're free. You're a pair of imbeciles! Wait. Get out of town, we don't want you here! Corporal! Corporal, come here at once! Corporal! I'm here. Don't be cowardly. When do you hope to carry out your duty? What? Go and run this mob off with bullets. Why me? Because it's your duty. What you want is that they lynch me. The army won't lose anything. Did you see it? Stupid dog! Learn to speak, so at least I'll have someone to talk with. Come on, I know who can talk! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. You pray to them. You see? You get along well, right? My son, my son. Grandfather! Pops! For my Pops, OK? Forgive me. Just one. Thanks. Well, at least you were rich. "He went to heaven... "and left us behind." "He flew to heaven and left me behind." Let's go. Come on. In the name of the Father, the Son,... Owl, Owl, Owl! Are you hungry again? You greedy dog! I haven't eaten since yesterday, and I'm not moaning. Well, let's go. What, weren't you looking at the stars? Look, one of the stars is my grandfather, but which one? There are so damned many of them! Which one's you, Grandfather? Which one's you? ~ Annoying boy! ~ Where are you, Grandfather? Where are you? Go to sleep! Don't you see it's nighttime? I feel cold here on my own. Well, hang on! Don't you remember what I said? You've said so many fucking things! You were talking far too much! I told you never to crack, son,... even when things go bad, like they sometimes are meant to go,... even when there are rocks and thorns where you have to go,... when there are things to laugh at, and things to cry over,... even when the pain breaks you and you can't bear the suffering anymore,... sleep a bit. And you should, so you can try again,... in the shadow of your fears, Christ bears the light for you. Grandfather, Pops! Where are you? Sleep, boy, shit! Yes, Pops. And blow out that candle. It's not suitable that the boy still lives alone in the wilderness. Don't you think? Besides, I think he could live with any one of us. The problem is that I'm single. It would start gossip. And besides, men should grow up among men. Oh, yeah, I'd take him, but I have no fixed home anywhere... I'd be shifting around from place to place, sleeping in inns. It would be better if he went to school and had a home. On the other hand, I do have a home and a place... but living with me would be dangerous, say, by bad example. I'm always out chasing down outlaws, vagrants, and nogoodniks. And besides, as you well know, I travel a lot... and it would be awkward if something happened to me for the poor guy. And now where did the brat go? We're taking you with us. The judge has ordered that you live in the orphanage,... but you'll have a lot of little friends,... and we're going to enroll you in school even though we're at the end of the term. ~ Then what? Am I being forced? ~ Yes, son. I'll gather up my stuff. But there are two of us, right? Pops, I know now how birds feel when they're caged up. Let's see: 3 ? 8? ~ 24! ~ 3 ? 7? 21! ~ 3 ? 10? ~ 30! Now we're going to conjugate the verb "amar" in the present tense. ~ "Yo..." ~ "Amo"! ~ "T?..." ~ "Am?s"! ~ "?l..." ~ "Ama"! ~ "Nosotros..." ~ "Amamos"! ~ "Vosotros..." ~ "Am?is"! "Vosotros...Vosotros..."! 3 ? 4 = 12! Oh, what a restless boy! Let's try that again. ~ "Yo..." ~ "Amo"! Grandfather, they all talk about love, but they don't mean it. No one loves me. Thank you very much, and forgive them. Good night, my children are already back. Come on. You go there! No! "Grandfather, take me with you." And all my guardian angel go to the Word, too. Pops, if you can't come, send your guardian angel to take me up to you. Prince! Damned cat! Just try doing something with my birds, then you'll see. Prince, I'm coming! I feel very alone in a crowd. Cat! Prince! Prince! Is that you, damned cat? Who's there? Corporal! What, what? Who's there? Who's here? Orders. Boss, Boss, what happened? Then, what kind of booze did you drink? Boss, wake up. You already conked yourself good, man. Boss! Go on, Owl, hurry! Grandfather, Pops! Come to see me. Everyone went to the cemetery to pay respects to their dead. But you didn't listen to me, I didn't see anything more than a bump on the ground. Did you get my messages? Why so many? Everyone says the same thing. You ought to pray a Paternoster for my sake rather than sending so many messages. Yes, Pops. "Our Father, who Art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. "Blessed God, Blessed who bears the sins of the world,... "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen." Well, then, greet him on my behalf, OK? What happened? Look at him, he's going to break that poor dog's leg! Didn't you know that in order to fly, you have to have wings? Hey, child of God, where have you been? If you keep on escaping, I'll have to punish you,... otherwise, I'll have to tell the president of the board and the teacher. Let's go. Of course, you don't need to study to become a professional idiot! Of course. Push it straight up against the glass. That's it. Sweep straight and tidy down there, or they'll order me to do it myself. The priest wouldn't want to believe it was Satan himself,... who came to drop all my birds. You, don't skip your chores. Well, I washed the windows on that side. She doesn't say scrubbed, she says rubbed. Come on. Now go wash those other ones facing the back street. And don't give me any of your tricks or you'll get a thrashing. Aren't you going too far? ~ Let's trade clothes, OK? ~ Sure. Good, I like it better when you obey. Go on! Sneaky kid! Hey, kid, my kites! Grab him, grab him, he's a thief! Hey, he's not a thief! I told him to grab them. Ah, good, what it means is that I'm in a hurry, OK? How much is that? Fine, but why do you want so many kites? Because they fly, because they get closer to heaven. Did you see, did you see? That's why I think a bigger kite would hold a bigger load. Maybe so, sure. Then let's race,... but without skipping school, right? Take it, go on. It held it, it held it! Wow, what an expert you are! ~ Well, can I have a go? ~ No, you're crazy. How do you figure to control a kite? It'll kill you! I don't know...maybe if I drag it with the horse. Look! Be careful! No, you're crazy. What do you think, son? One, two, one, two, one, two... Get moving, don't be late. One, two, one, two... I'm coming, Grandfather! But what the fuck did you want to do? ~ He set it off. ~ What a kid! ~ Let's go. ~ Yeah. ~ ? Pray for us. ? ~ ? Nice child. ? ? Pray for us, my mother... ? Well, I'm sorry, but that child is an unbearable rebel. I'll send him to reform school. Reform school? But he hasn't been a delinquent! He's a bad example and a danger to the other kids will. He escapes from the school, the orphanage, the catechism class,... ~ Such cheaters? So soon? ~ Next one. ~ Now me! Oh, dear, is it my turn? ~ Quiet. Wait a minute. I said no. Well, ultimately I'm willing to adopt him legally. I have a big house and I'd raise him to a good cop. What, a policeman? Certainly not! Now this one, this is the son of the apothecary. Now me, now me! Is it my turn? They've gone twice. Stay calm. You should be arrested and charged. Now you. Come on. Let's see if your dad'll even give me some medicine for worms. Hit there. Good, I'm sure I can adopt him. I'll show him how to work, I'll make him a good cowboy, and I'll take him to travel the world. The poor kid. Always staying in inns, never being able to go to school? No way! Give me a hint, Grandpa! Grandfather, Grandfather! Tell me, guide me! I'll clobber you for cheating! Now I'll make you dizzy so you don't try to cheat on the authorities. Fine, but I could adopt him. I'd give him a good upbringing and be a mother to him. Ah, no, absolutely not! Why provoke gossip throughout town? Tell me, Grandfather. Guide me. Where is it, Grandfather? Back, back! Come on, come on, man, you hurt my back! What happened? I'm sorry, but none of you can adopt him. The law won't allow it. Why not? We'll meet all the requirements. The first requirement, and that the law makes this very clear,... is that only married couples can adopt a child. and you three, despite not being quite so young, are still single. Corporal! Grandfather, Pops! Why can't I hold the stars that are so close? Certainly in heaven you can gather all the stars. ~ Provided you've been good. ~ Yes. Yes, Pops. What are you looking at, Thicko? At the night sky, Dunce. Wow, I've never seen a night so cool. Of course not, you're always locked away. Look! Good, let's go. What, isn't there a gentleman who'll help me? Come on, aren't you the most gentlemanly? Come on! ~ Good night. ~ Good night. What, aren't you somewhat burdened? It seemed to me that he wanted to throw a horse apple at the major. Can I go with you? ~ Good night. ~ Good night. You have to see a sunrise in the mountains. The birds wake up singing,... and then we go take a bath in the river,... and then we drive away the lizards. Kids, kids, it's time to go to bed. The inn's closing. Good, let's go to sleep. Wait, wait. One of these days we'll skip school, I'll take along everyone,... so you can see his home. Let's go. OK, now we sneak out. And all these stars are your parents, and theirs, and mine, and yours. That'll be my mother, but my dad's still alive and he can be found in the cantina. Well, as for that, drunks don't go to heaven,... because those who go to heaven are those who were good,... and already dead. Look, that star, the biggest and brightest, that's my grandfather. Really? Then, maybe it's the Virgin. They look very alike in the distance. Why do people die? Because they stop breathing, Thicko, life leaves off them. Yeah, and where? What is life, exactly? What? Well, this: to breathe, eat, and sleep. And being jailed, to do the housekeeping, and go to school,... and put up with the thrashing by that old lady,... wash the windows,... and do everything you're told to by those who wear official caps, the policemen, the soldiers, the corporal, and so on. Did you hear that? Did I hear? A wolf. Don't be stupid, it was a coyote! What, don't you see it avoids people? And with the fire, at worst they won't come close. And where to go now? I feel like a piss. Well, back there in the bushes. Do I have to? What if the coyote grabs me and turns me into a star? For the love of God, Corporal! Can't you pass a day without making such a racket? Didn't you see the poor children stayed awake all night at the inn? But they're not asleep, they're dead, since they can't hear me. Come on! By the Holy Virgin! Now, we are nearly catching up! Give me that oar. Not there, man! Hand it over, we've got to turn around! Turn around to get us where we can see the ducks! There, straight ahead, let's take that course so you'll see my home. I'm sure that this time, that devilish child is to blame. But I'm going to send him to reform school, to jail! He didn't get to finish this one, but those ones, my grandfather and me crafted them. Ha! --- Now you say you know how to make cages? And of course, of all sizes. One day my grandfather made a big one, big, big like that! Really? They're already quarreling, Grandfather? Look, look, a golden eagle, look! A golden eagle, a golden eagle! No, it's a vulture, how about that? It's an eagle, dummy! Didn't you learn that eagles are the birds that fly higher into the sky? If I tell you a secret, will you keep it? ~ I will. ~ Me, too. Son, it'd be great to fly like that. Now, I'm going to fly like that, because there should already be a golden eagle trapped... in the big trap my grandfather built. Are you saying you're going to fly to heaven? ~ Sure. ~ And will you come back? If my Pops says so. But don't tell anyone, eh? I'll run away from the orphanage very soon. ~ Bring up the kit. ~ Yes, sir. The horses are ready. Let's go. And if they don't show up? At dawn we'll organize a search party. Here. ? I'll follow a light from the heights, I'll hear... ? a light that calls me, I'll go up... ? the mountain, and get even closer to God to pray. ? I'll shout, and this world will hear me and follow me... ? the whole way, and He'll help... ? to show this cry of love and faith. ? I'll ask... ? that the stars keep shining brightly,... ? that children don't stop smiling,... ? and men never forget how to be grateful. ? So I say: I thank Thee, Lord, for another day! ? I thank Thee, Lord, that the sun rose! ? I thank Thee, Lord, I thank Thee again,... ? So I say: I thank Thee, Lord, for the stars! ? I thank Thee, Lord, for the smiles. ? In thank Thee, Lord, I thank Thee again. ? One more time: I thank Thee, Lord, for the new day! ? I thank Thee, Lord, for hope! ? I thank Thee, Lord, I thank Thee again! ? Lift your face, I'm talking to you. Tomorrow morning I'll be taking you to the State reform school... and we'll see how well you escape from that. And tonight you're going to miss dinner and sleep on the floor. Don't tell anybody. I'm bringing you breakfast before... He's already gone! Owl, come on, come on, Owl, come one! Major, bring that Devil's child here right this instant. ~ Or it will be you who...! ~ Shut up, Missy. Isn't it enough that you caused the death of that poor old man just for your stupid whims? Of course we'll look for him, but we're not going to let you send him to reform school,... nor will we allow you to keep bossing around this orphanage. ~ Listen to me! ~ Belt up! And I'll tell you something else: if something happens to that child, you'll be held solely responsible. Major, Major, I know where he went! Where? Really, I'm sure he scaled the cliff. On the peaky ridge he has a huge huge trap with a golden eagle in it. A golden eagle? What could he possibly want that for? He says he's going to ride it so it'll take him to heaven. Don't talk crap! It's not crap. I know him and I know he means it. ~ Let's go, Major. ~ Let's go. By your leave. Grandfather! I'm coming to you! I finally succeeded! I'm happy. Wait for me! I flew! I'm going to heaven. I can do it. Look! I flew! I'm coming to you! ? I'll follow the star... ? which brings me to you,... ? to your beautiful world,... ? where happiness reigns. ? And I'll be certain that when life embitters my world,... ? instead of suffering, I'll follow the star,... ? which takes me to you. ?
