Stop. Stop here. Quick...... we'll miss the train. What took you so long? Sorry darling. Come in. Wait.... Did you close the door? What's your name? - Nikhil.... why? Father's name? - S. K. Pandey. What do you do? - I work... in an office. Apart from kissing girls what else do you do in your office? What's your favourite food? Your date of birth? Who's she? Girlfriend? Or just time pass? What's going on? What are you doing? Love or lust? Who are you? - You're asking me? Who the hell are you? - You're asking me? Yes, answer me. - See you soon. Hey... wait a minute... Who is he? Hello. Mr. Mukherjee speaking? - Yes. Calling from Inner Eye Detective Agency sir, Mr. Dayashankar Joshi would like to speak to you. Mr. Joshi from Inner Eye? - Yes sir. Ok, connect it. Sir, Mr. Mukherjee is on the line. Yes, Mr. Mukherjee? - Yes. We have interesting news about your case. - Oh. Can you come to our office? No. Tell me over the phone. The girl you selected for your son is having an affair.. with a guy called Nikhil Pandey. We have proof.... photos of the boy and his house. Can you get one of them together? - Yes, if you give us some time. 'Let it go.' - Than... OK. Shall we continue? 'No, not necessary.' I will tell you. I'll send a man to you with the photos and a bill tomorrow. You paid an advance of 3000. 5000 is still due. OK? Who is Dayashankar Joshi? Who? Are you Dayashankar Joshi? - Yes, yes... Why are you following me? You think I don't understand? Who sent you after me? Look, you are misunderstanding... No one appointed us! Shut up. What misunderstanding? Don't pretend. That old fool... I got your name, number, everything from his mobile. Tell him I can't stand him. His breath, his touch, his laugh... I despise everything. I hate him. No, no madam, Mr. Sharma is a nice man. He loves you a lot. He showed me your old photo, said it was love at first sight. He made cold coffee for me. Believe me, it was great. He's slightly possessive about you. Stop talking nonsense. Why did you say no one hired you? If you ever follow me again, I'll shut down your company. Do you understand? Don't forget. Anwar, you've been here for ten years and you still don't know.... sniffers must work secretly. This is basic. How did she know you've been following her? If her husband loves her or not, it's none of your business. In the Mukherjee case, the way you asked names and took photos was not right. You are ruining both your own and the company's reputation. But I had to know if the girl was in good hands. Did they really love each other or was the boy just having fun? What if the girl got pregnant? Shut up! Everyone is not an idiot like you! Find out as much as you need, and flush off the rest. OK? Our company has a good name. My father started it forty years ago. He was a genius, the only Sherlock Holmes in the city. Sir, you said that before. Go to Mr. Mukherjee's house tomorrow and collect the cheque. Take the photo of the girl and the documents he gave us. You have a new case from tomorrow. Sit down. Are you left-handed, sir? Could you give part in cash? OK, sir... no problem. Here's the balance payment. Where is the original picture of the girl? I'll need it. Here sir, I've also got other photos. I handled the case, sir. No picture showing them together? Give me one more day, sir... I'll get one. No. I've checked on four girls. They're all the same. Nonsense! Mr. Anwar, such things don't happen in your Muslim community, do they? You have strict social discipline. Girls and boys don't mix, do they? Well sir, things are changing. - Bye dad. Your son? Looks like you sir. You're looking for a girl for him? - Yes. For this fellow? Sorry Pradip. - Why are you so late? Sorry, sorry... please don't mind. Try to understand. I told my parents... How long can we wait? Let's celebrate. Where will we celebrate? Any 5-star... Really? - Sure. What gift will you give me? - Surprise. Pradip, I missed my date. Meaning? You idiot! You don't understand anything. I told you to take precaution, but you didn't. What if something happens? Nothing will happend, don't worry. May I sit here? That man is taking our picture. That one? Yes, the one with black glasses. Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! He's gone. Mr. Mukherjee? Who are you? Wow! What biceps! Isn't there a big picture of a horse in your house? My god, it's great. Who are you? Your father is a lefty, but has great handwriting. Isn't your father looking for a bride for you? Who the hell are you? - Wait, wait... And you're going round with another girl? Now she is pregnant! You should marry this one. She's good looking. Why are you bluffing your father? How many bellies do you want to blow up? You son-of-a-bitch! Salam, Anwar. - Salam, Uncle. How are you? You didn't meet my parents. They were a fantastic couple! Deeply in love with each other, like in that film - 'Amar Prem Kahani' Sometimes I think, if they were so much in love, then why just me? My uncle had fourteen children. Don't ask how he had fourteen. I think father wanted her to look young forever... Are women just child-producing machines? Too many children wears out a woman. What do you think? Say something..... I'm doing all the talking... Speak up, my dear. Dad was a postman. You know what a postman is? He wore his uniform, set out on his cycle and.. delivered a thousand letters a day. Every letter had a story. One man got a job.... another one lost his. Someone had a son... Someone had a daughter. Strange, isn't it ? Did you ever get a letter? Who would write to you? Your old master? He kicked you out of his house because you had a skin disease. If you hadn't met me, you'd be wandering around the streets today. Me too... I was also new in this city, all alone. You need a companion in the city. And you started following me... I looked back and you howled. I understood you also needed a friend. I've had too much to drink. Lalu, do you remember your mother? I really miss mine. My... Wait... Lalu...Lalu.. Come here... sit...sit. Mummy's father was a rich man. He died when she was a child. I spent my school holidays with grandmother. They had a big house... I'll take you to there some day. I'll take you to meet someone... ...my dream girl. Ayesha. Oh my god! She was so beautiful. Tall, fair, long black hair, Dimples.... I liked her so much. She loved me, but our backgrounds were so different. She had no guts... No guts means no future... No future.... no life! Her parents married her off... She's gone. I've had too much. What now? Potty? Just when I was getting into a good mood... such a nice mood... Lalu, let's go potty. Have a grand shit... the envy of your friends. Shame, shame, shame ! Look Lalu... look at the city. How strange ! All the ghosts are rising up. Even the ghosts in this city stab each other in the back. They suspect each other. Have you ever seen a ghost? Come. What's wrong? What's wrong? I'm constipated... My god ! Don't know when I'll shit again. What's your problem? Haven't had any sex for years. My goodness ! What happened to you? I haven't slept for ten years. I've lost the pleasure of sleep. Ohhh ! Come. This way.. Please wait here. Plus what you told the office, I need more information. Ok. Ask me. Did your father stay alone in Jassidi? Did you and your mother go there? Sometimes. He came home every weekend. Did he have any servants? No, he made his own breakfast. Lunch was at the office. He ate out for dinner or brought food home. What did the police say? Didn't you pursue the case? We wanted to but they kept saying it was a regular suicide case. Did he have any friends there? Do you know anybody? He had a few friends, but we only knew Uncle Manoj... Manoj Srivastav. They were colleagues. We met him every time we went to Jassidi. Didn't he know something? Did you ask him? He said, he didn't know anything at all. I also can't understand... My father was supposed to have dinner with him that night. I feel like Uncle Manoj is covering up something. Covering what? Any idea? No, but I'm sure he knows something.... OK...thanks. Do you have a photo of your father? - Yes. Is this you? - Yes. He loved you a lot. What's the time? Forget it. What's the time? It's bad times. - What's the time? - Eleven. Stop. Stop. Mr. Manoj? Yes. I'm Anwar. Okay. You recognised me? I was sitting at a distance when you went to... our office yesterday. I intentionally kept quiet. I wanted to meet you privately, so I phoned you last night at your hotel. I couldn't say anything to the police, but I need to tell you everything. This must be confidential. Sudhakar was my friend. Before his death he told me about his gay relationship with Adarsh I promised not to tell anyone. He had to kill himself. That devil made his life hell. I'll tell you everything. You can meet him in town tomorrow. Uncle , some tea please. Two cups. Come in. Have a seat. Sudhakar didn't want to continue our relationship any more. Why? I don't know. He was never a very bold man. But it was he who seduced me. Actually, when he entered my life, I had someone else. But he insisted. Everything happened very fast. It got serious. I loved him. How long did you....? Ten years. Not one or two... but ten years. Sudhakar went to Kolkata regularly, stayed with his family... You never stopped him? Why would I? He missed his daughter. He used to go to meet her. As long as he came back to me, I didn't have any problem. What's my problem if he goes to meet his daughter ? Why did he kill himself ? I don't know. He wasn't the kind to commit suicide. He was a jovial fellow. In fact, whenever I was down, he'd sing and dance ... and cheer me up. Did you quarrel before he died ? Yes. The night before that... we had a big fight. I got very angry and said I'd tell everything to Pushpa. Pushpa? His wife. We knew each other. Didn't Pushpa suspect anything? Sudhakar was a different man in front of his family. He was drifting away from me. I could feel it. He was planning to take a transfer to Kolkata. When I found out, I was very angry. I asked him, how he could do that to me. I had no problem about our relationship,.. but he hid it till his last breath. You know small town society... bunch of hypocrites! Everything has to be kept under cover. I feel suffocated living here like this... Excuse me. You said you respect our relationship, that's why I opened up... and shared my life with you. Believe me, I never wanted him to die. I still love him. Can you please stop? If it's the big job, we don't have that much time. No no. It's the small one. Hey, hurry up! How long will you take? What are you doing? Hey you ! Now what? The hell with you! Ayesha. Ayesha, do you remember? I remember you all the time. I could never forget you. Do you live here? What do you do? I teach in a school. Oh, yes. You always wanted to be a teacher. And you wanted to be 'nothing'. What do you do now? I follow people, I sniff around and... find out about them. Today, I've found you again. Are you happy? Does your husband love you the way I did? Can we start again? If you have children, we'll raise them up together.... You haven't changed a bit, Anwar. You always lived in a strange world of your own. I don't belong to that world! You loved me a lot. You still do. How could you give yourself away so easily? I'm getting late. I should go now. Ayesha, won't we ever meet again? You? Sorry, I came without informing you. Come inside. Sudha, you have such a nice name. Who gave you this name? Your daddy? Our agency will call later and tell you everything. But... Don't tell them I've been here. - I won't. If they know about it, I'll lose my job. Please. Did you find anything? Yes, I found that your daddy was a great man. Everyone loved him. They talk about him even now. He was friendly, helpful, charming. He loved you a lot, but... But? But what? Tell me.. He was depressed. He wanted a transfer, but... But everything about his transfer was settled. He was confused. Actually, he had a relationship there in Jassidi. Mr. Anwar, my father was a decent man. He loved my mother. It's not possible that there was another woman in his life. Not a woman. A man. What? What? Your father had a relationship with another man. Rubbish! It's not rubbish. What proof do you have? Proof. - Who is this man? Proof, I don't have... - Than... How can you say such a thing without proof? I'll file a case against your company. Get out of this house! Don't get upset. Doesn't a man have the right to live his own way? Your father was a good man. These thing happen. Shut up and get out! What's the matter with you? He was your daddy, and he always will be. Get out or I'll call the police. Get out. Son, can you help me cross the road? Where do you live? - Down that street. Can you go alone? OK then. Goodbye. Why don't you come to my house? - Ok. Where do you live? What is your name? I live nearby... Bhowanipur. My name is....Mohammad Anwar. Where are you going? Sit. You have to eat these. I have made them myself. Try this first. You look exactly like my son. There... Where is he? Doesn't he stay with you? He lives far away, in Dubai. He's an engineer. Does he visit you? How can he? He's so busy. He works in a big company. He has a lot of responsibility. But I visit him quite often. You go alone? Yes, who is there to go with me? I travel a lot.. I went there this morning to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday.. and returned by evening. Do you understand ? I go to my ancestral home in Benaras, where I grew up... and Kulu Manali where I went for my honeymoon when I was sixteen. That's my husband. He was very handsome. He loved me a lot. Anyway, past is past. Now I go to deserts, jungles... wherever I like. I love to go places. Whenever I feel like it... I just go. Anwar, don't you go anywhere? Come, let's go. Remember, a long journey begins with just one step. Gopal, come here. Has Lalu eaten? He won't eat when you're not there. I gave him meat last night. He didn't touch it. Did you bathe him? I don't have time for my own bath. See, such a crowd at the shop. Did you take him out? - No. I couldn't. He's been locked up for three days? - My boss didn't let me go. Did he go for potty? Maybe he did it in the room. Give me the keys. - Catch them. Gopal, come here. Why this hunger-strike for three days? No food, no potty, locked up for three days.... I have to go out and work. Otherwise, how could we survive? How could I buy your food? Let's go somewhere else. Where do you want to go? Mathura, Benaras, Kashmir, Darjeeling? Tell me. I met an old lady today! I went to her house. She gave me sweets... and sat next to me like my mother used to. She was really something. Every day she goes to a different place. Great! Let's go... let's run away. No more sniffing, no more bothering strangers... A place where you can eat, shit, run and have plenty of sex. Every day I'd get you a new bitch. If bitches got boring, you could have a dog. Whatever you like... Darling...look at me...listen... I can't live without you. Tell me... I love you... I love you.. - I love you, too. You know, darling... I went to Sudha's place. A lovely girl. She looked like 'Hoori'... but that's too Muslim. Or like a 'Devi'... but that's too Hindu. Lalu... What are you? Hindu or Muslim? Who am I ? I'm not sure. Sudha's father is dead. She loved him very much. Her father was gay. You know what that means? A guy who slept with guys. But Sudha's father slept with his wife too. What are they called? I forget. I told Sudha about her dad. Why hide it? He was a good man. Does that change if he sleeps with a man? Bring a kilo of 'Seemai'... 'Lalu are you remembering anyone? Your first love?' 'Here, have another drink.' Unbeliever! A Muslim can't take alcohol. It's a sin. If you drink, you'll have to leave this place! Come Lalu... sit darling. Did I tell you I met Ayesha? She was as lovely as ever but... looked sad. Why are so many people sad? She kissed me, here, right on my lips. When you are kissed by someone you love, Time freezes.. the sun goes behind the clouds, and you suddenly feel so light! Come everybody. You don't know these things... not love, not pain, not even a kiss. Lalu, has anyone ever kissed you ? Anwar open up. Open the door! No, I won't. Can't you hear? Anwar.. Go inside. What do you think you're doing? You can't take alcohol here, I'm warning you. Family people live here. In an Arab country, you'd be stoned to death. And you can't keep a dog here. Dog? What dog? Shut up. This is only Lalu. Shut up. Follow rules or get out. Don't worry, I'll make Lalu a man some day. We'll throw you out of here. Where is this office? I'm from Kishangunge. My name is Baiju. I need your help. Come inside. Sit down. Relax. Tell me... Can I have some water? Anything else? -You sit down. Don't get beaten up. I left home early this morning. Tell me. What are your charges, sir? Forget about the charges. What's the problem? Anwar... - Sorry sir. One more fish. I'm in a taxi, on the bridge. You sir? - I'm vegetarian. I feel bad that you're treating me. Eat as much as you like. Do you know the house that your son worked in? Yes sir. For six months I went there to collect his salary. Last month they told me.. he never came back from the vegetable market. I don't know this city but I looked in so many places... I kept sitting in front of that house. The owner saw me but didn't say a word. He walked past me but never said anything. How old is your son? - Just turned eleven. You sent such a young child to work? What could I do, sir? I can't even feed myself. The flood destroyed everything. My older son was run over by a truck. So this one had to go to work. He had enough to eat and he earned some money. Did the owner inform the police? He said he lodged a complaint. And then? Police said they couldn't find any clues. Why didn't you go to the police yourself? They told me there can't be two complaints on the same case. They wouldn't listen to me. I tried to ask my son's boss. I pleaded with the police. No one helped me. Can you do anything, sir? But our charges are high. I paid at your office, sir. Didn't you see? Yes, I saw. Where'd you get all that money from? I sold my land. Now what'll you live on? I have nothing, but if you find my boy... I can send him some place else. What if he's not found? Surely he'll be found. God looks after the poor. I need some more rice, sir. I'm Mohammad Anwar, private Investigator. I want to talk about his boy who worked in your house. 'Namaskar' Some water, sir. Bring a glass of water. I've told him all I had to say. What could I do if his boy didn't return from the market? The police are searching for him. If found, he'll be returned. Water. I'm busy. I have guests. Go now. Just one question, sir. I have nothing more to say. Please go. Hello. Hello. Listen.... Come..only you. Please come. I'm Sudesh Kumar. - I'm Anwar... I know all about it... That fellow is my tenant. He hasn't paid rent for seven months. This month, when I asked for the rent he said... I won't pay. Do what you like. Listen, he's a criminal. Criminal? - Yes ! I'm not sure what it is, but he's involved in something. He gets kids to work in the house and after a while they disappear. 'Listen to a song about these evil days...' 'Lord Ram obeyed his father and went off into the jungle' 'These days where will you get a son like that?' 'Listen to a song about these evil days...' What song is that, maestro? Will you teach me? Where does Khalil Bhai stay? - Why? I need to know. - What the hell for? I told you I need him. - Then go and find him. Rat poison.... Cockroach poison.... Bedbug poison..... Khalil Bhai? - That way. Salam, Khalil Uncle. Salam. Who are you? What's your name? I'm Mohammad Anwar. Did you pray? As a rule you should say your prayers five times a day. If you don't, it's a sin. Tell me what you want. You know me, I'm the son of Maqbul of Gopalgunge. Maqbul? Who Maqbul? Your father-in-law's sister's son. Maqbul? Yes, how is he? How is your mother? They both passed away years ago. Khalil bhai, I need your help. Come inside. You can shut the door if you want. Sit down. Tell me. Don't worry, they are trustworthy. Where are you going? - Leave me. Now... Iqbal speaking. Khalil Sir? Tell me. Where are you going? What? I'm coming Sir. You kindled the fire, you shouldn't have doused it! Khalil Sir instructed me, so I'm taking you. I'm not into this business. It's bull shit. But I keep an eye on it. I know who's doing what. I told Shankar I'm bringing an agent. They won't doubt me, but it's still risky. Shankar is dangerous. You keep quiet over there. Don't haggle about prices. I'll do the talking. OK What's the boy's name? Bharat Maity. Hindu? - Yes, why? Just asking. If we're lucky we might find him, but they don't keep the kids in one place for long. 'Look into my poisonous eyes... I'm winking at you.' 'See my body slither towards you....' 'My slim waist, warm breasts....' 'Salam' Shankar. - 'Salam' Come, Anwar. Don't... Are you Bharat? Bharat?.... Bharat?.... Hey ! Who the hell are you? What are you doing? What am I doing? What're you doing? How can you do this.... buying and selling children? Who are you? Shakarbhai he is runing... Bring your own wife and kids. Make them dance! Damn it! Are you human beings or a bunch of swine? Don't you have kids? Or are you impotent and don't have erections? Erections? What erection is he talking about? He's mad! Bastards! I'll tell the cops and have you jailed! Damn you .... Hello... It's you? Come, come inside. Sit here. I've been thinking of you... How are you? Good. And you? I'm good too. No, no... you're lying to me. What are all those marks? - It's nothing. Did you fight with someone? - No. Keep this. It's a magic ointment. It will make all the pain vanish. Where did you go yesterday? Today? I've stopped travelling for a few days. I was slightly sick, you know. The day before yesterday I went far away... to Jaunpur, but I came back quickly. Couldn't stay there.. Why? I don't know.... just a little pain in the chest. But you don't worry... I'll be better soon. And then finally I'll go out... First to my sister in Bilaspur, from there to Guwahati, and from Guwahati... Have you gone anywhere in all these days? Yes, to my grandmother's house. It's a lovely old mansion in a vast empty landscape... surrounded by hills and a few trees. My grandmother had a gramophone with a huge speaker My aunt would play records to make me take a nap. She danced along with the songs. It was a treasure-chest. You'd get old coins, key rings and whatnot from it's long, dark tunnel... Have you done your homework? Hurry up. Appu... Appu... Call an ambulance. Give him water. Side please. Appu, come here. There was blood on his face, Ma. Keep quiet. You don't need to worry. Why did you run away like that? What if you're late for school? Don't ever do that again. Hello..Hello.. Hello? Why don't you say anything? Yes, I'm taking Appu to school. Yes, it's late. He had to go to his tutor first... He's fine. What number are you calling from? Where is your mobile? It's been switched off for a month. Why are you calling me from different numbers? They're not Kolkata numbers! What's going on? Where have you been? Do you understand my situation? How long can I go on telling people that you're on an office tour? You're not thinking about anyone else. Not even your own son! You just want to do whatever you like! What a blunder it was to marry you. Yes? I'm Malini Shukla. I made an appointment over the phone. Please sit down. Tell me. You're Mr. Joshi? Yes... No... Tell me the case. Well, I... Good morning sir. Yes madam. I'm Dayashankar Joshi, owner of this agency. What can I do for you? I'm Malini Shukla. I saw your newspaper ad and phoned you. Tea or coffee? - No, thank you. How can I help you? I need to find somebody. I'll pay your fee, but you must do the work. It will be done. Inner Eye is a very reputed agency. His father was the last Sherlok Holmes. Trust him. Tell me, what's the problem? I work in a private company. My husband, Amol Shukla, is an executive in a big firm. We have a son. Your husband may be a big shot but we're not so small. We'll find out all about your husband. From the time he goes out untill he returns. ...with pictures. You don't understand. He left home a month ago. He resigned from his office and disappeared Did you inform the police? No. It's too personal. He keeps phoning me. He asks about us... about Appu. Appu is our son. Strange! Don't you ask him when he'll return? I do. He doesn't say. He says he'll return when he feels like it. Then he disconnects. Do you have the numbers he calls you from? There are quite a few. I've tried them... Mostly public booths from different towns No problem. Don't worry. Give us the list of numbers and we'll do what's needed. OK? I need to know... were you on good terms? Was everything OK? Is he involved with another woman? I don't know! Maybe... But you have to find that out. Hello. I just got a call from this number... Is the caller there? A tall, fair gentleman... His name is Amol... What's the location? OK. Thank you. Taxi! I have to go in search of a strange fellow. He has a wife and son, a good job... but he left home. We have to leave our home, too. You know how that old grouch is troubling us. I worry about you, Lalu. What would you do without me? I had so many plans for you... to train you to be a great dog, to win every dog show. People would come just to look at you. But I couldn't do anything. Come here. Couldn't do anything. Don't cry. I love you so much. You never touched alcohol before. Now sometimes you drink more than me! Let's have a party tonight. We'll have rum with Coke. What do you think? Good combination, isn't it? I really love you. But you should leave me. My life is such a mess. I want you to have a better life. Let's go. Rum with Coke? This is a special day. Special food... Special drinks. First the Coke. Drink, Eat it, Lalu. Take it. Cheers, Lalu. Don't be sad. Tell me, what else would you like? Shall I dance for you.... a striptease? See Lalu. See my striptease. Oh my god ! Lalu, do you see what I see? Are you really leaving this place? What? Where are you going? Will you give me your new address? You're a detective. Detectives can do anything! They can shoot with both hands. I've read about it. I read a lot of detective novels. I love them. What's your name? - Nafisa You're an eavesdropper, aren't you? You're a detective, so you know everything. Do you have a pistol? - What? All detectives have a pistol. I've never seen a real gun. Please show me one. Just once. Nafisa.... Where are you? Coming. Nafisa.... Where you goes? 'I am risky, soda whiskey' 'Who do I belong to?' 'Whiskey, whiskey, lovely whiskey' 'Drink me straight and feel great!' See grandfather. Dear, where are you going. Look's good. Genuine? - Yes. Male? - Yes. Age? - Eight and a bit.

Sir, would you mind if I'd come to see him? Would you allow me? Thank you sir. Listen sir... Keep this money. Give him a treat on my behalf. Lalu. Lalu. Lalu.. Yes? Where is she ? Who ? Who do you want ? The old lady who lives here. Her son is in Dubai. She lives alone. I don't know any old lady. We just moved in here last week. You can ask the landlord if you want to. Lalu.... Lalu.... Lalu.... Hey, that's my dog... It's you ?! Lalu, come on. There he goes ! 'Anwar?' Yes, sir. I've just arrived. I'm looking for a lodge. I'll keep you informed, sir. 'OK.' But sir, the place is amazing.... out of this world. There's a peculiar kind of sound. 'A peculiar what?' A strange sound... very familiar. I think... Sir, when I was a boy, I used to swim across a river to a wide meadow... 'Hello..Hello..' I heard this wind sound there. It brings back those days. 'What are you saying?' Sir, I've always wanted to return to my village... I'm feeling good about this, sir. 'Anwar, don't talk nonsense.' 'Finish your job and come back fast.' OK. 'Find Amol. - OK sir.' Yes sir, don't worry. 'I'll call you again.' - OK sir. Hello. - Hello. 'Why don't you answer?' I didn't hear the phone. 'You've got sand in your ears.' Sir...network problem. That's a lie. You're just not answering. Maybe a missed call ? Can't hear you... Now I can hear you, sir. 'What's that sound?' 'Anwar.... Anwar... Where are you?' TAILORS WANTED Brother... Will you hire me? Have you worked before? Not as a tailor but I can fix buttons. I can learn stitching shirts and pants, too. He's nuts! Amol.... So Malini has hired a sniffer to search for me? Does she think I have another woman? No it's not that. She wants you to return. He has a wife and son, a good job... but he left home. It could be something else. Don't you want to go back? I don't know. It doesn't really matter. It would all be the same thing. Everyone's life is 'same'. My job is to follow people. I've been doing it for ten years. It could have been different. maybe not. It doesn't really matter. But you've got responsibilities... a wife and a son. Yes, but what if I don't feel like going back? But your job, your friends and relatives? I'm fine like this. I don't miss anyone. But Appu, your son....? If I ever do go back, it would only be for him. Are you planning to stay here? No.... I might go somewhere else. Where? There're so many places... When I was in college, I wanted to go to Antarctica. Live in the North Pole, Igloo, stay in an igloo, marry an Eskimo girl and eat fish night and day.... Then... Then somewhere else... Where're you going? Nature's call.... Lalu... Amol..... Amol..... Amol..... Lalu... come on. Look at mom and dad.... They died long ago, but even now dad delivers letters and carries mom on his bicycle. Strange! Ayesha .... Haven't you gone yet? Do you want something more? I want to see you. Haven't you ever seen a woman? It was always you, who I wanted to see. Then I will play the record. If you sleep early. My eyes speak to your eyes... Your wishes whisper to mine... Let my heart smile. May your heart smile, too. All these days I had only one world, Now with you I have two..... My eyes speak to your eyes...
