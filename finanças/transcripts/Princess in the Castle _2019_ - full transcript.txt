I should do all your applications, well done. - No, it's not that at all, this is something-- - These punk filmmakers, they don't know what they're doing. They've got no respect. They don't know how hard I worked the people I looked after. My responsibility. My daughter is not going to get the role I put her up for. - Dad, what the hell are you talking about? In fact, who the hell are you talking to? You didn't apply for this role for me, I did it. - No, you didn't. I see what goes in and out of every computer and device in our house. Don't lie to me, I got you this role. I did the application for you, princess. - Dad, I'm not princess and you didn't get me this role. I shot the audition tape at Veronica's house so I applied separately. - Show me. - I can't do it on my phone, I need the computer. - Well the laptop's in the boot. I'll play it later and you'll see that we applied. - Oh don't tell me you sent in two applications. Oh God, you're just embarrassing. Heaven forbid I actually get somewhere with this and have to deal with people, what is wrong with you? Dad, I hate to say this but you're making this really difficult for me now. - Should've worn a low cut top, shown some more flesh, worn better lipstick, you've a studio, you could've done the tape properly, princess. - Jesus Dad, what is wrong with you? It's something. Let me have a moment of something I achieved myself. Let me do this. I'm 19, I could be at university but I delayed because you decided to come back. - [Dad] I didn't say you couldn't go! - Dad, you just said I should've worn a low cut top and shown some flesh. - Must've been thinking aloud. - What studio are you talking about? - [Dad] I got us a studio. - You got a what? - I found this place to rent. I watched a YouTube channel, followed a filmmaking guide, got all the equipment to do the tape properly and we can be filmmakers. Now we'll get you the real work. - That's great, Dad, but you're my Dad. When did you become a filmmaker? - Yeah, I'm your Dad and you're not in university because you didn't work hard enough. Me and your mother, we tried so hard-- - Dad, you were in Japan for like five years. You'd come back Christmas, summer if we were lucky. Now you're back and you're so different. - I'm not different, Connie. I just got depressed, that's all. - Mom said you met a new wife out there. A Filipino woman. But she died so you decided to come back. I actually fucking wish you'd never come back. Look at me like I'm that girl on American Beauty. - You're my daughter. You look stunning. I'm here to help. - Help, right. - Your mother lies to you, Connie. - Does she, really? - Yeah, your mother lies to you. That woman lies through her teeth. I'm gonna have to do something about her. - You're saying this to me? Mama drinks like a fish but you're acting like you wanna kill her. - She's done nothing. - Dad, you just said that woman lies through her teeth and you're gonna have to do something about her. - [Dad] Thinking aloud again. - You've gotten so weird ever since I started doing this. - [Dad] I want you to do this. - Let me do it, let me see where it goes. - Of course. I'm just having issues with your mother. Go on, go to work. - Do you remember where I work? - I got you the job, didn't I? - Are you picking me up or is Mom? - I'll pick you up, princess. - Stop being weird, stop calling me princess. - Connie, I'm sorry. Princess was the name we'd given the baby. - Dad, I don't care. I'm not being callous but all that happened 50,000 miles away. I was never a part of it. I don't want to hear about it so don't tell me about it ever again. - [Operator] You have a new message. New messages. - [Emile] Hi Connie, this is Emile Francis from The Frost Glistens. Would you take a minute to be able to get in touch with us? We have a few things we'd like to sort out with you. If you could get back to us, you could give me an email or alternatively you can give me a call at 0787-233181, that would be wonderful. Thank you very much, Connie, I hope you have a wonderful day. - [Operator] To return call. - Today I'm talking about New York, I'm talking about hair, I'm talking about technology and I might have a new sponsor.

Come on, you can respond to that. - I can't. - Why not? - I just can't, alright? - At least go back to school. - I've got a job. I'm smart, I don't need to go back to school. - You think you're clever because someone told you you are. I'm a grade A fucking student, I would never dream of recording myself ever. Yeah, you're a little bit smarter than the others but you're not clever. - Stop bullying me. - No, I'm trying to be real with you. You were cool before but this acting, it's going to your head. You never did it before and now you think you're better than all of us. - I don't. - You do! You're like that with everyone, you've turned into this brat. - [Cameraman] You ready to go, Connie? - Yeah. (coughing) - [Cameraman] Three, two, one. (beeping) - Hey October 2007, hey Internet, hey world, hey those creepy guys who know who I mistakenly had some kind of Internet thing with. Hey my few thousand-ish growing fans, I'm Connie Castillo and welcome to another episode of my show slash talk slash rant, Princess in the Castle. Are you my prince? I'm kind of looking for one but I don't really admit that to anyone except the Internet which kind of tells you where I'm at with life. So on today's show we're talking about weirdo fucking parents. We've all got them but I seem to have Dr. Weird-en-stein from Weird-ganistan as the thing responsible for my creation on this planet. So send me your comments please. We are live and I'll see them when they buzz through. Oh, I see ya and I agree with ya C-Dos. So, basically I kind of want to be an actress but I do have mega self doubt. See, the thing is I can actually be so fucking dumb, it's unreal. Like I surprise myself sometimes with what I just don't get. And I've said this before on here but my grades are terrible which means I have no qualifications which means I still work in a shopping centre instead of going to university all because I'm a lazy fucking bitch, right? Who's not gonna agree with that? See, on here I can be so honest 'cause you're only gonna judge me by ripping me to pieces in those comments section which, like, wow, where does some of that shit come from? Anyway, I'm gonna be here for a while but I need to pee so stay online and feedback with me. - [Cameraman] And that's good. - I got a really big part today. That's what I've been wanting to tell you. I thought you'd listen. I thought you'd want to know rather than just abusing me. - I'm not abusing you, Connie. All you want is fame and people looking at you, telling you how stunning you are, you are stunning, Connie. I applied for the same film. - Don't you know the outcome? - The cast has got announced. - And you're in it too? - I can't make the dates. I can't make the dates, I've got work. Connie, I was speaking to the guy every step of the way but there was nothing he could do so he's going with someone else. He said he'd keep me in mind for future projects and he asked after you. - And what did you say to that? - I said you were pretty good. Didn't say how insipid you've become. - Did you see the casting notice? - Bebe Marie, Lucy in the feature, the Frost Glistens. - Is that not cool? - Bebe Marie, you know your YouTube has just gone next level, right? Would have been cool if I was in it. - Am I really so self centred? - Yes, you are, to me and to everyone else. You've become a dick. - You don't wanna speak to me anymore? - I'm not your boyfriend. You told me that on enough occasions. There's only so many rejections I can take before I can't be bothered anymore. You don't flirt with someone for five fucking months without expecting some sort of a reaction. - Great. - I'm not really sorry. I'm stopping it now. I'm drawing the line, I've got to. - Wow. - It could have been so different. - Guess I'll see you around then. - No actually, you won't. Me and Mom are moving. You were cool for a bit but the boys will fancy your Mom. And we're all just creeped out by your Dad. What he did, what he said to me, that was just. Even my stepdad sided with me on that situation. He had a drink too, I wanted to smash his face in. - Yeah, he's getting really pushy. - I'm surprised he hasn't fucked you yet to be honest. - Oh fuck off, what? - Yeah, it's that weird, Connie. That's what it looks like. I guess I kind of loved you for a bit but that was so long ago I'm almost embarrassed to think about it. Yeah, just look at me like that. I've seen them so many times before. It's called the I'm so wrapped up with guilt that I can't face up to what I think look. It's such a shame. You broke my heart, Connie, you broke my heart. - Is that it then? - What do you think I've done? - I don't know, David, I never knew what you've been up to thousands of miles away. - I married a woman I fell in love with. She died giving birth to my daughter who was called Princess. Princess died a few weeks after from malaria. I was never coming back home, Bonnie. - Do you know your Dad comes on your YouTube show? - What are you talking about? - I don't know, Connie, it's weird. I think everyone thinks he's part of it, that's why you get all those comments. - It's the Internet. What part does he come in on? - And what Dr. Ron said, you're only this far away from needing anti-psychotic medication. You're ill. - I'm not ill! - Okay so you're wrong. You are sick in your mind, in your body and in your soul. - I'm looking out for Connie. - You aren't looking out for Connie, you've got her on a leash. She can't do anything without checking in with you first and believe me she's going to be broken because of it. - What part does he come in on? - I don't know, just Clarissa told me, I haven't seen it. I think its when you go for a pee, he makes a thing of that. - Stream plays out live, I've got enough subscribers, I can do that. I don't care what I say 'cause no one's recording it, right? - Well, someone might be. - What are you talking about my Dad coming in, how? - Well apparently first there was like this figure that came across the screen and then he bumped his head through the dog's house. Well then he did the episode when you get yourself drunk. - Yeah. - See, I don't think you got yourself that drunk. When you go through the comments it says that some guy came and put pills in your coke. - There's something wrong with my Dad but he's not like that. That's just people getting on my back 'cause the show's getting like by a lot of people. - Connie, I don't think we should be seeing much of each other anymore. - Why not? - 'Cause you don't realise what you've got and now you treat the rest of us like we're substandard. And yeah, your Dad got so weird, like I would be scared to get in a car with him because he could just kill me and bury me in a field or something, that's how weird he's got but you just kept bringing up to him so you to stop it. I don't know what you're trying to achieve or if you just don't realise what's going on but it's wrong. You're older than me but the way you're with him it's like when I was with my Dad when I was 12. When I was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore. It's just control. You play up to it and it makes you look immature. And you're not immature, Connie, but if someone like me is telling you that then something is not right. Look, I'm sorry, I know you've got your ups and downs in your mood but I just can't cope with this. - Alright. - I don't think you're someone I want to know anymore. - Alright, bye. - Connie needs me. - Connie doesn't need you David, you're obsessed with her. You haven't seen her in five years, you come back, she's grown tits and and ass and a face to die for and suddenly you don't see your daughter anymore, you see some girl on the street you can save with businessman with a trust fund routine. It may work in China or Thailand or wherever it is you've been but it does not work here. Okay, let me tell you something about Connie before I ask you to get out of our lives again. I don't think much of Connie. I am her mother, she is my daughter, I love her, if anything happened to her I would be heartbroken but for who she is and the way she lives her life right now I loathe her, I loathe my own daughter and I will tell you why, it is because you have helped me make a fucking idiot. I don't know what it is I did, maybe it was undiagnosed foetal alcohol syndrome or something but whatever it is that girl is just a shadow. She's gotta get her head out of her phone and stop living in this land of fairytales and whatever these jobs that you're putting her up for. She's not capable nor is she ready and I should know because I was at that age. Do you remember, Bonnie the actor? Award nominated, won, nominated, won, I mean best fucking film, best fucking actress, best fucking song, best fucking fuck, I did it all, David. And you were just a stain on the invitation. (laughing) You gave it all up to give birth brat-icus achieve-icus nothing-us. That kind of failure does not sit well with me. Can you imagine if I showed up for those kind of jobs that you put Connie up for? Those directors would shit themselves if I walked in the door. Award nominated actress showing up for a sandwich and a train fare because they like the script 'cause they wanna mock their daughter. - The divorce is a formality now, is it? - I'm talking about your fucking princess. Well after thousands of applications, she finally got a job. Let me guess, it's the playing card in the school pantomime? Oh no, hang on, she got kicked out of school. So she must third spear holder from the left? - No, it's a good script. It's called As The Frost Glistens. They gave her the lead and she applied for herself. - Oh, she did tell me about that, she did it at Veronica's house. - And you couldn't tell me? - Why would I tell you? I want Connie to grow up and get out, I resent her. God. I mean, I gave up my career for her and she doesn't even have the smarts to finish her high school exams let alone become an actress. I mean yes, she's famous on YouTube but, fuck. - I hate conflict. - Oh, I love conflict. - I used to have responsibility. - Yeah and you don't have any responsibility anymore and you will never have any responsibility again unless you could see your way to being responsible for killing Connie and me, just a thought, I could goad you a little bit more if it helps. ♪ It's a witch hunt and no one knows where I am ♪ ♪ It's a witch hunt and we're still right out the sky ♪ ♪ It's a witch hunt we're there to infect your mind ♪ ♪ It's a witch hunt baby now get to the back of the line ♪ ♪ It's a witch hunt ♪ ♪ Got to hide behind this wall, witch hunt ♪ ♪ Got to hide behind this wall, witch hunt ♪ - Castille, fuck if he's done something like this.

(dramatic music) - You're 34 this year. - No, I'm 36. - Oh Jesus Christ, I'm in purgatory, do you know that? I've lived my life in this house with you and you're talentless. - Dad loved me, Mother. - He loves you in all the wrong ways, don't you get it? The abuse is endemic, why don't you understand that? - You don't understand what's wrong. - I'm not your mother. I'm not, that's why I can be so mean to you. I'm your rival for his affections and you're his favourite. - I know, I like that. - Not so dumb then. - I don't know, I don't think too much. I go out most days. - Oh yeah, your job. - I'm not so good at it anymore. - Why not? - [Connie] I'm not good with the money and I'm not good at watching people. - That's because you need new glasses and you didn't finish school. - I don't know. All I know is I'm happy most days. Dad says you're the mad lady we have to live with. You've got nowhere else to go and you don't like going outside so we keep you in the wall. - Do you think you could kill someone if I showed you how? - [Connie] You want me to kill you? - Mm, if it's not too inconvenient. - I've got underdeveloped motor skills according to Dr. Mann. We did corset work and the Mom picked up on it. I don't like you very much, you know that. - Weren't you in a film when you were younger? - [Connie] I was in a movie. Dad said I couldn't be in them anymore because I 'cause I'd stop being a princess. - Was this before or after you hit your head? - [Connie] I didn't hit my head, my head got vibrated. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (mumbling) Hi guys, it's Connie here, just checking in with you guys. How's everything been this week? Today I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about makeup and fashion and hair. So as you can see I'm really feeling the messy waves at the moment which is actually very simple to do. I just put it up in a bun in the night, slept on it and it came out like this. (speaker drowned out by opera music) So I'm gonna recommend that to you guys. Look how pretty this is. Look how pretty the lipstick is. - You've got no idea, have you? - [Connie] No. - He lobotomized you. - Is that cool? - Oh no, it is not cool at all. - [Connie] I can still do everything he tells me. - But is that good for you? - [Connie] Maybe. - How long do you reckon I've been in here? - [Connie] Mm, longer than me but you're my mother so. - I'm not your mother. - [Connie] Pretty sure you are. - Pretty sure isn't yes. - [Connie] Daddy would say you're having another of your episodes, Bonnie, time for the medication. - Oh, cute nose, one thing, do you know what sort it is? - [Connie] No, I have been talking on the phone to Dr. Mann, it's a psy-cot-ic or something. - Anti-psychotics. Oh Jesus, that explains everything. Does he have sex with you? - [Connie] I know other people have sex, but I don't, Mom. I don't know what to do. - But he drugs you? - [Connie] Does he? See, I'm not so stupid that I don't see that you understand what's going on here in a way that I don't. - You get drugged and fucked by your Dad on a regular basis. I'm on anti-psychotics so I don't know what the fuck's going on but I am starting to come clear enough now or waking up enough to be compos mentis. And know that I've got a chance of getting out of this place. Do you understand that? - You're my mother. You'll tell me anything if it means I go to sleep on time. I should go to work. - Oh yeah, does he drive you? - Uh-huh, I'm not good on the wheel. I can't push the pedals right. I smashed the truck and all these people were real worried 'cause Dad's face was all broken and the locals were like who the hell are you and I was like I'm Connie, I work in a theatre a few towns across and this is my Dad and my Mom at home, she's Bonnie but she's sick and I'm not the brightest button on the coat so that's why I don't think Dad will let me drive the truck anymore. - When was this? - Must've been 10 years ago now. It was gonna be in the paper but some bank robbery or something happened. Dad was really happy people didn't get to know about me breaking the truck. He had to go to hospital separate because he was actually quite hurt. He broke his leg, his ankle, some ribs, his nose, I think he hurt his head as well. I didn't know the truck could go so fast. - So your Dad's sick now? - I guess. I mean when I took the pills before, like a long time ago, I'd wake up and I'd feel funny. Not funny in a good way or funny in a bad way, just funny in a what's going on way. Since the accident I take the pills and nothing seems to be different and I don't know what's going on. I make stuff up to get through the day. No real routine anymore. I told Dad I would be his princess if he made sure I never grew up and I never had to deal with my wicked mother in the same way again. - So now I'm the wicked stepmother, is that it? - Daddy made sure I never grew up. I made a bargain with the devil. I feel so ashamed. I don't know why he left me. Something used to happen every night and he'd tell me about it the next day but I was asleep so he was really telling me about my dreams. Every month I'd have a special dream and I wouldn't wake up for days. (keyboard clicking) - Hi guys, so today I'm gonna be talking about food. What's your favourite food? Do you like sweets, are you healthy? Are you a salad kind of person? My favourite food is definitely sweets, I've got a real sweet tooth, anything, like cute little cupcakes, I actually bake a little bit. Yeah, it's amazing how you can stay skinny while eating sweets. I guess if that's all you eat, if that was like your main diet then maybe you're just gonna stay skinny 'cause you're not getting that much nutrition. But yeah, I should probably work on that if I'm gonna be an actor 'cause you have to have the perfect body. Anyway, what do you guys like to eat? Do you like anything green? I'm not a big fan of vegetables. I think that's part of the problem, I'm gonna have to work on that. Also exercise regimes, what keeps you guys fit? I quite like a little jog, go to the gym a lot. It's an opportunity to put on a little crop top and look super cute and look at all the cute guys at the gym so yeah, tell me about your lifestyle. Thanks guys, love ya. - Such a strange sensation. Snow on green grass, barefoot, not sure I ever felt this before. At least not that I can remember. See I just look around as the frost glistens. Reminds me of a funeral, cold December day. Blazing light, coffin carried from church to grave, but that frost, that frost never let up. Sun wanted to melt it away but there was no crystals. Well hell, they had other ideas. Like me, I've always had other ideas but now I have an envious temptation within me. Redemption. (rewinding) The girl, I guess she was maybe what, five feet tall. And she was not quite into the fella. Ma'am, I am so sorry. I did not realise that you were awake. I mean they have given you so many pills. I just did not notice. So what are you in, a coma? Are you now compos mentis? I do have a confession to make, Bonnie. I did kill your husband. (laughing) You see he was getting real close with Connie. I didn't like that. Not one bit. I set him straight. I put a pitchfork through his guts and I buried him in a field, in a shallow grave. He probably got eaten up by the animals. I don't know. And what did I do with Connie? What wouldn't I do with Connie? I trained her up. - To do what? - Do what a man might need. - And why am I here? - Well that's a good question. See here's how it works. There might be one, two, three of us still alive in here. Or there might just be one, two of us still alive in here. - The psychotics and sedatives have worn off? - The other consideration is one or two of us might also be dead. You know what, ma'am? I do believe you are coming back to life. - Are you telling me I'm dead? - Well I think you've been as good as dead. I think Connie here doesn't realise he's dead because my suspicion is my skeletal remains are right in the way in some out building because I blew my brains out with a shotgun. But why would I do something like that? Well let me tell you. That drunk accident, maybe it was a little worse than she told you. (engine revving) See a broken bone, I could cope with a broken bone. I'd cope with many broken bones. But maybe I couldn't cope with my balls being ripped off. Or is that me just being a little too melodramatic? - [Connie] Okay, seat belt on, look to the left, right round, look right round to the right and engine, oh, check it's in neutral first, oh, okay, engine on, handbrake up, look again and move off. - [Woman] The drugs ran out, Connie, you should've realised a long time ago. - I just do what the man pays me to do. I come here every day and do this. - [Woman] What does the man tell you to do? - I give you your drugs, I supervise you, I give you a daily workout. - [Woman] Then you're not my daughter. - No, why would I be? - [Woman] 'Cause you're coming to my house. - I care for you, Mrs. Castille. - [Woman] Mrs. Castille? That's a new one. - No, I'm not new, we just haven't talked much before now. - [Woman] Yes, I'm aware of that, Connie. - How'd you know my name? - [Woman] Something happened to us, dear. Something, we just need to figure out what it was and when and then we can find a way out of here. - You think we're trapped? - [Woman] That's an understatement. - Do you think David has something to do with this? - [Woman] Is David your Dad? - No. - [Woman] Wake up, Connie. David is definitely your Dad. - Then why would he do this? - [Woman] Jealousy. - What if he's not jealous? - [Woman] Why wouldn't he be? - Got all his questions, haven't I? - [Woman] In a way. - I don't know who's who. - [Woman] I just had this conversation with David. - Now you're having it with me. - [Woman] That's 'cause you did this to yourself. - I'm alone in here, aren't I? I don't talk to you and Dad anymore, do I? - [Woman] Connie, there might be someone here to see you. - Might, that's all I've heard all my life, maybe and might, Mother. I'm not fucking perfect like you, do you realise that? Vein and insipid and broken. - [Woman] No Connie, there's someone here to see you. They want to talk to you upstairs. You need to get up and go and find out who it is. I just spoke with your Daddy, he's gonna try and get you another job, just go. - Okay, I'll go see. (engine revving) (car crashing) (dramatic music) - Yeah, I was driving towards Hastings and a girl flagged down my car and practically jumped into the passenger seat from the beach near Win-chelsea. She's clearly distraught, she's clearly very ill and she's clearly in need of immediate medical attention so I'm taking her straight to the hospital. Can you be there to meet me? I think she must've come from a property or maybe a car accident from the Kent-East Sussex border somewhere, I don't know, that's just purely speculation but she's really very ill and. Donald Mark Hamlet, Don. She keeps passing out. Just keep the line open, wait. Now I'm gonna take you to a hospital, alright? What can I call you? I'm on the phone to the police. - Connie. My name's Connie, I'm 16. - Yeah, I don't want to be tactless Connie but I'm not sure you're 16. - No, no you're right. My name's Bonnie and I'm 46, Connie's my daughter, she's 16. - Yeah okay, stay calm and you'll be alright. - Connie, my name's Connie Castille, I'm 31, in 2007 or 2008 I did something, I recognise you, I don't know where I've been since then. Can you write this down before I forget? - Alright, that makes the most sense out of everything you've said so far. Are you getting this on the line? - What do you mean it makes the most sense? (speaker muffled) - Look, so far you've said that you are your 46 year old mother, then you said you're 50-odd year old Dad, you said you're your Dad's dead Filipino wife Na-gay-a and you also said you were your Dad's baby daughter, Princess. (ominous music) - [Charles] Hi Sam, it's Charles. What else have we got? - Nothing yet, oh, we got the man who found her. - [Charles] All right, well who is it? - Director of a film she was in 12 years ago. He found her because he was looking for her. - [Charles] That's media gold, right? - Don't be insensitive. - [Charles] I mean come on, that's award winning stuff. - Our source found us. This girl, she's isn't a compos. - [Charles] She doesn't need to be. - No, we're talking whatever happened to baby Jane. - [Charles] Psycho baby, what, is it some kind of film genre convention? - Maybe, look, this girl is really not that well and there might be two of 'em. - [Charles] What do you mean there are two of them? - Well speculation only, look, she might have been in there with her mother. Father might be an instigator for a decade or more. - [Charles] Hillbillies in Hastings. Alright, let's see where this goes. - You know Sky might use it as their main feed if they can't get their own people down quick enough. There's been a big accident on the motorway. The traffic Gods, they might be with you. - [Charles] Alright, I'm walking and I'm talking. Terry is next to me if I'm not answering so I'll give you a call. (siren wailing) - And now for some breaking news on a developing situation near Hastings, East Sussex. Initially reported on social media outlets by the student run Parallel News Service, a woman's claim that she has been held captive for the past 11 years has escalated into a major police operation. Details are currently limited. The first pictures we have are of reporter Terry Bennum courtesy of Parallel News Service, but we do know that this is an ongoing hostage situation at an undisclosed rural location. Speculation suggests this is an issue of geography and access but it is understood that the woman found was a former actress who in recent months was the subject of an Internet campaign to locate her exact whereabouts. We'll bring you more on this story as it develops throughout the day. - Darling, you also said that you'd thrown a pan of boiling water over your mother and that you locked your Dad in the bathroom after you'd offered him a blowjob. Yeah, I can do weird, but you've been through something. - I know you. - What do I do then? - I don't know. You knocked on my door. - No, no you stopped my car and you got in the passenger seat. I was looking for someone at the beach who matched your description. - You were looking for me. - I don't think I was looking for you but I found you alright. - You were. You were looking for me. I can't believe you were looking for me. I can't believe you found me. You were looking for me. I can't believe you were looking for me. I can't believe you found me. - I'm not sure I was looking looking for you but yeah, I found you alright. - Bebe Marie. It's the name I put down on a form. - Bebe Marie. - Bebe Marie. It's the name I put on the form. - Bebe Marie. How the hell would you know that name if it wasn't you? Yeah, this girl, I think I have actually been looking for her. - [Charles] So, strategy? - The meeting. Bring 'em on board. - [Charles] What if he wants a fee? What if he's got media assets? - I'll get onto legal. We're gonna need a bigger outlet piggybacking this if this gets big. Our resources, they can be a bit limited. - [Charles] Am I the priority reporter or is this on Theresa? - Big networks, they might use you today, but if it goes up a gear we'll slip the journos, will be all over it. - [Charles] I wanna say again, we need extra research. - No, not yet. This could be a smokescreen. - [Charles] See, even you think the real scandal is elsewhere. - Maybe, it's not your usual story to come out of this area of the country, is it? Keep tabs. - Just go online, it's been in the media. Look up find Bebe. Alright, it's not massive but it's there. If it is the right girl, then she was an actor in one of my movies a few years ago and she disappeared. Bebe, we thought you gave up. - I don't know where I am. I don't know what to say. I don't know what's real. - We're safe. But I think you're quite unwell. - Where are we going? - I'm gonna take you straight to a hospital, alright? Yeah, 20 minutes. - Am I okay? - Yeah we can get there faster than an ambulance. I don't know, she keeps passing out. No, I'm fine, I'm sober, I'm just in shock. Yeah okay. Look, I don't know, last time I saw her was 10, 11 years ago but now here she is. - Look it's the hottest day of the year. I've been running around from pilar to post trying to get all this information for you, alright? It might not be her, basement dungeon, the mother slash wife have been kept sedated on anti-psychotics but they ran out a few months ago. The bad man went away and the poor girl got compos mentis as she came out. That's practically torture on side effects alone. - [Charles] Now my name is Charles Barberry. I work for Parallel News Service. You'd have met two of my guys on the beach, Terry, she's our reporter, she's only a student at the moment, and Sam would've been the cameraman. Now what's going on here sounds pretty big so we've got our main journo coming down, her name is Theresa but she won't be with you for a couple of hours yet. So, Donald, I'm on the beach in question. Where are you, you can't miss it? - Yeah, I see you. - [Charles] Okay, well, thanks for talking with us then. - Do you know what's happening? - [Charles] No idea other than the girl is critical and it's an active hostage situation. Is that how much you know? - Pretty much. - [Charles] Well come on, you gotta start filling us in, please. - You read about the campaign? - [Charles] Find Bebe Marie. - Yeah, so about 12 years ago we made this film. We changed the name and it blew up, as much as a small indie film can blow up. Got bought by a studio so they could remake all of it, or at least parts of it when they saw fit. Anyway, I end up with a huge check. - [Charles] How much is a big check? - Well after all the tax, obviously it came from the US first, about 200 grand. Not so much to show for such a big amount but I decided to do the right thing, split it through the cast and crew. Bebe was due to get a check for about three grand, nothing major but enough for something out of the blue. - [Charles] And this is what you went to give to her last night, am I right? - Yes and no. - [Charles] What do you mean yes and no? - We never actually knew where she lived. We never kept any record and that girl is not Bebe Marie at all. - [Charles] Do you really want to tell me this next bit or not? - Why wouldn't I? - [Charles] My luck will be on this like flies round fucking shit, do you understand? - Better ask me first then, hm? - [Charles] Who is Bebe Marie? - Connie Louise Castille. But I only ever dealt with her as Bebe. It pisses me off when people don't call me by my professional name. Earnest Hartley is not director Donald Hamlet. (laughing) - [Charles] Terry's there with you, I assume. Is this the girl we're thinking of? - Daughter of Bonnie Castille. - You know who these people are? - [Charles] Yeah, they once had an arterial connection to a big media family. Family feud, connections were cut, something like that. - So what did Bebe's Dad, I'm sorry, Connie's Dad do? - Castille? Fuck if he's done something like this. - [Charles] He had a Filipino wife, died during childbirth, child died shortly afterwards, then he came back to the UK. He was investigated for fraud and doing everything he shouldn't have done abroad. - So who you gonna call? - [Charles] Well I'm thinking aloud. Terry, thoughts? - This could be massive. - This story needs integrity. That girl was a mess. I can't exploit her. - We're exploiting the story, that's what we do in the media. - Yeah, I understand, which is why you need me as an asset. (waves crashing) - Police in southern England are slowly releasing the details of what they call a major captivity incident in Hastings. A young woman was found in a rural lane after having escaped capture. - [Charles] Police have cancelled a press conference but they have issued a statement. - Tell me. - [Charles] Absolute media blackout until further notice. - That's not normal, anything else? - [Charles] Surprisingly yeah. She's currently in a critical condition. All media cooperation is essential. No leaks on social, please. They're hammering this, they want everything dark. (slamming) - [Connie] A young princess has disappeared. Held captive by people masquerading as her father and mother. She endures terrible hardship. Plotting escape, she uses all of her wit and cunning to kill the mean man and make the woman suffer. Using the Internet as her only means of communication with the outside world, she makes the world start the hunt to find the princess. - What the fuck are we dealing with here? - This is meticulous planning of years. - You really think that's the case? You're suggesting everything that girl has done may be written in that manuscript? - Yeah, that's pretty much what I'm saying. - You can all go fuck yourselves and get out of my head because all I know is she might have been through something and I'm gonna stick by her and sell her because that is what's gonna sell this story. - [Man] All the Hollywood stuff, that actually plays out. She was in quite a few films between 1984 and 1989. You see she had some talent. She was whisked off to LA as an artist of extraordinary ability, that's how she got a visa. She got representation and then she turned into a bit of a bad girl, got a bad reputation and then she found her way back to England. - What is actually wrong with Connie? And cut out the bullshit. - Okay, she had a few cuts and bruises. Nothing anyone couldn't not conceivably have on them in their normal day to day life. In fact, the doctors really had to look for them. She was grabby on the outside but I will be unrepeatably crude. I didn't do the examination. Obviously your girlfriend Vivian did and her team but being the push media man that I am I was practically ever present. But just so you've got this information from the ether as such, I quote one of Vivian's colleagues, girls who've been held captive for 10 years usually aren't virgins. - [Charles] Listen up, you're not gonna believe this. So, our man in question who might be behind all this, David Ronald Castille. - The pissing fuck, what? - [Charles] The girl is Connie Castille. The thing with Donald, he doesn't want money but we may have to treat him as an asset. - Fuck me, I'll get ground of my Mom. Budget directly authorised. Let's keep this thing moving. Castille? Fuck if he's done something like this. - [Charles] I need more researchers on it. - We'll build it, the blackout's being respected so we've got time. - [Charles] Look, we're playing this straight but just remember we've got two angles on this. We've got the girl's version of events and we've got the best friend, Vivian. Something's not right here, keep tabs. ♪ How did I get here, how do I let go ♪ ♪ How did I get here, how do I let go ♪ ♪ How did I get here, how do I let go ♪ (hip hop music) (camera snapping) - Are you sure you're ready to deliver this interview? - I've been waiting to give this interview for 10 years. - And it was a car crash that you were in with your father that really paved the way to freedom? - Yeah, I mean what I didn't understand was while I was mentally captive 100%, physically I could've actually got out if I wanted to. I just didn't grasp that because the abuse was so endemic. As I said, I actually had a job to begin with and I was always told I wasn't allowed to speak so I didn't. And for one job he was teaching me how to drive but I wasn't very good at it and we hit a fence. I was wearing my seatbelt but he wasn't and he was badly hurt. These people turned up, pulled him out of the car, we went to hospital but because I was always told I wasn't allowed to speak, they thought I was simple and everything was just arranged for me and I found myself back in the house and that was it. - And do you remember just how badly he was injured? - I just remember the smell of bleach. - [Interviewer] Why bleach? - In the truck that day in the passenger foot well and on his lap were all these cleaning supplies we just bought. Normally stuff like that would go in the boot but I said I wanted to drive. (speaker drowned out by ominous music) (car crashing) - And your mother was still in the house? - At that point, yeah. - [Interviewer] So-- - Sorry, I just need a minute. I can't believe you are both still here for me, you've been such a massive help. I love you so much, Don, I really do. - We're just helping you through. - No, I think it's much more than that. - It isn't. I think you should talk to that production guy. - Why? - I don't think he's getting enough credit. If it wasn't for him, I never would've been able to find you. - I'll take him out for dinner. Stop hassling me, we've got shit to do. - [Woman] Where's your Dad now? - I was gonna ask you that. See, I don't think I've left the house in about a year. Not as pretty as I used to be. - [Woman] What about your job? - I wasn't good at it anyway, they had to let me go. - [Woman] Why? - This man wanted me to do stuff in the toilets and then he gave me a load of money. My manager found out and he said it was the last straw. - Jesus. And no one's realised you've been sick all this time? - This all just happened one night. I think it was after I crashed the truck, I don't know. - What was your job, Connie? - [Connie] I was like a waitress. - [Woman] What year are we in? - I don't know what year I'm in. - [Woman] How can you not know? - Dad always said you were just sleeping but we needed to make sure your body was still working so I gave you a daily workout. - [Woman] Connie, when did I actually wake up? - Properly? A few months ago. - [Woman] A few months? - It's like you woke up and you were normal again. - [Woman] So how long do you think I've been asleep for? - Before the truck smash. Barack Obama was the President of the USA. - [Woman] Can we watch TV? - It's your house. - [Woman] No, it's not my house. I'm just a guest. So where is David? - He hasn't come home and that's why we're here, that's why nothing's getting done around here. - Are you sure? Are you ever going to tell the truth? - What truth is there to tell? I'm Connie Castille. I'm the princess in the castle. And for the rest of my life I'll sell papers. For the rest of my life I'll sell TV shows, books, films, documentaries. People love me because I'm a survivor. - Are you? - What did I tell you when we were kids? - Many delusional things, Connie. - No, I said I was happy for my life to be the perfect illusion. 12 years old, year seven, I told you I'd make you famous one day. Well, you're not as famous as me, obviously, but you're getting there miss celebrity doctor. You counsel the rich and famous now, don't you? Who got you that job? I better finish the interview. She's just getting scraps. Once this airs the phone won't stop ringing. - Just don't tell them you shot your Dad in the face in the garage and left him to bleed to death. - I didn't and that was self inflicted. - You mean he pulled the trigger because you told him to. - Princesses don't pull triggers. - Princesses poison their wicked mothers and push them down the stairs though. - She fell. I did what I was told under extreme duress. - Let's see how long you can keep this up for. - 12 years and counting.
