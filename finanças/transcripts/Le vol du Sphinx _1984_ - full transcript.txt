The Devil's Trill Sonata. Sublime. Shh. Is that your son? Is he rehearsing for a competition? A concert, next week. Mr. Staubli, you know who I am and why I need your stuff. This must remain secret. No-one knows where I will be, and I trust no-one. Not even my right-hand man. It's there, Mr. El Farik. Okay, this seems fine. I don't know much about it. So, Loussif, handle the rest. You'll meet me on the 15th. The money will be there. The 15th. Otherwise, on the 16th, I'll be working with the Americans. Idiot! Stop, Tom! Come on. Let's go! Look what he did. Go. Next time, he'll set the hangar on fire, you'll see. Did you see how he hit you? He wasn't hitting me. Leave that. We have other things to deal with. There's no point. But Tom, we have to… By the way… Sorry about last night. I was a little… worn out. I hope I didn't wake you. What… Tournier? Where were you, Mr Staubli? I looked all over. I've been here! What's the luggage doing here? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. There was a mix-up. Okay. Well, have this taken away right away, Tournier. There's no reason to get upset. I'm not upset. I'm quite calm. I'm just asking Mr. Loussif the question. How are we going to get to Sierra Leone? By camel? Okay, so I spoke with the pilot… 400 miles in the desert… They're not in any hurry. Who are these tourists? I don't know. Businessmen who have a layover here. Something happened. The plane left without them. I rented them the Mercedes till tomorrow. Are they going to Salam? They have no choice. The plane they came on is coming to get them tomorrow. Seen Aboud at the hangar? No. Are you done? I have to go. I've got stuff to do. Where the hell is Aboud? Very good. Is this car coming, then? Right away, sir. There it is. Off we go. Car's here. I thought you were in a hurry. What's up? Eh? Oh, nothing. Did you see the girl who got off the plane? She reminds me of… Don't you think? What was her name again? Who? The woman, in France. Don't pretend to be working. You're not that busy. Where were you last night, you bastard? Traveling. Are there new customers? Yes. I need to call Mendel. They asked for a Land Rover. Or will you tell him? Was there a woman with them? If you so much as look at her, I'll bite you. What nice weather. It's nice, it's… Looks like our little holdup has a silver lining. We'll get to know each other better. Thanks. I'm Ariana. Excuse me. Not at all. I'm Serge. It's all arranged. The hotel is letting us use an office. We can start working this afternoon. No word from El Farik? You know I can't contact him. We never know where he is. But there's nothing to worry about. Oh, no, I know. It's not that. I should have left my wife behind. Why would you say that? It was a good idea. She's very nice. She wants to enjoy the trip. She decided to go see the Todgha Gorges this afternoon. I rented her a car, but… It's only two hours away, but I don't like letting her go alone. Tom, you never come around anymore. Lost your thirst? A Martini. Got a cigarette? Right away, ma'am. Laura? Laura. Mr. Staubli offered to go with you this afternoon. Isn't that nice of him? What do you think? Yes. Laura. I don't know how you manage with this car. I barely know how to drive. I started young. You okay? Is something wrong? I'm fine. I just feel a little nauseous. Let's hope it doesn't last too long. Yes! Straight ahead! Straight ahead! Stop! Hurry up. Let's go. Where is it again? What? That I drop the bags off. In Galat. And the crates in Tinjad. You hear that? Bags in Galat, crates in Tinjad. Okay, okay. Shouldn't we be there by now? We've been driving for two hours, and it's just as barren as ever. Are you sure you aren't lost? No, I don't think so. I took the turn they said to take. The gorges must be there, at the foot of the mountains. Well, I think we're good and lost. Do you have a map? Pull over. Pull over! Stop the car! You shouldn't get out. It's hot. I need some air. Take this. My God. There's really no-one. That's enough. Let's go back! We don't have enough gas. What? I didn't want to tell you, but… We're out of gas? This is absurd. This loon drives off with no map, no gas… And of course I get stuck in the mix. It's okay, it's okay. Where's he going? Aren't you going to stop? Stop! If I find him… Come on. Get in the shade. He'll be hearing from me… This road must lead somewhere. It'll lead us to a town. Get in. We're here. You can rest. Rest! Are you insane? I don't want to rest. I want to go back. Tell Tournier to come get me. Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am. Telephone? In the village? Yes, yes. You don't speak French? And I don't speak Arabic. Is there a phone? I'd be surprised. Thank you. Sphinx! Sphinx! Did you just get in? Ten minutes ago. I think Mr. Staubli is ill. Didn't you see us before? Why didn't you stop? Stop? This isn't a taxi. You need to take us back to the hotel. I'll pay what it costs. No. Listen, I'll pay you whatever you want, but take us back! I have to unload this. It's late. I'm tired, and you're sick. Off to Zagora tomorrow. You can hitch a ride if you want. Thank you. In the meantime, I need to find someplace for him to sleep. When I stay here, I sleep in the fort up there. I can have a straw mattress made up for him. And for you. That's very kind of you. Thank you. He's not feeling better? Is he often sick? No. He must be reacting to the vaccines. Here, give him this. It'll help. The mosquitoes, eh? They're voracious. Why did you turn around before? I put it against the wind so it wouldn't get tipped over. It's the only thing you care about. Right? This afternoon, you didn't hesitate to leave us alone in the desert. We could have died. Well, you didn't. And I knew you weren't far from town. What are you doing here? I mean, a man like you, out here? There must be a reason. Why here? What's wrong with it? You don't like all this? The desert, the palms, the biblical night? Don't you like it? Do you ever answer someone's questions? You like mystery? The Sphinx isn't the plane. It's you. I had some problems… Where, in France? Yeah. It was…. What? Did you kill someone? No. Someone killed me. Someone like you. So. Five o'clock tomorrow morning. I wanted to say-- Shh. Does it always have that effect on you? It's strange. I'd forgotten that feeling. Like playing hooky. Yeah. I don't want to leave. Let's go back in three or four days. We're good here. We're lost… But he's going to die up there. That doesn't bug you? Anyway, I can't. I must get the Sphinx back to Zagora to reload. Reload what? Stuff that people around here need. They need me, here. But I need you, too. No. Come on. Sleep. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Oh! Shall we? Let's go. Well then, let's go! Next time, you'll have to find something smarter. What's going on? Ben? Well, don't mind me! What's she doing here? You'll really sleep with anyone. And you insult me, too? I won't stand for it! Get her out of here. Well then… That takes the cake! Explain yourself. What are you doing here? Where's Staubli? In his room, I imagine. He's ill. Leave me. I'm tired. Hang on… I don't understand. You were supposed to keep him there for two days. Yes, but it didn't work. Let me sleep. What? What? You came here because there was 60,000 bucks in it for you… And that meant keeping Staubli busy by any means necessary! You're not going to get off that easy. Talk! What matters to you here? We've been fighting for ages. You'd not have come without the money! And I earned that money. Running out of gas, Staubli, the fever, the little lost town, no way to get back. What a drag. Then the pilot shows up with his plane… A plane? What plane? You couldn't manage with the pilot? No. I even slept with him. But he's not an easy mark. What the hell happened? We've been waiting for an hour! I dropped some clients at the hotel. Where's Aboud? Which ones? The Land Rover? Did the engine die? Ran out of gas. No, no… I filled the tank myself. Don't worry. It's not your fault. That's not the only thing I'm surprised about. We're terribly sorry, Mr. Staubli… Yes, well, I'm feeling better. Is the plane here? About that… We have some bad news. The Fokker won't be able to return till tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? He doesn't know what he's saying! My meeting is tonight, not tomorrow! And I'll be there, mark my words! This is absurd! It's inadmissible, Loussif! Quiet, Tournier! I'm not done. What are you thinking? Leaving me hanging with six million dollars' worth of weapons? All my deliveries are ready. I have warehouses all over. So you think I'm going to sell them at a flea market? I refuse to be sick. Oh… Calm down. Tournier, tell him to figure it out. It's his job! What do you want to do? It'd take two days by car. No train, and there's only one plane a week. Except two on Christmas. No planes? What about the biplane that took me back from Tinjad? Too old. Can't fly that far. Then add a reserve tank! Or ten! Get it done! I need to be able to fly around the world in that plane if I want to. Hop to it! But-- No! Leave me alone. You played the part well. "Absurd." "Inadmissible." But we're done acting. The folks from Cleveland are paying us a million dollars. What's your plan? Pay back what you already got? I'm not an idiot, Loussif, nor a coward. I have a plan. Don't keep racking up the mistakes. The only way to get Staubli to the meeting is the pilot and his biplane. Take care of them, or I will. And you know what that means. What are you doing here? I'm here for a lesson. Oh, it's you. I don't give lessons. Get out. No. I'm here to teach you a lesson. Think of it as a private, at-home lesson. Stop it, you psycho! Ow! You're the psycho. So make yourself scarce. Don't do anything. Don't see anyone for a while, and you'll feel much better. No, none of that! Stop! You've really got shit for brains. What's this all about? Don't play dumb. Just tell me what I'm supposed to do or not do. Because I didn't quite understand the lesson. What's this about, the two half-wits smashing my dishes? -Tom, I don't know-- -Enough! Cut the crap! You've been lying from the very start! I want to know what's going on. Don't get me wrong. I'm not about to get beat up and not find out why. What was the sick guy doing in Tinjad? Why'd you bust up the Sphinx? Why'd you sleep with me? And where's your husband in all of this? You told him? He's fine with it? Did he send me those two clowns? -But Tom, I-- -Shit! I don't want to know. I don't give a damn! We've said all we have to say. The less I see of you, the better I'll feel! How stupid can I be? There you are. They said you were showering. Is there a problem, Sheikh Selim? You're the one who was a problem. It's a rather delicate situation. We've dealt with those before. No, I'm sorry, believe me, but not this time. You wouldn't want the aerial authorities to look too closely at your pilot's license, would you? -No. -Well then. You had passengers this morning? You flew them back from Tinjad? Well, a complaint was filed. By whom? I can't cover you much longer. I don't intend to risk… I get it. No risks! Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Café Bleu. Okay. I'll have another. Okay? I was with Sheikh Selim. You won't believe this. He came to see me to-- You know what we should do? Take some time off. A few days, a week… Take a trip. Get drunk. Am I wrong? Did you hear what I just said? He wants to forbid me from flying. Someone filed a complaint against me. All the more reason. There's no work right now anyway. You had an accident? It's nothing. I burned myself. Isn't this strange? Yesterday, the girl from palm grove. Today, Sheikh Selim… He'll have forgotten all this in two days. And the girl is none of our business. First of all, she's a whore. Poor thing. You haven't seen a woman in ages. Right, be a smart ass. Women… In Tangiers, in Paris. They're all the same! Bet me 500 dirhams. Okay, 1000 dirhams, she's a whore. I know the type. Not one real emotion. It's all fake. Asshole. Asshole? 2,000 dirhams! So… They paid you a visit, too? And it worked! They intimidated you! Careful with that. You know how much a shirt like this costs? Yes. Okay, okay. I'll figure it out. What was that about? Nothing important. I'll let you rest. What are you talking about? There's no time to rest. Did you find the pilot? I was just on my way. I'm the pilot of the Sphinx. Recognize me? Of course. Why is everyone treating me like I'm senile? Where were you? We've been looking everywhere for you. You can't have looked very hard. I'm here now. When are we leaving? Right away. We have no time to lose. Will you hurry up and give me the shot? Be at the hangar at three. The plane will be ready. You're crazy coming here… Men aren't allowed. I had to see you right away. What's going on? We need to talk about the thing with the pilot. Is now really the time? I don't have time to explain. He's the only one who can get Staubli to El Farik. Loussif tried to scare him, but he doesn't seem to be backing down. Right, go ahead and laugh. He's going to ruin everything. So we have to stop him. Right. And where do I come in? It isn't my fault we're in this mess! If you had done your job… Stop it! Not with me. What do you want? I came to give you a second chance. Don't pass it up if you want to stay in the game. Your pilot has decided to take us to Sierra Leone. Loussif is prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him. He doesn't give a damn about the guy. So… I don't want things to go that far. And neither do you, right? You know him a little. Go see him. Explain. Make him understand. You have to stop him from taking us. It'll be best for everyone. The plane's set to leave in an hour. I'm counting on you. Wait! I'm going to need you. There's money in it. Mister! There's a white woman. She wants to see you. Where? That way, in a house. A pretty lady with pretty eyes. I'll take you if you give me money. Okay? Hurry. She's waiting. I need to speak to the pilot. It's urgent. The hotel taxi isn't here, but if you take Erfoud's car, he'll drop you at the airport in 20 minutes. Thank you. Here, mister. More money, and I'll tell you more. Go on, beat it. You're making a mistake, mister! Come on! Shit! You know, don't count on Tom to be on time. Anyway, time out here… We need another pilot. Tom's the only one who can fly the Sphinx. Anyway, I won't let you. We have no choice. There was an accident in the village. What? Is it serious? Yes. Come on! Come on! NO SMOKING There's no point hanging around here. Let's go back to the hotel. Beautiful. You just heard a rebroadcast of the concert at the Dakar opera of the young virtuoso Rachid El Farik. Tom! Stop! What are you talking about? No way! What's going on? You scared the living hell out of us! You're not surprised. You don't see anything? No, you're just dirty. Did something happen? No. Nothing. They're waiting for you at the plane. Staubli and the other guy. And the girl? I saw her in town. Was she leaving? Yeah. Isn't it for the better? Yes. Well, all works out in the end. All works out in the end. Thanks to music. Saïd El Farik is coming tonight. You know how I reached him? In his son's box at the opera. So all is well! Why are you making that face? Is this all the music you have? Well, it's just like you. You don't mind going through my things? I thought you'd left. I never intended to leave. Who did this to you? Your pals. Your colleagues. I don't have any friends here. I must have got the wrong idea, then. I thought that because every time I talk to you, those two half-wits come after me and beat me up. So, I deduced… That's why I'm here, Tom. You're mixed up in a bad business. You can't fly them. You hear me? It could be dangerous. Tom. I want to stay with you. All that matters now is that we be together. Nothing else matters. Right. Not at all. Don't be like that. I didn't come here to hurt you. I came to stay. I really like you. Really. God damn it! Out of water again! Can you go get me some mineral water from the fridge? That burns. You're prickly. What I can't understand is why you're involved in all this. Don't you know you don't shower with clothes on? That's deep! How'd they do that? Leave it. Unless you want to check out your husband's handiwork. It probably wasn't Serge. Loussif gives the orders. And what does your husband do? And why are you mixed up in all this? You didn't let me explain this morning. Okay. Go ahead. Serge, my husband, is Staubli's business attorney. Staubli is an arms dealer. He has a 2.5-billion-franc contract with a guy in the Middle East. But the Americans want the deal. They offered Serge and Loussif a big cut if they got the deal handed to them. They have to stop Staubli from signing with El Farik. There you are. And what's your role? Me? I was just supposed to keep Staubli at the palm grove for two days. Then you showed up. You ruined everything with your plane. I see. Hence the romantic, moonlit scene. The naïve charm. "I'd forgotten that feeling." "Like wanting to play hooky." "Let's stay two more days." "I need you." How much did that bullshit earn you? It's hard to know where your loyalty is, with that much money. It's the way I was raised. I can't help it. But it wasn't just for the money. What? It's not true? Tell me I'm wrong. Say that you were really interested in me! I'm not that stupid. I'm right. Of course I'm right. I get it. Don't worry. I've been trained. You didn't hit me first. Stop, Tom. It's over. No, it's not over, because you keep coming back and trying again! You think, "It failed first time, but all's not lost." "We can still hit harder! Come on!" Don't touch me! The moment I saw you, I knew I should be wary. Mendel warned me, too. "No emotions, nothing's real." "It's all fake. They're all whores!" Don't go anywhere! I'm not done with you! Well I am! Were you with him? Could you take me back to the hotel? Laura! Laura! Laura! Stop! Stop! I looked everywhere for you. Come. Thank you, Mendel. Thanks for the ride. Where were you? Speak up. Speak up! Answer me! What did you do? What did you do?! Exactly what you wanted me to do! I made love with Tom, but it was good, and I liked it! You thought I'd stay with you? Never! Never! -Why?! -Never! Why?! What do you want now? I wanted to see if everything was ready for El Farik. Are you okay? Should I call the doctor? Stop worrying about me. Before I got here, I was never sick in my life. Go on… Leave me alone. ROYAL POLICE What a time. Where is she? Who? Don't play stupid. Your wife. Did she leave? Ah… Our wife. Yes! She left. Flew away. Along with Staubli's money. Shocking, I know. Laura, a common thief. She ran off with a belt containing over 100,000 francs. That's impossible. Yes, indeed! You don't know her very well yet. She always did love money. That's why she came here, anyway. For 60,000 dollars. As a… An enticement. Ma'am! I'm sorry, I need your passport. I have to ask you to make yourself available till the investigation is over. Your 2,000 dirhams. I don't want them. I was wrong. No. You were right. Look, Tom… You're wrong about her. Earlier, when I drove her back, she was crying. Her husband came up. He was crazy, like he'd lost her and only found her by chance. A minute later, he was hitting her like he wanted to kill her. He was hitting her? Yes. A lot. It can't be easy for her on her own. Tell me, Tournier, will your wife be joining us for our last evening? I don't think so, no. After what she's been through, with the arrest… Of course, I'll return the 100,000 francs. Oh, no…. I don't understand. I'm terribly sorry. Sheikh Selim questioned her at length. He hasn't found the belt. He thinks she wasn't alone. For now, she's in her room. In the state she's in, she won't be coming down. She's in her room? Yes. I suppose you're pleased with yourself? Perhaps you can explain all this about a theft. How much was it I stole again? Was it you, Mr. Loussif, who saw me come out of Staubli's room? I don't understand why you wanted to stop me from leaving. Really, you could have just asked. Laura! Don't move. When I need a doormat for my feet, I'll call you. Oh. You're really something! Isn't she something? I like you. You've got guts. Sit down with us. Let's forget our disagreements. El Farik is arriving tonight, and that's all that matters to me. Come on. To El Farik's arrival, and to Laura's beauty. Hey! It's me! I've arrived. It was nice of you to wait. I wasn't sure I'd make it. Excuse us, sir. This is a private meeting. I know, I know. I thought you might be interested in this little thing. Is it yours? I found it in Tournier's room. Forgive me. I had to rummage around a bit. What is the meaning of this, Tournier? This is too easy! Obviously, he stole the belt, then claims it was in my room! Why would he give it back? That's the point! That's the trap, right? You won't get anything out of him. He only speaks through proxies. It's annoying. I never understand what he's saying. No, we don't have time. We don't have time! Look at this. I can't meet El Farik like this! I need to go change! You've got some explaining to do, Tournier! Excuse me. You'd better think hard about what you're going to say. Thank you. For what? My foul temper? For your stubbornness. Must be my old age. It's crazy how attached I can get. I couldn't bear the thought of you leaving. What is it? Oh, it's you. You're here? I was looking for you. How are you? I hope I'm not intruding. I just need a word with my wife. I spoke to Staubli. It's all worked out. I explained everything. Just a misunderstanding. So… He'd like to apologize. Laura, go see him. This is the last thing I'll ask of you. Laura, Laura… Forgive me for everything. I had no choice. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Why did you do that? I don't know what happened. When I came in, he was lying down. I knew he was sick, so I went over. And then there were gunshots. I thought someone was shooting me. Then, this was on the floor. Let go! I didn't shoot him! Shit… Shit, he's dead! Don't be stupid, Tom. It's over now. Give me the gun. Don't move. And shut up! Be reasonable. Give me the gun. Don't you think one mistake is enough? Get out! Get out! If you don't leave… Now shut the door. Anyone comes in, and she's dead! Don't get upset. Come on, let's go! Come on, Tom! Don't be stupid! Come out! Jump. I can't, I'll break my leg. Jump or I'm leaving! Bastard. Where's Staubli? I'm leaving in two hours. I'm hungry. Bring me some food. Sorry, Mr. El Farik. There's been a slight hiccup. Are you getting in or what? It's gonna be okay. Fine, but where? For how long? Forever, and then we'll see. We'll find a little place in the desert, raise goats, eat dates and cheese… Happiness! I'm beat. My head hurts. Let me. In the back, there's a flask in a crate. Shit! Come on! Grab the handle there. Do what I say! Hold her steady. Don't touch anything else. You're leaving? I'm flying! It'll never work. Let go. Get out, quick! Tom! Tom… Now we're dead. Yes, we're dead. Where's he running off to? Hey! Are you sure it's this way? And not that way, or that way? Won't you answer me? Hello! Are we lost? Eh? What are you doing? That's my dress! Sometimes, it's wiser to have your dress over your head than over your butt. He never ceases to amaze me… We'll do an aerial search of the south. One way or another, at this point, if he's past it, you won't catch him. If he isn't… It's fate. Are you all right? Instead of talking, you should focus on figuring out where we're going, because this game could go on for quite a while. Come look. Come look. Did you know? See that road there? It leads to a village below the dunes. We have to move quickly now. We're here. This line is the only road to Kebili across the plain. And Zagora is over here. He has to come this way. He can't do this? No, it's too risky. You have to be crazy. If you get lost in there… We're going to split up. Go to the village and call him. You have to be convincing. After that, wait for me over there. What about you? Won't you get lonely all on your own? Go on. Laura? Don't worry. I'm a big girl, now. Thanks for coming, Loussif. I hope I never see you again. I'm not leaving with you? You can't leave me here! Oh, yes. You'd better hope there's no fallout. What's all this money? It's for you to do some cleaning. I don't want any witnesses. Understand? Do I understand, Mr. Loussif? No problem. CAFÉ - GROCERY I'd like to call the Salam Hotel. And a big glass of water. Thank you. Hello? This is the Salam. Yes, Mrs. Tournier. I'll put you through to his room. Mr. Tournier? You wife is on the line. The keys, please! Okay, I'll calm down. But you have no idea… To open your eyes, and… Seeing the plane on fire… Tom, stuck in his seat… On fire… Oh, please, come get me. I can't go on. I don't know what to do… No. No, there's no-one here. Come quick. Don't worry. I'll be there in two hours. Stay where you are. Don't go anywhere. Stay calm. Yes. See you soon. Mr. Tournier, you're wanted at reception! No time! We've got some talking to do, little lady. Mendelssohn Transport Rentals. What? Okay. Okay, Laura. Thank you. Aboud! Aboud, that was Laura! He's alive! Can we talk? I can explain! Oh, that changes everything. Come out, swine, or I'll blow you sky high! What do you want? To kill me? You're going to fix your tire. We'll go get Laura. Then we'll all go talk to the cops. Hurry up! Get in! How'd you get this? Hurry! He's not alone. Go that way! Don't let them get away! Nobody's getting away. It'll be all right. Get down! Careful! Shit, Laura! I'm falling! Careful… Is it bad? I don't know. You broke your watch? No. Besides, I haven't wound it in ages. Don't leave me. We can't leave each other ever again. Leave you? I don't ever want to leave you. We'll be together forever. I'll get you out of here. Stop, I'm going to die laughing… You see where we are? Are you going to carry me on your back? If I have to, yeah. Thomas? Laura. Let me tell you something. Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
