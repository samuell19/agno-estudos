(dramatic violin tones) - [Newscaster] At last report, armies from over 60 nations had deployed troops in the region and those numbers are continuing to swell at an incredible pace. It's perhaps ironic that the majority of the activity is centering around a valley in Israel whose name strikes fear in the hearts of many, the Valley of Armageddon. - I can't believe that Bronson is on his way over there. - President Franco Macalusso-- - Are you all right, grandma? - Everything seems to be falling into place, Helen. Who is fighting and where they're fighting and what they're fighting about, even President Macalusso-- - Things will get better grandma, they always do. - Yes, I know they will Helen. But they're going to get a lot worse before they get better and I'm just afraid that you're not ready for what lies ahead. (doorbell rings) - Sorry. - Hi honey. - [Helen] Hi. I was hoping you'd have time to stop and say goodbye. Are you all packed? - Yeah, I think so. It's pretty hard though when you only get 10 minutes notice. - Are you sure you want to do this, Bronson? I mean the latest reports are looking really ugly. Chuck's in Tel Aviv and he says he's never seen-- - We've been through this already, Helen. Come on, it's not as if this is my first trip to the front lines. - Things are different this time and you know it. - Look, you and I have been news anchors for so long, you know it's a newsman's job to go out and get the news. Besides, it's my responsibility to the world and who knows, maybe in some small way I can make a difference. - If anyone can, it's you. It's just that I've never seen it this bad. I mean my grandmother is completely convinced that the world is about to end. - She was talking about that during the Gulf War. Let's just hope she's wrong again. - What if she's not wrong? I mean what if the world is about to end? Have you ever thought about that? - Yeah, I've thought about that, it's hard not to. You and I may be the ones that has to tell the world that it's all over. We'll just do what we've always done. We'll just have to tell the truth. It's never failed us before. But right now Helen, the truth is that I love you very much and I will be back before you know it, trust me. - Okay. Will you call me from the plane? - Mm hmm. - I'm doing the six o'clock report tonight and I shouldn't be much later. I don't want to let you go. - I'll be just fine, Helen. - Promise? - Promise.

A fear that what seemed nothing more than a regional conflict only a few weeks ago may now be developing into the start of nothing less than a full-scale World War. Continuing troop buildups in the Middle East today followed a pattern of escalation that leaves most observers fearing the very worst. But while the crisis has really only been developing for just over a month now, it's clear its roots go much deeper and today the question on all of our minds is whether this 4,000 year old conflict is about the find its end in a nuclear fireball. WNN's continuing covering of the Battle of Armageddon will continue. When we come back, we'll join Bronson Pearl who is on location in the very eye of the storm in central Israel. - [Alizar] Yes Mr. Pearl, it is Armageddon. To us the word is Megiddo. - Megiddo, Armageddon, the name doesn't really matter. It's what it represents. Half the world's armies are on their way here right now and everyone that is watching television is expecting well, the end of everything. - We understand that, Bronson. But you have to understand too, this is our land. It's all we've got, there is no other safe place for the Jew. You know that. Wherever we have gone for 2,000 years, we have been hated and butchered and now they want to do it to us again in our own land. It's just a tiny sliver of a land. The land is meaningless. It is our existence they cannot tolerate. We have got to fight. We are not a people who can hope for a better day. We live as one, we'll die as one. - I do sympathize with you, General. But it's not just nations we are talking about here. - [Producer] We're set Bronson. We're going live in 30 seconds. - Are you gonna give me the cue from Helen? (helicopters whirring) Thanks Helen, I'm standing here in the heart of modern day Israel not far from a place called Armageddon. All we can do is hope and pray that this name does not end up being prophetic as events unfold here over the next few hours. Less than five miles from here, troops from over 60 nations are gathering and preparing for war. The fact that this massive conflict appears to be building up around a place called Armageddon is not really a coincidence. The fact is that Armageddon is the only passage into Israel that mother nature has left open and that leaves enormous foreign armies only hours from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. But even though the ground based troops have not yet made it into these cities, hundreds of aircraft have and as you can see, the damage is extensive. (bomb sirens blaring) So far there are no reports of non-conventional weapons being used but clearly we are now only seeing the start of something much bigger. Hour by hour, every nation in the world is being forced to take a side in this showdown and as Pentagon spokesman Richard Stanfield has made clear, the United States is no exception. - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The President has made it clear that the United States supports the right of Israel to exist. To that end, we will use whatever force is appropriate and necessary to defend that right. The President has been in touch with the Russians, the Chinese and the President of the Arab League within the past hour. He has forcefully communicated America's position and our decision to meet any aggression in kind. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The United States is ready and prepared to go to war to defend Israel, our friend and our ally. Thank you very much. No more questions, no more questions. - Obviously the stakes are much higher than this tiny valley in this tiny nation and while the hands on the Doomsday Clock move closer to midnight, there still may be a glimmer of hope for the world. European Union President Franco Macalusso is expected to arrive in the area tomorrow morning. He is the one man who has the respect of every single party to the conflict and many believe that he is the only one who can back us away from the edge of the cliff before we tumble over. - Just hold on here-- - In fact, in an intriguing proclamation yesterday, the charismatic leader boldly stated that he won't allow the world to destroy itself. He even seemed to predict that a miraculous event awaits us. A moment when we find that missiles and bombs are no match for the will of a completely united mankind. Hopefully President Macalusso can convince the world that the Battle of Armageddon is not a foregone conclusion and that history will instead unfold exactly as we write it over the next few days. I'm Bronson Pearl, reporting for WNN near Armageddon in central Israel, Helen. - Thank you Bronson, it'll be great to get you back to your spot here at the WNN anchor desk. We take you now to New York where Bureau Chief Maury Boswell-- - Okay, New York's comin' up. - About what might happen. - New York's got the line, okay great. - [Helen] Decides to use chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons. - [Robert] Take care of this for me will you, Jim? - For now though, most-- - I need more light in the studio and I need it in 10 minutes, all right? When I'm back from New York in 10, I need more light, see if you can get it for me okay? Take care of that. Okay Helen, you're clear. - Robert, is Bronson still on the line? - Yes ma'am. - Good, could you patch him through to me please? I really need to talk to him. - Yeah sure thing, go. (planes humming) - Bronson are you there, is it as bad as it looks? - I've never seen anything like it. It's like everyone is just assuming there's no turning back. - I just can't believe all this is happening and we're so far apart. I miss you so much, Bronson. - I miss you too, Helen. But I gotta be here right now. Every world leader is watching this thing through us. Maybe I can help. Maybe I can get them to see what is really about to happen. (explosion booms) - What was that? - Just some guys testing some weapons. Don't worry about it, I'll be home soon. - You promise? - Hey, I'm the most trusted guy in the world, remember? - Well then I guess I'll just have to believe-- - I gotta go, I love you. (explosion booms) - I love you too. (anxious steady drumbeat) - Indeed as WNN begins today to simultaneously broadcast via television, the internet and even the 70,000 electronic billboards like this one, it seems almost providential that such technology is coming online at this exact moment. The all too real threat of nuclear war has just about everyone on the planet glued to the latest news. Whether it is the United States, Russia, China or Australia, we all seem to be realizing for perhaps to first time that we are all indeed in exactly the same boat. Well hopefully this new technology will help us to truly come together before we annihilate one another. For WNN, this is Janet Shutt. - Jim, any word from Bronson yet? - Sorry Helen, nothing yet. - He'll be all right, Helen. Jim and I have our whole church praying for him. - Thanks Suzy looks like we'll need all the help we can get. - I'm not a religious man myself but God help us all. - [Suzette] Amen to that. - Hey everybody, look who's going live. - Yes! - All right. - All right people, let's get ready. We're going live when he's done. All right folks, we're going live in three, two-- - Events here in the Middle East took a horrifying turn for the worse a few minutes ago. We have confirmed reports that Israel's largest city Tel Aviv has been hit with a series of chemical warheads that have been spreading deadly poison across the region as quickly as the wind will carry it. Command Leader General Alizar had this to say a few minutes ago. (explosion booms) - Right now as I speak these words, a deadly cloud is traveling across the Israeli countryside, killing every living thing it touches. Even gas masks are useless against these chemicals. This cloud does not care if you are a soldier or a civilian, an adult or a baby, a Jew or a Palestinian. It will not destroy military targets, communication outposts, transportation links or airfields. Instead it has only one purpose. To kill innocent people and to try to finish the job that Hitler started and failed. - Clearly the General means what he is saying and right now the activity in the air above us has intensified almost beyond belief. Enormous explosions in the distance have rocked the ground we're standing on. (explosion booms) We have confirmed reports now the US Aircraft Carrier Nebraska has just been hit by a torpedo from a Chinese nuclear submarine. No confirmation yet on what type of weapon was used but we do have confirmation that the Nebraska has been destroyed and its crew of nearly 5,000 men and women are presumed dead. We're still waiting for an official statement from the Pentagon but for now it's safe to say that the United States of America is officially at war. Meanwhile here in central Israel, the greatest military confrontation in the history of the world continues to loom this evening with an estimated three million troops now deployed within 100 square miles of where I am standing now. Another two million are reported to be less than three hours away. Clearly everything we are seeing is pointing in the direction of a battle the likes of which this world has never seen. Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have now been used and unless someone hits the brake, our future may be a short one. For WNN, I'm Bronson Pearl near Armageddon, Israel. - Clearly the almost inevitable conclusion that a nuclear device of some kind was used to sink the Nebraska suggests that the war in the Middle East may be about to escalate into a full-scale nuclear confrontation. We have Dr. Stephen Horne on the line with us right now. Dr. Horne is the Head of Nuclear Research and Development at UCLA. Dr. Horne, thank you for agreeing to talk to us. - Well thank you. - How many nuclear weapons are there? - Well consider the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in 1945. In the nuclear stockpile today, we would have the equivalent of 700,000 of those bombs. To put it more dramatically, that would amount to four tons of TNT for every man, woman and child in the world. It's like having your own Oklahoma City truck bomb for each and every one of us-- - I'm sorry, Dr. Horne. We interrupt this statement to take you now to David Boyle in Beijing, China for this update. - [David] Helen, the footage you are seeing is less than 90 seconds old. I'm standing here not a quarter mile from the Chinese Defense Ministry Headquarters which as you can see has just been rocked by an enormous explosion. We were waiting here for a statement from the Chinese on the attack on the Nebraska when the building just burst into flames. Then within a matter of seconds, the entire structure just caved in on itself. There is no doubt that what we have just witnessed is a US retaliation for an attack on the Nebraska and that our planet has just edged closer to the brink of World War Three. David Boyle, WNN Beijing. - Ladies and gentlemen, we have just received word from NORAD Command that several land-based nuclear missile launches have now been detected. We will keep you apprised as to their intended targets but for now we are advising everyone who can see us right now to take immediate shelter. - [Soldier] General Alizar, nukes inbound. Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, ETA three minutes. - You know what to do. Samson's Feast. - Now confirmed that a nuclear explosion has rocked the Soviet nuclear missile site on the Kamchatka Peninsula in northern Russia. No word yet on who is responsible for the bombing and also no word on whether or not the Russians had launched any weapons of their own prior to the strike. There is little doubt however that more nuclear strikes can be expected around the world in the next little while. We take you now back to Richard Stanfield at the Pentagon. - Forces not already in the Gulf are being mobilized in record numbers and the United States will throw every resource it has into battling these enemies of peace. A full draft program is now being prepared and will be announced within the hour. In the meantime we ask all Americans to pray for the... The President of the United States will now address the nation. - [President] My fellow Americans, approximately 11 minutes ago, several hundred nuclear weapons were launched against us and our allies by the enemies of world peace. The exact targets cannot be determined but catastrophic destruction is a certainty. Even though the policy of mutually assured destruction was intended to deter an event such as this one, it is also a philosophy that I believe must be carried out in practice, not just in principle. In keeping with that view, I have just authorized a counter-strike the magnitude of which is almost beyond measure. Those who would see fit to kill hundreds of millions of innocent people for political gain must not be allowed to take control of the world and the United States will not stand by and watch them do it, whatever the cost. It is indeed a sad statement about the human race that people would rather destroy the planet than open their minds to the views and beliefs of others. I am deeply sorry for what has happened. I am sorry that it has happened on my watch. God help us all. - The President's message is clear. Nuclear destruction far beyond anything any of us could have imagined is now imminent. The fact that the President is now aboard Air Force One suggests that the continental United States is indeed a likely target. Unfortunately the design of the warheads makes it impossible to know which cities have been targeted until only seconds before detonation. For all we know, we could be sitting on one of those targets right now, any of us could. We now join our Los Angeles affiliate station already in progress. - But it is unlikely that any kind of defense could be designed to protect us against such terrible weapons of mass destruction. I think probably the best thing we could have done would be perhaps to go home, say goodby and perhaps, oh my God, Charlie, Charlie? This is impossible, this is just impossible. I just can't believe it, I don't know what to say. My cameraman Charlies Tathis, he's just disappeared right in front of me. (car horns blaring) I don't understand it, people all around me seem to have been vaporized or something. - Look what took my baby. (plane humming) - [Crew Member] Helen. Are you okay? - Jim was working on the light, it just fell down. Okay. - Are you okay? (scream) - Brenda, she vanished. - What happened? - Jim? Jim? (anxious piano, violin music) That was no nuke, what kind of weapon have we been hit with and why are we still here? - [Robert] I can't believe it, I just can't believe it. - Suzette and Eve, they've vanished. - Oh my God, not Helen too. - Bronson, are you there? Bronson, please are you there? (helicopters whirring) - If they had a weapon like this, our intelligence should have known about it. How can we fight against this if we don't even know what it is? - Sir, we are receiving reports from all over the place. Planes down, men missing. Right here in camp, we appear to have lost at least 100 men. - We must have been hit by something, fight out. - General it's not just here, our live feed from stateside shows that people have vanished from there too. (anxious piano, trumpet music) - Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, it appears that something very unusual is happening in the world at the moment. We are receiving reports from all over the world of people simply vanishing into thin air. We are not receiving any news on any nuclear detonations at this time. So exactly what has happened is not clear. We will be keeping in touch with you on everything that's happening, so please stay tuned. - [Robert] Hey Helen, we're clear. - Helen please, can you hear me? - Bronson, thank God you're okay, I thought you... - I thought you were too. - What's going on, do you know anything? - No, I don't know if anyone does. But I can tell you this, all the nukes are gone. They simply vanished from radar along with all those people. The Israelis here are convinced it's a new weapon of some kind but it's hard to imagine what it could be. - I'm just so glad you're all right, Bronson. I don't know what I'd do without you. - I'm about to head to Jerusalem with General Alizar. Maybe I can find some answers there. - I think we're about to find out more, Bronson. Keep watching your monitor because we're getting some more reports now. Ladies and gentlemen, we are receiving reports from all around the world that may shed some light on exactly what might have happened. We'll start with videographer Allen Camberough in London. - [Allen] The situation here in central England is absolutely out of control. There are hardly words to describe it with reports of tens of thousands of I guess what you would have to call vanishings now reported, the impact has been staggering. Here on a highway not far from London, thousands of vehicles suddenly became deadly projectiles when their drivers simply disappeared into thin air. - [Reporter] And while the degree of carnage is staggering, almost everyone agrees it is only a fraction of the nuclear devastation we expected only a few moments ago. - [Reporter] It's almost impossible to comprehend in a tiny Swiss village this is the scene after a suddenly unmanned passenger train with more than 60 cars raced into a train station at full speed, smashing into the back of another train without warning. This aircraft plummeted to the ground in a huge fireball an instant after the tower lost contact with the pilot. This helicopter lost altitude without explanation and crashed into the water below. The pilot's clothes were found but no body was recovered. - [Reporter] Citizens around the word are reacting in the only way most people could expect, with total panic. Here in Tokyo, hundreds of people were gathered around this lobby listening to a top government official. He was announcing his belief that the Battle of Armageddon was actually a fulfillment of ancient prophecy. As he spoke however, he vanished in front of them, leaving only a neatly folded pile of clothes where he stood only seconds before. No one could possibly have known that the same thing had happened in every city on earth. - [Reporter] And no matter where you look around the world, it seems that almost everyone has lost someone and there is total mayhem on city streets everywhere as people rush around trying to find their loved ones. The only evidence that they were ever even here is the neatly folded piles of clothes that lie from one end of the globe to the other. - [Reporter] So what in the world happened? No one seems to have the first idea but there are a few things we do know. First of all NATO Command now confirms that every nuclear weapon that was in flight at the time of this event did indeed also disappear. Where the people went however is anyone's guess. NASA and the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia report no sighting from beyond this world, at least none that our instruments can detect. - [Newscaster] On the military front, all hostilities have simply ceased in chaos and confusion. Any military forces that can be spared patrol the borders of their respective nations. But not one of those nations has any idea who or what they are looking for. - [Reporter] Looting and rioting are commonplace and as one New York Police Chief told us, it's as if a cloud of evil suddenly descended upon us tonight. Unfortunately many of the world's peace officers are being forced to pay the price. - [Reporter] There is no doubt that panic and mayhem have had the run for much of the day. Grief has set in and millions are having to grapple with the reality that they may well have seen their loved ones for the very last time. Mothers have lost babies, fathers have lost sons, wives have lost husbands. - [Reporter] No matter where you turn or who you talk to, it seems that almost everyone has lost someone. At the same time, everyone must be wondering who might be next? - [Janet] How can one man disappear from his seat in an airplane, leaving another passenger just sitting there? Why were they taken, why were we left behind? For WNN, I'm Janet Shutt. - [Announcer] One world, one network, this is WNN. - We have just been able to establish a link up with Bronson Pearl who is now reporting from near the Western Wall in Old Jerusalem. - Obviously Helen, today is a date that will be remembered forever. As long as any of us live, we'll all remember exactly where we were at noon today. The entire world is in a total state of shock. The entire world except for one man, that is. As reported yesterday, European Union President Franco Macalusso predicted that missiles and bombs were no match for the will of a united mankind. While today nuclear weapons that were in the air vanished just seconds after millions of people did the same, a tape of President Macalusso on the Mount of Olives earlier today has just been released to WNN. We take you to that now. - My children, I come to you today not in the name of another but in my own name. Let there be no mistake and no misunderstanding. I was the one who created you, who loved you and watched you grow. Today you know the truth. You know that had I not intervened, you would have destroyed yourselves. My creation. But that intervention has come at a cost. I have had to remove some of the children because they had chosen the way of hate. But today is the dawn of a new era, an era of peace and prosperity. I am the God of your Fathers. I am that I am. (anxious steady drumbeat) - I've read right to the end, you're too late. - [Randy] Who are you? - Just someone who's read all the way to the end. - Stacy, get security in here right away. Thanks for dropping by, mister? Get him outta here, I said get him outta here. - Thank you, Agent Domi. I believe that will be all. I'll be taking full control of the WNN Network effective immediately. - What are you talking about? I'm in charge here. - Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. You lost everyone, right? - Actually I know where they've gone. - This is no time for fairy tales, my friend. The Messiah's already told you what happened yesterday. Your search for answers is over. - You may call him the Messiah but this book has another name for him. - And you honestly think the Messiah is worried about a bunch of crazies thinking he's the Devil? Believe me, he's not worried about that at all. That's my job.

But as incredible as the events themselves may have been, they pale in comparison to the bigger picture. - I think it is very important that the citizens of the United States and indeed of the whole world understand something very clearly. Without the direct intervention of God Himself in the affairs of mankind, those of us unfortunate enough to still be alive right now would be living in nothing less than an apocalyptic nuclear desert. - It was incredible. Clearly a direct act of intervention by God Himself. Airplanes simply turned and returned home. Missiles that were soaring overhead, bombs that were falling, even bullets in the air suddenly vanished. - One minute it was all-out war, then next minute it was all-out peace. I saw it with my own eyes and I still can't believe it. - Only later did we learn that the Messiah himself had returned to Jerusalem at that very moment. - On the other side of the war, the advancing armies were equally shocked and equally thankful for the incredible events on the battlefield yesterday. - It was truly incredible. Little did we know that Allah Himself had come to save the entire world. Praise be to Allah. - But thanks to the Messiah, not one nuclear missile ever found its target. Praise be to God for saving us from ourselves. - Whoever you are, wherever you are, you are hearing these words now thanks to God, period.

What should we be looking for as far as what's gonna happen next on God's prophetic calendar? - Rexella, we should be looking for the Blessed Hope, Titus 2:13 which is the return of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of glory that catch away all believers from this earth in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, 1 Corinthians 15:52 and this is called the Rapture. - Oh Jack, it is so exciting to think about the coming of the Lord when he's going to take all of those who have their faith and trust in Him home to be with Him. But you know friends, there's another side of the coin. All of us have friends and neighbors and loved ones who do not know the Lord and they're not gonna even perhaps know what happened to those who vanished off the face of the earth. Jack, what will happen to these people? - Well Rexella, we have a tremendous book and it has all the answers. After this Rapture, this world politician comes to power, 2 Thessalonians Chapter Two, Verses Seven and Eight. He will be a super deceiver and he'll try to let the world know that he is the promised Messiah, the Prince of Peace of Isaiah 9:6 and he'll tell the world, "I have come to save you from destruction." And they'll believe it because he confirms the Peace Pact for a period of seven years in Daniel 9:27. But he's not the Messiah, he's an imposter. He is empowered and incarnated by Satan, Revelation 13:3 and therefore the Peace Pact fails. For the Bible says "When they say peace and safety, "then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail "upon a woman with child and they shall not escape." - He'll rise and the world will accept him as a peacemaker and he's going to bring peace on the entire globe. Now does the Bible spell this out in great detail? - Rexella, this book is tremendous and the facts are there. The Bible teaches that this world politician is going to come to power and be accepted because of his peace program. Daniel 11:21 says "He comes in peaceably." Daniel 11:24, "He enters in peaceably." And he confirms... (anxious violin tones) Fails, why? Because this one who has claimed to be the Messiah has been nothing but a deceiver. - Open your heart to Jesus Christ. You say to me "Well Luis, how shall I do it? "What do I have to do?" Listen and I give you the invitation. Jesus says "I stand at your door and knock. "If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, "I will come into you and eat with you and you with me." In other words, all you and I have to do is simply say "Lord Jesus, the door is open, come in." And He says "I will come into you." But the decision is yours and right now, I hope that many of you have come prepared by God with an open mind, with a hungry heart and you'll say "Lord Jesus, I want eternal life. "I want to know you as a good God. "I want to be forgiven Lord because I need "your forgiveness and Lord, I want eternal life." (relaxed guitar music) - Dear God, please forgive me for being so stubborn. Somehow I always knew grandma was right when she told me I needed you to wash away my sins.

I'm afraid Mr. Sistilli's vision was a little too old-fashioned. - And you think yours is better? - Actually, the Messiah thinks mine is better. He's the one who sent me here. Everything I do here will be to help him create a Heaven on earth. - I see. And I take it the two goons in the studio are part of this Heaven, Mr. Parker? - Every great cause in history, no matter how noble had idiots and backward thinkers getting in the way. We'd like to keep that to a minimum this time around. - You may be playing an even bigger game than you're aware of, Mr. Parker. I just hope you realize exactly what's at stake. - Oh don't you worry Ms. Hannah, I do. - Apparently we're about to get some great shots of the crowds there. So if I signal you, then you throw to Janet Shutt in Jerusalem. Helen? - Yeah Mike. Janet Shutt in Jerusalem. - [Announcer] Across America and around the world-- - Going live in five, four, three. - [Announcer] And Helen Hannah. - I am pleased to be able to welcome our very own Bronson Pearl back to the WNN news desk. As you know, Bronson has been covering events in the Middle East for the past several weeks and Bronson, it sure is good to have you back safe and sound. - Thanks Helen, it's good to be back. Actually it's good to be anywhere. - You're right about that. Bronson just to bring you up to date, we've been waiting for our feed from Jerusalem where President Macalusso has promised to shed some light on the absolutely incredible events of the past 48 hours. - Well clearly the world is ready for this broadcast. In fact, the numbers that I've been hearing are suggesting that this is going to be the most watched telecast in history. Clearly all the people out there are desperate for some answers. - We're about to go live to Jerusalem for that speech and our coverage will continue from London. So for Bronson Pearl, I'm Helen Hannah. See you again tomorrow. - [Announcer] One world, one network, this is WNN. - Children of the world, welcome to a new age of peace and prosperity. (crowd applauding) Welcome to an age of human enlightenment. Welcome to Heaven on earth. (crowd cheering) I hold in my hand right now the most important book in the history of the world. Unfortunately, it is also the most misunderstood. A long time ago, a man, a deceitful and evil man, a man named Jesus came in my name and deceived many. But his deception has come to an end. His lies of hate, his lies of division and intolerance led you to the brink of destruction. But I have removed the tares from the wheat. I have come in peace and I have brought peace to the world. I have saved you all from certain destruction. This book has told you by my fruits, you would know me. Now you have seen my good deeds and my miracles. My children, I am here to tell you today that we are ready to take the next great step of evolution. I will show you the wonderful powers that lie within you, waiting to be unleashed. Powers that have been your birthright from the very beginning. What has held you back until now were those who refused to believe in the power of the human mind. Those who believed that our true power came from outside ourselves. I tell you today, the power is not outside yourself. It is within yourself. - This in my dressing room. - [Franco] It always has been. (crowd cheering) The power is not outside yourself. It is within yourself. - [Bronson] I'll catch the rest of this in my dressing room. - [Franco] It always has been. - Show me what she wrote. - Yes sir. - Domi, Probert. - Helen, what is the rush? - I'll explain when we get to the car. - [Bronson] So what's this all about, Helen? I don't think I've ever seen you-- - Just get in the car, it looks like you're not the only one who wants to know what I've discovered. - I mean you should have seen it, Helen. It really was a miracle, honestly. I mean all of a sudden this guy sets foot on Mount of Olives and bam, the whole world changes. Missiles vanish, war stops. Millions of people just disappear. Oh, and the timing. If he was just like a minute and a half later, the planet would've turned into this giant mushroom cloud. Now if he is an imposter or a charlatan, I mean there's no way he could've pulled this off. But I'll tell you if he is not the guy who he says he is, then who is he? - I think I'd rather let you see it for yourself than try to explain it. Why don't you watch this tape. Then you can draw your own conclusions. - So Jack, you were telling us that millions of people are going to vanish off the face of the earth and that the world will have peril as never before. Then all of a sudden this great man, this great leader will arise and the world will accept him as a peace maker and he's going to bring peace on the entire globe. Now does the Bible spell this out in great detail? Rexella, this book is tremendous and the facts are there. The Bible teaches that this world politician is going to come to power and be accepted because of his peace program. Daniel 11:21 says "He comes in peaceably." Daniel 11:24, "He enters in peaceably." And he confirms a peace contract with the nations who've been negotiating already for a period of seven years. Let me quote the text, Daniel 9:27, "He shall confirm "the Covenant for one week." The word week there in the Hebrew is shabua, meaning seven years. And so the world is going to say "Ha, "it's happened, peace, peace, peace, peace." Jeremiah 6:14 and Jeremiah 8:11, "But there'll be no peace." It all fails, why? Because this one who has claimed to be the Messiah has been nothing but a deceiver. 1 John 1:7, the infamous Antichrist of 1 John 2:18 and the world will really learn that they had been worshiping a false God, a false Christ. (anxious flute, violin tones) - Well, what do you think? - Wow. Pretty fascinating stuff. You and I should do a special report on that someday. - [Helen] What are you talking about, someday? Don't you see we don't have much time? We've got to warn the world. This Macalusso guy is the Antichrist for crying out loud. - Whoa whoa, back up the truck here. You're not taking this stuff literally, are you? Ah for God's sake Helen, you're a journalist. We've been talking about the most incredible event that happened in the history of this planet and you're talking to me about the Boogeyman? - I can't believe you can't see it, Bronson. I mean it's all right here. - I'll tell you what I see, Helen. I see somebody that needs to take a step back just for a minute here. We've all been through a lot here in the past two days. We thought the world was gonna end. Why don't we just go back to the studio? - I'm not going back. - What are you talking about? - I'm not going back. Look, if you're blind to what's going on here, then that's between you and God. But I know the truth about Macalusso and I'm not gonna join you in telling the world what a great guy he is. - You know, out of all the people that I know, I thought you'd be the last person who would get caught up in a religious cult. - It's clear, Bronson and if you'd just open up that steel trap of yours, you'd see it too. What's it gonna take for you to believe this is for real? - Do you know what it'll take, Helen? When Macalusso shows up for that speech tomorrow carrying a pitchfork. - Please. - Oh look Helen, come on now. Up until now it's always been seeing is believing with you and I, now you want to turn that around and what you're seeing is what you want to believe. - Well and you're refusing to see what you don't want to believe. Oh look, look, maybe you're not ready to fall on your knees and frankly I'm not asking you to. You know, of all the people I know, I'd have thought you'd a been the last person just to dismiss something this big without even looking at it. - Look, I am not saying there's nothing to it. My father spent his entire life believing it. It made him a happier man. In fact I think it made him a better man. But I'll tell you at the end of the day, he still ended up dead just like the rest of us will. - No Bronson, his earthly body may have died but his soul is still very much alive. - Oh, I wish I could believe that Helen. Honest to God I do. Look, I have met President Macalusso myself. I have seen what he's done with my own eyes. He's not evil, in fact he is the furthest thing from evil. I mean look at what he's done here, he has rid the world of hatred. Now you have to admit, he has saved us from our most imminent destruction. Now he wants to unite the world in peace. Now I wasn't there when Jesus turned the water into wine but I was there for this and he is the guy who he says he is, Helen. - Can we just forget our emotions for a few minutes and look at this professionally? Okay? Okay, we have a guy who's making some pretty gigantic claims about himself, sure he's impressive. But we have some very strong evidence that he might be an imposter. Now shouldn't we as journalists at least check it out? - Okay. Let's take it from the start here. Now this Antichrist character, he's supposed to come out of the Roman Empire right? - Yeah. Yeah, that's right and according to this encyclopedia, the European Union, it's virtually identical geographically to the Roman Empire of Biblical times. - Okay, that's pretty interesting, now what else is there? - Not a bad picture for a camera half the size of a frozen pea. I just slid it right under the door and voila, our evening's entertainment. - Just hope they don't see it. - Not a chance, this thing is so tiny, you wouldn't see it even if you were looking for it. - [Helen] Wow, there sure have been a lot of fulfillments in the past what, two days? There's still a few more things we're waiting for though. I think the biggest one would be this seven year treaty between Israel and the rest of the world. - No I'm sorry, I just can't accept this. Whether it's compelling, whether it's interesting, this is just ludicrous. I am a professional journalist, for God's sake and I mean I'm listening, I worrying about some bad dreams of some ancient shepherd? - Bronson, I thought-- - I'm going back to the studio and I'll cover you the best that I can until you sit here and think and come back to your senses. But Helen I am telling you with every bone in my body, you're going right off the deep end and I am not going with you. - Bronson. - And you can tell your God, if He has something to say to me, He knows where I live.

But I guess I should, huh? Trouble in paradise, Len? - [Len] Where is Ms. Hannah, Mr. Pearl? - Well how should I know, have you called her house? - Cut the bull Pearl, where is she? - I just told you, I don't know. What's going on here? - [Helen] No Bronson, his earthly body may have died but his soul is still very much alive. - [Bronson] Oh, I wish I could believe that Helen. Honest to God I do. - So, what do you believe Mr. Pearl? - You got the tape, you figure it out. - Does that mean you don't know? That you haven't made a decision? - Look, I just walked out on the woman that I love. That should tell you what I believe. - We need to know that you support our Messiah. - I'm sure not here because I support you. - Helen's missing, Mr. Pearl. We just hope she's not going to do anything stupid and put herself in danger. - Danger? You mean you, right? - It's my job to protect the interests of the Messiah and the peace and unity of this world. - What exactly is that supposed to mean? - It means anger and hatred are the enemies now and I will do whatever I have to to eliminate every source of anger and hatred that I can find. - Eliminate? Don't beat around the bush here. What exactly do you mean when you say eliminate? You're talking about killing them, right? - Look Mr. Pearl, don't act like I'm the enemy because I'm not. I'm just trying to serve the Messiah and help him bring peace and unity to the world. Who could possibly have a problem with that? - Said the spider to the fly. (anxious ensemble tones) Thanks Mike. (telephone ringing) - [Edna] Hello, this is Edna, please leave me a message. - [Bronson] Helen, are you there? Please Helen, pick up the phone. Come on Helen, where are you? - Mike, I understand you're the guy who can help me. I have a bit of a concern. - Sure. What's up, Chief? - I'm a little worried that someone might say something damaging on the air. - Well we could set up a 12 second delay system. - What's that mean? - It just means that you'll have 12 seconds to review every transmission before it gets sent out to the world. We do it on live call-in shows all the time. - Okay, set it up. Oh, and don't mention this to anyone okay? We don't want to alarm anyone or make them think we're worried about the haters. - Consider it done. - [Announcer] Across America and around the world, you're watching WNN with Bronson Pearl and Helen Hannah. - Hello I'm Bronson Pearl, Helen is on special assignment. As the situation in Europe and the Middle East continues to look better than ever, many are hoping that events will take another quantum leap sometime soon. President Macalusso has been meeting with world leaders in Bonn, Germany for the past nine hours and an announcement is expected any time now. Of course we'll bring you that live when it happens. Right now with more on the situation in Bonn, here's Sam Metcalf. - It has now been confirmed that Foreign Ministers from the European Union as well as leading religious dignitaries from around the world have been meeting all night in this German government building. The attendees began arriving late last evening, apparently being summoned by the man we had all believed to be the European Union President. In fact however it is now agreed by virtually the entire planet that he is much more than that. Sir, can you comment on your meetings with President Macalusso? - Well, even with the planet being saved from the brink of almost certain destruction and the haters of peace and unity have been removed, the most incredible sign we have seen has been the realization by the entire world that President Franco Macalusso is indeed who he says he is. I think we can say that we are, yes, living in Biblical times. The Messiah of Israel, of the whole world is living with us and he's living today and thanks to him, we are living in peace. - He brought peace. That we knew was how we would recognize the true Messiah. He would bring peace. Did the one they call Jesus, did He bring peace? No. Only the true Messiah can do that. - I've just received word that we're ready to go live to the Embassy in Bonn. - As you can see on the monitor, the Messiah has achieved something today that no person has been able to do before now. He has brokered a full comprehensive peace agreement between two brothers who have been separated for more than 6,000 years. This seven year far-reaching agreement however goes beyond a simple peace between Arabs and Jews. It establishes the basis for a newly agreed to Constitution for planet earth. The Messiah will speak to the world shortly about these incredible developments, thank you. - Ah yes, a seven year peace treaty between people who have been at war for 4,000 years is clearly nothing short of a miracle. When we come back, we'll talk to our Chief Political Correspondent in Washington about what all of this means. - Well there's your seven year peace treaty, Bronson. That should give you some food for thought. Oh God, please show me what to do.

Today we're talking about one of the questions that every Christian has been asked at one time or another. If God really exists, then why doesn't He simply show Himself to the world? I mean He's God, He can do anything He wants right? Well today we're going to answer that very question by talking about one of the most important elements of the Christian experience, faith and faith is what lets us know in our hearts that even after our loved ones may have departed, their spirit still lives forever in the presence of the Lord. As the Bible says, "Absent from the body, present with the Lord." That even after our loved ones may have departed, their spirit still lives forever in the presence of the Lord. ♪ We circle winter, spring and summer to fall ♪ ♪ Spend a lifetime trying to make some sense of it all ♪ ♪ Trip over questions raised by fallen men ♪ ♪ As if there are solutions for the state we're in ♪ ♪ In a picture perfect world, there would be no crime ♪ ♪ In a picture perfect world, we'd be free ♪ ♪ In a picture perfect world, we'd be colorblind ♪ ♪ But it's all right, I know we'll be cared for ♪ ♪ All right, a place is prepared for ♪ ♪ All right 'cause sooner or later we'll be ♪ - Hi dad. What was it, dad? What made you decide with all of your heart to believe all of this stuff? I mean you never saw in your entire lifetime what I saw in this past week. This Macalusso guy, well, he is the real thing dad, I saw him. I saw him do things that nobody could possibly do. He did something not even Jesus could do. He brought peace to the whole world. I feel as if everybody wants to believe what this guy says. I want to believe what he says but there's just something that's holding me back. I can't explain it but it's as if something's tugging at me. Helen's part of it, dad but there's something else. (weeping) Oh God, dad. I wish you were here right now.

You've got no idea what you're up against. - I'm not afraid of you. - Well you should be. Don't mistake our talk of peace and unity for weakness. People want peace and we'll give it to them. They want to believe they're more than just flesh and blood and we'll tell them they are. - I bet you won't tell them the price. - There's no price, Ms. Hannah. All they have to do is worship their Messiah. - And if they don't? - If they don't, if you don't Ms. Hannah, you'll see a side of President Macalusso you can't even imagine. - I don't have to imagine, Mr. Parker. You see I know what's going on. I've read the Bible right to the end. - Then you know you can't win. - It's a battle for souls, Len and every man will make that choice for himself. - They don't even know they have a choice. Do you have any idea who he is and what he's capable of? You worship him or you die, that's your choice. - Today is your day. I am about to show you wonders beyond anything you have ever imagined. I am here to lead you into a whole new world of possibilities. In this new world, you will discover the powers of divinity that I have buried deep within your soul. But you must go together as a single creation. You know how I have removed the tares from the wheat. But even having seen this, there are those who have chosen not to join in this great moment. It is as if they are cancer cells in our collective body and I tell you today that until they have been removed, you cannot experience what I have prepared for you. (crowd clamoring) - In every nation the reaction to the Messiah's speech is the same, down with the haters. I am reporting live tonight from just outside County Stadium where tens of thousands of people gathered to watch the Messiah's speech on the big screen only a few hours ago and as the crowds poured out into the streets afterward, we saw tremendous demonstrations not only of the excitement about what lies ahead but also of the anger toward those who are still standing in the way. - Yeah, I don't see how these haters think they can put themselves and their paranoid ideas ahead of the rest of the whole world. Let's face it, these are the same narrow-minded religious ideas that have kept the world away from peace for far too long and now the Messiah is finally here and they're standing in his way, it's wrong. - I can hardly wait, the Messiah says that we're all Gods, that we have unbelievable powers within us all. - Yeah, we do. - Whatever it takes, we gotta get rid of those haters standing in our way. - [Reporter] And that's exactly what's happening around the world.

At this facility in Paris, world citizens are so enraged with those they truly believe to be standing in the way of world peace that they are continuing to try to attack them over the prison gate. Meanwhile the hunt for New Testament Bibles continues and the once-revered books are being burned from one side of the world to the other. What is truly ironic is the fact that the very book that had once divided the world is now bringing it together. Indeed, we are now witnessing the very unification of mankind that President Macalusso predicted before any of this began. The world is indeed united in a common hatred of Christianity and of Jesus Christ and that's the point I want to make publicly right now. I'm Bronson Pearl and I always tell you the truth as I know it and I must tell you this evening, I must tell the world that you're making a terrible, terrible mistake here. President Macalusso-- - What's this? - Is not the Messiah. He is not here to save-- - What's going on? - From the forces of evil. - I didn't authorize this. Kill this feed now before our 12 seconds are up. Cut to Ms. Shutt in Washington but don't let Pearl know we're not live. - [Bronson] He is the one the Bible calls the Antichrist. Those Bibles being burned-- - You get everything on tape. - Are not being burned-- - I can make good use of this. - Because they are promoting hate, not even close. They are being burned-- - Take him! - Because they tell the truth. - Take him! - Nah man, you're wrong. - Because they tell the truth. He is the Antichrist. - Kill the sound. This guy has nothing to say worth listening to. - Macalusso is the Antichrist. (screaming) (anxious steady drumbeat) - [Newscaster] Throughout the day today, we have witnessed an entire world united in a state of complete and total euphoria. The dreams and hopes of our world for a new age of love and unity are being realized in such a sudden and powerful way that the tribulations of only a few days ago are but a distant memory. Now the collective soul of mankind looks only ahead with hope and anticipation. It is the world's biggest global party and there is no doubt that everyone on the planet is now familiar with the name of the man of the hour. He is the man we knew as Franco Macalusso but who we know now to be the Messiah of all mankind. - Whoa. Move along. Move it. Let's go move it, move it. Will you knock it off? - Helen. - Bronson. - Move. Move it. (crowd shouting) Move it. - [Guard] Get going! - [Bronson] Helen! - Bronson. - Go, go, go. - Get up there. - Stop that, you're gonna kill him. - Trouble with our celebrity guest of honor? Bronson Pearl, most trusted man in America. I hereby dub you King of the Haters. (electric crackling) (screaming) - [Helen] Stop that, you're gonna kill him. You don't understand. - [Guard] Don't worry, we're not gonna kill him. That would spoil the big show. - [Newscaster] Even though every word that comes out of the Messiah's mouth is both glorious and vital, this message promises to be the most moving of them all. Not only is he promising to continue flooding the world with his love but he's also going to show us all the way to Godhood. - [Announcer] This is WNN. - There are more of these haters than any of us dared to believe. If they keep pouring in like this, I don't know how we're gonna manage to process them all. - Maybe once they see their beloved Bronson Pearl executed on national television, they'll take a step back and realize this is not a game. You're in or you're out, there are no other options and if they'd rather die than worship the Messiah, well then that's their choice but make no mistake, the Messiah will crush anyone who stands in his way. - [Franco] This is a day of unity. Of love and of peace. It is time for you to join me as I show you the way of total love and harmony. It was written long ago-- (electric crackling) That God is love. Have I not shown you great love? Do my Disciples not radiate with the love of God? Do you not feel a new love burning in your hearts, a new love for life and for others? That is the love of God. That is my love for you. - [Announcer] WNN's exclusive coverage of the Messiah's new world vision will continue, this is WNN. - You have no idea how scared I was when I opened up that lid. I mean it was like my heart believed it all but somehow my brain wasn't convinced of it yet. But somehow I did manage to muster up the courage to look inside and dad was gone. I mean it was fabulous, Helen. His clothes were still there. His wedding ring was there. His Bible was there but he was gone, gone home to be with Jesus. - Bronson, I'm so glad God reached you before it was too late. I've been praying so hard for three days straight now because I love you so much. I couldn't bear to see you missing out on God's love. - I really thought that my broadcast had gone out to the whole world but somehow Parker managed to intercept it before it went anywhere. - You know my grandmother always told me that God's delays are not God's denials. I'll tell you something, Bronson. You had a plan and I had a plan. But God has a plan too. Now which one of us do you think has the best one? - [Guard] Hey Pearl, ready to show the world what kind of hero you really are? - [Guard] Get ready to meet this God of yours, Pearl. - It's okay you guys. Our hope is not in this world, we all know that. I mean after all, we just found out that we're all gonna live forever. - Yes. - God loves us and if there's one thing that I have learned through all of this is we do have a plan and He has a plan. But no one is going to touch one hair on any one of our heads unless He allows it and if He thinks that's best, so do I. But what's so important from here on in isn't what happens. It's how much faith we show in the midst of it. (soft violin tones) - Well Pearl, you guys are always so concerned about ratings. Take heart, the whole world is gonna be watching you die tonight. (soft ensemble tones) - Bronson! Bronson. Bronson. Bronson. I love you, Bronson. - 10 seconds to midnight, Mr. Pearl. Any last words? - [Bronson] I'm Bronson Pearl and I-- - What is this? - The truth as I know it and I must tell you-- - What is this? - Right now that the world is making a terrible mistake. President Macalusso-- - What's going on? - Is not the Messiah. - What of our 12 second day? - He is not here trying to save the world. I can tell you the opposite is true. President Macalusso-- - Domi, Domi! - Is not the Messiah. - What's going on down there? - He is not here to save the planet from the forces of evil. I can tell you that right now, the opposite is true here. He is the embodiment of evil itself. He is the one the Bible calls the Antichrist. (crowd shouting) - Let us out, you fiend! - [Mike] This one's for you, Allen. - It's a battle for souls, Len and every man will make that choice for himself. - They don't even know they have a choice. Do you have any idea who he is and what he is capable of? You worship him or you die, that's your choice. - Open up! - God has provided salvation and eternal life for all who will believe. It's a gift, Romans 6:23 says "The gift "of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." And he provided that gift for you and for me on Calvary's Cross. 1 Peter 2:24 says "Who His own self bears "our sins in His own body on a tree." And when one comes to the foot of the Cross and views that precious blood flowing from His veins, he realizes that the blood of Jesus Christ, God's son cleanses us from all sin, 1 John 1:7 and then calls on the name of the Lord, he is instantly saved for all eternity. So why not do it? Pray the Penitence Prayer and believe Romans 10:13 which states "Whosoever shall call "upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Please look at me and pray this prayer. Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. You died for me on the Cross, shedding your precious blood to wash away my sin. I receive you this day and what you did for me. Come into my heart now, Lord Jesus. In your name, I pray this. Amen.
