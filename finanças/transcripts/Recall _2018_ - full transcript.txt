Akamatsu Transport I can bow down to our clients and the banks anytime. But I can't do this. Is it because... he reminds you of your younger self? No, it's not because it's Kadota. I don't want to lay off anyone. I don't want that either. But the way things are... we can't afford to take time training young mechanics. I know I'm soft. I know. But I'll protect all 80 of my staff and their families. No matter what. That's my duty as the boss. Resume: Kadota Shunichi Thinking back, it was just another day at work. Akamatsu Transport RECALL Am I going to get laid off? Why are you asking that? Everybody's saying we might outsource all maintenance. Come on. We began as a little repair shop. My dad and Taniyama made it what it is today. Why would we outsource the heart of our company? Mr. lida has been in touch as well. Well, that's... Hello, Akamatsu Transport. Yes. Thank you for your help. We're... a family here. Why are you laughing? - Just throw already. - Boss! Boss! We got a call... Kohoku Central Police Station Traffic Investigation Department She died... She died? It was at that gentle curve from Kohokudai to Kaminacho. The truck dipped when I braked. By then, it was... When I came to my senses I saw her... lying prone a distance away. It makes no sense... Your speed? Around... 40km/h, I think. Noticed anything wrong with the truck before that? No, nothing. You didn't hit anything prior to that? The wheel? The wheel flew off? How's that possible? He was heading to Yokohama Eon from Sagami Machinery. It was a mother and child. The child had some scrapes. The mother was taken to hospital... but I heard she'd died instantly. Who worked on Yasutomo's truck? Taniyama put Kadota on it. Kadota... Funeral for Yugi Taeko What the hell are you doing here? I'm sorry. Please allow us to offer our... - Get lost! - I'm sorry. Is Mr. Yugi... You're not seeing him. Nobody wants her murderers here. Get lost! Get lost... scram! I'm sorry. Akamatsu Transport Housewife Killed and Son Injured in Accident Freight Company to Blame? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I should have kept a closer eye on him. I cannot just let you off with a warning, Kadota. We'll be investigated soon. We could be shut down because of your negligence. What's that look in your eyes? Get out! You're fired. We're from the Transport Bureau. Who's in charge? Me. We're here to carry out an inspection. Kindly supply us with these documents. Operations records and staff rosters. I'll use this desk. Bring the documents here, please. I'll use this. Wheel diameter, one metre. Weight, 150kg. How did it fly off? Boss. Look what we found. It was in Kadota's locker. His checks went beyond the legal requirements. He even made his own check sheets. He went the extra mile to do his job right. I shouldn't have blamed him. I'll go see him. Yes? Are you... Shun's boss? Yes, I am. I thought so. Please, come in. Shun. Shun has told me a lot about you, sir. I was going to tell you. We're getting married. I see... I'm sorry, Kadota. You went above and beyond your call of duty. I should've trusted my staff. I was wrong. I hope it's not too late to say this... but will you come back? Somebody needs to take responsibility. That somebody shouldn't be you. It should be me. Please, Kadota. Come back. Kadota Check Sheets It's true your staff have been thorough. And you passed our inspection. The Transport Bureau's too. So why did the wheel fly off, Mr. Akamatsu? The public's taking a keen interest in this case. You can't pass the buck... I'm not trying to pass the buck. Hope Motors is analysing the cause. Let's wait and see. Before we take action. Yes, I've heard about the accident diagnosis. But I'm just in charge of sales... I haven't seen our truck since your people took it after the accident. Please. The result means life or death for us. Just ask your head office. We have a longstanding partnership, don't we? We can't possibly divulge that. Yes, of course. You're in charge of sales so you do the explanation. Stop bothering us with your constant phone calls. Of course. Understood. I'll do as you say. Sorry? What do you mean by that? I mean what I said, literally. We can't use Akamatsu now. Wait a minute, sir. We'll compensate you in full for your cargo. It's not just about the cargo. I don't want to say this, you know. It's all over the newspapers. That's bad for us. The accident is still under investigation. We may not be to blame. Isn't it because of faulty maintenance? Our maintenance was fine. Please let your superiors know. If we lose Sagami Machinery... You've received our best service for the past 10 years. The wheel flew off. What else can it be, if not faulty maintenance? Bank Of Hope, Jiyugaoka Branch I'm sure the police will find out the cause of the accident. I came today to request for additional financing. Financing for? Working capital. For cargo compensation and more. Can you loan us 30 million yen? You've lost your contract with Sagami Machinery, haven't you? Yes. Other clients will fill the gap. A loan of 30 million yen wouldn't exceed our peak balance to date. Filling the gap may take time but we can repay your loan. Only if we agree to refinance you like before, correct? Yes... We depend on your continued support. We've been doing business together for years. Yes, we have. However... your track record isn't the only factor here. The issue now... is compliance. Banks have a social standing. If we finance a company involved in a crime... our ethics would be questioned. I'm telling you there is nothing wrong with our maintenance work. You're saying we're involved in a crime? Mr. Akamatsu. Would wheels come off by themselves? I've done everything I can, but... the inspection's ongoing so my hands are tied. Please leave. - You're home, hubby. - Yeah. Have you had dinner? No, not yet. Dad. Takuro. You're still up? You're not a murderer, are you? Of course not. Don't worry and go to bed. Good night. "I never should've taken over Dad's company." "I'm not cut out to be a boss." That's what you're thinking, right? How'd you know? Don't ever voice out those thoughts before your employees, Boss. Times like these are a test of your worth as a boss. Leave Takuro to me. I'll set him straight, OK? Taniyama. Why do you think the wheel flew off? Well... I'd be hard-pressed to believe... it's an isolated incident. Without that 30 million yen by next month, we'll be... I'll figure something out. Our situation should improve once we're cleared in the investigation. Everyone, stop working. Stay where you are. I'm from Kohoku Central Police. This is Hope Motors' inspection report. The cause lies with the transport company. In short, your poor maintenance work. How can that be? The time now is 9.03am. We're commencing a court-permitted search. Drop everything in your hands. - And line up along the wall. - Move it. - Chop chop. - Yes, sir. We don't want to hold them up. Sir, it's Akamatsu Transport again. They want a re-inspection. Unbelievable. They've got some nerve. I'm done talking to you. I'll negotiate with Hope Motors myself. Who do I talk to? Please don't, sir. I'll be... My employees' livelihoods are at stake here. If I don't fight for them, who will? - But... - Tell me who to talk to. - I wish I could... - Just tell me! But... Sales Promotion Department. Sawada? May I know who this is? Akamatsu from Akamatsu Transport. It's regarding our re-inspection request. One moment, please. Thank you for waiting. Unfortunately, Sawada's out right now... Typical corporate nonsense. Sawada... won't be back in the office today. I'm waiting for his call. I see. Will Mr. Sawada be in tomorrow? I think so. You think so? Come on. You should know if he will be in or not. One moment, please. Not this bloody music again... Thank you for waiting. He'll be in tomorrow morning. Get him to call me then. He hung up. Sir, shouldn't you talk to him? No point in doing that. We're done with our report. - Talking won't change anything. - OK. I came across an interesting tidbit, Boss. There was an accident in Gunma similar to ours a while back. Mr. Fujita, the boss of Pacific Electric brought it up in the passing. So I did a little digging at the library. Large Truck in Roadside Crash Sounds like a normal accident. The driver told Pacific Electric the article left out some facts. What facts? The wheel came off just as the driver entered a curve. Of course, the police looked into it. Their conclusion was that it was caused by the company's poor maintenance work. Which was consistent with the results of Hope Motors' inspection. Theirs was a Hope Motors truck too? I knew something was off. It has been a week since the police raided our office. But you're still here. Not arrested. Which means they can't prove anything. In other words, the police investigated us but couldn't find any evidence against us. There must be a reason why that's so. In here. Nomura Land Transport Sorry to be taking up your time. Looks like we're in the same boat. So... would you like to visit the site of the accident? According to the driver the truck went off balance and skidded sideways when he braked. The wheel must've come off then. Hope Motors blamed it on us. Said we ought to have noticed the tear and wear on the hub and replaced it. The hub? But you're not required to check the hub in the tri-monthly inspections. Yes. But we're just a small company. We couldn't refute their report. Let alone go up against a huge corporation. It's hard enough for us just to survive. Same with us. - But... - I know. To be honest a part of me was convinced that Hope Motors' report was right. Until you called me. How often do you hear of wheels coming off trucks anyway? Besides, a small freight company like ours would never have survived if our maintenance was sloppy. Isn't that so, Mr. Akamatsu? Furthermore, the trucks in question came from the same maker. Do you really think that's a coincidence? Are you saying both trucks had some kind of a structural defect? Didn't Hope Motors already get in trouble for that three years ago? Did you think that would make them change their ways? A huge organisation like theirs? Yasutomo. Are you OK? I'm coming in. Boss... There's a possibility that your truck had a structural defect. I'm going to find out. So, you don't have to quit driving. OK? It's not that simple, Boss. It's not that simple. I don't think he wants to drive anymore. This accident has really taken a toll on him. Can you assign other duties to him after this incident blows over? I'm Akamatsu, I have a 10.00am appointment. Mr. Akamatsu? One moment, please. Thank you, sir. Please take this and wait over there. Thanks. I'm sorry, are you Mr. Akamatsu? Yes. I'm Kitamura from Sales. Something cropped up at the last minute for Sawada. I'm filling in for him today. May I know what can help you with? You can't help me. I'm not talking to anyone but Sawada. - Sir... - Get him to call me. Any complaints from Akamatsu Transport in Set a gay a? Yes, there were. You're well-informed. No, I just heard. Wondered what it's about. They wanted a re-inspection. Is anything the matter? No, not exactly. Did you make them back down? I'm not so sure about that. But I turned down their request. You did? Is there any problem? Of course not. I'll leave you to your work. Hey Sawada, drinks tonight? Muroi just came to see me. Muroi? From Quality Assurance? Yeah. One of our trucks was in an accident in Yokohama. Loose wheel. I know. We work for the same company. Remember? Quality Assurance did the inspection. Have you heard anything about it? - Why? - They might be hiding something. Like what? Like a mistake in the inspection. The hub was damaged? Yeah, in an accident just like ours. Hope Motors blamed their poor maintenance for it. Did they try to blame loose bolts for excessive hub vibration? I checked the truck's hubs. I have a column for "hub wear" in my check sheets. You'll see when the police return my check sheets. So that's why I wasn't arrested. You saved us. All of us. Boss... Can't we do our own inspection? I'm sure Hope Motors has whole panel of top-notch specialists. But Hope Motors aren't the only folks qualified to inspect the machinery to find out the cause of the accident. - A third-party inspection? - Yes. Our only choice is to go on the offensive. Boss, we heed you to concentrate on resolving our financing issue. Well... it's not a bad idea, I guess. It's up to you, Boss. But there's just one problem. We don't have the hub with us. We sent the truck for repairs after the inspection and Hope Motors replaced the hub. In other words, Hope Motors holds the pivotal evidence. Please don't do this. They're a huge corporation. So what? We're Akamatsu Transport. First, I'll drag Sawada out of his hole. About time, Sawada. Had to deal with a troublemaker. Welcome, sir. - Beer for me. - Yes, sir. Who's this? Kato from R&D. He was my protégé in Sales when he first joined. - I wasn't your protégé. - Yes, you were. - No, I wasn't... - Yes, you were. Are you drunk already? I couldn't listen to this sober. Now, without further ado, young Kato. Yeah. I hear Quality Assurance and the R&D bigwigs have been holding secret meetings. - Who told you? - Is it true? I'm very well-informed. So don't bother denying it. Your beer, sir. Let's get this straight. I won't say I heard it from you. I'm not your protégé, Komaki. We're back to that? Spit it out, protégé. All right, yes... there have been secret meetings. It's highly confidential. Confidential? Spill it already. Give me a break, Komaki. They are called T-meetings. Quality Assurance holds them and they are highly confidential. T-meetings? T as in tyre. Tyre? Why the focus on tyres? What's the significance? We need to talk. Come with me. I'm in a meeting. Can't it wait? No. I need to talk to you now. I hear there was a similar loose-wheel accident in Gunma. Hey, have you been drinking? That doesn't matter. Those T-meetings... are you a part of it? A series of T-meetings was held to assess the Gunma incident. The result was S1 but it was downgraded to S3, wasn't it? This is a Quality Assurance matter. Stay out of it, Sawada. Open your eyes for once, you idiot! If it were just a Quality Assurance matter why would I poke my nose in? Quality Assurance graded an S1 defect as S3. There is only one reason for that. To cover up a recall! That's the only explanation. Just keep your mouth shut and sell your cars. All you're good for is sucking up to the customers. Stay the hell out of high-level management matters. What? Come back here, Muroi! What was that about? I'm really sorry. Sawada... So you like getting drunk and shooting your mouth off? My apologies. Have you been talking to anyone else about it? No. But if they are covering up a recall like they did three years ago this time we'll really... All right. I'll get Quality Assurance to back down. But you're part of this organisation too. You really ought to remember that. I'm sorry, sir. Sawada. Forget about it. What do you mean, sir? Enough of your questions. I'm just relaying the orders myself. Orders from Director Hanahata? Something like that. Is our company on the level? Don't worry. Trust the management. Sir, it's Akamatsu Transport again. What now? They're not asking for a re-inspection anymore. They want the parts from their truck back. What parts? The hub. They'll inspect it themselves. Is their hub with us? I've asked Quality Assurance. They do have it but they refused to return it. Why won't they give it back? It was taken apart for analysis so it's unusable now. Mr. Sawada. Akamatsu Transport is on line one. Hello, Sawada here. So, you do exist. How do you do. I want my hub back. It's... in no state to be returned. It was taken apart for analysis so it's unusable now. A kid's excuse, if I ever heard one. I don't care if it's in pieces. Return it now. It's not that simple, Mr. Akamatsu. We inspected it on police request. It's needed for their investigation. They didn't ask you to hang on to it. I can't presume to speak for the police. Quit making excuses. Please understand that our hands are tied too. You expect me to understand? I'll talk to those in charge and do all I can to get your part back. Mr. Sawada. Is there another reason why you can't return the hub? Don't mess with small businesses. It's a matter of time before this leaks out. Who would do that? - Don't mess with big businesses. - Say what? Someone has to reform this company. My daughter's starting school. It's your fault for getting married. You were once married yourself. Biggest mistake of my life. Give me back my wedding gift. So, my man Muroi... let's see if you attended the T-meetings. Where did you get the password? Access to Quality Assurance files is strictly limited. I checked which computers have and an R&D one showed up. Your protégé? Bingo. No way. Kano Takes hi... Bank Of Hope, Head Branch Bank Of Hope, Head Branch This is a much less ambitious plan. This is a much less ambitious plan. We were overly optimistic about our new "Jet" brand. Unfortunately, our consumers can't seem to grasp its uniqueness. We're trying, but we may have to lower our profit estimate by 25%. I hope you understand. Has the Yokohama accident... been resolved? It was due to faulty maintenance. It's infuriating. So, that's the verdict? Yes. Well, getting back to the issue at hand... Miura will explain how we aim to improve performance. Yes, sir. To better the Jet brand image... 20 billion yen? A credit line request. They're part of the Hope Group too but their plan's too slipshod. Would you consider letting us handle the job? Yes. Well, that did happen, sir. But our entire staff is dedicated to ensuring the absolute safety... Choryu Weekly Enomoto Yuko, journalist So, lzaki... what companies do you do business with? Is this an interview? Is that why you called me? Did you think I wanted you back? We were never together. Oh, so that's how you see us. Come on, you dated Yamashita in university... Who do you do business with? I'm sure you can tell me that much. Other companies in the same group and their affiliates. I want you to keep this between us. A whistle-blower in Hope Motors reached out to us. About a recall cover-up. A recall cover-up? Not again. Yes. Hope Motors was exposed for covering up a recall three years ago. Their sales tanked and they hit crisis mode. Bank Of Hope kept them afloat. But their market performance is still suffering. Has Hope Motors really mend its ways? That's what I want to know. I want your opinion. So this whistle-blower... what did he say? I can't tell you just yet. I need to verify the information first. But if this goes public Hope Motors will be in worse trouble than ever before. Because this time, someone died. That accident in Yokohama? Hello, sir. I'm Akamatsu, here to see Mr. Shindo. - Certainly, sir. - Thank you. Financial Statement Tax Payment Certificate 30 million yen... Yes. Will you consider it? Yes... but I can't make any promises. It's the way our bank works. We have procedures to follow. We'll take every circumstance into account. Thank you. About my credit line request. I'd like to know how it's going. We're still reviewing your request. We've supplied every necessary document. We've received them, as we did the last time. We trusted them then and gave our approval. But your performance has fallen short of your estimate. Therefore, we cannot simply accept your estimate this time. How dare you... What an insulting thing to say. Our relationship is built on trust. This feels like a betrayal. Director, I can't work with such a hostile account manager. Kimoto, are you sleeping on the job? Re-educate your junior staff. If necessary, find a new manager and speed up the process. Got it? Understood, sir. - Izaki. - Yes, sir. You turned down Hope Motors? I did. Did you mention the information you got from that weekly magazine? I can't ask him directly. They are an arrogant bunch. That makes the situation even trickier. Someone is dead because of what they did. Why should we help a company like that? All right. I'll talk to Ma kit a. About their credit line request... continue to stand your ground. Don't approve it until they produce a more credible plan. Got it? Are you sure? I've got a plan of my own. Recently, a Quality Assurance computer was accessed without authorisation. This has been deemed a serious breach of security. We request assistance from Sales Promotion Department to find the culprit. Mr. Akamatsu? Let me introduce myself. Do you mind taking a look? Hope Motors Recall Cover-Up It's about Hope Motors' recall cover-up from three years ago. I believe it's happening again. Sorry, Sawada. I know this is a surprise. - Beer. - Yes, sir. What's this about? Allow me to explain. I heard you were behind the unauthorised access to uncover more information about the T-meetings and I had him invite you. Don't worry, my lips are sealed. But you need to be careful. Don't do it again. Actually, Sugimoto here has an issue with those T-meetings too. They shouldn't even be having those meetings in the first place. What are you going to do? It may be futile but I'm doing something. Whatever I can. Your beer, sir. Thanks. Look. Articles on the cover-up three years ago? It was unforgivable. Look here. "An external fact finding committee will be set up to investigate the matter. "Chief of Quality Assurance "Kano Takes hi will lead "a new internal ethics committee "to revamp the company's monitoring system." Kano Takes hi was promoted to Executive Director... Yes. Kano and the other executives are the ones leading the cover-up this time. Mr. Sawada? Are you Mr. Sawada? Yes... I'm Enomoto of Choryu Weekly. May I have a word with you? Finally, some progress. The wind's in our sails. If the media's onto it too... is there really a cover-up? Yeah. I'm going to throw this in Hope Motors' face. Justice is mine. Bring me some wine! Quick, I'm thirsty. - I'm not your maid. - You're right. I'll get it myself. - Orange juice for you? - Thanks. Letter Of Notification OK. Sawada Yuta Customer Strategy Chief, Sales Promotion Quality Assurance's T-Meetings Recall Cover-Up You want me to bring this up to the top? A magazine's already looking into it. It's just a matter of time before this scandal hits the newsstands. If this document reaches the CEO before that at least our section won't be held responsible. I see... you're meticulous as always. Director Hanahata. Yes, sir. This came to me from the president. Do you know Section Chief Sawada from Sales Promotion Department? Yes, but by name only. Did he send it directly to the president? No, it came to me through Hanahata. Hanahata's like an unarmed neutral country. He's of no threat to us. Sawada is the problem. Who is it that's leaking information? Anyone suspicious in Quality Assurance? Yes, you could say that. Who? Subsection Chief Sugimoto. Sugimoto? He attends the T-meetings as Muroi's assistant. A young chap... Now that you mention it, I remember him. Right. One moment, please. Our phone records list three calls made from Quality Assurance to Choryu Weekly. Other staff I spoke to think it was Sugimoto. But I don't have any direct evidence so I can't be sure. "Can't be sure"? Aren't you a director? Sorry, sir! I'll talk to him. No, don't. I don't want a confrontation. The days of firing whistle-blowers are over. We'll make him resign. Understood, sir. As for that section chief Sawada... don't provoke him. But, sir... He's just a lowly section chief. If he really wanted to he could've leaked the information. He hasn't because he still thinks he has a chance of getting promoted. What if he finds out he won't be? We don't know what he'd do. There's a way of dealing with men like that. Hello, Sawada here. Good morning. I'm Hamasaki from Human Resource Department. Good morning. We're from the IT Department. Stop working and move away from your desks. Come on, guys. It has begun. The witch hunt. They're checking all the computers in Quality Assurance. Human Resource Department called me. Human Resource Department? I bet they'll try to demote me. Thank you. I hear you wrote an interesting report. What's this about? I was impressed. It wasn't anonymous and you stated your opinion clearly. Anonymous documents get mothballed. That's our company's way. Before you speak you have to state your name. May I ask you something? What's your idea of the ideal workplace? There's no point in talking ideals. Each company has its strategies and are structured accordingly. Well then... what's the most attractive aspect of working for this company? Generally speaking, of course. Well, generally speaking... product development. Designing, naming and sales promotion of new vehicles. Most who apply to work here would say the same. And you're one of them? Yes, of course. If you so wish I can transfer you to Product Development. But on one condition. Leave your current problem to your successor. Put the unnecessary concerns behind you and focus on our ambition. It's for your own good. Or rather... the good of the company. Akamatsu Transport Let me do it, sir. It's the only solution. I'll lay the groundwork myself. It'll end this issue once and for all. Did something happen? Well, you seem to be in an awful hurry. How do you do? I'm Sawada from Sales Promotion Department. I finally got hold of you. This way, please. We've given close consideration to the contents of your letter. My department failed to give due attention to your requests. For that, I have no excuse. Please accept my apologies. Also, I'll do my best to expedite the return of the truck parts. So you're saying you'll return it? That's our intention. However... However? However, our organisation's ways can be difficult for outsiders to understand. To be honest, I can't be sure when we can return it to you. As a way to make up for it, I have a proposal for you. I imagine you're suspicious of the delay in returning the parts of your truck. It's natural after how we've treated you. We apologise deeply for that. I've heard that already. Could you talk like a human being for once? This is our proposal. Until those truck parts are returned to you would you allow us to compensate you? It's not what you requested but please accept this token of our sincerity. Please give it your full consideration. How much will it be? Mi yashiro... We need to know the actual figure to consider your offer. 100 million yen. What do you say? Will you consider it? Mr. Akamatsu, please. I implore you. Thank you. - Mi yashiro. -Yes? What would my father have done if he were offered 100 million yen? He'd probably take it to protect the staff and their families. Having principles doesn't pay the bills. What are you doing here? Give it a rest! He doesn't want it! Get lost! Scram! Mr. Yugi? I went to your house several times. Honestly, the sight of you people makes me want to snap. We're very sorry. Why are you apologising? I hear you're claiming you're innocent. Well... You're just paying lip service. What the hell is wrong with you? You people think only of yourselves. Someone is dead, and all you care about is covering your own hides. What did my wife do wrong? Did she dash out onto the road? Did she ignore a red light? No. She was just walking on the sidewalk. So, why did this happen? Are you even human? What if it were your family? Think about it! Imagine coming home to an empty house! You won't be able to go on like nothing's wrong if you grasped the magnitude of what you've done! Why... Why us? There are lots of people out there who want to die. Why did this happen to us? Here. You can have one too. Thank you. In Memory of Yugi Taeko Mummy told me she'd be making hamburg steak for dinner. I was really looking forward to it. It was a sunny day and Mummy was smiling. If I could have one wish come true it would be to talk with Mummy again. I've considered your compensation proposal. Yes. I respectfully decline. Wait a minute. Your proposal isn't sincere at all. It's like slapping us in the face with a wad of bills. I wish I'd declined there and then. I know it's rude of me to say this but how much will it take for you to change your mind? Money's not the issue here. Look at this. In Memory of Yugi Taeko Read it. And you'll understand why. Mr. Akamatsu! If I say I'm going to do something I get it done. I'll fight to the very end. Boss. Fighting for the victim is an honourable thing to do. But... you do know that by not taking the money you've doomed our company, don't you? You've abandoned our staff and their families. You, who vowed to protect them. Please remember that. Suit yourself. That was your last chance. What's wrong with him? He should've taken the money. He knew the consequences. The expose on Hope Motors will be published. Next Monday. The truth is going to come to light. Including who the real killer is. I heard it's going to press on Monday. Got it. Hey. Listen to me, Komaki. I respected you. I did. But this is one hell of an anti-climax. Then you fight. I'd fight if I could! If I could... At least you got promoted, Sawada. Congratulations! It'll last till the magazine comes out. The article's coming out? I'm not telling you. Good morning. Choryu Weekly Hello? The article has been shelved. Shelved? Till next week? No. We're no longer able to run any stories on Hope Motors. It's not postponed, it's dead in the water. Dead? But... but why? A management decision. That's all I can say. You know how much we spend on advertising every year... in Choryu Weekly and other Choryu publications. Besides Hope Motors Bank Of Hope and Hope Heavy Industries do too. It's huge. Who'd run an article that jeopardises all their publications? No company in their right mind would. Market forces, huh? Market forces. Today... we've come to request that you repay all outstanding loans to date. Your company could go under soon. Before that happens... please repay your debts. If you can't... we'll have to resort to legal actions in line with our contractual agreement. Bank Of Hope has accelerated your repayment schedule? Yes, that's right. If that happens, your accounts and finance will be used to offset the loan. What? I have a 20 million yen fixed deposit and settlement fund with them. Plus, I'm expecting a payment on the 20th... If so... I hate to say this... but it's over for you. Letter Of Resignation Why? "Are you even human?" Even after Mr. Yugi said that to us... I persevered for our staff's sake. I took so much abuse from our clients... I can't take it anymore. Please forgive me. I see. I understand. I'm sorry. Boss... Thank you. I won't forget your efforts to help us get through this. - Please forgive me. - Thank you. I'm sorry. I know the timing can't be worse... but this came for you. Yokohama District Court Yugi Masashi versus Akamatsu Transport Jurisdictional amount: 150 million yen Mr. Yugi's suing us? The insurance company says he's suing over our actions not the size of the payout. This could be the end of us. Isn't it a bit late to say that? Are you even human? Isn't it because of faulty maintenance? The bank decides if you're worthy. I hate to say this... but it's over for you. It was caused by your poor maintenance work. You're back. The school called me in. Takuro was fighting. With a bunch of kids. He's OK. Leave him alone for now. Why would he do that? I've been telling him... "If those bullies call your dad a murderer tell them they're wrong." What bullies? Take Note! Takuro's Dad Is a Murderer! You Don't Deserve to Live! I've taken care of it. You can't fight an invisible enemy. You've just got to face them head-on. Face them head-on? I talked to every one of his classmates' mothers. "Surely your child didn't post this?" The online posts got more vicious until the thread got shut down. I see. Don't get any strange ideas, OK? This isn't over yet, Boss. A year ago, I was put in charge of Customer Strategy. I'll put what I've learnt to use in Product Development. There's a lot I wish I had done but I'll leave it to my successor, Nagaoka. I'll sure we'll work together again sometime and I look forward to it. At least show me what you wrote. It might contain something I can use. - I can't do that. - Why not? I may be a journalist but I'm a Choryu Weekly reporter first. A Choryu employee. I can't show a shelved article to a third party. Honestly, I'm frustrated too. But all the web articles were taken down as well. A site criticizing Hope Motors was deleted from the server. You're going up against Goliath here. I can't give you my article. But you can have this. A list of accidents involving Hope Motors vehicles in the last three years. Your specialist knowledge may come in useful in uncovering the truth. It's also a list of people forced by Hope Motors to either accept poor maintenance work as the cause, or give up. That's what happened to everyone on that list. You're the only one who's sticking to your convictions and standing up to Hope Motors. You got promoted while you got demoted to Osaka. You did well for yourself, Sawada. I went about it the wrong way. I shouldn't have gone anonymous. I should have used my name like Sawada did. Because I didn't... the company could demote me without getting any backlash. Demoting a whistle-blower would have caused a scandal. The weekly magazines would have pounced. So... you're the one who tipped off Choryu Weekly? I joined Hope Motors because I loved the company. That's why I fought. I fought, but... Yeah. What became of the whistle-blowers? Opportunists like them are unhappy about how they've been treated. You just have to make them feel appreciated and useful. Our bank works very differently. We make sure they never get promoted. We only make them feel that way. I didn't say things would actually improve for them. The world is no place for those fools. Anal yee these surveys before tomorrow's meeting. These are over a month old. Why now? Don't ask me. I guess they came in late. Still, why the rush to get it out by tomorrow? Why? It's all you're capable of right now. What else can you do? We doubted the results of Hope Motors' inspection. But we couldn't disprove them. Neither could you, right? I've got to go. Shimamoto Transport, Numazu We have enough trouble staying afloat. I know, but... Just butt out. - Please, let me... - Leave already. At least hear me out, please? Inaba Transport Services, Ishikawa Kuroda Express, Osaka Why do I have to tell you anything? You're a professional? Then admit you messed up. - Well... - This is pathetic! - Let's talk... - Get the hell out! I'm busy. Quit bugging me. Hey there, sir! Our boss is away so I'll speak on his behalf. Would you be interested in working in Takasaki? They don't mind taking in young staff. Well, Akamatsu Transport is... I think you know what's going on. Our boss... He's still fighting, isn't he? Well, I suppose he is. But... with the way things are right now... I decline. Kadota, you've got a kid on the way. That's fine. Even if it's only just me... I'm staying with our boss to the end. No... matter what. I'm with Kadota. If our boss hasn't given up, neither will we. I believe in our boss too. - I'll stay. - I'll fight. It's about your accident. Sorry, I can't be of more help. Thank you. Excuse me. Here, the analysis of the survey. You've done it? Thanks. You may go. Well, since I analysed the surveys... You're not needed here. Back to your desk, Sawada. What's this? Back to your desk. Who did this survey analysis? Oh, we farmed it out to Chiyoda Survey. Chiyoda Survey? It was outsourced? When? About three days ago. Is Man a be aware of that? Of course he is. I told him. You've been to all these places? Yes. I'm hoping to make a breakthrough. I see. Hey, I don't see that company on this list. How did you compile this list? I didn't do it myself. I think it was compiled based on a news database. In that case, what about accidents that weren't reported in the news? I guess they wouldn't make the list. I see. What is it? Well, there is a company like yours that did their own analysis. They called us up a bunch of times. From Toyama. A company called Toyama Logistics. They insisted the cause of their accident was a structural defect of some sort. Good morning... Note that the new vehicle proposal deadline is around the corner... This is it. This is my chance. Mr. Akamatsu? Sorry to bother you. I'm Akamatsu. I'm Aizawa. General Affairs Chief, Toyama Logistics You've come a long way. I'm the one who reached out to Mr. Takamori. I couldn't sit back and do nothing. I hear your truck's propeller shaft came off. What was the cause? Poor maintenance work. According to Hope Motors, that is. But that's absurd. Come with me. Inspection Certificate You could've used this to fight back! My boss is an ex-employee of Hope Motors. He learnt his trade there when he was young. He said it was no big deal, so I had to let it go. My name card says I'm the General Affairs Chief... but I didn't use to be. Not until after the accident. I was the Chief of Maintenance. I've been working maintenance for more than 20 years. This was a slap in my face. It's like everything I've done had been negated. Your accident was caused by a hub fracture? Yes... Ours was a propeller shaft. Mr. Takamori's was a gearbox. I found out that the accidents... all share the same primary cause. The clutch housing. Clutch housing failures triggered most of the accidents. It's an undeniable structural defect. Defective trucks are murder weapons on wheels. Abetting that is no different from abetting murder. But... the pathetic thing is, there is nothing I can do. That's why I agreed to meet you. I've got to do something. So... I want you to have this. Vehicular Accident Analysis Report The results of my internal inspection. The report sent to the Transport Bureau was the one my boss got from Hope Motors. Let me say one thing. Mr. Akamatsu... These documents are my heart and soul. Why are you here? I heard you'd probably be in at this time. Well, I'm an early starter. - Good morning. - Hey. Is the accident investigation still ongoing? Yes, it is. Did you investigate what I called you about? The accident in Takasaki. I did. So what? Do you still think my company is to blame for the accident? I can't discuss that, you know. We're suing to get our truck parts back. You think I don't know about that? Do you know this then? This report is a smokescreen for Hope Motors' recall cover-up. Think about what's written in there. After you. I'm Nagaoka, the new section chief. Where's Mr. Sawada®? He was transferred to Product Development. A promotion. OK, it's done. New Vehicle Proposal, Sawada Yuta I'll be frank, Mr. Akamatsu. I'm not a pushover like Sawada was. What brings you here? Do you know what this is? In July last year Toyama Logistics truck was involved in an accident. That's the inspection report from Hope Motors that was submitted to the Transport Bureau. In that report, Hope Motors made it clear that propeller shaft detachment is extremely rare and unusual. And your point is? This is a list of companies whose trucks got into accidents. I wore my shoes down visiting them. Hope Motors blamed them all for poor maintenance work. From what I heard... several of these accidents in question were caused by loose propeller shafts too. It's not rare at all. Your sham report makes no mention of the other accidents. That's absurd. The cause was poor maintenance work. Did you even check if Toyama Logistics' maintenance was up to standard? I must admit... I didn't. Then how dare you come here and... Because there was no need to. It was a new truck, Mr. Nagaoka. The truck in question was bought one month prior to the accident. It had only done 320km. Impossible. Are you still going to blame it on poor maintenance? Your sham report was to serve one purpose. Prevent the Transport Bureau from finding out about the recall cover-up. Recalls are immensely expensive. With this report, Hope Motors gets to save billions, or tens of billions. At the cost of human lives. How did our Transport Bureau report get out? I can't believe it got out... much less end up in Akamatsu's hands. If it's submitted to court as evidence it'll be a disaster for us. Can you fix this? You mean accept Akamatsu's assertions? That's not what I meant! We'll get nowhere engaging with him! Why didn't you realise the danger of that report getting out? Why didn't you offer a compromise? - I'm very sorry. - Sorry. You're useless. Sawada was a lot more competent. From now on, ignore Akamatsu Transport. Yes, sir. Sawada, about your proposal... The first screening was just held. Yours didn't make the cut. I see. I thought it was a brilliant proposal. Thanks. Was it at least a close fight? Actually, it was the first to go. No matter what you come up with... it'll never be approved. Not because of the contents but for political reasons. Hello, sir... Boss! Just as we feared. Bank Of Hope Repayment Acceleration Notice You believe what's in that report? Takahata, it came from the suspect, no less. I checked with the Bureau. It's genuine. This raises a lot of questions but how does it affect our case? We completely trusted Hope Motors' verdict of poor maintenance. Wait a minute. If it were indeed a structural defect that would make Hope Motors our suspect. So we raided Akamatsu Transport for nothing? That raid was your idea. Don't you care how this reflects on you? The investigators can't do anything to us. If they come... we'll stand our ground resolutely. Will the data your company provided to the Transport Bureau stand? Quality Assurance and R&D have the original data under lock and key. Not one drop of it will leak out. In other words... they have no evidence to prove our report wrong. Sawada, I want you to hold on to this. What's in it? Minutes from the T-meetings. And all the information on the recall cover-up I could collect. I thought all the computers in Quality Assurance are under strict supervision. Officially, this computer was scrapped three months ago. It stopped working, so we bought a new one. I realised later it was a software problem and restored it. So officially, it doesn't exist. We have luck on our side. You're giving it to me? It'll be of no use to me when I'm in Osaka. I couldn't think of anyone else to entrust it to. I trust you, Sawada. Is this it for us? In Memory of Yugi Taeko Mummy told me she'd be making hamburg steak for dinner. I was really looking forward to it. It was a sunny day and Mummy was smiling. Mr. Akamatsu... I knew that someone died in the accident. But it didn't feel real to me. I didn't put myself in their shoes. For the first time, you sound human. Mr. Akamatsu. I'm not your enemy. I'm just one small cog in the machine. Talking to me won't change anything. Yours was the only face I saw. I heard about the report for the Transport Bureau. It'll be buried... by your faceless enemy. I'm keeping my faith. That all my efforts will resonate with someone... and a miracle will happen. Faith's all I have left. Why would you go to such lengths? It was a sunny day. On that sunny day... a life was brutally snuffed out. Let's never forget that, Mr. Sawada. It's the least we can do. Mr. Izaki! You've got to approve our credit line. It may not affect you, but it does me! Finally. I've been waiting for this. Sorry, I've failed you all. I'll wind up the company... Boss... Boss! Where's the remote control? I'm right outside Hope Motors' head office. At noon today Prefectural and Kohoku Central Police raided the premises on suspicion of Road Vehicles Act violations. Hope Motors is thought to have falsified accident data... Kanagawa Prefectural Police OK, that's as far as you go. Make it snappy! We don't want to hold them up now, do we? - Here too. - Yes, sir. Raid on Hope Motors' Head Office Raid on Hope Motors' Head Office All right! Boss! Despite support from group company Bank Of Hope, Hope Motors' performance... I knew you'd do it, Sawada. It's not over yet. I'll say it again. The report for the Transport Bureau was merely inexact. We were in the process of correcting it. You raided that freight company, didn't you? Are you admitting you made a mistake? Well... I'm setting aside my pride. You're not here just because of inaccuracies in the report sent to Transport Bureau. They are called the T-meetings, right? T-meeting Date: March 20th, 2014. Venue: Conference Room. In attendance: Executive Director Kano, Quality Assurance Chief Kashiwabara and 20 others. Audit Countermeasures Audit Countermeasures This is evidence proving that you were aware of the structural defect This is evidence proving that you were aware of the structural defect and you chose to cover it up. Akamatsu Transport's truck hub was perfectly fine up until the moment it fractured. You knew, and ordered covert repairs. All the directors were aware of it. After the last recall scandal and change of president... it became standard practice to keep recalls a secret. All of that is clearly documented in here. So what do you have to say, Mr. Kano? Where is that laptop from anyway? You can't intimidate me with these unknown documents of dubious origins. Hope Motors Hope Motors is a prestigious company. Recalls won't hurt the company's reputation but corruption will. Get it? I saw the victim's body. I wish you could have seen it too. Get it? You killed that poor woman! You did it with your self-preserving friggin' pride! - Good morning. - Good morning. Makita. Kimoto. You're stepping down. What do you mean? I won't let our bank's reputation be jeopardised by your relationship with Mr. Kano. That means your opinions aren't worth listening to. Mr. President! Hope Motors Directors Arrested Hope Motors Directors Arrested I still think I was right. I still think I was right. You're just lucky things turned out this way. - I get it, Miyashito. - No, you don't. That's why I'm sticking by you. You're our president. If I leave you to your devices who knows what else you would do? Thanks. Hope Motors must be really desperate to agree to a merger. I guess. Did your bank ever had the intention of approving their credit line? How would I know? Director Makita, Hope Motors' lifeline, was forced out. "Bank Of Hope isn't Hope Motors' wallet.” "We do not support corrupt companies even though we're under the same group." I'm sure someone in the bank must have felt that way. Well... I'm afraid you've lost me there. That's one way of taking down Goliath. Want to date again? We were never together, remember? Ha run a Bank Payable to Akamatsu Transport Sum: 300 million yen This should cover it. I never would've guessed. Ha run a Bank's taking on your debt? Impressive. I'm envious. Are you sure about this? You'll get burnt. We took all circumstances into consideration. People like you give banks a bad name. - How dare you! - Mr. Komoda. I follow compliance principles too. Come in. Pardon me for imposing. I went to see my lawyer earlier to withdraw the lawsuit. I'm truly sorry for the awful things I said to you. Please forgive me. Raise your head, sir. Mr. Yugi, please don't do this. Mr. Akamatsu. Yes? Hope Motors... What have they done? I want to know. Why did my wife have to die? It's a long story. It all started one day when I was discussing layoffs with my staff. Looking back, it was just another day at work. One phone call changed everything. One Year Later Mr. Sawada. There's one thing I don't understand. Could you explain it to me? All I found was the Transport Bureau report. It wasn't enough to expose the cover-up. Even so, everything came to light. How did that come about? Was it because someone in Hope Motors blew the whistle on the company? Beats me. I have no idea. Still the corporate man, huh? It's the only way I know how to survive. Go. I never want to see your face again. Same here. It's another sunny day. Yeah, it is.
