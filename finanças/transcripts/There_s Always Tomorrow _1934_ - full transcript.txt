Watch your step. -Fares? -Hello, Joe. -Oh hello, Henry. -What are you doing riding on a common street car? -Oh, well I gave the car to the kids this morning. -The kids have it too easy nowadays. When I was young-- -Oh that's alright. The young folks gotta have their fun. -It's fine if you feel that way about it. You celebrating? -Yeah, you guessed it. Anniversary. Little surprise tonight for the wife. About once a year is all I can ever get her out. The rest of the time she's too busy with the children. -How many have you got now, Joe? -Five. I only ordered four, but two of them are twins. -That's a mean trick to pull on a man. Twins ain't fair. I always maintain it. -Oh, how is that show down at The Mason? -Oh, swell show. -I mean, it's not too spicy. I can take the wife? -Oh, it's a wife's show! Some of the things are over her head, but you'll enjoy them. And she'll ask you what you're laughing at. -Well I got a pair of seats that-- oh!

First, they give you-- you listening? -Yes. Four. Then soup. They pass it around. Good soup, not dishwater. And then-- -Spaghetti! -Joe, it's like-- oh. Oh thanks. And that's only the start. Then you have your choice of meals. Oh lovely. Cooked swell. Or chicken with cream gravy, or roast beef. Good roast beef. -And how! -Coffee and a bottle of red wine. And here's , they ask you won't you have some more! -Throw that guy off, he's breaking my heart! -Well it sounds like a good dinner, Henry. -Good? Boy, it's swell! You can't go wrong. -Hello, son. -Hello, Dad. -Hey, you're in a hurry. -Yeah. did my shirt come back from the cleaners? Yes dear! -Oh, hello boys. Where's your-- -Well, we were just borrowing one of your ties. -It looks as though you were just borrowing two of my ties. Where's mom? -Oh somewhere. -I think she's in Janet's room. -Hey, Mom! -Oh Joseph, what time is it? -Mom, look. -Pretty, aren't they? -Yeah. Don't they make you think of something? -Yes, daffodils. -Oh, Mom. Don't you remember? This is our anniversary! -Oh. Oh, so it is. -I put one over on you that time. Come on. Now hurry up into that new dress of yours. And if we rush a little, we've just about got time to make it. -Make what? -I've got two swell seats for a gorgeous musical show downtown. -Joseph! -And before that, there's an Italian restaurant where we're going to have a grand dinner. Hors d'oeuvres, spaghetti-- -We've already had our dinner. -What do you mean you've had? Well we had it earlier. -Party? -Yes. This is the children's big night for their party. My goodness, Joseph. You don't remember anything. -Well I didn't know about any party here, Sophie. told you? Well, tonight is the children's party. I've promised it to them for a long time. -Well, that's all right. Let them have their party. We won't stop them. But you and I can go out and then-- -Now, Joseph. You know perfectly well they're lost without me. -Well, you make them think they are. Oh, come on. Let's forget the kids tonight. -Forget them? -Well, they are old enough to look out for themselves, you know. And it's about time you and I had a little fun once in awhile. They're all grown up and-- -Mom, will you hurry, please? -Just a minute, dear. -Oh listen, Mom. Won't you--? -Now Joseph, you know I can't leave the children. -Oh to the devil with the children. -Joseph! -Well, I didn't mean-- you always take what I say about the children so literally. After all, they're mine too, you know. But I don't feel they're more important than you are. -Joseph, get somebody else to go with you. -I want you to go with me. -Get Mr.McIntyre. -No. -How about Ernie? -I'm not stepping out with Ernie. -I'm sorry. I thought would do, but you're so stubborn. -Mom! Gosh Mom, I can't wear this. I told you to get me 15 and 1/2, and this is 14 and 1/2. -Can't you wear one of Freddie's? -He's already got one good one, and he's wearing that. And anyhow, I can't not. -Joseph, I do wish you'd speak to those boys. -Oh Mom! -Yes dear? -But Sophie, don't you-- -Here they are, dear. -I only-- I look away, above to see where are prepared for me. What's the matter, Daddy? Stop that , Marjorie. I'll hurry, dear. The dining room is ready for the party. -Mom? Why doesn't someone turn on the lights? -Where are they? -I have them, Janet! -Don't look so disappointed. You don't have to be a martyr. -Good evening, Mr. White. -Oh, good evening Ella. -I've got your dinner for you. And don't spoil your appetite with a snack in between meals. That's the way I lost. Nothing in this world that he wouldn't eat. Lots of good meals was the first nail in that man's coffin. And a good man he was. But good enough he gorged himself straight into paradise. There he is now. -How long have you been a widow, Ella? -I ain't no widow, Mr. White. I got my food! Funny thing about me, somehow I just can't stay a widow. I don't know how it comes about. First thing I know, there I am,. Well, come on, got your vittles. -Yeah, looks good! I love it. -Daddy? Mom says for be in the right evening dresses. I haven't got an evening dress. -All right. poison, huh? We'll have to wait until you get home to fix the furnace. I always have done it. -How many husbands did you have, Ella? -Well, counting the one I wasn't married to or not counting? -Count. Well, with the , four. -Why, four husbands! -Here they come. And Marjorie,. -Oh, hello darling. Hello, dear. It looks as though you're going to have quite a party. -Oh yes. -Looks nice, don't it! -Yes. -Oh, hello Helen! Oh, good evening, Mr. White. -Oh, no. No, no indeed. How's your father? -He's very well, thank you. -Dad, what do you think of Helen's new dress? sleeves. Don't you think it suits her particular type of beauty? -That's an idiot son you have, Mr. White. -No, seriously Dad. Don't you think it's swell? -Oh, it's beautiful! Yes, but even if weren't, you'd think it was. So long. -Daddy, this is the ladies' dressing room! -Oh, I-- I'm sorry. Excuse me. -You can't come in here, Joseph. -Oh are you Mr. White? -Yes. -Oh, I beg your pardon. Do the Fairchilds live on this street? -Well, I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you. I've never heard the name. Although we've lived here for-- -Why, Joseph White. It is Joseph White, isn't it? -Why yes. But I don't seem to-- it's the light, I-- -Oh, don't tell me you've forgotten me. It's Alice Vail. -Alice! Alice Vail! Is it really? -Uh-huh. -Well of all things. Gosh, I'm glad to see you. -And I, you. -Think of seeing you again. Here, let me take a look at you. Come down to the light, that's right. I want to see what you look like after all this while. How long is it? -Oh, you must not say it. It's too long! And it seems so much longer than it is. -And I've thought of you so often and wondered where you were and what you were doing. And here you come driving into my and right up my front porch. It's wonderful. Things do happen, don't they? -Oh and uh-- yes, yes. By the nearest chance! I was looking for some friends. -Of course, what name did you say? -Oh uh-- uh, Fairchild. Mhm. J.S. Fairchild I think the initials are, but it really doesn't matter. -Oh, I'll get the telephone book! -Oh no, please don't bother. -Well it's no bother. Glad to do it. I won't be a minute. -Here we are. Fairchild, eh? Let's see. J.S. Imagine finding you again. Here's a Justin Fairchild. Joseph E. Fairchild. -I like your old house. It's charming. -Fairchild and Mason. Yes, it's comfortable enough. Fairchild M.S. No, there doesn't seem to be any J.S. -Please don't bother. You have a. -Yes, it's a party. A children's party! Oh yes,. -Yes, they're still fine. I suppose they're all grown up, now. -Yes, mostly. Come on in and meet them. -Oh no, not now. Another time. -Well come on. I'll point them out to you anyway. There. Over there, that's Sophie. That's my wife. And that's the-- the girl at the piano, that's Janet, my eldest daughter. -Oh, she's very pretty. -Yes. -And there are the twins. That's Nick and Fred. -Twins? They don't look much alike, do they? -No, not much. But they're twins just the same. I know. And that's Arthur. That's my eldest son with that girl. -He's a good looking boy. -Yes. -He looks like you. -Oh come on, no kidding. -That's only four. -Oh that's right. I did say five, didn't I? Yes, let's see. Where's Marjorie? Oh yes, there she is. The little one that's wiping the cookies. She's the youngest. Let me see, that-- yes, that makes five. -Lovely family. Five children. That's qutie a family, isn't it? -Yes. I'll say it is. It keeps a man stepping. -I'll bet it does. -And where are you now? What are you doing? Oh, I'm at. I'm a foreign buyer there now. -No! -Mhm. -Well isn't that fine. I always knew you'd get on. When you left us so suddenly without giving anybody a chance to find you. Why did you run away like that? -Oh, I wanted to make a change. I was pretty young then, you know. -Oh yes. But you were never the flighty sort to do a thing like that. I was lost when you left me in the lurch. -I wasn't that important. -My right arm gone. -And I thought I'd left everything like clockwork for you. -Yes, you did. But it was only clockwork. It wasn't you. -I'm sorry. -Of course you-- you've married. -M-mm. -No? -M-mm. No. -You mean never have been married? -Not even a divorce to my credit. -Well, you must be an expert at saying no. -It hasn't been so difficult. Well-- -Well, I'm sorry I couldn't help you find your friends the Fairchilds. -Oh, I've forgotten all about the Fairchilds. -Daddy? Mom says please fix the furnace. You're in there. -Oh am I? Well, will you excuse me Alice? Oh, this, by the way, is the cookie snatcher. -Oh it is, is it? Oh. -Will you entertain Ms. Vail here until I come back? Well-- Ella says that with three boys around the place, you'd think they could fix the furnace once in a while, when Daddy gets home tired sometimes. But they don't ever! -Oh. -That's what Ella says. -And who's Ella? -She's our maid. Mom says she isn't much good, but she's the best we can afford. -Well are you have a good time at the party? -Not very. -Aw. -The older ones shove the little ones around so much, I get tired of being pushed out. -Well that's too bad. Will you stay right here and talk to me? -About? -Oh let me see. There's so many things we can talk about. I remember once-- oh, quite a long time ago-- -This is our father's and mother's wedding anniversary. You have them like birthdays, only for getting married instead of born. -Oh is that it? -Daddy has tickets to go to a theatre, for Mom and him to go together. But of course, my mother couldn't with the party. -Oh I'm sorry. That's too bad. -Oh Mom don't mind. She'd much rather stay with us children. And Daddy and Mom are going to have a of a restaurant. -Oh they were? -They have chicken and ice cream and veal and spaghetti and ice cream and-- oh a lot! -Oh, it sounds a lot. -Yes, and my father's sitting out here on the porch because their bedroom, and Arthur's bedroom, and all the other bedrooms are coatrooms. And Daddy had to eat in the kitchen tonight. I like eating in the kitchen, don't you? -Oh well yes, I like-- -Ice cream and cake and sandwiches! -Oh it sounds delicious. -It is! I tasted everything. And the cake is two kinds. -Oh it is? -Chocolate cake and nut chocolate. Well, I didn't bother to take a , but Ella says-- -Well Marjorie, did you entertain Ms. Vail? -Uh-huh. Bye, Ms. Vail. -Goodbye, Marjorie. -Nice to have met you! -Oh and I, you. The furnace all attended to? -Yes. What did she say to you? -You didn't tell me it was your anniversary. -Why, did she spill that? -And more. -Good heavens. What else did she say? -She told me Ella thought that three big boys should attend to the furnace. -Ah. -And she told me-- -The family skeleton. ---she told me that you had tickets for a musical comedy tonight. Why didn't you use them? -Well, Sophie couldn't go. You know how it is. I didn't want to go alone. -But you could have taken someone else. -Yes, Sophie wanted me to. But I-- -It isn't by any chance The Fallace? -Yes! -Oh, I've been dying to go. Why don't you take me? Am I pushing myself? -Of course not. Would you go? -Would I? Oh, I'd be. -Well this is marvelous. It's getting better and better. Oh, oh-- -Why what on earth? -The tickets. I threw them over there. -Were you that mad? -Yes, here they are. I got them. And now my hat. You're a wreckless when you just about-- -I am? -Wasn't she funny? I expect all night. -Me too. Well, they're still going strong. I'll bet they haven't even missed me. -You win. -What a night. -Isn't it gorgeous? Look at that moon. -And smell the air. Mm. Are you smelling? -Smells like spring, doesn't it? -Isn't it grand? -Grand. Uh-uh. Looks like someone else is being too. -Isn't it a lovely night? -Look at that moon. -That's Arthur, the eldest. I'll introduce you to him now. -Oh no. Don't interrupt them. Not on a night like this. Not when the moon is like that. You know? You should never interfere with moonlight. -That's right. It lasts a short enough time anyway. It's too bad that boy and girl love has to end. -Why should it? I don't believe in it ending myself. -What are you going to do? Responsibilities of life come along. Children. Things change. Everything changes. At least, that's the way it seems to be. I guess it takes to appreciate. -Well, you can't have your cake and eat it too. -Why not? My parents had their cake and ate it too. -But tell me, if your parents were so happily married, how is that you've never been married? -The man I loved was already married. -What about him? Was he--? Did he love you? -I never knew. He never told me. He wasn't the kind to-- to sneak around corners. I must go, it's getting late! -Oh must you? -I'm a working woman, you know. -Oh, I wish you didn't have to. I haven't felt like this in years. You've made me feel young again. -But you are young. -Well, perhaps. But it's been a wonderful evening. -I know that someday we may run into each other again. -I wonder. -Well, goodbye. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. And thanks for a grand evening. -Thank you. -Oh there you are, Joseph. Joseph? Are you asleep? -Oh no. -Well I think they all had a good time. Don't you? -Oh, I'm sure they did. Sophie, do you know anybody around here by the name of Fairchild? -Fairchild? -No. I never heard the name. And I know all the people on this block. Why? -Oh, somebody asked. -Well, you'd better come along to bed. Is that you Joseph? -Yes, dear. Will you go right down and do something with that furnace? The house has been like a barn all day. -All right, dear. And you'll have to fix those front windows pretty soon. The wind just whistles through them. -Yes, it's been whistling through my ears all the way home. I had a terrible time getting here. Oh Mommy, look! That's cute! -Now what are those? -Well, what is all this? It's the children's masquerade party tonight. Oh. The masquerade-- oh yes! -Hey Mom, how am I going to look? -Like a can of pineapple. -You look very handsome, Arthur. I hope it isn't going to rattle too much. -Arthur, what's Helen going as? -Julian. I didn't know him or I'd have gone with Romeo. -Be original. Engaged couples always go as Romeo and Juliet. -Your father's about to fix that furnace? -Yep, he did. Did they make love in them iron clothes? -The iron had nothing to do with it, Ella. -Not bad, eh? -Well, what's all this? Come on now, you've got to. -Well, what are you Janet? -Nell Gwyn. -Who's Nell Gwyn? -Charles the II's mistress. -Better go upstairs and change if you expect to get to your lodge tonight. -Yes. -It is his lodge night. -Yes, of course. It's Thursday. -The car. -The car, Mom! We've got to have the car. -What'll we do? I can't ask Helen to go to a dance on a street car. And in these costumes. Can you see us? -I have a slight sore throat, too. I'd catch more cold. -Couldn't he stay away from that lodge just one Thursday night? He's been going there for the last 20 years. -Well why couldn't you all go with your dad and drop him at his lodge? -We can't do that. His lodge is on the north side, and we're going south. -Well, we'll see. You leave it to me. I'll fix it somehow. But don't say anything to your father until he's had his dinner. It's a bad time to spring things-- on an empty stomach. And am I one that knows it. Heathens first. Take your elbows off the table, Marjorie. -Children, you know we shouldn't have started dinner until your father came down. -Well we're in a hurry, we've got a long way to go. -Here he comes. -Mom. -Do your duty, Mom. -Well, sorry I was so long. -Your new suit looks very nice, Dad. -Snappy. -What do you think of that, Mom? Snappy. -Do you think he will? -Well, we're quite a hungry family tonight. -I guess pretty sore because I read his novel. -You did? Who let her in my safe? -It's all about love. And two girls in it. One of them is-- -Skip it. -Speaking of love and one girl, how about the wedding son? Any nearer? -Oh yes, Dad. But not near enough. You know, Helen's used to everything, and I've got to wait until I can get at least one more raise. -Well, you're both young. -Yes. But two years is an awful long time to wait. -Alice did. -Nevermind. -Janet, how is it we don't hear much about you and a boyfriend? -I belong to the disillusioned young generation, Dad. -Ella says that-- -I don't care what Ella says. What I say, is I'm not going to be like Mom. -What's the matter with Mom? -Loaded down with a house full of five brats. -You're not brats. -I wouldn't let anybody else call us brats. -Well I'm with Janet. I'm modern, too. You don't catch me putting my head in any news, like poor Pop. -What's this? What's this? Poor Mom? Poor Pop? -Ella says-- -Hush, dear. -Well Ella says poor Pop too. And now look at the way he has to give up his car tonight and go ride in a street car. Ouch! -What's all this? What's the bean spiller up to now? -Well Joseph, I thought just for tonight-- you see, the children really need the car with their costumes. And it's snowing. -What do you mean just tonight? It's every night. -Yes I know, dear. But-- -Think what a handsome family you've got to ride in your car, Dad. -Let me see. How many times have I had this car in the last 30 days? -Now, Joseph. You don't have to be a martyr again. -Well, if I'm going to take the streetcar, it'll take me a little longer. -Oh Mr. White, there's cherry pie tonight. -Well I'll have some when I come home, Ella. -My goodness, Joseph. Do you have to open the lodge? Well the snow is. It took me a half hour longer to come home tonight. The cars are all blocked from 6th to Main St. -Mom, if you'll excuse me, I'll go get the car out and warmed up. -All right, dear. -Well, goodnight. Have a good time. -Snuggling up to your iron man, Helen? -Doesn't feel very comfortable. -But underneath there beats a great big human heart. -Come on, Arthur. Get ahead of that streetcar or we'll never get to the dance. -Who's driving this car? -You are, but your mind's not on your work. -Can you blame me? -Why look, that's Dad, isn't it? What's he doing way over here? -Maybe he took the wrong car. -Well, he seems to know where he's going. -Come on, Arthur. Better get going. -Maybe we'd better. -Look! He's going in there. -Well that's funny. Perhaps he-- -Who is she? -Never saw her before. -Why, what could Dad--? -There he is. -Hm. He seems very much at home. She's straightening his tie for him. She's pushing an EZ chair up to the fire for him to sit. Now she's fixing the fire. -She's pulled down the shade. -So this is where he spends those lodge nights, is it? -Oh Fred, you don't know. -This is rotten. Poor Mom. -To think that Dad would-- -Oh dear, please. -She wasn't so bad looking. -So what? -You're a bright boy, aren't you. -Well let's go on. It's no good staying here. -I'm not going to that dance. You take them Nick. I'm going to stay here. Going to wait until he comes out. I intend to know more about this. -Arthur, I'm going to stay if you do. Now, I don't want to spoil your evening. -Oh there are plenty of evenings. I'm not going to leave you here. -Well, the rest of you go one then. -Not me. -I don't feel very much like a party, either. -Well, I might as well stay too. No use of the going alone. Hey, get off of my tail, will ya? -What time is it? -It's a quarter to 12. -Well I can't stay here forever. -There he comes. -I always hate to see Thursdays come to an end. -Well, you could have stayed five minutes longer. -Oh no, here comes the street car now. -Oh, street cars will come too soon, won't they? -Well, goodbye. -Goodbye Joseph. -Till next Thursday. -Next Thursday. -She's coming back. Go on, Arthur. -It's frozen. -No wonder. All this. -This is going to be swell. -Oh hold your horses. -She's frozen, I tell ya. -Well, get out and take a look. Maybe the carburetor's flooded. -On a night like this? -We were-- this is a masquerade costume. -I see. I didn't know what it was at first. Can I be of any assistance? -Don't talk to her. -Is it gas you need? Would you like to telephone to a garage or something? -No thank you. -You're welcome to telephone. -We've got to do something. Go on, Dick, telephone. After all, it's better than freezing here. -I've been in predicaments like that so many times myself. Well thanks, that's very kind of you. -Oh I know what it means. Won't you come in? -Thank you. -Oh, there's the telephone over there. -Thanks. -Have you been out there very long? -Hello? We're stalled. Can you send somebody out here to-- -410. -410-- -Maple Avenue. -Maple. What? A half an hour? Gosh. Well hurry. We've been here over two hours now. Yeah, the car's on the other side of the street. The man says it'll be a half an hour anyhow. Well, thanks very much. -Oh, uh-- but you mustn't sit out in that cold any longer. Ask the others to come in and wait until the mechanic can get here. -Oh, it's an imposition. -Oh, no. It's no bother at all, if that's what you're thinking. It's too cold to leave you all out there like that. Please ask the others to come in. I'll wait. -Well thanks, but-- I don't know. -The man said it'll be a half an hour anyway. And she wants us all to come inside and wait. -What do you think I am, crazy? Go in that house? -Why not? After all, Arthur, it'll give us a chance to find out what she's like. What's the harm? Let's go in. -Not me. -It's nice and warm in there. -Come on, Helen. Don't stay out here, Arthur. Come on. -I'm going in. -Me too. -It's too bad you're stuck like this. Do come in, won't you? I know how long these garage men can be. At least you can all get warm in here. Won't you take your things off? -I'm afraid it's an imposition. Oh not at all, you're disturbing no one. As a matter of fact, I'm glad of the company. A carload of young people dumped on my doorstep. Oh, put your things over there, will you? I don't know many young people. You see, I'm a business woman. I have no time to keep up with the new generation. Won't you go in? Do sit down. I've let the fire burn out. I'll put another log on. So it's a masquerade. -Yes. We must look awfully silly in these costumes. -Oh no, not at all. Why, they look charming! Oh, and he's an elephant. I can see that. Pardon. I mean, they are an elephant. -Yeah, Dick's the hind end. -Oh he is? And they're? And what are you my dear? -Juliette. -Oh of course. I should have known that. And that's a charming costume, too. -She's Nell Gwyn. She's Charles's the II's mistress. -Oh but-- wouldn't you all like a hot cup of coffee? I always have a hot drink before I go to bed. -Oh no thanks, don't bother. -Oh it's no bother at all. If you'll excuse me a few moments, I'll have it ready for you. I'm a for romance. Wedding veils make me positively. I suppose it's because I've never had a wedding veil to wear. So I'm trying to live in others what I've missed myself. Oh, it isn't because I've never been in love. I have been. All my life. Well, for a long time, anyway. I fell in love a long time ago, with just as handsome and fine a man as you've fallen in love with, my dear. But here's where the difference comes in, lucky you. He was married. He had a wife and a family. A family of wonderful children growing up. -What was the-- the outcome? -Oh, it isn't a sophisticated story. I'm afraid it wouldn't interest you young people. -Why not? It isn't. And you are. I never told him my love. I just ran away. You see how it is? -Was he in love with you? -If he was, I never knew it. We were with the same. He was my boss, as a matter of fact. But it was too hard to stay on seeing him every day. So I cut and run. I thought I could forget that way. But it didn't work. So I tried to take an interest in other men. Oh yes, there were handsomer men and richer men, but none of them would do. I just seemed to miss him more and more. Oh, may I help you to some more coffee? -No. No thanks. -Have you ever tried running away from happiness? Well I can tell you now, it doesn't do any good. One night, when I couldn't bear it any longer, I went to find him. I made some silly excuse, and I did find him. I caught a glimpse of his children. And his wife was a lovely. Otherwise, it might have been a different story. I remember there was a party that night. And he was sitting on the porch, alone. I found that that was usual. He was always crowded out. I found out too that he was lonely. all that big family. The thing I discovered that night made me wish that I hadn't been so foolish. -Foolish? -Mhm. As to run away. Wish that I had a more sophisticated story to tell. It wasn't that his children weren't fond of him, or that his wife didn't love him. And yet, that has happened. -Why? Did he tell you? -Oh no. Not a word of complaint. He lied to me beautifully. But I saw through it. I read between the lines. He was very proud of his children, telling me about them and boasting. But I soon realized he was the forgotten man in that household. And what do you think the end of my unlived romance has come to? What do you think we do now? -What? -What? -Once a week, on lodge night, he comes here. We spend that evening together. And I make a fuss over him. For one evening, I make him important. Oh, it's little enough I know. But it makes me happy to do even this. Then on lodge night, he comes again. And that's the way it goes. He was here this evening. This was lodge night. Oh, can I get you some more coffee? I'll heat it up. -Well there, that must be the man that-- -Oh I'll see. -How do you do? -Oh you're the mechanic. -Yes ma'am. -You got here. -Yes sir, sorry I kept you waiting. -Well, you won't be long now. -Mother will begin to worry. I ought to telephone. May I? -Why of course. The telephone's right out there in the hall. -Hello? -Oh good, she's got them. -Oh-- oh, hello Dad. We're stalled, Daddy, and it may be late. What? No, we're all right. Oh, oh you couldn't find us! No. Well you couldn't. We just wanted to let you know. Yes, the mechanic's here now. Don't wait up. Tell mother not to. Goodbye. -Oh, all fixed? -Yeah, there's just the points. -I told you. -Yes you did. Come on, let's get going. Hurry up into your. -All right. -There. -And thanks for-- for taking us in. -You're more than welcome, my dear. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. I hope everything will be all right for you now. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. And thanks so much. -Goodnight. And may I tell you how happy I hope you're going to be? And I know that you can be, with that fine young man to take care of you. But oh my dear, take the word of a soured old woman and watch your love. Keep some of it always for him. And when the babies come, don't let them come between you. Don't get the loveliest thing in the world break up the other loveliest thing. Oh, I've seen that happen so often. He's a lovey boy. He deserves your love. There'll be enough to go around. Share it. Never forget that he's a lover. Children come, but they go. You two are always together. Here I am giving advice. I just can't help it. Goodbye, and good luck. -And did that woman lay us low. She hit the nail on the head if you ask me. And I'm willing to admit it. -Of course Arthur is extra sore at having Helen find all this out. -What do you suppose he'll do about it? -What are any of us going to do about it? -What do you think anyway, Janet? -Oh don't ask me what I think. I wish to heaven we'd never found it out. -Well, goodnight Helen. I'll call you up tomorrow. That is if you still wish me too. -Oh don't be silly. And don't take it so hard. Oh I know, easy for me to talk. It isn't my father. I know how you must feel. But try to cheer up. And eyes front. After all, remember what she said? She said you're a lovely boy. And you are. -Well, what do you think of your father? Nice mess, isn't it. Helen had to find it out. That's the worst. To have the girl I'm going to marry know this. Mother. How could we ever go back and look her in the face? To think that that man is our father. If I'd had a gun I could have-- -Arthur! -Well he's right. We might as well face the situation. -That woman trying to tell us that we were a rotten lot. Wait till I get him. I'll tell him. -There's Dad. -Well, I'm glad he's up. -Arthur, please. Not tonight. -Hello kids. Well what happened? Did you get stuck? -Oh, well I'm glad you called up anyway. We were getting anxious. Well, how was the masquerade? A success? -Oh yeah. Don't tell me you didn't win first prize, the. -Well there-- there weren't any prizes, Dad. -No? Well that's too bad. I expected my family to come home with a prize! One end of the elephant, at least. But you had a good time? -Yes, Dad. But we're all so tired now. -Oh yes, of course you are. -And you must be, too. Don't catch cold standing here in the hall this way. Come on, everybody. -Is that you, children? -Yes, Mom. -Are they all right children? -Oh sure they're all right. It's getting awfully late. Come on up to bed now. And Joseph? -Yes? Give the furnace another look before you come up, will you dear? -Yes, all right. -You go on up Dad. Fred and I will fix it. -Yes. Let them do it. It's high time they learned. -Oh no-- -Go on up, Dad. We'll do it. Come on. -Well, what struck your brothers this evening Arthur? They're very energetic. -Are you hurt? -I'm all right. -You better let me fix it. -I'm going to fix the surface. -What do you know about it? -What do you know about it? -There you are. -I've been here-- -Leave me alone! -Well all right. -Did you hurt yourself? Well go on upstairs. -Can't we help? -No, no. You can't. -Arthur, let's go to bed. What good will it do to say anything tonight? -How can he laugh? How can he joke just as though everything were all right? And he'll go upstairs to Mother and-- no, I can't wait. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell mother exactly-- -Tell Mother what? What? Why Arthur, what is it? -Nothing. Oh, was that you Dick? -Yeah. -Are you hurt, dear? -Oh no, Mom. I'm all right. -Well come along. Up to bed with you. Come on there, Janet. I'll hear all about everything in the morning. Come along now. -We'll come, Mother. -It was nice of you not to say anything. I couldn't. When I looked into her eyes, I knew I couldn't tell her. I couldn't hurt her that much. But that's not going to save him. If he dares to leave this house next Thursday, if he tries to put his foot outside that door, I'm going to stop him. Some way. Marjorie? Marjorie! Yes, Mom. Marjorie, go downstairs and remind Ella that this is your father's lodge night. -Yes, Mom. And to hurry up with dinner. -Yes, Mommy. Ella! Dinner! Ella! Dinner! Ella! Ella! Mom said to hurry up with dinner because Dad's going to lodge tonight! -I wouldn't take it so hard, Arthur. After all, he may not go tonight. -And suppose he should? Have you mapped out a plan of campaign? -Close those doors. You don't want the whole house to hear you. I told you there's no use trying to Pollyanna the situation. I have waited a week, and I haven't said anything. But tonight, if he goes-- -Arthur, I just can't stand it! -Can't stand what? Dad's going there again tonight, or it. -Either one. Both. -Janet, I can't face this awful disrespect to Mother. Do you want Mother left in this humiliating position? Believing in Dad and going on like this? -I wish we'd never found it out. -The percentage of divorces has risen to 13%, according to the last census. -Who's talking about divorce? -Well you are, virtually. -Janet, I'm nearly crazy with this whole thing. -Sometimes I get mad at Mom. Sometimes, I think it's her fault. -How do you figure that? Mom's got nothing to do with this. She's been a good wife to him, hasn't she? -Oh, I don't mean that they don't get along all right. But Mom never acts as though she cares for him. -You mean the way that woman did with him? -Well yes. Perhaps if Mother did that, he'd rather be with Mom than with her. -What are you driving at? Do you think that he has a right to-- -Oh no. -Well then, what are you're driving at? -Well I-- I just can't help recalling some of the things she said. -Eh. -No, snotting doesn't make them any of the less true. I can't remember a time when Dad wasn't just something to threaten us. Can any of you? When we were little, it was always, wait till your father comes home. He'll hear of this. Dad was always the bugaboo, the big, bad wolf. Isn't that true? -Sure it's true. And since we've got older, he's just the family checkbook. To pay the bills and no questions asked. He has been left out everywhere, just plain pushed out. Stop that woman! -Arthur! Careful. -Well, that's what she said. -There's a lot of it true. -Arthur, if Dad ever finds out that we know-- if you bring this out into the open it'll spoil everything. Our home will never be the same. -Janet's right, Arthur. There's a lot in what she says. -Well that woman's won you all over as well as Dad. -Hey Mom, they're fighting in there! It's about some woman, I think! -That isn't nice, Marjorie. -Oh, eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves. Don't listen at doors, dear. Hello in there! Where's my paper? Oh, here it is. Did I hear somebody say something about dinner? -I think it's ready, Dad. -What'd you shut the doors for? there suddenly wins. Well, that's more like it. -It's uh-- it's not so cold this evening. -No. But wasn't last Thursday cold? That was winter. How's Helen, son? -Helen is fine. -Well you haven't seen her in quite a while. Don't be stingy with her. Ella says come on, dinner's ready! Ella's going to take me to prayer meeting some Wednesday night. -If you behave yourself and don't shout. -What a treat. -Prayer meeting never hurt anyone. -Hm. It's a nice change from pictures every night. -Can I pray out loud if I want to? -Eat your dinner. -Sophia? -That's not my name. -Aren't you getting just a wee bit plump? What do you say, children? Shouldn't we begin to diet Mother? -Joseph. -Well it's not a sin for a mother of five to keep her figure these days, you know. All in the line of duty, now. -I've got no time to be bothering. -Well, it's just a suggestion. But wouldn't you bet that Arthur's Helen takes time off to bother. Nice girl, Helen. By the way, has the date been set yet? -No, not yet. -Well I don't sometimes catch up with these things but after they're over. I don't want to miss out on the first family wedding, that's all. I'd hate to come home some night and find the bathroom full of wedding gown. -Marjorie! What are you doing? -Well, everybody was so quiet, I thought I'd say something. -Well, your conversation is a little over our heads, darling. What's the matter? Is there anything wrong with me? Am I eating my soup a little too conversationally? Well, what's new? Isn't anybody broadcasting tonight? -I went to the five-and-ten with Lucy and we saw some beads and Ella said-- -Eat your dinner, Marjorie. -Whew. Aren't there-- -Must you all talk at once? -Well I didn't. -Eat your dinner. -Looks as if you've all lost your tongues. -Well, I didn't. You ain't even touched yours. -Well, I haven't lost my appetite, Ella. -So I see. -Why Arthur, don't you like your chicken? -Oh yes, sure. -Well you children are not eating either. Don't you feel well? -Sure. -Ella says when people don't eat it's a sign they're in love. -Marjorie. -Helen said she'd be over this evening, by the way. -Well, it's high time she came over. Mm, 7:30. -What, no dessert again, Joseph? -Well I must diet if you don't. -What do you care at your age. -My age? I like that. I was young as ever. -You're telling us. -I don't care for any dessert Mother, thanks. Excuse me. I want pie. I want a big piece. Don't be greedy. -Can we go the pictures tonight? -We'll see. -Ah gee, Mommy. -Oh Ella? -Yes Ma'am? -There's a piece of pie for Mr. White. What is going on here tonight? -Nothing, Mom. -May I be excused too, please, Mom? -Yes. -Excuse me. Cherry pie anymore. -Can't we do something to stop Dad from going? We must do something. -Wait a minute. Hello, Dad. -Hello, son. -Say Dad, must you go to lodge tonight? -Huh? -Do you have to? -Well I-- I'm afraid so, son. -We could play bridge if you'd stay. We're all of us here, and it'd be nice. Everybody's home tonight. It'd be nice if you'd stay. -Well I'm sorry, son. If you had said something about it earlier. -Oh. All right, Dad. I just thought it-- Dad, your shoelace is undone. -Oh yes, so it is. -Let me tie it. -Thanks. It's a funny thing, Fred. You know I hardly know you boys. A minute ago you were little kids, and here you are-- well what are you, anyhow? A man already or a boy? Damned if I know. Well I think we ought to get acquainted and find out. -Well, sure thing, Dad. Let's. And if you stay tonight, it'd be a good time to begin. Wouldn't it? -Well I-- I'm sorry, Fred, but we'll make it tomorrow night though, huh? -Say, Pop. You're a whizz at puzzles See if you can do this. I bet you can. It's got me. -I haven't time now, Dave. -Aw come on, just a minute. -Well it's pretty late to work on one of these crazy things. -Ah, go on Dad. Please give it a try. Once you get started on one of these things, it's-- -Dad can do it if anybody can. I guess that's why we let him do everything around the house. I guess Dad it's because you fix furnaces better than anybody else. Eh, Daddy? Go on, try it for him. -I didn't know I had such a good reputation. It's embarrassing. Suppose I can't do it? -Well sit down for it at least. That would help. -Joseph, what are you doing there? -He's working a puzzle for Dick. -Well you'd better stop putting those puzzles if you want to get to your lodge tonight. -Oh Mom, leave him alone, will you? -What is it, dear? -Oh nothing Dad, only every time we try to do anything, somebody interrupts. -There. That's where I got it, then I lost the darn thing. Now, which way do you-- You asked us to dinner for you. -Oh Mom, leave him alone, can't you? -Why, what is it dear? Marjorie, don't put such a big piece in your mouth. -Yeah. -Don't let us down now, Dad. I'm afraid you boasted a little too soon. -I know you can do it Dad, if you just keep at it. -Well, steady. Now, now, don't rattle me. There it is. Well. Well, I guess I just about saved my reputation. -I wish you could stay, Dad. We could have some fun. -I can't, Fred. If I'd known about it. -Oh gee, Dad. Can't ya? -I'm sorry, Nick. -Dad, I want to have a talk with you. -Well, some other time, Arthur. I'm late now. -Perhaps it might be better if-- -Hello, Joseph. -Why, hello Alice. -Well? Aren't you going to ask me in? -Why yes, of course. Do come in. I can only stay a moment. I'm leaving tonight for New York, and catching the for Paris. Think of it, Joseph, Paris. Why hello there! Young lady, do you know that you left your purse at my house on Thusrday night? -My purse? -Yes. Oh, did you know that I met the children? Well I did, when their car was stalled in front of my house. And I couldn't leave the Nell Gwyn and two hobs of an elephant to freeze to death on Maple Avenue, to say nothing of a knight in armor. So I invited them in from the cold, and we had coffee and sandwiches, and made quite a good start at getting acquainted. Little knowing, of course, that they were your children. Oh-- -Oh Sophie. This is my wife, Alice. -How do you do? -How do you do. -Sophie, this is Alice Vail, an old friend. -An old friend indeed, Mrs. White. Your husband used to be my boss long ago. -Oh yes? -Well do come in and sit down. -I can only stay a moment. I'm taking the plane tonight, and I still have a million things to do. I was just explaining how I met your young people the other evening, the night they were stalled. And I only found out after they'd gone who they were. I suppose it was very stupid of me not to ask, but as I think it over, I guess it was because I did all the talking. You know, sometimes we'll say things and tell things to strangers that we wouldn't if we knew each other. I guess it was the night or the open fire. And then I found out that your oldest boy and that nice girl were engaged. And that set me off. I told them all about myself. And among other things, that I'd been in love all my life. But I forgot to tell them one thing. The most important thing. That the man wasn't in love with me. And that I shouldn't ever want him to find out that I was in love with him. It would destroy a beautiful friendship and might cause unhappiness to others. Now that I look at your , I wonder how I ever failed to recognize him as Joseph's son. He looks just like him when he was young, don't you think so? -Yes. I always say that Arthur takes after his father's side of the family. -I'd love to stay a little longer, but I'm afraid I must run along. Did you all get home all right? -Yes we did, thanks. -The coffee helped. -Oh it did? I'm glad of that. -It was very kind of you. I'm sorry that I can't have them all over again, sometime. -Good evening. Oh, how do you do? -Hello. -I'm so glad of the chance to offer you my good wishes again. -Thank you. -Oh yes. And you too, lucky young man. Send me an invitation to your wedding, will you? I'd like to send your bride something nice from Paris. Goodbye, Mrs. White. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, twins. -Goodbye. Goodbye. -Goodbye my dear. -Goodbye. -Oh, your purse. -That isn't mine. -Oh no? But your card was in it? -That's mine, I think. I must have had one of your cards, Janet. -Goodbye. -Thanks. -And thank you for everything. -I'll see you to your car. -Oh thanks. -A very nice person. What's her name? I didn't quite catch it. -It's Ms. Vail I think, Mother. -Well I believe your father's going to be late for his precious lodge, after all. It'll be the first time in years if he is. -Mommy, aren't we going to the pictures tonight? -I guess so. -Goody! -Go along and get ready. -Well? -She said he never loved her. She's going away. -That's why she came, I guess. So we wouldn't spill it. -Of course that's why. -First, I was going to telephone and tell you not to come. Then Helen called me, and told me that the children were hurting. I was afraid that they might do something. Something that couldn't be undone. So I thought it best to come here and clear it all up, frankly. Helen gave me her purse as a pretext. And, well, you know the rest. -But you-- you told them I didn't love you. -That was my only lie. Don't you see, dear? It can't go on. If those children had been what I first thought they were, it might have been different. But they are fine, splendid children. I almost feel jealous they're not mine. They need you. They've got to have a father that they can be proud of, not one that they have to make excuses for every Thursday night. -You're really not going to Paris? -Yes. -You don't have a job there. -That was a lie, too. I'm running away again, Joseph. -I can't let you go. -It isn't easy for me either, dear. I've loved you for a long time. Long before you ever knew. We haven't seen much of each other, you and I. But it has meant everything to me. -Then why are you going? -Because you belong to them. I sometimes wish that we should. Wouldn't they, Joseph? -Alice. -Don't make it too hard, dear. Just say goodbye. Goodbye, Joseph. -Have a good time, Mom. -Oh thank you, dear. Joseph? You didn't go to your lodge after all? -No. No, I didn't go. -Would you like to go to the pictures with us? -Why yes, I'd like to. If you'd like to have me. -Well of course we'd like to have you. -Joseph, what do you think Janet just asked me? -Don't know. -She was looking at that old picture of you. And she asked me if I still loved you. And she talked a lot of foolishness about things. -Things? -Oh love and romance. About it's flying out of the window. It made me think. Joseph, you know I haven't changed, don't you? Not really, I mean. Of course, when you've been married a number of years, I suppose there is a change, outwardly. But not really, Joseph.
