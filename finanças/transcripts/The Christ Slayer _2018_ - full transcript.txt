- [Man] And what do they call you? - [Boy] Mostly boy. And what do they call you? (thunder rumbling) - [Man] Fate. (boy yelling) (hammer pounding) (fly buzzing) (calm music) (man whispering) - Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. - I think you've partaken in enough vine. Away with you. - I am a Son of thunder. His thunder! - Ugh. (dramatic music) (groaning) - I cannot tell if he's drunk or mad. Maybe both. - Smell their breath next time. It never lies. - Again you slept with the door open. (groaning) - Why must you scurry about so loudly? - Perhaps to make a point. Anybody could have pilfered or worse in here? - Yeah, well I'm not dead. Is the kingdom sacked and looted? - Sadly I can't tell. What happened once I left you at the garden? (groaning) - [Longinus] That's right. I think I tried to cook. - Take in this beautiful morning. - Why? - It lets light inside. - No, it only allows those thieves you worry about to peer inside freely. - Perhaps. I brought you your favorite bread. It's fresh. - And wine? - Later at the market. - What am I supposed to wash this bread down with? - Squeezed grape. - Squeezed grapes? - Think of it as wine that is very, very weak. That stains. - What did you say? - Nothing. I'm preparing your gear. - My gear? What for? - Training this afternoon. You have midday training. - Training? Why? - A required day of training for all centurion. - Why was I not told about this? - I told you about this every day for the past three mornings. - And I'm obligated to attend? - Yes. - A blind centurion? I should not be made to go. - Your father would demand it. - If not for his status I'd be in no such position. - It's our good fortune your father does hold status. You earn a wage instead of having to beg like all the other blind people. You are blessed. (calm music) (groaning) - Getting slow, Crispus. - Quick enough to best you. (metal clanging) (grunting) - Who's the better swordsman, Longinus? - It sounds even. - You're supposed to say me, you blind fool. Vitus the great. - Even blind he knows. I've always been better with blades. (grunting) A centurion always remains focused on the task at hand. Sharon will not accept your excuses. - I can best you with a spear. - Unfortunate for you that's not what we're training you today. - A centurion is versed in all weapons. - You feel confident, centurion telling another soldier how to do battle? Draw your sword. - You proved your point. - I don't think I have. Now draw your sword. Defend yourself, centurion. That is an order. I will resume the rite of decemadio upon you, you coward! (grunting) - He's had enough, Vitus. - I outrank you, Crispus. I will decide when he has had enough. - I'm fine. - Again. Again! (grunting) The one and all. He who does battle with us, he who sheds his blood with us, let it be known that this blind fool represents us all. He should be able to defend himself. He should want to be like us, be one of us. We are only as strong as our weakest link, and Longinus, you are our weakest link. (grunting) - Less talk! - I see. I speak the truth. One accidental swing of my sword and I can remove that weak link. (grunting) Your status was not earned like ours. You rode in on your father's horse. (groaning) If this were Sparta, you would've been cast out. (grunting) - He's had enough! - Get off me! (groaning) I'm gonna remove the weakest link! (groaning) - You will face his father's wrath. - Disgrace. - Wine. I require more wine. Wine! I require more wine. Wine. I require wine! (groaning) - No wine for you. You've been assigned to crowd duty under my command for this afternoon's crucifixion. (coughing) Give a blind man a spear and maybe the crowd will fear him. Not likely. (groaning) (heavy breathing) - [Man] Raise him! (somber music) - This is your moment, my son. Remember what you have learned in your weakness. (man whispering) - Bleed him! Longinus. Perhaps you can strike a target that isn't moving. - I'd rather not. - That was an order not a request. Bleed him. Closer. Closer! Now. Now. (muffled screaming) (thunder rumbling) (grunts) - [Longinus] I take great, great satisfaction in knowing that in the end I will be right there. I will be looking in your eyes. - Then darkness just fell and the rock shook of anger. Odd day. - I don't find the darkness odd anymore. But the ground shaking as if Hades was opening his gates. I tell you that was odd. - Yeah, but the ground moved just as the false prophet was dying. - You're acting it out? - Yes. - You know I cannot see you. Okay, so moving rocks, darkness. What are you proposing, that he wasn't a false prophet? - Of course he was. Let the followers enjoy their sabbath. Their messiah is dead. - Many today do not believe him to be false. - Fanatics. - They say he will rise from the dead on the third day. - The only thing that's gonna be rising is a putrid smell from that tomb. Nobody returns from across the River Styx. - That's what they would have you believe. - You still have blood on you. - Cease with your mothering! - Speaking of mothers, it was a sight today. - Shall I remind you again that I lack sight? - His mother was at his feet. - His mother should have persuaded him to pursue his talents elsewhere. - Vitus was cruel. He should not have commanded you as he did. - To have me poking blindly at some poor soul. I could barely fulfill my duty. Perhaps he's right. - He's right? - A blind centurion? That would be like a mute singer or a legless dancer. I'm sure many have thought what Vitus has there to say. Have you ever spoken such things about me, Crispus? - Not in your presence. He's here. - I can smell his fancy man oils. - Were the events of this glorious day not enough for either of you two today? - What's that fine beauty that stands next to you, Vitus? I can smell her flowery scent from here. - This fine beauty, 'tis pity you can't see her. I stand before you as a flower attracting busy little bees, while you two sit in your wretched filth, attracting pesky little flies. - Do you always have to be so rude? - Do you always have to be so sensible? - You're welcome. - Those Christ followers, they weep as they put his body into the tomb. Centurion guards standing outside far too respectful if you ask me. Gone are the glory days where they would just feed his scraps to the dogs. - Well, things have thankfully changed. He will be forgotten as soon as the next so-called Messiah arise. - Ah, but until that day, Crispus, let us play on the fame of this world. Attention, everyone. Attention! The prophet they call Christ was put to death today. Let us honor the man that delivered that death strike with his almighty centurion spear, behold, the Christ slayer! - [All] Christ slayer! - I would gladly take the death spear. - I cannot. That belongs to the centurion. - Let us talk. You can start by buying me some water. (faint chatter in distance) (sighs) - May I sit with you, slayer of Christ? - Don't call me that. - Everyone is calling you that. - Well, you're not everyone. Sit. But, I don't get wages until next week. - This night is for me. (exotic music) (gasps) (ominous music) (panting) (screaming) (panting) - What sits so heavily upon your sicking mind? - A lion. A lion was approaching me while I slept. - Could you see in this dream? - No. Well, it pounds my head. (grunts) - My brave centurion bested by a hot drink. I like taking care of you. - A novelty on occasion but not as a duty, I assure you. - The wine was flowing freely last night. Everyone wanted to buy the hero a drink. - Me? No. I'm no hero. - Last night, you could have fooled me. - Allow me to share. - I will make another. - No, I insist, take a sip. Do you not trust a blind man? - I trust you very much. (gasps) What are you doing? - [Longinus] What? (shouts) - What's wrong? - You. You, I behold you. - Are you sure? - Yes. I remembered sight. - Can you see now? - No. No. I did. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. - How can this be? - I don't know, but I saw you. Beautiful you. - Your word, the sweetest thing anyone's ever say to me. (Longinus grunts) - What brings you here in your day of rest? - [Albus] That's what I told him. - Silence, boy. - I've been trying to stay awake all day. - I can feel those once. - I am not going to throw my lot in the fanatics. - [Longinus] What happened? - Today, people have come in droves to pay their respects and pray. They look at me. I believe we've acted in error. - We followed orders. - And we will be judged for that. - We'll be judged for all of our actions. - I fear for you. - Boy, take me home. - Beg his forgiveness. If he is who he says he was, I can't imagine what lies ahead for you. - [Longinus] I appreciate your concern. (calm music) I can feel the sun fading. - Can you see anything? - No. - Too sabbaths have been celebrated. One ends at sunset. - You would think that with this Jesus dead that some of these activities would cease. - I think with everything that happened he'll be more powerful in death than in life. - Perhaps. - You are part of that. - I don't wish to be. - You can't change that now. I'm done here Do you need anything else? - No. Go enjoy your evening. Be gone with you, boy. - I will return in the morning with a fresh bread and wine. (ominous music) (grunts) (shouting and crying in distance) - Not again, no. (growling in distance) (shouts) (knocking on the door) (grunts) - Oh, Albus. Since when did you start knocking? And since when have you started wearing perfumed oils? - Good morning. - Who is this? - Mary, mother of the one they called Jesus of Nazareth. May I come in? - Yeah, yes, please. - Thank you for saving me. - It's quite unexpected as you can imagine. - You are truly blind. - Yes, I am. I'm sorry, I cannot offer you anything. My boy hasn't dropped off this morning's bread. - I only want a moment of your time. - I'm terribly uncomfortable. - It is because you feel. You ended my son's suffering. - I did what I was ordered to do. - You had compassion etched upon your face. Why do you tremble? - I've never, I never felt this much. - Guilt. - Perhaps. - Listen to me. I forgive you and I know He would also forgive you. - (grunts) How can you say that? - It was all meant to happen. I was pleased it was you. - Hey, why is the door, oh. Oh, I didn't know you had company. - I must be going. We are preparing to anoint His body today. Follow your heart. You are a good man. Peace be with you. - Who was that? - That was Mary, mother of Christ. - What does she want? - She came to forgive me. - Really? - She was happy. She was happy I was the one that killed her son. - I've heard talk they may be giving you a promotion. - I'll be leaving the legion. - Did you hear what I've just said? You'll be given a higher position and wage. - I shall dictate a letter and you shall put it forth. - I beg you to think about this action. - Fetch me parchment and ink. Quick! (upbeat music) - It was decided you should see this. If you wish to reply. (grunting) - [Mary] You are a good man. - No! - [Mary] I forgive you. And I know He would also forgive you. (shouts) (dramatic music) - Tear my soul like a lion, dragging me away, while there is none to deliver. - [Mary] Pity for he has never known the love of a mother. (knocking on the door) - Father? - May I enter? - Yes. (calm music) - I'm sure you know why I'm here. - [Longinus] I could wager. - I can shout instructions to a thousand men, but I cannot find the right words for my only son. - I understand. You've done all that you could have done for me. - An honorary centurion status was not easy to arrange given your-- - I know. And I do appreciate all that you have done for me. Perhaps you'd like a seat or something to drink? - No. No, I'd rather stand. - Father, this is not for me. It is time for me to move on. My weakness has nothing to do with you. - I should never have left you in the care of those magi all those years ago. - No, they were great teachers. This was not Master Malkira's fault nor is it yours. - Where will you go, what will you do? I worry about you. I will not always be here. - I will be going home. - Home? - Yes. Mother. - How will you travel? - Don't worry, I had a good father who taught me how to survive. - My son, the Christ slayer. - Another undeserving title. - It's the talk of the court. Perhaps with this fame now might be an ideal time for you to step down from service. - You understand? - I do understand and I can tell that you have made up your mind. And like your father, there's no change in that. - Thank you. - I'm so proud of you. I love you beyond words. Go. Go find happiness wherever that might be. - Till we meet again, father. - A few more years I have before me, after I'll likely join you at home. Say hello to your mother for me. I miss her greatly. (door closes) - [Albus] (sighs) A peaceful day. - [Longinus] The water relaxes me. (birds chirping in distance) - I want to talk with you about something. - All right, speak your mind. - I think what you offer me is generous, but what if I wanna go with you? - I cannot ask that of you. Not your people. You'd be an outcast. - I am an orphan. You're my only people. I would go where you go. - You'd have more opportunities here. - My best opportunity for happiness is with you. You journey will be much easier with me. You're blind. - I shall consider it, Albus. - [Man] The Christ slayer! (wind gusting) - Why? Why? Why would the one true God? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why would the one true God allow for His offspring to be born onto this world as a man, huh? Why? Why me? (shouts) (grunts) That's what I thought. (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (Longinus shouting) - I think the price that you have offered to me is fair. - If you say so. - The proceeds minus our services to be dispersed in equal parts to the three parts. - Perfect. - May I ask of you something? - Surely. - Jesus of Nazareth, do you know of Him? - No, did you? - Once. He forgives you. - You've asked for my mark. - But of course. - There. - This is a new beginning for you. - Thank you for your time. - Peace be with you. - And to you. Thank you. (door closes) Interesting. - Is it? - Longinus. - Crispus? What brings you here so early? - Have you had any visitors? - [Longinus] Yes, we have, why? - You have. And? - Have you've been partaking in wine so early? - No. Well, yes, hours ago, but not now. - You're not making any sense. - Your visitor, Felix. - Who? - The Messiah. - She was here too. - She? - Yes, the mother of the so-called Messiah. Is this what this is all about? - The followers of Jesus told everybody that once in tomb, three days and three nights, He would rise from the dead. - She said nothing about this. - He's gone. - Who? - Jesus from the tomb. Women came to perform some Jewish ritual and then they move the rock, Jesus was gone. We are trying to say His followers stole the body, but. - That's not what happened. - No. Beware. If this Jesus has truly risen, He may seek revenge. (dramatic music) - [Albus] (whispering) Longinus! Longinus! (groans) - I feel eyes upon me. - They surely are. - Keep your looks! - Crispus is here. - Why does everyone has issue? - If I didn't know better, I say they're afraid. - Afraid of what? - Perhaps this Jesus. Perhaps retribution by His followers. - I've had all I can take of this place. We leave tonight. Tomorrow, I want to wake up anyplace but here. Are you coming? (ominous music) (Longinus gasping) - Well, is it the wine? - Did it happen again? - What's going on with me? - Blessing! Someone said they have the curse of the Christ. - The what? - Drunk babble from fearful minds. - First they hailed me as Christ slayer, and now the accused one of the inflicted Christ's curse? Another reason for me to leave. - It's true? You're leaving? - Yes. And what would you want me to do? Stay? For what? (somber music) This man, Felix, he's going to give you gift. - A gift? Your friendship is the best gift to me. - You've made it easy for me. Goodbye, Leah. (Leah sobbing) Is this my? - Yes. Find happiness. You look after him. - I'll do my very best. You're good for him. - [Longinus] Albus! - He really leaving. - Yes. - Perhaps that is best. Come, let me be your new friend. (somber music) (dramatic music) - When you say we are leaving in haste, you meant it? - I cannot stand another moment in that cesspool. - And Leah? - Leah, a beautiful flower in a field of dung. - Very poetic. - I spit in her eye. Wine me. (sighs) That lion will not make me its plaything tonight. - Huh? I could have sworn you had your sight as we left. - I did. - I knew it will happen. - I'm not sure. My sight came once that quickly. - But that's twice, right? - Yes. - It sounds more like a blessing than a curse. - Perhaps we have good travels ahead of us, Albus. (Longinus grunts) (man laughing) - Your coin, all of it! - Away, thief. - [Man] Leave the boy alone. - Someone is a dead man. (dramatic music) - [Jesus] Forgive any quarrel that we have upon this day. - How? I don't. Forgive me. - You'll ask, so you are. (runs crying) - [Longinus] Did he fled? - [Albus] Your reputation likely saved us. - The spear. He most likely recognized I was formerly... - A Christ Slayer! I think he recognized you and this man also kindly helped us. - Keep running! - Yeah! - Many thanks for your good deeds. And to whom do we owe the appreciation to? - I would not attempt to lie to a centurion, but I also do not wish to reveal myself. My help does not require a recognition. - How did you know I was a centurion? - Your marks of legion and the centurion spear. Any holes in you, young man? - No more than a scratch. Thanks to you. - Do you travel towards Alexandria? - Near. We'll be avoiding the city. - Perhaps for safety, we could travel together. - Again, that is up to the centurion. - I'm no longer a centurion. I wish to leave that life behind. And if we are to give each other false names, you should call me Cleopas. - Very well, Cleopas. - I want a name. Titus. - Titus? Sure. And yours? - Call me John. - Gift of God, I like it. - John. Are you an outlaw? - To some. No longer. - [Albus] Cleopas, Titus and John, three outlaws walking on the road to endless. (dramatic music) (thunder crackling) - Why has he not left? - Only he knows. (lightning crackles) - Upon His awakening, He spoke to his womb mother and to His followers why does He remain. The kingdom awaits. - He'll depart for the kingdom when He deems Himself ready. - I told you, life as a man was not for Him. - And He want the experience. - To suffer and be reduced by specs. He should have gone elsewhere and started a new garden. - It's brutal indeed. It's difficult to watch and do nothing. I'm pleased He's returning. - Ungrateful creations, these mortals. Already they sing and beg of His return. I would think after His reception here, He would leave mankind to their own. - He has a deep love for them. - (chuckles) Love? What is love when it's not returned, Gabriel? Weakness. - Is it? - Is love devotion? Is love loyalty? Is love a willingness to sacrifice life for another? Complex as these beings are, they have not the delicate grace found in the field of flowers. No divine scent that lingers and a sweet breeze after a rain. No warmth or breath taking brilliance from the sun setting over the bluest of waters. I have seen beauty and mankind is not beautiful. (thunder rolls) - It's not in our hearts. Not in His ways. Perhaps His time here on earth has set in motion certain changes. - Wishful thinking, old friend. They will kill one another to claim His words. Words they will further pervert and distort to serve the agendas of the ambitious, ambitious men seeking power. They will perform countless sins against one another while building their walls around what they see if they needed to be. - Sounds familiar. Justification for their sinful actions. - When mankind has all but turn to dust, beauty and peace will reign again. (ominous music) (calm music) - [Jesus] You did not sleep. - How did you do? - Speak your mind through me. - I don't care what you do to me. But I can't have you harming the boy. - You got the only weapon here. - Sharp walking stick in the hands of a blind man? - Looks dangerous enough. - Have you ever seen a centurion spear up close? - Once or twice. - Symbol of our unified strength. - Yes, but how much sorrow and suffering has it brought? - It's brought much peace and order into a lawless land. - How much peace and order has it brought you? (snores) (farts) - Forgive me, I've overslept. - There in lies our new found freedom, Albus. - It's Titus. Now he know it's my real name. - Titus, we are late for nothing. Simply here now. - Good to see you here, John. - Where would I be? - Someone thought you'd be gone by morning with everything you could steal. - (chuckles) Really? - I owe you on that one. It's a good wager, outlaw. Wouldn't use your real name. I have to say that it surprised me a bit. - Mankind is so trusting. - We've earned that reputation. - I'm gonna suggest that we travel off the road to the Port of Cyrene. - Interesting. - [Albus] No Alexandria? City second only to Rome? - [Longinus] No cities. - [Jesus] Are you able to travel the wilderness? - Listen to your words. I was once a soldier. Marching was part of my everyday life. I can handle the wilderness. The question is, can you? - I'll try. - It could be days. - I'll survive. - Say that I haven't warned you. What about navigation? - That's a lot of faith that you're putting in me. - You have such an honest face, John. (Jesus laughs) - I life off the road. No thieves and no murderers. - But the wilderness is so much better. Lions, bears. - Is there an animal more dangerous than man? - I hope not. I feel like we're being watched. - We're always being watched. Do I travel with too much haste? - [Longinus] Your pace does not hinder us. - Beautiful. - [Albus] The desert? - [Jesus] All of it. - [Albus] Have you seen much of it? - [Jesus] Fortunately yes. - [Albus] I wish to see more. - Glorious sights to behold are all around us. - I'm not one to complain about my circumstances, but I cannot behold anything. - [Albus] Perhaps water would serve you better here? - [Longinus] Away from me, boy! - [Albus] I wanted to assist you. You didn't sleep. You must be exhausted. - Boy, you still treat me like a frail flower. I'm not weak! - [Albus] Even the strong fall sometimes. - Curse you, boy! Let me fall. My whole life has been a fall! (thunder rumbling in the distance) - It's hard to let those that you love fall or fail. But look where your anger has taken you. - I saw you! - It happened again? - Just for a moment, but I saw you, John. - Like the father I never had. That's how I love you. I would never accept your unkind words. I know your heart. - Strike me! - It is forgiven. - No, you would make me feel much better. I insist. - Best to just appease him when he's like this. - Strike me! (grunting) - [Jesus] I truly do wish to hear your thoughts on this man Jesus. - [Longinus] I believe this Jesus, if divinely sent, brought about change much too quickly. People are not ready. - [Jesus] Will they ever be ready? - For what? - Invitation to return to the kingdom of the Father? - Fear of some final fiery eternal death and damnation will have many believe that they are ready. I hope he's a god of forgiveness and mercy. - Why? - 'Cause we're not worthy. If worthy is ready, no one will ever be. - [Jesus] Perhaps his sacrifice can atone for the shortcomings of mankind? - [Longinus] Yes, but why? Why live a ruthless despicable life only to find forgiveness at the very end? Is that the way, his way? - [Jesus] They ask for forgiveness. I'm sure that it would be given. - You think his death is such a good thing? I don't believe it to be so. A Messiah ministry is surely to grow like a child without guidance. - Will they hunt us down? - Surely not. - John, how can you say that with any certainty? One can go about preaching about love and peace for those worse to fall upon hateful hearts. - Your faith in mankind is heavily tainted. - Tainted by truth, my friend. Mark my words. Many will die in His name and many more will kill in His name. And is that what He intended? What will they make of His words a thousand years from now? What will become of his original teachings? - Quite worth considering. (calm music) - Peace be with you on this night. - Peace be with you. - We're told this vessel can make it to Anaxeme? - You heard correct. - Will you take payment for your services? - Always. How many passengers? - Three. - I thought you had to part ways here? - After hearing of such a beautiful place, I must see it myself. - We'll pay half now and half upon arrival. What's your name? Old Salt is what we were given. - I've gone by many names, sir. You can call me Salt. The Old part is not so attractive. - Very well. I'm Cleopas. This is Titus and John. - I see. We're all known by many names. The boat is stocked and prepared to depart if that's what you wish. - I'm exhausted. Let us be off. - Agreed. Welcome aboard. My darkest corners and sideways shadows are illuminated by your luminous light. Get yourself settled and we'll get this voyage underway. - The lion will no longer torment him. Do not miss love. You know the power of it. - I think you are the one way to His truth. Enlightening him to love as they experience it. The Almighty was very decisive in the early days of creation. He commanded from a place of great strength and was easily displeased. He was quick to destroy deviation, to create anew, but to him it was only rebirth. You died for their sins and His impossible standard. Was it painful? Death? Say it. - What words do you wish to hear? - Declare I was right. Man is an unpredictable creature. - No. Man is always predictable to be unpredictable. - Made in his image. - As are you. - [Salt] Let me tell you a tale I heard from a Greek sailor. Zeus, favored son of the Titans, thrice been fooled by Prometheus. Zeus demanded impossible sacrifice made from each man. Prometheus refused. - [Jesus] And how did Zeus react? - [Salt] He ordered Prometheus dragged to the distant mountains, chained in a dark place where pain was inflicted daily. What angered Zeus more was that Prometheus would not speak the mother's name whose child would dethrone Zeus. You wanna know the name? - Of whom? - The mother whose son would dethrone Zeus? Mary. Her name is Mary. You're the child to dethrone God with your newly acquired insights. - No. I will sit in honor beside Him. The throne does not empower my Father. My Father empowers the throne. (water gently lapping) (Longinus groaning) - Albus? - The sun of a new day welcomes us. - Where are we? - Where's the boat? - Gone. We've arrived. - How? - You were exhausted and slept. Now you're here. Shall we get you home? I saw a path not far from here. - [Albus] What lies your family home? - If you travel west, before the village, look for the date trees. - Who resides there? - Sabina. My father's sister. - Will she be filled with joy to see you after all these years? - Joy? As I remember she was joyous to all. An overflowing bowl of sunshine. - An overflowing bowl of sunshine sounds exactly like what you need. (calm music) - Hold right there. Who approaches? - Bowl of sunshine? - It's me. It's Longinus. - Hadrian's boy? - One and the same. Is that you, Sabina? - Forgive me! (calm music) These eyes aren't what they once were. - That makes the two of us. - I so wish I could've helped you. - The best have tried. - Come, come. - Are you gonna tell her? - Mind your tongue and manners, we just arrived. - And who is this handsome man? - Titus. And this is John. - Welcome, John. Titus. - Titus is too formal. Why don't you address me as Albus? - Welcome, Albus. - [Jesus] Thank you for your kindness. - Well, let's get you all cleaned up. Who's hungry? I am. - Come this way. - Your dwelling is so peaceful. - Yours to enjoy. He told you how we're blood. - Your brother is his father. - Yes. - He's a great man. A great warrior. - (chuckles) Is he now? - Mm-hmm. He's met the Emperor. - Did he grew up here? - The early years. When his father was assigned, he was sent off. - [Albus] Where? - Our grandfather is a part of a priestly order to the east. He was sent there for keeping and education. - Is she putting you to sleep with our entire family history? - Stop. I'm proud of our history. I have cleaned clothes for bed. If you follow me. - Wait until she finds out the Christ Slayer is part of our proud family history. - Does it fit? I wish you all could've met him. Daniel. A hearty laugh. The best smile and a heart like a bear. - Those are fond memories. - He now dwells in a better place. - Surely he does. What would you have me do with these? - To me. Go eat. Go. - They're healthy. - Popular amongst the village and beyond. - Beautiful creation. - Keep up, boy. - How do you pass your days here? - Well, I tend to the dates. I also treat the sick and help bring new life into our world occasionally. - There's something special about that journey. - Each mother brings something divine to mankind, just as your mother did with you. - With me? How's that? - Hope. Hope for a better tomorrow is the greatest gift. - Do you want me to come with you? - He goes to visit his mother. - Come on. (calm music) (calm music) (sobbing) - The boy's resting? - [Jesus] It's been a long journey. - John, washing your clothes, they're badly stained with blood. - My name is not John. It's Jesus. - And my intuition is correct. - You are knowing. - You're the son of God recently executed in Jerusalem. Said to have been reborn. - And so I am. - Did being born a man give you no insight? - How could it not? - I recommend experiencing life as a woman. We're different. - (chuckles) That's being kind. - Man, afraid of losing, treat you so poorly. For that I am truly sorry. - Yes. But many men showed me love and kindness. - Hold on to that. Don't give up on us. - Don't give up on what? - You're back. I was starting to worry. - How does it feel to be home? - Different. Does the market still operate? - At this time only the wine garden is open. - [Longinus] Perfect. - Don't you wish to rest? - I have plenty of days to rest. I wish to go. Same direction? - Yes. - I will travel with him. - Bless you. Some feel they must walk alone. - Does not have to be so. - And yet men often choose that very path. (calm music) - [Jesus] You move swiftly for a man without sight. - [Longinus] Longing for wine will do that to a man. Does Luna sit in the sky? - [Jesus] Oh yes. A beautiful manifestation of God's glory. - You sound passionate. - I try. - You no longer feel this way? - So why did you leave your position? - The centurions? - Yes. - I no longer felt I was making a difference. So I left. - Wherever you go I shall follow. - Oh, Albus. - You were scared, I saw you. But you didn't see me 'cause you're blind. (men laughing) (ethnic music) - This used to be a quiet little place. - Everything changes. Oh, that's our table. - Almost feels like our place back-- - Home. - That place is no longer our home, Albus. Never again. - Will you be eating? - Eating, yes, we'll be eating food. But not yet, but not now. We'll be eating cheese and bread and-- - And wine. - And water, please. - Lots of wine. - Won't you share a nectar of the grape with me, John? - Perhaps. - Can I help you? - Probably not. Just curious where you acquired a spear of such craftsmanship. - The spear's not for sale. - You think I wanna purchase it? - I do not know what you're looking to do. - Thank you. - You wish to break bread with us? - [Albus] What's your name? - Gaius. I'm the census. I protect this village. - Now you're doing a very good job from what I can see. I feel safer already. - That depends on what you're here for. - Wine. Is the girl here? - Yes, I'm here. - Wine, please. (chuckles) - You're blind. - Observant. Two unknowns solved by Gaius, the all-knowing. - Don't. - Are you mocking me? - No. - Are you mocking me? - I believe I might be. - I do not understand the reasoning behind your approach. Are you an admirer of crafted metals? A bully to the blind? What do you seek to gain here? - What do I see? - We have traveled a long distance and all we wish to do is break bread in peace. - Yeah. - So let us cease this exchange until you have truly something worthy to say. Let us pray. Our Father in heaven... (loud thudding) His kingdom come. His will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. - He's gone. I thought we were gonna be troubled. - There's only one troubled person here at this table. - Here we are, fresh red wine. Would you like to sample our cheeses? - I sure would. I'll pick something up for all of us. - You may leave the wine. Thank you. (grunts) - More. - [Jesus] A salute. - I have nothing on my mind. - To going home. - To going home. (grunts) - You really should try to enjoy your days here. She would want that. - How do you know about her? - Your mother? She loved you very much and she still does. - Some days... I can see her face. And other days... - That would not rid you of your pain. - But it puts it in the stable for a while. What makes you think you knew how she felt? - I have a mother. I know. I put her through a lot. (calm music) - I just want her to touch me. Feel me. Speak to me. If she cannot come here then I shall go to her. I came here to-- - Pass. To embrace the ocean. To end it. - Yes. - It's not your time. - Hey, John! John, look. Cheese and bread. Together! It smells so good, it's a miracle. - Smells heavenly. - Is everything all right? - Everything is as it should be. Sit. - The sun looks like mithra rising from the trees. - A thousand ways they tried to put order to that which they do not understand. Always they look outside versus inside. They worship the creation but not the creator. I lived life as they do now. Still do not think I fully understood it. - I was accepted into His graces before your name was ever known. Many of us held deep relationships to and with the One God. Those after us started to move away from the glorifying of the Creator's primal forces. Man started to create their own gods to justify their mortal vices. - A relationship of lies. But I have brought the truth. Salvation is within reach of all. - But they must want to be saved. (calm music) - And what do they call you? - Fate. - You are a good man. I trust you. - [Jesus] Call me John. - [Longinus] I will be looking. I saw you! - [Jesus] To embrace the ocean. To end it. (echoing) To end it. - How long were you planning on staying there? - All day, if I had to. - We need to discuss something. First, you save us on the road, good Samaritan and all, I get that. But I know when a man has an agenda. What's yours? - I used to think that I knew. - I know that feeling. I'd sacrifice myself, here and now, if I thought I had chance even to change us to one thing for the better. - Sacrifice is not required. You will see your mother again, in the kingdom of our Father. - She didn't follow the path of the true Messiah. I've lost her. - You believe him to be the true Messiah? - I believe you to be the true Messiah. - As she does now. For upon death, the heart can say what the tongue never did. Rest assured, brother Longinus, your mother does reside in the kingdom of my Father. - You've risen? I'm not the Christ Slayer. - Yes, you are. This garden of life is but one of many. This wondrous world and the stars beyond await discovery. Seek and they will find the processes of creation and destruction are openly displayed to anybody who wants to observe and study. - But men are more concerned about waging wars and laying claims to land that nobody owns. Being blind inflicts one to question everything that cannot be seen. And it forces us to rely on faith. - Your lack of distractions has given you clarity and wisdom. - But what are you doing here? With me? - I thought I was here helping you but I think you're also here helping me. - I spoke with your mother. - (chuckles) Yes, she likes you. - But I killed you. - She overlooks that. She was a good student and a greater teacher. - I can't believe that you're the son of the one true living God. - There was a day when you were very excited about finding me. - Master Malkira. I remember chasing the star. - I know their order very well. - After that encounter I was under Sabina's care until I finally went back to my father. - [Jesus] A desperate play in a greater game. Believe in me and he will no longer have domain over you. - And what do I owe you for this freedom? - Love. Love yourself. Love others. Love me. Love to the Father. Nothing more is required. (calm music) I want you to come and follow my voice. I want you to be reborn. - I can do that. - Come. (calm music) (water sloshing) (birds singing) - I can see! I can see! (thunder rumbling) - [Sabina] You've come to say goodbye. - [Jesus] Will their hearts and their minds ever be worthy? - [Sabina] We can always reach out in love and hold on to hope. - [Jesus] But will they ever truly be ready? - [Sabina] One day the sun above will sleep and our kind will take a final name and bid goodnight to the heavens. - [Jesus] Was it a mistake to allow free will? - [Sabina] It was the right thing. You'd be in your right to leave us and never return. - [Jesus] I considered it. I knew that words would not be enough. I thought that actions would speak loudest. - [Sabina] To some they do. - [Jesus] Yes. But now it's time for me to go home. - [Sabina] Peace be with you. - [Jesus] Peace be with you. (thunder rumbling) - Sabina! Sabina! - What is it? (laughs) - I can see. God has blessed me! (calm music) A new start! (thunder rumbling in the distance) Albus? - It'd be good for him. - You'll take care of him. - I will do my very best. - How? How? - I prayed on it. I prayed. - [Gabriel] Is your journey complete? - [Jesus] I have one more task for you. - [Gabriel] I do not understand. Are you not eager to return to the kingdom? - [Albus] You're welcome. (all laughing) (faint voices talking) - [Leah] Albus stood right by me. I had a guide the whole way. - [Gabriel] Is it finished, my Lord? - [Jesus] It's just begun. - [Gabriel] Come, let us return to the kingdom. (calm music) (calm music) (serene music)
