We're going to need an ambulance. They're on the way. No... You got to get him, you got to get him on his side so he can breathe right. - Where'd you learn that? - Uh, Campfire Girls, uh... I... I don't remember. What is he, epileptic? Uh, yeah. I think. Are you sure? Could be drugs. - Drugs? - Yeah. Now, this guy don't look like a drug addict to me. - No. - What is it? - Epilepsy. - Epilepsy. Yeah. He's epileptic. Uh, uh... Why doesn't everybody go back to their tables? He's fine, really. The ambulance is coming. He's... Thank you. Thanks. Thanks for cooperating. Free coffee for everyone. Cora, why don't you just... Give everybody... Free coffee! Nick's gonna to kill you. Yeah. You can make that phone call now, Jorge. - Your name is Frankie, right? - Yeah. - I'm Johnny. - Yeah. I know. Frankie and Johnny, the song. Yeah. I've, I've heard of it. - Is, is he breathing all right? - Yeah. "Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts." - Are you... Are you sure? - Is that a coincidence? - I don't think he's breathing right. - He's breathing, yes. Why don't you go out with me tonight? What? I'm asking you out with me tonight, on a date. He just asked her out. - I don't believe this. - What's hard to believe? - I really want to go out with you, that's all... - No. Keep him company. I'll go wait for the ambulance. Oh... Oh! Hey, chum, welcome to the world. What happened? Nothing much. I just got turned down by some woman. No, you're going to be fine. Hey, Lucy. Oh! I'm actually in Rego Park. Look who's here. Look who's here. What's he doing here? He didn't even know her. Sure, he did. His first day was her last, I think. Helen can use all the mourners she can get. - Nedda! - I didn't mean it unkindly. I'm just glad we didn't book St. Patrick's. Tino and Luther were here earlier. - Nick sprung big for the flowers. - They're nice. - I got to go. - I think I'm going to go with you. Yeah, funerals give me the willies. - You're gonna come or what? - We just got here. It's the thought. I don't want to leave her alone. Yeah. Sure. Come on, Nedda. We don't need a brick wall to fall on us. Shut up. Don't be ridiculous. You're picking up a guy in a funeral parlor in front of a frickin' stiff! In my wildest dreams, I didn't do anything like that. Oh, blow it out your ass! Charming. Sorry, Helen. Tino, who do I have to fuck to get a waffle? Forget about the waffle. Thank you, Tino. Oscar's a lot better. Hot plates. Look out. Here's another present for you, Luther. Can I ask you something? Oh, yeah. Shoot. Oh, Tino. Give me a moment here. Thank you. I'll clean that later. Did you know Helen? I mean, it looked like you were crying today. Death is very sad. But you didn't even know her. Well, you don't have to know someone to feel sad for them. They call it empathy. Yeah. - Empathy. Yeah. - Empathy... The sympathetic vibrations of two human beings... - No, yeah. I know what empathy means. - No, you don't know what it means. That's okay. I didn't know what it means either till I looked it up. See, every day when I'm shaving, I look up a new word. There was a little piece of turkey, that's all. How can you empathy with someone you've never met? I didn't have to meet her, you see. I just looked at her picture on the casket, and I knew. I knew she lived alone. I knew she had these dreams that weren't quite enough to keep her heart beating, So she kept... she kept it going by putting a bottle of four roses under her pillow every night, nobody knew about. Vodka. You know, you should get yourself a crystal ball and one of those turbans. You'd make a lot more money than you do here. Oh, no, I'm no fortuneteller. I just tell it the way I see it. She had that look, you know? My mother had that look her whole life while she was alive. Disappointed. I need a blood sausage and hash browns. Nedda, what are you doing? She was just asking me out. I am not asking... I am not asking you out. Oh, I'm sorry I'm interrupting. And you know what? You're slicing the turkey too thin. Oh, that's okay. I'll wait. Baby, you know how I feel about you, right? Hey, don't monopolize the phone. Oh, thank you, Cora. Did you come? I'm sorry. I usually can hold it longer than that. Sorry. But it didn't seem like you came. I came. I did. Oh, it was terrific. Are you sure? Are you kidding? Of course I... I did. Yeah, but... Usually, a guy will moan, or yell or something. You didn't even clear your throat. I trained myself to do it quietly. Why? Well, let's just say I've been in places where a full-throated orgasm would be highly inappropriate. What do you mean, like a monastery? Yeah, sorta. Hmm. I'm dizzy. Ooh. Maybe the... Maybe the shoes was too much for you. Oh, could have been. Or position maybe? Oh, position. Yes. Oh. I like that position. Woman astride. Oh, yes. Yeah, well, why didn't you say something? I would have done it. You... you did it. That's what this is. Astride. What, on top? Yeah. On top, like this. Oh. Oh, Cora... Though my lips were sealed... My mind and my body were just shooting off fireworks. Oh, yeah? Ah, so it wasn't exactly perfect. Don't worry about it. I wasn't exactly 100%. These shoes, they're cute, but they kill my feet. Can I stay over? No. Why not? Because, if you stay over, the two of us are just gonna lie here, all night, awake. Pretending to be asleep, and wondering why we didn't hit it off. That's why. Johnny, you're just lonely. I'm just lonely. We don't have to be Romeo and Juliet. Lonely. Yeah. You got a boyfriend, you said. Got two boyfriends. I'm looking for one Mr. Right. I'll see you tomorrow. See you at the salt mines. Bye. Good night. Johnny? It's not the end of the world. Oh, I know. I've seen the end of the world. "But look, "the morn, in russet mantle clad, "Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill." "The morn", see? What the hell does it mean? It means the son-of-a-bitch sun is up. Why doesn't this dickhead just say so, instead of all this "russet mantle" bullshit? Because he's William Shakespeare, Jorge, the greatest poet that ever lived. So, what're you tellin' me, you don't respect me anymore? Oh, I could care less. I don't respect you anymore. Who asked you? I think you're both a couple of tramps. Look, I did you both a favor. I tried him out. Did he really... - Oh... - Two minutes... - Tops. - Oh, I hate that. And so quiet, like a mouse. I mean, Marcel Marceau comes louder than this guy. Yeah, maybe you scared him, you know. I mean, that isn't out of the question. Well, maybe so, but I don't read poetry. And as I see it, you need two words to make it in this town. Fuck, and you. Somebody didn't get laid last night. What are you talking about? I get laid every night. Oh, I bet you do. Yeah. Opa. Opa! No. Not the wig. No, I knew not to use the wig. But you know those gold pumps I got? The stilettos? So, I put them on. Things are looking good, but then I... I know what you two are talking about. You do? Of course I do. What are we talking about, Nedda? Come on. Say the word. - Say the word. Oh, - Come on, leave her alone. - One time. - Cut it out. Just for me. Come on. C-c-copulate. Say it. Cora, leave her alone! Once in your life. - Set yourself free. - You are so mean. Come on, you can do it! On the count of three. One, two, three! I watch Dr. Ruth. Peter, telephone. Yeah. Uh-huh. How much? Whoo-hoo!

I'm supposed to say that. Yeah, but you never do. ♪ Frankie and Johnny... Oh, my god. I look like the Breck girl! Oh, hi. - This is 6-A, right? - 6-A. Welcome. Hello. - Are you... - Oh, my god! You okay? Whoo! - Can I get you something? - Oh, I'm fine. I just ran up five flights. I don't know what got into me. I just had to run up. Wanted to get here, I guess. You didn't have to do that. Oh, no, it was my pleasure. My pleasure. So, are you ready? - Yes, she is. - Yeah, almost. Good. Nice apartment. Big for a studio. Okay, sit. I guess there's, uh, not an empty chair in the house, huh? Oh... Um... Oh, man. I couldn't figure out what to wear, either. Uh, this is Tim and Bobby. They're, uh, hooking up my VCR. Oh, great. Whew! I'm Tim. He's Bobby. I live across the hall, and, uh, Bobby lives with the von Trapp family. So I guess this is your first date. Yeah. We just started dating, ourselves. Each other? Yes. Oh, that's interesting. You'd never know it, you know? That's, uh... So, this is really, uh, nice and homey, isn't it? Oh, elephants. Oh, yeah. She's been collecting those since she was a kid. When the trunks are up, it's supposed to mean good luck. Yeah, it does, but they got to face the window. Oh. Otherwise, it's bad luck. I read that somewhere. That explains a lot. Uh, I think I could help you with that wire there. I think I got it. If I could just... You sure you know what you're doing? The last time I worked on one of these... OK, yeah, I think that one goes right there. Yeah, no, I'm sure. Okay. Johnny, are you an electrician? Uh, no, I'm a cook. This is so exciting. I feel like your big sister. Well, what do you think? He's... nice. Oh, that's a rotten thing to say. He's very nice. Look, we've both done worse. Of course, he could be a mass murderer or a psycho. You never know these days. Thank you for sharing that with me. Come on, you look great. Hurry up before he changes his mind. I think it's better the way I had it. Yeah, I think you're right. Maybe I should just learn to leave well enough alone. Oh. Let me help you. Here. Try this. You know, I have a cousin who's gay, by the way. Oh. Most people do. Um, ready? He's really a great guy. I'm sure. You know he just found out he was gay a couple of months ago. Well, I'll look him up in the directory. Under the new listings. Let's go. Good one. Nice meeting you, huh? Nice meeting you, Bobby. Um, sorry about the TV. That's OK. Don't worry about it. Nice meeting you. Sure you don't want to come? Next week, we'll double. Okay. Bye. Oh, I hope it works out. There's a lot of reasons. For instance, at work, all the little things you do that I watch. I love the way you swig. You don't think we fit, do you? We fit, Frankie. We fit. Like... Peas in a pod. Like a lock and a key. I'm not so sure I like where your key's been. You mean Cora, right? Okay. You think that was something, huh? Come on. You know what that was. It was a band-aid on loneliness. So, how old are you? None of your business. How old are you? What do you think? Late forties. Oh. Oh, no. God. What? Then... then don't ask. Don't ask. But before I go any further, I'd like to introduce you all to my heart, Cheryl. Cheryl! The man this couldn't have happened without, my agent, Mutzie Kalish. Mutzie! And finally, to all of you who helped me when I was a nobody. I'd like to thank you all now, because I'm sure I will forget you when I'm big and in Hollywood. I have something to say. Okay. I wish to make salute to Peter, who used to work for me at the Apollo Cafe, 23rd and 9th. In honor of Peter, my cousins will play some Greek music. Yeah, let's break some plates. Would you like some cake? So, want to dance? No. No. No. Ask Nedda. That's her thing. Nedda? I mean, if something happens between us, I hope you're not going to... - You can handle it. - I'll deal with it. Nedda? What? Would you like to go Greek with me? Oh, yeah. Hang on a second, though. My bra snapped. For old times' sake. Aah! Ow! Me and three of the guys tightened that up. Hey, Johnny! Johnny's teaching me how to be a cook. This is Maria. Great party. Confession time. On my first day, I stole some of your tips. I know, but you put it back the next day. I was broke. I was really broke. I'm really glad things are working out for you, Peter, you know? I wish you all the best. Thanks. - Come on. Let's get something to eat. - Hey, baby, let's cut a rug. Are you braless? Let's go, Niko! Come on, dance! All right, let's go! It's not Greek, but it's good. Party! Party! Johnny! Let's go, johnny! Hey, latest step! Yes, bravo, bravo. - Come on. There must be a reason. - Dumbo. - Dumbo? The movie? - Yep. No deep hidden meaning. - No... - Plain Dumbo the elephant. Just before my father left when I was seven, he took me to see Dumbo. And I liked the movie, so I save elephants. I like that movie, too. The flower market. It's my secret place. Only me and 3,000 florists know about it. Hey, how about a lovely corsage for the lady? Oh, good. Which one? Uh, the one on the bottom. The third one in. - This one? - Yeah. Okay, I got it. You want me to do it? You never went to the prom, did you? No. Did you? I wish you'd stop looking at me like that. Like what? Like that. It's too intense. You don't look. You stare. It makes me nervous. Oh, thank god you finally got here. Sorry I'm late. Get off my back! I... I think we should go to your place. I think so. Johnny, I... I really like you, but does it have to be tonight? Yeah. Who says? Frankie... I may not make it till tomorrow. Aah! Oh, oh, oh. I'm okay. Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. You got something? - You mean rubbers? - Yeah. Oh, talk about a mood changer. - Well, do you? - Oh! The truth is that I didn't think this was going to happen on a first date. I just didn't think this was... Well, the truth is, it's not going to. - Oh, no. - It's okay. I don't know, you know? I just... I was thinking if I had brought something, what would that look like? That would look like I was planning to do it with you. - Wouldn't it? - No, it's okay. It's okay. Maybe this is just not such a good idea anyway. Oh, come on. Now, this is... I'm being penalized for respecting you. You're not being penalized. You're just not getting laid. Wait a minute. Now, is this... Is this about getting laid? - All right, let's just talk. - No, come on. How about... How about I make us a sandwich? - You want a sandwich? - A sandwich. I hate wearing God damn rubbers. Pardon my French, but I know you got to do it. I never thought I would even contemplate sleeping with a man who said "Pardon my French" all the time. Well... Done. Finished. I will never say those words again. I mean, where do you pick up an expression like that? - This is good. Mmm. - Mmm? - You made this? - No, my Mom... Ow! Shit. - Let me see that. - It's all right. - It's all right. - I'll get you something. Just keep pressure on it. I'm gonna get something. Don't let any blood spill on the meat loaf. Look, I don't think this is going to work out. I can't hear what you're saying! I'm a BLT down sort of person, and I think you are looking for someone a little more... pheasant under glass. What are you doing in there? Nothing. I'm just looking for Band-Aids. What are you doing? Come on in. Sit down. First Aid. Give me your finger. Give me your thumb. Okay... Mmm! I'm 42. I'm 32. Really? You don't look it. I'm 44. Honest? I'll be 46 this year. What do you want for your birthday? I want to stop bullshitting about things like my age. I'll be 35 on the 11th of November. - You're a Scorpio. - Mmm-hmm. Look in the medicine cabinet. I... I have some. I didn't want you to get the wrong impression. - They're behind the blue box. - I got 'em. Is it on? Well, not yet, you know. You can't just put it on until it's... No, I know. You know, I wouldn't have gotten the wrong impression. Let me hear you. I want to hear you. Come on, baby. Let it go. Let it go! Come on. Let it go. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on. - Ahhh! Ohhh! Ah! I need eggs over easy and a roast chicken. ♪ It must be love It must be love ♪ You wear bandanna. I wear bandanna. The baby's coming soon? You know what it is yet? Yeah, twin boys. - Twins you got? - Yeah. - Can I touch? - Oh, yeah. Be my guest. I think this one just kicked the other one. Cora, I never see you like this. People think I'm a tough bitch, but it ain't true. Shit like this chokes me up. Frankie! - Come here. Touch the babies. - Ah, no, that's okay. My hands are dirty. Um, next time. Yeah, this is your last chance, Frankie. I am never getting pregnant again. Oh, sure. That's what you said last time. Flora, honey, no. The blue. Remember? The blue is for the morning, and then the red one is for the evening. - Thank you, Frankie. - You're welcome. You're welcome. Eggs over easy twice, scramble three with nova. Hello to you, too. I see you made it home all right. Oh, yes. I made it here this morning. - I had time enough to put this together. - Nice. I slept like a babe. So, I saw you talking over here. You like kids? - They're okay. - You know, you look like someone who likes kids. - Oh, yeah? - Mmm-hmm. So did my father. What does somebody who likes kids look like? I need an order of liver and onions... Captain Ahab. Hey, thanks for loaning me the car, Nick. He's lending me his car. I got an errand to run. He's lending you his car? He likes my cooking. How about we take a little walk? I think we should. Look, I got to eat. We all got to eat. We'll eat. How about I make a little picnic for us? What's the menu? Whatever you like, you know. You like tuna fish? Tino tells me you like tuna fish. I'll make tuna casserole. Oh, no, not casserole. No. Tuna fish sandwich. I am defined by my tuna sandwich. I take the tuna out of the can, and I work it between my fingers until it gets real soft. I'm back. It is kind of scary. You got to admit, two people coming together is scary. But, you know, you can't deny that it's happening. You know how I feel? I'll tell you how I really feel. I feel like you're too needy for me. - Oh, come on. What's that? What does that mean? - It means... I feel like you want everything that I am, you know? Yes, I do. Why not? Nick tells me guys ask you out and you just keep saying no. Why is that? - I'm retired from dating. - What does that mean? Something happen to you when you were a kid? What happened? No. Why is it that anytime a woman doesn't want to get involved in a relationship, men think it's because they were messed with as a kid? Wrong. They were messed with as a woman. I'm not going to mess with you. You like my tuna? Yeah. It's good. So you didn't graduate high school. So what? - So you can go back. - Go back? - Yeah. - No, I don't think so. No. I had one highlight in high school. One. What was that? I played Sister Sarah in our production of Guys and Dolls. No kidding? Frankie and Johnny. Yeah. I've heard the song. We were a couple before we met. Didn't they end up killing each other? No, she killed him. You got the edge there. Come on, let's go. Yes! Yes, yes. Go ahead. So, what are you doing tonight? Bowling. It's my bowling night. Bowling? Great. I love bowling. No, no, no. It's a league and besides, you have your errand. - After my errand. - No. Johnny, I need a night to get over you. I mean, last night... Okay, so I'm on meadowbrook. Fourteen... Meadowbrook... Meadowbrook... Where's 111? Where is 111? Oh, Meadowbrook. Am I close? Here it is. - Let's bowl. - Okay. Okay, now, concentrate, Cora. All right, Cora! Yes. Bring 'em in. Here we go, Frankie. Here we go. We need this spare, honey. She knows how to roll spares. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Yes! Oh, hell. Great, Nedda. Great? It was terrible. It was better than last time. Wow! Did you see that? Hey, where'd you learn to bowl like that? Altoona, PA. That's about all I learned there. Hi. You're from Altoona? Yeah. I... I think I'm going to have some kind of fit. I... I was born in Altoona. - Very funny. Very funny. He makes things up. - No, are you kidding? No! I was born in St. Stephen's hospital. We lived on Martell Street. And I suppose you went to Moody High School, too. No, I didn't go to Moody High School because we left when I was eight years old. I went to Park Lane elementary, though. Are you really from Altoona? Well, why would anyone pretend they were from Altoona? So they could keep up this cockamamie coincidence theory. Don't encourage him. Listen, my mother ran off with a guy she met at an AA meeting. My father took us to Baltimore, to his sister, my aunt. Cora, it's your turn. No. This is better than Old Yeller. Go on. She couldn't cope with us, so they put us in foster homes. Now I'm 18 years old, and I'm with the carnival. This guy Mr. Memory, he's 85 years old. He's got a memory, instant recall, so he's got things in his head. He's got entire books in his head, - Palindromes, speeches... - What's that? Palindromes, um, something you can spell backwards and forwards the same way. - You know, like... - Madam. - Otto. - Boob. B-O-O-B. Puppy. Close enough. Anyway, the old guy says to me, "Johnny..." Are we bowling or what? Sorry. Shall we bowl? That's why he has such a good memory. Tell him he can't bowl in those shoes. Hey, what is the matter with him? Okay, I'm going to use my own little ball here. Come on, Frankie! She's not on my side. How you doing? Okay. - You all right? - Mmm-hmm. I know I wasn't supposed to come here tonight. I don't know how you feel about me coming here. - It's okay. - It's okay? Yeah. Babe? Yeah. Frankie, you're up. Okay, we need a strike. They're ahead by four. What are you talking about, they're ahead? Let me look at this. That's 92 and 8 is a hundred. It's not 96. No, no. That was a happy face I drew. If you're going to doctor somebody's scores, doctor mine. Okay, okay. I'm going all over the place with you. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talking about this. I'm in love with you. I love you. I am totally, completely mad for you. My heart stops every time I look at you. Personally, I think we should be married. I definitely want to have kids. Four or five, if possible. There, I said it. Wasn't so difficult. You don't have to say anything. It's fine with me. I just wanted to get it out, myself. Talk about a load off. Talk about a load off? Talk about a crock of shit. Aw, don't say that, Frankie. That's vulgar talk. That's not like you. You don't talk like that. Fuck you how I talk. I'll talk any fucking way I fucking feel like it. This is my fucking bowling night. Who the fuck are you to fucking spoil it by fucking telling me you love me? She really likes this guy. I told you I love you, that makes me unlovable. No. It makes you a creep. No, you're not a creep. You're sincere. That's what's so awful! I mean, are you nuts? Kids, for Christ's sake! So what's wrong with kids? I hate kids! - I don't believe that. - Okay, I'm too old to have kids. No, you're not. I can't have any. Are you happy now? We'll adopt. Look, you don't just decide to go falling in love with people, out of the blue. - Why not? - They don't like it! Do you need help? How would you like it if Nedda came up to you and she said, "I love you and I want to have your baby"? Nedda, I really like you. You're a nice person. But I love Frankie. I'm getting help. You don't know me. I can't do anything. I slept with the guy. You slept with him? Frankie didn't tell you that? She told me you slept with everybody else, not him. She didn't tell you about the gold pumps? He wore gold pumps? You just want to believe that just because that makes it easier for you to keep running away. You don't know me. I don't know you. I know you. What do you want, Frankie? What do you want? What do you want from a guy? I want a guy who will love me no matter what. You got him. Here. Me. Christ, this is worse than Looking for Mr. Goodbar. Frankie, I am trying to improve my life, that's all. And I'm running out of time. Maybe you should just go find someone else who's double-parked like you. That could happen, you know. I could meet somebody tomorrow, Get laid, think I was in love with her. - Why not? - Hey, don't let me stop you. You're not stopping me. I'm stopping me. I love you! But I'm so scared, Frankie. I'm so scared you're going to retreat back. You know, to that place you're so comfortable with. That place where nobody can find you. That's why I'm coming on so strong. Can't you see it? What's going on here? Frankie, chances like this don't come along often. You got to take them because if you don't, they're gone forever. And you may wind up not only, and pardon my French for the very last time, screwing some other person you meet, thinking you're in love with this person, and marrying them. It happens. Okay, Johnny, that's enough. You're making her cry. Boy, are you barking up the wrong tree. You know, I never thought that I could fall in love with a woman who said, "Barking up the wrong tree." Let's go. You've driven me to it! All right. Let's calm down, shall we? You wait outside. Are you all right? I never use that expression. Ever! If I wanted a man in my life, I wouldn't have bought a VCR I can't even work. Excuse me. Um... I live in the building across from you, and, uh... I've seen how he beats you. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what you're talking about. Shit! Excuse me. Don't be afraid. Let me help you. Thanks, mister. I can't take it anymore. This is not fair. You're not going to give up your job because of this guy. You were there first. I'll handle him. Now what's the problem? He says he's in love with me. He wants to marry me. That bastard! He's talking about a family. Boy, you can pick 'em. Love, a home, marriage. Screw that shit. Can I answer this? Tell him to go to hell. Frankie just said something very derogatory about you, but I know at least a dozen women and quite a few men I can put you in touch with. Johnny, give it a rest. She doesn't want to talk. He wants to know about tonight. Saturday night. The loneliest night of the week. I'm busy. Call me in a few years. He's singing. ♪ Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week ♪ Johnny, I got to go. We're expecting another call from you any minute. Now remember, you're new here, so you're easy to fire. Okay now, keep things clean. Over here we have the ice for the drinks. Remember that. Here is the telephone. Don't use it. I like your ponytail. You don't write scripts or something like that. All dishes go here, okay? Okay, over here all waitresses put dirty dishes here, okay? You keep clean. Frankie, you're going to kill me. I just got here. Why? Many people changing shifts. This makes me dizzy. It's not my fault, okay? You had tonight off. So did you. Yeah, well, something came up. Something came up for me, too. Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, okay? I really don't, but, you know, Nick doesn't like the help messing around. You know, so please don't make this any more difficult than it has to be. I really need this job. You think I would jeopardize your job? I would never jeopardize your job. I'd quit before I do that, and I mean that, and I need this job, too. Okay, all right. Well, then let's just both go about our business. I need a chicken sand, and it's birthday time at table eight. This is brand-new cashier, and she's my grandmother. Now you give her check when you finish, okay? ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow Have good time. ♪ Which nobody can deny Happy birthday, Uncle Lou. - You look great. - Blow. Blow it out. Watch yourself. Thank you. A grilled cheese and an order of skins. I got a little carried away at the bowling alley. You know, my errand didn't turn out too good. So, I just want you to know I'm sorry. I apologize. Well, you certainly made an impression. You want something to drink? I'm on a break, too, so... Talk, don't talk. It's up to you. Are you keeping some big secret from me? - Like what? - Like, I don't know. Like, you tell me. Uh... I'm not married. Were you? Yes. - How many times? - Once. That it? Were you in jail? Yes. Served 18 months in the slammer. What for? Signing somebody else's name to somebody else's check. A forger? Well, I'd call it a failed forger. I mean, I just did it once. I was... Is that where you did all your reading, prison? Yeah, most of it. I got most of my books from a fella named Henry Hank Hill. I don't know him. Nobody did. He was executed two months ago. I cooked him his last meal. Andreas, this lettuce is limp. I'm sorry. You're right. - I'm going to the john, Frankie. - Okay. So, how about you? Were you ever married? No. Uh, chef's salad, chicken salad, and a side of slaw. Anyone serious? Try terminal. Who's this serious person? Who is that? Uh, well, he got more serious with who I thought was my best friend. Oh, really? How long ago was that? Three years. I was divorced three years ago. Now, is that a coincidence? Really? I cross my heart and hope to die. - Waitress! - I'll be right with you, ma'am. You got any kids? Two. I thought so. You see them? Yesterday. First time in two years. - Yeah? - That's what the errand was about. My wife remarried. She lives in the suburbs now. I hate the suburbs. No, it's not bad. Beautiful house. Nice. I could have never provided them with anything like that. So I got there. There were my kids, playing on the lawn. I bet they were glad to see you, huh. Well, I didn't get out of the car. I just couldn't, uh... They looked so happy, you know. They got so big. They... Looked like somebody else's kids, so... I just drove away. It's like I lost them, you know? That's how I feel. Waitress! Hello! Can we get some service? No, you haven't lost them. You're just not ready. Finally. What's safe to eat here? I'm sorry. We're closed. What? What kind of a place is this? Okay, hurry up. Let's go. Good night, Frankie. - Good night, Andreas. - Good night, Ari. Here's yours, Frankie. You can come back here any Saturday night. Thanks, Maxine. - Good night, Maxine. - Good night. - Was she home? - Yeah. - Did you talk to her? - Yeah. What did she say? I'm going to see the kids next weekend. Good. Thank you. What is that? It's a rose. It grew in the kitchen. Okay, good night. Closing up. Everything finished. Okay, is good. What's that? It's a potato. It's a rose. Johnny made it. On my break. It's nice. That potato. Very romantic. Okay, Frankie, you want lift home? It's okay. Thanks. Okay, you know how to close up. Huh? Bring back fork. - Good night. - Good night, Nick. Good night. Come on, grandma. We go home, watch wrestling. Come. Come on. I'll walk you home. So, how about you? Do you ever want to kill yourself sometime? Uh... well, yeah. Everybody wants to kill themselves sometime. Can we change the subject? Okay. Want me to buy you that? Yeah. If you had any wish, what would you wish to be? You won't laugh? No. Teacher. You know, teaching little kids. That's good. What about you? I mean did you always dream of being a cook? No. Prison did it. When I went in and I heard that clank, you know, boom. I died. Then they put me in the kitchen with the food, and, I don't know, suddenly I was born again. I started to feel like I could breathe again. You know, it was like I had aspirations. Aspiration? - Aspiration, yeah. - Have you been shaving again? So what about this terminal relationship you had with this guy? What was that? The guy who left you for your best friend? Phillip? You know, the main thing I felt was? Dumb. I even introduced them. I lent them money. I gave her my old television. They're probably watching it together at this very moment. I hope it explodes and blows their faces off. What about before Phillip? Anybody else? I don't want to talk about that. Okay, but you can't spend the night. Aw! You know, I know there's got to be something in this world better than watching you do that, but I'll be damned if I know what it is. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, sure. No, I put it up there, it's a vision. It's inspired spectacle. I put it up there with the Grand Canyon, a mother nursing her child, triumphant facts of nature. You been to the Grand Canyon? I have not, no. Yeah. Me either. I'd like to go there someday. Hawaii, too. Open your robe. No. I don't want to open my robe. Why? I don't know. I just want to look at you. No. Fifteen seconds. That's all. I just want to look at... Look at what? Why? I don't know. I just... To know that I can... That I can look at the woman I love and just see her, her eyes, her breasts, her stomach. Don't say it. - I wasn't going to. - I hate that word, Johnny. Well, I hate both of them. Okay, I'll look up some new ones in my thesaurus. I never know when you're playing games or being serious. I am doing both. Serious games. Look, why do we have to name everything? Say you had a pet parakeet, right? It was beautiful. I'd want to look at it. You'd let me look at it, and we'd be on to the next thing. I had a parakeet. I hated it. I was glad when it died. Okay. Fifteen seconds. I'm timing this. Turn that light out. I told my cousin I didn't want a bird. She swore I'd love a parakeet. What's to love? They don't do anything except not sing when you want them to and sing when you don't. Make that awful scratching noise on the bottom of the cage. If I ever get another pet, it'll be a dog. You know, something you can hold. The only time I got my hands on that god damn parakeet was the day it dropped dead and I had to pick it up and throw it in the garbage can. Okay, that's enough. That's got to be 15 seconds. Happy now? That music is nice. Makes me think of grace. You're listening to Midnight with Marlon. For information on becoming a supporting member of the WMYL family, why not give me a call? 5-5-5-1-1-1-1. What do you want to kill yourself about sometimes? I want to kill myself sometimes when I think that I'm the only person in the world and that part of me that feels that way is trapped inside this body that only bumps into other bodies without ever connecting to the only other person in the world trapped inside of them. We have to connect. We just have to. I feel... Very... Sad? No. I don't know what it is. - Say it. Say it anyway. - No. Protective. Good. That's very nice. No. I'm looking for somebody to take care of me this time. Aren't we all? Why do we keep going from one subject I don't like to another? What is this? All of a sudden, the armor's up. What about your armor? - I don't have any. - Besides. I wasn't talking about you. Not everybody thinks life is a picnic, Johnny. Some of us have problems. Some of us have sorrows. But people like you are so busy telling us what you want, how you feel, you don't even notice the rest of us who aren't exactly jumping up and down singing Yankee Doodle Dandy. Hold it. How are we getting into this stuff. What are you talking about? I've done nothing but notice you. You don't notice me. You smother me. I am not gonna give up everything again for somebody I don't know and doesn't know me. I can't keep repeating the same stupidity in my life. Who's saying you give up anything? We're talking about love here. We're talking about need and things like that. We're not in love. Maybe that's what you think. I think we are. Just because you've given up on that possibility, there's no need to drag me down to that kind of level of thinking. I think you better leave now. You know, I'm sorry. I thought you were a kindred spirit. You know what kindred means? Two of a kind, sharing a great affinity. I know what kindred means. Shall we go for affinity? You know... That is the first really rotten thing you've said to me. To make fun of somebody else's intelligence or education or lack of, that is somebody I would be very glad not to know. I thought you were sad, Johnny. I thought you were weird. I didn't know you were cruel. - I'm sorry. - It's just a cruelty just waiting to happen again. And I don't want to be there when it does. Just get out. I want you to go. Why do you want me to go? I mean really. Why do you want me to... I want to be alone. I want to watch my VCR. I want to eat ice cream. I want to go to sleep. Aw, come on, alone. Jeez! Sooner or later, you're going to have to deal with us. I mean, that's it. There's just no two ways about it. Why don't we get it over with now? You're in the mood. Come on. Tomorrow's Sunday. Day off. We'll sleep in. Let's talk. All right, I'm calling Tim. No, Bobby. He's bigger. He'll beat the shit out of you. Not yet. Not yet. All I have to is open up that window and scream. Are you kidding. In this city? Everybody's doing the same thing. Who's going to hear you? Get out! Okay. Okay. I promise I will go. Only, I want to make a call. You know, this all should be so easy. Why is it always so damn hard? Hello, uh, Midnight with Marlon? Oh. Hello, uh, Marlon. My name is, uh, Johnny, and I would like to know the name of that particular piece of piano music you were just playing a minute ago. So I can go out and buy the record, present it to my lady love, whose name happens to be Frankie. And is that not a coincidence? Frankie and Johnny. Debussy. Claude Debussy. Right. Clair de lune. You got that? Why are you doing this? Everything I want is in this room. Uh, hello, uh, Marlon. Yeah, I know you don't take requests, but could you just listen to me a second? Now, there's a man and a woman. He's a cook. She's a waitress. Now, they meet, and they don't connect, only, she noticed him. He could feel it. And he noticed her. And they both knew it was going to happen. They made love and for maybe one whole night, they forgot the ten million things that make people think, "I don't love this person, "I don't like this person, I don't know this..." Instead, it was perfect, and they were perfect, and that's all there was to know about. Only, now she's beginning to forget all that, and who knows pretty soon he's going to forget it, too, so I was just wondering could you play an encore for Frankie and Johnny in the hope of something that ought to last and not self-destruct? Well, why don't you just think about it? Okay. Thank you. I want to show you something. That guy I didn't want to talk about, he did this with a belt buckle. It's gone. It'll never go. It's gone. I made it go. No, Johnny. You can't make it go away. Nobody can. He's the reason I can't have... Kids. Um... He knocked me around when I was pregnant, and, um... I lost the baby. And there were complications. He's gone now. I would never hit you. Never. You don't have to be afraid anymore. I am. I'm afraid. I'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid not to be alone. I'm afraid of what I am, what I'm not, what I might become, what I might never become. I don't want to stay at my job for the rest of my life, but I... I'm afraid to leave. And I'm just tired, you know? I'm just so tired of being afraid. Aw, honey. Honey, listen to me. I know I can't make the bad go away. You're right. I can't. But, when the bad comes again, I'm going to be next to you. I can't, Johnny. I'm sorry. This is WMYL in New York, and you're listening to Midnight with Marlon. As you know, it's not my policy to take requests, but there's always an exception to the rule. I don't know if this is the most beautiful song ever written, Frankie and Johnny. Oh, how I wish that really were your names, but I know when my leg's being pulled. God, how I wish you two really existed. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd still like to believe in love. Why the hell do you think I work these hours? Anyway, you two moonbeams, whoever and wherever you are, whatever you're doing, this one's for you. Here's an encore. You want to brush? That means you want me to brush. Take the blue one. It's never been used. I'm not going to ask you whose robe this is. Good. You should get toothpaste with fluoride. Shh. Listen. No matter what?
