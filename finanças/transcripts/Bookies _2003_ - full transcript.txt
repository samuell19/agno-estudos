[Music] [Overlapping chatter] [Announcer] ...To change the way this ball club is playing. This was a good time out. Kingston state just can't seem to get things going. They're playing listlessly. Have no emotion on the floor. Seem to have nothing on the ball at all. Preston university playing out of their minds while Kingston is sleeping. Are we gonna be okay? [Announcer] ...Gonna change the look of the club on the floor now. The only clue is-- [toby] Five baskets. Ten points. $100,000. Is this gonna be okay? Who the hell knows? This time, we were beyond shit's creek. And if I had a question right now, it would be, "where's the map?" How did I get to this place? [Rock music] ♪♪ [Whistles] [Stammers] Uh, Tammy. I've got a family thing I really need to take care of. Can you cover the rest of my shift? Eat me. I'll take your Friday morning shift. Please. And next Saturday. Fine. Fuck. Fine. Excuse me. Pardon me. Hey. Afternoon, lady. You wanna meet up later? No? I'm working. Hey. What's up? What's up? What's up? I really prefer not to watch. Come on, you fuckin' piece of shit. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Have some lunch, case. [Jude] Come on. Here we go. We can do this. It's a big game, boys. What did we get in at? Spread is six and a half. A half point? This is stupid. Why don't they just say seven? Seven has to win by eight. Is there even an eight in football? Go. Go. Go. Drink. Asshole. Don't fuckin' jinx us. It's a beer and a bag of funyuns before kickoff. [Announcer] ...Power behind their 4-1 start. Tampa set to kick off. Their kicker, second-year man Scott channing. Here's the kick. And receiving... [Jude] All right. Perfect. [Jude] And they're off. Here we go. [Toby] We were always serious about our bets. But this one was special. A thousand bucks. We each pitched in enough for the pot. The winnings were going straight to a blowout trip to Vegas. Fuck. [Announcer] Actually made at about the 42-yard-line. An amazing pickup-- [toby] Jude Petra. My roommate and best friend since the 7th grade. We rushed every frat. They snubbed us cold. Jude thanked them by pissing in their Ferrari gas tanks. I can't watch this. Hey. Hey. Hey. [Toby] Casey young. Smart as fuck. We found him lost in the dorm on the first day of school, so jude adopted him as our social science project. [Announcer] Now, buffalo needs to get the running game going-- with a wobbly blevins on third down. Come on. [Toby] And me. I had a 4.0 coming out of high school. Back then, I didn't know anything other than studying hard. But college ain't high school. Come on, baby. [Announcer] What is setting up to be the last play of the game-- [jude] Come on. Stop 'em here, and it's payday. [Toby] Stop 'em. [Jude] Get him. Get him. Somebody nail him. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. [Toby] Life is so sweet. [Toby] Or maybe not. [Announcer] The official has now called a touchdown. That's not a fucking touchdown. [Announcer] Clearly, the running back was not in the end zone-- that is not a fucking touchdown. [Announcer] Half a yard short of the goal line, but they give them the touchdown anyway. That's like 333 each. Mm. Plus 33 on the vig. Right. Plus 33 on the vig. That's like-- like, two semesters worth of books. I knew we shouldn't have done that. So stupid. What were we thinking? Jesus Christ. Casey. When you lose a big bet, the best thing to do is just handle it in a mature fashion. [Jude] Aw, fuck the bears! And fuck their fuckin' fuck defense! [Laughs] Hey. What time is it? [Jude] We gotta get to the drop. Grab the money. Come on. Jesus, Casey. Will you punch it already? I don't wanna get pulled over. I'll pay the fucking ticket. [Jude] Casey, why are you stopping? [Casey] The light's red, man. Oh. Is that him? [Jude] The big guy? [Toby] No. The guy in the car. [Jude] The buick's the pickup guy. [Toby] Mm-hmm. Can we go? Can we drive the car? It's red. I mean... [Toby] He's leaving. What are we doing? [Jude] Follow the buick. I will. If we're late, they double the vig. Blow the light, man. Come on. [Jude] Just 'cause you're sober doesn't mean you have to drive like a dentist. [Toby] Yeah. Come on, Casey. Right, right, right, right, right. [Toby] Yeah, yeah. He's turning into that gate. This must be the place. [Jude] Good. I'll go. I'll go. Do you have the money? Casey, stop the car. [Casey] Okay. Let me out. Give me the money. [Toby] Be careful. I got it. Gate's closing. Hurry. Hello? Hello? Hey. No, no, no. Just makin' a drop. Makin' a drop. Are you fuckin' crazy? Oh, Jesus. You don't come here. That's why we have a drop point, you little fuck. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Left jacket pocket. Left jacket pocket. Don't look at me. I didn't wanna be late. Get outta here. [Screams] College kid followed me here. He didn't want to be late. I gathered. Get inside. [Toby] God, what a shitty day. [Jude] Even shittier night. [Casey] Well, at least we didn't pay the double vig. So, let's at least salvage our buzz. Go to the bar. Dollar drafts. Potential ladies. I'm declaring this night done. Yeah. Me too. No, no. Come on. Come on. I can't go out without my boys. All right. All right. I'll make you a deal. We'll-- we'll, uh, flip for it. [Toby] It's amazing how there are moments in life when things could go one way... Come on. Be bold. ...or they could go another. [Jude] There you go. ...to be such a bastard. [Laughs] All right. All right. All right. Here's the deal-- heads, we go back to our shitty, shitty rooms, and our pathetic lives. But tails... The bar. [Laughs] Both options exist as completely separate and viable futures for just the smallest, unmeasurable nanosecond. But once you step into one future, you never know what the other could have been. Nice. Good. Bet you a round that the next beer ordered is German. I'm down to a dollar. Casey, cover me. [Man] Hey. Give me a Heineken. Yes. No, jude. Heineken's German. No, nut sack, it's from Holland. We won. Hey. What's the haps on the craps, little white bitches? Hey, what's up, Duane? Duane Harrison. Power forward. If I hadn't tutored him in stats, he would've been kicked off the team. What y'all doin' here? [Toby] Chillin'. [Duane] Oh, okay. This is my man, Toby. He's the reason I'm not failing statistics this semester. Hey, man. What's up? Hi. All right. Later. Later, Duane. Hey. They're takin' the conference this year. I'm gonna take a piss. Me too. [Arcade sound] [Overlapping chatter] Hunter mcguire. All-around jock. Known on campus to be cool like a dude. Little one-on-one? I never would've thought she'd look at me twice. Yeah. [Arcade voice] Let's go. Ah. [Buzzer] Bet a buck. [Buzzer] Wow. I kind of destroyed you. It looks like it. You're a really good loser, though. Oh, thank you. It means a lot. I'm Toby. You can call me "loser," if you want. Nice to meet you. I think my turn's over. Yes. Pay up, chump. [Jude] Toby. You didn't even have the balls to get that girl's number. Cost me my last dollar. Here, Casey. Take it. Congratulations. Go have a party. [Casey] You owe me ten more cents. [Jude] What? It's $1.10 with the vig. Out of the mouths of babes. It's clear the only people making any money out of this stuff is bookies, and they make it with their fucking vig. I want my fucking vig. Well, you can collect your fucking vig when you become a fucking bookie. Until then, fuck off. [Casey] Fine. Okay. [Jude] Can you believe this, Toby? He thinks he's a bookie now. And then, sometimes, you open your own mouth. I read this article, a couple weeks ago, about sports betting. It said the biggest growth market was college students, aged 18 to 24. And destiny speaks. [Jude] This is the best idea in the history of mankind. [Toby] I wasn't serious, man. I was kidding. [Jude] Can it possibly be this easy? [Casey] What are you guys thinking? [Jude] Think about it. What does a bookie need? [Toby] What about the risk? [Casey] Isn't this, like, a felony? Jesus, ladies. This isn't the sports book at Caesar's. Yeah. But felony... There's gotta be some way to do this anonymously. Felony. How are we gonna get bettors? Economics 233-- marketing in the new millennium. If-- if demand exists, in a specialized market, merely make your presence known, and word of mouth works wonders. So... That's it. Where do we make our presence known? At the frats. [Laughs] Yes. Exactly. The-- the money thing. We have to have... $2-3,000. I mean... How about an emergency student loan from financial aid? But I mean, it's a really, really bad idea. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Casey. I love this idea. Uncle Sam will fund the whole fucking thing. Come on. We all know we're only going to school to make money. Puritan work ethic. Delayed gratification. We work our asses raw now, and pray to God that we get a six-figure job in the future. So... What's the harm in gettin' a little ahead now? Uh-- fine. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck the money. Let's just do it for the fun of it. The action. Pure and simple. I'm not-- we all have to agree. Three or none. [Laughs] What is that? Is that a smile? That smile looks like a yes. Yes. Yes? Yeah. C-dog. Um, I have to think about it. What? Uh... Casey. Casey, come on. Come on. [Laughs] [Laughs] Fine. [Laughter] We were immortal. Kings of our world. Masters of the future. Old enough to be brilliant. Young enough to be stupid. [Toby] Hey, Duane. I need a little favor, man. Can I meet you at practice? Duane. What's up, man? How you doin'? New arena's tight. Yeah. But it's not enough to play well. I gotta fill up the seats too. Well, there she is. Better men have died trying. What did you do to this? God, why didn't-- hey. Loser. I don't remember you being on the team. Yeah. Actually, Duane asked for a little help. Listen. Do you want to go out with me on Friday? What do you got for me? There's this lambda party I heard about. It's gonna go off. Are you a lambda guy? No. I'm not. Oh. Well, then how did you figure we would get in? Oh-- can you get in? I thought maybe... You could... Let me get this straight. You want to take me to a lambda party that you need me to get us into? [Laughs] No. I-- that's-- that's not what I mean. I'll see you around. Hey. Hey. Stop. Listen. Listen to me. Please. I was not straight up with you before. Here's the deal-- my friend and I, we're starting this-- this sports betting business. Okay? And... We need clients. We thought that lambda would be perfect hunting ground for suckers, you know? That's cool. It's-- it's cool? Pretty balls-out. I didn't expect that from you. [Man] Catch you later, hunter. Why is that? You're kinda white bread. Hey, if you do this, then I'll take you on a real date. Why don't we see how the party goes, first, huh? Can you get three of us in? All right. Check list. Uh... Cell phone's a go. The guy who cloned it said it's pretty much untraceable. Nice. The big board is a go. Whenever you guys get bets, you write 'em on these cards, and then you put 'em up on that board. And then, I get a shitty Internet connection to get the odds, and then I do the math on my shitty computer-- how many times to I have to-- we're not spending $1,000 on a new fucking computer. I'm just saying, it would be so much easier-- I heard you the first million times. [Toby] Come on. This is a fucking business meeting. Is it judgment day, bitch? Is that what you're trying to say? [Toby] Yeah. It's judgment day. Here. Two grand. Emergency student loans. Nice. Bankroll is a go. What are you doing? What-- it's all there. I need 500 to make an impression with the frat guys. You gotta come out big to establish some credibility. As long as we get it back, man. Yeah. Some of it. [Toby] All right. Business cards. Here. Remember. When we pass these out, we are not the bookies. We're just a satisfied customer, doing our favorite bookie a solid by passing along the word. Obviously, do not tell them to ask for jude, Casey, or Toby when the call. We gotta have code names. Well, I don't really wanna take any calls. Doesn't matter, man. You gotta have a code name. Why? Because it's cool. It's cool. I'm Frankie. I'll give you $500 for that name. Of our money? All right. Fuck you, then. Dean got more pussy than Sinatra anyway. I'm dino. Casey, you're Sammy. Why? I'm not black-- [both] Sammy. [Laughs] [Jude] What else? Rules? Yeah. Rules. All right. Yeah. Rule-- rule number one-- uh... No matter what happens, we share everything. Three ways. Nothing comes between us. That's right. You didn't tell this hunter chick what we're doing, did you? No, man. I'm not a chump. I wouldn't do that. All right. Good. So, rule number two. [Toby] No bets over $500. People bet too much, they get into debt. And we get ratted out. [Toby] Any bet over 500, we refer to our old bookies. Agreed. I have a rule. Nobody touches my shitty laptop. [Toby] Hey. Hey. Hey. [Toby] Come on. All right. Let's do this. All right? How's it going? Good. Plus three? Hey. For you? Have a great time. Hey. Right hand. Right hand, please. Other right hand. Right hand. [Jude] Casey. This way. There. Tobe. Game room. Let's go reel these suckers in. Hey, I think I should hang back with hunter, you know? Guy's pussy-whipped already. All right. Yeah. Fine. Casey. Let's do this. Excuse me. I wanna go watch. Oh. [Laughs] Hey, guys. I'm really sorry. Come back when you got more money, huh? Okay. What's the buy-in here? Oh, I think it's a bit rich for you kids. It's 100 each. [Jude] What do you think? Bling. Bling. Bling. [Toby] Julius Garrett. The richest fuck in the forest. If we got Garrett's business, we'd have a business. What's up? Hey. You got a light? Hey. Listen. I didn't mention this before, but could you pretend not to know what's going on here? I wasn't supposed to tell you. Sure. My lips are sealed. Don't worry about it. Thanks. Let's start on ten. I'm in. So, what made you guys decide to do this bookmaking thing? Oh, it's just to scrape up some extra cash, you know? I'm on academic scholarship, so-- what's the real reason? Just the action. Action? Yeah. The action. I mean... Either you know it, or you don't. I know it. I don't know if you do. Well, maybe you'll have to show me sometime. [Laughs] I'll think about it. Hey. How about dinner next week? I can't. I, uh... I got three midterms, a monster paper past due, and two away games with the soccer team the week after that. Yeah. It's really busy for me too. All those midterms and stuff. How 'bout three weeks from now? How 'bout four? How 'bout five? How 'bout three? That's what I thought. Smart guy. Don't Welch. Two pairs. Queens and eights. Three deuces. Whoo. Whoo-hoo. [Garrett] Come to papa. Makes me up only 1150 for the week. [Casey] Mm. [Laughs] How's that? Uh, I-- I won big on that bears game. [Laughs] Sweet. [Jude] See, if you boys are serious, you should hook up with my bookie. He's solid. Do you have some of those cards? [Jude] It's an on-campus drop-off, pick-up. And they're off. Let's go dance. What's up? Let's go. I'm in. [Jude] Oh. What is that? What is that? Oh. Oh. What's up? Now, see, that's... That's gotta be disappointing. That's can't feel good for you right now. [Jude] Sorry. [Laughs] There you go. [Jude] Oh. Oh. Oh. What is that? [Jude] What is that, case? Oh. Oh. That's in your face. [Casey] ...You keep using the same offense. [Jude] Well, why don't you learn how to defend my... [Casey] Why don't you do something different? Why don't you fucking cradle my balls real gentle? You know how-- [phone ringing] [Phone ringing] Oh, fuck. Take it. Yeah? Uh-huh. Yeah? Uh, this is, uh, dino. Buck fifty on Philly. Yeah. Let me get you the latest on that. Casey. What do you got there? My name's Sammy. Right. Fuck off. [Casey] And it's at, uh... Minus 15 and a half. [Jude] Right. Hello? Sir. Yeah. Uh... [Stammers] Philly's givin' 15 and a half. Okay. You're-- you're-- you're-- uh, a new client, I assume? Okay. I-- I need your-- your name, and your, uh, phone number, and, uh, we'll call you back with the-- the drop-off and pick-up info. [Jude] Okay. Okay. Um... Is that it? Yeah. That's it. Cool. All right. Holy shit. [Applause] Ah. [Jude] Go. [Laughs] Go. Oh. Nice. There he is. Our cherry. This is our first bettor, boys. Oh. An occasion like this calls for-- [phone ringing] This is Frankie. Okay. Yeah. San Fran. [Beeping] Uh, can-- can you hold one one second? Hello? This is Frankie. Uh, let me put you on hold. One-- one-- one second. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Can I-- can I take down your information? Yeah. Just give me your name and-- and, uh, and address, please. No. No. I've got 'em comin' in at plus six and a half. The over's 45 and a half. That's-- that's direct from Vegas. Hey. Can you read this? What is this? Is that a nine or a four? I can't read any of these. Sorry. Here. Here. Can I int-- sir? Can you turn down the music? Can I interest you in a parlay or a teaser? Hold on. What's-- what is that number? That's a-- that's a-- a four. Or, um, uh... Maybe it's a seven. I can feel the fucking tumor growing. We gotta get headsets, man. [Beeps and whirring] It's fucking jamming, dude. Good luck, sir. Here. Go, go, go. Go. Fuck, man. I tried to take all-- [Casey] Dude, I can't read any of these. I'm sorry, sir. We're-- we've been swamped today. [Casey] Are you practicing to be a doctor or something? Okay. We'll keep that in mind. What can I help you with? [Sighs] [Casey] We can't do it like this anymore. We need a new system. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. That's it. $4,340. Can't we start upgrading now? [Laughs] Yeah. Let's go shopping, boys. So, assuming a maximum bet of $500, I'm using a probability-based formula to calculate the risk between straight bets and over-unders with teasers and parlays. So, if we have too much money on one team, the computer tells us. If we have enough teasers and parlays to statistically balance it out, the computer tells us. If we want to know how much money we could make or lose on any given day, the computer tells us. And if Toby's mom gives me another blowjob? The computer tells us. I'll take that. Give me two on Detroit. [Man] Two on Detroit. Got it. 50 on 'zona. [Man] Got you for 50 on Arizona. [Toby] You had to love the frats. In no time, we had over a hundred clients lined up for the kill. Soon, word of the bookies spread across the entire campus. Monday was collection. Clients left payments in specific books we assigned them and dropped them in the night slot. They had to be in by 6:00 A.M., or a double vig kicked in. Jude worked the ass-early shift every Monday to make sure no one else touched our books. [Jude] Can this be this fucking easy? What's the harm in getting a little ahead now? [Toby] Friday was payout. This time, each client had a different book they were to check at a pre-determined time. Jude made sure to use books that have never been checked out in the history of the school. Philosophy, the unabridged works of Plato, or anything in a foreign language. It didn't start slowly and grow like a plant you nurture. It blew up like a fucking atom bomb. And I mean immediately. The future just happened. We paid off the loans right away. Pretty soon, we were making enough to start blowing some serious paper. I'm talking eight big on our best weeks. Two on our worst. We had to open a safe deposit box at the bank to keep it all. At this rate, we'd split 150k by spring break. We top out at a nickel. Call that other number for the other bookies I gave you. Hey. I got it right here in front of me, man. I can't believe you of all people are complaining. We're small time, man. We can't take that. Call that other number I gave you. Okay. You're all set then... You're all set. Sammy. Dino. Frankie. [Man 1] The one pushing the cart. [Man 2] How do you know that's the guy? [Man 1] I saw him with the books. [Man 3] Okay. Let's do it. Fuckers. Toby. Tobe. Case. Is Toby with you? [Ringing] Oh, pick up the fuckin' phone. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [Phone ringing] Hey. Toby. Be at the fountain in 15 minutes. I'll meet you there. What? I got-- I got jumped for three big on the way home. But I know the guys who did it. We'll get it back. Hey. Hey. Jude. Hold on. Okay? Just don't-- don't do anything stupid. No, no, no. No. Listen to me. If we let one guy get away this... Then it's gonna get around that we're soft. Dude. Hold on, okay? Okay. Listen. Just let me think. All right? I don't know. Get a couple big guys from the bar to go with you to work on mondays. Follow you home, or something. Yeah. Maybe. What about those fuckers that jumped me? Let's forget about them. Just-- I don't know. Chalk it up as an operational loss. We need to keep a low profile. Let it go. Oh, fuck that. Jude. Just hold on, all right? Trust me on this. Okay? Don't-- don't do anything. I gotta take a shower before I go anywhere. Hey, you did-- you did really good. It was great. Hey. Are we cool? Is everything all right? Yeah. I got it. I'll be good. Okay. Later. Sorry. So, what's the plan? Today... You and me are gonna get serious. Ah. I'm sorry. A bet's a bet. Can we get another round, please? I'll lose all day if it gets you drunk. [Laughs] You wish. All right. How about this time... I will play... One-handed. Okay. Just to humiliate me even more. Or we could do something else. No. Let's play. Let's just raise the stakes a little bit. Raise the stakes? Getting beat seven times in a row isn't enough punishment for you? I'm not the one afraid of losing here. Oh, I'm not afraid of losing. Okay. So then, let's make the game a little more exciting. You're not gonna get me naked. Oh, well. See ya later. Oh, come on. What do you wanna bet? Well, it's... It's gotta be something risky. You know? Make your palms sweat. I mean, if you're not nervous about losing, then why play at all? Hmm. We're not talking about money, are we? No. Not this time. If you lose... I do get to see you naked. And what are you willing to risk? I'll do whatever. Okay. If you lose... I get to see your little, secret betting operation in action. No. No. No. I-- that's-- that's off limits. Sounds like it's on then. All right. One-handed. Holding you to that. [Man 1] Dude. Roundhouse. Roundhouse. Sweet. How'd you do that? [Man 1] Oh, yeah. [Laughs] [Man 2] Damn. [Man 2] Oh. [Ball clattering] Oh, yeah. Getting kinda easy. [Toby] It's gotta be something risky. Make your palms sweat. Go, man. Come on. [Shouting] You're dead. Get that guy. [Car honking] Over there. Come on. [Grunting] Come here. [Grunting] It's a little different one-on-one, huh? If you even call us again, we'll fuckin' kill you. Bitch. Hey. Hey. You okay? Never better. What did you do today? Nothin'. Did you do your 131 paper? [Laughs] No. It's due tomorrow, man. Mom? Is that-- is that you? I'm just sayin', man. It's due. Dad? When-- when-- when-- when did you two fly in? [Sighs] [Larry] Trevor Shannon? What kind of name is that for a black fighter? Sounds like an Irish name. He should be named more like, uh... Tyrik. Or, uh, Calvin. [Phone ringing] Yeah. This is Larry. Vincent. Huh? Take this call. It's another college kid. [Sighs] This is gonna suck. Whatever. You told her a date. The more the merrier, right? [Laughs] This is a bad idea. I think a bad idea is keeping a $500 limit, when we can handle much more than that. Hey. Hey. Lower your voice in the hall, man. I told you. We can't do that. It's way too risky. It's how clients get in deep shit. Cops get called. You worry like a school girl. Case. I'm not ready yet. Gimme a second. We can't take that kind of trouble. Come on, Casey. We're late. [Jude laughs] [Toby] Don't embarrass me, jude. [Jude] Oh, what? Me? Excuse me, do I know you? I'm the man of your dreams. Yes. May I help you? Uh, reservation for six. "Winter." [Vincent] Got another call today from some college kid I ain't never heard of. Somebody's layin' off. Like we need this bullshit. Relax. Relax. Next time you talk to one of his clients, you get some info. Nice fuckin' room. Jesus. Who the fuck is this? [Thud] Mm. Sorry. It's kids. Cheers. I'm fuckin' starving. Do you eat at all? [Waiter] Madame. 50 bucks says that's a fuckin' toupee on that guy. [Jude laughs] How's it goin'? It's goin'. This loud kid with the crazy hair... I know him from somewhere. [Hunter] Osso buco, penne arrabiata. Prosciutto with melon to start. Same. What the fuck is happening in this goddamn country? Don't let it ruin your enjoyment of, uh, chardonnay with veal. Huh? So, hunter. That's a nice dress. [Jude] It's very mature. Thanks. I put down 20 bucks you were gonna show up in a Jersey and cleats. Yeah. That's funny. I should've put down 50 you'd show up in nothing at all. All right. A fuckin' ball Buster. Here we go. Okay, you two. This round is over. Let's take a little trip to the bathroom, buddy, before we get kicked outta here. [Toilet flushes] I, uh... I-- I-- I think it's going well. You're such an asshole. Just stop, all right? Yeah. Fine. That's all you had to say. [Imitates whip] [Sniffs] Hey. Were you lookin' at me? No. You know me? No. Do I know you? No. You sure? No-- yes. Yes. Yeah. I think I know you. Oh, yeah. You eat here before? No. What? No. I-- you gonna eat here again? [Larry] Huh? No. [Sighs] [Laughs] Wipe your nose. Time to go. Let's go right now. What? Just fucking trust me. It's time to go. Come on. Come on. I'm really sorry. It's okay. I was ready to leave anyway. I'm really sorry about tonight. Right. I swear he can be a good guy if you get to know him. I'm sure. Let me make it up to you. Please. Let me take you out. Just... Have some fun. Look. Next time, we go alone. And I'll make the plans. All right? [Professor] All right, everybody. Turn in your exams. All right. Time's up. [Jude] Toby. Tobe. Wait up, man. Toby, hold on a second. Hold up, man. Hey. Hey. We're cool, pal, right? Yeah. We're cool. I haven't seen you all day. Hey, listen though... You would tell me if something was wrong, right? [Laughs] Do you need a hug, jude? Listen. I'm serious, man. Yes. I know. Things are good. Okay? What are you guys doing? Just talkin' about you. Why? He's kidding. Shut up. Come here. Nobody fucks with this. My boys here. Hey, guys. I have a test at 9:00. Keep it down or I'll call security. Get outta here. This is our house. Nice. [Laughter] Come on. Come have a drink. Hey hunter. It's Toby here. I'm just callin' to, uh... Maybe set up a little rematch with you or something. So, um... Just call me back. Okay. Bye. [Knocking on door] What's going down, dawgs? You mind if I come in? Uh... No. I got a noise complaint. You dawgs been havin' a little party here? Uh... No. We-- we were... It's over now. Good. Good. That's fair enough. Goddamn. This is so thin, it's flat, huh? Toby. You gotta lock this shit-- come in. Come in. Is this your room? Hey. Don't look at him when I'm talkin' to you. If I talk to you, you look at me. Mm. You understand that? Yeah. Is this your room? Yes. Yeah, if you can call it that. What? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's my room. You guys know the, uh, dorm policy on alcohol here? Yes. We do. We do. Sir. Do you? Yes. I know it well. Good. Good. So, let's just keep it down after 10:00, all right? Yeah. This might be your-- your "crib." But this is my house. You understand? I hear ya, homes. You-- you hear me what? I hear ya. What did you say? No, that's... What? I understand, sir. Good. We're understood. What's wrong with this guy? Son, are you all right? I'm fine, mom. Mm. He's cute, right? Yeah. Adorable. Fuckin' miserable police academy reject. Holy shit. You were a big help. [Laughs] [Phone rings] Yeah. Hold on a minute. Hey. Larry. [Vincent] You want 25,000 on Michigan? [Laughs] That's a lot for a college kid. What's your name? "Julius Garrett." You've called here before. Yeah. What's your reference? Of course I know them. Do you? [Vincent] What's their fuckin' number then? [Casey] This is yours? It's good, right? Come on. Let's go for a ride. Do some shoppin'. I've gotta study. Fine. It's you and me, Casey. Here. You drive. See? [Laughs] I think you should really take it down a notch. No, man. On the contrary, I think you need to take it up a notch. [Sighs] [Engine rumbles] [Tires screeching] It's a totally student-run operation. I heard it's huge. No shit? I swear to God. They make a shitload of money. It's a totally awesome idea. Hey. Do you guys know what we're doing in there? Yeah. Everybody does. What are we doing in there? Um... Studying. Yeah. See you later. Bet you get a 4.0, man. [Laughter] Oh, dude. I'm so stoned. [Laughter] Jesus. You're late. Colleen says these have to be done by noon. Don't touch these. Ever. Asshole. [Phone ringing] What? How's it hanging, kid? Who's this? You guys are, uh, operating in territory that's, uh, already spoken for. We need to discuss some arrangements. Yeah. Yeah. We're doin' fine on our own. Thank you. I don't think you exactly understand what I'm sayin'. No. I think I understand you exactly. [Sniffs] You wanna fuck us. And we don't wanna bend over. End of story. No. I can find you. Yeah? What's my name? Now I'm mad. Hey. Dude, I still got papers in there. Idiot. [Beep] This is Frankie. Tampa bay's at, uh, six and a half. Toby. Toby. Guess what. Guess what I did with that girl Hanna from art history class. Whoa. Hi. Hi. [Toby] Oakland's at nine. It's really hot right now. Hey. Where's jude? Hold on. He's still at the library. Does he know about her? Uh-- [Sighs] Don't worry about it. Just tally these, man. We're way behind. We'll hit a parlay instead. And go with an even dollar on t.B. And Miami. All right. Even 50 on Tampa giving seven. Done. [Ding] [Beep] [Toby] Frankie. What's up? Did you check your book on time? [Door opens] Hey. [Toby] I can't do anything for you. We can't pay you twice because you call up and say so. It doesn't work that way. I'm gonna go. What the fuck are you doing here? I was invited. Casey, what's go-- does she know? Jude-- Jesus Christ, Toby. You fucking told her? [Hunter] Will you calm down? All right? I'm leaving. Fuck you. No, no, no, no, no. It's fine. Stay. Make yourself at home. You already fucked everything up. [Toby] Jude-- Jesus, Toby. What the hell are you thinking? [Toby] Calm down. Casey, fuckin' help. Lock the door and hit the blinds. It's no big deal, all right? Ah. Fuck. Cheap ass shit. [Toby] Dude. She's cool, okay? You know what this is? This is what happens... When you only think with your dick. [Toby] Come on, man. Don't be a fucking asshole. I'm-- I'm the asshole? You fucked us. You fucked everything. Fuck, man. Motherfucker. [Grunting] I'm good. I'm good. Get the fuck off me. Not till you promise to calm down. Calm down. Get off of me. Do you want me to get someone? It's okay. Just go. Yeah. You go ahead. He's got it under control. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck you. Hey. I'll see you later, girl. I thought I might find you here. That got a little out of control. Are you okay? Uh, yeah. I'm fine. Let's just-- let's go get some food or something. This doesn't piss you off even a little bit? I mean, he took a swing at you. If one of my friends came at me that way, I would either write him off, or try to help him out, maybe-- look. Listen. This is my problem, okay? Why don't you let me handle it? All right? All right. All right. Hey. Hey. Listen, man. I'm sorry that I brought hunter here. [Sniffs] Did you catch up with her? Yeah. I saw her. I was out of it, man. I was... I was really fuckin' out of it. I'm sorry. I'm just worried about you. You know? All right. Um... I've been thinking about this a lot, and um... You know, we always do everything together. And so, I have a proposition for you. I will stop using right now... If you agree to expansion. Kill the limit? Yeah. And you'll quit right now? Just-- just like that? Cold Turkey? Yeah. Absolutely. [Laughs] You always gotta have things your way, don't you? [Laughs] Yeah. [Laughs] What, are you new? Okay. Yes. It's-- it's done. I'll kill the limit. All right. Deal. Is it all gone? Yup. Flushed all of it. Which, uh, which toilet did you use? [Laughs] I'm not telling you. [Laughs] I'm joking. Not that it would matter anyway. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. Yeah. It'll be all right, man. Yeah. I'm glad we're friends, Toby. Yeah. Me too. [Snoring] Get up. Police. Right there. Come on. Let me see your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Geez. Can someone toss me my pants? What? Do you think I'm stupid? You think I'm stupid, huh? Is that it? You think nobody noticed all the expensive shit you got here? That big, wide-ass screen t.V. With the, uh... High-definition receiver, plus the thx DVD? This looks like a fuckin' best buy commercial. How 'bout that $50,000 car parked downstairs? What? Did you just found it in the street, or... Are we doing a little low-grade drug dealing here? Maybe some x, or some, uh, some grass? Maybe some coke, or some little-- nothing. How 'bout the dog? [Officer] The place is clean. We can't find anything. [Jude] Hey, mark. How's it goin'? [Dog yelps] Is there some sort of official apology we should be expecting? What happened, you guys? They fuckin' kicked the door in, dude. They thought it was a drug bust. Fuck 'em. We're free and clear now. They're not gonna raid us twice. We'll sue their ass. [Phone ringing] [Beep] Hello. [Toby] Oh, hey. What's going on? Okay. What do you need? Oh, yeah? Fuckin' asshole. What was that? It's Julius fuckin' around. Says he wants a hundred grand on next week's Preston game. It's Julius Garrett. He's fuckin' loaded. He can totally cover that bet. $100,000? Guys, the spread is ten points to Kingston. That's five easy baskets. Preston's a bunch of honky white boys. We're leading the league. We'll beat 'em by 20, easy. We cannot take that bet, jude. There's no way. Gimme the phone. Wh-- what about the limit? We killed the limit, Casey. [Toby] Yeah. If you stay clean. That was the deal. Look at me. I'm-- I'm keepin' my side of the deal. Gimme the phone. [Beeping] Yeah. Hello. Can I speak to, uh, Julius, please? [Professor felix] Your early exams are showing you at a 3.68. You know that's not a 3.7. Fortunately, your scholarship allows for one probationary semester. Now, my office is here to help. So, let's see what we can do to get you back on track. Sir. [Announcer] Dobson pressured by boucher... [Casey] I hope Kingston has an off night. Stop worrying, Casey. Preston sucks. It won't even be close. Nice. [Knocking on door] Hey. You guys are so fucked. What? Rumor has it jude fixed the Preston game. He paid off some of our starters to make sure the game is a blowout. Oh, Jesus. It was a gift. Who cares if they play a little harder than usual? Who cares? Don't you understand that if anyone gets wind of this, it's not just the ncaa investigating, it's the FBI. The entire athletics department of this school will go up in flames. This goes beyond taking a couple bets. Hey. Hold on. Jude, did-- did you do this? What? Holy fuck, jude. That's fucked up. You stay away from the athletes. [Toby] You should've talked to us first. Hey, d. What up, h? So, we're gonna win today? Shit... We'll see. Listen, uh, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. What's up? I know you like Toby. He's cool. Why? All right. Here it is. Um... He and some of his friends are running a bookmaking operation. Jude paid off some of your teammates to make sure you guys take it by ten. You know I got nothing to do with that shit. I know. I know. Then let me tell you something. Do what you want with it. We ain't coverin' that spread. [Vincent] College players sell cheap. I give 'em just ten each to take a dive. But this kid... He tried to buy 'em off for a nickel a pop. Not in my town. They're in pocket now. Julius did well. Fuckin' children. Should I erase Garrett's debt? Yeah. Mm. Ouch. [Vincent] Oh, yeah. I finally got this kid's name. [Phone ringing] [Video game sounds] Jude. Turn that shit down. [Phone ringing] Hello. [Hunter] Listen to me. I'm giving you the heads up. You're gonna get screwed. Someone outbid jude. The team's gonna shave. No way they can win by ten. Call it off. Hey. That was hunter. She said somebody outbid you. The team is gonna shave points. Oh, whatever, man. She's trying to fuck with your head. Yeah, well, I'm gonna find out. Duane. Hey. Hey. Come here. Two minutes. Two minutes. Please. What? Are you in on it? Fuck y'all. Duane. I had nothing to do with this, man. Swear to God. I had nothing to do with it. Whatever, man. Yo, I can't be talkin' to you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Duane. Listen. I'm fucked here. Okay? My ass is on the line. You gotta help me out. Just cover the spread for me. Ten points. This ain't no playstation, bitch. You think I can just go out there and do it by myself? Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm begging you. What do you need? What is it gonna take? Because I can help your family out with bills, and groceries... Ya know? I can do that stuff. So, that's how it works? I'm your nigga now? Fuck. [Phone ringing] Yeah. It's true. We are in serious shit. Have Casey call Julius to cancel the bet, and you start laying it off now to cover that hundred grand. It's way too late to lay that much off, man. Those players are not gonna fuck me. Relax, come back, and watch the game. Son of a fucking bitch. [Beeping] [Phone ringing] I'll be right back. [Beeping] [Phone ringing] [Phone ringing] Speak. Yeah. I wanna put a hundred grand on Preston. You wanna put how much on Preston? 100 grand. Or anything close. I'm willing to put down 40 cash in collateral. Ah. This must be jude. It's-- it's a friend of jude's. Oh, I see. So, you help him with his operation, and so forth. Did you get a lot of action today? I hear you decided to take real bets. You're big shots now, huh? Fuck. [Car honking] Tell you what, friend of jude. I hope you can cover for our young friend Julius. Because we're gonna be serving as his collection agency. Oh, shit. [Laughs] Fuck me. Fuck me. [Crowd cheering] Ugh. [Announcer] Blocked by o'shea. Ortega wanted a foul, but clearly that was clean. We come back the other direction-- oh, through the middle. That's a layup. Right there. He just let him drive right to the basket. Where is the defense from Kingston? And Kingston state really can't get anything going. Layup, no good. They've missed yet another one, and we come back the other way. Preston looking inside. They've got it. Puts it up and off the glass good. This is unbelievable. I have never seen Kingston play so poorly. ...signaling for a timeout. He wants to slow things down, and get Kingston back on track. [Toby] Five baskets. Ten points. $100,000. Is this gonna be okay? Who the hell knows? It's too late to pull over now. [Announcer] Underneath... Up and good. Harrison with the layup. What a beautiful layup. He drove right down to the basket untouched. And Harrison now looking again from the outside drives inside... Two-handed slam. And again with a beautiful dunk. Now, that's a first team all American for you. He turned things around and all the kids are playin'... Stolen by friarson. Back to Harrison. Alley-oop. It's gonna be-- good. That was beautiful. We've got another team that's shown up out here. There's Harrison again. And they take the lead. A beautiful three-pointer. Keep it up. Running the other direction. Kingston state a whole new ball club since substitutions early in the first half. And another jam-- oh, yeah. [Laughs] Harrison, now with nine assists... Ten rebounds-- and there's a three... It's good. Look at the leadership of Duane Harrison. [Whistle] Oh. It's a fuckin' foul. Harrison fouled there with no time left. Just one second remains. And who would've thought it? Come on. Come on. Two more points. Please, God. ...of Harrison, with a beautiful comeback. He hits the first one. Holy shit. Oh, God. One more point. Please, God, please. [Toby] One basket. Come on. One basket. Come on... [Shouting] Duane. Motherfucker yes. [Cheering] Yeah. I love you. Yeah. [Laughs and shouts] Hey. Hey. [Laughs] I'm just so glad we're not getting killed. Oh. [Phone ringing] Yeah. Hold on a minute. It's the fucking kid. He wants to know if we're gonna cover for Julius' debt. Let me make this clear. You are lucky to walk away dead even from this. So do that. Walk away. If I hear you take any more action... There'll be consequences. Find this kid. [Toby] Let it go, jude. It's over. We're getting that money. I'll guarantee you those guys are holding at least a hundred big after collection, before payout. So, we go and get our hard-earned share. You've lost your mind. No, I haven't. You need a nap, or something. Oh, fuck you and your nap. You need to stop being such a pussy. Oh, I'm a pussy? We go and we take what we deserve. You should be thankful. There's no way that this is gonna happen. You need help. Listen to yourself. Take your help and shove it up your ass. I've kept my side of the deal. Please stop this crazy fuckin' talk-- you're either with me, or you're not. You're in or you're out. I'm out. [Phone ringing] What? Dino. Yeah. What am I? Fuckin' t.V. Guide? I don't know what channel it's on. Hey. I just came by to tell you it was the mob. They were trying to get us under their thumb. I guess it's a good thing you won, then. Yeah. Yes, it was. I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm done... With this whole thing. I'm out of it. Yeah? Yeah. Can I just come in? And we can talk about it maybe? Hunter, I don't see what the problem is, you know? The problem? You're taking risks... That involve more people than just you. You're taking chances with other people's lives. Toby... You need to learn when to walk away. Go home. [Beep] You have one new message. [Beep] [Jude] Hey. Listen. Your Christmas present's in your desk drawer. You can go ahead and open it. It doesn't seem possible, but if you have any balls left, meet your two best friends at our old bookie's place at 12:00. [Beep] Thanks for drivin', man. I'm fuckin' hammered. Why are we picking this money up so late? I guess they didn't wanna sit on such a big payout. Mm. It's right here. It's right around the corner. [Mumbles] [Sniffs] Ah. Here do a quick bump. No. No? What are you doin', man? I'm just-- I'm tired, man. I need a little... Celebratory pick-me-up. All right. Ah. Wait here for me. Seriously. What the fuck are you doing with that, man? Relax, man. It's just in case. In case of what? You don't remember what happened to me the last time I was here? Dude, you should give me the gun. No. Fuck you. They don't even know that we're coming, do they? I'm not doing this. All right. Listen. That's-- that's our money in there, man. That's ours. I'm not leaving until we get it. Well, I'm not gonna be a part of this. Yeah? Well, then fine. Fuck you. You're not driving my car. Fine. Then I'm just gonna walk. Yeah-- you're gonna-- Casey. Case. No, no. Dude. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Look at me. Stop. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. It's me. It's just you and me here now. I can-- I can do this shit myself. I just-- it would-- it would mean a whole lot to me if you had my back. Casey. Are you gonna help me or not? [Car honking] [Tires screeching] I'll be in and out, case. No problem. Hey. Toby, what the fuck? No. It's off. Get out of here. Oh, fuck you. Jude. Come on, man. Hey. [Grunting] Give me the gun. I figured a way around this so no one has to get killed. Give me the damn gun. Ugh. [Grunting] Guys. [Grunting] I've got a way around this. Jude. Jude. You gotta trust me. I got a plan. Okay? Let's go. Let's just go. Jude, do it my way. This one time. Trust me. [Toby] Sometimes you dig yourself into such a deep hole... The only way out is to keep on digging. Whoa. Nice face. I should see the other guy, right? Huh? So, uh... Tell me I came here for a reason. You owe me and my associates $100,000. Now, we're assuming that's a loss, but we want you off our backs. You're right. It is a loss, and things are only gonna get worse. The thing is... I think that I have a way we can work this out. Go ahead. I'm listening. One last bet. You pick the game. You pick the team. If you win, we pay you $100,000. And we won't take any more bets. If we win... You leave us alone and we forget that any of this shit ever happened. What are you, stupid? No. We're gamblers. Like you. I'll call you about the game tomorrow. We're not the same. You and your friends are gamblers. I'm a businessman. [Boxing bell] [Announcer] Trevor Shannon, the defending champ, comes out in the white trunks. Rodriguez, the number three contender, comes out in the white trunks with red stripes. [Toby] A boxing match. Fuckin' mafia. What do you expect? The guy Larry gave us was Trevor Shannon-- defending middleweight champion. Larry's guy was umberto Rodriguez. Our guy Shannon was favored four to one. But Larry made it clear it was an even-money bet between us. No odds and no vig. Sweet of him. [Announcer] It's an overhand right. Shannon's hands down by his sides, and he is out. I don't even think we need a count for this one. Referee walks over and takes a look, and Trevor Shannon is out cold. I have no idea what he was doing with his hands. He looked so good defensively up to that point in the fight. [Toby] It all went as planned. We knew the match had to be fixed. So, we bet like mad dogs against the guy Larry gave us. What is that? Is that a smile? [Toby] We bet everything. You're a fucking genius. [Toby] I mean, total liquidation of assets. Jude gave up his car, we sold our t.V., our stereo, our satellite dish, our furniture. Everything but the ass God blessed us with. We bet all of our earnings from the operation. We even bet our credit card limits on the Internet. [Phone ringing] Yeah. Hey. No kiddin'. Oh, that hurts. Ouch. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry. Ah. No. No. We hit nothin'. I'll talk to you later. That was sal. He just told me some college kid took him big on this fight. [Vincent] He's cryin' his ass off right now. He's such a fat moron. He never knows the call. Fuck me. Good job, kid. [Toby] 100 went to Larry, as promised. 300 went to Frankie, dino and Sammy. It was the big score... And we came out on top. [Laughter] [Toby] And with that, it was over. Jude wasn't the first genius to flunk out of college. All right, man. You take care. Yeah. You too. Later, man. [Toby] We stay in touch, but... It's not the same. What is? I lost my scholarship, but with the hundred grand, I'm covered into grad school. Casey-- he switched majors. Made Dean's list. It's a big campus. I see him, but not often. I wonder all the time... Is there any significance to the people we meet in our lives? Does our life follow fate? Or chance? I saw hunter the other day on campus. I asked her if there was any way she would give me a second chance. She looked me right in the eye, and said she'd play me for it. Best two out of three. Ugh. [Grunting] Maybe we should get a wheel barrel. [Muffled screams] Wheel "barrow." Right. "Wheel barrel." That's what I said. Should I get one? [Muffled protests] No. Oh, I know that look. [Muffled protests] You hungry? Huh? [Muffled screams] I think eating would, uh... Make you happy again. Give me that. Last time, you almost cut your toes off. It was raining. Remember? My hands were wet. It slipped. Give me that. [Muffled screams] Yeah. You're moody. Maybe we should go to Charlie's, and get some of that chicken piccata you like. [Trunk closes] That's with the red sauce, right? [Chainsaw starts]
