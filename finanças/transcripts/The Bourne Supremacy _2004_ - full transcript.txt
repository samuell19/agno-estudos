No. lt's just bits and pieces. l can hear Conklin's voice and there's that photograph, but. . . l just can't stay with it. But you're sure it's not just a bad dream? lt happened. lt was a mission. And I was there. You should write it down. Now, two years we're scribbling in that notebook. lt hasn't been two years. lt's always bad and now it's just the same thing over and over again. But that's why we write it down. Because sooner or later, you remember something good. l do remember something good. All the time. LANDY: I want one final go around. MAN: All teams listen up. We are standing by for final green. MAN 1: Survey Two, l need to know when you've got eyes. (OVER RADIO) This is Survey Two. I have eyes. MAN 1: Copy that. Survey One, this is Hub.

Martin? l'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy. LANDY: lt's where we came out. lt's a lot of money, Pam. For a thief, a mole. lf it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price. Hub, this is Survey Two. Escort is breaking off. Mobile One is entering the building. Gentlemen, l have the seller on-site and in play. Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss. All right, Pam. Your call. Go. We're on.

(HONKlNG HORN) All right. That's twice now l've seen the same guy. l saw him in town. He was at the telegraph office. Are you sure? How can you be sure? lt's just wrong.

What if it's not who you think it is? lt's them. lt's Treadstone. Jason, don't do it. Look, Marie, I warned them. l don't want you to do it. l told them what would happen if they didn't leave us alone. lt's never gonna be over like this. l don't want. . . We don't have a choice. Yes, you do. (GLASS SHATTERlNG) (GRUNTlNG) Thank you. MAN: Two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines, and one of them failed. The fingerprint's from the one that didn't go off. LANDY: And the Germans can't match it? MAN 1: No. Nobody's got it. We checked out every database we could access. But we're hooked into Langley now. Run it. Okay. What the hell's Treadstone? All right. Get me a flight. We're going to Langley. (SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN) (SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN) Two men dead. Three million in cash gone, no Neski files and all very public. This is still a clandestine agency, no? l don't view this event as a failure. You call it a success? We have a lead. A fingerprint left by the assassin. lt's one of us. Who is it? What can you tell me about Treadstone? Treadstone? That's where the trail dead-ends. lf you want an answer, you're going to have to give me a level five SCl access. We have a lead, Marty. All right. You've got your clearance. But you're on a very short leash. And you'll give a full report to the group. l wanna know where you're going with this. Sir. (PHONE RINGING) LANDY: Ward? Yes? Pamela Landy. Hey, Pam. What can I do for you? l was hoping you had some time for me. Time for what? l'm free right now, actually. That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule. Excuse me, l need to. . . Excuse me. Can I help you? Yeah, l'm here to see Mr. Abbott. 20 minutes? See you. Operation Treadstone. Never heard of it. That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam, I think you might have wandered a little past your pay grade. That's a warrant from Director Marshall granting me unrestricted access to all personnel and materials associated with Treadstone. So, what are we looking at? l wanna know about it. Know about it? lt was a kill squad. Black-on-black. We closed it down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here. So I think you better take this back to Marty and let him know exactly what you're doing. He does. l've been down to the archives. l have the files, Ward. Let's talk about Conklin. What are you after, Pam? You wanna fry me? You want my desk. ls that it? l wanna know what happened. What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You got the files. Then let's cut the crap. Conklin had these guys wound so tight, they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one. The guy went for a job, screwed the op, never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. lt all went sideways. So you had Conklin killed? l mean, if we're cutting the crap. l've given 30 years and two marriages to this agency. l've shoveled shit on four continents. l'm due to retire next year. But if you think l'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. And Marshall, too. lt had to be done. LANDY: And Bourne? Where is he now? ABBOTT: Dead in a ditch. Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu. Who knows. l think I do. l had a deal going down in Berlin last week. And during the buy, both our case officer and the seller were killed. They were killed by Jason Bourne. (KNOCKlNG AT DOOR) They're ready for us upstairs. (BEEPlNG) (SPEAKlNG lN lTALlAN) (DOOR SLAMMlNG) Seven years ago, $20 million of ClA funds disappeared during a wire transfer through Moscow. ln the investigation that followed we were contacted by a Russian politician, Vladimir Neski. Neski claimed we had a leak and that we'd been ripped off by one of our own. And were we? We never found out. We were negotiating a meet with Mr. Neski when he was killed. By who? His wife. The case had gone cold until a month ago when we found a source. Another Russian in Berlin who claimed to have access to the Neski murder files. We thought we had another bite at the apple. Turns out the assassin was one of our own, Jason Bourne. Now I know Treadstone's not a very popular subject around here, but we found some interesting things when we dug a little deeper. This is Conklin's personal computer. His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys and case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for. Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted file with an account number to a bank in Zurich. At the time of his death, he was sitting on a personal account in the amount of $760,000. You know what his budget was? We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark. lt was his own account. He was up to something. This is supposed to be definitive? What's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin. So what's your theory? Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is dead. No one's disputing that, Ward. For Christ's sake, Marty, you knew Conklin. Does this scan? l mean, at all? Cut to the chase, Pam. l think that Bourne and Conklin were in business together, that Bourne's still involved and that whatever information l was trying to buy in Berlin was big enough to bring Bourne out from hiding to kill again. How's that scan? Excuse me, sir, but you're not gonna believe this. Jason Bourne's passport just popped up on the grid in Naples. Okay. Contact Naples. They need to know who they're dealing with. Find out what kind of local assets we have in place there. No, it's nothing. Some guy's name came up on the computer. (SPEAKlNG lN lTALlAN) Yeah. Hey, listen, Tom, l'm gonna call you back, okay? All right. Mr. Bourne, l'm John Nevins. l'm with the US Consulate. l just have a few questions for you. (CLEARlNG THROAT) You're coming out of Tangiers. ls that correct? What's the nature of your visit to Naples? (SPEAKlNG lN lTALlAN) Look, l don't know what you did, and I don't know who you're working for. But I promise you this, you're gonna play ball one way or the other. (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) (SlGHlNG) This is Nevins. This is Tom Cronin, Cl Operations Officer calling from Langley, Virginia. Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody? Yes, I do. Listen, he's an Agency priority target. Detain him and call me back as soon as he's secure. l understand. He's been detained. Here's the number. He's being interrogated by a field officer out of the Consulate. (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) (CELL PHONE BEEPlNG) Hello. This is Pamela Landy, Cl Supervisor. Where do we stand? l think he got away. Damn it. Have you locked down the area? Locked it down? No, no. This is. . . This is ltaly. They don't exactly lock down. How long have you worked for the Agency? Me? For four years. Well, if you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. Last week in Berlin, he assassinated two men, one a highly experienced field officer. l want you to secure that area. l want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now. ls that clear? Yes, sir. . . Ma'am. l'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes which means you're gonna call me back in 30. And when I ask you where we stand, l had better be impressed. Berlin? l already have a team in place there. l doubt that Bourne's in Naples ready to start a family. You have no idea what you're getting into. Do you have any idea? From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and eluded every single person that you've sent to find him. So you read a couple of files on Jason Bourne and that makes you an expert? This is my case, Ward. Enough. I want you both on that plane. We are, all of us, going to do what we were either too lazy or inept to do the last time around. We're gonna find this son of a bitch and take him down. l'm not having Jason Bourne destroy any more of this agency. ls that definitive enough for you? Yes. LANDY: Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. Last week in Berlin, he assassinated two men, one a highly experienced field officer. l want that area... ...he assassinated two men, one a highly experienced field officer. l want that area secured. l want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

(WOMAN WHlMPERlNG) (GASPlNG) (ENGlNE STARTlNG) (BELL TOLLlNG) CRONlN: You'd been working at Treadstone for three years and your cover at the time was what? That I was an American student in Paris. And what exactly did your job with Treadstone in Paris consist of? l had two responsibilities. One was to coordinate logistical operations. The other was to monitor the health of the agents. Health, meaning what? Their mental health. Because of what they had been through, they were prone to a variety of problems. What kind of problems? Depression, anger, compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms. Headaches, sensitivity to light. Amnesia? Before Bourne? No. (KNOCKlNG AT DOOR) The plane's ready. There's a car waiting for you. Good luck. No. You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us. (BEEPlNG) Langley pulled an image out of Naples. lt's uploading right now. lt's coming in now. WOMAN: I need clearance. He's not hiding, that's for sure. Why Naples? Why now? Could be random. WOMAN: Zoom in. Maybe he's running. On his own passport? LANDY: What is he actually doing? He's making his first mistake. lt's not a mistake. They don't make mistakes. They don't do random. There's always an objective. Always a target. The objectives and targets always came from us. Who's giving them to him now? Scary version? He is. (BEEPlNG) l emptied it. lt felt a little light. Put it down. Front. Sorry. Old habits. Use your teeth. Word in the Ether was you'd lost your memory. You still should've moved. What do you want? Conklin. He's dead. Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out. So who's running Treadstone now? Nobody. They shut it down. lt's over. We're the last two. lf it's over, then why are they still after me? l don't know. Ever heard the name Pamela Landy? l don't know who that is. Pamela Landy in Berlin. What's going on in Berlin? l don't know. Why would I lie? l thought you were here to kill me. What'd you do? l'm sorry. Did you call it in? Get up. Come on. You have a car out front? The keys are in my coat pocket. But we should. . . What? Go out the back. l have another car.

That's box one. Teddy, that's yours. Got it. LANDY: Box number two. Call it "Prior Connections." l want to rerun all Bourne's Treadstone material. Every footstep. Kim, box three. l want to identify his method of travel. Stay on the local cops. We need a vehicle, a parking ticket, something. Langley's offered to upload any satellite imaging we need. So let's find a target for them. Danny, box four. l need fresh eyes. Review the buy where we lost the Neski files. Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's movements. Turn it upside down and see what we find. Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life with total control for all those years. We should be a step ahead of him. You wanna go home? Find Jason Bourne. (DlALlNG) (PHONE RINGING) Pamela Landy. This is Jason Bourne. Bourne? lt's Bourne. We need 90 seconds to triangulate his position. What do you want? Are you running Treadstone? Treadstone was closed down two years ago. You know that. Then who's planning the missions now? There are no missions. lt's over. Then what do you want with me? Berlin. Have you forgotten what happened in Berlin? (ECHOING) You kiIIed two people, Bourne. MAN: Vladimir Neski. Bourne? l wanna come in. Okay. How do you wanna do it? MAN: We need 35 seconds. l need someone l know to bring me in. Who? There was a girl in Paris. She was part of the program. She used to handIe Iogistics. Alexanderstrasse, 30 minutes, under the World Clock. Send her alone. Give her your phone. What if I can't find her? lt's easy. She's standing right next to you. There's just so many of them, sir.

Shit, he's put her right in the middle of everything. This is a security nightmare. There is no way we are going to get her covered. Call a mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they've got. No snipers. No snipers. You put snipers on the roof and it'll scare him off, and I need answers. You can't really believe he wants to come in. He knows something about the Neski case. And l'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is. Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close. Are we talking about protecting Nicky or killing Bourne? We're talking about killing Bourne. We're talking about the next dead body. lt might be Nicky. lt will be someone. You're not hearing me. Bourne dead gives me nothing. Can I talk to you privately? What? l know how you're feeling. You lost two men in Berlin, and you want it to mean something. But nothing Bourne gives you will bring your men back. Nothing in those files makes their sacrifice worthwhile. You have to let go. We're professionals. When an operation goes bad, we tie it off. lf there's something you're not telling me, l want it now before I send that girl out there. Do you understand? You talk about this stuff like you read it in a book. What do you want to do? Put the snipers in place. lf things go bad, we take him out. You got it.

Last week an Agency field officer tried to make a buy off of one of her ops. He was trying to sell out a mole or something. And? And you got to him before we did. l killed him? You left a print. And they were partial prints that trace back to Treadstone. They know it was you. That is insane. Why are you doing this? Why come back now? Landy will find. . . Just stop. Last week I was 4,000 miles away in lndia, watching Marie die. They came for me, and they killed her instead. This ends now. Find her. What do you people want with me? Why are you trying to frame me? Please! l'm only here because of Paris. Abbott dragged us. . . Abbott? Who's Abbott? Conklin's boss. He shut down Treadstone. ls he here in Berlin? Yes. Did he run Treadstone? Did he run Treadstone? Yes. Conklin reported to him. Please. Please, I swear. All right, what was Landy buying? What kind of files? Conklin. Stuff on Conklin. lt was something to do with a Russian politician. Neski. What?

Release his photo to the Berlin police. And check out his story about the girlfriend in lndia, too. l'm on it. You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela, and you don't have the shoes for it. He said he didn't know anything about Berlin. He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire. Don't you think that was for our benefit? He didn't sound like a man in control to me. We know he was in Berlin. His mind is broken. We broke it. And now. . . What now? Terminate him? You've been pushing that agenda ever since we got here. He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that, too? l'm convinced that Bourne knows something. He knows that you're after him and in the interest of self-preservation you might start with that. Check on those photos. Have they gone out? DANNY: I need to show you something. (BEEPlNG) All right, l finished my box work but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. l came down here last night because none of this is making any sense. l mean, l'm with you. Conklin was a nut. But a traitor? l just can't get there. What do you have, Danny? All right, you put a four-gram Kel on here, it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. There were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one over here, didn't go off. Now, first of all, this is nothing. lt's a sub-line for the breaker above. And second, why put the charge all the way down here? lf you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this. Bourne would know. lt was staged? ls it a slam-dunk? No. But what if somebody were trying to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne? What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this? Show me again. All right. Well, you put. . . (GRUNTlNG) CONKLlN: Pull over. He's getting out. This is not a drill, soldier. We clear on that?

We don't know yet. Landy's upstairs in one of the rooms. She said she'd call you when she's done. Okay. l think l'll take a cab back to the hotel. So the room he checked into was across the hall. Why would he come in here? What are you thinking? l recognize this room from a photo. There was a chalk outline right here around the body of Vladimir Neski. This is where his wife killed him? Do you still think his wife killed him? Guess he got out through this window. We just got word from the Berlin police. They found Danny Zorn's body. l want you two to stay on Bourne.

So we got in the way. ls that why Neski died? ls that why you killed Marie? You killed Marie, the minute you climbed into her car.
