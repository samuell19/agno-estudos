97.1 The Ticket, Valenti and Foster. Big game tomorrow T, downtown, your Lions take on the mighty Packers in what's sure to be another disappointing Thanksgiving day. Come on, man, you can't say that. I can say it because I'm not Helen Keller, but who cares what I think, let's go to the people. 248-539-9797... Boys, tomorrow's Thanksgiving. And let me just tell you, I got a lot to be thankful for. But God dammit, it all starts with you guys. So, if you'll indulge me for just a moment, this round's on me. Charlie P., I've never come across someone who inspires optimism the way you do. Even though the Lions haven't won a playoff game in a couple of decades, you still bet your entire paycheck every September that they're gonna win it all. This year is their year. - I can feel it. - Stop right there. In my opinion, they've got a fistful of rings based on your support alone. America's Guest. Good times or bad, you're always there. Right there in that very stool to lend an ear. I don't think I've ever worked a shift... that you haven't been here for. - So, thank you. - There you go. For being someone that I could depend on. And Earl, I mean, look at you, man. I mean, no matter how bad the economy gets, you're always looking for a better job. - I'm so proud to say that... - Okay, okay, okay, enough. I can't deal with this anymore. Are we at the same fucking bar? This dummy's a degenerate gambler with debts all over town. You know why they call him America's Guest? 'Cause I don't think he's paid for a drink in his life. - It's true. - And Earl's not looking through the Classifieds for a job, he's looking for an escort. What do it mean when she speaks Greek? Anal, for a fee, of course. Oh, I got a credit card. I'll pay for it. I work at the plant, baby, we got good benefits. Why you got to do that? Why can't you just see the good in people? Yeah, why do you do that? Oh, yeah, well, because while everyone's busy blowing sunshine up society's collective ass, it is my job to speak the truth. Think it's your job to be an asshole. You may be right, C.P. Sure, he's violent, crass, maybe even a little psychotic. Yes, he's an asshole, but he's a lovable asshole. - Where are you going with this? - And ever since our freshman year at St. Jude's, he's been there for me. Oh, what happened? These four senior football players tried to jump me. - What they come to you for? - Look at him; I didn't know whether to save him or pile on. It was some initiation thing. They were trying to stuff me into a trash can. Brad came from out of nowhere, tackled two of them, they let go of me, and they kicked his ass instead. Got your ass kicked. I would've taken 'em too, if it wasn't for that 300 pound lineman they had sit on me. Brad, he just finished a 14-year career with Buffalo. - That's no excuse. - Anyway, asshole aside, he's our asshole because he's got it where it counts. And I'm proud to call this guy right here... - my best friend. - Give it up. Give it up for him. Come on, now. Hey, that was really great, okay, seriously, what the fuck's gotten into you? Truth be told, I finally put together enough scratch to put a down payment on a condo. And I'm gonna ask Michelle to move in with me. No, no, don't start that shit. Brad, Brad, Brad! What was our motto senior year? - Kill those motherfuckers? - No! "The time is now." And the time is now. - Buddy, she's the one. - Yeah, but Kev, - I'm telling you... - Will you please stop worrying about me for once, please? Let's talk about you, what about that therapist? It's not therapy, okay? It's a fucking support group. - Get it right. - Okay, well, how's it going with that? It's fine, I guess. Look, I know I have a problem. I'm a happily married man... yet I'm stricken with this great burden of being arguably the horniest man alive, and I've found with a lot of consultation that I can look at other women. There's nothing wrong with that. - Nor should there be. - That's right, man. What I can't wrap my head around is why a hand job is cheating. Because she got a gag ball in her mouth and she squealing. Oh, boy, I... I mean, take tigers for example, king of the fucking jungle. That's lions, but okay. Do they not fuck whomever they want? Jesus Christ, Rachel, are you ready? Yeah. Oh, yeah, have another. - Yup, I know my limit. - Boys, look, I got to go. - What? - I love every one of you. Thank you, and happy Thanksgiving, guys. No, this isn't over, buddy. - Go get her, tiger. - Kev! Come on! Hey, I'll get you money next week. It's a holiday, take an extra day. What the fuck are you staring at, you dirty Mick. You're seeing a shrink?! Fuck you, I am not seeing a shrink. It is a supp... It is a support group! Did you have to get on the little couch? Happy Thanksgiving to you. Ya. ♪ I'm not dreaming away ♪ I'm not fantasizing ♪ There's that thing that's for sure ♪ ♪ That knock on the door ♪ That very look on that face ♪ They call it intuition ♪ Oh, but there's only one ♪ There's no thinking it out ♪ No trace of a doubt ♪ I only know that I'm in ♪ I get a feeling and it wakes me ♪ ♪ Morning light that she makes me ♪ ♪ But knock on my heart, save me one last time ♪ ♪ You open wide and let it all begin ♪ ♪ Love's knocking on my door ♪ Oh, yeah, oh!

Fuck you, I said call Michelle! Michelle, calling. If I wanted to talk to you, I would've answered, silly. Text me, oh, and follow me on Insta. And remember, Michelle loves ya. Hey, asshole, what are you doing? What?! Look at that. What?! Look at that. You don't re-rack your weights, huh? You stupid, smelly, motherfucker! Huh, you like how that feels? You fucking piece of shit! What's up, bro? See you in the steam room, motherfuckers. What? First degree arson? What are you, 14 years old? I caught Michelle cheating on me. Oh, Kev. So that's why you lit a trash can on fire? Was looking at a class one felony if that trash hadn't burned itself out. Oh, he's sorry, Officer. Guy's always been a mess when it comes to the ladies. I tried to say she was no good, but his nuts fell off as I spoke. Yeah, well, there ain't nothing wrong with a little sensitivity; We all go through that. My ex left me... for a Team Six SEAL back in '04. I cried like a bitch for three days. Lost 15 pounds and listened to sad music for a year. That must've been tough fighting crime with a broken heart. Heh, you have no idea. Hey, sign here. Good news is that life gets better. One day you wake up and suddenly that pain is gone, you know? Then you wonder why you cared in the first place. Let's get you out of here, I can't watch a cop cry. How could she do this to us? We were so happy... where did it all go wrong. Dogs with big nuts should have to wear underwear. Dude. - Are you even listening to me? - Yeah, bro, I've been listening to you all day. Kev, I know you're going through some shit right now, but I promise you're not gonna feel this way forever. - It sure as hell feels like it. - Well, you need to go out, you know, lay a couple of fours and fives, and work your way back up. As if that's gonna solve anything. It may not solve anything, but it sure will feel good. Emotionless sex with less attractive women is going to make me feel better? - I don't think so. - Oh, are you kidding me? It's very liberating. You could treat 'em like farm animals. Take out all aggression on 'em. What do you think fours and fives are for? Yeah, I'm not into that. Not into what? Farming? What's up, Brad, Kev? You guys need anything else? Incidentally, Gus, I'd like a saganaki. You got it, princess. Got any tzatziki back there? Maybe I should call her. Yeah, okay, for what, to ask her how the sex was? Kev... listen. We've known each other forever, and you know how much I love you. So you understand when I tell you that Michelle was a piece of shit from day one and you got a front row seat to prove it. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. How could I not have seen this coming? You didn't see it coming, but you saw it when it came, - didn't you? - Dude, does everything you say have to be so crass? Truth hurts, pal. - Jesus. - He can't save you until you die, so until then, you should continue to listen to me. Tomorrow's a new day, a clean slate. It will be fine, I promise. You have one unheard message. First unheard message: Where are you, sleepy head? I'm so sorry to do this, but I won't be able to do our Thanksgiving tonight. - Something came up - -and ouch, stop it. I've got to babysit the neighbor's dog, so let's see each other tomorrow? Happy Thanksgi... Message deleted. All right, since you're bound to lose 10 or 15 pounds anyways, you might as well take advantage of it, okay? Come on! Hah! - Brad! - Yeah? - Brad? - What? I need you. - Great spot. - Yeah, of course. - You get any sleep last night? - Yeah. I guess. At least it was in your bed and not the couch. - Thanks for that. - Don't mention it. I've been thinking about our conversation last night, and... I really think it'd help the healing process if you started to meet some women. I told you... can't think about that shit right now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Kev, I get it, okay, but look. Take her for instance. She's kind of a dumpy broad, but, you know, I bet she'd be fun. - No thanks. - No thanks, what? I never said marry her, she's probably dying to get laid. Yeah, well, I'm not. Oh, there she is. Ass like an Irish setter. Who says that? Hammer time! What's going on, man, you good? I'm great, man. Break anybody in half today? Oh, you know how I do. Hey, it's my buddy Kevin, Kevin, this is the Hammer. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. All right, dude, good to see you, baby. - Happy Thanksgiving, pal. - Hey, you too, you too. - Calvin, pleasure. - Kevin. Yeah, whatever. Man, what's that guy, like an MMA fighter or something? Neighborhood pharmacist. Why do they call him the Hammer? 'Cause his dick's bigger than your arm. This is fantastic. How do you do that again? Oh yeah, that's it. So, how's Liz doing? Liz is good, she's at home right now fisting a turkey. She's awesome, man. You really hit the jackpot. So, what are you doing today? - Nothing. - Why don't you come to my place? - Thanks, but I'm good. - What?! Come on. I'm just... I'm just not in the mood. You're not in the mood? You'd rather spend Thanksgiving alone in your apartment beating off with tears in your eyes than at your best friend's house? I don't think that I'd be much fun right now. Kevin, you, like, haven't been much fun in a couple years. Just come over. All right, I'll think about it. Come on. You want some smoothie? Just come over. - Come over! - All right, all right. I'll come. Thank you. Oh, that's the ticket. - Well, hello there. - Hi, how was the gym? Gym was good, yeah. - Honey... - Yes, honey? - Could you give me one second? - For what? Hey now! To get my hand out of this turkey's ass? That's my girl. All right, guess who's coming to dinner? Sidney Poitier. No, who the fuck is that? Really, Brad? - Kevin, I invited Kevin. - Oh, fun! Oh, that's good. I haven't seen Kevin and Michelle in a while. - That's great. - Yeah, unless she's coming with somebody else, she won't be attending. They broke up?! Sort of, she cheated, he saw it, he's crushed. No, when did this happen? Yesterday mid-day. Oh! My God, that's terrible. - Yeah. - What a fucking slut. I love it when you talk that way. Well, I'm glad you invited him, he shouldn't be alone right now. Uncle Bruce and Aunt Marc and Larry and Margret will be here. And he'll have a good time. Yeah, um, in other news... could you do it for me? I don't have time for this. - Just, please, come on. - I don't have time, - I'm in the middle of cooking. - Liz, it's once a year. Yeah, you like that? You like the way my ass tastes, Paulo?? No habla inglés. Oh, don't stop, oh, fuck me. Oh, yes, fuck me, fuck my ass. Fuck me! Oh, yeah, stick your fingers in there. Oh, give me your fingers. Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Oh, oh, fuck me. Don't lick my ass anymore, just fuck me! Fuck my ass, fuck my ass, Paulo. - Kevin? - Mom! Happy Thanksgiving, Market Square shoppers.

The weak grip on the flowers, your slouched posture, your head hanging low, it screams heartbreak. - It's that obvious, huh? - Might as well be carrying around a jar with your nuts in it. I can take you over here. - Thanks. - Yeah, okay. - Think about it. - Be nice. - Hang in there. - Thanks. It's gonna be all right. Here we go. ID please. Thank you... Kevin. So, any exciting plans for "we stole your land" day? I'm just going to my friend's house. Mm, sounds fun! Flowers for the lady, I assume? Uh, no, never assume, actually. Really? Hi. No, no, no, they're for my friend's wife. - Oh! - Yeah, that's... I'm not. I mean, a handsome guy like you come in here - looking at me. - How about you two queens exchange numbers and move on? - I got places to be. - Easy Sons of Anarchy. We are finishing up. $19.95, please. Want change? - Keep it. - Okay, handsome. - Have a good Thanksgiving. - You too. You're such a bitch sometimes, Harvey. - I'm a bitch? - Yes, you're a bitch. What happened last night, you were supposed to call me at 8:00 and you didn't. My phone died. Sorry. I told you not to call me Harvey in public. - It's Beast. - Beast? I'm not a princess. - Kev, hey! - Hey. Come here. How are you? Oh, we are... we are so glad you came. - Um, where should I put this? - Yes, ah, they're beautiful! Thank you, thank you so much. Uh, Brad, Kevin's here! - There he is. - Here he is. - So, what now? - Well, it's Thanksgiving. Let's go in the kitchen, act like we're helping Liz, she'll kick us out, we'll be watching the game in no time. Sounds good. Um, hey... So, I was thinking about calling Michelle. You know, maybe she just had a bad moment. A bad moment? You call getting popped in the ass on the same couch you two used to cuddle on... a bad moment? I'm sorry, you're right. Larry and Margret should be here soon. - Who's Margret? - Girl he's been banging, says he really likes her. - Good, good for him. - "Good, good for him," don't give me that gloomy Gus shit, come on, man! A lot of guys would kill to be in your position. What? Seeing their girlfriend bent over with another guy? Right. No, I'm talking about being good looking, single, and living in America. Hi, hi guys! - Happy Turkey Day! - Hi, Lar, how are you? - Hi, um... - Margret. So nice to meet you. Thank you so much for having me. You have such a lovely home. - You're so beautiful. - Thank you, thank you. Welcome. - Where are the guys? - Brad and Kevin are in the kitchen pretending to help out. Uh, go ahead, grab a drink, I will be right there. Do you have any idea what would've happened if this shit went down in Qatar? You'd be riding through the desert in tears on your camel, and she'd be getting stoned to death in the town square. Hey, hey! - What's up, bro? - Good to see you, Brad! - You too, man. - Yeah! Hey, Kev, how you doing, man? I'm... I'm good. I'm okay, man, you know? You sure about that, man? Your energy feels a little off. - I'm all right. - His girl got mid-day cock from another man, but he's on the mend. Oh, no, in the middle of the day? So sorry. Let's talk about something else. Oh, this is Margret. Margret, this is Brad and Kevin. It is so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. So handsome, yet so debonair. It's really nice to meet you too. Thank you! What the fuck does debonair mean? Hello! Oh, shit, ladies, welcome. Did someone say "gobble, gobble"? - I think you've gobbled enough. - Cute, Brad. - Thank you for having us. - Hey, Bradley, where's Liz? I wanna show her something with the turkey that I saw on The Chew this morning. Will you stop it? Not even here a minute and he's already trying to change things. Hey, I'm Marc, nice to meet you. - Margret! - Oh, that's funny. Hi, Marc. Oh, Bradley! Okay, hey! All right. - Out of my kitchen. - Oh! What'd I tell you? Let's watch the game. Okay! Let's put this... She's heavy. - Wow, this looks amazing. - Thank you, thank you. - Okay, who wants to say grace? - I'll do it! Wow, nobody's that quick on the draw. - She loves to say grace. - It's true, I do. I used to always say grace for dinner back in Iowa. - Oh. - Iowa? No kidding. All right, let's go, grace it up. Oh, just gonna do that. We're doing it. Dear Lord, we gather here today grateful. Grateful for love, and life, and nature. Thank you for protecting us, and keeping us safe from criminals and diseases, and for giving us the gift of our sexuality. Are you fucking kidding me? I want to thank you on a personal note for Larry. I love him so much. And I can't wait to show him just how much again later on tonight. Oh. And then... Um, I want to thank you for Liz and Brad. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have left the house this week. And for Bruce and Marc. Even though they're gay, they are so sweet. And that's all we can ask for nowadays. And thank you for Kevin. He seems nice. In the Lord's name, we pray. Amen! That was so beautiful, baby. Yeah, that was really something. Pass the fucking beans. Cheers, everyone! Ah, cheers. Happy Thanksgiving. Do you want a drumstick, take a bite, take a bite! Oh, Roman times! I don't want that. Stop. Mannequin is one of my favorite movies. Mannequin one, not two. Oh, my God. "Oh, guys, I'm Margret, blah." All right, get off now, you're embarrassing me. I'm just trying to have fun. Okay, by the way, I hate to bring it up... - Oh, stop it. - No, don't tell me to stop it. Take our picture, do you have your phone? Guys, by the way, cute couple picture. - Chin down. - Ugh, Kevin, you're so sweet. Why are you still single? Higher up, though, higher up. Angle from higher up. Higher up! Bruce, could you put a little more corn pudding on there? Unbelievable. You straight guys eat as much as you want. Us gay boys are always watching our figures. Bulimia. It's 'cause size doesn't matter to us, right, Kev? Oh, that's what Liz said. - He's lying. - But you did. - Where's the bathroom? - Oh, I'll show you. It's right this way. Hug the wall, sweetie, hug the wall. So, Lar... - When did you guys meet? - A couple of weeks ago. Wow, that's fast. What can I say, man, she's great. I mean, when I first met Margret... I just knew. Knew what? You're beautiful. You're capable. You're sexy. She seems so family-orientated. Yeah, I mean, she's gonna make a great mom one of these days. Ha! I would make love to both of you. She's amazing in bed. - Oh, nice. - Wow. Not nothing. Motherfucker! Good for you. Oh, you, with this shit. You never know, Kev, I mean, things may end up working out between you and your ex. Yeah, yeah, you never know. Listen, motherfucker, it's over. - Brad? - What? No, he's right. It's pretty over. Oh, baby. There are women lined up around the block for a handsome guy like you. Men, too. It's okay. Yeah, what is with you guys and the word "handsome"? When exactly did things go wrong? When he asked for her phone number. It's called a one-night stand for a reason. - Oh. - Oh. Guys, I can't believe it. - Oh, my God. - Really? Everyone's gonna see you naked. Not a big deal, just my boobs. - That's the spirit. - Yeah, yeah, I'm proud of my breasts. You should be, here's to them. They're a supple reminder of my sexuality. Want to see, Brad? It's fine, it's fine. Thank you for that. Margret, would you like more wine? No! Oh, okay, well, I'll get... I'll get dessert started. So AJ Brock is now on the bench. We heard that he was iffy coming back. And it's Franco and DJ Smith in the middle. And this one's picked. Same old Lions. - This game sucks. - Yeah. I can't even remember the last time the Lions actually won on Thanksgiving. Hey, man, Lions on Thanksgiving is tradition. Yeah, tradition of losing. - Let's do shots. - You see that? - Now we're talking. - Yeah, I don't really think... Kevin. So... what's your poison? Uh, do you have Jaäger? Let me rephrase that. Would you prefer whiskey or tequila? Tequila! She loves tequila, makes her crazy. ♪ La cucaracha ♪ Kind of figured that. So, anyway... What was the name of that website you were featured on? Oh, yeah? Let's drink to that. Salut. - Woo! - I didn't need that. Oh, it's a party now. So, uh, how exactly did your pics end up - on that site anyhow? - Oh, my ex, Nehisi, had some topless pictures... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck is his name? Nehisi. Your ex is a Canadian? No, he's not from Canada, he's black. Wow, Lar, you know about this? I mean, I've seen you naked, bro. Following that act must be like throwing a baseball bat into a closet. Oh, no, dude, it's not at all. Okay, well, since we're on the topic, are there any other minorities you've been with that we should know about, chin, landscaper, sand? - Dude! - What, Kevin? They've only been together for a couple of weeks. Lar deserves to know. You are so racist. I'm not racist, okay, I hate everyone equally. He's just joking, baby. Yeah, I'm just playing, I'm sorry. Okay, if you say so. Good, moving on. I bet you two have weird sex. Hell yes, we do. I love it when you make me squirt. Oh, yeah, let's talk about that. Oh, man, you would not believe it. You'd be amazed at what I could believe. I can squirt ten yards. - Yeah, I think I'm gonna go. - Sit the fuck down, Kevin. That's bullshit, you can't squirt ten yards. Yes, I can, I can squirt ten yards. No, you cannot squirt ten yards. Yes, I can! Ten yards, that's a first down. You can't squirt a first down! Yes, I can, tell him. Um, well. Whose side are you on? What, baby, I'm on your side. Well, then tell him. It goes pretty far. Yeah, but Lar, come on, okay. We're not talking about third and inches here. - This is fourth and long. - Okay, I'll show you. No, no, I don't think that's a good idea. You are letting this asshole make fun of me. You're making me look like a fucking liar. Baby, babe. Don't! I'm sorry, guys. She's just really sensitive about this stuff. Don't be sorry, man, it's all right. She's just expressing herself is all. So are we gonna do this bag of blow or what? - You guys have blow? - I knew it! Oh, no. Larry, wait! Where's the blow? Hey, wait... Lar, wait up. - Are you all right, bro? - Look, I'm sorry, man... she just gets a little out of hand when she gets going. Hey, hey, hey, never, ever apologize for a special gift like that, okay? She's just a free spirit, that's all, like a fucking unicorn. - You think so? - I know so. I don't know, I haven't known her that long, I just... Well, it doesn't take much. - You're right, man. - Get in there. - You're right. - Be a fucking athlete. - Let's do this. - Be the man she needs you to be right now. Here I come, baby. Come here! I'm sorry, baby, let's show 'em what you can do. What did you say to him? That's not important. This is gonna be awesome. You are one of a kind, Lizzie. I'm gonna need to get this pumpkin pie recipe. I'll e-mail it, Mom taught me how to make it. - It's so good. - Thank you. By the way, what is the deal with that Kevin? So handsome, such a downer. Yeah, lighten up, it's not that bad. He's just going through a tough time. Yeah, I can see that, but get over it, P.S. He's sensitive, I don't know. I'm sure with a little help from his friends he'll be fine. Anyways, I wonder what they're up to. Ah, ah. Come on, Lar, be an athlete. - You can do it, baby. - Right, right, left, left. Oh, dude, this'll beat front row at a Gallagher concert. - I think I'm gonna go. - No way, you need to see this. Come on, baby, I want my first down. I'm trying, I'm trying, man. It usually doesn't take this long. Well, get your shit together, all right? Don't want to put you in half time for Kevin. - Shut up! - Sorry, sorry, man, too much. - Give them some encouragement. - Come on, you can do it, guys! Dude, look how pink it is. Yeah, I know. I think I should be leaving. - No, you shouldn't be leaving. - Yes, yes. We're not done till we move the chains. I don't think we're gonna move the chains! Come on, get your knees up! High knees, let's go! Hey, Lar, give her the Kit Kat! - Oh, yeah. - What the hell is the Kit Kat? What's wrong with you? We don't have time to get into that. Come on, Lar, snap that fucking bean! Ah! - Touchdown! - Woo! We fucking did it! Woo! I love you. Yes! Oh, they're fine, they're just watching the game. Must be a good one. Hmm. She's a little kooky, right? I didn't notice. She's got gout in her vagina. - Stop it. - Well, she is disgusting. - That's a little over the top. - Listen, let's be clear, you know she blew an eight ball in your bathroom? - Stop it. - What do you mean stop it? You didn't see it up in her nose? Okay, by the way, I'm glad I'm the only one that noticed that. Are you high? Stop it. Stop squashing me, Bruce. You're always squashing me in front of your niece. It's, like, not fair, then she thinks... Stop, do you need more wine, are you guys good? Oh no, I think I'm good on the grape. Was she in the fucking circus? - That was awesome. - I know. - You all right in there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just got hit with a tidal wave of cum is all. - Larry, is she dead? - Oh, no. It just takes a lot out of her. I got to get Liz on this program. Kev, open up. Did we make it? Oh, first down, baby. I'm going home now. What? You can't leave now. Put me in, Coach. See, she's just getting started. Brad, I'm soaked in cum. I'm going home to shower. You can't leave, where's he going? Oh, it's all right, oh, there we go. Margret... You're a very talented woman. - Lar, it's been real. - Good to see you too, Kev. - Next time. - Keep your head up, man. - Where's he going? - He just got shaken up on the plane, don't worry, he'll jog it right off. Lar, you guys are welcome to spend the night here. For that matter, you can stay here for the rest of your lives. - Thanks, man. - Kev! See you at Christmas. - Kev, wait up. - What? Look, dude, I'm sorry you got sprayed, okay? I thought she was talking shit, didn't think she could do it. Yeah, neither did I, but, clearly, she can. And she did it all over me. And I'm a little emotional about it. Look, dude, I get it, okay? I know it's somewhat degrading when someone cums in your face, but society's changed. Straight guys take it on the chin sometimes, too. Oh, you're pathetic. Tell Liz I said thank you. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Kevin, wait, wait. Okay, hey, stop. What do you say we go to your place, get you changed up, and go paint the town? I've seen enough painting for one night. Kev, look at me. I need this as badly as you do. How so? Because one more night of Bravo and girl talk with Liz and the queers, and I'm gonna start wishing death on people again. Please. Come on, man, just say yes. All right, all right, fine. You're not gonna regret this. Be right back. Ladies. Babe, I got to talk to you. I wish I was Liz just once so I could teach him a lesson. Me too so he could teach me one. Kev's in bad shape, okay? I think seeing you and I and Margret and Larry and Bonnie and Clyde over there got him down a little bit. So, look, I was just thinking maybe I could take him out for a while just to cheer him up, you know? You are ridiculous. Shouldn't you be with your family? Babe, I'm with my family every day, okay? He's my best friend, I want to make sure I'm there for him in his time of need; I can't send him home with his head down like this. It won't be a late night, I promise. What about Larry and Margret? Oh, they're all fucked up. I think the tryptophan in the turkey got to 'em a little, think they're in for the night. Really? Pshhhhh. Yeah, okay. Okay, just don't make it a late night. I promise you I won't. - I love you so much. - Okay, I love you. Guess who's going out? - Have a good night. - I'm sorry Where are you going? Just taking Kevin out for a bit. - Can we come? - Yeah, that's a great idea. You guys never hang out. - Really? - Why not? - Yeah, why not? - 'Cause we're gonna go do, you know, guy shit. You probably wouldn't be into it. Need I remind you I played three years varsity football. - You did? - Yes. I was a tight end. How did I know you were gonna say that?

Besides, your friend said your head's been up your ass since some bitch broke your heart. He said all that, huh? Yeah. - So what happened? - I showed up to her place around noon, and instead of my usual warm embrace, I caught her with another guy. Whoa, okay, that's pretty fucked up. How long were you guys together? Two years. She fuck you on the first date? What did you expect? Look, Kevin, you seem like a really nice guy, and there's nothing wrong with that. So she's fucking other people right now. It's fine, sometimes that's just the way people like to get down. Supposed to make me feel better? 'Cause it's not. No, it's to make you realize you can't count on people to live up to your expectations because they never will.

Someone just tweeted me a picture of Ray Charles as a referee... - No, no. - In the end zone. No. Let... let me, let me start out with this, okay? Everybody knows what happened, but I want to just express... my feeling on something, because my... We've been Waitin' for it all night. My anger does not even... How about this, on the list of anger... the refs don't come in first and neither does the football team. My anger lies with the Lion organization. Okay? Owners, your CFO, CEO, your GM, your head coach, and any player who matters. My anger lies with them because here's the one guarantee I can give you... I can't guarantee whether the Lions win or lose. We know they lose most of the time. But I guarantee you that no matter how the league bends this franchise over, no matter how the league spits in your face, no matter how the league openly and forcibly... disrespects you, you will say nothing. Your quarterback? Forget about it. Your head coach? Forget about it. I'm not even convinced he knew the rules on the sideline. Did he go crazy in the post game? No. And here's my biggest complaint. This is a day where we as fans, you as fans, can do nothing. You can get angry, spin your wheels, scream and yell, whatever you want. The only people that can say things that will make you feel better or possibly effect change... are the small group of people that have consistently, over the course of the last 55 years, said nothing. And that's your ownership and your management. Because what frustrated me most is last night was the time where if that happened to the Dallas Cowboys, Terry said it in pre-show, Jerry Jones would have robbed a church of their pulpit. Yeah, he would have stolen the pulpit and put it up and said, "Come over here..." Everybody come here, I want to help you. Right. You the fans deserve better in this regard. Your team sucks. And for whatever reason you still care. You deserve better. But understand the league does not respect you. The league does not take the Lions seriously. Because all the league has done consistently... is defecate on you. Whether it's the Calvin process, the Dallas playoff game, the Pollard touchdown, they... all they do is spit in your face. And your ownership says nothing. Thank you, may I have another? And the league will continue to do this to you because they don't care about you, because you don't matter. You're a non-entity, you're a joke. And you'll get treated like that. And it's gonna happen again and again and again. That's the problem I have. I can tell, but here's the thing. I don't even like this team! - I understand, Mike. - But I'm disgusted because these poor bastards that root for this team, they don't get anything! They show way more emotion than the team. And again this team gets boned. Boopadoo.
