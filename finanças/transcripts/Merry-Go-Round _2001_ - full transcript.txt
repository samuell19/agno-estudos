This is my dad. My dad loves to cook... and he aspires to be a good chef. My name is Old Kuk. Being on the defensive is a major strategy in business. There is no such thing as speedy returns. One has to be patient. Defence buys time for the return of the principle sum. With the return, profit can be attained. With the profit, you will be on track. After being on track, you'll be listed in the stock market. This is my elder brother, Kuk-Fung. He always says... Once a gangster, forever a gangster. This is an irrevocable truth. He always says things that I don't understand. But, I know he loves me. I am Little Cocoa. I am clever and understanding. Everyone loves me. I love to eat and sleep. I wish to be an inventor when I grow up. Chapter One: Startling Move. Is this the one? Pay back or go to hell. Dad, the street looks so... quiet here. Dad, let's go in. Impressive, Dad. You have found a good catch. I have been looking around for quite a while. Stop bragging! A two-month rental contract provided with all the utensils. With a bit of furnishing... The Kuk Assorted Noodle Shop can start business next week. Everything's fine. Renovation has to be done anyway. Cockroach! Don't panic. Everything's okay. Dad, it's not okay! What is it? Help! Watch out! Who are you? Be careful with the ladder. It is broken. Who are you? My uncle used to own the shop. The guy who has run off? I used to work for him here. What do you come back for? It is a mess here. I thought my uncle acted like a crook. So, I came to see if I could help. I also... wanted to check out who is the unlucky person. Spill the beans. What else is wrong? What was that? Who has turned on the toilet valve? The sewage pipe always leaks and floods the toilet during peak hours. Chapter Two: The Grand Opening. The Grand Opening Welcome to the grand opening of The Kuk Assorted Noodle Shop. Thanks for coming! Please enjoy. Stop it! Congratulations! Take a seat. Kuk-Fung! Congratulations! Stop that! What's the matter? You are so cute. You are so handsome. I knew that. As your girl, I am so happy for you! Who is this supreme ugly pork chop? Pork chop? Yeah, pork chop! —I can help you prepare pig blood. —Help me with the pig blood? —The pig blood is busy! —She is Lady Brace. Lady Brace? Why is she here? She likes my brother very much. She likes your brother, then he must be very lucky. I'd rather stay here and wait for you. You should go home. Just go! No, I want to stay. Come on! Just go! Just leave! I am watching you from here. Four steps forward. And then one step backward. Backward for what? Are you nuts? Go down, come on... On your mark! Get set! Go! Bye! Am I far enough? Keep on running! Do not turn back! Go! Don't worry about our feelings. Just tell us the truth. Tell us what you think. How is the food? Do you like it? What do you think? —Oh no! —What's up? What's the matter? I forget to make a call. What's up? Got it... I am sorry, I have to go. Let us talk next time. I have to pick up my daughter from school. —Goodbye. —Goodbye. You are leaving too? Why don't you eat more? Do you like the food? I am in a hurry. —You just came here. —I have to go. My boss needs me. Thanks a lot. Bye! —You just came here. —Please come back! They will be back for the noodles! The washroom is in there. I have to go. —You have to go? —Yes. —So what do you think about it? —Are you sure you want to know? Yes. —First, the soup is cold. —Boil it a little longer. —Second, it is too expensive. —It can be cheaper. Third, the food is awful. Awful? How awful is it? It's about this awful. I don't get it. Now poop is this awful. Your noodle is about this awful. Have you eaten poop before? Forget it. It's okay. At least it's better than poop. Auspicious beginning? It ends as soon as it begins. In English, beginning is the end... Uncle, congratulations! Is the party over? It ends that early? You loudmouth! How dare you curse at our business? We just start doing business today! What's in your mouth? It stinks! Can't you see? It's beef offal. Who are you then? Sister, this is Kuk-Fung... Uncle Kuk and Little Cocoa. Hi! This is my sister, Heman. So you are Kuk-Fung. I am so disappointed. I beg your pardon. I am the one who is disappointed. What is "disappointed"? It means let down. I think Dad is the most disappointed. The Kuk Assorted Noodle Shop. Cheap but good. Just twenty-two dollars each. Wanna try? It is very good. The Kuk Assorted Noodle Shop. Cheap, but good. Why do you take it if you do not want it? The Kuk Assorted Noodle Shop. Cheap, but good. Cheap, but good. So this is what you called "New Flavour"? What do you think you are doing? If you are not going to eat here, then get lost! You are so rude. So this is your "service"? Mind your own business. Listen, I have a bunch of buddies. I am really scared... You are so uncivilized! Aren't you educated? Are you doing your job? You're scaring people away. You blame me when I am helping you out. Can't you see? These people just criticize... or passing by without even looking at us. With your scary look... no one would ever eat here even if they have to starve to death. Why don't you do this yourself? Take it! Don't you like noodles? Yes, I do. Flat noodles, pig skin, fish ball, leek and pig blood. Bingo! We like exactly the same thing! What a coincidence! Fifteen dollars each, right? —Yes, please come in. —Have a seat. Have a seat. Two noodles. No, just one. One? Got it! You like chicken wings and sausage. Does it taste good? Eat slowly. Don't stare at them like that, okay? How is it? Do you want some Satay sauce? Yes, please. Enjoy yourselves. Thank you. You are welcome. The food is great, Boss! Have this sausage. —No, you like it more. —Come on. Check please. Coming. —How much is it? —Fifteen dollars. Be careful. Dad, why don't you give them one more bowl? I cannot do that, sweetie. They will be unhappy. Remember the kid has checked out the price before. Obviously, he wants to make sure that he can afford it. Had I not taken his money, he would have felt insulted. We call this dignity. That kid got backbone. Do you follow me? It's so difficult. Of course, only heroes like your dad can understand. Besides... the portion was much more than usual. So clever! Of course! Come on, try the fish balls. How is it? As good as abalone? Very chewy, right? So chewy that you feel like bouncing up and down? Chapter Three: For Love and Heroes, There is No Origin. Locust, time for school! Hello! Granny, these cartons have been stacked here for quite a while. Nobody needs these junks nowadays. I have my reason. Every now and then, some people will ask for these "junks." When I grow up, I will open a carton factory for you. I am not good at managing. Concentrate on your studies now. Or else you may not be able to take care of yourself. I will go to your workplace tonight. You want to eat noodles again? But it is expensive. Seldom can we find it so cheap. Didn't you say you would open a factory for me? I know you will. Okay, I will take you there again this Saturday. Carlily! You again? —What do you want? —I'm not looking for you. Nobody would marry a loudmouth! You're really obnoxious! How could you be so rude when you talk to me? Don't you have any manners? Manners? What's "manners" in English? Why should I tell you? Don't be shy to ask if you don't know. Oh, as if you know. It's "Civilization." Give it up. Pass over the phone. She is out. You want to play? Aren't you the one who came for the noodles yesterday? Aren't you the guy who cleaned the table for us? Wanna join? I love to watch. Watch only? Sit down. Dad, this is my friend, Locust. Your friend? Come on in. Have a seat. Carlily, I called you this morning and your sister picked up. She is unbelievably difficult. More difficult than winning in video games. She is like this. But she loves me very much. Even so, she does not have to go that far. Let's go out. I cannot. Your dad pays me to work here. Dad. I have to take our "staff" out for a while. You are not helping here, and yet you are going to take her out? Dad, I am the boss' son. It's my right to flirt with the staff. Besides, there's nothing to do here. How could you play all day long? What about your friend? Right... He likes your noodles, so he would help here without getting paid. Sounds great! Bye! Bye. How can he help? The reason why I started this business... is to make Fung stay here more often... instead of wandering outside. You should not have talked to Uncle Kuk like that? What's wrong? What did I say? Locust. My name is Little Cocoa. Which grade are you in? —Grade Four. —I am in Grade Three. Why are you still wearing school uniform in the summer break? That is none of your business! Check please! Fifteen dollars please. Just dump the bowls there. Put down your schoolbag. —What's up? —Nothing. —Let's have an IQ quiz. —Okay. What is the first thing Santa Claus puts into his socks? —Presents. —No. —Toys. —Wrong. —Cockroach. —Wrong again. —Christmas tree. —No. —His feet. —You are quick. I saw Locust at the video game centre this morning. He is quiet, but he looks like a profound kid to me. So I took him in. There is a saying that goes like this... "For love and heroes, there is no origin." What are you talking about? Don't you get it? I do. "For love and heroes, there is no origin." Last night when I saw Locust and his granny... sharing a bowl of noodles together they seem to be so pitiful... and yet very affectionate. So it reminded me of this saying. Forget it. I don't think you can understand. Neither can my sister. My turn. Someone throws darts at a gorilla, and he catches them by hand. Why does he die in the end? A gorilla catching darts? Right. Let me give you some hints. The gorilla is very happy. —What? —The gorilla is happy, and so? What? I feel itchy here. It is very difficult. Come on, tell us the answer. The gorilla catches all the darts and he is very happy. So, he is like... and he stabs himself to death. Stabbed to death! Come on and finish the food! Forget the stupid questions. Why are you still up? Come on, go to bed. Brother, our business is getting better now. We have a few customers. Just a few? Darn! Dad will soon go bankrupt. Do you think Dad is a little bit weird lately? He is just being career-minded. You won't understand. Where did you go with Carlily? Are you two dating? You know what dating is? Dating is kissing. You grew up really fast. Of course not. She is... a bit weird. Just like Locust, who is also weird. I had a good time playing IQ quiz with him today. Playing is a lot of fun... but besides that, she seems to be so bewildering. I do not know what is on her mind. It seems that she is not my type. How about Locust? Can he help? He is far more diligent than you. He works fast. I can also be fast if I want to. Fast enough to scare you to death! I am dead! Super Curry Chicken! Here are the forks. Don't use your hands! Yummy! Get it? You like it? Try some! It's yummy. You have eaten? No, I haven't eaten for nearly two days. I don't know why I'm not hungry at all. Two days? Are you nuts? No. Then why don't you eat? I don't feel like it. Are you on a diet? What? Do I look fat? No. Why don't you eat then? I said I'm not hungry. You can't quit eating just because you don't feel like it. Everyone needs to eat. I've already warned you last time. How could you keep on starving? Why are you so angry? Anything wrong? Chapter Four: None of Your Business. Carlily, please. Don't you know what time it is? Did you check the clock before you call? Listen up! I'm getting very mad. Just get out of my way and tell her to answer the phone. Just a minute. Sister, it's for you. You got a minute? Can we talk? Did you take a bath and have all your stuff done? Great. Why didn't you eat today? I have told you. I don't feel like it. Because you are too busy or what? You can't choose to eat or not based on your mood. You can't quit eating just because you're not feeling hungry. I know what you mean. But while working, I don't know... Just not feeling hungry, so I don't eat. Are you so busy? Are you so career-minded? I said I understand! You're nuts! Not eating is no fun at all. Why are you so angry? It is your fault. What's wrong with you? It's none of your business. Then I'm sorry. Goodbye. The least offensive, yet most heart-breaking phrase ever exists is... "None of your business." Good morning, Uncle. Come with me. We have to talk. What's up? I am sorry about last night. I should not have blamed you for not eating. What I am trying to say is... I am very fastidious. Pretending not knowing each other in the shop... just does not work. Obviously... I... I am busted. In other words... I like you. Do you get me? I like you. It is a plain fact. Now, what about you? You have two options. You either like me or not. But I think you actually like me. What does that mean? Helping each other is a good attribute, right? What do you think? Then, what do you want? Are you fooling me? Cut to the chase then. Just tell me what's on your mind. Do you love me? Do I love you? Do I love you or not? I think... I love you. Why don't you set it straight? Still not explicit enough? So, why don't we... —Date? —Okay. You are indeed wicked! I felt so bad that I could not fall asleep last night. Neither could I. It's fatal attraction! Hey! Can you two sit on one side? Must you hold hands? Wait a minute! Let's see how much we weigh. Weigh? Who said I'm afraid? Then go ahead. —Hello! Sir! —What is the matter? I have something to tell you. I love Carlily! Will you do anything for me? Of course. Carry my handbag for me, I have to go to the washroom. How can a guy carry this in public? You have put on some weight. Not me, it's you. No knowing how to swim is not a shame. I can be with my girl even if I cannot swim. Peek freak! What? Only a peek freak will come to the swimming pool and not swim. Should I put on or lose some weight? You have white hair! Proof of maturity. Let me pull it off for you. Stop it! You have a pimple on your back. Don't you dare do that in public. It's okay. Let me squeeze it. Get off me! Don't run away from me! Don't run! Let me help you! Only if you can catch up with me! Let me help you! So shallow? You do... Okay, I can't swim. I didn't mean that. I was referring to your scar here! That's a mark of manhood! I also have a birthmark here. —Really? —Let me see it. I can't see it clearly. Come on... Do you have any more on other parts of your body? Get off me! Carlily, you are undergoing an adventure. Notes are hidden everywhere. The next note is close to a very hot place. Go ahead and search for it. I love you, sweetie Piggie. Very hot? Carlily, what are you doing in the kitchen? Nothing. I have found what I need. You're smart. You are my sweetest Piggie. I miss you. I love you so much. The next one is under Little Cocoa's stool. Miss you everyday. Did Little Cocoa write this for me? There you are. Are you looking for notes? Here's another one. Chapter Five: Rubbish. Locust! Look! I have found many jeans. And glasses with cases. The shop nearby must have closed down. How lucky for me to find so many things. What is this? If the weather is fine tomorrow, I will take these out... and see if anybody wants them. Granny, it is a flute. It is dirty. Don't put it in your mouth. Cocoa. Locust. Haven't seen you for a long time. Locust, I had a lot of fun in the music contest. I have a lot to tell you. I made a pretty album with Miss Choi. I have something for you. This is beautiful. Thank you! Try it. It is clean. —Good morning! —Good morning, Carlily! Morning, Locust. Morning, Cocoa. Carlily, I haven't seen you for quite a while. I made a pretty album with my teacher, Miss Choi. Really? Show me. Come over here. It looks great. You are unbelievable! Who is this? This is Miss Choi. I like it. —It fits me. Give it to me. —No way. —Come on. —No. Locust. Receive your medal once again. Congratulations! Not again. Haven't you had enough with the mirror? You have looked into it for the whole night already. You won in the music competition? What's so great about that? Just a piece of junk. Don't listen to him. Hurry up! It is pouring! There's so much rubbish here! It stinks! Rubbish! Who has put on weight? You or me? Look, how come this one is particularly light? Really? Let me see. They are almost the same. Check it out. —Cut it out. —No, this one is even lighter. Really? Maybe it's because your hand is lighter. When we save up to 1000 pieces, let's go to Japan together. Why 1000 pieces? Isn't it just a matter of money? If you want to go to Japan, I will pay for you. Brother, why is Dad acting so strange... after the competition? God knows. Nothing to do with me. Cocoa. I want to buy you something. Do you like this? I don't need this. How about this one? I said I don't need it! I did not ask for presents. Never mind. Just pick one. Why buy me a present? Just pick one. I don't need any! —How about this? —No! You must like this. You got a lot of money? Never mind. Just pick one. I don't need it. —Please. —No. —Come on. —No. —Come on. —No. I don't want presents. I only like to play IQ Quiz with you. I'm sorry. —Locust. —What? Buy me ice cream. —Sure! —Let's go. Granny. Kiddo. —Granny, let me massage you. —You are so sweet. This is exactly the same as the one you cleaned the other night. Thank you, Granny. Sweetie. Locust, come over here. Let Granny take a good look at you. The collar is worn out and the shirt is too small for you. You have grown a lot. You need to get a new uniform next semester. Remember, do not run around in a new place. You have to listen to the warden, got it? Locust, stop that. Don't your hands hurt? Here are some photos. Keep them. Or else, you will forget what your parents look like when you grow up. I don't want them. Locust, come on, keep them. I don't want them! Round Chapter Six: Fight Club. My sweet Piggie. Idiot, who is your Piggie? What's up, pervert? Where did you take my sister? Are you jealous? You don't have any date? Cut it out! She has diarrhoea! What did you guys eat for dinner? How come? You are dead! Hey! Open the door! Open the door! It is you! Go away! —I have to see her! Open up! —Just leave! Stop banging! —I won't leave! —I will call the police! For what? She is my girlfriend. Open the door! Pipe down! You shout even louder than I do. —My sister has fallen asleep. —So what? I have to see her! —I said she is sleeping. Stop it! —Open the door! —What are you doing? —What? What did she eat? Nothing special. Stay away from me! Don't you know that she is weak? Did you take her to the doctor? Get lost! You dare to hit me! You are nuts! That's enough! I don't beat women! —Stop it! —Come on! What happened? —I didn't see anything. —I didn't see anything. Come on. Are you satisfied now? I was just worried about her. You should have let me in. She is my sister. I am also worried about her. Hey, she is my girlfriend. I have to go. I will come back tomorrow. Do comb your hair. Hey, your arm is bleeding. Your house is next to the race course. Do you bet? Of course, and we have won a lot of money. Or else, we cannot afford to live here. —You are kidding! —Thanks. Come on, have some more. Another horse? Were you born in the year of the Horse? Don't you know Carlily is a "merry-go-round" expert? What are you looking at? Right move! Cover it up. I don't want to see it. Stop looking! I am looking at this, not that. What are you doing? Playing with goldfish. Don't torture them. Have you ever seen lions jumping through fire rings? —Yes, I have. —Then check out Kuk's famous... goldfish jumping through fire rings. Stupid, put it down. Sister, come here. What is this? King of Street Contest? Testing how well you know about street culture? The winning group can get 1,000 dollar fashion coupon. Plus two return tickets and accommodation in Japan. It sounds okay. The winning group can get a glamorous prize. What does it mean by "group"? A group is made up of two people, you dork. Right, why don't you two go? —With him! —With her! No way. Just look at her. Come on. Give me a hand. What? You are familiar with street culture. If you win, I can go to Japan with Fung. Oh, I see. This sounds more reasonable. Fung, get more sleep for the competition tomorrow. I am okay, sweetie Piggie. You go to bed first. I will be up for a while. Good night. Wait a minute. Give me a kiss. No way. Let me show you. I have goose bumps! You go to bed first. Pass the phone to the pervert. I have to talk to her. Good night then. Sister, Fung wants to talk to you. What is it this time? How do we write the expression "hea" (laid back) in Chinese? No written form. We can't write it out? Why? It means fiddling around. So it is? What's street drawings and writings in English? —Graffiti. —How do we spell it? God knows. Okay, bye. What's up? Which cell phone needs the tempo first before the melody input? Choosing the tempo? Model N. I got it. The three stripes of Adidas' Super Star... is red-blue-red or blue-red-blue? Blue-red-blue. You sound very tensed. We call this steadiness with progression. Progression with caution. You got a good rhythmic sense. Of course. Better go to bed. Same to you. Mr Kuk-Fung, better be smart tomorrow. This is the first time you address me with respect. I am scared. I am shaking too. Did you have any sleep last night? A tiny bit. I could not sleep even after watching the late night show. Impossible. There will be so many people watching us. You are right. Honestly, you are a good sister. You will not get anything for yourself even if we win. I am not that crazy for Japan. I'm only afraid Mom will not let Carlily go with you. This is much better. What? You look better when you behave like a girl. It is none of your business. This works too. A little flirting makes you more charming. Don't worry. Be confident. We can make it. Welcome to the King of Street Contest! I am your host today. Hello! Let me tell you the prizes we have to offer. The winners can fly to Japan... to experience the essence of Japanese culture. It is time to introduce the three teams. We have Au-Yeung-Pui-Yee and Ng-Hin-Wing in Green Team. In Red Team, we have... wow, our hairstyle looks alike... Kuk-Fung and Heman Pang! We have twins in Blue Team. The elder sister is sitting next to the younger one, and vice versa. Mona and Liza! I hereby announce the contest has begun! First question, list five words that we use to tease people. Red Team. Dork. Dope. Pig-head. Foetus. Nerd. Bingo! Let's move to the next question. Those who always curse are not virtuous at all. On Nike shoes named "Frog"... which national flag is embroidered on the back? —Blue Team. —Puerto Rico. Bingo! Fifty points! It is time to look at the demonstration. Now pay attention to his steps. Our question is... Who created the move "windmill" that you just saw? Green Team. Mr Crazy Legs in Rock Steady Crew. Wonderful! Fifty points! They are getting more competitive. —Takehiko Inoue. —Hiroshi Fujimoto. Devil Style Crew in Tsim Sha Tsui. —Black Knight. —White Ice. Six. Let's Go! Inachu Pingpong Club! I am getting so nervous. Let us check out the score. Green Team, 850 points. Red Team, 900 points. Blue Team, 100 points. This is nerve-racking. Red and Green teams are so close. This is very exciting! But only one team can win! Thank you. Who will the winner be? Last two questions. What do we call in... English the drawings and writings on the walls in public areas? —Green Team. —Graffiti. Correct! They should have gotten that one. Both teams are tied at 900 points. —I am so tense! —Cool down! The last question is the key. No deduction in score this time. You'll win if you know the answer. I am freaking out. Leave me alone. Last question. In the Japanese drama, "Beautiful Life", when... Takuya Kimura and Takako Takiwa visit the amusement park... what animal do they ride on in the merry-go-round? Green Team. —Rocking horse. —Rocking horse? Wrong. You can answer, Red Team. It is... Piggie. Piggie? Piggie is correct. The answer is a pig in the merry-go-round! The "King of Street" is Red Team. Congratulations! Congratulations! Finally, we have a winner. The champion of the King of Street Contest is... Mr Kuk-Fung, whose hairstyle is similar to mine. Congratulations! Not to mention his charming girlfriend, Heman. You deserve it! Congratulations! Chapter Seven: Trigonometry. Sister, you will only take one backpack? I will only be staying there for two days. I will not take such a large suitcase like you do. Otherwise, how could I buy plenty of Japanese snacks for you? Do keep your promise. Sister, I am afraid that Mommy will know our secret. Don't worry. Just remember we have to call Mommy at the same time. Sister, I am really fortunate. You are the one who grant this trip to me. Grant? I am not Holy Mary. Just remember to take care of yourself. Do not ever rely on that guy. Though he is goofy... when it comes to emergency, his inner power would emerge. Inner power? Is he a superhuman? What for? I will just be away for two days. No more than thirty-six hours. Why so generous? In case of emergency. This is a parent's responsibility. Listen. You also have to be responsible. Do you get it? So that you would be responsible for others as well. Do you follow me? What are you getting at? When you go to Japan, you two better stay in two different rooms. I got it. You know the meaning of playing it safe, right? It is the prerequisite of all happy endings. Better be safe. Point well taken. Read you loud and clear. You better go to bed. Alright. Good night. You have to work tomorrow. Good morning, Uncle. Good morning, Little Cocoa. Have fun! Take good care of her. Bye! Take good care of my sister. You better take care of yourself first. Take care. Bye. —Bye. —Uncle. —Come on in. —Okay. For a thirty-six-hour-trip, why bring such a big luggage? Forget it if you don't want to help. There is everything here. Coke, soda... beer and ice cubes. Instant noodles. They even have socks here! Whiskey and con... Condoms. Do you want to buy one? For your sister. 401. 402. 403. I will wake you up at 8:30. We will set off at nine o'clock sharp. Have a good sleep. I wonder if I will be so happy that I can't fall asleep. The feeling is mutual. Good night. Japan! Hi, son! Dad, I've landed. Is everything okay? Yes. —How about Carlily? —She is here. Do you remember my advice? Had I wanted to do it, I would have done it already. I am glad to hear that you did not do it. I have told you. Safety is important. Safety. I got it. Is Heman there? You want to talk to Heman when you're travelling with her sister? Tomorrow, my boyfriend, Kuk-Fung, and I will take the JR Rail... from Shinjuku to Ueno... to see my favourite merry-go-round there. What's up? Still alive? It is a bit chilly in Japan. Take care of my sister. It is a bit cool. Better go to bed early. You have to run around tomorrow. What are you doing now? I'll call her later. Do you need anything? I would not expect anything for a one-day trip. I knew you love Japan. Who would not love Japan. Everyone loves Japan! How do you know? But yes, we are on the same page in that regard. You don't believe me? I will show you. Show me? You are not here yet. Fung should not have talked to Uncle Kuk for that long. That's odd. It has been an hour. What if... No way, it could not be. That means I am not even one year older than you. Now you know. You have been acting as if you were an adult already. Especially when you look so small. You are right. Your room is so messy. Is it that bad? Fung, your blanket smells. My blanket smells? Are you are in my bed? Right, it stinks! Why do you sniff at my blanket? Hey, I have to sleep in your bed! —Get some sleep. —Talk to you later. We are now going to Ueno. I've to buy gifts for Little Cocoa, Uncle Kuk, Locust... and, of course, my beloved sister, right? We have arrived, Fung. Come on, wake up. Listen, no more sleep! I watched the door closed at Ueno station. Fung was still sleeping. I didn't wake him. He's sleeping really soundly. Have you ever been to Japan? The railroads there are not much different from those in Hong Kong. The truth is Japan is not that unique. Fung was sleeping really soundly. It looked as if he did not sleep at all last night. Did you want to come to Japan with me in the first place? Why weren't you thrilled about it at all? Yamanote Line is a roundabout. We got on the train at Shinjuku. Without knowing when, we came to Shinjuku again. I passed Ikebukuro and Shibuya a total of four times. The same for Ueno. Every time we stopped at Ueno, Fung was sleeping. I stayed on the train with him every time. The phone of your home was engaged for the whole night. Your hotel room phone was busy as well. Were you two talking on the phone? For the whole night? No longer do I... want to ride on the rocking horse. Chapter Eight: Merry-go-round. Sister, tell Mommy that we did not go anywhere. Why? Nothing. We just didn't go anywhere. He kept sleeping on the train. I'm sorry. I didn't buy you anything. Why is the bill so expensive? It is the bill for long distance calls. Heman talked to Brother for a long time that night. Why didn't you let me know about this earlier? It looks like I no longer have to worry what I fear most. Something worse has happened. Boss, your curry is wonderful. Sir, you have good taste. Curry is our specialties. You surely know what is good. I will come again. —Curry is my favourite. —Great. But the place is a bit too quiet. I cannot help it. If you like it, eat more. You may not have another chance. Why? I was just transferred here. It is not your problem. It is mine. The shop may close down. What a pity. I agree. Hey, is it you? Where is your beloved girlfriend? You two broke up? Carlily, this is Fung. Carlily... I'm sorry... I have only talked to your sister on the phone for one night only. I admit that I had a little feeling. Now I know I am wrong. It was only one phone call. Nothing happened after that. Please trust me. It was a valuable trip. But I slept for the whole trip and did not go around with you. Fung, let's split up. I'm sorry. I'm bothering you. Bye. Sister... I'm sorry. I have only talked to him on the phone once. I did not expect it would end up this way. Do not be angry at me. What? Dad. There are things in this world that the mere thought of them is wrong. Then why bother? Just forget about it. Just do it! Just like typical Hong Kongers, keep going at it day and night. What do you want to do? When I married your Mommy... I already knew she had a fatal illness. But, I loved her very much. You know... she's so beautiful. We had no fear. We gave birth to you two, knowing that Mommy might die very soon. Just like why I opened this shop. I insisted on it even knowing we only had two months. What are you getting at? Success is not the only motivation to do something. Just do it, if you want to. There's no success unless you make a move. Without perseverance, you are doomed to lose. Try your best. Listen. There is nothing in the world which is everlasting. Think about it. Ready. Ready. Smile. Smile more. Ready. One! Two! Three! Mr Kuk. Granny, you bring Locust along for the noodles? Come on in. —Have a seat. —Thank you. Please accept this. You are very kind, but keep it for yourself. No, it's my thanks to you for taking care of Locust. He has helped us a lot. He is a clever kid. He helps out because he likes your noodles. I know. I will go back to my hometown next week. I do not know when I will be back for your noodles again. You're welcome back anytime. I have been missing my sisters a lot lately. So, I know I have to go back. It sounds right for you to go. But how long will you be away? Locust has to go back to school next week. Yes. Do not cry. The orphanage is a great place. I'll have many friends over there. I can come and visit you during holidays. Do not cry. Please stop crying. Please stop crying. This is Fung. Sorry for calling you this late. Have you thrown away our album? I know you must have kept one ticket. The very first one we measured our weight together. I know you cannot part with it. I am now downstairs. Could you leave me alone? I do not mean to make you come down here. When I look at the album... I feel really sorry. Forget it. I slept for the whole trip in Japan. You sat there with me for four roundtrips. I know there is nothing I can do to compensate your pain. I owe you four roundtrips. I regret to owe you anything. I will run four laps here. After that, I will leave. Please don't! I mean it. I'm sorry. What happened to you two? He is back. Don't be angry at him anymore. You love each other. Why do you have to do that? I don't love him anymore. Yes, you do. Sister, I am exhausted. I'm sorry. You didn't do anything wrong. Neither did Fung. He is back again. Go down I know you love him. Why don't you go down? I don't know. I am confused, Sister. Don't cry. Stop crying. Don't cry anymore. He is really exhausted. Go down. Go down. Go down. Come on. Take this with you. Go! Stop crying! Go! Chapter Nine: The End is the Beginning is the End. This is for you. It's beautiful. Thank you. I have one for you too. Thank you. Dinosaurs have 1,000 teeth? Don't you know why dinosaurs got 1,000 teeth? It is a difficult question. Do not think about it now. Start thinking about tonight. If you can't figure out the answer, call me. Shall I call you every night then? When you know the answer, you won't have to call me anymore. All accounts closed? All done. No gain with minimal loss. So, how much have you lost? Come on, tell me the exact figure. It's not important as long as we are happy. How are you with Carlily? So and so. Nothing much. Then what? No gain with minimal loss. So, tell me the exact figure. Happiness is more important than gaining anything. Gain? After having these super noodles... the shop will be officially closed. Thank you. Uncle. Can I have the noodles as well? Of course. I will get you one. Uncle, thank you. Come on, eat. How is it? Locust, after this meal... you will have the strength to face all difficulties. Carlily, you are a good girl. A rare breed these days. Keep this up. Cocoa, you have become the smartest in IQ quiz. Even I cannot answer your questions. How about you? What? How about you? Spill your guts, Dad. You know what I'm getting at. Uncle's noodles are getting better and better. —Right, they are good. —Smart kids. I'm glad I don't have to eat any more of this from now on. I beg your pardon. We have had enough of pig skin and turnip. Come with me. Where are you going? No way. This is so stupid. It's not your style. It's not stupid. Look how cute it is. Come on. Sit on it. —Close your eyes. —Why? Close your eyes first. Now brace yourself. Close your eyes. You are riding on a rocking horse in a merry-go-round. You have just passed... a cotton candy vending machine. It is now... haunted house. And now, we're at the Ferris wheel. A huge Ferris wheel! The next stop is... toilet. And then we return to... the cotton candy vending machine. And once again the haunted house. Now back to the Ferris wheel again. It stinks, is it the toilet? You are right, it is the toilet.
