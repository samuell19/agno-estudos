[MAN LAUGHING MANIACALLY] SHELBY: God. How long have I been out? About an hour. Where are we? ROB: We just crossed the state line. - Really? - Mm-hm. Already? Mm. Why do I smell food? ROB: There should be a girlie toy in there for you. SHELBY: Thanks, sweetie. - Yeah. Jesus, Rob, slow down. You're driving over a hundred. - I've got a really good convoy going here. - No. Just slow down. Now. Thank you. Look... ...okay, I know we had a shitty weekend. I wanna get home too. But let's just do it safely, okay? No more bad luck. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Oh, I got the spot. "I love you too, Shelby." I love you too. I do. I'm wide awake so get some sleep. - Okay. Thank you, sweetie. ROB: Mm-hm. [TRUCK HORN BLARING] Ah. Bingo. - Hey, you knocked out another hour. - Ugh. I only feel more tired. Are you tired yet? Nope. I cannot believe you started another one. I didn't. - This one found me. - Oh, whatever. Look at the speedometer. It's like 12 miles over the speed limit. The other one, you were right. It was too fast and unsafe. - This one isn't. - Oh, please. Seriously, there's like an art to a good convoy, babe. It's like a conversation between us and the cars as we drive. We communicate. No, did you see that? That's him warning me that there's some slow cars up ahead... ...so we're gonna have to pass them. Oh, that's pretty considerate. Oh, see, now this is what I like to call a brake pumper. You think speeding's dangerous, try driving behind this guy. Okay. At this speed, I'm fine with it. Just don't go faster. ROB: Oh, right on. I was wondering when they were gonna need to fuel up next. Well, what do we do? Are we supposed to introduce ourselves, say hi? I don't know. I mean, I've never actually met anyone I've been in a convoy with. [TRUCK ENGINE DOWNSHIFTING] [TRUCK BRAKES HISS] BERT: Sure am glad we all had to stop. Hey, I'm Bert. - Rob. - Rob. - Hi. - Oh, nice. You a Robert? Or a Roberto? Ha, ha. No, I'm just kidding. Ha. [SIGHS] - Hello. So where you headed there, Rob? ROB: Uh, Cincinnati. BERT: Oh, you're kidding. It'll be nice to have some steady company. - Yeah, you bet. Yeah. BERT: Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Uh, well... ...see you inside. - Sure. Yeah. - Kids want their chocolates. [BOTH CHUCKLE] All right. [CHUCKLES] [CASH REGISTER DINGS] Uh-oh. Looks like someone got the munchies. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah. No, I'm just messing with you. Anyway, uh, I was talking to this trucker inside. Not very chatty guy. Anyway, he said he got on his, uh, radio-thingy. Said the interstate up ahead's pretty wall-to-wall. ROB: Mm. Really? - Hey? Trucker on my CB says it ain't moving worth a damn out there. Told me a way around it, though, so... ...you're more than welcome to swing on in behind me. Come on. I could use the company. Road's a lonely place when you're traveling solo. Yeah, you got it, man. Hey, thanks. No problem. [SIGN BUZZING] [TRUCK BEEPING] What'd you talk about? Oh, the interstate's jammed up ahead so we're gonna go around. - Yeah, and Mr. Lonesome up front there... SHELBY: Uh, he's not alone. Yeah, he is. That's what he said. Rob, he's not alone. There's a girl with him. I saw her. Misunderstanding then. It's no big deal. You sure we should be doing this? Would you rather turn around and crawl up the interstate? It's like a parking lot. SHELBY: No. Guess we're fine. Great. It's the sticks, Shelby. People hunt out in the sticks. There, see? Did you see that? - What? - In the window. Get closer. There is someone in there. [WOMAN SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] SHELBY: Hello? Hello? - Can you hear me? - What the hell? You get his plates. You get his license plates. - Shelby, come on. - No, just go! Get his plates now! Go! - Just hurry up! - Okay. SHELBY: Okay. BERT: Is she okay? Is she alive? SHELBY: Yeah. [TIRES SCREECHING] [LOOSE GRAVEL RUSTLING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [WOMAN COUGHING] - Get her up. - There she is. There she is. Okay, she's back with us. SHELBY: Lift her up. - You keep her coherent. I'll be right back. WOMAN: Keep him away from me. - Oh, I will. It's okay. He threw you from the truck, but he took off. You'll be fine. No, I jumped. What? [CRASHING] [CAR ENGINE HISSING] [GRUNTING] Shelby! Shelby! Are you okay? What happened? He... He... He came back. I know. I know. Where's my girlfriend? He took them. He took both of them. Both that lady and your girl. What? BERT: He took off over there. Lift me up. - Help me up. ROB: Yeah. Okay. Okay, come on. [PARKING BRAKE ENGAGES] BERT: Wait, wait. Yeah, okay, all right. - You let me go. - You're hurt. I'll go. Shhh. Just please promise me... ...you take care of my family if something happens, okay? [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] TRYTON: I don't know where I am. No, no, I was taking her to rehab. Don't know. Accident. Maybe she jumped.

But, I mean, we're not even sure that Cat went anywhere near that place. She's my best friend. She doesn't do anything without telling me. And the last person that saw her is staying there. I mean, come on, Dan, she hasn't called all day. That never happens. Can't you just use your badge? Lise, I work for the Health Department, okay? Not the police. My badge is useless. Look at that place. I mean, can't you make something up just to get in there and see? Just to see if she's in there. [BELL CLANGS] DAN: Hi there. MAN: I'm sorry, I can't help you. All of our beds are full tonight. DAN: That's all right, sir. I'm actually... I'm from the Health Department. Just need a moment.
