He's sorta like a buddy. "Sorta like a buddy." Yeah, done some shit with him. Seemed pretty cool, right? Right. So I started gettin' closer to him, he starts to trust me. One day he takes me into his basement and he's got this little moneymakin' operation. What kind of moneymaking operation? Moneymaking. Making money. Funny money. Counterfeit. That shit's never any good. What can I get you? Yeah, let me have a cold beer, would you, please? Sure. There you go. Four dollars. There's your change. That's all for you, doll face.

I was startin' to tell you about this guy I know. "Sorta buddy." This "sorta buddy"... Wants to move this pile of cake immediately, like now. So I got this other guy I know from the street, name's paco. Done some shit with him. Same kind of shit you done with your "sorta buddy"? Mm-mmm. Different buddy, different shit. Shit. Anyway, a few days ago I breeze one of these showgirls by paco, same way I did you. Told him there'd be more if he could get me a buyer. He finds some cats who will do a million clean for four million dirty. This guy you know from the street. Yes. Paco? Yes. Stay with me. Here's the craziest shit of all. While my "sorta buddy" and me are tryin' to put together the deal with the money cats, he starts gettin' all fidgety. So we hide the cake. Then, later that night when he's in his basement... Makin' up the last batch of greenie, some strange-talkin', sick motherfuckers dressed like bug men... Come strollin' in. They fuckin' put the squeeze on his Jimmy with these bad-ass pliers, then make off with a million dollars of the fakies. My "sorta buddy" goes ape-shit, busts up all his equipment, then calls me from this bar cryin' about his dead dick. Then later that night he gets dead. Something sharp and pointy found its way into his belly. Laid him open like a bluefish on a dock, and the next thing you know, ol' jed's a millionaire. So, where's the money now? I got it, and I still got paco. And his people trust you, the money looks good? Everything is cool, baby. Great. Now what? Now I need you. Oh, hop. It's always a bad ending with you.

You gotta run your hands through some of that cash. You get that greenie stink on your fingers, you'll feel a whole lot better. - I know how it feels. - Now I do too. This is my turn, Frankie. This money is gonna give me the opportunity to be legit like you. Maybe start a business, you know? I-I could invest it or something. Right now I don't feel very legit. You never bothered tellin' me you had a brother. What did you tell him about me? I told him just enough so he didn't ask any questions. I gave him a couple bucks for helpin' me out. He's cool. Here's 5,000 bucks. Get yourself some transportation. Nothin' flashy. Just make sure it's got a trunk. We gotta do somethin' with that money. How far down on your list of somethin' to do with that money is spendin' it? It's not on the list, hop. For now, we should just be cool... And lay low. Later on we'll split up the money, find another buyer. But for now, we do absolutely nothing. You're takin' all the fun out of bein' a millionaire, Frankie. Trust me. The fun'll come later. Go get yourself some wheels. Fine. But I'm gettin' one of these next week. Come by the club later. Hey, take your time, Colleen. I might as well be looking through time magazine here. The odds are probably as good. The one who did the shooting was different than the rest of them. There was something about him. Do you remember anything specific, anything special about the guy? He had long blond hair and he wore it back in a ponytail. His eyes were cold blue... And he had a very, very strong presence. Excuse me. Colleen, I think you know detective knapp. He'll be in charge of Danny's investigation. Do you have another detective that can work this case? Hey. Danny was a cop. That means he's my brother too. The captain and I got the whole department fired up over this. You recognize this guy? Yes. This... This is the little one. Punk's name is hopscotch. Danny was on to him. Don't know his real name yet. Just a small-time hood looking to make the score of his life. Unfortunately for Danny, he tried to get in the way of that. I figure this hopscotch rat has crawled deep inside some hole, but I'm gonna flush him out. What about the f.B.I. Agents? F.b.i.? The other two men that were killed. Danny said they were FBI agents. Danny said that, that they were feds? Yes. What? What's wrong? They weren't f.B.I. Agents. Just a couple of street punks. Anyway, captain, these guys left a pretty clean trail. Blondie might lead us to hopscotch. But it was the blond guy that killed my brother, not this hopscotch. Nothing's more important to you than bringing your brother's killer to justice...

I been thinkin' about the ways to spend this money, but none of it sounds as fun as it should. There's this girl I used to see... real sweet. She really dug me too, but I had to keep samplin'... had to be hop. Saw her at the store the other week. Mmm, mmm, mmm. She still had it for me. It's like, I let some go and now I got all this money, but what's it good for? You gettin' me? Yeah, but what about jeaneen? - Jeaneen's married, man. - Thou shall not commit adultery. Then I think to myself, she's the one who's married, so she's the adulterer. Hop, you got a point there, but you might have a problem with the one... "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife." He ain't my neighbor. Fucker lives in norwalk. Anyway, I'm gonna let jeaneen go. Gonna find that little gal, ask her out on a real date before my Karma goes to shit. I'm fuckin' hit! Aaaah! I'm here for you, hop! Stay with me! I got you, hop. Hop? Aaah! Uhh! Ohh! Oww! Marty? You killed hop! Frankie? I didn't... I didn't know, man. You gotta help me. My arm... Bullshit! You shot your own brother. Is all that money worth it to you? Huh? Who you workin' for, Marty? Answer me! Who put you up to this? Frankie, we can talk about this. You got a smoke on ya... Ohhh! Frankie, man, I loved my brother, but he got caught in the wrong scam at the wrong time. It's all very unfortunate, but you know it and I know it. It just comes with the territory, man. Frankie, there is a... there's a whole lot of money out there, man. We can just... We can just split it. "We" is not gonna do anything. You are gonna tell me who your partner is, and I'm gonna listen. I can't... no. Ohhh! Aaah! Ohh. Fuck you. Okay. There's a... There's a... there's a pager number in the car... And a... a cell phone. Better hope he calls back. You lookin' for some money? You know what I'm talkin' about. You know who I am. Now I know who you are. It's time for us to have a talk. Well, little buddy, here we are. Used to say you weren't gonna make it to 30. Well, you did. You made it. And a little more. Damn it, hop. I probably never told you this... You're my best friend. I hope you know that. I had to tell him, man. He's kickin' the shit out of me. A mutual acquaintance has some disturbing things to say about you. It hurts, Vic. Man, it hurts bad. - That ought to kill the pain. - That was dumb. - He was a piece of shit. - He was a piece of shit. But he also knew where the money was. You'd have killed him anyway. So, where is it? Out there. You want the fast way to the money, you probably shouldn't kill me. Gimme the rest of the money, keep 50 grand, I forget I ever saw you. I'm not gonna let you enjoy spendin' that money, pal. Tommy "hopscotch" Hopkins. Did you even know the man? Your little runt partner? No, but thanks to my snitch, Marty, I knew he had the money I wanted. How hard was it to get his own brother to kill him? Don't be stupid, asshole.

It might get better. - You murdered my brother. - What? - I saw you. - Saw me? Kill who? Paco. His real name was officer Danny whitley. He was my brother! Paco? Paco's your brother? Paco was a cop? The beach house. I was in the hallway behind the door. I saw you. You had his blood all over your face. I didn't kill your brother. I saw you. I saw you with my own eyes. No you didn't. Because I didn't shoot him. The guys he was with shot him. You're lying. You'd say anything to stop me from killing you. You're right. I would. But I'm not lying. We were going to do a simple money transaction. From the moment I walked in, I knew something was wrong. All of a sudden, one of the guys who was with your brother... Pulls a gun on him and blows him away. While the other guys start shootin' at us. All I was tryin' to do was stay alive. You got the wrong man. His own people killed him. I never shot anyone who wasn't tryin' to kill me. Now, if you still want to shoot me, you have to pull that back first. If what you say is true, then why did those guys kill him? I don't know. What do you think? I think he was set up. Double-crossed. I remember the expression on your brother's face. He never saw it comin' until the last second. I'm sorry. Nice piece o' ass, huh? Did you screw her? The desert get too cold? Hey, I'm talkin' to you, pal. Did you screw her or not? Did you fuck her? I see. You're a cool guy, huh? Okay. Good. What did you tell Colleen? Oh. You know her name. Yeah. What you don't know is all this girl's trying to do... Is find out who killed her brother. You wouldn't have any idea who that is, would you? Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna give you $100,000. You're gonna give me the rest of the money. Why would I give you four million dollars... For a hundred grand? 'Cause I'll fuckin' kill ya before I let you screw this up. Like I give a shit. Let me get this straight, okay? I have a lot of money. Yeah. You have none. That's right. Not only that, I know if the money's in the dining room or the conservatory, and if colonel mustard is screwing miss Scarlet while they're counting it. You don't have a clue, do you? Let me ask you: Who's winning the game, daddy? You're a dead man, pal. - Where were you tonight? - I was at a strip club. Oh. Why? Because I, unlike others, intend to do something about my brother's murder. Oh, you do, huh? So, what did you do, Colleen? Did you walk up, introduce yourself and say, "hey, oh, I'm Colleen. Did you kill my brother?" I tried to get a job as a dancer. Oh, now you're Angie fuckin' Dickinson, huh? You're gonna get yourself killed. Danny was in too deep, look what happened to him. Stay out of this. Or maybe you're falling for him. Don't be an asshole! He's a killer. He said he didn't do it. Oh, he did. Oh, well. Then I'll just walk down to the police station and strike him off the suspect list. I'm gonna say this one last time, Colleen. Stay away from him. Got it? Can I come in? I think I know who arranged for your brother's death. The only question is: How does he know you? What are you talking about? Right after you pulled away last night... Bad guy number two shows up. He wants to know what we talked about. And he refers to you by name. Dark hair, drives a blue sedan, about my height, good-looking guy. Vic? So you do know this guy. Yeah, you're describing Vic knapp. He's the detective in charge of the case. He's a cop? Well, he's one dirty cop. That's impossible. I know him, we... How well do ya know him? We were lovers. Perfect. That can't be true. Vic's not capable of doing something like this. My best friend is dead because of this Vic. Now, how did he explain... The guys who killed your brother? He said they were street punks... And Danny thought they were feds. Street punks aren't that slick. They were professional assassins hired by your friend Vic to do us all. Danny trusted them because Vic told him they were FBI. I searched their pockets. They had no ids, nothing. Just this. It's part of a map with a phone number. This is Danny's neighborhood. It's also the main number of the switchboard for the downtown precinct. There's no question, Colleen. Vic's your man. I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him! Colleen, there's only one way to bust this guy. We have to go over his head. His boss, his name is Evans, Evans, okay. Let's call Evans in. Colleen! I need you to call Evans. This is what you're gonna say. Fifty-fifty. Sure. About a mile past king's canyon. Three o' clock. Just by the taco stand. Ah, detective knapp. We were just talking about Danny's case. Plenty o' leads, no one's talkin'. Look, don't worry, I'm on it, all right? I don't have to tell you how important this case is, do I? I want it resolved for the department and for detective whitley's sister. Is that clear? Yes, sir. All right, where is it? Down there. Down there. Yeah. Not a bad hike for buried treasure. Why don't we leave these up here? You know how money changes people. Occupational hazard. Anything else? That's Frankie's car. It's just a little bit further. Why is Frankie turning himself in? Because he didn't kill Danny. And he thinks Vic's involved? Yes. From the very beginning it was all Vic. Well, maybe Vic's letting Frankie lead him to the money so he can arrest him. Then why didn't he inform you, his own captain? He's out there without backup. He's dirty, captain. Start diggin'. Our partnership's gonna last about another 20 minutes. You're gonna have to work your half. Uuh! You okay there, soldier? What the hell is the matter with you? Uuh. You could of killed me. Yeah, I did put a little too much wrist in my swing. I think you leaned into it at the last second, though. I thought we had a deal. So did I, until I discovered this pez dispenser strapped to your ass. You know, this is a funny gun for a cop. The serial number's ground off. Were you going to shoot me with it? That's Vic's car. You wait here. I'm gonna go. No! You stay here. Let me handle this. Put a little zip in it, will ya? Oof! Ooh! - Where're you goin', Vic? - Evans. You're a little late, cap'n. Our boy's just down there. You've got some explaining to do. What are you doin', Vic? You goin' into business for yourself? - Look, captain. - No. You look. If it hadn't been for your... - Brainless ex-girlfriend, you would have gotten away with it. - Vic! Uuh! Uuuh! Uuh! He was my best detective. Captain Evans, I don't know how to thank you. One way or another, neither of us were meant to leave the desert alive. What happens now? Well, the way I see it is: These two gentlemen got into a little dispute over some money. Both of the greedy fellows took a bullet. It's not quite the o.K. Corral, but then neither of these guys is Wyatt earp, so... I expect it'll do.
