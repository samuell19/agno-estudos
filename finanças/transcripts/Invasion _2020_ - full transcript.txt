The worst tragedies in human history always occurred when we encountered something unknown, something scary. Today a rare, cosmic phenomenon can be observed in the capital. An unknown flying object was discovered. 477, left, at 10 a.m. - Understood, we're in visual contact. Well i don't want to push you but it may take 50 years for stars to fall from the sky again. I'm climbing. It's huge, 650. I'm watching it. An object has entered the atmosphere from the west. Now it is a bit more north. Many have come to watch the starry rain. Sweta was left there alone. Repeat, 477. - It is huge! Humans have waited millennia for contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. A catastrophe occurred in the Moscow district of Tschertanowo. An unknown object crashed into apartment buildings. The death toll has yet to be determined. Experts are reluctant to confirm eyewitness accounts that all of this looks like an alien invasion. This is war, isn't it? - Depends, on how they continue to behave. "Who are you"? We can't just wait and see after what they did. If they weren't, everything would be normal. And Sweta would still be alive. Leave it there! Julia! - What do you mean by that? Left! Julia! Have no fear. 30th 00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,750 We don't know their intentions. And now our most important task is to keep the risk of an open conflict as low as possible. This is a unique opportunity for all mankind. He saved me. I owe him something. An opportunity to understand ourselves better. To find out who we are. I always knew you weren't like everyone else. The adjustment is not yet complete. The transmitter is made of kinetic material, you will never be able to remove it. Roger that. We are prohibited from contacting you. We cannot allow you to access our technologies. Gratitude. Loneliness. Love. You need love and hate to overcome the fear of death. If there is no death, then there is no need for love and hate. You love him, don't you? - Yes. - You left me for him. They are not what we thought they were. You are better than us, Tjoma. This is our earth! Don't come closer, otherwise everything will be over. Sol will blow up the spaceship. We all die! You and we, do you understand? What are you doing to her? I love you! Julia! What are you doing to her? What are you doing to her? Hakon should exist forever. But he passed his life on to her. Now we have to check the results of the mission. Our common future depends on this. People say that they can no longer live as before. And me? I definitely can't. "But it would be an empty universe indeed if it were not for the people I love, and who love me." Axis alignment five degrees to the right. - Roger that, right. Switch off engines. - Roger that, switch off. 314, you have reached the calculated trajectory. Test? - Test positive. Leading research institutions are carefully working to decode the alien technologies left behind. Scientists predict an early breakthrough that will not only strengthen our country's defense capabilities, but will also produce new instruments for areas such as medicine, energy and shipbuilding ... Despite a UN recommendation, Russia has refused to to allow foreign experts, which led to a further extension of economic sanctions. In order not to repeat previous mistakes, special units monitor the so-called deep space around the clock. The satellites are controlled by specialists from the Air and Space Forces. The deputy commander, Lieutenant General Valentin Lebedew, was appointed head of the department for countering extraterrestrial threats. A fundamental decision was made at the Shanghai summit: the option to destroy an alien object if it poses a potential threat to the earth is allowed. The countries, who have the means to attack an enemy in nearby space, i.e. Russia, the US and China, have signed corresponding protocols. We don't quite understand yet what happened in Moscow two years ago. But thanks to our joint efforts we can say with certainty today: Whoever visits our planet will not go unnoticed next time. Usko, what's up? Have you seen a shark again? Not as a whole. Just a fin. Such an idiot. Usko! What is it this time? Usko! Chara! Where are you going? Chara! Where are you Chara? Chara! Where are you? Chara, where are you? There is basically no difference between human and artificial intellect. With the exception of the constant emotional background that we see as our individual character traits. When we say "I feel something" we actually mean that we see a solution but do not understand the algorithms that led us to this solution. The thing is that we don't have to understand everything. Is there any news from the laboratory? Any progress in the investigations? This information is top secret. If I tell you about it, my guards will shoot you. Intuition is not a wonder, but a carefully thought-out strategy. Vitalik's lucky in that he still doesn't understand a lot. But why "Vitalik"? He would have been named after you, Maxim, if you had shown more vitality, hadn't slept during lectures, and invented Ethereum at the age of 19. Excellent. Thank you, Vitalik. I know what you're thinking about me now. Chara would have bitten his leg off. Maybe Chara will show up again ... Vitalik is now calibrated to believe that every physical touch means recognition, whether you caress him or hit him. This is called "restricted perception". Again. No artificial intellect can be better than man, because man is the ideal artificial intellect. For now. You are our future. And unlike us, they will be practically immortal. They may even be able to have feelings, because feelings are the inevitable consequence of the increasing complexity of any system. However, we will be able to dock your unwanted emotions through appropriate protocols. And us? - What about us? Can you dock our superfluous emotions? So we keep wagging our tails even if we get hit? Theoretically yes. By stimulating or inhibiting certain parts of the brain. Don't kid yourself, Julia. We are not much different from them. And so mechanisms will be able to feel sympathy and antipathy, hate and love in the near future. We overcome fear of death with love and hate. If they don't die, why should they love? Damn it. Don't they annoy you? Who? - Them. Oh, the guys who run after me in formation 24 hours a day? No of course not. Listen, Julia, I ... I have to tell you something ... I should have told you a long time ago. But I just couldn't. What? - Wait! I can't go on like this. I just see how shitty you feel and it's wrong. Anyway ... Julia. I... - Google, I know. You know? - Of course I do. In this case, the friendzone is much safer. Well then, I'll should probably go. - Come on, I'll drive you. Thank you. Hi Papa. - Hi. Good day, Valentin Jurjewitsch. - Hello. Are you in the army? - Me? Well, theoretically. If needed. As an option. No. You don't need to. Understood. Thanks. Do you have to go to the train station? Are you going to your grandma? No, to work. You work now? Where? At Rostelecom. Maybe you're just trolling? In what sense? Well, in the sense, Google works for Rostelecom. Right, here. To the right? ROSTELECOM This okay? - Yes, thank you. Bye. - Bye. Bye! See you tomorrow, Comrade General. Thanks for the lift. Young man. Pass. Here... - Fine, go through. If you want to run away, I've thought it all through. First we put the guards out of action, then plastic surgery, then we shave your hair off ... - Stop! and then we ship you to Mongolia disguised as a nun, then on small horses to Tibet, and from there, covering our tracks, directly to Kamchatka. You will have to do without any contacts for a while. But the nature there is really breathtaking. Thanks for the great offer, dad. Really interesting. But perhaps we torment ourselves a little more. I don't want you to be suspended. Movement test completed. Good day. - Good day. Go through the first section. Maximum acceleration in the second section. Okay, go ahead. What do you make of it? Impressive? Did you find out what it is made of? Actually, from water. The exoskeleton absorbs carbon dioxide and gains regenerative power. Some kind of biotechnology. A kind of photosynthesis. Good day. - Good day. Good day. Does he bounce around for a long time? Ten more minutes, Comrade General. Does he hear us? Our engineers have installed a radio headset under the helmet. A Russian galactic product. Hello Julia. Let's get started? I'm ready. What did you think of when you found out that a spaceship crashed into the city? Nothing. I fainted. I was rescued. Good. And then when you found out that your girlfriend had died? What do you feel when someone close to you dies? Julia, please do not move. The fixation is necessary for the purity of the experiment. And then you decided to take revenge. Do I understand this correctly? I can't remember. And then? Why did you decide to help this creature? I've told you a hundred times! Her negative emotions cause significant amplitude swings. Can you see it! Julia, what about your friend Artyom? What happened between you two? Nothing, we broke up. Please tell me why. Is this related to the appearance of the alien? At what moment did you start to feel sympathy for him, affection toward him? Do I have to answer that? We're all hoping for a big breakthrough. I hate to remind you, but it all depends on your Julia. If we had our hands freed ... What do you want me to allow? Should I treat her like a lab rat? She is our only key to these technologies. Julenka, with your permission, someone will talk to you. OK? Hi. There is a reaction! Clear vibration. That's all! We're done! Speak! I ... I don't know what to say. Get me out of here! Hey! Forgive me. - You killed me! No. I didn't shoot you. I shot him. I hoped I would die there with you too. But ... But nothing happened. I had an ... acute cerebral circulatory disorder. A stroke. You yourself originally proposed to kill him. Continue! Nothing would have happened if not ... Father! Valentin Jurjewitsch! Please do not jump to conclusions! Valentin Jurjewitsch! - Where is she? Valentin Jurjewitsch! Get reinforcements! Quiet, be calm! Hello, Valentin Jurjewitsch. - What are you doing here? I ... Serving my country. Get him out! - Why am I in prison? Your daughter is fine. You're fine too. Why me? What do I have to pay for? Well, what happened there, Julia? No more examinations. I can enforce that. Do you believe me? You can do everything. I'll be in the car. - No. Can I, for once, do without these escorts and guards? Just leave me alone for a while! I beg you dad! Please! Once. Where's Karabanov? We summoned him, Comrade General. Hello, Comrade General. - Vanya! You can't go to your family today. - They don't know me anymore anyway. Yeah. Exactly. Put on something else. Like what? Something like that. Okay?! Had a shitty day? All of life is crappy. This was ordered for you. She's had enough, thanks. My little brother. He doesn't let me go anywhere alone. I am Julia. - I know. Ivan. I know. You can't stand me. Follow me at every turn. Protect my dull life. The job is annoying, isn't it? You don't understand at all, why I should be so important to someone. My last job was to protect the chief of a small, proud tribe. He was attacked every week. Gunshots, mines ... Our convoy was blown up. And when it was quiet, he bought 12 year old girls from the neighboring tribe and "took them to wife". There was only one reason why I should protect him: He was the middleman in negotiations with even worse contemporaries who could help with the exchange of prisoners. So, No. This job doesn't annoy me at all. I very much doubt that you are less worth protecting than that bearded pedophile. Damn it. That's not fair. I thought my story was the saddest one out there. Julia. I owe a lot to your father. I promised to bring you back home safely before midnight. Let's go. So, to dad? We must go. Vanya. I think I've had enough. I am Khariton. We must go. - Buddy, the girl is busy. But she doesn't want to stay here with you. - She comes with me. Find another one. You think you can act against her will because you are authorized to use violence and carry a weapon. But that's not the case. Please don't resist otherwise I have to hurt you. Julia, let's go. Hey, be careful? Call the security service! Anyone! Stop it! Roger that? Technology! Get your phone and dial a number. Hurry up! Which? - Any one! Sol! Actvate! Sol! Actvate! Route calculated. Come on! - Didn't you mix something up?! Be careful! Sol, we're ready. Good. Unnecessary occupants can leave the car. What Unnecessary? Get out of here! Buckle up. This increases your chances of survival. Stop! Are you completely crazy?! Get lost! Stop! Stop the car! I'm not doing anything! Can't you see that?! Serjoscha, back! Valentin Yurievich, she is in the car with some man around 30 years old. Dark hair. He introduced himself as Khariton. - Do not shoot. Report every 3 minutes. Prepare for evacuation. Move everything to the Ministry of Defense. What do you mean "everything"? We have equipment, facilities... Check with the anti-missile forces. With all due respect, can I have an explanation? They're back. What's going on with my car? Sol now controls the network and the satellites. He helps us. Julia, you are in danger. You have gone too far with your research. We must fly now. What are you talking about? Fly where? There are a lot of habitable planets in space. Unnecessary passengers can still get out if they wish. Sol! - Route is corrected. I see them! I am pursuing! No passengers were injured during the trip. New route calculated. Valentin Yuryevich. I lost them. Once again. Were you driving? Technically, yes. But I had no control over the car. Wait. It... All by itself, do you understand? Look here! Again! Chara! Chara! I can see that you are hurting. I buried you! I thought you were dead. But you... You even have ... Why didn't you come back sooner? The last time, everything ended badly. A little doorway. And have you been living here for a long time? 123 days. I'm going crazy! Wait, how did you ... You don’t have ... Did Sol print you money? No. I have a job, a house and a vegetable garden. A vegetable garden! You survived here all by yourself? Man adapts to everything. I tried to ... ...tell you. Maybe tomorrow then, yes? Google helped. - Aha. Don't suck up to me! I don't like traitors. Chara, go away. NO, that applies to all of you here. You are offended because you think you have suffered more than I have? No. I dont know. - For me it was a week in space, but according to your calendar, the restoration took two years. Sol stayed in your system because I couldn't have endured the transition. And then what?? You had to fly away? I would have. I have violated the protocol. Yes? Dad, hello. It's me. Where are you? I am with him. Turn on the camera. I will. I just wanted to see you If mom was still alive I would call her and tell her that I love her. I love you too. No less than her. Really. Well, I don't tell you that often. I have to fly away. Far away? Far away. Dad, don't say anything. You know, I have nothing left to do here. Everything will be fine. Really. I promise you. Do you believe me? Naturally. Track the signal. Form a task force. Carefully! Without violence. At your command. You can smoke here. Firstly, we don’t smoke at the table. And secondly, I quit after my boyfriend was killed. You don't have to give up smoking. This thing makes you well again. Maybe I don’t want to poison the Earth. I'm attached to this planet. Delicious! What if we don't go anywhere? We can settle somewhere close by. In Kamchatka. I don't even have a passport. How are we supposed to get across the border? You will pass. But we need to stir up the corruption scheme. Oh dear God! You have developed a sense of humor ?! Well then, tell your ... galactic government, I agree with everything. But if you ... trade me for some martian ... Promise it! A promise is a deception based on the claim that what you want is 100% likely to happen in the future. But due to the lack of competitive life forms on Mars, I can ... How can I make this animal understand that this is my sleeping place? If all your technologies can't even help you, then it's hopeless. I'm not going anywhere without Chara! This is not up for discussion! Attention to all employees of the laboratory! Organized evacuation of the equipment is taking place. Lift carefully! Careful! Lift exactly horizontally! Where's the task force? - On the way. Valentin Jurjewitsch, they're tearing off the manipulator arm ... Where to with the prisoner? Into the car with him! - Come on! Put him in the armored car. - Where are you taking me? We'll soon see. When we get the command. Hey, give me a cigarette. Or do you need an order for that too? He'll betray you. They have the whole family there. What are you waiting for? Take him to the car. Yes Sir! Come on! Target under control. The task force is in contact, Comrade General. I'm listening. A man and a girl. They are not armed. I do not see the need to use weapons. Yes, put them down, Major! Do you hear me? I repeat, they are not armed. They are not a threat. - I said, put your guns down! Guns down! Shoot to kill! Center, Repeat the command. Are you deaf or something? I said don't shoot! Do not use force if possible! Attention, this is Center 2. Give the all-clear, all-clear. Neutralize. At your command! - Move side! Open the gate! We're leaving! We're going in! He's resisting! We need to get to the river. They're escaping! Open fire! Chara! Alpha answer, Center 2. Intruder located in airspace. Destroy target! Roger that. Destroy target 1. Attention! Goal 1! Fire! There was a launch from the Air Defense. Object destroyed. - Target hit. It has disappeared from the radar. Connect me to the tactical group. Reserve line, anything! Where to with him? - No idea! Just take him away with the scooter, I don't care! I have enough problems of my own. Hands! Give me a cigarette. That's not allowed. - Brother. One for the road. Stop! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Sol! Sol has been deactivated. You can come back. She must be destroyed. What's going on? We're too late. Switch to manual control. Then you will be destroyed with her. The Air and Space Forces have been activated. Prepare to attack! Whose order is this? Who's in charge? Commencing attack. - Roger that. Petja, let me have a go. - Yeah, wait. Please! Petja! Hi. I've spotted an object. It's moving along the channel of the Moscow River heading to the city center. He's probably alone in there. Destroy the object! 965, let's get him! Target acquired. Request permission to fire. You did it. There are a lot of civilians here. Confirm the command. Destroy the object! Roger that. They are all burnt. Everyone back! Move aside! Nobody leaves! Guns away! Stay back! I'll get a doctor. - Wait, she needs water. Lots of water. Hey! What's this about? What are you up to? Are you high or something? Hey! Stop! Hey! Where are you going? Stop! Stop! Where are you going? Call the Air Defense and the Home Office. Where? Understood, I'm coming. What about this? - Take it to the Ministry of Defense. Personally. - Yes Sir. What do they want from her? This is not the military. Everything is being controlled by Ra. Ra? - This is a spaceship. Its protocol allows the development of other civilizations to be corrected. You call it war. How does he do that? You yourselves share information about yourself. Appearance, personal data, voice samples. Practically nothing is safe. Ra has access to everything. And he can manipulate any data flow. The military simply doesn't know whose orders it carries out. Any more questions? Yes. What does he want? He wants to do what you failed to. Kill Julia. As I understand it, there are no human casualties so far. Only injured? - For now, yes. Comrades officers! The President and the Minister of Defence have been informed. They have left the summit and are on their way. The flight takes about 12 hours. Please, take a seat. Who gave the order? - You forget yourself, Comrade General. My daughter is there! Who gave the order to fire? What is going on with these communications? Calm down, Valya, sit! Sit down, Valentin Yurievich. Where's the representative of Air and Space Forces? From whom did the pilots received the command? From me. - Who authorized you to launch missiles in central Moscow? You did, Comrade General. I ordered to shoot my own daughter? We can get the records. The command went through the internal line. Do that. Quickly. Krylow, two K-52 helicopters to the Moskvoretskaya bank! Right away. The target is under water. Destroy the target at the first opportunity. In the middle of Moscow, Comrade General? - Roger that. Do I have to repeat myself? - No sir. Understood. Turn on the news. Quickly. Put the news on the big screen. I remind you that they are looking for Julia Lebedewa suspicion of a terrorist attack. According to preliminary information, she is responsible for the explosion of a building in Moscow. At present, the number of victims is still not known although 24 deaths are reported so far. We have a recording that could be considered as Lebedewa's manifesto. It was apparently made immediately after or just before the explosion. Can you hear me? Then let's get started. A UFO crashed in Tschertanowo three years ago. You said it was an alien attack. These are lies. We attacked them. And then you made me a lab rat. My father personally led the experiments. I request the release of all information about this spacecraft that the Department of Defense is keeping secret. The military has stolen extraterrestrial technologies and is secretly working to develop a new weapon. I know, you think that no one can stop you. But that's not the case. And what now? She needs pure water. Go and get some. Water? Go into the store, take the bottles and give the money to the woman at the till. Listen, I know how to go to the store. You've been out of society for 3 years. You may have lost skills. You go to the store. - No. You go to the store. Anyone, please? Or I'll just go myself? You're the only one not listed in the databases. Do you have money? - I have a job. GO! I was waiting for you to understand for yourself just how dangerous it is. I didn't wait. But now I'm ready for anything to ... You understand nothing but war. Fine. So we go to war. There will be more explosions. It is no longer only your earth. The question remains: Why didn't we find out earlier that this girl was not only in contact with an alien, but also received an object from him, the purpose of which is still unknown. Where's the signal coming from? - You're live on the air. We're not transmitting. Cut the sound! What's happening? Who's on the air? However there is no real progress. Uh oh. The signal is not coming from the television tower. The same information is all over the Internet. Well, then what is it? - Maybe it's a hacker attack? Unfortunately, no. At least not from this planet. Not from this planet? Do you mean to say ... If the attacker is within range, we will find him. And according to the defense protocol, we fight back. To activate the protocol, I'll need evidence. Strong, comprehensible, serious evidence. If necessary, we will get them. But for now... we have to disarm them. No mobile communications. No digital technology whatsoever. The old communications technology needs to be restored. All communication via landline only and courier service. Agreed. Proceed! CAUTION! SEALED - DO NOT OPEN! Special Edition! ATTENTION! DON'T TRUST DIGITAL MEDIA There you can see where you're going with all your hi-tech. Hey, young man. Unclean. Thirsty? - Exactly. Yes Mama? Who, Misha? Say that again. Hi? - What Julia? Good day. Are you collecting stickers? - No. Loyalty card with us? - No card. Would you like to apply for one? - No, I don't. In a rush. You can register them with the app. I know that. I don't want a loyalty card. I don't collect stickers. I just want pure water. You can order from our website ... That's enough. Kota, calm down. Can you explain that to me normally? Which Julia? What House? A terrorist attack? Are you all right? The incident is very interesting. Julia Lebedewa is wanted under suspicion of extremism. Schora, did your people put that on the screen? My parents say decide for yourself. Essentialy, it's a certainty for me. I hope cybersport works. - This is an excellent option. Especially when compared to studying physics or mathematics. Cybersport is very topical. But your most important task now is to find Julia Lebedewa, who is accused of multiple crimes. Yes. Yes. Normal. Mom, are you calling me? - Wait, I'm talking to your father. Which Julia? What's that got to do with me? Julia Lebedewa is still being searched for. For any information on her whereabouts ... To all patrol officers. We are looking for Julia Lebedewa. Most recently she was ... Where are you off to with all that? - Water is the basis of life. ID is the basis of life. Your documents? - None included. Aren't you from here? - I live in Kuschelewo. What is your full address? - My full address is Virgo Super Cluster, Local Group, Milky Way, Arm of Orion, Solar system, Planet Earth, Eurasian continent, Russia, Moscow region, Dorf Kuschelewo, Mittelstrasse 14. I have a job, a house and a vegetable garden. Go ahead, Arm of Orion. Yes Yes Yes. And what did she do? Blown up a house. - O my God! The whole city is in turmoil. Do you hear it, Lena? I'll call you back. See you. To all posts. Looking for a gray Volvo ... Good day. Who do I contact about this Lebedewa? Faster! Driver of the gray Volvo, stop immediatly! "DARLING" I can not talk right now, I'll call you back. Roma is in the hospital, Vanya! - What? The house exploded. I only went out briefly ... I don't understand. - What don't you understand? Lena, calm down! Where are you now? Your son almost died. I don't understand why you're panicking. What don't you understand? We have to get them! Mom, are you talking to dad? Roma, do your homework, or I'll call the police! Lena, listen to me carefully. If you see them, call me immediately. I'm listening to you, but I don't understand what we have to do with it. I thought you were coming home earlier to do something with Roma. He has a concussion. We're in the hospital, I'll give him to you. Hi Papa. - Roma. Are you watching the news? This is Julia Lebedewa. It is now all over the Internet. Roma what ... - She blew it up. How? How are you? - I have to go. The doctor is here. I'll send you a link. ... destroyed a house in which ... The number of victims is still unclear. It is constantly updated and for the time being it is increasing. The Ministry of Civil Protection has set up a hotline where you can find out whether family members are among the victims, God forbid! MOSCOW - CONSTRUCTION ON LEBEDEWSTRASSE MOSCOW IS LOOKING FOR JULIA LEBEDEWA DO YOU KNOW WHO JULIA LEBEDEWA IS? District Commissioner Senior Lieutenant Filippov. Good day. - Good day. A fellow student? - Yes. Where, when and under what circumstances did you see her last? In the institute.. - Who's there? There you are at last! I've been waiting two years. When will you finally take care of the discotheque on the ground floor? We'll sort out the disco. - Then do so. Should you find out anything ... - we will, we will... Grandma, what are you doing? Go get some rest. How come? I feel like I am running a hotel. Where did you hide your friends? Good day. I am Khariton. And, is it helping? Yes, she'll live. But she is no longer one of you. The pain changes her. It makes her stronger. The power that grows in her can be a threat to everyone. So does Ra want to kill her? Ra is an artificial intelligence. He doesn't want anything. He only calculates probabilities and acts according to a defense protocol. A protocol? Basic mathematics. One death is better than many. All military units are involved in the search for Julia Lebedewa. Law enforcement agencies ... So what did she do? Nothing like that. She was falsely accused. - Ah, of course, political. Yes, you could say that. - And you? He is not from here. - I have a job, a house and ... He's just trying to get her out of the country. And I'm helping, a little. He's been thinking that for eight years. We'll both go to prison. And that one too? No, that one ... I am the only one here who has suffered innocently. And since then, nothing but stress. Do you have a drink or something? I'll take a look. And what about her? Will she squeal? Well. To us! You're welcome. But your people ... Why aren't you just killing us with some fucking death ray? You've got one, yeah? - Even we don't have that anymore. There are more effective methods. And we also have rockets. And we can fight back! - And we can definitely do that. This is a bad solution. It can lead to escalation. So, elimination is a bad idea. But hiding all your life ... is a good one? I will not do anything that could harm her. Neither will I. To love! To love! To love. How is it? Everything okay? So do you think we have to hide in the forest for the rest of our lives? - We have no other choice. This stuff dampens the reflexes and slows down processes in the organism. That's the whole point. Come on! To the intergalactic union. - Firstly, I come from this galaxy. Secondly, there is no connection between alcohol consumption and the likelihood that words previously spoken come true. Don't be a smart ass! It's easy ... Tradition. Come on, drink! This isn't vodka! - It's better. Let's take him. Where? - We hand him over. You have no choice. Otherwise you go to jail as an accomplice. Either him ... or us. Which planet are you fighting for? He's heavy. - Try harder. If we turn up without a live alien, no one will believe us. Put your hat on! ATTENTION! DON'T TRUST DIGITAL MEDIA! Hey! You free boss? I am now. Thank you. Goodbye! - See you again. Good day. What are you guys up to? We're saying goodbye to our army friend. A gun and a shovel are friends of a soldier. Where are we heading to? - Ministry of Defense. And which department? Space. You don't have to shoot. It's not necessary. - Quiet! Whether you like it or not, they compel you. It's not so bad. You learn about life. You get to sniff gunpowder. I am Sergei Briljow with an extra edition of the "Vesti" program. If you can say that. Because at the moment we are broadcasting through the mobile stations of the Civil Defense and Emergencies. We are faced with some completely incomprehensible provocation. Little is known so far, but the fact is we are being attacked by an enemy who is able to capture all the digital broadcasting channels in an instant. Be careful. Trust only the information directly from the police, the military, rescue workers and city services. If possible, tell your friends and family that they should not use any means of communication. And most importantly, don't fall for provocations. Where is she? - In a safe place. I'll shoot you on the spot, understand? Without a trial and investigation! - She is at my house! Google you idiot. Now what about the internet and the television signal? Was that your people? - Ra needs Julia. He has decided to destroy them in order to have peace. They're saveing the world ... Facists ... And I've decided to destroy your Ra! Where is he? Where? Near Earth? You cannot fight him. You don't know what he's capable of. We didn't start. We comply with the defense protocol. Ra thinks the same. Get these two out of here. Khariton. Help me. Only you know the exact coordinates of its position. So decide now ... who means more to you. Your world? Or my daughter? Leave a message after the signal ... Check with the Barnaul Observatory. We need confirmation of the coordinates given to us. Special attention to the Jamal-410 satellite. He must be there somewhere. - Yes Sir! Vanya, follow me. Would you allow me to leave for half an hour, Valentin Jurjewitsch? Is that a mobile phone? I forbade that. Go get Julia and bring her to me personally. Not a word to anyone. Here is the address. Is that clear? Yes, Clear! 23 Hours, 50 Minutes, 38 seconds. - Look. An unidentified object is recorded in sector 5032. The object maneuvered and then stopped moving ... Movement set at coordinates ... - 23 hours, 38 minutes ... 322, how is the reception? Over. The Security Council is on the line, Comrade General. Comrades officers! Yes, Valentin? Well, what is there? We have confirmation, It is an external intervention. We have the coordinates. We can execute protocol. What do you say to that, comrades? If it actually controls the entire information network, including the NATO missile systems, and we want to shut it down, then it will probably try to intercept our missiles. We want to briefly switch off the satellites that are controlled by the object. In what way? All our satellites are combined into a chain. If only one fails, control is lost for a period of time. Excuse my banal remark Comrade General. But without the military satellites we lose our defenses. Who's talking about the military? Follow me. Good day. They're with me. We have reset the whole system. Yet they come in anyway! - Hello! Hello! Hello! This is a hold-up! Everyone stay in their place! I have 2 lots of news: good and bad. The bad: You were hacked by an interplanetary spaceship. You don't have to be ashamed of that, it can happen to anybody. The good: we will now pay them back, harshly. You just have to ... turn off your satellite. Why in such a hurry? Where are you going? They will be back soon! Did they take him to the military? Ministry of Defense? Oh my God. Open the door, please. - I'm not supposed to let you out. I said, Open, The door, Please! Let's go. Sorry. That was the only solution. You think you are protecting them. In truth, you're destroying everything that reminds you of your mistake. Up there on your Sirius, you must have studied psychotherapy. Set to speaker phone. - Yes sir! Judging by the speed with which the spaceship forms the signal we only have a few seconds before Ra restores the chain. So we only switch off the satellite when the rocket is already in the air. Understand. And what can we do in these few seconds? Speaker off. Shoot down the spaceship. How? Echelon-2. Comrade General, we both know that we don't have the Echelon-2. And we both know that we do. And you ... are all ... so perfect there. Civilized. And we here ... are just savages. And we can just ... be killed. Just as long as everything runs according to protocol, right? It's because of people like you that there is a protocol at all. The reasons are clear. But I'm against it. There's too much risk, Valentin Jurjewitsch. You know me. Shooting is the last thing I would suggest. But now we are left with little choice. I didn't think I would saying this, but I'm glad to see you Really. Everything OK? My wife and son were home. She was safe with me. And... if you hadn't flown in nothing would have threatened her. You... Are you talking about the explosion? You know I didn't do anything. The boy is seven years old. He’s in the hospital, I don’t know which one, because there’s no communication. But if it turns out that his condition worsens, I will come for you. Personally. And your dad won't be able to help you. Sooner or later... she will perish. Because of you. Congratulations. You're now human, Khariton. Welcome to Earth. Do you think I didn't ask myself how can I make up for everything? Every single day. Every day. Every ... Day. Every day. Give the order to Rostelecom. Hammer, let's go. Let's go, Hammer! Proceed. Come on! It worked. Lebedev? For you, Comrade General. - I hear! Well done, Valya. Thank you. They did everything right. It's still too early. I'm sorry, I can't speak now. Get me a full report of all available satellites. The observatories and the ISS should confirm visual proof. Both of you. Out! A huge crowd of people gathered at the building of the National Center for Defense. The are demanding the release Julia Lebedewa, who is suspected of having blown up a residential building. Many of the gathered believe that the general is covering for his daughter and must also be held accountable for trying to keep her from prosecution. Keep calm! I do not know what happened to your family but I didn't do it, you hear? There she is! Van'! It's not my fault. It's all fake. Everything. That's her! Get down! Get Back! It's all a lie! Thank you for believing me. I don't believe you. Did you destroy him? We, destroyed it. Thank you, Vanya! I didn't think it would end this way. At least not with you. It wasn't her. You should know that. - I owe you nothing more. I have honor! I'm fine. We weren't allowed to use the phones. How are you? Your uncle is in the hospital. Did you hear about the terrorist attack? All because of this Lebedewa. My god, she must be really crazy. I can hear you. I know you weren't destroyed. I tried to minimize the damage. Under these new circumstances, I am forced to act more aggressively. This is not an exact translation. But you don't have to stay there. You can go back. I'm not going anywhere. Your prediction is incorrect. Yes, people make mistakes because they don't act from the mind alone. They listen to something within themselves that can make them better. You will be disappointed. People only listen to what they are told. I warned you. I asked you to stop but you didin't listen. You forced me to act. I understand that the death of some distant species is of no particular concern to you, right? Then start worrying about yourself. Lenochka, pick up the phone.. We didn't want this. But many will die today. You tried to turn me into a weapon. I will be one. DARLING Hello? Where are you? I couldn't reached you. - Roma died. He died, Vanya. It looks like a dome of water. Chemists say it is H20 in composition. About 3 kilometers in diameter. The Ministry of Defense is also inside. There is no communication with them. Who is in command there? - General Lebedev. What about the water level? It's bad, Mr. President. JULIA LEBEDEWA IS WANTED Dad, where have you been! - Let's move, quickly!! Away from here! Dad! Oh dear! Dad! Smart Home - Water leak sensor triggered. Smart Home - Water leak sensor triggered. The dome is about 200 meters high. The object itself is hidden in the upper layer of water. It is still unclear how it can be destroyed. We can try flying directly through the dome, but there is little hope. Take action! - Got it. Sorry, but you need to see this. ...Military. So far we have no contact with the people inside ... My mother is in there! I have to go to her! Can I get through? Excuse me! Excuse me! 358, missiles ready for use. Attack the target. 358, Fire one! 358, Fired two! Target was not destroyed. All missiles fired. Repeat, Target was not destroyed. More than 300 cubic meters of water flow through per second. The influx is coming from above. The dynamics are still unclear. In twenty minutes everything will be under water. There is a helicopter on the roof. Take Julia with you and get out of here. And you? I'll catch up with you. - Father... Dad! Dad! Are the civil defense lines still active? Leave your houses immediately. If possible, equip yourself with floatable objects. Don't try to stay home. We haven't been able to break through the dome yet. But that doesn't mean we don't stand a chance. If the intensity of the water flow does not decrease, the upper and lower layers will merge at a height of around thirty meters. We are cut off from the outside. - Uncle Kolja, move aside! If you can hear me, please contact the Department of Civil Protection, nearest military personnel or police officers for instructions on your evacuation. If this is not possible, get to the roofs of the tallest buildings. Get up to the roof! Hurry! We are doing everything possible. But without your help, we will not be able to save everyone. Please help others in your area. I don't think I have to explain that to you. Hurry! Come on! Khariton! Khariton! Don't panic, please. Don't leave anyone behind. Every life counts. We are people. And we have to try to save each other until the very end. I know how we can destroy him. - The helicopter is waiting on the roof! Where's my capsule? We need to get it into the upstream. The capsule will then get caught in the current, and with a bit of luck, it will be thrown directly into the ship. The strong impact should cause its complete destruction. This means a trip with a one way ticket. Yes. Then show me how to get this thing started. If it works, then tell Julia that I love her. I didn't tell her that often. - You tell her yourself. Only I can control the capsule. Ra won't notice her if it is controlled manually. I need your help with navigation. Can you keep me on course? Comrade officers, the command was: Everyone leaves this room! Immediate evacuation! - And you, Valentin Jurjewitsch? What didn't you understand Comrade Colonel? Get out and close the door behind you! As firmly as possible. Can you hear me, Khariton? About ten degrees to the right. Roger that. Keep right below the dome. 123, the water is about 5 meters high on Sadowo-Karetnaja Street. I can't assess beyond that. The water continues to flow. 127, about 8 people are on the roof of the circus building. They have to get out of there. They will be flooded in 10 minutes. The same situation on Petrovka Street. Can you go rescue them? 129, understood. Heading to Petrovka. I'm heading to the roof. Waiting for orders. 129 here. Does anyone see a clearing? 123, not yet. 129, I have about 15 minutes of fuel left. I tried to recover people from the hotel but it's too dangerous. Is there an alternative? Civil protection are getting people out by boat. 127, I have some spare room. I'll need to find a landing site in the next 2 minutes. Stay up as long as you can. 123, we're trying. What else do we have left? Where else can we go? Come on, men, God help us! 127, request permission to land on Sandunowski Alley. My wife is there. - 127, permission granted. 123, I've passed the garden ring. There is no place to land. Fuel is running out. There is a suitable place behind the skyscraper. We'll try there. We are going down. 326, the water boundary is approaching your flight altitude. Careful! There are lines! Damn it! We're falling! Hold tight! I can no longer control it! Julia! Jump! Julia! Get onto the roof! The city is in a state of emergency. Everything is under water. We are heading back! Over! I'm being drawn in, Artyom! I can't! Come on, grab her hand! Pull them up! You ok? Let's go! Waiting for further commands! Come on, come on. Further right. About a kilometer to the wall. I hope you can make it. It's a slim chance but I'm trying. Have you evacuated? Of course. You're probably lying And given the high probability of your death, I must follow the tradition and ask: Would you mind if I lived with Julia? This is a bad time, Khariton. If you are concerned about the future, I have ... I know you have a job, a house, and a vegetable garden. Given the high probability of your death, I allow it. Careful, take a left, otherwise you will head into the tower. Basja! Julia! Get under cover! - It's me ... It's me he's after. - Julia, don't even think about it! Julia, calm down! - Step aside! You decided that I needed that, right? Survive at all costs? Do you think that’s all that I want? Who gave you all the right to decide for me? Who gave you the right to decide? Who gave you this right? - No, don't do this! It's me! Julia, don't even think about it! This all happened because of me! - No, don't! That's her! - You have to kill me. If they kill me then it all ends. What are you waiting for? There are people drowning here! Kill me, then the nightmare is over and that thing flies away. Kill her! That will not do! Kill me and it's all over! Come on! How much further? Say again? How much longer, until ... How long until it ... Comrade Khariton. Go on without me. 127, I see a new object in the dome perimeter. It is moving fast. What's this? One of ours? Yes. I blew up the building! It's all my fault! Kill her! - What are you waiting for? Kill me! - Julia Lebedewa. Kill her! Vanya! Kill her! That's her! - Vanya! Vanya, I'm here! Julia Lebedewa. - Vanya! Step aside! Listen! I understand what you're feeling now. I've been through that too. Vanya, you know it's my fault, right? That's right. Move aside Move aside. No! I have nowhere else to go! Artyom, please move to the side! Go ahead. No! Shoot! SHOOT! Do it! 237, I'm seeing turbulence from the depths. I can't make out the source but it's getting stronger. All helicopters withdraw at a distance of 1km from the dome! Attention everyone! We're moving a few km's distance from the dome! An unexpected water discharge is possible. Don't get any closer 226, we're retreating. I confirm the information. The upper part of the object can be seen now. It is moving up quickly. 237, see the target below me. Upper part visible. I have it in my sights. It's moving upward! 226, I can confirm that. I see it. I can attack. Fire on the target! 237, we're shooting at the target as a group. We're firing now. 237, missiles fired. Bank left. 226, fired. Turning away. There was a hit. The target was not destroyed. Roger that. Return back. What's in there? Is the water merging? 226, I can't tell. It is bright and pulsating. The water itself is bringing the object to the surface. 160, turn and fire on the object. It's a hit! We confirm. It's a hit! 226, the water is receding. Permission to return? The water is returning? - 237, the water level is dropping rapidly. The boundaries of the dome are the same. Is the water evaporating? I see people. Julia. Let's go. Goodbye, Valentin Jurjewitsch. LEBEDEWA JULIA VALENTINOWNA 21.08.1998 - 07.09.2019 ARTJOM ROMANOWITSCH TKATSCHEW April 6, 1994 - September 7, 2019 First in this direction, then down the volcano crater, all right? Let's go! Route is being corrected. It is 500 meters to the destination. Chara! Where do you want to go now? We go where nobody can find us.
