"Hampton... knows..." the truth, even if... he pretends otherwise. He needs... to disclose... "what happened." Okay. Gotta hide this. Ah, I still wish you were staying closer to home. It's not like I've never been gone before. For a summer, maybe. This is... you know. This is different. You're just upset that I'm not going to USC, like you and Dad. That's not true. I think this is gonna be a wonderful and unique opportunity for you. What are you looking at? It's just something that Professor Hampton wrote. "The actions of time leave its mark" not only on our collective soil, but on the very seeds that drive our individual perception. To become aware of the weeds within "is, in essence, the act of blossoming anew." Sounds a little too flowery for my liking. He's just saying that we all have scars and that taking chances is healthy. Okay. Just remember, even though you like his writing, it doesn't mean you have to love everything that he says. Oh, my god. Mom, I'm not that stupid. Just stop worrying. Plus, Jodie's gonna be there. She'll keep me in check. Great. Just what I was hoping. Mom. What? I know how your mind works. You already want to know who these kids are, who their parents are. Comes with the territory. Okay, well, can you just put your investigative journalist brain away? We don't judge books by their covers, right? Just like your father would say. Hannah! Hey! Hi, Mrs. Marks! Hi, Jodie. How are you settling in? It's amazing here. My parents send their love. Oh, I'm sorry we missed them. I'll connect with your mom. I can't believe we're both here! I know! I'm so excited. How's the room? Oh, girl. Just wait. I worked us some magic. The magic of Jodie Mays. - I'll take this. - Thank you. Let's go! Follow me! - I can't wait to show you guys. - It's so nice. So this is our building? Yeah. It's so nice. I can't wait to show you the amenities. Wow. Easy, Mom. Are you kidding me? Okay, they did not have dormitories like this when I went to school. They had rooms in the olden days? Very funny. No, seriously, how did we get this dorm room? I managed to talk to the student union. I told them we were childhood friends and that we wanted to room together. And I got my parents to put in a good word. You are tenacious. Early bird catches the worm. Can you please rub some of that tenacity on my daughter? Oh. Ha, ha. No, this is gonna be great, you know, us being apart. I can figure out myself and... define me for me. That's very self-aware of you, Mrs. Marks. Ah. See? I can be woke. And, that said, I am your mother, mothers know things, so, if you need anything, I'm only a phone call away. I appreciate it. Oh, and I also thought that I would register as a volunteer for the college... Could you just... Could you just not? It's-It's nothing personal, I just... She needs to use this space to grow, Nancy. Like you did in your day. Liberating your mind, expanding the invisible societal and psychological walls that imprison us. You're gonna be one of those overbearing psychologists, aren't you? I'll give you a discount. All right. I should get going. Please say hi to your parents for me. I will. And you... It's a new chapter. Be strong. Love you, Mom. I love you, too. Drive safe. Thank you. Bye, girls. Bye. Her first time being home alone? Since before she met my dad, yeah. You'll be fine. Anyway, let's get you set up. Orientation starts in an hour. Okay, so I was thinking about signing up for the debate team, but I haven't quite... Those look delicious. Oh... Look at this place. This is so... - Jodie! - Hey, Daisy! Welcome, you two. You must be Hannah. I know all about you. Oh. Hi. I'm Daisy. I'm the Spencer Dorm R.A. and Residency Chairperson for the freshman students. Your mother is Nancy Marks, the journalist, right? Yep, that's her. I love her writing. You must be so proud. She's a great writer. As I bet you are. No pressure, of course. I'm not really into what she's into, though. Oh, no? What are you focusing on? Here, follow me. I'm actually a big fan of Andrew Hampton's work... Or Professor Hampton. Well, you've come to the right place. We're actually in the same class with him this semester. Oh, no way. That's awesome. Well, welcome. Grab a goody-bag. Sign up for any of the clubs that interest you, and if there's anything else you need, from better pillows, access to the best study spots, info on who's the best kisser... Just let me know. Thanks, Daisy. It was nice to meet you. You too. I'll come say hi later. She's been so cool, and she's head of the student union, so I wanna learn from her. Oh... the handsome devil himself. He's even better in person. Focus on your student union. Good afternoon. As most of you know, I am Sonia Michaels, Dean of the school, and I'd like to welcome you to our fall semester. Our campus, while still relatively new, is built upon the reputation you give it... Guided by the world-class faculty we have for you in residence. I'd also like to take a moment to remind everyone that the health of our student body comes first. If anyone is feeling the need to talk... About anything... Please reach out and do so. Daisy Faulkner, our residency chair, is there to help. Our counselors are here to listen, as we all are. Now... onto brighter things. We have a mixer tomorrow night, and we hope to see you all there... What was the Dean referring to? Surprised your mom didn't scoop it. There was a suicide on campus last semester. My god, that's awful. What happened? Supposedly, this girl felt her grades didn't measure up, and when she got caught plagiarizing, she couldn't take it. Can't believe grades can do that to someone. A lot of childhood trauma leads people to believe they have to maintain some sort of unattainable standard. It's a lot more common than you think. Yeah, I guess. There's gonna be a celebration of life next week. Who's that? Rachel Garber. I heard she's a bit different. What? I'm practicing. Wanna join? I'm here to study journalism and literature, so. Well, a little chemistry never hurt anybody. You're insatiable. Come on! Yes. All right. Right on cue. Come in. Ladies! Just doing the rounds. You settling in okay? Yeah. We're pretty much settled. That's so great to hear! You're really going to love it. Actually, I was gonna ask if there's anything I can do to help you or anyone else on the Board. Are you looking to join the Student Union Board? I am. Great! Yes, amazing. Well, there's a soccer tryout tomorrow. Lots of board members play. Could be good to get in there. Yeah. Sure. I-I've been known to kick around a few balls. Oh! I love it. Hannah, any interest? Um, I hate bruises and kicks and falling, so, I'm gonna leave that to you guys. Of course. Well, if there's anything else you need, I'm just down on the first floor in 101. And I'll see you in Professor Hampton's class tomorrow. I'll see you there. Bye. Been known to kick a few balls around? Yeah. All right. - Okay. - I feel ridiculous. Goodnight, guys. Sleep well. Goodnight. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. There's actually a sign-up sheet, so just stop by the Student Union Building. Thanks, Daisy. Of course. Hannah. Saved a seat for you. Thanks. You'll be glad you're so close. His cologne is to die for. Good morning to you, too. Morning, class. I trust everyone had a good summer? Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. Ah, I see that we have some new faces. Welcome. It's always nice to see. I'm Andrew. Professor Hampton. Now, as most of you know, but for those that don't, my supposed claim to fame lies somewhere between my early op-eds in the mid-2000s, a few books, Pulitzer Prize, and... this, the oldy typewriter. Now, I've been quoted as saying that the typewriter "added stakes to my thoughts... Weight to my words, and consequences to my choices." You know, one bad stroke, one little mistake, and there's be a price to be paid on the page. So, with that in mind, please, indulge me... Laptops, tablets, any electrical devices, put them away, all the way away, that's it. Yes. Now, returning students... Who would care to elucidate on what my three mighty pillars of journalism are? Miss Faulkner. Good to see you again. Go ahead. Personal. Process. Patience. Excellent. Very good. Personal... make it your own. Process... trust in the ritual of putting pen to paper. And patience... learn to have compassion for your journey. Now, I know that some of you have the Freshman Ice-Breaker tonight, but, for your first assignment, due tomorrow, which we will read out loud, I'd like you, in a page or less, to tell me about the weight of your words and the risks that you will take to be the best writer that you can be. Now, far greater minds than mine have often said, "I will do anything... Anything!... " To achieve my dreams... "just don't make me do 'X.'" I want to hear what your "X" is. And the winner, as chosen by your peers, will be my new T.A. Oh, and I want them hand-written. Commit to the page! You can find some pens, some paper. Collect them on your way out. Class dismissed. That's it? He's unconventional. That's how he gets the best out of us. Hey, you coming tonight? Oh, I don't know, just with the assignment now... Come on, please. You have to. I'll be hosting one of the booths. Okay, I'll come. Yay! Okay, I'll see you and Jodie later. I'll see you later. Professor Hampton? I'm Hannah. Hannah Marks. I saw you yesterday, didn't I? Yes. Yeah. I, um, I saw you, too. Um... yeah, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not expecting any kind of special treatment for... My mom is Nancy Marks. She writes... I know who you are, Hannah. Your submission essay was impressive. And I'm well aware of who your mother is, but don't worry, you'll be treated just the same. Okay. Great. Yeah. Um, have a good day. You too. Hey, look at this. Yeah, I saw it earlier. This was her? So pretty. Depression isn't choosy. Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going. It's the Ice-Breaker. It's Professor Hampton. He's tougher than you would expect. And you think Professor Daleski's psych class is easy? I have to read a whole chapter for tomorrow. Hey! Come on. You're too young to turn into your mom. Oh, my gosh. This is amazing. I'm so excited. Hey, hey! - Hey! - You both look gorgeous. So do you. I love your shoes. Oh, these old things? You doing okay, hon'? Yeah, yeah. Just a lot of people. Trust me, they'll feel like family in no time. Excuse me a moment. It's nice. I know, right? What's he doing here? Faculty always drops by for Ice-Breakers. Like I said, family. Hey, how's your first assignment going? Uh, it's not. Not yet. I've done, like, three versions. I hate them all. That's three more than I've done. I don't know what to write about. If there's anything I learned from being in his first class, it's that personal always resonates. Hmm. Oh, my gosh! Are you seeing this? Yeah. Everybody, calm down! Guys, please. Everyone, listen to Dean Michaels. Everyone, please listen to Daisy and Dean Michaels. Please, everyone... just breathe. Could be a deep-fake. Hard to tell these days. So, where is this window? Spencer Dorm. 407. Just this way. Jodie, that's our room. I know, this is the first I'm hearing of this. From what I understand, it's school policy to not disclose the location as to not cause unnecessary grief. I'm freaking out. We just assumed it was as Amy had written... That it was a suicide. There was a letter, which we turned over to the authorities. I'd like to read that. How are you guys holding up? It's a lot to take in. Cyber-Forensics will look into the source of the video. Do you mind if we speak in private? Certainly, Detective. I can't believe this. Honestly, I don't know if I feel comfortable staying here. I totally get that. I'd be creeped out, too. You can stay with me tonight, if you want, and I'll look into what else is available tomorrow. I... I think we'll be okay. Just see what you can do. Of course. I am so sorry, you guys. Okay, well, try get some sleep and I'll see you both tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh... she has the most uncanny timing. I don't want her to worry, so... Hey, Mom. Yeah, everything's great. All settled in. Yeah, everyone's really nice. Hey... Hey. How's the assignment? Uh... You sleep okay? I was all right. Jodie wasn't. It's not the easiest, sleeping underneath those windows, knowing what happened right there. Well, I wish I had better news, but... No rooms available? But there will be. Student turnovers happen all the time. Can I ask you a question about that? Yeah, of course. Do you really think that she was pushed? Well... I mean, I don't want to gossip, but there's this girl, Rachel Garber... she always had it for Amy. What did she have against her? Simple. She liked Amy, Amy didn't like her back. "I recall the first moment I was moved to tears by words..." "And it's not like I was afraid to fail, but it still stopped me from trying." "It's unfortunate that one of the greatest truths" is now also lost to the land of cliche and cynicism. By serving others, we serve ourselves. It seems so obvious. "That it's not so obvious scares me." "And so I ask myself the same question every day." In the face of certain death, would I make the same choice? Will I give into the side of my over-cautious mother? Or will I rise to the side of my brave father, whose courage got him killed? And even though I was too young to really know him... I'll do anything to be like my father... Just don't ask me to risk my life for my work... "because that's what I'm most afraid of." Thank you... Hannah. It's very moving. And it's good work, overall. Nice first effort. Alysha, much, much stronger. Harry, I recommend that you... I had no idea your family had been through that. So, without voting for yourselves, I'd like you to write down who you felt best represented the assignment, with the "Three Ps" being your metric. Now... once you've done that, if you'd like to pop them in there... and we'll tally the results. That was so good, Hannah. Your dad sounded amazing. Thanks, guys. He was. We have a consensus. So, your new T.A., should she accept her mission, is... Hannah Marks. Well done. Thank you. Professor, I can't thank you enough. I'm so excited. Well, I am so glad that they chose you. Really? Hannah, your words... That... That's the power of language, when used properly. Wow, thank you. Actually, I hold a writer's night every week with some of my T.A.s from other lit classes. We get together, we work, we share ideas, sometimes our own writing... Assuming you're available. Of course. Yeah. Anything you need. Great. How's 8:00 p.m.? T-Tonight? Unless you have other plans? Uh... no, that sounds great. Excellent. So... take that. And there you go. What's this? That's my address and keys. Well, you're gonna have a lot of work, aren't you? I won't always be there. See you tonight. He said that? Yup. But not like a pick-up line or anything. Someone's hot for teacher. I am not. Oh, come on! You love his work, he's handsome... who wouldn't have a little crush on him? I'm his student, he's my professor. I'm just... I'm just excited to be his T.A. He gave you his keys. Because I'm his T.A. Well, you definitely don't wanna tell your mom about this. I know. Just trying to enjoy my own achievements before she warns me about the dangers of... I don't even know what she'll come up with. What is this? What'd you find? "No sophisticated method of plagiarism shall result in the formulation of inherent authorship." Oh, my... Oh, my god. This is Amy Hines'. Is that her journal? I think so. I don't know. I wonder if she writes about her last days. Ugh, that's creepy. I need to get this to the Dean tomorrow. What should I wear? I thought this was a student-teacher meeting. It is, I just want to look the part, professionally speaking. Oh, yeah. For sure. Stop. Hi, Professor Hampton. Hannah. Please, call me Andrew. Just... I hate "Professor," it's so formal. Come in, come in. Make yourself at home. I'm just finishing off a couple things in the kitchen. Wow, this is your home? Yeah, I thought it was about time I laid down some roots, you know, and what with this residency, it made sense. It's gorgeous. Thanks. Uh... where is everyone? Well, I had a few late cancellations, so it is just you and I this evening. Oh, we can cancel... No, no, no, it's fine. You know, I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about. Would you like some wine? I found it in the cellar when I moved in. Actually quite good. Sure, yeah. Is this you? Yeah. Well, it's an attempt. Kind of a sad one, really. No, I like it. The dualistic nature of being human. Ha. Well... cheers. Cheers. So what are the two sides of Professor Andrew Hampton? Wow. What... you wanna start there? Yeah. - Just dive right in? - Mm-hmm. Okay, let's dive right in. Oh, we don't have to. No, no, no. No, I like it. In fact, I'll up the ante. Why don't we make this even more interesting, and you tell me? What, me tell you your different sides? Yeah, why not? You know, use your instincts? Okay. I don't know. I feel kind of on the spot. But you know what, sometimes, that's not a bad place to be. And you don't have to be accurate. I often find that my best writing technique, even when it's just for an exercise, it comes from closing my eyes, sitting in a feeling, well, ignoring, of course, my own judgments and just... letting it flow. "Letting it flow." - Letting it flow. - Okay. But you have to close your eyes. That bit is very important... - Okay. - I must say. Well... one side of you loves adventure and discovering a newness... but, like anything, that gets old, so... you crave to feel grounded, hence the home... until that gets old, too. Have you been talking to my therapist? Seriously, that's pretty... pretty on the money. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Your turn. Okay... Okay. Close your eyes. And remember the three Ps... Keep it personal. Okay. Personal. You know who you are... but... to be fully you, you need acknowledge that you're a product of others, and you find that hard. So you rebel, you rebel against your mother. I mean, you rebel against anything that you perceive to be constraining, and that rebellion is exhausting and, ultimately, feels... empty. How am I doing? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - No, no. - overstep or... - No, no. No. - touch a nerve. That's true. Yeah. I... often, I'm wishing that I could... just be me. Just do my own thing, without my mother swarming me. Although, to be fair, you know, if it wasn't for her, there'd be no Hannah Marks. And, well, wouldn't the world be worse off for that? I'm serious. You know, your words have a very... they're gonna have an impact. They already are, with me. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, should we get started? - Yes. - Let's do that. - Let's do that. - Okay. Okay. This way. Thanks. Ah. This is good. This is gold. It's really good. I like what you've done. Oh, no, no, no, no. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's time. Only if you want to. I've never used a typewriter before. Now's the perfect time. Take her for a spin. I'm going to be over here. Okay. Wow. Hannah, this is raw... honest. It's intimate. Thank you. Yeah, I just... I don't know. I just felt really free tonight and... just inspired. I had a really good time. Good. Yeah. I'm glad you're here. Me too. Uh... we shouldn't. I'm your professor. Yeah. You did that? I'm impressed! I'm ashamed. Trust me, you're not the first one to fool around with a teacher. He's like 15 years older than me. Um, try 20. So how far did you go? We just kissed. Mm, kissed by a Brit. My, my. Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Rachel... right? I don't think we've met yet. I'm Hannah. Freshman from Washington State. Great. I really like your hair. I used to dye my hair all the time. Looks really good. You're Nancy Marks' kid, right? Yeah, yeah, I am. Hmm. So much for the apple falling close to the tree. Excuse me? Professor Hampton. He certainly has a type. What? Of course, is how you frame, or re-frame, the scenario that you're critiquing. A T.A. is held to the same time zone as everyone else, Miss Marks. Sorry. I... had a weird morning. It looks like it. Now. We have several second-year journalism majors who are re-taking their first literature class, so, I would like... Miss Faulkner to stand up and tell us the difference between a journalist and a reporter. Daisy? Well... in the media, all reporters are journalists... but... not all... journalists are reporters? Is that a question? It's a statement. Can you tell us why? Daisy, you got this wrong last semester, hence me affording you the opportunity of redemption. Can anybody else answer? Hannah? A reporter gathers facts, finds evidence, and then reports the news, whereas a journalist reports the news, but doesn't necessarily gather the facts themselves. What do you think, Daisy? I think that sounds correct. Not only correct, but it lines up with what most of you want to do. See, journalism requires imagination, right? The ability to take events and frame or reframe them in an eloquent cause-and-effect manner. I know some of you will be better suited, depending on how your brain works, to journalism, and others better suited to reporting facts. Our job, this semester, is to get both of those sides of the brain working. Goes to the very heart of the dualistic nature of being human. We all have at least two sides. You okay? I don't know what his problem is. He always swipes at me. Maybe he's just challenging you. Yeah, like he challenged Amy? How did he challenge Amy? I don't want to gossip. Everything all right? The police authenticated the video. Oh, no. Do they have any evidence or... They're not saying. But, please... we don't want to alarm anyone. Best keep this quiet for now. Of course. Oh, my god. If someone pushed her out the window, then... They could still be here. Creepy. Listen, I gotta run, but let's talk about this after Jodie's tryouts this afternoon. Are you coming? Uh, maybe. I gotta see what Hampton gives me. The workload can get heavy. Right. Let's keep this between us, yeah? Yeah, of course. I've never seen anything like it. Her face was a picture that day. "Hampton is starting to warm up to me." Finally felt like I got noticed. "Hard work is paying off." "Daisy... she's such a riot, so nice and personable. We're going to study together." "Hampton invited me over. It feels so good and cool to earn his confidence." ♪ Here I come ♪ How do I look? You look like a regular Crystal Dunn. Who? Exactly. Couldn't help yourself, could ya? Like mother, like daughter. I overheard Dean Michaels talking to Daisy. The police authenticated the video. They think somebody pushed Amy? - Shh! - Holy sh... Daisy's the only one that knows. You can't tell anyone. Okay. Yeah. Wow. So they think the killer could still be out there? Oh, my God. Well, nothing like a little outdoor sports with a killer on the loose to ease the stress. We don't know the killer's on the loose. Wanna come watch? Protect me? I can't. I gotta stay in. There's still so much work to do, but maybe I'll watch from the window. From the creepy window? The creepy window. Just go shoot some balls or score some goals, or whatever you do. Okay, well, text me if you need anything. Yeah. "Also, I told her she was wrong about Hampton." I felt pressure "to consider expulsion for the plagiarism." Plagiarism... that's twice that that's mentioned. Whoo-hoo! Let's go, guys! Nice work. Can you tell I haven't played since I was never? Showing up is more than half the battle here, so it looks good on you. And you'll get better. Thanks. Hannah didn't wanna come watch? She's writing, studying... The usual. The harder she works, the more talented she becomes. And the more boring, I might add. She's also a little rattled by... And, I mean, don't worry, I won't say anything to anyone... But she did tell me about the police update. She did? We've been best friends since we were little. It was written all over her face. She couldn't hide it. But don't worry, secret's safe with me. Promise. Just wanna keep the school from fully freaking out, you know? Yeah, totally. Amy and the journal and the murder... Journal? Amy's journal. We found it. It's safe, though. Did Hannah not tell you about it? No. Well, she meant to, I'm sure. Yeah, it was at the back of our closet. You're kidding. It's safe now, though. I only read a few pages, but it was mostly talk about the ethics of plagiarism or something. Anything about her working with Professor Hampton? He always had a thing for her. Really? We need to get that journal to Dean Michaels. Hey. Oh! Hey, Hannah. Just in time. I was just finishing up. Hey, how are you? Good. Are you sure? Sit down. Um... Can I talk to you about something? Of course. Rachel Garber said something odd... about Amy Hines... and you having a "type". Rachel said that? Yeah. Well, that's bizarre. Well, I barely know Rachel Garber. Amy, she was my T.A., but, Rachel, I... I don't really know her. But you and Amy got close? Yeah. Yeah, we were close. "Close" like... No. What happened with us, that... well, I don't do that. That's never happened before. I mean, look, I'm attracted to talent. I find talent to be the most attractive quality, and, you know, Amy, like you, was talented, but... nothing ever happened between us. Oh, that was a lot tougher than expected. Oh, no. I gotta run. Everything all right? Yeah, it's just something at the Innus dorm. I should go, but... how do you feel about returning these balls to the gym? Yeah, of course. Happy to. Thank you so much. You're the best. Okay. See you tomorrow. So, was she caught plagiarizing? I mean, she was a gifted and dedicated student. I certainly had no reason to suspect her of plagiarism. I found her journal. Amy had a journal? Yeah, which I need to turn in. What, you still have it? Have you read it? You have done nothing wrong, and I will support you as much as you would like me to. And I get it, with all of this going on, if you don't want to be my T.A., it's okay. And if you think that we went too far the other night, I get it. You know, we... we don't have to continue with this at all. No, I wanted to. I really admired your mind and... liked you. That's all past tense. Like you. Present tense. Mm. What am I signing myself up for? Hold that. Ah, yes. Dinner is ready. Dinner? Yeah, I ordered us something special. They don't deliver, so I've got to nip out and get it, but there are some assignments there that need marking, if you want to get started. Or, you know, you know where the typewriter is, if you feel inspired. And there's wine in the fridge. I'll be right back. Wonder if he has a charger... Charger... Charger... Where might a charger be? What? I hope you're hungry. Hey. Sorry. My phone is dead and I was looking for a charger. Okay, well, there's one in the kitchen. Um... I hate to do this, but I'm really not feeling well. Really? Uh, what's wrong? I've just kinda lost my appetite. Okay, well, uh, at least let me give you a ride. No. No, no, no. I'll be fine. I just got cramps, but I will see you in class tomorrow. Well, okay... and feel better. Thanks. Bye! I don't know what happened. I was just walking. Sorry, excuse me. Daisy? Oh, my God. What happened? We tried to call you. M-My phone's dead. What is it? There was an attack. Wait. Where's Jodie? I asked her to bring some gear to the gym, and she... She didn't make it. Hey, sweetie. It's a nice surprise. Hannah? Honey, what's wrong? So tell me that again. Like I said, I-I just remember being pushed onto the pathway, and then... and that's when I hit my cheek on the railing. Were you able to see them? Tell their size? Tall, for sure, but it was dark, so I don't know. Hannah? Honey, I got here as soon as I could. Just a minute. Any news? No, there's nothing yet. You must be Hannah's mother, Mrs. Marks. I'm Sonia Michaels, Dean of the school. Uh, Nancy. I'm sorry we're meeting under such terrible circumstances. Were you able to reach Jodie's parents? The authorities are in touch. Mrs. Marks? Excuse me. I'm Detective Mike Philips. I'm actually, well... I read your work and it's terrific. Ah. Well, thank you. You okay? Uh... It was your dorm room we went into, right? The one where Amy Hines stayed? Yes. Do you mind me asking what you were doing last night? Yeah. Um, I was helping Professor Hampton. We were at a Writers' Room. I'm his T.A. this semester. Writers' Room? Yeah, just... grading papers and stuff. Teacher's assistant duties. Are you aware that Amy Hines was also one of his teacher's assistants? Yes, I'm aware. I'm sorry. Who's Amy Hines? She was a student last semester. Fell out of her third-floor window, in what was thought to be a suicide, but now there's some doubt cast on that. Okay. Any further updates on that? Well, um, the video is definitely authentic, it's just too dark to see who pushed her out the window. Video? Someone released a video showing a figure pushing Miss Hines out the window. Excuse me. So it was a homicide? I'm afraid so. Do you have any reason to suspect that she might be targeted? Target Jodie? No. How are the two things connected? Well, two girls attacked on the same night, a suicide which turns out to be a homicide, all within the same dorm... It's a question that needs to be asked. Excuse me. Mom, I was gonna tell you. We're gonna go drop off my bags, and then we're gonna have a little chat. You have no idea the primal urge I have to take you out of here right now. What else haven't you told me, Hannah? Nothing. I know when you're keeping secrets from me. What is that? It's a journal belonging to Amy Hines. The girl? Why do you have it? I think she hid it here. I was gonna turn it in, but... But? I just didn't get a chance and... then I read something in it. "I told her she was wrong about Hampton." There was pressure to consider expulsion for the clear plagiarism. The confrontation turned tense, "bordering on violence." So who is she talking about? I don't know. But there is more that I need to tell you. Last night, when I was at Andrew's... Professor Hampton's Writers' Room... I found something in his drawer... Amy's student I.D. card. What? Why didn't you say anything? I was in shock! Everything happened at once... The I.D., and then Jodie and Daisy. Hannah! The police could charge you for withholding information. And you might as well just throw that journal on top of the pile, as well. What do I do? Were you and Andrew Hampton... intimate? What? No. God, no. Fine. Then the first thing we do is we find him. Why? Because that's what investigative journalists do. Unless you'd like to run straight to the police and tell them why you were withholding this information? No. Exactly. So... you want to be a journalist? You want to live by your own rules, follow your own hunches? Then let's go see where this leads us. Professor Hampton? Professor Hampton? So, this is the fabled Writers' Room? This is it. Okay, so where are the I.D. cards? He must have taken them. And why were you looking in his drawers? I'm his T.A. It just seems odd that he'd be so careless about something like that. Yeah. I know. Where to next? The celebration of life... It's right now. He's probably there. Thank you so much for coming. Those are such beautiful flowers. You want to sign right there. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Amy would've really appreciated it. Let's stick close together. Hey. Hannah. Hey. Daisy, this is my mom, Nancy. I'm such a big fan of your work, Mrs. Marks. I'm sorry we couldn't meet earlier. That's very kind of you. I'm sorry for everything that you're going through right now. How are you holding up? I-I can't stop thinking about Jodie. How I-I wished I'd never asked her to... There's someone out there and I am not okay with that. Hey, have you seen Professor Hampton today? Not since our last class, but it's interesting you say that, actually. Why? Well... seems like a convenient time to disappear. I-I should tend to the other guests. It was so lovely to meet you, Mrs. Marks. Nice to meet you, too, Daisy. Did you see that? The girl sending you daggers over there? I don't get her. What is it? Hannah? Hannah? Hannah! Hannah! Hannah, honey... Look, whatever it is, we'll get through this. Mom, I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Then just show me the text. Unless you want me to guess that you had an affair with Professor Hampton and you don't want to admit it? Hannah. God, I feel so stupid. Honey, no. Anyone in your position could've made the same choice. I mean, a handsome professor who passes himself off as some altruistic mentor... The Writers' Room was at his place. That's where Amy's I.D. was. I just feel so stupid. I shouldn't have... You are not stupid. You see the best in people, Hannah. There's nothing wrong with that. You got that from your dad. What's that? The last time I'm gonna hide something from you. Now that's my girl. You sure this isn't breaking and entering? You have a key, you have a right to go in and get your papers. Professor? Go and get the I.D. "Those that know," know I never set out to hurt anyone, but after pushing Amy too far in too many ways, I just... "couldn't take it anymore, I'm sorry." What? So you don't think it's odd that he typed up his own suicide letter? Odd? Maybe. Just... happens more times than not, just not on an old-fashioned typewriter. I'm sorry to ask this now, but that video on your phone... How long has that been going on? Just one stupid night. And you thought that hiding that from me would do, what? Were you protecting him? I was just... embarrassed. It... He's a predator and they prey on those that idolize them. Okay. Let's assume, as a thought experiment, that Professor Hampton was having an affair with Amy Hines. She wanted to cut it off and she threatened to report it... Right, so then he... took it into his own hands, charged her with plagiarism, creating a plausible scenario for her to take her own life. And the perfect set-up to throw her out a window. Detective, there's something outside here I need you to take a look at. Cold filters. Dark lipstick. Rachel Garber. What about her? She wears lipstick like that. Well, I guess I need to pay Rachel a visit. I should have just listened to you. About what? Going to USC instead of this place. Don't say that. I mean... no one could've seen this coming, including me. I just wanted to do it on my own, you know? I can't imagine the pressure you're under... but I'd be proud of you no matter what you did. And I know your father would've felt the same way. What if they don't find her? Oh, honey. She's strong. I should've been there with her. Oh, Hannah. Honey. When your dad died... I kept blaming myself for so long. I just thought if I could've just gotten the information and warned him... but you can't control what you can't control. I think you're still learning that. Yeah, I probably am. You are such a wonderful person. And you have so many good things coming to you. We're gonna fix this. You and Detective Philips seem to get along. Stop it. What? He's nice. I'm a professional. So is he. Just think, you guys could, like... solve word puzzles together and watch Sherlock reruns. Funny. Let's just... let's try to get through this alive. Yeah. Cold filters. Dark lipstick. There's this girl, Rachel Garber, she always had it for Amy. I barely know Rachel Garber. What does she have against her? Simple. She liked Amy, Amy didn't like her back. Amy, she was my T.A., but Rachel... I don't really know her. Rachel! Rachel! Wake up! Rachel! Hannah? I'm trying to sleep. Have you seen Rachel? Police were here earlier, asking the same thing. I saw her arguing with Professor Hampton yesterday, but haven't seen her since. What are you doing? Being nosy. Hannah? Hey. Sorry for waking you. What are you doing in here? I think Rachel did it. - What? - Look. This is her footage. Oh, my god. Apparently, she was arguing with Hampton yesterday, before she... Did you hear? Hear what? Hampton was found dead. Suicide. What? But-But... But it's a homicide, I swear, and it has to be Rachel. We have to get the Dean, the police... No, they already know. I have to get this to them. And the journal. Journal? Yeah, we found Amy's journal. Well, where are you going? To get my mom. Mom? Mom. Get dressed. We gotta go. What? Where are we going? Hannah? Honey. Where are we going? I have to hand this evidence into the station. Station? And what evidence? Hannah, slow down and tell me what's going on. That's Rachel Garber's laptop. Who? The girl who was staring at me. It has all the videos on there... Amy falling, me and Hampton... What? And I found gold cigarette filters with the same dark lipstick on them just outside her car. Like the ones they found at Hampton's? Yeah. - Okay, but why? - I don't know. Maybe it says in the journal. "Eventually reached a point where she got aggressive," threatening me, saying if I didn't keep silent, "she'd silence me." Who's she talking about? I don't know. "We went for a walk." Said that her entire career would be ruined and that I should just kill the story "and take the bribe." Who's she talking about? Does it say? No. - Mom. - Who's that? It's Rachel Garber. It's Rachel Garber. Hannah! Mrs. Marks? Nancy? Are you okay? Where's Hannah? Was she driving? Yes, she was driving. There... There was a computer... It was a journal and a computer. Rachel Garber. What about her? Hannah said she was behind everything. She tried to put us off the road. Well, that's a coincidence, 'cause Rachel Garber is M.I.A. Oh, my god. We have to find Hannah. Move slowly. "The three Ps," Ms. Marks... That's what every writer needs. You don't realize how cliche black boots are until you have to wear them, you know? Gold-filtered cigarettes... look familiar? Gold-filtered cigarettes... Highly addictive, wouldn't recommend them... But necessity is the mother of invention. Sorry about the whole running you off the road thing. I couldn't let you turn this in. Ah, yes... words on a page. "The primal pursuit of pen to paper." Getting sick of the "P" s? I'm not. How about... a little pyromania? What else do we have in today's goody-bag? "No devices. No laptops." And you... you just had to play Little Miss Journalist, didn't you? I'll admit, when I saw that the daughter of the famous Nancy Marks was enrolled here, I was excited. I really thought we would've worked on something together. But you just had to get carried away, didn't you? "Good morning, class," and Miss Marks... "You're so wonderful, your words are so moving." "Oh, me? Oh, shucks, professor!" "You're so handsome and smart, and I'm so talented... " Give me a break! Gold filter. Well, either this killer is very sloppy... or someone's trying to frame someone else. My late-husband and I used to do that. Do what? Finish each other's sentences. Oh. You actually remind me a bit of him. It's the East Coast accent. Wait. Do you hear that? Yes, I did. Jodie! Sweetheart! Are you all right? Who did this to you? Who put you in here? I saw... In black boots and gloves. Was it Rachel Garber? No. But I think I know who it is. You think you won that T.A. competition fairly? He chose you, just like he chose Amy. He likes them weak and vulnerable. It's why he never chose me, 'cause I'm strong. Oh, precious. It's not even a scratch. Not like what I did to Jodie. Enunciation, Miss Marks! Any last words you'd like to reveal to the class today? Why are you doing this? Why does anyone do anything, Hannah? Sometimes, we all have to make the brave and hard choice, even if we're scared. I thought you'd appreciate that. You're sick. You think I could have you or Jodie running around out there, knowing what you know? So you attacked her? I had to! You don't think Jodie would've told the world if she knew the truth? And you don't think I didn't notice her angling for my position? I know her type. She'd stop at nothing to get what she wanted. She would've said you were projecting. Too bad for her. Ah. Which suicide letter shall we choose today? I typed them freshly myself. Copied from the Internet. Wait... It was you. You plagiarized in class... That's what happened. And Amy caught on. She... She told you that she caught you cheating and she warned you to stop. I did not plagiarize. What are you talking about? It's literally the same syntax and thematic structure. You would've been expelled. Your career would've been ruined, so you pushed her and then you blamed Rachel. Poor girl. Her scream was horrible. Then, when that didn't work, you turned on Hampton. Wow! Some people really are more suited for investigative journalism. He was easy. Pathetic, really. Which brings us to our denouement. Such an elitist and pompous word. Let's reframe it. I prefer... "the end." Please! I can help you. How can you help me? What I need is to do well in school, a.k.a., not get expelled for something that was a mistake! You so much as make a sound, I will end you in the worst way possible. Hannah! Hannah? Hannah! Mom! Mom! It's Daisy! I don't know where she... I don't know where she is. It's okay. Mom! Come on! ♪ Hannah... ♪ ♪ Nancy... ♪ ♪ Where are you? ♪ That was a pretty good push. You're a lot stronger than I thought. I know you're in here. Come on, Nancy. I'm gonna find you. I know you're in here. Police! Drop it! Put it down! Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. So, she pushed Amy? And killed Hampton. She admitted everything. Detective Philips said that she, uh, she caused her own injuries. She punched herself in the face. She was crazy from the start. Crazy Daisy. You should trust your instincts. Hannah. Rachel? Turns out Miss Garber's been following this longer than we have. We thought you were missing. I know. Uh... Sometimes, it's just safer to keep your distance. Especially when it comes to Daisy. Look, I-I saw what she was doing, trying to peg it on me and-and Hampton. Uh, I got everything you need here, all the evidence. Ah. I'm really sorry for thinking that you were involved. Oh, it's fine, that's what Daisy wanted. I also had you totally wrong. Guess we both judged a book by its cover. Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna go down to the station, and process, uh, Miss Faulkner. I'll keep you posted. I'd like that. Me too. Great. Professor Hampton always talked about our "two sides". What we show... what we had... how the true self emerges when we stop fighting ourselves, allowing us to be free to take on real adversity, to face that which scares us the most. Guess who got voted into Student Union? What? That's awesome! Get someone else to carry your soccer balls, thank you very much. I'm really proud of you. I'd say you have big boots to fill, but... But that's creepy. Yeah. Our lives are meant to be lived, to fully experience the first four, the bittersweet, and even sometimes the sublime. Are there risks? Always! But a little heartbreak never killed you. It only makes you more alive, more ourselves. Like Jodie. Like Professor Hampton. Like my father. I hope the drive wasn't too long. Oh, it was lovely. It's nice to get out of the city, actually. Yeah, I bet. We can't take anything with us, but at least we can take the memories of those that helped us become who we are today... The mentors, friends, those we lost... the ones who made us "us". They're a part of us now and forever. Like chapters in our personal book of life... The duality of being human.
