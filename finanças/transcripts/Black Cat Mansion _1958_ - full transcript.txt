THE MANSION OF THE GHOSTCAT A Mitsugu Okura Production Starring Present Day Toshio Hosokawa Yuriko Ejima Period Drama Keinosuke Wada Ryuzaburo Nakamura Directed by Nobuo Nakagawa Hospital Wing 3 It's an evil night... those footsteps... No one but me has reason to come to this lab... ...but footsteps draw near from the direction I've come. Who is it walking down that dim hallway? Who else knows it well enough to walk it on a dark night? Of course I don't believe in ghosts. But at times we can be seized by a weird feeling... ...like the one I have now. Six years ago, something strange like that happened. My wife had tuberculosis, and needed a change of climate. We moved to the small town in Kyushu where she's from. We left Tokyo behind for a while. Her elder brother had arranged things for when we arrived. Does it hurt, Yoriko? I'm fine, Kenichi. Shouldn't she have an operation? This isn't the time. An operation could spread the bacilli further. We'll wait and see for now. I hate to see a man of your talent dragged way down here, though. I'm happy to work somewhere with clean air and a slower pace. What a scare! That was close. I'm sorry. A black cat ran right out in front of me. Did you hit it? No. It's fine. Good! It's in pretty bad shape. It's well over a century old. The shutters haven't been opened for years. Around here they call it 'the haunted mansion'. A haunted house in this day and age! Yoriko... ...shouldn't you wait in the car? I'd like to see the place, if I'm going to live here. What a mess! It gives me the shivers. They say crows gather where there's death. That's not true. They can smell it. I hate the noise they make. It's not very cheerful. A cat... It scared me half to death! I hate cats! Let's look inside. Tetsuichiro! What? There's someone there! No, there isn't. I'm sure there was! You're seeing things. Look! Footprints! A tramp, maybe. That's strange.. . they disappear. You're right. You're so high-strung... This place is so eerie! The living-room... These old places were sure built to last. You couldn't build like this now. That's right. Tetsuichiro! That looks like blood on the wall! It's not blood. We'll paint it over. Kuzumi Clinic Sort yesterday's files, would you? How are you, Yoriko? This rain depresses me. A big house is so dark when it rains... It'll stop. When it does, this place will be much better for you than Tokyo. It's like my brother said... this really could be a haunted house. Since I came I've been having strange dreams. Last night I dreamed of a weird old lady... Well, it's a new place... What's wrong with Taro? He doesn't usually bark like that. It's all nerves! No. He sounds strange. Taro! Taro! Quiet! Taro, stop it! Taro! You scared me! Don't sneak in like that! Can I help you? Don't you hear very well? You're soaking wet! I'll get the doctor. You wait here. Doctor... A patient. A really strange old lady. There's no one here. That's strange... I'll go look out front. She's not here. Who are you?! Yoriko! Yoriko! That weird old lady was in here! There's no one here. She was here! You imagined it. But the nurse said the same thing! You're seeing things. Don't get too excited. It's bad for you. Tetsuichiro! What's wrong? Can you hear footsteps? No. I can... it's that horrible old lady again! You're imagining things. And I'm here. Go back to sleep. I'm scared, Tetsuichiro! Who's there? A child's sick. The Sudos need the doctor over in Higashi Matsumura. The Sudos? Just a minute. Mr Sudo! Dr Kuzumi's here! Coming! Oh, hello, Doctor... We didn't call you, though... So nobody called the doctor? Maybe another house... No, she said here. I'm afraid not. It's me, Yoriko. Open the door. Yes? Hurry up! I'll catch my death of cold out here! Tetsuichiro? Yeah, it's me. That didn't take long. Wait while I open the gate. Taro! Taro! Taro? Taro! Taro! Yoriko! Yoriko! What's wrong? Yoriko! Wake up! Yoriko! Yoriko! Yoriko... Kenichi? Is that you? I was so scared! I keep having nightmares... All these cats come and start biting me... Don't try to talk. You'll tire yourself out. Lay back and sleep. But what if I start dreaming again? The doctor's here. Relax and go to sleep. How is she? She's fine now. But another shock like that could kill her. Really? I've been thinking... Yes? I'm told there are reasons they say this house is haunted. The priest at Ryofukuji Temple once told me... ...the best thing to do with this place was tear it down. I can't help but think there's a connection. The nurse saw an old lady, too. And then there's your dog... I'm wondering if you might come talk to the priest with me. It's just what I thought it was. It's a cat-spirit seeking revenge. A ghost cat? Yes. It's a tale of karma from long, long ago. On one side of the house was a bed of spiraea flowers. It was called 'Spiraea Mansion'. In it lived Ishido Sakon no Shogen, castle-warden of the Omura Clan. He was a man famous for his very short temper. Saheiji! Where are you?! Coming! Yes, Milord? Pick up those stones! Is Kokingo really coming? He's late! Where is he?! He won't be here yet, Sire. Why not? His lady mother is blind, you will recall. He must tend to her. Yes, I know that! Why do you cry so? I'll be home soon. Here, Mother. Take Tama. Kokingo... don't you feel she wants to tell you something? I have a bad feeling myself. Have no fear. I'm simply going to teach him the game of Go. But Lord Shogen is such a difficult person... Bear my words in mind... ... and hurry back. I will. I'll be going now. Be very careful. I will. Don't cry, Tama. I'll be back soon. What's keeping him?! What manner of samurai cannot be on time?! Have patience, Milord. Does he think his reputation as a Go master... ... allows him to scorn me?! Of course not, Milord. You see too much in this. Are you telling me... ...I don't know when I've been insulted?! Not at all! I mean only that you should calm yourself. Make sport of me and I'll have your head! Milord! Forgive me! Forgive me! Halt! Father, wait! Stand aside! I will not. Saheiji is a valued retainer. For my sake, spare him! No! Stand aside! Whatever he has done, it cannot be worth his life! Your temper is a matter of regret to me. Saheiji... at Shinnojo's request, your life is spared. Be careful! Milord! Now I can leave in confidence for the castle. You stand night watch? I do. Look to your duty. I will. Kokingo! Welcome. My father awaits. Angry that I'm late? You know him well. Be easy on him when you play. I am warned. Later we can talk a while... perhaps of your marriage. Tonight I stand night watch. That's too bad. Another time, then. Forgive me. Grandmother... Ah, Shinnojo... Yes. I have a favor to ask. What is it? Kokingo will play Go with Father today. I'm concerned Father's temper might make him impolite. I thought that a word to you before... It's not polite to your opponent to choose stones without asking! But I was asked to instruct you... Instruct me?! That is what Shinnojo said. He doesn't know how good I am. Today we play a game! Might I take back that stone? Not in a real game... No? All right! Tama... ... why do you wail so? Are you so Ionely without Kokingo? Your medicine, ma'am. Thank you. Kokingo is late. Yes. And he said he would return early. His opponent is a difficult man. I told him to let Lord Shogen win and to hurry home. But he's as stubborn as his father was. I pray nothing happens. I didn't see that move! Let me take back my stone! This is a game. Yes, I know, but... 'But'? Let me take back my move! I will not! Let me take that back! Milord! I will take my leave. Before the game is done? What is the meaning of this?! I will not play against a cheat! You dare use that word to one of my position?! I say it again. A cheat is a cheat! Silence! You disgrace your position! You insolent pup! What did you say?! You old fool! Halt! Pup! Villain! Milord! What's happened?! Saheiji! You cannot see this and live! Prepare yourself! Or will you help me? What will it be? Think well on it! I will. I'll help you! You are Kokingo's attendant? Yes, Milord. I am Hachirota. Go quickly and tell the Lady Miyaji... ...that Kokingo, mortified by his defeat at Go... ...has left immediately to study further in Kyoto and Osaka. He is a rash young man. Convey my regrets to his mother. Yes, Milord. Are you sure there is no mistake? Yes. Those are His Lordship's words. There is no mistake. Kokingo! Why do you appear as a corpse?! Who killed you? Who was it? Speak his name! Lord Shogen? Lord Shogen? Kokingo! Kokingo! Satsuki! Where are you?! Coming! Yes, ma'am? Tell me what this piece of cloth is. Blood! It bears the three-diamond crest! Shogen's crest? Then it's true! Lady Miyaji, you're as beautiful as ever. Seeing you now it seems like only yesterday... ...you were always in my thoughts. I'm sure Kokingo's leaving is a great disappointment to you. Lord Shogen... ...is it really true that Kokingo has left on a journey of study? Do you doubt my word? A samurai does not lie. And what is this, Lady Miyaji? Are you saying you do not know? I do not. What is it? Then I'll tell you. Kokingo's ghost has come to tell me you have killed him! A ghost?! I'm sure it was a dream. Great worry sometimes brings us strange dreams. Put your heart at ease. Will you drink with me? What do you say? Where's the harm in it? There's no one else here. Die! Have you gone mad? Revenge! Lady Miyaji... You filth! Hear me, Tama! Listen well! Kokingo, who was so good to you... ... has met cruel death... ... at the hands of Lord Shogen. And more, Shogen has violated my honor! I cannot bear to live! Hear me, for you are wise, beast though you are. Kokingo and I make this request of you. Avenge us on Sakon no Shogen and on his children, and theirs... ... until his line is extinct! This is the last thing I will ever ask you. Tama! Lap my blood, and imbibe my hate! Saheiji! Yes, Milord? It's blood! Quickly! Wipe it away! Who's there? Sato? I won't need you tonight. You may retire. You may not have use of me... ... but I have use of you. What?! Lady Miyaji! What brings you here at this hour of the night? Your Ladyship... ...Lord Shogen, without cause... ... has most cruelly cut down... ...my only son, Kokingo. And as well... ...though I am blind, he has abused my person. May the hatred I bear... ...curse the house of Ishido and all who bear its name... ... unto the last of its line! I know nothing of this! I know nothing of it! Lady Miyaji! I know nothing of this! Forgive me, Lady Miyaji! Yae... ...I have to pick the right time to ask Father to let us marry. You know that. Yes. I'm very happy, Shinnojo... ...but your father won't let you marry a woman of my station. Don't you understand how much I love you? Yes, but... ... I am not well-born. To be here with you like this is all the happiness... ...I need. Yae! Shinnojo! Yae! Yae! Yes? His Lordship wants you. I'll go to him now! This is a game. I do not play against cheats. Kokingo! Go back to hell! Who's there? Yae, Milord. I'm glad you've come. Enter. Yes, Milord. Will you massage my back? You're a very beautiful girl, Yae. You jest, Milord! Not at all! Come here... I mustn't, Milord! Please! Don't be so formal! There's no one else here. Keep your voice down! No! Please! Please! Marry Yae? Marry Yae? You are heir to this house! A 3, 000-koku samurai! Think of your position, you fool! Forgive my impertinence in disagreeing. We have pledged our love. I would not be the first to marry below my station. Grandmother gives her blessing. I ask you for yours. Shinnojo, you're old enough now not to go mad... ... over a woman! Father! Enough! Shinnojo... Grandmother... What did he say? I asked to marry Yae... ... and he got angry. Why would a great man like Shogen... ... do such a thing? Just because of her birth! Perhaps there's something else. Something else? Yes. It's rumored among the servants... ...Shogen summoned Yae to his chamber late at night. Yae?! No, Milord! Yae! Let go! Milord! Blood! Father! After what you said to me! What?! Kokingo! Father! Stand aside! Miyaji! Let go! Yae! Father! Yae! Yae! Speak to me! Yae! Fiend! Fiend! Blood! Who is it out there? Sato. If there's something you want, come in. You saw, didn't you. No, Milady! I thought you might be in distress! Liar! You've seen. I cannot leave you alive. Come to me! Forgive me! Yae! Mother took a carp from the pond and went under the house?! Yes, Milord. Those strange things last night, and now my mother... Saheiji! Tonight we'll go and look into this! It's Sato and Her Ladyship! Oh, Shogen... What brings you here at this hour? Silence, fiend! You killed my mother! Now you'll die! Fiend! Father! Why is your sword drawn? Have you seen anything strange? Speak! Kokingo! Go back to hell! Father! Are you mad?! Father! Father! What are you doing?! Father! Father! Milord! This is the story that has long been told of Spiraea Mansion. A frightening tale. But why is my sister involved? Yes. Why Yoriko? According to this Register of Deaths... ...Saheiji, the servant there, was your ancestor. Really? I've never told anybody that. Is that so? Cats have always been held to have magical powers. That's why I once said you should tear the place down. But vengeful spirits abhor the name of the Lord Buddha. I'll give you this charm. Hang it in your house. Thank you! Tetsuichiro, don't leave me. I won't. The nurse will watch the patients. And the priest gave me that charm. There's nothing to fear. When I was a girl, when I got sick... ...my mother would get a charm like that. It's strange, but I'd always get better. You're so superstitious! But if you get better, that's fine. Tetsuichiro! Yoriko! Calm down! I'm scared! Close the shutters! All right. Yoriko! Yoriko! Yoriko! Yoriko! Who is it? Who's there? Oh, it's you... I brought you some dinner. Thanks. Did it scare you when the power went out? Yes. I kept my eyes shut. But you got here... Tonight even I started thinking about that house down in Kyushu... That time? Yes. I thought you were dead. That certainly was strange. We buried the mummy and the old lady vanished. Hatred is a terrible thing. A cat! It's so cute! What, you like cats now? Can we keep it? Sure. Why not? The End
