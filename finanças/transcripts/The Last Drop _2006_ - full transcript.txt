[dramatic military music] [foreign language] [Morse code tapping] [Benitta] Source. Magdalen to Matchbox. Stop. Germans looting. Activity increased. Stop. [Military] By the authority of the Fuehrer, I hereby claim all properties? [Benitta] Have infiltrated SS as instructed. Now based at target. London, please advise. [foreign language] [squirting] [Benitta] Just fixing their lunch? [spits] [Saskia] Ready! [male voice in foreign language] [war siren] [distant bell ringing and plane humming] [knocking at door] [Warren] Come through, Captain Banks. Very impressive record. Italy, Belgium, North Africa, Dunkirk. Nobody's gonna win this war hiding in a foxhole. And tomorrow, you and your men are off to Holland. Operation "Market Garden" as part of the First Airborne Brigade. I'm not at liberty to discuss this. As of this moment, Captain, the parameters of the mission for you and your men have changed. [shuffling] Operation Matchbox. You will be leading the last drop. [dramatic music in crescendo] [music] [Banks] This rickety bugger's about to take us into the unknown, gentlemen. For those of you who don't know me there's only one rule in my command. Every man is a soldier, and I expect every soldier to do his duty without exception. We have a job to do, boys, so let's get it done. Good luck and God bless. I'll buy you all a beer when we get home. [McMillan] Thank you, sir. [Oates] Maintain course on 139, can you confirm? [Pilot over radio] Roger, Matchbox. Keep a steady course. Bit of a crosswind due east. Other than that, blue skies all the way. [music] Fresh coordinates, Lieutenant. [Pilot over radio] Roger, Matchbox, Breaking away from the pack on new heading. Due south, southeast on 279, over. I- zee's here? [Banks] And rendezvous here. [explosions] Chaps. I'd say we just about lost the element of surprise. Get this glider down, gentlemen, we're counting on you. [Banks] It's going to start getting a bit choppy, lads. Can I go home, sir? I've changed me mind. I left the gas on! [Banks] Put a bag on it, Ives. Your life's one big holiday. [shout over radio] [Pilot over radio] We've been hit! Losing altitude. Lost power on two. Matchbox, you're too hot to handle, release! Repeat, release! [Oates] Matchbox to Dakota, we are go for disengage. [Radio] Fire in the hold! We're going down! Thanks for the lift, good luck. Disengage, Simkins. [strains] Come on! It won't shift! [whipping] Brace yourself, Captain. Get us on the ground, fly boy! Yeah, I'm trying to keep my breakfast down. [McMillan] Right ladies, this is it! [shouting] Brace! Good luck, lads. [Soldier] Hold on! Hold on! [shooting] No! Get me hand! [screaming] Hold on, sir! Gonna try a landing! We're gonna land! [shouts in pain] Oh, my eyes! I can't see! [screaming] [shouting] [silence] [male and female sighs of pleasure] [Gustav] And now I would like to explore this particular avenue of pleasure. [loud clack and surprised gasps] [Gustav] How dare you! Gustav Handsfeldt, SS. Don't you know who I am? [Max] Clear. Voller. You are? so alive! And-and looking so-well! I'll? leave-you-gentlemen to your reunion. U hm, Gustav? I will see you next Thursday. I hope. Yes. Bye. [gasps] What's it like? Screwing a rat? [Voller] Tell us where it is hidden. It's all gone! The SS. took everything! I swear it! He's lying. But this? this is crazy! [laughs] We are old friends. We still are! You know it was not me who sent you to the Russian front? Shoot him. No, all right then! Everything is there! It's all hidden away. Somewhere near Arnhem. But you need me, you need me, Voller! You know that! You cannot kill me! Good point. [gunshot and shouts] [gasping] Now, I have all the necessary papers. You can't - you can't get through without me. Take him! Good. [Voller] I told you he would crumble. Yoo-hoo, when you finish congratulating yourselves? [Voller] Bravo, bravo. Thank you. Have you ever thought of taking it up professionally? The acting, I mean. Yes, as it happens, I have. A thousand Reich Marks per performance, remember? Yes, of course. Thank you, darling. He might still double-cross us. Of course he will. But he will be dead by then. I don't like him. [Katrina] I'll wait for you. Nothing personal, Gustav. Just business. Take care. [Simkins] It's my eye. [Banks] How are you boys in the cockpit? [Oates] Copilot needs attention. [McMillan] Check the perimeter. Come on, everybody out. Baker, how many you got? Two, Sarge. It's a bloody mess. [McMillan] It's a bloody mess! Try and hold still now, sir. [Banks] Simkins! Simkins! Get on to H Q, tell them we've missed the landing zone. Sir. Rally your troops, Sergeant. Sir. Did you manage to get a fix on our position, It? Somewhere in Europe, eh. We could be one, we could be twenty miles from the drop point. No, he's dead, Wellings. Just give me his tags. Good lad. [McMillan] Okay, rations, canteens. How are you doing, son? Right boys, take your weapons take your kits. We are after all, reputedly, the British army. [Banks] Seems to me if we missed the landing zone, we probably dropped over Jerry's head and right into his back garden. Oh, that's bloody marvelous! Have you ever seen any combat, It? Baptism by fire. Sir! Sir! I've got a signal? [shooting] [Banks] Everybody down! [shouting] [Banks] Everybody down! Return fire! [McMillan] Wellings, hit the deck, you plank! [much shouting and shooting] [Soldier] Need more ammo! [shouting] [McMillan] Right, on my mark, go! [Soldier] Ammunition! [Banks] Baker, with me! Covering fire, Sergeant! Stay with the men! Wellings, attend to the wounded! Hey, where's the corp gone? He's done a bunk! [two gunshots] [foreign language] [Banks] Took three of the buggers out. [McMillan] Well done, sir. [Banks] Powell! Where is he? Last seen running in the opposite direction of fire, sir! Baker, Wellings, Hayward. With me up the right. Sergeant, you take the Lieutenant up the left. Stay with these men, Sergeant. At all costs. [McMillan] Of course, sir. Good luck, sir. Contempt for death, gentlemen! Contempt for death! [Baker] Get up! Get up! Now! Out of the way! Move it! Stay with me! [much shooting and shouting] Reload! [Banks] Keep your shape, gentlemen! I can't go running! I can't go running! Fight on through, Wellings! [Banks] Baker! [Baker] I'm all right, Sarge! [whimpers] Covering fire, Wellings! I need cover! [Banks] On your feet, Sir! Talk to me! [Baker] I'm okay! Covering fire! Sarge! You all right? [McMillan] It's just in the leg! Keep moving, lads! I've got a jam. Medic! [German over radio] They are all dead, crash site clear. You shoot better than you fly. Lucky for you. Sarge, it's okay, hold on! I'm okay! More than I can say for your dancing career. Wellings! Medic! Coordinates to the Lieutenant. No sir, don't say that! You do that, sir! Stay in there, sir! Come on! Damn it! Our Father? hallowed be? Elizabeth! [Baker] What a bloody shame. [melancholy music] What are we gonna do, sir? You got a priest in there? [mumbles] Huh? Too late for him. You! Get out of here! Get out! I'm very sorry, sir. [foreign language] [Gustav] Ah, only your timing could be so apt. You survive the murder hole of the Russian Front you dodge a firing squad, lie your way across Europe? A deserter, a thief. And you get within 500 meters of the prize, the Allies invade. You have all the luck of a dead man. [groans] Remind me again! Why are we keeping him alive? Hans! We still need him! But there's a squadron of SS. led by a major. Kessler. Who's Kessler? Kessler is an old friend. He organized your Lieutenant's "winter holiday." Go back. Keep an eye on them. Did you not know? He has taken over Operation Libertine and now under Goering's official umbrella, he has expanded it somewhat. You said all we had to do was frighten the bookkeeper. Now it's Major Kessler, the SS. And the entire Allied invasion. What do you suggest we do after lunch, It? Kidnap Churchill? Nothing is as black as you paint it, Beck. No? [Max] They're pulling out! You see? All things come to those who wait! [Max] Heading this way. [Beck] The bookkeeper! Come here! [Gustav] Major! Major! And to think, Sergeant, we've only just met. [groans] Stupid! No sense of humor. [McMillan] Tighter. Pull it tighter, you plank. Shall I get the morphine? No, you hit me with any of that gear, I'll be sparko for over a month. Not if we give you it little by little. Stick it up his arse. [McMillan] What are you offering, jock? No one touches me with impunity, sunshine. We have to move out. What's the Sarge gonna do with a bum leg? Hop? We'll leave the sergeant here. Carry on with our objectives. Report his position. With what, Tonto? Smoke signals? The radio's knackered. No one is getting dug in. We move out together as a unit and you, Powell! When I want your bloody opinion, I'll ask for it. All right? [McMillan] Who's got the map and orders? Map's only any use when you know where you are. [McMillan] Take a gander. Lieutenant! All due respect, Sergeant, he's not army regular. [Oates] What? And you are? [Baker] We don't have time for this. Just 'cause I'm all right with a peashooter, don't make me a team leader. I'm a pilot, for Chrissake. Flying what? Kites? Well, Canada, looks like you got the job, son. You've got seniority so start bleeding using it. God help us. [McMillan] Right then, ladies. Pack up your troubles. We're moving out. [groans] We're due to go to Miami Beach. Hope you don't mind. [foreign language] Happy? Beck! Bring the bookkeeper. The soup-is excellent! My compliments. [Voller] We are here to look for certain items. I think you know what I am referring to. You're wasting your breath. These are two dirty collaborators, they work for the highest bidder. There was a husband but? [laughs] You know Kessler, he likes his women single. All right, bookkeeper, talk. Before we get down to specifics, what is the deal? I let you live. [bookkeeper groans] [music] Clear. [Gustav] These buttons need to be pushed in sequence. Punch in the wrong one, boom! Blown to Berlin. If there anything unpleasant waiting for us down here I'll kill you before you can blink. [clack] This way. I think we got ourselves a situation here, Sarge? Oi, beat it. According to my calculations, battle is going on over here. Following these coordinates, we're heading in the complete opposite direction. Whatever our objective is, died with Capt. Banks. Thought you were here to take a bridge. These orders are directing us to a target in the middle of nowhere, what kind of assignment are you on? I dunno, Canada, you tell me, I ain't got the foggiest. Two days ago before kick-off, I was reassigned Dennis Baker. Bomb disposal and boy, does he have some previous. Wellings, last time he fought a round was back in basic. Oh, he's got a bit of medical training though. Speaks a dozen languages. He's fallen straight into Airborne? Oh no. That ain't right. Us being here is no accident. Yeah, this is all ass backwards. Yeah. What about pretty boy Powell? What's his beef? What, the ice cream? First time I ever clapped eyes on him was when he stepped onto the glider. You're kidding me. No. I'll tell you, that boy knows more than he's letting on. Certainly acting like no corporal I've ever met. You know how I figure it? I think when Banks bought the farm, he left the kid carrying the can. Since we're on a need to know basis I figure he don't think we need to know. Yes. For now, we're just slowing him down. Any rate, keep running in this direction, we should walk slap bang into the Americans. [Yankee Doodle melody] Move it up! Move it up! Woo-hoo! Inform HQ, we've taken the bridge. [Colt] Just don't tell 'em how easy it was. You got a cigarette? [Soldier] Yeah. Ain't no Kraut gonna set foot on the far shore under my watch. At this rate, we'll make Berlin before Monty or Patten. [shooting] It's a hell of a war, Jack. H uh, you can say that again. I say, it's a hell of a war, Jack. Don't you got something to do? Oh yeah. [laughs] [shooting] [Gustav] You call this a getaway car? Where did you steal this bucket of rust? What we need is a truck. I can get you a truck in Arnhem. And I also have a contact in Switzerland who because it is me, well, he will give us a good deal, yes? So. What do you say? Equal shares? What about Max? Do we really need him? I'm surprised at you. Oh! [soft music] I know your face. North Africa, Royal Engineers, Black Watch. Horrible time, it was. You get sand in places you never knew you had. Listen, pal, you didn't cop a look at those movement orders when you passed 'em on from the Captain? Do me a favor, Private. What's that, then? Don't talk to me. Ever. I'm sorry about what happened back at the crash. I just froze. And you saved my life. What are you gonna do? Give me a kiss? Do I look like a sailor? No, sir. Listen, son, you're not in school now, you don't have to call everybody sir. No, sir. How long have you been with Airborne? 1941, Judge said this or two years in chokey. Supposed to be over by Christmas. They've been throwing me out of airplanes ever since. Been with McBastard since day one. I don't know who gets on his pip more, me or the Jerries. It's not how I'd imagined. I don't know, I thought? thought it'd be more heroic. Maybe I'd win a medal. Listen, son. You have to shoot people. What are you gonna do when the Bosch turn up? Wave your thermometer at 'em? Blind 'em with your Latin? You wanna win a medal? I'll give you a little pearl. Someone has a pop? you have a pop back. [Oates] Bogey, eleven o'clock! [Ives] Oh no! [Baker] Move down! [Powell] Make for the treeline! [Powell] Sarge, move it! [Ives] Come on, Sarge! Coward! [Ives] At this range, might as well be spitting on him. [Ives] Come on, Sarge, on your feet! [Baker] He's coming round again! [Ives] He's coming round again! Sarge? Sarge! [Ives] Come on, Sarge! [McMillan] Just stay where you are! Get off! [Ives] Come on, Sarge! [shooting] [Ives] Move it, you ugly? [Ives] Wellings! What are you doing? Wellings, where are you going? Stay there, Wellings! Private, you get back here! [shouting] [Ives] Wellings, you'll never pick him up! [Oates] Come on, run! Five bob says he makes it. Ten bob says he don't. [Ives] Wellings, run! [music] [shouting] Wellings-you're a bloody fool. [Oates] But a brave one, eh? [McMillan] Wellings, don't you ever disobey a direct order again. Or I'll have you up on charges, you beautiful little boy. [happy laughing] Gentlemen, when we finish congratulating ourselves the pilot has probably given our position away which means we have one hour headstart. [Oates] That's if he makes it. We need to keep moving. [Oates] We hit him! [Powell] Lieutenant. [Oates] He ever let up? He's losing fuel. All right, lads. You heard the corporal. [Ives] Come on, you big berk*. * Fool. Back on your heads. [Wellings] Steady on, sir. [Oates] I missed you back there. Turn around, you're gone. [McMillan] Right. Picnic's over. Keep your eyes out. I know you asked me never to speak to you again. But you do owe me ten bob. Yeah? Take it outta that. [soft piano music] [Kessler] What is to report? Colonel Dorffman is confident he will drive the allies back. The colonel's confidence is admirable if a little misplaced. I promised the Fuehrer his prize. I gave him my word, he will accept nothing less. The Fuehrer holds a special place for you in his heart. You have an enviable position in the SS. Ja, it would be a tragedy to have it cut short by a firing squad. Make the necessary arrangements for the transportation of the merchandise. [Kessler] It must be in Berlin before the Allies take Holland. Do not fail me. [clicks heels] [explosions] [church bell slowly ringing] [Gustav sobbing] Don't kill me, please. [gunshot] Run. Now it was Kessler who betrayed you, not me. Run! You took your time. Where's our friend? I let him go. Good. Did you find a truck? Yeah. But I couldn't take the risk of driving it through. The place is surrounded by troops. We will wait till nightfall when our Panzer division arrive. The infantry will be pulled back, so when the shelling begins? we use the barrage as cover to slip through. What about the checkpoints? Gustav Hansfeldt, SS. That's nice. The fog of war. What better time for a robbery. To Switzerland. Switzerland. [music] For liberation. For us. I will be back before dawn. [music] I brought you bread and some wine. [soft piano music] You could come into the house. So could Kessler. I wanted to say thank you. For what you did. Those guards you shot? they were? I am very grateful. [Ives] Pint of bitter, a fish supper. Bit of slap and tickle down the Palace. [McMillan] Oh, do shut up, Ives. [Ives, sings softly] Outside the lunatic asylum when I was picking up stones jumps a loony, says to me "Morning-" [Oates] Sarge. Powell's gone. So are the orders. [click] [Oates] Drop it, scout. And the .38. You too-lady. [Oates] They're in here! So what? Took a little walk in the moonlight? Rendezvous with your sweetheart? Afraid you might get lost. Took the map and coordinates with you, right? [McMillan] On your knees! Wellings, secure that weapon. [Oates] All right, enough of the horseradish. Now what the hell is going on, Powell? If that is your name. [Powell] It's classified. I'll classify a bullet right up your posterior unless you start talking right now. I don't think you will. Not if any of you want to get home. What's with the charade? It's classified, top secret. Which means if it all goes belly-up no-one's the wiser. [Powell] Quite possibly. Oh, this is bollocks! Do you speak German? He's a Nazi spy. We pop him and go home. [foreign language] What is she saying? In English. She's telling us to be quiet. Inform her we're Matchbox. Sarge? Go on then. [foreign language] If you are "Matchbox", I am "Source Magdalen". [McMillan] Ives, door. How many Germans at the target location? Only one. But more are expected tomorrow. We do not have much time. Where's Jan? Jan is dead. And you are late. [McMillan] Late for what? What are we late for, pal? I'm with Military Intelligence. S O E. Under the cover of Operation Market Garden. My directives are to intercept a VIP bound for Berlin. VIP? What VIP? That's classified. Myself and Captain Banks were to rendezvous with a source from the Dutch Resistance. Wellings here will translate. 'Cause he speaks the lingo. What about the rest of my lads, Powell? We needed cover to get in. We're the cannon fodder. No! No! Look. What's being asked of all of you is extremely vital for the war effort. Help me make the rendezvous. I'll do the rest. You believe him? Why don't we suck it and see? [explosions and shooting] [British Captain] Contact H Q, tell them we've taken the transportation depot. [Voller] Ceasefire. All right, spread out, stay alert. [breathless] British. Now. Now what? Invisible cloaks? Wait. [loud buzzing] [British Captain] Incoming! [British soldier] Take cover! Returning fire! Tank support's arrived. German efficiency. Bang on time. Okay. Let's go. [shouting and explosions] [explosion and scream] We're being over-run! Retreat! Pull back! [German soldier] Halt! [Beck] Let's get out of here! [music] [Gustav] They held me at gunpoint. Tortured me for information of the location. Then they dumped me in the middle of a war zone. If your brave men had not found me, I may have starved to death. [Kessler] How many men run with him? [Gustav] Oh, sir, well, four or five of them. I- I managed to kill a couple before they overpowered me. Now there's? just a sniper farmhand and this mad psychotic thing called Beck. I don't think he likes me. We should have killed Voller when we? Do not say that name to me. The SS have latitude to do many things. Murdering lieutenants in the German army is not one of them. At least not without good reason. But Major, Voller has betrayed us. He is a liar. And a thief. Ja. Herr Major? far be it for me to tell you your duty but? should not we be in pursuit? [gasps] Gustav, by tomorrow evening, you, I and the entire shipment will be in Berlin. There are only two possible routes to the farm. As of 1800 hours, one here is in the hands of the Americans. But the other here are all troops are defending with excessive zeal and resilience! [Gustav breathes deeply] Given that the combined British American forces cannot break through, what chance of a rogue lieutenant and his band of thieves? [loud electric guitar music] Wake up. Wake up, minefield up ahead. What? Which way? Right. No, no! Left. Are you sure? Trust me, left. [tires screech] Er, hang on, I think? Oh! [music] [flapping of bird's wings] No, Fritz. 'Cause that would piss me right off. All clear! Hands up where I can see 'em! Gun down, hands up! Schnell! Good boy. Now over here? come on, left, right, left, right. I know you lot march, I've seen you on the wireless. [loud thud] Aye, aye. Who's a crafty little Nazi? You enjoying this, eh? Hang on. Blimey, this how Adolf pays you a lot? I'm on the wrong side. Where'd you get this? Eh? Vie getten sie dis? [Powell] Ives, bring the prisoner outside. Sir! Right. There we are, sir. Bit frisky. But he's all right now. How would you like to meet a British Officer? [Wellings] Let's get you inside now, sir. And take a look at that leg. [McMillan] Powell, you got the squad. [Ives] Here we are, sir. H is gun's up there, he's been frisked and cleaned. And now he's me best mate. [Powell] Secure him upstairs. Sir. Move! Baker, with me. Everybody else? get in the house. Later on, me and you are gonna have a nice little chat. Come on! Raus! Is it them? Well, it is definitely one of our trucks. Why don't you get out and take a look? Put our minds at ease. [explosions] Here? Now? Of course. Yes, it's the mad psychotic Beck! [thud] [motor starts up] Major, what are you doing? You have a choice. I shoot you now or I leave you as I found you, lying through your teeth in the middle of nowhere. Which will it be, hm? I, I swear. Oh, no, no, Major, please! Please. Major! Major! [motor fades away] Shit. [1st American soldier] Well, lookie here. [2nd soldier] Hey Sarge, check that guy. [1st soldier] Hands up. [3rd American soldier] We got ourselves a porker, sir. God bless Uncle Sam. I should have left you for the Cossacks. Left me? Who pulled who from the burning truck? Who's idea was it to drive through a minefield in the first place? Well, I have seen men get the Iron Cross for less. I'm sure they will let you wear it when they hang us both. You would have died 10 times over if it were not for me. I was as good as dead from the moment we met. You steal the treasure from under Kessler's nose and he gets a bullet from the Fuehrer. Look me in the eye and tell me? Look me in the eye? and tell me this is not just about revenge. Out of my way-Lieutenant. Where are you going? Anywhere you are not! Then they will shoot you for desertion! They can only kill me once. Beck! This was not an order from High Command. This was a business proposal! All right, so I wanted to get my own back on Kessler. But that does not mean we can't get rich into the bargain! Hans! You do not walk out on your partner halfway through a deal! Hans, it's? You do? [distant explosions and chirping] You see, I knew you were smart. I knew it! The Americans! [Yankee Doodle Dandy melody] This whole plan is? [Voller] I am telling you, it will work. You just need to be a little less? Less what? German. Think cowboy. [American accent] How you doin', ma'am? [American accent] Yes, sir! Yes, sir. Try it with me. Yes, sir. Yes, sir! Yeehaw! Heehaw. Yahoo! Yeehaw! Hee-haa! Heehaw! Hee-haw. How do I sound? Like Hans from Duesseldorf. We are dead. Heehaw! [Gustav] We are talking about millions here. Priceless artifacts, antiques. Rare coins, paintings. All taken by the SS. [Gustav] Those Nazi swine are ruthless, ja? The interesting thing is that there are only three people who know about it. Now, that's you, that's me, and the kind Lieutenant here. That's enough. [Soldier] Yes, sir. You still got those cigars? Yeah, there's a couple left. Give him one. [Gustav] Oh, oh. Thank you. You trying to get at something, mister? Well, America's the land of opportunity, ja? So, surely if the spoils of war should? just happen to? fall into the brave hands of such good men as yourselves. [Colt] You trying to cut yourself a deal? No, look, no, I? I prefer to think of it as a "business" proposition. Hey, soldier. Give this guy a light. Thank you. Get him out of here. Eh? Yes, but we will discuss? Let's go, buddy. That's it. What do you make of all that? [Shannon] It's getting interesting. You can say that again. It's getting interest? [Powell] Can you defuse it? [Baker] If you stop breathing down my neck, you see, if you cut the wrong wire? Ever play Russian roulette, Corporal? See, this job requires experience nerve and a hell of a lot of stupidity. [snip] I've had enough. See? this is not a bright and shiny VI P, is it, Corporal? Just do your job. I'll be outside, just in case. Oh, it's time out, is it, Corporal? I can smell it off you. [sigh] My name is Bobby. Bobby Oates. I'm from Windsor, you know? It's just near the Detroit border. Some hot water. I don't understand. There was definitely some morphine left! It was in here. I distinctly remember it being here. You're taking the piss, aren't you? No, Sarge. Christ's sake. [Benitta] There is schnapps. I'm not drinking bloody Kraut nonsense. [Oates] 90 proof. [Wellings] Bite on this, sir. Just like my great granddad used to make? [McMillan] All right, I'll have some of that, then. [Wellings] That's not gonna help at all. Yeah, it will. There'll be a sudden surge of pain. If you could lie down, sir. Make his head comfortable. [Oates] Schnapps. [Wellings] Lie down, sir. Make his head comfortable. Lie down, sir. [McMillan] Oww! [Wellings] Now this is gonna really hurt. [gasps in pain] Hold him down. Very good. [shouting in great pain] Look at that. Clark Gable. [distant shouts of pain] That's what we do to our own. Can you imagine what we're gonna do to you, Fritz? [distant loud shout] Fancy a smoke? No? Please yourself. [music] [McMillan] Get that bullet out of my leg! Now listen. [foreign language] All right. We don't have to be nasty. You and me could be mates. Eh? "Matenzes." This is so beautiful. Where'd you get this? Hey, hey, hey. You were saying? Green? Or green? [Colt] So Gustav, what you're telling me is you put this whole shebang together? The stolen art treasures, the booby-trapped barn, eh? [Gustav] Yes, it is therefore because of me alone that I will take you to the plunder. I think we can get some help from It. Shannon. I have been planning this for years. [Voller] If we have to talk, I talk. Looks like you two took a beating. Where you headed, soldier? Oh, wait, I gotta get clearance. Whoa, fellas, wait, wait. I said wait. Who's side are you on? You don't cross until I-get the okay. I get clearance, you get auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen? Yeah, that's Kraut, for "Get the hell out of here." Auf Wiedersehen. [in German] Danke shon. Whoa, what unit you say you were from? [Voller] Go! Do I have a choice? [Colt] Hold your fire. Hold your fire! What the hell's going on? They're Germans! Two day pass for anybody who brings me the heads of those two sons of bitches! [Voller] That was close! What happened to Gustav? [Shannon] He slipped away. God damn it! God damn it! [Voller] Get off the road! Which way? You looking for, the scenic route? Go left! I think we need to go right! Left! Trust me, left! [foreign language] Next time, I say we head for Switzerland. We head for Switzerland. [loud humming] Oh no! Quick! Get out! Out! [tapping] [bird cries out] Say, er? last night in the forest? that Jan was, was, was he your? My husband. Geez, I'm sorry. Do you have a family? Someone special? Well, I? I got a lot of "someones," you know. Er, but, er? no-one special. Well, at least not yet anyway. [snap] Corporal Powell. The man with a plan. Feel like sharing it? Just stay alert. [sighs] You know, pink suits you. Baker, what the hell do you think you're doing? Drinking. Why? What you gonna do? Put me up for court martial again? I've been burnt, blew up, I've been busted back to private. So what are you gonna do! Sober up. I need you focused. Sobered up? Let me show you something they don't teach you at Sandhurst. Oh, big guy. [Oates] Holster that weapon! Sarge. [Oates] Holster your weapon. Keep out of this, It. What kind of soldiers are you? Powell! You're here to liberate us, not get drunk and shoot each other. What's the difference? A bullet or a bomb? Put it away. Put it away. [clicks tongue] Put it away. [clicking] Good boy. Enough of this VIP crap. What's in the goddamn barn? [Oates] Tell us all what is so important it's worth the lives of 25 men and don't you give me any of that king and country bullshit! [Ives] We know what's down there, don't we, Fritz? This ain't no cloak and dagger job. We're here-on the rob. Come on. Thank you. [Beck] Now what, genius? Plan B? Fill our pockets and run like thieves? [Voller] We are not leaving without the lion's share. We'll wait for something to happen. And when it does? We pounce. That's your plan? Yeah. So, we're here to steal the Nazi loot. [Benitta] The Germans have stripped our country bare. In a few hours, it will all leave for Berlin. There's an impregnable strongroom underneath the barn. Baker's job is to get us in there. Never gonna happen. [Oates] If we can't defuse it, then we blow it up. How long to do that? Re-route the circuits. Blow it from a distance. Done in no time. No, those are not the orders from London. You heard the lady, we're on the clock with this, blow it. No offence. None taken. Canada, have you lost your bleedin' mind? Are you talking about blowing up a ton of loot? Who care who gets it? As long as it isn't Hitler. Oi, muggins, we can't get to it. It's booby-trapped. Booby-trapped, my ass. Laughing boy here is supposed to be an expert. Look son, no-one's interested. Really? So when you're back home wobbling on what's left of that leg of yours and your wife and kids are starving on your disability pension, you'll say to yourself "We did the right thing there, blowing up a king's ransom." I'm not a thief. I'm an opportunist. Wellings, you got a say in this? I haven't got any children. [Powell] We access the payload, retrieve it then as per instructions divert it to British soil. Wait, divert? You said "secure" not "divert." That's a different matter. He was gonna nick it anyway. All I'm saying is that if we dip into this it's mission accomplished, Whitehall's happy, you're still serving king and country and no one can ever ask after it because it's top secret. And we all come out of this with something other than bullet wounds and boring war stories. And I'll be honest. You'll get no help from me without it. Whatever you decide, make it quick. Kessler will be here soon. He'll become suspicious if there are no guards. Still haven't answered my question. How do you expect to divert this cargo? [Powell] They're sending a seaplane to take it to Berlin. The mission and orders are to steal it. I say we blow it to kingdom come with him in it! I can't do this by myself. [Powell] Who's with me? [music] [dramatic music] Heil Hitler! No wonder we are losing the war. [Snyder] Take all of this to the jetty. This is genuine Vermeer. [foreign language] N ice and easy, lads. Let's make these square heads feel at home. Sh. [loud clicking] [Ives] Five men, four men? three men, two men. One man and his dog, Spot. [sings] Went to mow some Jerries. [muffled complaint] [Saskia] Sorry. Stay here till I get back. [foreign language] [humming of plane] [Voller] The pilot. The pilot is our way in. Or rather out. [foreign language] Heil Hitler? Uh-huh. Find a way of getting aboard that plane. What are you going to do? Settle a score. I thought you wanted to get rich, not even. Okay. Do not leave without me. The thought never entered my head. [Colt] Frank, right. Yes, sir. Dean, left. Right on it, sir. Sammy, put that mortar right there. Yes, sir. Looks like that prisoner was telling the truth after all. Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let any Nazi bastard steal one nickel out of this country. [music] [Ives] Aw, Christ's. Come on now, pal. You blow that bloody whistle like a good gentleman. No, no, no. Psst, Baker! Baker, we're gonna go early. We're going early. You need to be ready for the signal. What about him? Get out of the line, Corporal. No, you dopey posh, git, get out of the way. [Kessler] Voller. You, close the lift shaft. Prepare for an attack! Full alert! I knew I should have joined the bloody Navy. [music and shooting] [foreign language] [Saskia] Wait. [Max] Keep down. Come on. Come on. [music in crescendo] Smile! [shooting] [Benitta screams] Saskia! Jesus Christ's! [McMillan] Baker! Keep your head down! [McMillan] Get your head do-! [Baker] Agh! Jesus! [McMillan] Baker! You want some? Well, come on then! [McMillan] Ives, where are you? Ives? Are you all right? Shift yourself, Corporal Powell. [motor hums] Hello, Klaus. How could you betray me? We were brothers! We are brothers. What happened to you? [grunts and groans] [Kessler] You-betrayed-yourself. Ranging fire. One round. [quick footsteps] [click of gun] [whispers] Where are you? [Kessler] Come on I Where are you? [Kessler] We put our guns down, Britisher, and fight. [whispers softly] Come on. [labored breathing] [Kessler] That was close, ja? [footsteps] Very good. There you go. [heavy breathing and loud thud] [Kessler] No! No! Come back here, you coward! No! Open fire. It's all right. I'm with the British Intelligence. I've got to destroy this barn. [explosion] Let's get out of here, soldier. [American accent] Yes, sir. Who the bloody hell's that? Some yank. [American Sergeant] Move, move, move! [shouting of instructions to soldiers] [American Sergeant] Whoa, check your fire! [McMillan] Come on! Quick as you can! [Ives] Got your passport? Why are they shooting at us? Because we're in a German plane, you berk! Powell, move! Shift yourself! [shouting] Where is Max? [Ives] Come on, Powell! [Colt] Out him down! Got that one. [McMillan] Nearly there, son. [McMillan] Come on, Powell I Move it! [Ives] Come on, Powell! [Ives] Bloody hell! [Ives] Powell, no! [Soldier] Oh, we got him! We got him! [Ives] Go, go, go! What the hell are you waiting for, a taxi? Go and tell the units to do whatever the hell they gotta do. Come on! Move it out! Let's go home, Jack. Yes, sir. [labored breathing] [crunch] [metal clang] Snyder? Herr Major. Gustav. You're alive. Thank God. Open the door. Oh, what a coincidence, Herr Major. We meet again. Open the door immediately! Step back, please. Auf Wiedersehen, Gustav. At last, Herr Major. [deep groan] [explosion] [big explosion] [Wellings] No, it looks far worse than it is. Baker not with us? [McMillan] No, he didn't make it, son. Who's the yank? I thought he was with you, sir. How's it going, mate? [Benitta screams] [McMillan] Hold it right there! Hold it right there! Put the tool-! [Ives] Shoot and you go first! Put it down! I said I'll shoot you in the face! [Beck] Lower your guns! I said I'll shoot you in the grille! [Beck] I'm gonna kill him! It's getting kinda hard to concentrate with all this shouting. How you doing? [McMillan] Put the gun down. [Voller] You first. You first. [McMillan] Don't be a child! Put the bloody gun down! No. I have been planning this since 1941. Oh, no, me old china. You lot been planning since you invaded Poland. It's a question of what's fair. [Ives] Fair's a place where you win goldfish, son. This property should be returned to its rightful owners. [Ives] You got a list, love? [McMillan] Let's try and be sensible. We've all just won. We're not going to shoot. Nobody wants to get hurt. We just want-an equal share. [explosion and shouts] [McMillan] Whoa, whoa! Calm down! Calm down! [Ives] Put him down! What's happening? Fire in No. 2 engine. Brace yourselves, we're going down. [Benitta] Take my hand. [Ives] Brace yourself, mate. [McMillan] Brace yourself, sunshine. Hold on tight. [McMillan] You're all right. [Ives] I don't believe this, Canada. I've only flown with you twice and both times you've crashed! [Oates] Anybody see a lake down there? [melancholy music] [McMillan] 'Shun! Stay with the men. [Ives] We could have been rich as Solomon. [McMillan] Oh, belt up, Ives. It was for king and country. Come here. [Ives] Baker never did give me that ten bob. I still don't know if Powell was his real name. [Male guide] Heroic brave British troops risked their lives to save these priceless Dutch treasures from falling into the hands of Nazi Germany. [distant voice] Now, if you would like to follow me? [music] [hissing] [glass breaking and alarm goes off] Next stop? Switzerland. [Colt] Hell of a war, Jack. [chuckles] [dramatic music]
