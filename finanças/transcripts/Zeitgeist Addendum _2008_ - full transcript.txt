The old appeals to racial, sexual or religious chauvinism, to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work. the business of who I am and whether I'm good or bad, or achieving or not, All that's learned along the way. It's just a ride... And we can change it anytime we want. It's only the choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. I realised I had the game wrong. The game was to find out what I already was. We were seeing how very important it is to bring about, in the human mind, the radical revolution. The crisis is a crisis in consciousness. A crisis that cannot, anymore, accept the old norms, the old patterns, the ancient traditions. And, considering what the world is now, with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality, aggression, and so on... Man... is still as he was. Is still brutal, violent, aggressive, acquisitive, competitive. and, he's built a society along these lines. Society today, is composed of a series of institutions. From political institutions, legal institutions, religious institutions. to institutions of social class, familiar values, and occupational specialization. It is obvious, the profound influence these traditionalized structures have in shaping our understandings and perspectives. Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into, directed by and conditioned upon, there seems to be no system as taken for granted, and misunderstood, as the monetary system. Taking on nearly religious proportions, the established monetary institution exists as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is. How money is created, the policies by which it is governed, and how it truly affects society, are unregistered interests of the great majority of the population. In a world where 1% of the population owns 40% of the planets wealth. In a world where 34,000 children die every single day from poverty and preventable diseases, and, where 50% of the world's population lives on less than 2 dollars a day... One thing is clear. Something is very wrong. And, whether we are aware of it or not, the lifeblood of all of our established institutions, and thus society itself, is money. Therefore, understanding this institution of monetary policy is critical to understanding why our lives are the way they are. Unfortunately, economics is often viewed with confusion and boredom. Endless streams of financial jargon, coupled with intimidating mathematics, quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it. However, the fact is: The complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask. Designed to conceal one of the most socially paralyzing structures, humanity has ever endured. A number of years ago, the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve, produced a document entitled Modern Money Mechanics. This publication detailed the institutionalized practice of money creation, as utilized by the Federal Reserve and the web of global commercial banks it supports. On the opening page, the document states its objective. The purpose of this booklet is to describe the basic process of money creation in a 'fractional reserve' banking system. It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process through various banking terminology. A translation of which goes something like this: The United States government decides it needs some money. So it calls up the Federal Reserve and requests, say, 10 billion dollars. The FED replies, saying: Sure, we'll buy ten billion in government bonds from you. So the government takes some pieces of paper, paints some official looking designs on them and calls them treasury bonds. Then it puts a value on these bonds to the sum of 10 billion dollars and sends them over to the FED. In turn, the people of the FED drop a bunch of impressive pieces of papers themselves. Only this time, calling them Federal Reserve notes. Also designating a value of ten billion dollars to the set. The FED than takes these notes and trades them for the bonds. Once this exchange is complete, the government then takes the ten billion in Federal Reserve notes, and deposits it into an bank account. And, upon this deposit, the paper notes officially become legal tender money, adding ten billion to the US money supply. And there it is, ten billion in new money has been created. Of course, this example is a generalization. For, in reality, this transaction would occur electronically, with no paper used at all. In fact, only three percent of the US money supply exists in physical currency. The other 97 percent essentially exists in computers alone. Now, government bonds are by design, instruments of debt. And when the FED purchases these bonds, with money it essentially created out of thin air, the government is actually promising to pay back that money to the FED. In other words, the money was created out of debt. This mind numbing paradox, of how money or value can be created out of debt, or liability, will become more clear as we further this exercise. So, the exchange has been made. And now, ten billion dollars sits in a commercial bank account. Here is where it gets really interesting. For, as based on the fractional reserve practice, that ten billion dollar deposit instantly becomes part of the bank's reserves, just as all deposits do. And, regarding reserve requirements as stated in Modern Money Mechanics: A bank must maintain legally required reserves equal to a prescribed percentage of its deposits. It then quantifies this by stating: Under current regulations, the reserve requirement against most transaction accounts is 10 percent. This means that with a ten billion dollar deposit, ten percent, or one billion, is held as the required reserve, while the other nine billion is considered an excessive reserve, and can be used as the basis for new loans. Now, it is logical to assume, that this nine billion is literally coming out of the existing ten billion dollar deposit. However, this is actually not the case. What really happens, is that the nine billion is simply created out of thin air on top of the existing 10 billion dollar deposit. This is how the money supply is expanded. As stated in Modern Money Mechanics: Of course they, the banks, do not really pay out loans for the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes, loan contracts, in exchange for credits, money, to the borrowers' transaction accounts. In other words, the nine billion can be created out of nothing, simply because there is a demand for such a loan, and that there is a 10 billion dollar deposit to satisfy the reserve requirements. Now let's assume that somebody walks into this bank and borrows the newly available nine billion dollars. They will then most likely take that money and deposit it into their own bank account. The process then repeats. For that deposit becomes part of the bank's reserves. Ten percent is isolated, and in turn, 90 percent of the nine billion, or 8.1 billion is now availlable as newly created money for more loans. And, of course, that 8.1 can be loaned out and redeposited, creating an additional 7.2 billion to 6.5 billion, to 5.9 billion, etc. This deposit money creation loan cycle can technically go on to infinity. The average mathematical result is that about 90 billion dollars can be created on top of the original 10 billion. In other words, for every deposit that ever occurs in the banking system, about nine times that amount can be created out of thin air. Money jitters. Ask the obliging Bank of America for a jar of soothing instant money. M-O-N-E-Y in the form of a convenient personal loan. So, now that we understand how money is created by this fractional reserve banking system. A logical, yet illusive question might come to mind: What is actually giving this newly created money value? The answer: The money that already exists. The new money essentially steals value from the existing money supply. For the total pool of money is being increased, irrespective to demand for goods and services. And, as supply and demand defines equilibrium, Prices rise, diminishing the purchasing power of each individual dollar. This is generally referred to as inflation. And inflation is essentially a hidden tax on the public. What is the advice that you generally get? And that is, inflate the currency. They don't say: debase the currency. They don't say: devalue the currency. They don't say: Cheat the people who are safe. They say: Lower the interest rates. The real deception is when we distort the value of money. When we create money out of thin air, we have no savings. Yet there is so-called capital. So, my question boils down to this: How in the world can we expect to solve the problems of inflation? That is, increase in the supply of money, with more inflation. Of course, it can't. The fractional reserve system of monetary expansion is inherently inflationary. For the act of expanding the money supply, without there being a proportional expansion of goods and services in the economy, will always debase a currency. In fact, the quick glance of the historical values of the US dollar, versus the money supply, reflects this point definitively, for the inverse relationship is obvious. One dollar in 1913 required $21.60 in 2007 to match value. That is a 96% devaluation since the Federal Reserve came into existence. Now, if this reality of inherent and perpetual inflation seems absurd and economically self-defeating, hold that thought, for absurdity is an understatement, in regard to how our financial system really operates. For in our financial system, money is debt, and debt is money. Here is a chart of the US money supply from 1950 to 2006. Here is a chart of the US national debt for the same period. How interesting it is, that the trends, are virtually the same. For the more money there is, the more debt there is. The more debt there is, the more money there is. To put it a different way, every single dollar in your wallet is owed to somebody by somebody. For remember: The only way the money can come in to existence is from loans. Therefore, if everyone in the country were able to pay off all debts, including the government, there would not be one dollar in circulation. In fact, the last time in American history, the national debt was completely paid off was in 1835, after President Andrew Jackson, shut down the Central Bank that preceded the Federal Reserve. In fact, Jackson's entire political platform essentially revolved around his commitment to shut down the Central Bank. Stating that one point: The bold efforts the present bank has made to control the government... are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the American people, Should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or, the establishment of another like it. Unfortunately, this message was short lived. And the international bankers succeeded to install another central bank in 1913, The Federal Reserve. And as long as this institution exists, perpetual debt is guaranteed. Now, so far we have discussed the reality that money is created out of debt through loans. These loans are based on a bank's reserves, and reserves are derived from deposits. And through this fractional reserve system, any one deposit can create 9 times its original value. In turn, debasing the existing money supply, raising prices in society. And, since all this money is created out of debt, and circulated randomly through commerce, people become detached from their original debt. And a disequilibrium exists, where people are forced to compete for labor, in order to pull enough money out of the money supply to cover their costs of living. As dysfunctional and backwards as all of this might seem, there is still one thing we have omitted from this equation. And it is this element of the structure which reveals the truly fraudulent nature of the system itself. The application of interest. When the government borrows money from the FED, or when a person borrows money from a bank, it almost always has to be payed back with a crude interest. In other words, almost every single dollar that exists must be eventually returned to a bank, with interest payed as well. But, if all money is borrowed from the Central Bank and is expanded by commercial banks through loans, only what would be refered to as the principal is been created in the money supply. So then, where is the money to cover all of the interest that is charged? Nowhere. It doesn't exist. The ramifications of this are staggering, for the amount of money owed back to the banks will always exceed the amount of money that is available in circulation. This is why inflation is a constant in the economy, For new money is always needed to help cover the perpetual deficit build into the system, caused by the need to pay the interest. What this also means, is that mathematically, defaults and bankruptcy are literally built into the system. And there will always be poor pockets of society that get the short end of the stick. An analogy would be a game of musical chairs, for the once music stops, somebody is left out to dry. And that's the point. It invariably transfers true wealth for the individual to the banks. For, if you are unable to pay for your mortgage, they will take your property. This is particularly enraging when you realize, that not only is such a default inevitable due to the fractional reserve practice. But, also because of the fact that the money that the bank loaned to you didn't even legally exist in the first place. In 1969, there was a Minnesota court case involving a man named Jerome Daly, who was challenging the foreclosure of his home by the bank, which provided the loan to purchase it. His argument was that the mortgage contract required both parties, being he and the bank, each put up a legitimate form of property for the exchange. In legal language, this is called consideration. Mr. Daly explained that the money was, in fact, not the property of the bank. For it was created out of nothing, as soon as the loan agreement was signed. Remember what Modern Money Mechanics stated about loans? What they do, when they make loans, is to accept promissory notes, in exchange for credits. Reserves are unchanged by the loan transactions. But, deposit credits constitute new additions to the total deposits of the banking system. In other words, the money doesn't come out of their existing assets. The bank is simply inventing it, putting up nothing of it's own, except for a theoretical liability, on paper. As the court case progressed, the bank's president, Mr. Morgan, took the stand. And in the judge's personal memorandum, he recalled that the Plaintiff, bank's president, admitted that, in combination with the Federal Reserve Bank did create the money and credits upon its books by book-keeping entry. The money and credit first came into existence when they created it. Mr. Morgan admitted that no United States Law or Statute existed which gave him the right to do this. A lawful consideration must exist and be tendered to support the Note. The Jury found that there was no lawful consideration and I agree. He also poetically added: Only God can create something of value, out of nothing. And, upon this revelation, the court rejected the bank's claim for foreclosure and Daly kept his home. The implications of this court decision are immense. For every time you borrow money from a bank, whether it is a mortgage loan or a credit card charge, the money given to you is not only counterfeit, it is a illegitimate form of consideration. And hence, voids the contract to repay. For the bank never had the money as property to begin with. Unfortunately, such legal realizations are suppressed and ignored. And the game of perpetual wealth transfer and perpetual debt continues. And this brings us to the ultimate question: Why? During the American Civil War, President Lincoln bypassed the high interest loans offered by the European banks and decided to do what the Founding Fathers advocated. Which was to create an independent and inherently debt-Free currency. It was called The Greenback. Shortly after this measure was taken, an internal document circulated between private British and American banking interests, stated: Slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborers, while the European plan... is that capital shall control labor by controlling wages. This can be done by controlling the money. It will not do to allow the Greenback, as we cannot control that. The fractional reserve policy, perpetrated by the Federal Reserve which has spread, in practice, to the great majority of banks in the world, is, in fact, a system of modern slavery. Think about it, money is created out of debt. And what do people do when they are in debt? They submit to employment to pay it off. But if money only can only be created out of loans, how can society ever be debt free? It can't and that's the point. And it is the fear of loosing assets, coupled with the struggle to keep up with the perpetual debt and inflation inherent in the system, compounded by the inescapable scarcity within in the money supply itself, created by the interest that can never be re-payed, that keeps the wage-slave in line, running on a hamster wheel, with millions of others, in effect, powering an empire that truly benefits only the elite at the top of the pyramid. For, at the end of the day, who are you really working for? The banks. Money is created in the bank and invariably ends up in a bank. They are the true masters, along with the corporations and governments they support. Physical slavery requires people to be housed and fed. Economic slavery requires people to feed and house themselves. It is one of the most ingenious scams for social manipulation ever created. And at its core, it is an invisible war against the population. Debt is the weapon used to conquer and enslave societies, and interest is its prime ammunition. And, as the majority walks around, oblivious to this reality, the banks, in collusion with governments and corporations continue to perfect and expand their tactics of economic warfare, spawning new bases, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, while also inventing a new type of soldier. The birth of the economic hitman. We, economic hitmen, really have been the ones responsible for creating this first truly global empire And we work many different ways. But perhaps the most common is that we will identify a country that has resources our corporations covet, like oil, And then, arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or one of it's sister organizations. But the money never actually goes to the country. Instead it goes to our big corporations, to build infrastructure projects in that country. Power plants, industrial parks, ports... Things that benefit a few rich people in that country. In addition to our corporations. But really don't help a majority of the people at all. However, those people, the whole country is left holding the huge debt. It's such a big debt they can't repay and that's part of the plan... They can't repay it. And so, in some point, we economic hitmen, go back to them and say: Listen. You owe us a lot of money. You can't pay your debts. So, sell your oil, real cheap to our oil companies, allow us to build a military base in your country, or... send troops in support of ours to someplace in the world like Iraq, or vote with us on the next UN vote, to have their electric utility company privatized and their water and sewage system privatized and sold to US corporations or other multi-national corporations. So there is a whole mushrooming thing and it's so typical the way the IMF and the World Bank work. They put a country in debt, and it's such a big debt, they can't pay it, and then you offer to refinance that debt and pay even more interest. And you demand this quid pro quo, what you call a conditionality or good governance which means basically that they got to sell off their resources, including many of their social services, their utility companies, their school systems sometimes, their penal systems, their insurance systems, to foreign corporations. So it's a double-triple-quadruple whammy! The precedent for economic hitmen really began back in the early 50's when the democratically-elected Mossadegh who was elected in Iran... He was considered to be the hope for democracy in the Middle East and around the world. He was in Time Magazine's Man of the Year. But, one of the things that he brought on and began to implement was the idea that foreign oil companies needed to pay the Iranian people a lot more for the oil that they were taking out of Iran and the Iranian people should benefit from their own oil. Strange policy. We didn't like that, of course. But we were afraid to do what we normally were doing, which was to send in the military. Instead we sent in one CIA agent, Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt's relative. And Kermit went in with a few million dollars and was very, very effective and efficient and in a short amount of time, he managed to get Mossadeg overthrown and brought in the Shah of Iran to replace him, who always was favorable to oil. And it was extremely effective. Mobs over through Tehran. Army officers shout that Mossadeg has surrendered and his regime as virtual dictator of Iran is ended. Pictures of the Shah are paraded through the streets as sentiment reverses. The Shah is welcomed home. So back here in the United States, in Washington, people looked around and said: Wow, that was easy and cheap. So this established a whole new way of manipulating countries, of creating empire. The only problem with Roosevelt was that he was a card-carrying CIA agent and if he'd been caught, the ramifications could have been pretty serious. So very quickly, at that point, the decision was made to use private consultants to channel the money through the World Bank or the IMF or one of the other such agencies, to bring in people like me, who work for private companies. So that if we got caught, there would be no governmental ramifications. When ?rbenz became President of Guatemala, the country was very much under the thumbs of United Fruit company, the big international corporation. And ?rbenz ran on this ticket that said: You know, we want to give the land back to the people. And once he took power, he was implementing policies that would do exactly that, give the land rights back to the people. United Fruit didn't like that very much. And so, they hired a public relations firm, launched a huge campaign in the United States, to convince the United States people, the citizens of the United States, the press of the United States and the congress of the United States, that ?rbenz was a Soviet puppet And that if we allowed him to stay in power, the Soviets would have a foothold in this hemisphere. And at that point in time, there was a huge fear on everybody's mind, of the Red terror, the Communist terror. And so, to make a long story short, out of this public relations campaign came a commitment on the part of the CIA and the military to take this man out. And in fact, we did. We sent in planes, we sent in soldiers, we sent in jackals, we sent everything in to take him out. And did take him out. And as soon as he was removed from office, the new guy that took over after him basically reinstated everything to the big international corporations, including United Fruit. Ecuador, for many many years had been ruled by pro-US dictators, often relatively brutal. Then it was decided they will have a truely democratic election. Jaime Roldos ran for office and his main goal, he said, as president would be to make sure that Ecuador's resources were used to help the people. And he won. Overwhelming. By more votes than anybody had ever won anything in Ecuador. And he began to implement these policies. To make sure that the profits from oil went to help the people. Well, we didn't like that in the United States. I was send down as one of several economic hitmen to change Roldos. To corrupt him. To bring 'em around... To let him know... You know. Okay, you know, you can get very rich, you and your family, if you play our game. But if you continue to try to keep this policy you've promised, you're gonna go. He woudn't listen... He was assassinated... As soon as the plane crashed, the whole area was cordoned off. The only people allowed there were US military from a nearby base and some of the Ecuadorian military. When an investigation was launched, two of the key witnesses died in a car accidents before they have a chance to testify. A lot of very, very strange things that went on around the assassination of Jaime Roldos. I, like most of people who've really looked at this case, have absolutely no doubt that it was an assassination. And, of course, in my position as an economic hitman, I was always expecting something to happen to Jaime, whether it'd be a coup or assassination, I wasn't sure, but that he would be taken down because he was not being corrupted, he would not allow himself to be corrupted the way we wanted to corrupt him. Omar Torrijos, the president of Panama, was, you know, one of my favorite people. I really really liked him. He was very charasmatic. He was a guy who really wanted to help his country. And when I tried to bribe him or corrupt him, he said: Look, John... He called me Juanito... He said: Look Juanito, I don't need the money. What I really need is for my country to be treated fairly. I need for the United States to repay the debts that you owe my people for all the destruction you've done here. I need to be in a position where I can help other Latin American countries win their independence and be free of this, of this terrible presence from the north. You people are exploiting us so badly. I need to have the Panama Canal back in the hands of the Panamian people. That's what I want. And so, leave me alone, you known, don't try to bribe me. It was 1981 and in May, Jaime Roldos was assassinated. And Omar was very aware of this. Torrijos got his family together and he said: I'm probably next, but that's okay, because I've done what I came here to do... I renegotiated the Canal. The Canal will now be in our hands, we just finished negotiating the treaty with Jimmy Carter. In June of that same year, just a couple of month later, he also went down in an airplane crash, which, there's no question, was executed by CIA sponsored jackals. A tremendous amount of evidence that one of Torijjos' security guards handed him, at the last moment, as he was getting on the plane, a tape recorder. A small tape recorder that contained a bomb. It is intersting to me how this system has continued pretty much the same way for years, and years, and years, except the economic hitmen have gotten better and better and better. Then we coped with, very recently, what happened in Venezuela. In 1998, Hugo Chavez gets elected president, following a long line of presidents who'd been very corrupt and basically destroyed the economy of the country. And Chavez was elected amidst all that. Chavez stood up to the United States and he's done it primarily demanding that Venezuelian oil be used to help the Venezuelian people. Well... we didn't like that in United States. So, in 2002, a coup was staged, which was no question in my mind, in most other peoples' minds, that the CIA was behind that coup. The way, that that coup was fomented was very reflective of what Kermit Roosevelt had done in Iran. Of paying people to go out onto the streets, To riot, to protest, to say that Chavez was very unpopular. You know, if you can get a few thousand people to do that, television can make it look like... It's the whole country and things start to mushroom. Except in the case of Chavez, he was smart enough and the people were so strongly behind him, that they overcame it. Which was a phenomenal moment in the history of Latin America. Iraq, actually, is a perfect example of the way the whole system works. So, we, economic hitmen, are the first line defense. We go in, we try to corrupt the governments and get them to accept these huge loans, which we then use as leverage to basically own them. If we fail, as I failed in Panama with Omar Torrijos, and Ecuador with Jaime Roldos, men who refuse to be corrupted, then the second line of defense is we send in the Jackals. And the Jackals either overthrow governments or they assassinate. And, once that happens and a new goverment comes in it... Boy, it's gonna toe the line because that new president knows what will happen if he doesn't. In the case of Iraq, both of those things failed. The economic hitmen were not able to get through to Saddam Hussein. We tried very hard, we tried to get him to accept a deal very similar to what the House of Saud had accepted in Saudi Arabia, but he wouldn't accept it. And so the Jackals went in to take him out. They couldn't do it. His security was very good. After all, he, at one time, had worked for CIA. He'd been hired to assassinate a former president of Iraq and failed, but he knew the system. So, in '91, we send in the troops and we take out the Iraqi military. So, we assumed at that point that Saddam Hussein is gonna come around. We could have take him out, of course at that time, but we didn't want it. He's the kind of strong man we like. He controls his people. We thought he could control Kurds, and keep the Iranians in their border and keep pumping oil for us. And that once we took out his military, now he's gonna come around. So, the economic hitmen go back in in the 90's without success. If they'd had success... he'd still be running the country. We'd be selling him all the fighter jets he wants, and everything else he wants, but they couldn't, they didn't have success. The jackals couldn't take him out again, so we sent the military in once again, and this time, we did the complete job and took him out. And in the process, created for ourselves some very, very lucrative construction deals to reconstruct the country that we'd essentially destroyed. Which is a pretty good deal if you own construction companies, big ones. So, Iraq shows the three stages. The economic hitmen failed there. The Jackals failed there. And as a final measure, the military goes in. And in that way, we've really created an empire, but we've done it very, very subtly. It's clandestine. All the empires of the past were built on the military, and everybody knew they were building them. The British knew they were building them, the French, the Germans, the Romans, the Greeks, and they were proud of it. They always had some excuse like spreading civilization, spreading some religion, something like that, but they knew they were doing it. We don't. The majority of the people, in the United States, have no idea that we're living off the benefits of the clandestine empire. That today there is more slavery in the world than ever before. Then you have to ask yourself, well, if it's an empire, then who is the emperor? Obviously our presidents of the United States are not emperors. An emperor is someone who is not elected, doesn't serve a limited term, and doesn't report to anyone, essentially. So you can't classify our presidents that way. But we do have what I consider to be the equivalent of the emperor and it's what I call the corporatocracy. The corporatocracy is this group of individuals who run our biggest corporations. And they really act as the emperor of this empire. They control our media, either through direct ownership or advertising. They control most of our politicians because they finance their campaigns, either through the corporations or through personal contributions that come out of the corporations. They're not elected, then they don't serve a limited term, they don't report to anybody, and at the very top of the corporatocracy, you really can't tell whether the person is working for a private corporation or the government because they're always moving back and forth. So you know, you've got a guy who, one moment is the president of a big construction company like Haliburton, and the next moment, he's Vice President of the United States. Or the President, who was in the oil business. And this is true whether you get Democrats or Republicans in the office. You have this moving back and forth through a revolving door. And in a way, our government is invisible a lot of the time, and his policies are carried out by our corporations on one level or another. And then again, the policies of the government are basically forged by the corporatocracy, and then presented to the government and they become government policy. So, there's an incredibly cozy relationship. This isn't a conspiracy theory type of thing. These people don't have to get together and plot to do things. They all basically work under one primary assumption, and that is that they must maximize profits, regardless of the social and environmental costs. This process of manipulation by the corporatocracy through the use of debt, bribery and political overthrow is called: Globalization. Just as the Federal Reserve keeps the American public in a postion of indentured servitude, though perpetual debt, inflation and interest, the World Bank and IMF serve this role on a global scale. The basic scam is simple. Put a country in debt, either by it's own indisgression, or through corrupting the leader of that country, then impose conditionalities or structual adjustment policies often consisting of the following. Currency devaluation. When the value of a currency drops, so does everything valued in it. This makes indigenous resources available to predator countries at a fraction of their worth. Large funding cuts for social programs. These usually include education and health care. Compromising the well-being and integrity of the society, leaving the public vulnerable to exploitation. Privatization of state-owned enterprises. This means that socially important systems can be purchased and regulated by foreign corporations for profit. For example, in 1999, the World Bank insisted that the Bolivian government sell the public water system of it's third-largest city to a subsidy of the US-corporation Bechtel. As soon as this occured, waterbills for the already impoverished local residents skyrocketed. It wasn't until after full-blown revolt by the people that the Bechtel contract was nullified. Then there is trade liberalization, or the opening up of the economy, through removing any restrictions on foreign trade. This allows for a number of abusive economic manifestations, such as transnational corporations bringing in their own mass-produced products, undercutting the indigineous production and ruining local economies. An example is Jamaica, which after accepting loans and conditionalities from the World Bank lost it's largest cash crop markets due to competition with Western imports. Today countless farmers are out of work, for they're unable to compete with the large corporations. Another variation is the creation of numerous, seemingly unnoticed, unregulated, inhumane sweatshop factories, which take advantage of the imposed economic hardship. Additionally, due to production de-regulation, environmental destruction is perpetual as a country's resources are often exploited by the indifferent corporations, while outputting large amounts of deliberate pollution. The largest environmental lawsuit in the history of the world, today is being brought on behalf of 30,000 Ecuadorian and Amazonian people against Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron so it's against Chevron, but for activities conducted by Texaco. They're estimated to be more than 18 times what the Exxon Valdez dumped into the Coast of Alaska. In the case of Ecuador, it wasn't an accident. The oil companies did it intentionally; they knew they were doing it to save money rather than arranging for proper disposal. Furthermore, a cursory glance at the performance record of the World Bank reveals that the institution, which publicly claims to help poor countries develop and alleviate poverty, has done nothing but increase poverty and the wealth-gap, while corporate profits soar. In 1960, the income-gap between the fifth of the world's people and the richest countries, versus the fifth in the poorest countries was thirty to one. By 1998, it was seventy-four to one. While global GNP rose 40% between 1970 and 1985, those in poverty, actually increased, by 17%. While from 1985 to 2000, those living on less than one dollar a day increased by 18%. Even the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress admitted that there is a mere 40% success rate of all World Bank projects. In the late 1960's, the World Bank intervened in Ecuador with large loans. During the next 30 years, poverty grew from 50% to 70%. Under or unemployment grew from 15% to 70%. Public debt increased from 240 million to 16 billion, while the share of resources allocated to the poor went from 20% to 6%. In fact, by the year 2000, 50% of Ecuador's national budget had to be allocated for paying its debts. It is important to understand: the World Bank is, in fact, a U.S. bank, supporting U.S. interests. For the United States holds veto-power over decisions, as it is the largest provider of capital. And where did it get this money? You guessed it: It made it out of thin air through the fractional reserve banking system. Of the world's top 100 economies, as based on annual GDP, 51 are corporations. And 47 of that 51, are U.S.-based. Walmart, General Motors and Exxon, are more economically powerful than Saudi Arabia, Poland, Norway, South Africa, Finland, Indonesia and many others. And, as protective trade barriers are broken down, currencies tossed together and manipulated in floating markets and State economies overturned in favor of open competition in global capitalism, the empire expands. You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America, there is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their counsels of state? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, min and max solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. The World is being taken over by a hand-full of business powers who dominate the natural resources we need to live, while controlling the money we need to obtain these resources. The end result will be world monopoly, based not on human life, but financial and corporate power. And, as the inequality grows, naturally, more and more people are becoming desperate. So the establishment was forced to come up with a new way to deal with anyone who challenges the system. So they gave birth to the 'Terrorist'. The term 'terrorist' is an empty distinction designed for any person or group, who chooses to challenge the establishment. This isn't to be confused with the fictional 'Al Qaida', which was actually the name of a computer database of the U.S.-supported Mujahadeen in the 1980's. In 2007, the Department of Defense received 161.8 billion dollars for the so-called global war on terrorism. According to the National Counter-Terrorism Center, in 2004, roughly 2000 people were killed internationally due to supposed terrorist acts. Of that number, 70 were American. Using this number as a general average, which is extremely generous, it is interesting to note that twice as many people die from peanut allergies a year, than from terrorist acts. Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America is coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year. And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for research on this issue was about three billion dollars. This means, that the US government, in 2007, spent 54 times the amount for preventing terrorism, than it spent for preventing for the disease, which kills 6600 times more people annually, than terrorism does. Yet, as the name terrorism and Al Qaida are arbitrarilly stamped on every news report, relating to any action taken against US interests, the myth grows wider. In mid 2008, the US Attorney General actually proposed, that the US congress officially declare war against the fantasy. Not to mention, as of July 2008, there are now over 1 million people currently on the US terrorist watch list. These so called Counter-Terrorism Measures, of course had nothing to do with social protection and everything to do with preserving the establishment amongst the growing anti-American sentiment, both domestically, and internationally, which is legitimately founded on the greed-based corporate empire expansion that is exploiting the world. The true terrorists of our world, do not meet at the darks at midnight or scream Allah Akbar before some violent action. The true terrorists of our world, wear 5000 dollar suits and work in the highest positions of finance, government and business. So, what do we do? How do we stop a system of greed and corruption, that has so much power and momentum? How do we stop this aberrant group behavior, which feels no compassion, for say, the millions slaughtered in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the corporatocracy can control energy resources and opium production for Wall Street profit. How do we stop a system of greed and corruption that condemns poor populations to sweatshop slavery for the benefit of Madison Avenue? Or that engineers false-flag terror attacks for the sake of manipulation? Or that generates built-in modes of social operation, which are inherently exploited? Or that systematicly reduces several liberties and violates human rights, in order to protect itself, from it's own shortcomings? How do we deal with the numerous covert institutions, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Group and other undemocratically elected groups which behind closed doors collude to control the political, financial, social and environmental elements of our lives? In order to find the answer, we must first find, the true underlying cause. For the fact is, the selfish, corrupt, power and profit-based groups are not the true source of the problem. They are symptoms. My name is Jacque Fresco. I'm an industrial designer and a social engineer. I'm very much interested in society and developing a system that might be sustainable, for all people. First of all, the word 'corruption' is a monetary invention, that aberrant behavior, behavior that's disruptive for the well-being of people. Well, you're dealing with human behavior. And human behavior appears to be environmentally determined. Meaning, if you were raised by the Seminole Indians as a baby, never saw anything else, you'd hold that value system. And this goes for nations, it goes for individuals, for families, they try to indoctrinate their children to their particular faith and their country and make them feel like they're part of that. And they built a society, which they call established. They established a workable point of view and tend to perpetuate that. Whereas, all societies are really emergent, not established. And so they fight new ideas that would interfere with the establishment. Goverments try to perpetuate that which keeps them in power. People are not elected to political office to change things. They are put there, to keep things the way they are. So you see, the bases of corruption is in our society. Let me make it clear. All nations then, are basically corrupt because they tend to uphold existing institutons. I don't mean to uphold or downgrade all nations, but communism, socialism, fascism, the free enterprise-system and all other sub-cultures are the same. They are all basically corrupt. The most fundamental characteristic of our social institutions is the necessity for self-preservation. Whether dealing with a corporation, a religion or a government, the foremost interest is to preserve the institution itself. For instance, the last thing an oil company would ever want is the utilization of energy, that was outside of it's control. For it makes that company less relevant to society. Likewise the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union was, in reality, a way to preserve and perpetuate the established economic and global hegemony of the United States. Similarly, religions condition people to feel guilty for natural inclinations, each claiming to offer the only path to forgiveness and salvation. At the heart of this institutional self-preservation lies the monetary system. For it is money that provides the means for power and survival. Therefore, just as a poor person might be forced to steal, in order to survive, it is a natural inclination to do whatever is needed to continue an institution's profitability. This makes it inherently difficult for profit-based institutions to change, For it puts in jeopardy, not only the survival of large groups of people, but also the coveted, materialistic lifestyles associated with affluence and power. Therefore, the paralyzing necessity to preserve an institution, regardless of its social relevance is largely rooted in the need for money or profit. What's in it for me?, is why people think. And so if a man makes money selling a certain product, that's where he's going to fight the existence of another product that may threaten his institution. Therefore, people cannot be fair. And people do not trust each other. A guy will come over to you and say, I've got just the house you're looking for, he's a salesman. When a doctor says, I think your kidney has to come out, I don't know if he's trying to pay off a yacht or that my kidney has to come out. It's hard in a monetary system to trust people. If you came into my store and I said, this lamp that I've got is pretty good, but the lamp next door is much better, I wouldn't be in business very long. It wouldn't work. If I were ethical, it wouldn't work. So when you say industry cares for people, that's not true. They can't afford to be ethical. So your system is not designed to serve the well-being of people. If you still don't understand that, there would be no outsourcing of jobs if they cared about people. Industry does not care. They only hire people because it hasn't been automated yet. So don't talk about decency and ethics, we cannot afford it and remain in business. It is important to point out that regardless of the social system, whether fascist, socialist, capitalist or communist, the underlying mechanism is still money, labor and competition. Communist China is no less capitalistic than the United States. The only difference is the degree by which the state intervenes in enterprise. The reality is that monetary-ism, so to speak, is the true mechanism, that guides the interests of all the countries on the planet. The most agressive and hence dominant variation of this monetary-ism is the free enterprise system. The fundamental perspective as put forth by early free market economists, like Adam Smith, is that self-interest and competition leads to social prosperity, as the act of competition creates incentive, which motivates people to persevere. However, what isn't talked about, is how a competition-based economy invariably leads to strategic corruption, power, and wealth consolidation, social stratification, technological paralysis, labor abuse and ultimately a covert form of government dictatorship by the rich elite. The word corruption is often defined as moral perversion. If a company dumps toxic waste into the ocean to save money, most people recognize this as corrupt behavior. On a more subtle level, when Walmart moves into a small town and forces small businesses to shut down, for they are unable to compete, a grey area emerges. For what exactly is Walmart doing wrong? Why should they care about the Mom and Pop organizations they destroy? Yet even more subtly, when a person gets fired from their job, because a new machine has been created, which can do the work for less money, people tend to just accept that as the way it is, not seen the inherent corrupt inhumanity of such an action. Because the fact is, whether it is dumping toxic waste, having a monopoly enterprise or downsizing the workforce, the motive is the same: Profit. They are all different degrees of the same self-preserving mechanism, which always puts the well-being of people second to monetary gain. Therefore, corruption is not some byproduct of monetary-ism. It is the very foundation. And while most people acknowledge this tendency on one level or another, majority remains naive as to the broad ramifications of having such a selfish mechanism as the guiding mentality in society. Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the US, and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia and Latin America. The US government allowed it to happen. The FDA allowed this to happen and now the government is completely looking the other way. Thousands of innocent hemophiliacs have died from the AIDS virus. This company knew absolutely that it was infected with AIDS. They dumped it because they wanted to turn this disaster into a profit. So you see, you have built-in corruption. We're all chiseling off each other, and you can't expect decency in that sort of thing. A feeling that they don't know who to elect. They think in terms of a democracy, which is not possible in a monetary-based economy. If you have more money to advertise your position, the position you desire in government, that isn't a democracy. It serves those in positions of differential advantage. So it's always a dictatorship of the elitist, the financially wealthy. It is an interesting observation to note how seemingly unknown personalities, magically appear on the scene as presidential candidates. Then before you know it, somehow you are left to choose from a small group of extremely wealthy people who suspiciously have the same broad social view. Obviously, it's a joke. The people placed on the ballot are done so because they have been pre-decided to be acceptable by the established financial powers, who actually run the show. Yet many who understand this illusion of democracy, often think, "If only we could just get our honest, ethical politicians in power, then we would be okay." Well, while this idea of course seems reasonable in our established, oriented world view, it is unfortunately another fallacy. For when it really comes down to what is actually important, the institution of politics and thus politicians themselves, have absolutely no true relevance as to what makes our world and society function. It's not politicians that can solve problems. They have no technical capabilities. They don't know how to solve problems. Even if they were sincere, they don't know how to solve problems. It's the technicians that produce the desalinization plants. It's the technicians that give you electricity. That give you motor vehicles. That heat your house and cool it in the summer time. It's technology that solves problems, not politics. Politics cannot solve problems 'cause they are not trained to do so. Very few people today stop and consider what it is that actually improves their lives. Is it money? Obviously not. One cannot eat money or stuff money into their car to get it to run. Is it politics? All politicians can do is create laws, establish budgets and declare war. Is it religion? Of course not, religion creates nothing except intangible emotional solace for those who require it. The true gift that we as human beings have, which has been solely responsible for everything that has improved our lives, is technology. What is technology? Technology is a pencil, which allows one to solidify ideas on paper for communication. Technology is an automobile, which allows one to travel faster than feet would allow. Technology is a pair of eye glasses, which enables sight for those who need it. Applied technology itself, is merely and extension of human attributes, which reduces human effort, freeing humans from a particular chore or problem. Imagine what your life would be like today without a telephone, or an oven, or a computer, or an airplane. Everything in your home, which you take for granted, from a doorbell, to a table, to a dishwasher, is technology, generated from the creative scientific ingenuity of human technicians. Not money, politics or religion. These are false institutions. ...and writing your congressman is fantastic. They tell you to write to your congressman if you want something done. The men in Washington should be at the forefront of technology. The forefront of human study. The forefront of crime. All the factors that shape human behavior. You don't have to write your congressman. What kind of people are they that are appointed to do that job? The future will have great difficulty... And the question that's raised by politicians is: How much will a project cost? The question is not how much will it cost. Do we have the resources? And we have the resources today to house everyone, build hospitals all over the world, build schools all over the world, the finest equipment in labs for teaching and doing medical research. So you see, we have all that, but we're in a monetary system, and in a monetary system, there's profit. And what is the fundamental mechanism that drives the profit system besides self-interest? What is it exactly that maintains that competitive edge at it's core? Is it high efficiency and sustainability? No. That isn't part of their design. Nothing produced in our profit-based society is even remotely sustainable or efficient. If it was, there wouldn't be a multi-million dollar a year service industry for automobiles. Nor would the average lifespan for most electronics be less than three months before they're obsolete. Is it abundance? Absolutely not. Abundance, as based on the laws of supply and demand, is actually a negative thing. If a diamond company finds ten times the usual amount of diamonds during their mining, it means the supply of diamonds has increased, which means the cost and profit per diamond drops. The fact is: efficiency, sustainability and abundance are enemies of profit. To put it into a word, it is the mechanism of scarcity that increases profits. What is scarcity? Based on keeping products valuable. Slowing up production on oil raises the price. Maintaining scarcity of diamonds keeps the price high. They burn diamonds at the Kimberly Diamond Mine. They're made of carbon. That keeps the price up. So then, what does it mean for society when scarcity, either produced naturally or through manipulation is a beneficial condition for industry? It means that sustainability and abundance will never ever occur in a profit system. For it simply goes against the very nature of the structure. Therefore, it is impossible to have a world without war or poverty. It is impossible to continually advance technology to its most efficient and productive states. And most dramatically, it is impossible to expect human beings to behave in truly ethical or decent ways. People use the word 'instinct' because they can't account for the behavior. They sit back and they evaluate with their lack of knowledge, you know, and they say things like, "Humans are built a certain way, greed is a natural thing," as though they'd worked for years on it. And it's no more natural than wearing clothing. What we want to do is to eliminate the causes of the problems. Eliminate the processes that produce greed, and bigotry, and prejudice, and people taking advantage of one another, and elitism. Eliminating the need for prisons and welfare. We have always had these problems because we have always lived within scarcity, and barter, and monetary systems that produce scarcity. If you eradicate the conditions that generate what you call 'socially offensive behavior,' it does not exist. A guy says: Well listen, are they in-born? No, it's not. There is no human nature, there's human behavior, and that's always been changed throughout history. You're not born with bigotry, and greed, and corruption, and hatred. You pick that up within the society. War, poverty, corruption, hunger, misery, human suffering will not change in a monetary system. That is, there will be very little significant change. It's going to take the redesigning of our culture, our values, and it has to be related to the carrying capacity of the earth, not some human opinion, or some politicians notions of the way the world ought to be. Or some religion's notions of the conduct of human affairs. And that's what The Venus Project is about. The society, that we're about to talk about, is a society that is free of all the old superstitions, incarceration, prisons, police, cruelty and law. All laws will disappear and the professions will disappear, that are no longer valid, such as stockbrokers, bankers, advertising... Gone! Forever! Because it's no longer relevant. When we understand that it is technology devised by human ingenuity which frees humanity and increases our quality of life we then realize, that the most important focus we can have is on the intelligent management of the earth's resources. For it is from these natural resources, we gain the materials to continue our path of prosperity. Understanding this, we then see, that money fundamentally exists as a barrier to these resources, for virtually, everything has a financial cause. And why do we need money to obtain these resources? Because of real or assumed scarcity. We don't usually pay for air and tap water, because it is in such high abundance, selling it would be pointless. So then, logically speaking, if resources and technologies, applicable to creating everything in our societies such as houses, cities and transportation, were in high enough abundance, there would be no reason to sell anything. Likewise, if automation and machinery was so technologically advanced, as to relieve human beings of labor there would be no reason to have a job. And with these social aspects taking care of, there would be no reason to have money at all. So the ultimate question remains: Do we on earth have enough resources and technological understanding to create a society of such abundance, that everything we have now could be available without a price tag and without the need for submission through employment? Yes, we do. We have the resources and technology to enable this at a minimum along with the ability to raise the standards of living so high that people in the future will look back at our civilisation now and gawk at how primitive and immature our society was. What The Venus Project proposes is an entirely different system that's updated to present day knowledge. We've never given scientists the problem of How do you design a society which would eliminate boring and monotonous jobs, that would eliminate accidents in transportation, that would enable people to have a high standard of living, that would eliminate poisons in our food, give us other sources of energy, that are clean and efficient. We can do that out there. The major difference between a resource-based economy and a monetary system, is that a resource-based economy is really concerned with people and their well-being where the monetary system has become so distorted that the concerns of the people are really secondary, if they're there at all. Products that are turned out are for how much money you can get. If there is a problem in society and you can't earn money from solving that problem, then it won't be done. The resource-based economy is really not close to anything that's been tried. And with all our technology today, we can create abundance. It could be used to improve everyone's lifestyle. Abundance all over the world, if we use our technology wisely and maintain the environment. It's a very different system and it's very hard to talk about because the public is not that well enough informed as to the state of technology. At present, we don't have to burn fossil fuels. We don't have to use anything that would contaminate the environment. There are many sources of energy available. Alternative energy solutions pushed by the establishment, such as hydrogen, biomass and even nuclear are highly insufficient, dangerous, and exist only to perpetuate the profit structure the industry has created. When we look beyond the propaganda and self-serving solutions put forth by the energy companies, we find a seemingly endless stream of clean, abundant and renewable energy for generating power. Solar and wind energy are well known to the public. But the true potential of these mediums remains unexpressed. Solar energy, derived from the sun, has such abundance, that one hour of light at high noon contains more energy than what the entire world consumes in a year. If we could capture one-hundreth of a percent of this energy, the world would never have to use oil, gas or anything else. The questioning is not availability, but the technology to harness it. And there are many advanced mediums today which could accomplish just that, if they were not hindered by the need to compete for market share with the established energy power structures. Then there's wind energy. Wind energy has long been denounced as weak and, due to being location driven, impractical. This is simply not true. The US Department of Energy admitted in 2007 that if wind was fully harvested in just three of America's 50 states, it could power the entire nation. And then there are the rather unknown mediums of tidal and wave power. Tidal power is derived from tidal shifts in the ocean. Installing turbines which capture this movement, generates energy. In the United Kingdom, 42 sites are currently noted as available, forecasting that 34% of all the UK's energy could come from tidal power alone. Wave power, which extracts energy from the surface motions of the ocean, is estimated to have a global potential of up to 80,000 terawatt-hours a year. This means 50% of the entire planet's energy usage could be produced from this medium alone. Now, it is important to point out that tidal, wave, solar and wind power requires virtually no preliminary energy to harness, unlike coal, oil, gas, biomass, hydrogen and all the others. In combination, these four mediums alone, if efficiently harnessed through technology, could power the world forever. That being said, there happens to be another form of clean renewable energy, which trumps them all. Geothermal power. Geothermal energy utilizes what is called heat mining, which, through a simple process using water, is able to generate massive amounts of clean energy. In 2006, an MIT report on geothermal energy found that 13,000 zetajules of power are currently available in the earth with the possibility of 2,000 zetajules being easily tapable with improved technology. The total energy consumption of all the countries on the planet is about half of a zetajule a year. This means about 4000 years of planetary power could be harnessed in this medium alone. And when we understand that the earth's heat generation is constantly renewed, this energy is really limitless. It could be used forever. These energy sources are only a few of the clean renewable mediums available and as time goes on, we will find more. The grand realization is that we have total energy abundance without the need for pollution, traditional conservation, or in fact, a price tag. And what about transportation? The prevailing means of transportation in our societies is by automobile and aircraft, both of which predominantly need fossil fuels to run. In the case of the automobile, the battery technology needed to power an electric car that can go over a hundred miles an hour, for over two hundred miles on one charge, exists and has existed for many years. However, due to battery patents, controlled by the oil industry, which limits their ability to maintain market share, coupled with political pressure from the energy industry, the accessibility and affordability of this technology is limited. There is absolutely no reason, other than pure, corrupt profit interests, that every single vehicle in the world cannot be electric and utterly clean, with zero need for gasoline. As far as airplanes, it is time we realize that this means of travel is inefficient, cumbersome, slow and causes far too much pollution. This is a MagLev train. It uses magnets for propulsion. It is fully suspended by a magnetic field and requires less then two percent of the energy used for plane travel. The train has no wheels, so nothing can wear out. The current maximum speed of versions of this technology, of this technology, as used in Japan, is three hundred and sixty one miles per hour. However, this version of the technology is very dated. An organisation called ET-3 which has connections with The Venus Project, has established a tube-based MagLev that can travel up to 4000 miles per hour in a motionless, frictionless tube, which can go over land or under water. Imagine going from L.A to New York for an extended lunchbreak or from Washington D.C. to Beijing, China, in two hours. This is the future of continental and intercontinental travel. Fast, clean, with only a fraction of the energy usage we use today for the same means. In fact, between MagLev technology, advanced battery storage and geothermal energy, there will be no reason to ever burn fossil fuels again. And we can do this now, if we were not held back by the paralyzing profit structure. Now America is inclined toward fascism. It has a propensity by its dominant philosophy and religion to uphold to fascist point of view. American industry is essencially a fascist institution. If you don't understand that, the minute you punch that time clock, you walk into a dictatorship. We're given notions about the respectibility of work. And I realy look at it as being paid slavery. You brought up to believe that you shall earn your living by the sweat of your brow. That holds people back. Freeing people from drudgery, repetitive jobs which make them ignorant. You rob them. In our society, that is a resourced-based economy, machines free people. You see, we can't imagine that because we've never known that kind of world. If we look back at history, we see a very clear pattern of machine automation, slowly replacing human labour. From the disappearance of the elevator man to the near full automation of an automobile production plant, the fact is, as technology grows the need for humans in the work force will continually be diminished. This creates a serious clash, which proves the falsness of the monetary-based labor system, for human employment is in direct competition with technological developement. Therefore, given the fundamental priority of profit by industry, people through time will be continually layed off and replaced by machine. When industry takes on a machine instead of shortening the work day, they downsize. You loose your job so you have a right to fear machines. In a high technology, resourced-based economy, It is conservative to say that about 90% of all current occupations could be phased out by machines, freeing humans to live their life without servitude. For this is the point of technology itself. And through time, with nanotechnology and other highly advanced forms of science, it is not farfetched to see how even complex medical procedures could be performed by machines, as well. And based on the pattern with much higher success rates than humans get today. The path is clear, but our monetary-based structure which requires labour for income, blocks this progress, for humans need jobs, in order to survive. The bottom line is that this system must go or we will never be free and technology will be constantly paralyzed. We have machines that clean out sewers and frees a human being from doing that. So look at machines as extensions of human performance. Furthermore, many occupations today will have simply no basis to exist in a resourced-based economy. Such as anything assosiated with the management of money, advertising, along with a legal system itself. For, without money, a great majority of the crimes that are commited today, would never occur. Virtually, all forms of crime are consequence in the monetary system, either directly or by nevroses inflicted through financial deprevation. Therefore, laws themselves could eventually become extinct. Instead of putting up a sign: 'Drive carefully', 'Slippery when wet', put abrasive on the highway, so it is not slippery when wet. And when a person gets in a car that drunk and a car oscillates at great deal, there's a little pendulum that swings up and back and that will pull the car over the side... Not a law. A solution. Put sonar and radar on automobiles so they can't hit one another. Man-made laws are attempts to deal with occuring problems and not knowing how to solve them... They make a law. In the United States, the most privatised, capitalist country on the planet, it shall come as no surprise that it also has the largest prison population in the world. Growing every year. Statistically, most of these people are uneducated and come from poor, deprived societies. And contrary to propaganda, it is this enviromental conditioning, which lures them into criminal and violent behavior. However, society looks the other way in regard to this point. The legal and prison systems are just more examples of how our society avoids examining the root causes of behavior. Billions are spent each year on prisons and police, while only a fraction is spent on programs for poverty, which is one of the most fundamental variables responsible for crime to begin with. And, as long as we have an economic system, which preferes and in fact, creates scarcity and deprivation, crime will never go away. If people have access to the necessities of life without survitude, debt, barter, trade, they'd behave very differently. You want all these things available without a price tag. Now then, you're not gonna have a price tag, what will motivate people? A man gets everything he wants, he's just laying around in the sun. This is the myth they perpetuate. People in our culture are trained to believe that the monetary system produces incentive. If they have access to things, why should they want to do anything? They would loose their incentive. That's what you're taught to support the monetary system. When you take money out of the scenario, there would be different incentives, very different incentives. When people have access to the necessities of life, their incentives change. What about the moon and the stars? New incentives arise. If you make a painting that you enjoy, you will enjoy giving it to other people, not selling it. I think most of the education, that I've seen today is essentially, producing a person for a job. It's very specialized. They're not generalists. People don't know a lot about a lot of different subjects. I don't think you can get people to go to war, if they knew a lot about a lot of things. I think education is mostly rote and they're not taught how to solve problems. They're not given the tools, emotionally, or within their own field, of how to do critical thinking. In a resource-based economy, the education would be very different. Our society's major concern is mental development and to motivate each person to their highest potential. Because our philosophy is the smarter people are, the richer the world, because everybody becomes a contributor. The smarter your kids are, the better my life will be. Because they'll be contributing more constructively to the environment and to my life. Because everything that we devise within a resource-based economy, would be applied to society. There would be nothing to hold it back. Patriotism, weapons, armies, navies... All that is a sign that we're not civilized yet. Kids will ask their parents: "Didn't you see the necessity of the machines?" "Dad, couldn't you see that war was inevitable when you produce scarcity?" "Isn't it obvious?" Of course, the kid will understand that you're pinheads; raised merely to serve the established institutons. We're such in an abominable, sick society, that we won't make the history book. They'll just say that large nations took land from smaller nations, used force and violence. You'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the beginning of the civilized world. That's when all the nations work together. World unification, working toward common good for all human beings and without anyone being subservient to anyone else. Without social stratification, whether it be technical elitism or any other kind of elitism, eradicated from the face of the earth. The state does nothing because there is no state. The system I advocate, a resource-based global economy, is not perfect. It's just a lot better than what we have. We can never achieve perfection. The social values of our society, which has manifested in perpetual warfare, corruption, oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions, environmental destruction, and a despotic, socially indifferent, profit-oriented ruling class, is fundamentally the result of a collective ignorance of two of the most basic insights humans can have about reality. The emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law. The emergent nature of reality is that all systems; whether it is knowledge, society, technology, philosophy, or any other creation; will, when uninhibited, undergo fluid, perpetual change. What we consider commonplace today such as modern communication and transportation, would have been unimaginable in ancient times. Likewise, the future will contain technologies, realizations and social structures that we cannot even fathom in the present. We have gone from alchemy to chemistry, from a geocentric universe to a heliocentric, from believing that demons were the cause of illness to modern medicine. This development shows no sign of ending, and it is this awareness that aligns us and leads us on a continuous path to growth and progress. Static, empirical knowledge does not exist. Rather, it is the insight of the emergence of all systems we must recognize. This means we must be open to new information at all times, Even if it threatens our current belief system, and hence, identities. Sadly, society today has failed to recognize this, and the established institutions continue to paralyze growth by preserving outdated, social structures. Simultaneously, the population suffers from a fear of change. For their conditioning assumes a static identity and challenging one's belief system, usually results in insult and apprehension. For being wrong is erroneously associated with failure. When in fact to be proven wrong should be celebrated. For it is elevating someone to a new level of understanding, furthering awareness. The fact is, there is no such thing as a smart human being, for it is merely a matter of time before their ideas are updated, changed or irradicated. And this tendency to blindly hold on to a belief system, sheltering it from new, possibly transforming information is nothing less than a form of intellectual materialism. The monetary system perpetuates this materialism, not only by it's self-preserving structures, but also throught the countless number of people who have been conditioned into blindly, and thoughtlessly, upholding these structures, therefore becoming, self-appointed guardians of the status quo. Sheep which no longer need a sheepdog to control them. For they control each other, by ostracizing those who step out of the norm. This tendency to resist change and uphold existing institutions for the sake of identity, comfort, power and profit, is completely unsustainable. And will only produce further imbalance, fragmentation, distortion, and invariably, destruction. It's time to change. From hunters and gatherers, to the agricultural revolution, to the industrial revolution, the pattern is clear. It is time for a new social system which reflects the understandings we have today. The monetary system is a product of a period of time, where scarcity was a reality. Now, with the age of technology, it is no longer relevant to society. Gone with the aberrant behavior it manifests. Likewise, dominant world views, such as theistic religion, operate with the same social irrelevancy. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and all of the others, exist as barriers to personal and social growth. For each group perpetuates a closed world view. And this finite understanding that they acknowledge is simply not possible in an emergent universe. Yet, religion has succeeded in shutting down the awareness of this emergence by instilling the psychological distortion of faith upon it's followers. Where logic and new information is rejected in favor of traditionalized, outdated beliefs. The concept of God, is really a method of accounting for the nature of things. In the early days, people didn't know enough about how things formed, how nature worked. So they invented their own little stories, and they made God in their own image. A guy that gets angry when people don't behave right. He creates floods and earthquakes and they say it's an act of God. A cursory glance at the suppressed history of religion reveals that even the foundational myths themselves are emergent culminations developed through influence over time. For example, a cardinal doctrine of the Christian faith is the death and resurrection of Christ. This notion is so important that the Bible itself states "And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain." Yet it is very difficult to take this account literally. For not only is there no primary source denoting this supernatural event in secular history, awareness of the enormous number of pre-Christian saviors who also died and were resurrected immediately puts this story in mythological territory by association. Early church figures, such as Tortullian, went to great lengths to break these associations, even claiming that the Devil caused the similarities to occur. Stating in the second century: "The devil, whose business is to pervert the truth, mimics the exact circumstance of the Divine Sacraments. He baptizes his believers and promises forgiveness of sins... He celebrates the oblation of bread, and brings in the symbol of the resurrection. Let us therefore acknowledge the craftiness of the Devil, who copied certain things of those that be Divine." What is truly sad, however, is that when we cease the idea that the stories from Christianity, Judaism, Islam and all the others are literal history, and accept them for what they really are, which are purely allegorical expressions, derived from many faiths, we see that all religions share a common thread. And it is this unifying imperative that needs to be recognized and appreciated. Religious belief has caused more fragmentation and conflict than any other ideology. Christianity alone has 34,000 different subgroups. The Bible is subject to interpretation. When you read it, you say, "I think Jesus meant this. I think Job meant that." "Oh no! He meant this." So you have the Lutheran, the Seventh-Day Adventist, the Catholic, and a church divided is no church at all. And this point on division, which is a trademark of all theistic religions, brings us to our second failure of awareness. The false assumption of separation through the rejection of the symbiotic relationship of life. Apart from the understanding that all natural systems are emergent, where all notions of reality will be constantly developed, altered and even eradicated, we must also understand that all systems are, in fact, invented fragments, merely for the sake of conversation. For there is no such thing as independence in nature. The whole of nature is a unified system of interdependent variables, each a cause and a reaction, existing only as a concentrated whole. You don't see the plug to connect to the environment, so it looks like we're free, wandering around. Take the oxygen away, we all die immediately. Take plant life away, we die. And without the sun, all the plants die. So we are connected. We really must take into account the totality. This isn't just a human experience on this planet, this is a total experience. And we know we can't survive without plants and animals. We know we can't survive without the four elements, you know? And so, when are we gonna really start taking that into account? That's what it is to be successful. Success depends on how well we're related to everything around us. I'm very aware of the fact that my grandson cannot possibly hope to inherit a sustainable, peaceful, stable, socially just world unless every child today growing up in Ethiopia, in Indonesia, in Bolivia, in Palestine, in Israel, also has that same expectation. You gotta take care of the whole community or you're gonna have serious problems. And now we have to see that the whole world is the community. And we must all take care of each other that way. And it's not just a community of human beings, it's a community of plants and animals and elements. And we really need to understand that. That's what's gonna bring us joy too, and pleasure. That's what's missing in our lives right now. We can call it spirituality, but the fact of the matter is... Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. That's our godspirit. That's that side of ourselves that really feels it, and you can feel it deep inside you. It's this amazing, wonderful feeling and you know it when you get it. You don't get it from money, you get it from connection. Now if that isn't a hazard to this country. How are we gonna keep building nuclear weapons, you know what I mean? What's gonna happen to the arms industry when we realize we're all one? It's gonna fuck up the economy. The economy that's fake anyway. Which would be a real bummer. You can see why the government's crackin' down... on the idea of experiencing unconditional love. Once we understand that the integrity of our personal existences are completely dependent on the integrity of everything else in our world, we have truly understood the meaning of unconditional love. For love is extensionality, and seeing everything as you and you as everything can have no conditionalities, for in fact, we are all everything, at once. If it's true that we're all from the center of a star, every atom on each of us from the center of a star, then we're all the same thing. Even a Coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street in Buffalo is made out of atoms that came from a star. They've all been recycled thousands of times, as have you and I. And therefore, it's only me out there. So what is there to be afraid of? What is there that needs solace seeking? Nothing. There's nothing to be afraid of because it's all us. The trouble is we have been separated by being born and given a name and an identity and being individuated. We've been separated from the oneness, and that's what religion exploits. That people have this yearning to be part of the overall one again. So they exploit that. They call it God, they say he has rules, and I think it's cruel. I think you can do it absent religion. It's time to claim the unity. Our outmoded social systems have broken apart, and work together to create a sustainable, global society, where everyone is taken care of and everyone is truly free. Your personal beliefs, whatever they may be, are meaningless when it comes to the necessities of life. Every human being is born naked, needing warmth, food, water, shelter. Everything else is auxiliary. Therefore, the most important issue at hand is the intelligent management of the Earth's resources. This can never be accomplished in a monetary system, for the pursuit of profit is the pursuit of self-interest and therefore, imbalance is inherent. Simultaneously, politicians are useless. For our true problems in life are technical, not political. Furthermore, ideologies that separate humanity, such as religion, need strong reflection in the community in regard to it's value, purpose and social relevancy. Hopefully, through time, religion will loose it's materialism and basis in superstition and move into the useful field of philosophy. The fact is, society today is backwards, with politicians constantly talking about protection and security rather than creation, unity and progress. The US alone now spends about $500 billions dollars annually on defense. That is enough to send every high school senior in America to a four year college. In the 1940's, the Manhattan Project produced the first true weapon of mass destruction. This program employed 130,000 people, at an extreme financial cost. Imagine what our life would be like today, if that group of scientists, instead of working on a way of killing people, worked on a way to create a self-sustaining, abundant world. Life today would be very, very different, if that was their goal. Instead of weapons of mass destruction, it is time to unleash something much more powerful. Weapons of Mass Creation. Our true divinity is in our ability to create. And armed with the understanding of the symbiotic connections of life, while being guided by the emergent nature of reality, there is nothing we cannot do or accomplish. Of course, we face strong barriers, in the form of established power structures, that refuse to change. At the heart of these structures is the monetary system. As explained earlier, the fractional reserve policy is a form of slavery through debt, where it is literally impossible for society to be free. In turn, free market capitalism, in the form of free trade, uses debt to imprison the world and manipulate countries into subservience to a handful of large business and political powers. Apart from these obvious amoralities, the system itself is based on competition, which immediately destroys the possibility of large scale collaborations for the common good. Hence paralyzing any attempt at true global sustainability. These financial and corporate structures are now obsolete, and they must be outgrown. Of course, we cannot be naive enough to think that the business and financial elite are going to subscribe to this idea, for they will lose power and control. Therefore, peacefully, a highly strategic action must be taken. The most powerful course of action is simple. We have to alter our behavior to force the power structure to the will of the people. We must stop supporting the system. The only way the establishment will change is by our refusal to participate while continuously acknowledging its endless flaws and corruptions. They're not gonna give up the monetary system, because of our designs of what we've recommend. The system has to fail, and people have to lose confidence in their elected leaders. That will be a major turning point if The Venus Project is offered as a possible alternative. If not, I fear the consequences. The trends now indicate that our country is going bankrupt. The probability is our country will move toward a military dictatorship to prevent riots and complete social breakdown. Once the US breaks down, all the other cultures will undergo similar things. As of now, the world financial system is on the brink of collapse due to it's own shortcomings. The Controller of Currencies stated in 2003 that the interest on the US National Debt will not be affordable in less than ten years. This theoretically means total bankruptcy for the US economy and it's implications for the world are immense. In turn, the fractional reserve-based monetary system is reaching it's theoretical limits of expansion and the banking failures you are seeing are just the beginning. This is why inflation is skyrocketing, our debt is at record levels and the government and FED are hemorrhaging new money to bailout the corrupt system. For the only way to keep the banks going is by making more money. The only way to make more money is to create more debt and inflation. It is simply a matter of time before the tables turn and there's no one willing to take new loans while defaults grow as people are unable to afford their current loans. Then the expansion of money will stop and contraction will begin on a scale never before seen, ending a century long pyramid scheme. This has already begun. Therefore, we need to expose this financial failure for what it is, using this weakness to our advantage. Here are some suggestions: Expose the banking fraud. Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are the most powerful controllers within the corrupt Federal Reserve system. It's time to boycott these institutions. If you have a bank account or credit card with any of them, move your money to another bank. If you have a mortgage, refinance with another bank. If you own their stock, sell it. If you work for them, quit. This gesture will express contempt for the true powers behind the private banking cartel, known as the Federal Reserve. And create awareness about the fraud of the banking system itself. Two: Turn off the TV news. Visit the emerging, independent news agencies on the Internet for your information. CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX and all the others present all news pre-filtered to maintain the status quo. With four corporations owning all major media outlets, objective information is impossible. This is the true beauty of the Internet. And the establishment has been losing control because of this free flow of information. We must protect the Internet, at all times, as it is truly our savior right now. Three: Don't ever allow yourself, your family or anyone you know, to ever join the military. This is an obsolete institution now used exclusively for maintaining an establishment that is no longer relevant. US soldiers in Iraq work for US corporations, not the people. Propaganda forces us to believe that war is natural and the military is an honorable institution. Well if war is natural, why are there 18 suicides every single day by American veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder? If our military men and women are so honored, why is it that 25% of the American homeless population are veterans? Four: Stop supporting the energy companies. If you live in a detached house, get off the grid. Investigate every means of making your home self-sustainable with clean energy. Solar, wind and other renewable energies are now affordable consumer realities, and considering the never-ending rising costs of traditional energies, it will likely be a cheaper investment over time. If you drive, get the smallest car you can and consider using one of the many conversion technologies that can enable your car to be a hybrid, electric or run on anything other than establishment fuels. Five: Reject the political system. The illusion of democracy is an insult to our intelligence. In a monetary system, there is no such thing as a true democracy, and there never was. We have two political parties owned by the same set of corporate lobbyists. They are placed in their positions by the corporations, with popularity artificially projected by their media. In a system of inherent corruption, the change of personnel every couple of years has very little relevance. Instead of pretending that the political game has any true meaning, focus your energy on how to transcend this failed system. And six: Join the movement. and help us create the largest mass movement for social change the world has ever seen. We must mobilize and educate everyone about the inherent corruption of our current world system, along with the only true sustainable solution, declaring all the natural resources on the planet as common heritage to all people, while informing everyone as to the true state of technology and how we can all be free if the world works together, rather than fights. The choice lies with you. You can continue to be a slave to the financial system and watch the continuous wars, depressions and injustice across the globe while placating yourself with vain entertainment and materialistic garbage. Or, you can focus your energy on true, meaningful, lasting, holistic change which actually has the realistic ability to support and free all humans with no one left behind. But in the end, the most relevant change must occur first inside of you. The real revolution is the revolution of consciousness, and each one of us first needs to eliminate the divisionary, materialistic noise we have been conditioned to think is true; while discovering, amplifying and aligning with the signal coming from our true empirical oneness. It is up to you. What we are trying in all these discussions and talks here, is to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformism of the mind. Not accept things as they are... but to understand it, to go into it, to examine it, give your heart and your mind with every thing that you have to find out. A way of living differently. But, that depends on you and not somebody else. Because in this, there is no teacher, no pupil. There's no leader, there's no guru, there's no master, no savior. You yourself are the teacher and the pupil, you're the master, you're the guru, you are the leader... You are everything! And, to understand... is to transform what is.
