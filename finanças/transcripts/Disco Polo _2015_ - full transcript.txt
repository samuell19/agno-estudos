In the early 1990s, when Poland regained its freedom and the whole country was dreaming its “Great Polish American Dream”, is when Disco Polo outburst. Suddenly everything was possible. Do you know him? Mornin' Desert Devils. Desert is a hostile place for man. But“. the one I'm looking for is not an ordinary man. Red? What do you want, man? Four months, three weeks and two days. What? That was when my life got a whole new meaning. And all because of you. Yes. I am a waiter. Or maybe I was? For some it's just a job, for others - heaven on earth. A side job here and there, tips and inﬂuential connections. Today you serve others, tomorrow they serve you. That's capitalism. The owner. Loves Egypt. Absurd, I know. But ifs classy, isn't it? Did you know those Sphinxes outside the hotel were bought from Tutankhamen himself'? Shit! The moustache saw me! What the fuck are you doing? Do you think people will wait on you? Grab that tray and off to the ballroom! Did you see Maciek from Atomic? He's here? Yes! - Jesus, I need the bathroom! - Me, too! Maciek from Atomic. The biggest Disco Polo star. Wherever Maciek goes, opportunities follow. Four Eighteens only in my car That's whafs trendy and hot Four Eighteens only in my ride, They like to be underneath when I'm on top lam so sorry! I didn't mean to... Why am I always so unlucky? I am so sorry. But I am your biggest idol. Well, that's different. I'm Anka. Gensonina, actually. I always dreamed to meet you. But if everyone walked like you we wouldn't get anywhere, would we? Go, you're needed on stage. Come on Red! What's this? Your future. Drink. We haven't had so many millions in here in ages. Not to mention the artists. See that guy in the glasses? A year ago he was growing lettuce. Now he's growing money! That one lost a million in the Marriott last night. Do you get n? Get what? Two words: Disco Polo. All Poles hate each other. Whether it's here or in Greenpoint, our people are fighting like dogs. Take the Jews or the Indians. They cooperate, help each other. And the Poles? Fuck no. Jealousy and hate are in our nature. That, and from time to time some uprisings. Wow! Ladies und gentlemen. Meine Damen and Herren. I'd like to thank you all forjoining us on this special day to celebrate the birthday of our friend, patron and the only true Pole Daniel Polak! No... Daniel! Dear Daniel! My friend! Ladies and Gentlemen, there is no one better to express our gratitude than the most beautiful star of all the Poles. And the most beautiful Pole among the stars. The love of our CEO's life, The one, the crazy - Gensonina! Black eyes, weird eyes, Scary and beautiful eyes! How I love you, how I fear you, It seems I met you in an unlucky hour! Black eyes, weird eyes, Scary and beautiful eyes! How I love you, how I fear you, It seems I met you in an unlucky hour! Why am I here? To watch you watch her'? Right. Come this way. Finally at last. Shaken not stirred and fast. Of course. Your 200... and my ride. Put your song in. It's not like you wrote it. You bought that one, too? Would you write something that sold 1.5 million cassettes? For forty bucks? Introduce us. He played it when I was given the honorary citizenship of dog patch. I got him drunk and bought it. I wanted to score more songs but he disappeared. Maybe he killed himself out of shock. He was a genius. His name was Red. I even have his description. Now you get it? You're wrong. That's not me. Red, I don't want to buy your song. You play, I sing, we start a band... I have to go. But thanks. Nice story. Thanks. But, Red... The End. Read by Mr. Tomasz Knapik Tomek! Dinner! Welcome viewers. As usual we talk about the weather. What can we expect on Thursday? They moved the Wnius to 3:00 pm. It causes cancer. The one from 6:23 pm. If it's even five minutes late it will collide with the Koluszki. Ifs like drinking frying oil. Wnius is a priority. So, I will stop Koluszki. You'd better get tested. Back in '86 when they were taking coal to the shipyard we stopped everything' Even Moscow stood still for an hour. Especially, when you eat such crap. There was a plan. ll needed lo be fulfilled. I wonder what mother would say. And now they want to privatize the railway. Privatize... Welcome, fans of the Banana Disco Show! We start with a new song on the charts “I am the Only One” by Gensonina. This is who I am nothing will change it Won Y change it I play always play and and go all in Till the end... Son... They're going to dismantle the tracks to the church. We could sell the handcar, throw in something extra and get a car to travel in style. OK but a Dodge. Dodge is a great car. You can also vote for Atomic and their song “Hey, Do You Know?” Hey, do you know that I'm in love with you? Hey, what a pity! won'! be seeing you. Oh fuck me. Fucking A Fuck! When you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose. Hello. I'm a friend of Reds. Is he in? Eventually' I told you, Grandma, I'm not here for anyone. Especially for you. Wow! What a beautiful apartment. Ifs obvious someone has taste. You see, Ma'am, how it is? Times are like the weather, changeable and unpredictable. Everything changes. But if someone has talent, like your grandson, they can rule the world. Good diet, proper company and the gates to a career are wide open. Sorry, what's your name? Tom. Pardon me, Thomas, actually. You never told me, dear, that you had such an intelligent friend. I'm not interested in your stories. I have other plans. My grandson is saving up for a business. That's perfect! I'm here to propose a business venture that will allow me to pursue my passion: combining the pleasant with the useful. A hard-working man and a cheeky woman will conquer the world. Your speech isn't convincing. Ifs late. We're having dinner. Music is a great business now. Look... You're the master of the genre, I sing fashionable lyrics. And we both want to get out of this shit hole. Grandma, say grace. We'll do it like this. You play something of yours, I will sing, Grandma will be the judge. If it doesn't work I'll go home and you get back to dinner. Deal? She promised me that my dreams would come true, In my dreams forever would be you. Can somebody guess, what is her name? No one knows her, but me. Of you, my love, am thinking all the time Of you, my love, am thinking all the time Fucking great' That's my address and I'll see you tomorrow. Don't be late. I hate when people are late. That's unbelievable! Unbelievable! Impossible! Such a beauty! Here, in this country! I didn't expect that. Speakers... Careful... Careful. Here. OK. Lights. Anything else? Roland? Checked. Lights? Checked. Everything3 here. Great. We've got to see if it works. It does. It's from Munich why wouldn't it. - Great! - Good? Very good. Pack it! Pack it, pack it. Congrats. Great model - You owe us a thousand. - Why'? Customs duty. Gentlemen, the agreement was different. You were supposed to owe me that thousand. The deal's off. - No refunds. - Everything 0k? No, no, no... No problem. The handcar comes with us anyway You decide about the equipment. Got it? A JD 800'? This equipment is specially designed to tum making sounds into sheerjoy? Where did you...? I believe in you so I invest in you. This sequencer is magic. And I don't even know what that is. Chill. You'll learn. Now warm up your fingers Were starting. We have four hours to record everything. I have to put 16 tracks into that thing. Where's the fire? A) we play a concert tomorrow B) my father finishes work at 7 pm. And he really doesn't like music. Of you, my love, am thinking all the time... Of you, my love, am thinking all the time... Of you, my love, am thinking all the time... Of you, my love, am thinking all the time... Adding a second vocal in the chorus and a delay in the bass it'll sound German. But ifs about love. There is a boy, a girl a father who doesn't approve of it. Never mind. Now we have to strike. Strokes are great. I can get one below 200 Hz. The father interferes and that's why the boy is singing. You sing beautifully, I have to admit. And you fucking play beautifully. I have to admit. We can't handle this alone. We need a technician. We'll find one. I have a cousin who is unemployed. She does weddings, worked in video - She knows stuff. - Is she honest? She has a car. And you think you can just waltz in here and play? We have hits. I mean... Future hits. This is not a barn dance. It's business. Show business. Music labels, discos... A hundred in this part of the country alone. One every fifty kilometers. Centralization, Headquarters rings a bell? But we want to play. Well, that changes everything. But wait. I have a list of bands for the whole year. And you know what? You're not there. And you're not here, either. And what will I tell my father'? That he can ride a synthesizer. - I told you it would end like this. - It hasn't even started! Fuck it! I don't know, man... I lost everything. It used to be that when you wanted to play you went to the firehouse. Now there are headquarters. Its pointless. You can plug in here. Light switches are over there Some cables are in the storeroom. It should be enough. So which one of you is getting married? My friend. Congratulations. Because we don't want a disco here. No. No disco. Awedding is a different story. I've always said that Red was made for the stage. Look at how he's built. Such a perfect figure must be emphasized. Here, take a belt. Gentlemen, you look fucking great. We tried. At least I'll get home in time for “Miami Woe”. Maybe you didn't put up enough posters? No, they're everywhere. All right, Mixer. Unplug it. So where are they? Al the disco. Where else? Listen... Wait a bit longer. Red! Don't unplug the cables! Maya the bee ﬂies around, Oh, oh, oh, collects nectar from the ﬂowers And there VWI/y in a tulip waits for breakfast Maya the bee ﬂies around, Oh, oh, oh, collects nectar from ﬂowers People! Atomic is playing at the firehouse! Granny hasn't smoked in a year. Right... She hasn't... She wont unless she gets a cigarette. And she doesn't get them from me. Is she in prison or something? Better in prison than the grave. Play! I adore her. She's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, and hide her in the bottom of my heart. I adore her. She's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, and hide her in the bottom of my heart. Ohhh, ohh, 0h... Motherfuckers! Guys! We're putting this out! I desire her! Her! Her! I adore her, she's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, and hide her in the bottom of my heart. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! The party's over! Get back to the disco! Calm down! I adore her, she's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, Fire!!! I adore her, she's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, and hide her in the bottom of my heart. I adore her, she's here and dances for me, cause she knows for sure that I will take her, Dad! You won't believe it... I got up this morning, walked out of the house and the handcar was gone. I thought, Tommy took it. But the neighbor said Tommy didn't. Because it had been sold. To the Germans. Five years of saving, making sacrifices... And this is how you pay me back? They tricked me. But you bought the piano? We were supposed to buy a Dodge and drive it to church. You could drive girls in it but you chose to play the artist. Play! But not here. Give me a year and I will buy you two Dodges. He stole from his own father. Shame and disgrace. Get out of my sight! The door can be either open or closed. There is no third option. Disco Polo is us. This music is about us. Am an artist who is not afraid to show people who I really am. So if they won't let us through the bottom we will conquer them from the top. Pack your things. We're going. There is nothing for us here. Holy Mother of God, what now? Listen, it's very simple. Without a record label there are no concerts. VWthout concerts there is no cassette and without a cassette we have nothing. To have a label we need a demo. That's the key. Our first step. That's scary. Mixer, you have connections in the video business, right? - Right. - We'll start there. It's all improvised but from now on. We're a band and we have to stick together. All together! Fun is fun but where will Red sleep? Where? In the best motel in the country. Blessed are those who wash BEST MOTEL their clothes in the blood of the lamb. IN THE COUNTRY The Apocalypse is coming! Only the blind don't see. Be afraid of the Lord. Judgment Day is coming! Kneel! Where were you when you weren't here? - Get lost! - Get lost?! Shut up when you talk to me. Fucking amazing place. Good thing that grandma can't see this. Show yourself! Those with ears should listen! You can try this. And I thought you weren't coming back. The boss is in? We have business. He's recording. Don't “borrow” anything like the last time. Awesome movie. Let's go, gentlemen. You want a demo? Oh, yes! Yes! Fuck me Where did you bring us? Hi, Witek. Those cassettes... I will... You've probably worn them out by now, you shameless little piggy. Christy, take five. So, what's up with you? I have two fucking talented musicians here. They will be stars. But we need a demo. So, well... You can take all the credit. You're a fucking talent scout now? Boys, I'm sorry I can't. My equipment can barely keep up with the workload. But what equipment! HIFI, HIQ, multitrack MTB... MT8X Of course! Supersensitive. Full dynamic? - You bet. - Gold tips? Golden... how many eggs did you eat to sound proof it all. A studio worthy of the greatest stars. Well, I did invest a bit. And that's my cousin, our local Jean Michel Jarre. The future of Polish disco. As in Disco Polo. - Disco Polo? - Yes. Why the fuck didn't you say so? Fuck me! Mixer! Stop! What's up? - What if they say it's shit? - Shit? I gave it all I had. Maybe we should tell them that you wrote Alomids hit song? So they immediately throw us out? We're a band now. We act together. That was expensive. I'll buy it back when we're famous. Oh, God. OK. Showtime. (signs: Artists / Guests) It's two days of standing in line. It won't work. Tour 512, follow me! Come on! Quiet! Only two bands will be admitted today and they are both inside. You can all go now. Disperse! Welcome, to the biggest Polish record label “Alpha Music”. Today you'll get an insight into show business and the work of those whose lives you adore. - Got the cassette? - You got it Oh, yes. I do. Over a hundred artists record their cassettes here every year. Gensonina, Atomic, Mario and many, many more. All of them are Mr. Polak's musical children. In our state-of-the-an studio, four singers can record at the same time. Mr. Polak has a supernatural power. If the hair on his arm stands on end while he listens to the music, he knows he is dealing with a future star. Concentrate on priorities. Like I do. Disco Polo is my life. My only love. That's Mario. Impossible. The production never stops. Recruiting the locals decreased the unemployment rate by 23 percent. All thanks to Disco Polo. And this is the newest cassette by the giant group -Atomic. Over 1.5 million copies sold in the first week alone. We have to find Polak. Look! I do the thinking here. Maciek! Long time no see! And your newest hit... Sweet! Daniel, let me introduce... Red. And Tom - from the band. Me and Maciek go way back. He told me once he'd introduce us and... We have a great demo... Bravo. Maciek's friends are my friends. And your place is in the queue outside. That's a shame because Maciek and I have such a history... - Daniel... I think ifs worth trying. - You think? You know what my name is? Polak. And if Polak likes it, every Pole will like it. You have one minute. Night, night, night, sky full of stars Twilight suddenly changes into darkness I know, I know, I know, one of them May make my wish come true No one will ever know, what I really want What I desire down deep in my heart I guess only you can find in my eyes the hidden truth A star shines above My first wish is you A shooting star makes dreams come true I will fucking kill you! Get the fuck out! Get me the fucking sword! No one's visited me in ages. It's all yours? These planets. Of course. You know how hard it is to be a star'? They follow you everywhere, never stop talking, asking, making your life impossible. When I'm fed up with it all I come here, at those planets and dream of being somewhere else. At the end of the world. I wonder where it is. No one knows. Do you? Bet you don't! Who are you anyway? A musician. We came here with our demo but my friend fucked up everything. You are the waiter from the hotel, you sneaked in here and you're up to something. And I can tell Polak all about it. Unless you give me something for my silence. All right... But what? Something... I don't have. OK. I can give you some freedom. I have plenty of it. You think I'm crazy? No, no way. Everyone says that. Crazy. That palace that took Polak two weeks to put up? He would have killed them but they got away Holy shit! Look at that mess. Wasted money. Is anyone working here? An engineer'? Anyone? They're on a lunch break. Listen, two new boys from Polak will come to your studio tonight. They will need a proper welcome. - VWII do. Who are they? - Gender. You don't know them? Never saw, never heard. As always. I was thinking that if we invested in a machine that makes echoes, the quality would be five times better. And where will you play with that echo? Al a firehouse? We were so close and that idiot got us thrown out. Don't call him that. He's allergic. To what? To stress. - We will be on The Banana Show. - What? Tonight. Is that a joke? - The big joke is that we don't have a name. - We don't have a name? No. What will they call us? - You don't have a name'? - So, what's our name'? I know. Laser. Want some gum, Red? - What? - some gum. Get down! Roland welcomes you. Great. We got time? My hair needs a touch up. Milk, cheese, clay, I'm beautiful all day. Chicken all day long and my muscles are strong. Your muscles would put any muscles to shame! - Who's the star'? - Gender. Vihnier in Poland is beautiful. Very beautiful. Nothing falls. No rain, no snow. Winter is not bad. Yesterday I went and bought myself a pair of pink long johns. We went for a sleigh ride. I grilled some sausage“. Great sausage... Roland welcomes you. Weather only weather. When will I read the news? That's the stupidest idea ever. They'll kill us. Shut up and do what you do best. Just be! Come on, come on. Roland welcomes you. Thanks. ...they burned me at the solarium. Camera to the left. And get some light in here, yesterday was a nightmare. Here you are! Where were you? Amateurs! Three minutes for make up! Now! Shoes off, you're going to the beach. Right. Which one is Ziggy? - Him. - So you're Marius. OK. Come here. Switch with me. Listen, boys. First we talk, then you sing. Talk sense because that's going live. Jesus Christ why is ii so grey? Mommy didn't have anything brighter? God, God, God, Goddess, I beg you, add some color to that. And gel. A lot of gel to save the day. And keep smiling. Be happy. It's Televsion! It's a show! Hello, hello, hello! Welcome lo The Banana Disco Show! Today we welcome the first timers, the members of Gender. It's just the beginning of your musical adventure but I've heard that you already have fans. Of course. I mean... We want to thank all our fans for being so many of them. - And that's a nice surprise. Your success took you by surprise? Or maybe somewhere, subconsciously... Well, somewhere, subconsciously... we were expecting that. Let's talk music. I've heard you've been working on new hits. Can you tell us more? Those will be completely new hits. There will be more hits. Even more hits. More hits, more concerts to which you are all invited. And I invite you to hear a new song by Gender... Actually, we're called Laser.

O.K. Lets talk. I haven't been that surprised in a long time and in general I don't like it. You shouldn't play like that, gentlemen, the Polack way... We have to cooperate. And the whole country functions better. - Sugar'? - Vodka. - Well, gentlemen? We're signing? - We're signing. That's a standard agreement. You sign and it becomes lawfully binding. OK. I'll say it once. You impressed me. You start recording in an hour, concerts begin in a week. Each concert should last 90 minutes. You do have that much material? We do. Get ready to be struck by Laser! I want to be your sweet milk chocolate, so that you can taste me all day long. I want to be your lipstick baby, to always kiss your lips.

Russians on the right, Germans on the left, Czechs on the bottom... What the fuck can the Czechs give us? Sit. And Slovakia. Another "big" country. God was exceptionally malicious.

She wanted him to be a great man Let freedom reign, freedom and liberty Bring on the party and a young girl! Let freedom reign, freedom and liberty Bring on the party and a young girl! Let freedom reign, freedom and liberty Bring on the party and a young girl! And now back to work. Congrats on your success, Mr. Tom. You're hereto borrow eggs? No. You don't have proper security. Thank you. I can manage. I'll be frank. You have two options. Concert or complex. In our world disasters don't go hand in hand. We suggest buying both. - Do you know who I fucking just played for'? - We do. And that's why we give you a choice. - You have talent, Mr. Tom. - It would be a shame to lose it. Sorry, but I'm not interested. Not now, not ever. As you wish, sir. Have a good day. Have a good day. Get yourthings. Time for a road trip. Weather won't be good... Got a lighter? See all those people? I always dreamed of finding a way to make them forget who they really are. So they could lose themselves in the world of music ﬂowing from the heart of the Polish soul. That was me once, I was one of them. But I had my dreams, my vision. And I was loyal. Tell me, what would you do with a traitor'? I don't know... I'd try to absolve him? - What? - Well... absolve... Maybe you're right? I wonder if he ever finds out that you just saved him. - Who? - Mario. Mario... He signed with the competition. What a dickhead. Absolve... Wait here. Mario... - Something new? - New, yes. Everything here. All are good but Atomic is the best. - And Laser'? - Not bad but only fourth. - Give me Atomic. - Here. - Original? - Of course. Thanks. I have the new Mario. Tommy, remember where you came from. Always. Red, if you want to be a star you have to act like one. I do. - You can never stop. - I don't. You have to believe in success and do something spectacular. - I do. - What do you mean? A music video like this country has never seen. We do that. Polak won't be too happy. Polak doesn't care at all if we're the best. He doesn't get that there is Laser and nobody else for a long, longtime. Listen, we all pitch in. I'll organize everything and you just come and play. I promise you won't regret it. - Why is this one so sad? - A faulty injection mould. - I told you to change it. - But the whole bunch was already made. - Morning. - Morning, morning. Where can I find a director? - What kind of a director'? - The best kind. The best? That would be the lazy one over there. Thanks. You see, I want to mix contradicting forces. Turn an apparent impossibility into a fact. Of course, emotions must be underlined. Something like moving the world from its foundations and fucking it with everything we got. I truly understand. But what you aim for, please forgive me, doesn't really comply with the countenance represented by your form. - Not that I have something against it, but... - All right. I'll be brief. That's my budget. The light is good... More sand here. Gulls over there. Nice blush. The band to the first position. We're shooting. and please bring me some tea And if Polak got to him? And cut him off at the knees? - Chill. - What if he cuts us off? - You're safe with me. - So where are they? They're here. Tomek, let's not land. Let's ﬂy away. A little bit longer. Why are you doing this? Because for me, life is about moments. Fate brought us love And promised me paradise I was like someone new with hope for a better life Sonnet, sonnet, sonnet of love, praised by the poets forever sonnet of trust and jealousy Ifs been, is and will always be the same Love is you and I And life that is not a game words, so uncertain, so fragile, like crystal glass Sonnet, sonnet, sonnet of love, praised by the poets forever sonnet of trust and jealousy My little panther. - I'm here. - We have been waiting so long for this. OK. Let's go, let's go. Red, let's do it. My little gnome, you. Poles can only blame themselves. They don't believe that they have the power. We all have it. I have it. So do you. And you. Red, quit playing those redneck tunes. - I always played like that. - Exactly! Played! You got terribly fat. - What the fuck? - A parcel. Where do I put it? I waited for the parcel yesterday. Today you can put it up your ass. lam recording here. I only write at dawn. The sun's energy pours onto me. I pour it on paper and onto my fans. Ifs too much for me. I cannot record in such conditions. Think where would you be if I hadn't dragged you out of that dark hole. Anyway, Polak said that this will end in a very dark hole. Very dark. He said that. He is a loser with no taste. Mr Tom, what does you real life look like? That's taste? deer, horses and elephants? You think that's taste, do you? - You suddenly miss him? - Shut up! You want to fuck that loser'? Bravo, Mr. Tom. Bravo, bravo Mr. Tom. I don't recognize you, man. All you care about is money! Art isn't important anymore! Don Perignon. Fuck knows which vintage. It cost as much as a car. People are crazy. Bravo, Tommy. You've surpassed yourself. So tell me, how much money did I make you? Enough for a case of champagne. Look. Dreams come true. Laser and nobody else for a long, a long time. And now I offer you something I offer to very few. Read. “Ole Richard, win! Ole, Richard” for President... Jesus, who wrote that? You want me to rewrite it for you? - I want you to sing it. - Oh, no, Daniel. You know that I only sing my own songs. You'll sing that and we are even. I didn't make you enough money? Remember those two gentlemen who played golf at your place? They billed you and I paid. You don't say. Nobody asked you to. I couldn't let anything bad happen to you. My dear Daniel... Fuck your song. And remember once and for all that no one will ever tell me what to do. Dear Tommy, know my kind heart. You will sing it nicely and I'll let you keep Anka. Good morning, Mr. Tom. The boss isn't here. I know. But he told me to pick up Anka. OK. Get me security. Anka! I have a surprise for you. Come quickly. We'll explain everything when the boss gets here. OK. You know what, Kitty? We'll take your car. - Apologize. - I'm sorry. You're an idiot, you know that? But you sang so well I could feel the sun coming onto you. And I decided to forgive you. I am Laser and no one will tell me what I can or cannot do. As if you were a poet. We'll start our own label. We'll sing duets and promote new talents. We'll create a true independent Disco Polo. Tell me, where are we actually going? Remember telling me you've had enough of Polak? I took care of him. Nothing matters now. We are running away and we are free. Fuck. He'll kill us. Why didn't you ask my opinion? Answer me! Let me out! No, don't let me out. Faster! Step on it! Step on it! - Let me go! Watch it! - Let her go! You have a contract on him? Not today. Remember Johnny? He was a conductor. Well, he retired. And now he is solving crosswords. And once he read a clue: leader of Laser, begins with I was so proud that my son made it to crosswords. Hello? Yes, he is. For you. A friend. - Hello? - You're alive, man? I was just wondering that. Because the TV claims that you're not. A tragedy struck today. A yacht belonging to a beloved and famous artist, the leader of Laser catches fire and drowns. Why? We ask a fireman. So far we weren't able to confirm anything. We didn't find a body and chances of survival in such temperatures are small. Plus the current is so strong that we don't know where to look. What a tragedy. Rogers Cool VWlson. Once there was Pavarotti and now it's them. Tomorrow night. Atomic, Gensonina, Laser - Oh fuck, he replaced us. - Oh, fuck. On the desert at dawn. They will have guards at the from. But here, here and here should be clear. The only condition is that we go in separately. Like in the movies. Red, tell me, how did you convince Rogers to let us in to the TV studio? I showed him your lyrics. You're a genius, too. Hey... I... wanted... You wanted to apologize. Well... Yes... That you were an arrogant prick towards Red. Or that your overgrown ambition almost caused a catastrophe? For everything. I am sorry. People, dear people! The president of Taiwan shaved his face! A Great Disco Polo Gala in Poland! A bearded woman dances on a pole! A big rain won't fall! My darlings! A big thank you to crazy Roman! And now a legend! I was surprised to hear that Laser needs a playback. They always played live! Sore vocal chords. But ifs OK now. All right but I didn't practice with them. Wait, you've got something there. - That's why I'm here. - Right. ...the one, the only... Atomic. You still want freedom? - If he sees you... - ...he'll kill me. I love you. You have to help us. To the stage. This is how you're in my dreams and imagination My most beautiful will I ever meet you or not And remember that from now on your success is my success. - That's an honor, Mr Polak. - Mr Polak, the real bomb. Bravo, bravo. Just don't get lost. I forgot the disc. From near and far, I wait for you so long Where should I look, do you exist at all, who knows Thank you, Gensonina, the fairest of them all. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest star of our music. Today particularly concerned with our country's future. Especially for our candidate, Mr. Richard, the one and only... Laser! Daniel, it's a fantastic show! - Friends! - Fuck! We don't do politics. We do life! I really like spring... - Fuck! - Don't freak out, Daniel! Not now. Not in front of the audience. What do you mean, not in front of the audience?! You powdered solar sequin-shitting bitch! Look at that! Moments, moments as ephemeral as butterﬂies And the clock ticks, you won'! stop it anyway Daniel, don't be nervous. So remember those moments, moments There has been so many The clock won'! hurt us Let time ﬂy, I don'! care Red! Lets get the fuck out of here! Catch those fuckers for fuck's sake! Fucking run after them! Here! In here! - I did it! - You did it?! This way! Come on! - We finally made it! - I always believed in us. Because there is Gender and nobody else for a long, long time. Bravo, Tommy. You could have been a legend but you won't be. No, I already am a legend. Believe it if it makes easier for you to die? Why not kill me? Do it! - Get out of the line of fire. - Don't tell me what to do! Ania! Let's all just die you limp fucks!! What a great idea. I don't see any other choice since each of you fucked up. We will clean this up. You're incapable of taking care of my business. Finish it! You have some old fashioned scruples. No! You shouldn't have played the Polack way. I've said it so many times: Cooperate! And the country functions better! Downstairs everyone! Fuck. What a great idea. I don't see any other choice since each of you fucked up. We will clean this up. Finish it! You've done it now, Daniel. Bravo. What will happen now? Now? Laser and nobody else for a long, longtime.
