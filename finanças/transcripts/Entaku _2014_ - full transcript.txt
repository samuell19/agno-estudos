Okay. don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything. (Conjunctivitis) Conjunctivitis. Teacher Ibiki, what is depth perception? Depth perception refers to the ability to judge the distance of objects. Does having conjunctivitis affect depth perception? No, it's not related to conjunctivitis. Because she's wearing an eye patch and only using one eye to see. That sounds impressive, right? Yes, it's quite impressive. (Eye patch, conjunctivitis, depth perception) Let's all take care of him. Okay. And three laps to go. Okay. Coco, I'm sorry. It seems like I accidentally infected you. It's not your fault. I already had a feeling of eye discomfort before. Eye discomfort? So it's not your fault. Don't worry about it. Let me be alone for a while. You are just pretending to be sick. You're so noisy, you dummy. Cluck, cluck, cluck, the pretending Coco. I'm not pretending to be sick. Little brat, go away. Yanie, don't slack off. Get back in line. Yes. I'm talking to you. Don't just pick the meat. Because meat tastes better, right? You should have a balance of meat and vegetables. It's all because the food is so delicious. Turn it over. (Kanta, 42 years old) Is it delicious? (Shiori, 42 years old) is that so? Chew well, it's good for your teeth. (Isao, 76 years old) This husband is so annoying. Is that so? Am I annoying? Not at all. (Kamiko, 65 years old) (Tomomi, 14 years old) Have some enoki mushrooms. Today's dishes are all soft and don't require much chewing. (Riko, 14 years old) It's delicious. It's really delicious, isn't it? What is this? It's boiled eggs. They're really delicious. (Masako, 14 years old) Delicious. Mom peels the eggshells so well. Really? They're cheap. The egg dropped. Here you go. It drops because of the poor depth perception. What's wrong, Coco? Eyelid inflammation? Eyelid inflammation? Yeah. Conjunctivitis... It's called conjunctivitis, you dummy. Conjunctivitis... Conjunctivitis is also called eyelid inflammation.

By the way, why are you here? (Morishita, 14 years old, Riko's boyfriend) Father-in-law: What's he doing here? Enough with the arguing, you blockhead. Is it really okay to keep your hair like that? Listen... listen to me explain. This is called a hairstyle... He says it's his personal style. Riko, break up with him tomorrow. I can't stand that hair. But his face is not bad. All he has is a handsome face. Yeah, only his face. Speaking of which, his face isn't that great either, right? Right. Eat, eat, there's so much left, finish the vegetables. Um... The knitting, right? Why is this table so round? (Round table) (Kanta calls it "eyelid inflammation.") (Kanta calls it "eyelid inflammation," and pinkeye can also be called "sty.") Kota Kota, Good morning. Morning. Let's go. It's 7:20, we're in trouble. Did you hear the clattering sound last night? I thought it sounded like deer hooves. I felt like a celestial being was coming. Really? I didn't hear anything. Maybe they passed by my house. (JAPONICA exercise book No one is allowed to see it Class 3-2, Kataru Woshiorigin) Mako, you're going to be late. Grandma, it's me, Tomi. It doesn't matter, the faces are all the same anyway. It does matter. We're really going to be late, I'm leaving. Be careful on the way. Stewed potatoes with meat and sausage. Does that go together? Can you keep this a secret? Isn't this Coco's exercise book? How did it end up here with Tomi? I found it when I was looking for a blanket. I brought it because I always wanted to embroider this. Embroider what? This ant? Yes. Didn't we agree to give Grandma a beret? Yeah. A sky-blue beret. If we embroider this on the beret... It will definitely be super cool. Embroider this ant? Yeah. On the side of the hat? Yes. This idea is awesome. Right? Right You have great taste. Yeah, neither of us thought of that. By the way, let's see what's written inside. Sure. (Loneliness) It says loneliness on top. Is that the loneliness they mean? Probably. (Right: Helen Keller, Triple Pain, Blind Eyes, Deaf Ears, and That) Boat Refugee, That Classmate. Gewen Wanguke. What's half of Kota's question? What does hard work taste like? And that. Every day, when we feel tormented, we sing loudly. Throw off the blanket, because we don't need it anymore. We are people who don't need blankets. So cute. Yeah. So lovable. Kotoko, you must remain calm. This is it. Counting 1, 2, 3. Life... The last character, "ah," a dot. It feels like it's floating in the air. Floating in the air, got it. This is it. Life... Well done, Kotoko. I want to share the value of life with everyone. Kotoko, it's not "divide," it's "share." The topic of this discussion is "Should we keep pets in the classroom?" First, we invite the proposer of this topic, Uzuhara. Here. Everyone, try placing your hands on your chests. You can feel your heart beating, right? This is life. I want to share the value of life with everyone. By keeping pets, we will understand the value of life. I'm sorry. Over here. Okay, Yachi. Even if you don't have a pet, just touching here is enough. Isn't it still easy to understand the value of life? So noisy, you blockhead. You shouldn't say that, Kotoko. "What's all the noise about, blockhead?" What does it mean? Who gives you the right to say such things? So noisy, so noisy, blockhead. I knew something was wrong. Actually, you just want to have a pet, right? I just want to have a pet because they're so adorable. Actually, you just want to have a pet. Raise your hand before speaking. I also really want to have one. Small and soft. Raise your hand before speaking. Sounds so nice, but what comes after? You haven't thought it through at all. How come I haven't thought it through? Raise your hand before speaking. You haven't even figured out why you want to have one. How come I haven't figured it out? If you want to have one, I suggest getting a cat. That's a good idea, getting a cat. Raise your hand before speaking. If you want to have one, who will take care of it? I will take care of it. Then you can have one at home. I can't have one in my neighborhood, you blockhead. During summer vacation, who will take care of it? I will take care of it. So, just have one at home. - Raise your hand before speaking. - Didn't I say I can't have one in my neighborhood, you blockhead? Raise your hand... Raise your hand... What's wrong, Park? Everyone, look at Park, place your hand on your chest. That's right, 123, life. What's wrong, park? What's wrong, Park? Quick, call an ambulance! What's wrong? Call an ambulance, ambulance! Okay, okay. 123, life, that's 123, life. The reason Park fainted is arrhythmia. Arrhythmia. (Arrhythmia) What is arrhythmia? Arrhythmia means that the heart beats differently from usual. Some people's hearts beat fast. Some people's hearts beat slowly. Which type is Park? Park's heart beats fast. Why? The specific reason is unclear, but it suddenly started beating fast. I guess Park got too excited. What's that condition called? Is it a foreign disease? What does "got too excited" mean? Well, it means they got too anxious or panicked suddenly. When you get scared by something suddenly, your heart starts beating irregularly. Is it our fault? No, it's not. Arrhythmia attacks usually happen suddenly. I guess Park got too excited all at once. So, we shouldn't get too excited, right? Seems like it. Teacher, I should learn more about arrhythmia. Park, will you not come to class anymore? No, he will come to class. Just don't know when it might happen again. Please take care of me, everyone. Okay. Let's continue the class. Um, take out your Chinese textbooks. Arrhythmia. The title of the article is (arrhythmia hyperactivity) "The Enigma of Nature." Yes, "The Enigma of Nature." Who wants to read it? Miyoki, would you read it? Okay. The JAPONICA workbook is missing. You scared me. What's the matter, Uzuhara? You scared me. What's missing? I said it was JAPONICA, you blockhead. Did anyone see Uzumaki's JAPONICA workbook? No. Everyone, check your own drawers. See if you mistakenly took it. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Kotoko, this can cause arrhythmia. Causing panic like this. Oh no. You're okay, Uzuhara, you're not sick. Don't play sick again. Everyone, sit down. Um... If you see Uzuhara's JAPONICA remember to tell me. Okay. Let's start the class. Yuta, you read "The Enigma of Nature." Minoru Yajima. During class today, I actually had arrhythmia. What are you talking about? Coco, you don't have arrhythmia. You're just really good at imitating. I didn't pretend. Why would I pretend? I was just really panicked when that word was mentioned. how to say Quoting him with words is also a must, right? It hits the nail on the head, right? how to say I really panicked all of a sudden. Look at that fruit. It's so rare. I understand. Park will be fine. let's go Is this the place? Wow, impressive. Jun has money, and this is incomparable. what does it taste like? It tastes like icy stones. I see. Nam, Nam, look here. Park, are you still feeling unwell? I'm fine now. It's okay. The first time was probably scary for you all. Couldn't you breathe? The teacher said the heart beats irregularly Yeah. Yeah. The heart goes thump thump, faster and faster, and it feels terrible. Feels like you're about to die. Feels like you're about to die. Yeah, I thought I was going to die. It's actually nice to feel like you're about to die. Why? Because feeling like you're about to die is extraordinary. i don't want to die. You scared me. I don't want to go through that again. Why? Well, feeling like you're about to die is really cool. By the way, I almost forgot. I've come up with a nickname for you. nickname? Yeah, combining Park and panic. Panic Park, how about that? Um, let's forget it. Why forget it? It's cool, isn't it? Really? But I don't like panic. Just call me park as usual. Well, now that you mention it, Park is already like a nickname. Park is not a very special name. In Korea, it's a common surname Korea? Yeah, didn't I tell you? I'm Korean, not Japanese. First time hearing this. Then why do you speak Japanese so fluently? I only know Japanese. Just like you, right? Park's family is from a refugee background, right? No, we're not refugees. I'm coming in. Great. Here, everyone, please have some. Thank you. Here you go. Make the Calpis a bit stronger. (Calpis: a type of lactic acid beverage) Is that so? Finished drinking. Would you like another cup? It'll make me use the toilet more. I'll pass, thanks. If you want another cup, don't hesitate. Thank you. Alright, enjoy yourselves. Okay. Is your mom also Korean? Yes, my mom is a third-generation Korean in Japan. Third generation in Japan? People like us are called Zainichi Koreans. "Zainichi" means "in Japan." So, Little Park would be the fourth generation, right? So, Park would be the fourth generation, right? Something like that. Pretty cool, just like a royal. My parents came to Japan as refugees on a boat. Actually, my name is like this: Writing as Keishi, pronounced as Gyuza. Gyuza. Why do you have two names? Because I need a Japanese name. What about your mom? As for my mom, her Japanese name is Tomi, and her Korean name is Bunmi. Tomi is the same as your Tomi, huh? This Tomi is Kotoko's older sister. Bunmi is the original name for Tomi, right? The Uzuhara family is not Zainichi. So, Tomi is just Tomi. How boring. Not fun at all. Third generation in Japan, refugees who came by boat. Pretty cool. Doesn't my family have anyone cool? Like being super cool. What's wrong? I want to know where the restroom is. There's one on the second floor too. Come this way. Go on in. I really feel cool. (Park is Korean Both are Tomi, but Bunmi Park doesn't like panic) Kotoko, it's time to eat. Bunmi. What did you say? Come eat quickly. So noisy, so noisy. Just a mortal. Why doesn't anyone turn to me? Dad, come on. Is this celery? Let me report something to everyone. Eat some celery. We have something to report. Have you discovered a new way to enjoy yogurt? What is it? Dad, why don't you say it? Well, Mom will say it. Why? Dad, you say it. Well, how should I say it? Mom is pregnant. Really? Wait, when did this start? It seems like it's been four months already. The due date is January 4th. Impressive, Dad. Keep up the good work. What do you mean, keep up the good work? The due date is in January. Dad's really Amazing. Nothing much, just gave it my all. It's not easy. Coco, you'll have a little brother or sister soon. Are you happy? Not thrilled. Why? Don't ask me why. I'm just not happy at all. Why? Why is everyone so happy? That's because another member has been added to the family. It's a good thing. yes. But why? Why should we be happy when The family gets bigger? Well... When we have a little brother or sister, we'll still love Coco. And then, when the family grows, we'll move to a bigger house. Really? Aren't you eating anymore? Not eating. I'm done. What about me? I'm done. If we move, where are we going? We'll probably stay here until the baby grows up. What a shame. After the baby is born, we'll have to spend quite a bit of money. How boring. So dull. Fool. Just like in the movies. Great, that's great. Mom, thanks. I'm done eating. Oh, by the way. Ko-san Ko-san. Is Big Brother your here? He's taking a shower. When do you think he'll be done? In about two minutes. Really fast. That's called "Dragonfly Skimming the Water." What do you mean, skimming the water? Dragonfly. Dragonfly skimming the water means taking a quick shower, right? It's like when a dragonfly skims the water. Dragonfly skimming the water. Dragonfly skimming the water. Is Mom going to have a baby? Yeah, how did you know? I overheard it. Are you sighing? Yeah, at times like this, I like to sigh. Is that so? He seems to be done showering. He just finished and called you downstairs. Sorry. Is he downstairs? I'll go down in a minute. Sorry about that. I have something to say to Little Poo. I'll go and come back. No, you can't. It's already late. Don't go. Yeah. I'll go too. Aren't you taking a shower? Later. Good evening. Good evening. Ko-san, sorry about that. Is your family going to have a baby? Mm, I don't want a little brother or sister. Is that so? I'm not jealous of them. I'm just not happy. Not happy? not happy I don't understand why everyone is so happy. When the family grows, you should be happy. I don't have that kind of feeling. If you're not happy, there's no need to force yourself to say you are. You can rely on me. My words often make the atmosphere strange Become strange. Mm, I envy Park's irregular heartbeat. If only I could be like him. But, Ibiki must have been angry that day. Yeah. Right? Why did he get angry? Kotoko, you don't have an irregular heartbeat, but you imitate it. So he got angry. Imitation is imitation. But I never thought I would die like Park. But why did he get angry? I don't know. Death is not a good thing. You're healthy, so you shouldn't imitate. Why? When you feel uncomfortable, you want to die. It's really cool. I imitate so happily. Is it not allowed? Cool. Kotoko What's up? You used to imitate my way of speaking before And the teacher scolded you for it. Remember? Yeah, I remember. I know you really think I'm cool when I speak. I'm happy about that. But that's because I understand you well. Imitating others is not allowed. Why? Because others will think you're making fun of them. I'm not. I understand. I know you're not. That's why I started to think I was cool. I used to hate it. Mom also sympathized with me. I hate being pitied by others. Why do you hate it? When others say you're pitiful, why do you find it annoying? That's because you haven't been pitied by others, so you don't know. me? You think the other person is cool, but the other person feels disgusted Is that the case with Megumi? Can't i imitate her either? I understand your desire to imitate. Wearing an eye mask does look cool. But Ibiki wasn't angry. Yeah. I don't know what's different. It's difficult. I understand now. If you think it's good, then you can imitate. Otherwise, just don't, right? But how can one know whether they are happy or unhappy? Only through imagination. Imagine. Imagine. It's "imagine" in English. Imagination. Kotoko, you're a small, worthless person. As you get older, you start imagining what others are thinking. The older you get, the clearer it becomes. Kotoko aren't you afraid of death? No, not at all. Sometimes I think about dying. Is that so? Yes, so irregular heartbeats and such don't scare me at all. I think it's cool. Being a refugee on a ship is also cool. I want to die like that too. Kotoko what do you think? I'm scared. I don't want to die. Is that so? Maybe park understands the meaning of imagination better than Kotoko. Is being afraid of death imagination? Being afraid of death shows how much you value life. If Kotoko also becomes afraid of death... Maybe... maybe then you'll know. How miserable the refugee ship people are. And how park thinks about it. If you don't know, just ask him. That's not possible. You might find it painful. And might even impose greater pain on others. Imagination is important, right? That's what I think. How should you think about your own decisions? But you have to take responsibility for your thoughts. Responsibility. Doesn't Kotoko want to know what her friends think? I do. Perhaps imagination begins here. Imagine. Imagine. Imagine. (imagine) Daikokuten (God of Buddhism) Daikokuten. buddha. buddha. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Old Man Time. Don't get in the way. I'm going to Tokyo during summer vacation. I might be discovered by talent scouts. I want to go to France. Oh, does Ahn also want to go to France? That's great. You look like a little princess. Um... What is it.. The girls are whispering together again. Go away. Teacher Sawako told me to start wearing a bra during summer vacation. So, during summer vacation, I'll buy cute bras in France. That's nice. Full and elastic. Yeah. Show me. You absolutely have to show me. You have to let me see too. Everyone, look at the homework handout. Complete all the exercises for the newly assigned math problems. Write a diary for ten days. Next, practice playing the recorder. Koto teacher will have a test on it during the first class of next term. Practice hard, okay? Stop it. Also, everyone's favorite, independent exploration. I like knitting. Also, read three books. Choose one and write a book report. It should be two pages on the composition paper. Really? I can't do it. How can you say you can't do it? You've wasted your time playing during summer vacation. You've assigned us so much homework. What is the teacher going to do? Go on a date? Sit properly and let the teacher finish speaking. Write down what you need to bring when school starts in the contact notebook. Yes. The start of school is Monday, August 5th. Stationery. Shoes. Water bottle. (Go die). Go die. Uzuhara What are you doing. What's this? Looks like snow. Can you move it? Come on, be careful on the way. Imagination is indeed difficult. Did you find JAPONICA? No. Did you put it in a special place? Where is the special place? In the toilet? Music room? It won't be there. I wouldn't take it to such strange places. Strange places? I've reached my limit. What's this? Your math is really terrible. Make sure to complete this summer's homework according to the plan. Homework handouts posted on the toilet door Post it where you can see it. So you can see it every day. Post it. I want to drink Calpis. Grandma will make it for you. Pour a little more. This amount is just right. I want it stronger. Has your taste changed? Go die. The Old Man Time on the cabinet is missing one. Where did it go? I don't know. Since the first day I met Old Man Time, I hear a crisp sound on the ground every night in my dreams. My chest feels suffocated. It's just not possible. If I make them with these stones, they'll be too heavy to take to school. Yeah. I had a dream too. I dreamt of fish laying eggs. And then? That's all there was. What are you doing here? What grade are you in? Third grade I'm going to open it. You're in the way. Move. The lock is so rusty. Can't they replace it? Didn't you ask them to replace it? I already told them. No, you do it. Really annoying. If they replaced both the lock and the rabbit, it would be great If they do replace it, give me the rabbit. Why are you all still here? Open it. It's so dirty. When I clean, I can take them for a walk. Do you want to take them for a walk? Do you guys really like rabbits? Sure, but how can you like such dirty rabbits? We like them because they're cute. Then it would be great if you could bring them back later. Kotoko. Do rabbits know how many they are? Who knows? It stinks. It's too much. That fifth-grade girl is always complaining. Yes, she is. It must be her period. What's a period? I heard it's a secret for girls. It's here. Have you brought it? I think so. How many have you collected? Seven. Wow, you've collected seven already. The smaller ones are easier to catch. Really? It's here. Great! You're getting better at killing mosquitoes now. Maybe. To be honest, is this really considered an exploration assignment? The title is "A Summer of Mosquitoes and Blood." It's so hot. So hot. Got it. Lit it up. It's about to fall. Let's kill them together. Come over here. Totoro is here. They're not eating. Oh, they're eating now. They're eating a lot. Next week, I'm going to stay at my grandmother's house in Songshan with my family to pay respects to our ancestors. Really? We'll stay for two nights, so I won't be around then. Then we can stop by to burn incense. Really? It's so hot. What are you doing? I'm going to park's house now. Let's all go together. Okay. Hmm. Stop messing around. Stop messing around. Explain clearly what you mean by "the test results are not good." What are we supposed to do now? Hello? Hello? Everyone said they're going back. Uzuhara-san Aren't you going back? Yeah, I'm going back too. Park never thought about dying, right? No, never. Never thought about it. Never thought about making someone die. But there are people I want to protect. Hello. Hello. Are you playing alone? Look at the "S" on my chest. Even if you turn it upside down, it's still an "S." S S Who are you? can you step on my face? What? can you step on my face? can you step on my face? Kotoko. You're here so late. Sorry. Rabbit is waiting for you. Here you go. Let's go. It's so hot. yes. Wait, Rabbit. Wait. Step on it a few more times. Step on it again. Step on it hard. I'm wearing long pants. Your legs got bitten by mosquitoes, right? My legs got really bitten. I was so itchy while driving that I almost had an accident. Sorry, wait for me a moment. Uzuhara what are you doing? Why are you here? Even teachers have work during the summer vacation. Really? Hurry up and go home. Okay. The teacher has left. Let's go together. Don't talk to me. Hurry up and go home. Okay. what is that kid doing? I don't understand what children are thinking. Right? Why are they like this? They went through the same thing themselves. Oh, Mr. Ishida. I still feel a little worried. I'll go check again. Then I'll leave first. Take care. Take care. Goodbye. I'm back. I'm back. Kotoko is back. Oh, great. I saw her near the staircase over there. Stop, Kotoko. That's unacceptable. Was there no one at Park's house? Did you play by yourself today? Oh, my goodness. What happened to your face? And there's blood on your knee. Oh, my, did you get into a fight? She said she fell down. Fell down? Oh, my. Doesn't it hurt? No, it doesn't. It looks painful. Come here, Coco. Let me wipe you with a towel. You have to take care of her. wash it well. How did you fall? Oh, my, it's going to scar. Sorry for keeping you waiting, everyone.

Are you close with Kanarimi? Let me go. Then please do. Actually, I'm moving after the second semester. Why? My parents are getting divorced. I'll be living with my mom from now on. Will you go to a different school after that? Yes. But I checked the district zoning, We'll attend the same junior high school in the future. It's still three years away. Actually, three and a half years. After three and a half years, everyone will have changed, right? After three and a half years, everyone will have changed, right? How will we change? Well, boys and girls gradually stop talking to each other. Why? Because they reach puberty. Puberty? Kanarimi's house is really far. Yeah.
