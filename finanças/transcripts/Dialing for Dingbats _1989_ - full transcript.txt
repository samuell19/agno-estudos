Oh. Oh. [WOMAN MOANING] MAN (ON TV): Meet little Melvin. He's a 90-pound weakling. Everyone hated Melvin. Yeah, I'm gonna take this mop and shove it down your throat. MAN (ON TV): They teased him. I'm gonna do it with you. OK. MAN (ON TV): They taunted him. They tormented him until he had a horrifying accident and fell into a vat of nuclear waste, transforming little Melvin into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength. Melvin became the Toxic Avenger, the first superhero born out of nuclear waste. Are you lonely? Has your life been a boring disaster? Let's face it. When was the last time you had a real date? Have your phone calls to women been something like this? Hello, is Becky home? No, she's out on a date. Can I tell her who is calling? Oh, no, never mind, no one. Are fat women in lingerie shops ruining your social life? Are you making a fool of yourself in grocery stores by knocking apples all over the floor in front of pretty women? If any of these situations apply to you, then it's obviously too late. It's time to pack it in. You're a hopeless case. Maybe it's time you called Fast Frank's Funeral Parlor, where you check in, but you don't check out. Fast Frank's, where your guaranteed reservation is our guaranteed preservation. So call right now.

[SIGHING] [PHONE DIALING] Picture, if you will, a lonely guy, a man of desperation seeking companionship in the simple pleasures of life, like being with the opposite sex, a man whose ways of dealing with women have failed him time and time again. Is this man destined for failure, or is it that he just hasn't found the right way to connect yet? Maybe it's time our friend took a trip into the Party Line Zone. Hey, kid, you look a little down there. Looks like you need something to cheer you up. Well, I just happen to have exactly what you need. See, I've been watching you fumble your way around those felines out there. You have, have you? Who, may I ask, are you? Who am I? Glad you asked. Ernie Bernay is the name. Party line is my game. Oh, too slow, cold. Party line, what are you talking about? You know, it's a shame, kid. There are so many lonely guys and girls out there that have a lot of trouble trying to find a decent match. Now, I just happen to own my own telephone party line for men and women to talk together and meet one another. And trust me. Guys do meet girls all the time. Girls, party lines, great. So, uh, what's the catch? There's no catch. All you need is a telephone, a little direction, and a little effort on your part, and-- And? And me, of course. You? I don't even know you. What are you gonna do for me? You've been having a lot of trouble trying to meet women lately, am I right? Don't know exactly what to say to get their attention-- Well-- ---get them to give you their phone number, to get them to go out on a date with you. Does this ring a bell? [BELL RINGING] Well, pal, hey. Let me Introduce you to the party line. I don't think so. Come on. Hey, how about if we start right now? Waiter. He wants to start when? Let me show you how it's done, kid. The first lesson is you gotta learn how to be a smooth talker. It's like this. When you make a call on the party line, you can get connected with up to eight different people at one time. You see, the goal of the party line is to get the girl's phone number so that you can call her off the line. This way, you could talk to her longer, alone. You follow me? Just watch me go to work. Go to school on me. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello, who just called in? Uh, this is Ernie. What's up, Ophelia? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Not much. How you been? I've been great. Listen, are any chicks on the line? WOMAN (ON PHONE): It's been pretty slow today, but there is one person on the line right now. Say hi to Star from Diamond Bar. Hey, Star, what's happening? STAR (ON PHONE): Oh, not much. Where are you calling from? What's all that noise in the background? I'm outside in a cafe by the beach. STAR (ON PHONE): So what do you do for a living? Funny you should ask. I just happen to own this party line you and I are talking on. STAR (ON PHONE): Yeah, I've heard that line before. No, seriously, I really do. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yeah, he really does. He occasionally signs my paycheck every week if he's on time. STAR (ON PHONE): Wow, that's interesting. I'm just an aspiring actress. Oh, yeah? You know, a lot of the operators that I hire are aspiring actresses. It just so happens, uh, I'm in the need of some new operators. Maybe we could exchange phone numbers. STAR (ON PHONE): Yeah, maybe we should exchange phone numbers. Well, how about if we, uh, talk about it over dinner? STAR (ON PHONE): Dinner, yeah, well, maybe. Here's my number, 714-- [LOUD ENGINE] I'm sorry. I didn't catch that. STAR (ON PHONE): What? It's uh, some-- it was too noisy. I didn't catch that. 358, what? STAR (ON PHONE): 714-- [LOUD ENGINE] --be hearing from you soon, so call me. Bye. Hello? Hello? Hello? Jesus Christ. Lesson number two, always call from a place you can hear from. Right, I'll keep that in mind. [SIGHING] MAN: Lonely? Bored? Do you feel like your social life is a waste? Do you find that meeting girls for you is a mountainous task? Maybe it's time you got ahead of the game by calling the hottest party line in town, 555-BLAB, where you can talk to several people at one time-- the most fun you can have without even leaving your home. So if you'd like to meet girls like this-- Oh, come on, Ernie. Get real. You can't meet a girl like that on a party line. Are you kidding me? Where do you think I got that girl from? So what you're trying to tell me is I can meet girls like that on some dumb party line, huh? Kid, there's plenty of picking out there, and it ain't so dumb. That's why I started one myself, to see people like you get matched up, so to speak. So tell me, Mr. Ernie, is that the only reason you started your party line service? Well, in a way, it all started many, many, many years ago, back in '86, when I found myself in the midst of all the-- [HISSING] Did you, uh, did you say, mist? No, midst, not mist, I said midst. I found myself in the midst of all those lonely guys without gals, guys that had trouble meeting girls one on one. Basically, kid, these cats were sad, know what I mean? So I decided, hey, you got pizzazz, good looks, charm, et cetera, nice clothes. Why not though the kindness of your own heart help these sad sacks out? And what better way to do it than with a party line. So that's what I did. I started my own party line, and now these guys ain't so lonely anymore. Hey, hey, way to go. I don't know, man. It sounds too good to be true. I mean, you could be BSing me about this whole thing, you know, meeting girls, helping lonely guys, your kindness of heart. I don't know, man. OK, all right, that's it. I gotta show you something. Just come with me. You rang. Thank you, Butler. Recycling Razorblades for Fun and Profit, negative. Attracting Girls with Chi. Pictionary for the Blind, I don't think so. Ernie's Greatest TV Moments, bingo. Tonight, I am proud to present to you the forerunner of telephone dating technology, the king of party lines, a man with finesse in excess who has helped hundreds of guys and girls with the dating scene. What can I say about this man that hasn't already been said in small claims court? Here he is, Ernest J. Bernay. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ernie, how does it feel to be quite literally the talk of the town? Well, you know, Lana, it wasn't easy. In fact, I'd like to thank all the little people I had to step on to get here. Um, Mr. Bernay, what made you decide to start a telephone dating service? A party line. What? It's a party line, not a dating service. Well, what difference should that make? Well, in a regular dating service situation, you pay for what you get. I mean, you get what you pay for. And in my case, you don't know what you end up getting, and you pay for it anyway. Well, yes, but don't you think that that's unfair to the people that call in? Unfair, why? At least you're getting to talk to a person you will eventually end up meeting. You see, Lana, the emphasis here is on getting to know one's personality, not the looks. The looks are deceiving. I mean, would you go out on a date with me after only seeing my picture? Um, I don't think so. You see? But would you consider me for a date after having just talked to me on the telephone? Oh, well, no. That's it. [LAUGHTER] People don't even get that far in a single's bar. I see. Um, yeah, that's nice, but what are the real advantages of phone date-- I mean party lines-- opposed to meeting someone in a bar, for example? Bars? Bars are ugly, and they smell. People are drunk. I mean, what could be a more deceiving environment for people to meet? How about Disneyland? Disneyland? Let's not talk about the competition. Anyway, party lines, boys and girls, it's the only way to go. Trust me. We'll be back for more after a word from our sponsor. [MUSIC PLAYING] You see that, kid? It's legit. I'm legit. So what do you got to worry about? Now, are you going to give it a shot, or are you just going to wimp out on me? Wimp out on you? What are you talking about wimp out on you? Let's just say I'm putting the ball in your court, now see if you can dribble. Anyway, are you game or not? I tell you what, look. I'll even put the first one on my tab. This one's on me. What do you say? I don't know. Come on. Go for it. What have you got to lose? Shit. All right. That's it. What was the number again? Oh. Hello, who just called in? Hi, I-- I'm Randy. Thrilling. Where are you calling from? I'm calling from Redondo, but, uh, but this is my first time calling the line. Great, OK, everybody. Here we go. Let's all say hi to Randy from Redondo. Hi, I'm Star from the Diamond Bar. I'm Dino from Chino. Well, howdy, y'all. This is Dustin from Tustin. Hi, this is Florence from Torrence. Yo, Adrianne, this is Dennis from Venice. Oh, my God. I am so sure. This is Sally from the Valley. Like, hello? Hey, this is Robin from Rosita. Um, this is my first time calling a party line, too. This is really crazy, all these people talking on the same line at once. Yeah, it does get kind of crazy out here, but I reckon you can get used to it. Ooh, your accents sounds, like, totally awesome and, like, rugged, dude. Well, I never heard an accent like yours before. What country are you from? Uh, like, what country? I am so sure. This is, like, LA, like, the Valley, you know? Well, I never been to the Valley, but I hear it's a real kick. It's totally the place to be. You should come and visit some time. I know all the rad places to go. Hey, Dustin, why don't ya go for it? It sounds like Sally really likes you. Why don't you two round up y'all's phone numbers and call each other? Well, that sounds like a swell idea. If the little lady wouldn't mind giving me a call, my number is 999-1212. I'll call for sure. That's totally cool. Hang up so I can call. Bye, y'all. Bye. Hi, this is Donnie from El Mani. Hey, where's all the women? Aren't you looking for a boy's line? Listen, kid, you gotta be more aggressive with these chicks. Don't wait for them to talk to you. You gotta make the first move. Now, go ahead and try and get their attention this time. Hi, this is Randy again. I'm interested in, uh, hiking and camping. Anybody else? Oh, well, me, oh, I'm into the arts. I want to be an actress. I want to be discovered. I want to see my name in lights on Hollywood Boulevard. Well, baby, you want to be in pictures, do ya? Well, it so happens that I'm a film producer. Why don't you give me a call sometime? Maybe over dinner, we'll talk about it. Dinner, huh? Wait a minute. What kind of movies do you make? Don't worry, sweetheart. You won't have to take all your clothes on my film. Oh, I love a producer with a great sense of humor. Why don't you give me a call? My number is 714-860-2557. OK, baby, I'll give you a buzz right now. No, no, no, you gotta act quick, my man. Try finding something in common with one of these chicks and make some conversation. Yeah? -How about that Robin chick? -Yeah. She sounds hot. Yeah, yeah she does. What are you waiting for? Go for it. Hi, Robin, are you still there? ROBIN (ON PHONE): Yeah, right here. Uh, this is Randy again. So tell me what kind of things you like to do. What are you interested in? Well, I like to go to the movies. Um, I like to camp. I love to swim, things like that. Someone else on here liked to camp, too. That wasn't you, was it? Yeah, was me. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm a camping fanatic, and, uh, I love swimming, too. As a matter of fact, I was kind of thinking of going for a swim later this afternoon. Hello, who just called in? Hey, Ophelia, it's Dave from Bel Air. What's going on? Any new ladies on the line? Oh, no, it's him. Hi, Dave, Robin is on the line. She's now. Well, hello, there, Robin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, I am talking to, um-- Excuse me, I didn't mean to, uh, interrupt, but I-- You know, I was talking to-- OK, wait a minute. Who's this? This is Dave from Bel Air. Where are you calling from? I'm from Rosita. Bel Air, huh? A pretty ritzy place, so what do you do for a living? Oh, I work. Would you like to know where I work? Well, I, uh, you know, uh, independently wealthy. How about yourself? Me? Well, I'm just a fashion consultant, but it pays the bills. I wash Volkswagens. Robin, what a coincidence. I happen to be in the fashion industry, also. Oh, really? What do you do? What do I do? Well, I work in a-- really, I manage a-- actually, I-- I own a clothing store, yeah. Hello? Hello? What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy or something? I was just trying to get somewhere with her. Oh, no, no, grasshopper. What do you mean, no, no, no, grasshopper? I was just starting to get somewhere with this chick, and you go and cut me off. Randy, Randy, you coulda been a contender. You recall lesson number one? Be a smooth talker. Lesson number two, always call from a place you can hear from. Lesson number three, you be aggressive, which brings us to lesson number four. Don't lie 'cause it'll come back to you. Trust me. You'll see. Get back on the line, this time without the bullshit. All right, all right. You never did tell me what you do you? I know you said you were independently wealthy, but what do you do? I'll let you know when I get to know you a little bit better. Hey, I got the perfect idea for us to get acquainted. I'm having a little party with a few of my close friends, and I'd love you to come. Oh, a little party, how little? Oh, not too little, you know, a few of my close friends, you know, just a few hundred. Well, I don't think so. No, thanks. RANDY (ON PHONE): Robin, are you still there? Randy? What happened to you? Yeah, well, my stupid dog pulled the phone cord out on me, and I, uh, got disconnected. Well, I'm glad your back. Listen, uh, I was wondering. Do you like French food? I like french fries und Bratwurste. Well, as a matter of fact, I do. Really? Great, listen I know this, uh, nice little cafe near the beach. Maybe we could meet there for lunch, say, tomorrow afternoon and possibly go swimming afterwards. That sounds interesting. It could be fun. Um, whereabouts is this place? It's on Ventura and Flower. It's called Mimi's. Why don't you meet me there, like, at 2 o'clock. And meet me out in front OK, and, uh, don't forget to bring your bathing suit. All right. All right, I'll see you there. Bye. MAN: End of part one, intermission. MAN: Hungry? Thirsty? Bored? Well, so what? It's break time. Now is the time to get up and stretch your legs. Get some fresh air. Perhaps you can make yourself a sandwich and maybe get something to drink. How about a nice warm-- how about a nice cold glass of milk or two, perhaps a cold shower? Red licorice is always nice. MAN: End of intermission, part two. Robin, I presume? Randy? You're early. Yeah, I couldn't wait to meet you. It looks crowded here. I've got another place in mind that isn't so crowded. Let's take my car. Well, OK. Which one is Robin? WOMAN: When I'm done after a long, hard, tiring day of work, I want a quick, easy, safe way to meet a nice, friendly, fun guy. So I just call 555-BLAB, the quick, easy, and safe telephone party line. That's 555-BLAB. Hey, my house is just up the street a bit. You don't mind if we stop in for a minute, do ya? I thought you said you were from Redondo. Yeah, well, originally I'm from Redondo, but I recently moved here for tax purposes. Wow, all this from owning just one clothing store? One, who ever said I just own one? You're, uh, welcome to come in, if you'd like. I think I've seen this place before. It's quite possible. "LA Today" just shot a special here a little while ago. Oh, really? When was that? Oh, about three, four years ago. It must have been pretty exciting for you. Not really, no more exciting than being with three or four nymphos in the back of my limo. Anyhow, how about if we take a swim before lunch? We can work up an appetite. Yeah, I'd, uh, rather not swim on a full stomach anyways. So, you, um, live here by yourself? Yeah, it's no big deal. By the way, you did bring your swimsuit, didn't ya? I've, uh, I've already got it on. Would you, uh, like a drink? Yeah, I'll take one. My God, this water is freezing. Don't worry. I'll go turn up the heater. Oh, shit. Randy, could you hand me a-- Randy? What the hell is going on? Now, I told you, Dave, if you ever broke into my house again, I'd call the police. Dave? MAN: Aren't you getting bored with walking through life all by yourself? Are you tired of being rejected and stepped on? If so, you may end your search now and join the party. Blab, the ultimate connection to make new friends, and don't forget. If you're under 18, get Mommy's permission first. [WHISTLING] All right, get up, maggot. We got work to do. I'll dial, and you talk. Good morning. Oh, shit, not you again. Rise and shine. No way, man. I ain't calling that stupid party line again. I got stood up last night. Oh, so, hey, it happens. Everyone gets stood up. Look, hey, the best way to get on a horse is to fall off it, right? What? Wait a minute. That's not what I mean. Listen, if at first you don't succeed, you get on the horse and ride it. No, wait. You know what I'm saying. Come on, Randy. Give it another shot, OK? No way. There's a lot more fish in the pond, I mean, lake. You know what I'm talking about. I gave it a shot last night, OK? I called. I did all that stuff. I got stood up. I'm not going to go through that again, OK? How do you know something didn't happen, huh? The least you could do is find out. Hey, I just got a feeling about this one. Think so, huh? Definitely, come on. Give it a shot. I don't know why I'm doing this. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello? Who just called in? Go on. Say hi. Hi, this is Randy from Redondo. You sound a little down. What's the matter? Oh, that Robin chick, she stood me up. I was looking forward to meeting her, really was, but instead I just waited. And I waited, and I waited. Hello, who just joined the line? It's Donnie from El Mani. Your prayers have been answered. Hi, who's just joined us now? Men, men, where are the men? Oh, hi, Veronica, Donnie's on the line. Uh, uh, hey. Hey good looking, what's cooking? Cooking? What? Anyway, are there any men on the line? Hello, who just called in? It's me, Robin, from Rasita. And, boy, am I mad. It's Robin. She's on the line. She says she's mad, right. Oh, yeah, what happened? I was supposed to meet this Randy guy, and instead I met that jerk, Dave. He pretented to be Randy, completely humiliated me. Dave? You met some guy named Dave? Dave who? Randy, God, I'm sorry. Oh, don't worry about it. I didn't mind waiting all night. And I would have rather given you the 10-pound box of chocolate than eating them myself, and flowers, the three dozen roses that I had that were left wilting in my hand. Chocolate and flowers? You did that for me? Sure, why not? Anyway, this Dave guy, I can't believe he did that to you, jerk, what an idiot. Don't worry, though, it'll catch up to him. Hello, who just called in? Hi, this is Dexter from Westchester. Marvelous, Dexter, huh? Let me guess-- glasses, bow tie, plaid shirt, and computers, right? You're pretty smart for just an operator. Oh, brother. Who else just called in? It's only me, Wendy from Westminster. Oh, I know you. You're the one they call the Spinster from Westminster, right? Right, but you can just call me Wendy. Oh, Dexter, I have the perfect match for you. I'd like for you to meet the Spinster from Westminster. Hi, there, Spinster. Can I call you Spin for short? Wendy will do. Wendy will do what? Actually, I work with computers. I have my own IBM AT personal computer with 30 meg hard drive and dual floppy. I've got a similar system. In fact, I just bought a letter quality printer that prints over 500 characters per second. 500 characters per second? Well, uh, I have a dot matrix printer, but mine only prints 180 characters per second. Do you think our systems would be compatible? Well, you know, I don't know. I mean, at the rate of 180 characters per second and minus 500 characters per second, I don't know. But we could try the floppy disk. With a hard drive in it with three megabytes, the two could be compatible. And if we mated through a Y-plug, then I think definitely the two could be working. And then, who knows where we can go from there? Well, hey, Spin, why don't you pull out a piece of paper from your 1255 double matrix printer and write down Dexter's phone number? But she doesn't have my number. Well, try giving it to her, and she will. Right, Spin? Yeah, that would be fine. Oh, it-- it's, um, 824-2133. That's a 213 area code. Uh, you've got to hang up if you want me to call you. Oh, right. Right, good point. OK. Bye. Bye, everybody. Hi, who's there? This is Lina from Gardena. Hi, everybody. Hey, any babes on the line? No, this is Lina. It's my first time calling. Whoa, a virgin caller, huh? Um, I guess. Listen, Lina, how about you give me a call? Well, uh-- Look, Lina, I could meet a thousand babes on this party line, but I-- Wait a minute. I knew that voice sounded familiar. Yeah, and so did that corny line. It's that creep, Dave, isn't it? It sure is. You know him, too, huh? Let me guess. You fell for his mansion trick? Yeah, I sure did. Whoa, hold it. Who are you? Who are you chicks? Oh, boy, you're busted now, Dave. Give it up, Dave, you scumbag. It's all over, Dave. You're history, Dave. You're dead meat, Dave. Yo, that's right, Dave. You've had it. Ah! I'm melting! Ah! Now that he's gone, things will get better. Thank you for defending my honor. Yo, babe, it was nothing, man. I just-- Robin, oh, it was nothing. I'd do it any time for you. At your service any time. But you were wonderful, taking control, pushing above and beyond the call of duty, and, last but not least, proving your manhood by making the party line a better place to call. Now that that creep's gone, let me tell you all about the party line pizza party, if anybody's interested. Yeah. It's tomorrow at 7 o'clock at Ye Olde Pizza Parlor. We have tables reserved. Hey, Robin, uh, are you gonna be going? Sounds great, Randy. Are you gonna be there? Yeah, well, I don't know. What are you talking about? You'll be there. Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. Um, sure, I'll be there. Hey, uh, why don't we-- why don't we go together? Well, that sounds like fun. Hey, I know. Why don't you meet me in front of the pet store at the Valley Mall, say, oh, 6:07 PM, right after I get my hair done? And this time, you won't be able to miss me. I'll be wearing a red carnation. Oh, great, sounds great. Listen, I'll be there at 6:00 sharp, but do me a favor. Don't take any ride from any strangers this time, all right? All right, see you there. All right, see you tomorrow. Bye. I don't know. I guess these party lines ain't so bad after all. Everything in moderation, kid. You know the old saying. Too much of a bad thing can be too much of a good thing. Too much of a-- just never mind. OK, one last time, this is your brain, and this is a party line. This is your brain on the party line, and this is what happens when you call too much. Any questions? Honey, don't take the phone. You'll kill yourself. Whips and chains and dildos, oh, gotta go. Hi, my name is Susie. And if you have a problem with a party line addiction and don't know where to turn, stay tuned, and I'll be right back to take your reservation. Uh, first I was just calling once a week, then once a day. Pretty soon, I was calling the party line 24 hours a day. [BELLS CHIMING] I needed help. That's when I called Party Liners Anonymous and checked into the Toll House I tell ya, that one phone call really changed my life. I don't know what happened. I-- I just lost control. I thought I could quit being a party line caller, but-- but it became my worst habit. Then I found out about Party Liners Anonymous. I don't even own a phone anymore. It's a miracle. Those people at Toll House really understand my problem because they've been there before. I stopped-- I stopped going outside, eating, and sleeping. I lost my friends and my wife and my job.
