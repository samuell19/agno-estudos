The body was found about four weeks after the circus left town. - [Man] Inspector, why are you telling me this? - The man was a transient. The last time he was seeing was when he was snatching a bag from this woman. - This is an old photo. Are you sure you have the right woman? - May I? She disappeared right after her bag was stolen. We identified her through home video shot at the circus. (dramatic music) - [Father] Mary Lou Sommers. - [Inspector] You want to tell me about her? Like why you filed a missing persons report on her? - First, I need to know more about this murder. Specifically, how was he killed? - Well the consensus of opinion is he was killed by a wolf. The only thing is, is that this wolf would have had to been twice the size of the hound of the Baskervilles. - What? - Hound of the Baskervilles, it was a Sherlock. - What else, inspector, what else? - Well, according to the experts, the wolf attacked while up, standing on its hind legs. That would have made it well over six feet tall. - Do you know what sort of wolf killed this man? - A very big one?

I believed in Santa Claus till I was eight years old. - I'm not a flippant man nor a religious zealot, but everything I'm about to tell you is based on fact not supposition. - Okay, facts I can deal with. - These facts go back 500 years. - Excuse me, 500 years? - [Father] Yes. - This is going to be a long story? - Especially if you keep interrupting. - Point taken. - Late in the 15th century inspector, the Vatican sent an inquisition team to Hungary near Budapest because there had been reports of a werewolf sighting. The night before the team arrived at the castle, Count Shusko poisoned everyone, then killed himself and his wife, Of course their deaths were seen in his admission of guilt. And without exorcism, it meant that the evil still prevailed within the castle. The inquisition believed that Satan had taken the castle under his protection. They ordered the castle to be razed. Three times they set fire to it but each time the fire went out. After that, no one would even walk in the shadow of the castle's walls, let alone set foot inside it. - The bar actually made a little profit. Considering that a certain someone never writes down anything that he spends our drink. - Then get rid of them of him Harriet. I don't want anybody around that can't do their job. What are you smiling at? - Oh, nothing.

(upbeat country music) - So, did I pass? - Wasn't a test. - Wasn't it? - Tell me what you're really doing in Pioneer town. - The whole place was boarded up and forgotten until 1987 when the communist government in its infinite wisdom decided the place would make an excellent tourist attraction. The first group that included the woman in your photograph. When they walked up the stairs that day, like the occupants of the castle 500 years ago, they too were destined never to get out alive. The official story was that they had gotten lost during a freak blizzard in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the castle. A subsequent fire destroyed the castle, caused the tunnels to collapse and made the bodies impossible to recover. That was the official story. - Excuse me for interrupting, do you have another name? I feel a bit self conscious and I don't mean any disrespect. - You can call me John. - John, that's good, John. It's getting late, it's 12:45 and I'd really like to take a rain check on the rest of the story. Not that it's not interesting. I just think it's a tad more than I'd expected.

Well I was the one that was surprised because when I was walking up my, my door, there was Pappy, give them singing lessons to this little blonde and I opened the door and I said. - God this urinals small. - [Harriet] I wrote this for him from the bottom of my heart. - You reckon it's small Ted? - What? - Its small, isn't it? - Cocktail weenie Brock.

He better be working over there. - Oh yeah, he's over at the bar. - Thanks for looking hun. - Okay. - You're an hour late Jaro. (dramatic country music) - Jim, you seen Ted? - I think he's over there. (dramatic country music) Ted, Cheryl was looking for you. - That's the story of my life Jim. - She's over there. - Now Jim, you missed a bit there. (men chuckling) (eerie music) - [Ted] Cheryl, you looking for something? - Well, yes, actually I was looking for you. You know that drunk, the one you had the fight with last night? - [Ted] Yeah. - He disappeared this morning. - Disappeared? What's that got to do with me? - Well Harriet asked me to see if you knew anything about it. - No. Why would I know anything about it? - Well, didn't you hear him screaming, you were outside weren't you? About three o'clock this morning. - No, no, I was asleep, I was dead to the world. Sorry Cheryl, no. - The tour guide told the real story to a priest as he was dying. A freak blizzard had blown up that night. Stranding. None of them seem overly concerned. They were not to know that the spirit of the werewolf had already assumed the identity of one of the group. Even as they were enjoying their drinks, the beast among them was planning their demise. When they went to explore the castle, the killing started. The werewolf was picking them off one by one. They could not bring themselves to accept the truth. They thought one of the group must have gone insane. Ted, the only Australian became the fall guy and he was never seen again (dramatic chord) As panic set in, the killings continued. (dramatic music) No one was sure who to trust. They took sides out of sheer desperation. Finally, there were only three of them left. (dramatic music) Each of the men thought the other was the werewolf. And it was Mary Lou who made the final choice. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) The wrong one. - That's quite a bit to absorb John. Mind if we just kind of take a break and get a little fresh air? (dramatic country music) - I don't understand why you sent that drunk Davis here. You're going to blow my cover. Seem crazy to me. Luckily, he's gone. I don't know. Okay, bye. (dramatic chord) (suspenseful music) - Exercise is good. Helps me think, the oxygen refreshes my brain. - I wouldn't have taken you for someone interested in physical fitness inspector. - Oh, I watch a lot of football. I once had a friend that died of jogging. I just went out and the first time he just fell over, died. - Well, that's terrible. How old was he? - 94. - you're making fun of me inspector. - No. - Ted said he was asleep, but I'm positive it was him outside that man's room. - Why would he lie? Unless he had something to hide. - That's what worries me. Especially since I'm sure it was that man Brett Davis's briefcase under Ted's bed. - Hi Cheryl, hi Bonnie. - Hi. - Can you give me some help at the bar for a minute? - Sure. - Okay. ♪ Lead the wolves away from the door ♪ ♪ That's the only things aman like me is good for ♪ - Jaro, Did you hear any noises last night?

Are you going to walk or ride? - Hey Jack, how come you wearing Jacqueline shirt? (Jaro chuckles) (engine rumbling) - That's how we heard the story. The count told the priest as he was dying, remember? - That confession. - The count was wrong, David was found dead. Mary Lou was never seen again. - Until now. - Yes inspector. - [Woman] I thought you may like some tea. - Thank you Sybil. - You're a police man. I've got a son that's in Burstow and he's got a wife and her friend's a policemen. I've got another daughter, she lives here too. But I've got another three daughters, but they're not all there. - Thank you Sybil, you can go now. - It's been a real pleasure meeting you and I hope when you go to Burstow you'll look, my son up. - We're in Burstow. - Oh, never do know where I am. - Sybil. - [Sybil] Stupid. - Time is running out for us inspector. - Us? - You can't do this by yourself. I'm going to provide you with some pastoral support. - Listen, I appreciate your offer, but. - Inspector there's more. - More? I knew it. I'm going to warn you though on becoming shockproof. - Good. Because very soon it will be three years to the day since that Hungarian castle burned to the ground. Three years is the time it takes a werewolf to grow to full strength, to reach maturity, if you please. Inspector I've already checked the calendar. This date will coincide with our upcoming full moon. - I take it back, a full moon? I know this is going to get worse. - But the conjunction of these forces will be devastating. Once a werewolf does developed fully then behold its first full moon it becomes in engorged with an awesome new power. - I don't want to hear about it. What? - Now inspector, your werewolf will be able to change others into its own kind. - And how do you know all this? - I've always known the theories of werewolves. - You realized that if I told my superiors this story, they'd probably have me committed. - Then the less said the better. - Cheryl, I got the key. - Ted's room?

I'm telling you for a moment I just thought, you know. - I'm serious Ted, whatever was spooking the deer was not normal. - Not normal? - No. - Oh, well that really narrows the field.

(slow country music) (suspenseful music) - I'm really scared, that's why I called you. Father do you believe in werewolves? - What do werewolves have to do with you? - They tried to kill me. - Hello? Is this the chief ranger? Could you tell him if there's been any mountain lion activity reported in the Joshua tree area? (suspenseful music) Well, a friend told me. I'm sorry, no. (suspenseful music) Could you just please answer my question? (suspenseful music) - Bonnie, this isn't blood on the shirt, it's red paint. - Paint would cover a man's blood on a shirt. - What's got into you, Bonnie? - Ted, Harriet. There's something more going on in this town than just that body you buried. - Oh my God, look. It was in his pocket. - Brett Davis's ID card. What was it doing in Ted's shirt? - He told Eveanne he didn't know him. (knocking) - Excuse me, Harriet. Can I see you for a moment? - Thanks Jaro. (suspenseful music) - They found a man buried at the monument. Says he was attacked by some wild animal. Unconfirmed confirmed reports. Said there's been sightings of an animal that looked almost half human. - That's why the ranger wouldn't tell you anything. - You see that woman in the newspaper who they want a question about the killing? I found this in Brett Davis's room after he disappeared. - I think you'd better call the cops. - You know I'm a writer and I had this nervous breakdown. Well, the doctor said that I needed to get away. So Richard my husband, found this really nice secluded place in the mountains and the people there were really friendly. Probably too friendly. I had no idea that this place was actually a colony for werewolves. - A colony? Of course. - Excuse me? - Nothing, I'm sorry I interrupted. - I wasn't feeling very well. I had taken a couple of sleeping pills and was waiting for Richard to come back from his walk. She wasn't there by accident. She wanted Richard. (dramatic music) I knew he was hurt. He told me that she had attacked him, that she was a werewolf. But the next day he changed his story. He said it was all in my mind. My imagination overreacting again, all he had was a scratch. That night we had an argument. He wouldn't listen. He just got angry and left the house. I heard his screams, there were frightening. (dramatic music) He was changing and there was nothing I could do. I had to get away. (dramatic music) I realized they would come after me, that I would never be free. So I returned to Draco. (engine rumbling) And pretended to hide in the bell tower. They came after me. And when they were inside, I locked the doors and set the place on fire. (bell tower booming) (screaming) No one survived, not even my husband. So that's it. What should I do? - Marie, I want to show you something. (briefcase clattering) - What is it? - Do you know this woman? - No. But this, this is the man. He worked on a tow truck. (dramatic music) I thought I killed him, but. (phone ringing) Hello? Hold on, it's an inspector Kester inspector for you. - Inspector? The police think they found this man. - What, he's here? - Okay, I wrote this song about people my age that realize drug use is a waste of time. And you guys all know the words, so sing along.

Jack? Jack! (bottles clattering) - Eveanne, Ted tried to bring George Jones. (Eveanne chuckles) - He's trying to convert the world. - [Teds Casset] The place is made up of dropouts and misfits. People trying to keep alive dreams that never had any hope of fulfillment. They live in a past as they have invented, justifying their wrongdoings, blaming society for all their ills. The dirt is everywhere. It's a regular landmine of drama and intrigue. I feel safe here. The shade conspiracies hiding out with protected secrets. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry. You weren't meant to hear this. (dramatic music) (door clatters) - Are you going to hold him until the inspector comes from LA? - Something like that. - You I think he's the killer? - That's what we're going to find out. (car door bangs) (dramatic music) (cops knocking) - Would you mind stepping outside? - What? - Step outside. Yeah, you and I are going somewhere and having a little talk. - Hey, what's this about? - That's for me to know and you to find out. (dramatic music) (door creaks) Get in there. Now I'm going to ask you some questions and you better hope I like the answers. - Fuck you. - Now what about that fight you had last night? - Guy was trying to kill me, that was all that happened. (suspenseful music) - Then how come he ends up dead, and your clothes are covered in blood? - Dead, what do you mean dead? - Don't play dumb with me. Now, what about Brett Davis? - What about Brett Davis? - You had his ID card in your pocket. - Oh you're fucking crazy. (dramatic music) You think if I had something to hide I'd still be around here? - Better wise up asshole. - Listen shit for brains. (Ted cries out) - [Cop] What did you call me? - If you hit me one more time with that stick, I'm gonna take it and jam up your ass so far, your nose is gonna bleed. (dramatic music) (cop cries out) - Starting to make me mad boy. - Mad? You're fucking nuts. (dramatic music) you want more of this? Tough guy. Okay. (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - You're dead boy. Dead, do you hear me? (suspenseful music) Shit. (suspenseful music) (werewolf growling) (dramatic music) (cop screams) - Hold it right there, police. Alpha Productions gave you the cash to run an expose on this town? - [Ted] Right. - Why would they do that? - Because allegedly, this town contains half of America's most wanted. - And this Brett Davis brought you the cash? - [Ted] He was gonna give me a cheque in LA, I said I wanted cash, so he brought it here. - How come you had his ID? - I didn't, it was planted planted. - Planted, who planted it? - I don't know. - Good old second base? - Third, what's on second? - I've got two, maybe three bodies with your name written all over them. - Hey wait a minute, it was an animal that killed that cop, and it was an animal that killed that dick head the night before. - An animal set you up? - [Ted] Yes, it was mountain lion man. - Whoever it was, they certainly had the power to change form. - That was a joke. - This is no joke. - A bullet, you think you're the lone ranger? - Inspector, can I see you outside for a second please? - What did you tell everyone? - I suggested they go home and you would explain everything to them in the morning. As you might imagine, they're probably quite shaken. - What'd you tell them about Ted? - Only that you were questioning him, nothing specific. - What is it with a bullet? - A werewolf can only be killed by fire or a silver bullet. - My mother told me I'd be punished if I spent my collection money on candy. - Tomorrow night, nothing can stop that beast in there from destroying this town. - Oh yes it can, a nice safe jail. - No inspector, no manmade jail can stop it. Only death can do that. (dramatic music) - You'll be locked in this room until morning. If you try to leave, you'll be shot. - You guys are really serious? You think I'm a killer. - The guard's rifles are loaded with silver bullets. (dramatic music) - Who are you? - [Werewolf] Don't you recognize me Miss? Mary Lou? (Marie screams) (dramatic music) - It's almost dusk. It's pointless to wait any longer. We dare not put this whole town at risk. - John, doesn't it bother you? You being a priest that you could just, you know, kill a man. - He's not a man inspector. He's a beast. It's the most dangerous instrument of Satan that ever existed. - Well, if Ted's the best thing that Satan can dig up we don't have a whole lot to worry about. - And just what are you inferring? - That Ted has got to be the dumbest son of a bitch and werewolf, who ever existed. - [John] That's why he's so clever. - Clever? Since when has shooting yourself in the foot been clever? Why Watson wouldn't have even needed Holmes to work this one out. - We have irrefutable proof, Ted confessed, he is the werewolf. - No, that's not right. The only thing he's confessed to is being in the wrong place at the wrong time. - I was in Hungry, but I didn't kill anyone. I was the one that was nearly killed. I was left for dead. Some villages found me in the snow a couple days later. Then I find out that everyone had died. And that was fine by me. Draco, I've never heard of Draco, and that's the truth. - The truth inspector, Marie Adams told us truth. - How do you know John? - [John] If you didn't. - No, why should you believe Marie Adams and not Ted? In the fantastic story department, Ted doesn't hold a candle to Marie Adams. - I know the truth when I hear it, Marie was God sent. - Well we've hung it on everything else, we might as well have some divine intervention. So what happened this morning? What category does Marie falling off her balcony and breaking her neck fit in? Are you going to cop a plea that it was Satan's revenge, or maybe God was just on a coffee break? - Sir. I never seek to second guessed the ways of the almighty. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. - Oh, that's neat. Well he giveth okay, but he sure lost us up on the taketh. John, when Marie went over the balcony, so did our case against Ted. - Must I remind you it was you who firmly established his guilt? - You work for Alpha Production? - [Ted] Yeah. - Then prove it. - I got a card. No I don't, I left it at the phone box. - Alpha Productions has never heard of you and your supposed agent of Brett Davis? He's a convicted felon. - Ted killed Brett Davis just a surely as he killed your police officer, and the unfortunate parol even the towns people buried. And do you care to know why? - [Kester] Like it would make any difference. - Brett Davis was blackmailing Ted, he threatened to reveal Ted's true identity and demanded 20,000 dollars in return for his silence. Ted handed over the money. Then had second thoughts about Davis's reliability and decided the only way he could trust him was to kill him. - This whole kill Ted thing has been bothering me. And I figured out why. - [John] Go on. - You want Ted dead. Not because you're afraid for the town. But because you're afraid for yourself. You don't want to accept the responsibility for what's happened. - That's ridiculous. - You received a report from the Vatican four years ago and you ignored it. - Do you know how many times I investigate tales and rumors that are designed to discredit the church? - I thought it was a doing a pretty good job of that all by itself. - [John] I'm not going to listen to this. - Yes you are. For this all to make sense, the werewolf has to be in Pioneer town. Now you said before that a werewolf can take over another person's identity and that's what I believe it's done. My bet is that one of the townspeople is the werewolf. The body being discovered was a mistake, but the werewolf turned it to his advantage. All it had to do is play the ace's up its sleeve. Ted was the first ace, he was allowed to escape from the castle, not knowing the fate of the others. Marie Adams was a second ace. She was under the werewolf's mind control. And when he was finished with her, he killed her. - Inspector. - Hear me out. The last ace was you John, a priest with a guilty soul. I'll bet he had fun when he got inside of your head. - That sir, is a gross insult. - Truth hurts. Ted was brought into Pioneer town under the premise of digging up dirt. That's why he was paid the 20,000 dollars. The Catherine Little, who Ted never met but talked to was Marie Adams. Ted never had a chance. He sold himself with the expose money. And then when he wanted out, there was no way. (dramatic music) With Ted now in place, the werewolf used Marie Adams to convince you of something you desperately wanted to believe. That the woman we were after was the wrong person. The werewolf was subtle John. It sicked you after Ted and you didn't disappoint it. Marie's story was like a manna from heaven to you because it lets you off the hook. - And what about you inspector? How do you fit into the plot? - Oh, I wasn't an ace, John, just a face card. An over the hill cop, just hanging out for retirement. - You have presumed much inspector, but there are gaps that need to be filled. For instance, Jaro. - I believe escape was the only way Ted thought he could prove that he wasn't the werewolf. - But you stopped him. Obviously you were convinced. - No, at the time, John, I probably wanted him to be the werewolf as much as you did. - [John] Then how do you explain Jaro's death? - [Kester] After Ted left the room, the werewolf came in and killed Jaro. - For what reason? - To make it personal. Human nature is a funny thing, John. - Listen, someone in this town killed Jaro. It wasn't me. - None of the other victims were directly involved in the town, the beast couldn't take a chance that the town might get cold feet. It had to rile them up. - You know you're just wasting time, just shoot him. - So inspector, how do you expect me to respond to these allegations? And may I say, your character assassination? - [Kester] By helping me find the real werewolf. - You know, I would, if I agreed with your conclusions. (dramatic music) - [Ted] Anyone out there? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - I have something to tell you. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - He jumped me, then he ran away. (door clicks) (wood creaking) (dramatic music) You stay here, I'll warn the town. - Ted, it's okay, you can come down now. There's no one here except me. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) Darn my key, I must have dropped it. - Well what about the front door? - Its locked. Just break in the window. (log thuds) (glass clatters) Shut the drapes, we don't want anyone to see you. Sit down Ted. - How'd you know it wasn't me? You're taking a hell of a risk. - No I didn't. - Well, no one else was convinced. - That's the way I planned it. - [Ted] What do you mean? - You were perfect Ted. I couldn't have made a better choice. - You're the werewolf? - Don't you recognize my voice? You've heard it before, in Budapest. - Mary Lou Sommers. - Right, good guess. - You set this up? - Everything. Brett Davis, Alpha Productions, Draco. I'll take all the credit. - You were Catherine Little. - No, that was Marie Adams. She was very convincing. She had that priest wrapped around a little finger. She could have told him anything and he would have believed her. - Why didn't you kill me in the room? - No, Ted, it was much more convincing. if you turned into the werewolf. You broke into my house and then you attacked me. - What happened to the real Cheryl? - It was a terrible thing. She died in the hospital and she wasn't very happy about it. You've got about an hour Ted. Thought I must say, hiding in the attic was pretty dumb. You probably would have gotten away with it if you'd run into the desert. The priest has the whole town out there looking for you now. - What's going to happen to the town? - You really don't need to worry about that. (suspenseful music) Times up Ted. (gun fires) - Blank, Cheryl. We set you up. Just like you did to us. - We knew Ted had to die before the full moon. The real werewolf couldn't take a chance. I thought it was you, but I couldn't be sure until you rescued Ted. Anyone else would have yelled for help or shot him. - Well, aren't we smart? But do you think you can really kill me with that little gun inspector? (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - Shit. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (audience cheering) - Oh, we thank you so much for this beautiful benefit. Thank all of our neighbors and our friends, and Ted we're sorry.
