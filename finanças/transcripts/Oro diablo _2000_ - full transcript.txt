Grab your 15% and give me my 10 thousand up front, Gallego. Melt mine too. Your share was 10 grams. What's up, Gallego? How're you doin' Fellini? Did you bring me the mercury? Have I ever failed you, Gallego? It's in the truck. By the way, the price has gone up. You're going to have to shell out a bit more gold this time around. You never change. You're gonna be a millionaire. 41 degrees, Fellini, it's sweltering. Unbearable, Gallego. I'm going to get you something that'll make your mouth water. OK. Carmen! Bring Fellini here a nice, cold beer. Fellini! Fellini! What movie are we going to see now? Tonight. -I hope it's one with that mute. -It's a surprise. That mute has a name, his name's Chaplin, right? Yep. -Hi, Fellini. -Hi, mom. -Get out of here. -Mom! Take them with you, Jose Maria gets angry. -Come on, take them with you. -Heck. Come on, let's play outside! I bet he brought one of those we like. I swear I saw it, Gallego, believe it or no, I saw it! Teach, check out this thing here, it's stuck. Give it to me. Fellini! Fellini, what movie are we going to see now? Come on! Fellini, you should come more often. It's so boring here. Do you think that when you make a movie I can have a part in it? Maybe. One like the one you brought the other day. What's up! The one about the dame called Julieta. That one's already finished. Yeah, but in a similar one? Gallego! Let me think about it, OK? Take what I owe you out of this and the rest save it for when I come back. OK. -Hi, love! -Let's go. If it has violence, I'm leaving. We'd have to leave this town, Ana. We always have to wait. Come on now, fix yourself up, someone might come in. So what? They're watching movies. A bit more, love. No, no! Aroldo! Damn it, the movie's here again. I'll give you half, I swear. A miner doesn't steal from another miner. The price you pay for stealing is high. Turn on the lights! Now I'm going for sure! Enough! Already! Enough! Enough! Stop, fuck it! He killed him! He's badly hurt, help me get him away. Stop, enough... Carmen! Come on, careful of the door! Carmen! Come here right away! -Where do we lay him flat? -This way. Careful. -What happened? -Get over here, fuck it! -He's really bleeding a lot. -I'm going to get some towels. This bastard's really hurt bad. We have to take him to El Callao. Chema, go and find Bigotes and have him bring the Jeep around immediately. This is the result of those damned drinking binges. It wasn't a binge, Cheo wanted to knock him down. Isabel, get more towels. This is bad, really bad. -Bigotes isn't around. -And Mooligan? I asked him, he won't lend his pick-up. Fellini, we'll have to take him in your van, he's dying. -Bring it around quickly. -Let's go. Slowly. Be careful. -What do you see in that guy? -In Aroldo? He's not bad and he's going to take us to live in the city. Like before, remember? Everything will be all right. Here, take these and put them there. Someday we'll be rich. What? Do you have it? -Do you have mine? -Here it is. Take it. You can give it back to me when you finish. -Are you crazy? -Shut the fuck up! -What are you doing? -Shut up. Stop it, Aroldo. Please, stop it... You never gave a shit about me. You used me. All you wanted was to steal the gold. You tricked me. I'm out of here! I had nothing to do with this. Let go, Aroldo! Let go of me! Chema, it isn't what you think. I was cleaning. Jose Mari! Let go of me! Chema! Chema, son. Someone help me, please! Carmen! Carmen! Help me, please! What happened? What happened to Chema? -Zuleima, they hurt my boy! -What? Go get Carmen! Get her! Look for Bigotes! Run! Talk to me, Jose Mari. Talk to me, say something! Carmen isn't there. And they stole the gold! I want my daughter. I want you to bring her to me. I want to leave this place with Isabel. We're going to look for her! Sit down, damn it! -Well? -There were problems. What happened? Gallego's son. I had to kill him. That was a serious mistake. Where's your mother? How should I know? She's probably in the hotel. -Come here! -But why? Come here! Let's go, let's go! -What happened to my mother? -Get moving! What happened to her? -That's two grams. -But I pay one-and-a-half. Let's go. They killed Gallego's son. The Savior in His glory will bestow when those who are called join His people and go into His home. I'm sorry, Gallego. The best that I had. This shouldn't have happened. My only son, Mooligan, my son. How much did they steal from you? From me, about 50 grams. No shit. I had asked him to hold on to about 10 grams of mine. We should have sold it to Mooligan. But someone here's going to pay for all that crap. How? If there's no one to pay for the dead kid. And who was it? So? Aren't you scared, girl? And you mother's nowhere to be found. Isn't that strange? My mother is going to come. I doubt it. Even less now that she's rolling in money with all that was stolen and with her lover. My mother's never stolen from anyone. There's always a first time. They took everything we worked for, but you can be damned sure someone's going to pay for this shit. Don't treat her like this. It was her mother. It's not her fault. -Ana, don't meddle. -She's a child. Here's El Dorado and this is the town of Payapal. -Come here, girl, cunt! -Let go of me! -Come here, damn it! -Let go! Let go! She's gonna get screwed good! Let go of me! Get out of here! She's gonna get screwed! Shit, no one kills anyone here! -Tell us where your mother is? -I don't know where she is! -And the gold? Where is it? -I haven't done anything! We obey the law here! -Let's lynch her! -Yeah! No! No! Damn it! No one lynches anyone here! We'll take her there and have at her until the mother comes and pays us! And the gold? I'll take care of it! Fuck! Let's go! -Where's our gold? -Our gold! They're taking her! George, go take a bath now! Mom, leave me alone, I took a bath yesterday! Go take a bath now! There's 15 million here. But I have 5 kilos. Five? Damn, I didn't bring enough for so much, Mooligan. -Wasn't it 3? -Now it's 5. Got a phone? Hello, hello! Yeah, it's me. Look, I need you to send me 10 million more. Well, transfer it to the Bank branch here in El Dorado. Of course now, when the heel do you think? OK then. Quiet babe, the good times are coming. You always with your drugs and shit, you never have time for me. Stop crying, babe. Your make-up's running, what a pain! -Come here! -Leave me alone! I don't like you. I don't want a woman in my bed. I like men. What are they going to do to me? Something you won't like at first This isn't about likes and dislikes, it's about making money. Everything here is money. You're going to stay there until you pay everything you owe. You don't decide. Someone killed the boy? Yeah, it seems it was the girl's mother with a guy named Aroldo. Hey, Selva, move! Do something! Bring the boys here a couple of beers! OK, let's start the bidding. Who's offering? OK. Well then, who's first? I bid 10 thousand. Thirty thousand! Forty-five thousand! Fifty thousand! A hundred thousand! She's yours! Mooligan! And I give my turn at her to my friend here! We shouldn't allow this. Easy, Gallego, easy. Damn! That chick should be mine. They stole the most gold from me! I told you, whoever has the money is in charge here. Easy. Easy. What's the matter? What's the matter? Easy. No! I don't want to! Take that off! I said take that off! -Come here! -No! I don't want to! -She's escaped! -What? -She's escaped! -The little bitch escaped! -Let's go! -Get out of our way! That bitch has got to be around here somewhere. If she isn't in Payapal, she has to be somewhere around here. It shouldn't be too difficult to find her. OK, start it up! Come on, move it! -Well, that do you know? -This I.D. has expired. -Hey, Zuleima! -Hey, love. You haven't seen a chick around here, real cute, young, wearing a pink tee shirt, who ran away from her 'daddy'? -No one like that's been around here. -OK, be on the lookout for her. Let's get moving, that bitch is probably near El Callao by now. Is this his ID? She doesn't have papers. She's the one Zuleima's lookin' for. Take her to the El Callao police station. Just a minute ago, they came by here looking for you. You don't have papers either? You're an illegal? No. Then, why are they after you? To take you for a ride? They're sure to take us back to the city. Me they'll take to Payapal. What's your name? Julieta. Put them in the cell. You come with me. Good morning, Sir, permission to report that this young woman escaped from a miner. Yes, he came by about half-an-hour ago asking about her. Look for him in he bar, he's with Zuleima, the one from Payapal. What is it about that little babe that everyone's so eager to find her? The pest is a little animal that they say is very ugly. For me it's cute... The pest is a little animal that they say is very ugly. The pest is a little animal that they say is very ugly. Shut up! All right, man. I'm sitting down! And what about you there? We come from Payapal. Payapal? We know about an enormous vein of gold. -And if they deport us? -We'll come back. Yeah. You understand now, right? You're not going anywhere until your mother returns all the gold she stole. The gold they stole was for that bull. A big, fat, black guy from Payapal. He owns the town. For who? His name's Mooligan. He's the one that gave the orders to steal the gold. He's the one that always goes around with two bodyguards. There was no one left alive to tell the story, just me. And I'm leaving this hell hole. My pal Aroldo was killed because of that fuckin' situation. Now let the entire world find out, damn it. What was the other thief's name? It was a woman and she was my pal's lover. What's up, chief? Have they finally found the boy? No. Fuck it. That's two this week. He's disappeared but I have three young guys you could use. Where are they from? They're miners from the border and you know they have to be sent back. How much do you want for them, chief? How much are they worth to you? Depends on the "merchandise". It's good quality. -I have to see it. -Let's go take a look. This isn't enough. -These boys are expensive. -I'm giving them to you for nothing. -They're expensive. -Take them or leave them. I can't, it's very heavy. If he can't then he can leave. We're not in the "charity" business. He hasn't eaten anything all day, he's very weak. This isn't a restaurant. Let's go, let's get it to the mill. Get up, we don't have all day. Whoever makes a mistake here is a goner. We were going to be deported. Any way you look at it, we're going to die. I'm going to have lots of money to live well. I heard of someone who found a nugget weighing about 3 kilos and they paid him a bundle. I know for a fact it happened. This area's real good. I'd buy a car or a motorcycle. No shit! I'm getting out of here with a few women. What's wrong with him? Is it drugs? No, he's poisoned. What's wrong with him? It's mercury. This one's done for. Kill him. 1500. -How much did he give you? -1500. -Bastard. -That one's robbing us. -Do you have money in the bodega? -A little. Shit that cock-sucker! What do you want? To go back on the streets? Piroco, pick that up. Grab it! One day I'm going to kill him. A bar of soap. I want those candies. You still owe me 10 thousand. Here's enough to make 2 thousand. You, get over here. Open your mouth! Open! Open! Gold isn't for you. You, you're all alike, a person saves your life, gives you work and you pay them back by stealing. Don't kill him! He might still be useful. I have a sister like you in San Felix who sells lottery tickets with my mother. She was left all alone and I sometimes send her money. It's just that my father abandoned us. We don't talk about it much at home. Why did they name you Atanasia? Well, this guys I fucked told me that it was the name of a Russian princess and that it isn't Atanasia, but Anastasia. And did the guard give you this belt? Yes, each time I fuck I keep something from them. I do it to remind me that I have to get away from this fucking life... Like yours. I'm hungry. If you want to eat you first have to take care of the animals in the bar. Who's he? Some guy that came in and put that photo there. I hate men. I see my father in each miner I sleep with. Let's go. Fino sent me. Well? 100 packets of pasta, 20 cans of tomato sauce and 50 cans of tuna. Is that chocolate? Yes, it's chocolate. I'll take it. Do you want me to put it all in a box? Yes, Fino's in the bar. You can collect there. Everything's ready. Sit down. You're always so warm. Do you remember me? Fino... This is what your boy ordered. I didn't tell you to buy chocolate. Let's go. OK, turn up the music, Mooligan is here. Isabel has paid off more than half the debt. So? Well, she paid Pedro, Juan Tabaco, Guillermo, Polo... And who will give me back my son? This town is going to be mine, slowly but surely. Money buys everything and now you too are mine. One of these days you're going to be very rich. As rich as you? As rich as you. No, there's no one here by the name of Julieta. I'm sure I saw her. She's kind of small. I'm sure I saw her here a few days ago. No, I don't know who you're talking about. That's her. Oh, but that isn't Julieta, that's Isabel. Why did you tell me your name's Julieta? Because I liked that name a lot. And now? Now you don't like it? Yeah, she's one of those actresses that plays in movies, do you know who she is? What would you know. I know a lot of things. Do they pay well? Sometimes, sometimes they give me things I want. Things I never had, I also have to pay off a debt. A debt? Yes, but I don't want to talk about that right now. That's no way to live. It's crap. Well, then you pay me. I don't owe you anything. And if I want to come back? Gallego. Gallego! I'll buy all you have. I'll pay cash. And if I decide to sell to you, how much will you give me? I don't know, how about 20 million? No way! Just the hotel alone is worth 20 million. Come on now, all of that is working at half speed. Only one of your mills is working. Besides, people no longer have confidence, they're afraid. All that's worth anything is the bar and the food store. Anyway, what am I doing here? Of course, if you accept my offer. you can leave, go back to your homeland and forget about this nightmare. What are you doing here? Weren't you up there in the mine? I wanted to see you. Look! -My God, look! -There's so much. And now, everything I earn is mine. I paid what I owed, you know? Gee, Tony, come on, come with me. Gallego! Back again. Take it easy, this town is a great business for you. Yeah, one has to be where the action is, no? You're learning fast, kid. -What's up, Fellini! -Hello. Let me help you, even if it's the last time. I already heard, Gallego. You're coming back with me. All I want to know is what the fuck am I going to do with the mercury you ordered? Don't worry, Mooligan will buy it all. Life goes on, Fellini. I came to the conclusion that the only important thing in my life was my son. and that all the gold here won't bring him back. Leaving already, Gallego. This town has no life. Things are being said around there. Come on, let's get a drink. Come on then. Look at that, 4 guns and ammunition. We'll settle up accounts later. Are they new? Never been shown. As usual. Today I brought "Besame Mucho". It looks like the movies are here again. Damn, now you don't know me? -Let's go, Tony. -I'm staying. Let's go, Tony! I guess you know everything, even that my mother and her lover robbed the people in the town. Aren't you going to ask me what happened? It's easy to see a mile away. Fellini. -Did you bring what I asked for? -Of course, my love. I'm going to... Man, what a bastard you are. -This isn't complete. -It's all there. 10 grams. Give me a bit more. I share with Piroco. I can't, this is Isabel's. Let's go shopping. What do you want to buy? I don't know, something to eat. Let's go then. Well, Gallego, aren't you going to watch the movie? No, Bigotes, I'm not. And weren't you going to use the telephone? Fuck, yes. It's one of Mooligan's buyers. Wants to know what time I'm going to pick him up. Hello! Hello! Of course, who else would it be? I'm the only one with any action here. That's it. Did you bring it? I'm on my way right now, OK. Lift it. To the left. Right there. Leave it there. It's fine there. Bye then. Fellini! What are you doing here? If you want to you can come with me. Come on, you never change. You're always the same. Know what? I think my mom might come back for me some day. This isn't the life for you, Isabel. And this town won't last, come with me. We'll make lots of movies together and you'll be my star in all of them. I want to stay here, Fellini. The people treat me well and I make money. I'm a queen, just like in those movies you make. You don't fool me. I know you. Look, there's no magic in this town, this isn't like in the movies. It'll be different with me. Hey man, you don't change. But you know what? I'd rather watch the movie. Florentina, come! There's a fair tomorrow, but you'll be on your own. And what am I going to do? You're going to go down and buy some dynamite. Have you tunneled with dynamite before? No. You'll go down there with the money and find one of the guards. He'll be waiting for you on the bridge, understand? OK, no more talking about this. I know I'll love you all my life. I'll love you, I'll love you at each goodbye. -Fellini, where are you going? -I'm leaving. But we're having a fair today? That's why. I know what it's like. Florentina, don't wander away, we're going now! Go help Gallego. Have you seen Isabel? I think she's still asleep, she went to bed really late. That one's going to be the owner of Payapal one of these days. Florentina, come here! What can I say, Gallego? I'm taking fond memories of this place with me. I'm moving forward. Some day you'll understand that this had nothing to do with you. I'd like to turn back time and go back to what this was before. Well, here's yours. And you know that you can't forget the timing chain. How much? I don't know, I'm not a miner. I make it run but... OK then, Bigotes, give me something as an advance. I'll give you a bit more, but bring me back tobacco, OK? What do you want me to say? You know very well that I don't like crying. Zuleima, I think that I'm leaving something of mine here. Gallego, just leave already. I'd like for them to leave Isabel alone. She doesn't owe me anything any more, she's paid everything. I want to go in peace. You take it easy, man, I'll take care of it. Well, Fellini, don't be a stranger. Let's go. Go already. Just a moment. That can't go here, put it over there. ♪ Here's my "vallenato", music to dance to, ♪ ♪ from the land of Pedro Castro, international music ♪ ♪ Here's my "vallenato", music to dance to, ♪ ♪ from the land of Pedro Castro, international music ♪♪ Another one brakes off with me. -How's business? -Fucking great! There's enough gold here to even give away! I'll drink to that! This is yours, from the gold from the other day. There she is. Bring her to me. What's up? Leave her alone. What's going on? Get another one. Tonight, she's Mr. Mooligan's. Tell Mooligan it's all right and that it's 100 thousand. To think that if it weren't for me, you'd be dead. Look at my money. Money? This is money. Mom, look what he's doing. -We don't drink. -Fuck it, leave me alone! Where is it? What? What we talked about earlier with Fino, where is it? -Did you bring the money? -Here it is. You know using dynamite is illegal. Are you going to start with this now? -Give me the money. -Give me the dynamite. It's not all there. All right, give him half. There's some missing. Where's the rest? It's all there. -Talk, motherfucker! -That's all the guards gave me. -Did you sell it? -I swear I didn't! Whose name are you going to swear by, asshole? I spent it at the fair! Walk. You two, too. Give me the matches. -Tunnel! -But we've never done that. That's your problem. Help me. Piroco, give me that. No! Give me that! No! Damn it, keep still! I'm not going to give you anything. It's like smoking, just light it and it's ready. Don't do that, fuck! It's like lighting a cigarette, stop worrying. Hell, Piroco, don't you want to come? Of course, I do. Then come on. I can't. Don't do it! Shit! I'm not going to die here like an asshole! Don't do it! Stop! He won't die. That's Piroco's and my destiny: to die here. He won't die, no one else will die here. He isn't going to die! Shit, he isn't going to die! You deserved that, motherfucker. What's wrong? Are you sad? Not anymore. We're all going to die, that's life. I don't want to die. It's no one's fault. People die and that's that. I've seen many die. Besides, I've never had an old friend. They all die before. I don't think my mother reached old age. Did she die? I don't know, she abandoned me. Where is she? She lived with this guy. I think he convinced her to rob Gallego. and I stayed behind to pay the debt. She never stole anything from anyone. But they say that's what happened. When I was in prison in El Callao, a miner told me that there was this guy, Mooligan, in Payapal, who ordered all the miners' gold stolen. killed those who stole it, and took all the gold. What? He killed them? Who told you that? Who told you? His name was Ramon. That can't be! Ramon! And he killed them? He told you he killed them? Are you sure of what you're saying? That's impossible! He killed them! Where's Mooligan? He was the one that robbed us. Where is he? Mooligan stole the gold. He's the one that stole from us. He stole from all of us and killed my mother. Mooligan stole the gold? Mooligan! Where are you, motherfucker? Where's Mooligan? Mooligan come out of there, you motherfucker, come out! Mooligan robbed all of us, he stole the gold and killed my mother! You know where Mooligan is, tell me, God damn it! Grab him! He was the one that killed my mother? Talk! Talk! Wait a minute! What's going on? Let him talk! What happened? Everyone here knows that Mooligan gives the orders and I carry them out. Bring him, come on. Bring him. Let's see what this motherfucker's going to tell us. Get him up! Motherfucker! Get up! Come on, get up! Over there! I didn't thank you. Now, if you want to, you can even call yourself Julieta. Really. No, I don't want to call myself Julieta now. Now they're going to respect us, you'll see. And who's going to respect us here? The jungle, Anastasia? Other miners like you? No, man! That isn't being respected, that's bullshit. Come here. Now we're both free, no one owns us anymore. Neither you nor me, nor Payapal either. And free to do what? We could rule here in Payapal. What? We could own everything, all the mills, the bar, everything! Yes? Of course! Look... Now is when we are really going to be rich. Mr. Carlos Eduardo, alias CAE. The owner of all Payapal. And his inseparable friend, Isabel, the owner of the bar. And money, money... Gold... Everything for us. No. There seems to be a gold run. -Where? -At the Gavilan mill. Sacks are coming out with 7 and 8 grams. -I'm going with them, Zuleima. -Yeah. Well, are you coming with me? Yes, I'm going with you, Fellini. Let's go. What's happening? It looks like there's a gold run. That gold won't be for them. They gave those lands to some foreigners. Shut the fuck up, Fellini. I know very well what I'm saying. Look, the film, the entire movie will be filmed in the city. You're going to be a young lady, full of dreams. It's perfect for you. Believe me, it's going to be a box office hit. I've got it all thought out, all the shots. Isabel! Attention, attention... This land is a concession of the Gold Mine company You must vacate this land within the next 24 hours.
