Next, please. - Next in line, please. - Next! Next, please. - Next. - Next in line, please! Hi, How you doing? - Can I see your documents? - Fine. What's the purpose of your visit to the United States today? Two weeks holiday. Do you have a return-trip ticket? Excuse me. There's no photography in the F.I.S. area. Is he traveling with you? Are you two together? Yes. Sir, why don't you come on up? Join us. - Come on. - Is there a problem? No, there's no problem but if you guys travel together, I want to talk to you together. - Can I see your documents? - Sure. Passport, please. Are you related? Yes. He's my friend. You're a Czech national. You're a Russian national. How do you know one another? We know each other from Prague. How long are you planning to stay? Two weeks. Okay, I'd like him to answer for himself. Yeah, but he doesn't speak English. No, sir. I speak very good English. I'm here for movies. For movies? I don't understand. - When I was a boy... - Uh huh I've seen at my school a movie called "It's Wonderful Life"... directed by Frank Capra. and ever since, I just want to come to United States... land of the free, home of the brave... a country where anyone can be anything. It's bullshit! "Abandoned Baby in Times Square." Come on, it's too fucking soft. It won't work, and it won't get the numbers. What are you suggesting, Robert, that we manufacture bad news? It's what they tune us in for. We're a tabloid show. They tune in for rough stuff. Look. The network's up my pretty little ass to make a change. Every lobbyist, mom, and politician... is screaming about violence in prime time. We've got to broaden the format. Okay, you broaden the format. In the end, the story they will run is the one with the juice. They want ratings as much as I do. If it bleeds, it leads. - What do you got for me? - Ride-along with Eddie Flemming. Fuck, again?! - On the cover of "People" this week. - No, No, Listen to me. He is not new. I love Eddie, he's a dear friend... but we've done him, we've done him to death. I don't know, this is good. This is very good. The psychiatrist is going to trial tomorrow. - And the ratings'll be through the roof. - What's Eddie working on? He's staking out a Jamaican serial killer. Jamaican Serial Killer? That sounds good. I don't want just blood and guts! I want to broaden the format! Listen, Cassandra, I know they brought you in here to raise our standards... to be the journalism cop... - Excuse me! - You're killing my show! Don't forget, Eddie's always good TV. Not when he's drunk. He's got a new cure for that. When? Tomorrow at lunch. Ready, set. Okay Let's go. Thrill of the hunt. Girls, girls, girls! I am the resurrection and the light! Go check it out. Inside. Taxi! Taxi! "Fuji color... "Adjustable shutter speed... "Night vision... "Infrared... "Black and white... "Make your own movies." Damn! Watch where you're going, man! Taxi Where'd that big guy go with the video? He stole my camera! Stop that guy in the cab! - Go! Go! - Stop him! Stop that guy in the cab! Okay, Bryan, we're pulling up now. Listen, this is important. I gotta get some fresh footage for the piece on Eddie tonight. So, you come in fast on my signal with the camera rolling. - You got it? - Got it. So, what's unique? Not what, who. From Jamaica. His girlfriend was taking too long putting her makeup on. They were late for a party. - He stabbed her with a bottle. - Jesus Christ. That's unique, all right. Yeah. Shit. He still went to the party. Top floor, back room. Eddie, autograph, mon. Phone number. Why your picture not on this? - Bounce. - All right. Yo, Unique. Five- O's on the way, bro. Cops? Yeah, mon. - Come on. Let's go. - Love you, too, man. - Who does he think Leon was? - It won't matter. He'll hear the cops are coming and just get out of there. Come on. Be quiet. Right. - Stand by. - Standing by. So, Eddie, are you going to be home tonight? We're running the Stephen Geller piece. You're on it. Again? You ran that fucking thing a thousand times already. So what? He's going to court tomorrow. The psychiatrist's trial is starting. Ratings will be through the roof. Hey, Get out. Get out. Get out. Do me a favor. Cut my interview out. What? What for? Jesus Christ. Are you getting shit from downtown? Fuck 'em. You're the only one making big cases in this town. Yeah, I bring the big cases, that brings the big news. That stuff hurts as much as it helps. Get real jealous downtown. - Stay behind me. - Allright. Hope this fuck don't run. Because my knees are killing me. - Shoo. Be quiet. Get back. - Allright, allright. What? You're worried about my safety? I'm touched. Go! Get away! - Just keep them out of my way. - Right. - You ready? - Yes, Robert, we're ready. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. OK. Let's go. Just get out! Come on, you fucking guys! Come in rolling! It's going down! What's your rush? Going to a party? What you chase me for, huh? What? You always leave your house like that? This not my bloody house! - You live here, or you don't live here? - Me don't live here! Because that sounds like burglary to me, pal. Eddie, any chance we could get that again? Do it again? I didn't want to do it in the first place. Are you fucking kidding me? Turn that fucking thing off! Are you out of your fucking mind?! Jesus Christ, where the hell were you? You two are a waste of my goddamn life! Fuck! No, no, no, Emil. Get the position. What? First scene of my new movie. Collecting our share from the bank job. And... action! Just a moment! It's Emil. Kalinka Kalinka Kalinka, hey! Kalinka Kalinka, Kalinka Hey How are you? Beautiful necklace. Emil, look, it wasn't my fault you two got caught. I know. Please, it's his fault. It's really his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number. How could I wait? Yeah? Let's forget all this shit! Hang on. Calm down. Calm down. You know what? Give me my money. Emil, we spent it. What? Emil, look at the way we live. - I'm a plumber. - Uh huh - You think... - Nice watch. ...I'd be working if I had money? What's going on? Just give me my money. - I'll help you. - You'll help me? Yes. I get you ajob. - A job? - Yeah. The money is good. A job as a plumber? Yes. It's easy. It's good. You think I came to America to work? No way. Emil, we started over. You can, too. Emil, please. I'm your friend, yeah? You know me. I'm your friend. Sorry. It's my fault. Emil. Please. Emil! Emil, put down the knife! You spent all my money while I was in prison? - Now you're telling me to get ajob? - Emil, please. As a plumber fixing fucking toilets?! Please, put down the knife! - You're my friend! - Yes, I am your friend. You're my best friend! Please, put down the knife. Emil, please. Shut up! She saw. What are you looking for? Her wallet, you idiot. Daphne Handlova. Six month visa. Still here after... after two years. She's gonna call the police. She will! She is illegal! Turn that fucking sick thing off! Do as I say! Okay. What are you looking for, eh? What are you looking for? Bohemian barbecue. Yo, man. What you got for me? Gime me something. I don't have time for this tonight, allright. Where the fuck you think you're going? Why do yourself a favour and get the hell outta here, allright. You'll make me bust your ass, right? But I'm not gonna telling you again. This ain't a smart move here, allright? Give me your fucking money... Yo, man... You happy now? Now you're under arrest. Allright. Okay, Okay. - What are you, the cops? - Fire department. Man, Firemen don't carry no damn guns. Oh, yeah? Guess again. I'm an arson investigator. We do everything cops do. Hey, yo, yo, man. Come on! - You got to un- ass me, man. - Allright. We're getting up on three. One, two, three. Look, man. Why don't you let a brother off, man? Come on. No harm, no foul. My bad, dawg. What's up, man? Come on! Put your hand up there. What you gonna do, man? - Where you going? - I'm going to a fire. Oh, Hell, no! I'll send a cop right back! Oh, hell, motherfucker! No, you can't leave me handcuffed to no goddamn tree! Some freak'll come up in here and stab me, man! Make sure EMS is standing by. We'll have to take the bodies out pretty soon. Also, let's get the fourth winches over the front of the building. Chief! Chief, you first due? Yeah. I got two roasts up on the top floor... but you don't have to investigate... because Homicide's here. Homicide? Who the hell said they could go up there? I didn't make this a crime scene yet. Hey, It's Eddie Flemming. Fuck him. Yo, Jordy, where you been, man? We got a celebrity. Yeah, I heard. Who the hell let him up there? I don't know. Think Eddie'll give me his autograph? Yeah, maybe he'll give you a kiss, too. Whoa, shit. - Hey, Cap. - Bobby. How are you doing? Stairs are soggy. - Hey, Eddie. - What? Looks to me, from the sixty- nine position... that they were doing each other. They must've been smoking something and they were so wacked out of their heads that they got careless, lit up the mattress and set themselves on fire. What do you think? I don't know. We got the experts here. Whyn't you show 'em what you found. Hope you don't mind, guys. We thought maybe you needed some help. Not at all. Detective Flemming? - Bobby Korfin. - How you doing, Bobby? My uncle Tony used to work with you back... Detective, do you mind putting that cigar out? - Trying to pick up a scent. - No, no. Sorry. Hey, I'm glad you guys got it all figured out, but, uh... you mind if we go through our routine? - Give us something to do. - Oh, no. We don't mind. No, no, no. Certainly. - Appreciate it. - Be our guest. Thanks. Talk about smoking after sex. We got a fast burning fire. We got some good low patterns down here. Mouth's clean. Clean? So let me get this straight... You guys think that, uh, a couple of crackheads burned themselves up, huh? That's what it looks like to me. What? While they're burning up, they're still going down on one another? Gotta hand it to them. I guess some people have their priorities straight. I guess they do. Flammable. - Thank you. - What's that? Evidence... of a homicide. - You fellas know what that is, right? - No. What is it? Camello, punch a hole in the corner. I want to look at the floor. You got it. See that? No soot in their mouths... which means they weren't breathing before the fire. and this little piece of cloth... means they were doused from a flammable liquid... and then positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident. No offense. What's he looking for? He's looking for a timer. Here you go. Big double homicide. Good. Just take some deep breaths. You see the look on Eddie's face when you handed him that timer? Damn, I wish I had a picture of it. - He knew all along, though. - What? Why do you think he was so quiet? He was testing us. You think so? Detective, does it look like a murder? We haven't determined the exact cause of death yet. There's a lot of answers we still haven't got. - How many victims? - We got two bodies at this point. Have you identified those bodies? No, not positively. Is it drug related? Well, we don't know the cause of the fire. We don't know the cause the deaths. So, when we get them all, we'll let you know. But, we don't know now. What's that you're holding in your hand? Is that evidence? This is something we found on the scene. Whether it's evidence or not has yet to be determined. - Thank you, Detective. - You're welcome. Look over here, Eddie! Come on, one big shot! See ya. - Do you see her? - Who? There was a woman in the crowd. She looked scared. I don't know. Looked like she wanted to talk to us or something. Aw, Shit. Get a blanket. Oh, man. Here you come. Here you come. It's about fucking time. What the hell happened to you? She stripped me, man. A bag lady. Stripped all my clothes off, man. Grabbing me all in my nuts. It was disgusting. You should consider yourself lucky, allright. Because I'm not gonna lock you up. You're free to go. So, you get the hell outta here. A dog pissed on me, man! You violated my civil rights. We got you for robbery one. Let's go! Take a walk! So, before you slept with her... with your own son's wife... did you take even a second to think about the consequences? I take full responsibility for sleeping with daughter in law. I... I had very low self-esteem. And I felt like I had to compete with somebody. It just happened to be my son. You're blaming this all on having low self-esteem? I had... I had a lot of behavioural disorders. A behavioural disorder and low self-esteem... that makes you have sex with your son's, uh, wife? It's not all his fault, though. No, that's true. It isn't all his fault. What about your wife? He's ignored me for months. I had no one around. I didn't think that he loved me anymore. How could somebody who loved somebody do something like that, allright? That's the lowest thing you could ever possibly do to me. "Self-esteem." "Self-esteem." "Low self-esteem." Don't speak to me in Russian. - You got it? - Okay. - Just erase it! - Okay! Daphne Handlova. What's this? "Worldly Escorts." "Worldly." What is it? What is it? - I'm serious. - Get on your knees. Look at, look at me in the eyes and tell me you're sorry. And let me see if I believe you. I'm very sorry for what I've done. I promise. I promise I'll never do it again. How come we don't believe you? - Hi. - Hi. Are you looking for companionship? Yes. I'm homesick. I can set you up with a real fine date. Do you have Eastern European girl, Czech girl? - Of course. - Ask for Russian girl. Whatever you want. As a matter of fact... I have a lovely Czech girl right here. Send her. I take her. What's your address? - Can you forgive him? - C'mon, give me a hug. - Hello. - Wait a minute. Hold on. That's a, that's a start. A good start there. Well, now that you know Eddie, maybe he'll put you... in the next movie they make about him. Yeah, you think so? Yeah. You'll play his wife. What's up, Chief? What the hell is that? What's that you're holding in your hand? Is that evidence? This is something we found on the scene. Whether it's evidence or not, we're not sure. We determine that later. You gave Eddie Flemming the evidence? Who did cause and origin? Come on, Chief. Who do you think did? We did. Then why didn't you talk to the reporter? Because we got more important things to do... like finding out who did it. Oh, really? Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look, the more money I get to pay you guys overtime. Good evening. I'm Robert Hawkins... and this is "Top Story." Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller... who horrified the nation two years ago... when he went beserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr Geller's claim... spoken softly and articulately... is that he is the victim. Hard to believe. Watch. These people died... because of the criminal actions of my psychiatrist. He didn't insist that I stay on my medication. So you feel absolutely no responsibility... for killing these people? It was my finger that pulled the trigger... but morally, I'm not responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How can I know? I'm not a doctor. That seems very savvy for a man who's been found... mentally incompetent to stand trial. Well, look, I'm a victim here, too. My life has been permanently disrupted. Permanently disrupted? Hasn't this "incident," as you call it... jump-started your career as an artist? Isn't there a movie in the works about you? We're in negotiations. That's correct. But doesn't the "Son of Sam" law prohibit convicted criminals... from profiting from their crimes? It doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I wasn't convicted. I was found to be temporarily insane. Coming up after the break... I love America. No one is responsible for what they do. Get in the bathroom. We'll fuck her first. Get in the bathroom. Fuck her first, right? Stay there! Shut up! Right? Hello. Hi. I'm Honey from Worldly Escorts. - You called us? - Yes. And how are you tonight? Where is the Czech girl? Baby, I'm whatever you want me to be. I'm a schoolgirl, I'm Mommy, I'm a Czech girl. Now, I like to get business out of the way... before we get down to pleasure. So can you put the money on the dresser? Yeah, but... I need the Czech girl. Daphne. You know her? It's an outcall service run from a loft. I don't know the other girls. Aren't you getting get undressed? Where's the escort service? That's confidential. Can you put the money on the dresser, please? Yes. - Sure. - Thank you. I'd like to talk with the person who runs the service. Can you give me her address? Look. Do we have a problem here? No. Good. Because there's no reason for us to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good. Sorry, no smoking. When I'm through with you... you won't even remember the Czech girl. Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address, please. Look, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not... but you're paying for my time. Yeah, just listen to me. Just, just give me the address, and then you can go. Ok, just...what? No. God. What are you doing? - Listen to me. You got to help me! - Let go off me! - No. God. - Just calm down and listen to me. Give me the fucking address, and then you go! Please, you got to help me. You got to help me. I need your help! All right! Okay! Okay! It's in my purse. No! Shit! God! No! Help me! No! Help me! No! God! Someone! Please help! No! Help! No! The thing that really stood out about this girl were her eyes. She had the, uh, most amazing huge blue eyes you've ever seen. Just uh,... absolutely beautiful. And how long they been living in your building? - Four years. - Yes, I'll hold. I'll give you a call as soon as we know something more. Yeah. Thank you. - What do you got? - I got Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is. Okay if I smoke? It's your crime scene now. You can do whatever you want. Did you watch the news? Nah, I must have missed it. Well, just so you know... I gave you guys all the credit. Yeah, well, just so you know... I don't really care about that stuff. Well, why should you? I don't even watch TV. Good. Good. That's commendable. So, you get a report from the M.E.? Sure did. I want to ask you something. You got a problem with me? Look. If you showed up and found me... stepping on your crime scene... and remember, it was my crime scene yesterday... it might piss you off, too. So, what about the report? You were right. They were both dead before the fire. The man was stabbed so hard... the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. And that usually indicates something pretty personal. Super said he's seen her before, but... she didn't live here. Prettiest suspect I've had in a while. Look. I don't even know if she has anything to do with this. I saw... I saw her outside after the fire... and thought maybe it was a lead. I thought maybe she saw something. That's all. Why would they have taken the trouble... to position the bodies like that? Maybe they're trying to send somebody a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. How do you know all this? My folks were from Poland. Yeah. Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh, huh, really? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. There was another murder on... 8th Avenue in a hotel. A stabbing. Clerk said a Russian rented the room. Do you mind if I go along with you? Well, this isn't a fire. You know, there's nothing for you to do. You know what Eddie. I'll watch you. Maybe I'll learn something. This isn't homicide school, kid. You know? But if you want to help, take that. What's this? The matching set for the murder weapon. This is our second day in America. First day was very exciting... full of thrills and chills. Over here... is the co-star of my new movie. Yeah. My partner Emil. Who's this? That is New York's finest. Yeah. That's his case. Is that all you want? Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? It says in there he wants a million. - A million? - Yeah. - You're kidding, off course. - No. The killer gets million dollars for television interview? Yeah. It pays to be a killer in this country. - Hey. - Hey. Just taking a bath. - Any ID? - No. - P.D. only. - No, he's Okay. We still got to run some prints. This, uh, kid here from Midtown caught the case. How you doing? - Tommy Cullen. - Hiya, son. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. This is what we got. Figure it'd a prostitute. Judging from the defence wounds on her arms and hands... she was really fighting for her life. The room was registered to a Frank Capra. Capra? who said this guy's Russian? The clerk. Check the switchboard. Let's see what calls came from this room. I'm on it. Excuse me, gentlemen. We're waiting on the M.E. to find out if she was raped. You know, we got a shitload of prints here... but in this joint, they could be anybody's. Anybody take a piss lately? Check the toilet seat. Only one guy checked in? Yeah. Come here, you want to go to homicide school? Let me show you something. The killer was standing over there, slashing her. At the point of death, the heart stops beating... so you don't bleed anymore. Do you see these two marks over here? Somebody else was standing over here... while the killer was stabbing her. - Murph! - Yeah. What kind of knife you think we're talking about here? Well... If you look at the marks on the wall over here... These marks, they're wide, but not very deep. This is not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife. What if the tip was broken off? That could be. Then we'd probably find it somewhere. I think we already found it. Okay. There was only one phone call made from this room last night. I dialed it, and it was an escort service. You identify yourself? Hey, I'm maybe new, I'm not stupid. Call communications. Let's get an address on that number. Good work. Thanks. So you gonna head over to the escort service? I'll let you know what happens. Hey, Eddie, you the man, bro! Come on, Eddie. This is ridiculous. If I ride along with you, At least we could talk over the case. Allright, I tell you what. I'm gonna bounce this coin. If you win, you come with me. If you don't win, you don't come with me, allright? Fair enough? All right. All right, but I call it. You call it. One... Two... Three... - Tails. - Heads. You lose. Come on, come on. That's bullshit. I didn't get to see. Go ahead. I'll call it. Heads. See? You lost twice. See you around. Come on. - Yeah? - Come on. All right. That supposed to be funny? Yeah, come on. Come on! I was just joking. Thanks for letting me come along. No problem. Souvenir. Two heads. Yeah, who's there? Better than one. Police. We just want to ask you some questions. Do you have a warrant? We're not looking to bust you, ma'am. Just, What do you want? It's Detective Eddie Flemming from Homicide. We just, Just open the door. We want to talk. Oh, my God, what an honour. Rose Hearn. Please, come in. I just, uh, I just saw you on television. - You look better in real life. - Thank you. Just give me one second. So, uh, what can I help you with, Detective? We don't have any ID yet... but I think we found one of your girls murder last night... at the King Edward Hotel. What? Did you send anybody over there? Yeah. Honey. Yeah. She's one of my girls. She's dead? I'm afraid so. Oh, my God. Are you all right? Yeah. - Do you want some water or something? - Please. Get some water, please. Do you know what she was doing there? She, uh, she was on a date... with a guy who called asking for a Czechoslovakian girl. I sent him Honey. Because, you know, once they get there, it doesn't really matter. Do you have Czech girls working for you? No, uhm.. but he insisted on one. Does this girl look familiar to you? - Linda? - Hmm? What was that? What were you saying? I think I know this girl. Her name is Daphne. She's a Czech girl. I tried to recruit her and... I gave her my card. I just never heard back from her. She's very popular all of a sudden. Do you have a last name? I don't know. I, I just had two guys come in here a second ago... asking about her. Who were they? The one guy said he was her cousin and, uh, he was trying to find her. They had a video camera, and he was taping... and I just wanted them to get out of here... so I told them where she worked. Where's that? It's a salon on 63rd and Madison. 63rd and Madison? What's the name? Ludwig's. She works there. She washes hair. Leon, meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair Salon. Suspects might be there. Yeah. We think the suspects are gonna be there. - Right away! Right away! - Hurry! Want a sip? - I'm on duty. - So am I. Hunting for Daphne. I'll go inside. You cover the exit. Of course. Hey! I always wanted to be a cop, you know, when I was a kid. I dreamed about pulling out my gun running up to a door... kicking in and yelling "Freeze!" at bad guy. What did you dream about? You know, running up to a burning building, and kicking down the door... rushing through the smoke, and saving a kid. Well, then I guess we're doing it the right way, aren't we? If we pulled up to a burning building, I'd gladly let you go first. Watch out. Fuck. The thrill of the hunt. Excuse me. - Yeah? - Uh, sorry. I'm looking for Daphne. Oww... I don't know where she... But maybe in front. Thanks. I've got a temper. When I lose it, I lose control. Get out of here! I didn't intend to kill Milos. When I went to prison, they beat me. I still didn't tell he was my partner. I loved Milos like a brother. Daphne, will you be coming back to work? - In a minute, Ludwig. - Yeah. Come! Thank you. I don't want to kill you. But if you talk... I will. I thought... you'd want it. This was Tamina's necklace. Keep it. Let's get out of here. Goodbye, my love. Your name's Daphne, right? Remember last night at the fire, you saw me? No. Last night at the fire, well, you trying to tell me something. I got it. I got it. I smell smoke across the street. We just want to talk to you. We're here to protect you. No problem. You speak English? Huh? You speak English, don't you? Yes. Okay, let's go this way. Did two guys come and visit you today, huh? What's that? Who gave you this? Across the street, two guys with a video camera. Don't look! Don't look! It's okay. It's okay. Let's just box them in, okay? You stay here with her. Come on, let's go! Shit! Go! Goddamn! Split up! Fuck! Go! Son of a bitch! Get the fuck out of the road! Move! Damn! On the bus! - Look out! - Be careful! Excuse me! Move! I'm a cop! Look, look! Watch out! Watch out! - Perfect! Cut! Print! - Go! Bobby, you OK? Yeah, I'm all right. They went towards the park! Towards the park! - You hit? You hit? - No. He's got my piece. He's got my piece! - Let's get out of here. - I don't believe this. Did you get him? I think so. I'm here, Leon. I'm here. I'm having a bad day, man. You'll be okay. You're okay. ...armed and dangerous. We've surrounded the park. They've disappeared. ...to parts unknown within Central Park. Detective, can you tell us what happened? I can't talk right now. We've got too much to take care of. Hey, Come on, Johnny. Give me a break. Excuse me, what's the Fire Marshal doing here? How's the fire department involve? I can't give out any statements right now at this point. I'm sorry. I understand your partner, Leon Jackson, is injured. Is that correct? He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine. Do you have a suspect in custody? Now's not a good time, Okay? Detective Jackson was not hurt seriously. That's all I can tell you. All right. All right. Hey! Eddie, are you all right? Not a good time, right? - All right. - Right? All right. If you'd just be willing to cooperate... Let me tell you something. I want to know who these guys are... and I want to know how you're involved... and I want to know now! I don't know them. I don't know who they are. I've never seen them before. I was there showering, and Tamina is a friend of mine. My shower was broken, so she let me use theirs. Yeah, go on. That's it. I saw the killings. And I... - I don't know why. I was scared. - Then why are you protecting them? I'm not protecting them. I'm protecting myself. - From what? - I'd... Are you here illegally? 'Cause you don't have to worry about that. We'll talk to immigration. - They're gonna deport you. - Don't talk to immigration. Why not? You better tell us because we gonna find out one way or another. Better that it comes from you. You understand? Okay. Let's make some room. Bring him in. You want to sit down? Why don't you sit down? You want a glass of water? My little sister and I shared a flat. And I came home one night, and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair, and I grabbed it... and when he came at me, I shot him. Justifiable homicide. Yes, but... he was a cop. So you shot him, and you killed a cop? You know, I... I was living in a small town in Slovakia. We don't want to hear your life story. I got an officer shot out there. Just tell us where we can find these guys. You're a cop. I know you won't help me. You're right. I'm not gonna help you, unless you help us. Hey, Eddie,... can I talk to you alone for a second? For a second. Even if she is telling the truth, she's fucked. Well, look, would you mind let me talk to her first? All right, any leads I get, they're all yours, but, you know... let me get first crack at her. You want to talk to her alone? Look, you can tell this girl is scare. You obviously intimidating her and you're a big hot shot celebrity. I'm a nobody, you know. And maybe she'll open up with me... and maybe, maybe she looks at me different. So, what is this? You're gonna be her savior? Just a girl you gonna save from the burning building? Come on. I'm being serious here. Okay. I'll give you a head start... but you get her to the station house... and don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. Come on. I'm a professional, all right? Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. What are you doing? I've got to light this scene better. Make it more dramatic... just like in the movie,... "Silence of the Sheeps." Shut up. It hurts, huh? Big enough? Just kidding. Want to get married? I love you. You want to get married? Sweetheart. No? Come on. Come on. Okay. She's here. She's here? What does that mean? "Good luck" in Greek. Hey. Good luck in English. Are you married? No. Do you live alone? I haven't showered since the killings. Maybe we could stop at your place, and I could take a shower... before we have to go back to custody. Look, , uh,... I can't take you back to my place. Then somewhere else? How's it going there, dude? - Eddie, how are you? - Not too good. Eddie! Hi You have a funny way of showing it. Yeah, me, too. Why'd you snap at me? - I didn't snap at you. - Yes, you did. I just wanted a statement. I just can't answer every time you want an answer. I couldn't do it. Okay. You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could have said something. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of your colleagues. - You know that. - It's all right. - You okay? - Hmmh. Hey, you got blood all over your watch. - Was it Leon's? - Yeah, probably. It has to be. Is he gonna be all right? Yeah, he'll be okay. Last week, you had that schoolteacher's blood on your shoes. I don't know how you do it. Speaking of shoes... you know what I was thinking? I'm a... You know, I, I I would like to have a... some shoes next to my shoes. Wait. What are you doing, Eddie? Forget the phone. What are you... No, go ahead. Answer the phone. Aw, shit. - Yeah. - Nicky, it's me. Look, Look. Can I just call you right back? No. No. No. You can't call me back. We can't find Katie. We want you to anchor right now. We don't know where she is. Come down, get in a cab, and be here in an hour. Wait a minute. Now? Now, right now? Hey, you want your shot? Get in the cab and come down here now. Oh, okay. They want me to anchor. - Great. - Tonight. Great, great. Oh, my God. Uhm... Okay... Forget that for a second. No, when you come back. When you come back. You promise? We'll talk tonight? Of course I promise. I'll see you when you come back and we'll do it. Go ahead. You're gonna be great. I love you, Eddie. I love you, sweetheart. - I'll see you tonight. - See you tonight. - Okay. - Yeah. Good luck. Don't be late. The video of Milos and Tamina... I told you to erase it. I erased everything. It's all gone. Don't lie. I won't be angry. Why not? - What is it? - What does it look like? It's an address book. I took it from the black cop. What's this? What is it? "Eddie Flemming." Why won't you be angry at me for keeping my movie? You'll see. Come. Bring the camera. Hello. My name is, uh, Frank Capra. I'm a famous Hollywood director. There she is! Hey, hey. Warsaw! Hey, Chief. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I came to see how the investigation is going. You know, I called, and you're not here. I waited by the station house, you never show up. I beep you, you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been? Look, Ladder 21 was at the rock for training. All right? So we stopped there so she could get cleaned up. What do you mean cleaned up? I let her take a shower. A shower? And did you take one, too? Come on, Chief. She's been through a lot. I'm trying to help her out. Oh, really? That's really nice of you. You take a homicide witness... to take a shower after your partner's been shot. Are you out of your fucking mind? You having that much trouble getting dates or what? I told him to take her there. Tommy, get her out of here. There was the press all over the place. I didn't want her face in the news,... so I told him to take her some place quiet untill things calmed down. - Oh, really? - It was my decision, it wasn't his. Well, you see, I am the Deputy Chief Fire Marshal... and every now and then, I like to be included in decisions. I understand. In fact, once he briefs me... you guys can take over the press conference... and you can take the lead in the case. How's that? Yeah, All right. I'm ready to be briefed. - Okay? - Yeah. - Excuse us. - Yeah, Sure. Are you ready to brief me? - Yeah. - Good. - Eddie, I... - Wait. Hey, fellas, can you just give us a few minutes, please? - You bet. - Thanks. Shut that door, too, when you go out. Thanks a lot, guys. Okay, just so you know, I didn't touch her. Maybe you should've because nobody gonna believes you didn't,... including me. I know it wasn't the smartest thing to do... and I think I'm a fool,... but I swear to you nothing happened. No, it wasn't the smartest thing to do. To say the least, you ought to know better. She's got the potential to fucking hang you, you know that? If she even suggests that you made a pass at her... it's fucking over. You can deny it all you want. It won't make a fucking bit of difference. Come on, you never went out on a limb for somebody? - You never took a chance on somebody? - Know how you go out on a limb? You say "Here's the name and address of an immigration lawyer." That's how you go out on a limb. You heard her story, you believe her, too. You'll jeopardize your career... and you're gonna jeopardize your life, and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And I'm gonna give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV... but I'll let you in on a little secret. The whole fucking world watches television. And when you go out there, they know your face... and the little bit of fame, a little fucking itty bitty of fame, that I have in this fucking city... makes my job a lot easier... and I get a lot more done because of it. So, why'd you stand up for me with the chief? I don't know. You remind me of a puppy I used to have... He used to pissed all over the carpet, but I still kept him. - Let's go. - Captain! One at a time, please! We're looking for two male white suspects in their thirties. We believe them to be of an Eastern-European nationality. That's another lesson. You got nothing to say, don't waste their time or yours. Let somebody else do that. What's the plan now? You're on the team, so I'll call you when something happens. Right now I've got to propose to my girlfriend. Really? Congratulations. Yeah, don't congratulate me. She hasn't said yes yet. Well, look. I still think there's something I could be doing... in the meantime to help find these guys. Go home and get some rest. Sometimes you can try too hard. Sometimes you have to go away in order to come back. Kinda like you did with that shot today? That's right. All right. I get it. Good,... because you don't look like you get it. I get it. - Sure you get it? - I get it. - You get it? - No, I get it. Trust me. I get it. Why don't you keep it? Don't say I never gave you anything. ♪ Never knew quite what I had ♪ ♪ Little darlin' if you hear me now ♪ ♪ I never needed you so bad ♪ ♪ Spin around inside my head ♪ ♪ Sail away with me honey ♪ ♪ I put my heart in your hands ♪ ♪ Sail away with me honey ♪ Coming. ♪ Sail away with me ♪ ♪ What will be will be ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you now, ♪ ♪ now, now ♪ Nick? Hello? I'm looking for Gayle Cassiopi? - Cassiopi? - Cassiopi. I think it's one flight up. Thanks. Action! Who's she? None of your fucking business. Who's Nicky? Beautiful. It's okay. You know what I need? I need your opinion. You do, huh? About what? You see... they're going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie... and write books. Write books. And write books? What's your fucking accomplishment? I kill someone famous. And I saw you... on the page of "People" magazine. Eddie, look at me. Good. Good. Good. Be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want you to die like a hero. Tabloids don't have to do re-enactments. They're going to have a real movie this time. You film killing me, you'll get away with that? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Then you're stupider than I thought. You're both out of your fucking minds. Turn it off! Turn it off! No! We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their crimes? So I kill you, and if we are caught... we are sent to mental hospital... but once I'm in the hospital, I say... I'm not crazy... just pretending. So I would be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane... and because of your double jeopardy law... we can't be tried for the same crime twice. We come out free, rich, and famous. This is a great idea. This is a fucking great idea, man. You think the jury's gonna buy that bullshit? You sick fucks. I'm smarter than Americans. You watch cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. So... Detective Eddie Flemming... Would you like to say good-bye... to your Nicky? Maybe you can propose to her now. Okay. He has nothing to say. Give me a pillow. Give me a fucking pillow! Come here, start the camera. Cut! This is my project. I'm the director, and I say action. Shut the fuck up! Detective Flemming was one of the most decorated NYPD detectives in the history of New York. Among the several thousand arrests he made during his career, the famed Stephen Geller case. He was widely loved by the community he served. His partner eulogized him. Eddie was my mentor... My partner... Tragedy. Every great film must have one. ...the word "friend." I will miss him. Hey, I said, no! No! No means no. What? Do you want me to get ugly? Gentlemen, I'm sorry. It's a private affair. - Sorry, no. - Just let me get a drink. Please hold. Just stay on. Hold on. Robert, you've got a call. - What the hell are you doing here? - No, no, hold on. I'm right here. Just stay right there. Robert! Don't be ridiculous. Can't you see I'm busy here? Trust me. You want to take this call. I'll tell you what. Hang up the phone, go get yourself a drink. Take it. Take the call. Take it. Give it to me. I'm sorry. Hello? Who is this? I made a movie of Eddie Flemming's murder. How do I know this is you? You'll know when you meet me. Where? Come to 35th and Broadway. Don't bring the police. Come alone... or you'll be in my next film. Listen, asshole, I've been threatened by better than you. No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you. You know what. They're gonna get you. We're gonna talk about that. What about? Surrendering? Four o'clock. It gives you time to go to bank. One million dollars. Hey "Top Story," are you still there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Look, it doesn't work that way. If you don't want my film... I'll call another show, and they will show it. All right, I'll meet you. I need two things from you. I want exclusivity, and you will surrender to me. Bring cash. Let's go. Truck 21 spotted on the north end of the building... put the aerial ladder up to the roof. Engine company 54 and Engine 9... took hand lines up to the second level. The truckies cut a hole in the roof directly over the fire... So how was the funeral? Not good. Did the D.A. video-tape her deposition? Yeah, she finished a little while ago. Jordy, swing by her apartment... pick up her clothes, and take her straight to INS. She's their problem now. Okay, chief. Hard to believe. Watch. What's this? I don't know. "Good luck with all your troubles. "I'm here if you need me. Ludwig." Who's he? My boss. Why? Are you jealous? Why don't we get your stuff? Look. You're a witness to a double homicide. All right? I can't get involved with you. All right? So, why don't you go get your bags, and... and I'll wait here. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Get back! No! That's not mine! Get back! No! Don't do it! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! - It's locked. - Where's the key? It's not mine, I... All right, get in the bathroom. Get in the bathroom! 10-75! 10-75! 47th and 8th! All right. We're trapped! Two alarms on arrival! Oh, my God. He's nailed it down. Baby, don't open the window. It'll suck the fire towards us. They were here. Jesus Christ, that's Eddie's. They were here! Calm down, Daphne. Just get in the tub. Get in the tub and calm down! - There's gasoline. - What? There's gasoline in here. - What are you doing? - I'm pouring it out. - No, it's not going down. - Oh, my God. Give it to me. Jesus Christ. It's clogged. Goddamn it! Please do something. We're going to die. Forget it. Forget it. They're all clogged. Come on, baby. Just stay low and stay calm. Just stay low! 90% people who die in a fire die from eating smoke. Let me introduce you... to my partner... and the man who started the fire. Emil. Emil, say something for your fans, huh. Emil. Stand back and get down! Just get back and stay low. Stay low! This'll buy us some time! Get back! This is a great film. We can see fire right now, and Daphne's in the fire. Tell him it's okay. Tell him it's okay. Come on. We gotta go! Allright. Allright. Move it, guys. Let's go. Get that plug now! Take care of the boy. And get her some oxygen! - You all right? - What the hell happened... What the hell happened up there? It was a setup. That was a setup. Somebody booby-trapped the apartment. Who booby trapped it? It's gotta be the same guys. You gotta speak louder. I can't hear you. Jordy, are you hurt? Are you all right? I'm all right. What? I can't... No, you have to speak up. What the hell are you talking about? What is it? What is it? We have a disturbance in the lobby. - Where's Hawkins? - He's not on the premises. For the third time, go get that tape and bring it here right now. Any request for that video tape has to go to Bruce Cutler... Woman, I am begging you! You can't let this happen! You want that tape, contact the attorney. I'll be happy to give you... You think we're joking? Listen, you can't do this! Don't do this to Eddie. Don't do it to the people of this city. You can't show the man's murder on TV! You want the tape? There it is! Stay tuned for a special edition of "Top Story." Detective Eddie Flemming's brutal murder... has been video-taped, and we will broadcast it... after these messages. Hard to believe. Watch. Who says you can't be success in America? I came here with nothing, knowing nobody, and now, look. I am success story. Emil. Why did you say "I"? I mean it should be "we." Don't be paranoid. I gave you half of what they gave me. Good evening. I'm Robert Hawkins... - and this is "Top Story." - Here we are. Tonight I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature... never before seen on television... and I do so with a heavy heart. It would only be normal to ask why. Why are we showing something so disturbing? And my answer is as a journalist... I am obligated to show it. I air this tape in loving memory... of my friend Eddie Flemming. Hard to believe. Watch. You film killing me, you're gonna get away with that? Turn it off! Just turn it off! Cut! This is my project. I'm the director, and I say action. Shut the [beep] up! Why did you leave that stuff in about you being a director? Because I am the director. What? Don't you fucking realize if it wasn't for me... for my idea, no fucking a way we'd be sitting here right now? Your idea? My idea. Is that the guy? Don't you understand? This is a great American movie. And who made it? I made it. I made it all. - I was the director. - Who are you? Everything. I am everything. This is what America wants. Violence and sex. Before we hand in the next video... I'm gonna put titles on it... and my credit is going to read, "Directed by Oleg Razgul." Yeah, but there is only one problem. One credit, but I don't share credit. - You got it? - Share credit? You think you're a director? You're just a little, small, Russian piece of shit. Let's go! This is Robert Hawkins for "Top Story." We'll be back after this. All right, all right. I'm here. Oh, Jesus. This is the man I told you about. This is Bruce Cutler. Oh. Hi. Bryan, come get this from here. I am Emil. - I'm insane. - Bruce. Are you my lawyer? Not just yet. I got your money. Okay. Where is it? Shit. Where is it? Where is it?! He's got the camera! He's got the movie! Let's sit down and talk a minute. I need it! - Where is it? - Don't move! Don't move! Get your hands up and drop the gun! Drop the goddamn gun! What did you hit him for? He surrendered! - Go tight on them. - He's unarmed and he's hurt! Emil, I'm going with you. Come on! Come on! I'm going with you. I'm coming down there with you. - I'm his lawyer... - Turn the camera off! Keep rolling! Keep filming! Keep filming! I'm invoking his rights! What's going on? I'm going with you, Emil. Fuck! Emil, I'm going down there with you. What's going on?! - I'm going down there with you. - What's going on?! They're taking you downtown. - Emil, I'm going with you. - Whoa, whoa. - Whoa! I'll take him. - No, he's mine! I'm taking him. Don't argue with me. - He's my collar! - He killed my partner! I'm taking him to the station. After he's booked, he's yours, but I'm walking him in! All right, kid, you're gonna have your 15 minutes. Come on Tommy. You ride with him. - I've got him, I got him. - Get in the fucking car. Emil, I'm going with you. Don't speak to him! Put your head in! Get him in the car, Tommy! Put your head in, you fool! I ain't playing with you! Shit! And you! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Bullshit, Leon! Ashamed of what? I got him off the streets. Because of me that son of bitch... Bravo, Mr Hawkins! Back off, Hawkins. - You better back off. - You're sick, man. You are sick! I'm fed up with your bullshit! That is crap, and you know it! Leon, let him go! Get outta here! Hey, Jordy! Where are you going? You're gonna lose everybody! What are you doing, man? This is not the way to the station! Jordy, talk to me! You're losing them! Come on. Answer me, man! - Answer me! - Where am I? - Jordy, what, what the hell... - What's going on? - Jordy... - What's going on?! - Hold on. Hold on. - What's going on? Hold on. Wait! Wait! Jordy! Wait! Hey, Jordy, hold on! Where's my lawyer? Where are they? Jordy! God damn it! What is wrong with you, man? Shit! Fuck you! What's going on? Jordy, listen! Wait a minute! Jordy, listen! Jordy, you can't do this, man! Listen! Wait, Jordy! Come on. Jordy, listen, man, please! Jordy! How'd you know how to rig that apartment? How'd you know how to rig that apartment? My father was a fireman. He taught me about fire. Now it's my friend. - Tommy, take a walk. - Jordy, you're not thinking straight. Don't you get it? He knew he'd get caught. That's why you video-taped Eddie's murder, right?! Look. I want to see this son of a bitch dead, too. It's over tonight, you son of a bitch! Jordy, you can't kill him in cold blood! Tommy, get the hell outta here! Get in the car and get the hell outta here! Jordy, listen to me! I'm not gonna let you do this! Tommy, get in the car and go! Now go! Fuck it, man! Shit! Something funny? Something fucking funny? Refreshing. You think this is funny?! Turn around! You want to be famous? You want headlines? Now's your chance. Put your hands up. Get your goddamn hands up! Turn around. You want to be a real American, right? You want to be a tough guy? Here's Eddie's gun. You remember him? Come on. You want to be famous? Shoot me. You want headlines? You want to make money? You want to be a celebrity? Shoot me! You can't kill me. You're not a cop. You're just a fireman with a gun. Okay... I'll make it easy. You Americans are pussies... without your missiles and money. You won't kill me. You don't have the balls. Don't do it, brother! Kill me. Hey, Tommy! Get up! You are mine now, sucker! You are mine. You are out of control, you know that? Here's Eddie's gun. Where you going? I lost my shoe. I want my shoe. Get him out of here! Emil Slovak is a victim here. He is not a culprit. We all appreciate the tragedy... of the death of Detective Flemming. I represent Mr. Slovak. He was operating under the undue influence of his partner. This will all come out at the trial... and Emil will be vindicated. I will seek to that. - Good job. - Thanks. How you feeling? I brought letters. Fan mail from women. One wants to buy you a suit... another one sent money, and another one wants money. - Did you bring me the cigarettes? - I did. The perception out there is very bad, Emil, right now. And perception is reality. You may not be crazy... but I want to get that message out... and I want to get it out now. That's our only defence in this case. You have to focus on three things... paranoia, fear, and delusions. I was all of those. But you never appreciated the severity of it until now. Of course not. How could I be? I was paranoid, fearful, and deluded. Now... what about Oleg? They're looking all over for him. They haven't found him. Maybe he went back to Russia. I don't know. No, he's here. Let's forget about him and focus on you. You're what's most important. Okay. What about my movie rights? Book rights? For you? I have not thought about that, Emil. How much do you want? What's your cut? I would think we could be partners. 50-50. No. No way. I give you 30%, no more. Don't forget. We're in it together. I thought 40% might be all right. Oh, my God! No! Thirty, or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Say yes or no. I can live with 30%, but, Emil, it's important you understand this is not all about money. Okay. What else do you need? I need to know about you, what makes you tick. I need to know about your background. I need to know about your mother, your father... your brother, your sister, everything. That's what I need to know. Okay. My father always degraded me. He killed my self-esteem. He hated me from the day when I was born. Emil Slovak will appear in court today. His lawyer... Stay focused. Start again. Emil Slovak will appear in court today. His lawyer will argue that his client is mentally unfit... This is such bullshit. On in a related matter, Mr. Slovak's attorney Bruce Cutler... famous for handling sensational cases... claims his client is unfit to stand trial. Hey, Bobby, want to give me a break already? Hold on. Hello? No, not you, hon. Hello! No, we have no comment. ...his partner Oleg Razgul, who threatened to kill him... if he didn't follow his orders. I gotta go! I'm going back to the Czech Republic... to face the charges against me. I'm innocent. If she shot a cop who raped her sister... in this country, she would be a hero. And I approached him and asked him... for some spare change. Politely, right? Whereupon he pulls out his big gun... pushed me all up in the tree, you know, hand cuffs me like this up here... and then he takes my money, right? Took my money... and left me here like this exposed to all the elements. Un-fucking-believable. Can...can I just say more? Look at this fucking guy. Kids, you know, if you out there... don't hate your firemen. Not all Fire Marshals like this. It's not like this. So, keep the love. Hard to believe. You're watching "Top Story." How could you forget that you hand cuffed a civilian... to a fucking tree in Central Park... in the middle of the night?! Tell me that! Chief, look, all right, I know I screwed up... but it's not like this guy is just some innocent civilian. Well, this guy gonna end your career and probably mine! What are you talking about end my career? What do you mean what am I talking about? The presses gonna be all over us! Get the fuck back to your desks! Come on, Chief. I mean, look at my file. I've never had a civilian complaint against me before. I cracked a lot of big cases. It doesn't matter. Your record doesn't matter! - It should mean something! - No, it doesn't That's past history! Don't you get it? Look, Jordy. I'm sorry. It's unfortunate... that I have to make decisions based on your press coverage... but that's what I gotta do. You're suspended, without pay, pending a department trial. Not to mention your criminal charges. That's not right. You just better get yourself a damn good lawyer. I'm tellin' ya. ...over a million dollars for the disputed video. In related news, Emil Slovak is back in court tomorrow... where we're expected to learn... if he is competent to stand trial. Meanwhile, the massive manhunt continues for Oleg Razgul... the alleged mastermind behind the murder... of New York City Detective Eddie Flemming. "Action News" has learned that Mr. Slovak... won't have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defence. He has received movie offers... and has been in conversations with numerous publishers... concerning the rights to his story. Further developments are expected today... in the bizarre Eddie Flemming murder case. Judge Stanley Stern will issue his ruling... on alleged killer Emil Slovak's insanity plea. If the court rules in his favour today... Mr. Slovak will then be transferred to the psych ward... at Rikers lsland for further testing... before being remanded to the custody... of a permanent institution for the mentally ill. Slovak's attorney Bruce Cutler has maintained... that an abusive childhood is to blame... for the actions of his client. The Czech national apparently has a history... of physical and emotional trauma... heaped upon him by an alcoholic father. What's ever left over, keep it. Thanks, buddy. Jordy. Allright, all right. Keep the Statue of Liberty in the background, all right? How do I look? You look beautiful. Oh, thanks. Fuck you. Roll. What? What are you looking at? Forget about him. Come on. Let's go. All right. All right. Just roll. All right. Let's go. Bruce Cutler, do you have a statement for us? It's been a difficult and long day for us. Emil has been found incompetent to stand trial... and in times of extreme stress... as a result of his delusional thinking... he could not appreciate the wrong fulness of his acts... and therefore he's not liable for his acts. This is a victory for the mentally ill... and before Emil is taken on the boat... to the psychiatric ward at Rikers lsland... it should be noted that what he did... he was forced to do... by Oleg Razgul, a dangerous and demented individual... who is at liberty right now... in the streets of New York, and both Emil and I... look forward to when he is brought to justice. What the fuck are you looking at, you piece of shit? Officers, you have to watch him. He's assaulted my client in the past. That's it? This scumbag kills Eddie Flemming... and now he gets to spend the rest of his life... in some country club nuthouse? What about the victims, what about the families, what about their rights? Marshal, I understand you don't agree... but this is the system, and this is the law. Let's go. I can kill you. I'm insane. All right, all. We need this area cleared. Move back. Move back. ...two-shot of Cutler and Slovak. All right. All right. Give me the boat in the background. Do you really believe that your client is insane? Emil knew exactly what he was doing. Watch this. All right. Turn it off. This tape I kept for myself. In hospital I say I'm not crazy... and because of your double jeopardy law... we can't be tried for the same crime twice. We come out free, rich, and famous. Can we deal for this? It's free. Bruce! What would you say to evidence... that proves your client is not insane? "Top Story" has the truth right here... from Oleg Razgul himself. Emil. You knew what you were doing. It's all in here... in my movie. Officers, do your duty and arrest this man! I'm not the killer. I'm the director. Action! - Back off! - Let her go! Everyone, back away from me! Tell him to put his gun down. Hold your fire! Do not fire your weapons! - Stay back! - All right. Nobody's gonna fire, all right. Nobody's gonna fire. - Hold that line! - Let her go! - Tell him to put his gun down. - All right, all right. Stay back! Stay back! Get that shotgun out of here! - Nobody's gonna fire. - Stay back! Nobody's gonna fire, all right. Everybody, get back! Do not fire, anyone! - Lower those weapons! - Go tighter. Now! Lower! All right. Tell him to put his gun down! - Put your weapon down! - Let her go! If he doesn't lower his gun, I'll fucking kill her! - Officer, lower that weapon! - Lower your gun! - Remember what he did to Eddie! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Do not fire that weapon! I'll surrender... I'll surrender if he lowers his gun. No, don't you let him surrender. Don't you let this piece of shit surrender! If you don't let me surrender, I kill her now. - I don't care! - I kill her now. Do not fire that weapon! - Shut up! - Take that shot, Jordy! God damn it! You take that fucking shot! Officer, for the last time, lower your weapon! - No. - Look, he's lowered the weapon. Don't shoot her. He's lowered his weapon. You take that shot, Jordy. Look, he lowered his weapon. You don't have to shoot her. - No, Jordy. - He's lower the gun. He lowered the weapon, all right? You're okay. Don't look back. Don't look at him. Fuck! Did you get that? Fuck! Come on, let's go. Let's get you out of here. Come on, let's go. Hey, boss. He's still alive. Come on. Let's go. How was that? That was great. Jordy. Thanks. Hey. I thought you might want that. Alan, here. Take this camera. Marshal. Marshal, you feel up to making a statement? No! All right. Forget it. No statement. Cut the camera. Cut the camera. Listen, I can help you. Take a lesson from Eddie. The media can be a powerful ally. Hey, Eddie was my friend. I'd like to be yours, too. Good job. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah, fuck him, yes. Follow him walking away, and then whip back to me. We've been talking with Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw. He's understandably over whelmed... with what's just occurred here today, the tragic end of two vicious psychopaths... who attempted to manipulate the news media... for their own greed and egos. We at "Top Story" will never allow ourselves... to be used in this way. Our goal is to bring you the news in all its complexity. The truth was the real hero here today... and we're proud to have brought it to you... exclusively on "Top Story." This is Robert Hawkins. Good night.
