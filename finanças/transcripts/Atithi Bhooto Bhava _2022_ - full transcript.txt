"Song on Radio" "Song on Radio" "Song on Radio" "Song on Radio" Grandpa, I am preparing for a test. Which subject? Tell me. Hindi. Essay? Yes, it's an essay. Feel free to ask if you need my help. But grandpa, you can't read. I can do essays. What is the topic of your essay? Love... Love for the motherland. Essay on love for the motherland. Love for the motherland. When you're done writing the essay, don't forget to hand it over to her. That will be your real test. Understand, Makhan? - Well, grandpa, I am just-- - I've been your age. Make a note, Makhan. It's important to fall in love, and express it. But...what if I fail? Your grandpa's here. Swear on God. If you fail, your grandpa will unite you with your love. Don't be afraid, son. Go for it. And yes, instead of 'Dear Manju', start with 'My Manju'. It will make a better impression. Don't stay out too long, Manju, we're expecting some guests. Today? "...can't take my eyes off you." Hey, Genda. That's Mr. Genda! Whatever. Do you have a rose? 50 paisa a piece. - What is this? - Rose. - What's his name? - "Genda" (marigold). See...and you say it's a rose. Unbelievable, Gendamal, trying to rob a child of his money. Why you... At least give me something. "Since the day I saw you," "my world seems beautiful." "You're like the dawn of light," "the scarlet evening." "There's a flame burning in my soul," "for you." "There's something like love between us," "tell me what's it called." "There's something like love between us," "tell me what's it called." "The breeze carries your fragrance every day," "tell me what is this saga." God, Netra, let me sleep. This is not the way to wake anyone up. God, you don't remember anything. I've been doing the morning shift for a week. Wake up. I've to leave early, Sri, please! God, your morning shift ruins my beauty sleep. You can sleep after I'm gone, Srikant, please. Get up! Thank you, thank you. If you butter me so much, what will you put on the bread? Okay, let's go. - Omelette? - Yes, please. I'll go get ready quickly. Okay. And suddenly he went down on his knees, in front of everyone. The flight was being announced. The security, travellers, and air hostesses, were impatiently waiting for the girl's reaction. What is she going to do? A minute ago, they were frantically quarrelling. The girl even threw her bag on the floor. Everyone thought that boy's gonna get slapped. But no, she leapt forward and kissed him. And she said yes. Yuck? Yuck? You found it 'yuck'? That was so romantic, and you found it repulsive. What's romantic about it? Proposing at the airport in front of everyone. Publicity stunt. Forgot who I was discussing romance with. Let it be. I'm not as dry as you think. Remember how long it took me to impress you. Back then, you needed me, now I've become a obligation. My value has depreciated. Oh, God. Poor little helpless woman! See for yourself, I've told you a dozen times. No chillies in my omelette. But no. Fine, I'll eat it. Doesn't taste the same without chillies. For you! Not me! We've been living together for four years, Sri. And you're still clueless about my likes and dislikes. Hey, wait a minute. Just because I put some chilly? Yes, just because you put chilly. And this chilly symbolises how much you care for me. Hello, wait a minute. Stop lecturing me like a wife. So let me speak... I've no clue when I will become a wife. What? - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - What? Why does every conversation lead to marriage? Why not? We've been living together for four years, Netra, in a live-in. Everyone knows what our relationship status is. Does it need an official seal? That means making me your wife is out of the question. Thank God at least you still admit I am your girlfriend. And for the sake of that, Sri, don't take this relationship for granted. I am not taking it for granted. - Just because I put some chilly? - Yes. That's rubbish. I got up and made breakfast for you. - I do it every day-- - Hello. You don't get up on your own, and make breakfast. I wake you up, request you, and I do it every day. But at least I make it, don't you see that? You only make it because you like cooking. If you weren't taking this relationship for granted, Sri, you'd remember that I'm allergic to chillies. What is this... You'd also remember, I can't sleep with the lights and TV on. You'd remember my shift. You'd also remember, that two days ago it was our 'first-meeting' anniversary. - And you'd also remember-- - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. - You're laughing? - 'First-meeting' anniversary? - Yes. Which anniversary is this? And how many useless people in the world remember all this? - Srikant, let it be-- - I didn't forget your birthday. Apparently, everything is funny to you, Srikant, so keep laughing all the time. Unbelievable. 'First-meeting' anniversary? Then there must be a 'First-kiss' anniversary too. Or the first time I saw her hands, and her hair. Am I a calendar? And she left me 'hanging', like a calendar. How can girls argue over every irrelevant things? It's an art, and not everyone has it. I know, I know, guys are laughing. I want to know how does anyone measure love? Is there a scale? I'm overflowing with so much love, it won't fit in any bag. You can't measure it with an inch tape either. But my girlfriend couldn't see that love. It's tough to show them your love. Felt a nudge, didn't you? I knew it. And I made a blunder. I served her chilly in the morning. Because my girlfriend doesn't like chillies, and I love chillies. That's why she's my girlfriend. That is it, guys. That's me. Thank you very much. This applause is for the audience. Because no one's ever laughed so much at his jokes before. A big round of applause for Srikant Shirodkar. A poor victim of his girlfriend. Anyway, girls are impressed when you do what she wants, not what you want. I'm Sucharita Singh, and thank God, I am not his girlfriend. It was a good set. You were on a roll. Thanks, Sri. By the way, I shouldn't have said that last line. You felt offended, didn't you? Very offended. Sorry. So, you fought with Netra again, didn't you? Where did that come from? Whenever you fight with her, you crack jokes on her. It's quite evident. You've a pattern. I feel God's gifted women with an art. They can fight over every small issue. Dude, every fight is over a small issue. Rohit and I used to argue over little issues. Mostly. That's why you broke up with him, didn't you? So? Do you want to break up as well? Are you crazy? Ouch! God. How can you drive this? Sri, please, it's a cool car, okay. I can't even look at it. Can't even think of getting in. I feel sad for you, man. First, go impress Netra. Despite the applause from the public, your content is getting repetitive. Tonight's the night... to end the fight. Tonight's the night to take the flight. Tonight's the night, to switch on the lights! Stay away. Stay away. Let me warn you, sir. I am married, and my husband works at the Rickshaw association. What are you doing here, Gayatri? I told you to take the day off. Why? Did you invite someone else? What? Is it a new girl? Are you crazy? Why would I invite someone else? I wouldn't know. You and Netra are always fighting. So I thought... These roses, the lighting, all this must be for a girl. Don't rack your brains. Just leave. Then this leave won't be counted. I won't. Just leave with your husband in the rickshaw. Fine, I'm leaving. Gayatri, I told you to leave me alone toda-- What does she do with you on other days? Why did you come here? What? This is my home too. But...what is all this? I planned a surprise for you. The lights were supposed to be off, and I was supposed to turn them on when you show up. But it's all ruined now. Wow! I am impressed! - But what is it today? - What? Why do we need an occasion to celebrate? We can do it whenever we want. - Allow me. - I see. You're always grumbling that 'I don't care about you'. So look at this, 'I do care about you'. Candles, flowers, red wine, and your favourite fish fry. Without chilly. Did you remember since morning? Of course. And come here, come here. There is something more. This gift for you. An expensive one. Take it. What happened? You're doing this, because I told you about the incident on the flight. What? You didn't want to get married, then what is this? I never said I am getting married. - I am not proposing-- - Then what is all this drama for? This is not drama. This is not a ring, they are earrings. I bought these earrings worth 58,000 for you. Am I crazy to plan all this since morning? It's very difficult to keep you happy, man. Really? So you're doing all this, to prove that you can be romantic too. You care about our relationship! Damn you, man! Netra, you're too much. You always want me to express my love-- Damn you! If there's no emotion behind it, then no need to give my birthday any importance, Sri. What's your birthday got to do with all this? Sir, lemonade. Thanks...wait a minute. Come here. How do you know I'll order lemonade? You dressed in casuals, so lazy men don't drink whiskey. Sorry sir, but would you stand up? You don't have a belly, so no beer either. And there's a slight ego visible on your face, so definitely no Breezer either. You're very cute, sir, the lemonade kind. That was an impressively detailed observation. He's not the lemonade type. He's the 'mango pulp' type. Mango pulp. Sir, you're getting cuter than one can handle. Mister, just give everyone what they want. Real life is a solid source of comedy. Shirodkar, you forgot her birthday, out of all the things. Thanks. Stop laughing. Stop pulling my leg. I spent so much and made a fool of myself. Netra will remember this for life. She will make my life hell. Since we're in a live-in, everything is for granted. Take today for instance. He decorated the entire house, and even cooked my favourite dish. He bought earrings worth 58,000, but... 58,000? Are you mad? And you have a problem with him? But he forgot my birthday. I only forgot her birthday, it's not a big crime. Things were better before, when we lived separately. I used to remember all the dates. It was fun back then, since everything was special. Meeting up, spending hours together, buying gifts for each other. But now, since we live together, anyone can forget these things. He should know what my likes and dislikes are. He doesn't care about my emotions at all. And anyway, I don't like these pretentious relationships. - Do you want to break up with him? - No. Why are you getting annoyed if you don't know? Drink up. We'll decide later. Vodka shots. Lady's drink. You're absolutely right, sir. It's difficult to understand women. Come here. You're so right. Females are very difficult to understand. He's right. That's tequila. Hey, take it easy. One more, sir, complimentary. Hey...stop it. No more lemonade or mango pulp. "The night's young," "deprived of fun." "finally given up," "after losing her heart so many times." "Confronts me," "eludes me" "Teases you with a smile on her face." "Every day...she stops me," "I wonder why." "Every time she interrupts me," "I wonder why." "Like this moment is precious," "all I say is day by day it drives me crazy." "This heart of yours," "is like a shooting star." "Wanders aimlessly." "Never in one place." "Let it be." "Can't trust the heart." "Loves only himself." "Can never belong to one." "Let's have some fun tonight," "Who knows tomorrow," "where we might be." "It's treacherous, with awful habits." "all I say is day by day it drives me crazy." (Spanish) "Young and handsome and crazy, You are my heart" "Take my hand my boy, Release me my love" "All my life i want, To be in love..." "It's time to have fun," "stop thinking about tomorrow." "I want to say..." (Spanish) "Young and handsome and crazy, You are my heart" "Take my hand my boy, Release me my love" "Every day...stops you," "I wonder why." "Every time she interrupts me," "I wonder why." "Like this moment is precious," "all I say is day by day it drives me crazy." You're good. You are very good. What the... Hey... Why are you peeing here? Hey...can't you find another place? Who is it? What have you done down there? - Who is it? - Who is it? - Who? - What the... You can hear my voice? You... You? You can hear me? This is unbelievable. No turban, no beard. You look different, grandpa. Greetings. No, not a tailor, I am a stand-up comedian. I come up with excellent jokes. Hi, Srikant Shirodkar. Shirodkar. Marathi. What a form? Wow! - Wow! - Goodnight. What goodnight? - Do you want a kiss? - Kiss me. No, no, it was a joke. It was a joke. Where are you going? You peed in my home. - Where am I going to sleep? - At home. This is my home, grandpa. I've been hanging here for several years. But this is a tree. This tree is my home. So... I know what you want. You guys are... No, grandpa, no. I don't want money. I want to sleep, grandpa. Sleep. Okay, sorry, sorry. I'll get it cleaned tomorrow. But where will I sleep tonight? My bedroom will reek of pee. God. Fine, you can sleep in my home tonight. Tomorrow I'll give you money, a mattress, - ...and get the place cleaned. - What? You're inviting me home. Yes, Netra won't show up tonight anyway. Are you actually inviting me home? Look... You can come along if you want to. -Come on. -This is exactly what I wanted, grandpa. When we will meet? When can I come over? Which one's the ignition button, grandpa? "TV sound." Netra, please turn off the TV. I'll make breakfast for you. Please turn the volume down. "TV sound." "TV sound." Bravo. Wait a second. "TV sound." "TV sound." Who are you? Greetings, grandpa. You still snore like you used to. I do sometimes when I am tired. Yes, I know. What an amazing movie. Wait a minute, who are you? Did you forget? You shouldn't drink alcohol if you can't digest it. You said that when I was a kid. Come watch this film, it's too good. What? Last night... peeing under the tree... - Okay, okay, fine... - My home. I remember. I brought you here. No, grandpa, I brought you home. You were sloshed. - Yeah, thank you. - You're welcome. Slept well, didn't you? - Now leave. - Really good. Really good. Years later I slept so well. My backbone feels straight again, grandpa. Well, you had your sleep, but not me. So just leave now. I'll give you money, buy yourself a new mattress. No, grandpa, I like this mattress. - I won't go back. - What? - Why? - Move, grandpa. You've got everything here TV, fridge, AC, you brought me here, grandpa. Will you insult your guest? You've never done that before. - What guest? - Don't turn it off... Don't take undue advantage of my goodness. Come on. I come at your will, but leave only when I wish to. What do you mean? Meaning that I won't leave until my job here isn't done. What's that? And I can't sleep hanging upside down from the tree, grandpa. You try hanging upside down. Why should I hang upside down? This is my home, understand. You get out. Your home is my home. Your home is my home, grandpa. It's the same thing. Your home is my home. Your home is my home. I am being polite because of your age, - ...understand. - Or else... Or else what, grandpa? "I was silly, stupid, crazy." Hello, Vidrohi. Can you hear me? Come up quickly. A thief has barged into my house. Need to throw him out. And listen, bring your baton. Now watch. I am a thief, and that baton's for me... Okay, grandpa, I'll stay seated here. Continue watching this film. Just don't turn it off. Let him come. Do what you want, grandpa. I am not going anywhere. Wait. Just wait here. What happened, Srikant sir? Throw him out. I brought him home, and now he's refusing to leave. Why are you laughing? It's okay, sir. These things happen. What happens? Influence. Influence of alcohol. Normally, the effect of alcohol stays through the night, but sometimes in the morning... What are you blabbering? Throw him out? Who? Come on, let's go. Let's go, you swine! Get up. How dare you trouble sir? Come on, I'll show you today. You'll learn your lesson today. Hey...stop cradling the air. Have you lost your mind? Are you blind? Can't you see him? You know what, you're delusional. Okay. So...you know what, get some sleep. Look Vidrohi... I'll talk to your superiors. Hey... Quiet! Grandpa...please. Turn it off. Look...you don't know me. Leave right now. Trying to intimidate me by speaking in Marathi? But I know you. You don't know me, grandpa. God... Who are you? - Makhan. - Makhan who? Truck driver. Age 55 plus 5. You mean 60. No, I've been dead for five years. Stop screwing with my mind... Open... What happened, son? Everything alright? No... He...he... He's a ghost. Hey, Vidrohi. Vidrohi. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Go do your job. Okay, sir. You sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Yuck. Srikant sir, wake up. Srikant sir...wake up. - What is it? - Netra ma'am just came back. She just got in the lift. - Netra? - Yes. Tell me honestly, did you really not see him last night? What are you saying, sir? These things happen. Go home and suck on some lemon. Get lost...suck on a lemon! Netra. Thank you. Forget that, what is all this? And Gayatri hasn't turned up yet. I was wondering where did you go, ...early morning, leaving the door open. Is he here? Who? - Makhan Singh. - Makhan Singh, who. He's a ghost. What rubbish is this, Srikant? It's not rubbish. Elders were right. Never pee under a tree at night. Otherwise, you get followed by a ghost. And I invited him home as a guest. Are you drunk? Are you evening listening to yourself? Netra, your bags are packed, isn't it? I'll pack my bags too. Let's go away for a couple of days. We'll stay at Priyanka's place. Are you out of your mind? I am not out of my mind. There is a ghost here. Listen...come here. Here... There's no one here. You probably had too much to drink last night, and you're having hallucinations. Chill. I'm not crazy to have hallucinations. He is a ghost. He drove me home last night. He's been talking to me, teasing me since morning. When I got up in the morning, he-- After last night's fight, this is what you come up with. Do you think I am an idiot? You think I'll forget last night's fight, hearing your rubbish story? What fight? I forgot your birthday. I am saying sorry. I'll say sorry a dozen times. I am even prepared to do squats. Saying sorry doesn't make things normal, Sri. Don't want it to be normal. But listen, there's a ghost here. We must leave, please. - Please...let's go. - Sri... Srikant, your hands are shivering. Come here. Sit. - You've a fever. - No, it's a ghost. We should call the doctor, Srikant. - Did you eat anything since morning? - No. Wait a second. Who kept this here? Here. Eat this. Silly boy. So...you can see him, and talk to him. Yes, I can see him and talk to him. But Vidrohi can't, nor Netra. Tell me something. What does he talk about? I mean, what does he want. Doctor, he was saying, he won't leave until his job here isn't done. You mean to say, he's in this room as we speak. Yes, he is. Sri...take this seriously. - Really? - I swear, doctor. Why are you scared, doctor? Tell him that he's hallucinating. His temperature has spiked. His BP could have spiked too. What happened, doctor? They exist. Ghosts exist. See, I told you. Where...is he right now? Doctor, there's no one there. - I am done. I have to leave. - What done? You've done nothing. G...G...Ghost. Doctor, where are you going? Srikant, you can't be joking all the time. I am not... Doctor, please. Please stop. Unbelievable, Srikant. You scared the doctor away with your senseless talks. What the hell? There is no such thing as... Ghost. Why did he bring us here? I don't know. Where is he? Right in front. Why can't I see him? I don't know. I am wondering why can I see him. Grandpa, this place is amazing. I came here often before I died. This place serves some amazing 'litti-chokha' and 'sarson-da-saag'. The best. Order it, grandpa. - Will you eat? - Eat? Doesn't matter whether I'll eat or not. It's good. You order, grandpa. Order right away. Wait a minute. Clarify something, why do you keep calling me grandpa? Doesn't that mean grandfather? - Grandfather? - Yes. You are my grandfather. You are my grandfather! Me? How can I be your grandfather? - You? Grandpa? - Yes. Didn't you say Sardar is an old man? Grandpa, I may be dead, but I still have feelings. - Old man? - No, no, sorry. That's rude. He's not old, he's mid-aged. Mid-aged. Sorry. But how am I your grandpa? This is your rebirth. What? What is he saying? Srikant, I don't understand a thing, - Srikant... - He's saying this is my rebirth. This is a problem. I'll have to explain... ...everything again, grandpa. Hello. So what will you have? What are we eating? Litti-chokha' and 'Sarson-da-saag', Raju, 'Litti-chokha' on this table. Anything you try here will be excellent. This is Gungun's diner, that's no joke. What...what... Don't scream. Don't scream. Now, you'll understand everything too. Yes. Actually, this happened in '75. 1975. I wasn't even born back then. No, that's when you died, grandpa. But then I should be around 50... I should be 55 years old. Oh, grandpa. It's not easy to be reborn as a human being again. The same old cycle of insects, worms, fish... But grandpa, you came back pretty quick I must have done something good. In 1975 you were 60 years old, and I was 16. You were my grandpa. And grandpa, so was Manju, for whom I used to ride five kilometres on my cycle. Manju? Yes...Manju... Manju Yadav. She was...my first love. And last. "Your smile's bright like sunflowers," "can't take my eyes off you." "Since the day I saw you," "my world seems beautiful." "You're like the dawn of light," "the scarlet evening." "There's a flame burning in my soul," "for you." "There's something like love between us," "tell me what's it called." And there's nothing wrong with being a mechanic. On top of that, there's my mother. No respite from her either. "Manju, don't hang around with that Sardar mechanic." It's not about the mechanic, it's the Sardar. "tell me what is this saga." Never get bored of the sweets from Shankar's shop? Mr. Mishra came over today. - Again? - Yes. And that idiot Sunil too. - Again? - Yes. He even gave me chocolate in the courtyard. Again? Aren't you annoyed? Why would I be annoyed over chocolate? He asked if I could cook. You are an amazing cook. I could get married to Sunil, Makhan? Really? Will you marry that Sunil? Not if someone stops me. "How do I express, the way you look" "dwelling in some corner of my heart?" "Like a dewdrop rolling down from the petals," "you're that dewdrop." "Whenever you call out to me," "my heart races in your direction ahead of me." "I'm reading your eyes," "instead of all the books." "Don't ever leave me, O companion," "at every twist and turn." "There's something like love between us," "tell me what's it called." "The breeze carries your fragrance every day," "tell me what this saga is." Listen, son. Yes, grandpa. Come here. Do you know about Heer-Ranjha? Heer-Ranja? The lovers? Haven't you heard the story? I have, but I don't remember anymore. She was a lovely girl, Heer. A boy came to her father asking for work. Ranjha. His flute sounded absolutely melodious. Just like Lord Krishna? Exactly like Him! It was pleasing to the ears. Heer was mesmerised too. She lost her heart to Ranjha. Even Ranjha loved her a lot. They die in the end, don't they? Everyone has to die one day, son, whatever the reason may be. But love should be memorable. And these memories will help you fight against the world. But why are you telling me all this? Because, son, love reflects in tears. Don't shed them unnecessarily. Let's go. Grandpa had a heart attack. Come It's important to fall in love, and express it. But what if I fail. Your grandpa is here. Swear on God, your grandpa will unite you with your love. I was heartbroken. I left the village and ran away to Mumbai. Worked hard, drove a truck. 40 years whizzed by. I never got married. I used to miss Manju. I wanted to see her just one more time. But just like you, even I died of a heart attack. Under the very tree, you were peeing. Since then, my spirit's been hanging there. Sorry, sorry, I didn't know. How painful. but still so romantic, Sri. You've been reborn. We met so that you can fulfil your promise to me. What promise... Uniting you with Manju. It's not an order, grandpa, just a request. Once... Just once I want to see Manju. Only once. Of course we will. These things happen only in books and movies. I want to know does true love really exist. Grandpa! Grandpa, this is amazing. Whiskey's turned into holy water. Is it a traditional day in your office? People are scared to see a ghost. They fear them. But you get a makeover. First of all, he's not a ghost, he's a spirit. - Right, Makhanji. - True. This way. And secondly, after watching Makhanji, I've become a believer. If spirits exist, then so does God. So true. And lastly, their love, Srikant, it's romantic. This is love. You should learn from your grandson...grandpa! Heard that. I've planned everything. We're going to Punjab this weekend. We'll take a flight to Chandigarh, and from there, we'll take a cab to Makhan Singh's village. There we'll look for Manju, okay. Who is going to Punjab? Why is she going to Punjab? - Done, I'll make the bookings. - Wait a minute? We're not going? We're not going to Punjab? Do all Sardars live in Punjab? Then where do they live? Wait a minute. Canada? - No... - Canada, how? Canada will be expensive. Shrikant, think about it. Not Canada. UP. Uttar Pradesh. - Uttar Pradesh! - Uttar Pradesh? Why are you two making faces? How can we go to Uttar Pradesh? It's the birthplace of Lord Ram and Krishna. The confluence of Ganga and Jamuna. And Manju lives there. Seriously, we're going to UP? We have to. We have to go to UP. How are we going? We'll take a flight to Lucknow. Then... I won't go in an airplane. Odd, a ghost scared of an airplane. - How else will we go? - I don't know. I never sat in a train or an airplane. I always drove cars and truck. This guy is unbelievable! - I mean ghost. - Why are you getting angry? His demands are growing. Now he needs a road trip. He's our guest. So... How do we say it? Guest... Guest is God. You mean ghost. Don't say that, Srikant. And anyway, Sri, a road trip sounds nice. She is right. This is your chance to see the world. - And me to see Manju. - But how? But Srikant, isn't UP quite far? If we don't take a flight, how else will we get there? Let me make it clear I'm not going on your bike. Me neither. We can take a cab. Do you two know how expensive cabs can be? You were never going to set foot in my car. How did this miracle happen? That's not the case. The car is good. Nice. It's a really nice car on the inside. The AC's excellent. Very nice car. Your car is just like you. Look's average on the outside, but has a heart of gold on the inside. Did you divorce Netra? Are you crazy? Aren't you from UP? I am from MP. From Gwalior. Good...Good. Then the road the Mathura must pass through Gwalior? Yes. Mumbai-Agra highway. - Perfect. - Why? No... what are you doing this weekend? Why? Be careful with the car. By the way, thanks for coming with us, Suchi. Now we have company, and didn't have to hire a cab either. By the way, I don't like long drives, you know. But finally, I can go home, and it will be a nice surprise for mom and dad. Did you have to bring her along? We lost two days. I didn't have money to hire a cab-- No money you say, grandpa. What about these clothes? You've money for these clothes. Remember, don't let her find out you're coming too. That's for you to remember, grandpa. What's the matter, Srikant sir? Nothing. Going somewhere? Yes, Uttar Pradesh. Agra, right? Do I look crazy, that I'll go to Agra's mental asylum? What are you doing? - I'll sit in the front, grandpa. - But why? I haven't seen the road zoom past for a long time. What's this? You guys make me look like a driver. One of you sit in the front. I'm going to sit in the front, grandpa. Well...we can't sit in the front. Actually, Netra has motion sickness. You do. She will keep puking if she sits in the front. So it's better I sit with her. Wait a second, aren't you an air hostess? How can you get motion sickness, if you sit in the front? I don't look out the airplane's window. Yeah. Anyway, do you know the way? I know the way, grandpa. This path will take me to my Manju. Hey, I am asking you. Yes, I know. I've a strong GPS. Let's go. Like your jokes? Let's just go. Tell her to hurry up, grandpa. "Soaring..." "My heart's soaring again..." "Bonding with you again." "The trail with your footprints on," "the heart's heading down that path." "Soaring..." "My heart's soaring again..." "Bonding with you again." "The trail with your footprints on," "the heart's heading down that path." "You're everywhere, I see only you, what's going on?" "I'm lost, somewhere in you." "What's wrong with me?" "Soaring..." "My heart's soaring again..." "Bonding with you again." Stop, stop. God. - What happened? - Sorry. - How you're you driving. - Sorry, sorry. - We got to go back. - Why? I forgot something. I must go get it. Hello, madam. We're in Nashik. There's no way we can go back. - What did you forget? - It's... Let it be. You won't understand. It's not important to you. - But it's obvious. - What is obvious? This is our first meeting with Manju, we must get a gift for her. We're the groom's family. Who is Manju? Manju is the bride. What are you saying? You never told me we're attending a wedding. I didn't tell you because, it's not what this looks like-- She just said we're the groom's family. Yes...aren't we the groom's family? Yeah, she did say we're the groom's family. We are. Actually, it's not what you think. Then? What is it? Are you two going to, help someone elope and get married? Yes...yes... It's something like that. This is going to be fun. Now, this trip just got exciting. I wasn't going to tell you. But since you're coming along, why keep secrets from you? By the way, you guys are unbelievable. Your own relationship is on rocky grounds, and you'll are helping someone else run away and get married. Nice. Keep it up. Good going. Hey... By the way, who is the groom? Makhan Singh. - Where is he? - Where is he? Isn't he here? Where... Where is he going? Why are you lying here like this? I've never seen death so closely, grandpa. What's wrong with Shirodkar? He's been acting weird since he got in the car. Why don't you take him to a psychiatrist? The cops are right, grandpa. Always wear a seatbelt. Sit. Hey... Why did you open the door and close it again? To let the ghost in. Hehehe...bad joke! And we can buy the gift from Nashik, okay. Chill. And now, we won't stop until we get Makhan married to Manju. His name is Makhan, isn't it? Yes, his name is Makhan. Manju and Makhan, like Heer and Ranjha. No, no, madam, please no more. I'll have to fold everything back again. How will we choose if we don't look? But I'm here to sell saris, not fold them. Stop screaming like my papa. We're looking. You should make up your mind before coming. Silk, cotton, or georgette. Blue, black, or yellow. 500, 2000, 5000! Lemon colour sari, grandpa. Who wears a lemon colour sari? Manju... Yeah, okay. Lemon colour. Show us a lemon colour sari. Silk...worth 5000. - Grandpa... - Cotton...worth 500. - Grandpa... - 500? That's all? You're taking advantage of me. Who started it? 500 is too less. You bought earrings worth 58,000 for me, and a sari worth only 500 for your grandson's girlfriend. Quiet. Wait a second. Wait a second. His grandson? And his girlfriend? Will she wear a sari? Sorry. Explain. Back in the day, people used to get married at an early age, and they used to have many children. So...it's like that. She is rather old. She is 70 years old. 55... Grandpa, she is 55. Fine...50. 55, grandpa. Yeah, okay. She's 55 years old. Yeah...she is 55. What? Manju is 55 years old. Shirodkar, what nonsense is this? Are we going to help her to elope and get married? Why are you revealing everything slowly? Grandpa... She will get us all killed, grandpa. Tell her, grandpa. Grandpa! Tell her to look forward. Your attention please, passengers. There are two exit doors in the front, two exit doors at the back. If the doors open, it's your funeral. That was too good. Does she drink, grandpa? She's laughing alone. By the way, how long have you two been living together? Four years now. What's your scene about marriage? Have you given it a thought? It's not important. We can get married whenever we want. Do it before you die. Otherwise, your spirit will keep wandering. What do you think? Will she like this anklet? Looks expensive. It's made of silver. She will definitely say no to Mishra's son. Grandpa always said, it's important to make your love memorable. It gives you courage. She is here. Chitra...your mother is calling you. Do you have guests at home? God, since you got engaged, my mother's been pestering me. Well, see you then, guys. I've to prepare sweets. You got engaged? Why didn't you tell me? No one stopped me. He was so embarrassed, that he immediately let go. Netra, you should come for his stand-up someday. He makes so much fun of relationships, don't ask. Well, it's the only thing he knows. It's just a joke, chill. Grandpa. - Grandma looks angry. - Who? - Grandma. - Grandma? Suchi...stop if you see a diner. I think I need a break. Need to pee, don't you? I do too. It's hard to control now. Grandpa... The diner's pretty far away. I think it's better if she does it under some tree. The diner's pretty far away. - Go sit under a tree or something-- - Hello...we're not like you, who can do it anywhere we like. Bro...it was so unhygienic, man. What is this? Say what you might, but it was fun. Under the open sky, amidst the cool breeze. Grandpa. Grandpa. Don't you want to go too? I've stopped peeing in the open. Why? Sir... We've hair clips, hair pins, bangles-- It's of no use to me. Don't want it. Then tell me what you do. I am stand-up comedian. Comedian? What's that? I tell jokes. I get paid for it. Get paid for telling jokes! Ballu, even you can tell jokes. Tell him a joke. Do you? Then tell me. Once there's a Sardar. Hey, Shirodkar! What's wrong with you? Even your audience never laughs this hard? Did you remember one of my jokes? "The paths look like your face," "your smile's scattered ike the sun's rays." "You're close...very close to me." "But I'm still looking all over for you." "Don't know where my destination lies," "but I'll be treading down this path." Shirodkar, what's wrong with it now? I think the ghost sitting next to you, doesn't like your songs. "Soaring..." "My heart's soaring again..." "Bonding with you again." "The trail with your footprints on," "the heart's heading in that direction." "You're everywhere, I see only you, what's going on?" "I'm lost, somewhere in you." "What's wrong with me?" "Soaring..." "My heart's soaring again..." "Bonding with you again." Did you see how oily the vegetables were? They want to kill their customers. Yeah...I think I'll take a trip to the washroom. Grandpa...how many times will she keep going to the washroom? - Let's go. - I cannot comment on that. Grandpa, we're wasting time. I am missing Manju a lot. I wonder where she is, in what state? Whether she's married, or-- Wait a second. Wait a second. Is Manju still alive? Yes. I mean, she must be your age. - So... - Shut up, Sri. So, what if like you, she's also... Don't be so negative, Sri. It's not about being negative or positive. It's pretty frank. We should know whether she's dead or alive. She must be, grandpa. Must be? You should know for sure, whether she's alive or not. There are no two ways about it. You don't need to think so hard. She must be alive, grandpa. Someone must be guaranteeing about you too. But you're dead, aren't you? What are you saying, Sri? I am saying that we don't know, whether the one we're looking for is alive or not. Don't say that, grandpa. She's my first true love. What has that got to do with this? You're such a negative person. We've a small job to do, and you're throwing tantrums. You do nothing yourself. And when someone is trying to do something, you're finding flaws with him. - Yes! - What yes? I am not trying to find flaws. I am being practical. - Fine, let's admit she's alive. - Admit? Yeah, okay. But what if we get there, and find out she got married, ...and moved to Andaman? - Then? - Then we'll go there too. - What are you saying? - What is your problem? Someone's love is alive even after he's dead! He wants to fill that void, and is using us as a medium, Sri. So that's a good thing. - But there's no logic in it. - Logic? - This is your rebirth. - Yes... Your grandson is a middle-aged Sardar, who is dead. And his ghost is with us, Sri. Do you see the logic in any of this? There is no logic. But it's all happening. That's the problem. No, the problem is you. You know, you take all your relationships for granted, Sri. Wait a minute, this is not about us, understand. - Don't fight, grandpa. - Be quiet! This is about us! We've been together since college. When you didn't want to get married, and be in a live-in. That's okay, I am there. Quit your job, that's okay. I am there. You started doing stand-up. That's okay, I am there. In every stand-up, you made fun of our relationship, but that's okay. I let it pass as a joke. Why? Because I love you. But you don't appreciate it, and you know what, Sri. Appreciation of love should be expressed. And someone else wants to do it even after he's dead, then don't raise stupid questions. If there's a one per cent chance, I will unite Makhan with his love. Have you lost your mind? What's this, grandpa? You've changed completely like your name. Get lost. Shirodkar, did something happen while I was gone? "There are two hearts living in me, who should I listen to?" "Both in conflict with each other." "The dreams that dwelled in my eyes," "now seem like tears of sorrow." "I am here, and so are you," "yet we seem miles apart." "If you're upset with me," "my destiny's upset with me." "Why is this happening?" "I am losing everything." "Is your heart crying," "just like me?" "There are two hearts living in me, who should I listen to?" "Both in conflict with each other." "Every moment we smiled," "those were moments divine." "You were here, so was I?" "Our home was fragrant with our love." "You can complain," "but don't resent." "Say what's on your mind," "but don't keep it a secret from me." "I never stopped you from saying anything." "This isn't the road I had imagined to be." "There are two hearts living in me, who should I listen to?" "Both in conflict with each other." "The dreams that dwelled in my eyes," "now seem like tears of sorrow." Grandpa, as Mathura's drawing closer, I feel anxious. You still look excited like a 16-year-old kid. That's the age we got separated. Never grew old. Even if centuries go by, love should never grow old. I loved Manju a lot. Actually, I still do. And we also fought a lot. Really? You two had fights? Everyone does. Back then, I used to think 'why me'. "Why should I apologise?" And she thought, why should she apologise. Childishness. But as the years went by, I realised... If there's a fire, it needs to be put out first. Whether she does it first or me. Meaning? Ego, grandpa. Me...I... It's the journey from 'me' to 'us', These fights are hard to get out of your mind. So it's better to make some happy memories. It's important to fall in love, and express it, grandpa. You said this. Did you forget? It's a good thing you sat in the front. This way you'll get over your fear, and I won't feel like a driver either. That idiot was from Gwalior. If I see him now, I'll run over him. What did he do to deserve that? A lot. I can't begin to tell you. Fine, then don't tell me. Leave it. It started in school. He used to make cards for me. Remember those cassettes. He used to record songs on it for me. And wrote scrapbooks too. It was very cute. He also dropped me home every day. And also gave me chocolates every day. But he continued...even in college. He used to give me cards. He would say 'I love you' publicly, and every day. Every day he would do something for me. And he wouldn't even feel embarrassed, to hold my hands in public. - So? - But I did. I never made any boyfriends in college because of him. Ridiculous. - But he was your boyfriend. - No! He was in school, but that's it. Who will tolerate such a clingy and over-expressive boyfriend? - Suchi. - Hi, mom. My child. How are you? How are you? How am I looking? - Jacky Shroff. - Still? Exactly like Jacky Shroff. But what's wrong with me? She's come home after 1.5 years. Come inside. Come in. Come, guys. Come in. Work faster. Give me that plate. I'll keep it inside. Hello. Hi. - Suchi. - Hi. Is he your boyfriend? No, no, he's my friend. - And she's his girlfriend. - She's just... - God bless you. - Thank God. Or things could have been messed up. - Let's go. - What? Come on. Come on. Sit. Sit. - Sit. - Come. Everyone in Mumbai does. Suchi...after all these days. You'll stay, won't you? No. I am. I am. Be careful with the effigy. Suchi now looks like this. But she looked really smart in her childhood. People would say she looks like her father. Isn't that right, Pratha? Come on, papa. You just... What? Am I lying? I looked just like Jacky Shroff when I was young. Any street that I walked on, girls would peek from their windows. - Right? - Amazing. Thank you. Well, if she had been a boy, - he would've been handsome and smart. - Welcome to my world. But Suchi's fine too. Right, child. Yes, she's fine. You must be getting content, aren't you? Don't you dare... Uncle looks pretty smart even at this age, he deserves some praise. The praiseworthy deserves praise. - Isn't it? - Go ahead. So tell me, uncle, do you use any special soap, - or is this natural-- - Srikant! Seriously. It's all in our genes. All the guys in our family are handsome like me. Yeah... Now, we'll get Suchi married to a handsome guy like me. It will be a mix of our genes and his. Right? And the children can always choose which 'genes' they want. "Your eyes are beautiful," "Your face glows brightly." "Your eyes are beautiful," "Your face glows brightly." "You're my Mother Goddess." "You're my Mother Goddess." What is this, mom? When will papa ever change? He...never grows old. Let it go. Aunty, don't you feel angry? I do feel irritated, child, but never angry. Here. Despite everything, he does love me a lot. And he may not brag in front of me, but he can't live without eating my cooking. And everyone has some flaws, child. But once you ignore these flaws, life becomes easy. And anyway, matches are made in heaven. Our job is to keep them intact and abide by them. Mother Goddess... I vaguely remember my mother's face. But I know she must love me a lot. But I've a regret. I never could express my love to her. I never asked her for anything. But you're a mother too. So I request you, just once... let me meet Manju. Wait. Wait. I heard that ghosts can't be where God exist. But the spirit unites with his Creator. You said this. Yes. Did you take offerings? Next time I will stay longer, I promise. - You promise? - Promise. - She is lying. - No! I will. Bye. You're back again. It's been five years. Get over me. At least let me have this right. Rohit, it's been too long. Honestly, I've nothing left now. Doesn't matter. I do. You can borrow some. And then? Then whatever you say. Your happiness is more important. Grandpa, true love never lets you forget. Not even after death. Okay, then. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, mom. - Bye, child. Bye. Thanks. The boy isn't too good-looking, but his jeans were pretty nice. Please... They looked branded... Leave her alone. Tell her to drive faster. She is going fast. And we're pretty close now. I know it's very close, but just a little... She's going slow. Suchi, drive a little faster. - Okay. - But drive safe. Done. "He's my Lord...my benevolent Lord." "The magnificent one." "He's the effervescent and Ominous one." "He's my Lord...my benevolent Lord." "The magnificent one..." Stop. Stop. Tell her to stop, grandpa. Stop the car. Hey...what's wrong? Hail Lord Krishna. Grandpa. Grandpa, we've reached. - Give me a minute. - Grandpa, we're here. We're here, grandpa. My heart is pounding. Your heart is pounding. It's a figure of speech. Understand the emotions. Lord Krishna, the Creator, Mother Goddess... Being a Sikh you believe in all of them. Whether you offer prayers in a Gurdwara or a temple, they all go to one place. You taught me this, grandpa. Did you forget? Now, grandpa, we need to write a letter. Like the I wrote back then. Then write it. No, you have to write it, grandpa. Yes, grandpa. Please, grandpa. This is the neighbourhood, but the streets look different. Even the streets have become Chinese. They all look the same. Listen. Where does Manju Yadav live? Manju Yadav. It's that house in the front, and one in the alley at the back. And yes, that house on the top is also Manju Yadav's. It's a very uncommon name, isn't it? The house near the city square is also Manju Yadav's Ask him where's the banyan tree? There used to be a banyan tree here. Ask him if the banyan tree is still here. Ask him. Ask him, grandpa. Where's the banyan tree, son? Why didn't you say that? There's only one banyan tree, at the corner of that alley. Coming. Wait. Yes, mister. What do you want? Take a look. Take a look. Sorry...are you Manju Yadav? No...my name is Puja. Puja Sharma. Mrs. Puja Sharma. Do you know where we can find Manju Yadav? Manju Yadav... They used to live here until a few years ago. Can you tell us where they are nowadays? That reminds me. Many years ago, Rameshwar Yadav lived here. Before we did. Father. Manju's father. Ms. Manju's father. - Manju's father. - Ms. Manju... Yes, Ms. Manju's father. Can you tell us where she is now? I don't know where she is now. But I do know they left Mathura. But I don't know where. Listen... God...we don't know where Manju's house is. How will we help her elope? And where is this Makhan? Grandpa, let's go home once. Only once. Take a left. - Left? - You know? How do you know the way? Go straight and stop next to the temple. Stop. Stop. What is this place? This is Makhan's house. Is he going to keep Manju here? {\i1}"Listen, son."{\i0} {\i1}"Yes, grandpa."{\i0} {\i1}"Come here."{\i0} {\i1}"Everyone has to die one day, son."{\i0} {\i1}"But your love should be immortal."{\i0} {\i1}"And these memories,"{\i0} {\i1}"will give you the courage to face the world."{\i0} {\i1}"But why are you telling me all this."{\i0} {\i1}"Because, son, love reflects in tears."{\i0} {\i1}"Don't waste it."{\i0} {\i1}"And what if I fail."{\i0} {\i1}"Your grandpa's here."{\i0} {\i1}"Swear on God,"{\i0} {\i1}"if you fail,"{\i0} {\i1}"then your grandpa will unite you with your son."{\i0} - I'll go check on him. - Wait. Hear my story first. God... Grandpa... you took good care of this ghost. But it's time to go now. I have to go. But, Makhan. I apologise for any inconvenience. I apologise for any inconvenience. I should apologising, Makhan. No... I couldn't recognise you. You made me realise my mistakes. Everyone learns from their mistakes. Did I say that too? I am saying this. - But Makhan-- - No, grandpa. No. Makhan. Grandpa. Grandpa. Wake up, grandpa. It's holi. Today is Holi. Ghost. Hey...didn't I tell you last night there's a ghost. - What is it? - See... - Wake up. - There is no one. There is. It's a ghost. I told you last night there's a ghost. See. It's just me. Come on. Let's get some sweets from Shankar's shop and then leave. Milk and sweetmeats? I did see a ghost here. Get up. Hey, idiot. You've grown old. Put four sweetmeats in the milk, and two spoons of cream. - And a pinch of-- - Saffron. Saffron. Did you have to come on Holi? Now that you're here, go take the Lord's blessings. "A bond that connects," "your sights with mine." "It's on my lips," "the moments I've been stealing." "I wish to share these secrets with you." "Pick my share of dreams from the lot." "I've witnessed," "the form love exists in." "My heart flutters like a bird." "Flutters...in your land." "My heart flutters like a bird." "Flutters...in your land." My Manju. My letter and my words, have been anxious for centuries to reach you. Should have conveyed my feelings to you many years ago. But fate cannot be controlled. I know, just like I came back for you even after I died, though alive you feel lifeless without me. I knew...we'll meet. Just like you waited for me all your life, I did too. Today I'm going to say what I never said before. Manju...I love you. And always will. "I wonder why," "my heart tells me to walk in your direction." "I am treading towards you." "I wonder why," "my heart tells me to walk in your direction." "I am treading towards you." "All our conversations," "The sleepless, lonely nights," "My heart's soaring like a kite in the horizon of love." "I wish to share these secrets with you," "Pick my share of dreams from the lot."

"A bond that connects," "your sights with mine." "the moments I've been stealing." Srikant, Manju's still inside. What are we doing outside? She's there... Where is she? "We've met like so, beloved." "Like the sky meets at the horizon." "We've met like so, beloved." "Like the skies meet at the horizon." "Your soul is with me now." "Forever we shall soar in the skies, and never separate." "I wish to share these secrets with you," "Pick my share of dreams from the lot." "I've witnessed the form in which love exists." "My heart flutters like a bird." "Flutters...in your land." I love you, Netra. I don't want to lose you. I understood this after travelling 1100 kilometres. Netra, I want to cook breakfast for you. I'll put chilly in it and also listen to your rebukes. And I want to do it every day. In this lifetime, and in all the lifetimes to come. Will you marry me? "A bond that connects," "your sights with mine." (Spanish) "Young and handsome and crazy, You are my heart" "Take my hand my boy, Release me my love" "All my life i want, To be in love..." "It's time to have fun," "stop thinking about tomorrow."
