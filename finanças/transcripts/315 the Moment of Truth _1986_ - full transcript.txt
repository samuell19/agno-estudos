I made sure those students knew exactly who was boss. - The good old days, huh? Think things are ever that good? - At least we used to be able to control them. I mean, we had a unified school board, faculty, we had kids whose parents laid down the law. Now we got curriculum disputes, we got pay disputes, I got all sorts of special interest groups on my back, I mean, those students are not students, they're a bunch of little terrorists. - Yeah.

So the way I hear it, uh, after Cinco kicked your ass, you went to the cops and got him popped. - Jim, what were the cops doing here in the first place? - I'm just telling you what's going around, man. But a lot of people are upset. Very upset. - Well, in a couple of days they'll be un-upset. (student coughing) - What happened? - The cops were on Cinco.

It's not gonna happen. - [Homer] (on PA) As you are all well aware, metro police conducted a locker search yesterday, turning up over $12000 worth of drugs. Now, let it be known that I am committed to this kind of action until drugs have been completely eliminated from Lincoln High. There is no place for drug use on this campus. Five young men were arrested yesterday in connection with selling drugs and the authorities have assured me that these criminals will receive the stiffest penalties under the law. Now, let them serve as an example to all of you. (Smiley laughing) - Stiff penalty. - As you probably know, Luis "Smiley" Gonzalez was in school today. - And that just makes me the laughingstock of this school. Here I promised swift, hard punishment to drug dealers, they're back in school the next day. - You shouldn't make promises you can't keep. (typewriter clacking nearby) Now, where was I? Uh, oh yeah. Loreno, he had five joint on him. That'll get him a traffic ticket. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, Moran. Back up. What do you mean promises I can't keep? - Look, you wanted to prove something. But what you don't realize is it's a situation too far gone for police work to get done what you need done. I mean, you called for this bust and I made it. Me and my guys had a good workout. But it's all bullshit. - It sounds to me like you're saying this situation is totally out of hand. - You know, I bet you could put two and two together and really come up with something. - No, I don't accept that. I do not accept that things are out of my control. I can't work that way. What are you, anyway, some sort of expert? - Look, you want me to give you this report or not? Now, Cinco claims the stuff that he had was planted on him by another student, Jeff Hannah. Now, I'd like to talk to him if that's okay. - Use this office. I want to be there. We cleaned his record of gang activity. He owes us. We can use him. - This type of road sign informs highway users of certain traffic laws or regulations which apply to those sections of the roadway where the signs are ... Can't his wait till after class? - Can't you read? I mean, it says it's important. (students laugh) - I can read. Can you read? Stand up straight. Now get out. Jeff, Horner wants to see you in his office. Failure to comply with the directions indicated on such signs constitutes a violation of law. The primary purpose of these signs is to promote safe and efficient use of streets. - We have one case: Cinco. We had him dead to rights with a bag of smack. But he claims the stuff was yours. - Yeah, what do you think? - Doesn't matter what I think. It matters what the DA thinks. - So? - So, with the shitty evidence we got, he's declined to prosecute, Cinco's gonna go free and I understand he's threatened to kill you. - Jeff, you've got all this gang activity behind you. Don't screw up now. - What do you want me to do? You want me to testify against Cinco? - That's the only way we're gonna get a conviction. You see, I don't know why you don't want to help me. I helped you. Draper came, said we had to clean your record so you could play ball. I cooperated, I want something back. - It's Cinco's word against mine and I got a damn good reason to lie. What do you think I should do? You think I should cooperate, Moran? - Well, what can I say, kid? Life's tricky. - (scoffs) Look, I'm a guaranteed dead man if word gets out I'm a narc. All I got now is the Cobras on me. If I testify, it'll be the whole damn school. It's real tricky. - Well, I can't hold him for more than 36 hours without charging him. (Jeff sighs) - Well, it's simple. You're gonna let him out and he's gonna try to kill me. - Isn't that incentive to join our side? - Homer, I was never on your side! Look, you two started this game and now you want me to join in by committing totally piss fucking suicide. Well, I got a game for you. It's called go fuck yourself. And you can go fuck him, too, Moran. (door bangs shut) - I'm gonna suspend that little son of a bitch. - No, leave him alone. Can't you face it? He's right. We stuck him right in the middle. - Moran, I am sick and tired of listening to judgments from a burnout like you. Now, trying to save this school may seem like a worthless, hopeless job, but not to me. I'm gonna bust those Cobras, I'm gonna get them the hell out of my school, and if I have to sacrifice some basketball star, so be it. There are plenty of decent kids in this school who never did any harm to anybody. I'm on their side. You don't like that, go to hell. - [Man] Hannah, you narc! Who you been talking to? Time to die, Hannah! (laughing) (gun clicks) (Pooch laughing) (tense music) (tapping on window) - Excuse me. - I just got a bad feeling about this. - A bad feeling about what? - Ever since I left the gang, Cinco's had something to prove to himself. He ain't gonna leave this alone. - If you're trying to scare me, you're doing a terrific job. - I don't want to scare you. I just want you to know how things stand. - The cops have him. They have him locked up. What are you worried about? - I just get this feeling that somehow I'm unlucky. That somehow, my life is changed. It used to be going great, no surprises and normal. And now all this shit hits me! It sucks. - You're not unlucky. (dramatic music) Hi. - Hi, Sherry! I like the dress. - Thanks, I got it at the mall. - Yeah? Move it, Patch. - Thanks. - Forget it, I didn't do it for you. - What do you want? - You tell Jeff I need to talk to him in the Zero Club tonight. He knows the place. It's important. It's about Cinco. (school bell rings) (tense music) - Yo. - Jeff. - [Jeff] How you doing? - Listen up, man. You're a leader. You know without being told that Cinco is sick. He's in jail, he's getting out. He's got no reason to kill, but that doesn't bother him. Be prepared. - Be prepared? Be prepared? Look, if you think Cinco's such a lowlife, why don't you and the M-16's take him on, huh? I'm not a part of this shit anymore. (Jeff sighs) - They're telling everybody they're gonna kick your ass. See, I think we should get to them first. We should beat the living shit out of 'em. I mean, everybody is so afraid of the Cobras, but nobody has ever stood up to them. I mean, I think we could take 'em, man. - We should mess with the Cobras? - Yeah, if we got enough guys. - All right, suppose we do kick their ass. You think that's gonna be the end of it? That they're just gonna forget about it? - Well, they sure as shit ain't gonna come back for more, man. - Yeah, yeah, maybe not when we're together. How about when we're alone? - Oh, man, you're such a wuss. - Come on, man, I'm not afraid of fighting, I just don't want to see myself get severely messed up. Besides, there's other stuff to consider. - Oh, yeah, like what? - Like what it does to our records. A in gang wars. That's gonna look really neat on our college applications. - Yeah, well, what the hell are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to just sit around here and wait? I got more brains than this. (locker door bangs shut) I mean, Jim is right about one thing. These guys are not gonna fight with fair odds. They're gonna hit you when you're alone. Come on, what do you think? - I think that as long as they're talking about what they're gonna do, they're not gonna do anything. (switchblade clicks) - [Whitey] Hey, Jeff. I gotta fuck your girlfriend. Sherry, she's lookin' real good. You know what I'm saying? What are you gonna do about it, huh? You ain't gonna do nothing about it. 'Cause you're a pussy. Don't you think Sherry and I would look great together? Huh, fag? Huh? Come on, I can see you wanna do something to me, go on. Make a move. You scared of us, huh? You scared of us, Jeff? Huh? Huh? Come on. Come on, what are you gonna do? Huh? Huh? Come on, come on, come on, come on! Huh? What are you gonna do, huh? You ain't doing shit 'cause you a faggot. (laughs) Come on, let's go. (weight clangs) Hey, Normie! Hey, give me some of them nachos, huh? - Why do you put up with this shit, man? - I've put up with a lot. - Yeah, well, you should've kicked their ass then. - Did it ever occur to you that maybe the last thing we'd want is a fight? - Well, somebody should do it, man. - No one else will. - You see, even Norman's got more balls than you. - I don't believe this. I got a bunch of crazy killers on my hands. - [Chris] We're on your side, Jeff. - Where are you going? - Was it something he said? - Ooh! Hey, Sherry. I miss you, sweetheart. You know what I mean? How about a little blow job, huh? (loud slap) Fucking bitch! (tense music) (Whitey grunts) (tense music) - You can try anything you want on me, but if you ever touch her again, you're dead! (tense music) - Jeff! Let him go. Let him go. (Whitey panting) Let's go see Homer. - Let's not! - What the fuck you looking at? - Sherry, I don't want you here tomorrow. Cinco's probably gonna be out. I'm gonna have enough to worry about besides you. - Oh, really? Who else you gonna worry about? Lora? She wants to meet you at the club and talk about Cinco. - Are you jealous about Lora? I'm through with her. You know that. Don't start in about stuff that's nothing. - You're getting off on this gang shit, aren't you? I'm seeing the real you for the first time and I don't like it. - The real me? What are you, a shrink all of a sudden? I just saved your ass! Can't you get it up to thank me a little bit? - You saved my ass? It felt great hitting that guy, didn't it? You fed me all those lies, telling me that you wanted a normal life and something better. It was all a lie! - Hey, I am something better and I'm sure as shit not gonna let them or anyone else stop me from getting what I want! - How are you gonna get it if you're dead? - I'm not gonna die! I'm not gonna die. What do you expect me to do? What do you expect? I'll walk you to class. - No! I don't want you in my life anymore. I don't want you around, get it? - Man, I'm pissed! - What's up? - I've been down with Cinco for years, you know, I mean since time. - Yeah, so? - Yeah, so I do all the dirty work for the Cobras. I'm down on my knees for those assholes and Cinco goes for Lora. - Lora's cool. - What? She's a two-faced bitch. She's fuckin' Cinco and at the same time she's following Jeff around like a dog. - So what's the problem? - So I'm gonna get her. (hair whips) - You are so cool! - Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. That was a very funny gag you pulled with the mask. You know, that's what they give the little shitheads in the gang to do. That's how it works. They give you they garbage. Well, I got a message for you to give to Cinco, all right? You listening, shithead? Now, this rap on me that I'm a narc is bullshit. Now, I know it and Cinco knows it. Now, I want you to ask him if he wants to go to war with me over something we both know I didn't do, all right? (tense music) (ball bouncing) - Hiya, Coach. What's new? - What's new? What's new is I heard Horner tell the DA he can expect to make murder charges stick against the Cobras. He was even able to give them the name of the victim. It's you. - Nothing new here, Coach. (ball bouncing) - Quit bouncing the goddamn ball, Hannah. I mean, the funny thing is, Horner really cares about this school. He just figures he has to kill a few kids to save it. - I know about all that shit, Coach. You know, last week I figured if I could make 10 free throws in a row, I'd be ready to win. And last year when I ran with Cinco, if I could get through one night without hitting somebody, I figured everything would be just great. I can't go back to the Cobras. And there's nothing in your world to protect me. So I'm nowhere. Somehow I gotta get used to that. (ball bouncing) (loud rock music) - You better move along fast, quill head. (bottle shattering) (tires screeching) (loud rock music) - Members only, man, members only man, all right? No, you're a friend of nobody, man. Hey, don't give me that shit tonight, buddy! - I know you're a tough guy. - All right? - I know you're tough guy, I see you every night man. But you got a soft heart. (bottle shattering) (loud rock music) - [Man] Come on, buddy, come on. Chill out, chill out, all right? - You wanna get out of here? - I wouldn't mind. - All right, chill out, all right? - Where is that bitch? Go into the back. (car rumbling) - [Radio DJ] It's Stormin' Norman. This one goes out to Douglas. - You know, we could enjoy this. - What can you tell me? - You want me to help you, you help me. Come on, open me up. - No. This isn't gonna happen. Sorry. (car horn honking) Do you want to help or not? - Cinco got your message. - And? - He says you're dead. He says no excuses. If you try and run he's gonna find you and kill you, if you stay put he's gonna find you and kill you. Whatever happens, you're dead. And just for the fun of it, he's gonna get Sherry. Just so you know he means it. (motor rumbling) - All that time we ran together and it means nothing now. We saved each other's asses a million times. - He doesn't like people leaving him. It upsets him. - Yeah, I gave up on the Cobras. I got out and he can't stand it. (car horn honks) Thanks, Lora. Thanks. (loud rock music) (motor revving) (tense music) (motor revving) (tense music) - Hey. (tense music) - What's up? We've been looking for you. You better stop hanging out with your old boyfriend. I mean, we feel left out. (Lora grunts) (tense music) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - [Jeff] Hello, is Sherry there? - Uh, she doesn't want to speak to you and quite frankly, we're all delighted. - Put her on the phone, goddammit! It's important. - I don't think so. - I'll speak to him. I'll speak to him. - Hello, Jeff. - Sherry, listen to me, you're in a lot of deep shit. - I have nothing else to say to you. Please don't call me anymore. - Look, the Cobras are going after you tomorrow. You can't go to school. - Me? Why me? What did I do? - [Jeff] It's a way of getting at me. Just stay home and everything'll be all right. - I don't want to play this game. I'm not listening! - You've gotta listen. You've gotta listen! - Why are you dragging me into this? - What, is your mother standing over you telling you what to say? - This is not my mother, this is me. You promised. (dramatic music) - [Officer] (on radio) 431. 425. (dramatic music) - How was jail, boss? - Fuck jail. And fuck Jeff Hannah. He's gonna pay for this. Pass the word. The Cobras meet Hannah and his jock friends at the school at 3:15. Now shut up and drive. (motor revs) (van rumbles) (students chattering) - [Kid] Hey, Tommy! (students chattering) - [Homer] (on PA) As a result of today's half day, all Friday club and extracurricular activities have been canceled. School grounds will be looked as of one p-m-. That concludes today's announcements. (school bell rings) - Did you see her? - I was by the courts, she wasn't there. - I got to the front door, man, I didn't see her. - Did you look in her home room? - No. - Why not? - Why didn't you look at her home room, man? - Me? What would you blame it on me for? - [Teacher] "Summer by this sun of York "and all the clouds that lowered upon our house "in the deep bosom of the ocean buried. "Our stern alarms changed to merry meetings, "our dreadful marches to delightful measures. "Now is the winter of our discontent "made glorious summer by this sun of York." - What are you doing? What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be in class? - I have an important message for someone in here. - Well, if you have an important message you better come with me. (Jeff sighs) - Hey, I'm gonna go see Horner myself. (machinery rumbling) - You wanna fight? Even here, man. Look, I'll rip you open 'cause I don't give a fuck! Hey, Cinco says there's a time and a place for everything. The place is here at school. Now, you tell your friend Hannah, okay, tough guy? - Yeah, you just give me the time, man, we'll be there. - The time? (laughs) You'll find out later. (dramatic music) (machinery whirring) - Jeff, I told you she's safe in class. (telephone rings) - Yeah? Yes. Yes. Lora Benedict was beaten last night. - Do something. Now. Okay? Now. (dramatic music) (wailing siren approaching) (dramatic music) - "Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; "Our bruised arms hung up for monuments." (chain rattling) Sherry, you're wanted in the principal's office. (dramatic music) "And yet, she too is dismayed. "She is dispatched." (dramatic music) - [Patch] Get her! - Oh, no! - Cinco sends his love! - [Sherry] Oh, no! No, don't! No! (Sherry crashes into wall) (slap lands) - They jumped on me! (crying) (dramatic music) - [Sherry] Put me down! No! (dramatic music) Please! Don't! Oh! (Cobrette laughing) - Honey, you're a mess. (door crashes open) Let's get out of here! (dramatic music) (Sherry crying) (siren blaring nearby) - I heard from Smiley. They want the fight at school, but I didn't get a time. - I got a time. 15-. - You can count on me, man. - Hey, Jim if you don't want to be here, it's better you don't come. Nobody's proven anything here today anyway. - I don't think I can make it, Hannah. - Jesus, man, I knew it! (ambulance motor revving) (siren wailing) (trunk bangs shut) - Dr. Horner! I gotta talk to you a minute. We gotta do something about Hannah. Transfer the kid to another school. - I got a meeting with the goddamn school board in 15 minutes. We'll talk later. - Hey, don't you get it? Somebody's gonna get killed! - I'm late. (car door slams shut) (motor revs) (door clicks open) - Hi. - I was afraid you were mad at me. That you wouldn't come. - I'm not mad at you. - I look great, huh? - Yeah. - I look like shit. - Hey. It doesn't matter. - You gotta go soon and meet them and I can't stand it. - I can't either. But they went after Lora and then they went after you. I gotta put an end to it. If they kill you, how am I gonna deal with that? - Well, uh, when do you think she'll be released? - What are you doing? Your mother's right outside. - I don't care.
