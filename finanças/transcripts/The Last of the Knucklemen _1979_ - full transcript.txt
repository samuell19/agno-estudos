Jesus! Take the load off the bucket. Hey, Pansy, can you get the number five spanners? When were these teeth changed? Last week. They should've been replaced yesterday. Got those spanners, fella? Let that poofter university mate of his fetch his bloody spanners! Can you get us those spanners, fellas? It's the third time I've asked! They're in the shed with the wrecked rig. Well, get 'em! Now! Look, do I look like I'm scratching my bloody arse here? Get 'em yourself! You no-good bludger! You need your arse kicked! I'm not hearing too well. What's that you said? I said you're a no-good bludger and you need your arse kicked! Ahh! Ahh! Ohh! He's still out to it, Arthur. Well, you've done it this time, Pansy. Pack your things and hit the road. Hey, hang on, Arthur. The peanut asked for it. Come on, Arthur. None of us would've taken that shit. There's no point arguing. Pansy's out and that's all there is to it. Get your things together. I'll make up your pay right away. Pansy goes, I go! Me too! Well, that's up to you. It's up to all of us. So, you're all gonna stand down for Pansy? This'd never have happened if Tarzan had been here. I'll see you later. Beer, thanks. OK. So Tarzan's a tough old guy. He's ironed a few fellas out. So what? Tell you what I'll do, Carl. You put up $200, I'll give you 3 to 1. That's powerful betting. Real impressive stuff — 3 to 1. Well, what do you want? You reckon Tarzan's tough, right? He's been foreman at Black Creek for years, right? What are you worried about? Back your convictions. You rate me no chance so put it on the line! Say 10 to 1, say 20 to 1! But say something brave, for Christ's sake. Are punch-ups worth more than 3 to 1? Not in my book. Beer, Jack. What are you doing in town, Tarz? Ah, looking for a joker. Ah! So you're the famous Tarzan. I've been wanting to meet you. What for? You and me. I don't get hustled into a punch-up that easy, mate. I don't need to. Are you the bloke from Melbourne? Um... excuse me. Yeah? Did you say you were looking for someone from Melbourne? Vince Brown? Yes, yes, yes. Ah, right. Hey! Are you looking for work? I'm still two hands short. Doing what? Doing what you're bloody well told. That sort of stuff's alright if you're green and you've got things to prove. But when you know who you are and what you can do, you don't bother. Not unless there's stakes. I don't mean money. It's gotta be something that counts. Like my crew at Black Creek. Now there I'll always be a starter. But I'll only scrap in the town if the betting money's good enough. Not for kicks — not anymore. Hello, er, I'm Vince Brown. Take the bunks over there. Thanks, mate. Vince Brown. G'day, Vince. That's the story of my life. The wrong fight for the wrong reason at the wrong time. Yeah, what's the wrong reason? You, Pansy, that's the wrong reason. These two? Well, they're the unmade ones, right? There's this one here. You stay the side you are. And keep as much space between yourselves and me as you can. Why's that? 'Cause I stink. Am I wrong or am I all on my own here, eh? Cone on, don't be shy. I don't see anyone pulling out, Pansy. Everyone there at the start's still here now. Yeah, well, Tarzan doesn't worry me. And if I were you, Pansy, I'd say that as often as I could in the next few minutes! While you can. Hey! How about we open a book on how the big fella's gonna react? I'll give you evens we're all still in work here tomorrow morning. Any takers? Great bloody sportsmen. Whose next shout is it? It's between you and Methuselah. Eh? You'll toss for it. Call it, Methuselah. No, my luck's no good. Take my cans. Come on, put a bit of suspense into it. Take a chance! I lose all the time. Calls himself a bloody gambler. Crazy for a spin, but I'll tell you what I'll do — I'll give you 2 to 1. Now call. Heads! Tough. Oh, why do I keep doing it? Hey, Horse. Tassie. Mad Dog. Methuselah? Oh, no, I can't afford to buy myself one now, mate. Hey, what's your name? Tom. Oi! Thanks. Are we gonna play cards or are we gonna stuff about? Can't play on an empty stomach. I'm old-fashioned, Mad Dog. When there's money at stake, I like to be serious. Hey, what's your name? Tom, mate. Have a bo-peep out the window, will ya? See if there's any sign of the big fella. Who's that? Well, Tarzan. The big turd who thinks he can walk on water. - Ah, forget it. - Ah, don't be like that. We've got lousy cards, that's all. Garbage! I'll go with half a dollar. I'm out. How can you throw in before you're dealt again? You've gotta have something to build on, don't you? You could pick up four of a kind. And pigs might fly! You have to go for the long shot sometimes, my friend. That's what gambling's all about. Why don't you stick to playing your hand, alright? Leave us to play ours? He's on his way. Bets are off! No, they are not. Sit down. We're not gonna be sitting around here like a bunch of frightened schoolgirls. Speak for yourself. How many? I'm out! Horse? Two. Give me three. We've got nothing to worry about. It's moments like these I thank Christ I'm old! I can sit on me bum, twiddle me thumbs and watch it all happen! You mongrel! What have you got to say for yourself, fat mouth? He asked for it, Tarz. Not asking you! We were there, Tarz. We saw it. Shut up! The mouth hit him. Let the mouth tell me why. I'm not letting a prick like that shout at me. Not here, not anywhere. And that's my right. Your right? Who the bloody hell do you think you are? Me, Tarzan. ME! And that makes you something special? My bloody oath, to me it does. You want me to go right through you, mate, you're doing everything just perfect. Well, maybe you could, Tarz. I'm not saying you could... ...I'm saying maybe. Right! Let me put the lot of you straight. Number one — Assaulting anyone for any reason during a shift at work warrants instant dismissal. No exceptions. No ifs or buts. Out! On the spot. And if it'd happened while I'd been here, fat mouth, your feet would never have touched the ground! Number two... If there'd been any of this bullshit about all for one and one for all, the rest of youse would've been booted down the road right after him. This isn't General Motors! You're day labourers on a wildcat mine, which means you're paid to jump when you're told to jump and run when you're told to run. Nobody's asking you to fall in love with the work. You're here because it suits ya! Nobody asks you any awkward questions. Nobody tries to find out what the hell it is you're running from. You can stay or you can go. That's it. And if that's not enough rights, then get the fuck off of here before I bounce you off. Number three... ...this little turn you've stacked on has put my job on the line. I'm paid to sort youse bastards out. So, BE TOLD! Youse will all be out there tomorrow morning just like any other day. RIGHT? Yeah, right. You, er, fellas got everything? Yeah, we're right, thanks. Ah, fine, fine. You jokers have gotta take a big tumble to yourselves. Our leader's not too pleased with us. Not too damned pleased at all. Guide her in. She's in my side. How's she looking? Right. Right. Whoa! In the old days when I first came north, there were some real hard bastards about. Wild men. When they went on the piss, anything was likely to happen. And that's when you needed the knucklemen. To sort the bastards out before they broke up everything within sight. Ahh, there was never anyone better with his knuckles than old Tarz. Ah, it doesn't matter. You get called what you wanna get called. Or what it suits you to get called. Like Tassie, 'cause he's from Tasmania. Or Methuselah 'cause he's an old bastard. But why not Vince or Tom or whatever your name really is? I thought you said you taught in schools! Correct. Well, how come you're so bloody dumb? What, haven't you done anything else? Well, I was in a monastery. A what? A monastery. Whoo ho! A monastery! Whoo ho! A monastery! Ha ha! Oh, you ripper! Let's go! Ahh! Hey. Is that right? You were a monk? Well, I didn't take final vows. After six years, I found I didn't have a vocation. Six years, eh? You swallowed all that voodoo stuff? Well, I left. To work in a godforsaken hole like this! Eh! I've never met a monk before! I'm not a monk. You'll do me for one, sport! Phwoah! In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctus! Hey — Vince, a monk! The health of Monk! To the health of Monk! You gonna risk it? Well, I'm hungry enough to be game. You gotta be game to tackle this shit. And very hungry. Oh, it's not that bad. Belt it down you. That's the secret. Yeah, don't worry if you chuck it up. If you lose it, we'll drag that wog bastard over to clean up. We still gotta tag YOU with a name. I'm just Tom. Well, that's all I'll answer to. Oh, I love these mystery men. They're me favourites. I'll bet you don't even wanna tell us about yourself. There's nothing to tell. You know what breaks me up? Horse calling the cook a wog. Well, that's what he is. - And what does that make you? - Shut up, Pansy. No, I want him to tell me what he is. A bloody Australian, that's what! Hey, Tom. Ever seen an Australian with skin that colour? He looks alright to me. He looks alright to all of us, Pansy. Has anyone told you lately that you're an ignorant old shit? I've been called more names than you could ever remember, sport. And name-callers don't bother me. They're nothings. Nobodies. It's a whole world full of nobodies these days. You'd fall over with shock if you met a really interesting man. Such as who? Well, people who have done something, made their mark. Made their bloody mark? Got themselves off the hook. Off the treadmill. Like who? Who? Well, like, um... like, er... How the hell do I know who? Like that fella that bluffed half a million out of Qantas. Yeah, but the bastard got caught. Ah, but he had a go. Hey, what about the karate pilot knocked off the payroll last week? Eh? Didn't hear about that. This guy's unreal. He's walked into police headquarters. The big one in the city. It's crawling with cops. So he's had a quiet stroll down the corridor, see? Cool as a cucumber, straight into the pay room. There's three wallopers there making up the pays, right? And it's like the roof fell in. He's flattened them like tacks. He's taken their best punches laughing then showed them where they went wrong. Then he's ambled out with quarter of a million bucks under his arm. He's left the whole police force with the proverbial egg dripping off their faces. Well, that's what I mean. Someone like that would be worth meeting. He's made it, he's set for life and he's laughing. Yeah. Yeah, Methuselah's right, you know. He's the only big-timer we got here. Eh? Tell the boys about the time you won the Australian cycling championship back in 1901 or something. I didn't win the bloody thing, Horse. I came third. I never, ever said I won the bastard. Yeah, but you heard the roar of the crowd, didn't you? And liked it. Heady stuff, wasn't it, you old bastard? All I ever said was I came third. Half a spoke behind the winner. He's got his name in the record books, though. And... and... and... he's got a photo to prove it. Hey, why don't you go and get your photo? Go on, Methuselah. Go on. Flash your photo. Come on. Flash the photo. Ah, go on. Get stuffed. Youse bastards want any seconds or do I put the food away? You got a hide to call this muck food. One more minute and I put it away. Oh, go back to Budapest, you peasant. Yah! Hey, listen, Monk, you gotta eat. Yeah, Monk. If you don't eat, you don't shit. And if you don't shit, you die. OK. I don't know. What do you reckon? About another 20 feet would do it. Hey, Monk? Close her up. Watch yourself there — She comes across. Not on there, you clown. On the T-bar. Thanks, Pansy. What about the catch? The catch?! Thanks. Will you do me a favour? Cut out the thanks bullshit, alright? It's not a please and thank you outfit, right? Sorry. And don't be sorry, for Christ's sake! Oh, knock it off, Pansy. What? I said knock it off. Don't get cocky that Tarzan didn't lay you out because I might just save him the fucking trouble. Yeah, you and who else? I wouldn't need anyone else. Let's see if you fight as well as you shoot your mouth off, you wog bastard. Cut it out, you pair of morons. Knock it off! I'll... I'll fix you, wog. Let me at him! Let me at him! That's bloody Pansy again. Come on. Let me have one swing. He won't come back for more. Yeah, we'll see who won't come back for more. Come on. Let him go. Come on! Let him go! Well, well, well. What have we got here? Little bit of friction? Oh, don't let me stop anything. I like a good punch-up. But you better put money on it because it'll cost you your jobs. Good punch-up? Since when do wogs go the distance with anyone? Tell him to stop calling me a wog or I'll knock his bloody block off! I'm getting worried about this outfit. In particular, one man. Makes me wonder what sort of future that man's got on my crew. Oh, you just want me out. About you I don't give a damn. Five minutes after you walk down that road, I won't even remember you've been alive. That's how much you count to me. But peace on the job, that counts. Now, get back to work, the lot of you. Hey, Monk. Our Tarz's getting quite a reputation as a peacemaker these days, isn't he? I don't get you, mate. Ah, it's probably all bullshit. You know, the way that these, er... What? The trouble he had in the Andamooka. What trouble? Look, when we go to town we're getting rubbished about something between Tarz and that Hun from the copper drilling outfit. What's his name? Er... Carl. Yeah? Yeah, it seems that, er, Tarz and him had a few words in the Andamooka. Little misunderstanding. The way the fellas tell it, our Tarz sort of, er, crawled down. Just an option I didn't care to take. That's all. That's your story. That's me story. And, er, you don't care what they say? Not unless there's dough in it. They put their money where their mouths are, I might. How much money? Enough. You and your mates will have to win me around to the idea. Tempt me. And you'll match it? Dollar for dollar? And cent for cent. Right down the line. Winner take all. But in your case, sweetheart, there wouldn't have to be any money. That'd be my pleasure. Any time you fancy. Well, that's your put-down for the day, Pansy. Don't feel put down at all. Oh. Then you're lucky you were born dumb. What the hell's going on? Another nightmare. He has them all the time. Oh, I can't talk without me teeth in. Are you alright, Mad Dog? Can, er... ...do anything for you? Yeah. Bugger off. You're sweating. I'll get you a towel. That scared the shit out of me. Our heroes worry about things that go bump in the night. Very edgy men. In the dark, they can't hide behind the hair on their chests anymore. This'll cool you down, Mad Dog. Make you feel... Will you fuck off, Monk? We don't need no Florence Nightingales here. Just fuck off or I'll jam that towel right up your arse. Charming. Can't we have quiet, for Christ's sakes?! Don't yell in me ear, you mongrel bastard, Horse! You'll go through the wall the next time. Yeah, that'll be the day. Let me know when you're ready to try. Just have a bit of consideration for people trying to sleep! You want me to sing you a fucking lullaby or something? They kill me. They really break me up. - They ought to be on at the Tivoli. - There's no Tivoli anymore. Well, wherever they have comedians, then. That's where you idiots ought to be. Give me that towel, will you, Monk? I'll wet it again for you. No, just as it is. Don't fuss. You're too much, Monk. Sometimes I think you're from another planet. Nothing worse than being sweaty. No. Plenty of things are worse, Monk. Plenty. Hey. Listen. There are always planes out there in the night. Well, they give me the shits. They make me remember I'm stuck up here rotting. Then why don't you go back to the city? You try being a cripple some day, fella. Great job opportunities. You could spend the rest of your life driving a lift. You're still breathing, Mad Dog. It don't matter you're short of an arm or a leg. Or even your cock. So long as you're breathing. It's alright for you, you old bastard. You've had — what?... 60 good years with two arms and two legs. To me that rates as a fair innings. Oh, wait and see, fella. I used to think I wouldn't want to go on living without being able to root. Oh, shit. But in time your balls stop being the centre of the universe. You adjust. I've asked you bastards! Asked youse nice to be quiet. Now I'm telling youse. Shut your faces or I'm gonna start kicking arses round the floor. Sick men or well men, one-legged men or two-legged men! We thought you was asleep, Horse. Dreaming of the thrills you could give some little tart with that great dong of yours. I kept telling meself I wasn't gonna get upset. But it doesn't work. Because I am upset! I am fucking ropeable! So I'm telling youse for the last time, shut your faces and let me get me sleep! Give you the world, the old Horse, you know. Underneath all that crappy wog shit he goes on with, there's a heart as big as a bucket. I'm not fooling, Mad Dog! I got a right to sleep and if it means making a bastard of meself, I'll make a bloody bastard of meself! On two legs I'd do you like a dinner. Even on one I wouldn't write meself off. Oh, forget it, Mad Dog. Horse'd mostly likely club you to death with that great dong of his. I speak what I say! Don't try me! Can I say one thing before I go to sleep, Horse? Just one last thing, right? What?! This is for you, Horsey. For you alone, mate. Get stuffed, you wog bastard! Hey, Tarz?! Yeah? She's going. Two minutes to go! I'm on my way up. Righto. Oi. Methuselah? Hey, Methuselah, you alright?! What's that stupid bloody idiot up to? Hey, Methuselah?! Holy shit! Back! Block and tackle! Hey, you all in one piece? I think so. Oh, shit, mate. I'm sorry, Tarz. Try and make it a little bit closer next time, eh? Right on the doorstep if I can. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Oh! Thinking it'd pass, like it usually does. But by the time I knew it wouldn't, I was out. You should be in hospital. You know that, don't you? No more hospitals. While there's a chance they can do something for you, alright. But not when it's the crunch. There's no point then. And they're lousy places to die in. There's nobody here. No, no. Here I'm a nuisance. I'm not worth a day's pay a week. I'm lucky Tarzan doesn't give me the arse out of the joint. But... when you're old... ...you accept being a nuisance. It's your right. And you enjoy it... ...in a weird kind of way. Yeah, I can understand that. But why do you stay in this heat? Miles from any kind of real help? I'm waiting. For what? Ahh. The time to go. What makes later so different to now? Now's not right. Look, I've got no spare chances. When I go to that door, there's no way back. That's it. And I'll be on the first plane to the big smoke. I'll take a room in one of them swanky pubs. You know, with coloured telly and hot and cold air blowing all over you and everything you want. And I'll have me tea at 9:00 at night if I want it. And I'll have it sent up on a tray. I mean... ...I've got 3,000 bucks salted away. Well, it's... no fortune but... ...what I've got's for me. To stretch for as long as it'll last. And I'll take cabs everywhere I go. I'll study the form and on Saturdays I'll punt. Not big stuff, not like Pansy. No. But I've got a... ...a system... worked out that ought to cover me tabs. Oh, for a while at least. That's why the... time's gotta be right. The luck's gotta be with me. 'Cause with just a little run of luck, I ought to be able to make it a soft ride home. First class. All the way. I'll raise you five. I've forgotten what a pair looks like. I'm beginning to think you're pulling our noses, Pansy. Well, there's one way to find out. Nah. Not for five bucks. Not with what I've got. Seeing as how I'm a nice fella, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you two to one, $20 to $10. Lost your girlfriend, mate? Geez, I'd love to see someone take him down. Well, you can't go anywhere with that. Nah. It's all yours. I get me a run of luck and no bastard's got anything. Break your bloody heart. You're collecting. What more do you want? This? Be happy with this? Cigar money. Phew! That'll do. Don't you ever get tired? Much longer up here, you'll start to be a dangerous man. You know, I'd have reckoned you'd have been a gambling man, Tarz. Nah. Bunch of whackers. Never seen a sane gambler yet. Oh, you've seen every fucking thing, wise man, haven't you? Just about. Openers. She's away. Give me three. One. Horse! Er, oh, give me two. Go for broke. Sure you got the energy to pick them up? And two for the dealer. OK, she's away and running. Who's gonna take on Pansy? Bullshit. Not me. I'm out. Well, I wouldn't say I was without a sporting chance. That means he's got something. So the old fox has got something. Maybe. 10 bucks worth, maybe? Yeah, you're pushing it bit, ain't you? Why don't you give me two to one, same as you did to Horse? 'Cause I smell something. Well, what would you say if I was to, er... up it to... ...207 I'd say I'm interested. So I'll, er... up it... .to 20. Piss off, Monk. And what if I up it to 40? Do you? I don't feel I've been bluffed out again, fat mouth. You've got your hand to play. Well, I'm gonna see what you're made of. I'm upping it to, er... ...100. Let's see the money on the table. Causing me quite a problem, Methuselah. Quite a problem. I reckoned I might. Well, you fellas know how I hate weak bets, right? So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm making it 200. How does that grab you? Well, I don't have 200 on me. If you say you can cover it, it's OK. He hasn't got 200 on him, Pansy. No, shut up, Horse. You'll take an IOU? For as high as you want to go. Then I'll say, er... ...300. I gotta keep raising you, Methuselah. It's on the nod for me too. OK? Sure. 400. On the nose. That's ridiculous. Are you both out of your minds? Come on, Methuselah, you can't risk this sort of money. You're trying to bluff me out. There's money on the table, Methuselah. That's what it's all about. And you reckon you're gonna win it. Well, I've won some and I've lost some. I'm gonna win or lose this. Maybe you're unbeatable. I don't know. You must be strong otherwise you wouldn't be into this sort of money. But I'm not getting shaken off either. So I'm saying 400. Maybe I'll get tossed. But I like the heat in the kitchen. 500. - Christ. - Mad, you bastards. This has gotta stop! Have you got any idea how much I've put on a horse? I don't care how much you put on. This is here and now. And I'm not having this sort of money bet between friends. Friends? That's rich. You and me friends, Tarz? Would you rate us as friends? What about Methuselah? Is he my friend? What would Methuselah do for me, eh? Horse? Tassie? Mad Dog? Don't give that 'friends' bullshit, for Christ's sake. We live together. Yeah, we live together, we eat together and we crap together. So what? You said yourself five minutes after I walk out of this place you wouldn't remember I'd even been alive. That goes for all of us. Who'd give a damn if Tassie got mashed by one of those ground gobblers, eh? We'd all say, “Too bad. Tough shit. Poor old Tass.” And everything would go rolling right on. One thing I've learned in this world, fella, look after number one first, last and always. I'm saying these bets are too high for people who have got to live together. Too high for you, Tarz. So you be glad you're out of it. But between two old gamblers like us, it's as good as it gets. 1,000. Bets are off. Get your fucking hands off! Keep out of what's not your business. This is my business. People kill for big money. I'm not having it here. You don't own us, Tarzan. It's none of your fucking business. My job's keeping this outfit running, not letting mad bastards like youse bust it wide open. It's not your decision. It's our brass, we're risking it in our own time and there's no law against it! Have you got rocks in your head or what, you stupid old idiot?! Oh, do what you like with your fucking money! But don't come running to me later or I'll kick you out me bloody door! You bid... ...1,0007? That's right. Then I'll say 2,000. You got that much? I've got three. Then that's what I'll up it to. I'll see you... ...for 3,000. For $3,000? 3,000. We've all got that clear, have we? The wager's $3,000. I've never, ever seen one before. I've only seen one. That makes two. I've been playing cards for more than 40 years and I've never, ever seen one on the table before. Came along as sweet as you like. I threw two away. See, I was hoping for a run or a flush. Never dreamed that this would come up. But there it was... ...in the claw. What'd it beat? - Four big boys. - Kings. Jesus. I would have pushed it higher. You can't push higher than what you've got to lose, Pansy. What sort of odds against getting done with that? But that's what I mean. With four big ones in the claw, sky's the limit. I'd have hocked my life on it. Methuselah, about the money. What do you say we go into town tomorrow and settle up, huh? How do you plan on getting to town? Well, I could ask for a loan of the Willies. What if I don't say yes? Then we walk. You'd make the old man walk? Sure. I'd carry him on my back. But then we'd get a lift. Someone always comes along sooner or later. Just a question of waiting. Take the Land Rover and go in early and get all this shit over with and, while you're in there, check the mail. Anything else? Just this. Thank you, sir. It's better to fix these things up while they're still fresh, Methuselah. It takes the sweat out of it, eh? There's no sweat, Pansy. G'day, Marge. How're you going? Good. And you? Oh, me? No worries. Ta. Hooroo. Hey, do you see what I see? Coming up. Alright. Did you get that, mate? Yeah. Good man. Hey, Horse. You could handle a lube job, couldn't you? Are you fair dinkum?! Right on. Yippee! Hey, let it go. The whores are in town! Let me down! Come on. Let us down. From home? Yeah, it's from me little boy. I thought you was an alimony dodger. Whores, Monk! $40 a throw. Or $60 if you want something special that's gotta be whispered in their ear. Let's shift ourselves, for Christ's sake. We'll be stuck on the end of the bloody queue again! Once the word gets around, there'll be every stud for miles about pouring into town. Hah, yeah, I prefer other ways too, Tassie, but a few years up here makes you real unfussy. Oh, ho, ho, ho! I wanna go. I wanna go. I... want... to... go! What truck we taking? The Willies. Tarzan's checking if the engineers will be in it. Is that bastard going? Nuh. He makes sure he doesn't front up in town anymore, eh? He's not one for the whores these days. I don't mean the whores. I mean front at the Andamooka. Yeah, well, that's his business. Those women, they're like polecats by the time you get to them. Well, who's forcing you? Stay home. Forget it. Count the flies on the bloody wall. Come on, you bastards! I'm getting my balls knotted waiting. What's the hold up?! Come on, Horse, move your arse. OK, then. Let's move it. Hey, you coming, Monky? Nah. Nah, I don't think so. Oh, do you good, Monk. You look as if you need a bit. I'm alright. Oh, a good strong woman would ginger you right up. Hey, tell us something on the level, Monk. You ever cracked it? Hey, come on, Monk. Give over. You've never cracked it, have you? Oh, ease up, Pansy. Frightened of it, Monk, are you? - Get... get off me, Pansy. - Come on, Pansy. I wanna know why you don't want it, Monk. Haven't you got them? Oh, Pansy! Leave him alone. What did you say? I said leave him alone. He's talking to me. Come on, Pansy. Let me go. Make me. I should go through you now. Hurry up, you bastards! I'll bloody well leave without you! But you'll keep... .'cause I got better things to do in town tonight. But you got something coming to you for that, fella. Well, we are off. Can't keep the pussy waiting. Oh! Oh, Jesus! Me hat, me hat. Come on, Horse! You need your head read, Horse. Those women are revolting. Yeah? Well, why have you shaved if you're not a starter? Huh? Yeah, we're coming, we're coming! Niceties you've got to do without. Oh, come on. Be in it! Come on, you bastards! Oh, Jesus, me dough, me dough. Christ, can't get a fuck without some money. Yeah, hold it! Hold it! Coming! Take it easy, Horse. You'll lose it all in your strides. Oh, don't worry, Methuselah. I've got plenty. Come on! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Go on, Mad Dog! I'm coming! I'm gonna be in it! Wait for me, you bastards! Wait for me, you bastards! Come on! You can do it, son! Come on! Jesus, 40-odd blokes and only three birds. It's gonna be another two hours. No, it won't take that long. Er, how do you get, mate? 20 minutes. If you can't make it in 20 minutes, you're in love. How about we go down the boozer till this thins out? Not me, mate. Mad Dog? No way. Alright, save us a place, will you?

Ah. My friend from the Black Creek outfit. Give us a stubbie, will ya? How did you get on with the famous Tarzan? Think he'll come at it? It's not whether he'll come at it. It's whether you'll come at it now. What are you talking about? I've got a change of plan. That's alright by me if there's still some money in it. Oh, there's plenty of money in it, Carl... for both of us. Who's in the chair? Me. Me. It's my shout. I'll get 'em. The Monk is becoming a pisspot. 'Becoming'?! The Monk is pissed! I have never accused of being pissed in my life. Yeah... I'm a gambler. Funny thing, though... ...I dunno whether that means that money means everything to me... ...or money means nothing to me. Money means nothing to you. How would you know? You're not a gambling man. Just 'cause I don't play poker, Methuselah, doesn't mean I'm not a gambler. Money is the root of all evil. I'm not sure, but... ...you just might be an interesting man. Thanks, Methuselah. The ROOT... 40, eh? What do you get for the extra 20? Only one way to find out. Reckon it's worth it? You'd be the judge of that. Oh, I think I'll have it, ah... ...oysters. Oysters? Au naturel. It's only $60... and I like it with all the trimmings. 'Trimmings'?! Listen, mate, that sort of stuff might go down well in Budapest, but I was brought up in Tasmania. Bugger Tasmania! Bugger you too, pal! Come in. G'day. You, er... haven't... ...got anything, have you? What do you mean?! Well, you know. Listen, you're less likely to pick up something off one of us than off any of your bloody amateurs. Yeah. 10... 20... 30... ...40... ...and 20... ...makes 60. Well! Good evening! Hey, Panse, better get your arse into gear! Horse is into seconds. Rosie right? Nah, she's still got a customer, I think. Don't let the side down, Pansy. Hope you're not too pissed to crack it! That'll be the day. Hey, whoa, ya big bastard! Whoa, hold on! Hey! How's youse buggers?! Hey, Horse, you know... ...you're not a bad bastard, for a wog. You're the only man I'd let say that, I can tell you that! Hey! I want you to cover for us. Shh! Shut the door! Quietly! Shh! I think we need a drink. Shh! Shut up, you bastards! Let a man sleep! Shh! Let a man sleep! You've got to be joking! You've got to pay me more money! We're talking 25. I need to stake the second claim. Your share will be worth three times the normal price. I want 750. 600. That's as far as I'll go. Take it or leave it. Drinks are on me. No, they're not — They're on the fucking floor! We're trying to sleep! It's five o'clock in the morning! Lay your ears back, boys, and knock 'em down. Here, Carl. Get that into ya. We've got a right to sleep. Well, stuff you and your sleep! You'll have all the time in the world to sleep soon enough. And spray the air, for Christ's sake! Ah! Fuck the lot o' youse! Oh, don't be like that, Tas! Well, I'm drinking to Carl! Best of luck to ya, Carl! You'll do me, boy! Where's Tarzan? Hey, Pansy... Oh! What's this oaf doing here? You'll see. Just stick around. You'll see. He's the Hun, isn't he? Where is Tarzan? Try and find out. Hey, Pansy... ...is that the other guy we're looking for? Monk. Hey, Monk! Hmm? Where's Tom? I think he's over at the, uh... ...the engineer's hut, with Tarz. We'll get him now. Tarzan's got no quarrel with you! Stay out of something that's none of your business! He's got no argument with you! You lousy kraut! Ah! You're wasting your breath, Methuselah. He's doing it for money. Hey, Tarzan! Get outta there! I wanna see you! We're turnin' on a surprise party for ya, Tarz! What the bloody hell do you think you're doin'?! I want a word with you. Over at the bunkhouse. I'll give you more than a word, mate. Whose money, Horse? Just sit back and enjoy the show. OK... let's clear these fuckin' chairs! I'm going to murder this motherfucker! What's going on? Nothing, Monk. Just two fellas who've had it coming to them for a long time are gonna collect. So what's the bloody commotion?! You're on private property, mate. You better get off, quick smart! You wanna make me? Try and make me. You're trespassing, mate. You know why I'm here? I can guess. He's put up $600 for me to fight you, arsehole! But that can keep. My first fight's with him. With HIM?! Yeah! You see, he's worth more than $600. Real vintage Pansy. So you'd turn him in, you bastard?! Well, $3,000's $3,000, Methuselah. You should know that. What's goin' on?! You! Out! Huh! Sure you got the right guy? Yeah. It's Goldilocks. Hey, Tarz! If you're not back in two minutes, we'll know you've eloped. Sorted it out, have you? Yeah. Now I'm gonna sort youse bastards out. I'll bounce you and your Hun buddy right off this turf. I'll bounce you down that road so hard, youse'll never wanna see or hear of me again, not all your fuckin' days! Just hold on a second, Tarz. Get outta me way or I'll do you first, then him! I don't care which fights first, but we've got business to set up. No bets. You like fighting for stakes, don't you, Tarz? No bets, Pansy! Couple hundred dollars? Come on, name it. No bets! You're stuffed, Pansy! What is this? You said you'd fight for stakes. We all heard you say it, right here! I fight for stakes, but here it's not dough. Here, I fight to survive, mate. This here's my stake, under me! Me turf! And I'd fuckin' die for it, mate! Win or lose, fat mouth, this night you're not gonna forget! Come on! I'll break every bloody bone! Wait a minute! Get outta me way! Just let me speak! Outta me way! I'm tr yin' to fight a man! Give me a second! Let him speak, Tarz! What?! I'll fight the bastard. Oh, you're wastin' me time! I'll back myself against him! You wanna kill yourself, do it some place else. This is MY fight! No, Tarz. Pansy's your fight. But this bastard's mine. Alright. We'll try it your way. Just hold your horses! It cost me $600 to promote these fights. I was gonna offer Tarz at two to one, and even money to Hun, but I'm gonna be real generous. I'm offering Tom at five to one. Any takers? I'll, uh... put $300 on Tom. Methuselah — take the dough. Ah, the Hun'll win. The bastard's built like a brick shithouse! Couldn't drop him with a chainsaw! Here, Panse, I'll have 200 crispies on the Hun. Yeah — I'll go along with that too. How about you, Tas? I ain't bettin'. I know who I'd rather see win, shithead. How about you, Goldilocks? Wanna put some money where your mouth is? Why not? Five to one, you reckon, Pansy? Yep. You can cover $600? Sure. Hang onto this. There's three grand there, Methuselah. The other $1,500's on the nod, OK? OK, let 'em go! All in and last man standing. Arggh! Oh, yeah. You son of a bastard! Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Fight like a man, arsehole! Ugh! Ugh! And another one! Keep your distance, for Christ's sake! Arggh! Ugh! Arggh! Arggh! ARGGH! Ugh! Ugh! Carl! Come on! Carl! Get up! We've got money on this, Carl! Get up! Get up and fight! Carl! There's a lot of money on this! Get up, you kraut bastard! GET UP! That's my boy! That's it, Carl! Get into it! Sonofabitch! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Belt him with a bar, Carl! Hit him with a bar! Belt him! UGH! Come on, you can win, big fella! That's the boy, Tommy! Come on! Shit! He's fucked. Mail plane leaves at 8:00. I'll get the keys to the Land Rover. Monk can drive you. Hey, uh... Tom... . mate... ...me and the boys have been talkin', and, uh... ...it'd be alright for you to stay here. We'll fix Pansy, no worries. Thanks, Horse, but, uh... but no, thanks. Excuse me, Mr Tom... ...you'd be better off here with people you know than you ever would be on the run, wouldn't he, Horse? Yeah, right, right, right! I'll see you, Mad Dog. Tas. Well... here's your stake. And here's your winnings. No, you keep that. For your soft ride home. I'm a bit above charity, mate. Then I'll tell you what I'll do, Methuselah. I'll toss you for it. Call. Heads. It's yours. He never even showed me the bastard! Well, you're full of surprises, aren't you, hey? Better move on to Darwin real fast. I'd come with you, but, uh... I got a score to settle with someone. You give him one for me. Alright, you mongrel. Outside. You've had this comin' for a long time. Ugh! Smash the bastard! Ugh! Give him the old one-two, Tarz! Arggh! Wanna lay $500 on yourself, Panse? I'll give you $2! Arggh! Use the hook! Ugh! Go him, knuckleman! Go! Go!
