Leaving the city and coming here to Christmas Cove has really opened my eyes. Gave me the confidence to go for what I want. And what I really want is you. You know that I've always loved you. Merry Christmas. Hi, sis. What an endless day. I had back-to-back meetings till 4:00, and then... - Are you crying? - What? No. You are. Christmas In Christmas Cove. Again? It's my favorite. Huh. Well, this and every other Christmas movie. Isn't it the same guy from A Very Christmas Wedding? Chad Matthew Monroe. It should be a crime to be that handsome. - What are you working on? - I thought... I'd get started on our next big project. Spring Fling. Actually, we haven't even started working on it yet. I just had a few ideas and I wanted to get them on the page. So you did all this work for fun? Well, I'm hoping Mr. Peterson loves it so much, he lets me lead the project. Mr. Peterson. Mr. Peterson who thinks your name is Elle? He does not. It's a nickname. I don't see why you put up with him. If I were you, I'd walk right up to him, look him in the eye and say... - Mr. Peterson! - Right, but then... Mr. Peterson, you remember my sister, Lacy? - No. - Oh. Have you finished proofing the end-of-the-year press release? Actually, I've been working on something else. I need the revised draft press release, ASAP. - I want to get it out today. - Yup. Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. And you should get that fixed. Thank you, Sir. Merry Christmas! Does he even know you do design work? Of course. I mean, I'm sure he remembers. Probably. I... Maybe I should remind him. Come on, let's go. I've got to get ready for a date. - On Christmas Eve? - Yeah. - He's in finance. - Oh. We're so lucky to live in Christmas Cove. It's like a warm cup of cocoa. Holly, please, a warm cup of cocoa isn't nearly as sweet as you... Huh. Oh, come on. Hey! How was it? It wasn't. He didn't show up, didn't answer my texts. - I was totally ghosted. - What? Lacy, why do you keep wasting your time on these losers who stand you up? Oh, by now it's a warm, familiar feeling. Which is more than I can say for our apartment. Did they say when the heat would be fixed? Sometime next week. If we haven't frozen to death by then. How many times are you planning to watch this movie? - Shh. - And what I really want is you. Can I ask why it looks like a pack of toddlers tried to make Christmas cookies in here? Because I tried to bake Christmas cookies in there. Ss... Oh. I don't get it. Design is so easy on the page, but in real life... Join the club. I'm used to men who don't turn out like the package promised. Ah! What are you doing? I wanna watch some true crime. That will make me feel better. Wait. Return To Christmas Cove is starting. Return To Christmas Cove? The one where they return to Christmas Cove. Spoiler alert. - Fine. I'll watch upstairs. - Ah! You can't. I'm DVR-ing the 12 Cats Of Christmas. It's a Yuletide classic! Eve, you can't spend the entire month of December in front of the TV. I have years of experience that say I can. I have an idea. Why don't we go get some hot chocolate? We can look at the lights. What are you talking about? We have lights right here. Oh. Let me get my purse. I honestly don't know if I can take one more Christmas movie. What are you talking about? Everyone loves Christmas movies! They're heartwarming and sweet... And predictable. They meet, they fall in love. It snows. - The end. - Don't be such a scrinch. - A scrinch? - Scrooge plus Grinch. Scrinch. - Life isn't a Christmas movie. - But why can't it be? I'd be so good in a Christmas movie. I'm quirky, yet lovable... Hopeless, yet adorable. You know, you could use a Christmas movie. Warm that cold, cold heart. It's not a cold heart, Eve. - It's just a worried one. - What do you mean? It's almost like, like you're hiding away from real life. Well, maybe I am. I mean, look at us, Lacy. We're both single, we live in an apartment we can barely afford where we have to go outside to get warm. My boss doesn't know my name or what I do. My cookies are burnt. - And you... - What about me? Your love life, for starters, pretty sure you've dated every jerk in this city. True. But new ones move in every day. I just wish we could have a perfect Christmas, you know? Like, like, in a Christmas movie. With beautiful decorations, and a grandma who cooks, a handsome beau... Is that what you really want? More than anything. Can you handle that, Santa? Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! And how about you, young lady? Me? I don't want anything. Oh, everyone wants something for Christmas. What'd you wish for? He's Santa. He'll figure it out. Doesn't need me to spell it out. Merry Christmas, Santa. Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! I think we've burnt this thing out. Leaving the city and returning to Christmas Cove has really opened my eyes... again. Hm? Hm. What's going on? Where are we? I don't know. Wait, did you go to bed with your hair and makeup done? Did you go to bed with your hair and makeup done? Oh. Did someone kidnap us? Are we trapped here? # We wish you a Merry Christmas # # We wish you a Merry Christmas... # Lacy, I'm scared. # We wish you a Merry Christmas # # We wish you a Merry Christmas # # Wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ## Good morning, you sleepy-heads. I made your favorite, cinnamon waffles. What have you got there? Oh, fun! Who is this person? You want cinnamon waffles? You gotta get through your ol' Gram Gram first. Tshh! Gram Gram? Sit, sit, sit! You're gonna love this. Hurry up and eat before they get cold. - Oh, my gosh. - What? Are they poisoned? They're fluffy pillows from heaven. Eve, what are you doing? They could be arsenic waffles! - Don't care, worth it. - Eve! Lacy, we're not in danger. Look around! That tree, the lights, the snow, it's so cozy. And this Gram Gram, she's so happy! Do you ever remember seeing our grandma smile? Once, when she hit a kid on his bike. There has to be some other explanation. Oh, it's so nice to have you girls come on back to your hometown from the big city for the holidays. Maybe you can help me plan our annual Christmas bake-off while we decorate the tree and figure out who is sending Millie all those gifts from the 12 Days of Christmas. So many birds! This is everything I ever wanted. - This is impossible. - So are these waffles. Who wants seconds? This place is amazing! It's almost like... - No. - Yes! My wish! - We're in a Christmas movie. - We're in a Christmas movie! What? Mm, yay! Yay. Holiday Falls. Oh, it's like a Christmas dream. Or a Christmas nightmare. Quick, slap me so I can wake up. I mean, how do we know this is a Christmas movie? Have you ever seen a town like this? Smiling shoppers. Children throwing snowballs. Christmas carolers! #...wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy... # Okay, but that doesn't mean... Extra! Extra! # Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year # Fine. Now how do we get home? Home? What are you talking about? Lacy, look around! We're finally gonna have the Christmas we deserve! Eve, I don't like Christmas-movie Christmases on TV. - I don't want to live in one. - Come on! This is a dream come true! Your dream. Your wish. Why am I here? To accompany me on my Christmas journey! Ah... But can't I just do that in spirit? In every Christmas movie you have your best friend with you. Look! A Christmas tree and poinsettia farm! On Main Street? It sure was nice of them to give us free poinsettias. Sure, but it's not exactly a great business model. Hey, isn't that the same Santa from last night? There's only one Santa. Of course there is, cutest child in the world. - What's your name? - I'm London. Who are you? I'm Eve. And this is my sister, Lacy. Nice to meet you. We're here visiting from the city for Christmas. What are you gonna ask Santa for? I'm gonna ask him for some answers. Lacy! I'm gonna ask Santa to bring my daddy back. I miss him so much. I know for a fact that Christmas is the day that Santa grants wishes. All right, I'm heading to the front. What? Lacy, get back in line. Hey, Santa. Hey! - Lacy, stop it! - Hey! You'll have to wait your turn. What's going on? Is this a dream? I'm not with her. Santa brought you here because you made a wish. You'll go home when you see that wish through. When will that be? I've got a meeting on Monday. And my boss doesn't give excused absences for magical Christmas journeys! Lacy, stop arguing with Santa. He'll put you on the naughty list. Sorry, Santa. Love your work! No... Eve! Eve, what are you doing? We have to get home. We both have jobs! Lacy, when we left home, it was Christmas Eve, but here... we're on Christmas movie time. - Relax. - A week? I can't stay here another week. "See the wish through." How do we see the wish through? Well, I wished my life was a Christmas movie. Maybe I need to live out a Christmas movie? - How do you do that? - I don't know. Uh, I guess I need to find my storyline. But where? Oh, girls! Girls! Oh! I've been looking everywhere for you. - Did you hear? - Hear what? Our Christmas festival is in trouble. That was convenient. Gram Gram, what happened? - You know Jack? - Not really. - Shh, go on. - He's a Christmas party planner. And he was going to plan the festival. But he has to go spend Christmas with his Great-aunt Agnes... - Of course. Really? - In Frosty Fjord. And now we have no one to plan the Christmas festival. - Yes, you do. - Who? Yes, who? Lacy and I would love to save Christmas. Wouldn't we, Lacy? - Um... - Wonderful! Come on, Lacy. Tell me again why you got gifts? It's Christmas, we can't just not give our Gram Gram a present. Our Gram Gram is a fictional character. Lacy, focus, we have exactly one week to pull the whole festival together. We'll just put up a few lights, get someone to sing a song. I don't see what the big deal is. Eve, I thought we were focusing. Sorry. I just... I have my storyline, but what about my beau? Your beau? My handsome prince, my high-school sweetheart whose romantic potential I've long overlooked even as it stared me right in the face. Where's my beau? Let me help you with that. Actually, um, maybe you guys can help me. I'm looking for Eve Bell. Do you know her? Eve Bell? Eve Bell is me. I, I hear you're-you're gonna save Christmas. Um, my name is Dustin. Your grandmother told me what happened. Uh, I own the local inn. I'm here to help. How amazing was that? The cute small-town innkeeper who wants to save Christmas. Ah. This is the best. And I'm glad you're having a good time. But what am I supposed to do? - What do you mean? - Well, this is your wish. Your movie. What am I, the sidekick? Don't be such a scrinch. Why are all the good things happening to you here? Why doesn't something good happen to me here? - Chad Matthew Monroe. - Chad Matthew Monroe. There she is. Touche, magical Christmas land. Hello, Eve, darling. Touche, magical Christmas land. Hi... darling. And who are you this time? Russell Clark... the boyfriend. Maybe we just never go home. What are you up to, my love? Saving Christmas? Why don't I walk you home and you tell me all about it? Do you wanna come in? I'm off to the inn for the night. Thank you. Oh. Cheerio. Thanks for walking us home, Chad. Chad? Russell! Sorry, sweetie. Chad Matthew Monroe! Lucky you, you have two cute guys chasing after you. I know! This has never happened to me before. Not since those security guards mistook me for a shoplifter. But who will I choose? The handsome small-town innkeeper or the gorgeous, international pop star? I can't wait to stand around and find out. Girls, come inside before you catch a cold. I baked cookies! Do you think calories count here? - I think we should go with no. - Agreed. I thought you girls might enjoy some treats while we decorate the tree. And if we finish these, I always have more. What's in the box? Only my favorite things ever to exist ever. Our Christmas ornaments. Ooh, fun! Let's get you changed first. Changed? Eve, you made this one when you were just a little girl. It's my favorite. And, Lacy, this is from your dance recital. It's also my favorite. Is it just me or are these hideous? We were not talented children. You were always the best at decorating the tree. - Can you do the honors? - Oh... Yeah, Eve is not great at decorating. Nonsense. Go ahead, sweetie. Okay. Ooh. Ah! Eve... Is it that bad? It's... beautiful! I'm amazing. I was thinking, because we don't have the biggest budget, maybe we could get some of the local businesses to donate decorations. I love that idea. I was thinking the exact same thing. All right, so after this, you know, we can go around, see if we can recruit some more help. Perfect, oh, and then I thought we could put something fun over there. - Like a... - Hot-chocolate stand. I was seriously gonna say hot-chocolate stand. Great minds think alike. They sure do. And every great party needs a good theme. So I was thinking something along the lines of... - Winter Wonderland? - Winter Wonderland. Wait. Did you steal my binder? No, I did not. Did you steal mine? - Wait, twelve? - Yeah. Well, yeah, you know, I'm efficient. You sure are. Eve Bell, there's just somethin' about you. Me? Yeah, you're just so talented and sweet and, obviously, organized. - You think so? - I do. I really do. I'm really glad we're doin' this together. Me, too. So did you guys need my help? Or... Oh, Lacy, right. Um, why don't you... Okay, you clearly don't need me here and this is getting a little weird. So I just, I think I'm gonna go explore a bit and let you guys do your thing. Ah... Hey, sorry. I think I got a little caught up. I get it, I just don't really wanna spend my day third-wheeling. Get out of my way! Sorry, dude. - Was that... - Mr. Peterson. Did he follow you here to ruin your movie? Look, just you watch, he might seem grumpy now, but he'll have the most heartwarming Christmas of all. Neat. - Hi. - Hi. - It was me. - Yeah. - That was good, you got me. - Thank you. Nice, very nice. Well, if calories don't count here... Come to mama. Hi. Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Hi. So nice of you to drop in. No. Moment's over. You can stand me up now. Thanks for that. Don't mention it. So what brings you in today? Cookies, mostly. Me, too. Thank you. Okay, you can stop staring. I'm Paul. Lacy. What do I owe you for the cookie? Oh, it's on the house. Is the entire economy of this town based on giving things away? It's great, isn't it? Yeah. Great. So, Paul, you look like a... normal person. What is it that you do around here for fun? Oh, we know how to have a good time. Yesterday I got into a snowball fight with some kids. Well, great as that sounds, I think I'm probably just gonna figure out my own thing. - Mm-hmm. - But thank you for the cookie. It was nice to meet you, Paul. Bye, Lacy. So, how are you liking Christmas time in Holiday Falls? Well, it's everything I hoped it would be. The town is beautiful, people are kind, the men are so... chivalrous. You know, I had a, a great time with you today. - Me, too. - Uh... I don't know if you got any plans tonight, but I'm gonna go caroling by the big tree. I mean, maybe you'd like to join? Swoon. - What? - I'd love to. Great. Great. All right, I'll see you there at 8:00. - Perfect. See you then. - Okay. Bye. Don't judge me. I wouldn't dream of it. Why did you come here and suddenly you're the Christmas queen, while I'm still... Well, if you stay a scrinch, nothing magical will ever happen. You have to believe, dear sister. Oh! Ooh. Heh-heh. - Mrs. Bell. - Ooh. Such a pleasure to finally meet you. I'm Russell Clark. Ooh, I heard you saying your special friend was in town, so I invited him to dinner. Hello, Evey. Um, I-I might already have plans tonight. But I suppose they can wait. Perfect. Perfect. The magazines absolutely loved that I found myself a commoner. Hm. They compared me to the Prince of Norgravia. Sure is nice to have been chosen from the common people. It truly is, isn't it? You're welcome. It's like what Eve told me when we first met in the city, "Russell, you have a gift, and the world needs to hear it." - You said that? - Mm-mm. Wait! This is perfect! - Our love? - No. Well, maybe. Uh, no. This is perfect timing! You can play at the Christmas festival! Ee... A small-town Christmas festival. Eve, I'm a world-famous superstar. And this would be... splendid PR. - I'm in. - He's in! A little early Christmas present. Russell, you didn't have to. I know. Wow! It's the colors of Christmas. Oh. I can get used to this. See you tomorrow, darling. Goodnight. Wait, you're leaving again? What am I supposed to do? I'm so bored. I'm going caroling with Dustin. - You wanna come? - Not that bored. How are you bored in a magical Christmas wonderland? There's so much to see. Why don't you go for a walk? Right. I'm gonna go for a walk. You can help me make cookies! Right. I'm gonna go for a walk. # Cookies baking # # Laughter in the kitchen # # Children making... # Wow! # Angels in the snow # # Hanging the stockings # # Trees topped with an angel # # Santa's comin' # # All the children know # # Caring sharing # # Lovely Christmas time # Oh, it's you. I was just on my way home from volunteering at the local animal shelter. Of course you were. And I saw you sitting here, so I thought I'd drop you a card. A hand-drawn, personalized card? You just happened to have one on you? - Lucky, right? - Well... That's not even a little bit creepy. You know, we always need some more help at the shelter. Maybe you wanna drop by the bakery tomorrow? I'm baking some treats for the pups. - I don't really... - Come on! Unless you have something more important to do. Okay, fine, but only for the adorable puppies and kittens who undoubtedly need to find homes before Christmas. Then it's a date. Uh, date? It's not a date. Uh, Paul? It's not a date! # Caring sharing # # Lovely # # Christmas time... # - Oh. Hi. - Hey. Are we early? Uh, no. No, you're right on time. - Oh. Where is everybody? - What do you mean? You said you were going caroling. And I am. - By yourself? - No. With you. Um, I'm not exactly a great singer. Well, it's not about being a great singer. Okay? It's about having fun together. Okay? - We'll start slow. - All right. # Deck the halls with boughs of holly # # Fa-la la-la-la la-la la-la # # 'Tis the season to be jolly # # Fa-la la-la-la la-la la-la # Wow! I sound amazing here! Yes, you do. # Don we now our gay apparel # # Fa-la-la la-la-la la-la-la # # Troll the ancient Yuletide carol # # Fa-la la-la-la la-la la-la # Keep it down! Ah... Hey, you wanna go for a ride? Ride? Yeah. Trust me. - Okay. - Come on. It's so beautiful here. Have you always lived in Holiday Falls? Uh, no, no, actually, I moved here from the city a few years ago. Huh? I wouldn't have pictured you as the city type. Well, I had a dream of saving a historical building and renovating it into a hotel. That's so cool. What happened? I don't know. Everything in the city just kinda felt, mm... Impossible? Yeah. Ah... I know what you mean. I mean, I still think about it. I mean, isn't it worth it, you know, follow your dream? But you have the perfect life here in Holiday Falls. I love this town, but sometimes I wonder if this is the life I chose or just the one I escaped to. You have got to be kidding me. How did he... No, this is too much. No, creepy stalker dude. No. What's going on? - Who's that from? - This guy I met. He makes these handmade cards. Oh, that's adorable. Not adorable. The free cookie was nice, but this is too much. I have to put a stop to this right now. Speaking of putting a stop to things, I'm having dinner with Russell tonight, and I think I need to break up with him. I feel guilty hanging out with two guys at once. You're not exclusive with Dustin. You haven't even kissed Dustin. And supposedly you're dating Russell, but you weren't present for that conversation. So, I don't think you're doing anything wrong. I've done way worse things. For example, I'm about to go break this man's heart. And it's going to be quick and it's going to be painless for me. Lacy... Maybe you should give this guy a chance. I don't think so. I just think it might be good for you to spend time with someone different. He's not different. He's unbalanced. See you later! # Don we now our gay apparel # # Fa-la-la la-la-la la-la-la # # Troll the ancient Yuletide carol # # Fa-la la-la-la # # La-la la-la # Dusty. I thought I'd find you here. Noelle? Uh, what are you doing here? I'm here to save your festival, of course. Noelle Saint Vanderkloot of the Solen Vanderkloots. Eve Bell. Like a bell. Ding! So nice to meet you, Eve. I'm sure Dusty's told you all about me. Um... Or maybe he hasn't. Yeah, well, Noelle and I, w-we used to date, back in the city. But that was a long time ago. Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you. So are you, are you in town for the holidays or... Funny story, I was actually going to stay in the city this year, but when I heard that the Holiday Falls Christmas Festival was in danger... I couldn't sit still. I love this town. But you've never been here before. Yes, but the way you described it, Dusty, I had to come help. I felt it was my duty. Uh, well, you know, Eve and I, we've been handling, uh, most of the planning and we're already getting things back on track. Mm-hmm. If all goes to plan, we should be able to pull it off. - Oh, we will. - Totally. I can't wait to see what you've come up with. But I have attended many VIP events in the city and I know what it takes to make one successful. I even attended the royal wedding in Norgravia. - Wow! - Eve. Don't you think you could use all the help you can get? The festival is just a few days away. I don't see why you can't help out. Really? That's fantastic. Holiday Falls will thank you for it. Oh. Oh. I'm gonna go grab us some peppermint mochas. When I get back, we'll get started on saving the festival. Actually, we've already gotten started. You didn't tell me about Noelle. Well, I-I had no idea she'd be here. I haven't talked to her since I left the city. Uh-huh. Perfect timing. She seems sweet. Yeah, well, you don't know Noelle like I do. Oh, I know that she suddenly appeared because she is supposed to be the obstacle between me and you. What? I think it'll be fine. She has a lot of experience, so... Well done! Nice work, London! How did you get so good at this? My dad and me used to bake with my grandma before he had to go away. Well, I'm happy you're here to help. You made it! Here, grab some frosting. Actually, I need to talk to you about your cards. I hand-painted them myself. They're very nice, Paul. They're just... They're stalker-y and weird and it's too much. And when were you at my window? Okay, I can take a hint. No more cards. I mean, it's not a hint. I am explicitly telling you to stop. Lacy, you are looking beautiful this morning. Here's a little something from Paul. Uh, actually, London, that's very nice. - But Lacy doesn't like cards. - She doesn't like cards? But you make the best cards in the world, Paul. Well, not everyone likes everything, and that's okay. I don't like candy canes. Some people think I'm crazy. You know what? I would love that card from Paul. Sometimes I can be grumpy and I forget to be grateful. I understand. Thank you, token adorable child, and, um, thank you, Paul. Paul said you came to help us decorate cookies. Ee! - I would love to help you. - Yay! - You can sit right next to me! - Yes. Okay. Don't you ever draw me sleeping through my window again. It's creepy, Paul. Noted. Put the icing right on the cookie and make fudges, right? Let me help you with that. Hey, guys. Hey. So I was just going over the plan with Dusty, and I have to say you guys have done some really great work here. Thank you. But I have some ideas that might help take it up a notch. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that no one remembers what they did at the party. What they remember is how you made them feel. What feeling do we want to leave these people with? What is the essence of this event? Joy. Cheer. Prestige. Bye, guys! - Thanks for your help! - Bye, London. What's wrong? Was it the cookies? I knew I used too much ginger. No, no, it's not that, it was... It was actually the most fun I've had in a while, I just... This place is so different from where I'm from. You miss the city? Holiday Falls is great. I just... I'm not very good at staying in places for long. Maybe I could help you. Not unless you can bring me to Santa. Sure. Wait, really? Yeah. Let's go. That was easy. Nice. Okay, pick a bow, any bow. Ooh! Hey, you're pretty good at this. Yeah, you're not so bad yourself. They're so pretty. I almost wish they could stay wrapped forever. Well, it's not the point of a present, right? I mean, the wrapping's just temporary. Meant to be enjoyed while it's here. Yeah. But that's kind of the beauty, right? You know, the mystery of what it could be and the sense of anticipation. - Dang it! - What? What's wrong? No, nothing. This is perfect. There's just... something I have to do. But thank you for a fun night. Yeah. Yeah, anytime. Goodnight, Dustin. Goodnight. Here we are! Uh, Paul, Santa's not here. Oh. He's usually... Ho-ho-ho! There he is! - Hi, Santa. - Paul! And hello to you, Lacy. It's good to see the two of you getting along so well. Now, what can Santa do for you? Lacy here has a question. Actually, I have a lot of questions. But for starters, I know you brought us here for Eve's wish. But when can we get back home? Is it that you want to go home, Lacy, or is it that you want to leave? This is what Eve wanted. I'm not sure why I'm here, too. Well, don't forget, you made a wish as well. I know. So do you think you've gotten what you wished for? No. Not yet. Wonderful things can happen if you give a place... or a person a chance. Why do people in these movies always speak in metaphors? What does that mean? Can't you just answer my question? It's better if you answer it yourself. Ooh! You're not helping. Sorry. What? Wher... Where did he go? Obviously, the North Pole, Lacy. - I, but I... - Come on, it's getting late. Let's get you home. Come on. So you can just talk to Santa whenever you want to? Of course. He's Santa. Can't you? I can't break up with Chad. He's my dream guy. Okay. - Evey! - Hi! You look beautiful. Thank you. So do you. N-no, I didn't mean that. I mean... Sorry. I'm a little nervous. Um... I need to talk to you. Of course, dear. What is it? I wanted to give this back to you. Don't be silly. This is a gift. Here. Huh... Now, I picked this out especially for you. You're the only person in the world I can truly be myself with. You are so very special, Evey. Actually, um, I wanted to talk to you... And I wanted to talk to you. To apologize. I feel as if I may have come off a bit arrogant with your family at dinner. And I hope I didn't embarrass you. Sometimes I just, I put a wall up when I meet new people. I a-actually relate to that. I don't usually do so well in high-pressure situations. I'm sorry to hear that. It must be difficult. You know, Russell, you should really let people see this side of you more often. You're actually pretty sweet when you let your guard down. Hm, I'm just so grateful to have someone like you who understands me. Of course. Thank you, Evey, for seeing through my insecurities, for accepting me, accepting all of me. You seem a bit quiet. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just... Have you ever had to do something you thought would be easy, but when the moment finally arrived, you choked? Honestly... no. I haven't. But is there anything I can do to help you? Um... You chickened out? I just couldn't break his heart, Lacy. Not on Christmas Eve-Eve. If not now, when? You're running out of time. After the show. Once I save Christmas, I will tell Russell the truth. And then we can go home. Right. About that... What? You've been dying to go home since we got here. And now that you've broken up with that Paul guy... - Yeah. So I didn't do that. - What? I decided to maybe kinda like him instead. Lacy, what? Yay! It's-it's not a big deal. Don't make it a big deal! - Okay. - I'm just... - Trying something different. - Mm-hmm. What? This means we can double-date. You can't double-date with five people. What are you gonna tell Dustin? I haven't figured that out yet. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we got a big assignment ahead of us today. The whole town is counting on us. I need everyone... to be on top of their games. I'm talking sweet. I'm talking chewy! I'm talking... Am I interrupting something? Lacy! Ahem! No. They are donations to help save the local dance studio. So I, um... I made you this. I drew one where I was chewing on your leg, but somehow that seemed to lack the Christmas spirit. It's very you. I adore it. Thank you. Happy Christmas Eve, by the way. Happy Christmas Eve, Lacy. So I was wondering if you wanted to come with me. I'm headed to the town square to do some last-minute festival prep with my sister and Dustin. I would love that. You heard from any of the vendors? No, not today. They should be here setting up by now. And where are the decorations? Well, I'm sure they'll be here soon. I just want everything to be perfect. Oh, I know exactly what you mean. - Need some extra hands? - Oh, hey! Are you volunteering? 'Tis the season. But don't get used to it. I'm surprised no one's come to me about the Christmas festival. I usually provide the Christmas cookies every year. Wait, N-Noelle hasn't talked to you? Yeah, we definitely talked about ordering cookies. - I haven't heard from her. - I asked her yesterday. She said it was taken care of. Okay, I'm sure there is an explanation. See, we put up a sign... Oh, look, here. Here she is now. Hello, everyone! Hey, uh, where have you been? And, you know, where are all the vendors and-and decorations and-and the cookies? You're so adorable when you get stressed. I told you, don't worry about it. I've got it handled. First, I'd like to introduce our headliner for tomorrow, Russell Clark. Afternoon. Hello, Evey. Russell. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Clark. I have all your songs, even the one you released in Japan and tried to erase off the Internet. It's not my favorite. Mine either. Thanks. Eve, of course, you need no introduction to your boyfriend. Boyfriend? Yes, boyfriend. So you've been seeing someone this entire time, Eve? Yes. And no. You didn't know? Oh, dear! I hope I haven't caused too much trouble. Well, now that all this ugliness is behind us, we can get back on track and focus on the Christmas festival. So what were you gonna do? You were just gonna lead me on? No! No, I was gonna break up with Russell. You were gonna break up with me? - Russell... - Don't you know who me is? Russell, I'm sorry. You're great. I didn't want it to happen this way. But you did want it to happen. I'm sorry. Well, I'm sick of this small town, anyway. - I'm going back to the city. - Wait, Russell, please. You can't go back to the city. The festival is tomorrow. You can all forget about Russell Clark playing your little Christmas festival. Goodbye, Evey. - Dustin... - It's fine. I don't think there's anything left to say. We'll just finish planning this and then we can go our separate ways. - Eve... - I'm okay. I have a festival to plan. Let us help you. I'll just see you at Gram Gram's, okay? I can't wait for you to see the new direction I've taken the festival this year. New direction? We didn't talk about a new direction. I had a moment of inspiration. Where's the tree? Noelle, this is not what we planned. I elevated the plan. I made it an experience. The new theme is City Lights. But it's not Christmas... without a Christmas tree. It's a minimalist motif. No tree needed. But where are all the decorations and the lights? And the presents for the kids? They were right there. So, I had to make a few cuts. I know it doesn't look like much now, but just wait for the hot chocolate I've imported from Chantelle's. You cut the gifts for the kids for hot chocolate? Kids like chocolate. Don't they? I wanted to give Holiday Falls an experience it wouldn't forget. But this has nothing to do with Christmas. People are expecting a Christmas festival. They're gonna be so disappointed. Okay, how much of the budget do we have left? Maybe we can salvage this. Salvage? I thought you would love all this. How much, Noelle? Well... nothing, okay? Chantelle's hot chocolate does not come cheap. So we have no decorations, no gifts, no Christmas tree and no budget left? But, yay, hot chocolate, though, right? We cannot bring the entire town out on Christmas for overpriced hot chocolate. What are you saying? We gotta cancel the festival. Wait, no, we can find a way to fix this. It's too late, Eve. The-the... Christmas is tomorrow. And this... this is not Christmas. Dustin... Goodbye, Eve. Poor Eve. Do you think there's anything we can do to help? I don't see how. You'll think of something. You're Lacy Bell. Being Lacy Bell hasn't seemed to help much so far. What are you talking about? You're kind, you're sweet, you're hard-working. You make people smile when you walk into a room. Paul, I'm not all those things. I'm not who you think I am. I think you're the most unique person I've ever met. Like a snowflake. But you don't melt easily. You're not like the other girls, and that's why I like you. You don't know the real me. I'm the girl who hasn't had a real relationship in ten years. I'm the girl who quits when it gets hard. I'm the girl who only dates jerks because they can't get close enough to hurt me. - But... - No. You make things beautiful, Paul. I destroy them. That's who I am. I don't deserve you. Yes, you do. Lacy, you deserve good things. I'm not sure I do. Eve, are you ready for Christmas tomorrow? I don't know if I'm gonna be celebrating Christmas this year, London. What? Why? I thought in Holiday Falls everything would be different. But I think my problems just followed me here. Maybe... I'm what's wrong with my life. But, Eve, tomorrow is Christmas. It's the day that wishes come true. You told me, remember? I don't know anymore. Don't say that, Eve! If your wish doesn't come true, what about mine? Was your day as bad as mine? Pushed away the best man I've ever met. You? Ruined the festival. Ruined Dustin, ruined Chad Matthew Monroe. Ruined Christmas for London. So much for everything always turning out all right in Holiday Falls. You wanna talk about it? No. You? No. Goodnight. Lacy, I want to go home. Me, too. Maybe if we find Santa, we can explain everything and he'll send us back. I don't think Santa's going to help us. It's Christmas. He's probably busy. I don't think Paul is gonna help me track him down again. I kind of burned that bridge. Of course you did. What does that mean? Nothing. No, what does that mean, of course I did? It's... I just mean that you're not exactly great at keeping things around. Jobs. Guys. Well, at least I go after jobs and guys. If I had your talent, I wouldn't let people pass over me the way that you do. I don't let people pass me over! You know what? It's Christmas morning. I don't want to fight. Where are you going? I don't know. I'll talk to you later. Merry Christmas, girls! No, it's not. It's the worst Christmas ever. Oh, dear. Eve, I-I try to be supportive of everything you do. I don't get to see you very often these days with you both being away in the city. And we just get a few days to be together at the most magical time of the year, and I want that time to be happy. So I'm telling you right now, knock it off. I will not tolerate this attitude in my house. Certainly not Christmas morning. Now, I don't know what's going on, but I'm here if you want to talk about it. I ruined the Christmas festival. I'm sorry to hear that. What are you gonna do about it? Oh, I know things are hard right now. But you're Eve Bell. You went off and made it in the city. You can do anything you set your mind to. You've just gotta give it a shot, see it through. You're right, Gram Gram. Thank you. Oh, cookie? Lacy? Lacy, you're right. I do let people pass me over. I didn't pitch my idea for the Spring Fling. I let Noelle take over the festival and she drove it into the ground. You're right, too. I'm tired of running. Tired of quitting everything and starting over. But what do we do? We're gonna take a risk and we're gonna save Christmas. But how? The festival is today. Don't worry. I have a plan. Paul! Ooh, sorry, buddy. Lacy! What are you doing here? I was so worried I was gonna mess things up with you, that I went ahead and messed things up on purpose. You deserve better than that. And I can be better than that. I know that now, because of you. You never saw me as a screw-up. You believed I was a good person and because of that, I believe it, too. And now I need your help. To do what? To save Christmas! What's the plan? - Montage! - Montage! Let's do this. Excuse me. Lady with the lights. Mm! Oh, my goodness! I can't believe we got that all done so quickly. There's only one thing missing, the entertainment. Now that Russell isn't playing, I don't know what we're gonna do. I know what'll work on that dude. Pardon me, little girl. Look, you're absolutely adorable, but you're in my way. I have a plane to catch. Russell, listen, you need to sing at the festival. I'm afraid that's out of the question. But you promised! The whole town is waiting for you. I'm sorry, little girl, but there's nothing anyone can do to convince me to go to the festival tonight. Russell, you don't wanna make a little girl cry. I think we might actually pull this off. I just hope people show up. Eve, look. Hello, Holiday Falls! Somebody told me recently I need to let my guard down more often. So I'm here to give it a try. Merry Christmas! I can't believe it. I can. # Hey-ho here comes the snow # # The trees are white the lights are glowing # # A winter day working away it's Christmas time... # You did an amazing job. I'm sorry I messed everything up. # Winter white is everywhere # # It's good to be alive... # This is the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted. Really makes the whole experience. You didn't mess everything up. You ladies did such a lovely job tonight. Thanks, Gram Gram. We couldn't have done it without you. That's true. Thank you for making this the best Christmas ever. Aw! # A happy day working away # # It's Christmas time # # Everyone's excited for # # Christmas to arrive # # Crispiness is in the air # # It's good to be alive # # Hey-ho here comes the snow hey-ho here comes the snow # # Hey-ho here comes the snow # # It's Christmas time # # It's Christmas time... # Can you do me a favor? Give this to Russell. Tell him I said thank you. # It's Christmas time... # I mean, if it would help you out. # It's Christmas time # That was nice. Well, if I know my Christmas movies, there's a perfect match for everyone. # Hey-ho here comes the cheer the gifts... # Look, it's Mr. Peterson. Oh, my goodness. It's finally happening. Everyone got their Christmas wish. Wait. There's still one more. Daddy! Hey! Ah, I missed you so much. Merry Christmas, London. - Honey! - Hey... Eve? You made it. I, uh, I got your note. This is incredible. Maybe the best Christmas festival I've ever seen. Thanks. I'm sorry that I bailed. I'm sorry that I lied to you. - It's okay. - It's okay. So you're... stuck on going back to the city? I realized something today, Dustin. I thought my perfect life was something I had to leave home to find. I was wrong. Life is whatever I make it. I wished for a perfect Christmas, but my perfect Christmas needs to be back home. It's too bad, though. There aren't many men like you in the city. And there aren't many women like you in Holiday Falls. That was it. That's it. My Christmas journey. You know, I made a wish, too. I wished to be a better person and you helped me see that I could. Thank you. Lacy. Is it... Christmas morning! I think I just had the weirdest dream. Me, too! I dreamt that Santa sent us into a Christmas movie. And there was this beautiful little town. - And this innkeeper. - And this baker. - And Chad Matthew Monroe. - And Chad Matthew Monroe. Do you smell that? Cinnamon waffles. Hey! You told me not to watch you sleep ever again, so I thought I'd serve breakfast. Paul! How are you here? Well, when you disappeared, I told Santa that I had a Christmas wish. What's that? Merry Christmas. It's perfect. Who wants cinnamon waffles? Gram Gram's recipe. There's something I have to do first. Elle, what are you doing here? It's Christmas. And I'm sorry to bother you, but there are some things I need to say, and they can't wait. First of all, I am a designer. A good one. And you're wasting my talent. Elle, this is absolutely the wrong time to be doing this. Second of all, my name is not Elle. It's Eve. And third of all, I just need to say that I deserve the layout for Spring Fling. I know that under that gruff exterior is a man who just wants to see something beautiful. You don't have to make any decisions now. I just needed to take a risk and take my shot. Well... come by my office on Monday. And, um, bring some ideas for the summer issue, too. Merry Christmas, Mr. Peterson. Merry Christmas... Eve. So how'd it go? Great. - It's just... - What's wrong? I miss Dustin. I'm happy to be home. - And I got the Spring Fling! - Yay! I just wish Dustin were here to see it. I wonder what he is doing right now. Merry Christmas, Eve. Dustin? I, um... I thought I'd give city living one more try. - Hey, guys. Great! - Hey! You know, I was thinking, the city sure is great, but maybe we could spend next Christmas back home. - Return to Holiday Falls? - Mm-hmm. I don't know. What do you think, Eve? Well, you know me. I love a sequel. # Snowflakes falling # # Gently past the window # # They'll be calling # # Just to say they came # # Candles glowing # # Warmly on the table # # Carols floating # # Toughly through the air # # Caring sharing # # Lovely # # Christmas time # # Caring sharing # # Lovely # # Christmas time #
