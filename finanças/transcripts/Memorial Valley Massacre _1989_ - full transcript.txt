Quiet, please. Quiet, please. We'll open up just as soon as we can. You'll have to wait. Take it easy, settle down. Sorry for the delay. Hey, man, where do you think you're going? - It's all right, I'm supposed to be working here. I'm David Sangster. Deke Brown. Sangster, huh? Heard you were coming. Same family, huh? It's my dad. - I'm surprised you didn't come up here together. You mean my father's here? - What do you mean the park's not ready to open? - Just what I said to you, Mr. Sangster. - You have been up here four months to make this campground operational. I show up for the big opening, Memorial Day weekend, And now you tell me the camp is not ready for the public? Well, I call that incompetence. We just lost a man In a construction accident this morning. - I don't want any alibis, no excuses. My firm has made a major investment in this development. We have big future plans for Memorial Valley. Ski resort, shopping centers, condominiums, Etcetera, and that's only the beginning. - Yes, sir, I hear you, but the roads aren't finished. The electrical's out, the supplies are late. - Did you hear about the water supply? What's the deal here? Your water's been tainted. What are you talking about? Aw, shit. That's the dog you had guarding the construction site. I think I'm gonna barf. - How long you reckon it's been down there? - Oh, he's been missing about a week. Started smelling something a couple days ago. - I ain't never seen nothing like this before. - Animals fall down wells all the time. - Ever known one to lift a 50-pound lid to do it? Screw the dog. Is the water fit to drink? You wanna try it? Just do me a favor, will you, Brady, And haul this carcass out of here, bury it deep in the woods. - Look, you get Deke to bury it for you. Me and my men are outta here. - You can't quit with the job half done. - After what happened this morning to Burt and now this, we don't want any part of your campground. Now, we're gonna take all the equipment we can haul And we'll come back for the big stuff later. Oh, this is just great. Now what are you gonna do? - Well, sir, looks like I'm gonna go down to the front gate and help Deke with that crowd of people, "cause half done or not, I gotta get this place open." Are you crazy? You ain't got no running water and those toilets we built are flushers. - Well, I'll just have to talk all these city folk Into roughing it a bit. Now you're talking, George. Memorial Valley Campground opens as scheduled. How's it going, Deke? - As well as can be expected for a two hour wait. - David, what are you doing here? Who's he? He's my son! - Well, you said that if I ever wanted a job On one of your projects, I could have it. I picked this one. Your secretary set it up for me, Dad. - Well, I had in mind a more important executive position when I made that offer. - This suits me just fine, thanks. Well, your pleasure. On the other hand, it may not be a bad idea having somebody here to watch my interest under these circumstances. Don't screw me up on this, Webster. I got a lot riding on this development. - Hell, George, you'd think this campground Was his idea in the first place. You were the one that sold him on Memorial Valley. - You sure picked a good spot for a campground. This is beautiful. I'm looking forward to working with you this summer. - You're working for me, kid, not with me. I'll try and do both. College boy, huh? - Yeah, Naturalist major, Dartmouth. - Well, Dartmouth, why don't you just stand Quietly over there while I take care of business? All righty. - Can I have your attention, folks? I'm sorry for the delay but, as you know, This is a brand new facility So we haven't got all the bugs out yet. As of this morning, we are without running water. Unfortunately, that means that we will Temporarily be without restroom facilities. - What do you mean "temporarily?" - Over this Memorial Day weekend at the least. We're going to distribute biodegradable toilet paper. So if you just give a little thought as to where, there really shouldn't be any problem. Maybe it will be helpful to think of yourself as pioneers. Well, good, now that all the softies have left, There are a couple of rules I would like to mention. No loose pets, no loud noises after nine, motorcycles and ATVs are prohibited by law. Oh, hell, I don't wanna hold you folks up anymore. Welcome to Memorial Valley. Deke, open the gate. - Nice speech, but how you gonna make it work? - Pick up your bags and come on. I'll show you where your bunk is. Think you packed enough? - I hope you don't mind sharing your cabin there, boss. I live alone and like it. You'll be staying at the camp store with Deke here. I'm sure it'll be fine. It's gonna have to be. Look, kid, let's get something straight right now. I didn't ask for you to come up here. In fact, I don't even want you here, "cause you're just gonna be in the way, But your daddy gave us both a job So I'm in no position to tell you not to stick around, huh? Is that clear? Crystal. Good, come on. Considering all the trouble You've been having up here lately, I guess I oughta be more careful. - Why, everything that's happened up here Has been purely accidental. I checked it all out. Deke doesn't think so. - Yeah, well, Deke has a very active imagination, And that's all. The matter's closed, go get that. George, something wrong? - Nothing, broken window, that's all. We'll fix it up later. All right. Hey, Byron, hey, killer. Gonna get some squirrels? Let's see those teeth, come on! Good boy, good boy. Byron, Byron! Can I help? Jesus! Is that your idea of funny? That your idea of accuracy? Looks like you might need some professional assistance. Take a hike, Dudley Do-Right. I can handle this myself. - Maybe I can save you 30 minutes. I've got the time. Maybe 40. What's your name? Sangster? Call me David. - Listen, Sangster, I'm sure you're probably A really nice guy, but, well, I did come here To be by myself, get it? Got it. Look, if you need anything. Anything. I live at the store. Sure. - Thanks for the nail trim, by the way. Maybe next time you can do the other foot. - And I thought they all lived in the city. Dorks in the wilderness. - Are you just out enjoying the wonders of nature? - Do you see that gorgeous woman in site 22? She's unreal. What woman? I got cigars older than her. What's this? - We've got to dig a couple of latrines. It ain't healthy to let folks shit just anywhere. Or didn't they teach you that at Dart-mouth? You're too much, man. - And I'm not running a goddamned dating service, boy. Hey, look at that. Hey, chick. Leon, toss me a brew. You shook the can, moron. - I'll tell you about another can that's shook up. 400 miles of shook up. And loving every minute of it. Gimme a kiss, baby. - So where do you suppose the rest Of us Roving Eyes are, huh? - Looks like we're the first ones here. Dream on. Ain't none of them lard butts gonna be making this trip. We're it. Bullshit. Merle's right. The days when we had 200 bikers rolling down I-70 on a road trip are gone. - Yeah, man, most of those mothers Have traded their Harleys and leathers in For Beamers and pinstriped suits. Face it, we're an anachronism. The hell I am. What's that mean, an "anachronism?" - It means we're not cool anymore. - It's my fault, I lead this pack. Or I'm supposed to anyway. But none of them other guys Ever really respected me as head of the group. Don't think that, man. Screw those other jokers. We made it, right? And that's all that really counts. - We're gonna party down just like every other Memorial Day run. - Yeah, get down, get down, all right. - Well, this should be interesting with no running water. - I tell you, the lack of dihydrogen oxide is not gonna affect this being in the least. - All hail, Mr. Einstein. - Yeah, smartass, what are you gonna shower and shave in? Beer. - That's good enough for now, come on. Good, good. - I bet those are the first blisters you ever got. - Well, that's a bet you'd lose, partner, But it's been a while. How you feeling? Tight, sore, but not that bad. Good. Well, about time we get back to base camp. It's just about time for you to start setting up. That's a nice watch. - Yeah, my daddy gave it to me a long time ago. Kinda like me, it just takes a beating and keeps right on going. Help! Help! Shakes, for Christ's sake, dozens of them All over our food! What? Goddamn, those are poisonous. Back up, back up. Hit them now. - Damn, what kind of place is this? I mean, first, the road's not finished, Then there's no water, then this? We could've been killed. We're leaving. - Sir, if you'll just give us a chance, I'm sure we... It's too damn late for that! What if my kids were here? We're just all damn lucky nobody was hurt, And we're leaving before somebody is. You know, I've heard stories about this valley, but I never paid any attention until now. That's gratitude for you. I don't blame him for leaving. Those snakes didn't get into that cooler by themselves. There's gotta be some sort of practical joker In the campground with a real warped sense of humor. - Yeah, probably one of those kids. And, look, let's keep this quiet. I don't want any unnecessary panic. - All right, I'll keep my mouth shut and my eyes open. - That was good, Dartmouth, what you did with those snakes. - Just something I picked up in college. Advanced Intermediate Snake Handling. - Yeah, you're your father's son all right. Always a smart comeback. - Hey, boss, you'd be doing me a favor if you leave my father out of this. - Yeah, and I'd feel better if I didn't have A corporate spy snooping around behind my back. Whoa, man, hold up. Look, you got me all wrong. I care about this valley. I'm here to work, that's it. - Fine, do your job, pass out these handbills. Just stay away from me and let me do my job, Everything will be okay. It's nothing personal. Right. Nothing personal. Check it out. The Three Musketeers immortalized in wood. - Yeah, man, you know, maybe we ought to cut This branch off this tree and take it home with us, Just to remember this partying weekend. - Why don't you take the whole tree while you're at it? - Good idea, where's my chainsaw at? - You guys are too much. Oh, really? Well, which one of us do you like better? Me or Rick? I don't know. You're both sort of cute in a weird kind of way. - Yeah, but which one of us do it, you know what I mean? You mean which one of you Would I like to sleep with? - Right, that's exactly what we mean. - Well maybe you'll just have to wait Until tonight to find out. Oh, come on, Wendy! Knock, knock, knock. - I hope we're not disturbing you. What do you want? - I'm Rita Bedokian and this is my husband Chuck. Say hello, Chuck. - Well, I'm Moe, and they're Larry and Curly. - I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names. Would you mind turning that music down a bit so I can hear you? Chuck you, Farley. - Yeah, what's the matter, don't you like speed metal? Forget it. Listen, we were wondering if you've seen our son. He's a big boy, little younger than you, I guess. Blonde hair. He took off the minute we got here And we just haven't seen him since. Does he look sort of like you? Oh, yes. Sort of dumpy and stupid? Now just a minute. Kind of fat and weird? I never. - He's probably out in the woods humping Bambi. - Or maybe he's playing up a knothole in some tree. - Come on, Chuck, we don't have to stay here And be insulted! - You can go somewhere else and be insulted. - How do they let people like that have children? Accidents do happen. Byron, Byron! Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you aware that there's no off-road Traveling allowed in this area? Oh, bug off, asshole. Hey, did you hear me? I don't see no stinking badge. I don't see no stinking keys. Hey, what the hell? Walter. What's going on here? - Smokey the Bear's taken my key. Ma'am, I'm David Sangster. I work for George Webster, head ranger. Your son was gonna take his bike for a ride. So, it's his bike, Sonny Jim. - I realize that, but it's against the law. Ah, there you are, David. You the head ranger? - I'm the only ranger here, ma'am, so, yes, I guess I'm the head one. - You tell your boy here to give my son Back the keys to his bike. Yeah, I wasn't gonna ride it. I was only gonna check out the engine. - You know it's against the law to ride bikes here, ma'am. Yes. It's a stupid law. We have a lot of money invested in these machines. - Ma'am, you've gotta understand that the natural balance in this valley is very delicate. Any invasion of the ecosystem by unrestricted vehicles like this one could destroy that balance. That sounds right. I want those keys back now. David. - You can get the keys back, ma'am, when you check out. In the meantime, if you ride either one of these bikes, You can expect a substantial fine. Come on, David, we've got work to do. You folks enjoy your stay here. Put the bike away. Oh, make me. - Where have you been all day and where'd you get the knife? I found it. - Stole it. - Stop it! You know he doesn't do that anymore. Do you, baby? Hi there. What can I do for you, sir? - General, George Webster, park ranger. Sorry to disturb you. Oh, I recognize you. You're that speechmaker that wants us all to be pioneers. Yeah, you got a minute? Step inside. Hello. - Ranger Webster, this is my wife Pepper. Well, my real name is Gloria, But all my friends call me Pepper. Pepper Mintz, get it? - Yes, ma'am, and sorry to barge in. Why don't you have a seat? How about a drink? - Oh, why not, have you got any Jack Daniels? Does a bear shit in the woods? Hey, scootch, you little pain in the rear. What's on your mind? Oh, I was just passing by, I noticed your trashcan had been scattered All over the side of your campsite. Is that right? Did you see or here anything? Maybe it was an animal. We like to tag the troublemakers and keep count. Thank you. That's a damn good idea. But I didn't hear a damn thing. - This place is soundproof. - Oh, by the way, I don't know If you folks are interested, but there's a party down by the picnic area tonight. Yeah, we saw the posters. - Well, you see, I'm not much of a party goer. I have everything I need right here. I got a CB out in front, I have a TV, stereo, books. Liquor. - You might say that I'm in touch and out of touch at the same time. As a matter of fact, Pepper and I were just getting ready to watch the Army-Navy game form 1958 on my VCR. Goddamn, one hell of a game. Wanna stick around. Got any more of this? All you want. I believe I'll stay a while. Well, that's just fine. You sit back and relax and don't worry about a thing 'Cause nothing short of World War I Is gonna bother you here. Give us a minute, will you, Pepper? Scoot, baby. And I know the outcome of this game. I wanna know who you want, Army or Navy? - Uh... - You lose. Cheers. Brew coming through. Thank you. Have some provisions here. Here you go. Have one on me. This is a nice little bash. Yeah, if you like people. - Come on, George, it's your party. - I think I'm gonna take a stroll. You keep an eye on things here. - Okay, Chief, but what do I do if they try to escape? Let them. Oh no. Okay, everybody, good time to move under cover. Come on, let's go. Come on, you don't wanna get wet. Just keep coming to the back of the tent. There's plenty of room. That thumping just kept up. Thump, thump, thump on top of the roof of the car. If that girl had been any more terrified than she was, her hair would surely have turned white. Thump, thump, thump. Hours later, the police showed up, told the young woman, just gently climb into the back of the squad car and everything will be fine. But she had to look, didn't she? There above the car, hanging by his heels, Was her boyfriend, his throat cut, gutted, his arms rocking back and forth in the wind. Thump, thump, thump. - What kind of shit is that, old man? - You don't jump at things that bump in the dark, huh? It's a bad habit to follow up here. Yeah, good, I like bad habits. - It must be a shame to your mother for you to have grown up to be so silly. Plenty of things have happened up here in the valley That nobody can explain. It's been happening eons before you got here, son. It's gonna keep going on eons after you're dead. Ooh. Shit. That asshole is boring. - Deke, I understand that this whole area's virgin forest. My guidebook said that there are some varieties Of trees and plants that can only be found Growing in this valley. - Yes, Memorial Valley is unusual, that's for sure. One of a kind. - It's what's known as a micro-ecosystem. This entire valley has been isolated and protected For so long, it's a pity to see it Finally being turned into parkland. I kind of like to think of it as nature's inner sanctum. - Yeah, well, you gotta have some place to party. David's right. Until now, Memorial Valley has been God's private woodland, like it just fell form the skies With only the stars to feast their eye on it. - Well all I know is it gives me the creeps. What's he doing out there? Tracking. In the rain? - Old George can track just about anything, Day, night, rain, or shine. Met him in 'Nom in '67. He was Special Forces solo enemy reconnaissance. Best there ever was. Once he finds a pattern, well, he's good. Somebody would have to be awful good To be better than him. - What's he after out there in the rain? His past. I should not be telling you this, But since you're gonna be here all summer, I just don't want you to get on the bad side of him. He really doesn't like to talk about it. Back in the '60s, George got married. He had a kid. His wife split on him when she met up with some rich guy. Well, as it turned out, the kid was kidnapped by some drifter name of Prescott. Ransom was supposed to be dropped off Here in Memorial Valley. Told him where to pick up the boy. No tricks. Well, the police and the FBI set a trap, But they blew it. They lost the boy and Prescott deep in the woods. By the time they brought in ole George To try and track him down, it was too late. What happened? - Well, he found the deserted camp right away. It appeared that they had headed west Out into the wilderness on foot. He followed them for days. The trail vanished. No trace. Everyone realized then that a shallow grave Was probably where the boy wound up. But George has been looking ever since. Looking for a [t comforts him. So does his drink. Woo, it's cold! But nice. Woo! I'll say it's nice. - Come on, baby, take it off, we're all friends here. Yeah, come on, take it off. Wouldn't you like that? Pipe down, Eddie. - What's the matter, you jealous? Come on, the show is over. - Yeah, it's time for our own private party. - Remember when we were that young? - We didn't act as stupid as she does. Still do, honey. - Come on, L.D., that young poontang made Daddy horny. Let's go, Flo. Being out here in the woods brings out the animal in me. - Oh, great, and nothing between me And the cold hard ground but a sleeping bag. - Can Dudley Do-Right offer you a dry walk home, fair lady? I was hoping you'd ask. I'm a woman in need of... A man? A poncho. Come on, Wendy, let us in! Yeah, we're drowning out here! Go sleep in the car! At least let one of us in! Forget it! - You little cocktease, you've come onto us all day long. Now it's time to put out, you back down. Yeah, all talk, no action. Come on, Wendy, let's do our thing. Do your own thing. - Ah, young love, isn't it romantic? Heartwarming. Well, I guess I'll just... Quick, get in. Well, take off your poncho. Okay. - I like what you said back at the party About this being the inner sanctum of nature. It's a very accurate description. Kind of poetic, too. Most guys don't usually say poetic things. Too afraid. - When I was a kid, I used to come into this valley with my dad every summer. It was a long time ago, but, even then, I knew it was a very special place. - To the inner sanctum, Memorial Valley. Hear, hear. God. That oughta warm us up. Are you as cold as I am? I am freezing. - You know, neither one of us is going to get warm, In these wet clothes. You take that end of the tent, and I'll take this one. Yes? - You, uh, you wouldn't kid me, would you? - I can trust you, we're both adults. - Yeah, well, it's the adult part that's the problem. - Problems were meant to be overcome. Turn around. Any warmer? - It does seem to be heating up in here. You know, I took a wilderness survival course last year and a big part of it Was about keeping warm without a fire. Oh yeah, what's the trick? - Well, the main idea is to conserve Whatever heat you've got, and to share That warmth with whomever you're surviving with. But we don't have any heat. - No, no, we do, our body temperatures. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, so if I were to put my body close to yours, And you put yours close to mine, 98.6 plus 98.6 equals... The boiling point. You know, I wouldn't be doing this If it weren't a question of our survival. - You could survive like this for a long time. - Come on, Wendy, we're drowning out here! Yeah, and it's my tent! - Okay, but you've gotta promise, no funny stuff. - We promise, we promise, just let us in. - Al right, you can come in Now. Thanks a lot. Oh, you're all wet. - That's 'cause it's raining outside, remember? Are you guys mad at me? - No, let's forget about the whole thing And get some sleep. - I don't want you guys to be mad at me. Maybe there's some way I could make it up to you. Oh, no, you don't. I'm not stupid enough to fall for that come-on Twice in the same night. I am! Chill out, both of you. Nobody's doing nothing tonight but sleeping. - Ooh, Tom, I like it when you take control like that. Cut it out, Wendy. - Hey, guys, there's something out there. What? - There's something right outside our campsite. - If you guys are trying to scare me, it's not working. It's probably just a raccoon. Now can we get some sleep? No, Tom, listen. It's just a dog. Go home, puppy. Holy shit! Get him in here, quick. Put him down. - Oh, God, what the hell got him? This is terrible. - Shape of those wounds, I'd say it was an animal attack. Yeah. What animal could do this? Bear. Tom saw one running away. Took a swipe at their tent, But I didn't think a bear could do this. Why? Well look at the cuts. They're too clean. - You see any other kind of tracks out there? No, nothing. Nothing, you looked? Of course I looked. Well, it had to be something. Now we got a death to add To the Memorial Day weekend statistics. I'll call the police. No. No. We gotta tell them. I do it, I know who to talk to. Okay, better call my dad. No! - There's been a death here, George, he's gotta know! - He'll be notified by proper authorities And that's soon enough. Step aside, George. This is my valley, my problem. And I'll handle it my way. - Oh, that's great, that's just great! Now how are we supposed to call the police? I've still got the shortwave. Oh, my baby. Oh, Walter. That's my baby. That's my baby! - Folks, it's 60 miles to the hospital in Wentanto. You follow me, very slow, all right? All right. Come on, dear, let's go. You look beat, Paul. Goddamn holidays. Short of help, of course, and this rain's really doing a number on the roads. Whole damn weather system just snuck in. I guess you're all set, huh? - You know, George, as long as that bear is still out there, you got a problem. - We probably can't get any help to you out here until first of the week, if then. Rain's got the valley isolated, and, if it keeps up like this, Coast Guard's the only one's gonna get in here. - I'm planning on a hunting party this morning. All right. I'll have the hospital radio the coroner's report to you. Thanks, Paul. Follow me. See, everything's straight up. Still mad, huh? You better believe it. Yeah, life's a bitch. You round up all the campers that are still left, Have them at the picnic area by 7-30. We've got some discussing to do. What's to discuss? We send everyone home before somebody else gets hurt. - You'd love to see this place fold, wouldn't you? Are you blind, man? This place has folded all by itself. - Everyone here? - Just about. - Folks, could you gather around, please? Now, I'm sure you've all heard by now about the boy who was attacked by a bear. Best I can make out, he was illegally motorcycling in the backwoods, so the attack did not occur on the campground. Nevertheless, I'm leading a hunting party this morning to get the bear, So I would like volunteers to show up at the camp store. We'll supply rifles for those who don't have them. Oh, there's a possibility that the roads may wash out. If that occurs, we'll have them back in service in a couple of days. And you don't intend to close. Not necessary. Memorial Valley remains open. - Anyway, that's what we heard on the radio. Thank you. So there's a possibility that if the roads do wash out, and they probably will, None of you will be able to get outta here until the middle of next week. We ain't got nothing but time. - Look, you close the grounds, we go. You don't, we stay. It's a hell of a ride home, And I'm not even rested up yet. Besides, it's gorgeous out now, huh? George won't close. - He oughta know, he's in charge, ain't he? Besides, you ever tried riding One of these hogs in mud? - These things ain't quite like that dirt bike that kid had. - Yeah, by the way, what happened to the kid's bike? I didn't see it on the back of the trailer When it pulled out. - We're gonna go look for it a little later. We're gonna try and find that bear, too. That bike can't be far. I mean, the kid had a broken neck and back. How far could he crawl? Depends on what's chasing you. Yeah. Thanks for the coffee. Y'all be careful, okay? And if you see anything, let us know. Will do, buddy. Good luck on your safari. Well, boys and girls, it might be worth our while To go on a little hunting trip ourselves, huh? - Care for a bear meat burger, Emily? - Bear meat, what's the matter with you? I'm talking about the bike. That's gotta be a few hundred bucks in spare parts there. Hey, you're right. - Wait, you guys are gonna go running out into the woods With a killer bear on the loose? You're nuts. What's there to worry about? Got this. Ain't nothing gonna bother me with this. I'm game, let's go. You guys are crazy. Wives, talk some sense into your senseless husbands. - They're gonna do what they want No matter what we tell them. - Just don't go and get yourselves hurt, all right? - Not a chance. - I ain't going. Well, shit, who needs you? Just like the rest of those wimps In the Roving Eyes who were too lame to even show up. No balls, no guts. Come on. Show me what you got. Stay here with the girls, help them clean up. Come on, bear meat. I don't think we should go. Are you kidding? They're passing out guns and ammo At the camp store like it was candy. This bear hunt's gonna be bitching. - What do you guys know about guns? The most shooting you've ever done Was with BB guns, trying to hit Car windows from a freeway overpass. - This has gotta be easier than that. - Besides, the bear drew first blood. He tore my tent. Go ahead, do your macho thing. I'm staying right here. All by yourself? Are you sure you want to? You may wind up like that Bedokian kid. - Yeah, man, he looked like raw hamburger, but if you don't wanna come. All right, I'll come, But I'm not gonna shoot any stupid guns. That's our girl. - So I'd appreciate it if you'd come along. Bear. Maneater? Looks like. - All right, I'm gonna give you two hours and no more. Game leg of mine, know what I mean? At the most, sir. I just wanna make sure he's not around any more. - What about that boy that works for you? He came in here screaming like a banshee And telling us that things weren't like they seemed And warned us to get the hell outta here. - He has no idea what he's talking about, sir. He's never been off campus before. Take this one. All right! - All right, you've all got your assignments. We're gonna sweep out to the south and then come back into the camp. And do not fire your weapon Unless you absolutely have to. Well said, George. I wanna talk to you later. Any time. Let's get moving. - Bike's gotta be here somewhere. How far can you crawl with a broken neck and back? - How do you know they haven't already found it? Well, we don't. Beer is warm. Let's get back, I'm tired. Sure, which way? - Which way, aren't you keeping track? Track, I don't know about you, But all these trees looks alike to me. We're lost. You get me out here and you tell me we're lost? - Oh now, take it easy, there's a path right here. Does it go back? - It's gotta lead somewhere, my man. Let's go, bear meat. Hot shot. - These two are really gonna be a big help. - Cut it out, you two, you'll scare him off. It doesn't matter. We haven't seen any trace of a bear. - Yeah, there ain't even any berries around. If the bear's not here, he's probably a lot farther back in. That's a relief. - You'd think we'd at least see the motorbike. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Hey! Hey, get me down! What happened? - Rick stepped on some sort of trap and wound up there. - I oughta leave you hung up there, you little asshole. - Hey, man, come on, get me down. It ain't my fault! - All right, cut him down. I warned you about these two And what the hell happened? - Don't ask me. - Catch him. You okay? Poachers. I've had reports of them in this area before. This a trap they set. Poachers? They must've been pretty resourceful. I mean, why didn't they just use rope Instead of going to all the trouble Of rigging this with vine? Who knows? But there are probably more of these traps in the area. We're going back. Come on, General. - Yeah. I ain't got a lot Of blood to drain anyway. - Ranger, you didn't happen to see My two stupid friends up there, did you? Why, are they out there now? - Yeah, they left a couple of hours ago And they're wives are getting a bit concerned. Your friends are fools. - Shouldn't we go looking for them? - I'll go. - Me, too. - Sounds great. - Good. Hold it up, beaver scouts, we'll just give them a little more time. If they're not back after we've rested, Then we'll go looking for them. - You know where I'll be, George. You felt it in there. You know now. What? We shouldn't be here. Hey, Eddie! You okay? Yeah, yeah. Look, man, it's a cave. Does somebody live here? One way to find out. Avon calling. I don't like this. God, it smells bad. Quiet. Look at this stuff. Somebody lives here. Who? Who knows? What if he comes back? - We'll get him to lead us back to camp. - What if he doesn't like our being here? Tough. Maybe he's got a map. Eddie, look! Oh, shit! I wonder who that is. Who that was you mean. Anything in it? This. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Check it out! Aw, if the guy's in the bowling league could see this. What are you doing? A souvenir. A souvenir? This trip's getting to you, isn't it? Hey, look, I'm going outside And look at this thing in the light. Yeah, go ahead. All right. - Hey, I'm gonna poke around here a little more. - Hey, what the hell are you shooting? Oh, Jesus! You're trespassing. You didn't hear that gunshot? You gonna get off your fat ass and do something? What gunshot? It came from over there. - Get Deke and three or four volunteers And leave that Merle here to cover our asses. That's done. I heard you used to be a pretty good tracker once. I'll get my gun. This time, we get him. Right. Give me some more bullets. - How can you guys go back out there After what just happened before? These woods are dangerous. Let's just leave. We can't leave now. This is just getting exciting. I'm scared, I wanna go home. - Wendy, we ain't gonna let anything happen to you. We're gonna Kill that goddamned bear. - I don't want you going out there, leaving me here alone, I'm frightened. - We'll only be gone an hour or so. Stay here, relax. Enjoy. - You promise you won't be gone long? Cross our hearts. Okay. But I'm still nervous being here alone. Then take my gun. I'll get another one from the ranger. This is the safety. When it's off, you can shoot anything that moves. Anything. Come on. - You guys better be back before dark. Let's go. Here, take this. Aw, come on, man. Is this what you want? Here, take it. Please, leave me alone! Hey, please, please. No, please, don't hurt me, please, don't hurt me! Did you hear that? It sounded like a scream. Don't get spooked. It's easy to let your imagination Run away with yourself out here, but it does look like we're on the right track. Couple of intelligent fellas, leave a trail a snowblind Texican could follow. Let's go, guys. Right behind you. A cave? What the hell? I'm going in. Oh my God! It's been a man all along. You knew. You knew. Good God, you knew all along It was no animal doing this. You could've stopped it. It might be my son. Your son? Who the hell cares? That kid, he killed that kid! You son of a bitch! Cut it out! We all gotta get outta here. - What about the others back at camp? We've gotta warn them. She's right. But I'm not gonna leave a man here like this. You fast? You mean like in running? I'm real fast. - Can you follow the trail back to the camp? I guess so. - Okay, you hightail it back to the camp store, Tell them what's happened here, Tell them to be on their guard. Get going. We're gonna rig a stretcher and haul the body back with us. - Fine, let's just do it and get out. Why are we stopping? Something's not right. Did you hear something? - I've been backtracking us exactly the way we came, And up til now Rick's been headed the right way. Here he takes a wrong turn, heads off into the woods. Maybe he took a shortcut. Not likely. Let's fan out, move carefully, see what we can find. Shit! Rick! Oh, no. Oh, God, this is terrible. - We gotta get outta here, George, fast. - What if whoever it is is between us and the camp? - Just calm down, just take it easy. - My best friend is lying there dead And you tell me to take it easy? I'm getting the fuck outta here. Don't panic, stick together! - I'm taking her back to base camp. What about them? We can't help them now. Hey, kid, what's happening? Hey, what's going on, tell us, man. Snap out of it, man, what's the matter? - Will somebody tell us what's going on? There's been some trouble. Eddie? Sorry, Mrs. Hertz. Where's Leon? They're dead. Something out there got them and the others, too. How the hell did this happen? - All right, look, we gotta tell the others. Tom, I want you to get Wendy and bring her here. - George's place would be the easiest to barricade. Merle, Tom. Tom, are you okay. Come on, man, you gotta help us out. Okay. - All right, go get Wendy and come back as quick as you can. Stop by the General's place, tell him to come, too. Tom, you come right back. Go. Now we're calling the police. Christ, the radio. He's way ahead of us. The CB in the Jeep. - What's all the ruckus out here, boy? - Everybody's supposed to be over at the ranger's cabin on the double. There's been some more murders. Some? Yeah, three more people. Please, you gotta hurry. I have to get Wendy. - What the hell am I supposed to do at the ranger's cabin? Safety in numbers I guess. - Well, you go back and you tell that incompetent man I can take care of myself. But... - Now, you take yourself back over And save your little girlfriend. You see, I don't mind a little one-on-one. You tell him I don't need any protection. Now you scoot, boy. I said scoot! Oh, yes, you hungry? You just hear something, Pepper? No, I didn't, sugar. Come on, supper's almost ready. Move, okay? - The generators are full for a while. That'll give us some light. - What makes you think he'll come back? What makes you think he won't? I'll help stack some more firewood. You got any food inside? Some. I'll get some from the store. I'll help. - Couldn't start any of the cars or the bikes. Plugs and wires cut or missing. Now what are we supposed to do? I don't know, ask the boss. - Honey, are you sure you're doing the right thing? I mean, not going along with the others. You're damn right I am. Besides, it was those yahoos couldn't punch Their way through a wet cracker anyway. Oh, I suppose you're right. How you want your steak? Well done. Do you smell gas? What in the hell was that? - Came form the back of the park near the river road. Oh, shit, the general. Okay, Deke, you and Merle stay here and watch. Where's Emily? Flo, where's Emily? Rick? Tom! Hello. Come on, you guys. You're scaring me. Oh, no. Go away or I'll shoot! Please, please don't hurt me. I'll be nice to you. Don't hurt me! I'll make you feel good. Put your arms around me. That's right. Like that. That's right. Not too tight, though. Oh, no, don't hurt me! You're hurting me! You're squeezing me too hard! - Got enough food to last us til morning. If we just keep our heads, stick together, We can get through this thing. - Oh, it's so easy to be self-righteous, huh, huh? - Shouldn't we call out to Emily so she can find us? - If we do that he'll know she was out there. Hopefully, she'll see the light and get in on her own. - How long before anyone comes by, Deke? Hard to say. Maybe they'll send someone tomorrow. - I just wanna know who's out there. What does he want? This is no mindless violence. This is vengeance. - Crisscrossed this valley thousands of times for 17 years. Why, huh, why didn't I ever find him, huh? - Easy, George, this isn't your fault. - I'm one of the best trackers in this parts, In the goddamned country, and I never found him. - Try and get some sleep, George. - Oh, it took 17 long years to get this park built So that I could be here all the time To keep looking, keep tracking. - Relax, old friend, try to get some sleep. - Sold your father on building this park. Told him it was gonna be for the public, for the world. It wasn't, it was for me, that's all, just me. - If George thinks my old man's intentions were any more honorable than his, he's wrong. My dad knew the best way to start Was to start slowly. Once this place took hold, he could just build around it. Ski lodges, hotels, shopping malls, the whole nine yards. - After all that's happened, I'd say Your father's plans are history. I hope so. - Hey, look, maybe this guy's through. Maybe he's finished, you know? There's no way he can get us here. Maybe... Maybe, But I doubt it. Did you hear that? What, hear what? It could've been an animal. What if it wasn't? The generators. - I'll get it, I know them backwards and forwards. Deke, wait, damn it. Merle, George, help me build up this fire. Come on! - No, no, no, stay away with that! No, no, hey, hey, man! Look out, hey! No, hey, man, hey! Oh, God! Deke! Deke! - He's gonna get every one of us, one by one. Not if we stick together. How long is it til daybreak? It's five am. It's Memorial Day. Get back, ladies! Go! Go, go! No! Look out! Get back, get back, get back! Come on! We're getting out of here. Not yet. Look, it's almost dawn. We'll have a better chance out there. We'll go cross country, but we gotta go now. Look! What are you doing? It can't be like that. Are you crazy? There's no other way. - Let's just get out of here now! - We're leaving, George, let's go. You go on. I'm staying. - Goddamn it, George, I can't just leave you here. I'll be fine. Go. Now. - I'll send for help as soon as we get back. Hang in there, boss, I'll be back for you. Ready for me now? Want me to follow you, huh? Okay. You're very good. I used to be very good myself. You'll have to do better than that. Okay, there's no weapon. Who are you? Are you Steven Webster? You recognize me? God, I sure wish I could be sure. Steve. Steven. - Can you identify this man as George Webster? That's him. - Don't worry, we'll get whoever did this. No, you won't. You can try, but you'll never find him. He knows these woods too well. If George couldn't track him after all these years, nobody can. - As far as the Sangster Corporation's concerned, This park is closed. Let it go back to wilderness.
