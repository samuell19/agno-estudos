It feels like my feelings.. are eating me up. Мамка му. Merry Christmas, bro. Hello. Hey. What? Yes. I'm on the way. I'm going. Yes. I promise. All right, bye. Hey... I thought you're feeling better. I thought we've already talked about everything. You know... We're still young. So much could still happen. If we see each other again, and, we still want each other, I'll come back to you. Let's get back together. Let's continue. Don't cry. Get dressed. I'll wait for you downstairs. I'll take you home. Okay? By the way... I'm returning everything you've given me. Thanks for these. I'll wait for you downstairs. Are you, guys, together again? That's sad. Dude, that's your first and last time with him... I'm “disliking” that. You took so long. Go up. She never looks for me. All she does is watch television. Hey, David! Have a drink. - No. I don't drink. - Hey, David! It's Christmas! “You could have spent Christmas here.” “A true friend is a Christian friend… that steers you closer to the Lord. - Samuel 23:13” “In our past readings...” It's Christmas and you're still hanging out at the computer shop. Your mom bought you a computer, so that you stay home. Have you eaten? Not yet. I'm going to fill up later during the Christmas eve dinner. Don't worry. I'm making your favorite pasta, later. I'll just finish watching this program. “Giving during Christmas ” is part of worship ” and, we should do this with happiness in our hearts. According to the Book of Psalms…” By the way. Your mom called looking for you. She said, she sent money for the holidays. I'll give you your money tomorrow. All right. “Often times, being too generous...” David. David. - Grandma. - David. What? Why haven't you changed yet. We're hearing mass. Father is waiting for us there. Waiting? Are we the only churchgoers? There you go again with your questions. Get dressed. God is waiting for us. But granny, maybe... Maybe, I don't have to go with you. I have nothing to do there, anyway. What do you mean, you have nothing to do there? Don't you know how to pray? That's a church for Christ's sakes. Get dressed, now. You'll learn a lot from Father. Listen well. Why do we need to go to church, anyway? And at night, at that. You see, it's Christmas. So? Because it's Christmas. It's merry Christmas! Get dressed. Hey, grandma, maybe... Maybe, I can... wear my red dress. You, silly thing. You're wicked. You're such a whore. Grandma, I'm all grown up. Stop pinching me. All right, wear your red dress, Father himself is going to pinch you. Get dressed. I'll wait for you outside. Faster. According to the Book of Life that says, for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have an eternal life. My brothers, God has given us a very important gift and that's His Son, Jesus Christ. And we should celebrate his birth. If you don't stop that, I am going to smash that, right now. So that we may be redeemed from our sins by Our Saviour. We have been given a holy gift. Why can't we also give something back to the Giver by remembering His birth with gladness on the day that we have received our gift. Stop that. Stop that. You're disturbing others. You pinch me like there's no tomorrow. You're embarrassing me. Listen to Father. You're embarrassing me. Do we attend the dawn masses during Christmas only to complete the nine nights? - Only to make a wish. - Grandma. - That the person we love. - I'm taking a leak. - I wasn't able to pee at home. - May love us back? Come on grandma. I'm about to burst. Do it fast. The real essence of Christmas is to remember the birth of our… David. David. David. We thank you Lord for this beautiful day. We thank you for all our loved ones... though, they're not here. Thank you for my beloved David. Hmmm. Thank you for thy bounty. And most of all, thank you for all your blessings on your birthday. Grandma, your spaghetti is so yummy. - I missed this. - Let me give you some bread. I had this on my birthday last January. Yes. Seems like long ago. For long life! Yes. Grandma, I'm carving you a piece of chicken. Choose the well done part for me. You're not allowed to eat the skin. You know my cholesterol levels are high. - I'm skinning the bird. - I'm having fruit salad later. - I've also missed your fruit salad. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Eat up, grandma. You know what, grandma, I was with my friend earlier. Really? Yeah. He says, he is going to be with his parents tonight. You should have invited him over. We have more than enough food. He probably got shy. Well, if he can't make it this year, Okay. And as for me, I'm still deciding on what to give you for Christmas. I was thinking of just buying a new red dress. I can't wear that now, grandma. I have to wait for Valentine's day. Well, if you don't want red, I can get you fuchsia. I want purple. So we'd look like sisters. Purple is my color, okay? Eat up. You know That I'd never break free That I'll never be the same From this emptiness inside of me And, you know I'll never be the same I'll never go away And now I'm here to say Ways to guide you Lie and come to Just to see How you feel Far and narrow I could take you Far away, far away Oh, light In the dark night You're good.

Hey, are you courting anyone now? - Do you have a girlfriend already? - Don't be silly, Mom. Mom, what do you mean courting? I'm not into that. Hey, I hope you don't mind. That's all I sent you. - I'll send you more before New Year. - Mom, it's fine. It's enough. I have nothing to use it on, anyway. What do you mean, you have nothing to use it on? Buy something. Or, take your girlfriend out. You, guys, have fun. Where's your grandma? Hey. Yes. Grandma! Mom wants to talk to you... on Skype. Grandma, Mom is on Skype. What a distraction. Mom, merry Christmas. My child. My child, you lost so much weight. Are you having a hard time in America? What? - Many Christmases... - Mom... - many Christmases have passed without seeing you. - Don't cry. You're making me cry. I told you, let's not cry. I can't help it. Your other siblings don't seem to care. They never call. Why don't you just come home. Come home. When? You guys are coming home? Thank God. God is good. Your son will be happy. Have you told him. It will be a surprise. Bear with me... I can't hear you very well. The train is noisy. And the tricycles, they are everywhere. But I'm glad you called. Thank you. We're doing fine here. But of course. I miss you so much. You should come home. You might not recognize your son. He's growing up so fast. What happened?

Merry Christmas, grandma. Merry Christmas. My skin is dry. Return, soon. - I will. - Okay? Take care. Hello. How much will you pay for this? Can I see it? How much are you asking it for? Around two thousand. How much? I can only give you a thousand. Two thousand. A thousand would be too much. If you want, you can sell it to the others. One thousand five hundred. That's authentic. And, I really need a little more cash right now. I can't afford it. I can only buy it for a thousand. A thousand. Yes, only a thousand. All right, then, sir. Are you, David? I'm Madonna. We've been texting. Let's go. Are you with someone? No. Are we going somewhere far? It's near. Where is the three thousand? Hey, I thought, we agreed on two thousand eight hundred. No. I said three thousand. Not two thousand eight hundred. Don't fool with me, okay? Hurry up. Here it is. Maybe, you can teach me how to use it. Look, I don't know how to use that. And, besides, we can't do it here. Take a gun lesson somewhere. What now? You know your way out, right? I can't go with you. You might have been followed. I don't want trouble. Hurry up.
