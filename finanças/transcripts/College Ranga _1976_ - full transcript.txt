Greetings to Venkappayya. Who is that? I'll break your teeth if you call me just Venkappayya. Call me warden Venkappayya. Namaskara to warden Venkappayya. What is it Krishnappa? What brings you here? I feel weird if you call me just Krishnappa. Call me oil vendor Krishnappa. So what is it? What brings you here? Came here to enquire about the status of the tender for oil supply to the hostel. Your shop seems to have bad reputation. If I sanction the tender to you now, what will answer to the committee tomorrow? See here sir. If you say I have a bad reputation, I'll agree. But don't talk about my shop's reputation like that. In the whole market, ask any hotel... ask any mess, they use our brand. Ask that run-down hotel, they use our brand. Ask that dilapidated mess, they use our brand. Why, whole of India uses our brand. Our brand oil is like melted butter. People who have used our brand oil have got their diseases... ...cured. Sir... ...if your committee members raise any objection to our brand, I'll gouge my eyes out. Oh! You think you are Bedara Kannappa(a great devotee of Shiva) to gouge your eyes out? Hey oil vendor! Before you take your eyes out, show me what you've brought for me. What do you laugh? What do you mean by that one finger? How about this? No, no. This won't do. The previous vendor was giving that much. Look sir... ...we both have to survive in this business. Who cares what happens to others? That's why. Do as I say. If you can give that much, say yes. Otherwise forget about it. OK sir. I'll come and meet you in the evening at your house. Bellulli(Garlic) Basappa, with big moustache, is waiting outside. -Who? The vegetable vendor? -Yes Call him. Come in Bellulli. Not you. You go now. -Namaskara to warden. -Come and sit down. You looked like an okra in your shop. But you look like a pumpkin here. So, what brings you? What happened to our vegetable supply tender? I'm told that you supply rotten vegetables. What do you say to that? Will hostel inmates leave me alive? They'll eat me alive. Who told you that? You keep our store vegetables for 15 days and they won't rot. They melt in the mouth. Forget about putting it in mouth. How much have you brought to grease my palm? Are you giving charity? You're very cheap. Is this the extent you can go? You are done? See here. Everyday. Supply this much to our college president's house... and a lot more to my house. What garlic? Not garlic. Vegetables. I understand sir. I told the president countless times. To put out a few more tables or provide me 2 assistants. Neither of them. In this hostel, I have to cook. And serve too. Why are you boys eating it in small bites like it's some sweet meat? If you take a bite, you know how it should be? It should be like lifting a boulder. I used to eat like that once. When I used to make a dam out of rice and pour sambar into it, I would consume 3 litres you know? What are you laughing at? Because I ate like that those days, I'm still like Bheema today. You from Bijapur. What is it you're doing? You're picking at it like a chicken. I told you several times not to smoke beedis. Your throat will go bad. Had you given me your beedis, I would have given you an extra serving for that. Eat up quickly. There's another batch waiting outside. Oh, Ramappa! You've come early today. You usually come in the third batch. That tasty Bisibelebath aroma must have dragged you in, huh? Ravi, my stomach seems to be churning. I tell you a thousand times. I tell you not to eat outside food. Do you listen to me? When did I eat? Don't lie. I can tell what and where you have eaten just by looking at the colour of your vomit. Mass vomiting. There must be some mistake with the food. What have you put in the food? Tell me. I have cooked as usual. You are lying. Hey catch him. What did I do? Haven't you done anything? Sit down. Hey what are you doing? What's the use of bathing me like this? Get hold of that vegetable vendor. Bring that grocery supplier. Drag that oil vendor here. That warden who took bribe from all three of these... bring him here first. Hey, but don't forget the president, the root cause, in all of this. We'll bring everyone. Will you bring? Very good. Bring them and do bathe them like this. Principal? It's me the president speaking. I'm told that there has been a case of food poisoning in our hostel. Yes. In our hostel. Students are vomiting. There's a big commotion there. I'm leaving now. Yes. You too come there. Don't forget. Eat! Eat! Venkappa! What's all this? This hostel is for the students. Have you all been possessed by some demon or what? Yes sir. We've sat them down here to perform exorcism. Sir. These people are responsible for all this food poisoning. Lies. This is all done by the students. To bring bad name to me, they acted as if they were vomiting, causing all this commotion, bringing us here... tied us down... and are forcing us to eat this. Yes. They must've done it. Principal! This is all your dear student Ramappa's work. Food poisoning? In our hostel? This is all a bundle of lies. Bundle of lies? I've sent all the sick students to the hospital. Doctor's certificate will be issued. Then we'll know. It is all lies or truth. President! We don't want this warden. He's killing all the students by giving them substandard food. Come what may. We don't want this warden. We can't remove him just because you ask. There's a committee of the hostel. They will decide upon it. You decide wherever you want. Decide in whichever committee you want. We don't want this warden. What's this? Look how he's talking. Ramappa. Sir? Don't make rash decisions. Let the doctor's certificate be issued. Let the president take decision in the committee. Don't cause any trouble until then. Untie and let them go. President, if we agree with them now... they'll ask to remove someone else tomorrow. Another the next day. What will happen to us if we keep dancing to their tunes? Look. Do one thing. I'll have it notified that there'll be hostel committee meeting. But... ...none of you shall come to the meeting. I'll postpone the meeting for another 15 days saying there was no quorum. We'll see what happens then. OK sir. Please convey this to other members too. That president has asked them not to come to the meeting. Come Ramappa, come Gauramma. You came. Yes sir. -Sit down. -You please sit down sir. -It's OK sit down. What will you have? Limca or Coca Cola? Or Gold Spot? No thank you sir. Ramappa. Sir? All of you... Yes sir. He must be the warden. He's the right person. Who else is there except him. Yes. Who else is there? But you see Ramappa... principal's position... professorship... and botany research along with that. When he has not enough time for all these... how can he manage the warden's job? Let him worry about it sir. Now why did you ask us to come? Coming to the point... I'm a senior and experienced man. You two demand that I be appointed the warden. Everything will be fine. If you two are willing... ...what isn't possible in this college? Huh? Come on Gauri. Ramappa. You are leaving without saying anything. Say something. -You want me to say? -Yes. -Sir. Do you think we're cattle? You think we don't know who you are and what your abilities are? What do you know about me? Tell me then. -You want me to say? -Yes. Sir. Don't. You will lose what little respect we still have for you. If Sharadamma calls, tell her I'm going to her home. Don't forget. -What is it? -Come look here. A big army has come. What army? College boys and girls have come. Don't know what they want to do to you. -Come. We'll leave from backside door. -Let me go. They can't do a thing. Let them come. I'll see what they'll do. Namaskaara sir. Ramappa, Gauramma. Why have you come? What is it? Everybody has come? We've come to ask what decision have you taken regarding the warden's position. Why have all the girls come? To show their solidarity. Oh, you want girls' solidarity, huh? Hey Ramappa, why do you want to poke your nose into all of this? Eating whatever is served in the hostel... learning whatever is taught in the college... can't you just graduate with a degree without causing a fuss? To earn a degree... they must study well, right? Yes, you're right. They must study well. To study well, they must be healthy, right? Health? It's absolutely necessary. To have a good health, shouldn't they have good food? Yes. They must have good food. Full of vitamins and proteins. Madam. In our hostel food... there's no smell of vitamins... and proteins aren't found. Hey Ramappa. Are they serving you dirt then? Instead of food? We could've managed to live if we were served dirt sir. They're killing us with poison. Sir. I beg you on behalf of all the hostel students. Remove the old warden. You are ordering me! We're the ones running the administration. We know what to do. Sir, we're the ones paying for the hostel food. We've the right to ask what we want. You have rights? Go use them. I'll shut the hostel down. Go wherever you want. Do whatever you want. Get out. In this stage of college... a serpent has come... Save us Krishna, save us... and descend upon this compound. Descend upon this compound. Hare! Krishna! Thousands died because of one Shakuni in Mahabharata... What happens when there are hundreds of Shakunis... in this stage of college... They fill darkness in the temple of knowledge. Burning the heaven of knowledge, they grow the forest of ignorance. They light the fire of division of caste and creed. When corruption is sitting with its mouth wide open, where's the place for Brahma's wife(Saraswati-Goddess of knowledge)? In this stage of college... Namaskara sir. Shanti(Peace)! Shanti! You called me sir? Not you. Sorry sir. I said maintain peace. OK boys. OK girls. From now on... The last one was irresponsible. From now on... Is it? I'll call the professor and enquire. -You go to your classes. -Thank you sir. -Good. What is it Karataka and Damanaka? Congratulations sir, congratulations. What for? We heard that you were appointed the hostel warden. What's it to you? We think it would be better if other accountants are appointed for the hostel. Who asked for your advice? Forgive us. The present one is a corrupt hand. We don't want your name to be tarnished. That's all. For hostel inmates' food, good quality rice, good pulses, fresh vegetables, to find all these items and bring, to keep proper accounts of all these, to look after the mess activities, an honest man... ...must be appointed is what we are reminding you. That's all. I too know that. If you permit us, Cheluvayya and I will look after hostel accounts too. What do you say Cheluvayya? Work in both places. It will be difficult. OK, we shall adjust. Most importantly, our principal must make a good name. Don't you people have even a little bit of shame? You are the rats that ate paper and bulbs in the stores. Now would you spare the grains and pulses in the hostel? Go, go. Go and attend to your work. Don't waste my time. I should have become the principal, shouldn't I have? Definitely sir. That Devaiah, getting Ramappa and Gauramma on his side, getting all the college students on his side, getting them to protest for him, he got the principal's post. Let him get it. Let him die with it. Our college hostel... -...warden post should have been offered to me. Don't you think? -Definitely sir. After this Devaiah became principal, does he give any respect to our college president? He doesn't. Why? Because he belongs to our community. Does he like you? No, he doesn't. Why? Because we don't wear the uniform. No, not because of the uniform. It's because you belong to our community. He spews venom at me. Why? Because I belong to your community. Should we salute to these people everyday? It's not possible. -Siddu. -Sir? To make Devaiah leave our college on his own, we must do something. -OK sir. -Very good. -Siddu. -Sir? Come and meet me tomorrow before you go to college. Good night boys. Sir... What is it Somu? It's OK, you can tell me. Whenever you speak, you keep speaking of our community, right? What do you mean by our community? You idiot. Siddu, come here. Take this idiot to Cubbon park, sit him down under a tree... and teach him what does our community mean. Hey come now. Hey, What do you think Kannada is? Kannada is great. You tell him that. Let me go. What do you Tamil is then? Tamil is the great language. Do you know that? You go. You go. Is there any language like Telugu? Telugu is brilliant. Telugu is brilliant. Hey boy. I know better, you go. Kannada and hey you Tamil. Do you know my language? Malayalam. There is no other language like Malayalam. Do you know? O Kannada! Come here. Come here. O Tamil, come here. Come here. Telugu, would you come here? Come here. Malayalam. Come here. Have you no work? To each his mother tongue is great. More than anything, friendship, love is greater. You all study in the same college. You all live in the same hostel. If you don't think that we are all one... ...what is the use of your education? If I find you fighting again on language, caste, or creed, I will kick you out of the hostel. Go. Go and study. Behave properly. -Sir. -Sir. Sir. Sir. There's an urgent matter. It's very confidential sir. What is it? Principal, taking leave for 6 months, is going to a foreign country. Is it? Then who's going to be next? That's why we've come. What? You? Not us sir. We've come to alert you to get ready for that job. Don't you understand sir? You put a word to the president. And you'll be sitting in that chair. Wonderful idea. [A scholar and a king,] [can never be compared.] [A king is only respected in his kingdom,] [whereas a scholar is respected all over the world] -Sir, we have arranged a farewell party for you at 5.30 in the evening. You must come. Why all this Sheenappa? What do you mean sir? You're our college's proud professor. It is an honour for us to honour you. Alright, I'll come. What is this sir? You're securing all your property? Definitely. That is result of 5 years of research. Definitely that is his asset. You are perfectly correct Sheenappa. This body will perish one day. But, this asset won't die. As a result of my work as a professor, to our next generation of students, if this should be of some help, my life would be well lived. Certainly sir. Quite right sir. Thank you, thank you. Madam and President, please accept this. Amma, the time I wished for has come. Principal's post is empty. You must appoint me to that post. You mustn't say no. Why have any doubt now? If Devaiah is gone then the post is yours. It's not like that Amma. A person with a doctorate must be selected for principal's post, is what committee members are all thinking. There is such a rumour doing rounds. They've not given me a doctorate. Why do you worry about that? Committee members are all my husband's puppets. If he says yes, they say yes. If he says no, they say no too. But... ...President hasn't said yes yet. What do you say? Adavaiah's matter? Yes or no? Amma. Amma. Look here. Adavaiah's matter... Say yes. Adavaiah. Sir President. Krishna come quickly. Are you ready? Are you ready? -Steady. -Just a minute. Smile a bit sir. You turn your face that way. Steady. Is it OK Krishna? [Crowd] OK! OK! Go to your classes. Sir, another? Another? Alright. Sir put your hand here. Steady. Krishna, you must get the photos by this evening. Sir. I... belong to your community. Is it? Then why didn't tell me until today? Sir. I too belong to your community. -Is it? -No sir. He's lying. He's does not belong to our community. What is this? You are lying? Let it go. Look Rangaswamy. I am sitting in this chair now. From now on, the work that must be done, how they must be done, and where they must be done must all be told to me by you. That we will do without fail. Go and take care of your work. Oh, I don't want it sir. I don't want it. It's not for you. Everybody gets excited when it comes to garlands. Shouldn't one think if he's worth it? Take this and deliver it safely to my home. Where are the rest? Everybody has gone to the airport to give send off to principal Devaiah. The whole college is empty sir. What? -The whole college is empty? -Yes sir. Jawara. Hey Jawara! Sir? Tell all the students who have gone to the airport to wait for me near my office after they return. -Siddu. -Sir? -Sangya. -Sir? Nanju, Somu. You are my only students. I will teach only you. Tomorrow. Jawara. Bring a chair. Stand up on the chair. Silence. Who is it that told me to stand up on the chair? It is I sir. You won't be visible if you sat on the chair. That's why I said so. Shut up. Where had you people been without telling anyone? We have gone to bid farewell to our principal at the airport. Why? Was yesterday's party not enough? You had gone to the airport bunking the classes? It's our love for him sir. -If you are going tomorrow, we will send you off in the same way. -Shut up. Disobedient rascal. Each one of you must be severely punished. And your uniforms... Are you the police or military to wear uniform? And that too yellow coloured. Look at other college students. How trim and tidy they are. How they wear fashionable dresses. And look at their hairstyles. It is such a joy to see those girls. And you. Everybody is yellow coloured. Like sanyasins. Asses you are! What did you say sir? I said asses. Rangaswamy. One cannot make out the difference between you and an ass. In screaming. An ass does another thing very well. I know that too. What is it? This! Cheluvayya. Read it. Heads of the departments meeting. Subject. Indiscipline in college. College administration system... ...has broken down. In this institution... ...discipline has died. You are not discharging your duties properly. Whom are you making these allegations on? On whom? On you. On your lecturers. Take that back sir. You are the one running the system here. If it is broken, that's because of you. You said discipline is dead in this institution. It's not dead in the institution but in you. Some students who roam around as your disciples, Discipline is dead in them sir. You are alleging that we have no dedication to work. Is it right? Who is coming to college when they please? You or us? Sending someone else to teach in classes, who sleeps in the office? You or us? You fool. You are behaving as you please without considering your positions. Who am I? I am this college's principal. Principal. Senior in knowledge and age. You are not giving the respect that is due to this position. Yes. Do you think the principal is your student? Seethamma. Those who seek respect must also learn respect others. Master? Kannada Master? You too want respect? I will send it. I will send the respects to all of you through memo. Seethamma, you come. Let him send. To all professors, To all professors, Through this... Through this... it is informed that... it is informed that... your conduct... your conduct... is not at all... is not at all... satisfactory. satisfactory. Over the students... Over the students... over the lecturers... over the lecturers... your control... your control... is being lost. is being lost. Everywhere... Everywhere... indiscipline... indiscipline... is rampant. is rampant. For all this, For all this, professors are responsible. professors are responsible. Day before yesterday... Day before yesterday... in the staff meeting... in the staff meeting... you all... you all... ...have behaved very indecently. ...have behaved very indecently. Sir. I wasn't there sir. It's for them. Them? OK. ...have behaved very indecently. To this... To this... if an apology... ...is not tendered, forthwith... on you... appropriate action... ...will be taken. All of this dictated in Kannada... ...must be translated into English. Issue it to all the professors. Why sir? Don't they know Kannada? Hey, it is the rule. All memos shall be in issued in English. OK sir. Are you going to see the limp? Why are you tendering the apology fearing him? Tell him you won't. You just come with me to the president's house. I'll talk to him. Go, go. You're one crook. Master. Kannada master. Don't put yourself into situations where you have to tender apologies again. We haven't come across any such situation. And won't come across in future too. That is not the apology, Mr Adavaiah. Our resignations. Rangaswamy. What is it? Hey Rangaswamy. What is it? Rangaswamy. Who am I? You are the principal. You are aware that I'm the principal? Are you in your right mind? Why sir? Why? You have issued a memo to me too like other professors? It's not me. Cheluvayya issued it. -Cheluvayya? -Yes. Are you the one who issued the memo to me? You had ordered to issue memos to all the professors. In that list... ...your name was also there. So, automatically you've got one too. Shut up. Am I the professor or the principal now? True sir. You're the principal. But... ...your name is permanently on that list as history professor, right? Whatever it might be, your principal position... ...is only temporary, right? I'm temporary... ...and you're permanent, are you? Come here. Come. Come! Sir. These are the resignations of those three. Do you see now sir? I made them to resign themselves. How's it? Good, good. Sir. -Where is Amma? -Why do you want her? While talking college business... ...I have ordered her not to be present. Come here. She has eyes on my seat. She wants to be college president. Does she? -Good, good. -What? Sir. For the positions that'll now be vacant... ...we shall appoint our own people. What do you say? I've made arrangements for that sir. Three people. See... Each will give 10 thousand. Three times ten is thirty. Adavaiah. -It's very less. -Sir. I'm hearing Amma's voice. Thirty is very less. Think about it yourself. Adavaiah. We shouldn't make hasty decisions. If we send these off immediately... ...and appoint our own... ...that is not diplomacy. Now. There are vacant positions for lecturers in some departments, right? You can appoint them to those positions. For the same rate. Then what about these resignations? We must not send them off accepting these. I'll convince them to take their resignations back. We must appoint our lecturers to their departments. They must be there. These must be there too. Divide and rule policy. I understand sir. Dilip Kumar. Ask only a few questions. That too if you want. Am I right sir? Ask one or two. Don't waste time. Talk less and work more. Yes sir. Talk less and work more[in Kannada} That is what I'm saying. Krishnappa, first your department. Mathematics. -Rangaswamy. -Sir? -Call Vasantamurthy. -OK sir. Vasantamurthy, Vasantamurthy, Vasantamurthy. -Is this a court? -No, sir. He has come sir. Ah, have a look at this. This is his application. What is your name? He has written it in the application, sir. I too know that. But still... ...we should check if it's the same person. Yes sir. Like ration card. Yes, we must be very careful. What is your name? My name is Vasantamurthy, sir. I'm the same person who wrote that application. Ask a question. Do you know Dr. Ramanujam? I know sir. He has a clinic in my neighbourhood. He has a very good practice. Do you know how many diseases he has cured? Very good. What is good about it? My karma. I'm asking about the famous mathematician, Dr. Ramanujam. Do you know anything about him? Yes sir. He is a famous mathematician. Very good. Have you ever taught mathematics before? What question is this? He must be given an opportunity to teach. Yes sir. If not given an opportunity no talent can shine. Now take your case. You got the opportunity and your talent is shining now. I'll ask you a simple question. Recite the multiplication table of 19. 19 times 1 is 19... 19 times 2 are 38... 19 times 3 are 36... 19 times 4 are 66... Isn't it 76? Both are right for each other. Do students come to college to learn multiplication tables? Sorry sir. You're asking something he learnt in his childhood. Yes sir. One shouldn't what anybody has done in their childhood. Now I don't remember the tables. So am I unfit to be the principal? Rangaswamy. -Give him the appointment order. -OK sir. -What do you say? -OK sir. You please sit there. I'll come. Thanks, Namaskara. Sheenappa, it's your English now. I know. Rangaswamy. Call Gajendrappa. Gajendrappa. If you announce a name like that again, I'll send you to court. Gajendrappa has come, sir. Please sit down, sir. Ask whatever you want to ask. You ask him yourself. He's being appointed to your department. You ask him. It should be simple. OK sir. What is the spelling of cycle? Answer. What are you looking at me for? -C Y C L E. -Good. Psychology? If you put logy in front of cycle... ...it'll become Psychology, sir. Then... ...what is P S Y C H O L O G Y? Piscology sir. -Rangaswamy. -Should I type the appointment order? Water. Why are you getting up? It's over. You can appoint him. [Jawara, principal wants a glass of water] It's psychology, is it not? P is silent in it, is it not? You're saying piscology. Don't say like this in front of students. They will squeeze you like anything. Go. Kannada master, please come here. Now Kannada. Look. Ask simple questions on contemporary literature. Don't startle him by asking about some ancient poets. OK sir. Rangaswamy. Call Dilip Kumar. Don't shout. Call him softly. He has come. Who is Kuvempu? He is a great poet, sir.[without enunciation] -What kind of poet? -Great poet. What all has he written? -He has written poems, sir. -Good. Can you recite one of his poems? [Sings a film song without proper pronunciation] Is this Kuvempu's poem? Does it matter? Look at the way he recites it. If he teaches like this, which student wouldn't be able to understand? Yes they will understand. I have written a few poems, sir. Come on, recite. Train chuka chuka... Laughter paka paka... Eating baka baka... Dancing thaka thaka... Bangles gulu gulu[clinking] Water stream jhulu jhulu... Laughter kulu kulu... What is this? You said laughter paka paka that time but you say laughter kulu kulu now? Paka paka is masculine laughter. Kulu kulu is feminine laughter. He's a treasure trove of knowledge. -Should I give him the appointment order, sir? -Give him. What injustice is this? Why? You selected someone who doesn't know multiplication tables for mathematics. You selected someone who doesn't know spelling for English. At least couldn't you have selected someone able for our mother tongue Kannada? If these kind of people are appointed, what is the fate of students and the reputation of college? What can we do? It's the recommendation from top. If we don't listen to them, both of us won't be there. Our college has gone down the drain these days, Gauri. The lecturers who teach these days. The lessons they teach. Makes me think why am I even attending the classes. Ramu. What if we do one thing? What? Making all the lecturers sit on the bench... ...we will teach them ourselves. I think that'll be better. If it continues like this... what do we write in our exams... ...and how do we graduate? We shall just pass time. That's all. It's a joke to you. If the college continues to run like this.. what about college reputation... ...and the results? That Ganga shall save us. Cheluvayya. Exam results shall be discussed today. What percentage of marks shall be considered as pass? ...Is the topic of discussion today. Let the discussion begin. It would be better if the principal makes his decision known. Why have this discussion if I was to decide? Why waste these biscuits and fruits? Say something. Without affecting the reputation of our college, ...we shall maintain the academic standards. That is my opinion. We shall not promote any students who fail to secure the pass marks. That is my opinion. If one has to pass in university exams, ...there is a rule that says one has to secure 40% marks. My opinion is that we should adopt the same. If we follow that rule, ...not even 10 students will pass. Then the management will know that classes aren't being taken properly. And will dismiss me. We have ourselves complained to you that classes aren't being taken properly in this college. Why aren't the classes taken? It's because good lecturers haven't been appointed. Mr. Krishnappa. You cannot insult our principal like that. This is fact. There is no question of insult at all. This discussion is going out of way. This is not the topic we are discussing. Today's topic of discussion... 'What percentage of marks shall be considered as pass?' is the topic of discussion today. Come to the point. In some colleges, ...I've heard that they won't fail anybody. Why don't we pass everyone like that? Are you in college or free pass issuing office? If we start promoting students like this, our academic standards will drop. What will happen to our college's prestige and reputation? Then... It would be better if the principal... ...makes his decision known. Good. Let's do it this way. Whoever... ...secures less than 10% of marks, ...we shall only declare them as fail. Who would get less than 10% marks in our college? There are madam, there are. One in domestic science, another in botany. Who are those gems? In domestic science, Nirmala. What happened? Sir. Nirmala... ...is her daughter, sir. What a pity. Who's that in botany? In botany, your son Nataraja. [Reciting old Kannada poem- apparently badly] This poem's prosody... ...is very difficult. You won't understand this. So... ...you vomit this poem[he means omit]. What is that? I vomited the poem. Silence. Is Kannada class a joke to you? We aren't joking, sir. Knowing that our Kannada class... ...has been brought down to this level, we are really happy.[Sarcastically] Come. Come sit down. What is this sir? Even when they're entering the class half an hour late... ...you're allowing them? Hey, you sit down quietly. What did you lose? Students make mistakes. They're your classmates too, aren't they? Yes sir. Until evening... ...they're our classmates. After that... ...they're your glassmates. What did you say? Swine! In the glorious tradition of Bharat... there was gurukul... Between the guru and his disciples... there was devotion and respect... It was the ancient times... ...a time of sages and scholars. There is no difference between a guru and his disciples... devotion and respect is not to be found at all... It's all about powerful students today... ...and about crooked minded teachers. This is 20th century... This is 20th century. Teaching was a duty to the country... for the gurus of that time... A monthly salary... and some bribe to go with that... ...is what today's teachers are after. This is 20th century... This is 20th century. Gurus were gods to the students of those times... But today the teachers themselves are controlled by the wealthy students. This is 20th century... This is 20th century. In the glorious tradition of Bharat, there was gurukul... Rules and morals... Discipline and patience... is what gurus of those times taught... Speaking with bullets... And knives... Speaking with bullets and knives... are the morals of today's students... This is 20th century... This is 20th century... If you make a donation... promotion will be granted... ...is the motto of this institution. This college has become... ...just a degree granting machine today. This is 20th century... This is 20th century. In the glorious tradition of Bharat, there was gurukul... Between the guru and his disciples, there was devotion and respect... It was the ancient times... ...a time of sages and scholars. We want good teachers... We want good teachers... We want good teachers... We want good teachers... We want good teachers... You all are being deceived by these rowdy Ramappa's words. It would be good for you if you all stopped this and attended the classes. Otherwise... I'll give you mass punishment. We want good teachers... We want good teachers... We want good teachers... Sir. If you want to do any good to the students... ...please step down from the principal's chair. Ramappa. Who are you to tell me that? Learn to give respect... I wanted very much to give you all the respect, sir. But you have lost your dignity. Ramu. Ramaswamy. Ramanna. I'm telling you nicely. Don't talk about my dignity. Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk. Why shouldn't I? You are the one who destroyed this college. In the name of recommendation... you took bribes... and appointed useless lecturers. You sowed seeds of hatred amongst the students. You made us to fight against each other. The relation between the student and his teacher... went down to the level of a beer bottle. You are the one who allowed that to happen. You must step down from the principal's chair. I stepped down. I only stepped down from the fountain. Don't think it is this easy... ...to remove me from the principal's chair. Ramappa. Gathering all this crowd... if you damage the college property... you know very well what will happen next. I know, sir. We are not that rotten lot to do such things. To break this temple of guru is same as.. ...betraying one's own mother. There was someone called Mahatma Gandhi... you know him,sir? Ramappa. You ignorant. You are asking our professor, our history professor, about Mahatma Gandhi? When one can't tolerate the injustice... what has Gandhi asked us to do? Peaceful Satyagraha[Protest]. Once more please. Peaceful Satyagraha. That is what we're going to do now. You'll do Satyagraha? All of you will do Satyagraha? Ramappa. I have suspended you. Come on. Students are still outside, sir. Even if Ramappa is forcing them to go back to classes, no one's ready to come back. Let them go to hell. Sir. You are saying this? -You're the principal. -Not any more. There is threat to even that now. What is this new threat? What is the date today? 20th. He's coming back today. Who sir? Devaiah. I've received the cable. Let him come. Let him come? I will have to step down as soon as he's here. So what? So what? What are you saying? Sir. Sir. You are the history professor. Have you read the Betaal stories? What is the relation between the Betaal stories and this? Rangaswamy. What is it? We can't change his fate. Let's go. What is it? What is it? Have you read Betaal stories? Yes I have read. In that... the witches... used to... put their lives inside the snakes, birds and what not and preserve them. In the similar way, your opponent Devaiah... has secured his life somewhere near. If we hit him here... he will die there. What is it? Come, I'll tell you. This is where Devaiah's life is. For 5-6 years, he has tirelessly worked and written his research documents... ...and has saved it here. This is his only property. If this is destroyed... he will be permanently in the mental asylum. And your principal's position will be permanent. Ramappa, our principal has come. Why? You are standing outside and not attending classes. Sir. Ramu has been suspended from attending classes. That is why we haven't attended any. Why have they suspended you? Sir. After you had gone... not one thing has gone right in this college. Fire! Devaiah's lab has caught fire! Would fire extinguish itself if you keep screaming like this? Call everyone to douse the fire. Go! Go bring the water! -Sir! -No! Leave me! Did you extinguish the fire? Did you extinguish the fire? The fire is extinguished, sir. Is it over? OK. Mr. Devaiah. I'm really sorry, very sorry. How did the lab catch fire? Fire... was here. One spark... lit the fire there. Mr. Adavaiah. At least now, may the fire that is burning here... ...may die. What do you mean? Your bad luck that this happened. How can you doubt me for this? No, no. I don't like this. It is an insult to me. It may be an accident. Sir. Sir. Sir. Where are you going, sir? From today. I'm going to beg for money. Beg? Yes. I'll build a college by begging. Where there is no fight for power... Where there is no partiality... Where there is no corruption... Where the students can learn with joy... I'll build such a college. I'll build such a college. I'll build such a college.
