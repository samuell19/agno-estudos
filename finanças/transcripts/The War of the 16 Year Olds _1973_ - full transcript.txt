WAR AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN That was a really scary face! As if you saw your lover run away with someone else. Or saw yourself dead. All I saw was feet with little crabs clinging to them. Crabs? - How old are you? - 16. 16? It makes me really jealous! Why? I'd really like to start over from the age of 16. I see. Let me guess. You must be really talented, if you worked with Mr. Ueno as a magazine photographer. But you got bored with your work and went traveling to unknown places. But that's only on the surface. You must have had a quarrel with your wife and ran away. I don't have a wife. Well, your lover then... A trip to feel free. A trip to find your true self again. You want to start all over again. But it's impossible. Why is it? Because the girl you're secretly hoping for will come and find you. I don't want to listen. I just want to go to the train station. Where are you going? To the train station. The sea is really close. It takes no time to get there. But I know you won't jump into the sea, That's the way it is. When people kill themselves at home, they can't be forgiven. Come with me! Where? To my home. There's no one there. Hey, wait a second. I'm just passing here on my way. How to say it... This morning, I was trying to see my fate. I knew I would meet you. And I knew you would come to my home. What is this place? To-yo-ka-wa. Toyokawa. It's just the name of the river. OK, how about racing all the way? Alright! Come on, faster! It's very inconsiderate to your guests to bring them without giving us any warning. This girl, she's always like this! Well, it's not that terrible! We've already grown used to receiving guests like this. Please, sit down. Thank you! All right. Oh, Aluna.... Thank you. - How is he doing? - He doesn't eat, as usual. I see. He didn't come out at all today. You think it's all right? It's not good to keep oneself locked inside the whole day. Then I'll go have a look a little later. Please help yourself, before it gets cold. 0h, these are escargots. The ones they brought over. It's snails. You can eat a lot of different stuff here. Like snakes or lizards... Stop speaking nonsense. But it's true, Dad likes kangaroo tail the most. What do you think? Do you like it? Yeah, it's very nice. Well, then it's alright. Some people never get used to eating this. Look! Is it OK? He can't stand hot weather. No problem, he doesn't need to work anyway. Azuna! 0h, it's really hot! By the way, what were you talking about? It's just Azuna saying something strange. She's always like this. I went to the town hall this morning. I saw the family registry. Why don't you tell me the truth? I don't know what you're talking about? About my older brother! He was born when you were 16. He was with you until the age of three, before you abandoned him. Stupid, what are you saying? That's not the kind of information you could find in registry... I don't recall giving birth to any child other than you. It's time. All right. Dad! I'm really busy these days. I can't sit here listening to your nonsense. Please enjoy your meal. OK, if my parents don't want to listen to me, I can do everything later on my own. Azuna we've got a guest here! We can also make a baby. This way, you'll know what I'm talking about. Look, why are you so fond of making trouble? You're always trying to fool me! - Enough of that! - I really hate you! Then... I'll... I'll have to take my leave... Well, if you're not in a hurry, you could just stay. It doesn't bother me. Alright. There are 1,800,000 square meters here. The Toyokawa. arsenal of the Japanese navy. To this day, it remains the largest facility of its kind in Asia. In a single assault on the 7th of August 1945, 2477 honorable lives were lost here. Only after that, peace made its way here. So, I thought that, in the future, this place could be transformed for the needs of peacetime industry. I had to invest some effort to set up production of peacetime goods. Now, peacetime commodities are produced here for everybody's needs. Tell me... if you look at it all the time like this, you feel like the water will absorb you. Why is it? Whenever it comes to this time of the day, I just can't calm down. The sixth sense, you know about it? The sixth sense? It's like with very sensitive people. For them, there may be many ghosts all over this place. Don't scare me like that! It's true! It's an old story. I saw a ghost coming to this pond. He appeared at the other side. In that forest, there is a large cemetery. That day... it was dark... As it is now... Tell me... Did you really see crabs? - But how can you be so sure? - It must be so. - How would you know. - I just do. Why? Because... I'm not having any period... It doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant. I'm sure about it. But, if I am really pregnant, what are we gonna do? We don't even know for sure... But if I am... Are you gonna marry me? But you must confirm it first. What's wrong? What will happen to us? I'd better just die. I wonder if they decided to die... when the sun was going down, like now. But it seems really strange. It feels as if I've already had this conversation with you before... What are you doing? No way! I've got orders from my superiors! What the hell are you saying? I've caught you! I can't see! I can't see! Wake up! What's going on? One captain committed suicide. Most of the navy perished. This is the news I receive. You must be having a nightmare. Open your eyes. You're heavy! Go away, come on! Who the hell are you? Should I call everybody? I belong to this family. This family? Yeah. What are you afraid of? When did it happen? No... I'm really scared. Scared? She will die! Die? Who? Azuna. She wants to kill herself. What? She has tried four times already. I know. And I want you to stop her. Will you help? She's important to me. My sweet niece... She shouldn't die! Your niece? So you are...? Right! I'm her uncle. I must take my leave, sir! Azuna went to school early. Even though it's summer holidays, there is one class held each week. Really? I see. Even though I also was a teenage girl once, I absolutely cannot understand what's going through her mind. When you were 16, it was... 1945... The last year of the war. But our youth wasn't at all like theirs. Air raids every day. We didn't know when we were going to die. But we didn't dare to be afraid of death. No. We didn't have any fear of death by that time. When I mention it to these kids, they just can't believe it! 1945... That's when I was born! Speaking of being 16, I lost my mother when I was 16. She was a wonderful mother. After that I was left alone with my dad. Not like a father and his son. We lived together like friends. My father was a worker. He was considered an important person there. He also passed away during winter that year. But they were not my real parents. I see... Then... what about your real parents? But I remember when I was a child someone came to visit. He told me something about my mother. He mentioned some place. Then, later, after my parents passed away, I suddenly remembered all this. I was trying so hard to remember the name of that place. But I couldn't. No, I couldn't. I don't know why I'm talking about this... This room must be affecting me. It's so quiet! But... come to think of it... People are really irresponsible. The things we absolutely have to remember, If we know it might hurt us, We simply forget them... But it's very hard to live on, if we keep clinging to the past. I know that... But... if... let's say... If you suddenly lose Azuna, would you be able to forget that, too... I see she's drawn a lot of your attention. She's not really self-destructive. She just wants to play with me. To play? Yes. When I was 16, I was in the midst of a real war. What she's doing now is just a war game. We'll go for a picnic tomorrow. It has been already arranged. Would you like to come with us? However, if we must take those few characters as an example, There's something special about them. First of all, the majority of characters are dead, departed souls. There is no precedent in this world for gathering such a huge army of dead people. Furthermore, these departed spirits, when they face outsiders, they express the great pain of not having died completely. It's a very special feature. Of course, it's not that the others can't participate. But, this way, the atmosphere may become hostile. Or they can maintain gentle conduct. We can talk about how people stand in relation to their neighbors. If they can live on, they are very much like characters on a stage. They take one step from the kingdom of the dead. Coming towards the broad daylight. On the other hand, those who approach death in this world... They can come forward in two lines. Those unfortunate ghosts, one after another... They march incessantly into the utter darkness. Such is the fate of men, full of hardships. Only those who feel it through... with their whole heart... and pray to the dead in their world. Only they attain decency. Hey, you're going back? Yeah, see you later. I see... you're not going then? There is a deserted island with a temple in the bamboo grove. We've gotta explore it! We could... Would you join us? Of course! What about Tuesday? I'll be going out for a picnic with my family. Dad took some days off especially for that. We could do it some other day... So, have you finished your novel? 0h!, I did! Do you want to read it? No, thanks. I'm too lazy. What is it about? Here I am! You scared me to death! What are you looking at? Clouds. Clouds? If you keep looking like this, you can see all kinds of shapes. Very interesting. You're right! The biggest one looks like a gorilla. Or that one... it looks like Tea Pot. [nickname given to bald people] Tea pot? That's what we call a teacher at school. But if you stare like this, the sky seems really big. Of course, it's big! The Universe is boundless. It has the Solar System, and the Milky Way. And other places, too. Like Andromeda... Little worlds we know nothing about. Countless. And the whole body of the Universe keeps expanding gradually. After millions of years, the Universe will shrink. In the end, everything will turn into gas and disappear. But then it will reappear, and the Universe will swell and become as it is today. And this will be repeated infinitely. Like a heartbeat. Human beings are so small compared to the Universe... In a wink, you're born and you die again. And, in that short while, you keep looking at your mother Universe. Just like we're doing now. Human life is so short... But there are so many interesting things in it! Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si.... What are you praying for? I am asking to become an adult sooner. That way you'll turn into a granny pretty soon. I'd really like to have the time run a little faster. Nobody can pass over 60 years within one day. Gods can do that! 5 years have passed, 5 years have passed, 5 years have passed, 5 years have passed. Alright, I am now 88! No, only 30! OK! 5 years have passed... I am now 104. I understand! I am... 104 now! I really like you! What was it that you just understood? That, after death, we can be born again. No... we can't do anything against the laws of the Universe. It's so scary! But can you tell me the truth? Who are you? I am not sure how to say... lam... I've been wrong in seeing my fate. It looked like you were supposed to take me away. It wasn't clear where. It's really all the same, wherever you go. What is she like? Who? The girl you were with before. She looks like my mother, doesn't she? For sure. How old is she? 24. She's grown-up. Then... do you really like me? Yeah. You don't want to swim? Nobody comes here. What is she like? Tell me! What's her hair like? Why did you quarrel? It's all in the past. I wanna swim! Your uncle told me you don't want to live. He must have been talking about himself. It's him who tried to commit suicide four times. Mother stopped him three times, and father one time. Also, he's not my uncle. He's Mom's ex-husband! And that huge house is really his. And... you? What is it? Have you seen it too? Have I seen what? I've really seen it. Something golden was flying there. You've all seen it, right? Mommy! You're just seeing things. Do you know about the navy discipline? No... did you box while in the navy? No, not boxing, kendo!! I was a champion! In kendo., once you close your eyes, you lose! You shouldn't look down on your opponent! But if you take your eyes off him, you lose! And it goes on! Suddenly, you see a sword next to your jaw. You've gotta dodge. And then, you've gotta snatch a chance and hit! You get it? This way he'll lose! Yeah, he'll lose! It's the sea! Look, it's the sea! - Come on, uncle! - OK. Look! The scenery is so good! This morning, before going to the sea, I was trying to see Dad's fate. So, are their any pleasant surprises to look forward to? On the contrary! Then, I'd better not hear about that. Can it be that you're gonna carelessly lose something precious? Azuna! Dad has found a way to go out especially for you! Nobody can change fate! Speaking of what's precious, here it is. I got it from my uncle. Eh? One hand dropped off... A watch without a hand... is it not destiny? There's something still more precious. Can it be that you and Mom don't love each other? What are you talking about? I am asking you seriously! What's the use of thinking about such nonsense?! Mother will live a long life! That's not what I'm saying! - Do you love each other? - Of course, we do! Why did you marry? Waiter, bring me one more cup of coffee, please. Well, can you tell me more about how you got married? Right after the war, we didn't have in our heads all the mess you have now. We just wanted to survive, and even that was hard. Let's talk about something else! Look, isn't the sea beautiful? So hot! Even when the wind is blowing. I really can't stand summer! I think about so many things... That's not good! What are you thinking about? I've remembered the name of that place. Really? What is it called? No... But that place doesn't exist anymore. What are you talking about? A long time ago, there was a little elephant, who lost his way. To find his mother, he entered a forest. But because it wasn't the same forest, there were no elephants there. So, the little elephant was trying to find his mother's route. He passed through 28 cities, but couldn't find the right one. I know, you're making fun of me. I am not an idiot! The little elephant is gonna collapse soon. I don't wanna listen. I don't want any more explanations. Life is always like taking a wrong train many times. And you can't get off wherever you want. You can't just get back on the previous train. That you can remember the name of the previous train doesn't change anything. You're all lying to me, hiding everything from me. Azuna! Azuna! Don't come closer! I told you not to come closer! Leave me alone! I hate you! Let go of me! What the hell are you doing? Did you not say you wouldn't lose your life carelessly? I suddenly thought, back in Toyokowa.... Me too, so... Let's go back! - Don't hold me, I won't die. - Cool down! So hard, so hard! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! What's the matter? Are you OK? - I want to die! - Cool down! Let me go! Let me go! Please, calm down! It's OK, it's OK! The war is already over. I know, I know. Because I've lost my honor... I don't want to live. Kill me! Kill me! Stop speaking nonsense! Stop speaking nonsense! No, don't take me to a hospital! I don't want it! No, it's not true, you've made this up. Hurry, go back! I won't go back. Come and save me! Help me! Save me! Lie, it's all a lie! Listen to this order! For the sake of winning the war, for the sake of saving your fatherland, Give all your life and all your strength... Fighting on the battlefield... Let's go back home. We can come here some other day. That's awful. Don't you think so? Why is it wrong? Why don't you want me as your wife? There are so many couples like us. All these couples hurt each other. That's just an excuse. Tell me the truth. Do you like someone else? Who is it? Who do you have in your heart? My heart is empty. It has been empty for a long time. Can't you hear how empty it is? What are you looking for? You got so sweaty. Is it Mom? I don't know. A map, a timetable? Let me try to see your fate. That's right, you've been looking for that woman you left. Though you don't realize it yourself, the cards show it. No, it's nothing like that. What is it then? I'm not sure. Then, also... how should I say it? A long time a go, I read a novel like that. I was very much affected by it. By that story of a man from a desert. I'm quite a bit like him. Though I can't say it clearly. Then, what's drawing you? The vision of this dead couple we saw? Or... I don't know! I told you I don't know! Then, let me tell you. It's my mom! You've fallen in love with her! You're so stupid! Your fate is that good, look! Why don't you tell him the truth? It's very cruel to him! What are you talking about? He's been looking for his mom all along. Falling in love, and considering marriage, he was always thinking about meeting her! That's how it is! I don't know what you're talking about. He loves you! I can't forgive it! I understand everything! Wait, Azuna! Jin, you're so stupid! What am I? Tell me! What am I doing? Azuna... Azuna... Azuna! Open the door! Azuna! Something happened! Go call Dad! Come on! Hurry! Azuna! What are you doing? Open the door! Azuna! Azuna! Don't worry about me! What are you doing? That's too much for just being silly. I'm not playing a game. Azuna! Open the door! What are you doing? Open the door! Azuna! Go away, I'll burst it! Goddamn! Azuna! Azuna! Open! Azuna! No! Open all the windows real quick! Azuna, what are you doing? I hope you all understand! This shouldn't happen again! Don't even dare to think about it! Not even once! Don't leave! You really want to leave me without caring a bit? Should I come back to my previous everyday life? The morning comes, the night comes... The morning comes, the night comes... Everyday, the same things happening. I was always waiting for this... like Cinderella. Something different happened today. I hoped you could come and save me. Please... I'm begging you! He") me! What if I tell you I'm leaving? I'll try to kill myself again... Can you come tonight? I'll wait for you at the old place. What are you doing up there? Tonight we'll send the souls back to the hereafter. 2477 souls. Tonight, they'll all go back. They will take me with them. That's why I'm waiting here. Azuna died in the Toyokawa air raid just after she gave birth to you. She was 16. She was still just a young girl. What are you talking about? What did you just say? Nothing. She's my only beloved niece. I don't want to lose her. Hello! Daddy! 0h, Azuna, it's me! - Daddy, you don't know about it? - About what? About Mom and that guy? I've seen it with my own eyes. What are you talking about? I'm very busy now. You don't believe me? Come tonight to the little shed in our backyard. Your Majesty Heavenly Emperor, banzai! Mother, is it you who gave birth to me? No, your mother died here. Exactly 28 years ago. Here? What is it here? It used to be a navy plant. There used to be a huge ammunition plant here. Please tell me about my mother. About my mother! That morning, it was also a sunny summer day. We had been working for a week non-stop, night and day. We were so tired that we couldn't stand upright. But we thought we could continue working. The air strike alarm started at 9:50 AM. But we were so used to having the enemy's planes flying over our heads. They started dropping bombs, as they would always do. When the military orders arrived, it was already too late. As we were running away, the sky turned black. It was because of the enemy planes. It wasn't just two or three of them. "Mizue!! Quickly!" I shouted while running away. We ran to the shelter at the school. The attack was so intense, everything around us turned into ruins. The shelter next to us was completely leveled, Fifteen people died. There was only a hole left. That destroyed our administration. But the bombing didn't stop. We didn't have time to say a single word, we just kept running barefoot. We didn't care about life and death anymore. More assaults came. Covering us with earth and sand. We were trying to run to save our lives. But we were so tired that it was making us fall. Bombs were exploding around us every two or three steps. We finally managed to find a place to hide. But we were afraid to be buried alive... Because of the debris flying all around. It was so hard. The bombings went on. We tried to escape again... Finally we found a small shelter. I took her baby in my arms and ran. I tried to find your mother there, but couldn't see her. At that time, I wanted to raise the child. I was only 16 too. But I could only raise this baby until he was able to crawl, and smile at me with his cute face. You're the one who made her come here, aren't you? Why? Why? Have I been dreaming all along? That's right, I made Mom come here. You thought she was your mother, so you loved her. What are you talking about? You're thinking she's the one who gave birth to you! SQ? I don't know how to explain... Tell me! I made her come here for vengeance. Vengeance? I wanted to verify if you were really that child. I can't win against her, can I? I've tricked her and made her come here! I don't understand! Tell me... Why would you do such a thing? Because I hate her! Why? I don't know how to explain... We died when we were only 16! What did we discover from life? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing... never having loved... never having been loved... Everybody died. Killed by the bombs. Only 16-year-old girls. Do you know how your mother turned 17? How she turned 18? She will never know what being 17 is like. They all died. They all died. She's the wrong one! Jin, it's me you should have loved. Jin, I'm the one you love. Because... I'm your mother! Let's go fetch your ex-husband? He drowned himself. Inna. There's nothing you could have done. Nothing... They all killed themselves. Dead people don't come back. There was no way to make him want to go on living. Do you love me? Yeah, very much! You won't forget? I won't. Never? Never. But... once you leave this city, you'll forget me. I won't forget. For sure! Promise me not to forget until death then. I promise. If you don't respect your promise, you'll have to swallow a thousand needles. Jin? Do you believe a person's soul still lives after they die? If someone is nice enough to remember me, I think... that my soul will keep living forever. Don't you think? But... Why? I don't know... I just suddenly had this feeling. So, do you think we can make one more promise? As you go away, can you promise not to turn your head until you're over there? OK. For sure? Yeah. Then... Good bye! Good bye! THE END Synchr. by Bolero2
