Sir, there was a message earlier from the Foreign Minister. - Whose foreign minister? - Ours. I mean yours.

You are perhaps not pleased with me? What makes you think that? Why do you hide henchmen around when I visit you? To protect me from police brutality. It's a baseless accusation. Have a breathed, worldwide pretending. Hokku. Why don't you leave me alone? Nikki, are you angry with me? Why should I be angry with you? Should I be angry because you use every ounce of the claim in town as a reason to bother me? Should I be angry because every time you have a spare hour you bring me for questioning? I spend more time answering your questions as I'm doing running my business. - Nikki, you are angry with me? - Of course I'm angry. You are trying to force me out of business. Hoku. You want me starving to death on my knees? Begging you to marry me? Say that again. It won't work. We'd never be married until you accept me as an equal.

Observe. 100.000 American dollar check signed, Engstrom. Made out to Nikki. That proves a definite link between. Unimportant fact. Mr. Ichihara. This business between Engstron and Nicki's most interesting. You see, a man arising this time. makes out a check for $100,000. Now, that very night. Six people are killed. Are you suggesting Nikki are involved in murder? I was merely stating the facts. Yon wicked feudal warlord holds me captive. I am a princess... ... and a virgin. Me too. The warlord men come to slay thee. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Throw down your weapons. I have you surrounded! I think I've made them angry. Klaus! I'm a princess and a virgin! I'm a princess and a virgin!

Somebody is trying to give this country bad name. He looks familiar somehow. Excuse me. Abe! Abe! Tied right back. The Professor Klaus, kidnap, abducted.

How the gang made with her. Demonstrate, please. Excellent, no tap a evidence again. Out! Crouchback. Observe. Of course. He's the bass player at the Dragon Club. But, sir, if he works for Club and for Nikki, doesn't that prove a point. - Two possibilities. - Yes, sir? Houseboy moonlighting as bass player or bass player daylighting is houseboy. Yes, sir.

Why did you let it go? Be patient, Nigel. Tokyo was not built in one day. In order to solve a crime, brain needs time. Program myself, feed in fats. Like modern computer. A computer isn't supposed to fall in love with the number one suspect. If it does, it's no longer a computer. That is, gentlemen, most urgent situation. The city closed down tight. Men who kidnap Professor Klaus are trapped within city limits. Remember, millions involved. I want Professor Klaus brought here alive. Assign all available units. Back to your command. Attention! - Bring prisoner here. - Sir. Operations. Inspector, Ichihara here. Have you kept Miss Nikki under surveillance? Has she been seen with any male suspects? I want her watch constantly.

So does the Mccannisher spielvarial fabricat of Dinkle's bureau. - I know. - How does CSS become involved? In business competition between two toy firms? Well, this is a pretty sophisticated doll, Inspector. In fact, my government thinks of it as a potential military weapon. Inspector, I'm most anxious that you cooperate with Mr. Link. He has some invaluable information. Such as? You have a public bath here called armsin. Klaus spent several hours with the masseuses inone of the cubicles regularly, twice a week. Amazing how foreign agency has such intimate knowledge of details. Not so amazing. I'm wait till bath. When you interrupted. Of course, you were without your shoes. The Anson house bath is surrounded as you order, Inspector. I'm shoes. Yoko Hara, cubicle seven. Come along, Mr. Link. Perhaps you'd like to study my methods. - Abe. - Sir! I think he brought here at once for interrogation. Interrogation! - Yes, Sir. - That's all. Engstrom. - Engstrom. - Engstrom. - Where's your guard? - Please, I'm down here Mr. Engstrom likes to feel of me. He likes to me flesh, like dough. He calls it making German dumplings. Not German.

Rules of the establishment, must disrobe before entering. I do not make rules. Merely enforce them. Stretch out. - What's this joke? - Not joke. This is Inspector Hoku Ichihara portable lie detector. Invented by humble self. - It?s this legal? - No, but it has 30,000 transistors. Soon you have nothing to hide. Crouchback! I will handle interrogation myself. - Dismissed. - Of course.

That subject will relax. - Are you ready? - Yes, ready. How long have you been sleeping with Jabez Link? That none of your business. - Answer vague. Innovative. - So are your question. Ask about the murder of Yoko Hara. - Do you murder Yoko Hara? - No. Most strange. It was with me when Yokahara was murdered. That machine says she lied. - But, sir... - You don't interrupt. Sir. You've connected yourself. Sir, you're recording your own reaction. She needs work. May I ask you key questions, Sir? Did you know that your muscle man Kozo was here at the Bugs?

Guards! Banzai! Yes? Pictures. Inspector ordered in photolab. Look important. A picture of the murderer. A picture of the murderer? Like a Picasso Cubist painting. Nerve gas froze the image in various planes. It was most interesting. I'm sorry, Abe. But I haven't got the foggy. - You're an art expert? - Of course. That Picasso thing. They have a picture of the man who kidnapped professor Klaus. We could help them identify the photograph. These are the clues, inspector! Must I paint you a picture? Crouchback need photos from Lab. Crouchback need photos from Lab! Excellent, Crouchback. Excellent. I said excellent. Admire man with initiative. Thanks. Crouchback, observe. Tells me nothing. Tells me everything. Once everything.

You are always asking me things like how long have I been sleeping with X? - Who is X? - Hoku, please. Would you forgive me if my involvement is innocent? You understand, if you are involved, I must do duty. I know, you have a job to do. I am happy you understand. - Crouchback! - Sir? Play tape. Hoku, please. Let me tell you in my own words. Play tape. This is Professor Klaus. I'm surrounded by evil. By forces who want to steal my beloved Schatzi. Also I am pursued by vindictive enemy agents who wish to bring me to trial as a war criminal. I referred to the two Israeli agents members of United States dominated unnacod syndicalist international conspiracy who have hounded me for 24 years. The beginning the end for me was a visit from Miss Nikki Kono owner of the Dragon Club. Hoku, Let me tell you. She paid me 100,000 American dollars. The money was from Engstrom to buy the rights to my doll. Nikki Kono was just the agent in a legitimate deal acting for Engstrom. You see? - Schatzi, You mean she's innocent? - Nikki Kono is innocent. Of any involvement. Thank you, Schatzi. Thank you. Thank you. Nikki. Did you hear? Did you hear? He says you're innocent. Will you forgive me? Of course I forgive you. Now I come to the most sinister figure in the case of the airflox. Schatzi! My apologies, inspector. I seem to have taken over your party. Engstrom, the next whimper bow will be your last. You, turn around. Move into the cage. Into the cage. And close the door. Quick. Give me the tape from Schatzi back. Give me the transparencies. I've got them. Thank you. Well, inspector. Perhaps you'd like to study my methods. All of you on your feet. Turn around. You too, Nikki. Hands over your heads. Crouchback, what you done that?

Needs Klaus for trial, the murder of houseboy. Which he committed while staging false kidnapping of self. Crouchback, handcuffs. May I say goodbye to Schatzi? Schatzi, come here. Turn around. You see, Inspector, there will be no trial. Inside my Schatzi there is a charge of a powerful explosive. Hydrocarbon tecrochloride 32. I can trigger the mechanism. I say one word, one key word, 10 seconds later, you'll blow up. Now, if you excuse us. We'll leave quietly. - Come on, Schatzi. - Crouchback! Don't make me say the word blitz. Once I say blitz... Achtung! Achtung! Schatzi. I didn't mean it. Ten, nine eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two... one... It's all over. 24 years of pursuit and nothing to show. No need for sadness, gentlemen.

My time is today. When a woman can make a career. I want that to make it on my own. Your heart belongs to the way it was yesterday. You want me to be the traditional Japanese woman, on my knees, obeying your commands, serving your dinner, following three steps behind you when you walk? Say it again. Serving you, your dinner, obeying your commands, following three steps behind you when you walk. I know you, Hoku, you're back there again. You can't even hear me. Wait for me, Hoku. Maybe one day I'll have everything I ever dreamed of. And maybe the dream will be empty. I'll propose to you. Subtitles: Kilo
