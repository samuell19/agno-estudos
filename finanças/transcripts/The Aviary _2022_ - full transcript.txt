What's in the way of your joy today? - Anyone following us? - No, I don't think so. It looks so small from here. Okay. Come on. Before I change my mind. Come on, let's go. Take me through it again. Well... The Aviary's right here. We made it to here, about ten miles, last night. Gallop is about another 20 miles-ish, but it's not a straight shot. I think if we can do ten miles a day, we're looking at a three-day hike. - You said two days. - Yeah, I know. That was an estimate. But this map has some loose interpretations. - Like, you see this little bunny hill right there? - Mm-hmm. Not so tiny. I mean, we can go over it, around it, but either way... - Great start. - Okay. Let's do it. Would you call Girl Scouts a cult? I mean, they have levels. They have sashes. They have charismatic leaders you'd follow into hell. Miss Skvarch. Boy, that lady could braid hair. And yet here we are. Just saying, it'd be pretty ironic if my first cult saved me from my second one. Can we not with the C-word? - Sorry. - Selling cookies isn't gonna save us. That's not all it is. It's, like... It's all about you becoming one with nature. - Like these. - Mmm. - Would you eat these? - There's no world in which I eat off the ground. Okay, if you were really starving? Let me guess. They're poisonous. They're prairie berries. Silverleaf nightshade. Very dangerous. And cactus water, extremely acidic. And then the sun, it's our compass. Rises in the east, sets in the west, which also means we know north and south. Plus, I earned a math whiz badge in a Miss Fix-It. Mmm. No map lessons though. It's a survey map, okay? It doesn't show us topography. Without our phones, it's the best we've got. Fucking Seth. Mmm. It should be illegal to call this Triple Chocolate if it doesn't even taste like one chocolate. Well, eat your vegetables, you get dessert. Are you Flamin' Hot or original? Cheers to the first day of the rest of our lives. Mmm. Hey, Seth! I'm eating snacks for dinner! And they're probably, like, 10,000 calories, and I'm gonna eat the whole bag! And, hey, Seth, guess what? When I get home, I'm gonna masturbate! - I'm gonna get high as shit! - Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? - I'm celebrating. - Can you do it quieter? No one's gonna report us. No one's gonna report us. Come on. Come on! Let it out. No, I'm... I'm good. What? What? I just feel like he's here with us. Blair, we've got, like, an eight-hour head start. We've been avoiding all the roads. And no offense, but The Aviary's filled with trust fund babies just like you, okay? So if anyone from Skylight were to find us out here, it would be me. Shh. What? - Shh, shh. - What? - Did you hear that? - Hear what? What are you... No! Blair, what are you doing? Stop, stop! - There's a truck. There's a truck. - Stop it. There's no truck. Blair. Just one minute. Just one minute, okay? Oh, my God. It's nothing, Blair. It's okay. I'm gonna rebuild the fire, okay? Remember Delilah? A little. She was lead engineer before me. She taught me my first Skylight seminar. I was obsessed with her. Gosh, she was just so present and confident and inspiring. She was the business head at Skylight. I mean, it was like my five-year plan had taken human form, and then when she took a liking to me, I was hooked. - She was your Jillian. - Yeah. Till she tried to wake me up. Before she left, she said... something was changing at The Aviary. Seth was starting punishments and putting in cameras, and she was really worried. And you know what I did? I reported her. Two weeks later, just before Christmas, she was out. Everyone was forbidden from talking to her. Delilah was my best friend. She just vanished. I got what I wanted. Got her spot as number two. That was Seth's power, using our desires against us. Everything became a barrier or breakthrough or a reward or a punishment. He got us lost in our own minds. Jillian. Jillian. Wake up. Focus on my voice. Repeat after me. Red. Red. Repeat after me. Red. Red. Repeat after me. Red. Red. Repeat after me. - Red. - Red. - Repeat after me. Red. - Red. - Repeat after me. Red. - Red. Repeat after me. How'd you sleep? Fine. You? Fine. Freezing. I'm... I'm sorry about last night. It's okay. I'm scared too. Yeah? You don't seem like it. We all process things in our own ways. You know, my relationship with Seth was... It was different than yours. What do you mean? Well, my relationship with Seth was built on ideas. You fell in love with him. I mean, I couldn't imagine what that was like. Oh, to learn your boyfriend's fucking the whole squad? Yeah. It's awful. There was, uh... There was an emotional piece for you though. You guys were so close. Maybe. I don't know. I did enjoy the intellectual intimacy. Did he ever make a move on you? I didn't think of him that way. That's not what I asked. No. No, he, uh... He cared so much about his celibacy, you know. That would've been a huge red flag. For me. When I confronted him about all the women, he made me do a six-hour BT session, which ended up with me apologizing to him. I felt fucking disgusting, and that was before you told me he was taping the BT sessions. You know, he tried to cut me. He... He what? After Delilah left, he got obsessed with loyalty and devotion, and he got Kate and Emma to perform a cleansing ritual where they starved themselves for a month. That's why they went to the hospital, not because of food poisoning or whatever bullshit. And then he asked if he could cut me. He wanted to carve the symbol for Skylight into my back. But... But you didn't let him. No. But that's the night I knew we had to leave before somebody got killed. Come on. Fuck. I keep peeing on my shoes. Didn't you ever go outside in Malibu? - Squat lower. - Ha, ha. Okay. Tissues, please. Jillian? Jillian? Dependence is a barrier. Blair. Oh, come on, Blair. I was just teasing. - I won't do it again, okay? - It's fine. Whatever. I mean, if we can't laugh about being in a cult... Stop. I didn't join a cult. I didn't either. Well, great. We don't have to talk about it then. - But that's what it was. - I didn't know what it was. I was 26. I was depressed. I couldn't even leave home. I'd just come crawling back. Until I met you. Miss "There's a Better Way." If I just meet Seth, if I just do one session with him, he would show me the light. He would set me free. Do you remember what you told me when I said no? My learned helplessness is holding me back. - I was only trying to help. - Well, you didn't. Okay? You made me ignore my instincts. You manipulated me. I thought Skylight worked. Well, I guess we're both fucking idiots then. - Yeah. - We are. - Oh. - Wow. I forgot what that felt like. - Mmm. - What? Honesty. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, my God. A little help? Blair! You okay? - Can you move it? - Uh... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Here, let's see. What about this? - See if you can move it back. - Okay, okay, okay. Like this. Ready? Just slowly. Do I have to sleep like this? No. You just have to keep it elevated and still for a while so it doesn't get inflamed. Will you relax? You're freaking me out. Can I ask what happened back there? The sun just got in my eyes. You know you can tell me. It's okay. I did something really stupid. What do you mean, stupid? Seth had all our barrier therapy videos, and I wanted to leave. I really wanted to leave. But I couldn't. No one can see mine. So I took his computer. Are you serious? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Blair. Do you know what we can do to him with this? That's what I'm afraid of, okay? It's not just us running away. It's everything. We have to take this to the police. I think we should destroy it. Are you crazy? In case he finds us out here. In case you and I don't make it. I mean, literally, we could free everyone in Skylight from what he has on them. And what if he has backups? It's okay. Because we are gonna make it. And when we do, we are gonna ruin his entire fucking life. Fine. But I still want to delete mine. - Just in case. - Blair, we didn't... They're my secrets, okay? I get to choose what to do with them. Okay. Your call. Okay, fuck. Password. Have you ever met anyone who talks more about himself than Seth? Anything he'd use, I would know. First pet. Minerva. Blue parrot. - Mmm. - Ugh. Capitalize it. Nope. Favorite teacher. Franklin Lemoyne, AP Psych, 12th grade. I mean, it could be anything. Symbols, numbers. Try "Synthesis." Yes! Oh, God. What's Synthesis? It's just one of Seth's stupid projects. No. Dead battery. Of course. Jillian. Wake up. Repeat after me. Blair. No. Try it again. Blair. Blair. Repeat after me. Blair. Repeat after me. Blair. - Blair. - Blair. - Repeat after me. - Repeat after me. - Blair. - Blair. Blair. Repeat after me. Blair. Blair. Very good. You hanging in back there? Yeah. My head hurts. How much longer? To Gallop? Five, six hours. Oh. It'll be dark by then. Well, we'll set up camp and finish tomorrow. Wait, that's... that's, like, four days. - Do we have enough food for four days? - It's, like, three and a half. - Do we? - We'll be fine. Thanks for telling me about the laptop, by the way. I would've said something sooner, but I thought you'd be mad. Why would I be mad? Because it was impulsive. And someone once told me that impulsive decisions create dependence on the people that bail you out. Well, today I celebrate your impulsiveness. Left, left! Left, right, left! I left my wife and my 48 kids and my old gray mare in a turnip patch! What are you talk... what are you doing? I'm being impulsive! Did I do it right? Right, right foot, hay foot. Come on! You're in a band! - Left... - Holy shit. - Is this Gallop? - It can't be. Well, it's something! - I don't understand. - Oh, my God. - Come on. It's civilization. - No, no, no. Wait. Oh, my God. Okay. Hello? Hello. Come on. Is anybody here? Hello! I don't think anyone's home. But maybe there's a... there's a phone or... or something. Yeah, I don't know about that. Maybe we missed something. - What's here? - What? Hello? Whoa. What is this place? Looks like an old mission. "Calvary Hill." Calvary Hill. No. No, no. That can't be right. That can't be right. God. Oh, my God. Fuck! - What? - Fuck. - What is it? - Oh, God. Calvary Hill is here. Gallop is all the way over here. That's 25 miles in the wrong direction. How is that possible? Okay, we got turned around. Maybe... I don't know. - Maybe the sun... - The sun is not wrong, Blair! - It's the sun. - I don't know. You're the navigator. I just... Thanks. Goddamn it! Oh, fuck. Okay. Okay. All right, what are we working with? Three bottles of water, two protein bars and an apple. It's not enough. How long till Gallop? If we hustle, like, two days. Can I have your knife? Okay, so... We have the apple for dinner. Once we cut it, it won't keep. These, split them into three. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. And there we have them. Two meals each. And we go easy on the water. We sip only when necessary. It's not gourmet, but... You would've made one hell of a Girl Scout. Jillian. Jillian. Delilah? I wanna show you something. He's here. Hiya, Songbird. Blair? Blair? Can you hear me? Blair? Don't move. Don't move. It's okay. Just look at me, okay? Can you hear me? Okay, just walk this way, okay? Baby steps. That's good. Easy. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You were just sleepwalking. Okay? Okay. No mistakes today. Gallop is that way, right? Yes. Will you do the honors? If you're up for it. Hey, I used to sleepwalk all the time when I was a kid, especially when I was stressed. I didn't. You're gonna be okay. Just keep us going in a straight line, okay? Come on. Do you ever think about what you wanna do when this is all over? I wanna travel. I wanna see my sisters and my sisters' kids, make up for all the birthdays that I missed after Seth drove us apart. But first I want to find Delilah. She deserves an apology. Have you ever tried to look for her before? I never knew where to start. Then again, I never had Seth's computer, so... - What about you? - What about me? What do you wanna do after we get to Gallop? Hmm. After a shit ton of burgers and therapy? Revenge. Oh. Like a book or a podcast? Or a tell-all? I was thinking something more hands on. You mean, like, hurt him? That seems... - Impulsive? - ...excessive. I wanna scrub his shit from the Earth. - Even the good stuff? - What good stuff? The parts of Skylight that work. - The fuck is that supposed to mean? - It means look around. You wanted independence. Well, you fucking got it. Disagree with his methods, but he set us free, Blair. Or he set me free. It looks like you still have some work to do. - What? What? - Did you hear that? - Hey! It's a phone! - Blair, Seth has our phones. I know, I know. We can hear you! Blair. - It's two on one! - Blair. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What? - What did you see? - I thought... I think we're drifting. I said, I think we're drifting. Can I just see the map? I believe that large star is the sun. Okay, I hear you. I get it. Just... It feels wrong. Well, coming from you, maybe that's the sign we're doing the right thing. Everything seems familiar. Oh, my God. It's the desert. I just wanna be sure, okay? You're obviously distracted. - No, I'm not. I'm fine. - Oh, come on. You freaked out back there, and then you stopped talking to me. - What happened? - I don't have to tell you shit. No, you don't. I just... I'm worried, okay? Did you see something behind that bush? Fine. Wanna play 20 questions? Why do you keep talking like him? - Who? - Seth. That was one time days ago. - Are you okay? - You said he freed you. - You said I had work to do. Verbatim! - I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. Yes, you fucking did. - Blair, I didn't say... If you wanna lie to yourself, fine, but don't lie to me. Oh, my God, Blair. I don't know what you're talking about. - I swear to God. - Not another fucking word. This feels wrong. Do you have the knife? Why? We're two days from Gallop again. I'll do it. I want mine. Why? I don't wanna worry about where they are. What? You think I'm gonna eat them? I don't know what you're gonna do. Blair, it's me, okay? We're in this together. Then admit what you said. Tell me what you saw. A scorpion. Do you want to die out here? We're going to die out here. We both tracked the sun. We went west. Yeah. So how the fuck are we back at Calvary from the east? We weren't lost. Someone is fucking with us. Oh, what? Did they move the sky and the Earth? You explain it. I can't. Okay, I'm exhausted. Can we just figure it out in the morning, okay? Until then, can we agree that I'm not the enemy? Good night, Blair. No. Jillian. What the fuck? Jillian? Jillian? Repeat after me. Blair. Repeat after me. Blair. Repeat after me. Blair. Jillian? Hiya, Songbird. I don't want to leave you here, but I will, unless you start answering some questions. What does Seth want? - How would I know? - You've been talking to him this whole time. I haven't talked to him since we left. - What does he want? - Blair, please. Did he offer you a better position? - More money? - You're being paranoid. Am I? Because I found your phone. You think if I had a phone, I wouldn't have tried calling for help already? - What are you doing? - You tell me. Blair, what... what the fuck? It was here last night. It was... It was... - Blair. - It was... Blair, where is the map? And the food! Everything's gone! Where's your bag? Where's your bag? Maybe it's in your bag. It was here last night. Here, here. That's my... That's my handwriting. I... I didn't write that. I didn't write that. I didn't write that. I didn't write that. I didn't write that. - I didn't write that. - Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Shh. It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe, okay? Just take a breath. Okay, breathe. Breathe. Okay. - Okay. Okay. - You okay? Okay. Okay. It has to be Seth. He doesn't know where we are, Blair. What if he does? I mean, you... you said it yourself. He got us lost in our minds. What if... What if he's in there with us? I mean think about it. Everything we're doing... Standing outside in the cold, rationing food, doing laps... they're all punishments. They're all Seth's punishments. It could just be coincidence. If I didn't do this, and you didn't do this... I didn't. Then who else? How? I don't know. I don't know. Would you put it past him? Okay. If he somehow did this... what do we do about it? - Abso-fucking-lutely not. - Hear me out. This is a life sentence on a hard drive. Exactly why we have to leave it behind. But he won't know what we do with it. He doesn't need to. We need to. Whatever is happening, it's a subconscious routine, right? Instinct. But it only works because... because we still give a shit. So let's stop. Let's give it up. Let's leave Seth and all his bullshit in the desert where it belongs. Then maybe we have a shot. What about Delilah? We'll find her. I promise. You really think this is gonna work? It has to. How long has it been? A couple hours. Mmm. I don't feel any different. Me either. I mean, I feel dizzy, but that's just the dehydration. Each step, each drop of sweat accelerates the process. So if we circle back or go in the wrong direction... - Right. - And if we're actually going west, and we are going west, we should know if we broke the loop by sundown. How? Valentine Rock. It's the only landmark on the map between Calvary and Gallop. A little less than halfway. Which means we still have a few hours. To what? To hope. Come on. Can we, um... Can we take a minute? We can't stop till we get to the rock, okay? But we don't even know if there is a rock. Yeah, but, I mean, everything looks different, right? At least we're out of the wash. Uh-huh. What? What happened? - Did you sprain it again? Okay, okay, okay. - I don't know! - Oh, God, it hurts. - Let me just... I'm just gonna have a look, okay? - Okay, okay. - Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Is it broken? Uh, I-I don't know. I don't know. Maybe... Maybe you're just dehydrated, and it's aggravating it? - Okay, okay. - Okay. - Oh, fuck. Okay. - Okay. You know what? We're just... We're just gonna find a place to stop, okay? - No, no, no. It's okay. - No, it's fine, okay? - No, we can continue. It's... - No, it's fine, okay? Okay. Yeah, okay. - Okay, watch your head. - Okay. There we go. Okay. Oh, my God. You gonna be okay on your own for a little bit? You really want to find that rock. It's just... I have to. We should be right on top of it now. How far? Just... Just on top of that ridge. I'll have a quick look, and I'll be right back. Okay. Go. I'll start a fire. Just please come back before it gets dark. - Yeah. - Please. I will. I don't wanna be alone. Okay. Okay. Left, left, left, right, left. Left my wife and an old gray mare, 48 kids in a turnip patch. Come on. Left, left, left, right, left. A something horse, a something mare, left it there with a hungry bear. My feet are marching one by one. I don't know this fucking song. Fuck! God! Oh, my God. No. No. Hey, I'm gonna keep going, okay? Just... Just a little bit! No! Get off! No! No. Oh, God. Oh, God. No! No! Blair! Oh, my God. What's wrong? What happened? - I found the last protein bar. - What? - Seth put it back. - What are you talking about? He did something to it. He did... Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, those are prairie berries. - What? - How many did you eat? - I don't know. It hurts. Of course it hurts. It's killing you. Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. - We gotta get it out, okay? - Mm-mmm. Yeah, we gotta get it out before you go into shock. So, please, open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. It's okay. Open. Open. Okay. Okay. Okay. So much for the stupid fucking laptop. Hey, we got out of Calvary, right? We broke the loop. We're headed in the right direction. And I ate a protein bar. Uh... Did you find that rock? Yeah. Yeah. Just, um... Just have to make it to the morning. Yeah, I'm... I'm-I'm on it. - No, hey. - Mmm. You gotta keep your eyes open, okay? Keep watch. Nothing else happens. Okay. Okay, but, uh, you go first. And you wake me up when it's my turn, okay? Hey, can I ask you something? Hmm? What did you see behind that bush? I don't want to talk about it. Was it me? Jillian? Jillian? Oh, God. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Jillian! Jesus. Jillian? Jillian! Hiya, Songbird. Jillian, wake up. Don't be scared now. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Mmm. You did the right thing back in Calvary. I appreciate you looking out for me. But you know she couldn't leave the laptop. She... She did. She did. I promise. You can... - She's gonna turn it on. - Please don't. And when she does, she'll see who you really are. And then she'll know. No. No! Blair! Blair! Blair! - Nuh-uh. No! - Blair, wait! - Stay away from me! - I'm so sorry. - You liar! - Please let me explain, okay? - No! Don't! - Please! I should've told you about the laptop, okay? - You should've left it there. - It wouldn't have made a difference. - You don't know that! - Yes, I do. - I know Seth better than you. - Yeah, no shit. I saw the scar from the cut you didn't get. I should've never left. I had everything I wanted. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. I am needy and reckless, and look where it got me! It's my fault, okay? I am the reason you can't get away. Huh? After Delilah, Seth was crushed. He felt like barrier therapy took too long. So he thought that maybe if he had been faster or more effective, that she would've stayed. So he introduced a new program, and he called it Synthesis. And he asked if I would do the honors of being his first recruit, and I said yes without even thinking, you know? I-I-I was his lead engineer, and I wanted to be as close to him as possible. And that's when he told me he had to cut me to prove my dedication to him. So that's not why you left? No. That came later. These sessions, he dosed me up, and sometimes he would wear a mask, and sometimes I would wear a mask. He would have me repeat words and phrases back to him for hours, and then one day we were done, and he asked for you. And you told him to fuck off. I should've. I-I... Instead I used his words, and I told you that Synthesis would bring you closer, and you were so eager. No, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't. You didn't. What are you talking about? I did, okay? Blair, whatever he did to you... You can't erase someone's memory, Jillian. - You just can't do that. - Yes. Yes, you can, and he did. Blair, he did. And you were right. He put himself in here. Everything that we're doing, everything that is happening to us, it's all Seth or some version of him that's just growing inside of us as we get weaker. You have the scar too. It's right there between your shoulder blades. I should know, because I put it there. Show me. Come on. - I'm so sorry. - Show me! Show me! No way, no way, no way, no way. Oh, my God. - I wanted to tell you. - Don't you fucking touch me! Blair, listen. I brought you into Skylight. I had to get you out. But I didn't want to tell you because I was worried you wouldn't come with me. No shit! You can either go back or you can come with me and truly be free for the first time in your life. I can't, with him in my fucking head. Yes, you can. Okay, if we get out of the desert, and if we fill ourselves back up with food and sleep and love and joy and all of that, we will drown that fucker out. Okay? How'd you find me? You're the only one-legged animal leaving tracks in the desert. Can we talk? What's wrong? - It's him. It's him. - Okay. Oh, God. Hey, uh, you never told me about your band. Oh. What did you... What did you guys play? Loud. I like loud. Were they covers or originals... Jillian. You're letting your guilt guide you. That's not what a leader does. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Hey. Hey. Hey, you okay? - Motherfucker. - Oh, God. What's your plan here? Tell me what you want. Because if it's freedom, real freedom, I gotta tell you, you're walking the wrong direction. What? Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay, just keep... just keep going. - Yeah. - Just keep going. - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Look! - What? - Oh, my God. - Yes, yes. Look! Blair, Blair. Hello? We need help! Hello! Anybody home? Help, please! Hello? Hello? Anybody home? - Hello? - We need help! Hello! Help, please! Help. What if it's Seth? I think we're fine. Oh, my God. That's so... This is so good. Water. Food? Yeah, hotdogs. Just give me, like, 30 minutes. Just 30 minutes. Okay. But just 30 minutes. Yeah, only 30... - No! - What? Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I fell asleep. - Oh, my God. Oh. - Jesus. What time is it? I don't know. Like, 5:00 or 6:00. Okay, okay. You clean up. I'll start cooking. Or we could just go. We're gonna need food out there, okay? We'll leave when we're ready. Okay. - Jesus. - Okay. Just shout if you need me, okay? Delilah Peterson, Lead Engineer. This is our 458th barrier session. Wow. December 20th. What's in the way of your joy today? The secrets. - Keeping them? - Knowing them. Yours or a friend's? - I thought they were a friend. - I'm sorry to hear that. If you were sorry, Seth, then why did you keep them in the first place? Jillian mentioned you were upset. Cut the shit, Seth. I know she reported me. I don't like that term, you know that. We're family. We talk. Well, I'm glad you feel that way, because I'll have a lot to say to the FBI. I'm sorry, what? Where's that coming from? You swore that I was wrong. You said that the drugs were ceremonial. Breaking people down was just building new paths to healing. - Those things are all true. - But all of those are building to something else. Each act we perform here is leading to something greater. - You know that. - Let me try it this way. What is Synthesis? - A theory. - I read your notes. It's a lot more than that. - My notes are private. - Privacy is a barrier. - Yeah. - I'm facilitating an open and honest dialogue. Who the fuck do you think you are? I am your partner of 20 years. We started all of this in my living room. - We wanted to help people. - Yeah. You've changed. Synthesis will be extraordinary. I'm telling you, I need time. I need time. I'll prove it to you. I'm done. You're leaving me? I'm not leaving. This is my home. - Good. Yes, we'll fix this. - I'm gonna fix this. I'm Seth. You know me. I'm not a bad guy. You're not Seth. You're the devil. - Where are you going? - To get Blair. - You can't be alone. - I don't need Blair. Can I have your help, please? Thank you, Blair. Delilah? Don't touch me. Take her. Oops. My favorite. Blair Gonzalez. December 21st. This is our 132nd barrier session. Oh, come here. What's in the way of your joy today? Blair? - Sorry, I... - No, don't be sorry. What's in the way of your joy? I can't right now. That's the best time to break through your barriers, when it feels insurmountable. Tell me, what's going on in your head? Um... - Delilah. - What about her? She... She yelled. She yelled? What did she yell? "Move, cunt." I'm sorry. That's inexcusable. I'll talk to her. She's just such a liar. She was gonna tell people all kinds of things. - Someone had to stand up, you know? - Mmm. I mean, the world needs you. I need you so much. I need you. And she... she was gonna take you away. No, no. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. I know. I stopped her. What do you mean you stopped her? I hit her. Again and again. And again. Until she stopped. I did it for you. I did it for you. That's not... That's not how I wanted you to find out. I was gonna tell you. I just, uh... I didn't know how. I thought you'd be so afraid, you were just gonna leave me out in the desert. You're right. I would've. I know, and I deserve it. If it were true. If? You know what Seth was capable of. - Yeah, but I was there. - No, no. He made you believe you were there. I took Delilah back to her room. I asked her to stay, and when she didn't, I... No, no. No, you are not... you're not a murderer. - I am. - No! Stop saying that, okay? Just listen to me. It is Seth. It is fucking Synthesis, so just say it! - I can't. - Say it so I don't hate you! I can't. I've let people bail me out my whole life. I'm not bailing you out. I'm just trying to keep you tethered to reality. - Whose? - Ours. Then stop playing by his rules. There's no barriers to break through. - There's no hidden truth. - Goddamn it, Blair, stop! All Seth did was teach us how to see the world through him. He didn't free us from our cages. He gave us tools to build prettier ones. I killed Delilah. No. And I have to live with it. It can't be about him anymore. It has to be about us. Or we'll never get out. - If you can't see that by now... - Move! She has a point, you know? - You do make everything about me. - Blair! It's okay. I'm not here to cause trouble. I... You girls do your thing. I just want to state my case. Okay? It's all right here. You knew Delilah was gonna talk, and you couldn't have that happen, could you? So you killed her. I promise you, I didn't. Yeah, you killed her and you put it on Blair. - You let that poor girl live with it. - No, that's not what happened. I fucked up. That's what happened, okay? Things got out of control. And if I need to be punished for that, so be it. We'll call the police. But before you do, I think you should know it's not gonna help. You've been through so much. What are you talking about? - Let's not do this here. Let's go. - No. Let's. I know Delilah came to see you before she came to see me, and she told you her plan, what she would do when she left, who she would tell, what she would testify to. Yeah. I reported her. I know you did. Jillian, you waited for her after her session in her room in the dark. I know you didn't mean to hurt her. I know. You're so full of shit. Look at the video. I know what I saw, okay? I know what I saw. - What did you see? - Stop it. Stop. Just stop. Stop. What did you see? What did you see? - Stop. - What did you see? - Get out of my head. - What did you see? Stop fucking with my head! I should've told you earlier. You were... You were devastated by what you had done, and I didn't want you to live with it. And so I-I rushed Synthesis. It would've taken years with BT to try to help you. I mean, barrier therapy means nothing. It's-It's cavemen grunting around a fire. It's nothing compared to Synthesis. And I rushed it. I rushed it for you. If you come back... If you even want to come back, I promise you, we will figure out what went wrong, and we will fix it. I wanna do this work with you. I wanna bring Synthesis to the world... with you. It was always you, Jillian. It was always you. I fucked up. It all just got a little out of control. Blair? Blair! Blair! Blair, I got him! Blair? Blair? Blair? No. No. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Jillian. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come here. You're okay? Are you all right? Okay. We were worried sick about you. You feel okay? You have my bag? Yep. Got your bag right here. - Got your computer back. - Aw, that doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you're okay. What about Blair? Is she still mad? She's gone. Where'd she go? She left. She did? Yeah. Skylight isn't for everyone. You know that. That's too bad. I really liked her. Yeah. Yeah, me too. You get in. And relax. What about you? Give me two minutes. Turn on the heat. My hands are cold. Here. I'll warm them up. How's that? How'd you find me? You never left. What is Skylight? It's life-changing. What is Skylight? I don't like the term "self-help." Self-help looks inward. That's where we start, but big picture, Skylight looks out. Through barrier therapy, or BT as we call it, we push past our limits and obliterate the boundaries between who we are and who we want to be. Which is why I couldn't be more excited to be opening The Aviary, our new campus in the heart of the Southwest. Full immersion. Most people spend their lives looking at the world from inside a cage. It's a cage they build. It's a cage they imprison themselves in. Here at The Aviary, we're gonna deconstruct those cages one bar at a time. So, no, I don't... I don't control anybody. I just want to help people fly.
