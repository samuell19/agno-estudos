St. Andrew's Colours Film Company in association with Anna Kapaleva Olga Yakovleva Sofiko Chiaureli Sos Sarkisian in a film by Maria Saakyan Strange birds in the new-found grey sky. Strange faces on the strange city's body. Grey, pearl ashes and dust. Sad is the funeral repast. Strange birds in the new-found grey sky... The birds took wing, but couldn't alight, just circling in the sky. Walking... I'm walking along, where the birds are, where the birds are... The Lighthouse A strange land is so vague You get confused and lost You feel so creepy At the thought of what may happen Say, there's a gulf you have to clear Will you freak out or jump without fear? So much for that, pal That's the whole deal... Good and evil in Wonderland... - Good heavens, Aunt Kasiana! - Lena! My baby! Let me help you. No, thanks, Mum. OK. What are you doing here? I'm Sophia Perperidi, a singer. And who are you? I'm Marquisa, my father's daughter. And this is my home. - Hello. - Hello, Lena. Granny! Granny... The war has been going on for two years. You never called. When Dad died, I was in shock. I couldn't cry, couldn't sleep. I was scared. Don't talk like that. You think I'm not scared? They're blocking Armenian communications, carrying out anti-terrorist operations, checking papers, arresting and deporting Armenians. There's a severe lack of food. The situation in Armenian populated areas is critical. The only means of transportation is aircraft. Armenian civil aviation has Ans-2, Mis-8 and Yaks-40. At least one An-2 was brought down by Azeri ack-ack guns, reports say... In the west of the country, government troops are on the offensive pressing Georgian ex-president Gamsakhurdia's supporters. The Georgian town of Senaki is being attacked from the Martvili region. Government troops hold advantageous positions near the port city of Poti. Observers are attributing the success of the government troops to the efficient actions of the paramilitary units of Dzhaba Ioseliani. Rosa really wants to go and visit her son in the army. He's been serving for a year now. But she keeps receiving the letters... "Mum, I am no longer here, I've been transferred." Poor Rosa. She just doesn't know what to do. There you are... It's been seven years since the glorious anniversary. Very different people play in the quartet now. All of them are young and promising musicians. I'm coming. Just the finishing touches. Coming, coming. Bye, neighbours. Leaving already. You say goodbye every week. You're a good girl, Lena. My son sends word regularly. They've been transferred to the border unit. - Did you turn off the iron? - I did. My! I left the striped blanket behind. Lena... Wait, OK? What a man! Nagging his own child! Elbows up. That's it. Fingers... It's very important. Give it more force. Once more. What's so funny? Are you a man or not? He learnt nothing from his granny. Hold it. If you play well, I'll buy you a black piano. Mind your fingers. Are you a man or what? I'll give you an organ. Don't show me up in front of people. Wait! Where are you going? O great Madonna, take me with you. Rosalinda, queen of mattresses and mirrors, turn left, see there are aurochs around here! Hey, queen! Do you know how strong I am? Don't stand there, come give me a hand. If you're so strong, stack it all. I can take them wherever you say, with or without the truck. Good mattresses, nice mattresses. - Where are you going? - I'm going with you. - I'm the great Maradonna. - Hey, he's getting off here. Lena, tell him... stop the car. One bunch of parsley, one bunch of coriander and one bunch of dill. Fish again. Here it is... She's here, I'm there. She's there, I'm here. Here I am. And this is my wife Rosalinda. I'll get the tickets. When's the next train to Moscow? - To where? - Please come closer. Look at the flowers I brought you. My love, I'm all yours this spring. These flowers are for you. Mummy, don't you recognise me? Get out of here. My love... I'll call the police. It's all in the schedule. Crazy woman! Ophelia indeed. - Don't be mad at me. - Hey, who are you? Who are you? The doctor says you shouldn't worry, Mother. - Mother? Get out! - Mother, love me. Leave! I can't take it any more. The doctor says not to worry. I wish you were born a fish. Stay away from me. - Where is the station master? - I am the station master. Could you come closer? How many times do I have to say, it's all in the schedule. - A fish bit her. - Nobody bit me. - Get out. I'll show you some fish! - The station master can't do anything. There are no trains. I've told you four times: there are no trains. No trains! No trains! Come, Rosa. Yeah, Lena. Get lost! NO TRAIN Really? Lie down, Kasiana, Lie down. Get out of here. Lie down. It's OK. Of course it's OK. Yes, I'll lie down. Everything's fine. Quiet... Grandad! Thank God you're alive, baby. Why didn't you leave? Don't you see what's going on here? We are old, they'll leave us alone. Don't worry. Go please. We'll be upset if you stay. Go. Granny and I are begging you. For Christ's sake! There's enough for all. Come on. Don't you see me? They're all nuts. Hey, give it back! Are you nuts? Good God, they've gone out of their minds. Please, don?t jump the queue! Step aside! Where was the shooting today? Am I the worst enemy? Lena, what's with you? What's up? Let's sit down. I saw him with hamster-looking woman again. She's making it up. Don't listen to her. - I saw them! - Blabbermouth! - Look at him. - Men are the world rulers. - Do you rule the world? - I'm the world dictator. Oh yeah? I talk when I wish and I don't talk when I wish. - Ah women... - Better not to talk. - Yes, Lena? - This is my wife. This programme is devoted to a folk instrument... - Hi. - Hi, Lena. Let me help you. Kasiana... - What are you doing? - I'm breaking them. I know, but why? It's going to be hot. She's out of her mind again. Kasiana! Lena, I'm scared. I want to break all the windows. But why? If I break one, burglars won't believe I've got nothing. But if I break all the windows it will be cold. I'm afraid of burglars. Last night the radio said burglaries are on the rise. If all the windows are broken they'll think there's no one in. OK? Yes, but why? What shall I do? What shall I do? The attacking forces used civilian planes to drop hand grenades onto the village. - What lie did I tell now? - This is my brother Gocha. How we fought! Hey, Levan, you used to have such a head of hair when you were young. And now look at you. I was two then. I want to tell a story. - Not about that hamster woman? - Last summer... No, it was winter. Levan, is that you? Where? Let me see. Wasn't I cute? Tell him to kill that woman. Levan, kill her. Sure. No problem. Hey, hamster-woman, where are you? Come out! There she is. - Is it her? - Yes. Hamster-woman, a cute girl here wants you to go to the other world a little bit. Just a little bit. Aren't you ashamed? You've got a beautiful young wife and you get yourself a mistress! Look, don't take offence. All men are that way, trust me. At least somebody stands by me. Hold on, you... No female solidarity. Female solidarity? What is that? We can't even be friends. And you say "solidarity". What would you do? - I've already done it. - What? I banged him... ...on the head with a saucepan. So that all tubs flew away and kicked him out. What would you do, Lena? Where is she going? I always forget where the... ...safety catch is. - Give it to me. - She's here. Wow. A mist is mysterious. A mystery's misty, misty... Great. You are of some use now. Not like before... Maradonna... Roots, bows... It's not that simple. I had a dream as a girl that I was a tree. It was scary because I couldn't move. Then I realised I shouldn't move because inside of me there's the whole world. Land, water, sun, bubbles of air... Crazy dreams you had, Aunt Kasiana. I was big and plump like a pregnant woman. I was a pear. What can you do, Maradonna? Nothing. Flying toward me like my birds... Don't. You'll get dizzy. You're just like a child. Follow me. Come here. The helicopters were deployed to neutralise the militants' strengths. Their casualties are unknown but in Noragukh one woman was killed and seven wounded. How did you know you were pregnant? Well, you see... Wave your hand. I liked milk. Then, you know... like... I couldn't drink it, this milk. Such a disgusting smell! - Till I gave birth... - And Levan? He was happy. Why? Just asking. Why are you making that hooting noise? Are you a boat? What? There you go. Where are you going? - I'll catch you. - No, you won't. Come on, come on... That's it. - Ghivi... - What? Look, there's a nest. Birds... ...feather... There's something in there. Lena! - Lena. - Mother! Baby, why are you sad? I think you should leave. Leave and go where? It's impossible to live here. How can we live here, Soso? So it's impossible to live here. When will they have kerosene? Nobody knows. Didn't you know what was going on here? Why did you come? This train doesn't stop here! Step back, damn you! Arthur! Our neighbour la is dead. I've known la since we were young. She asked me to play at her funeral. - Don't lie. - Don't yell. We don't want your music. Go away. It's the last wish of the deceased. Is it her last wish or did she ask you years ago? We don't want your music at her funeral or at mine. - You play at your own funeral. - I won't play at yours. - Damned Paganini. - Paganini played the accordion. - He'll learn... - Yokel. My baby... daughter... It's you who should have mourned me, not me mourn you. Ia, my daughter... Why, O Lord? Where is the stone that would break my hapless head? My girl, my baby... Look, a dead body over there! Ghivi, go and play. Have some respect. Have some respect, I said. We weren't really watching... Let's go see the mist. My condolences. Please, Kasiana. She worked so as not to think... She had cancer. Don't cry. Now I believe in the afterlife, now I don't. - I scored a goal again. - Smart arse. I wonder if cows know they'll die. If they don't, why are they afraid to go to the edge of the ravine? I don't understand. What did they write? Missing... It means he's alive, right? He just... They'll find him, right? Why are you staring at me? They will find him. I just don't know where I should go. Well... I... This is... Yes? Don't pity me. Don't pity me. I'm his mother. I know he'll be back, they'll find him. Don't pity me, don't. Rosa! Lena, my daughter la is over there. Call her. My daughter is over there. Let me take you home. My daughter is over there. She is over there. Izo! We'll stay with our relations. Settle as best we can. Moscow is something... It's better than what we have now. So don't worry. We'll send this one to kindergarten. I'll fix it. You know me. I can do it. It can be fixed. Right. I guess there'll be no train. The bastards lied. Why would they lie? They make money on it. It's pitch dark. How do we get back home? What shall we do? - Go to the railway station? - It'll come, don't worry. Are you OK, buddy? Let's launch it. Here's a star. See the little star in the sky? Did you see it? Fly it. Where's the snail? Here it is crawling. - Finished? - Not yet. Ghivi, stay here. Hey, Lena... Handle it with care. Move it, Levan... Come on... I begged Father to buy me a piano. He sold two cows but it wasn't enough. I got it later. He was a great person, may he rest in peace. Piano... It's... it's fantastic. You know the main thing in music... Careful. It's not a cow. It's an instrument...
