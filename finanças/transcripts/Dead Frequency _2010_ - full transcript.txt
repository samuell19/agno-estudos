I can hear the damn pigeons.They are in the loft now. I can Hear them, I can. E been feeding them haven't you Pam? You know you only have yourself to blame. Everyone thinks this is funny. But what should I do with them? We have an email here from Mark in Birtley. Apparently they go well on toast. See what I mean Sam? So what else is going on in London tonight? I'm surprised we are getting all these pigeon calls. Well people are for them or against them. There is passion here Sam. We are Londoners. Well we are certainly hearing a lot about them tonight. How did you come across us? How did you find us? I thought you would never ask! Now you don't want me saying what we have in common on air do you? No one would believe me anyway. I see. Well Pam that will be our little secret. Thanks for calling. We will have to leave it there as we are now coming up to the two-am news. After the news we have Geoff Stuart to see you through to five-am. I'll be back tonight at eleven. Take care, see you then. - Hi. - Hiya. - How was the show? - Good, good. Any problems?

You ought to try walking the streets round here through the day. What are you a man or a mouse? Squeak. Y it's not that it's stressful. It's just those staff just give me such grief. There is something not right with those kids. Kids exactly! You are getting stressed over a bunch of kids! It's not that it's just... They know who's boss.They know I lead, it's just... Something's not right. I just can't put my finger on it. You don't let me get away with anything round here so how the bloody hell can you let a bunch of kids get the best of you? You don't understand. And that Emily. What a bitch! What do you mean a bitch? How can you not control them? The way you go on at me it's a miracle you let them get away with anything. Its not that. They know who the boss is. They know I'm a manager. They know I lead. It's just something is not right with them. I will get to the bottom of it. I really will. Ok at the way you are going on. I can't believe you. Getting stressed over a couple of kids. You don't understand. Honestly. It's just weird. Cheeky little bastards that they are! Afternoon boss. Alright Billy.

I hate getting away this late. It's the sun. Gives us headaches. Same here. Don't worry. I won't be arsed. Oh you're so strong Sam! She's a stuck up cow anyway. Let her come in to meet shit. I'm with you. I'm owed time and if I'm not I probably should be. You're joking! Sam she'll do her nut. You already missed her first poxy meeting on Wednesday. She did say there are going to be some changes so we are either for her or against her. Nothing important then. Anyway I'm going to go or this will start to seem like work. You twats! I'm stuck covering the desk until Tom 'till six-am. Emily's been off for a long time. Oh yeah! Give me strength. Just be your usual charming self Wayne. Come in with me Sam. It's not a good idea. I'll see you later. You can't keep denying you love me Sam. I won't let you. Look I don't want to hurt you and I'm good at doing that to people. Look I know you're divorced. But I know how you really feel. Sam you don't fool me. I'm not trying to fool you. I would be no good for you. Let me decide on that. Come in with me Sam please. Look don't do this Emily. I can't. Who do they think they are! No one messes with me. Sodding bloody Newcastle Talk Radio Station. Bloody bunch of arseholes. Bloody sick of that bloody place. Bloody pig sick of the bunch of cheeky bastards. No one messes with me. Stupid twatting birds! Shit and bird seed all over the bloody place. All these bloody weeds everywhere. I can't bloody get rid of them all. I'm sick and tired of this. I don't believe it! Just tell us if they give you any more shit babe. Nobody, but nobody messes with my woman. Leave them to me. You're just a debt collector. I'm a manager and I lead. Now just you remember that. Now take that twit Billy with you and go and collect some debts. After all how else is a woman supposed to live. Are where exactly are those two? Don't tell me they are not here? I take it you told them like I said? Yeah they send their love. Do you think you're funny. Now let me explain. That was a rhetorical question so don't try and answer me back. Now you may be thick, so let me explain this slowly for you little boy. I run this place! Not you, not him and not his floozy. Emily and Sam you mean? Who else? Make it my business to find out what deviance is going on around here and then I rout it out. Okay, okay. Oh sorry I didn't realise you were mentally retarded. Helps to work here. Work! You don't have a girl do you? Well you won't be getting one either, because who would want some soon to be out of work looser like you? I take that's formal notice of end of our contract is it? Just tell them I will be in later tonight because what I have to say will make it so worth while. Bye then. Just whose diseased prick did you dribble off the end of? Do you know someone has left another paper cup over there? I keep telling them about that. No one gets away with showing disrespect to me No one! Just who the fuck so you think you are? Mr Clarkson? - Sir? - What is your report? It's in hand Sir. In hand? What do you mean it's in hand? It's just that they don't scare easily. Look I can't make it much clearer. I didn't send you in there for your pretty face. I'm sick of this undercover crap. All we do is chase shadows. I bet they are not anyway. Use your personality disorder and that misfit boyfriend you picked up and push them to expose their secret. What about my safety if they are? Well I take it you're prepared? Oh Yes. Then if our suspicions are confirmed you know what to do. Sergeant Handyside? Yeah look she is stressed and under pressure. Let's increase surveillance. I want to really know what is going on in there. This will swipe the smirk off their face. Roger. It's me. Forget what I said earlier. I've got a job for you. Take down this address. Another day shift again. I much prefer nights. I know we have adapted to the day but I would rather work a night anytime. Ah look Kevin stop whinging will you? Look we've all got to go to work you know. Day or night shift. We are going out tomorrow. I can't wait. Well you could look forward to it. I mean I've been planning for ages and I've spent a lot of money. Whatever. I'm off to work. I love you. See you then. Haway then. What's the matter? Looks as if you have been crying. I'm alright it's nothing. Well clearly there is something. So what's the matter then? Nothing I'm fine. Bollocks. Look it's just Kevin. You are not happy are you? No not really it's what I thought it was going to be to be honest. Doing wrong? What's the matter? - Oh what is he doing right? I thought things were happy anyway? Well so did I. But? I don't know. I've just got other things going on in my mind. And he hasn't even done anything wrong it's me being just... What? Awful to him all the time. And he's trying his best and everything he does just irritates more and more. You don't want to be with him do you? I'm not being funny but I've noticed it myself. Ou're not happy. If you are not happy you are going to have to. You are just going to have to tell him. Because it's not fair on you and to be honest with you it's not fair on him either. He's trying his best as well but he must know there's something wrong. Like when he left just then before you came he didn't even like call in to the kitchen to say goodbye or give us a kiss or anything. But then that's my fault because I'm not really encouraging him to come and kiss us and cuddle us. He probably thinks I'll bite is head off or something but... But why? What are you being nasty to him for then is it just.. I don't know I feel like a bit ... Can I be honest with you? It might be kinda a bit of a long shot. But I think you still have feelings for Sam. It's just the way you are with him. I personally I can see it. E you are not happy with Kevin. I know you are not happy with Kevin. I'm not happy with Kevin but I mean... Do you still like Sam though? Say anything. Honestly it will not go no further or anything like that. I know that might sound terrible but honestly just the way you are around each other. And you have got such a nasty aggression towards Emily. Kevin was a perfect option for us then and he's exactly like that now. So it seems strange that I want to go back to something that I wanted to leave. Probably 'cause you just wanted a change and now you have had that change. I'll be honest with you it's not for the better like. It's just tink he is a bit of a bore. Tries to... he resites poems. - Sorry I know that sound horrible but... Which I know some people find lovely. But you know me, I'm not that type of lovey-dovey person... Don't you think he is boring? Haway! He's not boring, he's stable. Describe him as a stable person. - Stable? He's a lunatic. But he would make someone a lovely husband. But just not me. Bastards! You stupid person don't you know which way - you are going! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll get you! I'll get you! Bitch! It's really nice. A nice view. Ah it's beautiful. A beautiful city. The bridge looks good from here. I've never been here before. Well I said I was going to give you an experience today. It's a nice spoon. Is that an ashtray? No. They are baking tins. Alright I thought it looked like an ashtray. Is that used? No it's for you when your going round. Alright. Who uses video? Oh loads of people. That's another twenty pounds! Hiya. Can I get some beef liver please? Yes certainly how much would you like? Just a pound. One-seventeen please. Well shall we go to the Baltic next? Yeah, if you want. Do you want to go for some drinks or something? I'm so glad. Really I put a lot of expense and thought into it. Yes it was really nice Kevin. It's been a lovely day for it. Nice weather. Are you okay? You seem not with me. Kevin I'm fine. I'm just tired that's all. I've been really busy at work and you just keep asking us questions and trying too hard. We are all busy at work though. I know I am busy. Yeah well right. You know, lets just enjoy today. And just stop asking us so many questions. Let's just leave it. I just don't think that you are totally with me today. I just think your mind's in a different place. I think you are thinking about something else. Or maybe even somebody else. Well what is that supposed to mean? Nothing forget I ever said it. - No come on come on what's that supposed to mean? Nothing, it doesn't matter. Kevin you can't say something like that and not expect me to ask what you're talking about. Well no come on Kevin! No I didn't mean it. Kevin you can't say something like that and then expect me just to not ask what you are talking about. You are thinking about him aren't you? About who? You know who. I'm not even going to say his name. Right well Kevin we may as well just cancel the whole day now because I'm not going to walk around all day with you knowing that you think I'm apparently thinking about someone else. It I've got other stuff planned. - Right well put your card on the table. At is the matter? What's wrong? Who am I supposed to be thinking about. I think you are thinking about Sam. What like my ex-husband Sam? There's only one Sam isn't there? Are you, you are not serious? Are you serious Kevin? Very serious. Are you actually serious? Yeah. I'm serious. I've said it. Do you really think I would have gone through all that crap with him getting divorced to get with you and be with you now here today married. If I wanted to be with Sam? Well I just think I'm always trying my best. Well that's it you are always trying and trying and trying. Can you not just live for the moment. And enjoy each other rather than constantly be on me back all the time? Ways feel like I am second best. - You are not second best to anyone Kevin. To him. Kevin look right yes I've got feelings for Sam. Of course I've got feelings for Sam we used to be married for years and you know but it's not like I have got for you. Know it is really good as well. I'm really glad that you are friends. Well good because it is just friendship.That's all. I'm glad I'm glad you're friends. Well I hope you are. I don't want to feel uncomfortable around Sam every time we are together. Well I think of him as one of my best friends anyway. Well if you think like that then I don't understand why you would have these thoughts? He's like a brother to me. Really. I love him. Really. I love him. Sorry. You are. You are allowed to smile. Sam. You know you changed me all those years ago? Well, why did you do it? I was cruel then. I'm so sorry. Are you really sorry? Because we wouldn't be here now. Emily, Emily, I don't... You just need to be able to show your feelings Sam. I know how much it hurts for you to open up your heart. Is where the little twat lives. Let's just get this over with. How can anyone live in a shit hole like this? He needs a slapping for that alone. It's not bleeding natural. Aw bugger off! You just want me to put frighteners on him boss? Can't we give him a good kicking while you are at it? Suits me. You see that is the trouble with women. A thousand words where one would do. They get into these boss jobs. And then need us men to sort out the mess for them. Don't you diss my women either. Sorry boss. Only joking! Yes, me too. So we don't owe him then boss? Oh he owes me alright. Anyone who dissis my woman dissis me. Yeah that is right out of order boss! Right this is his hole. Watch what you are treading in. Wayne eh? It is Yeah. Hello Sonny. Who's been a cheeky boy then? We knows what happens to cheeky boys don't we? To be honest I think you've got the wrong place. Wrong place you little shite! It's the wrong fucking place alright! That's what I thought. Okay? You diss my women and now you're dissing me! What he's your woman? Diane was right. You are a little twerp who needs a big lesson! Are so you're Diane's new bloke. He's doing it again boss. Do you think there's something wrong with him? There's something wrong with him alright. Okay. Next time you pop round yeah? I'll tell you what let us know and I'll put the kettle on for you alright? Aw I told you to bugger off and that wouldn't have happened. Daft old git. I bet it's going to busy again tonight. Fighting, drugs, O.D.'s. It'll be the same usual Friday night. Yeah you said before. It's always getting busier. Something has been odd though. Since that new manager Diane came in. Yeah I want to find out about her. Do you think Sam can keep control there? Well he had better. I don't want Diane finding out anything. Look the pub's just up here I'll just pull in. I'll not be long. Just pull in. Hi. You still making a bit of a habit of this then? Of course. And anyone would think we were still married. So how's Dr Dolittle? Kevin? Well he is worried. Look in a way we are still married. And any problem for you is problem for me and the rest. Problem? There's no problem. What? So you think getting pissed before work is normal? It helps when I think about what I am. What we all are. So why are you here? Look I know you love Emily. Why don't you just admit it? You were strong once. Strong I can't handle it. I don't want the feeling. Not again. It's like a sickness. Your emotions will get us all found out! Look Emily's young and naive just keep her at a distance. And keep off the bottle. You always were melodramatic Jenny. What do you know about Diane? Stuff her! She's no threat. Watch my lips - Diane. Why a new manager so soon? What's her agenda. Are they onto us? I can handle it. We all just ignore her. Are you listening to me? Do I have a choice? So what if they find out? What! It's unthinkable! New jobs, new identities. Owing favours to other cells like us? Shit happens! Me and Kevin don't want to be doing a runner. And neither do you Wayne or Emily. Look just cut the denial and cut the drink now! Just cool it. There's no problem I haven't dealt with before. New managers have come and gone. She's different Sam. Under stress people crack! Why a change in management so soon? Look I'll keep an eye on things. Well lets meet tomorrow. Let's not. Get a grip Sam. Look I'm off. Take care. Same again Bob. And another for the plant. Sorry mate I owe you one. The boss wanted me to meet her new bloke and I was a little held up. You three live in such a dodgy place I'm surprised you are here in one piece never mind late. And Diane's got it in for you. Isn't she cute? For God's sake Emliy I'm going on the sodding air in a minute. I'm trying to run a show love. A fate worse than death Wayne pet. Thanks to Jonathan Miles for the news at one-am. So how's the news affect you? Petrol prices increase but electric cars are as hard to get as ever. Sorry about that folks. Diane our new station manager was attacking me. But I've put her back in her cage. So are you being ripped off or have you found a different way around? Started cycling perhaps? Ring in to have your say. Give us a shag. Stop it Emily this is getting serious. I am serious. John has emailed us. He says the future is in air compression cars. Well they should certainly go with a bang. Well thanks for calling Dave. It's now coming up to two-am. And we will be going across to the news with Johnathan Miles. After that Jess Edwards will be here with you through to five-am. From me goodnight. Now give us a shag. No and that's my last word. You just have to unwrap me. No we've got to be professional.

Look you said you wanted to speak to us. What is it? Well Wayne said that Diane caught you and Emily. How can you do that? Do you know what that does to me? We're divorced remember? I told you to show your feeling Sam. Not just fuck her at work! We didn't plan it. It just happened. It's not Diane's feelings I'm worried out it's us. I'm not going back to a bohemian existence for anyone! I hope you don't mind me joining you two, but I could hear you upstairs. I was just telling Sam how stupid he is! Why do you never listen to anything? I need some fucking sleep! For God's sake! Us mortals got work in the morning. For crying out loud I just wish you could just fucking piss off! Who's that? Does she know about us? That's Ann. That's our lodger. She's very discreet. It's one of is ex-patients. For fuck's sake Jenny! You talk to me about taking risks! We have all just got to keep our heads clear and hopefully this will all blow over. All it takes is one silver bullet. One fire, one mob attack. Yeah we do recover from injuries but there is a limit. That's what I have to tell you. There's a reason why I came here alone. And what's that? Well I didn't want you going for Emily. Stop being cryptic Sam. What are you trying to say? Emily's bitten Diane. E has recovered really quickly. She is one of us now. The stupid bitch! The stupid little bitch. We don't even know if she's one of the hunters. She was with them. She came to speak to me. How can you be talking so calmy about this? Doesn't the prospect of no longer being the sodding undead and being in the dead bother you? Hey! I know you don't I? You're that little slut from the radio station. Where's Wayne? Come on! You go around like a bunch of school kids. Tell us where he is and we might leave you alone. You heard the boss, speak up or get a slapping! What's this? Been shopping have we girlie? Aargh! That's disgusting! What kind of bird are you? Well I've had a bad day and I needed some comfort food. You cheeky little bitch! That does it! Get her guys! Viv get her! Go on! Go on Girlie! Go on! Bitch. You sort her! Go on! Come on get her! What are you waiting for man! It's only a woman! Kill her! Go on you whimp get in! Hello Two this is Sunray. We have a situation. Meet at R.V. seven-hundred-zulu over. (Over radio). Two received, out. Sunray out. How's your woman boss! None of your sodding business! Sorry Billy. S in a strange mood. She's been hanging round the bedroom being all feisty, being odd. I don't know what's up with her. Now if you reflect back on what you've done, would you say you have learned anything? Sorry Sam. Well at least you didn't have a nibble this time! Well Diane was fitter. Yeah, I suppose so. Where are you going? - The station. - You're early. I know I've got to plan for the show. See you later. Want a beer? No thanks boss that's enough for me. Get them sunglasses off and get us something to eat will you? Aw that's foul! I think she is on the stuff too boss! You can cut that crap out right now. Shit! Not again! Not again! Hey it's been a bad day boss. What the frigging hell are they all on! Bloody hell I know red meat can be good for you but that's ridiculous. I don't fancy any of that boss. Me sodding car! H it Sam! They're all the same. - Can you hear that? Country's going to pieces mate. - Me belly! Hanging around in gangs! Drinking and smoking pot. Loutish and indecent behaviour! Simon, I must clarify that he was only arrested for being drunk. And there no evidence that the rest of the Cabinet were involved. But they are supposed to be running the country! No wonder unemployment and house repossessions are so high! They blame the global recession and the bankers. You are probably spot on there. - Filthy druggy wasters! As drunk as skunks! Shoot them all that's I say! - Okay well thanks for your call. Do call again. Not too soon. What a tosser! Does he not know what's like to have a problem? He's the one that should be shot. Fuck him! What are we going to do with that Sam? Have you kept giving her coffee like I said? Well what's wrong with her? She's the best station manager we've ever had! Pissed out of her box twenty-four seven. Suits me. Emily you are going to have to look at the wider picture. I mean think of the reaction peoples going to have when they, you know, find out that we and she are all vampires. I've been trying to find out more about the man who sent her here. And? No joy. She has been too pissed since to make any sense. Look what one of your nibbles has done. You need to keep your fangs to yourself Emily. I felt like I was being followed earlier. Someone would have to be brave to follow you. I will check out with Kevin and Jenny later this morning. And see if they have noticed anything. When she is sober enough take her home to annoy Roger. That was a busy night shift. That hospital gets busier by the day. Stop it Kevin! What's the matter with you? Well you know. It's that time of the month when we... you know, get up to things. In your dreams! Anyway I've got a busy day planned. How busy? Busy enough. I've got an appointment with Father Matthews at four. And then Sam's coming round. What! God! Isn't it a bit weird for you to go to church when being a vampire? You just keep your spiciest comments to yourself. I'm a sentient being and I'll choose which ever spiritual pathway I like. Well you said you were going to keep it to just the odd reading now and again. Well I can't go anymore. She said not to come along again. Got some sort of bad influence. Something to do with being a vampire. Bloody hell. What about privacy! Have you two both just used your powers? What if someone saw for God's sake? Actually your front door was open. Nice to see you too Jenny. Like your pyjamas Kevin. Such a turn-on. Emily have you bitten anyone recently? That's why we've come here. We're hungry. Do mind if we have some liver? How's the doctoring coming along Kevin? Been drinking anymore litres of donated blood? Aw that's a one off. Well doesn't seem to be doing him much good anyway! I hope you are not making any private references Emily. And please stop stroking Kevin. It will only make him bother me more. Sam says that you should watch some naughty movies together. That might do you some good! Sam! How could you! Emily's only joking, aren't you? Say you're sorry. Look I know we ought to try and keep as low profile as possible. And you think that living in that rat-infested slum won't be attracting any attention? Snob! Cut to the chase. How is Diane? Wayne's baby sitting her. We're keeping her at the station at night. And what about Jess? Isn't she getting she getting like suspicious? T thinks that Diane has issues. Probably wants to discuss them on the show. She has! She's been getting drunk a lot! It's great! I refuse to be provoked by you Emily. I mean what about this detective? Has Advent management been in touch recently? I don't know. Diane's not making any sense. And we all feel like we are being followed. It must be true. Have they followed us here? I guess. Lets make plan B. Pack whatever we can manage into your car. I'm not leaving. It's alright for you lot with your bohemian existence. With what Wayne and Sam have got it will easily fit into one car and you are all in the same place. Yeah, Jenny's right. We will buy one so we don't have to leave any of our stuff behind. Yeah, I'll sort it out. Are you sure? Yeah. I know about cars. Well It would make things easier. Do you need any money? Yeah, give me five-hundred. Plus I've got me bottle. Aye, aye I see that. Have you had some of that already today? No, none of that man. Hello. I'm looking for father Matthews? My name's Jenny. I rang earlier. Bless you my child you've come for your first confession. Thank you Father. Can we get started? Oh it's good to see you are so keen. Come on. No time like the present. My child you are in the presence of God. All sins and secrets are known. Please begin your confession. Please forgive me. Because I have sinned. Well a bit. Well in thought quite a lot actually. Oh I keep wanting to strangle Emily. Child it would be wrong to harm another of God's children. But it is good that you can confess your sins so that you may be forgiven. Don't worry about her. She's not a person. She's a little vampire who likes to wind me up. God wouldn't mind. We are all equal in the eyes of the Lord. Besides this Emily will have feelings of her own. Ou would have a job hurting her. She is a tough little bitch. You must drive out all these dark thoughts and rekindle love in your heart. I've slapped her Father. Oh it felt good at the time. But then I felt bad. And Sam, well he's my ex-husband. Well he sides with her. You are a tormented soul my child. Have you tried anger management? I would. But the thought of them getting it while I go without. Well it really winds me up. But you are married my child. I see you have a ring. Oh Kevin? He's another vampire. In fact they all are. I'm surrounded by them. You seem rather preoccupied with these notions of the occult my child. Have you spoken your GP about these things? We would all be sectioned if we did that! Father. There is something else. Do you mind if I ask you something personal? I'm not rejecting you. It would be wrong in the eyes of the Lord. Rejection? I've had loads! Even the medium's refused to see me again. Are you meant to be on medication? Have you got a psychiatric nurse with whom you can speak? Please let me help you. Will you come back? Same time next week then? See you later Emily. Come in and sleep with me Sam. Stop messing around. I've told you before. I don't want to hurt you. It hurts that you don't want to show your feelings Sam. I thought we had all this behind us. It was a mistake. A one-off. I'm sorry Emily. No it's now you are making the mistake. I don't care what people think. It's not about what people think. It's because I care for you. You know what I'm like. So are you going to go in there alone and smash another bottle then? At least that will keep you off the booze. Emily? Wake up. That was nice. I can't handle the feelings. Please you are going to have to leave. No. Sam this is what you really want. I'm trying to get some control back in my life. You are mine. Please you've got to let me go Emily. The pain is going to hurt us both. Does this really hurt! Give in and stop fighting. What training so they have in counter surveillance? I have never come across this before. I've never seen this before anyway. I would love to find out how the hell they do it. Not a word to anyone Sergeant Handyside. Sergeant Handyside we need more information. We need more intel. They've some method of avoiding surveillance. Give me the order sir. Well I'm not reporting back that we know nothing more. We would be a laughing stock at the station sir. Solutely. I've got a warrant to enter the station and arrest X-Ray Two tonight. Er when she is in the west wing doing the administration and photocopying. Can get an interrogation going. - Exactly. We have got to be a bit more proactive on this. X-Ray Two will not know what is going to hit her. Don't underestimate them Sergeant. Diane has gone dark in the last few hours. X-Ray Two may be daft but she keeps on losing us. Exactly. Yeah. Emily Jasper? My name is Mr Clarkson and this is Sergeant Handyside. We've come to arrest you. And I would like you to come quietly. What the hell are they doing here? I am sick of you lot taking me for a fool! Is there a problem Jess? Oh no! Only Diane who passes for a manager and people tied up in the control room! No no problem at all! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Silver bullets! You lot disgust me. I'm reporting the lot of you! Good morning this is Jess Edwards your early morning agony aunt. Feel free to call in with your personal and private problems. But first, lets talk about bad language on television. I'm sure we have all heard it and I think we have all had enough of it. Bollocks! I'm awfully sorry. Really I am. Just call in about anything you like! She's just swore, she's not happy with us. Stuff her it's none of her business. What shall we do with these blokes Sam? Help me get them down to the van.

I have feeling for her. For Emily? I know. No you don't. I care for her. But I can't take the fucking guilt! The pain! I can't take this anymore. Perhaps I should just blow my brains out. A silver bullet from Diane's gun that should do the trick. You're scaring me Sam I don't understand! I love her but I love you more! Don't you get it! Why didn't you say anything Sam! I've married Kevin now! You've kept all your feelings bottled up and look we've ended up? I love you. I fucking love you Jenny! Hiya I think Sam's in there because his car is there. Yeah he is. Come in. I think they're in the kitchen. Emily's arrived. Emily's arrived. Stupid little bitch! Shut up you stupid little bitch! Look you don't even care about anyone except Sam! Oh fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Re such an annoying little slut! - Shut up man you stupid cow! You can go and deal with them. It's your problem. You know them better than me anyway. If you're not too pissed. I've got to go. I've got to get out of this house! Your fault I hope you know this! - I fucking hope you know this! - Little slut! - Slut? - Slut! Slut! - You're the slut in the office! Cking kitchen with my boyfriend! - Yeah my husband! - You've got a fucking husband! - Yes I've got a fucking husband. You fucking greedy bitch! Two men want em you stupid cow! - Aargh fuck off!

Let go of Jenny. - We've got to sort this. - No! Please. It's okay. Sergeant Handyside, two things. One I've caught up with Diane. She's sorted. And two the plan to put them under pressure has worked. They're falling apart. Now we will take them out one at a time.
