- It's all cheese? - So? It's a cheese-cheese sandwich. Lucky kids! - But that one only has one. - No, two. No, there's one slice. So, there are three slices there. How can they learn equality if they get three and one? Give them two slices each, at least. Treat 'em equally. It's unfair. - So... I've valued your property. - Yes? And you're going to be pleasantly surprised. Oh, yeah? The market rate is 8,000 euros per square meter. That means your property is worth... 408,000 euros. For 51 square meters! We paid 200,000 seven years ago. That's the good news. You've gained over 200,000 euros. - The market's dynamic. - Well, to hell with the market! Pardon? Bastards like us are making Paris a rich ghetto. We're not that rich, Paul. We paid 200 grand. We sell it for 200 grand. Period. - That's absurd. - No, it's not. The system is absurd. Your system. You won't have enough for your suburban house. The buyers of this place can't be richer than we were. I have principles. The new house costs 450,000. We can't afford it. We don't move? - You want to stay here? - No. Well... - 300,000 euros. Not a cent more. - We'd have a mortgage of 150,000. - I have other clients... - No, no! 330. 330 thousand fuckin' euros. 399,000 euros. We sacrificed our ideals for a 399,000-euro house. - We had no choice. - That's what traitors always say. - All OK? - Great. Well, here's the paperwork. And here are the keys... to your home. It's ugly. Maybe, but it was my dream house as a kid. I lived up there. 13th floor. I looked at it every night. 5 years later Bye, kids. Bye. Bye, ma'am. - Have a good evening. - Hey, Coco. - Can they come over tonight? - Sure. Come over for drinks later. Sofia will be back. Come on, guys. We'll take you. BATTLE OF THE CLASESS He's a roadie. When he has a few days free, he gets hired. Hey! - Hi, hon. - I smell burning. What's that? - Who's cooking? Rice without water! - What? - Manon, you need water to cook rice. - Water to cook rice? Were you dragged up? Shoulda taught me. It's your fault I can't cook. - Act like parents! - I'm not your mom. - Same difference! - That's a nice thing to say. - No, it's not. - You make it sound like an insult. - It wasn't nice. - It was. You said: "Same difference." - Stop yelling, please. - Piss off, Gandhi! - What? - Don't stop rows we're not having. - You're not yelling? - No! You want me to hate my stepmother. Stop it! You don't understand a thing. - Come do your homework. - She's yelling. - I'm yelling at you, not her! - Thanks, hon. The bell. - It's Mr. Toledano. - Hello. Sorry to disturb you. Can I look at my house from your daughter's room? You'll see, it's astonishing. There, see? - That window. - Someone's there. Right! Actually, no-one! - There is someone. - No, it's an illusion. It's a new security system. You think someone's there due to that shadow. - And with this, I can see every room. - It's a big iPhone... - No, a little iPad. - It's great. - But... what's it for? - It's to fool burglars. Burglars here? I've never had the slightest problem in 25 years. Thank you. Adama, go back to your seat. Back to your seat. Stop clowning around, Adama. I'm going to get angry, Ryan. Ryan, I warn you... What's all this? What're you playing at, Adama? Why are you on your feet? Sit down! That's what I said. I'm sorry, they're a bit agitated today. Very well. Children, listen carefully. The canteen staff wish to know who among you eats animal produce of a porcine nature... and who doesn't? What? What I'm trying to say is, which pupils are in a situation... of being of an Arabo-Muslim tendency and as a result... do not consume... Who eats pork? We'll note your names. Very well. Now who doesn't consume... Raise your hands. Corentin, your hand. - I can't remember what it is I can't eat. - Gluten is what you can't eat. - Gluten. - Is there any in pork? - No... - No. - I can't eat gluten. - I'm allergic to pollen. - I'm intolerant. - Intolerant to what? - I'm just intolerant. - You're just a wise guy! - What's a stencil? - It's simple, it's written on it. You have to cut them out with your scissors. - Where are they? - I don't have mine. Paul, do you have any scissors for the kids? - In their cases. - They're not. I don't have mine. - They were stolen. - What? I've lost mine. The three of you have lost your scissors? - Are you doing this on purpose? - Coco! Where are the scissors? In the principal's office. Actually, a little kid took out his scissors and he cut the mouth and ears of another kid. What? What? A little kid cut the mouth and ears of another kid. And then, Mr. Bensallah didn't want it to happen again. - The blood... - He confiscated them. Coco, keep still when you talk. Keep calm. Is that true? Was that in the playground? - No, in their classroom. - Who told you? - The principal did. - I saw a camp bed. There was an ambulance outside school. - Yeah, a camp bed. - No, a stretcher. A stretcher. And they took him to the hospital. - When? - The other day. - No, before that. - See the blood? On the ground. - Were you scared? - No. - It's just child's play. - Stop it, Manon. - This is serious. - Look... Enough! Coco, why don't you walk normally? Flore and Eric, get your order. - Hey. - Hi there. Jéromine, can you feed the ewes? Aladin, alfalfa for the rabbit. - Hi there. - Hey. - Turnips, OK. - Milo wasn't at school. Hey, we're fed up with the Jerusalem artichokes. OK, good. We still have some apple juice. Was Milo feeling sick? Hey, let me introduce you. Sofia, Paul, meet Dounia. They keep this garden going. They're here all the time. - Aren't you in Corentin's class? - This is a shared garden. Hey, don't put that with the organic manure! - We're all part of it. - It's all of us. - We can rent a plot to grow things? - Right. But we don't use weedkiller or fertilizer. And we respect the seasons, the soil balance. - What if... - No oil-producing or climbing plants. Other than that, you're free to do what you want. - Free to do what you do. - Right. - So, was Milo sick this morning? - Yes. No... We've put him in St Benoît private school. What? Why didn't you tell us? That business with the scissors was the last straw. Kids fight in every school. - It's not just that. - Go on. - It's been on our minds. - Really? You know the state junior high. Next year, Milo will go straight to St Benoît junior high. - It's very good. - There's a 95% pass rate. - We want what's best for our kids. - You hate private schools. Too right. When we heard about Milo, we decided to do the same for Jules. - No way! You too? - Oh, right! - So, Coco's on his own. - I'm speechless. Look, the level at Jean Jaurès is poor. Why don't you say what you really think? - Too many blacks and Arabs. - That's not it at all. - That's what you think. It stinks. - Stop trying to provoke us. I'm just saying that Jean Jaurès is mediocre. I grew up here. I was at school at Jean Jaurès. I turned out OK. Times have changed. With all that's going on... Besides, Jules has been assessed as having high potential. - What's that mean? - Gifted. - Even the teacher told us to do it. - The responsibility! We're happy with Jean Jaurès. And state education is important. - Why can't I go to my friends' school? - Because it's a private school. - And it sucks, it's about selection... - It's not fair. You wouldn't like it. It's squeaky clean, not a hair out of place. - It sounds good. - No! Private schools are for rich kids, honey. So, are we poor? - No... - No, I didn't say that. So, why can't I go? Because it snaps the rungs of the social ladder. We're rebels. We do things differently. We stand alone. We're pirates! - Equal opportunities... - We're pirates. Attack! For the heights of Belleville Where I can see the whole town And for the wind which blows Around the tower block windows For the wet sidewalk For coffee and croissants And for the accordion that limps In the depths of the damp tunnel For the night on the riverboats And for your mouth Thank you. Thank you For the mornings on the pillow Because of paid vacations For cinema screens In the street sometimes For the devoured divas For the beloved fragrances For the sea because it is free And for drunken nights of reverie For the old walls under the posters And the fallow grass Thank you. Thank you. I thank you. It'd be good if Coco were gay later on. Yeah, later on, I'll be real gay! - Sure, if you want to. - That's enough, Manon. A gay in the family is great. It's classy. I can't do it, so we've decided it's him. Stop telling him stuff like that. You talk the talk, but you don't walk the walk. I'm not homophobic. I know you're not homophobic. No-one's more tolerant than you! You talk such shit! Come on, Coco. Wait, was that a complim... Wasn't it? No. It was. "No-one's more tolerant than you." I'm telling you it was. When I grow up, I'll be gay! Coco, stop saying that. - What? - Stop that. It's not my fault. I'm a big gay rebel. Hey, Coco. Stop saying that, OK? Don't say that at school. - Why not? Dad thinks it's great. - Yes, but no. - You don't know what it means. - It means guys get married. I'm not joking. Have a good day, hon. See you tonight. Wait, Paul. Come here. To Sofia Belkacem who owes her career to her talent and ambition and will have overtaken us all soon. Thank you. A few words about your promotion? I'm reminded of Mrs. Fitaire, my science teacher. She said I was gifted... at sewing. She thought becoming a seamstress would be great for a girl like me. She said I had nimble fingers. I hated her so much that she made me all the more argumentative. Great for a lawyer. - To Mrs. Fitaire. - To Mrs. Fitaire! We have to show solidarity with the refugees, like our friends here today, who have fought with us for 20 years. They played with the Bérus and Mano Negra. Please welcome Amadeus 77! He bans the use of condoms He punishes us for loving sex He's as tough as flint He's as stupid as my ex I fuck the Pope up the butt! I fuck him good! What'll we do with all these kids? With that fat old bastard? His cassock is all stained He's rotten to the bone Fuck the Pope! Fuck him! - We won 'em over in the end. - I guess. Despite the language barrier. I'm not sure it's punk rock they need right now. The political message is what counts. Excuse me. Hi! You OK? Had a good day? Was it fun? Come on. I'm a bit anxious when I pick him up from school. - Why? - I'm the only guy. That's not true. - You won't listen. - What is it? Are people rude? Everyone's very nice, but... they don't talk to me. - Do you? - No. I talk to people and they talk to me. Mothers won't speak to a guy on his own. - 'Cause they're veiled? - It makes me anxious. I'm not proud of how I feel. If I can't talk to you without you accusing... You can't handle the social mix. Well, to be a mix, a mix has to be a mix. If there's no mix, there's no mix, see? I remember Max Nia Kanda at school. The only black guy. My pal. His parents felt uneasy at the school gates. - No-one talked to them. - So? I'm now like Max's parents. It's true. Corentin is the only one. Only what? Only white kid. You say that to me?! I hate the word "white", too, but white isn't a skin color now, it's a social class, see? No, I don't see. What's he up to? Dunno. - Mr. Toledano. - Hello. Can you move your car? You're blocking our gate. What? We can't get in. There's a space over there. - Too late, sorry. - Why? It's Friday 6.04 PM, the start of Sabbath. - The sun hasn't set. - It's twilight. It's the 18 minutes before the actual sunset. - The texts are very clear. - Yes, so? I can't touch my car or any appliances. I'll move it on Sunday. Bye. - What now? - No, Mr. Toledano... - Park your car a bit further away. - I'd like to, but I can't. - Well, give me the key... - No, I can't touch the key. - The key isn't electric. - It is. It's a sin to press it. - I'll do it... - Don't touch me, you're a woman. - Don't touch me! - Paul... Paul, come on, it doesn't matter. Come on. It doesn't matter. - Good Shabbat. - Same to you. We say "Good Shabbat" in this family now?! Is that really what we've come to? Fuckin' hell! - What's with Mr. Toledano? - Hi, hon. Mr. Toledano is very religious. He believes in stuff we find totally absurd. You find totally absurd. He's a nice guy. Yes, very nice. He's just a bit of a pain in the ass. - I'm the only non-believer in my class. - What? - I'm the only non-believer. - How do you know? I asked them. - Did they hassle you? - No. - You shouldn't discuss that stuff. - So, what are we? What do you mean? All my school friends are something. What are we? - Nothing. - You'll be what you want. It's crazy, they all believe in God in school. He just wants to know where he stands. Yeah, OK. - Can you go to the parents' meeting? - I got nothing else to do! Make an effort. I really have nothing else to do. I'll go. Intruder attack exercise Children, put your writing tools away, please. Cut it out! - Put them away now. - Shit! It's time for the intruder attack exercise. Under the tables! A seemingly intrusive individual apparently carrying a detonating object has entered the school building. In this situation, two options are available to us: either escape or confinement. - Or we fuck the terrorist up! - Don't say "terrorist"! It's forbidden in the intruder attack exercise. - Why's that? - Because it'll frighten you. It's scary. "Seemingly intrusive individual" is fine. The individual is in the corridor. - Where is he? - Don't breathe. What's this bastard's weapon? I told you. He has an apparently detonating object. - This fucker... - Stop it. Get down. Get down now! Children! What's going on? What are you doing there? Get in your seat. Sit down! I mean it! Do you want to die? Do you want to die first? That's enough. Those who shout will die first. Stay under the tables. Do you want to be killed? Blood everywhere! Do you want to be tortured? - Do you? - Ms. Delamarre... Can I have a quick word? Come with me. Come on. I just wanted to teach them mathematics and French. - I wasn't trained for this. - It'll be OK. You do it very well. No, I said "terrorist". It's forbidden in the intruder attack exercise. Who cares about that? They hear "terrorist" 100 times an hour on TV. It doesn't matter in the slightest, OK? And they're only kids. Don't be scared of little kids, OK? Bye. OK, Coco? Had a good day? I have a parents' meeting. You go home. - OK. Can Inès come, too? - Do you want to? - I don't know if my Mom will let me. - We'll ask her. Where is she? Mom, can I go to Coco's? Look, honey, I don't know. - Another time. - Yeah. - Please! She's never come over. - It's not convenient, honey. - It's not convenient for her Mom. - We could do our homework together. - No, but... - Yeah... - Bye. - Bye. - Coco... - Bye. Are you sulking? You're not sad? So, because of the attacks, the school's renovation budget will go directly to making the school more secure. Meaning? We'll put bars on the windows of the first two floors, buy a new gate, make the windows opaque, put sheet metal on the new gate and a camera above it. - What's going on? - The window came off. I came to the rescue. The school's falling apart. We can't leave it like that. Well, Mr. Naveau? We should put silicone on it. But we can't afford to buy the silicone. But I saw a video on the net. You can make putty with chewing gum. So, if your kids can keep their chewing gum for me, I can make putty... - Ridiculous! - Unbelievable! It might seem surprising, but it's a good idea. Let him try. I know it's difficult for you and for us, but I need you parents. I need you to support us. - We moms are entitled to the best... - One at a time. We moms are entitled to the best for our kids. It's only natural. You must also respect the school and the teaching staff. - We do respect the school. - Mr. Clément, any comments? We moms are entitled to the best. We're prepared to respect the school, but does the school respect us? Why are our schools crap? They prefer to leave us in the shit. We're just scum. Dounia, I can't agree with you. That's not the point. OK, I get it. Are there any other questions for Ms. Delamarre? I have a question. Those little shits in your class... They bullied my daughter. I know those jerks. What'll you do to stop them? There are indeed some children I would call... worrisome individuals. But they focus on those who are geolocated in their immediate vicinity. - The thing is... - Translation! - Let her finish. - Can we have it in plain French? What she's trying to tell you is that there are two assholes in the class. - We're on it. - Assholes, I get it. Exactly. - OK? - Not at all. We'll talk about your daughter in my office after this. I want to suggest something. I set up a charity, "My Town's Trash". We go out cleaning up the town. We could involve the kids by taking them out to pick up the crap all over the place. I think we're done for today. Thanks, Marie-Cécile. Thank you. We're not here to... Our kids are tomorrow's citizens. Music & Dance School - Hey, guys. - How's it going? He's so happy to be with his pals. - See them? - Shit, yes. Hi there. They could sing something a bit more rock n' roll! - Doesn't Coco miss his friends? - No, kids adapt in no time. He has lots of friends. Inès is coming for dinner. Tonight? One of his friends. We see lots of people. We have so many dinners, it's exhausting. Well, St Benoît is super. - Yeah? - Yeah. Good. Milo is so happy. He made friends right away. - Sure you don't want Coco to go? - We're sure. The level is so high. No more than 20 kids per class. It's pretty, lots of equipment. - With all that money... - Yeah. What money? What you pay to keep him from the real world. What about mass? Is it rock n' roll? We'll see them every time we bring Coco to choir practice. Great! - Hey! - Hi there. - How's it going? - Good, you? - Are they your girls? - Yes. - Is Coco with the choir? - Have you noticed they're all white? - Coco isn't. It's crazy. It's in the middle of the projects, it's free, there are movies, dancing, theater, but no-one local goes. - They think it's not for them. - Right. Maybe it's our fault. Girls! - Was it good? - Yeah. Were you happy to see Milo and Jules? Did they talk about their school? I started enjoying the movies when I found a way to get in for free, through the back door. The day before, we'd block the door. We'd watch all the R rated movies. At 11, I saw "Clockwork Orange". At 12, "Emmanuelle". To get the kids to go to the movies, just say it's forbidden. So I should tell them not to go, to make them want to go. If culture was banned, instead of hash, there'd be a run on museums, the sale of books, modern art... I've worked here for six years. It's gone well. I bring you new clients. Aren't you satisfied with my work? Of course, but that's not the issue here. So, why her and not me? I'm as competent as she is. Sure, you're at least as competent, but it's good for the image of a modern law firm to be seen to promote diversity. Diversity... For our public relations, our image is important. And Sofia's profile can appeal to certain clients. - That's why I got that fuckin' promotion. - No... I want to be chosen for my work, not for my Arabic origins. That asshole... - Hi. - How's it going? I'll sue him for unfair positive discrimination. - No such thing. - It'll be a first. I'll quit. Everything's fine. You're doing very well. He didn't say you didn't deserve the job. He said he preferred you. Great! So you don't see what the problem is? Look, can the two of us talk? Sorry I'm so popular! I come from around here. So you don't see the problem? I'm the token Arab. It sucks. Look, that's not what sucks. The system is what sucks. - So I quit the system. - Is that why? - Is that ironic? - Sure. Thanks a bunch! - Anne-Cécile! - Hey, Sofia. We're having a meeting for those who get no signal because of the tower blocks. - It's Thursday night. - OK. Great. We really need a lawyer. - OK, Paul? - Yeah. - Did you get my email? - No. - Coming? - Yeah. Great. See you on Sunday. I'm counting on you. - You into beardies now? - I knew him at school. "Knew him" in what way? He was my first love. - Excuse me. Were you with Sofia? - Yes, she's over there. Were you with Sofia? She's over there. I don't believe this. Where is she? Don't mind me! - Pardon? - Don't mind me. Honey! Sofia! Oh, God, honey! I thought I'd lost you. - Let's go. - If you like. Where's Coco? Come on, Coco. Why did you do that? Why did you dive in? Ryan and Momo said I'd go to hell, 'cause I don't believe in God, that a devil would hang me by my feet with a fork to pierce my stomach, there'd be blood, and I'd be hung by my guts and... and... That's nonsense. You won't go to hell. When you don't believe in God, you go to hell. - You won't... - Of course I will! And that's why you dived in? It's because I told them I wanted to be a Muslim, they said I couldn't, because I'm a fragile whitey. - A "fragile whitey"? - Yes! So, you dived in? Yes, 'cause Maryline said I could be Catholic if I got baptized. So, I went in the water to be baptized. - Ignore those jerks. - You're not a fragile whitey. - You don't believe in anything. - I do, Dad! I'm a Catholic! - No, you're not. - Stop it. He's not 'cause some little bitch says so! What happens after you dive in? Then you believe in God and you're baptized and you go to heaven. There's no such thing. There is such a thing. And I want to go! - There are 72 Virgin Marys, too. - What is this shit? - Paul... - Stop bugging him with your crap. - Manon... - You're not a fragile whitey. Tell your brother that. It's not you. You don't believe in God. - You're not! - There's no God! - What crap are you telling him? - Stop it. He can believe what he wants. - No, he can't believe that crap. - Yes, he can. - Stop it. - Stop what? Stop... Just stop it! It'll be OK, honey. It'll be OK at school. I promise it will. Don't forget your Arab origins. You're not a fragile whitey. Others have to adapt to you. Say what you think. That's what a rebel does. You have to adapt to others sometimes. Only tell your pals part of what you think if it helps you fit in. You stay true to yourself. If you're strong, your pals will respect you. You'll fit in. And you'll stay true to yourself. Not bad, huh? Sleep well. - There's someone at Toledano's. - Isn't it his security system? - His security system. - What if it's someone imitating it? Or Toledano is home. You could be right. The problem is, your son is the token white. He should find a way to fit in. Such as? Soccer, for example. He doesn't play with the others. He should try. Soccer is the best way to fit in. He doesn't like soccer. There's no law against that. Their names? That's not the point. We won't name them. I'll tell you who it is: Adama, Ryan, and I bet Momo, too. Those three have pissed everyone off for years. We just want to find a solution, I don't know what. I mean... tell the kids about secularism. We do, but their interests come and go. Right now it's God... Shit! Don't do that when I'm working, dammit! Do I piss you off, asshole?! I'm sick of their security crap. Where was I? Yes, secularism. Well, we're dealing with it. Look, I often show them these photos. I show them these and ask them what they see. They say: "A Chinese man, sir." No, he's not. He's a Muslim from the Uyghur tribe in China. Incredible! And who is this? He's an Arab, so he's a Muslim! Absolutely not. This nice man... is a Christian. He's a Copt from Egypt. How about that? They're fuckin' stunned. It makes them think. Sounds great, but what about Corentin? For your son, I think the problem needs to be tackled head on. I'll deal with it. Give me a second. Just a sec. I hope he didn't... Oh, no. I slaughtered them. I massacred them. Problem solved. What did you do? I went to their class. I asked the guilty parties to own up. They didn't, of course, as you would expect. I asked Corentin to tell me. He wouldn't. I insisted. He still wouldn't, I really insisted. He gave me those jerks' names. I slaughtered them. You'll never hear about them again. What... What's wrong? Is she upset? What an idiot Bensallah is. A total idiot. Did you have a good day, Coco? No-one said anything in particular? Your pals? How was school today? Come on, was everything normal? No-one said anything? Ryan and Momo said they'd kill me for being a snitch. They said what? That they'd kill me for snitching on them to the principal. No-one'll kill you. Don't worry, I'll beat those assholes up. 167 Avenue Gambetta, that's Caro's address, OK? OK. I have a principle: I won't do anything illegal. You cardboard punk! My principles got me where I am today. Where's that? Do you want him to change schools? Your hands! Hello, ma'am. We're Corentin's parents. - His mommy. - Hello. - And his daddy. - Come in. So you want your son to come to this school? Yes, we've just moved and we want him to come here. We must, in fact, because we're in your school's zone. I know. I was given your file. I was a fan of Amadeus 77. - Wow! - I saw your group live in 1993. "Screw the National Front!" "Fuck the Pope!" Strong stuff. Those were the days... Do you still play? - Yes, we do. - Not often. Still fighting. You are sincere, and that's important. Where do you live? 167 Avenue Gambetta. It says so. 167 Avenue Gambetta. That's not far from here. - Isn't it near the Lebanese restaurant? - Yes... We often go there. - They're lovely people. - So nice. - Didn't it close down? - Maybe. - Yes, that's why... - We go less now. And before? - We lived in Bagnolet. - Ages ago. Bagnolet? My niece lives in Bagnolet. 56 Lenin Street. She saw you yesterday. Everyone knows you there. So, I asked her. She said she didn't think you'd moved away. Is that true? - I said we shouldn't have come. - OK. You lied about your address to cheat the system? It's pathetic. And you call yourselves left-wing. Typical bobo hypocrites! - Do what I say, not what I do. - No... We're sorry. - Do you pay your taxes in France? - Oh, yes. That's... crucial. Know what? Right-wing folk are less two-faced than you. Get out, Amadeus 77! Paul... "When the war is over He will do business with his father "The mother continues knitting The father continues doing business "The son doesn't continue He is killed "The parents go to the cemetery They find it quite natural "Life goes on A life of knitting, war, business" Jacques Prévert. It's OK. Oh, yes. Children... The principal wants to talk to you about criminal events concerning... It's OK, I'll handle this. Children, something serious happened yesterday. - Very serious. - Very. We heard that some children... some lowlifes, not from this class... Other lowlifes went to the movie theater to see a film without paying. I think it's outrageous. The film wasn't suitable for their age. It wasn't a kids' film. They went to see an R-rated movie. It was a bit risqué. It's serious, not funny. Those kids saw scenes that were a bit... I don't want it to happen to my pupils, OK? But how did they get in? How? They're lowlifes, what can I say? I mean the theater by City Hall. Know it? Le Cin'hoche. With the green gate. They went over the gate. Then there's a lock to get inside. It's fragile. Those lowlifes forced the lock. Anyone can get inside. - Just think. - Just push it. Yes, just push it. Alright, kids? - Thanks, Ms. Delamarre. - Thank you. What times we live in. Kids who see movies which are a bit... Here's our 13th-century chapel. St Benoît, our protector. The school also accepts non-believers. We've had work done to adapt the school for them. More and more students are spiritually deprived. We gladly accept them. As for school times, I insist on punctuality. I'm a lawyer, he's a professional musician. - OK. Paul Clément? - Yes. Exactly. You're in a musical group? - Oh, it's... - Amadeus 77. I love Mozart. I see you made a video. Oh, no. Oh, yes. He bans the use of condoms He punishes us for loving sex He's as tough as flint He's as stupid as my ex I fuck the Pope up the butt! I fuck him good! What'll we do with all these kids? With that fat old bastard? It's not to be taken literally. In other words... the lyrics... On the other hand... "Fuck the Pope"... More the singer than me. But no-one is actually fucking the Pope up the butt. - We screw society... - Just stop. Actually... It's a scream of anger which comes out in an act of sodomy... Paul... He's mainly the drummer. And the lyricist. Well, I am. So... But... We could have said: "I shit on Mother Teresa." There's nothing aggressive about it. Or "I screw St Peter." It's... It's only rock... What? It's not personal. I don't know the Pope. I don't even know what his name is. - We're outcasts. - Why leave the video up? I hated him... You hate everyone and believe in nothing. - I do believe... - In what? Not in God. - In the far left? - No. In an economic recovery by lowering taxes? No. - One free roll, believe in that? - No. You believe in nothing. If you give me time, I'll think of something. Oh, hello. - How are you? - Hi, Redouane. If we made friends with other parents, it'd help Coco at school. He'd be friends with Redouane. Kids copy their parents. - Redouane is bullying him. - They could get along. - We can't just artificially make friends. - Because of her veil? Will you stop that? Yes? - Dounia? - Yes. Hello, it's Corentin's mother. It's Sofia. - Hello. - Yes, hello. Well, I... I brought you some vegetables. - Are they? - They're from the community garden. As we grow seasonal produce, we have old varieties. We don't know what they are, but the nutrients are amazing. I also came to talk about Corentin and Redouane. The thing is... what bothers us is that... that regularly... I mean... Well, not very often... Redouane and other boys in the class... He's not the only one. He says to my son that as a non-believer, he'll go to hell. As he keeps hearing it, even though it's not all the time... he's getting scared... And of course, we're worried about him. And... OK, I understand. Yes, I understand. - Well, I'm truly sorry. - That's OK. But there's not much I can do about it. It's the truth. Infidels go to hell. And Redouane, poor thing... he can't do anything, nor can I. If I could, I would, but... I don't decide, of course. Sure. Yes, of course. I'm so upset about my son. No, but... Look, of course I'll talk to him. I'll tell him to avoid the subject. - Thank you. - Don't worry. - Thank you. - Sure thing. Would you come to dinner with your husband and Redouane? We mothers never have time to talk. It'd let the boys get to know each other. - Sure, I'd like that. - How about tomorrow night? I'll ask my husband and I'll let you know. Nadir, this is Sofia, Corentin's mother. Are you free for dinner tomorrow? I said tomorrow, but take your time. It's not... - I'll call you... - No, take your time. No, this is the way out. - From 15 to 17. - You were together from 15 to 17. - Were you in love? - Yes. Who left who? When I went to college in Paris, he stayed here. And that was that. You didn't leave him. - He may think you're still together. - Idiot! Will you stand his presence? What do you think? - Think Coco will be OK? - Don't ask every five minutes. I know. I know, but it's on my mind. - It's eating away at me. - Baby... You have to trust your son. He'll deal with this. They said they'd kill him for snitching. - What the... - You'll see. Mr. Toledano, do you overlook the schoolyard? Yes, the schoolyard of Jean Jaurès. See the high wall I had built since the Mauritanians arrived? I can sleep easy now. So, this overlooks the schoolyard. Here. It's just over there... No, I can't. - Can you see him? - No. I have a pair of binoculars. - See him? - Yes, please... No. - Here. I have night-vision ones, too. - It's daytime, thanks. Just in case... - So? - No, I can't see him yet. - You can't? - No. - No... Oh, yes. - So? - He's on his own. - What? - He's not. - I can see he is. - There are others. - No-one's speaking to him. This kills me. He's a rebel. Rebels like to be on their own. I hear they show sexy movies. - Let's go tomorrow. - What's the theater like? Who cares? We'll break in. We won't get in, 'cause they'll see us straightaway. - We don't know where the exit is. - Anyone ever gone? Yes, I know Le Cin'hoche well. - What're they doing? - What? They've come for him. - Beat it. - Go on, tell us, Coco. - Where are they taking him? - There must be adults... There are no adults in sight. You climb over the gate. There are two doors. The emergency exit and another one. - Draw a plan. - OK. - I can't see him. - What? I can't see him! - It's OK. - It's not OK! - They're hitting him. - Why put him in that crappy school? No-one here puts their kids in state schools anymore. That's the gate. That's the exit and the 2nd door. - We climb over. - We want to come, too. No girls allowed. - You're bastards. - Well, that's how it is. You're a bunch of bastards. They're going. They're going! They're gonna take him somewhere and... I can't take this. I just can't... - OK, honey? - Hey, Coco. - You OK? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yes. Look, you two go home. I'm going for a walk. - You sure? - Yes. Leave my son alone! You hear me? Leave him alone! I'll smash your fuckin' face in! Ma'am, you're crazy! It's OK, it's OK. Sorry. - "Sorry"? She hit a kid. - She knows him. She can't hit him. You still have a short fuse, huh? You can't do that. What got into you? Anything you want to tell me? Even if you don't want to tell me, you must. Understand? - Understand? - No. Hang on, I'll be right back. - What? - Your idea about the movies... It worked. They're planning to go tomorrow. - What about Coco? - I couldn't even speak to him. Everyone was around him, saying: "Hey, dude!" He drew the plan of the theater. He ate with them in the lunch room. They played together all day. Don't worry about Coco. Look, it's that door there. The little gate. Watch out for the old woman. She'll see us. Ghislaine, give them a little scare. There she is. Hey, that's enough! Get down off there! Good grief! - Perfect. - Clever! - She's gone. Let's go. - Yeah. Thanks, Ghislaine. Start the film. C'mon, let's go! It's open. Come on! Go on. Hey, you! - What? - Me too. - No way. - Why not? - You're rich. You can pay. - No... - Go pay. - I wanna come, too! - Fuck off! - Ryan, just let him in. - Fuckin' let him in. - No. - Why not? - Shut up! Why is he coming back? Hey, Coco. What's wrong? What's with him? They made him pay. - What? - For the movies. They called him a rich kid who had to pay. Meaning? They went in the back way and when... Shit! They said he couldn't go in with them. It was my idea. They shut the door in my kid's face! Called him a fuckin' rich kid! - Who did? - They were all against him. - Ryan? - Yes, Ryan... - 'Cause I hit him. - What? - What?! - I slapped him and threatened him. You didn't hit a kid, honey? - I'm sorry. I told you... - You can't go slapping kids! Coco has enough problems! What if the parents are crazy? - Oh, shit. - Who's that? - Redouane's parents for dinner. - What? We invited them, remember? - I didn't. - Yes! - You did. - No! - Don't open the door. - Please, Paul, this is for Coco. - I can't. - Please... - I have a fever. - Please! Hello. I'm glad you could come. OK, Redouane? Come on in. Thank you very much. It looks small from outside, but it's a palace! It was tiny. We had to build extensions. It used to be a worker's house. Thanks. Hi there! Welcome. How's it going? Hello. - Hello. - I'm Nadir. I'll take you up to Coco. You pals can play together. - Your pal Redouane's here. - He's not my pal. Leave me alone! I don't wanna see him! They're easily worked up. Up you go. That's his room. Go on. - Let's offer them a drink. - Yes, of course. Of course. Sorry. Do we... What is there? Orange juice? - No, thanks. - Soda? No, thanks. - I could make tea. - No. What about you? Yes, they look Muslim, so they don't drink wine! OK, well, sure. I'll give you some... No, we're Muslim. We don't drink. - It was a joke! - Very funny. - So, what do you do? - I'm a lawyer in family law. You must've studied a lot. - Yes. - Well... Yes, a bit. Not "a bit". - Some more? - Yes, please, ma'am. Funny you don't use first names. - The kids. - Isn't it funny? I think it's surprising. They're getting on. Really well. - Coco's a nice kid. - So is Redouane. - What's your line of work? - A quiet one. Why do you say that? He's a professional drummer. In a rock group. I was in a group called... the Rolling Stones. But they bored me. So, I quit. What about you? - Security. - Meaning? - A guard. - Really? - You? - I'm a free woman. Aren't we all, my dear lady? Free to be a mother, to raise my kids, support my husband. At home, I don't have... a minute to myself. What with the kids, Sofia leaves her things anywhere, the washing, the dirty socks under the bed... And I never get a word of thanks. Nothing. I work like a dog. - Stop it, Paul. - What? I don't know... They claim work frees women! That's a western idea. - True freedom lies within. - True. Our kids need us. Doesn't Corentin blame you? He's big. He can manage on his own. And he has a big sister. We're strict with Redouane. - In fact... - We couldn't study, so... - True... - We want him to succeed. In what? - I... - University. Business. God willing, a business school. God is more than willing. - We'll push him. - God insists. - We're the same. - The same but the opposite. We'd rather he succeeds at life. Rather than being a success. - Big difference. - It's the same thing. I will... I will go get more vino. - Want some more? - No, thanks. I won't offer you any. - Been married long? - 10 years. - Almost. - We're married? As good as. I had no idea. - For me, we are. - Not for me. Never considered it? - Yes. - No. - Dad! Where's the other tennis racket? - I don't know. There isn't one. - Corentin, will you get married one day? - No, I'm against it. But with a man, it'd be OK. That's different. With a guy, it's cool. He has... the same humor as his Dad! - Redouane! - Give it here. Let's go. - What're they up to? - They're having fun. Well, it was... Thanks for coming. - Our pleasure. - And we could go for a picnic. Sure. Redouane, hurry up! - Did Redouane like the movie? - What? - Did he like the Truffaut film? - What? Didn't he tell you they went to the movies? - You mean a class trip? - No, they snuck in. They went through the back door. - I gave them the idea. - Redouane, too? Yes, he was first in. - You mean you encouraged them? - 'Fraid so. No. Actually, it's educational. It's to make them like cinema, culture... - Stop it! - You call that educational? - Was Corentin with them? - He paid for his ticket. Oh, right! Call Redouane. You make my son cheat, your son pays. - No... What're you doing? - You've humiliated me. Enough of your ball-busting perpetual humiliation! Chill or I'll take you down. - He's needling me. - Nadir... - Get your gun, beardie. - Paul! What did you just say? He's drunk! - Nadir, please! - Shit just got real. Please, he's drunk. - He's drunk. Please... - OK, Nadir, let's go. Is it 'cause Sofia dumped you that you went to the dark side? - Oh, no... - What? We're out of here. Shit, Paul... What have you done? Shit. What did they do to you? Me? Why defend them? You hate their reactionary morals and religion. No, what I hate is your contempt. You should be ashamed. I would be. Did you hear how she spoke to you? "You're stupid to work, you mistreat your kids." - Why d'you smile at her? - Why d'you act like a fascist? You did! If they'd been rich whites, you'd have attacked them. - You defended your community. - The way you talked! - Like a colonial master! - Colonial, my ass... It's true! Shit! Why did you say... you were married? - To please her? - Well, maybe it pleased me. What're you talking about? What? You hate marriage. - What would it change? - No... It wouldn't change anything. You'd have met my Dad. But he couldn't wait for you. - He died. - We know that. Cut the crappy blackmail, OK? We're against marriage. We think it's shit. Stop saying "we"! Stop speaking for me! You're so anti. You decide for me! I can't do this anymore. I can't stand you anymore. That's it. Did you see? He made up with his friend. You've screwed it up with your shitty principles. I may have shitty principles, but I don't slap kids. I'll fix this. Don't worry... OK, so... If I touch you there... Does that hurt? There? - Can I have a word? - Sure. What's wrong? He doesn't want to go to school anymore. You're in a big hurry to rent a room. I'd say it's urgent. Here we are. Nine square meters. Communal restroom. 800 euros. 800 euros... So, that's... the new address. It's a popular address! Must be a big building. We rent a garret, OK? It's fully legal, so you have to accept him. Have to what? You have to accept him as he lives locally. No. It's legal, it's the law, that's just how it is. - I decide. We don't accept cheats. - I'm not a cheat. We live locally. It's his school. So, accept him, dammit! OK, Amadeus 77, there's the door. Good day. Unbelievable. My kid is in a bad way, ma'am! He's sick every morning before he goes to school. I wanna puke when I see him go to school. I can't protect my son. I'm a father who can't help his son. I'm a shitty father right now. I don't have to beg you, do I? Bring him this afternoon. Ask the principal for a leaving certificate. You're the best. Kids, today, sport and geography. You know, I wanted you to come to the movies with us. Ryan didn't want you to. They're dynamos which will make electricity. As you pedal, we'll go further into Europe. You'll learn the names of cities. The big cables go into the classroom. Why is that? Because they power the radiators and lights. Come in, Sofia. I was telling Mr. Abdelnour about you. Mr. Abdelnour is getting a divorce. His wife is French, he's Algerian. It's a tricky case. - You're the ideal person to defend him. - Oh, yes? Mr. Tardieu spoke highly of you. Nice to meet you. 3... 2... 1, go, pedal! Keep it up. Samira, is the light coming on? It is? Keep going. Well done! It's a draw! Wait, kids! Kids! Listen up. Now come with me to try on the costumes. Go on. We'll carry on later. - I'm Corentin's Dad. - I know. I have to take my son... somewhere. We have to go. OK, but we're rehearsing for the parade. With the costumes, so... - Bring him back at two. - OK, I will. Bye. - Two o'clock. - Sure thing. Goodbye. What is it? A lion? - No, Teddy Riner. - Oh, great. Where are we going? It's a great school. The kids love it. Here we are. I'll hand Corentin over to you. Hello. I'll show you your classroom. - See you later. - OK. It'll be fine. - Come on. - See you later. - Dad... - You'll like it. - Dad... - See you later. It'll be fine. Dad! How could you without telling me? I don't know, honey. You asked me to fix things. - I want him to stay at Jean Jaurès. - Look, I couldn't get hold of you. In a few days' time, he'll be fine at Turgot. Things will settle down. Stop it, honey. - I can't go on. - What? I can't go on. With what? Know what? Since you rented it, go sleep in your garret. What does that mean? I messed up over the school. It's OK. Pick him up, bring him home, then go. Hi. - Got five minutes? - Empty your pockets. They are empty. Can we talk? No. You know, the new security regulations, we're looking for dangerous terrorists, so empty your pockets. I'm here to apologize. I don't know what came over me. I spouted a pile of shit. I'm sorry. The teacher sent for us. There was me and Adama's parents. She told them to pay for the jacket. I said no. First of all... They're just kids, we should stay out of it. And I know that the kid's parents don't have any money, see? When I said no, the teacher said... You won't believe it. What? That Redouane should wear less expensive clothes. So? What does that mean? My son... Should we remain bums? Can't we help our kids get ahead? Can't we dress them well? I think she means that if expensive clothes are damaged, it'll cost even more, that's all. Yes, but... If you can put Coco in another school, do it. I can't. I just can't. How do you keep your beard so neat? That's a number three. I use a number three here and a number two here... I brought you a rock. - That's nice. - Look. - Did you do this? - Yes, look. There's a cable. See this? It's the camera. I hook it up, and it films. I connect it to the transmitter. Well, cheers. - Is that OK? - Sure. - Where are we going? - You'll see. - Where are we going? - Surprise. - Seriously... - It's a surprise. Never mind. Hello, ma'am. Let me explain. I lived in your apartment as a girl. With my parents, not you! So, I wanted to show it to my son. - Quick! I must go shopping. - Yes, we'll be quick. It's so weird! Oh, yeah, the kitchen! - There was a wall here. - It's more modern now. Yeah, you're right. - You kept the lamp? - Yes, my husband likes ships. It was my father's! There were bunk beds here. My sister slept on top. One day, it collapsed on me. Your grandpa would've loved you, spoiled you. And Paul... They would've gotten along well. 'Cause... Did I wake you? I was asleep. It's 3 AM. I miss you. I can't sleep without you. Too bad. I can. Honestly... You have a soporific effect on me. When I'm huddled up against you, I go to sleep. "Soporific"? Is that a compliment? That's not what I meant. Not soporific. Well... I gotta go. I have work in the morning. She left me, said I'd turned fascist. 'Cause of the school. There are no fascists in our family. Give her some time. You need to patch it up. Suggest... a trip, for example, just the two of you. Why not go to Florence with Sofia? Yes, or to Sofia with Florence, it'd be cheaper! Remember... we went to Bulgaria with our comrades from the Ivry branch? Stop it. Can't you see he's sad? - Stop worrying. Enjoy life. - "Enjoy life"! That's rich, coming from you. You never enjoyed yours. We did. You could've gone to good restaurants, not cafeterias. Cafeteria food is good. It's too late now. - Why's that? - 'Cause you're gonna die, Dad. You're gonna fall down those damn stairs to the cellar. - I told you to repair that step. - Then, you'll go into a coma. You'll be put in a home, Mom. You'll go downhill. - But I fixed that step. - No, I told you it wouldn't hold. That's strange. It's not like your Dad to fix things badly. It only takes one time. So... we have all these wedding bands. Depends what you're looking for. - A gold one... - No, she doesn't like gold. It reminds her of kids working in gold mines. Gold is suspect. Would you have... you know... a combination of precious metals? That's her all over. - No, we don't. - Yeah, well... that won't suit her. - They're wedding bands. - That's why. That's the problem. I'm the principal of Turgot. Are you Corentin's father? - Yes. - Is he with you? No. - Your son has disappeared. - Pardon? The door must have been left open. Is he with you? No, I haven't seen him. What about his father? - He's not with him either. - No way... - Everybody! Can you hear me? - Yes! Let's get ready for the Great Barbarian Parade! We're all going out through that door. We'll take Rue Anatole France, then go around to City Hall. Understood? OK, kids, you heard. Line up... in straight lines. All together! All together, please! I just can't do this! What's all this mess? Stop making a noise! Coco! Hurry up! Hi, guys! - Your costume! - I don't have it. - What was it? - Teddy Riner. - We'll find you one. - Corentin, why aren't you at Turgot? There's no school today. Wait, do your parents know you're here? Do they? Hello. Mr. Paul Clément? This is Mr. Bensallah. Just to say your son is here. - What got into you? - Nothing. - How did you come here? - We were worried. - I want to be in the parade. - You're not in this school now. - How did you get here? - I want to do the parade. You keep having fun. Come with me. Let them have fun. He's with his friends. What're you afraid of? If you leave, we're screwed. Know what that means to them? They're all French. But they only see Arabs, Africans, Chinese, Roma, Serbs... A complete jumble! We want whites at Jean Jaurès. Are we the whites? Well, yeah. Well, I'll be going. Bye. Bye. Come on out, kids. - Not that way! - Is everyone out? OK? Mr. Bensallah! He's still inside! Mr. Bensallah! I can't see Mr. Bensallah! - Look out! - Mr. Bensallah is inside! - Don't stay there. - Mr. Bensallah! We can't get in with those damn bars! We need an angle grinder. We don't have one anymore. We need to climb up, then down inside. Is there a ladder? - Not anymore. - I'll go. Mr. Bensallah! Are you OK? - Yes. - He hurt his leg. What do we do? Take off your clothes. Tie them together. - OK! - Coming up! Gently... It'll be OK. - My leg... - Gently. My leg! Nearly there. My leg! Take it easy with my leg. Tewfik... don't worry about the learners. I'll counsel them. I'll reassure them. Well done. - Yes, well done. - Thanks. - Without you, ma'am... - Don't stand on ceremony. I'm Nawel. Paul. You saved him, because you took off your veil and made it a rope. - You have to break free of religion. - You jerk! It's the opposite. I saved him thanks to my veil. - God helped us. - God! The veils are made in China. That's why they're strong. It's thanks to your climbing skills. City Hill runs that sports club. - So, thank them. - Yeah, right! Not so fast. This was City Hall's fault. I do believe in something. - In what? - In you. I believe in you. You're all I have. You and the kids. If you die, I die with you.
