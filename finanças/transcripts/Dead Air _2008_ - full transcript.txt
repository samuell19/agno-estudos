Some people say a mirror is the meeting point of the living and the dead Many priests use mirrors to summon the wandering spirits Or use them as a portal to the underworld Most people would never use a mirror to catch the spirits Nor would they enter the underworld After all it's not the toilet You don't want to go there You can see many things in mirrors Unexpected things If you put 2 mirrors like this you'll see many reflections Yet... if you look closely you'll see one of them is different The 13th one on the left will be... how I look when I'm dead 7,8,9.13!

The baby was crying when we arrived He was sent to the hospital We found the phone booth Which one? That one over there Who called it in? We don't know yet The informer left before we arrived Stop! Don't move! Take a step back... Yes, sir! Take a step back... Sorry, sir!

I'm Fu Wing-Sze What do you want? Thank you! You're welcome, I didn't do much... You saved my son When someone dies, their hair and nails will continue to grow Even when the mother is dead, nutrients in the womb can keep the baby alive Why didn't the killer kill the baby? Why is that? Sir, nothing from Missing Persons Keep digging. Check with Immigration I want the baby's DNA Yes, sir! Did you find the car? Not yet, sir! What about the phone booth? We checked the booth, no prints According to 999 the call went out at 3:20 a.m. About 2 hours after the time of death No one would kill someone and return to the scene of the crime to call 999 The caller is not the killer This is Lok Chun, leave a message Mr. Lok, your mother passed out We suspect she had a minor stroke The doctor was here. Please come quickly Mr. Lok, your mother passed out We suspect she had a minor stroke The doctor was here. Please come quickly How is my Mom? She's fine, we gave her a shot She's resting...

We can go this weekend I'd love to go but I can't What do you want, Miss? I have unfinished business It's not my fault! I'm worried about my baby Leave me alone! Leave my Mom alone! There's nothing I can do! I checked with the hospital As soon as the baby is well enough Social Welfare will put him in an orphanage You don't have to worry Can you look after him? The hospital staff can do that But they're not family Neither am I! But you saved him! It's destiny! I can't even look after myself let alone a baby What about his father? You won't help me after what I've done for you... This Tse Mei-ling is amazing She survived a triple suicide! That's an idea! Those who want to die are alive Those who are dead are running around How would you know? I honestly don't The negotiator did a lousy job If you offer her a million she'll bounce back from hell Money is not the answer to everything What is it? That guy the other day Steven, right? You know him? He's coming? Of course! OK You're coming alone? Yes! Last week... Hold on! Who was that? Nobody important What about the red wine? I got it!

They want my show for their anniversary Here's my resignation The fact you're sitting here means we can still talk We can talk What about the Boss? He doesn't like me and you can't help me What are they giving you? $2.4 millions for three years $3 millions for four No termination? No termination! What? What is it? Nothing...Cheers!

Send a team to the TV station An hour ago, a landlord reported an attempted burglary Nothing was missing but the burglar got away How is that related to the case? The apartment was divided into 3 rooms The one the burglar tried to break into was where Fung Wing-sze lived This guy is a suspect Either he left something behind or he wants something from the deceased Round the clock surveillance on the flat Yes, sir!
