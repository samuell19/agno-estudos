Any other needs, sir? -Well, let's see. Ladies? Gentlemen? John, would you like something? - The food does look great. - I think we're fine, Thomas, thanks. Please tell Cheryl that this is spectacular. - She's outdone herself. Thank you. - It's just fabulous. All right, everybody. Napkins, please, on the laps. This is quail and it tastes great. You're going to love it. How the grapes look like flowers. - Everything's perfect. - And we have walnuts and a terrific sauce. What you have to do is slice little pieces off and then dip it in the sauce. - Hi, Katie, Charles. - Well, well, well, well. What an honor. Only a half hour late. My baby. Hi, John. May I ask where you've been, Charlie? Hi, daddy. I been at the liberry. The liberry? Tell me something, is that any relation to the institution knows as a library? Come on, dad. Can't we have one dinner where we don't argue? I hope so, but I've told you. If you must wear that ridiculous gold tooth, do it outside. Not in my house. And take your jacket off, too. What were you guys doing before you decided to become rap artists and cut your first album. Come on, man. What that got to do with what we talking about right now, man? I came here as a... as a businessman coming to do business with you in your establishment, and you giving me the run-down on all this shit like you the police or something, man. This is what this place is. Isn't it a recording studio? It is a recording studio. I'm trying my best to accommodate you. I'm a kid of the street, man. Trying to do my thing. Trying to get on. Make music. Live a better life. Graduating this year. I sure am. God willing, with a little luck and a few bribes. Dad, why you always got to say shit like that? Why can't you just be normal? Why do you always have to be such a nut? - A nut? Excuse me? -You don't see me, like, coming in here and, like, talking about your problems. You know? Why you got to always fuck with me? Rich is like the guy behind the Cream Team. Is that correct? - Rich is in the mind behind Cream Team. - And his name is Rich. - Rich Bower, yeah. - The guy meeting us here is Rich Bower? - What you heard? Tell me what you heard. - Just some stories. Gossip and shit about all the trouble you guys might have been in. Well, you see, that's in the past now. We dealing with the present. - What we gonna do. -Actually, Cigar, to be totally honest with you, I can't give you a firm answer to that right now. We're really jammed up. What's going on, gov? Still negotiating, nigger? - I thought we had a deal. - Yo, this is the cat who owns the studio, man. - He's trying to take us through some... - Arnie Tishman. Feel free to look around. By the way, which library were you studying in, anyway? Surely you remember the name? No, I don't remember. She was studying in the library an hour ago, but ask her which one, and she doesn't remember. What the fuck you mean you can't take care of us, man? What's the problem? - Our money ain't green? -Don't fuck with cash? You don't like money? - No, no, no. It's not that. It's just... -Cash is king, man. What the fuck is wrong with you? What's up with you man? - Who's... - He acting like, you acting like you on drugs, man. These in here got you bugging the fuck out. - Who's your lawyer? - What lawyer's got to do with this? We our lawyers. What the fuck? You the police or something, man? We just trying to book some studio time. Fuck. What the fuck you talking about my lawyer? Like, you don't treat me like you do treat, like, everyone else. - Don't you start with comparisons. - Katie's so perfect. - Katie's nine years old. -Yeah, but it's like you think she's so perfect, and like I'm just this like disgusting leech that you have. With my friends, I don't feel that way. I'm having a good day, hanging out with my friends, going to the library and shit, and then you have to go and ruin it for me. You cut your first album somewhere else. You use this studio in the future. Come on, man. We gonna see you, man. We'll be back. This is why people be getting hurt, man. 'Cause when you make a person feel this sort of type of way... - And you shut them out. - Wait a minute. Is that a threat I heard? We don't make threats, man. We said we'll be back. That's a promise, man. You know, there's a time and there's a place for this, but I don't think right now, this moment, is the right time. Let's just all sit here and let's enjoy this quail and have a meal together. Hello? Hello Wren. Hey, Charlie. - You lighting up? -Charlie? I missed you after school All right? So I listened to Rae pour out all her boyfriend problems. Yo, that's good for Rae. I'm glad she's doing that shit. Of course I love you, baby. Love me? You do? Please. I love you, too. What's up, girl? Yo, what's up, Rich? What you doing? Yeah, I'm going to call you back, okay? - Wait a second, Charlie... - Shut up, I'm going to call you back... Who you talking to that... Hello? - Yeah. - Yo, what's up? What you doing? You're chiling? Just chiling. Did you have fun today? No doubt. Guaranteed. Yeah, that was nice, right? It was all right. I would go for it again. Whenever you're ready. When? Okay. Damn. Let me go down here and see what's going on. Slow the fuck down, man. - Mother fucking D.A.'s son. -Calm down. Relax, man. Fucking relax. Rich, come on, man! I got to talk to you about some really important shit. My nigga's gonna wanna see me. So you better tell him that I'm here, man. What the fuck did I expect from having this motherfucker working for me. Rich. I need to talk to you. There's some shit going down. There is some disrespect going down, and you cannot allow this to happen. Just between you and me. - No, me and you and every fucking body else in here. - This club going down. Shit that I need to talk to you about! I know Rich gonna slap the shit out of him. - Word up. - And his father's the fucking D.A. - Yo, man. -You can't be coming up in my joint, blowing the spot like that, man. What the fuck is wrong with you? Yo, I'm doing this for you, man. I don't do any of this stuff for myself. I'm working here for you. You know what I do with my life. These guys open up a club in your turf without calling you, without asking for any... any kind of any... and no compensation, nothing. - It's bullshit, man. I th... - So you gonna tell me what's going on at my 'hood? Fuck, I know these cats. Scotty and Erik and all these other motherfuckers. White cats that I know that are opening up this club in your fucking 'hood with no calls, with no nothing. I don't think it makes any fucking sense at all. What are you gonna do - about it? -What I'm gonna do? What the fuck you mean, what I'm gonna - do? What's your part? You got the information, right? - Yeah. So just keep the fucking information coming and you're gonna see what the fuck I'm - gonna do, man. - I understand, I understand. I understand what I got to do. - Later, all right? -Yeah, see, that's what I'm trying to say to this little knucklehead right here, man. You can't be like... or you can't act like you looking for rapping. What's up, home? He want to be a rapper. - Yeah? - Telling him everybody can't be a rapper, know what I mean? Know what I'm saying? Yeah, no doubt. Dean. Dean. - Like I was saying... How you set? You all right? -What's going on, man? What's up, Greta? Hi. It's a nice spot, man. What's going down? Yeah, cool. You like it? Think I'll look outside. Come on. Let me show you this. Shorty want to be a rapper? - Ran into your man, Will, on my way up, man. - That's my agent. - He had a wild look in his eyes. - We didn't know what he was saying and all, but he looked like he had something on this mind. What's up with him? Just a white boy trying to be - a nigga. -He even said what's up? To me, man. - Fuck all that, man. How's your game doing? - You got to come see me play Guaranteed. Some time, man. Young people are always more given to admiring what is wild than what is reasonable. That is a quote. Delacroix. I want to examine today, with you, the question of identity and is culture involved, and is race a factor? - Charlie? - I want to be black. I want to get into the hip-hop thing. Raven. I want to go there. Times are definitely, you know, different now. Things are different, and obviously now, you see a... a lot of white kids, you know, that... that admire and look up to the Black community and hip-hop and, you know, and rappers. - Wren? -I think if... I think if people are struggling with who they are, I mean that's a big thing, and being a teenager is the transition from being a kid to being an adult, and when you're an adult, you have to kind of know who you are. Marty? What's not healthy about, you know, choosing a style? I mean saying, you know, I should treasure my Russian heritage and then, you know, get all caught up with what's going on in Russia right now? I don't give a fuck, 'cause it's never gonna affect me. - Kim? - You don't want to be what people expect of your race. You know? Like people say, Okay, you're white. You have to be this way. You... you can't walk around and talk whatever, Ebonics, you know. And they're saying... I don't know. Sometimes, you just don't want to be... be what your race is supposed to be. I'm a little kid, but little kids go through phases. I mean, I like it now and I'm gonna like, stand up for it and be like, yeah, I'm into hip-hop, but you know, when it comes down to it, I'll be over it soon. But for right now, while I'm in school, and while I've got comfort and... and I'm okay, and all my friends are into it, I can go and hang out with them, and I can go and be a part of that. I can do whatever I want. I'm a kid, Shari? In America. Well, first of all, not everybody in here is white. I'm from the 'hood, I don't want to go back and live there. I go there sometimes to visit my friends, and they're trying to get out. They want to go on to a college education. They stay in school and get their grades so they can get out. And I have friends that do want to rap And they rap about stuff so that they can get out of the 'hood. They're trying to move up. They all trying to go there. I want to leave you with a quote on this subject of identity. It's from Shakespeare's Othello. Iago, who has no identity, says, "I am not what I am." Excuse me. Excuse me, my name is Sam Donecker and this is my husband, Terry Donecker... And I am a freelance documentary filmmaker. I'm doing a project on a phenomenon that I've actually followed throughout America of white high school kids who imitate Black hip-hop life, and I would love to include you in my documentary. This is something that's really important to me. I have a vision. I want it to be very - real and raw and honest. - You're looking for people like us? You think you... you think we fit this description? I think you do. Yo, what? So you want to know - why we call ourselves niggas? - So you actually use that term? The term, niggers? - Isn't that a derogatory term, I mean... - No, no. Nigger... nigger is a derogatory term. Niggas isn't. Okay, um... Niggas is like, Yo, these are - my niggas. -This is something that people don't... this is - exactly what I'm talking about. - We should introduce her to - Will, man. -Yeah! Will! You got to meet Will, his brother. Yo, he's - the true nigga. -This is my girl, Kim. I'm Marty. That's Wren, Raven, - Wren's girl, Charlie. -Well, I'm Sam. And Terry and, um... include me in... in your All right. Day, all right? - So you gonna make us famous, is that it? - Whatever I can do. That's good. So, where'd you learn how to make movies? Well, I went to NYU film school. Yeah, fourteenth is no good. We can do it on the, thirteenth or fifteenth. Okay, let's make it the thirteenth at two o'clock. - Um, hold on one second. Steve. -Arnie. - It is great to see you. - How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. - I think you know Rich. - Absolutely. We met here yesterday. - And I believe you know Cigar. - How you doing? Cigar, my buddy. And this is Dean. Dean's a point guard on the Rider basketball team. You know how much I love watching those smooth moves you got. You know what I'd suggest? For you guys to go take a look downstairs and get a run of - the joint. Steve and I will talk some business up here. - Friendly business. This is gonna be big for everybody. Steve, it's a ball to see you, baby. Have a seat right over here. I'm so glad you called and we got this thing straightened out. These white motherfuckers kill me, man. Yesterday, me and 'Gar come in here by ourself. No fucking deal. Today, we bring another cracker, and it's all good. Could you - explain this shit to me? - That's just your reputation preceding you. - But that's all gonna change now. - What I cannot afford is a corpse in my lobby, a Biggy Smalls, a Tupac, a body in my elevator. You know, that's not good for business. - So, what do you think about me and Greta getting back? -Back and forth, back and forth. It's your game, baby. Do what you want. Whatever turns you on. Yeah, she's writing her anthropology graduate thesis on race. - Good for her. - I think we're really gonna make it this time, man. Let me ask you a question. What do you think these white people really want from us, man? You know what I'm talking about. White motherfuckers out here trying to imitate us, trying to rap, trying to dress Black and all this shit. Bitches throwing pussy all over. What's going on with this shit? A lot of people just think it's like size. You know, the myth. Niggas got bigger dicks and shit. But I don't think that's it, though, man. I think they think they gonna get some kind of life-force or some shit from fucking with us. Had some white chicks in the park with me the other day. Some preppy little chicks, freaking them off, you know what I mean? Pops is an investment banker, orders bullshit, Central Park West living and all that. Shit, I don't know what the fuck she thinks she's going to get from being around me. I'm probably trying to get a little bit of her information and see what I can do with it. Yeah, but man, let me tell you something. White people are as different from each other as Black people. You can't just lump them all together like that. No, the thing I got with Greta, it's different. - What up, kid? What's up, baby? - Hi. What's going on? You okay? How are you? - Yeah. I'm a little shocked. - You all sneaking up on us and shit. I'm not sneaking up on you. I can't believe this shit's happening. Yo, we gonna make hits, I'm telling you. - Congratulations. - I'm telling you, we gonna make hits. - Where's Rich? -Rich is right up in the cup. He up there talking to Dean. You know? They're not in jail. They're professionals, and they just want to work, and I'd really appreciate if we can work here with you. Hey, how are you? What's up, girl? - Yeah. This is like real shit? - Just trying to do my biz, - that's all. Make a record. You proud of me, baby? -Yeah, I'm proud. I just want you to know that I care about you a lot. If you do feel like you're going, like - into a bad route... -I know what to do. I'm gonna come see you and get my blessings. Good, then. You know. Keep them blessings in your heart for me, that's all. Steve, four words. You've got a deal. Thanks. All right, man. I've... I've got one. I've got one for us, for... for Kim. It said something, I...I remember earlier. About I don't want any dick tonight. Dirty mouth. Just eat my pussy right. - I was, is that, Well, you know that's Little Kim. That's a quote, but... - Yeah, she's a rapper. - But... but that... but that's also Big Kim right here. Wait, if you're... making that sort of assumption, is it that you would like to have a girl eating your pussy, you don't want dick that night? - Well, I'm just saying like, guys for so long have just been taking what they want, just getting their come on, so it's time girls fucking get - their come on. -What about you guys, Sam? I mean you're straight and your husband's obviously gay. What's that about? Love. That's what it's about. And my husband is a very sensitive and complex person, - and we're crazy about each other. Right, darling? - Absolutely, my angel. I have a question for everyone. Origin of the word, fuck. Who knows it? What's the origin of the word, fuck, honey? Tell them what the origin of the word is. Egyptian... You tell them. Seventeenth Century, Charles the One. Fornication Under Consent of the King. I don't think I can comfortably be interviewed with this guy. Tell me what they can offer you. What is it? What is it? What do they offer you? What... why do you want to be involved in it? Why do you want to emulate them? 'Cause they're cool. They offer us, like, safety. - Safety from what? -Safety from... from like anyone who wants to fuck with with us. - Hey. Hi. I'm Mark Clear. - How you doing? Hey, there, bro. - I'm Mark. - All right. How you doing, Mark? Yeah, that's me. You're Dean, right? The you're the point guard on the Rider team. Yeah. Yeah, man. - All right. Good luck, man. -Good luck with what? What... what does that mean? - Well, basically, that's my way of saying, See you later. - Really? That's too bad, 'cause I had - like... something I wanted to talk to you about. - Yeah, what's that? I was just wondering if you wanted to make $50,000. Ten up front. What are you, some kind of quiz show host or something? No, man. I'm your future. Well, then you got the wrong guy, my man. Really, so like the outcome of some little rinky-dink basketball game that nobody gives a shit what the score is tomorrow is more important to you than making $50,000 in cash. - I'm starting to think you're serious. - I'm totally serious. I don't know about this, man. This is... Criminal stuff you're talking about, man. Criminal in what way, though? It's a crime against the federal government. It's not a crime against some old woman or, you know, you're not hurting anybody. You're basically hurting the federal government. Don't know if you give a shit about them, I don't. What they do for you lately? They haven't done too much for me. Look, here's the thing. I'm wondering. You haven't gotten drafted yet, have you? No. I'm just wondering, what happens to you after you graduate? I've got some more interesting things going on than throwing a game. I'm not trying to talk you into anything. I mean, if you don't want it, don't take it. What if I turned you in right now? Turn me in? I don't think you'd turn me in. Would this be the worst thing you ever did in your entire life? What? A few bad passes, a few missed layups. Who the hell would ever know? - What's in it for you? - Don't worry about me, all right? I'll bet what I wanna bet on the game. I'm gonna make a lot more money than you will. Think about it, all right. And I don't know, tomorrow, if you're around at noon, Time Cafe downtown. Okay. Nine hundred words? No way. I need at least 1,800. This is a major article I'm writing, darling. My God, look who's sitting there. It's District Attorney King! So, you boys were playing football? - What's the verdict? - Good hands. He's got good hands. Runs in the family. They see us. Billy. There's an odd-looking guy who keeps staring at you. Looks like he knows you. Maybe he does. I think I should make my way over and introduce myself to our illustrious D.A. George Wayne, Vanity Fair. Writer. I read your column every month. You're wonderful. You're the much loved, much praised District Attorney of Manhattan. - I don't know about praised and loved. - And you are Sheila King. Formerly Sheila Blair, assistant District Attorney, in charge of sex crimes. Very good. I interrupted your lunch because I was having a meeting with my editor and we're thinking about doing a story: Ten Who Run New York. And, Mister District Attorney, you're are on the short list with the likes of Donald Trump and the mayor. What do you think of that notion, young buck? You know, actually maybe you should interview some of his past wives, too. Wives? Yeah, yeah. He's got two others besides this woman here. - Okay, Marty. - You should meet my brother, Will. He's got a nice resume, too, you know. Is Will studying to be a lawyer? Actually, on his way to law, but in a different sense. You know what I mean, George? My son has a vivid imagination. - So it seems. - Yeah, I got a good imagination, George. - Why don't you call my office tomorrow? - Sounds like a great idea. - Yeah, we can lock it up. - I like that notion. Lock it up. Nice to meet you, George. Thanks for the intrusion. Ciao! Goodbye, George! What's wrong with you? - Why... the guy's a journalist. - Marty, this is a great opportunity for your father. Why do you fucking care? What does it have to do with you? It's his fucking career. You know I care. I actual... Watch your mouth. Are you being serious? Watch my mouth? Since when do you say watch my mouth? Since she's around? If you ever disrespect my wife or me in front of a stranger again, I will cut you off. Go be with your brother. Buy you fancy Avirex and Kangol hats. Go uptown. Hang out with him. You're scaring me, pop. You're really scaring me. Well, then go. Why don't you leave right now? Go home and pack your bags. Move out of our house. What's that supposed to be, a punishment? You bet it is, Marty. You play by my rules or you get out. You hear me? Support yourself. What would your father say, if he knew you were in bed with two Black women? What do yo mean, "What would he say?" Well he's the D.A. isn't he? He's the D.A. but that doesn't mean he can fuck with my life. Anyway, we don't even talk to each other. - Hey, Rich. - You all are ready to play or what? That's what I'm talking about. If cultural anthropology is to serve a useful function in the debate on race, it must eliminate bogus categories like Negroid, Caucasoid and Mongoloid. Race must be viewed not as a set of people defined strictly and separated each from the other, but rather as a series of color gradations. The blackest black not nearly so close to the lightest tan as the lightest tan is to the average normal white. This would not only correct socially destructive forms of bigotry which result from race-based analysis, it would also, to quote Henry Kissinger, have the additional virtue of being true. Well what? Well? My head is just... Forget it. Yeah, go on. Like what? - It's just somewhere else right now. That's all. - You want to talk about it? Something happened real strange today. You can't tell anybody. Nobody. You don't trust me? Well, I'm listening to the guy, and the way he was coming at me, I didn't... I don't understand what you're talking about. The guy who approached me was a gambler. So, what's your point? He offered me $50,000 to throw a game. That's the kind of thing Luke used to do when I was living with him. He would bribe players. - Why would you want to live with somebody like that? - Like someone like you? What's that supposed to mean? Well, he paid bribes. You're gonna take a bribe. What's the difference? Should I do it or not? Just be true to yourself. We have no absolute sponsor, no liquor sponsors, nothing. And we're going to open up a club in three days? No, no, we do have a sponsor. We do have a sponsor. What sponsor? Celebrity plus models equals bash. It's gonna be sick, I promise. Get on the phone right away and check all the RSVPs. Better stop stressing or you're going to die before you're, like, 25. I want it to be right. Slow down. Shit. White boys, white boys. White people Let me get a fucking representative up. Who the man in charge here? Back up. I want the man in charge. I am You in charge? Yeah, Scotty. Yeah. You here with me? Yeah. Pay attention to him!

You showed up. Yeah. I'm here. - Did you tell anybody about this? - No. Nobody. Nobody? Not even your girlfriend or anything? How you know I got a girlfriend? I don't know you have a girlfriend, I just assumed you have a girlfriend. I mean you're a young man... - So, did you tell her? - Why would I tell my girlfriend? 'Cause if you do, we're fucked. You know. You don't want to fuck me, right? I hadn't thought about it, but you know, I think I'll pass on it. Seriously, you don't want to fuck me, right? You're asking me some real strange questions, man. You know, there's gonna be a fuck fest and we're, both of us, are gonna be fucked if you should say... say anything to anybody. Look, man, I don't think you want to do this. You act like you don't want to. So, you want me to say no? Want you to say no? I don't want you to say no. I want you to say whatever you want to say. I want you... If you want to do it, I want you to do it. If you want to basically take a lot of money to fix a basketball game. I just want you to be clear with this. You're committing a felony. You're losing a basketball game for money. I want to be clear that. I want you to understand you're breaking the law. If you're fine with that, then I'm fine with that. Tell me you understand what you're doing here. I know what I'm doing, You got the money or what? I got the ten. I got the ten, then you get the 15, then the 25. Where is it? It's in the, it's in the bathroom. Well, it's not in the bathroom. It's in my underwear. I would go... I think we should go in the bathroom to get it. I could get it out of my underwear now. I think we should go in the bathroom and get it out of my underwear. All right, all right, okay. Let's go to the bathroom and get your money. Let's go to the bathroom and get it out of my underwear. It's crazy. The things we do to throw a basketball game? So? - Hey, man, don't try no funny stuff. - Funny stuff? You're like a pervert or something. I'm not a pervert. Yo, man, you are a mad strange man. Will you stop fumbling around and give me the money? I'm trying... what is that supposed to mean? What does that mean? Mad strange? How do I take this? Take it how you want it. What up, what up, what up? How you? Chiling. Checked out that club you told me about. Glad to be of service. What's happening? Same old, same old. Taking care of shit.

Do you talk like this to your parents? What do your parents think about the way you dress and talk? They hate it, but their parents hated what they did. So it is about rebelling against your parents?

And it's past time that we did something about it and took responsibilities for our own ways and actions. You know what I mean? That's why you got "Can it be... all so - It ain't that simple. - You know what I mean? It's never that simple. That's why after the laughter, there's always tears. You be surprised how many white kids do know what time it is, you know? And um, the same way we was taught when we came over here on the slave ships. We teaching now. You know what I mean? And I mean the coaches... So who are the slaves today? Who are the slaves today? We still the slaves. Regardless, the average working man is a slave. You know what I'm saying? We're share... croppers. We all share cropping. But the thing that is... this music is so influential and so real, there's not a wall built that can hold it down. Hey, Rich.

You know, she's... everybody's just a little crazy right now. You know how this shit is. Whatever.

So fucking what? You brought your shit here. You're always telling me like I'm some kind of your pussy... Whatever. Shut the fuck up. You've got to be chiling on that shit. Is that, is that Mike Tyson over there? Yeah, that's Mike Tyson. You filming everything and all that? It's part of the documentary. Yo, check the joint out, man. - Hey, yo, give me that shit. - Hey, no. What? Look, it's part of the documentary. - Film them a second? - You know, I'm not doing anything bad with it. - So what's up, man? -Okay. See this is me. This is what I look like Let's ask you some questions. - You acting like you're a secret garden or something. Is that really Mike Tyson? Yeah, that's Mike Tyson. - Yeah. Women in the Paleolithic Era. - The Golden Age. Breeders. Yeah. Goddesses. They ruled. No one understood procreation. How would anybody know without being told? People just go on being naive and ignorant. Yeah. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense. We didn't go to the bookstore. - Yeah. Yeah, we'll do it tomorrow. - Before noon or something. Keep well. Yeah, you too. Bye. Hey, did you know that women in the Paleolithic Era were like... What's the matter? The game didn't work out? I'm fucked. Nothing worked out. The guy was a cop. The guy who approached you? The guy who paid me. You took the money. You act surprised. You thought I should take the money, too. I said, do what you want, just be true to yourself. And what was that supposed to mean? That means free will. Your choice. And you chose to take the bribe. So, what's the problem now? You regret it? Yeah, I regret it. I got caught. But suppose you hadn't been caught. Then what? Then you would have felt good about yourself, right? So who you are is really based on external judgments and not any conviction. Are you listening to yourself? I'm in the worst trouble of my life, and you're examining my shit like it's one of your terms papers What happened? I guess. He arrest you? What do you mean you guess? Well, he didn't want me. He wanted Rich. What did he want? He wanted me to rat out Rich because of all the shit he's doing. And then he'll let you go? That's what he said. I don't know. So what are you going to do? I thought Rich was your friend. We grew up together. I mean, he went his way, I went my way. All his shit is about fucking with the law. That's right. And you've been straight. And now you just broke away and got nailed. So what are you saying? I'm supposed to go to jail? No, I'm just saying be true to yourself. What would you do? Doesn't matter. - Sorry, are you having a private moment? - Yeah. - Excuse me, brother. - I'm sorry, my heart is just pounding right now. I'm just so excited to just meet you and stuff and... and if I could have a minute of your time, just to tell you some things that I'm... That I feel, it would be wonderful. What can I do for you, my friend? I'm Terrence Donecker. What can I do for you? I um, I'm sorry. I'm so nervous. I met you... in... the Versace store... in... Los Angeles a while back, and I was a little drunk. - I don't know you. - No, I didn't say that we knew each other. I'm saying that I had met you before and I wanted to apologize if I said anyth...

They say I raped somebody, so just... You know, it's... you want to talk to me about it? - No. That's okay. - I'll take your word for it. Can I just... They put you underneath the penitentiary for the white women. I... I just can't... There's a difference? Is there a difference? I mean, what's the difference between the white women versus Black women? I don't trust no white bitch. Not so done got me up there and got me with that other... Do you want me to turn it off? Do you want me to turn it off? - Listen, stop, please, now. - Okay. Would you like me to turn it off? Yes. Okay. Yes? Okay, it's off. Please. You're not dealing with a animal.

I really. Please. Go ahead with that strange individual wherever he... - I don't think he meant any harm. I really don't. - Hey, buddy. You all right? Mike, you better have your fucking wallet over there with you, man. What's his name? Who's name? The cop? Mark Clear. What does he look like? What does he look like? Yeah. What difference does it make what he looks like? Just curious. Just curious. He looks like what he is. So what are you gonna do now? I mean you're definitely beautiful to look at. You really believe that? Yeah. Why would I say that? Think I want you mad at me for lying? I'm not gonna lie to you. I wouldn't be angry at you, 'cause no one ever expressed to me that I was that I was gorgeous or... But you are. You really are. Come on. You've got beautiful You've got beautiful eyes. Really? - So are you, and I'm in the phone book. - Really? Sam Donecker. Donecker. You all was loving it. Hold on for a minute. Hey don, a chick named Greta wants to holler at you. Greta? What the fuck she want to holler at me for? What the fuck is going here? Are you okay, honey? 'Cause that was great stuff... Rich right here. Speak to me. Listen, Rich, I've got to see you right away. For what? What's on your mind? Not on the phone. You're in a lot of trouble. I want to help you, but you have to come out and meet me. What do you mean, I may be in a lot of trouble? What the fuck you gonna help me with? Be at the Roger Williams Hotel, room 406, in one hour. Meet you at a hotel? That's right. Why you can't tell me over the phone? Just be there. Trust me. Let's get this shit straight. Ain't no funny business going on up ahead, now. Me and my man, Dean, been down for too long, since we was kids. Like five years old, you know what I'm saying? Shit. All right. - What the hell? Come on, baby, I'm trying to take a piss. - Go right ahead. - So you think Dean's your friend? - Yeah, he's my friend. And what would you do if you knew that Dean was approached by a gambler and offered $50,000 to shave points on a game? Shit, fifty thousand? I'd probably tell him to take it. I'd take it, depending on the circumstances. What would you do if you knew that he took that money, threw the game, then found out that the gambler wasn't really a gambler, but a cop? Then I'd say Dean got trouble on his hands. And suppose the cop wasn't really after Dean, but after his friend, Rich. And Dean decided to sell him out, have him go to jail so he could stay free. Then what would you do? Shit. I'd have to be double-platinum, 100% sure before I even thought about doing anything. Is that right? You can be. That's right. So what would you do? - Might have to do something to his girl. - Like what? - Depends. Whatever turned her on, whatever excites her. And what about Dean? What would you do to Dean? Don't worry about Dean. Yes. Take a break. You hungry? You know what? We'll go get some pasta. I'll take you to Scores tonight. I want to go there. I never been there. Will you take me there, please? 'Cause I need to go there. - Get a nice bite. -Only thing I got to do is go home and see my wife, get my morning run, take my kid to school and come back and go to the gym. Then we'll go there. The guys are here, Chuckie. What's going on, man? What's up, my man? All right. - How are you? - Hey, Rich, Chuck. This is Cigar. My friend, Chuck. - How you doing? - That was some crazy shit last night? - That weird-ass white motherfucker. - Just came to get some wisdom. Wisdom, yeah, really? Tell me about wisdom. Now that was damn wisdom. I've made too many mistakes to be a man known for his wisdom. Except you can't make the same mistakes twice and shit. Know what I'm saying? I made quite a few. Not the same, but I always get the same consequences. - Pain. - Shit, all this shit boils down to pain. It's like, you know that cat, Dean and shit. He got arrested for some bullshit, And he kind of like, trying to stagnate my process, know what I'm saying? Via where I came from as to where the fuck I'm going. That's a age-old story, brother. - Deceit, treachery. - Dude is in a squeeze where it's like, yo. He gonna get me rocked so he can save himself, basically. He gonna try to, it's like this police business and all that shit. All right, so this is what you're telling me. Listen, this is what... I'm deciphering from your... your vernacular. You fucked with a nigger. He got in trouble and he told on you. I got two possibilities, Mike. I can kill the motherfucker or not kill him. If I don't kill him, I'm going to jail. What... what's your suggestion? What should I do? You have a problem with somebody, you have to solve the problem. Take care of the problem. You're angry and you're angry about people that you feel that's betrayed you, but if... if you're not willing to be nice to somebody constantly, then you should kill them, 'cause if you're not nice to them and you have them around, once you empower them, they're gonna kill you or hurt you. So you're telling me I should go ahead and murder the dude. Whoa, whoa! My friend, I said nothing of the sort. I'm too fastidious with my words. I choose them very carefully. What I said is you have a problem, deal with the repercussions of it. Are you willing to deal with the responsibility of going to a penitentiary? I've been there. You don't want to go to prison. Random strip search, random kick in your ass, having dogs look up your ass. You know what I mean? Some pervert guard playing with your asshole and your balls. - Is that what you want? - You're fucking with words, man. - I'm not playing with words. -I know you're very articulate and all that, but My God. Come on, we're from the same motherfucking part of town, man. I ain't even understand that whatever the fuck word it was you just said. I'm trying to get to the point. In other words, in other words, a bug needs to be stomped on. But listen, I love you there, brother. Always will love you. Like Dean, too, But your guy chose this life, um, deal with that problem. You should come with me to Scores. They got good pasta. Come on, man, I got a fucking headache, you're talking some fucking Scores. Well, shit, man. that could relieve your headache. I'm out of here. Got to go, got to go. Cigar, what up, man? You ready? Let's make moves, man. See you tomorrow night, Mike. What up, Chuck? Fellas. What's up, Rich? Mister Roberto, talk to me. Listen, right, there was some trouble the other night in the club with him and him? Fucking right it was trouble. First of all, boys, this is my nephew, Scotty, and that's Frank. - Yeah, and? - Okay, so tell me what happened. - I'll tell you what happened. - I want to hear this. He tried to take half.

I'm a detective with the Fifteenth Precinct. - I have some photographs that I'm going to show you. - Photographs? You heard about the murder of that basketball player, Dean, from City. Great. Of course. I've heard of it. I'll be prosecuting the case as soon as we catch the killer. Can I see the photos? Those were taken about two minute after your son, shot and killed the victim. I don't want to arrest your son. - Does anyone else know about these photographs? - Nobody. What do you want? Redemption. I'm a D.A. I'm not a priest. That's why you can help me. A priest can't help me here. Let me tell you just a little about myself. My dad is a lawyer, okay? He's a very liberal lawyer. My mother was involved in voter registration in the South in the Sixties. She put her life on the line for causes that she really believed in. I went a different way. I became a gambler, I became a cheat, I stole. I did everything wrong. Don't know if I was rebelling against what they were. I don't know what the hell it was, but I also was very creative as a kid. I actually made guitars, and I made my own clothes. I'm very good with my hands. I can talk my way in and out of different situations, and it's gotten me into trouble a lot in my life. It's also... I've done incredibly well for me. For... Have you ever heard of, Saul of Tarsus? Do you know who that was in the Bible? He became St. Paul, the Apostle. They said he was an epileptic, and he had this incredible conversion. All of a sudden, he decided he wasn't going to persecute Christians, He was gonna become a Christian, like the most zealous Christian ever. About six years ago, I had a big change in my life. I had this zeal... I decided to become a cop. I had this girlfriend who was not even a fucking girlfriend. She was more like the only woman who I ever loved, you know? She was just really fucking with my head, you know, I think she got off on the fact that I was a criminal, and then when I had a change in my life, when I decided, I'm going to do something. I'm gonna persecute these fuckers, when I became this new guy, who I am now, she couldn't deal with it. She fucking... She left. She left and she, you know what? And, by the way... -What do you want from me? - I've been trying to explai... -I'm leaving in one minute. What do you want from me? I want to explain to you that, before I became a cop, like I said, I was a gambler. I got involved in some very situations. Okay? And there's one situation that I got involved with that is coming back now, that's gonna come across your desk. There's a guy named Jimmy Fordo. - There's a basketball fix. And I've changed... - I know the case. - Okay. - I think I understand where you're leading... Do you? 'Cause it's a really simple solution to this problem here, right? I can help your son out. You can help me out. We can help each other. I don't know, you see... What you don't... Know about my son and me is that... We're not close. He's your son. Will and I, we haven't seen each other for two years. I don't know if I want to help Will. And I know I don't want to help you. But I will have to speak with my son, and I will need some time. All right. Okay. I think you wanna... I don't wanna tell you how to live your life, but I think you should help your son. I think I could help you help your son. What are you doing here? What's going on? What's up with you? Why are you out here like this? I don't want those fucking hands on me right now, okay? Don't know where they been. - What do you mean? - What's up with you and white girls? Yeah. Me and white girls? - There you go with this nonsense. - You said you'd never go there Come on, you acting like it's my girl or something. What you talking about? I just happen to walk in and see a fucking white bitch with hair down to her ass and blue eyes with some granny underwear on with fucking flower prints on them. I mean, we're not married or nothing. I don't see no ring on your finger or on mine. I'm just trying to give you a reality check on how you're living right now, and it's foul. It's disgusting. - Why don't you come here and make my house your home. - It's not about me. What you mean it's not about you? I told you how I felt a long time ago. You're used goods. I don't want to be with you. -I'm used goods. You know what you need? You need to, like, go inside. You need to do some fucking searching. Figure out who you are before it's too late Come on. Can you pop the trunk, please? Hi, Richard. How are you? Thank you. Great. Thanks. Okay, there we go. Great. See you in a week. Thank you, Stanley. We're off to the South. What? Honey. Come on. What's the matter? I... I... I'm not sure. Please. - Come on, don't be... don't do this. - I'm not sure that I'm going. - No, don't do this again. Every time we fly. - Or maybe I'll go, but maybe I should go, just go solo. Solo? What's the matter with you? Come on, get in the car. I'm not going. You are going. Now, stop it. This is crazy. I'm tired of living this lie. Every time we go down there, we pretend, pretend, pretend. Stop it. Just get in the car. Just get in the car, okay? Don't! I'm a cum guzzler. Mike nailed it. - Stop it, okay? Just stop it. - I don't want to pretend anymore Don't pretend, then. I'm gonna let my... Richard! I'm gay! He doesn't care, trust me. Richard's known. Richard, what do I do? She's out of town, there's boys in here. - Stan, am I a fag or what? - Stop it. Stop it! Hey, so what? You're a fag! - Who the fuck cares? - It's clear, everyone knows but you! - You won't even admit it! - Of course I do admit it, I admit everything. - I'm fine with it. -Can you pop the trunk? I'll be going solo, Richard. - I am so fine with it. Stop. - You stay here. Get a life. Get a man. - I've got a life. - You were so into Mike the other night. - What? Are you fucking crazy? - You want a big Black man, not a little, stingy queen. Didn't you see how scared I was? I was doing that for you. I was trying to save him from hurting you. You're the one that was excited about it. You're in denial. I'm taking your bags out. - Don't project onto me. - Can you just pop the trunk again real quick? Please don't do this. What, it's like The Day of the Dolphin, right? Where you say you don't love me. Pa says he doesn't love the dolphins so they're safe. Pa loves cock. Sorry. I don't get it. I just don't fucking get it. Fucking just go. Keep fucking going. I hate this. Just go, go, keep fucking going. He'll come back. I really feel spooked about that kid, Will, man. I think he's gonna be a threat to us down in Harlem. Pop? Billy. Sit down. - Number one, the motherfucking nigga pops is the D.A. - Forget about that, Cigar. We got to get away from that kind of thinking. All that shit is in the past, man. Only hits we doing is on wax, man. We ain't killing nobody no more. You all understand? A police officer, took these photographs. He doesn't want you. What he wants is... He has a case that's coming before me, where he's indictable. He wants me to throw the case out. Cigar, you know that white kid wasn't right for that shit. Yo, man. Let me tell you. You know that. There is no way I'm letting you go to jail. We're going to have a new beginning, you and I. We can't do this shit, man. We're not doing it Let me take the stands for all of that, man. 'Cause he acting like we don't know what time it is, like I don't see you working a nigga, or what you need to work him for. A Detective Mark Clear. - Hey, yo, whatever Rich say... - Bower? This is Detective Mark Clear. Now, listen to me very carefully. I know what you did. - I know everything you did. - I don't know what you're talking about. No, no, no. Shut the fuck up and listen to me, asshole. You may think you got away with what you did, you may think that, my life is free now, right? It isn't. Sometimes people are lucky. They get a second chance. I got a second chance. I'm Saul of fucking Tarsus. I got a second chance. I'm not gonna blow it. You're gonna blow it. Maybe not right away, but you will. And when you do, I'm gonna be right there to nail your fucking ass. I'm going to annihilate you, asshole. You're going the fuck down. I'm so fucked up. In the Paleolithic Era, people believed that the female body was sacred. Because it was creating life on its own. They didn't make a connection between the sexual act and a child being born nine months later. So, for thousands of years, people considered that men were unnecessary. Yeah, okay. I know that's right. They were decoration, and women were everything. They still are, baby. They still are. Everybody looks great. Your hair, makeup. What up, son? Fucking right man. - What's up, Bro? - Nice to see you, man. How you feel? I'm happy you're here. You happy I'm here? Your face ain't saying it. I'm your man. I'm happy you made it. It's like, now, there ain't no boundary. We all in it together, man. Black people, white people, Asians, you know what I'm saying? Indians, whoever. Know what I mean? Looking on TV, seeing Japanese casts hopping around doing hip-hop singing, your record. It's a Japanese Cigar up there You ever thought of that? I don't think a lot of people wanted this shit that really exists like that, man. And they have no control over the shit. Nobody can manage hip-hop, man. Hip-hop is just fucking hip-hop, man. Got your morals and your common sense, and you got to bring out the true talent in It's all about getting up. Don't be afraid.
