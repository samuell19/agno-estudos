People are always saying to me, "do I know you?" I say, "yeah, it was that bar in Waco, remember?" They go, "oh." And they sort of walk away. No, no one knows my name. "Yeah, Jay, it's him, it's him." They know they know me, but they don't know from. "We go to college? Did you live... do you live in Seattle?" I remember I was in Hawaii, and somebody said, "do you live in Seattle?" I said, "well, I've spent time in Seattle." I'm that guy. As my fans apparently tell me. "Oh, mom, that guy's on again. That's... it's that guy." "You know that guy. You know, that guy. You know that guy who was in the other movie. He was in that TV show. That guy." If I never have a career like George Clooney, the big movie star that he is, I can live with that. But if I can have a career like Tom Wilkinson who does great, great supporting roles like every time out, I could... I could die a happy man. I remember being about seven years old and I ran downstairs, and I went into my dad's office where he was working away. And I said, "dad, I know what I want to do." And he said, "what?" I said, "I want to be a movie actor." And he laughed and just said, "well, son, you know, that's a... that's a pretty tough life." I have an uncle who was an actor, Henry Gibson, who I grew up watching on television on "laugh-in." So it didn't seem like that impossible to me. I remember at 15 wanting to be an actor because I watched a lot of films with my dad, watched a lot of the, you know, the early "bond" films, "Spartacus," all of John Wayne's. I'm a little kid. Every time I go to the movies, I get my popcorn, and I get my M&M's and I dump the M&M's in the popcorn and shake 'em up. And I’m, you know, sitting there alone in the dark, you know, or I'm hanging out with somebody, and it's like magic is about to happen. And I still get excited about it. There's all these pictures of me playing Robin hood when I was, like, three. I think I pretty much never wanted toys. I just wanted costumes. When I was a-a youngster, I had a little 45 record of Claude rains doing "David and Goliath." And if I ever was in a position where I had to go to bed and there was company, I would do Claude rains doing "David and Goliath." And I'd stay up for hours. "This is the story of 'David and Goliath, ' the young Shepherd boy and the giant." And, you know, the adults would all fall down because it's coming out of a kid. It's... you know, it's just something I could do and then I didn't have to go to bed. In the third grade, there... My friend Elaine rosen was in a play. She was in the fourth grade, and she got to play the king. And the king got to eat cream puffs. And I'm not being facetious. It made such an indelible imprint on me, that this would be really cool. Everybody looks at you, and they give you cream puffs. And then it should be this great thing when you arrive. You know, it's like this idea of, you know, Hollywood heaven that you'd go into. It's just fucking not there. I just knew there was nothing else that made any sense to me. I don't feel I made a choice. It was... it was... i mean, I made a choice of what school to go to based on that, and I made a choice of how to go about it, but I didn't... i didn't make a choice because there were other options. There were no other options. I don't know too much else but acting, and a little bit of, you know, I can read statues in Latin. The idea that you could learn lines and become another character by saying those lines just thrilled me. When I was a kid and I wanted to be an actor, I wanted recognition. And I wanted to walk down the street and people go, "there's that guy." And when it actually happens, it is a... it's... it's a weird experience. I always thought I was a character actor. And, you know, I-I think it's one of the coolest things that... that anyone can be called. I didn't used to. I was like, "a character actor? Am I that ugly?" I guess character actor means you're not the one that everyone wants to go to bed with. I don't know what character actor means anymore. It used to be character actor was like, you know, the fat guy or the skinny guy or, you know, the guy with the nose... You know, like this which is not that far from my nose. He's... he could be the bad guy. He can be the good guy. He can... normally, he's... he motivates the story, you know. He's the one who robs the bank or is the, you know, the father of the leading guy. I move plot is my... as I jokingly tell my wife. You know, I'm often in a trailer. You're watching the trailer and you're, like, "oh, what's this? What's this about?" And right then I go... "You're bankrupt, sir." Like, "oh, that's what the movie's about. Oh, I see. It's a romantic comedy." I like to say I'm a working stiff actor. People do have this misconception that unless you are Steven Spielberg or Jack Nicholson or whoever, fill-in-the-blank, that you're nothing. If you're lucky enough, you're going to get to make your living somewhere in the middle without getting too much attention, but working enough that you can actually make a living at it, you know. And it's kind of ideal in a way. And the bottom line is, did you get the job? They can call you whatever they want. I get recognized just enough. It... it's like I have this really nice low level of recognizability where people are only kind of gonna do it if they have something nice to say. I mean, I-I can just point at character actors I've seen over the years who I don't know the name of. I'm Gregory Itzin, by the way. They may not know my name, they sure know my face. "You were, you know, at the teacher conference I just had, right?" Oftentimes, I'll come into a restaurant and I sit. Somebody will say to me, "oh." I've never been there before. "Oh, we haven't seen you for a long time." This is the one I do hate. "So, tell me what you've been in." No. No. You tell me. I said, "I'm not gonna recite what I've done, so you can figure it out." I always say that if my wife would let me, I would wear a t-shirt that says, "hey, I'm on TV." Once I see the twinkle of recognition in someone's eye and they start making the beeline, it's... it... depending on their age, if it's somebody under 30, it's gonna be "psych" now. If it's a female over 30, it's gonna be "judging Amy." And if they're really hip, it'll be "deadwood." With "mommie dearest," the gay crowd knew me for years. Any kind of metalhead youngster would know me from "Terminator 2." Any punk of whatever age would know me from "sid and Nancy." People my age, it was "Willard." You know, "X-Men" now. I don't like it when people walk up to me and... like, they know me. I know you just saw me on TV, but that doesn't mean we're, like, buddies or pals. I'm going to be nice and cordial, but don't go punching me in the arm or don't, you know, ask me for my cell phone number or anything. Oh, the funniest one was I was with my youngest daughter. She was just a baby. And I'm taking her to cedars, to the hospital to get her checkup. This woman comes in the elevator, and then she looks at me and she goes... "Oh, my god! You're that man. You're that dirty man, and you have a child?" And my daughter's waking up. And I'm like, "lady, for god's sake, I'm an actor." But the best is when you go to a checkout counter or you go and, you know, and they're dealing with you and everything is going, and as you're walking away, I've had people say, "thank you, Mr. President," or something like that. So they let you know that they know who you are but they don't... they don't bother you. So, to have people come up and... and say they like what you do, they like your work, you got through them on some level... It's the most gratifying thing in the world. I think you're lucky if you are able to make a living in Hollywood any way as an actor, but it... i think you're very lucky if you get a chance to make a living doing different characters every time. If you look at the range of roles I've played from, "Elvira: Mistress of the dark," you know, to "Babylon 5. That's where we're luckier than the stars. I've gone from weirdo, freako psychotics to sensitive dads. After "longtime companion," I had sensitive parts with dying everybody for a while. Now, it's evil wasps. I'm constantly being cast as very confident, you know, businessman types. I do get a little tired of it. I'm excited to play somebody like... well, more like me. You know, jeans and, you know, a porkpie hat, maybe an attitude, earrings all three of the holes. I've lost work because of this. "We need the attorney who's gonna lose the case." "Yeah, well, Bob joy, he'll be a good choice." Or "we need the axe murderer who's gonna, you know... you know, kill the little girl." "Oh, that would be Bob joy, right?" You get typecast from the next five years, which is great. You know, it's nice to have an identity as long as you can keep changing it. I had to quit playing bad guys for a while because I had a casting director say to me once, "well, let's face it. You'll never play the nice guy next door." And I go, "what do you mean? I am the nice guy next door. Go talk to all the old ladies down the block and ask them who the nice guy next door is, and I guarantee they'll all say it's me." I was afraid to come to Hollywood initially because I said, "well, I'm going to get typecast. I'm gonna be, you know, the bad guy or..." "You know, the... the athlete." I'm happy to say that I haven't been typecast. There's one thing worse than being typecast, and that's not cast. I've lived my life for that, I can't wait to be a type, where people pick the phone up and go, "that's who I want. That's the guy we want." I don't quite understand people who want to play nice guys all the time. I think, "isn't that just skating on the surface?" That's so cliche. Yeah, I play a lot of nasty characters. It's what I get cast to do. I kind... i kind of look like an asshole, so I get cast as asshole characters. But sometimes I would find myself saying stuff like Bellick would say, having the same kind of negative attitude, getting pissed off at people and stuff. Yeah, I call it character hangover. I don't like having to go into the... this horrible kind of psyche of a guy like that. He's a horrible person. You know, if I got to play one more nice guy, I'm gonna cut my head off. I got an inner demon, a pathological nut inside me just aching to get out. As an actor, as a character actor, especially you get to play a lot of demented characters. You get to go places and sort of pretend like a kid. When we were kids, my mom put us in talent shows. And we were... we were so poor. I remember we were... when we were really young, you know, we lived pretty much in the ghetto in Detroit. She was in the living room one day pulling off the drapes. And she began cutting them up. She... she made our costumes out of those. I credit all my creative instincts from her. Well, a lot of people in the industry come from transient situations. My mother and I sat down one day, and we counted out that we have lived in 18 different houses by the time I was 18. My father was a pharmacist. My mother was a nurse. Nobody has ever been involved in acting. My father was a marine for 24 years, and then he had a whole another career as an officer of the bank of Burlington. Burlington, Wisconsin. He did that for 20 years. He was the mayor of Burlington and later a county councilman. So he was very involved in local politics and was not an actor. And as a matter of fact, confessed to me how difficult it was for him to do public speaking. My father was a monk. He left my mom and the family and became a monk. And we didn't hear from him for about five years. Well, we keep in touch, but he's a monk, so we can't really talk to him very much. My father's an electronics engineer who works in... god, help me, I have a book of his somewhere here. Uh, it's, like, microwave communications and... and solid state circuitry. And I get completely lost. So I had blond, wispy hair as a kid. Always did till the day I was... Entered college and almost promptly, it went into full retreat. My parents who've always been very honest and candid with me about my pursuit of acting, were like, "well, Matt, you know, you have a situation. And your face and your body are, you know, of a 19-year-old, and your hair looks 35. For a graduation gift, we would like you to consider a-a toupee." So I'm like, "okay. I guess... go over along route 20 in upstate New York," which is really not the place to go shopping for hair. In hindsight, you see now, but I get in there, and he's telling me this thing, "it's a weave, and it'll be nice, and you'll, you know... it's made... handmade in Haiti, and you'll really like this." "Okay." Anyway, it turns out obviously that baby doc Duvalier is down there making a mess of things, and everyone's throwing him out on his ass and burning everything down. My roommates were watching it on the news, and they'll see like, you know, mayhem. And, like, one guy's like, "hey, I think that woman who's running from that burning hut has your toupee in her hand. Look, yeah." Finally, they call, it's ready. And I go back to school, and I’m asking people, and they're all kind of like, "ah, yeah. Ah, yeah, okay." It's funny what you can talk yourself into when you... when you get into it, or you think, "maybe no one will notice." Then years later I've... I've gotten these high-end ones that are very... that are subtle. It is fun. This part of it, you know, it does get back to what you jumped into theater for in the beginning was to try to become something different, to look in the mirror and take a vacation from yourself. Get a load of this, right? It's supposed to be your maternal grandfather is where your hairline, your hair gene comes from. I won the lottery on that one. Well, before I was an actor, I was... i was a dancer. I used to, uh, spin on my head, believe it or not. My brother and I were... were break-dancers. This is talking, like, mid-'80s when the break-dancing scene came out to Hollywood when I was 19. It was to compete on this TV show called "dance fever." Now everybody knows. When I was 19 years old, I thought that the best thing would... to do to be an actor until I became a great actor, which was going to be when I was 35. I would go then into medical school, become a brain surgeon. And by 42, I needed to be doing brain surgery. And then by 60, I was going to become... i was going to run for public office. And that was the plan when I was 19. I'm a little late, especially on becoming a great actor. You know, it's, you know, I'm still waiting for that, to convince myself that I'm that. My dad who basically dealt with numbers all his life... His aunt died, and he got this trunk that was his mother's. And we open it, and it was full of mementos of his, like, youth and 20s. And there was a picture of him at about 27 singing in a night club. And I was like, "what the fuck is this?" And he's like, "oh, that's... That's me singing in the elks club at Hinema... In Helena, Montana. Pull up some sheet music. "Why is your name on the sheet music?" "Oh, it's a song I wrote." "What?" My mother was English. And I was brought up in Ireland. It was 1939. The war, they started bombing England, and they shipped me out. They shipped all the kids out of London. And they shipped me to relatives, to my granny and to my auntie Rita, who brought me up in Dublin. I went from in Yugoslavia being, like, a very smart kid, a very popular kid to coming to the states and being sort of the slightly odd kid who had, like, long hair and bell-bottoms and didn't fit into a group particularly. And the name... the name didn't help. Although I changed my name. It was the only time I went by another name for... i think it came from when we were first in the states, and I was just, like, three or four years old. And it was just, you know, I was too young to try to explain my name to people. I went by Jacob. In Slovenian, in Serbian, in Croatian, in all those languages, there's actually a letter, a separate letter, a "z" with a little "v" on top which is a "zhuh." There is a little writer... I can't remember if something... If it actually happened a couple times, things were misspelled, and I wanted to try to prevent that, so there's a little, very officious-sounding paragraph about the fact that they have to spell my name right, including the little "v" accent over the "z." My father was a businessman. And like a lot of people of that generation, they weren't allowed to really go after dreams. There was, you know, they were children of the depression. It was about making a comfortable living for your family, which he did. But he... he was the best dancer in the crowd, he had a way with eye, with color and design, and he had all these other talents that men were not allowed to pursue in those days unless you, you know, coming from a bohemian family or something. Yeah, I think he played the piano. I mean, he was into music. And there wasn't one Broadway show they didn't see, and we had the albums, and they were always playing in the house. And, you know, in our house, Gershwin was a god. And, you know, the house was filled with those outlets. And I think, yeah, I think under different circumstances he would have done something differently, but they weren't allowed to. He insisted I go to college. And when I went to Boston university, which he paid for, for me to be an acting major... This is, like, not normal behavior for Jewish families. I think I knew when I had his support, his encouragement, that somebody else, who could be a very harsh critic... All our fathers can do that to us... was saying, "I’m supporting you in this." And it was never... it was, like, you know the expression, "and I never looked back"? That was it. My dad had been a cop. And every day he'd say, "so why don't you get a regular job?" And he saw me in the west end. He actually saw me on the equivalent of Broadway. And he's sitting there, watching me, on the equivalent of Broadway, going, "well, why don't you get a regular job?" I was earning three times what he was earning, but bless him, you know, it's that old gener... That generation. My mom said, "you've got to take other classes. You got to have something to fall back on." I said, "if I fall back... if I have something to fall back on, I'll fall back on it." I deluded myself into thinking I could... i could do some kind of double major with something more rational and practical and serious like geology. I'm color-blind, which explains my only "c" in college 'cause they bring you a tray of rocks, and you're supposed to figure out what they are because they're green or brown or whatever the hell color they are, and I'm looking at them like, "beats me." We're gonna do something different this semester. We're gonna do a Shakespeare play. If you're in the play, you don't have to write a paper." Done. When I told my dad and my mom that I wanted to be an actor, they flipped out. They just co... i remember my dad, I can still hear him, you know, he's screaming at me, you know. "We sent, you know, we sent you through university of Michigan. And we paid thousands of dollars and god damn it, you want to be an actor?" You know, he just flipped. I applied for the Rhodes scholarship, and I got it and went to Oxford in England. And I did two terms there, which I really loved. Between the second and third semester, I got invited by some of the people I'd done Newfoundland traveling theatre company with to be a part of this new sketch comedy group they formed called Codco. We made our rent. We had a great time. We were making films on the side. It was a very creative time. And I thought, "I can do this." And so I resigned the scholarship and sort of ran off to join the circus. And so from my parents, it was that kind of thing that, you know, "that's the worst possible decision you could've made. You, you know, resigned the Rhodes scholarship, and you are on a track to sort of become something fabulous, and now you're going to be an actor." I started off studying to be a doctor. And I worked at a hospital from the time I was about 18 until I was 26. I used to sing in a choir. So I took some voice lessons at school. The last two years of college, I took acting classes, and I got a degree in acting. I thought, "well, I'll go to graduate school." That way if I can't get a job acting, I can teach. So I went to Rutgers university to graduate school for three years, and within nine months after I got out of graduate school, I was on Broadway in "les miserables." I was a swing. And swings understudy, like, 14 different parts. Every time somebody went on vacation in "les mis," or there was, like, an epidemic of the flu or some stomach virus on the show, they would call me in because I knew all the parts. When I first started working and there were lot of episodic TV shows where they needed the bad kid, the mixed up kid, the junkie kid, the, you know, the, you know, wild-eyed kid, and... and I worked a lot of those. I got my first series offer... Was... was ten years after I left school. The phone rings one day, and it's my uncle, Henry Gibson. He had called Robert Altman, who was going to be shooting a movie in the Seattle area and told them that I, you know, that I should call over there and try to be a stenographer, a non-speaking role. Turns out that they do have a small thing for me. And I sit there for a month and the last couple days, they give me a line. And so I get my S.A.G. Card. It was a big deal for me. In college, I did this thing where I could take a fly and then capture it. And you throw it in a Ziploc bag and freeze it for 40 seconds, and while it's stunned, you can tie a note onto its leg. You can tie a little thread onto its back leg with a note like... not unlike those planes at the beach that say, you know, "eat at Joe's" or whatever. Well, one of the guys, the last day of the shoot says, "that's... that's bullshit. You can't." And so we go down to craft service and pop it in. I have it, and Robert Altman walks in with this camera operator, John. It takes off and flies up and around the group of us. And everyone's laughing, like, "what the hell is this?" And it lands right on the French dp's zipper. And they all fall over laughing. And the show ends, and I go back to driving a cab. And I'm wondering what's going to happen. And a month later, the phone rings, and it's Robert Altman saying, you know, "I'm doing this thing, and you should come to New York. And... listen, I don't know if you can act. But that thing you did with the fly was so fucking funny. I just had to have you around." About a year after moving to Chicago, I booked a McDonald's commercial. I'm down for variety. And I didn't tell my pop about it at all. Well, I didn't tell anybody. I just said, "well, I'll let people catch it as they're watching TV." Now, that's happening. Mmm, mmm. And my dad calls me, like, that night and says, "hey, when did you do a McDonald's commercial? I just saw you." And I said... i said, "well, I started it about a month ago. I wanted to surprise you, you know." He said, "hey, that's great, man. You know, I'm really proud of you, and, you know, did they pay you yet?" And I said, "yeah, they paid me." He said, "okay, good." It's a great showcase. I was the only guy in the spot. In fact, that was my demo tape, was my commercial for, like, about three years. Now, that's happening. I'm the victim of medical malpractice at birth. And the nurse used too strong a solution of silver nitrate and blinded one kid and semi-blinded me apparently. I had 11 operations, which didn't really fix it properly. And so I had what was left... I was left with a milky eye. So when Korea came, 1950, I was... we were all called up for the military. I failed the medical because of the eye. So I went in the military marine and came ashore and went into the hospital to have a checkup, and they said, "you know, we can do something with that eye now because we've discovered this... we got this new drug called cortisone." So anyway, to cut a long story short, they operated. Um, it worked. I saw with this eye for the first time. I'm seeing with both eyes and then two weeks later, boom, blackout. They fought for four months, and in the end they said, "we can't save it. The whole thing's gone." And it's wrecking this one. So they took it out. And I go into community theater. And I get bet five pounds I could not get into the royal academy of dramatic art. Got in. But sailed in apparently. 18 months in, I was offered a job, my first play. I got a role in a big movie, "mommie dearest." I had auditioned with a nervous breakdown scene. Big buildup in the funeral home waiting to go in to see... I played the son, Christopher, going to see the mother in her coffin. And they'd never said good-bye, never said I love you, I hate you. And I spent five months waiting for that... that day of shooting to come around. Finally, they're shooting the scene, they call me in, and the director says, "okay. So Christina's going to come out from behind the curtain, and you two are just going to greet each other. You haven't seen her since... But you're just gonna go out." And I said, "well, when do I go behind and..." "oh, no, that's a scrub. No, we cut that months ago." "What's a scrub?" Oh, my god. And I-I was so traumatized by that in a way. Well, I ended up moving to L.A. by greyhound bus. But I did it, man. I-I got around without a car for a year and a half. Yes, it can be done. I'm standing out on the bus, coming home from an audition probably. And this young kid walks up to me, and he says, "hey, man. How come you didn't buy a car with your McDonald's money?" The problem about the pay... The pay works like this: It doesn't start off great. You know, you kind of earn your way up the ladder. I got my first job, and I was like, "oh, that's it. I can... i can work. I'm gonna work." Like, don't quit your day job because months between. I think it's risky to be an actor because your livelihood is so unpredictable. Everyone discouraged me. I mean, everyone. I would meet actors, and they'd be like, "man, you shouldn't do this. Don't... you're never gonna make a living. I mean, I'm just being polite. You're just... i wouldn't do it, you know." So I say to them again and again, "is there anything you can do that you think would... you would find interesting and be satisfying to you? And if there's anything else, do that." Some people can do it, and some people can't. And I don't know if you can teach it or not. I don't think you can. I went to graduate school, and they couldn't teach some of those people how to act. To this day, there are very few people that are actually positive and encouraging. When I see a young actor, all I do... "go for it, man. Go for it, do it." Great. You may suck, but it doesn't matter. Do it. I mean, you got nothing else to lose, you know, so... what's difficult is, uh, is getting work. Fucking hate it. Hate it, auditions. Sometimes when I get a call from my agent and they say, "we have an appointment for you," I go, "fuck." Literally from the time that phone rings, like, you have an appointment, you're like, "oh, god." Until it's over, it's just agony. Another address, another load of lines, another character, another room full of sweating actors. Auditioning is ridiculous. It helps knowing. If you want to see what an actor does, watch their tape. If they don't have a tape, meet them and talk to them because the audition process has nothing to do... it does not resemble at all what happens on the day. Well, you know what I look like more or less. And you know what I'm capable of more or less. Why don't you save me a lot of trouble and just offer it to me or not? No disrespect to the casting director, but they're not often good actors. So you've got nothing you're working with. So you're working in a vacuum. Get me in a room like this with two people who are exhausted and are pissed off they have to read people when they should be scouting a location. It's just... it's partly my... My difficulty of suspending disbelief, that you're going to walk into an office and, sitting in a chair, pretend that you're in the '30s at a train station or wherever the hell it is and reading for a revolution. And suddenly, I'm having to be reacting to a massacre that had just happened in front of me. And the line was like, "oh, my god." That was, like, the entire line in the scene or something like that. Like, "are you buying this?" 'Cause I'm not. "I guess they're saying it this way. Are they angry at me?" You know, it's like acting is reacting. What are they doing? What are you reacting to? Some idea of what you think they may be doing in the scene. The auditioning process is really dehumanizing sometimes. When you audition for a pilot, you're probably one of hundreds of people who auditioned for this part. Then maybe you have a callback, and you're one of maybe 50. Maybe you have a second callback when you're 1 out of maybe 20. And then, maybe they decide to test you, so maybe you're one out of five or six. They'll call us, we'll do a deal for you, so that they know how much you'll... you'll cost them. And then, you will have to test in front of the studio executives. And then, if you make it past that, maybe you're one out of three. It's a real mental discipline to be able to continue to have the same kind of fun you had at the first audition when you finally do that thing called the network test. I think I first tested in '87, and I had a friend who told me that "it's gonna be a hellish experience. I just want to warn you what's gonna happen. There'll be people throwing up in the halls. It's... it's a horrible thing. You sit in a room. It's two minutes. You gotta nail it. You sign a contract for thousands of dollars. You see your competition." I was, like, you know, I was, like, a... i was, like, a mess. You go on to the network and hopefully, out of the three people, you get it. Okay, so you do the pilot. Great. All right, so then, the next period comes where you hope that they pick you up. And then, hopefully, they'll become a series because they've done maybe 25 or 30 pilots, and maybe they only have two or three hours available to them. And so you're lucky. Okay, you hit the jackpot, you get on the air. Then you have to hope that your show is successful, that people actually watch your show because other than that, the network will cancel you. So it's many steps, and you have to be talented and lucky at the same time. You're going in there to be judged. You get one shot at it. I've also failed miserably at... At, like, network auditions, all that pressure. Incredible amount of... of rejection that you go through. There's ten other guys that are sitting out in the hallway, trying to do same thing you're doing. And they're all just as good as you are. Some of the happiest moments of my life were when I was leaving auditions. And I didn't even care if I got it or not. I mean, occasionally I'd care. I care. If you have an ounce of... of feeling in your body, you're going feel like, "damn it. I feel horrible, I feel... i... What did I do wrong?" I think it's hard for anybody who wants to be an actor, but I think it would be foolish to think that race doesn't matter. Most of the roles that are written are for white actors and actresses. You never know why you get a job, and you never know why you don't. It could be you get hired because you remind the director of his wife's brother. It could be you don't get hired because you remind the director of his wife's brother. Sometimes you can go into a room, and you're having a wonderful time with people. And you really got a hold of it. And other times, some guy's looking down here saying, "what time's lunch? We got this..." you're thinking, "we got this cast already." I remember a director, who will remain nameless, and I went in to audition for this movie. And he turned to the... he turned to the casting guy. And he went... So I waited for five years to get my next audition with this guy because I was gonna wrap a chair around his head. This was great. I came in for the next job, and it was about five years later. And... I came in for the job, and I just pulled up the chair, and I sat, and I looked at him, like, "okay, open your mouth. Open your mouth, okay? Say anything." And he looked at me, and he said, "you know, you have the best face for a western I've ever seen. You got the blue eyes and that anger in you. I want you for this movie." I went, "oh, okay." And he got in a fistfight with the star the next day and was fired off the movie. I don't think he's worked since. And then a great director that I had worked with before came in and said, "no, kid... you're... You're... I'm sorry. You're a good actor. You're wrong for the part." I never got the job. But it's funny, so you never know how an audition is going to turn out. To learn the craft of audition, first of all, you have to be a reader in an audition, you have to watch 50 guys walk in and watch how 42 of 'em were dead before they hit the chair. They, you know, they've lost the job before they opened their mouth. In this business, you just keep going forward. If you... if you start to worry about it too much, you lose your nut. You lose your... you lose your presence when you walk into a room. If you're there jonesing for a job, and you need this job bad, no way you'll get hired. There's a point to which the butterflies can really trip you up. I mean, they can really chew... Chew you up too much. If the audition... here's how... Is when it really hurts you. The audition is really important, and it's the only audition you've had in six months, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? When you go into an audition, and you must book the job to save your S.A.G. Insurance or to... to pay your rent, unfortunately, that tends to work against you when it comes to actually booking the part because people feel that you're desperate for a job, and... and that can be off-putting. The times that it works best for me is when I don't care, when I really don't care. I mean, the last pilot I got a few years back, I had a 103 fever, and I didn't want to be there, and I didn't want to go. And somebody was calling me, "just get out of bed and go there." "Okay, I'm going, I'm going." "Well, you gotta go back to the network." "No, I'm not." And they'd... okay. They hired you. A part of me still loves to audition because it's... it's getting to do a performance one time, in a... in a room. Sometimes that's the only chance you're gonna get to act. This day, this week, this month, that audition. Usually, I don't bring glasses to an audition because they get in the way. But for the part of sid, the scene was him examining a cadaver. So I brought my glasses, and at a certain point, I put them up and then, it just... and it helped me get the part. Far more often than any compliment about my acting in that role is compliments about my glasses. I think people like my glasses more than my character. I'm jealous of my glasses, that's how petty I can be. Donna calls and says, "hey, how tall are you?" I said, "I'm about... i don't know, 6'2", you know. Maybe 210 pounds." She says, "no, you're 6'4." And I said, "why?" She says, "because Steven Bochco's... you know this show called 'murder one'?" I said, "yeah, yeah, yeah. I love 'murder one.' you know, it's a great show." She says, "yeah, they're doing year two, and they want... they're looking for an actor who is about 6'4", 6'3", 6'4" and can convincingly look like he plays pro basketball." And I said, "well, I don't... I don't play a lick of basketball, but I can... i can lie my ass off and say that I can." I wore some skecher boots that gave me about an inch and a half height. And I kind of dressed up a little flashy, you know, for the character because he's, you know, $50 million NBA star. I'm coming home on the bus on Melrose Avenue. I didn't have a cell phone at the time. I had a beeper. Donna calls, and I was like, "oh, my god. This could be it." I pull the bell on the bus and get off at the next stop and run to the nearest pay phone to call Donna. She says, "are you... are you anywhere sitting down right now?" And that's all she had to say. Dude, I'm going to start crying right now. And she said... she said, "you got the job." She said, "they loved you, and you're going to be working for a while." They guaranteed him, I believe, nine episodes, and with that money, he got himself a real junk of a car, but at least it could get him around. It got me off the bus. To this day, out of all the things that I've done in the last 12 years, "murder one" has to be the top, like, probably the top two jobs I've ever had. When it was over, I was just like, "wow, man. I would love to stay on this level," you know. But, you know, being an actor means your career is going to go like this. I auditioned for about a year to... i unlearned everything I learned in theater school to get a job on TV. And I-I got a job. I would say that getting a job is a 50/50 deal. It's luck and skill. Certainly, if I hadn't had luck in certain opportunities, I might not have survived this business. I would say the fir... The first job's luck, the second job... Is luck. Third job, you gotta know what you're doing because if you suck, you suck. And by the third job, they figure that out. We are working actors because we work. The job comes, and we pretty much take it. Okay, so a project will come up, like "the hills have eyes." And I read this script, and I thought, "no." So you say, "I'm not gonna do it unless what I get out of it makes a big difference, maybe to my private life." So it'll be tuition for my daughter to go to nyu. It will, you know, pay bills. I mean, let's be practical. One of the big sequences is this clan member whose name is Ruby, the same name as my daughter, is trying to save this baby's life. And I'm saying I'm trying to kill the baby to serve it up for dinner. Just reminded me of actually chasing my little girl when she was a little girl around the dining room table saying, "I'm gonna get you." My daughter Ruby has not seen that movie. I hope she never sees the movie. I've had people saying, "you got to be careful, and you can't just do crap." Then there are other people like Anthony Quinn that says, "son, do everything. Do everything that's thrown at you because you never know what's gonna be successful a year from now. You'll never know what won't." I'm a hack, I'm a prostitute. I can't choose what my customers are. There's some cheesy stuff that I would die if it was still playing. There are a couple of movies I've done that really are kind of dumb, and I-I didn't mean to kind of send people down the wrong Avenue. I turned down a tinto brass movie because it opens with the... my... one of the great quotes, which is, "the old man stood there behind the maid, showing us his gnarled and wrinkled genitalia." And I thought, "I don't think I'm going to be doing this one." Yeah, there's lots about acting I don't like. When it's not going well, when you're working with uncreative people. There's a couple of TV jobs that I didn't like the experience of or looked at and said, "what am I doing here? Oh, do I really want to do this for a living?" I guess I have a motto, which is, "I'll stick around to be insulted one more time." Very few people achieve the success that I think everybody dreams of. And so in Hollywood, there's a lot of angry people who feel like they'd been dealt... If only they could have... if they'd have been, blah, blah, blah. I worked with an idiot on a film three years ago. And she is the biggest... the biggest diva I've ever worked with, like a completely pampered former television star who's doing film, who I-I just... Thank god a more senior actor on set took her aside and said, "who the fuck do you think you are, talking to people like this?" Because she was impossible. Now, I'm older and if it's... Somebody starts messing with me, I just tell them right off the bat, "stop fucking with me." I'm lucky I'm at my age, and I get... i tend to get respect, which is okay. And if I don't, I'll get it. You know, I'll punch your head in. I was very reluctant to turn a job down, and I remember I had this great agent, and she was like, "boy, you got to grow some balls. You know what? You got to learn how to say no. 'No' is the password to the next level." True or false: All actors are crazy. True. Prior to... just prior to getting into the drama department, I thought everyone was gay or out of their minds. And they are. I'm in the latter category, out of my mind. I'm with your mommy, you know that, right? I don't think I am. I mean, I'm a little batty. You got to be crazy to do this. You got... you got to have a screw loose. Why not live just an easygoing, calm life like the average bear, you know, and just take what life is... throws at you and deal with that? No, we've got to read a play about, you know, our parents dying in a car accident when they're young. And then they grow up, and they lose everything in a great depression and then are reborn by some miracle of Deus ex machina that, you know, saves them from the fiery pit in the end, and then, you know, you go out to your applause. Everybody does "Star Trek." Some of us more than once. I've done four "star treks." "Next generation..." "Voyager," two movies. I've been a ferengi. I've had foam cheeks of ass glued to my forehead. I've done a number of "star treks." "Star Trek" was always about... to me, it's almost Shakespearean. You have to be able to handle the language, which is, you know, a little stilted, a little theatrical, a little larger than life. I think my first job in L.A. was "Star Trek: Voyager," and I played a robot. Oh, I did "Star Trek: Voyager." This time I was human. The last "Star Trek" series, "Star Trek: Enterprise," my guy is a sloth... So he'd look a lot like Chewbacca. To this day, I say it's one of the best jobs any actor could have. For me to take a bunch of words that on the paper looked like something out of an encyclopedia and convincing the viewership that this is a real person saying some really interesting stuff... I know how to do that. I often play lawyers and doctors, and I have a great deal of difficulty with legalese or medical technology because I don't... it doesn't mean anything. I don't even know what it... What I'm talking about. You know, you read these things. You go, "what are you talking about?" No one sounds like a human being. You know when you have a mouth full of horseshit to say, you just got to get all out of your mouth. Save it there, and you can be anywhere you want until the last word. In TV, you got to know it fast and you got it... because you can get offered a job today and start shooting tomorrow. They booked me at 11:30 at night. The script never arrived there till 1:30. And I had to be there at 6:30. I was actually going to literally walk into costume because I had to get all my suits coming in, learning the stuff, trying to learn it, trying to learn it, trying to learn it. There isn't one part of what I do that I don't like. From the minute they say, "we're ready for you in hair and makeup. What would you like for breakfast? Can we get a rehearsal? Your wardrobe is ready." I like every part of it. You know what, I've never had a bad experience. I've got to be honest with you. I've never not wanted to go to work. I've always loved the environment of the film business, you know what I mean? But my best ever job overall for the whole experience was, I think, "cliffhanger." To get off that plane and all of a sudden, find myself within my own dream, but it was real. I used to pinch myself every day. "I'm in a Hollywood action movie with Sylvester Stallone." It was constant. And you know what? At the end of the day, it was a tiny part. And still now when it's on, because it's on every other day, just seeing your name on the screen with that music, and it's a huge buzz. I do have an action figure. For "24," I'm very proud of it. That's one of my greatest achievements. All right, can you get a close-up? Hang on. Remarkably accurate. Can you see the hairline there? This actually has more hair that I do now. I don't want to open it just because, you know, 20 years from now, I have to sell it on eBay. That's so cool. Sometimes I think, you know, "jeez, I did pretty well, you know." They'll say, "jeez, I just... I just really hope you can make it someday, you know." So... but it's not enough. I want to be star. We'd all love to be up there. I mean, any actor who says he don't is lying. It's like, you know, we'd all like to be more successful than where we actually are. You know, I definitely do. One of my favorite scenes ever on film is from "damages," and it partly comes from... I was a series regular for the first time in my life. And the difference between being even recurring and certainly between being... Doing a guest job and being a series regular, there's a huge psychological difference. Guest starring is... it is one of the toughest ways to make a living in this business. You don't know these other actors, you don't know the crew, you don't know the dynamic. And you got to hit there, and it's got to feel like the reg... like, it's got to be absolutely cohesive and it's... It can be really hard. And you're walking in, and you're waiting for the first person to say hello in a friendly way, you know. And the difference between people saying, "hi, I'm so glad you're here," and people saying, "hey." I mean, I've sat in trailers so many times in makeup chairs, and the regulars just pass by. Don't even acknowledge that you're there. If you want to be part of the party, you're in trouble. So what you do is you learn your lines, you hit your marks, and you stay out of everybody's way. You don't get paid, you know, anything like you get paid as a series regular. You do get... something they don't teach... career curves, ups and down. You... you're gonna get them when you get used up. I did 10 televisions in one year, and in the next, I didn't work for 18 months. I think I've been fired twice, which I love actually. I love getting fired. And the way they did it... they were all so mean and weird. But they didn't like what I was doing, so that's cool. You're nobody in this town until you've been fired. And when it happens, I don't care how long I've been working, I will be shattered. I will cry like a little girl. Well, there are times when, you know, I didn't get that job, and they hired that asshole, and it sucks. And I'm glad. And sink. But then lots of times, that's a big hit. So the joke's on me. Maybe they were right. Do I have to answer that? Yeah, and that's the really bad part of me, you know. That's the part that I keep in the corner with the dunce hat on. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean, yeah. He's incredibly honest, yeah. I mean, I am... I'm not competitive. I mean, that's not true. "How did you get that? What did you do to get that?" "I auditioned, I spoke some words, they liked me, and I got it." "Really?" You know, when you go to the movies and see your friends in leading roles and... Or you turn on the TV and, you know, you see your pals, you know, doing some great work, you know, week in and week out, and, you know, you're still waiting for the cell phone to ring, it does kind of hurt. I never felt like someone else's getting something would take away from anything you would ever get. No, I don't agree with Vidal because that's bitchy. He's a good writer, but it's bitchy. Now, if I'm in a series, I wish everybody success. But you know, what happened to the actors too, which is a great thing, this kind of a club, and we see each other in an airport or in a plane or in somewhere. And then... and you fall in, like you had just... like you are all campers, you know. The time... or you were like alcoholics, I think is better. But for instance, I mean just to give you an example, I'm friends with John Slattery, who was in my category in the... Up for the Emmys. Slattery came up to me during the show at one point and, you know, and congratulated me, and he was very sweet about it. And I was kind of tongue-tied because... because I knew how I would feel. In that moment I'd feel like, "well, that's very nice for my friend," but on the other hand, I'd rather be him right now. I-I was more consumed with that when I was young. I... everybody was my competition. It didn't matter. It's a lot of wasted energy. I mean, there are some who are... you know, who are dicks, who are egomaniacs, who are so wrapped up in themselves. I know I'm fairly wrapped up in myself. I had a friend I remember when I was young, and I used to go on and on and on and tell her everything. And then she would say, "I'm good too." And I’d... i had no idea what she meant. The business is so difficult. You'll get that from all of your enemies. Don't take it from your friends, for god's sake. Just be supportive as you can. I sound like I’m, like, really magnanimous. I'm, like, as creepy and as awful as the rest of them. I never thought it was a viable way to make a living. I-I gotta tell you, I still don't think I can make a living doing it. Well, as an actor in the screen actors guild... what is it? 99.4% of the screen actors guild is unemployed on any given day. I mean, the screen actors guild is filled with people who've worked one job and keep paying their dues. The biggest challenge to being an actor is how to get through the, you know, unemployment. The best thing about being an actor is you have a lot of time off. And the worst thing about being an actor is you have a lot of time off. The dry spells are a part of the business. I remember sitting with Henry Fonda. And he said, "well, there's only one job this year, and it's gonna go probably to Stewart." They all... they say in New York that you know you're a successful actor when you can claim your unemployment benefits. That means you have to work, like, 14 weeks. Right. If you can work 14 weeks as an actor, then you get, like, 26 weeks of unemployment. And for a long time, I would design my lifestyle so that I could live on unemployment. Everybody hits their peaks and valleys. And, um, we've had people who were hot, hot, hot. Everybody wanted them at the same time and then perhaps they get on a television show that's not successful. And so what happens is that suddenly they're cold. I'd worked as an actor for several years, and then it just went dry. It's always like... "Okay, next." Aah! There... there's nothing better than... than to be a working actor. There is nothing worse to be a not working actor. I used to write bad checks for pizza. And I would buy, like, two or three pizzas and put them in the refrigerator because I didn't have any cash. I couldn't go to the grocery store. So then I would end up spending half of my next check paying off the... you know, the 20 bucks check for the pizza plus the 20-buck return check fee because it bounced. So I was in bad shape then. The guy said, "I have to read the meter. You owe, like, $9,000 on this apartment." I said, "oh, really?" I said, "where is the meter?" Because the meter was, like, on that tree, and I would go over underneath this thing, down underneath over by there, and there'd be a little trap, which really went to nowhere, and I'd lift it, and I'd say, "it's down in there. But I gotta tell you, there's a lot of vermin down in there." I used the word "vermin." That sounded like someone a little surer, "a lot of vermin down in there." And I lift it up. He said, "oh, fuck it." Then he left. I'm sorry, i-I'll make sure to pay those electrical bills if they're still due." You know, I did the jobs you did, you know, as a waiter or telephone surveys or, you know, all those jobs that you could have off hours. I worked at the door at nightclubs. For four or five years, I was... you know, I worked asphalting, tarring roofs, scaffolding. I had a job for three months in a law firm stapling. I drove a cab. I dealt Blackjack. I got a massage license. I've done contracting. I've been a wine salesman. I've done training. I do all... a wide variety of things to keep food on the table, keep the mortgage paid, keep the kids in the school. I have driven limos, which contained certain people that you would not normally meet during the day. And they would ask for me because I was very well spoken. I never hit on them, and I could make an awful lot of money on a Saturday night. Found this job watering plants in Chicago. You know, I had, like, 2,300 plants on my route. Downtown loop area of Chicago. It gave me the freedom to put my buckets down in the utility closet, which I had the key for in various buildings, and go audition. I met someone. This incredible woman when I was in college, and we got married, you know, five years after I was in acting school. And we just... she made it possible, really, for me. It was really her. She supported me for the first five years of our... of really being in New York and trying to... she was slaving it away. She wanted to be an actress too. She dropped out, and she was working in some corporate offices while I was goofing around onstage. I always like the idea of this vagabond loner guy who kind of didn't want to be committed into one place. I-It's partly selfish, you know, to... selfishness of youth. That kind of lifestyle doesn't lend itself to having a girlfriend, much less a family. I had a dog though with me for the... all of those years. I had a big, white Samoyed named Sam. He was, like, 100 pounds, and he went everywhere with me. You know, as long as I'm in show business, you got someone to scratch your ass. You hear me? But when I met Lisa, my wife, Lisa Giobbi, who was a choreographer... Everything sort of fell into place, and I was... you're right. I was just turning 40. I was 39 years old, and I thought "this... i think it's time for me to be with this person." Well, I was here in L.A. Trying to, you know, do film and television, and I'd already bought a house by then. And I met my wife. She came to rent a room at my house, but it was too expensive for her, so she turned it down. But we ended up going to a party and hooking up anyway. Now, she stays for free. I married a woman who had studied acting, had given it a bit of a go in New York, came out here, went on one too many "Baywatch" auditions and just said, "fuck this shit." I think because you understand each other, you understand the lifestyle you understand what is... You have to go on location... I do get obsessed the minute I get a job. And my wife is wonderful because she says, "okay, he's gone. He's at the Ramada inn even if he's upstairs. He's... he's gone." Because I need that 24-hour focus on that character in that work. I'm very lucky that my wife is 100% behind me. I've spent a lot of time away from home. Yeah, no. My... my wife is a model. And my... my brothers were always very supportive. You know, when I'd be broke and I wouldn't, you know, necessarily even ask them to borrow money but they'd... There would be check in the mail for a few hundred bucks. I'd be like, "oh, thank god. Hey, I made my rent." It helps to have a brother who's a dentist, and you can call up and say, "can you float me a loan?" Which I always paid back, but, I mean, I had a safety net. I did. I'd worked with this one producer, and he used to tell young actors, when they would ask him, he would say... and they would say, "what's the most important thing for a young actor to have?" And he would say, "rich parents." In my mind, it's always about keeping your nut low. I mean, I drive... i drive a 14-year-old Honda accord. You know, my wife and I live like hippies. We have no television. We have no dining room set. We don't eat at a table. People can usually figure out the economics, you know, with way... you know, jobs... temporary jobs or something or borrowing money or, you know, running up their credit cards or something. But it's the mental thing that trips you up. Sometimes I don't deal with it very well, to be honest with you. You know, that's when drugs and alcohol will get involved too, you know, people self-medicate just to survive the day-to-day rejection. I used to, every night... the night would be spent sitting in front of a TV and smoking and having a drink or two until I sought the bed. "Perhaps I'm abusing," is what I thought. I didn't really know, but I thought, "if you're sitting and getting, you know, fucked up every night after... late into the night, is that healthy?" I think it's always a mistake to try to find happiness in your work or to define your happiness through your work. Plant a garden, fall in love, have a pet, have a hobby. I took up martial arts when I was 40. You gotta do something where... where you're interested in it and you're having a good time even if you're not happy. Basketball's been a real good thing for me. You know, it's therapy. Four, two, right? And it made me think that everything we do on the basketball court is kind of related to acting, you know. Like, you learn to commit to whatever move you're making. I think that one of the nice things about acting even though it's a grind, and it's highly competitive, that you have time to be with your family, and you have time to be in your life. We generally skate once... once every month, I guess. At least once a month. I mean, I'd like to get him involved in hockey, which is... I don't want to do hockey. You don't want to do that? I wasn't the yoga guy. Long ago, I was a gym rat, boxing. My wife got into yoga and for years tried to lure me in. She'd say, "oh, you really should come try it. It's really great." And, "no, listen, you do your thing, I'll do mine." I was totally rude about it. And she finally got me when she said, "oh, don't worry, it would just kick your ass anyway." And I never went in the gym again. It's really... it literally changed my life, I mean, from having, like, multiple knee operations, foot operations, things that really hampered my ability to move. I've been, like, pain-free with my knees for years now. The focus it's giving me in terms of acting is amazing. It's made me a calmer person. My wife won't agree, but it's made me a better dad, better husband. I-I do yoga every day. Someone told me once that yoga is natural Viagra. Guys. So, Ian, like I was telling you, in this line of work, you need hobbies because if you're sitting around, waiting for a job, you'll go insane. I'm lucky enough that I work on a show that brings me to the beautiful northwest, except I’m in Canada, b.C., so that's the... What is that? That'd be the southwest. To take advantage of being on a beautiful location and do something really cool like fly-fishing even though I'm not very good at it. Props, props. Props, can we get a fish please? I like to read. I play a lot of musical instruments. From blue to gray to green. The prettiest eyes I've seen. Anytime you're out of work, you're not sure how long that period will be. Well, I know actors who don't work for three years a stint, or two years. I didn't get any auditions for about six months, and I was on unemployment. I had a house, a brand-new baby girl. She was only, like, six or nine months old, and I totally flipped out at that point. How many people in the country have a budget where they don't have to work for six months? I'm pretty good with the dough because when I get it, I keep it, and I know it could be a dry spell for a long period of time. I had friends who were on shows, who were regulars on shows making it, to me, a great paycheck, and they just pissed it all away. I was always cheap, so I saved my money. Because you know, it is a roller coaster ride, and it plummets as high as it climbs sometimes. And especially, as a character actor, you really, you know, the ship doesn't always come in to hold you above water for... For more than a few weeks. I did have a rough patch about, I'll be guessing now, but probably about four or five years in, I didn't work for a year. That was sobering but not... it didn't derail me. It didn't... it didn't make me have to wonder, "oh, my god, what happens when everything comes to a grinding halt?" Right after 9/11, that was one of the hardest times for me. And, uh, I just wasn't getting offered any work. Not only that, I wasn't auditioning a lot. The pain of that started really taking its toll on me. And I fell into just the... I don't know how else to say it, I fell into the abyss. I couldn't sleep. I was smoking like a chimney. I was just drinking a lot. I was depressed. I noticed the bills stacking up. I wasn't able to... to take care of them for the first time really. And I started getting scared, you know, and I had a car note, you know, I had an apartment, I had this, I had that. I said, "well, what am I going to do?" So I said, "well, first thing I'll do is maybe sell everything that I have." And or, you know, just... i need to get all this out of here... Furniture that I have, and so I did that. I sold what I could sell or what people... and I didn't really get anything for it, not as... not as much as I wanted. I had this big, huge TV that was sitting in... in fact, in my living room. And I said... i said, "well, I think I'm going to sell it, but you know what? Instead of selling it, I think I'm going to... I'm going to... I’m going to destroy it." Believe it or not. I went, got out my toolbox and a hammer and a couple of other things, and I began, like, destroying it. I just went up to it and just started beating the shit out of it. And I destroyed... glass everywhere and everything and all across the living room floor, and, like, I killed my TV. I think I was really killing... And this sounds kind of maybe bizarre, I was... it was just symbolic to me of everything I had achieved. But it was... it was betraying me at the time. I wrapped it up in this blanket, and I dragged it. It was heavy, so I dragged it down to the garbage bin downstairs, and I dumped it. So I said, "all right, got rid of that." And the last thing that was really left was my car, you know. And I kept getting phone calls from the auto finance company because I was late on my car. I ended up turning my car in. And there I was again, right where I was from the beginning, back on the bus. I didn't decide to... to, you know, kill myself or anything. I didn't decide to kind of do away with it all, but I said, "well"... i think I thought about it though. You know, I thought about kind of just, "well, maybe it's time for me check out." I remember I was on the Melrose bus, and I got off... i remember I got off and called Donna, and I just broke down. I was... i lost it, you know. And I wasn't mad at her, I was just mad, and you know, I just said to her, you know, "I'm back on the bus again, you know, this wasn't supposed to be like this," you know. And she said, "look, let me call somebody, you know. I know someone at 'general hospital.'" just came at the right time. It came at the right time. So I rode my bike over to the... To "general hospital" set. When you ride a bike to a studio, the security guards look at you like... like you're crazy. "Are you delivering something, or are you on a wrong... do you need... are you lost?" "No, I'm here to go to work." "You're... for what show?" "'General hospital.'" "you're... you're on the show?" "Yeah, I'm on the show." "Okay, you can lock your bike over there by the coke machine," you know. I hope... i hope it doesn't happen again, but if it does, I think I'm better prepared to deal with it, you know, than before. There are more and more actors out of work not be... not necessarily because there are more actors, although I suspect there are. But it's the consolidation of a business. There are just fewer films being made. There's much more reality television. And the pay goes down because they keep paying less, and they say, "hey, they still show up. We pay them less, and they still show up." It is very, very difficult for a character actor to make a living doing film now when you're paid scale ten. So you got to... you got to support a kid and maybe a wife, and you're being paid, I don't know, whatever. 2,750. You know, 2,750 bucks a week, come on. When you were paid 20 years ago, it was, like, 10,000 bucks a week. What's going on? When I first came here, I went off to do a TV movie, I was making 40 grand a week. Now you're lucky to get $6,000, $7,000. And they don't give a fuck who you are or what you've done because they're like, "there's somebody else." You know, it's that whole thing, there's 10,000 guys behind you that will take the job. And sometimes you have to just go, "all right, go fuck yourself then. No, thank you." One of my clients was... was offered a job for an episodic television show, major network. He found out after he booked the job that they only wanted him for a day, that they would need him two days early for prosthetic work because he's shot and killed. Um, and it included a weekend. So he would be getting paid $3,000 before commissions, before taxes to work for five days, and when they said that he also wouldn't get a single card billing, which is something that's pretty important, especially when you're not getting paid well, he held out, and they recast the role. But there's just something sobering about seeing how much this present business does not actually need you. It just needs to fill the slot. And the slot is eminently fill-able with 4 million people in line right behind you. The one-day guest star, they take all your scenes, shoot them in one location, so they only have to work you for a day, a 15-hour day, but it's a day, and they'll go, "well, here's $1,500." I mean, a lot people think that we all make a ton of money, that we all make a load of money. "Oh, you're rich." And, you know, if you're... If you're a guest-starring actor, you... i felt that I was, you know, I think you're more than fortunate if you get one job a month because it takes two weeks to shoot an episode, more or less, so it's like, to get one job a month is... It's great. You can't live on one job a month. When the money comes, it comes, but it doesn't... you know, I suppose to your average American, it looks like a lot because on paper it is. But if you get a big chunk here and then you go two months without, and then you get a big chunk here... many actors have many people involved in their careers. So when someone gets a paycheck, we are allowed to collect 10%. Often, they have a manager who can collect 10% to 15%. They might have an attorney involved as well. Normally they take 5%. So we're talking maybe 25% taken off the top minus whatever taxes you're paying to the government and perhaps a publicist, who also takes a set fee per month. I used to see some checks coming in for clients that they maybe saw 1/4 of what that check was. You don't go into acting for financial security. You go into it because you enjoy it. For me, really deeply fulfilling to get to do what you love to do and get paid for it. But when you're making money, and the gods of Thespis and the world and economy are smiling on you, you think, "I've arrived." You get a TV series, and it's like, you know, you know, it's like backing up into an ATM. It's terrific. Most of us have never made that kind of money before. I never made that kind of money before I got on "prison break." And I didn't even make a lot of money on "prison break" comparatively. I'd been out here. I was 15 grand into a credit card in debt, just paying groceries and rent and stuff. I did a movie, "in the company of men," where I went to Indiana and shot it in 11 days for $24,000. We literally ran out of film. I borrowed money from my brother, so I'm an executive producer on that. And I went from really not being able to get in on pilots, you know, or auditions to, "oh, the guy from that." A friend of mine has a furniture moving company, he's like, "fuck, I'll give you 70 bucks a day or something like that." I was like, "all right." I would schlep furniture into rich people's houses. And the next day, literally, I got "Xena." Two days later, I'm in new Zealand, and that was sort of the beginning of the role. It came the day after I went, "all right. Manual labor. Here's my pride, take it. I need a paycheck." What I have achieved is an enormous success that, if I were a lawyer, I may not be f. Lee Bailey, but I could be a really successful lawyer, and everyone doesn't have to necessarily know my name. If we were in any other field, there would be no doubt about it. It's just that because Hollywood has this self-adoration thing that we only revere that top 0.10% that we forget there's a whole community of solid working professionals who also help to keep this industry together. And I think I'm one of them. It's like when you go to acting school, they're only... the only roles they ever give you to work on are the starring roles in the most dramatic emotional scenes among those in that play. Nobody ever gives... nobody ever seems to go to work on, how do you help tell the story? What's this character do to help tell the story? You know, I didn't think I was leading man material. I didn't think I was romantic lead material, but I thought there were plenty of parts that were interesting out there for me. I don't... I'm not a, you know, handsome guy, and I'm not a, you know, I don't have... I’m a journeyman actor. I'm a character guy. And, you know, probably I’m never going to, you know, have a big movie career or you know, get the lead on some big TV show. It's just not who I am. You do this kind of work because you love it. But to be honest, it's what I do. It's what I said I was going to do since I was a kid. Nothing ever happened that was so devastating that made me say, "screw this." If you give up, then I've given up not only for me but for all those other, you know, poor kids who look like me and haven't... haven't come here yet. You know, people I've... some of the best letters I've received fan mail-wise are from kids in... all over the country who say, "you know, Mr. Worthy, I'm 8 years old. I'm 9 years old. I'm 12 years old. I just saw you on so and so's show. One day I would love to be an actor like you," you know. And to me, that means more than what any critic could write about anything I've ever done because it means I've affected... Reached... connected with some kid who has dreams. I have a line that I often thought would be perfect when I get some award someday, which would be, "I'd like to thank all the people who said no. You made me try so much harder." If I got out of business tomorrow, everything I've... I've tried to accomplish, I've done. I'm a little kid. Every time I go to the movies, I get my popcorn, and I get my m&ms, and I dump the m&ms on the popcorn, and then shake 'em up. Well, I wish I had a little bungalow out in L.A., and I could make a living doing, you know, pop-ups on TV shows and occasionally be in a great movie. Oh, that's what I have. It's fantastic, and I laugh my ass off all day long, so much so that I'm afraid I’m gonna get fired. If I had to pick a category, that's what I would've picked in the first place 'cause that was going to have the best shot of seeing you through a life. I have a great family life and a lot of time to myself to do whatever I want and be with my family, and then I get to work every once in a while. I'm lucky. I'm 75 sitting here, and I’m still alive. And working. I was working yesterday morning. This is what I do pretty well, and I only have so many... So much time on the planet, my job is to give it away. I don't need a big ego. And actually it doesn't help me. I think maybe if it helped me, if I needed it, I could... i could find one. In the morning, you're an optimist. In the afternoon, you're a pessimist. In the evening, you know, you get some sundown syndrome, and you're a really dark character, but in the morning, you wake up, and you're the optimist again, you know. When acting is going well, it's certainly a buzz, man. It's a... it's a rush, you know, if it's going well. Often it's not but... then, you know, you're in hell. You can play the villain. You can play the victim. You can play the doctor, the lawyer, the Indian chief. You don't have to carry a picture, and you can raise a family in this town. I always wanted to emulate Moliere because he died onstage. That happened to me, it would be perfect. I hope I tell a really good joke and then die. It's just now coming to me that, "yeah, this is something that I've done my whole life, 40 years almost now, coming up on." Just... i don't even want to think about anything. I just go and be that guy. Hey, man. Good to see you.
