So, there I am. Down on one knee in the sand, almost exactly where I had been seven years before, kissing her. Waves crashing in the background, the sun glistening into her strikingly beautiful green eyes. And I'm holding up a diamond ring, asking her to marry me, which I'd saved up for for three fucking years, by the way. After 15 minutes of pouring my soul out, telling her how wonderful she is and how wonderful our lives now make sense and how... and how... and how... and how... and how our future is nothing but a big shiny, bright spot. I mean, what would you say? You'd say something? But, no, no, no. Nothing. Like, nothing at all. Like, just crickets. And then tears. Tears streaming down my face, but these are not tears of joy. No. These are not tears of, "Oh, my God, now our lives make sense together and we're gonna have four kids and we're gonna live in Seattle." No. These are, "How about I open up your chest, I take a big fat fucking shit inside of it, I zip it up, I wrap you up in duct tape, I put you on a chair, I put a noose around your neck, and then I kick the chair out from underneath you" tears. Because, you know what? She goes, "I met someone new. I met someone with a little more stability," she said. She goes, "How are you gonna take care of me when I'm pregnant?" Um, what was the rent for the room again? Oh, right. Right, right. So, basically it's a thousand bucks, flat out. Okay, uh, that's actually not too bad. I'm gonna pass. Great. Okay. Great. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go. Oh, of course you're gonna pass, you fucking soul-sucking-Shiva of a whore! Why don't you just go ahead and nut tap poor ol' Greg's testes and rip out his uvula while you're at it! Get in line, you fucking blonde cracker! Hey, Ms. Dalton. It's good to see you this morning. Hey! Love that new landscape! Killer perennials. Once upon a time, a poor aspiring writer named Greg was drowning in heartbreak. The love of his life, Ashley, had just fucked the shit out of their couples therapist, Dr. Wilbon. This begins the sad, sad tale of a hopeless love addict trying to find love once again. And along the way, a roommate, too. Greg, it's your sister. Wake up. Oh. There it is. Argh. Oh, God, it's you. Mom said you still can't find a roommate? Yeah, not yet. I'm being selective. Yeah. Oh, hey, by the way, Greg. Dan and I are having a little dinner party on Saturday and I really think you should come. Mm, I don't know. I'm kind of on the fence about human beings right now. Oh, speaking of human beings, please do not miss your 3:00 p.m. workout with my trainer, Hector. Oh, fuck me real hard. Jules, I thought we rescheduled that. No, we didn't reschedule that. You need the endorphins. Oh, God damn it, Jules. No, I don't need endorphins. I'm fine. You're a mess, Greg. And you should stop... just stop drinking that, unless you want to puke your nuts out at your session. Please. Pfft, how hard could this Hector guy's workout possibly be? I want 20 push-ups, soldier. Oh, my God. Soldier? Think I am... think I'm... Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Get off my squad. I'm sorry? Get off my squadron right now. Your squad? I don't want no pansy-ass mama's boy on my squadron. Get the fuck up. I'm not a love addict. No. It's totally normal to get emotional during a romantic comedy. Mom, how am I supposed to get a job and a roommate and work on my writing? Hmm? You think Dalton Trumbo was posting craigslist ads and driving around in an Uber on the weekends? No. Yes, writing is going great. All right, say hello to Mary Jane for me. Love you, too. Bye. I'm sleeping with our couples therapist. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Fuck. Fuck you, Dr. Wilbon! So, you had the same recurring dream last night. Yes. Doctors are the worst. How did that dream make you feel when you woke up? Oh, pfft, just wonderful. I mean, I love the fact that the love of my life is fucking our couples therapist. You're still in anger phase. That will subside. And, Greg, you know this dream isn't real. Well, yeah, but her fucking Dr. Wilbon is very real. True, that does suck very badly. Is that supposed to be helpful? Moving right along. How about you, Doc? Have you ever fucked a client? I would never sleep with a beautiful, sensual, buttery thighs, breasts that could dent a man's chest, vivacious valley, dimple on her ass... Doc? Yes? Oh, I'm sorry. Very sorry. You were saying? Yeah, the banging of a client. Oh, right, right. Enough about me. How are you doing, in general? I don't know. I mean... It's a roller coaster of emotions. You know, some good days, some bad days. Actually, mostly bad days. Actually, mostly awful days, like God-awful days. Like curl-up-in-a-ball and fall-down-a-deep-dark-well, shatter-your-spinal-cord- on-impact- and-drown-in-six-inches-of-water awful days. Let me ask you something, Greg. Have you been working out lately, done any sort of physical activity? Oh, God, you don't even want to know. You know, Greg, physical exercise is a necessary catalyst in the releasing of endorphins. What the fuck is it with these goddamn endorphins? Fuck! Fuck you! I hate endorphins! I never wanted to fucking have them in the first place! Fuck them. I'm fine. Odd yet interesting trigger point of anxiety. How about male companionship? Have you taken time to hang out with any of your broheims lately, since your breakup with Ashley? No, I haven't. Well, then, I suggest you make time for your homies. Remember, Gregory, don't be a wussy because of the pussy. This is the good life, my friend. Who woulda thought a couple of young kids from Upstate New York would come out west and absolutely crush it like we have? Currently unemployed, and you're a professional male house sitter mooching off celebrities. Living the dream. Oh, God. So, what's going on with you, man? You found your new roommate yet? No, not yet. I can't get out of that two-year lease. Damn, dude. How long you been lookin' for? It's been 57 days since Ashley moved out. Jesus H. What the hell's taking so long? I put an ad out on craigslist, by the next week, I had already kicked out a new roommate. - Why'd you kick 'em out? - I caught him face-fucking that gothic gargoyle statue in the foyer area. You know, the marble one? Oh, yeah. Very nice piece. Thank you. I got this new guy, he's been lickin' the bathroom mirrors. Good God. Where you finding these guys, OKCupid? Don't worry about it. So, what's the problem? How come you can't find a roommate? I don't know, I just... I haven't found the right match, I guess. Oh, Christ. What are you doing? I'm going to give you some sorely needed roommate-seeking advice. That's simply not necessary, thank you. Oh, it most certainly is. Now, for starters, rule number one. So, no matter what, no matter if Felicia "Vike-ander" from "Ex-Machine-a"... Alicia Vikander. Alicia Vikander from Ex-Machina. No matter if Felicia "Vike-ander" from "Ex-Machine-a" shows up... No! Alicia Vikander. If Felicia "Vike-ander"... Alicia Vikander from Ex-Machina. - If Felicia... - It's not Felicia, it's Alicia Vikander from... If Alicia from The Danish Girl... Okay. ...shows up at your front doorstep, no matter what, looking for a place to live, no matter what, under absolutely no circumstances whatsoever can you have a female roommate. Why the hell not? Because you just got your heart trampled on really fucking hard, Greg, really fucking hard, and because of that, you probably got some latent anger very deep inside that cold, bitter heart of yours, toward the female species. - That's just simply not true. - Is that so? I thoroughly enjoy the company of a fine female. I was raised by two of them, for Christ's sake. - Is that so? - Yes. Because I ran into Mrs. Dalton this week while she was landscaping her front yard, and she told me that one of the neighbors called the cops on you because you were screaming at some poor girl, calling her, and I quote, "a fucking blonde cracker." End quote. Mrs. D told you about that, huh? Yeah, she did, Greg. Hey, what'd you think of her new perennials? They are quite lovely. - Aren't they? - Yes, very much so. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's the mulch. I mean, she's the only one crushing it in this drought. Yeah. Her bed is flush as shit. Oh, it is. You're fucking her, aren't you? I am indeed. Come on. You're fucking her. - Come on. - Are you fucking her? - Let's go. - Oh, my God. I am. I am. All right, I am going to be your potential roommate. You are going to be you. Unfortunately, that's an element that we can't really change here, but that's okay. We'll find a work-around. I can't do this. This is so stupid. Do you like paying full rent - and all the bills, Greg? - Oh, God. Yo, what's up, dawg? - Really, Greg? - What? What are you, like, a 35-year-old Justin Bieber? - What? What'd I say? - "Yo, what's up, dawg"? Out of all the ways that you could possibly greet somebody, that's what you go with? What's wrong with that? That's how I talk to dudes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hello there, fine gentleman. All right, now you seem like you just want to sodomize me. Well, fuck, dude. What do you want me to say? How about more nice, normal guy? Less creepy Jared-from-Subway guy. Yes, less creepy, Subway, got it. All right. Howdy, partner, it's nice to meet ya. What? Greg knew Paul was right. He headed off to his sister's party hoping to find a male roommate. But she and her boyfriend, Dan, who has been acting a little fucking weird ever since suffering a serious head injury while skiing, had other plans. No, no, the Bosu ball is great for the bedroom. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, hey. Hector. It's a pleasure to... what a surprise. Oh, you shaved your head, man. That is... soldier style, huh? Nice. Well, it's good to see you, man. Those pecs are firm. You not on my squad. Well, that wasn't awkward. Well, I threw up all over his shoes. - I heard. - Like, all over 'em. - Laces and everything. - I heard that, too. Oh, I brought you something. Oh, wow, Greg. You shouldn't have. I don't even know why I bought that Opus One - when we have this. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Gregorino. Hey, man, thank you so much for coming. - This is cool. - Yeah. Dan, he's... he's depressed. He's not a deaf foster child. - Okay. - Jules, I'm not depressed. Oh, you know what I mean. Look at this. Greg bought us this box of, I think... This is outstanding. We love it. It's good. Have you tried it? Mm, God, yeah. We have it all the time. - It's our favorite. - Love it. Wait, I thought you said you haven't had it. Anyways, this is hot. So, where is everybody. Am I early? Oh, yeah, um, so, we sent out the invitations, but they had the wrong date on it. For everybody, except for you. And me! And Wenona! Hey, you guys haven't met, have you? Uh, no, Jules. Matter of fact, I don't think we have. - Fun. - Fun. Come on over, Wenona. Just make yourself at home. Okay. Okay! Yeah, we should open up this box. I like that shirt. I love gray. - Uh, thanks - Yeah. Here we go. This is cool. So, Greg, what do you do for a living? Well, sis, it's an interesting question. Thanks for asking. Especially since I'm unemployed. Oh, shit. I forgot about that. Well, what did you used to do? Um, I was a production assistant, but that was just to pay the bills. I really want to, um... I want to write. Or I am a writer. Or I will be. Hopefully, one day. That's really rad, dude. Where were you a production assistant? It was a, uh, The Trailer House. Oh, my God. That is so sweet. Trailer people need love just as much as people with real houses. It was a movie trailer house. Oh! Oh, of course. That makes so much more sense. Right. Yeah, because you wouldn't want to be surrounded by trailer people all the time 'cause they smell weird. Ish. Well, that's really great because I loooovvve movie trailers! Cool. Well, what about you, Wenona? Let's hear what's going on with you since you left our accounting firm last year. Well, I'm actually kind of in limbo, but if this lawsuit works out, I'm thinking of doing some serious traveling. You have a lawsuit? Yup, a, uh... a sexual harassment lawsuit. - Oh, my God. What happened? - Oh, Jesus. Well, Dan and I fucked. No. No, that's not true. That's not true. I wouldn't touch her dirty ass with your dick. Dan from work. - Oh. - Whoa. Yeah. Yeah, Dan from work, maybe. That's cleared up. You like that? Let me get this straight. You fucked Dan? Dan, Dan? As in our boss, Dan? Yep, during my exit interview. - Oh, my God. - It was pretty intense. That guy is a freak. I thought maybe I would get to keep my job if I let him stick it in-in, but apparently not. But double-but, my attorney thinks I have a pretty darn good shot with this lawsuit, so, fingers crossed. I mean, that would be the dream. Yeah. - Yay. - Kudos. This can't be real. Oh, hey, you guys should go out, the two of you. Dan! I promise not to sue. Well, the chicken's pretty good, huh? Yeah. I've actually never seen her quite like that before. And, plus, all my other friends are either married or in rehab or there's actually a few on Ashley Madison, so... Well, look, I'm not exactly looking to date any time soon, despite Dan's brilliant suggestion. Well, you know he hasn't been himself since the skiing accident. This is a stew. That is a chicken. - Oh, fuck my butt. - What? I think I just got an email about the apartment. - What's it say? - "Hey, duder! Is this room still avail? I am moving to the City of Angels tomorrow and desperately need a place to reside. If it is, is it cool if I PayPal you the money now for the first month's rent and swing by and move in tomorrow?" The fuck? "I promise not to be a serial killer" dot-dot-dot..."anymore. JK. Kinda. But for realz. Let me know! Thanks, man." Smiley face. Peyton. Hmm. Sounds a little desperate, perhaps too good to be true, but you know what? Fuck it. I say go for it. I don't know, you think? Yeah, totally. Just don't puke on the guy this time. Yeah, very funny. All right, I gotta go. Love you, bye. Good-bye. A hundred and 183 dollars? What the fuck? God damn it. No! I'm fucked! I'm so fucked. No! I just got a roommate, though. Yes, I did. I just got a fuckin' roommate. Fuck yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you Greg? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Peyton. Hi. Oh, my God. You're Peyton. Yeah, the... the serial killer. I'm not a serial killer. The former serial killer. - Right. - Remember? Yeah. Right, yeah, no. Right, of course. - Right. - No, that's right. I mean, who is? You know? Um, no, I just... I thought that Peyton was a boy's name. - No offense. - Oh, no, none taken. Yeah, are you a Broncos fan? No, I fuckin' hate them, actually. Oh. Well, I was gonna say the Broncos, Peyton Manning. Uh, random. No, because people think Peyton Manning and then they think Peyton, that I'm a guy. Oh, yes, right. But, nah, these are... these are breasts. Yeah. And I have a functioning vagina as well. Ah! Gynecologist says top notch. Looks good. Is that okay, that I'm a... a woman? No matter what, under absolutely no circumstances whatsoever can you have a female roommate! No, yeah, it's great. Come on in. - Really? Oh. - Yes. I'm very happy. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. You have great hair. - Sorry. - Oh. - It's sticky. - Oh. - Oh, wow. - So, yeah, this is your room. This is... this is perfect. Yeah. This is very purple. Yep. I love it, though. I call it the purple monster. Well, I like it. - It's my favorite color. - Oh. A mixture of red and blue. Oh. Are you gay? - No. Are you? - Oh. No. Great. Yeah. Cool. It's ex... it's really exactly what I need. - So... - Okay. Big closet. Yep, you could fit a lot in there. Yes, yes. So, uh, is there anything else that you... that you might need? Uh, other than an 8 ball and a good fisting, I think I'm good. I'm sorry, come again? I'm just fucking with you, Greg. - Oh, right. - I'm sorry. - No, no. - Demented sense of humor. - Not at all. - Freaks people out. No, it didn't really freak me out. I was actually pretty centered with it. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. I've never been fisted. I've never done cocaine. Cool. This is nice. Right, so, um, do you have any... uh, you have a box... do you have anything in your car, or boxes or...? Yeah, but I'll just... I'll deal with it later. - Yeah, okay. All right. - Yeah. Well, um, let me know if you need any help, uh, loading it... loading it in. - Aw, thanks. Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. Uh, the door... these o... these doors open. And, uh, mahalo. Yeah. Oh, this... actually this, um... this is a painting that was done by my grandfather. - He served in World War II. - Oh. And he was also a really huge aficionado of Hungarian art. - And, um... - Hungarian art? Yeah, and this is actually Budapest. And, um, he fell in love with... with Hungary. - But this is Florence. - This is Budapest, actually. - But it says Florence. - He would tell the stories... No, this is the name of the painting. It's Firenze. It's actually "fire." It means "fire" in Hungarian. "Firenze" means "Florence" in Italian. And I lived over here in Florence. This is the Duomo. This is the Arno. It's definitely Budapest. And this is actually the Budapest river. Okay. Yeah. Fist bump. What? Now you've been fisted. Holy cow. Am I right? Greg not only found a roommate, but he might have just manifested the real girl of his dreams. Of all the girls he has fallen way too hard for, he has never experienced love at first sight quite like this. He was sure Paul would be happy for him. So, uh, I got a new roommate. Mm. - You did? - Yeah. I have to say, I think I'm in love. Listen, Greg. Oh, fuck. I get that you're angry at women, okay? Understandably so. I mean, Ash completely steamrolled over your nuts. Like totally obliviated any trace of manhood - that you once had. - Paul, I got it. She pretty much ripped your dick in half and stuck it - in between your legs. - Paul! I got it. - But switching teams, Greg? - No! Come on, man. That's a little dramatic. I mean, I... I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it. You know, I guess. Change and everything. Huh. It's a girl. A disarmingly cute and attractive girl. Fuck! Fucking son of a bitch! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, Greg! Come on, man. Come the fuck on! - Jesus. - Fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Greg. That was a little bit uncalled for. I understand that. It's just that you just fuckin'... you rile me up, man. You just... You rile me up like no other. God. I can see that. What did I tell you about a girl roommate? Well, I didn't know it was a girl. What the fuck does that even mean? Her name was Peyton. Oh. Like Peyton Manning? Yes! Therefore I thought it was a dude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can understand that. I can see that. I woulda thought the same thing, actually, Yeah. Come on, man. You're smarter than this. Look at what happened with Ash. Oh, God. Enough with Ashley, okay? Her and Dr. Wilbon and I, we had a very mature, adult conversation. We talked everything out. We achieved some very nice closure. Wh... what are you doing, Greg? I'm getting closure! How you like them apples, motherfucker? A-are you serious? Come on. That's actually pretty good. What brand is it? All right, are we done here now? No! Anything breakable here? Ah! Greg, no, Greg. Come on, don't. No! Don't! Greg! Those are the remains of a human being. Aren't they? Two, actually. My mother and my father. Really? Yeah. Then I am very impressed, Greg. Thank you. And Peyton is great. She's really fucking great. It was like love at first sight, I'm telling you. Aw, come on with that bullshit. That never happens. It's just a rebound, Greg. It's probably the first girl that you've seen in, like, over a month. Of course you're gonna think you're in love with her. Are you stupid or something? Listen, this is what you do. You take her out to Indian food. You get her the curry, you get her the roti, the works. You put a little laxative in her drink when she goes to the bathroom. Then you go to one of those new escape room things. Boom, that'll set you fucking straight with this "in love" bullshit. I don't know. Maybe you're right. 'Course I'm right. Now don't just sit there. Toss me one of those brewskis, will ya? Come into my domicile, two twelve packs of beers, you don't even offer me one. What are you, a fucking savage or something? You shook it up. Come on, put it back, Greg. Get me a good one. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, hey. Oh, no worries. Just getting my yoga on. It's not like I'm doing naked yoga or anything. Would you? Oh, have you ever tried this shit? It's a total trip. Uh, you know, no. I... I'm not... I'm not a big yoga... yoga-er. You should try it sometime. Releases a lot of endorphins. I'll probably pass because back in high school there was this guy named Jimmy Knox, and after gym class he would bend me over, but backwards and then forwards, and he broke my rib. And he said, "I bet now that you have a broken rib, you can suck your own dick." Oh, my God. What a jerk. I know. C-could you do it? Actually, yeah. I mean, not that I ever did. No, no. Of course not. Fuck me. What... what'd you say? Um, I said, "My God, this is a good day." Hmm, I don't think I'm gonna do anymore yoga. Do you want a smoothie? Yes, I would love one. Wow, this looks super healthy. Yeah, I know, right? I don't know if my Midwest body's gonna be able to handle it. Might have a shit-right- through-my-yoga-pants situation on my hands. Yeah, I know exactly what you are talking about. I have a shit-through-my-pants situation with about everything I eat. Oh. Yeah. I have a leaky stomach. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. So, where'd you say you were from again? - Chi-town? - Ah, makes sense. Why do you say that? You're just so open and generous. That's really sweet. Thanks. Um, yeah, my friends back home are pretty awesome. So, what brought you, uh... what brought you all the way out here? The porn industry. - Really? - Yeah. - I want to get into porn. - Oh. I tried the whole nine-to-five thing and it's just... it's not for me. - Right. - Plus, there's loads - of money in it. - Right. Like, loads. Right. Do you like porn, Greg? You know... ...that's an interesting question. Um, you know, there's... I'm quite... there's a... I have... You know, my mom always used to say that when I choose to express myself, uh, in an intimate way, uh, objectifying women is not something that... Uh, my... I-I've heard of it. - You've heard of it? - Yeah. Oh, my God, dude, I'm fucking with you. - Really - Yes. Oh, Jesus, well, I didn't know what to say. - Oh, my God. - So, wait, are you in... No, I'm going to UCLA grad school for journalism next week. Completely different answer from the first. - Totally different. - Yeah. Yeah, I've always been interested in telling stories grounded in truth, so journalism, and I figure if that doesn't work out, then I can just transition into documentary filmmaking, you know. - Yeah, anything. - Or porn. You know? Always got porn as a fall back. That's what my mother said. She did. Okay, so, let's give it a whirl. I want to make sure it's really smooth. They don't call it a chunky. I'm going for a smooth move smoothie. That's so cute. All right, I think we're done. All right. Here goes nothin'. Okay, to juice cleanses, pornos, and our rapidly approaching and inevitably powerful bowel movements. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hmm, it's not bad. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's good. Okay, well, I have an alarmingly significant amount of swamp ass happening in my pants right now, so I'm gonna get out of my sweaty clothes and into the shower. Yeah, okay, sounds good. Greg, what in heavens are you doing here? Emergency sesh, Doc. - Now, just wait a minute. - Emergency sesh, STAT. Wenona? Oh, um, hey, Greg. Fancy seeing you here. You never called me back. What is wrong with you? Are you afraid of a little adventure? Look, I got your nose. Let's be friends. Great sesh, Dr. Naik. Same time next week? Yes, yes. That works splendidly. Ta-ta, boys. Behave. Oh. Are you fucking her? Of course not. She's just a client. You know what? You doctors just can't keep it in your pants, can you? Moving right along. Enough about me. Let's focus on you. So, what's this emergency you have? I'm in love. It's my roommate. She lives in my apartment and I'm in love with her and I've barely even seen her or spoken to her. It's like... She can't be real. It's like she's too good to be true. What the hell do I do? This is what I suggest, Greg. Life is short. The wise and doctor thing for me to do is to advise you to forget about her completely. Admit that you have a love addition problem that needs immediate attention and aggressive rehabilitation. Well, I say, if you really like this girl, go for it, because, fuck it. What's the worst that could possibly happen? She turns you down. Big fucking whoop, Gregory. Her turning you down doesn't hold a candle to your ex-girlfriend fucking your couples therapist. Wow. That's very honest. Go for it, Greg, because if you don't, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I can do this. I think I can. And I think this is exactly what I needed to hear. More or less. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, let's do this. Right? So, do you think I should just go for it? I personally think it's great. - Yeah? You think? - Yes. That's why I was trying to set you up with Wenona in the first place, because you need to finally move on from Ashley. Whom, by the way, is sleeping with Dr. Naik. Jesus, really? How many therapists is that chick gonna take down? No, not Ashley. Wenona. Oh, well, makes sense. So, what should I do? I've never really tried to pick up a roommate before. You know, come to think of it, the only two people I've ever tried to swoon were Lauren and Ashley. Are those the only two people you've ever had sex with? No. Almost. I mean, think about it. I was with Lauren for seven years. I was with Ashley for five. God, that sounds so depressing. Thanks, Jules, thanks. What should my angle be? I don't know what that means. My angle, my game plan, my approach. How do I get Peyton to fall madly in love with me? - Like, ASAP? - All right, let me think. No, I don't have anything. Really? Nothing? Yeah, I... I never really had a problem getting guys. It was just never an issue for me. That's 'cause you're a girl. Maybe I should talk to Paul about this. Hey, maybe you just need to start being yourself. Yeah, really? You think that would really work? Totally. You don't think that's a disastrous plan that would just blow up in my face? Mm-mm. It'd be good. I mean, all right. I might... I can do that. Yeah, yeah, you can do that. You get out there and do it, kid, because you are the... Gregorino, welcome back! You look like $100,000! Man, you are aces, and I love you in this home, man. Let us just have fun together. Huh? I gotta go. Yah! Okay. Mm, what are you cooking? That smells delicious. Oh, it's just a little... little dish I whipped up on the fly, little spur-of-the-moment thing. No big deal. Wow, I never knew you cooked. Yeah, I do lots of really awesome stuff. Oh, uh, you know what? I actually made enough for two, and I got some wine, too. That sounds awesome, but Jack and I are going to dinner. Yeah, bro. We're hitting up Bestia. You ever been? It's actually the hardest reservation in town to get, but I just dropped a name or two from my rolodex-o and... Yeah, voila! A table magically opened up. Well, it wasn't really magic, I-I basically did that! 8:00 p.m. reservation, right up front, day of, no less. Nonetheless. Wow. That's... really impressive. Yeah, I know. We were gonna Uber Select, but, uh, I figured I'd take my new Tezzy for a spin. All right, wow. That sounds... mm. Do you want... do you want to come with us? No, I... it's totally cool. I... I have... I made dinner. Just a little thing. It's called bún thit xào. It's a Vietnamese pork shoulder over vermicelli noodles with a supple demi-glaze. - Wow. - So good. Okay. That sounds really good. I have a knack for Southeast Asian cuisine. Okay. So, yeah, I'm gonna make dinner and maybe get into some boxed wine and watch some Kardashians. That sounds fun. Wow, livin' the dream. All right, well, enjoy dinner. I'll... I'll see you later. I'll see you when I get home. - Okay. - 'Kay. Enjoy those Kardashians, bro. Thanks, man. - Is he gay? - I don't know. Shh. - I don't know. - He's a tremendously good cook and he, like, watches the E exclamation channel. And just like that, Greg's life sucked ass once again. He couldn't believe his bad luck. All he wanted to do was run after that Tezzy driving sack of shit with his bún thit xào knife and stab him to death with it so that he could be with Peyton. But he decided to let cooler heads prevail and go see Paul instead. Dude, you just got to nut up. Every girl has got Greggy-poo's head spinning. What are you talking about? No, they don't. Uh, in high school, there was that chick with the one hand who had the different sized titties. What, you're talking about Debra? No, no, she did not have my head spinning. Agree to disagree, Greg. - Treat? - Yeah. Mm. What about Lauren? Oh, come on, Lauren didn't have my head spinning. You had to take a six-month leave of absence from work for severe depression and anxiety when she dumped you. Yeah, well, it was just a phase I was going through. What about the rest of those girls you obsessed about after they rejected you before you finally landed Ash, that fuckin' winner? You know what? I did not obsess over all those girls. Bro, three out of four of them defriended you on Facebook. I was gonna defriend them first. They just... they beat me to the punch. All I'm saying is be careful, Greg. Look, I am, okay? I get it. Paul, man. Great hang today, huh, brother? Mm! Who's that? Fuck do I know? Hi, oh, I'm sorry. - I... - Oh. Oh. I thought I was the only one here. No, it's okay. I'll leave. No, no, no, no. Would you stay? I'd like it if you'd stay. Okay. I'm not gonna bite you. Is everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine. How was dinner? Awful. I'm sorry to hear that. Guy was a fucking taint. Yeah, well, he didn't really make the greatest first impression. All he wanted to do was have sex with me. I'm sorry, Peyton. Why are all guys such slimy dick holes? Well, not all guys are slimy dick holes. Some are really, really, really great. All he did was talk about himself and how much money he has, and blah-dee-fuckity- blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, and then when I didn't invite him in, he called me a prude bitch and he drove away in his Tezzy. Tezzy? Really? Fucking douchebag. What a clit face. Mm. What about you, Greg, are you in a relationship? No, I am totally single. Completely available. Good. 'Cause relationships suck. My last relationship, we lived together for three years, and then I find out that my best friend has been fucking him for two of the three years. And how do I find out? I find out because they asked me if I wanted to be in a threesome with them. - Oh, my God. - I know! - Oh, my God. - Yeah. I am so sorry. I know exactly how that feels. No, you do? It's so fucked up. By both of them. I found out a month before I came out here. It's actually what made me pull the trigger. Well, I mean, as awful a situation as that is, I... I'm really sorry that happened to you. You know, at least it convinced you to come out here. Yeah. Hey, would it be, um, totally inappropriate - if we spooned? - Fuck, no. Okay. I want to be the little one. I'd like to do it right now. Me, too. Ooh. Ooh-kay. Ooh-kay. Yeah. Yeah, that's a tad overzealous. It feels right to me. Mm, I'm actually having trouble breathing. There we go, okay. That's good. Good night, Greg. Good night, Peyton. I can feel your dick. Come in. Well, would you look at this. The man was paralyzed with anxiety and depression, and now he's transformed himself into a whistling Dixie right before our very eyes. Morning, Doc. You got some ass, didn't you? Nope, even better. Cuddling. Cuddling? Yeah. Total cuddle sesh. - Cuddle sesh with whom? - My roommate. Ah, yes. The roommate. Oh, wow. Good for you, sailor. Give it a few more months and maybe you can grab a tit or two. That's the thing, I don't even care about the sexual part. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, look, of course, she's smoking hot, so getting a nice blowy or two from her or making some sweet love would certainly be nice. What about in the bum? Am I actually paying you for these sessions? Moving right along, let's continue. No, that's the different thing about her, is I don't care about that part. It's like, I don't know, I just wanna be... I don't know, I just want to be near her. You know? It's like we have this crazy soul connection. I don't know. I can't describe it. Well, that's terrific, Greg. I'm very happy for you. Thanks, Doc. I feel like a new man. I must warn you, though. This could be a natural high of sorts. Given with your love addiction and all, sometimes the mind creates a fictional experience, a false high, similar to feelings of being lost and emptiness during depression. I don't want you to get too high and then crash and then take a step backwards. You know, I... I wouldn't worry. I think I've really turned a corner here, Doc. But I have to say, those were some impressive words of wisdom. You actually sound like a real doctor. - Well, thanks, Greg. - Yeah. You know what? I'll catch you later. We have 55 minutes left in our session. I don't think I need 'em. I feel great. Plus, I gotta take a shit. See you later, Doc. Aw, shit. What's up, my girl? Well, you seem to be in a better mood today. Well, I am. I think I'm starting to feel - like my old self again. - Oh, that's terrific. How's the new roommate? Julie told me all about her. Mom, she's amazing. Like, I'm not kidding. I think she's like relationship-worthy amazing. - Oh, boy. - Oh, boy, what? Just be careful not to rush things. When something seems too good to be true, it often is. Why's everybody keep saying that to me? And I love your optimism, by the way. - You sound just like Dad. - Well, I'm just saying. I don't want to see you get hurt again. Well, son of a sailor, Mom. Way to take the wind right out of my sails. Well, I don't mean to. I'm just trying to keep you from getting hurt, to protect you, jeez. Yeah, yeah. Greg! Mom, I gotta go. That's Jules. Okay, say hi to Jules for me. I will. And, hey, look. You are a dirty-ass sailor, but, God damn it, I love you. I love you, too, baby. Bye-bye. Hey, Jules, I'm in here. Oh, Jesus Christ, Greg. It smells like Grandpa when he had his colonoscopy. Sorry. I had a pork shoulder with vermicelli noodles with a supple demi-glaze last night. Best TV dinner I've ever had. Oh, man, that is just rank, Greg. It's like a thick, misty... just thick. It's just really thick. Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, is she here? And are you sure that you want to subject her to, you know, like, our family bowel problems? No, of course not, but she's not here. - She must be in class. - Class? Please tell me you're not robbing the cradle. Grad school, Jules. Grad school. Thank God. Phew. Who is that? I think it's for me. I'm gonna be back in a second. Who is that? Who the fuck is that? Shut the door! Don't leave me like this! God damn it. Spell my name, boy. One! Spell my name out loud. Okay. H-E-C-T-O-R. That's right. Do it again. H-E-C-T-O-R. That's right. Do it again! Once more! Whoo! H-E-C-T-O-R. Yeah! Don't you forget, motherfucker. - One more time. - H-E-C-T-O-R. That's what I'm talking about. H-E-C-T-O-R. H-E-C-T-O-R. H-E-C-T-O-R. Whoo! All right, baby girl. Good to see you. Have you a good day. Mm, you, too, Hector. I will see you tomorrow. Can't wait. All right. Great workout. Not bad, pussy boy. Not bad at all. You might have a soldier in there after all. - Thank you, sir. - Spell my name. H-E-C-T-O-R. All right, then. See? Right? He's not so bad. What are you talking about? He's a psycho. Oh, you're so dramatic. And, you know what? If you stop being so negative and keep it up, I think you have a really good chance of getting back on his squad. His squad? What does that even mean? I don't know what it means, but I know you want to be on it. All right, listen, I gotta run. But, wait, I thought you had to talk to me about something. Nope. I was just trying to trick you into exercising, which worked, so you could get those endorphins. Oh, my God, you are the worst! - Ow. - Sorry. But I love you, Greg. So be good. I love you, too. Okay, well, feel better. And stop being crazy, okay? Okay. - Hey, Jules. - Yeah? Thank you. You're welcome, girl. The first stop is the most important stop of the day. Your mind is about to be blown with delicious gloriousness. Okay, so, um, I'm a vegetarian. - Oh. - Yeah. Yeah, Greg. Have you not seen any of the documentaries about factory farming and the treatment of animals in the United States? - Uh, no. - I mean, it's... it's not appetizing, I'll say that. I mean, it's atrocious. Okay. Um, yeah. I think there's a vegan Indian place down the road. - Vegan? - Yeah. I'm just fucking with you, dude! I'm from Chicago, of course I eat meat! Come on. You are so gullible. Oh, my God. I am so fucked. I'm fisting it. Uh, you can. Go for it! Whoo! So, yeah, here we are. This is Hollywood. That looks like a bonsai tree, - but a big one. - Mm-hmm. It does. Like, the opposite of a bonsai tree, but the type of tree they make into bonsai plants? - Yeah. - Yeah. Are you a botanist? - On your mark... - Okay. ...get set... go! Oh, my God. This is amazing. No, you have a real talent. It's nothing. Really. But, thank you. I will keep it in mind just in case the writing thing doesn't work out. What is this? This is really good. Mm. Thank you. It's, um, a cabernet sauvignon from the Franzia region. - Oh, Franzia region. - Yes. Mm. - Near Napa. - Napa, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Well, I like it. Yeah, me, too. Lot of tannins. So, um... so, how's school going? Great, actually. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, the material's super interesting, and my professors are super smart. What about your classmates? - Super dorky. - Oh, nice. No, they're... they're good. It sounds like you made the right choice. Yeah, I don't know. I hope so. I'm pretty sure you did. Yeah? Yeah. To making the right choice. Cheers. I like how you decorated. Thanks. None of it's mine, but... the bookcase is mine. I like the bookcase. Thanks. We should, um... we should take a weekend trip to Franzia sometimes. Sometime. - Franzia. - Franzia. Franzia. I'm gonna put my wine down. Okay. But I'm gonna be right back. And now I'm back. - Can I, um... - Do you want to go this side? I just wanna go... I usually go like that side. Could you do that... on that side? - Yeah, I'll do this side. - Okay. Okay. Whatever. I can do both, actually. Okay. I'm skilled on both sides, too. I just have to say right off the top... - I like your tongue. - I was just gonna say right off the top, you are a great kisser. Thank you so much. So are you. Sometimes you kiss people and it's not good. - It's awful! - It's terrible. But this is great! Mm. Mm. Do you want to go to your room? That's a very loaded question. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Holy shit, look out! Greg's body was tingling with the abundant joy of new love. And also with a lot of nasty sexual stuff. His heart was fooled, his pain was gone, and it was all because of Peyton. The only thing Greg wanted to do was run away with her, get married, and live happily ever after. Ashley. Hey, Greg. Wow, you look great. What are you doing here? Can you talk? Uh... no. - Why? - Not a good time. I just need a few minutes. Please, Greg, it's important. - Fine, two minutes. - All right. But don't say anything. Okay. Greg? Greg? I must warn you, though, this could be a natural high of sorts, given with your love addiction and all. - Greg? - Where's my inhaler? Excuse me. Greg? What are you doing? - Is she here? - She's not here. She must be in class. Greg. Greg, have you been drinking? Just be careful not to rush things. When seems too good to be true, it often is. Why does everybody keep saying that to me? Please tell me what the hell is going on here? I'm in love. It's my roommate. She lives in my apartment and I'm in love with her and I've barely even seen her or spoken to her. It's like I... she can't be real. It's like she's too good to be true. Okay, you're really freaking me out now, Greg. Oh. And admit that you have a love addiction problem that needs immediate attention and aggressive rehabilitation. Sometimes the mind creates a fictional experience, a false high, similar to feelings of being lost and emptiness during depression. I don't want you to get too high and then crash and then take a step backwards. Greg? - Hi. - Hi. - Are you Greg? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Peyton. Oh, yeah, right, no. I-I'm sorry. I didn't... I... my... I thought that when... I thought that Peyton was a boy's name. I... no offense. Greg? Greg? Greg? Greg! Marilyn French once said, "Love is insanity." It's the taking over of the rational mind by delusion and self-destruction. I think it's fair to say, those words ring very true in my case. It's hard to know when my breakdown officially happened. Was it that moment I answered the front door and made Peyton up in my mind? Hi. Was it that moment Ashley left me for our couples therapist, Dr. Wilbon? Or was it something that was years in the making. Yes, yes. That's his soul mate, yes! Oh, God. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure. But, look, the good news is I'm working on getting better. Working really, really freakin' hard. Over the past year, I've attended 323 love addiction anonymous meetings. - I got a sponsor. - Yes, you're fucking crazy. Wait until you see who that is. Crazy. I've taken enough anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills to make Mona Lisa smile. And, look, I've been working out every day so I can get my fair share of endorphins. It's crazy, right? I've even begun meditating, for crying out loud. What the fuck, Mom? I told you I would call you back. Oh, hey, Father O'Connor? How's it hangin'? And my sudden lack of issues have vastly improved Dr. Naik's sleep intake. Doc? I'm doing some more adulting these days. Like watering the plants. And, now I'm purchasing wine in bottles. And I've upgraded from the microwave, to the stove and the oven. And Paul and I are living together now. Dude, where are you going? It's the only way he could make sure I didn't have a female roommate. - Why are you so sensitive? - Fuck you, Greg! And I actually did have a mature, adult conversation with Ashley. - For real this time. - That was not... And I got some really nice closure. ...a good moment for you. And to top that all off, I've been drinking a Los Angelan amount of green juice smoothies. Which you can presume reminds me of you-know-who every time I drink one. Yeah, are you a Broncos fan? Oh, God, there she is, huh? The one and only gorgeous, Peyton. Man, she was awesome, wasn't she? I totally concur. And look, I promise you however disappointed you are right now that she wasn't real, I am exponentially more upset about it. You have to admit, I might just have some potential as a writer after all, right? I mean, I did create her in my mind, didn't I? And I used this whole crazy experience for creative inspiration, and I started writing again. I actually wrote a short story called, Poor Greg Drowning: The Story of a Love Addict. It was recently published in a local magazine, and now, it's being adapted into an animated miniseries. It's officially been a year since I was violently thrashing rock bottom. And I'm hosting a little shindig at the casa de Paul and Greg tonight to celebrate. And you're all invited. So I'll see you there in three, two, one... I still can't believe you guys are dating. What can I say? She's got the best perennials on the entire block. Right, that's what it is. No, seriously, Miss D, I need to know. What's your secret to sprouting those gorgeous flush perennials in this crippling drought? Okay, if you must know... You boys have fun. Wow, that's incredible. Listen, bro. I am really proud of you. You had some major issues and you nutted up, faced 'em like a man. Congrats, my brother. Thanks, man. Should we hug it out? Sure. - All right - Mm. I want to second what our wise young friend just said here. You've come a long way, Greg. I'm very, very proud of you. Aw. Holy shit. You two? Congrats! Thank you. I'm so happy and proud for you. Listen, he may have put a ring on it, but I've still got a list with your name on it, just in case you're ever feeling a little inspired. All right, wow. Thank you. I'll catch you guys in just a little bit. You smell so good. And what's your name? I'm Paul. - There he is! - Hey Hey! Oh, it's so good. Gregorino! - Hi. - Okay. Okay, let go. - Mm-hmm. 'Kay. - Now sit. 'Kay. How are you feeling? Yeah, really good, actually. Yeah. That's great. So, did you talk to Ashley? Yeah, she's been really supportive through all this. And I think taking the time really made me realize what I was doing wrong in the relationship and why she did what she did. Not that that's an excuse, but it's not all her fault. No way. She's a bitch. That's her fault. - Dan. - Right? No. I'm really proud of you. It's not easy to look in the mirror - and examine your own self. - Yeah. Have you had any more of those hallucinations? Yeah, I have. Oh, Gregarino? - Not you. - Nope. - That's great. - Yeah. It's so weird though because she was so real. I know, but you remember what they said. That can be common when you're going through - that sort of thing. - Yeah. I know. Could she open a door on her own? No, it wasn't real. It's a hallu... Just have... stop. There's that pussy boy! Aw, my Trojan warrior! Ah! I still can't believe that you're Greg's sponsor, Hector. Who would have thought? Universe works in mysterious ways. - You are not kidding. - I am not. What a funny, funny world! I'm just happy this soldier's back on the squad. Yeah, thanks, man. Oh, shit! No they didn't! - Hi! - Hey, Mom! There's your Mom and her female lover. Right? - You look great. - Yeah, thanks, so do you! And this place, wow, it's incredible! I know, right? I'm all, living with Paul certainly has its perks. - Which one's his mom? - That's my mom! So, how's my favorite broad in the whole wide world doing? I am doing great. I may or may not have engineered a quick little pit stop at the old In-N-Out - on the way here. - Oh, shit! - Animal style!? - It's the only way. Unh! I'm sorry, Mary Jane! How's my favorite step-mom doing? She is doing great, sweetheart. - Oh, it's good to see you. - Oh, it's good to see you, too. Although, I have to admit, I am a little queasy from the drive, your mother on the 405. The woman drives like a battle axe. Would you hush it up, MJ? I love riling you up. Isn't she the cutest? - She sure is. - And Father O'Connor! How is my favorite man of the big man upstairs doing!? How many times do I have to tell you, Greg? I'm not a Father. I'm a Rabbi. I'm Jewish. Well, bless you either way. Thank you. All right, I'm gonna go outside and get some fresh air. - You want some company? - No, no, it's okay. You guys, you guys... I'll just be a second. - You guys go mingle. - All righty. We'll go say hi to Jules and her odd boyfriend. Mr. Stiffy. One would hope. Peyton?
