Such things happened to me last year that nothing could surprise me anymore. A few months back I wouldn't have believed it could rain in summer or that fish could get you out of suspension. I also wouldn't have believed that atoms had a heart, or that I'd finally find the courage to stand up against everybody. No, like that. That's it! So, what had finally defeated Saul's reign had been... Greed. What is greed? Anybody? Yes? -It's like it was with Midas. Very good. Does anybody know the story about king Midas? King Midas... Hey, there's still 20 minutes left! Eli? Eli? On PTA Day, too? Why are you always picking on Eli? Get out, Leibo. An essay, a comment in your personal file or a thousand times... Let's make it 5,000 times... "I will never again disrupt classes "either by ordering pizza to class or by..." -An essay. But I... I'd like to choose the subject myself. -Why, Eli? In any case... At the end you always admit it. I don't know, I guess it's fun. -Well, fun costs. 10 pages, a one line notebook, no repetitions. By Sunday. Move it! My dad is the town of Herzlyia's architect. That means that if you want to build something in town, you need his permission. Careful. Thank you. Unfortunately... As far as we're concerned, nothing has changed. Ben, you must have come from some ivory tower. You don't know how we do things around here. OK, I've only been here four years but... Thanks for the tip. -These things can backfire right at you. Are you threatening me? -Not at all. Come on, Eli! Stop dreaming! Sorry. -Keep your eyes on the ball! Who plays goalie? What did she say? -Who, the counselor? She said you're a good kid but a bit on the wild side. That a bad thing? -Only half bad. Teach said you're up to mischief and they're sick of punishing you. We're going home? But we said... Marks like yours deserve no reward. Turn the key. Good. Now... Go. Faster, go! That was the last time we had fun together before things went awry. Step on it, don't be shy! Go! Awesome! Slow down. And not a word to mom. "Eli" Are we going out to sea? -Not today. Hey, what're you doing? It's alright. -It's not alright! Got permission to take pictures? It's alright, it's for a newspaper. There are nicer yachts here, why shoot this one? It's not about yachts. Fucking journalists! I'm a good kid, but a bit on the wild side. There's a slight drop in his grades. You're the only father I know who admires his son for not studying. Come on, you're exaggerating. -I'm sick of being the mean parent. Why can't you be a dad, for a change? What's he doing here? Maybe he misses you. What did they say at the PTA? -Only good things. Like last term? He's doing fine, don't worry. This morning, as I came out of the house and walked to my car, I saw a guy taking my pictures. What?! How come? -It's apparently for the award. Perhaps they're preparing a reportage about me. Couldn't they just ask for my photo? Why lurk there like thieves? Some days are better skipped. So many things happened that day I wouldn't know where to begin. That was some awesome beach party. -Forget the beach... You wouldn't believe the girls... Tell me I'm dreaming, please. -You're not. What's wrong? Left your GPS at home? Got lost? Or maybe you just don't give a damn about the law? This is a public place. You can't make laws like that. Turn around and get back before I show you laws! He keeps walking. One more step and your slut mother won't recognize you! -Your mother! What's this, Leibo, eh? You mention my mother again, it won't end with a stone. It's Ruben! Ruben's coming! Tell him to go to the principal or I'll call the police! You alright? Let's go back to fractions... Look at the fractions in the exercises I gave you... Two weeks' suspension, a comment in my personal file and a pre-expelling warning. Leibo, get out! Go on! How many one-ninths in a third? -Shirley! How many one-ninths in 3? Every one-ninth of a kilometer another crop is grown... Hey, Shirley, how're things? Everything's fine. What're you doing? -Just sitting here with Hillit. Bye. -Bye. Shirley? Shirley? Shirley, come here a sec. What is it? -You haven't given me an answer. About what? -I've proposed we go out together. Ah, that. No. Why not? -I'm in love with Gal Schperer. If I go out with you, he'll never ask me out. Gal Schperer? The one with the back-brace? It's coming off soon. -Hold on. Maybe... Why don't you go out with me till his brace comes off? -No! Wanna see some magic? -No magic. Either you buy something or you go. I'll show you a trick. You can show it to your children. My children live abroad. -They left you? Yes. Go back to school. -Do you sell bongs? Hey, stop... Put it down here. What's the police doing here? They think I did something wrong. You? -It's a mistake, don't worry. I have to go with them for a couple of days. D'you mind getting me my toothbrush and some toothpaste from upstairs? Eli... Yes? How's school? Okay. What about Shirley? You asked her out yet? How come you know Shirley? -I don't, I was just guessing. I didn't give him the permit so he fabricated this against me. Son of a bitch. We're out of toothpaste, so I got you the Bazooka kind. Great. I won't have to worry about my teeth anymore. I was worried... At the police they always give their guests candy and ice-lollies. Hardly any normal food over there. I'm serious. You don't believe me? Let's ask him... Excuse me? You always give your guests candy and stuff, am I right? Sure. Ice-lollies, waffles, chewing-gum... That's why I only have gold teeth. Come on, really... That's just the kid's games. It's evidence. Leave it here. I didn't tell the cop my name but he knew it anyway. He also knew Shirley Bar-El's name. OK, we're done here. Get out, guys, please. Mr. Yassif... if you will. What do they think you did? Remember I told you about those people... Who want to build a mall at the park and at the stadium. Yes. -Well... The police think I received money, and in return I gave these people a permit to build somewhere in town. Is it true? No, it's a lie. Call my parents, and make sure he doesn't watch the news. They claim that the Appolonia project... That was previously a conservation area... So he allegedly pressured the council, presented them with inaccurate specifics and got a tax reduction, and received half a million dollars for it. I've no idea where that came from. Thanks, sweetie. Bye. Mom? How come that cop knew my name, and Shirley's? They've bugged our phone, months ago. They know everything. They also know what you've said to your friends on the phone. So? I had to learn from the police that you have a new girlfriend? I don't. She said no. Her loss. -She's waiting for Gal Schperer. Gal? The one with the back-brace? -It's coming off soon. Eli, dad said you shouldn't watch TV today. Come, my little jungle cat, come to me... "The Embezzling Architect" "Herzlyia's Architect, Ben Yassif, is suspected of..." "It is suspected that Herzlyia's Architect "received half a million dollars, "and in return acted out of a conflict of interests..." You believe this bullshit? Thanks, Leibo. -Best friends or no best friends? Wait, aren't you on suspension? -Cancelled. No suspension, no comment and no warning. How come? It's magic. You coming? Yair Azulai? -Here. Shani Biton? -He's sick. You were right. Come in! Excuse me, my teacher needs a marker. Schperer, could you lend me your back-gadget for tonight? I've got a date. Aren't you going to visit your dad in jail today? He can't, we have a date with your mom. Last time made her so hot, she'd been calling us every day. What a bummer day. -Why? Why? Normally I have 50% attendance. Today, all of a sudden, 100% of the students showed up. All of a sudden they're interested. Maybe they are interested. Yes? Seriously? I see. Thank you. They're going to hold him for another 48 hours. There are no half a million dollars nor have ever been. My client is driving a 65' model car. He is an exceptionally honest man and people like him, in high places, always have enemies. Thank you very much. How're things, Bello? -Okay. I heard my dad tell my mom where the money is. Where is it? -You nuts? Like I'm gonna tell you. He'll kill me if I do. Spill it. I'll tell no one. Swear on your dick. Swear on your dick! I swear. Bottom of the river, near my granddad's house. Amos, there's nothing here! Nothing. It's the kid. He's jerking us around. I was convinced I had them fooled and that when I came back from school dad will already be home, showered and fresh. What did you do that for? I wanted you to let my dad go. You think I enjoy having him in jail? I wouldn't know. That was a nice trick. But you always have to think things through. Your dad had been detained for 3 extra days because of you. Until we've finished dragging the bottom of the river. He's getting out tomorrow. For two weeks house arrest. You watch over him. Get in the car for a sec. Eli... Your dad's a clever man. But sometimes, when "good life" people get into trouble and then to court and into jail, they find it difficult to deal with. Then sometimes, not necessarily in this case but sometimes, they get depressed, or they hurt themselves or they make mistakes. If your father is strong, if he holds out, then even if he's convicted he'll only get 18 months in a "white collar" jail. What's that? -Jail for the privileged. You'll be able to visit him a lot and then, slowly but surely, you'll all get over it. But if he panics, if, for example, he decides to flee the country, you're gonna lose him. You're just trying to scare me. These things happen all the time. I want you to watch him very closely. While he's in house arrest, and after. If at any point you feel that he's planning to flee I want you to come to the station and we'll settle it quietly. Among the three of us. OK? My dad didn't do anything. Go on... Go back to school. Eli... What's going on with Shirley? -Nothing's going on. She said no. She's waiting for Gal Schperer. -Schperer? The one with the back-brace? -It's coming off soon. I've got a foolproof trick for you. You go and ask her best friend for a date. Hit on her. Go out with her for a few weeks, Tell the whole world that you're madly in love, and then do the switch and go back to Shirley. Have you tried it? -Twice. Once when I was your age, and again when I was... Never mind. Do it. Thanks. -And... wait. Here. Keep it. Hillit... Come here a sec. What is it? Wanna be my girlfriend? What?! But you asked Shirley just a few days ago! Yes, well... You don't have to if you don't want to. -No... You really want to? Yes. Okay. Cool. -Bye. Great. Dad'll be very pleased. When exactly is he getting out? -Tomorrow at 14:00. But he won't have us come pick him up so at least let's wait for him here, together. OK? -Sure. Yes, boy? I need to get to Abu-Kabeer. What's in Abu-Kabeer? -My dad's getting out today. Got any money? OK, get in. But... not in this car. That's my granddad's building. Your granddad's a contractor? -He's an architect. They're giving him the Israel Award of this year. But he doesn't like to talk about it. Pull over here. Ice-cream, anybody? -No, thanks. Now, to the beach. -What about the house arrest? This is no time for shell collecting. I'm taking you home. -To the beach! Take us home. Giving orders to your dad now? You, too? I asked you a question! Take us home. Buildings shimmering in the sunlight. Subject? Predicate? Anybody? Yes, Hillit? Hillit! I'm sorry, teach, didn't mean to. -Go to the principal's office. It was just a handstand, not a flic-flac or anything. Go on. Stop! Eli... about your punishment, your essay... It's fine. It's good. But the boy you're talking about is just... Just a boy? -No, he... He's just beating himself up for no reason. He was just trying to help his dad. But that's why they kept his dad in jail for 3 more days. The boy wasn't to blame. It's the intention that counts. He wanted his father to be freed, so whatever happened later was not his doing. When are you gonna write another one? What?! I didn't do anything! -That's right. But why don't you write another one just in case? When you pull off another stunt, that'll be counted for. So my grandson is an errand boy now? Granddad! Here, this is for you. Here you are. -Thanks. And in the Appolonia affair. In the next few days, the police will deliver its recommendations to the Attorney General. The police is likely to recommend that Ben Yassif be charged with fraud, breach of trust, taking bribes and conflict of interest. It is still too early to assume whether in fact he'll be charged but Amos Yanai had already gained the nickname "Conviction Champion " with almost a 100% of convictions, so I'd be very much surprised if, eventually, we do not see Ben Yassif in court. We're talking, of course, about the police Superintendent who was in charge of the "Stopnico Affair". You have the soul of an artist. The question is, what are you going to do with it? Too many lives just go to waste. Leave him alone, He can deal with it later. Won't you rather use a plate? -No. Don't let anybody mislead you. Music, literature, theatre, cinema, all that's very well but they're conditioned. You always need to push the "play" button. Push the "play" button? -That's right. To push "play". On the stereo, on the video, to buy a theatre ticket, to open a book... But once you've designed a building, after having gone through the whole painful process, it's there and it needs no permission to exist. People live within your creation. Sometimes they die in it. Your dad used to do quite alright in our profession. But then, for some mysterious reasons, he chose to distance himself from the real architectural doing and befriend politicians, party workers and beastly contractors, until... Someone framed you. It's clear. I'm off. Are you coming to dinner Friday night? No, we'll be here. -That's right, house arrest... Walk me to my car? Come on. Civil clothes. Civil clothes? -They're cops. They're watching your dad. See you, sweetie. -Bye, granddad. Yes, kid? Can I help you? Are you looking for something? No thanks, we're waiting for a friend. Where does your friend live? He... Right here. What's his name? -Listen, kid... You're watching in case my dad leaves the house, right? We're not watching anything, now scram. You're wasting your time. My dad didn't do anything! Dad? What're you doing? Go back to bed. But they're outside! -That's why I'm leaving through here. Go to bed, I'll be right back. "Important evidence. A case of a lifetime. "Tomorrow at 14:00. Agadir. Alone." The chief's hassling me non-stop, and now you? Hi. -Hi. Double espresso, please. A small latte for me. You drink coffee? -Sure. You got me out of an event. Now my wife's mad at me and her family thinks I'm a snob. So? "The case of a lifetime"? They mentioned you on TV. They said you're a champion. Everybody you dealt with ended up in jail. The media likes to picture it that way. Like I'm a magician or something. I... I just wanted to ask you that if you find out you're wrong, and that my dad didn't do it, Lay off him. Completely. Even if the media will stop calling you "Heavyweight Conviction Champion". -Wow! That's a new one. You promise? -And what do you promise? What d'you want me to promise? Why are you crying, Eli? I don't know. It's all such a mess. One double espresso. -Thanks. And one latte. -I'm a kid, I don't drink coffee! Bring him a hot cocoa instead. Eli... I promise you, If your dad didn't do anything, he'll go home. And if he tries to flee like you said? People who did nothing don't flee. Please, your honour, don't send me to jail, I'm begging you! What are you doing? Tell me, why did you ask me to go out with you? I want to be your boyfriend. But we do nothing together, we hardly talk. I'm not in the mood. Is it your dad? I know how you feel. When my mom was sad, after my little brother was born, I was sad all the time, too. What do you do then? -That's simple. You have to play it happy all the time, as if you just got the coolest gift ever. What, like an e-scooter? -Whatever. The main thing is to smile and to laugh, and that might help him get back to normal. Did it work for you? Either that, or the pills. Both, I think. Hi, Dad. -Hi. -How're things? You alright? -Sure! School today was such fun! -Yeah? What was the big deal? In general, you know. You raised Eli, eh? -What?! Me? No way! How was your day? -Loads of fun too. Hillit? -Speaking. It's Eli. What's so funny? I'm glad you called. Your idea didn't work. It didn't? D'you want to meet? But we have a vocabulary test tomorrow, You really study for that? -No way! OK. At the bowling, in an hour. Bummer! Let's get out of here. -But we just got here. I hate this game. You're nuts. -Your mama. So we're staying? Stop it, it's just a game. Shall I tell you my secret? I took all my Chi into my navel. What's a Chi? It's from Tai Chi. The energy of life. My dad doesn't believe in it, but I do. You're thinking about him? -Yes. How long d'you get for what he did? -He didn't do it! Tomorrow I see the psychologist. 'Cause of the handstands. Counselor sent you? -Yeah. You, too? Yeah, when school started, but my dad told her mischief is not a disorder and it shouldn't be oppressed. Tell me something... How come you asked me to go out with you? Why shouldn't I? Well, I'm not pretty, nor very popular, and even my marks suck. But you're fun. -You, too. Let's drink the rain! Bye. See you tomorrow. Could you tell Amos that Eli says hi? Eli! Eli! Hi. How are you? Rotem has suffered a light concussion. He'll have to stay home for a few more days then he'll go back to school good as new. Right, Rotem? -Never. I spoke with the school. The bully's getting what he deserves. I don't care. Rotem, for your information, you're not missing anything. Lately, school sucks. -You see? I feel nauseous. The doctor said it's to be expected. I'll push on, Mrs... Call me Anat. -Anat. You'll come over? I'll try. -Great. Following six months of a thorough investigation, the Attorney General recommends that Ben Yassif be put on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and taking bribes. The Attorney General claims Ben Yassif and Arieh Weissman have joined together... I remembered that man from the night before. You know that man? -Seen him on TV. Then and there I realized it's all been a pack of lies. Sometimes you believe people just because you love them. I don't think I'll ever make that mistake again. Eli, get me a beer. -I don't wanna. Ben... Ben! What are you doing? They're right outside! Wait till tomorrow! Is your dad's house arrest over? -Yes, why? He's here to pick you up. Tell him I went out the other gate. I heard you had a good time at the bowling. -Yes. Well, Schperer just needs to see one other specialist. If his opinion's the same, then the brace stays till 9th grade. Poor bastard. No way I'll wait until 9th grade. When's the verdict? -Monday. They're taking him to some specialist in Beer-Sheba. But I don't want Hillit to get hurt. So dump her, wait one week and then ask me out again. Why would you want to go out with me? You don't want to? -How come you want it now? I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? Yeah, sure. -OK. Right. Great. Bye. Thanks for coming. -I'm just... I can't stay long, I've got things to do. That's alright. How are you? Did my mom call you? No way! Did Leibo send you to spy? -Spy?! What are you, a toddler? Did teacher send you with homework? I just came by to see how you were. I haven't thrown up since yesterday but I still got fever and a headache. You're lucky. This morning, all I wanted was to have some fever. It didn't even come close. You should ask your friend to hit you on the head too. What's that? -The atomic mushroom. People saw it as far as 35 miles from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first two atom bombs were dropped there. What's your thing with it? -It's interesting, you know. Think about it. You can't see an atom. It's tiny. But once you hit it, once you disrupt its wholeness, like its heart, see what happens? Nice picture. That's OK, I've got one of a test explosion in the Sahara. I've been meaning to replace it for a long time now. -Thanks. Well, I... Got to go. How about we watch nude girls on the Internet? Nah, some other time. You alright? -I'm fine. Tell me something. How did you manage to avoid suspension? Does it matter? I'm just curious. I'll tell you, but don't let it slip out, OK? -No problem. The fishes got me out. The fishes? -Yeah, fishes got me out. How come? -My dad offered the Principal a split A/C for the teacher's floor. -He did? Then he added an aquarium for his office: miniature sharks, silurids, pretty algae. A 6-foot aquarium. Cost him about 3,000 shekels. I told him I wished he could do the same for Eli's dad, would get him out of jail, house arrest, the trial, everything. My dad laughed so hard... Supper'll be ready in 5 minutes. I had pizza. What's that? Eli... Since when d'you read the paper? Since I got interested in liars. Who's there? Who says Ankara? Most of you. I see. I would like to surprise you... Hi, sweetie. Come in. That's a very sexy bandage. Your punishments weren't enough? Don't remind me, I'm still recovering. Silence! What's so funny? -He got off clean. A one-day suspension, that's all. Turetz? When's the next newspaper? -In a week. Could I write something for it? I thought you weren't talking to fucking journalists. I am now. -All the sections are full, Music, Singles... You could write for the sports. -No, it's something else. You can only write for sections. -We've done that, Yaron. And we said it's not right. -You said that. OK, submit it by Thursday for our staff meeting. -Great. Eli's conduct has changed completely. First of all, Carmel, his Bible teacher, says he started writing essays voluntarily. No more false bells, no more stink-bombs, no more ordering pizza to classes, no more playing with his hair... Not even disruptions, only very minor ones. The kid has changed completely. Exemplary conduct. What? Aren't you afraid? -Of Leibo? And of the Principal? -Mostly of Leibo. I am. OK. We've decided to put it in but we'd like to change your headline into "Leibo's Gold Fish". I don't know if there are any gold fish in there. Doesn't matter. It's like in the fairy tale, the gold fish that grants wishes. Weren't you listening last year when we studied literature? The gold fish is the money of Leibo's dad that gets him out of everything. Oh, I see! "Leibo's Gold Fish"... I like that. Eli! What's up? Talk to you later. I have an idea. Let's go to McDonald's, we'll have a double with potato chips and a coke then we'll go to the "Freak's" see what's new. Eh? I don't feel like it. What d'you feel like doing? -Nothing. Here's your building, the one you've designed. You won't let me forget, eh, Eli? Forget? Why? It's an ugly building. No it isn't. It's thick, it's alienated and it's ugly. What's that? -It's nothing. Forget it. Put it in your backpack. Go on, put it in! Come on. What're you doing? Don't put it into work just yet. I want you here tomorrow with samples, OK? Yes. Yes, I'd like to... Listen... I'll get back to you later, OK? Bye. What do you intend to do? What can I do? It's already out. Nonsense. It's a kids' newspaper. OK, guys, you can read the paper after class. And there's a lot to read in there. I'm giving you 5 minutes. If you don't stop reading by then, I'll collect the papers and you won't get them back. My best friend? I hope they put your dad away for life! What's going on? Your honour, I'm innocent. Please don't send me to jail! I'm begging you, your honour! "We'll beat the shit out of you, you scum!" Aharon Shem-Tov? Single?! Hello? Eli, this is Anat, Rotem's mom. Hi. I want you to know that what you did was great. You were very brave. Eli, you still there? -Yes. Honey, I'm taking what you wrote and I'm moving it on. It won't end in school. OK? Alright. Can I speak with Superintendent Amos? In there. Eli! That's a surprise! How are you? -I'm OK. Anything wrong? All kinds of stuff. Come on. What'll it be this time, a cocoa or a latte? Rivi, do we have any cocoa here? -Yes, in the machine. Do me a favor, go get Eli a small cocoa. Thank you. -You're welcome. Your son? Yes. Right now he's studying hard for his exams. Thanks. It's not easy for him. What about Shirley? For the time being I'm with Hillit. When d'you plan to do the switch? I don't know. What's so funny? That's the trouble with the trick. You get stuck before the switch. You fall in love with the girl. -It happened to you, too? Twice. Why did you teach me that trick if it never works? I didn't want you to get stuck with Shirley till the end of high school. Could have wasted your whole childhood. Give me a break. A girl who kisses her cellular after each and every call? The hell with Shirley and her Schpritzer! The main thing is you found love. Hillit sounds very lovely. She's special. Have you kissed her yet? No, not yet. What're you waiting for? I have a meeting. Were you... Just passing by, or...? There's something on your mind. Yes, I... I wanted to ask you something. The other day, when you came to my school, why were you thinking my dad was planning to flee the country? Why? I have a feeling about people. Your dad is special. He's like you. He's into freedom, he's not made for jail. But let's change the subject. What've you got in there? You're something else! He's singing like a nightingale. Names, dates, the lot. -Great. But I'm busy here, so... Alright, we'll talk later. Where were we? That's alright, I gotta go now. Eli... I've really got to go. Bye. Hi. Sorry I'm late. What's wrong with you? -What's wrong with me? Go, go to your little slut, that's what you wanted all along! You asked me out just to get to Shirley, right? Where did that come from? Give me a break. Your friend Leibo told me everything. When? Right, I'm on my way. You got the balls to show your face in school? I don't feel like getting in trouble again. Come to the playground at 7 and I just might forgive you. Which city... Is easier to reach... "Blackboard and chalk, a map on the wall "A notebook, then the ringing of the bell..." From Europe... -"That was..." -Rotem! "The teacher got me confused." -Rotem, what's the matter with you? Stop it, that's not like you. Rotem? -"l was just like Plato..." Rotem, I'm talking to you. I'll send you out. "If you were just a little less my teacher..." I'll send you out! "If you were just a little more my girlfriend..." Stop it or I'll send you to the Principal's office. "Then I'd show you who is the most mature kid in class..." Excuse me! Now get out and go see the Principal! What's the matter with you? Yes? He started singing in class. Idit sent him here. Come in, come in. What were you singing, Rotem? Rotem, what were you singing? Rotem, what were you singing? Go back to your class, please. I've been thinking for some time now, trying to recall whether you've looked me in the eyes, just once, and denied it. Well then, if you don't deny it, at least admit it like a man. Will that satisfy you? Satisfy me...? A cement monster like that in the middle of the sky?! That's against everything you've been taught in this house. Next month they'll be giving me the Israel Award... What will people say then? Poor guy... His son, the scheming criminal, had sold his father's soul for a fistful of pennies. Tell me something. Do you really think I did it for the money? If not for the money then for what? Come on, for what? That money wasn't just for the permit. It was a down payment. A down payment on what? "Congress Gate". They're planning a new complex in Jerusalem: a 30-story hotel and an international congress center, and I was supposed to design it. I see. A huge down payment on a job you'll never do. Do you really believe they would've let you design it? "Son of 'Corruption Architect' Exposes Corruption in School" Eli... Come here. This... This is very good. It's really good. Mom will be back by 10 o'clock tonight. I have to go away for a while. It's just 18 months at a white collar jail, and... And we'll come visit you all the time. Then when it's over, everything will be back to normal. I've opened your envelope, the white one. You know what it's like when you play with your Playstation and all of a sudden you reach Game Over? Yeah. I'm at Game Over now, see? And I can't... I can't seem to be able to get over it. When are you leaving? -Tonight. You're taking the yacht? Do you love us at all? What do you mean? Of course, I'm crazy about you. But you love yourself more. -No. No, no, that's not true. I'm going to call mom. -Mom knows. Listen, you'll be coming to visit me once a year and you'll bring a friend with you. It'll be fun. Believe me. -You're lying! You're lying now like you've been lying all along! Eli... I was in jail for 10 days... Now you're talking 18 months! I won't be able to stand it. I'm leaving tonight, 8 o'clock. Will you come to say goodbye? Let's go look for the son of a bitch. Take your time. Hello? Amos? Yes, Eli, how are you? -I'm fine. I... What can I do for you, Eli? I need you to... I... What do you need? I need you to come to the marina, right away. The marina? I want you to convince my dad not to go away. Like you said the other day, among the three of us. Eli... You've got to understand. I'm a cop. Your father makes a mistake, he'll have to pay. I'm sorry. I really am. Bye. Leibo, I beg you, tomorrow you can hit me ten times harder but let me go now, please. -You think? Ben! Ben! You damn coward! Running away, you son of a bitch?! Why are you leaving me? "Eli" "Eli" Turn around. -What? -Come on, turn around. Fuck, we're screwed. Going on vacation, Mr. Yassif? Passport, please. Aharon Shem-Tov. Nice name. You know what that means. He went back. You saw him, he turned around. Yes, I saw him. He just took a little trip before the trial. He was just violating an order, it won't make any difference. You need a ride? No, I'm good. On one hand we have the desert, the big, yellow desert that in fact... Rise and shine! That takes up most of Egypt, and on the other hand we have the Nile Valley that goes all along the length of Egypt where the Nile flows. Thank you. This belongs to whom? It's mine. Okay. You know the rule, right? "Hi. Want to be my girlfriend? " Who is it for? I sent it to Hillit. You'll answer him after class, OK? It is the longest river in the world... And actually it is made of two rivers: the Blue Nile and the White Nile. The White Nile starts at Victoria Lake, while the Blue Nile starts at Tana Lake The Blue Nile, as it is called, starts at Victoria Lake. I'd like to show you a photo so you can see the contrast... between the river... and the mountains... The trial of Ben Yassif, ex Herzlyia's architect, is opening this morning... Shall we go?
