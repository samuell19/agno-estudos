(Footstep) Herbert : No. Not my son! (Baby cries out) (Pounds On Door) Snatcher : Wake his lordship. Snatcher : The unspeakable has happened Snatcher : We must speak of it immediately! Lord Portley-Rind : What is it, Snatcher? Snatcher : Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child. Lord Portley-Rind :(aghast) No Snatcher : They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now! Lord Portley-Rind : A horrible tragedy. Let’s deal with it in the morning! Snatcher : Stop! Oh, oof! That's not the worst of it! Next they'll come after... Snatcher : Our Cheese! Lord Portley-Rind : (gasp) My Gouda!? Snatcher : They’ll stop at nothing. Lord Portley-Rind : You’re the town exterminator. I’ll pay whatever it takes. Snatcher : Oh, I don’t want money. I want one of those. Lord Portley-Rind : A White Hat? You?! Absurd! Snatcher : Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your... Lord Portley-Rind : Very well. Every boxtroll gone. With proof! Snatcher : For a white hat? I will destroy every last boxtroll in this town! (Lightning Crashes) Snatcher : Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, the curfew is in force. Don’t dawdle or the beasts will tear you limb from limb! They will add your flesh to their rivers of blood and mountains of bones. Snatcher : Child! Do you want to end up like the Trubshaw Baby? Dragged underground and feasted upon one year ago this very night?! Lock your windows! Bolt your doors! Hide anything that is not bolted down. Hide your cheese. Hide your tender and delicious babies! Beware the bloodthirsty monsters! They'll fry your eyes; gnaw on your knees, gobble your gizzards... Beware! (Man Hole Opening) Fish : Eww.... Blech... Hmm... (Cocks Ticking) Shoe : Huh? Gimme that! Fish : Ohhhh... Snatcher : Gentlement! Look at all these boxes left lying about. How curious, how peculiar. I do believe... evil is afoot. I do believe... evil is a foot. Mr. Gristle : Ha...Ha...Ha... Foot. Mr. Pickles : Huh... Mr. Trout : Ermmm... Mr. Pickles : You ever seen someone’s foot be evil, Mr. Trout? Mr. Trout : I believe the boss meant evil is nearby, Mr. Pickles. Mr. Pickles : My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. I wouldn’t say the foot itself was evil. Mr. Trout : No.. No.. it’s just a fancy-man’s word for vicinity. Mr. Pickles : Wrinkly ol’ bunion looked like my grandmum. Had to saw her off... The bunion...not my grandmum. Mr. Gristle : Ahhh.. Foot! Mr. Trout : There’s one! Mr. Pickles : Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your days of evil-doin’ are over. Mr. Gristle : Boom! He.. He..He.. Mr. Trout : You really think these boxtrolls understand the duality of good and evil? Mr. Pickles : They must, right? Why else would they hide from us. Mr. Gristle : Nice! Nice! Mr. Pickles : We are the good guys. Mr. Trout : Yeah... I suppose we are. Mr. Gristle : Hmm? Yeah...Foot! Snatcher : Mr. Gristle! Snatcher : Acquire Them! Mr. Gristle : Acquire! Acquire! Ha..Ha..Ha..! Mr. Gristle : Come back and let me hit you! Fish : “Eggs?” “Eggs?” “You see Egg?” Fish : “Eggs?” Sparky and Bucket : “Over there!” Knickers : Ahhhh!!!! Fish : “Eggs?” Fish : “Eggs?” Fish : “Eggs?” Oil Can : “He’s up there!” Fish : “Eggs?” Eggs : (growls) Fish! Egg : Ermm... Fish... Fish : Fish fix no problem Eggs : Do do doo do doo... Fish : Do do doo do doo... (Alarm Chimes) Eggs : Wake up! (Music Box Winding) (Music Box Playing) (Hammer Pounding) Egg : Uuuu... (Record Playing) (Songs Playing) Oil Can : Aaaahhhh! Boxtrolls : Aaaaahhhhh! Eggs : Ha! Missed me! Fish : Oooo! Oil Can : uuuhhhh! Mr. Gristle : Ha! Haaa! Mr. Pickles : Another villain off the streets! Mr. Gristle : Ha! Haaa! Eggs : What?! Fish : Hide. Egg : This way.. Eggs : Shoe! Come on. Shoe : (gurgles angrily) Winnie : Boxtrolls! They could come eat my face off at any moment. I’d better warn father. (Knocking on Door) Lord Portley-Rind : Settle down, men, settle down. Important town business to discuss. First on the docket: more complaints of crumbling bridges. Langsdale : Speaking of crumbling... is that a new blue cheese I see? Broderick : (Sniff..Sniff) Does smell delicious. Lord Portley-Rind : I suppose we could do with a nibble first. Broderick : Mmm... Pungent... Langsdale : Complex... Broderick : I’m tasting notes of..ermmm... plum! Lord Portley-Rind : All good fun, but we do have this school funding initiative to vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of... Broderick : Cutting open the Roquefort next? (All Aye!!) Lord Portley-Rind : Well, okay, okay. A quick reminder, tomorrow is Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day. And we all know what that means...Ha..ha..ha.. a performance by Madame Frou Frou. Boulanger : A vision! Broderick : Now there’s a woman... Langsdale : ... With some cheese on her bones! Ha..Ha..Ha.. Lord Portley-Rind : A lady like that is like a fine brie. Raw... Dangerous.... (Sniff) Maybe a little stinky, but one taste and you’ll be begging for.... mmm.... Winnie : Father! Lord Portley-Rind : Winifred! Boulanger : Is someone there? Lord Portley-Rind : Winifred go on. Off to bed. Off to bed! Come on, come on. Winnie : But Father! I saw boxtrolls again! Lord Portley-Rind : Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Winnie : They’re right outside. They could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment! (Loud Grunts) White Hats : Would be a shame to miss this, Portley-Rind! Lord Portley-Rind : Yes, yes one moment! Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over grotesque monsters. Winnie : I’m not obsessed! I just can’t stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Winnie : Father? Father. Lord Portley-Rind : Mmm hmm. Yes...Yes.. (Winnie Grunting) Winnie : If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me? Lord Portley-Rind :Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred. Winnie :Father! Lord Portley-Rind : What? Uh... White Hat? Right.What.. Oh, seems to have been smudged by a bit of brie. Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash,would you? Winnie : But-­ Lord Portley-Rind : Now gentlemen, I apologize...sorry! Back to important White Hat business... Pass the Camembert! Winnie : I’ll give your hat a wash allright. Winnie : Ha! Winnie : Hah!!!! White Hat : (Laughing) Winnie : Uh oh. (Doors Lock Latching) ( Winnie Squeks) Winnie : Who... who's there? (Gasps) Winnie : Huh?? Who are you, boy? Eggs : Boy? Eggs : Why would she call me that? Boxtroll : (Supprised) Mr. Pickles : They're right there, Mr. Trout! Mr. Gristle : We’re right behind you. Ha hahaha! (Winnie Gasps) Snatcher : Hmm. Someone’s out past curfew. Very dangerous. Winnie : I... I saw a boy. Snatcher : All I saw was filthy boxtroll monsters. Snatcher : Miss Portley-Rind. Allow me to escort you home. Winnie : I can escort myself, thank you. Snatcher : Errr... Winnie : If you’ll just give me my father’s hat back. Snatcher : Yes, how did this hat find itself aaaaall the way out here? Winnie : The... wind! Blew it, right out the window. Very windy tonight! (Snatcher licks finger) Snatcher : Hmmm. Must’ve died down. Suddenly! Winnie :There’s no need for you to come in inside. Snatcher : Oh, but as a gentleman, I insist. (White Hat Lauging) Snatcher : Lord Portley-Rind! Winnie : Can I have the hat back now? Pleeeeaseee... Lord Portley-Rind : What in Gouda’s name is going on? Archibald Snatcher? Snatcher : Deepest apologies, your Lordship. But I found something out in the street that belongs to you. Lord Portley-Rind : Huh!! My White Hat! Winnie : Huh? Lord Portley-Rind : I’ll take that... Now, now, Snatcher one doesn’t acquire a white hat by simply picking it up... off the street. (Snatcher Grunting) Lord Portley-Rind : A white hat indicates privilege, prestige, position! It must be earned. Langsdale : With Valor! Boulanger : Chivalry! Broderick : Or being rich! That’s how I got it. Snatcher : Oh, don’t I know it, Sirs. Snatcher : Fortunately, we still have our little... agreeeeement. Lord Portley-Rind : Um.. ehhh... Snatcher : When I destroy every last boxtroll in this town, I shall earn my white hat... and join you in the Tasting Room. (Door Slams Shut) Lord Portley-Rind : Good lord. Not sure who should be more terrified - the boxtrolls or us. (White Hat Laughing) Lord Portley-Rind : Now, how the devil did my hat get outside in the first place? Snatcher : I was told the wind had something to do with it. Lord Portley-Rind : The wind, eh? Winnie :Father, I’m sorry-­ Snatcher : Sorry! Can’t stay. Too much work to do. Miss Portley-Rind, your Lordship, Sirs. I bid you good night. I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other again very, very soon. (Door close) Lord Portley-Rind : Hmmmm.. Winnie Snatcher : Don’t forget. I’m a size six-and-a­half. Order ahead. Snatcher : Ugh! Winnie : Father, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to. Well, at first I did, but I think this situation offers a great opportunity for a father and daughter to discuss their feelings... Winnie : WAIT! I saw something out there. A boy with boxtrolls... Lord Portley-Rind : Not another word. Winnie : But Father I really... Lord Portley-Rind : Bed! Winnie : I did see a boy... Mr. Pickles : Hark! Here come The Exterminators Mr. Gristle : EXTERMINATED.... Ha..Ha..Ha Mr. Trout : But don’t that sound like we’re the villains? Mr. Pickles : Huh. Eggs : Run! Mr. Pickles : Hark!

But the Boxtrolls did what Boxtrolls do They snatched him up and began to chew Until there was no residue Of Trubshaw. They pulled him down into their nest Hardly pausing to digest They left his bones but ate the rest Never be a dinner guest of Boxtrolls Crowd : Booooo! Eggs : But she’s lying Songs..of Boxtrollss... And that's the story of theTrubshaw kid Don't do what Father Trubshaw did If you see Boxtrolls don't placate them Catch 'em and exterminate them Hell no..Boxtrolls (Crowd Cheering) Madame Frou Frou :Kill those Boxtrolls! Crowd : Kill those boxtrolls! (Crowd Cheering) Lord Portley-Rind : Don’t forget about our party tonight, Frou Frou! Towns person : Oiiii!!! Winnie :What do you want! Egg : Arggghhh!!!

Come back here! And tell me everything! (Fish Whimpers) Mr. Gristle : Poke Mr. Pickles : You ever wonder what they’re thinkin’ ‘bout, Mr. Trout? Mr. Trout : I imagine they’re evaluating their life choices. Mr. Pickles : Ah! Wonderin’ why they chose to be evil, disgusting monsters instead of good guys like us! Snatcher : Wrong, Mr. Pickles! Snatcher : A boxtroll cannot choose a new life because a boxtroll does not aspire to be anything more than a weak, lowly pest. But a man - a great man! And his... Mr. Trout : Colleagues? Mr. Pickles : Best chums? Snatcher : stooges can choose to change their lives. Our dreams are in our grasp! Snatcher : Let us be dream-graspers, fates, destiny-takers! Let us grasp our dreams and shove them down everyone’s throat! Am I not right? Mr. Gristle : Throat! Snatcher : Yes! Snatcher : Now, gentlemen. What better way to dream than to walk in the shoes of those to whom we aspire? Mr. Pickles, fetch the... Mr. Pickles : Shoes Mr. Trout : Clogs? Mr. Gristle : Bat! Snatcher : Cheese. Mr. Trout : Oh no. Mr. Pickles : Oh dear. Mr. Gristle : Nice! Heh heh heh heh heh... Snatcher : Men, don your white hats. Mr. Pickles : Are you sure about this, boss? You know what cheese can do to you... Snatcher : Unless you are referring to how cheese brings men of respect and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what... "Cheese. Does. To. Me” Mr. Pickles : That’s what I meant then. Snatcher : Marvelous! Then let us begin. Snatcher : Enough! Snatcher : Mmmm! I say, old chaps, it’s quite, um... Quite- Mr. Trout : Aromatic? Okay? With an undertone of a mother’s smile on a warm spring day? Hmm... Snatcher : Yes! Those things! Etcetera etcetera, big words, chummy banter... Mr. Pickles : Someone’s got the cheese fits again. Mr. Trout : Ohhh... Mr. Trout : Quickly, quietly, get the leeches. Mr. Gristle : Quietly! Quietly! Snatcher : Where is he going? Is he getting more cheese? Mr. Pickles & Mr. Trout : Huh!!! Mr. Pickles : I think you’ve had enough for today, boss. Mr. Gristle : Quietly! Snatcher : What? Snatcher : Isn’t this nice? Chewing the cheddar with the big cheessses. Holding my own-­ With sssophissstication and sssavoir faire! Mr. Pickles : Yup. Nothing terrifying about that. Mr. Trout : Uh huh huh... Snatcher : Thisss is where I belong! Mr. Trout : Spot on, as always, sir. Mr. Pickles : You’re not wrong, boss. Snatcher : Well not here! In this rotten factory! I belong up there! Mr. Trout : I’m agreeing so I don’t upset you. Mr. Pickles : Very clever. Snatcher : In the tasting room, supping on the choicest cheeses... Everyone in town bowing down to me, like a gentleman, a lord with a White Hat! Eggs : Fish! Mr. Pickles : You’ve never been wrong, boss. Snatcher : It’s a time-honored tradition. Snatcher : Aaaarrgh! Mr. Trout : Now, now boss... Don’t get yourself all worked up. Mr. Pickles : Use your breathing. Snatcher : Stand back peasants! You don’t touch your King! Snatcher : King Archibald Snatcher; Yes, I shall be king too, why not? Mr. Trout : Stay with us, boss. Mr. Pickles : Tell us more about when you’ll be king. Snatcher : He won’t let me! That pompous Portley-Rind and his gaggle of giggling sycophants. Mr. Pickles : Now, now Boss, you be careful up there. Snatcher : Father always said if you worked hard, you’d get a white hat! And what did he ever get! Nothing! Eggs : Shussshhh Eggs : lets go Come on... come on.. Snatcher : I’m alright. Just give me a hand. Mr. Pickles : Ugh... Mother of sausages! Mr. Trout : Holy meat glove! Mr. Trout : Upsy daisy now, Boss. Let's get you a nice cuppa tea.. (Smacks Mr. Trout) Mr. Pickles : Aaaah! Mister Snatcher! Mr. Pickles : Portley Rind; Huh? What is it, Mr. Snatcher? Snatcher : You!!!! Mr. Pickles : Me? Snatcher : Give me that hat! Snatcher :I’ll make those brie stuffed pigs bow down to me! I’m going to be somebody! Mr. Pickles : Ahh! I got him! Do it! Mr. Trout : Mr. Gristle; Now! Mr. Pickles : Now! Now! Now!! Mr. Gristle : Leeches! Snatcher : Ahhhhh! Ugh. ouf. gahhh! Eggs : Eww! You have got to help me, Fish! Fish : (gurgles) Okay. Eggs : (groan) Uggggh. Snatcher : (groggy) Oh, hello. Where were we? Mr. Trout : We was about to... uhh... Mr. Gristle : Leeches. Mr. Trout : ... Put that new boxtroll to work. Ain’t that right, Mr. Pickles? Mr. Pickles : That is correct. Snatcher : Ah yes... right. Open the workshop Mr. Trout! (Gas Hissing, Gear Clanking) Snatcher : Huh? Where is the beast? Fish : Huh? Eggs : (gasps) But.. you’re all alive!? Oil Can : Eggs? Boxtroll Prisone : Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Mr. Pickles : There he is... Snatcher : It can’t be. It’s not possible. It’s not right! Mr. Pickles : That’s our boxtroll! Give ‘im back! Snatcher : Don’t stand there gawking. Get him! Mr. Gristle : Chase time! Snatcher : Mr. Trout! Fish : AHHHHHH! Snatcher : Ten years and now you show up?! Oil Can : Eggggs! Eggs : What are you doing with them? Snatcher : You’ll find out soon enough! Mr. Gristle : Up! I'm flying on the cage! Ha..ha..... Snatcher : Shoot Mr. Pickles! Shoot! Mr. Pickles : It’d be easier if he’d stop moving! Mr. Pickles : Stop moving! Mr. Pickles : Thank you. Eggs : Boxtrolls don’t hurt anyone! Let them go! Snatcher :Yes, well, I need them. They’re my ticket to a white hat, Trubshaw Baby! Winnie : Trubshaw Baby!? (Harpoon Fired) Winnie : I knew there was something strange about you! Mr. Pickles : (Chuckles) Snatcher : Miss Portley-Rind! What a surprise! Snatcher : Does your.. does your father know you’re here? Winnie : No of course not! But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive! Mr. Trout : Sorry, miss. Winnie : What are you doing? Unhand me! Snatcher : Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new victim, miss. And her name is YOU. Winnie : What have you dragged me into? Egg : Run Mr. Gristle : I’m swinging on a chain! Eggs & Winnie : AHHH! Mr. Pickles : Don’t make no sense. That’s evil prevailing over good. Snatcher : If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I’ve worked for! Mr. Trout : You mean, we worked for? Mr. Pickles : I think we’re all saying the same thing here. Mr. Trout : I don’t think we are. Snatcher : Barghhh Bah... Mr. Pickles : But, just in different ways. Winnie :(gasp) Ahhhhhhhhh! Winnie : Stay away from me! Someone, help!!! Wealthy girl in danger! (Winnie Screming) Winnie : If you’re going to eat me just get it over with. I’m sure I’m delicious. Winnie : Hmm? Fish : (Gurgling and excited hellos) Eggs : It’s not just us. All the others are alive too! Eggs : We saw them! Winnie : What’s going on?! Eggs : Oil Can, Wheels :, all of them! Specs : (GURGLES) Eggs : Yes! Clocks : (gurgled) Where are they? Eggs : I don’t know, but The Redhats have them building something in their factory. Winnie : I said what’s going on? Why aren’t they ripping out our eyeballs and eating our faces? Winnie : And where are the rivers of blood and mountains of bones?! I was promised mountains of bones!! Eggs : I told you, we don’t eat people! Winnie :Why do you keep saying “we”? You’re not one of them! You’re a boy! Eggs : No I’m not, I’m a boxtroll! Eggs; the boxtroll. Winnie :Oh really? Then let’s see you fit in your box. Eggs : I... I can’t right now. Winnie :Mm hmm. Eggs : I’m long-boned. Winnie : You don’t talk like them! Eggs : I- I have a speech impediment! Winnie : Your ears aren’t pointy! Eggs : I slept on them funny! Winnie :Oh for goodness sake. Give me your hand! Winnie : I don’t bite. Eggs : Hey! Winnie : You’re one of us. You’re a boy, Eggs; Or should I call you the Trubshaw baby? Eggs : It’s not true is it Fish? I’m a boxtroll like you, aren’t I? Fish : “No”. Winnie : See?! I was right! Now admit it, admit you stole him! Fish : Gurglegurglegurgle! Winnie : Is he confessing? Eggs : He says I was... given to him. Winnie :Ha, right again! I- ...wait, what? Eggs : I was given to you? Eggs : Who gave me to you? Fish : [GURGLE GURGLE] Winnie : What’s he saying? Eggs : Oh, sorry. He says a long time a go there was a kind man... Eggs : The one man in town who saw they weren’t monsters... (Baby Giggles) Eggs : But builders... like him. Herbert : I’ve tried adjusting the dongle and there doesn’t seem to be any possible solut... Oh look, you’ve solved it! Herbert : Who’s up for a jelly break? Herbert : I tell you I could eat this stuff for the rest of my life. Egg : But one night... Snatcher : Come on! I’m being reasonable. I can be unreasonable. Eggs : Snatcher wanted him to build something....But he refused... Herbert : I-- I’m an inventor, not a killer! Eggs : And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him... Snatcher : Maybe if I hold on to your son... Herbert : Not my boy! Herbert : Run! Take my son... (Baby Crying) Eggs : And then they... Winnie : They what? Eggs : They killed him. Winnie :I think that kind man was your father. Eggs : What’s a father? Winnie :Um... well... a father is the one who raises you... looks after you... Loves you... Eggs : Oh! Like Fish.... Winnie : Yes... Winnie : No. They’re supposed to be like that man in the story. Someone who’ll do anything to help you. They always listen and never get angry... Winnie : They guide you when you don’t know what to do. They’re there when it’s dark and you’re scared or lonely, and they are never, ever too busy to talk to you... Eggs : You have a father! We can tell him I’m the Trubshaw Baby... and the boxtrolls didn’t eat me. And he’ll stop Snatcher! Winnie :Well, he doesn’t really listen to children. Eggs : He’s a father, isn’t he? Winnie :You don’t know what he’s like. Eggs : But he’s the only father we have Eggs : Please help us. Winnie : If I agree to help, you have to do exactly as I say. Eggs : I promise! Winnie :All right, first thing’s first... off with the box. Boxtrolls terrified : AAAAAAAAh! Winnie : Stop that! Alright, you petty thieves. Bring me your loot! Oh, thanks. No. This might work. No (Growls) Oh yes! No! Yes! Winnie : You look like a proper boy Eggs : Me... a proper boy. Winnie : How do we get out of this place? Winnie : AHHHHHHHH! Winnie : Come on Eggs Winnie : STOP! You don’t scratch there in public! That’s why they’re called... (whispered)... privates. Eggs : (whispered) Okay Winnie : For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands. Winnie : What are you doing?! Put those down! Like this. Winnie : The other one. Eggs : Oh, right. Winnie :Then you say, “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Eggs : “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Winnie : And you say that even if you’re not pleased to meet them. Winnie : Just stick close, okay? Eggs : Which one is your father? Winnie : Lord Portley-Rind He’s usually making speeches about cheese. Lady Cyhthia : Oh, Winifred! Winnie : Hello, mommy dear. Lady Cyhthia : Oh. Who is this?

Lord Portley-Rind : There, there. You poor, poor dear. Winnie : Eggs, wait! Eggs : You said fathers were supposed to help. That they took care of kids. Winnie :(sigh) Well, they’re supposed to. Eggs : People are just mean and selfish. They’re monsters Winnie : Not all of us. You aren’t. Eggs : Well, I don’t want to be a boy anymore. Eggs : It was a pleasure meeting you. Winnie : Eggs... Eggs : And, Winnie I really do mean it. BOXTROLLS : Eggs! Eggs : We have to leave the cavern. (The boxtrolls stop drumming) Eggs : We’re not safe down here anymore. Come on...

Snatcher : Trubshaw senior loved his kid, same as regular faaaaathers did.... Eggs : He’s my, you’re my... are you my father? Herbert : JELLY! Snatcher : He was once. Won’t get much out of him now, though. A decade hanging upside down scrambled his noodles good. Snatcher : Still, did a fine job designing this beauty. Best inventor in town, your dad. Working with the best little builders. Eggs : No, no no, don’t hide. Fish! Shoe! RUN! Get up, get up and run! Sparky. Sweets, run! Snatcher :Yell all you want, boy. They ain’t gonna run.

Self-imposed metamorphosis. Boxboy! You did it! Eggs : I don’t understand. Herbert : You changed your nature. Tell them. Eggs : I tried. They won’t listen. Herbert You did it. You made you.

(laughs) Eggs : Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They’re crushed. Mr. Trout : Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded. Snatcher : All.... but.... one.... Snatcher : Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, come out of your homes! The curfew has been lifted! Townsfolk Boy : Whoah! What is it? Snatcher : Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished!

Lord Portley-Rind : Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this? Snatcher : Show him lads. Snatcher : Flattened to extinction. Every last, slimy one of them. Snatcher : Your lordship, I said I would not rest until I caught every last boxtroll and I am a man of my word Snatcher : With this boxtroll, I will end their reign of terror. Winnie : Eggs! Snatcher : I’d say that deserves a white hat, don’t you? Shopkeeper Women : A.. A white hat for Mr. Snatcher ! Lord Portley-Rind : Yes, well. I’m not sure... We’d have to take a vote... (Crowd in unison, chanting) WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! Lord Portley-Rind : There’s probably some, uh, paperwork... then have a hat shipped in... Snatcher :No. Me thinks a deed of this magnitude deserves something a bit more... significant. Snatcher : I want YOUR hat. Lord Portley-Rind : My hat? (Crowd in unison, chanting) WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! Lord Portley-Rind : All right. All right. As soon as that boxtroll is dead, you may have... my... hat. Snatcher : Yes. And then we can eat cheese together. In the Tasting Room. Snatcher : Do the honors. Mr. Pickles : I thought this was all gonna be a show, like with Frou Frou. I brought my mustache and everything. Mr. Trout : This really does stretch the limits of the term “hero”, doesn’t it? Mr. Gristle : HAT! (CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY) Snatcher : Musician, drum-roll! Snatcher : Mr. Trout! Lower the beast down. Lord Portley-Rind : Repeat after me: With this hat, I, state your name... Snatcher : With this hat, I, Archibald Penelope Snatcher Snatcher : Proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat. Winnie : Father! Father! Lord Portley-Rind : Not now, Winifred! Winnie : STOP! STOP! Mr. Trout : I can’t, miss. Apologies. Mr. Pickles : We’re just doing our jobs. Winnie :Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?! Mr. Pickles : I knew that’s how people saw us. Winnie :You don’t have to do this! Mr. Trout : She has a point, Mr. Pickles,This could be our chance for redemption. Mr. Pickles : A second chapter! Mr. Trout : People love a flawed hero! Winnie : Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him go!

Eggs : You got out of your boxes! You did it! Workman : The boy is friends with a boxtroll?! Shopkeeper Lady : But boxtrolls are monsters. Winnie :Boxtrolls aren’t monsters. They never ate the Trubshaw Baby, he’s right there with Fish and (GASPS) Eggs : My father. Winnie : Your father? Herbert : Look what you did. Eggs : You were right. Thank you. (Crow Chatting) Herbert Trubshaw? The inventor? Alive? Oh get out of here. Snatcher said he was killed. How can that be? How is this possible? He lied to us? Snatcher lied! Lord Portley-Rind : He lied to us and to poor Madame Frou Frou! Lord Portley-Rind : Snatcher! Snatcher : We could've been somezing special, but you've broken our agreement.
