There they go, all hot and bothered. Now let's see Matt Ribbon with the black old panther and our leader Matt Sticka from back on the river. But Haynie's Blue is back from the ranks. (engines rumbling) And if you're really ready, let it happen! - Go! - [Announcer] Oh and Rupert in there sagging off the lead from old spotted Farmer San Tromeno. Oh no, don't wanna let him go so easy Jack, oh ho. - Get your Tweety Birds here, get Tweety Birds here. Tweety Birds, get your Tweety Birds here. - Can I have a Tweety Bird? - No. - [Announcer] Happy Halloween at the first race session of the Huckleberry Hodown, there's Bobby River in that old T-66 in that double-rumble seater. It's a seven county scuba heater, he's the winner once he lets him overdo it every Sunday, Monday. - You see, I said it was too crowded. Didn't I say it was too crowded? - You said, you said. Darlene, sit down so you won't make a spectacle. (crowd gasps) (sirens blaring) - [Darlene] Oh my God. - [Announcer] See if there's any blood on the track. Don't go away, it looks okay. - Did you see that? - I'm not impressed by reckless driving. (relaxed violin, guitar music) - Hear that sound, a figure eight. - Missed call, sound of the midgets. Figure eight sounds more like (deep rumbling). - Seriously Hoover, you're crazy. - Don't you think we oughta finish the route first? I mean my father's in here, you know. - Yeah, your father argues with himself in the bathroom. - About what? - About peace. About time, ba-da-flu, let's go buckaroos. - I don't know how I'm supposed to smuggle all you clowns in there without losing this job. - We are employees of good old Mandolin. - Yeah well who's gonna believe a BS story like that, huh? - Come on, let's boogie. - Hey, Hoover isn't crazy. - Yes he is. - No he's not. He's just neurotic. - Yeah yeah yeah, right. (women whispering, gossiping) Hey thanks for all your help. Mandolin's House Service. - Lallie, Miranda, how you doing? - [Lallie] Oh, I'm great. - I think there's a bug going around. - Hey Jake. - Your old man's in there. - Yeah thanks, I already saw him. (tepid trumpet tones) - [Announcer] All the rest in that order and the winner is Harvey Cornspan in a Datsun. (crowd cheering) I see we have Sheriff Niebold with us today. - [Deputy] What's the matter, you smell a suspect? - Yeah, my son Hoover. - [Announcer] Bam, fast, here he comes past our champ with a sweet bye-and-bye and still looking for the rest. The one, the two, the three bow-winder from Kentucky are hankering to take home the bacon today. All praise to Big Bubba Jones. Four series, four series. (tepid trumpet tones) Keep your trap shut brother or you'll leave, there they go. (engines rumbling) It's best if you get out front. It's Flapjack Flaps and Bernie Miller fightin' it out for the lead with little old Lolita in that fast seven-11 car and Big Bubba Jones seems to be laying back and waiting for the right time to pursue. (cheering) That's Bubba moving up to fourth, he won't make it there for long either. Heavens folks, they're only in mud. I think I saw something that looked like a beer can flying through the mud spots, friend. These old boys, there goes Bubba stealing third. That was a popular move. Lucky Lou staring Bubba Jones down the back. - Hey Darlene, what you got inside them short shorts? - [Hoover] Shut up, stupid. - Hi Mrs. Kurtz, Mr. Kurt-- - Gross. - [Announcer] Behind the red sunset where the wheels are nearly burning in the burroughs, it's really early and it's one, two, three, four, five, five left in the running. (tires screeching) And off rolls number five with the twitch of a bumper. Big Bubba Jones, Big Bubba Jones. He's back where he was before but I just love saying Big Bubba Jones. There goes the old shark. Folks says he can beat your draws if you consider the inference they're making. And here we go again, all slap and happy. All right. DDT right, speeds down the outside of RCA. But that's the way it was wrote on the outhouse wall, Earl. Bubba's just won money against some of the best three teams on the national circuit. Bubba's just passed Gord Ferry and he's on his way past number 12. Oh, they're starting to come in a bit. - Hoover. - Hi there, dad. - Don't you give me that. - What? - Did you change the towels at the Exxon over on Magnolia? - Yeah yeah, sure. - What time? Pay attention to me. - 8:07. - Look at me when you're talking to me. Now what time were you at the Exxon? - I told you dad, 9:07. - 9:07, huh? Well what time did you change the towels at the Sheriffs Office? - Between 9:16 and 9:22. - Oh yeah? Well how did you get from the Exxon to the Sheriffs Office in nine minutes without gettin' a speeding ticket, huh? (laughs) What's so funny? Oh, it just makes me sick to see grown men laugh at something like that. You know when you laugh, it just encourages him to do more of the same. How the hell do you expect to control your kids? - I don't know Harry, how do you do it? - Harry, it's your kid. - You oughta tell us, Harry. - That's it! One more word and you're under arrest. - [Concessionaire] Get your popcorn right here, here. - [Announcer] Cords of the old Long Island Broomsticks and that goes for the others too. At 46 years old, Big Bubba Jones pops back over the hill. Going through the back like Ex-Lax and the checkered flag comes down on Big Bubba Jones. It was a hard-earned easy victory for Jones, that good old boy. - I'm gonna go get a hot dog. - Darlene? - What? - Did you not ask us if we want something? - Do you want something? - No thank you. - Bring me please, and you see I say please, a box of buttered popcorn and some lemonade or something, ya? - Yeah. - Thank you. (whistle blowing) (triumphant trombone music) - He says he called me Hoover 'cause I put him into a depression. That's the only funny thing I ever heard him say. - Who? - My father, you know the law. - Oh, do you go to the ladies john too? - Oh yeah sure, only when nobody's looking. Hey listen, are you still going with that Harold Bates? - What's that to you? - Well, I was just wondering, that's all, well I just-- - Hey Hoover. I've still got those towel rolls, can I just chuck 'em? - Yeah sure go ahead, we're done. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry. Hey Miranda, Miranda-- - Could I have a hotdog? - Did you see Darlene? - And, let's see. Oh, a cotton candy and-- - Darlene. - Two lemon-lime drinks. - Darlene? - And wait a minute, no make that Coke okay? - Darlene, I was just-- - And I'd like a cotton candy. - That's it, Hoover. - Maybe we oughta wait 'til the line thins out a little. - Who, me? - Well yeah, I thought you know, why not? - A girl's gotta watch out who she's seen associating with. - What do you mean? - You are Hoover Niebold, right? - Wait a minute. Just because I got a stupid name, it doesn't mean I'm not worth going with. You oughta try me. I mean look, what do you got to lose? - My self-respect. - Yeah, well maybe. But now listen to this, you never know right? I might turn out to be a very interesting character. - Would I go out with a guy whose father's a cop? - Good point. Good point, we could always have him bumped off. - Hey, you'd do that for me? - Sure, hell yes. Well you know, I mean you know, I didn't mean... - Look kid, if you're such a novelty, what makes you so different? - Well, I get more speeding tickets than anybody else in the county and I can-- - Take me for a ride? - What? - Oh, forget it. - No wait a minute, you said you wanted to go for a ride. - Only if you're as fast as you say you are. - I am, listen I got my truck outside, it's right out front. - Oh really? - Yeah. - I offer you the best chance you've had in your life and you offer me a ride in a truck? - Yeah all right, okay. Just gimme a minute to think, all right? - I don't wanna ride in just any car. I wanna ride in that car. - [Hoover] Which one? - That one. (triumphant trumpet music) - [Elmer] Perfect. - Double-D-goddamn right she's perfect. Cost me my la-la-pa-lamented life savings. - Yeah, I know. (light humming) Throw in another can? - No, that's fine. All we have to do is get her on and off the truck a few times. Why don't you pack up the spares? - Okay. - Pretty, ain't she boy? - Yeah. - You're goddamn right she is. - You still using that engine from Darlington? - Hell no, best damn engine this side of some hubble- bubble submarine but only if you use it for just one race. Yeah, I dropped that one smack in the middle of the Mississippi. Anyhow, this new one's better. Hotter than a yeast in a whorehouse. Here? - Yeah, thanks. You know, I don't know anybody else who puts everything he wins back into his car. - Keeps me winning. Gimme a hand here, will you boy? - Sure. Hey, you didn't change your rear end did you? I mean it's still 613s right? - Hey boy, how long you been spying on me? - Oh no no, I never, see I just read a lot of stock car and hot rod magazines and stuff. I read 'em all. - Hey boy, those magazines are all full of bal-double-D-goddamn-loney. - That's what my father says. - Yeah, he a driver? - No. No he's, he's a Sheriff. (sputtering, laughing) - You gonna follow in your daddy's flip flops, are ya? - Dick that. I'm gonna be a race driver. - Uh-oh, that's what they all say. Boy, that is what they all say. You let Big Bubba give you a piece of advice. The best way to see a race is from right up there in them blankety-blank bleachers. - [Elmer] Hey Bubba, the truck's broken. - What say, Elmer? - The truck's broke. - Oh shit on a stick. Here boy hold this, I got more trouble. (engine revving) Ah, that's Mabel. (relaxed ensemble band music) (screaming) (engine rumbling) - [Harry] Hey look! - That's Hoover Niebold.

Let me speak to Charlie. - All units, this is Harry to all units. - Hey Charlie, we've got a flat for you, yeah I'll hold on. - Listen, I've got a hunch. I think the kids have run out of gas. So I want you to check all the filling stations, see if they've been in there and if they do come in, tell 'em to call me right away, over and out. - You ain't gonna catch 'em, Harry. - You stop calling me Harry. - 10 seconds, Harry. - [Townsman] Hey, you guys wanna play some poker? What was that? - [Radio Reporter] Stand by for a bulletin from the Sheriff of Puckerbush County, Harry Niebold. - [Harry] I'm addressing this ultimatum to Hoover Niebold, no son of mine whom it seems has seen fit to abscond with and is currently in possession-- Hoover, if you can hear me I want to let you know just a few of the charges that have so far-- - We ain't got no oats. - [Hoover] I wanna fill up these milk cans. - What cha gonna do, feed it to the pigs and chickens? - No, my grandma drinks it. - Destruction of patrol car-- - Well do you want regular lead, regular no lead, ethyl lead or ethyl no lead?

Shock and injury to one patient. Malicious destruction of the Hale Farm. - You all right? - Hey Deputy. - You seen any sign of a stock car? A pumpkin colored thing with a big number eight painted on the side. - I never seen no race. - The driver's a big bony kid with a real dumb face and he's wearing a blue windbreaker with hot rod patches all over it and a Civil War toy soldier hat. - [Harry] These crimes out of common criminal-- - No, never seen anybody like that in my whole life. - He's got a girl with him, kind of a sensuous number in yellow hot pants. - [Harry] Before it starts. - Well if you see him or if he comes in here for gas, you call the Sheriffs Office right away, you hear? - I surely will, especially if I see that there girl. - [Deputy] All right, Roy. - [Harry] In carefree disregard of life, limb or property. Too late, I should've-- - Nice day, huh? - Never taught you to drive. Then I should've had you committed to a muddy camp so that your foot could never touch a pedal or your hand a gear shift knob. - Well I wouldn't go to State. - Yeah, the basketball team's too short. - I don't care about that. It's just that you're not allowed to have roommates, of the opposite sex I mean. - Yes you can. - No you can't. - Well, it's 86% male at State. - Yeah but they all look like deuce. - Who cares what they look like? It's the action that counts. - I care what they look like. I want nothing but the best, the creme de la creeps right? - Then how come you're going with Hoover? - Going with Hoover? You want my breakfast over the phone. - No thanks. - I'm not going with Hoover. He's just taking me for a little ride. - Or vicey-versey, which is worsey. - Mercy, mercy. Look, have you seen your folks yet? - [Harry] And feeding it, still connected to your worthless guts to Mrs. Kimberley's cats. How's that? - Damn fine, Harry. - Great! - You don't think I was too rough or anything, now do you? - No, no. - You were what was called cool. - [Harry] Good, and you think it'll bring him in right? - No. - You want me to call the boys, Harry? - Yeah. (horse neighing) - $32.68. - Yeah. Listen, you know I think I might have the 68 cents. Have you got a pen there? - Yeah. I think so. - Yeah, 50, 55, right. Listen, you got a 20? - We'll see. One, two, yeah. Two 10s, three 10s. - Yeah. - 10, 20, here. 30. - Right. Okay so, yeah here's the two dollars and 68 cents. - Get on ahead. Take it easy buddy. - Yeah, same to you. - Yeah well we the onliest ones to do it. Okay, see you in about 10 minutes, hold on. - Are you sure you know what you're gonna say? - Yeah, I think so. - All right, you push that button right there. - You must forgive Dorrit, she's a little nervous. It's her first time in the Sheriff's Office. - Hello, hello Darlene? - You tell him I will buy him all the beer he will drink after we catch them double-goddamn kids, all right? - Yoo hoo Darlene, are you there? - [Dorrit] This is on the radio, your mama and papa. - [Willie] we want for you to know we love you and want for you to come home. - [Dorrit] Ya, right away now. - [Willie] Otherwise we think that maybe you don't love and what we're trying to tell you. - [Dorrit] You wouldn't forget that we always give up our own pleasure so that-- (upbeat country guitar music) - [Horsewoman] Wow, baby. - [Driver] Woo hoo, yeah ha ha. Come on man. - Bye. (relaxed guitar music) - It's all right, it's all right, yahoo! - Out of our way, fellas. - They're coming. - [Driver] We're gonna catch them, don't worry about it. - Chief sir, they all look drunk. - We'll book 'em for it later. - They all drive better drunk anyway. - All right, let's move it out. Well move for Christ sakes! - This vehicle does not seem to possess a functioning door handle. - What does it seem to possess? - Woo wee, I guess I'll loop the boop with the troop. - Oh my god. - Don't come back without 'em. - Don't come back! - You all had better come back. - Did you do that? - What? - You touched me upon the posterior. - Beep beep. - William, come back here you goddamn miscreant. - [Clark] I'll hold the fort. (hooves clattering) (relaxed violin, guitar music) - Put the gas in the tank first. (horse neighing) You know the funny thing is I never liked Marilyn Becker. - [Hoover] Well we'll have to thank her sometime. - Yeah. - If we ever have a chance. - What do you mean? - [Hoover] Didn't you hear my father on the radio? - Oh yeah, he's gonna eat your liver or something right? - Yeah, feed it to the cats. But really it's just all the charges against us, I mean if they ever catch us we're gonna go to jail for about 1,000 years. - Oh, really? - [Hoover] So, I don't know if we're ever gonna be able to go back. Did you hear what I said? I said we wouldn't be able to go back. - I don't care, I don't want to. I want to go on forever. - Well, I guess it's just you and me, Darlene. I don't know what's gonna happen. I guess you'd rather be with somebody else. I mean I got these ears. My father makes me keep my hair all chopped off. I could let it grow now. But you probably wouldn't want... Oh oh, Darlene. - Hi. (rooster crowing) (up tempo scratching electronic tones) (engines rumbling) (light up tempo drumbeat) - Well baby, they're closing in. - Yeah, we better split. - Right away? - Well, pretty soon. (metallic clattering) - [Deputy] I don't think I like this. - We just gonna walk into GI Jackson's? - Why not, he won't shoot the Sheriff, or you. (gunfire clattering) - [Darlene] Okay, which one do you like huh? - Well-- - This one or this one? - Yeah, just put something on, we gotta go. - Don't you even care what I look like? - You look fine, let's get going. - Okay then I'll go the way I am. - Will you come on? (anxious light up tempo drumbeat) - That sure is some flat. - I'm gonna put the collar on you, I'm gonna put the collar on you for drunk driving, you pathetic son of a bitch. - [Bud] That sure is some flat. - Well change it, there's a spare right here. - I'm sorry old buddy, my tools are on the truck. Maybe there's some there in that stable, stable. Hey Chris. - What? - It's Mabel. (anxious low violin, guitar music) - Stay right here. - What was I looking for? That's it, beer. - There's good news tonight, calling Sheriff Niebold, come in. Come in, Harry. - Will you get outta the road? - [Chris] I found it Harry, I found the car. - Keep your hands to yourself. - That wasn't me. - Well where are the kids? - I don't know, didn't see em. - [Harry] Why'd you leave the car unguarded? - Bud's watching it and I came to find you. - Oh get it, get in. - Follow me, right this way. (up tempo anxious violin, guitar music) - What the hell is that? - [Chris] It's the car, Harry. (engine rumbling) - Hoover! - Hi dad! - Bye bye, dad. (gunshot booms) (shouting) - What happened? - Ah, shut up. Come on in.

(anxious mid tempo guitar, violin music) You're gettin' on there old buddy, that's good. - Hey, could I talk to the other drivers on this thing? - Sure, all you gotta do is push that button on the wheel. - Okay, as soon as I think about something to say. - Hi fellas. - Hey yourself. (chattering, overlapping voices) (engine rumbling) - Give me the goddamn beer for Christ's sake. - [Deputy] Hey, that's littering. - That's code 13 of Municipal Code Disposal-- - Oh, will you shut up for Christ's sake? Push that button down. - Push that button down. (drunken singing) - How the hell did I end up with you? Shut up, you're on duty. (up tempo country guitar, violin music) (laughing) (engine rumbling) - Oh my god. This is really, jeez. (up tempo country guitar, violin music) - Hail six Bubba, kid wanna talk to you. Gee, I just want to say bring this car back in one piece and I won't bust none of your bones now, you hear? - Stick it in your ear. - [Harry] Hoover, can you hear me? - I hear you pappy but I can't quite reach you. (tires screeching) (up tempo guitar, violin music) - Oh my god, my back. (engines rumbling) Keep up with him. - [Deputy] I hesitate to bring this to your attention Sheriff but couldn't this vehicle contain an illegal number of passengers? - What's so goddamn funny, come on now. Pay attention to what you're doing. Hey, you wanna pay attention to what you're doing? - [Driver] We gotta get somebody up alongside so somebody can cut underneath and somebody can cut the son of a bitch off. - [Driver] Shit we got him now, there ain't no way off this road. - [Driver] Looks like he's moving pretty fast to me. - [Driver] I hope I don't see any oncoming traffic. - That boy is in big trouble, I'll tell ya that. I've got news for you, when this is over, I'm gonna have a whole bunch of new Deputies, a whole bunch. - [Driver] Who are you racing with, him or me? - [Driver] Oh, I shouldn't have had that last beer. - [Driver] I wish I'd had another one. - [Driver] I wish you'd get your beer can out from under my feet. It's stuck. (engine rumbling) - [Bubba] Let me give you some advice. Boy, you ain't got a double-D-goddamn chance against these old boys, why don't you just give up? - Ask my father. - [Bubba] What in holy hollerin' hell he got to do with it? - Oh nothing, he just wants to send me to jail for life, fine me a million dollars and feed my guts to the cats. - [Bubba] Oh, he wouldn't do that. No, I'll eat 'em myself. - All right, you boys keep-- - Goddamn kid. Okay, I think you got him now. Now you just do what I say. Hey yeah, here he comes. Just stay in there next to the birch. Go ahead. - Won't he try and go high and nick under me when I come out of it? - Oh shit no boy, he ain't got the poop. (engine rumbling) - Thanks a heap. - Wait. (tires screeching) Put it in reverse. - [Driver] Did you see that? - [Driver] Shit, this is really bad. - [Driver] By god, did you see that? - [Darlene] Oh no, no. Oh no. - Woo, that feels good. - Hoover, hear me now, the only reason you won't give yourself up is 'cause you're scared of me. - No, just what you said you were gonna to do me. - Oh Jesus Christ, don't you have any guts? - Yeah and I wanna keep 'em. So much goddamn water. (up tempo guitar, violin music) (engine rumbling) (light up tempo drumbeat) (high-pitched whistling) - Where's he going? Don't go up there, son. Mabel can't make it. - She's trying. - Have a beer. (up tempo guitar, violin music) - Watch that curve, watch that curve. (tires screeching) - [Driver] Where the hell do they think they're going? - This is so bitching. - Hey kid take it easy, they think they're coming on us. - You can always get out. - We'll get 'em scared shitless. - Yeah, he's gonna kill himself and us too. Hoover, this is your father speaking in the capacity of the Sheriff. ♪ I shot the Sheriff ♪ - I'm all ears. - We're gonna have you boxed in in just a minute. Now it's gonna hit the fan and you better give yourself up now and make it easier on yourself. - What about the kids? - You're stalling. - What about Darlene? - Oh for Christ's sake, what have you done to her? - Nothing you didn't teach me, dad. (up tempo country guitar music) - Oh god. - Right there! - They got us. - Well go over the cliff. - [Harry] Just slow 'em down and stop 'em. - We'd probably get killed. - I thought you loved me. - You wanna give 'em a ticket? - No. I want to give you a concussion. - You mean if I love you, I'll go over the cliff and make sure you don't get killed? - Well do you think you can do it? - You're not stopping. - No, I'm holy. - Well I guess if you don't get killed, we won't, will we bud? - Ah shit. Get out the car. - Hang onto your hat. - I haven't got a hat. - [Hoover] Well hang onto something. (Darlene screams) - Oh Jesus Christ, that'll kill them. - All right. All right. (shouting) (groaning) (high-pitched screaming) - [Driver] Oh no, no. (tires screeching) - [Driver] Yahoo! Ha ha! - My god, I killed 'em. - All right, Hoover. Let's talk. - [Deputy] Get your boot out of my face. - What's the deal? - I don't know. Say two years and 80% of your salary until everything is paid for. (drivers, deputies groaning) - Okay Mabel, let's see if you still got it. (engine rumbling) - Oh no, not again. - [Driver] Come on, gimme a push with that car. - [Harry] All right son, this is my final offer. Probation and 30% of your salary. If I tried to do any more than that, I'd have to resign. - [Deputy] Oh, you'll have to resign anyway Harry. - Yeah, the jig's up. - Oh yeah, you're finished. - Shut up, will ya? - 30% of what? - [Deputy] Yeah, who'd give that punk a job? - I wouldn't. - That's it shithead. You're fired. - You can't fire us. We quit. - We quit. - [Bubba] Shoot Sheriff, the kid's won. He could get a ride on any Double-D- goddamn short track in the country. (relaxed guitar music) - [Hoover] Is the ride over? - [Darlene] That's up to you. (townsfolk shouting) - [Townsman] Where are you going? Come back here. Hoover! - Hey, you made it. - [Townswoman] Where are they going? No, no, where are they going? - [Townsman] Stay right here, you hear me? Stay here. Do not go over there. (relaxed guitar, violin music) (kids cheering) (dog barking) (relaxed guitar, violin music) - Not bad. - Yeah. It looks different at night. Spooky. - Yeah. Well it's supposed to be. I mean it's Halloween you know. - Help me out. Thanks Hoover, it was a trip. Bye. - Hey you know, I'm letting it grow. - What? - My hair. It's getting longer already, I can feel it. - You shouldn't bother. - Why not? - Like you said Hoover, the ride's over. Goodnight. - It wasn't me at all, was it? It was just the car. - Boy. Now that ain't no way to treat a lady. Get in. This side, boy. Well, start her up. (engine rumbling) Take her out on the track.
