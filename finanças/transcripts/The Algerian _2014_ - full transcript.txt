Panetta said that, quote, "Terrorists should be on notice "that they will find no sanctuary, no refuge, "not in Algeria, not in North Africa, not anywhere." Repercussions from the Arab Spring continue to affect the Middle East and beyond.

The flight was good. - Be careful, Ali. - Yes, I know, I will. - Stay in touch. - I'll call you soon, okay? - Take care of yourself, okay? - Okay. [store bell tinkles] Hi. - Can I help you, sir? - Yes, I'm looking for a good bike I could ride everyday but isn't too expensive. - How much do you want to spend? - The best bike for the best price. - Oh. I have a bicycle inside. I'll get it for you, okay, just wait a minute. This bicycle over here. I fixed it for someone who never came to pick it up, so I'm stuck with it right now. I'll sell it to you for cost. - How much? - $100 dollars. - You have a deal. - Oh, okay. Okay. Credit or cash? - Cash. - Cash? - Yes. - Okay. So, where are you from, if you don't mind me asking? - Algeria. - Ohh.

You speak good English. - Thank you. - Welcome to America. A young man like you will love it over here. - I hope so. - Yes. Funny, isn't it, huh? - What's that? - You move halfway across the world to change everything, and the first thing you change is your name. I did the same thing. - Thanks for the deal.

[speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful exotic music] [upbeat exotic music] [knocking] [ominous music] - It wasn't until the visionary Pope Urban II gathered a council at Clermont in 1095 that the fragmented Medieval world of Europe would finally find internal stability and unite under a single purpose. That purpose was to launch a massive attack on the Middle East and capture the Holy City of Jerusalem for Christianity. The Pope re-focused that power and built the largest military machine since the fall of Rome, and thus was born the First Crusade. [muffled shouting] [somber instrumental music] [birds chirping] [speaking in foreign language] [soft instrumental music] [muffled shouting] [huffing] [praying in foreign language] [upbeat exotic music] - They told me you speak excellent English. - I studied at The American University in Cairo. - Do you know who call me Father? - Yes, those who whisper your teaching from Morocco to Afghanistan. - My followers are waiting for me, a sign to start the revolution. - That's why I'm here. - They told me that you are doing well. - I'm studying engineering, like my father. - I knew your father. I was a young man listening to his teaching 20 years ago. They killed him 'cause he was a threat. He wanted change. Ali, what are your thoughts about your Muslim brothers? - I believe our Muslim brothers should be united under the band of [speaking in foreign language]. Under one nation, we can be even greater than the United States, given the right opportunity. - I will provide that opportunity, but, are you ready to face the path that lies ahead of you? - I am ready. - Your father was my teacher. Now, I will be your teacher and you will get your revenge. From this day forth, you're no longer an orphan. And you will call me Father. - Thank you, Father. - Go get some rest. Tomorrow your training will begin. Brother will show you to your room. Brother is my greatest student. I found him in Afghanistan. - [Father] He was an American soldier but now he fights for me. He will teach you what you need to know.

Keep it movin'. - Don't be a bitch! - Ahh! - Hey, you're comin' with us. - Fuck that. No, she's not. She ain't worth this. - He's right, it's not worth it, so why don't you just go home and fuck your boyfriend and we'll all be happier for it. - Fuck you, bitch! [crowd gasps] [thudding] Come on, what? [whacking] [thudding] Motherfucker! [grunting] [banging] - [laughs] Who's the bitch now? - I got him. - It's not our battle. - That's what you get for puttin' your motherfuckin' hands on a lady. - Bitch, yeah. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - You two should get goin'. ♪ Try as I might [soft guitar music] - [Ali] You okay? - Mm-hm. Why would a guy like you help a girl like me? - A man who hits a woman is no better than an animal where I come from. - Where's that? - Where's what? - Where you're from. - Algiers. - Oh. Is that in Europe or something? - Close. North Africa. - Africa? No, no, no, you don't, you don't look like a brother to me. [laughs] - Africa is a big place. - You have really sweet eyes. - So do you. [bell dings] - Can I get another iced tea please? - Sure. - I forgot to duck, yeah. - Can I get you anything else? - We're okay for now, thanks. - Here's the check. - Thank you. You've been so amazing. - Whenever you're ready. - Yeah, really. Ew. I kinda hate her. Sorry. [laughs] - So where are you from? LA? - Do I look like an LA girl to you? - I wouldn't know. I just got here a few months ago. - I'm from the Bronx. - Is that far from here? - Yes, it's on the other fuckin' side of the country. It's in New York. You are new. - I'm a fast learner. - Mm-hm. - So do you like it here? - Not really. - So if you don't like it here, why don't you go back? - Well, I just needed to get away for a little while. - How long have you been away for? - 10 years. - Wow. That's a long time. - It was. Is. - So who was that guy back there anyway? Is he your boyfriend? - No, he is not my boyfriend. He is just some guy that can't take no for an answer. - Oh. - That's all. - I see. - Okay, my turn, Superman. Where'd you learn to fight like that? I mean, I've seen a lot of tough guys growing up from where I'm from, and I've never seen shit like that before. - Just something I picked up here and there. - You just, you just pick that kinda stuff up? - Mm-hm. - Hm. I liked it. - I gotta get up early tomorrow morning. - Okay. - Let's go? - Sure. - All right. [soft guitar music] ♪ Hopelessly romantic - Wait.

[laughs] [speaks in foreign language] Allah is truly magnificent to create such beauty for us. - Yes, he is. - I'm Suleyman. - Al. I mean, Ali. Nice to meet you. - Where you from, Ali? It's okay, you don't have to answer. - It's not that, it's just, I've never met an American Muslim before. - Lots of us, all shapes, sizes, colors, white, black, yellow, you name it. Allah loves diversity. - Yes, he does. To answer your question, I'm from Algeria. - North Africa? You're a long way from home. - Just got here a few months ago, for university. - Oh, that's great. Education is a divine gift. What university? - LAU. - That's wonderful. You must have prayed at our mosque. [speaking in foreign language] I'm an Imam there. It's just a few blocks away from your school. - I'm not going to mosque right now. I need some time for myself. I pray alone. - Oh, I see. That could be a good thing in a young man, for a time. But eventually, he'll have to rejoin his brothers in prayer. - Thank you. I'll try to come by one day. - You know, when you change your mind, I'll be expecting you. - Thanks, I have to go. [speaking in foreign language] [somber guitar music] - Do you know why you are here? Hiding in the desert like scared children. Do you know that the Middle East population have the highest growth rate in the world? In 20 years, there will be close to 600 million of us. 50% of all Saudia Arabia is under the age of 15. In Iran, 65% is under the age of 25. And here in Algeria, 70% of our brothers and sisters, they're under the age of 30. Do you understand what that means? Already the youth have spoken and the smell of freedom is floating in the air just like a desert rose, spreading. - Factors that led up to the colliding worlds of Europe and North Africa via Rome and Carthage. In the end, Rome was victorious and the Carthaginians were virtually erased from history. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, go ahead. - What about the Phoenicians? - Phoenicians? - What about them? - You said the Carthaginians were virtually erased from history. - Yes, and? - Well, I think it's important to note that the Carthaginians and thus the Berbers are descendants of the Phoenicians. - Well, the Phoenician connection to the Berbers is still in somewhat of a historical dispute. - There is nothing to dispute here, sir. Berbers are descendants of the Phoenicians. - Well, young man, tell me what makes you so sure. - Because I'm Berber. [speaks in foreign language] That's the first thing every Berber child learns to say. - Well, I'm sorry, I don't speak Berber. - Obviously. [students chuckling] [bell ringing] - Hey, wait up. 'Scuse me. Excuse me. [laughs] Hey, uh, sorry, I just, I just wanted to tell you you were really great back there. - Oh, the Berber thing. - Yeah. God, that professor's such a jerk, huh? - I was just protecting my people, that's all. - That's really cool. So, you're a history major? - No, I'm studying engineering but I always liked history. - Well look, I'm not sure if you're interested but I'm looking for a study partner to partner up with, and I'm hoping that you'd be interested. - Well, I usually study alone. - Oh, okay. - You know what? Sure, why not? - All right, cool. Well look, I'm gonna be late for class so I gotta go, but, um, here's my number. Go ahead, call me later tonight, and we'll hook up. I mean, [laughs] study. - Okay. - All right, cool. - Study. - Um, what was your name again? - Al. - Al. What's that short for? - Ali. - Ali. All right, cool, Ali. I'm Sara. - Nice to meet you, Sara. - Nice to meet you. I'll see you soon. - See you soon. [phone ringing] [phone vibrating] Hey Lana, how you doing? - I'm good, I'm good. I was just calling to see what you were doing tonight. - Actually, I'm going to be studying with a friend in a little bit. - Hm, party pooper. Well, what about later? - I can't, I got a class in the morning. But Friday night would be good. - Okay, so Friday it is then. - Okay. I'll call you later, all right? - Okay, cool. I'll see you later. - Bye. - I'm tired. I need a coffee. You wanna go to the Grind? - Sure. Do they serve Arabic coffee there? - I don't think so, but, they make great lattes. - What's a latte? - You don't know what a latte is? Come on, I'll show you. [upbeat guitar music] - Enjoy. - Thank you. - See you tomorrow. - Thank you so much. Appreciate it. - It's complicated, huh? - Yeah. Gosh, that's so true. - Here are your two lattes. - Thank you so much. - Anything else? - No, thank you. - We're good, thanks. Gosh, I love the way you look at history. - What do you mean? - I mean, to most people it's just a bunch of names and dates, but you have a way of breathing life into it. - That's because most of Algeria and the Middle East is trapped in history. Everywhere you look in America, you find new, shiny things, buildings, cars, people. Over there you can see history all around you, especially in the people. - Well, I wouldn't say the Middle East is necessarily trapped in history, but it's more like a product of history, you know? I mean, the Middle East is home to some of the world's oldest and greatest civilizations. - Yes, but it will be a long time before the Middle East can stand on its own two feet. - Well maybe the Arab revolution will continue to spread and Algeria will finally get its freedom. - Mm-hm. - What are you thinking about, Ali? - The Arab revolution hasn't changed anything. It's like a mirage in a desert. Eventually the West will replace the rules they put in power 30 years ago, with new puppets. True freedom for Muslim has to come from... - It has to come from what? - [Ali] Freedom has to come from somewhere else. - 2,000 years ago, Rome built cities like this all over the Middle East and held our people by the throat. 80 years ago there wasn't a single US base anywhere in the Middle East. Today they're embedded like ticks everywhere. - I am ready to do whatever Father asks of me. [somber string music] - Engineer. A bullet can kill a man, but nothing can kill an idea. [forceful breathing] - That was great, man. - Thanks. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. It's all about timing. Come on, jump in, you can do it. Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. [groans] - That was pretty close. - Not close enough. - Yeah you're rushing it. You need to take your time. See? Like this. You have to go back and forth. - Okay. All right, I see. It's a great spot, huh? - Reminds me of back home. - Where you from? - Overseas. - I'm Patrick. - Al. I should get going. I'll see you around, all right? - [Patrick] Yeah, yeah, man. - Hey! Ali, Ali, Ali. [speaking in foreign language] Hey, listen, I was hoping you'd come by sometime. My sister just sent me some really good coffee from Damascus. - Damascus? - Yes. - They have the best coffee in the world. - Right. Then you have to try some with me. Come in, let's go drink coffee. So how are you? [lively exotic music] - So when I got the scholarship to come here to get my engineering degree, my father sacrificed a lot to get the money to send me here. And he said I would never get another chance like this again in my life. - Yes, but listen, Ali, your father is a wise man, a good man. A parent will do anything for his children. Anything. - Yeah. - Yes. - Tell me about it. - Yes. - He would never let a chance go by without reminding me. - [laughs] You know, Ali, I came here for similar reasons as you. - Really? - Yeah. - You see, I was about your age when my wife was pregnant with our first child. I wake up in cold sweat one night and realized I'd be a father. I wanted to raise my family someplace where they all have an education, have opportunities I never had. That's why I came to America, for them, not for me. But, I still miss Damascus all the time. Especially with what's going on with the Arab Spring. [laughs] You know, I did a sacrifice for my children that they will never understand. - How many children do you have? - I have two daughters, actually, about your age. The older is just finishing law school and the younger is applying for medical school. [speaks in foreign language] Yes. Can you imagine what their life would be right now in Syria? - Well, I'm glad it worked out for you, Mohammed. I'm planning to go back home once I finish with school, to Algeria. - [laughs] You're a young man, Ali. Anything can happen in a few years. Who knows? You might go back to visit Algeria with your new American wife. [Ali laughs] And a baby. - No, no, I don't think so. - Yes. - My father would kill me. - Really? - Yeah, he would kill me, really. [laughing] - Oh my god. I'll be with you in a minute. Okay. Sorry, I have to-- - I understand. Thanks for the coffee, by the way. It was amazing. [speaking in foreign language] - Ali, listen. Please do not be a stranger. You come by. I wanna make coffee for you a second time, okay? - I will, I promise. - Okay. [speaking in foreign language] [gentle piano music] [patrons screaming] - It's a beautiful night, huh? - Look, I have a confession to make. Even though it's really sweet that you won this for me, I feel a little strange carrying it around. Do you mind if I give it away to someone that might really, really appreciate it? - I won it for you. You have to keep it. My honor is at stake. - Oh, your honor. So you're a marksman sniper clown-balloon assassin. I just want you to know, that 10-year-old back there almost beat you. - Come on, he cheated. I guess it's kind of funny looking. You know what? You can give it away if you want. - [Lana] Here you go. - [gasps] Mommy, look! - Did you say thank you? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. I love little kids. They're so innocent and full of life. - Yeah. Kids are great. My older brother has four little boys. They destroy everything in their way. - You makin' fun of me? - No, I'm serious. [laughing] Kids are great. - Okay. [Lana shivers] Oh. You have a girlfriend? - I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. I'm just not, I'm just not used to this. - Used to what? - Being with a woman in public. [gentle instrumental music] - Oh, you're up. Good morning. - Good morning. - You sleep okay? - Yeah. What's all this? - I thought you might like some coffee. - Thanks. - Um, do you like milk or sugar? - Sugar. I like it sweet. - Well that's good, because my roommate drank all the milk, so. - You have a roommate? - Yeah, sort of, Kelly. She's not really here very often, so I kind of have the place to myself a lot which is awesome, because she's a bitch. How is that? - It's fine. - You're a liar. [laughs] Um, I wanted to say that I had a really good time last night. It's been a long time. I mean, you know, since I've been on a real date. Thanks for being so nice to me. - You're welcome. It's easy being nice to you, Lana. - Oh yeah? - I never met a woman like you before. Passionate, strong, sweet, and so beautiful. What is it? - I just haven't had a man say things like that to me or look at me like that in a really long time. - Like what? - Like you really care about me. - That was nice. - Eat. - Okay, Mom. - [Lana] That's beautiful. What does that mean? - Inner strength, in Arabic. - That's cool. Why'd you get that? - To remind me who I am and where I come from. I guess I'm not, I'm not doing such a good job right now. - Why? - I'm supposed to remain pure in the eyes of God. I'm not supposed to have sex until I get married. It sounds silly, huh? - It's not silly. I'm honored if I could be your first. - So, tell me about your tattoo, I love New York. Did you get it because you're homesick? - No. Maybe. Remember when you asked me at the diner why I left New York, and I said I would tell you sometime? - It's okay. You don't have to tell me if you don't want-- - No, no, no, no. I want to tell you. I haven't told anybody this in a long time. [forceful exhaling] [crying] I left New York 10 years ago because my mother, because my mother worked in the North tower and, um, on September 11th, my whole world crumbled that day, and, I, I lost everything. I had no family and I had no money and I was 15 years old. [sobbing] - It's okay. It's okay, Lana, it's okay. It's okay, don't cry. [melancholy instrumental music] - [Father] Where have you been? You didn't call last week. - I'm sorry, I've been busy studying. - Is everything okay? - Yes. - Good. - Everything's going well. - Stay focused. - I will. - [Father] And don't forget to call next week. - I won't. [upbeat exotic music] [gun firing] - The American and the whole Western world will soon see our true might. And their oppression will cease forever. We will have one Khalifa, one single great leader that will be running all the Middle East without division between us. [children shouting] And be great people like once before. [gun firing] The flag of Islam will be flying from Morocco to Malaysia. But a sacrifice, the martyrdom of few, must bring the salvation to the many. This is my destiny. [gun firing] God has chosen me for this. [wings flapping] [guns firing] [muffled praying in foreign language] [speech drowned out by somber music] - Ali! [train rumbling] [Patrick grunts] [laughs] - Good job, man. - Thanks, Coach. Oh man. I'm gettin' there. - Not bad. - I'll tell you somethin' right now, I'll miss that when I get back to base. - Base? What do you mean? - Semper Fi, baby, a marine base. - Oh. - Guess I didn't tell you, huh? - Oh, no, you didn't. - Yeah. I try to keep this world and that world separate, you know? - So where are you going to? - Afghanistan. Stationed in the south, along the Pakistani border. Does that bother you, Al? - No, just never met an American soldier before. I thought you guys would be, different. - People watch too many movies. Just doin' a job, like everybody else. Well hey, I gotta jet. Hot date for the king of the rings. I'll see you around, huh? - [Reporter] Iranian nuclear development continues at a steady pace while the Iranian president insists his country's uranium enrichment program is for energy and not bombs. The West views Iran's nuclear proliferation as a threat to the region's political-- - Hey Kel. - Hey Lana, what's up? Do you have the rent yet? - It's been kinda slow. - What the fuck does that mean? - What do you mean, what the fuck does that mean? It means that it's been kinda slow. That's what the fuck it means. Don't be a bitch. - You know what? Calm the fuck down. Are you on that shit again? Have you been seeing Leroy? - No, I'm clean. I haven't seen Leroy in months. I'm clean. - Then what? - What nothing, it's just been kinda slow. - Yeah. Okay. Look, I'm gonna head to the White Tail tonight. Some cash rolled in. You need to join me, really. - What time? - Cab at 11:00. I'm gonna take a disco nap so I'll see you in a few hours. [lawn mower humming] [bell ringing] - Hey Ali. - Hey. Hey Sara, how you doin'? - Good. Why weren't you in class yesterday? - I overslept. - Well, you're in luck, 'cause I made you a copy of my notes. - Cool. - So you don't fall behind. - Thanks, you're so sweet. - [giggles] I wouldn't want my study partner slipping up now. Midterms are next week. Speaking of which, are we meeting up tonight to study? - Yeah, sure. Nine o'clock at the library? - Sounds perfect. - I'll see you then, all right? - All right, cool. - Be safe. - See ya later. - Bye. - Bye. [bell chiming] [soft instrumental music] - [Man] Let Jesus into your life. Purify the sins of your soul. [speaks in foreign language] - Brother. [speaks in foreign language] I saw you yesterday outside the mosque. I was hoping you'd come in. - I didn't have time. - One has to make time for Allah. You know, Ali, it is perfectly natural for a young man to struggle with his faith. There's nothing wrong with that. I struggled myself when I was younger. You'll find the right path. - I never said I was searching. - Ah, you don't have to. It's written all over your face. - Why do you come here every day? - To speak to Allah. To remind myself how great he is, how small I am. You know, once you can see yourself from a true perspective, it's easier to be honest with those around you. - I am honest. - A man with a weight on his shoulders, especially a man with the gravity of the weight you carry on yours, cannot possibly be honest with himself. And if he is not honest with himself, he can't be honest with those around him. Here. Look. This is you, at the center of the world, of the universe. Unless you're completely honest with you, you can't be honest with your first circle, your parents. Then, your second circle, your siblings, your relatives. Then your third circle, a good woman, mother of your children, your wife. Then your fourth circle, your friends, and your fifth circle, your community, your mosque, and so on and so on. See, if your center is not completely solid, the rest collapses. You understand? - Yes, I do. So, how can I find the center? - You don't. Allah finds it for you. All you have to do is let him in. He'll do the rest. You think life is tough now? Wait till you get married. [gentle string and piano music] - Hey. [Lana gasps] You ready? Not tonight. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. [sniffing] [dramatic techno music] [laughing] - You know, he's one of my favorite. - She'll take good care of you. - She always does. - The usual? - Yes. - Yeah. - [mumbles] These are the two girls I was telling you about. - Good evening, ladies. - Hi, honey. - I haven't seen you two here before. - We come and go. You must have missed us. - Well, I'm glad I didn't miss you tonight. - You like that? - Yeah, I do. So, are you gals three-hole courses? - Mister, wherever you can stick that dick of yours, we can take it. - Sounds like we have a deal. - [Kelly] We come as a pair, two grand a piece. - [Business Man] Wouldn't have it any other way. - [Kelly] Perfect. [sobering instrumental music] - [Business Man] Undress each other. - Lana, don't fuck this up for us. - Now, get down on your knees and crawl over here. - [Kelly] Who is it? - Hey, Lana, it's me, Al. [banging] - She's not home. - Oh, you're her roommate. - Yeah. - Look, I'm sorry to bother you, but I haven't heard from her in a week. Her phone goes straight to voicemail. I just want to make sure she's okay. - She's fine. How do you know where she lives? - Excuse me? - Who are you? - I'm her friend, Al. - Look, she's got lots of friends, Al, okay? She's out of town for a few days. Don't worry about her. - Look, I just want to make sure she's all right, okay? - She's okay, all right? - Just tell her Al came by. - Sure, I'll tell her you came by, Al. - Thank... [door slams] [melancholy instrumental music] - Hey, he's gone. I sent him away. - Thanks. [crying] [speaking in foreign language] - I need to talk to you about something I did. And you're the only one I can talk to. My father wouldn't understand. I slept with a woman. - Allah designed us to be attracted to women. That's natural. But the attraction to women can be very powerful, especially at your age. If you have feelings for this woman, you respect her, you wanna build a relationship with her that is fitting between a man and a woman, then you should think about marriage. But just to be with her for physical pleasure, that's not good for either of you. That's not Allah's way. - I know, I know. I'll try to be good. - [laughs] There is none good but Allah. You know, men your age should be thinking about marriage. Startin' a family. Otherwise you'll be an old man raising a teenager, and trust me, you won't have the energy for it. - Thank you for listening, Sheik. - Not at all. Will you join us at the mosque for Friday prayers? - Yes, I will. Promise. [speaking in foreign language] [soft string music] I missed you so much. - I'm sorry, I was away. - It's okay. I'm just glad to be here with you. What's wrong? - When I'm with you, I, I feel amazing. - I love you. - Don't say that. - But I do love you. I think about you all the time. - Don't. There's something I have to tell you. - What is it? - I haven't, I haven't lied to you but I haven't been totally honest with you either. In the beginning it didn't really matter because you were just some guy I met, and now everything's kinda changed, and, I'm starting to have real feelings for you. Look, I know you're a little younger than I am and I'm the first woman you've ever been with, so I think I know what you're feeling. And it's not love. - But I do love you. I can feel it, I do-- - Just listen to me. I just need to finish this. It's really important. That first night I met you, and you saved me, I already had a really strong feeling for you. And you're already such a good man and I can see that when you look at me and I can feel that when you touch me. And, you're probably like one of the first guys who's ever really given a damn about me, but, like, I could be falling in love with you. - So why are you crying? - Because I'm going to tell you something that's probably gonna make you leave. - I won't leave you. Whatever it is, I won't leave you. [somber piano music] - Okay. Up until a few days ago, I was an escort. - What do you mean? - I mean, I survived by having sex with men for money. Do you understand? - What did you, what did you say to me? - I said... Look, I'm not ashamed of who I was because it's all behind me now and it's in the past and it's over. You don't understand. When my mother died, I was raised in foster home to foster home, and I was raped so many times that I just... Look at me! [sobbing] I will be a good woman for you. I've changed, Al. I love you. - How could you know what love is, huh? You're a fucking whore! - Don't leave me. Don't go! [sobbing] [dramatic instrumental music] Oh god, god! [exotic string music] - It's a nuclear warhead. - From the cradle of civilization comes the destroyer of civilization. I need your help, engineer, to make sure it's detonated properly. - [Ali] Where is it? - It's being kept hidden on the other side of the world. It will be delivered when we're ready. - Ready for what? - Ready to free millions of Muslims from slavery. - [Sara] There you are. - Hey. - How have you been? - Just exhausted. - Oh, totally. - I mean, how do you say? Cram for midterms. - Yeah, no, me too. So, did you get your results back yet? - Yep. - And? - Straight A's. - No way! Oh my god, that's amazing, Ali. I mean, you get all A's on exams in another language. I could hardly pull off all B's. Guess it's the blonde in me. - I just got lucky, I guess. - No, you didn't just get lucky. You're really smart, Ali. Hey, I'm having a little after-exam dinner party at my house tonight. You wanna come? - Yeah, sure. - Cool, eight o'clock. - Okay. - I'll text you my address. - Okay, see you then. - I will see you then. [knocking] Come in. ♪ Taking the time to find out ♪ If it's all just a game - Hey, Ali! [squeals] - You look so beautiful. - Thank you, you look very handsome. So, dinner's almost ready. Did you want a glass of wine? - No, thanks, I don't drink. - Well, guess I'll have to drink for us both. - I thought you were having a dinner party. - I am. It's a party for two. I hope you like mushrooms. - I love mushrooms. Smells good. - Thank you, Ali. I, um, I wanted to make you something special. [upbeat rock music] ♪ Through the skies ♪ Through the skies ♪ Well it's just like you to run away ♪ - What is it, Ali? What's wrong? - You're Jewish. - You didn't know I was Jewish? - No. - Well, what's wrong with that? Ali? - I'm sorry. I can't do this. - Ali? [muffled sirens wailing] - Wow. You're good. - Old man was a pool shark, so it's in my blood, you know? - All right. - Come on, baby. Shit! Playing with scrap. [mumbles] playing games. You all good? You seem stressed out. You okay? [balls thudding] - Just adjusting to LA, I guess. - Adjusting to LA, okay. Sounds like lady troubles to me. What's her name? - It's more like two names. - Okay. [laughing] Al, I didn't think you had it in you, but you know what? I'm impressed. - It's not like that. There were two and now... - And now what? Hell, you know what? Let me tell you something right now. I'm not one to be dispensing advice on women. The longest relationship I ever had was six months with a CO named Shirley Johnson on my first tour in Iraq. Good god, she was good. But she was batshit crazy, I'll tell ya that right now. [laughs] She pulled a gun on me 'cause she thought I was cheatin' on her. I mean, can you imagine that? I go to war, I come back, my goddamn girlfriend almost blows my head off. Now that'd be a modern-day tragedy. - Tragedy. 100,000 Iraqi children died from your war. Now that's tragedy. - Come on, Al, don't tell me about that. That's a bunch of bullshit. You know that just as well as I do. - You're out there attacking innocent people. But I guess Arab blood doesn't count, does it? - We're out there saving innocent people. Iraq now has a constitution, and America did that. Saddam Hussein was a fuckin' lunatic that tortured and killed his own people for 30 years. Everybody knows that. That's fact. - Torture? Did you fuckin' forget Abugraid? America made a fuckin' career out of torturing Muslim. - A bunch of fuckin' terrorists hijack planes and crash 'em into our buildings, you goddamn right we're gonna do whatever it takes to stop that from happening again. - You do realize that none of the 19 hijackers were Iraqi citizens, right? - Iraq was the linchpin to terrorist sympathizers all across the region. You cannot stand there in good conscience and tell me that what we did had nothin' to do with the Arab Spring. Tell me that. We had every right to invade Iraq, Al. - You should hear yourself. What gives America the right, huh? [stick clattering] And why are you always in someone else's country? - Hey Pat, everything all right here? - Yeah, Mike, everything's okay. We're just talkin'. - Sounds like trash talkin' to me. You should teach your friend here some manners. - Mike. We're just talkin', Mike. - Talkin's over. - Al, you should go. Just go. - I thought this was a free country. - What was that? - Mike. Al, just go. It's not worth it, Al, just go. Go. Please. - I was just leaving. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Father? It's me. - What's wrong? Your voice doesn't sound right. - I'm fine, we're just having a bad connection. - [Father] How were your exams? - Good, straight As. - [Father] You don't sound right. You don't sound focused. I'm focused, I'm just a little tired, that's all. - [Father] Ali. - Father, hello? - I'm here, Ali. - Hello? - [Father] I wanted to go see your brother in Europe. He has important news for you about your sister. - What, what is it? Is everything okay? - [Father] He'll tell you in person. Call me when you get to New York. - Father, hello? - [Operator] If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. - Hello? Hello? [phone banging] [exotic string music] - And remember, stay away from mosques and don't get involved with women. - I won't. I will make you proud, Brother, I promise. - The whole Muslim world will be proud of you. [bell chiming] - Hey Sara. Can I sit? - Sure, it's a free country. - I don't know what to say, really. - It's okay, Ali, I understand. - I don't have anything against the Jewish people. I have a problem with the Israeli state, what they have done to the Palestinians. You and I, we're practically cousins. [laughs] - What do you mean? - Our father is Abraham, right? - Right. [laughs] - I'm really sorry about the other night. - Thank you. So, cuz, you wanna take a ride up the coast with me? - Mm-hm. - Cool, let's do it. - Let's go. - Come on. [lively piano and string music] [moving to ominous music] [car honking] [indistinct chatter] - [speaks in foreign language] Brother. - Engineer. You're late. - I was being cautious. - Father is not happy. - He said it had to do with sister. - It does. He wants you to go see her. - Already? It's too soon. I thought he wanted it-- - Don't think, Engineer. Do. Father moved up the time. - When? - I don't know. Doesn't matter. - Have you prepared everything here? - Yeah, I'm ready. The question is, are you ready? - Never doubt me, Brother. I spent my entire life leading to our victory over this. - You will seek out Sister. You'll find her in the black pyramid. She's waiting for you. - Okay. - Prepare yourself. [ominous music] - Who is it? - It's me, Al. - Come inside and close the door. Turn on the lights. Make a move and you die. - What is this? Father sent me. - Shut your mouth. Move over to the bed, now. [suspenseful music] Take your shirt off. Do it. [gun clicks] I won't ask again. Turn to the side. [speaking in foreign language] Engineer. - [speaks in foreign language] Sister. What was that all about? - The Mossad are always one step behind us. They intercepted a cell and replaced him with one of their own in Buenos Aires. - What happened? - One less Mossad. You will return to Los Angeles and wait for Brother and I to join you. - Los Angeles? What about New York? It's the better target. - It's also the more difficult target. Security is too high. Los Angeles is weaker. The device is already there. You will contact our transporter tomorrow. Is there a problem? - No. It's just that the device is more effective in a tighter area like New York. Los Angeles is so spread out. - It will be effective enough. Millions will die. [banging] The warhead has a 300 kilo ton capacity. Hiroshima was only 15 kilo tons. [truck beeping] [suspenseful music] [speaking in foreign language] - Father sent word that you'd be coming. Is it time? - Soon. - You know what to do? - Yes. The cargo is ready. When and where do you want it delivered? - I'll call you the day before the wedding, with the exact time and place. [phone beeping] [phone ringing] - [Father] Ali, meet us at the rooftop of the Palace Hotel tomorrow at sunset. - Okay. [suspenseful music] [somber exotic music] - Now that you are all here, let the clock begin. In a few days, all this will be gone. - Hey Al. I haven't seen you around in a while. - I just got back from New York a few days ago. - You have fun? - Not really. Family stuff. But it's all good now. - Yeah. - So you're gonna leave us, then? - You know, my parents were immigrants, Al. Came to this country to start a new life, live the American dream. My service to my country is my way of keeping that dream alive. Al, I know a soldier when I see one. I knew the first day we met you were training to do what I do. - And what's that? - To kill. The question is, which side are you on? - Soldiers always fight on the same side, brother. Right versus wrong. [somber music] - Hey, I love this country, Al. And so do you. You just don't know it yet. [speaks in foreign language] Brother. [speaks in foreign language] - Okay, you remember how I told you how I always wanted to study abroad? Well, I just found out I got accepted to the American University of Rome. [laughs] - That's great, Sara. - Eh. - I'm happy for you. - Yeah, but I'm not sure I'm gonna go. - Why not? - 'Cause you know how I feel about you, Ali. I mean, if staying here would bring us closer, then I'd stay. - No, no, no. Don't stay here for me. You should go. - Okay. Then I'll go. [speaking in foreign language] - What do you want from me, huh? I told you, I didn't do anything wrong! - You have information we need. - What do you want from me? I don't have any information. I didn't do anything wrong. - Sir-- - I love this country. - Do not resist, sir. - Please cooperate. - Make sure you read him his rights. - Do not resist, sir! Put your hands behind your back. - But I'm innocent! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be held against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. - I'm a good citizen, a good man. - If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. [suspenseful music] [engine igniting] [police radio chattering indistinctly] [siren wailing] - Brother, it's me. Tell Father we need to move up the wedding day. - When? - Tomorrow. - Understood. [phone beeps] [sizzling] [beeping] [somber instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] - Is Suleyman here? - No, he's not, brother. Is your name Ali? - Yes. I've been looking for him for days. Where is he? - I'm sorry to tell you, but he's actually at the hospital about a week now. He's been quite ill. - What hospital? - It's down the street. It's called the Vermont Cancer Hospital. - I have to go see him. - Okay. [speaking in foreign language] [phone ringing] - [Man] Vermont Cancer Clinic, please hold. - [Automated Voice] Third Floor. - He's ready to see you now. - Thank you. [gentle string music] [beeping] [speaking in foreign language] - I knew you'd come. - Why didn't you tell me you were sick? - We always have such nice conversations about life. I didn't wanna speak of death. I had a dream last night. You were in the mosque. You began the call to prayer. - Can I get you something? Some water? - Yes, please. [labored breathing] - Sheik, please continue the dream. - Ah, the dream. - Yes. - You began the call to prayer. It was so beautiful. Angels came down from heaven. In the night sky, you could see it written in the stars, God is great. - I feel something important is coming. And it scares me. - Nothing ever happens to us except what Allah has ordained for us. - Can I call the doctor? - No. No, pray for me. [praying in foreign language] [ominous music] [interposing voices gibbering] - What are you doing here? - Can I come in for a minute? - Come on up. [kettle whistling] You want something? - No. - You're freaking me out. What's going on? - Lana, I need to say something to you before I go. - Where are you going? - I can't tell you, but please listen to me. I do love you in my own way, but we can never be together. You gotta find somebody who can love you for who you are, not what you were. - Where is this all coming from? What do you want from me? - Lana, I want you to leave LA. - What? - Just for a few days. Here, take it. Buy a plane ticket, bus ticket. Just leave, all right? - Why, what the fuck is going on? - Promise me you'll leave tonight. Promise me! - I'll promise, fine, I'll go. - I love you. - Wait. I'm pregnant. - Don't tell me that just to stop me from going. - I'm not. Look, I found out this morning and I wasn't going to tell you. But you know, I didn't think you loved me then and now I'm thinking we could be together-- - There's no we. There's no us. Please, just, just go, all right? Just go. [door slams] - [Reporter] The president returned from the Middle East Peace Summit today and said the United States will consider to pursue its interest in the region, mainly preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, counter terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Isis, and encouraging Arab Israeli peace talks. He warned that no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in such a volatile region, especially after the Arab Springs collateral chaos in countries like Libya, Egypt, and especially Syria, whose civil war has spilled into it's neighboring countries of Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, and Iraq, fueling the rise of dangerous terrorist groups like Isis who are responsible for kidnappings, beheadings, and bombings. [ominous music] [interposing voices gibbering] [truck beeping] [gun clicking] [engine humming] [praying in foreign language] - These are for you. - Father. This wasn't part of the plan. - If anything goes wrong and we cannot get to the device. We will kill as many of our enemies as possible. Hm? - We are all wearing one. [praying in foreign language] [ominous music] - 10 minutes. - It's time to engage the vests. [interposing voices gibbering] [praying in foreign language] [sirens wailing] [phone ringing] - [Man] Father, the package is ready. - Excellent. [phone beeps] [gun clicks] - [Man] Two blocks away from target. [laughing] - Baby, a baby, yeah? - You have a way of breathing life into it. - [speaks in foreign language] Brother. - There is none good but Allah. - [Lana] I'm pregnant. [praying in foreign language] - No! [speaks in foreign language] - No! - Traitor! [explosion booms] - [Reporter] A van exploded in Los Angeles today, killing four people believed to be members of a terrorist cell.
