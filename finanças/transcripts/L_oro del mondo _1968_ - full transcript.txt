FRANCO & CICCIO COLD CUTS-BREAD-PASTA At least explain to me why you left your job so unexpectedly. You offended my dignity as a butler. -And my respectability as chauffeur. -In what way? By always having your accountant order supplies. By always having me pass by your accountant, for car parts, oil for the engine and coupons for gas. -It means lack of trust. -It is like doubting our honesty. Remove the blue-cheese. It stinks! In a respected embassy, the butler must buy groceries. Even in one that isn't respected, the chauffeur must buy gas. With cash. Otherwise, how can we scrounge extra money to add to our salary? We had the chance of buying this grocery store, and we did it. So we can steal on prices, on weight, on everything! Esteemed mister diplomat, we have a pupil to support with his studies. The pupil manages. -Manages! -One doesn't live on bread alone. Our pupil at the university needs money for movies, cigarettes and small vices. -I won't support his small vices. -Then support the big ones. Neither big of small. Take it or leave it. We left a while ago. It's true, I had forgotten. I'm sorry. -So are we. -It's life. Anyway, whenever you want to come back, my embassy is always open for you. -Very kind of you. -Goodbye. Honorable, your fur. -Fur? -The sausage fur! Oh, excuse me! -My hat. -Excuse me. If you would honor us by buying in our store… -We'll give you higher prices. -Yes. I will send my accountant. Goodbye. My hand is dirty. -He is a good diplomat. -Yes, too good! If he isn't kicked out of the embassy, he'll get his country into trouble. What a lovely surprise! Our friendly cessionary! -Thank you. -What good wind brings you here? You bought my store. Exactly. -With a payment in 15 days. -Exactly. I was certain that I was dealing with gentlemen. -That's not exact. -Why? Only you are a gentleman. So kind of you! Also modest. -Please, cut short. -What? -Come to the point. -What? To the heart. To the core. On the promissory notes it says, "We'll pay in 15 days". -As agreed upon. -Yes, but there's a mistake. A mistake? I don't notice anything. Do you? -Looks fine to me. -Come on, gentlemen! We are not gentlemen. The date is February 28, 1978. -What year were we to put? -The current one. Who will give us 10 million on March 15th? Then it wasn't a mistake. You swindled me. Watch out how you speak. Nobody ever called us "swindlers". If anything, "thieves"! You should have checked the promissory notes. I couldn't. You filled my head with words. You pulled me to one side, then the other, up and down… And you even broke my glasses! You broke our eardrums. Speak softly! Yes. What can I do? I need money to live on. I only had this store. I'll have to beg now on a street corner. Come on! We won't let you starve to death. You can come every day to buy groceries, we'll put it on the bill. -Happy? -Thank you. -Will you give me money too? -Yes. If by February 28, 1978 you haven't spent everything here, we'll give you the rest in cash. In 1978? Mister cessionary, don't exaggerate. Go on… You can never be generous. You give them a finger and they want the whole hand. Carlo's professor. Professor! What a coincidence! What are you doing in this area? This is our area now. We bought this grocery store in cash. Good! Then it's a double coincidence because I just bought this store. Filippo Pugliesi & Mo. Guess. -Modena. -No. -Monarch. -Not that either. -Modern. -No. -Mother. -What's that have to do with it? "Filippo Pugliesi & Mother." You're not close. "Filippo Pugliesi & Moglie." My wife. -You got married? -Yes. With the History of Art teacher? -Exactly. -My compliments! Thank you. Why did you leave your teaching job to sell electric appliances? Since my wife now has a university teaching job, I didn't want to feel inferior to my wife, so I took a sabbatical waiting period. -What are you waiting for? -My retirement, in two years. Please, come in. I want to show you if I had taste or not. Come. -What do you think? -Magnificent! -Beautiful! -We have everything. From a pocket light to an American kitchen. That back door leads to the apartment. -We're all set. -A set of plates. Plates for 12 people, porcelain! Our back door leads to our home too, but we don't have a porcelain set of dishes. -What doesn't he understand? -Anything. What about that door? I had never noticed it. I only took possession of it this morning. It must be a closet room, a wardrobe. What a closet room! It's a supply room. Look at all this wonderful stuff. Ham, salami, mortadella… -Professor… -It's a treasure! -Excuse us. -This is our grocery store. It's true. It was too good to be true. -I'm sorry. -What a coincidence! -Then we are adjacent. -"Advacent"? You are over there, and I am over here. Amphibians. No, tele-communicating. Carosello! -Would you like to enter? -Yes, with pleasure. What do you think? My compliments! Compliments to you too. What an assortment! And what abundance! There is a bit of everything. From lentils to a mountain of ham. Mountain ham! Don't be so precise. How is your pupil, Carlo Carrera? Very well! He's in his first year of "Sisichs". Physics! He wants to be a nuclear physicist. He's a born physicist. -He'll get married in two years. -With Lorena Vivaldi? -Who else? -Yes. The young crush grew and became love. Eternal and indissoluble love. Good. I'm very happy. Excuse me, I must go call my wife at the university. What'll we do about the door? -We must close it. -I wouldn't bolt it. So during leisure time, when we've nothing to do, we'll open the door and chat. I trust you. Do you trust me? Of course! You don't even have to say it. Thank you. Good work and see you later. -Do you trust the professor? -Sure. I wouldn't want him to come here at night and get supplies. No, he wouldn't be capable of something like that. -You think he's someone like you? -It's true. I'll steal a television set one night. You'd betray a friend for a vulgar television set? You're right, Ciccio, I'll steal the American kitchen! I know that the university city is big. Do you think I'm illiterate? I'm a professor too! Look for her. Professor, your wife is already home. She's not here. She must come by the shop first. The apartment is upstairs. Your wife is at the store. That idiot insists! I said that she's not here. And don't you dare use that tone. -Should I be more formal? -Of course. And when my wife comes, I'll tell her. Kitten, was it you talking? I thought it was her! Honey… Tell me how it went. -What? -The first day of school. The teacher is very pleasant and my classmates are nice. But I want a sweet in my basket tomorrow. -What is it? Do you feel sick? -You are sick. You think I'm a little school girl? I've waited years for this university teaching position. Excuse me, dear. I am very happy for you. Unicuique suum, non praevalebant. -Bunt, bunt! It's true, it's future. "They won't prevail." -Who? -The enemies. We all have them. Did your enemies come to do this exhibition? Why? Is something the matter? Everything. I'll tell you this as a History of Art professor. -Move them. -What? For example, those mixers must be more in sight. That's all? For so little… -Where should I put them? -On that washing machine. -Are you happy? -No. -The washing machine can crush them. -But the washing machine is below! -It crushes upward. -I'll move them. -Move the washing machine. -Where? -In place of the mixers. -What about them? -Leave them there. -You've begun commanding… -It's not a joke. -It'll be fine there. This stuff is heavy. Is this okay? Look at those heaped up television sets. Move one and put it where the radio is. Alright, if you say it doesn't look good up here… -I'll put it here. -Very good, kittycat. -Thank you. -Put the radio there. To please you, I'll put two radios on the counter. See how awful that huge television looks? Kittycat… move it. -Where should I put it? -Move it. -Where? -The entrance. It'll look good. -You are crazy! At the entrance… -Go on, kittycat! It'll look fine. Go straight. These television sets, to the right. This one, to the left. The cabinet, to the right. The washing machine, like that. The television set, to the right. No! No! Take it back. Fine. Put these three television sets there. This one, on the left. The washing machine, in front there. The television set, to the left. The washing machine, farther up. The cabinet, to the right. The cabinet, to the left. On the shelf. Under the bench… Kittycat will die! How tiring! Sure. It's tiresome to command. I put gas and don't have money. But watch out, it makes you live less. Yes, but it lets you smoke! Thanks. Something for the students? Will you give something? I've no coins. Will you be here when I return? No. You can send a postal order. "First year students of Rome." It's wasted energy. The bus isn't mine! A homage to the School of Physics. -How's it going? - Fine, and you? -Almost 2,000 Liras. -We'll have fun tonight. -Get started. -Lorena, do you care for me? -I love you. But don't tell anyone. -I swear. Everyone knows. The traffic light is green. Will you let me by? Alright, go. -Lorena! -Hi, Giorgio. Are you practicing to become Carlo's wife? -What do you mean? -He wanted a tip when he was a waiter. Carlo worked honestly to pay for his studies. He will become a great physicist. He may become a great physicist, but… One is born a beggar. Take it to him. You're a beggar even if you have billions, when you keep on begging for the love of one who despises you. And I despise you, Giorgio. Carlo sends this to you. Buy a bit of humanity with it. -14,100 Lira. -I collected 1,000 Lira. -I collected this. -Did you see Rockefeller? I had some coins and I changed them. With this bill we've reached 24,100 Lira. -Is there anyone else? -Me. I only collected 50 Lira. Sure, with that face… Next time bring your sister, she's prettier. We have 25,100 Lira. It's enough to paint the town red! Oh no! At the most we can have a plate of spaghetti. No. I know a fun and cheap place outside of Rome. That way, we'll take a ride too. -What place is it? -A fashionable one. Could we wear evening clothes? Black tie is mandatory. Magnificent! Tonight we'll all go to… What is it called? -Big Hut. -The name doesn't sound great. The uglier the name, the more chic the place is. True! All the aristocracy goes to "Heel and Toe". Alright then, tonight at nine, all in evening attire at the Big Hut! Come, son. I had promised that, as soon as you began university, I'd have made you vice-president of my company. Alright. That day has come. -Thanks, Dad. -Please, Mr. Vice-President. It's magnificent. An important office for a man who'll become important. But behind tables like these, life becomes difficult. -I like difficult things. -Bravo. Nothing is impossible when there's will power. I'm leaving in an hour for Hamburg and will be away a week. My absence will be your trial period. So I authorize you to represent me in absolutely everything. -Thanks for your trust in me, Dad. -I know you will make it. But in case of difficulty, turn to accountant Ferretti, who was my right hand. I know, but I hope I will not need him. I am sure of it. I must go now, or I'll miss the flight. One more thing… On your desk there is a keyboard full of buttons. It is a dangerous toy. Always think twice before pressing one. -It is my rule. -It will be mine too. Good. -Do a good job, son. -Have a good trip, Dad. -Make good deals. -Thanks. Come in. Good morning. -What is it, sir? -Don't call me that. I'm in my first year of university. You will soon be one. It Italy, you need only own a car to be called "sir". Besides the car, you also have a vice-presidency. Sit down, please. -Something to drink? -I'm allergic to alcohol. Do you know the Vivaldi company? Yes, it produces furniture and metal shelves. -I know. -We are on good terms. Your father gave them a loan to renew their machinery. -200 million. -With what guarantee? Blank promissory notes and 25 percent of the shares. So the Vivaldi company is in bad waters? Not in excellent ones, but it will get back on its feet soon. In the industrial world, a crisis is normal. Even other companies… -We were talking about Vivaldi. -Right. Your father has great esteem for Mr. Vivaldi. I am sure that he will carry out the commitment he made. -We can't do it. -But… Tomorrow morning cash in all the promissory notes. And sell off the shares. You can't! We can. In fact, we must. Excuse my frankness, but it is a disloyal action. It would mean destroying a man and an industry. The company is not in bankruptcy, the shares are doing well. I suggest that you wait for your father to return. Thank you for your unnecessary advice, but do what I said. I've no other orders to give you. You can go. -Here's Carlo. -Where did you take us? It's a place that's being launched. -You even had us dress up! -To be like me. You were obliged to wear a black tie. Yes, I was obliged because I sing here. They give me 8,000 Lira a night. I didn't earn that as a waiter. Kids, eat and drink. I'll pay up to 8,000 Lira. Go! Give them what they want. Up to 8,000, not more! Catari'… Catari'… Why do you tell me such bitter words? Why do you talk to me and torment my heart, Catarì? Do not forget that I gave you my heart, Catarì. Do not forget. What meaning do your words hold? Words that leave me shuddering?. You… You do not think of my pain. You do not think of it, you do not care. Heart, ungrateful heart, you took my life. Everything has passed and you don't think about me anymore. Heart, ungrateful heart. You took my life. Everything has passed and you don't think about me anymore. Not anymore. We are a lovely couple. There aren't mirrors to see ourselves in, here. How long have you been singing here? A week. Do you mind? Not at all. In fact, you'll work and earn money. But we can't be together anymore in the evening. No. Big Hut is only opened Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. We have four free evenings a week. "Uoy evol I". -What did you say? -"I love you" backwards. We don't say "I love you" anymore. It's ridiculous. I like being ridiculous like this. I love you, Carlo. "Uoy evol I". Uoy evol I, Lorena. Stop! Kids, let's liven the place up. Do you know a square dance? One, two, three… Gentlemen, leave that dance, choose a partner and get on the dance floor. At a four feet distance, men and women, vis-à-vis. Women form a cross and turn in the center. Then take your partner's hand, go back to the center and turn again. The men will play a strange game and women will jump. Break the circle and return with two rows. Now form a very long line. Jump here, jump there. Lean to the side. Men on the left, women on the right. Here's peeled tomatoes. Something else? -Two slices of ham. -Right away. I want it lovely, pink, and without nerves. Don't worry. Our pigs are raised with Cynar. A peaceful life without getting angry. One kilo 400 grams. What? Two slices of ham? -Look at the scale. -It can't be. Then weigh this with a scale you trust. These are two steaks. They seem big to me too. Excuse me but I haven't practiced much with the slicer. -I'll try again. -And I should wait here? I'll go to another store, where people know what they're doing. It's crazy. The customer is always right. What would you like? I live nearby. I'd like to pay at the end of the month. Do you give credit? In this case, the client is always wrong. We only give credit to 80-year-old people accompanied by their parents. -What would you like, madam? -Two oil bread buns. -Two milk bread buns. -Yes. Two baguettes. -And a kilo of Cannolicchi pasta. -Right away. Here. A kilo of Maccheroni pasta. -I said "Cannolicchi". -Aren't Maccheroni alright? I can't use Maccheroni with lentils. -They are good with ragu sauce. -Lentils? -Maccheroni. -My husband wants pasta and lentils. And he will eat it. I'll get the Cannolicchi pasta. -300 grams of gorgonzola? -Yes, with worms. My husband doesn't eat it without worms. -I'll get it in the back room. -Why is it there? I keep it here, but the worms take it there. How funny! Did you see the gorgonzola go by? Then I'll look for it. Gorgonzola! Where can it have gone? Gorgonzola, come out! -Here. -Let me see. These Cannolicchi are all crooked and badly cut. It's a modern cut, Picasso style. I had to fight to get it. It was running here and there. I'll wrap it up now. See what a sprint? They are first quality worms. Stop! They are worms in a Ferrari. -Good morning, Miss Lorena. -What a pleasure! -Is Carlo here? -He's upstairs studying. -You want to go up? -Yes, I'll go say hello to him. Ciccio, do you think she'll give him a kiss? -She will. -Here I am! -Franco, stop it! -Are my hands like Franco's? Sorry. I didn't imagine you'd come to see me. I came to see your den. Nice! -Why that suitcase? -I'm going to my mother's. -I haven't seen her in a year. -When are you leaving? Today. I'd have called you to tell you and see you. -Will you be gone a long time? -Two or three days. You leave me to go to another woman! Yes, but I met her a long time before you. -Are you leaving right away? -No, in three hours. -We've three hours to ourselves. Come. -Let's go! Keep calling Ferretti until he answers. And call me right back to give me news. We're not waiting for Dad? He said to start without him. How strange! It's the first time that we don't eat together. There is always a first time for everything. What is going on? Nothing, dear. It's not true, you seem very worried. I am not a child anymore. It's because of Dad, huh? Dad is going through a difficult time because of the factory. A bad blow that he wasn't expecting. He hopes to solve the situation today or tomorrow. If that isn't the case, our situation could completely change. I would be especially sorry for you, my little one. Just as you are about to become a woman. I am already a woman! And if it is chance… If Ferretti can't do anything, I'll go bankrupt. Where will I find 200 million the day after tomorrow? The production has stopped. I can find 10 or 20 million, but not 200! It's a deplorable action, a stab in the back! Call all the hotels in Hamburg and find him at all costs, and call me at any hour. Then we have never been rich! We were, and we'd still be, if your father hadn't been so worried about his good name, his thousand workers and the factory. It was enough to sell it a year ago. -Sit down, they'll serve you. -I'm not hungry, thank you. I am going to bed because I need to sleep. Good night, dear. We must be close to Dad, whatever happens. -And give up many things. -Everything, Mom! My son! Carlo, my son! -How are you? -Very well. And you? Don't you see me? If you were close to me, I'd feel better. -Me too, Mom. What can I do? -I know. You must work and study. -And I must eat too. I'm hungry. -Come inside. If I'd known of your arrival, I'd have killed a hen. -Nothing has changed. -Nothing! As when you were a child. Sit down. Eat this for now. -I'll make Tagliatelle pasta. -Thanks, Mom. -May I tell you the truth? -Tell me. -Your introduction dismayed me. -A nice compliment! The vast program dismayed me. We're off to a good start! You must only think of studying. -But I must work too. -Why? Dad's business is going badly and I think I understood that someone wants to eliminate his industry. I'm sorry. I'd like to at least provide for my studies. -What would you like to do? -Anything. My husband treats customers like students in high school. I mix up a washing machine with a fan. Would you help my husband at the store? I'd like to, if your husband agrees. What's he have to do with it? The store is his but I am the boss! -You can come today. -Thank you. -Are you waiting for Carlo? -He went to see his mother. That's why he's not here with you. I'll give you a ride. I am proud of you, my son. Alone, without anyone's help, working and studying, you enrolled in the university. Some people helped me, Franco and Ciccio. Two men as poor as I am. Without them, I'd have gone back to ask the count for a shovel and hoe. He would have given you more because of the memory of your dad. Your father was an honest man. I work because I want to. The count would give me everything I need. But I am attached to my land as I am to you. -I suffer in being away from you. -Me too, Mom. Then stay here with me. The count is looking for an administer. He said that, if you want, you could continue your studies and work for him right away. Thank the count, but I can't accept. I can't give up my aspirations. Maybe you are right, Carlo. -Good evening, Miss Lorena. -Is Carlo back? -No, he'll be back tomorrow. -He stayed a few extra days. It would've been better if you'd called us. I had to come. I work here with the professor. -You work? -Everyone must now. -You are too democratic! -It will be a surprise for Carlo. It was a surprise for me too. See you tomorrow. -Something smells funny. -Impossible! The gorgonzola must have reached the back room. No, I am not convinced with Lorena's work. It's true. Work is an excuse. She comes to study with the professors because she wants to become better than Carlo. No. Carlo could swallow Lorena and the professors. Well said! -What are you doing? -I swallowed them. Don't be an idiot! Close up. Show me if the hole is big. I did everything, but without Mr. Castelli's intervention, the bank can't do anything. -And we can't find him. -It seems he is in Berlin. -I don't believe it. We're friends. Years of collaboration unite us. He encouraged me to renew the machinery. And then suddenly he blackmails? It's not possible. I don't think that Castelli knows about this matter. -Was it the administrator? -No. Mr. Ferretti assured me of having protested. The initiative came from Castelli's son. A 20-year-old whose father entrusted the factory management. Are you sure? When he left, his father left him full powers. I tried to talk to the boy, but he hides. It's absurd that our survival, the factory, the families of my workers depend on an irresponsible daddy's boy. Unfortunately we pay for the weakness of a father. Let's hope that Mr. Castelli returns to Rome in time. If he is just one day late, it will be the end for us. Hi, dear. When did you come back? Now. If you were about to call Carlo, we'll see each other later. No, I was calling the History of Art teacher. -No problem. I had second thoughts. -Shall we go to dinner? -Without Dad? -He is in a meeting. -The same problem? -No! He settled that in the best of ways. I knew that Dad would come out on top. -My joy has made me hungry. -Alright. Let's go. Please, stay. I can't, Mom. Don't make our parting harder. You'll come with me one day. I am far away from here now, from the hedge where you found me when you feared I was lost. I must go. Understand? And you won't understand me, Mom. Mom, I know that you won't understand me. But the world does not end at the hedge the surrounds our home. And you won't understand me, Mom. Mom, I know that you will cry. But you cannot stop me. You taught me to walk. And now I must go. I must go. Bye, olive trees that stay here. Bye, stream that stays here. My memories, my friends, that I will never forget. My memories, my friends. Bye. And you won't understand me, Mom. Mom, I know that you won't understand, but I am already beyond the hedge, Mom, and you cannot stop me now. Maybe we should've taken a walk before going to sleep. Why? If I am disturbing you, I can go in the other room. What are you saying, kitten? You never disturb me. It's that we went to bed too early. I have a strange desire. Don't look at me with those eyes. They drive me crazy. Provolone. Why are you calling me that? You've always called me "kittycat". I want to eat provolone cheese. We just finished eating. Vegetable soup and spinach omelet. Mozzarella, ricotta, tangerines, apple cake. Love, if you're really hungry, go see what's in the refrigerator. There is everything, except provolone. And I want provolone. A craving. Understand? Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I think so, kittycat. Then it's really true. We're expecting a baby! This makes me crazy! It makes me crazy! -Then provolone must be found. -Yes. Otherwise, our child will be born with a provolone head. -What are you doing? -I'm going to buy provolone. Stores are closed. Don't touch your face with your hands! I want provolone! Yes, don't get upset. You'll have it, whatever it costs. -Where will you get it? -Our neighbors will lend it to us. We'd better not. If it is a false alarm, they'll make fun of us. It's true. What will we do? -Like this! -Like how? We'll get it secretly. -Really? -There is the connecting door. Come. You'll eat it right away. -Let's go! -Don't get agitated. Walk slowly, for the love of Saint Nicola! Slowly, walk slowly. I won't give up the Griffith-Benvenuti match. -I'm going to get a television set. -No! I won't allow you to steal from our friends. I'm not stealing it. I'm taking it. I'll see the match and put it back. It's wrong, anyway. -When does the match begin? -In ten minutes. -Then let's hurry. -Let's go. Slowly, walk slowly. Slowly. Give me your hand. You must not strain yourself. Slowly. Kittycat… Be quiet! I found the provolone cheese. These are salamis. Patience, kitten. Help me. It's heavy. I can't make it. -This is a kitchen range. -It's true. I'd mixed up the oven with the screen. I found it. -This is too heavy. -And so? Come. Get this one with the incorporated antennas. It's the same to me. What matters is seeing the boxing match. Let's go. Easy. I found the provolone. -Saint Nicola! Did you get scared? -A little. While we sleep you steal the provolone? You are not sleeping. And we didn't steal the provolone. Tomorrow morning we'd have paid. I don't know if you would've paid for the television set. No, because we'd have put it back after seeing the boxing match. Did you want to see the TV news with the provolone? You're right in thinking badly of us. It was my fault. I was craving for provolone. And you need seven kilos of provolone? If you get hungry, you'll empty out the store? I went too far, taking a whole one. I was afraid she'd crave for it again. -How long does this craving last? -Shall we tell them? Let's tell them. -We're expecting a child. -Is he coming from abroad? -No. What don't you understand? -They are expecting a child! Is he coming on a truck? She's about to become a mother. Stop. Don't move! -Don't look at him, kitten. -Why can't she look at me? -She could be frightened. -She must not look at you, either. Anyway, congratulations. Thank you very much. -Good night. -Good match. -Good night. -Good provolone. Did you get frightened, kitten? -We made a mistake. -Wrong room. Come, kitten. -A baby! -A baby! -Shall we wait two days? -Why? -Your father will return and… -Nothing! Down sell the Vivaldi shares. -It would be a loss for us. -We can afford it. Mr. Giorgio? Miss Lorena is here for you. Let her in. Maybe you're right. It's a loss for us too. Let's wait. Alright. -May I? -Come in. What a surprise! Sit down. -Something to drink? -What you're having. I wasn't expecting your visit. Well, here I am. You mean you don't hate me anymore? Love stems from hate. So suddenly? It's never too late to have second thoughts. Maybe I was wrong about you. If I didn't know you are in love with Carlo, I'd be able to hope. What if it were over with Carlo? Really? Social differences come out at a distance. Yes, like race horses. And you are a thoroughbred. I have become more woman. Falling in love is one thing, marrying is another. Rich with rich, poor with poor. -Yes. -Can we go out some time? -Of course. -Tonight? -Tomorrow. -At 9 I'll be outside your home. No, at 8 in Via Gregorio VII, 311. It's an electric appliances store. -Do you work? -No. Why should I? I work too, as you see. Work elevates man. I take lessons from the History of Art teacher. -The store belongs to her husband. -That's it. I have to go now. -See you tomorrow. -Tomorrow. I'll accompany you. -The butter must be fresh. -It is. You can still hear the cow mooing. -How much is it? -1,500 Lira. Now you must serve me, I've been waiting a half hour. -Do you want more groceries? -I shouldn't eat today? Ciccio, did you hear? Our cessionary didn't come to say hello. He didn't come to say hello? What does he want? I am here to buy groceries, as per our agreement. -You'll finish all your money. -What money? Our promissory notes that will expire in 1978. Give him what he wants. He's always starving. He'll die of hunger before the deadline. Mr. hungry man, what can I give you? Give me a liter of very pure virgin olive oil. What? A liter of very pure virgin olive oil. These are the olives. You can make a very pure virgin oil yourself. Stop it! Today we tend towards the seed. It is good for the liver and enlarges the coronaries. Alright. But this is a half-liter. Yes, but it's concentrated. -I'll make out the bill. -Just a minute! -Give me ten sausages. -One. -Seven. -Two. -Five. -Three, not one more. Three. -I'll make out the bill. -No. Give me a piece of bread, please. You're a beggar, who is asking for a piece of bread. -Do you want anything else? -300 grams of Quadrucci pasta. -Is Farfalline pasta ok? -No. -Avemaria Pasta? -No, I'm Protestant. Can't you protest elsewhere? Do you have Quadrucci or not? We have everything! I'll get it in the back room. Alright. -Did Carlo come back? -Yes, this morning at dawn. He's in his room. Go surprise him. I can't, I'm in a hurry. Could you call him? I'll go right away. Excuse me. May I have 400 grams of gruyere? -Is smoked provola alright? -No, 400 grams of gruyere. -Some mozzarella? -400 grams of gruyere. -Do you have it or not? -I have it. I'll go get it. -We already saw each other. -I greeted the young lady. Look at this Quadrucci pasta. -Marvelous. -1,220 Lira. -Where is Lorena? -Over there. -Here I am. -But… -Let me see this gruyere. -They are top quality holes. No, this isn't Swiss gruyere. What are you saying? Read here. "Made in Switzerland". Are you convinced? A beautiful song that I will sing for the first time tonight. -I want you all at Big Hut. -I can't come. -We must break up. -What are you saying? My family is going through a very difficult time. I must think of my parents. You don't think about me who loves you? You are the dearest boy in the world and I will always care for you. -Why, Lorena? -Don't ask me anything. Goodbye. Dear love, my dear love, a day is so long without you. The Summer rain is crying with me. Now I know that I live for you. Dear love, my dear love, I'd like to fly where you are to tell you that nothing is more important than you, than you, who are a part of me. She will forget you. She will forget you sooner or later. Maybe she will find, maybe she'll find another love. She will never do that. She will never do that. And I live for you. She will forget you, she will forget you sooner or later. Maybe she will find, maybe she will find another love. She will never to that. She will never do that. Dear love, my dear love, a day is so long without you. The Summer rain is crying with me. Now I know that I live for you. I must do it. Understand? But you hate him. How can you marry him? So I won't see my mother crying, and for my father. Don't you think about your happiness? Happiness doesn't exist. It used to exist, and it was called Carlo. I caused him much pain and will cause him more. I told Giorgio to come pick me up here this evening so that Carlo will see us together. I want him to despise me, to cancel me forever from his life. Do you feel like crying, girl? Cry. You will feel better. Yes, madam. Alright, madam. Of course, madam. Thank you, madam. -Who was it? -Mrs. Vezzullo. She wants 500 grams of bacon, fresh, pink and of a good weight. Did she also say she wants a surprise inside? -Good evening, madam. -Countess… I'd like some first quality smoked salmon. And two jars of authentic Russian caviar. With hammer and sickle! It is a pleasure to serve such a refined noble woman. I will take advantage of your culinary competence to have you taste some sardines for which you will give your honest opinion. -Taste. -Actually… Taste, Countess. Who doesn't accept doesn't deserve. If you insist… You see? Disgusting! And you wanted to force me to eat them. Good thing the countess tasted them. You do experiments on me? I've become your guinea pig? Poisoning criminals! I will never set foot in your store again. -Murderers! -Some bicarbonate of soda… The parmigiano cheese supply arrived. -Always at closing time! -Carlo, come down and help us. Good. He'll take his mind off Lorena. Do we have money to pay for it? Don't worry. We'll pay in time. Sure! Time is money! Here is the parmigiano. I'm going to have a coffee. Will you take a piece too? I am tired. Help me, Carlo. Hurry up. Get off. Raise it. Are you there? Are you sure? Can we let go? -I'm letting go. -Let go. Ciccio, where are you? Come on… There's lots of dough there. How can you still talk about food? I'm not talking about food. I'm talking about that son of a bi… billionaire! Where there is money, love ends. That is why Miss Lorena left Carlo. Women… Good thing we didn't get married! It was very fortunate. Also because nobody wanted us! At night I am here without asking myself why. I am thinking of my life so tied to you. It is sad to have to live just for living and talk to one who never listens. It is sad to have around many people and feel more lonely than ever. But I have you. If the world should fall… I have you. No, no, there's no doubt that I will never stay without you. When the sun will return, and in the sun I will come to you, love, love, run to me, and the night will never come again. I had never been to a drive-in. It's fun. There is no promiscuity here and nobody is watching the movie. I want to see it and hear it. Will you get the speaker? But we can't talk about ourselves. We have a lot to say. After many years of school together, I feel I don't know you. And I want to know you well! Giorgio, I won't allow it. What? "Maybe I was wrong about you." "Love stems from hate." Aren't they your words? Just because I timidly tried to get closer, you treat me like this? You said that we don't know each other. It's true. Let's try being together more, to discover each other, our best emotions. Stop with these comic strip words! Let's put things as they are. You came to me because the Vivaldi boat is in bad waters and only I can save you from sinking. But I like you. I always have. And I can't give you up, whatever the price is. You pay your price and I pay mine. For the wellbeing of my family. Alright. If you want, I am willing to marry you tomorrow. Marry me? Why should we get married? The rich marry the rich and the poor marry the poor. And you are poor, my dear! But I am ready to help your father. If you will be good with me. You scoundrel! You scoundrel! -Why are you opening? -It's 8:30. What does this knocking on my forehead mean? It means that we must close this door. Don't insinuate things! I didn't touch the provolone this time. Now I am craving for sweets. It's not a matter of not trusting you, but of cleanliness. -We wash ourselves every day. -But a dirty person is with you. -Who is that? -Who is that? A woman called Vivaldi Lorena. Don't you dare touch that angel! Don't touch the angel! -You mix up sacred and profane. -That girl is profane! It's not true! Lorena has a heart of gold. 24 carat gold. It's a stone heart and she gives it to the best offer. Close the door. -Franco, don't close it. -We want an explanation and apology. Apology, no. Explanation, yes. -Then explain! -Then explain. From one day to the next, Miss Lorena left the man she loved to go to the man she hated. -Did we explain well? She did it for a noble cause. We can't understand, we are Plebeians. -If I tell you, you will cry. -Have us cry. We've laughed enough. If I told you that Lorena… Tell us! -I promised to be silent. -She promised to be silent. Great excuse! Close it, Franco. -Back up. -What manners! How dare you? Grocers! -Board it, Ciccio. -Open! Open! Open! Kitten, don't strain yourself. Open! Will you open? -A sandwich with "coppa", please. -Come back later. -Why? -It's closed for renovation works. They gave up. How they defended that deplorable girl! To defend the girl's honor, we must tell you everything. -We must tell everything. -Tell us everything. Giorgio Castelli, rejected by Lorena, who is in love with Carlo, deplorably blackmailed her by pushing her father to bankruptcy. To save her family from being ruined, she is willing to marry him. That is the situation. -Where is he going? -I don't know. Let's follow him. -We'll follow him too. -Easy. -Don't get upset. -You're right. -Where is he going? -Let's follow him. We'll follow him too. Come on! Wait! I must close. -Where are you going? -To Castelli's. -How should I announce you? -As you wish. -One moment! -Are you telling us or him? -All three. -He's telling all three, not us. One moment! Where are you going? -And where are you going? -Where he's going. -And where is he going? -To tell Castelli what he deserves. To give! Just as we thought. -What is going on? -Nothing, a small discussion. A little animated. Where is Carlo? Inside? What is he doing? He is fixing things up with the gentleman. Easy, kitten. Keep away! Let's hear. What is going on? Nothing. Mr. Giorgio is taking Judo lessons. Inside! Inside, girls, inside! -Kittycat, let's go. -Where? To settle accounts with his father. -Let's go. -We'll be right back. -How did you get in? -From the door. -The door. -I don't have the pleasure of… -The pleasure is ours. -May I sit down? Of course you can. He would never leave a lady standing. I would like to know the reason for your visit. We'll tell you right away. Will you do it? Your son is a scoundrel. Everything is ok. Knockout. -How did it go? -We won. Let's go. Hurry! -Where're you going? The lady first. -Thank you. It's my fault. I made a mistake. You still have a lot to learn from life. You will apologize to Mr. Vivaldi, who besides being among the most honest industrialists, is a gentleman. A gentleman, Giorgio! A word that is becoming rare. And that you must learn about before sitting in that chair. Ferretti, as of this moment, you will be vice-president. One day, you'll wake up and realize that the world is in your hands, and that now you are somebody. It's enough to raise a finger and you have all that you want. Everything is easy, dreams have become reality. But I wouldn't want all the gold in the world in exchange for you, who sits there and waits for me to remember you. But what is all the gold in the world, compared to you who loves me? Me! Forgive me if I left you here crying for me. I was flying high, you know? I was far away from you. But I wouldn't want all the gold in the world in exchange for you, who sits there waiting for me to remember you. But what is all the gold in the world compared to you who loves me? Me! Carlo Carrera, do you take, as your lawful-wedded wife, the here present Lorena Vivaldi, according to the ritual of Holy Mother Church? Lorena Vivaldi, do you take, as your lawful-wedded husband, the here present Carlo Carrera, according to the ritual of Holy Mother Church? Now take your right hand. I declare you united in marriage, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Franco… Are you sure we were right in not getting married? We wouldn't have gotten along. THE END
