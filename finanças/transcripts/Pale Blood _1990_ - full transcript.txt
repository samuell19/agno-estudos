Arriving passenger Michael fury to the courtesy phone, please. Call for Michael fury. Thank you. This is Michael fury. Mr. fury, I have a message from Lori, who says she's from the detective agency? Yes. She's unable to meet you but asked that you join her at Metropolis, a store on Melrose Avenue? Do you know where that is? I'll find it. Have you got your passport? That's the fifth time you've asked me that. Remember when you tried to go to Missouri and you left... Yes, yes, yes. The Metropolis on Melrose. J close your eyes, remember me from long ago j never say a word, no one will ever know j I'll think of life the way it was before j imagine what the future has in store for you j I'll take the time to waste 1,000 years j touch the face, wipe away the tears j stab the back, bite the hand that feeds Come on, there it is back there, come on! Come on, guys, let's go. Vampire city, come on, let's do it. Get me some light. Oh, wow. All right, come on in tight. Starting tight on her and then pull back and open up to include me. Get him outta here, will ya? Police, move aside. This is frazer Kelly, I'm reporting live from Metropolis a Melrose Avenue lingerie boutique and a scene of yet another grizzly feast by the vampire killer. Less than 10 minutes ago, I received an anonymous tip at the channel 3 news desk. The shocking tip told me that one of the mannequins was not a mannequin at all, but a corpse, and very likely the vampire killer's victim number three. We've arrived here before the police to bring you this exclusive. You must be Michael fury. I'm Lori, from the agency. The one you've been corresponding with. I'm really sorry I couldn't meet you at the airport. I got a hot tip from a friend of mine and I came right down here. Looks like another one. You are Michael fury, aren't you? The one who's been paying me to investigate these so-called vampire murders? That's right. You had me scared there for a minute. It's just like the others. Someone is using sharpened incisors to bite into the necks of the victims, and all the blood is drained out. But there's no evidence, there's never any evidence. And they appear no closer to solving the hideous crimes. - I see. - Now, here tonight. Another victim. This is frazer Kelly for channel 3 news. Now back to the studio. Well, my car is right here. Why don't I take you to your condo? That really freaked me out. I don't even wanna eat dinner. I tell you, it makes me worry about you walking out here by yourself. Don't think I'm gonna work here anymore. Yes, ma'am? Fill it up, please? And the victims are apparently killed someplace else. Maybe the same place every time. And then they're brought to the place where they're found and the rest you know from my letters. You want a coke? Anyway, I found a great place for you while you're here. It's a brand new condo. It's unfurnished. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Have you seen it? I spent a whole day and night there. Really? Well, after all our correspondence, I kinda felt like I knew you. My letters were very business-like, as I recall. I know, but I like to read between the lines. I made up a whole personality for you. I sat in your place, wondering how you'd decorate the living room, which bedroom you'd pick to sleep in, what your bed would look like, things like that. What do you do in the agency? Research assistant on the graveyard shift. All those summaries you sent me were unusually thorough. Well, I'm very interested in the occult. Not just vampires, a lot of things. Actually, I'm kind of a joke around the office, so when your first letter came in, they kinda thought... They thought we deserved each other. I've read all the vampire books. Seen just about every vampire movie ever made. Wouldn't it be incredible if there really was a vampire behind all this? You know, a lot of people think it's possible. Because of the puncture wounds in the throats of the three dead girls? Well, you saw them. They looked just like fang bites and everyone knows vampires must kill to live. I think people do see too many movies. Why must what you call a vampire kill? Why couldn't they take just enough blood to exist? And let their quarry live. Quarry? That's an interesting way of putting it. I'm tired. I'd like to get to the apartment. Michael? What are you really looking for? I'm looking for a killer. Nice slow pan from Billy blue shirt, and hold, beat. Beat. Now nice slow zoom, real slow, real slow, yeah. That's good. Good. Yeah. Now, pull back real slow, yes, real slow. Hell, somethin' moved down there, I know it did. Looking for something? Jesus Christ, man, you scared the shit outta me. Are you a cop? Are you a cop? Something happening down there? No, nothing's happening down there. Why are you filming nothing? Look, first of all, this isn't film. It's videotape, all right? Second of all, I'm an artist, I don't have to explain to you or anybody else in the world what I'm doing. Huh, art. But there's nothing happening down there. You'd be surprised what you can do in the editing process. Bam. What's your video about? It's a goddamn documentary, all right? About the murders? Yeah. About the murders. I mean, why else would I be here, at this hour, freezing my ass off, huh? And listen, don't try and rip me off, all right? That happened to me once before, and I didn't take kindly to it, you understand? First they steal your ideas, then your creativity, and then goes your bank book. And I tell you wha... Jesus. Now, was that strange or was that strange? Oh, man. I don't know. Jesus Christ. Get a hold of yourself, man. Just get a hold of yourself. Hey, watch out! Geez! Van! Not tonight. Van, honey, you're almost an hour late. Let's go, inside. Now suddenly he's in a big hurry. Maybe we should think about this? What're you, crazy? I told you this was easy money. Besides, we'll go to drac's after. We'll have a really good time. No, forget it, um, I'm leaving! Just tell Van I lost my nerves, okay? Oh, come on, don't be a chickenshit, please! I am chickenshit and I'll wait for you at drac's tonight, okay? Bye, baby! J right from the beginning j clouds begin to pour j but we were all too young to fear the power of the storm j if we had lost our hopes we knew our j dreams would still remain j because nothing is impossible j nothing burns like fire in the rain j fire in the rain j thunder rocked the mountains j lightning cracked the sky j no one that survived this hurricane would dare deny j if fate had played it's part j there would be nothing to explain j what was once a very tiny spark j is now a blazing fire in the rain j fire in the rain j rain J now see the sun coming out j from behind the darkest clouds j say goodbye to the storm j as it moves across the sky j see the fire burning brighter than it ever has before j moving close, touch the flame j burn like fire in the rain j fire in the rain j fire in the rain j fire in the rain J I've heard that voice before somehow j can't imagine j it speaks words without knowing what they mean j and I've seen that face before somewhere j can't remember j it seems as if it happened in a dream j I laugh and now you know j that some things never change j I laugh again because to me you seem j so strange j so strange j so strange Michael? I took a chance you might still be awake. Come onin. I do my best work at night. Do you want a glass of wine? No, thank you. Your last letter said you were arranging a list of suspects. I have friends in high places. Well, a couple anyway. There's over 2,000 names on that list. Amazing. What a city. Only the first they have records of kinkiness. L.A. you know. Any conclusions? None that you'd be interested in. Try me. Not one of them is a vampire. You're right. That doesn't interest me. But you're the believer. What makes you so sure? None of them have been seen in daylight. Oh, yes. The lore. Can't be seen in mirrors, afraid of garlic. All those sorts of things. Is that a smile? You're really obsessed with this vampire business. Put my personal beliefs aside for a second, I also happen to be a damn good investigator. And rule one is, you work from a theory that fits the facts. Now, the facts are, we've got a killer running around, who drains his victim of blood. Now, what are the possibilities? Who drinks blood? Nobody said the killer drinks the blood. Puncture wounds? - Just kinkiness. - No. Rule two is you don't alter the facts to fit the theory. The facts say vampire. Look, the victims' bodies are still at the morgue, right? As far as I know. Well, doesn't legend say that the vampire's victim becomes a vampire? That depends. Look, the dead are dead, no matter how they got that way. Dead and that's all. Do you know that some people believe that the spirit hangs around for a while? That if you can get in touch with them, they can tell you things? I suppose you're one of the people who believes that? Actually, I am trying to get in touch with them. Maybe one of the murder victims can tell me something. I need someone to investigate the living. Let's stick to reality. There are all kinds of reality. Good luck. Let me know when the spirits talk to you. You're funny, huh? I didn't mean to make fun of you, but you must admit it's a little bizarre. That's okay, it was worth it just to see you smile again. I should go. Really? So soon? Why don't you stay and watch some of this movie with me? More vampires? No, thank you. When will I see you again? I'll call you in a day or two. Jet lag. Tell me something. What're you gonna do with your vampire, if you find him? I don't know. Goodnight. Lori. Up and at 'em, morning glory. Look, I brought you some groceries. Oh, listen, I'm sorry that we didn't make it to drac's last night. You know Van, one thing led to another and, well, we never made it out of the house. Jenny, it's almost 8:30. Don't you have to be at work? Jenny? Jenny. Jenny? Jenny? Jenny, Jenny! Oh, god, you scared me. Well, listen, I brought some groceries. Breakfast in 15 minutes? The thing about him is his eyes. The way they look at you. It's kind of hypnotic, you know? Oh, brother, are you gone. Michael fury, huh? That's a nice name. So, when are you gonna see Mr. fury again? Um... Tonight at drac's. No, you're not. You promised me that you'd do the video with me and Van! No more, cherry. But he's a famous artist and I promised him! He's using us. He just got some kind of big Grant, he's rich! He's weird. Will you at least come along and keep me company? Please? You've won $1,000! - Oh, my god! - You've won $1,000! No way. The station that just loves to give you money! And now for all you people sitting in that big gridlock called the 405, here's Jay Willis! The number two Lane closed for a couple minutes on transition, harbor northbound to the Santa Monica westbound. Oh, that's good. Very good, yes, I like that. Huh, open up, open up. Yes. That's nice. Wet your lips, you make me, I'll tell ya. What's this thing here? That's a vampire hunting sword, 16th century. Just put it down, put it down. Thank you, step away. Very good. Right there, right there, yes. On, the lick, yes, lick it. Beautiful. Just move around, scoot around. That's good, yes, yes. "Woman found dead. "Blood drained." Oh, here's one about the third victim. Metropolis, two nights ago. Oh, gorgeous. Yes, that's good. Do you think maybe it's really a vampire? Vampires. Right. Well, you know, Van's great-great grandmother was a vampire hunter. Get out, there's no such thing. Jenny, babe, try not to comment on things you know absolutely nothing about, all right? Come here. Let me have the chicken. You've had enough to eat, all right? You're always eatin', sit down. Okay, now look at me, look at me. My god, girls. Do you see the, listen to me. Look at me, look at me, look at me, good. Jenny, just take your finger. Look at me. Thank you, take your finger and just, very lightly, with your fingernail, touch the egg. The egg. - The egg's over here. Come on. Good, now just hold it right there. Hold on, hold on. - That's tickles. - Don't move, don't move. - Your hands are freezing. - Just touch it. - My hands are greasy. - For Christ sakes. Just touch the egg! Take your index finger. Gently... Oh, this could get weird. Take your index finger, not on foot, on the egg. Very good, right there, now just hold it. Oh, that's good, don't wipe it off, don't wipe it off. Don't wipe it, oh no, back off, back off! Hold it right there. Hold that, hold that, hold your leg, hold your leg! God, yes, absolute master. The curves. The texture, shadows, texture shadows. Tantalizing ambiguities. This is fantastic. A little love in the fast Lane from bill cool. The afternoon commute home, Tom? Pauline, southbound 55 there's an accident in the number two Lane. Hot new group, durango 95! The darkness is his domain. To be seen yet unseen is no difficult task, for one such as he. The shadow you thought you did not see flitting against the walls of your darkened bedroom. It was there. The sound you could almost hear! His voice in another form! Yes. The hiss of distant snakes. Though his power over beasts is great, it is not limitless. No, sadly, no. Certain animals do not obey him. Indeed, would hurt him, if they could! Small dogs. Especially pekingese, dachshunds, cocker spaniels! They are more to my liking. The blood is the life. In truth, his blood is pale as water. Pale blood. Pale blood. Hey, Lori. Are you okay? Yeah. Let's go sit down. Though his powers are greater than his limitations, the night only is his, yet how completely he dominates the darkness. He can become shadow itself and flow through windows, like water through cloth! To be heard, yet unheard. His voice in another form. Yes, the hiss of... - Hi, Jenny. - Hi. - Distant snakes! The blood is the life. I was afraid you wouldn't come. I'm here. We spent this wonderful night together. There are so many things I want to know about you. Jenny. Michael, I think I'm falling in love with... Jenny. Listen to me. You don't know me. You don't who I am, or what I am. I can't let myself love. Anyone. So, please. No more questions. Jenny. So? So what? Are you going to give me your telephone number or not? Barkeep, double scotch, rocks,. Van, Van, there's Jenny. - Where? - Sittin' right over there. Jenny, Jenny. Just the girl I wanna see. Hi, Jenny. - Hi, Jenny. Hi, have you met Michael fury? How is the video going? It's goin'. So listen, do you mind if we join you? No, look, we gotta go. Wait a minute, we just got here. You wanna stay here, you stay, I got work to do. Van! Damn it, every time I turn around. Who was that? I told you he was weird. Listen, I don't wanna hear it right now, okay? I've gotta go. Hey, but what about tonight? I mean, we're supposed to... Maybe later, huh? Would you like a drink? No, I'll get it myself, thanks. Tell me about him. Van? He's an artist, I've been doing a video with him. Really? I'd like to see it. Oh, god, no, you wouldn't wanna see any of that stuff. Why not? It's an erotic video. I wouldn't want you to think of me that way. I don't. Where is it? I know what I saw, I know it's here somewhere. Come on, Van, it's the big time now. There. There it is, right there. "Van vandameer. "Date of birth, October 17th, 1945. "Place of birth, peoria, Illinois. "Criminal record, none. "Medical history. "Three instances of psychiatric confinement. "Memberships and associations.

There. My god, now you see him, now you don't. Nobody moves that fast. Nobody. Oh, Jesus, Van, you got yourself a vampire. Damn it, this is the kind of thing that happens when your dreams come true, this... Sure, fight him with a piece of wood. Stupid. You know what he's doing, he's using Jenny. He's using her to watch over me. Son of a bitch. You just don't understand. You're a beautiful girl, full of energy. So beautiful. You're so young. You have so much life to look forward to. Do you really wanna see Van's tapes? I can get some of them for you, do you want me to? No. I can handle it myself. I would do anything for you. You know that, don't you? I know. How did you get in here? I, uh, I rented this condo for you, remember? I got the keys. What's in the suitcase? I'm not paying your agency to investigate me. Shouldn't you be looking for a murderer? I am looking for a murderer. Meaning what? I'm a suspect? Everyone's a suspect. Spoken like a master detective. I don't think this is funny. I did a computer search on you. You don't exist. Computers makes mistakes. If I were the killer, why would I hire you? Maybe you want someone to uncover evidence you left behind. No, my letters came from Europe. That could be arranged. You're actually serious. You're not a killer. Then what are you searching for? I was hoping you were the real thing. "The real thing?" You know what I mean. What luck. I come all this way, and all I get are hallucinations. Crazy people. What hallucinations? Nevermind. Forget it. Please, Michael, I need to know, what are you seeing? What I'm seeing is none of your business. No, it is, you see I'm causing what you're seeing! No. No, you don't have that kind of power, you can't. How do you know? Because it's just not possible. It is possible. I've been working for those visions, you see? Only, they've been coming to you! If that's true, what you're doing is extremely dangerous. You're playing with things you know nothing about. Leave the dead alone! Michael, please. I need to know what you're seeing. Blood, I'm seeing blood. Sometimes I think I'm going mad. Satisfied? You're not mad, Michael. I don't know what you are, but you're not mad. I'm far from home. Far from home. And I'm tired. I need to rest. No. No! No! Stop! Michael? Michael? Michael. Right now for you early risers, it's music... In Los Angeles, the weather for the southland is more of the same, low clouds here this morning, hot and smoggy but sunny this afternoon. Highs generally in the mid-80s in the downtown area... It's going to be busy on the Santa Monica freeway east and westbound, a lot of heavy traffic this morning on the Santa Monica freeway. Had an earlier accident, eastbound, before the harbor area in the fast Lane. That has been cleared, southbound on the 405. J love is just a fable oh, Michael. J and a wrung out fantasy j you made me able j to look deeper right into me j I know the consequence And potentially lethal shellfish from Washington state, the scallops contain vasotoxin. That's a naturally-occurring poison that can cause... And Cincinnati, five-nothing. Chicago four, Philadelphia one. Montreal took Pittsburgh five-four in 11 innings, and the mets ended their seven game losing streak. Van? Is anybody home? Hi, um, um... How you doin"? I was, oh god, you scared me, I was looking for cherry. Ah. It's amazing, you know, I was just thinking about you. It's like you're reading my mind. Anyhow, cherry won't be back for a little while. - I really gotta go now. - No, you know what? I have something I wanna show ya. No, I really gotta go, Van. No, look, it won't take long at all, it's beautiful. Very special. So, how you doin'? - Fine. - Are you well? - Uh-huh. - You look so pretty today. - Thank you. Will this take long? Jenny, you could be a star. With such pretty eyes. I want you to trust me. Come on. Go on. What's that awful smell? Garlic. I painted 60 gallons of garlic juice on all the walls. Well, I mean almost all of 'em. Vampires? Are you trying to keep vampires out? No. I'm trying to keep a vampire from getting out. Oh. So, where is the vampire? Hey, don't look at me. - No? I came here in bright sunshine. And garlic, and crosses, don't do a thing to me. Nothin', huh? Well, you see, the vampire's not here yet. - "Yet?" - Yet. But don't worry. He's comin'. Gonna be here real soon. Look, Van, that's real interesting, but... Oh, do you what's interesting? Look right up there, right there. And over there, and right behind ya. I don't see anything. Well look, right there, it's a hidden video camera. You see, first of all, I'm gonna capture the vampire, then I'm gonna tape him feeding, and then I'm gonna become the most famous artist in America. I mean, it's one, it's two, it's three. That's a very clever idea, Van. I know, very clever, huh? - But I really... - No, no, Jenny, Jenny. You're so cold, so cold. What's the matter, you think I'm gonna steal your purse, hm? Hey. Are you feeling guilty, hm? - Guilty about what? - "Guilty about what?" About this. About swiping my tapes for your boyfriend. You think I'm stupid? You think I'm dumb? You think I'm retarded? Don't you think I know what you and that blood sucker are up to? What're you talking about? Michael fury, that's what I'm talking about. That blood sucker. - Are you crazy or what? - Oh, yeah? I'm crazy, I'm fucking crazy! I'm crazy like a fox. I had a plan all laid out, where these murders were gonna look like the work of a vampire. - Did you kill those? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I killed them and believe me, it wasn't easy. 'Cause those things don't come that good to me. 'Cause you see, vampires, they're so lonely, and they keep searching and searching, and searching for their own kind. You're crazy! I'm crazy. Your boyfriend fell right into the trap. You're cra zy! I'm crazy. The Mark of the beast. I'm c razy? Look at me. Look at Mel I'm right, I'm fuckin' right! I'm crazy. I'm right! No, no, no, no, don't fret, don't fret. How you doin'? Look what I got for ya. You know what this is? This is the upper jaw of a Mexican vampire bat, huh? Fitting, isn't it? Please, Van. Now, don't you worry, don't you worry. This isn't gonna hurt you one little bit. Oh-ho, Jesus! Oh, we got gusher. Oh, Christ. Okay, you're fine. Hold that, hold that, good. Just like Texas, you see. The jugular's the one you want to hit. Of course, your boyfriend was a little kinky. He wasn't all that efficient. God. It's ironic, isn't it? I mean, I actually know how to do this better than he does. Funny. No? Okay, well we're gonna get you lookin' real pretty. Fix that little bow of yours, straighten this out for your boyfriend, okay, huh? Here, hold still, hold still. Very good, mm-hm. Of course, you're not gonna be much use to him all empty, so, uh, I think there's gonna be just enough left to whet his appetite, for the meal to come. Just a little bit more, we're almost done, all right? Oh, Jenny. Sorry about that. What? Oh, no, no, this is wine. I take the blood out, I certainly don't drink it. Here's to you, brother. I'm not your brother. Well, we are a little touchy this evening, aren't we, Mr. fury? Why did you kill her? It wasn't necessary. Look, you might wanna do things half-assed, but if somebody's gonna do somethin' right, they should do it right. You killed them all. Of course I did. And I've got videotape of it, it's brilliant. I drained each one of them bloodless. Just like you'd have done it. I haven't killed in a very long time. Well, that's a goddamn shame. I mean, it's therapeutic as hell. God. You must be so lonely. So lonely. There are not many of you left, are there? You're right, there are few of us left. Now all I find are perverts. Perverts? And madmen, like you. "Madmen." You shouldn't have killed her. J think of things that made you cry when you were young j realize at last your life has just begun j think of lonely places far away j I'm sorry but I don't know what to say yeah, yeah. He's the real McCoy and you, Van, you, my man, are the one who caught him. Oh, my god, no. Sweet Jesus! Easy now. God, he is real. J close your eyes, remember me from long ago j never say a word, no one will ever know j I'll think of life the way it was before j imagine what the future has in store for you j I'll take the time to waste 1,000 years j touch the face, wipe away the tears j speak the truth, break the heart that bleeds j stab the back, bite the hand that feeds Oh, shit. Damn it. Oh, come on, Van, maintain your vigil. You know, who knows, man, don't know what that beast'll do. No, Lori. No. No, Lori. No! Cherry? About time. Dinner. Cherry? J cherry j cherry pie j oh cherry? Cherry! Voodoo Van? Jesus. Who the hell are you, what're you doing here? I'm here to see Jenny. You're a friend of Jenny's? Sort of. Well, that's very coincidental, isn't it? I'm just waiting for another friend of Jenny's. I know you, don't I? Yeah, I've seen you someplace. You're a friend of cherry's, right? - No. - No? I'm sorry, what's your name? Lori. Lori, I'm Van. My god, you'd be perfect. For what? You're not gonna believe this, but uh, I'm doing a film and cherry was supposed to play the role, but she didn't show up. You're absolutely perfect for the part. - Really? - Uh-huh. What part? Well, it's the star of the fim. Hasn't Jenny told you about this? - Oh, yeah, I think she did. - You know who I am, right? And you know what I do, right? - Video artist, right? - Right, right. Well, Lori, let me tell you, whoever plays that role is gonna end up very famous. - Really? - Uh-huh. Famous? Oh, yeah, famous. Can I see Jenny now? Yeah. So I bet you're wondering what this film is about, right? - Oh, yeah. - But you know what? I don't know about you but I'm so sick of the male-dominated superiority in this business. The only thing that's respected about a woman is the size of her breasts, or the amount of blood that you can throw all over her. Come on, really, where is Jenny? "Where's Jenny." Step right in, my dear. Welcome to fame and fortune. No closer. I knew it. I knew it from the moment I met you. Don't. Don't look at me that way. I never really believed this would happen for me. I wish we had never met. You don't mean that. God look at her, she acts like she has no will of her own. Oh, yes, that's nice. Vampire foreplay. Go on, go on, bite her, bite. No, damn it, you gotta bite her! Yeah, maybe now. Maybe, come on, bite her. Yes, yes, once in the thrall of the beast, you're a blood slave, nothing more. But he hasn't even bitten her yet. Yeah, maybe now. Maybe he'll bite her now. Oh, my god. She's one of 'em, too. I couldn't have hoped. Never go away. You need blood. Oh, my god. Son of a bitch! Jesus. What a fuckin' nightmare. No! No! Sit down, gentlemen. Please, please sit down. What you are about to see is one of the most dramatic pieces of video art that has ever been created. Mr. oswald, will you please hold still? It is a work of true conviction, of true commitment, and years and years of single-minded dedication. Now, you might ask, "what is conviction?" Conviction is sacrifice. "What is commitment?" Commitment is sacrifice! "What is dedication?" Dedication is sacrifice. And finally, you might say... Dr. lang to orthopedics, west wing. Dr. lang to orthopedics, west wing. And no one, gentlemen, no one understands that better than me. There, that's your key scene, Mr. oswald! Now, pay attention, 'cause they can screw with these tapes magnetically. Oh, yeah, they can do that. Yeah, see, see? Bullet hits, right through the chest, but it doesn't matter. You can shoot these son of a bitches all day long. What's the matter, am I boring you? Well, how's this, huh, look what they did to me. These are vampire bites! No, no, no, please don't take 'em. I'm just gettin' to the primo stuff.
