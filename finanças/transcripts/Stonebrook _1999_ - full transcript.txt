[LIGHTER CLICKS] ERIK: A good man once said that to make a mistake is human. To make the same mistake again is character. Character, it was just a word. See, I had ambitions. I was full of dreams. All my life, people told me I had potential. And not long ago, I had everything I had ever wanted. I thought I wanted. I grew up on a farm near a small town. You probably never heard of it. My father wasted his life working the same 160 acres of worthless land. After he died and the bank foreclosed, it was as if my father had never existed. I vowed that my life was gonna be different. But, next thing I knew, five years had passed, and I was still working in the fields of that same small town. - I was 23. - MAN: See you, Erik. Then one day an old friend of the family promised me that if I got accepted to Stonebrook University, he would find me a scholarship. The least I could do was take the tests and apply. And then a funny thing happened.

You see, I'm--I'm developing a new mathematical model, and, uh, I--I-- I'm using a rather interesting technique to gather data. See, I've taken games like roulette and blackjack, and I've placed them up on the internet where thousands of people can play them everyday. So... So you're runnin' some kind of computer casino. No, no. The games are just data. [STAMMERING] We get about 900 hits a day and what that's providing is... Well, how much do you take in a night? Well, people don't play too conservatively, sitting alone in front of their computer. I'd say, uh, 20, - maybe 30,000... - $30,000? And you still need funding? Well, I'm not actually charging them. Why the hell not? Well, people don't play too conservatively. Mr. Dardinell, I'm a researcher, not a pit boss.

That there was a nice man who was going to take care of us. We waited all day at the train station. He never showed. Then my father found us, brought us back home. Six months later, my mom was here. You never found out who the guy was? Mmm-mmm. Your father must have some idea. Hey, hey! Watch it! Jeez! I don't want to study. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Then don't. We could go to The Top of the Hill.

You know he's blackmailin' Tali? Is that what's in the envelope? Ah. Yeah, we've been pretty sure that Tali's been laundering money through several businesses. Maybe Rosewood caught him skimmin' the till. What if I can get you Rosewood's records? You think the D.A. would be interested? I think the D.A. would pimp his mother for Rosewood's records. ERIK: The last person I wanted to see again that night was Alexander Tali, but it was clear that the only way to Rosewood's files [DOOR CLOSING] was through him. After all, the idea of stealing them had been Tali's in the first place. ♪[MUSIC PLAYING] She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah, she is. She left home when she was 16. Took her mother's name.

And always, behind these tragic events, lies the question, why? Because it is the nature of the human mind to bring order out of chaos, to seek truth. And where there is no truth, we must invent it. Because that, too, is our nature. You know, what burns me is that we're stickin' our necks out here, and there's nothin' in it for us. CORNELIUS: We stay out of jail. I just can't stop thinkin' about that briefcase. I mean, if we're goin' for the files already, it wouldn't be all that hard for us... Don't be stupid. See, the way I figure it, if Franklin makes his bust, then everyone's either gonna get nailed, turn state's, or they're gonna run for cover, right? Maybe. So do you think in all that confusion that they're gonna miss one little briefcase full of money? If we screw up, we're dead. [SCOFFS] If we screw up, we're dead anyway. I don't understand. [CHUCKLES] It's ergonomic. I thought it might be good for your wrists. [WOMAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO] May I ask you a question, Erik? Yeah, sure. Why are you wasting your time working for a man like Tali? [LAUGHING] Money, of course. If you're gonna be in this line of work, do it with the right people. I have contacts, Erik. Serious contacts. Is that so? In fact, my employers will be in town on Wednesday. If you like, I could introduce you. I'll think about it. What else was on the desk? Usual stuff. Phone, paper, box of blank disks. Couple of pens. Oh, and there was a police band radio. Police band? Good. That's good. Did you set up the keyboard exactly like I told you? Yeah. And you're sure the meeting is day after tomorrow? Mmm-hmm. Wednesday. Londyn always visits her mom on Wednesday. Okay. Well, I made up our itinerary, and our first stop is 133 miles down route 24. The motel is called The Comfort Lodge. Erik, are you listenin'? Yeah. I just don't see why we have to skip town. Erik, if we steal this money, they will come lookin' for us. Oh, I know. It's--It's just... Hey! Hey! Where are you goin'? I can't leave town without talkin' to Londyn. Erik, she's his daughter, okay? If you talk to her, you risk blowin' everything. I'm sorry. WOMAN: [ON RADIO] Unit two-niner, standing by. FRANKLIN: All right. Copy that. So, Erik, look. If anything goes wrong, - I want you to head straight to... - Franklin! Relax. All right? Just stick with the plan. Right. Right. - Hey, what about our records? - They're clean just as soon as I put the disk in the D.A.'s hands. So, Erik, just please - be careful. - Franklin, we're gonna meet back here in an hour. All right? Right. ♪ In the sweet by and by ♪ We will meet on... We should've had Tali pay us in advance. Don't get greedy, Erik. [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Who's this? - He's with me. Listen, we've got trouble. Alexander Tali's comin' after you. You're gonna have to get out of town. Tali knows he can't touch me. TALI: Because there aren't going to be any more payments to Mr. Rosewood. ERIK: But his records. He could send... No, he can't send them if he's dead. I'm afraid Mr. Tali just met with a most unfortunate accident. [SIGHS] Sorry. Uh, what're you gonna do? Include these files with the shipment. It's all here. Every dime he's embezzled. ERIK: How much has he stolen? Just shy of $2 million. ROSEWOOD: He's kept it well hidden. Probably stashed it offshore. You might wanna take a look at this. What is it? Well, it looks like a cop. ROSEWOOD: The police! [SWITCH CLICKING] COP 1: [ON RADIO] 297, what's your 20? COP 2: [ON RADIO] Corner of Main and Willow. Awaiting further instructions. Over. COP 3: Fireman's Park is secure. Yeah, roger that. All units hold positions. They've got the whole neighborhood staked out. Hey, Franklin, can you run down that description again? Yeah. Subject's name, Elmer Clancy Rosewood, 6'2", Caucasian... FRANKLIN: ...balding, drives an orange 911... [CLICK] Why would Tali go to the police? Maybe he's connected. I have to get to the warehouse. Well, they'll arrest you the second you walk out the door. You could go. What? ROSEWOOD: They're not looking for you. What about that cop outside? I could-- I could create a diversion. I could-- I could take your car and--and maybe stall 'em. The meeting is at a warehouse. 427 3rd Street. You can't miss it. Do you have any blank disks? On the desk. Why? Oh, I have to make the--the diversion as convincing as possible. Oh, right. Um, here's... The car is in the garage. Good luck. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Come on. Come on. ERIK: Follow him. It's working. I gotta get goin'. - Erik? - Yeah? What you're doing for me, I'll make it worth your while. I know you will. ERIK: It was beautiful. We had the disk, we had the money. I felt myself breathe for the first time in days. Of course, we still needed the password. But according to Cornelius, that was simple. See, there were two disks. The first held all of Rosewood's files. All the evidence the D.A. could want. The second came from a homemade device which Cornelius had rigged into the keyboard I planted on Rosewood's desk. It recorded every keystroke, which could then be printed out. And from there, finding the password was just a process of elimination. Then Cornelius would hand the disk and password over to Franklin, who would give it to the D.A., [BLEEPING] who would drop the charges and clean our records. All I had to do was get myself and the money out of Stonebrook. ERICK: Can't leave town without talkin' to Londyn. CORNELIUS: Erik, she's his daughter. If you talk to her, you risk blowing everything. I'm sorry. I don't know. You ever get to a point in your life where you're not movin' forward anymore, or you're just kind of standin' still? LONDYN: Yeah. Yeah, well, I don't ever wanna get to that point again. "Irene was devastated. She knew that Maurice was her destiny. "Her one chance at true love, "and he had left her for money." I did what you said. Cornelius and I cut a deal with the cops. We're gettin' out. So I see. Well, call the department if you need to. Ask for Detective Franklin. Detective Oliver Franklin. Oliver? Mom, what's wrong? It's time to go, Londyn. There's someone I've been waiting to introduce you to. ♪ In the sweet by and by ♪ We shall meet ♪ On that beautiful shore ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ In the sweet Franklin. ♪ ...by and by - LONDYN: What? - ♪ We shall meet - Franklin. Hold on to this. - What? But I... Keep it safe. I can't explain. Erik, wait! ERIK: You never found out who the guy was? Your father must have some idea. TALI: He's worked for me ever since. He runs errands, works for scraps. I own him. About time you got here. [DOOR CLOSING]ERIK: Cornelius! Cornelius! [EXPLOSION] Erik! MAN: Come on! [ERIK GRUNTING] ERIK: [SCREAMING] Get off of me! Aah! - Is the other one dead? - Yeah. Good. Get the briefcase. [GRUNTS] It's not here. Excuse me? It's not here! I should've known you'd screw this thing up. But I got the disk and the password. You got Rosewood where you want him. What is the password? Pandora. Cute. - Where's the briefcase? - Go to hell! [GROANS] [ERIK COUGHING] TALI: Where's the briefcase? Franklin? Franklin? I'm sorry, kid. [GRUNTING IN PANIC] All right! Okay, okay! All right. [PANTING] It's off Route-- Route 24, in the woods. - Where in the woods? - In the woods. Where in the woods? I'd have to show you. You'll be late for your meeting. How much money were we talking about? $50,000, maybe $60,000. Okay. Okay, I can cover that if I have to. - Yeah, I'll take the kid and get the money. - No. No, you stay here, you move these cars. It looks like a used-car lot. You think you can handle that? TALI: Good. Let's go. Let's go! MAN: Get in! [CAR DOOR CLOSING] [DOG BARKING] So, Rosewood asked you to come in his place. TALI: Uh, well, yes. Because the police were following him. We just thought it would be safer for me to come a-and meet you. And our shipment? Oh, I--I wired it, uh, offshore for safety. You wired it? - That's right. - To an offshore account? That's right. That's very good, Mr. Tali. Our employer will be most pleased. TALI: Thank you. Now, - call your bank. - Right. - Have them wire the funds to our account. - Of course. TALI: Excuse me. [DIALING] ERIK: We made it so easy. All the time we thought we were playing Tali, and he was playing us. Uh, I'd like to arrange an electronic transfer of funds. Right. It started with the deliveries to Rosewood, right through to planning Franklin's phony bust. He was even willing to hand over his own money. All for Rosewood's files. See, the disk didn't just free Tali from Rosewood, it gave him power. Uh... [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] I--I seem to have forgotten the exact dollar amount. $1,842,129. Excuse me? Is there a problem? No. No, no--no problem at all. I just happened to forget the exact dollar amount. $1,842,129. They--They wanna know where--where it's going. Transfer the funds to El Banco Nacional in Buenos Aires, to 51427638. They need your password. Yes, of course. Uh, yes, the password is "Londyn." L-O-N-D-Y-N. That's right. Thank you. It's done. You know, if there is one thing our employer hates, it is seeing a valuable resource wasted. I'll tell you what. He's gonna be passing through town tonight. Why don't you come back in a few hours, say, uh, 4:00 a.m.? Fine. I--I look forward to it. Thank you. [CAR DOOR OPENS] - How much further is this? - ERIK: Not far. Yeah. Here. It's right down there. I don't see anything down there. [SCREAMS] That kid is really startin' to tick me off. ERIK: The way I saw it, I could either run with the money and keep running for the rest of my life, or give the money back to Rosewood before he realized he'd been conned. And if I warned him about Tali and the files, maybe he could protect himself and me. - Londyn, I need your car. - Erik. - The keys. Give me your keys. - My God, what happened? Your face! Who did this to you? Where's Cornelius? Erik, where is he? They set us up. Your father, Franklin. We played right into it. Where's Cornelius? They killed him. [SNIFFS] What are you gonna do? ERIK: Mr. Rosewood. Mr. Rosewood, we have to talk. [CRUNCHING] [DOG BARKING] Oh! [SIGHS] What is goin' on? ERIK: You don't understand, Londyn. There's only $67,000. There's supposed to be $2 million. I'm a dead man. I can talk to my father. He'll listen to me. I'll take you home, and then I'll call you from Stripes. You don't have a choice, Erik. You're not gonna find him at Stripes. He's got a meeting in an hour. Where? [SNIFFS] [PHONE RINGING] Londyn! FRANKLIN: You and that briefcase were supposed to be out of town. Franklin. I want you to stay put, Erik. That way no one will get hurt. Oh, what about Rosewood? ERIK: Did you kill him for the disk or for the money? He was a crook. And Tali? I know what happened between you and his wife. You don't know anything. [SCOFFS] What, are you gonna kill him, too? No. I won't have to. FRANKLIN: Rosewood's employer will take care of Tali. Look, Franklin, you've got your money. You've got what you want. Is that what you think this is about? You stay put, Erik. It'll all be over in 30 minutes. What'll be over in 30 minutes? [PHONE BEEPS] Franklin! Franklin! MAN: Come back in a few hours. You'll be late for your meeting. 4:00 a.m. The warehouse. LONDYN: I'll take you home, and then I'll call you from Stripes. ERIK: You're not gonna find him at Stripes. He's got a meeting in an hour. Where? Ah, there you are. Right on time. [DOGS BARKING] Twelve years, Tali. Twelve years. [SCOOTER APPROACHING] Oh, man! ERIK: Where is she? Look who's here. - Where's Londyn? - Where's Londyn? What are you talking about? Is that my money? - Get away from me, Franklin! - I'll get him out of here, Mr. Tali. - We've all gotta get out of here. - Excuse me? This meeting, it's a s... Ugh! Just take him back to Stripes, get the money in the safe and I'll deal with him later. It's a setup! The disk, the shipment, the tape you and I made. - See, I don't have time for this. - That's enough! The men who're comin' tonight, they're comin'... They're comin' to kill you. Isn't that right, Franklin? Oh, like Franklin would have something to do with this. Oh, come on. After everything you've done to him? Humiliated him, controlled him, insulted him? What about what he did with your wife? Oh, you're good, kid. You're very good. You see, I--I could see you pulling off something like that. [CHUCKLING] But Franklin? No. I don't think so. [DOOR OPENING] Get the shipment. But, I already wired your money to the bank in Buenos Aires. I wasn't aware I had an account in Buenos Aires. Excuse me? It's all there. $67,000. 67 thou... It's... Wait, no. I'm sorry. I wired you, uh, $2 million. How much did you steal from me, Mr. Tali? How--How much have I stolen? WOMAN: Mr. Rosewood kept very thorough records. Where did you get that? That's not important. What is important is that you stole from me. Then you killed Mr. Rosewood to cover it up. I didn't kill anyone. TALI: Because there aren't going to be any more payments to Mr. Rosewood. ERIK: But his records. He could send... No, he can't send them if he's dead. I see. Now I have something that belongs to you. [ELEVATOR HUMMING] [SOBBING] She has nothing to do with this! TALI: Whatever it takes. Everything I have. Please. Please! Start with the girl. I wouldn't do that! Yeah, you're right. Rosewood did keep very good records. Your records. Names, dates, places. I would hate to see what would happen if this got into the wrong hands. Or the other copy I made. Other copy? The copy I gave to the FBI. It's useless. The files are encrypted. And I have the password. So this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna walk out this door. We're gonna forget this ever happened. Fine. You win. [GRUNTING] FRANKLIN: Erik! Watch out! [GUNS FIRING] Ah! WOMAN: Remove the wire, Mr. Tali. Remove the wire, Mr. Tali. What about my daughter? The wire. [MUFFLED GRUNTING] Pandora. This isn't over. He faked it. You faked it? [GROANING] You have to pay. For what you did to me. What I did to you? [GUN COCKING] Please. [GUN THUDS] I can't believe... Uh, Franklin... [CRICKETS CHIRPING] CORNELIUS: I've got stuff in here that would just blow your mind. ERIK: Roommate's a piece of work, though. Well, you know, he's probably just nervous. You know, rich kids. TALI: When I first saw you two, I figured you were both strictly small-time. Well, the "how" is not important, Mr. Tali. What is important is how much. That one. MILO: One more round. CAR SALESMAN: How much do you want for this? CORNELIUS: $750. ERIK: Yep, sold my truck. Transfer the funds to El Banco Nacional. $1,842,129. FRANKLIN: The first kid from our hometown ever to crack the Ivy League. ERIK: Freshman. CORNELIUS: How do I know you didn't forge this? Plain paper, no seal, no signature. Why, I can whip one up in no time. TALI: It takes deep pockets to go to Stonebrook. ERIK: More like a bottomless pit. Don't get greedy, Erik. CORNELIUS: You're not seeing the big picture. Everyone's a sucker. ERIK: Not me. [ECHOING] Not me. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Guess I should thank you. Although I knew you wouldn't tell 'em about me. After all, we're partners. Well, you almost got me killed, partner. Well, you were supposed to leave town. That was the plan. Not that it matters. In fact, I'd say everything worked out better than I expected. So how long was that goin' on with you and Franklin? A year? Couple of months? What's that? Your cut. Keep it. There's a lot more where that came from, Erik. I got a guy down in Florida, textile manufacturer, worth millions. I'm not interested. So you'd rather be washin' dishes? Maybe. - Sell that nice car of yours? - I already sold it. Is it the girl, Erik? Is that what it is? You know, I used to think you showed potential. See you around, pal. I doubt it. You got a lot of your old man in you, you know that, kid? FRANKLIN: God, he was a good man. ERIK: A good man once said that to make a mistake is human. To make the same mistake again is character. My father told me that. I didn't understand what he meant until I came to Stonebrook.
