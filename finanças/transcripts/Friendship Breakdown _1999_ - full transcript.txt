What are you talking about? I'm in! Here! It's been a while, you do a lot better. Let me see. Wow, you could be in a national team. If there is a police like you in our country, thieves would become extinct. The kid's show is over. Let see the real one! You're really something. You emptied your magazine and shot one score! Well, if I didn't pretend to fail it, you guys wouldn't have someone to buy a dinner. By the way, what're we gonna eat today? He would pay handsomely. So I'll order lobsters or would it be shark fin soup. Wow! Someone's gone all grey here. What are they selling? Well, they're running for an election. Which party is that. Running for votes all night. Such a nice gesture. Must be popular with those drunk-ass. He seems so humble. He would get so many votes. You guys go ahead, I've got errands to do. What errands? Where are you going? It, you're not ganna treat us dinner, right? Sorry, bro. Bastard! Hands off me! Hey It, you fuck! Hands off me! It's been so long, damn I miss you.

Cut the crap. Just give 1 out of 3 for me. You said it! Don't blame me later. And are you interested in a job that I was asking? My boss has deep pockets. Do what you need. I'm not interested if it's a bad thing. Oh well, Good boy. Bah! Last time you didn't say a word. Or you're saying that because you're comfortable now. Hey! Go go go! Stay down. I said stay down! Hey, stop! Stop! The money is in the car now. Hey, go! You'll take Big to the meeting point. I'll clear this up and I'll be right behind you. First time, huh? Here's your cut. And for Big's, I'll take it! Oh Deow, where are you going? I'm leaving for Chiang Mai, my dad doesn't feel well. Are you leaving now? The doctor said he's in a coma. He's gonna be fine. Please tell everyone not to be worried. I've gotta go now. Deow's dad is over the critical stage. But his shop is going to be confiscated. He has to find money to pay the mortgage. But he has an exam in few days. But he can't let his shop to be confiscated, or his dad would have trouble dealing with it. There would be another chance for the exam. There is no other chance. Cause he need to find money to pay installments endlessly. He expects so much this time. Our restaurant! How much will we gonna get, if we mortgage it? They didn't approve, right? Where did you get that money? That's a lot of money. I just borrowed it. You'll tell Deow that it belongs to you and Nam. If he knows that I had borrowed someone else, he certainly won't keep it. Are you sure? Yes. It'd be better than his shop get confiscated. Or he couldn't take the exam. Thank you so much, both of you. My dad will pay it back as soon as possible. Don't worry about it. That's easy for the rich people like us. It also wanted to see how your dad's doing. But it's weird. He won't come even it is his hometown Excuse me! Sorry about that, don't be sad, buddy. From now on the thieves might be in trouble. Because there is a police like you! Yay! Woo! Ladies and gentlemen, today I feel so glad. Because one of my beloved friends, who always dream of helping defeat this menace And today, He can pass the entrance exam for police officers as expected. Let's give him a big hand. This meal is on the house! Alright, and to celebrate for a police cadet-to-be in a batch of... Right, 51. So today, I would like to dedicate this song to Mr.Deow, by Mr.It! Mr.It would sing this song for us, please welcome him. Some candies? One, two, three... How much money have you got? Some, and you? None! So, no! Just grab two. Hey, let's go. Hold it tight! Hurry! Let's take a photo together. Stay tight! Come on. One, two, three! Thank you, uncle. I'll take it all. Alright, thank you. Good luck. Thank you. I've gotta go now.

Come on, Deow. Thought I couldn't congratulate you. You've been here waiting for me, dad? It's not a waste that the ex-cop help tutoring. You're taking credits for yourself, dad You could ask Deow, then. - Is it true? - Yes. Come on in, go! Thank you so much for guiding me. It's good that Nam chose Police General-to-be over the waiter like you. Yes, it'd be also better than a cook. Hey, don't put the shit on me. When I was young and my mother's still with me, she said that if we let the balloons fly away, aimlessly. It would reach up to the heaven. And it was called Floating Balloon Adulthood... it's all lies. Sometimes, mom would lie to us. When we fell over, walked to her crying, she would blow on my wounds and said Don't cry, son! This candy could help. Even it's just a lie, but sometimes it really could help. Here, something might get better. How's it going? Getting better? Hey, just relax. We choose our own path. So make it lively and bright, just like this flame. It has to be very lively! Like this! Woah! You'll buy more beers, I'll buy some snacks. See you at the restaurant, - we'll getting trashed tonight. - Hey, Noi! Hurry up, It! What's going on here? Noi had been abducted! This is it, right? That's the reason you had to run away. Who's Big? Bang, bang, bang! You're scared shitless now! I'm sick of waiting! When will your damn friend get here? So we can split the money and get out of here. A few more minute and I'd take that fucking money away. How much is it? We should find somewhere else out of sight to park, or other people would see us. You'll get out or I'll shoot! You're scared out of shit! Asshole! You two are gonna trick on me and run away? You're so fucking dead! Bastard, go to hell! If anything happened to him, you would take responsibility for it. We can't call the police, you don't know Big well. If we don't give him money, he would surely kill Noi. And where's the money? I'll go help Noi. Deow! Hey, is my money doing well? Where's my friend? There! Noi! No rush, easy! Let me see money first so I'll be pleased. Step back! Asshole! You dare to play me? Don't you worry about your friend, bastard! Where's my gun? Where is it? You won't let go? We'll see! Deow! Noi! Noi, Noi! It... It It where are you going, It? This all has nothing to do with my friends but they had to be victims. It's all because of you. You betrayed Big! And what the hell do you expect me to do? It just happened! Let's just say I'm sorry. Who cares if you're sorry? One of my friend lost his leg and another one just had brain surgery. Don't know if he could make it. Hey, calm down, It! The one with brain surgery couldn't be helped. But for that one-leg dude, I might have found a way. What can you do about it? I by myself couldn't help anything but my boss could do. He once saved a man to walk free in a murder case easily. My boss has a lots of job orders these days. And I can't handle all those jobs alone. You could help me with few of those jobs. If you can carry through your job, I'm sure my boss could help. It's simple, just dealing with imports and exports service. Hey! Give them money. Give it to them. They're asking for all. You have to give them. Chit and I will manage the car. See you in Phnom Penh. "Where did you put the guns?" "Where did you put the guns?" "No, I don't know" Deow, it's from your friend. It's good to have a friend. Unlike me, I've stayed here like forever and I don't see any single dog pay me a visit. Visiting hours are over. I'm leaving now, son. Uncle, are you alright? I'm sorry to welcome you cruelly. You're safe now. And are all those stuffs safe? He said that please give his regards to Mr.Amnart. Deow... your dad... is dead. How much do you want? It, just tell him. I need you to help my friends. You said that you would help them. Hey, calm down! We can talk. What do you want, just say it. You're one tough die-hard and I love that. I want you to work with me. And your friend who's in jail now, I'll make sure he would walk free in less than a year. Bro, you'll be out next week, right? Yep, I've been waiting for ages. Good luck, bro. Right. Hey, move! Over there! Sorry, I'm sorry. Get out of the way! How dare you! You motherfuckers! You're messing up here! - Stop struggling! - No! There must be a way. No matter what it takes, money or time. Noi is going to be fine. It must be hard on us and we still have to help Deow. That's not a big deal, I have someone who could help us. You have to help It manage the oil stuff. You had been accused of getting involved in illegal oil business. How could you defend yourself? Which oil are you talking about? I only have olive oil. Are you going to the court by yourself? Could you excuse me? There's a lot of new oil field. Shit! If it were ours, we will be fucking rich. Jack, is it yours? I saw it on the boat. Thanks. When did it drop? It would be a mess if I lost one. You're always such a dirty one! It's from Japan. How the hell did they know? You said we're in the clear? Hey, relax! No need to be nervous! I'll get it. Attention! All to the land! A storm is coming. Yes sir! Many is furious with me, some just want to shut me up. There is no other way. My jobs causes a lot of death. Lot of enemies. A simple thing. I can get over it. You may think that I'm fucking bad. No, that's not it. For those I had caused them to death, they're all evil. National evil. By the way, my job is kind of like... social service. Do you believe, when I was younger, I was a police. There're lot of criminals, but they could walk free after taken to the court. Are you gonna get out? Sure I am! Pay me a visit when you get out! Hey, what's wrong? Please, someone help! What's wrong with you? Don't you die on me! Hey, Help! Move over! Oh, what's happened? He's still fine this morning. Fuck it! I said stop the car! "2 years later" Noi! Noi! Thank you so much. I'm honored and grateful that you came here for the grand opening. Don't be too courteous! You're one of us. He's your partner and he took a lot into it. How could I not help? Please come in, come on in! Please come on in! Oh, lots of bags here! This one is for your dad. Alright I got it. You don't have to buy it next time. How do you do? Hello. You don't have to help your boss drinking and dancing on the taxpayer's dime? Dad! I'd better leave now. Goodbye. It! Pass it, Deow! Believe me, one day everyone will understand us. Thinking back to the day we played football here, You and juniors were cheering over there, and three of us were in the field. It was like a dream. A very good dream that I don't ever wanna wake up from. If I didn't come to Bangkok. Our friends wouldn't be like this. I wonder how Deow is doing. And where is he now? If we already knew they're rotten fish, we should cut them out. Do not think of anything. Because that's what the fish seller is. In this photo, we're all in high school in Chiang Mai. We're all look so silly. Do you remember this photo, we were playing fireworks by the river. Think about that! We were celebrating. There were Deow, Nam, Noi and It. That day was the happiest day ever. We were all together. It's almost 3 am. When we finished cleaning up. Be strong. We can't give up. Everything will be better. I'll do anything to make him a full recovery. You don't have to be worried. Take a rest. Relax. When will you get here? The customer has been waiting for so long. How soon? Almost there. One last intersection. This one. Alright. I'll be waiting at the front. Yes, hello. Deow. Come on, quick. Deow come on! If there's nothing wrong happened today, I don't know where to find you. You disappeared without a trace. Do you know how much we worry about you? It's alright if you didn't forgive me, but you shouldn't live your life this way. A junkless who escaped from the jail, you think what I could do? Or I should be a beggar? You're not me, you don't understand how it's going. But you shouldn't earn money this way still. Money? You think I do everything for money? All of fucking bastards that I killed, they deserved it. Scum of the earth. It's better than being a slave who serve for those corrupt one. Deow! If you still keep bothering me, I'll blow your brain out! Noi and I screwed up like this, what else do you want? You think we just wait and do nothing? Deow, do you know why we can't help you that night? Because It give all of his money to help your dad. Your money trades with my leg. From now on I don't owe you anything. Oil were stolen from the warehouse. - If you don't wanna die, - We found a traitor. - then tell me! - But he's just someone unimportant. I just wanna know who he's working for. I didn't do that! I really didn't do that. I don't know anything. I didn't do that! You've gotta believe me. I didn't do that! I'll ask you one last time, who are you working for? It's... I did it alone. I need money. Please forgive me, I won't do it again. I really don't know anything. I really don't know. Please. Don't do that. Wait, bro. I'll tell you. He pushed me, He is... I'm getting sick of the back and forth. I've got your favorite candies. I'll leave that with you. Yes. He broke down the gate and run away. Here, your call. Hello, It! We found him. Watch him! I'll be right there. Bro, we were waiting and finally found him. So we chased him until he skidded off the road They left a truck and ran away. I searched all over the truck. There's no papers of this truck. It, you're overthinking. You knew that I won't betray my friends. I found it on the oil truck. Everybody has it. Don't think about it. If I don't wanna think about it, you have to do it yourself. I'll quit. Here you are. What would you like? Remember, we open this restaurant together. Noi is getting better these days. I think I'll take Nam and Noi to Chiang Mai. If Noi could see his old house and our school, he might remember something. And Nam also could take a rest. I told you he went rogue. And I'm also scared that he might be a spy for the cops. And it could finally lead back to you. Find someone who can shut him up then. I can't do this. I understand. But even if you don't do it, he would have someone else done it for him. Someone like Amnart wouldn't let it go easily. I hire you because I trust you. Make it clean. Jack, get it done. Hey, move all the fish from upper fish tank to the ground one. Alright. Hey, keep the King mackerel in the morning. Press the ice solid. Alright, uncle. Leng got shot! Call an ambulance! Call the police! Quick! Hello. Be careful Noi. Enough. Deow! You took this job from Amnart, right? What's it to you? I'm asking you to cancel this job. Sorry, bud. In 10 minutes, the bomb would go off. Boom! And I'm rich! Easy and well-paid. Who would say no? Hey! A bomb! There's a bomb inside! Hurry! I'll drive! Quick! Come on! Get in! Quick! Go! Nam! Go! Hurry up! Got you! Just go! Go! Go! You take Nam and Noi out! No! You do! I'll cover you guys. I'm a better shot, remember? What about you? Deow! Why did you get back? For someone like me, I will make only one mistake. Oh, please! Why do you have to be two-gunned shootouts like John Woo? Well, I only have two hands. But there are three guns. What am I gonna do, jerk? Shoot! It... Who do you want me to start with? I'm not joking here I'll send your friends to hell first. Ouch! Drop the gun or I'll shoot him! No. It! It! It! It! It! Just stay with me. It! It! People disagree that the judge threw out your case, how do you feel about it? Everyone has the right to doubt but innocent is innocent. But it's a rumour, I can't fix anything about it. Only time will tell. People wil decide. Corruption Thank you. Freeze. This is a police. Drop the gun. Well, Today I'm honored to get in the same car with you. Drop the gun and turn yourself in! This is the police. You are completely surrounded. What do you want? I could give you anything. I have lot of money and I can buy you anything. You can start a new life. Don't come in! Deow!
