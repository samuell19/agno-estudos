(tablet chimes) No, baby, turn the sound off. (Ava imitates heavy footsteps) - Whoa, steady on. (imitates heavy footsteps) Well, um... You know, it's been great, I've been really lucky. I'm really fortunate, actually, because I'm able to fit into dresses from back in my movie star days, such as this one, this one's my favorite. Sort of like an emerald green color. I love this little section, little peekaboo. It's really beautiful. And when you're feeling extra fatty, you can go like this.

And then, she poured out all my alcohol, and I did not like that, not one bit. You know... Not one bit. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.

In the car with thepeople who picked me up, and they were being super chatty, and... I just needed a moment to decompress. - I was worried. - [Thomas] Well, there'sno need to worry. - [Ava] How is it? - [Thomas] Eh, it's the same. Everything's pretty much the same. Pretty sure we had the same fucking room before. - [Ava] What are you gonna do, tonight? - [Thomas] I think I'm just gonna go to sleep soon. - Okay. I've been doing some reorganizing today, so, um...

(pills rattle) - What are you doing? - I'm uh... I'm throwing out these pills here, that your Momma used to take. - Are you sick? - Um... No, not anymore. But my mind was a bit sick. - Hm? - Um... My uh, my imagination would kind of run off withthe fairies, sometimes. And um... I would... I would see things that weren't necessarily real. - Like ghosts? - Do you know what spririt is? - Yeah. It's who you are inside. - Yeah. That's right. And... I stopped knowing who I was inside. And I just stayed all one mood. I couldn't really feel much of anything. And then you feel like you need these things, and people convinceyou that you need them. And they tell you that you're sick and then you believe it. And the next thing youknow you're 60 years old and you've been taking them your whole life, and you don't really know who you are without them, anymore. So... That is why, it's good that I'm throwing them out. - I'm sorry thathappened to you, Momma. (tea kettle whistles) - Is Ava gonna start acting, again? - Well, you know, I don't think so. She's uh... - [Rosario] Really? - [Thomas] Yeah, she's... - God, man, I think about her sometimes. - [Thomas] Yeah, she's just not into it, anymore.

And as a child my survival technique was to have this warrior spirit. And now, as an adult, it completely doesn't serve me, because I just use that to just barrel through life. And I just feel, oh, God, I feel like I'm just sucking at life. - [Penny] You're safe. Safe. Let it go, baby, it's okay. - Oh, God. I just think that... I have a coping mechanism for feeling like this, but I don't really feel anything. I have these fleetingmoments like right now, where it hits me like afucking ton of bricks. And then when that usually happens I get so fucking panicky. I panic and I can't breathe, and then I see things that are probably not even there. And I feel like... What was once there... For now... It's kinda fucking me over, 'cause um... 'Cause... It stops me fromactually feeling things, and I really crave and believe in real. And I haven't felt realin a really long time. - And it's all okay. It's all good. You gotta let the thinking go, and allow the feeling to happen, you see? Breathe, take some breath in. Way down deep in your belly. - God. - It's okay, it's okay if you feel. Let it out, whatever it is. Let it out! (Ava and Penny laugh) Let it out! - [Ava] Okay. (Penny laughs joyously) That's my girl.(laughter fades) - [Thomas] Hey. - Oh, Thomas, thank God. Can I get you a coffee? - I'm sorry I'm late. A bottle of water would be great. - [Naja] Okay. (footsteps recede) (moody music) (footsteps return) - Thank you. - Big night? - Yeah. Hey, where's the bathroom? - Uh, through there. - Thank you. Just be a minute. (liquid splatters) (bristles scrub harshly) - Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up! Wake up. - I'm up. - [Ava] What is wrong with you? - [Thomas] I'm sick. Fucking Christ, I'm up. What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. I'm up. (water runs) - Hello. - [Thomas] Hey. - Come on in. - [Thomas] Thank you. Yeah, well I've... Been experiencing some really intense lower back pain. - Oh, no, I'm sorry. What's your name, again? - Thomas. - Thomas, you don'thave to do that in here. You just tell me what you like. - I've actually been having back pain. - Vicodin? Percocet? Somas? Oxys? I can give you Somas with a Vicodin, or a Percocet, if you want. - Yeah, that sounds good. - [Doctor] Which? - Boom, boom, boom, boom. (music with pounding beat) Sexier, sexier. Mmhmm, sexier. That's it. What's it look like, Marcy? Let's reset these fucking cases. (laughs) These suitcases, reset. All right, that's perfect. That's real. That's magic, let's do this. - You want me to take it out? - [Thomas] No, let's keep 'em. Now, Svetlana, why don't you just, show me how much you love that suitcase, and uh... Loretta, show me how much you love yourself, somehow, and we're gonna shoot. Okay? This is called reality. Okay, love it. That's beautiful. You are a fucking peach.

(Ava laughs) - [Penny] Is that shocking? - [Ava] No. Who did you find it easier to fall in love with? Men, or, or women? - [Penny] Falling in love is pretty easy. Being in love is a little more difficult. (both laugh)- [Ava] Staying in love. Is really hard.- [Penny] Mmhmm. - [Ava] Yeah. Do you get lonely up here? - [Penny] No, a lot of time alone, but rarely lonely. I have a lot of friends. I meet wonderful strangers. (both laugh) - [Ava] Yeah. - [Ava] It's funny, I'm never by myself. Always surrounded by people. Yet I always feel alone. - [Penny] Oh, that's the worst. - [Ava] Yeah. - [Penny] Alone in a crowd, ooh. - [Ava] Yeah.- [Penny] Yeah. - [Ava] I don't talk to him, anymore. And I feel ashamed because, I feel so disconnected from him that I feel so disconnected from my baby. - [Penny] It's a goodthing you're telling me. It's a really good thing. - You're pretty special. I didn't know life could feel like this. - [Penny] You make it what it is. Hm? - Yeah. I have not felt this happy in like, a really long time. Yeah. I just... I love... I love feeling close to you like this. And like... And listening to you. I mean, everything that you say, every... Every thing that comes out of your mouth, is so beautiful and poignant and... It's like... You're the clearest person that I know. You've breathed life back into me. - It ain't me, babe. No. Hm? It's not him. It's not even her. It's you. Tell yourself the truth. You tell everyone youknow and love the truth. Okay? (cell phone rings) - [Ava] Hello? - Hey. - Wow. Hope you're proud of yourself. What'd you do? - Doesn't matter. - It does, actually, because you will not be getting in the car until I know what my husband's done. - Your husband got cut off by some fucking asshole, so I rear-ended him and I punched him in the face. - Ah. You're a tough cookie, my man. - Where were you? - Oh, look at you, road rage! So what, you felt likejust getting in your car and be like, "Oh, hey,I'm gonna get in my car "and I'm gonna drive around, I'm gonna find someone, "gonna be a big old badass, and I'm gonna run into him, "then I'm gonna be like, 'Oh, my God!' "Hey, watch out, here I come!" - Fuck! - Oh, did baby have a tantrum? Is that what that was? Was it? 'Cause I couldn't quiteunderstand what you were saying, 'cause it was kinda like-- - I asked where my fucking wife was. - How's that feel, huh? Does it feel good to put your hands on me? Make you feel like a manto put your hands on me? - Are you high? You're fucking high, aren't you? - Whatever. (laughs) Oh, fuck. (cries) - Come on, are you crying, now? You know, I needed you, today. - Of course you did! 'Cause it's your crisis,your job, your schedule. Never about me! - Yeah, so I can pay for the house, the school, everything. - You are so transparent. You and all your fashiony shit. And all your chichi models. Your lame-ass parties you go to. You think I don't know what goes on? What, you think I'm a dumbass? - Yeah. You're so evolved, right? - Fuck you! Ha! Look at you. Everyone knows it. What, you couldn't handle the fact that there was aspotlight on your girl? 'Cause she was a movie star and you what? Took some photos with your camera? Hey, I'd be threatened about that, too. But guess what? Lucky for you, I gotknocked up, and so now, I get to serve the purpose of her husband's existence! - Yeah, what the fuck do you serve? Serve what? - This is fucking ugly. Where do we go? - You got the keys?'Cause I'm gonna drive. (keys jingle) (door squeaks) - I miss you even when you leave for just two minutes. What do two people do who love each other so much? - Well... They just die. (door squeaks open) - Hey. - [Thomas] Hey. - That's happening now again, is it? - No. That was the last one. - [Ava] Please don't lie to me. - I'm not lying, I'm serious. That was the last one. - Don't lie to me. Ow. - Sorry, I smelllike cigarettes. So, so sorry. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - [Thomas] Just giving you a little loving. - Babe...

(imitates Scottish accent) 'Ello Stuart from Scotland! - You look amazing, wow. (Ava and Stuart exclaim) - Good night, see you guys. Have a good night. Right. Let the fun begin. (Lily laughs) What are we doing? - Not going to bed. - What? - I mean, I could've had sex like, probably three times. You know how many timesI had sex this week? - How many? - [Woman dressed as present] Zero times. - That's not enough times. - It's not enough times. (Ava laughs) - Yes! They're online dating.

We went out, a club, we were just partying, and... We did some coke, and then... I don't remember the rest. - Bullshit. Tell me. (Ava sobs) Oh, my God. Did you fool around with those girls? - Yes. - [Ava] Yeah. - Yeah, there was a little bit of that, I know, but it wasn't what you think. I was just... We were all fucked up, and I was wasted, and we were just kissing each other and the guy was kissing me, and I was kissing the girls, and then I was taking fucking pictures, and then he just fucking, he just fucking did it. - Fuck. I... I don't know what to think. - I know. - How did you... You did... You fucking did this to our family. We have a child. I am so ashamed of you. I hate you. But you're my husband.

(Lily growls) (Ava laughs) - [Thomas] Whoa! - [Ava] Wow, what a big, bad, scary wolf. - Wolves don't talk to humans! - Right, it's just... - Right, wolves don't talk to humans. - Method, method, you're method, you're method acting. Hey, um, I'm gonna talk to Mommy outside for a second. Then you can take a walk outside with me. It's been awhile, huh? - Yeah, looks like it. It's like, just collecting dust. - You could get it working, again. - [Ava] Yeah. I have something I wanna tell you. - [Thomas] Okay. - I have... I haven't been feeling very well. But I feel clearer now. And um... And I feel good. - [Thomas] Okay, that's good. - I just... I thought it was really important to tell you that. - Yeah. That's okay. - I'm sorry we don't talk about it. - [Thomas] That's okay. How can we talk about it, when I don't talk? We don't talk. We don't talk, anymore. - [Ava] Oh, there's another thing. - All right. - We're pregnant. - What? That's amazing. You are? - [Ava] Yeah.
