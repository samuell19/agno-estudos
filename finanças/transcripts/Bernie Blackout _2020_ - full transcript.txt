But the race has already been in motion for more than a year. The Democratic field has narrowed from 21 to 11 candidates, and Bernie is in a tie with four other nominees. And that's no small feat. Since he recovered from a heart attack in the fall, the mainstream media has been attempting to write Sanders' political obituary. -So this is a major development in the race. How will it effect who becomes the democratic nominee? -He had a heart attack. -Yeah, well, that's -- -He had a heart attack in the fall. Do you think the American people deserve to know more? -But some would argue that mainstream media has been unfairly dismissing Bernie Sanders since his last presidential campaign in 2016. -Some are sounding the alarm. The headline of Jonathan Chait's piece in New York Magazine reads "Running Bernie Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity". Over at the Atlantic, "Bernie Can't Win." -After the heart attack, there was a lot of talk that Bernie Sanders was done. It's over. The campaign's finished. -David Sirota is senior adviser and head speech writer for Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign. He has a pivotal roll in creating the campaign strategy for fighting the media blackout. -Progressive campaigns need to be run as professionally and as ruthlessly as the campaigns that are run by the other side. Well, the Bernie blackout was a term that came up that described how the media weren't really covering the campaign. I think the term also became a catch-all term for the media's specific kind of coverage. But I also want to be very clear. That doesn't mean I think that there wasn't good reporting, good journalism on the campaign trail. What we're really talking about here is in many cases, cable news and the pundit shows. -And he looks like the angry man in the center of the stage saying, "Get off my lawn." -I think he comes off as mean. I think he's disparaging. -Cable news there was a lo-- there was certainly examples of just open hostility. -Bernie, you're full of it.

What the American people in this country need, they need somebody that is unabashed and that has the courage and the conviction to stand up for them and to call out the rigging of this system. And that candidate is Senator Bernie Sanders. People are really excited and there are so many people coming into Iowa from all parts of the country to really support Senator Sanders. The weather may be chilly, but the hearts of the people here in Iowa are very warm. And they are feeling the burn. -The Iowa caucus, the first official contest in the election season. Historically, victories in Iowa lead to momentum that becomes essential to win other states.

This is my second weekend coming to Iowa to come knock on doors for Bernie. -We just got a whole fleet here. I've heard there's over 1,700 out-of-state volunteers in Iowa now at this point the weekend before the caucus. -The campaign works its way through Iowa, making small stops along the way to a large rally in Cedar Rapids. -This platform, it became something super important for me that I feel like I just have to be a part of it. -The reason I believe we win is not because of our TV ads.

Bernie became involved in segregation and anti-Vietnam protests. -I mean, you know, there's pictures of him out there in the 1960s being arrested, chained to an African-American, you know, because they were protesting racial injustice in Chicago. -He won his first election as an independent by an upset of just ten votes, beating the Republicans and the Democrats. -The Office of Mayor of the City of Burlington... -The Office of Mayor of the City of Burlington... -He served four terms as mayor of Burlington, Vermont. -Fighting for economic democracy for the rights of all people is an idea that is as American as apple pie. -I was a community organizer when I met Bernie, and he spoke, and I thought he embodied everything I ever believed in. -In 1988, he married Jane. As mayor he took a grass roots approach to media, creating his own talk show and speaking directly with the people of Burlington. -Ordinary citizens feel very hopeless about the future. In Burlington, we have shown that you can stand up to the system and at least you're going to win some of the victories. -He went on to serve eight terms in the US House and was elected to the Senate in 2006. -35 years after my original impression of him, he still embodies everything that I ever believed in. -I don't know anybody in my life who has had such, you know, strong views as a young person and been consistent to them their entire lives. -I think that I've never, in my 31 years of running campaigns, ever seen the grass roots support show up for a campaign that I've seen in this campaign. ♪♪ -I've been doing this work for 31 years, so I've got long tentacles into the political operative world and folks on the ground. And the unique thing about Bernie and the way he's not normally covered on broadcast TV is making sure that there's ways to reach the electorate. One of the main ways that I do that is through alternative media, like The Hill "Rising" with Krystal Ball and that crew where I'm a regular on their show. Because there's groups of people out there that want to take in information that's not skewed through the corporate media lens. -All across America, independent journalists and media creators have been reporting outside of the mainstream media. -It's not clear how much they are even aware of their bias. -We have to be building a movement that is bigger than just Bernie Sanders himself. -Without network air time, they use their own resources to call out the hypocrisy in America's corporate press. -When I was at MSNBC, I saw what many people saw early on before the primary had even started on the Democratic side that Hillary Clinton would be a bad candidate. So though I admire and respect Secretary Clinton deeply, I must say don't run, Hillary, don't run. But afterwards, the Clinton people called and complained to the MSNBC top brass and threatened not to provide any access during the upcoming campaign. I was called in by my boss who said, "That was fine, but anything else that you do on Hillary Clinton needs to be submitted to the president of the network." Now, being a human interested in maintaining my job, I'm certain I did less critical Clinton commentary after that than I maybe otherwise would have. -Mainstream media has a boss. Their boss is not a working-class person. The mainstream media isn't owned by the people. It's owned by rich people, and reach people tell them what to say. -The corporate media is there to further the agenda of the establishment, of the oligarchs, because they own it. -Democracy has been stolen from us. It's been hijacked by the very, very wealthy and it's being held ransom. -In 1982, 90% of media was controlled by 50 companies. Today the media landscape has changed. AT&T, Comcast, Walt Disney and Viacom together account for $386 billion in total revenue. Now, only five corporations own about 90% of the media landscape. -The daily agenda at any network is driven by its leader. -Ultimately, they're serving a customer base, and the advertisers from which they get their money are also serving a customer base. -Greatest responsibility is to serve our... -Treasure Valley communities... -The El Paso-Las Cruces communities... -In 2018, a viral video was released showing Sinclair Broadcast Group directing its anchors to all fall in line with the same message. -The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media... -It was a shocking example to many people that networks have an agenda, and that agenda comes from the top leadership. -...and this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. -You'd be more informed just by sitting on the couch and drinking a bottle of gin. -A lot of journalists depend for their career on access to the establishment. And a lot of the pundits, which are routinely on cable news and routinely called upon for quotes in mainstream publication articles, depend on that establishment for their own livelihoods. -The demographics of who watches network television and who watches cable television like MSNBC and CNN, it's most older people. -Independent media has done so much to help Bernie Sanders fight back, and they've also had this partnership with young people in America. -The revolution will not be televised. Most people know that phrase. So what does that mean?

This afternoon though, Bernie Sanders declared victory in Iowa based on the raw votes. -Mayor Pete's been declaring a win for days now. Why should people believe your victory speech over his? -Because I got 6,000 more votes. And from where I come, when you get 6,000 more votes that's generally regarded to be the winner. Yes. -Iowa was a mess. And that unfortunately meant that we didn't get the boost out of winning the most votes in Iowa that would have helped build more momentum. -The data, it wasn't -- there was no revolution in terms of turn out. The numbers went down. -The numbers went up with young people and with people of color. That's a great indicator working into -- going into states that are a lot more diverse. Sure, more regular white working class people did not vote. But more people of color went and voted for Bernie Sanders. I know that's kind of hard to hear for a lot of people out there who don't like Bernie Sanders, but that's just the fact. -After the messy, unclear results from Iowa, attentions turned to the next major competition -- New Hampshire. Despite Bernie's lead, the media finds a way to frame it negatively. Chuck Todd and others framed the narrative that Bernie is polling well below his numbers in 2016 when he beat Clinton by 20 percent. It's a debatable perspective because this primary has many more candidates than in 2016. Expectations for such a decisive victory for any of them is absurd. -Despite having any results in Iowa, the candidates are turning their sights to the Granite State for a crucial final push for votes. -The Iowa caucus system had some inherent flaws.

In 2016, the media mostly tried to ignore him. -January 1, 2015, I think through November 2015, "ABC Evening News" had us on for 20 seconds. -What was it you did that was so newsworthy? -[ Laughs ] -They showed more of the open podium waiting for Donald Trump than ever playing your speeches. -This is a huge crowd.

Just didn't mention who won. -It's the same progression that the establishment greets many social movements. First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they attack you. -Bernie Sanders makes my skin crawl. -He wants free tuition for colleges. A great idea if you think money grows on bongs. -Senator Sanders is not electable. -The media has a laundry list of reasons why Bernie cannot be president. Mainstream media has constantly shifted its reasons. Electability. -There's this narrative that Bernie Sanders is not electable against Donald Trump, which is amazing. And it's amazing how strong that is, how much it's stuck given that the data just doesn't prove that. -It's not just that Bernie is asking a lot of voters to buy into what I consider radical ideas like, free public college, the Green New Deal, medicare for all. -The media spins health care as Bernie Sanders has an utterly infeasible, pie-in-the-sky plan. -Some might say you are way too far left. -Bernie is a socialist. Bernie is a communist. -This dope once adored the Sandinistas, a toxic bunch of commies. Sanders is so nutty, most kids should be allergic to him. -How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States? -Then you have the idea that Bernie can't win because he's a socialist. I mean, the truth is, yes, he's a democratic socialist. He has such a consistency and honesty that even people who don't even like the idea of socialism, they find him trustworthy and compelling. -Even as Sanders did better and better in the polls, even as he was drawing crowds like a rock star at different rallies, there's always sort of a new counter-narrative that was meant to sort of take him down a notch. -The contempt is so strong and so open and so unchecked and so rampant, and there's no accountability. -I think your disheveled, your unlikable and you're pushy. -Any possible narrative that they can create in order to discredit him they will push, push, push, push. And it works. -The media's specific kind of coverage when they covered Bernie Sanders was, in many cases, coverage that didn't take him seriously and was always kind of sneering and scoffing at him. -This is a movement that we have created since 2015 when the senator ran the first time around. The senator is the total antithesis of President Trump. So, he is the one to galvanize a multicultural, multiracial, multi-gender campaign of people from all walks of life who are really here to stand up against the system and to stand up for what is good, what is right and what is just. -You know, at a Bernie rally there's an excitement, an energy of urgency, an energy of what is possible. -I was a Kent State when the kids were felled. And as a grown up boomer, it's very disenchanting to think that we can't do better. And I know Bernie can. I want the DNC. I want Democrats to get behind him, and I hope that happens. -Bernie Sanders has irrevocably changed the terrain and the conversation of this country. We are going to show this country and the world what New Hampshire can do and what the United States of America can do. -Sanders' rallies have this electric energy to them, and they really make tangible the possibility that a radically different world is possible. -Give some Bernie 2020 love to national campaign surrogate, Dr. Cornel West.

[ Bus horn honks ] -Mainstream media seizes the opportunity to raise questions about Sanders' campaign. -So the story of the Sanders' campaign so far this year is how much ground he's lost from four years ago. -Sanders won this state handily back in 2016 with 60 percent, and it is notable that he's on nowhere near that level of support this time around. -That's the lowest win that you've ever seen in New Hampshire. -Don't get your hopes up on Bernie yet. -All this, but no one will focus on the fact that Bernie Sanders just won the popular vote in the first two states. No candidate has ever won the first two states by popular vote and not been the nominee. The media downplays the success by pointing out that Iowa and New Hampshire do not really represent America and its diversity. Bernie's supporters are not diverse enough. Viewers of mainstream media constantly hear about the Bernie Bro and the idea that a significant portion of his supporters are angry white men. -Around January, February of 2016 we saw kind of a flurry of Bernie Bro articles. It's really -- it's anecdotal evidence presented as statistical proof. -The Bernie Bro -- an insufferable, aggressive, self-righteous, left wing activist who refers to everyone who doesn't share his narrow political views as a corporate, puppet/media whore. -You may have heard the term "Bernie Bro" this election season. Typically young, white and male. -The Bernie Bro, right? Somebody who's a bit younger, whiter. -It is so insulting for the media to consistently, you know, put out this narrative that all Bernie supporters are these white, racist, sexist men who are saying horrible things to people. -And the Bernie Bros again, they're pretty obnoxious and they're very sexist. -The most violent, most misogynistic, the most sexist, the most harmful. -People are mean on Twitter sometimes. This is not an exclusive phenomenon to Bernie Sanders. Nor is it a particularly important topic of debate. -If you go online, most likely you're not going to get into squabbles with people on your side. -If you are still supporting Sander as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism. -"I can't vote for him because some of his supporters are rude to me online." Like, just hearing that -- just hearing that... -It's ridiculous. -...it's ridiculous. -This whole notion of a Bernie Bro is the most blatant, pathetic attempt to try to turn possibly undecided voters off from actually looking into Bernie as their candidate. -Part of the Bernie Bro narrative that's so frustrating is that Sanders is responsible for any and all and every person online. They are somehow extensions of Sanders. -If you say somebody is allowing something, by default you are saying that they can do something about it. -And he can't. -And he can't. ♪♪ -Not too long ago, I came out as Bernie Bro just as my attempt to kind of dispel the notion that all of Bernie's supporters look a certain way and that it's a very weird, cult-ish following. -We have seen that Bernie actually has had the most diverse coalition. -There is no hard data to support the Bernie Bro myth. So I decided to look for the data and examine it myself. There is as many Bernie supporters online as there are all other candidates combined. I downloaded over one hundred million tweets from all the followers of major candidates and analyzed them for their negativity. The data did show that two percent of Bernie's supporters' tweets were quite negative. But the thing is the same percentage was true for all the candidates' supporters. There's a phenomena called frequency illusion. If someone points something out to you, you're going to notice it more. And so because the media points out the nasty two percent of Bernie's supporters, people notice that and not the nastiness of any other candidates' supporters. And that's how the Bernie Bro myth grows. -Rather than dealing with the substance, you can cherry pick some nasty comment on Twitter and use that as a way to dismiss everything that goes along with Bernie Sanders and his movement. -The Republic strategist Karl Rove used to say that you shouldn't hit your opponent where your opponent is weakest. You should actually hit them where they're strongest. I think it's inarguable that Bernie's greatest strength is actually his supporters. Dedication becomes fanaticism. Passion becomes anger. And that's where you started to get all of these stories about how Bernie Sanders' supporters were uniquely toxic, uniquely terrible. That they were responsible for behavior that was tantamount to abuse, and that Bernie Sanders needed to disavow them. Over and over again, this line of attack was used. And I think it's very clear that, in fact, this was the Karl Rove strategy in action. Transform somebody's greatest strength into their biggest weakness. -Bernie travels to Bakersfield, California where almost half the population is Latino. He's greeted with an overflow rally that mainstream media fails to cover or mention. -The Senator Sanders campaign coming to Bakersfield and having a rally, talking to us directly about the issues is fantastic. -I just like what he stands up for. -You know, the country's been in need of changes and I want a different future for my little girls. -I have friends that are LGBTQ. They don't even know that he's a big supporter of them. He's been doing that since before a lot of us were even born, and he's still doing it now. -When he talks, he talks from his heart.

And then a new problem for the campaign. Just days before the Nevada caucus, culinary union leaders circulate a health care score card to their members stating that Bernie's platform would end union health care. The message fails to mention that under Sanders' universal health care plan they would have the same or better coverage. -The state's most influential union says a vote for Sanders is a vote to end health care as they know it. -How would you answer that union member who says, "We fought for five years to get this health plan. It's a great gold-plated health plan. Why should we give it up for nationalized health care?" -You're the one who is at war with the culinary union right here in Las Vegas. We can solve these issues. -We have more union support than you have ever dreamed of. ♪♪ -It's the Nevada caucus, another crucial early state. With Nevada's large Latino population, this is Bernie's first chance to prove that he's capable of drawing a diverse coalition. -There are so many unknowns when I look at Nevada. To begin with, the polling is infamously off given the nature of the population. -Nevada's culinary union has been such an influential voice in Nevada politics. -Very important to keep our own health care because we have the best health care in Nevada. -Conflict around the Nevada Culinary Union has flared up in the media. -So, when Culinary 226 did come out and criticize Bernie Sanders for Medicare For All, his supporters really attacked them. -A reckless minority of Bernie supporters make threats to the union leaders online sparking a massive debate on the hostility of Bernie Bros. -One of the big narratives in the race was Bernie's campaign and his supporters are just too mean. -Then the vicious attacks that the union senate received. -They're going to go after him about the bad behavior of Bernie's supporters or not. Is this how they do things in Denmark? -And I think Bernie has a lot of questions to answer here. -If you looked at much of the news coverage, much of the news coverage was telling you that the real thing people should be worried about is the appropriateness of the tone of some Bernie Sanders supporters. It's an example of a completely manufactured narrative. It's not to excuse, you know, this or that terrible tweet or this or that, you know, terrible social media posting. It's only to say that it's the rough and tumble of a campaign and when you are exclusively trying to scandalize one campaign's situation and you're illustrating an actual attitude and bias that is not fair and is not objective. -The Bernie Bro narrative dominates coverage. Can Sanders' campaign overcome this latest attempt to derail his momentum? With voting underway in Nevada, Bernie heads to Texas, a state which months ago had him polling in single digits. Bernie decides to rally and watch the Nevada results in a heavily Latino populated San Antonio. -You're going to be going inside. It's moving, it's moving, it's moving. Let's go. -Mainstream media is saying we can't get things done. Saying that it's all too extreme when our positions are moderate. Our positions are not extreme, they're just painted as extreme to really prevent them from happening. -What he says is what we all should be doing, is caring about people and not the bottom dollar. His affinity to the working class has perked my interest. I'm a union member. I have been for 20 years. You know, unions have things that they negotiate. They negotiate wages, they negotiate the working conditions, they negotiate pension, they negotiate health care. Take health care off the table. -Senator Sanders says he wants to improve health care benefits for unions but this union is specifically saying they want to keep their private health insurance, and we're hearing that from unions across the country. -There's one thing that makes the establishment media, establishment Democrats or Republicans really nervous, and that's every time Bernie Sanders starts doing really well. Because the more better he does, the more everybody worries about them not being relevant because they're falling in line with everybody else. Whether it's the corporate media or whether it's the establishment. -There is real concern right now that Bernie Sanders is so far ahead in the lead here in Nevada, and then might go to South Carolina further fracture that Joe Biden support among African-Americans, sweep up a ton of delegates in California, currently where he's leading by a large margin in the polls, and then become essentially unstoppable. ♪♪ -We are at the Bernie Sanders rally waiting for him to come on and I'm really excited because it is a caucus night, so we get to see the results coming in while we're here and hopefully we'll get to celebrate a win with Mr. Bernard Sanders tonight.

He's going to be a president--" "I don't care! You're not covering this." We were told that we had to cover something down in Texas that was totally meaningless. -That's the history of MSNBC and their journalism.

[ Cheers and applause ] -While the Austin rally is in full swing, cable news pays little attention. Instead, they circle their talking points around a "60 Minutes" promo clip of an interview with Senator Sanders that will air later that night. The clip features Bernie Sanders expressing that not everything Fidel Castro did was bad. In an interview from 1985, he cites Castro's literacy program. -He educated the kids, gave them health care. Totally transformed the society. -New outlets shift to a different narrative -- Sanders is not electable because of his complimentary views of Castro's literacy program. -There was a couple of dynamics at play. I mean, there was an effort to blow up anything Bernie said that was controversial into an enormous controversy. I mean Bernie got asked one question about Fidel Castro. It became a three day, four day news story. -Shouldn't we judge dictators by the violation of human rights and not by any of their alleged achievements? -If you only tuned into the news you might think that Bernie Sanders was campaigning for Fidel Castro. I mean, he was literally on "60 Minutes," and he was asked a question about it. Answered a question in a very similar way, by the way, that Barack Obama answered the question and it was like some huge controversy. -There is a saying here in South Florida by many Cubans that they say, you know, Castro may have given us health care and education but he didn't give us breakfast, lunch or dinner. -They're attacking your comment as absolutely unacceptable, singing the praises of a murderous tyrant. -It's the 10th Democratic debate, four days before the South Carolina primary. The latest narrative frames Sanders as a radical, communist sympathizer, someone far from the party's current core message and comfort zone. Bernie's contentious relationship with the DNC is not new. -There's been a war in the Democratic party. And the donor class are on one side, and the progressives and the base are on the other side. -In 2016, the moderate side was heavily favored when Hillary Clinton received nearly all the super delegate support before primary voting had even begun. -Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don't have to be in a position where they are running against grass roots activists. And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn't competition between them. -I'm not sure that that answer would satisfy an anxious, young voter. -CNN hosted a town hall featuring Hillary Clinton, and then CNN contributor, now DNC interim chair, Donna Brazile, actually gave the Clinton campaign an advanced notice of a question that they were going to ask. -And that is obviously biasing the debate because Bernie Sanders didn't have any questions in advance. -Democratic National Committee is very happy with corporate journalists running Democratic debates. -Our latest NBC News Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday two thirds of all voters said they were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for president. What do you say to those voters, sir? -What was the result of that poll? Who was winning? -The question is to you. -Well, the question was that I was winning and I think by a fairly comfortable margin. Might mention that. -The corporate wing of the Democratic party, the establishment wing is represented by one pundit after another. The progressive wing almost never gets to speak. What many in the Democratic party establishment fear is not that Bernie couldn't beat Trump. It's that Bernie would beat Trump, transform the Democratic party, and transform the country. -With Bernie leading in the polls, Chris Matthews encourages the other candidates to attack the front runner.

Good or bad, which way it will go, we don't know. Does it feel like that to you? -Yeah, and I hope that the candidates who have been telegraphing their punches against Sanders, Senator Sanders, are actually going to deliver them. -Can Americans trust that a Democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass? -And that's why Russia is helping you get elected so you'll lose for him. -Oh, Mr. Bloomberg. -Imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. -What began as a blackout and then, you know, first they ignored him, then they laughed at him, then they attacked him. And the attacks really accelerated when it became clear Bernie could be the nominee. -You can't do it. You cannot talk about Fidel Castro's literacy program. You just can't. Not in American politics. And you shouldn't be able to. That ain't cool not just with former Republicans. That ain't cool with South Carolina voters. That ain't cool with Democrats. -The race turns to South Carolina. Mainstream media argues that the candidate who takes South Carolina will be in the driver seat to win the nomination -- a new state and a new media narrative. -These southern states that are considered locked up for Biden in terms of the black vote. -Nobody was questioning the fact that Joe Biden had lied on numerous occasions about being involved in a civil rights movement as a front line organizer, which he was not, and also about engaging in civil disobedience against Nelson Mandela's imprisonment in a apartheid South Africa. Those were two blatant lies that Joe Biden perpetrated. And yet he was never asked, not in the debates or any interviews, by pundits about these lies. -If he can lie to black people about getting arrested, going to see... -Nelson Mandela. -...or trying to see Nelson Mandela. If he can lie time and time again over the years and people not completely oust this guy and disqualify him, and they instead say, "Yeah, he's our candidate, he's our guy. Uncle Joe, we believe in him." If that happens, then right now we're living in a reality where the facts are not the priority. -NBC News is now projecting that former vice president Joe Biden has won a decisive victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary. -Heading into a state like South Carolina, you know, the odds were stacked against us. Biden basically in many ways got a pass on his record. Bernie would periodically bring up past votes that Biden had taken. He said he didn't write the bankruptcy bill that was literally his bankruptcy bill. At one point he sort of said that he had always been against the Iraq war. At another point he just denied that he ever pushed to cut social security. I mean, these are just blatant lies. I mean, they're just verifiable, demonstrable lies that really were not fact checked at all. You could criticize our campaign for not more intensely and repeatedly pushing that message. But there's also a media culpability here, which part of the job of the media is to actually legitimately fact check these things. There are objective facts and truth, and in a lot of ways the media did not do its job to actually make sure that the conversation that was happening on the campaign trail was rooted in fact. I mean, there is a referee role that the media just refused to play. The media couldn't bring itself to simply state a fact. -South Carolina is when we saw the big shift in the media narrative. We saw it shift from a very likely Sanders presidency to it's all over. Biden has captured the popular imagination and spirit of the American voter. He has crushed it. ♪♪ -48 hours before Super Tuesday, Sanders' campaign commits to an aggressive rally schedule throughout California. -We're going to see here that Bernie has the power to win this election, and it will be undeniable. -There's a political revolution happening in the streets.

They're very upset that somebody is making $10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a pay check for four months more than they received last week. Oh, my God! The universe is collapsing. -The coronavirus crisis and the economic crisis that it has caused has led a lot of people to start demanding the emergency implementation of Bernie Sanders's platform. -Every inch of Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn now inundated with those suffering from COVID-19. -As the pandemic rages on, a new story completely ignored by all major news outlets is revealed by independent journalists. -So why don't you tell us what happened? -We were alone, and it was the strangest thing. There was no, like, exchange really. His hands were on me and underneath my clothes. -The coronavirus pandemic has all but shut the 2020 Democratic primaries down. With near constant media attention on the virus, there's one new election story the mainstream media refuses to tell. Independent journalist Katie Halper breaks the story on her weekly podcast. She interviews a former staffer for Biden in the early '90s. The victim alleges sexual assault. -And then he went -- he went down my skirt, but then up inside it. -I wanted someone who doesn't have such a record as a Sanders supporter to tell the story because I thought it would -- I wanted to make sure people didn't think I was politicizing it or, you know, that this wasn't a totally honest story, which it is. -I looked up to him. He was like my father's age. He was this champion of women's rights in my eyes. I have no platform. I am no one. -I believe her. I spoke to her brother and her friend, both of whom remember her telling about the incident at the time. But no one else would tell her story. -Tara Reid had a very hard time getting her story told, vetted, shared at all. You see, there's a powerful club here in this town, and you're not in it, and neither is Tara. I thought Tara deserved a full vetting and a fair hearing from a mainstream outlet. But as I reached out to mainstream folks that I know to see if they were interested in breaking this bombshell story, I heard back crickets. Nothing. No one seemed to want to touch it. And you can bet that if the shoe were on the other foot and you had a similarly credible accuser of Bernie Sanders, there's no doubt that she would have no trouble whatsoever getting tons of coverage. So it's an incredibly powerful example of the way that this ideological bias works to help the anointed candidate, Joe Biden. And you just see this glaring hypocrisy from people who would use the hashtag "believe women," who would use the hashtag "me too." And yet with Tara Reid, they find every excuse in the book to try to not take her allegations seriously. -Instead of immediately reporting Tara Reid's story, pundits continued to turn out anti-Sanders reporting. Mainstream media outlets delayed covering Tara Reid's story until much later, causing the allegation to have no real impact on the primary race. ♪♪ Weeks pass by with continual pressure on Bernie to leave the race. -Last I heard, people in a democracy have a right to vote. And they have the right to vote for the agenda that they think can work for America, especially in this very, very difficult moment. We are assessing our campaign as a matter of fact, where we want to go forward. What I am very worried about is that people cannot afford -- -So your plan is to stay in, yes? -Well, you know, I just said... -Your plan is to stay -- -...that we are just -- Well, for the fourth time. -You're assessing it. -We are assessing. -Okay. Alright. -We are assessing our campaign. -Very good. -It's heartbreaking to see him not throw knock out punch at the debates. -They're going to have to look at the lessons from this year and figure out how to form a coherent left movement that not only has the right ideas but is ultimately serious about power. -On April 8th, Bernie Sanders suspends his presidential campaign. -Again, I'm not saying that we didn't make mistakes. I'm not saying that we ran a perfect campaign. But I am saying that anybody who pretends that this was a fair contest is just not being truthful. We were up against a media that felt existentially threatened by the agenda of Bernie Sanders. And all of that power was brought to bear against us. And that is a real dynamic, and that will be a real dynamic for any candidate who champions the same agenda moving forward. -Because if there's one thing that we learned in this campaign it is how powerful mainstream media still really is -- how much sway their narrative setting has over the public discourse. -Jeff Winchell performed a final analysis of the amount of coverage MSNBC gave Bernie Sanders throughout the campaign. In the early portion where he was the front runner, the other candidates were mentioned distinctly more. There are only two moments when Bernie received more coverage than other candidates -- after his super Tuesday loss and the day after he suspended his campaign. It's a glaring example of how the mainstream media chose to emphasize his campaigns problems and to undermine his successes. The campaign is over, but despite this loss his entire grass roots movement makes it clear that a new generation is willing to stand up against traditional power structures in America. -I think there is an exciting trend of new alternative media. -Independent media is on the rise and people are able to see the truth about different figures, whether it be negative or whether it be positive. -We're going to have to build a movement of all of us that is bigger than just Bernie Sanders himself. -People have to remain engaged. They have to reengage more. We have to deal with electoral politics and you have to be part of it. -A few years ago, I had to watch my mother lose the fight against lung cancer. And during that whole time when she should have just been focused on getting well there was that added stress and pain of the medical bills. The whole reason I'm out here in, you know, rain, sleet or snow is Medicare For All. -Environmental justice -- A Green New Deal not just being a transition away from fossil fuels but investing in those communities directly impacted by that transition. -The inequality in this country. The wealth inequality. The racial inequality. -For free education. I think it's for a smarter future and healthier future. -I have a preexisting condition and I don't want the health insurance industry to overcharge me just so that I can breathe decently. -If you think that health care, Medicare For All, being accessible to folks is radical, that public education should extend beyond K through 12 is radical then, yeah, I'm also radical. ♪♪ -The major challenge that we face is not only a redistribution of wealth, which is important, but a redistribution of power. Making the average American feel this is my country, this is a democracy. I can shape the future. The people don't feel that now. They sit down, they watch the tube for 40 or 50 hours a week, they hold their nose, they vote for the lesser of two evils. Now that, to me, is the major problem. And once we can begin to deal with that problem I think other things will follow. ♪♪
