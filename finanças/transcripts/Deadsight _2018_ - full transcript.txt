My wife, when she was pregnant with our daughter... ...she got really fat. She got as big as a house, and she was out of breath all the time... when she stood up, sat down, turned around, bent over, when she did pretty much anything. I think it's a boy. We can't stay. You need to rest. How did you get here? I don't remember. I woke up in the middle of nowhere, back of an ambulance. Everybody was gone. They were transferring me 'cause of, uh... I tried using the radio, but there's nobody out there. - This morning? - Yeah. I heard you. On the radio. That was you. You did? Okay. Ben, we need to get to that ambulance. No. No, it's It's not safe out there. It's not safe here. I have a gun. If you made it here, then we can make it there. Someone shot at me on the road. Well, they're not gonna shoot you this time. Stay right with me, okay? Hand on my shoulder. And don't talk. - Get down! - What?! What?! Mara? Mara? Are you okay? I'm fine. Oh, fuck. You can't come with me. What? I've got two bullets left. It's gonna be dark soon. Mara, you won't survive. Two bullets is not enough. I won't survive with you. Hello? Hello? I don't know if anyone can hear this. But this is Officer Mara Madigan. I'm in a farmhouse on Grey Route 19. There is a man named Ben Neilson in the basement. He's blind and wounded, but he's informed me that there is an ambulance somewhere. So I'm gonna go find it and come back for him. In case something happens to me... ...please, someone come get him. Over and out. It's me. - Where'd you go? - I got you an ax. - An ax? - Yeah. Jesus Christ. And... this. Wait. What's this for? Okay, it leads to the back door. I'm gonna go find the ambulance and bring it back here. Lock the door behind me. I shouldn't be more than an hour. I-I really think we should stay together. If something gets in, use the ax, follow the rope, and run. Where? Out the back. I'll meet you in the woods. Fuck. Hey. I'll find you. Mara? No. Oh, no! Oh, come on. Hello? Hello? No! No. Hello? Anyone? "Ben Neilson. House fire. Suspect in custody for suspicious deaths... one child, one adult. Possibly suicidal." Oh. Hello? Hello?! Hey! Huh? Hello? Here. No. It's for the shoulder. Right. Thought you were one of them. No hard feelings. Yeah. - Hey, you were on the road. - Yeah. Thought we already killed you. So did I. You keep shooting at me. That was my cousin Harlan. I'm the better shot. Where is he? He's gone. You a doctor? Mnh-mnh. No. You look like a doctor. No, I'm not a doctor. Take it. It's loaded. What am I supposed to do with it? You're gonna shoot me with it. What? I said, "You're gonna shoot me with it." No, I'm not. Well, you're gonna have to. Or what? I saw what they did to Harlan. What are you? Are you a coward? Yeah. I am. Why don't you just do it yourself? I couldn't do it. So I'm gonna sit here and keep talking... ...so you can know where to aim when you're ready. We thought we were ready. Thought we were ready for this. Harlan was talking about a program. A broadcast he heard about the flu shot mutating. So I thought I'd be all right. 'Cause I didn't get one. Aah! Fuck! Fuck! Ben?! Ben! Ben! Aah! Aah! Shit. Oh! No! - Mara? - Ben! - Mara! - Ben, I'm over here! - Mara, are you okay? - Yeah. - Did I hit you? - No. Are you all right? I thought I lost you. Not yet. We got to get out of here. - I'm okay. - You okay? Yeah, I got to sit down. Where's the ambulance? It's dead. You left it running. Fuck. I found something. What? Oh! Oh! Are you having contractions? No. I think it's just the stress. Has anything stressful happened to you recently? Okay. I'm having a contraction. Okay. Come on. Let's go. It's all right. Come on.
