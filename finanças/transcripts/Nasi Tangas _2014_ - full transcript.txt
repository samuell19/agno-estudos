"Spells, amulets, and charms are acts of idolatry.‚Äù Sunan Abu Daud Sir, I'm sorry. I kept this one for my boss. He booked it first. -It's alright. -Okay. Where's Hairi? Good morning. Hairi. You're late. Take a seat and eat this 'nasi lemak'. There was a customer who asked for this, but this is the last one left. -Why won't you let me rest for a bit. -No way. Enough talk. Sit here. Boss, do eat alright? This is your spoon, boss. I'll make some drinks for you, boss. -Here, your drink's ready. -Thank you. Is it alright? Delicious? Okay, these are all the wedding card samples. So, I'd like you to pick one. I need it today. If we delay this, the cards will be late too. Just pick one. -I'd like you to choose it. -I had to do this too? No. -How about this? -It's such a hassle. Fatin! What's up? I'm sure you' know my taste, right? Pick one for me. Wedding cards? -How much are you willing to pay me? -What? That's not going to happen. What are you smiling at? Go out there and attend to the guests! Thank you for coming. -Fatin! -Hairi. That's nothing. Just a small thing. Go back to the wedding dais, you're the groom. It's just a small matter. What's wrong with Fatin? I'm worried. I have no idea too, dear. Fatin and her antics. Another thing, I never thought I'd get married before Fatin does. I thought she's the one getting married first. It's really nothing. But I'd really like to see her settle down soon. She's really hard to understand. It felt like I'm the only one who understands her. She's a pretty girl. Why wouldn't anyone be interested in her? I'm having a talk and you're sleeping over there. Dear? Dear? Peace be upon you, mom. -Mom? -Hold on for a moment, dear. Hello, Fatin. What's the matter? Okay, I'll come right away. Dear, I have to go. 3 months later... Thank God! Fatin! You're so stubborn. I told you not to do a man's job, and you did it anyway. -It hurts. -Are you alright? Dear. What's the matter? Dear? You didn't care about me at all. Who says I don't care about you? It's true. I'm already pregnant, but you kept on ignoring me. You're pregnant? Fatin, my wife's pregnant! Dear! Dear! Peace be upon you. Mom? Mom? Bakar's love and passion shall bow down to me, with the blessings of..... -I want money! -I don't have any money. -I want money! -Don't do this to me! Please, dear. Where do you think you're going? Come here you! If you don't give me any money, you're going to regret it. What do you want? Who's this woman, dear? What are you trying to do? Get out! Dear, please don't do this! Please don't soil our house. After we've given birth,... ...our husbands will never treat or look at us the same way again. I consider myself even luckier than you, Mira. You haven't even gave birth, yet look at how he treats you. He seems reluctant, and doesn't listen to what you say right? It's called the bind of love. So the love has to be bound, right? So, this is the best way to bind that love for abused women such as us. But mom, isn't this the wrong thing to do? Who says it's wrong? Who are we doing this for? It's for our own husbands, right? It's not that we're doing it to someone else's. Is it wrong for our husbands to love us? Mom, what's that foul smell? If you want to, I'll introduce you to Embah Senu. It's alright, mom. I'll think about it first. Don't take too long. One day, you'll deeply regret it. I won't force you. But don't be in awe... ...if Fatin does the same thing that I did. Bakar! Bakar! Come here. What are you waiting for? Sit down. Sit down. Eat up. Actually, Fatin comes from the same place as Hairi. They went to school and studied in the university together. That's where I met him. They started this business right after completing their studies. Up until now. That's right. I see. Faiz, I'm sorry. Why don't you wait here. -I've got many customers today. -Okay. It's alright Fatin, don't worry. You both just have a chat. Just continue on chatting, I'll help out. Okay. -So, where are you from? -Kuala Lumpur. -Favourite food. -Your question's too cliche. Why did you ask Faiz to come over to our shop? I didn't ask him, he was the one who wanted to meet Fatin. Faiz seems like a weird person. He's not suitable with Fatin. You don't have to matchmake the both of them. Just let her be. She can find her own partner. Just let her be. You're jealous, aren't you? Why would I? I knew it. You're actually jealous. It's because you had feelings for Fatin, right? You were scared to ruin your friendship with her,... ...so you married me instead. I'm just a scapegoat. She's just a good friend of mine. She's my business partner. So you say she's your best friend. So why do you always favor her more than me? Who's your wife? Fatin or Mira? If you really want her, just go to her! Go ahead, slap me! Dear! Dear! Dear! Things just happen, it's not that we asked it to be this way. Once Mira's out of the hospital, just take a leave alright? Don't think too much about the cafe. Just let me handle it. There must be something that's bothering her mind,... ...that lead to her miscarriage. Have a taste. Thank you, aunty. I don't know, mom. I'm at fault here. If only we didn't fight. We wouldn't lose our baby. Fatin, I think we should make a move now. It's not nice to stay for too long. I'll make a move now. Aunty, I'll be going now. What's the matter? Dear, why are you in such a rush? Dear, I've got lots of work to do. Fatin couldn't handle it anymore, there's too many order from the customers. But I promise, I'll come back home for lunch alright? We'll eat together. Okay? Another thing I'd like to remind you, no heavy housework for you. Just have a good rest, alright? Where did you come from? Where's Hairi? Hello, Hairi. Where are you? Did you have another fight with Mira? No. Why did she come alone to the shop? What are you babbling about? She's right beside me. Did you do anything to Fatin? Why? She's sick, mom. She kept having nightmares. She says there's something haunting her, mom. So, it's true then, mom? Mira. You're not supposed to think about her. You should be thinking about yourself instead. Even more after you've had the miscarriage. Are you aware that there's nothing left to bind Hairi to you? Embah. I've explained to her a bit on how to go about the spell. But I think it's better if you explain it to her yourself. For a young woman such as yourself, do it once you had your period. It's more effective if you do it before dawn. Yes. But Embah, will doing this have any side effects? It'll be a waste of effort and time if there aren't any side effects. How so? The side effect will be that your husband loves you even more. He'll never look at others anymore. Isn't that what you wanted? Fatin, are you sure you're alright? That's right. I'm okay. Don't worry. Let me take you to a healer, alright? There's no need to. I'm okay. -It's just a nightmare. I'm okay. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. -Mom? Hairi called me and asked me to look after you. -Who's this? -I'm Faiz, aunty. Dear. Where are you going? I've already told you. -Pest control are coming to the cafe. -I'd like to catch a movie. I've told you earlier. Some other time then. The movies will still be there. Enough. I'll make a move now. Relax. I'm watching it closely. Offside! What do you mean an offside? Fatin! Your team lost. Serves you right. You've cooked rice early in the morning. I'm at fault even if I cook or don't cook. That's just you. If Fatin cooks, I'm sure you'll eat all of it, right? There's no need to be angry early in the morning. It doesn't matter. It's alright if you don't want to eat it. Dear. Who says I don't? But not right now, I've got a meeting to go to. Why don't you pack this up for me. So that I can eat it at the cafe. Okay? If you don't want to, it's alright, I don't mind. It's alright. I'll pack it up for you. Dear, wait up. This is the most special rice I've cooked for you. So I need you to finish it, alright? Don't share it with anyone, alright? I don't like you sharing it with Fatin. Okay. -Promise me, dear. -Yes, I promise. -I'll get going now. -Dear. I really love you, alright? So that means I don't love you too? I do love you, don't I? Fatin, are you okay? I'm okay. My mom's worried sick about me. I wonder how many times she had called me today. If I was your mom, I'd be worried too. You were dreaming of talking to ghosts and all. Have a laugh at me. Once it's your turn, then you'll know. -No, it won't. -Eat up. I'm going to check on the stocks. -Yours is RM23. -RM23? Yes. Thank you. Mira, why did you pack the rice for your husband? How come I saw you wrapping it with the banana leaf? I did that to get rid of the pungent smell of... ...the faeces I put in together with the rice! You're still new to this, Mira. You should've made him eat it in front of you. You're different than me. I've made it. You're still learning the ropes. You should've fed him the rice... ...when he's in front of you, so can see it for yourself. Even if I don't see your father eating it,... ...at least he already took the bait. -Be careful. Mira's going to have a fit. -That's one lucky catch. -I got panicked. -So you're afraid. Fatin, come here for a moment. Come here. What's the matter? Smell the rice. Has it gone bad? -Perhap it's the salted fish. -There's a salted fish inside? Why you. It's delicious. It tastes alright to me. -If you don't want it, give it to me. -It's alright, then. I promised Mira, I'm the only one who can eat this. She'll sulk if I don't. -I'm going to do some work at the back. -Yes. No, I already told him ,mom. He promised he won't... ...share it with anyone. You're so simple minded, Mira. If all the promises the men made can be trusted,... ...we wouldn't have to resort to witchcraft! Idiot! I've shown you the way yet you don't know how to use it. It's just the same, mom. There's nothing different. What am I going to do, mom. Wait for a while, Mira. I think you're right, he didn't eat the rice. I wasted my time making that rice, mom. Calm down, don't make any sudden assumptions yet. Wait and see, alright? Alright, mom. Okay, mom. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Dear. Dear. Dear, wake up. Dear, you'll be late for work. Wake up. You're fooling around, aren't you? Wake up! Does it hurt? Where does it hurt? -It's nothing. I was just playing around. -Enough, get up. -Hold on for a moment. -What? -There's something that I need to tell you. -Something? -What's that? -But you have to promise me. You won't get mad at me, alright? -What's the matter? -Promise me first. Okay. Okay. Come here. The rice that you gave me yesterday. Fatin tasted it for a bit. But, it was not on purpose. Have you forgotten? I reminded you, didn't I? Don't share it with anyone. Dear, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, alright? Dear. -I'd like to get something. -I'm about to go back. Alright. Why is Mira in the car? Mira? She's not there. Don't be ridiculous. Just go home. Hairi! Give it to him. Thank you. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Are you alright? I'm okay, mom. It's nothing. But, I've already asked an 'ustaz'. There's something dirty inside of you, Fatin. There's someone with a close connection who sent it to you. I think this is all Mira's doing. Mom, why do you say so? It's impossible that she would do that, mom. -Enough, I don't believe it. -You're just the same with Faiz. Both of you didn't believe that it was Mira's doing. Mom, Faiz is Mira's good friend. That's enough, I've got lots of work to do. -I'll call you back. -Alright. Hairi, where have you been? Why are you so late today? -Can I have your order? -I'd like an iced tea. -Iced tea. -Give me one chicken fried rice. -Chicken fried rice, alright? -Make it quick, alright? -You? -Just give me the same one. -Where's my fried mee? -I'll make my move now. -Where's my noodles? -Hold on for a moment. -My rice's not here yet as well. -Really. Hold on, alright? Hairi, there's so many customers. Can you leave me alone? Handle it yourself. What's your problem? Where are you going? Help me out. Don't think that you're the only boss around here! Are you okay? Come. I'm sorry, Fatin. I didn't mean it. If you're unwell, just take a rest. Or you can just go home. Are you okay? -Dear. -Dear. -Dear, do you want to catch a movie? -Okay, let's go. -Hi, Fatin. -Hi. -Let's go. -Let's go. Hairi! Are you okay? It's okay, I'll help you out tonight alright? Mom, he seems tired all the time. He sleeps all the time. That's normal, Mira. Initially, he'll become like that. You'll get used to it eventually. How could you make fun of me. Why would I make fun of you. This is the chance to ask for anything that you've wanted. I can guarantee that he'll give it to you. If you don't trust me, try it for yourself. -Dear. -Yes, dear. -Can we go shopping tomorrow? -Sure. -Get up here. -Through here? Sure. No. I'm just kidding. Hairi! Where are you taking the money? It's my money! -You sure have a lot of money. -I want to use it! Hairi! -Is it pretty, dear? -It's pretty. I spent a lot of money on you. What are you talking about? You're insincere, aren't you? -If that's so, take it back! -Dear. Don't act this way. Is it wrong for me to show my affection... ...towards my wife? It's not wrong, right? -Do you really love me? -I do. If you really love me,..... Dear. I'm tired. Dear,..... Take a look at this. It's close to RM50,000 that our account doesn't tally. The supplier doesn't want to send the goods anymore. You've taken eight days of MC so far. What's your problem? If you think of me as troublesome. I can withdraw myself. I can sell all my shares to you, do you want it? What are you talking about? Look at this place. It's empty. If this is how it looks like, your shares won't be any use at all! So you say it's worthless to sell my shares. Okay, let's cut it short. Sell all your shares to me. Why are you silent all of a sudden. Fatin. Fatin! Come here. Start by reciting Bismillah. Then, with just one breath, drink this. Finished? Do you see the black rice? That's the dirty ingredient that won't be digested by your stomach. Ustaz. Can you tell who casted the spell? We'll return this back to her. You'll know who soon enough. -Why, ustaz? -She has a deep hatred towards you. Eating the food is one mistake. She even sent the 'saka' to your house. That's the reason why you're having those nightmares. Fatin, my child. -What's the matter, Ton? -It's hot, I'm uncomfortable tonight. Water! Stronger. You're such a sissy. Do you feel better? -What's the matter? -Nothing. You're making such a fuss. -Dear, where are you going? -I have to go to the cafe. What do you mean? We're going back to mom's place, right? Dear, the cafe's in trouble. Fatin called, and she's angry. Fatin's angry? What about if I get angry? Dear, I won't be long. I promise we'll go to mom's place after I'm done. Dear. If you step out of the house, don't you dare come back here. Dear. Forgive me, dear? I'm not mad at you. It's just that the cafe's really under trouble right now. -Okay, you can go ahead. -I'll go, alright? What's so important that the both of you needed to see me? It's like this, Hairi. Me and Fatin have agreed to help you. We want you to be treated. Why's that? Hairi, please don't act this way. Don't ask why. If you think of me as a good friend, then listen to us. Follow us now so we can get you treated. Right now. There's no need to think about it. Let's go. -We're going right now? -Let's go. I can't. -I have to go back. -Hairi! Hairi! -What are you doing? -Nothing, dear. Have a seat. You need to eat a lot today, alright? I don't have much appetite today, dear. I'll just drink this water, alright? The woman realized my husband's changes, Embah. She told me she went to seek for treatment. She said that my husband and herself took the wrong food. I'm scared. I think they've found out. My husband no longer has the appetite to eat at home, Embah. What should we do, Embah. I don't want my happiness... ...to dissapear just like that, Embah. It's a wasted effort for me to do all those spell. If he doesn't want to eat at home. We'll try another way. But make sure that the ingredients are correct. So that it'll be better than the past. How do we do that, Embah. It's not just rice that you can put a spell on. Water has the same effect as well. The best part is you do't have to wait for your period. The most important part are the ingredients. Three things needed from each ends of your body. First, the end of your hair. Second, the end of your feet. The third one, the end of your intestines, which is your faeces. -What are you cooking? -Noodles, dear. Can I have a taste? Why does it tastes different? It's not delicious, dear? I accidently put on extra oyster sauce. The oyster sauce. No wonder it's delicious. I'll take more for you, alright? Here you go, dear. How dare you? I've known all your dirty tricks, alright? I've known it for a long time now! That's why I went to seek for treatment. You fed me this rice that you squatted on? You had a 'saka' didn't you? Eat up! Eat this! Finish the rice. You're crazy! You asked me to fear you. You suppressed my feelings till my head wants to explode. Do you know that my head just feels like exploding? You're finished. I'll teach you a lesson. I heard a neighbour said that... ...Pak Bakar and Mak Ton were having a big fight on the night before he died. It's because Pak Bakar caught Mak Ton... ...in the act while squatting on the rice. If that's the case,... ...I'm not surprised if Mira follows her mom's footsteps. Just look at Hairi. What happened to him? Hairi, I've got something to tell you. I've nothing to say to you, Fatin. You've become the victim of black magic, do you know that? Please, listen to me. Follow me now. Please, before it's too late. Stay away from my husband! Leave! Get out of here! Leave my family alone! Dear. Mom! Dear, why aren't you inside the room yet? Did you hear people talking, about mom... ...getting caught while casting a spell when dad died? Do you trust others more than me? Do you know, how I feel tormented? I felt fear all the time. I couldn't have a say at anything. I've felt like I've become less of a man, Mira. Speak up, Mira. I swear to you, I never did all those things. You can trust me. Dear. Why do you accuse me of this? Dad just passed away. You don't love me, do you? Mira. I'm sorry alright? I'm sorry. Don't cry. -Let's go to bed? -Forgive me, alright? Yes, I forgive you. Let's go to bed, shall we? Our business is already closed down I think we can start to talk to the lawyers... ...regarding the asset division. It's alright Hairi. I won't take a cent out of it. You can have all of it. I'd like to ask just one thing from you. Follow me and get yourself treated. Mira swore to me. She didn't do it. Hairi, even if it's not Mira, perhaps it's someone else. Hairi, please. You've been such a good friend to me all these while. I don't want to see you die like your father-in-law did, alright? Mom, I'm scared. I don't know what else to do. Mom, I don't want to lose Hairi. Mom, please help me. Mom, I love Hairi. I don't want to lose him, mom. I've nobody else in this world. I only have you. Please don't just stay silent. Mom, say something. Do you see all these? These are the ingredients for making the 'tangas'. It'll never be digested by your stomach. If you're unable to extract it out spiritually. Embah, you have to help me. My husband suspected me. I don't want to lose my husband, Embah. Please. We have to prepare a greater and better 'tangas'... ...to make your husband bow down to you. I'm scared that he won't eat it, Embah. If you ask him to eat, he'll surely eat it. How are we going to do it? When's your period cycle? It just started yesterday. This is the right moment to create the most perfect 'tangas'. But we need to add the black glutinous rice as well. What are the ingredients, Embah? Is it the same as before? The condition is that you need to sleep... ...with another man that's not your husband. He must know how to recite the spells such as yours. And you have to follow my orders closely... ...in order to create the 'tangas' rice. Ultimately, your husband will surely bow down completely to you. But, Embah. Where will I find that kind of man? If you need help, I'm ready to offer assistance. It's all in your hands. The decision's in your hands. Mom! Mom, where's Mira? Mom, where's Mira? Mom! Mom, say something. Do you want her to become like dad? Mom, speak up. Say something. Say it. Say it. Mira! Mira? Who are you to mess around here? Get up! Hairi's love will only see me. Hairi's love and affection..... Dear God! Mira! Wake up! Mira? Dear. Mira? Mira! It's me. -Mira? -It's Mira, dear. Hairi, move aside. This is the devil's trick. Move aside. Mira? Mira. Dear. Fatin. Everything that happened is because of me. I didn't understand her. I couln't read her feelings. I was being insensitive. I thought everything will work out after we got married. But, I'm the fool here. I never think it through. A relationship has to have give and take. It has to have understanding too. Enough, Hairi. You can't blame it on yourself. Perhaps, there's a reason why this happened. If I could, I'll take care of Mira until the day I die. I don't know whether she can feel it or not. I'd like to redeem all the mistakes I had done before. I want to prove that I really love her. Mom. I'm here to say goodbye. I promise you, I'll take good care of Mira alright? If there's time, I'll bring her to see you, alright? Mom. Mom. Mom, I've forgiven you. But he doesn't forgive me yet. I know you're hungry. I couldn't take care of you anymore. Go and look for a new owner elsewhere. Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him,... ...but He forgives what is less than that forwhom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin. An-Nisa: 48
