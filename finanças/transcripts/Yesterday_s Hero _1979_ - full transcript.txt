[TRAIN WHISTLE] [THEME SONG] [SINGING] We played for the fun and we run for the glory, and it all seemed to happen so fast. You used to love me, but now you ignore me and my name is a thing of the past. I didn't ask you for fortune and fame, I was happy to do with the love. You made me a fool, but I played the game. Well, I gave all I had, but I guess it just wasn't enough. Now listen to him singing, here he comes, yesterday's hero. Here he comes, yesterday's hero. Have you seen a dragon when he is in danger, how he runs from the scene of the crime. But I didn't listen to my intuition, it was there in the back of my mind. Now yes, I should have seen him coming, well, it's happened before, and it was only a matter of time. Now, listen to him singing. Here he comes, yesterday's hero. Here he comes, he's yesterday's hero. Well, you called me the best, now you call me a yesterday's hero. You call me the best, now you call me a yesterday's hero. Just a yesterday's hero. [MUSIC FADE-OUT] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] ANNOUNCER: (OVER PA) The kick-off in the Queen's match will be at 3:15 PM. Please leave-- Will you sign this, please? Will you sign this, please? Will you sign this, please? Here you are, son. Oh, thanks. Will you sign this, please? Yeah, sure. What's your name? Mark. Thanks, son. Thanks, Rod. I've got a meeting with the directors tomorrow. I reckon I'm out. What makes you think that? When was the last time we won a game? Well, they should spend some money like Clint Simon over at stage, shouldn't they? Oh, come on, Rod. The Saints got lucky. A big rock star takes them over as his hobby, how often does that happen? He's done a good job since he took over as chairman. I mean how many other third division clubs make the quarterfinals of the FA cup? Well, he spent money. See ya. All right, George, see you Monday. Yeah, OK then. All right, Georgie. Yeah, be lucky. Give you a lift? Nah, I don't want to go home, I feel like getting pissed. Good night, boys. Good night. Good night, Matt. Good night, Matt. Good night, lads. [SHARP KNOCKING ON DOOR] SUSAN: Rod? Rod? [KEY IN LATCH] Oh, my God! Wake up! You smell like a pig. Must be Susan. Remember me? Where were you last night? Oh, the bus broke down again. Liar. [HACKING LOUDLY] What time is it? 12:30. Oh, no! Well, why didn't you wake me earlier? I just got here. Mm. Yeah, well you-- you know that, uh-- I don't like to be late on a Sunday. Just you hold on. Mm? Hold on, I'll be back. That's charming! Hold on! It's not Rod's fault, we lost the game. - Your Rod can't play anymore. - Who says? Who says that? - All of these papers say so. He's right, you know. Listen, Rod's the best. Always has been, always will be. He had a bad patch, that's all. Happens to everybody, doesn't It? - Hello, Dad. - Hello, Rod, old boy. Hello, Rod. Hello, Rod. Rod. Hello, Rita. How's it going? Not too bad, how's yourself? Not bad, not good. Let me have five pints and then I'll have a scotch. Look, Rod, I wouldn't mention it myself. You know it's not up to me. I got the word before we opened today, I can't give you anything more on the tab. Oh. I'm sorry. Well, in that case, make it five pints and I'll have a large scotch. Keep the change. Right. - [INAUDIBLE] - Well, hello! Well done! Cheers! Good lad, Roddy. - Hi, Mack. - The usual. Bye, love. Well, I was right. Yeah, it's the old elbow. Finish the season, then bye-bye. - I'm sorry, Mack. - Here you go, Mack. Thanks, Rita. Cheers. Cheers. Well, I'm not going to hang around waiting for your next. Georgie Moore's in town from America. Georgie More? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you used to be teammates, didn't you? That's right. He's looking to sign some new players, football's really taking off over there. Yeah, so I hear. I'm going to have a drink with him. Nice work if you can get it. You'll get it. Lend me a fiver. Can never work out what you did with all that money you made. It went, didn't it? You first you had the tax man, and the women, and then the hangers-on. And throwing the cards and the clothes and the money. Since when have you changed. I haven't. If you could cut down on the booze, you'd be a damned sight better player. Not with the kindergarten we play with. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, take care, Roddy. Cheers, fellas. Cheers, Rob. You've got to go, have you? Have again, Rita. Oi, fellas! [CHILDREN YELLING EXCITEDLY] Hi, Rod! Hi, Rod! Come on, get in. All set. All right? One, two. Shut those doors! All right, Sunshine? I told you, don't call me Sunshine, Marek's my name. We No, I'll remember that, Sunshine. All right, go on, join in. Go on. You know I can't play football. Well, join the club, then, come on, join the club. Come on, give me that ball! Oi, come here. Give me that ball, and get your clothes on, You! Come on, in. [MUSIC - TOTO, "HOLD THE LINE"] Hold the line, love isn't always on time. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's not in the words that you told me. Dude, what are you doing? Spring cleaning. Hey! That's Ingrid. And Katrina, now she was a lovely girl. Mm-hmm. I'm throwing them away. Yeah? Why? You'll be moving soon, and you won't want all this junk. Moving? Moving where? Out of this dump and in with me, of course. I don't remember discussing moving. I thought you'd like the idea. I mean, my place is so much nicer than this rat-trap. Can't you see that? Yes, well, uh-- honestly Susan, you're a nice girl, and we see each other twice a week. We go to bed twice a week. So we go to bed twice a week, it doesn't mean to say we're moving in together. Look, I don't want to discuss this now. Neither do I! You've got a hangover. I'll phone you tomorrow. [MUSIC STARTS FAINTLY] [SINGING] I won't be lost again. It's over now, I'm out of love with love. It's the one thing I'm tired of thinking of. I've heard enough of the meaning of love. It don't mean a thing when you lose. I learned how to play and there's nothing to say but goodbye to my rainy days. (Goodbye to my rainy days.) I'm out of love with love. Doot, doo. [SPOKEN] I like your hat. [SINGING] Out of love with love. (Out of love, I'm out of love with love, out of love.) Out of love with love. (Out of love, I'm out of love with love, out of love.) No more falling in love. (Out of love, I'm out of love with love, out of love.) Out of love with love. (Out of love, I'm out of love with love, out of love.) No more falling in love. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Miss Cloudy Martin! Isn't she great? Kiss, kiss. [MUSIC, "WE GOT US"] [SINGING TOGETHER] We got us! (SPEAKING) Our new single, I hope you like it. [SINGING] You ain't no lady. You ain't no gent. [TOGETHER] We got no TV and we've spent the rent. I got you. You got me. [TOGETHER] We got us. Don't go to parties. Don't go to balls. [TOGETHER] We got each other when the evening falls. I got you, you got me, we got us. (We got us.) [TOGETHER] We got us, whatever happens. We got us and that's all that matter. We got us and we don't need nobody else. We got us and we don't need nobody else. The roof is leaking, the house is cold. I'd sell my jewelry, but it's all been sold. But I got you. You got me. [TOGETHER] We got us. (We got us.)

[SINGING] We got us, whatever happens. We won! No! Great! Yes! Listen, I'm sorry to stop the song in mid-flow, but I just had a great piece of news. The Saints have done it! Wembley. We're on our way to Wembley! That's fantastic! [SINGING] Whatever happens. We got us and that's all that matters. We got us and we don't need nobody else. We got us, whatever happens. We got us and that's all that matters. We got us. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Why didn't you tell me you were going to bring me out here. I just got off the plane, I look awful. Oh, come on, you look great. Susan. Oh, so you're back. I've tried to phone you all week. You've been-- (BELCHES LOUDLY) Rod, are you listening to me? Mm, I'm listening. Oh, I should have known you'd walk in drunk. You're very lucky that I didn't walk in with another girl. I don't know why I bother with you. Mm. Why bother, then? Look, I thought we discussed all this last week. Don't you want me to stay? I want you to do whatever you want to do. Oh, yeah, let's get the last five minutes of Sports Net. Oh, Rod! [SWITCHES ON TV] SPORTS ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) --for the final. [INAUDIBLE]. SPORTS ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) John Kithers. No doubt about it, but since this Third Division team was taken over by Clint Simon, they haven't got a foot wrong. Jake Marsh has masterminded their almost unbelievable ascent. And today they proved, yet again, that they are winners all the way, with a victory over Birmingham Rovers. This win, of course, puts them in the FA Semifinal. They only black spot for Clint Simon and the Saints today, was striker, John Snatcher, getting himself badly injured in a crash with Jeff-- Turn it off, Rod. SPORTS ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) It's not been confirmed yet, just-- Let's forget about football just this once. [SNORING] So he snatched his leg for a good one, there's no way he's going to be playing in the semifinal. I've searched around for players, I've put a lot of feelers out. Might get one in a hurry, but nothing. They don't want to know about coming down from the First Division to a Third Division club. I don't mind paying, Jake. It's not money, Clint. We need a good striker, fast. We're in a bad position. What about O'Donohue? No, he's not good enough to bring out of the reserves yet. They'd shit his pants. No, we've got to find ourselves a really good, experienced player. I had an idea. What? It's uh-- a little off-beat. But I think it might work. Your ideas have done pretty well for the club up till now. Rod Turner. What? He was the best bloody striker in the business. When I was a kid, I never missed a game every Saturday. He was magic. I don't believe this! Rod Turner! The man's a drunk, for God's sake. He's a has-been. I told you it was an offbeat idea. But I just got a feeling. A guy who played like Rod did, it's still got to be in there somewhere. And you could bring it out, Jake. Old, slow, drunk. All right. Let's see him play. Old, slow, drunk. Look at how heavy he is on his feet. That guy used to run like a panther. All right, so he's not at his best. We didn't expect him to be. He stinks. Didn't you play together one season? One season was enough. He was always a big-headed bastard. Yeah, but you could get him together, Jake. With training and discipline you could have him back in-- You've made your mind up, haven't you? I think it'll work. All right, you're the boss. But you know how I feel about it, the guy is a loser. Look I'm going to go round and talk to him after the game. Do you want to come? Ooh, I'll pass. ANNOUNCER: (OVER PA) Support your team next week when they're playing away. Hi, Clint, can I have your autograph, please? ANNOUNCER: (OVER PA) Auto-coach will leave at 10:30 from the players' entrance. Thank you. Hey, Rod! Hey, Rod. Hey! I see Clint Simon's here with Jake Marsh. Yeah? And a couple of directors from the Saints. What do you think they want? Well, maybe they want to buy the club. Yeah, you think so? Well, what does money mean to someone like Clint Simon. Some people collect stamps, maybe he collects football clubs. I was hoping we could talk, Rod. Yeah, what about? I have a proposition for you. Something of mutual interest. Can we go for a drink? I've got a drink. No, thanks. Well, do you want a kiss, autograph? No. I want to buy you for the Saints. You're joking. Never more serious. [LAUGHING] Oh, Jesus! Look, Rod. I love football, and I've done a very good job with the Saints. I didn't buy it as a tax loss, you know. And why did you buy it then? To win! I'm involved with the club on every level. In between making records. Come on, Rod, I'm making you an offer you should jump at. I gave up jumping a long time ago. Look, I've got a recording session in Paris, tomorrow. Why don't you come along for the ride? I'll send a car for you. Will you come? I'll think about it. Time to get tarted up to meet Georgie. What about Paris, tomorrow. Are you going? Certainly. Better than sitting around here, isn't it? Tomorrow, we go round and Marek and the boys at their club here and take a half and have a nice practice. Oh, come on, Rod. I promised the wife I'd take her out. One day, Matt, please. You know how much they look forward to it. Mr. Turner to see Mr. Moore, please. Mr. Turner for you, sir. 116. 116, thank you. (WHISPERING) It's Rod Turner. Georgie Moore? Yeah, I'm Candy. I might even get him to come back. Wouldn't you like that? Whatever turns you on. Yeah, and uh-- what? Hang on, Marvin, the other phone. Georgie! The very same, well who did you expect, the president? Baby, it's been too long! Come on, hustle your ass, get the man a drink. - Drink? - Scotch. With? Without. OK, listen, uh-- well, listen I'll get back to you. Yeah? I'll phone you tomorrow. Well, you got to do something to keep warm. OK, ciao, baby, ciao. Hey, man, you know you look really great. No, I mean, no kidding. No, I mean, you do look great. You look as if things are going your way. You know, moving to America was the best frigging thing I ever did. I was um-- I was thinking of going to the states myself. You know, if you were only 10 years younger. I could offer you the Empire State Building, but you know, I mean, we are after young players. Yeah. Tell you what I'll do. I could check with one of the coast teams, see if they need a coach. Coach, you're kidding. OK, so I mean, you were a big star over here. Over there, they haven't even heard of you. So any reason I should forget it? No. No, no, no. Find out what's happening. I could do with a change anyway. Well, you'll have to excuse Candy and me, we're getting all set for a little private conference, you know? Maybe I'll get back to you later. Yeah, that might be difficult because I'm supposed to go to Paris with Clint Simon tomorrow. Clint Simon! Really? You know Clint Simon? Wants me to sign with the Saints. It's a lot of money, I'm just-- I'm just not sure. I haven't made up my mind, yet. Mm-hmm. Can't be bad. I'll call you Monday, then. Yeah, do that. Candy, thank you for the drink. Hey, Cloudy. Yeah. What is it with you today, you seem as nervous as a cat. I'm fine, why? You seem very jumpy. Oh, I don't know. Where is this footballer of yours? He'll be here. I hate waiting around. Why'd you ask him, anyway? Because I want to get to know him. Here's a guy who was the absolute best. You should see now, he looks like an old man. - He does? - Yeah, Jake says he's a drunk. But Jesus, Cloudy, this guy was my God. I just know he can do it for us. Well, I sure hope he's worth the effort. Everyone's worth the effort. I mean look at you. Trotting around the States doing nothing gigs, going with guys who treated you like shit. Well, I never denied that you're the one who saved me. Made you a star. You made me, anyway. It's the only way I could get your attention. One of these days, perhaps you'll tell me what pushed you into that self-destructive kick. Well, you see, I was badly treated as a child. He's here. I'd better play captain and greet him. Hey, Rod, you made it. Welcome aboard. Wouldn't let a fan down. Rod say hello to, uh-- Cloudy Martin. Hello, Cloudy. Hello, Rod. Don't tell me you two know each other. Not really. Clint, Captain says he has clearance. Shall I tell him it's OK? Sure, let's go. I reckon you've got everything to gain and nothing to lose. Yeah, well, I reckon you've got it wrong way around. I mean, right now I'm anonymous. Newspapers have forgotten about me. If I come back to the Saints, I mean you can imagine the headlines, can't you, you know, aging striker has returned. What can the old bugger do? Bullshit like that. What you're telling me is you don't think you can do it. I didn't say that. No, but that's what you mean. I don't agree. Jake Marsh will have you back in action before you know it. Yeah. I'll have [INAUDIBLE] or a job in America. Just haven't made up my mind, yet. Come on, Rod, give it a try. We need you for the semi. We really do. You mean, I'm all you can get. Stick with the Saints, we're going places. Hey, how about another drink before you start training tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, I've worked out a deal with Windsor, you're all ours from tomorrow. All I needed was a yes from you. Well, I haven't said yes, yet. [MUSIC, "THAT'S NOT WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR"] [SINGING] Every time we move in together, I get the same old feeling, yeah. We're two people in love with one another, we treat each other like we just don't care. That's not what we came here for, there's still time to love one another, and that's not what we came here for. All we gotta do is love one another. Everytime we move in together. Can't help but wonder why. When we should be helping one another. You make angry. You make me cry. That's not what came here for, there's still time to love one another. And that's not what we came here for. All we gotta do is love one another, care for each other, feel for each other, love one another. Baby! Ooh, love, we're old enough, we got love enough, we can talk about it. Baby! I Just want to see you smile, see you smile awhile. (We can talk about it, baby!) It could be so loving, so loving and so easy, babe. (We can talk about it, baby!) It can still feel good, it can still feel good, yeah, yeah! (We can talk about it!) We could talk about it. (That's not what we came here for, there's still time to love one another, and, that's not what we came here for.) We still got time to love one another, yeah. That's not what we came here for. Still time to love one another, and that's not what we came here for. All we got to do is love one another, care for each other, feel for each other, love one another! That's not what we came here for. We still got time to love one another and, that's not what we came here for. Ooh, baby! We can still be together. Still time to love one another, and that's not what we came here for. Still time to love one another, and that's not what we came here for. That's not what we came here for. OK, all right, let's kill it. OK, let's take a break. Ooh, that was good. You want a drink? Yeah, champagne. You do know him, don't you? I don't know him. We slept together, but it was a long time ago. I was just a little girl and he was a big star. I really believed that I was the only one in his life. I'm surprised he even remembers me, actually. Why didn't you tell me all this before? What difference would it have made? It could have made a lot of difference. I'm sorry, you're right. I hope today wasn't too uncomfortable for you. I just wish you had told me, that's all. But you know how I care about you. Yeah, I know, you love me like a brother, you always tell me that. Well, it's the only kind of love that doesn't go sour, right? If that's the way you want it. But if you ever feel-- Clint, don't. With our two egos, you know, it wouldn't work. [JET ENGINE LANDING] You all right, darling? Shall I wait? Yeah, yeah. Rod, the uh-- sooner I have your answer, the better. Will you call me tomorrow? Yeah, I'll try. But I've got a few things to work out, you know. But thanks for the daytrip. It reminded me of old times. Yeah, I guess it would. Rod? Mm? What? About Cloudy, she's a very special lady, means a lot to me. Let's leave the past in the past, OK? Suits me. Suits all of us. [SINGING] Everytime we move in together-- hm, mm, mm. [SPEAKING] Aye, yi, yi, yi, yi. [SINGING, "THAT'S NOT WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR"] Da da dee da da duh duh. Mm, mm, mm, mm. [SPEAKING] Yes, let's leave the past in the past, Rod. It uh-- suits them both further. Uh-huh. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Uh, yes. Just a second. WAITER: Will that be all? Thank you. Rod Turner. Thank you, [INAUDIBLE] thank you. Hello, Georgie, how are things going? Well, it's fine. Look, Rod, um-- I want to go back to the States in morning. Yeah, well it's about the job in America, I mean, I really want to go, but I do have to know now. Why don't I phone you from the States, say in a couple of weeks, yeah? Yeah, OK, I'll get you something going. Mm-hmm. OK, ciao, baby. Phony. Mr. Simon, you've got yourself a player. I do? Yeah, America can wait, I'll see you through the season. That's fantastic, Rod, you've made my day. [INDISTINCT SOUNDS OF MEN PLAYING FOOTBALL] Jake? You two know each other. You better get your ass out here and start training, hadn't you? That's what I'm here for. Really? I heard you'd given up training. Well, look. I've got to split, I'll see you both later. Good luck, Rod. Cheers. - How 'bout it, Jake? - John! Put him to work, will you? Just want to welcome you to the Saints. - Oh, thanks. - Me and the boys. Yeah. Yeah, very pleased. It's great we're gonna play with you. Nice to know somebody wants me. Well, you don't want take no notice of the boss, he's a rotten bastard at the best of times. It's good to have you with us, Rod. Oh, yeah. He's a good manager, he's just a rotten bastard. He's have you training, and you'll be so knackered at the end of day, you know, you think you just played Arsenal. Yeah. Hey, you know, my dad used to take me to see you when I was a kid. - Yeah? Yeah, straight up. He's going to be so pleased you're playing with us now. Well, today was really good, you know. All apart from that asshole, Jake Marsh, breathing fire down my neck all day. I think you must be mad signing up with the Saints. I mean, playing in a semifinal at your age could set a new record. Oh, thank you for the vote of confidence. Aren't you hungry? Suddenly, I lost all my appetite. You know, Susan, now I'm into serious training, I'm going to be tied up for the next few weeks, so why don't we just cool it for awhile, all right? I get enough aggravation from Marsh, I certainly don't need it from you. If that's what you want. It is. Call you after the game. Thanks, I can't wait. Getting too much for you, Turner? Clint bought the wrong dog. Come on, Turner, harder! Rod? Come and have a picture. How are you? Quick snap, JAKE MARSH: Turner. Turner! When you can spare the time, mate. Back to work. I think you can do with all the training you can get, son. You can pick today, your choice. Marek, here we go, come here. You're the best, Rod, your team's always winning. I've never even played for them, yet. One, two, three, pull. Can I come see the final at Wembley? What? I might not win the semifinal. Sure you will, Rod, you can do anything. Oh, yeah. Stay there. Oi! Ready! ANNOUNCER: (OVER PA) So the two teams coming out together, then, for this FA Cup Semifinal. Hamilton United wearing blue shirts and white shorts. And the Saints in their lucky colors, the yellow shirts and blue shorts they've worn throughout the competition. The ground is absolutely packed for this match. And Saints with Rod Turner playing at center forward, recalled from the soccer wilderness, getting all the attention before the kickoff. I wonder what effect Turner will have on this semifinal. [WHISTLE BLOWS] So Saints kick-off playing from left to right, in the first half. The prize, of course, a place at Wembley. And already, it's Saints on the attack with the ball. It's Jimmy Thomas trying to set the attack up down the right hand side. The ball put into the penalty area. From Hamilton who gets the ball away. But [INAUDIBLE] made a good positive start here. That's Chris Walford out to Eddie Lewis. Eddie Lewis on the right wing, trying make ground. Jimmy Thomas makes a run down the right-hand side, wearing number 10. Quiet. Quiet. I can't hear the commentary. ANNOUNCER: But it's still Saints moving moving. Butch Jackson involved in that attack. Now it's Thomas. Thomas gets the ball inside. Turner goes in. The ball in the penalty area. It's Thomas again. Here's Jasper Turner! But still [INAUDIBLE] far more of the ball. That's Thomas again on the right. And the ball has crossed into the penalty area. [CHEERING] Well, what a first half the Saints are having here. They're completely on top. That's Lewis again to Walford. Can he pull the ball into the center? He does! [CHEERING] Great goal, Rod. It's good to have you with us. [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, I brought your ball with me. Hey. We're murdering them. You stupid bastard! I've been busting my ass. What's your problem, hey? It's not my problem, Turner. If I had half the talent you've got, I wouldn't of pissed it out the window like-- That's it, isn't it? You never had any bleeding talent, did ya? You drunk! Right? You've had your chance. After this game, you're out. You're suspended. Do you understand? Yesterday's hero. Right? You can play this [INAUDIBLE] through a concrete box. Two bloody goals don't make you winners. Now get out there and do it! You're going to need more than this at Wembley, I can tell ya that. ANNOUNCER: In the second half, Saints with this two goal lead, still on top. But Hamilton very much in the game on the counter attack. And Jake Marsh, the Saints manager is a little bit worried that his side relaxed too much with Wembley very much in view. And though Rod Turner, number nine, slowed down [INAUDIBLE],, the boys [INAUDIBLE] the penalty area. And it can't be long to go now. The referee's checked his watch. [WHISTLE] [CHEERING] Tremendous finish to the match anyway. What about the second goal? Let him speak. Come on. You made the goal, didn't you, for Rod Turner? And for a word with Rod himself, the goal scorer. What about that second goal? One of your best or what? It went it, didn't it? What about Wembley now then for the final, eh? Do you think you'll win now? How about do a replay. I'll talk you through it. Yeah, OK. The actual replay, just a minute. I've just got to do an interview now with your manage. Jake Marsh is coming in. And Clint Simon, the chairman's coming, I believe. Let's get over there and do manager and the chairman. Any moment now the manager, Jake Marsh is coming with the chairman, Clint Simon. I'll see if I can get a word with them. Just have a word with the successful manager, Jake. Where's your chairman? Clint Simon, he's here as well. Yes. A word with you both, please. Jake, Jake, the manager's who's taking them to Wembley. How do you feel? Elated, but we've still got another match to go, so don't let us get too excited. Now what about Rod Turner's performance? They're saying it was was Turner of 10 years ago. Yeah, well let's not get carried away with individuals. We had a great team today and we're forward to Wembley. Well done. Congratulations. And of course, who else but Clint Simon now, the club chairman. What a day you must be having. - Oh, it's fantastic. I can't believe it. Did it happen? - It actually happened. - Fantastic. How did you feel when the score was only one-nil? Well, I was a little worried, but when Rod stuck the other goal in, I felt-- REPORTER: Boy, I've seen some scenes in dressing rooms before, particularly after semifinals, but I don't think I've ever seen the chairman thrown in the [INAUDIBLE]. That's Clint Simon. We can't get another word with him for the moment. He's absolutely drowned then by the champagne. What a happy dressing room this is, because the Saints, having won two-nil, they've gone to Wembley. If we can just continue our interview now with the Saints' chairman, Clint Simon. Clint, could you just come forward and have a few more words with us please? If I could have a few words with you, chairman. What about this new jacket you brought for the semifinals? Yeah, well it was always a bit big, so-- excuse me, is my tie straight? Excuse me. You were telling me before we got interrupted there about the second goal. - What You were telling me about the second goal. I thought Rod took it brilliantly. It was a brilliant goal, the most fabulous goal I've ever seen! What other celebrations have you got in mind for tonight? The players have decided for you. Now it's off to Wembley, isn't it? To Wembley! JAKE MARSH: So I'm putting him on suspension. I mean, I think you'll agree, Clint, even the great Rod Turner can't get away with boozing during a match. Ah, come on, Jake, he scored, didn't he? Oh, look, he was handed that goal on a plate. My grandmother could have scored it. Look, is it a personal thing with you and Rod? I'm a football manager. The game comes first for me, but I don't like to see talent going to waste, that's all. I don't want to suspend him, Jake. I've built up this team for you, and you hired this man over my objections. Well, if you want him, you have him. But I'll tell you this, Clint, I'm not hanging around here. I don't care how much money you've got. Are your threatening to leave? No, no, I'm not threatening. I'm telling you. It's either him or me. You really are a mean bastard. OK, Jake, suspend him then. But one thing, I just hope you keep on winning, because I've got a mean streak just like you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Look at that. Get over. Come on, Rod. Let's get amongst them. Come on. Hey, come on, let's get down there. The boys are here. I'm first. Wembley! [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE]. So he says, well I think I'll answer the third part last. All right. - Right. Who scored the the goal? How about dancing, eh? Oh, it's so crowded. Well haven't you heard? I can make the crowds. I can surely break them. Oh really? All right. Great. Do you mind? Go right ahead. Come on, my dear. Hello, darling. I know you. You're the gunner. Don't remind me. Oh, can't you remember? I have a terrible memory for faces. Well give her one then, you know. Oh, go back to junior school, sonny. Junior school. Yeah. Junior school. Right. Take care of this, young boy. You want it dry cleaned? Too bad [INAUDIBLE]. Isn't it? All right? [INAUDIBLE] to move through here. Hey. [INAUDIBLE] Listen. Yeah? Why don't you have a word with Clint about Rod. What about? Well, get him dumped off the team. I'm not a messenger. Tell him yourself. You're such a clever girl. You're smart. Who do you think you're pushing? Don't push the lady. Piss off, man. Save that for the boys. I'm not one of them. Yeah, you can say that again. Get him out of here! Get him out. All right, all right. Sorry. Let's continue the dance, shall we? Do you what, Jake? I am so smart, I'm just going to pass on the whole thing. I just don't like you very much. Watch your feet there. All right? - Go back and-- - No! No! - Rod, Rod. Behave yourself. Excuse me, uh, why don't you put Rod in my car and I'll take him home. OK? CLOUDY MARTIN: I put a bath robe on door for you. Yeah. Well, you look all nice and clean. Nice place. Thank you. Do you feel better? I feel like a drink. Want some coffee? Or a large scotch. Oh no. No scotch. After ten years, I want you sober, or at least reasonably so anyway. What is this? Well, let's call it a reunion. Sugar. I've thought about you a lot. You have? Really have. I wondered if you'd even remember it all. Well, you ran off. I ran off? Are you kidding? I ran off? I came back from South America and your girlfriend said you'd gone back to the States. I mean, no message, nothing. I think you're a little mixed up, Rod. I was the one who was supposed to go to South America with you, remember? Hmm? Except you never showed up, and you never called. I called. You did. Well, that's true. That's true, you did call. That's right. It was six months later, but you did call. Well, I mean, I was stupid. Yes. You knew me then. I mean, I just-- well you were different. You're always different. Let's make love, Rod. Is that what you want? What about Clint? We're friends. Oh. I love Clint, I really do. Jake Marsh, he's no fool. If it wasn't for the booze I wouldn't of been dragging yesterday. You mean the drinking keeps you from playing? It did. I guess I just needed a reason to get myself together. Oh, well don't depend on me. I've got a life of my own now, a career. So don't look to me for your support, OK? I mean it. - Come on. - I mean it. - Come on. I mean it. Turner's Palace. Here we are. It's just-- oh. Oh, dear. Bad timing, huh? I spent a sleepless night thinking of you being in hospital or a car crash. I can see I-- Yeah, Susan, this is Cloudy Martin, a very old friend of mine. This is Susan. SUSAN: Yes, yes I know. I've seen the photo, amongst all the others. Now look, Jake Marsh and I, we got into a fight and Cloudy was kind enough to drive-- I mean, I don't have to explain this to you, you know. I mean, we didn't have a date, did we? I spent a whole night waiting for you. You promised you would follow me after the match. I haven't seen you all week. Look-- I think I'll sit this one out, OK. - Well you don't have to. - Yeah, I know. I know. I just have a horrible feeling I know just how she feels. Could I have the keys. Yeah. I think it's about time you gave me my key back, Susan. Certainly. I don't want it anymore. I thought I could help you, but you're finished, you're really finished. Just, uh, give me the key back. You're pathetic! You know that! Nobody takes you seriously. They just all feel sorry for you. Thank you, Susan. A man like you should of retired gracefully years ago. You know what's funny, I never was graceful, you know. Goodbye, Susan. You're disgusting. Ouch. [DOG BARKING] Good game. Good game. Your boy played well, but he's no Dixie Dean. That's what I said. Oh, going back a bit. Yeah. He was lucky. I could of scored that goal with me stick. Oh, give over. It was for five, isn't it? One. The object is for the white ball to hit the blue ball without hitting the red ball. Lisa, a scotch and I'll have an orange juice please. [INAUDIBLE] you drank scotch, compliments of the house. No, you always tempt me, what I'm on orange juice. We'll just have to wait for the champagne after the final then, won't we? - Who's paying for that? Well the governor of course. Who'd you think? Oh, and by the way, if you want anything on the slate, it's OK. Oh. Thank you very much. What, um-- what did you think of the game yesterday? I was impressed. Yeah, you did yourself proud. I didn't. I played better than I have been doing, but that's not saying much, is it? I've got to get really fit for the final. Well, you can do it, if you want to. Well I might surprise you all. Is Marsh giving you a hard time? Well I can take it, but he did catch me at halftime yesterday taking a slug and threatened to suspend me. Thought you said you'd given up the booze. - Today. - Yeah. Today. Have you got those tickets yet? Yeah, I will have-- you, dad, and Marek. It ought to be a treat for the kid. - Yeah, sure. - Never seen a big game. Which reminds me, I've got to make a phone call, Mac. [PHONE RINGING] CLOUDY MARTIN (ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Cloudy Martin. I'm not home right now, but if you'll leave your name and number, I'll call you back. It may take a few months. I travel a lot. You can speak right now. Uh, Cloudy this-- this is Rod. I don't want to talk to a machine, right. Why don't you call me back and let me know what's going on. OK? Right. CLOUDY MARTIN (ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Cloudy Martin. I'm not home right now. MAN (ON TV): Tomorrow morning. On the sports front, the Saints recent acquisition Rod Turner has been put on suspension by the club for an indefinite period. Manager Jake Marsh commented today, "Rod Turner should retire from football. He's out of training and over the hill." Well, strong stuff. the Saints big for the top, and now let's see what's the weather's like. Where were you yesterday? I was home. I called you a couple of times and got the machine. Yeah, I just didn't feel like talking. How come you're ran out of the party so fast on Saturday? Clint, was is this? The third degree? I got tired. I went home. All right? I thought that was all over a long time ago? You know, I don't think it's any of your business. I just want to save you any hassles, that's all. If I want help, I'll ask you, all right? By the way, how come Rod's been suspended? It's not up to me. Jake calls the shots. I can't stand him. He's a very good manager. He's a creep. [DOORBELL] LINDA (ON PHONE): Mr. Rod Turner is here. He insists on seeing you. OK OK, Linda. I want you to send him in. OK, Linda. Send him in. What's all this suspension shit? It's your own fault, Rod. There's nothing I can do about it. Oh, my fault? I played, didn't I? I scored. CLINT SIMON: You scored, but according to Jake, he caught you boozing at halftime. Now you know as well as I do, we can't let you get away with it. Now look, you're the one that brought me over here to play. You made a great speech about how wonderful everything was going to be. I told you I had a great job lined up in America, but you were very persuasive, so I agreed to come and play here, even though I knew there'd be trouble with Marsh. Look, I'm very delighted that you came. Oh, you're delighted. Imagine how I feel. I mean with Marsh on my back the whole time, pricking me, pushing me, prodding me, newspapers needling me, now the suspension. Listen, you've got me into this, now I want to play in that final. It is my fault, but I'll apologize to Marsh. I'll talk to Jake, Rod. I'll see what I can do. I can't promise anything, you must understand that. But, uh, I'll do what I can. And yes it would be nice to think the Saints aren't just another expensive toy. Are you going to put him back on the team? What do you care if he plays or not? I didn't say that I cared. I'd just like you to fix it. Please? CLOUDY MARTIN (ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Cloudy Martin. Thank you. Did you have a word with Clint about getting rid of Rod? Jake, I can't seem to get through to your brain. I am not a direct line to Clint. And even if I was, you are the last person that I would deliver messages for. I'm sorry, I'll just thought that you-- I don't care what you thought. Why don't you just leave Rod alone? You got him suspended, isn't that good enough for you? Uh, I'm going to go home, OK? Well, OK, babe. What's the hurry? Ah, I'm just not in the mood for company. All right, I'll come with you. Any company. They never say I don't get the message. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye bye. ROD TURNER: Hello. If you think you're getting another cup of coffee, forget it. What is this game? What game? Listen, what is it with you? What? I've had a few drinks, all right? Yeah, well I thought you're going to quit. I can quit any time I want to, but right now I want you, are right? Oh, I don't want you. Look, I want you. Listen, I want to tell you something. This could have worked out a few years. - Oh, no, no. - Yes. You didn't want it to happen then, and I don't want it to happen now. Now I'm ready for it. Now I can handle it. I don't believe it. You can't even handle your own life. Now let's just say goodbye nicely and let it all be over with. - I don't want to. Yes. I don't want to. I do. Cloudy! Rod? Hello, dad. Out of time What's going on, Son? The papers say you've been suspended. You're off to the final, aren't ya? Yeah. It'll be all right. - Cheers, Sam. - Thanks, Rita. Cheers, Dad. Thanks, Rod. Is he going to be playing then? Yeah. Yep. Go on, he'll never get to the final. I told you he was too old, didn't I? Why don't you leave him alone. Rod will be playing. You'll see. You'll all see. Yeah, he'll get to Wembley all right, cleaning the shit house. Hey, Rod? What? One easy. What happened to me credit? You know the boss. Change of books. Thank you, Rita. Sorry. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Good afternoon, Susan. SUSAN: Good afternoon. [CHEERING] Where's Marek? SUSAN: He's not feeling too well. ROD TURNER: What's the matter with him? I didn't want to come, Rod. Says you've been telling them stories. What? NUN: Take no notice, Mr. Turner. Marek's a little upset. I think he's disappointed that you're on suspension. ROD TURNER: Can I see him? Well, I think better we should just leave him alone. He was looking forward to your playing in the final. I will be playing in the final, and I've got a ticket for him. Tell him I won't let him down. OK? If you're sure, Mr. Turner. Oh I'm bloody sure. Mr. Turner. Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. I'm sorry. Tell him it'll be all right. It'll be all right. Come on! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, mate. You're an early bird. ROD TURNER: Yeah. Did you, uh, leave those extra [INAUDIBLE]?? Yeah, I left 'em. Give us an pint then. Yeah, here you go. Yeah, best of luck with the Saints, eh? Yeah. Cheers, Tom. - Right-o Harry. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good luck, Rod. Rise. Lower. We're 25 minutes into it. Rise. Hold it there. Lower. Hold. Raise. Lower. Rest. Hey. What are you doing here? Back in training, ain't I? Ah, that's great, mate. I was beginning to think that we'd see the last of you around these parts. I wouldn't give him the pleasure. Right on. Well, look what we've got here then. A fully paid up member of the geriatrics club. Your presence isn't required around here, Turner. You're still on suspension, you know. Well, we old folks gotta try to keep up with the younger generation, sir. Try to keep in shape, you know. Hello, Stockholm. [MUSIC PLAYING] CLINT AND CLOUDY (SINGING): CLINT AND CLOUDY (SINGING): Every time we're moving together, I get the same old feeling, yeah. For two people in love with one another, we treat each other like we just don't care. That's not what we came here for. There's still time to love one another. And that's not what we came here for.

BUTCH: I wish you were playing Saturday. We could use your experience. Don't worry, Butch. Nothing you can do about it. You coming to the dinner tonight? No. Nah, it's not my scene. Clint will be there. It gets back to them. Maybe you could talk to him. I don't beg. He knows. Anyway, I've pushed myself these last few weeks, which is more important than 90 minutes of glory. ANNOUNCER (TV): Now, the latest on the Cup final build-up. the Saints-- Clint Simon's amazing giant killers will be pitting their considerable skills against first division Lester Forrest, and it promises to be quite some final. Ginger Jeston, 25-year-old star striker is in top form and has so far scored 17 goals in their incredible path to the top. Will Rob Turner, former star striker be allowed to play? Manager Jake Marsh is not saying. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi. Hello, Cloudy. What do you want? Um, listen, uh, why don't I come over? I think maybe we should talk. Uh, Cloudy, what do you want from me? If you wanted to get your home back, you did. OK? Now we're even. Getting dumped twice, I don't need. Well, I'm leaving for Los Angeles Saturday after the game. I don't think that I'll be coming back. I just wanted to say goodbye. So say it. OK. If that's the way you want it. Goodbye. Goodbye, Cloudy. Get your program here. Get your program. Get your programs here. This takes you back, doesn't it, sir? It must be 10 years or more. 10 years you're right. Rod scored two goals in the first half. What about the second half? He got his hat trick. That's right. One more. Bet you've never seen this many people before, have ya? Never. Here you go. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simon. Is it possible to have a few words with you? Yeah, sure. Um. Can we just get up here? OK. Fine. Can I one of Rod? Of course you can. Of course you can. One. Well how do you feel about the Saints playing at Wembley today? It's just fantastic. I'm over the moon about it. So Clint and Cloudy, how do you feel about having the number one hit together? Pretty good. Pretty good. This is the third time that you've had a number one in England, with a single hit. Yeah, that's right. Is that all you've got to say about it? That's nice? Well, no. I mean, if you want to talk about football, I'll talk about it all day. I don't care. - Can I just ask you something? - Yeah, sure. Is it true that you and Clint are back on plans to make it more than just a record relationship? The only plans that we've got are to win the Cup. Yeah! What a crowd. It's so wonderful. [HORNS] [KNOCKING] Two minutes, Mr. Marsh. All right. JOHN MARKS (TV): This is your max commentator, John Marks, reporting from inside the empire stadium, Wembley on Cup Final Day. All the color and pageantry of this great occasion being enjoyed by these supporters. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. JOHN MARKS (TV): A historic moment, this, because Saints are the first third division team ever to reach the FA Cup Final at Wembley. They're making history today, against First Division opponents in Lester Forrest. [CHEERING] Jake Marsh, the manager takes his seat on the bench. And alongside him, Armstrong is there. Rod Turner, the surprise choice as substitute for the Saints. But it's Lester Forrest in the white shorts. They'll get the FA Cup Final underway here, playing from right to left. Pitch will probably be fairly heavy. Saints wearing the yellow shirts and blue shorts. That was Butch Jackson trying to get down the line, but he was beaten by left back-- [CHEERING] Here's [INAUDIBLE] trouble, the number 11 Tony Parker on the Lester Forrest side. Forrest moving quite nicely with Dean-- tries to find Ellis and headed away at the far post by Jim Davis for a corner. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Dangerous moment here for the Saints. One in the air there by Tommy Smithson for Forrest. There's Griffin. Ooh, a mistake by the goalkeeper that was knocked away. Corner then to Lester Forrest. The ball headed out by Paul Jenkins for Saints. Now going to get moving now through Walford, number four. Lewis is in the attack as well. So is Frye. Saints with plenty of players forward. Jimmy Chalmers tries to get in. That's a post ding there. Good goalkeeping though. Oh, here's a Jack on the run. And if it is through-- goal! Oh, bloody hell. JOHN MARKS (TV): It's given Lester Forrest the lead in the final with 15 minutes gone. So Saints now have got to come from behind. What a task for the third division side. Oh, no. Come on. JOHN MARKS (TV): Strong tackling is happening at Wembley this afternoon. But here's a dangerous moment. It's Parker. Oh, there's Griffin in the area again. [CHEERING] He should of got rid of it. JOHN MARKS (TV): And with half an hour gone, Lester Forrest leads Saints by two goals to nil. Well, the third division team had a tough chance to start with here, but to give away two goals like that, that's giving them a mountain now to climb. Move it! Move it, will ya? JOHN MARKS (TV): That's going to be a throw-in to Saints as Jeston tried again to get past Branston. Two-nil then. Four minutes left in the first half. Walton-- three players waiting in the center for Saints. It's a useful cross. Not really clear. Thomas with the shot-- [CHEERING] Saints are back in the match. Oh, that was a superb volley by Duke Thomas. And the Saints fans now, their turn to celebrate. [WHISTLE] Just coming up to halftime. That's an awkward ball, headed away by Rob Collar of the Saints. [WHISTLE] And the halftime whistle, as Saints go in, 2-1 down, but it could of been so much worse. They pulled themselves round there when the match was running away from them. And at halftime, it's 2-1 to Lester Forrest. All right, lads, come on. Come on. Pay attention. Now, look, we're a goal down and you're feeling sick. You played bloody well the first half. We're going to win this match. Believe me, we're going to win this match. All right? Now come on. It's been a long, hard road getting here. Now get out there and enjoy it. Relax! Look, I'll tell you what I want you to do. I want you to walk out of this dressing room, walk up that tunnel, walk onto the pitch with your heads held up high, and when he blows that whistle start running. I want you to run, and I don't want you to stop running until you run back in here with that cup. [CHEERING] JOHN MARKS (TV): As the teams come out for the second half of the final, the question that's been asked by many of the Saints supporters, and certainly we're asking it here in the commentary box is whether or not Rod Turner might come on and substitute in the second half. Jake Marsh has that option. He's got him on the bench. Turner scored in the semifinal. And the fans are giving the players a marvelous reception as they come out for the second half. And Saints playing now from the right, get the match going again. And that's Branston now in the attack. Hard tackling in this match. Branston caught one there right on the shin bone. Free kick taken quickly by Parker. Green is in there. There's number seven. Can he pull it back? One saved by keeper. Oh! [INAUDIBLE] That would of been a hat trick for Griffin if it has gone in. Bring it down! JOHN MARKS (TV): And here they are on the attack. That's a good chance in for Thomas. Oh, a good goalkeeping too by Dubner. And a back tackle from behind there. Warm up, Turner. JOHN MARKS (TV): The players are still arguing. The yellow card's been shown to Tony Keys, and rightly so in my view. It was a terrible tackle. You come on to the left and you push well up. JOHN MARKS (TV): There's going to have to be a substitution. I told you son, didn't I? Come on, Rod. JOHN MARKS (TV): He's come on to substitute for the Saints, who are 2-1 down with eight minutes to go. Turner, wearing number 12, but looking very assured we came on. And here's a breakdown by Saints-- a good break too, plenty of players forward, including Lewis Thomas and Frye. Turner's in there again. That's a nice move. Frye goes over the ball. It's Turner. It's a goal! It's a goal by Rod Turner! [CHEERING] And Wembley in absolute uproar here. The Saints supporters celebrating, and why not. Rod Turner, the substitute has pulled the Cup Final around. Now then, we must surely have extra time, maybe even a replay. With the score 2-2, and the time ticking away now on the clock with barely 30 seconds left. But here's Turner. He's forward again. [WHISTLE] And the referee-- Penalty kick! JOHN MARKS (TV): Penalty. And this is an amazing moment. The time now is over the 90 minutes. We're in injury time, as Rod Turner places the ball for a penalty. What a tense moment this is. Easy, Son. JOHN MARKS (TV): Turner looks very cool and collected. Come on, Rod. [WHISTLE] I can't watch. JOHN MARKS (TV): It's in the net! [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
