The focus of this operation is to have him continue to breathe on his own. - This is just getting worse and worse. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean breathing on my own? - Well there's a second tumor on your other vocal cord. It's very small and it doesn't seem to pose a threat right now. - Well can't you remove that one too? - You should let that one alone for now. I wanna keep an eye on it. If for any reason we should need to remove that one as well, it may effect breathing. - And what if that gets worse? - We'll remove it.

We love you! - Where are they? What's taking them so long? - They took off out the east exit. - What? I told them the south. - Kat, where are you going? - I'm going off to see where they are. - Limo was waiting, they're long gone. - You're kidding. Did you not see how sick TJ was? - I didn't, sorry. - I'm calling him. - It might've been the biggest audience we've ever played for. It was a sold out show. They were all there to see you. You belong on that stage. - Well they were there to see you too. Are you okay? TJ? TJ are you okay? No? - I know the timing couldn't be any worse, but you need to be in Seattle in six hours. You were supposed to be on the plane already. - I can't just leave him. - I know love, I know, but we can't cancel. We can't cancel a show now, can we? And he's got the best possible team working on him. I just spoke to the surgeon. - She's right, you go, okay? I'll stay here with him. - Thanks Hank. There's not much you can do at this point is there? And I will have him back in 12 hours, I promise. - Okay. - All right, love, thank you. You'll call if you hear anything, won't you? - Yes I will. As soon as I hear. - Come on darling. - Thank you. - TJ is a fighter, he's gonna be okay. Come here. - Good evening Seattle! You all look lovely tonight. Some of you may already have heard, but my husband TJ Millhouse was rushed to surgery last night. We heard on the radio coming here, the DJ asking you to bring your hearts tonight in support of him. So tonight, I'm dedicating this song to him.

He's got his whole life ahead of him yet. I love you. That other tumor in TJ's throat finally got a hold of him. The doctor said they removed what they could, and that we should just pray for the best. We all took turns checking in on him. - Morning, I made you all some breakfast. Come on over here and have a seat. - Thank you. - It's about the only meal that I make that I don't usually screw up. I know you're not hungry and all, but you do need to eat. It is the Millhouse rule. Prayers. Dear Lord, we thank you for this wonderful food and our special family, precious as they are. - He's gonna be all right Hank. I can feel it. - Would you mind if I referred to you as my daughter? - I would like that very much. - Good. Dig in. Days went by and I decided to plant some flowers out front, hoping to pass the time. You planting flowers? - TJ? You're awake! What happened to your breathing tube? - I'm fine, I don't need it. Never realized how long of a walk it was to the backyard though. - I think something's going on here. - We're having a baby? - I think so. - Oh. How do you know? - I just do.
