(AUDIENCE CHEERING) Hi. I'm Ben Creed and I'll be your host this evening. I'm more or less the parole officer for these renegade, outcast comedians. They're considered renegades because most people think that their acts are too dirty. Well, "dirty" is a very relative term. Some of the same people that point their fingers at these guys and call them dirty will then go home and light their own farts on fire (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) and giggle like wild rabid squirrels. Or maybe they'll just look at their dog and get a boner. You know, a man once said, "A true professional comedian always works clean. "It's too easy to rely on the dirty words or the blue material to get a laugh." But that guy was a fucking douche bag with a very small dick. If I ever see him, I'm gonna rip that small dick off, load it into a crossbow, and shoot it through his mother's heart. These guys are not dirty. They're simply performers that have something to say, and they say it the way that it should be said. So sit back, relax, and enjoy these funny motherfuckers. First up tonight is a gentleman from Los Angeles, California, who someday, I'm sure, will climb into a bell tower with a rifle and hunt for Ruth Buzzi. He's also the only man that Gandhi ever kicked in the nuts. Please welcome the very scary Monty Hoffman. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. AUDIENCE: (CHANTING) Monty! Monty! All right, how you doing? This is great to be here. I had a pretty shitty day today. I was walking down the street, this little kid stops me and goes, "Hey, are you the guy from the Operation game?" (SCOFFS) "No, I'm a fucking ninja." I had to stop drinking. I remember the last time I got real drunk, I came home, I abused my wife and kids. MAN: Yeah! Then I realized I was in the wrong apartment. And I'm single. I've got something every man wants, tits. (LAUGHING) This is great. I had a relationship goin' on. I had this woman live with me for 14 days. Then she chewed through the ropes and got free. I like kinky women, myself. Any girls out there kinky? AUDIENCE: Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, okay, Olga. All right. (SCOFFS) Most women like to talk dirty to me in bed. "Get off me, ya fat bastard!" "Aw, baby, I didn't know you were sleeping." She's always complaining, "All you like is sex and bowling." "So? What's wrong with bowling?" It's gonna be in the '88 Olympics. Did you hear about this? Yeah, for the first time, they're gonna try bowling. I mean, just think about it, folks. Some guy that looks like me could win a fucking gold medal. (AUDIENCE WHOOPING) Yeah. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (CHUCKLES) I mean, can you see some guy working out for the Olympics? (HUMMING GONNA FLY NOW) (IMITATES CAN OPENING) Yeah. (SCOFFS) This is great being back home in New York. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) I was with my brother. I was driving... Yeah. Right over here. I was driving around Brooklyn, right? I get into this accident. So I bring the car to an auto body shop. I ask the guy for a rough estimate, so he kicks me in the nuts and goes, "4.50." Oh, yeah. How do you pass that on to the insurance guy? (CHUCKLES) "Here, it's in your hands now." I know you women are looking at me thinking, "What a hunka hunka burnin' love." Lot of people say I look like Elvis. (AUDIENCE WHOOPING) (CHUCKLES) Yeah. About three... Yeah. Yeah, right. About three hours before his death. I was in Portland, Oregon, you know. Dig this, man. I was in Portland, Oregon. I went to the state fair. I was hanging out at one of these booths having a piece of corn. This guy comes over and puts a blue ribbon around my neck. I don't care I'm fat. I know in two years from now I'm gonna be a sex god. That's right, all you girls are gonna go, "Hey, there's a fat one. He ain't got AIDS. Get him." (CHUCKLES) Right? Huh? Thank God for the fat guy! ♪ Well, LL Cool J got nothin' on me ♪ 'Cause I got that certain personality (AUDIENCE CLAPPING IN TIME) ♪ Hip, hop, hippity-hop ♪ We all go to the barbershop ♪ Walk in there, I sit on the chair ♪ Barber laughs, "You ain't got no hair" ♪ I said, "Mmm, that's so cold" ♪ Says, "Mmm, God bless my soul" ♪ Lots of love I start to strut ♪ Come to a place called Supercuts ♪ Shave the side, shave the back ♪ I want to look like my man Kojak ♪ Said, "Hmm, who loves ya, baby?" ♪ Said, "Hmm, who loves ya, baby?" ♪ Well, I might be fat but I ain't no chump ♪ People say I look like a big speed bump ♪ Said, "Please don't clap while I'm up here rhymin' ♪ "Don't you know it throws off my timin'?" ♪ Ow! Thank you. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) MAN: Yeah! Yeah. I just wanted to... You know, it's strange, 'cause my life is getting so together right now because I gave up cocaine, ladies and gentlemen. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It feels good to sleep after three years. Fuck. I know you're lookin' at me goin', "Boy, this guy did coke for three years? "What was it covered with, butter?" Fuck. I can remember nights in my apartment when I'm by myself, snortin' lines this fuckin' big, going, (SNIFFING) "Who the fuck's out there?" (LAUGHS MENACINGLY) Me and my friends, man, we'd go out, we'd get a half a gram, then it'd go to a gram, then an eight ball. I mean, eventually, they named a village in Peru after me. Hey, there's some guy walkin' around, "We'd like to thank Monty Hoffman for this new church. "We'd like to thank Monty Hoffman for this new hospital." You know? There'd be a statue of me in the main square like this. Fuck that shit. I remember people coming up to me goin', "Hey, you got five minutes to do a quick line?" And you go back with these people, it takes 'em like an hour and a half to prepare the stuff. It's like rent-a-friend. They're like, "Oh, look, Frosty the Snowman." You know, to make the lines, they got their ruler to measure each line. Protractor comes out. You do up the lines, you pass on the mirror, everybody gets high and then what happens? The next batch comes out. Things speed up. Doesn't take an hour and a half. Takes like 30 seconds. And it sounds like a circus going on the mirror. Remember the Sabre song? (HUMMING SABRE DANCE) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) I'm Monty Hoffman! Monty Hoffman! Give him a nice hand. Monty Hoffman. Give it up for him. Give it up. Monty Hoffman. And you thought my hair was fucked up, huh? (MAN SHOUTING) Hey, wait. I know you. You're an actress. I saw your film last night. You were very good. I didn't get to see the end, though, 'cause I ran out of quarters, but, you know... Just a little joke. I was just kidding. I had plenty of quarters. I saw the whole thing. It was just a little joke. Hey, was that a Mastiff or a Great Dane? Anyway, coming up next to the stage, ladies and gentlemen, is a young performer, 21 years old. He's from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. He's... (AUDIENCE CHEERING) What are you, his fucking roommate or something? From Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, the Nat Turner of comedy, Mr. Chris Rock! So what's up? (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (WOMAN SHOUTING) So I hate life. WOMAN 1: Oh. WOMAN 2: Yeah. Can't stand life. You know why? AUDIENCE: Why? 'Cause I was born a suspect. Born a suspect. Came out my mother's stomach, anything that happened in a three block radius, I was a suspect. White America is so scared of black teenagers, I walk down the streets, the women are grabbin' hold of their mace, everybody's tucking in their chains and people are hitting their car doors, people get into karate stances. I look up in the air, there's a bunch of old white ladies. They'll get on the phone. They'll dial 9-1 and just wait for me to do something. So I'm 21, I live at home. It's not that bad, though, 'cause I have friends that are like 28 and live at home. That's pathetic. A 28-year-old man that lives at home. There's only thing worse than a 28-year-old man that lives at home, and that's any woman willing to sneak into his room. Now, I live at home, right, and my mother likes to clean up my room, and whenever my mother cleans up my room, she always takes out all my dirty magazines. Whenever your mother takes your dirty magazines, you can't say anything about it. Okay, she don't say nothing, you don't say nothing. Now, I'm sitting down eating breakfast with my mother. There's a tension at the table 'cause I'm not like her little baby anymore, I'm like some pervert she's given birth to. So I sit down at the table, me and Mom, Mom and me. I'm sittin' there, so I try to break the tension. It's like, "Ma, have you seen my baseball glove?" And Mother goes, "Well, why don't you check The Penthouse?" Sometimes, you don't find that your mother took your book till it's too late. It's like 3:00 in the morning, you're ready to jerk off and there's no book. So you have to search the whole house for any picture with a woman on it, and finally you settle for Aunt Jemima. You got that box of Aunt Jemima, and she's looking at you, and you're looking at her, and your imagination starts going. Aunt Jemima starts looking real good. Takes that rag off her head, hits the ground. Big fat ass, big buttermilk breasts hanging... In phase two, Aunt Jemima starts talking dirty to you. You start hearing this fat black lady's voice like, "Come on, baby. Let your auntie suck it now. Come on, now. "Come on, babe, put some syrup on that bad boy. Come on, now. "Come on, now. Spread them cheeks, honey. "This your auntie talking. Come on, now." And right before you come, Uncle Ben gets off his box. "Hey, leave her alone, that's my bitch." So, Jesse Jackson's running for president. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (MAN BOOING) Running for president. I don't know, I always thought the media in this country was very liberal till Jesse Jackson ran for president. Then I found out how racist they are, 'cause about a month ago, Jesse Jackson was in the lead, in the lead of all the Democratic candidates. On the cover of every magazine in the country it said, "What does Jesse want?" Say, I think he wants to be the fucking president, okay? I mean, is there a janitor's job open up in the White House I didn't hear about? "What does Jesse..." Like a black man can't even want to be president? Like some genie comes out of the sky, "Jesse, I'll grant you three wishes." "I wish to be president." "Please pick something else." "What does Jesse want," man? Come on, man. Crazy, crazy, crazy. I don't want to deceive you. The reason Jesse didn't win, 'cause no Jewish people would vote for Jesse, which left rednecks very confused. Rednecks didn't know what to do, man. Rednecks were walkin' around, "All my life I wanted to vote for a Jew-hater. "Turns out to be a nigger." See, they had a plot to kill Jesse. A plot to kill him. He's losing by a landslide, and that's too close for some people. Scared he might become the first black man not to be president. Rednecks confused again. On one hand, they want him dead, and on the other hand, they don't want to celebrate that holiday. They would've never made his birthday a... Martin Luther King's having a hard enough time as it is, and he actually did something, okay? And further, in Alabama, Martin Luther King's birthday is not a holiday. Why is it not a holiday? 'Cause he's black, that's why his birthday's not a holiday. It's 'cause if this was Elvis, it would be a fuckin' holiday, okay? It'd be like... It'd be like a second Christmas, okay? Like big fat white guys coming down chimneys with Elvis jumpsuits on, giving out Quaaludes, and a black man can't have a holiday. And some people have the nerve, the fucking nerve, to compare Elvis Presley with Martin Luther King. Man, how do you do that, man? It's like, "I have a dream," "I have a hound dog." You think about it real hard, they should just give Martin Luther King somebody else's holiday, 'cause there's so many stupid bullshit holidays we celebrate every year, like Columbus Day. Nobody celebrates Columbus Day. Nobody puts like three ships in their front yard. But it's a holiday, okay? First of all, Columbus discovered the West Indies, okay? Number two, the land he discovered had occupants on it. You know, that's kind of like discovering somebody's backyard, okay? So you think about all Columbus actually did was discover a West Indian backyard. He got there, it was like, "Hey, hey, hey, hey! "I claim this land for fucking Spain." (IN WEST INDIAN ACCENT) "Hey, mon, get yer damn flag out me roses now. "What the hell is wrong with you now? I kill ya, boy." So, guys, remember the first time you ever had your finger inside a girl? And you walked home for like eight blocks smelling that finger. Then you walk over to your best friend. "Sharon." (CHUCKLES) Oh, man. So I was in South Africa the other day. Or was it Boston? Yeah, I gotta go. Give it up! Chris Rock! Chris Rock, man. Give it up for him. Chris Rock. Can I tell you something? MAN: Yeah. The other day, I was eating this girl out, and, uh, I guess I got carried away, 'cause I didn't stop till her head caved in. No, no. Keep your seats. There's more. Right now, I'm very proud to present this next performer, because he does not use a guitar in his act. (WOMAN WHOOPING) He lives in Los Angeles, California, on a hill. He has no car insurance, and his name is Larry Scarano. Give it up for him. Come on! All right. Yeah. MAN: Yeah! Thanks a lot. Glad you like it, man. Saw my all-time favorite Enquirer headline last month. Said, "Two-Headed Woman Gives Birth." You figure this guy would have just settled for a blow job. Some guys want everything, you know? First date, too. How you guys doing? Saturday night, got your rubbers on? MAN 1: Yeah! They want to put rubber machines in high schools. You believe this, man? MAN 2: Yeah! Aw, get out. When we were growing up, at least they kept them in the bars. Remember those yellow machines, had pictures of sleazy chicks on 'em with whips and garter belts and bras and high heels with flames coming out the side? Now they got pictures of skinny guys dying. It's a jungle out there, kids. I think doctors made up AIDS at the last convention, man. Keep their fucking jobs, you know what I mean? Sit around, "What the hell are we gonna do? Cancer's falling in the ratings." "I don't know, we'll think of something. You'll love it, it's a killer." Kick it off with a celebrity endorsement right there out in the front, put it in three groups in the country, Haitians... Haitians, gay guys and junkies. Don't invite me to that fucking party. (SCOFFS) What the hell happened to herpes, man? It like bombed or something, didn't it? It's like a flop or something. Yeah, herpes. Sounds like cooties with an attitude. The 8-track of disease, herpes. Got any homeless people here tonight? AUDIENCE: Yeah! How does it feel to be out of the box? Pretty good, huh? Are they a pain in the ass or what? Sleeping on the side of the road at 9:30 at night like they gotta get up tomorrow and do something. (SCOFFING) Stay up late, have a party, what the fuck? Comic relief. I do my part. Every time I see a bagman sleeping, I honk the horn. "Wake up, you lazy fuck." The homeless. Nice name. How come they don't call 'em the lazy bums? (SCOFFS) You guys getting ready to vote? Yeah, like they count 'em, right? Yeah, Democrats are having a hell of a time. Why don't they just go nuts and nominate like two of the Ramones, get it over with? Fuck. Think they got a secret weapon. You're gonna see 'em like November 2nd show up with John F. Kennedy, all tan and ready to kick ass. "How you doing? I was at the Bahamas the whole time. "Me and Ed Sullivan made it up to piss off The Beatles, that's all. "How do I look in color, kids? "This is my brother, Bobby. He's got Ed Meese's gig. "This is Marilyn. She's doing good. (IMITATES HONKING) "I had to bring her. She's been bitching about Madonna for two years here." Madonna. Man, did you see her in Playboy last year? MAN: Yeah! God, she got some serious growth on her, that girl. (EXCLAIMS) Hairy armpits. First time I saw those pictures, I didn't know which way to hold the magazine. What the fuck is this? It's a dream date, that's all. I don't know. I'm showing up with two pals on this one. Hey, somebody gets the pot of gold, you know what I mean? MAN: Yeah! (LAUGHING) How's Oliver North? Man, I'm following North. I think they're gonna hang him from the highest tree, old Ollie. They ought to give him a break, man. I think he's a hell of a director. I really liked Platoon. Who sold contraceptives to Iran? Who gives a shit? The slickest guy in that whole thing was the head of the CIA, Casey. They day they indicted him, he goes, "I'm dead, fuck you. "Close the door behind me, too." Noriega, there's another poor guy, man. They wanted to get his job, they put coke in his luggage. Coke's the new communism, isn't it? Anytime they want to bust somebody's balls, they blame it on coke. Northwest Airlines crashed this rickety-ass old metal stress plane last year. Didn't tell you it was a '65 Mustang with bald tires, you know. Nah, nah, the maintenance guy was high on coke. That's why the plane crashed. This guy's whole gig in life was to get up in the morning, eat his Wheaties and check wing flaps all day. One day, he gets up, does a line of coke. "Fuck a bunch of wing flaps." (SCOFFING) We need some hippies, man. Goddamn... WOMAN: Yeah! Yeah, where are they when we need 'em? MAN: Yeah! Fuck. Where the hell's Hendrix when we need him? There's a guy who knew when to leave the planet, huh? Hendrix left the planet. Barry Manilow got a hit record, he said, "I gotta go." Need some acid. Anybody trip on acid? WOMAN: Yeah. How many times there, twice? Remember this shit? Two times. You got any kids? How they doing? All right? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) They were worried about the acid babies, man. They didn't know how the hell they were gonna behave. They watched that generation real close. About two years ago, a bunch of 14 year olds flipped over, started spinning on their heads. "Holy shit, the acid babies are here. "Oh, fuck." They didn't call 'em acid babies, they call 'em break dancers, but we know the truth. Fucking autism. (SCOFFS) Cure for autism, two reefers and a drum set. Now we got the yuppies, man. I love the yuppies. You guys took every chemical in the world in the '60s. Same guy now bitching about preservatives in potato chips. (SCOFFS) Yeah. Nothing survived hippiedom, man. Everything's gone. Ideals... The only thing left is good old pot. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (MAN SHOUTING) Yeah, you like pot, huh? You like pot. Not as much as the plastic sandwich bag companies like it, man. They know that... What the hell do they think is going on, man? There's some fuckin' sandwich glut in America or something? Selling pot in those bags, man. Well, I gotta go. I'm parked in a handicapped space with a ski rack on my car. Think I'm done. Thank you. Larry Scarano, the Ratso Rizzo of comedy. Give him a nice hand. Give it up for him. Folks, fuck off. Right now we've got coming to the stage a young lady who is not only anatomically correct, but I don't think that she'd let the opportunity to use a loaded handgun go unrealized. Please welcome Stephanie Hodge! How you doin'? I'm smoking. I'm that way. There's probably a lot of non-smokers here. You people are grinding my ass to a bloody stub, man. You are. I know it pisses you off when we smoke in public. I just don't care. I'm gonna start... (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Yeah, man, all right. We're tougher than them anyway, aren't we? We don't need little things like oxygen to pull our ass through a day, pal. I'm gonna start caring when you guys get rid of the shit that makes me sick in public, things like fat guys with their butt cracks hanging out of their pants. I'm not talking cleavage. You know what I'm talking. I'm talking very serious butt crack canyon. You know, that kind of thing where if you're sitting behind it and you just happen to have an envelope in your hand. And you know somehow, someday, that's gonna make it to Missouri. You know that's right. Man, if you smoke, too, be careful what you smoke. Don't smoke lights. You're just sucking twice as hard for half as much, and God knows there's no sense in that. I smoke a real cigarette. I smoke non-filter Lucky Strikes. Not a lot of us left. Most of us are dead. Course, that leaves more cigarettes for me, so I really don't give a rat's ass. I don't even like these, man. I smoke 'em for the old ad. You remember that? "So round, so firm, so fully packed. "So free yet (INHALES DEEPLY) "easy on the draw." Man, if that don't make you smoke, nothing will. I'm having me a cocktail, too. "Cocktail." There's a stupid fuckin' word for ya. Cocktail. Sure. Bring me a cocktail. I'll suck on a cocktail all night long! Christ, that's offensive. You might as well just call 'em vicar's butts, you know what I mean? I always drink vodka, 'cause no matter how drunk you get, you can always order. (DRUNKENLY) "Vodka!" (EXHALING) That's how I like to drink. It's more fun. MAN 1: Yeah! MAN 2: Yeah! (EXHALING) Man, I love doin' that when I'm home alone feeling kind of butch, you know what I mean? Now, you're lookin' at me like I'm a sixth grade lesbian gym teacher, for Christ's sake. I'm not a dyke, I'm not even a small bridge. Just relax, man. (EXHALING) My grandmother taught me to drink that way. She's 98 years old. Scares the shit out of me every time she does that. Her age, you're never real sure when that (EXHALING) is gonna turn into... (CHOKING) Jesus Christ, I'm telling you this much, I got a fantasy I gotta live out this year. This is my goal. I have a sexual fantasy. I want Pee-wee Herman. Oh, man, I want him bad. 'Cause you know that's his real personality, and you know anybody with a personality like that, they gotta have something to compensate for it, you know what I mean? I'm just praying it's a dick like a baseball bat. Come on, man. If anybody's gonna have one of those things, give it to Pee. He'd be so cute. Just one leg, the other pant leg all filled up with a big old penile unit. (GRUNTS) Come on, that'd explain why his hair sticks straight up in front the way it does, wouldn't it? Explain that walk he does and that stupid noise he makes. (SCREAMING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Man, you know there's not a man in here wouldn't holler like that if y'all could step on your own. Come to think of it, there's not a woman in here wouldn't holler like that if you could, either. Can you imagine Pee-wee Herman making love to a woman? I am. Yeah, I imagined it. Now you have to. I can't bear this burden alone any longer. Jesus Christ, man. He wouldn't even take his clothes off. He'd leave that red tie on and those big white shoes. Moment of climax, he'd look at her, (IMITATING PEE-WEE HERMAN) "I know you are, but what am I?" I'm out of here, good night. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Stephanie Hodge. How about it, folks? You like her? Too bad she's got a dick. Coming up next is a man from Los Angeles, California, and his motto is, "Give me pussy or give me pussy." How about a nice hand for Mr. John Fox. Two firemen are butt-fucking in a smoke-filled room. The chief comes in, says, "What are you guys doin'?" He said, "Sir, this man's got smoke inhalation." He said, "Well, give him mouth-to-mouth." He says, "I did. How do you think this shit got started?" So how many people think I look like Captain Kangaroo after a rough weekend, huh? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Well, you're a sensitive group of fuckers, I'll tell you that. Breaking up with my girlfriend this week. We're at the stage of the relationship where you know it's over, but you hate to lose that stereo. She's not that bright. She called me up yesterday. She said, "John, the light bulb in the bathroom burned out "and I don't know how to change it." Said, "First, you fill the tub with water." Someone's taking a piss on me right here, I think. She's got these press-on nails. She wears press-on nails. I like press-on nails, but they're a bitch pulling outta your asshole in the morning, aren't they, guys? Huh? She likes to go to porno movies. You people go to porno movies? Got to be 18 or accompanied by a trench coat to get into these things. She took me to this one, it was three-dimensional. Three-dimensional pornographic movie. I sat too close to the screen. (CHUCKLES) Some guy had an orgasm, it was like, "Duck! "I'm taking these glasses off, man. "You can have all the popcorn. I don't want this shit." But I'm watching this pornographic movie, I notice the guy in front of me sitting next to an inflatable doll. I was thoroughly disgusted. I could not believe a man would bring an inflatable doll to a pornographic film. (CHUCKLES) And I grabbed my sheep and I said, "Honey, "let's get the flock outta here. (BAAING) "This is a bad movie. I'm not gonna watch this." Lot of motels offer rated X movies. Now, motels, they call it closed-circuit TV, which is a title that scares me. It should scare you folks, too. I'll tell you why. Like if I'm watching a movie in Room 6, how do I know that I'm not the movie in Room 7? Wouldn't that be embarrassing? The next day in the parking lot, "Hey, aren't you Bronco Bob? "How'd you get that lamp up your ass so fast? "It was a miracle. I swear to God, it was a fucking miracle." I'd like to meet the person who writes pornographic movies. Now, there's a sick individual. How do you write a pornographic movie? There's no plot to these things. There's no storyline. We're not going anywhere. A lady goes to Kmart to buy a toothbrush, figures, "While I'm here, why don't I blow somebody?" Never happens when I'm in Kmart. I'd be there right now. (CHUCKLES) (IN DEEP VOICE) "Attention, Kmart shoppers. "We're having a blue light special. "Six inches or less in the express lane, please. "Looks like he's got more than six inches up there, God damn it! "Now he's writing a check. We'll be here all fuckin' night!" She was a real screamer during sex. You know how some people be screamers and yellers and shit? Some people act like people you don't even know. You'd be having sex, all of a sudden now, "Put the lamp in my ass!" I didn't know she was a screamer. First time we were making love, it was 3:00 in the morning. I had a teeny apartment in a very quiet, residential, blue-collar neighborhood. Well, she's riding the bologna pony to heaven, ladies and gentlemen. She's buffing the helmet. I got that German soldier marching, God damn it. She starts screaming, "I'm coming, I'm coming!" It's 3:00 in the morning. I got a teeny apartment in a very quiet, quiet, residential neighborhood. Well, I'm slamming some ham, ladies and gentlemen. I'm taking a skin bus to tuna town, if you know what I'm talking about. She starts screaming, "I'm coming, I'm coming!" The neighbor marches over. "Make her come, God damn it! Make her come! "I gotta be at work at 6:30. Make her come! "I got two kids want to know where she's going! Make her come! "If you don't make her come, I will, God damn it! "And if I can't, Barney will! "He's got a dick looks like a leg." I like being a comic. I wasn't always a comic. Before I did this, I was a house painter for five years. Five years. (CHUCKLES) I didn't think I'd ever finish that fucking house. Before I did that, I used to work in a hospital. Emergency Room, Complaint Department. One time this lady came in. She was pissed off. She was looking for her doctor. She found her doctor. She backed him up around the corner and she said, "You son of a bitch. "These hormone pills you've been giving me, mister, are just a little bit too strong!" (CLEARS THROAT) She said, "I got hair growing all over my titty." Doctor said, "How far down does the hair go?" She said, "All the way down to my dick, "and that's another thing I want to talk to you about." One time this gay guy came in, had a 12-inch vibrator stuck up his butt. He says, "I don't know how it got there." The doctor said, "Maybe the gerbil dragged in. You think about that? "They've been known to carry them fucking things, you know." The doctor took x-rays. "It's gonna cost you $500 to get that thing out." He said, "$500? "How much just to change the batteries?" You guys have been a lot of fun. Thanks a lot. Good night. John Fox. He considers rape a cheap alternative to dating. Hey, we just had a quick newsflash. Bernard Goetz is back in the news, folks. One of the kids that he paralyzed, Darryl Cabey, is now suing Bernard Goetz for $50 million, which makes no sense, 'cause the first time he asked Goetz for 5 bucks, Goetz shot him. He's a fucking lame individual, if you ask me. And now, from the great state of Texas, ladies and gentlemen, Houston's chocolate kiss, Ms. Thea Vidale! Give her a nice hand! Hi, how you doin'? I want us all to be friends, and so we can all be friends, let me tell you something about myself. I was married for 10 years, and I can honestly tell you, ladies, after being married for 10 years, I rate sex right up there with cleaning the oven and defrosting the refrigerator. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it. So that's why I hired a maid. And paid her 10 bucks extra to keep the nigger off of me, you know what I'm saying? In 10 years of marriage, ladies, you will discover things about men that you never even knew. Like one, a man thinks he knows everything. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) But he don't know enough to wipe his ass, 'cause I can get you ten men up here and seven of 'em got skid marks in their underwear. But the worst thing in the world about a man is that they will fart anywhere. Oh, don't look like you don't do it, mister. 'Cause I bet you try to make a song out of it. And if you get a bunch of men together, they'll harmonize. Now, I'll be honest with you. When I was in love with my husband, I used to let him do it in the house. But then we had children, we bought 'em pets and such. Honey, he let one loose, he killed the dog, the bird... I have never seen a fish try to hold its breath. And men have favorite places they like to do it. My husband's favorite place is the supermarket, 'cause he'll be pushing the cart up ahead of me, and I'll be walking behind him, and he'll let one of these lead-lifters loose and leave me walking into it. And it's like a time tunnel. You can't get out. And you can't get but one look on your face. "Honey, did you do that?" "It slipped out." "I don't think so, baby, 'cause you got a hole in your pants "and a green cloud following you." And you laughing, lady, but you don't have no titties at all. You got little speed-bump titties. I think Barbie's titties is bigger than yours, baby. Maybe Ken's. You got little eggs that are never gonna hatch, honey. And your man is laughing at ya. But he won't be laughing tonight, will he, baby? 'Cause he gonna want some pussy, ain't that right? She told me she could suck your dick and eat a spaghetti dinner at the same time. And this motherfucker over here, he talking shit. You ain't had a pussy since pussy had you. And, you know, I just got divorced, honey. It's breaking my heart. I just got divorced, 'cause I know in my heart I was a good wife. I was a damn good wife. I cooked, I cleaned, I breeded children, I swallowed. I was a damn good wife. And it's hard to say this shit, but, you know, datin' is hard work, 'cause you can go to any club right now and you'll see some man standing by the bar in a three-piece suit like he's posing for GQ magazine. You've seen him, haven't you, ladies? Talking about... In reality, you know that suit came from JC Penney's. 59.95, two pair of pants, reversible vest, two shirts and a tie for good luck. And he's standin' in front of the real man, the true man, the man with the hairy chest and the gold chains. WOMEN: Yes! And the real man comes up to you and says, "Hi, babe. I'm 27, I'm single, "I have a brand-new condo and a 1988 custom-designed Porsche out in the parkin' lot. "How does that sound to you, babe?" "Sound like you got a lot of bills, son. "I'm lookin' for somebody got their shit paid for." The real man buys you a drink. He thinks now you're supposed to go to bed with him. What prostitute in the world you know go to bed with somebody for $3.25? (LAUGHS) Let's say... (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) You gotta keep up. Let's say we decide to go to bed with the real man, and you start to kiss his chest. Have you ever noticed that he starts pushin' your head down like this, like "X" marks the spot? "Give Mr. Winky a kiss." But I think we ladies ought to get together and make a list of all the men that can't make love and nominate one for a poster child. What do you say, girls? (WOMEN CHEERING) Oh, yeah! We could have a telethon, be like Jerry's Kids, called the Fuckless Wonders of America. We could have three categories, comatose genitalia, or lack of hardness, or as we say in the street, dead meat. We could have that other problem men have, spermazol projectory, or Johnny-Come-Quickly Syndrome. And that last one, that's a real heartbreaker for me, excess foreskin. All that meat and don't know how to use it. 'Cause if you think about it, ladies, for 30 minutes of a man's pleasure, hell, he could wipe it off with a Kleenex and call it a day. Women have to get up, go to the bathroom, douche, take a shower, wear a minipad... Come back to bed, this motherfucker been sleepin' an hour and we didn't have a good time. Now, I got... You know... But it's almost time for me to head out, so y'all been interesting. Y'all some sick motherfuckers, but I like you. I'm gonna leave you with some advice. Ladies... WOMAN: What? ...make the men spend money. MAN: Boo! Make 'em spend money, 'cause if they take you to Burger King and you give 'em some, they gonna talk about that. Now, here's my advice for the men. MAN: Thea! If a man has good credit, a woman will fake an orgasm. Don't lie, ladies. I know you do. 'Cause I was datin' my husband, he wasn't no bigger than this. But, my, he had a good line of credit. We'd be in the bed sometime, I'd be goin'... (SCREAMING) "Baby, baby!" (SCREAMING) "Can we go shoppin' now?" Thank you. You've been a lot of fun. Thea Vidale. Thea Vidale. Give her a nice hand, folks. Houston's answer to Mae West. And now, from Detroit, Michigan, don't forget the Motor City, we got a gentleman who says you don't have to be clean to be funny. And he likes to hang out at porno shops 'cause he likes the food. Please welcome Mr. Tim Allen. Yes, hello. WOMAN: Hey. God, I just spent eight days with my brothers, all seven of 'em, and I had to realize one thing, men are pigs. Right, women? WOMEN: Yeah! Yeah! Aren't we pigs? Yeah! (LAUGHS) Yeah! Just too damn bad we own everything, isn't it? (LAUGHING EVILLY) God, my balls are big right now and I don't know why. Humidity, I think. My mother raised seven boys, said, "You men are pigs. Don't speak to me. Grunt like the pigs you are." (GRUNTING) All you men need are three things. (GRUNTING) The only reason men are alive, according to my mother, is lawn care and vehicle maintenance. Because men are pigs. We do horrible things, don't we? WOMAN: Yeah! Men will light farts. I don't know why we do this. There's not a man out there hasn't had a blue flame shootin' out of his butt one time or another. They're pretty goddamn happy about it, too, huh? Women don't do shit like this. If a woman saw another woman's butt in the air and a flame comin' out of there? "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop that." But not a man. Boy, see the man's butt in the air, flame comin' out? (GRUNTING) And men like to burp. Oh, burping's a big thing for men. "Honey, that was some pretty good eatin'." (BURPING) (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Well, let me wipe the shit out of my eye. Thanks for that." Ever had the weird burp, right between a vomit and a burp, a vurp? (AUDIENCE GROANING IN DISGUST) You have, fuck you. You've seen guys doin' that. "Bob, I saw you..." (BURPING) Then you gotta re-eat it. Oh, um... (AUDIENCE GROANING IN DISGUST) Oh, forget the guy's feelings in front of you. "What the fuck was that, man? "Whoo! You killed my dog on that son of a bitch, boy. "You should eat some fruit or somethin'." And men are shit experts. We're shitsperts. Oh, men love shittin' and talkin' about it. "Honey, I gotta take a healthy dump." (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Well, I'm glad you alerted me to that." There's not a guy out here that doesn't take their shit like a creation. (VOCALIZING) ♪ Look what I've done There's not a guy in here doesn't take a good look at it before he lets it go down. Yeah! "Honey, come on up here a minute! "And grab that tape measure. Come on. "Think we got a keeper here, honey!" I think men would just as soon put a hook through it and get their picture took. (GRUNTING) We don't know shit about nothin'. Women got products. "What is this?" Uh, my brother's now lookin' at my mom, goin', "Hey, Ma, what's a vinegar and water doche?" "That's a 'douche.'" (GRUNTS) "Who makes this? Wish-Bone? What the hell is this, huh?" I've seen some weird ones. I saw Massengill has a douche with a hint of musk. (GROANS) Just a bit redundant, don't you think? Tryin' to make a beaver smell like a possum. Here's a good idea. And training bras. What are you training them for? Let them grow wild. (VOCALIZING) Boobs don't need training. It's Gomer caused all the goddamn trouble. That's right, God's fault. God made a man's arm just long enough, you drop it... (GRUNTING) You'd be a fool not to take advantage of a position like that, wouldn't ya? My mom hated it. "Boy, stop touching yourself." (GRUNTING) We love doin' that. Around here, you... I see all these people go, "Yeah, right here. Mow this, rake this, mow here. "Why don't you sidewalk this?" What the fuck does that mean? Like your balls are courageous. "Hey, Bob, that took a set of balls, buddy. "Pretty ballsy, Bobby. "Boy, that Bob's got a set of balls on him. (GRUNTING) "Oh, yeah." Bullshit. What's the first thing to shrink on a man when he's real scared? (EXCLAIMS) Your nuts are hidin' behind your pancreas. "Get the fuck out of there!" It's women should have the goddamn balls. My mom's a feminist author. She says, "Women should have the goddamn balls. "We have the periods, we have the kids, but you men... "Same jobs, less pay. We gotta..." You women should have the balls, right? WOMEN: Yeah! Yeah, fuck you, look at them. Do you want a set of these ugly fuckers? I don't think so. It's like God had some elbow skin left over, see. "Yeah, wrap it in that." A major design problem here. Ever caught your old man nude, tryin' to put that bathmat on the bathtub? "I'll get it, honey." Boy, you walk in there and go, "What'd I marry, a goat? "What the hell are those? "Why don't you get some Saran Wrap, honey? "Don't they spoil when they're out like that?" Damn right. Women, they should use your ovaries. You're not ballsy, you're ovarian. (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Helen, that took a set of ovaries, babe. "Pretty ovarian, Helen. "That Helen's got a set of ovaries on her." (GRUNTING DAINTILY) And you can be like an old man. He's out there being a prick. "Hey, honey, get me a beer, will ya, bitch?" (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Yeah, beer these, will ya? Beer right fuckin' here, eh?" You women don't want balls, no more than men want periods. Men with periods, wouldn't that be great? WOMEN: Yeah! (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Yeah! "Why don't you deal with the bloat, "the cramps, "the tender tits?" Aren't those fuckers weird. Just when they look great, you can't fucking touch them. "Honey, those look..." (SCREAMS IN WOMAN'S VOICE) I'd like to see men with periods. "Hey, Bob, how you doin'?" "Well, not so good today. "Oh, boy, I feel so fat and ugly. I don't know. "God, my tits are killin' me. I swear to God, I... "Yeah, I'm flowing like a goddamn river all day. I..." "You on the fucking rag, Bob?" "Yeah, I'm on the fucking rag today, I am. "I'm tryin' those light pads from Miller." "Yeah, they're not good, Bob." Fuck, right! But women don't know all about men. They don't. They don't know nothin' about boners. Boners, B-O-N-E-R-S. ♪ Boners, boners boners, boners ♪ Boners, boners boners, boners ♪ Two kinds of boners, the sleazy sexual boner like this guy's got right here... I'm not talkin' about that. I'm talkin' about the innocent boner, the boner men get like 20 times a day for no fuckin' reason. 3:00 in the afternoon, all of a sudden... (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHS) Hey, what the hell's that all about? You get that goofy little I-got-a-woody smile. (CHUCKLES) Can't get 'em when she wants 'em. (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Is that it for the night, then, Tiger?" I love that early morning boner, though. That's my favorite. That boner that's up a little before you are. 6:00, 7:00, 8:00. "Good morning, world. What the hell's that all about?" (VOCALIZING) The hammer of Thor! (GRUNTING) Boy, I saunter around the house lookin' for prey. (GRUNTING) Cat and the dog are going, "Get the fuck out of here with it." Women always think it's for them. My dad used to call that baby "Mornin' stiffness, boys." He'd walk by with a towel on it. "Shower time!" Always wanted to pee with us. "Come on, boys, pee with Dad." "No, you got that big old dick hanging out. No." You're a little kid, you got that little mushroom cap. Dad's got this dick of death. (IMITATES THUDDING) (SCREAMING) But women always think that boner's got their goddamn name on it. (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Hmm, aren't we up early this morning?" (VOCALIZING) "Yeah, but I gotta pee out of it, and that could take some goddamn time, babe." Women don't know about peein' out of a morning boner, do they? Saunter around the house with a loaded goddamn boner. "Watch out, give me room!" Gotta plant them feet, bend them knees. Push off of that wall and get down on it. You let it go, it looks like a Wham-o Water Wiggle. "Watch out!" I'm all through. You guys have been a lot of fun. Thank you all very much. Keep it going for Tim Allen, folks. Now, in the tradition of the fine comedy teams like Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, Sharpton and Maddox, we proudly present Otto and George. Thank you. Thank you. It's really great to be here tonight. My name's Otto Petersen. This is my good friend, George Dudley. How you doing, George? You nervous? Hey, I gotta work with your hand in my ass. I'm fucking uncomfortable here. I gotta take a shit and everything. Sorry. I had to ride here in the trunk of the car. It sucked! It was boring. I Turtle Waxed my dick, I was so fucking bored in there. Johnson's Turtle Wax, three coats. I want to see the water jumping off of it. That's right, I got a wooden cock. I was circumcised with a pencil sharpener. Least I stay hard when I'm drunk. (LAUGHS) Laugh it off, you fuckin' hard-ons. (CLEARS THROAT) George, please watch it. There are ladies here. There's ladies here? Blow jobs! Protein Slurpees! Check it out. Who saw this movie? E.T. Goes Down. Stop that. Blow jobs. My girlfriend gave me skull last night. She did a good job. When she was done, my cock looked like a totem pole and her face looked like a glazed donut. Protein Slurpees. (CLEARING THROAT) All right. George, uh, can't we do one of our old routines? Eh, you hard-on. Okay. Right now, we're gonna do some classic ventriloquism. Otto here is gonna drink a glass of water and blow me while I sing Lady of Spain. Blow jobs! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) All right. Everybody laughed. Hey, how many of you masturbate? Raise your good hand. I ain't ashamed to admit it. I beat my wood. There's nothing wrong with jerking off. Jesus Christ, I tried phone sex today. How'd that work out? Terrible. My dick got caught in the nine. (LAUGHS) All right. That party line is a bunch of shit. They show these beautiful girls, everybody calls it up, 20,000 guys are jerking off to one fat bitch in Jersey. I'm horny. Take it easy now. I got a log in my underwear. All right. Let's go to Macy's and fuck some mannequins. No way. You ever fuck a mannequin? They're nice and tight. (CLEARING THROAT) I fuck the mannequins at Macy's, but I buy in Alexander's. (LAUGHS) I'm going to Macy's. All right. I'm gonna fuck the whole store. All right, take it easy now. I'm gonna fuck the first and second floor. You can nail the third floor. Okay. That's lawn mowers, you dopey bastard. Okay. Look at this shit. They gave me my own microphone. Stupid cocksuckers think I'm real. You ever see that Twilight Zone episode? Yeah, I saw that shit. That's my favorite show. Yeah, I wonder why. I met Rod Serling once. He had a huge cock with eyebrows on it. (LAUGHING) All right. So you like porno movies? I made one. It's a fuck film with all puppets. It's called Caligula, Fran and Ollie. I fuck Miss Piggy in this movie. I porked her. Bacon shot out of her ears. I porked that bitch. (CLEARS THROAT) All right. All right, don't you think this is a nice audience? Yeah, I've seen happier faces at firing squads. Folks, I drive a cab for a living here in New York. Any of you cheap bastards take cabs? See if you recognize me. Hey, you want to get my feet back on the chair? I'm fucking swinging here... I'm sorry. ...like a marionette. All right. Make my ass look real. Okay. Get a fucking illusion going here. All right. Hey, George, uh, how's your girlfriend Gina doing? Oh, that slut? What do you call her that for? This girl's a slut. One time she spread her legs, and a Greyhound bus came out. The bus driver had a clothespin on his nose and the passengers wanted their money back. I exaggerate to clarify. You know, I went to pick her up one time and her father was there. What a fucking idiot. What happened? The guys says to me, "What are your intentions with my daughter?" I said, "Well, sir, I'd like to get the ball rolling "by de-veining your cock with a clam knife. "Then I'm gonna take your daughter with my eight friends "and we're all gonna get blow jobs from her. Protein Slurpees all around." All right. What are my intentions? I'm gonna try to fuck her. All right. I wrote a song about her. It's called, How Can I Tell You I Love You When I Can Hardly Breathe Down Here? Thank you very much. We're Otto and George. Yeah, laugh and the world laughs with you, fart and you sleep alone. Thank you, thank you. Otto and George. That's right, a boy and his log.

Except Bruce Springsteen. I don't love Bruce Springsteen like I used to. Oh, Bruce, yeah, come on. Let's be serious, let's be objective, let's open our minds. Bruce has been singing the same fucking song for 12 years, all right? How much more bullshit... If we can get Reagan out of fuckin' office, we can tell Bruce to write new songs, okay? I mean, Reagan only became president to get the medical benefits. This fuck, you know, every three months he had his dick cut off, his hair dyed...

(AUDIENCE CHEERING) Let me hear you say yeah! AUDIENCE: Yeah! Say it! Yeah! Yeah! Well, all right. All right. That's it. End of your part. Thank you. Hope you don't mind if I smoke. I know it's gettin' harder and harder to find a place to smoke these days. I feel like I'm in high school with the bathroom window cracked again. You know, they say cigarette addiction is harder to break than heroin addiction. Yeah, so I'm 0 for 2. (SCOFFS) And I don't do drugs. I don't think they tell us the truth about drugs, though, you know. They tell you marijuana smoking makes you unmotivated. That's bullshit. WOMAN: Yeah. When I was high, I could do everything I normally could do just as well, I just realized it wasn't worth the fuckin' effort, man. That was it. Why get out of bed? Shit, I'm just gonna get in traffic and go to a job I hate. Fuck it. Stay in bed and watch cartoons. All the news stories about drugs are negative. Same LSD story every time. "Young man on acid thought he could fly, jumped out of a building. "What a tragedy." I'm thinkin', "What a dick." If he thought he could fly, why didn't he take off from the ground and check it out first? Why ruin it for everybody else? You don't see ducks lined up to catch elevators to fly south, God damn it. I'd like to see a positive LSD story. Would that be newsworthy? Just once? "Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed "to a slower vibration, that we are all one consciousness "experiencing itself subjectively. "There's no such thing as death. "Life is only a dream and you're the imagination of yourselves. "Here's Tom with the weather." What a fuckin' story. Why do people do drugs? Why do you do drugs? Why? Who wants to live in this fuckin' world? Who? Who? A world where John Lennon was murdered, yet Barry Manilow continues to put out fuckin' albums, man. That's where we live. Why is it always good guys are murdered? John Lennon murdered, John Kennedy murdered. Why is it good guys are murdered and mediocre hacks live on forever? Martin Luther King murdered, Gandhi murdered, Jesus murdered. Reagan shot, wounded, cancer eight times. That fucker still walks. (GROWLING) This guy's like Jason at this point, man.

Pretty frightening coincidence there, huh? But I do not believe he's the anti-Christ, 'cause that'd be too obvious and he's too stupid. But I'm gonna tell you something. I know who the anti-Christ is. He is in physical form, he is upon the Earth. I know who it is. Pretty heavy burden, but I do. WOMAN: Who is it? Dick Clark. Dick Clark. Yup, you love him. What else would Satan do, huh? Master of lies, year after year, week after week, systematically lowering the standards of the Earth, making mediocrity a goal. Dick fucking Clark. As long as he's been on TV, he hasn't aged one fuckin' day, man, has he? Doesn't seem human does it? Natural. That's not Dick Clark. That's a Dick Clark rubber mask with a zipper in the back. Underneath, when he gets off that TV show, after he's brought you Rick Astley and Debbie Gibson with a straight face, there's another clue, he goes into his office and he unzips that zipper. Underneath there's a cloven hooved, horned wolverine. (DISTORTED VOCALIZING) There's a knock at the door, the door opens, John Davidson walks in. (DISTORTED VOCALIZING) John Davidson drops his pants and his bikini panties and leans over a desk and the wolverine mounts him. (DISTORTED VOCALIZING) A black, blood-gorged tick crawls out of the scaly penis of the wolverine into the bowels of John Davidson. John Davidson is now pregnant with the children of the Prince of Darkness. In the off-season, he becomes fat and swollen and begins to shit the brood. (GRUNTING) Geraldo Rivera. (GRUNTING) Kenny Rogers. (GRUNTING) Wham. (GRUNTING) Oprah. Can't you see? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Thank you. My mom wrote that. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Come on. Well, you've been a very nice crowd. Before you go, I understand there's tensions out there. I understand people are snapping right and left, killing other people. If you're gonna kill somebody, have some taste about you. Don't kill fuckin' John Lennons of the world. And I know I could snap. I know it, I feel it, I hate it, I got it. I'm at a red light. The guy before me has his right blinker blinkin' and he's not turnin'. Man, I'm just... (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Fuck it. (IMITATING GUNSHOTS) You can make a right on red, you fuckin' asshole!

Let me hear you say yeah! AUDIENCE: Yeah! Okay. Keep it going for Bill Hicks. Bill has a new book out, by the way. He wrote a children's book. It's called How To Kill Grandpa. Pick up a copy. Now coming to the stage is a man who lives in New York City and Los Angeles. He's got a big fuckin' house. He's the only thing that Einstein could never figure out. Steven Pearl! All right, how are ya? Yeah, fuckin' A, man. Oh, I shouldn't smoke on stage. Smokin' these new Jewish Mother cigarettes.

First time I ever did comedy in my life was in a town called Berkeley, California, the land that time forgot. Go to Berkeley today, there's a guy on every corner with elephant bellbottoms goin', "Anyone got Hendrix tickets? "What? He did? When?" Yeah, great, man. You hear about acid rain in Berkeley. They walk around like... Tie-dyed armpits. It's nice, you know. First time I ever did comedy was in Berkeley ten years ago. I'd never been on stage in my life. I'm freakin' out. I'm sweating like Elvis after a bowl of chili, man. Just freakin' out. On top of that it was Lesbian Poetry Night. Oh, good. My first time ever on stage, I gotta follow a pissed off dyke who looks like Ernest Borgnine. All right, showbiz. It's like, "Now the poetry of Maude Butch." "Men, men, men. Evil men. Evil men with your penises representing death and hell. "Rip them off and bleed to death. Die, men. I hate you, men." "And now the comedy of Steven Pearl."

Right here, dick brain, huh? Blow me, douche bag, fuckface." "Great sermon, Father. See you next Sunday." Hey, how are you? Hey, you, don't piss in the collection plate. Yeah. It ain't too degrading living here if we don't make a lot of money. Get an apartment the size of a shot glass, $8 million a month rent. Beautiful view of a brick wall and a bloody dismembered hand hanging. Hey, this is livin'. Fuckin' big-ass cockroaches for a roommate. New York roaches, man. Footballs with legs. (IMITATING FOOTSTEPS THUDDING) Oh, must be the leader. He has the word "Voit" written on him. Shit. New York roaches ain't scared of nothin'.

"We didn't have penises or..." "Shut up, Grandpa." I feel like doin' that now. I'm 32. Times have changed so much since I was 22, feel like doin' the Grandpa bit to teenagers today. "When I was your age, we didn't have MTV. "We had to take drugs and go to concerts." "Oh, what do you know?" It's scary. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Oh, thank you for that Star Search applause.

You're gonna love his jokes so much, you're gonna want to take him home and tell him to your friends. Just make sure you wash him off before you do. Ladies and gentlemen, how about a nice hand for Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling! Give him a nice hand. Hey! All right! Everybody's in a good mood? I love it when the Jewish girls get excited. Their nipples get hard and point at doctors and lawyers. WOMAN: All right. Girl goes to the gynecologist. He examines her. He says, "You have acute vaginitis." She says, "Thank you." Guy goes on a date, puts in his finger. She says, "Put another finger." He says, "What do you want to do, whistle?" What's it mean when two lesbians make love? It doesn't mean dick. Couple's in the living room. He says, "You're dry tonight." She says, "You're lickin' the rug." Guy's gettin' married on Saturday. Friday night, his friends take him out, get him waylaid, by-laid, Rolaid, mislaid, up, down, up, bing, bang, boom. Forget it, his pecker's a mangled mess. What to do? He takes two Popsicle sticks, puts 'em here, wraps 'em in adhesive tape. Next day, here they are in the honeymoon suite. She walks out stark naked. She says, "Look, honey. Untouched by human hands." You gotta think quick. He pulls down his pants, says, "Look, huh? "Not even out of the crate." I'm in a good mood. My brother got laid last week. He snuck up on me, the bastard. So a college professor goes to bed with his wife. He's not that tired, so he's gonna stay awake and read while she sleeps, right? So he's readin'. Every once in a while, he reaches over and tickles her on the fun spot like, "Hoochie, coochie, coochie." (LAUGHING) I know the end of this. "Coochie, coochie..." She says, "Will you stop that? "Will you stop reachin' over here and teasin' me like that?" He says, "I'm not teasin' you." He says, "I'm wettin' my fingers so I can turn the page." Come on! Hey, you think that's rough on you, you think that's rough on you, I tried that stunt with my old lady. Next day, she signed me up for Evelyn Wood's Speed Reading. My old lady drives me crazy. She told me pickin' my nose was disgusting, and from now on, I gotta do it myself. Three guys and a girl marooned on a desert island. Three guys and girl marooned on a desert island. After one week, the girl's so ashamed of what she's doin', she kills herself. After another week, the guys are so ashamed of what they're doin', they bury her. (AUDIENCE GROANING IN DISGUST) Hey, after another week, they're so ashamed of what they're doin', they dig her up again. So this sex therapist says to the British guy, the French guy, and the Italian guy, "What do you do to drive your wife crazy after sex?" The British guy says, "Well, sometimes I brush her pubic hair. "She goes crazy." French guy says, "Well, monsieur, sometimes I drink champagne from belly button. (IMITATES SIPPING) "She goes crazy." He says to the Italian, "What about you?" He says, "What do I do to drive her crazy after sex? "Sometimes I wipe my dick on the drapes. She goes fuckin' nuts." Nurse walks in, says, "Doc, what are you doin'?" He says, "I'm writin' a prescription." She says, "But you're holdin' your thermometer." He says, "Jesus Christ, some asshole's got my pen." Did you hear about the guy that couldn't come? We had to go get him. Skinny guy went to Alaska, came home a Husky fucker. "Pop, can I have $20 for a blow job?" "I don't know. You any good?" There's a gorilla walkin' along in the jungle, and there's a lion gettin' a drink of water. And the lion's tail is up, and the gorilla's like, "Ho, ho, ho." And the gorilla goes up and slips him the Liberace. (LAUGHING) You know what I'm... I think everybody's still with me, right? The gorilla takes off, run into a hunter camp... Runs into a hunters' camp, jumps inside a tent, puts on a safari outfit, pith helmet, grabs a copy of like the Johannesburg Times, sits down in a chair and starts to read. The lion comes running into the camp like... (ROARING) He sticks his head in the tent and says, "Did a gorilla come through here?" The gorilla says, "You mean the one that fucked the lion in the ass?" The lion says, "My God, you mean it's in the paper already?" Liberace wasn't gay, was he? Nah. Here's a quick impression. Here's Liberace's mother callin' him as a child. "Yoo-hoo, lunch time, fagot!" See, people don't laugh at that like they used to laugh at that stuff, 'cause it's gotten so scary. I heard that it's got to the point where you can catch AIDS from a New York City toilet seat if you sit down before the last guy gets up. New gay sitcom, Leave It, It's Beaver. Jewish fagot, Heblew. Gay choirboy choked on his first hymn. Here's the worst one, right? Guy goes into a dentist's office, sits down in a chair, pulls down his zipper and takes out his willy. The dentist says, "What are you doin'? I'm a dentist." He says, "There's a tooth in there." Guy's drowning, guy's drowning. The lifeguard swims out, drags him in, puts him on the edge of the shore and starts pumpin' his arms. Here comes water. He's pumpin' his arms. More water. Here comes fish, right? Seaweed, clams. Another guy comes along and says, "Hey, you better get his asshole out of the water! "You're gonna empty the ocean!" See, it was like a fucking pump, you moron. My big shot in the movies, I'm working the plant life down here. How about the guy that's bopping his old lady on the tile floor in the bathroom? He's giving her a pop. He's bopping her. He's bopping her! He says, "Spread your legs! Spread your legs! Wider! Wider!" She says, "What are you trying to do, get your balls in?" He says, "I'm trying to get them out!" Guy goes to the zoo to feed the monkeys. (LAUGHING) This is my favorite. Guy goes to the zoo to feed the monkeys. He throws the monkey a peanut. The monkey picks up the peanut, sticks it in his rear end, pulls it out, eats it. The guy's like, "Whoa!" No, there's more, there's more. (LAUGHING) Take it easy, lady. If you wet those, what are you gonna wear tomorrow, right? (LAUGHING) He throws the monkey another peanut. The monkey picks up the peanut, sticks it in his rear end, pulls it out and eats it. The guy's like, "Whoa!" He goes to the zookeeper and says, "Man, that is one very stupid monkey." (CHUCKLING) The zookeeper says, "No." He says, "That's a very smart monkey. "Since last week, somebody threw him a big peach "and he ate it and he couldn't pass the pit, "so now he measures everything." (LAUGHING) So Lady Di and Dolly Parton decide to have a popularity contest. Dolly runs over to England, goes out on stage, takes off her blouse and her bra and goes like this. Crowd says, "We love you, Dolly! We love you!" Lady Di walks out, sits in a chair and douches herself. The crowd's like... (GROANING IN DISGUST) "You pig!" Judge walks out and says, "Well, Lady Di wins." Dolly says, "What do you mean, Lady Di wins?" He says, "Hey, royal flush beats two of a kind." (LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) I love you, man!

(INAUDIBLE) INTERVIEWER: Larry, tell me, why did you become a comedian? The band broke up. What makes me different? I like doing horrible things to innocent things. That's why comedy's fun. What does it take to be a comedian? Why are you a comedian? I'd be... Why are you a comedian? Why am I... Why? Why? Why? Why? (CHUCKLES) How about I tell you? I'll tell you. Why am I a comedian? Because the nuns can't tell you to shut up, that's why. I started telling jokes to people when I was a kid, and I could tell right away that it made them feel good. (CHUCKLING) And then I found out it could get me laid and that made me feel good. I'm this black comic, but there's no big dick jokes, no big lip jokes, no watermelon jokes, no we-walk-like-this. I don't talk about taking people's TV sets. I'm still keep my consciousness up. Well, I try to come off as a friend, you know. INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh. Try to come off real likable. I'm sort of like the whacked out, weirded next door neighbor, who drops over to borrow a beer and you can't get rid of him type. MONTY HOFFMAN: (CHUCKLING) Right, right, right. You know, you like him to pieces, you got a friend just like him, but you wouldn't trust him with your sister. (LAUGHING) Matter of fact, I could use a blow job right now. I forgot how they taste. (JOHN FOX LAUGHING) New Jersey, where a fart is refreshing. Yeah, I like Jersey. It was a good place to grow up and leave. Yeah. Is it true if you fart in a car in Jersey, they roll the windows up? Oh, definitely. Yeah, that's good. I mean, that's... Seal that shit in. You can make it all the way to Paramus. I'm curious. Why did you become a comedian? (CHUCKLING) Ah, I guess 'cause it beats welfare by this much. This much? Yeah, it... Just for the... What do you... What do you think's gonna happen in this film? What's in it for you? This film, I think, is a great opportunity because I want to say some things that capitalist networks won't allow me to say. Yeah. They... Maybe this socialist film project... Getting laid feels good? Stephanie, we fucked it up. No, it's terrible. I'll give you another chance, little buddy. INTERVIEWER: George, why did you become a comic? Garry Shandling sucks. (COMICS LAUGHING) We've been banned from a lot of clubs 'cause we're completely different. And to those clubs, I salute you. What makes me different is I think I'm being honest. If the world was perfect, then everybody'd be Bill Cosby, I guess. (BOTH LAUGHING) All right, how about the... Two deaf guys meet on the street. The first guys says, "How you doing?" The other guy goes, "I'm doing great." He goes, "Jesus Christ, you learning to talk?" He says, "Yeah, I'll give you the name of my doctor." He gives him the name, the guy goes to the doctor. He walks in, says, "Doc, do you think you could "teach me how to talk?" Doctor says, "Sure." He says, "Just bend over that table over there "and, well, drop your drawers." The guy goes over, drops his drawers, bends over the table. Doctor gets a big long pole and shoves it up his asshole! (LAUGHING) (CHUCKLING) And the deaf and dumb guy goes, "Ah!" He says, "Very good. Come back tomorrow. We'll start on the B's." (SIGHS)
