We have been tasked with assassinating Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira. I want you to give your life for me. Insolent! Let it be in the place of your choice. Good. Let's meet again. No... No, please. Shin... Wait for me with the light on. I will not allow them to pass through here. We will show them that Akashi samurai fight to the death! 13 ASSASSINS Reign of Ieyoshi, 12th Shogun First year of the Kōka era,1845 April 5, early morning Edo Castle Near Babasaki Gate At the gates of the mansion of Doi Toshitsura, a member of the Council of Elders. A samurai prepares to perform seppuku. This samurai is the minister for Edo of Naritsugu Matsudaira, Lord of the Akashi clan of the 100 thousand koku, Zusho Mamiya. He made the decision to resign from his position due to the bad behavior of his master, and with his death he wishes to urge the government to take action. For three days after this event, closed-door meetings were held at Edo Castle. Naritsugu Matsudaira is the son of the previous shogun Ienari. As an in-law of the Akashi clan, these scandals were enough to create commotion in the government. The lord shogun has made a decision. He has ordered that this be resolved peacefully. Peacefully? It is understandable. After all, he is the shogun's younger half-brother. Making Naritsugu part of the Matsudaira family was a serious mistake of the Council of Elders at the time. But Sir Doi... The right thing to do is to act according to the Shogun's wishes. It is our duty to repair what is crooked. That damn official Doi...! Why is it taking them so long to decide what to do with that traitor! If the Council of Elders won't figure it out... I will do it myself! Please wait, Sir Hanbei! One moment! Kito! Lord Kito! What's the matter with you? I said don't lay hands on anyone from the Mamiya family! So why involve his wife, son, daughter-in-law, and innocent granddaughter? Our Lord commanded us... And where is he? Lord Kito! If it's about the Mamiya family, it's already too late. What...? Don't tell me they even murdered the girl... What an atrocity... Make sure no one from outside finds out about this. You heard me? Yes... Excuse me, sir. The public affairs inspector, Shinzaemon Shimada is here. Sorry for calling you suddenly in the middle of the night. I've been a widower for a long time, so I don't have a problem with going out whenever I can. I'll get to the point... I would like you to meet someone. He is here now. Would you meet him? Yes. I serve the Lord Chancellor of Owari. My name is Yukie Makino, I am in the Kiso Agematsu garrison. And well, I'll go by parts... If you allow me. In March of last year, Commander Matsudaira of the Akashi clan stopped for the night at Kiso Agematsu, in Owari territory on his way to his annual stay in Edo. KISO AGEMATSU, INN OF THE DAIMYO The Bishu family of Owari, Along with their daughters and wives, visited him there to show him their hospitality. Make sure everything is in order. Yes sir. And also check the numbers again. It is understood? Yes sir. Uneme! Father! Did you remove the painting on display in the back room? I did not realize. I'll solve it right away... No. Leave it to Chise. She is very dedicated. Yes. Chise. Yes sir? However, two months before, Chise had married my son. And assigning her to work for Lord Naritsugu turned out to be a serious mistake. Tell me, who are you? I am a servant in the Owari garrison, and the wife of Uneme Makino, sir. It is a waste that there is such a beautiful woman hidden in the mountains of Kiso. Come! No, please! Let go of me! Let me go, please! Leave us! Come with me. No Please! I beg you! Let's go! Please! No Please! I beg you... Uneme! Let me go! Please wait! Please, let go of me, father! Do not interfere. Uneme! Chise! Chise! Chise! Insolent! Chise! You brute! Stop! Chise! Chise! Chise! Chise... Insolent! Chise... Chise... My husband! She committed suicide that same night. My husband! And so... The Akashi clan procession departed without so much as a thank you. When they arrived in Edo, the Owari clan repeatedly asked them to account for the matter... But we have had no answers about it. I sent my son and his wife to a terrible and untimely death. I don't think I can go on living... My son... And my daughter-in-law... It wasn't their time yet... And well? A tragic story, no doubt. And on top of it all, Lord Shogun intends to integrate Naritsugu to the Council of Elders. Will he give him a seat? It means that the nation will be in the hands of that man. Once the Shogun has ordered something, there is no going back. But... Although I am a member of the Council that leads the nation, There are things I can't do. But... But a man who lives by the Samurai Code... Listen, Shinzo... There are things we must do for the good of the citizens. In other words... He wants Lord Naritsugu dead. Please understand... I had no idea what to do, and you were the first person that came to mind. But this mission... What you propose is... Do not say it! It is for the good of the population. No... I want you to give your life for me. I agree. A spanking would have been preferable. That verdict is too benevolent. Our lord is the younger brother of the Shogun. It's no surprise that he gave him special treatment. That's the problem! This case should have been solved exceptionally! Where is Sir Doi's honor? Excuse me. I'm back. I was waiting for you. During the night we managed to bribe some servants and get some information. We know who has visited Sir Doi's mansion in the last three days. Show me! Owari's vassal, Yukie Makino... Makino...? Yukie Makino from Owari... He's the one who was involved in the incident last year. Makino met with Shinzaemon Shimada from Public Affairs. Shinzaemon Shimada... Do you know him? Know him? We have been partners and rivals in studies and with the sword for as long as I can remember. We are great friends. And... What kind of person is he? The best person to handle a national emergency like this. Things... They couldn't look worse for our clan. Impressive. I borrowed your dojo without permission, as usual. A lot of time has passed. How about a match? One moment! Wouldn't it be better to wait for the crisis to pass? What? Crisis? This morning I noticed that you were not yourself. People can pretend with the face, but it is impossible to hide the feelings with the sword. I still have a lot to learn. For the last five years you have given me more money than a ronin like me deserves... I did not refuse to receive it, of course. Because I knew the day would come when I would pay you with my life. I have only lived in anticipation of that day. We samurai have spirit and determination. If that doesn't help you now... I will have nothing left but to regret the last five years. Perhaps... Did that little gesture mean so much to you? Thank you. Sir Shinzaemon. Oh Kuranaga. We cannot allow Mr. Hiyama's kindness to be in vain. How would you like to include him in this mission? I agree. If I don't listen to the wise advice, of Saheita Kuranaga, he becomes very scary. Not at all, don't say that. I chose seven of my subordinates. They are waiting in the living room. I beg Mr. Hirayama to come with us. Good. These men are prodigies with the spear and sword. Introduce yourself to Mr. Shimada. I'm Inspector Mosuke Otake. Shojiro Ogura. Yasokichi Hioki. I am Second Inspector Gunjiro Mitsuhashi. My men not only know how to use the sword, but also the bow. I am Second Officer Gennai Higuchi. Yahachi Horii. I am Koyata Koga. Of our 68 inspectors and 103 second class inspectors, these seven are the best. So with your vassal Rihei Ishizuka and me we are nine. No. We are ten. I am Kujuro Hirayama. It's a pleasure. Are you going to trust me with your lives? You don't have to ask. We are prepared to give our lives. Very well. This time the mission is... To assassinate the Lord of the Akashi clan, Naritsugu Matsudaira. Akashi is a clan of 100 thousand koku, More than a thousand samurai belong to him. No fewer than 300 of them in Edo. Next month, Lord Matsudaira will travel back to his territory. Once he enters his clan's territory, he is untouchable. We lack time and people. It will be an almost impossible mission, but I will tell you this: In these times of peace, there are no samurai with real battle experience. Neither among our own, nor among the enemies. No one can imagine what will happen when men risk their life in battle. Catch one of them. Did you understand? Yes sir. Well... I withdraw. You... Who are you? Reply. You left Shinzaemon Shimada's residence, didn't you? What were they talking about? What do you care? Are you Akashi samurai? I see... So they're plotting against our clan? Speak! Do you prefer to fight? Speak, if you want to live. Or else I will kill you. You are better off not knowing. You are one of them? Identify yourself! Kujuro Hirayama, a ronin. Now Hanbei will know who he is facing. Who is that Hanbei Kito man? The most skilled and cunning vassal of the Akashi clan. And for me... The best of friends and the most formidable enemy. A single cut. And this one too... Such mastery... With this, Shinza's goal has finally become clear. Do you understand what it means, Asakawa? Yes... Hey, ronin. How about you pay us right away? I'll pay for this spot when I've sold something. The word of a samurai is golden. What are you talking about? Do you think you can sell this garbage? Hey, what are you doing? What if you break something? Hey, you have to pay for the place before occupying it, it's the rule. If you don't have money, give us something as pledge. How about this sword? No Please. Anything but that. It sure is a bamboo sword. If it isn't, prove it. Oh boy, come here. Good. Come on, cut that! What? You will not do it? Hurry use your bamboo sword! What are you waiting for, lowly Samurai? I refuse. What did you say? But with you it's another story. Let's go...! I'm here. Shin? Shin, are you here? Yes. Welcome home. Every time the popular Miss Koen is late, I get restless and think maybe you're cheating on me. What nonsense are you talking? I was so eager to see you and I came home so late. Oh yeah? Aren't you just saying that to cheer me up? Tell me, Shin, what will we do if Lord Shimada discovers us? Did you meet my uncle? Yes. I thought I should tell you soon. The feudal lords have come and gone from Edo many times this month, the inspectors should be busy. Anyway. That doesn't concern someone like me. I'm not even going to say hello to him. Do you want a drink? Sorry I'm late. Come on in. Let me introduce him. He is Heizo Sahara, a ronin from Bushu province. Mr. Sahara said something most interesting. That he would join us if we paid him 25 ryos in cash. 25 ryos? But why...? I'll tell you because I don't want any misunderstandings. I am in favor of your objective. But I am a ronin who has nothing to do with this matter. I think I shouldn't get involved gratuitously. What will you use that money for? Let's see... 12 ryos to settle years of obligations and unpaid debts, and to cheer up my loved ones. 3 ryos for a tombstone for my wife who died from so much worry. 5 ryos to prepare for this mission. And the remaining 5 ryos will be to be able to taste the opulence before dying. Very interesting. Paying 25 ryos for this determination is a bargain, Sir Shinzaemon. For more than a month after the January 5 incident, the Akashi clan closed the gates of their territory and ceased all activities, claiming that Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira had fallen ill. On February 23 they abruptly gave the news of his immediate departure to his lands in the province. Shinza. What insolence! Are you here Shinza? Do not interfere. Stop there! Shinza! Wow, Hanbei what a surprise. It seems that I interrupted you. What? Not in the slightest. We were just finishing. Forgive me. But I'm glad I got to see you. The truth... It is that tomorrow I return to my lands. I see. Have a safe trip. You know? I assumed you would come. Where were we? If I remember correctly, I owed you two battles. Let's save it for the next time we meet. Next time? Alright. Let it be in the place of your choice. I'll look forward to it. Good. I think fate has played a trick on us. You were a guard at the Shogun's residence. When I got the same post a year later, you were already Inspector. Your salary was 100 koku higher. I could never reach you. Then I was lucky enough to be called as Lord Naritsugu's manager and get paid a thousand koku. If I think about it... I find you obnoxious. Neither of us could have done anything about it. The samurai have no choice. This is the fate that has befallen you and me. The only thing that... Either of us can do is see our own way. And no matter what happens, have courage. Valor, huh? I'll take those words as a gift... And I'll gladly leave. Good. Let's meet again. Definitely. Koen... Hey, Sir Shimada. You look as pretty as ever. Do you mind if I step in for a moment? Sir Kuranaga is here, huh? He asked me to take part. He asked me to give my life for him, but I refused. I feel a greater responsibility towards the geisha who supports me than for my status as a samurai. I have learned very interesting things here. Dogs are unconditional to their masters, but cats are not domesticated. They only cohabit with humans. So you'd rather be a free geisha like a cat than a loyal samurai like a dog. I see. Tell me, uncle, can you play? I also hated life as a samurai, and I lived for a time immersed in hedonism, more or less when I was your age. So I learned to play a little. You can choose to live a life of pleasures. But do not think that this is easier than dying as a samurai. Good bye. Oh, are you leaving already? Yes, sorry for bothering you. I'm back. Oh, why do you have such a scary face? I'll pour us a drink, hold on. Koen. What's happening? Shin, are you going to go? You will go, right? No... No, please. Shin... No... But... You're coming back, right? When? Huh? When will you come back? Well... At least within a month. And at the latest, for the Obon festival. Wait for me with the light on. Shin... Shin, wait! Oh Shin! Shin... You're a fool. THIRTEEN ASSASSINS February 24th. First year of the Kōka era, 1845. The Lord of the Akashi clan of the 100 thousand koku, Naritsugu Matsudaira, left his residence in Edo for his province. The Akashi clan's procession made several stops without Shinzaemon Shimada and his men taking action. And gets further and further away with each passing day. How many do you think each of our men can handle? If we follow them and wait for the opportunity, I'm sure there will be, being such a long trip. If we ambushed them on these grounds, they could each deal with three at once. That Shinzaemon Shimada hasn't appeared... Don't let your guard down. There are still many kilometers ahead. The journey is just beginning. Little by little the distance between the procession and the capital became greater. How much longer are we going to wait? If we don't leave soon, we won't catch up. I wonder what Sir Shinzaemon is thinking. There is no reason to rush to death. Eat some dango and relax. What? Enough! Sir Shinzaemon wants to see you. Finally. Until today We have patiently watched the passing of the days. Six days have passed since the Naritsugu procession left Edo. You have been extremely patient. Thank you. In this mission both parties risk their lives. They are just as determined as we are. Also, with the difference in numbers, we can't expect to win. Our only option is to devise a plan to reduce their numbers. Now, our target is halfway through his return, so he brings with him an escort of over 100 samurai on foot. So... We'll put the plan into action here, on Kiso Road. We'll split the procession and deduct their numbers in half But how and where will we face him? We have decided to kill Lord Naritsugu here... The town of Oshiai, in the province of Mino. But there is no guarantee that the procession will pass through Ochiai. Yes, exactly. So we have a plan. An almost foolproof plan. Naritsugu Matsudaira's procession proceeded through Shinshu along the Nakasendo road. Shinzaemon Shimada and his group rushed towards Shinshu to get ahead of them. The days passed inexorably, and March arrived. OCHIAI TOWN, MINO PROVINCE Hey. Can I find Tokubei Sanshuya, the leader of Ochiai, here? Take them. Yes sir. Excuse the rusticity of a provincial room like this one. Come on in. Kayo, take care of sending that letter. Come in please. Sorry for the bother. Come over here please. You say you want to rent the whole town? 4 or 5 days. We will also have to make some changes. How about 10 ryos per house? For the inconvenience. In addition to labor cost. That's a lot of money... There's more. We also want you to evacuate the town for one day when we tell you to. If these are orders from the Council of Elders, we must do it, whether we want to or not. And well, I guess you won't give me any more details even if I ask you. I agree. I'll take care of everything else. I am deeply grateful to you. Meanwhile, the Akashi clan procession was passing through the town of Fukushima, in Kiso, and headed towards the Owari territory. It was March 7. Mister Kito! What's going on? We have a big problem. The Lord of Owari refuses to let us pass through his territory. What...? Does he deny us the passage? By order of the Lord of Owari, Councilor to the Imperial Court, passage through the territory is denied. from the Owari clan to the Lord of the Akashi clan of Banshu province, Naritsugu Matsudaira. This is terrible! It couldn't have happened at a worse time! What do we do, Mr. Kito? What does this mean? Are you going to stand there and allow this to happen? Sir... Silence! Lord... Lord! Perhaps the Owari family is a branch of the Tokugawa clan, But I am the son of a shogun! Brother of the current Shogun! I will not submit to a sign! Cross! I told you to cross! We will make the Owari clan of the 610 thousand koku bawl. Aren't you going to cross? You have every right to be furious, sir, but... If you don't plan to cross, then I'll do it myself! Move over! Mister! Stop. Observe... Why, Lord Kito? If possible, we must pass through the territory of the Owari clan. Let's see if the Lord's usual stubbornness gets us through. Just pay attention. Mister! Do not go. If anything happens, I, Hanbei Kito, am prepared to die for my lord. Stop worrying and just watch. Who are you? Say your name! If you appreciate your life, move! Or I will kill you! As you wish. What? It seems that you have already forgotten me. In March of last year, you murdered a member of the Owari clan at the Kiso Agematsu inn. I am Uneme Makino's father, Yukie Makino. Kill me and pass, if you can. In the name of the Owari clan of 610,000 koku, I will not allow you to pass this way. How cocky! Mister... It's you Hanbei! We will handle. For now back off. Good. Samurai will escort the Lord on horseback along the path of the Ina people. 53 people, including the Lord. To avoid the Owari territory, we will return to the main road through Ina, and we will regroup in Nakatsugawa in order to go greet the governor of Mino, Lord Toyama of the Naegi clan, after passing through Jikkyoku Pass and Ochiai. Wait. Why go back to the main road? Let the 53 horsemen pass from Ina's path to Sanshu's, and travel by boat from Okazaki to Akashi. No need to stop by to say hello to the Naegi clan or any other clan. The Owari clan blocked our way on the annual return to our territory. If we cross those territories on the way and we don't visit them, we will be the laughing stock of the whole nation. So it's more important not to be a laughingstock, or the life of our Lord? More valuable than our 100 thousand koku? Answer me that. Let them laugh, we just have to wait one more year. In April of next year, when I return to Edo, the Lord will be a member of the Council. He will be untouchable. What's the point of paying even a single visit and risking the life of the Lord and the clan? Hey! Will you let your master be the mockery to save your own life? I thought samurai always chose death over ridicule. Then what has the Akashi clan been paying samurai for all these generations? With all due respect, but we are in times of crisis. This requires desperate measures. We could fall into Shinzaemon Shimada's game... Shut up! The Akashi clan is afraid of a miserable vassal of the shogunate? That's pathetic! Shame on you! Shame! And you... I thought I could trust you. I guess I misjudged you. Listen to me well! no matter what happens, we will visit Lord Toyama of the Naegi clan, and the Lords of all the territories we cross. That's an order! I still have a plan. Take care of him. Yes. Wow Kuranaga. Sorry for the disturbances. Don't worry. I have good news, Sir Shinza. Thanks to Lord Makino's courage, we managed to block the Akashi clan at the Otaki River. Sir Naritsugu turned towards Ina taking a limited escort with him. So they did just what we had planned! Finally, they have decided to go by Ochiai. And what about Lord Yukie Makino? Well, you see, Lord Shinza... The night before I met him at Agematsu. When I told him about the plan and asked for his help, Lord Makino shed tears of anguish and he regretted not being able to join us as he is a vassal of the Lord of Owari. The next day, after seeing Lord Naritsugu leave, he stayed on the spot... And opened his belly with a single cut... I was afraid that would happen... Later... I found out he didn't even leave a note. He probably did it out of consideration for us. We cannot allow his efforts to have been in vain. Daimyo Naritsugu Matsudaira and his group of 53 horsemen, separated from the procession, they left the Kiso route, and headed for the Gonbei road. The group's goal was to avoid Owari territory, make a detour along Ina's path, and then return to the Kiso route from Iida, via the Odaira road, to Nakatsugawa, where they would merge with the procession and regroup, before going to visit the Naegi clan. Uncle. Shinrokuro... Thank you for this. Everything you asked for is done, This is the village leader, Sir Tokubei Sanshuya. I am Tokubei. I think my nephew has already told you all the details. This must be a huge hassle for you. I beg your pardon. Not at all, don't worry. I am the only one who is aware of everything. Please leave it in my hands. Can you show us the town now? I'd like to get to know it first. Of course. Over here please. We can block this street and launch the first attack here. Maybe we can beat 5 or 6 men. But this width gives his numbers an edge. We must lure them into an alley and confuse them. We must divide them and prevent them from regrouping, whatever it takes. We have to make the trump move here. Probably the final battle will take place here. The enemy will try to advance towards Nakagawa. We must do everything possible to isolate our target, or we will fail. Hey! Where is Sanshuya? Oh, Sir Shunrokuro. This way, come on. Is something wrong? No... They are there. Good. Lord Shinrokuro! Wow, this is a problem... Anyone who saw this would come to the same conclusion... Soon a battle will start in this town. But I... We agreed to rent the town, but we haven't said anything more to your father. But it seems that someone could not stand the curiosity... You are wrong! I'm not a snooper! So what were you doing? I wanted to know if I could do something to help you... Me? I see... I'm glad. So that was it. What? They disappeared from the Ina path? They were last seen passing through Komagane. After that they disappeared from the road. Is it possible... That they took a shortcut down the Sanshu road to Okazaki? Without visiting the Naegi clan? Nope... I doubt the willful and egotistical Sir Naritsugu would desist from doing so. I am sure they will come. After Naritsugu Matsudaira's troop of the Akashi clan disappeared from Ina's path, time passed relentlessly. March 13. Here! March 14. March 15 at night. By horse, it takes a day and a half to get here from Komagane. At the latest, two days. We are wasting too much time staying here. I propose that we wait no longer, we leave the town tonight, and move towards the Sanshu path. No, it's still very early. But...! Hanbei is with them. They're hiding somewhere out of the way waiting for our reaction, I have no doubt. They will go to visit the Naegi clan when they are sure that there is no danger. Shinchaya will have to be watched, but we cannot count on the locals to do so. I think we should send someone. Yes... You are right. Kuronaga... Let me go again. Oh no... You just got back. To be fair, the other day you overpaid me. I thought the tombstone for my wife would cost 3 ryos, but it was only 2. I also asked for 5 ryos to prepare myself, but I haven't used a single mon. Also... As a poor ronin, I thought I wanted a taste of a life of luxury, but... The truth is that I didn't know how to do it. And so, I had 8 ryos left over. Lack of money is a problem, but excess is a burden. I'll give it back. No, no! There's no need. Keep it, please. Oh yeah? Well, then send me there again. In that case, please go. Do you agree? Yes. Good. Please. Excuse me. What a character. But a very useful one. March 16 also passed in vain. Observe. Lord of Akashi's troop is headed this way! What? Are they coming? They must have walked the Odaira road during the night. Very soon they will descend through the Jikkyoku pass. There are a total of 53 men on horseback. Excuse me! Hanbei... You will finally come. First year of the Kōka era, 1845. March 17. Around 3 am. Before dawn, a strange and deep fog covered the town. The preparations are done. The villagers have been evacuated to the mountains. Get ready! Yes sir! How much more time is left for Nakatsugawa? I asked you how much is left! Kito! Sir Kito! Excuse me...! What the hell is this? Were we deceived? Behind! Go back! Damn! Behind! Yes. We have located Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira's troop of the Akashi clan in Banshu province. This troop serves the direct vassal of the Shogun, Shinzaemon Shimada! With all due respect, our bows have to stop them here and now. Don't leave the horses! Tear down that barricade! Don't back down! Nakatsugawa is our only way! Let's get through that barricade! They are nothing more than vassals! We will show them that Akashi samurai fight to the death! Come on, take it down! Lord! We can go this way. Good. Asakawa, it's a trap! come back! Listen! Tear down that barricade at any cost! Yes sir! Lord Kito! Protect the Lord! Otake! Hioki! Keep Hanbei away like we planned! Understood! I found you, Hanbei Kito! Take this! Damn you Hanbei Kito! Why are they taking so long? Lord! Lord Kito! Over there. The time has come. Let's go. Yes. We can go out this way! They're coming! Here! Let's go. Yes! Lord... Lord! Here! Look! Find a way to escape! Yes! Mister! Hanbei? Do something soon! Coming this way was a mistake. What's up Hanbei? This is the kill zone that Shimada prepared. We fell into his mousetrap, there is no way to escape! Koyata is the only one guarding Kiso's departure, right? Yes. If our prey comes back, they'll take him down easily. We are not enough. Yes... Lord Naritsugu fell for the trap! Together with Hanbei? Yes, it seems that they are trapped. Good! Tell everyone to go down and fight in the streets! You have to close the net, before the fish escapes. Yes sir! Excuse me. Yes. Well, Hanbei... How will you get out of this? They're here... Listen to me everyone! Our only way to escape is to go back the way we came! Get ready! And come out by force! Yes sir! We can't handle everyone. Let's go back. Leave! What's happening to you? Our Akashi clan of 100 thousand koku is in danger! Show them Akashi samurai fight to the death! Go ahead! Let's get out of here! Hanbei sprung into action, huh? The last strategy. Take them to the sawmill and separate Hanbei from the target. Yes sir. It is time, Lord Shinza. Yes. Why are you here wasting your time? Hey Kito! Here. Yes. Here they come! Stop there, Hanbei! Lord, over there! Asakawa! Did you find a...? Hanbei! Get ready. What's wrong, Hanbei Kito? Much ado about nothing! Lord, you better back off. Go ahead! This thousand koku samurai will not be defeated by the likes of you. Stop! Asakawa! Do not separate yourself from our Lord! I've been waiting for you, lord. I assume you are Naritsugu Matsudaira, Lord of Akashi Castle. I'm Shinzaemon Shimada, direct vassal of the court, By order of the Council of Elders, I will take your life. Wait! Sorry! Forgive me! Forgive me please! Those words are unworthy of the son of a shogun. Do not resist and prepare to die. I can't stand the thought of taking your life... But for the good of the nation, of its people, and for the many tragic deaths you have caused, I can not let you go. Get ready. Lord! Shinza... If I let you live... I won't be able to call myself a samurai. Face me! Shinza! Very well. Uncle...! Do not approach! Take care of the rest. Sound the signal. Yes. Ogura! Hanbei... Hanbei... Shinza...! Why did you let yourself be cut? Impressive... Such tenacity... I've lost, Shinza. I'm looking forward to the rematch... In the afterlife. Hanbei... Have you seen it, Kayo? We do something like this for pure valor and without any reward. This is us samurai. This is being a samurai... March of the first year of the Kōka era, 1845. During his return from the capital, Mr. Naritsugu Matsudaira fell ill and his death was reported upon returning to his territory.
