[ Jazz playing ] That was great. Why the hell would you wanna be a cop? - Why not? - That sounded great. Wynton marsalis I'm not. - I don't know. - Good evening. - Hi. - Compliments of the house. Thank you, darling. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Here's to you, kid. - And you. Now that's why I'm a cop. You get paid money when you're a cop. My cop chops are better than my horn chops. - Actually, I prefer the classics-- - mmm. --Tchaikovsky, stravinsky. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. However, Tchaikovsky was purelyclassical. Stravinsky on the other hand is like listening to Charlie Parker-- he incorporates the classical with improvisation-- a melody and a variation on a melody. - You follow? - Yeah, I just can't believe you're a cop. [ Chuckles ] Why? - You're so sensitive. - Oh. I thought all cops were jerks. - [ Both laugh ] - Man: Not all of them, honey. - Just the good ones. - [ Groans ] - I'm Nick berzak. I'm frank's partner. - Hi, Nick. - How are you doing? - Pretty good. Frank been telling you about his police exploits? Actually, we were talking about classical music and jazz. Well, let me tell you something about frank. Frank Hazeltine is the best cop I have ever seen. I've seen some good ones. You know, I once saw frank go into a bar full of dykes and kick the shit out of all of them. Then he burned the place to the ground - just to teach them a lesson. - He's just kidding. - Oh. [ Laughs ] - Don't be shy, man. Did you tell her about the nine-year-old kid you blew away last week? It was all a mistake, actually. I mean, the kid had a water pistol, and it looked real. Now most of US would have waited, but not frank. He blasted the kid right between the eyes. He had to Bury the little fucker in a rubber bag. If you'll excuse me, - I really have to be going. - Wait a minute. Hey hey, don't go. It gets better. - You're sick. - [ Chuckles ] What's the matter with her, anyway? Fuck you. I mean, she would probably take you back to her place, and you have the best sex of your entire life, so big deal. Did Teresa turn you down again, putz? No way, I had to hold her off with a cattle prod. When are you gonna give up on that woman? I cannot help it if I'm in love with her, all right? Look, to hell with women, all right? Who needs them? - It's just you and me, frank. - I'm not going. Come on, man. You'll love it. How long have you been staking out decosta? And what have you got to show for it? Total zip. The man is a sleaze. I intend to prove it. You are a very sick man, you know that? Yeah. You're making me sick, eating that garbage. Hey hey hey. Don't insult the good name of El Maya, pal, just because you can't get alfalfa sprouts with truffles. You know what I mean? You really don't care anything about your stomach, do you? Yeah, it's my stomach. I put whatever I want in it. True, you got that right. [ Laughs ] Oh, Harry, you're too good for me. Mr. Decosta, Mr. Pogue's here. - I'll see him in the study. - Yes, sir. I was just getting warmed up. That's it for tonight, honey. I've got business. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. Read a book or something. You do read, don't you? I see you're pogue. You come highly recommended. This is the gentleman we discussed. Right, the talkative guy. You want me to do it, you know, slow? No no, there's no need for that. He's an old friend. One thing. You know you're being watched? Yes, berzak-- a cop. Actually, he's a fanatic. Forget it. I'm not wired. [ Kids chatting ] - Hi. - Hello, speedy. You couldn't have mailed it? I don't trust the mail. - It's a week late. - Sorry. Really. Can I come in? I was just about to go out. Just for a minute. I wanna talk. Fine fine. - Just for a minute. - Yeah. You changed this place around. Where's my walleye? - What? - My walleye. I threw it back. You dumped my walleye. That was the largest walleye caught in bay lake, Minnesota. That was a record, you know that? Then why didn't you take it to your place? It's only been two years. Besides, I didn't come here to argue with you. Then what did you come here for? You wanna go to dinner? No, I don't think so. - No. - Why not? You got something going on? You got a guy coming over, don't you? Yeah. What, he's gonna come over, and he's gonna take you to a movie, buy you a real big dinner, and then you're gonna put on the sexy underwear that I bought for you - that you would never wear for me. - That's it! Get out of here now. Oh really? Aren't we watching decosta's house any longer? - I don't do that anymore. - Please leave. Hey, I've got better things to do with my time, all right? - Fine, go. - Yeah, uh-huh. Goodbye, Nick! Saturday it is! [ Whistles ] Get over here. - Pay attention. - Hey, Nick. - Yeah? - I got a cut on my knee. Okay, what do you got? She had a guy over to visit her this week, a guy in a red corvette. Well, all right, darling. That's good. Keep up the good work, okay? Hey. - Me? - Yeah. You going to see Teresa berzak? Yeah, I am. You're not her husband, are you? [ Chuckles ] No, I'm her physician. You're not one of her contacts, are you? I'm afraid I don't understand what-- don't worry, man. I think we caught it in the early stages. She's probably gonna tell you about it right now anyhow. See, it's very important, getting in touch with all her friends in her intimate circle. Have a good day, man. - Right. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Sure. [ Carnival music playing ] [ Singing "cielito lindo" ] Hey, what's happening, baby? You sure is looking fine tonight. Whoo! Women like you shouldn't be left all alone on a sweet night like this. But hey, that's okay. 'Cause old Lionel's here to make everything nice. How about a bite of my foot-long? Hey, beat it, asshole. I already got a boyfriend. And a very lucky man he is too, mama. And I'm gone. Man: Step right up and test your strength. Come on, ring the bell, win a prize. [ Bell dings ] And the winner: Number 50. All right, kids. Sorry, better luck next time. Man: Step right up. Three throws. All right, young lady, you show him. Man: Three tosses for $1. Just $1. Come on over here. You, come on. Hey, you. Come on, try your luck, buddy. Police officer. Freeze! Get out of the way! - Move it! Move! - Yo, man! Get out of the way! 119 to central. Send some backup, would you? 5th and bonaventure. - 10-4. - Man: 10-4. I'll call it in. Man: B-5.

Back off, pig! - [ Gunshot ] - [ All scream ] Ladies, please! This is a house of god! Preacher, tell this man the ingredients of mortal sin, would you? A serious matter, sufficient reflection, and-- lose the gun, or I'm gonna kill this son-of-a-bitch. - You hear me? I'll do it! - Go ahead. God damn it, man. I'm not kidding! Neither am I. You kill him, I'll kill you. Hey, wait a minute. I got it. I'll kill him. I'll kill the son-of-a-bitch. Yeah, I'll kill him. That's it. I'll kill him, you kill me. Don't. I'll do it. - I will! - [ All gasp ] Hey, man, come on. Let's kill some more people. There's lots of people to kill out there, man. And then it'll just be you and me. Come on, man. Shut up, man! Shut the fuck up! Come on, man! We'll all be dead! Man: You crazy bastard! Berzak: Let's do it! Let's die right now, yeah! - Man: You're crazy, man! - Berzak: Come on, do it! [ Grunts ] Eh, fuck it. - Woman: What? - On the ground, asshole. Right now! Man: Yeah! Put your hands out with your palms up. Come on, do it. Right foot over the left. Frank. [ Chuckling ] Oh my god. You do make one ugly broad. Jesus, man, I love being a cop. [ Laughing ] Man: I'm really proud of you guys. That was a damn good job. Hey, come on. It's 18-year-old scotch. Hey, I had 18-year-olds before. Very sweet. - This will fuck you up. - [ Knocks ] [ Phone ringing ] In the future, I would appreciate it if you would wait for sufficient backup. Kaminski, the d.A. Wants US to extradite boudreau. - The hit man? - Yeah. As a matter of fact, I want these two to do it. He got picked up when he wasted a pusher down south. He wants to make a deal. He said he'll trade his employer who he claims is the source of all the China white coming into the city, not the mention the new influx of black tar. Okay, so three guesses-- who is it? Al carolini? Enrique Escobar? - Tai Charlie? - Harry decosta. Ah. Come on, Nick. Come on, get off of that. Hey, I know it was decosta. Harry decosta is the chairman of the united fund and of the best friends of the mayor, berzak. So? Not to mention a major contributor to the boy scouts - and the philharmonic-- - hey, that was his shit last night. So was that airport case last month. - I guarantee it. - Be that as it may, you two leave for del mar tomorrow morning, 9:00. Get some rest. - Larry: Why them though? - I can't go to del mar. Paul: I want undercover officers, and these are two of the best. I want to make sure that Charlie boudreau stays alive to testify. My mother lives in del mar. You think somebody's gonna take a pop at him, captain? Yeah, it could happen. Just make sure it doesn't. I haven't called my mom in a month. I'm a dead man. Hey, I expect more sympathy out of you, frank. [ Chuckling ] Hey, speed man. I don't want to go unless-- honey, I'm home. [ Rewinds, beeps ] Woman: Nicholas, it's your mother. I'm very upset with you. Nicholas, are you there? If you're there, pick up the phone. Don't monitor this phone, Nicholas. Pick it up. You haven't even-- [ Screeches ] [ Beeps ] Nicholas, it's me again. I'm sorry I got angry, honey, but after all, when a son refuses to call his mother, I mean, there's something very wrong there. Well, it's not asking much. I'm asking you to call me and tell me that you're fine, that you're well, that I love you, and that I miss you and that's all. That's not a lot. You can reverse the charges. I'll pay for the collect call. [ Beeps ] I'm not a well person, Nicholas. [ Beeps ] Frank: Nick, it's frank. I can't go to del mar, man. I just found out they want US to fly. I'm terrified of flying. You know flying scares the hell out of me. You know I'm scared stiff of flying. You gotta confront your fears, frank. I am quite calm. Woman on tape: You have no fear of flying. I have no fear of flying. You enjoy the sensation of flight, and you understand that you are safe. I enjoy the sensation of flight, and understand that I am safe. Berzak: You're gonna go down in flames! You are, by far, an asshole. [ Laughing ] Have you called your mother to tell her we're coming down? Hmm? Uh, not yet. [ Laughs ] Oh shit. You are quite calm. I am quite calm. - Here, you keep the change. - Thanks. - Thank you, sir. - Sure. You got something for me? Mr. Boudreau's mouthpiece is dragging his feet, and I won't be able to let you have him until tomorrow. Hey, man, we gotta be back tonight. But Mr. Boudreau will be here until tomorrow. Oh, that's great. What the hell are we gonna do in del mar until tomorrow? I'm not seeing my mother. Did you call my mom? - [ Laughing ] - You're in deep shit, pal. I haven't called her in a month, man. [ Buzzes ] Woman: Coming. So you come to town, and I gotta hear it from your partner? - Hey-- - hey? - How do you know I'm not going out? - Are you going out? I never go out. You know better. Come in here. I haven't seen you in so long, I forgot what you look like. I look like this, mom. - You lost weight, baby. - No. Yes, you're thinner. Want a cup of coffee? I just made a fresh pot. - Yeah. - Oh, good. So how long are you staying this time, babe? - I gotta leave in the morning. - What? I gotta be back in the morning. Oh no. I should have known. Well, I still get to see that sweet face. Ooh, I'm gonna give you a niner. Ooh, that was fun. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Frank sends his love. - Oh, he's a sweetheart. - Yeah. I'll bet he saves your life. Not that often. Want some banana cake? - Yeah. - I made it fresh today. How's Teresa? Better off without me. Well, it's your own fault, babe. [ Chuckles ] You should have married decosta. You spend more time at his house than you do in your own. I mean, it's the truth. I don't blame her. Oh, thanks, mom. You should have gone to law school like your brother. - Hey, fuck lawyers! - Nicholas berzak! - I like being a cop, all right?! - So did your father! Aw, shit. It happens, all right? I just don't want it to happen to you. No sweat, mom. [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah, great. Jokes now, right? Yeah, look, I don't need this shit. - No no no no, Nicholas, no no. - It's all right. - It's cool, no problem. - Come on, no, look, no no no. - What do you think we've just been doing? - We won't fight anymore. I promise. Okay? Stay for dinner. I'll make you your favorite. - Sloppy Joes? - And fries. - Really? - Yeah, really. You're shitting me, right? Hey, I don't shit you. Come on, we'll go peel the potatoes. God, mom, I love you. I love you, baby. Come on, boudreau. - Hi. - Hi. - [ Both chuckling ] - Yeah. Bye, see ya. You take care of yourself. Bye. [ Door shuts, engine starts ] I was gonna ask you where the fuck you've been. - Hello, Charles. - It's Hazeltine... And berzak. Christ almighty. I'll never make it back alive. - How the hell are you doing? - I'm doing just fine. Yeah, look, just give me a tip, all right? What do you say to the bitch when you first see it? All right? Woman on tape: Your inward self is balanced. Frank: My inward self is balanced. You have no fear of flying. I have no fear of flying. You have no fear of flying. I have no fear of flying. Berzak: So Charlie, who's pipelining all the Chinese shit and the black tar into L.A.? Fuck you. Come on, man. Al carolini, right? Johnny ruffino? - You guys are narcotics cops. - Yeah. I am quite calm. [ Chuckles ] I am a dead man. It's Harry decosta, isn't it? Fuck off. - Hey, frank! - [ Muttering ] Berzak: Frank! - Hey, man, we've got trouble. - [ Gunfire ] What the hell was that? Everybody down! Jesus, I am gonna go down in flames! Yeah. You okay back there? Shit. Landing gear. Yee-haw! Oh, shit! I can't believe this happened. - You okay, frank? - No, I'm not. Shit! Boudreau! Boudreau, freeze! - Come on, Charlie. - [ Cow mooing ] It's only a matter of time. Got that son-of-a-bitch. I saved your life, young fellow. You might have saved my life, but you ruined my career, buddy. Shit! Call an ambulance! Haul ass! Charlie, you're gonna be okay. - Bullshit cop. - Yeah. Just tell me it was Harry decosta, okay? You know, I killed a lot of guys with a shotgun. I always wondered what it felt like. It sucks! Just tell me it was Harry, man, would you, please? Shit. Charlie? Shit. - God damn it! - Old McDonald had a shotgun. - Shut up. - I don't wanna hear any of your bull, berzak. Somebody tipped off boudreau's extradition. I think you're trying to cover up for these two idiots. Pending the investigation of this matter, I want these men at desks. Now get out of my sight, all of you. Let's go. [ Muttering ] What? I was just talking to myself. [ Horn playing ] Frank: Like that? - Yeah, that was great. - Yeah? But I'll see you at the natural food seminar? - Okay, I'll be looking for you. - Great. - Both: Bye. - It's good to see you. Mmm mmm. [ Sighs ] - Berzak: Has it always been like this for you? - Since I was 10. - Can't figure it out. - I don't think about it. What the fuck is that shit? Yogurt, yeast paste, lecithin-- all the things you ought to be eating. Want some? No way, I'm on a low-mucus diet. You know that. - Yeah. - I've been thinking, frank. It's decosta again, isn't it? No, it's not about decosta again, frank. I think we ought to go after the guys that hit boudreau. Figure they're local. Now how do you figure that? Because they're working for decosta. There's that name again. What, frank? They made US look real bad. The entire squad thinks we're screw-ups. So now you wanna screw up real big to remove all doubt, right? No, I don't wanna do that. I'm just an agile guy, frank. I can get my foot in my mouth. I can even work with my nose to the grindstone, but my ass doesn't fit under a desk - and neither does yours. - No no no! [ Knocks ] Who is it? [ Berzak with accent ] What's happening, man? Some brothers downtown told me you got v.C.R.S for sale. Get out of here, man. You got the wrong house. I'ma ignore you. I got cash, motherfucker. I need 20 of them. [ Squeals ] [ Pounding ] Put your hand on your head. Keep it there. Hey, I was just on the toilet thinking about you all, man. Ain't life a bitch? Yeah, hiya, Casey. All this yours, brother? Yeah, brother. Well, see, I'm about to get married. You know how everybody gives you the same present? - Oh yeah yeah. - Oh yeah, that's right. That's right. What, you got this $8,000 rolex for Christmas, right? Yeah, I got that from my lady, man. So how come it's engraved, "with love, to Dr. Ira kettlebaum." Check it out. That's what the bitch calls me, man. Oh, it's like a pet name, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [ High-pitched voice ] "Stick it to me, Dr. Kettlebaum." - [ Grunts ] Right? - Oh yeah. - Berzak: Is she a real squealer and shit? - Yeah, she's a freak. - A squealer, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, look. You brothers want something, right? So why don't you take yourselves a v.C.R. Apiece? You know better than that, Casey. We want a line on the dudes that popped Charles boudreau. Hey, look, I ain't got nothing to do with that, man. - That was downstate. - We figured the guns were local. Yeah, and unless you wanna produce receipts on all this shit, including the rolex... You dig what I'm saying? Okay, man, I'll look around and see what I can do, all right? All right, you do that. Take it easy, Casey. Take it easy, big fella. - We got to book this shit in. - I'm excited. Hey, Nick, yo, you know what they're calling you on the streets now? - What's that? - Ber-zerk. They should meet my mother. Right, frank? Yeah, she's probably an ugly bitch. You think Casey will come up with anything? He better, or I'll step on his kettlebaum. Oh, why did I eat those extra jalapeños? 'Cause you got an unconscious hostility - towards your colon, that's why. - Oh, shit. - What? - It's 8:10. I'm supposed to be having dinner with Teresa tonight. When are you gonna give up on that lady? She deserves better. I know it, but I can't help it. I'm in love with her. - All right? - All right, okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Frank: See you later. I'm a cop. Be cool. Sit down. [ Mutters ] Carlo. Shit. Don't breathe, all right? Hey, sorry, man. It's Nick berzak. We went to high school, man. We stole a trans am. Oh yeah, Nick. How you doing? - Good, man. How are you doing? - You look good. You got some blood on you, man. - You okay? - It's your blood, Carlo. Oh, wow, I must be hurting or something, huh? - Yeah, man. - Hey, I'm on medication, Nick. Yeah. Okay, listen, Carl, you just go home - and dry out, all right, man? - Okay. - And get some ice on that lip. - All right, man. All right, man. You're new around here. What's your name? - Malcolm. - Malcolm. - Yeah, what are you, welcome wagon? - Yeah. Yeah? I've seen you oozing around the street. - What is your scam? - Me? - Yeah. - I sell amway products. - [ Both chuckle ] - Yeah. I catch you dealing any soap flakes in this neighborhood, - I will cripple you. - I ain't afraid of no jive-ass cop, man. I know my rights. [ Grunting ] Malcolm, I am not your normal jive-ass cop, all right? And around here, you got no rights. You must be ber-zerk. You don't know the half of it, baby. Hey, Malcolm, have a nice day. - [ Knocks] - Coming! Hi, ready for dinner? What happened? Dinner at 8:00. Don't you remember? No, Nick, I never said I'd go to dinner with you. - What happened? - Why? You got somebody here? No, I don't. What happened? I just beat the shit out of a guy I went to school with in high school. I caught him in the middle of a buy, and I fucked him up real bad. I can't do it again. I can't. God. God, why do you have to make this so difficult? Don't do this to me. I don't wanna do this to you. Can't you understand that I just need to take care of myself now? Yeah yeah yeah. I'm sorry. Are you gonna be okay? God damn it. I get the feeling I'm paying for a lucky accident. Hey, it wouldn't have happened if I wasn't there. Let's just say I motivated it, hmm? Oh, by the way, that cop who always watches your house-- what's his name? - Berzak. - Right. --He was one of boudreau's escorts out of del mar. The way I hear it, he's got a real thing for you. Now for a small fee I could-- I don't bother killing cops, pogue. It's bad for my reputation. However, I do have a transaction this weekend. Be nice if he wasn't around. Maybe a small diversion? A family crisis, perhaps. I'm running a special. Berzak.

Ain't you ever made mud pies when you were a kid? - [ '80s music playing ] - [ Crowd cheering ] [ Woman shrieks ] Nice ambiance. Of course, once the yuppies discover this place, it's gonna be swamped. Wouldn't you like to get in there with them? - You've got no respect for the human body. - Sure I do.

I don't know. I swear, I don't know. He'll never make a good lawyer, Nick. He can't lie for shit. Come on, move it. You can go back down. All you gotta do is tell US who killed Charles boudreau.

I'm gonna throw up! - Well, technically you'll be throwing down, Bobby. - Yeah. - Oh god, please, oh god. - God's got an alibi. Try somebody else, chief. Hey, Nick, you think maybe the boots are a little too tight? - Yeah. - Pogue! Terry pogue! - [ Sobbing ] - It worked. It worked! - I told you. - That's right, frank.

I appreciate that, Bobby. Hey, do you think that you could, you know, help me down? Sure, Bobby. Sure. Oh, great, man. Thanks. [ Screaming ] Oh my god! - Oops. - [ Thuds ] So decosta represents your father, and you scarf all of this junk food to fulfill an oral longing for your mother's breast, which incidentally, is 70% fat. Oh, that's great, frank. First, you ruin food for me, now you gotta ruin tits. - Oh shit. - What? Freeze! Police! Freeze! I don't know why I tell them to freeze. They never freeze. [ Tires screeching ] [ Screams ] He should have froze. It's not like we didn't tell him, right? Am I missing something here? Is it now departmental policy for detectives to make up their own assignments, act on their own authority? They're acting on my authority, Paul. Oh, on your authority. How nice. I put them on desks. I ought to bust all three of you down to traffic. Look at it this way, captain. We got the guy who whacked boudreau in the hospital under 24-hour guard. Now he can finger decosta, of course. Decosta again? I'm sick and tired of hearing about decosta. You haven't got a shred of evidence to prove he even kicks his dog. Harry decosta is a decent, upstanding citizen, god damn it. The doctor says we can talk to pogue tomorrow, Paul, - then we'll have our evidence. - Oh, all right. That's wonderful. Then I want you to assign two detectives to go to the hospital to take pogue's statement, but not these two. Berzak, Hazeltine, this is the last break you get from me. You stay away from the hospital and off of this case. Is that clear? Out. [ Muttering ] I don't blame him. - He knows what he's talking about. - What? I was just talking to myself. Thanks for covering for US, Larry. I don't know why I keep saving your guys's asses. Because in your heart, you know we're right. [ Phone ringing ] Telephone, sir. - Decosta. - Man: I found him. - He's alive in the hospital. - What hospital? County general. He broke a couple bones. - I see. - Want me to take care of it? No no, just do what you normally do. I'll take care of it. [ Jazz playing ] Very nice. Mmm, smashing. - Who is? - You are. - I am? - You are. I am smashing? You are smashing. You are smashing too. - I am? - You are. [ Rings ] This is memory Lane, Herman. Berzak: Hey, Herman. Nick berzak. Hey, how are you doing, Nick? - Yeah. - Can you get her to the phone? Yeah, don't tell her who it is, man. Sure. Excuse me. There's a call for you. Oh, thank you. - Hello? - Hello. You know that gentleman you're sitting with? - Yes. - Yeah, did he discuss his sexual preferences with you? - Who is this? - Look, that's not important, baby. Did the son of a bitch discuss his sexual preferences - with you? - No, why? I don't know why he does this to me. I mean, well, I guess it's because he gets some kind of perverse thrill out of toying with my emotions. It's probably because he's a cop. You know, he has to flirt with women to prove that he's a man. You know, woman-to-woman, I feel so cheap and so used. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. - You faggot. - What? Berzak. You're a shithead, you know that? I mean, just because Teresa blows you off, doesn't give you the right to fuck up my life, shithead. Have I told you recently what an asshole you are? Why don't you fill me in on the details - on the way to the hospital? - The hospital? Nick, this is goddamn idiotic. You know what Ferris said. - Hey, Ferris is a jerkoff. - Well, be that as it may, why can't we wait until Ferris has his boys question pogue tomorrow? Ferris's boys are jerkoffs. [ Beeping ] Woman over P.A.: Dr. Tanney to secretarial station. It's only Mr. Pogue's medication. How are we doing, Mr. Pogue? How is he doing? - Hey, Dr. Tanney. - Tanney: Hi, speed. - How are they hanging? - Cozy. - Glad to hear it. - What is that shit? I guess everybody knows how rusty they're getting. That is uncool. Hi, guys. - Nope. - Hi, Nick, right? - What are you guys doing here? - We're here to see pogue. Nobody sees him. We got orders. Captain Ferris sent US over personally. How come lieutenant kaminski told US specifically not to let you guys in there, especially if you said you had orders from captain Ferris? Kaminski is a bullshit artist, all right? Frank, tell them. Four dodger tickets, all right? And two super rib dinners at argents, okay? - You're not getting in there, berzak. - God damn it. [ Pogue screams ] Woman on P.A.: Code blue, 12th floor, stat. - Code blue, 12th floor, stat. - [ Flatlining ] Oh shit. - Visitors, Mendez, rise and shine. - I hate morgues. That's him. Joseph Mendez, professional hit man, - worked freelance. - Didn't mind doing over kids either. - This guy was a badass. - Really? He hasn't given me a bit of trouble. Yeah, well, I guess we'd better get going. Really? I was in the middle of ordering lunch before you guys came up here. You sure I can't interest you guys in anything? - No, thanks anyhow, man. - All right. Anybody else? Just the one pastrami then. So what do we do now? What you do now, frank, is you go fishing. You're both on vacation. What are you talking about? I just spent an hour in Ferris's office saving your asses again. He was all ready to suspend you both. I finally convinced him it was just battle fatigue. You need a little time off. So okay, two weeks. Take it. You know what's really weird, man? Yeah, every time we make a move, somebody is one step ahead of US. Yeah-- Ferris. That's calling it pretty close, pal. Where the fuck are you going? Malcolm. Berzak: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, huh? Oh man, you guys ain't got no respect for the dead. All right, come on out of there, Malcolm. Come on. Detective Hazeltine. - Up against the wall. Come on. - Yes. What have we got here? A nice little toy, huh? Yeah. All right. What have we got here, Malcolm? What, a little blow? A lot of blow. Hey, this is that-- this is that black tar, isn't it? Yeah, I'm thinking about getting into the roofing business. - What's this? - What? This shit. What is it? Actually, that's my mother. Malcolm: Hey hey hey hey. This don't look like no police station to me. Frank: That's because we're on vacation, - and we've got all the time in the world. - You dudes are crazy. Hold that thought, baby. So you gonna rape me now or what? [ Chuckling ] I wanna talk about Harry decosta. - All right? - Feel free, man. - Personally, I never heard of the dude. - Oh, is that right? Then where have you been scoring all your black tar? I forget. Damn, you junkie's got bad memories. Oh, that's cool. No, we got people that remember for you, Malcolm. You see, the word on the street is that you are rapidly becoming somebody's top salesman. Oh, Malcolm. Shit. That black tar's good, isn't it? You popping that stuff three times a day or what? So where is the next shipment coming in? Between your mama's legs. My mother? That's a good one, shithead. There's nothing I like better than a good joke about my mother. - Asshole. - You're a dead man, ber-zerk! - Oh yeah? - Everyone on the street's talking about it. On the homicide hit parade, you are number one with a bullet, Jack! The beauty of all this, we don't even have to lay a hand on him. Look at him. He's starting to shake already. - You look a little pale, brother. - Yeah. And we got lots of time, right, frank? We're on vacation. Pig! I want my lawyer! No problem, Malcolm. Just tell US about decosta. Where did you last meet him? In bed with your mama. Oh, that's right. And she said you were both lousy. Yeah... Nothing I like better than a good mom joke. Malcolm: I've never gone this long before, ever. - [ Singing ] - Stop it, stop! ♪ You are the one who can make US all laugh ♪ ♪ but doing that makes US break out in tears... ♪ [ Screaming ] Oh god, stop it! All right, all right, all right, all right. Tomorrow-- the stuff's coming in tomorrow. Where? Just get me well first. [ Strums guitar ] All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! All I know-- listen, the stuff comes in through some trucking warehouse on the south side. I swear, I don't know the name of the place, okay? [ Groans ] I swear. [ Groans ] Okay. [ Moaning ] Enjoy yourself, Malcolm. You dick. Oh, you're a dead man, just like pogue. - What about pogue? - Yeah, what about pogue? Pogue-- what about pogue? Decosta had him iced, just like he's gonna have you iced. But how do you know it was decosta? He talked to his man, and then he hired Mendez to shut pogue up. - What man? - His man in the department. - His ears. - That's bullshit. You're lying. Oh, no no. It's the truth. I swear. - Who?! - I don't know his name! All I know is it's somebody big. Just please-- okay, Malcolm. It's all right, man. You're off the hook. Hey hey hey, what about my stuff? - Man, you promised! - I sincerely hope this little consultation has taught you a valuable lesson... On the perils of narcotics abuse. Please. [ Whimpers ] [ Chimes ] Hi there. What do you want? - I wanna talk to you. - About what? US. God, Nick, there's nothing to talk about. Hey, wait a minute. Please? What? I'm thinking about getting out. [ Sighs ] It seems I've heard this before. Have dinner with me. I wanna talk about it again, seriously. You can't talk about anything seriously. Hey, I'm a jerk, all right? But a lovable jerk. Hey, you're killing my self-image here. You really are. Just dinner, all right? Please? I refuse to eat at El Maya. That's not a problem. A real restaurant this time. Okay, tablecloths, waiters, champagne, bathroom. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, I'm gonna regret this. What the hell? Man: Bring it back. Go all the way forward. And the crane. Beautiful. Class up. Hai. Thank you. [ Tooting ] [ Jazz playing ] [ Honking ] This man is serious. How do you like that shit, speedball? [ Brakes squeak ] [ Crane whirring ] [ Screams ] Hmm, a.T.C. You know, Nicholas berzak, sometimes you are not such a jerk. What? Sometimes... - God. - [ Chuckles ] I've got a great idea. Let's go back to your place, get naked, and then screw ourselves into unconsciousness. You're so romantic. Couldn't you be just a little less direct? Yeah, sure. We'll go back to your place, - get naked... - [ Laughing ] ...have some champagne and some strawberries and then screw ourselves into unconsciousness. Oh god, how could any woman resist when approached like that? Well, believe it or not, some have. I'm just kidding. Actually, you are the only woman I've ever cared about in my entire life. God damn it. It's the wrong credit card. - Listen, baby-- - you want me to drive it up? Yeah. Just be a second. [ Laughs ] [ Screams ] Teresa! [ Beeping ] - Nick, Nick. - Frank. Jesus Christ, man. What happened? I heard about Teresa. Is she okay? Yeah, she's gonna be okay. What happened to you? Two dudes in a semi tried to squash me. Nick, I just heard what-- Jesus Christ, frank. What happened to you? What the hell is going on here? A couple of guys tried to kill him with a semi truck. Somebody-- and I'm not saying it's decosta, okay? --Somebody's after our asses. Are you guys getting close to something here? Yeah, death. Larry, we need to keep this really quiet, all right? There's a very big deal going down tomorrow. It's on the east side. - Where on the east side? - We'll find it. - A.t.c. Transport. - See? A.t.c.? Boy, there's a lot of activity out there. How we gonna know where the deal's going down? - Check out the limo. - What limo? Berzak: That one. Frank: I don't see any limo. You don't see that limo? - Frank: Oh, I see it. Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah. - 30' long. - Okay okay okay okay okay. - Jesus, frank. Let's go check it out. Mm-mmm, no, you're gonna start blowing everybody away. We need a low profile. I'm going. - You cut me to the bone, frank. - Right. Just keep your eye on the limo. Yo! [ Whistling ] Shit, I can't see the damn limo. Hmm. Come on, move the goddamn truck out of there. No, the fucking limo is gone. Son of a bitch. Frank, get in the car! Why? What happened? The limo's gone! Would you mind telling me what the hell's going on? I think the limo's in that fucking truck. What the hell are all the black-and-white units doing here? Must be our leak in the department. This is not comfortable, gentlemen. I'm in the same kind. - Deals on wheels. That's pretty slick. - Yeah. [ Siren wailing ] Police, police! Pull your vehicle over to the right. Pull your vehicle over to the right, and freeze. Frank, I told you-- don't say freeze, man. It only pisses them off. I can't get a shot off. Berzak: Get in the back, frank. - What are you gonna do? - Just get in the back. All right, trust me. Check's in the mail. Okay, get ready, frank! Okay, you son of a bitch! Pull that truck over, god damn it! Now! All right, come on out of there, you son of a bitch. All right, get down on the ground now! Spread your legs out. All right, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Yeah, that's what I thought. Watch your head, fighter. 10-4, good buddy. Let's get on down to shaky town. You know how to drive one of these things? We'll find out. - Oh, gross. - [ Frank laughs ] Hang on back there, decosta. ♪ We're so glad you made it ♪ ♪ we're so glad you made it. ♪ [ Honking ] Man: Move up, move up. That's good, that's good. Get those civilians out of here. - Frank. - Let's go. Come on, sport, out. You are completely surrounded. Place your weapons at your feet. Put your hands behind your head. - Man: Stand back. - Man #2: I got it. Drop the gun, asshole! Put your hands behind your head! Get down out of the truck. Let's go! Move it! Over there!

Want some coffee? [ Laughing ] Holy shit. You guys always gotta make a big splash, don't you? - It's a nice case though. - Yeah. - Congratulations, guys. - Your black and white units rolling on the warehouse-- what's that shit? Nick, I swear to god, Ferris told me specifically-- yeah, uh-huh, right. We think Ferris is the leak in the department. What? [ Chuckles ] Hi, speed. - Where have you been? - Working. Did you get him? I'm really sorry, baby. I didn't know he'd hurt you. Think I'd feel any better if he hurt you? Come here. Oh, god, Nick, when is all this craziness gonna be over? I just want it to be over. Soon, baby. Really soon. Woman over P.A.: Attention, please. Visiting hours-- - Nicholas, Nicholas. - Yeah, mom? - When did you get here? - Just now, but I've got to go. Where are you going this time of night? I got a little unfinished business, that's all. I love you, mom. I love you, baby. [ Buzzes ] Yes? Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary. Who is this? It's the wind. And nothing more, only this. Nothing more. Manny, check the main gate. [ Groans ] Yeah, quoth the raven, asshole. Hey hey hey hey hey. That's really good. Right there. Very slowly pull your hands away from the weapon. Good. Put your hands behind your head now. Interlace your fingers. Hey, doll, do me a favor, would you? Take his piece, thumb and forefinger.

You don't answer your phone anymore? Huh? I'm about to be suspended without pay, man. You're lucky decosta didn't file criminal charges. What, you're telling me how lucky I am? Fuck you. Whoa. I just talked to Teresa. She'd like to see you. Oh, what do I say to her? "Hey, baby, I'm sorry I almost got you killed." She was right to throw me out. I'm just bad news for everybody. So what are you gonna do? Just walk away? - Yeah, maybe. - What about decosta? He's clean, frank. Haven't you heard? Why don't you stopthis? Oh, man, why don't you just go to hell? Hey, wait a minute, man. For four years you've been bugging the shit out of me about decosta. You hammered my love life, you took away my weekends, you've been a fucking pain in the ass, Nick, but I hung in there with you because you're my friend. We're partners. Hey man, nobody gives a shit, all right? So why the fuck should I? Because it's more than just decosta. We were set up by one of our own guys. You gonna walk away from that too? They fuckedus, Nick. And I think we ought to oblige them and return the favor. Miranda Sullivan, American civil liberties union. I'd like to see the transfer authorization on a suspect-- - kettlebaum, ira. - Yes, ma'am.

Don't play dumb, asshole. They're not playing dumb, Nick. Drop the gun. Drop the gun! How could you let this happen, kaminski? Just shut up, Harry. Jesus Christ. Kaminski? - I'm sorry, Nick. - What about US, Larry? You two get to die heroic deaths, shooting it out with a big-time drug smuggler and Ferris the dirty cop. [ Chuckling ] I'm sorry. I really liked you guys. Hold it, Charlie. Hold it right there. Nick! Frank. No no no. No no no no, man, no. I'm showing the man the view. Oh god, I am so glad decosta's behind bars. I don't have to hear your mouth about decosta anymore. I am so happy. Outside of breaking every rule in the book, damn near getting me killed, booze on the job, you guys cracked a pretty big egg. Well, thank you, sir. - However... - Every time. ...your tactics are lousy. If kaminski hadn't folded and spilled his guts, we still wouldn't have a thing on decosta. I'm sorry, sir. You guys are good cops. Well done. Well, thank you, sir. Thanks, captain. Nice stuff. I've gotta give up this business. This is-- - what? - I was just talking to myself, sir. - Have a nice day, captain. - Yes. I always liked him. Nick, you are so full of it. I swear. Hey, I did. Besides that, I figured he was clean the whole time. [ Laughing ] Bullshit bullshit. Oh, excuse me. - After you. Jesus. - Jesus. You know, I'm gonna miss you, speed. Hey man, I keep trying to tell you. Private investigation, all right? You got your own hours. You're your own boss. It's very happening. You're so full of it, I swear. Can't bullshit a bullshitter, can I? - Nope. - All right. I'll see you later. Take care of yourself. Okay, man. Come on, speed! Lake arrowhead's gonna dry up. I'll see you later, Teresa. - Have a nice time. - See you, man. - Both of you. - Okay, baby. Frank: Bye. Hi, darling. Let's get out of here. Mrs. Berzak over phone: Nicholas, it's your mother. Listen, I don't understand why you think I'm out of my mind if I wanna go to arrowhead with you and Teresa. [ Beeps ] Nicholas, it's me again. I'm sorry I got angry. But when a son can't talk to his own mother, I don't know what to-- [ Squeaks ] Nicholas, I am not a well woman. [ Jazz playing ]
