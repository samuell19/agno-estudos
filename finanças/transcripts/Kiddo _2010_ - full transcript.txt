Hey, just wait over here. OK. Hi. Hey Matty. So you are really quite 11 now. Hmm. No, I'm 12. You look a lot like your older brother. I really don't think so that I look like him. Yeah. I'm go make coffee. Hmm but it is it's really good to see you. Yeah. I'm sure I will see you soon. OK. Bye. Hey. So you remember what I said you after school yesterday well you know stuff can be nasty, right. Yes of course. But I didn't know your sister was back home. You have been going for a while. Yeah. You get a little girlfriend now or something? What? Come on, you can tell me. You know I'm down here during the weekend to watch you while mom is away but it isn't going to be... I have to tell her anything like that. Come on, get on. It's me your big brother, you remember. Yeah. Just watch and see. Why are you staying in the guestroom? Where were you? I was hanging out with some girls. Cool. It's good to see you follow your big brother footsteps. Yeah. Say this weekend do you wanna go fishing or you know catch up? Hey Matty, isn't about time for school? Come on, go get. Hey Matty shouldn't you be heading. Hi, is Kevin here? No. He is left. Do you need a ride? Hey just hit me out when you need a car. OK. I feel you are pretty high right now. Yeah, I guess. So like you do it when she asks, right? Yeah probably. So than it's OK for when I told you go out with her? Ashley said she won't go to the movies unless stuff came too. Matty. Matty! Hey there little guy. How did... the date go, you had a good night? He better had been with me tonight? Fine. I guess, it went neat. I had a couple of beers tonight, I hope you don't mind. Don't tell mom. You look exactly like your older brother. How cute. What are you doing? Uh, nothing. Just. You are kidding right now. You killed me, you know that. We talk about this later, uh. So angry, so what was that all about? We should get up. What are you doing? Nothing. Oh. You are not my friend Laura. Yeah, I'm. I'm planning a rosebush Matty. I'm. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm. You are just too young to understand. Hey. Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about, this morning. I will pretend it never happened. OK. I like that. You know Kevin isn't home, right. Yeah. I come not to see Kevin, I came to see you. I'm not so naive as you may think I'm, you know. I know. It's just when I was your age things were very different. You are not that much older than me. Uh, Matty. I hate it that I'm always being compared to you. I don't think I'm just like you. It's not that bad being like me, is it? I mean it is all right. It is just if I had a change up there you know. Well, it is not a bad thing. Hmm. You mean you didn't have to come around everything is regular. Why am I even talking to you. I don't care what you think. Fuck. I know you hate me right now, but. But, but. I'm your big brother. You are my big brother. And for what it is worth, I don't think you are very much like me at all.
