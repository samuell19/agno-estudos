Come on, Charlie. We made it. You were right, Charlie. There's bound to be some water.. In there somewhere. AHH! Ahh-Aah! Aah! Aah! Helmsman! Ahh! Ah. Good morning. Coming to, M'ling. You won't get any medals, but you do look better. Who.. Who are you? The name's Montgomery. Charlie? The other man? Yes. Yes, is he... He is all right? We buried him. Oh, God! Died of thirst and exposure. You're the lucky one. How long have you been adrift? I... uh... 17 days? And nights. You sure? Well, no. No. You're a seaman. Engineering officer. Lady Vain? Yes. We broke our back in a storm and sank in minutes. What is this place? This place? Paradise. Just where on earth is Paradise? Slap in the middle of the Pacific ocean, Exactly 1,000 miles from nowhere. Exactly. We haven't met, officially, that is. I'm Dr. Moreau. Andrew Braddock, sir. From the good shipwreck Lady Vain. Ship's engineer officer, adrift 17 days, lying here for 4. Thank you, Mr. Montgomery. Mr. Montgomery runs this establishment. I own it. Let's have a look at you. 17 Days. Remarkable how the flesh re-asserts itself. This island, it is on a scheduled run? Well, there hasn't been a ship in some time. So we're due. Meanwhile, we'll find some way to keep you amused. At least you have books here. Oh, you're a reader, are you? What else is there to do at sea, except tend to engines and stop fights? Well, you'll find we have an excellent library. How long have you been here? 11 years. It's truly amazing how the flesh re-asserts itself. She belongs to Dr. Moreau. He wants to know if you're feeling up to dinner. I can see you're up to it. Tell me... What kind of animals are there on this island? All kinds, lad. All kinds. Ah, Mr. Braddock. Maria, this is Mr. Braddock. Look up, Maria. Mr. Braddock has come to stay with us for a while. Has he come for your work? No, just till the next ship arrives. Is dinner ready, do you suppose? Shall I see? Please. She's certainly very beautiful. Yes, extraordinary. It pleases me to have her dress the way she does. She didn't wash ashore, too, did she? No, I brought her here. I found her in a crib in Panama City. At the age of 11, any man could have her... for the price of a dozen eggs. You still find her beautiful? Yes. I'm no moralist. Good. She's a very delicate creature. She's had some bad experiences. By the way, Mr. Braddock, now that you're up and about, you must never leave the compound after dark. Why? What's out there? Oh, just a jungle island. We haven't had a chance to explore it just yet, But one of these days I hope to find the time. There's been much talk about flying machines. Although so far, no one's been able to get. More than a few feet off the ground. But what they have done is to go underwater, in a craft that can stay submerged for hours. Just a few months ago in Bristol... How about man? The developments you speak of, are certainly not to be ignored, but how about man, his development? We know how and why an engine works, but one-celled organisms are more complex, more mysterious than the most sophisticated machine. There's been enormous advances in technology, but how much in man? I haven't seen any. You haven't exactly looked in the best places. I've looked where I've been. Mr. Montgomery was a mercenary. Still am. Whoever pays the most. I'll say good night. I have much to do. You say there are all kinds of animals on this island. Well, what kinds exactly? I'll strike a bargain with you, Mr. Braddock. When you require a drink, my quarters are next to the gate. When it comes to questions, you save them for Dr. Moreau. Good night. The servants here, are they from this island? Nobody was here before Dr. Moreau. What do you mean? He brought everyone here? Yes. When I saw you, I thought he brought you, too. Are there other islands nearby? I think so. How far? I don't know. You haven't been off this island, have you? No. There's no boat. But one does stop? Sometimes. How often? When did one call here last? Not long ago. And you saw it? No. Dr. Moreau told me. I never saw it. Why? He didn't let me. Was he afraid you'd leave? I couldn't leave. I wouldn't live anywhere else but here. What is your name? Braddock. Andrew. Good night, Andrew. Good night. "Moreau, Paul, Born April 12, 1851. "Boston, Massachusetts. "Doctor of Chemistry, Physiology, Anatomy. "Showed brilliant promise in his early monographs... on his cellular structure and growth." Is that what you're looking for? I was curious. "His most significant contributions... "were made before the age of 30. "But his work was severely criticized by Academicians... "as being highly speculative... and insufficiently documented." Exactly 44 words. Severely criticized by Academicians and actively opposed by his colleagues. Too often, men of visions become outcasts. My books, The Distillation of Man's Experience on Earth. Immortality in the Soul, The Nature of Good and Evil. The Physical Universe. And here... Eugenics and Inheritance. Why is one flower red, another yellow? Why is one man tall, the next one short? I hope I'm not boring you, Mr. Braddock. Oh, no, no. I'm fascinated. Please. Let me show you something. Embryos... A dog, a mouse, a human. They look almost the same. They virtually start out the same. A bit of protoplasm, a nucleus, A chain of chromosomes. Yet, we all know what they turn out to look like. Why? How does a cell become enslaved... To a form, to a destiny, it can never change? Can we change that destiny? Should we? Good night, Mr. Braddock. Good morning. Good morning. Beautiful. Oh! I found her. I found this. Come in. Have you seen Dr. Moreau? It's company you're looking for? It's here. Have a drink, lad? No, thanks. Don't reject my hospitality, Braddock. I don't extend it very often. Now, what else can I offer you? The man who serves us dinner... M'ling. Yes. I saw him in the jungle drinking water, except he wasn't drinking it, he was sucking it up. Local custom. But the way he did it, the way he looked. He... he was crouched down on all fours. I told you, local custom. Moreau will tell you all about it. As I said before, Moreau will explain anything. I'm just another servant. If you don't like it, why do you stay? I sleep better here. Not well, but better. Take him away. Mr. Braddock, you've seen something... I didn't want you to see. That was M'ling, wasn't it? Yes, yes. What happened to him? What happened to him? I'm not sure I know. I mean, ultimately, I don't know. Well, why shackle him in chains? I'm exhausted. I've been up all night. We'll discuss this later. But what about.. What about his face? In your engine room, things are predictable. You control them, but my work is always elusive. It doesn't always provide answers, just more questions. What the hell have you done to him? M'ling is a very special human being. And I simply wish you to know... I'm trying to help him. What happened, Mr. Braddock? What's wrong? I... I was chased. Chased? By what? I don't know. Something. I couldn't be sure. Who are those creatures? What are they? How many were there? 2, 3, Maybe 4. I don't know. What in God's name... Control yourself, Mr. Braddock. We better have a look around. You go back to the compound. That way. What were they?! What in God's name do you do in here? Don't worry, Braddock. You'll get over it, just like I did. Tend to the horses, Mr. Montgomery. This... This creature, what is it? See for yourself, Mr. Braddock. It's a bear, is it not? Bear? It's not possible. Whatever it is, it's in pain. What have you done to it? Mr. Braddock, when you first came to this island, I was apprehensive. I was sorely tempted to set you adrift again, but the idea offended my sensibilities. Then I saw that you were intelligent and curious, ...virtues of the scientific mind. I'm not sure you'll ever understand... what I'm about to show you, but I find myself wanting to. I have proved, almost proved, the existence of a cell particle, that controls the living organism. This cell, this particle, controls the shape of life. This is the second stage of the treatment of this creature. This serum contains the distillation of a biological code message, a new set of instructions, erasing the natural instincts of the animal. Some surgery implants, into various organs, and he should grow to resemble any creature we please. In this case, a human being. God almighty. You see? The serum is already forcing a modification of the body. AH! AH! But why do you do this? For what possible reason? Why? To reach control of heredity. Think what we can do for humanity. The pain we can ease. The deformities we can avoid. The possibilities are endless. Those women, those servants... even they... Animals, yes. So is that. AH! Stop it! Nothing's wrong. It was perfect, but he's still an animal. Get Montgomery. Get Montgomery! Montgomery! You are human. You are human! Montgomery, what is that up there? AAH! Man. It is a MAN. It is a man, like us. Like us, he must learn the law. What is the law? Not to walk on all fours. Are we not men? Are we not men? What is the law? Not to eat flesh. That is the law. Not to shed blood. That is the law. What is the law? Not to go on all fours. That is the law. What is the law? Not to hunt other men. That... Stop. Law has been broken. He who breaks the law shall be punished. Back to the house of pain. Back to the house of pain! This Master, he is as I am. If you do not obey him, he will punish you. His is the hand that makes. His is the hand that hurts. His is the hand that heals. His is the house of pain. His is the house of pain. His is the house of pain. I think I understand what you're telling me, But these things, these creatures... Well, they're human. Hardly. Human enough. For what? Pity. PITY? Understanding, consideration. Ah, yes, consideration. And I haven't considered them? They've been lifted, chosen above all animals, been given speech, The beginnings of society, laws. Laws so you can control them. You have no right. Right? There have to be feelings. Feelings. Is that what your heart tells you, ship's engineer? Does it ache for my poor creatures? You may recall that the human heart is no longer considered the seat of emotions. Except by simple-minded lovers. It's an organ for pumping blood for preserving life. We discovered that, by invading the temple of the body and chopping it apart. Whereupon science was considered to be ruthless, cruel, savage, but we did learn to deal with heart disease. Those bodies were dead before dissection. Animals are put to death for the same reason. These aren't animals, not anymore. Exactly. They're touched with humanity, with some of the noble virtues of humanity... rage, anger, hatred. I want no part of this. Homicidal hatred. You've given them something to hate. Do you want to live? Do you? Then they must fear you as they fear me. You have no choice. I told you a supply ship will be coming, but not for two years. Yes, two long years. So like it or not, you're one of us. And if you wish to survive, You will have to behave as one of us. Sometimes I rise above my ambitions. Mostly I fall below it. I bring them to within a hair's breath of being human, almost give them human form, feeling, thought, speech. But always in the end, almost always, They revert to what they once were... lions, bear, hyena. I've suffered many disappointments, but I've learned to wait, to watch. And in the end, I will succeed. Understandably, they fear this place, the pain they suffered. And when they revert, they bring back, into their brute lives the memory of that experience, their human legacy. In the image, of our own species, they become vengeful killers. Now do you understand? Do you? If they spill one drop of blood just once, it will drown us all. Ready, doctor. Mr. Braddock, There's something I'd like you to see. Hardly resembles the creature who attacked you in the cave, now does he? What will you do to him? Take him back to the cave. Either they'll take him in or they'll eat him for dinner. They'll take him in. Have no fear. Coming with us, Mr. Braddock? No, thank you. He is man again. It is well. No! Not well! Better as animal! Strong! Proud! Not this! This is human. This is man. His law! Ours! No, his! Our law! It is our law. Are we not men? Are we not men? This is law. There. It's nearly finished. With some food and water, And with each other, we'll make it. There's bound to be a ship out there somewhere. Where would we go? Home. England, eventually. What would I do in Eng... Eng... England? Be with me. I'm afraid. You don't really believe I'm a sailor, do you? It isn't that. It's... Moreau? I couldn't live anywhere else but here. But why? Why do you keep saying that? This is the only place I know. Braddock! You're coming with us! You'll need this. No. Now do you see? You'll have to join us. Where is the sayer of the law? Say the words. What is the law? Not to go on all fours. That is the law. What is the law? Not to hunt other men. That is... What is the law? Not to shed blood. One of you has broken that law. Who? Who? Who among you has shed blood? He who breaks the law Goes back to the house of pain. He who breaks the law... Goes back to the house of pain. Back to the house of pain! None escape! None escape! NONE ESCAPE! NONE ESCAPE! Follow me! FOLLOW ME! Follow me! FOLLOW ME! Follow me! Over here! OVER HERE! No house of pain. Kill. KILL. His is the hand! HIS IS THE HAND! HIS IS THE HAND! They don't seem to like you, Braddock. AH! AHH! You can't understand, can you? Don't let him suffer. I can't help that. Please. Maria. I forgive you, Mr. Braddock, for wanting to escape. I hope that you will forgive me for what I'm about to do. For the time being, you will find it impossible to move or to speak. Neither will be necessary. All the work that I have done brings me time and again to the same barrier. No matter how far I take my creatures, they begin to revert. But they can't tell me what's happening inside their bodies when that occurs. Until now. You will do that for me. You will explore that inner battlefield, that war of the cells, and bring back the knowledge, the ultimate knowledge to become an animal, to feel it inside your body and your brain, what no man has ever known before. You will bring that back to me. AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH! AAH! AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH! What have you done to me, you bastard?! What are you doing to me? Let me go! LET ME GO, BASTARD! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME. GET OFF ME. YA-AAH. CHRIST! You've been drinking for two days, Montgomery. I suggest you continue. Let him up. I said let him up! If one is to study nature, One must become as remorseless as nature. You should know that. Who's next, me? Unlock those chains or I swear I'll kill you. All right, Montgomery. Keys. In my room. OH! AAH! OH! Your mental processes are changing. The way you think is changing. No. You're beginning to think in images, concrete images. Hot, cold, light, dark. Food, hunger, pain. I think... as I always did. Words are becoming meaningless to you, Except for the most elementary command. No! See, it's happening already. NO! NO! NO! You've lost control. You are an animal. You are the animal! He tells us not to kill, and yet he kills. You haven't eaten in two days. You must be hungry. To eat, you must do so like an animal. Never! You've already entered the first stage. Your instinct, not your mind, but your instinct is to tear, to ease your hunger, to fill your belly. Try. Go on, try. AH! AH! Soon enough, it will become natural to you. I was born in Bolton, Langshire, England, on the 27th of March, 1881. I have two brothers, Philip... and Robert. Robert died in a fire. We used to go sledding in the winter. Yes, there... there was a hill that... that ran down from the railway station to the lake. The lake was called... Barrow lake. The wind... The wind coming off the lake, it was so cold, it used to freeze ice to the runners of our sleds, to our hands, to our faces. Oh, Bobby used to laugh. He liked that. He laughed. He laughed. I ... I forgot that. I.. I thought I'd forgotten that. I.. I... My... My first book... was A Christmas Carol. No. No. It was The Sea Cook. Now, you see, I remember it all. I remember it all! I REMEMBER IT ALL! Damn you, Braddock. DAMN YOU! Let go! LET GO! Andrew. Andrew. Andrew, they're all sleeping. Get Montgomery. Montgomery's dead. Dead? Get the... the, uh... Get the... - Key? Key, yes. Moreau has it. Get a... Maria, help me. Where's Montgomery? We have him. Return him. I said return him! Repeat the law, not to hunt. Not to shed blood. That is the law. THAT IS THE LAW! He who breaks the law must go to the house of pain. Back to the cave! I created you. I created you. We... have killed. We have broken the law. No more law. No more law. No more law! We must have laws. We are not animals. No more laws! To the house of pain. STOP! Look... Look at me. I am as you now. NO! You Master. Must go to house of pain. HOUSE OF PAIN! Maria... Get gate. Animal. You're an animal. NO! UGH! NO. NO. Creatures of the law, He is not dead! You can not kill Moreau. Yes... He sees you now, but you cannot see him. FEAR HIM! OBEY HIS LAW! SEE? SEE? HE IS NOT DEAD. HE IS ALIVE! HE IS NOT ALIVE. HE IS DEAD. NO. NO. DO NOT TURN THEM LOOSE. THEY ARE NOT LIKE US. AHH! AHH! AHH! DON'T! DON'T OPEN THOSE CAGES! IT WILL KILL! PUSH! PUSH! Andrew, watch out! Watch out! AH! AH! AH! AH! HEY! MARIA! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
