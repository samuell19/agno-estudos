PÜNKTCHEN AND ANTON based on the novel by ERICH KÄSTNER Just a minute. So. And now tell me something about Charlemagne the Great. Klepperbein. Charlemagne the Great ... Charlemagne the Great was great, as his name says: great. - So! A really great emperor. And you are a really great thickhead. Sit down! Maybe you know a little more, Klaus? Spaniards drove Charlemagne back when he tried to expand his empire. There was that thing with Roland too. - Good. Tell us what you know about that. Fritz! - It was like this: Charlemagne's army retreated over the Pyrenees, Spaniards at their heels. Charlemagne said to his mate Roland: "Guard this pass and let no one through." And Roland said: "You can rely on me. Get back safely to Germany and give my regards to my wife." The emperor's army set off and Roland defended the pass. That's what finally killed him, and Charlemagne became very famous. Anton! Anton. Goodness, Anton! Anton Gast! Please excuse me for waking you. You're staying here. Off you go, the rest of you. Anton, I won't put up with this any longer. You rush through your homework. Now you're falling asleep in class! What is up with you? You were always such a good boy. Are you ill? Are you lacking something? - No. I shall write to your mother. - Please don't, Mr. Bremser. I've put up with this long enough. Enough is enough. DR. MRS. VON BERLEPSCH'S PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR GIRLS Piefke, you shouldn't fetch me. You could so easily get run over. But next time there'll be a treat. He begs like that when I'm angry, so it's impossible to be mad at him. You cowardly chap! Are you coming to the football match? - No, I've no time. How boring. Four weeks now without a proper centre-forward. I'm just as good. -You like to think you are, dreamer. - There's Piefke! Yes, Piefke! - So your girl Pünktchen can't be very far away, either. I'll sock you one in a minute. There she is now, your Pünktchen. I just counted my buttons, to see if I'd meet you today. If teacher hadn't woken him, he'd still be asleep. - Stupid chap. Come, I'll walk with you a while. - That's why he's no time for footie. That Klapperbein is loathesome. - How do you know him? He's next-door's caretaker's son. - I see. Are you coming to the café? I can't. Mama is taking me out today. -Your satchel is open. Look, Papa's legs. These are new posters. Nice, heh? "Girl, if there's a man you crave, Pogge stockings will make him rave!" The other rhyme is even better. Papa made it up during dinner. "A connoisseur knows what's best: Pogge stockings pass the test!" Life's busy as factory manager then? - I see him only at mealtimes. I've more cigarette cards for you. - Thank you. The Missouri Valley Red Devils! Now my Red Indian series is complete. Were you up till late again? - Home at 1.30. - That's nightlife for you. Was your teacher very angry? Worst of all, he's going to write to my ma. Really? Tell him what's going on. No. I'd rather bite off my tongue. Piefke! Piefke's tree. You've a white mark on you, Sir. -Where? - It's gone now. Here, Klapperbein. Treat yourself. - Thank you, Director General, Sir. In 40 minutes, as usual, Sir? -Yes. Thank you, Hollack. G' day, Bertha. - Good day. -What's this then? Piefke's tree! Pünktchen's birthday present for him. No other dogs are allowed there now. What an imp she is. So what's up? Did anyone call? Any news? Ah, the mail's arrived. Where is my wife? - Madam is out shopping, as always. As always? I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Yet she promised to be on time. I've made a cheese soufflé. Is Pünktchen back already? That'll be her. Stop that ringing! I'm coming. How often have I told you not to ring the bell like that? Look, I have all the Missouri Valley Red Devils at last! Don't throw your satchel on the floor! Quick, quick, wash your hands! Why are you so late? Been dawdling again? Bertha says, you're a Mona by name and a moaner by nature. Can't you perhaps slim down a little? - Now, now, don't be jealous. G'day, Director, Sir. - G'day, Miss Andacht. Are you satisfied with Pünktchen? Is she obedient? Totally. When a child doesn't obey, the governess alone is at fault. A child shouldn't feel rules as such. It must feel glad to obey. Pünktchen's manners have improved a lot since I've been here. A proper little lady. "A connoisseur knows what's best: Pogge stockings pass the test!" What's this charade? "Girl, if there's a man you crave, Pogge stockings will make him rave!" Stop these silly rhymes! Silly? But Papa wrote them! Excuse me, Director, Sir. - Come to me, you clown. What's the news? - My molar tooth is loose. A molar tooth? Let me see. Oh yes. Does it hurt? No. I'll pull it out soon. -Your mother's not on time, again. You ought to teach her manners. - One can't say such things! - I can. Please, Director, Sir, my soufflé is about to collapse. If Madam doesn't arrive ... Then let's not wait. Let's eat. Come Piefke, jump! So, and now play Mrs. Pogge. Please send the gown over by 6.30. You can rest assured I shall. Taxi! Taxi! Hello, Madam. Don't you recognize me? It's ages since we saw one another. At least take a look at me! As unapproachable as you ever were. Enchanting. Lutz Höllriegel. I used to step on your toes in dance class. Now I remember. Lutz. - I'm delighted to see you. That you recognized me! -You haven't changed a bit. What's new in school? What is 3 times 8? - 3 times 8? 3 times 8 makes 120 divided by 5. Doesn't it? That's right. Yes, Pünktchen ... where are your cherry stones? - I ate them. -What? You ate them? - Pünktchen! Can't do any harm. My appendix was already taken out. Cherry stones contain prussic acid. There's Mama! -And prussic acid is very harmful ... - Bon appetit! ... for the human body. G'day, sweetheart. - G'day, Mama. Have you been good? -As always. G'day, Fritz. - G'day Eva. - I met an old schoolfriend today. He recognised me and drove me home so I'd be on time. On time, you say? - So let's eat now. We already ate. I have to go now. You didn't wait one minute for me! But never mind. I want to fast. I've put on weight. One can fast alone. Goodbye. - Perhaps it'll fall out tonight. What? - My tooth. - I invited him. Who? - Höllriegel. -Who's he? The old friend I just mentioned. - I see. Goodbye. What shall I wear? -Wear for what? You wanted to take me out today. Oh yes. But I can't, I'm afraid. I have a bad migraine. You promised on Tuesday already ... and you always have migraine. I'm sorry. But I really must lie down, so I'm fit tonight. More than 20 people are coming. Miss Andacht! Yes? - Can you please go swimming with Pünktchen? Fresh air and sun will do her good. Of course. -Your lunch is almost ready. No. Just an orange juice, please. Bertha, what is migraine exactly? A migraine is a headache, even when one doesn't have one. Piefke! How hot it is today. - It's good. Makes people drink lots. We're out of vanilla ice cream. - I'll fetch some more. There's a kids' party at the zoo on Thursday. Take the ice-cart. Fine, Mrs. Übelmann. No vanilla left! Have you something decent to wear? A white shirt? Yes. It's a bit small for me though. No matter. Open the collar and roll up the sleeves. Two double brandies! - Two double brandies. Can I go upstairs a while, to make my mother something to eat? Yes, but don't take all day. -When can she come back to work? The doctor says she should stay in bed a few days longer. A few days? I'll have the police on my tail for letting you work here. I want my money. -Well, I can't carve it from my ribs. I put my money on Breeze on Sunday, but he didn't even make the start. Don't be telling me fibs. It's always the same palaver. A different excuse every day. You'll get your money. Waiter, bring that over here. Let's relax over a brandy. - Relax? I want my money. Here comes your new girl. I presume she has a savings account. Not much in it though. - Then what do you see in her? She works for toffs as a governess. That must be good for something. There you are! G'day, Robert. - The young lady's paying me a visit again too, how nice. Isn't Anton here? - I just saw him over there. Have a look in the yard. - Enjoy your dancing. - Thank you. Shall we take a seat here? -Just as you like, Robert. - Please. Charming child. To have children from a beloved woman must be fine. Two eggnogs. But it's also a big responsibility, forming a character to be decent, decorous and morally upstanding. Morally upstanding. Quite the point. Shall we dance? -Yes, thank you. How often have I said, don't put the butter in the sun? Where is Anton? - Gone out for a minute. Where to? - Home. You want some too? - Thanks, but I don't use make-up. Will he mind me calling on him? Why should he mind? Tell him to get a move on. It's the back of the house, isn't it? - 2nd floor. - Thanks. Come, Piefke. I was supposed to go swimming actually, but ... G'day, Pünktchen. - G'day. Nice of you to come by. - I think so too. Weren't you supposed to go out with your mother? - Cancelled again. I'm cooking something. - Cooking? - For my mother. Well, don't mind me. I'll watch you. So what's on the menu? - Scrambled eggs and spuds. She's feeling better. Who? - My mother. She can go back to work next week. My mother's in bed too, as we're having company tonight. Look, my tooth is loose. - Pull it out by tying a thread to a door knob. -White or black? What? - The thread. -White. You put that much sugar in? - It's not sugar. It's flour. Eggs with some flour go further. Piefke, what are you doing? How stupid. -What's up? - It's gone lumpy. Put the gas on. - How much salt? A whole bag or just half? Half a bag would probably taste really nice! I don't have a clue about cooking. Bertha takes care of all that for us. You really think that's enough salt? - For sure. Oh, goodness! -What's the matter? The postman. I bet he has the letter from Bremser. - Bremser? My teacher. He's coming. G'day, Mr. Lampe. Anything for us? - No, my boy. In luck again. My heart is thumping. Carry on stirring it. With boiled spuds, you must be careful or they turn to slosh. What's your teacher's name? Brensel? No, Bremser. I'm an idiot. The letter won't arrive today. Is that done? It's perfect. I'm totally scrambled. It smells really good. Open the door for me, please. She looks ill, but don't let on. -Word of honour. So, Mama mine, some food at last. -Very sweet of you, dear. Thank you. And this must be Pünktchen. Anton told me lots about you. He told me lots about you too. How is your good health? You are looking splendid, Madam. I'm not madam. I'm Mrs. Gast. Is it good, Ma? -Yes. But I'd like a little salt. I told him there was too little salt. Men always insist on being right. He looks so tired. It's not right for him to be working every night in the Sommerlatte. If only I could get up. Here, Ma. Thank you. Well, who's this saucy little dog? Say how do you do, Piefke. He's very well trained. Did you teach him that? Anton! I forgot to say, you're to hurry up. - I'm coming! Do you need anything else? - No, run along. Cover up and get some sleep! -Yes, Doctor. Come. - It was a lovely afternoon. Thank you and get well soon! Not that you need to get better. You seem to be in flourishing health. You think she noticed anything? -What do you mean? When I tell fibs, I sometimes lay it on too thick. The doctor says she needs a few weeks of mountain air. Doesn't she want to go away? Not want? You're joking. We haven't any money. It'd cost a fortune. About how much? -At least 300 marks. Put the lobster in the icebox. Shall I make the caviar sandwiches? Nonsense. Caviar has to stay on ice till the last minute. Help me, Miss Andacht. -Why's the hired waiter not yet here? They didn't want him here too early, so he'd not get under your feet. Thank you very much. - Pünktchen's swimsuit in the kitchen. That child is so untidy! Strange that it is dry. You were supposed to take the child swimming, weren't you? I'll take the child wherever I like. You take care of the kitchen. The child is my department. Department? What nonsense. Weak nerves? No wonder, the hours you clock up at night. What I clock up at night is none of your business. I'll clock you one in a minute. Just try it, you old goat. Miss Andacht deserves respect. You shouldn't give her backchat. She has one big failing. -Which is what? She talks too much. -Just like you. -And like Mama. You don't have an easy time of it with us women, Director. So! - Thank you, Miss. Oh, what a lovely gown! Pünktchen, do up the hooks, please. -You look like a princess. A little tight. -Where's that gown from? I never saw it before. - Do you like it? How much was it? - Oh, dirt cheap. 500 marks. Practically a steal. What's up? The first guests have arrived. - Fine, I'll be right down. Hurry, Eva. Goodnight, sparrow. - Night. 500 marks? That's a lot of money for a dress without sleeves. Hand me that box. That cost more than a trip to the mountains. Thank you. - Say, Mama, can you give me 300 marks? 300 marks? What for? I know some really poor people ... Most of whom are far from as poor as they say. I read in the paper that an old beggarwoman died, and had 30,000 marks in her bag. She earned all that by begging? Or selling matches. But that was only a pretext. 30,000 marks? Then why doesn't Papa go begging? That's only for lazy people. Now go to bed, child. Night, Mama. - Careful! You'll ruin my hair. Run along. Mrs. Pogge is being very attentive to that young man, don't you find? Who is this Mr. Höllriegel? A racing driver, I heard. -A racing driver? A fine image of a storm, is it not? What's up? A ladder? No, on the contrary, it seems to be a very snag-resistant weave. Excuse me, but I manufacture stockings. It's professional interest. Your daughter is 8 already? I can even prove it. Pünktchen is a big girl. Does she look like you? - I'll show her to you. But the child's already asleep! - No matter, she sleeps like a log. I'm coming too. I like to see children asleep. All of you come along! - Happily. I can't wait to see her. She's so sweet when she sleeps. And so well behaved. Matches, buy my matches, Sir. Just 10 pennies a box. Have a heart for poor people. Mother is very ill and still so young. Only 25 pennies for 3 boxes. God bless you, dear lady. Yes, Pünktchen, just what are you doing? I'm playing a beggarwoman. A fantasy! I told her about a beggarwoman - How original. Here, little beggar. For your piggy bank. - Thank you. Please buy one box for 1 mark. You're already more expensive. - Because of increased demand. Well, that's enough drama. Now go to sleep. The tablecloth. Goodnight. - Goodbye. - Pay us the honour again soon. So, we're done. - Here, eat this. It'll be dry by tomorrow. May I please eat the cake upstairs? All the same to me. - Thank you. But bring back the plate! - I shall. So, time to tot up the night, boss. - Now, where did I put the receipts? Here they are. - No. Those are from yesterday. Your chaotic till is terrible. Come! Sometimes 5 marks too few, or 5 too many. It always balances out. Morning. Morning. Here's the plate. - Help crush the ice. But I shall be late for school. - It can't go on like this. Your mother's ill, you never have time. I'll have to get someone else. Please don't. Ma will be back soon. I'll do it. Morning. - Morning. Liver sausage again! I think my wife has something against me. So, that's taken care of. I do hesitate to write such letters. But I can't avoid it this time. Falling asleep in class is taking it too far. - Morning. Such bad luck to have fine weather. I'll have to teach gym outside. That will bring on my sciatica again. Now, what is a girl doing in our school for boys? Pardon me. Are you Mr. Bremser? No, what makes you think that? Because you look serious and strict. I look strict, do I? Over there. That's Mr. Bremser. What do you want, child? So it's you. My name is Pogge. Could we talk in private? In private? If you like. It's about Anton Gast, who fell asleep. Oh, that lazy rascal? - He's not lazy. He works hard. That's something I've yet to see. I warned him and I was very patient. His mother is very ill. Oh, I didn't know that. She's laid up and can't do anything. But somebody has to cook. And who cooks? No idea. -Anton cooks. Scrambled eggs and spuds and the like. Simply fantastic. I didn't know that. - She can't earn money now either. But somebody has to earn money. Do you know who earns money? - No. Anton. You didn't know that of course. Not at all. He's slaving away night and day, so they have something to live on. He's even putting money aside, so his mother can go and convalesce, because the doctor said she needs to, to get better. Are you his sister? -A friend. Just think what would happen, if his mother got your letter. The fright would make her more ill. Why didn't he tell me all this? I asked him that too. He said: "I'd rather bite off my tongue". Do you know what this is? - The letter. Yes, the letter. And watch what I do with it. You're a good man. I saw that immediately. Thank you very much. I thank you, child. You've done me a favour. Don't tell Anton I was here. Not a word, I promise. And again, thank you very much. Here is France. And Spain is here. More or less. Rather less than more. Teacher, somebody knocked. - So. Come in! Excuse me, Mr. Bremser ... I must have a word with you, Anton. Come outside. -Yes. Now he's in for it. I'd laugh if they expelled him. You'd like that, because he's a better footballer then you. Who's better? Anton? He's a better gymnast too. - I can blow him off the high bar. Old show off! He threw him out. Poor Anton. - It serves him right. You miserable dog! Silence! I still feel queasy. The way Anton came running up the stairs. It's much nicer to help a friend without him knowing it. If I were mother, I'd have a migraine any minute. Hollack? -What? - I have a migraine now. A migraine? You've a screw loose. I don't know if it's possible, Robert, but I shall do all I can. But of course, Hermine. Pearl 2 to the right, 2 to the left, for 4 rows and then turn. It's a charming knitting pattern. No, I'm not crazy. Bertha just came by. I'll try to convince Mrs. Pogge to go for a stroll with Pünktchen. Goodbye. And don't drop too many stitches. Yes? Excuse me for bothering you, but I'm here on Pünktchen's behalf. -What is it? I put myself in the place of a child that would like for once to go out alone with its mother. There's a party at the zoo today. A kids' party? I'd like to take her there, but we were up so late last night. Pardon me, Madam. I was only asking. Hello, Pogge here. Yes. Oh, it's you: Lutz Höllriegel. Did you enjoy yourself last night? I'm glad you had a good time. I don't believe I can. I must take care of Pünktchen. But we could combine the two. There's a kids' party at the zoo. What a state! What tree were you climbing on? And you've long since grown out of this skirt. What don't you forbid me? Even washing. Egon, it's only out of love for you, yes, only out of love for you that I've drunk a glass too many ... Pünktchen, what's that horrible song you're singing? You're always dancing to it. No reason to croon it to your doll. Egon ... - Pünktchen! ... it's only out of love for you, yes, only out of sheer love for you, that I sank so deep ... - Pünktchen! The wet doll on the clean tablecloth! What are you doing? Leave that alone. We're going to the dentist tomorrow. Will you listen to me for once? One doesn't pull teeth with a doorknob. Ouch! It's out. Put on something pretty, sweetheart. We're going to the zoo. Really, to the zoo? I'm so glad to have you to myself. We should do this more often. - Then come and eat ice cream with me in the Sommerlatte, a wonderful café. My friend Anton works there too. - I see. How nice to run into you here. -What a strange coincidence. Why don't you say hello? - I thought he was about to leave. You should still say hello. -Would you like a balloon? Hello! Three balloons please. - Three? Here you are. I don't want him to come with us. We can't just leave him there. - But we didn't invite him. Pünktchen, don't be so rude. Delightful balloons! - Here, child. Aren't you pleased? -Yes. But come and see the hippos. You run ahead. -We were going to go together. - I'll be along in a minute. I wanted to see you before I leave. -You're going away? Yes. I'm the stand-in for Monaco. I have to go and train straight away. Now listen very carefully, children, to what I have to say. This hippo family goes about things exactly like you do at home. The fat hippo mother that you see here worries as touchingly about her child as your mothers do about you. She isn't pretty. Her waist could be slimmer. Her mouth is somewhat large. But her heart is in the right place. She takes good care of her young one, just like your mothers do. She gives him food and drink, and makes sure he bathes every day, because children get dirty quickly. And above all she makes sure that nobody harms her child. If this rascal threw the baby a cigarette butt, for example, she'd get really angry. She'd bite your leg off right away, you lout. - Get out of here, before I throw you out! What barefaced cheek! It must be wonderful in Monaco now. - It's a little hot. I love heat. - Then let me make a suggestion. Come to Monaco for the racing. I can't possibly. -Why not? There's nothing to it. Actually you're right. My husband always wanted to go to the South of France. -Your husband? Yes. He really needs a rest. Understandable, for a businessman. But will he take time off? I hope so. I'd really like to go, for the motor race alone. Mama! Come, you must see the hippo. It's so sweet, Mama! In a minute. I'm talking. Come, here's some money for you. Buy yourself a nice ice cream. Now she's sad. - Oh, she'll get over it. Children, today the weather's nice, so buy yourselves an ice cream. Enjoy it. Anton, you here? - G'day, Pünktchen. -A vanilla ice, please. How's business and what's new? A strawberry ice cream please. I was late for school today. - No! I thought I'd be expelled. But Bremser was suddenly all nice, like a father. So I told him that Ma is ill and all. I don't need to go to school until she's better. And then he'll give me extra tuition for free. I don't understand why he's different suddenly. -Yes, it's mysterious. Pünktchen and Anton, the new German lovebirds. Did he tell you they threw him out? - I've been informed. The dream of being centre-forward is over now. - So you play that now? For sure. Who else? Have a pleasant afternoon! You wait. I'll let you have it. -Who, me? Anton, harder! You show him! You rotter! You were asking for it! Stop! - Do you surrender? Yes, I surrender. Coward, he's scuttling off now! The winner on a technical knockout: Anton Gast! Hurrah! Only buy ice cream from Anton, the great sportsman! You do that well. The car has never been cleaned so thoroughly. When I marry, I'll do it all myself: washing, cooking, darning stockings, having babies. 10 or 15 of them at least. Fifteen kids? You need piles of money for that. Then again, you are rich. You could afford it. Why are there poor and rich people? You ask some difficult questions. - Pünktchen! Mr. Hollack, have you seen her? Pünktchen? No, I haven't seen her. No idea where she might be. - Same old business every night. Impossible, to put that girl to bed! So, that got rid of her. - Tell me, why isn't everyone rich? It's so unjust. - That's true. But what can one do? Would you give Anton half of all this, if you could? - Of course! Why not? You say that now. But you'll think differently, when it belongs to you. I certainly won't. If I was an adult, I could prove it to you all. Prove what? - Nothing in particular. Come. One, two, hop. I thought you were long since asleep. - I wanted to say goodbye. Night, Mama. - Careful, my dress. Night, child. Have fun, Director. - Thank you, my pet. I don't want to hear any complaints. - I'll do my best. Night, sleep tight. Pünktchen! Youth is wonderful, in happy times, youth is wonderful, and is gone forever. So I shall say it once again ... Pünktchen! You gave me a fright! - I didn't mean to. It doesn't matter. Do you want a cuppa with me? No, thank you. - No? The days of youth are wonderful, youth is wonderful, and is gone forever ... Pünktchen! Do you know where that child is? I look after my kitchen. The child is your department. She wants to go out every night, but the rest of us have to go to bed. What are you doing? Nothing. I just wanted to hand you the tea caddy. Nice of you. Climb on the chair, or you won't be able to reach it. So I'll say it once again, the days of youth are wonderful, youth is wonderful, it is gone forever. Won't you have tea after all? No, I don't want to make Miss Andacht mad. When she comes looking for me, tell her I'm already in bed. But you always wanted to go South. - But not in the heat of summer. Well, I'm a summer person. -A night-owl party person, rather. What about Pünktchen's holidays? Simple. She'll go away with Miss Andacht. Oh, do come along. Do. Impossible, Eva. I can't just abandon my factory. Matches, buy matches, dear lady, only 10 pennies a box. Here, child. - Many thanks. Matches, matches. Have a heart for us poor people! A scandal, this begging. Watch out that the police don't catch you. Buy matches! Poor child, you should be in bed. - Only the rich can afford to sleep. Give her 2 marks. - 2 marks? -Yes. Here. - Many thanks! -You can keep the box. Don't you need any matches? I'd rather have schnapps. Only 10 pennies. Don't bother me with matches. When I say schnapps, I mean schnapps. I'm afraid I haven't any schnapps. Take matches instead. Did you understand a word I said? Damn little toad! What's this, out alone at night? - I'm not alone. That's my pa. That one? That's your father? He's drunk. - Like every night. Shall I take you home? - No thank you. I live nearby. But take my father with you, or he'll beat up my ma again. He beats up your mother? Poor child. You're coming with me. Have to get home to my old lady. I bet you do. That's just what I want to prevent. Night, Pa. Buy matches. Only 10 pennies a box. 223 portions of ice cream. Why, you did a grand job. The weather was very good. That's why the zoo was full. 2 espressos, 1 vermouth and soda. From tomorrow I can work all day for you. I'm off school. A first-class cigar. You've spent too much money on me again. Nothing's too expensive when it's for you, Robert. What a hustle and bustle again. I do so long for my own home. Evenings by the fire, just you and I ... I didn't know you were a homely sort. - Enormously homely. I dream of a little villa. -A villa for the two of us? Why not? I've already talked with an architect. But we're still debating the plans. You said the Pogges' house is pretty. How are the rooms laid out there? -Well, downstairs ... Can you maybe make a sketch of it? When you come in downstairs, the vestibule's here, and there is the study ... I don't need too many new things for Monaco. An evening gown at the most, and two tea-gowns. I saw an enchanting one in a fashion magazine. I'll show you. Then just a few light things. And a swimsuit. Or perhaps two. That'll do. There's not much going on now in Monaco. It's no fun down there in this heat. -Apropos heat: a beach suit. But you have two from last year. - They're out of fashion. Where did I put that magazine? - On the hearth table? - Not here. Leave it until tomorrow. No rush. There's a big car race down there. Now, that would be interesting. Oh, that doesn't interest me. I'd really like to see it. A pity that you don't have time. - Indeed. Did Andacht take my fashion magazine ... Is she interested in fashion? Well, she's a woman after all. I have to get up early again tomorrow. Now I know where the magazine is. In the ironing room. Oh, shut up about the silly magazine. I shouldn't have eaten so much goose liver. Heavy on the stomach. Where's the bicarbonate of soda? In the bathroom. I'll fetch it. Oh, you found it already. -Yes. It was here. Look, this is the tea-gown. Isn't it enchanting? I find the cut particularly pretty. -Very pretty. So sweet, your gift of a trip for me. I haven't even said thank you. Hello, what's this? Pünktchen's tooth. She gave it to me this morning. She favours you rather than me. It was you she gave her appendix in spiritus, too. Oh, the things you come up with. That's nonsense. 40, 50, 60, 70. 10 marks 70. Not bad for starters. So, Piefke, go to sleep now. Please, I'm in a hurry. - Be right with you. No thank you. No need of pre-shave lotion. There ... thank you very much. Pay us the honour again soon. A shave. - 70 pennies, please. G'day, Mr. Habekuss. - G'day. A haircut, please. -Very well. And how's your mother? A lot better now, thank you. I can't say the same for our bills. -And for young Miss? I'm just watching. But perhaps you can do me a favour. Businesses need small change. Can you change this for a 10 mark note? Certainly. Same as last time? -Yes, please. The back short, longer in front; 20 pence now and the rest on credit. That's very kind of you. Piefke! Not on Anton's jacket, Piefke. One shouldn't leave a jacket lying around. One should hang it up. Men are so untidy! There's a button missing. - It's in the pocket. Keep still or I'll cut your ear off. Oh yes, here it is. Anton, I don't understand you. Why are you so slipshod? You must sew the button on. - I shall. But today. The minute you get home! Yes, all right. - She's a strict little miss. She'd be no fun as a wife. - She has her good sides. Sir, how can I help you? A shave, please, right away. But Sir, we're not yet finished. Strange customers, Mr. Habekuss. Hello. Will it take long? Please. I'll be right with you. Please take a seat. It'll take only a few seconds. Mr. Habekuss is in the fine phase. But we can pass the time away. Can you sing? Sing? Why? No. A pity. We could all four have sung a round. Can you recite a poem? Why should I recite a poem? - Oh. You can't? What about handstands or somersaults? What? So you can't do anything. Like all adults. We're meant to do it all: gym, arithmetic, singing, go to bed early, somersaults. Adults don't have a clue about anything, however. There, my boy. - Thank you. Not at all. Pay us the honour again. You're crazy. Ma, you're up already? How are you feeling? A bit wobbly on my legs, but otherwise quite well. What? Are you going to sew? Yes. A button's missing. - Do you have it? I'll do it. -You're incorrigible. Not up a minute and back at work. This isn't work. It's fun. -You must rest! - Give it here. Where's this money from? No idea. The note didn't put itself in your pocket. It's a mystery to me. Anton, please tell me the truth. That is the truth. I don't understand it myself. You didn't ... because I'm ill, and you wanted to help, you didn't ... - Steal it, you mean? Go to Mrs. Übelmann. - I won't give back what I never took. Then I'll go myself. - Please don't! Why? If you're innocent, it can all be cleared up. Cleared up how? You know the chaos in Mrs. Übelmann's till. And you exploited that fact! I'm so ashamed! Ma! Ma! Back on your feet? -Yes, thank you. I'm fine again. Hello. - Back already? Anton said you'd be back next week. You still look a bit pale to me. I'm here because of Anton. That's a boy you can be proud of. I was so against him working here. - Can you change 100 marks? But I'm lucky I had him. He's honest, decent. You're moved, I see. You should be too. All that he's done for you! I'm to tell you the man with the wine bill is here. That crook. I'll give him a piece of my mind. Where's Mrs. Gast gone? - Back upstairs. A schnapps, please. What a change in her! She was always in such a good mood. An illness like that does you in. 10 marks too much again. You'll never get rich that way. G'day, Mrs. Gast. -Yes, Pünktchen! You look brilliant. So fresh, perky and cheerful. Is Anton home? Come in. G'day, Anton. Where is he? Anton? He's gone. That silly boy! For 10 marks! I'd have got by. - The 10 marks in his pocket? -Yes. I put the money in there secretly, at the barber's. What? The money was from you? Oh, I've done the boy so wrong. My God, how unhappy he must be. I hope he won't do anything stupid. I'm so afraid something could happen! Stay here. Our chauffeur is here. We'll look for him. Hello. Is that the police? I'd like to ... What's up? Anton's gone? Why's that? I don't know. She said she'd done him a terrible wrong. So, I should wait in the flat. You'll let me know? All right. Thank you. Ma! Ma! Anton! My Anton! We've got him back! I did you so wrong. - Ma, it's all right. Don't get upset. I don't know how I could have thought that of you. I shouldn't have run off. You're not still angry with me? - No. I'm so happy you're back. - Slowly, Ma. Don't overdo it. I thought my heart would break when I saw you'd gone. I was so worried about you! I was inconsiderate too. But no. It was only natural. As long as you don't get ill again. - Oh, I won't. I'm so happy. Come, Piefke. Let's make some coffee. Lucky Pünktchen was here. -And where is she now? We forgot all about her. Pünktchen! -What is it? Come on up! I'll come tomorrow. My parents are expecting me. You've a face as long as a fiddle. - Oh, it's nothing. Nothing. Why are you in the back seat? Don't you like me anymore? Oh no, I do. Mrs. Gast really does love her Anton. That's very good so. No reason to be sad. Do Mama and Papa love me that much? - Of course they do, child. What makes you think they don't? They never have time for me. Only Miss Andacht is waiting for me. But your father has such a lot to do. His enormous factory! But Mama has nothing to do, yet she never has time for me either. How come my matches keep on disappearing? You're acting as if somebody might have stolen them! But Grandma, why is your mouth so big? All the better to eat you! So, then you have to eat me. You should eat me, you daft dog! Pünktchen! How unhygienic, to have the dog on your pillow! And my spectacles! -Your headscarf too. You are quite impossible, Pünktchen. Sorry! - Director, Sir. - Good evening, Miss Andacht. What's this, child? In bed already? Go to bed early yourself sometime, it'd do you good. Actually I wanted to talk to you about something. Spit it out, Director. It's about the holidays. You know Mama is going to Monaco. No fun in this heat. Now, that is Mama's business. Maybe you'd like to go to summer camp with girls of your own age? No, I shouldn't like. - It would be more fun than travelling with Miss Andacht. I want to stay here in the holidays. Spend the summer in the dusty city? Anton is here. He's on holiday too. Can I bring him here sometimes? Bring here whomever you like. - But Miss Andacht forbade me to. Since when did you obey her? - That's true. Fritz, I'm ready. Where are you? Goodnight, sweetheart. Sleep tight and sweet dreams. -Will do. And think it over again, will you, the holidays? Goodnight. - Night. Ignition cable's loose, I can see that at a glance. Can you give me a cigarette? You'll get it back tomorrow. You know what you can have from me? A good slap, if you don't get lost. -A man can ask a question, can't he? Good evening, gentlemen. - To the opera, please. You've a white mark on you. -What, again? He's putting you on. - Don't bother me again. You don't have even one ticket left? - I'm afraid not. - Such bad luck. But the film runs until next week. Well, Miss Bertha? - Oh, hello Constable. Full? - It never works out, when I look forward to something. A pity I'm on duty, or we could dance a boogie-woogie. You're a man who likes his pleasure, Constable. I'm terribly sorry, but there's no chance of it tonight. I'm longing for you. - But I can't leave the child alone. Pünktchen is no longer a baby. What could happen to her? It's not like someone will break in. Are there valuables in the house? Just the jewellery. And the director has a lot of cash locked up in his desk. In the study on the right. - How do you know that? You told me how the rooms ... But make up your mind. I've had a bottle of bubbly put to chill for us. Then I'll just grab my bag and my hat. Matches, gentlemen, only 10 pennies a box. 3 boxes for 25. Buy my matches! You're helping out a poor child and its sick mother. Thank you. I'll eat my hat, if you're not Miss Pogge. - Eat it then. I am not Miss Pogge. - Pünktchen, don't put me on. Pünktchen? What kind of name's that? Unheard of. Quiet, Piefke. -All right, cutie-pie, hand over the dough. You must be stark raving mad. If you don't hop it, I'll tell Anton. You know what you'll get then. Let him come, your little bridegroom. Give it here. Ouch! Damn dog! Come Piefke, good dog. Come here. Yes, you're so brave. Come. Take a bite. -Where, what? Oh, I see! I'd quite forgotten that a colleague is expecting me. Can't you just call him? No, we've a big deal lined up. For the sake of our future, darling. - Nobody was ever so sweet to me. So you be sweet and wait here. It won't take long. Yes, yes. Director Pogge's residence. No, the family's at the opera. This is their cook. Oh, fat Bertha. This is Anton, Pünktchen's friend. You can expect a visit any minute, a burglar. A burglar! - He stole Miss Andacht's key. Holy Moses. What shall I do? Don't be afraid. I'm on my way, and I'll bring the police too. And if he gets here before you? Then strike him down with a fire-iron. Afire-iron? Fine advice. We have central heating. METROPOLITAN OPERA Director, Sir, I've news for you. That rascal again. - Get out of here. You don't yet know what's up. Read this and you won't send me away. "Dear Mr. Pogge, your daughter is out selling matches". Selling matches? -You understand? - No, not a word. What are you saying? -Where is Pünktchen? A tip-off must be worth 20 marks to you, General Director, Sir. Excuse me please, but I must open the door. The police are here! - I only need a dustman. Matches, buy my matches ... Pünktchen! -Yes indeed. There she is. Pünktchen, my poor little Pünktchen! What on earth happened? And what are you wearing! How did you get here anyway? Your stockings are completely torn. Mama, don't cry. Papa does have a stocking factory. You'll make me ill. -What's up? -A family tragedy. Come, Eva. Let's get home, child. The things you get up to. Come, Piefke! Leave that little girl alone. - This is my business. You put that little girl down now. -What? This little girl is my child. No fairy tales. I know who this girl's father is. A drunk, who beats up his wife. - Me? I beg your pardon! I'm speaking about the father. - But I am the father! You? The father of this poor child? Believe me. This is Director Pogge and this is his daughter. You let her run around the streets at night? -We knew nothing about it. And who are you again? - The mother. So, the mother. And you knew nothing about this either? - No, nothing. Don't get over-excited, he's usually very friendly. Then you can take the child with you. -Very kind of you. Thank you. Piefke! On your way, please. Do you know these people? - Sure, they're close friends. I'm from the press. Perhaps you can tell me a little. A little? I can give you a novel. But it'll cost you a bit. When will the Black Maria arrive? - Give them another call. I want to speed them up a bit. I don't see why you're in such a rush. It's cosy here. - So, gentlemen. How about a drop of spirits? - It's turned into quite an evening. Yes. We've our own detective film now, homemade. Here's to your speciality! -All we need now is some music. Not so loud! You'll wake Pünktchen. You surely know that we love you. -You don't need to beg for money. We don't refuse you anything. -You do. Mama refused me 300 marks. Oh yes, I remember now. But I didn't take you seriously. What did you want the money for? - For Anton. The boy you talked about? -Yes. He's poor and hasn't a father and his mother is ill. I wanted to help, so she can go to the mountains and get well again. My handkerchief is wet. - Here, have mine. - Take mine. Which one should I take? - Both. One for each eye. What happened? -A burglary. -What? - One moment. No entry. I live here! - That's another matter. What's going on, Bertha? Are you engaged to a policeman? This young man tried to break in, but I whacked his bonce for him. That's Robert! You know him? - It's Miss Andacht's fiancé. What? - Miss Andacht's fiancé? -Yes! Pünktchen, what happened to you? There's Anton! Without the boy it would have ended very badly. This is my friend Anton. You must get to know him. He's fantastic. He's just how I imagined. -We are deeply indebted to you. Oh, I didn't do much really. What's going on? Afire? Robert! Did you pay for the bubbly? - No. I'm terribly sorry about that. And I ordered my wedding dress today. Hard luck. Perhaps you can make a summer frock from it. - Or even two. Well, that's that. Now go and confess it all to the Pogges. No. I couldn't bear to face the Pogges ever again. As you like. -Where shall I go? What shall I do? - To family? I've a sister in the country, with a chicken farm. - There you go! Chickens suit you better than children do. We need a new governess immediately. - No, we don't. What? You don't want to keep Miss Andacht on? From now on I'll look after the child. -You really want to? -Yes. How about you taking a holiday? We could go with Pünktchen and ... Papa, Mama, come on! What's keeping you? We're coming. You'll sure sleep well tonight. - It was an exhausting day for you. Who'll give me a pillow? - Take mine. - Take mine. I'll take one from each of you. If only Anton's mother were well again! Don't worry. -We'll take care of that. You will? -You can depend on it. I've never been so happy in my life. Please, Mama, never imagine again that I love Papa more than you. I love both of you the same. I love you both very much.
