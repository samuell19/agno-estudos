(lively music) (dings) (dings) (dings) (beeps) (dings) (dings) (dings) (beeps) (dings) (beeps) (dings) (beeps) (door knocks) What do you want? (bangs) I said what do you want? (dramatic music) (rips) Oh. (smack) Ah! (Smacks) (woman moans) (laughs) (woman moans) Y'all come back real soon, hear? [Announcer] That was this weeks episode of "The Forceable Intruder". Now stay tuned to USTV one for the latest adventures of "The Newly Weds". Viewers are reminded that the special rebroadcast of the critically acclaimed BBCC program. (slow eerie music) (beeps) (fast bouncy music) (beeps) [Man] The time is 07:35. The temperature in the city is 19 Celsius with a high in unprotected areas to reach 21 today. Mass trans systems are all functioning on schedule. Today is a class A work day. (beeps) [Man] Cindy, come in the bedroom now. [Cindy] I always do something that gets me in trouble. Come on in, Cindy. I thought you were getting better. But it was only an accident... I don't want excuses. You promised you wouldn't be so clumsy. You know what your problem is? You've no self-discipline, no self-control. I promise to do better. I'm sure you will because I'm going to help you. It's my duty as your husband to teach you what self-control is and we're starting right now, get undressed. (slow eerie music) (beeps) There we go, that should do that. (moans) (upbeat jazz music) I'm leaving for work. Fine, I'll see you tonight. I wanted to talk with you... Shh, I'm watching this. Don't you ever get tired of just watching TV? [Sam] Why should I? Well you could be doing something else. (moans) Look, I'm a good union member. I work my three months out of the year like the contract says. I'm entitled to my time off. You like the money coming in each week. Just 'cause you're stupid enough to ask for a nine month work year, don't take it out on me. (glass bangs) See you tonight. (heavy breaths) (calm music) (phone rings) (swoosh) (beeps) (phone rings) Please deposit three credits for the first five minutes. Thank you, go ahead. I wanna castrate men. Cut them all up, use a big, sharp knife. I imagine I see all these big, strong muscle guys strapped to tables and I can hear them screaming and screaming, and I walk up to them and I take my knife and I slash their neck right through their belly and they keep screaming and screaming. (slow dramatic music) Screams and it makes me feel so good inside. And then I go to the next one and the next one and it's always the same. I always get them. Then, then I grind up their arms and legs into meat and package it in little squares. (beeps) Your five minutes are up, would you like to continue? No, thank you. You're perfectly normal and I found what you had to say very interesting. I think you did the right thing in telling me like this and I know you feel better. Oh yes, much better. Of course, this will be our little secret and you can come back any time you like. Thank you, I will. (phone rings) Please deposit three credits for the first five minutes. (upbeat techno music) It's really starting to get to me. What, the job? That and everything. Why don't you request a year of recreation? After all, you really deserve it. You've been working for almost seven months straight. That's not the answer. I'd just be sitting at home with my husband watching television day and night, and that's one of the things that's starting to get to me. But Julie, everybody watches TV, I do. Yeah but every minute that you're not sleeping? [Beverly] Well if you're not on a work schedule, why not? What else is there? Well I wanna do something or go somewhere. I know what you mean. Like going to a pleasure center. Gee, who wouldn't wanna do that? But you can't go just any time you want, you know that. You've gotta win a trip in the lottery. I know, Beverly. I get my ticket each week like everybody else. But that's not really what I'm talking about. Why can't I just go for a walk? Go for a walk, to where? Not anywhere, just walk for the sake of walking. Boy Julie, you are really weird. I'm beginning to think so. (dramatic music) (gasps) Oh am I glad it's you. [Woman] I came as quickly as I could. [Julie] I'm sorry to call you out like this, but I need help. [Woman] Well what kind of help? I'm about to overload. I feel like I'm the only person that sees how empty our lives are. How controlling and pointless. [Woman] Now just calm down. I've tried but it's no use. How can people spend their entire lives just eating, sleeping and watching television? Oh but that's a great plan, don't you see? The government found out that sex and violence was what the people truly wanted. And then scientists found out that sex and violence wasn't really harmful to viewers, but rather was a great pacifier, eliminating tensions and anxieties. The only trouble was it turned people into voyeurs. Passive, easy to manipulate oh which was just fine with the government. But that's my problem, I can't stand being passive anymore. I just wanna rip things up. I wanna pull plugs, short circuit wires, bend, fold, staple and just mutilate. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. As your cell leader, you did the right thing in calling me. But you must not do anything rash. The reason our underground movement has been able to survive is that we wait patiently until our actions can accomplish big things, not petty nuances. You're right, but it's so hard. I know. Look, just go home and try to relax. And someday, hopefully soon, we will all be able to strike a great blow for freedom. Trust me. Hi honey, glad you're home. Come watch this with me. You just in time for one of my favorites, Trudy Sharp from Birkley Park. It's set back in the 70's. All those porn operas look same to me. Well nostalgia's big this season. This is one of the best. [Announcer] When last we saw Trudy Sharp, she was on her way to her weekly meeting of her woman's lib. (laughs) Isn't that funny? Remember woman's lib. [Announcer] But the unexpected arrival of a magazine salesman changed her plans. Why don't you just make yourself a little more comfortable? Actually my partner will be coming by in a minute. I'll just wait for him outside. (slow music) Wait a minute buddy, you're not going anywhere. What do you think you're doing? You'll see soon enough. Now, take off that coat and tie. Come on. Sam, I want a divorce. Really, why's that? Why, because I just don't feel-- Hold it just a second, this is good. See these? Play with them. Look, I usually don't this kind of thing. Well you will today. In fact, you'll do exactly as I say if you know what's good for you. Come on. That's all right. You got two good hands, use them. Come on, that's better. Please, why don't you let me go? Not yet, now take off that shirt. Isn't that something? It's just not working. It's not your fault and there's nobody else. I believe you. - Then you agree? - Of course. [Julie] Let me have your card. - Huh, oh yeah. - Your card. Here you go honey. Honey, would you get out of the way? [Trudy] Now stand up, take off the pants. (beeps) (triumphant music) (beeps) [Computer Voice] Computer central. Connect me with the Civil Affairs Bank. [Computer Voice] One moment please. (beeps) Proceed. This is Julie Clayburg, 951643350. I wanna divorce. [Computer Voice] Please insert proper cards. (beeps) (beeps) Divorce granted. That's good, but you're gonna have to do a lot better. Unless you want me to start to work on that pretty face of yours. (slow music) Pretty good, huh? A lot of guys say I'm the best there is and you're going to get a chance to find out for yourself. This way. All right brown baby, let's get down to the nitty gritty. Off with the shorts. Please don't make me do this. Off with the shorts. Well, let's get with it, hot shot. I don't have all day. I just, I just can't. Oh yes you can. I don't wanna have to get ugly. I'll just help you a little. Yeah that's better, that's better. [Julie] It's all been taken care of. You've been reassigned to a sheltering in the Mercury complex. You can leave tonight if you'd like. (moans) Let me finish just a couple more shows and I'll leave then. (moans) [Trudy] Yeah, yeah. Well I'll be seeing you around. Of course, sure. (moans) Well, well you're waiting to leave, I'll go for a walk. Goodbye Sam. Good idea, see you around Julie. A Walk? (intense music) (helicopter blades buzz) Stay exactly where you are. You are under surveillance. We repeat, do not move. Stay exactly where you are. Who are you and what are you doing? I'm Julie Clayburg, I'm just walking. Just walking? What is your social identification number? 951643350. (beeps) Prepare for voice print. Go ahead. I'm Julie Clayburg, 951643350. (beeps) [Man] Voice print confirmation positive. Julie Clayburg, 951643350. Age 26, graduate B central socialization center, graduate new sound defense service institute, graduate North American University, 91 class A work assignment, exceptional CPT ratings.

We had to check you out. After all, your behavior is not exactly normal. I know. But as a confessor, I guess you know what you're doing. Thank you. [Cop] If you hurry, you won't miss the late news on television. (eerie music) (beep) (beeps) Hi I'm Cherry and I'm the first prize in the Love Lottery. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's that time again, the even all America anxiously awaits. The weekly drawing to see who will be the lucky individuals goes in to spend the week in that fantastic achievement of technology, the Pleasure Dome. But before the actual drawing, let's take a trip via the television camera to the wonderful magic kingdom of of delight, just as the joyous winners will receive. A trip I for one never tire of seeing. Winners will travel to St. Louis via transcot in a monorail, then be quickly whizzed outside the city to the Pleasure Dome itself. The most exciting recreation area the world has ever known. Completely staffed by amazingly human like androids, the Pleasure Dome offers endless possibilities for total excitement. The entire complex is under the watchful eye of a scientific genius who prefers to remain anonymous, but sits in his master control room and reaches out bring joy to the countless guests of his dominion. The entire amazing area's controlled by the fabulously expensive RK1600 computer, reputed to cost over seven billion credit. Various amusements and attractions will fill the seven day stay for the fortunate winners of this never to be forgotten vacation. And now for the big moment, our own computer here in Washington will select the number sequences. (beeps) And there it is viewers. (beeps) (dramatic music) You're only the third member of our group to win the lottery. Well happened to the other two? Well we gave them a dangerous assignment and they didn't return. That's why I hesitate approaching you now. But it is a chance for you to strike that great blow for freedom we discussed. Well, what do you want me to do? Two others have failed. What is it? Once inside the Pleasure Dome, we want you to destroy the RK1600 computer. Oh, is that all? It's the most expensive computer in the world. It would take them months, maybe even years to replace it. They'd have to shut down the entire Pleasure Dome. Be impossible to keep it a secret from the people. That's for certain. And once the world hears that there are some individuals that are resisting the complete dehumanizing affects of government regulation, our cause will sweep the nation. The Pleasure Dome is the best symbol of the government doing everything for the people. Don't you see? Oh but it is very dangerous. What would I have to do? This locket contains a solid charge of jellified explosive. Simply depress the stem after removing the chain and three minutes later, you'll have a tremendous explosion. Well, it sounds simple enough. That part is. The hard part is getting into the RK1600 room and planting it. The outer layer of the computer is the most protected. There's a service panel that leads to the core of the computer. If you can place this charge inside the shell, it will be powerful enough to destroy the entire inner workings. Oh then I just walk and not run to the nearest exit. You don't have to do this. I've always wanted to be a trend setter. You'll be a hero for the entire movement. Well just don't start the celebration til I get back, if I get back. (dramatic music) (lively music) Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is the Pleasure Dome. Please come up to the reception desk so that you may begin the most fantastic week you've ever lived. (beeps) [Master Control] Welcome, welcome, welcome. Our reason for being here is to please you, our guests. Your wishes are quite literally our commands. You simply have to make a request, no matter how simple or elaborate and it will be done. I urge you, let your imaginations run wild. Let your creativity reach new bounds. The more we at the Pleasure Dome can please you, the more gratified we are. Let us waist no more time in getting you into the fantastic sensations which make up the Pleasure Dome. In a moment, you will meet some amazingly human looking androids. They're called Pleasure Units and function as electronic slaves to our guests. They will do your bidding and act as guides and servants. Pleasure Units throughout the dome wear blue bands on their wrists to identify them. As guests, you will be given golden bands to wear as a symbol of your power. Have a fantastic time and thank you again for coming. We will be working constantly to please you. (beeps) That was the voice of Master Control. He is the idea, the very spirit behind our organization. There is nothing he can not provide, nothing he can not accomplish for you. (beeps) Now let us give you your slave units. (warps) (beeps) [Woman] Excited to be here. I can't believe when they told me I won the lottery. (beeps) Your personal belongings have already been taken to your quarters. The first event of your stay with us will be a test of your personality drive so that we may better serve you. If you will follow your guides down the concourse, they will escort you to the test cubicles. (warps) (beeps) (beeps) Group M05 has arrived and is processing in test cubicles. (whoosh) (eerie music) [Computer Voice] Welcome, welcome, welcome. Please sit down. This simple test is to help us determine what events and past time to arrange for you. The answers give us a look into your inner most drive and desires. Relax and respond openly. Please take the computer card you will find next to you and follow directions completely. (beeps) Playpen YB rigged and ready. Guest prepared. (beeps) [Master Control] Request programing of interface components. Requesting preuse of deck 39, sensory play. (beeps) (slow intense music) Allow guest to enter playpen. (door squeaks) (bangs) Well, I hope you're comfortable. You have the best room in the house, you know. Still afraid to talk, huh? We'll see about that. I've come to give you your daily exercise. Be ashamed of what a perfect specimen like you get out of shape. Now let's see some tricks, sit. Sit I said! Sit boy, now sit! That's very good, now lie down. Lie down. Okay now roll over. Come on, roll over. (slow charming music) Now that's good, now up, up. Come on, get up. All right now stay, you understand? Stay! (beeps) I don't know why I even waste my time with you. Maybe someday you'll be worth something. (bed creeks) (breaths heavily) You pig! How dare you? I didn't say you could get a hard on. You bastard, how dare you disobey me? I'll teach you what you really are, nothing but filth. Got me all out of sorts, I must rest. Oh you really think you're something, don't you? Think you can make love to me? You're not half a man. I bet you don't even know what a real man looks like, do you? But I feel sorry for you. I'm going to do you a favor. First you gotta show me your worth. You wanna make love to me? Well, come over here and beg me. Come on, beg me. I said beg. That's good, that's very good. But it's not good enough. (man grunts) (whip snaps) (whoosh) (whoosh) (dings) (whoosh) Welcome, my name is Shannon five and I am your personal pleasure unit. You will be staying here while you enjoy the Pleasure Dome. Through that door are toilet facilities, including a sonic massager and infer shower. Also a complete line of hallucinogenics and consciousness drugs. But we have a communal playpen devoted exclusively to chemically altering facilities, which most guests prefer to getting high alone. This control unit gives you access to me at all times. With the added facility to activate the view screen and to contact personal services centers. Should you be hungry or thirsty, simply make your selection with this serving cube and it will be delivered to you. At the Pleasure Dome, we also have our own two TV channels that offer some highly interesting programing, which you may find entertaining. Is this where it all happens? Well, your wish is our command. You may order any number of pleasure units to satisfy your desires and certain portable items can be brought in also. But at the Pleasure Dome, we have countless playpens each devoted to a specific fantasy or background. And of course if you find nothing to your liking, Master Control will arrange especially to your tastes. Oh I don't think I'd be that much trouble. No, guests are never ever any trouble. We are here to serve you. Perhaps you would like to freshen up while the results of your test profile are being processed. If you need me, I will be outside. Simply press the pink button on the control panel. (whoosh) (slow bouncy music) (beeps) (alarm beeps) There is a slight drop in power across grid section H. Efficiency only 93%. [Master Control] I will reroute my way to the carrier coils, stand by. (alarm beeps) (beeps) (dings) So you see Miss. Clayburg, in your case the test was unable to detect any concrete pattern. A very rare occurrence indeed. We are going to have to rely on your conscious mind for ideas to enhance your visit here. Do you have a particular request? Not really. [Master Control] There must be something we can do for you. As a child, did you have any favorite daydreams you care to relive? Or perhaps a past romance to be restaged? I'm sorry I'm no help to you. I'm just so tired and I have a slight headache. [Master Control] How thoughtless of us. Of course the trip must have been fatiguing. A nice rest period will work wonders. I will send a special powder to your serving tube. It is of exceptionally high quality and two sniffs will bring you blissful sleep. When you awaken, your mind will be fresh and eager for the adventures awaiting you, good night. (beep) (slow eerie music) (dings) (mechanical buzz) (sniffs) (mechanical buzz) (alarm beeps) Report. - One of the units, Trace 29 is not responding to his programing. [Master Control] Exactly what happened? As near as we can tell, he smashed some equipment and left the dome and is now in the countryside. All attempts for conditioned response have been negative. [Master Control] Feel all information into security bank. Yes sir. [Master Control] I will activate Monitors. (beeps) (eerie music) (alarm beeps) (rumbles) (alarm beeps) (cricket chirps) (slow dramatic music) (alarm beeps) (eerie music) (heavy breaths) (dings) (man screams) (beeps) (lively music) Did you have a good rest? Oh yes, I did. Excellent, if you'd like to get dressed now, I'll show you some parts of the Pleasure Dome. This might help stimulate your imagination. Oh, that's a good idea. I will prepare you some food. (elevator beeps) (elevator dings) Level 14 B, please. I'm taking you to one of our most popular attractions with both men and women. It's really quite fantastic. I didn't know you were taking me outside. Ah, but we're not out of doors. This is inside the dome. You're kidding. No, this is a specially projected sky to give the illusion. It's necessary to remain enclosed in order to ensure perfect climatic control, come. You're familiar with the old sport of motocross racing. Well this is very similar with a couple of acceptions. Our guests have come to call it killer cross. But the official title is cross country dash. Why do they call it killer crossing? You will see in a few minutes. Let's move over here where we can get a closer look. (motorbike engines buzz) Come, we can see the action better on the view screen. (motorbike engines buzz) (dramatic classical music) (woman yells) (gun bangs) (woman screams) (motorbike engine revs) Look, there's another one. (woman screams) Do you see those small blue buildings over there? If a pleasure unit can reach those, he's safe from the guests. It adds a little extra challenge for the riders. (motorbike engine revs) (woman screams) I think I've seen enough. (woman screams) Very well, there are lot more fun things I have to show you. Doesn't it bother you watching what's happening out there? But Why? They're only machines. But... You're right, they seem so lifelike. I just, I keep forgetting. (alarm beeps) Playpen red D rigged and ready. Guest in place. [Master Control] Allow guest to enter playpen. God dame, would you believe this? (beeps) Hi, I'm Sandy. I'm here to take care of your body. No shit. What can I do for you, cowboy? I come to get a massage. I figured that, what kind do you want? You mean there's more than one kind? Of course, there's the regular, the special, the extra special, and the most expensive, the super deluxe French executive blast off. That's the one for me. I always had a hanker to be a executive. [Sandy] Really, do you wanna get that one on? Does a wild bear shit in the woods? Whoa, let's do her. [Sandy] You're the boss. Well I get the things, why don't you show your colors? Begging your pardon ma'am? [Sandy] Your shorts, I don't think you'll be needing them. - God dame. That's fine, now let's lie down. You won't be needing this either. Now let's get down to business. (bouncy country music) How about a little whipping cream for a starter? (whipping cream sprays) Doesn't that feel good? Boy howdy, things are starting to look up now. A little chocolate syrup. Man oh man, if the boys in Florida could just see me now. Shredded coconut. [Cowboy] I just don't believe. Little more. I just don't believe it. Chopped nuts. Begging your pardon ma'am? Bit of chopped wall nuts. [Cowboy] Oh wee. And now to top it all of, a cherry on the top. And away we go. Begging your pardon ma'am. Well, the dame thing looks so good, I decided to eat it myself. Excuse me. (slurps) Marge, you wanna come see this one? (beeps) [Announcer] Will guest Paige Beaker please answer yellow page phone on the green concourse. I'm sorry you didn't find anything that might interest you. How are you feeling? I'm fine, just a little headache. I didn't mean to cut your tour short. Never apologize to a pleasure unite. It's not necessary. Now wait here a moment if you'd like. I can get you a drug over there. (beeps) (alarm beeps) I apologize, that was my fault. Only pleasure units are allowed in that section. I should never have left you alone. What was that thing? They are monitors. Very few guests ever see them. They provide security for the Pleasure Dome. What's back there? Just mechanical and electronic support facilities. You mean like the RK1600? That's right. Here's something for your headache. You best return to your quarters now and rest. Just rest inside a few minutes. I'll be right outside. (whoosh) (slow calm music) (beeps) (sighs) (alarm beeps) Guest Thompson is ready for processing at maroon W. [Master Control] Please come in, Mr. Thompson. Don't be afraid, Mr. Thompson. You're going to enjoy this. Our test has given us a great deal of information. So we set this playpen up just for you. Look in front of you. There is a view screen and control. Why not turn it on? Your favorite music is on the recorder. Why not play some? Now just sit for a minute and watch the view screen. (calm bouncy classical music) Yes Mr. Thompson, you are watching one of our pleasure units made up just like the girls in those Neo-Victorian novels you love to read secretly. There are several from which to choose. Simply change the channels. (beeps) Take your time. Observe them as long as you want and let me know if you find one to your liking. (beep) (beeps) (beeps) (beep) (dings) You've made a choice, Mr. Thompson? Very good. Simply leave it on the channel you want and press the button on the table in front of you and the girl is yours. (beeps) [Woman] Playpen blue I rigged and ready. [Master Control] As you must have come to understand Miss. Clayburg in your job as a confessor, there are tremendous anxieties in guilt stored up by individuals in our society. By giving our guests the opportunity to purge themselves of all their frustrations and suppressed desires, we make them happy, more productive citizens. I understand. [Master Control] Your training has given you a certain detachment from the darker aspects of human personality, even in yourself. Therefor I feel I must urge you to participate in some of our attractions. But I really don't... [Master Control] Please, hear me out. It is our job to make your stay with us pleasant and rejuvenating. Once you get started and let yourself go, you'll find new dimensions to yourself. Please, allow Shannon Five to escort you to the passion pit playpen. (eerie music) The passion pit? [Master Control] Exactly, it will be an attraction a young woman of your interests and education will find extremely stimulating. I'll talk with you further upon your return. Have a nice play. (beep) [Shannon] Will you change into these and come with me? (elevator beeps) (elevator dings) Sublevel black, please. This is as far as I go with you. A pleasure unit will be waiting for you outside. (cricket chirps) (slow dramatic music) (car engine revs) Hiya kid, I'm Spike. Hop in. (upbeat jazz music) You know, you're a pretty groovy little chick. Oh thank you. Soon as the flick starts and the lights go out, we'll get down to a little (claps) action. (triumphant music) There's something I have to tell y'all. Everybody listen. There's an ulterior motive behind being invited here tonight. We're all under arrest? (laughs) Wrong. The motive is that I know everybody here slept everybody else, more or less. Roughly speaking, come on, admit it, I know it right? And that everybody's gonna go home and get balled one way or another. But somehow you're another and I think since we're kind of intimate friends, we outta get into it right here and right now. Okay? Okay, no objections? Okay and no rules except that there should be no jealousies and nobody get uptight and no negative feelings. And so I think we should dig in. And also I think so because it's my party. And this is more or less what I had in mind, so everybody just dig in. - Sure. - Sure, I can't get out of here. My clothes won't come off. I'm stuck in my earrings. Now this is my kind of movie. (woman moans) (woman laughs) Come on snake, let's crawl. What does that mean? I mean like, we could teach those creeps on the screen a thing or two, couldn't we mama? Let's watch the movie, okay? Well what a drag. I brought you here to get (claps) a little action. You know, I've always wanted to try popcorn. What the? Well you know what they say, a movie is not a movie without popcorn. Oh man. Spike, phase? Sure little mama. Give us a kiss for luck. (lively jazz music) (moans) How's it going, Alpha nine? Got a real board with me. Now she wants popcorn. I'll get some. She's a real pain in the old transistors. Good luck. (woman moans) (lively music) (car door bangs) Here's your corn. (woman moans) Fascinating, you know this is really very good. Wanna try some? I'll tell you what I want, mama. (paper crinkles) Come on, don't be such a goodie girl. I know you want it as much as I do. Let's get in the back seat, what do you say? Wait, wait a minute, listen. Wait a minute. You're right, I do want it. But do you know where I'd like to do it? Where is that? Not in the back seat, but in the trunk. You flipped your wig, chick? In the trunk? Now that's impossible. I bet you could do it anywhere. Well I ain't saying I couldn't cut it. But in the trunk? Man that's pissville as far as I'm concerned. Oh come on, for me? All right, all right. Let's split for the trunk. (car door bangs) You sure you wanna do this? Positive. All right, help me push some of this junk around. You know this might be a gas after all. (bang) (lively music) (cricket chirps) (motorbike engine revs) (dramatic music) (bang) (explosive bang) (Julie screams) (bang) (beeps) [Announcer] Keep arms and hands inside the elevator. You are being returned to central core area. Congratulations on your escape. (eerie music) (people talking at the same time) Attention for a special announcement. Turbo lips in the blue concourse are temporarily out of service. Please use purple lips in green and yellow concourses. (alarm beeps) One of the guests, Julie Clayburg, has reacted irrationally by locking her pleasure unit in the trunk of a car after attacking him. Her profile shows no inclination to violence. She is now missing but believed to be in central core section. [Master Control] I will activate the monitors and immobilize the pleasure units in the area while they sweep security. (beeps) (beeps) (whoosh) (slow eerie music) (alarm beeps) Monitor sweep reveals, guest Clayburg not to be in central core area. [Master Control] Move sweep to red grid. Reactivating pleasure units. (rapid beeps) (alarm beeps) Monitor sweep reveals guest Clayburg not to be in blue grid area. (beep) [Announcer] All pleasure units are ordered to report to their primary processing stations immediately. All pleasure units are ordered to report to their primary processing stations immediately. All pleasure units are ordered to report to their primary processing stations immediately. (rumbles) (radar whoosh) (slow intense music) (alarm beeps) Monitor sweep reveals guest Clayburg not to be in upper support levels. (rumbles) What are you doing here? You're not to go in there. You're not normally assigned to this sector, are you? You'll have to come to the processing station with me immediately. I repeat, you'll have to come with me. [Shannon] They're only machine, they're only machines, they're only machines, they're only machines. (bang) (computer rumbles) (clank) (metal scrapes) (slow intense music) There's no computer. [Master Control] That's absolutely correct, Miss. Clayburg. (beeps) (slow dramatic music) There's no use struggling, Miss. Clayburg. Just accept what is about to happen to you. What are you talking about? [Master Control] We've had our eye on you since you arrived. And I must admit, you're an excellent candidate. Candidate, for what? [Master Control] Really Miss. Clayburg, I'm a little disappointed. I would have though you'd have figured that out after you saw the RK1600 computer. There is no computer. [Master Control] Exactly my point. So if there is no computer then there? There can't be hundreds of androids controlled by it. [Master Control] You are intelligent. Indeed, the only androids we have are the few monitors you've seen. Each of them is frightfully expensive. My goodness we could never afford to construct hundreds of androids, at least not with our present technology. Then what are all those pleasure units of yours? [Master Control] It's a sad but true fact of life Miss. Clayburg that human beings are a much more plentiful than machines and far less expensive. Oh no! How could you? [Master Control] Very simply. Actually we've been able to condition brainwaves for some time now. It simply took the invention of a semi-permanent thermal that could be implanted in the brain to make it practical. Once in place, we have complete control. Even our pleasure units think of themselves as machines. Why did you lie to the world? [Master Control] The truth would result in a great deal of self-righteous indignation and it would defeat one of our main goals. You see our guests would feel guilty about taking out their fantasies on other humans. But androids can be abused with no guilt after effects. After all, they're only machines. Oh why, why, why? [Master Control] I'd love to stay and talk, but keeping things running smoothly is a very demanding job. It's going to be really nice working with you, Miss. Clayburg. Wait, what are you going to do with me? Wait, wait! No, please, no! No! (lively music) (alarm beeps) Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is the Pleasure Dome. Please come up to the reception desk so that you may begin the most fantastic week you'll ever live. (alarm beeps) Welcome, I'm Julie 14. I'm your personal pleasure unit. (computer whooshes)
