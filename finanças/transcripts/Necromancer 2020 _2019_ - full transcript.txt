[dramatic music playing] [army marching] [thunder rumbling] How could a soldier steal royal treasures just because the country is ruined? [man] Goryeo will not fall. If you are truly a loyal man, do not stand in my way. General. [man 2 grunts] IN 1388, YI SEONG-GYE TURNED HIS ARMY AROUND IN WIHWADO GENERAL CHOE YEONG SENT HIS MEN BUT WERE DEFEATED THUS THE LAST PILLAR OF GORYEO FELL GORYEO GENERALS WHO FELT THE THREAT STOLE THE KINGDOM TREASURES AND FLED FAR OUT TO SEA [thunder crashing] [epic music swelling] [metallic clanking] [seagulls warbling] [man] I mean, I know that we're thieves… [panting] …but why are we being pursued as traitors? [man 2] Well… [moaning] …we did commit treason. What are you talking about? We'll be in the afterlife soon, so I'll be truthful. [men groaning] Do you remember the Samcheok tree? Of course. I made this spoon out of it. -This one? -I've never seen a tree like that. That was for the pillars of the new palace. The pillars? [sighing] The new palace in Gyeongbokgung. The one Yi Seong-gye's building in Hanyang to make it to the capital? Yi Seong-gye searched all over the country to find wood for the pillars to support Gyeongbokgung and found that tree at the top of Taebaeksan. The one we stole in Gwangnaru? How'd it taste? Eating with the pillars of Gyeongbokgung? -[man 3 grunts] -Good? [chuckles] The reason they stopped building Gyeongbokgung… It's all… because of this spoon. Why? Why did you do it? Probably not just to eat with it? Are the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty supposed to be a tree or the people? His vision never included what was right in front of his eyes. Really got on my nerves. So because it got on your nerves-- You made thousands of soldiers chase after us. [chuckling] They're probably still after us. -You're laughing? -[man coughing] -Dammit! Let me go! -[men clamoring] If I die, will my thirst die as well? I'll go a day early to save you all seats when I get there. -I'll cut off your head! -[sword swishing] [men arguing] -[man 3] Oh get off! -[man 4] Let me go. [man 5] Let me go! Let me go! [heavenly music playing] [clamoring ceases] So they've come, at last. They've come to take me. Are you a woman who lives in the land of the gods? -[man chuckling] -[twinkling] [man] How can someone be so beautiful? That I should have to die to meet my destiny. Here. Take me with you. [wind blowing gently] [giggling] [muffled gasping] [woman] Get up. [groans angrily] [sighs] Leave me alone. -[indistinct chatter] -You're not getting up? THREE MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE One. -Two. -[groaning loudly] Let me put on some clothes first. Captain, how long are we keeping these bandits on our ship? They're extremely lazy. They poop anywhere they like, the disgusting, dirty bastards. I have no idea what kind of ship this is. Is it a pirate ship? Are you pirates or fishermen? And if they're pirates, why only attack Japanese pirates? You must attack merchant ships for the money to feast on meat. We're like the Joseon navy, only attacking the Japanese. -[man] Exactly! -Ugh. [woman gasping] Getting sick just from looking at seafood. -[grunting in disgust] -[man] Ugh. Filthy. [woman] Who did that? Who threw precious food on the deck? [man 2] She asked who threw food on the deck. [man 3] Who? It was you. I've had it with these ungrateful bastards! -Get over here, you thieving scums! -Go on! -Thieving scum. -You did it. It was you. Go on. Hurry up. Come here. Now! [sighs] Uh, I'm a pirate. -Never see you before. -This is my fifth day. -Dismissed! -Yes, sir. [man 4 laughing] Something funny? Bandits, come here. [men chuckling] Come here! -Come here! -[man 2] Yeah. I didn't think so. Come here! [man 4] Come here! Come here! -Come here! -Come here! [man 5] Japanese pirates! Japanese pirates on the horizon! [man 6] Japanese pirates on the horizon! -Japanese pirate ship? -[men clamoring] Woohoo! Yeah! Hey! They look pretty rich for a Japanese pirate ship! Huh? We'll be eating meat soon enough. Captain, I'll cook you the world's most delicious steak. Let's slowly grill the beef over the fire. And we'll feast on boiled pork! [men cheering] Black clouds. Strong winds. It's perfect weather for sword-fighting. Black clouds and strong winds? Hey. Do you even know how to use a sword? Huh? Ah, you've heard of me. Up until now, I've only dried squid, but trust me, on the mainland, they call me Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman! [all laughing] I guess we'll see about that. [laughing] Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman? [all laughing] Out of my way! [dramatic music playing] All right! The time has finally come! Today, we bandits will stand on the frontline! [men cheering] You pirates stay here and prepare to feast on the meat! -[laughing] -[ship creaks] [all gasping] -[grunting, groaning] -[laughing] Mu-chi! Stop all your bragging and come down! Don't worry about me. And build the fire, my lady. I mean, Captain. [Mu-chi straining] Come on! Let's go! Full speed ahead! Come on! Come on! [laughing] [men clamoring indistinctly] [man screams] [in Japanese] Perhaps it isn't a fishing boat? [in Japanese] I'm sure it is a fishing boat. The best swordsman in Goryeo is coming! [men shouting] [man] Hey, you bastards! [in Japanese] And I suppose these are fishing rods? Pull! More! A bit more! Yes! Follow my lead! Go! [men yelling] [water splashing] [grunting] -[laughing] -Idiot. -Let's go! -Hold on! We don't need help from pirates! We do need help, Captain! Please, help us! [men laughing obnoxiously] [Mu-chi laughing] [grunts] -[Mu-chi] Lend me your sword. -Damn it. -[water splashing] -[man] Help! [scoffing] Whoo. I'll have an easier time fighting without those guys getting in the way. [in Japanese] Kill him! [men shouting] [intense music playing] [Mu-chi grunting] [men fighting loudy] -[grunting] -[yelling] Amazing. [grunts] [Mu-chi moaning] -Mu-chi! -[sword whooshing] [groaning] [men laughing] Let's see what you can do, Mu-chi. [laughs mockingly] You're laughing? I'm holding a sword. Oh. [funky music playing] [men grunting, groaning] [Mu-chi yelling] [man grunts, groans] [yelling] [man screaming] [panting] [music fades] [whispering] Goryeo's Greatest Swordman. [scoffing] -Amazing! -[sighing] Amazing! Truly amazing! Shut up! [sail flapping] These waters belong to Joseon. Because you have plundered in our waters, I will be taking that plunder back. [in Japanese] This is ours… Yours… Ours… [in Japanese] We are sea-faring folk who follow the current. We make no distinction between our waters and your waters. [in English] Done? They say these are their waters too. What? That's a bit short. That's all, Captain. I lived on a Japanese pirate ship until I was ten. [water sloshing] -[thudding] -[murmuring] These are all your waters? [in Japanese] All yours? [in Japanese] You idiot. That's not what I said-- [in English] Shut up! -[man whimpering] -[men murmuring] He's saying the entire sea is theirs! [man 2] Captain. I looked everywhere, but there isn't any meat. -[crew gasping] -There isn't even anything like chicken? Hey. I have no idea. All this crew eats is pickled fish. [crew clamoring] [in Japanese] Please spare us! [clamoring ceases] [in Japanese] We're just… [in Japanese] Shut up! [in Japanese] We just came here in search of treasure. A huge stash of gold and silver… [in Japanese] I'll kill you! [grunting, screaming] What did he say? Oh. He… he says they're on a search for an enormous stash of treasure. [man 3] Treasure? [crew murmuring] Boy, tell me. Where's this treasure? [in Japanese] Where's the treasure? Me? [gasping] This looks like the maps they use in Goryeo military camps. [Mu-chi chuckles] Yeah. It is. I used ones just like this. "Joo Bang." General Joo Bang, who led the Goryeo Imperial Guard? That Joo Bang? The one who swept up the treasure of the imperial family and disappeared? [crew murmuring, gasping] You mean this is General Joo Bang's treasure map? They said it's Joo Bang's treasure. We could eat meat! [crew cheering] Quiet! Quiet. Why you little… How dare you tell us to be quiet! [man grunting, yelling] [laughing] Captain, let's do it. If we get this treasure, we'll never have to look at another damn squid ever again. [crew murmuring] [inhales deeply] [man] Oh, please, please. -Huh? -[sighs heavily] [crew moaning] It's treasure. Treasure! [dramatic music playing] -[Mu-chi] Please? -Huh? [woman] Okay! Let's raise our sails. [all cheering] [epic music playing] [sails flapping] [crew clamoring] Let's go! [seagulls warbling] So I see the dragon's daughter is at a loss when it comes to being on land. [man retching] Oh, here. Look, it's right here. Don't tell me you can't see it. -Seriously… -[woman exhales sharply] Come on! The dragon is master of the sea, but the tiger wins on land. Uh… [scattered giggling] [Mu-chi sighs] Right! You'll follow me from now on! Let's go! Greet your guests! Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman, Wu Mu-chi, and his men have arrived! [creature lowing] [crew] What was that? [crew] What was that? [man] What? [ominous music playing] [crew murmuring] What the hell did he yell at? Over there! Over there! -[Mu-chi yells] -[crew gasping] [man 2] You saw it! -[cow mooing] -[man 3] A cow! Do you see it? [crew] A cow! Looks like the meat is coming to greet us first! [crew cheering] Before finding the treasure, let's fill our bellies! -Stop! Do not act out of line. -[crew cheering] Head to the tunnel! [sighs impatiently] [Mu-chi yelling] Come on! [adventurous music playing] -[crew gasping] -[cows mooing] [all] Cows! Cows! Cows! -[crew] No! Come back! -Turn around! No! Come back! Why? [crew cackling] Get out of the way! [mooing] [cows mooing] Turn around! [screaming] [man 3] What's happening? [crew yelling] [cow mooing] [whimsical music playing] [inaudible] [cow mooing] [groaning] Boss! [Mu-chi grunting, screaming] [man 4] Why? [man 5 sighs] He was too full of himself… [sighs] He died such a sudden death after living such a lowly life. Leaving behind only his spoon. [crying] Captain. We should go. [seagulls warbling] [Mu-chi screaming] [grunting, yelping] [straining] [screaming] [gong reverberating] [Mu-chi grunting] [laughing obnoxiously] [man 5] Captain, look! Look! Look over there! -[man 6] How did he survive? [grunting] Look who's back, huh? -Here. Your hand. [grunting] -[woman grunts] [dramatic music playing] [Mu-chi] Kang-seop. [grunts] Kang-seop. -[grunting] -[shushing] Now I understand why there's a tusk drawn on the map. This is the real treasure map. Let us return to the ship and feast. -Yes, Captain. -[crew marveling] [man] A treasure map. A treasure map. [crew clamoring] [man wincing, groaning] Why would you enter the cave when there's a herd of cows coming? [moaning] I'm injured too. Honestly, unbelievable. I had a bad feeling about that cave. [man 2] Who's making that damn whiny noise? You thieves, listen here! I said we're honest bandits. [moaning] I took you in because I pitied how you all fled to sea after being branded as traitors to Goryeo. But I didn't think you'd stick around with us. Seeing how fat you've grown since then, I think the time has come to tell you. Are you telling us to leave? Listen! From this moment on, on my ship, only pirates can sail with us. -[crew cheering] -[man] Pirate! And if a bandit becomes a pirate? [woman] Then I'll accept him. Kang-seop, as you're second-in-command, I'll name you as first mate with A-gwi. Captain! [sighs] [man] Are we pirates now too? This will be good. [adventurous music playing] [A-gwi sighs] [Mu-chi] Hey! [grunting] Hey. Who said you could name him as your first mate, huh? Wu Mu-chi, I will… make you my quartermaster. [Mu-chi scoffs] You'll make me your underling? Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman? Just as the sea has only one Dragon King, a pirate crew can have only one captain. You're not just trying to play queen bee? Watch what you say, Quartermaster. Be careful. Don't call me quartermaster! Take a second to look at your bandits, Mu-chi! Every day is like a war, balanced on the line between life and death. You cannot lead a group if you confuse them with two different orders. You telling me to go? If that's what you want. [whimsical music playing] Listen to me! I'm abandoning the ship and staying here. Look there! The path by sea is unclear. [A-gwi scoffing] Who will walk the righteous path with me? It's fine. Stay seated. You're staying here with me anyway. Don't get sick. [crew groaning] -I'm coming too. -Beats being a bandit. [woman] Let's go! Those who follow me are known as pirates from here on out. [A-gwi] Take care. Is there really no one who will follow me? One, two. One, two. [dramatic music playing] [Mu-chi sighs] Those… Look at those disloyal morons, huh? Kang-seop, you stand for what a bandit should stand for. -For what is a bandit? Those united by-- -Thank you for everything, boss. Take care of yourself and watch out for soldiers. You'd… Hang on, Kang-seop! [grunts] -Come on, man. -[crew] Hurry up! -Wait for me! -Come on. It's you and me! Now, Wu Mu-chi-- [giggles] [Kang-Seop] I said wait for me! Kang-seop. Stay here! Come back here! -Come back here! -[Kang-Seop] Wait! [A-gwi] One, two! Go on, then! Go! Good riddance! Good riddance! [grunts] -[man yells] -[sword swishing] [man yelling] [swords clanging] [man 2 laughing] I'd heard that you killed the leader of Jurchen in Kuju. YI BANG-WON -It appears that was true. -[horse snorts] [ominous music playing] [Bang-won] The throne, you say? So you think I took command of a few hundred soldiers just to take the throne? You don't have enough men for that and, also, they seem unprepared. [chuckling] You are the real traitor. I appreciate it, you remembering that. Just come out with it. Prosperity. One does not claim the throne through rank but rather with power. You can have an army with wealth, and with an army comes power. I don't have wealth, I must admit. If I told you there was a hidden treasure, will you take it? [indistinct chatter] [man] Now this is a pirate ale! [crew laughing raucously] Hey. Give it here. [man 2] The treasure is now within our hands! Well, I wonder if he ate anything. Shall I go and quietly bring him back here? [upbeat music playing] If he wanted to come, he would have swum here already. [groans loudly] I'm so full. [crew partying raucously] [scoffing] Man… [man] Captain! The elephant tusk is gone! [man 2] What? What is gone? -The elephant tusk is gone! -Who did this? Who do you think did it? Ugh. That dirty, thieving bastard! I can't believe I ever called him boss. Dammit! [crew lamenting] -[man 3 grunts] -Wu Mu-chi! -[woman grunting] -[sword swishing] [woman] Wu Mu-chi, I'm going to kill you if I ever catch you! [man] Why do you think he left us his location? That idiot. Hold on. Is this a trap? A trap? I've known him a long time. [panting] He's not that cunning. Trust me. [tiger growling] What is this growling? [Kang-Seop] What else will growl like that? It has to be a tiger. [woman] A tiger? [tiger growling] [tiger roaring] [woman screaming] -[Kang-Seop] Run away! -[birds screeching] [Mu-chi moaning] [banging] [woman breathing heavily] [clattering] Rang? [chuckles] -Is this real, or a dream? -I'm going to kill you, you damn thief! -It would be nice if it weren't a dream. -[Hae-Rang] I'm going to kill you! [Hae-rang yelling, grunting] That hurt! [grunting] -[thudding] -Ow! [groaning] -[Hae-rang] Get up! -Wait! Wait a moment! [sizzling] Why did you return? Did you miss me already? [soft music playing] Are you proud of your thievery because you're originally a thief? [inhales deeply] Hey, Hae-rang. I told you I'm honest. All right, wait. Just wait. Listen to me. Who discovered the tusk? I discovered it, but you-- You call it thievery. Yeah. I only have a couple things to say to you. Hmm. One, you should die for the crime of stealing from your brothers. I'm the one that found it. Two, simply return the tusk to me and I won't kill you. [laughing] What an impressive threat. Did you forget? Greatest swordsman. -Even a crying tiger-- -Please stop! [exhales annoyedly] Never say the "ger" in tiger in front of me again. [exhales sharply] [growling] [growling] [Hae-rang grunting] Hey! Hey! Wait! [Mu-chi] Stop! [grunting] [intense music playing] [groaning loudly] [breathing heavily] You're really trying to kill me! Dammit! -[sword slicing] -[Mu-chi yelling] -[Hae-rang grunts] -[Mu-chi groaning] [both grunting] [sword ringing] [Mu-chi moaning loudly] Give me the tusk. [laughing] -I don't have it. -Really? -[Mu-chi gasping] -[music intensifies] [Hae-rang screaming] [Mu-chi breathing heavily] Answer honestly and I'll tell you. Did you find me because of the tusk, or because you missed me? [both chuckling] -[thudding] -[Mu-chi groaning] Mak-yi took it. [Mu-chi yelling] -[urine splashing] -Boss. The tusk? Thief! -[screaming] -[water splashing] What, were you planning to find the treasure and keep it all to yourself? [laughing] -Do I look that dishonorable? -Then what? [grunting] Soon she'll come to find me and beg me on her knees. Who? Captain Hae-rang? [laughing] [Mak-yi chuckles] So your plan is to use the tusk as leverage to get your position back as boss? [grunting] Tell me, why bring a blanket if you're planning on going back anyway? I wasn't thinking straight. [both breathing heavily] Now that we've sailed here together, our fates are linked, huh? [Mak-yi panting] There are soldiers in every direction here. -Soldiers? -Yeah. Since you know the mountains now, you climb to the peak first. To the peak? And if the coast is clear, strike your flint. Clack, clack twice. -Twice. -And I'll follow with the baggage. -[gasps in excitement] -[Mak-yi] Mm-hmm. Right. -Right. -Right. -You're right. -Okay. Uh-uh. Leave this to your subordinate. Boss, you need to focus on the bigger stuff, not chores. [whimsical music playing] [whispering] You… Mak-yi, a subordinate? Upon my return, you're my quartermaster. -Yes, boss. -Yeah. How many strikes? -Twice. -[Mak-yi] Twice. Right. Go on, quickly. -[Mu-chi muttering] -You got this. Go on, quickly! [Mak-yi grunting] -Go. Go on. -[Mu-chi] Right. [Mu-chi panting] [Mak-yi] To the left. [Mu-chi huffing] Chump. So naive. [Mu-chi] That night, I kept striking the flint all night long. [groaning] [Hae-rang] Idiot. Starting to feel like all you pirates are like that. No more self-pity. The rumor is spreading that Wu Mu-chi is selling the tusk. It has already spread even across the sea. Mak-yi, son of a-- BYEOKRANDO -[woman] You can't go in there! -[Mak-yi] Out of my way! I'm so sorry, sir. He just burst his way in. I've come because I have a rare item. I am Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman. The one with Hae-rang? That Wu Mu-chi? [chuckling] I'm embarrassed that you know my humble history. After conquering the vast ocean, I cared for Hae-rang just like a sworn sister. [man laughing] Let me introduce. Who? Hae-rang. Who is? I am? [whimsical music playing] [woman] Only 10,000 nyang. [man scoffs] Only 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth? It's what that legend is about. What legend? [Mak-yi] It was a day when lightning struck the Kingdom of Goryeo. Yi Seong-gye turned back his army from Wihwado. General Choe was defeated. There was no other choice. However, they say, even as the country was in ruin, there was a great general who made plans for the future. He took the gold from the Royal Treasury and Office of Internal Affairs. He wouldn't cede the kingdom to Yi Seong-gye. And using the treasure his military would rebuild Goryeo. W-what? I'm hearing this for the first time. Of course, you are. Everybody who knows the secret has died. [scoffing] You have before you the treasure map that leads to that royal treasure. The one that disappeared. [inhales deeply] Now you must show us your boldness that makes a mockery of 10,000 nyang. [breathing deeply] [scoffing] 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth. You should take it. You will not regret it. [Mu-chi] Out of the way! -[grunting] -[man groans] [gasping] You son of a-- [grunting, groaning] [Mu-chi] Kang-seop, damn you! What are you doing? What's going on? Oh, Captain. Damn it. What do I do? [A-gwi] This bastard. [clattering] [Mak-yi] How… How did you… [whimpers] You look so extravagant. Yes, yes. I was just about to take that… Yes? So this is, uh… Wait. So this must be the girl you said was your sworn sister. You said you couldn't stand her because she was too stubborn and hot-tempered. [muttering] [whimsical music playing] Captain, please… Please just kill me! That I will. And you are? Well, I'm the last princess of the Kingdom of Goryeo-- Tie them up together! A princess? How dare you! Hey! Okay. You saw that? Untie me! -You're tying me up too? How dare you! -[Mak-yi] Wait. -[Mu-chi] Aren't you gonna untie me? -[A-gwi] Pipe down! Everything we have, we earned with the blood of our brothers. But Wu Mu-chi broke and discarded that loyalty, and colluded with Mak-yi, who recently joined us. It wasn't c-collusion, I was kidnapped! Don't interrupt the captain while she's delivering her judgment! Say your last words! [seagulls warbling] -My lady, as the last princess of Goryeo-- -[Hae-rang] I'll judge you separately. -Such impudence. -[man] Who is she anyway? Gom-chi. [crew cheering] Gom-chi! Captain, don't! Please! [whimpering] Not only have I not married yet, I haven't even held a woman's hand! -[whimpering] -[sighing] So-- [screaming] [crew laughing] -Gom-chi, Gom-chi, Gom-chi! -[sword swishing] I… I was born on a Japanese pirate ship and was abused for ten years just because I wasfrom Joseon. My mother and I fled together. Too bad you were captured by a slave-trader ship. [yelling] I spent another ten years being abused there! [breath shuddering] And even lost my mother. [sobbing] Gom-chi… [hyperventilating] [growls] I'll go first! A true boss does not let the subordinate go first. [crew] Ooh. That's the first time you've said anything like a boss! [crew laughing] [A-gwi] I'll send you first. [yelling] [crew quieting down] [A-gwi yelling] -[Mu-chi grunting] -[crew marveling] [funky music playing] [crew shouting] [Mu-chi grunting] [groaning] [A-gwi] Come on! [crew clamoring] [Mu-chi] Whoo! [laughing] [grunting, groaning] [crew clamoring] [Mu-chi] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [Mu-chi] Come on. Everyone, stop! Especially you! Archer, don't you move! Lower your bow! I said lower your bow, dammit! [seagulls warbling] [Mu-chi] Your captain promised me! She said she would spare me if I gave her the tusk! Didn't you? I did, but that tusk already belongs to us. Oh yeah? You sure? It's in my hands now. On the other hand, you want it in the Dragon King's hands. [crew clamoring] No! [Kang-seop chuckles] [laughing] [Mu-chi grunts] [Mu-chi] Stop! I'll let it go! I'll really drop it! [dramatic music playing] [Hae-rang] Hmm. Give it. Hae-rang, Were you really gonna kill me? Hmm. [chuckling] Well, I knew you weren't going to die because you were hiding a knife. [chuckling] You saw that? [laughing] I see a man who cries then laughs. Just as I thought, you're prettiest when you're being mean. [grunting, screaming] [crew laughing] [Mu-chi] Save me! Save me! [whimpers] [Mak-yi straining] Let's run away, boss. I can't live as a slave any longer. [both straining] You'd be a quartermaster now if you hadn't betrayed me. -You should've struck the flint properly. -You! I struck the flint until I got blisters on my hands. You should've struck it until until the blisters burst! You… you shut your mouth! -[woman] Mister, they're messing around. -[Mak-yi] Get off me! [both grunting, straining] Quartermaster, how do you know the Goryeo military way of cracking the code? I told you. I was the last warrior of the Kindgom of Goryeo. [scoffing] Dogs and cows claim to be the last warrior as well. If you gather all of them, you'd have a million soldiers. [groans] Dogs and cows? [sucks teeth] Get on with it! [Kang-seop] That's it. Let me see what's written. Dammit. It's a code. It's an old military cipher only used by Goryeo officers. Were you a private? Private Last Warrior? [all laughing] [Gom-chi] Private The Very Bottom. -[thunder rumbling] -[Bang-won] What have you found out? [man] I searched for General Joo Bang, starting with those who died in battle from the Office of Internal Affairs. Three things disappeared that day. -First was General Joo Bang. -[man grunting] Second was the treasure of the imperial family of Goryeo -And the last… -[man cackling] … was Joo Bang's wife. [Bang-won] Of course, Joo Bang must have had someone backing him. Did you find his wife? She shaved her head… -[breathing raggedly] -…and became a Buddhist nun. Goodness. You must have searched every temple and hermitage in the country. What happened? Did she tell you where the treasure is? [ominous music playing] So, where… is it? "Haegildo"? "A sea cave beneath a rock with no shadow." "Haegildo"? Isn't that the p-perilous sea route? The sea is the sea, however perilous it is. -You don't know anything about it. -There's treasure? The… the water goes-- Hey! Since you've lived trapped on that cramped land, you don't know anything. The whirlpools there, they keep swirling, and… [whooshing] A river flows under the ocean! [laughing] Poop is poop and farts are farts. How can a river flow under the sea? I'm telling you it flows! Why you little-- It flows! [Gom-chi's breath shuddering] -[Gom-chi] It flows, it flows. -Forgive me. There's diarrhea too. The problem is that we don't know how long the river is. In other words, no one's gone under and come out the other end. [Mu-chi] Well, then I'm not going. I give up. I give up. Captain, let's not go. -First mate! -Yes? Bring the boat to shore and catch ten pigs. -[A-gwi sighs] -Yes. -[crew clamoring] -[Kang-seop] Raise the sails! [adventurous music playing] If what you're saying is true, it surely is an amazing amount of treasure. What do you want in return? Become the king of Joseon. [laughing] Yah! And you? I want to be the king of Tamna. [dramatic music playing] Enjoy your trip, Boss! [crew] Bye! [man] Oh no. What is that whirpool, huh? Whoa! There's no way of knowing where the river under the sea ends. Do not let go of your pouch. [muttering indistinctly] [man] Yah! Yah! [horse neighing] [horse snorting] [horse neighing] You said we might die. Are you afraid? Someone so afraid shouldn't be a leader. Uh… A leader who's afraid can find a way for us all to survive together. We're risking our lives to survive together. -[men muttering] -[Mak-yi] Yeah. Sure. -[wave crashing] -[men groaning] [seagulls warbling] Captain, our boat will be swept away if we go any closer to it. We'll ride the current from here! -Let's go! -[Mak-yi] Yes, Captain! [men clamoring] -[Mak-yi] Ugh. What's this smell? -[A-gwi] Go on! [screaming] [Hae-rang] They're the pigs bladders that you washed so earnestly. They're filled with air. [retching] -[Mak-yi] I thought it smelled like piss. -I didn't wash mine thoroughly. [scoffing] I'm so scared, mister. [Mak-yi retching] [screaming] No, don't! [screaming] -You go first. -[retching] I can't make it. [retching] Hurry up and go, you bastard! Don't worry! I'll take care of the boat! Have a safe trip! [screaming] [groaning] [suspenseful music playing] [retching] [vomiting] [dramatic music playing] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting, screaming] [vomiting] [muffled speech] [wondrous music playing] [Hae-rang grunting] [Hae-rang gasping, breathing heavily] [Hae-rang grunts] [blowing, gasping] [Hae-rang panting] [Hae-rang] Get up. Clench your teeth. -[Hae-rang grunts] -[groaning, coughing] [crew gasping, yelling] Mak-yi? [Mak-yi gasping, retching] [retching] [A-gwi] That stinks! Captain, it's not here either. [groans] Really? Just where is the treasure. [scoffing] I mean, really. [Gom-chi] Captain! There isn't another path! It's completely blocked off! [A-gwi] Look harder! Captain, what's next? This is why I wanted to sell the map, in case this happened. [woman sucks teeth] I thought Hae-rang would be different, but she's just the same as those fools getting tricked by a fake map. -[Gom-chi] It's not here either? -[Mak-yi] Ugh. I'm hungry! [A-gwi] Hey. It's not there either? [A-gwi] Hey. Gather around. Get over here, quickly! He said gather around. [Mak-yi] I'm saying it because it came up. If we had sold the map, where would we be? -[A-gwi] Shut up! -[Mak-yi] I'm not wrong. [A-gwi] What should we do? Should we check again? [Mu-chi] Okay, okay, okay. What are you gonna do? They're all waiting for your next order. [sniffs] [snorting] [whimsical music playing] You risked our lives bringing us here, hmm? Whether you give them despair or hope, the leader needs to take responsibility. [Mu-chi sniffs] [sighing loudly] Hey, Hae-rang. A leader must… must use their brain. Yeah? [Gom-chi] Huh? Did he…? [crew gasping] How dare you touch the captain's head! -Watch closely. -You bastard! -[Mu-chi grunting] -[A-gwi yelling] [Mu-chi scoffing] What? [man] What the hell is that? How will he kill him? Now you're a goner. [laughing] You still think you're the boss. [laughing] Too bad you don't have your sword. Never in my life have I lost a fistfight. Neither have I. [dramatic music playing] [yelling] Gom-chi! [A-gwi yelling] [screaming] [cave rumbling] -[crew clamoring] -[woman] Such imeciles. [A-gwi groaning] [shuddering] [Mu-chi panting] I discovered this path that was blocked by a stalactite. Captain, please go ahead. [Hae-rang gulping] [exhales sharply] [chittering] Hey. You upset? You all right? [crew muttering] Whoo! [A-gwi] Captain. [Mak-yi] What? [crew clamoring, cheering] [yelling] [man] You could by 100 rolls of silk with just one of these. -It's enough to build ten palaces! -I know! Move. -[man] Hmm? -Out of the way. [Mak-yi] He's acting all haughty again. -[clattering] -I'm a bit disappointed. [man] Why? I'm happy with it. [chuckles] Why are there only silver bottles? The royal treasure should have gold pieces. Gold pieces? A box of these silver bottles would be worth… one piece of gold. [clattering] How many gold pieces should there be? About this big and this much. This much. This… It's said that it filled up the entire Royal Treasury of Goryeo's palace. We must find the gold! [crew clamoring] Find the gold pieces! [crew shouting] -[woman] Hurry! -[Gom-chi] Over there! You aren't lying, are you? I'm honorable. I'm Wu Mu-chi. What is this? This isn't a flag they use in military camps. At first glance, it looks like the face of a goblin, but when you look at it up close… When you look at it up close? [tense music playing] I have no idea. [sighs] Get out of the way. [explosion] [crew screaming] [wind whooshing] [screaming] It's an earthquake! Captain, it's an earthquake! A-gwi, Gom-chi, go back to the boat and bring more rope. Yes, captain. Gom-chi, hurry! Follow me! [coughing] [crew clamoring] [Hae-rang] Everyone, get back! [Mu-chi coughing, groaning] [ominous music playing] [coughing] Someone's here. [sword swishing] [man 2] Halt. [soldier] Yes, sir. [exhales slowly] [exhales slowly] [exhales slowly] -[Mak-yi] Huh? -[man] Help move these. Wait. Isn't this a… a sea chart? What? A map? [Mak-yi] Joseon, Japan. [clattering] [Mak-yi] And h-here is Inazuma Island. Inazu… w-what… zuma? [shushing] -[arrow whizzing] -[screams] [crew screaming] Run back to the pond! [whimpering] [man] Hurry up! Come on, quickly! [straining] -[arrow whizzing] -[screaming] [intense music playing] [both breathing heavily] [cackling] [sword clanging] [man 2 grunts] [both grunting] [soldier yelling, grunting] -[sword slicing] -[soldier groaning] [archer grunting] [Mu-chi grunting] [soldier 2 groans] [yelling] [Hae-rang grunting] -What about the captain? -[A-gwi] Still in the cave. -[Hae-rang grunting] -[Mu-chi roaring] [sword swishing] [Mu-chi] What the… [man 2 whooshing] [groaning] [Hae-rang grunting, groaning] [groaning] [both groaning, panting] -You okay? -Ah, it hurts, dammit! [rumbling] [Hae-rang grunting] [soldier breathing heavily] [yelling] Captain! Captain! [swords clanging] Get the captain out of here! [yelling] [man 2] Get them! [grunting, groaning] [both grunting, groaning] [Mu-chi straining] [Mu-chi breathing heavily] Wu Mu-chi. You bandit scum! [screaming] [dramatic music playing] [lamenting vocalizing] Officer Bu Heung-su of Tamna. Reporting the successful decapitation of the enemy general. [soldiers yelling, grunting] [intense music playing] [grunting, groaning] [sword slicing] Prepare for battle! We attack them at nightfall. [soldier] Reporting! I have a direct order! Evacuate the wounded and make camp. The enemy line is closeby. We ambush them tonight and-- It's an order! Evacuate the wounded first and make camp-- [soldiers screaming] Deliver the message that we have no wounded. There are only two kinds of men in my unit. Fighting or dead. You marched on after killing the wounded? Isn't that how war is? [Mu-chi] You killed your own men with your own hands? In exchange, I offer the general's head. His Majesty promised to make you king of Tamna if you brought him the enemy's head, correct? What of it? I won't allow a man like you to become king. You'll be punished according to military law. Arrest and bind him, now! [army] Yes, sir! [Heung-su] You dirty thief. You'll kill me and take credit for my success? -Lower your sword. -I don't intend to hand the credit to you! [both grunting, groaning] [Mu-chi screams] [groaning] [moaning, coughing] [gasping] Again a mistake. So you need treasure, do you? [Mu-chi] Watch out! [tutting] Another one goes in for each step you take. [swords clang] Will you steal what is mine, you aging thief? If you still covet what is out of your reach. [soldier hisses] If not for you and your men, I would've already been a king. [laughing] A king? How can someone who's lower than a beast be a king? You can go to hell! [Mu-chi] Whoa, whoa! [soldier] The treasure! [screaming] Whoa! Captain! [intense music playing] [water bubbling] [Heung-su grunting] [straining] [grunting] [yelling] [grunting] [Mu-chi groaning] [straining] [grunting] [Mu-chi] Sorry. [Kang-seop] Why aren't they coming up? Do you think something happened to the captain? I better go down there. [Gom-chi shouts] The rope! -Come on! -Get them up! [Kang-seop] Pull! [crew clamoring] [dramatic music playing] [gasping, groaning] [yelling] [water sloshing] [whale lowing] [crew clamoring] [suspenseful music playing] [boat creaking] [crew shouting indistinctly] [screaming] [rope straining] [crew clamoring] [Gom-chi] Captain! Boss! [crew wailing] [Kang-seop] Thank you, Captain. Farewell, Boss. She's gone to a better place. [Mak-yi] Where did the sea chart go? [crew clamoring] [screaming] [screaming] Where's the captain? [screaming] Where's the captain? -[Mu-chi] Huh? -[whale blowing] Whoa! [wind whooshing] [Mu-chi screaming] Not that way! This way, this way! [screaming] [Mu-chi moaning loudly] Wait, wait! What about the silver? -[Mu-chi moaning] The whale! The whale! -[Gom-chi] Whale? [crew clamoring] No! Not this! Give us the treasure! [whale lowing] What's that, Captain? [chuckles] [sighs] [ominous music playing] [dragon roaring] [dragon growling] [breathing heavily] [gasping] It was a sea chart. -[clattering] -[woman gasps, sighs] I thought I should sort some of your things. Seems like you're stealing as well. I'm not stealing them, I was just sorting them out. -[Hae-rang groaning] -These just got all tangled together. How are you feeling, Captain? Thanks to you my head hurts now. [chuckling] These clothes are really quite pretty, but strange. There are a lot of unusual things in western seas. I'm the only woman on board, so everything I've gathered is piled up in the storage. You can wear whatever you want. Then please get some rest. The things hanging from my belt, they were inherited from brothers who've already died. They are my prized possessions. [woman sighs heavily] [woman gasps] Oh dear. Oh crap. They're yours. [gasping] I pledge my loyalty-- [scoffing] What loyalty? We find ourselves in the same situation. That's why we should be honest with each other. I hope you realize that you can depend on us. Don't struggle on your own. [clattering] [chuckling] What does it matter between two thieving women? [laughs] [clattering] [woman] These just keep falling out of nowhere. [Hae-rang clears throat] What are you doing? The sun's up. Do-mi, you better stop drinking so much. [Mu-chi sighs] [clears throat] [emotional music playing] You okay? What? [music stops] Do you love treasure that much? You could've died out there. We all wanted it, Mu-chi. It's worth it, even if getting it means risking my life. What will you do with it once you have it? Stop it! You wouldn't understand. [footsteps receding] [Mu-chi] What would I not understand? We're a big family out here on the ocean. But the ship isn't the only place where family is. We have family elsewhere. The family of those who've died before us, and more family to come in the future. Right now… there's nothing I can do for those people. [Mu-chi sighs] Is that your responsibility as captain? [crew talking indistinctly] That's some… pain in the neck. I want to know! Why did you think the treasure would be gold pieces? If the tusk is right and it's supposed to be enough to rebuild Goryeo, it would be all the gold pieces in the Royal Treasury. -Gold pieces? -And what about that goblin flag? It's back in the cave. Turn around. We're going back to the cave to get the flag. -What? -Huh? That flag is an inverted sea chart. [man] A sea chart? It might be a map to the treasure, to the Royal Treasury's gold. [crew clamoring] Turn the ship around! Turn the ship around! No. No! No, no, no, no, no, no. -[man 2] No? -[Mak-yi] No? There's no need to go back. -What are you doing? -Just hand it over. -Hand what over? -You have it, the goblin flag. What was that? [crew murmuring] [chuckles nervously] I don't. -What? Hey! -You… Where did you hide it? -Wait a minute! -[woman] Where did you hide it? Fine! The treasure… [laughing] Search him! -[Kang-seop] Come here, you! -[crew clamoring] -[Kang-seop] Strip off all his clothes. -[Mak-yi] I lost it! [whimpering] Just kill me instead! You must be having a rough time, huh? -Captain, please. -[Hae-rang tutting] -[Hae-rang] You poor thing. -It's been so hard. -[Hae-rang] Blow. -[snorts] Have some heart. How could you be so cruel to Mak-yi? [crying] Make it stop. End this cruelty. So cruel. [sobbing] [woman grunts] The goblin map. You saw it, right? Did you happen to see any of the markings? Yes. The location? The island of Inazuma. What "ma"? In our language, it's, um, "Beongaesum." -Beongaesum? -Beongaes--. -[A-gwi] Hey. -[sighs heavily] Wait. The Beongaesum from the stories? [Gom-chi groans] Are you joking? Storm clouds rain down lightning there 1,000 times a day. Every time it comes down, it's ten years' worth of lightning in one go, like pop, pop, pop! Ten years worth? Bullshit! Hey. It's true, okay? Where is it, then? [whimsical music playing] I've only heard of it. I've never been there. -[Mu-chi groans] -Never been there? -You little-- -He's not lying. Oh. So you've been there, Captain? [sighs] Sometimes, the whole sky fills up with lightning as far as the eye can see. It sounds like quite the spectacle. I've never actually seen it either. [sighs] It had to be Beongaesum. -[Kang-seop grunting] -[A-gwi whimpering] Swirling winds rip the sails, the lightning snaps the mast. It's a living hell among hells. [screaming] [man screaming] And who told you that? Despite how I look, I'm a man of the oceans. I was born on a pirate ship, traveling the oceans since suckling my mother's breast. Hang on. That means you know the way? [adventurous music playing] [scoffing] Jeez… This is ridiculous. Woohoo! What is that big, bad boy? That's the Fire Dragon Cannon that the Emperor Hongwu bestowed upon King Gongmin to suppress the Japanese pirates. Weren't we after treasure? There's more than just Japanese pirates. Yeah. Those other pirate bastards. Captain, if I may, I'm gonna give this bad boy a try. -[man laughing] -[man 2] Me too! Do you like killing that much? Isn't that the joy of life? [cackling] [man 3] Out of the way. Out of the way! Get out! [tense music playing] [Mak-yi] With a blanket of dark clouds, the entire sky is filled with lightning, like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap. So where is this exactly, huh? Will you quit interrupting? We'll be up all night at this rate. -This bastard! -Whoa! Captain! Stop cutting him off! [crew muttering] [Mak-yi] Okay. Where was I? [crew clamoring] Anyway, we can't go there. We'll definitely die if we do. Okay, I understand. So why don't you just tell us just the location. All right? -Hmm? -I told you we'll all die. You're a good boy. Right, Mak-yi? We won't go. So tell me, where is it? If you're not going, why do you need the location? -[man] This bastard! -[crew muttering] -Give me a sword. I'll just kill him now. -[Gom-chi] Here, Captain. [crew clamoring] [Mu-chi sighs] Let's not go there, Captain. Those waters sound too dangerous to cross with mere courage. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. To be afraid of the sea, of all places, you can't call yourself a pirate. Can you? He's a fisherman. We are pirates, and the open sea is our domain! [man 2] The gold is waiting for us! [man 3] No one can stop us, not even ourselves! -[man 4] To find the treasure! -[crew cheering] [man 4] Let's go! If you guide us to Bongaesum, you can keep a tenth of the treasure there. [crew murmuring] [man 5] Why would we give it to him? Give it to me now, while I'm still alive. If I'm dead, what good is gold? Is there something else? [scoffs] There's nothing here worth exchanging your life for? Well, it's not that there isn't anything I want. It's not like you're going to give it to me, so… What is it, then? [whimsical music playing] It's… I can't bring myself to say it. [laughing] [man 6] What is it? Say it! -Only I know how to get there. -[man 7] Yes, indeed. -Only I have been there. -We know, we know. With that in mind… See… [Mu-chi] I got it! You want to become the captain. -[scoffing] -[crew] What? [crew clamoring] It's unfair for me to die after being treated like this. So just at least until we find the treasure, Pirate King. Are you mad? Do you want a swift death? [Mu-chi grunts] Put it down. Shouldn't the captain decide? Well? Ah. As a captain you can risk your life, but you can't give up your authority, huh? [scoffs] I'll ask everyone! You can choose one or the other. Shall we go find the treasure after fulfilling Mak-yi's request? Or shall we kill him right now to maintain order? [Gom-chi groans] Those of you who want the treasure raise your hand. [crew muttering] [Mu-chi] Come on, Captain. You need to close your eyes. [inhales deeply] [exhales slowly] [whimsical music playing] [Mak-yi crying] Mother, I am the Pirate King. [crying] [laughing] Let me greet the Dragon King! [chuckling] I am the new… Pirate King, Mak-yi! [retching] [Hae-rang grunts] Captain, uh, leave this kind of chore to your subordinates. All right? Think of it as a vacation for a few days, and take a break. [Mu-chi] Dammit! The captain is the one manning the helm, of course. So just call me Rang, the quartermaster. Come on, Captain! It's almost dinnertime. Off you go! I mean, how could we possibly do anything when you're down here working, Captain? Get out, dammit! Please. Okay, okay, Rang. -Rang? Did you say Rang? -Come on. She seems upset. Big time. [Kang-seop] She's sensitive about the situation even though it's only for a few days. Even if it's only for a few days, they're all blinded by the gold. Dammit! I'll kill the ones who raised their hands! -[A-gwi groans] Why are you hitting me? -[Kang-seop] You kept your eyes open. Chin up, yeah? Rang. As far as I'm concerned, I really felt relieved. How about you? Hey. Money is the real boss these days, you know? You just lost against gold. How do you win against gold, hmm? -Don't mind it too much. -[Hae-rang grunts] Tread carefully. It's not about the position. I was willing to give it up if there was anyone worthy. Worthy how? [woman] Captain Mak-yi, time to eat! [Mak-yi chuckling] -[Mak-yi grunting] -[woman gasps] -Who am I? -[woman] The new captain. [hissing] New captain, sir. From now on, no fishy food on my plate. -Bring me a cooked chicken and rice wine. -[blows raspberry] Hey, captain? Halfmoon Island is on the right. Didn't you say to make a left here? You're a moron. Why didn't you tell me when you saw it? But I just got up here. Why couldn't you get up there sooner? Because someone was standing up here until now, acting all cool and showing off. Don't give him any food. Even old squid is wasted on that fool. No food for you. Eat that! [laughing] -[Gom-chi] Jerk. -Hey. Wipe here. That's enough. Get lost. -Hey, Witless. -Yeah? Go up there too. Isn't one person enough? You can't really see once the sun sets anyway. -We need to have dinner, Captain. -I'm hungry. You'll eat your dinner up there with that other moron! How could he change that much? It's pissing me off. -[Mak-yi] What are you muttering about? -I didn't say anything. [moans happily] [Mu-chi] Yeah! You are incredible! Hey. How did you… did you make sardines taste like this? Not all sardines are the same. Ocean flavors, if you know them, you can draw the real flavor like this. Wow! I knew you had good cooking skills. But I never expected it to be this good. Seriously! Mmm! [spitting] Hey. The Captain should not be cooking! [crew retching] She's better as a captain than a chef! [retching quietly] [breath shuddering] [groans happily] [muffled] I finished it! All of it! [Hae-rang grunts] Take your time eating. I'll make it often from now on. Huh? Mmm! [crew cheering loudly] [woman] I'm telling you it's very serious I can't sleep. [man sighs] [woman gasps] Come over here. Take a look at this. The legs of the bed are all bro… ken. [sighs] All fixed now. Good. Excuse me. [footsteps receding] -Why would you fix the bed, Rang? -Why not me? [woman sighs heavily] Do you have any idea how hard it was to break all of those? [Hae-rang] Huh? [woman] Seriously… I mean, why did you… [sighs] I'm sorry. It's okay. Could you help me out and let me borrow that red stuff? The thing you put on your lips. I have no such thing. You know. Come on. When you're around Mu-chi in the kitchen, and you put it on to-- -[shushing] -[Mu-chi whistling] [Mu-chi groaning] Rang, are you there? [Mu-chi clears throat] [soft music playing] [Mu-chi sighs] Did you ask me here to see this? You like it? [Hae-rang] I forgot the night sky was always so beautiful. [Mu-chi chuckles lightly] [Hae-rang sighs contentedly] What did you put in your hair? My hair? Uh, it's oily from not washing it. [A-gwi] Who the hell was it? Who touched my sesame oil? [sniffing] They're looking for you. [Mu-chi sighs] Rang, what do you know of love? That's personal. Huh? [scoffing] What are you talking about, personal? [inhales deeply] Love means something different for everyone. Just like waves of different sizes. [scoffing] Then is love you give to courtesans a big wave or a small wave? [chuckles] -I only drank there. -Yeah. Sure. [laughs] I only drank. I swear. Your quartermaster, Kang-seop… I don't recall asking about that. [chuckles] Really, I only drank. -Kang-seop-- -I'm going back down. Rang. Rang, wait. Take a look at this. Rang. [Heung-su] "Meaning is as deep as the sea, but courage is hidden in the dark. Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth." [wind blowing gently] What does it mean, captain? We have to solve this riddle in order to find the treasure. Impaling the head on a spike is a punishment usually reserved for traitors. Do you know who these 12 men are, captain? [suspenseful music playing] The sea is boiling! [man] What? The sea is boiling? [man 2] What's that? Dark clouds will roll in soon. We must fold the sails, now. [crew] Fold the sails! Fold the sails! Not yet! -[man 3] Don't do it yet. -Not until I say so. If we mistime it, we'll be swept into the Sea of Fire! [Hae-rang sighs] Trust me, Captain. Do tell. How does the former captain not know Bongaesum, but knows the Sea of Fire? I was swept into it by a rainstorm when I was young. And this rising haze looks just like it did then. The Sea of Fire appears after passing Bongaesum. Even a ghost would die there, but you survived? I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't. I've heard that hundreds of thousands of dragons live in the Sea of Fire, so… You've seen a dragon? When you see it for real, it's not dragons, but huge pillars of fire. Hundreds and thousands of pillars of fire piercing the sea and surging into the sky! [man] The black clouds are rolling in! [suspenseful music playing] [crew murmuring] We must hurry and fold the sails. If we lose the sails, we lose everything! I just said not yet! I know the way. Huh? Everyone out of the way! Lightning! [crew yelling] Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches! Fold the sails! Get out! [crew screaming] Keep your heads down! We're all gonna die! [A-gwi] Captain! [both grunting, struggling] Captain Mak-yi, take the wheel! You know the way! Captain Mak-yi! The wheel is spinning by itself! Captain Mak-yi, go quickly! [crew screaming] [crew yelling] [dramatic music playing] We'll all die up here! Get below deck! [crew] Go down! Go down! If the boat fills with water, you'll all die! Don't go below deck! [Kang-seop] Get back up! Get back up! [grunting] [Mu-chi] Tie yourself with rope. Captain Mak-yi, give the order! Do that! Do that! If the ship wrecks, you won't be able to escape! Don't tie yourself! Just hold on! Hold on! Everyone, follow Rang's orders! If you just keep your mouth shut it'd be fine Wu Mu-chi! [Mak-yi screaming] That's what they're for, captain? As expected of our captain! [laughing] [crew laughing] [lightning cracking] [electricity crackling] [epic music swelling] [choir vocalizing] [inaudible] Hold on tight! [Mak-yi screaming] [Mak-yi] Help me! [Hae-rang grunting] Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches! [A-gwi] Quickly! Go! [straining] This isn't ten years' worth of lightning! It's like 10,000 years'! [yelling] [Mak-yi screaming] [music crescendos] [screaming] [yelling] [screaming] Pull yourself together! Grab my neck. [choking] Not like that. [panicked breathing] [[Mu-chi straining] [both screaming] -Help! -Save us! Ah, shit! [both breathing heavily] [Mak-yi whimpering] [thunder rumbling] [crew murmuring happily] [panting] [grunting, groaning] [heavenly music playing] [Witless] What? This is it! We're finally here! [Mak-yi] Save us! We're over here! Save us! After the first lightning strike, you get out of the way? Your first storm, huh? He was the first to run away, dammit! -[Gom-chi] Get off! -[Mak-yi] You're all idiots! [crew exclaiming] [eagles screeching] [birds warbling] [Hae-rang] Captain Mak-yi, where's the treasure? We have to find it. We don't have the map. What? It's a small island. If we dig around, we'll stumble across it. [Witless] Small? You call this small? [birds screeching] [man] I ought to kill this fool. What? Why are you all staring at me, huh? You're the leader. When did you treat me like one? Not one of you ever followed my orders, dammit! You all talk behind my back, then put me on the spot when things got dangerous? It's like being a damn slave! That's what being a leader is. You didn't know? He's right. That's insane. Right. Just a moment. [sighs] [humming thoughtfully] -[Gom-chi] He remembers. -[Kang-seop] What is it? I quit being the leader. -[man] I'll crush his head! I'm serious! -[crew groaning] [birds screeching] [ominous music playing] [soldier] Bongaesum ahoy! [soldier 2] Where? [soldiers clamoring] [bird cooing] [Mak-yi] Let go of me! Let go! I'm walking! Boss, this is the land, not the ocean. The dragon is master at sea, but the tiger is on land. [chuckling] So, now I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King… [Mu-chi grunts] …will follow your orders. I've been away at sea too long, Captain. Quartermaster, you dare to lead the way when Captain Mak-yi, who knows the way, is behind you? [Kang-seop] Come here, Captain Mak-yi, in three, two… [Mak-yi panting] [whimsical music playing] It's over there. Looking for something? A stream of water. [sighs happily] You sure are a natural leader. Joo Bang would have done the same. -[insects chittering] -[bird cooing] [man] Hurry! [ominous music playing] [panting] [man 2] These folks sure rest peacefully here. [man] This is why no one's seen Joo Bang since he disappeared. [thunder rumbling] [man 2] By the way, did you solve the riddle, Captain? "Meaning is as deep as the sea, courage is hidden in the dark. Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth." [A-gwi] There's nothing here. [Mak-yi] If you're not gonna trust me, stop digging! The lightning is striking the same place. Now! -[Hae-rang] Hmm. -[Mu-chi] See? It strikes the same place over and over. Just when you think it's done, it-- There! Right now. Whoa. Is there something there? -It seems like it. -But what? -Shall we see? -Shall we? -[man groaning] -[Mak-yi] Don't dig there. Dig right here. [A-gwi] Should we dig more? [digging, scraping] -Dig more. -More? Just a little bit more. [Witless] Ugh. Dammit. Wow. Look at all you've dug! These morons just keep digging because I told them to? [crew murmuring] Something's here! -[man] He found something. -[crew clamoring] Let's bury him here when he comes over. -[A-gwi] Alive? -Hey. You… you've found something? -[Gom-chi] Treasure. -Get that son of a bitch! [crew yelling] [A-gwi] Get that bastard, dammit! [sighs heavily] [Mu-chi] I'll go on my own. Gold is truly amazing. [Mu-chi] Hmm? I've never seen you doing something without someone ordering you to. [sighs] It's because you want it. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. Or stayed on that damned sea at all. [twinkling] [soft music playing] [sniffing] The first time I saw you, I thought you were the angel of death coming for my soul. [chuckles lightly] My heart fluttered thinking of a death with you. I was happy to be dying. [Mu-chi breath shuddering] Eat this if you're hungry. [retching] [clears throat] [gasping] Wow! This, uh… Delicious. Hmm. Mmm. Thanks so much. Don't mention it. [thunder rumbling] [Mu-chi panting] [grunting, groaning] -[birds screeching] -[grunting] [breathing heavily] [birds screeching] [lightning cracking] [grunting, panting] [ominous music playing] [chains clanking] [Mu-chi] "Traitors." [lightning cracks loudly] [gasping] [electricity crackling] We've come to the right place. Yi Seong-gye. Jeong Do-jeon. And that's Left State Counselor Cho Min-su. All the founders of Joseon are all gathered here. [laughing] Those were the twelve traitors of Goryeo. Pull out the spear of the one that served his majesty and dig underneath it. Go pull out the spear! -Now! Move faster! -[laughing] [man] I said move it! Go! Pull the spear out, now! [screaming] [man] Pull out the spear, now! There will be a greater reward for those who show courage! You heard him! Pull out the spear! Get a move on! Hurry! [man 2] If you run, you're dead! -[soldiers clamoring] -[blades swishing] [squelching] -A trap? -It's a trap! Get back! [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music playing] Choe Yeong. YEONG [Mu-chi] The last general of Goryeo who fought against Yi Seong-ye. That's General Choe Yeong's flag. Choe Yeong. Goryeo's last general surrounded by the founders of Joseon. That's the one. [thunder rumbling] [chains clanking] [man] Captain, the apparatus! The apparatus! [Heung-su straining] [yelling] [man] It worked! Of course, that's the one. [all laughing] [whimpering] [waves sloshing] [grunts] [chirps] [gasping] What are you? A bird or a fish? [chirping] What? Gold! Unbelievable! [Mak-yi grunting] There really is gold here. [whimpering] Mak-yi, you ass! I can't believe you. If I find you, I'll tear off your head! I found it! I found the gold! [Witless] He found it? Where? Over here, you jerks! -I found it! -Where's the gold, Captain Mak-yi? -There. -Where is it? You found it? [crew murmuring] Where is it? [Mak-yi muttering] That little… You better get back here! Enough. Who are you talking to? First mate… [panting] …it was like a bird that looks like a man. Or a man that looks like a bird-fish thing. This creature had a huge piece of gold in it's mouth. He was right here, like this. [imitating chirping] I call bullshit! The last straw. -[Gom-chi] Kill him! -I'm tired of this! [crew cheering] [screaming] That lying mouth! [crew muttering] -What is that? -What is that? -[chirping] -[Kang-seop] Gold. [Mak-yi] Did you see? [epic whimsical music playing] [Mak-yi] Did you see? Do you believe me? Do you believe me? [crew clamoring] [penguin chirping] Then hurry up and find it. The gold is waiting here for us! If you can't take it from here, you're not worthy to be a pirate! Let alone a jellyfish! [crew] Yeah! -Find it! -[Mak-yi] Find it! [screaming] [penguin chirping] [whimsical music playing] [Witless] Where did you get it? Say something already! Are you asking the bird? Bird? You still don't get it? Here. Give me that. Watch this. [imitates whooshing] -[chirping] -[Witless laughing] [whooshing] [Witless] You saw that, right? You saw that? When have we ever seen an animal that wants gold? Have you? Have you? -[man] No. -I haven't neither. You might fool the others, but you can't fool a former merchant. Are you saying that is actually a person? Ugh. This is so damn frustrating! Come on. Say something while we're still being nice. Where did you get that gold, huh? I'm being nice. [metallic scraping] Do you have to bleed to start flapping that beak? [grunting, groaning] I've never seen someone as stupid as you are. [laughing] Forgive him, birdie. I, Captain Mak-yi, apologize for this rotten bastard crewmember. Could you tell us where your leader is? -[chirping] -[explosion] [crew muttering] -[Kang-seop] What is that? -[explosions] It's a cannon. [crew gasping] Captain, the government ship. [Gom-chi] The ship's here. [soldier] Fire! [cannonball whooshing] [crew grunting] [screaming] [whimpering] Huh? [soldiers] We found it! We found it! -[soldier] Pull it up. Hurry! -[soldiers laughing] It actually exists. [soldier] Pull it up! Yeah! [cannon fire] [soldiers muttering] [chuckles] The little rat. [bow stretching] -[grunting] -[arrow whooshing] [electricity crackling] [Mu-chi grunting] [groaning] [suspenseful music playing] Wu Mu-chi. -[thunder rumbling] -[groaning] [straining] [laughing] [sniffing] You've done a good job finding a treasure that belongs to someone else. And who is that? Me. [all laughing] Leave it to us to cut off that crazy bastard's head! [intense music playing] [soldier yelling] [straining, yelling] Don't stop now! Fire! [man laughing] [crew screaming] -[cannon fire] -[crew marveling] [Kang-seop] What do we do? Captain? [lightning crackling] [cannon fire] [chirping] [Hae-rang] Listen up. Whether you die fighting with me today, or turn your back and live in regret for abandoning us, the choice of where you die is yours to make. But I promise you as a captain, I have no intention of dying on this island. And I won't let any of you die on this god-forsaken island either. Captain, I will stay with you! [crew] Me too! Me too! Captain, we must stay together from now on. [Kang-seop] You live life only once. Let's have our way with gold and welcome our fate! Yeah! [man] Let's take down the government ship! [Witless] And find the treasure too! -[crew shouting] -[chirping] Okay! Let's take the government ship now! Quartermaster, go rescue your boss. Draw the enemy's attention until we take the ship. As former bandits, we're good on land. Let's climb that mountain, find our boss, and have a long overdue reunion! -[man] Let's go have some fun! -Let's go! [bandits] Let's go! Let's go! -Let's go! -[pirates] Let's go! Out of the way, man. You're blocking us. [pirates] Let's go! [A-gwi] Forward! [chirping] I thought I was captain. [squawking] Let's go too. [chirping] To find the damn gold! [intense music playing] [woman grunting, gasping] [man] Hae-geum! [Mu-chi grunting] [soldier yelling] [both grunting] -[yelling] -[arrow whooshing] [groaning] [lightning cracking] -[soldier 2] Where's the treasure? -[soldier 3] All that's here are rocks! -[soldiers] Find it! -Captain! [Mu-chi yelling, grunting] Catch him! [yelling] [soldiers marveling] [grunts] Get him! [groaning] "Entrance"? There's another entrance? [bandits fighting loudly] [Kang-seop] Where are you going? Huh? What are you doing? Let's get going! Just come here! [grunting, yelling] Let's go! [sighs] Our teamwork is terrible, seriously! [Kang-seop grunts] Bu Heung-su! [lightning cracking] [dramatic music playing] Do you need this goblin mask? Seems like it's the final key to find the treasure. If you hand it over now, I'll spare your life. You probably don't even have a ship to carry the treasure, anyway. [laughing] Ship? But I only need one ship. If you're not a coward, me against you. Let's duel for the treasure. Just don't run away. [thunder rumbling] [Mu-chi laughing] [sword ringing] [exhaling slowly] -Huh? -Oh. [Mu-chi yelling] [both grunting] [sword slicing] [Mu-chi groaning] [grunting] Stop! This is a leader's duel. [rumbling] [Mak-yi] Can we go a little faster, please? -[explosion] -[screeching] [screaming] Dragons. The dragons are awakening! -[whimpering] -[chirping] -[screeching] -You've been tricking me all along! You bastard! [squawking] You'd better run, you turd! I'll rip your legs off if I catch you! [yelling] [gasping] [laughing] Got you! [muffled grunt] [dramatic music playing] [grunting] [screaming] [intense music playing] [both grunting] Get him! Why have you been trying to pick that up? Just focus on fighting! [grunting, groaning] [swords clanging] [gasping] [yelling] What? [breathing heavily] What's this? [thunder rumbling] [Mak-yi] Huh? It's the same. [ominous music playing] [seagulls warbling] [crew clamoring] [man] I have no excuses, Captain. [man 2] We're alive? We're alive? And Hae-geum? [crying] [rumbling] [explosion] [breathing heavily] [explosion] [arrow whooshing] -[grunting] -[soldiers marveling] -[arrows whooshing] -[soldiers grunting] There's pirates! -[arrow whooshing] -[grunts] [rock music playing] [soldiers clamoring] [Hae-rang grunting] -Prepare to die! -You're all dead, dammit! [straining] Lose some weight. -[grunting] -[squelching] [Hae-rang grunting, groaning] [whimpers] [chirping] [grunting] [straining] [exhales sharply] [wondrous music playing] [Mak-yi yelling] I found the treasure! Whoo! I found the treasure! I found the… -[clattering] -[coins clanking] [penguins trilling] Wait. So… Ah, shit. [Mak-yi sighs] Birdies, just listen to me. I'm not saying I'm going to keep this all for myself. I'm saying, first, let's get off this island, huh? Then we divide it evenly. You should know I have an enormous number of subordinates, okay? [penguin warbling] If I get caught here dillydallying… It's… it's a waste of my-- Ow! [penguin laughing] How dare you! [penguin chirps] [groaning] [penguins clamoring] You're pushing your luck! I'm the Pirate King-- Huh? -[penguins clamoring] -[groaning] [Mak-yi yelling] [screaming, grunting] [groaning, screaming] [yelling, grunting] [soldier yelling, grunting] [sword slicing] -[soldier yelling] -[Hae-rang grunting] [explosion] [water hissing] [Hae-rang grunting] [retching] [grunting, groaning] -[sword slicing] -[squelching] Captain, the ship, it's in terrible condition! We have to stop fighting and repair it immediately! [soldier groaning] [swords clanging] [exhales sharply] [breathing heavily] [tense music playing] [both grunting] -[Hae-rang groans] -[soldier yelling] We must repair the ship. If this ship sinks, we'll all die! You're about to die, anyway. So why do you care? [Hae-rang groaning] [soldier yelling, grunting] [soldier grunts, groans] [Hae-rang straining] [soldier yelling] [groans] [groans] [breathing heavily] [men clamoring] [dramatic music playing] [ship creaking] [screaming] [penguins squawking] [screaming] [swords clanging] [soldier grunts] [whimpers] I've returned. I'm here to save you all! It is I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King! [screaming] [lightning cracking] -[swords clanging] -[grunting] [intense music playing] [screaming] Throw away your sword! [grunting, groaning] [wind whooshing intensely] [Kang-seop] Hold on tight. -Hold on tight. -[Witless] What's happening? Is a phoenix taking off this time or something? Get down quickly! [lightning cracking] [man grunting, groaning] Hey. You okay? [rumbling] Why do I see two ships? You too? Yeah, but what's that sparkly thing? Did Joo Bang's ship survive? Is that all gold in that ship? Well, look at that. That's enough to build a new kingdom. [dramatic music playing] [men clamoring] [penguin squawking] Gold! [Hae-rang grunting] Kill them all. Kill them all! Everybody, cross over! -[soldier yelling] -[Hae-rang grunting] Captain! -[soldier] Shoot at them! -Hurry, Captain! [soldier] Fire! [Gom-chi] Captain! Let's go! -Captain! -No! [Gom-chi] Captain! [cannon fire] [Hae-rang yelling] [crew clamoring] [yelling] [Mak-yi] I got you! [Hae-rang grunting] [grunting, moaning] [man] Captain! Captain! Hey, hey. Don't touch there. It hurts! [moans] God. I almost died. The captain's okay! Yeah! [crew cheering] [Hae-rang groans, strains] I'm still the captain! [Gom-chi] It's starting again. After a battle against countless dragons in a sea cave, I brought these treasures. [crew murmuring] How many dragons were there? 3,873. Now that we have the treasure, it's time to go home! Let's go home! [laughing] [rumbling] [suspenseful music playing] [explosions] [Gom-chi] What's that sound? -[explosion] -[crew gasping] [man] What was that? [deep rumbling] A horde of dragons has awakened. [sea roaring] [crew screaming] [Mak-yi groans] [crew screaming] [ratcheting] [grunting] Raise the sails! [Hae-rang straining] [Hae-rang groaning] [crew clamoring] [breathing heavily] [intense music playing] [straining] [grunting] [soldier yelling] [laughing] [yelling] [both grunting] [crew marveling] [crew yelling] [breathing heavily] [crew clamoring] [breathing heavily] [crew yelling] [grunting, groaning] [choir vocalizing] Captain! When I give the signal, be sure to secure the sails! Yes, Captain! Everyone, get ready! [A-gwi] Pull yourself together, men! Now pull! Pull! [straining] [screaming] [straining] [yelling] [Gom-chi] Someone help me! [screaming] [music crescendos] [spluttering] [Mak-yi] Are we alive? [A-gwi] This must be the afterlife. -[crew groaning] -[Hae-rang groaning] [wincing] [panting] [Mak-yi] We're alive! We're alive! We're alive! We're alive! [crew celebrating] [dramatic music playing] So you made it, Captain! 'Cause it's my turn now! Don't die on me, Wu Mu-chi. [panting] If I die on this mountain, will Rang remember me? I wonder. [both yelling] -[sword piercing] -[Mu-chi groaning] [bandits screaming] [Mu-chi gasping] [struggling] In the end, the strongest always wins. [breath shuddering] [thunder rumbling] Wu Mu-chi! [rock music playing] [Mu-chi grunting] [groaning] [electricity crackling] [yelling] [Heung-su screaming] [electricity crackling] [groaning] [triumphant music playing] [crew clamoring] [cheering] -Boss! -Kang-seop! [laughing] Wu Mu-chi succeeded as well. Look at this! [Mak-yi] I found the treasure! -[man grunts] -[water splashing] Huh? Hae-geum. [Gom-chi] Is she alive? [A-gwi] Hey. Did you eat yet? [cheering] [chuckling] [seagulls warbling] [music fades] I wonder what happened to Joo Bang. He wouldn't have been able to leave the island without a boat. He's probably asleep on the island somewhere, full of sorrow for his ruined country. [Mu-chi scoffing] What ruined country? Goryeo's been rebuilt. Joseon's it's name, now. A country is its people, the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty. So now that we found the treasure, um… [clears throat] …what's Boss going to do? Boss? Well, if you insist on staying on the ship, I'll have to rethink the leadership then. [crew chatting indistinctly] [chuckles] [soft music playing] -What do you say? -I need to think it over. [seagulls warbling] How long are you going to think about it? [laughing] -[footsteps approaching] -[huffing] [Kang-seop] Your vacation is over… Captain. Attention! Are you really leaving us? Do I have any other choice? You cannot have two dragons on one ship. If it is our fate, I suppose we will meet again. As long as you're still on the sea, Captain. But I'm confused. Where's the island here? I asked to be taken to a safe island. The island is over there. [Mak-yi] Where? [Hae-geum] That island. That's not an island, it's a rock. [crew laughing] We paid particular attention to the safety you mentioned. There are no mountain beasts or wild animals. What's more, no soldiers either. [man] Exactly! I assure you there's no safer place. [Gom-chi] He's right! When there's no fresh water, or room to stretch your legs! There is no place in this world that is perfect. [A-gwi] Exactly! [laughing] Joo Bang, rest in peace. [water splashing] 'Cause we are honest bandits. we'll use it well to help the common folk. [Hae-rang clears throat] So you didn't answer my question. Hmm? Ah. [chuckles] Oh, Hae-rang. -Hmm? -Hey. Just stay still, will you? What? My answer. Are you saying you'll stay? The former Greatest Swordsman chooses to walk alongside you. Idiot. [groans] For me to know, you have to do this. [Mu-chi muffled groan] Captain? [man gasping] [crew clamoring] [man 2] Huh? What? Since when were those two… [Witless] You didn't know? While they were cutting fish heads. [Hae-geum chuckling] What's going on? [A-gwi] Them too? What's the use of treasure, dammit? [man 2] Ugh. I don't need any of this. [crew clamoring] [A-gwi] Please, stop already! Stop! Come on! [upbeat music playing] [singer vocalizing] [funky music playing] [adventurous music playing] [choir vocalizing] [music fades]
