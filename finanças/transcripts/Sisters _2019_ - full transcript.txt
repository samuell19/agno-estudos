We're fated to live in solitude. Because we know something that's impossible to explain to others. This world has more than what we think we know. My mother was both a herbal doctor and a witch doctor. Aunt Sroy is a Krasue. My mother regarded it as a form of sickness. If Aunt Sroy didn't have to hunt, to fight, and if she didn't have sexual relations, the transformation wouldn't take place. It's hard to understand. The day Father told Mother to choose... she chose to take care of me and Aunt Sroy by herself. Do you feel hot? Mother must have been too tired and busy to notice that Aunt Sroy was in love with Uncle Singha. Sroy! - Sroy. - He was the guy who brought herbs to Mother. Aunt Sroy transformed because of him. - Sroy. - Because she was in love. Sroy. Uncle Singha implored that Aunt Sroy was the love of his life. I'm sorry. - I love Sroy. - But Mother wasn't convinced. She learned that Aunt Sroy was pregnant. It was too much for her to fight alone. So, Mother had to teach Uncle Singha everything. The spells... and the herbal medicine. My sister could turn into a full-fledged Krasue, or she wouldn't. It depends on how well we take care of her. If we fail, my sister... will turn into this. When Mother's age-old enemies knew that Aunt Sroy was pregnant, - they came after her. - Kaew. Leave. They claimed that the child was one of their own. Yes, Aunt Sroy became a Krasue because of them. Both Ratree and Duangdao. My mother sacrificed her life, hoping to end everything once and for all. But she failed. She couldn't stop them. We had to run. And we kept running. But it was too much for Uncle. Aunt Sroy fought until her last breath. Her daughter got infected with the cursed blood. And Uncle could never walk again. Uncle tried to reverse the curse. He tried the spells, then the herbal medicine. He believes there must be a way to permanently stop my sister's transformation. No one knows if it's possible. I've been trained very hard because it's my responsibility. No one knows if I will succeed... until that day arrives. My name is Veena, daughter of a herbal and witch doctor. What I dream about, what I want to do, will mean nothing if I can't save my sister. That's her, Mora. My sister. Soon, she'll be 16. That age is critical for us. I have to go through this. I must save my sister. I don't know if I can pull it off. But I'll give it everything I've got... because we only have each other. There are only a few days left and you're still drawing. I told you I have to submit a portfolio. They require ten drawings this year. I don't have much time for that either. I haven't finished even one. If I fail, I'll have to take a gap year. Whatever. Don't forget, your sister is your priority. 3Uncle! What is she screaming for? So stupid. If you feel lonely, why don't you get a puppy instead of keeping this damn ghost? It's like a screamfest all day long. So noisy. Don't forget to give her the potion. Will Dad allow me to stay over this Saturday? No. Why not? You're better off staying at that house. Why bother coming over? Because you and Dad live there. Then get better quickly. You think I don't want to? You always make a fuss about taking your medicine. Now drink it so you'll be cured and we can be together again. Dad said that? No. I said that. And I'll do everything to make it happen. All you have to do is take your medicine and do as I say. Promise? Promise. I have to go. Text me when you get home. Okay? Uncle. All of this? Seriously? Yes. What about my own things? Like homework. Ditch your drawing and music so you'll have more time. This tastes so good, you'll love it. You have to eat so you'll get stronger, you know. Take this downstairs. Get out. Shh... It's okay. Just hang in there. The person who made you like this... is going to pay. You'll be fine soon. You'll be like before. I promise. I'm sorry to bother you. Singha. We've known each other for a long time. Your daughter is like my own family. Why don't you all come and stay at my house? I'm hardly home anyway. These two girls have to be separated. It's almost time. For Mora's diet, I'll make sure there's no raw flesh. The herbs you require will be delivered here. - Thank you. - Veen. Why is Dad sending me away? Why can't we live together? I don't know. He said there's no other way. Come on. We can call each other every day, right? Here, here. Veen, Veen. Just a sec. Hey! Came for a basketball? No. I was just taking a walk. Taking a walk? In here? Let's go, Mora. We're done here. Next time, you can thank me by giving me your number. What did Kong say? You know him? Hey. I asked you. Don't change the subject. Nothing. He just asked what movie we'll see tomorrow. Who said we'd go see a movie? Come on. Let's go. Are you okay? I'll get you some water. Wait here. What are you doing here? Acne suction? Hey. Mo. Mo. This is so refreshing. May I have some more? I'll make it for you. Are you always like this? I must have been hungry. I could hardly eat anything. My stomach has been feeling weird. Dad, can I stay the night? Hold it. Don't change the subject. Let me check. Open your mouth. Tongue out. Chin up. Dad. Let me stay the night, please. Not possible. It'll be too crowded. Too crowded is better than being too lonely. Please, please. Please, Dad. Off you go now. It's getting late. Veena, take your sister home. - Let's go, Mo. - I want to sleep here. Come on. Don't be a drama queen. Come on. Dad. I miss you. Go, go. Be patient, love. On my birthday, I'll come sleep here no matter what. You think he'll let me? Sure. If it's your birthday, he'll want us to be together. What birthday present will you give me? Mo. Mo! - Give me back my child! - Veen! Veen! - Veen! - Give me my child! Give me my child! Mo. Mo. Mo. Mo! Can you get up? Hurry, get up. Run, Mo! Run! Give me back my child. I want my child! Go away! - Be gone, devil! - Give me back my child! Uncle, I'm staying here tonight to keep Mo company. Uncle, why... Why did she attack Mo? I've never seen her so aggressive before. Pregnant ghosts are archrivals. They become fierce when they sense one another. Don't worry. I've blocked it with a spell. Never thought I could do it. Are you sure your spell is strong enough to keep it away? She's still wailing like hell. Your mother would've silenced her completely. But you're lacking practice, you didn't learn all the spells. Don't let it happen to your sister ever again. Understand? What did she do to you? I don't know. I was in a daze. But I remember fighting her. Right. But how? I can't tell. All I know is... I'm-- I'm scared. Never mind. Forget it. Leave it there. Forget it. Veen. - What? - What exactly is that thing? It's... Why do you and Dad have to live in that hellish building? And why do I have to live with a stranger? Why can't the three of us find a place to be together? Why do we have to be separated? Be patient. We'll be together soon. Let's go to bed. Veen. What's wrong with me? You're sick. I don't know much. You have to ask your dad. I'm scared. Don't be. It's okay. I'm right here. I won't let anything happen to you. Hey, wait up! Mora's not here? She's sick. - You two are sisters, right? - Right. But you don't look like each other. I guess. Phone number, please. I mean, Mora's number. 063... 0808013. Thanks. Hey, Veena. Can I have your... your number. Did she text back? HI, IT'S ME, KONG. Come on, pick up. I don't want to do it. Can we think it over? I'm scared. Call me back. I'm here for the special acne removal. First time? Your first time? You're scared, aren't you? Uh... It's just like an ant's bite. You'll be fine. Ready? Yes. Hello? Mook. Sorry it took me a while. Don't do it. Come back. Okay. Uh, I'm sorry. I've changed my mind. I've already got twins from a first pregnancy. Eat them to pick up your strength. Yes, it's a matter of time. Little sis, soon you'll be as beautiful as before. Now, enjoy your meal. When we get a new body, you'll be complete. Soon, right? Very soon, sis. The smell is getting stronger every day. Follow them. - Come here! - Veen, where are we going? - Just come with me. - Let me go! - Mo! - Veen! - I said come! - I said let go of me! What are you doing? Let me go! - What's going on, Veen? - Hurry up! Let me go! I'm tired! - Where are we going, Veen? - Hurry up! Let me go, Veen! What's going on? Veen! Veen. Why are we running? Just keep running. Ouch. Why, Veen? - It's my first day out! - To Park Kred. Go! - Don't come around here again. - Why? Just do what I say. - You're my dad now? - Don't be so childish, Mo. Did you hear me? - Did you hear what I said? - I did! I'm not deaf! I'm just sick with some damn disease. And I'm sick of living with strangers. Can't do anything! Can't go anywhere! Can't eat anything! - I'm sick of everything! Sick! - Mo! Tomorrow, wait for me in front of the school. Be on time. Don't make me wait. No. I don't care what will happen to me! - I won't follow your orders anymore. - Look. Everything I do, it's all for you. There's nothing in it for me. Then don't do it. No one's forcing you to. Veen, no one tells me what exactly is wrong with me. But I sense it's something wicked. I know I'm not normal. But this is my life. And if I can't be with anyone, I accept that. Easy for you to say after all these years. Everyone has fought hard for you, so you should too. I understand how sick you are with everything. I feel the same. But don't say we'll never be together again. See you tomorrow after school. Come on time. Veen, where are we going? Just keep running! I was so scared. I didn't know what to do. There must've been three or four of those monsters. "Monsters"? Your sister is one of them. Your aunt too. Right. I forgot. What am I supposed to do? So that means... Do they live among us? Yes. There are probably more of them than we first thought. They live in packs. They reside in host bodies. They can communicate and locate one another. That means they'll know where to find Mo, right? As the moment approaches, Mora's smell is getting stronger. Why don't you send me to protect her? You have your own smell, Veena. The smell of witchcraft and protective spells. They fight each other off. And these days, you and Mo are at odds. The situation is getting ripe. Your quarrel today is a sign. What should I do now? What if I can't save her? What if she completely turns into one of them? Mo and I, can we be together then? Your mother spent her life taking care of her sister. Every night, she kept vigil to guard her sister from wandering off and feeding on filthy stuff. When one's a Krasue, the other suffers too. If you think you can't save Mo, you have to ask yourself... if you can do the same thing that your mother once did. Don't go back there. We still have time because they're still waiting for Mo. Don't let her out of your sight. Prepare yourself. Practice all the spells. Take the inner organs out. Draw what you see and write down anatomical terms and functions. Put everything in your paper. Okay, we'll resume after lunch. You deserve a smack in the head. I thought you weren't coming. What? I asked you to come here. Asked me? We just chatted on the phone. Remember? Can I see it? Here. Mo, R U FREE TPODAY? NO, I'M NOT. 555 SERIOUSLY? ANOTHER DAY, OKAY? MEAN GIRL! WHAT! 555 MISS YOU. MISS YOU TOO. JUST A SEC. My new number. Ask again and I'll go anywhere with you. - Peek-a-boo! - Hey! - Where were you? - A secret. You disappeared, you didn't answer my calls. Now drink this. I've had to carry it around all day. Nope, today I feel energetic and super-refreshed. Let's have some ice cream. No. Drink your medicine and we'll go home. I have something else to do. Um, like what? Chatting with Kong? I hung out with him today. He's a cute guy. I adore him. But he got the wrong number. So who are you trying to protect? Me or him? No one. Are you sure? Then I'm going to date him. Whatever. It's not my business. Are you sure, Veena? Mo! Okay, no ice cream for me. Only Kong. I mean, I'm allowed to date Kong. See you tomorrow, my sister. Give me back my child! What the hell? Let me explain. Why did you let her out? Why are you doing this? If you're scared of her, how can you fight assassin-ghosts? She is harmless, but those are real killers. - They can hurt you. - Killer or not, a ghost is a ghost. You don't have a choice. Neither have I nor Mora. Time is running out. If you keep drawing and listening to music, how can you save your her? Listen to me. Lay off everything. And focus on your mission. Understand? If I was the sick one, would you ask Mora to do the same? Would you have her train so hard and forget her own life? Would you ask her to abandon her dreams? Would you beg her to give up everything for me? Will you ever love me, your niece, as much as your own child? Veen! KONG BLOCK Here. Drink it. For your headache. I'd carried you in my arms... before I even had Mora. I'd called you daughter... before I had my own daughter. Honestly, it pains me to see you living a hard life. But it's our fate... and we can't change that. I got it. I'm just tired. I just want some time for myself. And I'm scared. Scared that I might not be able to help Mo. I have a plan. It could work. Go to bed. All right? Go to bed, my girl. They've gone to the mall. Who? Kong and Mora. Probably wore each other out. Who? You and your sister. No one wants a burden, and no one wants to be a burden. Agree? Well... it's too late. Wait. Where did you say they're going? The mall opposite the school. Really? Mora. Are you okay? Mora? The first time always hurts. Wait, please let us in. What the hell? Exactly as I thought... you want to destroy us. In fact, I want to cure you. What we are is incurable, Singha. We're either dead or alive. But, no, we don't want to die. And we're not suffering. Except some of us can't accept what we are... like your wife. My sister and I have been waiting for a long time. Waiting for your daughter... to be ready. You... have ruined my sister. Now... you're going to pay... with your daughter's body. Pack your things! They've taken Mora! You forgot your tumbler. Easy. You'll figure something out. Hey! What's that? You. Can you do me a favor? Sure. Keep the doors open. You must not let them close. Never. If you hear anything, ignore it. Don't poke your head out to look. If I say it's all right, it's all right. If you don't hear from me, just go home. Leave right away. Got it? Don't try to look for me. You'll be fucking dead. Never, ever let the lift close. Okay. Just press the button. Just press the button... Shit! Damn it! Is everything all right? Two heads are better than one. Trust me. Fewer heads are better in this case. Trust me. But it's late and it's dangerous. She looks very much like her mother. Strange, you remember her face. I remember everyone who hurt me. Too bad I didn't get to see that prick Singha suffer. But you can inflict pain on his daughter. And also his niece. Don't use up your strength. You'll need it to migrate into a new body. Do you think it'll work? Of course. It has to work. Go get ready. Soon we'll walk together during the day. And hunt together again at night, Duangdao. Mo! Mo. Wake up. Mo. Mo. Let's go. Go get them. Let go of me. Veen. Mo. Mo! Mo! - Mo! - Veen. Let go of me. Let go of me. Veen. Mo! Don't! Let go of me. Mo! Mo. Stay strong. You'll be as good as your mother. And you'll become Mo's guardian. Stay strong. I promise we'll be together again. Veen, I'm scared. Don't be. It's okay. I'm right here. I won't let anything happen to you. Promise me, my sister. Mo. Mo. Mo... To part with someone without a chance to say goodbye is the most painful farewell. I know my sister is out there, but she doesn't want to see me. No one wants to be a burden. I always wanted my life back. I always wanted to be free. I thought I would be happy if I could follow my dream. Now I know that happiness is to see someone you love happy. To smile together. To cry together. I'm drawing. I'll call you back. Even when the world is crumbling, it's still happiness. That's Mora, my sister. The person I love the most. Mo! Mo! There are only two of us... in this whole world. Mo! Mo! Mora! Mora! Mora! Mo! Mo! Mora! Subtitle translation by: นิธิศ สุนทรหงส์
