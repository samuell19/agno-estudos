Now turn left. I repeat, left. Yes Boss. I repeat, boss. -He says you drive well. -If I don't move! It drives me crazy not being able to hear the engine talking to me. Putting on earplugs? Am I talking too much? Nein! It is a miniature transmitter. New model! I'm on channel 1. But how do we talk? I know that your French does not incorporate it. but an order is to be carried out, not to be discussed! Yes, but if you have problems ... What do I do? Puedes oirme? 1 hit means yes, 2 no! Do you mind if we keep chatting? That's okay, because ... the closed door makes it easier for me to talk to you. I dare not say some things to your face. Your eyes mislead me. They're so... They are so blue! -What do you mean by "Spring Roll"? -What? It is a code. Now I can't get the translation. When your eyes look at me ... Wow! It is the best Or have I turned around - Part of the method? -You can swear it! Daniel's method! It's good that I open my heart to you. It doesn't bother you, does it? �Petra? -Continuous, then? -I don't take it! Have you noticed that I am closer to you now? �No? �Bien! Okay, Petra, I'm going to tell you something that might surprise you ... Ah va ... He's going to screw it up! Well ... from day one, I've known that ... I love you! -Good play! -I told you! Well, I already said it! Now get me out of my misery: is it mutual? So that... 1 hit: yes, 2 no. Change the channel to say dirty things! We are working! -Daniel? Left here, son. -Yes, daddy. He is not one of us. That's clear. He is not one of us. What are you playing? Come on! Ninja! Sorry to be so pessimistic: but I smell something. Smell trap? I don't smell anything. What about you, sir? It's weird how those trucks are parked. Fair space for a car! No, it is not a trap. I have checked the map. There is no catch here. -Drive! -If you say so... I should know. Well, I'm never wrong! A trap! What is wrong with him? Which page? This is not on my list. To take off his hat! Luckily it's not my taxi! �Petra! What has happened? Where is the japo? Some Ninjas ... came and the secretary left ... What? Didn't it fly away? He did it! And at such a speed that he must already be on his way to Mars! Ask the Atlas. You must have located it! �Alerta General! �Alto! �Policia! �Mierda! Complicated city, huh? Small streets! The jails aren't much bigger! Get down! I'm a prime shooter so no tricks! �Hablais franc�s? Warning: voy to shoot! We separate! Is that how you want to play? Okay! Where are they now? Didn't they fly off? Where is Emilien? Emilien? I think it's in the trash. I was about to catch them, but I was outnumbered. - They have taken the Secretary! -Which one? To the Japanese, not to ours. It's a disaster! Yes, and they also have Petra. Okay. She speaks Japanese, at least she won't feel so lonely. Lilly, I'm coming. Your father made me stay! But it has been for 2 hours. I'm all hot - Everywhere? -yes, everywhere! It will start to burn within nothing. I'm going. Watch a documentary It will calm you down something! -I'll be there in 5 minutes. -Too long! 4 minutes! Emilien! It's my fault for leaving her down the toilet. -You should have walked in with her. -I thought so. I did think about it, but ... Haven't you finished scratching yet? You've been scratching for over an hour. Have you found something? Actually yes. Here were several cars. 3 in total. Have you read a lot of Sherlock Holmes to deduce that? You don't have any clues we can start with? We will analyze the tire samples in the laboratory. That will tell us more things. They will have time to swim back to Tokyo! Thanks for everything, but I need my taxi, now. Are you convertible that? We are covered in shit! These clowns are shaving the road. Help us find a clue. Look. Lilly is on fire. It may end up burning. They have my girl. Just give me 2 minutes of your time. Take a look, then I'll take care of it. From below, I saw 3 Mitsubishis. But I am not sure of the model. But it was a new model. Direct tires from Japan. -How can you know? -I'm smelling it. - Fish? -What do you mean? -A restaurant? -Where do you have fish oil? Restaurants and ... ports! They were at the port. Therefore, They were on a ship from Japan. That's why it smells like fish. See? -Now, did they steal the cars? -Easy! Alain! -I'm on it. Okay, put down your tweezers. On Monday morning, they will blow a whistle and you will be directing traffic! �Idiotas! They have not stolen anything at the port. -Bingo! -What? That means you were wrong. Why was the theft not declared? Why? Because they use the warehouse as a base! Sometimes you can get really brilliant! - Allerta General! -No, Emilien I always say that. Tell me again. Lilly, I'm going there! Are you watching TV? No, not anymore. They were running a report on animal sex. Burn the blanket! -Lilly is worried. -Give me that. Tell your mother that everything is fine but I need to requisition your friend. They need help. And he has done a great job. Good recruit. He will take me home. You can say good night. Bye, honey. Come on, let's go. The mission is not over. What happens to Gibert? No idea. He's been on the toilet for a long time making weird noises. Really! -What's wrong? -I can not tell you. It's ... too horrible! -No vendr.n, Emilien.-Que? I think this was his first base. They left. Long ago. Suspect approaching. Asian male. They always go back to the crime scene! Police Academy, First Lesson. To your posts! -Captain? -The suspects are approaching the front door. Perfect! I am ready to receive them! Hey Marco, are you sure about all this? What? It is the coup of the century! There is a mountain of videos in their boxes and about to be distributed. They are about to force entry. -We got them! Emilien! -Do you force the entrance of your house? -Clear. -Ah, yeah? -In agreement. No. Uh-oh! Are you going to ...? Chief. I like to be around my men. Some action won't hurt me. Like the old days! -A long time ago. -The memory is distant, Emilien ... -but the reflections are still intact! -Creame... �Gracias! - Are you sure there are no cops? -Relax, Believe it! There is no one here! They're all watching the game, all the cops are in front of the TV. Ready for the attack? Wait for my signal. -I'm worried about you. There is a lot of distance to the bottom. -No problem. -You tie a knot. I will do the rest. -Eh-oh ... See? They are all with the party, just like I said! On the attack! Fuck, fuck! -Emilien? -Okay, boss. -Banzai! Are they stabbing someone? The knot is fine ... Yes. Emilien. It may be the rope. -You took the one that wasn't. -You're right. �Ambulancia! �Ahora! It's all my fault. I should never have left her alone or allowed him to come down. Hey, that's enough. You're crying like a fool! -That won't bring her back. Think about it! -It's me! -Also now we have nothing to guide us! -Ask the right questions. Why didn't the Yakuza kill him directly? -Why do they need you? -Why? -Have they asked for a ransom? -No. Why kidnap him here? Good. They must have a good reason. What was he going to Paris for? To sign contracts. Security, trains, army, nuclear energy ... There it is! They may want to stop it. That makes no sense. Why would they want to do that? They are right. Yuki Tsumoto wants to stop him. I know you. Weren't you a stewardess before? I'm here to protect the Secretary. I'm from counterintelligence. It's funny! I'm also ... Emilien, Marseille Police. -This is Daniel. -Internal. I'm learning how to be stupid! Inteligente! Quien es ese tal Yuki Tsumoto? Yakuza. Control the north. Powerful and traditional. Reject airplanes, trains, nuclear energy ... France is willing to sell, and he takes action. Neither the Secretary nor Japan will ever sign! Tsumoto has sent 2 masters in hypnosis. The Secretary, at the appropriate time ... Will someone shoot maybe the same President. Would France sever all its diplomatic ties for years? -Exactly. -What madness! -We have to release your friend and the secretary before 11. -We don't have much time left. Clear. I'd better tell my boss. The cripple or Sleeping Beauty? Okay. Listen ... you both have things to save. As we are in a bind, we better not disturb the powers that be. -�No? -�Bien! No Japo is going to beat us! Excuse me! Where do we start? First, could you find them in Paris? -There is no way. -It's easy! Child's game! Thanks, Joe. You saved my life! Goodbye, buddy! I have found them. They hide in the south of Paris. Are you sure that is her? hey, they! 3 black Mitsubishis with a blonde. Ok? OK OK. There is not much time left. To the airport! There are no flights in the next 3 hours. We can not wait. We must get there at once! Think! Get up! It's war! -The men! -It's me, Daniel! Daniel! What about the troops? They have gone! It's only us left to save the day. You are in my debt. - Afirmative! -I need your help. Fuck! What are they doing? Great! Free way! I really hope you know what you are doing. Because I don't! -Do you have a better idea? - Right now? No. Well, think fast! -I got it! Let me out. -Too late! -Are you fresh? - You can swear it! Cool as ice! You just have to yell, okay? Okay, I'm screaming! We have lost a parachute! There are 3. 1 or 2 They always break down! Ah good! -Emilien. Did you get your license? -Yes. -Then, get here. -Come on, move! -I will direct. -Where am I going? All straight! -All straight? Okay! -Okay! Whatever you say. Venga, relajate. Se m�s "zen". That's OK. Really good. Oh, Lilly, are you okay? -Who is the one that gurgles? -Stewardess. - Stewardess? -No, a nurse! -Are you in a massage parlor? No way, Lilly! We are in heaven. Your father is leading us. Emilien is at the wheel. I am fixing a parachute and the nurse is singing to reassure us. That's it! Have you smoked a tree?!? Lilly, listen to me. I'm trying to save Petra and the Secretary of Japan! I'll call you as soon as we land! Damn it! -Are you okay, honey? -Perfectly What a mess! Try turning a bit to the left. Now turn left. I repeat, to the left. �Hola! Nothing happens! Tranquilicense! Marseille Police! On the go! -Do you know them? -Yes. An old student. Well, I'm walking home. - Que tal ?, Lionel. -Jacques. -Mr Coutta. Hello. -How are you? -All ready, Coutta? -The only thing missing is the Secretary of Japan. I see it! God, she's gorgeous! -I mean, it looks good. -And the Secretary? Good. He is doing exercise. Now we know where they are. -Maybe we should get them out. -I have an idea. But we should let your friend know. -It won't be easy! What an asshole I am! -You see? Your mini-transmitter! �Petra! Are you ready to kill? Do you hear me? Petra? We are not that far. Get up, and take a turn. Show me your hands. -What is happening? -It's not me. -�Idiota! Sit down. We're going over there. -That is said quickly! -I have a plan. That is what worries me! You will only hear what I tell you ... Me obedecer�s. You will only do what I tell you. I want to go home... You are going to fall asleep. Raise your hands. Con-nichon-a! Hey, now it's my turn! Come on! I'm not bad at hypnosis! �Sentaos! �Bien! Now face down! Good very good. Now go to sleep! Quietecitos or you will sleep too! Perfect, I cover them. Hey girls, what are you doing? Needless. I've already covered them. -It's not loaded. -What is this? How has it happened? It was me. Empty the magazine yesterday. So ... has it never been charged? That way you wouldn't hurt yourself. I'm late. Help me! No problem, I'll figure it out. -Jump there! -Are you sure? -I don't want to fall! Get those clowns! Fancy some sushi? There is no way out, Daniel! The Japs are closing in! One less! We will go out here. We carry too much weight. They are good! Ask your colleagues for help. Forget it. The Paris police hate us. Never help us. - Never asked politely! -What the...? Hey, fagots, aren't you at the parade? Soldiers weren't your thing? Wouldn't you be better off in a little house gobbling like pigs? Would you like to go to a "parade of love"? Fuck me if you can! -You've gone a bit far! -Don't worry! They love it! Catch him alive! I'm going to kill him in person! Where are you? Where is Trocadero? You have to change at Chatelet! A bus! Oh, the Eiffel tower! Off the grass! -�Adelante! -�OK! -There's one! -Catch the taxi! -Kamikaze! -Kami ... what? �Kamikaze! �Banzai! I can't get them off me! We carry too much weight! -I'll go out! -No, I'll try again! -I can not. -Call the general. -General! Loud and clear! How is your trip going? Passing as we can! You have to block the Dauphine tunnel. We will catch them! Give me 5 minutes. -�Hola? -�Picard? -This is Bertineau speaking. -Sir! -Do you have 1 or 2 reserve tanks? -Of course I do. You better hurry! We are already there. What are you waiting for? That's it, sir, the tunnel is blocked. -4 mins, 32. -Well done sir! Hold on tight! -I'm tired of this game! -Do you prefer to be shot? I don't want to crash into a tank! Daniel I would like to spend some time with Petra before I die! Do not worry. I'm going to take you to heaven! I prefer to stay here, on earth. You scared me again! Maybe one day you'll trust me! You are wonderful. He wants you to be his driver in Japan. Right now, I just want to go home. Yes, let's go home. Do you want us to drop you off somewhere? -Not the TV! -only five minutes I want to see your father. It looks like Daniel's taxi. It's great. �Emilien? Well ... it's a new model. A ... camouflage taxi I will leave you at the booth. This place gets on my nerves.
