Charles Charles Come and play Come and play or I'll make you pay If you knew what I've done... If you only knew - I deserve the worst - Please... Who are you? You're here to kill me Kill me Why is your hand around my neck? The traces must be removed Please, sir... ...take off my medallion I've had it since my first communion Idiot Have no fear, Mr Thief I'll submit to anything you want JUST BEFORE NIGHTFALL - Sir? - Whisky, please - Perrier with that? - No, thanks Another, please Charles What's the matter? Are you incognito? No. My eyes ache since morning It's funny that you know this bar No, I happened to be passing by, I was thirsty I came to see the lawyer about my father's estate I could have given you a lift this morning if I'd known We could have lunched together I tried to get Laura at the shop, she was out Your dark glasses make an impression It's not so pleasant I'm blind with them, but they do help my eyes Be careful I ended up having lunch alone in a dump near the lawyer Very gloomy I had lunch alone as well If you're through, I'll take you back - What have they got in their skulls? - Sawdust Funny we should meet in that caf? Why don't you have a car? I'm prejudiced. It would be the end of everything - Doesn't H?l?ne mind? - H?l?ne? She couldn't care less. She has her motorcycle The truth is you're completely eccentric Maybe It's true, your eyes are red You should see an oculist It's getting better - Evening, Jeannot - Evening, M. Tellier, M. Masson Have you seen my wife? She was bringing you a poker Yes. A poker and a pair of bellows. She hasn't passed by yet Two small whiskies Whiskies for the gentlemen You don't look well, M. Masson I'm tired. Too much work Have a drink with us. You too, madam M. Masson is offering us a drink Can't say no to that, M. Masson Answer it. I'll serve - It's for you, M. Tellier - For me? - Yes, it's your maid. It's urgent - OK, I'm coming I spoke to my friend about your son He'll try and see him next week That's really nice of you. He'd love to work in Paris - Here's to you - Cheers - What is it? - Laura had an accident I'm going back to Paris Want me to come with you? H?l?ne will be expecting you. Thanks - Run over? - I'm afraid so - Nothing serious, I hope - Thanks, Jeannot - Call as soon as possible - OK - Don't you want me to come? - No, Charles. Don't worry Everything all right? We've bought some flour to make a cake See you later. Hang on See you later on They're making a cake - Aren't you going to help? - No Josephine, is the chocolate melting? No, not much There you are. You certainly took your time I was strolling along... We're making a chocolate cake - What does the recipe say? - It says, "Take your time" There wasn't enough flour left I phoned the office at 4:00. You were out I had people to see Making chocolate cakes isn't so straightforward You can't do it just like that Look at this What is it? Laura has had an accident - Serious? - I'm afraid so - Don't bother your mother - And Fran?ois? He went back to Paris after he got the call - Will you stop pounding? - What? Because... - Is she in hospital? - I suppose so He promised he'd call Is this Mlle. Maillardi's flat? - I was told to come here - Come in, sir I was told on the phone my wife had an accident Unfortunately, yes - Where is Mlle. Maillardi? - You'll see her - Is my wife dead? - Excuse me, sir M. Fran?ois Tellier? Cavanna, police officer What's happened to my wife? Is she dead? I am sorry to have to tell you. Yes, she is dead Things are more complicated than Mlle. Maillardi said on the phone - She's been murdered - Murdered? What do you mean? By whom? We don't know yet, sir When Mlle. Maillardi came home an hour ago... ...she found your wife dead. Strangled I don't understand Why was my wife here in the absence of... Where is Mlle. Maillardi? You'll see her. She'll explain why your wife was here - You didn't know? - No - What? - Sit down, please You didn't know that your wife was coming here? When did you see her last? This morning, before going to work What is your work? I'm an architect I build houses You knew she was coming to Paris? She is a partner... ...in a small antique shop... ...in the Swiss Village Before we continue you'll have to identify the body I know it's painful, but we have no choice Fran?ois, please, forgive me I never imagined it would end like this - Forgive you for what, Gina? - M. Tellier, please Can you identify your wife? Your cake is delicious - I made it - No, I did Make up your minds - Who whisked the eggs? - I melted the chocolate We'll fight a duel at dawn. Who will choose the weapon? Taste it I may be a monster, but what depresses me is when you look worried - He's the monster - It's true, you know Forgive me. It's a blow though Anyway, you're not a monster Will you stop it, you two? You phoned her twice at the shop? Yes From the lawyer's, then from a caf? Did you get on well with your wife? Yes... in our own way Was your visit to the lawyer's connected with your wife? Not at all. It concerned my father's will Did you ever suspect your wife of infidelity? No She had many friends But I never spied on her Now that you know she had a lover... ...can you think of a name? No What about you, Mlle. Maillardi? You don't know who he is? You never saw him? No I see. You were only the landlady Would you accept valuing? I accept everything, the dictionary doesn't - Well, but you... - No Well, then, I'll put... ...Lingual I've had enough As you like It's 11:30. He won't come now That's what worries me Do you think he's home? - Shall I call him? - He said he'd call. Let's go to bed - Come on, to bed - It won't be easy to sleep It will be for me. Very easy Your games are too complicated It's no reason to make fun of me Sorry, I'm not up to it What are you doing? I won't be able to sleep, I'm taking some laudanum Antique Dealer Murdered in Rented Studio At first there was some scratching. Then... ...and it stopped. So I lay waiting - You were not asleep? - I couldn't It started again all over the ceiling - I'd have been scared - I wasn't. I knew it was a rat - A mouse, perhaps - No, it was a big cross-eyed rat - Did you hear it? - Yes. But I slept We'll get a trap to catch it We put a bit of cheese in it... - Is it like that true, Dad - Yes - With rat poison - Come on, it's time to go H?l?ne. The news about Laura is in the paper She's dead. She was strangled I shouldn't say it in front of the children It's unbelievable. How did it happen? Read the paper. I can't tell you Have you seen Fran?ois? Did you phone him? Let's go, children Josephine... ...l'll drop you off and then fetch you this evening to buy the trap See you tonight I'm dropping by to see Fran?ois Bye, Dad I didn't call you last night The news wasn't very pleasant I know. It was in the paper. You don't have to say anything Apparently she was killed by her lover. It's absurd H?l?ne thought you might like to stay with us for a few days No. I want to stay here Poor H?l?ne must have been shocked She's so far from such things - Can you spare a few minutes? - Yes We'll try to have the funeral here the day after tomorrow - Where is she now? - In Paris They're doing the autopsy Sit down What is it? It's about Laura I don't want you and H?l?ne to think I'm upset because she had a lover... ...or perhaps several Our marriage wasn't like yours and H?l?ne's, you understand? We got on very well, but... ...I led a life of my own, you see It's only natural she should, too I wouldn't want H?l?ne and you to think badly of her I don't want to pass judgment on anyone I have no right to behave like a victim Listen. Count on me if you need anything That's kind of you. You'll miss your train I didn't tell the police we met in that bar But I don't mind at all. If it's any help... How could it be? Here they come... The inspector I saw yesterday. He doesn't waste any time Should I talk to him? See you soon - I'm very fond of you both - We're fond of you, too Here's my magic wand... "Culpa", the washing powder that removes evil stains It's exactly what I wanted It's perfect - What do you think? - It's perfect - And you, Prince? - I'm thrilled The spot's good but I wonder about the slogan The slogan is perfect, believe me Besides, I wrote it I know my customers Good day gentlemen. I know the way You hurt his feelings Not even Culpa could remove all his stupidity - Whisky? - Drinking in the morning now? - Did all go well, yesterday? - So-so You know that not just me, but Lucie and Protov too... ...we all think you're a chicken We're all sure you go to the movies You look as if you could use a drink too - Since last night, I've felt tired - Have a drink then The wife of my best friend, Fran?ois Tellier... ...who built my house... She's dead She was murdered yesterday... strangled - It's in the papers - The antique dealer was his wife? I see why you're shocked You never believe it can happen to people you know I wanted to tell you that there's trouble right here too The cash and the books don't match - What is it? - Gaps. Receipts are missing Incredible What does Bardin say? He says people forgot to give him receipts - It's possible - Of course it is - What do you think? - He's swindling Did you forgot to hand in receipts? I don't know. I couldn't swear I didn't See him... - He's been here ten years - I'll call him Ask M. Bardin to come in - It takes them suddenly, you know - It's embarrassing Why? If anyone can scare him, you can But I don't want to We have to clear this up Let's keep an eye on him. It could be accidental Good morning, M. Masson, M. Prince Come in, M. Bardin. M. Masson wants to discuss yesterday's audit The accountants accuse me of cash errors Yes, I know. M. Prince told me about it The truth is, some receipts for expenses are missing Since they are all careless here I have to take their word - But if later I'm accused of... - I am not accusing you It's very humiliating You mustn't feel humiliated You mustn't feel persecuted Mine is a job of trust, sir If you can't trust me, dismiss me There's no question of it These are routine checks not aimed at anyone. Least of all, you Let's calmly verify... ...these receipts I've quite likely been lax too - May I go back to my work? - Yes, of course This whole thing annoys me I didn't know you were so timid White woman in Apache territory She must be mad Here's Grandma. Don't start asking her for things - Hello, children - Hello, Grandma - Hello, H?l?ne. You look marvellous - You seem to be in great shape I'm not well and doctors are worse It's all in the mind says the new fashion My illnesses are everywhere except in my mind I'm afraid to catch cold You can play by yourselves You could have brought us something I was told you have too many toys - Who told you that? - Your father Now, what did I just tell you? I'll get you some champagne I adore you, you encourage my vices - Will you take your coat off? - Not yet - Want some, Jacqueline? - It makes me sneeze Oh, that's true I'll see to it, dear You're dressed very formally today It's for Laura Tellier's funeral - She's dead? - Yes Three days ago. Didn't you read about it in the papers? What do you mean, the papers? She was murdered. Strangled My God. I didn't associate it. The women murdered by her lover - What a sordid end - Yes She was your and Charles's friend, but I never liked her - Why? She was very nice - No Her upper lip curled up, and that's a sign She was all over Charles. But you're so na?ve, you never noticed Charles didn't notice either You had nothing to fear. Charles adores you Does he adore me as you adore him? We're a happy family and that's priceless - What time is the funeral? - 3:00 - I'll stay with the children - Charles will be back for lunch - Hello, Mother - Hello, darling. You don't look well I should be asking how you are. Seen your doctors? They're so discouraging We're having champagne - Would you like some? - Yes, gladly It's true, you don't look well I do feel upset. Has H?l?ne told you about the funeral? Yes You look feverish Fran?ois has asked us to go to the cemetery. He's coming to get us Of course. Poor Fran?ois You know Charles, a few days ago I was invited at my dentist's I met your friend, Robert Lamour. Do you remember him? Yes. A big strong guy He kept praising you He's in publishing. He read your novel and says you must go on He said wonderful things about you It makes a mother feel so happy Fran?ois, I killed Laura I'll park over there I'm glad you came. I hope you feel better Mlle. Maillardi is a very old friend of Laura's M. And Mme. Masson Oh Lord, who wept over Your friend Lazarus... ...dry our tears, we beseech Thee Lord, who had our sister born unto the life of God Welcome her today into Thy peace, we beseech Thee Thou who experienced death for the love of us... ...so that we might know eternal life... That life of bliss that knows no ending Lord, hear our prayer Grant this mercy to Thy departed servant And may she not be punished for her misdeeds As true faith unites her with the faithful on earth Let Thy mercy allow her into heaven Through Christ our Lord She had no relatives Can I take you home? She's nice, Laura's friend - Had you met her before? - No, it's the first time She was looking at you as if she knew you I didn't notice I don't like funerals The policeman who questioned Jeannot I'm so tired, H?l?ne Come, a drink will do you good That's kind of you, H?l?ne, but you've got your mother, Charles and the kids I'm fine, don't worry I'll take you back - I'm Charles Masson - Yes, of course M. Tellier asked me to look over some of Laura's things It's a bit... gloomy - It must have been horrible - Yes Here's my train - Am I disturbing you? - No, not at all It's early. What's the matter? Forgive me What is it? Did you come to tell me something? - Yes - Come in Would you have a cigarette? I forgot to buy some this morning I lied to you the other evening Partly because I felt guilty. The police were there... I knew Laura was meeting a man in my apartment I can't forgive myself for lying to you Sit down I saw him once Coming back from my work, I saw Laura come out with a man They didn't notice me I had never seen him Now I know who he is I saw him at the funeral. He's one of your friends The man you introduced to me, M. Masson You can't believe Charles killed Laura I don't know, but I did see him with Laura two months ago I realise what it implies Should I mention it to the police? Thank God you came to speak to me about it I can reassure you immediately It's completely absurd Good morning. I'll start with the dishes - Some coffee? - Gladly - How about you? - Yes, please Gina, you can't be sure you didn't make a mistake You had a glimpse of someone at night How can you be sure you're not wrong? I could be, but I'm sure it was him Even if it is him... Even if it is him you saw, there must be a natural explanation There could be a dozen You don't know Charles I've known him 25 years We've been friends for 25 years, we're like brothers He's married to a marvellous woman. He's very happy with her All he thinks of is his family He has the most honest, open mind I know - You see why it's idiotic? - Yes - But you suspect him all the same? - I'm sure it is he I saw, that's all - It's not ready. I'll do the bedroom - Very good. Thank you I shouldn't tell the police? No, frankly Certainly not There's absolutely no reason I ask you not to It would cause unpleasantness, without helping the police One can never tell It might cause a terrible tragedy I remember a news item because an architect was the victim He was innocent But he was wrongly identified He spent most of his life in prison The witness swore he was the man The truth came out 15 years later One can't take such a chance Yes, I understand. You're right I never really wanted to go to the police I was hoping you'd tell me not to go Forget all this Don't talk about it It's too dangerous. It can hurt us all Don't worry. I won't say anything M. Tellier's gone to work He'll be back late. He has a lot to catch up on - How is he? - He is a courageous man Yes, a very courageous man Cold as the North Pole Freezing - The other side - And here? - Still colder - The other side Getting warmer - And here? - Almost lukewarm We're playing hunt-the-thimble You play with Josephine and no cheating He'll cheat - I was thinking this morning... - Yes? Christmas is in three weeks There will be nothing left in the shops So what? We have to buy Christmas presents - You're strange - No, I'm tired You are strange It's not what you think When shall we buy the presents? I don't know... When you like... I'm sorry, forgive me You should forgive me I must have hurt you I wonder what Fran?ois is doing for Christmas Would he like to come here? I don't know. Ask him - Maybe we don't see enough of him - Yes Are you still thinking about what I said? No, of course not I do love you - You're a wonderful husband - Please don't say that Take your arms away. I'm not what you think? I've had an affair with another woman I see. When? Several months ago. But it's been over a long time I was very unhappy I hated lying to you Don't be too upset It hurts a bit But I'm glad you told me You know these things happen... It could've happened to you It didn't occur to me I'll tell you who she was Do I know her? You can't guess? Laura Forgive me - Now you're upset - Was it still going on...? No, it was over - But you'd quarrelled? - No, we were through She fascinated me a while but I didn't love her - I don't think I loved her - No, you didn't love her Your mother guessed she was after you That's why she hated her Let's go back. The children will start wondering - Does it show I've been crying? - No - You went to that apartment with her? - Yes It must have been horrible for you You know, it doesn't really hurt Are you coming? Can you pass the large bauble? - What's the matter? - It's no good It's bad. You're joking. It's not possible - Is yours bad too? - Disgusting It's too bad - What can we eat? - Bread and butter Watch the steps The red one is Josephine's, yours is the one behind You've got the gold one as well - He's got two! - She's jealous What's so funny? - Go over there - She's a wimp Be nice to your sister I'm taking the last one - Merry Christmas - Good evening, Fran?ois Why didn't you spend the day with us? I asked him but he wouldn't I just dropped in to bring the children their presents - Something for me? - Yes, and for Josephine too - Dine with us - I can't I'm flying to London. I'm late already - Bye, H?l?ne - Big hug Me too I'm going to bed I'm tired. Come along, children Charles, do you hear anything? Who's crying like that? - Charles? - Yes - My God, what's the matter? - I think it's a nervous breakdown But you were better lately It was Christmas, but I felt awful What is it? I can't go on. I won't go to the office any more That's not important I can't stop crying, it's horrible - Do you want a doctor? - No You're still upset about what you told me? No It would be silly, you know It's not important. I'm not upset about it I'm glad I told you How about going to the sea? We could ask your mother for the keys to the house and go on our own What about the children? Jacqueline can look after them for a few days Your mother will come here too, she'll enjoy it Don't you think it's a good idea? Yes Feel better now? Yes Do you want to tell me something? No. Nothing No, I feel better H?l?ne, about Laura... - I didn't tell you everything - What did you say? About Laura. I didn't tell you everything - What do you mean? - It was me Come and see Please forgive me I didn't have the courage I couldn't bear being the only one to know any longer Was it an accident? - Don't talk if you don't want to - Yes, I want to I want to tell you exactly how it happened That's what's awful. I can explain exactly how it happened My darling, I'd like you to understand With you, love is simple and clear With her it was a sort of... ...insane drama She forced me... She made me participate It wasn't love, it was violent and humiliating She wanted me to rape her She forced me to be brutal to her That's what was so horrifying It was she who tortured me She took pleasure in seeing me suffer when she made me beat her And me... I couldn't help going back to her One day she told me to put my hands... ...around her neck... ...and to squeeze I put one hand around her neck. She said, "Not like that, both hands "And come on top of me so I can see your eyes while you squeeze" She forced me to put both hands around her neck I shivered when my fingers touched her soft neck Squeeze until I close my eyes I squeeze softly for a few seconds She was half-lying down, completely still... ...and looking at me She hadn't closed her eyes My fingers... I couldn't control them - Please, don't - No, let me go on I am sorry, go on It was like vertigo. I panicked I was afraid that when she would close her eyes I'd go on squeezing So... I let go of her neck I was all in. I'd been so terrified I tried not looking at her, but... ...I didn't manage It was like plunging into an abyss Do you understand? - I think so - No, I don't think you do I don't really think you can I must have crossed the line between fantasy and reality Suddenly, Laura was dead - But you didn't want her to die - Yes, that's right Have the police bothered you? No What about Laura's friend at the funeral? Nothing She would have told the police Then you're not in danger The children... Shall we call them. We'll be home soon Are you feeling better? Much better. I don't feel alone any more You know... there's one thing I was not honest about - It doesn't matter - It does When you asked if I wanted to kill Laura, I answered no I'm not sure that was true Stop torturing yourself. It was an accident I wanted you to know everything Forgive me for spoiling your holiday... ...but something annoying cropped up Annoying is an understatement Anyway, if I'd gone away too we'd be in a mess Take my word for it In short, you are needed urgently Decisions have to be made and my frail shoulders won't carry them I am a bit vague, but I can't say more in a letter See you soon. Regards to your wife, Dominique Prince - We're leaving - What is it? A problem at the office - The cops are here - The cops? Bardin's left with two month's pay roll I called the police. What could I do? Commissaire Cavanna is handling the case I have no right to the rank All policemen are commissaries and all civilians are bosses - You don't seem very upset - Don't rely on appearances M. Masson, I believe? I'm sorry you had to come back for this sorry business Do you have an idea where Bardin could be hiding? No, I don't. I'm flabbergasted You nevertheless suspected something last month I found it hard to believe You nearly apologised to him He's been ten years with us Ever since we started It's almost classic From what I gathered, he fell for a girl two months ago They took off together - But his wife... - His wife and daughter... ...have been left penniless He cashed the family bank account Such things happen without warning I hope they catch the bastard It depends upon his behaviour If he's left France, there's no hope. But they often hesitate They're cowards, frightened by their own actions If he's in France we have a chance. Maybe quite soon I'm optimistic then. The bastard has no guts Don't be too hard on him - What's your opinion, M. Masson? - Me? I don't know I'm trying to understand why he did it. I liked the man - 120,000 francs is a costly liking - He is a crook - You must sign the complaint - Complaint? It's the law You can sign it for me They prefer the boss to sign. It's more legal Aren't you also assigned to investigate Laura Tellier's murder? I knew I'd seen you somewhere You left M. Tellier's as I was entering You have a good memory You too It's not the same thing. The police are always an event True. The police have a certain prestige I was assigned to the state police before Christmas - Do you know M. Tellier? - Yes, of course He designed my house I knew his wife too I should have questioned you It would be a miracle to find whoever did it Don't tell your friend, but the investigation is negative so far All we have are useless fingerprints Now you have mine - How are you? - All right H?l?ne invited me to dinner - Good idea. How are things? - Lots of work, it helps - Is it serious at your office? - Just stupid and sad It's not always the strongest who can stand the most Perhaps... We won't lay the table formally She's not interested in music and yet she plays all the time They never found who did it? Good evening, darling. Good evening, M. Tellier I like a low table. A very good idea It is Charles' idea. He wanted everything modern He made me go further than I would've dared You had an interesting theory I've forgotten I remember. It had to do with your obsession of becoming bourgeois You said, progressive environment kept sclerosis away I'm not sure it's enough - Do you feel bourgeois? - Almost - Liqueur? - Yes I love this white liqueur of yours Your doctor doesn't forbid it? He doesn't forbid anything. He's crazy, he wants me dead Your children behave like adults at the table And when it's bedtime they obey without a complaint They're marvellous I'm in love with Josephine. I'm not impartial Fran?ois... ...when you're ready to go I'll walk back with you a bit You're not throwing Fran?ois out? Good God, no. I was just thinking about something I didn't know what I was saying Taste this I had no intention of leaving yet I'll say goodbye to you as well, darling Goodbye What did you want to tell me? Did you hear my mother's question when we arrived? Yes, I heard The detective investigating the theft at the office... ...told me there was little chance of finding Laura's murderer - You don't know who it is? - No I want you to know I killed Laura I've told H?l?ne everything She refuses to pass judgment. She accepts it, you understand? She only wants to save me I can't bear not being judged I want you to tell me what to do - What you consider right - I don't know Should I give myself up? - Give yourself up? - Yes No, I don't think that's a good idea It would be the correct thing to do No, think of H?l?ne and the kids. It would not change anything But I must pay one way or another I don't know I have no desire for revenge It's so difficult to realise all that I believe it's best to try to forget I committed a crime, Fran?ois. I'm a murderer, do you understand? - I'm a murderer, aren't I? - How do I know? I'm not sure It was accidental or you wouldn't have done it But I think I really wanted to kill her Keep walking - Did you know about Laura and me? - No - You never suspected anything? - No At times I wished you had. It would have ended it Why didn't you tell the police you saw me the day she died? I didn't want them to bother you Why don't you tell them now? Stop talking about giving yourself up Get this idea out of your head I don't consider you guilty No one is guilty of what happens in a nightmare - You think so? - I'm sure of it This story must be buried You must bury it, no matter how But it mustn't be between us any more Do you forgive me? It's not a question of forgiveness. Nothing ever happened The matter is closed I confessed, I unburdened my conscience. And you absolve me You never would have slept with H?l?ne behind my back Perhaps I would have if H?l?ne had been Laura - I'm going home - Yes, do. Goodnight Don't preserve our friendship... ...if you feel it's impossible. It would be a way to punish me See you tomorrow Why didn't you go to bed? Prince called? He told me about Bardin He'll be at the office early, you can go to the police together Bardin was arrested at 8:00 this evening - Already? - Prince was jubilant The fool - Coming to bed? Wasn't it cold out? - Not very At what time do we have to be at the police? - 9:30 - Is Mother in bed? Yes, I was afraid the phone would wake her I told Fran?ois everything - What did he say? - The same as you more or less I thought he would I knew he would. I knew he had no guts He must have felt guilty about leaving his family penniless He sent them a money order They had fled to Orleans Just like a novelette! Adventure just around the corner! Please. You're not funny Can't you be pleased at recovering your money? Here we are Commissaire Delfeil - Do take a seat - Good morning, M. Masson I'm very glad this matter was settled rapidly - So are we - You know how it happened? - Bar... Bar... - Bardin That's right, Bardin was stupid enough... ...to send his wife money from Orleans where he was hiding We had the whole afternoon to find him It wasn't difficult, was it, Cavanna? Let's have him here The young woman I saw sitting outside... She's the 'motive' if I may put it that way She's sweet, but in my opinion, hardly worth it - Is it him? - Oh, yes Bardin Why did you do it? Go to hell You're not going to kiss me? - What about me? - All right Are you all right? - Do you like it? - What? - The music. Do you like it? - Yes It sounds like Stravinsky Do you want a whisky? You look tired I am tired. I'd like a whisky - Your hand is cold - It is cold Couldn't sleep? It's 3:00 in the morning - Haven't you slept? - No, I haven't slept Go back to bed. I'll join you soon I want to stay near you I don't need comforting You can't give me the peace I need All you can do is torture me. Can you understand? You think I can't understand, is that it? No, it's not that I've decided to give myself up I think you're wrong. I don't see any necessity Yet it's the only solution If I didn't do it, it would only be out of cowardice I couldn't bear being that much of a coward How does cowardice come into it? You're imagining things and can't sleep because you're overwrought It's ridiculous It's something between me and myself I'll only find peace when I'm cuffed I know it now I want to do what is right, nothing else matters I agree about doing what's right Would giving yourself up be right for me and the children? I've thought about that The children's lives can't be ruined... ...because their father does what is right... - Whatever the cost - What about your mother? Justice doesn't spare a guilty man because his family will suffer You're completely obsessed I can see it in your eyes I know why. It has nothing to do with what's right or wrong It's a morbid desire to hurt yourself You take pleasure in torturing yourself Giving yourself up has no moral value It will be perversion, nothing else What about my crime? That's perversion? Do you think I murdered Laura out of perversion? You think I strangled her to torture myself? - You're not a criminal - I am, I killed her I'll tell them it was premeditated, that I wanted her dead - That's exactly it - You know it's not true You know that's not true It is. I know it now Now, I know You're trying to destroy yourself. You're behaving like a madman You may be right. I may be going mad Get hold of yourself. That's real courage It's not in giving up and sentencing yourself I believe in you. I know you're fundamentally innocent You have to believe it too You have to be happy again. We can be - You think so? - Yes All these ghosts must vanish - Fran?ois said that too - It's true Fight for our happiness Come now Let's go back to bed and try to sleep - Talk to me about Laura's death - Stop thinking about it Talk to me about it if you want me to stop thinking about it I think you got rid of something you couldn't bear any longer I'm not sure you killed her Since you told me everything, I can't believe you really did it My darling... It's terrible but I won't be able to live with it I know I won't. It's pointless to fight Cowardice or madness, I can't go on I'm through. I'll give myself up in the morning. Listen to me... I put my papers in order and I wrote a letter to my mother I'll mail it before giving myself up No, you can't do that I don't want to influence you, but... ...wait a little longer Not tomorrow. It's all I ask I am not being impulsive. I thought it over I could have done it at the police this morning I just didn't want to do it without telling you Spending another day with you and the children is unbearable Please don't ask me to It's the only way you can help me I want to have your consent I'd like to do it in full understanding with you... ...the children... ...and my mother Yes, you're right I won't say any more - Really? - Yes I could have committed suicide. It would have been better for all But I would've been a coward. A coward... I can't despise myself that much. Forgive me I understand I admire you... More than anyone else in my life I feel close to you. You're wonderful Give me something to sleep Make night fall My dear H?l?ne, I'm writing to you now... ...because I believe it will help you I know you'll read between the lines the things we'll never talk about The terrible pain I felt when Charles took his life... ...gave me but a small idea of your sorrow But the pain is being replaced now... ...by the image of the wonderful man he was As you know... ...all his life, he fought for the happiness of those he loved He couldn't live without dignity His weaknesses made him more lovable... ...so close to you, so very close May God have pity on us. Fran?ois - What is it? - A letter from Fran?ois - About Charles? - Yes, about Charles The children are beginning to forget The garden and house of Charles and H?l?ne... ...was designed and created by architect, Jack Hamoniau
