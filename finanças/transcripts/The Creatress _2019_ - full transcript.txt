- So, Ms. Bellow-- - No relation. That was my first question, beat me to it. Big reading you have ahead of yourself - at Book Smart Downtown later today? Yeah, that is the sentence. Well, I don't think it'll be that bad. Book readings aren't known to end with the audience eating the author. Oh, but I do like that visual. Someone trying to appease a room full of cannibals with chick lit. I mean, I can't say that's the best category or the strongest genre to tackle - that sort of room, but... - Well, if not chick lit, what genre do you consider yourself? I don't know, I guess I don't like to be tied down. Categories are for agents and bookstores as a shortcut when your job is selling books all day long. You know, readers alphabeticalize. We look at books differently. They influence and authors end up pigeonholed. I mean the moral of the story is the good life is reserved for the readers. Explore the store, have fun, be curious. Uh huh, so is irony your favorite? Well, the madness is, in today's world, no one can know anymore. - Seriously? - Well, what you say-- It sounds like you're having a meltdown. If you let them think you're crazy, they're going to think that I'm crazy. And if I'm crazy, I can't help you. I can't even help me myself and we both lose. Whoa! What the-- What was that about? Well, that sounds like work. It's less work than social media. I mean, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, those are work. But if people scroll and scroll all day long, I mean even when they're in movies that they paid to see or with people that they love, it's like get off your phones! If we had a way to track how many words people read on average today, I bet you it's more than War and Peace cover to cover worth of scrolling every year. Which, you know, when you think about it, it's actually really impressive. You hand someone a 1,000 or a 1,300-page book, tell them to take a year, for some reason, they get scared. It only works out to about five pages a day, by the way. But people read 280 characters at a time. Well, no, read one sentence at a time. So I said to him post-postmodernism is so over. Come on, tricks are for kids. Can you write something truthful for God sakes? Also, and I'm going to have to use some pictures from you. I got to give something to the publisher. Nobody's writing blank million dollar checks anymore. Oh, I'm sorry, do you mind? No, not at all. I'm just going to be down there. Okay, okay. Carrie here. No, you listen to me first! My client said he hates fucking three of them, his words! Well, did your stupid artist even read what the title of the book is? No, no, no, no, he's done this before to me! When I see him, I'm going to personally strangle him. Oh, so I'll strangle his attorney, too. Oh, that's a fun one. Written in high school, published years later. Pretty pure stuff. They went no picture. And it didn't matter, still did well. Better when that happens. Did you like it? It's an authentic debut. We'll see when the next one shows up here. They all do. You make this place sound like it's a pound. Well, some do tend to get adopted quicker than others. Thank you. I don't like that cover. It's all wrong! Why? Because it appears as if you're trying to overcompensate for the sentences and the book - deserves better than that. Hey, listen I usually only check voicemail twice a day when taking a dump on a good day. If you think I'm an animal, you're the one still leaving me voicemail, text. Hey, you know what? I think we got a bestseller! Well, they haven't read it yet and half of them haven't even bought it yet, so. All right, so can you please be in the moment and appreciate how special this all is? Just try and put on your happy face. - Turn the frown upside down. - Mm-hmm. And, also, do not talk anyone out of buying the book. - I know, I know. - Thank you, thank you. Hi, there. Actually super disappointed this mic doesn't have any feedback on it. Going to have to break the ice myself now. So, guess this is what an AA meeting feels like. I'm Eryn Bellow. I've been in sentence construction for over a decade now. I hope this adds something. - Hey, I really love what you wrote. - Oh, thanks. But do you get some kind of thrill out of trying to hurt us with the story? Um... I'm asking out here because I figured you wouldn't want me - to ask in there with everyone. - Right. Well, it's not being done at you. I guess, I thought we were just trying to work on something together. Eryn, come on, come on! If you don't like it, you can walk away, right? But thank you for coming. Thank you. Sweetie, just wanted to tell you, you were great, great today! No, no, no, I just, I thought were you coming. Oh, no, you know, I have this such a boring dinner with my boss and the three amigos. You can come, welcome to join. No, I'm good. Smart you. - Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - Tired, long day. Yeah, tell me about it. How'd it go? - It was good. - Yeah, what'd you read? Same old. Good old Misnomer, the rant about words bouncing off their target. Yeah, at least when code doesn't work, I get instant feedback when the app crashes. God, that sounds so good. I get it down and then I've got to wait ten years to see if it mattered. Not if you win a Pulitzer. Right, name the last five winners. Anyway, listen. There's a reason that I wanted to video chat with you. Oh, yeah? Well, look what I was just eyeing. Keli Onherback romp is not Kosher, yowza! Oh, all right, yeah. I don't know if, uh, hey, I don't know if that's funny or offensive. Anyways. Yeah, anyway. I, seriously, I want you to say hi to Lacey. - What? - Now, hear me out. Hear me out. - What is, what is she doing there? - She showed up here. I told her right away that I was completely uncomfortable with it. - Yeah, yeah, me, too. - See, the thing is that's why I was putting this all out in the open because I don't want you to think that I'm hiding anything because there's nothing to hide here. Wait, so why are you saying all that like that? Because she showed up. She wanted to talk. - About? - Not about that. About moving, missing us. About how we made a mistake? Maybe. Why didn't you answer when I called earlier? Because we were talking. Right, I want to talk to her. - Yeah, good. That's why I wanted to video chat with you because that way you can just go ahead and say whatever, say whatever, say whatever you want to say. Here. Hi, Eryn. Hi. - You okay? - Yeah. No, yeah, I'm good. It's just, it's been rough. Yeah, are you drinking a beer? - Yeah. - So, what you just popped by? I don't think I'm going to be here when you get back. Right, well, I have a meeting tomorrow, but I should be back in a day or two. No, well, with the way they've been flying you around. Look, you're moving, Lacey. No one's dying. Yeah, I know. I'm just, I don't know. Anyway, I got to head out. Okay, let me call you back? Wait, what, why? Well, what, you want me to put you on the windowsill, so you can watch her out? Fine, call me back. Okay. Shit! Hello? I'll be down in a minute. Oh, God. So just tell him to go fuck himself. And then when he realizes I don't like fucking myself, I want you to do it for me, then, you will get Theo back. Do it! - This is all day. - God. Okay. All right. What is this? Oh, it's a hangover cure. The best, the best. Hi, there, the usual. - Here. - I just need a macchiato. No, no, this is much better. It's a plant-based straw, and I'll take the usual, too. I don't know, should I be worried? I mean, is this some kind of a drinking problem? Nnn nnn. - Hi, good morning. - Yes, hi. Yes, I'm here with Eryn. Uh... Yes, I have you here, Mrs? Yes, yes. Mrs. Yes, right. Mr. Williams is telling me that we need to wait until Ms. Freeman is ready. Oh, how long is that going to be? She's usually 10 minutes behind. You know what? That is actually probably going to be better for us 'cause I, it's like a literal ball and chain. Shame, shame! Are you going to be okay for this meeting? Please don't yell at me. Hey, Carrie, we're ready. Doubtful. Hi, Eryn, I'm Gregg. Okay. So, Eryn, congratulations on your novel. I love where it took me. Such a departure from your debut. And I want to thank you both for coming here and making time for us because I know that you're at the end of your trip. And, a little birdie told me that you had been taking other production meetings thus far, so I know that you have choices, options. I also heard something about a series? Yes, well, that's why we're interested in hearing what you all have to say because I'm interested in getting on with lunch. Lunch? Oh, well, who are you lunching with? With Eryn. Ah! - Probably not eating. - 86 it. We're thinking of Cruise for the lead. But the antagonist is 25. I happen to know Tom Cruise very well and I think if he wants to do it, - we can age him down. - Hmm, so it wouldn't be the character that changes. It would be the actor. Having him play 25 again would be a great press move and I think it would up the value of the project to twofold if not more. Mmm hmm, mmm hmm. Wait, who's that? It's me! Hey! Down, sit down! You wanted me to give her the risky business, right? - Did we offend her? - No, no, no. She's just a little under the weather. But I'm sure that she'll feel much better if you can get your offer into the mid-sixes. So, I'll be off. Good day. - Fire that little brat! - You're fired. This is so good. - How do you know? - How do I know? That bottle cost a hundred bucks, that's how I know. Mmm, oh! Now, they told me that you opted out for tomorrow's meeting because you want to take the red-eye home? Yeah, I feel like you don't need my help picking who's going to fuck it up the least. Well, you got that right. I got stuff I got to get home to. - Writing? - Maybe. Come on now, you know, I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but there is a deadline on the horizon - and I know I don't need to remind you. - Yeah, no, I know, I know. I just, I've got some ideas that I'm noodling. Oh, good, good! - Good, good, good, what? - Yeah. I'm still working on them, so I don't want to-- - Thank you. - Thank you. You can tell me, friend to friend. Okay, so I'm thinking it's a sci-fi set in the '90s with rap music. - Oh, no. - What? - No, no, no. - No, why? No, because historical sci-fi doesn't work unless you happen to be steampunk. Wait, so we call this gangster-steam. Nobody reads steampunk except for the few people that read steampunk. Okay. No, it's not okay. The publisher offered you mid-six figures advance. That tells you that they want a lot of people to read your books, not just those people. What do you mean those people? What do you mean, what do you mean? You know what I mean. It's such a small demographic. It's a niche demographic. - That's a thing! - Niche, shmiche. Okay, it's a road trip story. Two best friends are going to Argentina, except they can't go to the next country until they have sex with someone in the country that they're in. It's Country Country, Bang Bang! Oh, I don't know. Come up with something else. That doesn't singe me like that dress. Sibling rivalry drama, brother and sister. They're both in love with the same girl. Believe it or not, I heard a very similar pitch last week. - What? - Same snatch, different day. How about this? A coalition of religious leaders discovers the cure to cancer which reinstores value in modern faith only to reveal the science behind the coalition. I got Tiger Portal to move up, so you should stay 'til tomorrow. - What, you didn't like those guys today? - We could get more. Well, what about a remake? That goes fast and then you won't get writer's block. Yeah, especially if I'm plagiarizing. No, we wouldn't do it like that. I just want something that's quick. Something honest, something truthful. Well, I need to have something that I feel like is worth the paper. It's not being printed. - It's on digital. - Oh, my God! It's like an old-fashioned detective story, but the detective is an amnesiac and the criminal has a photographic memory. You know, there is a Swedish fairy tale that I've always loved, The Prince Without a Shadow. We want something that people actually know. People know fairy tales. Not Swedish ones, honey, not even the Swedes. The poster had nothing to do with the story. Well, at least they knew chartreuse was green. The Salem witch trials, but set in modern day. Why don't you do a memoir? - That's a good idea. - What, no! 'Cause then you could write about what you know. I'm not even 30, that's stupid. And they want to sell it in the US. Nobody here is going to want a fairy tale that doesn't have a happy ending. You can thank Disney for that. What about a bunch of girls, all tweens-- No, I hate it. I haven't even heard it and I hate it. Well, that's all I had. I thought you'd come up with the rest. - A remake is a chance to set the record straight. - Pass. - Why? - Because it's not what they want. - Well, what do they want? - They want something that they already like. - Oh, my... - You don't want to wait until somebody salacious comes along and writes his own version of it. And you know that they will, and they always make money at it. There's used bookstores just filled with whole sections of that crap. - Memoir, it's terrifying no matter who writes it. - Thank you. - Here's your macchiato. - It's probably better it's not me. I'm always struck by that responsibility that the writer has because they have such power and, as we know, with great power - comes great responsibility. - Yes, indeed. You have the power to determine the fates of everyone in this world that you've created. It is the power that we all lack in our own universe, but the writer completely controls in his universe. Ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the cabin for landing. Please place your seats and tray tables in the upright position and we'll be on the ground shortly. Thank you for flying with us and have a nice day. ¶ So good how you call my shit The blue chip ¶ ¶ Tell me what you want You want to tap it like that ¶ ¶ You want To smack it like that ¶ ¶ Bitch don't worry This right here is durable ¶ ¶ Stay energized And I go on and on ¶ ¶ Turn on the genuine ¶ Oh, you look so good. Thank you, so do you. Wow, it's been a while. Yeah. Thank you. It certainly feels like it. - So.. - So? - Are they going to adapt it? - Um... I don't know, I guess I'd prefer that they didn't. Oh, come on, what about the fatty check that'll pay off the new house before escrow closes? Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to go through with that. I thought you said your bungalow wasn't big enough for the two of you? Are you guys breaking up? Are-- Did you guys sleep together the other night? No. No, I just wanted to say goodbye in person. I didn't know I'm not allowed over unless you're home now. - It's not that. - You know what? Maybe you were right. Sleeping together was a mistake. Yeah, I just thought maybe they'll get it out of their system while I'm around. And now I'm moving. So what? So you won't have to worry. Rand. Ow. Rand! Okay, ow, no! Okay, okay. Damn it! Okay, okay. Rand? Rand? Oh, Jesus. Ow. So you're seriously you're not going to believe me? Eryn, we didn't do anything. I just need you to help me pack my stuff in the morning. I mean, could you at least go sleep on the bed? No, I can't. Well, now you don't have to get rid of this place. I always gonna miss it. I don't know how you could be so illogical! Well, that's why you write code and I write prose. I hope that in time you realize I was telling you the truth. The way you remember it or the way it actually happened? Through, straighten the back leg. Very slowly press down to the left leg. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No. No! No! Inhale with the right leg parallel to the Earth. Then you go through the right foot through the palms. Stay-- - You're kidding me. - I'm hardly a kidder. I'm earnest. That's probably not the right word. Um, fine, I will take one of these. We're closed. Ring it up in the morning. - That bag is $24. - What? Never hire that asshole actor. Whoop. Okay. Carry on. Get back. Print the pages, print the pages. Where's the rest? Oh, God. I have Eryn on two. She can't wait to talk to you. I'll go get your Xanax. - Hey. - So? There's nine pages. - Yeah. - That's it? I just wanted you to get an idea of what track I was on. - So, there's no more? - No. - Okay, good. - Just good? No, the pages suck, honey. Well, I thought you wanted me to write a memoir? It's so depressing. Thank you. Sorry. I mean, it's a little bit embellished. Look, you can't purposely set out to write a fake memoir. Well, at least I'm being upfront about it. It's like I dare you to find the truth in it. Okay, you know what, forget the memoir. I'll get a biographer. You'll have full approval, - and profit participation. - What? Sweetie, you got to get used to the idea that you're a public figure. - You're a brand, people know you. - Are you telling me the only thing you don't want me to write about is me? Yes. No fake memoirs. No Nordic fairy tales. No gangster-punk. Something else, fast! The publishers are waiting for pages. And if they don't get them soon, they're going to sit their asses down and write you a letter in the language that they love most, legalese. Think about it. Bye. Welcome, welcome to the autumnal edition of BookWorm. I'm your host, Will Foresight. I'll be sharing these five or so megabytes with the critic for Califoreigner Monthly, Theo Mencken. - Theo, welcome. - Thanks for-- It's open. Oh, in paperback. Your very own. - Oh. - Hi, Nana. Oh, I still like this one best. Doesn't give you a clue what's on the inside, which makes me curious. That's why I love you. We'll be discussing a number of topics today including readership going up, the return of long form. But first, something we were discussing before we started recording and I said, Theo, hold on. This is good stuff. Save it for the podcast. Are you seeing anyone? - Nana. - You should be. - Well, so should you. - I am. And if you were around more, you'd know that. It's much better for me to talk about my great grandkids than it is to listen to somebody else talk about their uncle. Nana. You need to visit more. I have, like, zero time. You make of time what you want. And if you don't make time, young lady, I'm going to tell this journalist, or whoever, that you were selling drugs in high school. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. So, a few minutes ago, you were espousing on a new theory on young adult readers? Yes. Who are they, these young adults? It's code for easy. Adults get to feel young again and the young get a taste of the sourness that awaits them as adults. It's easy, moves fast, and no big words. Well, I got news for you, pizza can be great, - but they don't award Michelin stars to pizzerias. - No. Simply because it will never be the greatest meal in the world. And what about Eryn Bellow? Well, who gives a shit? Wait, why? Well, she's inauthentic. She's trying to decode and decipher our world from the position of a quarter-life crisis. That her publishers sell her on her last name where like she's in the category of O'Conner, or a little Rand. Well, pardon me, but I'm not buying. Why? Well, she's about as erudite as my five-year-old showing off her new dive, but unlike my child, she doesn't belly flop. She misses the goddamn pool. And the concrete is hard especially from those heights. What are you looking at me like that for? What, what-- - That doesn't seem fair. - What's the worst that's going to happen to her, a concussion? She'll live, hopefully with enough amnesia to forget writing. It's a bit early, don't you think? Well, hello to you, too. It's earlier here. I'm allowed to be cranky. Are you okay? Yeah, no, there's a really nice soft bush outside the window of my one-story balcony. I don't own any rope, and I don't cook enough to keep my knives sharp, so-- All right, listen, you got to go - to Los Angeles right away. - Why? - Because I booked you on Perspective. - Why? Because I want you to shut those critics up and I want you to set it straight and tell everybody your story. Now, you'll be flying on my expense account. While you're at it, my husband never shuts up about this Korean-Persian restaurant. I said it's Asian fusion. It's not the of course, but I'm dying to have you try-- Fine. ¶ Money that pop in that boy ¶ ¶ Go ahead and gag ¶ ¶ My kicks are flawless I live by my rules ¶ ¶ No doubt I am lawless Don't matter them haters ¶ ¶ Them chicks is just mad You bitches washed up ¶ Just like Trinidad But we want to party ¶ ¶ Their chicks at my brother's Is me and my woes ¶ ¶ Sexy is this Thick as a bitch ¶ ¶ Smart as a what? Sexy as fuck So we make it hot ¶ ¶ For these chicks to keep up ¶ ¶ Buzz it's time ¶ ¶ For you to step up ¶ ¶ Walk up then Make like she love me ¶ ¶ But like oh, my ¶ ¶ Flies, hell ¶ Can you help set the table? Dinner's ready. Of course. You should go. Trips always shake things up. Good for Ulysses. People, five minutes. You can do me up. Keep going, don't be scared of me. It's Vivian Mosswood. Oh, she's my favorite designer, British. Oh, on set. Hey, Jessica. You look amazing. Oh, it's so good to see you. Good to see you, too. - You know, I loved Misnomer. - Oh. Incredible length. How did you get all that in there? Thank you so much. That means the world to be coming from you. I tore through Trophy Life. I mean, I finished it in the middle of the night. Caffeine did not even cross my mind once. Oh, my God. The faster you turn them, the happier they are. You know, I just get afraid for when the page scrolling metrics start shoving up, - tracking how fast people scroll. - Right? They'll throw that back in our faces. So-and-so gets them to read them at 400 words per minute. Yeah, so no big words. And just a list of actions. I mean, I, for one, would love it if you did some sort of, like, cool, mass market paperback. I do love it when a book can fit into my back pocket. Right, I love that. So good to see you. So good to see you, too. Thank you so much for coming on the show. We never thought we could get you on. Pleasure to meet you in person. Put a face to the page proofs. Oh, I never realize you you covered that genre. I've been doing literary for years. All right, shall we all be seated, yes? What famous singer is on... She was so pleasant, pleasant. Please hurry, please, please hurry. And three, two, one. Good evening and welcome to The Writer Perspective. I'm your host, Gwen Ginsberg. - I can't keep-- - Excuse me, Carrie, clients are on. All right. Can you please do something? Joining me on the stage, Jessica Morrison. Most famous for Writes A Wrong, but most recently, Trophy Life. And then-- And author and screenwriter of Everyone Loves Buffoons, Theo Mencken. And of course, we are very lucky and grateful to have her, a very rare public appearance, Eryn Bellow who is going to get my first question. Why Chartreuse? Still can't hear them. Oops, shh. Well, it is a pale green French liqueur made from 150 herbs. It's like wheatgrass alcohol. Well, not what is it scientifically, but it's been over a year and no one can agree on the title. - It's up to the reader. - Oh. Like it's the first... Oh, look at her! Oh, isn't she beautiful! Oh, oh, and look at those legs, she looks terrific. - She looks good, right? - She does. - No, she looks-- - Yes. That's my stylist. I mean, when I remember endings, I usually don't remember the rest of the novel. And to me a novel is a journey, it's not a result. And so if a book doesn't end, but fades out, I don't know, it makes the stuff in the middle more important. Risky. - So far so good. - Yeah, look how - composed she is. - Yeah. So, Ms. Queen of Suspense and Book Club Fiction. - Hate that. - What, book clubs? No, sorry, I love that people are reading it, it's just when it's categorized like that, I mean, you don't need a support group to read it. You just read it. Yeah, I mean, it's not like it even paints it in a certain light. It's like more like-- - Like a shadow? - Yeah. And misconceptions, they stick on books, color our judgment. This is the future of picture watching? Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins? And Ann Welty. Oh! The most graphic of them all. She's just punchy. She has my heart. Theo, funny feeling, she's not yours. Oh, no. I can appreciate Welty. She ogles the rich and famous like Collins, but with more artistic punch. All are straightforward. Welty offers more. She's more spirituelle. Are you trying to be nice? Big ideas don't come from big words. Well, while you're off playing word chess, - you lose your audience. - What audience? Well, maybe if Ann Welty lived a little off the page, to me she's too much wonderment of the banal. But what about John Updike? Couldn't the same be said of him? You love him. Of course. He was risqué. - Aye. - Perhaps you could talk about adaptation. These ladies are going down that road for the first time. It's good for business, but don't bother writing the script. Leave that to the wolves. Books are different than movies and both are different than real life. Listen, a bit on words. I know populism is in these days, appeal to the ruralites, but words are important. They must be handled with care. Ideas are viruses that can infect us all. So, when they are handled recklessly, and gain an audience, as both these young ladies have been so lucky to have gained, words really mean something. They are paid for their words. They should use them well as they build sentences. And the sentences reach up to form the rafters so meaning can harbor safely in its clasp. This shelter is the church of readers. Did you adapt that from here is the church, here is the steeple? Open the doors then see all the people? You know, bad reviews can ruin careers. - Are you threatening us, Mr. Mencken? - Just you, Mrs. Bellow. - Oh, no. - Oh, God. God, help me. Maybe I shouldn't have done this. So, I think that things don't have to be incomprehensible to be great? No, it doesn't, but it should at least aspire for something. Irving doesn't write until he knows the last sentence. Well, that's great, for him. But, we're all different souls and assuming that's where we write from, it ought to be different. And distilling 10,000 hours into a couple hundred pages. I mean, you can't hide from yourself when you're alone - writing for months and months. - Or years. Yeah, and then, a reader takes it down in a couple weeks. Or a day. So the publishers hope. Better to have that bar lower, and move on so as not to reveal there is nothing to your superficial marriageableness. You say the word soul, yet your sentences go nowhere because they aspire for so little. And yes, I'm calling you out. I heart colloquialisms. Yeah, well, it's easy to throw stones. True. Not easy to crack that glass. Now that's just mean. That's just mean. Well, why don't you show us how? Right now, with all the cameras rolling? And on that note, we'll be right back. Hide the razor blades, I'm going to kill myself. His clean collar contrasted his light amber scruff, spotless shoes, worn belt holes showing a recent attention to fitness, well-tied tie, perfectly upturned cuff. All in all, a well-put together man. Excuse me. Are you good at algebra? Think you could replace my X without asking Y? I'm sorry, that sounded so much better when I read it. Hi, I'm Brad. Nice to meet you. I don't have a pickup as cheesy as that. Checkmate. Excuse me. Nice try. Get back in line. - She's... - Nina. ...with me, now. If this is what she gives up for coffee, imagine what she gives up to get into a club. BRB. The tingle bounced off the inside of her fingertips. Inbound signals conflict with outbound, shaking her hands, forcing her to hold them steady with her legs. Immediately, the electric moment began to dissipate. So she spreads her legs, digs her claws in, grabbing ahold to savor the moment. For love at first sight is a rare, endangered energy. So, is this your coffee shop? You mean, do I come here often? Yes, I'm afraid so. And we're past the icebreaker. Yeah, I realize how that sounded. I just so badly wanted to say the right thing, and in the process of throwing out all the wrong things, you know, don't say that, not that one, definitely not that, I guess that one sort of got overlooked. I'm sorry. Not sorry. Do you think love at first sight is endangered? - This is me. - Oh. - Where are you parked? - Um, oh, I walked. - Oh, cool. - I'm looking forward to dinner tonight. Yeah. - Seven? - Seven. - Great. - Oh. Sorry, I'm keeping you. Oh, big day, already. - Bye. - Bye. The garishly bejeweled dress reeked of a woman divorced of money trouble. She felt set free beneath the weight, and, at least for now, stood tall, allowing her financial freedom to shine. Is there something in particular I can help you find? How did you know to ask me that? It's my job. You know I do have a business line. Um, I'm just taking a quick break but I wanted to call and tell you - that I am working on something. - Oh, great. Don't worry. It's something everyone knows. I'm looking for the truth in tropes. I'm sure the publisher will be thrilled! The definition of his hard abs was as angular as the corners on his cherry red super car. He shyly explained how it was cobbled together for three generations by a family of mechanics in the Italian Alps. He questions the aerodynamics while grabbing ahold of the stick and shifting gears, casually wondering how much sex the hood could withstand. Vroom-- Do you live alone? I do. Huh. So, I'm just realizing this now, and it's kind of amazing, but it never came up this morning. What do you do for a living? I am in construction. What? I'm an architect, journeywoman. - Oh, wow. - I don't know about wow. The ferocity of their fight allowed all the oldies but goodies to seep out in their nastiest forms. Lack of communication was, "you don't fucking talk to me about shit anymore." Turning the kids into comrades against the other came out as, "your son is following in your asshole footsteps!" And the familiar, good old taking the other for granted as "I'm just here to cook and drive the kids to school, and screw, and we barely do that!" And this, of course, presented the solution which was to do what they did best. Two thieves steal a calendar. They each get six months. So, how did your last relationship end? To be honest, it's still not over yet. What does that mean? Well, this is all a bit sudden. Well, I'll say. But what does that mean? I've been dating someone, more off than on. Lately, it's been pretty okay. - I'm not one to just walk away from what happened today. - Because you're a cheater. - I wouldn't call what we did today cheating. - Well, you kissed me! You kissed me back, which is a lot different than sleeping together. Oh, there's no sleeping when I sleep with someone. Are you even listening to me? I'm trying. Oh! Freaking ice cold! - Is everything all right? - Yeah. Let me just see if I can bring this one back from the brink. Thanks. Sir, are you guys done? No, no. Yeah, it's just not working out. Pardon me, sorry. Yes, mmm hmm. Oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Mmm, mmm, mmm. Morning. I don't understand these, but this one looks more like you. But why isn't it red? What? The cover. Wait, what color is chartreuse anyway? Uh... Hey, I didn't actually realize the time. I got to get going to work. Oh, wait. You want to get coffee? I'll just have to drive without it. Risky, I know, but it's better than being late. See you soon? Yeah. ¶ Well, she's got your smile When she walks by ¶ ¶ She says, damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ She looks to you Like she could cheer you up ¶ ¶ And you know she could ¶ ¶ She looks my way and says ¶ ¶ You don't Look like you should ¶ ¶ So just come along And sing this song ¶ ¶ Called damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ I tell myself that 24 hours a day Damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ This life's too short To have it any other way ¶ ¶ Everybody should Just take the time ¶ ¶ To make themselves feel good ¶ ¶ Well, just say, good ¶ ¶ Damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ She says you know When I'm so bad ¶ ¶ I'm so bad, damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ Together and maybe you'd be ¶ ¶ But I'm telling you ¶ ¶ Well, damn, I'm good, I tell ¶ The stalker paced behind, step for step, bonded in their precise distance, not far, not close. She, the prey, tests their bond, slow steps then quick. The stalker kept in step, holding true to their conflicted connection. She panics. Her panic brings him pleasure. He forbids her escape. This was him pawing at his prey, toying, toying, fantasizing about her flailing realization that she was powerless here, in public. All right. Hey, careful with that ball. All right, bye. Okay. Bye, guys. ¶ Damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ Oh, yeah ¶ ¶ There are days When we don't feel ¶ ¶ Just like we should ¶ ¶ That's the most important time to say ¶ ¶ I feel good, damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ I tell myself that 24 hours a day ¶ ¶ Damn, I'm good, This life's too short ¶ ¶ To have it any other way ¶ ¶ Everybody should Just take the time ¶ ¶ To make themselves feel good ¶ ¶ Well, just say good ¶ ¶ Damn, I'm good ¶ ¶ Everybody say, good ¶ ¶ Damn, you're good Everybody now ¶ ¶ Everybody say good ¶ ¶ Damn, I'm good ¶ Go. Again. Again. - I got this part. - Yeah. And you want to make it faster. Yeah, all right. - You get it? Now then. Go, go. - All right. Hey. What's this all about? Huh? You got nothin' on me. How can you be so sure? Who are you? Huh? Wait, don't come another step closer. I have a-- Mmm. Stop! Oh, babe, I don't need a rape fantasy on top of a stalker fantasy. How'd you know it was me? Why would anyone investigate me? Oh, Mr. Innocent, huh? I'm not an angel. He had a condom in his wallet/arm band thing. It all happened so quick. So meanwhile were you getting good stuff? Yeah. So, go, have fun, be safe and bring me pages, would you? Yeah, so all of sudden this feels so real. I can't do this. Do what? I am in a relationship. Ha! So, both of us? It's kind of a relief, in a way. I mean, hey, it's messed up and, I'll be honest, and I hope you take this the right way, I didn't feel bad, like remorseful, even, but we're never meant to be together, me and her. So, do you not feel the same way? It's with my cousin. Your cousin? My cousin's brother. So, your cousin? Yeah, no, no. I don't know. - What, is it the half-brother? - Who, what? To the cousin that you're in this relationship with. Isn't that what we're talking about here? So, you're not bothered by this? You're just trying to figure it out? Like family tree? - Oh. - What? Oh. Is this incest fetish? Wow, you are something else. Oh, my God. I can't. I'm sorry. Your jacket! You're going to catch a cold! So what are you saying? You broke up with him? I was crawling into bed with someone who was willing to entertain an incest fetish. Do you have no concern for my well-being? Oh, sweetie, guys are into much weirder stuff than that. I just read about a micro trend that they're doing it with dolphins, believe it or not. You are no help. Your problem is you need to have a lot more experience with guys. Why don't you go on the Tinder Goodbye. - Bye. - I'll poke you. So, um, where did you, where did you grow up? What are you doing? Oh. So. Oh, my God, are you... I'm sorry. - It's hard for me. - Here. Oh, um... I can't, it's just... - You're a writer? - I mean, everyone's a writer, technically. I guess, I mean... I text a lot. - I mean, it's not entirely the same thing. - No not. Tell me about you. What do you do? Um, you know I like to think of myself as more than just an accountant. I live a very full life on the weekends. Things beyond the numbers, things beyond numbers. Oh, wow. It's amazing. Um, would you like to go out again sometime? Oh, my goodness. Look at you. You, yes, I would love to, actually. Gimme your number. All right, there you go. I really always wanted to try this, for real. Oh, yeah, but cash is dirty. Ones are the worst. Oh. Touched the most hands. You really thought of that? Ah. Yeah, one second. - Hi. Is this your dog? - Yes. - Ho-- - Thank you so much. - Oh! - Buckles. - Buckles? - Buckles. Yeah, wait, wait I got a treat. I got a treat, I got a treat. Yes. Oh, thank you so much. - Look, I don't know how I can repay you. - You're welcome. But can I take you out? Do you want to maybe come in? I would love a glass of water. That's a heavy dog. Cool. And maybe we could like have sex or something? - Maybe some-- - How about a glass of water? Yeah. Come on. I mean, it was great day. Buckles, thank you, awesome. - You are so welcome. - Yeah, fantastic. How's that avocado? Um, it's good, I love it. - That's good. Those are good fats. - Thank you, yeah. I like guacamole, so. - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. I'm big on the guac. - Yeah. - Oh. - Had a good workout today. Great. Yeah. Big WAD. Big what? - WAD. - Big WAD? - Yeah. - Oh. Workout of the day. - Oh, workout of the day? - Yeah. I don't think I've heard that before. Yeah, and hit some PRs. What's that? Personal records. - Nice. - And PBs, PBs. - PBs? I get it now. I get that. - Personal best. - Personal best? Yeah, my personal best. I've always against myself, competition against myself, like-- I like that you take care of yourself. That's-- Hey, without your health, you don't have anything. - Yeah. - So, yeah. Health, my dog and, you know, a lady. Good night. Listen, I can't thank you enough. Is this the part where I say you can thank me in bed? I mean, yeah, uh, I won't turn you down. But that's something that could wait till the second date if you want. Thanks for saving Buckles. It's just a weird name. I'm sorry. Listen on second thought, do you want to just-- Good night, Seth. Everyone, turn 'em over. All right. And down the rows, to the left. I'll take those. Thank you. Good. You guys are good to go to lunch. - Have a good day, guys. - Good, bye, bye. All right, don't forget to do your homework, all right? Okay? Fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit. - Hi. - Oh, hey, what's up? - Hi. - Good to see you. - You, too. You look great. - Thanks. Do you mind if I sit here? Um, yeah, sure. No problem. Want to keep my back to the door, so I could just focus on you. Nice. Ah, I got shots for us. Great. - Um-- - Gains. - So, did you work out today? - Ooh ah. Just got it in. I'm still buzzing. - Right. - Every workout, - making through. - Yeah, nice. - Yeah, I hit a major PR today. - Um-- - Personal record. - Right. - Yeah, rowing. - You told me that. 2000 miles in under four minutes. - I mean, like, I'm bulging. - Eryn] Yeah. Did you know that when you're working out you're actually tearing muscle fibers like a zipper? You have the myosin and the actin, so like you're tearing them apart - and then you rebuild them. Science. - So, that is science. I guess you're sort of a scientist. Yeah, you know, by proxy, I think so. Yeah. What does your diet say about shots? - Going into a cheat day, so I say, bring it on. - Great. Bartender, could we get two more each. Whoa! For a little girl, you can really drink. - So, what else do you do when you're not working-- - HIIT. - HIIT? - Uh, high intensity interval training. Cardio. - Oh. - Yeah. I'm really looking to get ripped right now, so that keeps your metabolism up, gets you shredded. - Thank you. - Thank you. So basically, my metabolism, off the chain right now. I'm burning calories when I'm out of the gym. Caloric burn. So, do you ever do yoga or-- Yeah, I think you, as much as you build up the muscle, - you got to stretch it. - What the hell is this? - Oh, who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? How about that last shot? Oh, my gosh. Gains. Look, I know we got into some weird stuff, but this is batshit crazy. Oh, eh, don't talk to the lady like that. Dude, I bet you don't even have a clue. Did she tell you what she did with her cousin? No, what'd she do with her cousin? Okay, I think it's time to go you and your little incest story. I mean, she clearly moved on and I think you should leave. Yeah, have fun with this guy. Oh, oh, excuse me, oh, is this for me? Thank you so much. Buckles, sit, sit. Hey, you, come here. Hey. - Hey. - Hi. I brought you a hangover cure and a protein shake, in case you've already worked out which knowing you... Thanks. I'll make sure not to venture too far from the toilet. Smart. Look, I also wanted to apologize. Don't worry about it. Listen, it's fine. All's well that doesn't end in death. I like that. Listen, I got to get ready for the gym, unless you want to, uh? - Fuck? - Yeah. No, Seth. Buckles, come on. Let's go. Starting here. This one, this one, this one, this one. - Who is next one, two, eight, eight. - Oh, my God, are you okay? Hey, what? What are you doing here? No, I just, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - Hey, hey, go to class. - Oh. I told the kids I had eye surgery. Third grade and bar brawls don't go together. Okay, I also, I wanted to confess. Yeah, I don't read that crap. I wanted to say that I'm sorry. Sorry about what? You deserve better than me and my gimmicks, Brad. You should leave. Yeah. Oh, just a phase? You can call it that. And, phases come and go, Sometimes with the season, huh? Yet, Nina was relieved. She was robbed of nothing. Instead, he had set her free. It was never going to be a clean break. At least, the licking flames looked beautiful as the curtains fell just prior to her third act. End there, before it really gets sad. Um, how much of it is really true? None of it. It's a book. But I did my research. You did a great job. Thank you very much. You did a great job. And now do you think this will be a new category? If it sells more books, sure. Everyone's so busy constructing universes. I'm dabbling in the multiverse. There you go then. - See, that's right. - It's very cool. Uh, any advice for an aspiring writer, Theo? Well, there can be a living in it if you care more about it than any other living writer and just as much as all those who came before. Did you work with Eryn Bellow on it? Uh, you know, if you can't read the cover, you probably shouldn't get the book. Then why didn't she just write her own memoir? Because then it'd have to be true. Don't forget to tell your friends. Spoiler alert, the line of defamation is tested as Mr. Mencken trounces his main character in the end bringing to life Burrough's belief that heroes and heroines are meant to be killed. In this case not before the writer wakes from a coma, only to discover she's lost both her hands, and thus, her will to write. Look, just because it's a sensation doesn't mean we have to go nuts with the second printing. Hey, hey, hey, hey, sorry to intrude. - Oh, oh, hi, Carrie. - Hi. Can you cover this for me? - We may be reissuing it. - Is it any good? I don't know. I have no fucking idea. Ugh. Um, Eryn's in your office. Oh? All right, let me know how that goes. I didn't know you were in New York. Yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Tell me something. You were a lot less likable in the first draft. Fuck you. Come on. I'm in it, too. You didn't lose your hands and the will to write. It's not real, okay? It's not real. Plus, I sent you the pages. I even sent you the ARC to read. You know life goes on for us working people in the real world. You hijacked my life. Those are details you told him. They could've only come from you. All right, I edited the hell out of him. You, I give carte blanche. We couldn't agree on a subject. When did you become his agent? Who do you think got him on that talk show? Listen this, this is nothing but hype. Before you know it, it's going to be collecting dust in those secondhand bookstores that you love so much. Those are an important part of our ecosystem. Okay, fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you or your secondhand bookstore buddies. Why can't you just think of this as a straw man. You're, you're, you're more than welcome to knock it down whenever you want. Can't you just write something even if it has imperfections. They'll say you're going Kerouac. Just gimme a masterpiece for God sakes. Three years, three years past due. You're fired, Carrie. What? Really? Really. How the hell am I'm supposed to work with you? You exploited me. Oh, God, so typical. I've exploited you. I've been freaking breathing life into your wasting career, keeping you on life support. Why can't you just give me something? I can put your career back on track. I can get you freaking published. You're not the only person who can do that for me. Yes, I am, actually. Are you going to give the publishers back their advance money? And how about me? Where's my 10 %? I've been doing my job and quite creatively, I might add. Your mom always listened to me. You're making a mistake. You know every time you look at a memory, it changes just a little bit. Never stays the same. But it can be for the good, like anything else. Right? It can, baby. Hey, you have something for me? I need you to send me the uncorrected proofs. Uh, well, that's a little hard to do before you send it to me. No, Mencken's. Why? Before you cut him back. Why, what are you going to do? Reply, in kind. - Either that or sue your company. - The publisher? For defamation. Although I'm pretty sure, I can prove collusion, too. Just send me the proofs. Okay. Literary revenge, I like it. You see, this is why I told them not to take your advance back yet. I knew you'd get struck by something. They were thinking lightning but I bet book. Sweetie? Sweetie? Hi. And you. Hi, is this your dog? Yes, ah, Buckles. - Thank you so much for finding Buckles. - That is such a cute name. Listen, I don't know how could I repay you? Maybe with some sex? Yeah? To the bed. Bellow. Is that a caramel macchiato? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that's what you ordered. No, I ordered a macchiato. It's just foam and espresso. With caramel. Yeah, but I'm looking for just foam and espresso. - That's it. - No, it's in the name, - caramel macchiato. Oh, wait! Hey! - Wait, stop, stop! - Oh, what the-- - What the? - Shit, open it! Open it! Holy shit. Yeah. Nina? What are you doing? The sensor's broken. Got it. And it's Eryn. Come on. To drink. I'm fine. Whatever, they're cheap. I'm just going to leave it right here in case you change your mind. I can't believe you're not a Nina. I can only see you as a Nina. Don't you think you shouldn't change my name to something better in your version? What's your fancy? Something like Bartholomew. It's a good famous name. No, it is a shit name. You are terrible with names. That's as bad as Buckles. Oh, do you think we should reiterate the fact that you got me drunk which is why I lost that fight? That and we're supposed to see that other guy - as the good guy and I'm the-- - Dick. Now, you are talking. You're taking the words right out of my mouth. Do you think you could like craft up a little passage about, you know, in like Charles Dickens-like detail about the size, and girth, and beauty of my ... But it's unique. Fine. The first thing I'm going to share is slightly different than what you're used to. Come in. Hi. Hi. Do you have a minute? - Nina, uh-- - Eryn. This is my place of work. You can't be here. Yeah, I thought this was a better job for you, okay? Still anything we'd discuss here is probably not going to be appropriate. It's true. - Come on. - Where are we going? Mrs. Ortiz, I'm going to grab a coffee. - I made it. - I need it strong. If I make it any stronger it'll kill you. I can't believe your name's not Nina. I am known by many names. I can't believe you're not really a teacher. Well, in my defense, you never asked. Subbing for a teacher on maternity leave isn't something I bring up on first dates. See, this is why backstories should never be overlooked. That and I don't fancy sympathy lays. You're right. Role-playing should never be depressing. Stalker-rape on the second date is pretty extreme. Yeah, I thought so, too. But, I mean, at least you won the fight, right? Yeah. Do you think they were rooting for me, too? I think that was the design. So where from here? Do you think it's possible for things to get convoluted past the point of no return? You mean, if we have a chance? Yeah, well, like, I mean, I know you're not real but-- I'm not. And yet, here you are. So, whatever. There's no going back. This ship only moves forward. They invented rewind for VCRs. Oh boy, there's something I'm not nostalgic for. Wait. Is there anything that you would change? Let me see it. This is dangerous. Yeah. What if I kidnapped you? More research for your sequel? Stockholm syndrome. Like Bonnie and Clyde but in a steampunk setting with gangsters. I mean, I think we're really getting somewhere here. Let me just tell Ortiz I quit. But in the end, we're from two different worlds. Mine's a more perfect universe. If I can control it, it's not real. Goodbye, Brad. Bye, Eryn. Thank you. So have you found a new place? - I'm really still looking. Yeah. I have a few options that I'm going to decide between. I can show you if you want to help. I could use some, a little bit of help - deciding honestly. Yeah. - I'd love to, yeah. What about like a period love story, like pre-cellphone. There's a lot of places that I can go with that. But that's like, uh, that's what '80s or like 1800s? Or like I do an 1800s thing with cell phones. Like a mashup. - Sci-fi set in the '90s with rap music. - No. And a little birdie told me that you have been meeting other productions and I know you have your pick of who you want to make this book into a film, so... Oh. Oh, that's a fun one. Written in high school, published years later. Pretty pure stuff. It's like two totally different things. - I don't do well-- - Yeah but you like nice things. I like nice things but-- Well, you got to pay for them. - Whoa. - What the-- ¶ Happily ever after ¶ ¶ Is only a story ¶ ¶ I'm ready to find ¶ ¶ My true glory ¶ ¶ We dress up in fancy drawers ¶ ¶ In order to sleep and cope ¶ ¶ Nothing is how we remember ¶ Meanwhile, as soon as this is over, - let's have a drink together. - Let's do that as a possible. ¶ We have one another ¶ ¶ As we write our story ¶ - I do. - I do. ¶ Together ¶ - Hi, can I get you some Chartreuse? - Oh, is that what that is? - Uh-huh. - I wondered why it was green. Yes. Hello to you, you son-of-a-bitch. Hello to you, baby. - Looking good for a shotgun wedding. - Uh, no baby. Honeymoon first. I mean, aren't you the one who accused me of liking perfect order? Or maybe by baby I meant your next book. - Hmm. They are my babies. - I have to say having me here is a bit of a stretch, isn't it? No. I think I can even make you fit into my happy ending. - Hi, you. - Hi. Now you know, I'm not into costumes or characters or theme weddings, and yet here I am. You got to have your way with me, why don't I get to have my way with you? I guess I don't have any choice now, do I? No. You know what I wish you talked to me about more? What, honey? My mother. And my father. Yes, your mama. You know, before she met your dad she was into my Frank. - I know. - She liked him, but he liked me and that made things a little bumpy between me and her, you know, the girlfriend thing. But then she met your father and they fell madly in love. And they made you. It was such a happy time. I will always wonder - if that's the reason. - No. Why you helped me publish. No, no, I told you I love it. And how many times did I say it to you? That I'm the only one that can bring them back. Exactly. You know them so well. Oh, God know that they're up in heaven smiling down on you, so proud. And you know what? Stories never die. So now they're immortalized. Isn't that great how life works? Thank you. Love you, honey. Mmm. Sweet girl. Now be happy. This is a great day. ¶ No need for apology ¶ ¶ Manifesting destiny ¶ ¶ You can get the best in me ¶ ¶ Rewriting my history ¶ ¶ Ya, ya ¶ ¶ Rewriting my history Ya, ya ¶ ¶ Was meant to be, what shall it be ¶ ¶ Ya, ya ¶ ¶ Baby, I'm a fortune for honey They know that I run it ¶ ¶ We move in this work that I done it ¶ ¶ But I don't want to build, now I'm stand ¶ ¶ Gee, your record's good Now, my edge bitch want it ¶ ¶ Girl I run it ¶ I'm sorry.

Some accuser of a concussed state, whatever state it might be, she still felt the work was counterfeit, merely a play in a play, a scattered reflection of real life, iteration, degradation, circuitous routes in the pursuit of happiness.
