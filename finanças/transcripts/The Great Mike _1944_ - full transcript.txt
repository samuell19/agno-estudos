[music playing] Mike! Corky! [dog bark] Come on, Corky. Here, Mike. Nice Mike. Your my boy, aren't you? [patting] Come on, Corky. Your my girl, aren't you? Yeah. Aren't you forgetting something? Speck is a good friend of yours. Don't be jealous, Mike. I love you just as much as I do Corky. And I got a piece of carrot for you. But you're going to have to hunt for it. SPECK: Which hand are you going to put it in? Oh, I don't dare tell you. He understands everything I say. He wouldn't understand if you spell out to him, would he? I don't know. He's pretty smart. Go ahead and try it. OK. It's in my L-E-F-T H-A-N-D. Thatta boy, Mike. I told you he was plenty smart. Gee willikers, I didn't think he knew how to spell. He almost knows everything. [dog barking] What's the matter with her, Jimmy? Oh, she just wants us to see her puppies. Come on. [puppy sounds] Gee, they're sure cute. I'll say they are and smart too. You know, their grandma earned $1,000 a week in vaudeville. $1,000 a week? Gee whiz, what are you going to name them? Well, I already have. [puppy sounds] This one here is, uh, Corky Boy. This one here is-- this one is Corky Queen. This one here is, uh, King Corky. This one is Corkita. Gee, them is sure swell names, Jimmy. I'll say they are. Well, Speck, we got to be getting to work. You take the rest of the horse and the cart down to the shed. I'll go get Mike. OK, Jimmy. Come on, Corky. [music playing] Come on, Corky. Let's go, Mike. Come on. Whoa, Mike. Here you are, boys. Oh, boy, thanks a lot, Mrs. Dolan. Thanks, mom. Such hard working men as you and Speck need lots of food. You're tops mom. Oh, did you sell another pup? Two of them, I think. I took deposits on King Corky and Corkita. Oh, boy, that means I'm $35 closer to owning Mike. Hot diggity dog. Now, you boys be careful when you cross the railroad tracks, won't you? -Yeah, we will. We will, Mrs. Dolan. -All right. Bye, mom. -Bye, boys. -Come on. Go, Mike. Bye. Whoa, Mike. Now, Corky, you stay there with Mike. MR. KENNESON: Oh, Jimmy. Yes, Mr. Kenneson. Here's your new subscription for you. Jay Spencer, 388 Durango Road. Well, that's the old Dalton horse training farm near where I live. That's right. It's been leased to Colonel Whitley, the famous Kentucky race horse breeder. Now, you know who Spencer is, don't you? I'll say. He trains the Colonel's horses. Right. He and the Colonel just arrived with a big string of thoroughbreds for the opening of the new race track being built over at Santa Anita. I suppose you have been over to see the new track. You bet we have. And it sure looks like we're going to have some top notch racing this winter. You bet we will. Hey, Corky, how did you get down here? Jimmy told you to stay up there and watch Mike. That's not Corky. That's my dog, Mickey, Corky's brother. Gee willikers. They look so much alike I can't tell them apart. You're getting dumber every day, Speck. Now you've done it. Oh it wasn't any good anyhow. Nothing we have around here is any good. We ought to buy us a Joe Louis professional punching bag. Yeah, and what are we going to use for money? Now, listen, fellas, if everything goes OK, I'm going to enter Mike in the Santa Anita races. When he wins enough purses, I want to buy what we need for a real, for sure enough clubhouse with gym equipment that ain't busted all the time. We can have shower/bath, and a ping pong table, and weenie roasts. What's the matter with you guys? Don't you believe it? Well, it sounds swell, Jimmy, but well, how do you know Mike is going to win any races? Yeah, how do you know? Well, you just wait and see. Yeah, you guys just wait and see. [buggy] Whoa. You boys looking for someone? Yes, sir, any of you gentlemen Mr. Spencer? I am. I am your news boy, Jimmy Dolan. This is Speck Williams, my assistant. This is Corky, my dog. Glad to know you boys. You too, Corky. Where do you want your paper delivered? In the mailbox or at the house? Just throw it on the porch of the guesthouse here. JIMMY: Yes, sir. You better deliver a paper to me too. You can put it on the porch of the big house. I'm Colonel Whitley. Thanks, Colonel, I know a lot about your racing stables and your Kentucky horse breeding farm. You do? Yes, sir. You bring your handicap champion with you? Yes. How do you happen to know so much about my racing stable? Reading about the sport of kings is one of my hobbies. Would you mind if Speck and me come over once in a while and watch you train your bangtails? Well, I won't mind so long as you keep out of the way. I don't want any kids getting hurt on my property. Thank you, Colonel. Better set your alarm clock, boys. We start working out the horses pretty early in the morning. OK, Corky, deliver that on the front porch. Jeez, Speck, we can come over here tomorrow. It's Saturday. Yeah! We can bring Mike along too. He can learn a lot by just watching the Colonel's horses. You bet he can. You bet he can. Come on, Corky. Thatta girl. Let's go, Mike. JIMMY: Hi, sis. Hi, Jimmy. So that's your kid brother. Yes. But for heaven's sakes, don't let him know you used to be a jockey, or he'll pester the life out of you. OK, Erin. Is that the thoroughbred you were telling me about? The one he's buying from his uncle? Yes. And that subject's taboo too. Or you'll be spending the evening out in the stable. Hello, mom. MRS. DOLAN: Hello, dear. Well, this is home sweet home. It's just like I thought it would be. Mother, I want you to meet Mr. William McKay. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. McKay. And welcome to our home. Thank you, Mrs. Dolan. It's a pleasure to meet you. If you'll excuse me a minute, I want to have a private talk with Jimmy. That's a very good idea, Erin. I'll be right back. All right. Won't you come over and sit down, Mr. McKay. Thank you. He's a good fellow. Now, you get yourself some dinner. Hey, Jimmy, who is Erin's new boyfriend? I don't know anything about him except that he sells insurance. Say, maybe I can sell him one of Corky's puppies. Sure you can. With him messing around Erin. It ought to be a cinch. Hey, Jimmy, it's past 6:00. I got to go home. OK, Speck, see you at 4:00 AM. What's this 4:00 AM business? Gee, sis, I got two new customers. And who do you think they are? Who? Colonel Whitley from Kentucky and his trainer, Mr. Spencer. Well! Speck and me are going over there in the morning and watch him run his horses. Oh, boy, are we going to have fun. At four o'clock in the morning? Sure. Gosh, but you're dumb. Don't you know they work out race horses before breakfast? Well, never mind that. Now, listen, I don't want you to spoil my date thins evening by talking horses. And don't try to show him Mike either. What what can I talk about? Nothing. Mr. McKay is calling on me, not you. Can I just show him Corky's puppies? I was hoping to sell him one. No, not this time. And if you keep your lips buttoned all evening, I'll give you a dollar. It's a deal. Oh, go on. Get cleaned up. And get the stable smell off your hands before you meet Mr. McKay. OK, sis. Jimmy, this is Mr. William McKay. Glad to meet your, Mr. McKay. It goes double, Jimmy, only don't be so formal. I'm known as Sandy to my friends. Sandy? That's funny. A jockey named Sandy McKay used to ride for the Elm Tree Stables in Maryland. That's right. That's me. Really? Sure. Oh, boy, have I met a lot of racing bigshots today. Jimmy, remember our deal. OK. Now, the next time you come over, you and me have got to get together for some horse talk. You bet we will. Make it soon, will you? Sure thing, Jimmy. Swell. MRS. DOLAN: Dinner's ready. And am I hungry. [rooster] Here comes Mr. Spencer. MR. SPENCER: Good morning, boys. Good morning, Mr. Spencer. You're early birds I see. Yeah, we didn't want to miss anything. I'm going to make a tour of the stables. Like to go along? Oh, we'd love to. But maybe Colonel Whitney wouldn't like it. He won't mind if you're with me. Come on. No, Corky, you stay here and watch Mike. Understand now? That's a fine dog you have, Jimmy. He minds what you say. Well, that's because she's a thoroughbred. Thoroughbred, huh? Yes, sir. Yeah. Wait a minute, Hank. This is the Colonel's pet, Lightning Boy. Hi, you old fellow. Sure, I know. You want to get out and run, don't you? All right, you're going to get a workout this morning. Go ahead and pet him. He loves it. Hello champ, old boy. Gee, ain't he pretty. Yeah, almost as pretty as Mike. OK, Hank, come on, fellows. That's [inaudible], the nicest sprinters you'll ever see. I like them real well. What's the matter with him? There's nothing wrong with him. He's just taking a bath. A bath? Yeah, a sand bath. Oh, Doc, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine. This is Doc Scott, our veterinarian-- Jimmy and Speck. Pleased to meet you. Hi, Doc. Glad to know you boys. Well, come on, fellows. Good morning, Mr. Spencer. Good morning, Blackie. Gee, them is sure funny looking horseshoes. They aren't horseshoes. They are racing plates. The young man is a walking encyclopedia of racing information. It sure is. Not many people know what horses wear on their feet when they race, boys. Maybe you've got a couple of discarded plates you can give the boys for luck. I sure have. Have you got any taken off of Lightning Boy? Got a lot of them. There you are, sonny. [inaudible] Gee whiz, thanks a lot, mister. You're welcome. Well, we better be getting over to the track. Hey, would it be all right if I take Mike and Corky over to watch too? Sure, that's all right. Come on. How you want the boy handled this morning, Colonel? There's only one way to work him. If he wants to run, let him. Yes, sir. If you fellows will stay right here, you can see everything and not be in the way. OK, Mr. Spencer. All right, boys, up to the starting gate. Gee, he's a swell fellow, ain't he? I'll say he is. Oh, boy, now we're going to see some real racing. Not so loud, Speck. Over there is Colonel Whitley. I wonder what makes him look so grouchy. I don't know. Get Mr. Mulligan right up through here. Whoa. Whoa. Up. Well, I see that Flying Sun and Mr. Mulligan are up to their old tricks. Yeah. But they're not as bad as they used to be. You better [inaudible], Jay. [bell] Yah! They're off. [music playing] Watch them come around that turn. What time did you get? 49 and four fifths. I got 50 flat. That's not bad after the long train ride. It's not good either. Oh, boy, Colonel Whitley sure has good-looking horses, and fast too. Oh, they're pretty good. Here comes Mr. Spencer now. Enjoying yourself, boys? You bet. I'll say. What do you think of our racing stock? Well, they're pretty good. But-- But what? Well, I don't want you to think I'm bragging. But I'll bet you Mike can beat any I've seen so far. Did you say Mike? Who is Mike? He is. He's Mike. Well, what makes you think that delivery wagon horse can beat my thoroughbred? Just because Mike has been helping me deliver papers, don't get the wrong idea, because he's just a much of thoroughbred as any of your horses. Oh, he's no thoroughbred. He is so because my uncle bought him. And he knows racehorses. Well, we'll have to Mike on our track one of these days and see what he can do. Loan me one of your saddles. And I'll show you what he can do right now. [laughing]. Well, I will. All right, my horses will race yours. Good. Come on, Speck, let's unhitch. And just so you won't say I took an unfair advantage of you, I'll have a set of racing plates put on your nag. That's swell. Don't let him get your goat, Jimmy. Well, he can't call Mike a nag and get away with it. I know. You just bring him over to the stables. And we'll fix him up. OK, thanks. This colt of yours sure acts like he wants to run. Of course he does. You would too if somebody insulted you. You don't really think he can beat any of the Colonel's horses, do you? With them racing plates on, the Colonel's horses won't be able to see him for dust. OK, sonny, you ready to climb aboard? Just a minute. Corky, you stay with Speck and watch the race. I'm ready now. And Mike, let's go. Come on, Corky. MR. SPENCER: Uh, Jimmy, Colonel Whitley wants to discuss the conditions of the race with you. OK. Will once around the half mile track be satisfactory? Suits me. Suits me too. Now, you riders will be given a few minutes to warm up your mount. Boy, that kid sits in his saddle like an experienced jock. Yeah, and maybe his nag can run like an experienced racehorse. Oh, Mike. Now, listen, Mike, after my bragging on you, don't you dare let me down. You've got to win this race, understand? Get him straightened out there. [bell] Yah! [music playing] Come on, Mike. Well, that son of a gun, Jimmy's colt is leading Lightning Boy. [music playing] Come on, Mike. Come on, Mike. Come on. Well, what do you know about that? Jimmy's colt come darn near beating Lightning Boy. So I noticed. Not bad for a delivery wagon horse, wouldn't you think? You don't have to rub it in. Don't feel bad about it, Mike. It wasn't your fault. You could have won that race if I was a better rider. Congratulations, Jimmy. JIMMY: For what? Your horse beat mine, didn't he? By the skin of his teeth. Well, that's good enough in a horse race. I guess I did a little bit too much bragging. You didn't do half enough, Jimmy. The horse that beat Mike was last year's three-year old champion. You don't mean Lightning Boy? Yes, sir. Look there. Gee whiz, did you hear that, Speck? Sure, I did. He made Boy run a half of mile in 47 flat. Did you hear that, Mike? You nearly beat Lightning Boy. Thank of that. Jimmy, I owe you an apology and Mike too for calling you a delivery wagon horse. I hope you'll forgive me-- both of you. We will, won't we, Mike? How about being my guests for breakfast? -You bet. -That'd be swell, Colonel. Come on over to the house. Hey, Joe, pool the boy's horse out, will you? Come on then. And Mike was bred by a Texas horse horseman, Stephen Talbott. Steve Talbott, huh? Do you know anything about Mike's bloodlines? Yes, sir. Mike was sired by Bulldog and foaled by a mare named Molly Michaels. As a yearling, he was registered under Bull Mike, but I shortened it because I like Mike better. I don't recall any Bull Mike racing as a two or three-year-old. Do you, Colonel? No, I don't. That's because he's never been to a race. You see, when he was a baby, Mr. Talbott gave him to his daughter for a pet. And when she was killed in an auto accident, he couldn't bear to have Mike around his place. Oh, yes, I remember the incident now. Talbott was so broken hearted, he quit racing and sold all his stock. Yes, sir, that's how my uncle came to buy him. Well, you're a very lucky boy, Jimmy. You could sell Mike for a lot of money. Oh, I don't want to sell him. I'm buying him for keeps. I wouldn't sell Mike for a million dollars. Any mail for me, dear? No, mother, just one letter. It's for Jimmy from Uncle Joe. Good. Open it up. Let's hear what he has to say. Oh, Jimmy won't mind. All right. "Dear Jimmy, I regret very much that circumstances compel me to break a promise, which no doubt will hurt your feelings. I am so desperately in need of money, that I'm offering to sell Mike." Sell Mike? Go on. Let's hear the rest of it. "I am offering to sell Mike to the Kit Kat Racing Stable. And they will be over to see him tomorrow, as they can afford to pay me $700." There'd the old alibi. He knows Jimmy can't afford to pay $700. I wouldn't let him pay that much if could afford to. Go on. "Don't feel too bad about it because I'll find you another colt you'll like just as much as Mike. With love, Uncle Joe." [SARCASM] With love, Uncle Joe. A lot he knows about love. Oh, why did he ever leave Mike in Jimmy's care in the first place. He might have known that Jimmy'd become attached to him. Whoa, Mike. Here, Speck, you drive down to the shed and start to unhitch. I am going to tell mom about Mike. Well, I suppose Jimmy will just have to get over his disappointment. Mom! Mom! Guess what happened. Mike nearly beat Lightning Boy. What's the matter, sis? Why are you crying? Well, what's the matter with her, ma? She's feeling blue over a letter from your Uncle Joe. Oh, is he sick or something? No, dear. Jimmy, I've got some bad news for you. And it's going to hurt you terribly. I wish I didn't have to tell you. But you'll have to know about it sooner or later. Well, what is it, mom? Your uncle is so hard up he can't wait till you've saved enough money to buy Mike. You mean he's going to sell him to someone else? Yes, dear, to a racing stable. But mom, he promised me that I could buy him. I know, dear, but-- Then why can't I send him the $203 that I have saved and the rest later? Because the racing stable will pay him $700. And that's more than you can afford. So that's the kind of an uncle he turned out to be. Oh, Jimmy. You can depend on me. Mike. I am not going to let nobody take you away from me-- no, sir. Run away tonight-- you and me and Corky-- and join up with the gypsies. And nobody will be able to find us. Now, listen, I'll sneak out here around midnight. And we'll-- Oh, Jimmy. JIMMY: Yeah? Supper is ready. And mom is fixing nice, French-fried potatoes. And you know how much you like them. I don't want any supper. I'm not hungry. Don't be like that, Jimmy. I feel almost as bad about losing Mike as you do-- only-- Only what? Well, maybe we've been getting upset over nothing. What do you mean nothing? The men coming over here tomorrow have never seen Mike, have they? No, I guess not. Well, maybe when they see him, they won't want to buy him. I think you got something there, sis. Did you hear what she said, Mike? Maye they won't think you're worth $700 when they see you. Good morning, mam. Is this the place where Joe Dolan has a thoroughbred for sale? Why, yes. Well, I am Sam Hilder. And this is Dr. Pronnett. How do you do, Mrs. Dolan? How do you do? We represent the Kit Kat Stables. I presume Mr. Dolan wrote you about the deal. Yes, Jimmy got the bad news from his uncle yesterday. Jimmy's my 12-year-old boy. He loves that colt more than anything in the world. Now, I am sorry if we butted in on a family affair. All I know about the matter is that Dolan offered to sell a four-year-old colt to our employer. You mind letting us have a look at him? No. Come with me, and I'll call Jimmy. Thank you. I know how much this hurts your pride. But I don't want to lose you. And you don't want to get taken away from me and Corky neither, do you? Of course not. Now, if you would just stand still, I'd be through in a minute. Jimmy! JIMMY: Yes, mom. The men from the Kit Kat Stables are here. They want to see Mike. JIMMY: All right, ma. Now, you got a lame leg, understand? Come on. Come on. [music playing] So you're the men who want to buy my uncle's colt. That's right. Well, this is Mike, gents. I am sorry he's so dirty looking. But every chance he gets, he wallows in the duck pond. That's a fine way for a thoroughbred to act. Yeah, I guess he's got some mustang in him. DR. PRONNETT: How long has been limping like that? Well, not long. It comes and goes. I think he's got a touch of rheumatism. All right, we'd better look him over, Doc. And make it snappy. No use wasting much time here. You're right. [dog barking] Quiet, Corky. It's all right. I've seen all I want to see. Me too. Let's go. Well, thanks Jimmy for letting us see him. You're welcome. -Well, goodbye. -So long. Bye, Jimmy. We fooled them, Mike. We put it over on them. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Corky. I was only fooling to trick those men. And did we put it over on them. Thatta boy, Mike. Come on. I'll clean you up-- get that old dirt off of you. Come on. [chickens] [music playing] Believe me, Mrs. Dolan, I feel like a heel coming here to take your boy's pet away from him, especially after the clever way he tried to fool us. But I'm only carrying out orders. That's why I waited until he'd be in school. Well, I-- I'm at least glad you waited. We have the confirmation of purchase here if you'd care to see it. No, that isn't necessary. You'll find Mike in the corral. Well, I-- I am awfully sorry, Mrs. Dolan. [dog barking] Corky, stop it. [dog barking] Stop it, Corky. Come here. Corky, come here. It's all right. It's all right now. Thank you. [dog barking] Whoa, boy. Whoa, Mike, old boy. [music playing] Whoa, Mike. Come on, fellow. Easy now. Come on. Whoa. We aren't going to hurt you, Mike. Nothing we can do about it, Corky. I know how you feel. Steady, boy, steady. Whoa, whoa, Mike, whoa. Whoa, Mike, whoa. DR. PRONNETT: Come on, boy. SAM HILDER: Here boy, whoa. DR. PRONNETT: Come on, boy. Steady, Mike, steady, whoa, whoa, boy. Easy now, easy, come on. Whoa, Mike. Whoa. Whoa. That's my boy. Whoa. [horse whinny] [dog barking] Hey, Jimmy, what's he tied up for? I don't know. But I got a pretty good idea. Untie her, Speck. [music playing] [chickens] Mike! Oh, Mike! What's the matter, Jimmy? Ain't Mike out in the pasture? No, Speck. They took him away. Come on, Corky. What are we going to do, Corky? Don't feel too bad about it, Jimmy. You can buy another horse. I don't want another horse. If I can't have Mike, I don't want any. And I'll never speak to my Uncle Joe again as long as I live. I don't blame you, Jimmy. I wouldn't either. SAM HILDER: Come on, Mike, old boy. You don't know how good these carrots are. How about some nice corn, Mike? SAM HILDER: Sure, boy, have some of that corn. DR. PRONETT: Come on, Mike, what's the matter with you? Haven't you been able to make him eat yet? No, Miss Tremaine, you can't make a horse eat if he doesn't want to. We've offered him everything we could think of. Oh, here, let me try. It's no use, mam, he won't eat. He won't run either. He just sulks. Well, perhaps I'd better call in another veterinarian if you don't know what to do for him. The colt isn't sick, mam. I mean, not physically. So what's the matter with him? He's grieving for a stable companion, a little old dog named Corky. That's the truth, mam. Well, that ought to make our problem quite simple. We'll buy the dog. Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to do the buying. I won't. Why not? Because a little boy named Jimmy Dolan owns that dog. And he thought this colt was his too until his uncle crossed him up. Oh, I see. Very well. Give me his address. I'll talk to him. Oh, he lives over in Arkadia on Durango Road. I'll write it down for you. [chickens] Looking for someone, mam? Yes, Jimmy Dolan. That's me. I'm Kitty Tremaine. You mean the movie star? That's right. I came here to buy a dog. You must have seen the sign I put out in front. Well, I got two puppies left. If you come into the barn, I'll be glad to show them to you. Oh, but I don't want to buy a puppy. I want to buy this dog. She ain't for sale. But I'll give you $50 for her. No, you won't. $100? No, mam. How about $200? You're just wasting your time, lady. And besides, who do you want to buy this dog for? Well, you see, I happen to be the owner of the Kit Kat Racing Stables, and I-- Oh, you, are, are you? Now I see what you're up to. You're not satisfied with taking Mike away from me. Now, you want Corky too. But-- but Mike doesn't want to eat since I got him because he misses the dog. Of course he does. Don't you think me and Corky miss him too? I just assume die if I didn't have Corky. Oh, Jimmy-- since you won't sell Corky to me, I guess there's just one thing to do. I'll have to sell Mike back to you. Do you really mean it? Would you sell him back to me? I'd be happy to. Oh, boy, that's swell of you. Now, if you wait right here, I'll be back in a minute. Now, don't go away. Why, hello, Jimmy. Hello, Colonel Whitney. Is Mr. Spencer around? It's very important that I see him right away. Well, I'm sorry. He went to Los Angeles this morning. I'm sorry you lost Mike too. Jay told me about it. Yeah, that's what I wanted to see Mr. Spencer about. You see, I got a chance to buy Mike back again. -You don't say. -Yeah. You see, he won't eat or run or do anything for the Kit Kat Stables because he's looking for me and Corky. Oh, I see. Well, why don't you come along and tell me about it. Maybe I could help you. I'm afraid not. Why? Well, you see, the Kit Kat Stable owes my uncle $700 for Mike. And, well, I haven't go that much money. And I was sort of hoping Mr. Spencer would go in partners with me in buying Mike and take a train even. I bet you Mike would win plenty of races. Well, I'm sure glad you told me about that. You are? Why? Because if Jay was here, he'd, uh, jump at a chance to buy a half interest in Mike. Do you really think he would? I know he would. Oh, gee, I wish he were here. Well, that isn't necessary. I'll just give you my check for $700. Then when you and Jay get your money together, you can pay me back. How's that? Gee, but you're a swell guy, Colonel. It was just for a half interest in Mike. You'll never regret it, Mr. Spencer, because I'll bet you anything Mike will win the Santa Anita Handicap if you train him. But I thought your uncle sold him to the Kit Kat Stable. He did. But a miracle just happened. We got a chance to buy him back. You see, the Kit Kat cant' get Mike to eat or anything because he's grieving for Jimmy and the dog . So I'm advancing the money to you boys to buy him till you can pay me back. Oh, I see. Well, that's very fine of you, Colonel. I'm glad to have you for a partner, Jimmy. Thanks. That's the way I feel about you. Allow me to be the first to congratulate the new partnership of Dolan and Spencer. I wish you a lot of luck. Thank you, Colonel. Thanks a lot, boss. Well, I've got to be getting along now. Miss Tremaine is waiting for me. Then I think Jay better go along and help close the deal. Besides, you'll want to discuss your racing plans, and select your colors, and so forth. Here you are, Jimmy. Thanks, Colonel. You're aces. Well, come on, Jimmy. -My bike. -Well, leave it here. We'll pick it up later. -OK. Doc Scott wants to see you in the stables, Colonel Whitley. What's the matter, Colonel, got something in your eye? Yes. A little boy's gratitude. [music playing] I'm sure glad you're home, Mike. You know it too, don't you boy? Boy, you ought to have seen how glad Mike and Corky was to see each other. And you know something? Corky must have told Mike that we'd come to take him home because Mike went right up to the manger and started to eat some hay. What do you know about that? I don't know why dogs and horses should be called dumb animals. I don't either. I've seen plenty of them that were much smarter than their owners, Hi, Mr. Spencer, remember me? Oh, yeah, hello, McKay. Jimmy, I want to see you a minute. Yeah, sure. I got to go home, Jim, I'll see you later. What's wrong with him? Well, it's an old story. Is there anything wrong, Mr. Spencer? What's that ex-jockey doing around here? Oh, he's my sister's boyfriend. Oh, so that's it. Yeah, why'd you ask? Did he ever ride for you? No, but, uh-- But what? Confidentially, partner, he lost his jockey license for riding in a questionable race. Oh, I see. Well, I've got to run along. See you tonight. OK, partner. Mr. Spencer, I want you to know how much I appreciate the kindness that you and Colonel Whitley have shown to Jimmy. I think it's wonderful. It's been a pleasure, Mrs. Dolan. Colonel Whitley and I think Jimmy is a fine boy. In fact, the Colonel is a much changed man since he met Jimmy. Before you go, I'd like to give you a jar of my homemade jam. Well, I'd love it. I-- I hope it's strawberry. Good. Sandy, I think you ought to speak to Mr. Spencer. Evidently, he thinks the suspension of your jockey license was justified. Well, why should I explain to him? He means nothing in my life. Don't be so sure about that. He's Jimmy's partner now. And Jimmy has big plans for you. Big plans for me. What are you talking about? I don't dare tell you. I've been sworn to secrecy. All right, I'll find out for myself. OK. It's a swell homecoming you fixed for Mike, Jimmy. Yeah. Uh, Erin tells me you need about $125 yet to pay for your half interest in Mike. Yeah. I'd like to lend you the money, Jimmy. No, thanks, I'd rather not borrow any money from you. Why not? Did you ever ride a crooked race? No, I never did. You had your jockey license suspended, didn't you? SANDY: Yes. Why? Well, back East, I happened to be up on a favorite in a race that a gambling ring was using for a betting coup. I should've won that race. I was pocketed all the way. The stewards thought I was in on the fix. I was so mad over the raw deal they handed me, I never offered any defense. I just quit the racing game. That was a mistake, Sandy. But for some reason, I believe you. And I'd sure like to have you riding Mike at Santa Anita. Jimmy, I'm-- I'm way overweight. I know that. But you can train down. Other jockeys have to. Yeah, but I might have trouble getting reinstated. Nah, Colonel Whitley can fix things up for you. I bet you. Yeah, I guess he could at that. Sure, he can. What do you say, huh? Well, what do you say about that $125 loan I mentioned? OK. I'll speak to Mr. Spencer about you tonight and get everything fixed up. Right. But Jimmy, McKay never offered any defense. Is that the kind of a man you want to ride Mike? But he didn't do anything wrong. Nobody could get him to throw a race. All right, partner, if you think he's OK, I'll put in with you. Thanks. And you won't be any mistake neither, because, well, you see, he's going to be my brother-in-law pretty soon. Oh, so that's the way it is, huh? Yes, sir. Well, let's take a look in the condition book and see if we can find a race that Mike will have a chance to win. Good. Hmm? Let's see. Ah, here's one. Opening day-- third race. "Four years old and upwards, an allowance affair for maidens and non-winners of more than one race this year." And the distance is right. Yeah, only six furlongs. Mike will win that one in a breeze. That's what I'm hoping. But don't forget, other owners will be reading these conditions too and figuring out they can wake up a winner. I know it. [door bell] Come in. Well, if it isn't Sam McBride. Hi, Sam. -Hi, Sam. -How are you, boys? Saw you in the diner and tried to catch your eye. Heading West for the opening of Santa Anita, huh? Yes, California here we come. Me too. [inaudible] already on the ground working out. Is that so? Yeah. Sam [inaudible] is a swell layout. And the track is faster than greased lightning. You figuring on copping the first $100,000 handicap? Oh, now, quit your kidding. You know me better than that. What's up your sleeve, Sam? What's it worth to you to know? Plenty if it's a sure thing. What have you got? You remember that gelding I claimed at the fairgrounds last year? You mean Speed Demon? Yeah. Why that old hag [inaudible] only won one race this year. Well, it's more profitable sometimes not to win races. You gentlemen ought to know that. So you've been prepping Speed Demon for a killing. And how. He's been working a half at 49 and just galloping. I want you to notice the conditions in the third race-- the opening day. "Three quarters of a mile. An allowance race for maidens and non-winners of more than one race last year. Four years old and upward." Speed Demon can take that one running backwards. And he should pay at least 10 to 1. [music playing] There's Mike's name right there. Sure enough, it says, Mike. Well, you wanted me to tell you when he was ready to run. Well, he is. But is he ready to win? That's what we want to know. He's a cinch. Then you would advise us to bet the bankroll on him? No, I don't advise anybody to bet on horse racing, because I don't believe in it. Oh, I see. But if you feel like betting, don't let me stop you, because being a maiden, Mike will pay off in boxcars when he wins. Joe, get that bookie on the phone. I've got $2 that's going on Mike. So get it straight-- $5,000 on Speed Demon in the third at Santa Anita at track odds. Speed Demon-- $5,000 on the kisser if [inaudible] bookies will take it. I said Speed Demon. S as in sucker. P like in [inaudible] Yeah, that's right. Now, listen, Mike, I want you to get a good night's sleep because we're going to van you over to the track early in the morning. And I want you to be in thick, see? Now, listen, Corky, I want you to keep a good watch over Mike tonight. Understand? I got something for you. Here. Thatta girl. Good night, Mike. Good night, Corky. ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] Sweep a Lot is second and closing fast. Bright Woolly is running third. [crowd sounds] Lame Duck wins it by an inch. It's all very exciting. But when does Mike run? The next race-- see here on the program, mother, number 6. That's the number to watch. My brother's horse. Now, do exactly what Sandy tells you, Mike. And whatever you do, you've got to win this race, understand? Any final instructions, Mr. Spencer? No, you know what to do. So go out there and do it. OK. -Good luck, Sandy. -Thanks, Jimmy. Any instructions? No, just go out there and win that race. That's all I got to say. I'll do my best. [music - "call to the post"] Excuse me. Gosh, doesn't Mike look swell, partner? Best looking horse on the track. Hey, Sandy! Be sure to make Mike win. You're rooting for the wrong horse, sonny. What do you mean the wrong horse? If you want to pick up a little easy money, you get a ticket on Speed Demon. Speed Demon. Mike's going to win this race. ANNOUNCER: Mike with Sandy McKay up is 50 to 1. Mike sure does look good, doesn't he? ANNOUNCER: And Little Sam with [inaudible] is three and a half. Hey, fellows, there's Jimmy. Where? Down there with Mr. Spencer by the judge's stand. Oh, yeah. Come on. Oh, I'm beginning to see how it's done. That's why they have the numbers on the board out there. Look, mom, the odds on Mike are 50 to 1. I'm going to buy a $2 ticket. Do you want me to buy you one? You mean, if Mike wins, you'll get $100. That's right. I'll take two-- one for Jimmy. Hi! Hi, Jimmy, how are you? Hi, Jimmy. Hey, gang, he thinks Speed Demon is going to win. ANNOUNCER: The horses are in the starting gate. [bell] There they go-- number 2, Speed Demon, is going to the front, Molly O is second, and Powell is third. [cheers] It's Speed Demon by three quarters of a length. Molly O is ahead in front of Sparrow. Blooming Gus is running sixth and Mike four. [cheers] Yeah, Mike. ANNOUNCER: Speed Demon by a length and one half. Molly O on the left. [cheers] Speed Demon still in front by one length. Molly O is second in front of Sparrow. It's Speed Demon and Molly O. Sparrow is third and Little Sam fourth. [cheers] And here comes Mike closing fast from the outside. You can win, Mike. You got to win it. ANNOUNCER: It's Speed Demon and Mike [inaudible]. [cheers] It's Mike and Speed Demon. Yay! Come on! ANNOUNCER: Mike wins going away. Sparrow is second. -[inaudible] we won! -You bet you we did, Jimmy. ANNOUNCER: And Speed Demon is third. Nice going, Sandy. I knew you could do it. Sonny boy, let me ask you something confidentially. How did you know that horse would win? Because I told him too. What does that have to do with it? You see, I'm Jimmy Dolan of Dolan and Spencer. This is Mr. Spencer, my partner. We own Mike. Come on, boys. [music playing] Look what I got for Mike. Say, that's a honey. I'll say it is. But there's nothing too good for that champ. Hmm, you bet there isn't. Oh, look what I got for Corky. Well, Corky. Say, that's a mighty fine color Jimmy bought you. Nicest one I could find. You like it? Oh, that's a Jim dandy. That's for being such a good dog, Corky old girl. Jimmy, I came over to tell you that I've entered Mike in another race? You did? When does it go? A week from today in the Lincoln Memorial. A handicap. Oh, boy, you must think he's pretty good to enter him in that kind of a race. It'll give us a chance to find out how good he really is. He'll be stretching out from six furlongs to a mile and a sixteenth and running against better horses. How much is the purse? Enough to outfit your newsboy's club if he wins. Oh, boy, did you hear that, Mike? Do you really think he can win, Mr. Spencer? Well, he's got a chance. But don't count on it too much. Few horses win all their races. Colin did or Mondi did, and maybe Mike can do it too. I wish I had your kind of faith, Jimmy. Training horses would be so much easier. Well, we'll put him back in the training right away. So long. Bye, partner. Mr. Spencer don't think you'll do in the mile and the sixteenth race. But you'll show them, won't you? What if it is the Lincoln Memorial Handicap? That won't make any difference to you, will it, boy? Nah. And here's some info right out of the feed box. "Bet everything you can beg, borrow, steal on Fleet One in the Lincoln Memorial Handicap," signed Doc. Let's see, who's Doc? Remember the veterinarian we staked at Saratoga after we they bought him from the track? You mean, Doc Slagle ? That's the guy. His brother Bill works for the B & B Stables. They are the ones that own Fleet One. Say, that tip sounds pretty good. Let's take a look at the entry. "Nighthawk, Scottsman, Domino, Fireater, Fleet One, Nominee, Sweep On, Mike." Mike, that lets me out. I won't do anymore betting against that kid and his horse. Once was plenty. Oh, don't be a dope, Randy. The kid saw us. He's in over his head. He's right. He's probably putting him in a handicap just for experience. He won't get any more experience at my expense. Now sir, that kid's a jinx. Ah, you're too superstitious, Randy. As for me, I like Fleet One. Say, do you think you can get the Doc and his brother over here. I'd like to talk to him. Sure. The Doc will do anything for me. [phone ringing] Hello. Hello, Doc, this is Ace Carroll. Well, how are you, Ace? You got my letter, huh? Yeah, Bill will be in from the track tonight. I'm expecting him any minute. Yeah, well, you're good to stop over at the National Hotel, Suite 608. I've got a little job for you. OK, boy, I'll be seeing you. Goodbye. Oh, Corky. I'm sorry you don't feel well. This medicine I gave you will fix you up. You'll feel swell in the morning. Now, you go to sleep like a good girl. [music playing] [horse whinny] He's in there all right. [music playing] Whoa. Hold it. Ho. Hold it. Hold it. [horse whinny] [horse whinny] Hold it. Go get him, Corky. [dog barking] Oh. [inaudible] Get off! Get this dog off of me. Please hurry. Jimmy, what's going on down here? There's some prowlers in the barn after Mike. Corky is fighting them off now. I just got through calling Mr. Spencer. Jimmy, you stay here. You're not going out till Mr. Spencer gets here. But Mom, Corky needs my help. Never mind that. [music playing] [dog barking] [gunshot] Let me go, ma. Jimmy! [dog whimper] Corky! Corky! [dog whimper] Corky, are you hurt bad? Lay your head down. Mr. Spencer, they shot Corky. Where's Jimmy? Over there. [dog whimper] Poor Corky. [dog whimper] Mr. Spencer, Corky's been shot. Ah, don't worry, Jimmy. Doc Scott will take care of [inaudible]. What about Mike? Is he all right? I don't know. Well, we'd better find out. [dog whimper] What were they trying to do to you Mike, old boy? Funny, I guess, if I hadn't of been for Corky. Still full. Good thing they didn't get a chance to use it. I'll say it is. I'm sorry, Jimmy. I tried to save her, but well, I couldn't. She's dead. You should feel mighty proud of Corky, Jimmy, for she sacrificed her life to save Mike's. That makes Corky a hero. And heroes don't want their loved ones to cry over them. I'm not crying. Oh, Jimmy. [music - "taps"] [horse whinny] Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Mr. Spencer. Mom said you wanted to see me. Is there anything wrong? I'm afraid there is. Mike won't eat. And he won't train. He seems to be grieving for his pal, Corky. Yeah. Well, what are you doing with that dog? Well, we thought maybe Mike was lonesome for a stable mate, but it didn't work. Mike won't even look at him. Of course, not. No other dog would take Corky's place. I know. Hello, Mike. How's my boy? Don't be like that, Mike. I know you feel bad. But maybe you'll feel better if you and me take a little gallop. What do you say, huh? He's never acted like this before. He don't even pay any attention to me. Now what are we going to do ? The Lincoln Memorial Handicap is only three days off. Well, uh, I hate to say it, Jimmy, but I'm afraid we're going to have to declare him out. But suppose he never wants to race again. Sure, he will. Mike isn't going to grieve forever. He'll snap out of it in time. Do you really think he will? Of course. I think if we kept him in his own stable and pasture, he'd snap out of it sooner. I guess you're right. And besides, around home, he'll be closer to Corky. That's right. We'll declaring him out, huh? It's the best thing to do, Jimmy. Anyway, there'll be plenty of races for him later on, huh? [phone ringing] See who it is, Jack. Sure. Hi, Doc. Hello, Bill. Hi, Jack. Hi, Randy. RANDY: Hi, Doc. Hi, boys. What's the good word? Well, Randy, we just came over to collect the rest of our money. He won't run. "The number of probable starters in the Lincoln Memorial Handicap to run on Saturday was reduced to nine today when Dolan and Spencer declared their entry Mike." Good work, Doc. [music playing] I'm not blaming you for not wanting to race yesterday. I know you feel bad about Corky. But so do I. Now, I'll put you out in the pasture where you can get some good sunshine. JUNIOR: Oh, Jimmy. Yoo-hoo! Yes, Junior. I'm in here. Come on in. Hi, Junior. Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Mickey, old boy. I came over to say goodbye to you, Jimmy. What do you mean goodbye? We're moving to New York tomorrow. To New York? How come? My dad got transferred to another job. So we've got to go or he goes. I'm awful sorry you're leaving, Junior. So am I, because my dad won't let me take Mickey along. He won't? No. So I thought maybe-- maybe you'd like to have him. No, Junior, thanks just the same. But I couldn't bear to have any other dog around after what happened to Corky. [horse whinny] Do you suppose he thinks Mickey is Corky? Nah, but maybe he remembers that Mickey is Corky's brother. Maybe he does at that. JIMMY: Well, what do you know about that? How much you want for him, Junior? What I paid for him-- $15. It's a deal Wait right here while I get the dough. All Lightning Boy needs is a tightener, and he'll be ready to go. OK, Jay. Hello, Colonel Whitney. -Hello, Jimmy. -Mr. Spencer. What are you excited about, Jimmy? What's happened? A miracle. A friend of mine brought Corky's brother over to my house. And Mike has accepted him for a pal. You ought to see how they're romping together just like old times with Corky. Well, that is good news. Sounds like Mike's ready to go back into training. You bet he is. And that's just what I've been hoping and praying for. I know you have. So if he trains well, we'll start him in another race. Which one? Any one you say, partner, just name it. Uh, how about the San Juan Capistrano Handicap? Oh, that's an awful tough race, Jimmy. I'm afraid we can't get him ready in time for that. Sure, we can. We got two weeks. And that's enough for Mike. He'll be as sharp as a tack in that time. Well, it's OK with me if the Colonel has no objections to Mike being coupled in the entry with Lightning Boy. I welcome the competition. But don't forget, it won't be the first time Mike's tried to beat Lightning Boy and failed. That's right. But this time, you've got to be Dolan and Spencer too. Oh, boy, Mike and Lightning Boy-- what a race that's going to be. Any special instructions, Colonel? Yes, Bobby. Just take this horse off the pace. But don't be more than two lengths off the leaders. When you hit the seven-eighths pole, take him to the outside. He'll come on from there. And whatever you do, don't let Mike beat you. Yes, sir. Now, listen, Mike, I'm depending on you. So go out there and win this race. Understand? Now, Sandy, just judge your pace by Lightning Boy. Stay close to him. When he makes his move, you make yours. Yes, sir. And good luck to you. Thanks Don't worry about Mike and me. We'll be right up there. [music - "call to the post"] ANNOUNCER: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the first running of the San Juan Capistrano Handicap at a mile and one quarter for three-year-old [inaudible].

And we want a lot of baseball equipment. And when I want something more, I'll call you back. Goodbye. Gee whiz, that gym equipment sure is going to cost an awful lot of money, ain't it? Sure it will. But we don't care how much it costs, do we Jimmy? Of course not. Do you know how much Mike won on that race? No, how much? Oh, about $45,000. $45,000? Jumping Jupiter! [whistle] Yeah, and we're going to have a best newsboys club there ever was, ain't we, Jimmy? You said it, Speck. [door knock] Hello, Jimmy. Hiya, partner. You're just in time to help us plan on building up our new clubhouse. Well, that's fine. I brought you a present from Colonel Whitley for the new club. Oh, swell. Thanks a lot. What is it? Open it. And find out for yourself. OK. What is it Jimmy? I don't know. It's a picture of Mike. I think it's pretty. Look, mom. MRS. DOLAN: Thoroughbreds all. Isn't it swell, mom? [music playing]
