Welcome back to school after the holidays. I am Mária Drazdechová, your new class teacher. Together, we will be battling Russian, Slovak and history. I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am. But first I want to get to know you, so I will now read out your names, each of you will stand up so I can see you and tell me your parents' work or line of business Good'? Very well. Ambrožová, Katarína. So, Katka what do your mum and dad do? Mum works at the shop and dad is a carpenter. -So he could fix something for us. -He's more of a model maker. Let's ask him anyway, okay? Good, sit down. Bártová, Helenka. Dad works at a construction site abroad, and mum was a hairdresser, but now she's home with my baby sister. -Does she work at home now? -Only long-term customers. Good. Bína, Miloš. Dad drives a taxi and mum's at the housing co-op. And father says that if you ever need a lift, no problem. Thank your father for me. Binder, Filip. He's not here. Hančová, Janka. My parents are designers in Prague. -Wasn't grandpa in school administration? -No, he's retired now. Hampl, Josef. Dad's a mason and mum's a cook. -Come again? -Dad's a mason and mum's a cook. Kučerová, Danka. Mum's a lab assistant and coaches gymnastics. -And your father? -He works at the airport. -He's a pilot? -No, an accountant. Malinovský, Anton. My father's a judge. -Where? -At the district court. Šimeková, Zuzana. Mum's a waitress and dad works at the Crystal Bar. Němec, Juraj. Dad's a head physician and mum is a nurse. Doctor. Řeháková,Alenka. Father is an invalid. And Vojáček, Miroslav? -Mum is a greengrocer. -Where? -At the central... the central market. -All right. -She has a stand there? -She does. Good. Zimka, Ondrej. Mum works at the kindergarten and father died. -Good morning. -Good morning. Sorry that I'm late, comrade. -What's your name? -Filip Binder. -I see. And why are you late? -The tram was late. Now stand up and tell us what your parents do. My mum is a bus dispatcher and dad is a car mechanic. Fixes buses at the depot. Tell her. Dad is a former national champion in freestyle wrestling. If he wanted to, he could beat you all up with his hands tied. Good evening, I'm glad to see you all here at this special parents' meeting. Comrade Chvalovská will be taking the minutes. You probably know why we're here. What happened is serious and we need to state our position. I can promise that if we don't reach a conclusion, everything will remain between us. I have no idea what this is about. Excuse me, I want to ask why is comrade teacher not here? -That should be obvious. -What do you mean? That the person we're discussing is not here. Yes, and that is not right. First I would like to know what actually happened. We invited comrade Drazdechová, but she excused herself. I'm sure she did. Of course we informed her about today's meeting and she will learn the results in detail. -I’m sorry, but I don't like this. Shouldn't we wait for her'? -Couldn't it be on purpose? -In principle, this is wrong. -In principle? That's rich. -What's going on is right? Mrs Kučerová, it was you who initiated this meeting. It's about your daughter. We all know that. -I don't know anything. -Wait, wait, please. After much deliberation, I decided to call this meeting myself. -What do you think? -It's a chance to get rid of her. It's horrible what happened. I know. But she's the chairwoman of the Communist Party at this school. If at least some parents join, they'll have to do something. Jesus Christ! I've read your request to transfer the kids to another school. -But I haven't passed it on yet. -Why? Well, your address is in our catchment area. The nearest school that could take them is full. But most importantly, the reasons that you state are not the real issue here. We all know that. Write down the real reasons for your decision to do this. -And file an official complaint. -What kind of complaint? Here's a template of what it should look like. -Who will be handling it? -Send it to me. Once I have something specific, I can pass it on. But I need a place to start. Excuse me, how long have you known about this? Have you been waiting for something to happen? Look, my position is difficult. I am the head teacher, but comrade Drazdechová is the Party chairwoman. Her late husband was an officer and her sister lives in Moscow. If I am to do anything, I need to have solid information. It's likely that I'll be gone before I can achieve anything. But things have gotten so far that I've decided to take the risk. I'm afraid my signature would complicate everything. Yes, Mr Littmann. Please do not sign it yet. You'll only join once we have enough... credible witnesses. If we find any. -Seems most people like it this way. -Maybe not everyone. I don't want more stress for Danka. I want to move her to another school. You can do that. No one is stopping you. But we want this to end, don't we? Nothing will change. They'll sweep it under the rug. It's just us and you. What do you want to do next? If this weren't so serious, I'd look for other options. Could someone finally tell us what's going on? We do not know about anything she would do wrong. -We've always been satisfied with her. -That's hardly surprising. -What do you mean? -May I ask, Mrs Bártová, what are your daughter's grades? What she deserves, of course. Have no doubts about that. That's exactly what I doubt. -The young one's a darling. -Yes. She's a good girl. And hungry. Don't put that in your mouth! That's not for eating! What is it you have there? -So I think we're done here. -I see. Oh my, you have made me into a new person, Mrs... Bártová? Oh, this is fantastic. Fantastic. How much'? -Nothing, nothing. -Come on, that won't do. No, really. Don't, please. I'm doing this so I don't forget how. -Twenty crowns. -No, no, put it right back there. Very well. But I owe you. -Helka, go put her to bed. -Okay. Lovely girl. Very well. Helka should look at the exercise. Lesson 5, exercise 3, nouns and verbs. -Thank you. -You know, since my husband died... It's been difficult for a lonely woman. So I rely on good people such as yourself. You have hands of gold. The closest person is my sister who's in Moscow. A thousand kilometres! I can't even send her anything. It was easier when my husband was alive. Not even medicine. When her son is ill, I can't send her medicine. Wait a minute, didn't Danka's father work at the airport? Maybe he knows a pilot, and maybe the pilot could take a package. Mr Kučera? Do you think he would? Don't tell me this isn't familiar. Your phone rings in the evening... Mr Ambrož, the lampshade still isn't right. I don't know what you did. Fix it again, would you? No, that is not familiar to me. Mr Řehák, well, pick up some pâté for me, maybe some cutlets... Milk would be nice, too. And marrow bones. But don't oversleep! Goodbye, good night. Watch your toes. -Hi, dad. -Hi. Come here. -How was it at school? -Nothing. Did she pick you? Did you raise your hand? What did I tell you? One more fail and you're done with gymnastics. I don't care what mum says about it. If you want, I can help you with your homework. The teacher wants something from you. She needs something done. She wants to smuggle cake to her sister in Moscow. What? -Did you hear what the teacher wants? -Yes. What is this communist pig even thinking'? She wants to send some cake by plane to Moscow. I'm not getting fired because of her. Couldn't you try asking someone? A pilot or a flight attendant? No, I couldn't. For one thing... I'm an accountant. I don't work with flight crews at all. -And sending food to the USSR is forbidden. -That was the start. And the next to the blackboard... Come, Danka. Let's give you a chance to improve those poor grades. So... What was the homework? Read the text "Our Family", learn vocabulary and prepare a speech about your family. Go ahead. My family is big. Mother, father, brother, sister and I. Wait a minute. You don't have a brother. Go on. -My father drives a tractor. -No, he doesn't, Danka. He works at the airport. -What does your mother do? -My mother is a milkmaid. What are you saying? She works in a laboratory. You didn't do your homework. Very poor. Very poor indeed. -But I learned it yesterday with dad. -Poorly. You told us to learn what's in the book. This is the third failed grade. It isn't looking good for you. I'd like to have a word with your mother. Maybe trainings are a distraction, damaging your school performance. Sit down. Are you suggesting it was revenge? Our daughter's grades were poor only because I refused to risk my job. -Could we be the only ones? -She got a bad grade. So what? Our boy gets those, too. We punish him... And he studies harder to catch up. -Big? -Bolshoj. -To study? -Zanimatsja. -To work? -Rabotat. -Free time? -Svobodnoe... vermja. Vremja. There's a stain on this shirt. I have nothing to wear. -The water isn't running. -What am I supposed to wear? Ask the water company. All I can do is brush it off. Another failed grade? But we did this yesterday and you knew it. There you have it. I will not be blackmailed. And I'm not kissing anyone's arse! Everyone who cares about their kids' grades does it or wants to get them into a secondary school. Okay, I'll establish communication with comrade teacher. You shouldn't communicate with anyone. -What's this? -What do you think? You never bake these, they're not healthy. -She brought them. -I clearly said I was not doing this. -Throw these away too? -Yes, why are you even asking? Go. Mr Kučera, are you here to see me? Come in. Welcome. -Good afternoon. -What is it? Can I go? Dad will kill me if I'm late for training. You should have thought of that earlier. You'll stay until you're done. -Would you like some coffee? -No, thanks. If you're too busy... Oh, never mind Filip. That's no problem at all. -You really don't want anything? -I don't know if I can talk here... Binder, you can go! But you're finishing it tomorrow! And no running in the corridors! Boys. They always keep fighting. Well, that's that. How about a glass of something stronger? -Homemade. -No, really, thank you. I'm sorry, comrade teacher, but I have to disappoint you. Well... What happened? It's about the cake for your sister in Moscow. Oh, that unfortunate thing. It's a problem, isn't it? It's a huge problem. There's no way around it. You see, I'm an accountant. I count plane tickets. I'm not in contact with flight crews at all... And it's strictly forbidden to give them anything to send abroad. L didn't know it was so difficult. -I do apologise. -No, there is no need to. It's all right. Maybe if it was something else, but this can't be done. It's just that your wife told me... She doesn't know how it works. We're not the Pony Express. She meant well. I'm glad that you understand. What a mess I've made. I'm sorry. Please forget about it. Sure you wouldn't like a drink? -Come, sit down. -Maybe a drop. Really just a little. I'm driving after lunch. L can't drive myself. Since my husband died... I have a cottage with a garden and have to get there by train. I'll probably have to sell it. I don't know what else to do. I could... sometime... If you needed... very urgently... To go to your cottage... l could drive you there. Would you do that for me? Well... I'll take you up on that. -And eat the cake. -Well... -Cheers. Jesus, so much sugar. -How far along are you, Mr Ambrož? -The lamp's fixed. Don't leave before I check it! It mustn't fall off again. It won't, comrade teacher. Be sure of that. Very well. Thank you. -No, I thank you. Bye! -Bye! Well... so... -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thank you. And Danka should work harder. Yes. Hello, Kučerová. Mária Drazdechová, Danka's class teacher. Good evening, Mrs Kučerová. I just wanted to tell you not to worry about the cake. I asked comrade Fajtová, the mother of Evička from fifth grade. She's a crew dispatcher. Can you imagine, for her it was no trouble at all. So I'm glad that it's all sorted out. By the way, Mrs Kučerová, Danka's performance has gotten much worse. Maybe you should think about it. Maybe sport is too exhausting for her and she can't concentrate at school. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Not at all. Goodbye. Mum, will you help me revise? Are you suggesting this is why it happened? -Couldn't it be your situation at home? -What do you mean by that? The girl does top-level sports. She's under pressure, neglects school. Her sport is nobody's business. She never neglected school. I'm sorry, head teacher, but I'm not listening to this. Comrade teacher recently lost her husband. It's difficult for her. Of course. What's wrong with helping each other? -I'm not ashamed of assisting her. -I'm glad to help. Look, what happened to your child is serious, I am not denying that. But you can't blame the teacher when a child breaks down from stress. Exactly. I'm shocked, head teacher, that you got involved in this. You are publicly denouncing a colleague who does her job well and whose individual approach to children is exemplary. I think you are blaming her for your own failure. How would you feel if a teacher said something like that to you? She indeed should not have said that to the girl. It's wrong and unethical. Oh, please, I've been called worse things so many times. Excuse me, but that's different. You're an adult, she is a child. We're at school, and teachers represent the highest authority. The judge. They stand for justice. This really should not have happened. As I said, it was confidential information, kept secret precisely -in order to protect from harm. -Which clearly happened here. Could someone tell me what the teacher said to her exactly? I can't keep picking you, Danka. You had your chance and wasted it. -Sit down. -But I'm prepared. I learned with dad. He said you'd test me. He did? I'm sorry, but you should have prepared earlier. -There are also others here. -Please. -Sit down. -Helenka Bártová. Come here. -That's not fair! -What's not fair? -She knows what you'll ask. -That's not true, you filthy liar. -It is true. Her grades are good because she knows the questions. She knows them? Who told her'? Do you think I told her'? Are you suggesting that I'm cheating? -Well? -I didn't want to. -But dad won't let me go to trainings. -I see! So you're telling lies, accusing all of us here because all that jumping makes you neglect school. Who told you this? She did. She boasts that she knows the questions thanks to her mum. -What? That's a lie. -It's true. Sit down, Helka. There will be no testing today. Cow! Not everyone can have perfect grades. Some people are good learners others have different skills. Like gymnastics. But in sports, you sometimes lose. And should not blame others for it. Don't you think? Helka would probably fall off a balance beam. But she wouldn't blame the referees. -I wouldn't even climb on it. -That's a different kind of gymnastics. Because Helenka... knows her limits. Can you face the truth? -But I've been preparing! -Don't be hysterical. Calm down. You aren't a study person. You have a talent for sports. Like Filip here. For all I know, you could be world champion one day. But your intelligence test scores are by far the worst in this class. So any kind of advanced studies is probably out of your reach. Kučerová is an idiot. -I can't believe that. She makes it up. -That's for your meddling! "She was so nice and promised to test her!" Now you see where it got us. -This is unacceptable. What do we do? -I have no idea. -I’ll see the head teacher. -Do you think she'll do anything? They're all afraid of her. Including the head teacher. -So what do we do? -Transfer her to another school. -And accept defeat? -Do you know what Danka told me'? -That she isn't going back. Ever. -But she is. -Someone else will leave. -What a fool you are. Is your uncle's name Brezhnev? Her sister married a Russian. In Moscow. You'd have to change the entire class. The entire school. Not just school. The entire country. New school rule: queues are ordered by IQ. -Idiots go last. -Didn't you hear? She'll be sent to a special school anyway. Comrade, please, pick me! You tosser! If this really happened, no wonder she took it so hard. We all know children can be cruel. -But if it's true... -It's not. -How do you know? I have the results of all the IQ tests of this class. And Danka's results are not close to being the worst. Comrade Drazdechová was lying. Yes, she was lying. You think that after you sign the complaint, it's no longer your fault? I will write another about slandering a person behind her back. There is no point. Just as expected! I also signed it, and my wife who is on night shift now. It's not just about the Kučera family. I'm surprised you complain, Mr Binder. That's quite unexpected. Do you claim your son's performance is also hindered, as suggested, by your lack of loyalty towards the teacher? In other words, not supplying French cognac, veal cutlets... Or hard to find medicine, am I right, doctor? Not fixing her furniture, baking cakes for her... Sending your child to help clean up her flat. My wife did it too, to help our son, not cause problems. I made her stop. It's not right! Not cause problems! We all know the medieval methods you use. And we know what results teaching with the rod can have. You should be the first to thank her for her patience. We all know you beat the boy. It's the only communication he knows, so he also uses it at school. My only regret is that I was blind. And that I wronged my son. -And hence the complaint. -It's shameful. Excuse me, friends, but let Mr Binder finish. His brat beat my son so bad he was afraid to go to school. -Broke a brand new watch. -He's like all boys his age. -Binder loves the retard. -He's a hermaphrodite. He has no need for women. Who's fighting? You're all staying here after class! -I have training, comrade. -ls that where you learned this? This is what your father supports. One, two, three... After class! I was glad he did sports. Better than being idle. I was tough on him. I thought it was the best I could do. He understood. He was good. Until this year. Started bringing home notes. Missed trainings. He never did that. I beat him so much before I realised it was that bloody teacher's fault. She won't pick me, intentionally. -You drew that? -I can draw anything you like. That's cool. Have you already done that picture of Winnetou kicking Drazdechová's arse? Show me. Good morning, children. Sit down. -No testing today, it's my birthday. -Happy birthday! Thank you. Today I'd like to tell you a story that happened to my mum when she was a bit older than you today, OK? It happened during the Slovak Uprising, which was when? -Nineteen forty-four. -Yes. In the mountains above the village, they were still shooting. But my mum learned that the guerrillas fighting in the mountains were hungry. So she decided to bring them some food. Today, we can't imagine what war is like. Or hunger. You have everything. You often even refuse to eat what they make for you in the cafeteria. My mum decided to take the basket which they used for mushrooms, put in some jam, bread, bacon, nuts and apples, and went to the forest. And as she walks along, feeling like Little Red Riding Hood. She became afraid, because anything can happen in the woods. She came to a clearing, and realised she didn't know where she was. And that she should turn back. But what about the food? Leave it there? What if instead of guerrillas, it was found by animals? But then she realised she was not alone. There was someone else. She turned around and saw behind her a big, strong man. A guerrilla fighter! Tall as a fir tree. He wore a military jacket, a helmet, of course. Medals on his chest and across his shoulders a machine gun. Only later she realised he was very handsome. He smelled of petrol and fire, had stubble on his face and very friendly blue eyes. My mum was out of breath and just stared at him. Then she picked up the basket, handed it to him. He hung his machine gun on the other shoulder but very carefully, not to frighten her took the basket, smiled -and said... -Danke schön! Who said that? Who was it'? I know it was you. You laugh, you bastard? Do you know what you said? I didn't say anything. I don't even speak German. Liar! We'll take this to the head teacher. Come on, we're going! Take your report book with you! I'm not going anywhere. It wasn't me. Stand up when I'm talking to you! I said that you said it, which means you said it! You think you can insult me? You and your father? The head teacher's office. Now! Go yourself. I'm not going. Stand up and give me the report book! Right now! -Go. You see how hysterical she is. -Right now! Get stuffed! You bloody little annoying bastard! -Mum's asleep? -Morning shift. -Don't toy with me. -I'm studying. It's upside down. I didn't say you could go. Sit down. -You don't like it anymore? -This'? Don't play dumb. Wrestling. Don't you want to achieve something? -I do. -So why skip trainings? Look in my eyes. What's going on? Teacher is pissed off, keeps complaining. -And now you skip trainings. -This is pointless. How do I explain that my own son has no discipline? School ends at one, training starts at three. It's a 20 minute walk. What do you do in those 2 hours? Do you think I'm a fool? Obviously. That's the only thing you can do! Do you think you're God? Screw that. Screw wrestling. Screw everything. Don't touch me again! You have no idea what's going on. All who kiss Drazdechová's arse are fine and those who don't are harassed. -Like who? -Danka, for one. Why do you think she misses her trainings? Why? Why are you making so much noise? You know I get up early. Something at school again? The teacher called about that washing machine. What a mess. Can't you ever clean it up? -Can't even eat here. -What about a washing machine? Do you ever listen? His teacher needs her washing machine fixed. -I don't work for free. -This isn't for free, as you can see. -What's with Danka'? -She's not well. Ate something bad. Danka, you and Filip visit the teacher at home? What do you do there? -We help. -With what? We clean, hang out the laundry, beat the carpets. -They all do it to improve grades. -When? -After school. -Instead of training? What is she thinking'? That she's a feudal lord'? -She asked us to smuggle cake to Russia. -Short supply, eh? Filip does it for me. He helps me so I can improve my grades. -What to do? -I don't know. Please, Mr Binder, don't do anything. 2.50. Good. Capsules, powder, okay. You can go. -Put it there. -Finished. What do you mean? Who's doing the rest'? Okay, go. Alenka, to the pantry. You know where the pantry is. Yes! Hello, Mr Binder. You're here to fix the washing machine. Your wife promised. So glad you found the time. Come on in. I'm helpless without my husband. All alone. Do come in, but take your shoes off. This is Mr Littmann. Karol's father. -Filip's new classmate. -Pleased to meet you. -Hello. I'll come some other time. -No, I can... No wait, you just arrived, Mr Binder. Mirko, not there, place it here and then you can go. I'm right back. Mr Littmann, stay here. Drink your coffee, try the cake, I'll just show him the washing machine. Are you still here? There's the bathroom. I don't know what's wrong. Turn it on, it makes a noise, but doesn't wash. -Could be dangerous. -I’m not here to fix the machine. -No? -I want to talk. -But I have... -About Filip. -Why are you closing the door'? -Nobody needs to hear this. -Open it. Just to be clear... My son will not wash your dishes or beat your carpets. No one is forcing him to. And I thought you knew about it. -Maybe he was ashamed to tell me. -Ashamed that he was helping me'? -Yes, exactly. -Come on, comrade Binder. -"Mister" suits me fine. -What do you think you're doing? -I'm talking to my son's teacher. -You entered my flat pretending you would fix my washing machine and locked me in the bathroom to threaten me'? I'm saying my son is not improving his grades in your flat. Neither he, nor Danka Kučerová. Are we clear about that? But my children like it. They love coming here! They're not your children. You don't have any. You are not their parent to keep them busy in your household. Your job is to teach them at school. -Open the door and leave my flat. -Yes, but first listen to me. Do it right now or I call the police. You do that. They find abuse of power interesting. -Whom will they believe, I wonder? -If Filip's grades get any worse... Like Danka's did... I'm not getting blackmailed by you. -You judged me wrong. -You're right about that. Goodbye, Mr Drazdech. I could expect that a man sentenced for assault whose son is a simple brute... One more teacher's note you've made up about my son, and you have a problem. -Are you threatening me'? -Think about it. -You'll be very sorry for this. -We'll see. Václav, Václav! He attacked me. I'm glad we finally understand each other. He was threatening me. I'm so glad you're here. Two outcasts, helping each other... -Did they connect your phone line'? -Yes, it works. Thank you. Good to hear. Good to hear. -What do you think she'll do? -Nothing. -She'll be careful now. -You're nothing against her. She knows people. She'll tell, and our boy will pay. No education. Life fucked up like ours. -Working shifts for a pittance. -I will complain. Will you? Who will take a lawbreaker seriously? You know I was defending you. That drunk Bolshevik was rude. -Don't act like I'm a thief. -Of course you're not. But they see it differently. You're a troublemaker. -And you're dragging the boy into it. -Oh yes? What did I do? Instead of fixing the machine, you threatened her. Do you want to teach our son whose arses he needs to kiss? Don't play the hero. Tomorrow, you're buying flowers. And you'll apologise, or we're finished, darling. We're finished, what else is new? I come home, make dinner, wash and hang the vests, because you have night shift. I tiptoe around, then have a wank and go to sleep because you have a headache after work. And who'll bring home the money? With your record, you could at best clean windows. -I'm not apologising. -Then I am. -Don't you dare! Don't make me mad, Hana! -It's for the boy! -That's the point! Let that bitch try. Let her try! We will complain. Transfer him to another school. You don't have to sleep with me, but we're doing this. You are right. It's disgusting. We're not taking part in this. Listen, you did the right thing, and I admire you for it. -How do you want to do it? -Maybe I'll go to the head teacher... I wasn't asking about that. I would like to ask who actually signed the complaint. You, your wife, Mr and Mrs Kučera... Four people against all of us who have a completely different opinion. I wanted to allow everyone to state their view of comrade teacher's competence. Very well. Anyone else who wants to complain? This is a bad dream. Are you all afraid? No, it suits you. You like sewing that bitch. She says jump, you jump- Doesn't anyone give a fuck what happened to the girl? -Please watch your language. -I’m a working man, I speak plainly. But I know what I'm saying, if you like kissing someone's arse, excuse me, buttocks, feel free. -How can you allow this? -Mr Binder, this is a school. I almost forgot. Feels more like a business. -Please. -We know who you are. -Come again? -Don't pretend. -Say it. -There's no need. -We know who you are. -Say it. -We know your past. -The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. -What the devil are you talking about? -I can explain. Mr Binder was sentenced for violent criminal activities. -Do you deny that? -I don't and I couldn't. This wanker who thought he was untouchable, like you, was rude to my wife. So I kicked his pasty arse -and now his meetings are stand-up. -There are 30 witnesses here. One more crude word and I'm filing a complaint. If he doesn't leave, I will, and there will be legal consequences. I will not be insulted. Mr Binder, I have to ask you to leave the room. -No. -Didn't you hear her'? -Yes, and I heard you twat. -What did you say? -I'm being honest, comrade. We comrades value honesty. Never mind me, comrades. Go on. -Excuse me, where is the lavatory? -I will show you. Mária, this is your new pupil, Karol Littmann. Welcome. I've heard a lot about you. The class is looking forward to you. And this is Mr Littmann, professor of astrophysics. -I know. -Former. -I know that as well. Pleased to meet you. I'm sure we'll get on well with Karol. I hear you draw well. You're in luck, it's art class now. Remain seated, children. Just put your brushes aside and pay attention fora while. This is our Karol. You may wonder why "our". After all, you don't know him. But he is ours. Because he is from an incomplete family. He only has his kind father who is unfortunately all alone. Now you may ask, where is his mum'? Everyone must have a mum. Not everyone. His mother went abroad without saying goodbye and stayed there. She betrayed our country, our socialist regime, but the worst thing of all, she betrayed her Karol. Now listen very closely. No one is responsible for their parents. No one can choose whether their parents are good people or not. Unfortunately, his mum was a disappointment. But that doesn't mean he will remain all alone. Because we will help him. With everything. -Let's promise we won't betray him! -We promise. -Could I go to the lavatory? -Yes, go. This way. What a relief. These meetings. I thought I'd burst. I never miss this. Smoking in the loo. It's pure nostalgia. -Want one? -I do, actually. I quit, but I could use one. Perfect. If the caretaker finds us, it's off to the head teacher's office. Listen, Mr Littmann... I hope you don't mean to join in. You have your own problems and the teacher has been protecting you. So some loyalty would be in order. -What do you mean? -Don't pretend you don't know. You don't know what the others will do. Some can't trust their own wife. I wouldn't go back if I were you. Think of your son. In any case, this will be over soon. Excuse me. If no one else has any complaints, then I think we could finish here. Yes, Mr Řehák. You raised your hand. I'm sorry, I know you're in a hurry, but I have something to say. I'm an invalid and my wife is an accountant, so we don't make much. We couldn't be very useful. My wife sometimes baked a cake. But I didn't like that our Alenka, instead of being at school, had to help comrade teacher do her shopping. I asked comrade teacher not to send Alenka on errands around the city. That I could stand in a queue for her myself, since I'm an invalid anyway. So we agreed on that. But I don't like what I hear. I'm wondering what Alenka's grades would be if I didn't do it. We don't really know how our kids are performing. And when I hear what happened... It could have been us. Do you see? My wife and I felt guilty, dishonest. We thought we were the only ones. -But you did it. -Yes. That's what I'm saying. So you should keep quiet. We thought Alenka didn't have a head for languages but perhaps that is not true. What a hypocrite you are. First you profit out of it and when the wind changes, you twist it all around. We can't give like others give. Medicine or expensive things. You know, every Thursday, I woke up at six to be first in the queue when the shops open at 7:30. And what do you want now? Well... If it is possible... We would like to sign the complaint. If we can. -You can't be serious. -I’m not listening to this. Excuse me, but I really have to go. -I'm needed at the hospital. -Want a lift? -I'm going that way. -You are very kind. I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to add. Try to see it from my perspective. You know that I work at a decent hospital. If someone asks for help, then I, unlike you, am happy to oblige. Would you say no if you didn't mind? See? I'm sorry about your daughter. But I know a great psychiatrist. Call me. Goodbye. Excuse me, I would like to sign the complaint. -Excuse me'? -Where can I sign? You of all people want to complain about her'? What a nerve. It should be us complaining. That our children share a class with your son. Excuse me? First you let him trade Tuzex vouchers, and now this... One, two, three! Go on, take them. What are you doing? Whose is this? Empty your pockets. You too. All of you. Put it here. You too. Empty your pockets. -You brought a gun to school? -What is going on'? What is this? Foreign goods vouchers. Is this yours? Leave. I will handle this. Leave! -The vouchers are yours too? -No. You really can't bring this to school. It's just a starter pistol. Dad used to swim. The boys wanted to see it. Tell your father to see me as soon as possible, okay? You may go. -Good evening, Mr Littmann. -Good evening. -I couldn't come earlier. -That's fine. Did Karol tell you? Come in. Take your shoes off. Here are some slippers. -Come in. -Thank you. I have made coffee. Please, sit down. It can't be easy, doing everything alone. -Trust me, I... -Did something happen? -Yes, it did. Look... Karol is a sensitive boy. It must be very hard for him. He wants to be part of the group, and I do understand that, but... See for yourself. I apologise. He knows he is not allowed to take it. Well, boys and their guns. I understand that. My husband was a soldier. But it's not allowed at school. And this... What's this? We'll let that slide. He knows now that it's forbidden. What is? He can't be buying off his classmates like that. Go ahead, count them to see if it's everything. Excuse me. I thought your wife sent some foreign currency and you changed it for vouchers. Yes, Drazdechová? Mr Řehák... Well, pick up some pâté for me, maybe some cutlets... Milk would be nice, too. And marrow bones. Good, good night. Excuse me. Look, I don't want to make a fuss. I understand the situation... The loss. You don't know how much I understand. Keep these and buy something nice for Karol, okay? But I can't do that. It's not mine. -Whose is it then? -No idea. But I can't keep it myself. Mr Littmann, I know how you feel. I often think about you. What you're going through, what you must suffer. I want you to know that I'll be happy to help. We're human. We must help each other. -I can't take something that isn't mine. -You do not have to fear me. Not me. You have lost some trust. But it doesn't have to be that way. I'm on your side. Your and Karol's. -Excuse me, but... -Contact me at any time. With confidence. How about coming to lunch? You and Karol? -It would be a pleasure. -Perhaps. Very well. And Karol should look at exercise 6, lesson 17. -Goodbye, Mr Littmann. -Goodbye. -And goodnight! -We could kill her. -For me'? -For us all. What's your problem? She likes you. -No, my dad. She's all over him. -She's chatting up your dad? Can a teacher screw a parent'? Isn't that illegal? They're not screwing. Hello. Karol? Is someone here? Good evening. -I’m sorry, I thought you'd be home. -Evening. Karol has some problems learning, so we're doing some extra classes. -Thank you, you are kind. -Well, you never came to that lunch. Sit down. It will be all right with Karol. He's a clever boy. The cake is from Mrs Řeháková. She's a good soul. Keeps bringing me things. I was admiring the telescope. Karol will follow in your footsteps, right? You must miss astronomy. The observatory, the stars... Right? It's mostly mathematics. Measurements. People tend to idealise. It must be hard, giving up something so interesting. Your scientific work. To know so much and not be able to use it... I don't think it's right. It's not fair. It's not your fault what happened. Don't take this wrong, but I can't understand how a woman can do that. Leave her family, her husband, her child... Don't be angry with me for saying this. I don't have children. I wanted them so much... My husband and I thought we'd adopt one. A boy like your Karol. I lost my child very early. In the third month... Excuse me. -I don't know why I'm telling you this. -That's all right. I brought you some borscht. My husband loved it. Do you like borscht? With meat, sour cream... -I’m sorry, but... Oh, come on. You must be hungry after all those windows. There's fresh beetroot. Mrs Vojáčková gave me some. Here you go. She's a very nice person. When she gives me something, I'll call you. -I wouldn't do that. -Why? MY Phone is tapped. Tapping your phone... What is hostile about you? You're the one who stayed. The one taking care of the boy. I'll write a report that you're taking excellent care of your son that you're making sure he's active in the youth organisation and I'll send it to the right places. I know people. One thing is clear. You should make your position clear. What position? You should apply for a divorce. Eat or it will get cold. Excuse me, but Viera, my wife... She's top of her field. She gave everything to her studies. Graduated with honours. She became head researcher at thirty. In my field, I was a foot soldier. She's a general. The best. There was no room for her here. So she had to go. Is that an excuse? She traded family for a laboratory. And they moved you from the academic district to this dump. That's awful. Taking revenge on defenceless people. Forgive me, but that's what this flat is. Revenge. How about taking a job as a caretaker at our school? I'll talk to the head teacher. She owes me. The job comes with an apartment. Karol could walk to school in his slippers. In time, you could open an astronomy club. Your own little observatory for children from our school. You already have a telescope. -Where can I sign? -You're not signing. Why not? Anyone can give their opinion. -I hope you won't. -I'm not a parent. -I must talk to my son. I didn't know... -So you didn't know? Then you were not misused. So please keep quiet. -Sorry, but I don't have... -Then be quiet. -I want to sign the complaint, okay? -Who's harming you? We know about your relationship with her. -What? -You know what. -She favours your son. -Wait, wait... -Do you then admit that some children... -This does not concern you. -So stay out of it. -But you just said so. Mr Littmann wants to sign, so let him sign. They have a measly five signatures. I didn't want to get involved, but I'm writing a petition to defend the unjust slandering of a good person. -Which person is that'? -Very amusing. Come on, people. It's not rocket science. We all want the best for our kids. -When did you need to leave? -What? -The hospital. You should be ashamed, Mr Littmann. She pleaded for you despite our objections. -I feel sorry for your son. -I warned you. You decided for him. Goodbye. Before you leave, there is one more thing you should know. The performance of kids taught by Mária at secondary school exams is without any doubt significantly worse than the results of her colleagues. Her success rate is less than 15 percent, compared to our school average of 40-50%. Unfortunately, those are the figures. We'd like to withdraw our signatures. There's too few of us. I would sign, but I can't decide for the parents. Let's close this, then. Thank you all for coming here. This concludes our meeting. We must deny all initiatives in this matter. We received information from some parents, presented it to the other parents... And determined it was false. That's the end of it for me. It was our duty. Now you need to raise her salary, give her some bonuses... Screw this. No time to play heroes. Come in! Mrs Králová and I have decided to sign. We all stood by you. Doctor Němec, judge Malinovský, Mr Bína, Ambrožová, the Hampl couple... Simply everyone. Or they kept quiet. Those people can't hope to achieve anything. -So no one else joined? -No, just the Kučeras, the idiot Binder... And that cripple, what's his name. The invalid. Řehák? But he didn't sign. -But at first he did. -Alenka's father? I don't get this at all. He was so eager. The shopping was his idea. I would never dream of asking anything like that. You can relax. When he saw they were alone, he took it all back. So no one else dared? There was the father of the new kid. But I think he was under pressure. Mr Littmann? That can't be. Why would he sign anything like that? With these people, you never know what they think. Of course. Fora while, I thought it was all his idea. Until he moved in, everything was fine. I must admit I feel hurt. That the head teacher would allow this. If you saw her face when we all stood up together like one man, or woman, and walked out... The whole thing was completely pointless. Listening to you brings tears to my eyes. If only my husband were here, to see and hear how you all stood up for me. He wouldn't let this slide. But I'm just a weak woman. And you know me... I don't hold a grudge. Why are you awake? I want to go to mum. -Maybe you'll get there soon. -How? The Red Cross. But you're coming too. Mum applied for a divorce. That's not true. That bitch is lying to you. -Don't call your mother that. -I'm not talking about mum. I'm talking about Drazdechová. Who wants to be my new mum or something. She's lying and you believe her. She's a malicious cow. You shouldn't say that. About anyone. Not even about your teacher. Maybe she's a good person inside. I've come to say I forgive you. You signed, didn't you? Why? Why would you? You think anyone listens to you? That the husband of a traitor matters to anyone? Are you that naive or that stupid? We rule here, Václav. Not people like you, Kučera or Binder. Karol will be lucky if we let him clean toilets. Good night. Hello? Hello, who's there? Is that you, Václav? As you know, comrade Drazdechová will be unable to work for some time. Until we find a replacement, Slovak will be taught by my deputy. -And history and Russian by me. -Sit down. First we'll revise what you already know. It may not be much, but we'll manage. Let's start with Samo Chalúpka, the poem Branko. The bells are ringing in Zvolen, Branko is being chased. They are chasing him up and down. Through the valley of the Hron. Why is it, Branko, tell us. Did you do anything to them? They claim that] am guilty, but I see the guilt is theirs. Life was good, in ages past, Slovaks were a proud people. Oh, their lives were so free like a fish in a still stream. Filip became a car mechanic. After an injury ended his sports career, he remained faithful to wrestling as a coach. With the help of the Red Cross, Karol joined his mother abroad. He later graduated from the art academy in Stockholm. He was reunited with his father after 7 years. Danka studied medicine and is a recognised neurologist. Sit down. I am Mária Drazdechová, your new class teacher. Together, we will be battling Slovak, English, religion and ethics. I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am. But first I want to get to know you, so I will now read out your names, each of you will stand up so I can see you and say out loud what their parents do. Okay? So, who's the first one?
