My connection to the prison is, uh, my family doesn't like to talk about it a whole lot but, uh, my great-grandmother, she was there and... a very, very wealthy woman and... And it's just not something that really I've ever wanted to touch bases with, but I understood, I was too young, but from what I heard my mother and the rest of the family say was that she was a very, very nasty woman. And I would assume that having been at the prison, she probably earned her time there. The Old State Penitentiary is now closed to tourists after concerns of structural instability. Conspiracy theorists, however, claim that ghostly sightings and increased paranormal activity are to blame for the closure. My dad went to a Halloween sleepover there and they had this guy dressed like an Indian, big old Mohawk, scared the shit out of him. Anyways, they used to have sleepovers there all the time. So my dad told me. Guess they canceled them ages ago. Stuff about weird stuff that wasn't supposed to be there. They're right, I've seen it. Really? Did you get it on tape? I did. But like others, everything I recorded was blank after I left the prison grounds. So all that survives are these interviews conducted in other places. Wait, what? Really? Did you get it on tape? I did. But like others, everything I recorded was blank after I left the prison grounds. All that survives are these interviews conducted in other places. They accused the state tourism board of continuing a so-called government cover-up of the 1939 prison riot that led to the deaths of three prison guards. Uh, some of the "cool kids" went stealing from them all to prove that they weren't scared. I never did. Because you weren't cool, or because of the haunting? Probably both. Am I allowed to say shit? My uncle or somebody from our family worked there during the riot and they told me that weird shit happened. They're taking that place down because it's evil, that's what I think. Have you been there yourself? Been there? I worked there 32 years. My aunt's step-sister's husband's uncle, he saw this Indian in Siberia. It's like a ghost. Scared the crap out of him. This is Sara. Hey, Matt. Watching a video about the prison, it's pretty creepy. Okay, see you then. I know this for a fact. That prison is so scary. I'm kind of psychic, you know? I was there once, and all of a sudden I smelled roses all over. And they weren't any roses. - That place is scary. - Aww! I don't like scary. Hey folks, big news from the Skeptic and the Scientist channel. I'm talking huge. Take a look. We are the last crew to film in the old historic prison located in the High Desert of Idaho. There were hangings there. There were serial killers. There were prison riots. There was more. Now we haven't been inside yet, but this facility has had more ghost sightings than almost any other location. You know me. I don't believe in ghosts. But my partner Sara here, she's got some pretty special plans. And if there's anybody that's gonna prove me your favorite skeptic wrong, it's gonna be your favorite scientist, Sara. Got all the batteries charged up? Yeah, making sure everything's working. What about you? Is your gizmo, whatchamacallit, thing-a-meter still working? It's not called a gizmo, whatever you just said. It's a synchrotron kinetic energy pattern testing computer. Oh. My bad. Well, that name's going to be pretty hard to market once all the paranormal geeks and freaks start lining up to buy one. Probably, uh, think about shortening it somehow maybe. In the industry, the electromagnetic field meter's abbreviated to EMF. If I wanted to market it, I suppose I could use an acronym. And I'm sure people will come from all over to buy it. So, why don't you explain to our viewers what it does. Okay. Um, for years, paranormal investigators have been using EMF to detect the presence of residual spectral energy. It's theorized that ghosts and such disturb the earth's natural electromagnetic force. But I'm hypothesizing that ghosts do not emit electromagnetic radiation, but instead synchrotron radiation, which occurs when charged particles accelerate radially from... Yeah, I'm just gonna stop you right there. I don't think anyone's gonna know what that means. Okay, let's put it this way. If this light turns green, that means there's a human present. If this light turns blue, that means there's an energy indicating a spirit. Well, that's easy enough. Got it. - I'm here! - Oh, hey. Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - Hey, Ashley. Where's Matthew? He said he needed his beauty sleep, - and for us to come pick him up. - Yeah, figures. - Um, do you guys already have your mics on? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Ready to go? - Yeah. Yeah. Just got to pack this camera up and we can hit the road. The prettiest honorably discharged defender of our freedom has arrived. And the rest of you. Here, let me drive. Uh, Jacob, which cameras did you bring for the stationary setup? Oh, we've got several yellow apple mobile cameras ready to go. They're pretty good in low light, not too expensive. And you brought the hand-held zoomer camera too, right? Yes. The hand-held zoomer, right here, buddy. Yes, do or die time guys. Woo! You know, I hope that we don't have to cancel the show. I mean, I enjoy working with most of you. Don't worry. Once we pull off this episode and our viewership rises, Matthew's going to think that they're tuning in just for him - and he'll keep the show going. - Hah! My trust funds got to be good for something. Let's make sure that this camera's angled... Oh, hey. I'm sorry. Sorry. Is the word director on the back of your chair? - Well, no, but it's just the... - And if there were a chair that said director, would you be sitting in it? No. It's kind of hard to hold the camera when you're sitting down. Hmm. Exactly. See, you're here to hold the camera, and I'm here to direct. That's what I do. That's why I'm here. Oh, and be eye candy for our viewers. All hundreds of our viewers. Hey, we have a very loyal following. Pretty soon we're going to be paying people to watch this show. No, man. No. With Sara's new doohickey and the fact that we are the last crew to film at this prison, people are gonna be tuning in. Are you sure they know we're coming? Mhm. Seven o'clock. Right on time. - Go get them. - Hello? Hello? I'm coming, I'm coming. All right. We are in business. It's open. Who is this guy? What you got there? - Well, it's... - That is a spectrum radiation energy meter. Synchrotron kinetic energy pattern testing computer. That's right, it's the synchrotron kinetic energy pattern testing computer. Or just SKEPTC for short, it's named after me. It's not named after you, and please put the camera away. It measures the... space time continuum through the synch... the synchronicity, the synergy of the spooky. The... Give that back to me. So last group to get a permit to film here, huh? Yup, and we're pretty stoked. Make sure you capture as much as you can before the sun sets. Oh, why? Because you can't see in the dark obviously. And we don't have many sources of light. Well, we better get our tent set up with our receiver gear. So these walls were actually built with stone the prisoners were forced to quarry. Then they built the walls, trapping themselves inside. It's kind of poetic. There's one of the guard towers. They were numbered counterclockwise starting in the north-east corner. You can see you've got a great line of sight from every corner. Even though this place closed after the 1939 riot, I feel like I've been stuck here ever since. Want out as much as the prisoners did. Seem like pretty short walls. And dining hall. Last big riot of '73 that closed the place down. Used to be a beautiful building, not so much anymore. - It's really quiet. - There's not much around here. This is where they housed the women. Any deaths in here? Anyone of significance? Mary Beth Flake, the only female serial killer in Idaho history. I saw interviews with some of her relatives. Everything associated with Mary Beth Flake involved four red roses. The rose bush outside of this cell block has four roses blooming on it year round. Legend has it that when the roses start to go away, shit is about to hit the fan. Mary Beth came from an extremely wealthy family. So how'd she become a serial killer then? Her father owned, among other things, the largest construction company in the Northwest. Helped build parts of this prison, in fact. Her father used to bring her onto construction sites. Hoped she'd take over the family business eventually. She was an only child. She stood to inherit a lot of money when her father died. Right. By all accounts, Mary Beth was a homely woman, but there was no lack of suitors to marry into that inheritance. So did she find someone to marry? She did. But two months after she married her new beau, her father died under mysterious circumstances. How mysterious? Her father was only 50 years old and in perfect health. At a family gathering he was found dead without a mark on him, in the estate's rose garden. Since she was married, her husband had complete control over the estate she inherited. Always blaming the husband. Right. Looks like you did your homework. Mary Beth knew if she divorced her husband, whom she suspected of killing her father, he would get the estate. It drove Mary Beth off the deep end. It was the law. And since women couldn't vote yet, it was unlikely to change any time soon. And so she became a homicidal maniac? Did she kill her husband to get her money? Too obvious. No. Instead, she became a tornado of grassroots politics, encouraging the women of Idaho to write their legislatures, sign petitions, speak out at every opportunity. She figured if women could vote, they could change the law that gave men control over all their lives. Soon those that were loudest in their opposition to giving women the right to vote also began to die under mysterious circumstances. So, she started killing everyone who was opposed to women's suffrage. Only the 12 most vocal in their opposition. Who was the 12th victim? - Her husband. - It was common knowledge that her and her husband were in a less than cordial marriage. - Well, she was homicidal. - Well, so was he. Wow, cute couple. - And she got the death sentence. - She did. When I was looking it up, I couldn't find out exactly when she died. No one knows. Somehow she managed to escape and was never found. Dun-dun-dun! What? Uh, do you guys smell that? - What? - I smell roses. - Oh, my God, I do, too. - You do? Because there's a whole bunch of rose bushes right outside and the wind started to blow. If you're new to our program, remember that pretty much 100% of "paranormal activity" can be explained away with reasonable reasons. Reasonable reasons? Very eloquent, Matthew. Roses aren't in season. Residual roses. Oh, yeah, residual roses. That must be it. At least the roses smell nice. Shove it, Matt. Shove it, Matt. Okay, there's a woman in there. There's a woman's voice. I heard a woman's voice. Ha-ha. No, there is a woman in there and I was all alone of course. Someone said, "Shove it, Matt." Which is what Jacob said, And it was his voice echoing, but it sounded like a woman. Hey, asshole. Lights on. If you need to say anything to primary cam please cover your light or just turn it off. Got it. Oof! Hey, why don't you explain what you're doing and how that thing works. Uh, okay. I'll try to keep it really basic, but every human, every human emits electromagnetic radiation. That's what an EMF meter measures. Paranormal investigators theorize that when a spirit or ghost, if you like, doesn't fully leave this plane of existence, it leaves behind spectral energy, which is just another form of electromagnetic energy. What this device does is it detects synchrotron radiation. And what is synchrotron radiation? I'll try to put it really simply, again. But synchrotron radiation is the radiation that occurs when charged particles accelerate perpendicular to their velocity as opposed to parallel, which is what happens in electromagnetic radiation. Uh-huh. And so, how will this thing help us find ghosts? I hypothesize that spectral energy emits electrons at inconsistent rates. Right now, the device is detecting electromagnetic radiation all around us. Our hearts, our brains, and the earth itself. When this other light turns blue, that means that it has detected synchrotron radiation. There may be spectral energy, but if there's human energy present, then it will always take precedence. So it's hard to tell. And how do you know it'll work? Like how did you test it? Um, I actually haven't had a chance to test it yet, but I'm hoping that tonight will prove my theory. So you've never actually seen the blue light go on? Well, the blue light hasn't gone on... And you won't, because there's no such thing as ghosts. So, your theory of this science is, the blue light comes on, there's a ghost nearby. Um... Yeah, I'm hoping that with this and the other evidence we acquire tonight, we can confirm. And by other evidence, she means the audio and video evidence she's hoping to capture using this, the networked YIN vid kit. This is a state-of-the-art, wifi-enabled, real time recording, blah blah, blah. So when we don't actually see any spirits or spooks nearby, can't blame the equipment. Um... there really isn't much else that can cause synchrotron radiation. So I'm confident that if we detect some, we can prove the existence of spectral beings. Can you show us the inside of the other buildings now? Right this way. We'll go see solitary confinement next. Welcome to solitary, or Siberia as it's called here. Uh-oh, no. That's creeping me out so I'm just gonna stay out here. Wasn't gonna fit in there anyways. Yeah, I'm good too. Three prison guards were murdered in there by an inmate. How did that happen? No one knows for sure. Cell door was locked when the bodies were discovered inside. This door only locks from the outside. Guards all had their keys in their pockets. I sure would like to know what happened, but I guess I'll never know. Oh, why is that? Besides the fact it happened over 80 years ago, and we still haven't figured it out? Do you know why you were the last to be given a film permit? Uh, no. They're tearing this place down. Gonna put condos here. Land is worth more to the state by selling it than by keeping it as a museum. So, we really are gonna be the last people to capture the spirits that reside here. I wish, or we'll be the last to finally prove that there's nothing here at all. Give me a camera, I'll set it up. You know I'm pretty good at holding big sticks, I can help you with that if you want. Yeah, okay. Uh, not getting a really good signal here, you guys. The walls of this building are pure concrete. Therefore, any signal is gonna have a challenge in here. A lot of things have issues in here. Will it work? Yeah, it'll work. I'll take you to death row next, it's the part of the prison that's had the most sightings. What? What's up? - Did you hear that? - Did I hear what? It was... Here it is, death row. Home of some Idaho's most nefarious criminals. As you can see, these cells aren't exactly very accommodating. Hm. I think I'd rather hang than be stuck in one of these cells. Whoa! I couldn't fit in there when I was ten. My mom used to feed me a lot of mashed potatoes and gravy. I don't think they were exactly designed for comfort. Ugh, but it's better than those solitary cells where they had to sleep on the floor. The guards weren't very sympathetic to the death row inmates. They really used to fu... mess with these guys. Used to drag their Billy clubs along these cell bars. Clink, clink, clink. Every time they walked up and down this hallway, clink, clink, clink. Drove some of those inmates nuttier than they already were. And if they complained, off to Siberia they went. Are you hearing anything? No, but we'll all moving and talking, so maybe I should get room tone. Oh, good idea. So we'll all be quiet for a moment. So what we're doing is we're gonna all be quiet and we're going to get room tone. That's going to give us a nice baseline audio sound for this room. That way if anything happens outside of that we'll be able to hear it easier on playback while we're watching and listening to the stationary camera, so, shh. Room tone, death row. What you doing? Cut room tone. We are recording room tone. So we can get a nice base level of what this room normally sounds like. Room tone, death row, take two. What if I normally talk in this room? Cut. Dude, it doesn't matter, okay? We need to get this, we need absolute quiet. Yeah, quiet everybody. Room tone. Room tone death row, take three. Action room tone. Stop, stop it. You guys should have seen the look on your faces. Where did you even get that? This? Yeah, that. - Oh, whatever, man! - Guys please can we get this, because I need it. Room tone, death row, take four. Got it. Cut room tone. Guys ready to see the hanging and drop room? Absolutely. Before we do that, let's set up a stationary camera over there so that we can get this hallway. Did you know that it was the Idaho drop room where the phrase 'drop like a hot potato' was coined? I did not know that. You guys are so gullible. Hey, sorry I can't help out more, you know. - Got all this gear. - No problem. You told me once that you joined the team because of a friend of yours. I'd like to hear the story about your friend, if you don't mind. Yeah, friend isn't the right word. We were closer than that. I've always been a tech geek. I was ecstatic when they assigned me to the mobile radar unit. We would set up near hotspots to track enemy drones and small surface to surface missiles. That's where I met Chris. Your friend? Mobile radar is a two person crew. One watches the display while the other has down time to sleep in the truck, or eat, or read. But we still spent a lot of time together, even when one of us was on down time. We had a lot in common. It wasn't long before both of us realized that we had deeper feelings for each other. Then what happened? We had troops that kept the area around the unit free of hostile forces. I don't... I don't know how he got through. But in the middle of the night a hostile with a shoulder missile launcher appeared on the hills above us, and he fired on the unit. And Chris was manning the radar at that time? It was my shift, Jacob. I don't understand. I switched with him. I was tired, I didn't get a lot of sleep the night before and I wanted a few more hours. It should have been me out there. It should have been me. Chris died because I was tired. It's okay. Here. No, it's okay. I'm good, I'm good. Anyways, they discharged me and sent me home. And I was really lost when I got back. Like really lost. And I've never been religious, but I wanted to know if there was something more. So I joined the first paranormal group I could find, which happened to be you guys. What was that? Sara, you okay? I thought I saw something. Someone hanging. Let's go to the drop room. See if he's there. It's more like a cow shower. Why the drain? It's for the defecation. What? She's right. They'd drop, neck would snap, they'd shit themselves and the drain is there to clean up the mess. Oh, lovely. Let's go ahead and set up a stationary camera in here to capture the room. I think we're wasting our time here. When you think about it, if I'm a ghost and I could choose anywhere in this prison to haunt, I'm sure as hell not going to want to stay around, pun intended, this shit hole. Literal shit hole. Interesting hypothesis. I mean, look, your neck snapped in a violent death, you shit yourself as you went. You really going to want to hang around here like it's the Ritz? No way. That actually kind of makes sense. Never thought I'd hear you say that. I mean, we still have the cameras set up in the death row cell block. And I'm sure those inmates were in constant fear of their impending deaths, so there's probably some emotionally based residual spectral energy there. Maybe you guys aren't as dumb as you look. Thank you. So, you obviously agree with me that there are no ghosts here. Hey. What did the other teams claim they found? They all said they saw something, so I heard. So you heard? You weren't with them? Listen honey, I've been here a long time. I don't normally do these late night things. Only did it because they're tearing this place down and wanted, just wanted to tonight. What's with this mannequin? His name is Black Wolf. He was Mary Beth Flake's arch enemy. Why did she hate him? He wasn't white. Hey guys, I'm set. Here's the laundry room. The mangle table. Inmates use this to insert clothes so they can do hot steam presses. A lot of inmates got their arms ripped off in feeding clothes into that thing. This is where a lot of the sightings were? Actually, over in this room. This is where people have claimed to see a lot of spirits. You look through there, you'll see the shower room. Many men died in there, especially during the final riot. The one in '73, closed this place down. No living human's been in that room in over 20 years. What was that? It's a fog machine and a tape recorder. What? Yeah, those are on a loop. They're, uh... They're there to give the tourists the ambience of the laundry room. Okay well, I'm going to set this camera up here. You okay? Yeah. It's still not going to get anything. Okay, let's see what we got. This one? Let's... Whoa, look, look, look. Go back. The laundry room. What did you see? He didn't see anything. What the... That's probably just the Park Ranger messing with us. Wasn't me. We need to go check this out. You're getting all this right? Yeah. How'd you do that? Listen, I may have embellished the mangle table deaths some, and sure I kind of knew the sounds were going to play, and the steam was going to hiss. But I can honestly say I am not making anything move in the laundry room. And I swear on my death, it is not me making that shadow appear. I believe you. And I don't. Look, look, look. The light turned blue. What do we do now? Exactly what we came here to do. Make Matthew look good. Fine. We did it. Curious. It's unplugged. Sorry, it's just me. You good? I'm good. I'm good. I think we really do need to check the cameras. There's definitely something happening here. I'll catch up. Yeah. Need to prep the SKEPTC. Everything associated with Mary Beth Flake involved four red roses. The rose bush outside of this cell block has four roses blooming on it year round. Why are there only three roses? Are you guys trying to get us kicked out of this place? Look, I think it's just adorable that you two have a crush on Ashley. But cutting one of the roses goes completely against our contract with the Historical Society. What are you talking about? No one gave me a rose, Sara. Okay. No more ghosts for that woman. Roses aren't in season. Residual roses. Oh, yeah. Residual roses, that must be it. Legend has it that when the roses start to go away, shit is about to hit the fan. What is that? It's a blueprint of the prison. Where did you get that? In Mary Beth Flake's cell. The one that's locked and nobody has access to? Yes, Matthew, that one. Look, look, there's pencil markings right here. So you just went into Flake's cell and the blueprint was sitting there? Actually, no, rose petals led me to Mary Beth's cell. And then when I got in there, there was a tear in the mattress and the blueprint was in there. Of course, that makes total sense. So, who would do that, and why? You know what, we're close. I can feel it. We're close. Oh my God! Do you know why there would be blueprints in Mary Beth's cell? Mary Beth wouldn't want you in her cell. You may be getting help from the other side. She has it in for four people at the prison, and they hated her right back. Hey, be sure to capture the action, Matthew. All of that is recording, I'm capturing plenty. Whoa, whoa. What was that? What? There. Was that there before? No, no. That was definitely not there before. That is not creepy at all. Matthew, will you go check that out and we'll just watch the monitor? Yeah. Jacob can come with me. Come on. Follow me. Hello up there. I thought you said that never worked. Nothing. All right, looks like we're good. Let's go. Hey, way to investigate. You really think something's up there? I don't know man, maybe. Hmm. So Sara's got you believing that stuff too, huh? How many investigations have we been on where we've had any hard evidence? I don't know. You have to admit, this one seems a little weird. Yeah. I think Ashley's starting to pick up on something here. I doubt it. When she and I were having coffee last week she didn't mention believing in any of that stuff. It really didn't come up, it was more of a personal conversation. What the hell is he talking about? We never had coffee. Hey, can we get up there? Uh, it is behind this locked area, so no. Well, how are we supposed to investigate if we can't get up there? Listen, it's like the Ranger said, it's just a... Whoa. Did you see that? Yeah, the cell door slammed, was super loud. And do cell doors slam all by themselves? When there's a breeze in the cell block. A breeze. Are you serious? Yeah, well, I wish we had walkie talkies. Matthew says they're not in the budget. Yeah, but I'm sure his hair cream was. Good one. Whoa. Where'd they go? Yeah. Matthew? Matthew! Dude, not funny. I want your brains. Contacts. I've been saving them for something like this. The look on your face, priceless. You are a dick. What'd I do? You know that this is her thing, right? Sara believes in the paranormal. I know, but the show is called 'The Skeptic and the Scientist' for a reason. I don't. No, no. Actually, the show is called 'The Skeptic and the Scientist' because you have a trust fund and you're paying for it. If it were properly titled, it would be called 'The Scientist and the Asshole.' Now, now. Don't fight. Not really your business. Yeah, but I've decided I kind of like you guys. And I've got this idea, I think you could help. I'm not really in a position to fund any new ideas. Fair enough. I fear dying in Siberia. Hey, I heard a voice. Don't pity me. - No, I was going to say... - I mean, he was right. It's not like SKEPTC's working. - I... - It's not like we found anything. I think I just... What am I doing wasting all of my time with this? Did you know my mom died when I was ten? No. The night after she died I was crying in my pillows, and I felt something sit at the end of my bed. At first I just thought it was my dad coming to check on me, but then I... I looked up and it was my mom. It was real. It was very real. And what happened? I mean, nothing really. She didn't reach out for me or say anything. She just... ...stared, as though to tell me that she was all right. And that I was going to be all right. And then she just faded away. I'm sorry, what were you trying to tell me before? Oh! Let's just not go back to Siberia. Here... Here, tissue. - Is it clean? - I'm not sure, it's... Thanks anyway. No worries. Well, we'll probably find something a little bit more - exciting in death row, so. - Yeah. - Let's go. - All right. When my little brother died, my mom hired a psychic for like basically the same thing. You know, she just, she wanted to know. And, uh, the psychic told us that when spirits stick around they want to know they're at peace with their passing. And my little bro was. I didn't know that about your little brother. Hey well, we all have our own stories. Yeah. Hey c'mon, let's go check out that camera in Siberia. - Okay. - Yeah. Whoa. It says here when they used to use these cells for solitary confinement they didn't have any pre-assigned times. What does that mean? Apparently, it means when they threw you in here you didn't know for how long. Could be a day, a week, or a year. They never told you. Well, that's some bullshit. Indeed. No wonder these guys went crazy. Hey, don't lock me in here. I would never. I'm not Matthew. Thank god. What the... Oh. Holy shit. Nope, nope. Mm-mmm. I am done. Sara. Sara. What is your connection to Siberia? Show yourself. I did not sign up for this. I'm done. Done. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Where's the fire? No, no, no. I'm done man, I'm done. No more. Wait, what happened? Where is Sara? I don't know. Oh, hey. Did you see anything? I know that somebody doesn't want us in Siberia. Did your doohickey turn blue? No, I left it in death row. Hey, come here. It's okay. Listen, your worth is not tied to the SKEPTC, Sara. I know that I can figure this out, and I know that the SKEPTC will work again. And when it does, I'm the one that's going to be funding this channel. I am not dying in Siberia. Jacob, I really think that we're onto something. You can't quit now, we need you. Yeah, stop being such a wuss. You're not helping. You know, 17 film crews have been in here. Yeah. Not a one of 17 got anything. Okay, well that means that if we don't, nobody else will. This isn't real. This is all in your heads. - Guys, we're done. We're done. - Yes. - Sara, I love you, - JACOB: Thank you. but don't hold your breath on your thingy saving this channel, okay? If you don't capture any ghosts on camera... Then maybe we'll come back and do an episode on one of the new condos. What are we going to do? We're going to capture as much footage as we can while we're here. We only have a few more hours until daylight. Ow, ow. - What? - God, ow. Some feedback or something. - From where? - God. Death row cell blocks camera audio feed. - Maybe it was just a glitch. - Pull up that camera. - That doesn't look like a glitch. - See. What feed is that? Cell block four. Do you hear anything? - Yeah. - What is it? I don't know, beeping? Let me listen. Hey, my money, my headphones. Go ahead. It's not beeping, it's a chirping. It's a smoke alarm. Let's go check it out. Jacob, please you have the camera. I would really rather not. I'll go. You ladies stay here. - I don't think that- - MATTHEW: Be right back. Famous last words. Wow, okay. Not annoying. What do you think of room tone now, Ashley? Okay. Open door. I guess. Is it annoying you? What's he doing? There's a beep, so there's got to be a fire alarm. What fire alarm? We don't have fire alarms. I know. If you're... Oh, oh! Ow. - It's locked in the cell. - Come on. - Hey! - Stop! What happened? What happened? - The mannequin, it... - It what? Okay. Ha-ha. Very funny, Matthew. Dude, we ran here thinking you were hurt, man. This is bullshit, okay? I thought you said Ashley was behind you? She was right there. Look! We don't have time for this, we have to find a way to get out of here, okay? We got to get out of here. We still need to find Ashley. Wait, Jacob, wait! Don't leave me alone. Ashley! You're going to be... Ashley. Ashley, you're going to be okay. Come on. Is she breathing? Yeah. Yeah, but she's not blinking. Oh. Ashley? Come on, come on. There you go. How did I get in here? We were hoping you could tell us. Mary Beth Flake, she told me to stay away from Siberia. Stop! Dude, what are you doing? I didn't believe and now we are stuck here with them. - We are not stuck here. - Because he is gone, too. He... No, you are fine, Ashley's fine, he's going to be fine. We just got to find him and get out of here. Can't, I can't, I can't do it. Hey, look at me. Look at me. You are Matthew Heights, okay? You can do anything. You're the man. And we have more than enough footage, so let's go, together. Get the hell out of here, get the ranger. Okay. Okay, okay, let's do... What the hell was that for? Just making sure you're 100%. Let's go. What are we doing? Uh, he's at the end of the hall. - What? - Can you see anything else? No. Then let's go get him. Let's go. Are you okay? Hey. Are you okay? What happened? What happened? Go, go, go! No, no. This is not happening. The door is locked. There has to be a way out of here. Just because you say it doesn't make it true. What do we do now? There has to be some way out. The inmate who escaped found some way, we just have to find it. Wait, wait, wait. I thought that was just one of those stories - that you were telling us. - No, that really happened. - What? Okay. - Do not mess with us. I'm not. She figured a way out of here, we just have to find it. Are you sure someone escaped this cell? More sure than you can imagine. All right. We need to figure this out now. Wait, you said that she escaped somehow. Does this have something to do with the blueprint? The inmate who killed those guards and escaped was Mary Beth Flake. Her father owned, among other things, the largest construction company in the Northwest. Helped build parts of this prison in fact. And you said that her father built some of this prison, which buildings? The administration building, the hospital, the commissary and Siberia. - Siberia. - Oh, my God. Right here. This is where the pencil marks were. Oh. This wall sounds like it's made of wood, it's hollow. Okay, all right. Siberia. What is that? It's a blueprint of the prison. Where did you get that? In Mary Beth Flake's cell. Mary Beth Flake is the one who didn't want us in here. She's the only one who could have killed the guards and escaped through these walls. That's why she was so defiant during her trial, she knew she could get out. After six months of being here she spit on a guard and they threw her in Siberia. Bingo. Oh, my God. But if Mary Beth killed those guards and escaped through the hole then how did they fix the wall? There was a cover up, literally and figuratively. I think there had to be some other story. The roses, you know, the four roses that were associated with her. It's when Black Wolf took one of the four roses that the truth started to unfold. Black Wolf was in for a petty theft charge but Mary Beth Flake was working with him in the laundry room, accused him of raping her. So he was put to death, even though five other inmates swore... He didn't want to hurt us. Black Wolf was driving us towards Siberia to clear his name. The official story was that three guards were killed during a prison riot. Some people hated one of those guards because he developed a friendship with Black Wolf, treated him like a human. Shh, you guys hear that? No, I don't hear anything. Exactly. - Whoa, wait. - It's all right. I got you. I got this. We just solved one of the biggest mysteries ever. All right. All right, nothing there. Okay. All right, think we're good. Now we know. And now we go. Need to see if what we saw got recorded. How's the footage looking? Yeah, we have everything we shot but we're also still within the prison grounds. How the hell did you get this? We're lucky, I guess. No, I mean, how did you even get in? Uh, your guard let us in. I don't think so. The guard that was supposed to escort you last night had an emergency appendectomy. He was in the hospital. I don't know what to tell you, man, Shtog met us right on time and let us in. - Shtog? - Yeah, your guard. We don't have a Shtog here, smart ass. - What? - Shtog, Ian. The ginger dude. His picture's right on your office wall. The men in that picture died in a riot over 80 years ago. Quit messing with me, what's going on here? The official story was that three guards were killed during a prison riot. Some people hated one of those guards because he developed a friendship with Black Wolf, treated him like a human. All right, my friends, we are finally free to go. Hey, Sara, in case you ever see this your device works. But it only turns blue when there's no humans around. Hashtag just saying.
