Unlucky. Perhaps I'm just really unlucky in love. I thought that if you loved, and gave it your all, and acted really stupid, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... ...that would be enough to make you happy. You shameless hussy! When it comes to men, I'm not asking for much. I gotta go! I don't need someone handsome, or ripped. I just want a simple guy. Someone who won't leave me. Stop it! Someone who will prioritize me. Someone I can call "mine". I don't love you. I promised myself that I wouldn't fall for someone... ...until I was sure that the guy was up to par. Since he hasn't turned up yet, I will just be a third wheel to Will and Grace. Their relationship isn't perfect, but Grace is now carrying their third child. Hardworking couple. I will also be a third wheel to Ally and Noah. They still behave like virgins. By the way, they're already engaged. I'm engaged! So, what else do you want to call me? Referee, bridge, an afterthought, thick-skinned, bitter, lonely, weak, green-eyed monster. That's me. And this is how the third wheel rises up... ...against couple friends who always show affection in public. Please don't judge me. We all want the same thing.6 To love and be loved. "The National Third Wheel" Rise and shine. It's a good day to be alive. I don't want to go to work. You speak as if you're the one whose heart got broken. Don't give in to laziness. It will be difficult for an office not to have a receptionist. Come on, get up. You're going to be late again. Five minutes. Five minutes Pops, just five more minutes. Get up. You're so noisy! Your art is like you, so cute! What's this? "The early bird catches all the insects." I don't get this. Pops, what's this? "The early bird catches all the insects." What? If you wake up early, you'll get more blessings. Or you could have more bad luck! "So what if we're unlucky?" "You can just sleep on it, and plant the next day." -This doesn't make any sense. -Don't contradict it. You're always on the negative side. For as long as we're alive, there is hope. Take risks every day! Hold on, before you leave... I told you. You're getting old and becoming forgetful. Health is wealth. -Fine. -There! That's how you make a quote of the day. New neighbors! They're probably newlyweds, or they just started living together. Hon, I hope our baby grows up looking like me. Trina! Ma'am, you startled me! Have you sent the contract to PCO? Oh, that's right. Here it is. I was going to call them. This won't take long, I promise. That was due days ago. I don't understand why the client is calling me to follow up the contract. That's not even my job. I'm the creative director of this company, for Christâ€™s sake. Tom, Jerry conference room, now. Miss, I want to submit my resume. Please. Pause. Wait, this guy is so handsome. Good thing I took a bath today, Trina. Okay. Play. We don't have any openings. May I submit this for filing? In case there will be an opening in the future. There are no openings here. I prepared for that. Come on baby, just leave her be. Where are you going? Maddie! We quit. Yes, we quit! -You're quitting? -Yes! Tears of joy! Good. Thank you! Let's go. So... ...you want a piece of me? Hey! Miss, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. Are you blind? It's you. I could say the same thing. What are you doing there anyway? Well, it's because... It's because my house is just over there. That's why I'm here. Wait, that's your house? Small world. But if that's your house, why were you walking towards this side? Well, you see... 'Cause you don't have a shirt on. You're not allowed to go shirtless in this subdivision. Are my abs doing anything wrong to you? They're attracting attention. So you like what you see? Yes... I mean, no. I don't want that. If you don't like it, why are you still here? One of these days, I'm going to get you! Remember that! Don't be so cocky! You're welcome. Maddie. I think it's time to hire a new copy writer and art director. We're about to start working on a new account. Okay. Thank you, Dianne. You're welcome. Trina. You're an advertising graduate, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. Will and Grace told me the idea they pitched to me came from you. The family that raise together, stays together. The "raise" thing? I told them that was a bad idea, and that they shouldn't have pitched it to you. -Yeah, it was a bad idea. -Yeah, I know. But somehow it was right because the client approved it. Do I get a commission? Do you want to be a copywriter here in MOMA? I'll think about it. -Okay. -Okay. Yes, ma'am? I need an answer. I said I'll think about it. I heard you. Why? How long does it take for your brain to process this? A week? A month? A year? I need an answer now. All right. I'm going to apply. Thank you for the opportunity. Good. Oh, right. Time to go home. Trina. Yes, ma'am. You can start now. Now? Urgent hiring? Tomorrow's fine. This day is over. And Trina please, don't make me regret hiring you. I won't. I'm done with being cautious. We have to take this into a different level. Goodbye, receptionist. Hello, advertising world. Good morning! Trina Lagdameo. MOMA. Copywriter. Now that you're a copywriter, you just had to change your image. Creatives, This is Napoleon Castillo. You can call him Neo. Hi. You? You know each other? Good. He will be your new partner. Your art director. Ma'am, are you really hiring him? Is there a problem, Trina? No, not really. It's just that... Shut up. We all know the drill. We need a new campaign introducing this new product. As you can see, we will be launching Twinnies! Trina. Hey, Trina. -When are we going to brainstorm? -What? When are we going to brainstorm? It is similar to what we have in the market now. But, of course, this is better. We don't need to brainstorm. Let's see... I already have a lot of concepts. I'll just give everything to you once I'm done. We need to convince people that even if the flavors are weird, but combined together, they're delicious! You are just insecure because my ideas are good. The client's main target is to earn, to sell. If people know the product, if it's familiar to them, they will be more inclined to buy it. It's that simple. The package comes in two different flavors, but can definitely work together. Salted caramel and sweet cheese? Yuck. Don't close your doors. Who knows? You might like it, after all. Best of both worlds, Twinnies! Basically, an alien falls in love with a female human being. Out of this world. No. Twinnies, it takes two? No. Twinnies, twintacular! No. Twinsilicious! No! Twinnies, the twins of fate? Double trouble. 2 become 1. No! Trina! I swear, if you're going to pitch again something that wasn't from you and Neo, might as well I will get a new copywriter! Because everything you're pitching for me right now are amateur work! Get out! Have you ever wished that the earth would just swallow you? That's how I felt. For our creative juices. Now according to research, drinking helps with our creativity... ...while, of course, coffee helps us to stay awake. So let's have beer first, and when we came up with a concept, coffee afterwards. That's if you don't get a heart attack. Sorry, I don't drink when I'm working. Okay. I guess more for me. You're constipated? Trina, we don't really need to be friends. But I want to do well on my first MOMA account. Look, I'm trying here. I'm also constipated. I'm scared of injections, and the sight of blood. I'm just thinking of how we can present in an interesting and exciting way... ...these two things that are so different but work well together. The campaign should be good. I don't know why but I think of my parents. They're just so different... ...but they complement each other at the same time. And they've been inseparable ever since. You just can't explain why two things work together. They can't just magically click. There's got to be a reason. Well, we can play around with 1 + 1 = 2, because... Because two heads are better than one, right? Just like us. Like us? Yeah. I mean... It's better when you have someone with whom you can exchange ideas. Whatever. Just saying. I'm ready. We are destined to meet someone in our life... ...so that we're not alone in our journey. This is a story about two very different people... ...who have a good relationship. This is called meant to be. Before you say that you've heard this before, Neo and I think this is good. It's in line with their strategy. Congratulations, Trina and Neo! Maddie approved the campaign! Thank you. -Trina... -What? I told you so. You should have been a copywriter a long time ago. Why do you keep dancing? If you're not careful, you might give birth before the baby's due. -If you suddenly give birth... -It's none of your business! If it weren't for Trina, the campaign wouldn't have been approved. What? Come on. I couldn't have done it on my own. If you didn't research, we wouldn't have succeeded. I admit... ...I like him. But is he the one? Should I dare to hope again? He stayed overnight, yet nothing happened? -Is that possible? -That's impossible! -Why is it impossible? -In our world today, that's not possible. I'm not like you guys. He did eat the food that I prepared for him though. He ate your cooked food? Did he like your "food"? Wait a minute. Come on, Trina. I know you. Did you kiss? Admit it. You're so talkative. It's so hot here. -You don't have air condition? -Neo, what are you doing? Please, please. Don't do that, Pops might see you. Was it hard or soft? His lips are reddish? What kind of a kiss was it? A spur-of-the-moment kiss, a this-is-nothing kiss... I'm not doing this. -A hopeful kiss. -No. A kiss we can't label, or a kiss with malicious intent? Oh, I like that one! The kiss with malicious intent. Obviously. Just look at that. Nothing happened, okay? All right. If you didn't kiss, what happened? -They held hands. -Just give us something. What? They can't just hold hands! Nothing happened. How many times do I need to tell you? Nothing happened, okay? You're so annoying! Why wonâ€™t you just tell us? Trina, you're so obvious. Guys... Speaking of the devil. -Hi. Hey! What's up? -Hi. We're not talking about you. Trina, can we talk? In private. Trina! Pops. Nice to meet you, Pops. This is Neo. He's my partner...my office partner. Promise me that you'll take care of my daughter. Promise me, or else I will kill you. -Pops. -Did you hear me? Even your family will suffer. I guarantee that, Neo. Neo? You can talk to her here. We're going to hear about it anyway, -so you might as well talk here. -I agree. Take a seat. Guys, maybe it's a secret. If it is, we need to leave them alone for a while. No, it's okay. Yes, it's okay. We can keep secrets. Yes. Come and sit! We can keep a secret, promise. Trina, I just wanna... I just wanna thank you for last night. Don't mention it. "You're very drunk last night!" I want to invite you to have dinner with me tomorrow. Yes. Not you. He meant Trina. You're already pregnant. Yes, you can continue with the question. Trina, answer. Like... ...like a date? Something like that. Like a date? Okay. Eventually, your cheeks will betray you. Okay, 7 PM? Yes, she will be there by 5 PM. We know this girl so well. She's always early. The good thing about having hope is, it gives you a chance to try loving again. Even though you don't know where it will take you. I hope this is it. This is beautiful. You did this? What? This. Dating. This is too much. Does this mean you like me? Isn't it obvious? If it were, then I wouldn't be asking. You just want to hear it from me, right? Of course! I will record it so that you can't back out anymore. How many men have brought you pain... ...for you to build a high wall around you? Three? -Three? -Yes. Same with me. You've also hurt three women? I have loved three women. What are you doing? I'm smashing the wall. See the wall? Okay, are there more walls? A lot. It's the Great Wall of China. Like the Great Wall of China? Okay. Game. I'm up for it. Cheers. Cheers. Pause. Did he said he's game? Okay, game. Don't be green-minded. This is wholesome. Play. I don't kiss on the first date. Me too. Look, Trina, I want things slowly but surely. Trina... I just want you to know... Good morning, work place. Good morning, friends. Hi... What's up with you? What? Nothing. Did anything change? -You seem happy. -There's something. Well, I do have news. I am no longer a third wheel. I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. All right. Let's go! I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. By the way, I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. Baby! I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. I'm not a third wheel anymore. Feel it! I am, baby! Hey. Hi, have you seen this? I was just checking what it is. Okay. Trina, this is Murphy. Oh, you brought a kid? It's Murphy, right? Hi Murphy! Is he your brother? This is my son. Hi, Auntie Trina. My son... Why didn't you tell me right away that you come with a catch? My son is not a catch. He is to me. Trina! I wish you told me about this in the beginning. I didn't know this was going to be an issue. It is an issue for me. What now? I'm going to become his mom? The kid has a mom. So you don't want to do this anymore? Trina... Hey, I'm sorry. I should have told you right away. Maybe this weekend. We can have lunch together with Murphy. I think you guys could get along. Please. It's not easy when you're taken by surprise. Can you blame me? I only want what's simple. Maybe life is just like that, you can't always get what you want. Finish that. You act as if you're only 16. Don't forget how old you are! You are overreacting. I just got dizzy from the heat. You shouldn't tire yourself out. I'm just taking care of your mom's orchids so that when she comes back, she will be pleased with me. Don't get your hopes up. You're so stubborn. Why are you so negative at this early hour? It's Neo. Are you a couple? I want out. And why is that? I didn't remain single for this long just to become a step mom. Oh, he has a kid. Is he married? Are you a mistress again? He's not married. Neo's single. Yes. So, there's no problem. You complain too much, even when things are going your way. Don't get ahead of yourself. You have a chance to be loved. Life is too short for you not to try. In an instant, you may lose everything. Is that what you want? I want you to speak in English again. You have a chance... You're a riot, Pops. Life is too short for you not to try. In an instant... What did I say next? I get it. I may lose everything. Is that what you want? Of course not. That's why I'm here, trying. Testing the waters. Will Murphy like me? I'm a pretty good godmother to Will and Grace's kid. I'm good with children. I'm... I'm... good. I'm good... right? Hi. Come in. Let's go! Are you okay? Neo, I feel like I have to poop. Don't laugh. It hurts. Do you want to poop first? I'm not kidding. Don't make fun of me. -Really? -Yeah! Do you want to take a crap first? No. Murphy. Hello. Murph, you remember Aunt Trina, right? Yes, Daddy. Hi Murphy! This is for you. Let's open it up. Let's see. Wow! Nice. Aunt, I read this already. A few times, actually. Surprise! I got that because it's your favorite. Hey, what do you say? Thank you. -You're welcome. -Dad, can you come to my oral recitation in class? You're welcome, Trina. Thank you. -Can you come? -Oh, yeah? About what? Secret. But promise you will come. Murph, I wouldn't miss it. I promise. When is it? -I'll check. -Neo, where's the bathroom? But promise you'll be there. Mommy! -Mommy! -Hi. I'm shocked. Monica, what are you doing here? Well, Murphy invited me here. He said you were going to introduce someone to me. You must be Trina, right? I'm Monica. I've heard so many good things about you from Murphy. Really? Yes. Neo, is it okay that I'm here right now? I just want to meet Murph's potential step mom. Imagination Trina. Aunt Trina, did you fart? It stinks. Murphy, don't say that. I think my fart came with something extra. Trina here, she's a copywriter. She's really good. We bagged an account because she had this great idea... ...for the campaign for Twinnies. Can you do that? Congratulations! I think you and I will get along. You know what they say, great minds think alike. Really? Excuse me. Aunt Trina, did you know my mom is a chef? She even studied in Paris. And now a top hotel chain is getting her... ...to manage their fine dining kitchen. It's good that you're leaving. I mean... What I meant to say was... Congrats! Congrats! -That's what I wanted to say, congrats. -Thanks. So, what's the setup? Yeah. Murphy's with me during weekends. But Monica and I agreed... ...that once she pursues her dreams as a chef in Canada, she will leave Murphy with me. Just so you know Trina, Neo's just starting to make up for his shortcomings as a father. He was out of the picture... ...and I raised Murphy alone. While he was enjoying too much. Okay, you're perfect. Dad, I got 10 stars this week. And I got perfect scores in all of our quizzes. Thanks to Mom, she's also my tutor. Wow, perfect! You did a good job, too! Aunt Trina, do you know that my mom can speak five languages? English, Tagalog, Spanish, French and Japanese. -Wow. -Murphy, stop. Aunt Trina, why won't you try Mom's Kare-Kare? Let's eat. -Murphy, are you okay? -Are you okay? Pause. Okay, keep calm. Breathe in, breathe out. I'm good with children. I'm good with children. I'm good with children. Play. Trina, I'm sorry. Sorry. Murph, are you sure you're okay? It's not Murphy's fault. He already said sorry. It was an accident. Accident. Yes, an accident. Pops. I was calling out for you. Why are you drinking alone? Why didn't you invite me? Are you okay? Saying sorry is not enough to correct a mistake. Or... ...you will only realize how much you love a person... ...when she is no longer around. That is so true. -Pops. -So very true. That's enough. I'm not used to this. You're becoming a dramatic actor. But dramas are not allowed here. We all know this. This is your mom's fault. Why? She's asking for an annulment, so stupid. Mary, wait. Mary! I'm sorry, Mary. Even though Pops is saying that it was an accident, that doesn't change the fact that he cheated. Are you coming? Does she think I'm a fool? No. I won't allow it. I know... ...she is just using this for revenge. But... ...she still loves me. I miss your mother so much. I want her to come back. But why doesn't she want to? Neo! Trina! This is not what I approved. What's this? And this? What is this? Why did you put the tagline on the headline? Shouldn't it be down here? What? Is it because you haven't thought about what to add? Is that why you did this? What kind of a storyboard is this? Why haven't you finalized this up to now? I may have approved this campaign... ...but all your supporting collaterals are below average! Get some work done! All you do here is flirt with one another! Will, Grace, Ally, Noah! Conference room. We'll divide work on the Twinnies because we're running out of time. Now! Surprise Daddy! -I'm okay now. You can go now. -Murphy. Hey, what are you doing here? I told the driver that I wanted to surprise you. Murph, this is bad timing. Daddy has to attend a meeting. But all right, you can come with us. Just stay in the corner, okay? Don't make any noise. Neo... What's that kid doing here? Maddie, I'm sorry. This is my son. Neo, working hours. Okay, everyone. The Twinnies campaign... I'll take care of this. You can go ahead. Murphy, your dad has to work for a while. In the meantime, come with me. Is that okay? Ali and Noah, you handle digital. Here, sit down. Let's see... I have a drawing pad that you can use. I also have a pencil here, and coloring materials. Sorry, I don't have crayons. Stay here while Daddy's working, and we will be back before you know it. Thank you, Aunt Trina. Think of a concept on how we can reach more viewers. You're welcome. Thank you. So, do you think I can be a mommy? That's all for now, okay? I'll follow up on that. Yes, ma'am. Look, Daddy! Me, you and Mom. Murph... What did you do? What's all this mess? What's all this mess? Tell me! Hey! What did you do with my art card? Please, let me handle this, okay? Aunt Trina told me to draw. So, I needed a lot of materials. Murph, I said you may draw. I didn't tell you to turn our office into a dumpsite. I'm sorry, I'll clean it all up. Murphy. -Murphy, don't cry. -It's all right. It's okay. Never mind the mess, your drawing looks great. Right, guys? It looks good. Guys, doesn't it look great? Great... Do you need help getting back at him? Our kids can take that little creep. I'm telling you, they can take him! -My children are well trained. -Hey, come on. Am I making a mistake? There's nothing wrong with what you're doing. -Are you happy with Neo? -I guess? Do you accept the circumstances in Neo's life? -Perhaps? -Perhaps? You're in a relationship with Neo. There shouldn't be any maybes or perhaps. Those are unacceptable. You have to be certain. If you are, then facing difficulties will be easier. Because you have accepted and you're sure this is what you want. Think about it. Neo, I think your son doesn't like me. Trina, I'm scared of making a mistake with Murphy. Monica may decide anytime to take him away, for good! Why would Monica do that to you? When we had Murphy... ...I wasn't ready to be a dad. Monica knew that. So she dumped me for another guy. I was so mad. I just left them. And Monica... She had to give up her dreams... ...to become a single parent. After some time, I realized that... ...I want something permanent. Trina, I need your help. I know this can be too much for you to handle. But I need you to try. Please. I've got an idea! Why don't we go out of town? Just the three of us? What? Yeah. Wouldn't it be best for you guys to get to know each other better? Please. Okay. Thank you. I could say that I don't want to go. But nothing can dictate who I will love. Like Pops said, take risks. So this is me, standing in front of a boy, making a promise to try. Actually no, I'm not only going to try. I'm going to do it! Hi ma'am, sir, good morning! -Hi. Good morning. -Let me help you, sir. -All right. Thanks. -Welcome, sir. Daddy, I want to see the pool! Come on, let's go. -Murph, we have to check in first. -Come on, Dad! -Come on, let's go! -Is that okay with you? It's okay. -I can take care of checking us in. -Come on, Dad. Wait. Murph, Murph. Wait. One second, okay? Wait. Murph, do you want to swim? I can take you, but I have to unpack first. Okay, let's eat by the pool. Okay. Come on. Let's eat later! He's really happy. You're no longer in love with Monica, right? What kind of a question is that? It's nothing. Just making sure. You're the one I love. Murph. Where's Murph? Murphy! -Murphy! -Murph! I'm not proud of this moment. Especially when I saw the fear in Neo's eyes. I had no one to blame but myself. Miss, can you please inform the staff that there's a missing child? Please wait for a while, ma'am. Neo, relax. We're going to find Murphy. Miss, please let me know when you find the missing child. Murphy. Murphy! Hey! Neo. Wait. Why did you leave the pool without my permission? Do you realize how worried we were? You just disappeared. Dad, you were talking to Aunt Trina. You should have told me that you wanted to ride the train. Neo, enough with that. You shouldn't go anywhere without my permission. Neo, that's enough. That's enough. Aunt? Yes? Are you going to take my dad away? No. No, I am not going to do that. Murph, do you love your dad? Yes. I'm going to tell you something. Can we keep this a secret, just between the two of us? I love your dad too. Since we both love your dad, I hope we can be friends. It will make your dad so happy. I want to see your dad happy. What about you? Yes. Aunt, can you come to my recital in school? Sure, okay. I'll be there. I promise. Mom, please call Dad. Is Dad answering, Mom? Baby, not yet. You have to sit down. Help! Everyone here help. Nurse... Grace, are you okay? -I'm okay. -I'm sorry I have to leave you now. -I just need to go to my son. Okay? -Okay, thanks. Please, help us! Help us! Trina... Trina... Trina! I told you that the sight of blood scares me. Thank you. Next, Murphy Castillo. You can do this! We've practiced this, right? Go! Because of me, we weren't able to fulfill our promise to Murphy. I felt so bad. Why do these things happen? I'm doing everything to make our relationship work, yet something always goes wrong. Is Murphy already asleep? You know, Neo, it's not you who had difficulty explaining to our son... ...why you weren't around today. You didn't see how hurt he was from being so disappointed in you. Neo, I have never interfered with whoever you want to be with. But we promised each other that Murphy is our priority. I thought you had changed. Can you do it? Can you be a dad first? Monica, I'm doing the best I can. The best you can? Losing your son at the resort is your best? Yes, your son told me. You didn't even come to his recital. -Monica, it's not Neo's fault. -Trina... Our officemate gave birth, so... Do you actually think I care? Do you think Murphy would understand? You will never get where I'm coming from because you're not a mother! Monica stop it! Stop fighting! Go away! Murphy. Murphy. I'm so sorry. Murphy, I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you. -I'm really very sorry. -Murphy, go to your room. Murphy. Murphy, I'm sorry. Neo, if you'll just make Murphy your last priority, I might as well bring him to Canada with me. You can't take my son away from me. Yes I can, Neo. Remember, you were just on borrowed time. Monica, it was just one mistake. One mistake. That's not just one mistake. You asked for a chance and I gave it to you. Thinking that you'd focus on Murphy, but you didn't. You just wanted to have a good time. You know what scares me? That is the same reason why you left us, why you left Murphy. You were prioritizing yourself. Let me know when you are ready to be a father. You can leave now. Let's go. We should... We should have what? I shouldn't have accompanied Grace, and just let you go on your own? What? Neo, maybe we shouldn't be together. Sometimes, we say things we don't mean. But since they've already been said, we feel committed to those words. -Murphy! -My dad's gonna pick me up... -Murphy! -...so I have to go, bye! Murphy, hi. Can we talk? Murphy. Murphy, I'm sorry. Murphy. Your daddy loves you very much. I just want a happy family, Aunt Trina. No matter how much you tell yourself that you can handle it, there are things that you shouldn't force. I'm going to go now. But if it's okay with you, I'll be back tomorrow. Neo, have a seat. I need to talk to you. About what? Neo, I admit. I thought we still had a chance. I want our family to be whole again. I envy Trina. Just because... ...she should have been me. I should benefit from the change in you. But I am a mother first. So I have decided... ...to bring Murphy to Canada. I don't think I can trust you with Murphy, not yet anyway. Neo, I hope you understand, but... I need to be selfish right now for Murphy's well-being. What about me? Monica, I need my son. I love my son. I decided to go with them to Canada... ...for Murphy. Trina, I'm just going to take care of this, okay? And then I'll come back for you. In the short time that we've known each other... ...and that we've been together, I want to thank you... ...for making me feel what it's like to be happy. Thank you, because I know that Murphy will always be your top priority. Even though I will always come in second, I always feel that you are taking my feelings into consideration. I think I'll be okay... ...as long as we're together. I'm okay, as long as you are around. It's a shame. Maybe it's just bad timing. When will it be? When is the right time for us? But you know what, Neo? Look at me. I am so proud of you. I am proud of you for being a good father. This is right. You made the right decision. I would prefer a man who would choose his child over me. But it is better to love when nothing's on your way. "Quote of The Day Pops loves Trina" Pops. It's going to be okay. Unlucky. I really am unlucky in love. You thought he was yours, then he's taken away. You wish you never had him, so that it wouldn't hurt as much. How do I move on? Be busy at work. Go to parties. Drink. Go out with friends. Cry. Become bitter. Laugh. Cry again. But no matter what I do, I always come back to him, and to when we started. Rise and shine! Pops, I am not going to work. Pause. How do I look? Just like Basha. Isn't that what heartbroken people do? It's part of moving on. Play. What if you get fired? Good. You can't always be like this. What should I do? It's so hard to move on. You know that, right? Do you still love him? Very much. Then fight for him. Pops, come on. He's not even here. That's enough. You're just badgering me. So follow him to Canada. You're so funny. Nice joke! Hilarious. I'm not kidding. Don't let go of the love that you know is meant for you. Wait, hold on. What? Maybe you should apply for a visa first. I thought I should leave right away. Goodbye Manila. Hello, Canada. I think I'll be fine here in Canada. At least, I will be here with Neo. Now I can see our future. I can take care of Murphy, while Neo's at work. Bring him to school, that sort of thing. From time to time, I will go home to Manila for Pops. Let fate take care of the rest. The important thing is, I'm here. Murph, Neo let's eat. Wow. This is your favorite, right? Take your seat. It looks delicious. Murphy, how's school? It's fine, Mom. I have a new knock-knock joke. -Knock knock. -Who's there? -Corny. -Corny who? Corny, corny, corny. Corny, corny, corny. You're so corny, Murphy. Just like Neo. Dad, let's go downtown. Can you join us, Mom? It's your lucky day. I don't have work tomorrow. -Knock, knock. -Who's there? Hello. Hello, how's my daughter? Were you able to fight for him? Are you with Neo? -Didn't I tell you... -Pops, stop it. Why? What happened? I am such a fool. We shouldn't fight for people who aren't with us anymore. You made me hope. Why did you make me hope? I've accepted that he's gone. Gone. You know what the problem is? You never give up. You can give up. Stop deluding yourself that Mommy will come back to you. She is never coming back. They're not coming back so you have to move on. I'm going to move on, too. Let's end this. I'm just getting hurt because of you. You can still do this. -What have you done? -Enough. This is enough. I give up. Pause. Sorry Pops, I fought with you. It's true. Regret always comes at the end. I didn't mean to get mad at you. I'm sorry. I wish I were as strong as you. I wish you had waited for me. I didn't expect that by the time I came back, everything was gone in the blink of an eye. Your father had a heart attack. Pause. Pause. Pause. I want to pause. I want to rewind. I want to skip or fast forward. But life isn't like that. When we last spoke, I had a fight with Pops. He said that when you love someone, you have to fight for him. I replied, how will you fight for someone who is no longer with you. And even if they are no longer with you, they can still hurt you. Even until now. The pain then was nothing compared to the pain I am feeling right now. I would rather be fooled... ...or dumped again and again... ...than to lose my best friend. Pops was my true love. He's the man who loved with all his heart... ...and never asked for anything in return. You should have seen the way he gave hugs... ...they way he gives kisses. He was liberal with his apologies. And he repeatedly told me that he loved me. I, on the other hand, can be quite stingy with that. I should have said it more often. I wish I said it to you more often, Pops. Pops. What's going to happen to me now, Pops? Now, when whys will be left unanswered. Now, when I can't forget. Now, when all I can cling to is a wish. I'm sorry for your loss. What are you doing here? I came to extend my sympathies. You shouldn't have come. Neo, I went to Canada. I saw you and your family, you all looked happy. And that's just right. Just go back to them. Your family needs you. You being here is not helping with the pain that I'm feeling right now. In fact, you're making it worse. You really are one of a kind, Pops. I can still feel your love even though you're not around. I can hear your voice. Most likely, you're going to tell me... ...that when you lose someone, someone else takes his place. Some come back, some continue to love. "Quote of The Day Always choose to love" When are you leaving? I'm staying here. Monica and I have settled our differences. And we both agreed that we're gonna be better parents for Murphy. We know better now. Murphy has a better understanding of our set-up as well. When school's out, he will come here. And I can visit him anytime I want. Trina... ...can you please come with me? I need to do something important. Maybe this is why there are no pause and stop buttons in real life... ...so that no chance will be wasted. A chance to heal. A chance to forgive. A chance to continue our journey. I remember when I first met Pops. He made me make a promise. But I fell asleep. But I'm here now. And I am making a promise to take care of you. Trina, I promise I will always be here if you need a shoulder to cry on. I promise to be here whenever you're ready. I'm not going anywhere. I promise that I'll never leave you. I never knew how much you really loved me until you let me go. But that's when I knew, you're the one for me. Because I knew how much pain you were willing to take... ...just to see me happy. I hope it's not too late. Neo, it's not that easy. Well, maybe we can start again. Lucky. I need to believe that I am lucky in love. It's quite rare to have the chance to begin again, and even more rare that you still love each other. I'm willing to be a third wheel again. What's important is, I choose to love again. There's nothing wrong with being a third wheel, as long as you're not a mistress. A third wheel is just waiting. Waiting for the one meant for her. So third wheels, don't let go. He's just around, waiting for you. Waiting for the right time for you to find each other. I found the one for me... Hi. ...and I am never letting go. Hey.
