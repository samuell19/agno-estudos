(Multicom Jingle) (anxious violin, piano music) (speaking foreign language) (dial tone beeping) - These teenagers were kidnapped and the kidnapping was carried out by Hamas members. Israel will act in all ways under our control to bring home the three kidnapped teenagers. - Israeli troops tonight are searching the West Bank for three kidnapped teenagers. - [Newsman] Troops arrested around 80 Palestinian suspects in and around the West Bank city of Hebron. - God willing, we'll all be able to celebrate their return safely. - [Newsman] Thousands of Jewish worshipers gathered at Jerusalem's Western Wall in a special mass prayer. (speaking foreign language) - [Supporters] We stand with you, we stand with you. (chanting in foreign language) (anxious violin music) - [Newswoman] The search for the three Israeli teenagers ended tragically when soldiers discovered their bodies buried underneath a pile of stones in a field in a valley northwest of Hebron. - At this hour, the funeral processions for Naftali Fraenkel, Gil-ad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah are getting underway. (speaking foreign language) - A day later, July 2nd, a 17 year old Palestinian teen is abducted while heading to a mosque. - His body was dumped in this forest just outside Jerusalem. He was still alive when the killers doused him in gasoline and set him on fire. (rockets booming) - Israeli called up 1500 reservists and Palestinian militants fired dozens of rockets into Israel. - We are beyond that point now. Hamas are going to pay for the attacks they're carrying out. (speaking foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) - [Newswoman] From France to The Netherlands and to Germany, a surge of anti-Semitism is spreading across Europe sparked by the Israel-Hamas war. - [Protesters] Adolf Hitler, Adolf Hitler! (rockets booming) (sirens warbling) - [Newswoman] What began with the death of three young teens, now a full out war. (anxious violin tones) (relaxed guitar music) (singing in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (relaxed rock music) (audience cheering) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - Here. Naftali and Ada. Ada who you just saw here and this is from his Bar Mitzvah session. Here he is playing flutes with Kevin. - [Racheli] Our second son Naftali was born the week we moved to Nof Ayalon. - He did all the things a teenager does, which means he did a lot of fighting. So fighting with his sisters and he didn't always like to study too much. - And he knew how to do it very well. - But when he needed to do it, he did it very well. When he was younger, he had a teacher and he learned to play flute and a little bit of guitar, a little bit but then he decided he wants to really go into it and he taught himself. - He had this little MP3 player and he filled it up with classical music, jazz, pop, rock, Hasidic music, older (speaking foreign language), old Israel music and it was a conscious decision to expose himself to every style of music that he can and to develop an ear for it. I remember I was about to download for him some Alan Parsons Project, you know? These are old time things that I love and I said Naftali will appreciate it and I didn't make it. Naftali usually didn't travel at night but that evening, he was back from a field trip and it was the last day of school and he texted us at some point that he's on his way home. We still have the text only an hour later and we said "Great." (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - There were policemen banging on our door trying to wake us up because Gil-ad's family were in touch with him and they realized that his phone was suddenly off and that he didn't show up. They got to us to check if Gil-ad is sleeping by us. So for a second there, we thought it's all about going up to his room, seeing both of them safe in their bed, maybe saying "Next time you have to tell your parents." The beds were empty. We ran down to the basement, they weren't there. We immediately knew we're in deep trouble. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - In the morning, like right after the police went, this was like a couple hours later, Ofir, Gil-ad's father and Avi, they never knew each other before, were already on their way together to-- - Gush Etzion. - To Gush Etzion to see what they can figure out. They spent a couple of hours very intensively together and later we learned that Eyal was also missing. (speaking foreign language) - Hamas were desperate to mount some operations in the West Bank and ignite some riots, trouble, confrontations all over the West Bank. They felt caged in the Gaza Strip and they were contemplating different ways to revive their networks in the West Bank. Hamas has a special command in Turkey which is responsible for the West Bank. It's headed by a certain fellow by the name of Saleh al-Arouri, a very serious player within Hamas leadership parties and he has a group with him and they, with the knowledge of the Turkish authorities, they were concentrating on the effort to revive Hamas activities in the West Bank. How do they do that? They operate through a team in Gaza which is unofficially named the West Bank Command. The kidnapping of the three teenagers was a part of that effort and was carried out by two Hamas activists from Hebron. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - I spent that Friday contacting my kids. We called our oldest son to come home and our parents to spend the Shabbat with us. - A very hard Shabbat, it's not easy at all. But we tried and I think the seeds of the way we live today started then. The way we behaved then on that Shabbat. (speaking foreign language) - We've just met for the first time, the families of Ayel, Gil-ad and and Naftali. It was a very emotional meeting, very significant. We met good, strong, God-fearing people and we're trying from here to send strength to everybody that's involved in this effort. To the soldiers, to the government, to the Prime Minister that's in touch with us, we pray that everybody involved, the soldiers and our children will come home harmless. - [Newsman] For five days now, Israeli forces have conducted an intensive manhunt for the three teenagers who disappeared Thursday night. Part of a search that has so far yielded little. (speaking foreign language) - Mr. President, it is wrong to take children, innocent boys and girls and use them as instruments of any struggle, it is cruel. This Council is charged with protecting human rights. I wish to ask, doesn't every child have the right to come home safely from school? We just want them back in our homes, in their beds. We just want to hug them again. Thank you, Mr. President. (crowd cheering) (speaking foreign language) (crowd applauding) (speaking foreign language) - There was such solidarity and love and such positive feelings in the air and a basic human sense of we're all together here and we are wanting to get the children back. - They told us two bodies were found. A half an hour later, they said three bodies were found. They didn't have positive identification 'til the middle of the night but they said it's them. In a way, we were prepared because we had 18 days to think about it. It's not as if you sit at home and suddenly someone comes and says "Your son died in a car accident." That's, maybe we didn't want to think of it but it was there. In a way, it makes it easier but it's devastating. (speaking foreign language) - We had some ceremony in Nof Ayalon. That was only for Naftali. (speaking foreign language) And each one of the families had its own ceremony in their house, in their environment. And then we all met in Modiin and there we had that big funeral with the President and the Prime Minister. (speaking foreign language) - [Newsman] A day after Israel buried three students abducted near a Jewish settlement, Israeli police have found the body of a fourth teenager in Jerusalem Forest. - [Reporter] Mohammed was killed in revenge for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers last month. - The Shabak, the Israeli Security Agency detained this morning several Israeli Jewish suspects. - We spoke with one of the suspect's lawyers. He told us that three among them are teenagers themselves. (speaking foreign language) Everybody we knew was horrified by the story and we felt this is something we must do. We also tried to meet his family, they chose not to meet us. Going through that horror ourselves and realizing that somebody else was hurt like that was horrifying. - [Translator] The story that we know is that they died in a traffic accident. These soldiers weren't killed and died in a car accident in Eilat and then they were buried in Hebron. They wanted to bomb Gaza and wanted to do any operation, to use it as a justification. - The grief and outrage over these murders tonight in Israel is extraordinary. - [Newswoman] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held Palestinian faction Hamas responsible. - Hamas leaders are warning if Israeli authorities attempt to expel Hamas leaders from the West Bank, there will be consequences. - [Newswoman] Dozens of militant rockets have been fired at Israel today. - [Reporter] Tonight airstrikes are being reported in Gaza. - [Newswoman] More than 30 airstrikes were launched on Hamas. - [Reporter] On Tuesday, the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip illuminated by the flames of war. Israel may launch a ground invasion if the rocket attacks continue. - [Newswoman] At least 200 rockets have been fired at Israel. - The ground operation began around 10:00 p.m. on Thursday local time. (gunfire clacking) (chanting in foreign language) (tense violin music) - Suddenly it's as if Israel decided one morning to attack its defenseless neighbors because well, we haven't hit Gaza for a few years. That's the crudeness of the image that gets repeated over and over again. In one sense, it's understandable that the world will see the Palestinians as David and Israel as Goliath but if you widen the lens to include the Arab world and large parts of the Muslim world, then Israel becomes David and our enemies are Goliath. When we look around our borders, what we see is Hezbollah in the north and Iran right behind them. We have the Islamic State on the Golan, Hamas is Gaza, we have Al-Qaeda in Sinai and so when we look at our situation, we don't see mighty Israel, we don't experience ourselves as mighty Israel. But the images that are conveyed from these asymmetrical conflicts reinforce a distorted image and we're not able to convey the sense of vulnerability that Israelis live with every day. (chanting in foreign language) - [Newsman] Protests against Israel are increasing taking on a hateful, anti-Semitic tone. - We hear "Death to Jews" in the street from Antwerp to the south of the county. - [Newsman] July recorded the second- highest number of anti-Semitic incidents in 30 years. - This summer's conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas is behind the rise. - We've seen banners held aloft and heard chants proclaiming support for Hitler and saying that Jews should be sent to gas chambers. - [Newsman] And the language has turned from anti-Israel to anti-Jew. (gunfire clacking) - [Reporter] French police stormed a kosher grocery store, freeing many hostages but discovering four more innocent victims in what the French President called an act of anti-Semitism. (explosion booms) - You would have thought that whatever rage consumed people 80, 90, 100 years ago, you would have thought that 70 years ago when it was clear what had happened that that would then have been assuaged. Apparently not. It would appear to be a hunger that cannot be satisfied. The minute I say it, I realize how the danger of exaggeration on my part. I live in London, which is a very peaceful city. I do not, touch wood, fear for my safety as I walk the streets. Though I sometimes wonder if there will be a time when I will fear for safety when I walk the streets. But with each instance of renewed anti-Semitism in Europe or in Australia or indeed in this country, you just do wonder. The pitch on the streets and in the newspapers of Israeli loathing increases until you do actually feel quite frightened by the language as much as anything else. Only last year in Gaza, normally quite reasonable reporters would be interviewing Israeli politicians and asking them why they love killing babies. We have the Baroness Tonge who is a member of the Liberal Democrat party. She is in the House of Lords. She's been savagely anti-Israel for many years. But recently when there was the earthquake in Haiti and some members of the Israeli Defense Forces were sent out to help and they helped and she wrote, "I'm not saying this is the case, "but I have heard it said that the only reason "that they were there was to harvest organs "of dead Haitians and then do whatever they want. "I'm not saying that this happened, "but I think we should look into it." You can say anything you like about Israel because it's not anti-Semitic to be an anti-Zionism, they feel they are free of that imputation. It is not anti-Semitic to be a critic of Israel. I am a critic of Israel. Therefore, I am not an anti-Semite. (gunfire clacking) We are guessing about what the future will hold. Jews have managed to live in the cracks for many hundreds of years, sometimes well, sometimes not so well while anti-Semitism just simmers and bubbles around them. I think to suppose now, if it wasn't got rid of in the Holocaust, such a short time ago, then what will get rid of it? What detergent will we find that can get rid of it? Nothing, so it remains. Then the question of how much of it remains, how virulent and how toxic it is and how far we can just hold it back and that will I'm afraid change from country to country and from age to age. But I don't think any Jew should ever suppose that thing will now ever go away, it will not. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - During the summer, we met quite a few bereaved families and every family has a way of dealing with things but one of the things that we heard people say is "You know, we put a smile on our face and we "continue living but you and I know it's just a mask. "Behind that, it's all devastation." And both Avi and I felt we don't want to live that way. I can feel sorrow, I don't have to become my sorrow. We promised our children that our family will be happy again. My daughter Natmah, she's six years old. She saw me packing something and she said, "Eema, do you still put on your makeup "only when you get to work so you can cry on the way?" And I said "You know Natmah, "I don't cry every day on the way to work "but I reserve the right to cry on the way to work." And it was important for me that she could say something like that, she understands that we need to cry, that we ought to cry but also she sees us laughing and being happy and enjoying ourselves. - [Avi] The grief is not everything. There is a time for grief and a time for crying and there's a time for the life. - [Racheli] And sometimes it's a minute of this and a minute of this. - Right. But it doesn't take over everything. - But even after the summer where supposedly we paid the ultimate price, I don't regret for a day growing up here and being able to raise my children here. The future? Life isn't simple and I don't think there are any simple solutions and I'm not very naive as far as where this dispute is going. We keep our hopes us but we said there's so much blessing in our life, we try to concentrate on that. - And as Racheli mentioned, there are so many good things we were blessed with and that's the things we hold to and continue.
