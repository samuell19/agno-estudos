Matthews said to me didn't you yeah she's funny thing nobody expects to live forever your doctor tells you at the end of the road it's very far ahead could be any time at all just can't believe it not one atom of your body belief well oh you talking about it again I'm sorry that's all right mrs. Dean I'll be careful I should get tired I'll call a cab I would if I were you bye bye [Music] Emily Dean had known these streets for years without really seeing them [Music] now well it seems she might never see them again they were suddenly very dear to her her eyes clung to every familiar detail she began to remember things the small odds of Em's of fifty years of living 50 years [Music] there were milepost along the years of her life pointing like accusing fingers she had long known they were there but it had been easier not to see certain things the things she had left undone and things she had intended to do but never quite got around to she and Ed it didn't seem so long ago that shianet had walked through this park hand-in-hand and sat on that same edge Oh where'd I'm so excited just by this time tomorrow D poor head perhaps she had taken him a little too much for granted these last few years was it so long ago it didn't seem so and so time in reaching for eternity paused for a moment to look back this ring I give thee this ring I give thee in token and pledge in token and pledge of our constant faith of our constant faith and abiding love and abiding love I now pronounce the man and wife in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh and the banks Oh it's a wonderful let's keep it this way always [Music] he doesn't look too bad for my first dinner does it terrific mrs. Dean oh I'm so full of thanks for everything yeah me too saying it's just words we have to do better than that I think we have to live it every single day I'm with you in it's also beautiful I guess a lot of people have the idea that about all of minister does is preach and visit the sick well what else does he do well I try to visit people when they're not sick I often find that people need help and don't know it take take you too for instance you found something wonderful together it's not not just your love or your home something deeper than that it's a quality of life we'd like to keep it cost you it and you can too but it won't be easy I think there are two or three things you need to remember one is don't try to go out alone there are too many forces at work in the world trying to tear down your ideals your sense of values you need the strength that comes from working in the Fellowship of a church second remember that there are three of you and a partnership Edie Emily and God don't forget to talk to that third partner regularly last and I guess if you don't remember anything else I say today and remember this our visit will have been worthwhile if you want to keep that quality of life you've got to share it you can't just live for yourselves alone you've got to work and pray and give not just for people you know but for people whom you don't know whom you'll never see that's one of the functions of the church it can serve as the medium through which you express this well this matter of sharing we both used to be active in church work I think I'd like to be again oh I'd like nothing better than to see you both in church every Sunday morning we'll find lots of work for you to do but first why don't you join the couples club that's a group of young people young married people like yourselves they're active workers in the community trying to make a better community in a better world for that matter there's a meeting this uh this next Friday night can you make it what yes we'd be glad to wouldn't we it thanks for coming over this evening doctor well thank you for letting me come it's been a real pleasure thanks for the cookie I just came home a little early that's all I washed the windows cleaned all the woodwork did the shopping had to bake a cake in the middle of it all for the church and then I shuffle wait a minute wait hold everything look I just came home to tell you something I got a raise hmm five dollars more a week oh oh I know it isn't much but it means they like me down to the bank and maybe someday I'll even get to be an assistant cashier or cashier even I'll get a real raise then what she wrote darling you think you got a real raise when you're president okay you bet your life I will mm-hmm oh why haven't any time for you get away from me we got a hurry many many the cup of club remember oh yeah we've enjoyed getting to know you mr. Saunders and thanks for signing the card well see you in church next Sunday yes indeed mr. Saunders I'm looking forward to meeting mrs. Saunders [Music] oh that's a fine demonstration thank you very much I wonder if you people realize what a great work you're doing calling on new people and inactive members of the church you see some of us are called to the Christian ministry here or as missionaries but most of us are laypeople that means our work is right here another thing as laypeople you have a great many opportunities that aren't even open to me for instance there's a minister I mean the people you live with and work with if they're going to see God they're probably going to have to see him in you you can live so that Christ has a living witness in you wherever you are day or night and what you say and what you do and then what you are dr. Emory when we talk to these people how much emphasis should we put on giving well I'm sure of one thing giving is essential to Christian growth giving is essential to life life is more than just a matter of all intake and no out goal otherwise we've become like the Dead Sea no sir you show me at either a man who gives a tenth and I'll show you a life in which the power of God is at work the person who doesn't give or who gives grudgingly is almost sure to be spiritually anemic this pledge card that's more than just an ordinary pledge card it's more than a request for money it's a passport to a whole new way of life it's a symbol of dedication to Christ and that kind of dedication means change lives and change lives mean a changed community and maybe even a changed world ah now about this card well we feel when you realize how much the church means to you that you want to become active members of it give regularly to its support oh we used to be very active in church work but just like we've been terribly busy you have no idea sure I know how it is but this is important oh it isn't that we aren't interested we are we try to be good Christians but it's just we thought we were Christians too we found it it isn't easy outside the church we need help oh I'm for the church it's a great institution the church is a great institution it's a world institution and if we don't want to have another war we've got to think about the whole world and the people in China and Africa and India and do something to help them find a better way to live now by ourselves we can't do much but through the church we can do a lot if we all pitch in and help well I don't know what we can do right now maybe later on we can help out well what my husband's trying to say is that it isn't that the church needs us it's that we need the church I don't know how to say this very well but it's made a big difference to adding me to put Christ at the center of our lives and and to be with other people who are trying to do the same thing we haven't been married very long we think we've found something and we want to keep it we want others to have it too well anyway we'll let when we see you in church next Sunday if we possibly can yes now well about this card oh let's not decide this tonight Sara you know how things been this year we'll talk it over and see what we can do we'll let you know sure that'll be fine well it's been very nice meeting you good Oh wedding but in spite of discouragement and and Emily plunged wholeheartedly into the life and work of the church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen that guy have any morning to talk to you I could so much about that neighborhood house tell me what kind of work do you do down there oh we serve the people who don't have any other place to get together some of the need food and clothing and jobs but even more than that we try to give them a new spirit in their lives so they can do more for themselves oh well that sounds wonderful mr. Decker I'd give a lot if I could get you and Ed to come down and give us a hand one night a week Oh what could we do we've never done anything like that oh you can help with the games and the crap work lots of things but above everything else you'll be helping by just being there really yes you see if they can just feel that somebody likes them or cares a little bit about their problems they need that like all the rest of us I see with that wonderful yes it is it's really wonderful what you're doing I wish ed and I went so binti with a lot of other things but I don't see how we could take on anything else just now maybe later think about it when Emily we're trying to get Christianity across to these people but words don't mean very much to them but they really understand are things that happen things that they can see well think about it really Emily suppose we didn't have a nice house to give parties in the birth we had to depend on the neighborhood house sounds like you've been talking to Harry Dekker I suddenly have Lazard to turn him down I don't see how we could go down there one night a week way too busy that's what I told him so don't worry about it he'll find somebody to help him out yes I guess so only Rosie doesn't forget it I wish I could but I keep thinking about those people he was talking about we think we're pretty good Christians but maybe we need to put it into practice more mr. Decker says those people don't understand words just there's things that happen things they can see Edie and you know who those people really are no there are our neighbors yeah yeah that's right they are and it would only take one night a week wouldn't it why don't we try it alright let's try it okay she and dad had something in those days something fine why haven't they been able to keep it young lady young lady drop you [Music] Emme away [Music] did you feel oh you bet I saw it what a guy his eyes were open - I got a good look at him they're gonna be just like yours yeah but he's got your nose uh he's as bright as the dollar he's the best-looking one of the bunch - I looked at them all that must be it doesn't happen he's a stand-up anti Richard Richard do you decide on that what in 19 no Richard Elwood Dean after my father oh that's nice Richard Dean day Dickie Dickie Dean Dickie diamond that's good innit do you accept for yourself and for your son the Covenant of God and there in consecrate your son to him I do I and do you promise to instruct him in the principles of our holy religion as contained in the scriptures to pray with him and for him and to bring him up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord I do I do Richard Elwood Dean and so after Emily dedicated a new life and accepted the responsibility that goes with it but he was never anything but Dicky - Adam Emily of course he had become the center of their lives in fact the center of everything sound asleep only time I get any rest are here won't you sit down thank you no Emily we're trying to get a nursery started a day nursery for the children of working mothers I think that's a wonderful idea doctor how'd you like to help you know perhaps one day a week you can take your own baby with you it wouldn't be much different from sitting here oh I'm afraid I have my hands full right now dr. Emory dick he's been off his diet the last few weeks and but since ed took on my work at the bank I've had a lot of extra entertaining - June we even had to give up our work at the neighborhood house yes I know Emily but this is a way for you to help yourself when children come so many mothers narrow their lives down to the horizon of their homes you are to your family to keep your personality growing one way to do that is through service to others you and that have something very fine in your lives Emmeline you must never lose it no no we don't want to nobody does it just happens sometimes I don't know he isn't even paid for yes Oh give me time honey oh wait I eat all so many bills doctor bills hospital bills all the things for the baby and I had to get some clothes for myself hey did you have to join the country club right now well that's business you want me to be president of the bank someday don't you all right I've got to meet the big shots yeah but where you know we haven't kept up our pledge to the church either yeah that's right we'll just have to wait a while I guess [Music] Emily tried to manage the details of living but as sometimes happens the details of living began to manage Emily [Music] you're robbing my good interest that belong to your great-grandmother Elwood until you learn to behave it was a daily round of the butcher the baker the candlestick maker dozens of household frustrations [Music] hello hello a.m. listen honey I just now let me tell you something if you ever leave those shaving materials on that washed and again but I know I M yes the plum has been here all day the waters turned off it I'm going crazy now wait a minute listen I'm trying to tell you something I've got to run up to Chicago this afternoon and testify in a Czech case why don't you come along come along how can I come along who's gonna take care of deke bring deke we can have dinner there catch a train back in the morning you know tomorrow's the day that I'm entertaining those wives of your bank officials how can I go gallivanting off to Chicago I've got to clean the house thoroughly bake a cake it I don't know what I'm gonna get it all done as it is all right all right oh I won't be home for dinner M see you later honey bye bye take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what ye shall drink Oh yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than food and the body than raiment your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things therefore seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you the Sermon on the Mount but it had been easier not to listen too closely to those great words there was a faraway look in her eyes as she looked across toward the pond somewhere she had read that swans sing when they were going to die she thought of it now she didn't feel a bit like singing all she could think of was a line of a prayer she used to say when she was a little girl if I should die before I wake why should children be taught to say things like that now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take god bless mommy and daddy that's right and a-one amen mm-hmm amen that's a good boy to keep Oh [Music] Emma you alright [Music] hey say you'd better go see dr.

Dean except that I love Jimmy very much I see oh come on mom breakdown we've just have to make the best of it I presume Oh Jimmy uh what I think well your mother means perhaps is that well she would have preferred to have a big church wedding you know with all the trimmings but that's just what we didn't want of course it's all right mom wait'll you get acquainted well let's go out in the kitchen and make some coffee come on give me you your mother doesn't like me oh sure she does you just don't know mom yet give her a chance huh I didn't know she was gonna be like that come on snap out of it come on why did you have to give them the deep freeze after all he's our son and he married the girl he loved why do you have to make it so difficult for them I don't even know the girl anything about her family it's just that you're hurt and jealous that's all well of course I resent my son being whisked away from me by that girl listen Emily whether you know it or not you've grown very dictatorial these past few years you drove your son away from home to begin with and you'll never get him back if you go on like this you're so wrapped up in your your home and yourself you can't see anything beyond it how dare you talk that way to me it's about time somebody told you of course we expect you and Jimmy to make your home address you may have the front bedroom upstairs Oh that'll be fine mom Oh more coffee for you my dear No thank you mrs. Dean well Irene we may as well understand each other from the beginning there are certain things that I expect in this household and I must ask you to comply with whatever I may well mother I'm afraid it won't do it for us to stay here what where you do well I suppose I could drive back and forth to Hilldale it's only 15 miles but I think it's better we have our own place near my job sorry dad so long Emily remember that first dinner you cook for us you didn't talk like that in those days I wonder what's happened to us [Music] with terrifying clarity emily was beginning to see the sort of person she had become [Music] we are from the couples Club at the church dr. emre said you used to be members of it yes we used to be quite active but for some reason we just couldn't seem to find time to keep it up there so many demands on our time now you understand but don't you see mrs. Dean Christianity isn't something that you keep to yourself it's well you've got to share it if you want to keep it as soon as I've heard that somewhere before a long time ago it isn't that we're not interested because we are it's just a bit well but don't you see it isn't so much that the church needs us it's that we need the church how it's meant so much to us calling on people and getting to know them in their own homes and really trying to do something for Christ every day you see mrs. Dean we think we found something we want to keep it always until we want others to have it too I've heard that somewhere before too I hope you can keep it perhaps mrs. Dean you'd like to sign one of these cards oh well I couldn't sign it just now mr. Dean and I'll have to talk it over first all right mrs.
