- Hi. - This is Richard. - Hello Richard. - Hello Richard. - Richard's one of our best workers aren't you Richard? So, how many did you do in the last hour? - Oh, about 80 Mr. DeFranco. - Are you goofing off again? Come on, come on, come on take a jab at me Richard. Come on, come on take a jab. - Oh no, you're not gonna get me into no fight, Mr. DeFranco, no. Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you, Richard. - Nice meeting you, Richard. - Hey Mr. DeFranco. - Hi Janet. - I like your tie. - You like that tie. - Yes I do. - Better than the other one? - Yes. - Oh why? - I don't know I just like it. It's got lots of colors. The other one was sort of ugly. - Really? Before I got this tie, you said you liked the other one and hated the one before that. - I did? - I tell you what, from now on you can pick out all my ties. - Ah, I don't know if I could that, Mr. DeFranco. Want me to show them what I'm doing? - Hey, how did you get so far ahead of me? - I'm smart. - Janet, I want you to meet Father Hayes, Father O'Riley. - Hello. - Hi Janet. - How come you always show people me working? - 'Cause you're the prettiest girl in the whole workshop. - No really? - Because you're smart, just like you said, Janet. In case you haven't noticed, Janet's a talker. Well, we'll see you later, Janet. Keep up the good work. - I will Mr. DeFranco. - Nice meeting you Janet. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - You know, Leonard, that girl doesn't look that er-- - Retarded, you're allowed to say it. - What Father O'Riley is trying to say is, well, she doesn't look like she belongs here. - Well she won't be after today. - Oh, you found a better situation for her? - Not exactly, Janet's unit's being laid off. Doesn't seem to be a lot of money to go around these days. - Lucy, you're gonna be in big trouble when Ricky gets home. You better behave. - Linens are hot. - Oh, thank goodness. Oh, 700 pounds of meat is a lot-- - Ethal, get out of there. Lucy's acting stupid again. Lucy, leave Ethal alone. Oh no, Lucy. Ethal's locked in the closet. - How was work? - Fine. Lucy's acting stupid today. I don't know why she's so stupid. If you don't straighten out Lucy, I'm not gonna watch you anymore. - Stop talking to the television. Lucy can't hear you. - I don't care. Lucy you're so stupid. - Where's mom sweetheart? - I don't know. She's in the kitchen making your dinner. Oh boy, Ethal, you better get out of there real quick. Lucy, Ethal's locked in the closet. - There's got to be a job. Why don't you put her on in another department? Oh, please, Leonard, there's got to be something. Okay, I understand, too well. Bye. - Janet and Lucy aren't doing too well today huh? - So I hear. - What's the problem? - Janet's been laid off. - You've got to be kidding me. She's one of the best employees. - There's no more government financing for her department. Oh David, she's going to be so disappointed. - She doesn't know? - No. How was Lucy? - Fine. Janet? Janet, turn the water off. I want to talk to you. - I'm not done. - Janet, how would you and mom like to take a little vacation, maybe go to Catalina? - Really? - Hmm hmm. - When? - Anytime you like. Tomorrow, next day, anytime. - I can't, I have to work. I thought you were building a library. - Come on, you go to Catalina with mom tomorrow, and then I'll join you over the weekend. - I can't take the time off. Christmas, I can go Christmas. - Wait honey. Erm, Janet, Mr. DeFranco called and said they have no money to pay you for your job so you're going to have to stay home until they get some more. - I don't wanna stay home. I want to go to work. - I know you do, sweetheart. - I don't care, I'm gonna go anyway. Daddy, you better take me to work tomorrow. - Jean, it's gonna work out. - The whole project? - No, Janet. You've been selfish. It's got to stop immediately. - Selfish? David, what the hell you're talking about? Janet hasn't been off my mind one moment in 21 years. All I've done is worry about her. - That's right. And where has all the worrying gotten her? - Pretty far, considering. - Considering what, that she's retarded? You don't even know how retarded she is. You still cut her fingernails, you're afraid she'll kill herself with a sharp object. I drive her to school. They've been bus-training retarded kids for how many years. - Well, we don't have to worry about that anymore since she's been laid off. - Janet, what are you doing with your coat on? - I have to go to work. Daddy, you better hurry up. I'm gonna be late. - But sweetheart, you didn't listen. - Oh no, no, all right, it's going to be your fault if Mr. DeFranco gets mad at me. - That's right, it's my fault. - Come on, daddy, let's go. - Janet. - Daddy, stand up. - Janet, take your coat off. You're not going to work. - I have to go to work. - No. - You have to get dressed. - You're not going. Mommy, get dressed, I have to go to work. - Take, take your coat off, there is no job. - I don't care, I want to go anyway. - I know you do. - That's not my fault, daddy. Come on, please come on, let me go to work. - I can't. - No! - Janet, listen to me, I'm not taking you to work. Will you stop it, Janet? Will you listen? Stop it. Will you stop it. Stop it, so help me I'll-- - David, that isn't the way you explain things. Janet dear now, I know you're disappointed but we'll find you another job. - No, you won't. - Yes we will, I-- - No you won't, I wanna go to work. - Now where's she going? - Come on, Janet, get in the house. - No, I want to go to work. - Janet, there is no job. Do you understand, no job, come on, come back in the house. Do you wanna stay out here and freeze in the rain? Go on, freeze. Will you come in the house. - No, no, I wanna go. I wanna go. No. No. - Please, David, no! - My god, my god. - Bruce, what do you wanna do today? - I don't know, we'll find something good, okay. - Hey Janet, walk with mommy for a little while. Can Janet stay with you for a couple of hours? - Why? - We're looking for a possible situation for her. - What does that mean? - A place to live. - I can't believe you're still trying to put her in an institution. - It's not an institution, it's private. It better be for 10,000 a year. - Oh well, excuse me, country club. - Bruce, what the hell do you want? - What do I want? I don't want her to go to an institution, that's what I want. - You've got nothing to do with it, it's not your decision. - Why, she's my sister? - Mommy likes the place. Janet will stay there for the weekend and there are no guarantees. If they feel they can do something for Janet, they'll keep her. - Keep her. Well, what if she doesn't want to be kept? Dad, all I'm saying is, let me see the place first, that's all. I won't make a scene I promise. I just wanna feel like you've made the right decision, that's all. - Okay. - All right, let's eat. - What do you want, dear? - I don't know. - Have a hamburger. - Okay. - Have whatever you want. Come on, take some food. - I don't know what to have. - Whatever you want. We'll be here all day. Here, take a salad. Do you want a hotdog? - I like roast beef. - They don't have roast beef. Here, have a hamburger, come on. It's like old home week in here. - Where's your lunch? - Ah, I'm not hungry. - Er, Janet, here take your medication. - No, I don't want to. - It'll help you relax. Here's my water. Here, take your pill. - What is that? - I forgot a fork. - It's Thorazine. - Thorazine. - Yes, the doctor said it would calm her down. - And you let her take it? I can't believe you. - Excuse me, excuse me, could I ask you a question? - What? - I was thinking, are you retarded? - None of your business. You're retarded, not me. - There's the admissions office person. Wait here with your sister. - Sit over here. - Janet, would you like to come with us. - Yes. - This is our recreation room, lounge, whatever. - It's ugly here, I don't like it. - It sure is. Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm taking my daughter and I'm getting out of here. - That's a stupid bed. - Thanks for the tour. - Mrs. Oberman, I'd like to deal with this sooner. Naturally discuss the situation with my wife and, if it's all right with you I'd like to return in a week or so with Janet and leave her with you on a trial basis. ♪ Do do, do do do do ♪ ♪ Do do ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪ - Bruce, about time. - Come on, come on keep on dancing. How would you like to come with me today, huh? Go for a ride, do some shopping, a little fun. - Can't, the Lakers are playing. - Oh, you can miss one game. - I can't. - Why, they're playing a lousy team, it's not even gonna be close. - Where did you say you wanted to go? - For a ride, come on, go get your purse. - Okay. - Where are you going? - Ah, can I borrow your car? I want to take Janet out for the day. - Oh, good idea. Oh here, take Janet for a nice lunch. - I'll take care of it. - They opened the new giraffe house at the zoo. - So? - Well, Janet hasn't seen it yet. - Good. - She's a pretty girl, Bruce. - You think so? - Yes I do. She reminds me of this girl on General Hospital. - You like General Hospital. - It's okay. Except the people are always getting sick and they're always having problems. If you love somebody you should love them, you know. You shouldn't have problems. I don't look like anybody on TV. Bruce, do you think I'm pretty? - Of course you are. Would I have a sister that's not pretty? - Well, I'm not pretty like that girl, though. - You're prettier, 'cause you're nicer. Now don't you want to know where we're going? - Yes. - Santa Monica, ever been there before? - I don't think so. - I'm taking you to meet some people. - Who? - Well, they're people like you. Only they don't live at home anymore. - They don't? - No, they live in a really nice house. Thought you might like to meet them and see how they live. They're not real retarded, do you know what I mean? - Ah huh. - Am I real retarded? - Oh. - Okay, stand over here. No dummy, on the other side. Okay, okay let's go. Come on. - I don't like it when you steal anything. - Shh, don't talk in here. We're on a winning street today, Billy. - Did you get any batteries for your calculator, Andrew? - I just got it. When I need batteries I'll get batteries, okay. Hey, oh, come here look at this. Ah look at all this this stuff, wow. - Oh, I'm not going in there Andrew. - I know, I know. I'm gonna have a store just like that. - Can I wait in the car? - Come on, I want you to meet some people. If you don't like it here we'll leave, okay. - We will? - We will. - You promise? - Come on, I promise. - Bruce? - Hi Mr. Hollister. - All right, this must be Janet. - Say "Hello" Janet. - Hello. - Hello Janet, how are you? Nice to see you, I'm Les. - We have to be back home for dinner. - Don't worry about it. - Oh, don't pay any attention to Max. Come on, give me your hand. That's it, he won't hurt you, come on, come on Max. Say "Hello" to Janet. Good Max. - Good Max. This is a nice dog. This is a nice house. - Would you like to see the rest of it? - I don't know. - Come on, let me show you. Come on, come on. - Hi Bruce. Good to see you again. - Honey, this is Janet. Janet, my wife Pat. - Hi Janet. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - I got you beat tonight. - Just coming in, yeah. Where have you guys been? - Oh, we were out erm, walking around looking in the stores. Yeah, you should see the calculator Andrew's got. - Let's see it, Andrew. - Ah, he, he just made that one up, Pat. - Come on. - I didn't do nothing, Pat. - Give it to me Andrew. Ah, Andrew what's going on? I thought you'd stopped this a long time ago. - I don't like you, I don't like you doing this in front of people, Pat. I hate you Billy. - Now you march in the kitchen. You put your name in the doghouse. It's not coming down until Monday morning when you take this back. - I, I-- - Nah nah, don't swear. - I have to go to work on Monday. The kids in the nursery school need me. - Yeah, well that's too bad isn't it. I just hope the store doesn't call the police. - Kareem now with 18 points. He's two for two from the free throw line. Make that three for three. A 62 percent free thrower. 87-76, pressure in a back court applied by Los Angeles. That's Henderson trying to get it into the front court and does his damnedest. Doubled teamed. That's Johnson, to Ballard, all alone he hits it. And as he pointed out earlier is a problem when you double team, somebody is open. 87-78 Lakers lead, 5:50 left of the ball game. That's Gently, guarded by Ballard, battered away by Ballard. Over to Nixon, underneath there Wilkes, and off of Jamal, out of bounds, Washington. - Hey. Hey I met you, you in the cafeteria, remember. - To Gently, he scores! - My name is Andrew. Hey don't you remember me? - No. - Norm Nixon, Gently to Bucket, 87-78 Los Angeles. Double teamed-- - So, who's playing? - The Knicks and the Lakers. - It's Johnson, his shot, no good, rebound patted. - I live here, you know. - Awful long jump shot. That's usually what happens. Team is disorganized-- - So, are you gonna be living here too? - No. - That's too bad. - Fine play by Jabbar. - Do you always where those glasses. - Yes. - It's too bad. They're ugly. They make you look funny. - You look funny. - Mom, what I want, no we're not gonna be home for dinner. And if things work out here, I wanna-- Well you come down and get her then, 'cause I'm not bringing her home, okay? Yeah, I'll be waiting for you. - What do you think Jean? - Erm, it's all right. - All right? Is that all you can say? Mr. Hollister, I'd be delighted if you'd take Janet. - Okay, that's one of you. What about you, Mrs. Michaels, is there something you don't like? - Oh I, no no, I didn't say I didn't like anything. No the facilities seem quite nice. And you both seem like very nice people. - Thank-you. - Maybe we could speak privately for just a moment. - Come on, I'll get you a cup of coffee. - I'm going to be real blunt with you, Mrs. Michaels, you have a lousy attitude. - You didn't give birth to a retarded child. - No, I didn't, thank god. But what are you gonna do, punish yourself for the rest of your life by holding onto Janet? - I'm holding onto her because I love her. - Yes of course, I know, of course you do. But, the fact is she's being deprived of an independent life. - I know. I can't help it. - Yeah. - It's a nice room. Janet has terrible habits. She watches television all day. - Oh, she won't here, no no. Everybody here holds a part-time or full-time job. Some hold two, Andrew, for instance. - She won't eat your food. - Oh, you let me worry about that. - All right. - Want a cup of coffee? - Yeah. - Great. - Now I'll see you tomorrow. - Where are you staying? - With mom and dad. - Where are they staying? - At a motel. - Why can't I stay there? - Because you're tired and it's too far away. - Hmm. Are we going home tomorrow? - Okay, slick, you go to sleep. - I don't want to stay here. - It's so fast. David, we're going so fast. - 21 years isn't fast. - I know I'm being silly. Suddenly I'm worse at making decision than Janet is. - Dad, you better go to the motel without me. - Why, what's the matter? - Nothing, I'm just gonna stay 'til she feels comfortable. Dad, do me a favor, take mom back okay. Come on you, I'm gonna show you how to play checkers. You know Janet, if you give it a chance, I think you'll start to like it here. - No, I'll go home. - You know, mom and dad aren't gonna live forever. What are you gonna do if they die, huh? - I don't know. I'll come live with you. - Ah, Janet, that's not the answer. I moved away from home. It wasn't easy but I did it. You know something? - What? - It was the best thing I ever did. And now I'm very happy. - You are? - Yeah. And you will be too. Now I'm leaving in the morning. - No, no no no! No, no! - Janet, I'll call you every day! - You promised I could go home if I wanted to. - Janet, I promised a lot of things. - You promised me. I wanna go home, I wanna see mommy and daddy. - Mommy and daddy aren't out there. There's no one to take you home! - I want to go home! - Just wait 'til morning! - No, I wanna go now. - You wanna go, go ahead, go. - You promised I could go home, Bruce. - Janet, take your medication. - Why did you lie to me? - Jane, take your medication. - You promised I could go. - Take your medication. - I don't want to. - I said take it. - Smells good Billy. - See you after church. - I pray for you, Pat. - Thanks. - Pray for me too Silvia. - Okay Billy. - Pat, when are you gonna take my name out of the doghouse? - I told you that last night. As soon as you return that calculator, and you remember that just as well as I do. - I'm not talking to you, Billy. - It's not Billy's fault. What you did wasn't right. To take somebody else's property that doesn't belong to you, that's not right. - I know. - Hey, would you break these eggs for me please. - Sure. I don't want that new girl to see it, you know. - Yeah. - I mean, I don't mean to take things, Mrs. Hollister. Sometimes I just do it, that's all. - I'm not taking your name out of the doghouse, Andrew. - Ah for-- - Ah but but but. There you go, bigshot. - Go away. - Brunch. - I know. - You look different. What did you do with your glasses? - I'm not wearing them. - Can I see? - No. - I'm not gonna do anything, I just wanna look. - Leave me alone. - Okay. I'm leaving. You better get down to brunch. You're nobody special, you know. - I'm not coming, I hate it here. - Do you hate me? - Yes. - How, how come you hate me? - I don't know. - I don't hate you. - So? - Can you see without your glasses. - Not really. - That's too bad. You look better without them. They make a dent on the top of your nose. - Have you put the stuff in the garage like I told you? - Silvia, go on. - Oh boy. - Buttered. - I made the soup, you know. I made the soup today. - It's dumb. - Hey, where's Janet. - She didn't want to come down again. I could take some food up to her, though. - That's a good idea, yeah. - Andrew gots a girlfriend. - I'm not talking to you, Billy. You keep it up and I'm not taking you bowling this week. - Billy, don't start in, please. - I didn't mean nothing. - Join hands. Give me your hand, Billy. Join hands. Got is kind, god is good and we thank him for the food. Amen. - Amen. - Barb, cut it out. - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take up some food. - Okay. - Ooh. - Cut it out, Mark. Can I come in? - No. I'm in here now. - I left some food in your room. You're supposed to eat, you know. I made the soup myself. Are you a good cook? I'm a very good cook. - What do you make? - I make spaghetti and meatballs and I make lasagna. I like Italian food. My, my mother makes it. She lives in New York City. - I was in New York City. - You were? Were you in Queens, that's where my mother lives. - No, but I was in the Empire State Building. - No kidding. I know that place. Do you know that, that you could see Queens from the Empire State Building? I was there. Did you go there? - Yes. - No kidding. Did you go to the Statue of Liberty? - Yes. We went to the top there too. My daddy had to carry me down, it was so steep. - Do you want to go to work with me tomorrow? - I'm going home. - Can you wait until the weekend? - Not really. - Oh. - Where do you work? - I work part-time at the cafeteria and part-time at the nursery school. - Which one do you go to tomorrow? - So, what are they doing today? - Making a scarecrow. - Oh yeah? Well, it doesn't, doesn't look like a scarecrow to me. - That' 'cause we're waiting for a tall man to put the head on. - Who? - What do you mean who? You! - Okay, I can do that. Look out kids, I'm gonna put the head on now. - Ah. - Okay? - Oh, we forgot the mouth. - Oh yeah. - Would you like to draw the mouth. - Oh yeah, come on Janet, you draw the mouth on him. - Okay. - No no, that's no good, it's not supposed to be smiling. That's not gonna scare anybody. Right Mrs. Walker. - I forgot. - Yeah. - I don't know, it doesn't look right. I know, I know. - No no, don't take your scarf off, you'll catch a cold. - No I won't. - Oh. - Can I make it a girl? - Janet, you can't make it a girl. It's supposed to be a scarecrow, right Mrs. Walker. - Oh, I don't know about that, Andrew. I think it's about time we had a scarecrow woman around here, don't you agree. - No. - That's small. She needs some hair, though. I could pretend it's under the hat, though, tucked in like a bun. - I know. You said you wanted it to be a girl, right. Come on, kids, make more paper balls. - Andrew. - Now it really looks like a girl doesn't it, Mrs. Walker. I could be here all day. - Are you mad at me 'cause I made the scarecrow a woman? - No, but I still think it should've been a man. - Next time we can make it a man. - Oh, I don't think we'll be making anymore scarecrows this year. Hey, be careful, be careful. The bus isn't gonna be here for another couple of minutes. The bus company is very undependable. - You always go to work by yourself? - Well, Mr. and Mrs. Hollister used to follow me in their car. Ah, but now I take the bus all by myself. Except of course, you're with me. Hey, maybe Mrs. Walker will hire you too. - You forgot I'm going home. - Oh yeah. Well, maybe if you er stay she'll hire you. - Are you sure we're at the right bus stop? - Don't worry, I know, I know right where, okay, here comes a bus. Now, does it say number five? I, yes it does, okay, this is our bus. Do you have money? - No, I don't have any money. - Okay, it's okay, I have money but let's go. Hi. How you doing? - Fine thanks. - Hey, why don't you laugh at somebody else, okay. I don't wanna, I don't want to have to tell you again, I wish you would stop laughing. Come on, let's go, I wanna take another bus. - We could move to the back. - No, it's too crowded. They're making me disturbed. Come on. Some people can be real stupid, you know. - Yeah, there's a bus stop there. - You know what I tell them, "Shut up." - Ah huh, I know what you mean. I don't like the way they look at you. - I hate being, being retarded. - Were you in special classes? - What? - Were you in special classes? - No, I never didn't live at home. - You didn't? - No, I've been all around. Hey, hey look at all of the-- Hey let's go in here. - You want to? - Well, well yeah sure. Look at all these glasses. They'd be great on you. - You think so? - Can I help you? - I'd like to get some glasses for my friend, Janet. Those are ugly, the ones she's got on. - All right. Do you know what kind you want? - Oh yeah, one of the ones in the window. Try these on. - How do they look? - I think they look better in the window. What else you got? - This should do it. - Oh yeah, these are nice. What do you think? - I can't see without the glass. - Ah, I don't know now. I think they might be too big. What else you got? - Andrew was late again. - Hope he's not in the shops. - Ah, don't even suggest it. - Did Janet come out of her room today? - What do you mean, you took her to work this morning, didn't-- - No, she didn't want to go. - Ah, I can't believe this. I made her bed this morning. That means she's been gone all day. - All right, don't get excited. Maybe she's with Andrew. - Maybe she isn't. - All right, I tell you what. You call Alice Walker, see if she's over there. Then run down to the bus stop. If they're not on the next bus then we'll call the police. - I like these. - Yeah, yeah I like those too. - How much do those cost? - The frames will be $34 plus tax. Then you have to buy the lenses. - My paycheck is for $38. Could I buy the frames now and then could buy the lenses later? Will you take my paycheck? - If you endorse it. - Where? - Right there. - I wanna wear my new glasses. - You can't see with them yet. - I know. I could hold onto you. - All right, I'm really glad you got those. They look good. - They do? - Yeah, you look pretty. Oh boy, oh no. We've been doing so much, so much talking I don't know where we are. Do you know what street it is? - Alameda. - Oh no, we're supposed to be on Euclid Avenue, I can't believe we got lost. - Well, we could ask somebody. - Well, do you see anybody? Ah crud. I can't believe I got us into this. If we went downtown we could ask somebody, 'cause always somebody to ask downtown. You know what, we better, we better call Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. Let's find a phone booth. - Maybe she got raped. - Oh hush Sylvia, she did not. - She's not at home, I checked the whole house. - Mark, what are you doing downstairs? You're sick. That's all I need is all you guys getting the flu. - Andrew probably got caught stealing. - No he didn't, he doesn't steal. - Yes he does, I found some stuff he took. - Mark. - No he doesn't. I know it. - Oh oh, I bet it's the police. Hello. Andrew, where are you? No no no, you stay right there. I'll be right down to pick you up. Okay, bye bye. Everything's fine, I'll be right back. Hey. - I'm sorry, we got lost. - Ah, we were worried to death about you guys. - I'm sorry. - Pat, Pat, look at the new glasses that Andrew got me. - Oh they're-- - Yeah. - Where are the lenses? - We, we go back and get the lenses next week. - Where did you get them? - Ah, I don't know. - Do you remember, Janet? - Yes, it was at a glasses store. - Yeah. - Where, Andrew? - I, I don't remember. I could find my way back there, though. - Do you have a receipt? - A what? - A sales slip, something that shows that you paid for them. - Ah no, no do you have a receipt? Ah ah. - Janet, would you wait in the car for a second please. Let me have the glasses. - No, they're mine. Andrew got them for me. - Come on, honey. - No they're mine. - Pat, I told you that I paid for them. - I don't believe you, Andrew. - Pat! - I don't believe you. - Why not? - Nobody buys glasses without the lenses or having a sales receipt or something. - I told you that we're gonna go pick up the lenses next week. Pat you, you are not-- - Andrew. - Pat, you are not acting normal today. - What do you expect me to think? Okay. - I don't want to talk to you about it. - Come on okay. - I don't want to talk to you about it. - With the business with the calculator, what do you expect me to think? - Hi Janet. - Hi. - Andrew's depressed. - I'm sorry I got you in trouble. Here. - You didn't get me in any trouble. You keep them. - He can't go to the movies. He can't go bowling, he can't do nothing for two weeks. He can't even-- - Shut up Billy. - I don't have to. - Okay, then don't shut up. Come on Janet. - I like the colors you chose for the rug. - When I'm angry I play pool. - When I'm angry it depends. Sometimes I throw a tantrum like when people get in my way. Most of the time I just have to be by myself. - Do you wanna try one? - I don't know how. - I'll show you. Okay, come over here. Now you hit this one. Hold it. Hmm hmm, hold it in the back. Okay, now you, you wanna hit it in there. - Okay. - Ready? Go. - I missed it. - It's okay. You know, we've gotta find that glasses store. Do you have to go back with your parents tomorrow? - Yes, I have to. But you could come and visit me. - I wish you didn't have to go back. We really gotta find that store. You wanna look tomorrow? - Les? - Yeah. - They're gone again. - Oh no, don't tell me that. Are you sure? - Yeah. - How did he get passed me? - I don't know but Janet's parents are gonna be here any minute with their clothes. - What are you gonna tell them? - The truth. - Is Andrew in more trouble? - Oh, is he ever. - Yeah, so is this one. - I don't know Andrew. I don't remember a river. - No, ah ah. We've gotta find it. - Yeah. I know, why don't we go back to your school and then come back like we did the first time. - That's not a bad idea. That's a good idea. Okay, let's try that. - Okay. - Ah, it just makes me so nervous. - Don't worry, we're going to find it. - In other words, you're implying he's a kleptomaniac. - Well, I think that's a little harsh. - Oh, I'm sorry, it's hard to be sympathetic with your daughter roaming the streets. Well from what you've told us, at least he has the good sense to call when he gets lost. - Can't you keep Janet away from the boy? - Ah, you know Les, maybe we should send Janet home. I don't want her getting dependent on Andrew if he's going to start this stuff again and frankly they're getting pretty attached. - If it's at all possible, I want her to stay. - If you think she'd do better at home. - Oh oh, look who's here. Oh, hey. - Where've you been? - Where've you been? What is-- Oh, Andrew. Oh, I'm, oh, Les, look at that. - Mommy, daddy, is it okay if I stay here for another week or two? - Ah, well Janet I have to discuss it with your father. - Daddy? - Whatever your mother says. - Mommy? - Erm. - What's the matter, mommy, can't you make up your mind? - It's okay, for both of us. - Hi. I'm Andrew Madison. - Hello. - Hello. What do you think? - It's empty. - Well, it's empty right now. It's not always empty. - Oh. - I hope it's open. Sometimes they lock the building. You never can tell. Can you climb a ladder? - Yes, I think so. - Good. It's over here in this building. - It is? - Yeah. - Oh. - Well, this is it. - You could break your neck here. - No, it's okay. - It's very high up here. - Yeah. This is where I sit. Well, what do you think? - I love it. It's almost the best place I've ever been to next to the Empire State Building. - Do you ever wanna go back to New York City again because I don't. - I don't either. - No, I want to live here. - Me too. - Yeah. But I've got to figure out a way to make a lot of money, because right now I get paid lousy. You know Les says he's gonna get me a better job. I'll be putting headsets together for airlines. You know, when you listen to music. - Ah ha. They hurt my ears. - Well, that's because they don't make them right. - My hand's sweating Andrew. I like it here. - Yeah. Let's go, Janet. - I can't Andrew, it's too steep. - No it isn't. I got down, come on. - I need help. - If I don't need help, you don't need help. Come on, Janet. - You're making me cry, Andrew. - Well, you're making me mad, Janet. - Andrew you're making me a crybaby. I'm afraid, now help me. - No, I won't. If you don't come, I'm leaving you here. - I can't do it. - You're acting like a stupid retard. - Andrew, don't go away! Please Andrew, I don't know what to do. Andrew, come back, please. - Okay, okay, stop crying. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry. Stop crying. Now come on down, I won't let you fall. - Don't be mad at me, Andrew. I was scared. - I thought you could do it by yourself. - Thank-you Andrew. I'll try next time. - Janet, everybody's waiting for you in the car. - I know Andrew. I'll be right there. - Are you sure you're okay. You've been in your room for over two hours. You're beautiful. - I did it for you Andrew. I didn't want you to be ashamed of me. - Oh, I, I would never be ashamed of you, Janet. But, you're the most beautiful girl that I ever saw. - We better go. - I bet you're gonna be the most beautiful girl in the whole bowling alleys. I love you Janet. I want to marry you. - Okay. When? Andrew. Andrew, you're not supposed to be here. You're supposed to be in your own bed. - Do you love me? - Yes, but you're supposed to be in your own bed. Those are the rules. - When you, when you love somebody, and you're gonna get married, you're supposed to make love. You can't make love and be in your own bed unless the other person is there too. - I know. I can't breathe, Andrew. - You're supposed to breathe through your nose. - Oh. - How was that? - That was good. - My arm. - Hmm. - Andrew, stop, you're too heavy. Get off! You're a terrible person, Andrew. I hate you. I don't want to marry you. I never wanna see you again. Get out of here. - Hey, you know, you're really an idiot, you know that. You don't, you don't even know what it's about. - Yes I do. - No you don't. Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck. Goose. - Duck, goose. - Duck, duck, duck. I'm not talking to you Andrew. I hate you. You creep on people. - Didn't you ever make love before. - Not like that. - Well how did you do it? - Never mind. Go away. - Didn't anybody ever, ever teach you anything about sex? - No. - Oh well, we don't have to do it anymore if you don't want to. Even if we do it won't hurt, but we don't have to. I love you, Janet. I just, I just want to be you. - I love you too, Andrew. - I could teach you about, about making love if you want. - I have to think about it. - But I thought you loved me. - I do, when you don't creep on me. Andrew. Andrew. Andrew, I want you to teach me about sex. - Oh Andrew. - I thought this was your bed, Andrew. I couldn't see, I was coming to see you. Not you Billy. - You better keep your mouth shut tomorrow, okay. Let's go into your room. - Okay. Promise you won't creep on me too hard. - Okay, I promise. - Yeah, I'm coming. - Morning. - Morning. - Up early. - Can we come in? - Sure, sure. - We just want to talk to you for a minute. - Sure, okay. Do you wanna come in and sit down? - We'll stand. - Sounds serious. - We want to get married. - Right away. - Well, I think I'll sit down. - Yeah well er, why don't you come on in and sit down and we'll discuss it. - Well we can discuss it if you want to but we're still gonna get married. What's this big surprise? - I want to, I want to marry your sister, Bruce. - What? - I want to marry Janet. - Why? - Because we love each other. We have it all figured out, Bruce. - Yeah, I've got a job, and so does Janet. Together, we make $87 a week. - Where could you live on that? - Well, there was this girl who used to live at the hostel, and now she has her own apartment. The state pays for it. - We don't need the state to pay. I'm going to be working for the airlines pretty soon, and I'm going to be making over 100 bucks a week myself. - Well, what about children? - Oh no. - Are you gonna have some of those right? - No, we don't want to have any children right now. - No, my doctor says there's an operation that I could have so that we wouldn't have to have any right away. - You know what I think? - No, what? - I think you're crazy to get married. You should stay good friends, that's enough. - No, we want to get married, Bruce. - I thought you would want us to get married. - Married? Janet, this is the first guy you ever met. You never even lived away from home before. What's your hurry? - Well, I don't care if you don't want us to, Bruce, we're gonna get married anyway. - Then go ahead! Louse up the rest of your life. You can't stay in the hostel like everybody else. No, you have to go mess it up and get married. - I think you better stop talking stupid, Bruce. - Well, they're not gonna let you get married, Janet. You know what's gonna happen to you? You're going home. You're gonna rot at home like you did before. You're gonna have a lousy life, Janet. Lousy, both of you, lousy! - Probably would have been better if I wasn't ever born. - Don't say that. I'm sorry, Janet, I didn't mean it. - Don't cry Bruce. - I think you're making a big mistake. - I thought you weren't going to encourage them. - Oh we didn't. As a matter of fact, we tried to talk them out it, but the more we talked the more we realized how much they'd matured emotionally. They, they're in love, they love each other. - They're retarded. - Look er, Mr. and Mrs. Michaels, Andrew and Janet could get an apartment, nearby, close to the hostel. It's part of our independent living project. If there is any problem, Pat and I will be close by to take care of it, we could handle it. I mean, I know it isn't common practice but-- - Absolutely not. - Janet's gonna fight you, because you're not taking home the same girl who sat catatonic in front of our television set three month ago. - There's one thing about television, Mr. Hollister. You don't get pregnant from it. ♪ Go out and get her ♪ ♪ Remember to let her into your heart ♪ ♪ Then you can you start to make it better ♪ ♪ Better better better ah ♪ ♪ Da da da da da da da, da da da da, hey June ♪ ♪ Bum bum bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Da da da da da da, da da da, hey June ♪ - Bruce, where's the car? Give me the keys to the car, Bruce. - Hey dad. - Give me the keys to the car. - All right. Here. Hey you don't have to do that. Everything's settled. Janet's staying and she's getting married too. So forget it. - Come on, Janet dear. Let's go home. - What's going on? - Andrew, come on. - Where's Janet going? - She's going with her parents. - We're getting married. I want to talk to Mrs. Michaels. Please may I talk to Mrs.-- Let go of me! Mrs. Michaels, we won't get married if you let her stay, please. Please let her stay, we won't get married if you let her stay. - Get away, Andrew. - Please don't go. Please Janet. Janet. Janet! I love Janet, I want Janet, I want Janet. - Janet dear, let's get you a new bathing suit when we get to Catalina. - It's too cold. - Break them up, Andrew. Come on, concentrate Andrew. - If it's sunny tomorrow, why don't we take the boat round the island. - That's a good idea. I think Janet would like that. - Hi, how'd those glasses work out? - Oh, I don't know. - Anything I can help you with? - No. - I'll be with you in a minute. It's nice seeing you. It's er, Andrew isn't it? - Yeah. I took those. - Janet, it's time for your medication. Would you like to take a little nap before dinner. There's plenty of time. - No. - Would you like to watch some television? Just standing there, Janet, is not going to solve things. Honey, honey we love you, and we're only trying to do what's best for you. I know it doesn't seem right to you this very minute, believe me. We don't want to hurt you. Shall I stay until you take your medication? Shall I leave your door open? - Janet, is that you? - Yes. I'm going to the bathroom. - Okay, honey, I'll call you when dinner's ready. - Okay. - Mr. and Mrs. Michaels. Open the door please. Mr. and Mrs. Michaels. Open the door please, I want to talk to Janet, please. Janet! Janet! Janet it's Andrew. - Bye boat. - Mr. and Mrs. Michaels. Would you please open, open the door. - David, David, Janet's gone. Janet! Janet! - Where the hell is she? - I don't know. - The boat's gone. - Oh no. Oh, I should've stayed with her. Oh David, she was so upset. I should've stayed with her. - Janet! Janet! Janet! - Excuse me, does this boat go to Los Angeles? - Yes it does. - Thank-you. - Yeah, hello. - Hello Mrs. Hollister. - Janet, honey, where are you? Are you okay? - I'm fine. May I speak to Andrew please? - Janet, your parents, huh, everybody's worried sick about you. Where are you? - I want to speak to Andrew. - Well, he's not here right now. Why don't you tell me where you are? I'll come pick you up. - I'm not telling, only Andrew. - Janet, please. - Okay, you could tell Andrew I'm gonna wait for him at his spot. - Where's that? - I'm not telling! - Andrew, Janet called a little while ago and said she'd be at your spot. - She did? I don't believe it. How did she get there? - Andrew, please take us to her. - I'm not taking you anywhere. - Andrew. - No. No no, that's my secret spot, and it's Janet's secret spot, and I'm not taking you. And you know something else, Mr. and Mrs. Michaels? I'm not gonna bring her back until you promise that we can stay together and get married. Because Janet and I are very capable people, and we love each other, and we're gonna get married. And you're not gonna keep us apart anymore. - You're very determined, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - So am I. - I don't care. You mean you're gonna take her back home again? You mean you're not gonna take her back home again? - No. - And we could get married? - Well-- - How about next week? - Well, er, next week, I, I-- - We were thinking about Sunday. - Oh. - Oh Mrs. Michaels I love you. Mr. Michaels too, Mr. Michaels. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh Bruce, Bruce, I'm I, I love you erm. - I know, I know, you too Pat. - Okay, okay, I, oh, I love you. Erm, wait, okay I, I'll be right back okay. Just wait, okay. Janet! Janet! - Andrew. - Janet we, we can get married! Janet, Janet, Janet we can get married. - Andrew, Andrew, I thought I'd never see you again. - I thought I'd never see you too. - I love you, Andrew. - And I love you Janet. Janet, you got down all by yourself. - I did, didn't I. - Oh, I really love you. - I love you, I love you. - We can get married. - We can. - Well, why are we waiting. - Hi mom. - My brother's a good clarinet player. - You look beautiful. - So do you. Do you really like the way I look? - If I didn't I wouldn't be here. - It was my mother's wedding dress. - It's beautiful.
