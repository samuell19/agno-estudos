Right this way. I used to come up here a lot when i was younger. Probably stopped coming up When i was about 16 or so. So... Party time. That was a healthy riff. I'm a healthy individual. I would kill for a cabin like yours. I would kill. - I know. - It's beautiful. But... My memories of the place Are of me stuck in a tiny cabin With my dad. So. Could it really be that bad? Well, my dad was a little bit Of an alcoholic. I don't know. I probably sound like an ungrateful asshole saying this, But i feel like leaving it to me Was just his final "fuck you." And it's embarrassing... But i really just wanted his money. What? - What? - I'm sorry. I'm really high. Whose money? Sorry, uh... See, i kinda left that part out. - What part? - Uh, The reason i'm up here Is, uh, Is my, um, My dad died Like a couple weeks ago. He left me the cabin in his will. I definitely left that part out. Sorry. No, it's cool. Like we, we didn't talk. So. My dad was right. I am fucking irresponsible. I have otis for two days And i lose him. Then let's find him. It doesn't do much good to just Feel sorry for yourself all the time. Right? Did i just seem like i feel sorry for myself? - Sort of. - Look. We'll go with you tomorrow and if nothing else You can rehash the rest of your fucked up childhood. So, you'll have that to look forward to. Sold. - Otis! - Otis! So, we're about a half mile north From where we found you, so i figure He's somewhere between here, Lava beds, cinder fields, and all that. I have no idea how the fuck You know where we are right now. I'm totally lost. You should really learn how to use a compass. Is that like on a cell phone or something? Otis! - Otis! - Otis! Otis! Wow! Well, this is crazy. I'm having flashbacks of my dad Skinny dipping in this lake. Not a good flashback to have. Ah, what is she doing? Lighten up, kid. Okay. Come on in.

Put it in my already or something. - That is frightening. - Seriously, at that point, You can just upload your mind to a server somewhere - And live forever. - Like in the internet or something. Yeah, the internet, a robot. You can put a brain in another body. Hell, i wouldn't mind putting my brain in your body And having that. - It'd be awesome. - We are not the weird ones. I mean, seriously. It seems like the next logical step. No? I mean, fuck. Death terrifies me. I mean, like, just think about it. Like, at some point, everything is just like, Done. Forever. You're a real splash of sunshine, kid. I understand that, though. I mean, i distinctly remember What it felt like When i realized i was gonna die. I used to crawl in bed with mom and dad And just sob. I am being a total buzzkill. No, i mean, it's okay. - Are you guys hungry? - Yes, i am starving. Well, get excited.

So the cold water was welcomed By the time noon or one rolled around, And we took several swim breaks on the way up." You know, I don't know you, like, at all. But i really feel like if you just forgave him For all that stuff That you'd feel so much better. I mean... Neither of you can win anymore. You know? Where did you come from?
