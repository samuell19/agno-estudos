[MUSIC PLAYING] [DRIVER SHOUTING] DRIVER: Hyah! Hyah, come on. Hyah! [TELEGRAPH KEY CLACKING] Must you play with that thing? Sorry. Just passing the time. Had no idea it disturbed you. Mentally, I've been heaving you and that whatchamacallit out of the window for hours. It's a telegraph key. In my line, you have to practice to keep your speed up. Well, don't wear yourself out. [TAPPING] I was just introducing myself. Granger's the name. New telegrapher for the railroad. Maybe now that you're awake, you feel like talking. A bad guess. Not even ten words? [TAPPING RESUMES] [COUGHING] What's the matter, Jessie? A little smoke oughtn't to bother you. Oh, go arrest somebody. See? Nobody likes a peace officer. Maybe they're too busy gasping for breath. Not Jessie here. Fresh air'd poison her. If you're a bachelor and are settling into Oaktown, you'll get to know her real well. You never did, fat stuff. My name is Jessie Loraine. BLANEY: She works in The Silver Dollar. It's a saloon, a gambling hall. I've found that men that condemn such places most are usually their best customers. Hyah, then! Come on. Whoa. [GASPS] Better get back inside. It's not very pretty. That's Hawley the lineman. All right. What an awful way to die. You know of a good one? Give me a hand. We'll cut him down. What for? We'd better mosey. Out here we'd be easy pickings. You're not gonna leave him up there. He won't get lonesome. DRIVER: Anyhow, we got no room 'lessen you put him inside. Put him on top. No. Look, Mister, it's like he said... Not a bit of room. Then we'll make room. Thunder and lightnin', that's good whiskey. BLANEY: It's a good thing none of them broke. Hard liquor... That's what saved them. Get it, "hard liquor"? You're wasting time. That new railroad feller, I don't like him. His eyes ain't eyes, they're rocks. Yeah, he's tough, plenty strong. One pull like this and our barrels went off. Hyah! Well, well, look who's back. If you're going to ask if I had a good trip, don't. From now on I'm taking my vacations in bed with a batch of cold drinks to keep me company. That's where I work, if you're interested. I don't play cards anymore. I had enough of that in the army. We also serve drinks. But on second thought, considering what we serve, it's almost safer to play cards. Do you come with the deck? Sure, I'm a wild deuce. Oh, Jenks, did you pick up my cattle medicine? Sure did, Mr. Broden. I'll fish it right out for you. I think you'd better take care of the body first. Funny, can't seem to find it. Must have bounced off when we hit a chuckhole. [GROANS] [CROWD MUTTERING] [GRUNTING] [WINDOW SHATTERS] Aren't you going to stop it? You're the sheriff. The boys are just letting off steam. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Beat it. [GRUNTS] [PUNCHES LANDING] Now go on out and bring in the body. [GRUNTS] Del! [LAUGHS] You always did throw a rotten right. Hey, you're getting soft. Ross, you old mule-hide. What are you doing around here? Making new friends. I never thought I'd run into any old ones. Hey, you're dressed like a dude. Oh, yeah, all duded up. I'm living. I've owned The Silver Dollar there ever since the war ended. Whatever got you west of St. Louis? A job. I'm a railroad telegrapher these days. What happened? I couldn't see much from the gallery. Oh, just a small slaughter. You remember me telling you about my old wartime buddy? DEL: Meet Ross Granger. How do you do? It's a pleasure. I've heard so much about you. I don't always look like this. Put Miss Dennison down on your list of females to lay off of. Not only is she my girl, she's your new boss's daughter. Oh. ANN: You're the new telegrapher. Yes, ma'am. There must be a story in it. I remember the day we mustered out, he swore that he was going to spend the rest of his life avoiding trouble. Somebody should warn you... Around these parts, railroaders don't send out laundry. I gathered as much. We found a lineman today that went off salary kind of sudden. His name was Hawley. Hawley? One more week, he'd have been back with his wife and kids. I'd better go tell dad. Very nice to have met you, Mr. Granger. I'm going after her. Come to my place tonight for dinner.Right. Mr. Stewart, did he tell you what the fight was about? Not now, Jenks. I'm busy. You'd better listen. He pushed your whiskey barrels off to make room for a stiff. Well, what are you standing here for? Go back and get them. And the body too. I'll take your valise, Mr. Granger. My name's Weeks. Much obliged.That's my hotel over there. Usually full up, but I can take care of you now that Mr. Hawley's changing his room. Wrong... Hawley isn't changing his room, he checked out. No, he'll be occupying the downstairs rear. You see, I'm also Oaktown's undertaker. Having my establishment on the premises saves so many steps. Well, at least he'll be quiet. [PIANO PLAYING] I'm telling you, best white-faced herd west of the Mississippi. Yeah, west of the Mississippi. Hey, Saber, pull the cork out of that bottle and pour us another drink. See, honey, my wife just don't understand... The chump I'm with is a trifle sentimental. So he'll swap you this drink for something sad. How about if I remind him of his mother? From the looks of him, his old lady died laughing. [CHUCKLES] That was the finest wine cellar I've ever seen, before or since. We had the biggest heads I've ever seen before or since. We had to deflate them to get out of it. You should have seen us the next day. 12 hours late. Delivering the orders for the general to retreat. [LAUGHS] I was ready to step in front of a firing squad. DEL: Instead of that, we got promoted on the spot. It seems the old boy assembled his forces, decided to attack and won himself a big battle. And all the time we were in the middle of our fifteenth bottle of Chablis. [LAUGHTER] The stuff from which heroes are made. Those were the days. What's the matter with now? You're out of the cellar and up on the roof. Yeah, I guess you're right. Things were a little different a couple of years ago though. My total capital when I landed here... One silver dollar. I never can keep them myself. They break too easily. Not this one. I flipped it to see whether I'd eat and I lost. So I brought it right in there and in one minute, it had a twin brother. Three weeks later, the place was his. Del's always lucky. Are you? Not me. Every time I say heads, it comes up tails or stands on end. [DOOR OPENS] I've been looking all over town for you, Ann. Mr. Dennison, I'd like you to meet... It's one thing for you to go around with a man like this, but I never thought you'd be having dinner with him here. Please, Dad, not now. You're of age, Ann, but remember this... You're still my daughter. You're certainly not respecting my wishes. I want to, but you're being unreasonable. It isn't unreasonable for a man to resent finding his daughter in a cheap gambling house. Now look, Mr. Dennison, that door, which incidentally, you forgot to close, separates the reputable from the disreputable. The only thing that filters through the cracks is money. That's all you're interested in... Money. What's the difference, as long as I get it? Please, Del, you're only prolonging this. I'm sorry, Ann. Forgive me. Mr. Dennison, it doesn't matter what you think of me as a man, it's useless for you to try and come between your daughter and myself. If it'll make you feel any better, I've told Ann that I'm willing to give up The Silver Dollar and settle down to a life of raising cattle and little Stewarts. You see, Dad, I told you Del would stop gambling if I asked him. You can't just stop gambling, Ann, any more than you can stop breathing. Well, maybe I am being unfair to you. Must be some good in you for Ann to feel about you the way she does. That's more like it. Why don't you pull up a chair... Oh, Ross, I'm sorry! We didn't mean to subject you to a family scene. Yes, our chaperone tonight is your new telegrapher. Oh, you Granger? Yes, sir. Came in on the afternoon stage. How do you do? Your troubles are over. Ross isn't afraid of Comanches. Why should I be? I've never seen one. Well, I'm glad somebody isn't. I just came from the camp out there and the men are all threatening to quit. They won't quit, Dad. They think too much of you. Nevertheless, we keep on losing them. I'm afraid you're going to lose me too, Mr. Dennison, at least for this evening. I guess I was born tired and it's getting late. Thanks for the dinner, Del. Good night, Miss Ann. See you in the morning.Good night. All right. See you, Ross. WOMAN: Listen, Mister, your wife may not understand you, but I do, and I say fox furs first. What'll it be? Brandy. What happened to your face? Do you want to drink this brandy or wear it? Either way. But if I wear it, I'll take my change in teeth. Enjoy your dinner? Not much. Why not? Don't you go for charcoal-broiled Auld Lang Syne? Del's changed a lot in two years. So who hasn't? Life is a long walk. If it's through a flower garden, you come out smelling sweet. If it's in the gutter, well, you keep checking the mud on the soles of your shoes. He used to play it soft. I know, I've seen him under fire. Now he plays it tight and tense. It's the girl. He wants to keep her up in the fresh air and to do that, he's got to stand on his toes. When it was me, he could stand naturally. He could even sit down. I smell something burning. Could it be a torch? Maybe last year. This year I've got it down to the size of a match. Don't worry, Jessie, one day somebody'll come along and blow it out. Water! What? Water again? You'll be rusting your insides, man. Either this wood's getting harder or I'm losing my strength. 'Tis older you're getting, that's all the trouble is. You'll be long dead and buried before we're through the pass if you don't get a move on. MAN: Where'd that water boy go? Hey, Jerry, bring the water over here. Coming, Mr. Connors. [ARROW WHOOSHING] Comanches! Come on! [WHOOPING] I'm beginning to think there's something more behind these raids than Comanches. They've been hitting our equipment lately too... Jimmied switches, steam valves plugged up so the boilers explode. And they've been cutting the telephone wires... Putting them back together so the breaks are hard to find. That isn't Indian thinking! [GUNSHOT] Hold up a minute. What's the matter?Listen. [GUNSHOT] That sounds like it might be out at camp. [GUNSHOT] Sounds like a repeating rifle. That's impossible. There aren't any in this territory. Come on. Where's Connors? We're through, Mr. Dennison. We've got our families to think about. Yeah, when Indians come at us with repeating rifles, that's when I draw my pay. They don't manufacture them things themselves and they don't go back east to buy them. No, they don't. If you quit, I don't blame you. Where is Connors? [HORSE SNORTS] [TAPPING TELEGRAPH] This is the last, Stewart, and I'm sorry I ever listened to you. If you're gonna shed tears, here. I don't know why I was weak enough to let you talk me into it. Land, mortgages, auctions... If the railroad bypasses Oaktown, I'm ruined! Everything I've got is tied up in land too, except this. Don't worry, we're gonna make a killing. Those raids by Dark Thunder are really ringing the bell. The railroaders are in a panic. For every mile of track that's laid, a half mile's torn up. Yes. But I didn't know I was financing wholesale murder. What did you think the Comanches were gonna do with those rifles, hunt deer? Why don't you be honest with yourself, Broden? If the railroad could be forced to change its route and go through Oaktown, you won't care if every tie is a human body. You're pretty free with your mouth, Mr. Stewart. Your fists too. You know, Mr. Broden hires me to protect him from people. Why not? It's cheaper than having a conscience. Oh, let's not get excited. After yesterday's raids, I think Mr. Dennison will be willing to make a slight detour. You're a long ways from home. What do you want? That's a nice way to greet a future son-in-law. You're not married to her yet. I haven't got time to talk to you. I'm busy. You know, Mr. Dennison, you've built too many railroads. Your thinking's getting warped. You're beginning to believe that everything has to move in a straight line. I said I was busy. That's why you don't understand human beings, not even your own daughter. I don't understand what she sees in you, if that's what you mean. Ann's young. You keep trying to build a fence around her. I'm offering her a ladder. And every step on it is rotten. [CHUCKLES] Listen, Mr. Dennison, I didn't come down here to discuss personalities. I came down here because I'd hate to have to marry an orphan. Your passion for straight lines is leading you straight to the cemetery. Why do you insist on laying track right across a Comanche hunting ground? That's my business. You could go around that mountain, save a lot of your men and make Oaktown happy. I told you before, Stewart, I changed the original survey because the country around here is crisscrossed with gullies. Every spring, the floods would sweep out all of our trestles. Suppose you have to replace a few trestles now and then. That's better than battling Comanches. Besides, you'd have a better chance of defending yourself on level ground. Why are you so interested in switching the route? I'm not, personally. But there's a group in this district that is. They want the road to go into Oaktown because if it doesn't, the place'll become a ghost town. Listen, Stewart, Oaktown's of no interest to me. If it dies, as it might, and if the Comanches die as they might, and if I die, that doesn't change it. That's just the present. The railroad's the future. Mr. Dennison, I'm authorized to offer you $25,000 if you'll go back to your original survey. I don't take bribes, Stewart! And you can tell whoever sent you out here that I'm wiring the board of railroads in Washington to look into the matter. I'd think that over if I were you. I knew you were low, but how you could murder innocent men... Hold it, Dennison! I'm not in on this and neither are the people that I represent. Don't forget, Indians have no love for railroads. They're attacking you on their own. $25,000, that's a lot of money, Stewart. How much do they pay for repeating rifles? [GUNSHOT] Careful, Stewart, or I'll drop you. Why did you do that? I thought it was the fourth of July. He'd have seen the light. Just in case he didn't, I let a little through him. Another couple of raids and we'd have been building our own station. I handle Mr. Broden's interests in my own way. Handy, aren't they? [TELEGRAPH TAPPING] Hello. Hello, Ross. Have you seen my father? He's out surveying. I thought you were supposed to stay in town? I couldn't stand the hotel today. I guess I'm too squeamish. Mr. Weeks has all those bodies. Dead men can't hurt you. It's the live ones you have to watch. Are you implying something? I never imply on Tuesdays. Only Wednesdays and Saturdays. I get so tired of people telling me Del Stewart's no good for me. You're his friend. I thought you'd be different. Did I say anything? You're too sensitive. I'm sorry, Ross. Hold these. No, I don't believe in giving advice. The most interesting part of life is making mistakes. So you do think Del's a mistake. Now you're the one that's doing the thinking... For both of us. I'm sorry again. It's just that Dad can't get it through his head there's some things in life you can't control. If you're in love with someone you don't make conditions. Don't you? Of course not. Ross, do you think if a man's once been a gambler, he'll always be one? Depends on the gambler. None of my business, of course, but how did you get hooked up with one? Del says it was his silver dollar that brought us together. Offhand, I'd say a luck charm like that is worth having. [HORSE WHINNIES] [ANN SOBBING] "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, "He leadeth me beside the still waters, "He restoreth my soul. "He leadeth me on the paths of righteousness "for His name's sake. "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil "for Thou art with me. "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. "Thou annointest my head with oil. "My cup runneth over. "Surely goodness and mercy "shall follow me all the days of my life "and I will dwell in the house of the Lord "forever. "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." Whoa. We won't need you anymore, Charlie.All right, Mr. Stewart. I'd... Del, if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while. We understand. If there's anything you need... Just yell. I think we could both use a drink. Weeks' voice matches his profession. [SHUDDERS] Gives me the creeps. Yeah. You don't look so good, Sheriff. What's the matter, strain your credit? Anything else he has today is on the house. Thank you, Del. On my small salary... Oh, cut it out. You'll have me in tears. I'm glad you're here, Sheriff. I've got something to show both of you. Looks like an ordinary .45 slug to me. But that one's been places, through Dennison's spine, lungs and heart. I had Weeks dig it out for me. You're a gruesome one. What are you gonna do, wear it on your watch chain? Nope, return it to its owner. I don't get it. Dennison was killed by a white man. Comanches don't use pistols. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. Who'd want to kill poor old Mr. Dennison? About half the town. That takes in a lot of people. Which half? Well, I thought you could help me there, Sheriff. Who's been buying a lot of land lately? A speculator would stand to make plenty with Dennison out of the way and the road going through here. That's right. The sheriff'll look into it. And I'll keep both eyes open myself. See you later. So he's the telegrapher? Yep. Well, he just sent me a message. Yeah? He ain't no telegrapher. JESSIE: Through grieving? This office is private. It is, isn't it? Look, Jessie, we've been through for a long time. The fire's out, nothing left but ashes. Blow on them. Heh. Funerals do something to me. I look at that long black coffin, I think about clocks. They keep ticking and the hands keep moving. No one can hold them back. Did you ever consider how many minutes we waste? How many opportunities we pass up? I'll remind Ann. Well, you must be in love with her. Like I never was with you, Jessie. Are you sure? I remember when you started with me. It was all roses and conversation and blank verse. Of course it didn't last. Once the stove was lit... Del, why don't you face it? You could never love anybody but yourself. You're looking in the mirror, can't you see it? You're all flash... An empty bottle with so many cracks in it, it would never hold holy water. But it'll hold whiskey, Del. Why don't you forget the little princess and come back to the common herd? The only thing you find in a herd is cows. You are unwelcome in our hunting grounds. Your wisdom is the wisdom of the snake. Many braves have listened and perished. Some braves have died, but you still have your hunting grounds, Dark Thunder. The hunters are more to be valued than the hunting grounds. He who spoke those words was not Dark Thunder. Those were the words of a squaw. Then the squaw has wisdom. Only the madman beats his fist upon the rock which is of eternity. The railroad is not of eternity. The railroad already breaks under your blows. Soon it retreats to the south. Hear this, Dark Thunder, I have more new weapons for your braves. They will be given to you at the accustomed place. With them you will drive all white eyes from the mountain. It is well. Hyah! You shouldn't be here. I told you I'd come out and collect his things. I always hated this hat. He never bought a new one. It's funny... Now I'll never be able to throw it away. Why not? It's just a hat. Now get this straight. Your father was a good man and a hard worker. If he'd have lived, he'd have sliced right through those mountains to the ocean. But he died and you're preserving his hat, setting it up as some kind of shrine. He doesn't need that anymore. That's his shrine. And every time a train gets this far hauling passengers or freight it'll be your father that's making the delivery. Now I got a lot of work to do. Get back to town and stay there. I've talked to most of the men. They're a little ashamed of themselves. We'll start work in the morning. [HORSE GALLOPING] DEL: You sure had me worried. Whatever possessed you to ride out here alone? Does it matter? Of course it matters. You're very important to me. You're my whole future. My father was always talking about the future. He sacrificed everything for it... His comforts, his health, finally his life. Ann, you've simply got to pull yourself together. I'm trying to. The shock you've had will pass. Not here, I want to go away somewhere. I don't care, anywhere. I was gonna tell you tonight. That's a surprise. I'll tell you what... Why don't you give me a couple of weeks or a month to wind up my affairs and turn my place over to somebody else and I'll come along with you? No, Del. But you... Well, you can't go alone. Why not? I am alone. Inside, we're all alone. That's not true. You're just upset. Look, Del, why can't we be honest with each other? How deep do our feelings actually go? I want to marry you, Ann. But how deep are your feelings? You sure that you didn't bury them with your father? [TELEGRAPH TAPPING] What did you do, train your horse to tiptoe? I thought it was about time we have a little talk, Granger. That's right neighborly of you. Let's step out on the terrace. Well, I'm listening. Hot today, isn't it? You didn't ride 10 miles to tell me that. Not exactly, no. For a man that thinks it's time for a little talk, you're certainly not very talkative. I don't know where to begin. Try the beginning. Look, Granger, I think you know what I'm gonna say so why make it any tougher on me? I gotta get something off my back. It's been riding there quite a while. If your conscience is bothering you, Blaney, why come to me? I'm a telegrapher, not a chaplain. The way I see it, you ain't either one. I pegged you pretty quick. You're a railroad agent. All us lawmen smell alike. I hope not. It's like this, Granger, I'm an old man. Peace officers get scared and they get hungry. Pick them up off the ground dead every day, the only thing that comes out of their pockets is pennies. You know what I mean. Overtures bore me. If this is gonna be an opera, sing. I just wanted to explain why I'm setting still for it. When I found out about it a year ago... Well, I always had my eye on a small ranch. Nothing big, you understand, just a few head. How do the rifles come in? In whiskey barrels. Yeah, that's right, in whiskey barrels. You remember the other day when you rolled them barrels off of the stage? I pretty near had a heart attack. If they'd have broken open, Jenks would have had to kill you. And probably Jessie. Well, I've been doing a little checking... The bank and the land office. I spotted you right away and a cattleman named Broden. You've been speculating heavily in acreage. [SIGHS] The third party I thought was coincidence. Whiskey barrels. Why kid myself? There's only one saloon in town and Stewart owns that one. You want me to show you the place where the Comanches get the rifles? Deer probably. Don't blame you for being jumpy. Never could come through here without looking back. Great place for an ambush. Yeah, come to think of it. Well, now we're stopped, might as well have a smoke. We got a long ride for ourselves. You can smoke later. Take it easy, friend. You don't think I'm leading you anywhere you ain't coming back from, do you? Nobody could take a shot at you here without getting me. I said smoke later! Take it calm. Why, I'd have to drive my heels into this old haybag to give whoever it was a clear shot. Like this! Granger? [ECHOING] GUNMAN: Granger? How bad you hit? I'm dead. [GUNSHOT] We don't want to kill ya. Throw out your gun and we'll talk. Like you did with Dennison? It's a pretty rough conversation. [GUNSHOT] That the best you can do, Blaney? Some sheriff. All that lard you're packing around... You're gonna be my favorite target. GUNMAN: Granger, don't be a fool. Throw out your gun. Why do you want to die for the railroad company? They never gave anybody anything. After 25 years you'll get a pat on the back and a gold watch. All right. There's my gun. Come on up and help me. I'm bleeding bad. Well, fancy that. You must have a lot of faith in human nature, friend. Our company don't even give fake watches. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] BLANEY: All right, Granger, I hate to do it, but I ain't got no choice. Pull it. It won't go off by itself. I'll give you a minute. You may want to pray. Pull it! Having trouble, aren't you, Blaney? But I know your kind. You'll pull that trigger even if it takes all day. And afterwards you'll go over behind the rocks and vomit. And you'll hate yourself even worse than you do now. But it'll stick with you. And your wife... She'll wonder what's wrong with you. But you won't be able to tell her. And every day this'll happen... Over again. Shut up, Granger. Pray. For you, this is it. I'm gonna put out your lights in a second. It takes nerve to shoot an unarmed man, Blaney. [LABORED BREATHING] I'm beginning to think it's a toss-up... Whether you're even a man. Pull it. Dear me, I'm getting quite good at this. That only took about five minutes. When he comes to, will you tell him he owes me 50 cents? You think he'll be all right? Oh, of course. He's lost a great deal of blood, but he's built like a ton of bricks. Well, I must run, ladies. The Sheriff caught me in the middle of a fascinating autopsy. I wonder who did it. I couldn't get anything out of old fat stuff. He just brought him in, laid him down and went out again. Fine sheriff we got. He looked sicker than Ross. I think he's coming to. You mustn't move. Maybe I won't have to. Where's Stewart? He'll be in. You stay put. You've been through the mill, friend. Ross, you've got to tell us what happened. The sheriff wouldn't spill a thing. The man who shot your father was Jason. A little while ago I killed him. How are ya feeling, Ross? You're under arrest, Stewart. What's the matter with him? Has loss of blood affected his mind? I don't know. I wasn't sent out here just to tap out telegraph messages. I came to check on the Indian raids. Something about them didn't add up to feathers. Del here's been needling the local tribes then supplying them with repeating rifles. Really, this is getting too rich for my blood. Del's a gambler and I have an idea that his wheel in there is educated. But he's no renegade and he don't mix in murder. All right, baby, thanks for the references. And for your information, the wheel is honest. Time you got back to work. What would be his percentage? Comanches pay off in dried toads or something. Beat it, Jessie. Ross, please, I don't understand any of this. That makes two of us. All right, then I'll tell you. Del, Jason, Broden and the Sheriff were all in on a big land swindle. Get the railroad to come into town and triple their price. The rifles he was giving the Comanches, they were coming in in whiskey barrels. Let's go to your warehouse, Stewart, I want to see those whiskey barrels. Why not? Let's humor the mad man. Afterward, we'll have dinner. Uh, you better put on your shirt. You know, Ann, I'd find this whole thing more amusing if you weren't taking it seriously. I'm sorry, Del. Frankly, I don't know what to think. Do you think I'm capable of a thing like that? Yes. Open the door, Del. Let's not turn this into a debate. This is it. You'll find the whiskey in the whiskey barrels, the beer in the beer barrels. And when you've satisfied yourself, I'll expect an apology. I'll expect an apology from you too. What's got into you? I don't know. Del, I'm sorry for what I said. I had such a strange feeling all of a sudden. [HAMMERING] Oh, it's the shock, dear. You haven't been the same since your father died. Ann, let's stop all this foolishness. I'll get Weeks to marry us in the morning and we'll go back east for a couple of months. No, Del. Well, why not? Just no. Surely you don't believe all this? I don't love you, Del. The whiskey barrels are full of whiskey and the beer barrels are full of beer. Lock the door when you're finished. And when you're ready to apologize, you know where to find me. I made a mistake. Have you? No. We still have one whiskey barrel to check. Come on. They made sure the last whiskey barrel was empty. I don't have to ask you why you've come back. In spite of the way you felt about Connors and my dad, I know that's not the reason. After taking my dad to the cemetery, I made up my mind to leave here. Now I'm ashamed of it. Everything he wanted, everything he worked so hard for, everything he was is right here and lies unfinished. What you are, what you've worked for is right here too, and that's why you've come back. I know that every foot of track has meant suffering for somebody. But when the work's done, these same tracks will bring your wives and your children to you and your food and your goods. [WAGON APPROACHING] And then you'll know you haven't just built a railroad, but that you've built your future. ROSS: You heard what the lady said. Let's get the job finished. Each man'll draw a gun and keep it near him at all times. We're gonna push those tracks right through that mountain pass and no man red or white is going to stop us. We'll go along with you on that, Ross. Come on, let's get started. What are we waiting for?MAN: Just a minute. Just a minute! None of you know me, but my name is Perkins, and I happen to be your new chief of construction. These are my credentials if anyone wishes to examine them. [MUTTERING] I've been given explicit orders by the company to abandon the present route through Boulder Pass. Economically, the entire project has been a complete failure. Men have been attacked by Indians, valuable equipment has been sabotaged, and time has been lost. This is what we're going to do. We're going to rip up all of the track this side of the crossroad and swing around so as to pass through Oaktown. I'm afraid there's no more champagne, Mr. Stewart. There must be. You just didn't look in the right place. Where would that be? A party came in here last night and drank six bottles of it. There's some behind the bar. That party last night... After the third bottle, they was drinking sauterne. [LAUGHTER]Well, they had a good time. Say, but what are we celebrating today? Leap year? Christmas, honey. Santa Claus came down the chimney. Yeah, and he's gonna fill our stockings right to the top. Of course we'll have to give Santa a little kickback. I don't get it. Never mind, baby, there'll be a candy cane in it for you. What's keeping him so long? You don't suppose there's gonna be any trouble, do you? Relax, you'll live longer. There he is now. There was no argument? You can pour me a glass. The occasion is appropriate. We begin ripping up the track tomorrow and by this time next week, Oaktown will have a railroad. That noise you heard was me quitting my bartending job. Yeah, but what about the Comanches? You're gonna have to ride out and call them off. You know what you can do with that candy cane? Give it back to Santa Claus. You fool! Saddle my horse and meet me out front. Take your hands off me or I'll have to take another bath. Jessie, honey, what you heard, you're drawing the wrong conclusions. I'll bet. Come on into my office. I'll explain everything. I don't like being pushed. And I'll save you the trouble of thinking up lies. Everything Granger said about you was true. It adds up. So? Stop adding. Close your little bookkeeping mind. It's too neat. It doesn't go with the rest of you. I'm through with Ann, baby. She's a puritan. She creaks when she walks. I'm not interested in her habits. For all I care she can have morals that stretch like rubber bands. You're wasting time. The furnace is stone cold. It won't work, Del. Not anymore. You've played me for a sucker for the last time. I always knew you were a louse, but it didn't matter. I loved you. And the pity of it is way down deep inside, I guess I always will. Jessie, it's not like you to be squeamish about things. You've been around long enough to know that when big money's involved people are bound to get hurt. Why don't you forget about the whole thing, baby? Would it help your feelings any if I asked you to marry me? I waited a long time to hear you say that. But I'll tell you again, Del. I guess you didn't hear. You're wasting time and you haven't got much of it left. What do you mean? You're sick and the only cure for that is hanging. I'm going to turn you in, Del. Don't make me laugh. You won't. You mean... You won't, Jessie, ever again. [GUNSHOT] [PLAYING LOUDER] Mr. Perkins, you've had a long trip today, you better go back to the hotel and rest. We don't want anything to happen to you. Everything all right? Certainly. Come with me. Jess, for the love of... I'll let you know later, chum. I'll send you a postcard if I get there. I'll get old Weeks. He'll fix you up right away. Not unless he's been hoarding spare parts. Listen, Gus, do me a favor, will you? Sure, Jess, anything. You name it. You know this guy Granger? The telegraph fella? Yeah. Ride out there in the railroad camp and... And tell him that... Tell him that... Yeah, Jessie? Tell him what? That new boss, Perkins, is in Del's pocket. All right, I'll tell him. I'll tell him right away. Now can I get Weeks? Yeah, but make sure he brings his shovel. All right, this'll be spit in the ocean. I'd rather spit in my hands and get to work. How long do we aim to wait? Till we get an answer to Granger's message. The time they're taking, they could deliver it in person. Ross? Yeah? What'll you do when the answer comes, if they back Perkins? I don't know. Nothing, I guess. The decision isn't up to me. Nobody's going to tell me to lay off of Stewart. I'm the one who should be bitter. Strange, but... I can't even remember what it was I felt for him. Oh, I remember, but it's as if it happened to someone else... A stranger. At least you're not confused. If I were a father, I'd chain my daughters in the cellar until they were 30. [LAUGHS] And your sons? Don't be silly. How could I have any sons? I'm not married. Ross? Yeah? I wondered if you were. If I were what? Married. If that message doesn't come soon, the only safe place for me will be out with the Comanches. [HORSE GALLOPING] Whoa. I don't see why I had to come along. You were doing very nicely with the Comanches by yourself. Exactly. Yes, but I don't get it. Well, it's simple, Broden. Not that I anticipate any trouble, but if there's ever any inquiry about secret dealings with the Indians, I won't be the only goat. Keep calm. And if you want to live, for the love of Mike, don't reach for a gun. I seek Dark Thunder. Why is he not here? [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] What'd he say? I don't know. Lead us to Dark Thunder! Let's go. I guess I'm the only one they'll let through. Relax, I'll be back as soon as I can. Relax? The white eye is unwelcome here. Does he bring rifles? He brings something better. He brings Dark Thunder good news. When he comes, he's always accompanied by death. Not this time. I come to tell you the railroad is broken. It retreats from your territory. There will be no more death among your people. The white eye speaks with the tongue of the crow... Noise which means nothing. The railroad at this moment approaches the sacred hill where my firstborn is buried. The attack must begin at once. And it is my command that every white eye will die. I make no exceptions. What you say isn't possible. The order to tear up the track has already been given. Come! Look! There must be some mistake. Every white eye will die. Surely not those who have come to you in peace? Myself, my friends? [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Your friends are already dead. You, I will kill myself... After you have watched every white eye die. MAN: Look, Comanches! [WHOOPING] [YELLING] I've got to get you to a safe place. Come on. There isn't any safe place. Anyway, I'm staying with you. O'Brian, McGruder, come on. [WHOOPING] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Give up, Stewart. Maybe a lawyer could prove you did all this in your sleep. All right. Take me. Del? Yeah? Hardest thing I ever had to do. I kept remembering that wine cellar in Virginia. Found this on the ground. Is it yours? ROSS: No, it was his. Keep it. It won't help him where he's going.
