Produced by The Leningrad Order of Lenin Film Studio Lenfilm and the Bulgarian Film Studio Bolgarfilm For five centuries the Slavs of the Balkan peninsula suffered under the yoke of the Ottoman Turks who invaded Europe in 1352. Time after time, the Balkan peoples rose up against their oppressors. In 1876-1877 a massive revolt seized the entire peninsula. In April of 1876 the heroic Bulgarian people rebelled against their enslavers. The Turkish administration cruelly quelled the rebellion, drowning it in the blood of Bulgarian patriots. Return brothers! - Do you submit to the will of the Pasha? - No! - And you, do you submit to the will of the Pasha? - No! Do you submit to the will of the Pasha? And you old man, do you submit to the will of the Pasha? - Do you submit to the will of the Pasha? - No! Don't surrender! Don't surrender, brothers! We will avenge you brothers! Ah! These people have died in vain! All haven't died in vain! Russia will help us! To Sichke, our sheperd. Levskii, Bunkovskii, Khristubofer. Holy Savyarloliptuna! Russia! Russia herself! Russia! Russia! Russia herself! Officially, Europe has covered its ears to avoid hearing the desperate cries of the sufferers in the East. But Russia hears them! And she will not remain heartless! It is impossible to remain silent any longer! It is our duty to come to the aid of our suffering Slavic brothers! Get down. Get down, Garshin. The professor has agreed to speak. Pirogov. That is his name. Never before, has a single government until now, gone to war with such a clear conscience with such deep conviction of the righteousness of the mission as Russia in this moment! -Truly! Russia draws her sword, lofty feelings of humanitarianism advancing her forward! Well then, will there be a war, gentlemen? Well, how would I know, my dear? There, ask Prince Mirsky. Everything is in the hands of God, Madam. Tell me, Olga Nikolayevna is it true that your son, General Skobelev, the hero of Turkestan, is setting off for Kishinev? - Misha is simply moving to different climate. - Don't reproach me. Climate, climate. Turkestan and Kushinev have practically the same climate. Who is that with Milyutin? Prince Gorchakov. How old he has gotten. My goodness, what time does to people. Oh, yes. So, Prince, do you believe that people in Bucharest are in agreement? In Romania, people are well aware that their independence depends on friendship with Russia. Very good! So, our troops will be able to reach the Danube unimpeded. - You are heading off to his majesty? -Yes, yes. He has already inquired about you. War has not been declared yet. But we must all be ready, gentlemen. And who do you expect to be chosen as the Commanders dear Dmitri Alekseevich? I am only the Minister of War, General Gurkov. I propose and he disposesā As is well known, I suggested General Obruchev. But His Majesty prefers his brother. Nikolai Nikolayevich? I need a disciplined person to be chief of staff completely obedient. Yes, exacting and conscientious. I would recommend you, my dear General Nepokoichitskii. Artur Adamovich is a very courteous and obliging person. Yes. Well, there, a career is made. I congratulate you, Artur Adamovich, from the bottom of my heart. I am very happy for you. I would consider it an honor to serve under your leadership. Shhh. His Majesty. Tell me, Alexander Mikhailovich if we go to the aide of our fellow Slavs and thereby will we satisfy the wish of our people and will we ease this tense and stormy atmosphere within our country? Stormā atmosphereā Perhaps, we should ask physicists, Your Highness? Don't joke Aleksandr Mikhailovich. I want to ask your advice. If we begin this war and intercede on behalf of the Bulgarians what will the mood be like inside the country? My duties as chancellor are foreign affairs, Your Highness. Very well. Then tell me how will the international situation go for us? We cannot repeat 1854. The world is waiting for our word, Count. The word of Germany. The word of Bismarck. Russia helped Germany. During the most difficult moments of the battle for national unity. We are indeed indebted to Russia. And we will not hinder her. We will not interfere between Russia and Turkey. Aha, so. But Austria, what will Andrassy do? We have promised Russia neutrality in the event of war. In exchange, Austria will receive Bosnia and Herezegovina without firing a single shot. But, what if Russia wants to become the heiress of Turkey on the Balkan peninsula? If that should happen, God save England. And Disraeli. Ahh, Solmsbary. Charming, this country. You and Elliot Konstantinopli were splendid. I know everything! There is only one thing you don't know, sir. I have brought you a proposition from Count Andrassy to form an alliance. In the event that you will need to cool Russiaā it's zeal. Wonderful news, sir. Why are you so gloomy, Lord Berg. This news doesn't make you happy? A different piece of news wasn't so wonderful, sir. The Russian diplomatic official was in Bucharest under the full authority of Chancellor Gorchakov. - However, the old man isn't wasting time. - If Nelidov obtains Romania's permission for Russian troops to pass through. Then we must help the Turks meet them on the Danube. Ahhh, Nikolai, this is a subject worthy of the brush of an artist. You know, Nikolai. The artist Vereshagin is asking to join the army. He is an excellent artist botanist, your excellency. You overpraise. He can't paint this type of painting. And all those soldiers with their foot wraps, he can. Yes, he can, he can. He was in Turkestan, he painted, pretty well. Let him go. Yes, by the way, what about Skobeleva? We are probably transferring him from Turkestan. And where do we transfer him? He commanded the army, your excellency. By accident, by accident. Well, he distinguished himself there in Central Asia. With his youth and bravery. But, he still must earn some type of medal. - And that Skobelev, Skobelev. - In that case we need to consider the international situation. Isn't it true, Aleksandr Mikhailovich? Well, Skobelev captured several English officers there in Turkestan. Well, they were helping the other side. And Skobelev treated them very harshly. Very harshly. Well, you know England is very offended. We have to send him somewhere less conspicuous. Where will you have him sent, your majesty? Maybe to the Bulgarian volunteer army? --No, no. Milyutin has invited General Stoletov to join the Bulgarian volunteers. Yes, well he knows the Eastern languages. He is a very skilled general. And very cultured. Good. Then we will send Stoletov to the Bulgarians. And of course, we must make use of the Bulgarians. But only in a supportive capacity. In Bulgaria there is a very strong spirit of national opposition, your excellency. We could create a good Bulgarian army out of volunteers. 2-3 divisions. Bulgarian revolutionaries will use these divisions. Don't forget the most important thing. We must bring Bulgarians freedom from the Turks, but not a revolution. Well, Nikolai, Godspeed. Take care. Look after him, Nipokoichitskii. They sing well. From the heart. They sound like our songs from the Kuban, very melancholic. They have lived under the Turkish yoke for a thousand years, Russia also suffered under the Tatar yoke. These songs are as bitter as wormwood. Girech, that means Bulgarians are very similar to us. - Uncle Makar! -Yes? -I can learn their language in no time! -Oh, you can? -And so? And they are our brothers in faith. During the morning exercises they were singing the Our Father, exactly the same. Well, except this word of theirs- bratushki. It means relatives. Yes, you had to suffer terribly under the Turks, if you left your native land. Lie! That's a lie! The Turks of the forests are the kin of nightmares! Judging from the scale this is a rebellion. Let it be that not one of your friends falls into the hands of these sheep. [Rants in Bulgarian] For that reason our vow is: Freedom or death! Freedom or death! Did you hear that, Znobishek? Freedom or death. These words are good to hear. Well, it may be necessary for us to die. True, not for our but for your people. And after all, for freedom. Well, Stepan show our Ryazan the dance, so that the Turks on the other side feel the earth tremble. With much pleasure, your excellency! - Only, somebody accompany me on the accordion. - I can do it. Wonderful, old man. So, what about these dances then, eh? -The Horo, cousin. Horo. -Horo? -Strange. -What's strange? They call it the Horoā we call it the horovod. Is it clear? Do you understand? Make way! Ryazan is here! What are you writing about? In every word of these Russian songsā you can hear the longing for heroic feats on the battlefieldā the thirst for glory and the peasant's proclamations of faithfulness to Godā - to the emperor and the empire. -Rubbish! Tell me, how many divisions, both infantry and cavalry, have the Russians concentrated around the Danube? Oh, I have that here. First of all, for the censor. Now... Currently, on the left bank of the Danube, the Russians have... concentrated about seven divisions estimating by the 285 000 of people. And there are 12,000 from the Romanian corps. This information is accurate? Thank God the Russians still have real gentlemen among them. They don't refuse to give information to foreign correspondents. And the date? The most important thing is, when will they conduct a forced crossing of the Danube? Yes, to hell with it. It's the only I wasn't able to ascertain. Crossing the Danube must take place only in complete secrecy. We can only count on success under those conditions. And we have some foreigners walking around our camps. Those are war correspondents, Fyodor Fyodorovich. The Englishman Taker and the American Drimā commanded to visit us by the mandate of Nipokoichitskii himself. Don't allow them in. Refusing them entry is not allowed. -Courtesy between nations. -Well, to hell with courtesy! Let them think us to be the boors than the idiots. Just don't let them in. That's right. The order will be carried out, Pyotr Petrovich. And do you know what will be done with Mikhail Dmitriyevich Skobelev? They sent him to his father. In the division. He has been bound, you might say, by the hands and feet. And he could have been of service to us here. - Pleasant speech is pleasant to hear. -Well now, speak of the devil. I'm happy, my good man. So happy to see you. And you, Vasilii Vasilyevich, in what capacity are you here? And you, artist, are here with us to endure the dirt and suffering of soldiers? You won't see the dirt and suffering from a room in a hotel, Mikhail Dmitriyevich. Well, it's humiliating to sit at home during this sort of war. - All of Russia is agitated over this war. -That which is the truth is true. During your trip here, in Moscow, Kharkov and Kiev there is no end of volunteers for the army. Well, I have come to you as a volunteer. Will you accept me, Mikhail Ivanovich? I ask you humbly. I feel the strength of my conviction. Well, the strength I see, but how will we outsmart the Turks and skip over the Dunabe, eh? Apparently you have been appointed to your father's division. Under his supervision. I will tell you in confidence, that I ran away from father's division. -For good? - Were you put in command of a division? -Yes, I was. Nothing. Nothing. I just ran away from his watchful eye. - It doesn't matter, your father will hunt you down. - Please Lord not that. My old man is reserved and cautious. You will not receive the cross in his division, brother. - Will you go to war because of these crosses, Mikhail Dmitriyevich? -And what of it? Well, fasten it on, Gregorii, and be proud. Everything is in order. You immediately see the eagle. What Russian artist has Gregori's talent? Or had? I can't think of one. And there, Vasillii Vasillyevich Vereshagin wears the George cross. - Listening to you, it is as if you are some sort of careerist. -And so? In a good way, yes. Do you know the Russian proverb? A cross on your chest or a cross in the ground. So, Mikhail Ivanovich? Will you accept me? Well, only as an orderly. I will consider it a great honor, Mikhail Dmitriyevich. Will you allow it? Mikhail Ivanovich, I recommend these... Bulgarian patriots... about whom we spoke with you. They have agreed to carry out your instructions. Do you think they see the signal, the Russians? Ivan will sent the troops. It is a good moment. Whatever they are going to do, - Bulgaria will be free. - Just wait. Good job, Bulgarians. One may count on them. Well, Mikhail Ivanovich, we can begin the crossing in that direction. At the signal. Go with God. Go with God. Sashko. Rukmaser. Listen, old boy. Do watermelons grow in Bulgaria? Who? Watermelons. Help! Help! Djambu! Djambu! Gau! Gau! Help! Stop. God, please save us. - Please God, let it not hit us. -Don't be a coward. They won't kill idiots. Well, brothers, onward whoever doesn't fear death! It fell short. Look out! Look out! Follow me, brothers! Go! Go, follow me! Go! Fire the cannon into the depths, old chap. My god! Old chap, hit that infidel for me please. - Let the devils take you! -Amen. - Let's go! - I'm going already. Minzar, get going. -Finish the bazaar. Hands up! -Surrender, or else we'll cut you down! Good day to you, Mikhail Ivanovich. - A miracle, the blind sees, no? -Our soldiers did well, Mikhail Dmitriyevich. I would have kissed them all, one by one. We forced a difficult crossing over that stream. Thank you to our Generals, Dragomirov and Skobelev. - Thank you. -And what, already? Of course. And thank them as well. Ahh. -Yes, yes, yes. War is such a difficult business, brothers. This war is easy for the heart. We are liberating our brothers. Blood was spilled here for a good cause. But when death comes to take you, then they will pray for you many times. Everyone will have an entry in the commemoration book. And the bullets are good and the sabre is good. All right? All right. [in Bulgarian accent] Pasha behaves brutally. They take revenge on the Bulgarians because of us. Ah, these Bulgarians are so unlucky. The infidels will burn down their cities. -Give them sabres, your highness. -Your highness. Follow me! Ahead! Wow, what a girl! Where did you came from, so beautiful? A Russian. Look. See the Russian. Oh. Saintly man. Saintly? Hmm! What are you saying? A Saint is inscribed in a holy place. Oh, god! And you won't end up in paradise, Sashko Kozir. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Everything disturbs me from going to heaven. Oh! Bulgarian brothers. From far-away Russia, the citizens of Samara have sent you, the Bulgarian soldiers, A holy banner. A symbol of friendship between the Russian and Bulgarian peoples. And their unity through blood. IN BULGARIAN: Let this banner, Bulgarian: Be the banner of victory over the enemy. Let this banner be the symbol of freedom of Slavs from the Turkish yoke. I congratulate you with this banner, brothers Bulgarians! Hurray! Brothers, May God help us carry the banner from village to village, every mile, across Bulgarian land. We will defeat all evil enemies And peace and well-being will come. we swear We swear with this banner We will die but fulfill our duty Swear! We swear We swear! Ambassador of her Majesty Queen of Great Britain, Lord Henry Eliot What do I hear, Your Majesty? Is this true? You have decided to go to Asia? What else to be done? The Russians suddently overtook Shipka. The road to Istanbul is open. -What can we do? - I would not dare advise your Majesty. But if it were I who had to decide I would have immediately called for Pasha Suleiman from Montenegro... and all his 30 000 army, experienced in battles. I would have put them to fight against general Gurkov. I would order Asman-pasha to move from Viden to Shipka from the north. And to Suleiman-pasha, to attack from the south, sparing no life. Pity nobody, and seize again the Balkan passage. And throw off the Russians back to the Danube. Yes, yes, yes. Spare no life Pity no blood Our Suleman will receive this advise, sir. You always help our empire at the most difficult moments. "20 July 1877 right team of Russian troops met unexpectedly under Plevna the army of Asman Pashi that was stelthily marching from Viden The threat of the enemy's attack checked Russian movement towards the south. They concentrated the main forces of Russian and Rumanian armies near Plevna, leaving a weak rear guard at Shipka passage. At the same time, the army of Suleiman hurried from Montenegro. It appeared in the valley Kazandyk on 8 August and approached Shipka with a goal to capture the passage. The attack has failed again. It was our seventh attack, Sardari-krem. In the name of Allah, Sardari-krem. Give us 4 battalions from the reserve and we'll sweep them off. -I swear, Pasha. - What? To defeat a douzen of "dogs" you would need thousands? They are strong as cliffs. They are like eagles in their nest. And the solders of Pasha are chickens? The enemy is courageous and strong, Sardari-krem. Dog's heart! "I report, that all corpus of Suleiman-pashi which we can clearly see, is preparing the attack in 8 miles from Shipka" The enemy is powerful" And I don't exeggerate." "We'll resist to the last breath, but a back up... is very much needed" Call me the Cossak. -Are your from Shipka? - Yes, Your Excellency. -Have you seen the Turks? - They've covered the entire steppe. They've covered the steppe? Can you be more precise? 5 thousand? How? All 50 thousand, Your Excellence. All right, go. Yes. This looks serious. Shipka is practically open. Stoletov is left with only 6 Bulgarian brigades ... plus our Orlov's regiment... - but not entire regiment. - Bryansk regiment was sent there. One regiment? Against tens of thousand of Suleiman's troops? As you know, all forces as indicated by His Majesty... - Are sent to Plevna. - Moreover. We must block Suleiman at Shipka. Or else all our army will be between the two poweful enemy armies. - No. I cannot. I must... - Quieter, General. - Why are you so upset? - There is a battle their, Your Excellency. OK. I will report to his Majesty. As if his own estate is on fire. What strange people are Russians. May I, the unworthy one... - disturb your noble thoughts, Ogaza. - What do you want to say, Hassan? Bad news, Ogazy. The Russians are getting reinforcements. We know for certain. We received this information from our friends -- the English. - Directly from the Russian headquarter. - What kind of reinsforcement? -Who is the General? - Nizamporetsky and Dragomirov, Pasha. Use all our forces and reserves! Immediately! Hey, groom, there is your girl with the dark eyes. - Where? - There. Your Excellency, you must have something to eat! - Leave me alone. - Nikolai Grigorievich. Look, she comes the third time. Aren't you afraid? I must not be afraid. So, soldiers? Is this hard? It's hard, Your Excellency. - Yes. Only young men like yourselves can handle this. And against all odds, we will handle this. What do you think, will we resist the enemy? If you order it, we will resist, Your Excellency. And on your own, without an order? Without an order is a bit hard, Your Excellency. But we will resist. - We cannot give in Shipka, Your Excellency. - Of course. With all our force. Until the last soldier... But we won't give it in. - Talaro? - Takaz. - Right? - Right, Your Excellency. Your Excellency, will you eat anything please? He is stuck to me, isn't he? - All right. - Here. Much better, Nikolai Grigorievich. You've only eaten twice in three days! Here we go. What can you say? Won't give a person a moment to eat? Š Dammed mussulmans! - What's up with you, Timophei? - I feel the heroic spirit, Your Excellency. I want to spill the muslim blood, if needs be, and my own. - Allow me to join the battle. - Go. I love you even more like this, Boyana. You have never told me that you love me. Don't be silly. Don't you know the orders? - But the enemy is coming, shooting at us. - Shooting. They got foreign ammunition, the English one. They can afford to shoot. We have our own ammunition. Use your brain. Faster, fellows. Faster. - They are dying there at Shipka. Hurry - Yes, we hurry. - No bullets are left! - What are you screaming for? I know. Good. We'll deal without them. Let's go. Like this. You will pay for our laubors in afterlife. Soldiers. Russian fellows. There under the mountain. Let's go, darling. Let's go. Oi, uncle, Orlov's devision will give up Shipka, won't it? No, it won't. Stop being negative. Hurry up. Your Supreme Excellency! General Stoletov sent us to have infantry ride with us. Troops! Come closer, come! But not all at once! One by one! - Stronger, infantry! - Faster. We are from the Dragomirov's regiment. We've seen a lot. Go! Hang on, fellows! Reinforcement is coming! Hurray!!! Don't be afraid, miss. I'll show you, Turk! Now you know Russia. Whom are you looking for, uncle? For a friend. Not a friend. A Bulgarian soldier. Are you alive, friend? Alive. Alive, bugger. Pete. Pete! Alive! Alive. Alive. Alive. Pete was fighting heroically. And now we are blood brothers with him. Ionochka, why your mountain flowers do not smell? What are you saying. Wonderful smell. Yes, stale. ["Wonderful" in Bulgarian sounds as "stale" in Russian] - It makes my head spin. - You are joking. I am a unhappy man. Why this happens to me? - May I kiss you? - Hmm. - You won't go to paradise, Sasha. - No. - You don't want? - No. - You are saying yes. - I am saying no. But with your head, you are nodding "yes". Oi. For Russians it means "yes". In Bulgarian "no". This is "yes". "yes"? So, when I nod, it's a "no". - No? - No? And like this "yes"? - No. Yes. - Incredible. Do you know, Ionna, what I was thinking during the battle? Thinking? - Thinking. - All right, if you say it this way. We will free our fellows Bulgarians from Muslim yoke. And I, Sashko Kozyr, will take you with me, Ionochka. Take you with me, on a horse, and steal you to Kuban'. We have a river there, my Ionochka. A beautiful river. - Have you seen the Danube? - No. And the people! What people! There is no other people like that anywhere. ŠYou will become from Brukhovetskaya! Š No, Sashko! I don't want to. - That means no. - No. - Yes? - No. - But that's "yes" in Bulgarian. No. I was doing it in Russian. - In Russian means "no"? - No. - That's a "yes" in Russian. - No. - We got it all mixed up, in two tongues? Tell me, mate, where can I find General Radetsky? General Rodetsky? He is right here. Behind the hill. It's not funny. He did not pass, Suleiman. Tripped. - Over a Russian soldier tripped. - Don't forget the regiment soldiers. Some of them did not believe we'll make it. Wonderful people. Wonderful fighters... - These Bulgarian soldiers. - So. - Yes? If we must fight again, shoulder to shoulder, we can rely on them. And how are things under Plevna, Vasily Vasil'evich? Bad. We've attacked twice, unsuccessfully. With a huge loss. But I have a letter for you, Mikhail Ivanovich. From Mikhaila Dmitrievich Skobeleva.. - From Mikhaila Dmitrievich? - Yes. That's great! I love him. Mikhail Ivanovich, if it is not a secret, what's the white general saying? Ak-Pasha? The Turks call him that way. Ak-Pasha writes that headquarter rats want to turn battle into a theater under Poltava. To assaile Plevna. in honer of the namesday of his Majesty the Emperor. They have no conscience. Skobelev? It is not noon yet, The attack is scheduled for 3 pm sharp. Why is there a shooting? Artillary salutes your angel, in honour of your namesday, Alexandre. Punish the one who is responsible. Hurray!!! Climb, Karatyuk. Hold. - Hurray!!! - Hurray!!! Forward, fellows! Merrier! Merrier, merrier, fellows! Dukmasov! We've made it! We have taken it! Dukmasov, ride to the headquaters! Ask for reinforcement! A bit and and we will reach Plevna! - Yes, sir! - Hurry, mate! Your Excellency Skobelev won counterattack and is attacking. General Skobelev asks for reinforcement and and bring in some troops from the wing. Congratulate the General with his success. We'll do what we can. Your Excellency What regiment can we give to Skobelev? No regiement. We have our own dispositions. Not Skobelev's. We'll proceed the battle according the established disposition. Turks will begin counter-attack soon.. I see. I recognise Nepokoichitskogo. He is punctual. He has started the assail at 3 pm. How punctual. We'll get reinforcement and... What did he say? How many? He did not say how many. I don't need a lot of reinforcements. Two regiments, and we will from here... Osman is over. Yes...? The general assail of the Muscovites has failed at every point of attack. Mercy of Allah. But I cannot celebrate victory. Ak-pasha [Russian general] is in the heart of our troops. He is hanging over Plevna. If the Russians move into this direction. We would have to flee shamefully on the road to Sofia. He has such a happy face. Must be good news. - Are you from there? - Yes. - Straight from there, Your Excellency. - So tell us, tell us. We failed in the assail, Your Majesty. Russians and Roumanians fought like lions. But Turks resisted all of the attacks. Huge loss, Your Majesty. Heaps of the dead bodies. Irraparable misfortune! Skobolev is near Plevna, Your Majesty. I think we should support him. To the devil! I don't want to hear about Skobolev. It looks like a false popularity. Should we signal an end, Your Majesty? Yes, yes. Do we need extra loss? Ak-pasha will be alone. Our friend in the Russian headquarters has told us. Move some troops from other parts and throw them against Skobelev. I, Asman-nuri-pasha, have ordered. Where is the reinforcement? The devil knows. He promised? Yes, he promised. Your Excellency Turks are being reinforced. New scarbs are coming from Plevna. Dukmasov, a horse. Major Gortalov - You will be at the command. - Yes, sir. Remember This is the heart of the enemy defence. Unfortunately, they don't understand anything in the headquaters. - I will go to convince them. - Yes, sir. Your Excellency! Contusion. Nonsense. A horse! I will bring reinforcement! - Hold the redoubt, Gortalov! - Yes, we'll keep the redoubt. Your Majesty! Where is reinforcement? You have promised! His Majesty himself has ordered to stop. There won't be reinforcement? I won't dare to change the order of His Majesty. I have no power. And I have the power to do what I think is right. Go, fellows! Forward! Stop! Where are you going? Pass. Stop! - Your excellency! - Save the banner, Katorgin. - Your Excellency! - The banner must be saved! Banner, I said! Follow him! Have you given up the redoubt? Have you?! Yes we have, Your Excellency. Has given up?! Did you leave Gartalov? Your Excellency, Major Gartalov, Is killed? With Turkish bayonetts. You may kill me! Mikhail Dmitrievich. - It will be the death of you, Mikhail Dmitrievich! - Like a child. What are you talking with him for? Take him off! Don't let him go! - Don't be upset Mikhail Dmitriviech. - Let me go! Nothing to be done, gentlemen. We must leave Plevna alone. We must retreat. We cannot retreat, Your Majesty. Just imagine, what pernicous consequences will follow the retreat! The moment we will start the retreat the Turks will finish off the Bulgarians devastate the country. What should we do then? Continue the war. Call for the guards. My guards? - My guards against some tarboosh? - Some tarboosh? But under these tarboosh, Your Majesty, There are not only Turkish heads. Call for the army? By the time it arrives... will we hold against Asman? I don't know. I don't know at all. He is the military minster... ... he must make the decision! I should be dismissed! Let me go deal with my horses! What should we do? Of course, situation is unfavourable. But we must find strength. and forbearance. As to the tactics we cannot attack the enemy directly... especially now that enemy had time to reinforce its positions. If we rely on the extreme courage and self sacrifice of the Russian solder as we have before then we will destroy our magnificent army. What can we do? It's a war. A war. We must charge nevertheless. In my opinion, Your Majesty. ... no need. I must have misheard? What do you mean, no need? We must convince the commandment to spare the Russian blood. So, the Russians decided against the assail of Plevna. ... and plan a long-term attack.. ... long-term assail. It means... ... they will stay there until winter. And even if they overtake Plevna... ... they will have to wait until summer. Why? To cross over the mountains. And this is what we need. We'll be ready by spring. Andrashi convinces me... that Bismarck ... has almost agreed... - to begin in the summer. - There is nothing in this world that does not have a decisive moment. One must be able to choose this moment. And we will choose it well. Twirl, whirl. Sow, blow. From above snaps, from below sweeps. Balkans, in one word. Hello, fellows! Stepan! Yes, it is me. - You are back! - Yes, I am. - Rascal! - Alive and well. - A dry bone, even a warm won't want to spoil. Good job! Hello, major. Hello. - Hello. - Hey, brother. How are you? It's cold, isn't it? So? Tell us. Tell us. How are things in Russia? - In Russia? - Yes. - People are angry with the government. - Angry? Yes. But they praise the soldiers. - They invite you everywhere and get upset if you don't accept the invitation. - Really? - Yes. - That means they live well. Not really. They have only water and bread. That's all. This. Or bagasse. I have heard, they've allocated plots of land to your people. Yes, they have. But we have not seen it. It means... ... it is hard there. To be honest, Russian folk never had an easy life. Tell me this. When we free you... ... how are you going to live? People have dreams. But the world is hard... Simple peple have similar lot. But there will be a different life one day, there will be. And what do you think, brotehr Panaiot? Congratulations, fellows! Plevna is ours! Asman gave up! With all its army, he gave up! - Hurray! - Hurray!!! The Turks gave up! What are we going to write to the headqauters today?! As always! All is well at Shipka! I believe this is possible... ... and necessary... ... to assail Balkans simultaniously in three different directions. I personally would like to cross the mountains. ... and right here... ... overtake Sofia. Suppose... that you and Karpov succeed in an unexpected attack. What is going to happen near Shipka? You will be hurt. Vessel-pasha has a strong camp right there. near Sheinovo. We should move around Vessel-pasha. around. From both sides. Let General Radetsky remain where he is in the centre. near Shipka, and distract the Turks. Meanwhile Skobelev and Svyatopolk-Mirsky circumvent them from the right and left. Skobelev will do so through Imyaotlim. And Svyatopolk-Myrsky - right here, through Pravlensky passage. But I will be late. It is twice as long. Nikolai lliych, of course, all movement must be coordinated. But we will have to cross the mountains. huge military regiments ...carts, artillary, cavalry. - Suvorov succeded. -- through Alps. - Even the locals themselves don't think it is possible to cross Balkans in the winter. Allow me, Your Majesty. to call for a local peson. - A theater, real theater. Thanks God it's no cabaret. Call them. Call for the Bulgarian. Is it possible to cross Balkans in this time of year, Panaiot? The enemy won't cross. No. A friend - yes. Balkans are our mountains. We can guide through them anyone we want. We will give guides and people. bread, clothes, weapons, and our hearts. Just tell us. We will carry across Balkans the entire Russian army. Thank you, Painot. Thank you. As you wish, gentlemen. But this is madness. Why are we putting our heads through the noose? Suvorov had to cross the mountains. We can afford to wait for spring. Nobody is chasing us. Meanwhile, the Austrians will unite with the English and Germans and will gather their strength by spring - and attack us from the back. - General Totleben is right. We must attack unexpectedly. in the winter when they and their foreign council do not expect it. "At dawn of 5 January 1878" left regiment of Svyatopolk-Mirskoy has begun forced crossing of Gabrovsky passage." "By January 7 it reached southern flanks of the Balkans..." and has begun the battle with Vessel - pasha." Right regiment under he command of Skobelev by January 7 continued the forced crossing of the difficult Imetlisky passage. Oh! God saved us. The devil's passage? We've been at it for 2 days, and only half of the troops are up. Svyatopolk-Mirsky is fighing down there and we can do nothing. Mikhail Dmitrievich, you won't be able to get Vessel' into your teeth in person! Hurry up, fellows! Hurry! Look, we've reached the sky itself. How are we going to descend, uncle Makar? Yes, mate. Whether you want it or not, the must win over the Turks. We'll make it down on our buttoms, but there is no way back. Uncle Makar How will you ride the horse, after sliding on your buttom? Š Wow! An excellent road, guys! We'll ride like knife through butter. Let's go! Get ready, Turk! Know Russia! So, gentlement officers? Forward! He is sitting there since the morning. He is worried. Your excellency. The messengers from Duke Mirskoy. There is a letter. Read, fellow. I have no glasses on me. "I have reached Shipka since yesterday night." "All troops are ready to fight." "Reinforcement is not here at all." "The turks attack with full force." "I need your help to distract the Turks at least partially." "I have no news from Skobelev." Today the success of the war will be decided. Tell Misrkoy, I did what he asked me to do. Let it be the last blood shed at Shipka. - Begin the attack. - Yes, You Excellency. They stood until the last cartridge. Give signal to stop. -Where is the General? Duke Mirskoy's General. - What's wrong? Your Excellency We could hear our music. Must be Skobalev attacks. They always attack with music. A battle is the ball for a military man, isn't it so, Vasily Vasilievich? Look, how they march! Better than at a parade. Shipka moved. Radetsky attacked from the front. We should do too. Disperse you all! You will be killed! - Take the banner off. - Yes! - The Turks know it well! My God! They will distroy him. He is charmed. Nothing will happen to him. They said in Kiev there is a charm over him. 9 days and 9 nights a volkhv - magician was putting a spell over him He did not give him no food, no drink. Only charms, until it worked. The bullets won't hurt him, they go through him without leaving a hole. He is charmed Increase fire! Lyapunov! I know you have been waiting. Unfold your Samara banner... and together with the Uglitsky regiment show the Turks the "Kuzkin mother" with a twist! Attack Sheinovo! You must move in two raws. First raw fires, second approches. -First moves forward, second fires! God with you! - Yes, Your Excellency! -Dukmasov! - Here, Your Excellency! - Bring me the musicians! - Yes! Tell artillary, fire without a pause! The Turks must think we have, tons of artillery. Vassily Vasilievich, what's wrong with you? with your talent you must avoid dying. I am keeping next to you, Mikhail Dmitrievich. - The fellows say you are charmed. - So? Maybe the charm will spread onto me too. Don't jinx it! - Nice. - Yes, the devils. Fellows from Valdimir! To the battle! Ak-pasha is clever like a fox. This new row will lessen their loss. And does not let us take aim. Stukov! Take your Cossacks and cut off the road to Kazandyk. All clear, Mikhail Dmitrievich. -Nikolai Grigorievich? - Yes? Take Vassel from the rear. Yes, sir. It looks like the Turk? He's got a white flag. And rascal Kozyr is chasing him. He will slash him down. Dukmasov, Stop Kozyr immediately. - Vessel-pasha asks to stop the battle, general. - Stop the battle? But I have not seen the signal of the white flag. Your Excellency. The turks raised the white flag. I saw it myself right there! A horse! Hurray!! Your... Your Excellency... Here. A scarb. I cannot hear anything, Lyapunov. I lost my voice. I lost it. But you've won instead! The sabre of Vissel-pasha? Exactly. And where is he? Under the big mound. ... is waiting. Dukmasov! Bring him over to me. Hello, General. I got your sabre. How many troops did you have? 35 000 and 115 weapons. [in Turk]. [ in Turk] He says, that Turkey is doomed today. Such is the will of Allah. You faught bravely. We soldires did our duty. But Russian soldiers win against most courageous enemy, General. Lyapunov! I charge you and Bulgarian troops to guard the captive generals and officers. You have earned the honour with your heroism. Goodbye, mon generale. - What scamp! - Who? - Pashi. To give up such a position with such an army!! Eh? Hurray!!! What's there? Where are they going? The shootings stopped. Hurray!!! Here you go, from the General Skobelev the sabre of Vessel-pasha. The Turks gave up. And now it will be quiet indeed at Shipka! Hurray!!! Whatever they say about us, Strukov we are the ones who are fighting. And our sins in front of the commandment God will forgive. People won't forget. Let horses rest and eat and start the attack in one hour. - Direction of the march - Andrianople. - Good. Andrionople? Gurkov crossed the Balkans. He took Sofia and is chasing Suleiman on the southern flank of the Balkan range. Suleiman might get to Andrinople. - Rest there. - And gain a foothold. - Right, Strukov. That's why we need to come before Suleiman. We will eat bread together now The Bulgarians and Russians In need and trouble In grief in joy together. Hurray!!! And now, to Constantinople (Tsargrad). Hurray!!! Brilliant success, your Majesty. Charlu is taken. 80 milestones until Constantinople. Do you hear it, Duke? 80 milestones until Constantinople. For these 80 milestones We would have to cross swords with another two-three enemies. What enemy? All the Turk troops are defeated. But who are not defeated are completely fresh, as far as I know troops from Austria, England and Germany. The English squadron of the admiral Sir Hornby just left Malta with the course to Istanbul. The Western states have given us an ultimatum. Aleksandr Mikhailovich And Bismarck offered his service as a mediator. Yes, the honest broker wants to profit as well from the Balkan fire. We must make peace with Turkey. Immediately. Before the West recovers from the astonishment and surprise We must sign a bilateral treaty with Porta. We must notify Europe about this as a completed act. And the troops? What should we do with the troops? - Forward, fellows! Hurray! - Hurray!!! Your Excellency! General Totleben and General Gurko are coming to visit us. And Radetsky? What's the matter? Hello. Hello. You must stop the attack, Mikhail Dmitrievich. Everyone did. But you? Continue? To stop? How is it possible, your Excellency? An order by telegram from St Petersbourg. Dukmasov! A signal to the trumpeters to stop, everyone to the reserve column! Fellows. I am guilty without guilt in front of you. We are not afraid of an honest battle. But we should not loose blood because of the cunning of the enemy! I order you To stop! You've done all you could in the power of men! And Russia will remember with pride the glorious sons who went thousands milestones toward the very sin And in broken boats they cross the Danube like swans. Like eagles they flew over the mountain tops of the Balkans Like heros from the fairytales you suffered from the trials of nature! Despite the fierce winter you've crossed the Balkans took over the second capital of the Turks Adrianople and came to the shores of Bosphore to the very walls of Tsargrad (Istambul) You've helped your brothers Bulgarians to win over a century old enemy! You have freed Bulgaria from the Turkish yoke for good! Glory to you! Glory to the mother Russia! Years will pass and our heirs will say here passed the Russian troops and resurrected the glory of Rumyantsev Suvorovs wonder-heros! Hurray!!! Here you left your lives for the glory of the dear Fartherland. (song) You swore allegiance to Russia. and kept your word until your grave. Nothing threaten you, no wave, no menacing bullwark. Without fear you joined the battle, which was right and true. "To the Heroes of Shipka" from units 3 of the Ukrainian front if the victorious Red Army 1944 [Sleep in peace Russian eagles.] September 1944 [The heirs remember and multiply your glory]. Glory! Glory! THE END
