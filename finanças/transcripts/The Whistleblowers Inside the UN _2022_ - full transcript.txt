I've not been back here since. It's been almost a full year. And, I mean, we left that day. I haven't slept here since. What do you see? A mess, I see that we left in a hurry. Erm, yeah. I mean, basically, we were taking what we needed. We were unpacking boxes of documents on the table. It was... ..get out of here before they send the police back. I was terrified. I was probably about where you are now when I heard the footsteps behind me. So the police have now entered my home, and that changes everything. So I got my phone out of my pocket... ..I started recording... ..and I started telling them to leave. THEY SPEAK IN FRENCH They'd been told, come get her, take her into custody, for the UN. It was really clear that they had instructions not to leave this apartment without me. The UN sent the police here because I'm a whistleblower. But I'm not the only one, there are many whistleblowers at the UN. There's nothing unique about my treatment. Every whistleblower gets the same treatment. We're all accused of all kinds of other wrongdoing to try to cover up whatever it is we blew the whistle on. It was just like this black box of, like... ..of pain. I am so tired, I don't have any sleep. In the UN, under normal course of events, you need to request permission to speak to the media. But this is not being done as a request from the BBC. This is being done under Article 2.6, which is the whistleblower provision. If you want to talk about crooks, you can find them all at the highest levels of the United Nations. Working for the UN, people always think that the threat is going to be from the bullets or from the locals. But the last thing that I expected it to be from was the director of security of the World Food Programme. Since speaking out, the UN retaliated to me to the point that it has, you know, almost broken me. The idea is to try to discredit the whistleblower. It's about a culture of fear. Whistleblowers are often presented as somehow hating the UN altogether and wanting it to be disbanded. Nothing could be further from the truth, we just want it to be better. We're going to make a change, we're not giving up. The UN is going to be better and we're going to be part of making it better. We meet within an institution built from the rubble of war. Designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace. I think that the UN has emerged to create world peace and I'm one of those that think that it's important that countries have a forum where they can tackle global issues together. The UN was set up as a way of resolving differences and extending universal rights and freedoms. From the time I was probably a teenager, I was attracted to the idea of working for the UN. So it was always an aspiration, actually a dream of mine, to work for the international organisation. To all those who dedicate themselves to this noble mission of this institution... We must come together in a collective coming of age. You are the last, best hope of Earth. It is an organisation that's there to prevent the scourge of war and to ensure that everybody has a life of dignity and respect. President Putin, stop your troops. There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell. I thought the UN stood for integrity, for transparency, for helping poor people, for freeing the world from wars. And I was very idealistic about the UN. So, thank you very much for waiting. I'm Dan Thomas, I'm the spokesperson for the president of the General Assembly. And it is my honour and privilege to introduce the Secretary General designate, His Excellency, Antonio Guterres. Sir. After ten years of serving the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, refugees fleeing from all conflicts around the world, it is an enormous privilege and I feel humbled for this opportunity to go on serving the international community, serving our common humanity. Have you told your parents that you're coming on this programme? Yes, I have. What did they say? Erm, I think they're quite proud of me. They're worried, obviously, for my future. They know me well enough and I think they gave me enough moral sense to know that I'm not going to participate in the active endangerment of other human beings, for a pay cheque. When I was a child, I had this kind of really utopian vision. The idea that there was somewhere where people could get together from all over the world and solve the big problems. A large part of that was growing up in Northern Ireland and sort of seeing people being shot in the streets and hearing explosions. EXPLOSION You have this idea that it could be better than this. So for me, the UN, yeah, it was a dream to be part of that. The Human Rights Council is the UN's highest body that discusses human rights. And it's also basically the only body within the UN system where NGOs can take the floor. All Dutch speakers to adhere to language that is commensurate with the dignity inherent to the discussion on human rights. It was incredibly inspiring. It can get quite politically charged because you have, sort of the repressive governments are present in the room while people who sometimes they have tortured are calling them out for that. People sometimes knew they were risking their lives by speaking. If people are willing to take that kind of risk, I think there is an incredible responsibility on the UN staff to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep them safe. Since Chinese President Xi Jinping became China's President in March, several hundred Uyghurs have been executed extrajudicially by Chinese security forces. The government blames Uyghurs for every major terror attack it faces. Once, there were hundreds of Uyghurs in mosques across China, but now only a handful brave police checks. There is no other room in the world where a group of Uyghurs is present with a group of Chinese diplomats. It just doesn't happen. It was January 2013, and I got this email forwarded through from the Chinese delegation. And they wanted to know whether, it was a group of 13 names... And they were asking us to tell them, as a favour, and they used the word "favour", whether or not those people were coming to the Human Rights Council in March. And my immediate reaction was, of course, "We are not telling you that." There had been stories of people's families being arrested, tortured, detained, disappeared. It was just so blatantly obvious that there was no way the UN Human Rights Office could do this. Erm, that was unfortunately not the view of my boss. And he said that... ..names should be given to the Chinese delegation. Erm, I and a number of my colleagues objected to this. We had a meeting with the Chinese delegates, where he asked for the information, and we gave the distinct impression that he wouldn't be getting it. And they sort of indicated a bit of a quid pro quo without saying it. They talked about the possibility of increasing their funding to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Just after that meeting, they invited the then High Commissioner for lunch. And my boss overruled all of us and gave him the names. Some of the responses I've had from UN managers have been disgraceful. I mean, the person who has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that people are kept safe if they interact with UN human rights mechanisms, told me that according to his information, nobody had been exposed to "additional" danger. So it's almost like we're saying, "Well, China's so repressive that they're going to go after "these people's families anyway, so what does it matter?" And that is not what the Human Rights Office should be saying. People look to the UN to protect them, they look to the UN Human Rights Office to act for human rights, not to aid and abet an ongoing genocide. It is sickening and it must stop. My best assumption at the time was that on balance that people in the UN would opt to do the right thing, that somehow good would prevail. I was wrong. I was recruited right out of graduate school and was then committed to be... Supposed to be committed to a lifetime in the UN. I had a permanent contract, I wasn't on any kind of temporary assignment, so there is every expectation on my part and on the UN's part that I would continue to work there until I retired. British paratroopers, Gurkhas and combat engineers spearheaded the dawn advance, the launch of an extraordinary exercise in logistics and an extraordinary peace mission. In the fall of 2002, I was assigned to be the chief of logistics in the 17,000-person mission, which the UN was running to administer the then breakaway province of Kosovo. Kosovo has long had a shortage of electricity, so one of the solutions proposed was to put out proposals to build a new power plant. Unfortunately, we started hearing allegations that among the respondents, there was one in particular that was prepared to pay 10%, which was equivalent to 500 million US dollars, of the winning bid as a kick-back to the decision-makers. And of that 500 million, a certain percentage, the equivalent of 18 million US dollars, was going to be paid to my colleague. Any toxic environment of corruption, everybody is assumed to be corrupt. So often times, we would look into it and say, "Well, there's not much here," but in this particular case, we heard it consistently, we heard it loudly, we heard it from sources which were...unconnected, one to the other. And we did find that there was enough evidence to raise this with the Inspector General of the United Nations. I sent by secret courier everything I had on these people. The Inspector General of the United Nations contacted me and said, "I'd like you to work with us as a whistleblower," the first time that she had ever designated anyone formally as a whistleblower. So, she sent 12 people under various guises to serve as an investigative team in Kosovo, to work with me on getting to the bottom of these allegations. And how did it feel to be the UN's first whistleblower? I don't think I understood the implications of that at the time, and I didn't think... I didn't know I was the first whistleblower. I thought this was something that had happened before. It wasn't until I got really in the middle of the hell storm that followed, that I discovered that I was the first whistleblower and that all the whistleblower machinery that had been set up only the previous year, had never been put to the test. So, I was the test case. So you weren't scared? At the time, I wasn't scared at all, because I was just doing my job. This is what I was there to do. Unfortunately, the Inspector General wrote an email to the top rank of the UN in New York, informing them that this investigation was under way and naming me, unfortunately. That immediately, given how the UN leaks like a sieve... that immediately was referred to the UN operation in Kosovo, to the individuals that I had accused of being engaged in corruption and they then began a series of steps about which I did not know, to retaliate against me as the whistleblower, to shut me down, and that included the elimination of my office completely, and to terminate my relationship with the UN mission in Kosovo. Wow! That was just the beginning. It got worse from there. How did that feel, to be targeted by the organisation that you had given your life to? It was devastating. I... It got... The drumbeat against me got louder and louder and louder and my life, I felt, was in jeopardy because I got in the way of an alleged $500 million kick-back. That's a lot of money. I had this vague idea that maybe by the time your documentary comes out, they've apologised to me and everything's fine and... I think that's not going to happen. If it's gone on for four years, they're not going to turn round and apologise to me now. The job involved developing proposals for new projects to do with energy efficiency, sustainable transport, renewable energy, and getting the funding approved and then doing the oversight. And I thought this would be a challenging assignment and something interesting to sort of really use my skills and to contribute towards one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime, which is climate change. The UNDP has a budget of over five billion US dollars a year, and has up to 10,000 people. It's operating in 170 countries and it's the largest of the specialised agencies of the UN. This is not a story about corruption in Russia. It's more a story about cover up inside the UN, and the real crime that there's been such a huge effort to cover it up. I first realised there was problems around ten years ago, payments with no reports, reports that made no sense. No-one was doing anything about it, so on one project, a 23-year-old university student was hired to manage a $5.4 million project and when I protested, I was told to keep quiet. On another project, there were all these friends and family contracts, which included a mother, a daughter, a son. One senior official told me, "We all know there's corruption in Russia, "our job is to stay as far away from it as possible, "so, John, keep quiet, we don't want to report it." Most staff have the approach of an ostrich. I decided that the problems were so bad that what I was going to do was not approve the budget for one year, until these problems were fixed. And when I did this, I was overruled and the budget was approved while I was on holiday in New Zealand, and when I came back, I was told never to do that again. If I wanted a future with UNPD, I must never do this again. In 2014, we hired an international consultant to look at redesigning the project strategy because it wasn't working with the appropriate organs of the Russian Government. He came to me in Moscow and said to me, "This project is a money-laundering scheme. They're syphoning off money. "This is not serious work." I sent this to my supervisor in New York, my supervisor in Istanbul, and I got no reply. My boss was scared because he knew that there were a group of friends in UNDP that didn't want the truth to come out, so there was no support from senior management. It's about the culture. It's about a culture of fear. I mean, there's 700 million people in the world who lack access to energy, who live on less than $2 a day, in extreme poverty, and it makes me very sad to think that all that money that is supposed to be going to help these people to mitigate climate change, to adapt to climate change, and a large amount of it is just being syphoned off and people don't care. It's sad. Their idea in dealing with whistleblowers is they must destroy the individual, by any means necessary. In Xinjiang, people are being tortured, women are being forcibly sterilised. On the 12th of May 2021, the UN had its only meeting to date on the situation in Xinjiang. It was organised by the US, British and German delegations. This combination of atrocities amounts to the crime against humanity. I had registered to attend. And registering to attend means that I would have been able to take the floor. And the UN was aware that I was likely to bring up its policy of handing names to China. We welcome everyone to visit Xinjiang, but we oppose any kind of investigation based on lies and with the presumption of guilt, which no sovereign state could accept. So, five minutes into the meeting, which I was attending remotely, there was a knock on my door, and I open it and I'm very surprised to see two Swiss police. SPEAKING FRENCH They told me that they had been sent by the UN and that they were there to take me, basically, against my will, to a mental hospital. So, effectively, the UN tried to have me sectioned. It took a very long time to persuade the police to leave because, as the police kept saying, "The UN has sent us here." There is a tendency to believe the UN. So the UN very successfully ensured that I was kept very busy for the entire period of that meeting. It's much easier just to try to discredit the whistleblower. Think about it, you're, like, one person up against an organisation with billions of dollars of resources and lawyers and this and this, and it's much easier for them to try to discredit you than to allow the truth to come out. Someone came up behind me, took photos of me, and said that I was looking at naked women and had arranged to go and meet a prostitute, which is ridiculous. So it's a very clear case of malicious reporting and I can show from the WhatsApp chat and from my friend's testimony that I went to see my friend across the road and took a taxi to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and went back to Istanbul, and the UNDP just ignores the evidence. So I'm absolutely convinced this is a gang of friends and this gang of friends decided John is becoming too much of a nuisance because he's gone on about this corruption too much, and we're going to have to take care of him, and they still have my UNDP laptop from four years now, so I don't know what they're investigating, but they've had it for years and years. They spend more effort, more time, more resources to investigate the whistleblower than they do to investigate the corruption. And this is what they do over and over and over again against whistleblowers. They find all... They trump up some other... Some other episode, which is completely unrelated, find that person guilty of that and say, "Look, he or she is guilty "of this particular crime, therefore you can't trust anything he says." I'd like to know the personal toll this might have had on your life, you know? Yeah, it's tough... ..because... ..it just goes on and on and on. I was unhireable because of all this taint that they had insisted on putting around me, the character assassination and so on. I would get close to getting hired and then, mysteriously, the offer that I was told I was going to get on Monday... On Friday, I was told I was going to get an offer, Monday was silent and they wouldn't return my calls. That happened over and over and over again. After a year of this kind of treatment by the UN, I think nervous breakdown is an antiquated phrase and doesn't really describe it, but I did have mental health issues, for sure. Did you come close to thinking about taking your own life, Jim? Yes. What's been the hardest moment? Just the intrusion of privacy, when my girlfriend was really sick in the hospital and they wanted to investigate her, that's outrageous. When she's got a life-threatening illness and these clowns want to interview her, it's absolutely outrageous and absolutely unacceptable that they're trying to interview a terminally ill person and that's absolutely unacceptable. She died, yeah. I don't want to talk about it. I was ranked by the UN as equivalent to an Under Secretary General of the organisation. So, over the course of four decades, I've worked in the UN under Kurt Waldheim, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Kofi Annan, Ban Ki-moon, and currently Antonio Guterres. I, Antonio Guterres... I, Antonio Guterres... ..solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty... ..discretion and conscience... ..discretion and conscience... ..the functions entrusted to me... ..the functions entrusted to me... ..as Secretary General of the United Nations. People who get to the top have spent a lot of time trying to get there. They are very ambitious political actors and when they get there and they're confronted by moral dilemmas, their inclination very often is to want to look in the other direction. We bring together peace and development, together with human rights, in everything we do. Human rights is not a strong priority for the current Secretary General. I think a lot of it comes back to the ethos that's set by a Secretary General. He is a wonderful choice to steer this organisation, as we build on the progress of the past decade, while addressing the insecurity and uncertainties of today's world. Ban Ki-moon was the Secretary General before Guterres. So I saw up very close the way in which the organisation refuses to take responsibility, even in a situation where 10,000 people had been killed, hundreds of thousands been sickened, and where the UN's clear responsibility was demonstrated beyond all question. The Haiti case leaves me disgusted at the inability of senior UN officials, including the former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to take appropriate action when he was clearly able to see the deep injustice involved. When the UN arrived in Haiti, I had just started as a journalist. I covered from the early days of the arrival almost everything. I've covered some really dark days of UN operations. There was no war, it was political turmoil that internally Haitians could have resolved themselves. But when you have foreign boots that's coming, this is a war situation. And many Haitians saw it as an occupation force. I remember it was an evening, I was receiving some text from a few friends I have around the valley about these crazy symptoms that people were having, diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration and people was dying in a matter of hours. And at that time, I was working for an American network. I told my reporter, "We should go. "We should go there to see what's going on." And arriving at Saint-Marc, the biggest public hospital in that area, I never felt that... That scared. I was the cameraman shooting this. People was literally dying at the entrance of the hospital. All the most affected area was along the river that goes all the way from the north to the centre of Haiti. And I heard in a place in the Central Plateau that there were people that drank the water of this particular river and had died the same day. So, I realised close to that area there is a big UN base. I told to my reporter that we should go there. We found UN military, UN personnel, taking samples from the very soil of the base, putting it in plastic bags. And we got suspicious. We go more around the base. We could clearly see, not only the proximity of the toilets, the sewage reserve of the soldiers was so close to the river. But we even saw the leaking coming from the sewage, the sewage leaking into the river. They looked nervous and that's when we start asking them what they were doing. They were really, really furious, they didn't want to talk. And that's where we started thinking about whether there would be some connection to... ..to the base. And the thing is, we didn't know yet what was it. Aid agencies fighting an outbreak of cholera in Haiti have warned that the disease is spreading. More than 200 people have died and thousands have been seeking medical help, overwhelming the country's hospitals and clinics. People are pouring into hospitals with diarrhoea and dehydration. The authorities now have to try and stop it spreading. People were dying every day. I don't know how I didn't catch it, myself, because it's easy to catch. It looks like... Looks like the end of the world. It was really... It was really scary. The UN Secretary General, whilst on a visit to Haiti, refused to answer any questions about responsibility. Ban Ki-moon, why don't you apologise in the name of the UN to the victims? No questions, there's no questions. No questions. There will be compensations to the victims? No comment - that's the answer we got repeatedly. There was a court case in the United States. That was dismissed because the UN pleaded, and indeed it has what's called immunity. It's accepted legally that the UN has to be immune from legal action, if it's going to be able to operate effectively in countries. It can't just be sort of handcuffed by lawsuits. But the people of Haiti have just been hung out to dry. More than five years after the initial outbreak of cholera, people are still dying. Throughout this time, the UN has steadfastly refused to accept any responsibility for the outbreak. I took up the case. I wrote a report, which proved to be a very damning indictment of the UN. Those who've seen the report, say it states clearly that the epidemic would not have broken out if it wasn't for the action of the United Nations. The report goes on to state that the UN policy in Haiti is morally unconscionable, legally indefensible, and politically self-defeating. And so, I found myself on the 38th floor, meeting with the Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon. He essentially recognised what was going on, but then tried to tell me that, unfortunately, the legal counsel told him that there was nothing he could do. I said very clearly, "That's ludicrous, "you're the Secretary General, the legal counsel can give you advice. "In my view, the advice he's given you is completely wrong, "but you don't have to accept the advice he gives you. "You can stand up." And Ban Ki-moon's response was telling, saying, "No, I feel that I need to respect the advice he's giving me." In other words, yes, this is a moral outrage, but there's nothing I can do. On behalf of the United Nations, I want to say very clearly, we apologise to the Haitian people. We simply did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and the spread in Haiti. We are profoundly sorry for our role. He said he's sorry for what happened, for the suffering of the people. It's like an earthquake happen or like a hurricane happen, like, you know, a natural disaster that nobody could have been able to prevent. But cholera was not an act of God, or, you know, an act of nature. The cholera was negligence of the UN. The UN has consistently refused, first, to acknowledge its responsibility and second, to pay even a cent of compensation directly to the victims. And so, if you allow a precedent to be set, and this is what the UN lawyers exactly want, when a major catastrophe happens around the world, for which the UN is clearly responsible, it will do nothing. I didn't want to be at home being a housewife. I wasn't cut out for that. The United Nations was set up for a very noble and important reason. The World Food Programme is a huge operation. It's one of the biggest humanitarian operators worldwide, really, the amount of food that's moved around. I was working in Pakistan. It was during the floods, it was 2010. The floods had swept all the way through the country, from the north all the way down to the south. And I was working for the logistics cluster on that mission and we organised the helicopters and planes and hovercrafts and so on. So, when I tell people about the places that I've worked in, the vast majority of them being in active conflict areas in the Middle East, you know, places like Libya and Syria and Iraq and Gaza and so on, people always think that the threat is going to be from the bullets or from the locals or...what have you, and the last thing that I expect it to be from was the Director of Security of the World Food Programme, Mick Lorentzen. I was looking for a more permanent position because it had been a constant role of these short-term contracts. It was in the bar in the evening - Mick said, "Oh, no, no, you know, you should come and work for me." I thought, "Me?" He said, "I can get you a job. You and me are the same. "So when shall we go and have sex?" What the fuck?! Like, what?! And I'm just, um... My whole body is freezing. And, I'm... I'm just thinking... ..how stupid am I? How stupid am I?! It was like, "You know I can get you this, "so when are you going to, like, seal the deal?" You know? "Where's my reward?" Um... I felt that I absolutely had to report what had happened, um, but it was an emergency mission, it was very skeleton staff, it was all hands on deck, and there wasn't really time for, you know, I don't know, sitting around and kind of complaints, I don't know. Um, so... But I was referred to go to speak the stress counsellor. That was where I was told to go. And he took lots of notes and he said, "That's absolutely terrible. "It's really important that you report that. "You should speak to investigations and so on." And then, he said, "Do you mind if I ask who it was?" And for whatever reason, I felt like... Why had I not told him? There... Just this... I had this feeling. And so, I said, "OK, I'll tell you who it was. It was Mick Lorentzen, the Director of Security." He actually pushed his notes across the table and he said, "I'm terribly sorry. There's nothing I can do. He's my boss." I moved to the United Nations in August 2015, and in 2017, the #MeToo explosion arrived on the world stage and I think caught many people by surprise. And my role was moved from being Policy Director to becoming Executive Coordinator and Spokesperson on addressing sexual harassment. When I took on this role, I was very clear that I was going to be there to do whatever it took to deliver for victims and survivors, whether that involved upsetting people or whether that involved saying things that were critical of the United Nations. That was the job, as far as I was concerned, and I was willing to take those risks. When somebody demands sex off a colleague or a potential colleague and they do it in a way which is an expectation, what they're expressing is entitlement. They haven't done this for the first time. They have a history, they have got to this point where they know they can get away with it. And in Kirstie's case, what we know is the person who's wanted sex in exchange for a contract, has other allegations against him. I don't think this is a surprise. I think people who reach that stage of sexual abuse have tested out what's acceptable, what they can get away with. I think the United Nations has become a place where predators feel safe. Doing good work, or being in an organisation with a good reputation, is a fantastic cloak for abuse, because you're beyond scrutiny, people think you're a good person, and they can't believe you would do these bad things. In the UN building in New York, on the second floor, there is a beautiful open space called the Delegates Lounge, where the diplomats and UN staff can go. On Friday nights, there's a bar. And it's well understood that young and new staff go there to try and make connections and do networking, and look for their next steps and so on, and it's commonly called a meat market, where young female interns are preyed upon and where sexual harassment is rife. You can sit there and watch how more-senior men sit and talk to and chat to and offer promises to young women. I had a woman, a colleague came to talk to me about something that happened to her and she said, "I used to type "this guy's speeches about gender equality and women's rights. "This is the man who came to my cubicle "and grabbed my breasts, several times, after a staff party. "Who's going to believe me? "He's a good guy, he's a star and he's a senior, "and I'm a junior person. I've got no credibility here." There is this sense with many people that the UN is a place of impunity and that impunity applies whether you're abusing outside or whether you're abusing inside. Nobody starts with a rape. They've led up to this. They've practised. They know what they can do. They know the organisation's going to protect them. Djordjina was 15 when she was assaulted by the UN soldier. I filmed Djordjina, taking me through what happened. And that's when I decided the UN should know. I went to the UN. And I explained, "This is what I come to report "and I think you guys should maybe look at it all." After I did that first report with Djordjina, more people started paying attention to the situation of sex abuse by the UN. There were children, women, young girls, young boys. More and more children, not only in her neighbourhood, but across the country, that was getting systematically victim of UN soldiers, or UN personnel... ..across the country. It was not like one isolated case of one soldier, of one bad apple. It was happening almost everywhere you had a UN base. These UN soldiers felt so above the law. This is the United Nations. I oversaw the budget of UN peace operations. That's aid approaching $9 billion. I oversaw field personnel. Thousands and thousands of UN civilians. You feel good, showing up in a country and going into the diplomatic line and showing your UN laissez-passer. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't say there was some satisfaction in reaching that level and being treated as a dignitary when you go around the world. It's pretty common in human nature to find people who love power and certainly folks running the Department of Peacekeeping were not immune to the attraction of power. In terms of the soldiers on the ground, whether it's UN soldiers or any kind of dominant foreign-occupying soldier, there is a power imbalance and that was always the case with the United Nations. French peacekeeping soldiers raped and sexually assaulted starving and homeless children, some as young as nine, in exchange for food. It's alleged children were sexually abused at a centre for internally displaced people. A leaked internal UN report says in one case, a nine-year-old boy and his friend were forced to carry out a sex act on two French soldiers. A member of France's peacekeeping force, the Sangaris, tied up and undressed four victims and forced them into performing bestial acts. Several of the fresh allegations involved minors. Currently, a total of 29 cases of sexual assault, exploitation and rape, involving 120 Congolese peacekeepers. And it's certainly not the first time such accusations have been made against the United Nations mission in CAR. We're happy to be joined by Tony Banbury, who as you know is the Assistant Secretary General in the Department of Field Service, and as I mentioned earlier, he's here to talk a bit more in detail about the new allegations of sexual abuse. You gave a statement where you... You seemed to struggle emotionally. I recall that very well, and the case that was, the rape of a child... In... I think it's hard to... Um... It's hard to imagine the outrage that people working for the United Nations and for the causes of peace and security feel when these kinds of allegations come to light. The reason I was emotional at that time was because I had a daughter that age. Um... Here we are, seven years later, and it's still very upsetting to me. There's hardly a worse thing that a human being can do to another human being. For me to stay at the UN at that time, I needed the organisation to prioritise... ..that girl. And they prioritised the perpetrators. And that's why I had to leave. My message of zero tolerance has still not got through to all those who need to hear it. We are here today to chart a way forward for achieving that. I believe the disturbing number of allegations we have seen in many countries speaks to the need to take action now. Enough is enough. Sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment in the UN happens in headquarters, it happens Monday to Friday, it happens during regular work hours, it happens everywhere. I've always been interested in social issues. I've always felt strongly about justice. I've always believed in civil courage. I joined the UN in the mid-2000s. And I worked for UNAIDS for almost 15 years. I grew up in Canada, the daughter of a single mum. We grew up on welfare. We lined up at food banks. But I also grew up in a country that provided opportunities for everybody. In my upbringing, I knew that I also wanted to be part of a larger change in society. And I joined the United Nations as the Country Director for UNAIDS, which is the joint programme that the United Nations has on HIV and AIDS. When I moved to headquarters, I worked quite closely with management of the organisation and there was a manager there, a senior, senior manager. He was, in fact, one of the top-ranking officials of the United Nations. His name was Luiz Loures. I'm sitting down with Dr Luiz Loures, he's the Deputy Executive Director of the UNAIDS and the Assistant Secretary General for the UN. Why don't you tell me about the challenges that are still facing HIV today? I think the most, the most important is to make sure that we bring with us... I first met Luiz Loures in 2013. This was a very senior individual, the Deputy Executive Director, which in a UN organisation, it's equivalent to being a vice-president, a very powerful man. Within the first day of my meeting, he had invited me to lunch, and I declined. He was sleazy in his way and he was the way you would think of somebody that might behave with a tourist on a beach in a certain setting. You know, somebody who is picking up girls in a nightclub, just that he had transferred that style to a work setting. And he felt himself entitled to be able to comment on your looks, look you up and down, give you a kiss, but instead of doing the air kiss, from left to right, he would be able to try to kiss you right there on the side of your lips, and would just sort of invade your personal space. He would also, in meetings, sort of sit and look at you while you were speaking, but not listening to what you were saying. He'd feel quite free to sort of grab you, and his behaviour about touching and that, it would happen in public, where there would be tonnes and tonnes of people. He was known to women working in the organisations. It was completely open. It was talked about. It was joked about. I experienced unwanted arms around me, continual text messages, late-night emails inviting me to his room, offers of positions in his office that weren't even advertised positions. I had been working for the UN for more than ten years, when my life drastically changed. In May 2015, I was attending a work event in Bangkok, Thailand. I was approached by Luiz Loures. I was invited for a dinner, which I said no, thank you. I thought that it was inappropriate, but I didn't realise it was dangerous. In 2014, there was a meeting in South Africa and there was a dinner later in the evening. I knew that the danger point was really when the dinner breaks up and everyone walks back to their hotel and I thought, "I can't put myself in that situation." So I paid my portion of the bill and I went to the women's toilet and I hid in a stall, and kind of stood on the toilet, so my feet weren't showing, so that I wouldn't have to be assaulted or have an unwanted experience. I mean, it's unbelievable for me now to think, you know, you're so stripped of your dignity that you're hiding in a bathroom stall. As part of leaving the work meeting and we're going down the same elevator, he attacks me in the elevator. He comes at me all of a sudden, he tries to forcibly kiss me, he tries to touch me on my breasts and on my body and then, he tries to drag me out of the elevator towards a long, long corridor of his room. I push back, I pleaded with him to stop, let me go, and so... But he was... He was being very insistent and he was pulling my arm and I had to block myself with the elevator door to be able to stay in the elevator, because I was afraid. I was seeing that long corridor and my brain was obviously working very... ..very quickly and dreading what could happen. Um... And I was just trying to stay in the elevator and then I escaped. There was an attempt when I went into the lift to go to my room, he jumped in the lift and his floor stopped before my floor and when the door opened, he had attempted to kiss me, which led to an immediate kind of throwing back, on my part, which led to, um... I got a bruise here and when the door opened, he put his arm around me and tried to bring me out of the lift and down the corridor. And in the process, my shirt ripped and I forced my foot into the lift and I got back in and I got to my room. There are women in various parts of the United Nations, most likely all parts, who have been approached, they have been accosted, they have been raped, and the more we let the men who do this get away with it, the more they will keep doing it. What we know is that a third of UN staff say they've experienced sexual harassment in their work at the United Nations, it's an astonishing number. But the vast majority of cases, in my view, are not reported, so what we do know about cases is just the tip of the iceberg and people feel there will be adverse consequences for reporting, they will be retaliated against. If I had been attacked, sexually assaulted, I would likely not have reported it. No, I would not put myself through that process. Since launching a complaint and speaking out about what has happened to me, the UN and specifically UNAIDS have retaliated to me in very mean and hurtful ways, to the point that it has, you know, almost broken me. Within days of me speaking out, the organisation was organising a campaign in support of the Deputy Executive Director, Luiz Loures. And that's very painful, because it's almost like being violated all over again. They don't give you a chance to breathe. So, in 2019, I was fired for...made-up allegations. Why did you leave? I left the UN because I felt that what I could do in an organisation that told me I was not to criticise it, had its limits. I think pressure from outside makes a difference, and I want to be part of that pressure. It's about a culture within an organisation, not about one perpetrator or two perpetrators, and these people, the senior managers, are still in the system. It's the same people at the helm, running the show. There has been an institutional review. They've established that there was a toxic work culture, that there was a boys' club, that there has been severe abuse of power. All of that has been factually established. And to this day, the only one who has been fired, has been me. You know, the silence culture... You know, the boys' club, the... ..prevails. This goes all the way up to the top. All the way up to the Secretary General Antonio Guterres. We will not tolerate sexual harassment any time, anywhere. Antonio Guterres has been really clear about what he wants to see, but if he promises something and doesn't deliver, people think he's lying. We at the United Nations are mobilising to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse in our ranks, and ensure that the rights and dignity of victims are front and centre. I'm really sick of hearing this term "zero tolerance" for sexual harassment and abuse of power, because in my experience, the system has shown an enormous tolerance for sexual harassment and abuse of power. I think that zero tolerance is just a slogan and that it doesn't carry any weight. In the case of the UN, they are the police, judge and jury. You'll never face the real world, interact with real world police, or with the real world court, or... That's not how it's done in the UN, because of this immunity issue. That they are above the law. Ladies and gentlemen, finally, I would like to provide an update on our action to tackle sexual harassment. I am determined to do all we can to tackle sexual harassment at the Secretariate and system-wide in the United Nations. All sexual harassment reports are now considered category one, which means they will all be investigated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. I spent four years as an investigator in the United Nations Headquarters in New York. And as a result of that experience, I believe that the organisation is riddled with corruption from bottom to top. Let me play you a tape. This is Ben Swanson, the head of the investigation function in the UN Secretariat, talking about a meeting he was called to, when the Secretary General called all the senior staff together, obviously concerned about sexual harassment getting into the news. One thing that's really troubling about this recording is Ben is talking about Secretary General Guterres and his senior advisers, his legal counsel, all being part of this silence that's going on. He's talking about a female member of staff, a Director-level female member of staff complaining that an Assistant Secretary General sexually assaulted her inside the UN, and he's telling the Secretary General and he's telling the head of the legal function, and they don't want to listen. What does "favoured son" mean? Anyone with inside knowledge of how promotion works in the UN is that it is not merit-based, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Antonio Guterres didn't want to hear it. Why is the SG not saying, "This is outrageous, what do we do about it?"? "My zero tolerance policy means we have to act." Instead, we get an account of, "No, we're not going there." I think the only thing surprising here is that this tape has leaked and people have not been fired. It's, um... It's unacceptable and I don't think that it's a suitable leader for the organisation. In February 2020, I met directly with Antonio Guterres. And I was actually very surprised to get responses from... Clearly from the man himself. And he said, you know, "Diplomatic lounge, Geneva Airport." He gave me his flight time. I didn't even know Geneva Airport had a diplomatic lounge, at the time, so I had to find that. He said that he knew what I was saying was true. He knew that I was a whistleblower. He didn't want to engage on the actual issue, that the UN is actively endangering people. You know, it doesn't get any higher than Antonio Guterres. Potential whistleblowers I speak to, some of whom remain on various parts of the UN payroll, are multiplying, not diminishing. And it's across more organisations than ever, as I have discovered. It's UNICEF, it's the World Health Organization, it's UNHCR, it's the World Food Programme, it's UNDP, it's the Secretariat. It's all over the world. This isn't just a case of the UN being nasty to one whistleblower, or just seven whistleblowers, or to 20 whistleblowers. This is about making sure that nobody ever speaks up about anything. I still believe in the principles of the Charter and what the organisation stands for. But not this...organisation, as it currently exists. Will reform be easy? No. Is reform possible? Yes. Would you have to fire a lot of people? Yes. The hardest pain is when a lover disappoints you, right? It's not when your enemy does something that upsets you, it's when someone who you love and have such high expectations of and ideals about, when they disappoint you, that's really crushing. And I think for some people who care deeply about the UN, who have spent a lot of time working to advance UN ideals... When the UN disappoints you, it's really hard. It's really hard. Was it good? Yeah.
