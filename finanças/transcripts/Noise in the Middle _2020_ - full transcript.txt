Hi, Mr. Broderick this is Lindsey Cohen from the Legacy Home. I'm calling because I saw you pulled Emmy from the waiting list. - Yes, I know. - Look, I worked hard to get this exception, with your circumstances and all, it's very rare that a space opens up so quickly. Things have changed. I had to go to Canada for a few weeks. Okay, but unfortunately once you release Emmy's spot she starts at the bottom again. Are you sure you wanna do this? I don't know. It's what Sarah wanted. Then I wish you and Emmy the best of luck, Mr. Broderick. Emmy, stay right there. I'm gonna go ask this guy for directions. Excuse me.

But you didn't have to leak images of his wife all over the internet, man. Oh, she played dirty too, you know what? No, you're right. Let's just give it all back to her. See what he thinks about that. Cut the shit, Richard. I'm trying to save your job. Save my job? He hired me to be his lawyer, not emotional Sherpa. You know what? He'll call us in the morning and thank us. You know, I hope so. I can't hear you. What was that? What did you say? Seth, Seth? Son of a bitch! Emmy. God damn it. Emmy, I don't have time for this. Emmy, come on, Emmy. Are you kidding me? You gotta get out of there. Emmy. Great. Emmy. Emmy, come on, that's it. Get your butt out here right now! I'm not kidding. Emmy. I'm coming in. Emmy, no wait, God. Emmy, open this door right now. Emmy! Unbelievable. Emmy, what are you doing Who's up there. Just you me, kiddo. Just you and me. To my loves, we made it. Thank you for believing in us. I know it's tough taking time off of work, but you won't regret it. This treatment is going to change our lives and give our family the chance we never had. Maybe we'll hear our girl say mommy and daddy for the first time. And happy birthday to you Little Blue. May your light always guide us. I love you both beyond our dreams. Always by your side. Sarah. I love you both beyond our dreams. We made it. Maybe we'll hear our girl say mommy and daddy for the first time. Maybe we'll hear our girl say mommy and daddy. Maybe we'll hear our girl say mommy and daddy. Okay. Here, show me what's wrong. Emmy, show me. You've help me out, okay. Come here. You mom's not here, this is ridiculous. Did you push yourself? Mr. Broderick, thank you so much for coming. Hi, I think there's... Oh, that's okay, sweetie, we'll have you cleaned up in no time. - Unbelievable. - It's fine. Let's go. I just want to say, I'm so sorry. I got to know Sarah over the last year. She was quite an incredible woman. She was, thank you. This might seem like a dream at times, hey. With everything you've been through. Raising a girl without her mother can be incredibly hard. Do you have any family to help? My parents died and Sarah's parents hate me, so, it's just me. Listen, it's really just a learning curve. I will be here to help you and Emmy. We have some very special things we're gonna try over the next week. So I will need you to be on time. Yeah, my GPS wasn't working, I'm sorry. Also, no cell phones. Yeah, I still have to work. 30 minutes a day. That's all we ask. It affects the equipment. Fine, fine. All right. So just some quick family history questions. Sarah already answered but I just need you to confirm and have you signed a release. Are you taking any medications? Why? Emmy can't tell us what's going on, but genes might. Yeah, some SSRI's for depression and Xanax for the obvious. Is that a situation of depression or chronic Situation, is this completely necessary. Yes, I'm sorry, but we need all the information we can get. Do you have any history of mental illness in your family? I don't know. I'm adopted, so I have no idea of my family history. Okay. Do you have any history of alcohol abuse or any addictions? No. Oh, excellent. This is so excited, Emmy, isn't it? Understand that this is an experimental treatment completely voluntary. There's no guarantees of results, although we've been seeing some promising outcomes. All right, so I'm gonna have you sign here and there, and then we'll get started. Also, Dr. Helmond uses this touch app in tandem with the treatment. It's very simple. It might expand Emmy's level of communication. So you just press the picture. House. And the app gives her voice. If Sarah tried one of these kind of things, Emmy's not interested. Well, it's worth a try, though. I'll text you the link so you can download and put it on your phone, okay? So I will also be conducting home visits to monitor Emmy over the course of the treatment. I will be here for you, no matter what you can call me day or night. Let's go meet Dr. Helmond Okay. So looking good. You are gonna do fantastic. This will get easier once you get used to the sensation of the magnets. But I'm very excited about our chances of success. I hope so I have to get back to work one way or another. Well, that's the idea. Get everybody back to their lives. Now if you just proper her up. Focus, come on, don't be difficult Emmy. You need to sit still, here, here, here. There you go There will be a loud clicking sound. It might upset her a bit. Now, slowly increase the signal, as we continue. Whoa, hey. Well, that's it? Is she okay? Oh, yeah, she's totally fine. But Richard, she draws off your energy so the more calm you are, the better. What a fantastic kid you have here. See, that wasn't so bad, was it? Nice work young lady. We are done for today. Have a lollipop. She will be a little sleepy, that's normal. So just get her into a routine for the week. And please use the app it can open up new avenues of communication. But most importantly enjoy some time with your daughter. She needs it. Excuse me. Are we gonna do this every time? Come here, let's go ahead. Encompass the full understanding of astrology. Hey, I love the camera. Oh, the light will kill me. Can I help you sir? I saw this booking window I was wonder if you could tell me what that symbol means. Cool, let's take a look. That is an hourglass, although modern parlance we call it the infinity sign. You think about getting a tat, you're gonna tated it up? Yeah? Yeah, no, I, this inscription was on the cornerstone under the house where we're staying. Had an inscription with an S and an H. Does that mean anything to you? Ah, okay. What were you doing under the building? It's kind of a long story. You know, I got a buddy who works down with the library has access to the town archives find out what you're setting on. - Damn it, Emmy. - No, no, no that's okay. - It's cool man. - I will pay for it. - Whatever it. - No, no, you don't have to pay, this is cool. I couldn't even give this thing away. In fact, do you want this? Do you want that? Okay. That's fine. This is a crystal of protection. ♪ Oh You don't have to do this. No, no, it's part of the thing. This is a crystal protection use wisely. I'm serious. Oh, take it, she loves the crystals dude. - Seriously... - I know. You know what you buy this book, crystal is free. - "Your Indigo Child". - Yeah, she's Indigo, look at her, she got smokin' blue aura man. You can see auras? Anyone can see auras. All you have to do is look closely man, empty your. Clear out, just filter the BS, okay? Blue. Yeah, come on. Hey, don't be jelly, your Indigo too, hello it's looking a little blue gray probably do them with some heavy shizz. Everybody does. I tell you what, leave your name, make your mark whatever it is you do. Put some contact info on here I'll get back to you find out whatever I can about that cornerstone thing. Don't worry about it. Hey, I got nothing but time. - Now, that I believe. - Bye, blue. I'm right here, I'm right here. Come on, I got you. What? Emmy. Watch out, watch out, he is coming. This way, hide. Emmy! Open the door. Honey, honey, is that you? Unlock the door. Open this door, it's not fun. Open the. It's okay, it's okay. There is nothing there, look. It's just the wind. It's just the wind. It's okay. "Your Indigo Child". Okay. Loves music and may sing before talking, interested in rocks, crystals and stones. When exploring high. Attracted to animals. Often sees angels and deceased loved ones. Hear that Sarah? Damn it , what are you doing? Me and Blue love you. All right, you just relax, young lady. We'll have you out of here in no time. She's not okay. She's fine, everything's normal. Well, it looks painful. Well, it's probably not physical but emotional pain she's reacting to. Emmy doesn't understand emotions. Well, she couldn't tell you about him if she did. So we open up the pathways so that Emmy can communicate her emotions. If they're there, we'll find them. She has the mentality of a five-year-old. You think? I had a patient a few years back in my practice, who became acutely aware that people he thought were laughing with him all his life, were actually laughing at him. That's a blow ha? Imagine reliving all those wonderful memories as the butt end of every joke. But he knows who to trust now, he's actually in college doing very well. My point is that that child's father said the same thing about his kid. Except I think he said the mentality of a three-year-old I believe. Sarah and I talked about this. You see, Richard, autism is a communication disorder. When you communicate, you have a sender and receiver. Everything in between is lost. I like to say that this machine helps us sort out all the noise in the middle, so we can hear Emmy. She's always trying to say something. Have you tried the app with her yet? Yes, she only likes her pictures. Well, that's good. Let her take as many pictures as she can. But please use the app it'll help us benchmark her progress. You need to be looking for any new developments in her behavior. You get a sucker. Okay. What are you tired? You're hungry? All right, here. Here you go. Stay right here I'll be right back. You hear me, Emmy? But blue can see the deeper you and she loves you just like me. Little Blue can't tell you things when you are noisy in a spin, she runs for calm and quiet space. Her voice lives deep within. Mr. Blue can't see like you, the noise drowns all he hears, but he loves you in his own crazy way. - Here you go. - That makes you disappear. Mr. Blue and Little Blue... - Emmy. - Here is something of a riddle. Little Blue... I know you can talk. You just got to tell me. Emmy, all right that's it. You do this again, you get nadda. Little Blue doesn't look at you. You think she does not see, but Blue can see the deeper You and she loves you just like me. Little Blue can't tell you things when you are noisy in a spin, she runs for calm and quiet space. Emmy! Emmy, where are you? Emmy. Don't move, you're gonna fall. You get your ass down here girl. Emmy! Emmy. Richard. Hi. Is everything okay? That's quite the nick, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine. Hey, I noticed kind of pressure. - Sure you do. - No, really, I do. I was a parent of a child with severe ASD. And that's why she does it, folks. I was 19 I had a little boy, he was nonverbal like Emmy. And you did the treatment and let's happily ever after. Not quite. I was angry at my boy, at life, at the man who left me. I tried to drink myself to death. My deal is different. Maybe. Dr. Helmond taught me that I live in the noise in the middle. The autistic lives in the now. Well, I like the noise. And oh, I mean, it makes life interesting, don't you think? All I wanted was a normal child, a child who didn't hit themselves. A child who didn't wake up screaming. I wanted a child who could be seen in public without embarrassing me. I got tired of resenting him. I felt like God had abandoned me. And so I thought I had no choice but to commit him. Sandra, you know, my expectations are pretty damn low. I would be happy just hearing the word daddy. But what I'm saying is if you can't quiet the noise, then you will never hear that word, Richard. So, what did you need? Well, as part of the treatment, we do house checks to see how our patients are progressing. How is she doing so far? Do you notice any changes? No, nothing really. I mean, I actually think she's getting worse. While the effects are cumulative, it's only the second treatment. You might not see changes right away. Let's see. Emmy. Sandwich. All right, now your return Sandwich. It's okay, it's okay. She might not get it right away. But keep trying. The app might help open things up. There you go, sweetie. Do you not know how she likes her sandwich? - No. - She likes her sandwich with a lot of mayo, one slice of turkey, one slice of tomato, cut in half. And how did you know that? Look closer Richard. The answer is right in front of you. All right, I cannot spend my entire day analyzing volumes of mayonnaise on sandwiches, okay? I'm not shaming you. It's just a reality. You have to work with you and Emmy need to get to know each other. You know, honestly, I just, I don't have time for all this, okay. Sarah is the one who spent her entire life trying to fix Emmy, not me. Maybe it's not about fixing her, but accepting her. I thought I had to let my child go, because I didn't think I had a choice. That was 20 years ago. You have choices now. Keep up with the app, do it together, see what happens. Trick or treat! I promise it will change your life. See you tomorrow. I'll go get you something. I'll be right back. Let's go. Keep it moving. Come on. Boy. Come on. Hey, come on, come on. Just follow him in. Boom! Emmy. Cool camera, let me take a picture. Emmy. Emmy, stop. What is wrong with her? That is not how you make friends kiddo. Can you just laid down, it's time to go to sleep. All right, fine. I could do this all night for all I care. Here. What are you looking at? There's nothing there. Here. Maybe your mum could shut you up. I'm done. Shut up! Me and Blue love you. She was quite incredible. Autism is a communication disorders. This treatment is going to change our life. This will seem like a dream at times, hey. Imagine reliving all those wonderful memories. Maybe it's not about fixing her. That all the noise in the middle. God had abandoned me. You won't regret it, you won't regret it. Me and Blue love you. What is wrong with you. You're useless. Emmy please comb your hair. You need to put the photo after you do the task, right? Emmy, no. Please stop, please, it's okay, it's okay. God. Just stay put and I will get some towels. Emmy. Emmy. Did you do this? Answer me, why did you do the? Oh my god, are you right? Show me where you're cut. It's okay, it's okay. I'm not mad, I'm not mad. Show me what's wrong. Talk to me, damn it. Really? Let's go. I know. - Rough night? - She got her period this morning. Really? Oh, your mother would have wanted to be here. How you doing? You sure she is okay? She looks really groggy. She's fine. This is happening because of the treatment. No, she's just becoming a young woman, right? Come on, let's go.

I need an explanation for what just happened to my daughter in that room. She had a minor seizure. It can be shocking, but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks Wait, wait, benefits, are you kidding me? None of these pseudo science magnet therapy bullshit matters anyway, all you want is my money. I should just pull it from the treatment right now. I know it's difficult but all of this matters. But the scans are very promising. Please let the process work. She has been absorbing everything around it for her entire life. She deserves the possibility to tell you about it. Come on. Don't you want to hear. Really? - Blue, hey, guys. - Emmy. Come in here, I got some info. the bird's, right here, don't leave me hanging. Yes, high zero works too. Wow, she's just popping, look at that glow. Okay, dude, I talked to my buddy at the library. Got some intel. Emmy, come on, we gotta go. right here. Hey, so apparently the place that you're staying at, built on the ashes of a poor house, this place burned down 1887. 46 children died. - Poor house. - Yeah, it's a place where society dumps its indigent, you know, orphans and idiots. Sorry, that didn't come out right. You know what? At least she's not an orphan. So anyway,. The keeper of the Sumter House, Mr. Sick-As-Shit Sumter. Yeah, he was a hardcore Puritan. Yeah, no sex, no drugs, no booze. I mean sounds boring as hell. But this guy was a fanatic. I mean, what makes it worse? Is that he actually branded the children with that infinity symbol that you found on the cornerstone yeah, forever in life, forever in death. Crazy shizz. Man, check it out too. Newspapers indicate that one of the orphans was so angry that he burned the place down just to kill him, talk about bad energy. How do you know if someone from the other side is trying to talk to you? You mean, like spirits. I don't know. I mean, they possess people and they can manipulate objects in the real world to let you know that they're watching or listening. But it takes a lot of energy to do that, you know. And so most of the spirits just take the easy route, dreams. Dreams? Yeah, it's much easier to reach people in dreams without outside distractions. Why? Are you getting some funky vibes on you? Maybe? I don't doubt it. I think that you're sitting on a ton of paranormal energy. Okay, your dreams will fill in what you don't know. Just keep your eyes open. - Okay. - FYI, I am teaching a lucid dream class on Fridays. This is a twofer, I suggest you check it out. We gotta go. Okay. If that place really is haunted, and she's gonna be in the thick of it, and she's an indigo, which means she's a conduit for spirits, good and bad. I'm just saying. - Emmy, Emmy. - No, no, it's okay. It's okay, she likes the crystals. It's normal. - No, it's not okay. - We're fine. Here, this is for you. And this is for you, and this is for your friend. I'm good, thank you. That's fine.

So how is she talking to exactly I mean, what is she using? Her. Oh boy, that makes sense. She's a perfect conduit, but you got to be careful when you come here. You gotta make sure that you're talking to the right person or entity or whatever. All I know is spirits can be really tricky. Friend of mine, talked to his dead grandma 10 years ago, he swears to this day. She's still watching him. Dude can't even jerk off looking over his shoulder. It's real tragedy. A Ouija board? I know it's cliche, but it's probably the best form of communication with the dead. I don't need a Ouija board. I know it's my wife, all right. I'm gone tomorrow. I'm not leaving without her. Okay, let me get this straight. You're going on a road trip with your dead wife. You can't take a ghost with you. I mean, maybe you can, but why? Why not? It's complicated. First, you got to bind the spirit. Do you have a book? You feeling all right? Never felt better in my life. Okay, sure, sure. I will, like I said, you just got to be really careful what spirit you bind with because once you do, you can't get rid of it. And the other thing is make sure that you're bind with the right spirit. Because if you bind with the wrong spirit, you will be cursed for life. Okay, you know what? I'm sorry. I thought I had a book that could help but I don't. Oh, hey, Tammy. Yeah, that hot yoga book came in. Listen, I gotta help her out and everything, all right? I'll be right. There you go. Hold it like this with your pinky out. And take a sip.

We know you're under a lot of stress. But I didn't think he was serious so I thought I would stop by. Is Emmy okay? She's fine. - Can I see her? - No, you're not her keeper. Richard, everybody goes though a lot of rough time with this. But don't give up. It's working. We're almost finished. This is about the money, isn't it? Money? No. I think you're confused. Are you okay? I'm not confused. The treatment is over. Stay away from my family. Child, you scared me. Are you okay? Mom here. Mom here? Emmy, what's wrong? - Bad. - Emmy, get out of the car. Come on, let's go. This is kidnapping. Next time, I won't be so gentle. Listen to me, we can't trust her. I don't want to going near her again, do you understand me? Do you understand me?

Those Peruvian bath bombs you ordered came in? Looks like you know one of my patients. What do you mean? I mean Broderick. Oh, you mean Blue? Yeah, they've been here a few times. Blue okay? I hope so. Hope so, what do you mean? It's Emmy's dad. He's been through a lot and I think he's buckling under the stress. Yeah. He weirded me out when he was in here earlier today? What happened? Oh, in a nutshell his wife is using Blue to communicate with him and he wants to take her home with them. What? Yeah, he wants to take his wife with them. You know, her ghost. How do you even do that? Oh, first you bind the spirit. Bind to what? Another entity. He wanted me to sell them a book on conjuring, it didn't feel right. And this book was. That's not there. I gotta go. I hope Blue is gonna be all right. I hope so too. This is Richard, leave a message. It's okay, it's okay, just think about your mom. Bring your mom here, okay. is gonna change our lives.
