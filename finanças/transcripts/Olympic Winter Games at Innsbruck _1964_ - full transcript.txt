ARGENTINA GREAT BRITAIN AUSTRIA POLAND In the name of all the competitors I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams. Thrilling drama, colour and speed. That is ice hockey. The Soviet Union versus Czechoslovakia. Goal for the Soviet Union. After 16 minutes, the Soviet Union surprisingly leads with a score of 4:0. The game has been decided. The spectacular final score is 7:5. A game full of passion and enthusiasm. Sweden versus the USA, the winner of Squaw Valley. This match meets the crowd's taste. Sweden wins 7:4. The Olympic Games are not simply grand scenes of sturdy men. Women also fight for fame with the persistence and elegance of their sex. 3x5 kilometre relay. Eight women battle for the top position. At the fore, the Finn Senja Pusula. She doesn't hold the lead long and the hopes of a victory for Finland's cross-country skier is over. First to pass the baton are the Soviet skiers Kolchina and Mekshilo. They're followed by the Swedes Martinsson and Strandberg. Senja Pusula comes in fourth behind Christine Nestler from the German team. The last exchange. Klavdiya Boyarskikh, the Soviet team's closing skier, glides along towards the finish followed by the teams from Sweden and Finland. The Soviet women's cross-country skiing team were simply unbeatable. The most successful athlete was the Siberian teacher Klavdiya Boyarskikh. She won every women's gold medal there was to win in Seefeld. Klavdiya Boyarskikh at the finish. Smiling, the Swede Toini Gustafsson finishes the race. Silver for Sweden. Then comes Finland's closing skier Mirja Lehtonen. She claims the bronze. The joy of the Soviet skiers is enormous. For the first time, they've won in this Olympic discipline. Before the enormous Olympic Ice Stadium, the speed skaters executed their dramatic runs. The high-performance devices of modern timekeeping methods are checked. Starting pistol for the 500 m race. The Soviet world record holder Grishin. His style represents the elegance and dynamic of speed skating. In slow motion, the commanding rhythm and precision of the gliding movements are revealed. At 40. 6 seconds, Yevgeny Grishin and his compatriot Vladimir Orlov, together with Norwegian Alv Gjestvang, reach second place. Gold! With a dramatic run, it's the young Terry McDermott, the speedy Figaro from the USA. A new Olympic record by... His record time adds up to 40. 1 seconds. Behind him, the world's top athletes who finished at 40. 6 seconds. Suspense and drama in the 5, 000 meters event. On the course ahead of Malkin of England is the Norwegian national hero Kupper'n Johannesen. The 30-year-old athlete won the gold in Squaw Valley for the 10,000 meters event. He's racing against two opponents. First, against time and also against his compatriot Per Ivar Moe, who's already sitting on the sidelines after finishing with a time of seven minutes, 38. 6 seconds. At the start of the final lap, Johannesen still trails Moe, but the athlete is accustomed to winning and finishes ahead of Moe in the end. Gold for Johannesen. Gold for Mrs. Johannesen. Below us lies the mountain country. We are in Tyrol. We are in Tyrol. Travellers are well acquainted with these magnificent views which again and again show how contrasts exist side by side. Above all, it may be the character of the mountain farming communities and the proximity of nature that produces such a profound impression. Seeing this life of mountain solitude, it's not hard to imagine the miracle of the heavens touching the earth. In this majestic landscape, the link between man and alpine sports seems to have come about on its own. This also explains why Innsbruck, city in the mountains, is more than most any other city well suited to the Olympic ideal. Innsbruck, with an eager heart and a sense of sportsmanship, has taken great pains to give the world a welcoming meeting place. "Upon this city, rests God's affectionate hand, "as the poet said. In the old town, one feels that nature and art stand side by side, that the old and the new go hand in hand. Of course, Innsbruck may just be one among many cities. But the mountains peek through the windows of every house beckoning the residents to come out and explore them in every season. Here on top of our mountains On our mountains where it is so beautiful As with most forms of sports, what started as work and utilitarian transport, was then converted by imaginative people into games and recreation then finally into serious sport. For the first time, luge debuts in Olympic competition at Innsbruck. Bold and fast, they shoot through the ice curves. It takes courage, strength and body control and a good feel for the ideal lines on an ice track to become an Olympic champion. The German and Austrian lugers overshadowed all of their rivals. The Germans Klaus Bonsack and Thomas K?hler completely dominate the men's individual runs. Bronze for Helene Thurner of Austria. Gold for Enderlein from Germany. Preparation for the two-man bobsleigh event. The approach has come to play an important athletic role which can be decisive. The new Olympic track at Innsbruck is the fastest in the world. Following the ideal line is the secret of the bobsled pilot. Even a small steering error can add hundredths of a second. The winners in two-man bobsleigh, Britons Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon, dethrone the two successful Italian world champions Zardini and Monti. The witches' cauldron, the most impressive curve on the Olympic bobsleigh track. The pilot must stand the test of this steep face. Here is the ideal line. Whoever fails to follow this line risks missing the entry to the straightaway. Ready to go. The Italian four-man bobsled with the renowned Eugenio Monti as pilot. The sleigh in the witches' cauldron. A change of the guard is about to take place in the bobsleigh. Bronze for Monti. The Austrian team with Erwin Thaler reaches for the gold. But in the end they take the silver. The Canadians start with aircraft dealer Victor Emery as pilot. A worn-out Italian bobsled. Too old for most teams, but it carries Emery and his team-mates to success. Bobsleigh is not just a sport. It is a passion that pursues its devotees even into their dreams. The bobsledder knows that in every race he's survived a dangerous adventure. An autograph from Erwin Thaler is worth a lot. And Olympic splendour even touches those who lift the victors onto their shoulders. Right before the Winter Games began, Innsbruck was without snow. Nature seemed to have other plans. With a mixture of compressed air and water, snow cannons spray onto the slopes the snow the heavens denied us. Snow blowers for clearing deep snow from the roads were used to pulverize snow masses that were brought from the distant side valley Gschnitztal to the ski runs. In baskets, soldiers of the Austrian Armed Forces transported winter to the slopes of the village Axamer Lizum. Just so, with innumerable efforts, the slopes for the alpine events came into shape. In specifically constructed trenches, the snow from higher areas was poured downhill. A picture reminiscent of the transport of felled trees down from the mountains. In certain spots, water hoses were used to bind the snow to the hillsides. Anyone with feet to stamp with was urged to walk the slopes. Even Professor Wolfgang took up his feet to figuratively and exemplarily put finishing touches on the slopes. As the Eskimos have shown us ice and snow can be used as construction material. The frozen waterways supply the bricks and slush the mortar. This practice is known as Aperschnalzen. It is still the middle of winter. In 1964, the weather gods led man and animal alike by the nose. These Innsbruck youths attempt to drive away the winter by whip cracking. At Patscherkofel is the venue for the men's alpine skiing competition. Who would expect to find a ski run in this kind of weather? The mood is rather that of a spring festival. Even dear old Grandma takes part. Inside the electronic data centre, modern calculating devices bring a quicker and more precise determination of results. Preparations before the start of the race on the Aperen Alm. Our athletes resemble swimmers without water, horseback riders without horses. Everything for beauty. And the beauty contest is another competition event. Cannons for the hot shot athletes. But with the proper perspective an old camera will do just as well. First up is the American Bill Kidd. The Frenchman L?o Lacroix. The great adventure on the 3, 120-meter-long course begins. L?o Lacroix risks it all to win it all. This is how the athlete races downhill towards the valley. A wide and solid white band through the steep high forest. The slope on the Patscherkofel. The champion's run, the Austrian Egon Zimmermann. Wolfgang Bartels of Germany wins bronze. Finding the right line is also the art of the alpine ski racer. Choosing the wrong line will cost you hundredths of a second and the chance at victory. Seventy seven skiers took on the mountain and themselves. Downhill skiing is more than just a sports competition. It is overcoming one's fears. All of the start and finish times, scores and jumping distances will be sent from the competition venues directly to the electronic data centre via a new remote data transmission system. The results will be calculated to within fractions of seconds. A few moments after the athlete has crossed the finish line his finishing time and ranking are already visible on the scoreboard. Millions of accumulated pieces of information are turned into results. These documents are sent via the remote data transmission system from the competition venues simultaneously, then duplicated and handed to journalists and officials. The president of Austria, Mr. Sch?rf and the mayor of Innsbruck, Mr. Lugger congratulate the winner, Egon Zimmermann. France's sports minister Maurice Herzog is pleased with L?o Lacroix's performance. The Ismailis are satisfied with Prince Aga Khan's performance, and Toni Sailer with all of his successors. The game of defying gravity plays a role in many different sports Differently at the Patscherkofel than during pair figure skating in the Olympic Ice Stadium. The ideal figure skating pair is made up of two personalities who succeed at combining their skills in total harmony. The Canadians Wilkes and Revell win third place. The German world champions Marika Kilius and J?rgen B?umler. Their position as favourites weighs heavily on their shoulders. Their freestyle section is flawless. But it is only enough for the silver medal. 5. 8, 5. 8, 5. 8, 5.4, 5. 8, 5. 8, 5. 7. Thank you. The last pair before the break: Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov from the USSR. And now for the final. On the ice, the Soviet champions Lyudmila and Oleg Protopopov. An effortless elegance of performance, complete harmony of movement, sweeping beauty even during difficult presentations: that is the magic of pair figure skating. Gold for the Protopopovs, silver for Kilius/B?umler and bronze for Wilkes/Revell. It's all about gold, silver or bronze in Axamer Lizum as well during the women's slalom race. Who will be successful? The doctor already knows. The slalom monitoring film crew is getting in position. The slalom requires a lot of preparation. Meditation before the race. Christl waxes the top of her skis. Edith chooses the bottom side. The Frenchwoman Marielle Goitschel at the start line. Boldly, the young woman from the Val d'Is?re scores the best time on her first run. Slalom is a dance on an inclined plane. Only athletes who find the right rhythm will be successful. The German Heidi Biebl was not able to find her rhythm during this race. She only reached fourth place in the overall ranking. Atop of the towers, the camera crews of the slalom monitoring film are busy. Each official slalom has to be filmed for monitoring purposes. The exposed film is taken to the lab by a messenger. OFFICIAL SLALOM FILM LAB His run isn't measured in hundredths of seconds, but it makes him thirsty nonetheless. Expert eyes follow Christine's run who will take the gold medal from her sister Marielle in the second run. Technology in the service of sports. Mere minutes after the athlete crosses the finish line the film is developed in high-performance machines within a very short span of time. Another Olympic record. The American Jean Saubert is hoping for a bronze medal. Every run is checked at the editing table and hung on an illuminated screen for visual inspection. The international jury assesses of the official monitoring film. The fall of Austrian skier Traudl Hecher is shown and studied. In this way each and every error and their causes become visible. The big sought-after moment. Christine Goitschel takes her rightful place on the winner's podium. Her sister, Marielle, is celebrating her. Even Jean Saubert gets a jubilant kiss. Christine doesn't seem to be quite as steady on level ground. In the Olympic Ice Hall not only the ice hockey teams but also the figure skating judges ignite the passionate interest of the audience. On the ice, the Austrian Emmerich Danzer. His freestyle section was the third-best. He clearly outperformed Karol Div?n of Czechoslovakia, but could not surpass him. Div?n's margin for his compulsory section was too large. The young American Scott Allen, however, pushes Div?n out of the running and takes third place. The battle for an Olympic victory leads through purgatory for the three-time European champion, Alain Calmat. This is not just a fall. It's a plummet from the heights of his victory hopes. The audience witnesses the tragic fall of a great athlete. Calmat, the great artist on ice, fails in the end. His soaring flight ends in failure. Immaculate and dreamily beautiful is this jump of Veikko Kankkonen of Finland. The quick hand on the snow in the run-out deprived him of victory. Calmat fell, but the jury granted him the silver medal in the end. 5. 7, 5.4, 5. 7, 5. 3, 5. 7, 5. 6, 5. 6, 5. 8. With an outstanding performance that outshines all former mishaps the German skater Manfred Schnelldorfer becomes the next Olympic champion. High and secure, that's how Schnelldorfer, student of architecture, builds his jumps. A well deserved and commanding victory for Manfred Schnelldorfer. At the Olympic village recreation centre, athletes from every nation relax together. The twist remains the twist. There isn't any twist. This foosball table reignites their passion for competition. They all get along, though they may not get what the other is saying. Their language is the language of sports, friendship and youth. And games belong there as well, as does the heart. But there are also peaceful oases within the recreation centre. Japanese athletes will find their local newspapers in the reading room, just like the Norwegians, Americans and Lebanese will find theirs. Below us, not in bright sunshine for a change, lies the downhill slope of the ski Amazons. 625 meters of elevation change separate the finish from the start. 20,000 spectators, despite the bitter cold, surround the white stadium. Race start for the Austrian athlete Traudl Hecher. Despite a painful ankle injury she has a fantastic run. The last decisive change of direction before the finish line. Traudl Hecher doesn't give away one tenth of a second. The Tyrolean has made it. She's won third place. On the slope is the fragile German athlete Barbi Henneberger. Her heat was less successful. In spite of a flawless performance, she only reaches fifth place. Grace and guts are shown by the Austrian Edith Zimmermann, who with elegant ski control commands the slope, whose gentle curves and turns evoke a feminine nature. Especially eager for the descent, Christl Haas, the girl from Kitzb?hel. She knows that today is her big day. A cheerful mood, a fighting spirit, well waxed skis and a slope made for her. Christl Haas on the long home stretch that again calls for total concentration and sturdiness. The victory is hers to keep. Three winners from one country. Three different temperaments, three medals for Austria. A kiss from her mother is the biggest reward for Christl Haas. The big race is over for the 10,000 people in Axamer Lizum and for the men of the mountain rescue team who did not have to step in during the race. These men would have deserved many of a medal. For Traudl Hecher, after the race there was not only the bronze medal, but also a brand-new cast and friendly consolation. It doesn't always have to be the gold During our big games There can only be one person To cross the finish line first It is so great to fight with fairness and skills But for the win you also need a little bit of luck Once again, 50,000 people are on the move. Again, a caravan of yellow elephants wend their way to Axamer Lizum. Men's giant slalom. The big slalom slope on the Birgitsk?pfl is extremely steep. Seventy-five slalom gates spread across 1, 500 meters gives the giant slalom a very fast pace and delivers the fascinating experience of high speeds. The Austrian Pepi Stiegler applies his brilliant technique rationally and intelligently. Pepi Stiegler is only bested by two other athletes. One of them is the Frenchman Fran?ois Bonlieu, the mountain guide from Chamonix. Another calm and extraordinary athlete. Bonlieu runs the race of his life, becoming Olympic champion. The big shock of the race was provided by men's downhill gold medal winner, Egon Zimmermann. A disastrous fall turns hope into disappointment. A fall that shocked everybody. Almost everybody. He can finally relax. The Olympic Games are over for him. A very dynamic run is what Austrian Karl Schranz delivers. As the last athlete of the first round, he's left with less than perfect conditions on the slope. However, due to his skills, he takes second place. Some athletes did have difficulties standing on their feet on the mountain. This does go down smoothly. There are no medals awarded for these dangerous downhill runs. Karl Schranz, the silver medal winner of the giant slalom and Fran?ois Bonlieu. Both celebrate their medals. In front of the Olympic Ice Stadium, the sun shines for the female skaters. False start. Before excited spectators, the female speed skaters display power and grace. But also their subjugation to a single competitor who completely dominates at Innsbruck. The Russian speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova, a teacher from Sverdlovsk. On the shining track, Lidiya Skoblikova and German Helga Haase race in the 1500 meters event. Two housewives found their love for speed skating. Lidiya Skoblikova, in the left lane, is ahead, but at this point in the race nothing has been decided yet. During the next lane change Helga Haase takes the lead. But throughout the dreaded 1500 meters event, which is too long for one long sprint and not long enough for rest breaks, Lidiya Skoblikova dominates in every aspect. She makes her way across the ice with smooth but powerful movements. With her elegance she refutes the old criticism that speed skating is no sport for women. Lidiya Skoblikova won all four gold medals awarded in Innsbruck. She's the most successful participant of the ninth Olympic Winter Games. All attempts to dethrone Lidiya Skoblikova were unsuccessful. But in the final laps of the 1500 meters, you can openly see the strain, the stress these young women take upon themselves. As Valentina Stenina of the Soviet Union crosses the finish... then the American Jan Smith tumbles across the finish line. She has no strength left. Her body seems to be an empty shell. In the end the limitations for women in speed skating become quite apparent. A trip by helicopter to Seefeld. The village band is mustered for the reception. In Tyrol they certainly know how to give their guests a hearty welcome. There's no shortage of guests to see the ski-jumping event on the normal hill. The proper preparation of the sturdy jumping skis is half the battle. In Seefeld, the Finn Veikko Kankkonen climbs up for the highest jump of his athletic career. The international skiing elite is here. Style and temperament are revealed in these jumps. Former world champions Toni Seelos and Sepp Bradl reminisce on their own past. The Norwegian Toralf Engan and the Finn Veikko Kankkonen wage a solitary battle for the gold. The last jump of the competition ensures the win for Kankkonen. With the assurance of a man who's deciphered nature's secret, Kankkonen wins the gold medal. Among the judges, there's no debate. The jumper, who leaps onto the shoulders of his friends, is Veikko Kankkonen. Another great athlete is the German Georg Thoma. The athletes of the Nordic combined event showed great jumping talent. Concentrated and elegant, Georg Thoma during his last jump. The mail-man from the Black Forest edges out his closest competitor, Norwegian, Tormod Knutsen, but only beats him by a few points. Rivals in competition but friends in life, Georg Thoma and Tormod Knutsen. Until the next event, Nordic combined. The ski tracks at the train station in Seefeld. Just as small and diminutive as the skiers appear below us is man before the immensity of nature. And yet man manages hold his own against this superior force through his spirit and will. The German Roland Wei?pflog begins the course. On the ski-track, the Norwegian Arne Barhaugen, one of the strongest contenders in this discipline. Even stronger than Italian Ezio Damolin. The Austrian Heigenhauser and the Swiss Alois K?lin. Tormod Knutsen in powerful form. An unyielding competitive spirit drives him along the course. Supported by people such as the former Olympic champion Sverre Stenersen. The big winner of this event will be the Swiss Alois K?lin. The last uphill in slow motion. But K?lin missed all his chances during the ski-jumping section and is thus unable to recover the grand prize with this performance. The mail goes out. Ski, Georg! A friendly invitation for Georg Thoma. And the German skis. Though his skis don't function properly. He overtakes the Italian Enzo Perin, but cannot hold his advantage from the ski-jumping section against Tormod Knutsen. The Norwegian at the finish. Thoma during the final uphill in slow motion. He's suffering with skis that slip too much during the climb. But he still gives it his all, even though he knows he's defeated. Not only has Knutsen passed him in the Nordic combined event but also the Soviet athlete Nikolay Kiselyov. Thoma at the finish. He has overcome himself. He already wanted to give up at two kilometres. A grand achievement. It's only a matter of moments that decide an athlete's fate in sports. Tormod Knutsen, the big winner, and just a few steps away from him, isolated in his defeat, the big loser, Georg Thoma. Winning makes you hungry. Tormod Knutsen agrees and gladly accepts the novel invitation of former world champion Toni Seelos. This is an authentic Tyrolean Holzhackerschmarrn. Knutsen is familiar with this kind of food from his home in the mountains of Norway. Klavdiya Boyarskikh, more used to caviar, is not so sure. And Vladimir Melanin, gold medalist in the Biathlon discipline, won't say no to this blueberry juice. And here's the man himself, the former world ski champion. He loves the food. From sensory pleasures back to the athletic attractions. In the Olympic Ice Hall, 30 young women from three continents show off their wonderful artistic interplay with gravity. The Canadian Petra Burka. Her performance is full of momentum and self-confidence. She won't win in Innsbruck, but the future is hers. Petra Burka takes third place. Next up, Regine Heitzer from Austria. Because of Petra Burka, Regine Heitzer runs the risk of losing her second place standing from the compulsory section. The Viennese skater performs an ambitious freestyle section. Up until this small error during the double axel. Regine Heitzer's dance-like performance wins her the silver medal. Holland's ice queen Sjoukje Dijkstra. She was already Olympic champion at the start of her performance for her lead from the compulsory was too wide to be overtaken. But also the audience chose her to be the winner. Her freestyle performance was simply the best. Athletic power and elegant movements characterize the superior style of the Olympic champion Sjoukje Dijkstra. Back outside among the massive Tyrolean mountains. Below us the winter magic of the village Axamer Lizum. The race may begin. Women's giant slalom on the Hoadl slope. Christine Goitschel. Go! The race starts with an open slope. The Frenchwoman stands calmly on her skis. She finds the best line between the poles, the best connection between start and finish. Christine Goitschel secures second place, together with the American Jean Saubert... nothing could break her focus. Down to a hundredth of a second Jean Saubert reaches the finish with the same time as Christine Goitschel. Different styles but the same result. The paths to happiness are not always the same. With a drive to prove her superiority and a carefree self-confidence Marielle Goitschel starts. Nobody is able to match her skills. A great athlete wins a well deserved reward: the Olympic gold medal. Marielle Goitschel, with this performance, is nearly one second faster than Jean Saubert and her sister Christine. Nearly a full second. An enormous amount when it comes down to hundredths of a second. The same flags fly at the Axamer Lizum and Seefeld venues. But while alpine skiers dominate the former, Nordic skiers dominate the latter. Start for the 4x10 kilometre relay. A fascinating picture. Fifteen skiers battle for the lead. Even the first few meters are decisive. In the lead, the Russian Utrobin before the Swede Asph. Here's the pack of followers during the first climb. The spectators follow the athletes' lead and set out cross-country to reach the best viewpoints. The third skier of each team gets ready for his turn. In the lead is the Russian Igor Voronchikhin. The last baton pass of a dramatic race. The Finn Eero M?ntyranta and the Swiss Assar R?nnlund have taken the lead. With swift steps the athletes chase up the hill. In third position is the Soviet athlete Pavel Kolchin and behind him the Norwegian giant Harald Gr?nningen. These two were in the lead just before the last exchange, but now... The climb is causing Gr?nningen some trouble. The athletes race through an endless wall of spectators and cross the finish line shortly after each other. First the Swede Assar R?nnlund. Shortly afterwards, Eero M?ntyranta from Finland. And the last member of the Soviet team, Kolchin, in third place. A quick look over the shoulder, not out of anger, however. Four men, four gold medals but one team. RACE OFFICE The big gamble for starting numbers, a peek behind the scenes. This is where important decisions are made. Interpreting equipment facilitates communication between nations. All team leaders are present and pay close attention to the randomly selected placement of their prot?g?s. The lots are drawn by children. They determine tiny advantages that could have a huge impact. The names of the athletes are placed on big starter panels. An endless string of cars is making its way into Axamer Lizum. Some drivers would probably rather slalom down the track but the slope is way too narrow. The men's slalom event is the biggest attraction of all alpine skiing events. 60,000 spectators are gathered around the slope. A tense anticipation is in the air. Athletes say that they memorize every inch of the slope like a poem. Every difficult pole, every difficult combination, is committed to memory But it is impossible to discover every secret of the track. The great unmasking will only happen after the race. The German Ludwig Leitner. He has a chance at victory. But only a few meters after the start the slope reveals its true colours. Leitner avoids falling down and takes fifth place in the overall ranking. The Austrian Pepi Stiegler. With this perfect run without any errors he wins the gold medal. His run is the crowning achievement of his athletic career. At this time, one contender for victory is still the Frenchman Bonlieu. The camera captured the dramatic run of the athlete from Chamonix in slow motion. ...seconds. Number 15, Fran?ois Bonlieu of France, has dropped out of the race. The unerring eye of the camera of the slalom monitoring films shows the well balanced performance of the world's top athletes. But it also reveals the small errors that can lead to the loss of hundredths of a second. As a carefree outsider with nothing to lose but everything to gain, Billy Kidd wins the silver medal. Karl Schranz, who was hoping for the win after his first run and the world champion title after the men's combination event, met with the same fate as Fran?ois Bonlieu during his second run. Guy P?rillat did not have much luck during his first run. But he finished his second run with the best time. But one run is not enough in the slalom event. Only those who have performed well in both runs can win. The young American Jimmy Heuga, starting number 24, proves wrong those who believe that only skiers in the first starting group stand a chance at a medal. His certainty is just as astonishing as his technique. Jimmy Huega wins the bronze medal. Differences in style are barely noticeable amongst the world class athletes. The will to win is the determining factor. Here are our three medal winners. Only fractions of a second separated them from all the other contenders. As consolation, an interview with Michel Arpin and a sisterly kiss for Bonlieu. Born to ski, live to ski and lost without skis. That is the mantra for the ski crazy youth living in the mountains. The young people's enthusiasm doesn't need any prompting. Just give them a little age, maturity and a certain skill set and these girls and boys will grow into the starlets and stars of tomorrow. On the slope, the way is short before you take your first fall. And your first fall won't be your last, even if you try to make it past. But one consolation you can take, every new start is hard to make. What is play today is serious tomorrow. But the main thing is: Don't be scared. Specters, hideous scornful faces. All of this is part of the famous Imster Schemenlaufen. Scheller and Roller are the famous figures of this heathenish, mystic custom. Scary men with large bells on their waist symbolize the harsh winter. The nimble youth with the bright sounding bells symbolize the spring. A whirling dance where heaven and hell, life and death, winter and spring collide. Meanwhile, the ice hockey players are dancing another kind of dance. Character, commitment and drama, the fastest team sport in the word was embodied by the match between Canada and the Soviet Union. During the game the reigning king of ice hockey, Canada, demonstrated once again their former strength and glory. Goal for the Soviet Union. Such joy and excitement. This goal meant the chance to become the next Olympic champions. But Canada puts up a strong resistance. The team takes the lead twice during the match, but loses in the end to the best team of this tournament. But even in defeat, the strength of the Canadians is apparent. They only loose by 2:3. Marked by the struggle, the players in their team boxes. Still out of breath, but minutes later, they'll jump back onto the ice and fight on with all of their strength. Seth Martin, the Canadian goaltender. He's the best goaltender in a tournament filled with athletic personalities. Canada puts up an impressive fight. Under pressure, they try with all their might, continually mounting attacks on the goal of the Soviet Union's superior team. Goal for Canada by Forhan. But this victory is not enough to turn the game around. A constant give and take is the unwritten law of this tough sport. Ice hockey is not for the squeamish and weak. Ice hockey is a sport for real men. But at certain moments even tough men turn into children. Tears of joy, cries of excitement, cheerful laughter, it's all a part of the scene. The dream of the Olympic gold has become reality. But with great emotion and enthusiasm they first honour their opponents. Would their rejoicing be this great if they hadn't felt the possibility of defeat? Sometimes it is more dangerous to be the team coach than a team member. Finally a handshake with the opponent. Acknowledgement and recognition. Farewell and also an invitation to the next match. In Ice hockey you are bound into a system. Your are part of a vibrant machinery, a member of a community and not so solitary or self-reliant as the skiers. The most difficult test of strength, running technique and will is the 50 kilometre cross-country event. The coaches wait alongside the track. They give their prot?g?s comfort, they cheer them on, they keep them informed about the progression of the race and, if necessary, they lie to them. The coaches and all the spectators are present, but yet, the athletes are on their own. They're alone with their bodies and their will to push their bodies to the limit along a 50-kilometre course. During this solitary pursuit along the course all of their wishes coalesce into a single wish: to reach the finish, the finish, the finish... The protagonist at the start of the race is the Finn Kalevi H?m?l?inen. After 25 kilometres, he's almost one minute ahead of his closest competitors. One of these rivals is the Swede Assar R?nnlund. Assar R?nnlund seems to have Herculean strength. He races uphill as if there weren't already many kilometres on his legs. And here is the biggest contender, Sweden's cross-country king Sixten Jernberg. During the last 10 kilometres of the race, the drama of Kalevi H?m?l?inen's run unfolds. Burned out and exhausted he struggles to stay on track. But he already knows that he is beaten. H?m?l?inen drops from first place back to 16th place. Alongside this tragedy spectators witness the duel for victory between the compatriots Assar R?nnlund and Sixten Jernberg, who've bypassed two-time Olympic champion Eero M?ntyranta from Finland. R?nnlund is still unbelievably strong. Powerfully he rushes up the climb. That's the style of a world class athlete. But Jernberg doesn't show any signs of weaknesses either. He is getting stronger and faster and more confident. This race is about to come to an end. The Finn Arto Tiainen wearing number 1 has already crossed the finish line and won third place. The victory however will be bitterly contested. R?nnlund right before the finish. A look that reveals all the wishes, hopes and excitement of a cross-country athlete. And Jernberg, the great chaser and tracker, has overtaken all of his opponents in the last few kilometres. Even Assar R?nnlund. Jernberg was one minute faster than all the other athletes. Sixten Jernberg crosses the finish line. He remains the king of the ski track. This was his greatest birthday present. The Swede wins his fourth Olympic gold medal. It seems appropriate at this point to cast our gaze back into the past and recall the noble ideas the Greeks based their Olympic competitions on. They have nearly been forgotten, but it is worth bringing them to light again. It was believed that the dead held an abiding influence over the living, beneficent or maleficent, as the case may be. So the competitions of youth were celebrated as a form of appeasement between the living and the dead. For the sake of appeasement, people came to fill the stadiums of Olympia, Nemea and Corinth. People attended to honour the gods and their heroes. And under the Olympic flame at Bergisel, the Winter Games reach their apotheosis. The best jumpers in the world battle for Olympic victory on the large hill. Every jump is an image of man's liberation from fear and gravity. An attempt to reach for the sky. The Finn Veikko Kankkonen wins silver with two nearly perfect jumps. The Norwegian Toralf Engan won gold. He, and with him many others, achieved the goal of the Olympics: Perfection!
