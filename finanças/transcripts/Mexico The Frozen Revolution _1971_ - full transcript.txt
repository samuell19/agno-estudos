60 years after the Mexican Revolution, Mexico is preparing for a new election 50 million inhabitants,... a fifth of the population cannot read or write. This is the retinue of Luis Echeverr?a, candidate presidential... in a caravan 62 vehicles... three hundred people and thousands of posters travels to far-off in the country in this land His campaign costs Mexico many millions of dollars. Last every 6 years, the President chooses his successor. The government party make him candidate... and he wins with more 85% of the votes. The Institutional Revolutionary Party known as the PRI,... sole inheritor of the slogans of the Revolution 1910... has never lost an election... and obvious it won't lose this one. He promised land distribution. The Revolutionary phraseology, the demagoguery and deception,... cascade down over Mexicans. Long live Echeverr?a! Long live! One must believe, one has to be... this candidate will, at last long last... make dream of the Revolution a living reality. So, we say with Luis Echeverr?a... with the Constitution and the Revolution... upwards and forwards! The youth from the Mezquital Valley... to whom the Mexican Revolution... has given the opportunity to have an education... finds in you the man... who will push forward... the development and the liberation of women. We believe with you as President... Mexican women will have a greater opportunity... to broaden their horizons, and stop... being just man's companion... or the indispensable person at home. Party comrades in Actopan... and this whole region. If our party were seriously concerned... about the outcome of this election... if our opponents... truly represented... an electoral threat, may this signify... the people's renewal of its faith... on the government of the Revolution. And from the future government of the Revolution... this offering made by the people... not only of its vote but of... the highest and most enthusiastic cooperation... which springs from its faith in the future. Thank you very much, comrades... from Actopan, for this welcome. We will study all the problems of the region... and we will strive... passionately to resolve them. Long live the PRI! Long live the candidate of the Revolution! Long live the Mexican Revolution! The Mexican Revolution was the... first great revolution of the 20th century. One of the most desperate. There was hunger for bread, hunger for land, hunger for justice and freedom. Mexico was an enslaving and feudal society... where 1% of the population... owned 97% of the land. Mexican Revolution was soon betrayed. MEXICO: THE FROZEN REVOLUTION I heartily salute my compatriots... from the land of Felipe Angeles... the artillery man of the Revolution. Mexico's history has been... a struggle for ideological freedom... which now is fully consolidated. The task is to produce more wealth... and to distribute it... in a revolutionary sense. I've come to Hidalgo to tell you... on behalf of the Mexican Revolution... that the principles of the Revolution, its ideas... its team of men, in constant... renovation, are powerful enough... to allow us, with an undisputable... electoral victory... to press ahead rapidly. A moment ago I told... the people with whom... I discuss these matters... how right was the Mexican Revolution. In 1876, Porfirio D?az took power. He consolidated the control of the land... by a small, despotic aristocracy. It was Porfirio D?az who opened Mexico... to Anglo-American investments. Mexico began to play a new role... as a semi colonial country. In 1910, after 35 years of brutal dictatorship... Francisco I. Madero led... an insurrection against D?az. The conditions for a revolution were the right ones. The rebellion burned the whole country Rebel groups recruited expert marksmen... and the best horsemen. until form guerrillas that ended up defeating the army. In 7 years, that bloody struggle left... more than a million dead. Please, what's your name? Carlos S?nchez Col?n. - How old are you? - 73. Did you take part in the Revolution? Yes, I did. - When did you join in? - 1911. Tell me Mr. Carlos, What did you fight for? For the lands. Now we... see them and they are ours. What did you have before? We had nothing. We had to work... for the hacienda, as laborers. Now we work the land... with our own hands. Were you with General Zapata? In his troops, not with him. Let me tell you, it's one thing... to be with him, with the High Command... and another to be with other chiefs... fighting for the same cause. What cause was that? What were you looking for in the Revolution? To expel the hacienda owners. Why? For the lands we now own. Why did you want to expel the landowner? Because we were his slaves... and now we are free. Aren't we free now? Porfirio Diaz But the overall fall of Porfirio D?az... wasn't enough for the peasants... who wanted to overthrown his feudal regime as well. When Porfirio Diaz was defeated, Francisco I. Madero... entered the capital on June 7, 1911... as the undisputable leader of the Revolution. Behind him, there was a coalition of individuals... who only knew one another... and didn't share an ideology. Lacking an ideological tradition... they had no links to a universal philosophy. Of the many groups at the time... only the agrarians in the South... were sure much of their aim. Their leader was Emiliano Zapata. How did people call you? - The Attilas of the South. - Why, tell me? We stole cows, raped women. We were the worst for the government at the time. Since Don Francisco I. Madero... didn't deliver the distribution of lands and waters and mountains, then... we protested against him... until victory or death. Madero was just a reformist anxious to make moderate measures But the oligarchy feared and hated him. A counterrevolution was organized... and General Huerta assassinates President Madero in 1913. Huerta set up a Neo-Porfirista dictatorship. The struggle going on. In the North, General Venustiano Carranza... led the true the Army of the Constitution... against the ruling clique. The same time, Pancho Villa, General Obreg?n and Emiliano Zapata... fought against the same enemy. The people, when they learned of... the Plan of Ayala, started coming in groups to us... and they gave us all kinds of help... and food, anything we asked. The government came hard after us. They killed many peaceful people... because they helped us... they hanged them, and that favored us a lot... because there were entire towns... that went over to us. Zapatismo became the most important and famous agrarian... movement of the Revolution. The peasants found in Zapata the possibility of expressed... their demands of land and liberty. In the North, Pancho Villa's men rioted to the countryside. They were cowboys, new guys railway workers... the Villistas lacked definite class interests. Pancho Villa himself was half political leader, half bandit. Pancho Villa told them at a meeting: Tomorrow morning we'll take Torre?n. Generals, get ready the artillery cavalry officers and infantry men. Saddle up my Seven Leagues to go to Torre?n even if they're devils we'll take the town. I'm going to sing a "corrido"... about a friend of my land his name was Valent?n... he was shot and hanged on the sierra. I'd rather forget. It was a winter afternoon when for his bad luck Valent?n fell in the hands of the government. This is the song of a brave man who was Valent?n. With the fall of the cities of Torre?n and Zacatecas, Huerta's regime collapsed. General Carranza entered the capital... on 20 August, 1914. But the Revolution was greatly divided. Pancho Villa continued his rebellion... and Zapata refused to recognize Carranza. The country was in chaos. A bloody faction struggle engulfed the nation. On December 6, 1914, the forces of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata occupied the capital. Never was The Mexican Revolution more popular. But this demonstration of... the people will went nowhere. Spontaneity isn't enough to consolidate power. Now more than ever, the absence of a program... influenced the outcome. The Revolution was stillborn. If the great masses do not have as their objective the transformation of society, they fail in the seizure of power. The Bourgeoisie that does have an ideology, awaits its turn. Emiliano Zapata Pancho Villa Carranza orders divisions and,... the General Obreg?n into actions against Pancho Villa. Villa suffered a new defeat. The new working class... true support began in Carranza and Obreg?n. Later, in 1915, The World Worker House... of anarchist roots, even organized... the Red Battalions, to fight against Villa. Mexico was devastated by civil war. Brother against brother... hungry and epidemics plague the countryside. Alvaro Obregon Venustiano Carranza was the true victor... of the Mexican Revolution. His ability to manipulate political situations... returned him to the Presidency. With victory assured and previous bourgeoisie rulers satisfied. Carranza did little the carry out land reform. In 3 years, the government distributed... somethings less than 200 thousand hectares. The workers who supported Carranza in his quest for power, now went on strike and were brutally repressed. The people remained hungry... for bread, land and justice. Venustiano Carranza - Alvaro Obregon In the South, Zapata continued the fight for land. The government forces were losing the battle against the guerrilla. The only way to end Zapatism was to assassinate Emiliano Zapata. Don Venustiano Carranza... gave orders to Pablo Gonz?lez... chief of operations in Morelos... to kill general Emiliano Zapata... by whatever means. They planned a shameful act of treason. It was a plan they had beforehand, because... Jes?s Guajardo ordered to pursue Zapata in... the hills, but there they could never kill him. So they arranged for... Guajardo to surrender to Zapata... to see if that way they could kill him. We told him, "General, they'll kill you". He wouldn't listen to us. "Hey you, go in front". When he reached the portal, he saluted... two men who were on the top floor. A bugle was heard above and when it sounded... 30 men stood up behind a railing... like this... and shot Zapata. He got two shots here... the horse was hit on the leg... 7 bullets on the poor horse. Zapata still managed to pull the reins... the horse stood on two legs... but in the air Zapata expired... and fell sideways. The struggle was for land, water... justice and freedom. What do you have now? Land, freedom and justice when... they feel like it. If they don't, they don't. But whose lands are really these? - The government's. - Why? Because it owns them. The government owns the land. We just borrow them, to sustain ourselves. The Mexican Revolution did in fact redistributed... the land among the peasants, but in an unequal. 50% of the people don't have land. The rest of them 3.5 million work the lands of others. The government didn't give them irrigation, nor machinery, technical assistance or agriculture co-produced and organized. But the peasants continue to work... with the primitive methods, the 5 hectares scarce that the Revolution gave them. In the Southeast, in Yucatan... nothing there is worse than the conditions of the 500 thousand Mayan Indians. Nothing remains of the great Maya Empire. In Palenque, the jungle covers everything. Temples and palaces, imprisoned by... foliage, half submerged by a sea of vegetation. The drama, the beauty and the spirit of greatness... of the Maya are preserved in superb bas-reliefs. In Chichen-Itza, the Maya transported... statues and capstones with ropes sisal hemp. With that fiber they made traps... strong bows, wove nets... and bound their prisons. Yucatan is a great desert of limestone land... where it is only possible to grow "henequen", the sisal fiber normal is hemp. In 1875, sisal rope was used... as twine in grain-harvesting. Grain-harvesting machines ate up... millions of meters of rope. The low prices paid by US companies... for the rope could only be maintained... paying slave wages... to Mayan peasants. In 1900 the International Harvester Co. was organized by Morgan Bank... and became the principal buyer of henequ?n. The first move of this monopoly... was to lower still further the price henequ?n. The landowners to were as chained to imperialism... as their own slaves. Here, as in all haciendas... there was slavery in the time... of Porfirio D?az, during the "Porfiriato". And here, mister Gregorio Tzul... was one of those slaves. This man was a slave. He says there was the time the "fajina". They didn't get paid. There were haciendas where the "fajina" took... place in the morning and the afternoon. One worker was hanged on a tree... with rope... until he said, "there isn't any"... they didn't bring him down. When the Revolution triumphed, Alvarado came. And then there was justice... to put an end to slavery. There was no more slavery. But for Don Gregorio Tzul slavery has not ended. He's 73 years old and he still works... so as not to die of hunger. My name is Antonio L?pez Hern?ndez. I was born in Yucatan. My life has been tough. because I was orphaned while to small I began to work selling... newspapers, shining shoes... struggling to live while I grew up When I was 28, I started to make a home... and I my search for a wife. So far, we've had 11 children. 9 are alive, 2 died. - This tortilla is from yesterday? - Yes. - There's nothing else? - Nothing. Buy sugar or coffee, or something. How can I buy anything? There's no money. With stones, if we don't have money! Maria, take this to the mill, so that Don Daniel will grind it. Take it. Tell them grind it up fast. It's late. Nicely ground. And fast. I've worked here 24 years. We all have 4 hectares. Of course, while the family go largest those 4 hectares stay the same. So when more us, are the less we earn. We live in misery. There's not enough to keep us alive. It's a miracle that we're still here. There's enough to eat, even there is not enough to wear. We can't have both clothes and food. The federal government wants us to believe... that we own the land, but we only have the land, not its produce. We can't go on that way. There must be a radical change completely. We have to erase the present... and start all over, with a new system. I remove Juan and put another, but I remove them and I put them and I manage them There had to be a new organization, a new system The system that exists today is already old. Nothing but high-ranking politicians have had results. At the end of the first World War, the henequen... from Yucatan was rob and transplanted to Kenya and Tanganyika. The monopolists preferred to cultivate it in a land where men were poorer... and more enslaved even than in Yacatan. When Agrarian Reform came to Yucatan... the landowners apparently divided their great properties... and registered them under the names members of family or friends. This also happened in the rest of the country. For us from the field... the only thing that came from the revolution was a slogan: "Land for the peasants". We work the land, but we don't share in its product. He who works the land did not get the benefit of the revolution. We haven't seen it. We break the back to 5 AM to 2 PM... and never get more than beans and tortillas. And the revolution that had been to planed has been betrayed. It is frozen. Completely frozen. In the evening we only eat tortillas and coffee. We don't have breakfast. At noon we do get food. Maybe one or two eggs for the family. Sometimes my husband says: "Let the children eat. I'll just have a little flour meal". He eats and goes to work. Give me the tortillas, woman, for my lunch. Here you are. Eat, son. Eat. Don't you want to eat? I'm the one that must go hungry. That's my lot. I go hungry some days, but I live in peace. If I filled my stomach... one of the kids would die. What peace could I have? - Good morning. - Good morning. I wonder if you can do me a service. Loan me 20 pesos. Antonio, 2 days ago I gave you a loan. I can't give you more. My situation is pretty serious. I do this for a living. Next week you can discount what I owe you... and then you lend me some for the following week. If things get a little better, I'll pay off my debt. What I get now is not enough to live on. Just to avoid dying of hunger. What will you do? Discount it and then you lend me some more... for next week and so on... until things get better. We must find a solution to life. OK, I'll give you 20 pesos. Thank you very much, Iv?n. I'll pay you back next week. I'm going to write them down. Do you think government policy is wrong? From what we can see... the way it is acting... we do believe it is wrong. They don't grant us free trade, the freedom... to sell our hemp to whomever we choose. One is forced... to go through them. Even if you process it elsewhere, you have to... go to them, because nobody else buys it. If you have your little sisal hemp... and you scrap, de-fiber and pack it... you put it on a truck and say: "I'll sell it in Campeche"... the police will stop you at the check point. They started dealing it. To the poor peasants they said... the land was theirs... but it turns out they get nothing. They got good money. You can see... they improved their palaces, their houses... they party big time... they have nice cars. The poor peasant sees that and says: "Am I going to work hard... for others to enjoy? I don't think so. I'll work half a day, no more". They keep seeing the same and say: "We'll work only 3 hours. We'll go through it as quickly as we can". That's why they say that... poor peasants aren't good workers. The decadent oligarchy still preserves the French palaces built by the bourgeoisie in times of Porfirio D?az. This family, which previously on 21 haciendas. Today has they only 14. The aristocracy weeps for times gone by. Before, it was very nice, we often went... to the haciendas, we really loved the people... we took their children... to be baptized. They loved us. All our domestic staff came from the haciendas. There never were ill feelings between us. Quite the contrary. Here we never had that race thing. It was all the same to us to sit... with an Indian or a White. That thing they had in the USA... we never had it here. Thank God. They never were despised? Never. They never felt bad or anything. We had very nice stays... in the haciendas, we had good horses... we went with our friends. Why don't you go now? They're very sad now. Their life is over. Now it's only the indispensable for them not to die of hunger that's the work we give them... we can't afford to pay more. Sisal hemp has gone down in price... because of the synthetic fibers. Now they have those things... that didn't exist before. Before, every cord or rope... had to be made of hemp. How are the Maya workers like? A bit lazy, young man. They have good taste. The heat overwhelms anybody. Who wants to work in this heat? That's why they work early in the morning... until 11:30, 12 o'clock. How do you see the future in Yucatan? I've better not think about it... or I'll get hysterical! That bad? Terrible. If you don't have what to live with... outside the haciendas, you starve to death. A woman who doesn't have a small house... or a son who already works, because sons... don't manage the haciendas anymore. Did the situation change... at the time of C?rdenas, for example? With C?rdenas it was then that when things started going bad for us in Yucatan. Hemp was grown only in Yucatan. C?rdenas began to take it out of the... big henequen haciendas. The oligarchy will never forgive... President C?rdenas to bring the Mexican Revolution... and Agrarian Reform to Yucatan. During his administration, almost 18 million hectares were distributed among the people. And it tried to implement the socialist policy in Yucatan. But C?rdenas failed to organize the people to destroy the power of the oligarchy and the oligarchy appropriated the revolution for itself. - Did you vote against the PRI? - Most of the peasants, yes. Because they are seeing the reality. In the elections, here in Motul, it was found... there were certain people... close to the ruling party... who had up to 3 or 4 ballots... they could vote 4 times. They're sure to win that way. The people has lost even its fear. Yucatan is one of the most interesting cases... in Mexico's political life. Like never before in any State, the people... decided to vote for the opposition, for National Action (PAN). This forced the PRI to perform incredible acts... which we thought had been historically superseded. For example, tampering with the census... stealing ballot boxes, using the army... to keep the people submissive... to the imposition decided... by the Governor. What can you do? They have no choice, but to keep on enduring... this situation and see where it goes. There's a saying: "There's no evil that lasts a hundred years... or a body that endures it". Nearly all great Mexican fortunes are recent. The new entrepreneurs in the cities were not damaged by the revolution. On the contrary, they benefited from it. In 1925, the country was... devastated by civil war. There was death and destruction everywhere. Lines communication were destroyed. Mexico needed railroads, housing, roads and industries. The State contracted with private companies for public works. Generals and colonels of the Revolution... became influence peddlers. Intermediaries between the State and bourgeoisie. Thus, from the revolutionary ranks themselves,... a new national bourgeoisie is born. This is the new Mexican bourgeoisie Adaptable and content. They dream the North American dream. Here there's conspicuous consumption... cars, luxury apartments. Investors, foreign entrepreneurs... lend names... merchants of every kinds, lend speculators... land buyers, corrupt officials; this nascent bourgeoisie is the most important base of... support for the present government. The bourgeoisie is the one that drags and puts other social classes at the service of the regime. Workers, peasants, middle class, who do not participate in the decisions of the government, much less in the control of wealth. Development has not meant better standards of living for the population. Only for a small privileged minority that squanders the country's resources on luxury items. This increasing accumulation of capital has caused a dramatic spread of poverty. For 40 million Mexicans, luck has worsened or is simply dire. If the Mexican revolution in the first 60 years has not been able to rescue the bulk of the population from the most atrocious misery, how are we going to hope that in the next 60 years the situation will improve? The development thus conceived is inhuman. The revolutionary bourgeoisie did not solve, does not solve, and cannot solve any of the fundamental problems. To be called a revolutionary one must end the exploitation of man by man We must nationalize industries and banks, we must end privilege, we must distribute wealth, we must carry out a Social Revolution. In the South, near Guatemala. The Indians live in misery. Indian communities in Mexico have... all the characteristics of a colonial society. In the area San Crist?bal de las Casas, Chiapas... a small group of "ladinos" whites of Spanish ancestry exploit the Indians, economically and culturally. The dispossession of land from indigenous communities, fulfills the purpose of the Colonial Society. Convert them into farmhand or wage-earning. Indigenous people are excluded from development, culture, politics. They have arid lands, rachitic animals... unhealthiness, high infant mortality... and illiteracy. The "ladinos" promote prostitution and... alcoholism among the Indians. - What's your name? - Miguel L?pez Panela. - Where are you taking that wood? - To San Crist?bal, to sell it... to buy little salt, corn... some beans... and some "chicharr?n". Some meat. That's all. We can't speak, we can't write. I can't even write my name. We have 3 daughters... Dominga, Manuela... and Mar?a. We have to spruce up and fertilize the "milpa". I spend 3 months sprucing up the land. Sub-men, often drunk with white alcohol... Indians form part of the... great group of the dispossessed. 11 million Mexicans don't eat wheat bread. 9 million do not eat meat, fish, milk, eggs. 8 million wear sandals. 5 million go barefoot. 23 million live in adobe or wood huts... without bathroom or running water. Little. We eat little. We eat a bit of "pozol"... some coffee and that's it. Then to work. It's that my mom is sick.. Her body and her head ache. She can't walk or carry firewood. She can't put in the fertilizer. Nothing. We cut firewood... with slit the machete, with the ax. That's something I know how to do: Working. We sell the firewood in San Crist?bal de las Casas. and I earn 2 pesos, three pesos We cut it with the ax... with the machete... and the we carry it. I carry it to San Crist?bal. Some 18 kilometers. It's very heavy. L?pez Panela, an authority among the Chamulan Indians... is called to resolve arguments in San Juan Chamula. Because, the Indians don't confident the white authorities. We hope the woman comes. She may come tomorrow. She comes today and the donkey is detained. My husband went to work... in the coffee plantations... six months ago. Some whites took him away and he never came back. My mother cries bitterly for this situation. What am I going to do without my husband? The Chamula children learn Spanish. Horse! Chicken. Turkey. Chicken. Cat. Here we have a boy. Boy. This boy has hands... feet and head. Head. Hair. How many ears does he have? Two. The boy has... what is this? Hair. Two hands, five fingers. Add them up and there are 10 fingers. What is this? Hand. What is this? Jacket. What is this? Shirt. Button. What are we? Chamula Indians. This is the State of Chiapas. This is the Mexican flag. Three colors. Green, white and red. Pole. This boy salutes the flag Mexican. Our Mexican flag. God Almighty, I ask you... for the health of the Chamulas. Don't forsake us, your children... who are so poor and so needful of your help. We need to eat. We ask you for a good harvest let there be no draught or lack of water. Don't let the whites harm us. May all the saints bless our homes and our work. May we be happy. We are ignorant, we are blind. We know we live on this land, but... we know nothing of the government. We work the land... because that is our lot in life and they gave us this piece of land... to work, to sustain ourselves. But only the men in government know... how they do their business. We just work, we don't know how or when. The PRI exercises absolute control of the country. Long live Echeverr?a! This crowd of peasants are carried to party meeting in government trucks. They are not allowed to refuse. The press and all the information are controlled. Any agitation in the countryside... is brutally suppressed and the silence is absolute. The peasant says to himself: "I'm not going to lose my job by of some fucking elections. Anyway, the PRI will win". The party was transformed the revolution... into a firm and immovable institution,... reaches the farthest corners of the country. In Amatenango del Valle there are... 3179 Tzeltal Indians... dedicated almost exclusively... to the production of artisan pottery. They have never seen the lands that the Revolution promised them, remain in the hands develop "ladino". Once every 6 years, around the elections time... the party arrives to put up its farce... to welcome the candidate. They prepare the food, the beer, the orchestra... and wallpaper the town pictures of a man they have never seen,... who will be the deputy every town. The PRI has finally created an ideology the ideology of the poster. The poster offers the possibility of being seen... when the candidate arrives. Perhaps tomorrow the political boss will say: "You has been a good boy, Fern?ndez... I saw you raise your poster". Those who do not attend they combat them, they segregate them. The poor man does not participate who cannot... explain his absence, who soon returns to the fold. Distinguished Mexicans of Amatenango del Valle... you are Mexicans with the same rights... that all Mexicans have. The Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of... Obreg?n, Carranza, Zapata... Villa, is carried out by... the economically weaker... like you. Its goal is to have less poor people... and that the rich become less rich. We are saddened when we see shoeless children. We are embittered to know that... they don't have their daily bread. That they don't have schools. That they don't have sanitation. My role won't be to solve these problems... but to oversee that other... authorities do solve them. Those who attend get a notebook... those who don't, don't get anything. The long arm of the PRI reaches the most humble hut. The conditions of the rural population in our country... are defective right from a... nutritional point of view. First of all, their diet is poor... in proteins, rather than in calories. There's a protein malnutrition. The amount of proteins... the people eat is less... than the recommended amount... but the worst part is that those proteins... are of bad quality, because they don't have... proteins of animal origin. Mexican diet is basically made up of... of maize, beans... some fruit and some pulse... but basically maize. The people eat 400 grams... of maize per day, per person... and that is the poorest food... you can have anywhere in the world. Almost as poor as what you can get... from any herb in the fields. The working class, that once organized the Red Battalions... to fight in the Revolution... now is another base support for the government. Attendance at the May Day demonstration... is obligatory. Those who don't attend are marked as absent and punished. Unions can't oppose... any official government policy. President Diaz Ordaz Fidel Velazquez Secretary General CTM Mexican unions are free... democratic, self-determined... in its internal life, with a magnificent relationship... with the regime of the Revolution. A group of corrupt leaders prototype of treacherous has taken control... of the unions, and once inside... they have defended the policies of the ruling bourgeoisie. The Popular Socialist Party, founded... by Vicente Lombardo Toledano... as a Marxist-Leninist party... fights to strengthen the State economy... that makes it possible to advance... to fight... successfully, against foreign pressure. How do you justify the support of a Marxist... party for the candidacy of Lu?s Echeverr?a? Well, that's easy to explain in the specific case of... countries like ours... that is, developing countries... where North American imperialism... bears upon the economic... social and political life. This tactical problem has been... greatly discussed within the... working class parties. We believe it is possible, convenient... necessary, in order to have... a democratic advancement... with independence towards foreign countries... and the unity of all forces... which are patriotic, nationalistic... progressive of a evolutionary country... as is the case in Mexico. That's why our party has promoted and applied... a historical experience of the Mexican people: The national front, patriotic and democratic. That's why we find in the candidacy of Echeverr?a, fundamental... coincidences in terms of program... with the electoral platform of our party... and he also publicly accepted... our party's nomination and... stated that he had fundamental coincidences. The rest of the Mexican Left in illegality... working underground and is tiny and divided. It does not take advantage of historical opportunities, because it has not known how to overcome its petty bourgeois opportunism. Maoists, communists, trotskyists, spartacists... Promos quo-prochain, the vanguard must emerge from the struggle itself. The student movement of '68 reveals the flaws of the system... and opens a stage of popular struggles. For the first time in 40 years, the unity of workers and students frightens the Government of the Frozen Revolution, which it's brutally represses. The PRI found a new law in suppression. The students were the consciousness... of a tortured people. The image of the regime as a stable democracy... was destroyed by the bazookas and tanks. We won't back down, we'll accept the challenge... and to cut a long story short... Cueto can go fuck himself. That repression, so well known... that even the corrupt press had to retract. Because the student says we won't back down. To tell the simple truth, not meaning to bother... anyone D?az Ordaz wants to destroy... science and culture. It's true that thousands... of students took part. But it was interesting to see... the presence of, let's say... pseudo revolutionary elements... in particular, militants... of international trotskyism... spartacist and maoist groups... with ties to the US Embassy. University classrooms were renamed... Mao Tse-tung and Che Guevara. Demonstrations were presided by... pictures of Che Guevara, Ho Chi-min... just like they did in Paris. To us, in any aspects it was... an extra logical copy. October 2, 1968. 300 tanks and 6 thousand soldiers... surrounded the Tlatelolco Square. In a few hours, they fired against students... women and children. The government of the frozen Revolution with... orders from its President, Gustavo D?az Ordaz and his Secretary of State, Lu?s Echeverr?a... assassinated in one afternoon 400 persons. To make sure the glorious Olympics were never forgotten the government had 400 comrades killed Alas, Tlatelolco Square how your bullets hurt me 400 hopes snatched away by treason What do the grenadiers do when they go home? Do they love their women with bloodied hands? Those stains don't come off with soap and water I ask you, grenadier what will you use to wash them off Students walk with the truth in their eyes Nothing will stop them Neither flowers, nor bullets They bring to their dead actions, not words So that this Mexican land is never forgotten the government had 400 comrades killed.
