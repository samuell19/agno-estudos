Terrorist Group Alicorn's Hideout We're entering the building. Blue Bird Headquarters Well done. Just keep on going down to the basement. That's where they're keeping the kidnapped children. Roger. Man, Hiromi's recklessness has gone up a level. Letting them catch him so we can save the kids... He probably thinks he's invincible now that his body's fixed. Real talk though, I'm sure he wouldn't have come up with this strategy if he didn't trust Igarashi more than anyone. CHAMELEON Alicorn will be the guardians of the new world. Human mutants like us... Will keep the peace. Freeze! Watch out! Is everyone all right? Stand back for a second. You're all safe now. Don't worry. Leave them to us, Mr. Igarashi. All right, take good care of them. Yessir. How are we holding up? Is anyone hurt? We'll use this god-given power to fight against any threat that stands in our way. I'd love to see you try. Hiromi! You okay? What about the kids? Don't worry. They're all in safe hands. Somei Shunichiro, leader of Alicorn... You are under arrest. We'll see. Captain! Get back here! You're not a normal human, are you? The world doesn't need more than one group to protect them, weakling. Switch with me, Daiji! I have an idea! A devil, huh? This is the perfect chance to prove that your time is up. JACKAL Get up! Never underestimate a devil. A Vistamp? Captain, are you all right?! Operation successful. We have Somei Shunichiro in custody. Congratulations, Hiromi. Thanks to you and Daiji, Operation Baiting With All Your Heart and Soul was a success, and the kidnapped children are freed at last. What kinda awful name is that? Give me some credit. Y'all couldn't have done this without me. Are you okay? You'll get to see your parents again soon. I don't have a mom and dad. You don't? My name's Rumi. Where's Uncle? Uncle?

Heh... Oh, Hiromi! Is your treatment over already? Yes. I'm going to pick up that girl. What a workaholic. I gotta say... I didn't think your genetic research would ever get to the point of instant medical care. Color me impressed. I'm incredibly honored to hear that from the Professor Karizaki. Dr. Ichimura, your DNA Restoration Program TransAmzer could revolutionize the entire health care industry. So you're the one that helped Hiromi... That's right. His body and his age are close to matching up again. Even I was surprised at first to see that his internal age was 80. That's amazing... But he should still keep his work in moderation. And definitely refrain from transforming into Kamen Rider for the time being. I'll keep Hiromi safe. That's good to hear. Of course. Let's get back on track. Do you think you could tell me more... About these human mutants you fought? Oh, come on! Hey, come back here, you! If you don't dry your hair properly, you'll catch a cold! I don't wanna. It's annoying. That shirt looks good on you. Really? I think it's lame. Hey, that's my shirt you're talking about! Hey, over here! Oh, hey, Hiromi. Sorry for having you guys take care of her. It's nothing. I'm sure Sakura likes the playdate— I'm sorry! You're late, Uncle. You're gonna keep your promise, right? Let's go. Why did you kidnap those kids? Who knows? That doesn't matter anymore. What was that? Our comrades will initiate random attacks across the city in the next few days. So there's more of you. The world will learn about the power of Alicorn soon enough! You bastard! Didn't you want to protect the world?! Calm down, Igarashi. This is to prepare for that. I can cancel the plan, but only if you let me go back to my friends. Otherwise... There'll be a bloodbath. Uncle, I wanna go to the theme park. Uncle... Who are you? Me? Isn't it obvious? I'm Kadota Hiromi! No! Now come with me! Letting him go doesn't mean he'll actually cancel it. What do you think? We should talk to Hiromi about this first. Hello? How did the operation go? What? Did you get all the kids out? What are you talking about, Hiromi? We're here on the scene of the child kidnapping that made its rounds online. 20 minutes ago, a man was spotted trying to force a girl to follow him. Whereabouts of the girl and man remain unknown A child kidnapping in broad daylight!! Hiromi, that's... Whereabouts of the girl and man remain unknown A child kidnapping in broad daylight!! Here's a recording of the very moment. Now come with me! Whereabouts of the girl and man remain unknown A child kidnapping in broad daylight!! Video courtesy of an anonymous viewer Both the girl and man have since disappeared. Actually, we have just confirmed the suspect to be Blue Bird Captain Kadota Hiromi. I swear it's not me. What on earth is going on? I'll come pick you up. Just stay there and don't move around. No, I'm gonna go look for the girl. They couldn't have gotten far yet. Hiromi...! I'll go look for Hiromi. Wait. This is where we want to split the work. We'll let them take care of Hiromi's situation. It's okay now. Is everyone all right? Just wait a while longer. I promise I'll get you all out. You're not a bad guy, are you, Uncle...? Uncle...? - I'm only twen— - My name's Rumi. Are you really gonna save us? Can you take me to the theme park after? All right. I promise I'll come back for you. Trust me, and stay here. It's a promise. What's wrong? It's you, Uncle! You took so long, Uncle. I'm sorry. But maybe don't call me— - Let's go to the theme park! Actually, maybe we should eat something first. I'm starving. Yeah, so am I. Come on, let's go. Who are you guys? Quit giving us trouble, brat. Why don't you come along with us, eh? Those people... They're scary... Don't worry, Rumi. I'll protect you. Natsuki Detective Agency Hiromi kidnapped a girl? There's gotta be more to it than that... Hiromi would never do such a thing. Hana, I got these cakes 'cause I think you'd like them. Not the time, Tamaki. R-right... I need your help, guys. Can you please look for Hiromi? We gotta get to the bottom of this. Of course. You can leave all the dirty work to the Natsuki Detective Agency. What do you want with her? It's none of your business, so back off. It's probably best for you to take her advice. What's with these two...?! Let's go home, Rumi. Let go of me! Don't put your dirty hands on her! This way! Get in! Hey, get back here, you thief! I think we're in the clear for now. Hey, do you know what they wanted to do with you all? Huh? N-no, I don't! Oh, look! Let's get some ramen! Can't run on an empty stomach. Let's go. Thanks for the wait! It looks so good! Don't mind if I do! How is it? Yummy! We're going to the theme park after this, okay, Uncle? Maybe call me— Okay, okay. You're funny, Uncle. Please be advised: The police have issued an APB on suspect Kadota Hiromi for his involvement in the child kidnapping. Continuation of child kidnapping incident Suspect Kadota Hiromi wanted by police They're actually doing this...?! So that's it... This is what Alicorn is after... Hey, you! Forget about paying. Just take the kid and run. Sorry. Let's go. Kadota Hiromi has just been spotted with the girl at a ramen restaurant in Masaki. Continuation of child kidnapping incident Suspect Kadota Hiromi wanted by police Do you mind telling us what you saw? Please. Well, the two of 'em... It's only getting worse for him. Hana, Tamaki, and Sakura are tracking Hiromi with surveillance camera footage. I hope they find him before the police. I'm going back to the Alicorn hideout to see if we missed anything. What is he thinking? Is Hiromi really a kidnapper? Or is he just forced to be on the run? Things are getting interesting. I just need to clear Hiromi's name... Hey, man. You don't look very focused on the task. Hiromi did show up at Happy Spa to take her away, that much is certain... Ikki and Sakura wouldn't get that wrong. So you're saying it's someone else with the same face? Someone with the same face... Devils feed on jealousy. My desires are yours too. Could it be...? Hiromi's devil...? Is that why you reacted like that back then? Operation successful. What if they used a Vistamp on Hiromi and made a devil that has the same face as him, like me? But hasn't his devil already been eliminated? Everyone has a chance to spawn another devil, don't they...? That's only for the real twisted ones. A goody two-shoes like him would never. I guess we have to just ask him directly. We barely ate any of the ramen... Hey... Who picked you up from the bathhouse? It was you, I thought... Huh? But I realized it was someone else right away. I was the one who picked her up. That's... My face... Surprised at the sight of your own shadow? My other self...? What's going on here?! I'm your devil. That's right... You can call me Muramasa. Now hand me that girl. Unless you want to be a kidnapper. You're the real kidnapper! Maybe I am. But I... look just like you. Uncle! Uncle! Run, Rumi! Hurry! That's not going to do you any good. There you are! Huh? That one's my devil! He's the real kidnapper. What...?! Your devil...? So this one's the bad one, then? Then let's save her from him! O-okay! No! I'm the real one! And you're lying. That's not a good look! Stop it! Uncle's not a bad guy! Hang on a sec, you guys! Trust me. I'm the real Kadota Hiromi. Rumi. Wait, Hana! Something's wrong here. The other one also ran off. I'm sorry. He fooled me, didn't he...? We need to tell Daiji about this. Hiromi's got another devil... Okay. I see. So it really is Hiromi's devil. All right. Thank you. You're a real simpleton, you know that? Sakura ran into them. What's the problem? Don't you think there are other possibilities? Like what? We can talk about that later. The data recovery's complete. Randomized attacks aren't what they're really doing... Dr. Ichimura! It's very likely that Alicorn is after you! The only reason I can think of is they want to use TransAmzer for themselves. Are they trying to create artificial human mutants? Who are those people? I analyzed the info you gave me. I'd say they were born from spontaneous mutation and can control their bodies from a cellular level. That way, they can unleash the potential energy in us humans that we suppress unconsciously. And that's without drivers and Vistamps? Exactly. They also bypass the risk of a devil's contract. Well, in any case, we don't want any more of those guys. We're low on time. We can't afford to just sit around and do nothing. What? Let's use Somei Shunichiro as bait to lure them out. Somei Shunichiro. We're letting you go. Contact your buddies and tell them where we're meeting. It's okay. Didn't think I'd ever have another devil... Have I been a bad girl, Uncle? Not at all. But if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be a wanted criminal. You don't have to worry about that. And besides, I'm the one who should apologize. My own devil is trying to kidnap you. Does it hurt, Uncle? I've been through worse. I can fix it for you. My wounds are healed... Now everything's a-okay. What the... Hiromi?! Now, Vice-Captain Tabuchi! You won't have to suffer much longer. Really? I thought it was gonna be more fun than that! You scum...! I'll make this black and white! PERFECT WING CONFIRMED! FLY HIGH! Transform! PERFECT UP! EVIL LIVE CHARGE! WINGS FOR THE FUTURE! EVILYTY PERFECT FINISH! Now! Get up! You did your best, Daiji. But I'm taking Shunichiro. Are you Hiromi's devil...? How naïve. I'm no devil. What? Sorry for lying to you, Daiji. But I've sworn my allegiance to Alicorn. So I can become a human mutant myself! What are you doing, Daiji?! Get him! But what if he's actually the real Hiromi? I will gain further power... And protect this world! The Two Sidriver! This was supposed to be a trap, but it didn't really work out for you, huh? You really are a pure soul. I'll tell you the truth. I am Hiromi's devil. You know what that means, right? If I die... So will Hiromi. Igarashi! Take them! You okay? Breaking News Alicorn transport van attacked We're live on the scene! The leader of the terrorist group Alicorn, Somei Shunichiro, was intercepted during his transport. Let me say a few words... Breaking News Alicorn transport van attacked Blue Bird Captain Kadota Hiromi is dead. From now on, he's a captain of Alicorn! He agrees with our ideals and decided to join us for good. Breaking News Alicorn transport van attacked We shall remove anyone who dares to stand in our way! Stop us if you dare. But know that it won't be easy to defeat human mutants with the power to usher in a new era! Let's go. We have video evidence of Blue Bird Captain Kadota Hiromi being the latest member of Alicorn! He was behind the transport attack along with their other members and they've taken Somei Shunichiro away! Breaking News Kadota Hiromi joins Alicorn How are you doing, Igarashi? The girl's been spotted near Kisara. The man she's with... Looks a lot like Hiromi. Leave the rest to us. Hiromi... Come on, now. You're getting spun around like a top. I know, you don't have to rub it in. Is your trust in Hiromi... really that low? Give me some peace and quiet! Man, you're a lost cause. I'm done babysitting you. BAT I've had enough. Those Alicorn guys don't look so bad in comparison. Hey, do you even hear yourself right now? Sure. And this means my trust in you... is severed. Kagero! That's quite the clean cut. I'm sorry. Somei Shunichiro saw through my plan. And now Kagero... Don't blame yourself. Dr. Ichimura's analyzing the human mutants we captured. Maybe we'll find some clues. Right. Now's a perfect time for you to go home and take a hot soak. I can't be taking a break right now. We have to find Hiromi as— Hiromi must be doing all this for a reason. Do you trust Hiromi...? No evidence or data as to why I shouldn't. Trusting him's the best option. Prof. Karizaki... He and I... do have a bit of history. And so do you... and Kagero. Rumi. Yeah? They're trying to bring you back, right? Uh huh. It's 'cause I have the power to heal people, apparently. How long have you been there? I don't know... It's been a long time. Is that so? I'm sorry to hear that. But I heard my powers have helped a lot of people. Just a while back, I made an 80-year-old grandpa young again! Talking about this is no fun though. Let's go to the theme park. Huh? So that's how it is. Rumi... Thank you. Uncle...? What's wrong? For a man on the run... You're not hard to find. How sloppy could you get? Kagero... Tell me, kidnapper. When did that devil of yours pop out? Are you really gonna save us? I promise I'll come back for you. When Alicorn was interrogating me... Somei Shunichiro Vistamped me. That so? I really thought you wouldn't have a devil. Kagero... You bastard... If you hate me that much, then come and get me. Uncle! Are you okay, Uncle? Now then... Come with me, little lady. Are you... A bad guy...? I'm a devil, silly. What do you think? Quickly, now. Uncle! Uncle! Daiji... Where's Hiromi? Hiromi's devil's a kidnapper... Kagero joined Alicorn... Nothing makes sense anymore. Daiji... Go take a bath. But right now... People can recover from anything with a nice, warm bath. Right? Come on, take it off! Let's get this—No, let's take a bath in one go! W-what are you doing?! I can do it myself! Jeez... - Let go of me! - Come on! So Kagero left you on his own? He said I was a lost cause and wanted to join Alicorn. Do you think... He betrayed you? I've fought him more times than I can count. Give my body back to me! I'm doing everything you were too much of a wuss to do! - Enough! It's time you disappeared. - No friggin' way! You're being a little baby again. Who do you think you're talking to...?! But... He's also the one that saved me. Help me...! Kagero... Looks like you finally realized that you need me. Kagero... - Transform. - Transform! So... Him betraying me... I don't want to believe that. There you have it. That's your answer. Huh...? Vice has done the same thing for me before. Stop this! Vice... What the hell are you doing?! Gimme all you got. GIFFARD REX If he transforms one more time, then our contract together will end. And then... Ikki's memories are going to come back? Once the contract's fulfilled, I won't exist inside of Ikki's body anymore. It's been a fun ride... We've always been one. So we'll still be together. Thank you. Devils aren't very good at being honest. You know... Maybe they aren't devils at all. Not devils...? Yeah. They're like a double... No, they're a part of us. Maybe you don't do things the same way, but you and Kagero share the same goals. The same goals, huh... What's the meaning of this? Saved you some trouble. Let me join you. I couldn't protect Rumi... Can you take me to the theme park after? All right. It's a promise. I promised her... I'll do anything I can... No matter what happens to me... Are you going back to your old ways? Commander Wakabayashi... I thought you learned your lesson from your battles. I will protect this world... Even if it costs me my life! Your organs, blood, and all other values register as that of someone in their 80's. You are no longer allowed to transform into Kamen Rider! Got it? You won't protect anything by throwing your life away. But you learned your strength. You've been set back. We'd love for you to come back to Fenix. We really need your help! Unfortunately, I don't think I can. And now that you've overcome that... I will bring you back... With all my heart and soul. SPIDER You really have become a true hero. A true hero... Now prove it. Thank you, sir. What? They're dead? Yes. That's right. It's truly a shame. I'm sorry I couldn't help. Huh...? What's going on? Think...! How does this all fit together...? I'll tell you the truth. I am Hiromi's devil. Don't you think there are other possibilities? Oh, Hiromi! Is your treatment over already? Yes. Your DNA Restoration Program TransAmzer could revolutionize the entire health care industry. What if... I checked their backgrounds. Those two died years ago. What? Hiromi called me. He said Kagero took the girl and went to Alicorn. You should join him. Prof. Karizaki... Thank you! Tell Hiromi he needs to pick it up too. You're Hiromi, right? Neither of us can prove our identities. Let me through. I have something I need to do. Are you going to save the girl? That's right. I promised her we'd go to the theme park. I'm coming with you. Kagero took her away. So I'm responsible too. Do you... Believe I'm the real me? That's my only option right now. Karizaki... You never know whether to love or hate him. Let's go. The enemy— Is at the Genetic Engineering Facility, right? Just a while back, I made an 80-year-old grandpa young again! Kadota Hiromi, Blue Bird Captain. Nice to meet you. I've never seen a young man with 80-year-old internals. You're almost back to normal, Hiromi. Hang in there. Thank you. Yeah. How'd you know we were here? A devil's scent is hard to miss. Smartass. What a pain in the neck. Let's off 'em. What do you think you're doing? And the Oscar goes to Kagero. Don't tell me... This was your plan the whole time? I've had enough. Those Alicorn guys don't look so bad in comparison. If you hate me that much, then come and get me. Whatever. Nothing you do will change how this ends! Don't underestimate me! It should've been obvious. All I had to do was trust Hiromi from the very beginning. Daiji... And you too, Kagero. You should've explained your plan to me. I shouldn't have had to. But I wouldn't have gotten to the truth if it weren't for you. The truth? Yeah. That guy's not your devil at all. He's a clone made from your DNA. Are you kidding me?! Am I wrong... Dr. Ichimura? Dr. Ichimura. I had a feeling it was you. You're the mastermind behind Alicorn. Human mutants were never spontaneous mutations. They're clones you created with genetic engineering. Calling them clones is doing them a disservice. They... are the pinnacle of my research. TransAmzers. You wanted to get rid of Blue Bird 'cause we'd be in your way. So you made a clone of Hiromi. And because we saved Rumi from your prison... You made me into a kidnapper to ruin my name. That girl is the one and only god-given spontaneous mutation. If I combine my tech with her power to speed up cell division, humanity will reach new heights. Show them your true potential. Sure. I will become the real Kadota Hiromi. Let's do this, Kagero! Do this how? I thought the driver's broken. REVICE DRIVER Trust Kagero. You should be able to use this by now. As nosy as always. Are you ready, Daiji?! DEMONS DRIVER Yeah! Don't drag me down, Kagero! Look who's talkin'. MEGA BAT GIANT SPIDER COME ON! M-MEGA BAT! Transform! MARVELOUS UP! THE DAZZLING RAYS ARE SHINING! THE SHADOWS ENCROACH IN DARKNESS! CROSSING CROSSING!

GIANT SPIDER MEGA BAT Rumi...! Uncle. Defeat the monster, along with me. How could I... Possibly do such a thing?! My body... Is already fused with this monster. There's no other option, is there? Rumi! Don't give up. I promise I'll find a way to save you! It's okay. I had a lot of fun with you already, Uncle. But... I really wish... we could've gone to the theme park. Rumi... Thank you. Goodbye. RUMI! Excellent. Guys... Let's get rid of him. Hey, if we do that, the kid's gonna— Please! You two... Are the only ones who can do that now. I see! Hey, you gonna fill me in, or what?

MARVELOUS JUSTICE FINISH! Rumi... Don't worry. She's totally fine. Hey, Daiji. Wanna explain now? I just believed in the Revice Driver's ability to separate devils. And I believed you'd understand what I was talking about. Come on, guys. You had time to tell me. Shouldn't have needed to. Uncle? Everything's gonna be okay now. Let's go to the theme park. Yeah. Slowly now... For my old bones... It's been a while! All right! How does this work? Okay... Let's blast off! Ready! Yep, yep, I'm ready! Yep! Get set... We ball! Now I wanna do it again! - Hiromi!

But it's better for her that way. Devils aren't our enemies They're partners that take us to the next level They aren't perfect, they have their troubles, but that's what makes them special If there's something we're missing We can talk to our devils about it 'Cause there are things you just can't tell anyone else Oh yeah We wouldn't be humans, would we If we didn't make things hard for ourselves Smiling in the warm bathhouse Is all we need Because it can wash away our loneliness Don't forget that Revise the weakness that lies in your heart And get back on the right track You have to face it head on to improve yourself You've got it in you Love yourself
