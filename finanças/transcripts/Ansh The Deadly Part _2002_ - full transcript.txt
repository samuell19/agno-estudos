[BIRDS CHIRPING] He broke the door and entered. Don't hit me. The Commissioner is on the line. Listen, talk to him.. My brother-in-law is a minister. Don't hit me. I say! D.C.P don't dare to hit me. Or else you'll be in big trouble. Understood? Have you gone mad D.C.P Bhagat Pandey? I was mad when I wore this uniform and.. ...took an oath to perform my duties sincerely. Do you know who you arrested? His brother-in-law is a minister. Hence it took three months to prepare his file. But only three hours to arrest him. He'll be out in three minutes and you'll be helpless. His file is not in your Commissioner office or any police station. It is in the Court. Tomorrow he'll be in the Court too. From there he'll directly go to jail. I assure you that no 'Law Agent' will be able to free him. Mind your tongue. I'm your senior. If you weren't corrupt and immoral... ...then not only would I have spoken with decorum.. ...but also with respect. Do you know what the punishment for such behavior is? I have suffered before. I'll suffer now, too. But, after he is punished. I'll transfer you to such a place.. ...where police officers like you are either sold or.. ...just watch the corruption like a eunuch. You are handcuffed by bribes, Commissioner sir. And you are spreading corruption. Just shut up! Then I believe I have traced your weakness. Yes, he has traced your weakness. But his pity has saved you. Or else, your misbehavior with the Commissioner.. ...would have cost your job. Understood? It's not so easy to sack me. Yes, I will resign, if I find it's essential. Because, I'll not wear this virtuous uniform.. ...while massacring traitors like you. Hey! Mind your tongue. My name is Minister Satya Narayan. I make the Government and topple the Government too. - You don't know me at all. - I know you, very well. When you weren't a minister... ...on the footpath, you used to fix the punctures of cycles. But now, you are trying to puncture the Country. Hey Commissioner! Hasn't your department taught him etiquette? Is this the way to speak to a Minister? Right now, I am not speaking to a minister. I am speaking to an agent of crime who has come to free a criminal. But I'll not leave him. You may go now. Allow me to do my work. Don't act too smart! I'll dismiss and give you a dog's death. Understood? You uneducated brute! Know your limits and speak. I am an I.P.S officer. You can't dismiss or suspend me. But can only transfer me. Hence, before I plunge into such situations I'll be prepared to leave. - Name the place I need to go. - That's good. I'll send you to such a place where... ...the gangsters will neither allow you to live nor die. Its name is Mumbai. "Mumbai!" "Mumbai!" "Do Re Mi Fa in Mumbai." "There's chaos everyday in Mumbai."

Don't you think it's an excessive amount? - To kill him. - Okay, Guru. Pandit, call up Thadani. Once Guru had been to his office for a job. But he trapped him in an extortion case. Call him. Thadani is on line. I am Munna speaking. Guru told me to demand 100 million from you. - Hundred million? - You feel it's a huge amount? You had felt the same, when he asked you to get him a job. - Don Munna, just listen to me.. - What will you say? That you know influential people in Delhi? Before they come here, I'll have you slaughtered. Now, listen to me carefully. I'll send Pandit. Give him 100 million. You meet him and collect 100 million from him. How'll I arrange for 100 million? Don't pretend. Else, I'll slaughter you. I'll send him. I want the entire 100 million. Wait till tomorrow. If he gives it, then it's good, or else.. - I'll kill him on the spot. - Did I say so? If we kill him in the house, none will be terrified about us. He should be killed on the roads. In front of everybody. In the open market. Before that, a proper plan must be made... From market to V.T. Palton road. [SONG PLAYING ON CAR TAPE] Move. Put this in your pocket. Mumbai. Look, for what you have done, give me the statement. - Or else, I'll kill you in an encounter. - Don't do it. I'll tell you the truth. - What are you doing here? - Patil, it is.. You should have been with Munna now. Patil. - What has happened to your hand? - He has been shot. Not only his hand, but his leg too. - Who did it? - I did it. You did it? By the way, who are you to shoot him? Four gangsters killed a businessman and were fleeing. But do you have a license for this pistol? Yes. Shall I show it? Has the Government sanctioned you to wound such innocent citizens? He is not an innocent citizen. He is a gangster. Really? Do you have proof for it? I'm the A.C.P here and you are teaching me? Rane, snatch his pistol and put him in custody. I'll tell him what the law is all about.. No Rane! Both will be sacked. He is D.C.P Bhagat Pandey. Sorry, I am sorry, sir. Go write the report. She was here to file a complaint. Patil... In our department we've snakes like you everywhere. Don't get scared. I'll kick you out, at the right time. Until then put him in the lock up. And fix an appointment with Commissioner for me. Yes, sir. Please, be seated. Would you like to present that shooter directly in the Court, or prefer to have him in your custody for a few days? That'll be quite unnecessary, sir. Half has already been disclosed. Tonight I will find out whatever is remaining. - By the way, he was speaking about some Munna. - Hmmm. He is Munna. He is Guru. They are the underworld's dons and are good friends. He is Babu Bakshi. He has the support of M.P Patel. He is Govind 'Edda'. He is Minister Bhavani Choudhari's right hand. Earlier, Bhavani Choudhari and M.P Patel were in different parties. But now they are united. Yes. I read that in the newspapers.. That M.P Patel gave the support of 20 M.L.A's.. ...and helped Choudhari to form his government. Babu Bhakshi and Govind 'Edda' were potent enemies.. But as per our information, they might unify like their leaders. People are thinking that we may unite. But they are unaware that we are already unified. We are made for each other, did you understand? Pandit, may we know the reason of your presence? The person whom we had chosen for Dawoo's place is now against us. Look, leader. When we needed your support... ...for our advancement, you didn't support me. Though they were my enemies... Patel and Parmar, the parties were different too ...and helped me to form my government. Hence, I've made him the minister.. ...and Patel is my favorite. Listen, that Babu Bhaksi is one of my men. And Govind 'Edda' Mr. Choudhari's man. Though both are underworld dons and are potent enemies. Now that we have united, even they have to do the same. "O ant, I am jaggery." "Come to me if you want or I'll leave." "Hold my fair arms." "Hold my fair arms." "Quit drinking, O drunkard." Yes, I know that. Hence I am here to settle the matters regarding Guru. What I say is.. We politicians think alike.. People like you are brainless with a big sized skull! It will be very difficult to adjust with him. He doesn't understand. Like you, we don't get involved in petty things. We have our own way of dealing with things. That Inspector Sukhdev was against us. Now he is behind the bars. Dawoo, tried to compete with me in the elections. I sent him to hell. Now he might be standing over there for elections. I am little mad. And my name is Govind Edda. Who am I? - Govind Eeda. - Yes. The day you want to execute Guru.. Just tell me. Give me the commission and I'll terminate him. - Because who am I? - Govind Eeda. Your father is mad. Your grandpa is mad. - Your entire family is mad! - Calm down. I agree I am a little mad. I take a commission to play their game. People also call me as Don Babu? - The intelligent one. - You are right. We suspended that Inspector using his colleagues. Nowadays we can't trust them too. If they aren't loyal to their own department, how'll they be loyal to us? Previously, you favored Guru and now you want me to kill him? If you aren't loyal to him, how can we trust your loyalty to us? Leaders, like us are like this. Until the person is advantageous, we use them. And when we find them unnecessary, we eliminate them. Remember one day even you could be useless. Before I lose control, you better leave. Let's leave from here. Come on. Chote, eradicate Guru's shooter tomorrow. The police will think that he was shot by Munna or Guru. Okay? But where? Tomorrow D.C.P Bhagat is taking him to the Court. Kill him there. [TYRE SCREECH] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [INDISTINCT] Rane, follow me. Have you gone mad? He is Guru's shooter. Don't shoot him. Shoot randomly. See, just like this. Leave me. BHAGAT: Who is this criminal who has helped us? He is a suspended Senior Inspector, Sukhdev Singh. Patil and Rane. The day I get released from jail, you guys start counting your days. Hail India. Hail India, Sir. Yes. I am here for a very important task. Please be seated. Transfers are very common. But when I knew I had to work for you, I felt very happy and proud about it. - I know. - Then why is it that... ...when you, an honest, brave and challenging officer is here... ...an officer like Sukhdev Singh behind bars? Our limitations are only up to a police station. If the case is subjected to the Court, nothing is in our hands. Senior Inspector Sukhdev Singh has been trapped so well that... ...his case is out of reach for officers like us. He has been trapped by people from our department! Then, Bhagat Pandey, from your department, will release him. - I wish you all the best Bhagat. - Thank you, sir. Be very careful. They are very cunning. When I lost Sukhdev, I was broken. If I lose you, I'll be shattered. Don't worry, sir. Nothing will happen. Look at their faces carefully. You'll see the agony and terror. Look deep into her eyes. Mother's love is shackled in the chains of compulsion. Completely vulnerable and helpless. And she, unfortunate. Her parents married her to you with lots of hopes and dreams. What did she get? A husband who is has no one? In case you reveal facts about your associates, they'll kill you. Your rivals may kill you, if they get a chance. If you escape from them too, then the police may kill you. Please, don't kill him. He'll change. He'll reform, sir. Look, this is called mother's love. Just the thought of your death can kill her mentally. For your wife the thought of being a widow shivers her to death. Then, if you really die, think of their plight. Enough. It's too much. What's too much? Goons, Dons like you who choose the wrong path, ends up at death's door. And life passes behind bars. Your family members wait at the jail door. And for you, they go to the court thinking that you can get saved. Sometimes hopes are built or broken. But the time never ceases and just passes away without a solution. Your life will be hell and their lives will become a torture. If you get time from guns and handcuffs, then try to look into these eyes. May be from deep within a wish might arise, to change from an animal to a human. Now, my head will burst. Sir. I don't know what bad time that was when I decided to walk this path. Please save me, Sir. Help me, sir. Madam, please leave from here. I'll try my best to save him. If Sir is giving you a chance, then try your best to change. - Please take care of him. - Please don't do all that. - Greetings. - Greetings. What do you know about Sukhdev Singh? Everything. Sir, A.C.P. Patil and Rane, together they trapped him. Minister Bhavani Choudhari, Parmar and M.P. Patel, they are the mastermind. Also, Babu Bakshi also has a hand in it. - Even Guru can be involved in this. - No. Sukhdev wanted to help Guru. Sukhdev Singh, helping a criminal? Guru wasn't a criminal. Situations forced him to be a criminal. Guru's father and grandfather were both great freedom fighters. After being so well educated, his grandfather had to beg in front of politicians for a job. When he wasn't justified, he fought for his rights. Politicians got scared. Before this also a politician had an issue with a freedom fighter... ...and he had to lose his position. Hence the politicians, with the help of Thadani, compelled them to sell their property... and shift from Delhi to Mumbai. You've to take care of her, as it keeps you away from love tensions. - What's this? - She is angry with him. Hello. My name is Raj Guru. - Munna. - We've shifted here, I need your help to shift our things. Why are you staring at me like this? Can't you help him? - Thank you. - Idiots. Excuse me. My name is Rajnath Guru. - You stay in Shivaji Nagar, right? - Yes. But how do you know this? I stay next to your house. Oh! I see. - How may I help you? - I want to meet Mr. Thadani. He is a very busy man. He won't meet anybody easily. He'll definitely meet me. Because it was he who called me from Delhi. Okay. I'll talk to him. [TELEPHONE RINGING] - A Mr. Rajnath Guru is here to meet you. - Rajnath Guru. Who is that Guru? Tell him to phone beforehand for an appointment. He asked you to phone and take an appointment. Please keep these certificates with you. If you get a chance, show it to your boss. - Okay. - Greetings. I'll go in the evening for it and I'll join you after that. - How are you, don? - Why are you calling me a don? Aren't we friends? Address me as Munna. - He is my friend, Guru. - Yes. I know. His grandfather is a great freedom fighter. - We've met. How are you? - I am fine. - I've met him. - Is that so? I'll just be back as I need to make a call. Where are you going? Call up from this mobile. I'll call from the public phone. Isn't it costlier from here? God has given me everything. Don't worry. Call up from here. God gave or because you are a don? It's not easy to be a don. It's full of tensions. When I'll be a don. I will be without tension, do you understand? You all will see me that day. We'll think about it when you are a don. Guru, take this and call now. - Number. - 4462151. Hello I am Rajnath Guru speaking. Can I speak to Mr. Thadani? What? I'll not get any job? Try somewhere else? What happened? He made us sell everything, and made us shift from Delhi. Now he is telling me, there's no job for me. He thinks his father is ruling us? Give me the phone. - This is the number of that girl. - Which girl? Your neighbour. If possible fall in love with her. She is a very good girl. And you'll be free of love-tensions. Hello, Dawoo brother. Look Thadani, I'm not Dawoo. I'm Munna here. You can take a chance with Dawoo but never with me. Understand? I don't think you know that I know very influential persons in Delhi. And I know the grim reaper. Don't try to be too smart. You called him here and fooling him? I'll send him and better fix his problem now, immediately. - Understood? Else I'll execute you. - Okay. You send him here. You both will forget each other's friendship.. Hello. - You? Why are you here? - To meet Mr. Thadani. - You shouldn't have come here. - Why? Police are inside. Flee from here. - Else you'll be arrested. - Inspector, there he is! Don't move. Else I'll shoot you. Hands up. Search him. He's clean, sir. He doesn't have anything. You want money from him? What are you speaking of? I am here in search of a job. He had promised my grandpa. Who is that grandpa? In which area is he the don? Not that don, sir. He has promised my grandfather. You are pretending. - Name the don you are working for? - I don't work for any don. I stay with my grandparents, my mother and my sister. - And nobody else. - I'll show you. Take him with us. Come on. He is very innocent. How do you know him? He was here before in search of a job... ...and he has given his certificates. He is the son of a freedom fighter. A martyr's son. If you know about his prior life, even you'll know he is innocent. Thadani acted as per some politicians and... ...compelled them to come here. - What was the amount he demanded? - It was 250,000. On the phone you said it was 500,000? Mr. Sharma, why are you speaking to him with such utmost respect? Once in a while try speaking this way even with the poor. Our department hardly has time to write a complaint for them. Call Rajnath Guru. Please. - Can you please stand up? - What? I told you to stand up. Stand like this until I tell you to sit down. Sit down. Please forgive me. I hit you and you were insulted. For the poor, being insulted is a part of life. I can understand your pain. A person who has cleared his post graduation in first class... ...are forced to work under such brutal people. Could you be insulted any more than this? You are insulting me inspector. You are trying to threaten me with your English words? Hey! Mind you language. I know very influential people in Delhi. Lower your voice! Else I'll put you in the lock-up, for cheating an innocent person. And regarding the influential people, I know about it very well. Limit your influence to yourself. Else it may lead to death. You both can leave. I'll leave you till the door. - Say something. - What shall I say? Again you are silent. What are you thinking? I am measuring... The sacrifices of a freedom fighter... ...and gratefulness of a politician. Hope you are not thinking about vengeance? I am not in a position for such things. My sister's marriage is nearing. My grandpa thinks that I am going to office. And I don't have anything. - Why don't you tell them the truth? - What do I gain? Now I am the only one who is tensed. Then everyone will be tensed. At least now I can live with my artificial smile. But he will lose his entire well being. Yes, you are right. What will you do when the day of marriage arrives? Time will answer everything. Festival of lights are celebrated in bungalows and in slums. If a poor man can earn money with his sincere efforts... ...one day even he'll celebrate it very pompously. Similarly when the time arrives... ...my sister's marriage will be performed. Only God knows how and when it will be done. At any moment in your life, if you need me... ...speak to me without hesitation. Don't think I am a stranger. Why are you staring at me? For me, you risked your job and faced so many difficulties. A stranger will not do so much for me? After all, how are you related to me? It's love. People say that.. We cannot compel someone to love. It just happens. "O dear, your innocent face." "O dear, your innocent face." "I am falling in love." "I am falling in love." "There's intoxication all around." "There's intoxication all around." "I am falling in love." "I am falling in love." "I will steal you from the destiny." "I will make you mine someday." "I will steal you from the destiny." "I will make you mine someday." "I will make you mine someday." "I am sure about it." "I am sure about it." "I am falling in love." "I am falling in love." "I have stolen you from yourself." "I have protected you from everyone's eyes." "I have stolen you from yourself." "I have protected you from everyone's eyes." "I have protected you from everyone's eyes." "O dear, are you aware of it?" "O dear, are you aware of it?" "I am falling in love." "I am falling in love." "O dear, your innocent face." "There's intoxication all around." "I am falling in love." "I am falling in love." You are the ones who killed that film producer, corporator, mill owner? No. We are not involved in their killings. Kamble. Free them from their handcuffs. - No, sir. Please, forgive me. - No. - Don't do that sir... - Don't do that sir. Please sir. Forgive us. Don't kill us. Sir. Sir. Move. PATIL: Babu... please... listen to me? Didn't I inform you on time? I did it, right? Yes. But this time I wasn't aware when he had arrested them. Soon after I knew that, your men were killed, am I not informing you? At least you should've told me when my men were arrested. And I could have spoken to the minister for their release. I've told you many times to make me an A.C.P and then you'll see. How'll I do that when you can't pass on the information properly? I am dead! He didn't know anything about it. You piglet! Address me as Babu the don. That's what I called you. A child! Listen, I arrested your men day before yesterday... ...and killed them today. The day is not far when you, your Bhavani Choudhari and Minister Parmar will have a similar death. Your men revealed everything before they died. I have their... Hold this, hold this. I've their statements recorded on an audio cassette. And only I know where it is. Even my shadow doesn't know about it. How much money you want for that cassette? I'll speak to my party and will get it for you. Hey shut up, you cheater. I'll use it only to kill you. Bhavani sir, he is speaking about my death. - And you got scared. - You should've been in his seat. - You made this coward a minister. - Don Babu.. Shut up! Listen to what I say. I promised to make your party win. You've won. You had promised to save my associates. When did you save? Sukhdev has killed my men. He is speaking of my death and all of you are having fun. What can we say about this. It's all as per our fate. It's all as per our fate. If my party had made me a minister, then... ...by now Sukhdev would have been sleeping forever. I am speaking about the present not the past. I can kill him now. But I don't want the risk as he is a policeman. My entire gang and company will be in trouble. Hey Babu! There is no need to be so tensed. - I'll write Sukhdev's fortune. - Take this. Take this. Take this. I'll sit here, you finish the work. Hey, Chhote, give each of them a rifle. Give. Keep it away from me. Keep it away from me. Keep it away from me. I'm scared. - What I want to say is... - Hey you be quiet, Patel. I'll make him understand. Babu. Leaders like us don't kill. We make others kill. Not only in our country, but everywhere in this world. They earn a lot of name because... ...leaders like me are behind them. That's why? Now did you understand? You'll kill him. But only when I say so. Hey you! What's wrong with you? Why do you want irritate others? - Hey! I want to be the don. - Dinya, you are drunk. Even the police are here. There can be a problem. I am not scared of them. What can these scoundrels do? What can this Inspector do to me? Do you know me? You know who I am? Dinya the don... You want to be a don? Pandu, take him to the station. Come on. When I come back, address me as don. Hey Munna, when I am released, you have to salute me and call me don. - You have to call me don. - Come on, come on. [ENGINE REVVING] What happened, son? All was so good. Then why suddenly this chaos? - Why is Dinya being arrested? - Grandpa. Grandpa, looking at me, he also wants to become a brother. It's a very good thing. There are girls also here. They would have completed the rituals of being a sister... ...by tying the holy thread to his hand. Then even the police wouldn't have interfered. Grandpa, here the term Bhai (brother) is used in a different way. What difference can there be between here and there, child. All over India we call a brother 'bhai'. Why? The person who protects one's sister... ...one who cares for her, is a brother or 'bhai'. I'll make you understand, grandpa. What do you call the person who creates chaos, kills people? We call them mobsters, gangsters. Here he is called as 'bhai'. Wow son, wonderful. 'Dada' which means grandpa is nowadays used as a slang for 'don' Now even the word 'bhai' is not spared! Did we free the country for this? Move from here, son. It's late in the night. come to sleep. Look, you be a brother to your sister. But don't be a don for Mumbai. What did you say? - Greetings, sir. - You! Sir. Who is he? He was creating nuisance and he wants to be a don. - You are from Shivaji Nagar, right? - Yes, Sir. - You drive a taxi? - Yes, Sir. - You! - No, no. Don't hit me. Sir. Let's fix him with some pending murder cases. No, Sir. No, sir. In case he is trapped with false cases now... ...then he'll surely be transformed into a don one day. We are here to put an end to crimes, not to encourage that. He created a mess in the public place right? - No! - Yes, Sir. File a case under 53,54. If he is in jail for 10 to 15 days, then he'll change. Listen, from today if you give a thought to being a don... No Sir. - Then I'll not put you in jail, but I'll directly kill you. My name is Sukhdev Singh Encounter. Sir. I'll not even think about it. I will never become a don, sir. I will never become one, sir. Please leave me, Sir. - Hey Dinya? - Hey no Dinya! Address me as don. Scoundrel is calling me Dinya. - Dinya, coming from police.. - Call me don... Yes, I'll call you Dinya the don. [HORN HONKS] - Dinya! - Hey! - What happened to the interview? - I got it. Girls are very smart. You get jobs instantly. Look at my shoes. Look here. There's a hole in my sole. I am not in a position to fetch a job for you. But I can definitely put a sole into your shoes. When my sole completely wears out, I'll change my shoes. What? You are... - Hi. - Hi. - Ah.. Can I give you a lift. - No. We aren't going anywhere. We were just talking to each other. Okay. Bye. Bye. Why didn't you go with her? If I go with her now... Then I'll be ill-famed. [GASPS] But from the conversation I felt you know each other well. Once we were good friends. Why? Is it that you both loved a same guy and one had to sacrifice? Yes, she had to sacrifice. But not for a guy, it was for her family. Even now I want to continue with her friendship. But the situations and society will not permit that. Why? She is a beer bar dancer. Helplessness made an innocent, homely girl into a bar dancer. Her family had arranged for her marriage. Until the last moment, they couldn't arrange funds for it. And the groom and his people went back. Her father had a heart attack. Her brother committed suicide. She had to bear the entire family's responsibility. And circumstances... Snatched everything away from her. 'Her family had arranged for her marriage.' 'Until the last moment they couldn't arrange for funds.' 'And the groom and his people went back.' 'Her father had an heart attack.' 'Her brother committed suicide.' [GASPS] David, where is Munna? If he doesn't agree, then kill him. Munna! Take me to Dawoo. Something wrong with your brains? - You know who is Dawoo? - I know. Hence I came to you. I don't have any other way, other than working for Dawoo, Munna. People dream, when they sleep. And get up in fright. I've dreamt while I was awake. A very dreadful dream. Look, I don't want my sister's marriage to be stopped. There are hardly ten days left... And I have no funds. - Do something about it. - I am wanted. If I wouldn't have been like this, I would've helped you. - I have Rs.100,000. You keep that. - That isn't sufficient. They are coming from Punjab. Expenses of marriage, their stay, dowry? Please take me to Dawoo. I don't have any other choice. Look, don't get tensed. I'll give you 100,000. For the remaining amount, we'll ask Dawoo. - He has... - I don't want anybody's help. I want to prove myself. I've toiled enough for jobs. Now enough. Munna, my friend. I bind you with the oath of our friendship... - ...make me meet Dawoo. - Munna, introduce him. Don't talk about friendship for such petty things. Hey, Raju. Get me the phone. [TELEPHONE RINGING] The phone has been lifted. - Dawoo (echoing).. - Hey, Dawoo.. ...I'm Munna here. I had told you about my friend Raj Guru. - He wants to meet you. - Why? He wants to work for you. If he is a friend, then give him 200 to 500 thousand.. - Why do you want to involve him? - His sister's marriage is nearing. He is tensed. He doesn't want help, but wants to work. He wants to be independent. Get him tomorrow. [DOOR CLOSE] - Son, you have a kind heart. - Very true. You are like God for the poor. Convey my regards to everyone at home, Dawoo. Take care of yourself. Next time you visit, please do stay for 3 to 4 days. - Bless me. - Live happily. God bless you. - Okay. Keep the things in the car. - Okay, goodbye. God bless you, dear. Everybody in Mumbai calls you Dawoo. - Why do you call that wastrel 'Dawoo'? - Hey! He isn't a waste. He is my brother. He is my cousin. In Madhya Pradesh, U.P and Rajastan... ...we address our elder brother as 'Dawoo'. Even Lord Rama was addressed as 'Dawoo'. What's your name? - Guru, Rajnath Guru. - Sit. I heard your story. Sister's marriage. I can help you. But Munna says you are a self-respectful man. You take money only if you have worked for it. You are right. That's right. Even I want someone. From the past few days, I'm in bad terms with some politicians. Hence, they told the police about us and killed my men. Even Munna is wanted. You are new, nobody can recognize you. He is Kanti. I've asked him for 100 million. If you get the entire amount, then I'll give you 1 million. Your sister's marriage can be performed with pomp and show. - Have you used this before? - Yes, in N.C.C I've used a rifle. There you shoot on one's order, here it is helplessness. Man does everything in his helplessness. If he disagrees, then... Unlock it, like this... And shoot. Then I'll pay you 500,000. Your sister will get married. Down there's a car and a driver. He is new like you. You'll find the address behind the photo. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Dawoo. [TYRE SCREECH] My name is Rajnath Guru. Dawoo has sent me here. Dawoo had called me too. But with great difficulty I could arrange only 5 million. - Arrange? - Yes. I had only 3 million. I've taken a debt of 2 million. Debt? - Yes. - Where's the money? It's here. Check it out. [TELEPHONE RINGING] He gets tensed for petty matters. Munna, give the phone to Dawoo. He had taken 500 thousand to get out. Dawoo.. - Who? - Guru is online. Give it to me. - Yes, tell me. - Dawoo, he has rupees 3 million. For the remaining he has got a loan. To save his life. Don't listen to them. Businessmen say a thousand things. Shoot him. He isn't lying. He is telling the truth. He is telling the truth. I am a son and a grandson of a freedom fighters. I have seen only truth and honesty since childhood. If you want 3 million I'll get it for you. But I'll not shoot a defenseless and a feeble man. Nor will I let others kill him. God will take care of my sister's marriage. - Dawoo. Here is 3 million in full. - Sit down. When you shouted at me.. I felt as though... The old Dawoo was speaking. Once I was exactly like you. Honest and principled. Even today I am honest and follow my principles. But my profession is a bit changed now. Once I was a teacher. Very simple man, in a small village in Madhya Pradesh. Master Bhansingh, from Jalia. The entire village respected me a lot. People used to wish me and talk to me wherever I went. Once during the Dassera festival... ...yes, my own cousin... ...snatched my property and kicked me out of my own house. My mother who was very old died of a heart attack. Since I was teacher, I believed only in law and nothing else. So I sought justice through the law. But the law didn't help me. But my cousins put me in jail. They had bribed the inspector too. Those 4 days and 4 nights, I was beaten to death. Even today it pains. But I didn't feel so hurt on that day. When in front of all the villagers who respected me so much... ...an inspector said I was a thief and made me run naked. They hung me inside a well. But they didn't kill me. That was their only mistake. This was the mistake they made. When I got a chance, I killed them one by one. This was my mistake. I killed my cousins in front of their house. I killed that Inspector in front of that well. Then I fled to Mumbai. First I was a small thief, then hitman and I grew into a don. They told me that they will address me as 'Bhai.' I said, no. I was nostalgic about my village. So I asked them to call me 'Dawoo'. Because in our village we call our elder brother as 'Dawoo'. Guru, when I looked into your face... ...the teacher who was sleeping until now, woke up. You woke him. You! For your sister, your little sister, I've arranged for the marriage. Do you want to see? Come along with me. Come with me. See I have bought all this for her. Vessels. Clothes. Jewellery. What are you doing? How many times have I told her clothes and guests stuff should be separate? These greedy relatives. They come to share joy as well share sorrow. They attend the wedding too to take gifts. How many people are you expecting? The marriage party will come from Punjab. There will be 300 people. 300 people. Fine. 300 people. Why are looking at me like this? Call the manager and ask him to vacate the rooms. 250 people can stay here. For the rest 50 guests I'll accommodate elsewhere. I'll arrange everything. Just check out those. Is everything proper? Dawoo. You called me Dawoo. I'll not miss your sister's marriage. Take care of him. I'll surely come. Tell me, Rane. Any news. Bhansingh Dawoo and Bakshi are not on good terms. Dawoo has a good reputation with the people. Since he proclaimed that he would compete in the elections, great leaders are scared. And hence want to kill him immediately. Today is the right time for this, as Dawoo will be in Bakshi's area. - Why? - To attend a wedding. "Henna." "Auspicious henna." "Henna." "Henna of the beloved." "It has colored your hands." "The henna has brought color." "It has colored your hands." "The henna has brought color." "It has colored your hands." "The henna has brought color." "It has colored your hands." "The henna has brought color." "Your brother bought this henna." "Your brother bought this henna." "The has brought color along with sister-in-law." "The henna has brought color." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration in our house." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "We give permission to your beloved." "We give permission to your beloved." "That he embraces you today." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "Your tinkling bangles say that he'll come on a mare." "He will marry you and make you his bride." "He will take you home in a flowery palanquin." "He won't get upset with you and always pamper you." "There's a celebration in our house." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "Dance!" "We've come to the wedding to sing and dance." "We've brought our heart as a gift for you." "Bless us happily." "We bless that sorrow stays away from you." "There's a celebration in our house." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "We give permission to your beloved." "We give permission to your beloved." "That he embraces you today." "There's a celebration in our house." "Your beloved is going to come." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." "There's a celebration." He couldn't be here for some reason. He wants to talk to you. Sir. Look there. Bakshi's men are waiting for Dawoo. Let's wait for Dawoo. We'll subdue both together. Yes, Dawoo. Everything is fine. - Dawoo, I was waiting for you eagerly. - Keep watch everywhere. Munna is still dancing inside. You should've been here, at least to bless her. If you would have been here, then the show would've been different. - It's you, Sir? - Marriage is over? Yes. Tomorrow is her departure to in-law's house. You too depart from Mumbai. Else, I'll kill you. I'm advising you because our country owes a lot to your family. [SIREN WAILING] Stop this, nonsense, Sukhdev. Stop this! Why are you killing innocent people? Why? They were Babu Bakshi's men. They were gangsters. Do gangsters roam empty handed? Sir. One used to sell groundnuts, and the other was a cloth merchant. I told him not to kill poor people. But Inspector Sukhdev never agreed. - Hey! - Just put down your revolver. Just put it down. Put it down. Sir, he is mad. He wants to be the encounter expert. He shoots anybody, anywhere. He wants to kill anybody he likes. Sir, they fired first. - Who are you? Who are you? - I am Rajnath Guru. Okay! Once he saved you, and now you're trying to save him. - See. - Rajnath, it's better if you don't speak. They are very poisonous snakes. They can bite you too. I am CBI officer, Bharadwaj. You can say what you want in the Court. Come. [CICADA CHIRPING] Dawoo. Yes, tell me, Guru I want to leave all this and go back to my place with my family. Where will you go? Delhi? Yes? Yes Dawoo. Really? Tell me one thing... Did you think that I would tell you like those, what are their names, from the movies... Ajit and Amrish Puri, like how they say... 'Once you enter into this field, only your dead body leaves'. Is it so? No. No. I am very happy that you don't want to accept this gang-life. I was helpless and could never come out of it. There were many murder cases on me. But you? But you are clean. Your name is not black listed. Nobody knows about you. You leave. Teacher Bansingh is sending his student away. Yes, Amit. I'm Dawoo from Mumbai. A person named Rajnath Guru will be in Delhi. He wants to start a new business. Yes. Give him as much he asks for. Yes, you heard right. Fund him as much he asks for. He is my lad. I'll disconnect the phone. I know you'll prosper. You'll be well known. One thing.. From Dawoo, this pen is for you. It is that teacher's pen. Pen is mightier than the sword. Okay Dawoo. I'll leave. - Greetings. - Hey! You don't need to do that. You stay in my heart. Dawoo, what happened? Run. Dawoo! My name is Govind Edda. Dawoo! No, Dawoo! Hey Sukhiya! Don't leave them. - Sukhiya, do you have any spare gun? - Don't touch guns. Once you touch them, you'll never be free from it. Dawoo! You wanted to fight the elections. Go to hell and do the same. - Flee from here! Flee from here! - No! No! Don't be obstinate. Hey Dawoo! Why aren't you speaking? You didn't like Govind edda's bullets? Wilson! Tell me where is the spare gun? I'll teach that Govind a lesson. I am out of my bullets. AK 47 is in the cupboard. - You take care of him. - No! No, Guru! Don't do that or you'll become a part of it. Munna! Rao! Dawoo. Dawoo. Wilson! Get aside. We'll do it together. Just tell us where? Tell us where we have to go. Tell me where. He'll never tell you. Look, don. Don't call me don. Address me as Guru. Because this seat belongs to a school master. And in the Hindi language, master means 'Guru'. All right Guru. Shall we talk business? Tell me anything other than selling this nation. We have to kill a contractor. A tender was passed to build 7 flyovers. Prior to the completion of the flyover you would've built your bungalows. Those get built before the file opens. Is it so? It isn't so, Munna. Raju is joking. He is not joking, he is telling you the facts. When you know the truth, why are you arguing? Because the contractor has already given more money than he promised. He had been here. He has a family. If he is killed, then his children will be orphaned. In case we take back our support then... You'll be an orphan... Unreasonably, police will kill you. You are threatening me? I died the day I sat on this chair. Look, Guru. When you killed Govind Edda's men, then the Minister handled your case. That contractor didn't save you. Kill the contractor! Why should we fight within ourselves for a third person? Contractor is very sincere. Minister wants to kill him and give the contract to someone else. They'll make money by supplying the cheapest raw materials. Some days later, the flyover will fall down. What are you losing anyway? Innocent people of my country will be killed. When you're on the throne of violence, don't speak about honesty. Look Singh sir, circumstances made me a gangster. - But the patriot is still alive. - Think about yourself. We'll think about the nation. Because people have chosen us for it. Come. Let's leave. Don't worry, Singh sir. We are friends forever. Let him calm down, then we'll do as per your wish. Shall I tell you one thing? Don't feel bad. My heart says you should have been there in his position. Hey! Leave from here. Why do you want to spoil friendship? He is seated there as per our wish. Understood? Circumstances changed a freedom fighter's grandson... ...from an decent human being to an underworld don. Sir, Sukhdev can be released... ...if you take Patil and Rane into your custody. - Then what happened? - Then... Then Rane, hid those gangsters' guns. - And I. - Hmm. - You know what I did? - What? I proved to those Human Rights people that... ...they were innocent and not the gangsters. That did it. Great patriot will be either be jailed for 7 to 8 years... ...else he'll be treated as mentally retarded. And that too on those people's words who call themselves Human Rights. Did you understand? Sir. Sir. This.. What's it? Why are you roaming like this? Sir! Champa is making a video film all about us.. As per the instructions of D.C.P. Bhagat Pandey. - What are you saying? - Yes sir. I'll kill you. Stupid. You betrayed me. I will kill you. I will kill you. Stupid. Oh hello! Come back to your senses, Patil. Sir you've heard the testimonies as well as seen the video film. - Now the judgment is up to you. - They should be dead. Even the police wants that. But due to the press, gangsters and murderers have escaped. - Yes, he is right. Yes. Yes. - It happens all the time. Always.. Order. Order. The Court has decided that Patil and Rane are responsible.. ...for entrapping Sukhdev Singh and also for the shoot out. Hence they will be imprisoned for 3 years. We release, Sukhdev Singh... ...son of Jattedar Singh. The court is adjourned. Come. Let's go. It's a right judgement. Thank you, sir. The punishment awarded by the Court is very less. Hence I'll punish you in a way that your 7 generations will remember. Inspector Sukhdev. Call me only Sukhdev Singh, Sir. I'm no longer an Inspector. I want to give you back the position. Why? I want you to work next to me to fight corruption. As a Government official... ...dancing to the tunes of politicians? This service revolver, Which has to be used with permission and also every bullet has to be accounted for. What have you gained by wearing this uniform? When you tried to fight injustice, you were transferred! As per my knowledge, you have been transferred all over the country. But could you ever subdue the corruption anywhere? The Commissioner who takes a prompt oath.. ...was he ever successful in eliminating crime? But we are not sitting idle too. Whenever we get a chance we catch hold of criminals. Anyway, I'm not here to share my thoughts, but I'm here to make you understand that again today this country needs Martyrs Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev. Just because the name matches one doesn't become a freedom fighter. Please don't keep hopes on me. I'm fed up with this corruption. Though we call our department, 'The protector of Society', the corruption begins from there. An innocent man is treated like a dog in the police station. Not just the police station, but any government office. Municipal, electricity, food, water, telephone... People are harassed and in the end he himself gets fed up. I am telling you to break that maze in which we all are stuck. Again, we can attain freedom. British ruled us for 200 years. And we could expel them. Then why not this now? In fact we are the ones who gave them that position. We can definitely overthrow them. Being an officer, we can't achieve all this, sir. I've tried and what did I get? Imprisonment! To be a Police officer we have to study for 14 years. With one year of training and some years of experience. What do we get? An uneducated, ignorant leader? Who cheats the public or steals the election ballet-box.. ...and we are ordered to protect him? Should I salute him if he comes. Salute him when he leaves. We have to salute him all the time. I am fed up with this. I'll not salute them any more. I want everybody... ...the police force, the lawyers and the gangsters to salute me. Oh! So you wish to plunge into the underworld? I don't wish to, sir. But I have already decided it. If you've already decided, it's a waste to make you understand. But before you leave, I want to tell you one thing. Apart from this service revolver, I have my own private pistol. I don't need any permission for this... ...nor the bullets have to be accounted for. From today, one of the bullets will be for you. If I can release you from jail, then I can shoot you too. [TELEPHONE RINGING] MAN: I want to see that girl in the beer bar dancing nude. When she acts too smart.. I'll make her dance. "In the market.." "If you hold my hand in the market.. ...I will tell everyone." "O beloved, come home when everyone is asleep." "I will open the window for you." "If you hold my hand in the market.. ...I will tell everyone." "O beloved, come home when everyone is asleep." "I will open the window for you." "O beloved, I will make you swing." "I will make you sleep on a bed of flowers." "O beloved, I will make you swing." "I will make you sleep on a bed of flowers." "I will..." "I will dissolve the nectar of my lips on your lips." "I will dissolve the nectar of my lips on your lips." "O beloved, come home when everyone is asleep." "I will open the window for you." "I will serve you and pamper you." "I will give my youth to you." "I will serve you and pamper you." "I will give my youth to you." "With gold and silver..." "I will weigh you with gold and silver one day." "O beloved, come home when everyone is asleep." "I will open the window for you." "If you hold my hand in the market... ...I will tell everyone." "O beloved, come home when everyone is asleep." "I will open the window for you." [GASPS] We respect women a lot. If you repeat this again, I'll butcher you. - Hey! This area belongs to Govind Edda. - We are searching for him. We'll avenge Dawoo's death. Hey! If we come here again then this won't be a bar... ...but a cowshed or a graveyard. Understood. - Come on, Guru. - Come. Congratulations, Bajaj. Congratulations. Your movie is a super hit. Same to you. I used to pray to God for it. Look it's a super hit. Who are you? - Babu Bakshi here. Recognized me? - Yes. I know you very well. All right. I am watching T.V. People are praising your movie. - It is a good movie. - Mind-blowing. - Really a good movie. - Super hit. You'll earn at least 150 million. Send me at least 20 million. But, how will I arrange for such a huge amount, Babu? - Don't pretend. Send 20 million. - I am in great trouble. Trouble hasn't started yet. Don't try to be smart... ...else you and your troubles will be kicked out of this world. Get it. Babu, please. I'll send my boys. Hand over 20 million to them. Babu. Babu. - It was a call from Babu Bakshi? - Yes. You give me my money later on. But don't fail to pay him. You can act in movies only if you are alive. You are right. I'll try to arrange it somehow. Try your best... Sorry! Try your best... So that your death is postponed. For 200 years, you were slaves for Britishers. That's why the concept of slavery still exists. You fear the threats of gangsters. You fear them. You'll dance to the tunes of politicians. You cowards why are you still alive? You cowards.. Will just dance according to them. Dancing like eunuchs. Dance! You culprits. Dance scoundrel. Keep dancing, scoundrels. Sir. I had heard that... Inspector Sukhdev Singh neither gives bribes nor accepts bribes. Then what is this, sir? Because I need some information about the underworld. I have heard that underworld Don, Babu Bakshi has asked film producer Bajaj to pay him taxes to live? You've heard it right, sir. I've already given this news to D.C.P Bhagat Pandey. Without any bribe. Yes, he has even provided two bodyguards. But anyway, Bakshi's men will kill them. - Where? - Santa Cruz market at 10 a.m. Is it accurate? People say that a drunkard never lies. And I drink all through the day and night sir. What else do you do? Sir. I've a taxi. Sometimes the driver drives. Sometimes I drive. You drink and drive? Yes. So what? Rupees 30 fine for breaking the signal. Rupees 50 fine for driving without license. Rupees 100 fine for drinking and driving. I was once an officer, hence I get concessions. I'll talk to you later, Doble. It's hardly 15 minutes left for 10 a.m. Run. Run. Come, let's go.. Run for your lives. Run! Come on, run... [CELL PHONE RINGING] BABU: Chhote, did you kill him? Your Chhote is dead. BABU: Who is speaking? Your father! Sukhdev Singh. You'll die. And I'll kill you, Inspector. I am no longer an Inspector, Babu. - Call me don. - That's what I told, Babu. - I quit the job. - You did the right thing. - That is good news. - I'll give another good news. I've decided, only one don should survive. That's Sukhdev Singh. If you want to stay alive, then send 50 million, else I'll shoot you. What's wrong with your brains? You have demanded Don Babu to pay extortion money. I extort money from the entire Mumbai. And you want money from me. Scoundrel. You have extorted lots of money. Now, I will extort money from you. Hello. Hello. Come to the point. No one will say anything in this matter. What I am saying Choudhari sir is let me go to the spot. Before it is proved that the guys who died belonged to Babu... I mean, they are our men... I will handle the situation there. I'll prove that they are ordinary citizens. By this I can gain the trust of the people... ...and no one will doubt us. Isn't it right? I am going to the spot. Be careful, the Bhagat Pandey is a very clever man. They work for Babu Bakshi. You've asked what you wanted. But can you guarantee my life? Get aside, sir. Get aside. - I'll give you the guarantee for your life. - Get aside. I am D.C.P Bhagat Pandey. What I want to say is... What is going on here? Innocent people are being killed like dogs. Entire department is watching and having fun like eunuchs? Not like eunuchs but like puppets whose strings are in your hands. You give birth to such corrupted, illegitimate youth. And you blame us for it, either on the stage or with people like this. They are not ordinary citizens, but are Babu Bakshi's gunmen. They had been here to kill an ordinary man... ...but died, killing each other. But you may not be knowing that... ...there's another gangster's born in the underworld.. He is from your department.. Shall I tell you his name? Inspector Sukhdev Singh. - He is no longer in our department. - Why should I bother about it? DCP what I am telling you is... You know he is demanding extortion money from me? Lodge a complaint at the police station. When we nab him, he'll die like this. You're telling me to go to the police station? Me? M.P. Patel? Am I sending you to be arrested? I'm sending you to lodge a complaint. How can I take an action against him if you don't lodge a complaint? We have to take action. When I came to know there's a chaos... ...I came running to perform my duties. Good. Then, wait till the preliminary investigations. It will be easier for me to get shoot out orders against Bakshi. - Why should I stay? - Then why did you come here? To prove that the police department is sleeping and you are alert? And when we want to alert you, you want to sleep? Better you stay till preliminary investigation.. ...or else you'll prove to the public that you are Babu Bakshi's man. Who says the Babu Bakshi is my man? Forget it. Some one just commented on it. You just need to sign this. How can I sign? Better sign it fast or else you'll have to fight for your life. At least, give me a pen? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Take immediate action against Sukhdev Singh. Or else I'll take action against you. We have to take action against both. Because after this signature, even Babu Bakshi is your enemy. I made you an M.P. from a pick pocketer. First I helped you to be a M.L.A, then M.P. But now you disfavored me? - What I am saying is... - What did he do? He signed the papers for my shoot out... - ...in front of that D.C.P. - Please understand what I say? I was surrounded by people and I was all alone. He then compelled me to do it. Tell me what I should've done? Don't worry. I've called that D.C.P. - D.C.P is here to meet you. - There he has come. Where is he? Come. How are you D.C.P? - Salutations. - Salutations. - Is everything fine? - Yes. What would you like to have? Whiskey, scotch or rum? A glass of water. So that I can listen to you with a cool mind. Water will be here in any moment. But have something. No. Thank you. Why am I called here? It's nothing. I've spoken to the Home Minister. We don't have any strong evidence against Babu Bakshi. Hence the shoot out orders are canceled. I just called you here to say that you shouldn't kill him. Commissioner already informed me about this. As per the second one... ...I can't guarantee you anything. Because if he or his men try to kill me... ...I can't stand innocently and watch their style of shooting? But yes, in case you guarantee, he will not shoot me then... - ...I will guarantee. - Do you know what you are saying? - Why? - You don't have brains. How can we guarantee? Is he our relative or a friend? Or do we live with him? That's what I thought. Even people say this. Now Patel Sir confirmed it. Forget what people say. Do as we say. And what I'm saying is, if you obey us.. ...you will prosper. No. I mean, you will get promoted for sure. So I'm here to save gangsters? But the reward for it is very less. I had told you.. Everything can be bought. - Only one should know how to trade. - You are correct. What I want to know is what else do you need apart from a promotion? The way the Britishers quit our country. In the same way I want you all to quit your position. What are you saying? You know how long we've taken to be here in this position? - We've spent thousands of rupees. - So that you earn in millions. By getting involved in one scam after another. And when nothing will be left you will indulge in land scam... ...and sell this country. First you divided into areas. And now it has spread to villages. So that this will ease your trade. Name one leader who has done a useful task for the country. Or one who has recognized the freedom fighters or their families. Or who has given his money for the betterment of those families? Name at least one? What I want to say is, forget this. It's impossible for me to answer these questions. If you want an answer come to Parliament, Choudari will answer. Why do you want to pull me into this? Am I the sole one responsible for it? - Entire Parliament should answer this. - Who'll answer me there? Still there are people who are sincere and can't be bought. Even I'm one of them. I don't have any personal grudge against anyone. I am against this corrupt system. I can resign and kill a minister. Else I can be on duty and kill Babu Bakshi. Hail India! - Half kilo sugar.. - Here it is written that.. - Following are the underworld dons... - Black lentils. Babu Bakshi, Govind Edda, Guru Bhai. What did you say? Raj Guru? Not Raj Guru. It is the news about the underworld don named Guru. - He is not your grandson. - Yes. I'll meet you later. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Shoba, call Kusum. I've been waiting for long. My parents have fixed my marriage. I know. You go inside. I want to talk to her. What will you speak? You'll say that the underworld don... ...'Guru' is none other than you? The news in the newspaper is all about you? Brother, grandpa is very innocent. But I am not! He doesn't know anything. Nor does mother know about it. Grandma is ignorant about it. But I know everything. If you know, then make her understand. What will she make me understand? I live in the shadow of death. That anybody can kill me, or the police can shoot me. But one thing is very clear, I am not far from death. I love you. My conscious can't bear to make you a widow. So you better get married as per your parent's wish. No. I can't live without you. I'll die. You are talking about the future. I am speaking about the present. - I'll shoot myself. - No. - Brother - If you want me to live for some more days... ...then get married as per your parent's wish. Please. Put down your pistol. Please. I'll do as you wish. - Brother. - I'll do as you wish. Brother, she loves you a lot. Hence I'm making her understand. You always don't gain in love. Sometimes you may lose too. Take care and forget me. Brother.. Brother, at least tell us... ...what made you so helpless as to become a don? Some things are better not to be discussed. Brother. "He came to me stealthily." "He called me from the window." "He asked me to go with him." "I didn't listen to him." "He asked me what was the program for the weekend." "When will spend evening together?" "I said." "I love only on Sundays." "I love only on Sundays." "You wait for me only on Sunday." "Monday I am very busy." "I don't get time even for a moment." "What do I tell you about Tuesday and Wednesday?"

[WHISTLING] - Where are you taking me. - Come on. Come on. Come, come, come. Move. Daniya, get the flowers here. - Hold this. - What's this for? There's the solution for your love-problems. Hence I brought you here. The medicine is inside. Go inside. I am sorry. My friends pushed me. I didn't come here by myself. You haven't come. You have fallen here with the bouquet! - Even this is their mischief. Forgive me. - Is it so? Please, be seated. Why are you so scared? I agree they pushed me in, but it was insolence. But yet you are so courteous? You are the first man who is so well-behaved with me. Other people come here, with lust filled eyes... ...or to satisfy their lust. They kill me with their obscene looks. But today, for the first time... ...in your eyes I can see a respect for me. I respect women a lot. If I give you lustful looks, then I'll be unable to forgive myself. All of us have such helplessness that forces them to do things. Even you would have been helpless once, which persuaded you to be here. Where I have to sell myself! You can also say you are presenting your talent. You say that. People call me a bar dancer. Even when I used to dance in the beer bar. Now when I am on the stage, people still call me the same. This world is a theater. Here everybody is dancing. Even I am dancing. But I don't look like that. Life is making me dance in such a way... ...that this dance has no end. Then we are sailing in the same boat. Why don't we sail together for sometime in this sea of life? This is not possible. Do you know that I am black listed. I know. Your name is Rajnath Guru. People call you 'Guru'. Yet you want to walk with me? After knowing that death is not far from me? I don't fear death. Because I am not alive. I died on that day when situations forced me to be a dancer. - I know all about you. - And I know about you. I didn't receive any invitation card for Kusum's marriage. But I got the news that you persuaded her to marry. We'll not gain anything by speaking about the past life. - I am leaving. - When will we meet again? Never! It's better you stay away from me. Because the life that I am leading has no place for sympathy or love. At least give me those flowers. I am asking your forgiveness for my friend's mischief. Your friend is better than you. At least they do mistakes. You don't make mistakes, even by mistake. How are you, Doble? Sir, you didn't get any bottles for me? - Why don't you stop drinking? - Then I'll be lifeless. If you want me to give the information... ...then you need to buy me alcohol always. Don. The thing is that... ...Babu Bakshi has already transferred this hotel in his name. Now if I give away my land to you... - ...then what will I have? - Your life. But Minister Choudhari told us, that we give the hotel to Bakshi, - Then they'll never trouble us. - Yes, that is right. Yes Don. I don't speak to kids. I am a bit crazy. Hey! I wanted the hotel, but Babu took it. Minister came between us.. Babu is my friend. Now the same Minister is telling me to take the land. Why? You didn't receive any phone calls? - Yes, he had called me. Yes. - Is it so? I tried to make him understand. Don't make me understand. [GLASS BREAK] - Sign it. I am a bit crazy. - I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. - Govind Edda. Who am I? - Give me the pen. I'll do it. I'll do it. I thought my head was shot. You saved me. But why did you leave him? - Why didn't you kill him? - What's the urgency? He has acquired a lot of money from others. Yes. Now I will extort money from him as a tax for his life. I got the news that Babu Bakshi also had to be here with him. That is perfectly right. In the end, Minister Bhavani changed it. They'll have to change their plans very frequently. Because I'll be the only underworld don. And that is Sukhdev Singh. If you want, we can help you. Because to stabilize this world we need help from criminals. Yes, I know. All these petty dons are alive because of him. Since I want to meet him, I am doing all this. - If you want we'll.. - Don't call me don. Sukhdev Singh Encounter. Sukhdev Singh, if you want, I'll arrange for a meeting... ...with an opposition leader. His name is Yadav. Jumani, you were trapped by those people... ...who've always misused you. But you have come to the right place. And, you brought the right person. If he works hand-in-hand then I'll put an end to all those traitors. I think I am at the wrong place. If I wanted to serve the country, I could've been with D.C.P. Bhagat Pandey. I have done enough for this Country. Now I am here to earn name and fame in the underworld.. Maybe you aren't in the position to help me and yourself. I know I'm not in the ruling party, but I'm in the opposition party. A dead elephant is never of no use. Similarly, a defeated leader is never weak. Have a look at these cassettes. Have a look at these cassettes. These contain such information which can destroy them fully. I'm just waiting for the right opportunity. I think I am at the right place. Nobody can stop me to reach my destiny now. Munna, demand 2.5 million from that builder. - You? - I'm seeking your help. Tell me. I've fulfilled every demand of the dons because of my helplessness. - Especially Govind. - Yes. But now they want my body too. If I reject them, it is nothing but suicide. My circumstances don't permit me. My consciousness doesn't permit me to be nude in front of them.. You can go home and relax. If he wants to live then he'll never make any such demands. Govind. Me and my friends are hunting you. But I want to give you another chance. Why do you speak of a chance? Just kill him! Did you hear what Munna said? Come with me. If you try to trouble Shweta again, then nobody can save you. I was really foolish. Where is Guru? That way. Munna. Get out from here, fast. - You are running away? - Let's go Munna. Let's go. Look, our friends are being cremated. We can't even go near them. Asif would've been buried over there. And we can't be near them. And we call ourselves 'brother'? You are right. When my mother was being cremated.. I was watching it from far. Like an eunuch. I was responsible for his death. Why do you blame yourself? Death claims everybody. It just needs a reason. You accepted this kind of life to kill poverty. And I killed her! I have everything today.. But I don't have my mother, for who I did all this. Let's move. Before this fire burns our remaining happiness. Let's leave. Come. "I love you.. ...but I don't trust you." "I love you.." "I love you.. ...but I don't trust you." "I have love for you in my eyes." "I have love for you in my eyes." "..but I don't trust you." "Love is two-sided.. ...but I think only I love you." "Affection is two-sided.. ...how can I tell you?" "I love you sincerely." "I love you sincerely." "But I don't trust you." "I have love for you in my eyes.. ...but there's trust for life." "How can anyone guard memories?" "I couldn't forget you even if I wished to." "Dear, my feelings say.. ...I wish I embrace you." "I ask you in prayers." "I ask you in prayers.. ...but I don't trust you." "I have love for you in my eyes.. ...but there's trust for life." "I love you.." "I love you.. ...but I don't trust you." Today's headlines. A witness is in court against Munna and Guru. They could be arrested any time by D.C.P. Bhagat Singh. - Greetings grandfather. - God bless you, son. Why do you use the back door nowadays? Actually, grandpa.. He would have been settling some matters with our servants. I am not speaking only about today. It's almost every day. Mother and grandma are not to be seen. They have gone to the temple. They will be here any minute. When did you come from your in-law's house. After reading this. - Did you read this? - Listen, have an eye outside. Understood. - What are you both whispering? - It's nothing grandpa. Fine. Grandpa I was thinking, now that she is married... ...and we have enough money. Though the house in Delhi is no longer ours, we've one in Punjab. It was at the tip of my tongue. Even I am fed up with this busy life here. I was also thinking of going back to our village. Your job? It has served it's purpose. With this money we'll do some farming. They have arrived.. Who? - Brother, run.. - Come on! Let's leave by the back door. So you are the don 'Guru'? My Raj Guru has become an underworld don. You have broken my dreams into pieces. But why? What did I ask from you, that you had to do this? I was happy as a poor man. - Run brother. - From whom all will you run? Me? You? Police? Can you run from yourself? You shed a lot of blood. Today I'll kill you. You have played enough with this. I'll shoot you. - You'll shoot me? - Why can't I? You've already killed me. My principles, culture, thoughts everything you've murdered. Mr. Dinanath please open the door. - I'll kill you. - Let's go. Come. Wait. Wait. Sir, he fled from the back door. Come. [FOOTSTEPS] - Get the gun. - What are you doing? I'll take care of them. Leave this, get inside. What are you saying? Have you gone mad? Don't make me. Understand. I've promised Dawoo. You've a family and a future. Now leave. Go now. I said I will handle this. Munna has seen all this. Now you leave. Now you leave. You take him away. Make him understand. I will take care of it. - I am here. - Come with us. Fire! Oh, God. Why are you shooting here? Shoot here. Shoot here. This was done to save Guru. I had to die long ago. Today I'm dressed for the right occasion... Dinya don, you're fleeing from the police? Don't call me don. - I beg of you. Don't call me as don. - Don, what happened? - Are you going out? - Don't call me brother. You are my brother. Else should I call you uncle? People have spoilt the word 'bhai' Even if my sister calls me 'bhai' my breathing ceases. He could have been helpless grandfather. Yes, dear. We poor people are always helpless. Sometimes this helplessness puts us in debts or makes us lose respect. That doesn't mean we've to forget our principles and aim in life. We shouldn't forget the culture which has been inherited from our ancestors. If every helpless person turns to violence, then one day this world will be filled with dead bodies. Why did you stop? You couldn't arrest him, instead of him arrest me. I am here to enquire about some things. After hearing your words, I felt I'm in the wrong place. No. You are in the right place. You're in the right place. That idiot is my grandson. I didn't even expect that he would be a part of this corruption. I tried to eliminate him, but nothing happened! Why couldn't I shoot? Why couldn't I shoot? To use this, first you need to unlock this. Like this. We were five brothers. Two died like Bhagat Singh. Another two went along Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. They were lucky not to see the state of our Country. I was with Gandhiji. I was saved. And I am forced to see all this. But now, this non-violence follower, will walk the path of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh. - Now, all of you better leave. - No one should use their weapons. He is a freedom fighter. Now he is speaking in anger. I can understand your outrage. Control yourself. When you calm down, please visit the police station with this. Come. Minister, will you listen to me? Try to free that Patil and Rane. Shut up. Let me hear what D.C.P is saying. Our leaders try to encourage petty thieves, or helpless people and make them underworld dons. Later he'll be either killed or may go to jail. Or he'll be forced to flee from his house. To a place where he has everything but still has nothing. I made this concept clear for Babu Baksi and Govind. They agreed to reveal the names of the leaders supporting them. Did you hear that? My men are speaking against me. But you don't worry. I'll call Balvinder Singh from Haryana to kill these two. Govind and Babu. We'll tell them that no don is greater than a politician. By the time Balvinder Singh arrives here, the DCP would've killed us. It won't happen. I've called Yadav here. - Yadav? - Yes. But he is from our opposite party. He is from the opposition, not from the police or public. Sometimes both ruling party and opposition party will be at par. Didn't understand? We are people who think alike. - Sir. Yadav is here. - Hail India brothers. Hail India. Are you alone? Sukhdev hasn't accompanied you? I am here Bhavani Choudhari. Welcome. Welcome. I am happy to see you. Without uniform? I had promised you once that I'll be there to salute your dead body. But circumstances has made us meet face to face. Yadav sir. Have you mentioned the prices? Yes. It would be better if you tell them. I want 50% of all the money you earned through scams. And a M.P ticket for Mr. Yadav. Hail India. What I want to say is. You'll get both. But take care of Babu Bakshi and Govind Edda. You are politicians. You break promises very frequently. Don't try the same with me, or I will kill you. - Govind. - Don't shout. If you shout, I'll kill her. I'll tell you one thing. Your girl is a doll of glass. Check out how I'll break her into pieces. Better save your life, world is too small and I'll trace you. Don't threaten me. I am a little crazy. My name is Govind. I'll kill your lady. For God's sake, leave me. Bhagvan come here. Tell her your name. - Bhagvan (God). - Bhagvan (God). So for his sake I should leave you? This fellow? Does he look better than me? I had heard that a don respects women a lot. I have not disrespected you. I made you a stage dancer from a bar dancer? Yes, you did it. You made me dance, you earned well. My helplessness made me a dancer. I became a show piece. I never objected. But when you wanted to sell my body... Not me. It was those politicians. We can't go against them. Because they are the ones who support us. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Tell me. - Politicians ordered a hit on us. What? Just listen to me. Forget all this and hide yourself. These politicians... Raju you take care of Shweta. Wait! Let's go Shweta! Wait! Wait! Wait! Scoundrel. All of you will have an end like this. Today I am here to kill you. Tomorrow someone will be in my position. If you want to kill, then kill me. Skip your dialogues. Don't act too smart. Shoot me. Shoot me. As per the information, Guru has fled with a girl and his associates. Babu Bakshi and Govind Edda are dead in a shoot out. Sukhdev Singh is behind the most recent shootout. Then this is the result of that T.V interview. Before Sukhdev becomes the underworld don, kill him. But that day you said you were broken when you lost Sukhdev Singh? That was for a sincere officer. But now this is an order, for a professional killer. Just shoot him. [CICADA CHIRPING] Let's go? I thought Sukhdev Singh is a very brave man. But you turned out to be a coward. Like a thief. If I don't choose this way, then you'll shoot me. - Remove the things. - Nobody should move. Let me check out how good a shooter you are. Shoot me! Shoot me! D.C.P sir doesn't have a family. But you have children. - Look, don't hurt my man. - Then tell them to do as I say. Remove the things from the vehicle and keep it inside. Go. You want to keep these things and prove that I've been bribed? Come inside. I'll call the anti-corruption team here. There's no need to call. I am not here to trap you, but I'm here to show you some videos. Insert the cassette. I knew you didn't have T.V or V.C.R. Hence I brought them. Have a look. What I say is let's forget the Country and speak to the don. Government officials shouldn't know about it. Why do you think we encourage dons? For their usefulness. I want my part of money without any hassles. Yes. That's right. I want my share from the fund allotted for flood, famine and earthquake. We chase the criminals and kill them, sir. But these are the people who give birth to and raise corruption. One day they'll sell this country to make money. This I couldn't do it as an officer. Hence I had to choose this way. Here is my service revolver. I used to kill criminals. These are the handcuffs, with which I used to arrest criminals. Either you can shoot me, or you can handcuff me. I would have given you a medal, if it was within my power. You have completed your duties. Now I need to do mine. I'll make these traitors run nude on the roads. You will not be able to do anything. Until now they have transferred you everywhere. But now, they'll promote you and send you to Kashmir. The house of terrorists! So that you'll die and they'll have no obstacles at all. They can't eradicate me so soon. But I'll definitely eliminate them. I used to always make these politicians understand that they could never sack me. But if I find it necessary, I'll quit my job. And today is that day. Today I'm removing this uniform, Sukhdev. I don't want to wear this virtuous uniform while killing them. This Country needs another revolutionary. We need to begin the revolution. You are taking a step in the right direction, sir. I had previously asked you to be hand-in-hand with me. But now we also need to take steps together in this revolution. Hail India, sir! Hail India! If we could expel Britishers, ...then we can also eradicate you and attain freedom again. Today I'll begin the revolution. Young men of my country, will enjoy a better future. 'From whom all will you run?' 'Me? Police? This country? Can you run from yourself.' No! No! No! What happened Raj? I ran a lot. Now enough. From whom will I run? My sister, grandpa, police, country? Where will I run from myself? Who says you are running away from yourself? Look how close you are to yourself? - You are this close to your own self. - No, Shweta. I am not so close that you can't live without me. Yes, sir. We didn't get any money. People are lying though we have helped the flood victims. They only make false accusations. Enough! Promises upon promises.. Talks after talks. Sometimes contract money, sometimes builders money. The people who suffer know the pain. And why will they lie? These leaders are liars... ...who are bothered only about their position and their party. - What happened Guru? Whom did you shoot? - A leader who was lying. You should shoot them in their forehead and not our T.V. Now that's what I'll do. My name is Minister Satya Narayan. I don't play petty games. The D.C.P will not be transferred... ...but will be promoted and then sent to Kashmir. But until then he'll do our duties. Hail India, sir. Why D.C.P Bhagat Pandey hasn't arrived yet? We've arranged someone better than D.C.P. Bhagat Pandey. - I am the minister or it's you? - It's you, Sir. If I tell him to be here, then he has to be here at any cost. He is a patriot. You should be a little away from such people. Else, Udam Singh and General Dyer's story will be repeated. Who is this General Dyer? Is he an associate of Babu Bakshi? I'll call my men from Bihar and get them killed. A 'General' is a person from the military. In our military? We'll trap him in a false case and suspend him. He is speaking about that Dyer, who was killed by Udam Singh. Udam Singh. I've heard this name before.. Is he from our Country? Yes. And Bhagat Pandey also patriot who is walking the same path. And I fear that he may shoot you. You must tell me this beforehand. Because I want to live. Only if I let you live. Remember once I had told you... ...that I'll remove this uniform when necessary? To be an officer, we've to study so much. But only with speeches and lies you get the position. And for that you demolish mosques and in the name of temples you create revolts. British divided this country into 2 parts. But people like you broke our country into pieces. In the name of caste, creed, culture. You bring chaos. You make officers like us become your puppets. Commissioner. Why are you standing and staring at me? Arrest him. I'll do it. Definetly. After his goals as a patriot are accomplished. You can't escape. You were saying that you had joined our brotherhood. Brotherhood exists between friends or brothers! But you are people who sell your country for your position. At the border soldiers sacrifice their lives to save us. Your greed for money is making their sacrifices useless. But if anything happens to you or your party... ...you'll do anything.. You'll burn people and city alive. The government will be overthrown to achieve your goals. You'll auction this place to fill your pockets. Our neighbor has attained freedom... ...but still tries to invade us... ...because you are never free from your criminal activities. I want to ask you one thing. Is there a leader... ...who has done a few good things for our free Country? What will you say? You traitors! You have used this politics as your means to satisfy your greed. And have made this country a market place for slaves. While you are living like kings. You have accounts in Swiss Banks, bank balance, you own properties. Where will you take all these to? Where will you take all these to? Remember if an ordinary man is awakened... ...you'll neither have place to hide... ...nor will you get enough place to bury your corpse. But who'll wake this corpse? Yesterday, this was done by Mangal Pandey, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. Today we will have to start it. I am not as worthy as martyr Sukhdev, but yes, I have to respect the name that we share. Fire! Shoot them. Run. Escape. I feel that the purpose of giving the information is achieved. "From demons and traitors." "We have to fight together." "We have to move ahead." "Stop fearing." I killed everybody. Only you are remaining. Where is my pistol? The person who wanted to kill me, will bless me now. The situations had compelled him to be a don. But the blood in him escorted him towards patriotism. The change was temporary. The principles are with him forever. The principles you had taught him are reflected in him now. You wanted to bring about a revolution. It has begun. So you are those three revolutionaries? Yes. We had to begin somewhere. If an aged person like you can take such decisions.. Then why can't we? When I left that pistol in your hands... ...I had seen the glimpse of patriotism in your eyes. Let your patriotism be our strength and honor us. So that we can accept death happily. This is our last wish. Not in a dark room, but in an open place in front of everybody... ...we would wish to face death. I like your last wish. People are forgetting the way people had sacrificed their lives. Let our death refresh the memories of martyrs. The freedom fighters who had sacrificed their lives for us. People can never erase their memories. Freedom is our birthright. Whenever freedom is endangered... ...freedom fighters like Sukhdev, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru will be born again. Hail the motherland! - Hail the motherland! - Hail the motherland! "Sukhdev, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru.. ...will be born on this land again." "Sukhdev, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru.. ...will be born on this land again." "They will get freedom to us." "We trust them." "Everyone talks about the world." "World is nothing." "It is a dream, an illusion.. ...or this world is nothing." "Everyone talks about the world."
