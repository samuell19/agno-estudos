THE SPY You probably think the war is not about you. "Bill" thought the same thing. But that is not the nature of war. It forces you to choose sides. You've probably never heard of Bill, for good reason. Since everything she did was classified. But you may know her as - - Sonja Wigert. No? I'm partially to blame for her name being forgotten. It's time for Bill's story to be heard. Whether true or not, I'll let others judge. This is my version. And I'm known as an honest man. Thank you all for coming here - - to share this great day with us. I hope you can dream yourselves away for a few hours. Laugh, and celebrate life. You deserve that. Enjoy the show! Thank you. Where are our friends? Why is no one from the theater here? I'm here. It's been so lovely to have you here. I speak from my heart, as you can tell. Cheers, and thank you. Herr Reichskommissar. She's good, isn't she, Herr Reichskommissar? Goebbels will like her. I didn't realize she was such a vision. Blonde. In just the right way. Radiant. A true find, Sinding. Goebbels is coming to dinner at Skaugum this weekend. -Make sure she is there. -Of course. You could start my career. Imagine if we could live together. -Inspire and encourage each other. -Together? You and I? Thank you so very much! Do you want to be in the picture? It was an honor to have you here. Heil Hitler! They loved you! Everyone. All of Norway loves you! There's someone you need to meet for dinner. Our great dream is about to become a reality. I've just received positive signals - - that we can finally make Else! -With you in the lead and me directing. -Are you serious? Just attend that dinner at Skaugum on Saturday. I'm performing in Stockholm on Friday. Take the night train. You'll be in Oslo Saturday morning. Visa, tickets. Everything has been arranged. Vipsen? Wait! I understand, Leif. Thank you so much. Why are you leaving? Aren't we celebrating? Look around. Are these the people you want cheering you? -They're just an audience. -Sonja ... I just want people to relax and have some fun. Stay if you want, but I'm leaving. If I'm seen with this riffraff I'll be out of a job tomorrow. Report based on Norwegian newspapers. After the invasion, Hitler appointed Vidkun Quisling Prime Minister. Two weeks later, Hitler replaced him with Josef Terboven, - - who then became Reichskommissar. Terboven banned all other parties - - and introduced censorship of the free press. Rumor has it he has moved into Skaugum, the Crown Prince's residence. The consequences of this for Swedish security policy, - - I shall return to in future reports. Heil Hitler. It is clear we need an informer by Terboven's side. Lieutenant Akrell. Rumor has it the Germans may attack us. As I wrote in a separate classified report. Your luggage is ready and your car is here. -Thank you, Rudolf. -This came for you. By German messenger. Something special? Not at all. Thank you for a lovely stay. Always a pleasure, Mrs. Wigert. Kielland's Else. According to statistics, burglaries have doubled. We have protection for that in our household insurance. We were known as the C Bureau. Ostensibly an insurance company, - - but in reality a network of spies under my command. Though Sweden hadn't been invaded, - - all the warring nations had intelligence services here. Stockholm was crawling with spies, spying on us and each other. No one trusted anyone. Hi! Aren't you on your way to Stockholm? Soon. But I missed you so last night. -Oh? -Yes. Didn't you get our message? We'd never attend that German PR nonsense. Let me make you some supper. -There's no need. -You're getting so thin. I'll throw something together. Sonja ... Come. It's pathetic when a grown man has to hide to have a smoke. It's medicine, dad! Let me see. Sonja ... That filmmaker. Leif Sinding. I don't want our name associated with him. He's a damn traitor. I don't understand how you can work with him. You don't realize how serious this is. Do you mean I should put my life and career on hold, - - just because all this is happening? You always told me to seize the opportunity. Is that what you think you're doing? I'm just an actress, Dad. You can't hide, Sonja. You have to choose sides. What you have to put on hold, is irrelevant! Sonja? Sigvald? I don't want to be seen as a Nazi sympathizer. But Else is a classic, and I owe Leif my career. Calm down, Sigvald. We can't stop making films and writing books - - just because there is a war on. -Did you read the paper? Sonja Wigert, born November 11, 1913 in Notodden. Daughter of Sigvald Hansen and Carmen Kirsebom. Educated at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. She has worked as an actress since her debut at Det Norske Teater in 1934. Popular in Norway after several roles on stage and screen. Knows much of the Norwegian cultural elite. Norwegians and Germans. There are plans for a new film with her in a leading role. Her father and brother Knut have ties to the resistance movement. But Sonja doesn't seem to have any clear conviction. Why were you in Norway? Don't you understand me? Excuse me. They don't understand German. Sit down! Sit down immediately! Do you hear me? Or I'll throw you out. Damn bourgeois brat. Stand up! Show me your papers and suitcase. Get to your feet! Married to Torsten Flodén, a Swedish playwright. But it would appear their marriage is on the rocks. Laura Jonsson left their apartment shortly after lunch. Very upset. Laura Jonsson? -Sonja's dresser at the theater. -Oops. Not good. You forgot this! Not good at all. So it's my fault? Am I the bad guy now? Poor Sonja! Have you slept your way to any new roles? Get out of here. Get out! -Is she worth the trouble? -I would say so. Fluent in German and English. Conversational French. Her status, her connections, - - not least her talent, makes Sonja Wigert unique in my eyes. The government needs to wake up. It took Germany two days to invade Norway. An invasion of Sweden to forestall an Allied intervention - - is both likely and imminent. I share your concern, as does the Foreign Secretary. But this is a sensitive political issue. Want us to start a war? Dammit, look around you! The war is already here. Longitudes. Latitudes. They are mapping our archipelago as we speak. Islands, bridges, military installations. Someone is sending this information out of Sweden. Our informer Miss C believes this is a code. That "Maria" is a spy who reports directly to Berlin. Theories? Someone with family in Germany? Military background? A traveling salesman or journalist? Let's wait for evidence from your informer. Shit ... It's the infamous Trojan Horse Modernized for the fifth column Major Quisling is a parrot Who imitates to the best of his ability We appear to be peaceful lads ... This is utter garbage! You're a shame for Sweden, Karl Gerhard! The Europe that can be heard loudly proclaiming That power is right, has now received its symbol It's the infamous Trojan Horse Still playing its age-old heroic role ... Christ, who are you? Calm down, Mrs. Wigert. No cause for concern. I'm from the Swedish military. I just want to talk to you. I'm sorry if I startled you. My God! -The Swedish military? -Yes. I understand your popularity gives you access to many circles. That is very valuable in my business. So let me get straight to the point. I would like you - - to take the night train to Oslo tonight and attend that dinner. How do you know about that? Feel free to handle your popularity as you wish. But do you want what is happening in Norway, to happen here? Don't you want Sweden to remain free? The Germans are mapping our coastline to find out how to invade us. There are spies - - working on this as we speak. And the person in charge of it all - - is Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. Were you on the train? Have you been tailing me? Please. Go to that dinner. Keep your eyes and ears open. And sever all ties to my family? This is about the future of an entire nation. What will happen if they march in here? What will happen to this theater? Don't you think your dear colleague - - is likely - - to be put up against a wall and executed? I need you at that dinner. -Sweden needs you. -But I don't need you. -Please, go to Oslo. -Thank you for the flowers. Such a pity, Mrs. Wigert. For both you and us. If you reconsider: Cafe Blom. Ask for a window table. Your performance was good today. You have a talent - - for representing someone other than yourself. Allow me to introduce the film director I mentioned. -I look forward to meeting that actress. -She'll be seated next to you. This is Leif Sinding. Leif, the Propaganda Minister. It's an honor, Herr Propaganda Minister. Where is she? She'll be here. Don't worry. She'll be here. Come, come! Mrs. Wigert! -Patrik! Hi! -You look lovely. I just threw something on. Where's Flodén? You'll read about it in the tabloids. I kicked him out. The world is full of better men. You liar! I'm going to die alone and forgotten. I have the negatives from the shoot that you wanted. Yes, great. Thanks. -Join me for a drink? -I can't. -Why not? -I'm taking pictures. We'll just go like this ... Perfect! Come on. Please. Thank you! You're wonderful, but this songbird needs a drink. Maybe later. Thank you! Mrs. Wigert! Baron von Gossler! Marvelous. As always. Allow me to introduce Albert Finke. Director of Tourism. -Perhaps you have met? -No. Sonja Wigert. Albert Finke. It's an honor. I'm a great admirer of your films - - and your stage work. -Amazing! -You seem to know a lot about me. Director of Tourism. I'd also like you to meet Andor Gellert. Attache at the Hungarian embassy and ... Ambassador! Shall we dance? Her train is probably delayed. We really must sort out the Norwegian transportation system. I think I'll retire. Good evening. Give me Fehlis, Commander of the Security Police and SD. Heinrich. This is regarding an arrest. -Sigvald Wigert? -Yes. Come this way. Can you explain why? Leave her alone! Sigvald! Yes? Sigvald Wigert? -Hi. -Hi, may I have one of those? Do you have a window table? Christ ... Mrs. Wigert! My father has been arrested. It was foolish of you not to attend that dinner. Sit down. I'm pretty sure it's not your father they want. They want you, Mrs. Wigert. A star in their propaganda machine. My father has bad lungs. -Is there anything I can do? -That's what I'm hoping. "Maria". It's a code name. We believe "Maria" is the key to a game about Sweden - - we can't afford to lose. -I need a face and a name for "Maria". -How does that involve my father? The one who can free your father and lead us to "Maria" - - is Josef Terboven. But now we have to start over. We have to find a way to reestablish contact. Find an excuse for the dinner you missed. How? Let's ... help each other. Do we have a deal? There's a function at the Hungarian embassy. Many Germans and members of the Axis Powers will be there. A certain Herr Hartmann will also be attending. He's an old friend of Terboven's. They went to school together. See if you can get him to convey a plausible excuse to Terboven. How will I recognize him? He's quite short, blue eyes, and probably quite popular. Get him to lead you to Terboven. I was in mortal fear. They had blindfolded me. And they led me down in a cellar ... Frau Wigert! Why, hello there! My little nightingale. My knight. -Herr Gellert. -Herr von Gossler. -Are you leaving? -There's been a misunderstanding. This man wants to throw me out. Were you not going to sing for us later? That's exactly it! -Do you want to ruin our evening? -By no means, Herr Finke. Shall we? Au revoir! Let's find something nice to drink. I was recently invited to dinner - - by a very prominent German in Norway. -Excuse us. -Of course, Herr Hartmann. I was prevented from attending. And was unable to send my regrets. I have been so distraught. I think about it all the time. I don't know if you understand. Of course. Come! Who was this "prominent German"? You can tell me anything. It was a certain Herr - - Terboven. And I desperately wish - - I could find someone who could extend my apologies. I could mention it when I meet him tomorrow. Do you know him? Would you do that? Or ... -How about right now? -Right now? Would that be possible? So I can rid myself of this horrible conscience. Come with me. I'm so sorry to interrupt. I'm standing here with a sweet little thing who would like to talk to you. Yes. Good. Herr Terboven? It's Sonja Wigert. Your invitation was so lovely and personal. So I wanted my apology also to be personal. I was having marital problems, and ... I just wanted to let you know, - - the role of Else in ... Yes, of course I understand that there are alternatives, but ... Yes, I understand. Of course, Herr Reichskommissar. Yes. Goodbye. Very well ... Come here! No! Please. -I said no! -Mrs. Wigert! Aren't you supposed to sing for us now? Everyone is waiting for you. And your heavenly talent. Frau Wigert? She was waiting for her close-ups. We were shooting in front of a waterfall. -Sinding? -Not now. So I turn to the cameraman, and when I ... -There's a phone call for you. -Not now! She dives straight into the waterfall, and the camera wasn't even running! It's the Reichskommissar. -What did you say? -It's the Reichskommissar. Yes, Herr Reichskommissar. A screen test? Sure, that should be no problem. Thank you. Yes! So ... Be interested. Listen. Remember. Write everything down and ... Write reports, read all this? I have a screen test to rehearse! Your father has bad lungs, doesn't he? From now on - - we will do exactly as I say. Or forget about the whole thing. What do you want me to do? I want something solid on "Maria". What exactly do you want me to do? I'm sure you can figure that part out yourself. Who's "Bill"? You are. Don't underestimate him. Josef Terboven is well-read and intelligent. He may appear charming, even human. But don't forget that he is a man driven by his Nazi ideology. -Speak to the camera. -Is no one acting that part? Quiet please! Sound! Camera! And ... Action! What am I doing here? In this desolate place? I may have made some mistakes, but to end up here, in prison? No. Leif, can we ... Keep rolling. -But I feel so uncomfortable. -And action! What am I doing here? In this desolate place? I may have made some mistakes, but to end up here? In prison? When people look at me, they only see what's outside. They see a poor flea. It hasn't always been like this. My family - - is rich. My father powerful. I won't be here long. I'm here because I was forced. Like everything else in the life of a flea. I was forced! Don't you dare leave me like that! I won't have it. If you want justice ... If you want the world to be a better place, - - then you have to treat me accordingly. I'm not as ragged as I appear. And you aren't so pathetic - - that you would simply - - leave me here. You rotten beast. There is no justice, little flea. There is no simple answer to what is right and wrong. Bravo! Kielland would have been very pleased. Josef Terboven. -Sonja Wigert. -A pleasure. Are you familiar with his other work? Gift is my favorite book. Gift? Poison, yes. I'm reading it now. Perhaps we could discuss this further over dinner? May I send a car this evening? Yes. Goodbye. Herr Reichskommissar. Hi, Sigrid! Nice to see you. -Mr. Gleditsch. -Are you back? -Why didn't you warn me? -Vipsen. Join us! Yes, well ... Mr. Gleditsch! What a pleasure. Congratulations on all your success up in Trondheim. I have heard rave reviews. -How are things going? -Fine. What is not fine, is that I heard - - you dragged Vipsen to a Nazi party the other day. And you don't seem at all ashamed, either. Traipsing around with that bastard Sinding. -Are you here with him? -Sucking up to those Nazis! It will stick to your name when the tide turns. If you still have a name, that is. It was nice to see you. Henry. -What are you doing? -Vibeke. "Vibeke"? This is Müller-Scheld. The German cultural attache to Norway. This will be a major production. The biggest in Norwegian history. But, Mrs. Wigert ... It comes with significant responsibility, - - if you are to be our Else. We aren't simply recruiting an actress. Whoever gets this part, will also be our public face. Working for cooperation between the Norwegian people and the Third Reich. She shall be the embodiment of the National Socialist movement. Are you as enthusiastic as we are? Of course she is. Do you share our ideology? Our ideas about the future? Of course. I'd like to hear it from Frau Wigert herself. Tell me, - - Herr Müller-Scheld. Are you a Christian? Christian? Yes. -Do you believe in God? -What does that have to do with this? Prove it. That you believe in God. -I can't. -Exactly. Just like I can't prove what I believe in. I'm on your side. You just have to take my word for it. Let's drink to that. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler! "The Allies complain about the coastline ..." "They complain all the time." "The coastline Germany has acquired." "France, Spain." "The Allies complain all the time." Frau Wigert! Reichskommissar Terboven. -Have you been here before? -Never. There was a certain elegance when I took over. Now it's a bit more ... sophisticated, wouldn't you say? Yes. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Have a seat, Frau Wigert. -Please call me Sonja. Very well. Sonja. Josef. -Please. -Thank you. -Here's to Kielland. -To Kielland. Kielland. Do you think the two of us could get along? Perhaps. Perhaps not. -Are you hungry? -Yes. Come. But the Allies complain all the time. Sonja. May I ask for a favor? I don't want this evening to be about politics. That's my job. Tonight I'm off duty. What do you want this evening to be about? I am always honest. And I want us to be honest with each other. I have nothing against honesty. Why are you here? I wanted to meet you, since I didn't get the chance last time. And I really want - - Else to happen. The role as ... Start over. Why are you really here? I'm also hoping you can help free my father. He isn't well, and I don't know how much prison time he can take. He is an elderly man. It is late. Yes. I have prepared a room for you. -Please make yourself at home. -Thank you. This is lovely. Yes, that's ... If you want. I think I can get him to trust me. Terboven knows there are many German sympathizers in Sweden, - - but he didn't mention any details. I think he expected Sweden to defend Norway. Why didn't you? That's not for me to answer. I haven't heard anything about occupying Sweden, - - but I doubt they would tolerate rampant anti-German propaganda. Terboven is indignant about how the Germans are presented in the media. Good. We should give him something. Tell him Sweden is mobilizing. -Are you? -I'll put something together. False information? Won't that put me in danger? Will that get my father out of prison? If they ... It's an order, Mrs. Wigert. Until next time. No! -Damn! -No! I don't believe it! A fantastic shot. Here they are. Apple! What does Berlin know about the situation here? We will appear weak, cowardly, - - if we sit still and wait to see if they mobilize. There is no mobilization in Sweden. There are only rumors. I am well-informed about the situation. Sweden will not act. They may be right. Darling ... What would you know? A relative of mine in Värmland was called up. What did I tell you? They're mobilizing! Yes, but they call it - - "organizing." He told me he brought his rifle and helmet. Is that so? -Yes. -So it's not simply rumors. And he told you personally? When did he get his rifle? I can only tell you what he told me. I didn't mean to start an argument. You already have. Who did you speak to? The question is: How long can we allow this, - - now that we know it's happening? What does an actress know about war? Herr Reichskommissar, no one doubts you. Gentlemen, time to wrap things up. Sonja ... Your car is waiting outside. I'm ... Sonja, I didn't mean it like that. Of course you're allowed your own opinions. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Please stay. Well done! Stop, stop. Get off. Now ... No! You're bleeding! Should I call a doctor? No, no doctor. It's just a scratch. Oh my. That was stupid. True. T. wants to meet more frequently. He can get a visa on short notice - - and wants to meet me as soon as we wrap for the day. The shoot is moving slowly. I don't like the changes the Germans force Sinding to make, - - but I don't want to make the situation worse for him. T. visits the studio now and then. No, we can't change that! July 24. T. worries that Sweden won't defend itself against an English invasion. This is being discussed with Berlin. Eight German officers came to visit. They bragged about new conquests and their superiority. T. is convinced the war will be over within eight months. T. is furious about the sabotage in Trondheim. He fears the resistance and has ordered a doubling of police efforts. Convinced someone was stealing silverware, - - he sent a housekeeper to the front as punishment. He does such things when he loses his temper. July 31. I think I'll be able to maintain my "special" relationship with T. If the opportunity arises, I'll raise the issue of my father. It's risky, but I can't wait any longer. Not only because of his health, but for my own sake. I have become someone else. I hope I can find back to myself once this is all over. Still no news about "Maria". Bill. Excuse me, Josef. Do you have a minute? Could I have a word with you? Please sit. I have consulted with Fehlis and the Gestapo commanders. They agree with me, but I want to hear your opinion. Those damn saboteurs - - in Trondheim. I refuse to turn them into war heroes. And I will, if I punish them. I see your problem. Tomorrow the Norwegian people - - will become acquainted with new and necessary measures. What kind of measures? Executions. If they spit in our open hand, - - we have no choice - - but to bring them to their knees. But don't you run the risk of having the opposite effect? Strengthening the spirit of resistance? Yes, that is exactly my point. They will become fallen heroes - - of the resistance. That doesn't help me at all. I need to attack the problem at the core. The spiritual movers. The intellectuals. The journalists. The Communist agitators help fan the flame. We must make an example of the leaders. Here's what I'll do: I'll take some of the central figures out. But I will let everyone know the real reason. -Sabotage. -You will never be forgiven. I know. There must be another way. These issues give me such a headache! I'm sorry. What was on your mind, darling? Nothing. Nothing. Sonja? What is it? Just a dream. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. We ... We're letting your father go. Can you do me a small favor? Of course. Can you spy for me in Sweden? Mhm. My little spy. Vipsen? They took Gleditsch. He's dead. What are you saying? They executed him - - and nine others in Trondheim. Innocent people. Just like that. Heinrich Fehlis. Commander of the Security Police and SD in Norway. Where is Josef? He has a war to take care of. Up north. Get dressed and come with me. Miss Wigert, it will be a great pleasure to work with you. The car is waiting. Five minutes. Not everyone exercises such influence over the Reichskommissar. Don't you want to get out and greet him? If you hurry, you can catch him before he boards the train. Go ahead. Get out. I want to see this. I love happy endings. Go back to Stockholm, Sonja Wigert. There you will meet our contact. -He'll ask if you want to walk your dog. -My dog? Then he will give you more information on the details of your mission. That's all you need to know for now. Dear mother. I hope father is better, and that his lungs are improving. I miss you. Deeply. I wish I could explain more than I can. But believe me, there is an explanation for everything. Please tell father not to arrange or participate in any resistance activity. I know how he will react, - - but the situation is extra sensitive right now. Sorry for being so cryptic, - - but things have come up that could affect your safety. The war has entered a new phase. Reichskommissar Josef Terboven's brutal regime - - was exposed two months ago. He imposed martial law - - and personally oversaw the mass execution of 72 men. The persecution of Jews has also increased. The Norwegian police have arrested all Jewish men - - over the age of 15, and confiscated ... Hello? Mrs. Wigert? How is your little dog? Perhaps it needs to go for a walk? Yes, it could use some fresh air. Wonderful! Why don't we meet - - in Haga Park? Mhm. Great! See you there. Mrs. Wigert? Baron von Gossler? Lovely to see you. And where is your little dog today? I look very much forward to - - working together with you on this. It is a great honor for me - - to play this game with the best there is. What do you need me for? To see the big picture in small things. And the places you frequent - - are full of small, - - almost imperceptible things. Which may not be so insignificant after all. Don't I need to know which "imperceptible" things to look for? What do you think of an Allied invasion? Here, in Sweden. An Allied invasion? That would be something! What do you think? You must know something, - - if you're a spy. Are you? It was lovely to see you, Baron von Gossler. I'm sure we'll run into each other again. But now I have matters to attend to. We have reason to believe that someone in our ranks - - isn't completely loyal. Leaking information we'd rather not share. To the Allies. Infiltrate our ranks. Find the leak. I'll do my best to observe - - with the connections I have. But there aren't many. Why not use your Hungarian lover? Don't worry, Mrs. Wigert. I won't tell the Reichskommissar about him. Terboven has some skeletons of his own in the closet. But it still wouldn't end well if he found out. The Hungarian will remain between us. Until next time, Mrs. Wigert. Come on! Come, Eva. I need a real leak this time. Not just gossip. Are you watching me? Tapping my phone? You are, aren't you? You need to stop immediately. The slightest suspicion that we're cooperating, - - and they will kill my family. Understand? And I can read this in any newspaper. I need names. Would you want me to give you up to someone? I'll see what I can do. I may have some assets to spare. Your contact with von Gossler might lead us to "Maria". I want my family brought here. Not yet. Like you say, we have to be careful. Such a step might look suspicious. There are men outside my door! Help us nab "Maria", and I'll get your family to safety. You have my word. Good. Andor Gellert. What is his relationship to the Germans? He regularly leaves Stockholm. Do you know where he goes? Where would he go? That's what we want to find out. No way! -I know him. -Do you? How well? If he keeps his travels secret, what else? I want you to get more information on him. This is one of our spies. We found her under a bridge. Drowned. Her brother ratted her out. Close relations are no guarantee. Patrik? Patrik? -Can we talk? -Not now. -I have a question. -Now is not a good time. That! What is that? My god! This. What is this? What is this? Just a job. Nature photographs. For whom? The Germans? Are you crazy? The Germans? Please! Shit! It's just some pictures. Who pays you? I don't know. I've never met them. It was a few days after we met at Berns. That's when I got the first letter. They would double the money once I delivered the pictures. I just took some pictures of the coastline, some harbors. It's OK. Who do you deliver them to? I put them in a garbage bin in Haga Park. -So you've seen them? -No. I don't know who he, or they, are. I may have seen someone once, - - but it could have been anyone. Are you going to deliver those? When? This afternoon. At four o'clock. What do you want them for? This is a really bad idea. What the hell? Sonja! Trust me. -What's this about? -You're late. "Maria" is picking this up at four o'clock in Haga Park. -And my family? -You can't ... -Fine. Have a nice war. -We've talked about this. Of course I'll bring your family to Sweden. Give it to me. It isn't a name, - - but if this leads us to "Maria" ... Your mission will be over. And I'll bring your family to safety. What more can I say? I promise? I swear? -Where did you get these pictures? -From a friend. Drop them in the garbage bin by the Gustav III pavilion. And how did you get hold of these pictures? Just make sure you catch him. Five o'clock at Café Blom. -No one came? -That's why I'm here. Shit, someone must have seen me! Patrik! Sonja? Sonja, wait! Stop here! Sonja ... Patrik? Patrik? Oh my god! Patrik? Patrik? Patrik! Sonja. We can't stay here. Let's go. We are quite sure. His name is Andor Gellert. Hungarian diplomat. She found the photo evidence in his possession. These are from the dead photographer. She found the same type of pictures at his place. -I need more. -Major, with all due respect ... I have no need for your respect. Just do what you get paid for. And catch him alive. He got away. But we'll catch him. Now the Germans know I work for you. -Calm down. -Sure. Easy for you to say. What am I supposed to do? My family and I are as good as dead. I'm telling you, we'll catch him. Put me through to Akrell. I spoke to von Gossler. I told him I know who the leak is. No, I don't actually know. And that I would only reveal it to "Maria". Face to face. Tomorrow, Café Bellmansro, at noon. Akrell, send the whole damn police force, if necessary. -You have something for us? -Not here and not now. What can be said tomorrow that can't be said now? This location is terrific. No one is listening. You haven't been in contact with Swedish intelligence, have you? Of course they've been in touch with me. They asked me about everything and everyone. They are not idiots. Good night. We're not quite done here, Mrs. Wigert. Whatever happened to your young Hungarian lover? I don't know. Shoot me. I'll bring what I know to my grave. And you can expect a showdown with Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. Tidholm, the car. Mrs. Wigert! "Maria". Herr Finke? Mrs. Wigert! Come, come. A true pleasure. As always. Allow me to get straight to the point. We have for a time suspected - - that your young, handsome Hungarian is our leak. He has had virtually - - unlimited access to our embassy. And now he has gone into hiding. At your love nest. I suggest you show us the way. Mrs. Wigert? I don't see a boat. There's no one here. Dr. Finke! These are our photographs. He's copied all of them. Damned traitor! Come on! Find him! Maybe he hid the boat. Where? There. Wait. Agent Bill identified "Maria" as Albert Finke. The German Director of Tourism. He and Baron von Gossler had committed extensive espionage - - along our coast. They were arrested at the German legation while destroying evidence. I kept my promise, and with some effort - - managed to smuggle her family across the border - - to their summer residence in Falkenberg. Did Bill's efforts change the outcome of the war? Perhaps not. But her liaisons with the Germans caused irreparable damage - - to her career. It isn't easy to shake off suspicion. Even harder if you're a double agent. RETURN TO SENDER He's probably gone underground. No addresses. No known relatives. Nothing. If he worked for the Americans, he may have gone to England. Or the United States. I'm sorry. "For Service to King and Country"? That's right. You made a heroic effort for our nation and our freedom. Unfortunately, for the foreseeable future, no one will know. So don't expect any applause. That doesn't exist in our line of work. Akrell? If you ever find out where he is - - could you give him this? Sonja ... Keep it. I promise to do everything in my power to find out where he is. Thank you. Sonja met Andor once later, when he was married. She never spoke of her wartime activities, - - but worked for the CIA from 1942 to 1945. She died in 1980. The information on her wartime efforts wasn't released until 2005.
