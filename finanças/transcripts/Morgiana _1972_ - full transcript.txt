Besides a rent for life, I leave to my elder daughter, Viktoria, my country estate and the hunting lodge called Green Flute, with the grounds and furnishings, and all jewels and valuables kept in the safe at the lodge, as specified in the list attached. The rest of my property I leave to my younger daughter Klára - the building lots, shares, bank accounts, the villa and gardens. Aren't you tired of looking at yourself? Or are you looking for a bridegroom? You don't have to worry about the future. You'll have many suitors. - Glenar the lawyer, for one. - Why are you making fun of me, Viki? I love you, Klára. Your inexperience, your naive good heart... You are my sister, after all. But your face annoys me. Viki, please try to get over this feeling you have. You'll feel happier. - What do you know? - We are different. But I don't want you to suffer when I don't. I am glad that you think that way. Viki, just try to love me as I love you, simply and sincerely. - We are sisters, aren't we? - Let's forget it. All this talking leads nowhere. I want to know if you are coming to the Green Flute, now that the house is going to be repaired. No. - You won't? - I won't. I don't feel at ease at your Green Flute. Well, then I wish you good night. The spring has been bubbling like champagne all week. Are you drinking before breakfast? Water will only give you stomach pain. - Have the masons come? - Yes, they're unloading their tools. I will talk to the foreman in a few minutes. They are to start in our rooms. We have to move out. It is such a lovely day, Viki. Let's not bother with moving furniture. Let them build the scaffolding outside and we will have visitors in the afternoon. As you wish. It is your house, your money. I simply wanted to help you. You are kind. Morgana... Come, get him. - Are you going to the country too? - I'm staying here. - Klára gets scared there. - Nonsense, Viki. Yes, she is afraid of the dead dancer. The ballerina who used to own the lodge? - Is her ghost walking about? - Klára thinks so. Don't you, Klára? Viki exaggerates. How cruel to die so young and lovely. And rich. That didn't help her either and her lover soon followed her to the grave. That's true love. Or a guilty conscience. He was jealous of her dancing. He provided her with luxury but wanted to have her for himself. He bribed the doctors. He told her she was dangerously ill. She was not supposed to dance. Her feet would be crippled. - Isn't that so, Klára? - The caretaker once saw her through the window, dancing in front of the mirror, crying. In the end she was very ill. I would like to talk to you, Klára. So would I. Please pay some attention to my sister. That would please me. This may not be the loveliest rose but it's the one I like best. Do your swans always ignore your guests? Wake up, sleepyheads. I hope you didn't spoil your shoes. They are nice. - Are they? - Yes. Don't you agree, ladies? Klára, I have to talk to you about an important matter. - What happened? - Nothing, really. I wanted to write to you but didn't have the courage. And now... Maybe I'd better... write to you. Shall I bring a pencil and paper? Or would you rather tell me? - I wanted to be with you. - We've been together all afternoon. - But not alone. - Why aren't you with Viki? I asked you to keep her company. I want to be with you. You could at least have talked to her. I don't like her. I hope you don't mind. - Aren't you sorry for her? - I love you. Now you've told me, you must feel better. Stay with my sister while I change. And think of a good excuse for why you left her. A letter, a strange woman, difficulties, death... Great wealth. I see money and jewels. All in connection with the black queen. That's you. Money and wealth - quite close to you. The queen of hearts stands in your way. She's ahead of you everywhere - an obstacle in your path, the queen of hearts... Continue. A suitor... interested in you... A knight in uniform - it may be love... But that concerns the queen of hearts. - The obstacles in my path? - Yes, it's up to you to remove what stands between you and wealth. I also see a journey... and misfortune. That will do. Don't lick that. You won't feel anything anyway. You'll only go to sleep, to sleep forever... And no one would know why. Do you hear? Our rose... Pretty. But cut flowers smell better. You are going to love her. We will remember her lovingly. I want the masons to start on this side, from my room. Yes. I'll tell them. I'm leaving so I won't get in their way. - I thought you were awake. - Have breakfast with me, Viki. Thank you, I've already eaten. Call the upholsterer, Klára. He's been promising the wallpaper samples for a week now. I'll call him now... Why don't you call him? I would only quarrel with him. I see. Number 38, please. Yes, I'll wait. I'll call later. There is no answer. Wait a moment. What did the upholsterer say? It was the wrong number. I'll call again later. It was bubbling a minute ago and now it looks like dead water. Dead water - that sounds like a fairytale. You left it standing too long. Drink your cocoa and ring for a fresh glass. I am hungry. Another chicken gone. How funny... What's so funny? It may not seem funny to you but the egg could have turned into a chicken, the chicken into a hen which could have laid eggs and I am going to eat all those eggs now. You should wash all the eggs down. You'll be happy to see me leave, won't you? - Viki! - Never mind... I hope you'll be happy in your Green Flute. You must come and see us, it isn't far. And I'll come and visit you. You'd better write to me to be sure I am in. Bye. Bye, Viki. A draught, always a draught. Now I know I am at home. See that the windows are always closed. I want you to show me the accounts every week. As you wish, Miss. If I may suggest, we could demolish the shed in the yard and put some flowerbeds there. I told you I don't want any flowers. Don't put any in my room either. Thank you. You may go now. It's all over for us now, unless... they cheated us and sold us ordinary water. Is that the dog my sister found? Yes, see how he's grown. My son loves to play with him. They've brought the new harvester, Miss. I'll come immediately. Sorry, I can't. I really don't feel well. No. I am terribly thirsty. I am sure it will pass. I'll call you. Gerda, another lemonade. Look, Gerda, are the pupils of my eyes dilated? You are imagining things, my dear. But my lips are full of blisters. What's wrong with those oranges? They are the same as ever. I'm so glad you came after all. I only invited a few people. - You're still a bit pale. - Give me a drink, please. What would you like? A lot of water. I don't feel any pain. I feel as if my body had been exchanged for another. You'll rest now Viki is gone and you are alone. Were you frightened? I felt like I was drowning - as if being strangled by the depths. I couldn't help it. I had to look down as if something was pulling me. You could have been dead. I was once almost run over by a train, but instinct made me pull back. I cannot remember why I moved so quickly. I could tell you something about that accident with the hat. Just a moment, please. I have a lot of relatives. This is Marek, a distant cousin. He has been posted to this garrison. Where did you find it? I was riding along the beach. I found it under the rocks. Just like in a novel. What is it, Doctor? Many diseases start with contradictory symptoms. One does not recognise them till later. - We have to wait, then? - Yes. Is there anything you miss? Read a novel or something. And don't forget to take the quinine. Just to make sure. There are various hidden forms of malaria. But how could you be suffering from malaria? Take the quinine anyway. And watch your diet. Who is banging about all the time? Repairs are being done to the house. I've brought the wallpaper samples, Miss. No message from my sister? I haven't seen the young lady. They say she is ill. - Didn't they say what's wrong? - The doctor doesn't know. She drinks a lot of water and is very weak. A drink... a drink... Wait, his dish is empty. Shall I pour your tea? You've forgotten the windows again. Sorry, Miss. It was for the cat. She always comes back in this way. That draught will kill me one day. Take the glass away, Nelly. Bring me a cup. I'll drink my tea from a cup in future. Go and splash yourselves elsewhere. A cervical vertebrate is damaged. The doctor says she won't be able to move her head again. Isn't he thirsty? Take that to the girl. What a nasty trick. What are you doing? He always plays with the dog. He even drinks from his dish. I am thirsty, Mummy. He has a fever. I'll put him to bed. So this is your house? An isolated spot. Don't worry, I am careful. I walked from the bridge. - May I sit down? - Yes. What do you want? Listen. I have come to find out... ...you know what, don't you? - Nothing has happened yet. - Did you receive my package? - Naturally. - That's excellent. Are you waiting for a suitable occasion, then? You assured me you don't interfere in your clients' affairs. I hope that... I know that your sister has been ill for days. Her physician, Dr Mayer, confided in a friend of his... ...that he considers her illness highly peculiar. You have been misinformed. My sister's illness is only a slight indisposition. Your orders were quite precise. You asked for a poison that acts slowly, and for the one who drinks it to die later without a cause that could be established by an autopsy. Those were your words. We made a note of them. You asked for a tasteless, odourless liquid. Isn't that the truth? - I fail to understand. - You will, soon. Your demands were exacting and production was difficult. We had to conduct experiments and go to a lot of expense. The expense was greater than the price paid. You are rich and you'll inherit from your sister. I think we'll come to an arrangement. This is blackmail. Imagine your sister's feelings... ...upon reading a letter with many interesting details. You sold me the poison! I have a witness to testify that you stole the flask from a chest which my husband had shown you, telling you of its effect. Don't you remember, the maid caught you climbing from a chair by the chest? Your calculations won't pay off. That poison wasn't intended for my sister. How funny you are. My own sister... I am listening. All right. I'll give you some money. I'll go to the bank in town and will give it to your husband. Leave him out of it. He's a scientist and above such things. You'll pay me. How much? I'll give you 5,000. That will buy you a ticket to prison. Get out. Did you think you'd grab the money and disappear? Or did you intend to buy a husband blinded by gold... ...so that he can't see you? How repulsive you are! Why should you try to save money at my expense? I can go and tell your sister how to get well. You see? That would be the end of your plans! Come back! Tell Gerda to bring me some writing paper. Do you have to write? You have to rest. I want to write to my sister. I hoped I'd feel better. Some Lieutenant. I didn't catch the name. Oh, I don't feel well at all. I'm probably suffering from TB or cancer, leukaemia, hallucinations... ...at least according to my medical literature. Yes. I'll be looking forward to it. Don't worry. Your sister has been poisoned and is going to die. - Though I could still cure her. - The doctor could cure her too, then. No, he doesn't know the poison. He can't give an antidote. How much then? 500,000? The stones seem to be genuine. Some are quite pretty, but most are of poor quality. The pearls are made of glass. Is there anything else? Yes, but you will only get what's on the table. I never touched the flask, I can show it to you. - Do you want to haggle? - I'll show you the flask. Show it to me, my dear. I'll prove that it now contains only what you put in it instead of the poison. You'd have to open the package. - What do you mean? - I haven't opened it. I may be stupid. I was afraid of your package. I was sure everyone knew about it. I must have hidden it in a dozen places, getting up every night to make sure it was still there. Then I buried it... ...among the rocks, over the ravine. Show me the package. I am willing to take it back. - Why? You can take my word for it. - I won't. - Thanks for the money. - Don't mention it. Get well soon. Wait. Do you think I have been lying to you? You may have forgotten the place. It isn't far now. I am not going any further. Wait. It isn't far... Here we are. It was easy to topple the stone. Help me to lift it. Try More... It won't move. Let me try. I can't. Are you up again? You know you shouldn't. Don't tell the doctor I went to the garden for five minutes. Don't upset me. You know it harms me. I'll be back soon. I feel much better already. I'll tell the doctor anyway. What's your name? I know, you're Klára. I am ill. The doctor doesn't know what's wrong. We are very much alike. Do you want to be my sister? Give me your hand. I have no one... please. Klára, what's the matter? Let go, please. You've driven her away. I want to help you! You know I love you. No. Leave me alone. If this happens again, I'll report your negligence. It is my fault. Permit me to judge who is at fault. Why is there so much noise? Send the masons away! The patient must have quiet. The pulse is weak but regular. What do you think? - I don't know. - What? People call them hallucinations. Hallucinations. You don't smoke hashish do you? Something has agitated your nervous system. That's why lights, sounds and colours disturb you. Let me see. Your inner organs are all right, except for the liver, maybe. I can't be sure, though. If there is no change for the better or for worse, I am going to call a consilium. Don't be afraid. We have many mysterious cases. Don't we, Nurse? Stay in bed. That can do no harm. I'll be back tomorrow. Doctor, swear I am not going to die. Fear won't help you. Do what the nurse tells you. - I hope your boy isn't ill. - No, he is all right. Running around with the dog as usual. May I come in? Viki, I am glad you are here. Meet Lieutenant Marek, Eva Horn's cousin. We met at my cousin's. What does the doctor say? I don't think he knows what it is. And how are you in your hermitage, Viki? It's very quiet. If you had changed immediately after your adventure with the swans... Do you think I caught a cold? Many diseases are as yet unknown to the medical profession. May I? Do you have a fever? No, I only imagine things - like dreams, only I am awake... Dr Mayer wants to call a consilium. Lieutenant Marek wants to be a pilot. Just imagine. Airplanes tend to crash and pilots get killed. Pilots die young. It may not be a bad thing to die young. Thank you. I do not want to die. I am willing to get old. Help yourself, Lieutenant! What's wrong with you, Viki? Me? What's wrong with you? I don't really know... I must be bad. I have evil thoughts... I'll tell you everything once I'm well. Of course. Don't excite yourself. How lovely. Is there an empty vase? Miss Klára gets lots of flowers. We could get rid of those Mr Glenar sent. You seem exhausted. I'll take the Lieutenant to the door. Come, Lieutenant... Your presence seems to make her happy. What do you think of her? She has changed, but I am convinced she will get well. So you are optimistic in spite of her illness. You love her, don't you? What does that have to do with her illness? Nothing, of course. But I think you would be happy to overcome obstacles, for the sake of love. If there was a rival, would you fight a duel? Or would you rather save his life? Klára could then be grateful to you and you'd suffer with a smile. Is it true, Marek? May I call you Marek? You've guessed the truth. Viktorie, where did you find her? Gerda brought it from the attic. - Wasn't your Klára there too? - Yes, torn apart and without eyes. - I have to tell you something. - No, listen to me first. You must forgive me. I shouldn't have thought such horrible things. But now, with Father gone, I have no one but you. As soon as I get well I am going to get married. Marek hasn't said anything yet but I know he loves me and I love him. You won't want me around then. Don't say that. You'll stay with me, with us. We won't let you leave. Both of us will love you. Yes, yes... But you wanted to say something and I didn't give you a chance. Never mind, it wasn't anything of importance. Just a kind of feeling. It's a long time since we talked so openly. I feel much better already. I love you, Viki. This is no bluff. This is provocation. To win on such a bad hand... This is the last time I let you take my place. Yesterday you promised never to gamble again. Let's play for all we have, gentlemen. - I'll deal... - Are you mad? That's all I have. Gentlemen, I am paying today. You were given a poison that kills within four weeks. There is no immediate danger. H! make a deal with you. Only! know the antidote. I will give it to you when we agree on the price of your fife. "The price of your life..." - Where are you going, so late? - Why are you spying on me? What do you want? Did you write that letter? The letter? I did write it to you. - I wrote several times, but... - Go away. Leave me alone. Listen to me. You are ill. I want to help you. I detest you. Blackmailer. Let go. She hasn't eaten since you went to town. And she's been like this since last night. Take her away. That's the end. No, gentlemen, only our table. Really, gentlemen, only our table. See? They aren't asleep yet. Naturally, they are always ready for customers. And if they had been sleeping, they wouldn't have to get up! Ladies! Here you are! Come, I'll show you something. Come. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Just that... So you don't like me? No, no, you are nice. I simply don't feel like it. You like them younger, don't you? The fun seems to be over. You spoil everything. Don't make her angry. She'll take it out on us. Come here. Go to hell. I already told you he isn't here. I've seen that his coach is waiting. Tell him I have to speak to him about Klára! Go! Why did you bring him? Go away. Leave, will you? You are mad. And you are drunk again. Send him away! Why did you bring him? Get him out of here or I'll cut his throat. What are you staring at? Go. Someone is waiting for you outside. He is going to kill you because of a girl called Klára. If he kills you, I won't have to. You must have stolen his girl. You'll have to pay for his Klára. The villain. I understand Klára told me about you. You don't have to explain. - That simplifies matters. - I'm at your service. My friends are inside. I can call them in a second. - Choose the weapons. - Nonsense. Sir. Don't be foolish, I have not come to fight you. If you don't want to fight, we can still hit you. - Wait! - Listen. Klára left the house tonight. You know how ill she is. She came to the casino, then disappeared. Someone saw her in the street getting into a coach. She must have gone to see her sister at the Green Flute. She kept talking of a letter. I thought you should know. Thank you. - Are you leaving us behind? - Wait. You came with us, gambled with us. You'll leave with us. This letter was written by a fool and you fell for it. Give me the letter, Viki. You shouldn't have. Why did you poison me? Do you really consider me a monster? Only this afternoon you said you loved me. Viktorie, I beg you, tell me the truth. I want to know the truth. I know nothing about this. - Don't pester me. - All right. I'm going to ask the person who wrote to me to come forward. - I will pay whatever they ask. - You are mad. I want to know how my sister killed me. Shut up! I don't want to hear any more! You're ill, do you understand? You're right, but I want to know why you wanted to kill me. Tell me the truth. I want the truth. If you insist... I bought a potion from someone... It was a special potion that inspires dreams... Are you tired? I'll be brief. Where was I? Ah, yes. I gave you a few drops secretly. You bought the stuff for yourself and gave it to me? - I wanted to observe the effect. - On me...? Why not? You love to talk of your dreams. I didn't know it could harm you. I wanted it to be enjoyable for you. I wanted to hear you talk of dreams you'd never dreamt. Now I see that I am the victim of blackmailers. They sold me a poison and now they are blackmailing me. But they couldn't have known you would give me the potion? You are right. I no longer know. It happened the day you came and asked me to call the upholsterer. How can one dream in the daytime? You are cheating me, Viktorie. I don't believe you. Why did you destroy me? Don't excite yourself, Klára. I gave you the drops as I was told to. Why did you leave once you'd put the poison in my glass? You ought to lie down. Who sold you the poison? I do not want to you to get worse. Go to bed. Don't drink! It's against the doctor's orders. Obey me. Go to bed, now. Not a word... We're alone here. Admit that you killed me. You have no proof, no one will believe you. You are mad because you are ill. One kills wounded birds out of mercy. I told you, Klára isn't at the Green Flute. Go back to town. She must be waiting for you at home. We are going to call there and you are coming with us! - Don't you believe me...? - That remains to be seen. - This journey is quite unnecessary. - Do you think so? Klára is probably waiting in town. She needs help. What do you want to do there? - It's almost dawn. - Please... If Klára had come here in the meantime, she'd be in the drawing room. Follow the... This is the only room where the lights are on. I forgot to put them out. Do you still think I am lying? Forgive me, I meant well. - Will you return to town with us? - No. - But isn't this Klára's hat? - The servants never tidy up. She must be here. Come, Klára, it's time to stop playing games. It's a good thing you've locked the room. No one will disturb us. Yes, I am here, alive and well. You don't suffer from hallucinations like your sister. You are a common murderer! But you can't kill me. Fortunately, I am a good swimmer. We'll double the price now, and you know why. - 500,000 and all the jewels. - Never. Do you hear? Never. - I'd rather die than pay. - Shout as much you like. I don't mind a scandal. Your sister doesn't know her murderer yet. But we shouldn't keep her in the dark too long. Tomorrow, she and her friends will learn that you poisoned her. Till tomorrow. I'll appear at noon. Two attempts at murder will finish you. I must have lost my way... We all do, sometimes. Someone must always show us the way... ...and you've found someone who will show you the most pleasant way... - Give me a drink, please. - Have a drink, dear. That often helps, before... I asked for water. They say water is harmful. People drink a lot of water anyway. - Have some more! - No! I am ill. This is just like a drug, Believe me, I'm an experienced man. I am going to die. I've been poisoned, you know? Another reason to have a drink. I am not in the habit of drinking. It was high time, then. Where are you going? Wait, dear, wait. My sister poisoned me, you know? She must be a nice sister. Come here. Don't be afraid, I won't poison you. You haven't seen a young girl, have you? We must go on. We'll search the woods. She is dead. Klára had time to tell me everything. If you weren't a woman I'd kill you. I'll give evidence in court. If you're lucky they'll declare you insane. That's the only place that can save you, the lunatic asylum. If you were a soldier, I'd leave you my pistol. But you are obviously a coward. Get out. Pick up my pearls. I've torn the string. - Where have you buried my cat? - I don't know. The caretaker may have thrown her on the dust heap. I am sorry. Miss Trangen died last night. That's impossible. This poison doesn't kill. We know that now. The patient is on the road to recovery. The elder sister Viktorie died. Who is calling, please? - Madam... - Excuse me. A Cognac. - Two. - Three. - May l...? - The crisis has passed. That thirst of yours must have been your body fighting the poison. What kind of poison was it? That's hard to determine. It caused hallucinations. There are many poisonous plants - mushrooms, insects, deadly poisons. Even humans have poisonous substances in their saliva. They are transmitted easily. - By kissing? - This is a serious matter, young man. You won't be needing me any more. A chemist who is an expert on poisons and has no moral inhibitions... Is it possible that alcohol could act as an antidote? It didn't, of course not. The poison wasn't deadly. Its effects were only temporary. The alcohol just helped speed up the reaction and recovery. See? Did you say anything, Doctor?
