What? Suzy said you that you left with Beatrice Covington ... Suzy lied? - Suzy lied? Mom! Oh, you did leave. See? Then why did he say he was -- - Why did you say that you were in a meeting in your office ... no, I’m not giving you the third degree. It’s not what I think? What do you think I think, that you’re shacked up at some hotel with that model? No, I didn’t have you followed. I was kidding. Oh no. No. No. Of course it’s cheating. You bastard – He tried to say it wasn’t cheating because we weren’t married yet. How could he do this to me? I thought he loved me. Sherri ... Oh, God. Not now. It’s The Four Seasons banquet manager.

Then what do you want then? I’m on a break. I’m the cook at my dad’s restaurant Oh, you're a chef? - Cook. You are? I’m such a foodie. What kind of chef/cook are you? I used to make Italian food, but that's all about to change... a new concept. Every night a different menu. Mondays - Indian. Tuesdays - Japanese. Wednesday – God knows. Thursday – who cares. That sounds weird. Desperate measures for desperate times. Business sucks lately. Sucks, like it might close? It’s not good. That’s too bad. I was all set to give it a try. I just got dumped. I'm sorry. Correction. I dumped Brandon because he… Cheated. Who told you? - You did. "Asshole cheating --" Oh... Can I get you something? Ativan, valium, xanax... I’m not fussy. Sorry.

Right after I got my MBA, out of the blue my dad decided he wants to go move to Virgin Gorda and live on a boat... without us. Oh no … that’s really sad Yea it was. Especially for my mother. Not just his leaving, but he decided to take whatever money they had in the bank with him and leaving her to manage their real estate holdings on her own. Did she even know how? Not at first. She was in way over her heard. So she begged for me to come home and help her out. So, here I am six years later. I get it. Sherri, I applied for a job as sous-chef at Felidia. I should be hearing from her any day now. Harry! That is so, so brave. It is, isn't it? The timing's not great but I need proper training if I’m gonna be a four star Italian chef. A four star chef.

Well, wikipedia isn’t always right... Hey! You were going to show me a picture of your mom. Oh... She’s so pretty... And so young. She was only eighteen when she had me. I don’t even remember her. I was just a baby when she left. You mean she just took off? Well, she was just a kid herself. Harry, that’s terrible, not to have a mom, or even remember her ...

Sherri, I told you Lidia’s my escape plan. What’s yours? You mean, now that I’m not marrying ‘asshole”-- ‘cheating ex-fiance’ - I’m not sure ... I’m good at what I do but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life collecting rents ... I want something I can really dig my teeth into … back into my marketing skills ... come up with some app .. Or some product that people can’t really live without. Like the George Foreman grill. Oh, I can live without the George Foreman grill. Okay, well, how about q-tips. - Oh. Zippers. That’s it.

No. No. Sherri, can I say something really truly personal? That sounds scary. Your fiancé was an idiot. Having an affair with an actress – Model. When he had someone like you. You’re smart. Sexy. Funny. Warm. Stop. And me. I’m not exactly the cool kind of guy you’ve been dating. Poor Harry. You’re not that uncool. I mean, uncool can actually be pretty hot. A kind of ... sweet ... hot.

Twenty-four hours ago she was engaged to someone else. To someone else? - Yes. She was engaged ... to another man. She’s vulnerable, and totally reactive. L’amore ... it’s a powerful force. Do you even know him? I knew Brandon and look where that got me. This time i’m trusting my gut. Harry’s different. I'll say. Look, I’m not asking your permission.

You totally blindsided me. Sherri I can’t do this. I can’t. Are you breaking it off? Not sure it’s “breaking it off” after one night. Breaking it off seems a little too, too .. Official. We were engaged. - That was your idea. Don’t you dare pin all this on me. - You -- Sure, I proposed, but I don’t remember holding a gun at your head. - You... and you mom, and now my Dad.

I'm delighted to offer you the position as a sous–chef at Felidia. Please report to work with your knives a week from Monday at 6 a.m. Ciao. Little Harry, Little Harry. Get out here. Get out here. You’re never gonna believe this. Some guy calls, says he’s a location scout for a movie, can they use Cudicini’s as a location. Dad, I gotta tell you something - - You won't believe what they're offering $30,000 for three days. That’s great, Dad. But listen – - $30,000 I can pay off my back rent. I’ll even have enough left over to market the hell out of my newest plan. Your newest plan? Not just international, but a vaygan international cuisine. Vegan? - Vaygan. You mean vegan. And gluten free and - Yeah. You know what I mean. It’s what everyone wants nowadays, and it’ll be cheaper to run without meat. Slap me five, kid. Slap me five. I have a meeting with the tofu wholesaler on Canal Street. Oh, and that’s not all. I’m gonna put Sherri to work starting a business with Noninna’s Biscotti. Dad. Dad. Stop... the engagement is off. What? Why? What happened? It was all happening too fast -- Aw. Jeez. Well ... it was pretty insane. Sherri’s a doll, but getting engaged on the first date was the kind of impulsive thing I’d be more likely to do than you, eh. Like father, like son? But the idea’s still good. You can be in charge of Noninna’s Biscotti. Do it any way you want, I’ll stay out of it. Dad, Lidia called this morning and offered me the job ... Me. Lidia chose me. Ah, no. Oh Hell, maybe it’s time you find out what the real world is like ... Get kicked around a little like everybody else ... It’s been too easy. Yeah, it’ll be a good lesson. And maybe you’ll appreciate your ole man more. Dad, I do appreciate you. I’m going to make you proud. Basta, Little Harry. Basta.

I was worried sick. You came home and slammed the door and you wouldn’t let me in. The engagement is - Off. I figured that out. Please tell me it wasn’t all my fault. No ... There’s blame enough to go around… I know I can be a bit … pushy. You think? So, here’s the deal, Mom. I’m moving out. It’s time for me to be on my own. Okay. And I’m giving notice. I need to find my own thing. Okay. And Mom, I’ll have children if and when I’m ready. Okay. Okay. What are you doing out here, anyhow? I’m bringing the dress back to Zoya’s and the cameo Harry’s dad gave me. I’ll return the dress, you return the cameo. Okay. Hey. Sorry to barge in. I was looking for your dad. He’s out stocking up on tofu – soft, dried, fermented, pickled - I came to bring him back Nonnina’s pin. Please... don’t forget to give him back his pin. Don’t just stuff it in some drawer, it’s - I got it ... I will. Tell him I’m sorry I never got my Italian lessons. - I will. And tell him ... ciao. Ciao. Sherri ... I’m sorry I was so unkind. You were, Harry. You really were. - I know. I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I panicked. I know that’s no excuse. No, it’s not. What about “Kaboom?” “Kaboom?” I didn’t just imagine it... it wasn’t just me. - No. You didn’t. Well… What's your favorite color?
