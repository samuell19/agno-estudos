Horror Story In loving memory of Marie Vachal. I can see where she lives in the cemetery. She left me so she wouldn't disturb me in my work. And my next wife's capital would help me achieve my plans. Masa gave her life for art and the realisation of my dreams. I was to fashion intricate fates, human and imaginary. The seat of Prince Pedro de Rudibanera in Barcelona. Where are you, dear daughter? The worms eat away your body! The daughter disappeared mysteriously ten years before. Brother...I am here again! Kurt, the prince's second-born, returns from years in exile.

Has your last delivery been exhausted, father Bruna? Agata is to be placed in a tub of spirits so that she may be preserved and proclaimed a saint next year. Thus the monastery will be much enriched by the congregation. The institute hid from prying eyes Kuba's secret hide-away. Kuba cured corpses and gave them to the monastery of St. Sucipicus where Bruna made a good soup from them. The soup for the poor was excellent, plentiful and cheap. The freshest morsel was to hang here for the reverend father. Hanicka, it is a pity to meet like this again! The young game-keeper Rolf also secretly loved Hanicka. The honourable informant Rolf hurries to the gendarme post. The police commissioner takes away a fettered rascal. I'm innocent! Who was that? Gendarme, the chain!

Ignatius is confessor to the prince and his lover, lying here on the floor. Behold the poor wretch who wanted to murder our prince! Klementina, what have you done? She did not answer, for her name was Elzevira. The prince was confused, she could not reply. Wall her up! Forgive me, leave me to die! I can't go on! Wall her up in the cellar! A wise decision. No! No! She wanted to murder you! It is easy to turn the wheel of fate of one impure. With penance, fasting and prayer. Elzevira was shown the better path. Take that away. Off you run! Since she was pious and did not yield to Bruna's temptations there were many surprises for her. Do not fear, I will protect you from now on, Dear daughter, where are you? - Beloved Marie, where are you? Seeing the confused prince, Ignatius hatched a devilish plot. Here I am, dear father!

The bird was missing on the counterfeiter's banknotes. Kalina toasted to the memory of his dead daughter. They were together forever. To Hanicka! Now they are my enemies and your seducers. Human iniquity has swept me from great heights to this degraded madhouse. Let the wretches shiver! Victory will be ours! And you'll be mine, won't you? She was certain that she was with child. In her swoon she had been seduced by his passion. Elzevira knew that with the valorous help of her saviour, she would get out of this terrible place and become his wife.

The crew and cargo will soon be slicing through the waves. The captain is called Don Rodriguez Pirates! Stop! Pirates! Start blowing! Pirates on the horizon! Didn't you hear me? Everyone blow! Bring out the monks! Rodriguez was the only one who knew where the treasure was. The Jesuit had ordered Bruno to spy on Ignatius. Neither of the villains betrayed their vile plot. Pirates! Help me! Bring the cauldron! Indulging in the grog had astounding results. Especially when two spoonfuls of rum were added along with a hard-worked nail. Long live Rodriguez! Come on, boys! Dr. Rimsa, founder of societies against alcohol and baldness aided by spiritism and morality. All leaned towards the doctor to convince him that they had not drunk any alcohol. His curative methods had a terrible influence on them. The Master was a propagator of disobedience to order. He encouraged free-thinking and did as he pleased. He had worked his way through many societies like this. He who found himself enveloped by the intoxicating and fragrant potion had to have it at all costs. The cauldron, full of the liquid delicacy, had the value of gold on the oceanic black markets Thus it was the most desired body of the pirates. Kuba seized hold of a man in his flight from the attic. Both men hurtled to the cellar of the grand house where the notary stored the corpses of his rich clients. Kuba, in his infatuation, thought this lovely place was his home in the Pathological Institute. Kuba recalls the man who dealt him a blow to the head. Kurt, who'd cut off Elzavira's fingers and fled his brother's house, was not stuck in the lime and he told Kuba that he had the documents which proved that he was the true second-born and Rudibanera's heir. Not knowing the rascal he has before him, he tells all. Blood is nothing rare in a horror story and when a steal dagger pierces someone's heart, he leaves this world with a curse, not a moan.

To capture the murderers of his grand-daughter and her love. He did not know Hanicka and Trason were of this world.

In present-day literature girls don't have. cause or opportunity to undertake such reckless tests. They will be happy with any fool if he has status. Yes, they will be happy with any fool if he has status.

What're you going to do with that sheet where you printed that line with ''castle'' twice? You'll see how hell is of service to me. Each mistake I make can only be to my advantage. I did forget about that line in the binding and printed it again by mistake, but no matter. I'll leave the first proof as it is and to the second I'll add some water-colour flames. whipping from the castle windows... ...in the next chapter I'll have it burned down by freemasons or the Jesuits...

I was here beneath her that first time! I've got a family tree! Someone always has to spoil it! Ave Maria... Do you love me? Well? Promise to take me away from this brothel. Now I can entrust you with everything. I was educated...not so fast dear Fragonard! My grandfather saw I was big enough to work, saying ''beneath the candle is the greatest darkness.'' He sent me to work in a wine-bar. I assure you that I never gave myself to anyone. No one has been as nice as you. You can believe in me. I'm clean and sensitive. Not a tramp like the whores in this establishment. Get to work! Now I'm giving the lesson! You can even exercise the spirit with spirits! This is not exercise of the limbs. You stretch out your will, stretch your emotions sideways, you twist your judgement, shake out your memory. extend your imagination and bend your morals! Everyone thought this was a materialised spirit or a case of delirium tremens. But this was Dr. Rimsa's secretary masquerading as a member of the Salvation Army advocating teetotalism. Dr. Rimsa would not be coming anymore, there was no need. The lovers indulged in frequent merry-making. Help! Help! Distant cries reached the new-found Christian love of the Honolulu natives.

Sea animals? Sorry, I didn't mean to... Welcome to my shooting ground. I'm Paseka. Well, next time, then. Josef Vachal- Graphic Artist You wretch! What have you done? Don't you know what havoc your novel's caused? You'll be grateful to me one day. I coated your tongue with the poison of intolerance and the scorn of those who hunt in packs. You'd be the outsider like them. Only I freed you from that rabble isolated from the morals and customs of the pack. I showed you other fates of humanity. You saw your former friends forming new slogans and utopia for the sake of morality, with bloodied hands and a bartered soul. What drivel! Murderer of my brilliant occult future! Prepare to die! You mean, one of us A murder belongs in a horror story. The author can't murder himself in his own novel. Kill Fragonard instead, that sentimental wraith! He values the life of a mangy dog above humans. He seeks absolution in the skirts of tramps. Save your breath. I cannot even straighten my back in the company of people like you for whom neither God nor religion is holy enough! Not even yourself! You resisted temptation but the landau in which you travelled stank too strongly. Offers of rides are too dangerous! Come on, Tarzan. Doggie... Friends... Here is the work of one cast. Many tears will fall, many designs will be formed. It is a great portrait of our times with all its worries and joys, soon to be happy, futile struggles. I think I hear the cocks crowing outside. It is time to go to bed.
