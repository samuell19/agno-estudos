You'll love the job, laddie - night watchman in an aquarium. Why would any crook want to steal a fish? Er... The pearl! It's gone! The biggest pearl in captivity! The only one of its kind in the world! It's been stolen! Call the director! We've been robbed! There's a thief in the house! Yes, sir, the shell is empty. The pearl's been stolen! Oh, dear, oh, dear! What a catastrophe! What is this, Alphonse? The old shell game? Now you see it, now you don't? - Or have you been hitting the bottle? - I swear it was gone! - You think it went for a walk, perhaps? - But I tell you, it's true! Now, hold on. Come to think of it, the same happened at another museum two weeks ago. I told you so! The pearl disappeared and then was put back. Oh, we're dealing with a very slippery customer, a real shark. Announcing the arrival of Syldair Flight No. 222, arriving from Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, Lodz and Schnitzbags. Passengers with connecting flights will please check with the airline counter in the main hall. These are golf clubs, get it? You must have heard of golf. You know, hole in one? It's a game. Links, golf ball, mashie niblick. Oh, doesn't anyone here speak English? My handicap is two. We love golfers here. Welcome to Syldavia. - I'll bet they play with square golf balls. - He was only doing his job. They check all incoming bags for dangerous weapons. Dangerous? Since when is golf dangerous? Golf never hurt anybody. - Thundering typhoons! - Argh! - Man overboard! - Argh! - The Thompsons. - Those landlubbers? You're not headed for Professor Calculus's house by chance? - Are you on vacation too? - No, on vacation we are not. It's a secret. We're on a confidential mission. - Mum is the word. - Yes, dumb's the word. - And even that is a... - Shh. Call for passengers Tintin, Snowy and Haddock. Your special-charter air taxi is waiting on the runway. Please check in at Desk 22. Come on. We'll give you a lift in our taxi. - Mr Tintin? - Yes? Your aircraft is ready. It's one of our high-C models. Madame Castafiore uses it regularly. Captain Haddock, come on. We've a long flight ahead of us. That opera singer. You say you have a friend living on Lake Flachijzhaf? That is very odd. It certainly is wild-looking country. It gives me the willies looking at it, by blistering barnacles. Any duck-billed people hater with a place here is up to no good. I don't care if he is playing host to our old pal Professor Calculus. Look, there's the artificial lake. They say they had to move a village from the valley before they flooded it. It's not exactly the spot to build a home. It's no place to live, not even to visit. There's a curse on the lake. What's wrong? Motor failure! We'll have to jump. Bail out! Hit the silk! How about us? Hit the silk, he says! He's got the only parachute. Thanks! What do we do? We forgot to pack a parachute. Hey, come back here, you... Argh! Fasten seat belts! - Niko, look there. - We've got to do something. Ah... hiccups. Hic! We'll have to, hic, scare ourselves. Hit the brakes. - Ah... Thanks, Captain. - Yes, thank you. Oh, there she goes! We're sunk now! Jump! Hurry! Jump! Pull, Gustav! Pull Nouchka! Pull! We're saved! Hurray! By thunderation! Three... - After you, sir. - No, after you. - I wouldn't think of it. - Nor would I. I think that I... Gustav! Gustav! You saved our lives. My name is Tintin. That's Captain Haddock and that's Snowy. My name is Niko and this is my sister Nouchka. That's Gustav. He's a great dog. This is Thompson. - Yes, and that is Thomson. - Delighted. Deluded. Delighted. Without you, we'd never have seen our friend, Professor Calculus. - He lives by the lake in the Villa Sprock. - The Villa Sprock?! Beware that place. The lake has a curse on it. Vulture calling. Come in, Neptune. Operation Sardine Can... failed. Party now headed for rendezvous, Objective Two. It worries me that they're late, Madam Vlek. It's very odd. Yes, it's very odd. Hello, Professor! We're here. Did I hear some whispering out there? Welcome, good travellers. My dear friends. It's a promise, then. We'll see you tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Farewell. Goodbye. Thundering typhoons! What's going on? - Nothing to get excited about. - I'm not excited! Only a simple little experiment of mine. This bar is a mechanically induced three-dimensional illusion. - How did you do that? - Watch closely. It's just a slide, Captain, an optical illusion. - The gorilla doesn't really exist. - That's right. It doesn't really exist. Not yet anyway. Beet soup. Home-made. But why create optical illusions, Professor? It's in the interests of science, Tintin, pure research. Suffering catfish! You don't think I was fooled? Now, take that bottle, for example. Anyone can see it's not there. Well... My real intention is to perfect a system of photocopying in three dimensions, but you must keep this a secret. The machine could fall into the wrong hands. - Into the hands of forgers. - Heaven forbid! But this is not likely while I have the protection of these gentlemen. Are those two what you call protection? What a laugh! Who are these forgers you mention? All over the world, works of art are being stolen and the genuine work replaced by forgeries. Yes. What they do is replace the original with a replacement. At first, these were only crude copies, but in the past six months, it has taken experts to tell the real from the fake. - Or the fake from the real. - And vice versa. - And conversely. - That is versa vice. That's right. It is disastrous. We are being flooded by worthless copies. I would go so far as to say we are being flooded by fake fakes. Anyway, Professor, let's not let it spoil the vacation. Here's to you. Well, after all, there's no point in needless worry. Go to sleep and forget it. Good night. Blistering barnacles! Oh, my sea legs! Boy, are you ever nervous, Snowy! Those were bird calls. Great Shark. Agent Ramses calling Great Shark. Foreigners safe and sound in spite of all efforts. I have been informed, Agent Ramses. Initiate Operation Crab tomorrow. Proceed according to plan. Ah... Smell that fresh air! Breathe it in, Snowy. Yoo-hoo! Tintin! We've brought you some goat cheese for your breakfast as we promised. - You'll love it. - It sure smells good. I'll be right down. You didn't happen to see my notes, did you, Captain? - I'm sure I left them here last night. - Your notes? No. It's amazing how absent-minded I am lately. Speaking of notes, Professor, it sounds like one of those modern symphonies in here. - You can't hear yourself think. - What's that? Can't hear yourself think in here. Of course you can't hear a stink. I have a surprise for you. You are just about to witness a scientific miracle. It's Einsteinian, I think, Newtonian. But first, I'll make my chocolate. I'm forever blowing bubbles. Now let it simmer a little. Now, we'll just add two tiny grams of hyposulphobenzene. I mean hypyxopotassium. A pinch is all. That does it. Oh, dear, oh, dear. My goodness, I almost forgot the sugar. There. You'll observe the reactions which will be induced by the action of the reacting compounds which are interacting secondarily with the primary elements. Keep your eye on the blue solution. Here we go. Good heavens! The chocolate exploded. I wonder what I did wrong. Well, it doesn't matter really. Let's get on with the experiment. - I'd say it looks like soap. - I should say, "Let's hope." This product permits one to create perfect three-dimensional copies of any material object. It's dynamite. I don't have to tell you what this means. Imagine what a crook would give to lay hands on such a product. It sure is deserted. Yes, it is. Nobody every comes here. Keep your eye on the ball, if you can. A three... You're not going to believe your eyes. I don't believe them already. Wooh! Wooh! Time! Yes... One second. Suffering soaking catfishes! - You took the words out of my mouth. - And the ball. Blistering barnacles. Let's change sports. Hold fast, Snowy, I'm with you! Argh! What do you think that landlubber was up to? Landlubber you say? I would say he was a sea robber. - Covered with rubber. - Yes, a rubber-covered robber. - A robber-covered... - A frogman. Even if the lake does have a curse on it, it sure is pretty. Don't be deceived, Tintin. You can never be sure of anything here. - Niko! - It's Nouchka! Hurry! This way! Help! Help! I've got you. Don't worry. The rock's giving way! Jump! Quick! Whoa! You weren't kidding, Niko. This place is unsafe. Airborne publicity here in the middle of nowhere? There's something funny going on. The camera angle is perfect, Pilot. You have hit the nail on the head. Good work. His name is Tintin. He is the most dangerous one of all. So... initiate Operation Crab. Employ special new laughing gas. A piece of a swim fin retrieved by Snowy. They swiped the Professor's notes. I'm beginning to see things clearer. Thomson and Thompson, you stay here. You, Captain, take Gustav with you. We'll use this to pick up the scent. With luck, the dogs may lead us to our slippery frogman. Go to it, Snowy! Smell him out! Doggone! Look at that dog go! He never tires! Say, these are truck tracks. Now, that's odd. A truck here? Snowy, this is no time to dig up old bones. Hey, what could that be? Shucks! Might as well save my breath. There's got to be another way out of here. By gosh, it's Ali Baba's cave, and they're all masterpieces! They must be worth millions. I'm beginning to see the light. That's what the Thompsons meant. All these works of art were stolen from different museums. I've got to get to the police. But first, I've got to get out of here. That's one way out, but it's out for me. Hey, that glow! It's coming through a tunnel that must lead to the lake! I have to try it. Thanks, Snowy. Now back to the house, quick. - What a strange machine, Professor. - I'll explain. I place my product there. - And then... - No! I place the object to be reproduced here. Then, I simply press the switch. And... presto! The product is immediately transformed into an exact copy of the model. It's a miracle! Hmm... it's like having a new hat. Congratulations, Professor. Indeed, one might even say, Professor, hats off. - Boo-hoo! - Oh, my! Too bad. I have not yet succeeded, though I do get good copies, but with limited stability so far. But I'll work that out in a day or two. They've attacked the house! Let's go get them, Snowy! Clear off, filibusters! Hit the plaza! Go, Snowy! - It's too late, Captain. - Greetings, my dear Tintin. Thundering Typhoons! Nothing will happen to your young friends if you follow my orders to the letter. I know that the professor is close to perfecting his invention. I want that machine, Tintin, and you are going to bring it to me, at noon, two days from today on the south beach. You will come alone and unarmed. Above all, not a word to the police, for the sake of your young friends. A pirate! That voice... I know it. Where from? Those two poor kids. - We'll have to play it close. - We'll get them back, by thunderation. We're up against a big gang. One thing is sure, they're watching us. - This place must be bugged everywhere. - Well, let's find the mics. - Nothing down here. - We'll look up there. I can smell 'em. In there. Uh-oh. Up, up, up. Ah! Clumsy! Pot in front of my eyes! And I kicked the... the bucket. The clock? You think so, Snowy? - Look here, Captain. - Blistering barnacles! That has to be the way those landlubbers got in. You take this along. - You wait here. I'll take a look around. - Right. Only don't take chances. It's about time to get in contact with Agent Ramses. Well, where's she going now? I'll be doggone! A walkie-talkie. This is the well where Madam Vlek pretends to come for water. Madam Vlek sure goes for a lot of water. Bleurgh! We're not as dumb as you thought, are we, Madam Vlek? Agent Ramses just blew her cover, sir! About face, Madam Vlek. Back to the house, and no funny business. That's using your head. Madam Vlek? A spy? Oh, I can't believe my ears. She's not up to Mata Hari's standards, by thunderation. You had us all fooled for a while, deary. There are ways to get her to talk if you'll let me try. OK? There's no need, Captain. Madam Vlek wouldn't know Mr Big's identity in any case. She's small fry. As I see it, there's only one way. Come closer, my darling little children. Don't be afraid, my little chickadees. Hee-hee! Come closer! - Keep your hands off my sister or else! - Niko, be still. The kid sounds like Tintin himself. Hee-hee-hee! OK, lock them up! - The beast! - Nobody's ever going to find us again! Please don't cry any more, Nouchka. Tintin won't let us down, you know that. I wouldn't be too sure, kid. Heh-heh-heh! Great Shark calling. Double the guard. Cut out all communication from the house. And don't let anybody leave the place. Don't take chances, my boy. I'll be careful, Captain, but I must notify the police. Report that they're pacing up and down. They're worried. Good boy, Snowy. Anybody home? Larisos, they're prowlers. Call the police, quick! - Anybody home? - No, nobody's home. Go away. Open the door! I won't hurt you. I just want to use your telephone. Who are you kidding? I am not opening up except to look. Also to shoot, like this. Larisos, you missed. I think I'd better call the police. That's a good idea. Hello! Operator, can you hear? Yeah? Police, and hurry! Hello! Hello? Can you hear? No? They've cut all the telephone lines! Let's go, Snowy. Why, it's Signora Castafiore! I must be dreaming. It's Tintin. What are you doing wandering around in the dark by yourself? Signora Castafiore, can you do me a favour? - I have to get to a police station at once. - Take the wheel. It's yours, my dear. In any case, Walter goes too slow for me. He can't even make the car go. I'll be right back. It's the pilot who tried to kill us! I have to get by. I think I have an idea. Irma, I'll be needing your help. That's him. I recognise the mutt. No, don't hurt me! No, wait! - Don't! - Curses! Foiled again. Oh! Murder! Help! They're killing him! Policeman! Policeman! Help! Arrest them! Arrest the murderers! - Don't let them escape! - Get the murderers! Hurry! This is Walter, my accompanist, and he is superb. He's just been assaulted by those ruffians. Do you have a passport? Who are you? Who am I, young man? Who am I? - You've got powerful friends. - What do you think, Captain? Everything you've told us confirms that all trails seem to lead into the lake, but we're here in Syldavia and more than half of the lake is in Borduria. This brings up a delicate diplomatic problem. I understand. It makes things difficult for you. In that case, Captain, all I ask is your support and a free hand. The thing is, that my friend, Professor Calculus, has perfected a new pocket submarine. We used it in our search for the treasure of a pirate, a chap named Rackham The Red. Hello? What?! A truck headed for the house? Oh, yes. Let it pass. After all, old Calculus is only working for us. He's been gone two whole days! Two whole days and no news at all. But no news is good news? I didn't order anything to be delivered. Ah, I got news for you. Galloping guppies! It's Tintin! Right, and I've brought a surprise. The Professor's submarine. I've got to meet the crooks on the beach, Captain. You're going to follow me in the sub without being seen. Gotcha. You can always count on the navy. Anchors aweigh! Captain, it's time for the meeting with the crooks. You're putting your head in the sea lion's mouth. No choice. I've got to get those kids back. - All ready, Professor? - No, no, no, no. In just a minute. Now, be careful, Tintin. This model is very special. No, Snowy. This time, I'm afraid I've got to go alone. You stay and look after the captain. They should be here soon. I wonder where they'll come from. No police boats in sight, and no helicopters. He's alone. OK, surface. A submarine. I might have known. Sub to Great Shark. Tintin is on time. We'll pick him up at once. Over. I'll be back as soon as we get a fix on their base. Wait for me here, you hear? I am sick of being showered with orders. - If you ask me, the captain is all wet. - A-A-And so are we. We're going in. Get ready for a big surprise, Mr Tintin. Say, nice setup. From the looks of it, I'd say business is good. Ah, there you are, my dear Tintin. Rastapopoulos. - You again! - Me again. And more alert than ever, my dear chap. How do you like my modest little domain? Hidden from the world and the police. Ah, so, you have the reproduction machine. Splendid. I owe you a great deal, my dear Tintin. You have the machine. I want those children. Go and get the kids, Ralph. They are nice brats, I will have to admit. Hurry! - We don't even know which way is out! - We'll soon find out. You little devils! Jailbreak! Sound the alarm! Oh, look at that! - They're in with the amphibian! - They're blocked in there! What do we do? I can't figure out these controls. Open the gate. Hurry! Ah! Here they come! The window's broken! Close the waterproof doors! Yay! Yes, Chief, with the amphibian. The glass broke. It's unbreakable, you say? They didn't know, I guess. Imbeciles! You make the mess and I have to straighten it out! Look, there's the village they flooded. So, our little friends have escaped, you think? Well, they won't get far. We are going to have a little sport, very deadly sport. What's happening now? - I'm scared, Niko. - Heh-heh-heh! How amusing, eh, Tintin? I play piano good, don't I? You like? Now, down to business. Return home. Thundering codfish, it's one-way. Oh, what a lamebrain! I think I'm too law-abiding, Snowy. Submarine! Where did it come from? A close-up. Why, it's your old friend the captain, Tintin. Did you think I was so stupid? Niko, look! A tank. I must be dreaming. I've got the right of way, you Sunday driver! - Captain! - Captain! - Hey, yoo-hoo! - Yoo-hoo! Blundering barracuda! It's the two we're looking for. Like watching television, eh? - Programme will be ending soon. - No! You're not going to use that! I wouldn't dream of it. Niko, this is terrible! We're shooting rockets at the captain! We've got to make it stop firing. Boy... Let me go, you bunch of pirates! He's mine. Blistering barnacles! They hit the rudder! I found it! Niko, you're so clever. It doesn't work! Humph! Anyway, the captain is out of commission. The captain and Snowy! You monster! The game's over, and you lose. Back to base. While we wait for our young friends to return, let me show you my art collection, every one a genuine masterpiece, needless to say, from which the Professor's machine will create masterpieces just as genuine. Masterpieces from masterpieces. Your greed will destroy you, Rastapopoulos. Think so? The only one to be destroyed... will be you. Oh, shoot! They got us. - We got the brats, as you ordered, sir. - I know. I ordered it. So, now I try out this miraculous device, yes? I reproduce first something simple. Ah-ha! A victory! It is perfect! The imitation seems, to me, to be growing, sir. Oh, don't be silly. Growing? No! It's... It's... Oh, no! The boss wants to see you two. I have been cheated! But Rastapopoulos knows how to treat those who cheat him. - Niko! Nouchka! - Tintin, you're here too? Of course he's here. He's here and he will stay here. Boss! Boss! - The police! - What? The police? On the surface, sir, police boats! Oh, by Lucifer, you're going to pay for this! Oh, yeah? I think you're the one who's going to pay. Rastapopoulos never pays. I'm not done yet. I'll make my escape through my escape hatch. Well, toodle-oo. You have one hour left. When the water level reaches this device, it will be ta-ta, Tintin. - I'm sorry I can't stay to watch. - Wait. You promised to free the children. So I did, but in return for the real machine only. You tried to pull a fast one, my friend. You weren't sparking well. You have one hour. Enjoy yourself. Now, get it straight. Work in teams of two. Transfer all the masterpieces to the cave. Got it? Good. Creeping codfish! The fella who wrote this manual couldn't read. Let's see... Breakdowns. Repairs... Propellers. Bah! This thing's no help! I fixed it! Suffering shad roe! We picked us up a couple of stowaways! There's no doubt in my mind. The key to the case is in this lake. I agree, but further, Thomson, if the key is in the lake, with the case, we'd better get to the bottom of it. If there's anything I hate, it's freeloaders, Snowy. Ah, the police. About time, by thunderation. What's going on, Haddock? What do you mean, "What's going on?" We found the gang's hideaway. My poor Thompson, you're putting on too much weight. You're a little fat yourself. Poor Thompson, I think it's your kidneys. You're holding water. Tintin's in that sunken village. We'll need some divers. I tell you, he's down there with the kids. It's no use. We'll never be able to do it. We can't break the chain. Ready, boss? The base has been evacuated. Very well. The time has come to go. Once more. There's only one thing to do. Tear the pipe loose. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave! We did it! Hurry, kids! I don't think Rastapopoulos was joking. Don't be scared. Nouchka, give me a hairpin. It's open! Hurry! Tintin, do you think we can really make it? I'm sure we can. Hurry. Faster! Faster! Oh, the hatches. Put on the life jackets, quick! Fill your lungs as full as you can. I'll open the hatch. Only a few seconds to go, and Mr Tintin will be gone forever and good riddance. He went too far. It's Tintin! Lower a boat, quick! Everybody overboard! All right! We're here! Get the children on board! I've got you, Tintin. Hold fast! I'm coming! Look! - Are you all right, kids? - We're OK, Tintin. Are you all right? Oh... No wonder sailors hate the water. Captain Haddock's ready to go into dry dock. By the great horn spoon! What a wave! What about Rastapopoulos and his gang? Rastapopoulos? So that's who it is, eh? He's going to pay, I assure you. Maybe he's still at large, but his gang is not. We're picking them off two by two, like fish in a barrel. I had an awful thought. What if they forget to come for us? No need to worry, son. The police are like elephants. We never forget. Message for you, Captain. Submarine Rastapopoulos spotted, off the coast of Borduria. We're stymied. I can take no official action. What? You mean let that rattlesnake get away? We sit here while that underwater sidewinder escapes? I say no! We can act. We're not Syldavian citizens. Just give us a high-powered motorboat. It might work. I'll do it! Cast off the lines! Full speed ahead. - Hey! - Hold on a minute! - Hold on! - Stop! Nothing in sight. Still, I've got a feeling we're being followed. Hey, look, it's the Thompsons. They're water-ski freaks. The Thompsons? Water-ski freaks? Oh, ten thousand thundering typhoons! Tintin, stop! Avast! Look. Oh, they can't swim. The numbskulls will drown. Hey, climb aboard. Never mind us. Full speed ahead. Duty first. You go ahead. We'll manage all right. Yes, duty first. You... We'll manage. The sunny shores of Borduria. Hee-hee! We are safe! Steer clear of the border posts and head for Dragon Rock. Full speed ahead, Commander. But we'll never get over the reef. The rocks are too dangerous. Commander, we're not going over the reef, but through it. Ready? - Dive. - You're the boss. Slowly. Dive angle, 30 degrees. - But Chief... - Slowly. - Reduce speed. - Yeah, but Chief... Reduce speed! - Slower still. - All right. Level off, Commander. There is our passage. Heh-hee! But sir, are you sure we can get by with that clearance? We go through like greased pork, silly. The divers have verified the diameter of the passage against the submarine. - But with the periscope still up? - What? The periscope! Quick! To the surface! Faster! Not a sign of it anywhere. How could it have gotten through? Stop! Look over there. It's an oil slick. - It has to be them. - He steals pictures, then pollutes lakes. It's your fault, imbecile! You forgot to remind me I should down periscope, yes? - But chief, you're always the one who... - Shut up! You are out of a job, Commander. As of now, you're fired. Board the pirates! Hang them from the mizzenmast! I'm sorry it had to end this way. So long, Chief. The cruise is over, matey! Ow! Thunderation! Curses! Tintin and Haddock! Don't trouble yourselves over me. I'm just passing through. You'll never get away with this! And now the big moment, folks! The Bordurians are coming back strong. Rinkydink has the ball. He passes to Boca, who fakes. He kicks high. Rinkydink comes up again. Vlasov moves in on him. Vlasov bumps his head. What a game! Sprinting down the field! He shoots! He scores! He scores! The crowd goes wild! This time, the victory was clear-cut, and a great win it was. - Now the national anthem. - I say make sport, not war. Hey! By my great aunt Brudhilde, do my eyes deceive me? Hello? Is that you, Wenceslas? Listen, you know your crazy cousin, the one who buys up scrap metal? I think I've got a little deal for him. Syldavia owes you a great deal, Tintin. Thank you. We're really very grateful, and what's more, we appreciate it. Bravo, young stranger! Bravo! We're going to celebrate. The whole village is throwing a party for you and your friends. How about that? News spreads fast here, doesn't it? Holy mackerel! They're here from all over! Yoo-hoo! Ah, hello, young prowling foreigner. I always was sure you were a good boy. You can call on me any old time. Ah, the blushdiga! Come and dance the blushdiga! What's the blushdiga? The blushdiga? You'll have to show me how to dance it. - Sure. Come on. It's not difficult. - I'll show you how, Tintin. - There's a party going on. - Well, let's be a party to the party. No, no, no, carry on, my friends. Tidal wave! Man overboard! Yoo-hoo! It's me. I see you, Captain Shadrach. Why are you hiding? Shy boy. Shall we dance? Oh, my dear Captain Rock Bass, you dance divinely. Oh, to think it's the first time I've ever danced with you. Why, Captain, you've shrunk!
