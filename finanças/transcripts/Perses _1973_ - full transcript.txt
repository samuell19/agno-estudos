Now it's up to you. Great deeds await you. Remember: the strength of your hands should only serve Good. I swear! Now go in Athens. King Aegeus lives there. He is your father. By your sandals and sword, he'll know who you are. My king, the ship from Crete has come for the tribute. Ooh. That shameful... shameful, terrible tribute! There's another thing, my king. Through the fields of the land roams a terrible wild boar. He devours people... But there is more trouble... People also tell about the robber called Procrustes... Be silent... Be silent... It's... the Gods sending me trials. You must be tired, traveler. Perhaps you wish to eat or have a rest. I have a bed for you, the bed of Procrustes. My journey is still far. Your offer is more than welcome. Thanks a lot! Well, my friend, just lay down. A rest will do you good. Yeah, I guessed so. Your length doesn't keep within normal limits. Limits!? All the world's trouble comes from not having an equal and uniform measure for everything. My bed here is a true measure for man. It's necessary to normalize you. - How will you do that? - Very simple... I will chop off your feet. - And if I were shorter than your bed? - I would stretch you out... What are you doing? My friend... You are too long by an entire head! Let me cut it to the right measure! What's happening here? Don't ask, stranger. It's the terrible tribute... that our king Aegus pays to king of Crete. To Minos... Every nine years, the seven finest young men and the seven finest girls are sent to Crete to get eaten by the Minotaur. Oh, my son. My only son! Oh! Damn you king Aegus. You kill our children. May the Olympic Gods punish you! Let me in to the king! Who are you, stranger? What is this? My sword... and sandals? You've come... my son. I waited for you Theseus, my successor! Let it be known to all people! Wait, father... At first I should rescue these unfortunate people. What do you want to do? I shall kill the Minotaur. One on one? You don't know what a monster it is. The Minotaur is an evil that cannot be defeated. Don't be afraid, father. The strength in my hands shall serve Good. You will see... I will come back under a white sail. But if I am fated to die, the sail will remain black. Let this young man stay with his mother. I will replace him. It's too early to despair. To believe in victory, is to be already halfway victorious. So the wise centaur Chiron taught me. Land! The island of Crete! Father, does the Minotaur again demand victims? It is the will of the gods, my daughter Ariadne. Praise to Dionysus... They have arrived. Is there really no person that can kill the Minotaur? What are you talking about? The Minotaur is our foundation. Our enemies are afraid of us, and that's very good. I would like to see the man who would dare listen to you. He would never escape! Praise to Dionysus. Nobody has yet found an exit from the labyrinth. Nobody! Hah hah hah. Nobody yet has not found an exit from the labyrinth! Nobody! Brave young man! Kill the Minotaur. This thread will help you to find the way back from the labyrinth. Oh Gods, send him good luck! We need to keep together! He has defeated the Minotaur. Follow me, friends. I have the thread from Ariadne. We're leaving. Wake up king. Terrible misfortune! The Minotaur is killed. Your daughter has escaped with the victor. - Catch them! Return them! The bottoms of our ships are pierced. They are being repaired now. Och gods, help me... Return my daughter and I will pay back you with a great sacrifice. I swear to Dionysus. Your entreaty is heard, king... I am Dionysus, whom you praised so often. I'll help you... I swear by Zeus. Hey friends, bring down the black sail. We will return to Athens under a white sail! As winners! - Theseus! - Ariadne! - Is there a ship visible yet? - No, nothing is visible, O Sovereign. - King, I see...I see the ship - What sail does it carry? White or black? What color is the sail? Ohh, the sail is black. He has been torn to pieces by Minotaur. The damnation has come true. Theseus! Your father Aegeus will not be forgotten. This sea will be given the name Aegean Sea by the people. You are expected to new and more glorious deeds. THE END
