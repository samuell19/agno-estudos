I'm coming! Female Delinquent: A Docu-Drama That's awesome! Stop flirting. We don't want to play with you today. Are you Naoko? Nao as in the kanji for straightforward? Wrong. It's the one for right angle. Mako was transferred after you quit school. - From where? - Juvie. She said she wanted to meet you. Why? Because I heard you were a brave girl. Maybe I was wrong. Well, we'll see. Will you get rid of it? I won't. Why? It looks miserable. This not your business. - I have to look at it. - So look somewhere else. Easy, easy... I quit. I quit drinking, smoking and eating sweets. Wow... Unbelievable! Is she really our Mako? Until the baby is out...

Of course. You are very brave. I can't believe you came here by taxi when your water broke. Is there any hospital you have frequented? No. I've learned from a book. I've been training my body for painless delivery as well. It seems you really are 16 years old. How about the school? High school? I quit. Doctor... I want you to call a person called Yazaki. The baby's father? No. In your case, the water broke before you went into labor. So we have to initiate labor by artificial means. In other words, painless delivery is not possible. I hate pain. The medication you are taking will initiate labor. What did I train for, then? - Hey! - Mr. Yazaki! Look at yourself... I thought you had been strangely quiet for a while... Sorry. Did you Chang your hairstyle? Don't change the topic. Besides giving birth, will you have a good relationship with him from now on? I don't know. But that's fine. What? I've made my decision. I don't understand what you are thinking. You don't. It would be hard for you, Mister. Didn't I tell you not to call me Mister? You never listen to what I tell you. Sorry. Has Tokio visited you yet? He went to Tokyo. Okay... No choice, then. I will take care of you. Thank you! Have you called your parents? Hey! You have to... Mister! Please! Don't tell my parents! I don't want to bother them. This is different. I will call them myself. What's up? My stomach! The nurse! Hurry! Now! She is in good condition. I really appreciate you. My pleasure. She needs to take this every hour. Ah, really? Yoko, she said it should be taken every hour. Take care for now... Thank you for your work. Give birth to the baby and come home. How could you get pregnant without telling us? This is very wrong. No! Never! I am already over 60. I am tired of all this. That's true. He won't treat you badly anymore. I don't trust him. Come home. I will raise the baby. Think it over. Go back to school. - I don't want to. - Why? Because I already quit. I don't regret a thing. You are such a hopeless girl. Are you the baby's father? Well... I think so... You think so? As a guy, I can't be sure that the baby is mine. Is there another possibility? The baby is his. Don't try me with those pathetic jokes... - I've been worried about you. - Liar. You told me to get an abortion. I didn't have any courage. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. Where's the baby? I want to go see him. In the newborn nursery. We are going to register the baby under our family. Let's make him your younger brother. Don't be stupid! The baby is mine! I will take care of him! What? - I have you. - Okay... Who do you love more? Me or the brat? Don't talk nonsense! Yes! - Hey! - Come in. - Here you are. - Thank you. I've come to see your baby. - This way? - Yeah. He's cute. - Think so? - He has big hands. He should become a pianist. - What's his name? - Taro. I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Do you work? Yes. We need to put food on the table. How is the baby doing while you are working? Mr. Yazaki, this is none of your business! Sorry. Sorry for the intrusion. Why do you take care of her all the time? You are not her teacher anymore. She is not your student either. Tokio! That's alright. I'm leaving. He is taking care of the baby. How? The bar opens at 4 PM and ends at 11 PM, but he's always available, clay and night. Okay... That's the situation... That's right. I got fired. I'm like a pimp. Sorry for making you say things like that. If you really care about her, you can help us financially. Tokio! Pathetic! Sorry for saying stupid things. Hey! Let me go! - Bitch! - What are you doing? I'm leaving for work. Why don't you take a clay off? Just one day. Are you angry? Don't forget feeding him milk. And change the diapers too. Why are you dazed today? Do you miss it? You used to be in there as well. Has it only been 1 year since then? It feels like 10 years for me. You must be trying hard, Mako. I need money. What is this, Lone Wolf & Cub? This is Mako's husband. Wow... He is cute. Is Mako alright? She doesn't go out much these days. That must be hard for her. That's what you get for making a baby without planning. Naoko may go to juvie again. - Saeko! A call for you! - Yes! I think it's too early for this, but would you like to go to the club? - I'd rather stay here for now. - Okay, then. Nobody's home, right? Not until night. What do you usually eat? I just make something quickly. Looks good, right? Why does he always cry like this right after she leaves? Okay, okay. Cry, cry. Yes! - Did you see her on the way? - I did. She is working hard. Yeah, yeah. I'm taking him home. Have you talked with Mako? I saw her leave. Tell her to come back home if she wants to see him. It's the best for you as well. Too much affection in public. Sorry. There is no bartender here? That must be hard. - Thank you. - Come again. He is out, taking care of some bar-related business. He's a good guy. I dig a lot of money out of him! Don't say stupid things! By the way, Naoko told me that she slept with your husband. Are you sure? Where did he meet her? We hung out at the club once. That's rig ht. He brought the baby there. Idiot. He hasn't found a job yet? He doesn't seem interested. It's like if you had two kids, Mako. Mister! That's enough. Mister! Mister! Already? How much? - 9,500 yen please. - Okay. Where is my wallet? Mister, please stop making jokes like that. I'm not joking. It was there. What should we do? Should we call the police? Or do you want me to follow you home? No way! If my wife finds out that I drink in a bar like this... What should we do then? That's mean. This is a violent bar! Wait! Wake up! Wake up! - What's up? - Where is Taro? Your father took him. Why didn't you stop him? He insisted. Liar! You wanted him to get rid of the annoying baby! Coward! We have to be more realistic. Just trying hard doesn't guarantee our survival! That's enough! I don't want to see your face anymore! I'm leaving. Don't say things like that. Ask Naoko to comfort you. What? Without Taro, I have no reason to be with you. Shit! Try me! I'm serious! I got it. I'll get out of here. That idiot... So you haven't seen him since? Of course not. He took the whole 70,000. Your must be still waiting for him in your heart. No way! Why? You look powerless. I no hanger see the energy you used to have. Do I really look that way? Having sex for the first time and living together at the age of 15. Giving birth and getting separated at the age of 16. You have kind of experienced a summarized version of a human life. I wonder what you will become at the age of 20... A grandma, maybe? Try harder! I won't preach at you anymore. Don't be afraid of standing out. Reinvent yourself. Do you still have time? It's Sunday anyway. Okay... Let's have some more to drink. Mr. Yazaki, what happened to Sakiko? Well... I wasn't good enough. - Unfortunate. - Tetsu! Mr. Yazaki! Could you do me a favor? What? Could you lend me some money? Okay. 20-30,000? 50,000! You have become pretty bold. Fine with me. I'll definitely pay you back. She's the first girl you've brought in a while. Not true. Maybe it's the first time you brought her here. Cut the crap. I was wondering if you were that way . Hey! What are you doing? Stop it! That's enough. We are drinking here. That's right. Stop. Know your line. That was mean. I was only joking. Actually, I will leave for the U.S. at the end of the month. I will study there for several years. That's why I called you. So... you don't have to pay me back. Weird room... All of my stuff has been moved. Drink? I've had enough. - Are you surprised? - I've been admiring you. You've hidden your feelings so far. That's all. Don't admire anyone. Wait! You get naked too, Mister. I am not Mister! What's wrong with Mister? It's weird for me to see you behave like a tough guy. Actually, I like it when you treat me roughly. Hatsuse Village, Miura City I had some business in the area. So I dropped by to see the baby. How dare you? I understand. Why did you let him in? It's because... Get out! Thank you. Bye. You came. I haven't come back home yet. I knew you would say that. Here! Money for raising the baby. 50,000 yen. I want you to have this now. What is this? I will try to send some every month. He has grown a lot, right? - Compared to last time... - Yes. There, there... This train is headed to Oshiage. The next station is Keihin-Nagahama. I heard you've separated from your husband. You want to ask me how I know, right? He came to my house. I sent him away. I don't want to take what' 5 yours. Why don't you say something? Are you too shocked to say anything? Get off at the next station. Where are we going? You know where. Come! Coward! Can't even have a proper fight? This looks pretty serious. - It hurts, right? - I'm fine. Good evening. Good evening... What happened, Mako? It seems she had a fight. This isn't good. Go home. - It's alright. - No, it isn't! You'll drive the customers away! I can't risk rumors going around the bar. Anyway, please go home. I quit. - I didn't mean to... - She's right, Mako... No, I might be bad for the bar. She might come to the bar for revenge She just entered juvie and it'll all be over anyway. Please give me my pay until yesterday. - Here you are. - Thank you for coming. I told you last time. 1 Year Later There isn't even any ice. What are you doing? I don't have to tell you that... Mako! What happened to you? You ran away from your apartment. The one who did that to Naoko was you, right? I didn't think you could do something like that. Are you saying Naoko has been looking for me? No! Don't you know? Naoko went crazy after that and quit school. I heard she's in a mental hospital. That broke all of a sudden. So I didn't like it... - Let's go together. Really. - Thank you. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you for the drink. - Here. - Thanks. Let's drink. - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! You should quit as soon as possible. Otherwise, you will be in big trouble. If you can actually quit, that is. Once you start, it's not easy to quit. Would you take me with you next time? Pride and Confidence of Young People The Japan Defense Force is Recruiting The guy we talked about before? Yes. I went to the city office to get information on the recruitment. I saw him there. He was wearing a tie and had a serious face. - So he's working at the city office. - Department head, maybe. Pathetic bastard. What do you want me to do? I think we can make some money with this. You need it too. Let's take him. Mako! What? Have you been doing drugs? I want to quit... Impossible. So you need a reason. Well... Nobody knows what will happen next in life. But... Hey! Where is Harumi? You can quit if you get help, right? Let's stay up there until the drinks run out. Okay. Taeko and I... I don't want to hear... None of my business... Are you serious? Mr. Sugitani from the security department? That's me. - Can we talk about something? - About what? Something serious, particularly relevant to you. Stop this nonsense! What? Stop it! Who are you? Don't you remember her face? Who are you? Are you familiar with a bar called Bam Bam? Well... I will call the police! Do you really want to publicize this matter? Start the car. I know you are afraid of your wife. So what? Listen to our demands. I will visit the city office to collect the money at 1 PM tomorrow. The amount is 3,000,000. No way! How about now? Okay! You promise? Yes. Your bar's closed tonight, right? Let's celebrate! Mako! Asa! Please! Could you stay with me? I can't be alone. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm cold. Idiot! I told you to keep me calm! Idiot! Hey! Let me go! I won't screw up. Idiot! I told you to let me go! Why? Shut up, bitch! Idiot! Let me go! Hurry! Why? Idiot! Idiot! Let me go! Did he trick us? I'll check. She says he's on leave. What should we do? Excuse me... I am Sugitani's wife. What? The reason why he is on leave is a stomachache. He didn't intend to avoid you. I didn't want you to misunderstand. - So I came on his behalf. - Where is the money? There isn't any. I don't intend to pay. You know what will happen, right? - What? - We'll inform the police. Please do. That's his karma. But you will be charged with blackmail too. The amount he didn't pay was 9,500 yen, right? Hey! You are not as reckless as I thought. Having a husband like him is not easy for me either. Okay then. Is it really okay? We could've taken all. Do we give up at this point? Well... We lost this time. I can't give up like this... I've been thinking about it too... Ouch! Not today. Today we are at Omura Bay in Nagasaki Prefecture. The bay is still without any pollution... Who is it? I'm the deputy head's daughter. Mr. Mizuki's daughter? My father has said good things about you. Mr. Mizuki has a daughter? What? The change. I took too much yesterday . Stop saying stupid things! Come in! What are you going to do? No! Stop it! No! Ouch! That hurt! Bitch! Stop it! No! No! Please, no! Stop! Don't be too rough! I know! Stop it! We won't stop! Just like you risked your life for this game, so did we. Miss. No! - Want me to pick up? - Don't. BI want to, though. Could be your husband... Please. Don't. No! Hello. Sugitani's house. Who are you? Want to talk to your wife? Let me go! What is your plan? I will join the defense force. Go for it. And you? I'll visit my parents' house. I see... He must be thinking that we are together. Maybe... There, there... The End
