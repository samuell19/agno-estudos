Ang-Ku, long time no see. What are you doing here? Where are you going? Why so many people? Chickening out? Come on. Stop running. Where are you going? Cut it out. Take it easy. Put down the blade. Back up. -Put down the blade. Are you nuts? Don't come over! Bring it on! What are you doing? I'll kill you! Live in paradise... Don't run! Stop running. You're asking for it. You're dead. I don't have money. If you want my life, come and take it! It's not that. If I don't get money off you today, my company won't let me of the hook. How about this? Let's die together. Here, your turn. A-Cheng, I beg you. My money is for my son's surgery. Save it. Everyone who owes money has a sick child. It's the truth. He's been crippled since birth. The doctor says if doesn't have surgery soon, he won't even be able to use a wheelchair. Please, I beg you, A-Cheng. Let's go, nothing to see here. A-Cheng After I die, can you please leave my family alone? All right. When's your son's surgery? Okay then. If he's having surgery, you'll have to watch his nutrition. Go buy some supplements. Take it! Don't go to "Chia Hsing" behind the station or "Chien Chiang Pharmacy". They're both sketchy. A-Cheng Thank you, A-Cheng! A-Cheng, your nose... Are you new? Never seen blood before? That incense burner was real hard. Can we please talk about it? Don't do that! What is that? It's gasoline! That's dangerous! I'll get you a bottle too! Gasoline is very dangerous! I'm not refusing to pay back the money. It's just that business has been bad lately. I'll give you this first. Don't be mad. Please, I'm sorry. Thank you. Here you go. Why don't you come drink with me? I haven't been drinking. What if I get drunk? The economy is terrible. Take care! Thank you. Thank you. What the hell? I don't eat sweet potato leaves. Just eat it. Stop whining. I'm going. Wait! A-Cheng, this is for you. It's delicious. Take it with you. Super tasty. Very sweet. Taiwanese people always come to buy it. You're leaving? A-Cheng, Tam Biét! Tam Biét Tam Biét Da Bien! Da Bien! (Chinese: Poop) What kind of beauty tea is this? It's disgusting. Mango, take this. I don't think it's too bad. Madam Tsai. A-Cheng wanted to give you this treat. He didn't even greet me when he came back. No need to pretend to be nice. This is from Vietnamese Yoyo's Black Dog Seafood Stall. NT$5,000...$3,000...$4,000... Why is it always a bit off? What? What's a bit off? The collected money. They owe several millions. If it's a bit off every time, when will they ever pay off the debt? Or should T just Kill a few Mangos to feed everybody? Madam, it's got nothing to do with them. Now you start talking. What is it this time? The guy at the temple has a sick kid. What about the other one? That one has a sick grandmother. You're really giving me headaches. I give you all the high interest ones but you keep slashing their repayments. Do I have to slash my wrists before you're happy? Of course not. The big hospital debt isn't being repaid. Go handle it. Okay Mango Prices have continued to rise since the 2014 housing boom. That hurts. What the hell is wrong with you? What number? Lead the way. Over there. I'm bathing my father. Please leave. Do you know your father owes money? Miss This is a debt assignment agreement. Have a good read. I don't have money. Why don't you take it home and study it? Or do you want a job? Yeah, Miss. You're so hot. Rich clients will love you. Sure Why don't T start now? You like to bully people, right? There are security cameras everywhere. I can sue you. Pay off the debt while I'm at it. Let's take her dad for a walk. Wait What are you doing? No! Let go! It's stuck. Fine! I'll sign! I'll sign! You hear me? (Rui Shan Farmers' Association - Hao-Ting Wu) New clients get a discount. The interest rate is lower. Repay NT$3,000 a day. You'll pay it all off in a few months. Delays cannot exceed three days. Is that clear? Here's a gift from A-Cheng. Call him if you have any problems. (Madam Teat's Friendly Society) Yeah Tell us early if you need a job. Look after your skin and figure. Break up with your boyfriend if you have one. Don't let him play with you for free. Is it okay? A-Cheng What's up with you today? You seem distracted. What's wrong? Work? Let me tell you. Compared to those other dicks, Ya-Ya still likes doing you the most. How much more do you still need? Well... I got my eyes on a handbag recently... It costs... DO RE MI FA SO You think I'm your sugar daddy? Of course not. I need to look good to get work. I need work to make money. The more I make the earlier I can pay you back. I give you money so you can pay me back? Take it. Thanks No. 99 Please come to counter 6. How can I help you? I want to make a deposit. That's my son. Miss I've noticed you many times. Do you have a boyfriend? He's 32. He's performed on piano at Sydney Opera House. He makes a lot of money. He's never had a girlfriend. Are you interested in getting to know him? He's got a lot of money. I owe a lot of money. Huh? You owe a lot of money? Oh dear...owe a lot of money... At such a young age... Owing a lot of money at her age... My goodness. NT$50 change. Thank you. Thanks. You should at least eat some. Time's not up yet. What do you want? I have a friend who asked for you. You can get paid to keep men company. Hey You make thousands, tens of thousands each time. They're all respected people too. It's just having a meal. You don't have to do nothin'. You have to eat anyway. And they sometimes even have famous singers. No thanks. If I could make thousands just having a meal, I'd be there in a flash. Then you go. Aren't I having a meal with you now? Fine, you don't have to do it. I have another idea. Just what do you want? When time's up, I'll pay. This is what I'm talking about. Don't eat so salty. A person only needs one kidney. But you know why we have two? Just in case! I know a guy who used to do this. He's removed 300-400 kidneys. No problem! I wasn't going to keep in touch, but since you're so picky... How about it? What are you... Hey! I'm giving you all the best jobs. I'll find my own way. Hot damn, she really drank it all. Uncle Get up! Get up! Get up, you pig. You stink! How much did you drink last night? Go to school. Quit nagging at me. I need money for English tutoring. Where's the money? Didn't I give you some last week? I used it on cosmetics. I need to be pretty to be selected as a K-pop trainee. What are you worried about What are you afraid of? Might as well throw money down the drain... Give me money! I'm going to be late for school! Give me money! So little? Driving me crazy. Please bless us. I don't get it. The market is NT$80 cheaper than the street vendor. It's just a few extra steps. It's only NT$80. Stop nagging. The earlier it's in our home, the earlier it makes us rich. What would you know? Move... Fine, how rich are you? I wouldn't care if you're rich, but you're not. I told you I'd buy it. You're so... Don't remove it! Go return it later. Drink your own. The more expensive one will obviously bless us more! The more expensive one will obviously bless us more! You get what you pay for, understand? Why else would deity statues be gold plated? Why else would deity statues be gold plated? Otherwise they'd be made of dirt! I'm going. Bye. Give daddy a hug. No! Go hug Mom. -Wen, drink your chicken essence. Look at my daughter. She's just like me. All grown up now. Isn't it good that I'm playing with these plants now? Good my ass! This is how you lost so much money before. Still haven't learned your lesson. What do you want then? A divorce! Always threatening divorce. Are you a child? Use chopsticks! So pissed off. Hey She's threatened divorce so many times. How about you try it for real? Look She's cleaning up. We won't divorce. If we divorced over NT$80, we'd be a laughing stock. Women have terrible temperaments. How do you usually deal with a woman like that? What's there to deal with? She just wants you to apologize. So you mean we apologize first, say what we did wrong? I did nothing wrong. An apology is an apology. It doesn't mean we did something wrong. Sit down. I know. Don't I need to check where we're at? I'll stop at your stop. Where you going so early, anyway? Shut up, you're not my dad. I AM your dad! Shouldn't you be doing something with your life? I have my destiny. It's just arriving a little later. Still reading comics at 40 and you're talking to me about destiny? Why don't you ask Mazu? Don't touch the deity! Mazu says your destiny won't arrive. Hey We're here. Stop up ahead. There's no stop here. I'm not a taxi. Hurry up. No. 101, please go to counter 6. I really think you misunderstood what I meant by "having a meal". No. 102, please go to... No. 103... As for the kidney, you might think it's unsanitary, but my friend is a professional. Whether it's the left side or right side, he can do it all. It's customized! No. 104... No. 105, please go to counter 6. No. 106... No. 107... No. 108, please go to counter 6. Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize. I was wrong, okay? Manager I already apologized. What's your problem? What is it? Hey Watch where you put your hand. No It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? I'll show you a misunderstanding! Get out here! What do you want? Don't come in here. Strand straight. Sir, you can't come in here. I'll give you a chance. Say it again! Say it properly. Which hand was it? Which hand? This one? This is a place of work. What are you doing fondling people? Wei-Hao Cheng? Is this the police? No? Still saying no? You said... he keeps trying to talk to you? Yes And he took a lot of numbered tickets? Yes Miss I think... you were in a public space. It's reasonable for people to talk to each other. Getting numbered tickets and lining up is also good. When you owe money, you should of course pay it back. It was nice of him to remind you. Probably a misunderstanding. Hey Am I boring you? What? Haven't you had enough? You come for debt collection. You come for sexual harassment. Lucky the manager didn't press charges, or else who knows how long you'd be locked up this time. What? Are the lunches here that tasty? Why else? They even have winter melon tea. Your head is a melon! This is chrysanthemum tea. Your dad's bamboo shoots are here. Oh, so quick. Yeah, tell him to come pick them up. Uncle! Wen! -Uncle. Come, sit here. No need. Say hi to big sister. Big sister. This. Drink this then. -I already have this. Then eat this. Hey... um... See ya. Tell your dad to pick it up. Okay Hurry up. Don't push me. Hey I have to take her home first, so I can't spend more time with you today. Can you not smile so disgustingly? You saw? Sign this! Or else I'll tell dad you got arrested again. You're incredible. All Fs? Sign it. So? So what? I'm asking if it looks like me. What is this? I'm trying to help you find a way so you don't have to pay the money back. It's like this. You go out with me. Each time we go out, we fill out one square. When they're all filled out, your debt counts as repaid. Understand? Go out with you? Yeah Just the two of us? Who else? One time, one square. All filled, debt repaid. So simple but you still don't get it? Aren't you a college graduate? Look at that guy. Poor bastard. Don't stare. Miss Wu. This is the bill for the latest period. We also haven't received last period's payment. Sorry to bother you. Hello? Aunty? This is Hao-Ting. Oh, Hao-Ting. Yes My dad is about to lose his hospital bed. But I really don't have money right now. Can you please lend me a little? I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Please What? I can't hear you clearly. We're busy. What do you want? I want to borrow money for Dad's hospital bills. Seriously? I don't have much money either. Who gave you my number? I'm busy. I gotta go. (Madam Teat's Friendly Society) It's just having a meal, right? That's not worth it for me. What else then? Chatting? Going for strolls? No, Miss. Do you think I'm an invalid? Might as well bathe me and push me out in a wheelchair to get some sun. Right? Or are you saying... you want to bathe me? Fine... Don't waste it. These tea leaves are expensive. At least go out with me for a drink, no? At least go out with me for a drink, no? There's still the most important thing. That... What? There's other people here. You want me to say it? You think this is funny, don't you? Okay... Okay, we'll do what you say. Eat Stroll Is that okay? I'll pay back the medical bills soon. I prepared this today especially for you. Your favorite. Got it. You're the best. Yeah, I'm the best. Bringing little girls here? Steamed Pork, My favorite. Try some. Later I'll take you blues dancing. Blues dance. What are you looking at? I'm gambling. Why are you looking? You know what? I didn't get that bag I told you about last time. This is for me? Thanks, A-Cheng. Want to come up for a hand job? I'm busy. How about an oral sex then? Oral sex today. Have you seen my rainbow pen? Quick, tell me which one. She's educated. She won't like you. Children should be seen, not heard. Is there someone here named... Goddess Wu? Hao-Ting, there are drinks today too. You're in my way. -Your garbage truck is coming. Go! No, it's YOUR garbage truck. Okay, Uncle. Time to turn over. Come on, get ready. 1, 2, 3! You lucked out. You know you have an extra son now? Uncle, can you hear me? You like me coming to chat with you? Let's go for a drive some other time. It'll be awesome, I tell ya. The pharmacy is none of your business! I'll talk to Madam Tsai, okay? So nosy. Okay...that's it for now. I'm done talking. We promise we'll pay up. Where's the money? Please stop hitting my husband. -Hand it over. Please stop! -Understand me? I promise I'll pay up. Just give me a few days. I want it now. Let's not go back to that shop. -Okay, be quiet. Let's get out of here. We'll pay it back. We'll pay back the money. -Hurry up. Hand it over. Hey A-Cheng What the fuck are you doing? In broad daylight? Get lost. Don't fucking move! What the hell are you doing here? - Get lost. Madam said they're short on every repayment. Asked us to help out. Asked you to help out? You're a big man now, aren't you? You know how to help now, right? Get inside! A-Cheng, what's going on? Get inside! No! Should we all the police? Don't get involved. Let them sort it out themselves. Do they owe money or something? That guy is so vicious. He seems always like that. Madam, what's going on with Daxing Street shop? What do you want? -Who is he? Where are your manners?! Who is he? -Take Mr. Taka back. My apologies. Please. Give him a gift. Any problem with our project? No problem. Let's complete the project together. Find a few more rich piggies. Thanks. Bye. Didn't we agree that one was my responsibility? What's going on? Did you send those guys to make a mess? Did I hear that right? Last time you said we can't collect on your girlfriend's dad. Now you say we can't collect on others either. You say make a mess? You're the one making a mess! When your brother's investments failed, it was me who financed his barber shop and let you work here to repay the debt. Fine if you don't want to collect debts. I'll get it off your brother! Mango! I haven't had a haircut in ages. Let's go now! Okay! You own me. Deal with me. Leave my family out of it. My company only has one rule: Bring money back. Nurse, where is my dad? I have a strange nickname. The Ace Killer... Minami Why did you take my dad here? Letting him get some sun. I feel bad seeing him lying in bed all day. I feel bad seeing him lying in bed all day. I'm reading this to him. He seems to like it. Hey He's getting some sun. What are you doing? I'll find a way to repay the money. Don't come looking for us again. Why? Wasn't everything fine yesterday? Move your foot. Can't we talk about this? I'm good to you because I like you. Let go. Let go! I love you! Fine, take him! Don't come back! Why do I have to wait? A-Cheng What are you doing? I'm not waiting. -What are you doing here? Don't be like this! Mister You came just in time. Teacher Chen, I'm sorry. Get out of here now. I'll call you later. -What's going on here? I told you to get out of here! Teacher Chen, I'll call you later. I have customers. Don't be like that! You're ruining my business! Don't you just want money? I'll give you however much you want. Don't be like this! A-Cheng Take off all your clothes. I told you to take it off! No! How much did you drink? Please, listen to me! Please! Take this money. Keep it. Keep the money. I'm buying your love...tonight... Take off your clothes. Enough. You've lost your mind. You've lost your mind! Let me tell you. I don't sell love. If you want sex, go fucking line up! Are you crazy? Talking about love? Even if say it, you'll know it's fake anyway. Why would you want that? I'll pay off the remaining debt and interest all in one go. Don't come looking for me again. Sir, are you okay? Let me tell you. I don't love you. I don't love you. I don't love you. I didn't mean what I said the other day. I didn't mean what I said the other day. I don't love you! I'm just... Miss Wu. It's almost time. Will other guests be coming?

Okay, tell me. Can we possibly get our own room? Can we possibly get our own room? But I just asked Miss Wu. She said no one else is coming. Miss Wu... Don't...Sorry... Sir Her father just passed. Leave her alone. Don't you think it looks too cramped? One booklet each. You have to chant the sutras later, okay? A-Cheng. Okay. Tidy it up. The cups are all over the place. Can you take things seriously? Straighten that wreath. Okay What else needs to be moved? Can't you see those things? A-Cheng I'm a Taoist priest, not a monk. I don't help people chant sutras. Shut up. You don't know how to chant "Amitabha"? Look at them! Don't block the road. Go get more stuff. Okay... There's more stuff in the car. Hello? The parking lot. I'll pay for the parking, okay? Fine... Mrs. Chang. Condolences. We didn't know A-Cheng was married. Or else we would have greeted you a long time ago. Didn't he trash your shop? No... It was other people. Luckily A-Cheng helped us out so we could continue running our shop. Family, accept courtesy. Bow Bow Please sit. Family, return courtesy. Bow Son-in-law, ready the umbrella.

I'm off. Hey Which of the two do you like better? They both seem pretty good. Hard to choose. You act like you can move in at any time. I mean... The building is so pretty, but you can't see it if you live inside. I'll bring you here to look at it for free every day. How about it? You like me, right? Weren't we talking about the buildings? Why do you like me? Seriously? What do you like about me? You have long legs. And... You smell nice. That's it. What are you doing? Aren't we going to...? Put your pants back on! Really? Back on! You weren't very good at unbuttoning the first time we met... That's enough. I'm going to work. Someone's birthday? Check out the screen. (Love You Forever) I think it's the people next to us. So it's someone's birthday? He's gonna sing. What? Coming! A-Cheng So slippery. Oh love, you are greater than I imagined And you've shown me my last great expectation You are my direction Hope you see my vision Things change any moment But I'm still the same person Love you always, till the end I really can't handle a guy like that. So embarrassing. So awkward. So tacky. -Thank God he's not my boyfriend. What! What's that? These are the drinks I want to sell. Stop perving. Look at this. I'm going to open a drink store. My company loan just got approved. Plus there's my dad's insurance money. I can probably start looking for shopfronts. The signs and hardware should cost around NT$100K. The shop doesn't need to be big. 7-10 square meters is enough. The tea has be sourced properly. The milk too. Look. I found a small farm down south. Now it's just the shopfront. Prime locations near schools are all super expensive. Hey Mm? If you're not a debt collector, what would you want to be? How would I know? Maybe a deity. Bro, I really don't have it. I'll give you the rest next week... Next week... Don't be scared. My shop's here. -I want it now. Please. I'm not going anywhere. What are you doing? Put down the knife. Put down the knife! Get out! What are you doing? (99-Day Anniversary) What happened? Sit down. Let's eat. No! What happened to you? Let's eat. How did you get hurt so badly? Let's go to the hospital. No need. I'm okay. No big deal. Today... is a happy day. Understand? How can I be happy? I've got good news. I'm changing profession. I don't want to collect debts anymore. I want to... open up the best bubble tea shop with you. Okay? The Japanese will bring more friends. Please remember the faces of the rich ones, okay? They're the piggies we're gonna hustle. Get a good look. This is the Principal. Look carefully. You always mess up. This one's a car dealer. Look properly. You're late but still have bitch face? Hurry, come here. I have business to discuss with you. I have something to tell you. These dick less guys started pissing themselves when I told them. Madam She said you're dick less. That hurts. Madam... I've decided. I'm not doing this anymore. Smoke break. 5 minutes. Let's go smoke. Sit Found a nice new job? No So it's because of that woman. Surname... Wu? She wants to open a shop. I want to do it with her. Doesn't opening a shop require money? Keep working for me. This is a great opportunity. Really! You were the first one I thought of. I know. But... I'm really leaving. I just came today to tell you. Thank you... Thanks for coming. So expensive. Are you selling burial plots? Don't get angry. Please come again. My name is Yang. The shopfront is not urgent. We can slowly save up the money. Then search when the time is right. Okay? You go back to work. I've got stuff to do. Don't come back too late. Impossible. I can guarantee you. I'm directly passing on what the landlord is charging. Stop acting stupid. I'd rather eat shit than trust you. Don't. Don't eat shit. Only rich people make real money in real estate. I'm just like you guys, trying to make a living. How about this, A-Cheng. I actually have a few more shopfronts. They're near the newly built luxury apartments. Word on the grapevine is that there's going to be a cinema here. A 3D one. Cinemas attract a lot of people. More people, more money. Think about it. What's the most important thing about watching a movie? Drinks and popcorn. Do people buy cinema drinks and popcorn? Not that many. I'll try to put your store closer to the cinema. Just imagine every person going to the movies Madam Um...that... Do you still need more people for tomorrow? What? Aren't you opening a shop? No, it's just... recently, shopfront rent is more expensive. The straight and narrow is the right of the privileged. The piggies we're hustling tomorrow are all bringing loads of money. Don't say I don't look after you. I'm still missing a bit. Put in all the money you have. The more we put in, the more we'll make. (Passbook: Meng-Cheng Chang, Hao-Ting Wu) You're home. Let me tell you. If you go to the supermarket after 7pm, all the food will be on special. Super cheap. What's this? Your favorite, steamed pork. How about it? What's this? Shopfront Choose one you like. Where will you get the money? Company retirement fund. Don't worry about it. We won't have to eat people's leftovers anymore. I thought about it all day. We can rent the shopfront later. We can also move to a smaller place. As long as the two of us are together. Are you joking? You're not going to have a bad life with me, okay? I'll wind things up at the company tomorrow. Afterward, let's go see Yang and sign a lease. Hey Mm? If we open a shop, it should be stable in about 3 months, right? Should be. Why? After it's stable, we'll wait another six months then get registered. Get married. I did the calculations. Around that time is the first anniversary of your dad's passing. I was thinking of taking you back to see him. Show your dad his daughter is being looked after, and won't be lonely anymore. What do you think? I love you. Oh! Stinks! No! It means I love you too. Love my ass! I couldn't help it. Again? Huh? Did I? (Private Function) Mr. Lin. Look after it. Okay, leave it with me. Sir, anything for safekeeping? No Two guests entering. Put down NT$500 again.

All in. Clubs Flush Showdown Four of a kind. Player No. 4 wins. My apologies. Aren't you sick of winning all night? Never sick of winning. Oh, your eyes are red. Excuse me. My apologies.

I'm already here but her boyfriend's not. Get in there! Go! It's closing time already. Can we sign today? Now? I'm really sorry. I'll call him again. Sorry I'm really sorry, Mrs. Landlady. Please, in future, when picking tenants for me, can you filter out the ones who can't afford it? Time is precious for everyone. Let's go! Excuse me. Mrs. Landlady. Mrs. Landlady, my apologies. Really, really sorry. Something must have happened today. I'll contact you. Really sorry. Where did you go? I've been looking for you all night. You don't pick up your phone. The lease wasn't signed either. Why are you hurt again? Don't you have anything to say to me? I'll go find Yang tomorrow. Ask him to contact the landlord again. I'll give him the money then. The money is gone. What did you say? The shopfront rent and the money for fittings, and our savings, and your dad's insurance money... It's all gone. Where did you take the money? Didn't we say we'd... I went gambling Gambling That was all the money we had. Forget it. We'll talk when we get home. There's nothing to talk about! This is the kind of person I am! You want this to continue? You want to get married? You're insane. Let's go home. Your dad still owes money! Have you paid it off? I give you a few cards and you think you don't have to repay it? Lunatic So you've never loved me? What do you think? Don't ever let me see you again. Shut up! Do you know what time it is? People have to sleep! Keep it down! Don't you know what time it is?

Where's Madam Tsai? You should know. She's not someone you can afford to offend now. Don't look for her. I've thought about it. The money wasn't mine. I don't want to owe anyone.

Fill out some details. Madam Tsai. Didn't I used to give you my all? Don't be so unreasonable. Give me the money and I'll leave. Please. I'll always be grateful. Give me the money and I'll leave. I'll always be grateful. -Get him a lunch box. Please Did you lose your mind in prison? You want to come, Hao-Ting? It's okay, I won't go. Again? Another time. -You always say no. Fine, but remember to eat. Get home safely. Bye. (Nice House Clean) Go away. Isn't this a bit much? Madam Sorry The money. I have to get it back. We can talk about this! What more can I say?

Just one minute, please. Please don't go. Just one minute. Your dad's all dressed up for work in the middle of the night. Go check on him. Hurry up. Relax, he won't just disappear. Dad Let's go home. You go first. I'll come home after work. I'll go with you. Yeah, let Shu-Lin go with you. Come on, let's go home. -Okay. All dressed up here in the middle of the night... All dressed up here in the middle of the night... It's all your fault! Never study and always end up at the police station. I just got back... You've got military service in two years. Grow up! The neighbors are all laughing. Your brother's business is also failing. Aren't you embarrassed? I really don't know what to say to you! Wang, I'm sorry. I'm going to discipline this child back home. I'll fold them upstairs. Don't. Get some rest first. It's okay. Fine, I'll take it. Rest if you're tired. You can do it tomorrow. This way. Don't tell me you escaped. You're making Dad do work on the side for you now? Why are you mad? You got a problem with it? Why didn't you tell me Dad was like this when you visited? Tell you what? Dad probably ended up like this because of you! What did you say? Am I wrong? What did you say? Why should I be sorry? What are you saying? Aren't you embarrassed getting Dad to do this? Uncle! Get lost! Uncle, stop it. -What are you doing? Go upstairs. Stop it! Get lost! Stop fighting! Dad, come here! The brothers are fighting! Stop it! -Fine, leave me alone. What the hell are you doing? You know nothing! Why are you hitting your brother? He's your brother! This family... You're the biggest troublemaker in this family! Wen told me. The doctor suggested it. That's why they're getting you to do handiwork. They say it helps with memory. Yeah...I've become useless. Who won that fight just then? Me, of course. He deserved it. Shu-Lin and Wen have a hard life because of him. He's made a mess of this family. He's not a man. These last few years, he's been the one bringing home the money. He's looked after all of you, right? You need to remember that. Treat him better. As for me... I have to leave tomorrow morning. Leaving so soon? What's the rush? We bought this for you to drink. It's wasted if you just leave it there. I forgot. You're like a child. Fine, forget everything. It's better that way. Don't wait till I'm gone and start lamenting all alone. Hey, you have to remember this. You've got a filial son who gives you massages. Getting married is true filial piety. Bring a daughter-in-law home. Uncle! What? Dad wants to give this to you. He says don't let Mom find out. This is from me to you. Remember to call. Take your work seriously. Don't muck about and drink all day. I know. This is for you. Put it away. Once you start dating boys, find one who makes a lot of money, okay? How many times do I have to tell you? I'm going to be an idol. I can't have a boyfriend. You have rocks in your head. Go home. That's you. Bye. Hey! You have to return my rainbow pen next time. My name is Wally. Ken and the others mention you a lot. Since the weather is good today, I was wondering if... Dinner and a movie! Let's go... It's fine. This cup is yours. Thanks Sir, are you okay? Sir, are you conscious? Hurry, call an ambulance. Sir, you shouldn't be getting up right now. We still have to run some more tests. How did I get here? A relative or friend took you here. Who? A lady. Let me see... Hao-Ting Wu. She's downstairs doing paperwork. She'll be back soon. Please lie down first. Where's the man who was just brought here? Where's the man who was just brought here? He just woke up. We wanted to do some follow-up tests but he insisted on leaving. Did he say where he was going? He did ask how late the intercity bus operated. He was released from prison early so he could get treatment. He kept it from you all, probably because he didn't want to be a burden. Sometimes he loses his temper and doesn't care he's only got half a life left. He just had to get the money back... Take the money, okay? Don't go. Just one minute. Please don't go. Just one minute. Just one minute, please. Please The bus for Daying is departing. The bus for Daying is departing. Go Weren't you going? Don't you dare go. Let's go home. Do a closer shave.

The process might be a little uncomfortable. Please bear with us. We're removing the soft needle. Miyagi points at Mitsui and says, The one who stayed in the past is you! Afterwards, everyone is silent. Anzai Sensei walks in, pushing up his glasses. As soon as Mitsui sees Anzai Sensei, he suddenly remembers what the coach once told him: Don't give up... "If you give up now, the game will end.” Your button isn't done up. It's not for you to look. Weirdo I... The first time I saw you... I already liked you. You were mean. I made your favorite steamed pork today. I made your favorite steamed pork today. Listen I found a cheap butcher. Even cheaper than the last one. I'll smash you if you say it's not delicious. It took me a long time. Hey You ignoring me? Hey After it's stable, we'll wait another six months then get registered. Get married. Show your dad his daughter is being looked after, and won't be lonely anymore. I love you too. Dad! Dad! Don't leave the house. Don't go out. Be happy today. Understand? I was going to bring your daughter-in-law home. But you know... I'm a useless person. There's a farmers' association near the markets. She works there. When her father was sick, she took care of him every day after work. She's very filial. Very good... Someone like that could put up with me. How can I tell her I'm leaving her? Blame it on fate? She's probably better off without me. It's pouring. Give me an umbrella. Now she's lost her dad. So I was thinking... Maybe you can be her dad? When I'm not here, can you be a father to her? Dad, I'm talking to you. Are you listening? Be her dad, okay? Dad! Didn't I tell you not to come out? What are you looking at? It's about to start. You really are... Unfilial son. Making trouble even in death... I'm leaving. Okay, bye. Hao-Ting Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Package delivery. What did you buy this time? Such a big box. I didn't buy anything.
