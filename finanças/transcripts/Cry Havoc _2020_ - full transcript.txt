Come on. Over. Come in, goddamn it. This is Echo Leader, over. You boys are supposed to protect my land from intruders, not become intruders! Apparently, one of your highly trained soldiers has wandered into the perimeter. He's about to step on Havoc's toes. Oh, Jesus! Yes, sir. I'll get him out of there right away, over.

We're about ready to head up to the compound. (DISTANT MOTOR RUMBLING) Who is this? He's here to collect your phone and any other electronic devices you may have. I think for safety reasons I should hang on to my phone. If you wanna interview my client, you will follow his instructions. Okay. Can I at least keep my tablet? It's a basic device reporters use. And it's a perfect tracking device for any law enforcement agency to finally find out this location. Okay, look, I get that you have to protect him. Okay, I do. All right, I get that. But I'm just here to tell the story. I mean, you should know that I'm no threat. It's obvious to me that you would like to propel your career into high gear by interviewing one of the FBI's most wanted. Okay, but I'm a known reporter and I know that your people investigated me before offering me this interview. We did, however, we weren't able to be certain whether you contacted the FBI or any other law enforcement agency that would love to take my client into custody. I never wanted this interview, Miss Weaver, but my client insisted on it. So I'm looking for any reason, any reason whatsoever, to tell him we had to cancel this interview and send you home. So you give me no choice. It all depends on how much you value your career. Ambitious girl. Collect her electronics. (DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) Echo Siren to Echo Leader. I'll be driving into grid 46 with the reporter. Do not shoot. I repeat, do not shoot, over. Copy that. I'll alert all sentries, over. And make sure the asset is nowhere near us, over.

(BIRDS SQUAWKING) We're gonna have to change your clothing. Excuse me? My client is very eccentric and he expects you to dress for the occasion. Haven't we had enough weirdness already today? I'm sure there's something in here that will fit you. Okay, I am trying to comply with your rules here, but I feel like I'm being toyed with on this one. If you want to interview the extremely wealthy, you're gonna have to get used to being toyed with. Now get changed and we'll take you to see him. Okay, well I insist on having a video camera. Any small one will do. You're pushing your luck, Miss Weaver. And you've played your hand one too many times, Mrs. Wallace. Okay, I have complied with every safety regulation and I am even willing to wear one of those ridiculous costumes for him, okay, but when I leave here with my story, I'm gonna need proof that I interviewed this man. Video proof. I'll be outside. And? And I'll allow for a small mini reorder but that's it. Understood. (DOOR CREAKING) (SOMBER MUSIC) I guess I could get all dolled up. This interview's gonna make me a star reporter. (ELLEN CHUCKLING) Let me guess, for security reasons, one of your men has to watch me undress? No. No. (ELLEN SIGHING) Just deal with it, Ellen.

(MAN CLAPPING) (LIGHTS FIZZLING) That dress is fabulous. You look beautiful in it. I think I look like a fool but it was the only one that fit me out of those ridiculous choices I was given. (MAN CHUCKLING) Your Mrs. Wallace is quite a spitfire. Oh, Mrs. Wallace. She's special. Please, have a seat. I gotta say, I'm happy to see it's really you. I can't remember the last time someone said that to me. It's just that I was unsure if the offer to interview you was genuine. I'm not famous. Not to the public, no, but to law enforcement agencies and reporters, you're Elvis. Once your story gets out, you're gonna be headline news all over the world. And so will the investigative reporter who found me. Got my fingers crossed on that one. (CAMERA ELECTRONIC CHIMING) This is Ellen Weaver reporting for Ottawa Iowa's leader in breaking news, Channel Four Action News. Please excuse my attire, it will all be self evident once you see the man I'm about to interview. He just made the FBI's Top 10 most wanted list and his identity is shrouded in such mystery, he'sonly known to law enforcement agencies as The Voyeur. Sir, thank you so much for allowing me to interview you. Thank you for allowing me to explain my work. I'd like to take this opportunity to clear up any misconceptions. I'll cut to the chase. Several law enforcement agencies all over the world have issued warrants for your arrest. They claim you've invested a fortune on what they described as macabre experiments. That's true in a way. I did inherit my family's fortune. Their wealth was vast. There's even a report stating you used that money to stage the filming of snuff films, where actresses were actually murdered. There were deaths involved, but I refuse to call my work something as loathsome as snuff films. They were true pieces of art. More than that, together they were the most honest expression of humanity that I've ever seen. And of nature, too. (CAMERA BUZZING) (INTENSE MUSIC) (WOMAN GASPING) (SINISTER MUSIC) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (HAVOC GRUNTING) (BONE CRUNCHING) (CAMERA BUZZING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (EERIE MUSIC) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (HAMMER THUDDING) So you're confirming your involvement in the snuff... Excuse me, performance pieces where actresses were actually murdered on film? There may be some that could see it that way. Look, I didn't come all this way and risk everything just for vague answers. But you said you wanted your story to be told and I'm here to tell it. But I'm gonna need straight answers. Oh, so you want to do surface reporting? That's not gonna work. If you want someone to believe you, you have to dig deep. I have a question for you. That's not why I'm here. I came a long way to ask you questions. What do you want out of life? Happiness? Is that what I'm supposed to say? Sure. Doesn't everyone want happiness? Suppose so. Almost everyone. Let me guess. Everyone but you, right? What do you want? Truth. But there isn't much happiness in the truth. Okay, we can go down this road. Why not strive for happiness like the rest of us? Truth is cold. It's fear, pain. Truth is knowing that we all are going to die someday. And that light at the end of the tunnel is not a gateway to heaven. It's a hallucination that is caused by a flood of endorphins created to help us give up the fight. And to help us give in the the sweet goodnight. Truth is realizing that if God did exist, he would be ashamed of us for being a bunch of self-serving apes that only care about accumulating wealth. The fact of the matter is, those young women that participated in our films, they experienced something that few of us ever will. They saw and they knew the truth to our existence. The real truth before they died. They were able to see the fury of nature itself and because of that, they were edified to the fullest. But they had to die to receive that edification? How do you lure these actresses to your film shoots anyway? (RADIO BUZZING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) I'm assuming they're not made aware of the reality of the situation. Most of them wanted to be celebrities. (WATER DRIPPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Not really artists, if you know what I mean. (ELECTRICAL FIZZLING) I wanted to congratulate you all for being chosen for Terror Mountain. It is the ultimate horror reality TV show and whoever wins this show gets the million dollars cash prize. (FOREBODING MUSIC) There are cameras everywhere and they're constantly rolling. (SINISTER MUSIC) (LIQUID TRICKLING) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (BONE CRUNCHING) (WOMAN WHIMPERING) (HAVOC GRUNTING) (WOMAN CRYING) And since they only wanted fame and fortune it was easy to convince them. (FOREBODING MUSIC) (SLICE SQUELCHING) (WOMAN CRYING) (CAMERA BUZZING) (HAVOC GRUNTING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) Greed and pride are deadly sins. So is murder. You mean wrath. And one day I will pay for my sins in the same way. The point is, we offered them money, we made sure they didn't have any fathers or husbands. It was easy. You mention fathers. Do you think your father turned you into the type of person who would do these things? Are you a reporter? Or are you a psychotherapist? Maybe a little of both. Tell me about your father. About his wealth. I will. But if we are going to get personal, I need you to tell me about yours first. I don't have one. Do you want to get personal with this interview that's gonna make your career? If you do, do it, get personal. We all know that the subject of fathers can get complicated. When was the last time you saw your father? What was your strongest memory of him? When my parents divorced, I went from having a father to wanting one. Okay, I would wait every day for a phone call from him. His calls were so rare it was like Christmas when he finally did bother to call. I grabbed that phone like I was opening a present. For a moment, I was happy. But then the disappointment set in because he would just complain about how my mom was the reason we were apart, how horrible she was, very little about me until, as time passed, the calls became less frequent until they finally stopped all together. I heard he started a new family. How's that? Personal enough for you? Tell me about your father. He was always there. He showed me that most people are as worthless as cattle and could be treated as such. On the topic of fathers, you said you lure in actresses who don't have fathers or husbands. Hell, I'm not married and you knew I didn't have a father, didn't you? We were very thorough in our investigation of you before we offered the interview. When was the last time one of these films were made? There is no last time. In fact, we have a couple of aspiring actresses right now on the compound waiting to be stars. So you admit to these things? About a decade ago, I found myself in a prison cell in some godforsaken place in this world. And before I even knew what I was looking at, in a cell across from mine I found it. Found what? It was just pacing in its cell. Back and forth. It didn't even understand why it wasn't allowed out. It was just pacing back and forth and I watched and I was consumed by it, and its eyes were black, all black, like a shark's, but I knew there was something else in these eyes and so I just waited and watched. And then I saw it. It was the truth. There is no lying in these eyes. It simply... was. Like a storm. And suddenly everything in my life made sense and I was able, at the moment, to start seeing the truth in our existence and of what we are. You keep saying it. Are you referring to a creature or a man? It was just a force of nature. Still is. I used to be afraid of death, but now, with Havoc, I control death. (SINISTER MUSIC) (MAN MOANING) (MEAT CRUNCHING) I am its master. (CHAINSAW RUMBLING) (MAN YELLING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) Like Beethoven was able to create such works with great beauty, Havoc can destroy with the same finesse. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) Havoc? Are you being poetic or is that the prisoner's name? No, that's just what the guards here at the compound call it. It's prisoner number A-Y-O-8-8-6. I don't know anything more than that. All I knew was that I needed to set him free. So as soon as my lawyer got me out of prison, I went right back, bribed the Warden to release prisoner number A-Y-O-8-8-6 into my custody. And? And Havoc came with me. And he has escaped from me from time to time. (WATER TRICKLING) (ROCK THUDDING) (GUNSHOTS POPPING) No! (MACHETE SLICING) (BLOOD TRICKLING) (ELECTRICAL FIZZLING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (HAVOC GROANING) As of now and over the last several years, he's been under my care. Does Havoc star in your snuff films? Oh there you go with the same slip of the tongue. I'm starting to take offense. No offense intended. It's my life's work! To answer your question, Havoc is the star of my films. Is he the executioner? Does he kill the actresses? Havoc kills anything in its path. (FOREBODING MUSIC) I carry a gun. I sleep with one under my pillow at night just in case. I think I have everything I need. Thank you so much, I should be going. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have so much more to talk about. I think I have everything, thank you so much. You don't even know my deepest darkest secret. (OMINOUS MUSIC) And what is that? I should warn you. A storm is coming. (DIAL BEEPING) (STEAM HISSING) (ELLEN COUGHING) (GUN CLICKING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (EERIE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) Where is this girl? Who the hell are you? (FOREBODING MUSIC) This is a private compound, do you have a search warrant? One last time. Where is this girl? (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GUNSHOT POPPING) (MAN GROANING) (GUNSHOT BOOMING) (MAN GRUNTING) (GUNSHOTS POPPING) (HAVOC GRUNTING) Oh my God! Help! Oh my God! Fuck! Help me! Oh my God.

(ELLEN CRYING) No. (WOMAN SCREAMING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) No! No! (WOMAN SCREAMING) (DRILL CREAKING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ELLEN CRYING) No. (DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) (ELLEN WHIMPERING) Help me, help.

(ELLEN CRYING) Please just let me go. I won't tell anyone about this place, please. Oh my God. Oh my God, you're a cop. Oh my God, thank God. I thought you were one of them. Have you seen this girl? Do you have any other police with you? Any other backup? This girl, have you seen her? What? No, no, I haven't seen anyone like that. Officer, can you call in backup? Hello? Are you listening to what I am saying? There are multiple crimes happening here, okay, murder! Okay. Tell me what you know. I was brought here to interview a man accused of murder, okay? He lures people in by telling them that they're gonna be on a TV show, in reality, they're snuff films. He really kills the actors. Actors? She's an actress. This man has a killer here, okay? Something like you have never seen. They call him Havoc. Keep talking until I understand. I'll tell you everything you need to know but not here. Okay, because if you have like a SWAT team or something with you, they're gonna kill us both. Can you drive a motorcycle? No. Come with me. (EERIE TEMPO MUSIC) (EXCITING BEAT MUSIC) (MOTOR RUMBLING) (MOTOR REVVING) You know how to drive a car, right? Yeah. Yeah, of course. My cell phone doesn't have reception up here. Take my car and... Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not gonna come with me? I can't. When you're in phone reception, call 911. You want me to go by myself? Tell them there's a detective on site. Give them my badge number. Okay, but wait, why don't you just come with me? I can't leave. Wait, wait. Wait. Because of the girl in the picture? Yes. I told you, I don't even think I saw her. Based on what I observed, she's most likely here. Okay, but you realize if she is here she's being guarded by those men and their machine guns, right? I mean, you're willing to be killed for her? Yes, and I'd kill the whole world to save her. What kind of a cop are you? What is she, your kid or something? (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Shit. I should've known. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hey! Hey! Is that your car? Yeah. Okay. Okay, so when they leave, we run over there then drive the hell outta here, right? Only you. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (DRAMATIC TEMPO MUSIC) Goddamn it, what are they doing? Waiting to see who comes back for the car? Probably. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Hey, look. I'm sorry I gave you a hard time earlier. Okay, I understand she's your daughter. She's really lucky to have a policeman for a father. She never thought so. When was the last time you saw her? It's been over 10 years. What? I haven't even spoken to her. How do you suspect she's even here? My ex-wife reported her missing. I'm a detective. All clues point to here. Well, I hope you find her. She'll be so happy to see you. She hasn't been happy to see me since she was eight. Trust me, if she's in this nightmare, no matter what has happened in your past, she'll be happy to see you. She's probably forgotten me by now.

A few weeks ago she came in, like me. She thought she was going to be on a TV show. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I can't believe it. She said you would come. Where is she?
