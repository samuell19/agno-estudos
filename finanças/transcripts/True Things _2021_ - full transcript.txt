First thing we need to be doing is asking some more probing questions. Working out what kind of support we need to put in place for these customers. And what sort of reasonable adjustments the employees need to be making as well. Second thing we can be doing is spend a little bit less time on our phones. I've noticed that people have been hiding their phones on their lap, on their desk, in their bags. I just need a proof of address. So if you could bring in a bank statement or a gas... But I ain't got it. What do you want me to do? Pull it out of my fucking pocket? Well, we can't do anything until you bring that in. What the fuck is your problem? I'm just saying that we need it in writing. But I'm here. Is there something wrong with your fucking eyesight? We still need it in writing. Fucking ugly bitch. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Kate? Kate. Kate. I just said your name three times, Kate. It's like you're on another bloody planet. Uranus. (CHUCKLES) Sorry. David would like to see you before lunch. - Okay. - You'll get an email. And you were late once again this morning. It was only a few minutes. And where were you Tuesday? I was off sick. You didn't bring a doctor's note. Dog ate it. Just joking. Yeah. I'll bring one in next time. Sorry, it just totally slipped my mind. Do you recall what we discussed last month, Kate? Yes. Right. So this is your final warning before I take the next step. Then whatever happens subsequently is beyond my control. Do you understand? (FLY BUZZING) KATE: Mr Kendrick? Now, is this your permanent address? BLOND: Difficult to say. KATE: Well, you can give us a care-of address, but then you will need to bring in written consent. Just say permanent, then. Okay. So you've just been released from prison. Can I just check that your release date is the 20th of April, 2019? - Is that correct? - Yep. Had a small run-in with an articulated lorry and a lamppost. Can you confirm your marital status? Married or single? Single. Very. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Oh, sorry. Computer's going... Ow. Uh, computer's gone. Um... Right. Okay, so it usually takes about three to five weeks for a claim to be processed. And if you, you know, don't hear from us within that time, you can just contact us via phone or email. Do you have any other questions? What you doing for lunch? KATE: Well... Uh... (BOTH CHUCKLE) (CHUCKLES) Uh... Well, I usually just eat a sandwich in the kitchen. They don't give us very long. Sounds worse than bloody prison. (KATE CHUCKLES) You ought to go out. Sit on a bench. Well, I will keep that in mind, thank you. Right. Well, I'm relying on you, Miss... Perkin... to make it happen. - (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHUCKLES) So, I've set you up on that blind date. His name's Rob. Nice one. Thanks. Yeah, he is, actually. He's really nice. Good looking, too. He really wants to settle down. What's up? Come on. Shit! Shit, I've just remembered something. I promised Gavin I'd sign off on a file by the end of the night. I'll have to nip back. It's Friday bloody night. I know. Just get me a drink and I won't be long, all right? Okay, weirdo. Fancy meeting you here. Fancy meeting you. How was your day? Good, thanks. Yours? Not too bad. - What are you up to? - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Nothing, really. You've got hair in your eyes, darling. BLOND: Where do you usually drink? KATE: Anywhere. God, I can't walk in this skirt! (CHUCKLES) The car's a bit of a mess. It's pretty shameful. I'll tidy up the passenger seat. (CAR LOCK CHIRPS) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Make you wanna jump? KATE: No. - (EXCLAIMS, CHUCKLES) - Do it then! It's a phenomenon, actually. The urge to hurl yourself off high places. - Is it, now? - Yeah. It's not about wanting to kill yourself. It's life-confirming. 'Cause you could do it. But you don't. (WHISTLES) Phew. (CHUCKLES) You're lovely, aren't ya? Take your tights off. (BOTH CHUCKLE) And your knickers. KATE: (GASPS) It's cold, it's cold. BLOND: Stand on my feet. (GASPS SOFTLY) (KATE BREATHING HEAVILY) (GASPS) - You all right, darling? - Ow. Yeah. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Keep going. Keep going.

You look lovely. - I had a date. - Oh. With a very handsome man. (CHUCKLES) Oh, I like a handsome one. I know you do. (CHUCKLES) And he's funny, too. Sounds like you're smitten. Might be. A little bit. Should have brought him here. We've only just met, Nan. - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - And when's the big day? - (DOOR OPENS) - Don't be silly. Lovely girl like you, he's bound to propose. WOMAN: Felicidades. Wedding. Party... (CHUCKLES) KATE: I should get going, Nan. She's a very busy girl. Got a lot on. Yeah, I'll see you soon, okay? You seeing him tonight? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Going somewhere nice? Um... I'm gonna cook him a meal. Good on you. (TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) (LINE RINGING) (CONTINUES RINGING) ALISON: Hello? (IN GRUFF VOICE) What are you wearing? Oh, you have to be quick, Kate. I'm putting the kids to bed. I'm calling to make a formal apology. Yeah, where were you? You could've called me. I know, I know. I know. I'm sorry, but it was, urn... It was a bit mad, actually. Yeah, well, that's the story of your life, innit? I said put that down right now. Don't talk to me to me like that. Pesky kids. Right. Well, that's fine, then. That's fine. If you can give it back to me now... So what are you saying? Are you sorry? Yeah, yeah. Good boy. Good boy. That's it. You mustn't be rude to Mummy. Too tired for this tonight, okay?

We'll see you tomorrow. - Bring a doctor's note. - Yeah. (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) KATE: So where are we going? BLOND: We're eloping. But it's a secret. - (KATE CHUCKLES) - Even from you. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Look over there. It's a bird of prey. Where? - There! - Where? (LAUGHING) I can't see it. BLOND: It's a buzzard. Shit, he's circling us. Shit. (CHUCKLES) Shit! (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) BLOND: You eat like a squirrel. Well, it's totally unmanageable with one hand. How come you're always like this? Like what? Beguiling, aren't you? Don't know. (LIGHTER CLICKING) I think your smoke's blowing into that woman's food. - Is it blowing in your food? - No. Why do you wear those shoes? Horrible, aren't they? (CHUCKLES) Well, there's a dress code, so I kinda have to. BLOND: Bastards. We'll get the bill. I'll show you my favourite spot. Excuse me. Can we get the bill? Thanks, darlin'. No, you're all right. I'll get this. Are you sure? Yep. (BIRDS CHIRPING) KATE: Ouch. - BLOND: All right, darling? - Yes, thank you. Just a bramble. Well brought up, aren't you? I suppose. What'd you call your parents? Mummy and daddy? They're called Trevor and Susan. What do you call yours? - Bitch and cunt. - (LAUGHS) She gave me away when I was four and I never met him. So... So who did you grow up with, then? BLOND: Uh... Various. Coming in for a swim, then? Uh... I'm not very good. Take your clothes off, then. Shy, aren't you? You show me yours and I'll show you mine. This too, please. - Beautiful tits. - Thank you. Very well brought up, indeed. (KATE CHUCKLES) I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about you. My hobbies are reading and listening to music. I like drawing. - Really? - Yeah. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend. Do you do this sort of thing often? Are you interrogating me, Ms Perkin? Have you ever killed anybody? (CHUCKLES) I was only in for four months. You're funny. Am I? You know you are. Right. I'm going in the water. (SPLASHING) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) (FLY BUZZING) (CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY) (BLOND MOANS) (FLIES BUZZING) The lovely Kate Perkin. I wish we could stay like this forever. (BLOND EXHALES DEEPLY) (YAWNING) KATE: Can I have one, too, please? What are you trying to do? Climb inside me? What? Nothing. Sorry. (CHUCKLES) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) I just remembered my car's still at work. (SIGHS) Doesn't matter. I'll get the bus. Do you wanna come in for a coffee or something? BLOND: I've got things to do. KATE: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I have, too, so... I'll call you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER IN DISTANCE) (DOOR OPENS) ALISON: Feeling better, are you? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, just bloody migraines. Got a doctor's note. I hate these shoes. Do you hate these shoes? You know you can get sacked for having a relationship with a claimant, don't you? I mean, I haven't got a problem with it even though I got you the job. I just... I thought you should know. So is it just a fling, or... I don't know. It's early days. Does he want kids? Uh, we've only been on two dates. (CHUCKLES) Don't want him to give you the run-around though, do you? You know what you're like. Well, he seems pretty keen on me, actually. I just know you want to settle down. That's all, babe. I want a lot of things. Like what? Don't know. I'd like to travel. Where to? Loads of places. - Yeah? Like where? - I don't know. I'd just like to take a trip somewhere. Get in a car and drive off. Have an adventure. Nice. Well, it's up to you, isn't it? I just... You need to get your priorities right, that's all. I take it you're still on for babysitting Saturday night? Yeah, yeah, course. Great. See you out there. (MACHINE WHIRRING) (WHIRRING STOPS) (SEAGULLS CALLING IN DISTANCE) (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) SUSAN: And how's work? Yeah, busy. Run off my feet. I bet you are. SUSAN: Did I tell you your cousin Janet's just had her third baby? Be nice if you could drop her a card. KATE: Yeah, sure. Another boy. She'll be exhausted. So, have you been going out? Having fun? What you been up to? Seeing someone, actually. Oh! Well, that's great news, Katie. Well, spill the beans. Tell us more. What's he like? Where did you meet? Well, we just, kind of, bumped into each other at work, and then, you know, that was that. Wham, bam, wham. (TREVOR CHUCKLES) So you've got a lot in common, then? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he's, you know, he's had a tough time lately, but he's doing okay now. He's getting back on his feet. SUSAN: Oh, dear. How do you mean? Well, he hasn't got any legs. (TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) You're joking. Yes, Mum, I'm joking. (TREVOR CHUCKLING SOFTLY) You've got a very dark sense of humour sometimes. - Come on, Susan. - He's fine. I'm fine. Don't worry about it. SUSAN: I do worry about it, though. That's the thing. I should get going. A lot on. Don't let me forget to give you some vegetables before you go, love. No, I'm all right for veg. Thanks, Dad. TREVOR: Got some fantastic tomatoes. Looks like it's gonna rain again. SUSAN: Mmm.

ROB: The thing is, if I was gonna take on extra work, it'd have to be for, like 10K more. Otherwise, it just wasn't worth my while. So when I was head-hunted and when the price was right, I just thought, "Yeah. Leave Sheffield. Why not?" So, here I am. (CHUCKLES) And how do you like it? So far, so good, yeah. Yeah, it's quite picturesque, isn't it? - Surprisingly so. - Yeah. Well, maybe I can take you on a tour sometime. I'd like that. Show you the beauty spots. Yeah, I'd really like that. I like your shoes, by the way. Oh, thanks, yeah. You know, I've been told that shoes are very important. That's right. So, uh. What about you? I've been doing all the talking. How's your work? Do you enjoy it? Well, if you get me another gin and tonic, I will tell you all about it. Okay, deal. (CHUCKLES) Not for me, though. I'm driving. Oh. I got a taxi, you know, just in case.

I always know what I'm talking about. That's it. There you go. That's better. What's wrong, my darling? No one likes me. What are you talking about? My friends. (CRYING) That's their fucking problem, then. How? How can it be? They're not your tribe. You need to find your tribe. You're my tribe. What, just me? Yeah. Small tribe. Tiny tribe.

What kind of meeting? Possible business venture. Early days. Can I come? Are you joking? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. I still feel a bit high. Can I borrow your car? Did I tell you mine was fucked? Um, yeah. Yeah, you did. It's something with the exhaust. I need to take it to a garage. But one that's not gonna rip me off. Is this all you eat? You really are a little squirrel. Right. Better get going. Better get on. Look, I can go and buy you some bacon and eggs. It will only take a minute. Pushy, aren't you? All right. Go on then if you're going. (KEYS RATTLE) Get me some coffee.

ALISON: He's been fucking you about, hasn't he? Taking your car is basically theft. I said he could take it. He's using you, mate. No, it's not like that. It's pretty obvious, Kate. No, look, he hasn't had a very good childhood. Ah. (CHUCKLES) So you're gonna rescue him, are you? (CHUCKLES) No. We have a connection. Okay. You need to text him and tell him that if he doesn't bring your car back by tonight then you're calling the police. Sometimes I think you enjoy all this. Sorry? I beg your pardon, enjoy what exactly? Do you actually think that I don't have anything better to do than listen to you moan about your latest shag? You seem smug. You seem like a bit of a slag.

Well, that, um... you know, potential business venture? Did they give you the job, Mr Kendrick? Do I look like someone who can work for other people? No. This beer tastes off. KATE: Oh, no. Brought your keys. (BLOND SIGHS) I thought you might have called. I've been busy. You just disappeared. What? When? When I went to the supermarket. I left you a note. Yeah, I know, but I thought you might have just, you know, called just to say, I don't know, just to say... It's a two-way street, Kate. You could have called me. I did. Oh, yeah. I mean, you've had my car for over a week. You lent it to me. (SIGHS) Look, I'm just wondering what's... what's going on with us? Seriously, you wanna do this now? The thing is, I like you. I like you a lot. And I would... In fact, I think you're pretty great. And I would like to carry on, you know, carry on seeing you. What are you talking about? Well, I just... You know, I'd like to be your girlfriend. (CHUCKLES) How old are you? 12? Uh... (HESITATING) What do you want then? Don't want anything. You... You said I was your soul mate. When did I say that? After the party. When I was pissed and high on pills? Yeah, I said... I said you were high. I said that. I was trying to calm you, Kate. Placate you. You were a mess. You invited me to your sister's wedding. What does that mean? Shit. It's a friend. An old mate... He's in town for a night. I'll have to go. KATE: What, right now? BLOND: He's like the closest thing I have to a brother. Okay? What's wrong? I think, I think I've got a migraine. (BREATHES DEEPLY) I've got to meet my mate, okay? Your car's parked on the other side of the road. Wait, wait. How, how are we leaving it then? You're too fucking much, you know that? No, I don't, I don't understand. - What? - I don't understand.

She's all on her own. - TREVOR: Sit down. - I don't wanna sit down. Look, your mother has brought some chicken and chocolate cake, your favourite. And I've brought you some veg from the garden. Lovely fresh peas... I don't want any more fucking veg. What are you doing here? Why are you in my flat? Just get out. Get out. Get out. Get out! Get out. Don't know what's wrong with you.

So today I'm going to be showing you how to create a perfect cream cheese frosting for your cake. So I'm going to add in, first of all, the softened butter. And then I'm adding in the cream cheese. Now, if anybody has tried to do this by hand, you'll know it is actually really difficult - to remove all of the lumps. - (MOBILE PHONE BUZZING) So we're taking out all of that stress by using this stand mixer. So this is the attachment that we're going to use and it really gently slots in there like that. Turn it on, you'll be able to hear the slow start motor. So it's really nice and quiet, so you don't have all that noise in the kitchen while you're doing it. And you can hear how quiet that motor really is. It's the perfect... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING) So you can add a dash of vanilla, if you fancy a bit of extra flavour, or you can leave it as it is. So we are gonna be adding a bit of sugar to this now to sweeten the mix. - And this goes perfectly... - (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) (CONTINUES RINGING) (RINGING STOPS) (SIGHS) (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Um, just arrived and I'm just outside the main exit.
