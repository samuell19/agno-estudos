She says that we have tied up her feet and we are obliged to cut them. Does she accept to eat ? This morning she asked for milk and broth. This is all she wants. There is no reason to give her anything else. She has taken her laxative without difficulty. With me she is very soft. However, she hit and insulted a nurse. Villemer ? There is an emergency in Saint- Anne... Can you see a patient of mine ? He is an industrialist. He hid a camera in his cane and followed unknown women in the streets. And took their photos from under their skirts. He was captured yesterday. at Saint- Lazare. You can excuse me. We will see each other tomorrow. Who is she ?

She says that this is not the color for her. - Thank you, Cécile. Anything else ? - Yes ... Today, your mother called twice. Thank you. Hurry up, otherwise you will miss your train. See you tomorrow. Do you remember Madame D'Aragon? She came this morning. Guess what did she say ? "Congratulations! We saw your son in the newspaper" "My son?" He is nominated as surgeon general. Congratulations ! I am sorry... I asked Cécile... Yes, Cécile... Gabriel, will you live alone again ? In a family like ours ... For the memory of your father ... Promise me . I have fever. Your pulse is almost normal. Who would have guessed ? - What ? - that you would be to my side ... How many nights did I remain awake for you ? At times, you spoke in sleep. You said strange but beautiful things. I remember once ... Among everybody else, you are the one who gave me the most worry .. But gave me the best joy. Excuse me, I will come back. God ! To cure, my husband bought me a lot of silk It did not help, because if you give me the ... Ruins my pleasure. Did you try to stop ? I cannot help it ... I don't think of anything else .. I pushed ... Continue. I am fed up. I cannot say anymore. We have not finished. What do you want ? To help you. - Help me with what ? - to not to go the asylum. Why am I sent here instead of being in the prison ? Do you want to go to the prison and be responsible of your actions ? Yes. I want that. After many sentences, you can be relegated to life imprisonment So much the better .. So I would not have temptations Talk to me about your first theft. How old were you ? I don't remember ... Try to remember. It happened a long time ago ... Before your marriage ? No, no, it was later I was 17 years old Were you already a seamstress ? Yes, even at home I had everything which I wanted How did it happen ? I was in a big shop, I wanted to buy ribbons. Then I saw the dress ... It was blue. But an electric blue. It was as if the dress looked at me I stood there. Then ? I walked towards the clothes I took it against me ... I lifted my skirt. And you rubbed it against yourself I don't remember ... I think so ... I have forgotten. I am thirsty. Can I have water ? Yes This ? No. Can you follow me ? We have just received a magnificent Turquoise. May be a mallow ? We have a great selection ... Cyclamen... Lavender .. Lilac ... With our catalogue it will be more simple ... We can get exactly the same color which you would like. If you would like to look ..... Excuse me, miss. - What is this color ? - Prussian blue. - Does it not have any other name ? - No... I don't believe so. Is it not what we call ... Electric blue ? The electric blue is much more dazzling. Look, here it is. Do you have a scarf of this colour ? Certainly. Here it is. Virgin silk Excuse me. This is virgin silk from Japan. Ah, that is you, doctor. Good Evening. Leave it, I will put it out later. Good night doctor. Do you remember the first time when you fondled yourself ? Reply please. I was eleven years old. Twelve. How did it happen ? I was alone in my room ... seated on a chair. But I was not seated as usual but I squatted The chair was covered with velvet. Velvet, not by silk ? No, the silk came later You were naked ? Yes ... I liked it ... so much that I started again. I never felt like it. Even with your lovers ? No, however there was one whom I liked a lot. At times... At times ... - He gave you pleasure. - Yes. This pleasure was strong ? Less strong when you would fondle yourself ? Yes, much less. When you stole the silk, you said that you needed to crumple it .. Why ? When I crumpled, I felt it better. I felt its cry which increased my pleasure. Please try to describe. What ? To describe what you felt at that time when you stole . I don't have words ... It is like I stole little bit of sky. A little bit of sky ? Yes. It is the silk, but I don't know why. At first I would crumple it .. Without damaging it, without ruining it .... Never against me. Later I could not breath ... I have ... It is like a wave which knocks me down ... I was drunk ... I could not control. I trembled. But no fear, no... Pleasure ... I never thought that I was doing anything wrong. Later I put myself in a corner ... To touch the silk, to handle it. This is how I found …. Unless I lost the knowledge. Isn't it hot, no ? Do you want to see a little bit of sky ? Thank you. This is not what I wanted to say. I was speaking about it. Take, this is for you. Why do you do that ? - I am not a curiosity. - I know . Why do you treat me like this ? If I do anything wrong, you have to punish me and put me in prison. We just try to cure people. but I am responsible ! I don't want to be sent to asylum ! Other women are punished. They told the judge and also Dr.Bailly that I will be sentenced. Here it is me who decides. You decide but you don't listen. What do I do since three days ? Finally, you will do like other people. Still I believed ... What ? I thought that you... You could understand ..understand the silk. You never spoke to anybody ? Enter ! Excuse me Villmer Can I see you for a moment ? When you fondled yourself, did you think of anything in particular ? - You don't dream about it ? - How ? Were you able to think about a man ? No, never. Never ? No. I think only of my pleasure. It is as if the men did not exist. GERMANY DECLARES WAR ON FRANCE This time we will not escape MARIE SILK You think that I didn't see you? Is that all ? They can put in isolation for 15 days. And you don't know how to write. Whereas she masturbates with the fetish It represents splendid scenes .. Strangely, our patient does not confirm anything of it. THE FETISHISM WITH FABRIC OF A PATIENT Should we really believe her ... You need something, Cécile? No sir, nothing ... Please come. Enter. Would you like to do other things here ? I don't know. Other things for me ... Besides what you do for me. That depends ... For example, help me in my work. I have the impression that it does not leave you indifferent. Please don't blush ... there is no harm. On the contrary ... I was wondering if this interest .. Can be expressed in a more concreate manner. I am not sure of having understood ... Your vision, your feminine sensibility Could be very useful for me. Useful ? Could you give me your opinion about this ? . This is an article about Fortuny, the famous dress designer. Do you know him? He has designed these clothes. Aren't they wonderful ? This is a "yes" which wishes to say "no"? No, they are beautiful. It is only that ... I didn't know that it would interest you. It is not common See these pleats, these fabrics ... Each design is different. See the motives, The contours. it is extraordinary ! Any woman would dream of wearing a dress like that, wouldn't she ? Yes. What do you expect from me ? That you search ... No, that you select some photos In these magazines. I don't have time. But I have never done this work. I am sure that you will do it fine. Thank you. - You don't want ? - Yes ... See you tomorrow. Wait, the article. It is not necessary. I know it already. This morning while cleaning by chance I read first lines. I could not help but continued to read. It talked of fabric with strong words. With so much passion, as if they were alive. I would say that you loved them as if ... How ? They were women. May be better than women. Excuse me. As if the men did not exist This is the expression which you have used ? Yes... Can you speak louder. These men cannot hear you. I said yes. Should we deduce that you don't like men ? No. Did you feel any attraction for a person of your sex ? Reply. No, never . I didn't hear anything. No, never We are obliged to believe you. Gentlemen. Mrs Benjamin, thank you. Sister Camille! The patient. The patient whom you just heard is not an ordinary fetishist. You would not have failed to note a certain number of particularities. which are not part of the visual drawing of the perversion of fetishism. - Damn! - Sorry ? Sit down. Somebody would come looking for you. What for ? Nobody told you ? you will be taken back to prison in Fresnes. The van will come any time - How can that be ? - Didn't you want it ? The doctor didn't tell me anything. He asked for your transfer. ...or a physiological odor in particular... ...qualities required for fetishism. Were not searched in the fabric. We know that a notable trait of fetishism Dr Villemer leaves for war tomorrow. In today's case the patient affirms that the fabric is never a substitute for the man's body. She says that the silk is not associated with anybody It acts on its own qualities : Its texture, its brightness, its cry. We should believe her when she says that she masturbates with the silk, not without fantasies ...... as a gourmet appreciates an exquisite odor ? Doctor! Doctor! come fast ! somebody has fainted ! - Sister, water. - let us go for it . - What happened ? - She collapsed suddenly. Make room! Lean here. Please don't be afraid. For all these reasons I would be grateful to you. To oppose all procedures of hospitalization in an asylum. And to allow the patient to finish her sentence in prison. Shall I put your camera in the suitcase ? Yes, thank you. Cécile Please keep this manuscript until my return. These are the first pages I could not go further Don't talk to anybody not even to my publisher. This letter is for Dr. Garnier. It is very urgent. Give it to him personally. I wanted to do it myself But the taxi would be here soon. I prefer cold to boredom. Shall I kiss you ? Yes, of course. See you soon. Be careful ...and don't leave us without news. Hello doctor... No, he has just left. He will take the ship to Morocco tomorrow to join general Lyautey. He didn't see that he would leave for war. His suitcase seemed as if it was packed for a long journey, Like somebody who is absolutely sure of coming back Gust ... Battle ... Combat . Death. Captain, shall we continue ? Sugar ... Sky ... Mosaic ... Terrace ... Line ... Savannah .. - over there ! - No I don't see anything. and well ? May be Leila... or Yasmina... When she tears the silk it is not for a sadistic violence ... But with the aim of feeling it better ... and to understand it better. How are you doing ? Sea …. Iron ….. Earth ... No, with two "R". Earth! It is better to remain silent when we don't know. Guess what is my boyfriend's name ... Pierre! May be he is dead. It appears that he is in a butcher's shop We forgot "war ". For once, we must forget it. Isn't it strange not to love ? No. Liar ! At times, at night I bite myself in order not to cry. Hold it ! Move a bit. There ! I have decided : it will be half moon and the star. yes, this is exact. And the inscription ? Here it is.

This is a roman tunic. These are the clothes which the women of the antiquity used to wear I would like to show the students that for Greeks, Romans and Arabs the manner of dressing was very important. See these folds, these contours ... they surely have a meaning and they can speak to us. Why do you need me ? You wear these clothes and walk ... walk among the students ... As a living sculpture. - Aude! - I am coming. Wait. Take my card. I am here on Thursday at the same time. And who is going to pay ? I will pay and I will pay you double tariff. You go to the attic.

So true, so intimate I am proud of it I would never have learned to write.

A dizziness ... which I got from Africa... Unless ... That is you . - may be see your tomorrow ...? - may be ... - Who is it ? - A new teacher ... I think that he started to work in September I have never seen so many people. - Do you know who he is ? - Gabriel... Gabriel de Villemer. You will have remarked that the Greeks did not leave stripes on their clothes. As the stripes were cut, In one way or another it was needed to, fix the material in order to avoid that it got frayed. The simplest form is the hem [garment finishing method]. In his history of dressing of antiquity Heuzey denied formally that the Greeks could have used the hem . Let us say for aesthetic reasons Thank you Miss. You can leave. However, the examination of some statues from the Louvre museum show us a trait in these clothes which being parallel to the edge cannot be more than the hem More specifically, it is about a plain hem. There is no doubt about this subject. I thank you. See you next Thursday You see, we do almost the same work ? I never imagined that you would talk about hem in fine arts. - Did you like it ? - Yes. I regret that I did not come before. Thank you, Aude. You have been perfect. Thank you, see you on Thursday. Let us go out, would you like ? I will join you. - Did you read it ? - I never read novels. How sad it is ! How was it ? When I rethink, I only think blue and ....white . Blue as the sky and white as the walls, This mosque. These women. Is it true that they never show their faces ? Ah, no, never. No, no, no. Once, I saw some women in the desert near a stream of water. They were washing their clothes, with uncovered faces When they saw me, they left everything to cover it Two of them even lifted their skirts to cover their faces Only, underneath, they were completely nude ... Did you know many women ? Yes, some. Were they beautiful ? yes, especially one woman. - What is her name ? - Aicha. Do you still like her ? It is you who is now asking questions ... I don't know ... It was another life ... And you ... after having come out of prison, You would have known some men. Men do not interest me. - Even now ? - Even now. Over there. This is incredible. The wagon passed from other, I am quite sure. There was an old man who walked under the trees. suddenly, he stopped ... and saw his hands. A man who saw his hands under the sun, is the last image I carried from the prison ... It is thanks to you that I learned to write. It is true that I was sure that one day I would see you. But I was afraid of not finding the words For this reason I wanted to write to you. Once I got the worst of all punishments When I was banned from correspondence. The food, the cold, this yellow light day and night. But when you cannot write, receive letters ... . You cannot know. In comparison, hell is sweet. - Come ? - Yes, I am coming ! Wait ! - Are you hurt ? - No, no, nothing happened. - What happened ? - I believe that I have torn my suit. I will fix it for you, I have all that is needed. Marie, will you teach me to sew ? Are you serious ? Come ... I would like to show something to you. Come, come. You can see now. You would like ? - What are you searching ? - Linen. The linen is over there. - Beautiful, no? - It is Beautiful! Very Beautiful. No, this is taffeta... and the Marceline. - Ah, and this one ? - Shantung. And this one? Falla. And this one ? Silk. Here is the linen. Ah, That is exact. What length do you need ? Six meters. Miss, can we have six meters ? - Yes, Madam. Thank you. - I will help you. Be careful. Before cutting it needs to be washed... Good evening Madam. Good evening, doctor. You saw that woman ? She is the director of a religious school in the island of Saint- Louis. And you would never imagine what madam asks her husband each night : to beat her. Simply ! and to whip her vigorously ! And does he do that ? and how ! Here you are madam, the cash counter is here. I have to see something in second floor. See you down ? In front of the main entrance ? Madam! Good evening Sir. Good evening. Will you have this dress in 36? Ah. We don't have here, but I can go check in the warehouse. Would you wait ? Excuse me! Excuse me! Ah, this is sufficient. It is late, I have to go back. Why don't you stay ? The house is big ... There is a room for you. No, I did not bring my things ... We will get them tomorrow. If you want. Stay. Why don't you try to sew ? - let's go ! - No. Like that ? Hmm, this is nice. Careful. See, you don't need me. Careful, no, Near the edge. Very small points. Are you alright ? This is nothing. I am a little tired ... I will make some tea. Marie! This fold looks good, doesn't it ? Did I wake you up ? No, I did not sleep. I am going, I cannot sleep here. May be later ... Tonight I will wait for you, You will come ? Yes. Excuse me Madam... Do you know Marie Benjamin? Yes, but we don't work together. Do you see the woman in the hat ? - Ask her. - Thank you. Excuse me Madam. Do you work with Marie Benjamin? - Do you know where she is ? - No. You will not find her ... She has been arrested. We don't have any news about her since two days. The boss told us that she has been arrested for theft There is nothing to be done. Nothing authorizes me to oblige a detainee to come if she refuses. Did she give any reason ? Not to my knowledge. If she changes her mind Would you let me know ? Of course If you allow me, doctor I don't understand. If you wish to see this person, nothing obliges you Just have to go there ... You can talk to her as her psychiatrist ... You can say something to Mr.Castagnet, who is the incharge It is not in this manner that I want to see her. Besides, all this is of no importance. - May I ask you a favor ? - of course. Please give her the permission to write as much as she wants ... I think that for her it is the only thing which matters ... Get up princess, there is a surprise for you ! What is that ? Look. This prison is like other prisons ... This is the fifth time I am in prison. And I pray with all my forces that it would be last. I suffer for being far from you, but I think that it is better like this. I cannot love you as you want. I am too afraid of spoiling what exists between us ... If everything goes well with our messenger, you will get this letter tomorrow. In spite of all the obstacles, I will write to you every day. If I could do like this each day, the life here for me would seem almost soft ... With love. Marie. Even though it costs me ... I respect your decision of not seeing each other ... He does not receive anybody and I will not make any exceptions. - Just a moment. - No, sorry. Good, then tell him that very soon I hope to receive his news. Fine, Miss. I would like to know ... if he would give classes again ? I fear not in the next few months. Excuse me for asking but ... the doctor has always been very generous with me ... If you could speak to him then may be he can help me, While waiting I restart my work with him ... You can count on me. Good bye. Yes ? The person you were waiting has just come. I gave her your message Do you still need me ? I would like to finish the day's work with you. You have not sopped since morning. You should take some rest. I don't know anything else. One asks vineyard to give only wine Please close the shutters. From today, you will draft my letters. All your letters ? No, the one related to the work. I have to concentrate all my forces on my book ... Ah, specifically, write to my publisher. Tell him that my manuscript will be ready not before two months. That he stops to hassle. However I would never love anybody else. You would like to believe that there is no love between us. However, I would never love anybody else. You are mad, you have read this hundred times ... No. I am not mad. You would like to believe that there is no love between us. However I would never love anybody else. Gabriel, Since last six months I count Your letters as ... I count the days. Warmly Marie. Your car is waiting for you. This evening, I will come to pick you up. Do you smell ? How soft is the air this evening. This reminds me of some nights in Fez... The odor of oranges and eucalyptus You would say that the air tonight is full of a powder of light. It is here that I believe we split. - Good night, Cecile. - No, today I accompany you. Excuse me, I would like to return alone. See you tomorrow. - Más lento... - Excuse me? Slowly. Dress yourself, the session is over. Finished ! Did you hear me ? Finished. This is not sufficient.

Are you possessed by the demon of obedience or that of the curiosity ? I have lot of curiosity for your work and only your work . Your private life, believe me, does not interest me. Excuse me,Cécile. I spent a very bad night. I didn't want to hurt you. And your book ? You don't talk any more about it ... - No. I don't want to think anymore of it .. - Why ? I fear I would not be able to go until the end. You must continue, you cannot leave it. I thank you, Cécile. I cannot do any more. I feel pity. The slight search takes hours ... Finding a paper among other papers has become an insurmountable task. I can help you. About what ? I don't have any more energy, concentration. Why don't we try a dictation ? No, Cécile. It is not possible. Let me deal with a dictation. Don't insist, Cécile. please do it for me! - For you ? - Yes, for me ! We can work in the night, the silence helps you a lot. At night, the words come easily. I am at your service, at any time, if you like ... From tonight, I will sleep here. ...or any other tension As you want. Please read last two paragraphs. The patient abandoned all sexual relations with the man. During masturbation, it is the image of the silk which appears in her mind and not of the man. It is only the silk which acts as an auxiliary. She exceeds in her pleasure and replaces the man. Continue We have remarked almost twice that our patient ... did not want rolls but completely finished dresses It seems that the silk achieves in a dress the highest quality desired by the patient Her rigidity. In fact, the silk should not touch the skin softly but still that ... No, no, no. please correct Instead of "touch" put... "caress". Caress the skin delicately The silk must not only ... caress ... the skin delicately , It is necessary that it has a body. While the man wants a fabric to have a set of female characteristics The fetishist woman searches in silk, apart from its softness,a sort of ... Internal energy which evokes the muscle Or any other firmness as she wants . Very good. Still two or three nights like this and we will see the end ... I am sure. I am sure Are you not going to sleep ? No yet. Take rest Good night. - Cécile. - yes If you have questions I prefer that you ask them No, no, I don't have questions. Oh come on, I can feel them, I can almost hear them. I assure you that you are wrong. For example you can example me if There is not some readiness to oblige in these descriptions For this strange mania. I am not so stupid. This is a question which I even asked myself. If you wish to know, I like very much what you wrote. I find that this is a ...magnificent portrait. Thank you. I didn't want to offend you. It is magnificent, but this woman is driving you crazy. I warn you that I am not going to get her letters. They are causing you too much harm. Would you do me a favor ? Yes, of course. Please read me this letter. I don't have the correct glasses.

Everybody is sleeping at the hotel. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Is there sun ? Yes, the road is deserted. It is very hot. - And the sky ? - Blue. Blue. What kind of blue? The sky has so many manners of being blue. Pure, without clouds. I had crazy dreams. I didn't remember anything. Did I speak ? If I have spoken, please tell me. Where are you ? Here !

Marie, do you write this letter to me or not ? Then ... what do you want to tell him ? My love, my dear My rat. My rat ? For this woman, the silk substitutes the man. It exceeds her, it definitely excludes her. Excuse me. I don't understand the radical change of your point of view. You have always affirmed that the fetishist woman has an ornament of the mind as an object of her obsession and we cannot allow ourselves to be deceived by this woman's protests. and that her case was nothing more than a secret and shameful form of fetishism. From your voice, I would say that you are young. therefore, impatient. I was like you. But it is a reality. We have to accept, even though it offends the idea, which we have of our profession that this woman does not need men. This woman only wants silk. And as far as I know, the man is neither of wood nor silk, Gentlemen, a last question ? Doctor Solano! I would like to ask Doctor Villemer what his future projects are ? For the moment, I have only three projects. Walk in Piazza Navona, sit in the sun, and drink a good white wine. At least one. Thank you, professor, Thank you. Please, calm yourself. Stop, please. Please, please, come. Fast Cécile, Fast! I am here, I am here. Take a pen, take a pen,fast. Please take a pen Cécile. Write. I promise that we will do it tomorrow. I have to write it immediately !

I need her, I need her. Get her out immediately. Get her out! Write : Dear state prosecutor She is innocent ! She is innocent ! A telegram from your publisher. The proofs are ready. Can we can go tomorrow ? I don't like this. When one of my books is printed, I prefer to forget it. Turn the page. Reread, It forces me to remember what has finished. How can you say that ? I am empty now, It is the only state which suits me. - Is there still some coffee ? - Yes. - In the night, you... - No, please, Cécile. Let us forget all that. Besides, you should not be delayed. If you want breakfast. You are right. You don't need anything ? No, Thank you. If you have any doubt for correction, call me. See you soon. You don't need me. you are free !
