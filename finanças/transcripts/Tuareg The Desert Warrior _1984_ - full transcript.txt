TUAREG Based on the novel "Tuareg" by Alberto Vazquez Figueroa The desert reclaims the desert zone. The sands of its dunes cover entire nations, cities, oasis, men and camels. Only once, did a "great caravan" dare to defy the desert, crossing the "empty lands" of Tikdabra. Lying in wait for the caravan were thieves and cutthroats. They committed a grave error, because waiting for them were the courageous Tuareg warriors, who were acting as guides. Yes, the warriors of the people of the veil overcame the Bedouin thieves. It has been said that including merchants, slaves and warriors, there were more than a thousand men in the caravan and an untold number of camels, bearing ivory, gold and precious stones. None of them survived. Not even the Tuareg guides who were the best in the desert. The "great caravan" was devoured by the "empty lands". Since then, no one has entered Tikdabra. You're mistaken. My husband, Gazel Sayah, son of the wind, was in the "empty lands". And before him, his father and his father's father. I, Omar Tamin, can only tell what I've heard from the mouths of many truthful men. And it is this, no one has ever returned from the "empty lands". My wife speaks the truth. I have journeyed in the "empty lands" not once, but twice. Why did you do it? I was not searching for the "great caravan". The first time, I was very young, and only wanted to show that I was worthy of the name Tuareg. The second was when I wanted to see if I were still honorable to myself. I would not like to return. What is the sea? They say it is like a desert of water. And it can fascinate, and it can kill. Is it as beautiful as they say? No more beautiful than the eyes of Laila. Thank you, for everything you've given me. I have given you very little. More than I deserve. You gave me all the love, the respect and the peace that I need. And something that's worth more. The pride of knowing that you're my master. The master of my soul, my thoughts and desires. Thank you, Gazel Sayah. Thank you for having chosen me. No! You do not drink! You must save the water. I must be inflexible with you. Because the desert is inflexible with us, the Tuareg. But it also respects us. Because it knows that we can overcome it. Out there any man may die of thirst. But not a Tuareg. A Tuareg can become a stone. Toughest of all desert plants. Stones do not need to breathe, to think, Do not need a heart or blood. A Tuareg can order his own heart to stop beating. Or his blood to stop flowing. While he dreams of beautiful things. His loved ones, a well brimming over with water, a fleet-footed mehari... This is what keeps his soul and spirit strong. Now, drink if you must. I can resist, father, until tonight. Amed! Amed! No, mistress. Let him fight. Get up. Two men are coming. Water! I am sorry if I frightened you. I wish to thank you. What is your name? Gazel Sayah. A Tuareg of the people of the veil. These are my territories. - And now you are my guests. - Are we close to the frontier? Frontier? What frontier? The deserd has no frontier. The French do not need them since they control the entire Sahara. The French? The French left many years ago. Now we have our independence. The desert is made up of free nations. - Don't you know that? - No, I did not know. Nor did I know about your frontiers. Who can draw a frontier in the desert? Who can stop men from crossing it? Soldiers. Here soldiers are swallowed up by the sands. Who is he? An old sage, I think. I met him on a trip. We were travelling to Daizdabel, when our truck broke down. You are lying. Daizdabel is far from here. Too far. Whoever you are, you are my guests. The slaves are uneasy, father. They say your guests bring danger. Danger for whom? For everyone. They have no names, or faces, like the devils of South. Remember one thing, Amed, hospitality is the first commandment of a Tuareg. Master! Master! Master! Soldiers! Soldiers are coming! As-salamu alaykum, Gazel. Alaykum salam, Mubarrak. We are searching for two men. They are here. You'll have to turn them over to the captain. - They are my guests. - That's enough! - Bring those men here. - Do you not listen!? They are my guests. Hospitality is sacred among us. It's a law older than the Koran. I am the law here. No other exists. Our tradition is one thousand years old. Who are you to question it? Leave my guests in peace. Father! Father! They have Amed! Master! Captain! You want me to blow his head off? They are here, captain! Pigs! You murderer! All right men! Let's go! No one could stop those men. You did all you could. Not enough. I am obliged to follow them. That is the law of a Tuareg. An insult must always be avenged. You have always mistrusted what comes from the other side of the desert. Like you, I feel the spirits of the sands. The gri-gri of misfortune. Three times I have heard them. When my father died, when I was in the "empty lands" of Tikdabra and now. If I do not return, Amed, remember me as you see me now. As a Tuareg who is faithful to his friends and justice. Come back to us. Brake camp. Take my family far from here. To the Guelta Huaila. It will be as you say, master. You were restless all night. It's the waiting, Aisha. I know Gazel will come to settle our account. I am afraid this will unleash a war between the families, as in the past. Tell him you were doing what you had to do. That is also a Tuareg's duty. He will never understand. - Maybe he might not come. - He will come. Mubarrak! As-salamu alaykum. You cover your face, because you no longer consider me a Tuareg. - Why did you do it? - The captain ordered me to. I am an army guide, I could not refuse. A Tuareg can always refuse. Do you no longer respect your own customs? Times change, laws change. The desert never changes, it is always the same. Did those who came with you have no honor? - Where are they from? - The Adoras army camp. Lord, you are omnipotent. Strongest and most just. Nothing in heaven or on earth can happen without you willing it. Help your poor servant Gazel. You who are strong, you who are great. You who are merciful. Where is that son of a bitch? I'll bet a week's pay he'll kill him. I'm betting on the big man too. Hey, sergeant! You, take your water and clear out. - Water has no owner in the desert. - Shut up. You nomads are all troublemakers. Sergeant! Here I go, captain. Look out. If the captain had his way, you guys would be gutted. Get your water and get out! Yes, sir? Did you kick that filthy Tuareg out? Yes, sir. - Why were the men fighting? - Kafir, the one who is dead, stole a package of cigarettes from the big man. You aren't soldiers. You're rapists, murderers, scum of the earth. Maybe you're right, sir. You want me to file a report? Just look through his things, and bring me anything of value. Send his papers to his family. If he's got any, that is. Yes, sir. Come on! Move it! Get him out of here before the flies eat us alive. Corporal! Empty his blanket. Bring me what you find. If you shout, I will cut your throat. Do you understand? Why did you kill my guest? Those were my orders. The young one was to die, but not the other. The old man, who is he? Abdul-el-Kebir. Don't you know who he is? He's a murderer. That's why the government has put a prize on his head. And you are risking your life for him! He was my guest. But... a murderer... all the same. Only I have the right to judge that. - Where is he now? - I don't know. Where is he? Gerifies fort. The commander came to take him there. Gerifies. Don't go. You are risking your life! They'll kill you. They'll kill you and your family. He's a murderer. You are the murderer. They killed the captain! That Tuareg, sergeant. I saw him running out of here like a rabbit. Of course it was a Tuareg, idiot. He almost killed me too. Bashir, bring some disinfectant and bandages! The sergeant's wounded! Corporal, I want the men in combat uniform. Ready in 10 minutes. Food and water for a week. Outfit three jeeps. Move it, your bastards! Move it! Amed, Said, Mussad! You heard the sergeant! - Where are we going, sir? - There! I know you are there, you son of a desert fox! I'll get you! In the gorge! Step up! Get away, Tuareg! I'm gonna serve up your guts to the crows. You hear me! I'll kill you just as my name is Malik! I'll kill you! Let's go! Let's go! If we hurry we can shrink him run and cut him off! You'll pay for this! You'll pay for this! You goddamn son of a bloody camel! And now what are we gonna do? We can't get back this way. No use my asking if you got that Tuareg, sergeant. - But you see, commander Razman... - Forget it! Tell me some other time how you managed to get yourself trapped in the only bottleneck in a 100 miles of desert. - Sergeant Arjinuk! - Yes, sir? - Alert the other patrols, ours and sergeant Malik's. - Yes, sir. We'll continue the search together. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir? You entered my zone without informing me. And you didn't even alert me to what happened in Adoras. - You see, sir, I wanted... - I know exactly what you wanted. The credit for capturing the Tuareg all by yourself. But unluckily, or luckily for you, general headquarters happend to sent messages to me to pass on to all garrisons in the area. I radioed your post and found out everything. Sir, is that Tuareg so damned important? No. But the guest you took away from him is. Who is he, sir? You mean you really don't know, sergeant? Naturally not. They didn't trust you enough to tell you the sort of a dirty work they were having you do. That man is the Ex-President Abdul-el-Kebir. If he had escaped, we'd have a government in exile right now. Do you have any idea what's at stake here? That Tuareg won't rest until he frees him. You don't look very happy about this manhunt, sir. I'd rather catch him myself than have that pig of a sergeant kill him. That Tuareg deserves more respect, doesn't he, sir? Yes, sergeant. He did what was right according to his laws. Sergeant Malik, he's heading for the Salt Lake. You cover the north end and pick him up if he gets across. I'll take care of this side. You see that, sir? Our jeeps would sink right down into that. We'll continue on foot. On foot, sir? You'll pick us off one by one before we get anywhere near him. We cut off all points of access. Thirst will make him give himself up before long. He will never give up. My duty is to try. Get the white flag ready. You really think he'll let you get near him, sir? If he's like they say... yes. I'm opposite you on the other side of the lake. Have you seen the Tuareg? Over. Yeah, I can see him. Stay there. We'll outweigh him. Over and out. Receive. Over and out. Shit. You heard him. We got to stay here and rot, so he won't escape this way. Commander Razman's a real horse's ass. Sergeant! What's the commander doing? Has the commander arrived yet? Almost. He's only got about another half hour to go. As-salam alaykum. Do you have some water? I do. But it is for me. You will drink when you return. You're right. I should have come better prepared. I didn't realise the incredible difference in temperature. It's an oven out here. Have you come to speak of the weather? No. I've came to ask you to give yourself up. You'll have a just trial. No one needs judge my actions. Hospitality is the first law of a desert. They are the ones who'd broken it, not I. But they are the government. Don't you understand? I do not understand the government that breaks the law. And it wants to punish me for it. - It is stupid. - Yes. Maybe... stupid and absurd... But it's my duty... to prevent more bloodshed. Think about it. Don't force me to kill you. Do you really believe you could do it? Rest a little, commander, I'll take over. What do you say, sergeant? You think we could get close enough to see what's happening? If he's still alive, he'll see us even in the dark. They say Gazel never misses with his rifle. It's suicide. I never thought a Tuareg was capable of commiting a suicide. He's dead. He must be dead! It's been three days since he's moved. I know he doesn't have any water. I saw he didn't. I'm sorry, R'Orab. I do not want to lose you, my friend. But I have no other choice. We're gonna waste another night waiting around for that dumb picker? I'm used to killing Bedouins, not waiting around all night watching them. Commander, commander, can you read me? Over. Yes, sergeant. I read you. Over. Have you seen the vultures? Either the Tuareg or the camel has died. Right. We'll have to know which one. Are we gonna wait here all our lives? No, sergeant. Let's go on after him. Over and out. Do not move! I do not want to kill anyone. Now take off your clothes! Do what he says. I thought you were dead. I know. You will take me to the well at Sidi-el-Madia. No one will find me there. And if I refuse? Then I will have to kill you. And one of your men will take me. But do not be a fool. You should know when you have won or lost. And you have lost. Do what he says, commander. It'll be better. You will take your clothes off too. Shall we go? Well, let's go tell that horse's ass of an officer that he's lost his medal. Where could he've gone to? The only well around here is Sidi-el-Madia. I don't care how much of a Tuareg that son of a bitch is. He's got to drink sometime. Come on. You say that I committed a crime. And yet you cannot explain why. We belong to different races. We have different customs. That's what we have to forget, to become one people. The strong people. Rich and united together. You think that will be so simple? No. It will take time. We've won our freedom just a few years ago. It makes no sense to tear down an old house before building a new one. And you call yourself soldiers. I should have let you babies all alone. I come back and find you up shit creek with your balls hanging out. We missed you, Malik. One ass in a uniform is worth eight out! I don't think we're gonna have enough gas to reach the well. - We are not going to the well. - But you said... Yes, I know. The well lays in that direction. We are going to those rocks over there. It's impossible to climb that. I will climb it. Gazel, the hunter. You are proud of being who you are, right? Yes, you are not? Well, not really. I would prefer to be on your side. But you can't build the country that way. You talk too much. Watch where you are driving. Aren't you going to leave me any water? A little thirst should help you understand how I felt on the Salt Lake. But I'm too far away from my camp. You should not move from here. Set those uniforms on fire. They will see the smoke and come for you. Do I have your word you will do nothing until I reach those rocks? Good luck. - What's wrong, my love? - I'm sorry. It's just that I feel this business with the Tuareg is going to end disastrously. And to top it all off, Abdul-el-Kebir is mixed up in it too. - He's alive? - Unfortunately. - And where no one can find him. - Let's leave, Hassan. If Abdul-el-Kebir returns to power, they'll kill you. Let's leave before it's too late. Your excellency. - What is it? - I'm sorry, captain Razman is here. How many men does it take for you to get rid of one Bedouin? A division? I didn't want to risk any lives, your excellency. That Tuareg has made us both look ridiculous. You, as a member of the armed forces and me, as a governor of this province. At the cost of ten, even a hundred soldiers, that Tuareg should have been killed. You are making it into a political issue, governor. Instead, I have to answer for my men to my superiors. You wouldn't by any chance be one of those who would like to see Abdul-el-Kebir back in power? They are offering money for your head. Much money. Do you know who wants to collect it? None of our people will give you away. That is our custom. All nomads are praying to Allah the merciful, so that he will give you aid and strength. For us you are Gazel Sayah, the avenger. Only you can return Abdul-el-Kebir to us. Is this guest of mine really such a noble man? It is he who gave us our freedom. The most honest man among us. How long will it take me to reach Gerifies? On my best mehari, which is now yours, three days. Nothing to report! Nothing to report, major! Headquarters insists we reienforce our security measures. That nomad would be crazier than they are to attack this fortress. If he knows Abdul is here, then... The nomads always know everything that goes on in the desert. I know those ragged beggars alright. They're arrogant and treacherous. They run you before you know what hits you. I keep asking myself why they feel so afraid of that little guy. If he was my problem, I'd know how to take care of him. This little guy is already dangerous the way he is, lieutenant. And the last thing they want is a martyr. Take me to the prisoner. Drop that knife! For the last time... Who paid you to kill captain Kaleb? No one. And why are you involved with Abdul-el-Kebir? He is my guest. He isn't worth shit anymore! You picked the wrong master, Tuareg. Come on, speak. Who is paying you? I observe the law. I am the law. We are the law here. - You are murderers. - Shut up! Shut up you piece of camel dung! Let's go have a drink. Call me when he comes to. To hell with him. What the shit of they're trying to get out this guy? Who knows? It is natural to be afraid. But you did not run, and I am proud of you. A Tuareg can become a stone. A Tuareg can order his own heart to stop beating. Or his blood to stop flowing. Hey, what's the matter with this guy? He isn't dead, is he? Don't be an ass. Oh, so I'm an ass, am I? Come here. Take a look. Shit. Take the major here. And the medic too, quickly! Hurry, we are leaving. You are... There is a little time. Get your things and follow me. Where is the medic! Let's go! Gunshot! From the dungeon blocks! Sound the alarm! General alarm! General alarm! See lock detention block 3. General alarm! General alarm! See lock detention block 3. Prisoner escaped. Repeating, prisoner escaped. Prisoner escaped. Block all exits. There are three camels. Go and get them. I will take you to safety. I don't think there is a safe place for me, here, in my own country. We will go further. Beyond the "empty lands" of Tikdabra. Tikdabra. We lost their tracks a mile from the post. Our planes are still up looking for them. The tracks lead to North, toward the border, minister Mandani. There're three ways to reach it. Abu Gaila, the Guelta Abamar and the "empty lands" of Tikdabra. Finish, general Turkey. Abu Gaila is a flat zone. Jeeps could catch up to them and the Tuareg knows it. The Guelta is harder to reach, but it has several obligatory points of passage. We've already got them under surveillance, minister. And the Tuareg certainty must know this. I say, gentlemen, just who is this superman capable to holding the entire country in check? A man with perfect knowledge of a desert, minister. An exceptional man. I think he'll try to reach the border by crossing the "empty lands" of Tikdabra. Nobody can survive that inferno. What do you think, captain Razman? If there is a way to get through Tikdabra alive, - Gazel is the only one who can do it. - This, one must absolutely avoid. I can try to intercept him, by stationing troops on the other side of Tikdabra, but it's a danger they cross the border. We've risk an international incident. General, if Abdul-el-Kebir slips through our fingers now, the country will have a war on its hands. The soldiers are still looking for him, day and night. But they will never find him. I, Omar Tamin, say that all I have told you is a truth. And that I have seen Gazel Sayah, only six moons ago. - Have you really seen him? - Yes. Amed! Your father's alive. He's alive! - Is he really, mother? - Yes, and soon he will be with us again. I'm flying over quarter X-24. Air search negative. Can you really take power from them if you reach the frontier? I have no idea how things stand. Or who is still faithful to my cause. Or even if the French will support me. It's strange... The French. I thew them out of the country. And now they are the ones who can give me the power. Did the French imprison you too? For eight years. How long were you in prison after you won? Fourteen. Eight years with your enemies. And fourteen years with your friends. This I can not understand. Don't ask me to explain how the world works. Twenty two years in prison, to be four years in power. It is not worth it. No. It is not wort it. Nothing is worth one day in prison. Perhaps you are right. Perhaps I am fighting for the very same idea. Reconnaissance planes still have nothing to report. What do we know about Tuareg's family? They broke camp and disappeared. Perhaps it'd be interesting to locate the family and propose an exchange. You'll handle that, general? With all your respect, your excellency, I don't think it would be honorable to involve women and children in this. I agree with the general. What kind of reputation would that give the army? May I remind you gentlemen, that the army's reputation can't be any worse than is now. At this very moment, hundreds of nomads and Bedouins are sitting round their campfires talking about exploit of this great Tuareg. I don't care how you do it, but find me those two men! Mother! Mother! Soldiers are comming! - Amed, go inside the tent. - No, mother, I stay with you. Gazel Sayah, you know him? He's my husband, but he's not here. - You'll have to come with us. - Why? Your husband has became a dangerous criminal. And the authorities believe that the outrage people around here will attack you. Outrage people? What people? There's no one within ten days journey of this place. I know he travels quickly and I want to prevent incidents that could lead to a tribal warfare. You have five minutes to get your stuff together. - Puts them on the jeep. - Mother! Mother! We are wasting time, come on! Drink. Eat this. It is the best food in the world. A camel keeps all of its energy reserves in its hump. - Does one have to eat it raw? - Raw and freshly dead. I can't. Please, I can't. You are weak! Soon you will not be able to stand on your feet and I can not carry you through the desert. You must fight for your own life. Do not force me to choose whether I should let you die and save myself or die along with you. I can overcome the "empty lands", but I need you to help me. I will help you. My God. This silence. It's... It's as if the world had come to an end. The "empty lands". The desert within the desert. Amed! Amed! Amed! The "great caravan". The desert always reclaims what belongs to it. Merciful one, help me to understand. Have you chosen me to succeed, or my people had failed? You're pretty. Prettiest Tuareg woman I've ever seen. Yeah, that's beautiful. You knows how long it's been since I've seen a naked woman? That's all I've had all this time. But now... I have you! I am the wife of Gazel Sayah. If you touch me he will kill you! You think so? Maybe it's worth it. You shouldn't build up your hopes. I mean you might as well consider yourself a widow. Because the last I heard your husband was lost - in the "empty lands" of Tikdabra. - You lie! I'm telling you the truth. Look, you have two ways: willingly or not. I'd like it if you cooperate. It's more fun. - Don't touch me. - Why not? - I want to be your friend. - You're a pig! It's not what you think, commander. She came here because she wanted it. She told me so! - She wanted it! - Is that true? He told me that if I did not accept, he would have handed my son over to the soldiers. Why have you done this? Who are you? A friend. A friend of Gazel Sayah. Mine now. I'm gonna kill you, you desert rat! Hey, you guys, let's have some fun before we finish him off. You are crossed the frontier! Return to your own side or we will open fire. Let's finish it off before we get out of here. We have reached a new frontier. Abdul-el-Kebir. You are now a free man. Water. Water. Abdul-el-Kebir. My government's naming in my own I bid you welcome to our country. I never believed that there was anyone in the world who could cross with those lands. Avoid the Tikdabra. What are you going to do now? I have done what I must. Now, I am returning home. I've got some bad news for you, Gazel Sayah. The radio messages that we have picked up say that your family has been arrested. - Where are they? - In the capital. City where the president is. Then I will take him a message. Either he will free my family, or I will kill him. Do you need anything? Water or supplies... Yes. We'll wait until he wakes up? He'll want to thank you. He does not need to thank me. He is your guest now. Take better care of him than I did. It's forbidden to veil your face. They'll throw you in prison. Especially now when the whole city is closing with the president's police and soldiers. Look. What did I tell you? There. The president's police. Be careful, they hate the Tuareg. One of you has freed Abdul-el-Kebir. Allah be merciful that Tuareg! Because now, Abdul-el-Kebir is in Paris. You know what that means? That we, the people are behind him 100%, and if Abdul-el-Kebir manages to return, he'll show these filthy bastards. They'll give this, (He'll get them) and the president first of all.$ I would hide that gun better, if I were you. Hey, Tuareg! We are behind you. I want you to tell your president something for me. - Who are you? - My name is Gazel Sayah. Gazel Sayah! Tell him that I will give him one week to return my family. Or I will kill him. He has only one week. It's unheard-of! That blessed Tuareg is actually sending threats to the president, right here in the middle of the city! And what are your men doing about it? They have their hands full trying to keep public order, excellency. And if there is a revolt, as we fear, we can't even depend upon the army. How will I know? Look at these reports. All these concerning secret meetings in the garrison. Have you at least have words from Paris? The French are keeping Abdul-el-Kebir in a hiding place in secret. It'll be hard to eliminate him. Just perfect. All we need is a Tuareg who wants to murder a president. - What is the sea? - They say that it is like a desert of water. and that it can fascinate and that it can kill. Is it as beautiful as they say? No more beautiful than the eyes of Laila. One Tuareg in town dressed in black just stick out like a sore thumb. Use all the men you have and comb the city until you find him. Stay where you are and don't try anything! The government has been overthrown. You're all confined to barracs until further notice. No, Mr. president. The last we heard he has wounded. I too am sorry. He surely must be dead by now. I understand, Lord. You have given me life on that I may carry out your justice. Today is the great day for our country. The moment we've all been waiting for is almost here. The people are acclaiming their liberate. Streets are full of people shouting the praises of their president as he heads towards his residence in an open car. What a great hour for the entire nation. Together, the army and the people are celebrating the newfound freedom. Today is the time for jubilation and hapiness of all. At the very end of the avenue we can now see the procession moving through the enthusiastic crowd waving flags. Our beloved leader is happy to sharing excitement of his people. - Here he comes, here he comes! The president! - Here comes the president! You are... You are... You are... Why...? I do not take it upon myself to pass judgment as to what is truth or what is false. And it's your mind that has determined all destinies since the beginning of time. And only you see the nature of truth. You're all powerful. And I am your servant. Mother! Mother! He's back! fansubbed by OK & A
