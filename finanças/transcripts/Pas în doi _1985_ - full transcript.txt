The erection of men You don't talk to nobody anymore. Only misfortune gets people close. What do I care for you and your sweetheart. Stop it! You're acting like a clown. What? You got a problem with your student? What, do you care for me? She's caught you. Will you marry her? She should finish school first, and then you'll marry, you've said. So what if I said so? Want me to act like you do? How am I doing it? To walk with them, till they open up. So what? If that's the pleasure. Yeah? Get out of here, you're an imbecile! You're a fool. They tricked you all. So what? Do you think I care? And that blond? You were crazy about her. What! That blond. Which one? You know very well which one. That fat one! What was her name? Don't know. For five months... ...I was walking with her week after week I burn all the movies in the city, she made me mad. Did you know, that I'm ugly? You don't know to tell a girl "I love you". You don't know what poetry means. What poetry? Is that, what's needed? One! One! Down with it! Down! I'll give you poetry! Have you tired? Left! Right! Uppercut! In nature there are three factors that provoke waves on the water surface. The wind. Seismic motion and the force of attraction between earth and moon. I... ...I love you. Leave me. You're like all others. Don't touch me! Don't touch! What do you want? I want you to be mine. I want you to think about it. I want you to be with me. I love you. I love you, Maria. Wait! Don't run. I love you my sweetheart. You're disgusting! You all want the same thing. Tell me, what is it? Can I change it from 16 to 18? How? It's not possible. I understand. Wait for me, I've to tell you something. Rotaru! "Rotariu" man, with "i" like "Iulian". I've brought you the 20" knives. -Me again! -You're good, man! Make sure to pick up the rest later, because I'm not bringing it. Can't you do it yourself? -I've got stuff to do. -Yeah? I want to finish inventory, I'll have a reception in two days. Cut the fables, you're only strolling through offices. I'll loose 15 minutes, and I have to programm the machine. And lunch-break, can't you come then? -I can't, you see. -What are you talking about? Did you write the article? Why? I don't have time. Don't you want to write it. I took your 30"-32" key. How are you? Look how you've mired your face. Cut it off! Maestro, my word if I still get along with these guys. Please tell them to come after their components. I've got an inventory to do, reception in two days. And he should write the article. It's a anniversary number, he should do it. Nor me or you. I has got to his head, maestro. What is it? Give me that micrometer, will you? What? Micrometer, the one you promised. You're dying for a micrometer! Come on, please! You'll get it now. I have to work before lunch. Won't happen. Are you leaving? You were to leave me those pieces. Yes! Boy! You're barefaced. When do you give us those tools? Take a walk, I'm busy. When do you bring those tools? I've left you a note on the door. What, am I to wait for you? I need those pieces. Read it, and keep close, because I'll be back soon. That's the way, boy! What are you up to? You look like Santa Claus. I'm here to see you. What's up with... ...the kid? I've brought these presents for him. It means it's all over, is it? You should have understood by now. Do you know, that I divorced? Not for my sake, dear. You did it before... Depends. The child's mine too, is it? The child? You dare to speak about the child? You were unable to be a father! You're not up to anything. You're a coward! The child is mine only. You don't have the right to speak about him. What is this scandal? Isn't that what you're here for? Please do something to clear this situation. What situation? Want me to solve your problems? You know that I love you. Knock it off! How ridiculous we both are. You're ridiculous. Leave me alone! And don't come here anymore. Don't dare to mention him... You can't get along alone, don't you get it! You don't have cash. Don't tell me! I don't need your money, or your help. Good, if you want... If you say it's good like that. You want the same. You'll give me a declaration now that you don't have any expectations from me. What? write "I don't have any expectations from comrade Iulian Filică". that's from me, so please. Come on, write the declaration. Write! Come on, the declaration. Please, declaration! That's what you came for. I didn't come for this, but... This is what you came for. I beg you, write the declaration. That's what you came for, isn't it? You're unrecognizable. Comrades, we gathered in front of this leading collective. To celebrate those, who achieved remarkable results in the course of last year. And concerning the competition "Golden Hands", arranged by us according to departments they were the best. I'll read the names now. In first place and winner of the competition. Gheorghe Țeinea, Department 620, 340 points. Come over here. Maybe he wants to say a few words. Thoughts, that move you right now. Tell us your thoughts, man. Come on, a few words for your colleagues sake. He's not too fond of giving speeches He's stuck with the work. Let's congratulate him again, and applause for winning the competition. In second place. Munteanu Ion, Turn NR. 3 In fourth place Comrades! I'm proud of the honor.. ...which I've been offered To take part in the competition "Skillful Hands". In these moments... I'm touched. I wish to... express. My contentment. To the directorate... of our institution. To my colleagues. I'm... excited in these moments I can manage very well without him. When I told him I would go to see him after giving birth When I asked him to acknowledge the child. He said he'll check the difficulties at the shop. Right now I can manage without him. Do you still love him? No. -Did you love him in the beginning? -Don't know. Why did you do it then? Give me a break! -It's not why I came. -Then you loved him. He was a coward. Many of them are at the start. I understand that he wants you now. It's too late now. Why is it too late? It's good for the child to have a father. He doesn't want a child, he wants me. And what's wrong with that? The child will suffer. Why don't you let me talk to him. Don't get involved, please. It's my trouble. I fear that the most. You're getting me wrong. I want to help you. You need victualing-allowance. I don't. I have some cash too. You don't get it, the first to condemn you will be the child when he's grown up. -Why? -He'll start asking questions, his colleagues will torment him. What will you tell him? That he died. You think you can lie to him like that, and when he'll grow up? Let's get there first. That time will come too. He'll understand then. I'll explain it. You're wrong. Children, especially boys like to know who their father is. Who gave their names. When he'll find out he's bearing the girl-name of yours he'll ask for clarification. What will you say? "Stay healthy and we'll see" You know something? That mother and father lived life like strangers Because of us, you understand. Because we... They had two children, they didn't separate. They lived like strangers, and we felt it. I don't want that to happen to my child. I don't. As far as Iulian, don't get involved. Okay, I won't. I'm late. Shall we go? Have you told? To mother only. What did she say? What can I say? You want to go by any means? You know, I would like to be free too, not depending on anyone or anything. And to do what I want. You don't want to depend on anyone? That's impossible in my situation. Why? Because I need somebody, a man. At first it's mother, father, school you depend on. -You couldn't live alone all your life? -No. Why? Because I need you. I want a family, a house, children. If I pull your hair one day. Or I beat you. I get drunk. Are you upset? Leave me be! It'll pass, till you get married it will. On my word. I love you. -Are you upset? -Leave me alone! Really! Are you angry? Stop it! How am I to you? Handsome, smart? Handsome and smart too. And how else? You be good to me. Don't get me pissed or scold me. But you'll scold me. If I piss you off one day, make you sick. I'll forgive. And if you piss me off one day? -You'll have to forgive too. -Fairy tales! Why tales? There are many living together, and they're happy. -The ones you see in movies. -Look on the street! Yeah? Show me a couple who you think is happy. Leave me alone! Let me go! -These three, do you believe they're happy? -Yes. These women, do you think they're happy? Do you think they're happy? There, in the corner it sounds best, please. My girl told me, that you want us to get acquainted. Very good, I like it. You're not like others. You take me girl to walk her, to... To bemuse her, that she's queer that she's different, she's crone and grunts. Finally... It's better this way. We shake hands. Like men do. I... Come closer. I'm trusting you with her. The girl is serious. And if you're serious too. When you come we drink a wine, listen to some music. I know, you work at IAPT. You're a high-skilled worker. You're studying too, you take evening classes. That's always good. Our girl is studying medicine in her sophomore. We struggled too. To get her something working. We saved some money too. Now... She has got three years to go. We'll see. Your parents... Where are they? In Domnești. That far away? How did you end up here? I like cars. -You stay in the dormitory. -Yes. -How is it? -Very good. I'm not worried, that you're a worker and that she'll be qualified, no. We're people, people shall we stay. This counts. Nowadays a worker earns seriously. Wife! See, maybe the boy's hungry. -Leave it. -No, you leave it. -And the wine? -No! My daughter brings the wine. Leave it to her. Discipline! A little discipline is needed. Without discipline we can't do anything. Here, at home I feel in my element. Here nobody orders me: -Do this! Do that! Nobody! Don't you feel well? I'm dizzy. Have you told him? You think you can talk to him? Want to stay in underpants? I stay in underpants! Turn it up a bit. Immediately. There were times, when we worked a lot. We suffered. I was young like you. I worked in construction twelve hours a day. A whole team. We took a rest in the night and began in the morning anew. I worked. I was noticed, even made the papers. I even got the flag for leadership. The enthusiasm of youth. Now when I'll retire, I'll know that I didn't waste my life. I've done my duty for society, I was subservient to society. -Daddy, cut it out. -Let daddy speak, he knows what he's talking about. I don't have anything more to say. Healthy we should be! Do you drink? Of course. Do you work out? -Fencing, in my spare time. -Football! -No, fencing. -Fencing? A fencer! We'll have a duel then. Lower! That's it. Take a look at him. What happened to you? Give back my glasses! I didn't! I'm okay! Wait! Cut it out! I'm alright. -Which blow? -This one! Cut it out! What do you want? That painter screws around with your wife. What do you want from me? What are you fooling here around for? Get out of here! What decoration? Get out of here! It'll cost your mustache, If you don't behave. Even if you're a good turner. After lunch, eyes on me! -We have to assimilate three new guidelines. -We again? -Why did you finish that school? -Let it be, we'll assimilate. But this guy from the store, why... I didn't do anything! Hi Ghiță Mohamed Ali! We brought your bride. Look! Wash your head with her. Let it down, let it down. Leave him alone, he has exams coming. Let's see! What's the purpose of your visit? We came to ask you if you come to the disco. We don't know, let us think about it. -Why man? -We're tired man! Didn't you prepare something special? Then you hand us the music over. Bull crap! I don't give you anything. Here's the little fly should the mustache fall. Ghiță and Mihai's room. Modern chamber, maestro. Please. Yes, I see. What you're up to? What happened here? What's this? -We were rehearsing, maestro. -Rehearsing? Yes, we have disco tomorrow. With flakes? Yes, flakes. We need some more flakes. I came to have a chat, but if you're rehearsing. -Stay! -No, no, don't bother. -We're going. -Maestro, come with me. It's tidy, it's ordered. What's this, mathematics? Mathematics, yes. Is it difficult? This one's difficult. Learn boys, so it gets into your heads. You'll get it this way only. You too, and you too. Am I right? See for yourself. -Do you hear me? -What is it, man? -Have some mathematics! -Cut it out! -How's the part working? -It works wonderfully. What have I told you! Thanks! Catch it! Higher, man! Come on, come on! -How's this one? -It fits, it's running! Are you at home? What's up? What do you want, mister? -Is Maria home? -Yes, haven't you seen? Tell her please to come to the window. You leave her alone, she has nothing to tell you! She said so? Yes, you leave her alone. Tell her please to come to the disco tomorrow. Leave her alone! Tell her that I'll be there waiting for her. To hell! She's gone off her head! I'll cut your tree. You'll see to hell. You have to charm this one, to get something out of her. That's it I'm fed up. I've had it with the dormitory, the noise. Do you want more? Yes. Are the painters coming too? They do. Holy mother! There are some nice ones. There's one Really? You get me one I take her to an ice-cream, I take her to the movies, we walk a bit And then we get married. That's all. After that I don't have to wash, I'll stay at home I eat, I drink. She brings me the paper, I read it. -You're an exploiter! -A lord, man! The factory gives us a flat. Gives you a shit! You think it's that easy? Sure they'll give us. An apartment or a flatlet in a block-house. I'm telling you! -Hi! -Hello Guys! You've come too? -How, you want to be alone? -Common cleaning in the house! I'm getting married, boy! Big up, boy! You believe it's that easy? How I'm plodding to find me one. You have to walk with her, to charm her. It's harder for him, if they're ugly. Which ugly, boy? Any woman is beautiful in her way. You have to discover her. Is it clear? A woman has to be a friend of mine foremost. Not a servant, who cleans and irons, like he wants to have her. She should be... Man's missing half, in love and life. Dodo, the philosopher. Philosopher or not, he's right. You're right Dodo, that's it. The nicer you are to them, the more you suffer. They say you're a fool. Right, look at you! Shut up, I'll slap you ! Everyone with his luck. Words of the poet: -Happy we shall carry on Give them freedom, give them war. Give them freedom, give them war I'm all fed up with yours. Once again, man? -Why are you so shameless? -You do this on every occasion we wash. Take this one with you too. Forgive them, they don't know what they're doing. You really can't without me? Without your music. Interest. No. We can't do without your presentation. If they don't want to come, it's the biggest fight in the dormitory's history. -Ready? -Ready. Do I look fine? One, two, three. Check. Rain-water. Rain-water. Come on, play it. Should I ask her to dance? Should I go ask her? Go, go, don't let her escape. To dance, come to dance to dance Wanna dance? Yes, I do. -He invited me. -Wait a minute, I was first. Don't get upset, he invited me first. Isn't it too noisy here? It gives me the cramps. What did you eat last night Wanna dance? -No sweetie. -...the prepared meditation of the artist. Oh my dear heart how sweet love is This form born out of a anxious ecstasy to dance... Oh my dear heart how sweet love is, that I can't live without loving. How do you dance? My business! You don't have to dance with nobody. There are some nice guys around here. Why are you hustling me? I don't hustle you. But time goes by, goes by. So what? We're getting old, Maria. You bet I get her to dance? I bet whatever you want. -You won the bet! -How do you know, that I bet? I know, I saw! Does it mean something to you? Nothing more, that we danced together. -Do you want me to believe you? -Why not? Don't know. You don't seem dependable. Is there someone in the world inspiring dependability to you? Men under no circumstances. I had an aunt, who takes after you, and -And? -She's 70 and unmarried. I don't want to marry either. Are you sure? You will eventually. Maybe you don't know, but I've got a child. I didn't know. All of your friends know. Their business. I like children. If that's so, you can come anytime to see him. I'll manage by myself from here. You do? Certainly. Pickles. Cut it out! You'll wake everybody! Bobiță will sleep here. He's got some problems. -Okay. -There's the sheet. My pajama is clean. I'll give you a pillow. Tell me, what did you do? -I've nothing to tell -How was it? -I've nothing to tell. -I saw you leaving together. They've all seen you. I walked her till the corner. And, and, and...Listen, man! You can ask her, If you're interested in her. How can she interest me, are you nuts? -I'm not interested! -Cut it out! That's it! -Are you talking about Maria? -Yes. -From Painting Dep.? You're wasting your time. -Why? -She's entangled. -With whom? You won't believe it. My wife told me. What? She's involved with Iulian Filică. -With that sucker from the depository? -Yes With him you bully for meat. -The child's his? -Yes. Good night, boys! Good night. Listen Bobiță, I can't imagine how it goes in a marriage. One warm, one cold. Everything was so nice, you won't believe it. Four years passed, almost four. Then the child came. It got us closer. Then the hardship began. At first she liked to wash and iron for me. -Out of love she did it, you get me. -Out of what? -Out of love. -That's... she loved you. She loved me, boy. Finally she began to tell, that she's to young for me. Too young to get herself buried... ...so early. She was 18 when I got her. Then we saw, that we don't get so well along generally. -Tell me, that I don't have conscience. Yakty-yak. -Doesn't matter. The painter bought her. A hat. The corny one dancing at the party. I can't stand hats! Not on men, neither on women. I wake up in all kind of showings. Does she get it? She doesn't get anything, man! She wants to start painting. I think the painter convinced her. Is there something between them? I don't think so. But, can you know? Take care. Nowadays my wife wakes me with digs. Wake up you dotard! -Dodderer! -She's joking too, she's caressing you. What if I'm a doddered? What if? I didn't do anything, man. I'm not even 28. But I worked as a footman. Don't worry. She'll come home, and you'll correct her. -I don't know what to do. -You'll get steady. It's hard for me, Ghiță! Come on Bobiță, there are plenty of women left. You'll find another. Here you are, pretty one. -Are you talking to me? -Yes! Is it true? -I've asked you... -Get your hands off of me! Is Maria's child yours? -I've asked you if... -Take your hands off or we'll talk differently! Really? If it's yours, you do what you have to do. Got it? How's that any of your concern? Why do you meddle, when you don't know anything? What do you know? What do you know about my life? I don't care for your life. I'm not interested in you. I'm not interested. Got it? -What do you care for Maria? -I love her! -Marry her if you love her. -I will! Let her be there with you. Listen, it's the last time we talk like this. With all your boxing and so. Stay there! Listen to that. He doesn't know who he has to deal with with. If I catch him, mother what I'll do to him. What does he know boxing is? But let's see what Maria says. To make a child but don't recognize it. Is that a man? Is it true? The kid is yours? It's Julians? With Julian? So what if it's true? I have to know! Why? I have to know. Why's that? Just like that. It's true. You want something else? Yes! What? I want you to give me one too. What are you talking about? Come on, be serious! What are you up to? I want to try myself at biology. Nice! What did you choose? What did you get? I very old book of astrology. Stories about the stars. Really? I'm on my way, bye. Are you heading downtown? I'll join you. It's a very old book. And rather heavy. I've picked it to help adjust my bearing. Yes! I'm more upright. You'll have light. Do you like it here? Yes. It's warm, it's nice. -I'll leave you more room. -Okay. Don't cram things, don't collect too much junk. What do you think of the kid? I'll teach him to play the flute. Julian says the kid belongs to him. And yourself? He belongs to me, to the one who's raising him. Do you want to eat something? Yes, I'm hungry. I've got a stew. Cucumbers and cherry-liqueur. I'll eat. Let's see what we have left. Have you fallen asleep? I've brought supper. -Forgive me! -We'll leave the candle, it's beautiful. To our renewed get-together. The first time we met, you told me, that you can't trust men. Why's that? I've got my motives. And if I ask you to trust me? You have to trust me. I'll look after you and the kid. I'll be at your side all the time. Believe me. Do you like it? Very good! I'll prepare more. Cherry-liqueur? He's awake. I'll hand him over, so that you can torment him. Hold it, let me look who is it. Do you like it? Water, boy. He's my brother, Virgil. Mihai Rotariu. -I've brought some things from the country. -All these things! Flowers! The ones I like. -Am I not disturbing? -No, no, please come in. I'm going, I didn't sleep well last night. Stay a bit, you've got time. I you still need one or the other. Look! How he's eating. He's beautiful. He takes after me. Come on, stay a bit more. No, I'm on my way. I you need anything I'll come by next week. How are the doves doing? The state supports the family, family is the cell of society. -What do you want? -Is Maria here? -No she's not -Where is she? She left us, and got transferred yesterday. Yes, she got transferred. Why are you looking like that? -Where did she go? -She left some place else. You haven't told me! Why should have I? -How's that? -Who do you think you are? -I'll show you! -Don't shout at me. Don't be so cocky! Take care with her. Listen to me! Aren't you ashamed, talking to me like that? Good luck! What luck? Why do you wish him luck? Leave him, he's a good guy. -Good guy. What can I say? -He was joking. Don't take him seriously. -But Maria left without telling him. -And she did very well doing so. I'll put it to vote. Yes, we'll put to vote the day's issues. Of our general gathering, Section 620. Who's for it? Thank you. Against, somebody reserved? One abstinence. -A what? -An abstinence. Yes, we saw it. I propose another issue for today. Yes... Go on. It's about... The demeanor and moral attitude of some comrades. Who are you talking about? He's sitting... At your table. -Here with us. -Yes. Good, tell us more exactly what it's about, and we'll discuss it. -Come on... -If you started telling, tell it! Come on, tell us! We are asking you, please. What I want to tell you, we all know well. And even if Maria... is not a member of our organization anymore. the fact is not... is not more... not more grave, no? is not more grave. -I wanted to say, is not less grave, no? -More concretely! The more attentive you are, the more confusing you get. Even if! Maria Chirvase is not a member of our organization anymore. I propose... to those who... who granted her the transfer. To be severely punished. And she is to be brought back... into our midst, because... She was a good and hard-working comrade. Those who... didn't have a... an appropriate moral attitude. I propose them to respond in front of the collective. This is my proposal. This I had to tell, comrades. Tom-cat! Tom-cat! Tom-cat. Are you sleeping? I can't get that session out of my head. Come, sleep! We gathered here, so you don't disband anymore. -I looked for you, that I've gone mad. -You're right maestro! Come on, let's be serious! In music everything is mathematics. Or music is kind of mathematics. How's that, maestro? Well one plus one equals? Two! It's the same in music. Everything is done exactly. The notes come like numbers. The score is like an equation. Who knows the notes... can resolve the score. Clear? Yes maestro, but it's possible without notes too. It's simpler, why complicate it. I know one, who plays... by the ear. He has no idea of notes. And he plays better than our Trică, who knows the notes like a pro. That's a fiddler, not an instrumentalist like you. His business. In music everything is done exactly and tactfully. Like in turning, maestro. Here's the problem. If you work well. Then you play well. Don't forget, that you relieve the souls of people. You are artists, boys! You dress the wounds of those suffering. Like a doctor! This is music. A hall... and the instrument is the turn-bench. -Clear? -Clear, maestro! Then cut your cackle! Let's work! Maestro! -Maestro! -What? Can't I stay with my guide? I've learned the moves, I know them even while dreaming. It's not possible Next month we start with the new pieces for the truck beyond 10 tons. I need you at the end of the line. Me again, but Filică? A good turner can handle any machine or guide as far as I know. Even if it's hard in the beginning. Yes maestro, but! Aren't you the best turner? I am, but it doesn't mean I have to work for this. Even if not, you have to work where you are needed. I understand maestro. You're coming at me again, are you? Listen! Don't let the devil push you on my path next month. We'll work in the same zone. You know, that I move fast. Why don't you mind your business. Be calm, there's still to go until next month. Better concentrate, so you don't mess up the guides. Piss off! You've insured you're retiring, did you? -Yes I did. -We'll talk again. Yes we will. What do you want? I've thought a lot, and I want to talk to you. But I'm not good with words. If you want us to be together. I believe you know what I mean. No, I don't get it. If you want us to split everything in two. Is it a marriage proposal? Thanks, I don't need a groom. It's not about that. I'm not at the end, as some could think. I'm sorry if I hurt you. But maybe you think about it, some other time. Anytime. Never! I love you and don't want to do anything foolish. Never! What did you want to tell me? You don't love me. -That again. -You don't care for me. You know very well that's not true. and that I care. I wanted to tell you something. What? I'm getting married. How's that? Just like that. To whom? You're not interested. How, it doesn't interest me? To whom? To one of dad's colleagues. He asked you? Of course he asked me. What did you say? What could have I said, that I'll think about it, no? What will I do? I don't know, it's your business, but I don't have time left. You didn't come to talk to daddy, to sort things out. He found out? Was it hard to find out? What did he say? That we shouldn't see each other anymore. How shouldn't we.... Why shouldn't we? We're getting along pretty well. But if I get married. -You want to get married to him? No. Well, if you don't, you won't, and that's that! -I have to. -No, you don't! You don't have to marry him, if... I'll come to talk to your father. When? As soon as I can. Right after the exam. Good. I'll be expecting you. Do you love me? Yes. Me too. Are we going to the movies? We stay here. -But they"ll see us. -And what if. Tom-cat! Tom-cat! I've brought your money, boy! Can't you hear me? Tom-cat! I've brought you the money. I'll get it in from somewhere else. But what's with mine, are they cracked or dirty? I don't get it. I'll get it from somewhere else. What is it boy? Are you upset? Tom-cat! Listen to me! You trust me, not them! You've been to see Maria? Yes, last night. You're upset? Didn't you tell, that you're not interested in her? Didn't you say so? With Maria it is completely different. And if the boys got something out, their problem. You trust me!? I've seen you enter the building. Obviously, I've been to see her. What's with you? Are you miffed at me? If it was someone else. I would've strangled the bastard. But you're my best friend. Aren't you my best friend? Yes, we're like brothers. Aren't you my best friend? Of course. Don't you trust me anymore? -What's up? -Mr. Repository! Have you messed the guides up, boy? What guides? Didn't I tell you to have care, to concentrate? The maestro is looking for you. Get out! -Get out! -Leave him! Wait! Trust me, Tom-cat. -Yes, I've seen. -You trust me! Who made this? What's with it? What quota did you use? 16 to 14. What 16 to 14? Have a look at the sketches. Where did you come up with 16 to 14? Are you blind as a chicken? Take a good look at it! The guys are too noisy, I can't concentrate. -Listen to him, he can't concentrate. He's too sensitive! Cut it with your goats! -Before starting to work you have to find silence in yourself. -I'll fix it. Hand me unfinished parts. Give him unfinished parts! Come on! Give me unfinished parts! I want unfinished parts! That's what I need. Unfinished parts! I can't concentrate! Cut it out! I want unfinished parts! I want to work! - Monica, haven't you got to do in the kitchen? -No. Then leave us alone for a few moments, please. But I want to stay with you. Please be of help to your mother. Tell me, dear! I'm listening. I... That is... -I'm listening. -Now that you know, yes. Now, that you know... that the two of us... That is, myself with Monica. I want to say, that my feelings... for Monica are... Exist. And I thought of our future too, surely not now. One year or two. Till I... I get rid of some problems. -My studies, Monica. -Perfect! And if you're... if you agree. I knew. I told her from the beginning that you're a serious man. It couldn't be else, I'm good at knowing people. Surely, you're still young, have a whole life ahead of you. It's good to know, surely. Now, my girl. Not, that I want to praise her now. But some and others began to ask for her. The girl's pretty, it's obvious. Young. But if your feelings are serious... and you have serious intentions. I'm glad, I'm most happy. What can you drink with this glass? Liqueurs, delicate drinks. -Why are you shouting, we're here. -Have a drink, please. You too girl, don't be shy. Now, to the future! And to the young ones. I would like to meet your parents. To get to know them. As is only fair. Wife, let's leave the betrothed alone. You want some more? You don't like the idea, do you? You looked as if you were going to be slaughtered. You came up too fast. -So it shall be! Are you afraid? -No! I'm happy that you came, after all. And that you spoke to daddy. -You weren't late. -I wasn't late You wouldn't have found me. Really? It would have meant, that you don't love me. That it doesn't make any sense. And if I love you. Why did you leave the factory? I'm closer to home, and to the small one. Actually the chief of section tried to hustle me. He told me if not, I should get a transfer. He's married. What? He's a donkey. How I would like to take him out. Leave him alone, there's nothing to gain. Do you want to go to the country next week? -Where? To your folks? -Yes. To my home. We'll go to my place, to Virgil. I've got someone to take care of the kid. I'm very lucky with my aunt finding me a job again in the store. You like it better here? No, but I'll get used to it. Will you come? Yes, we'll go. -I'm going, bye. -Bye. Long live our groom! Don't beat her. My mother taught me like that. Whatever will be, don't beat her. Don't worry, I won't. -Yes. -Let's see how you'll manage overnight. Leave the guy in peace. Happy marriage! Take care of her. Come on Dodo! Come on, have a drink! I wish you luck, Felicia is a good woman. Come on, tot the bottom. Be a man! Listen, trumpet! As of tomorrow Dodo'll be more of a man than you. So shut up. What are you doing? What do you mean? Do you think, that I haven't seen women? To see we've seen all. Long live her! Long live her! What are you looking at me like that for? You're telling me again, that you're leaving us. I'm sorry to hear, but he's a good boy. Where will you stay? They'll give us a flat. So swiftly? -Don't count, it's been a year. -Where will you stay till then? -Don't know, we'll see. -Yeah? Leave it, I'll take it. Prepare to leave. I've been running for two hours after you. I'm finished. -Come on! -Say hi to the guys. Leave it! I know them very well. Don't worry, we'll see you. If she got wet at the dormitory, I've brought her. Thank you! Why have you that crown on your head? So you won't have any token from this wedding. Don't beat her. The children came to visit. -My sister-in-law. -Mihai Rotariu. Put something on the table. Nice farm you have, I like it. Nice, but a lot of work too. -Look, if you want to wash up. -Thanks. -Does it bite? -No! Rainwater? Yes, you can wash yourself. I think they think the kid is yours. That's how people are in the country. Did you tell them? No, my dear. As they please, their business. Let's try something when you're ready. -How are you? -I'm fine. -Who's this boy? -A friend. Is he the father? No, I will tell you. Him or...? We'll talk. I'll tell them, that they're wrong. Who's wrong? They, or? -Why? You don't have to. -Yes, I do. That's how our people are. Of one piece. -Are you pleased? -Yes. -How's the kid doing? -He's okay. Don't you miss him? Of course I am. You've rushed it a bit. That's how all of our folk are. Fiery! Well, now... the wedding will come. Soon. People began to talk. Doesn't matter. You'll straighten things out. I'm sure. All will be fine. Cheers! Did I say something wrong? People these people. You could have said something. You could have said anything, it wouldn't have mattered. Forgive me, but it was never agreed, that the two of us... You're right, we never talked about it. How foolish I've been to believe... In the end... Why should you take a woman with a child. -It's not that -There are many others, who... -It's not that -You can be much more... happy. That's not true. You still love me? Don't know. But I know. What? That you love me. What's with you here? Why did you come? I came to see you. Shall we. How was the trip? Good. Why didn't you call? I've just arrived yesterday. What's with you? You've come out for a peek. What have you seen? Have you seen me bare ass? Get inside or I break you! Come on, watch the game! -What game? -Are the games over? Come on, go watch a game! Dodo is working hard since he's married. Let's go over and see what he says. Hello boy! What's up? How's it going? It's working. He's looking good, crummy. -You're tired? I like it. -Leave me alone, I don't have time for excesses. Of course he's well of. He's got a home, a wife. Break it off! -You're taking it easy Ghiță. -Just a cigarette maestro. You've got oafish, all of you. What's with you Mihai? Are you playing? Dodo has a break of 50 points. Dodo is a married guy, without problems like we, the unmarried. What's that? -Should I find you wives, or what? -Yes. Wouldn't be bad, maestro. But two or three for each. Some of us can't even do else. I would be ashamed. What did I do, maestro? You know it, you know it well. They've cawed something up again. I see to my affairs, and so should they. I would feel ashamed. That's all I wanted to say. Come on, get back to work. Leave that cigarette. How's it going, Dodo? Good girl Felicia, isn't she? Do we want to grab a bear? Of course, after work. -Of course. -You, who doesn't ever drink? Once in a while, occasionally it can happen. Maybe you'll tell me what's happening to you lately. I tell you all, that can be told. Listen, Dodo! What do they want from you? I don't know. How's it being a family guy? Did you buy furniture, an oven, a fridge? Did you leave her pregnant? Why did you get married then? Why are you so tight, what are you thinking of? What's happening to you? I'm tired, I'm bored of school. I'm boring you, am I? Why are you lying to me? Don't touch me, when you're talking to me! -How should we talk? -Normally. You're seeing somebody else, are you? You're still closed in yourself. I won't give up, you know. I'll die if you leave me. Cut the crap, you have the kid and you'll raise him. You've got things to do. What are you thinking of. I'm thinking of us, of... the future. Of children. That turkey-boy. I will teach him to play the flute. What's on your mind? I'm thinking of how bad people are? They labeled you once, and it doesn't count what you feel. Nothing counts further more. -You have the same mentality. -You're offending me. I'm not one to be desired by upstarts. -I still exist, do I? I know. You do, that's why I came back to you. You don't know what a woman feels. You don't know what I feel. In any case I don't mean to you what you mean to me. I've had the child, because I thought it is the right thing. I don't care what people say. You know, I would not have him if I would have not wanted him. Thank you It's not easy at all, you know. Please. That man was a major setback for me. Let's not talk about it anymore. Ghiță told me already. We're like brothers. We've been in the army together. He was courting me for a while. He continues even now. Yes. He's a good guy To whom? To life. You're hiding something, do you? I didn't hide anything from you, ever. You know how I am, don't you? What should I do? Tell me, what should I do? What should I do? Say something! Who should I give up on? How can I tell just like that "It's over", and to whom? Especially now when both of them means something to me. I'm bound to both of them by something very strong! You get it? Understand? No! I'm behaving like a bum! That's it, no? -You've said it. -You think like that! Come over here! Sooner or later... you would have made someone miserable anyway. That's precisely why I can't do it! Because I know I will make someone miserable. -I'll do it! -You don't! I'll see to it. When, a year, ten? Whatever. What do I care. What would you do? I can't be in your place. True, you can be only Ghiță. I can be only Ghiță. Truth is not one. -What is the truth? -Me, Ghiță! With my turn-bench, my sack, with my hand me with my bare hands. You say happiness is egotistical! You're the happy one. Your stomach! Your hands! Your fists! What you can do with your hands! -You know what? -What? I'll move. -Yes? Where will you move? -In Dodo's place. -You've said, we're like brothers! -Yes. Maybe this way I'll have more luck. What's with you here? I've moved in Dodo's place. Why? Are you getting married? Next year. Next year? Take this. So be it in the right time. Take it! Have you been drinking gas? I was joking! You take your stuff and get out! -Look what he did. -That's my bed. I've come to ask you to drop by today. Why are you so sad? You're beautiful like that. I want us... to talk a bit. What happened? Nothing. I'll tell you. We love each other, do we? I don't know. Maybe. I love you. Love you. Long shall they live, long shall they live Long shall they live! Go! I'll see you later. Please! I'll come to see you. Go after her! Don't leave her like that! -I won't! -Go after Maria! -I won't go after nobody! -Go and tell her everything! Go and tell her, so she knows who you are! I'll show you! Go, or I kill you! I'll kill you! Leave him! Go and tell who you are! Show your face! What did he do to you? Shut up! Why? Calm down! Calm! We'll have a happy times. We'll have children... many... we'll... Why?
