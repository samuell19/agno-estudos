BASED ON THE NOVEL BY CHRISTIANE ROCHEFORT It's freezing. Shall I close the window? Your father liked draughts too. What's your heating bill? Twenty-five thousand. No wonder why. We don't die of pneumonia nowadays. If your father had waited a few years… How did Aunt Lucie die? I never remember her disease. Coronary thrombosis. She left everything to you. That's nice of her, but I'm her parent too. She knew I wasn't rich. And your dad's allowance? Only 100,000 Francs per month. This flat is worth 30 million. Don't start again. Daddy died here, I'll never sell. Too bad. The furniture's horrible. But full of memories. Memories of his mistresses. -You were divorced. -That's no excuse. It must be Pierre. Can you let him in? It's the laundry. Leave it in the hall. Have you got 100 Francs? In the ashtray on the piano. Sorry, I thought you were the laundry man. My compliments, madame. -I paid. -Thank you. Geneviève is ready. I put my hat on and I'm all yours. We're late. -We have time. -And the traffic? -Not in the morning. -Sure? Was she always scared of missing her trains? She has common sense. It is a virtue for a single woman. My hat-pin pricked me. If you want my opinion, I would say that women should not be single. Mom, I'm not a spinster yet. If it makes you happy, we've decided to get married in a few months, in the spring. -You tell me just like that? -How else? It's big news. I'm always the last to know such things. She is upset. She wanted to know before we did. Hurry, we'll miss the train. Is it true, Pierre? It's under serious consideration. I forgot to turn off the gas. Just go, I'm running late. Give the keys to Mrs. Pia. Bye, Mrs. Pia! I'll be back in two days! Bye, miss! She's going on a trip? -She received an inheritance. -A big one? Possibly. I hope she won't move away. I'd be sad. Nice young ladies like her are rare. -Not much business on the railways. -The train leaves in 25 minutes. I'll have plenty of room. -Wish I was coming with you. -You have to work, darling. Well, 48 hours isn't very long, I could have done it. But I have a new boss. Two days is nothing. Are you in a hurry? Yes. -I still wish I was coming. -Me too. Bye, darling. Have a good trip. HOTEL ENTRANCE TERMINUS HOTEL Do you have a room? For how long? One or two days. Single or double? I'm alone, can't you see? I'll give you number ten. LE THEIL, GENEVIÈVE BORN: 3/28/36 PARIS Hello? Yes, I hold. It's the hotel… First floor, on the right. -Yes. -It's a long story… I'm sorry, sir! Sir! Sir, there's been an accident! An accident? A client. -Which one? -Number six. Really? And how do you know? I mixed up the room numbers. Your key opened number six? That's odd. You should go take a look. It's not my business. -Room six? -Yes, six. Two times three. Sir, wake up! I don't think he will. If that's what he's done… That's very smart. I'll have to call the police. It doesn't work that well. It does, luckily for you. You would have found him dead. And he will be soon. Renaud Sarti. Student. He doesn't look young, though. Did you see his ID? He copied it out in front of me. He probably destroyed it and threw it away. The number is fake. -Take a closer look next time. -Yes, Inspector. He'll survive. He'd been here only three hours before we found him. This lady. Do you know that man? Mrs. or Miss? Miss. No, I don't know him. Did you get here today? By the 2,50 p.m. train. From Paris too? Yes. You'd never seen this man before? No, I told you. I'm here for business, to settle the inheritance of my aunt, Mrs. Lescure. I came to see her lawyer, Mr. Varangé. "Six: A property of 80 hectares of fruit orchards located in Longvic." I'll keep the domestic appliance shops but not the real estate. I'll sell the Treasury bonds too. I'd rather have stock. I was going to offer you advice, but you don't need it. Yes, I need it. I don't want to do anything silly. For the real estate… All in good time. First we must sign the deeds. It's 8 p.m. already. If you allow me, after you've signed, may I invite you to dinner to talk? Sorry , I'm not usually late. Finding a poisoned man here, where nothing ever happens, that's unexpected. Nothing happens to me either but here I am, a millionaire and St. Bernard at once. Where do I sign? Here and here. -And to drink? -Sorry. A good red Burgundy? With grouse… A Volnay? Give me a second, please. A Pommard. Please. Grouse… Chambertin. -A '45? -Do you have a '49? Yes, the best one. Yes, I know. A little more robust. Preferable, I think. So what am I dealing with? How much could I get for the real estate? -About ten million. -That's not enough. There's nothing I can do. Pechiney, the bonds, the real estate… If you allow me to ask, why realize two-thirds of your capital? To work. I want a business to keep me busy. I thought you were getting married. Exactly. I want something to do. Something interesting. So why are you getting married, child? You haven't answered me. I think ten is like six, and if ten didn't open six… I was thinking of that guy, waking up at the hospital with no money or ID. Him who'd thought it was all over. I was told to ask you about Mr. Sarti. -The man who tried… -Are you a relative? No, I found him. -This way. -I don't want to see him. -I just wanted… -He'll be delighted. He's expecting you. He wants to meet the woman who gave him his life back. He's given you all sorts of names. Girl Scout, guardian angel, St. Bernard, nanny, guide dog, St Geneviève. He is so funny. Since he's been better, he hasn't stopped joking. Here she is. You were right, she came. Here is the angel. How are you after all this? I'm all right. What about you? What can I say? I'm in very good health. I'm glad you're pretty. You could have been a traveling salesman. I'd rather it was you who saved me. I didn't mean to. I opened the wrong door. God gave me life but wouldn't take it back. Even at a discounted price. For nothing. For free. He loses nothing by waiting. One day, I will die. Don't cry anymore. Is there anything you need? Absolutely nothing, thank you. You've already done too much. How long will they keep you? They got me in time. They're not keeping me in. But if you leave, you don't have… Have you contacted your family? A friend? You can take care of him. No way! I came to… Wait in the corridor. But miss… -You're not tired? -I'm fine. I'm in a great mood. -Got any cigarettes? -I don't smoke. Is that briefcase heavy? My toothbrush andDonQuixote, my bedside reading. I like noble deeds too. I told you, it was a mistake. If it hadn't been for you, my soul would have flown up there. You'd better get used to it. My soul is yours. Cumbersome, isn't it? You can always throw it away. It's not asking for anything, from you or anyone. It doesn't give a damn. Got any cigarettes? Still no. That's right, sorry. Good idea. I'll have quail after the hors d'oeuvre. Sir, have you chosen? A yoghurt. -As a starter? -Yes. And some noodles. We don't have any. -He is on a diet. -Really? We have rice with fatted chicken. Rice and a wing of cold chicken. And a yoghurt. -Another yoghurt? -Yes. And to drink? Mineral water? -A dry white. -Okay. I'd like to see that prescription. Are you interested? Show it to me. You don't like my hair-style. I like your hair. The only thing about you that's ill-mannered. -Madame has finished? -Yes, thank you. Would you like some coffee? -Yes. You too, Renaud? -Yes. Two strong coffees. -Liqueurs? -A cognac. Two! So you haven't read the prescription. -My God! -My God, what? My train! You should have said "My train!" Don't joke. Waiter! My train leaves in 15 minutes. -I wasn't joking. -Waiter! Missed it. It's never happened. There may be another train one day. Tomorrow, at 10,33 a.m. 3,20 p.m.,10,33 a.m. Today, tomorrow, May 1st, July 14th. Does it matter? We've no reason to be alive. -Speak for yourself. -I do. Well, I have something to do. I'm going to see my inheritance. Let's go and see that inheritance. This is where my aunt lived. I've always loved this house. Renaud! Renaud! It will keep us going 24 hours. We're not staying here. Why not? Because. I don't know. I know. You're thinking of your reputation. I don't care about that. That's a lie. When you got your luggage from the hotel, you left me in the taxi on the corner. You were scared to be seen with me. You should sleep here, you'd be more comfortable. -Too small. I like big beds. -Take the bedroom. I'll stay here. Please go, Renaud. Please. I couldn't sleep. I wanted to see you with your hair undone. I thought you were in bed. Go away, Renaud. Let your hair down and I'll go. You have a lover. Don't you like when he looks at you? I always turn out the light. You make me say terrible things. The truth. That's all. Stand up. Your lovers are fools. I still haven't kissed you. I own your soul. That's all. Mind, body and soul. You've inherited all. They all work together. Not here! We were alone for 24 hours… There are places for that sort of thing! -What will you do now? -You know. Live. -Where will you go? -I don't know. -You'll go somewhere. -No. It's silly. You came from somewhere. I came from nowhere. I wiped everything out when I entered that hotel room. Officially, I'm a dead man. A very stubborn dead man. Come on, Tino. Miss Geneviève, did you have good trip? Very good. I'd like my keys. -And the inheritance? -Everything is fine. He's singing! Miss Le Theil, too. Like the others. I'd never have believed it. You shouldn't have put your arm around me. Why not? In an hour, all the neighborhood will know. I don't mind. Locks like that must tempt burglars. You don't want them to know. Drat! Hello? Yes. Mom… I was worried. You were returning yesterday. You should've called. I'm fine. I missed the train. You missed the train? Well! Come have dinner with me. I'm a bit tired. -You said you were fine. -Yes, but tired. Stay there, I'll come and bring dinner. No, I promised Pierre I'd have dinner with him. But you said you're tired. You're talking nonsense. Call me when you come to your senses. And don't wait for a week. I'd like to hear your news. I'll call you tomorrow. -No crime novels? -There should be some Simenon. That's not crime, but psychology. -Isn't there a bed? -The bedroom is over there. -Agatha Christie is better than nothing. -Don't you want to see my patio? I don't care about the view. Anyway, we're shut in. You'd be just as happy in jail. I wouldn't have a bed like this. Having such a bed is a miracle. They're usually too small. My father had it made to measure. -And there are no girls in prison. -Thank you. People seem to know when one gets home. -Hello, Genevieve. -Hello, Pierre. -I called yesterday. -It took longer than I thought. I come pick you up. Mother just phoned me. She wants to have dinner with me. She insists. I can't get out of it. Yes, it wasn't so easy. I'll have to make arrangements. It would be too long to explain. No, I'm fine. -Your voice sounds strange. -Not at all. -l know you. -I don't know. -Maybe it's the trip. -What are you saying? How could the trip change your voice? -You must be in trouble. -No. Don't have any qualms. You can ask for my help if you need. -I'll call you tomorrow. -Yes. -Goodnight, darling. -Goodnight. -Here. Lying must be very tiring. -No, thank you. I couldn't let him come over here. -Tonight or tomorrow. -Tomorrow, it will be different. -What will be different? -You won't be here. I couldn't leave you in the street, but you need to find a place to live. No one, not even my fiance, has slept in this bed. Why? Because it's not done. -It isn't done? -Not in here. Somewhere else. I wish I hadn't opened the wrong door. I'm lying. Since yesterday, I feel I am constantly lying. -I don't understand, Renaud. -Come here. Come. You take no pleasure? I have never been so happy. Not really. Don't blush. A lot of women are like you. It's a matter of time. Yes. No science-fiction? -I didn't know you liked it. -I do. I'll buy some tomorrow. Gagarin here. -Is it lunchtime? -Yes. -What? -You're asking if it's lunchtime. -Is it funny? -It must be at least 9 p.m. I have no sense of time. The clock has stopped. Again! You've put a spell on all the clocks. You think so? Here. Damn! That was the last one. -The fifth one this week. -Buy metal ones. In the Girl Scouts, they called me the Busy Bee. Very charming. I've no time to do anything. Do what? Tidy up, see my friends, look after my affairs, go to the theater, see exhibitions… Is that what you call doing something? -Yes. -Well. We can't eat dinner in this mess. Get undressed. I've not cleaned for two days. Get undressed and clean up. Are you mad? Not at all. I want you to clean up naked. You've got weird ideas. Everyone does, but they hide them. I don't hide them. I'm honest. -You don't want to? -No! Renaud! Renaud! Renaud! When I was 14, I got pneumonia. Each morning, my cousin cleaned the room. To pass the time, I used to imagine she was naked. 14-year-olds are always a bit depraved. I was ashamed and I didn't ask her to take off her dress. I was right to wait. She was not as pretty as you. What were you doing in the dark? -I was doing the accounts. -In the dark? Armand! Yes, Armand. My crockery! -The crockery! -No! Stay there, I'll make the bed. If my mother saw me. No chance she sees you. But the neighbor's a different story. Renaud, that's awful! The shutters were open. What's awful? Being naked? Have you read the Bible? Your body's not obscene. What's obscene is how that man looked at you and what he thought. Stay where you are, young woman of principles. When I think about what I was like ten days ago, I wouldn't recognize myself in the street. I'm not even capable of being ashamed. If you love, just be capable of loving love. Or keep quiet. Why are you laughing? That's the tragedy. You're a woman, a real woman, for the first time. I find this joyful. Dry your tears. Smile. It's no drama. Don't make a deal out of it. -Why did you laugh at me? -I didn't. Explanation: I was laughing at your vocabulary. You shouted, "Renaud, I love you." I laughed because you call that love. It's true that I love you. What can I do about it? If I could, I'd stop right now. It's true, I'm a pain regarding vocabulary. One day, I'll write a thesis. I'll call itOn Love. It already exists but it needs a good reworking. I'll call itOnLoveand I'll be against. Here, drink. Why are you against love? What has it done to you? Has it hurt me? Answer: no. Comments: what do you think? My face frightens it? Quite the opposite, you've seen. I want to die and when I do, what do I find? Love. I've been drowned, filled and saturated with love. I'll never say I love you again. I'd rather rip out my tongue. Don't make that face. All the people I know, that are like me or rather like the old me, can they pass themselves by without knowing? Without ever knowing anything? I feel like I'm from a different planet, I don't recognize anything. Five. -Six. -What are you counting? The telephone. Twelve is the record. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Twelve and a half. A new record. I knew you were there. You didn't want to answer? I'm begging you. Don't make up more excuses not to see me. Something serious is happening. You must tell me. I can't wait any longer, Geneviève. The situation is becoming ridiculous and odious. No, listen. If you won't come here, I'll wait for you near your flat. You can walk 100 yards. Come right now, I'm begging you. I have to go out. See you later. You've changed. I know. Is there someone else? Yes. I thought so. Where did you meet him? During your trip? Yes. Geneviève! You're making a mistake. You're not yourself. -You confuse pleasure with love. -What do you call love? You know, Geneviève. You loved me. You told me so. What do you call love? Being happy and unhappy together. Spending our life thinking of one another, being two. And? -You don't know what you're saying. -Maybe. This man is destroying you. I don't know him, I just need to look at you. One day you'll realize I'm right. If you need me, don't hesitate. You know I'm still your friend. Fucking bitch! Did you bring any drink? There's nothing left. I didn't bring any drink, sorry. I was not in the mood. I've just broken up with my past. And even with my future. You still have the present. What present? Let's talk about it. -What are you doing? -Putting on my jacket. Why, Renaud? There's nothing for me here. But I love you! What they call love, I swear! All right, leave! Get out! Hope you find a better position, you pimp! What have I done to you, Renaud? What did I say to you? Renaud, come. -Leave me alone. -Come, please. -With what conditions? -No conditions, you know it. What do you want me to do? I'll do what you want. You don't want anything. You make fun of everything I have. -I love you. -I don't need to be loved. But I need you. What do you need? You. Me what? -You to be there. -It's vague. -I need… -What? You. -Is that what you want? -Yes. So say it right now. You never say anything either! Because I don't care, I'm afraid. The more I think, the less I care. The less I care, the more I think. If you don't care, why don't you come back? At least you'd be useful. The truth at last! That'll work. I like to be useful. Even for little things. It makes me feel like I exist. Come back, I've had enough. Yes, beautiful. I'll follow you like a blind man. Since that's what you want. Take a good look at me. You've never looked at me. You always look at yourself. You don't know where you set your foot. -There's nothing underneath. -I don't care. Listen. I'm no good at being a nurse or a Boy Scout. I won't tell you again. Run! Go! Get out! -I have nothing to give you. -I don't care. That's what you say, but you'll regret it one day. Run. Get out. Don't look back. No. Have you thought it well? Yes. Follow me, then. You're right. We must fight. For Monaco, Denmark, Corsica. For anything, but we must fight. Blood must be shed. He's leaving? You've convinced him to sign up. Let's go, they're closing. You're right. -Daddy! -Where have you been? In a bed. Made to measure. With rivers, oceans and continents. I see. Fernand, I'll have the same. You've not become manager yet? Let me introduce myself. Katov. Geneviève Le Theil. -You're not his father? -God forbid! -Where did you dig him up? -In Dijon. Dijon? Why the hell did he go there? -To die. -Why? I was hoping you'd tell me. One day or another, to go all the way. He had to try that too. -Have you known him long? -Since the Occupation. I came out of the blue and found him. He wanted to be in the Resistance. I still am. He had an ideal at that time. Renaud, an ideal? That's unexpected. With him, everything is unusual, attractive, dangerous. He destroys himself and he destroys everything he touches. Know how to kill a spider? -No -Know how to kill a spider? I know how. I'll show you. -Has he always drunk this much? -How much? I don't know. He must drink in secret. I've spent 40,000 Francs on whiskey in two weeks. I drink in secret, she does the sums behind my back. Lovely couple. Thanks to you, I'm going to be rich. -I'm a sculptor. -Alas! About two weeks ago, my studio was burgled. I went to the police, it was a big fuss. Three days later, my statues were found in the marshalling yard of Villeneuve-St-Georges. Renaud had hired a van and paid a driver. Poor guy was so scared of going to jail, he told me everything. Pictures in the papers, my show is a success. Glory. I have a check for one million Francs, 5% commission. The only excuse of art nowadays, since it stopped being art, it sells well. You would've sold anyway. The mechanism had to be put in action. That's what I did. I'll never get my check. He's too stingy. I was starting to get cold. -Raphaëlle, you'll like her a lot. -She's yours? I met her after you disappeared. I adore her. You're a hopeless case. Hopeful or not, does it matter? Good morning. So, you're not dead. I thought I would wait till you called, but you are my daughter. I was worried. You could have been sick. No, I'm not ill. I… What? Well… -You've started smoking? -No. Yes. You look like death warmed up. Obviously, you just got out of bed. At noon! -You'd do better to tell the truth. -I was just going to say… There's someone there. Sorry. You could have told me. That's unpleasant. -And that isn't Pierre. -No, it isn't Pierre. Pierre or not, have the lovers you want. This flat has seen plenty. The father's adultery. Mrs. Pia is not surprised, I'm sure. The concierge, too. -You're over the age of majority. -The law! I'm concerned for your health. Her well-being. And this pigsty is not reassuring. The order! -Coffee? -No, I've been here too long, already. When can I see you? We have things to talk about. -Can I come tomorrow? -Well… So this situation is permanent? For now. Permanent for now. Perfect. It's your business. Goodbye, darling. I'll wait for you tomorrow. -It will be just us. -Yes. I never knew my mother. She died giving me life. Too late. I was there. -No! On an empty stomach! -It's cleansing. It's a vicious circle. I don't know if you'll ever stop. Me neither, beautiful. It was a bit cold with your mother. I hope you covered up. -No time. -Renaud! "Renaud!" Hypocrite. Come closer. It's only shocking from a distance. Leave me alone, damn it! I'll leave you alone if you lend me 50,000 francs. I said no, damn it! Just till tomorrow, I swear. Fuck off. He's a total drunk. If I lent him the 50,000 Francs, he'd be dead by morning. Renaud calls him Doctor. He was struck off 20 years ago. I didn't know Renaud liked classical music. One day, he fell asleep at a concert. He even snored. I almost died of shame. With my million, I'll buy a truckload of cashmere jerseys. -Or a calculator. -To calculate what? The future. I'll be the secret adviser of leaders. I'll announce wars, even the ones that don't exist. So they'll be obliged to fight them. Coco, tell me what you're writing. He's a great poet. Maybe the last poet on earth. "Blue, color of blood. Red, love. Green, hate. White, sun of the insane. The rainbow is in our eyes." -I'll buy it. -I don't sell my work. -For one million. -You haven't got it. It's to the bearer. You can cash it. Too bad for the calculator, but it's a safe investment. Nowadays, art is worth more than Suez or an oil field. You're going to be very rich. I know. It's in my horoscope. Maybe he does love you, after all. You have to be the strongest. If you could make him do something… It's impossible. Who knows? Okay, that's enough today. -Tomorrow at ten. -Ten in the morning? -Let's go to the Blue Note. -Or Katov's place? That's not a bad idea. It's not Monk. Do you like him? I dig him. He's not my style. Yeah, but he's my style. -You're starting too? -That guy kills me. He plays piano, speaks English, knows about jazz. Katov, I'm not strong enough. I'm finished. Come on! -I can't dance to this! -Come, it's easy! -Terrible! -Oh my! Look at Jimmy. -Where? -Too late. He kept looking at you. -Didn't you notice? -No. -He's very handsome. -He doesn't speak a word of French. So what? Jeanine! That's enough! Leave me the car keys. Go on. Make it, baby. Forget it. He's a pain. -She's got a nerve. -I don't think so. The guy's an idiot. Can't people be jealous? There's no such thing as jealousy. It's just another name for hurt pride. If you loved me and saw me with a man, you wouldn't care? Seeing you happy should make me suffer? Is that love? Yes. You think only of yourselves. It's indecent. You're mine. I'm yours. We're ours. What about respect for the individual? -Respect? -Naturally. In the name of love, we could stop eating, drinking or swimming. They're pleasures too. Oh my. What is it? He speaks Chinese too? I don't respect the individual. He says I won't let him eat, or swim… Help! I can't turn off the tap! It's overflowing! I know about taps. Help! No, thanks. There. You can get in. Shit, that's swell. It's cool. Shit, that's cool. Take me away, I'm begging you. Look. It's called Don Quixote. An allegory. Take me away. You know sometimes you dream, you want to wake up, but you can't. So in your dream, you go to bed so you can really wake up. I'd like to be in my bed and close my eyes. Your statue is very beautiful. Yes. Renaud! I've told you not to do that. They don't seem to like gruyère anyway. So what will you do with your million? -Have you got money issues? -No, I've hardly touched my inheritance. If we don't work, your inheritance will melt away. Is that it? No, I'm just asking you a question. I've invested my million. "Blue, color of blood. Red, love. Green, hate. White, sun of the insane. The rainbow is in our eyes." -What's that? -My investment. I bought Coco's poem for a million. I don't believe you. She's so stupid. Am I in the habit of lying? He is mad! -If I ever doubted, now I'm sure. -Really? He's mad! Completely mad! You should be locked up! You're mad! Stop or I'll start to believe it. I could have bought you a gift. Can you see me coming back with a fur coat? Look, wifey, this is for you. On the other hand, it's not enough to support you. You're way too rich. Would you like me to make money, for the principle? Yes, nothing could be easier. I'll write detective novels. I know the formula: a bit of sadism, mystery and sex. I'll write two a month. I know where to sell them. I don't want you to compromise yourself. That's so you. Compromise what? Me? Me nothing. There's nothing to compromise. Crime novels are less compromising than literature. Blast! Do you think I can't see what you're getting at? If it makes you happy, I can give you that. I need a table. This one is too small. -There is the desk. -No. I hate that living room. -We can bring the desk in here. -That desk? No, I need a flat table. Hey. Let's baptize it. Come on. On the shores of the Riviera Where a soft breeze blows Every woman has dreamed there… -Have you read this novel? -When it's finished. For now, I know no more than you do. I'm almost finished. I'm correcting it. You could work in Florence. There's no better inspiration than Tuscany in spring. I've rented an old monastery. The most beautiful thing. -Florence or Paris. -Or Caracas. -Or Livry-Gargan. -It's the same, I know. But I like Florence. I'll come pick you up at 7 a.m. tomorrow. Dressed or not, Renaud will go in the car. It's empty. There's a bottle in the desk in the bedroom. Coco died yesterday. I have his will. King Renaud comes back from war Carrying his guts in his hands His mother is in the tower She sees her son coming back Renaud, rejoice Your wife has given birth to a king Neither my wife nor my son Will make my heart rejoice CHAPTER 1 THE MARQUISE WENT OUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK Death is chasing me Mother, make a bed for me But make it downstairs So that my wife doesn't hear I won't sleep in it much At midnight I shall die And when midnight came King Renaud passed away -What time is it? -Not even 11 p.m. -It must be midnight somewhere. -Wherever you want. Midnight or not, I'm going home. I have to pack, we leave at dawn. Let's go, Raphaëlle. I know you. You won't wake up. -Haven't you had enough? -Enough of what? Of all this. -Of all this what? -Of all this! You should throw me out! What's the matter? Didn't you read my complete works? Tell me the truth. "Renaud, you're finished." -No! -"Renaud, you're finished!" -I want to hear you say it! -No! -Say it! -It's not true! I can't! I've had enough! Enough! Here! The Marquise went out at five o'clock. The Marquise went out at five! You don't give a damn about me! Get out! You're nice. But in the end, you can do nothing for me. You're useless. Your love, your charity, your pity… I've had it. I'm tired. Worn out, empty. Tonight, I'm 90 years old. Let's celebrate. Pour me a drink. Oh, right, you've broken everything. Sorry, that was silly. It doesn't matter. It can be fixed. Renaud. I haven't taken my toothbrush, don't panic. Bravo. Is he ready? -He's been out all night. -He's run away again? -He'll come back. -Some day. -Come in. -No, I can't. I must be in Florence tomorrow morning. I'm sorry, but I can't. Forget about him. Come. I know Renaud well. He's falling in love. Sometimes I think he hates me. The truth is that there are two Renauds. A Renaud who loves you and a Renaud who hates the one who loves you. He's fighting. He's afraid. He won't accept it. He's making you pay more dearly. I don't know how far he can go. Are you brave enough to get through to the end? The very end? I can't do otherwise. Hello? -Chief. -Thanks. -Yes? -I'm bringing Mr. Sarti's papers. -He lives with you? -Yes. -Are you a relative? -No. We'll give you back your lovebird. He was drunk as a lord. Luckily for him, or else you might never have seen him again. This isn't a jail, it's a fish tank. His manners are enough to make a whore blush. You were lucky it was me, you bastard. But don't come back. She's not prude, that chick. I think I love you. It's horrible. That's enough, damn it! I didn't ask you anything! Sorry, that song reminds me of something. The war. Come on, le'ts go. We can never say anything. You women are all the same. I don't know why I let myself do that. It messed up the day. That poor guitarist. It's your fault. What does he want, this one? Damn it. I've spotted the bar. Vino! Here is Saint Geneviève. Come on, after you. -Goodnight, then. -Goodnight. I see the woman of my life. Her heart is shining and she's thirsty. How are you? I like you a lot! I like you! A little bit of wine, it's good! -What's wrong with my hands? -You have beautiful hands. Stop. You can't stand up straight. Cheers, son. Too beautiful for this night. Okay, but I want to see first. She's asking for 10 000 lire. She's worth it, isn't she? Let's go. You can't do this to me. You've no right. I'm bored with love tonight. It's my right. I want a whore. It's my right. You really want a whore? You will always be a charming nice lady. A nice girl doesn't sell herself. She loves. Or if needed she buys. Here. I'm cold. Decide, quickly. Who is it? -Renaud is not here? -No. -Where are you going? -To make coffee. You need it. In Paris you said you were ready to get through to the end. To the very end. With Renaud, there is no end. There never will be. You learned to love him. You can learn to forget him. I don't want to. Earlier, in front of those girls, it was as if something had changed, in a second. You know? Like when you're a child and you draw a house in the sand. You say, "That's the door", and you're outside. I love him. I'm not the same anymore. He pushed me out. And if he comes back? I don't know. The sun! You will go on? I love him. But I know it will never be the same again. It's like giving birth. As if now I have the strength to live for myself. To act for myself. To love for myself. I'm unhappy. Katov! It's Hotel San Michele in Florence! No! That's enough! He spent 120,000 lire in three days. He's going too far. I'm not paying. He can go to hell! Know Renaud Sarti? Thank God for it. This animal has been drinking all over Tuscany and sending me the bills. That's the fifth call. It's not a bill, it's baron Avenzo. Oh, well. Renaud will turn up one day, when we least expect it. Here or elsewhere. What's the difference? -Are you still in his garden? -Yes. But I've closed the gate. The cloud garden. One day you'll blow on it and it'll disappear. Blowing isn't playing. You talk like him. -I've had enough, Katov. Can I move? -Yes. I've broken a cup! A cup? My Venus! Vandal! You've never been so beautiful. If someone told me three days ago I could live without Renaud, I would have screamed. Scream! Are you cured? Of Renaud? No. On the contrary. I understand him better than ever. But I'm me, you see. And it feels wonderful. Daddy! Renaud Sarti! Look at him. There's nothing more to say. Sire, I thought you were dead. Or mad? I'm both. Where is the manager of the mad house? He says, "piss off". Is he angry? Let's go, then. The horses are ready. Is he really angry? I forgive him. Where's the Girl Scout? The Florentine angel? Where's St. Bernard? -She's here? -Yes. -Where is she? -Leave her alone. How could I? I have nothing to give. She's stolen everything. Look, I'm a wreck. Leave her alone. She's injected her love like a virus. I'm bleeding, Katov. I've filled my veins with liquor for three days. A complete transfusion. There's nothing I can do. I'm still bleeding. Where is she? You see, Katov, I have four solutions. Laugh. It doesn't work. Melodrama. Jump out waving a couple of revolvers. No, it would end in vaudeville. Suicide. Too dangerous. You never know how it ends. And I've tried it already. Or suffer in silence. It has some greatness. -But it's rather mundane. -What will you choose? Emptiness. Emptiness through whisky. A complete transfusion. Let's have a drink. I've been looking for you all night! I give in! I surrender! I've had it! I quit! I'm tired. I want to rest. Take me prisoner. Take me. Pick me, I'm on the floor. Handcuff me! I don't want freedom! Freedom for nothing! I want to be part of the human race. That nasty human race. Marry me! Marry me. Marry me! Don't let me go. Force me to live, that's all I ask you. I mean it, I swear. Marry me. Subtitle translation by: Stephane Versini
