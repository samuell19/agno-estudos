[bats squeaking] [mellow creepy music] He's not going to be happy. Don't worry about that, I can handle Mr. Travis. There are just a few things you need to be aware of. What are they? Well, you know how billionaire geniuses tend to be eccentric. Not from personal experience, but I'll use it as an operating principle. Well, if there happens to be a dwarf or a clown in there, don't be alarmed. Dwarf or clown. Okay. And don't be surprised if there are some girls playing music in a cage. They're his private rock band. They're pretty talented, actually. So why are they in a cage? Oh, and don't be surprised at the mask. The mask? Yes, Mr. Travis always wears a mask. Why? Well, if you feel inclined, you can ask him. Is that you Cindy darling? Yes, Mr. Travis. Ms. Agami, Mr. Loftus, please come in. Thank you. [strange music] [children chattering] Nice to see you again Ms. Agami. Nice to see you, Mr. Mascaro. I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. Don't! I'm not a dog you know. Yeah, sorry. How're you doin' girls? [bickering in cage] Hey girls. How're you doin'? Hi Ms. Agami. Don't fuck with me you bitch. How you doin' Razor Baby, Cotton Baby, Black Baby? Shirley. Good morning Ms. Agami. I do believe Mr. Travis has a little surprise for you. Oh Shirley, I don't think Mr. Travis can surprise me anymore. I betcha he can. Please, don't let me interrupt you crazy kids. [giggling] When do they start biting the heads off chickens? You think they don't? Cindy my dear, come on over here and bring your charming young friend. This way please. It's good to see you again, Mr. Travis. I detect a note of irony in your voice, Cindy dear. Howard isn't it? Don't worry, I won't ask you to shake. Please. These are my new, oh one moment please. Hylas, my boy. Some music. Selection number three, I think. Number three! Play, play!

Some dolls. Have a look. My, how racist. It's surprising how even rudeness can be pleasant coming from an attractive woman. I am of course racist, but an equal opportunity one. It's charming. It's strange but they look very familiar. Do they? Well enough of this. Etiquette requires some polite conversation before getting down to business. Said obligation has, I think, been discharged. I must now inform you that I am extremely displeased. I do not like reading about myself in the papers, especially when my name is coupled with the phrase billion dollar loss. If you wanna blame someone, blame the judge, blame the federal prosecutor. I make no excuses. I accept none. As for the judge and the prosecutor have no worries. As a good business man, I always balance my books, always. Mr. Travis sir, I can understand how upset-- Really? And how could you understand? Have you ever lost a billion dollars to the ineptitude of a pair of overpriced shysters? Please don't answer, it's a rhetorical question. That's not at all fair. Indeed. Well, no one ever claimed that life was fair. And certainly no one ever claimed that I was. [clanking, whirring] What the hell? Mr. Travis, what do you think you're doing? Your failure compels me to take direct action to remedy this dire situation. You leave me no choice. This is crazy. Let us out of these things. Three competitors are responsible for this situation. Don't know that. No, you don't know it, I do. Mercy Shaw, George Warbeck, and most importantly, Harrison Yulin. Through their devious and underhanded imaginations they have orchestrated this financial catastrophe, this veritable holocaust of corporate destruction. Bringing me to the verge of financial ruin. I relied upon you to stop them. You have failed. Now one of you is going to assist me. Mr. Travis, you're not asking us to do anything illegal. Well actually, I only need one of you. Now which one of these chairs had that little extra built in? Well I just can't quite remember. Let's find out. [suspenseful music] [whirring] No! No, no, no! No! [screaming] Volume up please Hylas. Volume up. [screaming] [music gets louder] [screaming drowns out lyrics] [gurgling] Well, I don't suppose there's any more need for secrets between us. Close your mouth, Cindy dear, it's rude. I've never spoken to you about my mother, Eugenia, have I? She's a remarkable woman. All together ahead of her time in so many different ways, including genetic engineering. You see, she made me. I'm perhaps her most perfect creation. Although not as you can see altogether perfect. What do you want? What do I want? A very good question, Cindy my dear. I've searched high and low for answers to that question, but I have yet to find any that speak to my peculiar circumstances. I have thus been forced to make my own way. Your incompetence has put all of this in jeopardy. Now I must insist that you make it right. But I think it's time to end this pleasant conversation and proceed with the matter of your assistance. Mr. Mascaro? If you please. [crying] No. [creepy music] I take it you're familiar with the iron maiden? This is crazy. This is crazy! Well, this is rather different, though it does share some qualities in common, but it's designed not to transfix victims so much as to compress them. I can only judge from the reactions of the previous occupants that it is a rather painful process. Oh, by the way, you mentioned the federal prosecutor, Mr. Averill, and the judge, the honorable negro Arthur Morton. They'd be able to describe the process to you, if they could still speak. You could ask them. [creepy laugh] [growling] [screaming] Mr. Mascaro, let's begin the sequence. [screaming] [electricity zapping] No, no, no! Hylas, selection number seven please. No! [crying] Play!

Travis's billion dollar loss is our billion dollar gain, Mr. Harrison Yulin. [glass clinking] God damn, I'll drink to that alright. Drink to myself. You must be very proud of your husband, Mrs. Yulin. There aren't many men who could accomplish what my Harrison has. Of course I'm proud of him. Well it was the smoothest bit of corporate rogering I've ever witnessed. I only wish I could see Virgil Travis's face right now. Well, from what I hear, nobody ever has. Oh, he must be shy, or maybe ugly. He sounds like an idiot. Yes, I know. It's a masterful disguise. That man is the most brilliant business man in the entire world, excepting myself. My only mistake was underestimating him. Harrison, I wanna talk to you about this merger. The what? No, no, not tonight, we've all had a busy day and my husband needs his sleep. Tomorrow will be soon enough. Moira, no one that I know could kick guests out into the cold with more charm. You're right of course, I think it's time we headed on home. How unfortunate, now they'll go to their bedroom. I've never been able to monitor what goes on in there. Why not? I'm not sure. Countermeasures of some kind. If he can keep you from listening upstairs, why not downstairs? I have asked myself this question, and no answer is forthcoming. I suspect that there is some subtlety involved. In any case it's a moot point. Secrets are best kept in the grave, and Mr. Yulin may keep his there, along with the other two. And with the evil assistance of my new creations, and yours as well Mr. Mascaro. Ah. I shall have my cookie after all. How many times have I told you to turn on the jamming devises when you come in here? The what? The jamming devices! Sorry, sorry, hmm, hmm, now honey, now honey, I mean mistress, hmm, hmm, ow, ow. Try to pay attention. Yes, yes, yes. Shut up! Keep kissing and listen. Yes. [smooching] Those idiots think that we checkmated Virgil Travis, but I know better, he's still in the game. But, but you said the ruling was appeal proof. Ow! It was appeal proof because we bought the judge and the federal prosecutor. If you ever bothered to read the paper, you'd have noticed that they both disappeared within the last 72 hours. Vacation? Ow! Hardly. Travis has clearly opted for the direct approach. He's had them murdered. Murdered, you're kidding me. Do I sound as if I'm joking? Now I must reevaluate him. Clearly he's an audacious player. Shoot, you really think that? I mean, hmm, hmm, I mean, mistress, I mean Travis may be a bit eccentric, but shoot, you really think he'd go and hmm, murder people? Why not? We've had people murdered. What? We have? Who? Harrison, do you really wanna know? I, I, I, I. Shut up, Harrison! Now Virgil Travis is going to try to eliminate all of us, which if we're careful, we might find useful. Warbeck and Shaw were necessary but inevitably expendable, not worth the risk for us to eliminate them, but if Virgil Travis wants to do it for us, all the better. Pay attention. Ow! Yes! And just you remember, little Harry, who has the brains in this outfit. Yes, mistress. Keep kissing. [metal crashing] Jesus, doesn't that hurt? Eat me. In your fuckin' dreams. [growling, grunting] Cut it out now. Quit foolin' around. Why them? I've always come through for you. Now, now, no jealousy. Don't think of them as competitors, think of them as new weapons. Come to know them. Come to love them. They'll kill for you, for us. Who's first, Yulin? No, a man of his intelligence will know what I intend. One of the others. It really doesn't matter which is first. Um, you'll need a disguise. No problem. [suspenseful music] [beeping, clicking] [weights clanking] [laughter] Hey kid, why don't you get your face out of the comic book and start paying attention to the monitor, got it? Damn.

They will suspect us and take additional precautions. This will require further cogitation. I'm resolved in this matter, Mr. Mascaro, I'm not rash. [whirring, chirping] I'm not interested in talking about a merger, not after what they did to Warbeck. Well you know what they say, life goes on. Yeah, that's exactly the point. I intend for my life to go on. Don't think I follow you. Honest to god, Harrison, sometimes I don't know what to make of you. You don't actually believe that fairy tale about a gay drifter, do you? I mean, come on, Warbeck was about a heterosexual as a Kennedy. As who? Ask her what she's planning to do. Kennedy, I said. Well, what is it you plan on doing, Mercy? Planning on leaving town tonight and I'm not telling a living soul where I'm going. Mm-hmm, kinda hard to do business that way. Oh to hell with the business. You know, I've always been in it for the money anyway, not the ego. I've already made more than I can spend in this lifetime. It's not worth risking my life for. Huh? Look, Warbeck's out, so am I. Tell her it's not so easy to back out. Well, it may not be so easy to back out. Are you threatening me, Harrison? Huh? No, I'm not the one to be afraid of. No, I'm not the one to be afraid of, no sir, not me. Fine alright, you wanna buy me out? Go ahead. Call my attorney, I'll be in touch with him. Price. Price? I don't know. I don't know, Christ. I mean, you heard what happened to Warbeck and his guards. Look, I can't even think about it right now. Just make me an offer through my attorney, okay? Goodbye Harrison. Best of luck. Best of luck, honey. Get upstairs you miserable, ignorant wretch, Okay, coming up, mm-hmm. Quiet you idiot. You still want to kill her? Hmm, of course. This is as much a matter of pride as profit. Won't be easy. One moment please, Mr. Mascaro. I just wanna listen to that last little bit again. Okay, coming up, mm-hmm. Coming up. That's a funny thing for him to say. What's coming up? Anybody, mm-hmm, I mean mistress. Sit down. Where? On the floor! We gonna watch a little movie, mm-hmm? Shut up, Harrison. If you keep talking, I'll have to punish you and I just don't have the time right now. This is a download from the audio/video bug in Warbeck's house. How'd we get a bug in Warbeck's house? There is no we, Harrison, there's only me, and a sloppy man -shaped appendage, you. I placed the bug in Warbeck's house when we went there for Christmas. It takes one image ever five seconds, downloads automatically at intervals. None of this means anything to you of course. The killing took place sometime after midnight. There. The gymnasium is at the end of this hall, that's where he was going. So now he and Warbeck are being killed, so let's jump ahead a few moments. I saw something. Do tell. What the hell? They look like dolls. What the hell? [creepy music] [girls chattering] Coming up, coming up. What could he mean by that? Mr. Travis, what about the woman? Hmm? The woman. Mercy Shaw. She's leaving tonight. Oh yes, kill her, would you? I'll leave the manner in your hands. [growling] Hey guys, quit screwing around, we've got work to do. Play 'em, Hylas. Number four!

Mistress. I mean mistress, mm -hmm, how do you-- Ow! That's for being stupid. I know that your office downstairs is bugged somehow, that's how Virgil Travis knows of her intention to run. He'll send his dolls out to kill her before the end of the night. All for the better, really. Now the only loose end is him. Find and dandy, mm-hmm, but how do you keep 'em from doing the same thing to us? Us? Ow! Don't you mean you? In Virgil Travis's war, I'm just a civilian. Huh, that's an interesting thought. At any rate, if he tries to send his dolls in here, he'll have a rather unpleasant surprise. Like what? Ow! I've taken steps. That means that unless he has access to a cruise missile, we're untouchable. Unfortunately I can't get him in that fortress he's in. Stale mate? Oh! That is a word I told you never to use. When force fails, one must rely upon finesse, and in this area there's no doubt, I have the edge. Is there anything in this world more pathetic than a man? I think not. Ow! [dolls grunting] [dolls screaming] [alarm sounding] Hey, hey, hey, what's that? Is that an alarm over there? My, sooner than I thought. Dear Virgil is impatient. Is that a fire over there? Just a little mouse trap, that's all. It's them doll things, isn't it? Yes. Now don't fret Harry, everything's gonna be fine. I've got it all worked out. Tomorrow I'm gonna pay a visit to Mr. Virgil Travis and everything's going to be fine. You, hmm. Travis don't see nobody. Why would he see you, hmm? Why? Because I'm the gentle innocent wife of his most brilliant competitor. Go to sleep little Harry, mommy needs her beauty rest. [sniveling] He doesn't look too good. He's toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Toasted. Please girls, please. A little compassion for our diminutive friend. [sniveling] [growling] Now, now, be brave. After Darkie here ran into that fire trap we did a creep-through on the whole perimeter. There's no way in, unless we do a full-scale mercenary thing. You think Yulin wouldn't have prepared against that contingency as well? What height above ground were the flame throwers? Eight inches, give or take. Aimed straight across, not up. You have read my mind, Mr. Mascaro. This defense was clearly installed with our friends here in mind. How unfortunate. Still, I should have guessed that Yulin would learn the truth. Once again I've underestimated him. [phone ringing] Yeah. No, go ahead. What's that? Where is she? Did you search her? Guess who's waiting in the sitting room? You know I detest guessing games, Mr. Mascaro. Mrs. Yulin. What? Yulin's wife. See. What in the world? What's the meaning of this? Ms. Yulin. Mr. Travis? Speaking. I'd like to speak with you. Proceed. I mean to say I'd like to meet with you. Why? Please? I shall be down momentarily. Should I have her searched? I studied body language Mr. Mascaro, that's hardly a woman bent on a suicide mission. However there is one much more important thing that you can do for me. What's that? Locate the vehicle that brought her here. Ms. Yulin. Mr. Travis. I don't usually meet people face to face, if you'll pardon the expression. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. May I fetch you a drink? Yes please, brandy. No questions about the mask? Course not. Such a question would be discourteous. In any case, I'm more interested in the man underneath the mask. Indeed. Thank you. Please. Ms. Yulin, life to me is largely a matter of calculation, but you are a term I had not previously considered. And knowing and admiring your husband as I do, I can hardly believe that your presence here is not a part of some larger plan. You admire my husband? Most people think he's a buffoon. Yes, but, but you and I know better. I've seen his ineffable mark on a hundred business ventures, a dozen assassinations. Does that shock you? I know the sort of man my husband is. He's clear and resolute. A man of power and vision. That's why I married him. That's why I love him. Your husband didn't send you here at all, you came on your own. Yes. Why, to beg for mercy? To ask for an armistice. I understand that this is a battle for dominance, but in that battle both might fall, you know this. I see now that your husband has a most valuable asset that I had not at all considered. He knows about the dolls. Yes, I'm aware of that. Mr. Travis, I know that I can't out-reason you. I can't win a war of words or any other kind of war with you, but great men must have great hearts. Tell me then, how do I reach your heart? How do I stop this? I'm afraid that you're mistaken about the size of my heart. I'm not at all what you think. What are you then? I am nothing. What? I said that I am nothing. I am an emptiness and like all emptiness I struggle perpetually to be filled. I draw in wealth, power, sensation, but still I am empty. Still I am nothing. Take care Ms. Yulin, lest you be sucked in as well. Have you ever heard of a man named Honore DeLesseps? A French philosopher, wasn't he? Yes. He once said that if you crave power then love nothing, not even your own life, because to love a thing is to give it your power. He also said that love was desire satisfied and hatred desire unsatisfied. Sorry, that sounds better in French. What do you desire Mr. Travis? What I desire, Ms. Yulin, is my own concern. Now listen carefully, I promise nothing regarding your husband, that's between us, but so long as you do not become a weapon against me you will not be harmed. Why Mr. Travis? Why this concern for me? Ms. Yulin, there are so few truly excellent things in this world, we must try to preserve them when we can. Now go. They're on board. Mr. Travis, they're on-- I heard you the first time, Mr. Mascaro. I'll go after them in a few minutes. Pick them up after the kill. No. Leave now. But-- Now. Some music Hylas. Number 10. Number 10.

I knew there was a screw loose there. Oh, ooh. He's the most brilliant man I've ever met. Most people I've got figured in five seconds, but Virgil Travis, I'm still trying to work him out. Perhaps he's deformed in some way. Even still, the way he acted toward me, his body was, I could've sworn-- Old boy was hot for you, huh? Shut up you moron! No! Not lust, I know that well enough, no. He was almost courtly. Who would've ever dreamed that Virgil Travis, of all people, was secretly a romantic? I think he was smitten with me. I don't know if it's more amusing or pathetic. I, hmm, I still don't get why you went over there anyhow. Hmm, how's it going to help us? There you go, using that word again, us. Make it tighter, mistress. Be quiet. Harry, in every relationship there's a moment of truth. Darling using you for a living ventriloquist dummy has had its advantages, but I suppose this was inevitable. What's that honey? Don't fret, you've already signed all the necessary documents for transition of power. Ooh! It should be a smooth one. What, what's that honey? Come on now, what're you talking about honey-bunny?

Harrison's dead, they killed him. Ms. Yulin, uh-- And now they're after me. What are you saying? You told me I wouldn't be harmed, you lied to me! You used me, didn't you? No, no, I didn't lie, they was sent for your husband, not you. Liar, you're a liar. You're a monster. [gasps] They're outside the door! They're breaking in! Moira run, run from them! Oh God help me! Leave her alone. I order you, leave her alone. I created you. Leave her alone! [tape rewinding] Moira run, run from them. Leave her alone. I order you, leave her alone. I created you. Leave her alone! [exhales] Yes Virgil hello. Ms. Yulin. For now with my poor husband being dead, I think I'll resume my maiden name. Deray, as in Gilles De Re. Perhaps you've heard of him. I believe I've read the record of his trial. Well my dear masked man, unless you want to be reading the record of your own trial, I think it that a rapprochement will be essential. Really? A good player always knows when the game is over, Virgil. If I may be so bold, I have a video taped record of the killing of my poor husband, your tape recorded confession and your very interesting little dolls. Oh and by the way, I also have a tape of those same dolls at the house of the dear departed Mr. Warbeck. Coming up. What's that? You had your husband wired. I heard him speaking to you. I should've realized it. It was you. All along it was you. And even when I met you I never suspected it. I thought you were-- You that what I wanted you to think, that I was a nervous desperate little wife. Yes. I was a fool. You're a romantic, which I supposed amounts to the same thing, I hope I didn't break your heart. Oh yeah that's right, I forgot, you don't have one. I remember making that claim. Now Virgil. I must ask your pardon. I can't speak right now. I'll be in touch with you soon. I, I, I cannot speak anymore right now. [dolls grunting] The pit yawns before me. I, of all living creatures, can't permit myself no illusion of a soul. It's from emptiness that I came and that emptiness awaits me at the end. And what dwells between but a mad, pointless puppet show, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Yeah, I hear you man. How easy it would be. Sure would. Just one little squish. I actually had tender thoughts toward her. I even imagined what it might be like to love her. But it was a sham, pretense. She used me. She used me! She outwitted me! No. No, we'll leave death in the waiting room a while longer I think. A man who loves nothing may do anything. So let her see what can be done with this woman. Hylas! [clanking] Play 'em. Number one. Play! [screaming] Play! Play number one! I don't suppose you eat, do you? Well it doesn't really matter whether I return you alive or dead. You three are, how shall I put this? Pawns in this game. Odd little pawns admittedly, but pawns nonetheless. I suspect your master has had a sleepless night. He's been thinking, plotting revenge against me. I told him that the game was over, but of course we both know that's not the case. He'll expect demands but I'm going to surprise him. Men have never realized that for a woman's surrender is just another way of winning. In the end he'll be no different from poor Harry. By the time I'm done with him, there won't be anything left. [phone ringing] Hello Virgil. A meeting? Of course. No, no, a public place isn't necessary, I'll come over if that would be acceptable to you. Virgil? Yes, yes, that will be fine. I look forward to seeing you. She doesn't wanna meet in a public place. So the ambush is off. Yes. No. She's coming here. That's convenient. Yes, but why is she making it convenient for me? Is this more subtlety or mere brashness? Does it matter? I don't know. That's what has me worried. [doorbell rings] Good evening Ms. Deray. [laughter] Explain. Why I'm placing myself in your power? Yes. There are so few truly excellent things in this world that we must try to preserve them when we can. And should I be moved to preserve you? Or do you suggest that you wish to preserve me? A plea for mercy or a veiled threat? Your dolls. The tape of the killing. The cassette tape of your confession. The tape showing the dolls at Warbeck's. And this. And what are these? I am signing over to you for the sum of $1.00 the total assets of my late husband's companies. I've also signed a confession admitting that I killed Harrison myself and undertook to frame you by means and methods consistent with the tapes. There are no copies of the tapes, by the way, but you could hardly be sure of this, this obviates the need to be sure. Why are you doing this? Do you hope to prevent your death in this way? No Virgil. If a man of wealth and means desires the death of another with sufficient fervor, then that person must die. My death is yours if you want it. But I can give you something more, something you cannot take, something only I can give. And what is that? Me. My life. I knew the first time we met that you had feelings for me. Feelings, yes. But what I wanted then you cannot give me. What you showed me then was a creature of grace and gentleness, but that was mere artifice. You see, even we who are destined to dwell in the mud can still long for the sky. And what do you see when you look in the sky, Virgil? Nothing. Emptiness. Life is down here with all the lying and killing and fucking. If I were a man you would have to kill me because nothing could make you trust me. But I'm a woman. A young woman. The wounds of nations are healed in the bedchambers of kings. You will be able to trust me implicitly when I am the mother of your children. So you are proposing a dynasty. And what about this? It's irrelevant. Remember Virgil, I gave my body to an idiot for ten years in order to further my ambitions. I doubt that you could be worse. No worse than an idiot. There's a mighty foundation upon which to build a marriage. Virgil, you are the most brilliant man I have ever known. And I am the most brilliant woman I have ever known. We are both too intelligent to believe in a life beyond this one. Whatever immortality we can hope for must be procreative. There's no other woman in the world for you except me. Your pride compels you to kill me, master me instead. Take me, use me. If I die, what can you hope for different from what you've had? But together think of what we can do. The power, the glory. We can be lords of the earth. I've had this prepared, it's a marriage license. I've took the liberty of forging your signature. Don't worry though, it's indistinguishable from your own. Indeed it is. Another skill. I have talents you haven't even dreamed of. Virgil we are both, how shall I put this? Very busy people. If you're going to kill me, then let's get on with it. I have nothing more to say. But if not, give me the dollar and find a justice of the peace. I'm afraid I don't carry cash. Mr. Mascaro? Sorry Mr. Travis, I've only got 50s. Ah, Hylas, thank you. You are now the proud owner of my fortune. And me. And you needn't worry about a justice of the peace, Mr. Mascaro is an ordained minister. You're joking. Officially Mr. Mascaro is my religious advisor. Church of the Diving Spirit. I'm in McAlister registry of religions. Most convenient at tax time. I see. Well then, I see no reason to wait. No, let us proceed at once. Move the fuck over. Do you Virgil Travis take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. Do you Moira Yulin, err Deray, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Then by the power vested in me by the divine spirit, that totally permeates the whole universe, wheresoever you may go you cannot get away from it. I declare you to be husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Yes, I think so. After all, as you said, such matters are irrelevant to the founding of a dynasty. Let us kiss. And more than kiss, let us proceed with your procreative ambitions. [gasps] What's the matter my dear? Don't tell me that you're afraid to play in this particular patch of mud. There is, after all, no woman in the world for me except for you. Embrace me then my angel, my love. Press your sweet gentle lips against mine. [screaming] I'm sorry if the face beneath the mask was not what you expected. But then the face beneath your mask was rather a disappointment to me as well. You see, by giving me a glimpse of love, something I never imagined I could experience, and then ripping it away, it managed to convince me of something that I've long suspected. My life gives me no more pleasure, and when a thing ceases to please me, I rid myself of it. What did he say? Shh! My domain is now being sealed and flooded with toxic gas. I'm with you boss. Hell, here we come. Me too boss. Well that's not good. Excuse me, what about us? This is definitely not good. Just to satisfy your curiosity, I am not a man nor a woman born. [screams] My mother, dear woman, grew me in a bottle. A technique she devised, though clearly failed to perfect. Prospect of a dynasty of living [mumbles] such as myself holds no charm. [screaming] Virgil please, I, I. So I've managed to make a woman speechless. Well then, perhaps the whole thing was worth while after all. Man, what a bummer. Hey, Ninja Baby, we owe you one. [coughing] Maybe we ought to leave now. That sounds great. Boss! The girls! Oh Hylas. Fuck you! The door's locked. [panicking] We can't get out! Stop, he has a grenade! [coughing] Hey, look it's the little guys. Hurry! Come on, hurry up. Everybody ready? [cheering] One moment please ladies and gentlemen, and boys and girls. By all rights we should be showing the end credits right now, but we have a bit of an awkward problem. You see we came up with two endings for this story and we couldn't decide between them. What you just saw a minute ago, that's one. Moira is tortured, the girls and the dolls get away and the rest of us all die. Okay, I can see the cynical appeal. But being as I am a fundamentally spiritual person, I prefer the following rather different ending to our proceedings. Little prick. We're gonna get you now. Oh Hylas, fuck you! Oh Hylas, you play some music now. [girls chattering] [gun firing] [screaming] That's enough of that! Show a little protocol, a little spirituality. Behave yourselves. Take a lesson from my little friends over there. Hey, knock it off! This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Anybody make it not so happy, then I'm not gonna be happy. Do I make myself clear? Do I? Play, Hylas. Right. Play Hylas. Recessional, play! [wedding march] Stop! Do you Virgil Travis take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. And do you Moira Yulin, err Deray, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. That's all I need. Then by the power vested in me by the divine spirit, that totally permeated the entire universe, wheresoever you be you may not get away from it, I declare you to be husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Yes, I think so. After all, as you said, such matters are irrelevant to the founding of a dynasty. So my dear, let us kiss. [gasps] What's the matter my dear? Don't tell me that I disappoint you. That I disgust you, this thing that I am. Disgust me? How could you do that? What? Virgil, I can't lie to you. I wanted to despise you and dominate you because I thought you were just a man, and men are only worthy of being despised and dominated, but now I know the truth. You're more than a man. Virgil, I never believed it could be possible, but I actually. What? Virgil, don't you see? We're both marvels and we're both monsters. Believe me, I know it now. We were meant for one another. I don't know what to say. Virgil, I love you. Because you're a monster and because you're more than a man. I love you. Virgil, my Virgil.
