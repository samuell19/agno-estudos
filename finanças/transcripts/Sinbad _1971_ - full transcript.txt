Take your master home... Well, it looks like the end of him. You may go back to your lover now, to Terka. Fm not going to bother with your funeral. Perhaps I have been everywhere. To dances, at funerals, in forests, on shores, in sin and virtue. We travelled a lot. But I got tired. Starring Screenplay based on short stories by Gyula Krfldy Written by Zoltén Huszérik Music Director of Photography Director May the golden chains of freedom Tie our hearts together My ladies... I'm a lost prince and I'm looking for a wife. - What's your name? - Duskie. Odd. You'll remember me at dusk... even if you don't see me again. Tell me your name again so that I shall never forget it. When the moon drives her yellow donkeys to the river, I'll come to you. Men can see me only at dusk. The hand of the clock is nearing 12. And I'm thinking of you. If you did not shine for me, my star, I would no longer wish to go on living. The hand of the clock is nearing 12. And I'm thinking of you. h' you did not shine for me, my star... ...I would no longer wish to go on living. I wonder if the flowers in the little garden where we met are still white? My darling, my love, my betrothed. - Poor little dove. - I love you. I am suffering deeply for you, my lady. My secret bliss should be as soundless as a fragrance. It should shine like a star on a clear night. Silent moon, cast your amiable eye on me, While my dreamy eyes shed tears for you, girl. Oh, do forget me and feel no guilt. Get married. You are indeed a rose in full bloom. No, Szindbéd, no! Why is it that women love the sea? Are you looking for my husband? My husband? Strange. You look so familiar. I swear I wasn't expecting you. I didn't even know that you were still alive. What brought you here? My God, what a coincidence. I never think of you. Why should I? Well, how are you, Szindbéd? Why do you want to see my husband? I suffer from insomnia and I forgot to bring any morphine with me. And you happened to ring our bell? There are many other doctors in town. My husband is only a kind of peasant doctor. But we make a living. There are only the two of us and I'm not extravagant. But you know me. Even as a girl I used to wear my old hats. Yes, I remember. We are quite happy. Ifs very quiet around here. On summer evenings we sit under the poplar tree and I listen to its sounds. The poplar tree is my most faithful old admirer. You used to like the theatre and the balls. Believe me, we are very happy. Are you leaving already? Aren't you going to wait for my husband? I only came to see you. Are you going? Yet... - Come... come... - It's nothing. I just thought you wanted to see my husband. Or maybe you'd say something... I used to believe you. There was something in your voice that used to soothe me, that made me happy when I was sad. Why did you tell me you loved someone else? I have to take spoonfuls of medicine so that I can sleep. But all the rest I said is true. I have one ring, this green one. Tell me, have you ever thought of me? I have, many times. Always. You kept me waiting ten years. How often have I seen you in my dreams, how many times have I hoped to see you again, just once again. Whenever we went to Budapest, I looked for you everywhere, but I never, never saw you. Yet, if you had thought or dreamt of me, you would have come. Szindbad, you were just as deceitful as always. My husband. You're not leaving town yet? We'll see each other again, won't we? Queen Majmunka. You scoundrel! You dare to show your face again? I'll murder you, that's all I can do with you. I've been crying over you for three days. I found out that you and that ugly Imola, whose hair is like cobwebs, a woman I had to support with food and drink in that horrible prison... You and that woman... I'll kill you! I can't bear such disgrace! The whole house is talking about you and Imola. And everyone asks in amazement, "Are you still alive, Szindbéd?" I swear, not a single word of... Silence. It's too late. You're going to die. Young women only corrupt you. One can learn nothing from them, just sensitivity which one has no need for. I can see you're hungry. I have cooked chicken soup. Yes, but you forgot the marjoram, my rose! I know where your heart lies. Even when you loved me you were fussy. You could at least have been unfaithful with a beautiful young girl. But to disgrace me with an old woman. That's too much to bear. My uncle often used to tell me when I was a boy, a real man can happily love even his great-grandmother. Now, if I were to love ugly, old women like your friend Imola, how could I possibly be loved by a beautiful, young woman like you? Majmunka. My queen. You should be proud of your lover. You win, scoundrel. You're my last love, Szindbéd. Is this really the end of the glorious life I spent at Fanny's side? I WISH YOU A HAPPY 1873 This was the farewell letter from the man who loved me most. We'll read it when we are in the country. We'll go to a little Polish resort, as I did with my first husband, and then we'll travel all over the world. Szindbéd, I'll elope with you into a wonderful, rich life. I wonder if Fanny knows that I may leave the capital forever. We'll spend summer in the country. I'll talk to our lime trees, our horses and cats... - Won't that be nice, Szindbéd? - It will be lovely. I'm a sentimental woman. I can cure the trees. The swallow on the roof recognises me. I bequeathed a large sum to our church in my will. Since meeting you, I've altered my will. Everything belongs to you. And I have quite a fortune. We'll also visit my poor uncle's grave. What a kind, distinguished face he has in his picture. And how he loved me. He forgave me everything. We shall never leave each other again. We shall never part again, will we? We shall never leave each other again. When everyone deserted me, I felt that my life, my beauty, my love had come to an end. My dead mother stretched out her hand to me and said, "Today you'll see him." So I decided to put on my best dress, the one I'd made when we first met. I so wanted to please you. Nonsense. Forgive me, Szindbéd, for speaking of trifling matters. I set out as if I knew the way to you, as though I was following myself in the twilight. Instinct led me towards the Danube... How far did I walk? I don't remember. Time is all a blur. Suddenly, I heard the voice of a policeman beside me. He told me not to commit suicide. He said I could still have a happy life. Happy, happy» When we looked happily at each other with love still afresh, when our life was as happy as the birds', when our kisses never ended, when we got carried away and believed we were the chosen ones, the only lovers, God's children, souls of the sun or the moon, you promised that we would die together. Shall we die? Come to my home! The house is empty. I shall bid farewell to my mother's portrait, you'll kill me silently, so that I can see you until my dying moment. I know you'll come with me. You won't leave me alone in the great unknown. I'll follow you. If we were to stay alive we'd part again, cry again, sob after each other, we'd suffer immeasurably and who knows if we'd meet again and love one another as we deserve. Love... We are going to die, Szindbéd. The sun may rise again without us, we shall never see daybreak again. But day is breaking. Really? I cannot die in daylight. The milkman comes, my husband arrives on the first train. The postman brings an invitation to my friend. In summer we'll move to the country and the afternoon I shall go and visit my brother in hospital. Some other time, Szindbéd. Another time, when we meet again, one night. Everybody must start life anew, from the beginning. Naked. Perhaps in order not to be scared of the things which await us. The acacia tree knows when to bloom twice, the frog, the mouse sense forthcoming changes in the weather. Only man with his head held high cannot foresee tomorrow. You know, sir, it's not worth living for anything else but women. My all... She pretends to be a Russian princess with a line of Pushkin embroidered on her garter. You still seem to be interested in loose girls. - I'm fed up with heart chasers. - I don't understand you. You bring these dancers over to me and then you're cross if I'm not rude to them. And yet I would have expected you to be rude to them. You have to behave respectably here. You're a fool, my darling. I've never loved anybody but my vanity, my pride and I believed that I was superior. I wonder who loves Fruzsina now? Where have her butterfly shoes taken her'? I always loved you. Even now you're thinking of someone else. I always knew when you loved me, who you loved and for how long. I had time to think it over. Here is this little notebook. I used to write down everything I didn't want to forget. Let me see... 21 July 1900. A ride at 2:00 pm behind drawn curtains with the lawyer's wife on the road to Hidegkut. This pleasure drive was repeated every week from July to October. I had a sad childhood. Naked shepherds and goddesses on lids of snuff boxes were my childhood companions. Swans, violinists in breeches and white wigs, enamelled mail coaches. Later, my father brought along an old gentleman who read La Fontaine's fables to me. He used to wear a long white waistcoat. I don't remember his name but whenever he looked up from his book, a pair of unforgettable, wonderful eyes fell on me. When I was first unhappy, my instinct led me back here, to the old house. It was autumn. Our old Frenchman was still alive and he watched me unnoticed for a long time. Ever since, whenever I'm troubled, I always come here. Just in case the old man is still alive. You were desperately in love with Fanny. How I pitied you. She was a dear, faithful lover, with dreams in her eyes and enchantment in her voice. "My sweetheart", she would say as she caressed me with her soft palm. Oh, my God! She was 30, had two false teeth, but her hair, that was real. Oh, my God! And this one? Why do you want to turn my life upside down? Why? You make me miserable. We spent a sleepy afternoon in the Serbian church of Buda and then wandered among the graves in the old cemetery, where she defended her virtue, her honour, her peace of mind, leaning against the rusty railings of a grave, as I stood before her with bowed head and thought of the goldsmith's wife. No, I'm not like the others. I shall die if you leave me. I swear, I shall die. I didn't notice your hair turning a little grey. Your voice sounds like a cello. I like it very much. My moral decay didn't start here. Here we are. God be with you, Szindbéd. God be with you, Florentina. I hope I'll see you tomorrow. If fate allows, you shall see me. Goodbye. I won't come tomorrow. It would be a pity to carry on this affair. I've never got involved with women who wanted me. That's why I've stayed young. I'm completely disillusioned with you. No reproaches, please, sweetheart. You've put on your dark glasses again. Life is a chain of beautiful lies. There is no feeling more touching than love. At our age, when all noble feelings, like piety, devotion, respect, friendship, patriotism are slowly fading from this world, only love is capable of conjuring back the illusion of times long past. We need the tenderness of women more than ever. Because every woman, even the most common is related to the moon, to the other world, to superstition. Only women can improve us men who've become brutes. And they should be given the chance to carry out this improvement on men. Don't talk about that, Mr Szindbéd. We both know each other. You are an ugly, grey-haired, debauched man. I can no longer trust you with my honour. I have no memories yet. I've been a good woman, the best mother and the most faithful wife, as they say on death notices. I feel as if some illusion is missing from my soul. I'd like to be familiar with a name. It always starts like this. I'm not starting anything. It always starts like this. I'm only sorry that no one will ever whisper sweet lies to me again. Please sir, lie to me. I could invent a romantic adventure about a hysterical princess or an innocent virgin who fell in love with me at first sight. But I'll tell you one thing: women were very good to me because they never loved me. Never. No one? No one was ever interested in what lies beneath this coat. And yet you seem to be an interesting person. Tell me, why didn't women love you? Because I never lied to them. I clenched my teeth and I never told a woman that I loved her. Last night I dreamt about keys. In the book of dreams Monday means pleasure. I wonder whether they still drink strawberry brandy in the Blue Barrel? Forget-me-nots. Well, what do you want to say? I'd like to die. And I will die very soon. You'll make a beautiful bride in the world beyond. Bravo Téssza, bravo! Would you mind taking me home, sir? God bless you. Thank you for bringing me home. My fair child, you won't regret it if you will love me. Please, wait here in the front of the house. I shall throw down a flower from my window, as soon as I've reached my room. You seem like a decent fellow. Are you down there, sir? You should spare those two old horses. Who on Earth are you looking for in Cat Street? You, madam. You're probably after some girl around here. I don't like you being unfaithful right in front of my eyes, Szindbéd. I'm looking for you, Majmunka, as I haven't seen you for ages. Maybe you still remember me. Yes, I don't usually forget that easily. Though I haven't had the honour of your presence for three years. You know Szindbéd... ...I don't love you as an abandoned, forgotten sweetheart should but more as a mother. And I know you, as if I had given birth to you. Do you remember, ten years ago when you were ill and couldn't sleep unless I caressed your back. You promised me then you'd take me to the circus. But you never took me. And I'm not going anywhere with anybody but you. No reproaches. Majmunka. When you were a girl you saw enough of the circus. It's hardly any different from the musical hall. Yes, but the horses! The horses, the horses! We have seen enough farce in our lives. I'll tell you something else. When spring comes and women's handkerchiefs are full of the germs of love, we'll go up into the hills together. We'll cross the Danube by horse tram. The bridge will rumble beneath us. The coachman will blow his horn and a couple from the country will sit opposite us. She'll keep on asking, "Is it far to the Imperial Baths?" In an inn in Hay Square a concertina will play. But we won't get off, we'll carry on. The coachman will blow his horn again. The country couple will already be asking for information about the Imperial Baths. Fragrant air will blow from the Buda Hills into the coach and we'll sit side by side... ...like a very happily married couple. I'm a retired accountant and you've been my wife for 20 years. We have 1000 forints in the bank and we're on the lookout for a little cottage in the suburbs where we can have a little garden and you can raise ducks and geese. You, you, you! Isn't this better than going to the circus? Of course, it is better, you scoundrel! Good day! I didn't recognise you, sir! It's been a long time. I used to have a good friend here, by the name of Valentin. - Do you know him? - Of course. You want to do a deal with Valentin! You've improved in your old age. Interested in business now! Last time you came you weren't doing anything but wasting your time! Please, ladies... We'll send the lad to fetch Valentin, if you wish. I'd like to see you on New Year's Eve because, you see, Fm superstitious. My darling, my beloved, my betrothed... Oh God, give me quiet sleep, a peaceful night. Let me never hear again what the women are chattering. Help me to forget the scent of their hair, the strange look in their eyes, the taste of their hands. Please God, protect me from them! Please, marry me. It is the fate of the stars to fall from Heaven for each other. Who'll listen to the story of the wanderer devoured by the wolves? Do you remember when you took my sins upon you at confession because you had no sins to confess? Yes, but I didn't do it for nothing, you had to pay a Kreutzer a sin. And now I'm asking you again to take my sins upon you as I have no moral strength, Valentin. All right. Let's hear what I'm taking on. I have cheated, stolen, lied, sworn. I have never kept the fast, never been to church. I've committed everything except murder. And what about fornication? That too. I wanted to seduce the sweetheart of a childhood friend. Maybe I did seduce her. And with the stolen money I bought her an apron. And what are you willing to pay if I take on all this, on Good Friday? What can I give to you who saved my life so many times? Can you exorcise the Devil? Of course. You'll pay me by exorcising the Devil from my wife, Marika. Mama'? Yes. I married Marika. For 20 years now we have been living peacefully but a few months ago a new lad came to my workshop. Since then Marika has been quite unmanageable. You know Marika, try to exorcise the Devil from her. I won't allow you to corrupt this good man! This is Marika. In May I shall be a sumac tree or a roadweed. Life was worth living when one could appear mysteriously at night in a garden, knocking at a window, whispering sweet words to a hesitant woman, when it was possible to flame and wilt and laugh happily. Someone is nearing the house, someone's thoughts are here. - Fruzsina! - Where have you come from'? Why can't you rest in the other world? I wanted to see you once more. I don't even dare to dream. My life is full of sorrow. Even my dreams are being spied on. Szindbéd, I must marry. We become mistletoe. But even so, I managed to find the gate and there I was sitting in the room of the goldsmith's wife. I might just as we“ have been a comb. Fanny. Fm very sad. Everybody has abandoned me. I'm alone. My lovers have died, grown old. Do you remember when we met here? I thought !'d die out of sheer excitement. I came crying because Pd never had a rendezvous before. It was good, beautiful and I was the happiest woman in Buda. Thank you for corrupting me. At least I've lived. I can't live. Don't bother me with that nonsense, Szindbéd. I wonder whether Amelia is still alive. - Madam... - Yes? Could you show me that locket you are wearing around your neck? It was passed down to me from my mother. My poor dead mother. Yes, that's why I'm asking you, because Mrs Marchali was a very good friend of mine at one time. My father's picture when he was a soldier. Please. And you, are you married yet? Yes, and I have two beautiful children. - Paula! - Good heavens! Weren't you expecting me? Didn't you dream about me? Once last week or yesterday. But I dream a lot of foolish things. How come you are here? I was curious to know how you've been since we last met. Do you remember, when we went down the Danube on a boat, the stars glittered and the Serbian captain fell in love with you? - You mean Gyoko? - I hope, not in vain. Please. I never saw him again. After all at that time I loved you. I loved you very much. A happy man. How easily you say it. Why, isn't it enough that I'm here? I've come to see you because I wanted to kiss your hand. Please turn around. You haven't changed a bit. There's no one to take care of me, though I'm sickly. Can your little heart be empty? Silly boy. Is it so easy to forget you? Serpent, serpent, liar serpent. How many times have you forgotten me since then? I have an excellent plan for this afternoon. Well, well! And now walk home with me. I live nearby. Hell's bells... Come on, let's get started! Hungary is downtrodden, the sad Hungarians cry. These villagers don't know what a good wine is. Is it true, Szindbéd, that you're pretty much a debauched man? I look everywhere for sober men and all I find are drunks. They say that you have no profession. Tell us, what do you live on? I bestowed on him the rank of captain. I regret that knights errant are no more. I like to roam aimlessly about the world, occasionally I write a bit. The actors say you live on air. The actors measure everything in this world against their fees. So you're not an adventurer? Pity. Well, well! That's the way it goes: don't grasp too much or nothing will be left to you. Take what you deserve! Come my good steel, take my blood, I hate you, life! If I cannot command, I don't want life, I cast it away. Hell's bells. Szindbéd, help me! We won't wait until it gets dark. There's no softer quilt than snow! Life, sacred, tiresome life! How good it is to come back to you! What is your name, my friend? Vendelin. At your service. - Do you have a wife? - I had one, sir. - Did she die perhaps? - Something else happened. I don't particularly like carrots... May I bring the marrowbone, sir? You may. Only I must ask you, my friend Vendelin, to bring slices of bread toasted and not rolls. They're no good with this. And this should be hot, like my girl's heart! And now, you can bring me the beer in a tankard and with no froth. The bartender can keep that for himself. As you wish, sir. Your innkeeper must be a rich man. Why, sir? Because he gives a lot of froth. Well then, my friend Vendelin, what in fact happened to your wife? She left me, sir. Left? You see, as a young waiter I worked at the casino. At that time, gentlemen like Mr Pechy, Mr Szemere, Mr Uchtritz were my clients. Uchtritz. The jockeys used to wait outside in the dining room. The trainers used to sit in the corridor. Uchtritz. That's where the tipping went on, sometimes till after midnight. We waiters were on the best of terms with the jockeys. I could hardly ever go to the races, nevertheless I knew every horse. And of course I never won. What sort of roast meat could I have? I see you've got roast duck. But I eat enough of that at home. Yes, roast duck with red cabbage. You know Vendelin, I prefer venison for lunch. In the old Lippert inn they used to have the best roast game. Old Lippert himself was a great hunter, he used to be the chief rifleman of the Buda Shooting Club and I knew that and went to his place to eat rabbit. Here, I see you have pheasant stuffed with sweet chestnuts. My only question is: are they Italian or Hungarian chestnuts? Pheasant stuffed with chestnuts. Well, if there is nothing wrong with that bird, I'll have it. I wonder why it is that women scrape carrots with such fury? Here is the pheasant, sir. I've brought some mashed potato and gherkins to go with it. That's not everything, Vendelin. Where are the different mustards? I, for instance, am very partial to hot, homemade mustard. I'm not against French mustard, but English mustard is my favourite! Once Chevalier Wiener-Waldau said to me, "Vendelin, I want to make you lucky." Stake your money on Duke Festetich's horse, Patience. Every time she runs... Patience... a familiar name. And if you'd only known her, sir. I nearly forgot. I'd like to eat some tender boiled beef! Here it is! Tell me Vendelin, have you got in your kitchen a piece of beef, on the bone or off the bone? I don't mind having rib, though I prefer back. But do you know what I'd like best of all? If there happened to be the piece of meat called "Tafelspitz". You see, that's what I'd like. With tomato sauce, spring onions. An innkeeper with any self-respect always has spring onions. After the pheasant? I don't care how you normally bring the courses. Who do you think I am that you can prescribe to me what I should eat? - I beg your pardon, sir. - Well, then. It wasn't just the horse that was called Patience, but also the course inspector's daughter. Am I disturbing you? Go on. As I was in particular favour with the Chevalier Wiener-Waldau, he once asked me if I was inclined to marry Patience. I married her. And that was my undoing. I loved her very much. She ran off and got a job in Debrecen as a cashier. Now I'm ready for half a litre of wine! So Patience became a cashier in Debrecen? Yes, sir. She started divorce proceedings after a foolish country gent asked for her hand. That foolish country gent was me. Yes... I was Patience's second husband. Did she leave you, too? Did she run off with someone? - Where is she now? - We have to let it go. I'll go any way you want me to. We'll go tomorrow night. Near the river Sajé where I was born, I always saw babies in the water and now I have no baby, just you. She was only 20. Death has no fight, no shade. But it has a slight scent of rosemary. At last, we'll get rid of a shabby pair of trousers of a nickel-plated watch chain. We'll get rid of niceties, of lies and of all the paraphernalia of life on Earth. You are the only one, Majmunka. How lucky I am that women are so fickle. Like the morning dew. Every now and then you will visit me as well. Florentine is dead. Her blood fled with her dreams. This book by Paul de Kock - do you remember, you bought it for me? Nowadays, I only sin through reading. So I've settled my account with life. I have no more desires or hopes. Like an old bird, I roost on top of a tree. But I'm glad that there are still some who believe in life... ...in love. I love you. Let's get to bed. The reason you came was to get me to talk to the goldsmith's pretty wife who you are longing for. Isn't that so? Well, yes. I've gone mad. The Devil has taken away my senses. I loathe myself so much that I want to bash my head against the wall. I went to see my mother. She is well. She lives as she did countless years before. She still has her land and her vineyard. She doesn't depend on anyone. She's different from me. They were of a different breed as to how we grew up to be. They knew how to live. In those days, you could still live. And they knew how to live well. But these people don't know it. They don't even know about the beauty of life. They don't know what a good meal is, what a delight good rest can be. I don't like these modern times. They say these are transitory times. But I didn't ask for any transitory time nor do I remember even wanting this life either. I have never asked for favouritism. I'm not even interested in knowing what there is to be happy about being Hungarian. What is your favourite tune, Doctor? Daddy, give me some more tea. Play "The Swallow", Zsiga. I wonder if a regular customer like me ever dies. We ought to move into the shade of the tower. Come now, what sort of trouble could real love bring? The trouble is that Angel may easily leave us when she hears people gossiping about your living in sin. You really should return to the world, however little you understand its ways. The trouble is that I know no more about life than a child. I don't know the secret of how to behave, what to say and how to succeed. I ought to sit in a garden or hospital, doing nothing but planning... Just planning. Only planning. Because as soon as it comes to action, I make a mess of everything. I ruin it all. I have sinned so much that I daren't stay alone in my room at night. How about those celebrated doctors in Budapest? Can't they do something about a little nightmare? I'm not afraid of you. I know you won't give me bad advice. At night, when we reach the holy place, stay by the church wall and sleep among the old womenfolk. Strange images dance before my eyes. As fair as the waters of the Poprad. All noblemen are mad. My father kept the post-mistress' old shoes in a drawer. And you, you've heard a name you can't forget. Her name is Duskie. So that' s what keeps you awake at (fight. The pilgrimage will come to nothing. You must sleep under an open sky if you don't want the devils to find you. Devils? Do devils exist at all? Of course, they do. But they dare not follow us here. Come on, let's go. The days of my senses are drawing to a close. Mrs Busi! Here is the gentleman who can't sleep. Put him to sleep. Women, wake up! My heart. Heal me, Mother. I beg you! Your father died of heart failure, too. My heart. Bad meals, wine and false kisses poison your blood. When shall I die? Your time has not come yet. Dreams, dreams, sweet dreams. Now I will close my eyes. Blessed be your coming. Dream of life, life of my dreams. Winter Fairy! Oh God, to be here again! Thank you, Szindbéd. I'll always be grateful to you. Winter Fairy, goodbye. Farewell, Szindbéd!
