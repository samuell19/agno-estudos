Spring Rain (a film novella) [Peace] to the world! Ticket inspector! - Your ticket, please. - Ticket? Sure, give me a sec. Now... just a moment... Come here, please. Are you... crying? Did something happen? Did you lose anything or... ...was it stolen? So what happened? Oh, you're crying because of all this! - That's nothing. - To you, it's nothing, sure! But I'm late for work! - Nothing funny! I did have a ticket! - But you lost it, right? Me too. Just like that. How did you?.. Sleight of hand. So what do you do? If it's not a secret, of course. - Making money. - And how do you manage that? In one of 232 ways. - Come on, I'm serious. - I'm serious. I work at the factory. I'm an engineer. And what do you do? - I'm at the factory too. I'm a turner. - And a student. I'm a student as much as you're an engineer. - Why do you say that? - Because it's obvious. So you think I couldn't become an engineer? You probably could, but you didn't, did you? - Why is that? - Well, I wouldn't know. Maybe you weren't smart enough, maybe it was something else. Could be anything. You must be regretting that you set me free. You can always lock me back in. Why, I'm a kind man. Me, I am mean. What's your name by the way? - I'm Katya! - I'm Kostya! - Hello, Katya. - Hello, Kostya. - What are you doing here? - Drinking water. - No, I mean generally. - I work here. - No way! - Why? Because I work here too! Got any plans? - Going home. - Alone? - Well, waiting for companions too. - Must be some specific companions. - No, nobody specific. - May I walk you home then? - My home's the other way. - Mine's the other way too. You probably have to book the bench in the morning. There's my house, Kostya. Will you come tomorrow? Right at the entrance then? - That exact place. - That exact time. I should go. Go on, leave. Go! - Tell me a story. - I don't know anything. Think it up then. You're supposed to entertain me. Think it up? I'm thinking all the time, but nothing came of it yet. Just dreams, soap bubbles. I keep dreaming of doing something big, extraordinary... But it never works out. When I was a kid, do you know what I dreamt of? Running away overseas and starting a rebellion, right? - Exactly! How did you know? - Because I dreamt of it myself. I didn't just dream! I ran away from home, even reached Tashkent, there the police caught me and sent me back home under escort. Yeah... I know it was nonsense, all this rebellion stuff. Only they're telling me now: "Do common, regular work. It's more valuable and it's harder." But I can't! I agree, but I can't! I'd rather get a damn grenade and throw myself under a tank! Do you understand? I understand. Do you really? You're the only one in the world. - I'm what? - You're nice. - I'm just like the others. - Oh no. It's late, Kostya. An early day tomorrow. I'll see you home. Excuse me. Mom's still not in bed. Does she get angry when you're late? She won't be angry tonight! On the contrary, I need to get up early tomorrow. She's got used to me. Mom's not home, she'll be back at six! Excuse me, does Katya live here? - No, she's across the floor. - Thanks. I'm sorry, some relatives from Voronezh came to visit, and Mom told me to show them around the stores. Hoo, I'm so tired! I was afraid you'd get bored waiting... - ...and leave. - Where would I leave without you? I like your dress, it's pretty. Don't wear it though. - Why? - I don't want it. - Everyone will be looking at you. - Let them look. - No, can't have that... - Shh, neighbors! It's fine, nobody's home. What's that in your pocket? Vodka? - Is it a holiday? - No, I'll tell you on the way. - Where are we going? - I'll tell you on the way. And they sort of invited us... well, to the party. - How do they know me? - You're with me, naturally. - So who are these guys? - You don't know them probably. Mishka Sverdlov, Slavka Nefyodov, Syoma Bulanchik... Syoma Bulanchik, sure, I know him... You're just new to the factory. Everybody knows Syoma. But of course, I won't go, Kostya. I know these kind of parties, I know why they invite girls... What, are you afraid? You're with me! I'm not afraid, even if I go there alone. I just don't want to look at their drunken mugs. Anyway, I'm not going and I don't want you to go. Now I feel awkward, I promised them I'll come. Well, now you won't. They'll manage. If I said I'll go, then I'll go. No, you won't! I'm not your husband, so quit yelling! So these are your extraordinary doings... Get hammered with vodka and sleep in a puddle like a pig. And you wanted to start a revolution?.. You're all the same. - Go on then, I'm not stopping you. - And I will. - Go on then! - And I will. Kostya... Katya! Katya! Movie theater Excuse me, did you see anyone else here? - Have you been here long? - I didn't see anyone, I told you! - Hello. - Hello. Are you angry at me? I got it, okay? Forgive me, please, will you? What did I do anyway? Why quarrel over nothing? Huh, Katya? Katya? Katya! What, what do you want, Kostya? Don't be like that. You don't love me? I don't know. I don't know, dear. Come on, what did I do wrong? All of it because of one sorry bottle? Lots of people drink way more, and so what, they go on living somehow. They do... They do. You understood nothing, Kostya. The End
