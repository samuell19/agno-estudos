Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram See, I'll say Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram. Good morning uncle One, two, three, four First, first, Amal you begin the song. One, two, three, four Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Like his films the music of Satyajit Ray is a unique multi-layered... blending of western sense and Indian sensibility. His complete mastery of this art form is a culmination... of a long family tradition. I was born in a musical family, my grandfather UpendraKishore... was a composer, violinist. He played the flute, he played the pakhawaj. And on my mother's side, my mother's grandfather KaliNarayan Gupta,... was a wonderful composer and... it so happens that on my mother's side... practically everyone is a natural singer. My grandmother could sing and all her sisters could sing. My mother could sing and my mother's sisters, brothers... and cousin were all natural singers. So I grew up in an atmosphere of music and... singing Rabindra Sangeet... and Brahma Sangeet, right from my birth. I have been exposed to western classical music from a very early age. There were some records of classical music in my house. I don't know where they came from... but I had heard Beethoven's works... and some other western music from when I was a small boy. I had a gramophone, a toy gramophone and some small records given to me... as a birthday present which consisted of all,... all of it was western music waltzes, marches and all that. So western music has never been unfamiliar to me. I was exposed to it and I had heard it along with Bengali songs... and Bengali music. I was listening to western music, of some kind or... other and it developed into a very serious interest when... I was at school. Towards the end when I was thirteen, fourteen. I had a friend at school... who came from a fairly well to do family. And he also got interested in western music and... he started buying records. It was in his house that I was able to listen to music of... Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and others. So I got initiated very very early when I was at school. When other boys were writing poetry or reading poetry. I was listening to music... reading about it, going to libraries because... I couldn't afford to buy books. Reading about composers and compositions and musical forms. So it was a very early initiation. "Pather Panchali" Satyajit Ray Well this was at the time of chiliarchy, I had worked with Ravi Shankar. In "PATHER PANCHALI", Ray made a major breakthrough in, Indian film music,... not only by using the gifts of a classical composer like Ravi Shankar... but also by exploiting them... from an essentially cinematic point of view. His collaborations with several classical composers... in the next few films created, a new idiom of film music in India. On "Jalsaghar" I had worked with Vilayat Khan. (Story based on Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay's DEVI) And on "Devi" I had worked with Ali Akbar. But they had become very busy international composers; they were not always available when I needed them and... I did not want to dictate other composers. So at the time of "Teen Kanya" in 1960, I think,... I decided to try my own hand at composition. It was very difficult to start with but, eventually in course of time... I managed to acquire some professionalism. TITLE MUSIC Satyajit Ray Production Presents: Story based on Rabindranath Tagore's Postmaster, Manihar, Samapti "TEEN KANYA" (The Three Girls) It was in "Teen Kanya"... that Ray proved that, as film music is one of the... components of a film, a director of musical background,... is the fittest person to do the scoring for his film. From "Teen Kanya" onwards, Ray employed in each film a theme music to underline... its central mood and to suggest elite motive... in the multiplex structure of the film. Film Music and Direction Satyajit Ray "Samapti" Laksmi An increasing stress... on natural sounds and particularly silence and the... "Kanchen Jungha" 1962 sparing use of musical accompaniment are... 2 important features of Ray's music There is something I want to say. He is a great man as we belong to the new generation,... so the association, particularly between him and us. I should leave. - No wait, what I am saying is I have been looking for you, for quite a long time. - I know. Sir please give me some money, Sir please give me some money. Take it, this is yours. Good day, Sir. Jagdish... Banerjee... Banerjee, Manisha... Jagdish "Mahanagar" R. D. Bansal Presents Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar Staring: Anil Chattopadhyay; Madhavi Mukhopadhyay. Original story: Narendranath Mitra Such a big city! So many different kinds of jobs. Could none of us could find one? Let us try, I believe we both will find one. You know, today amidst all this grief, where we do not know what destiny holds for us... I still feel good. You are not afraid anymore. Are you? See. Let's go. - Let's go. Ideally, I think the director should be aware,... where music would be needed in his film. This is, I am talking of the ideal situation... where it is assumed that... the director knows about music, is conscious of music and also... knows where his films would call for music. But of course the ideal situation doesn't always exist... and you have directors who have very little conception of music. Where of course... he has to depend entirely on the professional composers. There you have to assume that... the professional composer is a competent composer. But in my case of course, since I have been aware of music,... from a very early age and music has been my first love... even before the cinema. And since I do my own composition I have very set ideas about... where music should be used in the film. The flowers nod as if intoxicated "Charu lata". The most satisfying experience to Ray as a music director. Even the structure of the film with... its subtle inner links is musical. A singing female parrot tantalises the surging wave even as... the cuckoo coos from its arbor. After the introduction of sound, in their very early days... there was no music in films. As you can see, if you see the films of early 1930s, there is very often... no music at all. But gradually the system of background music came into being and... professional composers emerged and big offices emerged. There was a period then in the 40s or later it is when music A film would be drowned in music. But even later after that... of course a kind of balance was struck and... music was used very discreetly. But also at the same time certain conventions developed. Like using a certain kind of music for happy situations,... a certain kind of music for sad situations,... another kind of music for situations of suspense and... these became formulas. Sometimes lazy composers would use these formulas rather than... think those situations afresh. We naturally tried to avoid these... hackneyed formulas as much as possible. I think all directors should avoid hackneyed formulas. Consider a situation afresh and try to be original... and avoid conventions avoid worn-out conventions. The call of cuckoo The pain of cuckoo My village What's the matter? See. In my case of course, I use music now less and less and less. "Sadgati" 1981. There are some directors in the west, as an example Bergman,... who hardly ever uses any music in his films. But we still do use music, partly because, out of consideration for the audience,... because sometimes the audience, we feel the less intelligent audience... would not be able to comprehend the moods, the changes in mood. Therefore we underline those changes those moods... by means of background music. But even so I would say I use music as discreetly as possible. Ray's musical genius finds its brilliant expression in the lyrics... and tunes he composed for his films. My first original lyric was written for "Devi". But the tune was not my own... it was based on the conventional Ramprasadi tune. The words were my own. I shall wander house to house asking for alms to survive. But I shall never come back to you calling you oh! Mother. Mother, I shall not call you mother henceforth as you have given me... and you are still giving me such torments. Mother, I shall not call you mother. But my first original song both lyric and tune and... orchestration was for "Chiriyakhana". This was the song "Bhalobasha tumi ki jaano"... which is supposed to occur in an old Bengali film. With legs placed one on the other. An open book of accounts and engrossed in your own thoughts. I keep saying that it's dawn but you don't seem to listen to me. What is it that you know of love? Then I got interested in writing songs... and found an opportunity to write songs. When I decided to make a film... of my grandfather's short story "Gupi Gaayin". Based on Upendrakishore Raichoudhary's story Gupi Gaayin Baagha Baayin Gupi's Character Tapan Chatterjee Baagha's Character Ravi Ghosh Other Characters Johar Rai, Santosh Dutta, Harindranath Chattopadhyay, Prasad Mukhopadhyay, Chinmoy Rai, Durgadas Banerjee, Shanti Chatterjee, Haridhan Mukhopadhyay, Ashok Mitra, Khogen Pathak, Nrupati Chaterjee, Govind Chakravaty, Kamu Mukherjee, Romenbhaduri, Ajay Banerjee, Avani Mukherjee, Rajkumar Lahir, Gopal Dey Dilip Basu(Guest), Rattan Banerjee, Binay Dutta, Tarun Mitra, Dr. Balai Das, Preeti Majumdar, Shailaig Ganguly, Mani Shreemani. It became an elaborate musical film, and for it I wrote about... seven or eight or nine songs. I started by writing some of the songs... even before I wrote the scenario, I imagined some of the situations... that would occur in the film and... I wanted to find out... whether I could be able to compose songs for the film. I wrote three or four as a try out... and when it turned out that... they were quite satisfactory I decided to make the film. Emperor, we salute you We come from the country of Bengal We come from the country of Bengal We are simple living men... who wander off to a different kingdom. We are simple living men... who wander off to a different kingdom. Our language is different and we do not know your language. Our language is different and we do not know your language. Oh Emperor... Mr. Emperor. But we know a different language and we feel satisfied to sing for you... as we come for that. King, Oh Emperor. We sing in that same language We sing in that same language Oh mighty King listen to our song to your hearts satisfaction. It is the language of rhythm, the language of rhyme, the language of tempo, the language of joy. The language spoken is such that it is understood by all. The language spoken is such that it is understood by all... rich or poor big or small all are the same. Rich or poor big or small all are the same... so I sing in this language, So I sing in this language, I sing the song. Oh! Emperor my salute to you. "Hirak Rajar Deshe" 1980 Sing... Where is the song? Sa Re Ga - Ga Ga Ga We are finished Sa Ga Ma Ga Where is the song? I beg of you I beg of you Tiger uncle Please do not be annoyed uncle. Who would have known that you would be in the room? You in this room. Who would have known that you would be in the room? It is like having lightning without having any clouds. Lightning without clouds The work being almost done Lightning without clouds The work being almost done For heaven's sake please be calm Uncle. Who would have known that you would be in the room If my neck, if ever my neck is attacked by your paws. Oh my oh my, if ever my neck is attacked by your paws. I know what shall happen to me. Two fresh lives will be lost forever Fresh to live. Will be lost I know two fresh lives will be lost. Who would have known that you would be in the room Brother Baagha, tell me how many diamonds have you taken Do we have time for that genius. Still I would like to know how many you have taken I have taken enough Then there is no need to take any more No need to take any more come now let's run away Come now let's run away We've achieved the goal with great difficulty That's more than enough That's more than enough His latest experiment in music in Ghare Baire. Like Tagore in his songs and... Ravi Shankar in his instrumental music, Ray has blended western and Indian elements to create... his own distinctive musical form and he has succeeded where... others have failed in Indian cinema. H M V Recording studio One, two, three, four The fifth key has a vibrar key note... there watch out Number 5 - 8... Ma dha pa On mid note the fifth note should fall. - Yes. How will that happen? What yes? Where are you placing it? Number 8 I will place it at eight. I'm looking at eight itself. - The one on eight There is no getting away from the fact, that no other film director in India... has demonstrated the same command of film music as Ray. Ray's music is imaginative, not melodramatic, balanced, not exuberant, functional, not decorative. It is music that grows from the film itself. It seems, that Indian cinema is not prepared yet, to adopt,... the language of Ray's music. Stop! It's okay. 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, continue playing for every piece. It has been my intention right from the beginning to work... as an independent composer. Not in opposition with other professional composers in music... but only for my own pleasure, I do it because I love doing it. I love composing songs, I love composing background music and... that is what I have been doing. There have been one or two exceptions... I have worked for one or two other composers. Other directors in other films... such as, well for instance Shakespeare Voila. But as a rule and... this is going to be a rule not only for now for future also... I shall work only for myself.
