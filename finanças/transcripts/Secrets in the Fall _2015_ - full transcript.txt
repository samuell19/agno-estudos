(piano music) (light music) - Okay, let's see here. Oh (laughs). Wait, is that? Yeah, okay. There we go. Much better (clears throat). This video diary, or vlog, as some of the more tech-savvy will call it, will be used over the course of the Fall Youth Retreat Weekend, to capture all those Kodak moments. Isn't that right, Mr Bear? (as bear) We're going all those Kodak moments (laughs). I'll be documenting all the highs, the lows, the drama, the old friends, the new friends and so on. At the end of the week, I volunteered to put together a special film for next Sunday's church service. As a high school senior I've spent the past three years attending this retreat, but this'll be my first time as a counselor. I'll admit I'm a little nervous, because the past counselors were so easy to look up to, and I just hope I can be as good of a role model as they were for me. Of course, I am used to being around kids, as I am the proud older brother of six adopted siblings. (children laugh) Count them. But, this weekend will hardly consist of kids. I'll be surrounded by confused freshmen and sophomores, those juniors who think they know better. Students that I myself once was in a time not so long ago. Which brings me to my fellow counselors. Some friends, some strangers, but I look forward to spending the weekend with each one of them. For starters, we have a familiar face. MaryJake Harper. Some might call it an identity crisis. Others, a crisis of the heart. MaryJake joined our church last year. She changed her social circle at school, and began to transform from that popular socialite she once was into someone completely different. And I use the term "different" because I don't think that she or anyone else really knows who she's becoming. Along with MaryJake comes her old friend Sydney, who has constantly rejected MJ's invitation to go to youth group, but for some strange reason agreed to go with her into the woods for the weekend. Things should stay interesting to say the least. Then we have Bobby Cothern, who is probably one of the shyest guys you'll ever meet, unless there's sports involved. Bobby is big and buff, and, okay, huge, and really intimidating for a guy like me. There are no secrets in a video diary. Grayson, a college freshman who decided to come back for this special occasion, is an exciting addition. He's that guy everyone wants to be friends with. The cool part is, he's friends with me. - Who you calling an old man? - [Grayson] I'm calling you an old man. - [Man] Where do you think you got your skills? - You know what, dad? I'm gonna go out on a limb here. I'm gonna say God. - And, last but not least, that brings me to ... Well, me. Brant Journigan. Certified Grizzly Bear Scout, blogger, vlogger and soon to be camp counselor. Amen. Anna, are you ready? (video hisses) (children laugh) - Tell me again why we can't come. - Please. We'll be good, we promise. - [Brant] Aw, guys. We'll be back Sunday. It's barely two days. You guys are gonna have a great time here with mom and dad. I hate missing family game night. - And what Brant really means is, we're gonna miss you too. And Friday night Yahtzee. - Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste, bug spray, deodorant. - Mom, we got it. - [Mom] Zit cream. Underwear? I know, I know. And I know you guys will be good. - We always are. But we've gotta go. We'll be back before you know it. - [Mom] Here you go. Check mirrors. Watch blind spots, wear your seat belts. - [Brant] Got it, we got it. - (laughs) Trust me mom, he drives slower than grandma. (mom laughs) Well, you do. - [Mom] All right, I love you guys. - Bye, guys. - [All] Bye. - You said Camille's gonna be there, right? - Yeah. Camille and MaryJake are both counselors. - Good. I'm so glad Camille's gonna be there. - Why the sudden fascination with Camille? - Oh, no reason. - Spill it. - I just want to talk to her, that's all. - Oh, and you can't talk to your big brother? - Girl talk, okay? Now, come on, you're embarrassing me. - Ooh, girl talk. Yeah, I'll pass. (playful music) (doorbell rings) - Hey! I told you this was a camping trip, right? - You did. Although I don't see what that has to do with anything. Are you going for the natural look or are you trying to look like you just woke up? Makeup much? - Um, it's just packed, that's all. - Well, you're lucky I'm here with a fresh supply of lip gloss and mascara. - (drily) What would I do without you? Anyways, you cannot bring all this. Pick and choose. And hurry up, because we have to catch the bus. (light music) - The bus? - All right, let's load up. Time to go, everybody. Go on, enjoy your camper status before you're too old to join the back of the bus truth or dare. Oh, Anna! If they dare you to eat the gum from underneath the seat, just say no. (Anna scoffs) Say no. - Hey, look who I found in the back alley. Come on Cameron, bus is loading up. - Tyler, I meant to talk to my dad. (downbeat note) I'm not feeling so great. - [Tyler] Not feeling great? What's wrong? - I just don't feel good. - Don't feel good or don't want to go on this retreat? Hey, it's me you're talking to. - I just don't want to go. - [Brant] Don't want to go? Cameron? Come on, give it a chance. You're gonna have a great time. - You don't know what you're talking about. - [Brant] Oh, I think I do. I've been on this retreat every year. You can say I look forward to it more than Christmas morning. - Come on, chin up, Cam. The best medicine for "No feel good" is the long bus ride, all right? Go grab a seat, bud. - Hey, what was that about? - [Tyler] I think he's just got some self-esteem problems. You know, high school can really do that to a kid. - [Grayson] Yeah. - But, how about you talk to him? I know he really looks up to you, Grayson. - [Grayson] Me? - Yeah. - What about Brant? I just don't know what I'd say. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm excited about being a camp counselor and everything. I'm just kinda new to all this stuff. - You'll get this stuff just fine. You'll figure it out. (bright music) - [MaryJake] Sorry we're late, guys. - [Tyler] Hey, look you decided to show up. - [MaryJake] I know, I know. (Tyler laughs) - It was my fault. I'll take all the blame. - You must be Sydney. - How'd you guess? - MaryJake told me she's bringing a friend named Sydney. So I put the two and two together. (Sydney laughs) - You're just so funny. - Okay, come on, let's get our stuff on the bus. Thank you, Bobby. - [Brant] MJ! - [MaryJake] Hey, Brant. (quietly) Can I talk to you for a second? What on earth was that? - What? Tyler's an attractive guy. - How do you even know who he is? - I saw him that one time you dragged me to youth group with you, and ... (gushes) You just can't forget that face. - Do not tell me that's the reason you agreed to come this weekend. Because of Tyler. - You know, ever since you started doing the whole church thing, you've started sounding a lot like my mom. It's beginning to become a bit annoying. - [MaryJake] Don't say that. I'm not acting like your mom. All I'm saying is, you'd better not ditch me this weekend because you're busy chasing Tyler. - Are you done? - [Bobby] All right, guys, you're all set. - [MaryJake] Thank you, Bobby. Bobby, this is my friend Sydney. Sydney, this is Bobby. - Hey. - [Sydney] Hey. What's his deal? - [MaryJake] He's shy. He doesn't talk much, but he's really nice, though. - You church people are so weird. - Come on. - [Woman] Guess who? - You made it! - [Woman] Tyler, I'm not too late am I? - It seems like late is the theme of the day. You're just in time. - I have always been a trend setter. - Listen, I think we've got a great group of counselors this year. Let's load up. - [Woman] All right. (light music) - Okay, everybody listen up. We've got a great weekend ahead. Fishing, hiking, kickball, camping, capture the flag, and did I mention freeze tag? But hey, there are a few rules. No boys in girls' cabins, and vice versa. No foul language, and absolutely no cell phones. (people groan) Hey Camille, could you collect those for me? - [Camille] Mm-hmm. - Come on guys, drop them in. Last I heard, God does not have unlimited texting. All right, come on, we've wasted too much time already. Let's go. (people cheer) (bright music) - So we find ourselves on the bus on the way to the mountains. There's some familiar faces, along with some new ones. Let's see here. Ah, we have Camille, the love of Grayson's life. Once an angry punk rocker, the confused starlet found herself again and became Tyler's co-worship leader. She graduated high school with Grayson, and decided college could wait a year while she's beginning a career in music. Ah, my sister Anna's along for the first time this year. She's always been a very smart kid, but you know how high school peer pressure can be. She's young and naive and innocent, and as her protective older brother I sure hope she stays that way. Ah, Cameron Atkins, ninth grade. They say he has low self-esteem, but I know how self-esteem issues can be brought on by outside forces. I just hope Grayson can talk to him and remind him that outside appearance isn't everything. Although I'm not sure how much that'll mean to him coming from a guy like Grayson. Yikes. It'll be interesting to see what unfolds this weekend. Wonder what this weekend has in store for me. Brand Journigan. (bright music) (people on bus cheer) - All right, everybody grab your bags, let's go! - [MaryJake] Come on, Sydney. - We made it. (people whoop) Now campers, I'm gonna connect you with your counselors, all right? So listen for your names. With counselor Brant Journigan. - [Brant] Hello. - [Tyler] We've got Mason Akers, Jeremy Johnson, and Wallace Burns. Counselor MaryJake Harper, Sydney Graham, Lizzie Bay, Ashlee Morris and Aubrey Isaacs. - [Both] Yes! - Grayson Thompson, you got Jessie and Ryan Bason, Drew Williams and Cameron Atkins. Counselor Bobby Cothern. - [Bobby] Yo. - [Tyler] Troy Gingers and Mikey Hannigan. And last but not least, Camille Saunders. Carrie Smith and Madelynn Bailey, Katie Teeson and Anna Journigan, all right? - Hey. - [Tyler] Hey, Sloane. So good to see you again. - [Sloane] You too. - Looks like you have some competition. - Please. Why would a guy like Tyler be interested in a girl like her? - Everybody, this is Sloane Berkley, head of the facilities here, and also resident nurse. - Hi. - Maybe because she's smart? - And this is her younger brother, Jason. He's the head of maintenance and pretty much head of everything else. (crowd murmurs greetings) - How's it going, you guys? - Welcome, everyone. Our parents built this camp when we were just little kids, and we know every nook and cranny of the grounds here. So if you need any help or you have any questions just come find us, we'll be around. - And nice. - [Tyler] Thank you, Sloane. Thank you, guys. I'm gonna head to the bus and start unloading. I'll be right back. And campers, grab your counselors and head to your cabins, all right? Boys on the right, girls on the left. My cabin's in the middle if you need anything. Meet at the camp fire at 5:30. Go! (laughs) (quiet music) - [Grayson] Hey Camille, wait up. You've got to wish me luck on this one. - You'll need a lot more than luck. I'll pray for you. - All right, I'll see you soon. - Hey Cameron, better let me have the top bunk. I don't wanna risk being crushed in the middle of the night. - [Grayson] Cameron. Go ahead in. Cameron, slow down. - (sighs) I just wanna be alone. - [Grayson] I know. I understand. Let's just talk for a second. - [Cameron] There isn't much to say. Except I wish I'd never come here. - You just got here. You haven't even given this weekend a chance. - I knew you wouldn't get it. - [Grayson] Cameron. - Well, you don't. You're cool and popular. Kids don't pick on you. You don't know how it feels. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Someone's picking on you? - Look at me. Why wouldn't they? - Cam, you are being way too hard on yourself. Look, we'll figure this out, but for this weekend, you don't have to worry about that. Nobody here is gonna be picking on you. (Cameron sighs) It's someone here? (sighs) Is is Drew? Oh, Cam. I could say something to him, or I can have Tyler talk to him. That's not right. - [Cameron] No, no. You can't say anything. It'll only make it worse. - [Grayson] Okay. Look, I'm not gonna say anything. Just don't let it get to you. Just 'cause you don't look or act like Drew doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you. And he's gonna figure that out. But until then, I'm here for you. Right? (slow music) - Thanks, Grayson. - [Grayson] All right, come on man, let's go. (hopeful music) ♪ The Lord has sworn not to rebuke me ♪ The mountains be moved, his love won't be ♪ For he has given grace abundantly ♪ He hasn't dealt with me after my sin ♪ But showed me love over and over again ♪ He has given grace abundantly ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to earn it ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to earn it ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to earn it ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to earn it ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to earn it ♪ I don't deserve it ♪ I don't have to ♪ Earn it - Now I want this to be a very special weekend for everyone. Usually at these retreats we have a certain theme. But this time I felt like we didn't need that. Instead, I want everyone to come up with their own theme. Think of that area of your life where you feel like you need God's guidance, and if you feel like you've got it all together, well, then use this weekend to pray for those who don't. Maybe your theme is loving your neighbor, or your enemy. Tomorrow night we're gonna meet back at the campfire, and I want everyone to share their theme and how it was impacted this weekend. All right, well, let's do another one. Camille? (laughing) - [Camille] I know, I thought that was so funny. - [Woman] And Mrs Burgess was looking everywhere and she couldn't find them. - It would have been so cool to be there. - I know, right? I don't know. It would have been a little scary. - Of course you would have been scared. You used to be scared to sleep over at my house. - That's because you told me that your little brother lets his pet tarantula out at night. - He does! - Well, hello, how are things going down there? - Going fine. Can I come up? - Sure. Come join me. Just watch your head. What's on your mind? - Oh, nothing. Just saying hi. I figured any friend of Brant's is a friend of mine. - Are you sure about that? (sniggers) Gotcha. So, are you having fun? - [Anna] Yeah. - Um, is there something you want to talk to me about? - No, nothing to talk about (laughs nervously). Are you having fun so far? - Yeah, the campfire was a blast. Although I'm not sure I'll ever get the smell out of my hair. - Oh, me too. But it's totally worth it. - Agreed. - Well, I'd better get back down there. We don't want the mani-pedis getting out of control. - Good night. - [Anna] Good night. (laughing) - [Both] He's so funny. (whispering and laughing) - I didn't realize we'd be competing in the Miss Camp Pinnacle pageant this weekend. - Laugh all you want. At least I won't look like Sloane. Has that girl ever heard of a flat iron? Speaking of, what is her name? - Ashlee. - Ashlee? Poor, poor, Ashlee. Her little piggy tails are so pathetic they make me want to cry (laughs). - Apparently someone forgot to tell her she's 15 and not five. - That look would be out for a five year old. Poor girl. High school's gonna eat her alive. Oh, she's looking (laughs). (slow music) - We'd better get to bed. Night. - [Sydney] Night. (indistinct murmuring) - [Woman] (quietly) I'm so jealous. (tense music) (threatening roar) - What was that? - [Man] I don't know. Should we go check? - Yeah. - Let's wake up Brant. - Brant, wake up. - [Brant] (sleepily) I'm not, no. - Brant. - [Brant] What the? Whoa, guys, what's going on? (roaring) I am so not cut out for this. Okay, okay, don't freak out. I'll go check it out. (menacing music) Hello? (door creaks) Hello? Guy's, there's no one out there. (all scream) - [Man] (laughs) That was priceless. - (relieved) Anthony, you ... Oh, you. - Let me finish that. "You scared me?" Just a joke, Brant. - Ah, a joke, you're so funny! What are you doing here? - Oh, counselor in training. Yeah, I had to help my mom so I missed the bus, but I'm here now. Now, which one of you campers is going to share their bunk with me? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Man, you guys need to learn about a little thing called humor. I'm crashing in Tyler's cabin. I just wanted to come say hey. Catch you in the AM. Whoo. Hah! (Anthony laughs dramatically) - [Brant] All right, back to bed, back to bed. Anthony Goodwin, the slightly frightening military son who lost his father to the war on terrorism. I don't really get him. About as much as I don't get his jokes. But I like him. (light music) ♪ I went to the levy ♪ In a Chevy and discovered it dry ♪ Could have passed on the task ♪ At the warning signs ♪ But I had to try ♪ Oh, I had to try ♪ Had I run, I nearly turned when I saw that it was you ♪ Having everything you wanted, being front ♪ And the speed takes you ♪ But I wanna help you ♪ No, I wanna help you - Coming to breakfast, Cam? All right, you better hurry up. I can't promise I'm gonna save you anything. - So, how do I look? - New shoes? - [Sydney] So you noticed. Yes, I bought them just for this special occasion. But it better not rain. The suede has not been treated yet. - All right, well, come on. I can't be late for this counselors meeting. - Of course you can't, because MJ follows all the rules. - You're just jealous because Tyler's gonna be there and you can't come. - Fair enough. Now, I know I can't expect much from a mess hall breakfast, and I'm really not trying to be difficult, but do you think they'll have a fruit and Greek yoghurt option? (MaryJake scoffs) (bright music) - [Brant] Good morning, guys. How did everyone sleep last night? Do I even want to know what's under there? - [Man] Uh, no. (laughing) - [Brant] Oh, Mikey. You got something on your face there man. Yeah, right there. - [Grayson] Hey Brant, look who decided to show up. - [Brant] Yeah, and make his grand entrance. - It's tough being this popular. You guys have to understand. - [Camille] I know, right? - [Anthony] Camille, are you still hanging around this guy? I just don't know what you see in him. - I've gotta look really deep down, but he does have some good layers. - Or the fact that I'm insanely charming. - Oh all right, all right, let's get some breakfast. ♪ And just like a movie - [Grayson] See you in a bit. ♪ You're moving right through me inside ♪ Why did we say goodbye? (Sloane laughs) ♪ Why did we say goodbye? - [Tyler] Can I help you with anything? - [Sloane] Only unless you're hungry. - [Tyler] I just ate. But give me a little time. I might get my appetite back. - Hey Lizzie, want to trade? - [Lizzie] Eww (laughs). - [Woman with pink hairband] That's so gross. - All right, it's all yours. - Yummy. (laughter) - [Camille] Hey. - Oh, hey. I didn't even notice that was you. - [Man in shirt] Tons of bears in these woods. - So you really think a bear came out of the woods, into your cabin and took your toothbrush? - Stranger things have happened. - Yeah, stranger things have happened. Like your breath. - Hey, Drew. - [Drew] What's up? Did Jessie tell you about the bear? - Yeah. - See, the truth is, this is just the first time his mom didn't pack his suitcase for him. (laughter) - You're such a jokester. - Thank you, thank you very much. Hey Cameron, just wanted to say thanks. - (slowly) For what? - Saving some for the rest of us. It's really very considerate. - Don't worry about him, Cam. He was saying something about a bear earlier. He's probably just mad. - [Tyler] Attention please. Well, good morning. - [All] Good morning. - Good morning! - I hope you had a good night and are ready for an even better day. Before you leave, please clean up your plates and help out Sloane so she doesn't have extra work to do. And now campers, meet at your cabins at 10:30 today to go over the schedule, all right? Don't be late, or I'll come find you. Counselors, meeting in 10 minutes to go over the itinerary for the day. Again, don't be late, or you know what I'll do. On a more serious note, I just want to say how happy I am to be with you guys this weekend. I'm also excited, ecstatic, extremely pleased, existentially happy, (laughter) um, let's get to the point. I'm really blessed to be here with you guys, all right? - [All] Aww. - [Tyler] (laughs) No, no, come on, come on. All right, I love you guys, okay? Counselors, nine minutes. - Hey, you must be Anthony. - Who told you that? - Bobby said we had this cool new counselor, named Anthony. - Wait, you think I'm cool? Sounds like you've got it all figured out. And that must make you ... Troy. - Yeah, how'd you know? - That's my job. - [Tyler] Counselors, eight minutes. - Gotta go, Troy. See you at 10:30. That was my counselor side talking. How'd I do? - Convincing. - I'll take that. - [Tyler] I'm glad to see everyone made it through their first night. Any problems? - Besides the minor cardiac arrest I had at 1:00 AM? (laughter) Things went smoothly. - Speaking of trouble, I think we all know Anthony. He's training with Bobby this weekend. - And fearless leaders we shall be. - Hey, Sloane put together some small first aid kids. You guys can pass these down. Also, here's the itinerary for the day. Look it over. - Here, I'll let you handle this. - Kickball, all right! Ooh, sorry ladies, looks like you're stuck with arts and crafts. - It's only so we don't show you boys up. I hate to tell you this, but Grayson's sport-tastic skills begin and end with basketball. (laughter) - Wow. I love how you believe in me so much. - Don't worry, there's always room for you in friendship bracelet class, moosie. - Aww, moosie? - [Grayson] Stop. - [Sydney] Morning all. Morning, Tyler. - Good morning. - [MaryJake] Sydney, I told you this meeting was for counselors only. - I know, I know, I know. I'm locked out of my cabin. Silly me. - Here, take my key. I'll meet you back there in a few minutes. - Lifesaver. See you soon. - The way she's moving in those kicks, you might just beat her there. - Yeah, no kidding. - [Grayson] Moosie? Really? Where'd you get that from? Her? (quiet laughter) - [Tyler] How's everything going so far? - [MaryJake] Um, fine. - [Tyler] Everything okay with your group? - [MaryJake] (unconvincing) Yeah. - What about Sydney? - Sydney? Why do you ask? - You look like something's on your mind. - This just isn't as easy as I thought it would be. - Being a counselor? - No. Bring a Christian. It's like everything I try to do right, Sydney reminds me of how I used to be. And we've been best friends since we were five, and I don't want to stop being her friend, but how am I supposed to change when she keeps telling me she likes the old me better? It's confusing. - Which you do you like better? (quiet music) - Sometimes I'm not sure. (bouncy rock music) - [Bobby] Go, Bears! Let's go! Oh, let's go, let's get that! (people cheer) ♪ In this world there is nothing ♪ Better than a good, good friend ♪ But try to replace it ♪ Just go on and waste your time ♪ You'll be back in the end (everyone cheers and shouts) ♪ And the trick is ♪ To be comfortable in your skin ♪ I guess what I am saying ♪ Is I think life's about ♪ La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ La, la, la, la, la-la-la ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪ The sweetest side ♪ Of the apple on this tree ♪ Will always taste bitter ♪ 'Til it's better ♪ Between you and me - [Woman] Go get 'em! (cheering) - I'll come over there and show you how it's done. - [Bobby] Cam, let's go Cam! Let's go! Bring 'em home! It's all you! It's all you! (cheering) - All right, bases are loaded. Next point wins. - [Grayson] You got this, Cam. Just focus. - All right Cam, here we go. - Run Cam, you got this. (tense music) (slow heartbeat) - [Bobby] Oh, yeah! - [Grayson] Let's go let's go. (disappointed sighs) (sighing) - Cam, Cam, Cam. Sorry, man. We'll get them next time, okay? - Fat chance. - [Tyler] (quietly) Cam. I'll go talk to him. - No, no, no, no. I got it. I got it. Thanks, Grayson. - [Grayson] Cameron. Cameron. (sad music) Cameron. Cameron, come on man. Cameron. Oh, man. Cameron! Cameron, I just want to talk to you! (calls out) Cameron! Tyler. - Keep going, guys. Where's Cameron? - That's the thing. He left. - [Tyler] What do you mean left? - Look, all I know is he left a note on the bed saying, "Gone camping. Be back Sunday." He didn't take his pillow. He didn't take his blanket. And he doesn't have a tent. I tried to find him, but there's just too much ground to cover. - [Tyler] That's all right. You did the right thing coming back here. I'll get a group together to look for him, okay? - [Grayson] Okay, good thinking. - Thanks. - [Grayson] Yeah. - [Tyler] (quietly) Hey Jason, can you help me find Sloane? - Yeah. - [Tyler] All right, thanks. All right girls, I need help from a few of you. Wow, I like your enthusiasm. Cameron Atkins has wandered off. I'm gonna make sure we can track him down. That's where you guys come in. You're going to need long pants and sweatshirts. The woods can get pretty chilly. - In the woods? Umm-- - [Tyler] MaryJake, thank you for volunteering. Do you and Sydney mind looking for him? - Sure, not at all. - We'll come too. - Yeah. - All right, now take one phone per group, just so we can reach each other. Some of the groups are gonna stay behind, because I think there's a pretty good chance Cameron might come back on his own. I want to make sure that he can come here. Camille, the rest of MaryJake's group is gonna join with yours. Let's plan to be back at the sunset service at 7:00 PM. MaryJake, Sloane can show you where to start looking. - [MaryJake] Okay, thanks. - [Tyler] Let's go. - [Sloane] Straight ahead is the Renegade Trail. It's one of three main trails that lead back to the lake. These woods are so thick, it's not likely Cameron's gone off the trail. Hopefully he's not too far ahead. - Um, are you coming with us? - No, I'm gonna stay behind and get dinner ready, but don't worry, you girls will be just fine. I've been on these trails thousands of times before. - Thanks, Sloane. - [Sloane] Yeah. (light music) - Be careful. I'm sure you'll know just what to say when you find him. - (sighs) I hope so. Oh, and hold down the fort while I'm gone. Don't let those girls push you around. - I made this for you. - (laughs) You shouldn't have, really. I'm never gonna live this one down. - Anything I can do to help you live up to your reputation. - Yeah. Wish me luck on this one. - [Camille] I know you don't want to hear this, but he reminds me of a young you. - A young me? Come on. - You'd better hurry if you want me to save you any s'mores. - S'mores? I'll be back. All right guys, let's go. (slow music) - [Sydney] You know, if Tyler had just said he wasn't coming, I would not be here right now. - [MaryJake] You don't say. - (snootily) "I've been on these trails a thousand times." It's like she's proud of the fact she's a wilderness woman. - Cameron! - [Lizzie] Cameron! - [Woman in light blue] You know, I'm not surprised he ran away. - [Lizzie] Me either. - Wait, what do you mean? - People pick on him at school. - Seems like he's always wandering off on his own. - What do they pick on him for? - Everything, really. It started with his weight, I think. - And then he put these sad videos online about how unhappy he is. I don't think he meant for anyone to see them. - But everyone did. I mean, everyone. - And that just made it worse. - Yeah, I feel bad for him. - [Lizzie] Me too. - Have you guys tried talking to him? - [Both] No. - Maybe that's what he needs, you know? Some friends that treat him right. - Yeah, but if we were his friends, then people might start to be mean to us too. I mean, what would people think? - Yeah. - I know what you mean, but you shouldn't let what other people think decide how you act. - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing you would understand. (slow music) - And just like that, our afternoon plans of freeze tag and canoeing were shattered. Not that I mind, really. Seems like every year my canoe tips, and that water is freezing. (people call for Cameron) Guys, after you yell you should wait a second together to see if we can hear him respond. If we're gonna be a search party, we're gonna have to do this right, all right? (light music) Lucky for you, I can educate you on the lay on the land. Of course, you boys know me as just another voice in the Sunday morning choir, but what I bet you didn't know is that I'm also a certified Grizzly Bear Scout. Hope you boys prepared yourselves. Grizzly Bear Scouts don't use trails. We could survive in the woods for weeks with the training that I've learned. - But, we will be back in time for dinner, right? - Well, Mason ... (dramatically) We might just have to let the trees decide. Onward! Cameron! Cameron! Cameron. Cameron! - Hey, I think I saw something over there. - A bit hairier than Cameron, don't you think? (Drew groans) - You all right, Drew? - Yeah. - You know, it would be a lot more helpful if you would take your headphones off. Drew, did you hear what I said? I said-- - I heard you, all right. - [Grayson] Wow, okay. Look, I'm not trying to upset anybody here. I'd just appreciate your help. - But this is lame. We were having a great time playing kickball, and that big baby had to up and run away. Why should he get to spoil it for the rest of us? - I think you and I both know the reason why Cameron left. And I want to talk to you about that. Guys, go on ahead. We'll catch up. - [Both] All right. - [Grayson] Look, the way you treat Cameron really upsets him. - Come on, I was just messing around. He needs to take a joke. - Well, Drew, obviously Cameron doesn't see it like that. And you need to cut it out. - Remember Jackson Williams, in your grade? - (slowly) Yeah, we were friends. What about him? - My older brother. He told me tons of stories about you. The kids you picked on, the pranks you played. So I know you weren't always Mr Perfect. Just give me a break and let me have some fun, all right? - You know what? You're right. But what Jackson probably didn't tell you is that we hurt a lot of people. Camille was one of them, and I am so lucky that she forgave me for what I did to her, because she's one of the best things to ever happen to me. Look, I'm still not perfect, and I never will be, but I try my best to treat everyone right. - I don't need this from you. I'll go find Camper Cameron and be back to camp in 20 minutes. Have fun on your nature hike. - [Grayson] Drew.

It's just how it is. - [Jessie] Yeah. - [Lizzie and Aubrey] Cameron! - [Sydney] MaryJake, my hair is wilting. We've been out here forever. Shouldn't we just turn back? I'm sure one of the other groups has found him already. - You think so? - [Sydney] Well, yeah. I'm sure they have. He couldn't have gotten this far. Oh, what a waste of good makeup. The gnats have completely eaten off my mascara. - We need to keep going, just to be sure. - No, wait. How long? (bright music) Two minutes? Five minutes? Please don't say 10. Wait up. (Sydney screams) - Sydney, are you okay? - Are you guys just gonna stand there? Help me. - [Aubrey] Here, Lizzie, get the other side. - [Sydney] Ow! - [MaryJake] Okay, Sydney, calm down. You must have sprained your ankle. - We should probably take her shoe off. My dad's a doctor. (unzipping) - That's right. Shoe off. - [Sydney] Ow, all right, fine. Please hurry. I think it's swelling. (Sydney cries) Ow. Oh no, look at me. I look terrible. - Give me your phone. I'll call Tyler. (Sydney cries) Sydney, it's dead. - Well, he shouldn't have taken it away from me in the first place, okay? I had a lot of messages to answer. - Okay, hang out here and we'll go get help. - No, please, no, MaryJake. Don't leave me here alone. Send them. - [MaryJake] I don't know. - It's okay, MaryJake, we can do it. Yeah, it's no problem. - Okay, hurry back and bring Tyler, or someone strong that can help carry her. - [Aubrey] Okay, we'll be right back. - [Lizzie] Right back. - And don't you say anything about Tyler. This is not a joke. (slow music) - Hey Bobby, can I ask you something? - [Bobby] Sure. - Do you know how to read? - Of course I know how to read. What kind of question's that? - [Man in red] Why couldn't you read the tent instructions? There were only like four steps. I saw it. - Yeah, well you didn't see what I saw. - Were the letters a little jumbled? - I don't know what you mean. - Or squished together or moving? - What are you talking about, Mikey? - See, the thing is, I have dyslexia. No big deal. So, I started going to this center, learned some cool new tricks. Stuff that helps. - Well I don't need any help. - Okay. - Did you know I've been held back, twice? (downbeat music) - [Mikey] No. Well, I kind of figured. You don't really look like a high schooler. - (sadly) Yeah. Well, I've got to graduate this year. If I can get my grades up, I've got a full ride to play football at State. - Wow, that's cool. - Yeah, real cool. But if they find out I've got this ... I don't know, problem, then they might not want me anymore. That's why I just can't go to any center. I've got to keep faking it. And I can't tell anybody, and neither can you, all right? - I won't tell anyone. But, maybe ... Maybe I could help you. Like, teach you some stuff. - What you mean? - I go to the center every Tuesday and Thursday. So maybe on Wednesdays and Fridays we could meet up. You could come to my house. - And what would you want out of it? - Nothing. I don't need anything. - How about some football coaching? - That'd be great. - We are to obey as we have been told. Our parents know what's best for us. - [Tyler] How are devotionals coming, girls? - [Anna] Great. - We just finished with this section. (quietly) Has Cameron come back yet? - [Tyler] Not yet. I'll try to send one more group out, because I want everyone back before dark. - Let me know if you need anything. I'll keep working with the girls. - Thank you. - [Aubrey] Tyler! - [Lizzie] Tyler, we need your help! - [Tyler] Is it Cameron? Is he all right? - It's not Cameron, it's Sydney. She fell and hurt her ankle. - She can't walk back. She needs someone to carry her. - Are you sure she isn't faking? She's been following Tyler around like a puppy dog all weekend. - No, I believe her. She was crying. - Real tears. - Okay, she me where she is. Can you find Sloane and call the others? - Mm-hmm. - [Tyler] All right. Come on, girls. - [Camille] I'll be right back. (light music) - [Mason] Wait, haven't we seen that tree before? Look. - No, that ... That's impossible. My Scout compass is always right. - Brant, this points south no matter which direction I turn. I think it's broken. - That's not good. - [Mason] Did you bring your cell phone, like Tyler said? - Yeah, about that, I don't actually have a cell phone. I didn't think we'd need one because I had my Scout compass. Okay, look, let's just, let's just pray. Just take a minute and pray. - [Voice in the distance] Come here, Bobby. - Amen. Either we found Cameron, or we're saved. Both good things in my book. Follow that sound! (fast music) - [Anthony] Look who decided to join us. - [Bobby] Yeah, we needed a few more players. Come on. - [MaryJake] Cameron! Cameron! Hope you're happy. Cameron's probably still wandering around out there and now we're stuck here, all because you couldn't put on a pair on tennis shoes like a normal person. - Give me a break. There was a time not too long ago when you didn't even own a pair of shoes that didn't have at least a four-inch heel, and you would not have been caught dead in a pair of dirty running shoes. - Why do you keep doing this? - Doing what? Reminding you that you're supposed to be my best friend? Not just someone who sits there and constantly judges everything that I do. - How can you even say that? You judge everyone. You do. Sloane and Ashlee. You didn't even know Ashlee's name, but you had something to say about the way that she looked. - Don't even act so innocent. I'm not the only one who was talking about her. - I know. I shouldn't have. I just ... I'm trying to be better. - Better than what? Better than me? - No, not better than anyone. Just a better person. I haven't liked myself for a long time now. - Yeah, well, that makes one of us, because I'm completely happy with myself. - No you're not. - Excuse me? - Anyone who is happy wouldn't treat other people so horribly all the time. - Here we go again. - [MaryJake] No, Sydney, I am serious. All you ever talk or think about is the way that you look or the way others don't look. I keep hoping you'll change, and I'm trying to help you, but I don't know how much more I can do if you don't see what the problem is. You don't understand how hard it is for me to keep being your friend. - Well, I'm sorry that you don't like me then MaryJake, because that's just who I am. - But you could do so much good if you just-- - No, you don't understand. There's nothing for me to change into. This is who I am. And this is all I am. - What are you talking about? - I am pretty. Not like that. I'm just. Just pretty. I'm not very smart. I don't have any real talents. I'm not very funny. And the only thing that people ever notice about me is how I look, so if I don't have that, I have nothing. - That is not true. - I know it is, and it's okay. I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry about me. - No, I am worried about you. (quiet music) You are so much more than a pretty face. You're a great friend. As much as you love gossip, you've never told any of my secrets. And you're fun. Remember that one time in middle school when we wanted to have a Slip 'N Slide but there was a drought, so we couldn't use any water? You had the idea to make 23 boxes of Jell-O and spread them on a tarp in your front lawn. (Sydney laughs quietly) Your mom was so mad and we were really sticky. That was so much fun. And yes, you are pretty. But you need to use it for good. Pretty can turn ugly really fast. I should know. ♪ Rejected, abandoned ♪ Not enough from them ♪ I've been defeated, ignored - So what can I do? - Oh, I know. Next Saturday, I'm going shopping with some girls from youth group. - Go on. - But it's not for us. We've raised over $2,000 for kids in the foster care system. It was all Anna's idea. We're gonna go buy brand new winter clothes for over 50 boys and girls, and we could really use help from someone with your fashion sense. - And from someone who knows where all the good sales are. Count me in. - [Tyler] MaryJake! Sydney! - Oh, no, I don't want Tyler to see me like this. See, I told you I wasn't very funny. Over here! ♪ How long can't you see ♪ This is what I believe? - [Grayson] All right, thanks for letting me know. I'll see you soon, okay? All right, bye. All right, that was Camille. Tyler wants everyone to return to camp before it gets dark. - Did they find Cameron? - [Grayson] I don't think so. She said Brant's group was already back and there's no sign of Drew. Man, this isn't good. - What do you want to do about it? - All right, I want you guys to head back to camp. I gotta find Drew and Cameron. I feel like this is all my fault. Do you guys think you could find your way? - Yeah, no problem. - [Grayson] Okay. - Oh, and Grayson? If you're looking for Drew, try the lake. If I know him, that's where he'll be. - Okay, thanks. - [Ryan] Good thinking. (maudlin music) (Cameron sniffs) (tense music) - Help. Help. Can't swim. Can't swim! Dear God. Please don't let me die. Thank you. (tender music) What's this for? So you can make a fat joke about me? - No, you're cold and wet. Just put it on. Cool drawing. Did you come up with that? - Just forget you saw it. - Look Cameron. I'm sorry. - Sure, whatever. - [Drew] This whole thing with me and you, it's nothing personal, really. It has nothing to do with you at all. - What's that supposed to mean? - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - I guess I was just trying to forget about things. - [Cameron] What do you have to forget about? Your life is perfect. - Yeah, right. You wanna trade? - Look Drew, I don't know what you're up to, but just leave me out of it. - My mom has cancer. - What? - Everything is all wrong. She keeps going through treatments, but they aren't really helping. It makes me so mad. She's back at the hospital today for more tests. And I'm here, having fun. And I feel guilty. - [Cameron] Wow, Drew. I'm sorry. - [Drew] It's not your fault. I'm sorry if I took it out on you. You didn't deserve that. - You know, there's something we could do. We could ... Pray for her. - My mom prays all the time, and look how much good that's done. - Well, it can't hurt. Dear Lord, watch over Drew's mom. Take care of her and heal her. And, thanks for sending him to save me. Amen. Pretty easy, huh? - Do you really believe that? - Believe what? - That I was sent here to save you. - [Cameron] Well, yeah. It's not like you would've done it on your own. - [Grayson] Cameron! Drew! - [Cameron] Grayson, I'm sorry I ran off. - [Drew] And I'm sorry too, for everything. - [Grayson] Guys, it's all right. Let's just get back to camp. Everything all right, Cam? - I think it's going to be. Thanks, Grayson.

(whooping) ♪ A place to hide - Cameron, we're glad you're back. - Seriously, we're glad. - Wow, thanks. - Lizzie, Aubrey, I'm really sorry I snapped at you earlier. And thanks for all your help. - Grayson Thompson, you're my hero. (laughter) - Hey Brant, where have you been? I was so sure that trusty compass of yours would've done the trick. (laughter) - Yeah, well, we found him hours ago. We just didn't want to show off, right? - Right, right. - [Tyler] Hey guys, settle down, settle down. I think we all know who was looking out for us today. And everyone's gonna be just fine. You all have one hour to head to the mess hall. Then back to the campfire at 7:00 PM. Sound like a plan? - [All] Yes. - Let's go. (relaxed music) Good to see you. - Hey, Anna? - [Anna] What? - MaryJake told me about your mission project and I'd like to hear a lot more about it. - Sure. It's gonna be so great. - [Brant] Well, it's definitely not perfect, but it's pretty close. All in a day's work. It's not even dinnertime. - [Sloane] Let's take a look. - [Sydney] Please don't say anything about my shoes. I shouldn't have worn them on the trails. I know. - (laughs) I wasn't going to say anything. I think they're cute. For the proper occasion. - So, are you and Tyler close? - [Sloane] Oh, Tyler? We're really great friends. We met years ago when we were campers here. Of course, my role was a little different because my parents own the place. He's just such a great guy you can always be yourself around, and he doesn't judge anybody. You guys are really lucky to have him as your worship leader. Okay, you're not gonna like this, but what size shoe do you wear? - Seven. - You're really lucky you weren't a size eight. My gift to you. I know they aren't much to look at, but I promise they will make your ankle feel a lot better real soon. A little arch support can go a long way. - [Sydney] Thanks, Sloane. Really, thanks a lot. (happy music) - [Camille] Hey there. - [Grayson] Hi. - [Camille] I figured the hero of the day would be too busy signing autographs? - [Grayson] Please. I didn't do anything. - [Camille] You did something. - [Grayson] Hey, can I walk you to the campfire? - [Camille] Yeah, just give me a second. Hey girls, I'm going on ahead. I'll meet you there. - [Anna] Sure, see you there. (slow music) - Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure. - Have you ever stopped to think about all the little things you do that can affect so many other people? - I don't know. Not really, I guess. Why? - Just talking with Drew and Cameron. I never thought about how much influence we have on kids, or anyone, for that matter. It's kind of scary. - It's a lot to take in. - I know. And when I first started to think about it, I got scared and worried. Like I'd mess it all up. But then I realized, it's actually a pretty awesome opportunity, you know? To take everything you say and do and then influence someone in a positive way. - Wow. My man's smart. Really, that's incredible. - It's hurting my head just trying to process it all. But seriously, I realize how much of a positive influence I want to be on people. - That's great, Grayson. And I want you to help me do the same. Only got one chance. - [Grayson] Yeah. - Gotta make it count. - We will. ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light on my darkest day ♪ When I feel so far away ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ When I can't find my way back home ♪ When I feel like I'm all alone ♪ When my heart is aching ♪ And my spirit is breaking down ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light in my darkest night ♪ When I feel like nothing's right ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ When I can't find my way back home ♪ When I feel like I'm all alone ♪ When my heart is aching ♪ And my spirit is breaking down ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light ♪ Be the light (solemn music) - [Tyler] Would anyone like to open us up in prayer? - I can do it. - Thanks, MaryJake. - Dear Lord. Thank you so much for bringing us all together this weekend. And just allowing us to create some amazing friendships. Please continue to live in us and through us, as we all leave this weekend and go back home and back to school. And again, we just thank you for all the blessings you've brought into our lives this weekend. In your name we pray. Amen. - Now, I know this weekend, it wasn't all that you planned, and that's okay. Let that be a lesson to live by. We make plans every day. What we're gonna have for dinner. What we're gonna do on a Friday night. But do they always work out? No. We need to remember that God has a plan for us, one that was put in motion long before we were born or even thought of, so when something doesn't go exactly according to plan, or not your way, know that it is part of a plan. It's up to you to trust God will lead you in the right direction. Now I know we talked about creating our own theme for this weekend. I'd like to go around, and whoever would like to, share their theme. You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. You can't be honest with God until you're honest with yourselves. Would anyone like to start? - I should focus more on others, instead of myself. - That's great, Sydney. Thank you. - Doing the right thing is not always easy, but it's the best. That's what I need to remember. - I'm not gonna care what other people think. I'm gonna do what I know is right. - Me too. - I need to admit my problem and accept it openly. - I need to love my enemies, no matter how hard it is. And do everything in my power to be kind of those who wronged me. - I need to admit when I'm wrong. No matter how much it stinks. - I need to accept that even though something feels like it's out of control, it's not. It's just part of a plan that I don't understand yet. - Anthony, you look like you've got something to say. - Well, yeah, actually. And it has a lot to do with the bigger picture that you're talking about, Tyler. The real reason that I came here this weekend wasn't really to be a counselor in training. Although, fellas, I must say it has been a blast. This will be the last youth retreat that I get to go on for a while. And thank you all for making it so great and leaving me with the message that I really needed to hear. I decided to join the army. Just like my dad. I leave for boot camp on Thursday. I didn't want to at first. I fought it. But it's what I'm supposed to do. So, pray for me while I'm gone. Oh, and one last thing. I heard something about boot camp and about the army that really concerns me. I heard that don't have any s'mores. (quiet laughter) I don't know what I'm going to do. - I think we can take care of that. (laughter) (contented music) - Thanks, guys, thanks. - [Anna] Are you busy? - Pretty busy (laughs). Done. Give me your overall rating of this weekend, on a scale of one to 10. - All things considered, a 10. But the fact that Sydney Graham took interest in my fundraiser, a 12 at the least. - [Camille] I agree. There are some experiences that just can't be matched. I promise this is the last time that I'll ask this, but are you sure there isn't something you need to talk to me about? - Yeah, I mean, I'm sure. It's just ... There's something. - I had a feeling. - It's just it's kind of embarrassing. - Don't worry. Whatever it is, I won't tell anyone. And you know you can ask me anything. That's pretty much the only thing a counselor is for. - Well, I wanted to know about you and Grayson. - Sure. What about me and Grayson? - I wanted to know if ... If you have ... You know. Have you ... - Oh. Um, no. - But you're old-enough, right? - It doesn't have anything to do with being old-enough. It's something special. It's meant for the person that you marry. - But don't you think you're gonna marry Grayson some day? - Well, yeah. I thought that Grayson and I might get married. But what if we didn't? We love each other, but I don't know where our lives will take us. We talked a long time ago, and we made a decision that it just wasn't a mistake that we were willing to risk making. So can I ask why you wanted to know? - Well, some people talked about it at school and stuff. (tender music) Some people make it seem like it's no big deal. I just don't really know what I think. - Well, it's part of yourself that you just can't get back. And it's not something that you should really throw away. Anyone who tells you that it isn't a big deal to them, probably isn't telling you the truth. - You're probably right. I mean, I don't have a boyfriend yet or anything, but I was just thinking how cool it would be if I did. - It's very cool. But you should wait to have a boyfriend until you find one who loves God as much as you do. I think about something that I heard in youth group. You're important to God, so you should be important to yourself. It's why I got this. - Are you engaged? - (laughs) No. It's a purity ring. It's a small reminder of a special promise that you make. I'm sure your parents would love to help you pick one out. They'd be really proud of you for making that decision. And it's a pretty cool ring if I do say so myself. - Thanks, Camille. I knew I could count on you. - See you in the morning? - Absolutely. - [Camille] Night. - Good night. - So what's your favorite sport, all time? - Baseball. - [Grayson] What position in baseball? - Pitcher. - [Grayson] What's your favorite video game (tinny music) of all time? - Okay, one more pair and I win. - Well, we're playing best two out of three, so don't get your hopes up. (knock on door) - I need to see Drew. Let's go outside. It's about your mom. (tense music) - (tearfully) It's my mom. Her cancer. It's in remission. - Is that good? - Yeah. It's really good. (stirring music) (slow piano music) ♪ I won't say I'm not scared ♪ I won't say I'm prepared ♪ I won't say that it's easy - MaryJake? Are you awake? - I am now. Are you okay? - So, how do you do it? - Do what? - You know ... Become a Christian. - [MaryJake] Oh. Um, you don't really have to do anything. Just pray and ask God to be your savior, and just believe. - So, you don't have to sprinkle water on my forehead or anything? - No. But you could get baptized next Sunday, and Pastor Allen would do it in front of the whole church, and your parents could come. - Soaking wet in front of the whole church? No thanks, I'll pass (laughs). - Well, I haven't done it yet either, and we could get baptized together. Just think about it. - I'll think about it. - Okay, good night. - Night. - The campfire was, in layman's terms, awesome. Out of all the years I've been to camp, I think this has been my favorite. Is it because I am now an authority figure, rather than a lowly camper? Perhaps, but I think it's because a lot of the campers really surprised me. And it'll be hard for them going back out into the real world and continuing to use everything they learned this weekend. About as hard as it is for me when I wear my fanny pack in public. You wouldn't believe the stares, but it is totally worth it. And I hope the campers will see that it will be worth it for them too. To stick through it. Doing the right thing is always hard, but that's what makes the rewards so great in the end. Good night. (reflective music) - [Grayson] Hey. I'm proud of you, man. - We all are. - You're making your dad proud too. - Thanks, guys. I'm really happy to call you guys my friends. - And we always will be. - Wait, BFFs? - No, BFL. Besties for life. (laughter) - [Grayson] Bring it in, guys. Bring it in, bring it in. - [MaryJake] Ah, I can't breathe. - [Grayson] I love you guys. - Hey Brant, where's that camera? - [Brant] Oh, here. - [Tyler] All right, get together guys.
