San-sheng. Father! How did this happen? After all these years, why has this seal not been loosened? Only by going back to the source can the taboo be lifted. I've spent my life tearing apart time and space, and you have to stop him from making the seal five hundred years ago. I am willing to go back in time and kill the Dragon Master for my father. This is the birthmark on his body. Just by killing him, you'll still be you. "Dragon Master, Dragon Spell" The devil is born from the heart, all laws come to the same purpose. Cultivate oneself with calamities, the earth and sky are boundless. All things are null, and all images are void. Within the four seas, every gods and ghosts are manifest. Calabash, come down. This place is filled with water demons' aura, how come there are only weak demons have shown up? Weak demons are also demons, just do whatever we can then. Prince! You are the Prince? Just by one punch? I've never heard that Long Guang-hai having such a weak son. I am not his son! One hundred years ago, my father was killed by Long Guang-hai I had no choice but to flee here with my old crew and people. I just wondered what is going on. Well, you misunderstand us. We're here to subdue Long Guang-hai. How about this? Let's use the Prince as a bait to hook Long Guang-hai. Forget it, just don't hurt the innocent. - Fine. - Let's go. Help! Luo! - Daughter! - Don't go! Father! Thank you, Master, for saving our villagers from being slaughtered! Please take a bow from me. Thank you, Master! You are welcome, Mayor. Come on, get up... Get up, all of you. Thank you very much, Master. But since Long Guang-hai knows our whereabouts, he won't let it go. I wonder what other demons will be sent. I will catch and subdue whatever demons I meet. Just let it come to me. It's coming so fast? Calabash! My spell... Prince, are you okay? Prince? Why can't I cast the spell? My mana is inside you! Hand over the mana of Xiu-yuan! It can't be done. I'll say it again, hand over the mana of Xiu-yuan. I really can't do it. How dare you still pretending! Hand over the mana, do you hear me? Hand over the mana! Or, I'll strangle you! Hold on, just a minute. My mana is inside him. If you do anything to him, I'll be involved too. Is that so? Sure. What are you doing? Stop it! Xiao-tian. By pushing the magic power to reverse the 18th acupuncture point, you can force my mana out of you. Master, it's not that I don't want to help you. But actually, my Reverse Scale have been destroyed by Long Guang-hai, so I have no magic power long since. What do you mean? Can't that Reverse Scale just grow back? You demon girl! Get up! Let go of me! Tell me, where did you come from? It is five hundred years ago now? Xiao-tian, do you think she is out of her mind? Xiao-tian? My father? So I really am in five hundred years ago now. The birthmark! Is he the Dragon Master? What is going on? Girl, how did you get Dragon Clan of Luo River's Dragon-bone Dagger? Who are you? I... I'm your distant cousin. Distant cousin? Why don't I remember I still have a distant cousin? What's your name? My name is San-sheng. We rarely meet, so you naturally don't know who I am. Calabash. - Do you believe it? - I don't believe it. Talking nonsense, what a bad lie. You have a crescent-shaped birthmark under your left rib cage. How do you know? I even held you when you were little, how could I not know? About this birthmark, I wonder if Long Guang-hai know. Yeah, right. People who know about this birthmark in the Dragon Palace of Luo River, I'm afraid a thousand men know it if not only eight hundred of them. No. Only my parents know my birthmark. She probably be someone close to us as she had known about it. Idiot. It's been a hundred years and you can't even get this little thing done. I sent my men to capture him as soon as I got the news of him. So what if you do so? What's the use of killing those old and weak? Yet you still let that Prince of Dragons escaped. Please forgive me, my Lord. Your Majesty... They are the twin demons of the Spirit Mountain who can help my lord eliminate and eradicate the remaining demons. I think you two know that what I am up to. Fine. I hereby give you three days to bring me the head of that Dragon Prince. Just for a mere Dragon Prince, there's no need for the both of us to go. I could have captured him by myself all alone. Don't you make any impossible promises and have me to clean up your mess at the end of it. Don't bluff in front of the Dragon King. It's not me who's bluffing, is it? Both of you are experts, I'm sure you won't let me down. Lady Snow. I order you to bring the Dragon Prince back alive, I will not be able to feel at ease until killing him myself. Yes, Your Majesty. My lord is about to success soon, the entire Luo River will then be under your control. What I really want is more than just the Luo River. Master Xiu-yuan. Master Xiu-yuan, I got a way to help you recover your mana. How? Until the Prince revives his Reverse Scale and regain his magic power, he will be able to force your mana out of himself. Didn't they say that Reverse Scale couldn't be revived? The Reverse Scale would just gone vanished once it leaves the body. But there is only one exception in this world. It is said that Master Chang-ji had subdued a Dragon demon named Brahma, It is so powerful that its mana doesn't dissipate after death and even coalesced in its Reverse Scale. Mastwe Chang-ji fears that the power of it will wreak havoc on the earth, he then decided to guard that Reverse Scale by himself forever. If we can get this Reverse Scale, I believe we will be able to revive the Prince's Reverse Scale. Since the Reverse Scale is guarded by Master Chang-ji now, is it that easy to get? There are many people in the world who want to get that Reverse Scale, but then become some unjust ghosts in the Ghostly Domain. And that is a dangerous place. Please think twice, Master. As long as I can retrieve my mana and subdue Long Guang-hai, I will not hesitate to go through immense dangers and difficulties. I am going with you. Prince, how can we put you at risk? Chief. Master Xiu-yuan has been kind to us. Getting the Reverse Scale will not only can I return his mana, but also restore my magic power. You all have been protecting me all these years, and it's time for me to stand up for everyone for once. Here's where we are now. Although I don't know why five hundred years ago that my father was with the Dragon Master, I have to find a chance to kill him in order to lift the seal that five hundred years later. If this map is correct, I think the direction is that way. Fine. Master Xiu-yuan just said that it is this way. Did you just see the way that girl looked at me just now? Don't you think it is a little... - Do you see that? - What an murderous look. You're just simply jealous about my talent and handsomeness. What? Don't you? I got to answer the nature call. Don't you think she looked at me in a really special way? With a killing aura. Who is it? So it's you, San-sheng? What is it? That is a long way to go, let's just get on with it. I didn't realize that you cared so much about my mana, thanks a lot. Let's go. It is nice here, why don't we just stay for the night? Is that good? Why are you sighing? My mana, it will probably be bygone forever. What are you doing? I now put half of my mana into this magic stick, you may have it. Are you insane? It's so hard to get to the level of cultivation you're at now, how can you give me half of it just like this? I don't want it! Don't be a sissy, will you? That's only half of my mana, things ain't what they were now. Think about yourself at the present, you're so weak now. You'll be dead any minute, so take it with you. Who says I'm weak? I am still so powerful now! What are you looking at her for? What's wrong with me looking at her more often since she's so beautiful? I remember you told me that she looked at you strangely. But I found that it seems like you're the one looking at her strangely. It's not weird. We all have a love of beauty. It's just like when you see a nice view, you'll look twice too, right? You must remember that you can have no emotions nor passions. If you ever have so, you can no longer have retrieve it even if you get back your mana. Yes, I know... I'm a demon hunter, why would I ever have any emotion or passion? Has anything ever happened to me all these years? Don't worry and rest early. What's on your mind? I'm thinking... Now that Master Xiu-yuan's mana is inside me, can I do something with it? Feel the energy inside you and slowly bring them together. It is no use. Whenever the Reverse Scale has been destroyed, the dragon demons will lost the sense of mana. I must get that Reverse Scale and recover my power, in order to protect Lotus Village and kill Long Guang-hai. You are the Prince of the Dragons, I'm sure you can do so. Evil girl, don't you try to seduce my Xiu-yuan! What's wrong? Are you all right? What's going on? They are connected by the mana. I don't understand it anyway, it is just that their bodies are being connected together somehow. Come on, figure it out at once. I am working on it! We have to get her to let go. Are you okay? Are you all right? Are you all right? I'm fine. I got it. Calabash, light a fire! Run! Let's go! I don't seem to be out of power to get you guys down now, just find your own way down yourself, okay? Are you serious? I can't believe that you left us both up here! It is not good, is it? Fine, wait for me for a bit. No... Don't you get hurt so badly? Just rest well down there. We're fine just the way we are. How can it be so good? Get up at once, what do you want to do? Come on. Are you all right? - I didn't hurt you, did I? - Get out of the way! Xiao-tian! Are you all right? I am fine. Thank you, cousin. Are you practicing magic or marriage? I know it so well. Give me your hand, it hurts! It is all my fault that failing to fulfil the Dragon King's mission. Well, indeed. So adventurous for the merit who then result in a loss of effort. It's not your turn to talk. Your Majesty, please give me another chance. Whoever work for me has no second chance. This is what happens when you make promises but fail to accomplish it. Bring back Long Xiao-tian as I said, or you will be just like her. Yes, Your Majesty. This is the Ghostly Domain where the village chief mentioned. It looks pretty dangerous. Are you guys really serious about going in? Just take things as they come, let's go in. - You really have a strong character. - I like it. Let's go. Is he Master Chang-ji? Be careful of fraud. What do you mean by that? Look at him, he must be staying here since long ago. He is about to decay, it will be fine. It's on fire! Just let it be and it good to have a light. - Did you do it? - Not me. Wake up... Are you all right? It's okay... Where is this? Why does it look so much like the netherworld? Nonsense, don't speak like you've been there. Who is it? Entering my Blood Sacrificing Ridge, devils shall born from one's heart. It's the Princess Demon, who uses the spirit of seduction to catalyze the demons of one's mind. If we are trapped in this illusion and not being able to break it, then we will be sealed here forever. I must get that Reverse Scale even if I have to die today. There is no way back as well as sequester oneself from the world. Whoever dare to trespass here are just seeking for your own death. What are you talking about What's the point of pretending to be a ghost? He is a man? What's wrong with ghosts? They are much more simple than the people of the world. They will only determine to take your life if they want to kill you. Not again! Xiao-tian! What's wrong with him? And what happened to you? It's not me, but him. He's under an illusion. Who are you? Who am I? Can't you tell? I am the Prince of the Dragon Clan of Luo River. Nonsense, I'm the Prince of the Dragon Clan of Luo River. Is that so? Do you deserve it? Someone unbearable as yourself, how dare you call yourself Prince of the Dragon Clan of Luo River! If my Reverse Scale hadn't been destroyed, I wouldn't be so weak like this. The Reverse Scale had been destroyed and your parents were being killed, yet you can only hide behind others for the rest of your life. Are you ashamed? Are you angry? Useless. I'll kill you! Do you want to kill me? Right, I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill Long Guang-hai and whoever look down on me! Do you want power? I want power. I need power. Give me your body and you will have all my power. By killing Long Guang-hai, you'll be the new Dragon King. Xiao-tian? Xiao-tian, please wake up. Everything you see is just illusion. Illusion? So tell me, what's real? He's smoking. Don't go over there. He's possessed by demonic energy and will be demonized at any moment. He shares the same mana with you, you will also be ruined with him if anything happens. Stay calm. I have an idea. What's he doing? He's going inside Xiao-tian's illusion. Xiao-tian, don't you get caught up by the demons of your mind. What's wrong with becoming a demon? Things always make sense with their own principle. All phenomena are illusions, no different with dew and lightning. Therefore, you should take them as so. Who am I? You are who you are. Neither have come from nowhere nor having anywhere to go. As if there isn't anything at all, things are just what in one's mind. Dispel! Xiao-tian, are you okay? I am okay. It was Master Xiu-yuan who saved me. No way, Xiu-yuan is still inside the illusion! By the way, if he can get in your illusion, which means you can get in his and pull him out, right? Hurry up! Alright. It is not working. His mana is inside me. He can connect with me by his will, but I am not able to do that to him. It doesn't help a bit even you're so tall, go away. Xiu-yuan? Wake up, Xiu-yuan! Xiu-yuan! Xiu-yuan? Xiu-yuan... Xiu-yuan... What kind of demon? How dare you confuse me! Xiu-yuan. As a demon hunter, how can you be able to subdue me with those emotions and passions? We are your desire and selfishness, how can you wipe us off just like that? A demon is a demon, why bother with all these nonsense? Don't waste your energy. As you ever still think about it, I shall always be there with you. So you want to be the top demon hunter? Well, you're just so close to losing everything instead now. Things have their own true form, all appearances are illusory. Realizing you ain't seeing the truth means that you are now immortal. Freeze! Xiu-yuan... Xiao-tian! - Xiao-tian! - Hurry up and give him some breath. What do you mean by that? I'd do it myself if I could. The Yin and Yang must be in tune, hurry up! But... - But... - What is it now? You have to think about it. If you don't get Xiu-yuan out of the illusionary realm, Xiao-tian can't get out as well. And we all can have no way out then! Hurry up! Hey... When did you wake up? It's been a while. Hey! We're back! He is alive? Don't be so rude! For thousands of years, many of the dragons who was trying to get the Reverse Scale have just perished here, all because they fell into delusion. You guys have come to this place after all your hardships show that your hearts are still pure. Master, may I ask that where is the Reverse Scale? Where is the Reverse Scale? You have been entangled with it for so long, haven't you spied out its wonders just yet? Princess Demons and the Reverse Scale? Reverse Scale? Princess Demons? All things in this world have their own hosts. But whether is it a blessing or curse to get that Reverse Scale? That is still not known yet. From now on, you will have to watch out for yourselves. So, are we going back? Sure! Does it necessary? Where is he? You are back? Are you looking for me? Calabash, get the vine! Calabash, get the vine! Got it. You now have that Reverse Scale, so Xou-yuan's mana could also be returned, right? How come I can't have the mana back? I have told you. Since you are with your emotion and passion now, there is no way to have the mana back. I'll keep it for you at the moment. So what should we do now? As long as I stay away from you, you have it back soon or later. Starting from tomorrow, let's go on separate ways. How could it be? Master Xiu-yuan, Calabash. So let's say goodbye then. Wait. Didn't you say starting from tomorrow? We still have tonight. - Come on! - Alright, let's drink! Can it get any worse? We have no money. Buying this cheap wine as such a top demon hunter, ain't you ashamed? How could you... It taste awful. Let me tell you a story. Great! Let's listen to the story, come on! Once upon a time... There was a Dragon King of Luo River who was being sealed by the Dragon Hunter, so he asked his daughter to go back five hundred years ago and kill that Dragon Hunter beforehand. That's right. Those dragons have the secret method of tearing through time and space. His daughter managed to go back five hundred years ago, but she then found out that her father and the Dragon Hunter were no enemies. Even herself, in her time with that Dragon Hunter, was lost gradually. She thought that Dragon Hunter was a good man, who should not die. It's a complicated story indeed. To choose between father-daughter bonding and morality, that's really hard for sure. So in your opinion, what should the daughter do? My opinion? I think that filial piety is the first of all good things, she should listen to her father. Just kill... The daughter thought the same thing. Such a powerful Dragon Master sounds like a top demon hunter. It's very like us. Right. He's very special. In his hands, there is a dragon birthmark. That's even more of a coincidence. Between this world, there are only two demon-hunters who have this dragon-shaped birthmark on their hands. - Yeah! - What a coincidence! It's this dragon birthmark. So you're the girl of that story. That's right. I'm the one. In other words, I am your father. Got it. Soyou're here to finish the job. Then do it. Are you insane? You love her so much that even to give away your own life? There's more, San-sheng. I'm telling you. We got your father's Reverse Scale back for you two! You ungrateful one! Let's go! Come on! Do you think I'm trying to kill you by telling you this story? Father! What's going on? These are the scales on my Father's clothes. I got it. The reason he didn't resist was to lead us to the nest of Long Guang-hai. - Let's go. - Okay. Chief! Long Guang-hai? Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief, wake up. Chief? Prince? - Chief. - Prince! I am sorry. I didn't mean to reveal your location. It was Long Guang-hai, who forced me with our entire village! - Prince, I'm sorry! - Chief, it's okay... Chief! Chief! Chief... That's it, Reverse Scale with the Ghostly Power. You have no mana with you now, are you sure about that? Do you still need to ask? You are still so useless and as weak as your father. I will leave him to you all. Are you okay? It's okay. Father! - Don't you dare to hurt him! - Father! Welcome to be buried together with him. Father! Come on. Give me your body, and you will have all my power. By killing Long Guang-hai, you'll be the new Dragon King. What is it to hesitate? Do you want to wait till all your friends are being killed then? Are you okay? You don't even have any mana, you're just here to die. What to afraid of? You said that I was the Dragon Master. I heard that you want to seal me, right? Father! He's been demonized! Father! San-sheng? If I die, will you be able to get you mana back? Don't die. If you're dead, the mana will just be meaningless to me as well. San-sheng? San-sheng! San-sheng! San-sheng... Xiu-yuan, you can't do that! He can't be sealed without the core of the Sealing Spell. Calabash! Don't do that, Calabash! Stars are moving, as the landscape have been changing. Even the Luo River is in drought now. Why can't you let go of your obsession just yet? Are you here to mock me? I'm here to ask you for advice. I'd like to know how the dragons rip through time and space. San-sheng? It's really you! Who are you?
