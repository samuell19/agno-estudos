Good morning. Good morning... You know, I really gotta fix these stairs before the inn opens. Let's worry about the rooms first. Honey, October 10th's only two weeks away. You know that, right? We'll be ready. I just love fall. The leaves are turning. The air is so crisp. I'll take any time of year, as long as it includes you. That is a good line. A little corny, but true. Well, it worked. Okay, what are we doing? Okay, I've got to drop the croissants off at the coffee shop, and then, I still need to get curtains for the guest room. - You know what I was thinking? - What? These beautiful planters here. We need some, like, orange and gold flowers... And some pumpkins. Of course. You can't have a b&b without flowers and pumpkins. No, and it's bucks county. Celebrating the season is the law. Who would have thought it? Thought what? I live in a small town, and people know my name. It's nice to feel like you belong. Like this guy... Yeah, but I grew up in the mean streets of Manhattan, honey. Being friendly is a big adjustment. Well, you seem like you're holding up really well. Well, I appreciate that. Look! Pretty soon, that's going to be you and me. I don't know about you, but I think I'd look better in a tux. Hey. I live to make you laugh. You know that. And it doesn't hurt you staring at me like that with those beautiful eyes. I mean, all of my dreams are coming true. The inn is opening. Jenny's home bakes is taking off, and whoever thought I would own a company? Well, I did, but you know what? I only proposed to you because of those scones. The best part of the dream was finding you. Six months ago, we didn't even know each other. Yeah, well, look at us now, right? I couldn't be happier. I know. Kind of have that effect on people. - Look at this! - There you go. It's got a lot of drawers for the guests. I really think this says "Emily's Country Inn." Look at that. It also says "expensive." Well, what about this one? Okay, wait. This one is perfect. Look at that. It's a little worn, but we can Polish it up. What do you think? This one... Says that "this is our dresser." That's what I think it says, too. High five. Love your work. I'm going to have to Polish this, though. It's a very nice piece. - Hi. - Hi. We're opening a b&b. I think this could be just perfect. A lot of my customers have b&bs. So I guess the competition must be pretty stiff, then. No, but it's a good time of year to open. People are traveling out to the country to see the leaves turn. It doesn't get any prettier than bucks county in the fall. I agree. I love this lamp. How much is this lamp? I'm actually having a special today... A free lamp with every dresser. Really? Thank you so much. I am going to give this lamp such a good home. Does she always get this emotional about furniture? Just over free lamps. Well, you guys are a lot of fun. She is. I'm still learning. No, I think you're doing pretty good. See? Doing pretty good. Pretty good. Something smells really good, and I think I'm going to try it. Go for it! I'm experimenting with pumpkin croissants to take to the coffee shop. Yeah. If you bake it, they will come... In droves. Good. My distributor's expanding, so I just want them to know that my little company can keep up with the demand. Well, back at the inn, remember the heater in one of the guest rooms? Yeah, it's on the Fritz. No. no, no, no, no, no. I can't handle any more fritzes. I have too much to do. Relax. I will have a sit down and have a chat with the heater. Yeah, but my to-do list, it keeps getting longer. I swear, I cross off one thing, three more appear. Well, I have a to-do list, too. I've got to go see Tommy about these knobs for this cabinet. This remodel was worth every penny... That we no longer have. Yeah, but I do love my new spacious kitchen that I get to cook in. I just want to make the be breakfast in bucks county. I think you have that title all sewn up. Thank you. I have to say, though, cooking with my ring, it's... it's pretty distracting. And I'm blind. Sometimes, I just stare at it, and I forget to stir the sauce. I placed an ad for the inn. What's more important, the inn or our romance? Come on. I'm trying to combine the two. Hello? Hi! Hi, yes! Yes, we have a room. When will you be arriving? And your name? Okay, then... That is great. We will see you then. Thank you! What? We just got our first booking. Awesome! Mr. and Mrs. Stanley will be arriving on October 10th. I'm so proud of you. She sounded so nice. And how can you tell? Well, she picked Emily's Country Inn, right? Good. On that romantic note, I'm going to go feed the goats. Okay. And I'm going to take another one of these. - Hey. - No. I just wish I had a few more planters. I want it to look perfect for the guests. Let's hope they're into goats. Don't give me... Come here. No, no, no, no, no. You're not going over there. Get off! Ricky, come on! Ricky! Brian and his flock have certainly a special bond, don't they? I got her. I'll tell you what she said, but it's confidential. Not your typical career path, from, you know, MBA to Wall Street... I heard you! I heard you... To goat-herder. Now the only stocks I have in my life are livestock. I'm just not sure yet what to do with my investments having a tail. Okay. Yeah. Musical plumbing and creaking stairs. Let's hope our guests like a house with sound effects, right? This looks just perfect. Yeah. The price was certainly right. You know what else I want to do? I want to get a little embroidered pillow on each bed that says, "welcome..." And I was also thinking some fresh-cut flowers for the nightstands. And don't forget the best breakfast they ever ate. These people may never leave. B&B's thrive on repeat business. That's true. What? Nothing, I just... My new identity as an innkeeper's taking a little getting used to, that's all. Do you ever think about your old life in New York? Sometimes. Sort of. I mean, I just miss the pace of the city. You know, it matched my internal speed. Wall street runs on adrenaline. It's just hard to slow down, that's all... But I will take contentment over commerce any day. And... are you content? I'm getting there. You know what? I think I should get a new tablecloth for the dining room table, and maybe get some new coffee mugs. Yeah. It's not exactly even, is it? No one will notice when I put the curtains on it. Symmetry isn't high on your list, is it? Obviously not. I'm sorry. It's terrible. You know, I've been reading this travel blog called "the out-of-towner," and basically, she covers the pitfalls of B&Bs, and... I don't know, I'm starting to think maybe we should spring for better WiFi service. Honey, the remodel just tapped us out. I mean, how much more a month are you talking about? This woman is really well-known. She gave someone two stars for a lousy Internet connection. Great. Okay... I'll tell you what. I'll do some research, and I'll try to get us the best deal. Thanks. I'd better go 'cause I have to drop stuff off at the coffee shop. You know what else? I've got to get new towels. Get more stuff. Bleed me dry. Good morning! Hi! Hi! Okay, so... I brought a few new things just to try and see if they would sell. It's our only income until the inn opens. Okay, I can't tell anyone until the ink is dry, but my boss is retiring, and I'm going to buy the coffee shop. What? That is so exciting! I know! And when I own this place, I will take all the Jenny's home baked that you can bring me. Thank you. October 10th's the big day. Tell all your friends. There's so many b&bs opening in bucks county, so we would really appreciate the word-of-mouth. I just hope that my cooking is enough to set us apart. Are you kidding? This looks amazing. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye! Hey, vern! Hey, hey! I saw your ad for the inn. Boy, you and Jenny have come a long way since you inherited that house. Well, an old lady writes a will, and next thing you know, I'm driving an old pick-up truck, and I'm hanging out at the general store. You were like a duck out of water when you came here. It's true. I still have my unsteady moments, vern... Little tugs of who I used to be, but every time I look in Jenny's eyes... Yeah? I remember that's the man I want to be. Well, keep looking. Well, thank you. Don't... don't... Don't touch? - I won't do that ever again. - Hey! Here's your better half. Hey, vern! Did you hear Emily's Country Inn is finally opening? You did well by her. That means a lot coming from you. Thanks. I see that suitcase over there. You going somewhere? I've got a niece in Philly who's getting married. Okay. Nothing I like better than a wedding. Well, we'll make sure that you're the first to know when we pick a date, 'Kay? I better be. All right, I've got to go pick up the rest of the fabric. Yeah, actually, I've got to pick up those knobs for the cabinets, so... Enjoy your wedding. Well, it's just a warm-up for yours, sweetheart. Thanks. Love you! - Bye! - Bye. Now, try not to mess things up while I'm away, okay? I will do my best. I promise. Looks like your ride is here. How soon they come. All right. Listen... there's a storm coming, too. What are you talking about, vern? Looks okay to me. Nah, I got a trick knee, and it hurts every time it's going to rain. You can call it my own personal barometer. Barometer. Here we go! Why don't you help me? I'm helping you. Morning, Trish. Hey! hey, frank. How are you? Good. Did you get my invoice for the kitchen counter? I did, yes. I did, absolutely, and... Actually, Jenny is making a delivery to her distributor, so we'll send you a check as soon as the funds hit the account. Yeah, that's fair. Okay. Tell Jenny I say hi, okay? Will do. Nice work, by the way. Thank you. This remodel is costing us every nickel that we've ever had. I guess I'll have to do the repairs myself. My condolences to the house. Thanks. Speaking of repairs, can I pick up those knobs for those cabinets, please? How's Jenny liking her new kitchen? You kidding me? She's a professional chef, man. It's like Picasso with a new canvas. So the inn's finally going to open. Hey, yeah, you should send some of your friends. We could use the business. That'd put me between a rock and my ex-wife. You care to explain? Gloria is turning my former home, with my big-screen TV and the backyard patio that I built myself, into a b&b. That house is pretty small. You mean the airbnb? She didn't say what type. I just know it ain't right. Yeah, good stuff. Hey, you and Jenny going to the music festival? Afraid not, man. We're too busy with the inn. You've got to come. My band's playing. It's our debut. You're in a band? I just put the kettle on, and the sewing machine is ready to go. Thank you so much, Alice. Just need to finish the piping on the quilt and the shams. I can't believe how much I still have to do before the inn opens. Well, this is nearly done. It's very pretty. You know, who knew an inherited house would come with such a good friend? Emily gave me a great neighbor. I just wish I had known her. I hope I do her house justice. You and Brian filled it with joy. The decorating is just gravy. I wanted to tell you that I saw a wedding dress I like. I saw it in a store window. Which begs the question, when is the wedding? I have too much on my plate right now to plan a wedding. We have to focus on getting the inn up and running, and, well, I'm also trying to expand Jenny's home baked, and my distributor expects me to keep up the pace. Well, you know best. The remodel also cost more than we thought. I can tell that Brian's really worried about money, and I just want to walk down the aisle when the only thing on his mind is him and me. That kind of consideration is how you make it last. Where would I be without you, Alice? One quilt and two shams short. Hey! what're you doing? Hey, babe. I am putting on this last knob on the cabinets, and then you and I are taking the rest of the day off, and we're going on a date. We are? The music festival in Buckingham. Well, don't get me wrong, I'm all in, but why there? Why now? Well... Rusty's, band is playing. Wait... Rusty the tow-truck driver? Yeah, that'd be... Yeah, that'd be him. He doesn't seem like the musician type. Well, I don't seem like the goat farmer type. That's true. I do pretty good, though. You're a cute one. Let's go rock out. I hope there's some '80s music. Come on, we can do it. Squeeze through. One less croissant, and I could make it! I am so glad we're doing this... Going on a date. Me too. You know, we went from strangers to homeowners to engaged. We kind of skipped the whole courtship, right? Well then, it's high time we do this, right? No goats, no worries, just the two of us. You know, we've never even been to the movies. Well, of course, because vin diesel and Meryl Streep have never been in a film together, so... Okay, I've got to ask you this. Buttered popcorn or plain? Buttered, but only if it's the real deal. Well, the real deal works for me. All right, thank you all for coming out. This is my band, Rusty and the breaks. Hope you enjoy what we have for you. Who knew? Man, they are not bad. You want to dance? I thought you'd never ask. You love your dancing. I love you. I never want this song to end. Me neither. I love you, Jenny. I love the rain. Dancing in the rain. I love you more and more every moment I'm with you. I hope the roof doesn't leak! It's going to be... All right! All right! I get it! Hey, how's it... How's it going out here? How's it going up here? I don't think roofing is my calling. You're doing a good job. How would you know? Yeah, that didn't work. Hey, I'm going to run to the coffee shop and drop off the pastries. I don't think those shingles are going to hold. I'm going to have to tarp them. I'm sorry. Good luck. Be safe. I will. - Please. - Okay. The house is a wreck. Thank you so much for taking me in. You can stay at my place for as long as you like. Yeah, good, 'cause rain or shine, Jenny's home baked has to be made and delivered. We need the money more than ever. My kitchen is your kitchen. Thanks. Hey. Hey. You know that tarp? Yeah, it got, blown off the roof. I'm sorry. Yeah, the roof sprang a new leak, and a leak after that, and another one, actually, so all those rooms upstairs are... They're getting wetter and wetter by the hour. So what are we going to do? Move. I'd laugh, but I think I'm forgetting how. That's good. Appropriate. Yeah, we should actually call this "emily's ark." Yeah. Turn it into a cruise ship. I'll be its captain. Thanks, Tommy. The couch is yours for as long as you need it. Thanks, Tommy. So how bad is the house? Well, all the upstairs rooms are all wet. Jenny and I have no idea what we're going to do. Well, I can help you fix the roof. I... man, I don't know what to say. Say good night. Good night. Night. Honey, my room is completely soaked. Well, all of our guests are going to need wetsuits. Welcome to Emily's Country Inn. My room's a mess, not to mention all the guest rooms. Yeah, I feel like my dreams are literally drowning. Hey, hey, hey. No, it's okay. Right, what's a little weather when you're in love? Do you remember this is the spot where we first kissed? I do. I guess every storm has its upside? We'll get through this. Look at this. "I'd rather be fishing." That's nice. A storm with a sense of humor. No, our sign! You think it's a sign? I think what it means is up to us. Let's see... You see? And I think it says we are going to be just fine. I still think it says we need a new roof, but... You know. Balancing books is a lot different than waiting tables. You know what, maybe we could help each other out. I mean, my kitchen is great for making breakfast, but I could possibly expand Jenny's home baked if I had a commercial kitchen to cook in. You can use mine whenever you want. No, I couldn't do that to you. The utilities alone would be crazy. I'd have to do something for you in return. This is some negotiation. Whose side are you on? Ours. Okay, how about this? If I provide the pastries for the coffee shop, will you let me cook here when you're closed? You're on. Really? Yeah. Being my own boss rocks. It rocks when it isn't raining. Our first guests arrive next week. There's still so much to do. I'm a little worried about Brian. I feel like maybe this is more than he bargained for. Maybe you should ask him. Yeah. Well, hello. You know, we've really got to stop meeting like this. Come here. Let me help you. Are you becoming disenchanted with a house in the country and opening an inn? What are you talking about? Honey, come on! No. I love this house. I just wish it were drier and open for business. Me too. Good. Sorry. Got a phone call. Hello. Emily's Country Inn. How can I help you? No, no, of course, no. Bucks county is lovely in the fall. Is it just for you? Well then, okay, Mr. Albert. We'll see you then. You are going to love it here. All right. Take care. Honey... This is good news. We have three guests and none of the rooms are done. They will be... You know, eventually. Okay, let's... Let's do the stanleys' first and then we'll do Mr. Albert's. Plan. He sounded like a really nice guy. Maybe he'd be willing to bunk with the goats. I'm going to have to clean these. What are you doing? What? it's just a moment of self-expression. A semi-gloss wish. Wait, semi-gloss? Yeah, that's all we have left, but it's water-resistant, in case we have another storm. By the way, tommy and I are going to fix the roof this weekend, I promise, so it never rains in our house again. Good. Honey, what are you doing? The drawer is stuck. It needs to dry out. Sweetie, it's an antique. And, well, that storm aged it another 50 years. Hey! Look what I found. Those must have been Emily's. Yeah, doesn't say much for her taste. I think they're very moving. You know, shoes say a lot about a person. Yeah, I think these shoes say she needs a new roof. You know, I just love finding little traces of Emily around the house. All I found was a rolling pin and a popular mechanics magazine. I don't know about you, but I think our benefactor was a very complex woman. She was lonely, you know, trying to fend for herself. How can you be so attached to someone you never even knew? She's family. Your mom's aunt was her cousin. That wasn't even first-string. Nevertheless... And I was the descendant of her caretaker, so forgive my irreverence, but honey... You know, if it weren't for Emily, we never would have met. All right. Point taken. You do know, legally, one of those shoes does belong to me. There you are. Thank you. I don't know about you, but I think I'm going to bronze mine. You do that. Might even try them on. Hey. Why do you have a toolbox? This? Well, let me tell you... I have a new rule. "First, do no harm." Yeah, it's the oath the doctors take. And what are you going to be repairing? Honey, the stairs got really wet. They're creaking more than ever. I like stairs I can hear. Really? Okay... all right. Did you break the stairs? No. I did no harm, but unfortunately, the creaking was incurable, except for, of course... The fourth step from the bottom. See? And one silent step before the big finish. You know what? I kind of like the variation. Do you? Creak! Creak! Just love me and love my toolbox. I do. Good. We eating yet? A phonecall? Hey, Harry. Hey, I got your message. What's up? Listen, you know, the inn's about to open. I just thought I'd put the offer out and see if any friends are looking for a vacation. I'll be sure to send them your way. How are you liking life in the sticks? Are you kidding me? It's great... I mean, apart from the leaky house and the lack of income... But you know what I was thinking? I'm going to do a little financial consulting. Just put up a shingle. I hear bucks county is teeming with mergers and acquisitions. Okay, you know what, I get it. You know, maybe I didn't think this thing through, but don't rub it in, all right? No kidding. Hey, I've got to run. I'm locking up this deal. You know what, Harry? Good timing... 'Cause I've got a goat to deal with. I'll call you later, buddy. All right. Coming, Gabby. You know, at this point, Tommy, you're five shingles to my one. My dad was a carpenter, and his dad was a Mason, so home improvements are in my genes. Yeah, well, my dad traded stocks. His dad was a broker. You can make your own destiny. Yeah, I just don't think it should involve roofing. What? Wasn't enough paper in your dinner? Come here, Gabby. Hey, Gabby. What's that? There you go. Yeah, that's the last of my resumes, okay? Eat up. Everything I thought I wanted to be. Well, I appreciate your sensitivity, yeah. Thanks there, Gabby... But I'll be fine. Why don't you share it with your babies? Why don't you share it with your babies? Come here. You know, Tommy's couch is getting pretty old. I'm not getting much sleep, so I can't wait until he comes over, and we can fix up this roof today. Yeah, we can finish those rooms, and Emily's Country Inn can officially open. Can't wait. What do you think? What do you mean, what do I think? Look at this thing! It's awesome. It's amazing. I'm running out of adjectives. It's harvest Berry waffles. You know, I'm going to die a very fat and happy man. Just hopefully not a poor one. That would be good. I just feel like everything's going to be great now. Don't do that again. You're always seeing the silver linings. Yeah, says the prince of doubt. What are you talking about? I'm a realist. No, you're a pessimist... With a lot of potential. Well, thank you. It's a good thing opposites attract. Definitely. - Hi! - Hi! That is the last of the fruit from my trees. Thanks, Alice. You can thank me with pie. We got another reservation for the inn. That's great. Yeah. You know, I've been reading this blog about b&bs, and there's just so much I want to do when we can afford it. There's a county fair in Warwick. You could sell your baked goods there and make some extra money. That's a great idea. I could make all kinds of seasonal stuff. I could just make every kind of pie, and who knows? Maybe I could make enough to buy a new sofa for the sitting area. I just want people to feel like Emily's Country Inn is a second home, you know? The sofa's probably optional. Your enthusiasm will do the trick. Well, hey, Alice! How are you? Hey, I'm going to make some pies and take them to the county fair. Sounds like a great idea. I'm going for a run, okay? My trail got washed out in the storm, so I might be a little longer. Have fun! Okay. Good to see you, Alice! Yeah. Is there coffee? There's always coffee. Those muffins look so good. Thanks! they're actually raspberry buttermilk. Brian howell? Hi, Roger. How are you? Dolling out muffins instead of doing mergers? Actually, no, I... Well... I inherited a house, and I moved out here to bucks county. This is my fiancee's booth. I'm just helping her out. Hi. You know, I heard about what happened at your last firm, Brian. That was unfair. I appreciate you taking my side, Roger. Thanks. Come on, daddy. Yeah, sure. You made me a lot of money. The least I can do is buy a box of those muffins. Here, keep the change. I owe you a lot more than that. Great. Thanks, Roger. That's... This is my wife, Laura. Hello. Hi, how are you? This is Jenny. Hi. And what is your name? Shay. Brian and I did a deal together a hundred years ago. It had been stalled. Brian walks in, and we closed in a week. It's luck. Dad, I want to go see the ponies. Yeah, let's go. Nice seeing you again, Brian. You as well, sir. Take care. He's a nice guy. Yeah, he was my very first big client. Any regrets? He's a very wealthy man. My only regret is not selling him more muffins. Bombarded. hi! I'm so proud of you. Thank you. You did all of this... And I'm so proud of you. Thank you for your help. Are you kidding me? People seemed to really enjoy them. If we didn't sell them, I was going to eat them all. Well, hello! Hi! Hi. Can you high-five? No? Yeah! Thatta girl. What a cute baby. You know, the goats helped me cut the grass. I think we'll be ready in time for the stanleys. Yeah. Looks pretty good in here, actually. Yep, now we just have to finish Mr. Albert's room. All right. I'm on it. You know, this innkeeping gig? It isn't easy. Break's over. Step aside, little lady. It's time I lowered this an octave or two. You know what? I like it this way. Let's just leave well-enough alone. Why don't you step back... Focus on those baked goods... Oookay. And let your man... Do what men do. All right. That didn't work. Hey, Harry. Kind of busy right now. Well, not as busy as you're going to be. What do you mean? You bumped into Bailey, Roger Bailey. You sold him a muffin or something? That's right. I have been trying to land him as a client. He wants me to bring you onboard as a consultant on a merger he's doing. Wouldn't it be sweet to prove your old boss wrong for having let you go? Brian? Yeah, I'm, I'm... Yeah, I'm here. I hear you, Harry. I'm here. Hey, between the two of us, we could have this thing wrapped up in a couple of days. Truth is, I could use the money. Do I take that as a "yes"? Yes. Yeah, you can... absolutely, you can take it as "yes." Thanks, Harry. Appreciate the call. Roger Bailey wants me to help him close a deal with Harry's firm. That's great. Yeah. I mean, wall street doesn't carry the same allure as it once did. I mean, I'm done with the bulls and bears. Prefer goats. That's good to know. Where was I? You were about to break the sink. Right! It's going to get serious down here. Hey, you guys. Hey, Gabby. Hey, what do I have here? Listen, I'm going to make sure to bring you some spreadsheets for dessert. Okay? There we go... And you beautiful babies, you guys behave. Oy... Look at me. Look at this. I'm going to be the only guy on wall street with goat hair on his suit. That's... You're certainly the most handsome. You're too kind. You know, you sure you don't want me to drive you to the station? Well, you've got enough to do. I'll be fine. The stanleys called, and they are on their way. I'm, I'm sorry I can't be here. No, it's okay. You'll see them when you get back. Yeah. Okay. Good luck. I feel like a stock broker going to a rodeo. Have fun. Hi, I'm Jenny. Welcome to Emily's Country Inn. Hey, I'm Nora. This is my husband, Wade. Hi. It's very nice to meet you. Come on. I'll show you to your rooms. Perfect. Come in. So, did you have any trouble finding the house? My GPS got a little confused. I made him switch it off. "Turn left, turn right." She never lets up. Yeah, sounds like my mother-in-law. Are you guys hungry? I'm happy to make you brunch. I'm starving. Great! Here you are. This is so sweet. Yeah. Red velvet pancakes, no less! You should be a chef. I kind of am. I sort of thinks of this as my little restaurant... With beds. Where did you work before? Chef Oliver's gourmet catering. It's in greenwich. He was a perfectionist, but I certainly got a four-star education. So where is this "Emily"? Will she be joining us? Only in spirit. She passed away, and I inherited the house... Me and my fiance, Brian. Where is he? He's on his way to wall street. Well, I have to ask... Where's a good place to go antiquing? There's a great little shop here right in danfield, and there are plenty of others in doylestown. Great. Well, this breakfast looks amazing. Looks like we picked the right place. Thank you so much. Enjoy! This merger would benefit both sides equally. Except for next year's projected revenue. I mean, yeah, of course, you can look at the numbers, or you can look at the big picture. Which is? Which is, the fundamentals and the technical analysis both show that this sector has momentum. This is at its peak before the fall if you sit on this opportunity. The time to act is now... While you have the market's attention. Looks like we're getting closer to a deal. Come in. I am so glad you chose Emily's Country Inn, Mr. Albert. Mitchell, please. I'll bring some fresh towels to your room. Okay. That would be fine. Okay, we'll be in touch. I think we'll be able to wrap this up pretty soon. I'm working on a new acquisition. I'd like you to consult on that as well. That is a great idea. Nobody bottom-lines the numbers as persuasively as Brian. I appreciate that, Harry. It would be an honor. Now, I'm late for a 1:00. I'll call you guys later. Sounds good. Thanks, Roger. All right, let's get you caught up on the Peterson deal. Yeah. Hey, look, I know Bailey can be demanding, but he's a good guy. It has nothing to do with him. Fact of the matter is, what am I going to tell Jenny? We're only talking about another week or two here, and everybody in the office commutes from Connecticut, or wherever. You can commute from bucks county. Slay the markets during the day, and tend your goats at night... You done? Yeah, let's get this. Why don't we go in your massive office and get me the Peterson deal. Honey? Jenny? Hey! how are you? I'm good. I've got to get to Casey's and start baking. Listen, before you go, I think there's something you and I should discuss. No. Is it good or bad? It depends on how you look at it, really. Roger Bailey... Asked me to help him close another deal. That's amazing! Congratulations. I know. It's not going to take long, and I can commute back every night. It'll be easy. It's great. You're okay with it, right? Yeah. Honey, listen to me. My life is here. It's going to be fine. This is just a way to make a quick buck. I just miss you, but... That's awesome. I've got to get going, though. Can you bring me back some of that Jenny's home baked so I can eat it on the train? Of course. I love you. It's okay. Bye! I have three guests! Congratulations. I finished these last night. I just thought I'd drop them off. Thank you so much, Alice. You know, you should stay and eat something. I made enough for an army. If you insist. This is some spread you put out. I'm so glad you're enjoying it. Where's Brian? Will we meet him today? He's... he's just in the city, doing one more deal, and then he'll be back for good. Well, I found an antique lamp yesterday that's part of a pair, so I am determined to find its mate. Hon'? I guess that's my cue. Happy hunting. Thank you. Good luck finding that lamp. See you later. You know, Alice lives on that beautiful farm just down the road. That's a very pretty piece of land. I saw it when I drove by. When I was a pilot, I traveled all the time. Now I just want to land for good, and maybe do a little bit of fishing. I have a boat docked at the lake. More trout than you can count. Well, if that's an invitation, I'd be delighted. Those pumpkin croissants are a huge hit. I'm so glad. All right, well, I'd better get back to the inn. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, no. The guests are great. I just hardly ever see Brian. He's been back and forth to the city all week. He spends more time on the train than he does with me. That's just temporary, right? Right. Yeah. You ladies let me know when you're ready to order. - Thanks, Casey. - Yeah, thank you. So what brings you to bucks county? Research for the "out-of-towner." I'm doing this series. Well, no, it's more like a warning about all these new b&bs that are popping up in the area. We do have a ton of b&bs around here. I know. I've already tried three of them. I was not impressed. Casey, do you know any good b&bs? Yeah, I know a great one. It's brand-new, and the food is terrific. Really? Which one is that? It's called Emily's Country Inn. Emily's inn... Maybe you should check it out. Yeah, maybe. Do you know where we could find a latte? Hi, Harry. Listen, tell him to run the numbers again, okay? Because I know I'm right. All right, I'm on my way. Are you okay? No, no, listen, this deal is in danger of falling apart. I've got to go. Okay. I miss you. I miss us. I miss you, too. Not now! What happened? Emily's Country Inn just blew a fuse. Who needs electricity on a night like tonight? I've never seen so many stars. That's the beauty of getting out of town. What did you do to these? Those s'mores have cognac and Cranberries and a little bit of almond extract. Gourmet s'mores. Where's Brian? He had to work late. How could you miss a night like this? Man. Tommy came over, and he checked it out, and said that three guests was just more than the worn-out wiring could handle. Okay, fine. So then, what do we do? He said the whole house needs to be rewired. Honey, the whole house? All right, well, what about our guests? I've given them candles and lanterns in their rooms. I don't know, I feel like we're spending more money on the b&b than we're making. It's... let me just... It's fine. Look, honey... I'm going to make enough money on this job with Harry. I'll put the lights back on. I just... The whole house, I mean... I guess I should wave you off with more enthusiasm, then. No... But I will settle for a kiss once I get back. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry to interrupt. Could we just have a few more candles for the room? Of course! Absolutely. You must be Brian. Yes! hi. You know, you are one lucky fella. She's an incredible cook. I am the luckiest man in the world. Thank you for being so understanding. You know what? I actually enjoy this. Wade isn't reading or watching TV, so we're actually talking to each other. Turns out we have a lot to say. Anyway, you two, carry on. I'm so happy you're home. Me too, baby. Come here. Hey, hand me those needle-nose pliers. This one? Yep. Stupid name for pliers. You know, this is my first day off since I went back to wall street. Is that what you did? Only temporarily. Enough with the knowing looks, Tommy. Jenny and I are doing just fine, thank you. You still've got that picture of your 'kids' on your phone? I'm the same guy, Tommy. I'm just wearing a suit to make a buck. Well... Don't let the suit define the man? You know, if you weren't so tall, I could afford to be offended. Hello? Is this... Emily's inn, or...? W-would you like a room? Although I should warn you, we don't have any electricity right now. Okay, well, do you think the inn will be fully-functional soon? It better be, 'cause I'm running out of candles. Yes, I am hoping that everything will be fixed by tomorrow. Would you like to make a reservation? Okay. Is it just for yourself? Yes. Okay, and when will you be arriving? Next Tuesday. You can put it under... Denise. Denise. Okay, great, we'll see you then. She's clearly an amateur. How's everything at the inn? Good. Nora and Wade are about to check out. I got another booking. I just have to keep those rooms rented. You know, I kind of feel like... Kind of feel like our money problems have forced Brian back to wall street. That's not what I want. What does he want? I don't know. Hi. Goodness... This view is so much better with you beside me. Man... I've got to tell you, Jenny, I was up all night monitoring the markets. I've been falling asleep on the train. Jenny, I don't know, but this commute's taking a toll, so... I thought I'd talk to Harry and see if maybe I could stay at his place... You know, just the week. What do you think? I understand. Do you? Yeah. Okay. thank you. Heck. I'm going to be... I'm going to miss my train. I will call you later. Okay? It's not forever, you know. I'll be home on the weekends. I'm okay with it. Well, I think we're going to get going. You know that little shop in doylestown? They're trying to find me a matching lamp. They'll call me when it comes in. Well, I hope you'll stay here. Of course, we will! We've had such a good time. Well, you are always welcome. We'll see you soon. All right, take care. Roger, I also factored in all the variables and the impact of currency fluctuations. You got Peterson back to the table. He'd only leave Dallas if he was ready to close. Good work, guys. Really good work. Thank you, Roger. I made the right decision getting you involved, Brian. Yeah, you did. Appreciate it, man. You, my friend, are making yourself indispensable. What're you doing? What're you doing? 'Kay. Hey... I've got an empty office at the end of the hall. No, no, no, no, no. This is only supposed to be temporary, Harry. I'm only providing a desk. The ambivalence, that's all yours. Enjoy! I can almost guarantee it's not as big as yours. Guaranteed. Hey, honey. Hey, I... I just got a call. Are you okay? My distributor was bought out by another company, and they may be dropping Jenny's home baked. Okay, all right. Just calm down. You'll find yourself another distributor. It's fine. Yeah, but it took so long to get that one. They want to have a meeting to discuss the terms. What do you think? See, there you go. They want to meet. That's a good sign, okay? Yeah, I hope so. I know we really need this income. We'll be fine. Keep your chin up. I love you. We distribute to supermarkets and chain stores. We don't carry many smaller start-ups like you. Our sales are really starting to increase. You'll need to step up production, which means moving your operation to Pittsburgh, where we have a plant. But... I think bucks county is a much better fit for Jenny's home baked. The personal association with the brand is of limited use. It's not just a marketing ploy. We can get you into more stores if you use cheaper ingredients to cut down costs. It's quantity over quaint in the outlets that we serve. So what do you think? I think you're confusing "quaint" with quality. I want to make something I'm proud of. Well, let me know how that works out. Jenny lost her distributor. No. Big financial blow, Harry. At least we have the inn. Well, and you've got this job. Yeah, which is why I've got to get up to the office. I've got a lot of work to do. Listen, have you talked to Roger about that meeting we're supposed to be lining up? Yeah, I have. It's all coming together. Good, 'cause I mean, we've got to nail this down, buddy. Hi! You must be Denise. Yes. Welcome to Emily's Country Inn! Thank you. Come on up. I'll show you to your room. We're so happy you're here. Okay, I... Okay. Two-story craftsman house. The room is rather small. It's adequately furnished. The bathroom's down the hall. It's an average view, just a barn and so on. Just in case you want to take a shower. I should warn you, though... The plumbing is a little... Musical. Is that so? Yeah, but it works totally fine. Anything else? How do you take your coffee? I prefer tea. Tea. Got it, great. I'll see you downstairs. Emily's inn is a bust. It's a very small chair. There you go. So... all of this food is just for me? Well, my other guest is out fishing. My friend, Tommy, may join us, but he's actually trying to fix the electrical outlets. Well. That smells so good. Please, have a seat. Tommy, this is Denise. Hello. Hi. I eat based on height and weight. You should try the blueberry scones. Okay. Incredible, right? It's delicious. Just wait until you try the crepes. This is... This is very good. You came to the right place. I can run the inn and keep Jenny's home baked afloat. You know that coffee-shop chain, creamacinos? That would be an ideal vendor for me. Yeah, I've been to the one in Warwick. I could do an entire line of cappuccino-flavored pastries. I've been experimenting with cupcakes and croissants all day. How much cappuccino have you had? I had to taste everything I baked. Why, do you not think this is a good idea? Is this the caffeine talking, or is this a good idea? No, it's a good idea. Okay. Whatever it is, it beats me sitting around, waiting for the phone to ring. You could always call Brian. I'm not the one who went away. You still at it? Hey, did you know the nikkei and the Dax are both way up? Come on, Harry. Could play in our favor. You want a beer? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Thanks. You know, you don't really look like a guy who's about to walk away from all this. You know... The truth? I'm confused. Confused is better than deceiving yourself. Cheers. You know, I've got a briefcase in one hand, and I've got a toolbox in the other. There's a metaphor you don't hear very often. That's not a metaphor. It's my reality. I say this with all due respect to Jenny, who you know I like very much. I don't see you living in the sticks. I don't want to lose her, Harry. This guy, the one that belongs on wall street? That's not the guy she fell in love with, Harry. What if this is who you really are? You can't change for someone else. That never works. Trust me, I've tried. Just ask my ex-wife. I'd rather not. I don't know, I... I don't know. I just don't know what to do. It may not entirely be up to you. Jenny may have doubts of her own. I can taste the cappuccino. Good. I'm taking all my samples to their flagship store. When will, Brian be back? Hopefully, the weekend. He's under a lot of pressure at work, so I try not to ask. Maybe you should go see him. The trains go both ways. Yeah, but he's busy, and I'm busy here. I can't just leave the inn. At least let him know how you feel. Casey, I don't know how I feel. I... He's changing. I just feel like we're being pulled in separate directions. Maybe he was trying to be who you wanted him to be. It's what I've done with everyone I've ever dated, which is why I'm still single. It's Brian. Hi. Listen, I hope I'm not calling too late. Is everything okay? No, it's not, Jenny. I miss you. I miss you. And I love you. Did I mention that? Not recently. Well, I do. I love you, too. That's really just all I wanted to say. That's enough. Can I call you in the morning and say it again? I'd like that. I'll see you tomorrow night. You've got to hand it to the guy... His timing is great. Yeah. He's great. Brian! Yeah. I just scored us an invitation to Bailey's party. Strictly a power-player affair. Are you serious? Yes, sir. Dude, nice work, buddy! Hey, listen, do you think my old boss will be there? I mean, I could use some professional vindication being fired for his mistakes. He'll probably show up. Bailey's parties are a networking paradise. That's awesome. Listen, I just want to thank you. Hey, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be able to redeem myself on the street. It means a lot. - Evening, gentlemen. - Hello, sir. Brian, I assume you're coming to the party. Absolutely. Wouldn't miss it. Good. Bring your fiancee. My wife was very impressed with those muffins. I will let her know... yes. You're becoming quite an asset, Brian. I've got to get home. Later. Good morning. Wish you didn't have to leave so soon. I know, honey, me too, but I've got to get back. There's some issue with the final draft of the proposal. I mean, the deal is close to closing and everything, and you know how wall street is. They're just... Actually, I... I don't know. Well, you know, I mean, there's always this social component, right? I mean, there's golfing, there's lunches and parties... You know, I mean... Look, okay... Roger's throwing this party after work on Friday night, all right, and it is a very big deal to even get invited. Now, I know you're busy... But I'd really like you to come. I'd like that, but I have guests. I can't just leave the inn. It's a cocktail party. You won't even be late getting back, honey... And Alice, I mean, maybe she could pinch-hit for you. Okay, I'll think about it. Just let me think about it. Okay. I love you. You too. Wish me luck. Let's close this thing, okay? Good luck. Be careful. You got it. I could use another lamp in my room, but there's only one outlet. Okay, I'll ask Tommy to install one. Okay, good. Thanks. Sure, no problem. Is he... An electrician? Well, he owns the general store, so he kind of just does everything. Honestly, this house would fall over if it wasn't for him. Is he responsible for the musical plumbing? No, that would be Brian's fault. He's my fiance. He'll be here tomorrow. You'll get to meet him. Okay. Bye. You know, two outlets would be better, just because people need to charge their phones. Sure. Yeah, I'll ask Tommy. Great. okay. Mitchell and I go fishing every day, then I make him dinner. It's been a long time since I cared for anyone. Alice, he seems like a really nice guy. He is. And he actually asked me if he could extend his stay... I think because of you. What's going on with you and Brian? I don't know. He wants me to go to this cocktail party in the city, and I'm just so busy, and... I don't know. It does kind of seem important to him, though. Well then, you should go. Yeah, but it's a park Avenue penthouse and this wall street crowd. It's not really my style. It's a party. Go have fun. Maybe that would help you understand that part of him. Well, guess I'm going to New York. You look very nice. Thank you. Okay, so I've left a ton of food in the refrigerator. Are you sure you're going to be okay? You bet. Alice should be here any time. We're going to be watching a movie together. Thank you for holding down the fort. I'm becoming kind of a permanent fixture around here. Alice and I are turning into... A lot more than I ever expected. Well, you're a great guest. I mean, if I had my way, you'd never leave. I'm going to grab more of those scones. Right. You have a good evening. Thank you. So... there was hardly enough light to read last night. Yes, I'm so sorry. Tommy just got here to fix it. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I'm just driving into Manhattan. I'll be back tonight. So you're leaving your guests unattended? Yes, but my friend, Alice, will be here. Alice? She's great. Hello, ladies. Are you off to the city? Yes, that... That was the plan. Are you sure you're going to be all right? I'll be around if you need anything. I guess... Yeah, that'll be okay. Okay. see you later let's see about putting that outlet in your room? Yeah. Two... if it's not too much trouble. No trouble at all. Okay. It's just a chair. So it's my room. Hi. I'm looking for Brian howell. And you are? Jenny fintley. Yes, Brian's expecting you. His office is right up the stairs. His office? Second door on the left. Great. thanks. You're here! Hi! Look at you! You look so gorgeous. Thank you. I didn't know you had an office. This is so nice. Yeah, I mean, come on, it's just temporary until we close this deal. I am so happy to see you. It was worth the trip to see your smile. Jenny! You made it. Hi! You look lovely, as always. Thank you. Is that... Is that new? This is new. What do you think? I'm trying to look important. No? it's too much. It's too much, isn't it? Yeah, it looks like I'm trying too hard. I am. I am trying way too hard. I am going to go home and change, and I'll see you kids at the party. Is this an audition, or a party? No, this is a night out together in the city. Okay? This is what I guess real money buys you. Look at that view. - It's beautiful... - Brian? Yes? I thought that was you. Hi, Howard. I heard you were back in the game. I'm pleased for you. You must miss him, Howard. With Brian, I always know I'm in excellent hands. It's good seeing you again. Thank you, Roger. Welcome. Jenny, let me get Laura. I know she'd love to see you. Great. I'll be right back. That's... Howard, my old "legendary" boss. Wait, the one who fired you? Yes, the one who fired me. Thanks for reminding me. I appreciate that. I am so glad you could join us. Hi! You make the best muffins I ever ate. That's very nice of you to say. Excuse me. Brian, why don't we go grease the wheels on this Peterson deal? I'll be right back, okay? Excuse me. All right, babe. Have fun. Thank you. So Roger tells me that you and Brian have a little inn? We do, in bucks county. That's an awfully long commute. You two should get an apartment in the city. Duty calls. Excuse me, Jenny. Sure. That looks... That looks really good. Can I try that? Of course. I can actually taste the tarragon. Sorry, I used to be a caterer. How'd you graduate to guest? It's a long story. Honestly, I'd rather be in your shoes tonight. It's not exactly my crowd. My feet are killing me. Good luck. I mean, look, we've made our mistakes in the past, but that's behind us. Nobody's perfect. You don't want to work with a team that's perfect. Come here. Come here... You know... Brian and I were at the same party, and we were a million miles apart. It's me and Daryl all over again. Except Brian makes you laugh. He used to, but he's never around anymore. Casey, I think I have to... I think I have to start thinking about what happens if we don't make it. What? No, it won't come to that. No, I've got to fend for myself. That's why this meeting is so important. How do I look? Do I look professional? You look like you mean business. Good. Okay, I've got my samples. We are all set. I even made a cupcake with the logo in the frosting. I tried one. They're delicious. Thanks. You certainly are persistent. That's a lot of calls and emails. I hope I didn't overdo it. I'm afraid all I can give you is 10 minutes. That's five more than I'll need. Okay. Show me what you got. All right, this is a almond and cappuccino croissant. You're not selling these anywhere else? No, I created that recipe just for you. They'd only be sold here. That's nice how you did the label. Thank you. It's white chocolate frosting. I'm impressed. Most of my suppliers are big operations, with cost and delivery that I can depend on. Those big operations, they had to start somewhere, right? I mean, kind of like you. I'm just asking for an opportunity to prove myself. I won't disappoint you. I'll start you in three locations, and we'll see how it goes. So we have a deal? You had me at the cupcakes. Thank you. Thank you so much. So they found my matching lamp... And maybe even a table from the same estate. That's great! Well, your room is all ready. What a view. Yeah, it's beautiful. Just going to... catch the dolphins' game. Where's Brian? He's enjoying the view in Manhattan. You must miss him. I was hoping it didn't show. You should tell him. Hey, it's me. Listen, Peterson had to go back to Dallas, so everything is in limbo. Including us. Brian, we have to decide what we're doing. Okay. I know, and we will. But I think we need to do it now. I miss you. That's... That's all I needed to say. That's all I needed to hear. Hey, hey. I have got to go home for a few days, Harry. And then what? I don't know. I, I really don't know. My cappuccino cupcakes seem like they're a hit. Yeah! That's great. And the inn is filling up, and... Yeah. It's all good. You know, I just... I picture things in my head, and they're... They're kind of coming true. I never pictured you being absent, though. Honey, I know. I mean, it's not something I pictured either. We've just got to work through it right now. Hold on. It's Roger. I've got to take this, okay? Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, of course. Roger. Hey. Yeah, no, I'm in bucks county. No, listen, listen. Harry can handle the meeting. Everything's going to be fine. Yeah, I just had to come home for a few days. Great, I'll get back to you. Thanks, Roger. Bye. Okay, sorry. Where were we? Brian, I feel like we're... I feel like we're right where we started when we inherited the house. Your heart is on wall street, and Brian, my heart's here. Honey, can't we just say my heart's commuting? I mean, I just... Yeah, but you're changing, Brian. What? Honey, I'm... Okay, you know what? Maybe, yeah. I admit that the pull of who I used to be is strong. I admit that, but it's not just for the money. You know, it's for the energy of the city, and the fact that I get a chance to do what I love to do and be good at what I want to do. No, I understand that. Do you? Of course, I understand that, and I want you to be honest with me. I am. We have to be honest with each other, no matter what. Okay. Then know this. I honestly love you... And the rest of this, I'll... Try to figure it out, okay? I don't want to pressure you. I know. You know, I want to spend my life with you, but... I can't wait forever. I know... And you won't. - Okay. - Okay. come here. So, Susan, you decided to stay. I'm reviewing Emily's Inn. What do you think? Meh, it's on par with the other newbies... Except for the food, which is excellent. Hey! Denise. Hi. This is my general store. Stop in and say hello. Maybe we could have lunch. If you have time. I... Yeah. yep. Yeah, I... I do. Great. Well, I've got to run. Bye. Who's your friend? I... I met him at the inn. Why did he call you "Denise?" Sometimes, I just... I check in under a false name, just in case anyone knows who I am. Well, he's very good-looking. Yeah. And very tall. Maybe he'll end up in your blog. Maybe. I just promised Jenny I'd finish painting the hallway. Are you going to be around long enough to watch it dry? Better keep her happy, or you'll turn into me. You pining for your ex? I miss my dog, and my big-screen TV... But most of all, I miss the way she saw right through me. Sometimes, you don't know how good you got it 'til you lose it. "A mechanic's guide to love." Words to live by, guys. He happens to be right. Hey, Denise. Hi! I just... I just came here to get some push pins. Okay, that's fine. Jenny's probably got them at the house. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. That's okay. I'm going to get my own. Okay. Hi. Hi. Push pins, right? Yeah. There you are! You're spoiling us, Jenny. No. It's just 'cause I want you to come back. You know, I don't know about you guys, but I don't think Jenny should limit herself just to breakfast. I think this should be a b&b&d... Bed and breakfast and dinner. What do you think? Yes! Well, I mean, that may not be practical, considering both of you are gone so much. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm doing a little work in the city. It's only temporary. Right, honey? I hope. Well, I don't know how you can beat bucks county. I know, right? I love it here. I mean, I love it. Don't you love it? I do, I love it. I love it. It's the most beautiful place in the world... I've got to take this call. One second. Roger! Hey, man. Yeah, listen, I'm going to have to call you back, okay? Okay, thanks. Bye. Sorry. Well, the antiquing around here, I mean, it's incredible. Call him, if you want to call him. It's fine. No, he can wait. It's not a big deal. What's going on? Why is he calling so much? Honey, we're doing another deal together, so, I mean, I owe him a little bit of my time. You're doing another deal? Yeah. That means you're going to be gone even more? Why haven't you told me that? Because it slipped my... I'm sorry. - Slipped your mind? - I'm telling you now. Look, you want me to apologize for trying to bring more money in here? No, I'm not asking you to apologize, but I shouldn't have to apologize for being upset that you're never here. Never here? I commute every single night! Brian, we never see each other! I miss you. We never see each other because you're out working on your... I'm... I'm so sorry. You did not come here to hear about our problems. Please enjoy your breakfast. Excuse me. Do you remember when we couldn't agree on a color for the house? I don't know what the compromise is in this situation. I don't think you do, either. Jenny, look... We can figure this out. We have so many memories here. What are you talking about? It's no one's fault... But... We're just drifting apart. What are you doing, Jenny? This just makes me sad right now. I think you should hold onto it... Until you know what you really want. Hey, I am heading to Lucas's for a drink. You want to come with? No, man. I'm just going to stay and work... But you have fun. Anything I can do? No, man, I'm good. You are good. The best. Hey, you ready to dazzle them? Yeah, sure. That's the spirit. How are you liking your stay? You need any help? I'm almost finished. Thank you, though. How are you doing? I'm okay. Relationships aren't easy. No, they are not. You and Wade seem so happy. We've had our ups and downs, but this place, it's good for us. I'm glad to hear that. Can I help? Thank you. All right. Breakfast is served. There you are. Sure. Jenny? I'd like to extend my stay again. That is so great! For how long? Well, that'll depend on Alice. It's really been good for me to be here. You know, I... I didn't really think that I would have much to smile about today, so... I just want to say thank you. You guys have been great. I just have one question. Does that mean we get another chocolate souffle? You bet. We all know this acquisition's going to benefit everybody involved. Right? the buyer, the seller, the stockholder... You guys don't need my opinion. Just look in the proposal there, Harry. Open it up. Take a look at the numbers. Right? I mean, that's why we're here. Let's be honest with each other. Because we're all going to make money. Sure, Brian. Everyone'll make money. I think what Brian means to say is that we have a very good deal on the table. Is that what you mean to say, Brian? Roger, the deal is fine. I'm just not the guy to do it. Not anymore. You all right, Brian? No, I'm not, Roger. I miss my goats. I miss my girl. Not necessarily in that order. I understand. I'm sorry, Roger. I'm a family man, Brian. I respect your choice. Good luck with the deal. Thank you. Harry. Good luck with the girl. Thanks. Hey, I speak goat, too! Yeah... Hi. Are you sure this is what you want? I've never been more sure of anything in my life. What I feel for you... Is priceless. Welcome home. Tommy asked me to be his date tonight and I have nothing to wear. You're welcome to borrow something of mine. I really like him. There's a lot of him to like. Yeah... Come on. Come look. Did you... Did you invite Rusty? He invited himself. I'm a man of few words, so... Let me simply say... I'm going to go put the champagne on ice. I just... I didn't have anything to wear, so Jenny told me that she could lend me something, and so I put it on, and I thought that maybe I'd...! I really like it here. Now, this is a grand opening. Hey, brother! Thanks for having us. Thanks for coming. We appreciate it. Jenny! My date just revealed her identity. Turns out her real name is Susan Barry, and she checked in to review the inn. What? She writes that travel blog, "the out-of-towner." I love your blog! Thank you. I didn't have time to get you a present, but I did write you a five-star review. "The house is deceptively ordinary at first. It takes a while to discover what a gem it really is. Emily's Country Inn is a magical place, and everyone lucky enough to stay there seems to find themselves falling in love." You know, that's... That's very true, 'cause, Jenny and I were an unlikely bet when we first arrived, weren't we? Yeah. Look at us now. This is where I proposed to you last time, and this is where I want to propose to you again. Jenny... I want to make you laugh the rest of your life. Will you marry me? Yes. I love you. To Brian and Jenny. And Emily, who brought these two together. Tonight would have made her very happy. You know, Alice? You're right. To Emily! To Emily. Cheers, everybody. You look nice. It's Emily's Country Inn and we're both single. I felt compelled to flirt. Anything is possible. I just wanted a moment alone with you. Talk about a happy ending. No... This is just the beginning.
