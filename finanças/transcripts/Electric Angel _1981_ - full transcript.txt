Fafana is a colossal nebula, whose time of life is counted in abahadays. Every abahaday has 12 airzibios. Each airzibia corresponds to 100 millions years. Every fourth airzibio of the Abahaday, a tiny being comes from the depths of the universe, whose name is Ahnaris. He flies for a little while over Fafana, and then he says "hfff". After that he vanishes, to visit other nebulas with which he maybe has similar relation His "hfff" impregnates the Fafana and keeps it in life forever and ever. Then it starts to ferment by orgasm of expectation and Ahnaris apears on time, to make "hfff". Innumerable abahadays have passed, until now. But this time, after Fafana has reached the limits of its endurance instead of make a "hfff", he makes "hthh". Why? Maybe we will never know. Did he do it on purpose? Unconsciously? Or because of a short-circuit? For Fafana, the consequences are tragic. Sharp nebulatic twitch, which leads to a kind of unstopable galactical epilepsy. As once I wove a garland, I saw Eros 'mong the roses ; So by his wings I caught him, And in my wine I dipp'd him, And took and fairly drunk him ; And now my limbs for ever Are tickled with his pinions, ?s once I wove a garland, I saw Eros 'mong the roses. She opened her breast like a fan and she lied down when the legends of the darkest cities rise. Only a denture rattled and the present got lost forever. At his old steps, remained someting from something else. The night blew the other branches and at the root of the tree, remained ashes. Prone, and with sugar on the lips was laid down, on the bright garland of love. The call didn't take long to be heard. The response of the foreign elements was lost and with craving, with fragant seaweed and with brilliant sighs, she came, unbridled and clean like a substantial and sustained nebula. Now they are both named Meropi. Karagiozi, the topic is what is woman. Hadjiavati, this topic is philosophical, because, when you ask me what is woman, my answer should be general and vague. No. The topic is historical It is philosophical and religious. Take for example the baker. Like he makes a nice loaf from the dough, so the creator made the woman from Adam's flank. So she is a creation. No. She is an effigy. What efiggy, you oaf? -Idol -What idol? -A construct. -What construct? Evil. Like my hand and my hump. -Really? -Really Hadjiavati. Woman is evil and takes thousands of forms So, isn't she an angel and deity? She is an evil angel and deity. And, as prophets say, she causes grumble at the bowels. Yes Karagiozi. Woman is a deity, and thank you for making me understand it. You are a good man, and that's why I told you. The little girl who excited everyone, doesn't exist anymore. She bacame a woman, and a mother, who feeds a baby. What are you doing? -????? -????? -Yes. I will explain you. ??? In a way, I beheave like my parents. their room was made of glass. When I was a child, I was wondering as like you. Now, I understood. Through glass you observe yourself. You ask me about the relation between the glass and the video. Well, video is a glass too. You record your behavior, and you observe it better than in the glass. Isn't it obvious? When I saw myself on video for first time, I found it funny. Glass is diferent. More personal. Is more poetic to have a bath in front of the video camera. Why not? It's a habit. It is a way to see yourself in everyday life, as you said. For example when you makeup. Or even to have a more general view of what you are. Through the glass, you can't observe your beheavor in its entirety. With video, you can record yourself without seeing. At glass you see your eyes and that's it. It doesn't allow you natural movements. So, video is a glass? Glass. I discovered and realized what I didn't ever suspect before. Of course, video is more recent. But don't believe that glass has an old history. We always return to our first loves We always return to our first loves
