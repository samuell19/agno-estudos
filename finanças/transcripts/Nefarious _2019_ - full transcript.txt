In your own time, Louise. Can you tell us everything that happened that night? - You getting up today? - Hmm. Lou? Lou? Look. Come on, babe... Go and look for something today, will you? We have to work around here. You're not on the easy street anymore. Morning, Daz. Where are you working today? Big house out in the country. - She still asleep? - Yeah. No, not now. I'm fucking late already! Sorry, I can't be all mysterious like her. Clive, come on! You're gonna be late for work. Put it down! What's the matter? Clive, what's wrong? Don't want to go. I hate working there. Why? What's happened? They all tease me. Oh, look, Clive, people can be nasty, especially when they don't understand people who are special. Try not to take it personally. It's their problem, not yours. But they're so mean. You have to try and get on in life, Clive, yeah? Make the best of the situation. Otherwise, you'll not have any friends. You'll just end up alone all day in your room. Come on, I'm sure it can't be that bad? It is. Look. Try and stick it out to the end of the week and see how it is at the weekend. Deal? But what about the bird? Oh, don't worry. I'll deal with that later. Did he deserve it? - What? - The bird. Do you think he deserved to die? It's just nature, Clive. Nothing deserves to die any more than anything else. It just happens. It's just the pecking order. So... stay calm, don't let them get to you, and I'll pick you up this afternoon, okay? Mr. Streuli. You work at Fitzgerald and Co. Can you tell us anything that you remember about October 30th, and how it might relate to your colleagues Darren Carter and Clive Winters? - Get out the way. - Shift it! - So, Jolene... - Jo. Jo... She was working at a big house out in the country? And that's the house you decided to rob, yeah? And what made you pick that house? Yes. Yes, I know. I understand. No. No, still nothing. Okay, well, can you get someone out today? Thursday? Yes. Yeah, I suppose so, yes. Fine. I'll see you then, then. Thank you. So... Nothing out of the ordinary that day in terms of Darren's demeanor? Well, there was that conversation at lunchtime that was a bit odd. Out of my seat, retard. Go on, get out. Micky, have a look at the cameras and see who was down at the forks end of day yesterday when you go back, will you? Sodding wing mirror's broken. Be coming out of someone's pay packet. Camera's broken. What? Which one? - All of them. - Since when? Saw it in the office. All of them. He's right. Power surge last weekend. Whole system was down. The boss is fuming! Seen this? Hundred and eighty grand for a fucking car? Not on your wages, mate. You'd have to win the bloody lottery first! I did. What? Scratch card. I won. Oh, yeah? How much? Twenty. Thousand. Yeah. All right, fucktard. Just like that time that you was in the SAS? Or like that time when you helped catch the gorilla that escaped from the zoo? I did. Twenty. Twenty thousand. Why you still working here then? I'm special. Special. You fucking got that right. Gonna get the money. Get the money. Waiting for papers. Got to do papers before you get the money. Thank you, Jo. I'll, uh, see you on Friday. Yeah. Cheers. So, Ms. Holmes... Mr. Carter came in to your office at what kind of time? Uh, about two o'clock. He said he wanted some milk. All right, ladies. Have you, uh, got any milk? We've run out down in the canteen. - Yeah, sure. - Cheers. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. You're welcome. Oi! And then Arick, my supervisor, said he caught Darren going through Clive's locker that afternoon. But you didn't see it yourself? And where is Arick now? Oh, I think he went back to Norway. So what did he tell you? What you doing, Dazzer? Just putting my stuff away. And when you found out that Mr. Carter had taken the petty cash tin, you confronted him? Yeah. How did he react to that? You're a twat. You can't be trusted. You're always fucking late. I fucking can't do anything with you. You broke the wing mirror, you tried to cover it up. You fucking can't do... In fact, I hear you tried to nick the cash box! What can I do? In fact, I tell you what, you're fucking fired. Get out. Go on. The fuck are you staring at, retard? So what were you doing during the day whilst all this was happening? Just hung out. Watched TV with Mas. So you didn't go out looking for a job like Darren told you? No. No, I didn't. So, you fired him. And then? You didn't call us at this point, because...? Well, what would be the point? You wouldn't have done anything. Besides, Clive's brother didn't want me to call you. Look, what's this all about anyway? Oh, my God! That was so rough. Oh! Oh, Clive. Clive. - Are you all right? - No. Dad. Dad. Are you going to call the police? No point. Fucking scrotes like him get what's coming to them. - Are you all right, Clive? - There, there. Shhh. Now, Jack, we know you're involved in this. How? Why the fuck should I tell you anything? Fucking pigs. Because, Jack, you don't wanna be in any more trouble than needs be, do you? You've already got a suspended sentence hanging over you. You wouldn't wanna jeopardize that now, would you? I ain't done shit, and you fucking know it. You got fuck all! So why not just tell us what you know? Was Louise a regular customer? I don't sell nothing! Then why were you at Mr. Carter's flat on the 30th of October? 'Cause the little mug owed me money. But you said you don't sell anything. So why would he owe you money? Why were you there, Jack? We're not looking to prosecute you, not today. You understand that, right? We just need to establish a timeline. There's far more going on here than you, mate. Mate... I just need... a few more days... and I'll get it. - A few more days? - Yeah. Yeah, sure, no problem, "mate." After all, I've been waiting a month already. What's a few more days, eh? - Yeah. - Eh? I can get you a few quid today, mate. Good. Well, that's a start. But what about my two fucking grand? Well? I tried, mate. Look. I'll get it, okay? I promise. Sit the fuck down. You'd fucking better, 'cause if you don't, I'll fuck both of you up, understand? Yeah. This... ain't coming off the bill. Two grand, three days. Got it? Yeah. So, Louise, your friend Jack tells us that he was owed money. A considerable sum. And that he came looking for it that afternoon, but none of you could pay him off, so he left. Can you tell us what happened after he left? What the fuck's going on? - What's going on, Daz? - Nothing. You owe him money? Yeah. How much? Two grand. Fuck. Daz, by when? Oh, don't pretend you weren't fucking listening. You fucking bitch. Daz, what the fuck are you gonna do? Maybe I'll put you out on the game, so you're worth. This isn't my fucking fault, Daz. It ain't fucking mine either. That fucking bitch. - Daz? - What? Where'd you get this? Some fucking dickhead at work got me sacked, so I banged him. This guy. It's where I work. What? It's my bosses' brother. Lives with him. Really? What do you reckon? Well, we know Clive and Marcus went home. After that, who knows? I've never seen anything like it. You know you really mustn't get involved, Clive. It's not your place. What did Father always say? Some people don't... Well, they don't care if you're special or not, huh? They're selfish. - It was my fault. - What was? He got sacked. What? The man who hit you? Oh. No. No, I'm sure it wasn't. Yes. I... I told him the cameras were broken, but they were fixed. He's always teasing me. I just wanted him to get into trouble. Yes, well, either way, you're not to go breaking up fights, okay? You're too precious to me. I promised father I would look after you. How can I do that if you put yourself in harm's way? There. It's a good job I did those two years at medical school, isn't it? So that I can look after you. Now I'm out tonight, had you remembered? I'll be back late. You'll be okay? Yes. I've got some new DVDs to watch. Okay. Good. There's plenty of food in the fridge, and, uh... You've got your phone charged? And I... I must go and get ready. I'll go to my room now then. See you tomorrow. - There you go. - Thanks. Okay. Louise... So we think we've pieced together most of what happened on that day. Up until the time before you left your flat to go and commit the robbery. What happened then? I didn't wanna do it. Yeah, and I understand that Louise, I do. And I want to reiterate, you are not in any trouble for anything. We just wanna understand what happened and how we ended up where we are now. Fucking come on! Let's do this! In and out. It's the only way we're getting out of this place, Mas. He's definitely out tonight? Yeah. The alarm's not working. And you've got the code to the safe? Good. Now, Mr. Hyne, this isn't the first time we've had to interview you about a serious crime, is it? Look, I'm just a taxi driver. I just dropped these kids off. I don't know nothing about it. On a dark road? In the middle of nowhere at night? And you didn't think there was anything unusual about that? I just drop people where they wanna be dropped, you know? How would you describe the demeanor of your fares that night? I... I don't know. I don't really remember. Well, you'd better start thinking, Mr. Hyne, 'cause this is a very serious crime we're involved with here. And I'd hate to have to revoke your license. They... They was a bit nervous lot, I suppose. Just here's fine, mate. Cheers. That's six pounds ninety, mate. Cheers, mate. So you got out the taxi. Yeah. Yeah. Where the fuck are we? Shhh! Keep your fucking voice down. Which way? About half a mile. Right, let's go. And keep your fucking torches off! If a car comes, just put your head down so they don't see your faces. Got it? Daz. We shouldn't... Not here. This is your fucking fault that we're here, you useless cunt. Don't fucking forget that. The brother's room's around the back. Jo, show us the way. Lou, go hide in the bush and keep watch. You see anything, call me. I'll flash the torch three times and we're in. And at this point, you were outside keeping lookout. Was that for the whole time? No? Not the whole time. Like I said before, I went round to see what they were doing because they were taking so long. But I didn't go into the house. We know from the audio recordings taken from the digital system in the house, roughly what went on from that point. Would you like to hear those recordings? To know what went on in that house? His bedroom's upstairs. Mas, go wait in the kitchen. Watch for the building at the back to make sure the brother doesn't come in. What if he does? Just fucking shout. What's he keep in here? Hey. What? Down there. - The fuck are you doing? - Come on, we're better together. - Are you fucking mad? - What? If we get caught up here, we're going down. Do you understand that, you thick fucking bitch? Yeah. I just... I thought... Is there even anything up here worth having? Then where the fuck is this safe? Downstairs, in the kitchen. You fucking wanker, I nearly shat myself! What the fuck is this? Biscuits. Yeah, I know they're biscuits, you fucking prick! From here? Put them in the fucking bag. And wash those crumbs down the sink. You fucking idiot! We're not here for fucking biscuits, Mas. Where's the safe? What about the retard? It's fine. He's gone to sleep. Let's just get it and go! - What's the code? - 2-8-0-7. - Oh, fuck! - What? What happened, Daz? - Fuck. - Fuck, Daz! Are you okay? Of course I'm not okay, you cunt! Ugh, fuck! It's a fucking shutdown system. You got the fucking code wrong. No, no, I'm sure! We gotta get fucking blood off. This is a fucking mess, Jo. You said there was money here. You said you knew the fucking code! We've got to get your fucking fingers out, Daz, focus! We, we could take the TV or something? The TV? The fucking TV? We're in the middle of nowhere, you stupid prick. How the fuck are we gonna carry a TV? And I've got no fucking fingers! - What about him? - No. No, he won't have anything over there. Yes I know, but can he get into the safe? But what if there's nothing in there? My fucking fingers are in there, Mas. If we don't get them out, I'm going down. And I'm taking you two cunts with me. And that's when I panicked and went to see what they were doing. It was just taking too long. And I was terrified we were gonna get caught. And you were thinking what? That they'd fucked it all up. You weren't far off. I just wanted to get out. So you went back to the front of the house to keep watch, like Darren told you. Why didn't you just leave them there? Go home? It was Mas. I... I couldn't leave Mas. I just wanna start afresh. I wanna forget it all. From this point, Lou, we have limited CCTV. We've been through it several times. So... they all went to the outhouse. Stop. This is wrong. What the fuck are you doing back here? You're supposed to be keeping lookout. What the fuck? So you can try and fuck my boyfriend? I'm not stupid. What the fuck happened to your hand? Keep your fucking voice down, will you? That man is a retard. You even said it yourself. This isn't right. None of this is right, Lou. But we wouldn't be here if it weren't for you and your fucking beak! So shut the fuck up, and go and keep watch! If he comes home and catches us now, we're even more fucked. But it's fucking freezing out here. Is that my fault? Go and keep a fucking lookout! Okay? He must have gone out. No, no. The lights went out. They must have been on timer, you idiot! What are you doing? Trying to find something worth fucking having. Wait. Where the fuck is he? Jo. Jo! He's a fucking mong. There's not gonna be anything worth taking. Stop it. Stop it! Face it, it's fuck all here, you got it wrong! Let's get the fuck out of here! What about the fucking fingers? We'll use the fucking crowbar! You're not gonna get in that safe with a crowbar, mate. I fucking know that! We'll wait until he gets home, and then we'll force him to open it. Wait. So you wanna go from breaking in to fucking assault with a deadly weapon? You got any fucking better ideas? They're not my fingers caught in the fucking safe. I'm not doing this. You ain't fucking backing out of this now, you little fucking weasel! You fucking came here, and your fucking fingerprints are everywhere too! Fucking stop it you idiots! Yeah? This is all fucked up because of you! Fuck! I don't know, serg, after that, we're just clutching at straws. The carnage in that room, it was, um... Well, I think it will be impossible to really know what went on. What does the autopsy report say? Get out the fucking way. What the fuck? Guys. Guys! Fuck! No! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck! Fuck! We're going down, man. We're going down! Jo. Jo, what the fuck are we gonna do? Jo. He's been fucking stalking me. He's a fucking psycho. Let us out! Let us out! Oh, shit! Mas? Mas? Fuck! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Jo! Fuck! Jo! Jo! Clive! Clive! Clive, please. Just... Just let us go. We won't tell anyone. Clive, please. Please just let us go. Clive, please. Please. Please, Clive. Please... Clive, what are you doing? Clive, what the fuck are you doing? Clive, what are you doing? Stop. Stop it. What the fuck are you doing? Jo! Jo! Jo! Now, Clive, just like we talked about, okay? Clive? Clive! Listen, Clive, you owe me this. You owe me. Remember? I gave up my dream. I was going to be a doctor. But I can't, can I, Clive? I can't because of you... Clive. Now... just like we talked about, remember? Hmm-mmm. Please, Clive. You owe me this! What the fuck are you doing? You're a fucking psycho. No. No. No. No, no, no, no. Sociopath. With violent tendencies and... attachment problems. A psychopath has no planning, no end goal. A psychopath kills without thought or reason, frivolously. I am not a psychopath. I understand consequences. I doubt you even finished school, so I won't waste my time trying to explain it to you, but when Clive has made his confession, I will be neither a psycho nor a sociopath. Merely an innocent bystander in a terribly nefarious and elaborately planned murder spree, committed by someone capable of being a psychopath... but with an impossibly implausible explanation of events. You're fucking mad. No one's gonna believe you. Maybe not. Regardless, every piece of evidence accrued will be inextricably linked to my poor, stupid brother. This isn't a plan I've just hatched overnight, you moron! I'm a sociopath, remember? This has always been my endgame. And besides, you won't be around to tell anyone about it. Your dim-witted friend in the barrel has seen to that. Oh, yes. The internal chemical burns from the acid fumes are already perforating your lungs. You have about 12 hours before you're no longer able to breathe. Fuck. Come along now, Clive, let's get this over with. It's what Father would have wanted, isn't it? For us to help each other out when we're in trouble. - Do you remember? - Hmm-mmm. My name is Clive, and I have killed lots of ladies. Lou. Lou, get me out! Lou, get me out! Lou? Lou? Oh, dear. Lou! You bastard. Why are you doing this? Well, I could ask you the same thing, Louise. Give me the bar, Lou. Lou, give me the bar. Lou, give me the fucking bar! You... You're an evil fucker. Now, now, you watch your mouth, my girl. You know I don't like to hear you swear. - What would your mother think? - Shut up, you cunt! Lou, give me the fucking bar now! Don't you dare speak about my mother. Tell me, what would she think about all of this? Hmm? You're disgusting. And you know what? I'm glad she's dead. so she never had to see what you've become. Uncle Clive doesn't deserve this. Louise, don't hurt him. Don't hurt him, please. He's your dad. Mummy wouldn't want it. Lou! Didn't you know? You got yourself caught up in some messy family business, I'm afraid, young man. You just walked into the wrong house at the wrong time. - Put it down! - Stop it! Oh, shut up, you imbeciles! You see, Louise here has some daddy issues that need ironing out. I suppose slumming it with you for the last two years didn't get it out of her system. No! My name is Clive. What have you done? My name is Clive, and I have killed lots of ladies.
