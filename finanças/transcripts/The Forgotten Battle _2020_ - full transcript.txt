JUNE 6, 1944 THE NORMANDY INVASION AFTER 2 MONTHS OF HEAVY FIGHTING THE GERMANS HASTILY RETREAT. THE ALLIES DESPERATELY NEED TO CAPTURE A PORT TO GET SUPPLIES TO THEIR TROOPS. BELGIUM BRUSSELS ANTWERP ANTWERP IS LIBERATED AND THE PORT IS INTACT. THE SCHELDT RIVER BUT ANTWERP CANNOT BE REACHED AS THE GERMANS HOLD THE SCHELDT. PART OF THE GERMAN ARMY RETREATS ACROSS THE RIVER SCHELDT. THE NETHERLANDS EXPECTS TO BE LIBERATED AT ANY MOMENT. What's going on here? Keep moving. - Just get rid of it. - Where are the papers? Hurry up! Everything must go. For the mayor. Take it. Go, go, go! Just throw it away! And stay with it until everything has been burned. Understood? I'll do the last documents myself. - Sir. - Yes. Go. Teuntje, would you help my wife pack? And I think you should go home afterwards and pack your things. What do you mean? Your father works for the Germans, no? For sick Germans and for sick Zeelanders. - Burn it! - Yes, of course. Those are National Socialists! You can't do that! - Guess what I'm gonna do! - Who do you think you are? Guess what I'm gonna do. Huh? Who do you think you are? Move forwards now. ELECTRIC BAKERY SCHOENMAKERS It's over, Teun. It's over. We got rid of them. Come on. The Canadians have crossed the border. Who was that man? Oh, no one Just some happy man. Hand me the camera. Give me the camera. Where are your liberators? Huh? Where are they? Idiots. We're still in command. Watch out. Hey, move! Idiot. Move out the way. Move! Back. Move back. Ah! Move. Don't just stand there. It was him! Stop! Teun. Teun! Oh, Teun... Hmm? Oh, hey. What's going on? There were shots. Yeah... there, uh, there was an accident with a couple of Germans. Is it serious? - Is Dirk home yet? - Haven't seen him yet. But when he gets home, stay home. It's chaos in the streets. - I'm off to the hospital. - Now? - They'll be needing me now. - But we... we are free. I know, Teun, you're right. We'll celebrate tomorrow. Okay? Dirk? NARVA, THE RUSSIAN FRONT 11 AUGUST 1944. You. Get up! Up! Into the trenches, now! Get into position! What's going on here? They're coming. Get in position! Quickly! Hold! Load. Now show them how hard you are. We won't give up! Lukas? Hey. Hey. Look at me. Look. You'll be fine. Stay low. Okay? Fire! Fire! Lukas! Luuk! Pull back! Shoot! Shoot! Get up! Lukas. Come on. Lukas! Luuk! Luuk! Lukas! Lukas! Luuk! Dirk. Hey, where have you been? Idiot. You could have been killed. Dad says we have to stay indoors tonight. You and Dad, you're sissies. Both of you. Ow. Not a word to him, okay? Maintain your low tow position. Remain directly behind and in line with me. Keep focused on my tail. Is everything under control, chaps? Over. You bet, sir. Have you asked yourselves how a glider pilot gets back, boys? He doesn't. Once you've landed in enemy territory, there's no way back. Hence the lovely nickname, a flying coffin. We are approaching 1,000 feet. Prepare yourselves for decoupling. Over. Roger. Over. It's right this way. Idiot. What? What the bloody hell was that? A roll, sir. It was a childish maneuver. In war, there's no place for boys that want to act the hero. Grow up. In war, you've got to be ready for anything, sir. Those are your words. My word was also to your father. I promised him I'd have you back for Christmas dinner. Alive. Yeah. There's no need to break that promise, sir. I can still come, sir. Only with your father's permission. You want to be part of them? Of that scum? Of those fascists? Scum. That's what they are! Trash! Get lost. Get! Get lost, you! Ah. Van Staveren. You're very lucky. We removed a splinter from your guts. Don't move too much. Try to sleep. Take a look at these guys. I wonder if it helps, idiot. Are you Dutch? How are you feeling? Ah. Are you lost? Oh, you're on holiday? I understand. In beautiful Russia. With its picturesque scenery and friendly farmers. Have you sent a postcard home yet? Dear Mama... A little card from the Third Reich. It's wonderful here. I love national socialism. I would happily die for it. Are you an officer? First Lieutenant Friedrich Fischer. Still. You should actually salute me, but... have a rest first. You've earned it. Hey. Liberation. What a delusion. The Germans are back, just like that. The Allies never crossed our border. They won't just give up on Walcheren. Three airborne divisions... 35,000 men in military aircraft and gliders will depart from 24 airfields, land in Holland, 64 miles behind enemy lines... with one objective. Retake Arnhem. Operation Market Garden. After which, we will regroup and continue in a straight line to Berlin. To put an end to the dark tyranny that has held Europe in its grip for nearly four years. Pilots and soldiers, the success of this operation lies in your hands. And with it, the fate of Europe. Good luck. - I'll see you at Christmas. - Yes indeed. Arnhem. This is really gonna happen now. That's the intention. Been training really hard. Reached my number of flying hours. You know what is meant by a sense of responsibility? It's been ingrained in me since I was a child, sir. That's not apparent from your last escapade. Or did you think special rules apply to you? You're not ready. And your mother will sleep more easily knowing you're on the ground. It's done. I can come. - Really? - Yes. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you, sir. Don't know how you pulled that off. But no funny stuff. All my father did was work. He grafted from early morning to late at night for... for a pittance. And that will never change. It will be exactly the same for my little brother and sisters. Is that fair? I never saw you as an idealist. Nothing will change unless someone does something about it and... - And I want... - Strength. - I want to be proud. - Equality. Brotherhood. I've learned something, Dutchman. If the lie is big enough... and you tell it often enough... then people start to believe it. Do you know who said that? Our Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. Are there any Jews in your neighborhood? Most were arrested at the start of the war. And? Did you ever see them again? There's your equality. The Jews, they're all criminals and racketeers. Does Chelmo mean anything to you? That's where they put me when they had no further use for me. The elderly, the sick, children... babies... Jews, yeah. I was the guard. There is no such thing as good. The evil... in everyone. In every one of us. Get in the trenches. Idiots. Bastard. Go. Ahead. Wim! Wim. Come on. Sit down. - Oberst Berghof. - Mayor Oostveen. What can I do for you? I am responsible for defending this island. I cannot let resistance terrorists go unpunished. Of course. If necessary, I will arrest all the young men who are registered here. Of course. I hope I can count on you. Have a nice day. I've heard from a reliable source... Early this morning, three boys. Innocent. They will be executed if the person responsible doesn't turn himself in. You know he didn't do anything! He was not even there. They're looking for the person who did it. You have to go into hiding. Dad has enough contacts. Dad works for the Germans. Janna can help. Janna? My Janna? Hi, Teun. Hey. Dirk has to go into hiding and... and you know where, he says. They're after him. Perhaps... - I know people. - Yeah? Who? How come I don't know you know people? Sometimes it's better not to know too much, Teun. So, how does Dirk know that you know people? What shall we eat? I would like two bread rolls. - Please. - White bread. Yes. - Delicious. - Three? - Hello. - Hello. Can I help you? One bread roll and two of those. Van Staveren... Volunteer in the navy? Assigned to the shock troops? Yes, Sergeant. I understand that you are better. Good, I'll... send you back in. You start next week. You're being transferred to Holland. To Holland? You leave tomorrow. Dismissed. Today's your lucky day. I made a call. You're getting a desk job. In Zeeland, in the south. Keep your head down, Dutchman. This shit will be over soon. And then you can start over. I promise. We're flying at 6,000 feet. Thunder Two to Thunder One, you are two miles to port. Thunder One to Thunder Two. Roger. Thunder One to Thunder Three, pick up the lead. Thunder Three to Thunder One. Roger. That's it. Nice and steady. Bomber to Thunder Two. Correct. Maintain speed. Thunder Two to Thunder One, cloud break ahead. Maintain altitude. Tow Plane Six to Troop Six. Is everything under control? Over. Troop Six, everything's steady. Over. The lads are having a bet, and who knows, this could be the last we hear of you, so I'm just going to ask. Is it true that Monty put your very young co-pilot forward for this job personally? You're supposed to observe radio silence, over. Is that the young co-pilot himself? We just want to know what it's like to have a daddy who's buddies with Churchill. You'll be sipping tea at Buckingham Palace when it's over. I'm more focused on the Jerries I'm about to kill, Tow Plane Six, over. All right. That's enough out of you please, dingbats. Keep your eyes on the job at hand. Ah, Henk, old boy. I do believe you are home sweet home. It's beautiful. It's Zeeland. It's a bit wet. - Steady. - Sit down, soldier. Stay on course. God. Keep it straight. Keep it straight. Stay on course. Stay in line. Blessed is thou amongst women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God... Pray for us sinners... Settle down, back there. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Tony. Tow Six, keep it straight, damn it. Tony. Tony! Talk to me, are you okay? Check the wings. Check the wings! The right one's fine. Henk! Check the left wing! Gone! My God. The left wing's damaged. It's gone. - Tony, the left wing is gone. - Release! Release, William. Hold course. It's stuck! The release is stuck. Listen. There's too much tension in the cable. You're going to have to roll it. Did you hear me? You're going to have to roll it. Henk, come forward now! I need you. You have to release. What's it going to take for you to release? - Release, now! - You need to focus. - Pull the release lever as hard... - What? Focus, Henk. In three we're going to go for a roll. You pull that lever as hard as you can! Okay. Ready? Three, two... ...one! Release! Lift it, Will! Lift it up. Lift it! Brace for impact. Brace! Dirk. Dirk. - Visser family? - Yes. Is your father home? He's on duty. May I wait here for him? Lovely. Tastefully decorated. Would you like a drink? Yes. Water would be lovely. Yes. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Your mother? Where is she? In the cemetery. I'm sorry. My troops were involved in an accident two weeks ago. Three of my men are in the cemetery now too. Practically kids. And that's your brother, I take it. Wim, right? Dirk. Ah, yes. Of course. Dirk. Good day. How can I help you? Dr. Visser, it's an honor to meet you. - Oberst Berghof. - It's a pleasure. What can I do for you? You may be able to help me. Fuck. Are you okay? Sir? We've got to get out of here. Sir, sir, I'm here. Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. All right, sir, I've got you. All right. Nigel. - Okay. Just get to dry land. - They've probably already seen us. Let's move out. Come on. Come on. Where the hell are we? It's been five weeks and it's only getting worse. It's very infected. I'll clean and disinfect the wound now and afterwards at the hospital, we can... remove the shrapnel. You are a true doctor. Passionate about your calling. It's very clear. Someone who does the right thing in difficult circumstances. Even if it requires personal sacrifice. When you speak to your son, ask him to report to our headquarters. Yes? - I'm turning myself in. - No. No, surely you're not doing that. Janna will help you into hiding. She promised. So go pack your things. If I go into hiding, Wim and those other boys will die. I have a good understanding with the Germans. - Perhaps if you turn yourself in... - No. - Teun, those boys... - What do I care about those louts? - But they didn't throw that rock. - It was an accident. I'll go to Berghof. I'll talk to him. - Negotiate. - With that man? Maybe he'll get a prison sentence. I know how to deal with them, Teun. And the liberation won't take that much longer, son. There's no other way, Teun. I think the Germans flooded this island on purpose. What do you mean, island? I think this one's called Schouwen. It's one of the smaller ones. How far is that from Arnhem? To Arnhem? How? We're never going to make it. Do you know how many Jerries there are? We don't stand a chance. Look at the state of us. Shh! See? They're already looking for us. Just let me do the talking, Teun. Follow me to the first floor. Ah, yes. - Mr. Visser. - Oberst Berghof. Please. It's good you're here. I take it you can tell me more about the fugitive terrorist. No. My son isn't a... No. It was just a moment... of carelessness. - It was an accident. - Yes. - It was never his intention... - No, no, we are here... to say... that he is deeply sorry. And we hope that we might be able to reach... a compromise? You know, I hold deep respect for people like you. Whether in war or peace, your moral compass always steers you in the right direction. I value that in my own ranks too. There's a job to do... and I try to carry it out with honor and in good conscience. But not everyone is up to the task. Very few people are as righteous as you, Dr. Visser. Thank you. That is why... um... my son wants to turn himself in, under two conditions. First, the other boys are to be released. They are innocent, right? And the second condition is that Dirk receives a sentence, naturally, but a prison sentence, a life sentence, if need be. Instead... Instead of... Let's go. That man is playing games with you. What did you say? That his... His night shift is about to begin. What did she say? That her father has to go to work. No, no, before that. She's afraid that you're playing games with him. You work for our honorable Mayor Oostveen, don't you? People like you and your father, I am grateful to those with such a great sense of duty. Dr. Visser, you've helped my sick and wounded soldiers to the best of your ability. Now let me help you. I have to sentence your son. There's nothing I can do about that. But I will ensure that his punishment is light. You have my word. It's for the best, Teun. It'll be all right. Under the table in the basement. Give it to Janna. Bye, sis. Thanks. I've found an address for Dirk. He can go there tonight. Do you know these? Dirk's been arrested. Please give me the photos. - I'll give them to... - To your friends? Yes. I'm sorry. But those photos are very important. You can have them if you and your friends rescue Dirk. Teun. You have to give them to me. I'll talk to them. I 'm coming. You can't. Tonight at eight o'clock. Here. Hey. Why have we stopped? We were supposed to have landed in Arnhem. In Arnhem? - That's a long way. - Yes. It will be over soon. Antwerp has been liberated. And the Canadians are already in Zeelandic Flanders. - What? - What did he say? The Canadians are already over the Belgian border. That's where we need to be. Uh, how do we get there? The Canadians are here? Yeah. And you lot are here. Here. So they are at the other side of the islands. Do you have a boat, here? Boat? A boat? It was seized. Being out on the water is too risky. We're staying here. The Jerries know we crashed. They'll be searching for us. We can't stay in one place long. It's too dangerous out there. Especially with... What? We move out in the morning. End of discussion. So you're his sister. Dirk should never have carried out an attack on his own. He threw a stone that accidentally smashed a windscreen. - I don't understand... - Dirk volunteered of his own accord. - He's 17. - We're all in danger now. Especially if he starts talking. We need those photos. You work at the town hall, right? I can arrange things. Anything you want. Russian stamps, or... Or I can steal documents. I'm looking for a map. A tide chart for the Sloe. Showing the dam and the marshlands. And if I find the map, you'll help Dirk? What do you think? Is a 17 year old still a child? Where were you at 17? At a training camp in Bavaria. Hmm. Was that your own choice? Yes. This boy knew exactly what he was doing when he joined the resistance. I feel sorry for his father and sister but I can't make any exceptions. What if it's for the Jerries? It's useless. Maybe we should give ourselves up. What? - Never. - We're not giving ourselves up. If we do that, we're as good as dead. I'd rather drown. That's easy for you to say, you're going to die anyway. Maybe, John. But not today. Now stand up. March out. Move. Okay, go. Easy. Easy. Good work. I'll go look for some food, sir. A steak would be great. Medium rare, please. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, gentlemen. No! - Yes! - Whoo! - There you go. Drink up. - Cheers. It's not bad. No, it's good, man. So, how many? How many? What are you talking about? - How many? - How many women have you had? A gentleman does not disclose such matters. More than three? Three? More than ten? What about you, Willy? Eh? Young squire? No? Of course I have. You have never. - Not even with the girls in Ringway? - Surely. Jesus, man. We're going to die in a week and you have never... That, that is most, uh... unfortunate. Um, I don't think there's anything worse than that. Oh, God. Yes. Leave him alone. I am not gonna die. Henk. Nigel? John. In the bloody night, John. They're gone. Bloody traitors. - The map, Henk. - It's in there. They took my life jacket. - So they took everything. - Boys, listen... They're traitors, sir, bloody traitors! Listen. I need you both to go and get us a boat. I'm staying here. I'll guard the house. Yeah, right. Sir, I'm not leaving you here alone. Yes, you are. Get us a boat. That's an order. We won't give up! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Stop! Calm down. No! You know what we want. No. No! Give us the names. No! Stop. Come on. Come on. Henk. Oh, God. You've got to be kidding me. I thought that Dutch people could swim! Henk... Fritz, look what I've found. Don't touch. Get your hands off me! Careful! There's water here. Let go. Come here. Come here. The things I bloody... Show me your hands. Damn it. Stay still. Call yourselves soldiers? If he makes another noise, just shoot him. - Don't shoot. I'm alone. - Shh! Easy. Easy. Let me go and I won't tell anyone I've seen you. Easy, my friend. I'll do whatever you say. Hermann? Hermann, who's there? Hey, Hermann! Hermann, what's going on? Hermann! Fuck. Keep an eye on him. - No, don't shoot. - Hermann? Hermann. Hermann. - Drop your weapon. - Shoot, William. It doesn't matter what happens, just shoot. Shut up. Drop your weapon. Shoot, William. Shoot. Take your shot. Drop your weapon. Shut up you... Put the gun down, please. Put the gun down. Put the gun down now! - Gun down. - William. - I don't have a clear shot. - Doesn't matter, mate. Squeeze the trigger. Just shoot! - Take the shot, William! - Put the gun down now. Gun down now! - Shoot! - Just shut up. Gun down now! Put the gun down! Now! Gun down! Will! Will! Will, you don't have to do this. Will! No, please. Please don't shoot. Don't. Find their addresses. As soon as possible. Five people, all men. If there had been more, he would have told me. He tried to act tough for the first hour. But then I increased the pressure and he eventually named them all. Good. - Arrest and execute them immediately. - Mm-hmm. And the boy? What should we do with him? No special treatment. Good. What? This is crazy. Henk. It's going to be our last chance. Let's get over. Just us. Keep moving. Don't look at me. Walk. They've made your brother talk. He's mentioned names. And Dirk? What will become of him? What will they do to him? Don't move. Go forward. Quickly. I said, don't move. Stand still. Hey. No. Please. Please don't. Don't move! Hands up. There's no need to sit down. It's a shame about the training camp. Wasted effort. Pack your things. Report to the courtyard. Dad! Daddy. They're going to shoot him. Teun, who said? What do you mean? - What can we do? - Easy now, Teun. Easy now. It'll be alright, you'll see. Get in. LOCAL COMMAND Halt, stop there! - Papers, please. - Yes. Go on. Oberst Berghof. I need to speak to Colonel Berghof. Oberst Berghof! Oberst Berghof. Please may I speak with you? Please! Please. Approach. Ready. Aim. Fire. Stand down. We need to get your map to the Allies. Otherwise everything will have been in vain. The German positions are on this side. Here. Here. And here. Your brother took photographs of them. The Germans dug themselves in weeks ago. Everything they've got is aimed at the Sloedam. And here, on the other side... are the Canadians. If they cross the dam... there will be a huge massacre. Their only chance is at high tide. There's a fairway here, through the mud... to the other side. So that they can attack from here. Through this same fairway, you can reach the Allies. I can't do it. There's a boat waiting in the mud. By the Cornelisse farm. Come on. Hey. No, wait. Hey. Stop. ID, please. You too. Go on. Open it. Get out. Faster. Come on, men. Up. Keep going. Faster. Keep going. Faster. Soldiers. You are all tired... sick, cold and wet. But we mustn't give up. Walcheren is our stronghold. Hitler's stronghold. They will attack us with all their might. But we will fight down to the last man. We won't give up. Never! Teun. Teun, there is no boat. Keep looking. Get out of the way. Everybody out. All clear. Bloody hell. - Hey. - Not now. Okay. One thing's sure, we're all going to die. Well, they're going to blow us to pieces. We'll just have to blow 'em up first then, won't we? Hey. Hey. Cheers. Yeah, no trouble. So, what are you? - Um... - Airborne? Yeah. English. And you are a... - Canuck. - Far from home. Yes. - What's your name? - Mm. - Bill. - I'm Will. Hm! Nice to meet you, Will. You hungry? - Yeah? - Yes. I'll get you some food, get you a new uniform. Now? Almost. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I should have stopped him. It's what he wanted. Thanks for coming along. Come on. Hey! Who goes there? Push. Push. There they are. Stay low. Stand still. Don't move. We're getting reports. The causeway's been blown. How bad? Heavily damaged. We can only get across on foot. And across the water? We'll never get across in our amphibian boats. Too shallow. Too much mud. We can only go straight on. That's suicide. We won't stand a chance. Certainly not without air cover. Prepare your men for tomorrow morning. - Don't think about it, just do it. - Yes, sir. Come on. Go on, everyone. Come on. Move up, gentlemen. - Come on. - Let's go. - Come on. - Move out. Come on. Get into position. Everyone get ready to fire. Get ready to fire. Get ready to fire. Get down! Get down! Get down on the ground! Ah! Move forward! Move forward! Go! Go! Move! Move! Shoot for cover. Keep going. Will. Come on. Will, we've got to go. We've got to move. Move! Move! Move! Take cover! Soldiers, spread out! Spread out. Come on! Bill. Ah! Get cover! Get cover right now. Check your weapons! Push on through. Come on. Push on through. Get that Bren up. Get it up. Fire. Fire. Push up! Push up! Load. Faster. Move. Move! Look out. Come on. Let's get out there. Marines, 8,000. Prepare to fire. Fire. Push forward. Move! Move! Bill! We've got to get out of here. We've got to go! - Keep firing. - Move. Move! Keep your heads down. Follow me. Here. Give me your hand. This is madness. Move! Move! Move! Move up. Hey! Joe. Bill. No! Joe! Now. Get him. Move it! Retreat. Bill, let's go! - Go. - Retreat! - We've got to get out of here. - Move! Fall back. Retreat. Retreat! Move, move, move! Cease fire. Cease fire. Cease fire. Take this to the major. Sir. We'll have an hour and a half before it dries up. How long until we can get across? We can cross in four hours. Then the water will be high enough. You'll come ashore here. We'll attack them and you'll hit them on the flank. I'll have my men prepared for the attack. Come. Quickly. Come. Quickly. Quickly. Keep firing. Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Stand up. Stand up. Stand up, now. No! Shoot. Shoot. Pull out. Go! Go! Go! Hmm? Move! Hey. Bill. Get in! Hurry up! Get out! Keep going! Keep going! Fritz, hurry up. Get in. Fritz, hurry up. Get in! Open up! Open the fucking door! Did you think we forgot about you? Lie down! Lie down! Ah! It's your turn. Huh? Hey. You'll be fine. Clear! On 7 November 1944 Walcheren was liberated. The Allied ships could now reach the port of Antwerp. The final offensive against Germany could begin. At the battle of the Scheldt 3, 231 Allies, 4,250 Germans and 2,283 civilians lost their lives. The Netherlands was liberated on May 5th, 1945.
