- Oh, man. - Man. Ton of bricks. Baby. Come on. Oh! I don't need your help. He's messed up. Kind of looks like you do, jacob. Just dust off your skirts and get back in the huddle. What was that? It's the sound of you crapping yourself. Uh, come on, man. Where you going? Jacob, we need even teams. Hey, jacob. Forgettin' somethin'? No, don't! Ooh, nice shot. No more phone for jacob. Is he going in? Jake, where you going? Jake, didn't you hear what happened to eric? You're a goner, man. You're a goner. Man, if skinner opens the door, he's gonna puke. Nah. The old freak's dog'll bark, send him running. That's not a dog. It's skinner... eating. But what's he eating? It sounds like a wood-chipper. Animals. That's why they call him skinner. Brings animals from traps in the forest and eats them alive in his attic. Don't do it! Jacob, come on, man. Come back. That's pretty creepy. Come on, jake! Hurry up! Come on, we got a game to finish. Dude, hurry up, man! Grab your phone and come on! Dude, hurry up. We're getting super-bored. Come on, jake. Hurry up. It's getting cold. Oh, man. Come on, guys. It's skinner. Come on, guys, the skinner. Isaac, just leave him. Hey! You! Come here! Jake! Jake. He's here. Skinner is here! I'm coming. Come on! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Oh, my god! My god! What did you do? What did you do? But, brother... ...and then he did say unto him, "you're not my brother's keeper." The lord cried out and said, "your brother's blood cries up from the ground." Do you know? Do you know the way? It's laid out before you, but you fought the way. You stumble and stagger like the dead. Sorry, I don't buy it. No, excuse me. I was there. Two old grandmas, at least, like, 89 years old, and they was punching and screaming. Right. Punching? Yes, punching. There were false teeth flying, blood on the bridge table. It was... really? Yeah. What were they fighting over? I don't know. Something about irritable bowel syndrome. What? Gross. Gross. That didn't happen, but thank you very much for trying it, mike. Yes, it did. Okay? I was there. Okay? Doesn't compare to the craziness in this town, though. This is true. Ooh! This is true. Do you remember, um, last week we had to save a kitten? Aw. It took all my policing skills. And the puppies. Pete, with the ear. Puppies were brutal. Puppies. Ferrets. I love ferrets. Car 17, we got a 154 on adams road at the city limit. Ambulance on the scene. Over. Ooh, a dead body. That should make for a colorful evening for once. 17, do you read? Over. Hmm. Uh, that's a 10-4, dispatch. We're headed to adams, on the edge of town. Over. Are you all right? Yeah. Just the sandwich? Yeah. Yeah, it was the sandwich. Sorry. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, guys, guys. Can we get back? There's nothing to see here, okay? Thank you. Bit late to the party, huh, samuels? Hey, I am the party. Back it up. Back it up, people. Skinner's place, huh? Saul peters. Only skinner terrified kids, which, uh, I take it you still are. Yeah, well, you know me, chief. I'm just a big kid at heart. Apparently, I'm not the only one. So what do you... You think he fell or... Hmm. Angle like that? Unless he fell off a plane. Who would do this to him? He wasn't exactly popular. We'll know more when the coroner finishes her report. For now, get inside. See if there's anything to disprove my fell-from-the-sky theory. Yeah. Is she okay? Yeah. Yeah, I... I think she'll be all right. Well, tell her to get her head out of her ass. We're supposed to be the damn police here. Right. Hey, chief, can we get these kids out of here? There's some stuff they shouldn't see. Allow me. You kids want to learn about pepper spray? No, no. That's all right. Nothing to see here. Go home! Oh. Oh, man. Ohh. This is... disgusting. Sad. Uh, some of these newspapers are really old. Groceries aren't so fresh! "A shocked nation. Iindsay checks into rehab." Mike? Michael? Who do we have here, huh? Nice shot! ♪ Chicken love you, doo-doo-doo ♪ hey, dudes, daddy is home. And guess what. Because he loves you so much, he brought you some... think you could call that chicken... Chicken. What up, dad? What up, isaac? How you doing, buddy? Sorry I'm late. Oh, hey, dad. How are you? Oh, I'm fine, jake. Oh, and another strike... think I could get a, uh, I don't know, a grunt in my general direction, sir? Look out. He's teetering. I think he's ready to go down. Nothing, huh? Ah. How about this? For every syllable I get, you, sir, shall receive a chicken leg. Hi, dad. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! "Hi, dad" will get you two, count 'em, two chicken legs, huh? Ah. Party on, garth. Excellent. Oh, and there's a... I'm telling you, it happened. Does anyone believe that story? Our grandmas wouldn't fight. They'd, like, bake pies for each other and then hug. Yeah, well, officer asher didn't believe it either. Excuse me? What, did you fart? Officer asher? Yes, isaac. Officer asher, my partner. I thought you'd be on a first name basis with her at the very least. What does that mean? What does he mean? What he means is that your dad and officer asher are friends. Is she gonna move in with us? She can't have my room. I'm not sure sleeping arrangements will be an issue, jake. Oh... okay. I'm gonna put the kibosh on this right now, okay? Jacob, what isaac is trying to say is that your dad and officer asher are co-workers. Right? And friends. I don't know, dad. I mean, you... you were home pretty late. Yeah, well, I got a call on the west side. Something bad? Yeah. Yeah, you know, uh, you know that crazy old guy skinner? Yeah. He fell down. He hurt himself real bad. Did he... is he... He's dead. Sad, right? Yeah. Thanks. Hey, yo. Pass that over here. I'm so drunk. Pass that over here. Pass what? Come on. Give it to me. Come on. There you go. Oh, yeah. I've been waiting for this night. I've been waiting all week to get out here. Have another beer. Swig on another beer. Hey, so who's got the marshmallows? Hey! Hey, uh... I think I just killed a squirrel. Iilah? Are you even out there? If not, I'm gonna... Gonna clean my shoe. Over here, baby. I've been waiting for you. But... What the hell? Boobs! Sorry, just... I guess I didn't expect to see you, well, that. I guess uh, I guess I did, but... Get out of here! Stupid. Let's get out of here. Grace? Grace. Grace? Grace? Grace? Grace? Grace! This isn't funny anymore! Grace! Aah! Guys, you're not gonna believe what I just... Aah! Yeah, and when I was born, the doctor found out that I had six testicles. Yeah? Yeah. You're not even listening to me. I'm sorry. I'm just a little distracted. Yeah, it's okay. I kind of have that effect on hot chicks. Look, seriously, don't worry about the chief, okay? When this case is resolved, she will loosen up. But, uh, the boys like you. That's nice. Becca, what is going on? Have you... have you ever wanted to do something and it just never seemed like the right moment, or you were afraid and just... Then you just didn't know what to do? Yes, I have. Become a ballerina. What? That's right, lady. You heard me. Ballerina. You know, dress up in a frilly tutu and tippy-toe across the stage, pirouette. I'm serious, mike. I don't know, maybe... Maybe there's something wrong with me. I just... I don't know. I just... I can't fix it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry. But hey, what... Whatever that is for you, just... just know that I'll be there. Okay? I promise. Yeah? Ballerina's honor. You're sweet. You should see me in my leotard. Mm. Good night, michael. Good night, my darling. Hey, bro. You're a douche. Yeah, I know. I didn't think you'd admit that. Dad's gonna kill me. What, because of your phone? It's a stupid phone, jacob. He'll be happy you're not sexting. You know him. He won't let it go till we tell him the whole story. Just say you dropped it in the toilet. What if someone finds it? You think it was our fault? What, skinner? Ju... Just get your coat. Coroner's report came back. "Consistent with blunt force trauma." Chief, this doesn't tell us anything. Tells us you didn't read the whole thing. Right. Ah. "Copper toxicity." That's not it. Um... "cardiac markers"? Bingo. Yes. Okay, wait a minute. So the guy had a heart attack and then broke his neck? Get a load of his tramp stamp. Ooh. Creepy guys gone wild, huh? Sexy! Does that mean anything to you? Some kind of occult symbol. It's in the doc. Mark of cain. And it's not ink. It's a scar. I guess he shouldn't have pledged delta. Because it's... Ahem. Anyway, uh, any next of kin? Because that house is a mess. It's gonna need cleaning up. Public records are on your desk. Have at it. Right. What? You two aren't friends? Man. It smells like somebody ate a landfill and took a dump. Quit it. Let's find my phone and get out of here. Aw. Nothing here's gonna bite you, you wuss. Isaac? Here for you, man! Oh, man. Skinner won the nobel prize. That's a medal of honor, idiot. Yeah, what you get for being noble. Hey, there. Can I help you? Hi, y'all. So sorry for your loss. Yeah, bummer. Well, uh, a token of our sympathy. Tater tot casserole. It's great comfort food. Oh, thanks. Um, my husband and I, we live next door in the cute federal with the matching priuses in the drive. Super. Thanks for the food. Well, uh, just wondering what your plans are with the house. Uh, it's really too early to say. We... we just lost our... Step-grandpa. Step-grandpa. How's that work? Well, he... he married our... Other grandpa. It's just if you were planning to sell, we'd be happy to take the place off your hands. Um, should I be talking to your parents or a gay grandpa? Whatever? Grandpa's what? Listen, uh, I'm sure you'd love to tear this place down and build a tennis court. Japanese garden. We just lost our gay step-grandpa. Leave us alone. But j... I just wanted to see the house and the... Tater tots, man. Uh, what's wrong? This was on the steps. Go away! Franklin? I told you... Oh. I didn't do nothing. Franklin, it's me. I don't know you. So? Your brother? Not anymore, no. Saul's a monster. Wait! He... he was my father. Becky? It's rebecca now. I don't want to talk. Wait. Your brother, my father, he passed away last night. Are you sure? Yeah. Franklin! Franklin! Rebecca? Huh. Yeah, hey, uh, bec. It's, um, it's 10:00. No sign of you yet. I, um, just want to make sure you're okay. Look, uh, whatever you're going through, I just want you to know I'm here for you. Oh, and, uh, I think the chief... Hi, chief. Hey. Where's your partner? Uh, she's... on her way. Better be. I just got off the phone with a hysterical mother. Says her son didn't come home last night. One of the kids we chased away from the scene. I asked for the names of his friends, called their parents. None of them came home. Yeah, well, they're teenagers. Could be out in the forest building bongs out of pine cones. Or we could be dealing with something bad. Get your crap. Get my crap. Okay, gentlemen, let's fan out. Channel 2 on the walkies, and hey, guys, stay in contact. We're looking for any sign of them, where they've been, what they've been doing. Now let's go. What? So teeth just fell out of his head? Skinner was an old dude. Aw, come on. It's not even a human tooth. Blow the phone. Could we just go home? Listen for it. Hi, there. Is someone out here? It's just if you're the one who's been pooping in my azaleas, I'd like you to stop, please. And also, you should be seeing a doctor. It shouldn't look that color. Mom! Something's under my bed. Damn it. Coming, sweetheart. Okay, fine. Let's go. Hey, wait. We gotta look through the rest of this stuff. We're not robbing him. What does it matter? He's dead. And if anybody cared about him, they'd have been here by now. This is wrong. Could we get some gogurt or something to get him to shut the hell up? Douche. What? You heard me. Are you gonna run off to your mom now, too? Oh, wait. She's dead. Jake. Come on, man. Jake, come on, man. You... you can't walk home by yourself. Oh, come on and stop being a little bitch! Oh. What the hell is this? Are you all right? Uh... right. Uh, kid, I'm gonna get you down from there. What's your name? Aaron. Aaron, okay. My name's officer samuels, and I want you... I want you to get ready. Okay? Because this is gonna hurt a little. No, don't! No! Ouch. The adamine relic will be mine. Never. I'll have your guts for garters, you yellow bel... What are you idiots doing? Winning? You know this is a crime scene, right? Well, you must because there's police tape outside. I'm... we're really sorry. We're... we're leaving right now. Isaac, what were you thinking? Are you two related? She's screwing my dad. Oh. This is getting kind of awkward. I'm just gonna head out. You're not going anywhere. You gonna let me go, too? That depends on what you were doing here. It was nothing. Zorro threw jake's phone through the window. Is jake here? No, he went home. What the hell is this? Huh. It looks like a thing they mark cows with. A brand. You think that's for what I think it was for? What? Well, skinner had his own brand of rabbit steaks and deer steaks and... and dog steaks. You believe everything you hear at recess? Come on. Don't tell me you weren't scared of this guy as a kid. I think you should go home, isaac. What is that? A coin. He collected things? Never thought of him as someone who had interests or hobbies. I'm sorry. Did... did you know skinner? Do you hear that? Yeah. Damn it. Isaac, go home now. Mike. Hey. Mike, you okay? I'm fine. But it's not me we need to worry about. The rest of those kids are still out there, and there's no sign of them, but he says they're all dead. Oh, no. Who are we looking for? Big, really big. Uh, possibly some facial disfigurement. The kid said the guy came out of the woods, right? But he didn't have a weapon. Says he used his hands. Says he t-tore them apart with his bare hands. What? Said he ran. He didn't get far, but instead of killing him, the guy just... He ties him up and hangs him in a tree like some kind of a human piñata. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. Maybe he likes piñatas. Babe, I'm sorry. Guys, I want that forest cleared, every possible suspect found. I want friggin' bambi in my debrief room before sundown. Chief, what about saul? Peters? What about him? Do you think he's involved in this? We don't have enough information. So go get me more information. What's our next move? Find those bodies. I'm gonna put in a call to the fbi, let 'em know what we're dealing with, or at least what I think we're dealing with. Michael. Yeah? You can be partners at work, or you can be partners at play, not both. All right, guys. We need to get back to the station. Mom! There's something in my closet. They're called clothes, pumpkin. No, something mean. It made a mean noise. That's just my story on the tv. Your stories are all about kissing, but the man in my closet's too angry to kiss. Now it's a man? Definitely not a lady. It's the boogeyman. Fine. Let's go take a look. See? Maybe he went under the bed. Honestly! I can't believe you sometimes. I was just playing dress-up. Aah! Aah! Aah! Are you serious? By skinner's? Uh, I saw cops and an ambulance when I left, but no one said anything about a serial killer. Uh, no, yeah. I'm at home. Yeah, bring your bowl. Jake? You here? Jake? You here? Jacob! Jacob! Jake? Why are you walking around in the dark? Yeah, good point. Hey, uh... What? I'm, you know... You're not sorry. Okay, I'm not. But I shouldn't have to be. Hey. You know, if I try and help you, you say you don't need it. And if I don't, you still bitch. I... I give up, jacob. I don't need your help. I need you to stop telling your friends I take tap lessons. No one was there for me when I was your age. No one painted your bike pink, either. When I was in eighth grade, I got a black eye every day. Why don't you man up and deal with it? Butthead. Jerk. Mike, I owe you an explanation. No, you don't. I know your father is samuel peters. You're in mourning. I get it. I disappeared on you today. I was trying to find out... You know, my mom used to tell me all these stories about how terrible my dad was, and I always thought, well, I must be terrible, too, somehow, on the inside. That's why I transferred back here: To find out, to confront him. And? And until today, I never had the guts. I was scared. Yeah, well, fear... can be a terrible thing. Yeah. But I made a promise. No more fear. Yeah? Yeah. Me, too. Officers samuels and asher, do you copy? We copy. Double time it back here. I'll meet you at your black-and-white. Over. What happened, chief? There's another victim. Don't get too handsy. The fbi are on their way. Gonna want a clean scene. How soon? They're flying a specialized csi team in from d.c. they'll be here by sunup. That soon, huh? Ah. These don't look like knife wounds. Ohh... ucch. Oh. What the... What is that, a claw? Fingernail. Human. Grown out and sharpened. Just like our guy's m.o. bare hands. So what, the... the daughter was here the whole time? No, she didn't see anything. Heard a scream and found the body. Dad's alibi checks out. He's out of town. I'm gonna head back to the station. Start organizing the search. As soon as the coroner gets here, join me. I want this guy found. Word. Anybody there? Jacob? Who's there? This isn't funny! What's your phone doing here? What the f... Who is it? I... Dude, answer it. Hello. What was that? Crank call. Did you check the caller i.d.? It was blank. Go back to sleep, jacob. Well, what's with the gun? Nothing. Go to bed. Isaac! Help! Jacob! Hello. Isaac? Are you okay? It got into the house! I don't know, some kind of a monster. Wait. Just... just... Just calm down. Okay, son? D-did you say monster? He... he tried to hurt jake. I... I tried to stop him, dad. I don't think I could. I shot him. I just... Isaac? Isaac, what the hell was that? Dad, I'm sorry. Tell me what is happening! Dad? Jake, I want you to... I want you to lock all the doors. I'm on my way. The doors were locked, dad. It got in anyway. It was under my bed. Tell isaac that you need to get in the car and go to the station and they'll take care of you there, all right? He says go to the station. Dad, we're gonna go. Meet us there. I'm on my way. Jake, I'm gonna go out first. You stay here until I give you the all clear, okay? Yeah. All right. Can I come out? Not yet. Ohh... ohh... jake! Get down! Get in the car! Now! Aah! Hey, I found my cell. Run! They're not answering. Drive faster. Something is after us. Isaac, is that blood? Forget about it. It killed my friend. Is that your dad's gun? Yeah. You... you have to lock the doors right now. Gimme the gun, son. No, it could be here any second. You're gonna have to give me the gun. No. What the hell is wrong with your face? Now, there's... there's nothing to worry about, all right? You guys are gonna be safe in here. Where's my ketchup? Don't mind our guest. I'm holding on to this till I see my dad. All right. Hey, jacob. Want to grab a soda? He stays with me. Okey-dokey. You guys sit tight. I'll be back in a minute. Don't you worry about a thing. Who else is here? It's just me, but I got... Where's cole? Dispatched to help the manhunt. Bring him back in. Bring 'em all back because I just found the guy we're looking for. Okay, but I got mike's kids in interrogation with a gun. What? That's what I've been trying to tell you. Isaac came in covered with blood, saying something's chasing them. He was right. I need my shotgun. Hey! We need help over here! We need help! It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay? Daniels? It's gonna be okay. Shhh. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. You just calm down. Look! No, don't! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please! Please! No! Ohh! God. Ketchup! I asked for ketchup, they give me ketchup! Ha ha ha! That is just nuts. Ketchup. Wow. More than I need. This is way too much. Gotta get some fries with this ketchup. Oh, god. Really, this is nuts. I... I shot till it was empty, but it didn't work. That thing took him. Let me go! Let me go! I can't let you move, mr. Samuels. He took jacob. Not until the doctor's here. Check his restraints. Can't let you move, mr. Samuels. Your... your wife... Please, mr. Samuels. Not until the doctor... Your... your wife... sir. The accident was severe. There wasn't anything we could do. I'm afraid... No! No! We're gonna find him. We don't even know where to look. We'll look everywhere. We won't leave a d... a dark corner for that thing to hide in. Mike, if he wanted to hurt jacob... Michael. Michael, hey. We'll find him. Okay? Okay. We'll find him. What are we waiting for? Those kids are out there. Listen. Listen up! I'm not gonna waste any time here. We all know what's happened. Wherever our target went, he's got michael's son with him, so we can't go in all guns blazing. Find him, call dispatch, and we'll bring everything we've got. What about the fbi? Not gonna be here in time. This one's on us. I'm gonna take a team back to the forest where we found aaron. The man we're after left him there. Must have planned on coming back for him. It's not a man. Excuse me? Uh... it's not a man. I shot it. I thought I killed it, but he just got right back up. It can't be a man. Of course it's a man. At the other scene, we found a fingernail, a human fingernail. I don't care if it's frigging godzilla! We're gonna take it down. Those of you not on my team, go house-by-house. The perp is fast. Could be anywhere by now, so we have to be faster. Move out. Move out! You know I can't let you. Well, I'm... I'm not sitting around here while he's out there. You can't tell me that you're even-headed right now. Of course I'm not... What your son needs is... Don't tell me what my son needs. ...someone who is calm. He needs his father. I'll bring him back to you, mike, I swear. But you are not coming along. Hello. Uncle franklin. What? You called my father a monster, and I need to know what you meant by that. I don't know what you're talking about. A boy is missing, and I don't have a whole lot to go on here. Whoever killed saul, I need to find him, and I need to stop him. So if you know something... A boy is gonna die if you don't help me. Oh... I doubt that. You're just like my father. If the boy's chosen, I can't help, and neither can you. Hello? Ah, damn it, frank. Let's go! Saul... I really made a mess of things. I guess I owe you. It's my fault he's gone, dad. Don't be stupid, isaac. Remember when I was in eighth grade and I came home from school with a... Yeah, yeah. With a black eye. Sure, I remember. You picked a fight with a group of kids because they were talking about your mother. You yelled at me. Less than a month after she died, those four guys cornered me, said that stuff. You threw the first punch, isaac. I... I think it was right what I did. She couldn't stand up for herself. And you punched a kid in the face. You know, you told me I was stupid then, too. That it didn't matter what people said about her. You need to toughen up, isaac... because it doesn't matter what anyone says. It does, dad. It really does. I'm sorry. I'm here! What do you want? I'm waiting for you! You chose me! I'm abel! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! I can smell you! You might as well show yourself! What the hell was that? Let's go. Jacob! Jacob, you out there? Jacob? Jake! Jacob! Jake! Jake! Jacob! Jacob, where are you, buddy? Aah! Chief! Chief, over here! Oh, my god. Aah! He's fast! 4-2-6! Jake? Uh, dad. Jake, where... Where are you, bud? Are... are you all right? Jake? Did you say jake? Uh, I don't know. Okay, I need... I need you to look around, pal, okay? Tell what you see. Uh, well, I found the barn. There's... there's dead people in it. An old barn. Uh, there's a place by skinner's. Okay. Jake, I'm coming for you, man. Just hold on the line. Aah! Damn it! Where'd he go?! I don't know! Behind you! Chief! Chief! No. We're almost there, jake! Come on, isaac! Uhh! Hey, dad. Dad. Look, give me the knife. Not a chance. You don't understand. Saul. I'm saul's brother! Dad? The barn. Come with us. My god. He didn't waste any time. Who? What the hell does this thing want? What? Dad? Jake? What's wrong? My ankle. Is it... Aah. Okay. It's sprained. We're gonna have to carry you outta here. Okay, buddy? Give me that knife. The knife stays with me. You got a weapon. Give me a chance. Isaac, get your brother. Michael? Rebecca! Michael. Thank god. Are you all right? Uh... what happened here? It was that... that thing. Its so fast. It is. We need the brand. The what? The brand. At saul's house. N-no. No, we need to get in the car and go! No. No. It's on to the boy now. It'll follow you wherever you go, no matter. Saul's place. Let's go. Come on! Watch the door. If it comes, stab him. It'll hurt like hell. Dad, I want to go home. I know, jake. We will. Hey, old man! What's with the knife? Your gun will do nothing. This here blade's made of copper. Copper will burn it to agony. Ah! Rebecca! Here. Take this sword and guard the back door. Why does she get a sword? Franklin, you need to tell us what you know. Nobody will listen to an old man! We're just about ready to believe anything right now. Yes. The brand. The brand is the key to everything! Hey, that's the same mark saul had. Yes, I suppose it is! Franklin. Franklin! Tell us. Saul... your father, he was chosen. Some people are chosen for greatness, for higher things. Not saul. Something terrible caught sight of him, grabbed hold of him, wouldn't let him go. It tore a hole right through his life. Everyone thought he'd thrown away his family, his career. But they were wrong. You were wrong. You were sacrificed. It was a fate worse than death. He had to live for that creature... be its guardian... its warden. Feed it. Feed it? It's insatiable. Addicted to death. An eternal killer. Creature? It was a man, I suppose, a long time ago. Centuries ago, that sword was made for a conquistador in spain. Another cursed soul. He was on his way to the new world, hoping to abandon it in the wilderness. But it was not to be. Even then, the creature was ancient. Holy relics, these weapons. They were passed down with the burden... from one keeper to the next. Keeper of what? A demon cursed eons ago. An evil which will never pass from this earth. Its name... his name... Cain. Cain? "Cain and abel" cain? Adam and eve's kid? In the bible, cain was the first murderer. He shattered his brother's skull with a stone, and god cursed him forever to suffer the guilt for what he'd done. He left a mark to warn others. You can't be serious, man. Even old stories have a kernel of truth, boy. So copper can kill it? No. You can't kill cain, only hurt is all. But copper will do that. Isaac, b-back at home, you shot it with dad's gun, a-and it ran. Copper-jacketed bullets. What does any of this have to do with that brand? Everything. Consumed with guilt, cain wants his brother back. He wants his keeper, his abel. Left to his own devices, he will choose for himself. The brand. The brand marks the keeper. It seals the deal. Jacob. Yes. Cain has chosen his next abel, and he has chosen your son. Guys. If a copper knife hurt this thing... It's gonna love copper bullets. Let's do this. I suppose he will. Might give me time to get this hot enough. To do what? To brand someone. That's what you're planning, isn't it? Who did you have in mind? He's here. Shh-shh-shh. I'm over here, you! Is this what you want?! Aah! Aah! Rebecca! Uhh! I am your master! Aah! No! No! Jacob, jacob! Where are you going? The attic. No! No! No! Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Over there. If we just get you to the car. No. No. It's too late. Hey, old man. Thanks for saving my son. Rebecca. I have to tell you something. What? For years, i-i've been carrying the burden on my own. Cain came to me first. I did something I regretted for the rest of my life. I didn't let cain decide. The mark? You branded your own brother? My father abandoned us because of you. You killed my mother! I was frightened of shouldering the responsibility. I'm so sorry. But... he doesn't choose just anyone. No, dad. You gotta let me go, isaac. There's no other choice. That thing will kill you. Dad, it's gotta be me. Michael. If you take the mark, you will lose your boys like I lost my father. No! Cain wants a brother. No. No, I am not giving you to that thing. You have to. Guys, do you smell smoke? We gotta get out of here. Ready. Let's boogie. Aah! Hey, let's go this way. Aah! Mike! Boys! Out the back. I'll get your father. Wait. Take me! You want a brother? This is what I'm willing to do for mine. Aah! Aah! Dad! Come on, boys! Come on! Dad! Go! Where's rebecca? She ran after you. Okay, isaac, get in the car! Okay, I want you boys to go. Just drive and don't look back. No, dad! Jacob, you'll be fine. Okay, buddy? I got to get rebecca. Go! Come on, damn it! Michael? Michael! Michael! Oh, frack. Cain! Brother. Aah! What? Go, michael. Go. Stop. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Michael. Michael, I never understood why... How my father could leave his entire family. Now you're wondering the same thing. Where did she go? Why did she do it? All right. Let me, uh, let me try that. Let me try. Come on. Give 'em to the old man. Go on, dad. What you got? Okay now. All I can say is... it was about time cain had a sister. Oh, there! Big dog.
