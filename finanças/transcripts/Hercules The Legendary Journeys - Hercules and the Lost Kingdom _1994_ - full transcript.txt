This is the story of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the Earth was still young. The ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they played mankind for their sport, plaguing them with suffering, besieging them with terrors. For centuries, the people had nowhere to turn, no one to look to for help, until... he arrived. He was a man like no other, born of a beautiful mortal woman but fathered by Zeus, king of the gods. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. But everywhere he went, he was tormented by his stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. Hera's eternal obsession was to destroy Hercules, for he was the constant living reminder of Zeus' infidelity. No matter the obstacle, as long as there were people crying for help, there was one man who would never rest: Hercules! HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS Hercules and the Lost Kingdom You came searching for Hercules, but instead you found your death! Hera killed him! It's only us now! We must find Hercules before it's too late! We're almost there! You're the last! It's up to you! There's a giant coming! There's a giant coming! Where is that water I sentcha to get?! I've told you before, you don't work, you don't eat! But it's true! I saw him, he's huge! The ground started to shake... "Oh, so the ground started to shake!" What, like this?! No, like that! It can't be! Shut the door! Here, quickly! Please! Any-Anything you want! I want... Hercules! Hercules? The... There's no Hercules here! What would Hercules be doing in a crumby place like this?! Then I kill everybody! No! Please! I'm Hercules. What can I do for you? You are Hercules?! I didn't come all this way to kill something as small as you! Fine by me. Look, why don't you sit down, have some stew? First, you! Then, stew! Come on, little man. Be careful. You know, this really... isn't necessary. Oh, yes it is. Look! You don't have to do this...! Looks like Hercules has finally met his match. I beg your pardon, sir. I don't think so. What do you know, old man? Oh, I know about these things. Maybe we do have to do this. Now I kill you! Huh?! Here's to Hercules! Slayer of giants! Bravo! Our little village will be famous forever! And to show our appreciation, we're gonna build a shrine... to you, Hercules! No shrine, thanks. I, uh, wouldn't know what to do with one. But you must want something! I mean, all the gods want something! I'm not a god. I-I don't... want anything. I just... wanna finish my meal. Hercules..., look! Are you Hercules?! A hundred of us were sent to find you. Bring him water. You're safe here. Where are the rest? Dead. All dead. Killed by the queen of the gods. She didn't want us to find you. Hera. Hercules..., ya hafta help us. We've been driven from our city..., and all our best warriors killed. We've done nothing wrong..., and still the goddess punishes us. Please, take our side. Help us. What city is this, my friend? The lost city... of Troy. Troy?! Troy! I'll find it. But you can't. It's lost in the mist. Only I can lead you back. Then you will. Now drink... and rest. Hey, wait a minute. - Where do you think you're going? - Oh. - You were great with that giant. - No, forget about the giant. How do I find Troy? Hercules, don't get involved. Involved? Hera killed that messenger in my arms. She does strange things, she's the queen of the gods. And you're supposed to be king. Who says I'm not? Hercules..., if you were only nice to your stepmother... I mean, if you went into one of... her temples and... did a small sacrifice... You've got to be kidding. Then you'll never find Troy. She's vanished it. So you're not gonna help me, again. Oh, how can I explain? I can't. Fine. Thanks, Father. Hey, hey, w-wait a second, wait a second. I probably shouldn't tell you this..., but you must find the one, true compass. It points... directly to Troy. King Omphale had it last. I can't tell you any more. You'll have to find it yourself. Why don't you come with me? Oh, if I were only a thousand years younger... and single... Excuse me. Excuse me, sir? Whose shrine is this? The shrine of the water god. He withholds the rain..., and we have nothing to eat! Well, eat this stuff... before it goes bad. No, no! This is for the water god, in case he gets hungry while waiting. - What's he waiting for? - The virgin. She's going to fall to her death... in honor of him. Sir..., human sacrifices don't work. I'm gonna have to bring her down from there. What are you doing?! Go away! You're interrupting a religious ceremony. Yeah, well, if you're sacrificing yourself to the water god, he's not home. You're wasting your time. See? What'd I tell you? That was close. You almost fell. I was supposed to fall, you idiot! Didn't you ever see a sacrifice? A maiden at the height of her fertility is the only thing that can save the crops! So..., you're a maiden at the height of her fertility... You've spoiled it. It took all morning for the rope to burn through. You've no right to interfere with my destiny with the gods. Take my word for it. The gods don't care about your destiny. And who are you, that you know so much? I'm Hercules. Your parents named you after Hercules? - What a laugh! - I don't have time for this. - I have to get to Troy. - No... You put... Put me down! This is between me and the gods! Would you stop squirming or we'll both fall! What's the matter with you people? She said... her destiny... is to be with the gods. The gods don't care about her or you. My own father's one. I wouldn't trust him with my sister... - if I had a sister. - Which I hope you don't! Which I'm glad I don't! Forget the gods. You can get along without them. If it doesn't rain..., irrigate. I wouldn't stay here if I were you. Hey! If you really are Hercules..., then obviously, I wasn't meant to drown in that mud hole..., which is why you came along. You're part of my destiny, which means... - you're working for me. - Look, kid..., I've already got something important to do. There's a whole city waiting for my help. Unfortunately, it's a lost city, which makes it harder to find. But you must have been sent to help me, whether you know it or not. Look, I've decided, the best thing to do is to travel together. - Is that right? - That's right. Until the gods show me a sign. Well, if you're gonna follow me, you better keep up with me. I can keep up with you. - What's your name? - Deianeira. Well, Deianeira..., when was the last time you ate? I never eat. Food's a luxury I don't have time for. [...] So of course, it was only natural I'd give my life over to public service. See..., my father was this really handsome king... who loved me... more than anything in the world. But then, when his kingdom was threatened..., he sent me away for my own good. I think he made quite a sacrifice, don't you? That's a well-known fairy tale, Deianeira. My mother used to tell it to me. Who told it to you? I told it to myself, all right? You don't think orphans need fairy tales too? Well, sure I do. I mean, we all do. What do you know about it? Your father's a god. Well, he wasn't home much, I can tell you that. Yeah, well... My father... is this really handsome king... who loved me more than anything in the world. Sweet dreams, kid. Who are you? Why do you follow me? If you're protecting me, here I am. I could use protecting. Wait! Who are you talking to? Nobody. I heard you... Don't just stand there. You're blocking the road! Will you get out of my way, you... mountain of meat? No one passes today. I've come to speak to the king. - The king is dead. - The king's dead? - That's right. - I was sent by Zeus himself. I mean, there must be someone I can see. It's very important. Come on. Too bad. You and Zeus are six years late. And no one passes today. Do you know who you're talking to? This is Hercules. You better get out of our way... or he'll crush your skull like a bird egg and make all the goop run out. Please? Well, uh, who's in charge of the kingdom? I have to see him. Our queen sees no one. She appears in public only once a year at the great slave market. Which is today. The slave market? That's outrageous! How'd you like to be a slave? But I guess you already are... slaves to the slave market. Does she belong to you? You could teach her some manners. Oh, she belongs to no one, believe me. Twin half-wits, huh? Mom and Dad must be really proud. Come here! We can get more for her at the market after I cut out her tongue. This will just take a moment. Yeah, I know. Wow. From now on, be quiet. I'll do the talking. I was only trying to help. I don't need your help. You're so ungrateful! You know, you don't ever thank me. All you do is you always tell me what to do. All right, remember what I told you. Let you do the talking. That's right. Greetings. I'm here to see the queen. I was sent by the king of the gods. How'd you get past the brothers? Stop him, brothers! Prepare to die, trespasser! Don't let him get away! I love this. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. How many of you brothers are there? We are the 48 sons of Martinus, guardians of the gate. On the blood of my brothers, now you will die! And now, you will die! Only 42 more to go. Not that way! What? How'd I ever get mixed up with you, anyway? Oh, that's great. Why are we sneaking in?! We were doing great! I have to talk to the queen about a compass, not leave a trail of bodies 48 brothers long. Surely there must be an easier way than this. What did you push me for?! - I didn't push you, you fell. - No, you pushed me. Now, listen. Behave yourself, this is a big city. So keep your mouth shut. Don't tell me what to do. I've been in a big city before. One day only! One day only! Tomatoes, sweet and beautiful. Hey, hey! Try my rabbit. Try it. - Hungry? - Yeah. - How much? - For you, nothing. Tell your friends. Tell them! Tell them! This rabbit tastes funny. That's because it's 'possum. Welcome! Welcome, everyone, to the queen's slave market! For our first item today, we have this attractive... former princess of Thessaly. Still listed as a virgin... and with excellent references up and down the country. She's anxious to find a domestic position, and she can start immediately. Now, what am I bid?! Who can...? How ya gonna get to meet her? I'll think of something. So... you're calling him Hercules, huh? It might work. He is Hercules. Look at him. Ouch. You convinced me, kid. Like to come this way, uh, Hercules? And here we have Hercules, son of Zeus! Available today only, for one day! To clear fields, move heavy objects! Or you name the labor! At ten dinar, who'll open the bidding?! - Twelve! - Fifteen dinars! - A hundred! - Seventy-five! - Eighty! - A hundred! - Two hundred dinars! - Seventy-five! - Two seventy-five! - Three hundred dinars! - Three hundred! - Three fifty! Five hundred dinars! Six hundred dinars! Seven hundred and fifty! - Eight hundred dinars! - A thousand dinars! - Eleven hundred! - Twelve hundred fifty! Sold to Her Highness, Queen Omphale! And may Her Majesty find much pleasure in him! Your Highness. I'll take this to him. As you wish. Thank you, Waylin. Are you comfortable? Too much so. Queen Omphale, I-I... put myself up for sale because it was the only way I could get to see you. I'm on a journey to the lost city of Troy... and Zeus told me your husband had the only compass that could lead me to it. There's plenty of time for that when you've completed your work here. Of course. What is it you want of me? Hercules, the best thing about being queen is that I can make a holiday whenever I want. I've decided no one will work in my kingdom today, so... rest here..., and tomorrow we'll see. Apologies, my queen. You only have me for the day. But I paid for a thousand days. But... But this is way too much for one day's work. If you find any more Hercules' like that, you just bring them to me, okay? - Is someone hitting this door... - ...with a rock? Yeah, me. Where's Hercules?! I need to talk to him! This door is over a thousand years old..., and in five minutes, you've made dents in it. Excuse me, eunuch. I just gave you a message to give to Hercules! Hercules is unavailable for the foreseeable future. And I'm not a eunuch, I'm a slave. What's the difference? Uh... I'll tell ya when you grow up. Lovely kumquats. Two for a dinar. - I hate kumquats. - You don't like a bargain? Gods... You're a funny man, Waylin. - Hey! Watch it! - Excuse me. Welcome, slave. Do I look like a slave? Just give me the menu. - I'll be back, Helena. - I'll have the wild chicken. - And to drink? - She doesn't like slaves. You can be frank here. Even tyrannical, if you want. She's a master? Look, can I get some service or what?! Uh, why don't you come to my table, huh? The wild chicken's gonna take a while. First, you gotta chase 'em, then you gotta catch 'em. These girls work for the government too. - Mm-hmm. - You're all slaves..., - happy slaves... - We have financial security..., steady work and no chance of being fired. You're miserable and you don't even know it. You should be fighting to be free, fighting to the death, probably! Appetizer. Food? When was the last time you ate? We get three squares a day working for the government, - and a roof over our heads. - Mm-hmm. A toast to Queen Omphale. Salud. You call this a chicken?! It's small and tough because it had to make it on its own. No offense. - Oh no, it's Melus. - It's Melus. Ya don't pay your protection money..., how we gonna protect you? Just a moment, you... I'm Princess Deianeira of Thessalonia. And these slaves belong to the royal household. It's just business..., miss. How much do they owe? Ten dinars a week..., three weeks behind. Very sensible..., princess. Don't be smug with me, you arrogant bucket of slop! Very well. And know... that if my men find any impersonators to your royal family, we'll honor you by slitting their throats. Whatever you paid him..., he'll just want double next week. Unless you really are a princess. You slept well, I trust. You must be hungry. I have no right to rest like this. My journey is urgent. Eat something, you need your strength. No, what I need... is the compass that points me to Troy. These are my late husband's navigational instruments. With them, he traversed the world. They can guide you to where you want to go. Take what you want of them. They mean nothing to me. Thank you, Queen Omphale. I know this will take me to Troy. Don't! Hey, listen, I know Hercules is in there. You're squashing my foot! Tell Hercules his friend Deianeira's waiting, and if he doesn't come out soon, she might not be waiting anymore. Princess Sayonara of Thessalonia. Do I have it right? Or is it by any chance "Princess Dead Squirrel Meat"? Kill everything, except her tongue. Bring that to me. I want to watch it flap in the dirt. Get her! - Out of the way! - Hey! - We got her! - That was easy! Hercules?! Hercules. Wait! It's you. You saved me. I must go. But you've been following me since I was a kid. I wanna know why. Hey! I'm talking to you. As you follow your destiny, I follow you. Follow my destiny? What is my destiny? Tell me! Are you ready to travel? Or maybe you need another couple of days in bed. This will get us to Troy. - The queen was very generous. - Hmm. And of course, you couldn't say "no". Let's go, Deianeira. Time's wasting. No... Not so fast! I made plans for lunch. Come on. Ya paid last time, so ya can pay again. I didn't! I couldn't. Excuse me. Is there a problem? Not if ya got thirty dinars..., slave. Why don't you just leave people alone? Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. No!!! Sorry. Hmm. Goodbye, Waylin. Master, every cringing cur in the kingdom owes you obedience. I thank you from the bottom of my servile soul... for saving my life. It's no problem. I enjoyed it. Bye, Waylin. Don't be a slave all your life. I have no choice. Can I try? Sure. Get... back here. This way. How far is this Troy, anyway? Hercules, something's been bothering me. And if you are a god, then you can answer it. What bothers you? I wonder, maybe... I am one. A god? Mm-hmm. - Don't be a god. - It's not up to me. Is it? - Be a girl, and then a woman. - Just a woman? My mother's just a woman, and everyone loves her. Which is why... Hera hates my guts. Look..., I know the gods, and most of them are bums. I mean, they kick people around because they're bored or because... some other god tweaked their nose. They live forever. It makes 'em crazy and mean. What about you? Are you immortal? You wanna know? And so do I. All I can tell you... is when the Sun's out... I'm gonna live forever. Then at night..., when I can't sleep and the worries come creeping in..., well, the next monster's gonna get me for sure. You said somebody's been following you. Yes, since I was a kid. Stay here. Hello! I don't need a slave, Waylin. I appreciate the offer, but it just wouldn't work out. You saved my life back at the bar. I've decided to devote the rest of my time to your service. - Don't you wanna be free? - I can serve as a free man. I don't need a free man, either. I don't think you realize... how truly useful an obsequious person can be. You worm! Haven't you got any self-respect? Look at yourself! Hey, what do you want? I'm a professional slave. It's what I do, and I do it well. You have to admire a man who knows what he's good at. I await your command. All right. Here's my command: return directly to Omphale's kingdom... and serve her for the rest of your life. Is that what you really want? Yes! Then I must obey. You'll never see me again, either of you. But know this, Master. Whomever I serve in the future..., I dedicate my servitude to you. Waylin, would... Thank you. Great. We come all this way, and now your one, true compass is pointing to nowhere. I suppose it's broken now. It's not broken. Well, my destiny doesn't stop here. Somebody's did. Look at this boneyard. Troy must be on the other side of this ocean. How are we going to get across? We don't have a boat. Rise. Rise, blue serpent, and do the work that Hera asks of you. Hercules..., I feel something happening. Who is that? Is that the man who's been following you? It's my protector, Hercules. Some protector... Hercules!!! Did you see that?! It came straight for me! I noticed. I told you my place was with the gods. Deianeira..., I don't think the gods hang out in here. But they accepted me, that's all that matters. I don't know why you're so excited. We're about to be digested. Don't you understand? This is supposed to happen. No. That's what's supposed to happen! It's the wrong way out. This way. Stay here. You hold on! I'll come back for you. Hercules! There's something in here! No!!! Did you kill it?! Did you kill it?! Is it dead?! Is it dead?! It's dead! We've gotta get outta here! Give me your hand! It's Troy, Hercules. - How do you know? - I remember now. It's where I'm from. Why are you stopping now? We're almost there. Something's not right. We could be walking into a trap. Hercules, you still don't believe my whole life's been a journey here. And whatever the gods intend, I will fulfill, - with or without you. - I'm pretty sure it's a trap. Then without you, and fine by me. Of course, uh..., I could be wrong. Will you get me down?! Get me down, Hercules! - Would you...?! - I've already killed you, spy, but for information, to please my king..., - I may loan you back your life. - Kill him, Hercules! We're your prisoners. - We won't resist. - The hell we are! I'll die right here before you keep me from my city! Your city?! The city is ours, and though we may live in the woods now, the people of Troy will one day retake their homes and be exiles no more. Take us to your king. Hercules, you want us to be captured? I bow to no king! You'll bow to the king of Troy, who only knew you landed the instant your foot touched our shore. Up the stairs. - You found her. - As you predicted, my king. - An easy snare. - Hey, what's going on here? Tell me your name, young woman. - Deianeira. - Deianeira. I don't understand. I thought they were spies. Will you leave us, my friends? Are you my father? Yes. Yeah, but... I gotta figure this out. You're a king. The king of what? The king of Troy? So how come you live in the woods? Your words... still spill out. Deianeira, I did a terrible thing... which I've kept hidden... all these years. You were such a beautiful child... that Hera demanded I sacrifice you to her sea monster. I couldn't do it. I sent you away, across the sea. Yes, I... saved you... but Hera was angry. She sent the blue priest to drive us out of the city..., to live in the forest as exiles. And only I... knew why. Because of me. I loved you... too much. I sacrificed all of Troy... for one... tiny girl. No. You sacrificed your own heart to keep me alive. I found my way back, as you knew I would. I will never leave you again. I'm glad I waited. The people need you, my daughter. Lead them well. Father? I have what I want. The rest is yours. Father? Please don't go, Father. Father? The king, my father, is dead. He taught us how to live when we were driven from Troy..., and that the spirit of our people cannot be broken. We must never forget him... and the city that he loved. - This is Hercules. - Hercules?! He can teach us how to fight... and win back our homes. Yes. Let's charge the city right now, Hercules, and see how many each one of us kills before he dies. There must be a better way than a frontal attack. That would be the coward's way. Well, we certainly wouldn't wanna take the coward's way now, would we, Telamon? 'Cause that way, who knows? Some of us might get out of this alive. I think we should go back now. The girl is here. I can feel her presence. She will not escape me this time. - Prepare the sacrificial chamber. - It shall be done. Come out! - Come out, spy! - Ow! Oh. I'm not a spy! Whoa. I'm a slave! Hmm. The people of Troy do not allow slaves. That's all right, I'm used to prejudice. You're comin' with me, come on! - Careful, it's a thin cloth. - Go on! Get a move on. Ooh. Ooh. - Hey, after you. - Straight up the hill. - Oh. - Come on! Ooh, Zeus, it's a nice day. No. Face the target... at a right angle. Don't square off, okay? You wanna grip the bow in the middle. And hold onto it like you have a bird in your hand. Hmm, maybe we should find a... different weapon for you. Use your back more when you draw back, okay? Deianeira, you have to get yourself into a rhythm. You notch..., draw..., aim..., release. That's good. You have steady hands. You can make 'em tremble. Uh, next time..., bend your left elbow a little more. Are you pulling back on that more, using your back? [...] You shoot well. So, why do we need him? He's Hercules. Ow! You know, I work a lot better without a knife in my back! - Just get on over there! - Excuse me, what's your name?! - Just keep moving! - "Just keep moving"? Is that a first name or a last name? "Just keep moving". Waylin?! How did you find us?! Oh, it wasn't easy. I wore the wrong shoes. Waylin..., what are you doing here? Hercules. You know? The more I thought about it, the more I think you're making a big mistake. You need me as a slave, a good slave, a slave who knows how to be obedient, even if it means being a pain in the ass. It... Obedient? I ordered you home and you've disobeyed me. That's a good point. But what I'm trying to tell you, without being obsequious at all..., is that my place is here with you. Yeah. Give me that. Come with me. Can I get something to eat? What do you think, Hercules? Do we stand a chance? I've watched you training. There's nothing wrong with your swords or your bows, but... the enemy has them too. It's difficult to be a warrior. It's not easy... to kill. You have to make yourself hard. I want every fighter to find his own rock and study it. You have weapons for your hands already. Make a rock your weapon within. Because a rock has no mind or heart... or hope or fear. And if you're to succeed in battle, you must rid yourselves of all of that... and be hard. If we have to be... hard like... rocks to... win our city back..., then we'll be rocks. You'll see. Won't we?! Yeah! The people know that you're behind us. It means everything to them, Hercules. Thank you. They still have to fight. They just... don't get the idea of combat. You know, they think too much. They've memorized... how to shoot an arrow, but if you memorized how to walk, you'd never get across a room. Why don't you ever look at me? Huh? Soon I may be dead and... you never look at me. I've changed. Can you see it? Deianeira, beauty's not important. I mean, it's your spirit everybody likes. You don't think I'm beautiful? Well, sure, but that's not what I mean. Would you ever want... to kiss me? I don't think so. How about now? I don't think so. Now? No. Deianeira, wait! I think... you're a born leader. I mean, you're doing a great job. Don't make it worse, Hercules. Quit following me everywhere I go! I'm not. It's a great city, isn't it? Yes, it is. And you plan to attack it? I don't think it's a good idea. Hera likes the... blue cult. Yeah, she would. Can't talk you out of it? No. Troy belongs to these people, not Hera. Why don't you join us? We'd be side-by-side for once, fighting for a good cause. I haven't been in a real war for... years. Still got it in you? What a question. Of course I have, son! Did you see that?! That means that Zeus himself is on our side! That's a nice shot. But are you gonna help us or not? I've got things to do. I'll lead them myself. We'll fight our way in and keep fighting. - No. If... - Good, you're together. We attack at dawn. Dawn? Why don't we attack tonight? Because we attack at dawn. The truth is, I didn't think we could do it before. I thought I'd just be leading our people to certain death. But with the thunderbolt, I know we'll win, because the gods are on our side. There's not gonna be any more thunderbolts. But I saw it. Zeus is your father, he'll help us. Forget about Zeus. Dawn's in a few hours. And the fighting will be bloody, so you better be prepared. I must do something... or they'll all be killed. Priest, where are you? I can't let this happen. Come to me, Deianeira. Fulfill your true destiny. Hera will open her arms to you. Deianeira, it's dawn. Time to go. - She's not here. - What are you doin' here? Where's Deianeira? - I thought she was with you. - That was hours ago. Waylin, have you seen Deianeira? She passed me in the middle of the night, I thought she came back to her hut. I saw her go into the woods toward the city. Hercules, she must have gone. And by the gods, she's... she's gone alone. All right, you stay here. I'm going after her myself. - So am I. - I'm going as well. Me too! Who's game for the attack?! Let's get Deianeira! And take the city back! No. No! There'll be no attack! - I'm going alone! - I'm going and you can't stop me. But you'll both be killed. There must be another way. I refuse to take the coward's way. I'm going, not you. Telamon, just so you know, I don't need you to tell me how there's a... hero's way and a coward's way. Coward's way... You're right. The cowherd's way! - Why... Why didn't I think of it?! - What, now you? Oh no, not "coward's way". "Cowherd's way". I remember, before we left the city, the man who herded the cows didn't like to use the main gate; took too long to get down to the pasture. - They had a shortcut, a tunnel. - That's right! It got 'em to the pasture quicker. We called it the cowherd's way. You mean, there's a tunnel to the city? Yeah. Where exactly is this cowherd's way? Why, it's down in the brush, it's all grown over. Nobody's used it for years. - Show me. - Yeah, come on! Here it is. Remember your training now. Stay alert. Shh. Shh. Quiet. There's nobody here. Well..., what happened? It's-It's a little run down for a big city. It's too quiet, I don't like it so quiet. I like it better when people are talking. - Waylin! - Yes, Master. Stay here. I'm going alone. We came to fight. Look around you. The doors were open, there's nothing to see. You can't fight what you can't see. You're in charge now, Telamon. Keep them here. Hercules worries too much. There's nobody here. I mean, if there were somebody here, they'd come out, wouldn't they? Otherwise, what's to stop us from coming in? I'm Telamon, warrior of Troy! Are these empty walls my only challenge?! Deianeira!!! Telamon, no! Get up, Telamon! Don't quit! Waylin, are you crazy?! Telamon's dead! We'll all be dead without Hercules! Deianeira! Go away, Hercules! You'll spoil everything! Deianeira..., come to me. We don't need Hercules. I've got Hercules in here. Come on, fish face, I'm not afraid of you! Don't be afraid! If ya stand up to them, they don't exist! Wait! I wanna make sure. If I go through with this, my people won't be killed, and they'll get their city back, right? You were always meant to die for Hera. It's what you were born for. But my people... Look, Hera is coming for you. She's all around us. Feel her power. This... is your destiny. Embrace it. But... I-I thought... It doesn't matter what you thought! You know? I'm getting tired of this. She belongs to Hera. It is her destiny. I don't think so. We'll see. No more labors for you, Hercules. I didn't think it would be this easy. No! Stop! If you want me to sacrifice myself to Hera, I will! Good. First I'll kill him, and then I'll kill you! Hera, I offer you this small life. May it give you pleasure. Guess it wasn't so easy after all, was it? Why did you come here?! What did you think you were doing? I thought it was the only way I could save my people. He said it was my destiny. You followed your destiny, and you found it. But it wasn't to sacrifice yourself. It was to follow in your father's footsteps and lead your people. Will you rule them with me? You don't need me. Son..., this isn't what's supposed to happen. What are you talkin' about? I can justify you're saving the city..., but... Hera wants the girl. - Why does she get the girl? - Oh, you expect me to explain Hera? Hera's a goddess. Hercules! Help me! Hercules! Hera! You don't control our destiny! We find it for ourselves! Hercules! No!!! He's gone. She won't hurt him. She doesn't dare. - But I love him. - So do I. But his work is done here, and he has to... move on. I'll never forget Hercules. Don't forget what he told you about the gods. They are jealous and petty. Now... listen. You must follow your own destiny. You are his father, aren't you? You see the... resemblance? No, no, no, no. He... He looks like his mother. She's only mortal, but she's... exquisite. Well, I have to go, and you've got things to do. You're alive. Hercules saved you when I couldn't. You're hurt. It's nothing. The people are waiting for you. The city is truly ours once more. We're home, Deineira. Thank you. You were very brave. Deianeira, did you see us fight? We were superb. Your father would have been proud. Yes, he would have. Princess, I know Hercules ordered us not to attack, but after Telamon got wounded, I ordered myself to attack. And being a good slave, I obeyed without hesitation. - I think I showed them... - Waylin, you're free. And now you can work for the cause of Troy. I appoint you minister of defense. Minister of defense. I like the sound of that. We must build him a shrine! - Yes, a shrine for Hercules! - No shrines. He wouldn't want that. - Hercules' labor is done here. - Yes. I know that wherever he is, he would want us to look to ourselves now..., to believe in ourselves... and always... to remember him. Long live Queen Deianeira! Hercules! Hercules... Well, they said you came this way. You've got to help us. There's a monster..., a fire-breather! - A fire-breather? - A fire... Yeah, and... and we've sacrificed everything we have! Sacrifices don't work. All right, lead me to him. I'll see what I can do.
