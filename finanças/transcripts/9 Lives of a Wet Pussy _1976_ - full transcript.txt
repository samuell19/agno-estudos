Dear gypsy, I woke up very early this morning. David was still asleep and the house was very quiet. I dressed and went to the stables. As you know, I'm having an affair with the new stableboy, David brought back from France. He's so young and beautiful and quiet. When he touches me, I lose my mind. I want to grab at him and pull him to me, to scratch at him. Gypsy, I can't understand anything when we're fucking and god, when he puts it into me, and keeps pushing deeper and deeper. I feel I could come forever. And the hay on my back and him reaching inside me, it's all I can bear not to scream out and wake everyone. And then when he comes, when he comes, oh god, how I love it when he comes and comes. Oh gypsy, you must really learn to love men again. Gypsy, you must really learn to love men again. Learn to love men again. That's pauline. She does nothing but have intercourse all day long. Then she writes me letters about it as if I might be interested. Those are all hers, faithfully written, telling me about her private afternoons and her greasy paramours, bragging about her incest, her lechery and her violence, but I know all that already. You see, she's really just a child. I haven't seen her in a while, but she keeps in close contact. This is her way of saying, I'm there by you. And it's good, very good, but I miss her and sometimes I hate her for not being here when I need her. What can I do? All I have is the letters and the opium to explain why she's away. Dearest pauline, have you ever imagined that your men have had me as they've had you? Have you guessed yet why I know your lovers so well? No. You could never guess, my simple, passionate pauline. My present is your present. But yours is not mine. I share my moments with you, I live my loves with you, but not with your consent, not with your knowledge. But time will come when you will know it and you will want it. But the time is not yet here. Dear gypsy, it began raining again today as we left the house. As usual, David and I weren't talking, but by now it doesn't matter that much to me. He wouldn't tell richio or me where we were going and so we all sat in silence, staring out the windows. Oh, we still make love together when he's not snorting coke with richio or balling his mistresses and boyfriends. He's the only man I've ever had who can fuck and fuck and never lose his hard on and I can come 100 times and he keeps balling as if nothing were happening, but this cool detachment of his which drives me so wild when we're in bed, makes the rest of my life with him unbearable. Which raised the humidity 93%. The wind. Fill it up please. Do you have your key? Oh. Darling, I have to go to the restroom. Sir, you got a restroom here? Yeah, I'll get you a key. Here's the key. Bathroom's in the back. Thank you. I'm laying out three cards, Hungarian fashion, representing pauline's past. The empress, eternal symbol of the female and fertility. The emperor. Symbol of paternity and masculinity. And the devil. Symbol of the domination of matter over spirit, of revolution and incest. But I knew this would read so. I know pauline. She has her grandmother's soul. They even say she has her face. You see, pauline's great grandfather and his two daughters came to America in 1903 from Poland. Pauline's great grandfather was a very strict Christian. He was really overprotective with the two girls. When the old man would go out to work, he would lock them up in the apartment. The only time they could leave the house was under his chaperone. Life was pretty lonely. And the older they got, the more curious they became. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. And the first born said unto the younger, our father is old. There is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth. Come, let us give our father wine to drink. Let us lie with him and preserve offspring for our father. What are you looking at? Nothing. Why don't you help your sister clear the table? Don't just sit there. Don't you think that's enough? No, we have to get him drunk. But sis. What are you saying? You whispering behind my back? No, no. Clean the table. I told you to clean the table? Come and bring me some more wine. Coming. Papa? Papa? He's sound asleep. Yeah, come on. Papa, papa. He's asleep After they got the old man into bed, the two girls knew by instinct what they had to do. Their father was so drunk from all the wine that he would never wake up and so the girls felt free to do with him as they pleased. It wasn't until paulines grandmother had completely satisfied herself that the younger got her chance Until sunup, the girls continued to satisfy themselves without regard for their father. The old man never woke and the whole night remained a secret only between the girls. But the past appears again in the future and strange affairs seem to run in the family. Pauline has a lover, a Nigerian Princess. She came to this country to celebrate her beauty. She was black magic, darkness of soul come to life, a midnight flower. Pauline befriended her immediately. She loved her purity and her virginity, but the evil forces had other things planned, violent things that made both pauline and her lover suffer. It was jealousy and magic that brought it on, but I had nothing to do with it. Lovely mish, I was afraid of that black bitch. She knew pauline had a spiritual tracker and she would have stopped it, but she didn't. Now she doesn't want to. She's forgotten it all. In my own way, I love her just as much as pauline does. I tell her so while she sleeps, only she can't hear it, not with the bad dreams and all. You want some more pear? No thank you. Do you know I still have nightmares from that first time? Not so much as in the beginning, but it still bothers me a little. I know. I could picture myself all over again I had only been here a few weeks and it was late, very late. You know what I'm saying, man? Uh, young lady, uh, young lady, got a minute? Miss firefox, you got a minute? Uh, young lady, miss firefox. Damn girl, you should be glad to speak to me. Young lady, wait a minute. Hold it, you got a minute? Wait a minute, miss firefox, ma'am, you should be glad to say something to me. Get that fucking thing off her, get that fucking thing off her. Shit, get that fucking thing off her, man, get that fucking thing off her. Get down, get down, man. Get that goddamn dress off. Oh shit! Be cool... Be cool... Yeah yeah There used to be times when I'd be so jealous with pauline. I wouldn't accept her letters or answer her calls. She couldn't understand that. Whey should she? She's never known a jealous moment in her life. You see, being her lover today would never mean you will be her lover tomorrow. It's as if she didn't have a memory. Only the one in her arms is the one she desires and because of this, our love was impossible. I wanted to own her and she couldn't be owned. Gypsy, last night I had a dream about you. We were in bed, making love. We'd been fucking for what seemed like hours and I was on the verge of an orgasm. I opened my eyes to look at you and then the strangest thing happened, you became a man. It wasn't like it used to be. You weren't worried anymore about who I'd been with the night before or where I was going to go later on. You didn't ask me to stop seeing ocalo or to give up the stableboy. You just took me and we fucked without saying a word. Then I came. I asked you to stop and you laughed. We kept going on and on, and we were so beautiful with the moonlight on our back. You were kneeling above me, driving your body into mine. You pressed so closely I could feel the blood rushing through your veins and I kept wishing over and over that it would never stop, that the first time you knew what I wanted and you didn't let anyone come between us. It was just me and you. I gave myself to you and you took me and kissed me and kissed me and kissed me and kissed me and kissed me and kissed me. Then you started to bite and your teeth kept sinking into me. The pain was so beautiful, I wanted you to keep biting, to keep biting. Oh gypsy, it felt so good, oh so good. I tried to fight the desire. I tried to acknowledge its sinister nature, but without coercion, she never would have returned. Now I must succumb to it. She must succumb to it. There's no need for these anymore. Goodnight, sweet. The universe needs Patience. False unity is no unity. There is no reality except human reality. Sister, I've been waiting. It's been lonely and dark for me here since you left.
