Let me get you some water. No. Can't baby feet. No. Can't baby feet. They's got a whole lot more tramplin' to do. You ain't leavin' right away. You stay awhile. Ah, well, long enough to see baby suggs... And you. Where is she? Dead. Oh, no. When? Eight years ago now. When? Eight years ago now. Almost nine. Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard. Soft as cream. Bein' alive was the hard part. Sorry you missed her, though. Is that what you came by for? That's some of what I came for. Rest is you. Truth be known, Truth be known, these days I go anywhere they let me sit down. I wouldn't have to ask you about hi m, would I? You'd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn't you? I'd tell you. You know I would. So you don't know nothin' either. Halle, Halle. Halle, Halle. We got spare rooms. Could stay the night if you had the mind to. You don't sound too steady in the offer. Oh, it's truly meant. It's just that I hope you'll pardon my house. It's just that I hope you'll pardon my house. "My house." I like the sound of that. Come on in. Come on in. Good god, girl. What kind of evil you got in there? It ain't evil. Just sad. Come on. Step on through. I-I thought you said she died soft. That's not baby suggs. Who then? My daughter. Who then? My daughter. The one I sent ahead with the boys before I run off. She didn't live? No. Boys too? No, they alive, I pray. They run off just before baby suggs went and died. Probably best. Ahh! Negro boy got legs, he ought to use 'em. Sit around too long, somebody'll figure out a way to tie 'em up. Ahh! Ahh! By yourself, then? No. Got the girl I was carryin' when I left sweet home. You had that baby, did you? Damn, I didn't think you'd make it. Runnin' off pregnant, all by yourself too. Denver! Come here, baby. I want you to meet somebody. I want you to meet somebody. Paul d, this here is my Denver. Uh, mornin', miss Denver. It's a pleasure. Mornin', Mr. d. Uh, garner, baby. Paul d garner. Yes, sir. Glad to get a look at you. Yes, sir. Glad to get a look at you. She a fine-lookin' young lady, sethe. Yeah. Got her daddy's sweet face. You know my daddy? Of course he know your daddy. He from sweet home. Yeah. Sweet home. How come everybody who run off from sweet home can't stop talkin' about it? It looks like if it was so sweet, you wouldn't run away. Girl, who you think you talkin' to? Girl, who you think you talkin' to? True, true. She-she right, sethe. It wasn't sweet, and it sure wasn't home. But it's where we were, all together. Come back whether we wanted to or not. We have a ghost here, you know? We met. Denver, heat up that stove. Can't have a friend stop by and don't feed him. Can't have a friend stop by and don't feed him. Oh, don't go to no trouble on my account. Bread ain't no trouble. The rest I bring back from where I work. Least I can do workin' dawn to noon is bring home supper. Got any objections to pike? If he don't object to me, I don't object to him. Why don't you spend the night, Mr. garner? That way, two of you can talk about sweet home all night long. Denver, what is the matter with you? Denver, what is the matter with you? I never known you to behave this way. Mama, I can't no more. I can't no more. You can't what? What can't you? Can't live here. I don't know where I'm gonna go or what I'm gonna do, but I can't stay here! Nobody speaks to us, nobody comes by, nobody even knows I'm alive. Oh, Denver. Come here, baby. It's all right. Sethe. I'm a grown man... With nothin' new left to see or do, but I tell you it can't be easy, a young girl livin' in a haunted place. Maybe you ought to move. No. No. No movin'. No leavin'. It's all right the way it is. It's all right. You wanna tell me it's all right, sethe, and that child's half outta her mind. Hush, I say! I got a tree on my back... And a haint in my house... And nothin' in between but the daughter I'm holdin' in my arms. No leavin'. No runnin' from nothin'. No leavin'. No runnin' from nothin'. You hear me? I will never run from another thing on this earth. Come on. You can sit down and eat, or you can leave us be. Lord. What tree, sethe? What tree, sethe? Huh? I don't see nothin' growin' on your back. It's there all the same. Chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That was 18 years ago. - Happened that night. - That night? Tree could have cherries by now for all I know. Tree could have cherries by now for all I know. I ain't followin' you, sethe. I had milk, Paul d. I had milk, see? I was pregnant with Denver, but I hadn't stopped nursin' my baby girl... Before I sent her and the boys off. All I knew was, I had to get milk to my baby girl. I thought we was talkin' about a tree. I thought we was talkin' about a tree. We was all supposed to meet in the cornfield. None of you came. I had to leave my children, go back lookin' for Halle. That's when I saw you in the shed. Sixo dead. Schoolteacher done gone and burnt him. Paul a too. They hang him from a tree. Said you were gonna run no matter what. I didn't think you would make it to the gate. - I went back in the barn to look for Halle. - Animal. That's when schoolteacher saw me. What's it taste like? What's it taste like? Came in there with his boys after me. You've got animal characteristics. Them boys took my milk. That's my baby's food! That's what they come in there for. Hold me down, take it. I told miss garner on 'em. They're lyin', the animals! She had that lump on her neck and couldn't speak. She had that lump on her neck and couldn't speak. But her eyes rolled out tears, I remember. Them boys found out I told on 'em. You're horrible and beaten up! You're horrible and beaten up! Schoolteacher had one of 'em whoopin' up my back. And when they closed, it left a tree. They used cowhide on you. And they took my milk. They beat you and you was pregnant? And they took my milk. Oh, lord, girl. Goddamn it! Hush up! Denver! Denver! Move! Move! Get outta the way! Leave this place alone! Leave this place alone! I said, hush up, goddamn it! Paul d, look out! Paul d! - Paul d! - You wanna fight? Then come on, goddamn it! Then come on, goddamn it!

By the time I woke up mornings, she was in line. Hmm. If the moon was bright, they worked by its light. Sundays, she slept like a stick. Tell me about her. I remember, once, she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse. Only thing I do remember, in fact. She opened up her dress, and right on her rib... Right here... Was a circle... Was a circle... And a cross burnt right in the skin. She points at this mark, and she says... She says to me, "this is your ma'am. I'm the only one got this mark now. "The rest all dead. "Somethin' happen to me, you can't tell me by my face, you know me by this mark." Scared me so I couldn't think of nothin' to say, so I says, "yes, ma'am. "But how you know me? Mark the mark on me. "But how you know me? Mark the mark on me. Mark me too." Did she? No. She slapped my face. I didn't understand it then. Not till I had a mark of my own. What happened to her? What happened to her?

Hope this pudding's good tonight. Denver, pass me your plate down here. Paul d. Where you been all them years... Since sweet home, Mr. Paul? Ain't you got no people? You wanna know about me now. Uh-huh. I got no people. Eighteen years since I left sweet home, and I've been walkin' the whole time. Move, walk, run, hide, sometimes steal and move on. Only time I stayed in one spot for more than a month or so... Was with a Weaver woman in Wilmington, Delaware. Meanest place for a negro I ever seen... Outside of pulaski county, Kentucky. I seen negroes so stunned and hungry, I seen negroes so stunned and hungry, they lived in caves, fought owls for food. Seen some who slept in trees in the day... And moved only by night, who buried themselves in slop to hide from... Posses and lawmen and regulators. Met a negro boy once... About 14... Who lived by hisself in the woods... And said he could never remember livin' anywhere else. Seen a witless colored woman hang... For stealing ducks she believed was her own babies. For stealing ducks she believed was her own babies. In all these years, girl, you beat all. I ain't never seen a negro like you. I think it's time you tell us a little somethin' about yourself. She don't remember nothin'. Oh, you'd be surprised what you start rememberin' soon as you start talkin'. Ain't you got no brothers or sisters? Ain't you got no brothers or sisters? I ain't got nobody. Paul d, stop it. Denver, help me clean up this table. I wanna know, sethe. What you lookin' for when you come here, beloved? This place. This place. I look for this place I could be in. Somebody tell you about this place? She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me. How you come? Who brung ya? I walk here. I walk here. It's a long, long, long, long way. Nobody bring me. You wearin' new shoes, gal. - If you walked so long, how come your shoes don't show it? - Paul d. Stop pickin' on her. I wanna know! Where you get them shoes and the dress you had on? I take the shoes, and I take the dress! The shoestrings don't fit. The shoestrings don't fit. I'll teach you how to tie your shoes. Beloved. Beloved! Beloved. Beloved, beloved, you all right? Let it out. Go to sleep now. You can come in my room. I can take care of you up there. I can take care of you up there. What's the matter with you? What is it about her vex you so? I don't understand what the hold is. It's clear why she hold on to you. I just can't see why you holdin' on to her. What you care who holdin' on to who? She nice girl, company for Denver. There's something funny about that gal. Act sick, sound sick, but she don't look sick. Act sick, sound sick, but she don't look sick. Eats sweets all day long, as strong as a bull. She not strong. She can't hardly even walk without holdin' on to somethin'. Can't walk, but I seen her pick up the rocker with one hand. You ain't seen no such a-thing. Hey, don't tell me. Ask Denver. She right there with her. Sethe, sethe, baby. We were startin' to feel a little like a family ourself till she come along. Is that what got your teeth on edge? It's a feelin' in me. Is that what got your teeth on edge? It's a feelin' in me. I can't place it. It's her. You wanna feel somethin'? Feel what it feel like to be a colored woman roamin' the roads. And anything god made liable to jump on you. Feel that! I know every bit of that, sethe. I wasn't born yesterday, and I never mistreated a woman in my life. Well, that makes one of you in this world. One. Not two? No, not two. What'd Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by you. Halle ran off. He left me, and he left our children. You don't know that. Who he leave then if he didn't leave me? He wasn't there. He wasn't where he said he was gonna be. I had to pack my babies off ahead of me on their own. Stayed behind to look for him. Got caught by schoolteacher and his boys for my trouble. He couldn't get out the... loft, I expect. Loft? What loft? One in the barn, I reckon. He was there? How do you know? Mornin' after you run, I seen Halle... Mornin' after you run, I seen Halle... Chained to a post. I said, "what happened? Where you been?" "The loft, the loft. The loft." That's all he said. Could never figure out what he meant by that. He saw them boys do that to me? And he let them keep on breathin'? And he let them keep on breathin'? I-I ask him, "how come you didn't run with sethe?" He never answered me. I seen him once more, the day schoolteacher sold me to brandywine. Takin' me away in the wagon. There Halle was, in the yard, sittin' by the churn. They didn't need to put no chains on him no more. His mind was gone. Sethe, a man ain't a goddamn ax, choppin' and hackin', bustin' every minute of the day. Things get to him. Things he can't chop down 'cause they inside. Halle never just run off and leave you, sethe. Halle never just run off and leave you, sethe. You see, you the only one of us who made it out that night. The only one. I didn't plan on telling you all that. I'm sorry. I didn't plan on hearin' it. Didn't plan on you walkin' down that road neither, comin' into my house, bringin' all this with you. Where'd you learn to dance? Nowhere! Watch me do this. Ohh! Now you! Come on! You may as well. Just go on! Why you call yourself beloved? In the dark, my name beloved. What's it like where you was before? Can you tell me? Dark. I was small in that place... Like this here. Like this here. Were you cold? Hot! Nothing to breathe down there. No room to move. You see anybody? It's a lot of people... Down there. Some is dead. You see Jesus? Baby suggs? You see Jesus? Baby suggs? I don't know. I don't know the names. Well, what you come back here for? To see her face. Mama's? Sethe's? Sethe. I remember! I remember! I remember! I was in the water. I see her diamonds down there. Then she left me behind... By myself. Don't. You won't ever leave us, will ya? No. Never. This is where I am! Don't tell. Please don't let mama know who you are. You hear me? Don't tell me what to do! Don't you never, never tell me what to do! - But I'm on your side! - She the one! She the one I need! You can go! She the one I have to have! You can go! She the one I have to have! Tell me how sethe... Make you in the boat. Tell me. She never told me all of it. Tell me. Denver. Tell me. Well... Mama was runnin'! Who in there? Who that back there? My, my, my. My, my, my. My, my, my, my! It's a nigger! If that don't beat all! Girl, you about the scariest-lookin' somethin' I ever saw. What you doin' way back up here? I'm runnin'. These the feet you runnin' on?

I expect this baby there is gonna die in these wild onions. I gotta eat me somethin'. W-w-where-where was you on your way to-to, miss? Boston. Get me some velvet. It's a store called Wilson's. They just have the "purtiest" velvet. You ever seen velvet or touched it? I-if... if I did, I didn't know it. Velvet I seen was brown, velvet I seen was brown, but in Boston, they got all colors. What they call you? L-lu. Well, what you gonna do, lu? You just gonna lay here and foal? I... I-i can't get up. I-i can't move. Oh, sure, you can, lu. Come on. You stay here, the snakes might get ya. I can't. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on! I was fishin' off the beaver once when a nigger floated right by me. I don't like drowned people much. Do you? Your feet kinda reminded me of him. All swoll-like. Now this is gonna hurt a little. Anything dead comin' back to life hurts. You ain't got no business pokin' 'round these hills, miss. You ain't got no business pokin' 'round these hills, miss. Lookit here who's talkin'. Ain't nobody after me, but I know somebody after you, and they catch you, they're gonna cut your head off. Stop wiggling, girl. My back hurt me. Your back? Yeah. Girl, you a mess. Turn over here and let me see. Come here. Jesus! It's a tree, lu. Your back got a whole tree on it. Chokecherry tree in bloom. See? Here's the trunk. It's spread and split wide open, full of sap and branches. And darned if these ain't blossoms. And darned if these ain't blossoms. Come on, girl. 'Cause of me, you're up and walkin'. See, Jesus. Lu made it through. I'm good with sick things, ain't I? Yeah, you good. What's all over your dress, girl? It's milk. Gotta get milk to my baby girl. You mean, you got another baby waitin' for you? Oh, my, Jesus. Come on. Come on. Come on. Now... That's Ohio. Jesus lookin' at you, girl! Whoo! Come on. Oh, here's your paddle! What you doin' now, poor girl? Stop that right now! Jesus, lu! Stop it! Stop it! Jesus, lu! Stop it! Stop it! Lu! Lu! Stop it! Oh, Jesus! I'm awfully sorry about braggin'. I need you here now! Don't be gettin' lost on me now, Jesus! Come on! Push! Push! Push! Oh, here comes the head. Oh, dear Jesus, please, help! God, it's stuck! Come on! Come on! Oh, praise Jesus. Praise Jesus. She ain't never gonna know who I am. You better tell her who brung her into this world. You say, "miss Amy Denver... Of Boston." Mm. Pretty. That's pretty. Denver. Real pretty. Shh. So Amy Denver, she left me and mama on the riverbank. That was the first time we met stamp paid. Hey there. You headin' across? Yes, sir. Anybody know you comin'? Yes, sir. My mother-in-law, baby suggs. Most folk call her baby suggs holy. Most folk call her baby suggs holy. To me, she were grandma baby. Thank you, Ella. Thank you, stamp. Oh! Oh, my lord. My sweet Jesus! Thank you! Where's my Halle? Well, he w-wasn't there... Where he said to meet him, and I had to go. Had to. H-h-he'll make it. If I made it, Halle sure can. Where-where's my children? Oh, no, not now. We got to fix you up first. You too ugly-lookin' to wake 'em. Shh. - Buglar, Howard! - Mama, mama! Oh, look at you. Let me see. Oh! Tell me the other baby. Tell me you big sister. Mm, baby suggs call her... Crawlin' already baby. Crawlin' already baby. Crawlin' already? Ain't this somethin'? All right, baby girl. Right this way. Mama's waitin'. All right, Howard, buglar. You're okay. Yeah. Ain't nothin' here worth savin'. What is this? What is this? Weddin' present from Mrs. garner. I wish there was a groom to go with it. Put 'em on, child. Maybe they'll light his way. Look at those shine. Pretty, huh? Daddy come soon, huh? No matter what happen, god has led you home. So... Lay 'em down, sethe. Sword and shield. Study war no more. Study war no more. God has led you home. Where we goin', mama? We goin' to pay tribute to your daddy. Our house used to be a whole different thing. Strangers rested there. People leavin' messages. Folks comin' and goin' all the time. It was a happy house when I first got there with Denver strapped to my chest... Waitin' on her daddy to come. Waitin' on her daddy to come. Daddy. Halle bought baby suggs' freedom, but slavery done already busted her legs... And busted her back, hands, everything. When she come here, she ain't had nothin' left to make no livin' with... Besides her heart. Baby suggs used to preach right here. Let the children come. Let the children come. Let your mothers hear you laugh. Let the grown men come. Let your wives and your children... See you dance. Women! Women! I want you to weep! Just weep... For the living, for the living, for the dead. Weep. Grandma baby used to say your daddy was too good for this world. Remember?

You knew baby? Oh, yeah. Baby suggs holy. God rest her soul. Yeah. Sethe told me she died soft as cream. Yeah. Sethe told me she died soft as cream. Well, maybe on the outside. Why is that? It was me who had brung sethe across the river when she run away from sweet home. I was there the day it happened. Who is it? That there's a picture of sethe. Sethe? That ain't her mouth. I can see why you may think it, around the eyes. B-but that there ain't her mouth. Besides, why would they put some colored woman's picture in the paper? You don't read, do you, son? You want me to read to you? Already fed the girls. You eat? Want something? Best you come inside. I don't have to tell you about sweet home, what it was. Maybe you don't know what it was like for me to get away from there. I did it. I got us all out. Up until then, it was the only thing I ever did on my own. Me... usin' my own head. But it was more than that. I was... I was big... And wide, Paul. So wide, when I stretched out my arms, all my children could get in between. Looked like I... looked like I loved 'em more after we got here. Maybe I just knew that long as we was in Kentucky with schoolteacher, they really wasn't mine to love. They really wasn't mine to love. Look like when I jumped off that wagon, wasn't nobody in this world I couldn't love if I want to. Twenty-eight days. Twenty-eight good days of free life. I'd wake up in the morning and... Decide for myself what to do with the day. Sometimes I... I hear my boys... Hear 'em laughin' a laugh I ain't never heard. Hear 'em laughin' a laugh I ain't never heard. First I get scared, scared somebody might hear 'em... And get mad. Then I remembered that if they laughed that hard till it hurt, that'd be the only hurt they have all day. And when the people would gather... They'd come from all around to hear baby suggs holy... I seen and heard things I ain't never seen before. I seen and heard things I ain't never seen before. I seen what free negroes look like for the first time. Here in this place, we are flesh. Flesh that weeps... Laughs... Dances barefoot in the grass. Love your flesh. Love it hard. Love it hard. Yonder... They do not love our flesh. Amen. Oh, my people... They do not love your hands. Those... They only use... Tie... bind... Tie... bind... Chop off... And leave empty. Love your hands. Raise them up... And kiss them. Twenty-eight days of... freedom. On the 29th day, it was over. Outside. There's a look that white folks get. Righteous look that's like a flag goin' up a pole. A righteousness that... Comes along with the whip and the fist, the burnin', the lie. Long before it happens in the open. No, no! No, no! Howard, buglar, get in the shed! Get in the shed! Run! No! Get in the shed! No! No! No! No! No! No, no, no! - No, no, no! - -Mama! Mama! Sethe!

I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. Your love is too thick, sethe. Love is or it isn't, Paul d. Thin love ain't no love at all. I stopped him. I put my babies where'd they be safe. I put my babies where'd they be safe. Didn't work, though, did it? Your boys are gone, you don't know where. One girl's dead. The other can't get further than the yard. How did it work? They ain't at sweet home. Schoolteacher ain't got 'em. Maybe there's worse. It ain't my job to know what's worse, Paul d. Maybe there's worse. It ain't my job to know what's worse, Paul d. It's my job to know what is and keep my children away from it, 'cause I'd rather know... They at peace in heaven than live in a hell here on earth, so help me, Jesus. What you did was wrong, sethe. I should've gone back there? Took my babies back to sweet home? There could've been a way. Some other way. What way, Paul d? You got two feet, sethe, not four. You can set aside supper for me. I might be late gettin' back. After all I just told you, Paul d, and after you tellin' me how many feet I got, you think sayin' good-bye is gonna break me into pieces? You think sayin' good-bye is gonna break me into pieces? You're a sweet man. So long, Paul d. We could roast some taters. Too late. Tomorrow. I made that song up. I made it up and sang it to my children. Nobody knows that song but... Me and my children. I know. You came back to me. Yeah. Ohh. Back stiff? Mmm. Yeah. Sleeping on the floor's supposed to be good for you. Hurt like the devil. Sleeping on the floor's supposed to be good for you. Hurt like the devil. Should I wake her? No. Let her rest. She likes to see you off in the morning. I'm gonna let her, but first get me that ham out of there. I'm gonna make us a nice, big breakfast against the cold outside. Won't you be late for work? First time I'll be late in 16 years. It don't matter. Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showin' up on time. The world is right here in this room. Right here is all that is and all there needs to be. Right here is all that is and all there needs to be. She ain't even mad at me. Not a bit. Whoo. - Mama! - Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Put it back in there. Put it back. That's it. You're late. You're fired. That's all. I-i... I've had it. That's all. I-i... I've had it. You make potato salad always too sweet. And you didn't make the pies today. You take home too much food. Where are you going? Where are you going? My goodness. Is that... yes, it is. Did you see that? What? That's a disgrace. Sethe. Don't look now, but there is sethe. Mm. Is she the one?
