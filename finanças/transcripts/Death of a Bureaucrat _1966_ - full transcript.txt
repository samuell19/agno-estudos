One also exemplary. As I said, this is something deep roots in history as we know, from the time Egyptians, hundreds of years ago, was customary to bury the dead with objects used in life ... so that his soul also used. In this case, the reason is symbolic, devoid of religious connotation but still, the fact remains the same and ... and I would say yes, which is practically the same. So doctor, is hopeless? Yes, but, as you can not get a duplicate ... because only the person can do ... will be necessary to exhume the body. Say what?
