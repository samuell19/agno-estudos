Set yourself free. Why are you here? Go back to where you belong! I am calling about the ad for the house, over at Esteban Vaca Calderón St. I'm not the one interested.

What were you afraid of when you were a little? I was afraid of many things. Aren't you? We had a huge farm. At least it seemed huge to me. At night when the kids played in the forest. I stayed inside. I was afraid of the dark. when I was little. And the woods too. The woods and the dark? Among other things. Do they go away when you get older? Those fears? Yes, but others take their place. Like which ones? Like... Fear of you not listening to me. Fear of you misbehaving and hitting your brother, To tell you the truth I'm also scared of many things. But what's important is not to let those fears win, Don't let them paralyze you. So, then they must be forgotten? You have to learn to live with them. Isn't it better to forget them? If it's possible, yes. But sometimes you can't forget. When are you going to tell Nona? I don't know what to tell her sweetheart. We can practice. Do you want to help me? Will you play Nona?

Tell me, hun. Tell me, hun. What do I say now? Tell her about dad. How? The earth and all that exists on it... is a manifestation of the natural order. The south is where you plan. what you are going to do. The east is where the sun comes up, and where thoughts are born. The west is our life. It’s where we carry out what we think and plan. Hello. The north is where we see the results... to know if we are on the right path. Thank you, my dog brother. Why did you send us food? If I'd knew it bothered you, I woud have stopped. I just wanted to help. But why? Was it out of guilt? You knew Julian was looking for your husband. Tell me. Or where you the one meeting with him? You're hiding something. Tell me now! What's wrong with you? I'm not going to talk with you about it. You can meet Luis, once you’re calm. I am not here to fight. You missed one turn! Should I take this? Let me help you. Did you choose this one? Yes. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I chose everything else. Thank you. You're going to give her a ring.

Where are your manners? Calm down. Sorry... Don't worry about it. - I hope to see you soon. - Me too! It's always one of you. -Mom! -Stop it! Go away. Stop hitting me. You first! You are such a baby. You too! Come on! What is the matter with you? Why are you misbehaving? Aren't you embarrassed? Your dad and I taught you better! Dad is better than you! Shut up! Don't speak to me like that! Your father is gone. And he's not coming back. Let's get a cab. I hadn't seen mom happy in a long time. Idiot! You're the idiot. You always return to the same places... where you loved life.

It will do you good. I'm fine. I want another whiskey. Thanks for coming. Don't worry about it. Did I wake you up? Any 3 a.m. call is bound to wake us up. You are a piece of work. I was a really bad friend to Elena. Did she complained? With you? This problem with the food and the kids. What are you doing here? I'm here because... I went to the schoolyear party. And then? I felt the need to go out, think and see people. Listen... Julian was tired... Of this... Julian wanted legal advice. He was worried about the kids. He was trying to keep things friendly. Elena has known for some time now. It wasn’t easy for him. I mean it. Today, I got up on stage and I sang. I didn´t do it wrong. I didn´t do it wrong. Do you know that song about time and things? Time... - Time? - It eats up everything. The wind we breathe is what that keeps us alive. When it stops, we die. We can see traces of the wind in our fingertips. There, the swirls show how the wind blows with us. Can you do this? Ana? What? I can't wake her up. She finished all her pills. Mom. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Mom. Carmen. What? Daniel thought you were dead. You took all your pills. Is that what you want? To leave us alone? Dad is dead. Don't you realize? You're not the only one in pain. Everything is okay. Are you sure? Hi mom. Yes, I know. Yes. Sorry, I couldn't. I need to tell you something. No. It's about Julian. He's not okay. He had a heart attack a few months ago. No. No, it’s just that... He didn't make it. We are ghosts. We don't have parents or children. That's sad. And we have to haunt people so they can... Dance twist. Twist, twist, twist. Forgive me. What are you doing? What are we doing with all his clothes? We’re giving them to people who need them. It looks good on you. You want it? Yes. Ok then, keep it. Hold this. Help me. This goes to the shirt box.
