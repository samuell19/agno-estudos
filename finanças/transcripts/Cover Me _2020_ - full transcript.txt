(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Years ago, I was scheduled to go on a vacation. First one I was going on since my dad passed. I was reluctant to go because my business needed my attention. But I agreed to go because my family demanded it. (SIGHING) But I wasn't prepared for what was to happen just before we left. (CHILL DRUM AND BASS MUSIC) MIA VOICEOVER: Today, I'm scheduled to go on vacation. The first one I'm taking since my dad passed. I'm reluctant to go because Stoneware App Development needs my attention. Stoneware used to be my father's company. It will always belong to him. But now ownership is split between my mother, myself, Back off. MIA VOICEOVER: And Richie Howell. You do realize you just broke into my property, don't you? Do I have the right to defend myself? I trusted you. Don't you see I'm trying to save this place? I mean you wanna keep your precious little Ma and Pa? Wake up and smell the coffee, Mia. You either sell now or you dry up and vanish into oblivion! But not me, no. No I'm thinking of the future. And you're not a part of it. (GUN FIRING) MIA VOICEOVER: But I could have never prepared for what happened just before we left. (LIGHT MUSIC) I don't know why I try to go back to sleep. I think I inherited restlessness from my father. When I was a kid, he woke up before the sun came up and left before we ever even saw him. (LIGHT ROCK MUSIC) (CLACKING) He rarely stopped to take a vacation. Even when he did, he brought his work with him. I started working for him right out of college. That's what happens when you switch your major three times and graduate with a degree in communications. But it was probably the closest we'd ever been. I finally had a relationship with him, kind of like an ongoing take your child to work day. He taught me a lot. He taught me that a great company is built on loyalty. That's not some insincere, overused company motto. My father knew loyal people are the real treasure. He would buy coffee for his employees every morning. Whatever they wanted from Marie Catrib's Cafe, they got. He'd even buy me my fave, double skim latte with two pumps of sugar-free caramel. He never forgot, and neither did I. Miss Mia. Oh ho, thank ya. Oh you never forget. Here you go. Don't you drink my coffee, Mo. MO: Yeah right. Where's my coffee, huh? Oh Richie, I could have sworn I heard my six year old daughter. How much money have you wasted on those people, seriously? You get to misappropriate funds, and so do I. Coffee and liquor are two different expenses. Hey, I handle the expenses here, partner. Last day. Last day? Before your vacation. Oh, right. Wow, glad I reminded you. I spent a lot on those reservations. Yeah, thanks. You haven't reminded me enough. Apparently not. I got that. MIA: Did you have Benny wrap up that Park contract? It's in my office. What? MIA: Mhmm. Thanks, Mia, good morning. Good morning. MIA VOICEOVER: Welcome to Stoneware. Chris Park wants to move the app meeting up to 10:30. 10:30? What time is it? 8:04. Shoot. MIA VOICEOVER: It's crazy here. Can you make sure that projector's working? It kept stalling the other day. Do you want coffee? Drank some already today. So, yes. You can have mine. MIA VOICEOVER: The truth is, Louisa's always been the company's heartbeat. So every benefit is represented by eye-catching imagery so that the consumer... Here it is. It's ready. Once you sign it. Mia, it's not an Apple Conference. It's a small deal, just keep it personal. Thank you, I think I know how to give a presentation. RICHIE: Not a doubt in my mind. Every benefit is captured by eye-catching imagery. Like this one right here for example. So your app doesn't bog people down with information. It shows more when they wanna know more. Yeah, yeah. I can see it, but, I don't know. I mean when we met with Meta, they gave us a great option to track customer satisfaction. Do you have anything like that? MIA VOICEOVER: So much for my degree in communications. We need to think about it. Customer satisfaction? Customer satisfaction, I mean you know, you have that. So does everybody else. Why do you think people deck themselves out in Nike head to toe? Customer satisfaction? This layout is about loyalty to the values of Park Insurance. It doesn't just sign people up, it keeps them signed up because they wanna feel like they're a part of something. Customer satisfaction, that's worthless. Customer loyalty, that's priceless. (LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC) Sounds great. Thank you. I think you're gonna like it. I agree. Thank you very much. MIA VOICEOVER: Like I said, Stoneware's heartbeat. You have an updated contract? You'll have it first thing tomorrow. Seriously? CHRIS: Okay, sure. All right. Hey, keep up the good work. Of course. Take care. What was that about? What? First thing in the morning? You have the contract signed and ready. No, no, no, no, look. We gotta punch it up. He said he was talking to Meta. What, he said yes, as in yes I wanna sign the contract. Wait. You don't have the updated contract, do you? You didn't get it back from Benny because you were late! No, no, no, look, it's not like that. - I got this. - Show it to me. Show it to me then. All right, fine, okay? Just cut me some slack here. In five years, when have I lost a client? Am I not reliable? Tell me I'm not reliable. You're not reliable. I got them in the room! I've locked down three new clients this quarter. And I got you and your hubby those tickets. Remember? You are something else. MIA VOICEOVER: My father's legacy lives another day. I think. What's it like being out of the office, huh? Little lake time, family and friends? It's a sad reminder that my friends and family and my coworkers are the same people. RICHIE: Think fast. Ooh. Well Dad, do you want me to look over the Kendall agreement? You know she brought the paperwork, did you Mia? Come on, you're on vacation. You should be analyzing the inside of your eyelids. Mmm. Or my lips. You can analyze those too. (PHONE RINGING) Ooh. Oh come on, don't get it. MIA: Speak of the devil. Better answer. Mia Stone. Yeah, yeah Jason, yeah. Yeah, let me just call you back in 10 when I have it in front of me. Okay thanks, bye. RICHIE: Told you. Sorry. Mia, he's not going anywhere. Hey, I'll be right back. You guys do your thing. Come on, let's go. (BOAT STARTING) (REVVING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Come back! (GASPING) MIA VOICEOVER: That was the last time I saw him. It was the first vacation he took in 22 years. (CLACKING) Hey, honey, what are you doing up? You hungry? You want some toast or cheese? Yeah. Do you have to go to work? I am just gonna take care of a couple things and I'll be right back. OLIVE: We're supposed to have tea later. Can you make that? Of course. Hey babe. Hey. (LIGHT MUSIC) Pancakes? (BANGING) Dang it! Can't I get a break? (SOMBER MUSIC) All right lady, wake up! Let's go, let's get out of here! Holy crap, holy crap. STRANGER: Let's go. Holy crap. Just take my money, just take my money! I don't need your money. I got money. Now let's get outta here! No, just take my car and let me go. Not a chance. We're in this together, all right? Now put this car in gear and let's get out of here or we'll both gonna be in the slammer! (DRIVING MUSIC) Look, I don't know what you want from me or what I did to upset you, but, I have a little girl. And all I wanna do is see her again. And I'm sure all she wants to do is see you again. Now you do exactly as I say and we'll get you home in time for tea party. Can you at least tell me where we're going? Right here. Here? - Right? - Right here. We're here. Bring that bag of cash in. (LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC) Actually it's that way. Put that right there on the coffee table. Don't worry about that. I applaud the effort. (MYSTICAL MUSIC) It's not for you to see. At least, not yet. But this is. I figured since I pulled you out of the cafe, the least I could do is coffee. Oh, oh no, don't worry, no. No mickey slippy here. It's just hot Colombian coffee. (SIGHING) Mmm. Oh, sorry. Cream? Oh no, no, no, no. Here, here, here, wait. It's cream. I'm sorry. I can be a little weird sometimes. Why do you have a notebook with my name on it? You saw that. Are you stalking me? Stalking? That's a bit harsh. I've been watching. I've been observing you, kind of following. Yeah I guess you could say I was stalking. Listen, I don't know what you want from me or what you're gonna do but you don't have to do it. You can take this back. You can drop it off, you can drive away. I won't tell a soul. As long as you let me go. You've got a choice. You can make the right decision. Starting now. It's not too late. You know, (SIGHING) look out, I wish you were right. But, I'm kind of stuck in the past. You see Mia, you and I aren't that different. You know years ago, I was scheduled to go on a vacation. The first one since my dad had passed. But I wasn't prepared for what was to happen just before we left. You know, I loved my mother. She was a great woman, a kind woman. Always gave people the benefit of the doubt. And she was a great cook. She sounds like a great woman. She was hit by a truck. She was on her way to meet a old friend at her favorite cafe, Marie Catrib's. Actually, ever been there? (CHUCKLING) It's probably better that way. She didn't have to see the family business get ripped off by a friend that we trusted for years. Something to do with share redemption or something, I don't know. It was a lot of internal corruption. That's an awful story, but, Are you all right? All of a sudden, you don't look too good. You want some more coffee? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. (REVVING) (DRIVING MUSIC) MIA VOICEOVER: After waking up, I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Mo? MIA VOICEOVER: Was that real? Is this real? No Mo, no Leanne. What about Luisa? (BEEPING) Miss Mia. Didn't expect to see you today. Yeah, I, where's Luisa? I think you told her to take the day off, if I recall correctly. Oh, right, right. Are you okay? Should I call Luisa to come in? Oh no, no, I can. MIA VOICEOVER: Amanda's here, which is hardly comforting. But if she's here, then I can bet someone else is too. RICHIE: What are you doing here? MIA VOICEOVER: Yup. You're supposed to be on vacation, you workaholic. Did you get Chris Park that contract? Are you serious, Mia? I mean can you keep your little fingers out of just one thing, please? Do not turn this back on me. You said first thing. He doesn't have it, does he? (SIGHING) I can't afford to lose another potential client. You mean lose another client to Meta. Hey, hold on a second, where are you going? Benny's, I can do it myself. No. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just worried about you is all. You're going a million miles an hour and you're supposed to be on vacation. I got you two weeks at the Royal Crown, you've already cut that in half. If you do your job, You need to learn how to relax. I'm waiting to hear back from Benny. Go home. I'll call him and put the heat on and then I'll CC you when I send it to Chris in two hours. Okay? Just promise me you'll leave. Okay. Okay. Hey. You're going home. Yeah, just give me a minute. (LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC) MIA VOICEOVER: This isn't about a contract or even a company. It's about a legacy. A family. (CRUNCHING) Benny Silverman has been the family lawyer since before Stoneware existed. He runs a slew of companies with the help of his son Jacob. (COUGHING) Hey Jacob? Is your dad here? Oh, hey. Yeah he's in his office. Could I see him? Dad? Yeah, what? It's on, oh hey! MIA: Hey, Benny. What can I do for you, sweetheart? Oh, I need to wrap up that deal with Chris Park but Richie didn't send you the finalized agreement so here I am. What deal? With Chris Park, with Park Insurance. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? He didn't send over the preliminary agreement? Afraid not. You know, I never liked that kid, no offense. Hey, aren't you supposed to be in the Caribbean? Yeah, that was supposed to be this week and next but you know what two weeks at an all inclusive tropical resort does for you. I come back looking like a golden brown jet puffed marshmallow. So we're leaving tomorrow. Well I wish I'd received a contract to finish up for you but I'm afraid I didn't. (WATER GURGLING) You know what, I was wondering if you could take a look into that partnership agreement for Stoneware. You wanna buy him out? No it would take a real ice queen to Spartan kick him out of the company, but, You're a loyal partner, just like your father. You know, you'd have a hard time buying him out anyway because your dad really knew how to draw up a partnership agreement. Really? Yeah. He drafted something he called the loyalty clause which makes your buyout offer an agreement to be bought out up to five years later for that same amount. Wait, what? So. Let's say at the start of this contract, the little dick goes and blows all of his money and assets on things that stay in Vegas. Sounds like Richie. He has to sell his shares for a meal. And you're there on your high horse to buy him out for peanuts. Hmm. But guess what. What? Four years and 11 months later, Kevin took your kid and kicks you out of the house and you're on the street. You have to sell your shares back to Richie. Thanks. Guess for how much. Peanuts? Peanuts! (LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah, okay. Thanks, that's great Benny. Thou shall not lowball lest you be lowballed yourself. Noted, got it. Anyway, yeah, I'll take a look at it for you. Okay, thanks, Benny. BENNY: No problem. I live for this stuff. And a good ear of corn. Want some? No, never mind. Thanks. Don't worry about it, I'm sure it's fine. Thanks, Benny. Sure! Mia. There's something I wanna show you. (HUMMING) It's up this way. MIA: Okay. This here is a 1994 Four Winds recreational vehicle refurbished and ready to hit the road. Looks great, Benny. Yeah. It was your father's. He bought it as a clunker and then asked me and Jacob to fix her up. Then he passed away. I just thought I'd patch her up anyway. You know, he really did change there in those last few months. I'm not sure why. I mean who would have ever thought of Donald Stone as a boating kind of a guy anyway? I really think he just wished for the two of you to spend more time out of the office together. Benny. I had this dream. I passed out in my car in front of Marie Catrib's today. Really? Getting much sleep? Right? And I had this dream where this old man kidnapped me, he had this big bag of cash and he took me to his house and he drugged me with a cup of coffee. Uh huh, what happened next? And then he told me this story about how he went on vacation and lost everything in the same week. He lost his company, he lost his family. I think maybe you've been under a lot of stress. But it was so real. I know what his house smelled like. I know how the cup of coffee tasted. It was the worst coffee I'd ever had in my life. Then I just, I suddenly woke up. So. Maybe this old man with a bag of cash really drugged you and then drove you back to Marie Catrib's. (LAUGHING) I know, it's ridiculous. - It's crazy. - No it isn't. It's really very telling. Maybe this is your subconscious talking to you. What's it saying? What's it asking of you? Hey. It's yours if you want it. MIA: Thanks Benny, but, I mean it looks great. Oh and if you ever need a massage just give me or Jacob a call. For you we'd do 30 an hour. Since when are you a masseuse? The 2006 recession. And it's massage therapist. There's a big difference. Noted. I'll keep it in mind. (REVVING) KEVIN: Because you told me to. OLIVE: So I did it. KEVIN: It might be a prince. Princes are better. OLIVE: Princesses are better. That's why I dressed you up. KEVIN: And what does a princess do again? OLIVE: A princess, she's pretty. KEVIN: Right. OLIVE: She's nice. KEVIN: Mhmm. OLIVE: And they do things. KEVIN: What do they do? OLIVE: So you gotta be quiet and do the tea party. KEVIN: I'll do the tea party. OLIVE: There's not much tea left. Would you like the last cup? Sure. (KNOCKING) (GASPING) Mommy! Hey, sweetheart. So, who are you today? OLIVE: I'm just me. But I invited the Duchess of Queensbridge for tea. How do you do? Playing dress up, sounds good. Why don't you and I do more of that? Olive, I think mommy and daddy might need some alone time. Not now, look it up. All right. What are you doing home, Mom? I'm on vacation. Would you like to join the tea party? Wait a minute. You said once you ran out of tea that you're gonna let Dad go pack. OLIVE: No, I have another kettle for Mom. So you were holding out on me this whole time? Yeah, I just need to get it ready. Okay. It's ready. So you told her you'd stop playing tea party once the imaginary tea was gone? Well we weren't sure when Mom was getting home today. When I got to work, everybody was surprised to see me. Even Benny told me I should go home in so many words. And what do we call that, a work-life balance? Yeah, yeah. That would be mommy's aim for the next 10 days. Well cheers to that. Speaking of which, work clothes do not do well for tea parties on the floor. OLIVE: Mom, I said your tea is ready. I know honey, I'm just changing into my royal family garb. KEVIN: So your mom is coming over dinner tonight to send us off. She's making that casserole, and the spinach strawberry raspberry thing she does. God, she loves you. KEVIN: Yeah she's - a great woman. - A great woman. - A kind woman. - A kind woman. STRANGER: Always gave people the benefit of the doubt. - And she was a great cook. - And she can cook. (TENSE MUSIC) Why are you talking like that? Hmm, like what? Mia? I just remembered that I told Mom that I was gonna meet her for brunch. No, Mom, you're having tea with me. KEVIN: Really? She's gonna see you tonight. I know, I know honey. I just actually wanna check in with her and see if she's okay. Mia. What's wrong? I'll be right back. I just have to check on something. What are you talking about? Is this really about your mother? It is, actually. What is it then? I gotta go. It's just that I passed up work so that we could all have this time together, all of us. And now you're making up excuses so you can go to work again? I'm not making up excuses, I'm not. So why are you leaving again? Because I had a bad dream that I'm not sure was a dream. I could have swore it was fake then you said what he said, and then... Okay, whatever. MIA: I'll be right back. When? Before the tea's gone. This is crazy. (CROWD CHATTERING) WAITRESS: Can I get you a table? Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. (SIGHING) Thank you. WAITRESS: Let me know if you need anything else. Okay. (SOFT MUSIC) Mia. What, how are you? I'm great. I'm sorry to bother you. I was just leaving. Mia? Mom? What are you doing here? I was looking for you. How'd you know I would be here? Do you have something to do with this? ROBERT: With what? With that weird guy with all the money. How do you? Honey, what are you even talking about? He was waiting here. He was planning something, weren't you? Well I know that. You know that? Wait, why? Were you meeting Robert here? Well, yes. Why? Oh, no, no. Nope. Mia, what has gotten into you? Into me? You're the one meeting up with that drunk. I got a tip that you were gonna be here and that you were in danger. And I'm onto you. You think I don't know why you're spending time with the woman who controls 20% of my company shares? She may buy your act but I don't. Stay away from my company and stay away from my family! Mia! Ugh. You can see, there's a real change in climate and there's a lot more to come. There's a big storm headed our way. Now a lot of rain, possible snow. I'd hurry outside if I were you. (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) Mom! What? (HONKING) ROBERT: Emma! Are you all right? Yeah I'm fine. That's my car. She didn't have to see the family business get ripped off by a friend that we trusted for years. I'm okay, I'm fine. Mom, I need a favor. You need a favor? Well I don't know if it's 'cause I almost repainted a tow truck or because you were being so catty but I am not interested. No, mom, I need a car. I have to get back to the office. Well you know I don't drive. I could drive. Very funny. He stopped drinking six months ago. Excuse me. Do you want your check? Mom, do not spend another minute with him. You've got a big heart but he's not worth your time. I'm sorry. RICHIE: Tell me you're packing. Not exactly. Hey listen, do you trust your dad? My dad? Not as far as I can throw him. Why, what's up? I'm kind of meeting up with my mom. I think he's gonna make a grab for the shares in my trust or something. Really? What makes you say that? Look, she controls 20%. He sold the rest of his stock to her a couple of years ago because he was broke and he's probably bitter about it. Plus I got this dream. WAITRESS: Miss Hoffman? Yeah? Your card's been declined. RICHIE: You had a dream? Richie, why was my company card declined? Would you calm down? You sound manic. You gotta try to be less paranoid. Go home. I'm hanging up now. Richie. Richie, are you there? Here. Here's 20, keep the change. All right, yeah, this is it. Thanks. What the? Fig Newtons? Hey Benny, can you take a look at that agreement I was asking you about? I'm concerned I don't know enough - about this partnership. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Hold on a second. Call me back. Who are you? - What's going on? - Miss. Excuse me, I just need to see your ID and I need you to sign in before you take another step. Okay, big guy, who are you? I'm Security Officer Jordan, aight? We've implemented some now safety procedures trying to protect the tenants of this building, that's all, so I just need to see your ID and I need you to sign in please. I am the tenant of this building. I'm the owner of Stoneware, Mia Stone? Okay, I understand. Been here five years. I understand all of that. I still need to see some ID. Fine. Thank you. Fine, here you go, I've got one right there for you. Says Maya Hoffman. It's Mia and I'm married now. Sign in sheet's over there, all right? Great, I'll go do that. Thank you. JORDAN: ID of a Mia Hoffman, please, thank you. Wait, what's going on here? Just fill out the sheet and wait here until I can get verification from a tenant, okay? I am a tenant, a verified tenant. I can verify myself. Get it done please, all right, and wait here. It won't be that long. Thank you. Well thank you. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, have you found anything? Definitely. It looks like you need to exercise your option to redeem the shares on the Stoneware trust. Yeah well I know that but I'm not gonna buy the shares. We're keeping them in the trust. Okay, but as of midnight, your partner can buy them. And if he buys all those stocks, then he overtakes you as majority shareholder. Yeah but Richie's not gonna do that. We talked about it. You talked about it? Did you write it down? Mia, he bought you 10 days at a resort in another country, on the same week that your right of redemption ends. Well he can't do it without me knowing, right? Well that's what I'm confused about. He has to put his offer into writing and you have to agree upon it. Did he mention anything about an agreement? No, he hasn't said anything and I haven't signed anything. BENNY: Jacob! What are you doing?! Benny? Benny, I have to call you back. Just get everybody and K9 right now, okay? Please, right now. Okay. Hey, hey! Mia? MIA: Unhand me, you musclebound beefcake! My name is on the building! Sure it is. Hey, boss. What's going on, guys? Well we couldn't leave just yet. What, what happened? Well we wanted to talk to you 'cause we feel that we haven't been treated properly today. And well, quite frankly, it's just not like you guys. Yeah I've been here so long I really don't know what else to do. I can't afford... Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. You were fired? Well, yes ma'am. That's why we're here. We're hoping you'll hear us out and maybe reconsider. Leanne, Mo, I didn't fire you. I didn't even hear about this. I would never fire you two. Damn, good. 'Cause I was actually out here to mess up your car. Now I don't feel the need to do that anymore. (CHUCKLING) Oh. Well, that's settled. Guys? Give me a hand and we will straighten this out together. MIA VOICEOVER: Silly Officer Jordan. He thinks Mo can just be replaced. But that gentle giant was my father's first hire. No, you gotta go. Look, you gotta get outta here, okay? I cannot let you in the building, all right? You've been relieved of your duties, you can't be here. MIA VOICEOVER: They played on the same college team together and he was always known to run a few trick plays. You can't be here, all right? You gotta go. (KNOCKING) Stop knocking on the windows! I need you to get off the premises. Look, don't make me come out there, all right? I said, don't make, (KNOCKING) This guy. Off the door, are you deaf? You can't be here. Go home. What? You're starting to irritate me. Go home. Hey! Hey what? Really? You! (CHUCKLING) What are you do? Hey that's private property! You need to put that. (DINGING) ELEVATOR VOICE: Going up. (CLINKING) MIA: What's taking so long? Shh. Hey! What are you doing? I'm just doing maintenance. JORDAN: Where? 406. 406, so you're gonna take this trash can up four flights of stairs? No. Elevator's that way. Why don't you just use that? It's broken, right? No, ma'am. Just follow me. (WHISTLING) MIA VOICEOVER: Leanne's been the head janitor of Stoneware since its doors opened. I played hide and seek with her in this lobby when I was a kid. I don't think either of us had any idea it would come in handy. (DINGING) There you go. Can you help me? It's a lot easier than the stairs, isn't it? LEANNE: Oh, thank you. No problem. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, hey wait a minute, hey, hey! It worked! Never thought this is how my day would go. You're telling me. (LAUGHING) Good luck. Let's push for total acquisition. But if they want some type of acquisition merger that's gonna have to be dependent on my position which of course will be acting CEO. What's going on here? Richie. What are you doing here? I had to sneak past Mo 2.0 to get in my own company. My card was declined, now there's a bougie sports car in my parking spot. I don't know. But I think maybe you have something to do with it. Mia, Mia, I don't know what in the world you're doing. Stop, I know. You're aiming for majority shareholder. You bought me a vacation so you could buy up all the shares when I was in the Caribbean. You lied to my face, why? So you could sell the company to Meta? Exactly. Except you got one thing wrong. I'm not gonna try and buy the shares. I already have. What are you talking about? See this? That's your signature. You're trying to keep this company out of sentiment, okay? It's impractical. I trusted you, Richie. Yeah well. Get her out of here. Let's go. - Let's go! - Take your sweat mittens off me! I run this place! And that doesn't change until midnight no matter what that paper says. You know this company belongs to my family. Enjoy your vacation, Mia. Give my best to Kevin. JORDAN: Calm down! Ow! (BASHING) Ooh, that had to hurt. Sorry. JORDAN: Get her out of here. MIA: Let me go! Let me go! Sorry about that gentlemen. Where were we? CEO. RICHIE: Yes, yes, that would be me. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? MIA: Hey Mom, it's me. Are you at my house? Mia, whose phone are you calling from? The 62nd precinct, where are you? What are you doing at the police station and where's your phone? They're just holding on to it for me for a little while. I'm calling because I may need your help. Are you in prison? No mom, of course not. I'm in jail. You're not there with Kevin, are you? Look, Mom, listen. I need you to break open that slot machine piggy bank and count out the quarters. We're aiming for 7500 dollars here. Honey, I can't do that. You're being serious? That's from Reno, your father got it for me. Okay, okay then. Your bunk hole money, your pinot stash, anyway you can, I need it to get here as soon as possible, okay? I don't have that kind of money and I don't have a car. When'll I go to the police station anyway? I don't know. I don't know. The basic idea here is that you get to the precinct and bail me out in as timely a manner as possible. I have to save Dad's company from Richie Howell. Save the company? What happened? I'll explain to you when you get here but time is of the essence, okay? Well, I mean I can try. Whatever you do, do not tell Kevin that I'm in jail or that you bailed me out in jail or anything about jail or any of this. GUARD: Time's up! Mom, mom, I've gotta go, okay? I'm gonna see you soon, right? Right? MIA VOICEOVER: I don't know why I thought everything was going fine. I've lost my dad during my obsession with work and now, losing Stoneware, my connection to my dad. I'm losing everything, God, I need your help. STRANGER: I'm glad you're here. Holy sh... No power, no hope. Guard? Guard? Your illogical and overwhelming fear of loss has realized. Do you see that guy? (RETCHING) Not the answer I was looking for. What do you have now, huh? What? What do you have now that hasn't been given to you? That can't be taken away? Your company? Your money? Family? Freedom? I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you kidnapped me, drugged me and then with some sick insight of yours tipped me off about the company. What about your mom? And the truck? You don't have to be afraid, Mia. I'm not afraid of you. Good. 'Cause I'm not going anywhere. Who are you? I am who I am. And that's all that I am. (CHUCKLING) That answer is so vague. I now wanna punch you in your vague face. You wanna know what happens next, don't you? Is that it? Are you from the future? Look, Mia. The past is set, can't change it. The future, not so set. Not in the way that your little brain can fathom. But it all begins here. It all begins now. What can I do? I'm stuck here in jail as my conniving business partner steals my company. I almost killed my mom trying to stop her from being killed. I feel like no matter what I do I'm destined to lose everything. Just like I lost my dad. And I'm going crazy. (SOMBER MUSIC) Maya Hoffman? It's Mia. You've been bonded, pack your stuff. BENNY: Hey, sweety. So I don't know how he did it but it looks like you did in fact sign some kind of an agreement between you and Richie. Yeah, thanks. BENNY: And I've got it right here in front of me. (LAUGHING) Look, everything changes at midnight so you gotta call me back ASAP. I'd give it a 10 on the priority meter. Jacob! Jacob no! No, no, no, no, not that one! No, no, no, no. Shoot! What took you so long? EMMA: Do you mind telling me why I'm bailing you out? Richie's trying to take my company shares. I need to get to Benny's. How'd you get the cash anyway? Hey Mia. Robert paid $7,000 to post your bail. And he'll get it back soon. And then that's it with him. He's up to something. No, Mia, he's not! He's not, he's just looking for forgiveness. Are you the only one with a free pass? Are you the only one with a get out of jail free card? He was the one driving the boat that day. I think that's a little different. I lost him too, Mia! It was an accident. It was an accident. RICHIE: Hey Dad, think fast. (CHUCKLING) Were you drinking when you were driving that boat? No. Were you drunk? I didn't start drinking till after the accident. Oh, well, congratulations. You were sober when you flipped a boat and killed my dad! (SOMBER MUSIC) We're going to Benny's. Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. BENNY: Mia! Benny, Benny, where are you? BENNY: Come to my office. I'm printing everything out now. Okay we'll be there in five. Hey, punch it, we have to get to Benny's. We are not endangering everyone's lives just so you can make it to the lawyer. Mom, stop. Will you just let me talk to Robert? This is important. - Oh. - Come on. As important as the school council meeting at Chad Baker's house when his parents weren't home? Mom, not now! Or as important as a softball tryout Are you going like - 20 miles per hour? - That you never really attended. Fine. 15 minutes, we'll be there in 15 minutes. Happy? Mhmm. (SIGHING) This is Richie's little deal that you inadvertently signed. It exercises his right of redemption making him the majority shareholder. Little twerp went to another lawyer to have it written up. So Richie is taking control of the company? That is not fair. Not yet. This other lawyer, a friend of mine by the name of Joe Epstein. He sent this over to me. And he dated it for today. But we all know that your right of redemption doesn't expire until midnight tonight. So does that save me? JACOB: Coffee? Unfortunately, no it doesn't. Come midnight, he owns the shares. Here's the ticker. This is the Stoneware partner's agreement. With the five year cycle that I was telling you about? Now section seven specifies the right of redemption that Richie's playing around with. And that same section also lays out the loyalty clause in another paragraph. And guess what? (CHUCKLING) Good old Joe Epstein didn't specify which paragraph this agreement refers to. Tomorrow, this is Richie's right of redemption. But today, it's an offer to buy you out. Get it? JACOB: Anybody else want some more coffee? Hey, happy feet, save it. Mia, in the original partnership agreement, what does Richie's buyout mean? (TENSE MUSIC) It's an agreement to buy him out at the same amount. Benny! Benny, you're a genius! This is all your father's work. Frankly it's a little convoluted if you ask me. So Richie's left an open door for me to buy him out and he doesn't even know it yet. He knows that he doesn't own the company until tomorrow. He's waiting for the clock to strike midnight. So we have to find Richie, we have to get him a counter-offer. He's already signed the paperwork so we just need a notary. You don't need a notary. Are you sure? Yeah. I am one. Of course you are, Benny. What's the offer? 100,000. Dollars? Cash. Actually, it's more like peanuts comparatively. Clearly, he didn't expect you to look at the offer while signing it. Benny, do you have anything? I hate to ask but you know this would be a loan. I would, but I can't get my hands on that kind of cash before midnight. And this transaction needs to be completed before the right of redemption expires. (LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC) A measly 100K. Hmm. Where's Robert? Did he leave? Figures. Kid. You doing all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm just racking my brain trying to figure out what I can do. Yeah. I worked at my Dad's firm in the 80s. Cut my shark teeth on his business model. Then he got sent into prison for tax evasion and other things. (LAUGHING) I was heir to the throne. Now the throne was no Stoneware, but if there's anything worse than having big shoes to fill, it's having dirty shoes to fill. It eventually crashed and burned on my watch. And I know it wasn't my fault, but, I can't help but feel like I let him down. Like I failed him. But, life goes on. Anyway, you wanna ride? Yeah, yeah. I guess I'll need one. I got just the thing. (LIGHT MUSIC) I'll be right back. You guys do your thing. DONALD: He's not going anywhere. 10 minutes, that's all. I love you. You too. That's an awful story, but, Are you all right? All of a sudden, you don't look too good. You want some more coffee? No, no, no, no. (THUDDING) I brought you here for a specific reason. To tell you that story. Kevin. Hey. I can explain everything. My right of redemption on the company shares expires tomorrow. And it's all going to Richie unless I come up with $100,000 and an agreement by midnight. But we don't have it. I called. You couldn't explain any of this in the five times I called? You don't understand the day that I've had. I've been packing all day and the later and later and later it got, I'm thinking to myself, why am I not just packing a bag for me and Olive? We could have just gone on vacation by ourselves. Kevin. Then I think, that's ridiculous. Thank you. You're going. No, I was doing this for you, for us. Oh, really? No, you're going. You're going on a vacation by yourself. And this way, you'll be free of all the burdens of both work and home. No. No because I can't lose you too. Do you know why I'm holding on to Stoneware with white knuckles? Because Don Stone is gone. He left me and this is all I have left of him and I can't possibly stand to lose anything more than I already have! I don't want you to lose the company. But I don't wanna lose you either. I want you to do things for us, I want you to do things for Olive. And if you lose the company, we'll figure it out, together. Really? Yeah. Okay. Do you think that God sends angels to us? Yeah. I know he does. God always finds a way of showing up and providing for us, of guiding us. And sometimes that's the only way we know what was meant to be and what isn't. (DOORBELL DINGING) Hey! Listen, I don't need this. I appreciate the gesture but I'm being serious. No. I just wanted to... No, you don't owe me anything. I'm sorry I held this against you for so long. Listen, it's not your fault. One accident doesn't define you. You are one of the kindest people I know. I'm just learning that now. It's who you are. Robert. The money. You're a good person yourself, Mia. Don't let your father's company go to Richie. He doesn't care about the people. He only cares about the money. How did you get $100,000 in 20 minutes? Don't trust the banks. Better hurry up. Are you driving a Winnebago? So I'm gonna need you to call Mo because we're gonna need muscle, and Leanne. Leanne will not want to miss this. Will do. I can't believe Richie would do this. I actually can. And Benny, give Benny a call. I need him to draft me up something real quick. Okay it takes 30 minutes to get to Richie's house. Then how are we gonna get in? If I know Richie, he's not gonna be at his place come midnight. Well where would he be? I'll meet you at the office. (CHILL MUSIC) We have six minutes. What if he won't sign? He already signed. I just have to get the cash in his hands. I think the elevator's been deactivated. The stairs. (CHILL MUSIC) (KEYS CLINKING) (ELEVATOR DINGING) (CHILL MUSIC) Hey boss, remember earlier today when we were in - the elevator together? - Yeah, that was wild. I know, it was crazy. (LIGHT ROCK MUSIC) MIA: What time is it? 11:56, we still have time, we're good, don't worry. Amanda? Oh, hey guys. What are you doing here? MIA: Where's Richie? Oh yeah. Richie! Mia's coming for you! MIA: There he is! Let's go, go. (DINGING) Oh, hey there. Hey! What do you all want from me, huh? You know, I'm gonna take you up on that offer you gave me earlier today. Your shares are mine. You think I'm gonna sell my shares, you're crazy. But you already did. All I have to do is give you the cash. Give it! AMANDA: Richie, under the reception desk! Give it up! It's over, Richie. You got that right. Whoah. Dude, a little too much. Get out. Back off! You do realize you just broke into my property, don't you? Do I have the right to defend myself? Not yet. My watch says midnight. No, no, no, it's definitely 11:58. Shut up. I trusted you. Don't you see I'm trying to save this place? I mean you want to keep your precious little Ma and Pa? Wake up and smell the coffee, Mia. Meta's consuming our entire market. The world is waving a giant flag in your face saying think bigger! You either sell now or you dry up and vanish into oblivion! But not me, no. No I'm thinking of the future. And you're not a part of it. Do it then. Mia, no. Put it down. Don't test me, Mia. It's 100,000, sound like a deal? No, no, no! Time's up, dick, Hey! (GUN FIRING) Coffee. (CLINKING) STRANGER: What do you have that hasn't been given to you? Enjoy your vacation, Mia. STRANGER: Freedom? Family? But I don't wanna lose you either. STRANGER: No power, no hope. He's not going anywhere. (GLASS SHATTERING) (GRUNTING) Get your hands off me! LEANNE: You dodged a bullet. How'd you do that? (FAX BEEPING) Benny's right on time. She's the one trespassing! I'm the owner! Okay, she can't just waltz in here and take this company back, it's mine! Wait a minute! Who's the owner here?! I am! She is. And so is she. What? And so are they. LEANNE AND MO: What? Mo, Leanne, Luisa, I'm gonna need your signatures here. What's it for? It's for a share in stock in Stoneware Inc. I'm giving you all partial ownership of the company. (LAUGHING) No ma'am, I cannot. No ma'am. Just Mia. This is ridiculous. The same kind of bad decision-making that's held this company back. You're gonna drive your father's business into the ground. Mo, can you help Mr. Hulk here escort this man off the premises and into a police car? Yes, ma'am. As long as that's okay with you guys. - Oh, yes, ma'am. - Oh yeah, absolutely. You're gonna pay for this. Oh, yeah that reminds me. Wouldn't wanna leave without that. And you're fired. Mia, thank you. Thank you, Luisa. You've been a loyal assistant and friend for this company for so many years even before I was ever your boss. And for that, I'm making you Executive Vice President. Executive Vice President? I mean, I don't know if I can. I have a feeling you could. Actually I know you could. What do you say? (CHUCKLING) This is a huge misunderstanding. I'm being framed. Could I get a break here!? Hey, I don't deserve to be in here. This is my company. STRANGER: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. You're the real deal, the head honcho. You're the owner, right Richie? Sorry, who are you? Whoah, whoah! What are you doing, man? How's it feel? Don't shoot. I'm sorry, I'll do whatever you want. What do you say? Please? Please! It's too late. (LAUGHING) You should see your face. (CHILL MUSIC) MIA VOICEOVER: I can't believe how much my life has changed in the last two days. I almost lost my company to Richie Howell. Fortunately, Stonewall was built from the ground up. Oh, you read my mind. Oh thank you, Miss Lady. MIA VOICEOVER: On coffee and loyalty. Looking good. Uh hey, Miss Hernandez. LUISA: Just call me Luisa. Gotcha. Thanks, Luisa. Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. - Good morning. (SIGHING) Shall we get started? - Yes. - Yes. Please sit. MIA: Are you seeing Aunt Jenny later? OLIVE: Yeah I'm going to a dance lesson with Aunt Jenny. MIA: Yeah, are you really going dancing or are you going to a rager? OLIVE: I don't know what a rager is. Okay, I think that's later in life. I guess I'll trust you for now. Oh, look who we woke up. Daddy, go back to bed. What? Why do I have to go back to bed? Breakfast in bed can't be in the kitchen. You can't? You sure? All right, okay. Back to bed. Okay, keep stirring, I'll be right back. (SNORING) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) I thought I was getting breakfast in bed. I'm working on it. It's day one. Day one of what? Family vacation. Oh, family vacation? I like the sound of that. Even better than the Caribbean? As long as you're here. Good. 'Cause we missed our flight. I figured that might happen. So what's on the itinerary? No work? It's in good hands. Hmm. So what then? Is it time for some dressup? Yeah, sounds good. Or, I was thinking, (UPLIFTING MUSIC) MIA VOICEOVER: I never knew someone was watching me but it's comforting to know that someone is watching over me. Even if he was a stranger at first. Because I could never have been prepared for what happened just before I left. But he was. And he saved my company, my family. He even saved me. Mommy, come play dolls with me. Okay. I'll be right there. MIA VOICEOVER: There will always be things that demand your attention. But loyalty is deciding ahead of time which things are most important and then doing those things no matter what. So, Kev. How's the driving up there anyway? Hey, don't make me come back there. Mommy, where are we going? I don't know. I guess we'll find out.
