Do you have any idea the hoops that I had to jump through to get away on a Saturday? - No. Tell me. - It doesn't really matter. - It does matter. It matters to me. - Oh my God. - What do you think I had to do, honey? Hmm? I had to lie. - Of course. Of course you had to lie, Phil. - What? What are you? We're not. Jess, come on. Would you stop? Look, I'm sorry. - Such a fucking idiot. I'm a walking cliche. - You're not a cliche. - Hey. Watch it. - You know what? Go fuck yourself. - What? - Not you, that drunk dip shit back there. - You're so rude. - Yes. You know what? I am rude. I'm a rude guy, and I'm super pissed off right now. And it's a fucking shit show out here. So can we please just go back to your apartment? - No. God, you don't get it, do you? Such a fucking narcissist, you only care about yourself. We are done. - Really? - Yes. Really. - Well, that's great, Jess. That is just great. You know what? Merry fucking Christmas! - All right, Brian. I'll smoke outside. - [Phil] Jess. Come on, Jess, please. - Happy Hanukkah. - Fuck off. (grunting) (screaming in pain) - This guy hit an elf on the shelf. - I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. - No. He was talking shit. I heard him. - Whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa. Guys, guys. Let's make this right, okay? - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

That whole pool table is leveled with them. It's really nice to see you. For real. You know, I saw in "Fast Company" that you unloaded Braintree, that's pretty big. In "Barrens", they said the deal was good. That's awesome. - [Phil] Yeah. - [Charlie] I hope that's not the reason that we lost touch. - No, no. - Because it's water under the bridge. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, how did you know that was me? - Actually, I didn't at first. But I thought I recognized your gate. 'Cause when you walk, sometimes your shoulders don't move. I don't know if you know that about yourself, but then I saw your wallet on the ground and I was like- - Oh, yeah. What? Do you have it? - I actually. Oh, now that you mention it, don't have it. I didn't pick it up, such an idiot. - [Phil] No, no. It's fine. - No, it's not fine. I saw it on the ground. - I really should go. - I think I was just so happy that it was you. - It's fine. Don't worry about it, man. You know what? I gotta go find it. - No. Hey, hang out. Wait wait, wait wait wait. We just got here. Have a drink. I have a tab here. - No no, no no. It's, I.

Must have missed it. - Yeah. Someone threw out sugar fish. - Look, look Charlie. Take your hands outta the garbage, all right. Forget the wallet. It's gone. - [Charlie] When Jesus body slammed you, that wallet went flying. - Phil Shriver? - Jesus Christ. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You know what, Trey? Do me a favor. Fuck all the way off, please. I have no clients over here for you to steal right now. - I knew that when I quit, you were gonna go downhill. But I did not realize that I would find you with, what? Homeless Paul Bunion, dumpster diving. I mean, this is just perfect. All right, hey. Merry Christmas. You're doing great. - Thank you so much. - Say hi to Babe. This is my Christmas gift. It's incredible. - What an asshole. - One of my former partners, Trey Reynolds. Thank you for the effort. I gotta go. - You sure? We could have another drink? - Also, full disclosure, the woman that you saw me with earlier today, not my wife. It's complicated, obviously. I mean, like everything else in life, it's just endlessly complicated. - Phil, I get it. Go in the ocean, you're gonna get hit by a few waves. You've got all your riptide, and undercurrent. Mother Nature is a beast that is literally trying to kill you. So, what do you do? Stand there, and and take hit after hit and just keep going. - When's your book come out? - It's a cookbook, so I don't know if it's gonna be as helpful in that area, but. - All right. Well, look. Thank you for trying. Great seeing you. I gotta go. - Let me call you an Uber. - No no, no no. There's a cab coming right here. I got it. - Let me give you some cash, come on. I have a little cash, come on. Take the cash. - I owe you. Okay? - Stop, you don't. It's just good to see ya. Get home safe. - [Phil] Hi. 72nd and Madison. (calm music) - Six, one.

Others are saying they don't. So confusing. All everyone can agree on is wash your hands. - All right, honey. Try this. You know what? Let's not go zero to 60 every five seconds, okay? - Oh, I'm sorry. Have you seen the news? All I'm saying- - Yes, I have seen the news. - If you think we need masks, Ricky and Ray probably got extra, so. - Oh, hell no. - Okay, you're the one that brought up masks. - Yeah, but honey, we're not gonna go an hour out of our way to get anything from your brothers, all right.

Don't, you know, touch anything. - You gotta hit the button. - Yeah, I know. I will. Ah, shit. I just touched the rail. God damn it. God, yeah. Is that all we have? - You always said it was bad for you. - I know. We can order more. - No, Amazon's out. - How the fuck is Amazon out? - Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much.

He's going, Is he not going in? - He's waiting for us. He has separation anxiety. Adrian told us.

So he was gonna talk to you and, you know, give you this skinny on the dorms, get you all psyched. - Dad, that's so extra. - Why, you wanna know what to expect when you go in the Fall, right? - They might not be open. - Oh, they're gonna be open. Okay, trust me. And you're gonna go. You still waiting for that girl to accept your friend request? - No. I haven't asked her yet. - Okay. Well, you know.

And our state bye state coronavirus tracking- - All right. - Jesus Christ. - Well, Max is in his room, online, still trying to get the popular kids to be his friends. - Well, good. Good for Max. He needs friends. - You think that's gonna help make him want to go to boarding school? - He's really nervous about going, you know. - He wasn't a couple months ago. - [Reporter] The coronavirus risk- - Yeah, gee. I wonder what's happened. - [Reporter] The President's own advisors make it clear, he is out of touch with reality. - He should have worked with Ricky and Ray last Summer. - That would've somehow there prepared him, for what we are experiencing today? - Probably, yeah. - I got him the internship at Goldman Sachs. - It was a summer with college kids, who wouldn't give him the time of day. Did wonders for him, socially and emotionally. - Well, it's gonna look a hell of a lot better on his resume than, you know, working at your brother's freaking pizza joint. - You're such a fucking snob. - Why is my concern for our son's future and wellbeing somehow an indictment of me? - You turned it into an indictment of you. - Oh, well. I'm sorry that I worked so hard for this family. - Oh, oh. Max and I know really well how hard you work. All we hear is you, is you stomping and walking around, screaming into your phone. I do not think it's healthy for our son to hear his father say things like, I'm gonna tear your neck outta your fucking asshole. - What's your point? - My point is, we didn't have to hear this before. You used to be at an office. - What do you want me to do? - I don't know. Lisa's husband Zooms from the bathroom. - Lisa's husband's a fucking idiot. - Here we go, because he doesn't make boatloads of money being a teacher. - No, because he Zoom schools from the freaking toilet. - Okay.

Sorry to tell you this over a voicemail, but I'm gonna have to pull out my funds. Moving over to Trey Reynolds's shop. All right, man.

And Max, do not think for one second that this is gonna get you outta going to boarding school. - I was thinking. Maybe we could all go for a hike tomorrow in Montauk. - Oh, yeah. How am I supposed to do that? - It was just a suggestion. - Well, the fund is on the brink right now because of Trey Reynolds. Now I have people that I'm responsible to, all right. I have other people that I'm responsible for. Any way you slice it, I don't have the kind of time - You don't want to hike?

Jesus Christ, man. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay it's okay. What are you doing here? - It got really bad in the city, and I panicked. - So you came here? You scared the shit out of my family in the middle of the night. - I found your wallet. - You found my wallet? - [Charlie] So I hopped in an Uber. - Wait, you took an Uber here? Charlie, the driver could have been sick. - We made a pact. We said tell each other right now, have you seen anyone that might have covid? And he said, absolutely not. He said he only had like six roommates. But I was wearing a mask 70% of the time. - This is one of the stupidest things you've ever done in a very long list of stupid things. You realize that? - I live alone. And I read that people are dying of loneliness. - [Phil] It's been two weeks. - That's a long time not to see anybody. - Charlie, what do you want? - Can I stay here? - You're kidding. - Just until the city calms down, you know? And it, and it. You owe me. - Are you bringing up Braintree now? - No. The other night? You said you owe me. Remember, 'cause of that blonde girl? - [Phil] He's agreed to quarantine on the other side of the house. - You already let him in? - Well, yeah. - Phil! - What? What? I drew an imaginary line on the floor. I said, I, I, I said you do not cross, okay? And you know, I mean. He didn't look sick. - He could be asymptomatic, which if everything I read on Twitter is true, that means he could have it, which means you're gonna get it, which means Max and I are definitely gonna get it next. - Oh, God. - Relax, Max. Okay. Look, Charlie is not asymptomatic. All right, trust me. If he had this thing, he would have serious, serious symptoms by now. I mean, he's a, he's portly. (tape stretching out) Okay, see. Here's the line. - I don't think you understand how an airborne virus works. - Wow, Phil. Your family is quite breathtaking. - Yeah, yeah. This is our son, Max. - Mad Max. Nope, right. The line. - That's right. - You know, your dad and I used to be pretty tight. Lived together for a while. He was so intense. He would fart, and the power would go out. Nothing, okay. - And this is my wife, Rosie. - Enchante. Whoa, right. The line. Got it. Rosalia, Rosalita? Doesn't matter. You're even more gorgeous than I dreamed, not dreamed. I wasn't dreaming about. Imagined. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Charlie. So what do you have on my husband? - I don't have anything, I. - Just answer the question. - I um, found his wallet, 'cause we hung out the other day. - Did you like my husband when you first met him? - What? No, yes. When I first met him the last time? Or when I first met him, like ever? - Do you have trouble telling the truth? - Not generally, but I am very nervous right now by your line of questioning. - I still got it. Clean towels upstairs. Help yourself. Welcome. Max, let's go. - What a peach. What a welcoming, welcoming vibe. - Listen, we're gonna go back to bed. Okay? Just try to keep it down and, I'll see you in the morning. - Yeah, it's like I'm not even here. Hey, Phil? - Yeah. - I just wanna let you know what you're doing, it's a real mitzvah. - Yeah, It really is. - Okay, Phil? - Yes. - What do I do if I get hungry, or thirsty, or I run outta my medicated wipes and I need toilet paper? 'Cause the line. - Okay, you may occasionally, from time to time, quietly cross the line. - Like a little bit of times I can cross the line. - But, you know. - Got it. - Okay. - [Charlie] Hey, Phil? - Yes? - Is this one of those times? 'Cause I feel like- - No, no. - Yep, got it. - If we're not gonna respect the line, then, you know, what are we doing? - I'm a hugger, so it's gonna be hard in this new normal. - Let's respect the line. - Of course. - All right. - Good night. - Respect the line. Oh, hey, Phil? Pretty positive. I forgot the medicated wipes. So I'm gonna need some TP whenever you. (birds singing) (snoring) (upbeat music) Philly boy, that's gorgeous. Gotta drink. And if I'm going eat. Bloody Mary? - He's trying to steal my entire client roster. Yes, I'm keenly aware that I've had a couple down years, Andrew. No one is more aware of that than me. Braintree is, you can't recreate that all right. That was a one time thing. It was the invisible unicorn. - Good morning, everybody. - Listen, I gotta go all right. Start filing. - Phil, this house is amazing. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Listen, I'm making some green smoothies for me and Max. You want one? - Oh, you know what? No, I'd actually rather have a big tall glass of warm piss. I said I'd rather have a tall glass of warm piss. Can he not hear it? - Really? - Just a little hair of the dog. You don't have to be so judgy. - Wait, where did you even find the mixer for that? - In your bar. - Oh, dude. That stuff's like three Summers old. - I guess that's why it's like kind of, has a fur. - Listen, um. About last night. - Yeah. What was that? - I know. - Your wife came at me like fucking Julianna Margoles. - I know. She was irritated with me. - Yeah, well. She's scared me. - She's scary. I know. You wobbled on all of your answers. - Well, I didn't think I was gonna have a deposition in the middle of the fucking night. - Yeah, well just because she doesn't practice anymore doesn't mean my wife is still not a brutal cross examiner. Keep that in mind. - Maybe you should tell her that every once in a while. I'm sure she would love to hear it. - I gotta go. This is for you. Button this. - Wait.

I made the bread. - God, I really want to make the bread. Is it good? - Well, I'm making the bread right now. It's still rising, so. - I'm Charlie, by the way. - Emma. - Kind of like pandemic roommates with the neighbors. - I'm just out here on my every 10 minute fresh air break, you know, required by the CDC or whatever. - No, I know. I try to take one every five minutes. - Life in a pandemic. - Well, I will throw a bag over for you, maybe. - Oh my God. Thank you. And I'll throw over some sourdough if it turns out good. - Oh, it doesn't matter good or bad. They're gluten free in there and I'm, I'm dying. (laughing) Well, it was nice having you check me out, so thank you. - Okay. I wasn't checking you out. But I like your fit. It's pandemic chic. Enjoy your weed. - Enjoy your wine. It's quite a pour.

Why would I hurt you? I just want to apologize. Please stop running. - No, no no. Then you stop. - Oh my God. I'm gonna have a heart attack. Oh, I feel it in my arm. This is where it starts. It starts in the arm. - I'm sorry I ran, you were just. You looked so angry, I was scared. - I'm not angry. I'm sorry I yelled. You can't go through my shit, you know. You need to ask for entree. - I came up there in peace. I just. I saw you talking to that girl, that woman, the neighbor. - Yeah, so? - Well, just. How do you do it, you know? - Are you implying because I look the way I do, and she's beautiful, that there's some sort of obstacle for me to overcome? - I just, it, it just looked easy for you. - Because I will let you know right now, chubby guys fuck. We put in that work. We'll eat you out for like a half hour, before I even think about what I'm getting. You know, we, we're generous lovers. - It's not that easy for me. I can't even get myself to follow this girl that I'm into on Instagram. - I don't know, my dude. You wanna talk to someone. The truth is, it's a what's the worst that could happen situation, you know? - Yeah. - I don't really know how to say this in a positive way, Phil, but I'm moving my accounts, and my money outta yours and putting them in with Trey. Since his departure, it really, it doesn't look good on your end. (calm music) - Who was it that said, kill all the lawyers? Was that Al Capone? - Whoa. Rough day. (knocking on door) - Who's there? - What you mean, who's there? It's Charlie. Can I come in? - Yeah. - See how I did that? How I asked if I could enter, waited for your response, then received the permission I was looking for? And now I shall go in. - Yeah, I saw. - This is a very, very cool room of a boy who is not quite a man, but not quite a boy. Sweet ax. - Thank you. I like your tattoos. - Oh, thanks. Yeah, I got enough tattoos to be a chef, but I don't cook. - I like your owl. - I got it for my grandma when she passed away. She was wise, but she also looked like an owl, so. And then I got this one down here. - [Max] I can't see it. - It's over here. It says lion hair. I got that when I was 16. I fell in love with this blonde girl, and my mom would say- - [Max] 16? - looks like someone got attacked by a lion. - Oh, what's that plane? - I got that for my dad, when he passed away. 'Cause he was a pilot. Better pilot than a dad, but a pretty good pilot. - That's sad. - And then this is an Eames chair. That's not for anyone that died. That's just an item that you will grow to covet. - What's an Eames chair? - You know, I been doing a little thinking about your lady problem, as it were. - [Max] Oh, okay. And would you? - I think I have a solution for you. - [Max] What is it? - Well, I think what you need, my friend, is what's called a hard reset. - No, I don't wanna lie. I don't wanna lie to her. - I'm not asking you to lie. I'm not saying full like a college scandal, Felicity Huffman shit. I'm just saying, you need to present this lady of yours with a new side of yourself, that maybe she hasn't seen. That way, she kind of takes you in with new eyes. A hard reset. - What if I make her laugh? 'Cause I make Sanjay laugh a lot, so I can be funny. - Oh, you're being serious about that. Oh, okay yeah. Let's go with that. - [Max] What? You don't think I can do it? - Oh, no no. I think you could be funny. Yeah, no, I think you. That was one of the first things I thought when I met you, was like this kid is, this kid is a crack off. - Okay, well then I don't, I don't want embarrass myself. I don't want her to laugh at me, then. You're right. - She won't laugh at you. Do something online. Just like write or make a meme. Shit out a meme. I don't know what the proper term for it is, but make a meme. - Okay. You sure? - Yeah. - Okay, so then. How do we make somebody laugh? - You just Google image social conscious pictures, and show all these images that have been shared by millions of people. You just pick one, and then you write a funny, witty caption. If the picture is King Kong climbing up the Empire State Building, you write underneath it, me until I've had my coffee. And then you throw it up on Insta. You get a big fat like from old CD69, and you're on your way. - CD? Who's CD69? - Charlie Don 69. It's my screen name. It's been my screen name at every possible email account you could have. I had Charlie 69 at Prodigy, Charlie 69 at AOL, Charlie 69 at Hotmail. I even at Charlie 69 at Apple, and that became at iCloud. And now it's at me, but you have to pay for it, so I don't have it anymore. - Is it funny? I want to be funny. - Yes, it's funny. It's got 69 in the title. I don't know what to tell you. I mean, people think I'm funny. Anyway. Make that meme, Meme Lord. - [Max] And Charlie, I should know. What is 69, so I can- - Nope, whoop. Ba ba ba ba boo. - What's that? Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba boo. Boo boo. - [Max] What? (snoring) - Oh my God. You fucking children of the corned me, man. - [Max] So sorry, Charlie. I just- - You can't do that. - I just, I just came real quick. - Seriously, I think I'm having a heart attack. You can't do that. - Sorry, I just. I just wanted to show you I made the meme. - The what? - The meme. I made the meme, like you said. - Oh, the meme? Yes, the meme. Yes yes, the meme. What I thought my apocalypse outfit would be. What it actually is. - It's not, you're not laughing. It's not funny? - No, no. It's, it's, it's really funny. Sometimes when I read things, I, and they're funny I don't laugh, but like I. You laugh in your mind, you know, like "The New Yorker". - So I should post it? - Post that shit. Yes, you only got one shot. - Thanks, Charlie. - Yeah, while we're in it, shoot that shit, baby. Eight mile, mom's spaghetti. Top of the morning. - Oh my God, you gotta wear clothes today. - What are talking about? I am wearing clothes. This is Egyptian cotton. - I have a Zoom with a girlfriend
