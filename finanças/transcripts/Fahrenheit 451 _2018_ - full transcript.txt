( music playing ) ( man blows ) ( match striking ) Female newscaster: Eels rioted last night in Denver, demanding medicine, travel permits, and full access to the 9. Twelve Eels were arrested and all the graffiti was found and burned. Meanwhile, here in Ohio, a warehouse full of graffiti was found outside of Cleveland, including a rare discovery of pens and paper... - Yuxie, MiPhotos. - Female automated voice: Here ya go, Montag. Your fans are waiting on the 9. Newscaster: Two Firemen were sent to the hospital with minor injuries. Fire Commissioner Nyari released a statement: "Our elected officials will not allow the happiness of our great state to be threatened by evil Eels. Our Firemen will defend our democracy." Yuxie: Great choice. You'll look good in those. Newscaster: And now for the Happiness Index, we go to Arthur Link. ( loud chatter ) ( Firemen shouting encouragement ) - ( onlookers groan ) - You like that? - All: Oh! - ( Montag grunting ) Montag: Ohh! Firemen: Oh! Ohh! - There she blows. - Fireman: Yeah, Captain, yeah! Captain Beatty: When you have a "why" to fight, you can bear almost any "how." I'll give you a "why." You knocked my tooth out. You're too pretty, anyway. Lemme see. Eh. You can keep it that way. Everything you lose comes around in another form. I'll get the doc to print me up another one. Captain Beatty: Eels are bad. They're dangerous, and they want chaos in your hearts and your minds. They want to make you unhappy. Eels try to upload graffiti to the Dark 9 before we can burn it. What should these young Natives do, Master Trooper? Stay vivid on the 9. If you see something, say something. Beatty: Eels say we limit information. Lies! Master Trooper Montag, can you read any book you want on the 9? Sir, any book, sir. Yuxie, show us some classics. The Bible... "To the Lighthouse"... and "Moby Dick." This is all you need to know. Anything else will make you sick, crazy. And that's why we're here. To protect you and to keep you safe and happy. - Understood? - Yes, sir! Please rise. All: Happiness is truth! Freedom is choice! Self is strength! ( all jeering, booing ) Don't worry, don't worry, these are for training purposes only, OK? ( clacking ) Now, have any of you guys ever seen one of these bad things for real? All: No! We burned almost every physical book in the country. So by the time you guys grow up, there won't be one book left. He should probably raise his hands a little higher, right? I might miss. ( scattered laughter ) ( weapon clicking ) ( all cheering ) Whoo! ( siren wails ) - ( siren continues ) - This is not a drill! We've got Eels on the move! Man: We got Eels slipping away! - Move! Move! Move! - Montag: Let's ride! Check all gear! Let's go, let's go! Let's go! This is why we train! Let's burn, let's burn, let's burn!

( indistinct yelling ) - Montag, upstairs! - I got him! - Don't make me chase after you! - Hold him down! Everybody stay right where you are! - ( Montag grunts ) - ( woman squeals ) Hey, drop the cord! ( man grunts, groans ) - ( switchblade clicks ) - Montag: Come on. Yeah. - Aah! Aaah! - Hey. Come on. ( both grunting ) You dream about hiding from me! You better wake up and apologize. Hey, Captain, wanna come get some? Go check the other rooms. Are you done? ( faint clicking ) ( computers humming ) Beatty: What are you waitin' for? Waitin' on you. Raven: Good evening, Cleveland, and welcome to tonight's fire show. Captain Beatty and his Master Trooper Montag have uncovered Eels pretending to be Natives. What punishment would you like to see here tonight? Welcome, Natives, and everybody at home watchin' on the 9. Look what we found hiding in your beautiful neighborhood. - ( booing, jeering ) - ( woman shouting ) Eels don't deserve freedom, now, do they? - All: No! - We won't let 'em take our jobs and steal our tax money, now, will we? Woman: Hell, no! Self is strength! Happiness is truth! Guess what time it is? All: Time to burn for America again! - Come on. - Wait, wait, wait. No, no. No, no. Wait. Stone! Reprint. Yuxie, +10 years. Yuxie: Identity deletion commencing. - ( device humming ) - ( man screaming ) ( man groaning ) Man: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Delete his identity! - ( beeping ) - ( whirring ) - Man 1: Ban his travel. - Man 2: Get that money, too. Enjoy your new life as an Eel. I'm not fire... I'm fire +100. I'm molten lava on graffiti. They call me a walking incinerator for happiness. Damn, it's a pleasure to burn! Everybody watching at home on the 9, are you ready? Man: Burn 'em, Montag! ( people shouting ) Man: Take that, Eels! Take that! ( crowd chattering, cheering ) - ( hums, beeps ) - ( lock clicks ) ( beeps ) Beatty: Hey. You're still high on kerosene, aren't you? I can smell it from here. Let's get goin'. - Montag: Where we headed? - Beatty: A little after-hours trip. You hear from Major Curtis? ( chuckles ) It's happening. End of the year. - Oh! I knew it. - ( Beatty chuckles ) - "Major Beatty." - Yeah. I'm gonna miss your ugly mug around here. Yeah. You'll finally become me. No, no, no. Not become you. I'm gonna be Captain motherfuckin' Montag. ( music playing ) Beatty: There she is. Montag: Don't worry, I'll talk to her this time. Keep your dick in your pants and stand guard. Well, well, well. Clarisse. I hope you're not wasting my time tonight. Your last tip led me to Boy Scouts with pornos. Clarisse: Reactivate my fingers like you said you would. Beatty: Feed me scraps, and I'll delete your travel permit. That's bullshit. You need me. How many years did we restrict you? Six? After all the tips I gave you, I should be free. A beautiful, free rat. Take a year off my sentence, and I'll give you something you like. Six months. But it better be good. I didn't hear the captain say you could leave. ( scoffs ) Yeah? How come he always makes you wait outside like a little dog, huh? You're just like Beatty. I'm not like Beatty. - Everyone has a master. - Not me. You spy on me, but you never do anything. - Why do I always make you nervous? - You don't. When I see you burning up Eel's lives, you don't look nervous. That's because I'm very good at my job. Hmm. Have you ever thought, even for one second, why you do what you do? You should try reading before burning. See you around, Montag. Hey. Off limits. Let's go. She recommended a spot. Man: Captain Beatty, I... I have my permits, sir, - all one hundred. - I can't wait to see 'em. See if you can find me a new pair of shoes. ( hollow sound ) Captain. Well, look what I found. You guys must think you're pretty slick. Beatty: Sit down. Don't move. Have they uploaded to the 9? Nah. Just this monitor. Hit "play." Do it. Let's see what they have to say. Before bots and the rise of automated writing, we had jobs for journalists... ( static )... someday. She'd spend weeks, sometimes months, investigating a story, and then she'd publish a series of articl... ( static )... dreds, even thousands of words long on physical paper and the Internet, or the 9, today, which everyone was free to read. But nobody was reading anymore, or they were just glancing at the headlines generated by an algorithm... Beatty: Thousands of words? Ugh. In your pathetic time, were people happy? No. There were so many millions of opinions that our country slid into the Second Civil War. Eight million dead, including my father. Your father must have been old enough to remember a time when firemen put fires out instead of starting them. - Hey! - Just relax, all right? Beatty: Benjamin Franklin, the founder of our first fire department, gave us the right to burn. Those are lies. Ben Franklin did not do that. After the last of your generation dies, so will your words... your memories... and the burden of your fake past. Female newscaster: Even in their self-hours, Captain Beatty and Master Trooper Montag keep Cleveland safe. Let's give them a +100 salute. Do your part. See something, say something. Tell Yuxie. Meanwhile, Firemen outside of Buffalo, New York, captured Eels attempting to cross the border into Canada. There has been an increase in illegal migration, and local fire stations... Beatty: When you become a captain, you have to know more. You'll get to read more. So you've read entire books. ( grunts ) Yeah, but the Ministry, of course, they have complete works, right? I don't know. I suppose when they make me District Major they'll throw me a few more scraps, but the Ministry's... How can we see anything but the fire shadows in the cave... if we're never allowed to move our heads? What does that mean? Nothin' You're as impatient as I was when I was your age. Yeah. I just wonder how much my dad knew. - He was a great Fireman. - Damn right he was. - And a friend. - Fuckin' Eels. He was a hero. Same as you'll be, Guy Montag! I am a hero. Hmm. I am a hero. ♪ Down the red-hot valley, lo! ♪ ♪ The phantom armies marching go ♪ - There we go! - ♪ Salamander ho! ♪ Salamander ho! ♪ Ignite the tomes... ♪ Beatty: Do things yourself! Keep this sponge alive! Thus endeth tonight's lesson. ♪ Salamander ho! Salamander ho! ♪ Clarisse: It's a DD series. It works. I put in a new belt myself. ( jazz music playing ) What do you have for me? There is an abandoned house out in the woods near Bedford. It's a drop-off spot for graffiti. - Does anyone live there? - No, I don't think so. Montag: Yuxie, Firemen. Did we used to put out fires? Yuxie: That's a classic Eel lie. And Benjamin Franklin. Founder of our first fire department. What's wrong, Montag? Nothin'. Your vitals have been off recently. I'm going to reconfigure your cocktail and have new drops delivered. That's fine. Yuxie: John, have you used your drops today? Yuxie, go dark. I'm secure now. ( beeps twice ) - ( man talking, indistinct ) - ( baby crying ) Woman: Clarisse? Haven't had milk all week. Thanks. Sorry, I couldn't find any cooking oil. - That's OK. - Hey, Clarisse? Be careful what you're selling. People are talking. ( recorded classical piano playing ) ( melting solder hissing ) Yuxie, go dark. I'm secure now, Montag. ( device beeping ) Yuxie: Signal lost. Entering a black hole. Set a transponder so Raven can find us. - ( beep ) - Montag: Transponder set. Did Clarisse tell you about this spot? ( crickets chirping ) ( air brakes hiss ) ( owl hoots ) Douglas. Freeman, check around back. ( floorboards creak ) Stone! - Jove, Kyle, clear this room! - Yes, sir. ( clicks ) Beatty: Montag, get that tumor Eel on her feet. The rest of you search the house. - Now. - Fireman: Yes, sir. How many of you are there? ( snap ) How many? "Grapes of Wrath." Hmm. Get her up. You heard the captain. Up. On your feet. Beatty: How many more of these do you have, Ma Joad? If you can read, you can talk. Play the man, Master Ridley. We shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, as I trust shall never be put out. Fireman: Captain Beatty! You're never gonna believe what we found, sir. You gotta get up here. Phelps, keep eyes on her. This is gonna be the most important burn the country has ever seen, sir. Beatty: Go see if Raven followed the transponder. - But sir... - You just heard the captain. Now move. A regular damn Tower Of Babel. I've only seen something like this once in my career, when I was a cadet. Have you ever seen a physical book before? Hmm. Kafka. A pornographer and a sexual pervert. I like that about him. Have you read that book? Every Fireman sooner or later wants to know... what the Eels know, what's in all this graffiti that we burn. You want to hold it? Go on. Before the men come back. ( whispers ) Open it. Read. Read. Read. Do you want to know what's inside all these books? Insanity. The Eels want to measure their place in the universe, so they turn to these novels about non-existent people. Or worse, philosophers. Look, here's Spinoza. One expert screaming down another expert's throat. "We have free will." "No, all of our actions are predetermined." Each one says the opposite, and a man comes away lost, feeling more... bestial and lonely than before. Now, if you don't want a person unhappy, you don't give them two sides of a question to worry about. - Just give 'em one. - Better yet, none. Ah. See? "Huck Finn"... and his "nigger" friend. The whites knew that you blacks were offended, so what did we do? We burned it. Oh. ( chuckles ) And then "Native Son" came along, and the whites didn't appreciate that one all that much, so they burned it, too. Why didn't they like it? Henry Miller, Hemingway. The feminists don't approve, so into the flames they go. You see, we are not born equal, Guy, so we must be made equal by the fire, and then... we can be happy. So, we burn. Well, let's clear all this filth out of here and... get the fire show started with. Shall we? But take one last look. You may never see anything like this again. Your grandchildren won't even understand what a book is. Woman: Can you tell us anything about what's inside? Nothing that can't burn at 451 degrees. Newscaster: And there you have it... ( books thudding ) Beatty: Montag. Let's get her out of here. Come on. Let's go. Lady, this whole house is gonna get torched. And me, with my books. Let's go. Montag, never mind. Just get over here, please. Captain, we're just gonna leave her? Get over here now. Look, miss, you can do what you like, but you know as well as I do these books are gonna burn. No. Omnis. Omnis. The Ministry has wiped out the word "omnis" from across the 9. This coward is not going to become a martyr before we find out what the hell she's shouting about. Captain Beatty, perhaps you can explain why you let this Eel start a bonfire? We didn't know she had a match, sir, and the kerosene... Major Curtis spoke highly of you. I hope I can come to understand why. After "Beatty's Barbecue," our team reported the word "omnis" appearing in unusually high numbers on the Dark 9. If an Eel is going to blow herself up for it, we need to get ahead of it. Raven: ...the first self-fire in Ohio's history, and only the fourth in the nation. This marks a new low in Eel actions threatening our happiness. Details about this tumor Eel are coming in. She lived alone in the woods, without Yuxie, like a wild animal, and suffered from a +100 mental illness, a result of extreme exposure to reading graffiti. Coward! Raven: We will be updating you as more details come in. Whoa. You all right? Always. Life of a Master Trooper, huh? Beatty: Montag. You hesitated tonight in front of the men. I know. But it won't happen again. You know, it's my first time seeing a self-burn, too. But as far as I'm concerned, it's just proves we're doing the right thing. What was that old lady talkin' about? "Master Ridley, play th..." Somethin'. Well, back when people still believed in gods, the Brits burned alive two Eels at the stake, Ridley and Latimer, for praying to a different book than their queen did. Before us, people committed genocides over books, while others blew themselves up killing innocent people. Insanity +100. But why did she burn herself for books? Well, she tried to burn us all, don't you think? She didn't say "coward." She said "omnis." What is that? Well, the commissioner won't say what the Ministry knows, but I guess we're gonna have to find out. Burn me. - John. - Go ahead. Hurry up. I won't ask twice. ( lighter clicks ) I know you're different than the other men. I watched you grow up, and that's how I know you feel the same inside as me. Closer. I've been burned so many times I don't know where my scars end and my body begins. ( sizzling ) ( grunts ) There's no way you're gonna break. You're the youngest cadet I ever accepted into the Youth Fire Brigade. I raised you. And one day you'll be just like me, son. You won't feel anything when they burn you. ( closes lighter ) Yuxie, go dark, please. Yuxie: I'm secure now, Montag. "I am a sick man. I am a wicked man. An unattractive man. I think my liver hurts." "I agree that 'two times two is four' is an excellent thing. But 'two times two is five' is something also a most charming little thing." - Yuxie: False. - Yuxie, I said go dark. We are dark. It's just me and you. But that is false. Two times two can only be four. What are you doing, Montag? Are you feeling OK? Where are you going? ( sensor chimes ) Man: I don't think that old woman killed herself. I think they staged it. It's all fake. Didn't even bother to sync her lips this time. You saw that shit, right? Yeah, they definitely murdered her. Why do you keep pounding away at it? Hey. Are you good? Clarisse, you know what we're working on. We need someone with your connections. So you tell me when you're ready to come back to us. - See you later. - Be safe. ( dogs barking in distance ) - What are you? What do you want? - Hey! Did Beatty send you? - No, I just came to talk. - What do you want? I want to know who that old woman was. I don't know. She lit herself on fire... for books. - Why? - What do you care? Because I can still smell her burning. - You did that. - And you told us exactly where to find her. She didn't say "coward." She said "omnis." What is that? I don't know. I just want to show you something. I took it from her house. Is this a trap, pipeman? If anybody sees me with this... I'm dead. ( keys jingling ) ( lock clicks ) Hey, Clarisse. Yeah? ( voice in hallway, indistinct ) She didn't see who you were. I shouldn't be here. Then leave. ( locks click ) Please don't do that. ( inhales deeply ) Can you read that out loud? Please? "Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then, he will invent destruction and chaos. He will invent all kinds of suffering out of ingratitude simply to convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key. Hard to understand, right? The Ministry has been wiping away language in order to wipe away thought. There used to be 6,000 languages in the world. Today there are fewer than 60. Why do you think the Ministry wants to create one universal language on the 9? For the connection and happiness of... all Natives. During the Second Civil War, the old tech companies, they built systems to predict our thoughts. Then they became the Ministry, or the Ministry joined them. And they sold us what we wanted, self and happiness, which the 9 provides in spades and what we hired you to defend... with fire. You're telling me people wanted it this way. The Ministry didn't do this to us. We did it to ourselves. We demanded a world like this. Let me ask you somethin'. Benjamin Franklin... did he start the first fire department? Yeah, but to put fires out, not to start them. - Beatty told me the opposite. - I know exactly what Beatty told you. Maybe he believes that; maybe he's lying to you. Maybe when Beatty was young, he let his fire captain lie to him. Do you have trouble with memory? Take a lot of drops? What about you? Can you remember your past? Some. Are you hungry? I don't have much. How 'bout your parents? Can you remember them? I was raised by Eels to be an Eel, pretending to be a Native. We read books, watched films... everything you burn. By the time I was a teen, I wanted to be normal, like you. So I ran away from home, got hooked on the 9, the drops... everything. I was happy for a while. Then, you know, life. Men. I was broke, so I started selling graffiti. Didn't know that old woman would be there. I had never thought about the people behind the things that I burn. I mean, they must have spent their entire life making things. And here I come, in two seconds... it's gone. I want to show you something. ( playing harmonica ) ( continues playing ) Try. Come on. Like this? - ( blows loud note ) - ( both chuckle ) - ( plays softly ) - Here. Put this one here on top. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Try it. ( plays note with slight vibrato ) ( continues playing ) All the details surrounding the Omnis are classified, but the Ministry will include the public to help smoke it out. The danger is real and immediate. Washington's watching us, boys. I want your cities to burn so hot the commander in chief can roast marshmallows all the way from the White House. Make it rain kerosene. ( rain pattering ) Beatty: DNA. The genetic information found inside all living organisms. The Eels have converted the language of technology into the the language of DNA. They've figured out a way to insert enough graffiti into this microscopic speck of DNA to bury the earth ten times over. The Omnis is the collective consciousness of mankind. It will be every book, painting, music, film, all of history, everything on the savages' internet of old... news, memoirs, facts... it will be a trillion person-years of graffiti... all inside this microscopic strand of DNA. Now, the Ministry believes it is here in Ohio, and in transit to scientists in Canada. We have to find it before it crosses the border. Captain, if they succeed... how will we stop it? If the Omnis is unleashed, there will be no way to stop it. All of humanity's chaotic knowledge will burst forth like mosquitoes spreading malaria... and the dark countries will take over. Even the greatest army of Firemen will seem like spitting babies before the Omnis. And everything our parents, our grandparents, sacrificed in the Second Civil War will be lost. We will not let that happen. We will burn down the city tonight, gentlemen! - Salamander! - All: Ho! - Salamander! - Ho! Montag: Eels on the move! Eels on the move! This is why we burn! Beatty: If any of you know where the Omnis is and don't talk, your lives will be burned! ( dogs barking, snarling ) Raven: Breaking news. There is a new threat to our nation's happiness... the Omnis. The Ministry has not revealed details, but fire divisions across Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, are conducting raids, searching for this new evil. Fireman: Get him! Get him! Omnis! What's that mean to you? Huh? What's that mean to you?! Beatty: You're not doing yourselves any favors. Tell me where the Omnis is! Eel: Death to fire! Real liberty unite! - Come here! - ( man groans ) Fireman: Slippery little Eel. In the truck! Beatty: They try to say there's no evidence danger exists. Well, then show me the evidence danger doesn't exist. The truth is, this danger is real, the threat is real. Omnis is real. Eel: Death to fire! ( device whirring ) Clarisse: "To be sure, I myself just made up all these words of yours; this, too, is from underground. I've spent forty years on end there listening to these words of yours through a crack. I thought them up myself since this was all that would get thought up." Beatty: I will have you down on this street before the night is over! Consequences of silence will be severe! Help yourselves and your neighbors by telling us what you know! Not tomorrow, not the next day, but now! Montag: "At least I myself have only recently resolved to recall some of my former adventures, which, till now, I have always avoided. Can it be that you are indeed so gullible to imagine I will publish this all? And, what's more, give it to you to read?" - ( man groaning ) - ( bottle shatters ) ( panting ) Montag: "Now I want precisely to make a test. Is it possible to... to per... Is it possible to be perfectly candid with oneself and not be afraid... of the whole truth?" ( rain pattering ) Beatty: One of you Eels must know something about the Omnis. ( whispering ) What if I tell these people what you do? What would be worse... what I do to you, or what they do to you? Man: We're all the same here. Whatever you do to her, you do to us. Is that so? Fair enough. ( clatter ) - Ohh! - ( body hits ground ) I am your judge, and I am your court. I receive you when you come, - and I... - Ohh! dismiss you when you go! - Beatty: Round 'em up! - Fireman: Get over here. Round 'em up. Over there! - Round 'em up. - ( all shouting ) Come on. Come here. ( Firemen shouting at Eels ) Newscaster: The Ministry has placed the nation in a +100 state of security until the Omnis is found. Youth Cadets have been recruited to patrol borders and search all transit hubs. Do your duty. Stay vivid on the 9 and report all suspicious activity. - Montag: What are you doing? - I have to get out of here. Where you gonna go? There are people hiding out at a compound my family used to know. Maybe I can help them. They got checkpoints all over the place. You think you can make it? I have a friend who knows where they are. I think he can help me. Will I see you again? Fireman: Keep searching for that Omnis! - Montag: Get 'em out of here! - Fireman: Yes, sir. All clear. Let's check upstairs. - ( clatter ) - Man: Shh! ( opens door, pulls back curtain ) ( rain pattering ) Beatty: And how would you explain your behavior today? I fucked up. - I couldn't tell you why. - Was it the kid? Eels use kids as decoys all the time. No excuse. I know my actions put you and the men in danger. What if they had had the Omnis? Captain Beatty... sir, it's been a true honor. But... I respectfully ask that you accept my resignation. Get that off my desk. I'm sorry, John. Do it. Now. Are you serious? I just submitted your name to replace me as captain. - It's not about that. - Oh. So you're willing to throw away the sixteen years that I've invested in you. I have sixteen years of the Ministry's shit in my head. And I want to know why we burn. - I want to decide. - Ah. - So you want to prove you exist. - Yeah, I do. I got things inside my head that don't make sense. Dreams about my dad. Look, as your commanding officer, it is my duty to report you for letting two Eels go free today. And if I do that, you will be tried for treason. And there will be nothing I can do to protect you. You betray me... and I will burn you. And then I will burn your ashes. Dreams are a terror, son. I know. But it's just your mind flingin' itself to pieces. Just stand back from the centrifuge, OK? You have a virus. Go home... and rest. Take a hot bath. And then you report to work tomorrow. But don't make me come get you. ( clears throat ) Reactivate. Yuxie: Hello, John. Yuxie, get me Fireman Douglas. Raven: Do your part. See something, say something. Tell Yuxie. Together, we will keep Cleveland... ( tires squeal ) Montag. Get in. - How'd you find me? - My friend Gustav... I'm no friend of his. Don't look at me. - Don't fuckin' look at me! - What's wrong with you?! You deleted my brother's life, man! And you gave him 25 years! You're scum! Clarisse: That's enough. Gustavo: You better be right about him. Where we goin'? To those people at the compound I told you about. - They want to see you. - For what? - Something about the Omnis. - Gustavo: Do it, or I will. You have to put this on. Who else was with 'em? Douglas: I don't know, sir. Axix-Cam picked up Clarisse. I knew Montag was a rat. I told you he wasn't pure. I didn't ask your opinion! And the next time I tell you to follow someone, you crawl into their asshole! You hear me?! Report back to the station. Yes, sir. Yuxie: This is a problem, John. Clarisse told us you stole this. But when I see you sitting there, all I can see is fire. You must be burning all these books, and us, in your mind. Because you are what you are, and perhaps, that's all you'll ever be... fire. This man is just like his Commandant Beatty. He's not to be trusted. Why did you burn books your whole life? Because that's all I know. Deze man is een stuk stront. But I want to do something else. Why? When I look at that book, it made me remember when I was a kid. Just sittin' by the ocean... and I was trying to fill this sieve with sand. But the faster I poured, the faster the sand fell through it. Lookin' at the words in that book, I felt like they... they were passing right through me. Like my whole life just... passed right through me. And that I missed it. I'm not gonna let that happen again. Books are here to remind us what fools we can be. But if we can remember, if the Omnis can spread, then maybe we will win. The disconnected human mind is the last bastion against the technological world. It's the most secure place to preserve these books. We're totally off the grid. No computers, no way for you to Firemen to track us or enter our dreams. Everything safely here. - You memorized all these books? - We each memorize one, and then we become the book. I am Toni Morrison. "Song of Solomon." He's "The Letters of Van Gogh." She's Chairman Mao, "The Little Red Book." She's Rumi, Darwin, "Anna Karenina." And she's half of "A Yellow Sun." She's still memorizing it. In fact, you've met one of us already. You took this book from her library. She was John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath"... now lost to humanity forever. But maybe from her death we will gain something. We haven't seen Clarisse since she was a teen when she was here with her parents. I believe you were memorizing "White Teeth." And she tells us you want to help. We have an important task for you related to the Omnis. But we have to be sure about you. Do you know this man? Fireman Hester. Fourth District. That's right. He's in the back room, waiting for you. And you're gonna have to kill him. Clarisse: You never told me that. He's through that door. A revolution is not a dinner party. Good luck. ( door opens, closes ) ( switchblade clicks ) ( clicks ) ( whispers ) They need you, they need you. Stop! Put it down! Hey, man, what the fuck is this? You did it. It's over. I'm James Baldwin. "The Fire Next Time." Welcome. ( leaves rustling ) This way, please. There's a young man, Clifford, in this barn, in transit to a group of scientists in Canada, and we need you to escort him over the border. His mother was a geneticist behind the Omnis. Before she died, she injected the DNA into Clifford's pet bird. - The Omnis is in a bird? - Yes. We need you to get them both to safety. Woman: Clifford? There's a man here to see you. Clifford: Eight. Tagore, Gitanjali, and poems by Tagore. It's number eight. Clarisse: Has he read all these books? He's memorized over 13,000 books. Clifford: Pick up a book and test me. I won't look. But you'll never win. Read the title. - "Remembrance of Things..." - Remembrance of Things Past." Marcel Proust, 1927. 3,031 pages, seven volumes, 1,267,069 words. Open it. Open it. Page number... I'll turn around. No cheating. Page number? - Page 935. - 935. Line 12. Go to line 12. "So, as long as you distract your mind from its dreams, it will not know them for what they are. You will always be taken in by the appearance of things, because you will not have grasped their true nature. If dreaming is dangerous, then the cure for it is not to dream less, but to dream more, to dream all the time." Again, test... test me again. You'll lose. Oh, can I show him Lennie? - Can I? - Yes. ( chuckling ) Hey. This is Lennie. My sturnidae, from the Latin sturnus. Medium-sized passerine. Very gregarious. Very beautiful. This is my Lennie. ( bird tweets ) What's up, Lennie? ( chirping ) Montag: So, what's the next step? We need a transponder. The scientists in Canada are transmitting a homing signal that will call to a transponder. Can you get one and come back tonight? Yes. What are they gonna do with the bird? They're waiting to extract the DNA with the Omnis, duplicate it, and then inject all other animals so that knowledge can spread and multiply. And cover the world. You'd better hurry. ( gasps ) ( panting ) ( alarm wailing ) - ( beeps ) - ( lock clicks ) ( beeps ) ( beeping ) Beatty: Master Trooper. I wasn't expecting to see you. - Are you over your sickness? - Yeah. You were right. I just needed to rest. - I'm feelin' 100 now. - Beautiful. - So you're with us. - Yes, sir. We need to find the Omnis. Any leads? Yuxie, have Fireman Douglas and his squad report. Raid time. I'm ready to gear up. What does two times two equal? Excuse me? Four. Why? What's wrong? Is that all you have to say to me? Of course. John, just talk to me. What's goin' on? I, too, burn with desire. But I would rather walk with my brother in the darkness than go alone in the light. - Sir. - Whatever happens tonight, Guy, you should know I would rather walk with my brother. ( footsteps approach ) Douglas, report, please. Found this in the locker room, sir. Beatty: Whose locker did you find it in? Nobody's. It was just on the floor. Like a dead rat. Take it! That's an order. Go on. Read us a bedtime story. - ( lighter clicks ) - Let's burn this shit. No, no, no, no, no, no. A special tip came directly to me tonight. Might be a good lead on the Omnis. But let's finish this little business first. Open the book. Oh, my. Your pulse is really racing. Steady now, Montag. I wouldn't want to burn your hand off. Now read. Read to me. "To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's. Taking a new step, uttering a new word... ( snaps lighter shut ) ...is what people fear the most." All those silly words, those false promises, the timeworn philosophies. It's like chain-smoking, chapter by chapter. - Go on. Don't stop reading to me. - Sir. Next page! "Did you think that one tiny crime... ( lighter clicks ) ...would be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? That there would be no punishment?" A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You read a few lines, and you're ready to blow up the world, chop heads off, destroy authority. I know. I've been through it all. Now, what do you want to do? I want to burn. Hmm. Montag. My brother. Let's burn. Raven: Good evening, Cleveland. Live outside Master Trooper Montag's home where shocking events are unfolding. Montag! Do you have anything to say to your fans? Montag. Something the matter, Montag? You wanted to fly near the sun. You burn your damn wings off and you wonder why. Go in. I'll give you a minute to get your house in order. Go on. No one is lookin' out for you now, boy. Yuxie: Hello, Montag. This is rather unfortunate. Some people would like to see you. That's quite a collection of graffiti you have there. Your fans deserve an explanation. These aren't mine. You set me up! ( footsteps approach ) Welcome, John. I've been waiting for you. Yuxie, go dark. I told you I would burn you if you betrayed me. And this... this is the big dance. Douglas. Stone. Yuxie! Let the fire show begin. Now, you do what you are trained to do. All you know how to do. Burn. ( panting ) You're not finished. Go on. ( panting ) Free yourself. Let's light him up. Tell your fans what time it is. All: It's time to burn for America again! Say it, Montag. - ( crowd jeering ) - Say it! Woman: Spit it out! Come on! Come on, Captain. Why did you do this? - What did you find? Chaos. - ( clamp clicks ) ( device humming ) The Salamander eats its own tail. Master Trooper Douglas. Master Trooper Douglas reporting, sir. - Tell us what you saw. - Montag getting into a car with Clarisse McClellan and two known Eels. Beatty: No wonder you've been so eloquent lately. But you're still the same dog I raised, just barking at someone else's command. Gather a squad, find Clarisse and the other Eels - and bring them to me. - Yes, sir. - Montag! Stop! Let it go! Drop it! - Montag: Drop it, Douglas! Well, that's one way to win your fans back. Beatty: Hold fire till your brother speaks. - Drop it, Douglas. - Beatty: Go ahead, pull the trigger, let Douglas have it. - Captain. - Quiet, Douglas! Could it be existence is our exile and nothingness is our home? Fire is your home, Montag. - Burn away. - No, Captain, please! What is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying. ( screaming ) ( Douglas continues screaming ) Montag, you did it. You did it. ( panting ) Choice. ( onlookers scream ) Beatty: Dear Natives. Eel Montag, murderer Montag, terrorist Montag, has committed treason against our nation. Eyes on Axis-Cam, eyes on the 9, and report where this terrorist is. Terrorist Montag... could he have the Omnis? Stay vivid to find out. - Montag: Where's Gustavo? - Clarisse: They arrested him. Transponder? ( beeps ) - Page 93. - 93. "I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love. If you want me again, look for me under your boot soles. You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, but I shall be good help to you nevertheless, and filter and fiber your blood. Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged. Missing me one place, search another. I stop somewhere, waiting for you." Yuxie: Found him. He's heading to this black hole outside Talay City. Rerouting for fastest arrival. ( engine revving ) - ( vehicles approach ) - Clifford, run! - ( panicked shouting ) - Clifford! ( air brakes hiss ) ( all shouting ) ( Firemen shouting at Eels ) Male Eel: Get out of here! Run! Run! - Toni! - Fireman: Don't you move! - Get down! - Get off of her! Come on. Get up, we gotta go. Come on. - ( flames whoosh ) - Fireman: Stand still! Fireman: When I ask you not to move, that means don't move! ( fire whooshing ) Hey. Clifford. Hey. Come on. ( bird chirps ) ( transponder beeps ) ( chirping) ( chirping ) Omnis? Stop. I command you, Montag. Stop. ( chirping ) ( wings flapping ) ( music playing, no audible scream ) ( wings flapping ) ( music playing ) ( music playing )
