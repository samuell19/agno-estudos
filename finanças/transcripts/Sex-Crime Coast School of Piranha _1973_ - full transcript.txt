Do you need anything? Ks, I want to borrow your boat over there. Give us a ride. What? I can only give you a ride. Are you kidding me? Do you think I'd let you enjoy time with my woman? I'm sure your old man bought it with dubious money. How dare you say that to me? Only poor dudes would say such a thing. If you are threatening me, there will be consequences. Let's go! Somebody! Somebody help! Somebody! Miss! The police is here. Come in. Thank; We are on patrol right now. Many vacation homes have been broken into recently. Please lock up properly at night. And if you see someone suspicious, contact us immediately. - See you. - Thank you for your service. Hey! They're here. Don't. Don't! Do it. We are going to watch. Do it now! No! No! Stop! Stop! Please stop! Stop! Please stop! Please! Please stop! Shinji! Won't you follow her? Hey! Wait! Who's that woman? She's been following us. I think she'll report us to the police. The police? I'm not interested in any police business. Liar! Why are you here then? I just wanted to know about the Piranha. Leave. If you come near us, we'll chew you up and kill you! Because you are Piranha? Do her! Hello? Please wait just a moment. Miss, it's Mr. Ogiwara. Hello. Please talk. Hironobu? This is Tomiko. From the train station right now? I'm not sure taxies are available. Please do. Everybody is waiting. Ks. Thanks. Hasn't Kyoko come home yet? No, she told me that she would see her beautician. She must be putting on some makeup before meeting her fiance. But isn't it too late? You don't need to worry. She will be home soon. She knows Hironobu is coming for dinner. So, is Kyoko really going to marry him? It's fine with me! Do you have a problem with it after all this time? Your business will go well. How is the loan going? I only need his father's approval. I feel some hesitation from him though. Politicians don't trust people. Apparently, he has already been thoroughly checking my background. My family, monetary assets and so on. Why bother? After that, you will earn a lot anyway. It's worth it. It's Ogiwara. Welcome! - Take his bag to the room. - ks, ma'am. Follow me. Ah, Ogiwara! I've been waiting for you. Thank you for letting me stay. My father told me to give you his regards. My pleasure. - Come, come. - ks. - Please. - ks. How is your father doing? He is busy campaigning right now. Actually, I wanted to follow him. really? Sorry about that. It's okay. It's not that I'm all that excited about those activities. Kyoko is sure to love it too. Have a relaxing time in the fresh air. Ks. Thank you very much. By the way, I heard something. I've heard rumors about crimes in this neighborhood. About that... Some group called Piranha or Hiranha has robbed many vacation homes. None of the victims have reported it to the police. They are exploiting that. Apparently, many women have become their prey. But our house is fine. As you can see, we are protecting it properly. - I put your clothes here. - Yes. I've wanted to see you. Ah, she is back. Welcome back. Ogiwara is here. He is taking a shower right now. I see. What's up? It's quite late. Ogiwara is waiting for you. Fathers are like piranhas. You devour others without shame. What's that supposed to mean? Does it sound weird? - Kyoko! Hi! - Welcome. I don't understand what young women think about nowadays. Ogiwara, are you sure you won't regret marrying her? I'm fine because I can inherit Nambu Family by marrying her. She is such a high-class girl. By the way, it looks secure. Shit! It's so secure not even an ant could get in there. But they don't have a dog. How do we get in then? Shinji will take care of it. Good Evening! Is he okay? I brought him a big bottle of sake. He will fall asleep and dream about money until morning. Things have gone well. If you marry Kyoko, we can live under the same roof without any disturbances. You know Kyoko is a Nanbu girl, don't you? Hey, Shinji! Let's break into that house. How do we get in? If we touch the gate. the alarm will go off. The rooms are equipped with electric bars. We're going to get electrocuted. That makes me want to do it even more. I want to fuck her too. We will do it soon. When? Shinji! The girl from the other day. - Where are you going? - Wait here. It scares me. Good morning. What a nice boat! Would you give me a ride too? Who are you? lam no one. You are disturbing us. Go away. I doubt you can drive this boat the way you're handling it. You are rude. It's none of your business. It is. The sea is my territory. I have never seen you before. Hey, stop behaving like a yakuza. Huh? Do I look like a yakuza? I will call the police! Interesting. Go ahead. Ogiwara, don't waste energy on this guy. Let's go. Wait! What is he doing? I don't know. What? Marubushi is likely to win? No way! What am I doing with his son then? Okay! Come here with the documents by 10 in the morning tomorrow! What's wrong? Trouble at work? He says Marubushi is likely to win. Are you saying you won't have any money now? You promised me my own shop. Don't break your promise! Don't worry. I have tried hard to sneak around your wife. Isn't that right?! I know. I will officially make you my wife one day. Really? I'm so happy! Shinji... How can we get past the gate? It's doable. The gate only gets activated by the residents' voices. Once I crack the device, everything else is easy. Let's go. This is Tomiko. This is Tomiko. Huh? What happened? A power outage? Do we have candles? Let me have that for a sec. Miss? Oh, thank you. The power will be back on soon. Candle light is romantic, isn't it? Here you are. Ma'am! Only our house is without power! really? That's strange. It must be a problem with the fuse. Let me check. - Thanks. - No problem. Weird. It's not a fuse problem. Let's check the phone line. I think you have to call Kanto Electric to do the repair. - Here. - ks. The phone doesn't work either. That's weird. What are they doing? Let's call the police! The phone is dead! - We can't run away. - Let's hide. Huff! _ 'h' _ Omar: Hide now. No! Let me go! Don't do this! I will do whatever you tell me to do! Please don't kill me! You're such a coward. Watch carefully. That hurts! Please be more gentle! She is corrupted. She likes men. Hey, look! Let's call the police, ma'am! Wait! The police can't help us! We'd have to relive the embarrassment without actually catching them! But if we don't... Sorry, Ogiwara! We should live with it! If your father ever finds out about this... I didn't do anything wrong! Why should I live with these terrible memories? Forget about it! I will pretend that I haven't seen anything. You're right. It is not wise to rile up those crazies. They deserve it! Those snobby women wailed like bitches! She was fine. I wanted to keep fucking her. Me too! It's just that my dick wouldn't get hard again. The memories will torment them forever. People say that getting raped is more exciting. They are corrupted people! People say that snobby women secretly prefer it rough. Shinji doesn't look okay. He was the only one who didn't do anything. Right. He's only interested in me. Huh? How sweet! - Go ahead and drink! - Yeah. Why are you here? Why are you here? Because I've wanted to see your face. Why did you do such a thing? There is nothing else I want to do. How about you? Do you think every human being is alone? You can call the police on me... What happened to them? They followed you to the vacation home. Idiots! We have a rule that we don't go to the same house twice! We were worried. You made the rule, but we thought you would break it. Shinji! - Shinji! - Don't move! If you move an inch, I will shoot you! Killing these idiots is self-defense! Mr. Nanbu! Please let me kill them! The three of you! Raise your hands and look at me! Why did you come back? What does it take to satisfy you? I want to fuck you one more time. Animals! It's fun to watch! Hey, everyone! I love this house. Let's lock them up and live here for a while! OK. Nobody will come. And we have plenty of food, of course. Shinji! Do you agree? It looks better now. The crazy residents might like steel bars, but I don't. Every piece is expensive. How disrespectful! - Finally, it looks like our place. - Yeah! Shinji! Come! Will this do? Ogiwara! In an hour, an employee of mine will come. That's our chance. We have to wait until then. Okay. What's HP? Would you let me go to the toilet? She's interesting. I will guide you. Hey, Ken! Don't you think Shinji is weird? Huh? He must be attracted that girl Kyoko. No way. 'Ks. I'm sure of it. Are you jealous? We can't trust Shinji anymore. My employee will arrive soon. Okay. Hey! Hey! President! Piranha are inside! Catch them! Don't move! If you move, I will shoot! Don't fucking move! Shoot if you can. Hey! You bastard! Release him! Otherwise, I will shoot this guy! Stop. Please! I will give you money and won't report this to the police! Please! It's too late to cry! Mr. Nanbu! Please tell him to release me. Ken! Don't shoot! Don't! Shut up! I won't take your orders anymore! Wait! Shinji, you idiot! Idiot! The End
