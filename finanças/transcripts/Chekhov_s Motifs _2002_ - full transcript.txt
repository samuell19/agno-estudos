Right now we'll go to the cemetery, you and I. You've gone mad again. What are we going to do there? Please, let's go! Please! You have to go home with your bride, madman! I don't give a damn about all that! A thousand curses! I'm going for a funeral service. Yes, I've gone mad. I nearly died. Oh, Kotelnikov! I saw her, saw, saw, saw her! She's at the cemetery. I need a rest, a change of scenery. Are you going to rest at the cemetery? What? I'm saying she's dead. Dead! I was at the funeral. I was gone. That's why all those doubts. I was on tour. She's no more? Where is she? I was on tour. Where's she? I feel nervous without her. There's some anxiety, terrible and yet incomprehensibly beautiful and precious for me. Kiss your wife. Are we going? Come on! Died-shmied - doesn't matter, as long as you're healthy. Oh, how wondrous is the blossom of spring! Quietly flows the day's radiance. The world is once more discovered. Far, faraway we'll be taken by spring When suddenly, amid silence, From the window it would sing. So many people! Shouting, making noise, groaning. Yes, an expensive wedding. They live well. But for nothing. - What? - This wedding. Every day we marry, we christen, we bury, and all for nothing. Well, what do you expect? Nothing. All for nothing. Singing and burning incense and reciting. But God doesn't hear. I've been serving here 40 years and God hasn't heard once. All for nothing! Too much philosophizing spins the head. Today we buried someone, now a wedding, tomorrow a christening, and no end in sight. And who needs all this? No one. It's all for nothing. What do they call a dowry nowadays? By what term? Why change such a precise word? - I think he got a good dowry. - Of course. That's our life. Once I was engaged too, then married, and I took the so-called dowry. But all is forgotten in the merry-go-round of time. Yes. Well, Father Nikolai? - I thought you'd left, Father Nikolai. - Not yet. - And you, Father lvan. - No. Thought you had. Let's go and have some tea. No, thank you, Father Archpriest. I have to write a report. Well, you know best. By the way, Father Nikolai, you didn't give me the book to read from in time, and didn't open it, and mixed up the prayer twice. Forgive me, please. Any good news about a new shower? Will we get one? Yes, you'll get everything. Lucky you remembered, or we'd have gone. Isn't it working? Oh God, what is it?! - What's wrong? - What is it? Who is it? Let me go! Come on, let me go! Why are you rushing so? I'm a friend of Tatiana Repina. I poisoned myself... Out of hate. Save me! I... He offended... It hurts so much... Why is he happy? Oh, Lord! Save me! From hate, everybody should poison themselves! She's in a grave, and he... He offended God in a woman! A woman died! Save me! Where are they? Where's the groom? Where's the bride? Locked me in! Where's the wedding? - Aren't you ashamed, Marisha? - I'm not ashamed, daddy! Locked me in! Animals! Cunning bitches! Leave me alone! Go! Go! We need to call a doctor. - Where's the groom? And the wedding? - Aren't you ashamed, Marisha? I'm not ashamed, daddy! Locked me in! Cunning bitches! Go! Leave me alone! Go. Go. Go! It's a PR for you, daddy You're like my sister. I'm not like anyone. Not in looks. She... She's 13 and tubby. She's a terrorist, an over-thrower, just like you. Do you live here or in town? I haven't got a telephone. I'm off home then. Mom! What? Nothing. Hi. Oh, the elder son's come back! Rain's coming again. So, you've changed your mind about leaving today? I'm very sorry about everything. My fault. Forgive me. Children, time for bed! Go, make beds. Must go and make beds. Everything's fine. Fine. Children, time for bed! Children, time for bed! But so long as we started talking about all this... So long as we started talking about all this... Listen, we need to have a serious talk. Yes, a serious talk. I've always respected you and never dared to talk to you this way. But your behavior, your last act... We never sit at the table without you kicking up a fuss. Your bread sticks in our throats. There's nothing more offensive, more humiliating than begrudging a crust of bread. Yes, you're a father, but nobody, neither God nor nature, gave you the right to so cruelly offend and take your mood out on weaker people. You've tormented and worn mother out, my sister is hopelessly downtrodden, and I... and I... It's not your business to teach me! No. It's my business! Mine! You can humiliate me as much as you want, but please, leave mother in peace! I won't allow you to torment mother! You're spoiled, spoiled, because nobody has dared stand up to you. They've trembled before you, gone mute, but that's finished! You're a crude, ill-mannered man! You're crude, see? Crude, heavy, indifferent. You're crude, you see? And it's ridiculous to blame time! Saying the times are hard! The times are always the same! The times are always hard! All people are different! And nobody can stand you! They can! Silence! Alright! You don't like to hear the truth? Great! Alright! Start shouting! Great! Throw things! Throw them! You have no idea how to do it? I'll show you! A one, and a two! Can't see? Come closer! A one! And a two! And again! It's your fault! You brought him up this way! I don't wish to live in this house anymore! I don't want to live with you anymore! You hear?! - What, your dad sent you money? - He did! Alright, goodbye. Everything will be fine. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye! - Goodbye, write to us! Go away, if you're leaving. Unlucky with the weather. Goodbye, I'm going. Goodbye. The money's on the round table.
