Callisto station this is control Everybody back here sends their congratulations and their deepest appreciation for the work you doing out there As humanity steps out to the stars we'll be walking on the path that you're forging You should both be proud Control this is mission specialist Elizabeth Henstridge - Callisto station our last messages must've crossed out there somewhere I assume you received my last transmission I took Mark I disposed of the body of Commander Mark Ellsworth I moved his body out of the station onto the moon's surface given the temperature his body will remain frozen and intact until the crew of LVC 211 can get here to relieve us me Until that time I will continue with the responsibilities of the expedition to the best of my abilities Good morning control Uhh, attaching the latest data from the rovers You can see the surface in core temperature variations are within expected Sorry about that this engineering stuffs gonna take some getting used to but expected norms looks like... you tell me Rover Charlie Alpha commenced drill down yesterday afternoon and has reached a depth of approximately 40 kilometers Beta Tango should reach its destination tomorrow afternoon Uh, tomorrow I'll begin system cross-check Callisto this is Mission Control We received your last transmission if If you've not already please forward latest compiled analysis and telemetry from surface rovers. Yea, I'm working on it alright In addition In case you haven't noticed, I'm doing two jobs on IO due to combination of jovian tidal heating and oribital resonance Should be quite a show Uh, Callisto operations is not entirely comfortable with your decision to move Commander Ellsworth body to the surface the danger of contamination... What the fuck was I supposed to do? Let him rot in here? well we run the risk of not being able to differentiate between you Control this is Callisto Last transmission received I appreciate the concerns of operations but they're not here we have no cold storage and no way to prevent decomposition I'm not an idiot I didn't dump him in the ocean the surface is sterile there's no risk The hell was I supposed to do? nobody planned for him to die nobody planned for me to be up here alone two months and 11 days that's how long it's gonna take LVC 211 to get here Not that I'm counting I'll be here alone for 2 months and 11 days What if I can't do it? What if I get injured or sick like mark? I know it's selfish he's dead and I'm here but I can't help thinking about it I'm alone 600 million miles It takes two hours just to say good morning to you guys that's pretty fucking alone What if something happens? I couldn't even save mark I put him outside Oh my god I put him outside in the cold all alone I'm sorry I'm sorry Mark Callisto this is control don't worry about operations their just doing their job We've investigated...erm continuing to investigate ways to speed up the arrival the replacement crew but as you know physics is a harsh mistress we had a word with the docs Elizabeth they say what you're experiencing is... I don't want to say normal but maybe not unexpected survivor's guilt he died you didn't and they tell me isolation psychosis isn't a real diagnosis but they've never been alone in a tin can for months have they? I'm sorry Elizabeth Sorry that you're up there all alone but you're a scientist remember your training focus on the job stay strong we're coming control out Control? Control, something knocked something knocked on the fucking door Oh God What if it's Mark? What if it's Mark. He's alive and he's out there. I put him out there and he wasn't dead and he's trying to get in Jesus, what are you doing? You'll de-pressurize the whole station and kill yourself Mark! He's dead He's dead. Don't be an idiot Elizabeth you saw him die. It's 200 degrees below zero out there if he wasn't dead before he is now oh shit Um Control this is Callisto having a real bad day isolation psychosis that sounds about right control I have to ask are you sure I'm alone up here? Beta Tango on track and speed nominal when it reaches the Delang escarpment I'll undertake manual control permission parameters to ensure real-time response to possible obstructions and landscape anomalies control I'm noticing some fluctuations in the energy output of reactor 2 I'm gonna I'm gonna shift the load to the coil array and run a clean sweep A clean sweep Goddammit! Please tell me you're hearing that. Tell me I'm not going crazy Shut up! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Control...control there's something here What do I do? We shouldn't have come here This is control - acknowledge that we're hearing what you're hearing Open the airlock What? Open the airlock Elizabeth I don't understand Open the door but I'll die Put on your suit and open the door There's something out there Is there? You weren't afraid to put Mark out here? He's dead Is he? What if you made a mistake Elizabeth? Locked me out there all alone No No you were dead - I checked I used all the instruments I measured... the body it's still there who are you? Who's there? Elizabeth this is control - acknowledge no you're not it's happening Elizabeth this is control acknowledge You're lying you're not control Elizabeth this is control acknowledge Elizabeth please acknowledge you're not real this isn't really happening Why would you say that Elizabeth? because you can't be talking to me because it takes a signal 63 minutes to get from here to earth and 63 minutes for one to come back two hours just to say good morning this isn't real it's just my imagination Grief Isolation It's not real Elizabeth Oh god, oh god Doors aren't the only way in Elizabeth isolation psychosis isolation psychosis You're right You shouldn't have come here Turn around No No you can't make me...you can't make me look Look at me Elizabeth Look at me No Please no Control? Ahhh! Callisto this is control Good news Elizabeth we've been able to modify the trajectory of the LVC 211 and they will now be there to relieve you in 53 days We're on our way Elizabeth Hang tight Control out
