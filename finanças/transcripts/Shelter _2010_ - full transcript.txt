Go to work, think of something else. This won't help either. What did he say before he left? No point in waiting at home. Once he's home, he'll be grounded. No more parties. Did he say he will be late? What do you mean "sleep over"? What do you mean "sleep over"? Stop crying. Let's be sober now. My battery's low. Any news? Yes, almost! Did you hear him, coach? We should kick him out of our team! Think! Who could he be with? Where could he be? Panic won't help you now. Calm down. Calm down! Better go to work! No, don't wait at home. There's no point. Did you hear…? Can you drop me home because we have to… No problem. It was the referee's fault! He'll drop me off, if you don't mind. -What's wrong? Is there a problem? -No, everything's fine. Stoychev for president! Stoychev for president! Come here. Wait, I'll give you some. Now you can drink. Radostin! Radostin! Hello? Hello? Oh, it's you. I just got back. The dog hasn't been out for two days! It'll go mad! I tried calling him again but it's "No connection". Yes. I think we should go to the police. We'll go to the police and you'll explain everything. Well, whatever. I'll come and pick you up. Yes. See you! I want to report a missing person. Emil Stoychev… -Radostin. -…twelve years old. -His parents are here. -Radostin. -Pardon? -His name is not Emil, it's Radostin. Hold on a second. Make up your mind. -Radostin. -Radostin Emilov Stoychev. Radostin Emilov Stoychev. Yes. Since when is he missing? He was supposed to show up at home on Saturday but he didn't come. They don't know. Okay. Okay. Wait over there. -You haven't taken Blacky out, have you? -Rado did it before he left. Where does this dog pee? -I gave him fresh water. -I had given him some. And food, too. His bowl was empty when I got back home. Nice to meet you. Inspector Kostadinov. -Stoychev. -This way, please. They're in for drugs. Come in! Sit over there. Who will do the writing? Tell me in chronological order when and how your boy disappeared. -Can I charge my phone? -Yes, there. It was… …on Friday. Last Friday. We allowed him to go to a party. -I did… His father was away. -I was away. But something must've happened because he didn't come back. Let me explain the procedure: you give us details and write them down: time and date when your son left the house, with whom, where, what he was wearing. We count on your cooperation. Yes! What's that? Oh, thanks. Tell Rumen I'll call him as soon as I'm done here. According to your description, we'll inform the forces throughout the country. He's still a kid, he hasn't got an ID. Have you got a recent photograph? I wanted to ask the same thing. Do we have a picture? Let's do the writing now. To the Director of the Ministry of Interior. A report from: full name, personal number, address of residence. New paragraph, capital letter: Dear Sir… -My name? -Yours, of course. Dear Sir, comma, I request your cooperation in the search of my son, Radostin such and such, born on such and such date, living on such and such street. He lives at home. The person left our home at… time and date? -At seven… -Seven in the evening? -Yes. -Nineteen hours on… what date? -Yesterday. -When did you last see him? -She saw him on Friday. -In the evening. -And you? -On Thursday morning… Okay, put it down as I say: at 19 hours on October 23, 2009. And he's still missing. Did you allow your son to leave the house? -No! -Yes. Where did he go to? To a party? -A sleep over party. -You shouldn't have let him go. Sleep over? Isn't he too young for that? Why not, Emil? He's such a responsible child. And he needs to go out more. I would've never allowed this. But the moment I'm gone, you let him go. Why didn't you come earlier? For example yesterday. My husband told me not to worry, that he'd be back in the morning… You kept repeating he'd show up. Why didn't you come here yesterday? -I waited for you to come back home. -So you weren't at home? -No. -I had a match in Sofia. -What match? -Water polo. I'm a coach. I was away when it happened. -Then you must know Vasko? -Vasko? Vasko the Carp, Alexandrov's son. He also does water polo. Of course, I know him. He's an excellent swimmer. Swift, good reflexes… Really? He's not on my team, he's with the youngsters. -Is he your relative? -No. He's a colleague's nephew. Let's write. You were actually away when your son disappeared? -That's right. -You didn't know? He knew. We were constantly on the phone. Yes, at one point I was informed. Does Radostin have any brothers or sisters? We have a son. Fortunately, older. -He lives in America. -Any other relatives? -Aunts or uncles? Grandparents? -My parents live in the country. Doesn't he have a phone? I haven't stopped calling. His phone's been off since Saturday. Bad luck! Write down his number. It's very important. What was his phone? Has he done it before? Not coming back? -Never. -Well, we've let him out a few times. Where could he spend the night? I have no idea where he slept - neither on Saturday, nor on Friday. -No idea. -Has he got a girlfriend? There. His phone's the same. The phone doesn't matter, we need the number. -Has he got a girlfriend? -I don't know. He hasn't told me. He didn't share much. -Any problems at home? Any arguments? -No. Any marks or scars on the face, or the body? From operations? -No. -Was Rado… Is Rado a good student? Radostin was… a very good child. What was he wearing? He was with the hooded jacket… It is important. We will identify him by the clothes. Hello? Yes. Okay. Okay. Bye! Are you ready? I want you to read what you've just written. I have to leave you for a second. See if you haven't missed something important. Something he had with him: a rucksack, a bag, a briefcase… -A bag… -He had the gray… …the blue T-shirt. Not the green one with the picture in front? No, the blue one… -Wasn't it black, with a skull in front? -That one is hanging to dry. "Hanging to dry"… -Yes. He had the blue… -What trousers? -The jeans. -The blue jeans? The blue jeans, trainers and the hooded jacket. Inspector Georgiev. Let's start by telling me everything. They'll do nothing. Let's see whom we could call. What if somebody has murdered him and dumped him somewhere? We'll never see him again. Please! Let's not challenge fate! -Let's get off. -Here? We are on the next stop. Please, I don't feel well. I'm dizzy. Let's go. It's not raining that hard. Are you feeling sick? Please, don't cry here. Go home, don't wait for me. -Aren't you coming? -I am. I just need a moment here. You heard them. You should've gone to the police on Saturday. Why didn't you call me then? I would've told you to go. You told me not to worry! -Because you told me yesterday! -You had the match! If I was back next Friday? You would have probably waited till then. -Go home. -You should come, too. Don't stay here all alone. You're wet. You'll get a cold. Give me my bag, mate! Here, check this number. -I haven't even heard these… -Yeah, I could tell. -Can I make a copy? -Sure. Just don't give it to everyone. Radostin! What if I write ANARCHY not on the shoulder, but on my neck? Radostin! Come here! Is it Saturday morning now? -What day is it today? -It's Monday. -Speak up, I can't hear you. -It's Monday. When were you supposed to come back home? What? Not "what"! When were you supposed to get back home? On Saturday. -When? -On Friday or on Saturday. And what day is it today? -Do you want us dead? -No. Is that what you want? To see us dead. Tell me! -Tell you what? -Where were you? -Out. -Can't you hear what I am asking! I told you - I was out. And you never thought to give us a call? Speak up, Radostin! -When did you come back? -This morning. Don't lie to me. You weren't here this morning. Well, sometime in the morning. About eleven. Eleven. And where were you in the mean time? Little asshole! Little asshole! You know where we were? At the police, to report you missing. -They are searching for you now. -Why? -Who's that girl in the bathroom? -She's a friend. -Why don't you answer the phone? -My battery went flat. We thought you were dead. Your mother searched around for hours. -No, I just overslept. -We thought you were dead! No, I ain't dead. I was showing Courtney around. You'll be the end of us… What shall I do with you? I should bust you with beating! You dumb moron! And turn the music off! This music has drained your brains! It's off. Can't you see that? Don't you talk to me like this! Don't you dare… Stop! Where are you going? -Come back, you brat! -Emil! Your son's back! -Radostin! -I'm waiting for you to say: "Mum, dad, sorry for what I did." My dear boy! Where were you? Why didn't you call? -You know what you deserve? -Leave him be! -Mum, let me go! -Where were you? Tell me! You got us worried to death! He has fooled around with some degenerates. -That's not true! -One more word -and I'll snap your neck! I mean it! -Please, leave him be! -Go on protecting and defending him! -I'm not protecting him. -Just leave him be. -That's your achievement! -Contradicting me! -Your father's right. We were so scared and you didn't call. Of course I'm right! I thought we got on well, but this now? That's enough. Thank God, everything is okay and nobody's hurt. And that's enough for you? Next time this happens, I won't give a damn! Radi! Son, you have to promise me this won't happen again. You hear me? Rado! Can I see you for a sec? -Who's that? -What did I tell you? Rado! Rado, who's in the bathroom, son? He didn't come home alone! I came home because I thought you were at work. You think I feel like work in such a situation? Hi! -I'm Courtney… -These are mum and dad. Radi! You should've said we had guests! I'll go and get dressed. -Could I use the hairdryer? -Yes, of course. I'll bring it for you. Thanks, I know where it is. I'm really sorry about this situation. I badly needed a shower, Rado invited me and I came. Rado, I see food on the table. Are you hungry? And her? Let me ask her. Mum asks if we're hungry? -No, we just had a snack. -Anyway, let me fix something small. -Who's that girl? -She's a friend of mine. Where have I… Where have you met her? We met some time ago… We hang out together. Emil, please. Come with me in the kitchen. "They hang out together"? Stop it! Can't you see what's going on? What's going on? Stop acting stupid! Don't you see? No, explain it to me. You seem to see more. What should I give them to eat? Is this your biggest concern? I have some chicken in the freezer. -Where did you find them? -What? They were in the bathroom, the music was booming… And when they saw you? -Some nerve you've got! -What do you want me to say? Thank God, all is well and Rado is safe and sound. -Listen to yourself! -What? The girl behaves just fine! Take the knife and slice this. I've got some soup, too. I'll warm it up. Don't you think we've already got enough food? You think it's enough? I had instant soup somewhere. You know where I've put it? The return of the prodigal son! Who are you writing to? A friend. I'm telling him about the party. What? A friend from next door. I'm telling him about the party. -Give him my best. -He says he'd like to meet you. -And who's he? -Nikolai. We call him Niki the Head because he's the nerd in our class. -Has he got a picture? -Yeah, but it's a bit blurred. Oh, he's a nerd alright. No good! I like bad boys. I'll take this back. -There's only one cigarette left. -Let me check on my father's stock. -Your father keeps his cigarettes there? -No, I moved them here. There's nothing left. -Do you need this? -You can have it. I hope that wacko gets some… -We'd be dead without him. -Are you two together? -Don't be silly! -Yesterday I saw you kissing him. -So? -Well… Well… Do I have to marry everyone I've kissed? I know him from before. -Know who? Tenx? -He's quite popular in our town. -Really? -Once he was in the newspaper. That must be him. -Yeah? -Hi! -Hi! -I've got some booze. -It's raining outside. -C'mon, get in! This is yours. -Tenx. -Pardon? -Tenx, nice to meet you. -Violeta Stoycheva, the mother. Yeah, Rado's mentioned you. Right? -No, I haven't. -So, he hasn't. Hey! Come over here! It's Tenx. I was at his place and now he's come to my place. -We're friends. -Are we expecting anyone else for dinner? Well, altogether, I am hungry! Well, I've prepared this and that. -Who are these people? -Mum and dad. They are weird! What are they doing here? -They live here with me. -I see… Why aren't they at work? This is all I could get. The store was empty and they watched me closely. It's good you're here, mate. I got damn scared! They were on top of me, and I was naked. Crazy shit! -Didn't you get cigarettes? -I forgot. Mum's fixing dinner. You can stay, if you like. You nuts or something? Let's go to Kid's, we can smoke there. The rain and the wind are the punk's worst enemies. Mark my words! -Let's go! -Let me think. Think about what? -It's still raining! -So what? -Stay here for another while! -C'mon… -Let's go, please. -Hold on. Rain stops and we go. Okay? Radostin! Can I have a word? Come with me. -Who's that guy in your room? -I already told you. We're friends. Why doesn't he take his boots off, entering my house? Who's he? He's a friend. Mine and Courtney's. Radi, dear, ask the children if they like olives. I asked your father to ask them, but he's good at nothing. Calm down and don't start shouting. We have guests. -Why don't you go and buy some drinks? -Don't worry about the drinks. Didn't you see what that Indian brought? They said they like olives only if they're large and black. They are black, I think… I'll check. Rado, let's talk like real men. Now look… Have a seat. Now tell me: what's going on? First, you don't come back home. Then this… You really scared us, me and your mother. You're a big boy, you can look after yourself. Tell me, what's going on? You said the same thing when I wanted to buy an electric guitar with my own money, but you didn't let me. -What do you mean "your own money"? -I was saving. Didn't you tell me I could buy whatever I wanted? Yeah, but not a noisy guitar. We don't live in the fields. We've got neighbors. What makes me a big boy, then? Rado, this was last year. You've really grown up since then. Really? Fine. Tell me about this guitar then. Let's settle this. Okay then, when the rain stops, I'll leave with them. Okay! Go and tell your mother! Radi, dear, I couldn't find darker ones. -Did you hear what your son just said? -What? That he was going out with those hobos. Radostin, you'll wind me up as well! Whom am I doing this for? We'll have a proper dinner. You should respect other people's efforts! I'm glad you too got finally upset! I would've never let this happen! Note that! What would you have done? Lock him up in his room and swallow the key? Why doesn't he go missing when I'm here? It only happens when I'm gone. Well, it's not like he disappears and reappears every week! You know nothing, you see nothing but you know everything! -Stay here! -Shout! Louder! So that everyone hears! Why don't you beat them? Then you wonder why he leaves or doesn't share with you. -You're such a blockhead! -And you? Insulting me in front of him? Setting an example. Dear, go back to your room! Let him stay and hear it all from you. Some upbringing! Why are you shouting again? -How can he respect me, if you don' t? -So it's my fault now? -So this is your good example? -It's not my fault! -Sobbing won't… -And who are you to him? -What is your responsibility? -Don't you understand? -I thought that he was dead! -Dead? Don't you give that nonsense to me! Is it you, mate? What was her name? You should get rid of her! Well done, Rado! You'll make a real punk! -And what's that, mate? -What's what? -That. -It's a pen knife. -Where did you get it from? -My dad got it from somewhere. So it's his pen knife? No, it was a present for my birthday. Did you ask for it, or…? I didn't ask for it… -You can switch it on. -Seriously? Where from? There, at the bottom. It's blunt, mate! What a fucking nonsense! Wait! Wait a sec. Let me see! -Come here. We'll make you a Mohican! -Yeah, sure you will! -Let go of my hair! You hurt me! -Lie down here! -I'm hungry. -Eat wafers. I don't want wafers. Eat my dick, then! You know, I think you broke it. It's a piece of crap! -Is everything all right? -Why shouldn't it be? Can I help you with something? -Like what? -Slice the bread or something like that. We could wait till everybody's here! I told them half an hour ago dinner is to be served. Let me take them. There's no need for so much food. We are leaving soon anyway. -Where will you go? -To a friend of Tenx. -Who? -Tenx. I see. -This name is not Bulgarian? -No, it's his nickname. -Is he a friend of yours? -Well, yeah. And Rado knows this Tenx… I introduced them. Yesterday we were at his place. -Do you go to the same school as Rado? -No, I quit school last year. -Why? -School's a waste. The teachers don't give a damn, the students… They only think how to skip classes. Hasn't Rado told you about it? -Not really. -Ask him, if you don't trust me. I learn everything from the internet. That's where I met Rado. Yeah, he's stuck in front of that thing all day long. Rado's cool! We wanted to learn how to use this… "Skyte"? -Skype. -Skype. To talk to Milen, my other son. He's in America, for a year now. He quit his studies, everything… Us too. And left. He wanted to use Skype, because it's cheaper than phones. -Come, I'll show you. -No, no. The computer's on anyway! Rado, you should've taught your mum how to use Skype! -I tried but she doesn't want to. -Let's have dinner. You see? You're afraid Blacky might see your porn? Here, boy! Now, let me show you. It's real easy. -Hey, where does this dog pee? -Rado! Who's gonna take this dog out? -It pees on the balcony. -Wee-wee! There! You have an account. This is your password. -Did you get that? Moron! -Did you get that? First you click here, then here, then you type in a name. -Have you got your brother's Skype? -I have to log in first. -Fine! It's way too complicated! -No, it's not. It's easy. -What was his name? -Milen. -Who's that? -It's… My son who lives in America. -Surname? -Stoychev. -Let's write to him. What shall I write? -I have no idea… Ask him if they've got atmosphere there. -All right, ask him. -Now we'll just wait for him to add us. Add us? Rado, did you get that, dear? -Mum, I know all this stuff! -Rado'll explain later. Wash your hands and let's have dinner. Let's go eat. That's a fucking cool table! Beer? There's vodka, too. Is this rakia homemade? Homemade. From the shop. I've got a friend, who puts raisins in his rakia. Gets sixty degrees without any sugar. Another friend drinks lavender alcohol with sugar. He never gets a headache! God bless him! I'm eighteen. I can drink rakia. In this house we start eating when everybody's at the table. Whatever you say, boss! Radi, you sit here. I'll sit here, closer to the kitchen. And you, girl, you sit wherever you like. Can you pass me the rakia? She's seventeen. Can she drink? -So, she's under age. -Not that much under. Let the children eat! My folks have been giving me wine since I was a kid. -The eggplant salad is great! -Thank you. Glad you like it! These crocs are fucking cool! Leave it on! So, you're a grown up and can do whatever you like, eh? Drinking, voting, smoking… I'd never vote. I prefer drinking. What about you? -None of your business. -He voted for Boiko Borisov. Hush! No politics at the table! Get busy with your food! I'm an anarchist. I hate politicians, elections, the state… -I can get you a bottle opener. -No need. …and everything connected to them. If elections could change anything, they would've been banned. Not all young people, thank God, think like you. -That would be hell. -As if it's heaven now! In my opinion the system sucks. As long as we are governed… …we will be used and oppressed by invented laws. -That's it! -Anarchy! -Anarchy? -The irresponsible like you took us where we are. People in the countryside sell their vote for a sausage, and in the cities nobody wants to vote. Elections should be obligatory. Yeah, right. Obligatory. This is dictatorship! -In the villages it's like this. -As long as the morons keep voting. If the morons don't vote, elections are repeated. And that costs money. And who'll pay it? You? I doubt it. You don't look as if work. Do you? -Why should I? -To stop living like a parasite? -Stop kicking me! -I didn't kick you! -I asked you for something. -It was me, sorry. As if you get paid for your work? Work's only for fools and men, who want to escape from their wives. Yeah? And what do the smart guys do? Solve crosswords? My father goes fishing when he has a fight with mum, -or when I'm painting. -Are you an artist? I paint. So you also live on mum and dad. And what do you work? I asked Rado, but he was ashamed to tell me. Ashamed? That's not true! Just joking! My dad's a teacher, swimming and water polo. Your father is a coach. And we got this after the last match! Second place in the country! -Wow! -And why not first? That's how it is in sports. Someone has to come second. The referee was against us. Had it been a fair game, we would have been first. It's better to be one to the last, than to come second. Well, we've been that, too. -What's this nonsense? -Haven't we? If you're second, you're angry you're not first, and if you're not the last, you're just happy. That's not true. What is that logic? Second is second. That's it. But first is better. Here. Have some olives! Radi, dear. Why don't you eat? My dad's a swimming champion. He keeps his cup in the bedroom. Stay put! This was a long time ago. Back in '83. -In '83? -Yeah, back then. -Nonsense, it was in '81. -You never remember anything. It was in '83. I am certain. But I'd rather come second than one to the last! -Why? -I don't know. Did they stuff you with dope back then? The chicken is delicious, have some! -What dope? -Sorry, I don't eat meat. All professionals are on dope. But they don't catch them every time. Are you fasting? And in the past they'd give it, without you knowing it. I don't fast. God forbid! I just don't eat meat. How else did the Russians win so many medals? -No meat at all? -No animal products. What do you know about the Russians? Better drink your beer. Not even eggs? Eggs and cheese are okay. We've won medals in boxing and wrestling. How do you know? You weren't even born! I was a professional sportsman. I've never heard anything about dope. They did it without you knowing it. It's good to have meat every now and then. Your body needs it. Or you'll become anemic. -Why's the beer so far? -Here you are. Help yourself, nobody's stopping you. It was really cold last night. Where did you sleep? At my place. I live behind the stadium. Are there houses there? There's just a field. There are garages. You live in a garage? Yeah, why not? -How do you heat the place? -I guess they make fire, like gypsies. During the night it's cold. Winter's gonna be tough, Tenx. But you have electricity, don't you? -No, there's no electricity! -There was. They cut it off. But if you pay, they'll switch it on again. Right? -I've no intention of paying! -Didn't you have electricity last year? Yes. I was stealing it. But now they check on me all the time. Fuck them! You must pay for electricity! Is electricity theirs? Did they invent it? It existed before them; it will exist after them. They want us, fools, to pay for it. No way! It is for everyone! And who will pay for it? Me? Whoever wants to! Anarchy! -How did you get warm last night? -Anarchy warmed them! We used blankets. Would you say it's legal? You want to live on my back, don't you? I live on my own back and I don't complain, as you do. Excuse me? Excuse me! Can I smoke in here? I guess not. I'll go out for a drag. How come you've got cigarettes? I just have them. You want one? There! Radostin, what's wrong? Don't you like it? -I like it. -Eat then. I made it for you! Can't you see? He's got no respect for us. Just look at his "gang". He'll be like them soon enough. A drunkard and a junky. -They're cool, don't you think? -They are a pain in the ass! Especially the old prick! Keeps asking me weird questions. -Rado, I like your dad's jokes. -Yeah? Do you see him every day? And your mum's a good cook. And kind, too. Just look at his face! He's got a cop's face! -He's never been a cop. -What has he been then? -A coach. -That's bullshit, Tenx. Let him be! How could he know this? His father was a cop, he got fired for his incompetence and had to start swimming. His face is alright. An ordinary person. He looks like a fascist to me. Like somebody that beats people on the streets. How much longer are we waiting for them Indians? They're still smoking. -So? -Stop it, Emil! They'll hear us! Will you stop nagging at me! Whatever I say, you jump on me. Can't you see them for what they are? They can slit your throat open. Yeah, and yours too! Stop it! They might even get rewarded in their tribe. Come! Help me with the dishes. I need you to open a jar for me. Punks! I also liked Deep Purple when I was young but… If only I had some power! What jam did you fetch from the cellar last? -Apricots. -It's finished. Look again. -What's going on? Where's everybody? -In the kitchen. What for? -You done smoking? -Yes. And how does it feel like? It feels like a cigarette. -Didn't you put something in it? -My husband also smoked, but now, with the EU and all, I don't let him. People smoke in the EU, too. Did you think they didn't? Yeah, they put them in these glass boxes …as they drag, it gets really foggy inside. -Who puts them? -OK, they get in themselves. That's worse than Hitler. It's good that I quit smoking. In the EU a pack will cost 8 levs. -We'll smoke "Sredec" again. -They will get expensive too. -We'll start rolling. -When did you smoke? -You saw me. -Did I? When? -Both of you have seen me! -Emil? -I've never seen him. -Yes, you have! I have never seen you smoke! He has seen me! -He smokes one or two. -What? What do you mean "what"? Do you smoke cigarettes or other stuff? -Like mint flavored fags? -You'll taste mint if I smack you! I asked a simple question. Have you smoked drugs? What drugs, mate? I hope you haven't, Rado! What about alcohol? It's also a drug. Compared to it weed is pure innocence! Cheers! I never thought you'd fall that low. I've never been drunk in the gutter. I've never come home drunk. I bought you everything that you wanted. And you end up with some junkies! -Hey, take it easy, eh! -Shut the fuck up or I'll smack you! -Let's see how tough you are! -Emil! Gimme another one! C'mon, prick! Get the hell out of my house, you lousy scum! Tenx, let's go! Thanks for the food! -You fucking… -Please! Emil! Please! -Stop it! Calm down! -Get lost, you… -Wait for me! -Where are you… Where are you going? Rado? Where are you going, dear? Get your filthy hands off me! I'll take Blacky for a walk. Hasn't been out for three days. Am I such a failure as a father? What kind of question is this? Tenx, wait for me! -What do you want? -I wanna come with you! -What for? -I don't know… Anarchy? Go back to mummy and daddy! Tenx, I'm sorry! -What for? -I didn't mean things to go wrong! Tenx, it's not his fault! Okay. Now get lost! Get lost! C'mon! What are you gonna do with us? Go home to mummy. Don't you see she's worried? You're not like us. You've got a family, you've got your own room, your PC… …a dog, a penknife… So? Have you ever seen a punk who owns a PC? -Why not? -Punks don't have PCs. Nonsense. I have one at home. And I don't. And I don't need it. I'm bored with mine, anyway. -'Cos you only play games on it. -I don't play games! -I saw you! -When did you see me? Emil! Emil! Come! What is it? Come here. -What's going on? -Milen is on Skyte! What shall I write to him? I… Move over. Let me do this! -Who's there? Hello? -Milen? Is that you? -Yeah. Who's there? -It's me, your mum, Milen! -Well, hello, mum! -Hello! Milen, I can hear you well! -I don't hear you so well. -How are you? I'm fine, I'm working. I don't complain. I don't have much spare time. Aren't you coming back? We miss you! I might come back for the summer, with Monica. -Who? -Monica, my girlfriend. I want to show her Bulgaria. That's great! We'd be delighted to meet her! -He's got a girlfriend! -And how about you? Your father's next to me. Tell him something. C'mon. His voice sounds very weird. -Hi, Milen! -Hello? -Your mother drives me mad! -Hi! How are you? Here it's raining. It's getting colder here too. How are you, dad? We have a problem with your brother. -With whom? -With your brother. Hello? Can you hear me? -What brother? -With Radostin. We have problems with him. He's on drugs. I don't have a brother. -Milen, can you hear me? -Yes, I can. -Milen, is that you? -It's me. -Who are you? -I'm Milen. But I don't have a brother. Not one that I know of. I think there's been a mistake. How did you find me? I don't know… She… Your mother… Well, she's not yours… Anyway. -And who are you? -Me is me. And who are you? Did he hang up? I don't know. I think he did. I… I'll take Blacky out for a walk. Yes? Yes… Speaking. Yes… -We are the parents of a boy who… -Radostin Emilov Stoychev. -They told us he's here. -Has he been arrested? They said so, but it must be a mistake. Radostin… Radostin… Yes, we've got a Radostin. No mistake. Wait a second. The Stoychevs for Radostin. Mind the steps! Come in! You'll see him later. C'mon, come in! Sit down. We have to go through some details. We found him on the street with two more kids: a girl who had some drugs… Sylvia Georgieva Dimitrova, 17 years old… …from Sofia. And a boy that lives in the garages next to the stadium. Borimir Ilkov. He's a regular here. -Can we see him? -As soon as we go through this… Bring Radostin here, Milanova! Kids, you know. Thank God, it didn't get serious. You could claim he was kidnapped and then we can be certain that he was coaxed into it. He's just a kid, after all. Radostin is not like this. We are not like this. I am a swimming coach, I train Rumen's son. -Rumen? -Your colleague, you know. He doesn't have a son. His nephew! Now! There's our hero! Radostin, my boy, why don't you tell mum and dad where you were. Tell them! Whom you were with, where you went to, what you did… It must've been exciting. Won't you tell us about your friends? Who are they? What do they do? They're my friends. Friends, you say? Tell your parents more. -They know enough. -No, they don't. Yes, they do. He hates them. He even smacked Tenx. Because he trashed the cupboard! No, 'cos he's an anarchist and because he smokes. And you smoke in the garage, hiding from mum, thinking I don't know. You haven't mentioned that you knew his company. We didn't. We saw them first time today, colonel, sir. -I'm not a colonel. -Okay… We found them at home. I found them. When I got back home, the girl was in the bathroom, naked, and the boy brought in alcohol. -So you know them. -No, I don't. But you've seen them before? They sneaked into the house. Hadn't I come in time, they would've robbed us! They tried to rob you? -Yes! -What are you saying, Emil? They used Radostin to get into the house. I just gave them something to eat. Chicken with rice. Thieves sneak into your house and you give them chicken with rice? That's what I'm trying to explain. It's a mistake. Ma'am, let me explain to you! You're saying that after you reported to us this morning you saw the missing person, but didn't let us know? Do you know how much a case like this costs? -Not only money, people, time… We alerted the border police! How do you expect respect from the police when you don't respect us? Are you aware we can sue you for concealing information? How can you let him out with people you don't know? They will be sued for drugs! Where's your responsibility as parents? Take him and make sure I don't see him ever again! -Rado, stop that banging! -Stop it, dear, it's annoying! Hello? Hello? Milen! My dear! How are you? Yes? Okay! Your dad's next to me! Rado's… fine. He's here too. No, we're not at home. We're on our way. We're here on a bus. Milen, I've got my own account! Yes! Some friends did it for me… Rado's friends. Call me on Skype. When we get home, let's try to talk. Okay. How are you? That's good! Wanna hear your dad? Hello? Do you still go swimming? Rado doesn't… Subtitle translation by: Alexander Marinov - Sancho
