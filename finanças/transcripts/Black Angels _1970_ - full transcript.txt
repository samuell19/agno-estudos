This here punk is going to become president of the Choppers, baby, right on. Oh, wow. Knifer's getting soft. Besides, the gang is going to be mighty impressed to hear how I take Chainer. Chainer? Yeah. I'm doing a number one Chainer today. All by yourself? Yeah, why? I've got it all planned. I'm going to flush him out of his territory, and make him chase me, then trap him, pow! Why, Jimmy? Because Chainer is all white. And his white is pale, and pale is sick, and I hate all sickness. That's why. You hate, Jimmy. You hate too much. Not enough, baby. Whitey's gonna pay plenty before we're through. You've changed. I'm a new shade of black. An all new breed. [engine revving] [screeching tires] Oh, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy! [screeching tires] Wow, bitchin'. [engine revving] [screeching tires] [screeching tires] [crash] [screeching tires] [honking] [screeching tires] [honking] [sirens] Get off the road, you suit. [screeching tires] [honking] [bell ringing] [screeching tires] [screeching tires] [birds chirping] All right, Chopper, I'm gonna bust you wide open. You ain't bustin' nobody, Whitey. Why, you're just a punk kid. What are you trying to prove? I'm a Chopper, and I ain't scared of you, Chainer. You ain't, huh? Well maybe you'd be a lot better off if you were. Now if you tell me you're sorry you busted the window, I just might let you go, kid. I ain't scared of you. Now you want me to say I'm sorry, you've gotta make me say it! I'm giving you a break, take it. Now get out of here, kid! Ain't you had enough, boy? Never. I'll kill you, Chainer. You're forcing me to teach you a lesson, boy. Boy? Ah, son of a-- Oh.

Now that's better. Chopper colors on, there ain't nothin' you can't do. Ah! [engine revving] Get out of the way! Ah! [crash] [engine revving] You almost killed me! Look at my bike. I'll break your neck. I'll wrap that steering wheel around your head, you white piece of junk. [engine revving] [woman giggling] You're not such a tough guy when your gang's not around. Ha, ha. Besides, I've got you where I want you, now. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah? Yeah. Ha, ha. [slap] Ow. Don't play games, huh? Come here. Come on. [slap] Oh! You like that, huh? Mm-hmm. Mm, I know you do. [crash] [engine revving] [drunken humming] [engine revving] [drunken humming] [engine revving] I could do that! [engine revving] [engine revving] [screeching tires] [engine revving] [screeching tires] Don't try that. Don't try that! [screaming] [explosion] Shit. [police radio chatter] Let's go, Lieutenant. I want to check on Chainer's gang. Head to the park. Probably a garbage dump by now, long haired dirty freaks. [laughter] (GIGGLING) Well, well, well, lookey here. Look who's looking us over, the black angel, himself. Ha, ha look what the cat's dragged in. Lieutenant Hopper, super fuzz. [laughter] [crash] Where's that beer your ordered? [honking] You, hoo, the beer is coming, and so am I. Let's go out and get it. Let's go. Hi, gang. Oh, hi, simply hi. You're late. We don't like people to be late. Oh, I'm sorry sir. There's some beer in the back, and some ice, and I'll just go get it. Just a second, sweetheart. We'll get it. Wouldn't want to trouble you, now. Yes, sir, whatever you say, sir. How come you're late, huh? Well, sir, you see there was some mix up in traffic on the way out, sir. You know what we do to yo-yos that keep us waiting? Oh, no I don't, sir. [slap] Oh. Oh that smarts. Oh. [air horn] [train passing] You got a lot of nerve, chain rattler. Clickety, clickety. A lot of nerve to walk in here. One of your boys needs your help, Knifer. Oh yeah? What's the matter with him? He's dead, that's what. Dead? He tried to jump the ravine. The one by the river bed. Yeah? He tried and he missed. If you don't lift him out of there, it's gonna be pigs and the meat wagon. It's up to you. Get out of here, Chainer. Let him go. Hey, Chainer! You got a lot of nerve to come here. Yeah. [engine revving] [police radio chatter] Pick him up, Lieutenant? Cool it, let's give him some more rope. [police radio chatter] [engine revving] (WHISTLING) Who the hell's wasting a beer? That ain't beer, me love, it's champagne. I just blessed you, dear child, with my golden shower. This time I'm gonna kill you, Frenchie, you filthy no good egg suckin' finger lickin' snot pickin' scuzzy faced runt. [laughter] And I [inaudible] had to believe you were thinkin' of using a nasty word. Come on, now, I'll kill you, Frenchie. [cheering] Oh, I'm gonna cut your guts out. Come on. [cheering] Ah! Oh. Frenchie! Hey, baby. Hey, Big Jim. Fun is fun, but you touch, you even breathe your bad breath germs on that baby, and I'll eat your yellow heart for my din din, just like I done your buddy up in Bakersfield. Bet Chainer ain't forgettin' that. Go tell daddy Chainer I peed all over his little baby. Why don't you tell him, huh? Why don't you unless you're too Kentucky fried to face him. Yeah, and you think you want to take over. You think. Just wait around, big warlord Jim. Just wait around and see. For what? You ain't gonna be around. Hey, there, pray little boy. Frenchie. [thud] Wah! Chief. Chainer. Hey, friend. Hey. He-- he peed all over me. [crowd murmuring] Hey, wait a minute, man. I mean, well like, well like, you know. I mean. Hey, oh, by. Hey. Hey, now. I'll catch up with you later, huh? Hey, you guys. Hey, wait for me. [cheering] [engine revving] [engine revving] [engine revving] What have you got there? You wouldn't want to soil your hands? Oh, no, not Lieutenant Harper. Don't get smart with me! Yeah, [slap] That's a privilege only for the man. What ever happened to the law? He is the law. Oh. [laughter] Atta boy, Lieutenant Harper, check it out. And while you're at it, fix it, because I got air in my battery cable. [laughter] Hey, Lieutenant Harper, that's my momma's bike. Put some air in the tires. [laughter] Look out, Harper, you might become a junkie. [laughter] GANG: Goodbye, Lieutenant Harper, and have yourself a ball. Goodbye, Lieutenant Harper, and don't come back at all. [laughter] [engine revving] [engine revving] [music playing] [laughter] Frenchie. Yeah, Chief? Your beef with Big Jim, anything I should know about? Poor child's gonna die soon. And if I tell you no? That's stepping on my personal toes, Chainer. Just the same, I want you to cool it. BIG JIM: Give me him. [baby crying] Kiss and make up? No go. I'm sorry, Chainer, but no go. Then I gotta make it an order, Frenchie. Now you cool it 'till I say otherwise. Now I don't like the way Harper's been hovering over us. And one of the Choppers got killed today. Oh yeah? Great. That's the best news I've had all day. One less for us to handle. We stick together. No beefs between brothers, at least until I find out if there's going to be fun and games. Yeah, well, as long as you put it that way, like it's club business, then I guess. Only the minute you sound the all clear, I'm gonna to take him. Club business. And I've got to find out about his boy getting hit. Ah, you hit him? No, in fact I tried to lose him. Dumb kid went into the ravine by the winery. Ouch. Tried to follow me over. Ain't no deck of cards with five aces, Skullbones. I'm gonna slick your guts. Stick it out, One Eye, so I can cut it off. Bust them up, will ya? And pass the word, cool it for a day or so. Yeah, OK. Children, children, can it. Cool it! Chainer says you quit. I sure wouldn't give no ban like that. Maybe Chainer's getting soft. [baby crying] Let's have another one. Yeah, you wanna? BIG JIM: Yeah, why not? Chainer! Chainer! [engine revving] Chainer! Hey, Chainer! What's the matter, Victor? Some guy on a Limey being chased by Harper. So what? Well the dumb Limey's bringing Harper here. What? Shall I step on it? No. SGT. MORRIS: He should have lost us a long time ago. What do you think, Lieutenant? What do you think, Chainer? Some biker's leading Harper this way, why? It's an accident, the guy don't know it's our pad. An accident? I'll give him one. Quick, get this and stash him. Why should we? He's being chased by a black angel, that's why. That ain't good enough for me. Well, it's good enough for me. Now will you stash him, move it! [yelling] [engine revving] Hey, what's going on? Why, Lieutenant Harper, what a heartwarming welcome surprise. OK, where is he? Where's who? Come on, Chainer, where's the rider on the English bike? A Limey? Why, Lieutenant, we wouldn't let a Limey bike anywhere near us. It might crossbreed with one of our choppers, give us a litter of runts. We couldn't have that, now could we, fellas? No. No. No way. Sargent Morris, take a look around, see what you can find. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Lieutenant, I hate to trouble you, but this pad of ours is private property. It belongs to Philly Zolman. Now if it's all the same to you, I'd like to take a look at your search warrant. Always wanted to know what one looked like. Of course, if you don't happen to have one with you. Don't push me, Chainer, just don't push me. Why not? You push me. You push us. Look around? Forget it. Chainer, come here. Lieutenant! You come here. Saw you this morning, playing follow the leader with one of the Choppers. So? You might say Knifer's pretty uptight about it. You might even say he's been gathering a little war party, go after a little revenge. Whatever Knifer and his Choppers decide to do don't concern me in the least. It might concern you little more if he decides to move in. The Choppers and us, we've been coexisting for years, a nice, peaceful, coexistence. Just you leave us alone. Just the same, think about it. Such a shame you have to rush off. We were so hoping you could stay for din din. We're having fresh roast suckling pig. We'll be back. Oh, that's simply grand. We, all of us, relish these little visits. Now if you can make it next time, you let us know, and we'll come see you at your house. [slam] [engine revving] Why do you take that, Lieutenant? What's up? I've got my reasons. He tipped me off that the Choppers were on the warpath. Aw, that's sure as hell nothin' for us to worry about. Yeah, yeah, I know. But what I can't figure out is why is Harper so damn good to us all of the sudden? Well, who can guess what goes on in a cop's mind. Just the same, keep an eye on the farm. And maybe we'd better take a trip into town, see what kind of activity's going on. Sure, I can dig that. Now we got ourselves some company. [crowd chatter] Ha, ha! Oh, boy. Outta the haystack, Limey. Aw. Come on, let's go, Limey. [crowd taunting] What's your story, boy? Answers, baby, and they'd better be right. Name. Well, sir, they call me Johnny. Well, shut my mouth. Ha, ha. Johnny Reb, huh? Yep, Johnny Reb, all right. Who'd you ride with? Where you from? Dallas, Texas. I've been there. Spent a year there one day. [laughter] You on the run? Yep. CHAINER: Why? Well, I worked my old lady over with a ball bat. [laughter] Give him a hand and dig his wheels out. Big Jim, Frenchie, come here. [music playing] Hey, you guys, quit rockin' the bed. Hey! Well, what do you think? Trouble. Think it's a put on? Aw, leading Harper, coming right here, too much of a coincidence. Aw, he could be trying to follow Victor, hoping Victor would help him shake the fuzz. In the whole of Southern California, he manages to ride right here, with Harper nipping on his heels. I don't like it. Well, if he's a plant, who's he working for, Harper? Easy. Harper was chasing him. That means nothin', man. Well, he ain't from the Choppers, that's for sure. Why sure? Maybe he just don't have the suntan for it. Bah. Look, Harper says Knifer's getting itchy, and Johnny Reb's just libel to come in handy. Sort of a natural enemy, so to speak. I don't like it, Chainer. Well, Harper could be trying to get evidence from the inside, it's possible. How do we find out? That's easy, we ask him. Hey, Machete, bring Johnny Reb in here. [music playing] You crashed our pad, we'd like you to cooperate. Sure 'nuf. Empty your pockets, everything. Yeah, well, sure. Kinda short on bread, ain't you? I can make out all right. Hey, y'all don't think I'm some kind of cop or something, do you? What else have you got in your pockets. Well, I got me this here stuff. A couple of roaches, and some uppers. Yeah, I guess he ain't no cop. And this. You'll do. Well, sir, that's just fine. Does that mean that I can go on my way now, with your kind permission? Easy, Choppy, stay there, boy. Come on. It means you can ride with us if you want. Trial basis, then we see if you want to make it for good. You said trial basis, huh? Yeah, well, I just reckon I might give you guys a try. See if you're up to my standards. Take him around, make with the introductions. [growl] Easy, Chop, come on. Yeah, easy, Chop, lay down. Come on, that's it. I still say you should be careful. There's a couple of little things that don't tell us for sure. Frenchie, any cat that would work his old lady over with a ball bat can't be all that bad. Ha, ha, ha. Hey, you! Tell Knifer to come here, I want to talk to him. Right now, boy. Boy! Yes sir, master. Yes sir, master. Yes sir, master. Yes sir, master. Yes sir, master. Yes sir, master. Aren't you in the wrong part of town, Lieutenant? I see your boys chipped in to pay for the funeral. Yeah, we take care of our own. I've counted four funerals in the last six months. So, what's it to you? I just paid a little call on Chainer and his pack. They seem to be getting ready for something. So what? Just see you play it cool. It's my job to head off trouble, you hear? Listen, Charlie, we've had enough of your kind of help. 300 years of your bullshit. From now on, we take care of our own! [slam] [engine revving] [music playing] What did the black angel want? Tip me off that Chainer's on the warpath. That's sure as hell nothing for us to worry about. Yeah, but what I can figure out is why the black angel is so good to us. Think we ought to fall over out Chainer's hang out and take a look. Yeah, let's do that. Only don't forget, I've got a good pair of eyes watching Chainer. [music playing] Sounds like Chainer's got his whole pack. [engine revving] Yeah! [music playing] [cheering] [engine revving] [music playing] Enough of you, Vlad. Give us some service over here! Coming! How you doing, Bubbly? How am I doing what? [laughter] How come she's working here? What's the matter with you? It's that new guy with Chainer. Bubbly? She's a gas. Aw, you ain't gonna let no confederate cap get to you, are you? Well, it ain't that, there's just somethin' about him. Yeah, but don't her kind belong with the gang you guys are watchin' for? By her kind, I take it you mean black people. Black people? Where I come from, there's only one word fer 'em. Hey! Can't you take the white sheet off for one minute? Any beef we have with Knifer has to do with territory, not color. If you were any kind of an artist, cracker, you'd know that black and white go good together when you let them. Bull shit. Hi ya, Bubbles, baby. Do you know there's something in what Johnny Reb says? If we were to tangle with the Choppers, sure as hell somebody would say it was on account of color. In this country a white man can't have a decent fight with a black man without everybody saying it's racial. Eh, I gotta go. Be right back. [music playing] I gotta go, too. What are you gonna do, help him? [laughter] What's the matter, sweet, jealous? [music playing] MAN: Watch the scum show off. [laughter] I think the Boy Scout wants to tell us somethin'. [laughter] I just figured it out. This place ain't big enough for the both of us. Yup. Clear out, scum. My goodness, how tall are you gentlemen? 6' 5". 6' 6". I didn't know they stacked it that high. [music playing] Ha, ha, come here, hun. Bum. OK, Choppers, come on. Come on. Come on, Chainer. Hold it, Reb. That's the oldest gag in the world. Follow them in the alley, and they're waiting for you. What's the matter, you turning chicken? What'd you say? What did you say? Don't push your luck, Reb. [music playing] You OK, Fixer? Like, wow, man. Oh boy. Hey, (WHISTLE) what happened? What took you guys so long? [laughter] Get out, get outta here. Look at this guy. Ah, I got this one myself. Take him away. Out! Out with the garbage. I don't want them here. What can I tell you? [laughter] [knocking] Ah, so it is. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. Aw, I've got my bike apart. I'm gonna bust. Come on, get the tables fixed. You should have seen the number I did on his face. Aw, ha. You guys been having some fun? Ah, just playin' around, Chainer. Why don't you guys help him clean it up, huh? Sure. Come on, baby, up, up, up, up. What did he try to pull? Knock it off, Frenchie, just drop it. Now listen, Johnny Reb is OK. OK? OK. Maybe we'd better go back to the farm and get set. I'd like to make one move to talk to Knifer. Get out of here, Chainer. Get out or get killed. And if it doesn't work, [smack] Come on, let's drink. [music playing] Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. This morning I told you to go to the park. You didn't. Oh, does it mean I'm going to be punished? You're late. Oh, do I get a spanking and go to bed without my dinner? Somehow I always end up in bed. [smack] -Slut! Animal! Shut up! Don't tell me what to do. What did you say? I said, don't tell me what to do. [smack] [laughter] You slumming nympho. Nympho, maybe. Slumming, definitely. You bastard. Ha, ha, ha, ha. You Texas punching board. One of these days I'm gonna make a momma out of you. And I'll love every minute of it. Just tell me when. When? When? Did you hear that? I'm going to have all of you, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha. [smack] Kill you. [music playing] [cheering] [honking] Ha, ha ha. Get off of there. You'll leave your bad germs all over it. Wow, sorry gotta get a glove, quick! Let's go. All right, come on, that's enough. Will you kids let go? All right, look, I don't wanna call the cops. Enough! Let go! [siren] Do you want met to call the police? Hey, will you look there. The black angel, himself. You're a policeman, stop them. Well, that's what happens when you drive a Caddy. You got the door, you got the cops, just like that. [snap] [engine revving] Jackie! You're a policeman, go get them. One of those bums kidnapped my daughter. Kidnapped? Well, no, not exactly. They're taking my daughter off somewhere, and I don't even know where it is they're taking her. [engine revving] I'll catch up with ya. Chainer just took hisself a little detour, by way of Malibu hills. I wonder why he did that. [laughter] Maybe he wants us to think he's got nothing to worry about. [laughter] [engine revving] Sit right down here. [laughter] Give over the joints. You got some of those for Chainer? Yeah, hey, anything for Chainer. Take what you want. And one for me. Whatever turns you on, baby. [laughter] So I ducked down, and I give him a shot. And I jump up and I give him another shot. And that's the end of it. Hey, where's Johnny Reb? [engine revving] Yeah, where is he? He get lost? I don't know, he dropped out, took a side tour. [engine revving] Nobody drops out without Chainer's OK. [engine revving] Yeah, well he don't know the rules yet. [engine revving] [music playing] [chatter] What you got there? High octane uppers, enough for everybody. I ain't never seen nothin' like these before. High octane, man, latest thing out. We got a rule about nobody drops out of the fold during a ride. Yeah? Hey, well, I didn't know. Sure, OK this time. I thought maybe you went out for a chick. Oh, man, I know better than to bring somebody else around here, bird or nuttin'. Good. Where's yours? Took mine already. Five. I'm flyin', ye haw! [laughter] Well, here's to you. Thanks. Sure, man. Like I figure, y'all are nice enough to be hospitable, the least I can do is bring along a little somethin' to add to the party. Yeah. Well, John, make yourself to home. You know, what you need is something to, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Wallflower. She looks all right. Go ahead, help yourself. Whose old lady is it? Old lady? Ha, ha. You're learnin' fast. Nobody's, but she hangs around with the gang anyway. She's scared to death of the Choppers. Afraid the boogiemen are gonna get her. Ha, wrong color, she's got a thing about that. Where I come from, that's the way it is. That's why I thought of her. You two make a good pair. Go head, enjoy. All right. Hey, kid, come here. Pass them out, but give me one. OK. Give me another one. All right. Go. What did I tell you, Reb? All right. [laughter] Hey, Chainer, here's some uppers from Johnny Reb. Hey. Here. No, man. I don't want no uppers. Take it. Uh-uh. Frenchie, I told you to take it. I don't like it. Where'd you get them? Johnny Reb. Hey, Big Jim. You went and wrecked my fun. Oh, what did I do? I was gonna wait and see how long it took those two to get together. You had to go play Cupid. You mean stupid. Something itching you? As if you didn't know. [laughter] Hey, you guys, hey, you guys, look what I got. Uppers. Hey, come on. No, no, now wait a minute. I'll trade you some for some joints. I say when, baby, I way when. OK, now. [laughter] [chatter] Hey, boy. Yeah, Johnny, yeah? Let me have some uppers, for my girl. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Thank you, man. That Johnny Reb, he sure don't waste no time. Reb did say these were uppers, didn't he? Something bugging you, Frenchie? Maybe. Yeah. Maybe. Well, can it, whatever it is. You don't have to be from the south to be sensible about things like that. Where are you from? Sacramento. You better believe it, blacks know where they belong in Sacramento. Well, Big Jim was telling me how you hang around here because you want to be real sure none of them haters ever get near you. Well, there's some girls would, you know. Me, I think I'd kill myself before I'd ever let one of them even near. Yuck. JOHNNY REB: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I know what you mean. WOMAN: I don't have anything against men, it's just blacks. Ha, ha. [engine revving] [scream] Let me go! Let me go! Help! Help! [screaming] [tires screeching] Let me go! Let me go! Get out. Let me go! Let me go, you animals! You punks. You animals. You black animals. A passer. A honky. Fake. Ape. King Kong. That's what you are. Right on, baby. Right on. [spit] How did you get out of the jungle? White trash. Who do you think you are, turning us on like this? We're not made of rock. But we're blood, baby, blood. Soul brother, we're gonna have us a honky tonight. A dynamite honky. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Uh! Ugh! Oh! They're the most down flyin' uppers I ever had. Yeah. Something still bugging you? Just curious about a couple of things, that's all. Like what? Like a guy drops out to pick up a stash of pills. Fine! Great! Fantastic! Of course, he's only been in town a couple of days, already he's got a connection. It ain't that hard to find a connection. So OK, a guy can find pills. When you checked his wallet today, you said yourself he was short of bread. So it's one thing to find pills, you ever hear of a pusher takin' credit cards? Ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah, it is kind of strange. keep an eye on him. Ye haw! [engine revving] [music playing] What are you? Black, baby, black. Agh! Ha, ha, ha. Gah! Huh. Hey, Jim, you hear somethin'? Yeah, it sounded like Frenchie shoutin' somethin'. Go check on it, will ya? Yeah, yeah. All right. [engine revving] [cheering] [laughter] [cheering] (YAWN) Hey, Knifer, soul brother. Worked like a charm, man. Ha, ha. I thought you was gonna give yourself away. Hey, I've been passin' for Mr. Charlie for years. Oh my god, Choppers, Choppers, Choppers! (YAWN) Come on, you guys, you're on downers. Move it, everybody. Come on, get out of here. Choppers! Choppers! Choppers. Chainer! You guys move your ass. Get out of there. Come on. Get out, go on. Hey. (YAWN) [roar] Come on. Come on! No, man, I ain't goin' nowhere. [screaming] You stay with that kid. All right? And don't you leave it. [screaming] [roar] [yelling] Knifer! Burn, baby, burn! Keep 'em high. [yelling] [growl] Yeah! [scream] [yelling] Ah! [scream] [roar] [scream] [hissing] [scream] [yelling] [roar] [music playing] Not the baby! Hey, man. Jackie! Daddy! Get on. [rattle]
