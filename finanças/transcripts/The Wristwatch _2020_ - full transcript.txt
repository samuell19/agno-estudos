Give me a minute. - I don't have a minute. - Yeah, it's all yours. - Honey? Honey? Honey? - Don't. - Come on. - Just go. Just go. - You're good, you're good. - Oh. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No. It's all right. Oh, God. - Gonna be all right. - I ran outta pot yesterday. - I'll get you some. - No, no. Just... I have some pills left. Just pick me some up after work, okay? - Okay. - You smell like booze. - I'm okay. - Go take a shower. - Yeah. - Hey, what are you doing, Jerry? Hey, that's not your sign. - So what! - Don't make me get up. - Hey, how are ya, pal? '64 Barracuda? Oh, '65. Oh, no, no, a little change will do, just a little change. It's only gonna go to the nearest pawn shop. - You leaving? - I have a doctors appointment. - Yeah, but are you leaving leaving? - I don't know, probably. - I can kick these losers out anytime. - It's okay, Steph. - I'm headed up to a party in Riverside tonight. Gonna be some sick dj spinning, you should come. - I'll call you. - You're my bestie. - Thank you. - You need any help? - Um, I think I got it. Bye. - Hey, and I'm meeting Stan afterward for drinks. Okay? Thanks. - Goodbye. - Hey. - You shouldn't be here, Brandon. - Look, I just need to take a quick shower and I'll be out of your hair, all right? - All right, come in. Hurry up. - A cyber force for years, but have- - What am I gonna do with this thing? Right of way! I got the right of way! You must be new in town. - Kevin. I just got here from Santa Cruz. And, uh, people sure are generous around here. I jumped a train the other night with a- - It's not my business. Take a hike. - What do... what do you mean I gotta go? - It's my spot. Get outta here! - No, you weren't here when I got here and this is public property, I don't have to go. - Take your business and take a hike, pal. - No! - Hey, don't put your hands on me, I'll file a restraining order on you. I got eight restraining orders on eight other bums around here. - Get outta here, you greedy bum! - You better be gone by the time I come back. - I'm not leaving! - What you looking at? - 120 over 80, that's very good. Gloria, can you bring Rorry's medical card up when you're finished with her. Think we punched the numbers in wrong. Thanks. - Thank you. - Can I get some water? When will this morning sickness end? - You're beginning your second trimester? - Yeah. - It should be ending pretty soon. The second trimester can be the best part of a pregnancy. The baby starts to move, your belly starts to show. Aren't you excited? - Sometimes. - Oh. - I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling well. - It's okay, your uncle will be right in. - Thanks. - Dr. Phillips? - Yep? - Your niece is waiting for you in room one. - Thank you, Gloria. - You're welcome. - Hey, there. - Hi, Uncle Keith. How's Aunt Karen? - Not good. Cancer spread. - I'm sorry. I'm gonna go visit her. - She'd like that. This all looks pretty good. When was the last time you went to your OBGYN, Dr. Massy? Never mind, it's right here. Five weeks ago? I want you to see him next week. - Okay. - What brings you here today? - I feel like crap. My glands are swollen, too. - They are swollen. How long? - About a week. - I'm gonna give you something. Take one of these for five days. - Okay. - How you doing otherwise? - Physically and mentally, tired. Emotionally, I'm a mess. - Yeah, ups and downs are normal. - I'm a lotta things, but normal isn't one of them. - How you doing with your parents? - Take a guess. I'm sleeping on a friend's couch and they're on the verge of disowning me. They'd rather keep up their perfect image for church than to deal with me. - Yeah, they can be that. You understand? Look, I don't know how to put this, Rorry, but I care about you. We all care about you. I'm just gonna be direct. You have options and you're very young. - There are no other options. This is my baby and I am keeping it. - You don't even know who the father is. - How could you say that? I hate men! - Brandon! Hey. Come have a cup of coffee with me. So where have you been staying? - Friend's. - And they don't have a shower? Look, I'm sorry. Look, I'm worried about you, but I shouldn't have to worry about you because you're my strong brother. Right? - Sure, Gemma. - Well, that doesn't sound very reassuring. - Look, what do you want me to say, huh? That there is no friend? That I sleep in my truck every night? Do you have any idea what it means to be AWOL? I see Tim's face in my nightmares every single night. - There's not a day that goes by that I do not think about him. But he's gone. And at some point we need to accept that and move on. Look, Brandon, it's not your fault. I think you need to turn yourself in. You need to be tough and get through this, and I'll be there to support you. - So high and mighty. Look, I'm out of here. - No, wait, Brandon, wait. Take it. - But you said that I could play the game when we get home after I did all my chores. - But how many chores did you do? - Two. - How many chores do you have? - I have two chores. - Which are? - I have dishes and dogs. - Dishes and d... what about dusting? That means do all of them, not just two, and you've been having the same chores for like four years. - But this isn't fair because I already did 'em. - For four years! - No. - Four years, dude, seriously. - No, I already did all my chores so I get to play the game when we get home. - Whatever. - Yep. - We'll see. - Yeah, we'll see. I get... - But I'm at the point financially that I can't afford to keep it though. - Okay, covered area. - So I had to say goodbye to that. - Yeah! - Frantically tried before to find my wife. - Where was she? - Okay. - Oh, my God! - TV wife who went for walk. - Welcome to the how honesty, open mindedness, willingness meeting. My name is Brett and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Brett. - This is an open meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, all who would care to, please join me in the serenity prayer. - God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen. - It's amazing. The obsession's been lifted. My name is Scott, I'm an alcoholic, and that's enough outta me. - Thank you, Scott. - Thank you, Scott. - How about you? - I'm Keith. - Hi, Keith. - I'm not really sure if this is for me. I've been to a few meetings, uh... I really like your shares. And my wife of 22 years is... She's dying of cancer. So it's been pretty tough. So maybe I'm kinda trying to numb the pain. About a month ago I got pulled over one night. Let's just say I wasn't sober. So I'm dealing with that, and my lawyer said I need to go to AA meetings, so here I am. - Thanks, Keith. - Welcome, Keith. - And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. Keep coming back, it works if you work it. - Nice meeting you. - I'll see you tomorrow, huh? - Yes, I'll be here! - Are you sure? - Yeah. - I've seen this story before. - No, very good. Thank you. - Card to sign. - Get well card. If you ever need anyone to talk to my number's on the back. - Uh, thanks. - I know it must be tough. The cancer. My mom had it. - She pass away? - Yeah. - Hi, how are ya? - Fine, thank you. - We got a nice night here tonight, huh? - Si, nice. - I'm Jerry. - Hi, Jerry. I'm Lupe. - Lupe. - Lupe. - Nice to meet you, Lupe. Lupe, I used to be a civil engineer over there. - Oh. Don't work there now? - No, no. - Where you work? - Uh, it's been about 12 or 13 years, you know. - Where you work? - I work on the streets now, I panhandle. Beg for money. - You? - Yeah. - Why? - You know. Sorta got mad with the world, you know? Got angry, didn't care anymore. You know? - I get mad at the world, too. - Yeah. - But then I know I am lucky to live in America. - That's a good attitude, Lupe. - Still mad at the world? - Me? No, no. I'm a happy guy now. - That's good. - No, I'm okay, I'm all set, honey. Thank you. -, it's coming. - Bus is coming? - Yeah. - Let me help you with your bags, honey. Here, let me help you. Come on. - Don't walk so fast, okay? - Okay. * The pain, yeah, yeah * That the pain, yeah * The pain, pain, pain - Are you serious? * Broken down, I'm awake now - Damn it! No, no, no, no. Come on, Uncle Keith, pick up. Please pick up. - Do it. - Yeah. - Here's to success. - Yeah, I figured you're the same thing. * Please just say * I'm not your man - So, you ready for another one? - Uh, sure, Kevin. - Yeah. - There you go. So, you still in the Army? - Sure, yep. - On leave or something? - AWOL. - AWOL? Oh shit. Here, this one's on me. - Thanks, Kevin. - Who's in the picture? - It's my brother, Tim. Took this in the backyard at Mom and Dad's right when I got back from deployment. - How's he doing? - He killed himself. - Sorry to hear that, brother. * Quieter since you left us * Fell asleep * Want to be a father - Come on, dog, shoot it! - What's up now, punk? Time to pay up. - Drinks on you then, fool. - Whatever, man. I gotta take a piss. - Yeah, me too. - He's hot. - That's a bad idea. * Please just say - It'll be fine. Hey. I'm Jeanie. - Hey. - What's your name? - Brandon. - You look tense, Brandon. - Yeah, I am. - Oh. Cute. You know, I do massage for a living. - Right. - You should call me. I'll give you a discount. - Oh yeah? - Nah, homie, drinks are on you. Drinks are on you, fool. - Hey. - Yo, Kenny Loggins. I need four shots over here, yeah? - Did you make some money, baby? - Damn straight, you know how I do. - Nice. - All right. - To hustlin'. - To hustlin'. - Yo, this guy's got your girl's card, buddy. - What? Why does this fool have your card? - I don't know. - What's up, bro? - Not interested. - I didn't ask if you were, homie. - Oh, this guy's got a boyfriend. What's up, what? Jeanie, come over here and help me up. Come on, come on. - You okay, Brandon? - Yeah. Look, I'm sorry, Kev. I gotta get outta here. - I hate those stupid guys. - There's the joker right there, man. That's what you get for messing with JT! - Come on. Come on, let's roll. - Jesus. Oh, hey. Oh, what happened? Do you want me to call 911 here? - No, no, I'm fine. - What happened? Are you all right? Man. Here. You want me to get you to a hospital or something? - No, I'm good. - You might have a concussion, that thing don't look too good. Here, here, I got some water. How about some water? Here, drink some water. I'll tell ya what, I'm just gonna sit right here for a minute and make sure you're all right. I'm Jerry. - Brandon. - What, did you get into a bar fight? - Yeah. - Yeah. I've been in a few of those myself. That's why I don't drink in the bars over there no more. Especially that one over there. Place is going downhill, let me tell ya. Anything broken? - I don't know, maybe a rib. I've had one broken before. - Having a rough one there, huh, kid? - Definitely having one of those days, man. Who am I kidding? One of those years. - Sounds like you've joined the club. - That's it, huh? Jerry, right? - Yeah, Jerry, yep. - You a veteran, Jerry? - No, no. How about yourself? - Yeah. - Thank you for your service. - You're welcome. I was deployed to Afghanistan. - Wow. - I had to kill four Al Qaeda and one kid. A kid with a gun. I'm telling you this, Jerry, 'cause I have a question for you. - Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot. - If a man takes another man's life, can he ever find redemption? Is this karma inescapable? - Well, killing in war is different. - Oh, they say that but it's not true. - I believe it lies within a man's heart when he kills in war and only you can know that. You survive and then you're alive and now you're home. - Yeah, I survived. I survived. I'm not alive. Yeah, come on, kid, sure you are, you're sitting right here. - You ever lose anyone close to you, Jerry? - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, quite a few. - I had a brother who just blew his head off. - Oh, sorry to hear that. - I hate the Army for driving him to do it! - I don't blame you, pal. - And myself for not being there. - Now, look, Brandon, here. I want you to have something, here. - I can't. - No, no, no, really. Come on, you must take this. I can't explain it now, but I think that'll help ya. Really. Yeah, go ahead. - All right. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Sure. - You seem like a really nice guy, Jerry. - That's a pretty new thing for me. You gonna be all right, kid? - Yeah, I'll be all right. - You sure? - Yeah, thanks for this. - By the way, what time you got over there? Take it easy, huh? - Hey, honey. You just call the office? Yeah, I know, I'm just... I'm just gonna do a few more files and go home. How was chemo? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let me write it down. Okay. Uh... It was... what was it? Skywalker OG Kush, that's a new one. I can pick it up at the same dispensary? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no, Chinese sounds awesome. I love you. - Hi. - Hi. Are you having car trouble? - I ran out of gas. - Do you have a container? - No. - Well, I do. A young lady like you shouldn't be hitchhiking. - What other choice do I have? And I have mace. - Okay. Get in. - Thanks. - There's a gas station a couple miles up the road. - Great, thanks. - You're welcome. Well, it's a little chippy out. - Yeah. My name's Rorry. - Hi, Rorry. I'm Charlie. - I've never ran out of gas before. Or hitchhiked. - Do you have AAA? - I don't have my card on me. - Hey, are you all right? - What? What? - Just lay back, lay back. I've got you. Come on. - '63 Barracuda? - It's actually a '65. You know your cars? - A little bit. I used to work on cars with one of my uncles. This one is in great condition. - Thanks. - Do you mind if I ask you something, Charlie? - Go for it. - Are you religious? - I practice spirituality in honor of all religions. - That's cool. I'm not religious or spiritual. My mother married this Evangelical pastor who I know is a total fake. - What makes you say that? - He's just not genuine. You seem genuine, Charlie. Do you know what I'm talking about? - I do. - He's completely manipulating her. She's a different person now. I have my own issues going on. I got pregnant from a one night stand and they kicked me out. They said I was an abomination to God. Isn't that nice? - I'm sorry to hear that, Rorry. Human beings and religion has developed a theory that fear maintains obedience more than love. People see what they wanna see. You look at a painting and you see a peaceful island, palm trees blowing in the breeze. Your parents see a desolate island with a storm coming. - I feel like I know you. You don't go to my parent's church, do you? - No, I do not. - You know, we're both very lucky. No broken bones, no internal bleeding. You had a bruised rib and I stitched up that left eye. What were you doing in the middle of the road? - I... I don't know. Well, earlier in the night I got into a fight with a couple guys at the bar. They beat me up pretty bad. There was this old man. Jerry. He helped me. I was driving and I got tired so I pulled over and passed out. Then I started having these vivid flashbacks. It's weird. I can't quite explain it, but something's different. - What do you mean? - Something's different about me. I remember looking at this wristwatch. It was darkness. It was evil. Then a white light came. I think I saw my brother. - Was this before I hit you? - Yeah. - That's interesting. Sounds like your life flashed before your eyes. Well, glad you're okay. I'm gonna go to my office next door. If you need anything, let me know. There's a bathroom down the hall and you can leave whenever you want to. I guess we're lucky, Brandon. - Do you have kids, Charlie? - You're all my kids. - Is that a yes or a no? - Yes. I'm a father, grandfather, and a great grandfather. - I never met my real dad. I've seen pictures. Now I'm carrying this baby from some Navy guy who I probably will never see again. I guess my biggest fear is this baby's gonna grow up not knowing who its father is. Like I never knew who mine was. - Rorry, has anyone ever taught you about the two basic fears that we, as humans, have to deal with? - No, what are they? - One is the fear of losing what you already have, and the fear of not getting what you want in the future. - I like that. - Fear and faith cannot exist within the same thought. Try replacing the fear-based thoughts with the faith-based thoughts. I will have a beautiful baby and I deserve a wonderful man in my life. - That just sounds like I'd be lying to myself. - No, no, no. Fear is the lie. I believe something good is coming your way. Try to believe. - Goodnight, Charlie. - Rorry? I wanted to give you something. I want to give you the four basic things of life. Something to do, something to look forward to, something to give, and someone to love. Remember this, dear. - Thank you, I'll never forget that. Bye, Charlie. Thank you, Charlie. - Yeah, I'll be there shortly, honey. I... You know what? I gotta go. Come in! You okay? - Yeah, um. You're right, Doctor. We are lucky. But I do think it was more than just a coincidence that our paths crossed. - Yeah, maybe. - I told you about the old man who helped me in the parking lot of the bar, right? - Yeah, you did. - He gave me something. He gave me this wristwatch. - Okay. - And I think I'm supposed to give it to you. - Uh, I appreciate the gesture, Brandon. I have several wristwatches. You should keep it. - No. It's yours now. Do what you want with it, but I can't leave with it. Thanks again, Dr. Phillips. - Take care, Brandon. - You, too. Gemma, it's your brother. Your strong brother. I just wanted you to know I turned myself into the Army. I don't know what's gonna happen, but I know it's the right thing to do. I love you and I'll be in touch. - Come on, Uncle Keith, pick up. Please. - Rorry? - Brandon? What are you doing here? - I was in an accident. - Oh my God, are you okay? - Yeah, no, this doctor, he... It's complicated. - My uncle's a doctor in there. - Gray goatee? Doctor Phillips? Whoa. - That's my uncle. - Um, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee? - I'd love to. I just have to go get something first. - Okay, yeah, um. I'll be right here. - Uncle Keith? - Rorry. I'm so glad you're here. Come in, come in. I'm so so sorry for the hurtful things I've said. I'm so glad you're here. - Uncle Keith, what's going on? - Nothing, nothing at all. - I think I left my wallet here. - You did. You did. I got it. - Yes that's it. - Rorry, there's something else I wanna say, too. Besides being sorry, I want you to know your Aunt Karen is gonna pass away soon and I've been lost and I didn't think I could go another day without her. I didn't wanna go another day without her. And then I realized that there's a better place, that we all have a better place. - I've never heard you talk like this. - I've never heard me talk like this. And I got something I wanna give ya. It's for you. - What am I gonna do with this? It looks like an old man's watch. - Nah. - I won't wear it. - Yeah, you will. It's unisex. - Did you just say unisex? - Yeah, I did say it, I'm a doctor. I can say unisex. You'll wear it. And I want you to go see your OBGYN. - I will. Uncle Keith. - Yeah? - You're gonna make a great great uncle. - Okay, that makes me feel old. Get outta here. - Rorry? - Dad?
