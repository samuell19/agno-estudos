[MICHAEL] When I walk into my basement,my archives... A lot of history in those boxes... A lot of journeys anda lot of work. Most of it required big negatives. Huh... Because we useda view camera with a cloth. Here's a perfect example. This is Orson Welles, 1985. This is the size of the negative. It was near the end of his life. Orson was leavingthe studio and he was in a wheelchair at that point.And in the loft building, in Los Angeles, I waslooking down the staircase, and a shaft of lightwas coming in and illuminating Orson in his wheelchairlooking at the door, and I didn't have the courageto make the photograph and intrude on his life. So that picture exists here,and it never goes away. Never. Orson. I try to... [long breath] Be an equal. Even for those few minutes, it's just I'm a human being and the subject is a human being. And if the two of us collaborate together because we want to make something special, then we have a great portrait. If there's resistance onone side and negativity, it slows down the processand the picture becomes, or the photograph, becomesmore ordinary. So how do you connectinstantaneously? [whispering] Scorsese, let's find Scorsese. I guess Martin is hidingin here. (lower voice)Where's "Martin?". "Martin". [long breathing] Look at "Martin"all these years ago. Well, and here's Martin,he's acting, look at that. So he is giving me that. He's playing the actor. Boy, is he there... This is a great picture. I haven't looked at this one in years,but I think this is great. Because it's not perfect,because it's moving and flawed. And there is a RichardNixon down there. Ok, who else? I actually photographed Paul Newmana whole bunch of times. I think this is what they usedto cover "The Times". He looks like the hero,doesn't he? Here was the picture we wantedto use at "The Times", but the editor wouldn'tlet me use it. This was my favoritepicture of Paul, for the cover. So he would go andhe would play, and that would makethe great portraits. You see his eyes? I love this picture. I think they thoughtthey didn't see enough of him to know it was Paul Newman.

So these are very earlyphotographs from the Himalayans, the Tibetan border in the 70's,in 1979. 1979. It's a flawed photograph,but if you look at the monastery in the lowerright hand corner, you realize the enormityof the mountains.

And that's what Yoga does, that's why this Yoga studio is so full. Because the Yoga studiogives a person direct experience of their own inner light.And it lights that fire for them. Then, there's a direct linetowards wherever that person is, and infinite consciousness. Of course, infinite consciousness resides within anyway. But we're usually taken out to journey to make the inner connection. But in that sense, Yoga is not aligned to religious practice in the same kind of way. it's much more informal.

Because so many peoplethese days have seen religion, and have seenthose who spouse religion behaving in ways thatthey don't consider religious, they don't consider spiritual, and we're all trying to make sense of these new times. It's interesting to note the difference in approach between western philosophyand eastern philosophy. So, western philosophyis essentially an academic pursuit: discussion,written work, exposition, more discussion.

Then, it can be better or it can be worse. But, really, we'll find the only thing I can change is myself. ♪ So words are not necessary. Words only go to the five senses, as that much can you talk about, and can you think about. You have to go above the five senses. That's where reality sits, that's where truth is. And you can't talk about it, but can feel it, you can see it. ♪ Very often, I just sit and try to kind of look deeper and deeper, and thoughts come. And every time thoughts come,stop them, stop them. There are so manydifferent kinds of meditations, but I find it, for me, that it's beenvery helpful, stopping these... Not thinking as all thinking,but that kind of internal, the duality conversation onehas with oneself, that thinking... You're so used to chatwith yourself and you decide “Yes”, “No”,“I don't like that” and “Should I do that?”,“Do it like that”. It's like two people,that thinking... But the thinking of contemplationand of widening yourself. You know? That begets much morespace then for that. If you stop that kindof planning and... Planning one has to do. But the extra dreaming andfantasizing and all that... That is the thinking to stop, not the one that bringsyou further and further. ♪ [UMA] And that heightens awareness. The awareness that so the common man don't have because they don't try to find it. It's there, but you have to go above the five senses and above the material world in order to see the truth. Once you're there, you realize that “Gosh, we are all just human beings”. But until you get to that point that you are important, and that one is bad, and that one is great, and that one is silly, and that one is rich, and that one is poor... Finally, when you go above the five senses, that kind of thinking, intellectual thinking... Then you see that it's just one thing.

We need that union through Yoga, not mere bending over. Because Yoga is not a 45 minutes class. Yoga is not only on the mat. Yoga is off the mat. Every minute, every moment, every karma, every thought, every action, every breath is Yoga. Yoga is what you are. ♪ Life is wherever you are,every moment. It's not the “Tomorrow,I'll be happy. Maybe in the future,after ten years, I'll be ok, I'll be great,I'll feel happy”. This is the time, now. If you don't feel happy now,you will never be happy. Now is the time. You are the mantra. You are the mantra. [MICHAEL] We were on the edgeof the Ganges in Haridwar, and we had stoppedby a cremation pyre. And we askedif I could photograph, and I was trying to make imagesnot really knowing what I was doing.And somebody came over to me and sort of whispered that the man was watchinghis child being cremated, his son had died. [crackling fire noise] [MICHAEL] I wrote about this photograph and said: “A father watches his sonbeing cremated at the side of the Ganges in Haridwar. The temple, quote/unquote ‘body' burns and releases the individual soul back into the universal soul”. The saying from the classicBuda's lore is: “I will give you a boat to cross the river, but you must leave it on the other side and continue on”. ♪ [MICHAEL] The longer I'm involved in this journey, the more I realize that my Yoga has evolved into a means of letting go and surrendering to change, passage, death, to move away from fear, to the fears that binds us. ♪ ♪ [JAGADISH] (foreign) Why is people scared of death? This is a deep question. A Saint who used to livenearby Gangotri, wanted to leave his body to God. He always says: “I want to sacrifice my body”. One night, it was late,and started to snow. At 3am, he started feeling cold. In my experience is aroundthis time, the heat of fire is not enough to keep us warm. Around 3am he was cold and said: “God, please save me tonight”. Now this is the answer to your question:"what is the fear of death?" I was angry and amusedat the same time. I said: “On one side you are waitingto sacrifice your body but now you are asking God to save your life?” People have the fear of death: “I don't want to leave my body”. This fear of death can't be explained in words. It can only be felt by the person who is facing death. One never accepts the factthat one day everyone will die. This is the illusion thatwe have about death. This is the biggest illusionhuman being have, that one day his life will notcome to an end. He tries all he can. But he never realizes thatone day his end will also come. [crackling fire noise] [WOMAN] This is the biggest misunderstanding in this life, in our life, is that we think that we will never die. ♪ ♪ ♪ [GURMUKH] You know, when people are old people at the Golden Temple... You'll see them around. They are muttering: “Wahe guru,wahe guru, wahe guru, wahe guru”. Why? Because they want to taketheir last breath on Waheguru. Like, going fromdarkness to the light. Waheguru is... Wahe is “wow”. Guru, “I'm going fromdarkness to light”. “I'm going to liberation”. And they say that so many peopleleave their last breath, like, in a hospital.And they use a swear word. Because they have doneno preparation. We know this is temporary.We know we've come to go. That's why we do meditationsout of the tenth gate, preparing to go home. So you go home with ease,you go home with grace. But if you don't have that tool,you hold on for life. You don't want to leave.You're in coma for years, you have all thatstuff more... “Keep me alive, put allthe tubes you can in me. I have to stay alive”, because a lotof people think that this is it. ♪ [MOOJI] At a certain stage, all that experience is beginning to creep in, which are not pleasant. It brings up some deeperquestions because we begin to senseour mortality, or the sense that maybe one day, we'll not be here. ♪ [MOOJI] But as you gomore inwardly, because for a while our experience,experiences, seem to be coming in from this sideof the eyes, from the outside. But gradually as we begin to discover more our inner being, we are finding that more... It's coming into a field of peace, and contentment, and a wider perspective of life. The sense of choosing one's life become less important. The sense of living life becomes less important, as you discover that you are life itself. It culminates in the end of the sense of separateness, of me and the whole, of me and God, of me and truth... It's like “me” gets merged into the greater, the greater consciousness. ♪ [MOOJI] Then you can see from this place, because it's there already,it is what you are fundamentally. This is the only space thatthere is in you, that doesn't belong to time. Everything else is of time. Everything that you perceiveis of time. Because this is the only place in you that is not coming upright, it is your internal nature. [gong] [LINDA] If we really boil it down, fear is the fear of death. I mean... That's out big fear in life. And you may put a lot of otherpoints in front of it, but really it's fear of death. So, once we master the fear of death,then we are free. It is in this understanding of fearthat we no longer have fear. We move forward, and when our time comes, we're ready. Because at that timeyou can't go back, you're going forward,and you are letting go of all fear. And trusting what you'vedone all your life. So, it is our opportunityto be free. I believe that's why we are here,it's to learn that. So, it's kind of funny,we are born to learn how to die. ♪ [LINDA] At the end of the day, we are all going to leave this planet or this body as we know it. But it's in those last breaths of our life that we... If we are in consciousness, that we can take that consciousness with us and move forward to our next journey. ♪ [MICHAEL] So, look, death is scary. It is just as scary for meas it is for you, for all, for everybody. It's just simply the experienceof being with yourself, of being with your breath. [long breath] I mean, it isn't that it takes away the fear of death, it just makes sense of death, because it's a moment of transition. If there is an energy,and there is a spark, and we believe in it… All we are leaving behindis a body. ♪ What is going to go with us is our experiences. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [EDIE] I think a lot of it is taking that little time during the day to address those partsof us that we can't see. Huh? We spend a lot of timetaking care of our bodies. And feeding our bodies,and dealing with e-mails and the world around us... All the things thatwe can see and measure. Then, we need some timeto take care of those things, or be with those things we can't see,like our breath... Or the feeling of quietingthe mind. Or the feeling of maybe meditating on compassion, or on contemplation on God, contemplation on consciousness, contemplation on love... All these things that we can't see and we can't measure. And so in the Yoga practices and in meditation, that's a lot of the world that we're in. We're in the world of things that can't be measured. ♪ To be in that space without measuring stuff and trying to figure stuff out for a little while, because there is no“figuring it all out”. We can all figure it out upto a certain point. Then, the thing we figured out,well, it might change. Or there will be somethingelse to try to figure it out. This is where the ideaof surrender comes in. To know the limits of how far we can get on our own steam, and at what point do we have to give up, and have the faith and confidence that something else is going to help us along. ♪ [EDIE] There're a lot of people meditating. There're a lot of people doing something like Yoga, a lot of people going to church. So there must be some drive in us, in all human beings, which leads us towards, contemplating, or praying, or worshiping, or being quiet, in one way or another. ♪ [EDIE] Aristotle and Plato and, you know, Jain monks, and the Yogis, they all question, they all contemplate it. Some of them left society so they couldcontemplate this sense. This has been going on forthousands of years. it's not new for us to be doing this. It's part of us to be doing this. ♪ ♪ I don't think that there really will benecessarily a better something. Huh... A better world,a more peaceful world. And it's not that I'm somekind of a fatalist or something, but it seems like there has always been a lot of violence in the world. There has always been political people. There has always been financial problems and financial crisis, up to anywhere there has always been something, which has been either famine, a scourge, a plague, a terrible king, overrun by foreign countries coming inand destroying everything… This has been going on for a long time and we're no different. But there's always been some smallgroups of people who will say: “I don't want to take partin this kind of way, and so I'm going to try tobe a kinder person, a more thoughtful person. I'm going to think aboutthe world that I live in. I'm going to think aboutmy actions in the world. And I'm going to tryto be more loving”. And there has always been some small groups of people throughout the ages andthroughout time who have decided to do this. The Yogis are one of those groups, and their longevity, in terms of the practice staying alive, has been remarkable. ♪ The practice of Yoga might look a little bit different now, but the idea behind it is essentially the same. I don't want to take part in the world in the same way that I see it causing a lot of suffering to people. I want to take part in the world in such a way that it creates more happiness, more kindness, more thoughtfulness, more care. So we need that quiet time to experience those things. It just serves to make our life a little bit more stable, and make our perception a little bit more clear, and give us a greater appreciation that everyone around us is also going through that same struggle. ♪ [MICHAEL] In Tibet, ten years ago I wasat Milarepa's Cave, and it was June, but there was a snow storm blowing up the valley. This cave was at the topof a valley. The group of people I waswith went into the cave, but somehow I walked awayand I found a gigantic slab of stone, a flat stone, parched,at the top of the valley. And I sat and meditated in, you know, in rain gearand cold weather gear, while the snowflakes blew upthe valley, and tinkled... On my clothing and in my eyes, and I sat there for an hour. And that meditation andwhatever spirit was there, and whatever aura was there, that's going with me when I go. No one can takethat away from me. No one can take that away from you,your experiences.
