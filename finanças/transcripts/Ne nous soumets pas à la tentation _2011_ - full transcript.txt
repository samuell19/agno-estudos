LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION Who's on the case? He's a friend. I'll call him myself. Of course. Yes, Isabelle? We need to move the case. Sorry? Thanks. What the heck? There's a problem here at the exit. Can you move? - Move your scooter! - It's broken! Move it, get on the sidewalk! There's a problem. Can you move your scooter? Can you help me? Not you, Isabelle. Can you take me to a garage? I'm stuck, I don't know anyone. I'm busy. Sorry. Please, can't you take me to a garage? Fine, get in. No, it's a broken down scooter. Isabelle, I'm on the road. Get Richard to sign. The registrar sent the bill on. Of course, we can't change the terms at all. Not at all. I'll dictate it later. Can you reserve a table for me at the Terrasse tonight? 9pm. Perfect. I'll call you back. It's snowing. May I have a cigarette? Open the window, please. Thanks. Were you on a business trip? Airports aren't just for those who travel. They're for those who watch others travel. Wise men. This car's really quiet. It's comfortable. You know the Dyane? A little. - Really? - The vintage car. Not the ZCV, the Dyane? With my cousins, we used to pile in the Dyane. In the afternoon, we'd go cherry picking. We'd fill up the crates... That's the Dyane, for me. The smell... Sometimes Grandpa Charles would have us drive. That's how I learned to drive. - Does this car go fast? - A little. You like to go fast? There's always a speed limit. Yeah, but... Don't you like to go fast? No faster than recommended. I love to go fast. It's right there. - What? - The closest garage. Thank you so much. Tristan Fisher. - Thanks, Tristan. - You're welcome. Isabelle? I can't talk right now. Right, I'm in a meeting. It's the least full. - Cheers? - Cheers. - Not bad? - A little young. So tell me, are you happy to be back in the house? I really am. Far... from the hustle and bustle of Geneva. It's such a pleasure, how peaceful the house is. A pleasure to see you too. It's been ages. What...? Two...? Three. Three years? That long? You're right. It was before I redecorated. It's been three years. I'm very good with dates. I believe you. That's Rachel. Totally Rachel. All's fine in Geneva, then suddenly, it's over. Time to change. Everything changes. She's hard to follow, but... you have to make do. But you followed her nevertheless. I'll follow her to the end. I should be going. - You sure? - I'm a little tired. Forgive me if I don't finish. No worries. Don't be such a stranger this time. Let's not wait another three years. - See you soon. - Drive carefully. I like your new decor. - I do. - Not bad, is it? The colors are warm. That's true. I'm going now. Is that you? Where are you going? Apparently, there's a bus stop nearby. What happened? When we went to the garage, I left everything in my scooter trunk. Money, papers, telephone... When I got back, it was all gone. I'm really sorry. What do you plan to do? Sleep. I'm a little tired. Get in. It's big! Is it all in wood? With a nice guest bedroom. After you. Student? That's right. What are you studying? Not much. I don't go a lot. I don't like it. Those things happen. Any idea what you'd like to do later on? Travel. Who's that? My wife. Rachel. Where is she? On a trip. In Switzerland on business. That's why I was at the airport. So it's thanks to her we met. You could say that. Thank her for me. I'll be sure to. The guest room's over here. My name's Anna. Good night. Good night, Anna. I swear, it's the last time. I'm up shit creek. He left me at the airport with a broken scooter You know I can't go to my aunt's. Come on, I have nowhere to go. Stupid jerk! How are you? I guess I should be asking you. I made coffee. Want some? If you need anything, I could help. Actually, if it's not too much, maybe you could spot me the cash to fix my scooter? I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Thank you. Thank you. Perfect. Sugar? For the bill... It's nothing. Just a dirty spark plug. I want to thank you. Why? To do something nice for you. What do you think would be nice for me? I've got an idea, but I'll need some money. 15 is enough. It's not a trick, you'll see me again. Even if I didn't see you again, it wouldn't matter. That's not nice. I mean you can do what you want with the money. I always do what I want. See you back at the house? I'm a little bored. How many more days? Alright, kisses. Lots of love. Kisses. Goodbye. Can I have another piece? - It's huge. - No, it's not. You like it. Cheers. How did you make it? It's my secret. Do you have lots of secrets? No more than you. I don't have any. Old Swiss family. Protestant. Three brothers. Minister's son. And a job... that pays. It's my wife's house. I'm just a teeny tiny lawyer. You have any kids? I've always found ministers sexy. They've got that uptight thing you want to loosen up. Good lord... I can just imagine... you in front of my father. What am I like? Talk about me. Alive! Let's toast... to the living! To the living! Did you look? At the time, I dreamed of starting a rock band, an innovative one. Really? Why didn't you? I asked myself that, a hell of a... What? - I'm asking you. - I don't know. You could still do it. It's not too late. Hope is essential for survival. It's like the illusion of choosing your destiny. It lets you advance... advance towards... Towards the end. Advance? I ask you, advance towards what? Advance towards death, towards nothingness. Advance towards nothingness to a rock tune. I'm hot. I don't feel well. Hot? So am I! - You OK? - Excuse me... What are you doing? What's wrong? I'm going to lie down. I don't think... What? That it's a good idea? Time for regrets? I told you, I'm very predictable. What does it change? Not much. This has never happened before. Never You made love to me like a little virgin. I'm sorry. It's kind of the truth. You smell nice. Has it been long since you and your wife...? Can't we talk about it? Well? Don't you want her anymore? Or does she not want you? How long has it been? Too long. I was out. I went to the store. How's your work going? That's great. You must be happy. Still coming home in 2 days? Good. Why do you say that? I'm just out of breath. Call me with your flight number. I'll come pick you up. Lots of love. Kisses. That was my wife. We're stopping here. Should I go? Alright. Anna, listen. I love my wife. I didn't promise anything. - You knew. - Yeah. You miss her that much? I miss her. Just keep me for 2 days. Come here. - That would suit you! - I think I have it. It's kind of flashy. I really like... You don't like flashy. Your look is serious. Absolutely. I used to wear my mother's clothes a lot. I'd wear her high heels. I was a real knockout. - My mom was very elegant. - I believe it. I'd fall, obviously. I like... I like... This one's nice! Sold. I'll wait outside. I don't know, maybe 11:00. How's that? I'd prefer 11:30 or 11:45. I'll make do. - Ever hit on a girl that way? - Never. It's lame. - Making hotcakes? - Exactly. Then we'll make them even hotter That's not allowed! I won't let you. I'm begging you! What's wrong? Not like this! Make your hotcakes. - Don't spank me. - Make your hotcakes. - No! - No what? Get your revenge, little rooster! Before, in the country, we had huge fireplaces where the whole family fit. Everyone. Grandpa, grandma, the kids, the dogs. Everyone. And sometimes, the old folks fell asleep. It was so nice. They'd nod right off. Now, there are these tiny fireplaces. We're going to need more... logs. Can you go get a couple? - I can't. I'm barefoot. - Where? Outside, under the bench. My toenails... I'm Anna. Tristan's niece. Your house is really cool. We're making a fire in the fireplace. See you in a bit. Which one is it? Which one what? Which of your brothers is missy's father? Paul. It's Paul. I thought I'd already told you. You should have called. I thought it was tomorrow. Gorgeous. What was that story? You should have seen your face. I had to do something. Is that how you work? You should be thanking me. Uncle. She's just a little girl, who's kind of lost. I always loved your generosity. I'd like to watch a film tonight. If you want. I want you to know... I'm really glad you're back home. Really. I've seen enough. You can already guess how it's going to end. Goodnight. I'll come with you. Goodnight, Anna. What's wrong? I'm nauseated. Want me to get you something? I just need to digest your niece's cooking. It's pretty heavy. Goodnight. What are you looking for? The next flight to Geneva. You're not leaving us already? - Can I help? - No thanks. I miss you. I understand. - She gives you what I no longer do. - Stop. You're the only thing that matters to me. Excuse me. Can I have some more? Not bad. What is it? Nothing. I was wondering what your childhood was like. My mother died when I was 11. Car crash. Took her 3 days to die. How awful. For my dad, it was quicker. Found him in the bathroom with a bottle of pills. Sorry? He loved her too much. Couldn't bear losing her. Last I heard, my brother was quite well. I mean the guy who raised me. And you? How did you meet? It's unoriginal. At some friends', 7 years ago. What attracted you the most to Rachel? Everything. Her fragility, sensitivity, honesty. All her qualities that make an exceptional woman. You're living a real fairy tale. They got married, but didn't have any kids. Didn't you ever want any? Excuse me... I'm going to get my jacket. You don't miss a beat. - What? - That's not nice, what you did. What'd I say? She can't have children. It's our cross to bear. I didn't know. You're pushing it to the limit. How could I know? I'm not hungry anymore. Still leaving tomorrow? It's best. I don't think so. You shouldn't go. I'm going out a bit. Leave the door open downstairs. I don't have the keys. Goodnight. Have fun? What are you doing up? What about you? Where were you all night? I met some boys in a bar and it lasted longer than planned. Felt good to get some air. - What's that on your lip? - Nothing. An accident. What do you want here? I love my wife. I'll never leave her. Why stay? I'm crazy about you, don't you get it? I don't love you. I never did and never will. Now get out of here! Stop it. That's not funny. Get your foot off! I missed my plane. That's good. I'm glad. It's for the best. You should change your pants. Open the door. Open the damn door! Perfect. Perfect. I want them on my desk Monday. See with him. Early in the week. I'm getting cigarettes, need anything? I'd also like to have all the cases in the courts or awaiting trial and a recap of requests for appeal. Thanks. I'll call you back. Rambo, come talk to me! Absolutely. Those aren't threats. It's for his own good. Listen, it'll go to the supreme court then. We're not letting some crook exploit us. Thank you. See you Monday. Are you going back to Geneva? Isabelle, it's me. Can you reserve a table for three? Monday, at the Fountain Park. Perfect. Check the schedule for the rest. Thanks. I'll call you back. I need to talk to you. I don't want to hear it. It's about me going, that should interest you. In my room in 5 minutes. Don't go imagining... It's not what you think. It's pathetic. I'm not the one who should leave! Get out now! You don't love her anymore! Or you wouldn't make love to me that way! Stop! You're nothing compared to her! You hear me? Nothing! What if I told her everything in detail? She'd love it. What do you know? She knows it anyway. I'll give her the details. Get lost! Don't throw me out! You can't abandon people like that! We need to go away. We need to leave here. We'll go anywhere you want. Gustavia. You'll forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. Look what we've become. It's too late now. It's over. It's broken! Move to the other side! Move your scooter! Can you help me? It's broken! Goodbye. La Terrasse, that's it! Pull over. That's perfect. Now we wait. Gotta trust him or he'll take off. I followed my wife too... Ever since... That's him! Go! - This is fine here. - There's nothing. Exactly. - Keep the change. - Thanks. - He doesn't know how lucky he is. - He will soon. Bye! - Need a ride? - No thanks. Where are you going? No thanks. You sure? - Does this lead to the Goupillére? - Yes. - Sure I can't take you? - Thank you. I fixed something for you. Thank you. Light. Turkey. Like some pickles? I'm fine. I swear, it's the last time. You know I can't go to my aunt's. Come on, I have nowhere to go. Alright, kisses. Lots of love. Kisses. Hi. I bought radishes. I know you like radishes. Did you miss me? It didn't cross my mind, but I guess a little. - Sure you don't need me? - I'm sure. Then it wouldn't be a surprise. - You OK? - No... Not really... Excuse me... My God... Anna, listen... I love my wife. I didn't promise anything. You knew. Yeah. Remember the last time you lied? Remember how you cried and all? How dramatic it was? Remember? It's a shame. I'm doing it for us, Stephan. So we can quit our little schemes. Usually we work together I wanted to make sure first, because this one's kind of special. A big money job. He's Swiss. I made him think I was his niece. How does he fuck? - What do you want to know? - Everything. He's not dumb. We'll need to play it subtle. You're very subtle. Swiss, of course. Those are good arguments. So? So give me a little time. Give me a little time... I'll give you 24 fucking hours. - Then we leave. - And then? - We leave! - We leave? - I'm doing it for us. - Sure. 24 hours. Don't play me for a fool. I know how twisted you are. - Why would I lie to you? - Why? Because you're a liar. That's why I love you. What's so funny? Do you love me? That's funny. Drink up. Just keep me for 2 days. I like being with you. How's it going? Get out of here. Not now! Think of the money we're making! Did you buy some panties? I don't know, maybe 11:00. How's that? Is that all? I'd prefer 11:30 or 11:45. Ever hit on a girl that way? It's lame. ...out in front of the terminal. I can't wait to get back home. Can you get my cigarettes? I left them in the car. I'm exhausted. Hi dear, ifs me. You're hard to reach. It's always voice-mail. Whatever... Tm coming home early. I get in this afternoon on the 3 o'clock flight. I couldn't find them. They're not there. What time is it now? 3:50. Why do you want to know? Who cares what time it is? We don't care! Anybody home? Hello. I'm Anna. Tristan's niece. Want me to get you something? I just need to digest your niece's cooking. It's pretty heavy. Goodnight. I was going to come get you. Hands off. How's your new novel coming? It's coming. Almost done. Can we read it? I already told you. - What? - Not until it's finished. Too bad. It might help it turn out better. Yes, dear. How's it going? Fine. Well? Don't touch that. What are you up to these days? What are you up to? Getting it off with an old Swiss? - Is that it? - Stop. I asked you a question. Answer me. What are you up to these days? You said a big job. A big sex job? I'm talking to you. Shut up and listen. Where's the money? Have you lost your touch? I'm waiting. What do you think I do all alone here? Fuck. Tell the truth. The truth is you're a little shit writer. Don't talk to me like that! Fuck you! - Quit messing with me. - Asshole! Stop moving! - I'm sick of this. - You turn up here... You start making fun of me right to my face. Wait. - What's that on your lip? - Nothing. An accident. What do you want here? I love my wife. I'll never leave her. Why stay? I'm crazy about you, don't you get it? I don't love you. I never will. Get out of here! Goodnight, uncle! - Hello. - Hello. The guy in room 24, is he out? - Are you Anna? - Yes. He went to Paris. He'll be back tomorrow. 0k, thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You scared me. You're like me. I had the same arrogance. I don't care about your stories. This has to stop. You need to leave. I don't agree. Tristan wouldn't agree. I think he really likes me. Can you also set up a meeting with Bormann. As soon as possible, early in the week. Thank you. I'm getting cigarettes, need anything? I'd also like to have all the cases in the courts, or awaiting trial, and a recap of all the requests... - What? You know her? - Why are you here? - What was that about? - You don't dare do it yourself? - What are you talking about? - You betrayed me, bitch! What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck away, move it! Get your fucking ass out of here! Get lost! Check the schedule. Thanks. I'll call you back. I need to talk to you. I don't want to hear it. It's about me going, that should interest you. In my room in 5 minutes. Get out! Get out of here! Tristan won't leave my room. He wants to make love but I don't. It's your turn tonight. Don't go imagining... It's not what you think. It's pathetic. Stop talking about him. You don't know anything. Why didn't you tell him the truth? What truth? The one you tell? The queen of lies! If Tristan only knew... Tell him, it doesn't matter now. What's going on between you and Stephan? Answer me when I talk to you! Why are you fucking up my life? You've done enough! - You stink of lies! - What's going on here? Nothing. - What's going on? - Nothing. Everything's fine. - What happened? - Nothing. - Have a good trip. - Thanks. Yes, Isabelle... I brought my wife to the airport. - Hello. - Hello. I'd like to cancel my ticket to Geneva. - Mrs Fisher? - That's right. - May I see some ID? - Yes. Shall I keep your reservation for Nice? Please. Welcome to the airport of Nice. I wasn't sure I'd see you again. It's been so long. I know you're disappointed she didn't come. I gave her your flight time when we last spoke. I gave her all the details. She's not easy. So tell me. What have you been doing all this time? - I opened a gallery in Geneva. - And Tristan? Fine. 'Fine'. As talkative as even Sure you won't come to the house? There's room. No thanks. I'll be fine. I'm not sure Jean's studio is very clean, I'm warning you. - It'll be fine for a few days. - Perfect. It'll be nicer than a hotel. Does she look like me? Does she have my face? More his. Didn't you see in the last photos? All these years, I never looked at a single photo. I kept them... I thought... not seeing her face would protect me. I thought... not seeing her, I wouldn't miss her. That's what I thought. Come on. Let's go. I'll take you to your castle. The studio's tiny, I'm warning you. Then we'll go to the house. He's a rather tidy boy, but he's still a boy. I'll open the window a bit. We haven't been here for awhile, of course it smells a little stale. He's trying to quit smoking, but it's not easy. There, that's better - It's small. - It's perfect. - Will it be OK? - Thank you. You've done so much for me. It's nothing. I'm so glad you're here. I missed you. You'll come over for dinner. Meet my husband. He is your brother-in-law. Not tonight, I'm tired. I'll call. Alright. Here. Her address. The last one she gave me. It's all I have. - I'm looking for Sarah. - What'd she do? - May I see her? - She's not here. Is there a message? Here's my card. With my number. Have her call me. It's important. Rachel Fisher. Who are you? Just say Rachel. She'll know. I'll tell hen If I see her, that is. What do you mean? I haven't heard from her in two days, so I'll tell her if I see hen Goodbye. Fine dear, how are you? Actually no. It's been hectic, I'm really busy. I'm in a meeting, I'll call you back? Do you miss me? Me too. A lot. Goodbye. I can be a good mother too! Sarah! Her first 2 years, I'd spend whole nights watching her sleep. I didn't know how long we had left. When she couldn't sleep, I'd play music. It would soothe her. She knew I was coming and she left. She didn't give me a chance. Wait a bit longer. It's been 2 days. It's no use. I'll go back tomorrow. I didn't want to tell you by email, it's been rough for her the past year. Especially since her dad died. She drinks, stays out late, she's with a con artist. Just like her father, the sick-in-the-head type. It's hard for kids to avoid their parents' mistakes. I'm sorry. That was wrong. It's OK. You're probably right. She loved her father. She looked after him until he died. Every day. Every day, he told her it was your fault, that you'd abandoned them, that you didn't want hen You understand? Give her a little time. You never told Tristan you had a daughter? So many lies, he'd never understand. I've lied so much. And for months now, I can't give myself to him. It hurts me, but I can't. His skin hurts me. I just can't anymore. Stop it. But he loves you... He loves what I told him. He's too honest to accept the truth. I was crazy to think her dad's death would change anything. Things never work the way we want them to. Never Hi dear, it's me. You're hard to reach. It's always voice-mail. Whatever... I'm coming home early. I get in this afternoon on the 3 o'clock flight. Let's meet like usual out in front of terminal F, by the entrance. I can't wait to get back home. I'm Anna. Tristan's niece. Dessert. Why didn't you give me any pineapple? Because you've always hated it. - How do you know? - You said so earlier I did? Are you still game for a film? Want some help? No thanks. Sarah? Tonight, you choose the film. It's your choice. My mother died when I was 11. Car crash. Took her 3 days to die. How awful. For my dad, it was quicker. Found him in the bathroom with a bottle of pills. Sorry? He loved her too much. Couldn't bear losing her. Last I heard, my brother was quite well. I mean the guy who raised me. Excuse me, I'm cold. I need my jacket. Be right back. - What's that on your lip? - Nothing. An accident. What do you want here? I love my wife. I'll never leave her. Why stay? I'm crazy about you, don't you get it? I don't love you. I never did, never will. Now get out of here! Paris Orly airport, passengers to Hong Kong, your flight has been delayed. Final call, passengers to Geneva, please report to gate 23 for immediate boarding. I missed my plane. That's good, I'm glad. It's for the best. You should change your pants. Open the door. Open the damn door! Why are you here? I knew something was fishy. You let her push you around? That's twisted. Look who's talking. But I love her. He's just having fun. - He's using her, like you. - I'm using her? Know what it's like living with her? Total hell! - If I didn't love her... - You call that love? You bully her, it's all you know. You don't know what goes on between us. Leave her alone now. She doesn't want to see you anymore. She said that? Listen, I had to leave it all because of a guy like you. I won't let her life be ruined like mine was. What? Is that a threat? You're scaring the piss out of me. If you come near us, I'll call the police. Is that clear? I've got your address, and the cops must know you. She never wants to see you again. Never. Got it? See you soon. Shut up. You don't know what we have. Why didn't you tell him the truth? What truth? The one you tell? The queen of lies! If Tristan only knew... Tell him, it doesn't matter now. What's going on between you and Stephan? He was so jealous. It was frightening. It made him increasingly violent. But he was so unhappy making me suffer. One night, I took you away. You were so little. When he found us, he made it very clear: if I did it again, he'd kill us both, and himself. He would have done it too. You could see it in his eyes. I realized I had to save my skin. And to save yours, I had to leave. You were safe, he adored you. I'm sure he was a wonderful father to you. I really loved him. I should have insisted, stood firm... Kidnapped you. I was so young. I was barely 16 when I had you, just a child myself. I was overwhelmed by it all. With Tristan too, I've been a coward. I didn't dare... I didn't dare ruin the image he had of me. I couldn't. Can you understand? Forgive me. I'm begging you, forgive me. I've waited my whole life to hear that. Hello, darling. Thought you could leave me? Don't believe her, I'm not leaving you. You think I can trust you? What are you talking about? I'm here now, I'll take care of it. - Where is that asshole? - Who? Your Swiss guy! Where is he? - It's time to cough up the cash! - Here's the plan: We drop it and go home. He fucks my girl and I'm supposed to let it go? You're hurting me! What the fuck? Where's the big job you promised? Shut up! Stop it!
