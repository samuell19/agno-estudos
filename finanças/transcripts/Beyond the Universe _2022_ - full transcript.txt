[dramatic music] [Nina] Somewhere in the universe, there's someone who's a hundred percent compatible with me. [spiritual music] The problem is finding this one person among the seven billion people living on planet Earth. And it's not that I'm a pessimist. It's just that, unlike most people, I didn't have that much time to look. But I found them. I started playing when I was eight years old. And at 13, I already knew I wanted to be a pianist in the Symphony Orchestra. [applause] [playing classical music] [faltering] [dramatic music] [gasping softly] [breathing heavily] [all gasp] But then my dream was devoured by a wolf. [wolf howling] Allow me to explain. "Lupus" means "wolf" in Latin. It's an autoimmune disorder. It's like my body is attacking itself. It can attack my skin. My organs. Sometimes it attacks my joints. Oh no, but how can you play the piano like this? [door opens] Honey, you gotta rest a little. I will, Grandpa. What else is there to say? I've learned to deal with it, and just hope this wolf doesn't get... ...your kidneys. Your kidney function has fallen below ten percent, Nina. The solution now is a kidney transplant. And until we're able to get the transplant, you'll be needing hemodialysis three times a week. Through an AV fistula in your arm. [monitors beeping faintly] How long will I be on the waitlist? [Simone] It could be as little as six months. Or up to a few years, Nina. It depends on the waiting time. Today, your current placement on the waitlist is written here. POSITION ON ACTIVE WAITLIST: 14,890 [Nina sniffles] [ominous music] ONE MONTH LATER [device chimes] ♪ Who knows I might still be a little girl ♪ ♪ Waiting for the school bus by herself ♪ ♪ Tired, with knee-high socks ♪ ♪ Quietly praying around the house ♪ ♪ Because I'm a bad girl ♪ Grandpa! Come on, breakfast is ready! [cupboard doors open and close] Whoa, Hurricane Nina. - Good morning! - Good morning! Shouldn't you be resting now? Well, yeah, though I just can't seem to sit still. Oh. Hmm. I bought your favorite bread. But you can only have one piece for now. I'm monitoring your diabetes. [sighs] I know. Now, I just wanna make sure you know that the day you have to go to the hospital, I'll go along with you. No you're not, Grandpa. You're gonna stay here, rest up, and watch your soap opera, and I can handle everything, okay? How come you can't understand that I always want to be with you, right there next to you? It's important. It's your first day of dialysis. I know. Good. What? Pass me the arts section. All right, thank you. I love you. [chuckles] [whistles] [Nina yelps] I can't believe it! Grandpa! HIRING SOLO PIANIST There's a pianist opening at the Symphony Orchestra. You think I should go try out? Honey... no one on earth knows the answer to that better than you. [playing piano notes] I can't play good. My hands are too small. Gi, we've only been practicing this piece for an hour. You know how long it took me to play this when I was your age? One month. Scoot over, let me sit. The secret to playing piano has nothing to do with big or small hands. It's about not giving up. - Let's play together. - Yes. [playing "Für Elise"] SOLO PIANIST Lurdes! Lurdes! You got a minute? Yes, Nina? I decided to try out for the pianist spot with the Symphony Orchestra, but I don't have a piano. And I thought I could use the one here to prepare. - You already do that, Nina. - No, I know I do, but I need to prepare quite a bit more. I thought I might practice overnight after my classes are over. Besides, it would be great publicity for the conservatory if I got in. Do you think you're able to handle all your classes, practicing piano, and your treatment, too? It's my only chance. If you promise me it won't affect the classes, then okay. Thank you. Thank you. [pop music] [car horns honking] [tires screech] Hey! You can't ride a bike here! Hey! SOLO PIANIST [plays notes] [train rumbling] [playing classical piano] [man] Hey, come back here, man! Are you deaf? Hey! Come back! Get off of your bike right now! [piano playing continuous] [uplifting music] [man] Get back here! Get back here! [thud] Hey, what the heck's wrong with you? [man] Hear me out! You're... not allowed... - You're not allowed to ride your bike. - Yes. Sorry, I... got distracted when I saw you. When you saw me? When I saw you playing, I... Because I love Ed Sheeran. It was Chopin. Well, don't know much about piano. But I know there shouldn't be one here. It's in the way, right? No, that's so true. Because this is obviously a cycling track right here. Well, I'm sorry. Go back to your song. You've ruined my mood for the day. Great, well, maybe we'll end up bumping into each other some other time. Bye, you weirdo. [uplifting music] [ambulance siren wailing faintly] Wow, filled up early today, huh? Hey, how are you ladies this morning? Hey, Jess. Baby feeling better? Gabriel, Gabriel. Could it be a heart attack? - This looks like coronary occlusion. - Really? - Any pain? - No. - Positive enzyme? - No. - Then not a heart attack. - Are you certain? Wanna bet dinner on it? No way. I lose the bet every time, Gabriel. Trust me, and I'll stop eating for free. [door opens] [monitors beeping] [man snoring softly] [whispers] Hey. Oh, hi, doctor. And? Did you bring me my flan? Look, you know what happens if they catch you eating this? Thank you! Oh sure, for sure, these lips are sealed. A deal is a deal. [laughs] I'm dying anyway. So what could this damn flan possibly change? Ninety with an appetite of a nine-year-old. Right, Mr. Geraldo? - [laughing] - Here, pound it. Doctor! I'm so sorry to bother you with this, but at night it can get really cold. All right, Maria. Don't you worry. I'll go and get a heater for you, okay? - Thank you, I'm glad. - No problem. This one, she's always so demanding, doctor. Oh yeah, look who's talking, you dirty scrounger! Whoa, you two behave yourselves. [snickering] Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! What'll Dr. Alberto think when he finds out that his son has turned into a flan dealer? I'm not his son here, Mundinha. I passed the exams like all the other residents. All right, sign this here. I'm watching Mr. Geraldo. Come on, don't worry. Look, I don't know how long I can be your accomplice. Bear that in mind. Till I'm not a resident? Okay? I'll consider. [dramatic music] - [snoring] - [door closes] [coughs] [Gabriel laughs] Hey, why don't I give you some nasal strips to stop that horrible snoring. I'm scared I'm gonna find you one day all choked up, asphyxiated. I wasn't sleeping. I was planning some important things. Mm. Right. Why don't you go home and rest? I'm busy talking to my future husband. What husband? - When will I meet the guy? - Calm down, we only just matched. - His name's Tulio. - Ah, Yuri, when are you gonna fall for a real live person? Cut that out, Gabriel. - This is the best way to meet someone. - Not really. Just today, I met a pianist at the station. Really? And where is your pianist? - I lost her. - See? Meanwhile, my future husband is right here. I know his age, address, phone number, how many kids we'll have, his favorite contestant on RuPaul, and I know that our compatibility's over 90 percent. Do you know this girl's name at least? She can play Chopin. Who is Chopin? Nina Soares. Come on, Grandpa. Quickly. Here. [door closes] You again? Do you two know each other? - No. - No. Please, take a seat. Sorry, we thought we had an appointment with Dr. Simone. Is she not here today? Dr. Simone had to go handle a little emergency, but she'll be right back. I'm Gabriel, I'm a resident here, and I'll be assisting you and Nina in the meantime. - Is a resident a doctor? - Grandpa... Of course, absolutely. It just means that I'm still training to hopefully be an expert in general medicine. And a bike expert? Like you are with the piano. Nina, come have a seat over here so I can take a look at your arm. [sighs] Excuse me. The blood flow feels good. The fistula's looking mature. If you two can please wait for me in the dialysis room. First hallway on your left. [Joaquim] Okay. [door opens] Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Resident. - [chuckles] - [door closes] You're 119 pounds. You can step down, honey. I see that you've met Raimunda. You can relax, you're in the best hands in this hospital. Oh, we'll take very good care of her. Sit right here. Now, you can remove your shirt, dear. Now stretch your arm all the way out, honey, so that we can access your veins, okay? [Gabriel] Don't you worry, Nina. Everything'll be fine. How, though? If I'm strapped to this machine day in, day out? The dialysis machine isn't your enemy. It's what's keeping you alive and well. You still have an entire life ahead of you. Then you're a guy who sees the glass half full. Oh absolutely. What about you, Half Empty? At the moment, just empty. Dried out left in the sink. Well, damn. So, we'll have to deal with this one's pessimism, too, huh, Raimundinha? Because life is beautiful. The sun's still shining. I can't sunbathe, though. - You always talk back like that? - And are you always so cheerful? You haven't seen anything yet. Now keep your arm very still, okay? Your session will take four hours. [dramatic music] [Gabriel] Done. You all right? Is there anything else I can do for you today, Nina? No, doctor, but... thank you for asking me. [playing melody] - [floorboard creaks] - [stops playing] Lurdes, Uh... I'm sorry... I... I didn't realize you were here. - Did you have a treatment? - Yes. That's why you were late for your six o'clock class? Yes, but I promise you it won't happen anymore. I'm so sorry, Nina, there's no easy way to say this, but... [sighs] ...we're going to have to terminate your service contract with the school. - What? - You have to get well. You've missed many classes due to the... The... Lupus. You can just say it. You were late, you missed your classes. Also, this thing on your arm. It can be scary for some of the children. And of course your health, too. You need to take some time to take care of yourself. By "some time" you mean forever, Lurdes. I'm sorry, Nina. I'm sure that other doors will open for you. Oh Gabriel, you pamper your patients way too much. What, I should just leave them there freezing? All we're gonna find in here are rats and pigeons. And I hate pigeons. [Yuri] Gabriel. Here, I found the stuff. Let's go. - Help me out. It's heavy. - It's got wheels, Yuri. [dramatic music] [monitors beeping] Hi. - Hi. - So is Half Empty done with her session? She's on the terrace. Gabriel... she isn't feeling so well today. [dramatic music] [footsteps] You found my secret spot? The best place to see the sunset around here. [Nina] Yeah. Since I can't see the sun at midday, the sunset's my consolation. So you're not afraid of heights, huh? No. I mean, sure. But what comes after the fear is worth it. At least that's what I tell myself when I'm mountain climbing. Oh, come on. Are you saying you're a doctor, a cyclist, and a climber? I used to tell myself the same thing, you know? Before I'd perform. That's how I try to face my fears. Yeah. But one day, I was on stage facing my fear, and lupus faced me right back. It took me years to get back on stage. Well, I'm glad you did. When I saw you at the station, I felt... What? That you were really born to do that. Well, thank you, but it's not exactly the venue I wanted to be playing now. Have you been to a live orchestra concert before? So sorry to disappoint you. I'm a poor and uncultured resident. I know nothing about music. Yeah, but you don't have to. Music is... Music is magic. Like it transforms you. Someone plays it, you listen to it, and it changes you. Okay. You convinced me. I want to see you playing at the Symphony Orchestra. First, I need to pass the tryouts. I'm sure you can pass. For a moment, I actually believed it was possible, you know? I really believed it. - You don't anymore? - And then I faced my reality. I've got no kidney, no career, and... I'm not allowed to study at the conservatory. Follow me. [acoustic music] [bangs keys] [laughs] Can't believe it. [plays notes] A little out of tune? [plays classical piece] [sighs] It's perfect. Wow. Now you can start practicing for the audition. Well... not really, no. All right, I know you're the Half Empty girl, - but you're giving up that easy? - No, it's not that. Today... was the very last day to register. - And I never did. - Nina, the day's not over. You can still put your name down. Come on, let's hurry. No, it's impossible. The entire city is gridlocked right now. We would never make it there. We can still try. [upbeat acoustic music] Gabriel! CLOSED [panting] Uh, hi there. We're here to sign up for the audition. I'm sorry, but we've just closed. [Nina] Ma'am, please! It's that... that... that my grandfather... Recently, he passed away. He's in a better place now. And his only dream was to see me pass this exam. Just that. Well, you can ask him. He's a doctor. Are you a doctor? Her grandfather had a sudden involuntary reflex arc caused by spasmodic contractions of muscles in the patient's thoracic cavity. It was so powerful and sudden that... all the doctors in the hospital were stunned. It was just... awful. It was so terrible. So terrible, ma'am. Do you have your ID? Here. Fill out this form. I can't believe you had the guts to kill off your grandfather. What about you? All of a sudden, you invented some disorder. Well, actually, I was just medically describing a little hiccup. [both laugh] - [Nina] There are two phases. - [Joaquim] Hmm. The first one is open. I can choose any composition I want and play it for the jurors. If I pass that, - I go on to finals. - [chuckles] And then it's all or nothing. Mm. Oh, my goodness. It's much too sweet. Does this mean you're in love, Nina? Oh yes, I am. Frédéric Chopin's his name. You heard of him? Hang on. First it was Mozart. And now it's Frédéric Chopin? [laughs] I'm serious, Grandpa. I'm really not in love. I've bigger concerns than silly romance right now. I'm not going! I don't care, I can't go! Oh, hey, what's going on, man? Oh, Gabriel, it's Tulio. - He wants to see me. - Great. Then why are you still here talking to me? Go meet your guy. No, no, I'm not ready to meet for real. I'll stay here. Tell me you're still not using that old bait pic on your profile. From back when I was much thinner? Of course not, Gabriel. Maybe. Sit. Yuri. You're so much more than an old photo and a dating app bio. He's gonna love you, like everybody does. Okay. Do I look good? - [cell phone chimes] - So hot, dude. NINA: THANK YOU FOR THE PIANO, CHOPIN! What is it, Gabriel? What are you giggling at? Who are you flirting with? - Is it the pianist from the station? - Yep You're so lucky, Gabriel. Yeah, but she's my patient at the hospital. No. - But then you can't. - Think I don't know it? But all good, she's just thanking me for the piano. - Uh-huh. - [cell phone chimes] And inviting me over for Brazilian baked rice. Gabriel, Gabriel, you gotta remember the Socratic oath. - "Hippocratic oath," dude. - Hippocrates, Socrates, it's all Italian. If you remember the name, you know the rules. Gabriel, I'm going on my date, but you've really gotta behave. - I'll be watching you. - [door opens] Thank you. [door closes] [grunts] Didn't you say you thought it was corny to post pictures of your meals? Grandpa, hold the plate straighter. - This good? - To the left a little. - How about now? - Perfect. - [camera shutters click] - Done. [both laugh] [cell phone chimes and vibrates] NINA: SHOULD I BRING IT FOR OUR LUNCH AT THE HOSPITAL TOMORROW? - [cell phone chimes] - Can we eat it now? GABRIEL: SORRY, I ALREADY HAVE LUNCH PLANS Yes. Are you busy? No. Oh good, because your dad's looking for you. Then I'm busy. No, no, Gabriel, don't you get me into trouble. Come on, go see Daddy. Go see Daddy. Go. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE [Alberto] Come in. - Did you want to see me? - Yes. [door closes] Sit. I saw the lupus patient's tests. Clearance less than 15. She's already on the transplant waitlist. You've been monitoring this patient, right? How do you anticipate the patient will progress? Her name is Nina. [sighs] Your way of dealing with patients is going to get you in trouble one day, Gabriel. Is it such a problem to ask you to call a patient by her name, Dad? It's a problem to arrange giving a piano to a patient, Gabriel. - Dad, I know what I'm doing. - "I know what I'm doing." It's the phrase that oftentimes precedes a problem. We done? [dramatic music] [sighs] [sighs] [piano being played] I'm sorry. I didn't wanna disturb you. No, it's all right. I'm not getting this part right anyway. - To me, it's perfect. - It's not. Sit here. Let me show you. Trying to play this part here: [plays melody] [inhales sharply and sighs] It's like my fingers don't work. Just overnight, the song I've been playing all my life, not able to play anymore. Can't you play it how you want? I mean, I don't know, different interpretations of the same song. Not if I want to be a soloist in the best orchestra in Latin America. There's only one way you can play it exactly how the notes read on the score. Maestro, can I show off my musical gifts? A la vontê, monsieur. [plays "Chopsticks"] [laughs] Oh, "Chopsticks." Crushed it. A classic one. - Want to hear the original? - Original? [plays "Chopsticks"] You've robbed me of the only song I thought I knew how to play. - I'll stick with the bike. Much easier. - Yeah, for you, it is. If I ever sat on a bike, I know I'd just fall over. You've never ridden a bike? I'll teach you. I think I'm too old to learn how to ride a bicycle now. No, you're too old not to know how to ride a bike. Okay, let's commit to this then. I'll learn how to ride a bicycle, if you learn how to play another song on the piano. Deal? Deal. Now look forward. - Don't let go. - No, no, I won't. To the left, to the left. Okay, let go. - But you just told me not to... - Let go, Gabriel. - I thought I told you not to let go! - I'm sorry. Come on, it wasn't that bad. [playing off-key notes] [Nina] It's right here. Here. It's not fair. The bike has two pedals on it. - Pianos only have one more pedal. - Yeah, and a thousand keys. All right enough, go again. [man singing in Portuguese] GABRIEL: DID YOU GIVE UP ON THE BIKE? GABRIEL: I'M ALREADY A PIANIST NINA: AH, YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL! Gabriel! It's working! [piano being played] [Gabriel] Thanks for the effort, but I think I'll try the harmonica. Come on, Little Glass Full, you won't give up so easily. Sit down here. Okay, I'll try teaching you something a bit easier. - Uh-huh. - Like this. [plays soft melody] - Okay. - That's good. ♪ You will forever live in me ♪ ♪ Tell me our story isn't over ♪ ♪ That beyond the universe ♪ ♪ There's time for me to love you ♪ ♪ And I'll see you there ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah, ah ♪ ♪ And I'll see you there ♪ ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ Why did you stop, Chopin? Your first duet wasn't so hard, right? - Nina, that song is beautiful. - Stop it, I hadn't even finished it yet. It's that... It's just that sometimes, I think my time here is short. And I like to think there's something beyond here, you know? Beyond the universe? That's too far. You never said you could actually sing. - I don't sing, though. - But you should. - Let's celebrate your first concert. - Yeah. A movie? I was thinking of doing something a little bit more... exciting. Come on! [techno music playing] - A bit noisy here, huh? - It's not noise, though. It's music. Would you like to drink something? Soft drink, or a beer, a caipirinha? No, thank you. We better not, due to your fluid intake. Hey, wait, let me get this straight. Are you here as a doctor or as a friend? - A friend. - All right. - No, I'm good, but thank you. - And for you? - Nah, thanks, man. - Okay. - You can drink. - I know I can. But I won't. But you'll dance, right? - [laughing] No, definitely not. - Hey, just for one song. Just for one. Don't overthink. [man singing in Portuguese] [monitors beeping] - [Raimunda] All done, Amanda. - [Amanda] Thank you, Mundinha. [Raimunda] Nina? I'll be with you in a minute, sweetie. Thank you, Munda. Oh, wow. Are we really allowed to drink that much water? No, it's emptied out. [both laugh] This is the lucky cup my daughter gave me to help me get my transplant. That's so sweet. Mm-hmm. I guess I need to drink about 20 gallons of luck. Listen, I got one before. You're gonna get one, too. So, is this your second time getting one? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Weren't you scared, though? Was I scared? Scary is not being able to see my daughter. Not being able to hug my girl. Or not being able to watch my daughter get older. That stuff scares me much more. If this keeps me alive and well, it's worth every minute in here. My daughter's inspired me to see the world differently, you know? Better. [tender music] Hmm. Yeah. Apparently your pessimism's coming to an end soon, huh? [both laugh] [Raimunda] Let's go, Nina. I'll help you up. Okay, now let's go. [Nina] Playing the piano is about more than just pressing keys. Of course, that's fundamental, but you have to know how to read the scores... interpret them... write notes. [playing fast-paced piano music] [dramatic music] [screams] The pain caused by the lupus feels like I'm trying to speak while someone's covering my mouth. "BEYOND THE UNIVERSE" But nothing can silence me again. [uplifting music] Hi, Mr. Joaquim. - [Joaquim] Oh. - [chuckles] Dr. Resident. Just a minute, Gabriel. You! You leave Gabriel alone! Ah. We're just having a chitchat. Want to come in? - No, I'm okay. Thank you. - Well, all right. Yes, good girl. - Did Mr. Joaquim lecture you? - What are you talking about? He loves me. [cell phone rings and vibrates] [turns ringer off] [pills rattle] Candidate number four. [dramatic music] [inaudible] [instructor] Which composition have you chosen to perform? Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata." Okay. Good. You can start playing when the green light switches on, okay? It's important not to exceed your time, though. And if you mess up, just keep going. - Good luck. - Thank you. [playing "Moonlight Sonata"] [stops playing] [inhales sharply and sighs] [resumes playing] So? How was it? You're kidding? [laughs] You did it? [both laugh] [Nina] I did! [Gabriel] Oh! It's great. What about dinner at mine tonight? To celebrate? Do you cook? Of course I cook. [scoffs] I love cooking. I had no idea. Yuri, you gotta cook for me, man. Nina's coming here. - [door closes] - What? Who's this Nina? Nina who? Nina, pianist at the train. From the hospital. My friend Nina. Gabriel, are you seriously still trying to be this girl's friend? Fine, I'll cook, but you've got to clean up this pigsty here. She can't come over and see it like this. You're a pig, Gabriel. But I love you. [sighs] [rock music] Gabriel, why's it have to be rice? What's the deal? Gabriel! Wasn't me. Ta-da! I mean, look at this guy. Great. It's all done. Dude, you're amazing. He's a great doctor, he's a badass chef. - You could maybe lose the snoring someday. - [doorbell buzzes] So, how do I look? Yeah, you look hot. - Really? - I'd marry you. Go. Go on. - Hi. - Can I help you? - Hi, Tulio. - [Tulio] Hi. How are you? Uh, am I here early? No, please, come right in. Hey, how are you? - I'm Gabriel. - I'm Tulio. Your apartment is so cool, guys. - I just thought it'd be bigger. - Thank you. I guess. You want some wine? I can't. I'm allergic. To grapes? Water? - Water's good. - Ah, good. I can help you. Water. - [doorbell buzzes] - No, I'll get it, hang on. Thank you. Oh. So cute. You're trying to help out. - Oh, hey. - Hi. I'm your new neighbor. I was wondering if I could borrow some sugar. Nah, I'm sweet enough, thanks. But we have some rice instead. Yes. [laughs] Wait. Two kisses for sugar? Because I wanted to. Hey! So you must be the famous Nina? - You must be Yuri? - Yes! Live and in person. [both laugh] - Pleasure! - And I'm Tulio. - A pleasure. Tulio. - Tulio. Hi, there. Uh, I'm Nina. Uh... - You live with these guys? - [laughs] No. No, there's no space here. - Wine? - I'm allergic. I know. Sorry about all the mess, Nina. It's just we're never home. You know how it is. It's just fine, guys. Let me get your purse. [Nina] Thank you. Yeah, so then I felt pretty stupid because I didn't know Chopin. [all laugh] Tell me, Nina, do you play piano all the time? Oh, I'm sorry. It's this exercise that I always do. It's like I don't even notice. And so that's why your arm's like that? No, it's an AV fistula. Because I have to do dialysis. Whoa, dialysis? - For how long? - It's Tulio, right? My whole life. Or until I get a kidney transplant. It could be much worse. Have you ever had a bikini wax? Ah! I have, every single week. [all laugh] Really hurts. So you probably can't do a lot. - [thumps table] - Actually, she can do everything, Tulio. Hemodialysis isn't a death sentence. I just have to plan things more than your average person. That's all it is. Seems to me like something's missing. - Some dessert flan. - Some dessert flan. After dessert, you'll go back to his place, he's gotta go. No way. No way, Gabriel. I've known the guy for two weeks. No, for God's sake. You stay strong. Listen, hey, you need help over there? - No, thank you. - It's just a flan. Just this once, Yuri. I beg you. Gabriel, you're kicking me out of my own house. Yeah, but just do it for me, okay? I'll owe you. Come on. Fine. Dude, I promise I'll clean up the house, okay? [both] It's dessert flan! - Look at what we got here. - The flan that Gabriel made for you guys. Oh, I do love flan. - Pour him more wine, Yuri. - I'm allergic, remember? Let's eat this dessert and then call it a night. - So soon? It's so good. - Yes. But Tina didn't even drink. Right, Tina? We're gonna need a knife here. Bye, Gabriel. Bye, Nina. Nice to meet you. - Nina, see you. - [Nina] Good night. Bye. [door closes] God, where does Yuri find these guys? Oh, be nice. He cooked us an amazing meal. How do you know it was him? - I just guessed and you just confirmed it. - So clever. [laughs] The view is beautiful here. It's too bad we can't see the stars. I know a place where you can see the stars regardless of the clouds. Where are you gonna take me now, Gabriel? [Gabriel] Watch out for your head. Step up here. - That's it, right. - Where the heck am I going? Do you trust me? I do. - Okay. - Can I open my eyes yet? No! Half empty and stubborn - I'm opening. - Hey, no, no. - How about now? - Open. [Nina] Wow! You have your own shooting star here. Wanna make a wish? Yes. [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] [string music] [thunder rumbling] [electricity crackling] [sighs] [sighs] Wow! That was... freaking awesome. Oh my God. What's up? That was so cheesy. Cheesy? Oh, I'm cheesy now, am I? [laughs] Silly. - [switch flips] - [gasps] Ah! It's the janitor! [playful music] [laughing] [laughs softly] - Ketchup? - Try it. Oh, Gabriel. Who knew? [giggling] You're full of surprises. My father's recipe. When he was just my dad, and not... the director of the hospital. Can I ask you something? Are you a doctor because of your father? Because of my mother. She's pretty. When I was 13 years old, she found a big lump on her breast. It had already metastasized. It was a long process and it didn't end happily. We did everything to cure her, but... The treatment ended up depriving her of many things that could've helped her. Like taking a walk. A meal outside her diet. A real conversation. Simple things that could've made her treatment just a little bit easier. It's what I try to do for all my patients. Not just cure them, but... make their days a little bit easier. You two look the same. [chuckles] Yes. She really loved the Universe Point mountain. - You went there together? - Yeah, all the time. On her next birthday... I'm going up there. And how about you? You coming with me? You'll love it. If I ever get a new kidney, I'll think about joining you. Tastes like egg. - That's on you. - You didn't even eat it. [laughs] - It's okay. It's okay, I'll finish. - No. [knock on door] Excuse me. Hi, Nina. Dr. Raimunda said you wanted to see me. Yes. Come in. Please sit down. [dramatic music] It's kind of shocking hearing that a part of me simply... doesn't work anymore. We knew that your kidneys could fail, Nina. But we continue your treatment. The dialysis is working. For how long? Until it's your turn to get a transplant. Yeah, but I'm afraid my time will never come. UNIVERSE POINT ORGAN DONATION SYSTEM POSITION ON ACTIVE WAITLIST: 14,890 [sighs] Rai. Are you busy? - Tell me. - I... I think I need your help. So does your dad know that you wanna give her your kidney? You know I don't need his permission. And Nina? Does she know? I really don't know why I still help you. Thank you so much. [sniffling] [sobbing] - Yuri! - [door opens and closes] - Are you okay, man? - [Yuri] No! What happened? I really don't want to talk about it. Just leave me alone, please. I'm worried, dude. Don't leave me hanging. [sobbing] It's Tulio. He's terrible. He's toxic. He's with someone else. He what? [Yuri sobbing continuous] Yes! He's married! He has a husband, he has a house, he even has a Lhasa apso. The guy came home, and I had to run away. I'm his mistress. It was so humiliating. [Yuri sobbing] Yuri. You'll find your Mr. Right soon. I won't. And if you don't, I'm here. We'll get married, I promise. [crying and laughing] I don't know if I'm crying or laughing. Thank you. You really aren't my type, but thank you. Okay, now can you take a quick photo of me looking like decadent diva in the bath? - For real? - Tinder. Have you heard about grieving the breakup? It's easy for you. You have your beautiful pianist from the station. - I have nothing. I only have Tinder. - Fine, let's capitalize on this suffering. - That's good. - [duck squeaks] Is this too much, though? Now one more photo? Wait. Is it good? Okay. Show me. DAD: COME HERE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. IT'S IMPORTANT. Gabriel, this is not good. Gabriel, these look horrible. Would you like some water, or juice? - I'm fine, thanks. - I'll get your dad, okay? [plays note] [playing slow melody] [Alberto] Apparently, you found yourself a teacher. - Does your wife play? - No. Not often enough to justify this. This thing's just decorative and pricey. Yeah, that's such a waste. Whiskey? No. [Alberto] It's time for you to mature your palate, Gabriel. Whiskey's what separates the men from the boys. If you say so. I wanted you to come and talk with me about your patient. Nina. How is she doing? - Good. - Is she really? So that's why you did the compatibility test? You have no right... The right to know about the tests being taken in my hospital or to take care of my son? [sighs] I think you're starting to cross some boundaries, Gabriel. - Not if the transplant works. - It won't. Not with your kidney. Your test was negative. You two are incompatible. I really wish that you cared this much about Mom when she was alone and miserable in here, you know? So you're going to keep attacking me for that. I'm not attacking you. You're hearing your own conscience. I just remind you of it. I loved her very much, Gabriel. You loved her? Well, too bad she died, huh, Dad? And where were you? Hmm? In surgery? Or at a fancy conference? Or buying some flashy expensive thing she wouldn't use ever? You were never with her. Gabriel, you work within an institution, and every institution has its rules. You made up this treatment with absurd rules and I couldn't see my own mother. You only do what you want, Gabriel. If that's all you wanted to say, I think we're done here. Listen, if this thing goes on, I'll have to choice but to report you to the residency committee. They'll open an investigation and you'll lose your post at the hospital. And I won't be able to help you then, Gabriel. Gabriel. - Gabriel. - Let me go. [Nina] I've practiced so much for tomorrow's tryout that I can't even pick up a piece of pizza. I took the compatibility test. You'd never ask me to, so... I just did. It didn't match, huh? [dramatic music] But thank you. It means the world to me. You know that? You know I'd do it for you. I know. The right way, though. I still have the right to decide if I want someone's kidney inside me. From someone alive. Someone I love. You do.

Until eight in the evening? I'm in the ER? Who the hell did that? Dude, I'm in another sector. Yeah. What did you think rotation means? It's resident rotation. No, definitely my dad. [Yuri] You're being too paranoid, Gabriel. Raimunda, what should we do? [knock on door] EMERGENCY ROOM [dramatic music] We have at least 20 new files. If you'd arrived on time, it wouldn't be so crowded. I'm sorry, doctor. Instead of wasting more time apologizing, just start here. Frederico Gonçalves. Honey. Are you already dressed up? Well? How do I look? As your grandma used to say, "Sweetheart, you're stunning!" Oh Grandpa, thank you. But you're not going like that, right? It's only four in the afternoon, honey. You still have four more hours until your presentation. Grandpa, I'm like freaking out. Hey, come on, help me, please. - Go get dressed. Hurry, hurry. - Okay, I will. I will... [dramatic music] Amanda Vieira. NINA: ARE YOU COMING? NINA: TURNING OFF MY PHONE, IT'S STARTING... Candidate Nina Soares. - Good evening, Nina. - Good evening. [suspenseful music] We would like you to play the first movement from "Concerto No. 2" by Rachmaninoff. [playing "Concerto No. 2"] - [car horn honks] - [tires screech] [breathing heavily] [man] Nina. Nina. Call an ambulance. Nina. Nina! I'm with her! No, no, no! [panting] - [engine starts] - [ambulance sirens blare] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [monitors beeping] [Simone] Hi there, darling. Good evening. - My back really hurts. - Don't move. [shushing] How long was I here? It's the third day you're here, Nina. You were first intubated, then sedated. You had an alveolar hemorrhage. Your lupus is really active right now, Nina. We need to adjust your medication to better control it and get you in shape for a transplant. How long will I stay here? You need to be in observation. Then you'll head over to the ward. And, if everything goes well, we'll think about your discharge. [knock on door] I think someone's very eager to pay you a visit. Hi, Dr. Simone, I... I'm sorry, I... - I came to... - [Simone] Mm-hmm. I know. How are you? Thirsty. Nina, I'm sorry, I... I couldn't get there in time for you. Work was so chaotic. It seems our good luck is starting to turn. [thunder rumbles] But how so? Nina? You played on the symphony's stage. Gabriel. I don't feel hopeful anymore. [dramatic music] [thunder crashes] [sighs] [monitors beeping] Hey. I didn't know you would be here. You never leave this place, not even on your day off, huh, kiddo. You're just like your old man. - Hey. Don't say that stuff, Mundinha. - [chuckles] And you? Two days ago, you were in intensive care, and now here you are back on your feet. Hurricane Nina. I found an email from my mom... with photos of our spot. It's so beautiful. I want to take you there. You and me. Gabriel, Mr. Geraldo wants to talk with you. Can you head over there? Do you mind, Nina? No, it's fine. All good. Be right back. [indistinct chatter] [cell phone chimes and vibrates] DR. GABRIEL MORAES INVESTIGATION "You have been convoked to the hospital's upcoming residency committee meeting, due to the investigation into the ethics of your conduct and the relationship between doctor and patient, at which time we'll determine whether to continue your residency." Nina. - Everything okay? - Yes. Mr. Geraldo was just asking about his precious flan. That old guy. So, you like it? It's so beautiful. And we'll have three days of adventures. First of all, we'll go on a five-hour hike to the waterfall. It's the most beautiful waterfall. I think you're really gonna love it. I can't wait to show you. [continues indistinct] [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] [Gabriel] Nina! [claps] Nina! Nina! [whistles] [dogs barking] [thunder rumbles] [door closes] Nina? Are you okay? You didn't answer my texts. I was worried about you. Sorry, I was just sleeping. And why'd you leave the hospital without saying bye? [sighs] I just needed to leave, you understand? To think. You could have told me. I'd have brought you to your house. It's not right, Gabriel. Why not? - All of it. - Nina, about the symphony... we'll explain the situation to the jurors. I'm a doctor. I'll ask them to reconsider. What for? To just pass out during my very first performance again? I finally have to accept... that my life's never gonna be normal. That I'll never play in an orchestra. - That I'll never be able to date. - Hang on. What do you mean by that? Nina, you're mixing everything up. No, on the contrary, Gabriel. I'm... trying to un-mix up everything. You're the doctor. And I'm the patient. You have a life ahead of you, and I'm gonna die. Nina. Why are you talking like this? This is not the Nina I know. You don't know me at all. You have no idea what's going on inside my head. Nina, come on. You can't just give up like this. That's easy to say when you have no clue what it's like to be going through this. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, that's true, but I'm here every single day by your side. Nina. 'Til when, Gabriel? 'Til you end up losing your residency? [thunder crashes] You hid this from me. This has nothing to do with you. This has everything to do with me. Do you realize they could expel you all because of me? Nina, it's just a residency. I can always start over. You don't have to worry about that. It's up to me. Yeah, well, you don't get to choose everything. And what does that mean? I think I'm just done. I really can't afford to waste all my energy on something that isn't my treatment. [sniffles] Understand? Why'd you say "Waste"? I didn't know... you saw me like that. [thunder crashes] That's it. I just got carried away. I realize now that I don't love you, Gabriel. It's over. The best you can do now is tell the hospital that you're sorry. Then get on with life. I've always been alone. And I'll stay that way. You didn't have to go it alone.

What's been going on? What's wrong? - I broke up with Gabriel. - My oh my... when I was your age, I couldn't sit still either. [chuckles] I really had some fun. But I still love him. Yeesh... Your story is more twisted than this straw here. [Raimunda] Honey, I'll get you out. Let's go. Thank you, Munda. Hmm. Let's go. The committee's meeting today to decide if he stays here or not. They don't want a doctor going out with a patient, so I decided to end it. Ah. Look... that was the noblest decision I've ever heard of in my life. - And also the stupidest! - Amanda. Oh, Munda, this girl's gone through hell for so many years. Now that she has something good with a nice guy, she just quits because she's afraid. - He's better off without me. - Oh, and what makes you say that? - Because I'm gonna die, Amanda. - Right now? What do you mean? - Are you dying now? - No. Will you die today? Or is it next week? Ah, sounds like she got you. Nina, you could die right now or die in 30 years. You know what? This thing here is for those who aren't afraid of living. Nina, you do know that the meeting's starting now? - Right now? - Yeah, right now. I'm all done here. Really? [upbeat music] All right, we are convened here today to deliberate about the personal relationship between Dr. Gabriel and the patient... Nina? What are you doing here? Young lady, this is a private board meeting. So I'm asking you to leave now. Not before hearing what I have to tell you. [sighs] My gosh, I've been coming to this hospital since I was 13. I know this place better than many of you. And I need to tell you about Gabriel. He's truly the best doctor here. And this isn't about us being together. It's about the patients that he treated, listened to, helped out, embraced. If you expel him, all the patients here will suffer from that loss. Dr. Gabriel's behavior with me has always been respectful and professional. So... if you need someone to blame... I'm to blame. And besides, I'm the one who went after him, - who grabbed and kissed him first... - Miss Nina, uh, that's enough for now. I think we've heard your message, okay? Thank you all for your time. [snores] The death of Yuri Saad, 23 years old. Cause of death: obstructive sleep apnea. So? So? - Won't get rid of me so easy. - [Yuri exclaims] You're such a rebel, dude. You gotta behave. - Yuri, I need to trade shifts with you. - Uh-huh. Cover for me this time and I'll owe you double. I like this proposal, getting paid double. Thank you. Mundinha, can you meet me at the chapel tomorrow? I have an idea, and I'll need your help. [phone beeps off] [cell phone vibrates and chimes] Hi, Nina. We're gonna have a little party today for Amanda. Come join, okay? I, uh, don't really want to. - Oh. - Uh... But please tell her congratulations. Is it really her birthday? Yeah, it's her birthday. Come over, join us, hon. It could cheer you up a bit! Come! I'm staying here, all right? Nina! Get up right now and go wash your face off. Come on, Nina! - Hi, Amanda. - Go do it right now. Or forget about me on the next dialysis. At seven this evening, we'll party. [uplifting music] Wow, your hair has a really lovely texture. - Mm-hmm. - You should be proud of that. - You think? - Oh, yeah. Here. Take this to the chapel. Josefa has the light bulbs with her. Try to untangle them because they're a little tangled up. Okay, good. Yuri? - What's all this going on here? - Hi. Well... What? Uh... - Gabriel's been organizing an event... - Gabriel? ...at the chapel. - Which event? - And you can, - if you want, join them in the chapel... - No, he can't leave his shift like that. No, no, no, the girls are covering for him. Sir, um... you, uh... Doc... - ...tor Alberto. - Mm. Gabriel says he's willing to work all the weekend shifts this month. - And? - Just give him a chance. [scoffs] Just once. You're finally here! [sighs] Hmm. Wear this. - What is this, Munda? - Wear this, come on. I will. [tender music] [no audio] It's such an honor to have you in our concert hall, Miss Nina. [dramatic music] What is this? Performance by the most talented pianist in the world. Come with me. [applause] [plays classical piano] She's my granddaughter. [playing continuous] [song ends] [whistling and applause] [uplifting music] Hi, come this way. Nina. That was beautiful. Thank you. I've discussed your case with the orchestra's jury, and due to the circumstances, we would all really like to evaluate you once again. If you want to, of course. Yes, of course I want to. [laughs] Thank you. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. Gabriel... I'm sorry. I was afraid of messing up your whole career. But Amanda came and scolded me, and then I crashed the meeting and said all that stuff because I really didn't want you them to expel you. [Nina laughs] You weren't expelled, were you? [uplifting music] [applause] [Nina] Will you record a video for me while you're there? Promise. But very soon you'll be up that mountain too. With me there by your side. Will you promise to be careful until I get back? I promise I won't die before you're back. So, I'll give you this. To make sure that you'll get to grow wrinkly and old. [giggles] It was a gift from my mom. - No, Gabriel, I can't accept it. - You can and you will. Turn around. It'll look after you until I come back. I love you, Gabriel. I love you, Nina. [romantic music] [majestic music] [hawk screeches] [sighs] [playing classical piano] [wind gusts] [playing continuous] [sighs] [dramatic music] [playing continuous] [hammer thuds, piano note reverberates] [dramatic music] [ambulance siren wailing] [Alberto] Son! My boy... I'm here to take care of you. Dad. Dad. - I'm glad that you're here. - I'm here to take care of you. I'll take care of you. Come on, guys, please. Alberto, Gabriel was brought by helicopter. He's suffered a severe head injury. We did a CT scan and detected a subdural hematoma, Alberto. Subdural hematoma. We'll have to open him up. [sighs] [somber music] Munda, where is he? What happened to him? I don't know, Nina. He went straight into the operating room a little while ago and...

As I promised you, here's this amazing view. You were on my mind today. Soon we'll be up here together. - Nina, honey. - Well... - take care until I'm back. - The hospital just called. They need us to head over there. Do you remember that day the Dr. Resident came here to visit? I was talking to him, and then you shouted, "Grandpa!" "Leave him alone!" I wasn't lecturing him. I was just telling him not to ever hurt you. Living your life now, that's the best possible way you can commemorate him. Because... the only thing that boy wanted was to see you do this. Living. [somber music] [inhales sharply] [Simone] Nina, I have a document here. They're the results of an organ compatibility test. For your kidney transplant. It is positive, Nina. From the waitlist? No. It's actually a living donor. If you decide to go forward with this, there are certain legal proceedings, but... it's possible, honey. [laughs] [sniffles] Can you tell me the name of the donor? I don't know if it's good, but Gabriel just loved rice cooked in a skillet and dessert flan. Give it a taste. - Mm. - It's so good. - You like cooking? - Mm-hmm. Oh no, I'm terrible. [laughs] Oh, like your son. [Nina laughs] But this one time, he made me a dish of eggs with ketchup. Oh no, I can't believe he made you eat that. I loved it. I cooked that for him when he was young. I didn't know what to feed him, and he was so hungry. We invented that strange recipe together. He's never forgotten it. [dramatic music] Let's do the dishes. Yeah, let's go. [sighs] Why are you doing this? So you don't have to do them later. I don't mean the dishes. Uh... Why'd you want to be my donor? [sighs] Nina... I've thought a lot about this one old professor I had back in college. He used to say that medicine is sometimes about finding a cure, oftentimes it's about relief, and it's always about comfort. That's it. I can help you, right? And that's all that matters now. Thank you. And Gabriel deeply believed this. And I... I can see aspects of my son in you. Mind if I hug you? [sighs] [tender music] And now, I have a highly serious question to ask you. Could I grab another piece of flan? There's someone at hospital who loves it a lot. Oh yeah, of course, you can take it all. I'll cut you a piece. [Nina] I got a kidney on my birthday. September 30th. And I finally understood what it means to be compatible. ONE YEAR LATER I had thought compatibility was about equality, but it's really about being different. My beloved Fabrício and Yuri. Do you promise to love each other, to comfort each other, honor and keep each other, in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? - Yes. - Yes. Then, I now pronounce you married partners. - You may now kiss. - Finally, you guys! [applause] Whoo! [Nina] Gabriel was different from me. He was able to see before everyone else, even me, what I was truly capable of. [orchestra playing classical music] He showed me that life is a glass half full. I certainly found the person I'm most compatible with. - [song ends] - [applause] Good evening. Thank you for your presence. This performance season has been so magical. And I'd also like to pay a particular tribute to a person very special to me. He helped me to be here with you.
