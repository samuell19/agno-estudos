Oh yeah, and son of Mr. Truman Boudreau. Boy, I hit the big time at last. Some big time. Squawling kid, an alcoholic skirt chaser for a husband. I waited years in that ranch hand's cottage. Your farmhouse. We didn't have any money. But your grandfather helped me out. See? Yeah, he helped me out, alright. And there's Malcolm acting the whole time like he don't know what's going on and I am not gonna let you disappoint me anymore. - No, Mom, listen. I'm not Dad, I'm not. - Billy and I are moving to Dallas at the end of June. That farmhouse, by the way, isn't worth the rent you owe me for it. I had it assessed. - The rent I owe you? - You can go over the figures with my accountant if you want. Or if you want to try to sue, maybe you can find a way to pay me back, but my lawyer doesn't think that tenancy clause is exactly iron clad. - Well, I guess the place is yours, then. - Just business, honey. (gunshots blasting) (siren blaring) - [Richter] Shit, Keith. - [Cop] You, hands on your head, both hands. - [Richter] Officer, there's a-- - Shut up! Now, shut off the ignition and take out the key. Do it slowly. Now, throw it out. Nice and slow, put both hands on the wheel. (gunshot blasting) Mother fucker! Don't you fuckin' move. (gunshot blasting) - Yeah! (chuckling) Well, that's okay. - [Cherry] I wanna do it again. - That's okay. Everybody misses the first time. Okay, get your hand back up, now. Hand off, finger off the trigger, finger off the trigger. - [Cherry] Wait, wait, wait. - [Keith] Now, let's cock it all the way. Get your finger away from, that's it, finger on the trigger, go. (gunshot blasting) (screaming) Yeah, that's good. That's a good one. - [Cop] Put the gun down! - [Keith] Hey, this is private property. You put your gun down. - [Cop] Now, or the next one's in your ass. - Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. - It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. - Keith got busted. - [Richter] Yeah, yeah. - Never should have talked back to those cops. Ronnie's gonna freak. - Cherry, look, I thought that Keith did it. - Did what? Shot up some flower pots. - No, but I thought that it was Keith. Ronnie's blackmail. I mean, I drive up, I see Keith's car and I thought oh, you know, God. - Lucky for me you're stupid, otherwise I'd be dead. - [Keith] Aw, man. Aw, shit. (melancholy music) - [Richter] Cherry. Cherry, listen, I-- (crashing) - [Cherry] Fuck. - Hey, hey. Listen to me, listen to me. Listen to me. I brought you here without thinking, but Keith was out of town 'til Tuesday, so I thought that I had enough time to get to know you and then get you outta here but I just, I just wanted to get to know you, more than anything and that made me stupid. - Real stupid. - I'm sorry, I just... If you knew Keith then... It's not him, though. Who the hell is it? - Talk to Ronnie. (mumbling) - It's about time. Where are my guns? Where are my guns, this is bullshit. - [Cop] Watch your mouth. - Keith, sign the paper, it's late. - What a fucking set up. Okay pal, fine. Fine, I can play your game. I'm gonna sue your pig ass off. - Better watch who you're callin' pig, fat boy. - What are you gonna do about it, huh? - Keith. - Fuck you. Fuck you! - Cut it out, cut it out. - Hey, and you, you think I don't know what's going on here with you? If you want my money, you're gonna have to do more than fuck my sister to get it, you understand me? - Listen here, my friend. You just remember who it is you're-- - I know who it is I am fucking talking to. And if you don't find a way to get my guns, I am going to kick your ass. Understand? - [Richter] Hey Chipper. How's that old backhand? - They're out to get me, man. And I don't know how to stop it. Hey, I done some crazy shit, right? - [Richter] Yeah. - But I ain't crazy. - I know you're not. - Well, Chip and Vicky, they think different. They think they can prove it, too. Hell, all it takes is the right judge and a piece of paper. - Come on, Keith. She's your sister. - You know, that's what I like about you. You remember us the way we used to be. As if it mattered. (bells clanging) (whistle blaring) - [Man On Phone] Yeah, Mr. Shaw wants to see you at the country club, right now. - Young Boudreau. Can I mix you a cocktail? No, wanna keep a clear head? Well, good for you, son, good for you. You know, I bartended for five summers in a row when I was young. You know they say that a man can learn a great deal standing behind a bar. You know what I learned? Keep your jacket clean, smile for tips and never, never serve a married woman before lunch. (chuckling) Sit down, Richter and have yourself a nut. You workin'? - [Richter] Yeah, over at the Journal. - The Journal? Oh, damn, Preston's getting me out of this. What are you, some kind of a news hound or what? - [Richter] A movie reviews. - Man, I haven't seen a movie in see, well the last movie I saw was Cleopatra. And Liz Taylor and those violet eyes. (laughing) Are you sure I can't mix you something here? Oh, I know, I betcha, I bet you're one of those diet soda drinkers, aren't ya? - Got any Bushmills? - Irish, you bet. Coming right up. You like it with ice with that? - [Richter] Yes, please. That's fine. - Ah, Richter. You and I, we have a problem. We are men, we love our women badly. - Well, that is a problem, I guess, but-- - Yeah, well it's not that mean to, but it's hard to control those urges. Sometimes those urges can lead us astray. Follow me, what I'm... - Sort of. - Well, the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to understand that I know the way you treated my daughter, not to forgive, I can't manage that, but now, now she's finally coming home and by God, that makes me happy. - That's great, really, anything I can... Well, there's probably not, but if there's anything I can... - Of course there is, Richter. That's why your butt's in that stool. Wherever you came from, you go back there. The sooner, the better. Take a trip. Go visit some of your big city friends and send the bills to me, at least until-- - Mr. Shaw, I'm not sure you have the right idea about me and Brenda. - I know exactly the way it was. Now you just send those bills to me. - I don't want your fucking money. - Times are changing, son, and not for the better. We are all going to be tested. You damn sure will be tested. - Yeah well, as long as they grade on a curve. - Richter. Richter! I could have been a good friend to you, once upon a time. - For fuck's sake, Harmon. Can you think of a single reason why? - Well, let's just say your mother and I are old friends. Eh, Richter, you could almost be my son. (uptempo music) - Get this, everybody's favorite millionaire oil man had himself a little terrorist problem Saturday night. - Hello? - Now, we all-- - Cynthia Rawling, please. Cynthia Boudreau, Simpson, Rawling. - Now, we all know Harmon Shaw-- - Her son. - Values nothing above his loving family. - I'll hold, sure. - I suppose that even includes the daughter he stashed in the bin. You remember her, Richter. But no one occupies a more fruitful place in the old racist's heart than son and heir, Bedford. - Bedford. - Why anybody would wanna blow up young Bedford's car is a mystery. - Yeah, will you tell her that Richter called? - Happily, young Bedford was inside the restaurant when the explosion went off. After a routine questioning by police-- - Yeah, thanks a lot. - The badly shaken heir apparent went into seclusion at his daddy's ranch. Sort of a shit-kicker Xanadu. - [Richter] White classic sports car. - Richter. - When did this happen? - Saturday. I pull into this parking lot, there's two fire engines, an ambulance and about 19 squad cars and this stinking pile of burned rubber and metal in the middle of it. - Yeah, where was Bedford during all of this? - Camped out in his old man's stretch, very emotional, very distraught. - Harmon was there? Well, he got there kinda quick, didn't he? - Shaw's giving a press conference tomorrow. Maybe you wanna help me cover! Richter! - Hello? Ronnie? Hello? Vicky? (gasping) - You lookin' to get killed, cowboy? Baby still asleep? Had to run down to the Git-n-Go. She hears a car start, she'll wake up just like that. Man can't go without smokes when he's thinking. - Choked the shit outta me. - I thought you were somebody else. No car out front, I find somebody sneaking around my yard. Had people come in here with loaded guns before. - [Richter] I parked down the block. Thought it'd be better. - Want a beer? - [Richter] No, thanks. - Shit, it's hot out. - [Richter] We got some real bad news here. Check this out. - [Ronnie] Yeah, I seen this. - [Richter] What do you mean, you've seen it? - It was on TV last night. Means they're finally starting to take me serious. I upped the ante to one and a half. - You did what? - I called him up. Told him I was tired of this shit. They wanna fuck around, the price goes up. - Yeah, but they just destroyed the evidence, right? Now it's just Cherry's word against his. - Ain't a fucking code of law, Richter. Ever gets that far, we're fucked anyways. - So, what'd they say? Now, we're gonna blow up the car to show good faith? - They didn't say nothin'. They just listen and hang up. - Oh, well why didn't you say so? That's very promising. This is fuckin' suicide. - This is a fuckin' turkey shoot, my friend. Cherry took a little souvenir, remember? I left it with you for safe keeping. - Yeah, see, I didn't know that you were talking about Bedford Shaw, about Harmon Shaw. White sports car, I thought you were talking about Keith. - Well you thought wrong. - Hey, what are y'all doin'? Kissing in here? Thanks babe. Hello, Richter. It's nice to see you. I walked past your car down the block, I thought, well, that is Richter's car, but I guess he just forgot where we live, didn't he? Guess it didn't surprise me seein' as how I don't actually remember last time you paid us a visit. (mumbling) Every little thing okay 'round here? I just had so much fun playing tennis the other day. - Yeah, yeah, that was great. - Oh. Here's your nasty, goddammit. Did you wake up Clem just to get a pack of cigarettes? Did you? You couldn't fuckin' wait? (chuckling) - She's asleep. Richter babysat while I was out. - Great. Just type role model we need, isn't it? Oh damn, Ronnie! (chuckling) Oh dear. - Shoulda put it in one of them ice cream bags. Got some things to see to. - Ronnie, Ronnie we really oughta talk before-- - [Ronnie] Talk to Vicky. - Vicky. Listen, I gotta get back to work. - Richter honey, I just can't take it. - Don't worry, baby. We'll play tennis again real soon. - That's not what you think it is. It's over now, believe me. - I always believe you, that's the trouble. I think I hear your child. (chuckling) - Well, isn't this appealing? Yep, I always wear ice cream on hot days. Your home, Clem honey. - I really, I gotta go. - It's okay. I'm not gonna keep you. Hell, Richter, I'd go to bed with you right now if I thought I could get away with it. - What? - You better go now. (mumbling) falling apart. I don't think the bases are gonna be very attractive. ♪ You could cry harder now ♪ For you to hear me now - [Richter] Don't stop. - Can't sing if somebody's watching. I was sorta planning on sleeping in a different room every night, but you know what? I like this one. It's a high school girl's room. I never got to be a high school girl. You look like shit. - [Richter] Thank you, I feel like shit. I gotta get some sleep. - [Cherry] Tough weekend, huh? - Oh, I don't know. Murder, blackmail, guns, cops in the backyard. Job's hanging by a thread. Oh yeah, my own mom swindled me out of house. Tough doesn't really do it justice. - [Cherry] Sorry. - [Richter] My life was never that ordinary anyway. I always took pride in that somehow. - [Cherry] Richter Boudreau, you need a buddy. - I need a grizzly bear with a law degree. - And like the buddy system, you take care of me, I'll take care of you. - I'm not qualified, Cherry. (melancholy music) - You wanna fuck? - I'd like to, but all things considered... - Cuddle, then. - That's better. - Cherry! Hey Cherry, come on honey, we gotta go. It's time to go. - [Cherry] Yeah, I'm coming. - [Keith] We can't be late, you know. - You're going to court with Keith? - Now that we know he's not a cold blooded killer. Feel sorry for him. - [Richter] Yeah, well you haven't done 20 years as his friend. - Vicky's trying to get rid of him. Put him away. - Now, you don't know Vicky. She couldn't be bothered, not even for Keith. - You got a thing for her, right? - Well, who, who... What, did Ronnie say that? - Ronnie didn't say anything. Keith did. He knows all about what she's been up to. - Look, Keith Michaels is not allowed in our buddy system, alright? I'm gonna change my name and join the Marines. - Do you, Richter? - Do I what? - Do you still have a thing for her? - [Keith] Cherry! - [Cherry] Ronnie called. He wants his pouch back. - [Richter] Brinkman. - Hang on, look at this mock up. Preston won't run it. Too suggestive, he says. I can't imagine what he was talking about. Check out his bodyguards. Real (mumbling) boys. My favorite's the tall one with the tattoos. He look like he eats live squirrels for breakfast and washes 'em down with gasoline. - [Richter] Tattoos? - Yeah, flaring skulls, the usual Jesus stuff. You're looking very jumpy, Richter. - I'm not, I'm not, I'm fine. - Okay. - [Woman On Speaker] Richter Boudreau, Mr. Liddy would like to see you in his office. - [Preston] Gonna have to let you go, Richter. - Okay. - Missed deadline Friday, I gave you another break. Missed another one yesterday. It's a pattern. I don't know what it is. Whether you wanna be psychologically punished or what? - Okay. - Are you on narcotics? Wash my hands of it. Won't put up with it. I got thugs coming around here asking questions about you and your friends. That's right, that's right. - You what? - I don't know what you been up to, but I can't have that kind of thing 'round here. - Who were they? What did you tell them? - I don't think that's any of your concern. - Oh, you don't? What, are you a fuckin' idiot? What did you fuckin' tell them? - Start walkin' mister. Nobody talks to me that way and especially not a black sheep Boudreau. - Black sheep's son of a black sheep Boudreau, prone to violence. I know, let's crack this chair-- - Joyce! - Stick it inside, huh? - Joyce, you wanna get building security up here? I bent over backwards for you, boy and I don't even like ya. Only reason I hired you was because of your mother. - Oh, Preston. Did you fuck my mom, too? (uptempo rock music) Don't move. - Jesus God. Are we being a little hostile here? Lord, I had to come over. Things between me and Ronnie have gotten real bad. I need to talk to you. - Go ahead. - Could you not point that thing at me? - Oh, God. I'm sorry. - Oh, hey. It's okay. Just, it's alright. It's okay. I know you hate me. Guess what? I hate me, too. - I don't hate you. How could I hate you? You're, you're Vicky. - Why don't you kiss me, then? (moaning) This is bad. And I knew it would happen. (melancholy music) I come by and this boy points a handgun at me and here I am wanting to go to bed with him. I wanna fuck you across the sky. (melancholy music) Come on. My room. Oh, know what I did? Me and little Clem, we checked into one of those motel rooms, you know the type. That stupid strip of paper across the toilet, huh? I was thinking. I mean, maybe tomorrow morning, we could just go somewhere. You be daddy to my little girl. - Well, looky here. (laughing) It's a party. (clicking) Oh, say cheese. - [Vicky] Get out. - Man, this isn't funny. Come on. - Hey, this belong to you? Get this shit out of my house. - Hey, give me the camera, Keith. Hey, Keith. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Keith. Key. - You're not my friend. - I'm your friend, Keith. - You were never my friend. - [Vicky] Put down that gun, Keith. No! - Hey! Maybe we should see how you like it, huh? You like it, don't you? This is what it feels like. You want it? Huh, I know what you like. Yeah, you like this, don't you? - Go do it. Do it. (grunting) (clicking) Ah! (laughing) I thought you were gonna do us all a favor. You fat pig. - That's funny. - You're such a coward. (tense music) - You think so? You think so? Now, look at this. One bullet, just one. (laughing) Now, let's see how good your luck is. (grunting) - [Vicky] Oh! - Huh, wanna try again? - [Vicky] Keith no! Oh! - You like it, you wanna do it again? - No, no, no! Goddamn you! - Do it again, huh? Now you go on over there to your loverboy. Why don't you go on? Move! - Why don't you jerk off somewhere else for a change? - Maybe I will, huh? But I'm gonna get a couple of shots first. Grab his cock. I said grab his cock! Now! - Okay, okay, here. There, alright? (laughing) - That's good. Ah, yes. I like that. (clicking) Perfect. Now all I gotta do is figure out who to send it to. Chipper or Ronnie? How 'bout both, huh? See ya, Boo. Y'all want some privacy? (laughing) - He's one sick fuck. - [Richter] Yeah. What are you... - You stay put, you hear? Vicky's gonna take care of everything. (melancholy music) - [Richter] Cherry, seen Keith? Did he go to Ronnie's? - Howdy, partner. - Listen, he's got something that belongs to me and I just, I need to get it back, that's all. - Like maybe he took some pictures? - I don't want to hurt you but it's all that I can do to concentrate on myself right now. - [Cherry] Fuck you. - Hey. - What's the matter? She never did pictures before? I did. You wanna hear about some private pictures? - No, Cherry, look. I just need to... - We did our thing. Me and Earla. Some rich boy comes on to her after our show. Go out with me, baby. Sure sugar, she says. - I don't have to hear this. - 'Til Earla comes home, and she's all upset, right? Rich boy takes her to some motel. Wants her to suck him off while he's cursing her, calling her nigger and shit. He hurt you, Earla baby. No, he didn't hurt nothing. Paid me $200. It's a rich little fuck got lots of money. So, rich boy comes back two nights later. Wants her to go out again. So, I go fuck him. Fuck him, Earla. I got a camera, let's do a thing, okay? So I go leave the blinds open at the motel. Me in the bushes with my Nikon. So, rich boy's callin' her nigger, cums right away, all over. But he's really pissed. He's yellin' at her like it was Earla's fault. Big nigger dick, that's what you want, baby. Sure, you big nigger dick. And he's got a club, a big fucking club and he's sticking her with it and she's yelling and he's hitting her and hitting her and hitting her and I couldn't move. I couldn't move! (melancholy music) - Hey, hey come on. We'll get out of town, right? We'll go to Houston, we'll drive down to Mexico or something. - No. - Listen to me, we'll just get the fuck outta town, alright? - He killed her. He hurt her and he killed her. We're gonna make him pay! - Fuck is everybody thinking? This is Harmon Shaw's baby boy. Do you understand? Harmon Shaw. - Is he evil? - What? - Is he evil? - Yeah. Uh, I've been trying to call you. - [Ronnie] Here I am. - [Richter] Yeah, listen. Why'd you trash my house? - [Ronnie] I didn't. - [Richter] Well then, who did? - [Ronnie] Vicky! Vicky! Vicky here? - No. - Vicky split. - She did? - [Ronnie] I thought maybe you knew. - [Richter] No, I didn't. - She's been fuckin' around. I thought maybe you knew. - [Richter] No, listen, I don't think-- - I don't think nothing. You got the pouch? I want them pictures, Richter. - Pictures? Uh, the pouch is still at my mom's. I haven't touched it except to hide it, of course. But she came back last night before I had a chance to get it out of there, but that's not the only problem-- - You're dicking around with me, comrade. - No, no. Listen, there's a reporter I know, lady that did the car story? She was covering Shaw's press conference and she noticed one of his bodyguards has this tattoo, this big tattoo, this big fuckin' tattoo right here. I think that I've seen this guy before when I met you and Cherry at that strip joint. If that's him, if it's the same guy, he was right there. He must have seen us. This guy came to my office asking questions and shit. He must have trashed my house. They know who we are. - Maybe they do. I ain't surprised. What do you think I'm doing this for, Richter? - I don't know. - Think about it. Think hard. - What, the money? - Fuck the money. Money on it's own don't mean a fuckin' thing. You oughta know that. I worked at the country club one summer, shagging golf balls on the driving range. Used to ride around on this little fuckin' tractor inside a cage so the rich folks could practice while I retrieved. One day I'm sweating in that cage and this big fucker decides he gonna make a game of me and so he aims at that tractor with me inside and he's hittin' bucket after bucket. Balls are banging off the tractor, banging off the bars. He just laughs, his friends laughing with him. You know, hell, I didn't mind the sport. I just remember that laughing. That and Vicky, standing off to the side, watching her fella knocking golf balls all over me. Vicky didn't laugh. Didn't even smile. She looked at me like she knew just the way I feel. That's love, comrade, at least that's where it starts. - Well, I don't think that Harmon Shaw cares much about love or anything else. - Least of all a dead nigger gal, right? Nobody cares. - What do you wanna do? - I wanna fuck him up. And I want you to help. - Cherry. Cherry. This is no time for wretched excess. - I'm just partying a little, that's all. I never went to a prom before. I bet you took Vicky. - I want you to focus, okay? - Cherry's on the case, baby. You ain't got nothin' to worry about. (light instrumental music) - [Waiter] Sir. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Ma'am. - Oh, whoa. Sorry. - That's quite alright, ma'am. - No man, I'll get it. - Thank you. You're gonna have to do a little better than that, okay? - This is fun. - Try not to wobble. (uptempo pop music) (chattering) Hi, Mom. You wouldn't happen to have some aspirin in your purse, would you? - Richter, I'd like you to meet somebody very special to me. Victor, this is my other son, Richter. - Vic Hill. - Hi, I'm the other son. You've heard all about me. - Yes, I have. - Thanks for redeveloping my house. - And who is this? - Oh, Mom, Victor, this is my friend, Cherry. - Cherry, pleased to meet ya. Richter has told me-- - Uh, what have you told me? - Nothing. - I think I'll just go freshen this up a little bit for you, honey. - Why? - Bye, Vic. - Well, I think I have to go say hello to my friends, the Winstons. - Mom and I have one of those special relationships that transcend the usual bonds of family. So, Billy, how do you like our new dad? - I like all our dads. - Say, I bet you can't drink that down like this. - [Cherry] Pee. - Uh, Cherry, have you met my brother, Billy? - Half brother. Nice to meet you. - Cherry needs some help finding the ladies' room. Billy, if you could... - [Billy] Oh, oh gladly. - Thank you. - [Woman] Thank you darlin'. - Hello, my mother left her medication in her coat. Can't seem to find the... Excuse me. Ronnie. Ronnie, you can't come in here. It's not cool. I've almost got the key. - [Cynthia] Richter. - It's okay, Mom, I got it. - I'm giving you an hour to meet me at Keith's house. You got that? - Okay. - You understand me on that? - [Richter] Yes. - No more bullshit. - Okay. - An hour. - Who was that? - Oh, just some guy from the golf course. I took care of it, Mom. Why, you've sure got a lot of gifts here. - Darlin' I will abide your girlfriend, but I draw the line at criminals.

(mumbling) (thudding) (mumbling) - Billy threw up on the rug. You think Billy will be alright? He was looking kinda green when we left. - Oh, I like Billy green. - Lucky for you we found this film. You ever see Ronnie when he gets angry? His eyes don't blink. - Yeah, well, we're not gonna go see Ronnie just yet. - What? - I said we're not gonna go see Ronnie just yet. - Where are we going? - Well, I got something to do. - God dammit, where are we going? - I gotta see Vicky first, okay? - Oh well, that's real optimistic, Richter. What do you have in mind? - I don't know. (melancholy music) - What is the (mumbling)? (mumbling on TV) What is the Rio Grande? Mississippi, oh fuck it. Come on, Alex. TV yes, thank you. I'll take TV for five million. Who's Ricky Ricardo? Thank you. Ever watch Jeopardy!? - No, not really. - Ronnie watches every night. Almost never gets a single answer,'cept state capitols. Funny thing is, he just keeps watching. He's real determined, that guy. That's why he came for me. Like I was the only thing on his mind. - You love him. - Imagine my surprise, huh? - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna sit here. I gotta wait for the round of champions. - You know what's weird? - [Vicky] What? - I never really thought about you and me. You know, I just knew it. At least I thought I did, but lately I've... It's like something I learned in high school, but it took me years to realize that it really had no practical application in the real world. - Well, that's real sweet, Richter. - Just hit me. - I guess I just liked the way you looked at me when we were kids. I did like that. - We were kids. - Yeah. - A favor. Don't go anywhere, not just yet. - Shit, I got that fortune wheel coming up next. Clem sleeps a solid 8, so... Ain't going nowhere. - Bye, baby. - Where is Mayberry? Where is Mayberry? I have no fuckin' idea. (tense music) - Cherry. Come on, wait up a minute, will ya? - [Cherry] Fuck off. - Listen, Cherry, I just wanna talk. - My name's not Cherry, it's Elinore. I don't need you, I don't need anybody. Me and Ronnie'll take care of this ourselves. After he rips your head off. - Dammit, what, that's not what's happening here. - Which is exactly what you deserve. Banging his wife. - Okay, come on. Elinore. - What? - Well, first of all, Tulsa is that way. You're going the wrong direction. - What else is new? - Well, you're wrong about Vicky. I was too. I kinda figured that Cherry was just your stage name. - Yeah well, Tiffany was overused and Chesty seemed inappropriate. - Elinore, huh? - I was named for my aunt. - Your Aunt Elinore? - Yeah. You want to hear about my whole family tree? - Well, yeah. Yes, I would. That'd be nice. - Earla was the only real friend I ever had. I mean, I had people to do shit together, but I never had someone I could count on before. I was hopin' I could count on you. (horn honking) - Drive with me, huh? Come on. We'll take that film to Ronnie. We'll make Bedford pay for what he did, you and me. (melancholy music) Come on, please. - [Cherry] Don't call me Elinore. Not yet. - [Richter] Ronnie? Ronnie, you won't believe this, but we finally-- - [Ronnie] Something puzzles me, Richt, do you know what that is? - No. - For the life of me, I can't figure out how Keith got our film. - Yeah, yeah, that is weird. I mean, I can see how it would appear that way, but you know, the strange thing is that-- - [Cherry] Keith took it. - Right. Right, but he knew. So, it's strange that Keith knew how important it was-- - So he decided to give it to you because that's where it belonged. - Instead of just giving it to me. You know, Keith. - Well, shit then. Guess I'll wrap this up, send it off to Harmon Shaw. Everybody gets rich. - That's great, Ronnie, but you know, why don't you give it to me, and I can wrap it up, send it off from the office. - Yeah, let Richter send it. That'll work. - Y'all wanna take a fucking vote? I think it's best if I take it from here. Richter might lose it again, ain't that right, Richter? - Yeah, uh, listen, Ronnie. About that film. That's not what you think it is. It's a long, strange story about what happened, but the important thing is-- - [Bedford] Nobody move! (laughing) - What's the matter, Bedford? You got your gun all crooked. - Give me the film. Give me the film and I won't shoot anybody. - You look a bit shaky to me, Bedford. Maybe you should have something to eat, huh? (crashing) - Ronnie, Ronnie, I think you should just give him the film. - Now, dammit, I'll shoot. I mean it! - Ain't that easy, killer. Defenseless girl, I guess that's one thing, but three at a time? I don't know, Bedford. Seems to me your reach has exceeded your grasp. - Alright. I'll shoot the whore first. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Go girl. - Hey. - Goddammit, give me the film. (gunshot blasting) - Nice shootin', Bedford. You murdered the lamp. - Just give him the film. It's not what you think it is. Just give it to him. - Yeah, Richter. What do you think it is? - Alright, I am going to count then. I'm going to count to ten-- - Just shut the fuck up. Here's the damn film. (tense music) Come and get it. - Give it here. - Come on over you sack of shit. - I'm warning you. - You beat Earla to death with a stick. Man like that oughta stand real tall. - Okay, guys, guys. - So why don't you just come and get it? - Hey. Okay? - Thank you, Richter. - You're welcome. - Pissant mother fucker. - Oh, what the hell. (clicking) (gunshot blasting) - What's that asshole doing in my dining room? - Whatever he was doing, he's done. - [Richter] Shit. - Now what? - Think fast, college boy. - What the fuck are you talkin', this, oh, shit. Okay, okay. Okay, this is what happened. Here's the story. Bedford Shaw came over to the house. He had a gun. He came over because he thought you had the film. You were upstairs watching TV and you heard him. You heard him because he broke in, here. (crashing) You grabbed your gun, naturally. You came downstairs, surprised him. He took a shot at you and you shot him in self defense. - What about the film? (tense music) - Cherry and I will take this film down to Brinkman at the Journal. Brinkman'll spread it all over the front page, and she'll have an eyewitness to back it up. Bedford Shaw, murderer, shot by local hero. We'll bury Harmon Shaw's good name with his son. You weren't here and you weren't here and neither was I. - What about my money? - Your money. Yeah. Money on it's own don't mean a damn thing. You oughta know that. (melancholy music) Vicky's waiting for you there. - Thank you, Richter. - Now. Can one of y'all tell me what the hell is going on here? - Yeah, I can do that. Started with a dead girl named Earla. Dear Brinkman. I hope this letter finds you. The local post office is well, sort of eccentric when it comes to the whole mail delivery concept. Cherry and I came down here after the hearing. Sometimes, when I think about it, I can still see Harmon Shaw sitting in the back of the courtroom like an angry god stunned that his subjects had conjured up the nerve to defy him. That, and Keith in the spotlight he always deserved. Every town needs a gunslinger, I guess. The days are hot here, the nights are cool. I started to write about what happened that week, but then I didn't. Right now, sunrise and sunset are enough. Well, that and the frequent margarita. I'm a long way from home, Cherry is too. We intend to figure that out together. Please send money. Just kidding. Richter. (melancholy music) (uptempo music) (melancholy music) (uptempo music)
