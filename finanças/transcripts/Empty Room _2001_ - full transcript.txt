Hello. Excuse me, but I live next door. I had an urge to just walk into any old apartment. Do you live here? I see. This one's vacant. Sachiko Kuroda from the third floor. I'm sorry. What were you doing here? - Nothing. Excuse me. Did you hear it? I bet you could hear the noise. That was my wife. She meets that man in broad daylight. I came to yell at them, but I had no courage to open the door. I couldn't walk in on them. So I just kept on listening. Then I had a sudden urge to walk into another apartment. This room has so much afternoon sun. Here they go again. That man has no limit. Where have you been? - Nowhere. Do you want to it now? Would you mind massaging my back? Yes, right there. - Is that better? What's wrong? Sachiko? Let's have sex. Let's do it. This room has so much afternoon sun. But it's been so long. I said no. Sorry. What's going on? - Sorry. Did I wake you? It's the middle of the night. I suddenly wanted to know if this dress still fits me. I had to squeeze into it, but it's still okay. Don't be silly and go to bed. I have to wake up early. Going somewhere? - Yes. I'm waiting for my wife's lover. I want to see what he looks like. In the beginning I was snooping around and hiding. I've been pretending to go to work every morning. I went to a coffee shop instead. But I've had enough of it. Eventually I got fired, you see? So now I can sit here waiting for that man. Well, I have to go. Where are you going? Shopping? - Something like that. Can I come with you? I'm waiting for my wife's lover. I want to see what he looks like. When the girl's picture changes, it's the jackpot. Okay. So you won't get tired. What's this? What's happening? Isn't it incredible? How easy it was to win. You can say that. It's very easy to lose too. Don't you have to go home? - No, I don't. He stays out late drinking too. And I hit the jackpot, so it's okay. My wife's so different from you. She doesn't care what I do or where I go. Really? She says: 'l do what I please, so you can too.' But she's gone too far. - You should tell her that. I know I should, but... Let's dance. - No, not yet. Come on. You are late. - I'm sorry. Were you drinking? - Yes. What else? - I went out dancing. With whom? - A friend. Who? - Kobayashi. You've never gone out drinking before. Just this one time. Isn't it okay? You're drinking too. Sachiko. Come over here. - Yes? What's going on? Is anything wrong 7 Tell me. I just wanted to dance. - I can't dance because my back hurts. I know. I understand that but... I just wondered if this was going to be it. Nothing going on and I just get older little by little. Then once day I won't be able to dance any more. I'm sorry. Come here. Kiss me. - Why? Why now? You said you wanted to. - Not today, because... What? - Wait a minute. Were you with a man? - No, I wasn't. Put a rubber on. It's okay if you get pregnant. Is it okay? Is it really? Ah, so good. What's wrong? - My back. Are you okay? Don't worry. Just don't move. Just stay still. What is it? ls there something you want to tell me? Where are you going so late? - Wherever I want. Is it him? - Get yourself a woman too. I think you've gone too far. What's this? Didn't we agree to do whatever pleases us? Have you forgotten? Is this really what you want? I'm home. What are you doing? What's happened? You're late again. You are drunk too. I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have, but dancing can be so addictive. Are you upset? Don't lie. I saw you with a man. Say something. What are you doing behind my back? - I told you. I went to dance. Don't you lie to me. Who is that man? Who is he? Mr. lshii from the fifth floor. Come with me. - Wait a minute. We're going to talk to that lshii. - Wait a minute. Please don't. Kuroda from the third floor. Yes? - Sorry to bother you so late at night. But we need to talk. We just went out dancing. - Just get over here. Why don't you come inside? It's getting late. Don't you feel ashamed? Going out with my wife. I'm sorry. But we just danced. That's all. We didn't do anything else. I can't believe you. - It's true. We didn't do anything wrong. He's right. What's wrong with that? What did you plan to do once you got her drunk? Nothing. - You're rude. Apologize to him. Anyhow... this is wrong. What are you going to do now? I won't see her. - Of course you won't. Why shouldn't they? Why can't wives meet other men? Is her husband the only man she's allowed? Isn't it boring? I'd be lonely enough to die. What are you talking about? Go ahead. Meet with my husband. You don't need to worry. What's an affair or two? What's wrong with it? One man. Too boring. Hello, this is the Kurodas. Sorry about last night. I shouldn't have come here. What good does it do to listen to their lovemaking? There's nothing I can do about this. You heard her last night. I'm sorry to have you meet me here. It's okay. It's too rude to tell me never to see you. I wanted to see you too. Listening to my wife and her lover... I suddenly had to see you. I thought I would take advantage of you if you came. I thought everything would be okay then. I wanted to make them listen to our noise. Just how much sillier could I get? What do you say? Maybe just a kiss? I'm sorry. I can't. Oh yes. Do you know why being on buses makes you feel sleepy? Don't you just love the ocean? Would you jump in for me? Maybe I'll dive in. Why? - I just feel like it. Let's not do it. Okay. We don't want to get wet. But I think I could jump in. It's dangerous. You scared me to death. Thank you very much. I hate old men who get sick after too much alcohol. They should all be shot to death. What do you want? - You really make me sick. What are you saying? - Don't you have better things to do? Don't you have a home to go to? Come on. Get up and go. Go away. You're thinking: How much do I have to pay to screw her? No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. No, not particularly. - Not at all? Just a little? Maybe a little. They should all be shot to death. Get off me, dirty old man. You're scum. It was nice of you to pay for the hotel, but you just wanted to get laid. You men are all filthy. I'm sorry. I know it's my fault. I apologize. But you followed me. That means only one thing. It means you'd sleep with me. That's what anybody would think. Who would just pay for the hotel and leave? I know you took advantage of me because I look like a sucker. Is this how you've been living? You sleep with men so you can sleep on a bed? I'm right, aren't I? Shut you mouth. Who do you think you are, you scum. Go away, filthy old man. Leave some money. How much? -10,000 yen. You're home. You came back late. Where have you been? I called home many times but nobody answered. Is this how you've been living? Close the door. It's cold. You were with him again. - Close the door please. You met him again. - Close the door. So did you see him? Did you see him? Sachiko, answer me. Yes, I saw him. I'm sorry. Don't. You lied to me. You promised not to see my wife again. But you did. Why? It was me who went to see him. So it wasn't his fault. I went to see him. Is that true? I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Your wife is just a victim of my selfishness. I'm so sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't apologize. We made love. Don't apologize for that. Are you okay there? - Yes. You look bad. I'm very low. - Low are you. Why don't we go to a hotel? We can get a morning discount. We can sleep on a nice bed. We won't talk about being low. We'll pretend that law's okay. We can pretend to be nice to each other. I don't know what to do either. But I think it's all right. Sleep tight. You just came home. How can you keep it up? Aren't you going to work? Didn't you know I was fired long ago? I've been bumming around for a month. Where did you go every morning? - I was just pretending. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I'm taking a nap. Why are you always like that? - Like what? Why don't you look at me when I talk to you? Come over here. I don't know what to do. Don't you have anywhere to go? I'll pay for the hotel. Come with me. - Leave me alone. This is all I have on me. You want to get laid? - Suck my dick, please. Filthy assholes. Men are all the same. Take it or leave it. I'll take it. It's totally useless. Feel them. Come on, squeeze them. Now it's getting hard. I have you now. Sachiko. Ishii. Good morning. I didn't think you'd be here. - My wife wants to leave me now. I don't know anything any more. - Why don't we go away? Excuse me, some gasoline please. My car's out of gas. Do you have a container? - A what? A tank, bucket or anything. If not, we can't sell you gas. Don't you sell containers? - Sorry, but no. What should I do? - There's a supermarket 3 km away. Sorry about that. Isn't the real thing great? - Yes, and waves too. What are you doing? Ocean. Come and jump in, lshii. No, I won't. - You have to. Okay, okay. It's the ocean. The ocean. Let's have lots of sex. Do it hard and rough. Bite me. Pound on me. I want to break. Oh, God. I'm hard again. Give me more. Give me more, please. Coming. Come in my mouth. Did you swallow it? He won't come home. He's with your wife. So stupid, isn't it? Do it again. I can't do it any more. - We'll do it. I can't get it hard. What a big bottom. I'm going to urinate. - Yeah? Piss then. Pour it on my face. Okay. Let's go home. - No, I won't. Let's go. No. I don't want this to end. Not like this. No. Not like this. No. I'm home. What's happened to you? - Wait a minute. Don't move. If you touch me even a bit, I'll collapse. Help me up. Little by little. Slowly. Okay?
