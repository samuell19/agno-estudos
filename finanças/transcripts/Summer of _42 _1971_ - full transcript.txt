When i was 15 And my family came to the island for the summer, There weren't nearly as many houses or people As there are now. The geography of the island And the singularity of the sea Were far more noticeable then. If a guy wasn't to die of loneliness, His family made certain That other families from his neighborhood Contributed other kids to the island. Look out, hermie! Is he playing? Look out. Present with me in the summer of '42 were Oscy, my best friend, And benjie, My next-To-Best friend. We called ourselves The terrible trio. And that house up there... That was her house. Nothing from that first day i saw her And no one that has happened to me since Has ever been as frightening And as confusing. For no person i've ever known Has ever done more To make me feel more sure, More insecure... More important... And less significant. He's going to take her Right into that bedroom. Better put the wood down first. Ahh... funny. Hey, come on! Oscy, for christ's sakes! Hey, come on, hermie! Will you move your ass? Give it back, oscy! Ha ha ha! Oh, no! Ha ha ha! Boy, i'd like to feel Every one of those girls. You know... I should have tripped on them. They'd never know i was getting a feel. That's not how to do it. So, what's the way to do it? You have to say things. Alright. I'll say, "excuse me." You know what i mean. You can't just fall on a girl. It isn't done. Why not? I did it with gladys potter. She was only 12. What did she know? I don't know. Didn't seem to mind, though. Well, she was surprised. So was i. Nothing to feel. Hey, come on, benjie. Stop dragging. I don't know what's going to become of him. He has no emotions. Aw, he's just confused. Yeah. Yeah, so am i. I've been waking up lately In the middle of the night. A lot. Yeah, that's ok. I do, too. You do? Yeah. Yeah, but... I wake up feeling crazy And thinking about vera miller. So what? So i hate vera miller. Jesus! You think i'm in love with her? Gee, i don't know. God, i hope i'm not in love with her. I hate her. Well, what kind of thoughts Do you have about her? I forget. Then how can i help you? Who the hell's asking for help? What are you talking about? Nothing you'd understand. Ah, screw you! That's your whole problem, benjie. You're only interested in screwing me. Try screwing a girl. Ok! "Ok," he says. You wouldn't know the first thing to do. Would so! Ok, what's the first thing you do? You feel them! Wrong! You kiss them. We didn't kiss gladys potter! We weren't in love with gladys potter. You're in love, with a girl You should kiss a girl first. Ain't that right hermie? It's polite. It's not required. It's required, you ninny. It is not. How do you know? Because i found a book. If my mother knew i took that book It doesn't belong to me. It doesn't belong to my mother. It belongs to the house. If you get fingerprints on those pages, It's your funeral. My mother's gonna miss that book. It's the biggest on the shelf. Books fell as i pulled it out. Hold it. Hurry up! Kill me, i don't read as fast as you. Ok, turn. Jesus! Do you believe this stuff? Yeah. It's a medical journal. Why should they lie? How do they take pictures like that? They must have special cameras. What drugstores would develop them? If we took them in, we'd be in reform school. I guess they developed them themselves. Yeah. I guess that's it. Let me look. You'll foam at the mouth. It's my book! Let him look. There! They're doing it! I don't believe it! You'd better. One day your turn's gonna come. And you better know what to do. My parents never did that! Never! Why not? Because it's stupid. Hate to break the news, But that's how it's done. Stop pushing me around. It could be dangerous. It looks dumb in the pictures, But when you're in love, It should be very pleasant. How do you know? You've never done it. It's here in the book! In black and white! That's why people kiss first-- They get to know each other. Then they're in love. Then they make-- Foreplay! It's called foreplay. Everyone gets undressed, and they play foreplay. He does this, She does this, and he does this, And before you know it, they're screwing! What could be simpler than that? Listen. Before i saw these pictures, I didn't think it was possible, But these are pictures, benjie, pictures! These aren't drawings. I've seen them. These are pictures! In emergency, it could mount, oh... .350-Caliber jobs, Probably handle about... A dozen or so depth charges. Ah, it'd sink if it hit a fish. Stripped down, it could do 30, 40 knots. Yeah, 30 or 40 knots! 30 or 40 knots! Straight down! Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... ...22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0, 11, 12... Â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª ...18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30... ...35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40... 44, 45, 46, 47... ...51, 52, 53... I wish somebody Would invade this dopey island! I'm going mad! Mad. Hey. Hey, oscy, it's that lady again. Aw, hermie, you're not going to go Into another deathlike trance again, are you? I swear, hermie. What's come over you? That's a very old person over there. I don't see the attraction. Maybe it's her mind. Maybe their minds meet and say hello. Why don't you go say hello to her mind? Go on, go say hello. Cut it out. If she's the love of you're life, Go say hello. We want to see you. Maybe you're a hotshot lover we don't know about. Cut it out. Knock it off! Go say hello to her. Come on, go say hello! Yeah! Go say hello! We want to see you. Go say hello to her! Hey, lady in the pink suit! It's hermie the rape artist! It's jack the ripper! It's herman the german! Nazi spy! It's a sex fiend!

And time magazine for your father. Jesus. Ow! Oh! May i offer some assistance? Oh, yes, you may. I really didn't expect to buy so much. I should have brought my wagon. Yeah, you should have brought your wagon. Yes. What you really need is a wagon. I think you're right. I can take one. No, it's ok. If we both take some, we can manage. I'll happily pay you. I wouldn't think of it. My house is pretty far. I know where it is. You do? Yeah. It's that way. Are you sure it's ok? Yeah, it's ok. Won't you let me take one? No. Oh, no. Do you live on the island? In the summer. With your family? Yeah. But they don't bother me. I pretty much go my own way. Aren't they pretty? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I couldn't resist. I got a 12-Page letter today. Oh? That's nice. It sure is. Hey, hermie! Somebody called you. Not me. Is your name hermie? Yeah. Well, somebody back there called you. No, not me. Well, he called hermie. Well, hermie's a pretty common name. Oh.

Would you like some? Sure. Great. Sit down. Ooh, these are marvelous doughnuts. Help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. You drink coffee, don't you? I consume a couple of cups a day. Well, i have milk. Oh, no. I take it black. Are you in high school? I'm a sophomore. I thought you were older. Next year i'll be a junior, and so on. Don't be in a hurry. You may end up in the army. I'm prepared to go. I'm taking preflight courses In high school. I guess i'll get my wings. Maybe i can team up with my brother. He's a paratrooper. Maybe i can drop him out. So your brother's a paratrooper. Yeah. Mostly i have a sister in high school. Coffee's ready. I hope it's alright. It's from this morning. It looks fine. I have a little bit of sugar.

You were in there a long time. Could have been out in 10 seconds. What happened? We had drinks. You're kidding! He had drinks. Big deal. She let you get funny? Oh, you're a dope. An older woman like that? What's a little feel to her? She let you have a feel? She gave me some doughnuts. Probably stinks from perfume. Grow up. What happened in there all that time? I wasn't aware of the time. It flew quickly. I'd like to give her a feel. I thought you were mature, oscy. It's mature to feel girls. My brother does it. Then how come he's a dentist? Hey, don't be such a big shot, And don't tell us Something went on with that lady. I ain't telling you anything. Which is the same as telling us A lot went on. Screw you. I ain't saying something happened If nothing happened. Nothing happened. If you believe something happened, I'm sorry for you Because nothing happened. Jesus! I didn't even know her name. You expect us to believe that? I don't care what you believe. I'm going home. My father's waiting for his time magazine. Going home? Yeah, going home. I got a few things to think over.

I'm squeezing the crap out of miriam When the lights go out. You're really something. You can't even wait till after the cartoon. I can't wait. I can't wait. Silly name, isn't it? My father named me after a professor He was fond of. I was j.D. In college. My wife calls me j. Duveaux. I'm jerry to my friends. Now, won't you tell me who you are? My name is vale, v-A-L-E. On the passenger list, It will be c. Vale, boston. Stop it. Are you one of the vales of boston? One of the lesser ones. Which one? Is it miss or mrs.? It's aunt. Every family has one, you know. But aunt what? My name is charlotte vale. Miss charlotte vale. It was like a miracle happening, Like having your child. Stop it! Alright, alright. I even allowed myself to indulge in the fantasy That both of us loving her In doing what was best for her together, Would make her seem like our child after a while. I see no such fantasy has occurred to you. Again, i've been a sentimental fool. It's a tendency i have. Wait a minute. I was afraid you were keeping tina Out of pity, But there was no pity In your ridicule of me just now. Now, i know you still love me. And, it won't die, what's between us. Do what you will-- Ignore it, neglect it, starve it. Stop it! ...both of us together. Please let me go. Oh, charlotte. Please let me go. Jerry... Dr. Jackworth knows about us. When he said i could take tina, He said, "you're on probation." Do you know what that means? It means i'm on probation Because of you and me. He allowed this visit as a test. If i can't stand such tests, I'll lose tina, and we'll lose each other. Jerry, please help me. Shall we just have a cigarette on it? Yes. May i sometimes come here? Whenever you like. It's your home, too. The people here love you. I look at you and tina And see everything peace and contentment. Of course. And just think, It won't be for this time only. That is, if you'll help me keep what we have. We'll both try to protect That little strip of territory that's ours. We can talk about your child. Our child. Thank you. And will you be happy, charlotte? Oh, jerry, don't let's ask For the moon. We have the stars. Where do you live? You live off the point? Let's go to the beach And watch the surf roll in. No, we really have to go. Ah, come on. No. Maybe, we'll see it on the beach tomorrow? Will you be on the beach tomorrow? I won't be on a mountain. Then we'll see you. Bye. Yeah, bye. Come on. How'd you make out? Pretty good. What did you do? I held her breast. You didn't. For almost 11 minutes. Fantastic! 11 full minutes. You timed it. Yeah. The longest i ever got Was eight minutes with lila harrison. So you broke your record. By three minutes. What did it feel like? What do you mean? It felt like a breast. Didn't it feel like an arm? An arm? No, it felt like a breast. I'll bet it felt like an arm. Why like an arm? Because it was an arm. What's the matter with you? You were feeling her arm. That's what i was trying to tell you. You squeezed an arm for 11 minutes. The eight-Minute record With lila harrison still stands. God damn it, you're lying. I wouldn't lie about an arm, hermie. An arm. Jesus, i was passing out, And it was an arm. Yeah... a very lovely arm. Well, you're a son of a bitch. What? Why didn't you let me think It was a breast? I thought you should know So you wouldn't make that mistake again. You wanted to ruin my memory of it. What do i care If you spend your life squeezing arms? I thought you should face reality, Especially if you're timing it And going for records. I guess you're right. Oh, god! How can i ever face her again? Make sure she's wearing long sleeves. Ha ha ha! An arm. An 11 -Minute arm. Ha ha! An arm. Oh, god. Lila harrison, your record's safe! Ha ha ha! Lila harrison. Oh, jesus! "Nothing is too heavy When love is in the air." "Laughter becomes you." "Coffee is exquisite." Exquisite? Is that you, hermie? It is i. Come on in. The door's open. I'll be out in a minute. Why don't you sit down? I certainly will... I shall. Well... Hi. Hi. We'll have the coffee later, alright? Yeah. Ok. Your coffee's exquisite. Thank you. I hope it wasn't an inconvenience For you to come by. It's ok. What's up there? Dust. Oh. May i see? Sure. Oh, there's lots of room. We shouldn't have any trouble. Thank you. You're right. There's lots of dust. Laughter becomes you. I guess the best thing to do Is hand you the boxes one at a time. Don't you think? Yeah, ok. Great. How are you doing? Fine. Hermie, what's wrong? Are you alright? Yeah. Well, your leg is shaking. I don't think your ladder's too good. Do you want me to hold it? I think you better hand me another box. Oh. Just two more. That's it. Come on down. Good job. Yeah. This time you really must let me Give you some money. No, i couldn't take it. I couldn't possibly have gotten those boxes Up there myself. It's ok. I like you. That's very sweet of you, hermie. I like you, too. I mean, i don't like many people. Hermie! Hey, hermie! Come on! Come on, will you? Hurry up. Get up here. Come on. What happened? Ah, nothing. What went on in there ? Nothing. Come on, try to remember. Well, the way it went, We went in and chatted. Yeah. Then i put the boxes in the attic. Then she kissed me. Kissed you? Yeah. Right here. See any lipstick? Jesus, he's right. Lipstick. No. That's blood. It's a mosquito bite. No, that's definitely lipstick. Oscy, i like her kissing me, not you. It's blood. She's a god damn vampire. As i left, I'm sure she asked me to come back... Anytime. You know, hermie, I really think you struck gold. I really do. Benjie, we'll need the book again. You drooled on it before. I'll get blamed for warped pages. My glasses for the book. You'll have fun Identifying enemy aircraft. You'll be a hero. Nothing flies over this island Except birds. Maybe they're enemies. No go. It's a fair swap. Keep the glasses for two days. What's more, if you don't, I'll break your nose. Aw, come on. Come on, hermie! In the name of america, I award you these glasses. Hey, benjie, come on. Hurry up, hurry up. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Wait. Shh. Come on. And now backstage wife, The beloved story of mary noble, Now mary noble, war wife, As her husband larry, a former broadway star, Is now lieutenant noble... Ok, come on. Shh. Somewhere in the south pacific. You'll recall That when we last heard from larry... Were stranded on an island After their boat had been wrecked... Come on. Mrs. Larson didn't. She didn't, but now she does. Now she does use duz. Mrs. Larson knows... Duz does everything in her wash. She's convinced this new kind of soap... It's even improved her disposition. She used to be... Watch that step. Ok, ok. You wouldn't dirty up so many towels If you had to wash them. And she'd tell her daughter. I know your rayon undies Don't look bright anymore... Come on, come on. But then mrs. Larson discovered duz... Hermie, i just cleaned in there. God damn it. Where's the paper? It's in the drawer. Where's the carbon paper? In there. What are you doing? I'm making two copies, one for me and one for you. Keep it with you and learn it. What for? You can't call on your lady with a book. I'm condensing it. Point by point. Just stay close to this. You'll do ok. Oscy, i'm troubled. I think i have a deep feeling for her. So what? I don't want to just lay her. I respect her. There's something you have to understand. It's alright to respect her, But she won't respect you If you don't try to lay her. I don't believe that. It's true. My brother told me. That's the way ladies are. They want you to try even if they don't let you. Because even though they don't let you, they want you to. I think i understand. Good. Then you can start memorizing. Oh, this is crazy. What? Point 3. What's crazy about it? I've never heard of the word. Latin--The original guys were latins. I wouldn't know how to pronounce it. You don't pronounce it, you just do it. I don't know where it is. What the hell is this in number 4? That's latin, too. It's all in latin, hermie. I may have to ask where these things are. They're all approximately in the same place. "Seek and ye shall find." Besides, she's supposed to help you out. I hope so. I'll need all the help i can get. Point 6, hermie-- Very important. Foreplay. Right. That word keeps cropping up. Well, i still don't know what to do. What do i say? "How about a little foreplay?" You don't have to say a word. Oh, yeah? Point 2 states we should converse. When you get to point 6, there's no more talking, Just moaning and sighing. Just moan and sigh. Well, she'll think i'm sick. She'll be moaning and sighing, too. It's going to get noisy. I got news on miriam today. A lifeguard told me. Once she gets started, she's supposed to be something. I'm home, hermie. If i follow these 12 points, She might have a kid. I can't afford a kid, At this stage. So the whole thing's off. Hermie, you are really dumb. I may be dumb, but i won't be a father. Two wrongs, don't make a right. You use protection. You use a rubber. Haven't you heard of a rubber? Course i have. Ok, that's what you use. I have mine. When my brother went into the service, He willed it to me. I've been carrying it ever since. It's my lucky charm. How much for it? Hey, it's from my brother. It's a family heirloom. Get your own. Go to the drugstore. I won't risk it. I'm underage. Also, women shop in drugstores.

Can i see it? Why don't you just have Another marshmallow? Oh, alright. Hermie! Hermie! Would you excuse me again? Yes. You're very kind. What? Give me a rubber. What happened to your heirloom? It was spoiled. I guess they don't keep. Come on. For pete's sake! Come on. It's cold. Don't you even say thank you? Thank you, hermie. Why did miriam say thank you? Because she's a lady. Oh, i see. See what? Pardon? You said you saw. What did you see? Oh, actually nothing. Then don't say you see When you don't. Ok. Psst! Need a rubber? I need a breather. I also need another rubber. Did you get to point 12 yet? 12? Hermie, we're so far past 12. But that's as far as the book goes. What's after 12? Well... there's 13... And 14... And 15... Hermie, you have no idea. And 16...

Don't plan on it. No. Getting late. I've got to get to the post office And get these letters off. I'll run them down for you. No, thanks. It's tricky postage, Overseas and all. Thanks anyway. Hello! I don't even know your name. Oh, dorothy. I had a cat named dorothy. It got hit by a truck. Bye! Hi. You know what? What? It's all over. What? Me and miriam. What happened? I'm embarrassed to tell you. Then don't tell me. You won't believe it. After last night, i'll believe anything. No. It's not what you think. Look, oscy. I'm in kind of a hurry. We had an argument this afternoon. I went over to her house to apologize. She's got appendicitis. Took her over to the mainland. Hope they leave her there. I hope they don't cut up her boobs. I don't think the scar goes that far. She told me she's breaking our date. The next thing i know, appendicitis. She goes to extremes. They loaded her on the speedboat on a stretcher. Maybe it's all for the better. How can you say such a dumb thing? Because i'm not really interested. Bullshit. You're interested. You took a long look at us last night. We knew you were looking. I only caught a glimpse. Will you shut up oscy. I don't want to hear your dirty details. You don't want me to tell you? I don't wanna hear about it. I was gonna tell you everything. Don't. When you want to hear, i won't tell you. Good. Something's wrong with you. You're not normal. Good. Going to her house? Screw you. Got your instructions handy? It won't be like that. You wouldn't understand it. Because you're so crass. Crass? What the hell is crass? Just leave me alone. What are you so mad about? I don't know! Got your rubbers? You're a regular comedian. You know what? I'm sorry i tried to help you. That makes two of us. I gave you my binoculars to get you educated. Word's getting out you're a homo. If you don't cut it out, You'll get a fat lip! Ah! Homo! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Dorothy, it's hermie, Hermie from the beach. Hi, hermie. Hi. I don't look very nice, do i? I think you do. I think i don't. I'm sorry. Good night, hermie. Good night. Miriam pulled through. I talked to her mother this morning. Jesus. They didn't even operate. They froze her. I'm relieved about it. But she's through for the summer. Won't be back on the island again. My first lay... gone with the wind. Hey, have you seen benjie anywhere? That rat still has my glasses. Hey, you know, you shouldn't feel so bad, No matter what happened. You don't have to tell me. But if you want to tell me, you can. You don't have to unless you want to. Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass. Hey, i thought maybe we'd attack The coast guard station tonight. You know, give them a scare? "Dear hermie, i must go home now. "I'm sure you'll understand. "There's much i have to do. "I won't try and explain what happened last night "Because i know that, in time, "You'll find a proper way in which to remember it. "What i will do is remember you, "And i pray that you be spared all senseless tragedies. "I wish you good things, hermie, "Only good things. Always, dorothy. " I was never to see her again, Nor was i ever to learn what became of her. We were different then. Kids were different. It took us longer to understand the things we felt. Life is made up of small comings and goings And for everything we take with us, There is something that we leave behind. In the summer of '42, We raided the coast guard station four times. We saw five movies and had nine days of rain. Benjie broke his watch, oscy gave up the harmonica, And in a very special way I lost hermie... forever.
