Robert. Robert. Hello, Robert. Your arrival indicates that you've realized what an honor it is to be chosen as one of the delta boys. It is an honor, isn't it, boys? Always. Oh, yeah. It's a big honor. Unfortunately, my friend, it isn't easy becoming one of us. First, you must prove that you're worthy. In order to become an official member of the delta boys, you must first kill a member of the school. It can be anyone. Anyone you choose. Oh, poor Robert. Alright, come on, buddy. You didn't think we were serious, did you? Just like, uh, you didn't think we were serious about having you in our fraternity. Afraid not, Robbie. We called you down here, man, for a, oh, good old-fashioned geek bashing. Come on, boys, let's have some fun. Robbie. Oh, my god! Go, go, go! Robert! Hey, baby. Hey, check this out. Hey, Becky, uh, it looks as if you're a little behind in your work. Oh, ho-ho-ho. Just want to see if maybe you needed a hand or, uh, something else? I'm alright. Thank you. Ooh! Right on. Oh, bro, that was funny, man. Come on. Loser. Becky, I can't be a very good counselor if you don't tell me what's on your mind. My parents are going away for Christmas. Well, that's nice. Nice? They're leaving me here. I mean, I hate this place. And I'm stuck here for Christmas. They're just doing it so that they don't have to be bothered with me. Oh, why would you say that? Because it's true. Ever since I was little, my parents have never really had time for me. My dad was never home. My mom was always busy with her charities. When the committee ladies came over, my mom would put me up in my room so that I wouldn't get in the way. Becky, have you tried telling your parents that you're not very happy here? It doesn't matter to them. They live their own lives. They don't even know that I'm pre-med. As long as I stay out of the way, they're fine. Becky, you're a lovely and smart girl, and it's important that we try to find a way to make you happy here. But, mom, why can't I? I could go home now, and then after Christmas break, I could start at community college. I... I know it's your vacation, but I promise I won't be a bother. I'll stay out of the way. What? You and dad are going away for Christmas? W-what about me? Yeah, okay. Fine. Bye. [Sighing] This leads to somewhere in the college. [Boys shouting] What's going on? I feel different. Was that Becky? I think so. God, she looks so different. Yeah, like almost doable. Please, that's pathetic. A little makeup, you guys will screw anything. Come on, girls. Oh, I'm sorry, Becky. I didn't mean to scare you. Are you alright? Oh, yeah. I think I just have a bit of a headache. Hmm. Well, you look like you could use a little break. Would you like to join me for a little walk? It might relax you a bit. I, you know, I-I told you. I've got a lot of work to do before the end of term. Alright. Well, have a nice day. Oh, Becky. You look nice with your hair down. Maybe you could try a little makeup. You know, just a little mascara or something. It will bring out your eyes. Hey, Becky. Oh, my god. I can't believe the delta party's in a few weeks. Who am I going to go with? Relax, krista, we're gonna hook you up tonight. Yeah, there's always a ton of hot guys at the rhino. What about you, Nicki? You know you got to finally make your big move on Matt. Hmm, I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready. Come on, Nick. You've been, like, pining since beginning of term. Just do it. It's not that easy. I mean, he's like the most popular guy in school. Um, she's right, you know. We're not all hooked-up like you, Meg. Sean is such a hottie. You're so lucky. Though I did catch him checking out that Becky girl today. Yeah, what's with that? Did you see her? Talk about a makeover. Whatever. Like I'm worried about Becky. Really. Hey, Becky. What are you up to tonight? Me? Nothing. A couple of us are going down to the campus pub, so if you wanna come by... Come on, guys. I don't want to wait in line, alright. Maybe we'll see you later. [Door closes] Hello? Hello? Hi there, Becky. We were just, uh, looking for you. You're not supposed to be in here. Oh, come on, Becky. Don't tell me that you've never broken the rules before. I mean, you looked so good today, I just couldn't stop thinking about you. I think that you should go. Oh, come on, Becky. You don't want to hang out with us? I mean, come on. You can't tell me you've never wanted to be with us. Stop. Please, stop. Why? Doesn't this feel good? [In a male's voice] You know what else would feel good? You know what, man? Forget this. Megan's waiting for me, anyway. Come on. Freak. Where were you guys last night? We waited for you, like, an hour. Sean wanted to see if he could score with that Becky chick. No way. How did that go? She is screwed up, man. Besides, we weren't really trying anyway. I don't believe you, man. You were shot down by barky Becky? Hey, man, she's looking hot. Definitely a bloomer. Yeah. Don't worry about it, man. You still got Megan. I hope you want a piece of that. Hey, girls, less gossip, alright? I wanna get into a real workout here. Alright, let's turn it up. Alright, Matt, on your back. I'll spot you. Yeah. One more, Matt. It feels very hard. Come on, Matt, keep going. Pick up the pace a little bit, buddy. Oh, yeah. Awesome. That's right. All the way up. You're weakening on me. Let's go. Come on, Matt. You ain't a wuss. Let's go. [In a male's voice] And now, it begins. Aah! Come on, Matt. Aah! Sean. What's up, man? Come on. Get it off. What happened? What? What the hell? Check his pulse. Sean? Sean? Jesus. I think he's dead. Oh, god. Did you know Sean? Not really. Well, if you ever need to talk about it... I said I didn't really know him. Alright. So, have you decided what you're going to do for your Christmas holiday? I'm going to be here. What other choice do I have? Well, good. Looks like I'll have company then. Turns out my son will be celebrating Christmas overseas. So, I figured I'd stay on campus. What about your husband? My husband and I have been divorced for over eight years now. It's alright. John and I thought we'd be better off apart as friends. Is that an old halston ring? I don't know. Well, I think it is. Hmm. 1975. That's the year I started working here. Is it one of your parents'? No, I found it. Look, I better go. I've got a lot of work. Uh... look, Becky, I know you really don't like coming here, and I know the students here think it's kind of geeky to visit a school counselor, but trust me, it's always nice to have someone you can talk to. Poor Megan. I mean, I don't know how she's gonna deal. And I hear she's not coming back after Christmas break. What? And miss the party? Nicki. Nicki. Sorry. It's just I never had anyone I knew died before. I guess it doesn't even seem that real. Well, one thing's for sure. We have to give the boys of our brother fraternity as much support as we can. Uh-hmm. Definitely. God, she looks so... I don't know. Different. You know, I heard, just before Sean died, that he and Derek tried to get it on with her. Get out. Really? What happened? Nothing, I think. Good thing Megan didn't find out. Hey, Becky. What are you doing? I said the boys need as much support as we can give them. What are you doing later? Nothing. Why? Well, the boys have a soccer practice later. We're going. You know, give them a little encouragement after what happened. Why don't you join us? Sure. Alright. Good. We'll see you then. Do you really wanna hang out with her? She's not that bad. Just kinda lost. Hmm. Oh, god. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you alright? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Here. How's Mrs. Gordon doing? What? Oh, no, it's... it's alright. Um, I used to see her a bit when I first got here. She's nice. I'm sorry about your friend. Thanks. It's weird. You never think something like that could happen. You know, especially to a guy like Sean. Hey, um, a couple of us are gonna go grab a drink after practice tomorrow night. You know, kinda raise a glass for Sean. Why don't you come? Actually, I was already gonna go check out your practice. Krista and those guys. Great. Well, then I guess I'll just see you then. Okay. Come on, you pass it to me. Let's go. Up. Up. Matt, over here. Okay. I don't think that we should serve anything with mayonnaise in it. That's like salmonella waiting to happen. I agree. But what about my dip? Everybody loves my bread bowl. Oh, I'm so through with carbs. Oh, me, too. You guys could always just use sour cream and put it in some hallowed fruit. Do for her charity functions. What a great idea. Thanks, Becky. Attaboy! Okay, over here. Here we go. Up. Up. Let's go, guys. Hey, let's go, buddy. Craig, come on. Control it. Control it, boy. Oh, my god. Did you see that? Dougie was just totally checking you out. I think he has the hots for you, Becky. I don't think so. He just totally gave you the three-second stare. Great. Why can't I get Matt to do one? Maybe because you're making it too obvious. Try being more subtle. Like Becky. Hey, Dougie, let's get back in the game. Come on. Let's go. Yeah. Go up. Let's go. Get that guy. Good. Block it. Pass it over. That's it. Pass it up, guys. Come on. Matt, go long. Yeah, right on. Aah! Oh, my god. Huh! Shit! Derek! Derek. Come on, buddy. What happened? Are you okay? Oh, my goodness. Oh, my god! Oh, my goodness. Come on, please get up. Will somebody call 911? Derek! [Speaking in a male's voice] You will all pay. Students of halston college. As most of you set out for the Christmas break, I just wanted to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tragic events which have occurred at the school in the last week. Though the holidays are meant for cheer, not sorrow, I hope you will all take a moment on the break to talk to someone about the recent deaths of two of our students, Sean Bradford and Derek Johnson. If you would like further counseling, my door is always open. I hope you all have a much-deserved holiday. [Church bells ringing] I don't believe it. Really, I am the only person here. R-y-h. [Thunder] [Door creaking] [Thunder] What are you doing in here? Nothing. I... I just found this ring in my room, and I thought I'd see who it belonged to so that maybe I could return it. You're in the east dorm, room 12, right? Yeah. That dorm used to be the all-boy's dorm back when my dad used to work here. Robert Hyde's old room. How do you know? Janitors are the eyes and ears of the entire school. We know everything. So, then, this must be his ring. Look. R-y-h. So, if you could help me find his address, then I could mail it to him or something. I mean, it's got to be in a file around here somewhere. I don't think you're gonna find anything. Robert Hyde disappeared from campus 30 years ago. 30 years ago this month, to be exact. No one's seen him since. What do you mean he disappeared? What happened to him? Nobody knows. Seeing that there was no body. My dad told me that a few of the old delta boys, they were questioned. But nothing ever came of it. No surprise, seeing what kind of money they were all from. So, they thought that he was murdered? That's how the rumor goes. I mean, how else would he have just disappeared? They say that his books were found open. The way he'd just been studying. But why would anyone wanna hurt him? I don't know. Apparently, he wasn't that popular. Not that that's a reason. But, uh, he was smart. Real smart. Number one in his class, full scholarship. So, I guess you might as well just keep the ring then. I don't know if I want it. Well, then just get rid of it. I wish I could. Sorry. I... I heard someone, so I came to check it out. Are... are you okay? Yeah. What are you doing here? Well, I saw someone in the window, and I thought I was the only one on campus, so I came down to see who it was. Yeah. I just woke up to get a glass of water. I'm... I'm sorry. I hope I didn't scare you. Oh, that's alright. I thought that I was the only one on campus for Christmas. Yeah, well, um, my flight back home is pretty expensive, you know. My dad's been laid off for a while now, so they couldn't afford it. Don't tell anyone, alright? It just... it just wouldn't do to have a member of delta too broke to go home. Especially since the only reason they accepted me was because of my father. Your father was a member? He'd have to be. It's fraternity tradition. See? Each of the leading five members of the fraternity have been future generations of the original five who founded halston college over a hundred years ago. I mean, between you and I, it's... I don't know what's so great about it. But I didn't wanna disappoint my dad, so I joined. I would love to be in a sorority. Every one who's not in one says that. But trust me, it's not everything. There's a lot more important things than being part of a frat. Are you cold? H-here, let me get you something. Sorry, I just... I turned the heat down for the night. So, what about you? Why aren't you off for Christmas? My parents are in Florida. Really? That sounds a lot more exciting than here. Why don't you go with them? I wasn't invited. Well, I'm sure glad you're here. That way, neither of us is alone for Christmas. I'm sorry. It's late. I better go. [Thunder] It's Christmas. Do you always spend the holidays at school? Well, not usually. I used to go home to spend it with my son. But he's been traveling in Europe this past year, and decided to spend Christmas there. If you ask me, it's because he's met a girl. Hmm. Now, that's a bit of Christmas cheer. You said you started working here in 1975, right? Uh-hmm. Did you know a student by the name of Robert Hyde? Hmm. I knew Robert quite well, actually. He used to come to see me to talk. He was a wonderful boy. Very sweet, very smart. I heard he wasn't very popular. No. No, he wasn't. The other students were very cruel to him. Hey, Robert! Come here for a sec, buddy. What do you want? Well, nothing. I just wanted to say hi, see how you're doing. Is that cool? There's something... There's something... There's something different about you, man. Did you get a, a hair... Yeah, uh, he got a haircut. You got a haircut, didn't you? Yeah. You know, I like it, man. It kinda looks, uh, it looks sexy. It's awesome. It does look sexy. Girls, watch out. Alright, man. Just take it easy. We'll see you later. Check you later, Robbie. I tried to help him through counseling. I even spoke to the administration about it. They said it was just part of campus life, and he needed to learn how to stand up for himself. Hmm. But after he disappeared, everyone conveniently forgot what he went through. I know what he went through. What are you gonna do with these, huh? Hey, give those back to me. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Pass it here. Do you want it, man? Here, I'll give it to you. Come on. Ooh. Sorry about that. I'm sorry, man. Oh, poor Robert. Oh. Do you think a student did it? I don't know. I didn't know what to think. Hey, guys. I hope I'm not interrupting. Oh, Doug, no. Of course not. I'm glad you decided to come. Hey, Becky. You two know each other. Well, great. Now I don't have to bother with introductions. We can just relax and have a good time. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [Thunder] Whoa, careful there. You got a little too much Christmas cheer. Here, uh, why don't you sit down for a minute? So, how'd you and Mrs. Gordon get to be such good friends? She helped me work through, uh, a few things when I got here. What kind of things? Actually, I'd rather not say. Sorry. I didn't mean to be nosy. No, it's okay. It's silly, really. I... I don't know why I keep it a secret. Yeah. Well, it's no secret that I go see the geek counselor. It's just one more thing for you popular guys to make fun of me about. I'm sorry. Well, I didn't really mean you. You're different from them. You're sweet. [Male voice chanting words in foreign language] Are you okay? Can you hear that? Hear what? Are you alright? I think I'm gonna be sick. [Male voice chanting words in foreign language] Stop. Stop. Stop. Can't believe the party's, like, a week away, and there's still so much to do. I know. And Megan was supposed to be organizing everything, and she's not even coming back. So, what are we gonna do? We can't let our brother fraternity down. Hey, Becky. We're having a bit of a girls' night here. Why don't you come join us? Um, okay. Sure. We're just trying to organize the big delta party. Every year it's been our sorority's responsibility. This year, we're screwed because Megan's not here, and we're short of hand. She's still not over Sean. We thought maybe you could help us out. Um, you guys are forgetting something. She's not an official sorority member. Oh, yeah. So, we'll make her one. You want me to be a member? Sure, why not? I mean, you are over your ugly duckling phase. Thank god. So, what do you say? Are you in? Yeah. Yeah, I'm in. So, how many is that? Okay. Well, we have 54 people on the guest list. So, how many hors d'oeuvres each? How about three? That's not enough. Do you know how much those football players eat? Oh, I don't know, alright? Look, I'm just tired of this. Let's take a break. Hey, guys. Look what I found in my parents' basement. Oh, my god! I haven't played this since I was, like, 12. Uhm, what is it? It's a special board. And you use it to call upon spirits and stuff. Not for real. What? Don't you believe in ghosts? Well, I've never seen one before, so I don't know. Hey, guys. I bet you the school's got some ghosts. What do you think? Should we try it? If there are any spirits here who wish to speak to us, please tell us that you're here. Okay, this is boring. We're not concentrating, that's all. Here. Close your eyes and focus. [Thunder] If there's anyone here, please give us a sign of your presence. If there's anyone here, please give us a sign of your presence. If there's anyone here, please give us a sign of your presence. [Wind blowing] Huh! If there's anyone here, please give us a sign of your presence. Is there someone here? Are you a good spirit? Are you a bad spirit? Um, maybe we shouldn't play anymore. Shh! Can you tell us who you are? It's only Matt and those guys being jerks. Ooh, Matt's here? What do they want? I don't know. But it looks like they've got a bottle of something. Whoo! Whoo! Hey! Hey, feeling better? Uh, yeah. Sorry about Christmas Eve. I think I was a little drunk. No, it's okay. We've all been there before. Well, I still had a really good Christmas. Yeah, yeah. Same here. So, krista tells me you're one of the sorority girls now. Yeah. I can't believe it. So, I guess you're gonna be at the big party then. I guess so. So, you have a date yet or... Hey, how come you're not dancing? Unbelievable. Hey, is that an old halston ring? My dad's got one just like that. Let me see that. Ahh! What the hell was that? I've gotta go. What happened? Huh! Oh, my god. Hey, is that an old halston ring? My dad's got one just like it. Geez! What happened's not acceptable. Look... [Speaking indistinctly] [Man moaning] [Door opening] Where's Doug? He needs to be here for this. Hey, Doug! Hey, man, what is it? Doug, meet the next members of the fraternity. You guys can't be serious. I told you, power of five. You can't just go and pick up whoever you want, man. Shut up and give me the bottle. To the brotherhood of five. And we serve, honor and protect one another, for together we are invincible. [In Latin] Drink. Welcome to delta, boys. And now, the initiation. Guys. On your knees. Are you ready? Come on. That's good, huh? Alright, take it down. Take it down. Come on, you want some more? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, big boy, take it straight down. I didn't think you wanna swallow the whole bottle. Oh, yeah. It's time to have a shower now, delta boys. Oh-ho-ho. [Glass breaking] Hey, Becky. We divided the list up into four of all the things that need to be done for the party. Here is your list. It all has to be ready for Saturday. Remember, you're a sorority girl now. And with that comes responsibility and certain obligations. Which reminds me, we forgot to mention something. What? Well, in order to become an official member, first, you need to perform an initiation task. That's right. And after a discussion, we decided that you are to bring us back one genuine jockstrap, fresh from the boys' locker room. You think you can handle that? Good. We'll be waiting. Oh, my! Are you guys ready to party this weekend? Absolutely. Well, you better be. We always host the best party of the year. Right, guys? You got it. How about you? You're taking that Becky chick to the party? I was thinking about it until you were all over her the other night. Hey, man. We were just dancing. You could've cut in anytime. If you ask me, that chick's still a freak. There's something weird about that girl. Hey, man. Shut up, alright? She's a nice person. Whatever. Where's my jockstrap? [Male voice chanting in Latin] Craig? Craig, are you alright? What's wrong with him? [Male voice chanting in Latin] This is horrible. I mean, I didn't know that Craig was allergic to nuts. Me, neither. This has been the worst senior year ever. I mean, first Sean and then Derek and now Craig. [Siren wailing] You know what they say, "bad things happen in threes." Then it should be over, right? Oh, Becky. Hi. Did we have an appointment today? Becky, what's going on? What is it? I don't know what's happening to me. Oh, you're shaking. Here, uh, come sit down. Now, tell me. What's going on? Did someone hurt you? It's me. I'm hurting them. Becky, what are you talking about? I can't control it. It's like I become a different person. And then it happens. I mean, first Sean and then Derek. And I just... I... I don't know what to do. Becky. I want it to stop. I know it's horrible what happened to those boys, but it's not your fault. It is my fault. I killed them. This thing, this person that has been taking over my body, it wants to hurt people. Get rid of it. Uh, what you're telling me, it doesn't make any sense, alright? Just calm down and, um, think about this rationally. What you're saying, it can't be happening. It is. It's the ring. Ever since I found it, he won't leave me alone. He? Who's he? Robert. Robert Hyde. He's here. He's inside of me, and he's making me hurt people. Why would Robert wanna hurt anyone? I don't know. But I need to find out before he hurts anyone else. Please, I need help, Jane. Do you believe me? I don't know, Becky. I don't know. Oh, my god. What did they do to you, Robert? What did they do? Oh, my god. Look at my bloat. Never should've had that cracker. I told you, carbs. Hmm. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. [Screams] Is this somebody's idea of a joke? Because it's not funny. Oh, good. You found it. Student missing at halston. Fraternity members questioned. Five members of the long-standing delta phi psi fraternity of halston college were questioned in connection with the disappearance of student Robert York Hyde. Brad kelley, Tom Bradford, Chris Johnson, Kevin Grant and Steven hart were detained by police for questioning. They were later released. No charges have been laid. That's it. Their fathers. Their fathers did it, and now he's taking revenge out on their sons. Hey, Becky. What are you doing? Nothing. Just some med research. God, I hate research. Me, too. How are you doing? What? You mean, how am I dealing with the fact that three of my friends have died in the last month? I'm sorry. Didn't mean to bring it up. No, it's alright. To be honest, I think I'm getting a little numb to it all. God, that's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? No, it's not. It's just your way of dealing with things. I guess. Uh, listen, there's, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. Um, but lately, there hasn't seem like... Like a really good time. Like right now, so I'm just gonna go for it. I was wondering if you want to be my date for the party tonight. Oh, great. You probably think this is some kind of nasty joke or something. No, I believe you. And I'd love to be your date, really. But... You're just not interested. God, I feel like an idiot. That's not it. Trust me. I wanna go. It's just that... What? Listen, if you're worried about all those other guys, screw them, alright? You'll be with me. I'm sorry. I just... I can't. Alright. Um, well, I... I just... I just, I just thought I'd ask. It was... it was stupid, I guess. I'm sorry. Don't worry about that. Hey, my dad's name is in here. Steven. Steven hart. What's this about? Your friends... Sean, Derek, Craig... I don't think that their deaths were accidents. Of course they were. I was there. I saw it. So was I. What are you talking about? Your dad, Sean's dad, all your dads were somehow involved in the disappearance of a student here 30 years ago. My dad? No, no. He would have told me. Listen, I know that this is really hard to believe. But this student, this Robert, is somehow using me to get revenge on something that happened to him 30 years ago. Something that your father and all the old delta boys did. He's taking it out on the next generation. Sean, Derek, Craig, probably you and Matt. I can't go to the party, Doug, 'cause I'm afraid that I might hurt you. This is stupid. Okay? Listen, if you don't wanna go with me, just say so, okay? You don't have to make up some crazy-ass story. If you don't believe me, touch it. So, what? I don't understand. I mean, Matt, he touched it and it burned him. That's what led me to believe that... Maybe, Craig was right, okay? Maybe there is something wrong with you. Becky, Doug hart was in here today to see me. He told me you were telling him some disturbing stories about his father and about this whole idea you have about... About Robert. Becky, if you need help, I will try and help you, but spreading stories to the other students... But it's true. Look. Those are the ones who did it. Becky, these boys were questioned 30 years ago. I was here. The police let them go because they had nothing to do with it. Then why are their sons dying? I checked it out, all of them. Sean, Derek, Craig, all of the leaders of the fraternity are the sons of those men. Is it that hard to believe? Of all people, you know what those guys did to Robert. You told me. I mean, what if something happened? What if something went wrong? Some trick or prank? And now, their sons are paying the price through me. Robert Hyde is having his revenge. If you want proof, look at Matt's hand. Robert Hyde's ring burned him when he tried to touch it. I'm telling you the truth. This is happening. It's real. Come on. Poor Robert Hyde. Come on, buddy. You didn't think we were serious, did you? Come on. Just like... Just like you didn't think we were serious about, you know, having you in our fraternity. Robbie. Buddy, we called you down here for a good old-fashioned geek bashing. Ooh! [Glass breaking] Aw! Come on, Robert. Get him! Come on, Robbie. Where are you going? Robbie. You little sissy. Where are you going? Whoa! Grab him. Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert. Robert. Hey. Don't touch him. Robert. Guys, guys, I think he's dead. What are we gonna do now? Robert. Just take it easy. Alright, alright. Come on. Come on. Hey, come on, man. You guys, hurry up. Let's go. Don't rush us, man. Go, go. Come on, man. Come on. Dude, let me... Will you shut up. Dude, I'm serious. No one's telling anyone. [Robert screaming] Oh, no, he's not dead! You saw it, didn't you? Yeah, it's true. They did it. My father was the one that found Robert's glasses down here. With Brad's fingerprints all over them. That's why the police brought them in for questioning. It was an accident. They thought that he was already dead. If they have just gone for help, then none of this would've happened. Robert would still be here. But they didn't. And I guess you are the one chosen to find the truth. Problem is that's not the only thing I was chosen for. [Party music playing] I can't believe this. Becky totally bailed on us. You know, I knew we should never have trusted her. Hey, ladies, where's the food? It's coming. I hope it gets here soon. I am starving. I'm going to kill her. Yeah. Oh, my god. Guys. Hey, girls. Oh, we're so glad to see you. You have no idea. How are you feeling? Let's put it this way. Totally hot, third-year law, and lives two blocks away from my parents' house. Oh, my god. You are so lucky. What about Sean? Sean will always have a special place in my heart, but I'm over it. This is so great. What's going on here? Well, you were gone, right? And we needed some help, so I just... Krista decided to let Becky into the sorority. Becky? We couldn't do it on our own, so we just asked her to help out. As you can see, she was totally useless. Well, of course. What were you thinking? I don't know. I just... I'll take care of it. Regional police. Yes. I need to speak to someone about a murder. A murder? Where? Where are you calling from? Halston college. You need to send someone... Hello? Hello? [Dial tone] Ugh! [Party music playing] Whoo! Shake it, baby. Oh, my god. Come on, baby. You are so hot. Whoo! Yeah, man. Take it off, baby. Yeah. Whoo! Come on, Matt. That is too hot for words. That's it. I'm so going for it tonight. Whoo-hoo! [Banging sounds] Hello? Hello, is anyone there? [Banging sounds] Hey, Mrs. Gordon. Oh, Doug. What are you doing here with that? Uh, sorry. I... I just thought I'd take advantage of the space. You know, everyone's out, so... I hope I didn't bother you. No, no, no. It's fine. Doug, what are you doing here anyway? Aren't you supposed to be hosting your big party tonight? Yeah. I just, uh, I wasn't really into it. You wanna tell me about it? Not really. Um, I guess it's just this whole Becky thing. I think I was pretty harsh. You don't believe her? Well, no. Why? Do you? I don't know. Well, it's... it's just that... Well, after Robert disappeared, things happened too fast. Like people rushed in to cover things up. And the boys who were questioned were from affluent, influential families - families that could make things go away. What? So you're saying you think my dad killed him? I wasn't saying that. I don't know what happened. It's just that it's all starting to seem like too much of a coincidence. You know, my mother once said that there's no such thing as a coincidence. Everything happens for a reason. Hmm. Your mother sounds like a smart woman. Hey, Mrs. Gordon. Uh, thanks for all the help you've given me and for not telling anyone I'm adopted. It just makes some people weird around you, you know? Like... like you don't quite belong. That's it. What? You said Becky asked you to touch the ring. So what? Nothing happened. Yes. Well, of course. If what Becky is saying is true, you are not part of the five natural sons. It's... it's like you said. You don't belong. So, what? You're saying you believe her. I don't know. But what if your mother is right? Nothing is coincidence. [Party music playing] Whoo! Yeah! Oh, my god. Look who decided to show her face. I need to talk to you. What? You need to leave. Something bad is going to happen. To me? What are you talking about? Please, just come with me. Yeah! Who does that girl think she is? Wait, I'll handle this. Okay. Whoo! Aw! Yeah! Go, go, go, go, go! Hi, Becky. Megan. You're back. That's right. Surprised to see me? Well, the other girls said that you weren't coming back. Well, I'm here. So, I guess all your little fun is over. Excuse me? I see how you've managed to weasel your way around while I was gone. Do you actually think you're sorority material? Because I'll tell you, underneath all the new makeup, the hair, even the clothes, you're still the same person. The same old Becky. The Becky we loved to hate and make fun of everyday of your pathetic life. I mean, what were you thinking? You think that krista and the girls really like you? Well, they don't. They were just using you. And now that I'm back, they don't need you anymore. So you can go back to being who you really are. Becky, campus loser. [Megan laughing] You know what, Megan? I'm sick and tired of your crap. Excuse me? That's right. And if I were you... [Speaking in a male's voice] I would back off, bitch. You know, seeing as we're getting to know each other here, I thought I should tell you. Just before I killed him, your sweetheart, Sean, he wanted to screw me. God, I hope Megan gave it to her. I don't believe this. What a tramp. She has some nerve. Alright. Oh, she did not. Do you see her? Maybe she didn't come. Well, let's have a look around, just in case. Becky, you're... What a surprise. I'm full of surprises. Alright, kinky. You like that? Yeah, baby. Good. [In a male's voice] Then let's get it on. Did you guys see that? How couldn't you? She was making a total spectacle of herself. So not sorority material. You know what? That's it. I waited all last semester to get with Matt, and I am not gonna watch it get spoiled by some white bitch with a good makeover. Uh! Did you find her? No. No. She must not be here. So, this is your idea of fun, huh? Not really. [Girl screaming] What's going on? Huh! Oh! Becky. Becky, can you hear me? Listen to me. Where did it happen? Where did they kill Robert? The incinerator. Let's go. Doug. What are we doing? I don't know. But maybe if we can find some clue, something that will prove the murders, we can put all these to rest. Becky, do you know what he wants? How do we stop this? I don't know. Just follow me. This way. Robert, stop! It's me, Robert, Janine, remember? We used to talk. We know what happened, Robert. We know what they did to you. We wanna help you. [Robert's voice] It's too late. Becky, wait, please. I don't belong. I'm not my father's natural son. I'm adopted. I'm not a part of them. He's right, Robert. He's not a part of this. That's why it didn't burn me. The ring. It's the truth, Becky. Robert, tell us. How can we help you? What is it that you want? [Voice of Robert] Peace. Becky? Doug? What happened? It's okay. It's all over. Hey. Hey. You ready? Yeah, I just gotta pick up some stuff from Joe. Okay. Hey, guys. What are you up to? Yeah. There's this killer bash at the rhino's tonight. I hear everybody's gonna be there. Thanks, but, uh, we got other things to do. They're so perfect together. I know. Don't you just hate them? Hmm. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.
