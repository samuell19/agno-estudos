Where are y'all headed? Well, we're trying to get up to Santa Susana Pass Road but however far you can take us. - Oh, Spahn Ranch? - Hey, yeah. How did you know? Yeah, well, not quite, uh, all the way up there. My, uh, my aunt lives nearby. What you got there? Some money, I guess. Hey, if you're gonna take us all the way we should buy you breakfast. Right on. I don't know. I thought "Tiptoe Through The Tulips" was a pretty far-out song if you're a little high. I guess I was a lot high when I first heard it. Seems like a fag to me. Hey, watch it. Tex here told the army he was an acid head homosexual to get out of the war, so.. I'm not actually a homosexual. I mean, who sings like that? Guy with his voice all high like a girl and his tiny little whatchamacallit. It's a put on. Everything's a put on. Tiny Tim is just having fun. Hey, we better get out of here. Uh, sing that one. ♪ Ride take a free ride ♪ Take my place ♪ Have my seat ♪ It's for free ♪ Ride my see-saw ♪ Ride ♪ Ride ♪ Ride my see-saw ♪ Damn. Okay. Goodnight, Katie. Goodnight, Lulu. Goodnight, Sadie. Goodnight. "Lying in your prison bed "womb straining, sweat pouring "you deliver your child within these concrete walls "and steel bars.

I thought it was really powerful, Tina. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. Pardon me, ladies. Karlene, can I speak with you? - Sure. - Ooh. You guys, go ahead. I need your help with the Manson girls over in the Special Security Unit. Since the death penalty was lifted no one knows what to do with them. The Governor doesn't want them in general population so they are on death row indefinitely. Just the three of them, stuck in those cells 23 hours a day. I can't let them rot in there. Good morning, ladies. - Hi, Miss Carlson. - Hello, Miss Carlson. I'd like you to meet Karlene Faith. - Hi, Karlene. - Nice to meet you, Karlene. Nice to meet you all. Karlene is a graduate student at UC, Santa Cruz and she teaches some of the inmates here. Now that you're gonna be staying with us I think it's a good time to talk about taking some classes with her. So that... that means we are staying in the SSU for good then? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We're offering college courses to residents here. You'd be free to study just about anything you want. Literature, Philosophy, Journalism. Are we gonna learn about shit like Women's Lib? Language, please, Susan. We don't have to study Women's Lib, no although I do teach a Women's Studies course here in CIW. Women's Studies. Far out. I'll leave you ladies to it. - Thank you, Miss Carlson. - Bye, Miss Carlson. - Bye, Miss Carlson. - Oh, thank you, Jimmy. - Thanks, Jimmy. - Thank you, Jimmy. Hey, Karlene, do you want some grape Tang? Pretty please, Jimmy, can we have some grape Tang for our guest? Thanks, Jimmy. Jimmy always takes care of us. And you should hear him sing. ♪ I'll never smile Our favorite guard should have been a famous crooner! ♪ Until I smile at you ♪ Ooh! Thank you. You're Susan, right? I'm Sadie. Susan's dead. Charlie named me Sadie. - Where are you from? - I'm from the now. I'm from everywhere. Hello. I'm Lulu. On the list they gave you, I'm sure it says Leslie but I'm Lulu. And I'm Katie. I think I would be interested in studying the women of the pioneer. That's what we were doing with Charlie. Learning how to live off the land and be self-sufficient. Earth mothers. ♪ The only way you're happy ♪ Is not where you're not free ♪ ♪ Your home is where you can be what you are ♪ ♪ 'Cause you are born free ♪ Now they'll show you the castle ♪ Hey, Gypsy. - Who's this? - I'm Leslie.

So we are just being today. ♪ Now they'll show you their castle ♪ ♪ And I want a little smoke smoke smoke smoke now ♪ ♪ Mmm mmm ♪ Well, Jesus, I guess I'm your best friend. Play something for me, Little Paulie. I got a blank, Charlie! Well, well, well, well, well. Looky, looky here. Well, hey there, Brother Bobby? What do we have here? Gypsy said Leslie would be happy with you. Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, my baby Gypsy. You brought someone just like I asked. Now that's a good soldier. Be my mirror. My name's Charlie. Where did you find her? She was hanging around my harem for a while. But it was turning into a bad scene with my old lady. Beautiful Brother Bobby. He really knows how to make love to the girls. That's what they all tell me. Sadie's made love to Bobby, right? Yeah, we've all made love to him at this point, huh? I can't take another man's woman. She's not mine, Charlie. Gypsy told me all about you and the family. - I can't take her. - Charlie. I think we should let her stay. She digs us and she's hungry. She's a seeker. Where are your parents? It doesn't matter to me. I'm on my own journey. Well, what do you have for us? Do you have a car? - No. - Well, then we'll get you one. We'll get you a car. We'll find you a car. You know why? Because old ego is a too much thing. Old ego is a too much thing. He'll make you fool yourself. You'll think you're somebody else. You'll ride that whole subway train. You like her, you teach her. You keep an eye on her, and you see if she belongs with us. And, you, Katie is my everything. Katie is me. You pay attention to what she does. If you're even half as good as her, then you can stay. When I first met Charlie, I just knew. Hopped on a bus and I never looked back. But Charlie's like a... beacon of light or something. I mean, look at you, you're here. - Hey, Tex. - Hello there. How you doing? Tex hasn't reached awareness yet. He's still working on letting go of his ego. Charlie says, "Let go of your ego and be like a finger on a hand." Come on. I want you to meet George. George Spahn. It's his ranch. Hello? Squeaky is so kind to him. - She's a generous soul. - I'll say. It's beautiful here. We don't get hung up about sex. You get it? We just be. We let things happen. We let go. I think you're gonna love it. Hurry up now, everybody. Come on. - Dennis. - Hey, girl. And who is this pretty thing? - I'm Leslie. - Ah, welcome. I'm not in this family, but.. ...I dig this family. Hi. Beach Boys Dennis? That's really Dennis Wilson? - He's just Dennis to us. - Time for communion. You've turned on before, right? Millions of times. Just, uh, wasn't expecting it right now. I spent my life in jail for you. So that you could ride your bicycles. Have your birthday parties. I never had a life. I don't even know what life is. But you all had a life. Your parents told you what to do and you did it. And for payment, you got what? You got little cookie cutter minds. Look what happened to Sandy. Spoiled Sandy. Spoiled Sandy had to come to her new daddy to find something real. Take off your clothes for us, Sandy. Do it. Help her. Come on. Can't you see she needs help? Tex. Get up here. Go on. Now you look at how parents abuse their children. If they loved her why did they allow doctors to cut up her body like this? And then they felt bad and then they spoiled her. And now Sandy can't let go of her ego. It's not your fault, it's your parents' fault. Would you say that to me? It's my parents' fault. And it's not your fault. It's not my fault. Now turn around. It's not your fault. It's not my fault. It's your parents' fault. It's my parents' fault. Now come and tell her that she looks beautiful. - You look beautiful, Sandy. - You look beautiful. - You're beautiful. - Perfect. You look beautiful. We love you so much. You look so beautiful. You are beautiful, Sandy. So he led Katie away and I asked Squeaky if Katie was Charlie's old lady. And Squeaky told me "Nobody belongs to anybody here "except Charlie. We all belong to Charlie." I thought that was pretty far out. Then she says, "If you're lucky, he'll pick you next." Every girl should have a daddy like Charlie. Something for you to take a look at for next week. The Bible is the only book Charlie let us have around. Charlie says that authors are evil. Trying to play mind tricks on the reader. So do you feel like you'd be doing something bad by studying with me? Because if you are going to do these classes with me you're going to have to read books. I'm also gonna leave a copy of this. Have any of you read it? This book changed my life. It looks like it could be interesting. Can you believe Charles Manson wouldn't let them read? It's been three years since they had any contact with him. But all they do is talk about him and spout his bullshit. I want you to come talk to them. You should do your poetry workshop. No way. There are real victims in this prison. They're the ones I wanna help. Maybe these women are victims too. Would you be saying that if it was your sister? Your pregnant sister who got stabbed 20 times. It's Leslie's shower time so it's your time in the yard, Pat. And, Susan, I guess it's just gonna be you and me for a bit. Perfect opportunity for a hand job. Just teasing, Jimmy.

Look, there's a reason I asked you to give up your watches and your clocks and your calendars. I know that was difficult, but where did it get us? - You, do you feel more free? - Yes, Charlie. And why is that, Katie? - I'm living in the now. - Mm-hmm. I don't need a soulless gadget to tell me how to live. I don't wanna be like the plastic people. Exactly. That's what our parents and our schools taught us. You live by these numbers. You play by these rules. That time is over. I'm here to make the new rules and the new rules are no rules. Oh, yeah. I think it's time for us to give you a name. Now what is it those, uh, those people named you the ones you occupied a house with and called a family? - Les... - No, I don't wanna know. You're gonna be Lulu. Welcome, Lulu. Welcome. Yeah, what do we think of that, guys? Lulu. - Yeah! There we go. - Lulu. - Lulu. - Hi, Lulu. - Lulu. - That's far out! - Hi, little Lulu. - Hi, Lulu. See, what we're trying to do here is we're trying to break down inhibitions. We're trying to live in our bodies every night. Touch each other. Touch yourselves. See? It's not a foreign country. Your body's like a plant. If you don't give it love, then... it will die. A little birdie told me Tex here doesn't know how to give head. To me, man, that's... that's a crime. - Come on, Charlie. - Now don't get uptight, man. I want my family to know each other in every way. We got no secrets. We got no shame. It's not your fault that no one taught you. - You heard of Freud? - Yeah. Well, looky here, man. The dude was always talking about oral fixations. I mean, we all got 'em. Cat was right. You need to suck on something. That's why you got a mouth. That's why women got titties. You see kids? They're always sucking on their thumbs or their fingers or they're chewing on suckers or jawbreakers. And people are always sticking pickles or smokes and zuzus in their face, you dig? Point is, Tex, if you're gonna suck on something then you better be fucking good at it, man. Gypsy, you get your fine ass up here now. Come on now. Don't get uptight, man. Come on. We got no secrets. We got no shame. Now look. Oh, alright. I see you. You see this guy? This is the guy who needs attention. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. But you gotta be slow, like you care. Come on now. Give it to her, Tex. It's okay. Don't get uptight about Sandy, man. She's having an ego death. What we're trying to do here, man, is submit. Let go. Get rid of materialistic culture of hang-ups. You dig? We're all about love here. Except sometimes, there has to be some death itself. Changes, tears. Weird trips. That's how it is. That's how it's always been. Oh, that's cool. You're not into it. That's okay. You don't have to do anything you don't wanna do here. It's not, that's not what we're about. Let's just go back. No. I... I want to... stay here with you right now. What is it you don't like about your body? Come on now, you hate something. All women do. What is it, tits too small? Huh? Ass too big? What is it for Lulu? No, don't you hide for me. Tell me what it is that you hate. My thighs, I guess. - Too fat. - No. You are perfect. You say it to me. You say I am perfect. I am perfect. I am perfect. I am perfect. I am perfect. I am perfect. Hey, little girl. Now listen to me. If you wanna be free of all the bad experiences and inhibitions that are crushing you you have to imagine that you are making love to your daddy, okay? That's what all the girls want and can never have. Ladies, we have our own special cell for school now. I'm not sure what you all did to make Miss Carlson like you so much, but she gave the okay. Thanks, Jimmy. It's been a long time. Ah, I'm sorry, ladies. I'm gonna have to break that up. - It's not really allowed to.. - Okay. Ta-da. - Lovely. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about this one. - Did you all read it? - It was horrible. It was very depressing. I felt really bad for the women in those situations. A lot of women right here in this prison are survivors of domestic violence. They defended themselves and this is where it landed them. That is so sad. That makes me really sad. Are you friends with them? Do you help them? Yes, and yes. I'm working with a woman now who's trying not to let her daughter be put into foster care. She killed her abusive husband she went to prison, and now her kid has no parents. - What's her name? - How long is she in for? How old is her kid? I'm not really allowed to give details like that. Well, what about you? Do you have kids? Yes. I have four kids. And what does your husband do? As much as I'd love to talk about me I am here to teach you and I am not a subject that merits a college class. I feel so lucky. We'll have to decorate. Make things for it. - It's like being home again. - Yeah. The family BC. - BC? - Before the crimes. When everything was about love. Yeah. Like when Mary gave birth to Pooh Bear. And we all witnessed the miracle. - You can do it. - Yeah. You got this, mama. - One, two, three, push! - One, two, three, push! - Charlie's here. - It's alright, baby. It's alright. It's alright. Nice and easy. Paul, why don't you play some music? We want this motherfucker to come out dancing, right? You just push, honey. You take it easy. Go with the motion. Go with the motion, Mary.

Just go with the motion, darling. You're gonna go with the motion. Alright. Great, I'm gonna make a little cut now. - Charlie! - One, two, three. Oh, no, you're gonna give it to me right now. Give it to me now. Oh, there we go. There we go. That's it, come on, one more, one more time! One more time! One more time! One more time now. Come on, darling! Here we go, here we go! Come on!

And that there will be babies that are homeless and they need saving from all the killings. And then we'll stay underground and make music and make love until the violence is over. And then... and then when it comes time for us to rise to the surface again, some of us will begin to feel budding wings on our backs. - Wings? - Yes. Some of us want to become winged elves. Me and Sandy, Squeaky. Charlie says it would happen. Karlene thinks we're crazy. No. I would never use that word. I'm just surprised to hear some of this stuff. You've to admit it's pretty far out. You must know that elves are mythical creatures and therefore human beings can't turn into elves or sprout wings? Well, hey, man, it's no more far out than heaven and hell. - Yeah. Charlie says that... - Yeah, but what do you think? Pat, do you still think it's possible that you will become a winged elf? Well, I guess not now. Not... not when we're in here. You won't become a winged elf whether you're in here or out in the world. Karlene, tell us about your kids. Pretty please? What are their names? How old are they? We spend too much time talking about us in here. They are 15, 14, 11 and 7. You have a 7-year-old? He must miss you so much. - I see him every weekend. - I didn't mean it like that. I took my family all around the world. To Germany, to France, to Ethiopia. We've been through a lot together and they are always surprising me. Mom, I have a new family now. Leslie, what are you talking about? We're your parents. Mom, please stop crying. Listen to me. I need you to stop loving me.

Right at that moment, I was probably sitting in my secretarial school freaking out but not even knowing it. We don't talk about our pasts. We don't have pasts. Our lives started when we met Charlie.

Thanks. Now, Katie, get everyone together. Tell them just stop what they're doing right now and come here. - Okay. - Soon. Now. Terry Melcher is coming to hear me play. So we need to be ready. I mean, we need to be more than ready. Terry Melcher. Terry Melcher! Come on. Dennis' producer, the guy who can give me a record deal, goddamn it. Yeah. When Terry hears me play, he's gonna lose his mind which means the world gets to hear my music. And then all the lost young loves during the mayhem and the killing will hear my music and they will know that they have a home. So, guys, make this place look spotless. Get rid of all the stuff that stinks. And, girls, you bake some cookies. Go to the grocery store. I don't want no garbage run food for Terry. And I want a deer skin shirt and pants held together by laces. I want him to see my commitment to going back to the land. But don't they have to kill the deer for that? Lulu has a question. Would you like to repeat that, Lulu? Don't they kill the deer... What we have here.. ...what we have here is a contradiction.

Getting hit by the man you love is no different than making love to him. Charlie just gives me what I need. I brought you gifts. I love the way new books smell. Thank you so much. We have a Christmas present for you. Did you bring it, Katie? Sadie did this. The sun. And that's a butterfly. Lulu did it. It's just like the one we made for Charlie. Ready, baby girl? I got this. You see that? She trusts me. She's not afraid. You'd die for me, wouldn't you, girl? Of course, Charlie. You, uh, got a knife for me? ♪ You're gonna wake up one morning ♪ ♪ As the sun meets the dawn Girls, these Straight Satan Gods I think we need them. Tex tells me he got into a little complication with a black man. It might come back on us. So I want you to make them feel welcome. Give them your gift. Show them a good time. Charlie doesn't like us to do speed. Charlie can't see us right now. ♪ When you never need me ♪ You're gonna wake up wondering ♪ ♪ Why'd you sleep all alone ♪ No one's gonna stop you baby ♪ ♪ I'm not coming home I'm not coming home ♪♪ - Where you headed? - Anywhere but here. This album is a musical roadmap to our future. Now when he talks about the piggies he's talking about the rich and the powerful needin' a damn good whacking. The "Blackbird." It's the black man's time to rise. And "Revolution 1," it's a call to arms. It's time. "Revolution 9," it's the soundtrack to the war. It's guns. Screaming. Does that make you feel afraid? No. It's like you always said it would be. You're damn straight it's like I always said it would be. You should feel proud. You should all feel proud. And why should you all feel proud? Lulu, why? Because we're already living like revolutionaries. Yes! Now dig this. In Revelations, in the Bible it talks about the locusts coming to Earth. Now that's the Beatles. And he talks about the locusts having scales like iron breastplates. That's the Beatles' guitars. And dig this. He talks about five angels coming to Earth. Now this five angels, four of them are the Beatles the other one is me. And the other one is me because I am given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. And where is the bottomless pit? The one you told us about in Death Valley? - The one we're going to find. - Yes! So "Helter Skelter" is the thing, man. It's what the black man's gonna do to start the race war. But just like the Bible says I will lead my family to the bottomless pit and we will live out the war underground and we will expand to 144,000 and then we will come back like the 12 tribes of Israel. And when we come back, the black man will not know how to act or how to be or how to govern or what to do. And so, we cannot leave! We cannot leave because you're white people and you will be murdered. You will be made into black slaves. And Tex, Tex! Tex is gonna be sorry that he ever left our tribe. - Thanks for coming out here. - That's okay. Hey, look, my wife just wants to know all about these crazy Manson girls. Yeah. I get asked about them a lot too. Yeah. Um, okay, now you were all just kids when the Watts Riots happened, but it's a perfect example. Here you have black Americans oppressed for generations, at the end of their rope. You know, things got out of hand back then but the message was sent. Yeah, Charlie said that Watts was the beginning. I really think that a race war would have started if they hadn't put us in here. The black man is rising up and his time is coming. Do you think it's still coming? Um.. Well, Bobby Seale was bound and gagged in a courtroom but last year they let him go, so.. We don't know who that is. Black Panthers? Y'all don't get any news in here at all? Oh, yes. We know the Black Panthers. Charlie said that black people wouldn't be able to lead themselves after the revolution that they would need his help. Yeah, I heard that he said that. It's okay, he said you wouldn't understand now but that you would thank him later. But.. You don't think that's true? I find that to be a deeply racist idea. That black people would need a white man to tell them what to think. When black people take their power back there's no chance in hell that... Charlie said... Let's listen to what Bill has to say. There's no chance in hell that we would turn to a white person for leadership. And black people were brought here as slaves in 1619. And even after slavery and the eventual abolishment of slavery we are still getting crushed by racism. We don't trust the white men and we certainly don't need one to lead us. You hear me? The trouble with blackie is he wants to fuck all the white women turn all the white babies brown. We can't have that. That's what makes whitey mad. Well, we're gonna help blackie out. We're gonna start a race war called Helter Skelter. And we start this war by killing some white people and making it look like the black man's work. Blackie's been waiting for this. Blackie is waiting. And then the piggy cops will come down on blackie when they find the rich dead piggies. Then the revolution will begin. You understand me? Helter Skelter is upon us. Lulu, what's wrong? Did you ever start to think that maybe Helter Skelter isn't coming down at all? That Charlie was wrong? No. No. Don't let this place get to you. It would be happening right now if we weren't in here. Please don't give up now. - Okay. - Please, I need you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Lulu, this knife might be the only thing between you and blackie slitting your throat. Thrust and jab like you mean it. Thrust. Jab. Lift. Stab the chair. Good, Mary. I know everyone thinks we're these scary creatures who committed these horrible crimes but we were just engaging in the dance of life and death. Charlie says there is no death. So you're saying it's okay to take someone's life? Leslie, Susan, is that what you think? No. I'm saying that I'm starting to think that the devil took a hold of me so I could find my way to God. So Charlie is the devil? No, Charlie is Charlie and the devil is the devil. So you all still believe that thing he was talking about Helter Skelter? The other night, I started to doubt it and I got shaky. You felt doubt. What made you feel that doubt? That was just for a minute, right, Lulu? She doesn't doubt anymore. Sorry to interrupt your studies, ladies. I am afraid I have bad news. The decision has come down and you will remain here in SSU for the duration of your sentences. Fucking motherfuckers! They can't fucking do this shit to us! We're fucking human beings! You are considered an escape risk and too well known. No! I'm never gonna see Charlie again. We don't know what's gonna happen. There's always parole. You could get out. No, you. You could get out. They'll never let me out of here. It's my fault you're in here. Charlie said make sure everyone does something that night and I made sure you did. You must hate me. I could never hate you. Good afternoon, ladies. Special treat for you today. No school. Just a mini concert. Ladies, I brought Robin to play for you.. Ladies, why would you do this? Charlie spoke to us last night. He told us to. He told us to protest. Jesus fucking Christ. How the hell did they get razors? The guards love them. They have all kinds of things in their cells. Are you okay? It's just as long as they're stuck alone together in that unit just repeating their brainwashing back to each other.. I mean, they're never gonna see the real world again so what is it we can really do for them? I just wanna remind them if I can.. ...of who they were before they ever met Charles Manson. I just wanna give them back themselves. Let's go take a walk. Where's Charlie? He went somewhere with Paul. Seems like he's been gone forever. - You like living here? - Yeah. You should join us. - Nah, I need my freedom. - Freedom? That's all we have here. I like you. You should come away on adventures with me. I have a lot of responsibilities here. We're preparing for a war. Well, if we're all gonna die we better get to making love, huh? Well, I don't know about that. Come on. You might be my last chance, baby. Hey. Who the fuck are you? Sorry, man. I came.. I came with Danny and them guys. - I thought you... - Get the fuck out of here. And don't you come back unless you're invited which you wont be. Get up. Get out. You want me to help get your dick in your pants? Get the fuck out of my barn! You guys got a weird scene going on up here, man. You ask me first! You don't just whore around. That is it. No more hippie kids looking for a free ride and a quick lay. Nobody has any visitors unless it goes through me. We need to stay focused on our scene. No more outsiders. I'm gonna go on an adventure. You can come. Bring Lulu. Bring that Linda girl. We'll use her car. We get in the rich people's houses and we get in their heads, you dig? You just, you get in and get out. Don't be afraid. Mess things up a bit, but don't break anything. Alright, take a wallet here and there but mostly just let them know that they're not safe. But what if they wake up? Don't allow them to. Use your training, man. Be invisible. He'll wake up and say, "Honey, where did I put my wallet?" And he'll say, "Why did you put the portraits upside down?" What's in the wallet? Uh, uh, sixty bucks and three credit cards. Well, that's nothing. Next time we tie some piggies up and we scare them to death. Lulu, I think you should leave here. I came to help you do that. It looks like you're being made to stay here against your will. I can take you right now. You can drop that broom, get on my bike and we'll be gone. Nobody will stop us. No. I'm staying here. I want to be here. I-I mean.. Thank... thank you. Are you sure about this? I ain't expecting nothing from you. I mean, we... we ain't gotta ball just 'cause I get you out of here. You just look like you need rescuing, that's all. I'm sure. Let's go. You wanna leave me? Jump. That's my Lulu. I knew you weren't going anywhere. Hi. How are you? I've realized if I succeed in making them really accept what they did.. ...then they will have to live with that horror. Isn't that what prison's for? Atonement? Taking responsibility for one's actions? They will have to live with that horror every day for the rest of their lives. I'm opening the door to that torment. To the place where their punishment truly begins. - I like the 9-11. - Yeah, me too. I like the little guy though. That's, uh, that's personal. Personal? I mean, it was just like you said it'd be out there. Plastic people everywhere. But I belong here with you. Well, then get ready to fight. Now we put the piggy in the chair. - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Who's the piggy? - Kill the piggy. - Kill the piggy! - Kill the piggy. - Kill the piggy! - Kill the piggy. - Kill the piggy! Now imagine we just yanked this piggy out of his car. I want you to look at him and I want you to stare at him and I want you to scare him to death! Now we could tie him up and we could scare the piggy into willing us all of his money. We could kill his family in front of him but I need you to give this gift to me. Are you willing to die for me, Tex? Are you willing to let me kill you? Yeah, Charlie. Charlie, you can kill me. You can kill me. I'm ready. I'm ready. We put the piggy in the chair. You can kill me, Charlie. - I can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me. - We can kill you. - You can kill me! - We can kill you. - You can kill me! - We can kill you! - You can kill me! - We can kill you! - You can kill me! - We can kill you! - You can kill me! Tex Watson's gone. He doesn't exist anymore. Now there's just this. A body named Tex that carries around a little piece of Charlie. A little piece of the infinite. It's Charlie Manson, baby. Yeah, for Terry. Yeah, well, I can call back, but.. Yeah, man, I dig. That's cool. I can call back. That's no problem. Alright. You think I don't know you're there, Terry? You think I don't know you're there? I'll burn your fucking eyes out with this fucking cigarette. You fucking weasel fuck. Oh. Hello. Welcome. Do I know you? Uh, no, no, I'm just looking for Terry. Terry Melcher. I've been to a few parties here. - Hey, have I met you before? - No. Well, um.. ...Terry moved to Malibu, so he's not here. But are you a friend of Terry's? - Please come in if you want. - No, no, thank you. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Thank you. - Well, of course. ...world-famous director Roman Polanski. Beautiful Sharon Tate had no way of knowing the horrific tragedy that would soon befall her. I can feel very alone at a party on the set or in general if I'm not in harmony with the things around me. I'm very sensitive to ugly situations. I'm quick to read people and I pick up if someone's reacting to me as just a sexy blond. Times like those, I freeze. Lord Jesus.. Who would you like to be in your next life? I open up the door to my heart. Please come in and forgive my sins. No! Dig. The time is now, man. Helter Skelter. You go into Terry Melcher's old house and you make it look like blackie's work. Couple of weeks ago, me and Mary went on an acid run in Hollywood, you know. Even though they gave us this, this really special stuff called Orange Sunshine. And when we got outside we were convinced that we were invisible. Yeah. So we hitched a ride over the Canyon, right and the driver, all of a sudden, he just jerks around and he starts screaming at us, you know, like "Who are you? What the fuck are you doing to my car?" So we realized that we actually were invisible and what Charlie said was true. Once you burn every thought out of your head.. ...there's nothing left for anyone else to see. So we were staring into the setting sun.. ...and.. ...it felt like we were looking right at God. And I realized.. ...I realized that the closer the sun got to setting the closer I knew the end of the world was. What Charlie said was true. The apocalypse is at hand and the present world is dying. From then on, I haven't had a trace of doubt in my mind. It's coming down and it's coming down fast. Please. Please, just take me with you. Please just let me live to have my baby. Please. Kill her. No, no, no. Adorned with bright, shiny things I see that as something totally pure and beautiful. And what do you make of some of the dark subjects in your husband's films? Everything that's realistic has some sort of ugliness in it. Even a flower is ugly when it wilts.. Sadie, can you, please, turn it down? The ocean when it becomes violent. Was informative interesting but so graphic. I saw Lulu blushing when she was reading it. I wasn't. Karlene, don't take this the wrong way but are you a lesbian? This seems kind of like a lesbian book. No, I'm not, Susan. Oh. I'm sorry. And glad. It's against the Lord's way and I would worry for you. Well, we will have to agree to disagree there. You can tell us if you are. I won't pass judgment on you. It's just that you dress that way and you never talk about your husband, so.. My husband and I split up a year ago. I don't like... talking about him much. He's not a good man. I never saw you as someone who would be with a bad man. There are a lot of things about all of you that I would never guess from looking at you. Like, did you really believe that you were going to find an underground cave and live that way during the revolution? So much of what you've told me doesn't make logical sense. How would you survive in a cave? We wanted to believe something big was gonna happen. I mean.. Do you remember in 1969.. ...it really felt like there was gonna be a huge cosmic shift and things were never gonna be the same? Like there was gonna be some big thing that was gonna change everything? Come on, Karlene.. ...you were there. Didn't it feel that way to you? Yeah, it did. It felt that way to most people I know. But it didn't make them kill strangers. But we had to. It was for.. For what? What was it for? My hand hurts. The... the knife didn't have a proper handle and it just kept hitting the bone. So it's all going down like Charlie said? Yeah.. It's pretty heavy. But... but it's like Charlie said. "If you love everything then you don't have to think about things." Right? - Right on. - Okay. - What was it like? - The people were very young. It didn't seem right. But it was the right thing to do. Charlie asked me to do it and I did it. No ego. No trip. Charlie taught us that death and life are the same thing so there's nothing to be afraid of. You can't be afraid if you don't exist. Yeah. Honey, can you rub my feet just for a minute? It's always just for a minute. That will be Cory letting us know she got in okay. Get up. Stand over here. Last night was too messy. Tonight we're gonna go out and we're gonna get it right. Uh-huh? I wanna go. You come along then. Well.. ...there's two people in there. I got them ready for ya. They're calm. Don't freak them out. Do something witchy. And find your own way home. What are you gonna do? You're gonna kill us, aren't you? Did he say to kill them? - You're gonna kill us. Please, don't do this. Where's my wife? I have a chest full of money at the store. Please. No! No! No! No! No! No! Come on. Rosemary! Rosemary! No! No! I got money! I got money! I got money! I got money! What are you doing? Go take care of her. Go! Get away from me! Get away! Get away! Somebody help us! Somebody help! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Get away! Tex! No! No! Tex! Come on now, Lulu. Charlie says everyone has to do something. It was all for nothing. We did those horrible things for nothing. Lulu, we did what we had to do. Call me Leslie now, please. My name is Leslie. We didn't have to do any of it. But we did. And why? Do you know why, Katie? Sadie? Why did we do those things? Jimmy?
