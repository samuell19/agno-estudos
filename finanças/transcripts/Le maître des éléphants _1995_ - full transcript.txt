Is it a chain it's dragging? Yes, we'll take care of it And giving it back to the foresters is out of question Hello Hello A young male. A female with a gash in its ear A male with a single tusk Were they together? Hey, isn't that a family? And you only saw that? Did you sleep? - No, I haven't slept, Boss I saw gazelles, giraffes, the sassaby, the horse and the warthog Martin, stay around Thanks I don't understand The elephants have disappeared Now in this season, I don't know, there should be about 200 here Nobody knows where they are Not even old Kambou These footprints are from last year, you see The white man in Daktari Yes, I know Hello Doctor - Hello Garoubier My son Martin - Hello Martin How are you? How was your flight? OK, come on, I'll introduce you to some friends Amina, my nurse Tiki, a friend Martin Garoubier What do you attend? What class are you in? 7th grade - 7th grade? Ah that's good General - Oh Doctor Here's a candidate for you He's the superintendent of the school Martin Garoubier - How old are you? I'm 12. And he's in 7h grade - 12 in 7th grade, that's good Sit down Hello, do you want something to drink? - No thanks General, what are we doing for the boy? He'll be registered, Doctor, there's no problem They killed your mother You're not going to stay here I hope you'll enjoy where you gonna go Stay with me Does it scratch you? What do you mean? You don't want to leave? You know you'll be much better off there Are you tired, Toto? Don't worry Go on First of all, a new student Martin Garoubier He comes from France He's the son of Mr Garoubier who's in charge of the Reserve He'll frequent With you In class of 7th grade M1 He doesn't have school uniform yet But exceptionally, he's authorized to frequent From tomorrow He'll be dressed like everyone else Come in! Come in! Martin, go sit next to Fofana Miss Lormo, you move to the bench in front of you Today we're going to talk about borders In the case of Africa We were not asked to determine our borders There are people who met, white people, in 1885, in Berlin And who said... Belgian said "we want this part" French said "we want that part" English said "we want this other part" And that's how we got countries who are now English- or French-speaking countries And it gave us some pretty funny situations I don't know if you know... You probably know There are families who have the living room in Cameroon and the kitchen in Gabon Right? There are other even more dramatic situations You hear about Rwanda and Burundi What happened? They drew a line And so there are scattered ethnic groups There are tribes that never got along who are in the same territory In the case of Rwanda, we're talking about Tootsies and Hutus So the question of borders is extremely important Wait... - What? I wanted to tell you The people of my village love your father very much Thanks The villagers do not question the reports But the issue is the amount of compensation and especially given the payment periods So let's make a deal right away and you'll get paid as soon as possible It's not about the money But stopping someone from... from hunting for food, for me, it's a crime This is when I wonder if the Reserve is useful Excuse us Why didn't the Prefect come? He's on a mission it seems Note, it's better. With the zealous young man, we won't be able to agree today Oh, good timing! - Excuse me Garoubier, I know it's very important How's it going? - Well, like all meetings... I need a school uniform - Oh listen, now is not the right time Do you know he's in my class? - Very well How are you? How are you? You know I'm in a weird school We're more than a thousand But you are no longer tied! Hold on! What are you doing with this monkey? You don't have the right, you have to leave it Toto! Catch it and put it in a cage! No need to pout Try to understand In a year it will be out of control You don't want it to end up in a zoo? Anyway, I already told you, it doesn't belong here Adam will keep it at home before putting it back in the bush What's wrong? But what are you doing here? Are you crazy? What did you shoot there? What did you shoot? What did you shoot? You're really starting to piss me off! You must never go alone in the Reserve! Then I never want to see you with a gun again! Get in! You understand? And don't pout! You met a nice friend Write a portrait of him This is the subject of today's essay And you have 2 hours to do it That's long enough, it's a pretty rich subject I count on you to give me back 2 or 3 pages minimum Are you going to do my portrait? Go on! Go ahead, get to work! Victor, I present to you Martin, Garoubier's son - I know He's Tenga, my musician friend He is a Hama, like Fofana Hello - Hello how are you? Watch out, the Hamas are hard as rocks And you, what are you? I'm nothing, I'm cursed, I've no village Victor? - Yes! Come help us, Martin. Take the funnel And put that on the table What are you saying? We said that you're smart While the others go to school, you make money with your garage Here, taste this Is this edible? I've been to 7 guard posts. 5 were deserted There was nobody So one day it's a funeral, then a wedding One day it's I don't know what, ill, other things... No! Boss, you know the budget and staffing problem we've had since last year. No, no, it's not the numbers If everyone does their job, it fits So you do yours, already It's really not the good time! I never saw your father like this It's because I'm here - No, it's because he has too many worries Try Amina, where's the fabric? - I gave it to the tailor Why didn't you bring it home? You know I sew I gave some work to the old man, Mum You have to be careful with the money It's your turn - It's yours So Martin plays then? I invaded your camp I didn't invade Martin's camp So what do you do? It's your turn Ah, it's not killed! - It's killed! Look! It goes here But I'm often the one who's killed! Why? You, stop laughing, we didn't talk to you, with Fofana My turn, I'll kill Fofana You can't kill Fofana - Wait Too wide... But you mustn't cry It's your turn to start Go over there - You, you You have already shot Oh yes, yes! - Oh no, no Where, wait, where? Look! Don't cheat, little white! Where? But no! Look! He came around here No, Martin, you must not cheat We don't want things like that - Alright! Alright! On a red - OK Yellow Shit, some clients! Thank you Victor! - You're welcome Petrol vendors are like that... I'm dirty. I'm going to change my clothes Who's she? What? She's my mother It was last July, in Pouldreuzic Is that your mother? Come, let's go to the bush Stop Martin. You can't cross it, it's a sacred bridge Why is it a sacred bridge? - It's reserved for initiated You can't cross And you? Are you initiated? They're not happy to see you But don't worry Fobena, she's the boss here She said you're cute, but she wants to know if you're strong I want to know if you're strong, or not She said you do arm wrestling Come here Careful, huh! Go Martin Fobena! Fobena! Fobena! This is the hut for young people - The hut for young people? Yes, for lovers When you want to know if the girl likes you You have a rendez-vous You put the stick here If the stick disappears, that means she's ok Do we put it like this? - Yes ♪ Don't be afraid, I love you! ♪ ♪ I'm with you! ♪ ♪ Supreme Promise, ♪ ♪ Who supports my faith. ♪ Hello Martin - Hello Angèle When you come with your friends, play outside Don't come inside, you're making a mess ♪ No, never alone, ♪ ♪ No, never alone, ♪ ♪ Jesus my Savior protect me, ♪ ♪ Never leave me alone. ♪ Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Sit down Who put this? Martin, is this Fofana's place? Where's Fofana? Can someone tell me where Fofana is? Alright, sit down Take your math notebooks The intersection of the two sets, A and B Is the set of their common elements OK? Set A which has as elements 1... 2... "The old woman with her sharp cutlass was leaving." "In the big hut" "She had cut the throat" "to all those who lay" "next to the bed." "The earth was cold." "Samba of the Night" "woke up his brothers" "near whom lay," "with cut heads," "the daughters of the old woman." "He took them out of the big hut." "Arid Lands" "where were drying" "cotton stalks." "And the first rooster crowed." This is a political issue I don't want to pay Either way, I can't pay And there are no more elephants... So there will be no more tourists So we will close the Reserve And there will be no more problems, and everyone will be happy With the villager... Is it fixed? - Oh no, I'll call him OK - I'll do - Ok Good evening - Good evening Kobio Good evening - Good evening President How are you? - I'm fine, President. Is Jolier coming? - Political meeting Hello Sir - By the way, do you know where Fofana went? Fofana has disappeared Fofana? - Yeah And there was a fetish on his bench A fetish? It's not a good sign You're not going to tell me that you're afraid of fetishes? Not afraid of fetishes But I go serenely and fetishes, I don't trust them We can do Western medicine and everything Being African, you always have to be careful, always... Because you never know And do you have any idea what happened to him? Maybe Kambou entrusted him with a mission Old Kambou? - Yes Fofana is like a son for him. You didn't know? - No Surprising that he didn't tell me about it Fofana, is he on a mission? - I don't know Fofana's parents are very poor They have a debt with the Sorcerer And they probably gave their son to him How long? I don't know. The time to clear their debt I know there's a newcomer to the blacksmiths Oh no! The Sorcerer can't have done that You can deal with them, but not the Hamas What is this blacksmith story The blacksmiths... The blacksmiths deal with the forces of Evil And we avoid them You think Fofana is the newcomer? - Maybe Do you know where the blacksmiths are? It's a cursed place. We can't go there Tell me where it is! You can't go there. The Sorcerer will kill you No, he wouldn't do that - He will! He's the one who sold Fofana to the blacksmiths Why? - It's dangerous It's very dangerous In fact the Sorcerer is at war with Kambou Because of the elephants I can't leave Martin alone You can leave him, the Sorcerer won't do anything against the little white You stay quiet I'm not afraid of the Sorcerer Moreover he won't know What? The Sorcerer knows everything He sees everything. Even without his eyes Oh! You're afraid of me? What were you doing? Uh... I was doing business Let's go? We can't cross! - Why can't we cross? It's a sacred bridge I know, it's a sacred bridge If we can't cross, we won't go Is there no other way? - There's another way, but this one is better Where is the other way? - Over there! Come! It's over there? - Yes Do you know why the panther eats a lot of sheep? No... Here, in Africa men have a lot of of cola. The girls fall at their feet What is cola? Cola... It's something that we eat. And it's very strong good to do the work too and to live with the girls We should cross the river here Here? - Yes! Are you crazy? Alright... Come on! Let's go Hold on! We're going to make an offering to the river's spirit Get in! Why do fetishes have their heads cut off? They are already dead. Here! Fofana's did not have his head cut off - Yes Does that mean he's alive? - Yes Drink! Now... Now you have to give something My shirt? - No, something from you What? Hair is good White people's hair is limp, right? My uncle Bedidi killed a lot He killed a lion He saw a crocodile trained like a dog He says to the crocodile "go and kill" And the crocodile went into the water and ate it He went to eat Where do you go? It's not the good direction You don't know where it is? Of course I know. Don't worry It's over there. We'll go up, and then we'll go down, and then we'll go up It's over there! A legend around here A bat Fofana is here How are you, Fofana? We brought you some food Here What's going on, Fofana? What did he tell you? He said we can't stay here He's here to do work, he said. For a long time How long? Two years! Two years! - Yes... Why did Fofana not want to talk to me? The Hamas are proud. He's ashamed There are peanuts - Are these peanuts? Oh yum-yum! - Yum-yum? Shit! The landowner Well, keep me informed, right? I tell you, I'm crossing the border tonight and I'll spend a week there If it goes wrong, call the family! What's wrong with the car there? - It's out of order Since when? - Since yesterday evening And how did you take Martin to school this morning? He wasn't here What do you mean "he wasn't here"? I don't know... Well where is he? - I haven't seen him New York? - Yes, New York This is where I want to make music There are good musicians there Alright, I have to go home See you tomorrow! What did you do? Where were you? - It's not your business! How is that not my business? Are you kidding me? I do what I want! What do you mean, you do what you want? For me, you don't exist. You've never been here Don't talk to me like that They always told Mom you were a jerk Well... It's true! I've left for two days and it's a mess Yes Boss - Yeah Did you know where he was? - Yes Boss You knew where he was! - No boss You don't care Your son is wandering too What are you doing here? - I'm leaving Really? Anyway, I don't think you're concerned And I even think that if I wasn't there, it would be better for you You left us And because of you, she died Stop the bullshit! It's not bullshit. I'll look for Fofana Because you know where he is? He is at the blacksmiths Did you go as far as the Kalin of Fire? If Fofana is at the blacksmiths It's all about money I can help you Old Kambou doesn't really like the Sorcerer He told me to be careful We'll see... So the Sorcerer is okay with me buying the debt I just paid the two-year debt for Fofana but it's not enough He lost his name He lost his name? Well, Fofana as a Hama no longer exists I need to pay to get his name back Yes, yes It's more expensive than the debt Why? A name can't be thrown away The Sorcerer could entrust the name to a tree Or to an animal - to an animal? As I paid, I must go Give the name! Give the name! Fofana got his name back The old Kambou came to thank me for Fofana I understand what old Kambou meant But now if I really want to protect the elephants I have to lock them in the Reserve We should build a fence, as they do in other countries But keeping them from moving, to me, is... ... it's like killing them, somehow They're great nomads You know, in the past, they walked all over Africa Freely It was your mother who wanted to come to Africa It was her dream We called you... "Little steps" When you were around 2 years old Because at night you woke up very often You came to see us in our room Then you entered our bed And you came tip-toeing. That's why, you see... Then, you brought our heads together, like that, for us to kiss You were almost squeezing us Then you stayed between us, as if you were going back to sleep But you were leaving Don't you remember that? Let's go to a party, go! "Little steps" So Hassan, how are you? My son How are you? Is Boubka around? - No, he's not here, why? Applause, thank you very much! And right after Mr Blues... Karouda! We applaud loudly for them! Karouda! Well, I don't introduce you Does that mean there's no more school? Yes, the school will be closed until the end of the year Martin, are you coming? Martin! Martin! Martin! Ah, here come the lovers You come? - Yes! Do you want us to bathe? Four boys for one girl, is that serious? You're greedy - Leave us alone Martin, come on, let's go! We have to leave them alone Do you like black girls? Black girls are beautiful, right? White girls too I want to ride every night! But I have a little bangala What's a bangala? It's something you put there, and it makes click-click-click I'll make a song for Tengo because he's nice Maybe one day, I'll make a song for you too because you're nice And I have an idea for a song Do you like music too? - Yeah Who is he? He's the Sorcerer's assistant I wonder what he's doing with that white man I'm not going to be here for 2 or 3 days Will you manage? Yes, yes Why? It's modern What are you doing Victor? - I hide everything! What's happening? It's not good with the military The petrol I sell is from Nigeria On the other hand, I sell palm wine We go to the bush to get some What's palm wine? It's in the trees How are you? Shhht... Come It's old Kambou, the Master of the Elephants He's with Fofana What is he saying? They're too far. I can't hear Maybe he's giving him his secret In the past, my ancestors had no village They lived in the bush with their herds But at night the lions attacked them Many men were eaten by lions The Sorcerer went to the elephant and asked for protection The elephant answered "I'll protect you on my lands" "if you behave with the wisdom of an elephant" But now the elephants are gone Why do you think they left? Maybe in the village a man wasn't as wise as an elephant Old Kambou is calling me The Air Force... The Air Force bills me for a helicopter that was useless We flew over the Reserve They searched for the rebel camps but we didn't do anything about the big herds In addition they were very happy to be filmed Are you going to intervene there? Don't let the elephants get slaughtered almost at the border No, we can't do anything Everything that happens there does not concern us But then the rebels arm the poachers, don't they? The rebels primed the pump And poachers now directly supply weapons to the guerrillas And you're just waiting for them to be fully armed, aren't you? Our mission is to keep the northern border to prevent infiltration Right now the market is simple They trade a tusk for a crate of Kalashnikovs When they're all armed, you won't be able to do anything And they'll come here to loot or kill... and here, it won't be elephants What do you think we can do? A commando operation? In a foreign country? Oh Doctor Hello Garoubier. are you coming to see the old Kambou? Yes I have to see him - But how did you know? What? You're not aware? Well, I think he was poisoned Fofana Fofana Yes, Fofana Wait for me here We were just going out for an hour It's the Sorcerer's assistant who judges Tenga I think I know why It was when I was with Victor There was also Tenga Nobody will believe that in the village Do you think Tenga is innocent? I think yes But to be sure, there's only one way It's to find the elephants How can we go there? I know the tracks Martin! You're leaving for Yaoundé on Thursday That way, and it's better, you won't lose a school year You know that doesn't make me happy? And if it doesn't work well here, I'll meet you there Come What happened? It's contraband petrol that exploded A child burned Sorry There was an explosion but... the little Victor was in it Come on, don't stay here I'm going to make a song for Tenga because he's nice Maybe one day, I'll make a song for you too Is it for Victor? I write "To Victor, my musician friend" I think he will be happy if you write in his language How do we say that? "Sobajo bombado" "Sobajo bombado" "Sobajo bombado" To Victor, my musician friend Sobajo bombado Look Everything is ready He's going to meet the ancestors And there's even a stick to help him walk The Sorcerer has decided: The red ants will eat Tenga Tenga? Eaten alive by red ants? - Yes We wait for them to leave and we'll free him We can't do anything If you told me the truth for the elephants We might have a chance to save him We need to hurry up Wait! What's the matter? I feel like we're being followed Don't worry! Is it the one which had your name? Yes, it'll accompany us Why is it growling? It feels something But where is he? He still hasn't vanished? He has to catch his plane soon You told me he was coming right back, didn't you? Maybe he's in the village It's impossible What would he do in the village? It came to guide us but it doesn't like the panther They're too many Do you think they can attack us? I don't know what they have Come on, hurry up! Follow me, Martin! You know that Martin is with Fofana But you don't know where they are? No one in the village can tell me where they went? Do you think they're going to smash the roof? Fofana! I'm thirsty No more water Shit! I'm not far though Untie him! Hurry up! He tries to find out who it is Fofana, I think we're in a minefield... That's enough! Enough! I want to surrender - Don't! I can ask them to guide you I want them to walk with you And if the search fails, then I will accept their judgment They're thirsty! Look at the smoke It must be the poachers' camp They block the the elephants' path Let's go! It's Koabila the traitor Is he the Sorcerer's assistant? - Yes You see there, it's 150 kg Traitor I'm OK! I'm OK! You're hurt? - Yes Can't you walk anymore? - Do it alone What? Go get them. Bring back the elephants Me? Yes you! Here With Adjinakou Adjinakou? Yes, with this necklace, it'll follow you Adjinakou Adjinakou, I'm going to explain you everything Fofana is injured He's the one who sent me Look! You have to come with me You have to follow me with the others Adjinakou! Adjinakou! Dad! English subtitles by Marseille and DreamScape *** TNT 2022 ***
