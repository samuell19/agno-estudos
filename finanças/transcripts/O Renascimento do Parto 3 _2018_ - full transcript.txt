Son! Son! Son! My God! Hold him! Son! Son! -Look at the baby's mouth. -Son! Son! Son. Is everything alright? Everything is great! But he's not breathing. -Of course he is. -Look at his face. Yes, he is. He's fine. I know, but he... He's fine, he's perfect. He's fine. He's breathing through his belly button. Is he breathing? Yes, through the cord. He cried. Son! That's crazy! My child. My God! Son! This is not of this world. My God! Here, they are angels, right? They are here. The medical team are the angels who are here to strengthen our children. Then, it's God... I always tell the nurses. It's God in heaven and them on Earth! If they were not here, our children wouldn't be here so we could tell you this great story, right? -When he was born... -I wanted you to play music... When he was born, his foot was as big as my thumb. We took pictures but you don't see it because of the reflection. But if you want, I'll send them to you. I just want to add something. We want to give an advice to parents who have a child in the ICU. THE RENAISSANCE OF CHILDBIRTH 3 OBSTETRIC DOCTOR The house of childbirth many times was the midwife's home. A traditional midwife. OBSTETRIC NURSE Since the women who come to give birth here are low risk, the probability of using this is low. DENTIST I really wanted to have a home birth, since ever. JOURNALIST There was a very tense moment. Her heartbeat and the baby's heartbeat were compromised. AUTHOR OF THE FILM "ORGASMIC BIRTH" - U.S. MIDWIFE AND PERINATAL EDUCATOR Oxygen saturation in the womb for the baby is lower than ours outside. So all babies are born purple. OBSTETRIC NURSE In the Netherlands they have always been reserved in their tradition and culture. OBSTETRIC NURSE GERMANY MIDWIFE AND PSYCHOLOGIST You can do it, love. I think I'm horny. Yes. -Do you want to kiss me? -Yes. -Give him a very tasty kiss. -Right, get in there. Can I give you a kiss? Daughter? Come. New Zealand went through a strong system of childbirth medicalization where women went to the hospital and suffered interventions. There was a huge movement and the women said: "Enough, enough! We're fed up with that type of attention! Birth is ours!" It was founded the New Zealand College of Midwives, the obstetric nurses started to change their credentials. They all began to put midwives, to have that union. If she chose that midwife and wasn't satisfied, didn't identify herself with her, couldn't create a bond, she can change midwives. There are birthing houses and the option of home birth. Cesarean section is seen as a very complex procedure, that increases the risks, and they don't understand: "How can a person opt for surgery when it's not really necessary?" It's not an option available in the system. Until the sixth week after delivery, that midwife goes to your house to accompany breastfeeding, check the baby's weight. All paid by the government, it's part of the system. What a dream, right? The birth house many times was the house of the midwife. A traditional midwife, right? In regions of Brazil where public health hasn't yet arrived. Today the Angela House provides services to the Unified Health System… HOUSE ANGELA, SÃO PAULO - SP …and is paid for service rendered. Doing moxa acupuncture. We will also do a uterus massage in a while... with anthroposophic oil, so that the contractions begin. We don't induce labor. We don't use oxytocin, for example. In the community, near her house, her family participates. We use non-pharmacological resources a lot and we encourage the autonomy of women. All you need to have a birth... in the most natural way possible. More than 40% of our births occur in the water. The basic equipment includes an ambulance. Women can come 24 hours a day, with any doubt, any problem, any difficulty in breastfeeding. Because that's the most important thing after discharge. We also put posts of collection of breast milk. Son, call dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. My little baby My little baby Now you will begin to know Who I am and who you are Since ever, I had wanted a lot to have a home birth. And, unfortunately, the time of delivery we had was very long and there was a moment when our midwife said: "You better go to the hospital." It was a wonderful, humanized birth. I know I took him and he went straight to her. He was fed 45 minutes. They didn't cut the cord until it stopped pulsing, Serginho cut it at the right time. Tomás wasn't punctured, pricked, manipulated, in any time until he stopped breastfeeding. What we gained with that was an extremely calm baby and that was near me, skin to skin, for two days in the room. Leaving the baby under observation, after he's born... Observation of what? The time for him to be with his mother is right after he's born so that the mother adapts to him and he adapts to the mother. It seems that the newborn doesn't belong to anyone. When he's born, he doesn't belong to the mother or the father. He's in the hands of the institution. When the family is already enlightened and doesn't want any procedure to be done, they make a rejection term. But it should be the opposite. We should ask for an authorization term. We can't avail ourselves of a patient's body without him authorizing it. The vernix is ​​the white layer with which he's born. It regulates the baby's temperature and moisturizes the skin. The baby is not born dirty and doesn't need to bathe after birth. There are those who bathe seven or ten days after birth. Here in Brazil, silver nitrate is still used routinely, which is an eye drop exclusively used if the mother has gonorrhea during labor. And here we often have a baby that was born from a caesarean, didn't pass through the vaginal canal and the silver nitrate is applied. In the prenatal we know if the woman has gonorrhea or syphilis... You were ready, right? Was it spontaneous? Yes. We suggest parents and mothers who have their children in the ICU. UCI FATHERS GROUP Something good happened. But he ends up in the ICU. I was in the birth room watching the birth screen and there my son was born. -Was it surgical? -I saw... -Was it surgical? -Yes. It was a cesarean. When I got in, I got really scared. He had an intravenous tube, a purple foot, a swollen leg. And what was his diagnosis? He had water in the lung. WATER IN THE LUNGS The water broke. It broke and there were no contractions. THE WATER BROKE And then, we came directly here. We arrived here and the doctor said: "It broke, you'll have to stay." Then I got scared, because he was 36 weeks old. It was very advanced. He had water in his lungs… 36 WEEKS …and had to be treated to expel water from his lungs. But, thank God, everything went well and my son is fine, thank God. My friends' babies grow 50 grams per day. -They're here all day. -It's a blessing! A blessing! It's God... I always tell the nurses. It's God in heaven and them on Earth! If they were not here, our children wouldn't be here so we could tell you this great story, right? -Who's next? -How are you? I have a documentary team and I want access to the maternity to pay a visit, know the facilities and everything. And talk to someone from the medical team. I'm going to sit there and call. Alright? Thank you! It's the baby that activates birth. Only the baby can say that he's ready to be born. It's not the doctor, the mother, the midwife, the nurse. Each child has a time to learn to walk. Each child has a time to learn to talk. And we respect that time. Why don't we respect their time to be born? Some are ready with 37 weeks and they are born well. -With 35! -Breathing, you understand? -Some only with 42. -Exactly. My son was a normal childbirth and my daughter wasn't. Right. -She wasn't a normal birth. -And they were twins. They were twins, eight hours apart, and to this today they do what they want. They are different beings. He was born completely fine and she stayed in transverse position. Contractions stopped. There wasn't anything they could do, they made the external cephalic inversion in the surgical center, with the ultrasound, they turned her over, she went cephalic again, had bradycardia and, in five minutes, she was transverse again. My God! Guys! That's crazy! My baby! My God! Hello, dear! My God! I made it! In Holland, in 1400, the first midwife was hired by the municipality. In 1600, midwifery schools were opened. If you're sick, go to the hospital. Otherwise, you deliver at home. It's obvious you do it at home. Very few birthing houses, because either the delivery is at home or in the hospital, which has wonderful conditions too. Midwives work in shifts even if no one is in labor. The groups of pregnant women work in the empowerment of the woman in her delivery. There is a professional that attends only postpartum, to help clean the house, and she spends her day helping. The midwives, after having attended the prenatal and delivery, send that data about the childbirth to the government and receive money from the government, after they have registered online, on the computer, it's amazing. It's a system of mutual trust. If the person can't pay, the government is the one who pays. It's a very egalitarian system for all women. I was dilated five centimeters and I was admitted. And then, the oxytocin. I thought it would take a while, but it was quick. SYNTHETIC OXYTOCIN Suddenly, the contractions were strong, one after the other. I didn't have time to relax, recover, breathe between one and another. What condemned my labor was oxytocin. My husband was with me at that moment, which made me... endure it for some time, three hours of oxytocin... or four, more or less... because I was leaning on him. And he supported me, I hugged him hard waiting for it to stop. That unbearable pain. "Look, you are not dilating... you'll need a caesarean." Such a sadness! And I remember saying something like: "Heavens, you force it so hard and then send me to the cesarean." But I was relieved and I said: "Then I want anesthesia." I wanted anesthesia immediately, that the pain stopped, because it was unbearable. I felt very fragile. When the nurse brought my son, already dressed, with his hat. I looked at him and it seemed so strange, because I didn't feel any emotion when I saw my son. And I thought: "Heavens, is this right?" It was very strange. After the surgery, my husband couldn't stay with me. I spent the night freezing... worried about my son... not knowing how he was. I have... a feeling of... of abandonment... that is overwhelming. That is one thing that reflects on my motherhood, my being a mother. I... I am a very insecure mother. I... never imagined it would be like that. That marked my motherhood. I always… I think I won't be able to handle motherhood, to be a mother, to take care of my son alone. The Federal Public Ministry, since the first complaints of obstetric violence, has acted to demand respect to the law that determines everything that a hospital must have to offer material and physical resources for a normal and humanized delivery. That brings administrative consequences for the hospital and the doctor and, depending on the case, civil and criminal consequences. Put it there. Put it there. Report to the Federal Public Ministry to open an investigation, report to SUS, Procon, if it's related to a healthcare plan, denounce in the ANS and start legal process. Write down the name of the professional, the nurse, the doctor. She has to report it, because without the denunciations, we can't improve. They don't accept the birth plan. They ignore the birth plan. Most professionals don't know what a birth plan is. Most women don't know that it's an agreement... between the professional of assistance and the pregnant woman. It's the rational use of medicalization. Do you want to go through an anesthetic? No, I don't. Write it down. Your partner, your mother, your friend, your partner. Who do you want on your side? Write it down. So at that moment, when the woman won't have condition to negotiate... she's covered by a document where there there's been negotiation. It's an amusement park in here. Don't leave it a mess. Let me film you with them too. -Film, film! -I have to film you! You have to be on film, or nobody will believe. Now how do I do it? -It's already filming. -Is it? Or nobody will believe. Nobody will believe you had the courage. Yes, film her standing. Baby, baby. What a cry, baby! Can you imagine it? At night? Bye. -Bye! -Bye, bye! Obstetric violence, a complex issue with various factors in a statistical expression. Specific cases have been reported... An emerging topic on the agenda of human rights in Brazil. CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES - BRASILIA - BF This stimulates the representations. That they have access to those alternative representations and from there, yes, they will be able to carry out their work to promote human rights of women in general, even in its specifications. So, in general terms, divisions are portrayed of the representations about the race, gender and sexual orientation. We seek to infer what are the predominant representations… MY BODY, MY BREAST, MY RULES! …among the people who attend childbirth. You can do it. I think I'm horny. Yes. -Do you want to give me a kiss? -Yes. -Give him a very tasty kiss. -Right, get in there. -Can I give you a kiss? -Yes. It was such a pain that I couldn't stand. I couldn't speak. I couldn't... I think I couldn't breathe well. I was on all fours in the middle of the room... for hours. It was magical, it was in our house, in the same place we made her, we delivered her. -She's in the shower. -Yes. Right, right, right. SUS, right of the Brazilian people! SUS, right of the Brazilian people! SUS, right of the Brazilian people! SUS, right of the Brazilian people! SUS HERITAGE OF THE BRAZILIAN PEOPLE SUS, right of the Brazilian people! SINGLE HEALTH SYSTEM: BRAZILIAN HERITAGE Orientations, courses, the birth plan, that I didn't know existed. -Me neither. -And it makes me think. Why aren't there more places like this one? We have everything for neonatal resuscitation if it's necessary to use. A warm cradle, which is the source of radiant heat, the vacuum cleaner, the oxygen, the oximeter, the birth kits. Since the women who come to give birth here are low risk, the probability of using this is low. We use this room for delivery and also for postpartum, right? Here is the space we also use to examine the baby. We try to make childbirth very cozy. The woman chooses the position she wants to be in during labor and delivery. Kate is our nursing technique here at the Wide House. -Foot test. -Foot test. Here is pure love. Pure, genuine, all the time. Today we have a wider concept of not just evidence-based medicine, but also evidence-based health. Because other specialties have joined, like nursing, psychology. Did you hear your baby? Yes. Did you check your pressure? Yes. Did you put your hand on your belly? Yes. "Because the woman went to several maternities and she wasn't attended in any of them." Actually, it was her request that wasn't met, which was to do a cesarean section. Disinformation, pain and distrust. They are the three great reasons that lead a mother to choose a cesarean before trying normal delivery. The woman has the right. Does she do a liposuction? Yes. She has a right over the son. I'm sure of that. But I also have the right to refuse to do a procedure that increases the risk that this woman dies, of this baby dying, in comparison to normal delivery. We are also talking about morbidity, of complications. We have professionals that are available 24 hours a day. Disposition is related to their profile. It's much more related to the nurse, obstetrician, midwife. And technical deficiency. Generalist doctors who have never seen a delivery in the university. Some institutions prohibit male obstetrician nurses. They say that the woman won't feel comfortable. But she'll feel comfortable with a doctor in the private institution? If there is an obstetrician doctor, why can't there be obstetric nurse? I was immersed, completely immersed, within the traditional medical context. I worked in a university hospital, inside a delivery room. So, I chose my best friend to be my obstetrician, because she wouldn't fool me and she wouldn't do anything that wasn't right by me. We went to the hospital and I was starting to have very light contractions. And then he gave me an induction. She put a pill of Misoprostol without warning me. Immediately, I started having many contractions, one after another. His heart wasn't recovering well anymore. Then it was an emergency cesarean. I didn't know about that induction and I just knew it... many years later. I made an unnecessary cesarean out of fear and then I discovered the movement of humanization. That transformed me as a woman and also as a doctor. And Bianca was born at home. Right, Bibi? It was a home birth, very calm, very serene and that brought me that dimension. Of the opportunity to live this experience. And from there, my way of acting as a doctor changed a lot too. So today I attend on that humanized model, that allows the woman to be a protagonist, respecting the physiology of childbirth. -I want to hold it. -Do you? Watch out! Look, my baby! Look, my baby! You were born! You were born, beautiful. Hi, mom, there was some pee that didn't let be born. MATERNAL BLINDNESS LOW STATURE OF THE MOTHER CANDIDIASIS LOW WEIGHT OF THE MOTHER BROKEN WATER FOR 80 HOURS BROKEN WATER RAIN THREAT IN THE CITY CONGENITAL CROOKED FOOT FETAL CARDIAC MALFORMATION "TIME WAS UP" DEGREE III, II OR I PLACENTA LOW PLACENTA It hurts! -How do we know it will stop? -It will stop. It will stop. What did she do? She waved for the camera. Every week doing an ultrasound, doing an echo, doing everything, everything was perfect. We even had fetal cardiography on Tuesday. It was a ten out of ten, perfect. She woke up in the morning and said: "I don't feel well. I don't know what's wrong, I'm not fine." We called, and the doctor said: "Check if you don't have contractions. It may be time." -I was lucky to watch a video... -It was alright... that the hospital shows us. I had the opportunity of all my family see my little baby, take photos. He was born on a Friday. On Saturday they took the baby at ten a.m. so he can come back to the room at noon. And then, at noon, where was the baby? Where is Gui? I looked for the doctor and imagine my fear when she said: "Dad, I have to talk to mom too." And she gave us the news that my son went to the ICU. He had an arrest in the hands of the nurses? Yes. He had just arrived and was already purple. "HE WAS PURPLE" And how do they reanimate them? It's not like a heart massage. It's through pain, right? They revive them through the pain. With slaps on his butt. He just arrived in the world, they already hit him three times. When they can't breathe well or have a respiratory failure, they also put caffeine in the bottle with milk. Because caffeine speeds up their metabolism and they breathe well again. Then my son needed caffeine two times in a day... two different times. And another time it was all day, because he had another respiratory saturation decrease. I think that's a social construction. The newborn inside of our society. How is he inserted? People believe that the baby doesn't feel anything. There are people who still think so today. Medicine believed he didn't feel anything. You made a surgery on them without anesthesia. We pierce the babies' ears, we circumcise the boys sometimes without anesthesia. And he feels the same as an adult, only that the way to express it is different. Then they give up and don't cry anymore. You're taking your first bath. Right, auntie? You're going to mommy very clean. Right, auntie? That the baby may be born and go straight to the arms of his mother and stay there. We went through several strategies and then we chose one and we tried. And it didn't stick. And then we said: "Eduardo, Dudu, let's try." And it was when he stuck, when we called him Eduardo and he felt at ease. In Cambodia, they are in a process of hospitalization of childbirth. You stay on a gurney with your legs up, the shaving, the enema, in many places the woman has no companion, episiotomy, right? The baby is born and they cut the umbilical cord and... take him away from the mother. LUIZA'S BIRTH I'm following the good nurse. Now she goes to a nursery. LITHOTOMY The lithotomy emerged for the benefit of the doctor, right? Lying down in a non-physiological position, compressing the pelvis and hindering birth. I became a celebrity at the hospital. All the nurses came into my suite, to see the mother who was attempting a normal delivery. I said I didn't want serum, that I had everything planned and all the time a nurse said: "But don't you really want anesthesia?" And I said: "No." My daughter was crowning and a nurse told the doctor: "Won't you do an episiotomy, doctor?" And I remember that in the middle of a contraction, I shouted: "No!" EPISIOTOMY Episiotomy is genital mutilation. A completely unnecessary practice. I'm going to cut a perineum to protect it not even knowing if it will lacerate. And often the natural laceration is much smaller than an episiotomy. If she wants to stay on all fours, squatting, or standing, the possibility of lacerating is much lower than when lying down. ENEMA Intestinal lavage has been debunked many years ago. TRICHOTOMY The trichotomy, the shaving of the hairs, opens a door to infection. The pubic hair was made to protect us. DRY BIRTH About the dry birth: People say in Brazil that, when the water breaks, the baby has a certain time to be born. And that he will run out of water and won't go through the vaginal canal. The region of the vagina is still being lubricated, the liquid is replenished in our body. The doctors in Brazil artificially break the water because they want to accelerate the labor. Love! The passage of the baby through the vaginal canal… MICROBIOME …is going to do that first seeding with bacteria that will help to format in a healthy way the microbiome of the newborn, that is that baby will have much more conditions to have a more adequate immunity. That will defend him and protect him. The baby has the fontanelles here, right? We call it "moleira." And when he goes through the vaginal canal, this "moleira" fits and sometimes he's born with that head shape called a "bossa." Thirty, forty minutes later, it's gone and everything is fine with him. -Congratulations! -Thanks, doctor! Bye! Don't put your hand! -Bruno! -Thanks! They don't care about the fact that, after he's born, he needs to eat. What will they give him? A feeding bottle? A pacifier, to calm him down? Will I breastfeed? How? Who will help me? The World Health Organization suggests that we breastfeed for two years or more. It depends on the child. Three years isn't wrong. People throw dirty looks when they see a big kid being breastfed. Because it's not common. Breastfeeding usually goes up to 15 days, 20 days... Do you know the average? It's less than a month. When the mother manages to breastfeed for six months, by doctor's orders, she feels like a warrior. Then, she thinks it's no longer necessary, because she's not properly oriented. She thinks six months is fine. No, let's get on with life. And it's not. Mother's milk changes while you breastfeed. It starts as protein, and is fatty in the end. And the boy with a full stomach, when the fat arrives, considers it as satiety. So, he stops sucking. The bottle-fed child has no end, because they doesn't have that final fat. It's the same all the time. She keeps sucking, sucking and the mother says: "He's so hungry! My milk is not enough!" Because it's a bottle and she keeps crying because she didn't understand she can stop eating. The child starts to dilate the stomach. When you see, the kid is chubby. The mother is not to blame if she can't breastfeed. The blame is on those that didn't guide her in due time about how she should do it. And when the mother manages to breastfeed, she has such a strength! Hi. Who are all these people? Who is here by your side? Your dad doesn't stop crying. Dad is crying. And Teteca that doesn't stop barking. Cutest little thing. As Gandhi said, right? "First, they despise you, don't hear you. Then they ridicule you... and finally they persecute you." In 2012, the Regional Council of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro sued me in the Regional Council of Medicine of São Paulo, the Cremesp. Humanized childbirth activists ended up... getting together and we closed a lane of Paulista Avenue up to the Regional Council of Medicine of São Paulo in which banners and posters were placed supporting me. In Brazil, several cities made that march for home birth. I was very excited and said: "Look I think from a professional point of view, I can already die, because I don't have anything else to add to this movement." I have fulfilled my mission, my task, and I'm sure that... in this incarnation I came for this. If the institutions persecuted me, and keep doing so today, I say that every blow they give me, I get stronger. Because I see that I really am on the right path. Then it strengthens me in an incredible way, but because of the people that I have contact with. It's mom and dad, daughter! Thank you, daughter. Thank you, love. I can't thank you enough. Thank you. I made it. You made it, girl. I'm very proud of you. The second cesarean was a cesarean, because the first one had been a cesarean. The third one, because the other ones were cesareans. What if I have seven kids? What if I have ten? What if I have 12 kids? Are you saying that it's safer to have 12 cesareans than trying a normal delivery? There was no response, he remained silent. It's going to be about 100 years since that myth appeared. There was a researcher in the U.S. who once said: "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean." First because the technique of the cesarean was vertical, and there really was a higher risk of a uterine rupture, but he said that to avoid that the first cesarean was made. They distorted everything and used it to keep doing the other cesareans. You can have a vaginal birth after a cesarean. I'm here to say, I know some may not have achieved it... VBAC VAGINAL BIRTH AFTER CESAREAN We can't look for zero risk, because it doesn't exist. One option and the other option. Both have risks and they have benefits. The great risk of a normal delivery after a cesarean, the one most women fear, is a uterine rupture. This occurrence is rare, the risk is less than 0.5%. You can, in that situation, look at the 0.5 or you can look at almost 100% chance that nothing happens. People ignore the risks of repeat cesareans. Because when you repeat and you make two, three, four, five, six cesareans, these new caesarean sections are risky, because the woman has a lot of adhesion, an increased risk of bleeding in this new cesarean section, of injuring an organ, like the bladder, the intestine, of needing a hysterectomy, a blood transfusion or even dying. A woman who knows absolutely nothing about the risks of a new cesarean section and says: "I prefer to repeat the cesarean." That's not autonomy. Autonomy is intimately linked to knowledge. It's 120, 130. Everything's alright, my love. You were born. We're out here, love. Love. It was easy for me to choose a home birth in my second pregnancy. And I was very clear. I didn't want a doctor. Doctors don't know how to deliver a baby. I chose a midwife. And she was born perfect, everything went well. I had my third child, who was born at home, this time a faster delivery, very fast. And now I attend only home births, because I have fought in all the hospitals in my city. And I can't get into a hospital anymore. How beautiful! Did you see, love? I love you. The moaning gets more and more animal, more intense and longer, like... Many years accompanying women... has brought me great security and also a confidence that I can manage it. Heavens, your placenta is so purple! It's very healthy, very beautiful. In a routine exam, ultrasound, we saw that the baby was dead. I waited for my body to perceive that fetal death, to eliminate spontaneously that little baby. I felt a very strong contraction, I saw that a baby had come out and I began having an hemorrhage. And then I had a hypovolemic shock. I fainted and I kept convulsing for more than ten minutes. When the paramedics arrived to my house, they didn't come to help me. The paramedic asked me how many pills of Citotec I had taken. When I arrived at the hospital, for more than 20 minutes, I was interrogated by many professionals. My husband too, in the other room. Everyone wanted to confirm what had happened and then they changed places... Until finally I was attended by a doctor who prescribed a medication, an immediate hydration. My foot made the blood overflow in my shoe. That's when I understood what was happening to me. You already fall into an accusation of induced abortion. Most likely, I was being kept there until a policeman arrived. I was the victim of a culture who judges the woman on the basis of these events of induced abortion and I didn't provoke my abortion. From 20 to 25% of pregnancies end in fetal death. A quarter of women can live what I have lived. And they can die from that. If you can put in this e-mail the points that you intend to address in this interview it would help me to see who can address them. First, you talk to our secretary, they ask for our authorization, and we ask the director to authorize it. We have a lot of surgeries, procedures, consultations, so the schedule is very complicated. Many health professionals... live what you call the Burnout Syndrome... which is a disease of the soul... and sometimes the body. Pressed by productivity, by the excess of patients to be served with a low structure, he wears out and it erodes his soul at the most fundamental point of identity of the health professional, which is empathy. And he deepens that bitterness and becomes a more rigid, cold, impatient person and, therefore, more violent. Let the professionals speak of the hardness of working with death, of receiving death when life is expected. This causes an impact and you don't have time to digest this, we have to get out of that scene and quickly run down the hall to the next room, the next attention. As if nothing had happened. And the way he has to deal with this rush, with this dehumanization of himself, is to shield himself, to incarcerate himself. Before the third quarter, we already start to accompany that pregnant woman, to know who she is, who that family is. I've had two beautiful experiences. Humanized delivery, for those who don't have the conditions to pay, the Angela House provides it to us. When she came to my arms, heavens! More than 40 minutes she kept drooling and her look was on me. I did all the prenatal here. And at the time of birth here, the welcome, every procedure we went through here so that he was born... Better than we dreamed, it was very exciting. They gave us a lot of tranquility. "Everything is fine. Whatever you prefer, feel comfortable." He slept very well. Yesterday he bathed too, right? Yes, it was the first bath. After he wakes up... feed him and we can also give him a bath. This is a space where you can walk during labor and sometimes after childbirth with the baby, we can give him a sunbath, if it's not as cold as today. We don't need to put a lot of water, because with your baby's weight the water goes up... then always just a little more than half. The most important thing here is that you hold his head. Some hold it different too, lower. The uterus on the outside. A warm place. -Cozy... -It's very comfortable. So, every time he's a little stressed, when you feel his belly hurts... -It's a little ofuro. -It's an ofuro, exactly. It's a relaxing bath. Sometimes they even sleep. How adorable. -Alright? -It's perfect. My baby. Hello, Leona. Hi, pretty. SCENES OF THE FILM ORGASMIC BIRTH Where it comes from is very... impossible to answer. -Depends on creativity. -But I think that... I think the first sign that it's an obstetric myth is the weirdness. But how? Myopia and normal delivery? What does it have to do? It can be a doctor who knows her since she was a teenager, it can be the one that made her mother's delivery. If you call the health plan and you see that he has a rate of 80%, maybe 90%, or incredibly 100%! There are doctors with 100% of cesarean rate. She won't have a normal delivery. The first son, I had him at 35. So, I was an old pregnant woman. The second one I had with 38... and a third came with 43. Again the pressure went up. Preeclampsia, despite being something serious, is not indicative of a cesarean as many people think. Absolute indication of cesarean section: I have active genital herpes during labor, early placenta... If the placenta is born before, it takes off and the baby stays inside without nutrients and oxygen. -He will go into suffering. -And the mother too. TRANSVERSE BABY The transverse baby is the baby that is across the uterus. One of the extremities has to be down to be born, right? By gravity. But that is not an indication to schedule a cesarean section. The woman can go into labor, which can evolve and then she may have a cesarean section, which is better for the baby. Prolapse of cord is a very feared emergency. CORD PROLAPSE It can occur during the entire pregnancy as long as the water breaks and the cord was in front of the head. The idea that women know how to give birth and babies know how to be born is frankly violent. When you take the statistics that 15% of women have dystocias in their births. Didn't these women know how to give birth? Didn't these babies know how to be born? This is a burden of guilt over women that doesn't fit in the movement of humanization of childbirth. Many who know and study have dystocia in the same way, then it doesn't depend on knowing. There are women who don't believe that they will connect with nature, with the sacred feminine. Some people don't have religion or aren't mystical. The midwife doesn't deliver.

Hold his head to remove that secretion. Wait... Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you, blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you... For us, that which was a theory became a practical thing with Thomas. -He's healthy, he is... -Cheerful. Cheerful, he breastfeeds, he has a very strong immunity and it's milk, look, I'll tell you... -all the time. -All the time. And all the time with much pleasure, so it's not a sacrifice. It's an absolute pleasure. Of course he breastfeeds every night. It's tiring, but when I turn around and I see him asleep, with his mouth closed, breathing through the nose, quiet, fully developed in all senses, breathing, speaking, walking, his balance, the muscular strength that he has, and they ask me "How long will you breastfeed? One year and four months breastfeeding." For as long as he wants, whenever he wants, all the time. He's like Sergio in everything, identical. -Yes. -Besides, he's really cute, you know? That's me. True. In my ICU, there is more or less from 30 to 40 children. There are more children in the ICU than in the nursery. If you're in the nursery, you'll see eight, nine babies. In the ICU, it's crowded. And there's a lot of children. Most children go to the ICU to spend at least 24 hours, because in most cases, they are born purple, without air. Oxygen saturation of the baby in the womb is lower than ours out here, right? Then everyone is born purple. Here they are angels, right? The medical team are the angels who are here to strengthen to our kids. So, I always tell the nurses... It's God in heaven and them on Earth. If they weren't on earth, our children wouldn't be here so we could tell this great story. As I said, when he was born, his foot was as big as my thumb. We took some photos but... You can't see because of the reflection. But if you want, I can send them. So strong! Baby. Baby. Do you want to see mom? It's a feeling of loneliness. Loneliness. It's a word that... when I remember everything that I lived. I had plans to have two children. I said: "I don't want to go through that ever again." I had given up. And I only had my second son because I saw the promotional video of the first movie, The Renaissance of Childbirth. That video gave me hope... because I knew there was another way to bring our children to the world. Girl! So beautiful. Love! I saw the Renaissance of Childbirth... in the cinema in August and in October I was pregnant. And then my second son... it was completely different, completely different. I managed to have my son vaginally... and I feel like having one more. If it wasn't your willpower, you wouldn't have gotten here. -Thank you. -You know that, don't you? I did everything, I gave my best. Right, son? My love. Look, you're tiny. Come, dad, dad is here too. Your little brother is also here waiting. Now it's just lying down and sleeping. Look at your baby. Daughter! When we share stories, we change our own. Because every time we tell our story, we change the way we see the world. Empowerment is not an external variable, it's internal. It's the woman who discovers the power, nobody gives her the protagonism. His eye, it's stuck because it has so much vernix! Very good!
