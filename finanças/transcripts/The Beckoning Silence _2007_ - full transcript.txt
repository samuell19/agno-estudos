(wind howling) (Joe panting) - I knew people died in mountains long before I had my accident. (wind howling) (Joe panting) I sort of understood you were playing a game for very high stakes, and you might not actually have a choice over your fate. (ice cracking) (wind howling) You'd like to think you control the odds by your judgment and by your skill, and that's not exactly true. (wind howling) (Joe panting) - [Steven] The climber, Joe Simpson, was 25 when he had an accident that nearly killed him. (ice crashing) (intense music) He wrote a book, "Touching the Void", about his extraordinary battle to survive. (intense music) Now, he is going back to the mountain that first inspired him to climb, to tell a story that has haunted him since he was a boy. (intense music) It is the tale of a great adventure, that just like his, turned into a terrifying test of endurance. (intense music) - [Joe] When I was 14, I read the story that stayed with me for the rest of my life. It was the story of Toni Kurz. (intense music) It says so many things about friendship, courage, and strength, and human spirit. (intense music) It inspired me to climb. (intense music) In many ways, it's my story. (intense music) We thought it was worth risking everything. (intense music) (wind howling) And we did. (intense music) (wind howling) (traffic droning) (sirens ringing) I've spent my life climbing mountains. (train droning) (intense music) Climbed difficult mountains, climbed easy mountains. (train droning) (intense music) And I've climbed all over the world. (train droning) (intense music) But my dream is always to climb the Eiger. (train droning) (intense music) - [Steven] Of all the summits in the Alps, the Eiger is the mountain that is a legend among climbers. (train droning) (intense music) It has fascinated Joe Simpson for as long as he can remember. (train droning) (intense music) - It is not the greatest mountain in the world. It is not the most beautiful mountain in the world, and the climbing on it is not the hardest, but to me, anyway, and I think to many others of our generation, it's a seminal mountain. (train droning) (intense music) And it has a sort of hypnotic power about it, it has an atmosphere, something truly intimidating. (intense music) This brooding presence. (intense music) The first time you see it, you just look up and up. And you just thing, "Good God." (wind howling) - [Steven] From the east, west and south, the Eiger looks like any other mountain. (wind howling) (intense music) It is it's north face that makes it a legend. (wind howling) (intense music) A 6,000 foot vertical wall of rock and ice, it is a place that never gets the sun. And standing exposed to every storm sweeping into the Alps, it is a mountain where the weather can change with breathtaking speed. - [Joe] I've seen it happen. I've seen the face turn into a maelstrom of rockfall and avalanches, the like of which I've never witnessed on any mountain in my life. (wind howling) (placid music) There's something else extraordinary about it, that almost heightens the sense of danger. (wind howling) (placid music) You are so close to luxurious hotels, to people having fun, you could hear the excited chatter of tourists getting on and off the trains and drinking their beers. You can see them and they can see you. (wind howling) (placid music) - [Steven] More than 60 men have died on the north face of the Eiger. (placid music) It has killed some of the best young climbers of their generation, and forced some of the most dramatic mountain rescues in the Alps. (placid music) And it was this bleak history that caught Joe's imagination as a boy. (placid music) - My father gave me a book called "The White Spider". It was fascinating and it was frightening. (placid music) And it was those stories, and one story in particular, the story of Toni Kurz, that made me want to climb. (placid music) There's a picture of Kurz sitting in meadow in the summer of 1936. (placid music) This smiling young man looking at you from the past and he was just a vibrant, energetic, ambitious young climber. It was just absolute excitement, it's what he lived for. (placid music) - [Steven] But this is not just a story that inspired Joe to climb. (placid music) 11 years after reading of what happened to Kurz on the Eiger, Joe had a climbing accident in Peru that nearly killed him. (intense music) And what has haunted him ever since is that in strange and disturbing ways, his accident echoed the story of his childhood hero. (wind howling) - [Joe] Kurz was always there. Kurz was always this figure. (wind howling) But what happened to me in Peru led me back to him. (wind howling) (intense music) (gear rattling) (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) - [Steven] Toni Kurz set out to climb the north face of the Eiger on the 20th of July, 1936. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) He and his fellow climbers were only the second team in its history to attempt it. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) Kurz was 23, a newly qualified mountain guide from Bavaria. (placid music) (gear rattling) He was climbing with his friend and fellow guide, a brilliant young rock climber called Andreas Hinterstoisser. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) They had joined up on the climb with two Austrians. 27 year old Willy Angerer was the eldest. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) His partner, Edi Rainer, was the most experienced, a highly talented route finder and mountaineer. (placid music) (gear rattling) (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) Their progress up the north face that day had turned into a public event. (placid music) (wind howling) They were being watched from the valley below by a cluster of reporters and tourists. (placid music) (wind howling) One by one, in the early 1930s, the great north faces of the Alps had been claimed, but the Eiger was still unconquered. (placid music) (wind howling) It was so difficult, so dangerous, that one climber called it an obsession for the mentally deranged. (placid music) (wind howling) - As you approach the bottom part of the face, you climb the sheers of shattered rock walls and rubble strewn ledgers. Then you get under the Rote Fluh. It's a tiny feature on this face, and yet, it's 1,000 feet high, an overhanging wall of rock. Then around the corner to the edge of the first field. (placid music) The second ice field is this great swath of ice, 1,800 feet wide, it's steep, it's getting steeper. And every time from now on that you get onto rock, it's getting steeper and steeper. Until you get right to the base of the great ice shoot, called the White Spider. If you fell at this point, you would zip out into space. You probably wouldn't touch anything for 5,000 feet. (placid music) - [Steven] It was the scale of this vertical rock face that defeated the first climbers to attempt it. (placid music) Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer set of in the summer of the previous year. (placid music) Three days into their climb, a storm hit the face. The men were seen trying to climb up and out to safety. But on the fifth day, they disappeared. Sedlmeyer's body was found frozen into the ice at a place now called Death Bivouac. (placid music) It was a very controversial tragedy. (placid music) Climbers had died on many mountains in the Alps, but not in full view of the public. (placid music) The north face was called a suicidal challenge. There was talk of banning it to climbers. But the following summer, Kurz and his friends arrived, ambitious young climbers chasing a great first ascent. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) - They wanted to do it for the same reason we did, to see if it was possible. You don't feel like you ever have to justify yourself to anybody else. You go and do these things and if other people think you're stupid or irresponsible, you don't give a damn. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) And I suppose as a young boy, I just thought, "God, what an extraordinary thing to do." Not just a brave thing to do, an extraordinary thing to do. To look at a face like that and just think, "I'm good enough. "I will climb this, I will succeed." (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) (wind howling) (placid music) - [Steven] But there was a reason people said the north face was impossible. Confidence and optimism do not protect you on this mountain. And what happened to these four young climbers over the next five days proved beyond doubt that the Eiger was every bit as frightening as its reputation suggested. (placid music) (wind howling) (snow thundering) The risk of an unexpected avalanche is always present in the Alps. (snow thundering) Unstable ice and snow, the threat of sudden storms are what make these mountains dangerous. (snow thundering) Joe has been waiting for days for a weather window to climb on the Eiger. Local mountain guides advised that heavy snowfall and the unpredictable weather made it too great a risk for him and his climbing partner, Cubby. - [Man] In the summer, you have sun in the top of the ramp. - [Steven] The Eiger is a mountain Joe has dreamt of climbing all his life. But bad luck and bad injuries have intervened each time. (placid music) - This mountain, it's quite addictive. But it will blow off, won't it? (placid music) I've made six attempts on the face, then got bad weather every single time. (placid music) But it calls you. I sort of had this phrase, the beckoning silence of great height. And what I was meaning by that was this, when you stand on the edge of a great drop, it's very difficult not to be absolutely staggered by it. When you look at a face like that and you're most near, you just want to go up there and play games on it. (wind howling) - [Steven] Joe is here to retrace key sections of the route that Toni Kurz and his friends took up the north face in the summer of 1936. (train droning) (wind howling) He will do the climb in stages, and for the first, he has an easy shortcut to a point, a third of the way up the face. (train droning) Because the Eiger has one other unusual feature. (train droning) In the late 19th century, the Swiss government built a railway tunnel right up the middle of the mountain. (train droning) Half way up the track, a small access window was drilled through the mountain wall. It opens directly onto the north face of the Eiger. (train droning) - There's such psychological baggage that it brings with it, this face. All the stories that you've heard, all the possible ways you can get hurt or trapped or killed. And you can't get those out your head. (intense music) (wind howling) (gear rattling) It's quite a surreal sensation, starting a climb like this. It's not often that you climb out a nice, warm train. (wind howling) And then just suddenly step out of a tunnel. (wind howling) And you're just 1,500 feet up the north face of the Eiger. (wind howling) When you're suddenly exposed to an abyss like that, it's impossible not to be aware of the sense of the drop. (Joe panting) The sense of the fall line below you. And it's quite a strange game it plays on you because this drop isn't actually doing you any harm at all. It's just there. (Joe panting) But it gets in your head. (Joe panting) (placid music) About same time I started reading the story of Toni Kurz, I started rock climbing. (placid music) It was just like that's what I've been looking for. And I found that, although it was a bit frightening, if you knew what you were doing, you could get rid of the fear. (placid music) That was almost an addiction really. It always had to have that mixture of apprehension and exhilaration, fear and excitement. And then, you want to test yourself more and more. (placid music) You want to go and do a first ascent, go and climb something with the extreme ability that you have. (placid music) That's how you lived. (placid music) And I didn't really realize how obsessive I became until many years later when my mother had died, I was given a bundle of postcards that I'd sent to her 20 years or so before. And I didn't recognize my former self. So, it was this is utterly driven person who was completely obsessed. There was nothing on the cards about anything other than mountains and grades and routes, which would have meant absolutely nothing to my parents. (placid music) And it was all written in tiny letters, all around the postcard, and there was only a little square in the middle for the address. (placid music) Perhaps you have to become a little obsessive to do something to that degree. (placid music) (Joe panting) - [Steven] At a point a third of the way up the north face, the route of Toni Kurz's ambitious attempt on mountain, brings Joe within sight of a place that is notorious amongst climbers. (wind howling) At first, Kurz and his three friends made rapid progress up the face, climbing 1,500 feet on the morning of their first day. (speaking in foreign language) (eerie music) But then they were stopped in their tracks by a smooth slab of polished rock. (eerie music) (wind howling) - Toni. (eerie music) (wind howling) - [Steven] The climbers had mapped out a new route, gambling that the fastest way up the face was to follow the path of the great ice fields at its center. Their plan was to aim for the left hand corner of the vast rock wall, the Rote Fluh, and sneak across to the bottom of the first ice field. But it was at this critical point that the rock barrier blocked their path. (eerie music) (wind howling) - This section here, it's only about 15 feet maximum. It's incredibly smooth. You can just see by all the crampon scratches all over it, people have had trouble here. (wind howling) It's a quite a wake up drop below, it's mine. Probably about 2,000 feet straight down. (wind howling) And up here is a very old peg. (wind howling) (eerie music) I reckon what Hinterstoisser is he climbed up these ledges, put that peg in and clipped his rope in it. - [Andreas] Okay. - With the advantage of the rope above Him, he could sort of do a downward traverse across these very smooth slabs, being given tension by his companions. - [Andreas] Okay. (gear rattling) (intense music) - [Joe] Hinterstoisser knew he was the best rock climber there, he was the only one who could do this. (intense music) But if he falls off, he's gonna take a huge swing and be hanging underneath. (rock grinding) (gear rattling) (Andreas panting) (intense music) - [Steven] Edging sideways and a step by step traverse across this near vertical rock is still so difficult and dangerous that climbers today always leave a fixed rope in place. (intense music) (gear rattling) But Hinterstoisser was climbing rock no one had touched before. And he was climbing into the unknown. He had no way of telling what lay out of sight around the corner. (gear rattling) (wind howling) (shouting in foreign language) (gear rattling) (wind howling) - Toni, (shouts in foreign language)! (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) (gear rattling) - [Steven] It was virtuoso a piece of climbing. (placid music) Crossing this 100 foot stretch of rock had unlocked the heart of the face. (placid music) With the security of the rope in place, his friends could cross one by one. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) And all of them knew it was possible that nothing as difficult as this lay between them and the summit. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) - [Joe] They set off on a great adventure. (placid music) They believed in themselves, and they proved to their own brilliance that they were capable of doing this. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) - That's what I loved about climbing. It's about having fun. It's about living to the full. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) I look at Kurz, and it's almost like seeing back to when you were 20 years old. (placid music) (wind howling) We thought it was worth risking everything, all of the rest of your life, every happiness you ever could have had, and all the expenses you have in all the countries and on all the mountains, they change who you are and they mold who you are, and they become, it becomes something that's life enhancing and life defining. (placid music) - [Steven] The dream of a first ascent on the north face was now in sight. (wind howling) (speaking in foreign language) But in their relation that morning, there was one thing the four climbers didn't know. Without a rope fixed in place, it is impossible to climb back across the traverse. (eerie music) (gear rattling) - What they were thinking about was the way ahead. They intended to climb to the summit. (eerie music) And as they pulled the roped back, it didn't for one moment enter their minds that they might have to try and come back this way. (intense music) (wind howling) - [Steven] 3,000 feet up the north face of the Eiger, the terrain changes. (intense music) (wind howling) A massive ice field extends across the width of the rock face at the halfway point of the climb. And with it comes a new danger. (wind howling) Because beyond the sheer scale of the face and the potential to get trapped by bad weather, there's another menace always present on this mountain. (wind howling) (gear rattling) (ice shattering) (men panting) In late afternoon, when the sun hits the edge of the face, the ice begins to melt. (wind howling) Thousands of loose rocks frozen into the ice field over the years, start to work loose. And when they fall, they come down with incredible speed. (intense music) (ice shattering) (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) - You look up, thrum, thrum, thrum, vzz. Vzz, vzz, vzz. (rocks crashing) (intense music) Suddenly the size of half a brick is falling 500 feet through the air, shooting past you. (rocks crashing) (intense music) It hits with extraordinary velocity. It won't just break your arm. It'll will shatter the bone. (ice shattering) (speaking in foreign language) (rocks crashing) (speaking in foreign language) - [Steven] The climbers had no helmets. (rocks crashing) (speaking in foreign language) Just simple felt hats. (rocks crashing) (speaking in foreign language) But one by one that afternoon, Toni Kurz and his friends took their turn to make the 300 foot dash up the first ice field. (rocks crashing) (speaking in foreign language) (wind howling) (intense music) - [Toni] Willy! - [Steven] Willy Angerer was the third to go. (rocks crashing) (gear rattling) (speaking in foreign language) (rocks crashing) - There was just a volley of stones that just doof, doof, doof, doof, came all around them. And none of them were hit, and then, doof, Angerer was hit. (rocks crashing) (intense music) In that one instance and that sickening sound of somebody being smashed on the head by a stone, everything would have been suspended for a sec. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) It only takes one slip, one false move, one single stone to come out of nowhere and it becomes a completely different game that you're playing. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) - [Steven] The climbers were more than halfway to the summit of the Eiger. That morning, a great first ascent had seemed within their grasp. (speaking in foreign language) (wind howling) But now Willy Angerer had some kind of head injury, and the four friends faced the hardest of choices, whether to push onto the top. (wind howling) (speaking in foreign language) Or turn back to safety. (eerie music) (wind howling) (intense music) (wind howling) After the shock of Angerer's accident, the four climbers roped themselves to ledge on the Eiger, and rested for night. (intense music) (wind howling) The next morning, witnesses saw them leave camp at 7:00 a.m. (intense music) (chattering) Everyone expected them to start down. (intense music) (wind howling) But instead, they began to climb again. (intense music) (wind howling) They were halfway up a mountain no one had climbed before. And that was a prize they would not give up lightly. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) (wind howling) The men had reached the point where the 1,800 foot wide expanse of the second ice field stretches out across the north face. (intense music) (chopper droning) The ice field is 3,000 vertical feet above the valley. (intense music) (chopper droning) But the skills of the local air rescue team mean Joe can be dropped onto the ice field by a helicopter. (intense music) (chopper droning) The pilot will fly close enough to the mountain to winch him down to a ledge that is barely two feet wide. (intense music) (chopper droning) At this point, Joe will be able to retrace Kurz's progress on the second day of his climb. (chopper droning) (wind howling) (gear rattling) - They must have felt pretty good when they got here. (wind howling) (gear rattling) All the main features the face are now apparent. You can see the ramp, half of the second ice field. They know from here they should have no problem getting to Sedlmayer and Mehringer's high spot of the year before to Death Bivouac. (wind howling) (Joe panting) - [Steven] The second ice field is an exposed and dangerous place. (intense music) (ice crunching) Hinterstoisser and Kurz knew it was ground they needed to cover as fast as possible. (intense music) (gear rattling) But as the morning wore on, it became clear they had a problem. (intense music) (gear rattling) The injured Willie Angerer was getting slower by the hour. (intense music) (gear rattling) - Inside they would be thinking, get a move on. Get a move on. (intense music) (gear rattling) And by the same degree, Angerer would've know that he's not moving fast enough. (intense music) (gear rattling) It's like you're trying to get to the most important meeting in your life and you're stuck in a traffic jam in the worst possible place. (intense music) (wind howling) They still had half the height of the face to go. 3,000 feet above them. That's vertical height, they probably had about 8,000 feet in total distance to climb. (intense music) (wind howling) - [Steven] The four men would have expected to cross the second ice field in five or six hours. (intense music) (wind howling) But by the end of the day, they were still making their slow traverse across it. (intense music) (wind howling) That evening, they made another camp on the ice. (intense music) (wind howling) (speaking in foreign language) Each of them knew the dangers of moving too slowly on this mountain. The risk of getting trapped by bad weather. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) It was what had killed the first two climbers to attempt it. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) - I could imagine what it must have felt like to be Kurz or Hinterstoisser, the uninjured pair. (gear rattling) (intense music) I would have been thinking, this isn't gonna work. We cannot climb this at this speed. We probably have the hardest climbing ahead of us. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) And maybe in some whispered conversation with my partner, I'd say, "Look, do you think those two "can get down on their own? "Because we can go on as a pair." (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) And I think Angerer and Rainer couldn't fail to have been aware that things have changed. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) You have to add something else into this. (intense music) (rocks crashing) This is where Sedlmayer and Mehringer had died the year before. (intense music) (rocks crashing) Sedlmayer was frozen into the snow, probably less than a rope length from where they were sitting that night. (intense music) (wind howling) You'd like to think, as a young man, you control the odds, by your judgment and by your skill, and that sort of gives you your sense of invulnerability. And it's not exactly true. (eerie music) - [Steven] Joe was just two years older than Kurz when something happened that changed his life. (eerie music) He was 25, climbing in Peru when he broke his leg in a split second fall. (eerie music) His climbing partner, Simon, tried to lower him down the mountain. But in the darkness, Joe slid over the edge of an ice cliff. (eerie music) And he was trapped hanging in space above a precipice. (eerie music) To save himself, Simon was forced to cut the rope. (eerie music) Joe fell 150 feet into a crevasse. (eerie music) Then for four days, he crawled to safety with a badly shattered leg. (eerie music) - When I got back to England, I had six operations on my knee. I was in plaster for nine months. I was on crutches for 12 months. (placid music) (train rattling) And as I was discharged, the consultant told me, "You'll never walk without a limb." (placid music) (train rattling) "And you'll never climb again." (placid music) (train rattling) I don't think he really understood what he was saying to me. (placid music) Climbing was my whole life. (placid music) It was a passion. (placid music) And I remember sitting on the bed, looking at my legs, and just crying because this guy was telling me it was over. (placid music) So, I'd go down to the local swimming pool and just swim and swim. (placid music) Eventually, I got to a point where I was going five days a week, and I started getting fitter and fitter and fitter. (placid music) It was a long, hard rehabilitation. (placid music) But it was enough, in the end, to start climbing again. (placid music) I should have been pretty much set up and happy, and I wasn't really. (placid music) Something changed. (placid music) Something inside has been damaged. (placid music) (wind howling) - [Steven] On the morning of July the 20th, 1936, witnesses in the valley saw something odd happen among the four climbers. (chattering) As they left their camp on the ice, two of them pushed ahead, climbing fast towards the summit. (intense music) (ice crunching) It was Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz. (intense music) (ice crunching) - These two wanted to do the climb. They could actually see the path ahead to the summit. (intense music) (wind howling) They know that Angerer is injured, but they would have been hoping that if they just a bullish, aggressive, go for it, come on, lads, do it, they'll come with them. (intense music) (gear rattling) (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) And then they were stopped dead in their tracks. (Willy panting) (wind howling) It would have become apparent, as soon as they started climbing, that Angerer wasn't as well as they thought. (intense music) (gear rattling) God, the disappointment, shit, damn, damn. We could have climbed it, we could have climbed it. (wind howling) The dream had gone. (wind howling) (gear rattling) And then, everything changed. The task they had now is to save another man. (intense music) - [Steven] To retreat now meant reversing their tracks 1,800 feet across the second ice field, then 3,000 feet down to the safety of the valley below. (intense music) (wind howling) But this time, they had an injured man who was clearly deteriorating. (intense music) (wind howling) They began the descent at midday. (intense music) (wind howling) It took the most of the afternoon to make their way back across the second ice field. (intense music) (wind howling) To make matters worse, in the valley below were the first telltale signs of bad weather approaching. (intense music) (wind howling) (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) - It was as if they want were on balance of excitement and adventure and anticipation on the one side and tipping in to losing control and failure. And it's at that point that everything tipped. (intense music) (wind howling) (fire whooshing) (placid music) - [Steven] At 8:30 that night, the climbers stopped to rest. It was their third night on the north face, and they were back at the halfway point of the climb. (fire whooshing) (placid music) The following day, their retreat would bring them to the 100 foot rock barrier, the traverse. (fire whooshing) (placid music) - [Joe] Hinterstoisser of all people knew how difficult it had been to climb across the traverse, he'd done it in dry conditions. (fire whooshing) (placid music) And I'm sure it must have been going through his mind. We've got 3,000 feet to descent, but we've got one crux thing. First, we have to get back across the traverse. (wind howling) (placid music) (thunder droning) (wind howling) - [Steven] By the morning of the fourth day, the mountain was enveloped in cloud. (gear rattling) The temperature was dropping, and water was beginning to pour down the face, freezing in places to the rock around them. (intense music) (gear rattling) The men left the bivouac around 7:00 a.m, but Angerer's condition appear to be worsening. (intense music) (gear rattling) Their descent of the first ice field that morning was painfully slow. (intense music) (gear rattling) The seriousness of their position would now have struck all of them. (intense music) They couldn't climb up to safety, and they couldn't climb down. below them was a 700 foot abyss. They knew if they couldn't get back across the traverse, they were trapped. (intense music) What they didn't know was what Hinterstoisser had done the first time wasn't possible in reverse. (intense music) (Joe panting) - This is about plum center of the Hinterstoisser. To come across, Hinterstoisser put the high peg in and clipped his rope in it. And so, he had his rope running down to him under tension. And he could have lent with his friends, tensioning him across, across this blank bit. And then, they'd pull the ropes back. To come back, he couldn't get any tension. He didn't have any high pitons above us. And you can just see this section here. 15, 20 feet is absolutely ice worn smooth, there aren't downward facing ledges, which are tricky enough in these conditions. (wind howling) (rocks crashing) But if this was ice glazed, it would have been absolutely desperate. (wind howling) (rocks crashing) (intense music) - [Steven] And it was. (intense music) The glass smooth rock of the traverse was now wet. (speaking in foreign language) And streaked with black ice. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) (Andreas grunting) (intense music) - Everything would have compressed into the small movement to time. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) Every fiber in his body would be concentrating on every tiny move. (intense music) (rock grinding) This is their best climber, trying for all he was worth to get back across the very thing that he brilliantly unlocked. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) He spent almost five hours trying to cross this travers. (intense music) (Andreas yelling) (gear rattling) (intense music) I reckon virtually where I'm standing now is where Hinterstoisser would have repeatedly fallen off, desperately just trying to climb this section. (speaking in foreign language) (wind howling) There is that moment when activity stops. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) You just know you can't do this. (intense music) And you have to accept that it's over. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) And it would have gradually been dawning on all of them that this could be a fatal error that they hadn't left a rope across. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) They couldn't cross the traverse, it was unclothed. (speaking in foreign language) (intense music) But if they stayed where they were, they were going to die. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) The very piece of brilliance that had unlocked the heart of the face had trapped them. (intense music) (wind howling) As a storm comes into the face, you can sense it as much as see it. (thunder droning) (wind howling) There's this horrible sense of expectancy, the hair on the back of the head starts to rise and you become incredibly aware that it's about to happen, it's about happen. (thunder droning) (wind howling) And then, all hell is let loose. (wind screeching) - [Steven] The storm hit the Eiger on the climbers' fourth day on the north face. For the watches in the valley, it was an unsettling reminder of the previous year. (chattering) Just like the first two climbers to attempt it, Kurz and the others had simply disappeared behind the cloud. (wind howling) Trapped halfway up the mountain, the climbers now knew they couldn't climb up to safety or back across the traverse. It would gradually have dawned on all of them that there was only one option left, to descend the vertical ground below them. (wind howling) (intense music) - I imagine they don't even wanna contemplating it. (intense music) They were still 3,000 feet above the valley. (intense music) They stay where they are, Angerer will certainly die, but they're not gonna survive in these conditions much longer. Another night on the face, exhausted, they're not gonna last. Below them, they have ground dropping away steeply, ice covered rocks getting steeper and steeper until eventually they knew there was a rock barrier some 200 feet high, vertical and overhanging. If they get down and it's a big earth, there is a ledge system that runs across the face. (intense music) - [Steven] This ledge system led to a small door drilled through the mountain wall into the railway tunnel. It was the same door that Joe used as a shortcut onto the face. (intense music) (wind howling) - Everything that's been happening since that day is limiting their options. (intense music) (wind howling) They had a barely conscious man to try and bring down. (intense music) (wind howling) And to make matters worse, their line of descent led them directly to the stones and the avalanches that were hurtling down from above. (placid music) (wind howling) To step out into the face of those avalanches would have seemed suicidal. (placid music) (wind howling) But there's no other choice. (placid music) (wind howling) This is pretty much their abseil line of descent. (placid music) (wind howling) This really would have been an awful place to start trying to get down. (intense music) (wind howling) I've got good visibility today. And I wouldn't like to be going down here. (intense music) (wind howling) In the teeth of a storm, they wouldn't be able to see very far at all. (intense music) (wind howling) And they would have had to contend with lowering somebody, who was probably barely capable of looking after himself, going in and out of consciousness. (intense music) (wind howling) And then you have to think of their gear. Have ropes frozen into wires, clothing that's been wet for the last three to four days, they're cold, tired. (intense music) (wind howling) It would have been a very serious situation indeed. (intense music) (wind howling) (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) They heard this voice. (wind howling) And they just looked at each other, and they know what it is. (wind howling) (shouting in foreign language) - [Steven] A railway guard had gone down to the tunnel door they were trying to reach. And he was calling out to them in the storm. (wind howling) (shouting in foreign language) - And they just shouted back, "All is well," which is classic when you think about it. (placid music) (wind howling) Absolutely no mention of the fact they've got a badly injured companion, no mention of how exhausted and how tired they are and the danger they're in. That's a sort of pride, really. They will come down together. (placid music) (wind howling) They do not need help. (placid music) (wind howling) But more than anything, their spirits would have just raised at that point, there was someone else there. (placid music) (wind howling) I just have to do four abseils, possibly five. (placid music) (wind howling) I'll be having a cup of tea with the guard in two hours. (placid music) (wind howling) It was over. (intense music) (wind howling) - [Steven] As Joe is filming on the Eiger, the weather window starts to close. (wind howling) (intense music) A forecast comes through for heavy snow. (intense music) (chopper droning) The helicopter must take Joe off before the cloud cover descends. (intense music) (chopper droning) From the narrow ledge on the face, he will have to clip back on to the winch line that is just five millimeters thick. (intense music) (chopper droning) But it's so thin because if the climber becomes entangled, the pilot will be forced to cut the line. (intense music) (chopper droning) - [Joe] You walk right on the edge of things in the mountains. (intense music) (wind howling) And there's a very fine line between success and disaster, between life and death. (intense music) (chopper droning) (intense music) (men panting) And walking on the edge of that gives you a completely different perspective on life and your sense of being alive. And even when you're climbing and the conditions are great and everything's going swimmingly, you always have that little part in the back of your mind, that's just saying, just watch out, watch out, watch out. It can go wrong in an instant. (gear rattling) (intense music) - [Steven] At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, Andreas Hinterstoisser unclipped from the rope that linked the four climbers and began to prepare their final abseil. (men panting) They were barely only 200 feet from safety. (snow droning) (wind howling) (hammer thumping) (snow droning) (shouting in foreign language) (snow droning) - [Joe] The violence of it, the shock of it must have been immense, a massive avalanche just caught them like a tsunami. (intense music) (wind howling) (snow droning) It just blasted Angerer and Kurz straight off the ledge and out at the abyss below. (rope creaking) (Willy crashing) The impact of these two yanked Rainer up against the piton. (intense music) - [Toni] Hey, Willy! Willy! - [Steven] Below Kurz, Willy Angerer was almost certainly dead. - [Toni] Willy! - [Steven] Killed on impact with the rock face. And out of sight above him. - Edi! - [Steven] Edi Rainer was dying too. (placid music) - Edi! - [Steven] The weight of the two climbers on the rope around his waist would have crushed his diaphragm and slowly asphyxiated him. (placid music) (Eduard heavily breathing) It would have taken him 10 minutes to die. (placid music) There was no sign of Andreas Hinterstoisser. His body was later discovered at the foot of the north face, 2,000 feet below. (wind howling) (placid music) - Kurz was just hanging in space. (wind howling) (placid music) His companion dead below him, and his companion dead above him. (placid music) And Hinterstoisser was gone, swept out into the void. (placid music) I've been in a situation where people have fallen to their death, close by me. (placid music) And it renders you almost incapable of doing anything. (placid music) (wind howling) You're so threatened by the immediacy of the death, you're sort of unmanned, you're physically incapable of getting over the shock of what you've just witnessed. (placid music) (rope creaking) (ice crunching) - [Steven] At 3:00 o'clock that afternoon, the railway guard from the tunnel called down to the mountain guides in the valley. (train droning) He said he'd gone out to call for the four young climbers again. But this time had heard only one voice calling back, crying desperately for help. (intense music) Within an hour, a rescue party had traveled up the tunnel to the window that led directly onto the north face. (intense music) (wind howling) They knew if they climbed the ledge system that ran across the face, it would placed them somewhere below where Kurz was trapped. (intense music) 700 feet from the window, they reached a point where they could hear his cries. (intense music) But Kurz was out of sight 150 feet above them. (intense music) (wind howling) To reach him, they would have to climb a series of vertical and overhang cliffs in what were now gale force winds. (wind howling) - [Man] Toni, Toni! (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) - Toni Kurz keeps imploring them, you cannot get to me from below. (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) You must climb up and you'll be able to abseil down to me. (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) But they can't do it, they can't do it in those conditions. (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) And it's getting on to darkness. (wind howling) They can't afford to be pinned out in the open in this storm, they will die too. (wind howling) (placid music) And they say it to Toni, "You have to hang on until the morning, you must hang off." (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) It must have been heartbreaking for those guides to leave him there. They probably knew that he wasn't gonna make the night. (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) They could hear his cries coming back to them. (shouting in foreign language) (wind howling) This was a man who would never have asked for rescue in his life, and he was pleading almost childlike for them not to leave him. (placid music) (wind howling) And I can remember feeling like that. (placid music) (wind howling) I hung in a very long, dark night. And I can remember just, just almost being overwhelmed by the loneliness the situation. (placid music) The sense of being abandoned. (placid music) (wind howling) And he had known as a guide that his chances of surviving that night would be slim to nil. (placid music) (wind howling) The cold takes you in a particularly insidious way. (placid music) (wind howling) As if it's creeping through you, tentacles of cold is starting to creep through you, starting to slow everything down, to turn things off inside. (placid music) (wind howling) And the thought of just sleeping is so seductive. (intense music) It would have been so easy just to let it go. (intense music) In truth, if my partner hadn't cut the rope, I would have died of cold. (placid music) So, I can imagine what he felt like hanging on that rope. (placid music) (wind howling) You are helpless like that. (placid music) (wind howling) And just incredibly alone. (placid music) (wind howling) (keyboard ticking) (wind howling) I knew people died in mountains, long before I had my accident. (keyboard ticking) I sort of understood you were playing a game for very high stakes. And you might not actually have a choice over your fate. (placid music) (keyboard ticking) But recovering from the accident in Peru, I wrote this book, "Touching the Void". In the end, I wrote it in seven weeks, and I thought if it sold 500 copies, then I would be happy. (keyboard ticking) (placid music) I discovered I had another talent. (placid music) (keyboard ticking) But the process of writing made me think too much about what we were doing, about the price some of us were paying for this. (placid music) I started thinking about the people who died. (placid music) Some were acquaintances, and some were good friends, and some were friends I never stopped thinking about, and some died in different ways, and some died in inexplicable ways. And often, when they died, the first thing you did was you asked how, not why, because you wanted to know what they did wrong. (placid music) We did something that we loved with a passion, and it was life enhancing and life defining, and yet it was killing our friends, and nearly killing us. (placid music) And I suppose when I started writing, I'd opened a Pandora's box of fears that you can never quite put the lid on. (placid music) Despite all the climbing I did, I knew that I was more exposed and more vulnerable. (placid music) And I suddenly realized my love affair with risk taking had cooled. (placid music) I didn't wanna play this game anymore. (placid music) (wind howling) (placid music) - [Steven] A summer storm on the Eiger is often followed by a cold front. (wind howling) (placid music) All the water that's been pouring down the face freezes. (wind howling) (placid music) Ice fills every ledge, crack and foothold, and glazes every surface of the rock. (wind howling) (placid music) During Kurz's fourth night on the Eiger, its vertical face had frozen solid. (placid music) (rope creaking) - [Joe] I just can't imagine how long that night must have been. (rope creaking) (placid music) What on earth Kurz did to hold on to life. (rope creaking) (placid music) He'd lost his glove and his exposed hand was now completely frostbitten. (rope creaking) (placid music) His arm was like a claw. (rope creaking) (placid music) - [Man] Toni! (gear rattling) - [Joe] And then, he would have heard the clanking of metal and the shouts of the guides as they came back along the tracks they'd made the previous night. - [Man] Toni! (placid music) - He must have thought they're guides, they're just gonna get me down, they're just gonna get me down. (intense music) - [Steven] For the second time, the rescue team made it to within 150 feet of Kurz, but the vertical cliffs above them were now sheathed in millimeter thick black ice. (intense music) (speaking in foreign language) The rescuers reported that climbing up was impossible. - Toni! - [Steven] Somehow, they had to find a way to get Kurz down. (shouting in foreign language) (intense music) But the rope he was hanging wasn't long enough to reach them. (intense music) So first, Kurz had to free himself. And then, he had to find more rope. (intense music) - They said to Toni, "The only way you can do that is cut Angerer free." (intense music) (wind howling) Angerer is hanging below him, frozen to the rock wall. (intense music) (wind howling) And he's faced with this awful predicament. (intense music) (wind howling) He has to get his knife and hack away at the frozen fibers of the rope. (intense music) (gear rattling) This is a man he's just spent the last four days living with in great intensity, he's just gonna cut him free. (gear rattling) (intense music) (rope creaking) - [Steven] But cutting away Willy Angerer was just the start. (wind howling) To make enough rope to reach the rescuers, Kurz had to climb up and cutaway Edi Rainer too. (placid music) (wind howling) (chattering) (placid music) In the valley, the drama unfolding on the north face was drawing a crowd. (chattering) (placid music) For hour after hour that day, they waited for glimpses of Kurz between the clouds. (wind howling) (placid music) It was mid morning by the time he started his slow and painful progress up the rope. (placid music) (gear rattling) - [Joe] He had to get up about five, 10 feet, and he got to a point where the rock steepened. (placid music) (gear rattling) And then he could hand over hand up the rope, using his feet on the rock, get himself up to Rainer. (placid music) - [Toni] Edi, Edi, Edi. (placid music) (wind howling) - [Steven] Kurz needed 150 feet of rope to reach the rescuers. (intense music) (hammer tapping) But even when he'd cut Edi free, he didn't have enough. (intense music) (wind howling) The only way to make more was to unravel the frozen three ply rope with his frostbitten hands. (intense music) (wind howling) - [Joe] I just think about what it was like. Just all night, stay awake, stay awake. Don't let the cold take you. They'll come for me in the morning. (placid music) And when they come for you in the morning, there's yet another impossible task set to you. And then, another one, and another one. (placid music) (wind howling) That in a way haunts me. (placid music) (wind howling) It wasn't just luck that I survived. (placid music) I made an effort. (placid music) It was all I had to do once I found a way out, is endure. (placid music) It wasn't easy, but that's all I had to do. (placid music) So, I know what strength of mind it takes to just keep death away. (placid music) (wind howling) - [Steven] It took Kurz five hours to unravel the rope and knot the pieces together. (placid music) (wind howling) But when he finished, he had a single strand that last linked him to the rescuers, just 150 feet below him. (placid music) (wind howling) - [Joe] Now, he couldn't abseil on this rope, 'cause it was only a single strand, it wasn't strong enough. But he could pull a rope up. And the guide attached pitons and a climbing rope. - Toni (shouts in foreign language). (placid music) (wind howling) - [Steven] But as Kurz began to pull up the rope, the rescuers realized it wasn't long enough. (placid music) - [Man] Toni, Toni, stop! - [Steven] So, they go to another. (placid music) And then, they joined the two ropes with a knot. (placid music) - Toni, (shouts in foreign language). (placid music) (wind howling) - And they watched this bunch of pitons and the rope gradually going up painfully slow. (placid music) (gear rattling) All he now had to do, all he had to do, was abseil down to safety. (wind howling) (placid music) - [Steven] On the afternoon of his fifth day on the Eiger, Toni Kurz began his descent towards the rescue team. He had 150 feet of broken ground and one vertical and overhanging cliff to abseil. (placid music) (wind howling) If the rescuers had calculated right, the two climbing ropes they that knotted together would be just enough to bring the weak and exhausted climber down. (placid music) (wind howling) - This is the painfully slow, inch by inch, jerking down movement of a man who is at the absolute limit of his physical strength. (placid music) (gear rattling) His hands were frost bitten, and he did what any sensible person would do. (placid music) (wind howling) He got the abseil rope, and he clipped it through his carabiner through a snap link at his waist, because he knew with his frozen hands and his frozen arm, he would have very little control. (placid music) (gear rattling) And the guides are now looking up. (placid music) They see his legs appearing over the overhang. (placid music) They are going to get him. He was almost within reaching distance. (placid music) But as he starts to come down, he sees the knot joining the two ropes. (placid music) It's about 50 feet off the ground. (placid music) And as Kurz inches down towards safety, he feels below him the knot tight against his fists. (intense music) And he knows instantly what the problem is. (gear rattling) (wind howling) The knot is jammed against the snap link. (placid music) (rope creaking) And he's now just swinging in space, out of reach of the guides. (speaking in foreign language) Off to the side from them, off to the left. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) They had traversed as far around as they could reach. (speaking in foreign language) (placid music) And then the face dropped away below them. (placid music) (rope creaking) If he'd managed to abseil down to a point that was level, they could have thrown a rope for him, pulled him across. (placid music) While he was above them, they could do nothing for him, couldn't throw a rope to him, they couldn't pull him down to them. There was nothing they could do. (placid music) And he knows if he can't get this knot through the snap link, he's finished. (yelling in foreign language) (intense music) And guides there, helplessly screaming encouragement to him, you can do it, come one, just one more effort. (placid music) (Toni screaming) (rope creaking) They could hear him mumbling unintelligibly to himself, trying to exhort himself for one last effort to force this knot through. (placid music) (rope creaking) But it wouldn't go. (placid music) (wind howling) Suddenly, he sat forward. He stopped fighting the knot. (placid music) And he said, in a clear, strong voice. (placid music) (speaking in foreign language) "I'm finished." (placid music) I suppose I look at Toni Kurz and the manner of his death, and I know that that should have been me. (placid music) That his story should have been mine. (placid music) In truth, I should have died on a rope in Peru. (placid music) (wind howling) And that will never be explainable to me, why I was allowed to live and he wasn't. (placid music) - [Steven] The rescuers who watched Kurz die, were never able to reach his body. (placid music) He was finally cut free by a team of mountain guides from Germany. (placid music) Who arrived just too late to help in the rescue. (placid music) Three days after his death, the Swiss authorities banned all climbers from the north face, but four months later, after a legal challenge, the ban was lifted. (placid music) For ambitious young climbers, another public tragedy had only added to the legend of the Eiger. (placid music) Toni Kurz and his fellow climbers, Edi Rainer and Willy Angerer, had watched as Andreas Hinterstoisser unlocked the heart of the north face. (placid music) In honor of his brilliant climb, it was called the Hinterstoisser Traverse. (placid music) And using that route, a team of German climbers made the first ascent two years later in 1938. (placid music) In all, eight climbers died trying before the last great north face of the Alps was conquered. (placid music) Of all of them, Toni Kurz proved the hardest to forget. (wind blowing) As Joe prepared to head home, he made one last climb to look across to the mountain where he died. (wind howling) - I read the story of Toni Kurz at 14. It stuck with me for the rest of my life. (placid music) (wind howling) That to me just seems the most dreadful way to die. (placid music) (Joe panting) And yet, somehow, it inspired me. (placid music) Why on earth would that inspire you to climb? Well, because he never gave up. (placid music) Right to the end, he thought he could win through. (placid music) He display to me something quite extraordinary about the human spirit, the ability to just, despite anything that's happening to you, to just keep on going. (placid music) (wind howling) And he deserved to survive, he deserved to live. (placid music) The photograph I always remember is of a young, smiling, tussle haired guide, laughing at the camera with the adventure of the climb ahead of him. (placid music) And I thought, he thought that was worth living for. (placid music) I better go and try and see if I can do that. (placid music) If you were going to risk all that, not just risk the hardship and the pain, but risk your life, put everything on the line for a dream, for something that's worth nothing, that can't be proved to anybody, you just have the transient moment on a summit. When you come back down to the valley, it goes. (placid music) It is actually a completely illogical thing to do. (placid music) It's not justified by any rational terms. (placid music) That's probably why you do it. (gear rattling) (placid music) My dream is to climb the Eiger. (placid music) And it just never turned out like that. (placid music) I haven't climbed for three years. (placid music) I lost the passion to do it. (placid music) I don't have that sort of immortality of youth that it'll never happen to me, self confidence. (placid music) It's an awareness of frailty I never had when I was 20. (placid music) (train droning) But I'm not saying never, 'cause I know what am I'm like. (placid music) And coming back here to do this, the face was in perfect condition, and the meadows were like the summer, I just felt that old rush coming back. (placid music) Oh, God, you idiot. (placid music)
