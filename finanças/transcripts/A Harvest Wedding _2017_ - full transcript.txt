A HARVEST WEDDING Subrip by Pix Sync-Fixes by VaVooM - It's time. - Close the door. - Cold feet? - Torn veil. Grab my bag. Scissors? Needle and thread? Wiring. Is everything alright in there? Yes, just a moment. - Wiring. - I'm not seeing it. - Got it. - Thank you. Great. Alright, maybe some lips. Just a bit. And now, right as rain. It's beautiful. No, you're beautiful. But remember, we just fixed you, so no crying until after the kiss, ok? A wedding is a dream turned into reality built on hundreds of decisions that need to fall perfectly into place and all at the right time. And when it works it's magic. But there's a reason why 75 percent of all couples consider eloping when planning their wedding. Because making a dream come true is hard work. And that's why they call me. Love's in Bloom Events, Sarah Bloom speaking. I help couples turn their dreams into reality. I offer perspective when it can be hard to see the truth. I broaden horizons when a choice seems a little narrow. The chandeliers will fit nicely with your theme. The light will be cascading through the windows and then the stage for the band right right there. And I show what's possible. I love it. Even if there's nothing there. Because, for at least one day, I believe that everyone deserves to have their dreams come true. Well first off, all of us at Wedding Insider magazine are very impressed with your work. Thank you. And, as you know, I did speak with my editors. Yeah. But they won't be able to feature you in the next issue. It's nothing personal, they just never feature anyone from their first submission. I... I didn't know that. So don't disappear, I'm sure we'll be talking again very soon. It's, nice to meet you. It was nice meeting you, Sarah Bloom. And listen, if anything big comes up, be sure to let us know, ok? Absolutely. - Thank you, Payton. - My pleasure, Emma. How did it go? Well, they never accept anyone on their first submission. - Really? - Yeah. - I didn't know that. - Neither did I. There are other publications. Yeah, but they're not Wedding Insider magazine, you know that. I mean, we get that cover, we're gonna get calls from all around the world. That's the game changer. - We need that. - So what're you gonna do? I'm gonna do what I always do. Put my head down, keep working. Speaking of work, when is our next meeting? They should be here any minute. Good, good. And I forgot to tell you, you got a message from Scott August yesterday. Scott August. Scott August. - Do I know him? - Not really. He's the date you stood up two days ago and he wanted to let you know there wouldn't be a second. - I totally forgot. - You always forget. - Well, I was working. - Because you're always working. When are you gonna realize that it's hard to plan your own wedding when you're already married to your work? Ok, I'll keep all that in mind. Look... did you hear that? I think it's our next client. - I'll get it. - Thank you. Abby, Barbara, welcome. It's very nice to meet both of you. Tom, my fiance, is running a little late but he should be here soon. Ok. First off, thank you for meeting us on such short notice. The reason we wanted to meet so quickly is because Tom and I got engaged last Wednesday. Congratulations. You know, it's very smart of you getting a jump on the planning. It helps to minimize any unnecessary anxiety when you're on the home stretch. - But what if you're already there? - I'm sorry? What my mother means to say is Tom is doing his residency at Columbia Hospital. He's also in the army reserves and as fate would have it the day after we got engaged we found out that he was being called up at the end of the month. - Wait, this month? - This month. Which only gives us two weeks. So we're here to see if that's even possible. Well, you're right, I mean two weeks is... is not a lot of time. But I believe anything's possible. But I'd be lying if I didn't tell you there may be some difficulties. I think they should wait. Mom. You shouldn't have to risk the wedding you want. But we don't wanna wait. We wanna do it now. - I know, Abby, but... - Mom, please. Look, if I may? How many guests are we talking about here? 40, maybe 50. And I would like to keep it simple. And I have a specific list of ideas that I would like incorporated. Ok, well, first things first. I mean, considering our time frame I think we need to think about finding a venue that's still available. We've got that covered. We wanna get married at Tom's family farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts. I'm sorry, did you say Williamstown? Yes! I know, but it's beautiful and I've always dreamed of having a country wedding. No, no, no, no, no. I think that that's great, it's just that... This is kinda crazy. - I was raised in Williamstown. - Really? Do you know Tom's family? It's the Nichols' farm. Your fiance is Tom Nichols? Should my ears be burning? So sorry I'm late. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey. Hey, mom. I'm Tom Nichols. You must be Sarah. - Hi, Tom. - What've I missed? Only the fact that you two have already met. What? Tom, it's Sarah Bloom from Williamstown. Hey, Tom. - Sarah? - Yeah. It's been a long time, Tom. I'm sorry, I can't believe this. This is blowing my mind. Sarah and my brother used to... We dated. That's it. - You dated David. - The farmer? - You dated someone? - Yes. To all that. Well, I think we found our wedding planner. Excuse me? Well, how could this be any better? I mean, she knows us. She knows the town, she knows the farm. You were practically a member of our family growing up. If anybody should be planning this wedding, I think it should be you. - But what about David? - What about him? Well, he works the farm now, won't that be a problem considering the two of you were sweethearts? No. No, no. We were kids. It was such a long time ago. You don't have anything to worry about. I do understand your concern but the more important thing here is that you need someone with the skills that can pull off this wedding in two weeks time. And I'm telling you with complete certainty, Barbara, I can do that. Great. - Morning. - Morning. Ready for this? Shouldn't I be asking you that question? What, because of David? - I haven't thought about him once. - He's not on Facebook. - Yeah, I know. - I knew it! No... ok, yes. Ok. I was a little curious, I looked him up. That's not what I'm focused on here, ok? I'm focused on the fact that the King family and their real estate empire makes them New York society. If we get this wedding right it could steer a lot of big business our way, ok? So we just need to... - Keep our heads on straight. - Ok, I understand. You might wanna read this. It's Barbara's list she wants incorporated into the wedding. Yep. - There's six pages here. - Yep. Who's wedding are we planning? And she supposedly has a lead on a chef. But she doesn't wanna tell me who. She wants to keep it a surprise. Does she know how much you love surprises? I don't think so. Here we are. It's so beautiful. Yeah. No wonder Abby and Tom wanted it here. How long has it been since you've been back? A couple years. I mean, we've been doing so well and dad likes coming to the city, you know? So not much of a reason for me to come back. Speaking of your dad, is he excited we're gonna be staying with him? You could say that. - Dad, let me help you with that. - No, I got this. It's ok. There we go. So, honey, I thought you could have your old room and we put Emma in the spare bed in my office. I've cleared all my stuff out so you guys can work in there. You're sure we're not putting you out? No, no. Just 'cause you haven't been here in a while, honey, doesn't mean that it's not still your home. Remember that. So... you ready for this? I hope so. I think it's gonna take a miracle to pull off this wedding. I meant are you ready to see David again? Yeah, dad, I'll be fine. 'Cause, you know, he asks about you every time I see him in town. He does? Yeah, I saw him last week at the grocery store. He asked how you were doing. What did you tell him? Well, I told him what I think you would want me to tell him. That you're happy. - Hey. - Hey. - Ready to go? - Yeah. Hey, you just got here. I know, I just wanna go ahead and go to the farm and get the whole meet and greet thing with David out of the way. You know, do that before everybody else gets here. How long since you've been to the farm? I don't know, a long time. What, maybe since high school? Yeah, but from what I can remember it's very cute. It's got this rustic kinda charm to it. Well, I see the rustic part. It's not as quiet as I thought it would be. No. The house is cute. It's... shabby chic? Yeah, I'd say more shabby than chic. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go find David. Listen, do me a favour. Make a list of everything you see that needs to be done here. That could take hours. David Nichols? Have you seen David Nichols? David? Excuse me, have you seen David Nichols? - Right over there. - Thank you. Shut it down, guys. Take five. Well, well, well. Look who decided to come home. And look who never left. Yeah. - It's good to see you, city girl. - You too, farm boy. Did you not get the message I was coming? Yeah, I did. I'm sorry I couldn't come down and meet you but, you know, our crew's short right now, we just started fall harvest, it's pretty crazy. Yeah, and we throw a big wedding at you? - Sorry about that. - It's ok. Is it just me or is that all happening pretty fast? No, it's happening fast. But it's two weeks. We'll be out of your hair in no time. I promise. No worries. Sounds like we've both got our hands full. Yeah, I guess so. Look, I gotta get back to work. It was really good to see you. Alright, let's go, boys. What? Where are you going? - Back to work? - Yeah, but... hold on. We still have a lot of things to go over. Feel free to do anything you want on the farm. I just can't help you. I've only got five days to harvest all this corn. Sorry. I got it. I got it. Listen, David, we've gotta scout for a ceremony location tomorrow, ok? And this is your farm. I mean, I kinda need you there to tell me if we're gonna run into any problems. Sarah, I really wish that I could. I am slammed right now, so have Tom help you out. Tom's working to clear some time for a quick honeymoon before he leaves on tour. He's not gonna be here until next week. Alright, well, you know the farm. Show yourself around. Well, can we at least talk about fixing up the farm house? What do you mean? Like, when's the last time you cleaned up around here? How do you clean up a farm? David, has anybody told you that this is gonna be a high-profile wedding? No, actually. Tom told me it was gonna be very simple. Yeah, there's nothing simple about planning a wedding in two weeks. Alright, so let me get this straight. You want me to fix up the farm house, clean the farm, all while I'm in the middle of the fall harvest? I'm happy to do it myself but I'm just here to let you know that there are gonna be some changes made around here. Hold on. Hello? What? Hello? Emma, I can't hear you. Just speak up a little bit. Hold on. Shut her down! You got it. Thank you. Hey. What?! What do you mean Peyton Ellis from Wedding Insider magazine is here? Ok, I'll be right there. Thank you. Sarah. - What happened to you? - I was talking to David. I told him there were gonna be some changes made around here. - And you guys wrestled about it? - What? No. Stop! No. I just... I hiked through a field, ok? - There was corn and... what? - Nothing. I just never pictured you as a farm girl is all. - I'm not a farm girl. - Ok? Here he comes. How do I look? - Like you've been wrestling. - Fix me. Didn't I just see you yesterday? Hi. - You know my associate, Emma? - Yeah, hi, how's it going? Yeah. I was not expecting you. Kind of a big surprise. Well, when I heard the news that my new friend Sarah Bloom was heading back home to plan none other than Abby King's wedding in two weeks... My editors and I agreed this just might be your shot at the featured article, or even... - You're getting a cover story? - No. I mean, he can't promise anything but yeah, there's... there's a possibility. I just wish it wasn't this wedding. Why not? Because, dad, I have, like, two weeks to plan the biggest wedding of my entire life. Honey, you'll be great. I guess I really don't have much of a choice now, do I? You know? I pass up the opportunity I may not get another shot. But if it's not perfect I could end up in the 'what went wrong' section and just ruin my entire career. I think this is wonderful news. It's the game changer. I need some air. Hotel rooms. Hotel rooms. Lots of hotel rooms. Flowers. Barbara loves flowers. Ok. Transportation. Limos versus buses. Buses. Does anybody like buses anymore? I don't know. Maybe updated buses. Like, nice buses. Hotel rooms. Hotel rooms. Wait a minute, did I just... just say hotel rooms? - Hey. - Well, well, well. Look who it is. - What, are you stalking me? - No. I'm not stalking you. I just came out to get some air. What are you doing? I just had a little meeting with the town council. We got our farmer's market coming up. I'm one of the founders, so, you know... - Look at you. - Yeah, fancy? Yeah. You should definitely come by though, it's... it's great. - It's really something. - You know, I'd love to, I'm just, I'm kinda crazed right now. Yeah, I kinda got that idea when you took off on the phone this morning. You ok? It's just this reporter from this great magazine wants to do a feature on the wedding, so... - That's great though, right? - Yeah, no, it's great. It's just that the stakes for the wedding just went through the roof and if I don't get it perfect then it could ruin everything I've worked for but no, it's wonderful. I mean, I'm not worried about it 'cause the Sarah Bloom that I remember, she'd always find a way to get it done no matter what the challenge. So I think you're good. Hopefully I haven't changed that much. Yeah. I have faith. By the way, I've got some great news. I found this landscaper buddy of mine, he's gonna come over and do some work. Great. Is he good? Yeah, he's good enough. He's just planting some flowers around the house, right? Yeah, it might be a little more than planting some flowers around the house. Do you mind if I meet him? Yeah, if that's what you want, I can set something up. Thank you. Do you want a lift? No. No, I'm just kinda getting reacquainted. Alright. If you change your mind let me know. - I'll be your tour guide. - I'll keep that in mind. - Still the same old truck? - If something ain't broke, don't fix it. Hey there. Good morning. Can I help you? Hi. Sorry, I didn't see you there. - I hope I didn't wake you. - No, no, no. The rooster did that hours ago. Just taking a little break. You must be David. I'm Peyton Ellis. From Wedding Insider magazine. Yeah, you're the reporter that Sarah was talking about yesterday. Great. Sorry about that. Farm hands. Hey, it's fine. No worries. Yes, I'm the I'm the reporter and I gotta say I'm pretty excited to be here. I can't wait to see how Sarah's gonna transform this place. Yeah, yeah. Super exciting. Look, we're in the middle of fall harvest right now so hopefully you can make room for both of us? Fall harvest, really? So I guess we can call this a, harvest wedding then? Sure. Hi. Hey there. That's interesting. - So I see you two have met. - Sure did. David here was just informing me about the big harvest going on now. Ok. And Peyton was telling me how much he's looking forward to you changing the place. Here we go. She doesn't look happy. No. - I'll be right back. - Yeah. Hello, Barbara. - I know what you're thinking. - I really don't think you do. Look, I promise you I can fix all of this. It'll be beautiful. Don't worry, mom. I have full faith in Sarah. Barbara, I believe you spoke to Peyton on the phone yesterday. Yes. Thank you so much for coming up. Hi, David. Thank you for the invitation. Can't wait to share in the adventure. Welcome, everybody. Welcome to the farm. We have a big day ahead of us. But first of all I just wanted to say thank you. I'm really honoured and I'm very excited to be planning this wedding. To be back home again, it's great, so it really means a lot to me. We have a lot to do. Not a lot of time to do it, but it doesn't mean we can't have a little fun, right? Not a lot of fun, Barbara, just a little. First things first. I wanna talk about ceremony location. Most important thing. It's kinda like the foundation of a wedding. Ok. Emma and I have been scouting around, we have some great ideas for everybody, so if you could just follow me. Great. What're you doing? You said you needed some help so I found some time. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm stuck! Can I get a little help here, please? I'm so sorry. Just pop those right out of there. Looks like you're sticking around, Barbara. So it's a little bit of a walk but when you see it it's gonna take your breath away. - Hey, Sarah? - Yeah? - Where are we going? - The little clearing by the stream. Yeah. It is the most beautiful spot in the entire farm. It's definitely pretty but... And, you know what? Barbara? There's this little pathway that leads to the water. You know what I'm gonna do with it? I'm gonna blanket it with white roses. Ok. And the ceremony? The ceremony is gonna be right by the stream with a backdrop of the mountains and the sun will be setting. - I wouldn't do it there. - What're you talking about? You know how the weather changes around here. One minute the rain, it'll flood out the wedding. Yeah. Yeah, he's right. Do you remember when we were in high school? We used to go tubing down that stream all the time. - That was the best. - It was. I loved those summers. We could still do that. What? Really? Excuse me. Alright, ok, what about the clearing on the north side? That's a good idea except there's cabbage and carrots there. That's up to harvest. What about the corral down by the old stable? Yeah. That's good, too. Except I have eggplant and corn there, also up for harvest. The supply bar. That cute little cluster of trees right there? Yeah, there's no trees there anymore, it's just cauliflower and broccoli which is also... Up for harvest. What can I say, folks? It's that time of year. You know, would you just excuse us just for one second, please? Great. What do you think? About? About where we're gonna have this wedding. - I heard churches are great. - Come on, David, stop. Look, I don't know what you want me to say. I don't know wedding spots. I'm a farmer on a farm. Use your imagination. Where's a place that, when you see it and you're there, it just... it feels special? Yeah, I know one place. Ok. Will it work? Yeah. Well, it's... it's close to the entrance and... and the house, and it's on level ground. I see a lot of potential. - Barbara? What do you think? - I'm not so sure. I'm just having trouble picturing it, that's all. Let me see what I can do. We'll begin in the late afternoon when the light is absolutely flawless and there's a soft autumn glow. White roses with touches of lace line the main drive as our guests make their way through the farm. And when they pull up to the house which, by the way, will be magazine-ready, they will see that the landscaping and the grounds are flawless. They are pristine. And then they will be ushered to a welcoming area, and there will be music and wine and champagne and people will be laughing and smiling and talking about how much they can't wait to see the bride and groom. And when it's time, everyone will make their way down a path of white roses to the tree, which will be draped with soft white silk, gently blowing in the breeze. There will be an aisle, it will be split with crisp white chairs and that is where everyone will sit when they witness Tom and Abby say those words 'I do'. And it will be emotional and breathtaking, and will remind everyone there of why they aspire to fall in love in the first place. Can you really do all of that? I can't wait to see it. That was definitely something. Hey, you coming? I'll catch up with you guys. I got a little work I gotta get done. Ok. And tomorrow Tony says he'll have all the dresses here by 3:00. Good. Yes. Check that box. Do we have the schedule for the load-in? Yeah, I got that right here. - Here you go. - Thank you. Is that you and your mom? Yeah. - It was at a wedding she planned. - I didn't know she was a planner. - I didn't tell you that? - No. Yeah. Well, she did it kinda like a... more as a hobby. But she was good at it. She's my inspiration. I remember she always used to tell me the best wedding planners find out what a person's dream is and makes it come true. - She sounds awesome. - She was. Wait a minute. I gotta meet David and his friend about the house. I'll be back in a little bit. I don't know, maybe I should just hire a crew. No, no, no. Look, you were right, the house should be fixed up for the wedding. I wanna do this for Tom and Abby. What about the harvest? We'll make it work. It's only a couple of days. Besides, Flemming here is a cracker jack landscaper, right? - Well, I cut mostly lawns. - No, no, he does gardens too. Yeah, sure. When they tell me what to do. Don't worry, alright? It's all gonna work out. Alright. Flemming, see you at the house tomorrow, I'll tell you exactly what needs to be done, ok? Sure. I'll walk you out. There's Peyton. I'll be right back. Nice to see you. Good. How are you? Who's that? He's this reporter for a magazine that wants to do a story on Sarah and the wedding. I guess they must really like her then? I can't wait for you to see the market tomorrow. Yeah. Well, like I said, I'm gonna try to stop by but I'm kinda busy. Well, you know, if you can. Let me ask you. What's the deal with Peyton? What do you mean? Well, do you think he's gonna write a good article about you? Well, I hope so. I mean, that magazine is known for not pulling any punches. I mean, not that I'd want them to anyway, ok? But I'm just saying, you know, this one, it's all on me. Hey, can I ask you something? Sure. Are you ok with where the ceremony location is? What, at the tree? Yeah. - I suggested it. - I know. I know, I'm just wondering if, you know, you remembered. Remembered... that you kissed me there? You kissed me. No way. Definitely the other way around. No, I'm serious. Are you ok with it? Yeah. The way I see it, it's always been a good spot. Yeah. Alright, well I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Come on. Well, here we are. I feel so stupid. So what. You hit the curb and blew out a couple tires. Everybody does it. Yeah, have you? Like, you know, three times last week. It was an accident. It's all good. No, I actually wasn't paying attention. Yeah, I see that. What were you thinking about? Just... I got a lot on my mind. Thank you. Yeah, you got it. Yeah. It does that sometimes. Let me help you. You hadn't got this fixed yet? All this time? I got a farm to run. I don't have time to fix a door. There. Thank you. Well... Where have you been? I just, I got in a little car accident. My gosh, are you ok? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just... I blew out my two front tires. It's embarrassing. I don't wanna talk about it. Ok. I got a message and it's a big one. You know who the chef is? Who is it? Does Collin Shaw ring a bell? Come on. Are you serious? Yes. Three Michelin stars Collin Shaw? Like, I don't think he's ever done a wedding before in his entire career Collin Shaw? This is huge! Do you understand? We are no longer planning the wedding of the season. We are planning the wedding of the century! Yes! There she is. Barbara! Collin Shaw? How'd you do that? We hosted a thing together in the city and let's just say he owed me. Well, now I owe you. Abby and I are off to a nail appointment but so you know I just sent you a revised list for some changes I'd like for the reception. Make sure you look at that. Sure. No problem. Excuse me for a second. Of course. Barbara King, that's right. Girly, you have Collin Shaw cooking for your wedding! Yeah, I know. It's, it's gonna be great. Are you ok? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I... I just keep thinking about my mother's new list. I mean, don't get me wrong. My mother has impeccable taste but everything's getting so much bigger than I imagined it would be, you know? Abby? Are you coming? I don't want to be late. You guys have fun. Flemming. Where are you? I knew it. You're gonna love these. Delicious. Have a great day. Thanks. David. Hey. Flemming's a no-show. Just the two of those? I went to the house, he's not there, I tried to call, he won't answer. Alright, alright, I'll talk to him. What's fresh today? These ones right here we just picked earlier today. Literally this morning. What about the tractor I asked you to move? What about it? It's still there. These ones are the ripe ones, right here. I'll move it. As soon as I get it running. What? Just because it's not running now doesn't mean I can't get it running. Please. Alright, look. I'll make you a little bet. If I can get it running you gotta cook me dinner. If I can't get it running then I've gotta take you some place fancy. You are driving me crazy. Not as crazy as this is gonna make you. Try that. It's a tomato. It is a Nichols family farm tomato. Give it a try. I've had one of your tomatoes before. You haven't tried them since I've taken over. Go on, try it. Ok, stop. Told you. This is good. I'm sorry, that's what? It's good. It's good, right? It's really good. I know. You know what? Let's go for a little walk. Can you take over for me for a sec? Sure thing. Come with me. Tobin White, how're you doing, buddy? Hey! This is my good friend, Sarah. Tobin here is the best butcher in the state. He's a flatterer. But he ain't lying. Here, try a piece. Ok. So good. It's not over. Thanks, Tobin. See you soon. Really good. Ms. MacDonald, my favourite person. Look at this. Hello. What you got for me? A lemon pie. You read my mind. How do you do that? A lady never tells her secrets. That's right. Thank you. This whole farm to table movement has changed everything for a local farmer. It's like bringing everybody back home. You get better food, better health, just a better community. You sound like you're on a crusade. I am. Hey, Stevie, how're you doing? Pretty good. Good. Everybody really loves you around here, don't they? What's not to love? Well, if that's the case, mister, why haven't you ever been married? What makes you think I haven't been? Because I've seen the inside of your house. Good point. I came close, but it's like my mom always says, it's hard to get married to someone when you're already married to your work. What? What? That's what Emma says to me. Those exact words. Really? Yeah. Maybe we still have something in common. You have something right here. Something where? Right there. Right here? No, right on your... Where? Here. There, now it's gone. Ok, look. I gotta get going but I'm gonna give you this so you can stay dry and I'll talk to you later. Are you sure? I'm a farm boy. Bye. Ok, thank you. Hey, lady. Hey. What're you doing here? I just had to speak to David about something. Just walking around, checking things out. Where's your mom? Back at the hotel. This is definitely not her vibe. Yeah, I wouldn't think so. I'm the opposite. I feel totally at home here. Really? Yeah. I love farmer's markets. I always have. There's something so nice about the whole community coming together to share what they're really passionate about. I don't know, it just feels really special to me. Sarah? Are you ok? Yeah, I just... Abby, I just realized I've been planning the wrong wedding. Thank you, guys. Appreciate that. Hi. I need to talk to you. Yeah? Sure. Yeah. I'm kinda slammed right now though, but... I know, but I want to move the reception. Yeah? Where? In here. If you haven't noticed I'm kinda using this space right now. Well, I mean, not in here, up there. Using that also, so... I know, it's a big ask but... Sarah, I really wish I could but I can't, ok? I wanna bring this wedding back to the farm. Make it more about what Tom and Abby wanted from the very beginning, which is... Simple? Can you hand that to me please? Look, all I'm saying... No, not that. The the book. Thank you. What's this? That's nothing. It looks like something. It's just a little experiment that I've been working on. What are you, like a mad scientist now? Only on nights and weekends. Look, I wish I could help you but I can't just pick up the entire operation and move it. I know it sounds crazy but you... you just gotta trust me on this one. What about this massive tent that you have coming in? I don't want the massive tent, ok? It's not the farm. I need something that feels grounded and organic. Did you just make a farming joke? David. You have an incredible space here and I know that we can turn it into something really special for them. Yeah, but where am I supposed to move everything? I thought about that. The old stable. It's not big enough. It is if you put the massive tent into the corral. Yeah, but then I've gotta redirect everything, my crews have gotta work double shifts, everybody's gotta come in... I know, but what does your heart tell you to do? Really? Fine. Yes. Ok, look, I'm gonna go on record, I'm doing this under protest. You are so lovable. Thank you. You want my company to fix the house and do all the landscaping? Look, we would not be asking you to do this if it weren't for the fact that your family owns one of the most successful real estate businesses in all of New York. I mean, this is not a big job for you. Not compared to what you're used to, but it does need to be done right and on time and Barbara I know you can do it. And there's something else. Yeah. There's something else. We need to change the wedding. Excuse me? You know what? This is partly my fault but I mean, we've kinda made this wedding about us, you know? About what we want. About lists and getting a good article. I mean, if we wanna plan a perfect wedding the only way we're gonna be able to do that is to give Tom and Abby what they want. Because this is their dream. Not ours. And, a little something for the new direction. You know, Marilyn Monroe once said 'give a girl the right shoes and she can conquer the world'. So what do you say, Barbara? Come on. We can't conquer this wedding without you. Please, mom? Is that a yes? Don't worry about it. It's gonna be beautiful. Great. Just what I've always wanted. A beautiful house. Come on. Ok, what do you want? Handsome? Even better. You are impossible to deal with. Come on. Knowing her she's gonna, like, paint my house silver or something. Stop it, David. Look, you just have to think of it this way, ok? You're gonna have more time for your harvesting and for all the stuff I'm making you move. Fine. You always could convince me to do whatever it is you wanted. That is not true. Yes, it is. You want some coffee? Yeah, please. Thank you. So, since you've been back I've been thinking a lot about how things were between us. Yeah? Yeah. I can remember pretty much everything we did, you know, the good, the bad. But for the life of me I can't actually remember how things ended between us. I don't know. Gosh, we were just kids. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying when I went off to school it's like this whole new world opened up to me and I think I just got a little... overwhelmed. Yeah. Yeah, I get that. I was overwhelmed, too, here at the farm. You like being a farmer, don't you? Yes I do. I really do, you know. This is where I'm supposed to be. It feels so good being back here. Yeah? Yeah. I've missed this place. And I've been doing some thinking and I think I'm gonna start coming back more often. Yep. That'd be great. But what about the article? What do you mean? Well, you said once the article comes out things are gonna blow up for you. How are you gonna have time to make that work? I'm... well, I just meant, you know, if... if it's possible I'd like to. Who's that? I forgot. Peyton's here to pick me up. Peyton? I thought you drove here. Emma needed the car so she just dropped me off. How are ya, buddy? Hey. You know, I could have given you a ride where you needed to go. Don't be ridiculous. We're going to the same place. Besides, didn't I just give you a lot of work to do? I'm joking. Listen, don't worry about the house, ok? I promise. Everything will be perfect. Silver everything. Hi there. Hi. You ready? Yeah. Who wants to get married? Sandwiches. Thanks, dad. I know this is a really big move, ok? And it couldn't have come at a worse time but I also know that we can do this. Ok, any questions? Great. Yes. A hand-tied clutch bouquet of traditional flowers. Simple yet elegant. I love it. Exactly what I wanted. That hedge is perfect. Now, if you could just move that potted plant a little bit over to the left. Food, ladies. That's good. And now all this landscaping needs to be redone. Where do you want me? First stall over here. I'm serious. Tell me something you think I wouldn't know about a wedding. Something you wouldn't know about a wedding? I thought you knew everything. Well, let's see if you can surprise me. Let's see. I know something. Do you know why we have a ring finger? Actually, I don't know. You don't know. Alright, it's because it's the only finger that has a vein that goes straight to your heart. You surprised me. No. Hold on. I'll be right back. Hey, what's wrong? The wedding's off. I mean, I answered his question, that's it. Ok. And I told him. I said that things are moving fast because, hello, they're moving fast. Very fast. I didn't mean anything. I told him the truth. What was I supposed to do? Lie to him? Of course I don't want her to lie to me. Of course. But when she tells me it's going fast, how am I supposed to interpret that? Maybe the way she meant it? I'm sorry. There's just so much going on right now with his deployment coming up and with all of these last minute changes with the wedding, which I love by the way. Then you know what he does? He freaks out. He totally freaks out. I did not freak out. I was very calm and I just asked her if maybe we should wait. And then he starts grilling me with all of these questions, asking if this is what I really want, if this is right, if we're right. I mean, of course we're right. I knew we were right before he knew we were right. I mean, don't I have a right to know? Yeah, of course you do. But you're a dope because you already knew. Have a seat, brother. Have a seat, Abby. What am I gonna do? Abby, you're not gonna do anything. Sweetie, these are just jitters. They're like the little hiccups of weddings. In fact, I would be worried if one of you didn't have them. Really? Yes. You know, you've been going a million miles per hour. I bet your head feels like it's spinning out of control. Falling in love? You know, that's... that's the easy part. But figuring out how to make it all work? That's the hard part. When you find somebody who believes in what you two can be together? That's the magic. And you don't wanna let that go. You got this. I am selfish and self-centered. And a dope. And a dope, and I am just so sorry, baby. All I wanna say to you is that you knew we were right before I knew we were right. Mission accomplished. Yeah, I'd say so. By the way I'm definitely gonna get that tractor running. You know what? I was thinking about that and since we changed the theme of the wedding it actually kinda works. I say leave it. I like it. Are you kidding me? What about the bet? I was gonna get the tractor running. Well, in that case I'll just assume you did. So I win the bet. And a home-cooked meal. See ya later tonight. Yep. You didn't win though. I let you win. What was that? You just made a face. - What? I didn't make a face. - Yeah you did, I just saw you. Ok fine, maybe I made a little bit of a face but that's just, you know, because your soup is so, exciting tasting. Exciting tasting? Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, but you know what? I happen to be a city girl. I don't really cook for myself. Is that because you wanna live? That's not nice. It may be a little bit true but it's not nice. Hey, cheers. What're we cheering to? We're cheering to you, actually pulling off this wedding. No! No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. You just jinxed me. See, if there's one thing that I've learned is even with all the planning in the world life still throws little surprises at you. Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it. You know what? There was something I wanted to talk to you about. You know, while I was making your very exciting tasting soup, I ran across more of this. You got a lot of them in there. Alright? So you're stuck with me. What is it? Tell me. This is bonding insulator. Bonding insulator? Ok. What is bonding insulator? Well, this is basically organic tar. You can put it on your roof, you can put it on a road, but you know, the really cool thing about this is, if it works, is that you can actually grow things in it. When did you get in to agricultural chemistry? I picked up a few things here and there. But I'm also working with a professor over at the college. Ok. Alright, hold on. So let me get this straight. If this works you can basically grow anything anywhere? Theoretically. But right now we're just playing around with this. This is just fun, you know? It's like we're wrestling with mother nature. Ok, but what do you plan on doing with it? Have you talked to any investors? No. No, I don't have time for any of that. Well, David, if it's something you believe in then you make time. Do you know how many years that would take? Really, there would be testing and then years with the FDA. No, no, no. David. David. How do you expect to know what's possible if you don't even try? Wait. What's wrong? I just... I thought that you... I... You know what? Maybe I... Maybe I should go. What's going on here? Nothing. Do you wanna go right now? Well, I just have a lot of work to do. No. Sarah. I... I need to go. Hey. You're back early. Dinner wasn't good? No. I mean yeah, no, dinner... dinner was fine. Did, Collin Shaw send over a menu? He did. Ok, good. I wanna check the place settings for each one of the tables and, the... Sarah? Are you ok, honey? Yeah. Hey. Hey! What are you... what are you doing here? I was wondering if I could coax you out for a quick nightcap. I was hoping we could go over a few more details about the article. My editor is really hoping to see a few pages tomorrow and I was just... I don't know, I was thinking if I showed up I might be able to twist your arm. Please? You'd really be helping me out. - Yeah. Yeah. - Ok. It won't be long, I promise. I'll be back. So the couple's on the dance floor and they're dancing, right? But when the groom spins her she totally loses control and she goes sailing right into the pool! Hang on, you didn't plan that wedding, did you? No, no. I didn't plan that wedding. Peyton, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm horrible company. It was actually a really funny story I just... you know, I got this wedding coming up but my head's kind of everywhere right now. I shouldn't have asked you out tonight. No. No, if it's for the article I wanna help. What? Look, I didn't expect this, but... What? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong, I just... I've just really had a great time being here, getting to know you. Me too. And I'm really liking the article but... I've also realized that I'm really liking you, too. I think you and I could really hit it off. We have so much in common. Our work, we're both career-oriented people, big dreamers. We both love New York. And we've had so much fun these last couple of weeks, haven't we? Yeah. Yeah, we have, Peyton. But it... I know, I know, the wedding, I know. My timing couldn't be worse, but I don't know, when we're back in the city maybe we could... we could go out sometime. You know, will you just excuse me for one second? Sure. Is everything alright? Yeah, everything's fine, I just have to use the ladies room, that's all. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Sorry. Thanks. Sarah. Hey. What're you doing here? I thought you had to work. I do. I mean, I did. I do have to work. You're here with Peyton. No, no. That's not what it looks like. I mean, it is what it looks like but I really don't want it to be. It's just kind of one of those... Don't worry about it. What? No, no, no, no. Hey, Sarah. I really don't need you to explain. Have a good night. Peyton. David, hi. Write a good article for her, would you? She deserves it. I know. David! David! Hey, honey. Hey, dad. You ok? Yeah. I know. Coming back home can be hard sometimes. Yeah. I just didn't know that coming back here and seeing him... I didn't know I was gonna have all these feelings. And now I do and I'm... just confused. Why not give it a shot? Maybe see what happens? Dad. How is that gonna work? I mean, we live two totally separate lives. Sure, but how can you know what's possible if you don't even try? This is the head table so please make it perfect. Thank you. Can we add a candle to that table? Easy with the stemware please. I'm gonna need you to get up on a ladder and just straighten that chandelier for me. Soup spoon on the right. Double knot the back of that chair. I'm gonna need you to go get the rest of the stemware, please. DJ booth goes right there. - Hi. - Hi. Just looking for Sarah? Yeah. She's right in there. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Sorry about last night. No, I'm sorry. It was it was very unprofessional of me to just spring that on you. And Peyton, I'm flattered, but I just... I can't think about that right now. Friends in the meantime? Friends. Ok, come on. I have to show you. Hey. Hey there. I was looking for you. When did you get back? About ten minutes ago. I'm sorry I didn't... No, no, no. It's ok. Tom told me. Listen David, I think we need to talk. Yes, we do. I agree. But first we gotta get through this. Get through what? There she is. Mrs. Nichols! I cannot believe it! It has been way too long, young lady! I know. So good to see you. This is the craziest thing ever, you turning out to be Tommy and Abby's wedding planner. I know. Now come on, I wanna hear everything. I wanna hear about New York, I wanna hear what you've been doing, I wanna hear about all these weddings you've been planning. There you are. I thought I'd find you here. Hey. Yeah, I know, I was just triple checking everything before the big day. Yeah. I gotta say, everything looks great. And I hate to admit that Barbara actually did a fantastic job with the house. She did. It looks beautiful and handsome all at the same time. David, maybe we should give it a shot. What're you talking about? Us. You know. Maybe, I don't know, maybe we should go on a date. You know, like an actual date. I didn't know how I was gonna feel about you before I came here. I thought we had both moved on. I thought we were different people. Yeah, so did I. But over the past couple of weeks I think that I've realized that... it still feels so much the same. Yeah, what about you and Peyton? There's no 'me and Peyton', ok? Peyton likes me, that's it. But the thing is, is I like you. And I just keep thinking about when we were growing up we were so good together and I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe we could be like that again. What about the other night? Ok, I panicked. I was... so much going on and I don't know what I was thinking. I think you did the right thing. What? Yeah. I should have never tried. Why are you saying that? Because, look, we're clinging on to the past, ok? That's what it was. It's the past. I'm here now. This is me. This is what I do, and you have so much. You got the whole future opening up to you. We could split our time. And what about your experiment? Experiment. I know people in New York who can help you with that. Sarah, listen. I took your advice about the experiment. I went and talked to this investment guy in North Hampton. He didn't bite. He thought it was a joke. That was just one guy, ok? And if that's the way he felt then he's the joke. Why can't we try? Sarah, we did try, ok? We fell in love when we were kids but that was a long time ago. Now we've moved on, we're living different lives, and reminiscing about that, that's not gonna change anything. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe what we were is all we were ever supposed to be. I'm sorry. Alright. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go. Sarah. Excuse me. This is it. Emma, Collin Shaw's restaurant just burned down. A kitchen fire? He was prepping food to bring to the wedding today and wound up cooking the entire restaurant. What're we gonna do? I have no idea. I know, maybe I can do a grocery run? Yeah, I'll call some friends and we'll all go together and... Dad, dad, no, no, no. That's... you're a genius. You're a genius, pop. What're you doing? I'm doing what I should have done from the very beginning. David? David. David. Yeah, what's up? My chef had a kitchen fire and accidentally burned down his whole restaurant with all of the food for the wedding. Well, that doesn't sound good. What're you gonna do? Aren't we in the middle of fall harvest? - Yeah. - Yeah. He's here. Mr. Shaw? Welcome to Williamstown. I don't know what I'm doing here. Everything was ruined. What do you expect me to do? Let's get to work, people. Yes, chef! Come in. It's time. We are all here today to celebrate the relationship of Thomas and Abigail to be witnessed... May we have the rings? David? David? Hey the rings? - The what? - The rings, please. Yeah. That would probably help. Abigail, do you take Thomas to be your husband for as long as you both shall live? I do. And Thomas, do you take Abigail to be your wife for as long as you both shall live? I do. You may kiss your bride. To Tom and Abbey! Cheers! Hey. Hey! So it's almost time for David's speech but I can't find him. I'll find him. Ok. Thanks. Hey. He is outside, by the tree. Please join them on the dance floor. Hey. Everybody's looking for you. It's time for your big speech. I just gotta say I'm sorry. Why? Because you're right. We were good together. And I wish things had worked out between us. Me too. I'd really like to believe that we could be something more but, honestly, the thought of losing you again, that's what's really stopping me. Yeah, but if we don't try... We'll never know what's possible. Yeah. You once said something to me. You told me that I should always follow my dreams no matter where they lead. Yeah, I remember that. What about now? I just realized that my dream is standing right here in front of me. Let's go back inside. Like I said, even with all the planning in the world, life always finds a way to surprise you. It was a beautiful wedding. Collin Shaw and David's friends put together one of the finest meals I have ever tasted. Ladies and gentlemen, Chef Collin Shaw. And it reminded me that sometimes the smallest towns can have the biggest hearts. And if you're wondering about the magazine, I did get the cover story. And even though I finally got what I wanted, I also learned how to slow things down a bit. You know, not plan as much. Try to relax and enjoy all of life's little surprises. I like it here. Yeah, me too. Subrip by Pix Sync-Fixes by VaVooM
