Susi. Susi. You don't have much milk this morning? Sir, have you seen Iskak? I don't think I've seen him. Okay. Thank you. Iskak! Iskak! Iskak. Iskak. Iskak. Iskak. I know, the animal feed prices are increasing. But you don't have to worry about it. At least your fate is better compared to your cousin's, Tasya, who has become corned beef now. Iskak. Iskak. Iskak! - What is it now? - Iskak. What is it, Ateng? Why wandering around in the morning? Why isn't Dad home yet? I thought you would say something important. Your dad is in Jogja, the palace called him. Be patient. He will be back. I hate it. He said he would be back yesterday. Young master. -I'm sorry, Uncle -Yes. Hey, Ateng! I've been looking all over for you! Get back inside. Your father's home. But wash your feet first. - Mbok, is master home already? - Yes, he is. You see, Ateng? Your dad is finally home. Dad is home. Dad is home, Dad is home. Dad? Dad! Dad! Where is he? Dad. Dad. Dad! - Dad. - Ateng! - Ateng. - Dad. - I got a cake? - Because it's your birthday. Yes. Iskak, Mbok, come here. That's wrong, Iskak. - That's better. - Now blow out the candles. One, two, blow out the candles... One, two, three! You haven't brushed your teeth. - Yes, I have. - When? - Two days ago. - No wonder you stink. One, two... I will give the first slice to Dad. Ateng, I want to say something to you. What do you want to say? You're heavy. Now you are a year older. You have to act more mature. You will do that, right? - I will think about it first. - Why think about it? I will act mature when I get my birthday present. Yeah, I forgot. You can ask anything from me. That's my birthday present for you. Really, Dad? -Really -Promise? Promise me first. I, Kanjeng Raden Tumenggung Budiman Nitisastro, make a promise today to Raden Mas Ateng Nitisastro, that I will give Raden Mas Ateng anything he wants. So what do you want for your birthday? - I want to go to Jakarta! - No! - You said I can have anything. - Anything, except for that. Then it's not anything. - You lied! - I didn't - Lied! - No! -Lied -No! - You will go to hell if you lie. - Ateng! Why did you say that? You cursed me. Ateng, let's eat. He's still sulking, Master. I think I'm going to sit here. Ateng. I've been thinking all day... till my head hurts. I understand... that I can't fight time, I can't fight fate and hold you back from getting mature. That's why I've decided, you can go to Jakarta. - You mean it? - I mean it. - Seriously? - Seriously. - You don't lie? - I don't lie. - Really, Dad? - Really, Dad Dad! Why are you repeating me? - You're happy now? - I'm happy. Thanks, Dad. You can go to Jakarta as long as you go with Iskak. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Now, let's eat. Come on. - I'm hungry, Dad. What? Why is everything wet? You're right. What is it? It wasn't there. But, now it's there. Maybe we have some leakage here. Hello, Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Iskak, everything here is shinning. Mbok Sutinah would have a stroke if she worked here. She would mop the floor every hour. Excuse me, Sir. This way please. Welcome to Crowne Plaza hotel. Have you made a reservation here? Yes, we have made a reservation. Awesome. -Great -May I know your name? Iskak Surotirto Kamandanu... Hadiwinoto Handayaningrat Tototentrem Kartoraharjo... Barotoyudo Joyobinangun. Can you say it one more time? Iskak Surotirto... Kamandanu Hadiwinoto... Handayaningrat Tototentrem... Kartoraharjo Barotoyudo Joyobinangun. That's a very long name. Yes. I was born in a train. Awesome. - Awesome. - Born in a train. You are Iskak! I'm sorry, Sir. Here you go. - Awesome. - Awesome. Awesome. I bet he was born in an economy train. Ateng, you will break the escalator! We check the venue now, after that we'll go to the receptionist. Okay, Mr. Boss. For the venue, I've already confirmed with the staff. Okay, good. Please come in. Enjoy your rest. Thank you. Wow, thank you! Finally! Now I can buy a piece of candy with this 500 Rp coin. You're welcome. Enjoy your rest! The room is spacious. It's only for the two of us, but the room is huge. Master has a lot of money. Of course. It's so soft. Let's check the bathroom. Cemplon, check the preparations again for tomorrow night Yes, Mr. Boss. For the seminar tomorrow, get the suit from the dry cleaners, bring it to the restaurant and I will have breakfast at 8:30 sharp. Got it. Yay, here's the bed. I am happy! After breakfast, we'll go directly to the seminar. Don't let what happened in Bandung happen here. If the laundry's late, I would have to go to the seminar with the hotel's bathrobe. Wow. Look. I don't want to work with people who can't manage time. - Understand? - Yes, I won't be late. - We are in Jakarta! - I am in Jakarta! - Thank you, Master! - I am in Jakarta! Ordinary people should not be allowed to stay in a five star hotel like this. Car! Hello! We're in Jakarta! Jakarta! Jakarta! Don't get trapped in the past. Because, the past plus the present equals trouble. Have any of you here applied my theory? Come on. Don't be shy. This is your opportunity to inspire the others. Okay. You, go ahead. Give him a big hand. So. How is it? It's like this. How did you fight from being a failure to becoming a successful man like today? For your information, ladies and gentlemen, I have attended Mr. Agung's seminar, and I managed to build and run my own company. Very good. Let's give him a round of applause. How long has your company been established? It's bankrupt now. But as we know for sure, I bet your family, your wife and children are always with you. My wife left me. And she took my children. That's why I joined your seminar again. I believe... by joining your program, I can move forward and welcome the future. And I know you can do it and all of you here can do it. I have experienced many downturns. But I am revived and now I'm a success. So remember. We have to leave the past behind because... The past plus the present equals trouble. My name is Agung Sadewa. I'll see you next time. You have to act fast in a situation like this. Yes. Sorry, Mr. Boss. After this seminar in the Crowne Hotel, clear my schedule for a month. I want a holiday. Do you think it's easy to convince those silly people that they have a bright future? Yes, Mr. Boss. Book the ticket and accommodation for London. For one person? Half. Cause I'm short. Of course for one. Are you sure, Boss? I mean, you don't want to book two tickets? You're not taking me? Okay. Two tickets. You're coming. You can pay for yourself. - Stingy. - That way I can get rich fast. Oh no. Morning, Sir. Morning, Kid. Morning. - Why are you calling me "kid"? - Come on, Kid. Let's have breakfast. Sorry, Sir. The restaurant is on the first floor. And this elevator is going up. You better take the other elevator. This poor kid, he will be late for breakfast. His round stomach will get flat. - I'm going to the 19th floor! - Ateng! Sir, what is your room number? Ateng, remember what the master said. You have to behave. If you act like this, I will have to report to him that you... Good, isn't it? Very sweet. It's good. This is for you. Eat it. Good, isn't it? -It's good -Eat it. Oh no, Ateng. I can't eat anymore. What's wrong, Iskak? Stomachache. I really have to go. I have to go to the bathroom. He dumps the food right away? I'll be dead. I'm late. Excuse me, Miss. Which room are you staying in? - Room 1630. - Okay, Miss. Go ahead. Mr. Boss, I'm sorry I overslept. Here is your suit. Ateng, you have to be extra careful in Jakarta. Plenty of criminals using hypnosis. They will act nice. But their hearts are evil. Avoid eye contact with them. Go! I'm sorry, Mr. Boss. I promise I won't be late again. Go! Yeah... Once again, I'm sorry, Mr. Boss. I'll put your suit here. Go! I'm scared, Iskak. Good mor... Oh, for goodness sake. - First floor. - Please. I need to go to the first floor, please. Why are you looking at me like that? No. Nothing. Praise be to God. I seek forgiveness from Allah! - We meet again. - I seek refuge from the accursed Satan. Sir, which way is the toilet? Sir, Sir? Room 1626. Not bad, Cemplon. RESIGNATION LETTER Mr. Boss. - Mr. Boss, this is my resignation Le... - Have you had breakfast? Not yet. Are you on a diet? But you... Get some breakfast. I'm going to get mine too. Iskak... Aunty, have you seen Iskak? Iskak? No. - It's time, Mr. Boss. - Okay, I will get ready. Iskak! There it is. The toilet. Where is he? Where is Ateng? Iskak? Iskak. Here you go, Mr. Boss. Iskak. Great timing. It stinks. Who's using the toilet? Me. Ateng, Sir. That was a rhetorical question. You don't have to answer me. I'm not a terrorist. Just do your business. Don't answer me. What a grumpy man. Hello, Mr. Grumpy. Ghost! Mr. Boss. Where's the ghost, Sir? You! Ghost! You are the ghost! Are you all right, Ateng? Ghost! Wake up, man. Wake up. Wake up. If you look at the star, pretty lady I'm waiting for you to come Turns out, being slapped by an angel is so nice. Can't imagine being kissed. Stop it. You're just waking up from fainting, but you flirting with me already. What if you didn't faint? So, I'm not dreaming? Why are there two of you? There must be some explanation for why we both look alike. I don't understand. I thought the copy machine would only work with papers. Twins! You must be twins! That's possible. You... Aceng. It's Ateng. Not Aceng. Yeah. Who are your parents? This is Ateng, and this is Ateng's father. Wait... This is me, and this is Mom. I have a mom. Iskak, I have a mom. I have a brother. Iskak, I have a brother. Ateng has a brother. I have a brother. Sorry I'm late. Please sit down, Cemplon. Thank you. Sit down, please. Sorry, the seminar just finished. As usual, they have a photo session after. What if we eat first? Cemplon, what do you want to eat? I will order a drink for now. I want a latte and... - I want... - a black coffee for her. Thank you. - Oh, right. Aceng, so... - It's Ateng. Why do you keep forgetting your own brother's name? We just met this morning. I even forget my assistant's name sometimes. Cemplon. Her name is Cemplon. C-E-M-P-L-O-N. Why are you yelling at me? About Mr. Budiman... - Our father? - Yes. You said that he had the aristocratic status in Salatiga? He has plenty of farms, plantations and land. Correct? Yes. It means I'm entitled to his fortune when he dies? Watch what you're saying. He is my master. Sit down. - He talks nonsense. - Sit down. I seek the forgiveness of Allah. I'm talking about the fact that I am also his son. And now I want to get to know more about Mr. Budi... I mean, my father. What do you think the best way to do that is? Why don't you just go there and visit him? I can't do that. When they got separated, they each took one son of their pick. There must be a reason for that. And I think my master has made the right decision. Can you shut up? Cemplon, it needs a strategy. Okay. What about this? What if each of you meet the parents that you don't know? How do we do that? I have an idea. Cemplon, apparently you can think better, compared to your boss. I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Agung, the greatest motivator. I'm the brother of Ateng, the best friend of Iskak and the son of Budiman, who owns a cute cow named Susi. Iskak, am I good enough to play the role as Agung? You're good. Good. There's Ateng. Ateng. Shut up. Hello. My name is Agung. The past plus the present equals... - Really? - Very good, Ateng. Oh God. I'm doomed. All right. We will do our plan. But don't you have another outfit? You forgot? That's the point of our plan. You will play the role of Ateng, so you can get to know your father. And Ateng will play the role of Agung, so he can get to know your mother. One week is enough before we decide the next step of our mission. - What do you think? - Shall we do it? Agung, you agree? Don't try to be funny. Remember. Just do it like we practiced before. Yes, Iskak. I understand. - Like that? - Yes. Mbok! Ateng and Iskak are home. Ateng is home... Sir. My job is to drive you here, not to dance, right, Sir? If you want to dance, that's okay too. - But, it's heavy. - Put the suitcases on the porch. There. How was Jakarta? I missed you so much. Susi's been looking for you too. Don't you miss Susi's milk? I seek forgiveness from Allah. Susi's milk? Yes. Susi's sad that you don't drink her milk anymore. Sir, don't forget. Rate me five stars. Yes. Five stars. I will give you that. You're Edy, right? Edy what? - Sud. - Edy? Sud. Yes. Thank you. Now you talk differently because you just got back from Jakarta. Usually you ask for Susi's milk every morning. Susi will only give her milk to you. You are that close. Ma'am. Mrs. Ratna? We're here. Agung, you're home? Mom! What's happening? What's wrong? What's wrong? Boss just watched a Korean drama. I think he just got carried away. You make me worried. How was the seminar? Was it good? It was good. Thank God. - I'm going now, okay? - I'll go with you. Agung, what's the matter with you? Okay then. Peace be upon you. And unto you peace. Where are you going? I just met Mom, but she left me already. - Mom! - Just hang on. She will be back soon. - She won't be long. - Really? She won't be long? No, she won't. This is Mr. Boss's room. The first rule in this house is you have to put everything back in its place. And put it back correctly. Wow, Agung is amazing. Those are only some of his certificates of merit. The rest of them are stored. I have a certificate too. - Really? What certificate? - From the sack race game. - I was the fifth runner up. - You won, great. Cemplon, which one is greater? Ateng or Agung? To be honest, your brother is greater than you. But... I like you more. Really? Hurry up and change. Mbok Sutinah told you to change. - What are you doing? - Change your clothes. Iskak, this is harassment. I can report you to the police. But I always help Ateng change his clothes. Iskak! Hey, hey! What? You change his clothes? What is he? A baby? If I don't help him, he won't change his clothes. Iskak! This is your fault! You've been spoiling him too much. - That's what makes him like that. - Nothing's wrong with Ateng. He's a nice kid. Unlike... Unlike who? Who cares? Why don't you guess? If I answer you, you will report me to the police. Mbok. Where's my son? Is he here already? He's here. He's in his room, changing. I miss his complaining Ateng! Your father is here. Hurry up and change. Come on. Ateng. My son. Come here. Come here. Come to daddy. I missed you so much. It feels like it's been years since I saw you. Are you crying? It's nothing. I just missed you. I was sad because you weren't there. There, there. I am here now. You don't need to cry again. Master, I am back. If you cry, you will look ugly. Master, I am back. I have seen you and I don't care. Just kidding. Joking. Okay, Master. Let's talk here at the dining table. - The food is ready. - Yeah. Oh, right. While you were gone, Susi's milk tasted different. Not as good as usual. Maybe she misses you. You drink her milk too? Of course. All of us here are enjoying her milk. I even sometimes invite all the people in this neighborhood to stand in line and enjoy how great Susi's milk is. Susi is very kind. All right. I need to use the bathroom. I'll be right back. Insane. What a bitch that Susi is. She's even worse that the city women. But Susi's heart is only for you. Whatever! -Dad -Yes? Dad. Since I came back from Jakarta, I've been thinking. Thinking about what? What if I move to Jakarta and work there? - What makes you think like that? - It's nice in Jakarta. Everybody there has money. I want to have money too. Ateng. I have money. It means, eventually you will have money too. You don't need to worry. Eventually? You mean inheritance? Of course. But wait till your dad "checks out." "Checks out"? "Game over." Dead. I don't want you to die. I will be alone then. Ateng, everybody will die. Including me. But don't worry. You won't be alone. You have... I have who? You have Iskak, you have Mbok Sutinah. Including Susi. Okay? You understand, right? Yes, I understand. Agung, are you still going to London? You got the visa and the tickets already? A cross? A rope? Ultraman! Agung! What's wrong with you? Mr. Boss is feeling restless right now. I am still thinking about going there for vacation. Act natural. I miss having a lot of time to spend with you, Mom. I've been busy lately. I miss spending time with you. My own wife! The only thing you think about is your work. You just got back from Jakarta. You've only been here a week, and now you're going back there again. - What is it that you're pursuing? - I'm moving up the ladder in my career. And the opportunity doesn't knock twice. Marrying me, you don't need to worry about money. Why do you still work? - This is not about money! - About what then? It's a matter of achieving success without anyone's help! I am not anyone! I am your husband! Now you choose. Go to Jakarta to work, or stay here, with your family. Answer me. Is my love not enough? For now, it's not. Mom? What did you say? - Why are you crying? - I'm not crying. I got something in my eyes. So what did you say? Are you still going to London? Listen. What if we go for vacation to... What if we go to Bali? Right. Let's go to Bali. What do you think? Cemplon can arrange everything. Okay, Mom? You go. But don't forget to bring my my favorite pia cake. - Okay? - Yes. Excuse me a minute. Cemplon, how's the situation there? So far so good. We had a small problem but it's solved now. Good. How's Mom? She's fine. She's not suspicious so far. But I see a bit of a difference in Mom's behaviour. - Is she sick? - No. She's in good health. But since meeting the fake Mr. Boss, she seems more sentimental. Especially when the fake Mr. Boss asked her to go on vacation. What? He asked her to go on vacation? Who will pay for that? I'm sure he will use my money. But your mom would probably say no. But, if I may share my opinion, now is the perfect timing. Because your mom was very touched when asked to go on vacation to Bali. She even looked like she's going to cry. Listen. I think it will be a very good idea if Mr. Budiman and Mrs. Ratna meet again, they will fall in love again and finally get remarried, then you don't have to worry about inheritance. You will surely get your share. Good idea. We will go to Bali then. I will take care of it on this side. Okay, Mr. Boss. Oh, yeah. Iskak will come too, right? You're sneaky. - Remember, next step is Bali. - Got it. Susi, susi, susi What do you want to be when you grow up? This is Susi? So you just made fun of me, huh? What are you talking about? Don't disturb me. Go. You will upset her and affect her milk. Iskak, listen. We have a new plan. What plan? We have to arrange a vacation for Mom and Dad to Bali. So we have to pretend to go on vacation there. That's a terrible idea. That's Cemplon's idea. Wow, that's an amazing idea! That woman has a golden brain. I guess I chose the right woman. But do you think that plan will work? Cemplon said Mom cried at the dining table. I know Mom very well. If she sheds a tear, I bet she misses Dad very much. But she's hiding it. Agung. - Someone's looking for you. - Who? Susi, this is Agung. Agung, this is Susi. Iskak, don't joke! Weird. This Tempe is tasteless. You know, Master. It's about age. She forgets everything. She must have forgot to soak the Tempe in salt. Iskak, don't talk like that about the elder. It's a sin. Ateng. You are different now. Forgive me, Master. Forgive me... I have nothing to do with this. Really, Master. Forgive me. Forgive me, Master. I just helped them. I did what they told me. Forgive me. - What's wrong with you? - Forgive me. What are you doing? I just said that Ateng is different now. Since he got back from Jakarta, he behaves more mature. What's wrong with you? I'm proud of you. That's for sure. I taught him that. Because I always remember what you said. "Iskak, please take care of Ateng. Please guide Ateng." I always remind him. Ateng, you are 26 years old now. You have to act mature. If he's more mature now, it's because of me. You're lucky I'm here. It's all my idea. Enough. You better go inside now. Take all these plates. I need to talk to Ateng. Okay? Listen to me. I think this is the right moment for us to talk. Ateng is a big boy now. So I think it's time for me to introduce you to someone. What do you mean? I'd like to introduce you to our neighbor. I know, Master. That one, Ateng. Uncle Ono. The expert on polygamy. He has a wife in every district. His stamina is... Wow. Amazing. Iskak, it's not him. Stop talking nonsense. Just go. I thought... Listen. I feel guilty. To let you grow up without a mother figure. You mean... You want me to meet my mom? No. We shall let the past be the past. We should now embrace the future. I heard some motivator say, the past plus the present equals trouble. What's the name of that motivator? I forgot. But he's right. So we have to embrace the future. I'd like to introduce you to our neighbor. Do you know who our neighbor is? Jeng Iis. We're in trouble. Iskak, do you know that Jeng Jeng woman? Yes. How is she? It's scary. Local rumor has it, she has a ghost. - Ghost? - Yes. Because she never seems to have work, but she always has money. We have to tell Ateng and Cemplon now. He will be shocked to hear this news. He will be sulking forever. Don't tell them now. It can ruin our plan. We'll wait until tomorrow. What if the ghost is already here, now? Are you trying to scare me? Get out of here. Maybe you are the ghost. You call me a ghost? Who's the short one here? Mom. Agung? You're not sleeping yet? I'm still thinking about our plan to go to Bali. Sit down. Are you sure you want to take me on vacation? You always go alone. Mom, I will never go on vacation ever again, if it's not with you. Ateng. Ateng. - Ateng! - Mbok. You seem like you have many things going on in your mind. Yeah, I'm in a dilemma now. That's weird. Why is it weird? First, you never have a lot on your mind because you never think. Second, I've noticed that you talk strange lately. You just said "dilemma" or whatever. - I just... - What? I'm upset. Dad is going to marry again. I agree with you. Jeng Iis is not suitable for Master. - The suitable woman for him is only... - Who is she, Mbok? All right, let's just pray for him. Pray that they won't get married. Mbok, prayer without effort is pointless. That's the reason why it's hard for people in the village to develop. Iskak. What is it, Mbok? You have to be honest with me. - Why has Ateng been acting weird lately? - What do you mean weird? Ateng is not like Ateng. If he's not like Ateng, then who is he like? - That's nonsense. - Sit down. I'm not done with you. Don't you dare lie to me. I am the descendant of the great shaman. I can turn you into a rice duck. Mbok, grandma was a masseuse. So what if she was a masseuse? At least my spell still can give you pain in your waist for the rest of your life. Do you want that? Iskak, I've known you since you were a kid and you're good boy, even though you're not smart. At least you won't lie to people. You are honest. You don't lie. And now you want to lie? Grave punishment, that's what you will get. - No! - Whatever! No! Why should I get a grave punishment? Whatever! You can talk, or you can stay silent. What? All right. Come here. What? Come here. I will tell you the secret. Ma'am. Ma'am. Wait, Ma'am. Ma'am, please let me hold Agung for the last time. Agung. Agung. Please take care of Ateng. Ma'am! Agung! Master. Agung! Mbok? Mbok, you scared me. You scared me twice today. I could get a heart attack. I could go and die. No, don't go. Don't leave me again, Agung. Since you were born, I've always considered you as my son. Mbok. So you know already? Mbok. Don't cry. That's true. God answered my prayer. You came back to this house. Don't ever leave again, Agung. That's the plan. But we have to get Mom and Dad together again. You got my support. Dad. Yes, Ateng. What is it? When I was on vacation in Jakarta, - I was thinking. - Thinking of what? It's not nice to go on a vacation without you. So what are you trying to say? What if I have another vacation... but you come this time. Okay. Where do you want to go? Bali. Okay. Let's go to Bali for vacation. I think it would also be a good time to get you acquainted with your future step mother. I will bring Jeng Iis with us. - Mbok, what's happening? - Nothing. Excuse me. It's a very nice hotel. It must be expensive here. Good day. Welcome to Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua. May I help you? -I want to check in -Very well. Are you sure you want to stay here? Yes, Mom. It's not that expensive. There's something that's more expensive. Is there? This is more expensive. Here's your ID card. - Oh, right. Yes. - Here is your ID card. And here's your key. Thank you. And please take the luggage to Mr. Agung's room. - Yes, Ma'am. - Thank you. You get some rest, Ma'am. Mr. Agung and I have some business to do downstairs. Business? What business? Jogging. Jogging? In the broad daylight like this? He meant, checking out the facilities here for jogging in the morning. Right. Okay then. Enjoy. Ateng! Come here! Iskak should've been here by now. I told him to come early, so we can set up our strategy. Wow. Iskak? What do you think, Ateng? - Am I cool or what? - What has gotten into you? Let's take these off, so I can see clearly. Listen, Cemplon. I know I don't have anything. But, I will dedicate all my heart and soul to you. And as a deposit... please accept these flowers for now. Iskak, are you insane? We are here for Agung's and my parents. To make them fall in love again. We didn't come here for you. We will settle the issue with Master and Madam. But the flame of love in my heart has to be expressed right away. I would have a stroke if I keep holding it in my heart. Bad news! Bad News! This is bad news. You sit down first. Sit down. Listen. Dad is coming here with Jeng Iis. Who is Jeng Iis, Mr. Boss? - His girlfriend. - Oh, no. What should we do? - I am clueless too. - It will ruin our plan. We are in trouble. Cemplon. That's a good idea. I know, right? - But which idea, Mr. Boss? - The one you just said. Trouble. We will make trouble. Well structured and well planned trouble. What do you mean? I can't... You just can't think anyway. Now listen to me. Out of all of us here, which one is the most troubled? Ateng, we will change places again. You will become you and I will become me. But I am me, and you are you. I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ateng! I mean, now you're back to being Ateng again. And I become Agung. Now, let's delegate our jobs. We'll set a plan for Mom and Dad to meet at the restaurant. Dad and Jeng Iis are now on the way from Seminyak. ETA in ten minutes. What is ETA? ETA is E-T-A. You don't know that? You hear that? ETA is, "Don't know about Ateng." No, Iskak! ETA is Estimated Time of Arrival. So in ten minutes they will arrive in the hotel lobby. - Did you choose this hotel? - Ateng did. - I didn't know about it. - Dad. - Ateng. - Dad. You have changed too. Very nice. It's unlike you. Are you going somewhere? I want to see the city while I'm in Bali. I have a feeling that we will become BFF. - What is that? - Best Friend Forever. You should know about social media. Make sure that Jeng Iblis will not interfere. How do I do that? Ateng, you're the trouble maker. You make trouble all the time. - Ouch! It hurts... - Ateng! Ateng, what's wrong with you? You haven't eaten? Are you hungry? I am not used to it if a stranger holds my hand. So that you're not strangers anymore, you should take a walk with her. Is your hand okay? It's fine. I will get a rabies shot just to be safe. Rabies shot is for if you get bitten by an animal. It's my son. - Sorry, Honey. I forgot. - But you forget all the time. And my job is to set them up to meet at the restaurant. Mom, Mom. Agung, why did you change your clothes? This is Bali. I can't dress up like I'm going to work. Okay. You two take a walk. I will check in first. Let me take your purse Thank you. -Bye -Yeah. Mom, what if we have a family dinner tonight? Okay. What time? At six sharp. At the restaurant downstairs. Now I will take a walk. Please dress up beautifully tonight. Why should I dress up beautifully? It's a family dinner, Mom! Dad. Ateng? You're back already? Where's Jeng Iis? Jeng Isis is in the toilet now. Iis! I have an idea. What about dinner together, so we can get to know each other better? Good idea. What time? At six sharp. You have to dress up nicely. Ateng, when did you change your clothes? Ateng! Ateng, you wait outside. I don't think they have enough space for you inside. - Hello. - Ateng. Your brother wants to know the situation there. Is everything fine? What fine? I've become a porter here. I have to carry her shopping bags. Ateng, remember. At six o'clock, okay? And it's half past five now. Okay? Yes, Cemplon. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Ateng, I just bought a new swimming suit. Now that I'm in Bali, I want to go to the beach. Beach, okay? Here. Mr. Boss. Asking permission to talk. May I? Cemplon, have I ever forbidden you from talking? I hired you because you can talk. Listen, Mr. Boss. I'm so touched by your efforts to reconcile your parents, that it makes me suspicious. Suspicious of what? Maybe your intention is no longer about the inheritance. What are you talking about? I can see that you are gradually changing. Your heart is getting softer. More sensitive. Says who? No, Cemplon. My target is the inheritance. I am entitled to it. Yeah, but if it's only for that, the Mr. Agung Sadewa that I know wouldn't want to go to this much trouble. He would just hire a lawyer and sue him through legal channels, and done. You're right. I really want my parents to be reconciled. I don't know why. Even I got confused. Because you still have a heart. Just like Ateng. But, I'm still way smarter than him, aren't I? Good afternoon, Sir. Agung. You're Agung, right? Yes. Agung Sadewa. I'm a big fan of yours. I have every video of your motivation programs. Because of your videos, now I can have this business. Thank you. - And your name is? - Gusti. - Gusti, can you do me a favor? - For you, sure. I can do that. Thank you. - Jeng Iis. - What is it, Ateng? That parasailing guy said he would give you free tickets. How come? Do they have a promotional program? He said he was fascinated by your beauty. He said you looked like Krisdayanti. Really? Apparently some ordinary people can have good taste too. But it's a good offer. I've been wanting to try parasailing. - Perfect. Let's go then. - Come on. Hello, guys. I'm in Bali now, and I'm trying the parasailing here. Help! Help! Bye, Jeng Iis. Cemplon, where's Ateng? Now you check on Iskak to see if he's ready or not. This beautiful moment has to be documented properly. Got it. Ateng, how was it? You did it? It's done. If it's going as planned, Jeng Pipis is now landing in Madura. - What is the date today? - Why? I want to remember this day. First, Mom and Dad will meet again today and fall in love with each other again. And second, apparently I can count on you. Ateng. I'm Agung, little brother. Agung, hide. That's Dad. He will find out that you're not Ateng. But I'm playing the role of Ateng. What? You said we were back to normal. All right. Listen. Who wants to be Ateng now? Okay. You go. Dad? There you are. It's time. I hope Mrs. Ratna will come on ti... I've now just realized... that my master is the stupidest man in the world. How could he let go of such a beautiful angel like her? But don't worry. I will not make the same mistake. You are so sweet. Agung. - Budiman. - Ratna. - Why are you here? - Why are you here? Ateng. Ateng? Ateng? This is Ateng? Ateng my son. Yes, Mom. I'm your son. I missed you, Mom. I missed you, Mom. Iskak, take the pictures. - Don't forget to take off the cap. - Oh no. I forgot. I got carried away. Dad. Mom. Agung and I know everything. Agung? Is Agung here? Where is he, Ateng? Where is Agung? Let me know where is he. I'm here, Dad. Agung? I missed you so much, Son. Oh God! Finally, I can meet you. God has willed it. I want to be loved, Dad. I have always loved you. You've grown up now. Dad. We changed places for the past week. You changed place with Ateng? Is that true, Ateng? Ratna. We need to talk. You haven't changed. You're still beautiful. You too. You're still the same old Budiman. What do you mean? You still make my heart skip a beat every time I see you. I have changed a lot, Ratna. My hair has gone gray. My body is not as strong as it used to be. Every time I carry Ateng, he would asked me to rock him. I have a difficulty in passing urine sometimes. But there's one thing that never changed. My feelings for you. Apparently I... I still... I... I also still... But it would be selfish if we talk about our feelings now. We have to explain it to the kids, why we separated them. Let me explain it to them. I am a man. I have to... I will explain it to them. Listen to me, Agung, Ateng. I think you should start it, Ratna. A long time ago... the rules were totally different compared to now. Yes. Different. Your father is from an aristocratic family. He has to have a successor, a son. So... you're only allowed to have one son? If you have two sons, you don't need the other one. It's not like that. When your mom and I were separated, I was still deeply in love with her. I loved her so much that I didn't have the heart to take you and Ateng with me. Cause then your mom would be alone. She was the one who gave birth to you. She was the one who carried you in her womb. That would be unfair if she had to be alone. That's why we agreed... that Ateng would stay with Dad and Agung would stay with me. And that was... That was the second hardest decision I have ever made, after I separated with your mom. Fortunately, in the beginning of our separation, I got help from Mbok Sutinah. She's the one who raised Ateng. And also Iskak, who befriended Ateng since he was a kid. Do you know why I got stressed? Because I had lost you, Son. I lost you. The son that I had to let go. But because I was such an idiot... I let you and your mom go. Ateng. Please forgive me, because I left you. But you're always in my prayers. And for that I am sorry. I am sorry. You will forgive me, right? Forgive me, Agung. I'm sorry. This is my fault. We haven't had dinner yet, right? Let's have dinner together. Okay, Ratna? Iskak, enough with the pictures. Come here. We're having dinner together now. How did you know that I was here? You're wearing pink at night, you look like a squid in the dark. Come here. Bring your new girlfriend too. My new girlfriend. Master, let me take your picture. Let's take some pictures. Master and Lady Master, feed each other. There you go. - Is it good, Iskak? - Cemplon, I have very sharp eyes. I can even see your beauty. Budiman. Ateng was so mean to me. Watch what you're saying about my son. So you're Ateng's mom. What's going on here? How come you're all having fun here? Don't you know that I almost landed in Madura with a parachute because of Ateng? I hate it. Who are you? I am Budiman's fiancee. We're getting married soon. Right? We love each other inside out. If that's the case... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Mom. Mom. Mr. Boss. Our plan is officially ruined. Yes, Cemplon. Mr. Boss, I have an idea of how to turn the situation around. What idea is that? This is my idea. In Bali, there's a food called the "mushroom." It can make you hallucinate. Excuse me. This is a complimentary drink from the restaurant... for this beautiful lady. - For me? - Yes. We will give it to Jeng Iis. When she starts hallucinating, I bet Mr. Budiman will think twice about her. Problem solved! Wait, wait. You look familiar to me. Have we met somewhere? Many people said I look a lot like the famous stand up comedian. Who? Raditya Dika. Excuse me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I don't see the resemblance. I'm so full now. You finish this, okay? I'm going to my room now. Of course she's full. She ate all the food here. Oh no. - What should we do? - Why is Master eating it? Oh no, Cemplon. We're in trouble. - What if he's dead? - Calm down. - Who will pay my salary? - We'll find a solution. I will be jobless! Where should I look for a new job? Master? Iskak! I know, Iskak. I know, Iskak! - I know! - It's not my idea! Get yourself together! I know Iskak, and Iskak's girlfriend. We're not officially dating yet. Just give us your blessing. I will give you my blessing on one condition. Tell me where the room of my lover is? Jeng Iis is in room 63... Not her. Ratna. In room 3210. Now I give my blessing for you two to become husband and wife. But it should be reversed. You will become the husband and you become the wife. That's still wrong, Master. It's open already. Excuse me. You? Why... We are twins! Who dumped you? Your Mom or your Dad? Ratna. Open the door. - Budiman? - Hi, Ratna. What's happening to you? I should be asking you the same question. Why did you leave me when I still loved you? - Are you drunk? - I am not drunk. My brain is filled with our beautiful memories. Everything about us is coming back to me now. Do you remember that song? That ballad always makes you fall in love with me? That song is always there between us. Do you remember that song? Look at these eyes, see this love Burning and will never die Do you remember that song? You're coming with me now. Come with me. - No. Where are we going? - Let's have a date. We're too old now. Please, Ratna. I want to be with you for the last time. -Ratna, I will sing one more time -Stop it. Two more times. - Don't. - It's enough? - I really don't mind singing once again. - It's okay. - Two or three more times. - No. - Where are we going? - Just come with me. Budiman, why did we stop? Who is the drunk one here? Me or you? How can we go if the traffic light is red? I'm sorry, Ratna. For everything. I entrust Agung to your care. Keep raising him to be a smart boy. You too. I entrust Ateng to your care. Keep raising him to be a happy boy. Budiman, it's green now. - Ratna, I need one more favor. - What is it? Please look ahead. My vision has started to get blurry. Watch out! Tree! - Where? - There! Where? Oh, you're right! Luckily your scooter ran slow. That's why you only got some scratches. You will stay here for now. - Thank you, Doctor. - Yes. Excuse me. - Have you called Agung? - Yes. They said they would come here. Why would they come here? I'd be so embarrassed, Ratna. If my kids know their father was drunk and hit a tree, oh my God! - How can I face them? - What should we do then? Mom! Dad! They're here. Please do me a favor. Pretend to faint. One, two, three! Budiman! Are you insane or still drunk? Mom. Please protect my honor in front of the children. One, two, three! Because of your honor, it cost you a son, you know that? Please, Ratna. Just this once. One, two, three! - Mom! - Ateng, they're here. Where do you think you're going? - They're our parents. - Okay. Mom. Dad. Wake up. Agung. Mom. Mom. Dad. Dad, wake up. I want to say something, Dad. Dad. Dad! Agung, did we fail? It's me who failed. Failed to be a motivator. I failed to motivate Dad and Mom to be reconciled. So you were right. The past plus the present... equals trouble. No. I was wrong. The past and the present can not be separated. We have to learn from the past to make a better present and a prosperous future. Everything turns out to be connected. You mean, like Mom and Dad? They're trying to avoid the past. But there's no way they can do that. Right, Agung? The present eventually will become the past too someday. That's why family is so important. We need family to protect us, family to take care of us. Where did the family come from if not from the past? Oh no. To hear everything you say is making me confused. It makes me think too much It's giving me a headache. I'm not used to it. It's not your job to think too much. It's your brother's job. Your job is to remind your brother that there's something more important than money in this life. What is that? Family. No matter how smart you are, how rich you are, without family, we're still weak. Just get some rest, Dad. I want to be alone for a while. Come on, Iskak. Excuse me, Master. Next time, if you want, I can take you for a ride on the scooter. I entrust Agung to your care. Keep raising him to be a smart boy. You too. I entrust Ateng to your care. Keep raising him to be a happy boy. Ateng? Iskak? What are you doing here? Ateng? Mom. Who did you come here with? I came here with... Budiman? What are you doing here? I'm looking for my wife. Do you know where she is? Ratna. I did let my wife go for a very stupid reason once. I promise. I will never make the same mistake. Do you know where my wife is? A great woman, the most wonderful woman I've ever seen. The mother of my children. Do you know where she is? Please let me know, Ratna. Where is she? She is here. She's not going anywhere. I thought you forgot about me already. How can I possibly forget you? You never went anywhere. You're always here. Every second. Ratna, will you accept me, and let my heart be your home again? I am so sorry. Please forgive me, Ratna. I don't want to lose you again, Ratna. No. I promise I will never leave you again. I swear to God. I'm sorry. It's me. It's me who should say sorry. I love you, Ratna. Ateng, Agung. Come here. - Don't ever leave me again. - Never, Ateng, Agung. Cemplon... Now it's time for you and I... - Okay, ready? - Ready. Come on. Iskak, don't forget to take the cap off. That's what a life partner is for, Master. To remind us. Okay, ready? Ateng, hug your mom. One, two... Cemplon, I don't have a picture of me with Ateng. - Please take our picture. - Let me do it. Ateng, let's take a picture together. Let's do it while we have a beautiful photographer. Are you ready, Cemplon? One, two... Change the pose now. One, two...
