Stand back, Michael ! I'm tired of this shit ! This is my honeymoon ! My special day I dreamt about all my entire life, when everything was finally supposed to be perfect ! When I wear my new nightie and drink champagne... And have a candlelit dinner for two at some ritzy hotel on a white sand beach... In some third world country where jealous little peasants stare up at me... Like I was a goddamn queen ! So back off ! I'm calling the cops. Valeri. What ? The phone is dead. And we can't go to the police. Why not ? Because I can't call the cops on my only brother. Oh. So now you're blaming Reggie for this. Reggie doesn't work for the special Olympics. Let me-- let me show you something. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ Look at this. What's this ? Security codes to a vault. The vault those men are planning to Rob. How did those get in there ? What are you saying ? I married a bank robber ? It's a credit union. Are you telling me that everything... Reggie c. Makeshift told me is one big lie ? Even the c. He didn't give up a kidney for that kid in Rhode Island ? You'd probably need a valid driver's license for something like that. He wasn't knighted by prince Harry, televised by CNN ? I think prince Harry's only six. Valeri, it's gonna be okay. I can't believe it's happening again. Tell me it's not happening again. I'm cursed. I'm a black cloud, an evil trinket ! I've been left at the altar by three different men: Two almost died, and one is missing ! I'm sure it's not that. My first wedding was in shadow ranch state park. Just before the ceremony, Josh was mauled by a mountain lion. He ended up marrying the perky little nurse from the emergency room. The bitch was after him from the moment she could find a pulse ! He can't remember asking me to marry him, yet the bastard sure remembers how to walk ! And how to eat soup ! I saw two of my ex-girlfriends on Oprah. One had become a man. The other was dating him. I saw that episode. [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] My last fiance Tony was with me on the cruise two weeks ago. We wanted to get married at sea. But when the captain asked for the "I do's," Tony started to hyperventilate. All of a sudden he just ran across the lido deck, jumped over a few lounge chairs and dove off of the back of the boat. You see, Michael, I destroy every man I fall for. And you met my brother on that cruise ? I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't met Reggie in the bar. He was even more depressed than I was. Reggie was depressed ? He told me about his wife's water-skiing accident and how he'd been driving the boat. He was riddled with guilt. Helpless. We were soul mates in the stormy sea of life. We weren't soul mates in the stormy sea of life ? He didn't accidentally drive his wife into a buoy, did he ? Yes, he did. Right into the buoy. Splat. She will be missed. I can't believe it. I am so stupid. I don't know why I thought I would have a perfect night. A real honeymoon. Valeri, it's gonna be okay. You're gonna get everything you want. You really think so ? Yes, I do. Michael, why didn't you tell me about Reggie in front of the hotel ? Why did you cover for him ? 'Cause you were so happy. I didn't want to be the one to hurt you. I'm sorry. You know something ? You're nothing like your brother. [ Grunting ] Look at this. Hey, stone, can you read the label ? Dry clean or launder ? Shut up. Keep workin'. I can remember six or seven years ago, nobody ate Turkey. Now everybody eats Turkey. Turkey burgers. Right ? Turkey sausage. Hey, I used to eat ham and cheese, man. Not anymore. Now it's Turkey this, Turkey that. [ Tools clanking ] Sometimes I wonder what animal's gonna be next. You know ? Duck. I bet you it's duck. You know how much I wish I could kill you right now ? [ Tools clanking ] Duck's now in the same position... Turkey was in ten years ago. It's like they're in the on-deck circle. Or the on-duck circle. [ Snickers ] [ Giggling ] That's good. On-duck circle. Did you hear that, stone ? Say one more word, candy man, I'm puttin' you in the trunk. I won't say another word. Not another quack. [ Snickers ] [ Reggie ] Come on, guys. Let me outta here ! This trunk is killin' my clothes ! I can help you look for the car. Six eyes are better than four. Actually it's three, not four. What do you mean ? Why three ? Stone has a glass eye. Get outta here ! Which one ? The one that's Navy blue. Drop it. Ooh. Navy blue ! [ Reggie ] Stone, you fashion victim. Gray-- not such a liability. [ Exhales ] You look beautiful. It was for my honeymoon. Come on. There's something I want to show you. I already have an electric sander. [ Chuckles ] Come on. Oh, my stars ! [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] It suddenly occurred to me that you had a wedding with no reception. So. Oh ! How did you do this ? It really wasn't that hard. It's my favorite-- latticework and string lights and a circuit box-- bougainvillaeas ! Couple boxes of tenpenny nails... And a model 358 glue gun with a little-- - maybe it's best if I don't know. - Probably best if you don't. It's really beautiful. Come on. You sit there. Over here. Over there. Would you, uh, like some wine ? You're kidding ! Where'd you get red wine ? I didn't. This is the color of the tap water here in Los Angeles. Cheers. Cheers.

[ Hand thuds ] That's always my favorite part of the wedding: The bride and groom's first dance. Do you ever really look at their faces ? It's like those people are listening to the most wonderful music, and nobody else can hear it. My favorite part's the cake. [ Chuckles ] When I see the bride and groom feeding each other, I lose it every time. This makes you cry, people eating cake ? Mm-hmm. I know it sounds silly, but when I see two people in love with their arms crossed, and about to take that bite-- for that brief moment, it always looks like they're gonna live happily ever after. And I cry. Why ? 'Cause I think I'll never have the chance to taste it. [ Squeaks ] [ Man in distance ] Hey, don't mess with the TV ! [ Yelling ] Sorry ! [ Chuckles ] What are you doing ? What does it look like I'm doing ? This doesn't count ! This is a pity feed ! No, it's not. I really want to feed you. [ Laughing ] This doesn't work this way. Show me how to do it. I danced. All right. All right. Okay, they cross arms like this. Okay. [ Chuckles ] Now what ? Uh, the, uh, band starts the drumroll, and the photographer gets in position-- and then we bite. No ! First you have to whisper something to me. They always whisper just before the bite. What should I say ? Say something romantic. Tell me I don't make you nauseous. [ Whispering ] Valeri, you don't make me nauseous. [ Siren wailing in distance ] What am I doin' ? This is crazy. This is crazy. What do you mean ? The deal is over. Reggie paid me and I did my job... And now I'm leaving. Michael, what did you say ? Nothing. It's been a really rough day. Michael. Have you ever had a broken heart ? A broken heart ? Yes. Every woman that I've ever fallen for has left me. Before valeri, I was crushed by a Lynn. Before Lynn, I was devastated by an Alison, two Debbies, and a Brenda. I've gone through a Josh, a ray, two Tonys, four steves, and a Doug. That's a lot of steves. Do you ever think we'll stop falling in love with the wrong people ? My mother has a theory about that. What's her theory ? Love is shit, valeri. Love is shit, Michael. I'm-- i'm-- I'm gonna go... Sleep in the car. Are you sure ? Yeah ! Positive. - Is that what you want ? - Yeah. I mean, we both know that you belong with Reggie. And we both know you belong with valeri. Well, I'm glad we got that settled. Good night, valeri.

Let them handle this ! - No, I am handling this ! - Captain, I'd like to report a 211 in progress. No shit. What do you think we're doing here ? No, sir, it's not the credit union; It's the stop n' shop next door. [ Man shouting ] I'm not kiddin' around here. The call just came in. There's an armed gunman with a hostage. We better call for backup. [ Officer ] Everybody's already here. Okay, have some of those fellas stand about four feet over. Where should we stand ? I guess somewhere in the middle.
