It was when summer was almost over. It was rainin' a hell of a lot. Do you also fix broken things? I can fix anythin' except makin' a hag into a maiden. Then could you fix this, too? Oh my, you must pack a big punch down there. How hard could you have peed to break that steel bedpan into pieces? When I arrived at her home to bring the fixed bedpan, the rain suddenly stopped. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Who's there? Yes, it's me, the blacksmith you visited down below. How much did you say it cost? Man, I'm so darn coldafter gettin' drenched out there. A drink is better than any money if you got any booze. Don't know if a young maiden living alone like me would have any. I did buy some raw rice wine to make vinegar two days ago. But where could it be? Could it be there? Where could it be? Here? There? Or here? Where could it be? Where is it? Where could it be? Oh boy, her tight butt looked like it was gonna burst. I just wanted to sink my teeth into it. - What? - What the hell? What happened next? - Hurry up. - Quickly. Tell us! - Then she... - Shut up! You low class bastards. I can't concentrate, damn it! What? "Low class bastards"? What? And they aren't? You low class bastards. Try some taffy! Taffy! I got taffy a young widow likes to eat on a lonely night! Taffy that's as white as a baby's thigh. If you have taffy white as a baby's thigh... Then got one as big as my pecker? I got all sizes, some even big as a palace crossbeam. The sun's falling over the mountain, and this taffy is running out fast This booze isn't just booze Drink! It's a potion to make you live forever. Now, come and drink. - Try out a few sips. - Can I use my two nuts as tab? Depending on the nuts. If the piece is solid, drink for free. Thief! Catch him! - Taffy! Come buy some taffy! - Watch where you put your hand! Don't just salivate, come buy some taffy now. I'm gonna break your wrists! Lady, have some taffy. Test it out. Come here. Hey, you have to pay first! - What the hell? - Oh my, I'm sorry. - What are you looking at? - You little... I oughta... Let's go. You're lucky I'm a busy man today. Money! Money! Protect the wagon! Money! Money! Protect the money! I'm a police officer! Freeze! Do or die. Do or die. Do or die. I mean, if you surrender, I'll let you alive! So put that thing down fast and be a good boy. I knew you'd do that. I knew! Don't let a single sack go! That way! Gross! Ouch, that hurt. What blockhead bumped into me? Who the hell? Me? I'm nothin' special. I'm just Detective Namsoon! Now you're completely surrounded. What's a crazy bitch like you doin' here? Go. I said go. I said go. Go. I said go. I said go! - Where is he? - Yes? I said where is he? Where's who? Want a taste of a bitch who's really lost her mind? Where is he? The bald guy with an eye patch. The short, fast-walking one. He's the one you're looking for, right? You know him, too. Right? Pardon? See? Now he puts his tail down since we're talking nice to him. Use your mouth not your fist next time. He's human, not a beast. So beating him won't make him listen! Oh my! How could you do this to him? Anyway, he came this way, so where could he have gone? In the toilet? In the well? On the roof? Well, mind if I ask you who you are? Come on, don't need to be scared! We're not out to check IDs for prostitutes, nor or we out to find liquor illegally stashed away. So don't be scared. Just quickly tell us where he is. We'll go quietly like a silent fart, without you asking us to. All I know is that his name is Eel. That's right. That bastard is so fast he slips away like an eel all the time. Well, his real name can't be Eel, so what is it? You should know already that Ma is one vicious guy. If I open my mouth, he'll stab me! So I can't tell you! Hey, you're trying to send me to Hell, too? I'd like to settle things if we can. So what's his name? Ma the Lizard? So he must run as fast as a lizard. Where does he live? Where he eats and shits all the time. Right, okay. And from there? I know the rest. I've seen a lot of fast fighters, but I haven't seen anyone as fast as him. There's a saying that someone poked a thorn out of a speeding tiger's paw. I guess that kind of person really exists. Unfortunately, we haven't found any clues to the counterfeit incident that erupted today. All probable suspects were killed by that masked man who popped up and vanished. Since not a single person was able to get a good look at his face, it's currently difficult to draw his picture montage. This was picked up in the market during the day. Take a good look at them. At first glance, they look like real money. If you take a closer look, the engraving is very rough. That can happen if the heating is not right. Although it's a hunch, I think... It's really strange. They're not just a few coins... But there are tons... Of fake money circulating... In the capital city... So something's up. First, make sure that none of this leaks out and causes havoc. Make a montage of at least half of that masked man's face, spread it, and probe around in secret. Then something will eventually come up. Who the hell, and for what reason did this person fake so many coins? There's a shitload of fake money goin' around. Prices are gonna reach sky-high. I had a bulk of money, but all I could buy were some eggs. But I heard the money looks real. My money-lovin' big brother can't even tell if it's real or not anymore. can I even do business if I don't know what money's real? Fake money's all over the place, even in my Choonchung Province. Think that's all? Haejoo, Kaesung, Anhdong, Namwon. They're all over the country. If this keeps up, this damn country will go belly up. I still have the right to speak my mind. Son of a bitch, what's he staring at? Oh my, leaving already? Was it tasty? Hey, this money is fake! How dare you accuse me! I just got this money after selling something. Take a good look at it. Can't you read the official seal? You can't even read at all. Yeah, I can't read, so what? Anyway, I can't take this money! Can I take a quick look at it? Oh my, how can a young boy like you be so darn pretty? If only you weren't a boy, I'd have some great fun with you. Oh my, how could your hands be so soft? Oh, how wonderful. If you were younger than me, you'd already be dead. Scram! And your voice is even pretty. I'm gonna crush your balls! Oh no! Namsoon! The money's real! I can never leave you alone for even a minute! I bet it hurts a lot. Let me take a look. Ouch! Each person died from a single strike. I also found out that the dead prosecutors are fakes. Oh boy, fake money circulates, and now fake prosecutors are in it. Goodness, the whole world is filled with fakes. You're not fake so don't worry. Hermit Gongan... Remember? Only Hermit Gongan could make a fake prosecutor's seal like that. Isn't he in Surin Jail? As far as I know, someone paid big money to bail him out. Is that so? Are you absolutely sure you can protect me? We'll even cover the money for your paintings. Is he the one who visited you at Surin Jail a month ago? Yes, sir. His eyes looked quite sad. You sure you got a good look at him? That Sad Eyes or whatever guy? I did! This is where he vanished. There's nowhere else to go. But you know where we are, don't you? The powerful Defense Minister, who can even stop a bird from flyin'. That Minister Song whatever's home. Why'd a powerful official like him hang around those rotten crooks? That's so you. You don't have much of a brain. That's why you were never promoted. What did you bring that up for? That's complete nonsense. I just like to sweat on the job. It means that I like being out on the scene. Well, sometimes you can be right. But I still don't buy what you said. It's really iffy. Corvina fish and Ambrosia casserole! Oh my, it looks so tasty! But nothin' exciting is happening. Is that Sad Eyes? Don't get too close to him. It's not time yet. Oh goodness, my belly! Where are you hurt? Stomachaches... Sir, are you following me because you like me? Are you chasing after me? Don't know what you're saying. Or... Are you tailing me? Oh goodness! Where've you been all this time? Trailed the fallen leaves to here? Or were you drunken by the perfume? Or were you possessed by the night? No one saw us, right? - Yes, sir! - Let's go. I swear it was the Defense Minister's old assistant, Gu Jang-gon. I clearly remember because I served under Minister Song in the last war. They're smarter than I thought. They installed bellows in the boat, made the fake coins while riding in the canal, and also distribute them. The Defense Minister's assistant, you say. These are the fake coins gathered in Pyongyang and Hamheung. Money is also useless there, and prices have skyrocketed. Sir, shall we bring in Gu Jang-gon first? You scared the hell out of me! Where the hell have you been? Anyway, are you alright? Sir, it's impossible to produce the counterfeits in huge sums without aid from the dignitaries. Since Defense Minister Song controls the entire military and has no rivals, I'm sure he's behind everything. Who are you to shoot off your mouth like that? Please let Detective Ahn and me go into Minister Song's home. We will definitely find evidence. You have good intentions, but we could fall first if we're too hasty. But sir! Why aren't you sleeping? Are you trying to put me on a skewer or something? You know that you're done for if you weaken before a fight, right? A fight only comes one time around. There's no second chance. That's Minister Song's old assistant, Gu Jang-gon. Your Excellency, I wish you a happy birthday. This a famous sword brought over from Japan. It was made for the Prime Minister during the Muromachi era. They also say that a curse comes with this sword. According to its curse, the sword's maker was executed. The Prime Minister, who held this sword, was eventually assassinated by his men. The sword disappeared for centuries and was then found at the Prime Minister's grave. Strangely, it wasn't rusted and was perfectly in tact. Quite an interesting sword. A sword like that suits the Minister perfectly! Yes indeed! They say those kinds of swords become a lucky sword to powerful men. Of course. Nazukusa. Zuwamonodomoka Yumenoato. The summer grass, traces of a vanished warrior's dream. Jeez, I guess this ain't the toilet. Oh boy, this place is as big as a palace. I was told the way, but I can't find the toilet. Oh my, I peed on myself. You all scared me to death. Your Excellency, could we see an example of the sword's power here? Great idea! Yes, please show us! Strike me if you like. If you don't trust me. Your Excellency! How about giving him this girl as a prize? That's a great idea! Your loyal henchman seems to be very interested in this girl. Hurry and pour him a drink! Drinks aren't important now! She better go wash up first! Oh no! What is your name? Nam! Namsoon... I mean, Sweet Flower Moon. Then what's your name? Sir... Well... What? We've met before, haven't we? There are three things we can't foresee how they'll change. One is a cat's eye. Another is the sky's color in late fall. And the last is a woman's face. I was a loony to teach a young kid how to fight long ago. What am I gonna do about her now? You didn't like that girl? I should've sent you another girl. You have to learn how to rest. An instrument may make no sound if the strings are always tense. Why'd you come here instead? I took a walk to sober up. I hope I'm not interfering. You were just a kid when you first came here. Time sure flies. Having it hard lately? Seems like you are since you're so quiet. Since I have a sword with me, how about a duel for old time's sakes? In the sutra, there's a story about a man shot by a poisoned arrow. What would you do? If someone was shot by that arrow, you'd swiftly take it out and suck out the poison if you want to save him, right? But someone once said, Finding out who shot the arrow is more important. People agreed and looked for him while neglecting the wounded. Meanwhile, what do you think happened to the poisoned man? Right now, this whole country is the same as that poisoned man. But all the high statesmen, who are also like the trash that came to my feast, are blabbering how they'll save our country. They're just casually arguing over where the arrow came from in front of the dying man. I think I left a difficult job to you. It worries me all the time. Namsoon, in my opinion, whether he steals an apple or a chicken, a thief is a thief. Whether the person's young, old, a man, woman, or pretty-looking like a gigolo, if they've done bad things, then they're a bad person. I've looked in every nook and cranny for bastards like them, and have put them into jail all my freakin' life. Well, by any chance... - Well... - Well what? What are you yelling at me for? Shut up out there! Well, then forget about it. I'm just feeling sad that you look so down. Those stars sure do look pretty. Don't you think? Yup. But did you just say "yup"? Yup. Please, just for once. When will you ever address me as "sir"? People will think that I didn't teach you anything. I think I left a difficult job to you. - Then what's your name? - It worries me all the time. I'm Sweet Flower Moon. Doctor! What are you doing under a married woman's belly? What do you think? I'm just stroking her belly because she feels sick, - you dummy. - You melt taffy and omen with your tongue. But yours melted too much. Nothing's left. What a waste. We're almost there. Good job. It's money you told me you needed. If the deal goes through today, we'll definitely seal some evidence. So don't wait for Detective Ahn's team and go take a rest. You probably haven't been home for days. Sir, we'll be going now. How about some hot soup first? Have this at least on the way. I'm telling you this story's true! Thanks for the drink. Wait, you should pay instead for listening to my story! Hold on! Damn it, this sucks! But I'm totally broke. It's freezing like hell! I'm sorry. Autumn seemed like just yesterday, but it's snowing already? Since the country is in turmoil, so is the damn weather. Have you seen a pretty girlish-looking guy, and a middle-aged man wearing a hat? Can I also have a hot soup here? A really steamy one. If I'm supposed to meet Namsoon here, then she should be on time. You brought the money, right? No one tailed you, right? What are you talking about? If the stuff is real, then we can pay more for it. Red hot chili pepper, please. Hot as Namsoon's temper. Looks delicious. Scram! Cut it off! Who cares if you cut off my hand! Minister of Home Affairs, how about giving up? He has no guts to overturn the game. He's just like our king. The rich are busy hoarding goods in this counterfeit-ridden country. The poor are becoming homeless and turn into thieves. All our country's scholars are begging the king to act, but he's being hesitant like the Home Affairs Minister. Now, once the ast piece is laid down, all we have left is a big celebration, right Minister Song? Who are you looking for? Move! How dare you! I told you to move. I'm very pissed, you see. So I could just kill someone. You. You. You! I'm a crazy bitch. For seeing a beast like you as a real person even for a moment makes me a crazy bitch. You rotten bastard! Are you ignoring me? Freeze! I said freeze! You dare try to run away? Look at you. Looking like some pretty pansy. I knew what you were all along. I knew it! - Please leave. - To where? Over here? Over there? That way? Over there? That way? You can't go! You can't go alone! Fine then. Stab me! Come and stab me! You hit me? Fine. Let's settle this once and for all. You and me! Die! Stop! Oh boy. Trying to teach me some Confucius? Now you wanna be courteous about it? Say it. Please say it. Say it. Say that it wasn't you. That you didn't do anything. You rotten bastard! It's me! It's me, Detective Namsoon! Take your hands off now! You've gone on a rampage, but have you delivered anything? You get valuable sources killed, and cause havoc in useless places. Detective Ahn, go on patrol duty with your wonderful partner! But sir. That's all I have to say! But chief. Turn your badges in this instant! Namsoon, this could turn out to be a good thing. We can go around on patrol like this, eat three meals a day, have some long rests at home, and get paid better than now, don't you think? Okay! Let's drink our sorrows away! Namsoon! We passed by the pub already. You know another place? There isn't a decent place this way. Where the hell are you goin'? This doesn't look like a pub. What trouble are you gonna make now? Oh goodness. Perfect timing. Chief, when you waved your three fingers, Detective Ahn noticed that it meant 3 o'clock. Like rumors have it, the court's using the counterfeit ordeal to take down the young king. Of course the next king will be his stepbrother. Minister Song is trying to marry his daughter off to that prince. This is the real aim behind the counterfeits. But he needs tons of copper to make all that fake money, right? Then I'm sure that the documents for this deal is inside Minister Song's home. That's what we must find instead of bellows and copper plates. We don't have enough time. I put my faith in you two. If you don't trust me, you can stab me right now. Only if you think I plotted this whole thing for my own personal greed. Remember how you tried to stab me with this sword? On my birthday? I loved you. Always, like a son. Although I've agreed, stealing the Minister's account book from his house is like jumping into the fire. But there's gotta be a way somehow. Only if someone on the Minister's side could help us... Thank you for coming. The reason you asked to meet wasn't because you liked me. And to fight, this isn't the right place for it. What's your real name, Sweet Flower Moon? Me? Namsoon! You wanted to see me just to ask my name? Namsoon. It's a pretty name. Much better than Sweet Flower Moon. Pretty, my butt. Everyone says it sounds dumb. So what's your name? I really like how you look when you get surprised. At first, it was scary. Are you making fun of me? Or are you mocking me? You keep snickering. Sorry for yelling. But you should act like a real man. I bought this because it looked pretty. Stealing the Minister's account book from his house is like jumping into the fire. But there's gotta be a way somehow. There are those who we meet by fate, and there are those that are not. Namsoon. You didn't think something unimaginable like this would ever happen to you, right? Move. Tell me where you're going. Move. Or don't go anywhere at all. Move! Pull yourself together! You're a cop! A damn cop! By the king's order! Minister Song Pil-joon, you are under arrest! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! Was it you? Did you do it? Yes. It's been a long time since I called you by your name. Your name is... My name is... My name is... What did you say your name was? My name is... The summer grass, traces of a vanished warrior's dream. Cut the crap! Reciting a poem on your way to Hell? Go recite that crap to my dead cop friends after you die. Yeah. That's your true face. But, do or die. If you surrender, then I won't slice your throat. Namsoon. He died. No. No. He can't die! Sir, are you following me because you like me? Are you chasing after me? Or... Are you tailing me? I had something I really wanted to tell you. It was last winter. Don't know whether I was possessed by the moonlight or the snow. I was on my way to a friend's house with a bottle of booze. And a man and a woman were fighting like crazy with some sharp swords. But they also looked like they were dancing. It was like they were making love under the moonlight as well. While I was watching them, I came. Then what? What happened next? I don't know either. I wasn't even drunk or even dreaming at the time. They just vanished all of a sudden. - Come on. - Come on. - You're lying again. - You're lying again. No, I'm telling the truth this time.
