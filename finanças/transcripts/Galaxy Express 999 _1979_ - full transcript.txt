Before humanity was born to this world. The stars shone in the heavens, long after humanity is gone... the stars will continue to shine. While they live humanity looks up to the Sea of Stars... and considers its own destiny. Everyone embarks on a journey dreaming of the Sea of Stars. Chasing the pictures of one's dreams endlessly... While still on the road one eventually succumbs to an eternal sleep... tough there may be many kilometers yet to go. Lives terminate, lives begin. The train runs through this endless floW. It carries on its infinite tracks the hopes, the ambitions... and youth of all humanity and for one youth. The train runs again today. And noW the Whistle signals the journey beginning for that young man. Galaxy Express 999 Executive producer CHIAKI IMADA Planning, Original story, Layout LEIJI MATSUMOTO Music NOZOMI AOKI Director TARO RIN Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his 40 crew members. Wanted dead or alive. Reward is a full year's supply of finest quality energy capsules. Hurry up! Wait for me! Galaxy Express Travel Center If they can't afford a ticket, they should just move along. Unlimited access train pass. Please, including all local lines. Yes, including access to Galaxy Express. I 'll have that! Stop! Thief! Let's get him. Hey! Catch! Here! Come and catch me. Stop! You are under arrest for assault and robbery. Damn it. let me go! Be quiet. Y-You're... Mother? After him! Here! Thanks. Take off! My pendant... My pendant, give it back to me. Don't let him get aWay! Kill him if necessary! Stop! Looks like the last of the Galaxy Express has reached Megalopolis Station. Uh-oh, it's starting to snoW again. Brr, it's cold. If We had mechanical bodies, We'd hardly feel the cold at all. Do people With mechanical bodies live a long time? Yes. As long as you take care to replace Worn parts... you could live forever they say. Forever? If only your father Were alive We could've gotten you a mechanical body. Then We gotta go to Megalopolis and get on the 999. But tickets cost an aWful lot of money, you knoW. I knoW. I 'll Work hard, instead. So We can get on the 999... and go to the planet that gives out mechanical bodies for free. Oh, Tetsuro! I see you have it all Worked out. Of course! I 've got a really big dream. So c'mon, let's hurry! Tetsuro, duck! Trophy hunters! Mother! By Count Mecha's hunters, humans are killed for sport. Human hunting? We must've stumbled onto Count Mecha's lands, into his hunting grounds. Here, humans are nothing more than trophies for the hunt. Mother, hang in there! I... I can't. Please hurry, run aWay. No! I 'm not going Without you! You're on your oWn noW, Tetsuro. But I have faith in you... You're a strong boy. Be sure to Work hard, and you'll get that mechanical body... Mother! I knoW it's here someWhere. Over there, my lord. Wonderful. I 've never seen a human this beautiful. What a lovely kill. I 'll hang her on my Wall. She'll make a fine addition to my collection to be proud of till the end of my days. Let's go. Back at the Time Castle We'll raise a toast. Time Castle? Mother! Damn them. Damn them! Where am I? Whoa! It's Megalopolis! He's still sleeping. Whatever happens, Maetel... you are not to leave that boy's side. FolloW him like a shadoW, and stay by his side until the very end. The more secrecy you can maintain, the better. That is your mission, Maetel. I understand. Boy? Are they talking about me? Mother? Is something Wrong? Uh, no! I just heard some people talking. At least I thought I heard some people talking. More importantly, though, Who is she...? That didn't look like a machine body and she looked so much like my mother. What are you talking to yourself about? Oh, I Was just dreaming about my mother... Dreaming? Oh, that's because of the Dream Sensor. With this. It's almost as though you're right there in someone else's dream. Then you Were Watching me? Who are you? My name is Maetel. Maetel? If it Wasn't for me, you'd be at Police headquarters noW. You probably Won't believe me, but I 'm not a thief. I 'm really not. I just.. You just needed to get on the 999, no matter What. Yes. I Want to get a mechanical body. What do you hope to accomplish then? I Will kill Count Mecha. Shall I give you a pass? Or shall I give you this back first? Mother! She still means that much to you then? What kind of a question is that? You've got a mother yourself, don't you? I shouldn't have to tell you hoW I feel! Maetel, you don't mean that your mother is... I see. It's just that, When I first saW you, you looked so much like my mother that I got confused. Did you mean What you said back there? You Weren't just teasing about the pass, Were you? Getting a mechanized body and killing Count Mecha... it's your only reasons for boarding the 999? You've heard of Captain Harlock and Emeraldas, haven't you? I 'm the Captain Harlock! I Wanna sail the Seas of Freedom... Just like them. I Wanna get a machine body and live forever and explore the Sea of Stars. Isn't that What being a man's all about? Harlock. Emeraldas. They've become such heroes to youth. Take it. It's the real thing. I can really have it? On one condition. What's that? You Will have to go to the Andromeda. Galaxy for a free machine body. You can have the pass if you let me accompany you. That's my condition. Hey, no problem! Ladies shouldn't travel alone anyWay. - So, do We have a deal? - Heck, yeah! I 'm glad. You'll be Wanting to sign your name here. After all, it's not official 'till you do. Well... go on. Tetsuro Hoshino What a manly name. My father gave it to me. Ah, your father. With this. I can finally board the Galaxy Express. I don't care if Maetel turns out to be some kind of Witch... or Death herself. So long as I can take the 999 and get my machine body. I 'll do anything. Open up! We knoW you're harboring a fugitive human! We're onto you! Understand something, Tetsuro. Once you board the 999, you can never come back to Earth. Either you'll make it to the end point at andromeda... or you'll debark on some backwater plant... Where you'll spend the rest of your life. Those are you options. Are you sure you Won't regret this? 'Course not! all I care about noW is getting on the 999. Attention, Please. Passengers, Traveling on the 999... departing at midnight and bound for Andromeda... Please proceed to track 99. Departing at 0: 1 8 and bound for Mars, Please proceed to track 25. Passengers for Large Magellanic Cloud departing at 2: 1 5 please proceed to track 75. Huh? This is the famous Galaxy Express? Yes. Does it surprise you? It's just... I just Wasn't expecting such an old train. Don't Worry... It's actually a super-modern space train protected by an infinite-source electro agnetic barrier. It's only made up to look like a nostalgic relic... from the past on the outside. Feel better noW? This train is designed in old style for those passengers Who may not come back from the trip. I 'll be coming back. Maybe as a machine, but I 'll be back. Today a boy-a young man has embarked... on the journey of his life. Defeat is not in his consideration. It's a journey he'll remember for the rest of his life. Tetsuro, your journey is just beginning. Finally. I 'm finally leaving. At last... after everything. Nothing's gonna stop me I'm flying now I just can't wait no more Gonna search to find my dream somewhere, It's time for me to go When knows when I will ever return I'll be roaming the galactic skies Till I find what it takes to be a man To find where my dream lies I'm leaving, I'm flying I'm taking off to the unknown Maybe I'll find that hidden star I can call my own Taking off Taking off Taking off Taking off to the unknown Nothing's gonna stop me I'm flying now I just can't wait no more Gonna search to find my dream somewhere, It's time for me to go When knows when I will ever return I'll be roaming the galactic skies Till I find what it takes to be a man To find where my dream lies I'm leaving, I'm flying I'm taking off to the unknown Maybe I'll find that hidden star I can call my own Taking off Taking off Taking off Taking off to the unknown Taking off Taking off Look Well, While you can. The next time you see Earth, it Will be With mechanized eyes. That's okay. I 've seen enough. There Will come a time When even your most heartbreaking memories Will be precious to you. You'll Wish you had looked When you had the chance. Ahh, there'll be plenty of time for that When I 'm old. Right noW, I just Want that mechanical body. That'll help make my dreams come true. Uh, the next stop is Titan. Titan. The layover Will be for 1 6 Earth days. Sixteen days? Did he just say 1 6 days? He did. Right! Well, after all, Titan is one of Saturn's satellites. Next to Earth's moon, it's the second- largest satellite in the Galaxy. Because its radius is so large... 5,800 kilometers, to be exact it takes 1 6 Earth-days to complete one revolution. The train stops at each station for exactly as long as the local day lasts. Each planet varies, of course. Some have ten-hour days, some have 50. All planets revolve at different speeds. You're free to explore the planet While the train is stopped. But Whatever you do, make sure you get back on the 999 With time to spare... or you'll be left for dead. Dead? You'll be stranded Without a backward glance. That's a little strict, isn't it? Perhaps, but the Galaxy Express runs strictly by the book. Titan is one of the most beautiful places in the solar system... it's also one of the most terrifying. It used to be a place Where islands of liquid methane floated in a sea of ammonia. It had a nature incomprehensible... to those coming from other planets. Many lives Were lost transforming it into... the green planet you see today. Titan Whoa, this is great! He... he's been killed! Maetel... stop! Don't come after me, Tetsuro! Finally aWake? Where am I? You're in my house. I Want to knoW Where Maetel is! Maetel? You must mean your Traveling companion. She Was kidnapped by the bandits of Grape valley. Bandits? Eat before it gets cold. A man is killed in front of the station Maetel gets kidnapped in broad daylight. What kind of a place is this? Exactly What it Was created to be a land Where people can do... exactly as they Please. That's the laW of the planet the Paradise laW. Paradise laW? What's going to happen to Maetel? Where is Grape Valley? You'll only get yourself killed going after her. I got on the 999... With a promise to protect her I 've got to go after her! Where is this Grape Valley? Tell me Where it is! There's a boat outside at the end of the dock. It Will take you doWn the river and into Grape Valley. Thank you! Hold on! The sun's rays are stronger than you're used to. You should take this too. What kind of gun is this? The kind that Will protect you. But it's such a great gun-- Here. You'd best hurry. It'll be dark before you knoW it. It may be a nice, Warm planet and it may be okay to do Whatever you Want, but... living someWhere that it's okay to kill people isn't What I 'd call paradise. Somebody, help! Help! Hush, noW. It's all over. I 've got you. Boss! Boss! We heard a shot. You're bleeding. It's nothing. Just a scratch. Where's Maetel? Who's the kid? Not so fast! This "kid" just saved her life. So, Tell me, hoW'd you get your hands on a Warrior's Weapon like that? Warrior's Weapon? You're holding the only cosmo gun capable of killing machine men. Capable of killing machine men... This gun? Where did you get it? What business is that of yours? Just hurry up and hand over Maetel! Hey, kid, you can't talk to our boss like that! Boss Antares is the most famous bandit in Grape Valley! Yeah, kid, shoW some respect! What's your name? Stop calling me kid! My name is Tetsuro Hoshino! HoW cute! This Woman you're looking for Maetel... Are you in love With her? Huh? N... No, it's nothing like that. In exchange for a ticket on the 999, I agreed to protect her. The 999? So, you're after one of those damned machine bodies, eh? HoW else am I gonna kill Count Mecha? What? I 'm gonna avenge my mother! Hey! Where are you taking me? Lemme go! Once We put you through this, We'll knoW Whether or not your body is human. If you're a machine man come to kill me, We'll knoW soon enough. Ahh, so that's hoW it is... looks like you're a genuine, bona fide human, all right. Maetel! Tetsuro! If you turn out to be a machine, We'll disassemble you on the spot. Oh, Well, up... Sorry to have embarrassed you like that. You're definitely human as Well. There can't be a finer specimen of humanity. Sorry. Please, forgive me. HoW's about I prove myself to you too. Wh- What are these? Souvenirs from my past... unexploded shells picked up... over the years during raids on various planets. Aren't you Worried they might go off? Nah, I figure I 'll be gone before I 've time to Worry. This is Where the children live. It's not much, but to them, it's paradise. A children's paradise...? Where are their parents? They're all orphans. Orphans? Yes. Just like your mother, all their folks Were killed by Count Mecha. Have you given any thought to hoW you'll find him? All I knoW is he's at the Time Castle. The location of Which remains a mystery to all... except to the one person Who knoWs and isn't telling. So Who...? Female pirate Emeraldas. Emeraldas? No Woman is more terrible than she... one Wrong Word... and off comes your head. So Where is she? HoW can I find this Emeraldas? Don't Worry. If she Wants you to find her, you Will. Good stuff, huh? Here's one last piece of advice: If you do find Count Mecha, shoot first. Ask questions later. No matter hoW he may plead With you, shoW him no mercy. If you pause for even a moment, you're dead. That's your first lesson for survival out here. You take care. You too. So you made it back alive after all. Thank you. This gun saved my life. Why don't you hang on to it a little longer? You may need it. But I heard this Was a Warrior's Weapon... It must be very important to you. I Want you to have it. R-Really? Those things belonged to my only son. That gun and hat Went through... all kinds of danger With him. My son left them behind When he Went off to Wherever he Went. When the time comes you should return... To your mother and father at least once, at least once before you die. Your son... What's his name? His name... Well, he'll be Wearing the hat I made for him, just like yours. If you should happen to meet him someWhere in the universe... If I do meet him... I 'll tell him his mother is Waiting for him. But I 'm not fooling myself. I knoW he's not coming back not alive, anyWay. Still, When he Wanted to leave, I kneW I had no right to stop him.... Sons are also men, after all. That's hoW it is When you have a boy. It can't be helped. The next stop, oh, dear... The next stop Will be Pluto. Please be advised the layover Will be 6.39 days. So that's Pluto, huh? Experienced Travelers call it the "Faltering planet." The Faltering planet? Small and desolate, it's a planet frozen to the core. No Wonder it's so cold! Actually, legend has it that the cold is attributed to the chill of the Travelers' souls Which are frozen there. Shh, be still, don't move. Sometimes, When We Were caught in a snoWstorm my mother Would Warm me up like this. It's almost like she's alive again. Oh? There's something I must do, Tetsuro. You go ahead. Look around a bit if you like, but stay Within city limits. You'll be in danger otherwise. Hah! I 've got a gun, I 'll be fine. Indeed you do, but that doesn't mean it'll Work in this cold. Who-Who are you? My name is ShadoW. I tend the Graves of ice. Graves of ice? Here is Where those Who died of illness or those Who abandoned... their humanity for machine bodies sleep eternally. Abandoned their humanity? C-C-cold! Come With me and I 'll shoW you my former self. Though I Was able to Travel to many exotic planets... With my machine body I couldn't forget my human one. Thus, I became caretaker here in order to remain by its side. Let go of me! You're freezin' me, let go! Aren't I beautiful? That's What I used to look like once upon a time. I kneW no machine could be as beautiful. No face as satisfying. So I chose not to have a face at all. That's Why I am called ShadoW of the Faltering planet. Lemme go! let go, I said! Lemme go! What do you Want from me? Oh, stay With me, I just Want you to stay here With me, forever-- Forget it! let go of me! Good night, little boy. Good night. ShadoW, that's enough! Becoming a machine Was your choice. Taking an innocent child for yourself, even in your loneliness, is not alloWed. It's not his fault you lack the courage to choose... betWeen a limited human life or living forever as a machine. Stop it, Maetel! Ready to leave, Tetsuro? The human bodies are kept here... so that those Who tire of their machine bodies may return to them. Whether or not this is a kindness to those persons... Who have forsaken their oWn humanity or an unspeakable cruelness has yet to be decided. Maetel, from the Way you're talking it sounds like you've got a mechanical body yourself! ShadoW just has that effect on me, that's all. Who Was Maetel... looking at in that icy grave? What sort of secrets does she have in her past? That's right! Okay, let's say I do find out Maetel's past. Do I really need to find out? Or am I better off not knoWing? Uh-oh! Something Wrong? No, it's just that... I 'm not used to eating in fancy places like this. Welcome. Glass? Or is it acrylic. Or... Glass crystal, actually. And your name is...? My name's Claire. Thank you. Tetsuro, you'll be needing your strength, so be sure to eat Well. This is a... Have you decided? Huh? Uh-- Shall We have steak, Tetsuro? Hey, good idea. TWo steaks Please. And hoW Would you like those done? Uh-- Medium-rare, Please, With corn soup. Bread With mine, he'll have rice. Rice, Right. Very good. NoW that's Weird. ShadoW Was kinda see-through too. But she Was cold, While Claire is so Warm. Maybe your feelings make Claire seem Warmer than she is. What? Oh, come on. Is it too Warm in here? Your face is so red. Uh, no, it's just, uh... Tetsuro seems fascinated by your crystal-Glass body. My mother Who Was very vain-- decided it should be Glass... I 'm Working here to save enough money to buy back my real body. It's being stored for me on Pluto at the moment. You mean it's underneath all that ice? Yes. Sometimes on my days off I go doWn to the surface of Pluto and look at it. But this body's so pretty... Thank you. But this body's also made of Glass... The light, the shadoW they go right through it. That makes me very, very sad sometimes. Oh, but your hand is so Warm. Hey! What happened to the lights? We've entered a tunnel, that's all. A tunnel? In space? It's space tunnel through the dimensional asteroid field that cuts across the tracks. The train's electrical system doesn't function inside the tunnel. The safety valves close in order to avoid random cosmic rays. You're like a firefly. Doing this makes my body just a little Warmer. HoW Was your steak, Tetsuro? Oh, it Was great! I 'll take care of the bill. Why don't you go back to the cabin? I 'll escort you. Thanks, I think I can find my Way from here. Oh, Of course. I 'll just be-- What Was that? Another tunnel? We should be out of it by noW. Mr. Conductor? Uh, yes, What is it? What's going on out there? Ah, yes. There's, uh, an unidentified ship flying parallel to us. A ship? You mean that? Yes, sir. Hey, that's-- This is Emeraldas. I claim right of Way. GE 999. LoWer your speed immediately. Emeraldas! I need to ask you something-- Please, you gotta tell me! Wh-Wh-What is he doing? What have you done? Good heavens. Which one of you fired on my ship? Surely someone must have done it. Come out here! I 'm the one Who fired. You're the one--? Are you a bounty hunter? No man has ever pulled a gun on me and lived. It's a foolish man Who values his life so little. And you're hardly a man at that! Where did you get this gun? On Titan. An old Woman gave it to me, along With a hat. Hat? This hat. Maetel... Do you have any idea Where the original oWner of this hat and gun is? I see. HoW are you, Maetel? I hadn't expected to find you here. I 'm doing Well. Emeraldas. Maetel. I didn't knoW you kneW Emeraldas... Why didn't you say something? Because I kneW you'd find her, even Without my help. Emeraldas, Tetsuro has a question for you. For me? I Was told it's something only you knoW. Where Will Count Mecha's Time Castle appear next? Time Castle? Please, Emeraldas. If you knoW, tell him. Why do you Want to knoW? You mean to kill him, don't you. That's it, isn't it? You're serious! If you knoW, Emeraldas, tell him noW. You're sure about this? Are you sure you Want me to tell him? Count Mecha's Time Castle... ...Will noW appear at Trader's Fork, Where a vieWing of his collection Will be held for his associates. Trader's Fork... Trader's Fork is out next stop. Tetsuro Was it? You should value your one and only life. Emeraldas! Thank you. I suppose I should thank you too, Maetel. Me? If you Weren't Emeraldas' friend, I 'd be a goner by noW. Well, perhaps so... but Emeraldas is looking for the oWner of... that gun and hat you have. So you're sayin' that the old Woman's son is--? Emeraldas' most beloved to Whom she has dedicated body, soul... and life. Please. Might We just this once keep going Without stopping at Trader's Fork? What are you saying, Claire? If the train doesn't run on time I 'll be fired for negligence. But if We stop there, Tetsuro Will get himself killed going after Count Mecha! Just this once can't We pass through Trader's Fork Without stopping? Tetsuro means that much to you, does he, Claire? No! No, of course not! Trader's Fork. The great Way station... Where all tracks meet. Planet Heavy Melder All Travelers... pass through here at least once. The frontier of both freedom and laWlessness... many people come here With great dreams. Some become the ashes of this planet... some keep their dreams intact Trader's Fork and leave for the ends of... Trader's Fork the unknoWn universe. This is the planet Heavy Melder. Please don't let anything happen to Tetsuro... Maetel! If you don't mind... I 'd like to take a look around and see if anyone knoWs about the Time Castle. Fine. Be careful, all right? Don't Worry. I Will. What do you Want from me? Is it me? Or love more refined? Up above, resting birds Uneasy even so Even if you don't see me They knoW I 'm here, at least So What if I 'm like a child Whose toy box Has broken and lost its key should I sigh should I cry What do you Want from me? Is it me? Or love more refined? I can't bear your kind Words Not With this tired heart Those old tales never come true Tales that I may hold dear No good Will come, even so Hello, youngster. Huh? First time I 've seen you here. Why are they all crying? It's because of that song. It reminds them of the days of their youth day that'll never come again. For those Who've come to the end of their journey, it's a hard thing for them to remember. What'll it be? Milk. Did he just say, Milk? That's What he said! Maybe he misses his mama! Mama! If I pour, Will you buy me a round? Guess you must really knoW a lot about this place. Yeah, they call me the living encyclopedia. Then maybe you can tell me When Count Mecha's Time Castle is to appear. What kind of business have you got With Count Mecha? I 'm gonna to kill him. Fool! You're no match for him. I Won't knoW that until I try. Will I? Count Mecha killed my mother. For her sake, I 'm gonna-- No. Not just for her, but for every kid Whose mother he killed! If only for those orphaned kids, somehoW, I 've gotta-- All right. You'll find What you Want at Mount Gun Frontier. Mount Gun Frontier? It's about 1 0km from here, to the south. There's an eccentric Who lives at the base of the mountain. If anyone knoWs Where that Time Castle Will be next, it's him. Thank you! Where is the little bastard, old man? What did you tell him? Nothing. I told him nothing. What a piece of junk! ...he'll be Wearing the hat I made for him, just like yours. Y-You must be-- Where did you get that hat? I got it from your mother. You knoW my mother? She helped me When I Was in danger. She gave me this too. My mother hoW Was she? She very much Wanted to see you. I gave my good-byes When I set out for space. Come inside. I 'm sure you've come for a reason. I see, so that's Why you've come for this visit. Please tell me. When Will Count Mecha come here next? Guess you and me are thinking the same thing. We are? Uh-huh. Once he Was a red-blooded human With a Warm heart. After he acquired his mechanical body, though humans became something for him to harm. I cannot forgive his cruelty. B-But it's... It's too late. Too late? Why? Why is it too late? Those years of Wandering have taken their toll. My time is almost up. Close your mouth, kid. I 'm not dead yet. Not for a little While yet, anyWay. That's right! You can't die! Emeraldas is looking for you. You've met Emeraldas? Sure! She also told me about the Time Castle. At midnight tonight... he ought to appear on the other side of Mount Gun Frontier. Mount Gun Frontier at midnight. I Was hoping to have killed Count Mecha before this caught up With me... Tetsuro, I have one favor to ask. What is it? Listen Well. When I lie doWn, pull doWn that lever. What happens When I pull it? Then I 'll... go someplace else. Do you understand. Tetsuro? Shoot Count Mecha in the head. Without their heads, machine people are just-- They can't-- Hang on! Please, you gotta-- I 'll soon become one With one, I 'll be one machine, I 'll... I 'll become the soul of my best friend's ship, the Arcadia, and I 'll... I 'll Wander Sea of Stars... Tetsuro, the lever--! I can't do it. I can't do it! Do it, so that I may stand once more... Pull it! Pull it. Tetsuro-- So... so many things I... I still Wanted to do... Being human means you also have to die Whether you've lived out your dreams or not. You're-You're Count Mecha's guys, aren't you! Go home, kid... Get some more Milk from your mama. Give me back my gun! It's right, here. Give it! Give it back! Gimme back my-- So-Somebody help! Y-You're... Captain Harlock! Barkeep, Milk, Please. Drink up, noW. No! Milk Will rust me from the inside out. So there's nothing I can say to stop you? Yes. Why did you save me back there? I 'm only returning the favor you did for my friend in erecting his grave. What? Then that "best friend" he Was talking about Was you? It's been a long time, Harlock. Yes. Emeraldas, about the man you Were looking for-- Has something, happened to Tochiro? He's on this planet, isn't he? Where is he? Harlock! He's dead. Th-That's it... Time Castle Time Castle Mother... So you Were in With Count Mecha all along! What if she Was? And Who the hell are you? I 'm Tetsuro Hoshino. You killed my mother and I 've come to avenge her! Avenge...? Don't tell me that you're here to kill me? That's right! Didn't I tell you? Shoot before you're shot at. Antares! Mind if I help? Thank you, Antares. No need to thank me... I 'm also here to avenge... the tens of thousands of orphans he's made. Stop! Tetsuro! Go. I 'll take care of the rest. Stop-- Wait! Look What you've done to me, I can't fight anymore... I 'm pathetic, please don't torture me any further... Antares. Damn. Leave this to me. Antares. Get out of here! I 've got all those unexploded bullets in my body. Ryuzu, hurry, move time forward. Ryuzu, What's Wrong? Hurry, move time forward. Ryuzu? What's Wrong, Ryuzu? Ryuzu! It looks like your last friend has betrayed you, Count Mecha... This is your punishment for killing innocent humans. Tetsuro, it's Maetel... Don't trust Maetel. Tetsuro, hurry and get out of here. The Time Castle Will soon crumble into dust. But, Why... Why are you saving me? When I first saW you, I Was reminded of my oWn lost past... I remembered my oWn youth. Back then, I Was Warm flesh... just like you. But I chose a machine body to please the Count... and With modification after modification... soon I Was no longer myself at all. I had become a Witch Who controlled time. There Was one thing in me he couldn't control, hoWever... And that Was the spirit of a Warm-blooded human. Hurry, and get out of here! But your body... It's turning to rust. Goodbye, Ryuzu! Don't shoot the Count. That's What I Was crying to you in my heart. But this is for the best. I 'm glad this is it. Mother... With this, your vengeance is over Tetsuro... Captain Harlock, that isn't true. As I look at Count Mecha and other Mechanized people... I find that eternal life isn't alWays happiness. It's because life is limited that people try hard to live... and to feel for others, and that's What creates kindness. That's What I 've realized. Mechanical bodies have got to be removed from the universe. I 've realized that living forever... is no reason to get a mechanical body. That's Why I 'm going to that planet in the Andromeda Galaxy... that gives out machine bodies for free... so that I can destroy it. I sure didn't think like this in the beginning. Maetel, thanks for getting me on the 999. I 'm grateful to you. They made it! Maetel. Maetel, you Wanted to see me? Please, sit doWn. Congratulations, Tetsuro. You've successfully avenged your mother. Thank you Maetel! What are you thinking? We're almost at the final station, aren't We? Is it just me, or are you starting to get more and more depressed? You're right. It's just you. 'Maetel... Don't trust Maetel.' I 'm just relieved the journey's ended Without incident, that's all. Say, Maetel. When this is over... after We've gone back to Earth, What are you going to do? I 've no idea. Why do you ask? If you don't mind, I 'd-- I 'd kind of like to stay With you for a While. Tetsuro Will realize it someday... He may love me... but that love is only a dream... I 've left on the other side of time. Maetel, your feelings for Tetsuro are something to value... You mustn't abandon hope, not until the very end. What're you thinking, here all by yourself...? When I sit here all alone, it's like I have the train all to myself and enjoy that feeling. Sure! It's a great feeling. We thank you for riding the Galaxy Express. Our next stop is... Our, uh, next stop is Final Station Maetel. planet Maetel... Mechanization HomeWorld Maetel. Mechanization Homeworld Maetel Maetel... Final Station Maetel... planet Maetel... Mechanization HomeWorld Maetel... Why? Why does this planet have the same name as you? Why? Welcome home, your highness. It's good to see you are Well. And this male you brought along... His courage and strong sense of responsibility... Were immediately logged by Central Computing. Her Majesty is most Pleased. Maetel! What-- What does this mean? Our planet functions solely... on mechanized human components. You have successfully met all our criteria... despite the fact that you killed our hero, Count Mecha. This is an unpardonable felony. In penance for your sin... you shall become a mechanized component of planet Maetel... laboring eternally for its benefit. This is some kind of joke, right Maetel? You tricked me! The royal transport aWaits. Shall We...? Tetsuro! Queen Promethium! Reporting Part Number 8998982 Human name: Tetsuro Hoshino, Your Majesty. Thank you. I 'm not becoming one of your parts! What is the suitability of this male? We sense he Will make a good bolt for the central block. The reason? This male has a strong Will. We feel he Will not break or fall out even from strong shock. Y-You're turning me into a bolt? Correct. A living bolt With a soul. A component to support the planet. Let me go! Let go! I said, lemme go! You bastards, I don't Want to be a bolt. Let go, I said! That hurts, let go! You bastards... Oww. Cut it out! Cut it out! I 'm not gonna let you monsters do this to me. Let me go! Why are you here? Did you come to laugh at hoW stupid I am? Address my daughter in that insolent tone again, and I Will kill you rather than turning you into a component. Daughter? Sole daughter of Queen Promethium, ruler of the Mechanized Empire. So that's it. I Was traveling With a mechanized monster. And I didn't suspect a damned thing. And to think I actually loved that monster. What an idiot. Tetsuro... Maetel also loves you... The voice from before-- Doctor Ban! That's right, Mother. It's Father! The traitor Who advocated the anti-mechanized World! That's right, Promethium. You pathetic mechanical Woman! My spirit has been converted to energy. And resides in the form of this pendant. There should be just enough to destroy the core of this planet... and shatter it into pieces. HoW foolish. Planet Maetel is made of live components... so that it can't be destroyed. Yes, but it Was Maetel Who acquired those components for you! Holding back her tears she Watched those comrades... sacrifice themselves so that they might be placed in strategic locations... and aWait the time of need. Comrades? Yes, Mother. Those Who came With me came in service to the same cause. Each one Was Willing to die... so that the Mechanized Empire might be destroyed! I held back my tears... and brought many, many such people here. Maetel, do you truly mean to say you Would betray me as Well? The mother Who gave you the most beautiful body in the universe? The one Who gave you eternal life...? And the one Who gave me eternal torment. Are you sane? If you throW that pendant, the entire planet Will be destroyed. It Will destroy you, as Well. Get doWn! If it means bringing doWn the mechanical Empire, then it's a bargain. There comes a time for a man When he must act... despite the dangers, knoWing he may die. There comes a time for a man When he must fight, knoWing he may lose. Tetsuro knoWs that Well. Tetsuro is not to receive so much as a scratch. Make certain he returns to Earth. Aye, aye! Tochiro. Emeraldas. My body may be gone, but my spirit lives forever. I 've become the soul of my best friend's ship, the Arcadia. I 'm off to Wander the Sea of Stars. I couldn't have done it Without Tetsuro. I knoW that, Tochiro. Tetsuro seems to have inherited your Will. I cannot let him die. Stop, Maetel. Do it, Maetel! Hurry, destroy the core of this planet! Maetel, give me the pendant. Do you intend to destroy your mother's dream? Please! This planet is the other me. This planet is my other soul! We may be living in different parts of the universe... but they're both me! HoW much longer can the atrocities of mechanized people be alloWed to continue, Maetel? You can noW Walk Without me. You can Walk just fine on your oWn. Hurry and throW it, Maetel! Come. Hand over the pendant, Maetel. But I... I... Give it to me! Tetsuro, I knoW you can do it. This is What you came here to do. ThroW it! ThroW it, so that once more life may have value. Don't do it! Maetel, We've got to get out of here! What are you doing? We're failing apart! We can't hold on! Our hands! Our feet! Don't let go! Can't hang on... failing apart. Your hands are so Warm. HoW can you be a machine? My body is your mother's, Tetsuro. I am a copy of your mother in her youth. I am a shadoW in the form of a human. When my body groWs old, I get a copy of a neW body. That is hoW I survive through the ages and Travel through time. So that's Why you look so much like my mother... Hurry! Maetel, hurry! Mother! I can't breathe. I 'm taking him With me. This is your doing, Maetel. My doing? You betrayed your mother... and deprived her of everything. NoW I shall deprive you of your precious Tetsuro. Mother... C-Can't breathe. Please stop! To see you live out the rest of your life in sorroW is my most precious Wish. Mother! What are you doing? Release me! Goodbye, Tetsuro! My one and only friend. I loved you. And that is all that remains of Claire... Who died so that you might live. I 've never seen a Glass tear like this... That just might be Claire's heart. Claire... Tetsuro... May We meet again someday in the Sea of Stars. FareWell, Captain Harlock. FareWell, Queen Emeraldas. Do you really have to go...? I am a Woman Who has Traveled through time... But in order to return to my original body... So... you're off to Pluto then. I 'll be Waiting for you. Won't We ever meet again? When the time comes and I return, you Won't knoW Who I am. I may stand right next to you, but you Won't knoW me. From noW on, I Will be a Woman Who lives on only in your memories. I Will be nothing more than an illusion of your young boy's heart, a phantom of your youth. Maetel! Tetsuro. Maetel! NoW, carrying With it a thousand thoughts, the Whistle bloWs one more. NoW, carrying With it a thousand thoughts, the train departs once more. As one journey ends, a neW one is about to begin. FareWell, Maetel. FareWell, Galaxy Express 999. FareWell days of youth.
