Mother! Damn! Mother... Mother... It took 48 minutes 37 seconds. I could have been dead by now, you idiot! God damn it! What is going on? What do you think? It was a test to see how fast you would get here. This whole thing was a test? Listen. You always need to work hard to protect our family. Be ready at all times, okay? Mother, you have no faith in me. It's not that. Your big brother did it too. Really? How long did it take him? Less than 30 minutes. And he came alone. I can't believe you brought two minions. Come on. There is no competition. I'm no match for him. You're right about that. You know what? I miss him. You're at it again. Mom! Mom! What the hell happened? Stop being ridiculous. What is this? What the hell were you doing? I have no idea. -You're pathetic. -It hurts. Stop planting trees around. -You'll wreck this, you jerk. -Gosh. You scum! Get a life! Who was it? Who kidnapped Mom? It's over. Go finish planting your tree. Shit, I'm always left in the dark. Hey, baby. Oh, baby. Can't you put it on vibration mode? Boss. It's time to go. Isn't this song beautiful? It's my favorite. I don't know music. What? I see. You must be too busy with your business. I like hardworking men like you. I go to work at 2 p.m. and get off at 6 p.m. to go to a sauna. Goodness. That is a nice schedule. I don't like a hectic life. I like taking it easy. And I drink every night. You drink? I love it too. Five shots of boilermaker get me though. Like a blinking light. Hyo-jung, right? Do you have time? I have a lot of time. What about pride? None. You are oblivious, and I'm rude. Let's not waste time. Excuse me. Shit. What could have gone wrong? I'm sorry. He is so cool. What the hell? What kind of woman do you like? Let me tell you, you are too picky with girls. You will never know. Okay? Boss! Are you okay? You bastard. Hello. Hi, Ms. Prosecutor. -Let me go. -Come on. Stay still. Bingo. A padded bra? What do you take yourself for? A utility pole? Have a seat. It's all there. You can't bribe me with that. No way. I'll have a box full of cash delivered to you. You don't get it, do you? Money won't do, especially if it's from a thug like you. You came to return the money, wearing a wire? -To bust me? -Let me tell you, I always check faces of those that I'm arresting. Don't be so uptight. Have some juice and relax. Then, we will talk afterwards. You thought I'd drink it? I know your trick. You put drugs in it. You got me there. I thought you might like getting high. -You son of a... -Gulp it down. Once you get high, my boys will gangbang you. What? A gangbang? Why are you getting mad? After the gangbang, we will sell you off to an island. Hey! I'm Jin-kyung Kim, a violent crimes prosecutor! A gangbang? I'll break your skull! You want to sell me off to an island? What the fuck do you take a prosecutor for? I'll kick your ass! What the... You drank it. You are dead meat. Shit. Strip her naked and take pictures of her. My pleasure. Bitch. It's hot! Get her! Damn. One of you stay here and see which floor she gets off. Mister, help me. Miss. Are you okay? Wake up. Miss. Mind your own business and leave her alone. I can't do that. Have you lost your mind? Shut up before I make you. -Asshole! -Hey! You bastard! You son of a bitch! What is going on here? When did you become a cop? You don't have to be a cop to do that. Anyway, who were those bastards? What? It stinks. Hey, why would you strip her? Look at this. I had no choice. Please have fun, boss. It is so strange. She looks so much like Jin-sook. My goodness. This tearoom is so nice. This is the coolest one in Seoul. It's called a café up here, not a tearoom. A café? What does it mean? "To hit"? No. It's a place to drink coffee. Goodness. You are so smart. Are you ready to order? Shit. It's all written in English. Coffee will do for me. Make it cold. You want an iced coffee? No, a cold coffee. Yes, an iced coffee. No, a cold coffee with ice in it! -Make it ice-cold. -Go now! Is everyone in Seoul that rude? Why can't she just get us what we order? They must be out of cold coffee. What is this? So, you do have a cold coffee. She must have borrowed some from next door. Wait. We didn't order this. They give you an extra here in Seoul. Really? -So, it's like a plus one deal? -That's right. I see. -Too sweet! -You are sweeter. That bitch made it too sweet. Gosh, it's bitter! What is wrong with that bitch? It's so bitter. You had a close call. It's not broken, is it? Penis never gets broken, but it can be torn off. Some ignorant thugs say, "My cock is broken." But that is just plain wrong. Okay. But it's... Oh, these metal balls? I had to remove them for the procedure. There are two, four, six, eight, ten. You put in so many balls. We don't use these cheap, low-quality balls. There can be a lot of side effects, and they are very bad for your body. I see. At my clinic, we only use top-quality metal balls. Do you want them inserted? No. I think I can manage without them. Suit yourself. Until your penis heals... You need to keep this on for a few days. Should I put it on you? Once you get high, my boys will gangbang you. After the gangbang, I'll sell you off to an island. Weren't you cold? Who are you? Why are you naked? Do you know who I am? That's... Answer me now! You don't remember? Last night in the parking lot... The parking lot? What did you do to me? Nothing. You were unconscious, and I didn't know where you live. So you brought me here? It's not what you think. You touched me, didn't you? You're dead! I never touched you. You did me with that ugly thing? Nothing happened. Trust me. Stay back, or else I'll kill you. Where are my clothes? Bring them to me! Gosh! Damn! You plant trees in and out of the house. You should be given an award. Arbor Day isn't the only day to plant trees. You should keep planting. I'm a bare mountain. What a drama queen. Okay, fine. I'll turn you into a jungle. Good morning, sir. WHITE TIGER ENTERTAINMENT Let's see. Did you have a good time? It's not that. Don't be shy with me. Nothing happened. No way. How is that possible? Do you remember my ex-girlfriend, Jin-sook? -The one with the crazy perm? -Yes. I remember her. Doesn't she look like her? She really looks like her, boss. So, you banged her all night until your cock got swollen? I said, nothing happened. Pull your pants up. Okay. Also, -come here. -Okay. Your fucking fly is open. -Let me zip it. -You can't go in there! -How are you? -Who are you? We're social workers from Share Love. So, what are you here for? You can help people in need and share love. So you're saying you want to help the poor by extorting money from us? That's not it. If you make a donation... That is extortion. You bastard. Let me show you who we are. Jong-myun. Once we help them, they will come back for more. Life is not easy. They need to be independent. You bastard. You don't watch the news? That famous doctor has succeeded in copying humans, and the Babel Prize... You son of a bitch. -Hey. -Yes, boss? You're not making sense. I'm sorry. He got me mad. Come here. Okay. A million won? Here is my business card. Call me anytime. I can drop by and tell you all about our work. -Your family name is Jang. -Yes. Where does your family come from? Iksan. Really? Mine came from Iksan too. Is that right? What is your family branch called? -White Tiger. -White Tiger? Do you want to join us? Are you good with knives? Well... Thank you. Bye. Nice meeting you. Jangs are all handsome. -Jin-kyung. -Hey. What happened last night? Are you okay? You had me worried sick. I'm fine now, right? Are you just going to let them go? No way. You should go arrest them right now. I heard that they're smuggling drugs because they're out of money. I'm waiting for a bigger bust. -I'm so sorry. -No problem. This is the security camera footage from that hotel. -Is it from the parking lot? -Yes. -Clench your teeth, asshole. -Please, boss. You feel that? -Come on, keep your head up. -Stop, boss. -Keep it up. -Stop hitting me. Not too high, asshole. -You feel that? -Stop hitting me, boss. You are pathetic. Why are you messing around with a boxing man dummy? What did it do to you? I have to train constantly to protect our family. Prevention is better than the cure. How about trying harder in bed if you value your family? What are you saying? Producing children can also help the family. What? Stop nagging me, bitch, before I make you shut up... It hurts. Let go of my arm. Right now! I will help you remember one important thing. I ruled in high school. Don't forget that. Don't make me mad. Mother is looking for you. You better hurry. This is embarrassing. -You called them in Seoul? -Yes. And what did they say? They tried to flirt with him, but he turned them all down. What? Go to Seoul and find him a wife by my birthday next month. Understood? -Yes, ma'am -Yes, ma'am. By my birthday. Don't forget. Hello? Is this Young-mi? It's me, Suk-jae. I bought you a cell phone. Remember? One with a thick accent. I'm coming to Seoul today. Why don't we... Is there anything you want? What dung? Louis Vuitton? You want me to buy you dung? You're hurting me. Oh, it's a brand name? No problem. I'll call you when I'm in town. Take it easy, bitch. Who on earth would name their brand Dung? You never buy me anything. You? Just give me a cup of coffee. You buy her Louis Vuitton. Why not me? You're a hooker, she is not. Be grateful that I hire you once a week. Suk-jae, keep it up, and I'll tell your wife. You are so hot-tempered. Okay, fine. I'll buy you dung too. -Really? -Of course. You hold onto boobs all day. What are you? A calf? We're leaving now. Can I finish what I have started? There are boobs in Seoul, too. Why are you in such a hurry? That asshole is too strict. We will finish this later. Okay. Who is it? Right after I fell asleep. Hi. Hi. Can I come in? Sure, but... Bravo! Sorry about this morning. I didn't know you had saved me. Well, It's nothing. Thanks for saving my life. No, don't mention it. Well, I don't even know your name. You want to know my name? Yes. My name is... My name is... Bro. Sorry? Were you dreaming about me, In-jae? -What is going on? -Were you dreaming? -Suk-jae. -Yes, it's me. What are you doing here? Mom sent us. Why? We were told to find you a wife by her birthday. Otherwise, she is going to marry you off to a random woman. She is talking about marriage again. What can we do? We have to bring back you and your future wife. Don't worry. -I'll handle it. -Gosh. Since you are here, why don't we go drinking? I would love to go, but I have to go buy dung and plant a tree. I'll take a rain check. We should let him rest. Let's go. -Go back to bed. -Sleep tight. It's not locked. It's open. I don't have any laundry to... Hi. What brings you here? I'm here to return your clothes. Okay. Sorry about this morning. I wasn't myself, and I forgot to thank you. Okay then. -Can I have your business card? -Sure. WHITE TIGER ENTERTAINMENT ONE SHOT DISTRIBUTION You're a social worker? That is nice. Can I have yours? I don't have one. But I'll call you tomorrow. Can you at least tell me your name? Jin-kyung. I'm Jin-kyung Kim. Is this Jong-myun? Do you have that social worker guy's business card? Yes, that one. Buy out his number by morning, okay? Are you eating, boss? What do I look like I'm doing? Sorry. How did it go? It has been taken care of. Good. What is happening out there? Should I knock your teeth out? Keep your head up. -Don't I look familiar? -You scum. -Are you out of your mind? -Why are you hitting me? How could you extort money from a gangster? I didn't. What were you thinking, asshole? We were just trying to help those in need. -What is happening to this society? -You bastard. Asshole. Come in. What is going on? You told Jong-myun to make him suffer, didn't you? I know things are tough these days. But extorting money from a gangster? Look. I just wanted his number, not his entire organization, you idiot. -I'm sorry. -You are an idiot. What the fuck goes on in your stupid head? Suk-jae, what can I do with this head? You can use it to balance yourself, asshole. That's right. Nobody can beat this deal. Hold on a second. SHARE LOVE Share Love. Ms. Jin-kyung Kim? Okay. I'll fucking put you... I'll put you through. It's Ms. Jin-kyung Kim, sir. Jin-kyung? Hi. What? Dinner? Did you take care of it? Yes, we gave them money for the hospital. And we will meet later to discuss our partnership. -Good. -Sure. -What about business cards? -Right here. Why social work suddenly? It's not our field of work. If we're going to do it, let's change the name first. Share Love is so corny. Isn't it? Yes. It doesn't really sound right. -Right. -Right. Do you have any ideas? It's the global age. Why don't we create one in English? It would look fancy. Do you have anything good in mind? Of course. We're doing social work, so it means we're like MCs, right? I guess. And it's a business, so what about "MC Business"? You must have studied English hard. Are you taking English classes? Isn't that name too difficult? That's right. We are not very good at English. Let's just have a Korean name. That is your problem. I study English a lot these days. Gosh. You know what an orange is in English? An orange? Well... I knew what it was. An orange... Don't tell me. It's coming. An orange... Jong-myun, what is it? Do you know? Do you know? You know I don't. Don't tease me. Stop yelling at me, son of a bitch. He was so noisy that I forgot. What is it in English? You ignorant bastards. Del Monte. That's right. I knew it was Del something. I had one this morning. There must be an eraser in my head. Get it out as soon as possible. Damn, I was so close. -Suk-jae. -Yes? What is Sunkist in English? Why didn't you tell me you had saved me? You are fine now. That is what counts. I'm curious about that organization you run. Share Love, right? What does it do exactly? Well... We encourage people to help people in need and collect donations. And... That's really great. How about you? What do you do? Me? I'm... a civil servant. Oh, you are a public official. How did you get yourself into that mess back then? I was returning something, and... If you run into any problems, feel free to call me. I have a new business card. "In-jae Jang"? The name is different. It was Dae-seo Jang before. Dae-seo is... my pseudonym. Oh, wow. I didn't know people still use such a thing. Let me do it. Where were you? We have been waiting for you. Why? What are you looking at? I'm trying to hook you up. They are all very elite. Pick one. No, thanks. Pick one for yourself. What is the point? I'm married. I'm seeing someone. So that's unnecessary. You have a girlfriend? We had dinner together. Oh, my. You have finally found a tree to water. Is she pretty? She is pretty. And a civil servant. Really? That's great. Mother wants a smart girl for your wife. Because your wife is an ignorant slut. Son of a bitch. You don't have to remind me. Someone is here. Get the door. You're so old-fashioned. It's a text. Who? That's... Let that text in. Where is he going? Damn, my brothers are idiots. Jang What is that? It's breast cream we confiscated from smugglers. Breast cream? What is that? You don't know? You rub it on your breasts to make them bigger. For real? You want one? What? You're kidding me. How about two? How about you, Hyo-sook? No, I don't need it. MEIRENTU What's up? I was reviewing case files. Are you sure? That look on your face says you are hiding something. I have nothing to hide from you. No, my hunch is never wrong. -What is it? -What are you doing? Let go. You're caught red-handed. I'm second to none in finding evidence. "In-jae Jang, Share Love". You ditched me yesterday to see him? Stop it. It's not funny. You're evading my question. Because that's a leading one. Fine. Are you free tonight? No. I already have plans. What? Are you meeting that guy again? It doesn't sound like it's work-related. You're getting on my nerves. Get out of here. Okay, you do have the right not to answer it. That's it for now. You're suspicious. Yes? Right, Jin-kyung. Okay. See you then, Jin-kyung. Look at you. -Unbelievable. -You're head over heels in love. It's definitely love. Right. Don't tell me you have already watered her. Who knows? It might bloom soon. How far have you gone? Have you planted a tree yet? We haven't held hands yet. What? Not even holding hands? You should be ashamed of yourself. Get it over with as soon as possible. Damn. Let me tell you. Dating is all about rhythm. I don't know. I've planted quite a few in my mind. Boss, let me suggest... I have an idea, boss. Theater is the best. You can make a move to kiss her there. Watch a horror film, and it will work out for you. Gosh! Shit. No more bright ideas... from you. Okay, boss. It was the worst day of my life. Why did you trust me? MEIRENTU What is wrong with it? Shit! It has gone bad! Gosh! Damn it. Hi, In-jae. Okay. Now? I was on my way out. I'll be right there. Your bodies will have to touch... on the motorbike. If she doesn't hold tight, she will fall off. Jin-kyung, hold on tight! Wait a minute! Wait! Please... Suk-jae, thank you! It must have worked for you. I'm a dating expert. Consult me anytime. Let me make it up to you. Take her to a theme park and enjoy rides. -Jong-myun. -Doesn't that sound fun? -Save it. -Okay. Jong-myun? AQUUS NIGHTCLUB In-jae, you must be too busy to answer the phone. I had so much fun today. But... there is something that I haven't told you. Something that I can't hide from you anymore. I told you I was a civil servant. I'm a prosecutor in charge of violent crimes. I send gangsters to jail. I guess you didn't expect that. Jong-myun. Yes, boss. -A cigarette, please. -What? Boss, I'm so sorry! In-jae, don't let him tag along from now on. He's completely useless. My brother started smoking again because of you, bastard. Get me an axe now! You bastard. How dare you attack us! Who do you think we are? I was going to pay you a visit sooner or later. You saved me time. Hold him! Put it down. It won't do us any good. They have been giving us so much trouble. You can't show weakness right now. We need to teach them a lesson. He didn't have a choice. He was only ordered to do it. I just can't believe this! God damn it! It's your lucky day, asshole. Go buy a lottery ticket, you bastard. What is your name? It's Kwang-ki. Kwang-ki? No family name? It's Cho. I knew you had one. Kwang-ki Cho. Tell your boss that if he leaves us alone, we will leave you alone, too. What did you say? If we leave them alone, they'll leave us alone, too? Is that right? Yes. Son of a bitch. Did I send you to be his messenger? No, boss. Don't talk back! Asshole. You became his dog, didn't you? Mess up again, and you will lose more than a hand, understood? The Axe Gang is on the move. As Yoon failed to take over a nightclub called Aquus last night, his expansion plan might be put on hold. Aquus? It's run by this syndicate called White Tiger based in Yeosu. They are expanding to Seoul. White Tiger? Mr. Choi, can you prepare an organizational chart? Yes, ma'am. Why didn't those bastards stay in Yeosu? What do they want in Seoul? Be it Axe or White Tiger, we have to bust them all. Remember that time is crucial. We need to start moving. Collect all information you can find about them. Okay then, let's wrap it up. You haven't had breakfast yet. How about steamed cod? I don't eat breakfast. You go ahead. How about dinner then? I know this great lacquer-boiled chicken place. They have a history of 30 years. I'm allergic to lacquer. What about fried chicken then? I know a great place in Jong-no. I'm having chicken for lunch. Weren't you surprised? No. I know people have prejudice against female prosecutors. I mean... Why? They think we are too aggressive. It's true that I'm quite tough. But you have to be tough in your job. I'm not hiding any more secrets. What about you, In-jae? Bong? Marques de Riscal is perfect for a romantic guy like me. Do you like it? It's good. What did you want to tell me? Oh, that's... Don't keep me waiting. Your dessert is ready, sir. Jin-kyung, will you marry me? What? I have had a crush on you for three years now. I thought about this carefully. You do deserve me. Well, hold on. Where is the bathroom? Please follow me. What? It's not like we have been going out. Hi, In-jae. Now? I'm having dinner with a colleague. Are you drunk? What? You're coming over here? I can't stop missing you But you seem too far An old faded picture... Excuse me. Where is the guy who was here? -He must have left in shock. -What? He proposed to you, and you turned him down. I can't stop missing you Where have you gone? The fond memories of you Bring tears to my eyes Please come back to me I can't believe this. Please come back Come back to me The thought of you fills my head Love as hot as a blazing fire Do not run from it Please, my love Come back to me I can't stop missing you Where have you gone? The fond memories of you Bring tears to my eyes Please come back to me Did you drink a lot? Me? No. Just a little bit. Come back to me I have something to tell you. Sure. Let's go. Love as hot as a blazing fire Please, my love Come back to me What is wrong? I've never seen you drunk before. The thing is, it's my birthday today, so I drank a little. Really? Why didn't you tell me? I'm used to drinking alone. Wait here. Happy birthday. Well... There is something about me you are not aware of. -In fact... -I'll get to know you better -with time. -That will be too late. The part of your life before we met, it's not important to me. As long as you're the man who I think he is, I couldn't care less. That makes me feel better. I've had some dark days. Of course. Those dark days got you where you are today. It's not like you were a gangster. The current you is good enough for me. To your birthday. PROSECUTION You're still here? Yes. What is that? Profiles on White Tiger. Let me see. It's okay. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. There you are. I'm sorry about last night, but I... Here. WHITE TIGER GANG -They already got this? -Check it out. IN-JAE JANG What is this? It's a joke, isn't it? Why would I joke about it? That profile shows the truth. In-jae Jang is a gangster. A cheesy, hook-nosed thug. No, he can't be a gangster. You can't trust this picture. This guy just resembles him and has the same name. It can't be him. I know him too well. Gosh. What are you? An idiot? He has been lying to you from the start. He saved my life. You remember when I got held by the Axe Gang? He saved me that night. Whatever. Stop seeing him. He approached you for a reason. It smells fishy. Have a good trip. Bye. -Good trip, boss. -See you later. Don't play around, or else you're dead. -Jin-kyung. -In-jae. I couldn't reach you on the phone. Is there anything wrong? No. I was just busy with this tricky case that I'm on. You should have called me. I was worried. I'm sorry. Have you had dinner? Are you sick? You don't look so well. I'm just tired. Do you want to go eat something? No. I just want to go to bed. Really? Okay then. Do you have anything to say? Well... I'm going down to Yeosu for my mother's birthday. I see. Send her my regards. Good night. You scrub yourself too hard. That tattoo might come off. I want to look good for Mom's birthday. -Suk-jae. -What? Do you like it? What? The sauna? Our business. Being a gangster. That is a stupid question. Who likes being a gangster? It's a family business. And it's the only world that I know. What? You don't like it? I don't like it. I want to quit. You can't act like that. You are our leader. Why are you saying this all of a sudden? Is this about the girl you're seeing? Does she dislike that you're a gangster? Do you remember what Father said? Women are obstacles for gangsters. They should be like furniture that is always there. We shouldn't let them get in the way. It's hard to meet a nice girl. But you're the leader of our family. Think carefully. PROSECUTOR JIN-KYUNG KIM Ms. Kim. White Tiger is relatively clean. They have been low-profile in Seoul. Thanks. And this is what you requested. SHARE LOVE'S DONATION RECORDS DONATION RECORDS Come here, asshole. Is this a graduation party? Just go. What is this? Thanks. Write your name. Thanks. Go eat inside. Thanks.

All those big stars. "Gummy, Turtles, Country Kko Kko"? Gosh. Did we open a zoo here? What are all these? They are all singers. Really? Why do they use animals' names? I wonder. "S.papa?" Whose papa is he? -Are you done? -No. I'm Duk-man Kim. Let me see. What is that? Is this a baby's birthday? What is this? You bastard. Do you think our mother is turning one-year-old? Take it back. Wait. What is his name? I'm sorry. I'll go get a bigger one. Jong-myun, follow him. Make sure that he comes back. Okay. How many have come so far? Stop there. You're dead if I... How...

You are so pretty. You didn't have to come if you were busy. It's quite far from Seoul. Hi. I'm Suk-jae Jang, his younger brother. -Hi. -Oh, my. What is wrong? Why are you speaking like that? What are you doing? Take her inside. Okay. Let's go. Who is that bitch? Why is Mother so happy to see her? Watch your mouth. They might get married. It's so weird. She looks so much like Jin-sook. Jin-sook? You're right. He has a consistent taste in women. He only likes those who look like a broken anchovy's head. HOON-A NA The moment of parting is here Do not cry even if you're sad It's already too late Do not regret anything Tears are unnecessary Loneliness is harder You're so hot. Whenever you are lonely Cry when you miss me Happy birthday, Ms. Hong. I'm so happy to sing for you. There she is. Ms. Hong. -Happy birthday. -Ms. Hong. -You look great. -Thanks for coming. Look. She is my future eldest daughter-in-law. She's beautiful. Of course. This is Mr. Cho. He owns most of the bars in Suncheon. Cut it out. You're embarrassing me. This is Mr. Park from Gwangju. Hi. Every pimp in the region knows him. He goes to jail so often that I see more of him on TV. Stop making trouble for yourself. And this is Mr. Yoshimura from Japan. I was too busy to call. I'm really sorry about that. What does she do for a living? What does she do? She's a civil servant. You know how hard it is to get a government job. -Of course. -She works at... I work at Prosecutor's Office. -What? -She must know many prosecutors. Prosecutor's Office? It's such a scary place for a woman to work at. What do you do there? I'm a prosecutor. Goodness. You mean... Yes, I arrest gangsters and put them in jail. Asshole. -Ms. Hong. -What? Something has come up. -I should go... -No problem. Go now. I have to go too. My mother is very sick. She's on her deathbed? Go now. -I also... -Yes, you should go. Everybody, get out of here. Out of here! Now! They all suddenly got busy. Get the fuck out. Goodness. Tell me, Ms. Prosecutor... Please don't address me as a prosecutor. No, I can't address you otherwise. You are a prosecutor after all. Is that okay, ma'am? Of course, Mother. Did you register those guns? Of course, I did. I'm a law-abiding citizen. That's good. Otherwise, you should register them right away. They are all toy guns. Go try them. I'll give you live bullets. They won't fire. That knife is very sharp. We make sashimi at home. Yeosu is famous for fish. I hear some people use it on people. Really? Who? That is so scary. I'm an ordinary housewife. I've only seen stuff like that in movies. We're in trouble! We're busy now. Come back later. The Popeye Family attacked our men. -What? Those bastards? -Oh, my. We haven't seen Popeye for ages. Why is he here? To see Olive, I bet. Tell him to have fun. We have to take them on and kick their fucking asses. You don't need to swear. Go back to work. Why are they fighting? Tell them to play nicely. Play pat-a-cake. It's so strange. What's so strange? I know this girl who looks exactly like you. Really? Who is she? She and In-jae had a serious relationship. They almost got married. They did? What am I saying? You don't need to hear this. I'll keep it a secret. Please tell me. Well... It was over ten years ago when I first met Jin-sook. Both she and I were infamous. When we first met, we recognized each other. We were both strong. She could have finished me off. But instead, she took me in. Everybody knew she and In-jae were going out. When they were together, no one could ever lay a finger on them. But as fate had it... Happy birthday. A rose of Sharon has bloomed. So cute. Green light, red light. Green light, red light. Green light, red light. If that hadn't happened... Why are these freaking tears coming out? I'm sorry. It reminded me of the old days. Goodbye, Mother. We'll be going. Have a safe trip back. -Call me later, In-jae. -I will. -Take care. -Bye. Are you okay with her? She is a prosecutor. Why not? It's a family honor. She could put our family in trouble. She doesn't know anything about us? If she finds out, she would dump him in a heartbeat. She saw those fuckers. She must have gotten the hint. -I guess so. -Let's get inside. -Let's go. -Let's go. You think I'm stupid? Did you really think you could deceive me forever? A social worker? You extort money from people and help those in need? I'm sorry. You sold the night club. Is it a power game between syndicates? I'm not a genius. But I know what to do in order not to lose you. A prosecutor can't love a gangster, right? So, I've decided to change. How do I know that feeling is not temporary? I... I love you, Jin-kyung. If I ever do what gangsters do again, you can put cuffs on me yourself. SHARE LOVE Fuck. Hi. Oh, my god. What are you doing? Gosh! What is going on here? You can't do this. Kyung-jae. What is that? What the hell is that? How dare you? Our father worked his ass off for what we have now. You have no right to throw it all away. You sold the night club and donated every penny! Since when did you become so nice? What about us? We might starve to death because of your damn social work. You're a gangster. Act like one. I'm no longer a gangster. What? You're not a gangster anymore? You have lived in Seoul for too long. We are from a gangster family. How can you be not a gangster? Are you going to dump us over that prosecutor bitch? This isn't a tiger anymore. I'll have it erased. We are done. REPRESENTATIVE'S OFFICE What is this? -What's going on? -What? Am I not your brother? Aren't we family? So what? I'm always left in the dark. What happened between you and In-jae? Damn. I would never dump my family over a woman. If he touches what we have left now, I will hit him. It must be hard on him too. We have to understand him. What the fuck? If you want to take his side, go to him. Go! I'll be a lonely gangster in the wilderness. Look, asshole. I'm neutral on this matter. We're in trouble. Bastards from the Axe Gang took your brothers! Are you In-jae Jang? What are you doing here? We agreed to end the war. I didn't. It was just your idea. I never agreed. Boss! Oh, no. In-jae! In-jae! In-jae! What happened? Look who is talking! They let us go. We have come to save you. Those bastards set us up. I'm going to kill you all. Let us do it. You have the right to remain silent and consult an attorney. You can refuse to answer questions that can be used against you. Jin-kyung. You're quitting? How come? You didn't do anything wrong. Do you want one? I quit. You did? Live a long life. It's not smoking that kills you, but knives, isn't it? A boss fighting with kids? Goodness. That is some social work. Look at me. Tell me. Who's the real boss? It's your mom, isn't it? The real boss? I lead the family alone. My mom is just an old lady. And my brothers... They run their own business with the money I gave them. Taking the blame alone? How touching. Is that brotherhood? No, it's the truth. Let my innocent brothers go. You can put me in jail. Don't tell me what to do. It's been a while, Jin-kyung. -Hi. -Are you okay? Yes. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? It's my sons' fault, not yours. Don't mind it. What brings you here? I got a letter the other day. I want you to read it. You must be tired. Go ahead. I'm leaving. Mother, do you like Jin-kyung? I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She is an angel. If I will marry her, I don't think I can continue doing this. As a prosecutor's husband, I shouldn't keep this up. I got rid of some businesses without your consent, With that money, I started some social work. I'm sorry that I took away what you accomplished. Why don't we start anew by doing good things? Please understand me, Mother. -Mother. -Yes? I got you some water. Put a pain-relief patch on my back for me. My whole body aches. -It's killing me. -Okay. It hurts so much. Right here. Is it boring to be retired? Is there anything you want to do? Tell me if you want to go somewhere. I've wanted to go to a sauna and take a bath. Because of this tattoo, I haven't been to a sauna in 40 years. Mother. I shouldn't have let my children follow in my steps. I was too greedy. I was. DEFENSE COUNSEL PROSECUTION COUNSEL All rise. Why isn't the lawyer here yet? -Keep your mouth shut. -It's starting now. God damn. You may be seated. DEFENSE COUNSEL Where is the defense counselor? Sorry, I'm late, Your Honor. Case number 2005-1325. Charges are establishing a criminal organization and assault. The court opens now. On June 23, you and your subordinates assaulted Do-sik Yoon and 28 other men, did you not? Yes. On May 19, at a nightclub that you owned, you assaulted Kwang-ki Cho and others, did you not? Yes. You gave the orders yourself, did you not? No. I gave the orders. No. I'm the one who did it. Your Honor, I gave the orders. Be quiet. Or I will have you removed from the court. Do you know an organization called Share Love? Yes. What does it do? It does social work. What is your relation to it? I'm the representative. Share Love is a non-profit organization established back in 1996. He became the representative last April. Since then, he has been raising donations to charity groups and welfare facilities. It's the record of donations made by Share Love and other enterprises run by the accused. Objection, Your Honor! The accused took over Share Love for a private purpose. A private purpose? Can you tell us what it is? He wanted to hide his true identity to gain the favor of the defense counselor. For three months since April, she and the accused had a romantic relationship. I want it to be known that she is mixing work with personal feelings. Am I right, Counselor Kim? I have something to tell you regarding the case. Who are you? Someone In-jae saved from being handicapped. What are you doing? I didn't do anything wrong! Gosh! My back hurts. You have been convicted twice for burglary, haven't you? God damn it. That was so long ago. I quit after I got married. You can help me win the case. I know you can do it. Yes. My boys had some trouble with the White Tiger in May, so I wanted to meet In-jae. But he attacked us... -and beat my men up. -Jin-kyung, here. It was chaos. You must have been very upset. I can't even sleep well these days. That is the truth. -I rest my case. -Go! Defense counselor? It's taken. God, you bitch. We will talk about this later. WITNESS I'm admitting new evidence. Is it working? Is it filming? Yes, boss. What is this for? I can't trust that Prosecutor Bong. If we tape it, he won't be able to betray us. This is our insurance. Understood? So you want me to set a trap for him and his brothers, right? I was going to launch an attack anyway. Can I trust you, Mr. Prosecutor? Sure. Don't worry. Just do as I say. And keep your mouth shut. Okay, I trust you. Sure. I was set up, Your Honor. This is... Who is that? Your Honor. I was a prosecutor for five years, and I couldn't be more ashamed. He tainted the reputation of prosecutors while they try hard to bring justice. I feel dishonored because of his immorality as a prosecutor. The accused has been set up just because he was once a gangster. He is the true victim in this case. Also, I request an immediate investigation on Prosecutor Bong. She has the same accent. He needs to be punished. Asshole. Yes! Stop! Gosh, it hurts. DISBANDING OF WHITE TIGER GANG LET'S START AFRESH! I'm so nervous -about meeting her father. -Don't be nervous. Although she was a prosecutor, we are from a good family. Who am I? I'm Duk-ja Hong from Yeosu. That's right. Women wear the pants in our family. What's wrong with you? Shut up. Aren't you Duk-ja? Duk-ja Hong! Sweetheart. -Mother. -Sweetheart. This is for our... Shut up. I finally got reunited with my first love after 40 years. Don't butt in. What? When you were 20, you were so petite and cute. Oh, come on. Stop it! I need to get married, Mother. Shut up. You're still young. Dad, don't you want me to get married? You are not even 30 yet. What's the hurry? I think we should reconsider this wedding. Sweetheart, can we talk in private? -Sure. -Let's go. -Dad! -Dad! -Father! -Mother! Subtitle translation by Min-jin Kim
