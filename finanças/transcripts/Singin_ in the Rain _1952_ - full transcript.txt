Singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' We're happy again We'll walk down the lane With a happy refrain And singin' Just singin' in the rain This is Dora Bailey... talking to you from the front of the Chinese Theater in Hollywood. What a night, ladies and gentlemen! Every star in Hollywood's heaven is here... to make Monumental Pictures' premiere of 'The Royal Rascal'... the outstanding event of 1927. Everyone is breathlessly awaiting... the arrival of Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood. Look who's arriving now! It's that famous Zip Girl of the screen... the darling of the flapper set, Zelda Zanders. Zelda! Oh, Zelda! With her new red-hot pash, J. Cumberland Spendrill III... that well-known eligible bachelor. Zelda's had so much unhappiness. I hope this time it's really love. And here comes that exotic star, Olga Mara... and her new husband, the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon. They've been married two months already... but still as happy as newlyweds. Well, well, well. It's Cosmo Brown! Cosmo is Don Lockwood's best friend. He plays the piano for Don and Lina to get them into those romantic moods. Oh, folks, this is it! The stars of tonight's picture, those romantic lovers of the screen... Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont! Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at this gorgeous couple... it's no wonder they're a household name all over the world... like bacon and eggs. Lockwood and Lamont. Don, you can tell me confidentially... are these rumors true that wedding bells are soon to ring for you and Lina? Lina and I have no statement to make right now. We're just good friends. You've come a long way together, Don. Won't you tell us how it all happened? Well, Lina and I have made a number of pictures together... No, no, Don. I want your story from the beginning. Dora, not in front of all these people. Yes! But, Don, the story of your success is an inspiration... to young people all over the world. - Please. - Yes! Well, to begin with, any story of my career... would have to include my lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown! We were kids together, grew up together, worked together. Yes? Well, Dora, I've had one motto which I've always lived by: Dignity. Always dignity. This was instilled in me by Mom and Dad from the very beginning. They sent me to the finest schools, including dancing school. That's where I first met Cosmo. And with him, I used to perform for all of Mom and Dad's society friends. They used to make such a fuss over me. If I was good, I was allowed to accompany Mom and Dad to the theater. They brought me up on Shaw, Moliere... the finest of the classics. To this was added musical training at the Conservatory of Fine Arts. We rounded out our apprenticeship... at the most exclusive dramatics academy. And at all times... the motto remained: Dignity. Always dignity. In a few years, Cosmo and I embarked on a dance concert tour. We played the finest symphonic halls in the country. Fit as a fiddle and ready for love I can jump over the moon up above Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Haven't a worry, haven't a care Feel like a feather that's floatin' on air Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Soon the church bells will be ringin' And a march with Ma and Pa All the church bells will be ringin' With a hey-nonny-nonny and a hot-cha-cha Hi-diddle-diddle, my baby's okay Ask me a riddle, I'm happy to say Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Audiences everywhere adored us. Finally, we decided to come to sunny California. We were stranded... We were staying here when the offers from movie studios started pouring in. We sorted them out and decided to favor Monumental Pictures. Okay, Lina, you hate him. Keep that mood music going. Phil, you come in. Keep on grinding. Now you see her. Now here's the bit, Bert, where you get it on the jaw. Cut! No, no! That wasn't right, Bert! You were supposed to go over the bar and crash into the glasses! Try it again, okay, Bert? Bert! Oh, that's just swell! Take him away, fellas. You'll be all right, Bert. We've lost more darn stuntmen on this picture! It'll take hours to get a new one over from central casting! Mr. Dexter, I can do that. - You're a musician! - That's a moot point. No kidding! What's your name? Don Lockwood, sir, but the fellas call me Donald. Wise guy, huh? Okay, I'll try you. Get this guy into Bert's suit! And remember, Lockwood, you might be trading that fiddle in for a harp! Camera! Phil, come in! Now you see him! Here's where you get it right on the jaw! Cut! That was wonderful! You got any more little chores you want done? Plenty. My roles in these films were urbane... sophisticated, suave. And of course, all through those pictures... Lina was, as always, an inspiration to me. Warm and helpful. A real lady. Hello, Miss Lamont. I'm Don Lockwood, the stuntman. It was sure a thrill working with you, Miss Lamont. Don, I want you to meet the producer of the picture, Mr. R.F. Simpson. I just saw some rushes for the picture and asked Dexter who the stuntmen were. He told me they were all you. I'm putting you and Lina together in a picture. Come to my office. - We'll discuss a contract. - Thanks, Mr. Simpson! Are you doing anything tonight, Miss Lamont? Well, that's funny. I'm busy. Lina and I have had the same wonderful relationship ever since. But most important of all, I continue living up to my motto: Dignity. Always dignity. Thank you, Don. And I'm sure you and Lina will continue making movie history tonight... in your greatest picture, 'The Royal Rascal.' Get enough, boys? She's so refined. I think I'll kill myself. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We're pretty darn thrilled at your response to 'The Royal Rascal.' We had fun making it, and we hope you had fun seeing it tonight. We screen actors aren't much good at speaking in public... so we'll just act out our thanks. It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson? It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson? - Don. Lina, you were gorgeous. - You look pretty good for a girl. For heaven's sake, what's the big idea? Can't a girl get a word in edgewise? After all, they're my public too! The publicity department, Rod here, thought it would be much better... if Don made the speeches for the team. Why? You're a beautiful woman. Audiences think you've got a voice to match. The studio's gotta keep their stars from looking ridiculous at any cost. - No one's got that much money. - What's wrong with the way I talk? What's the big idea? Am I dumb or something? No. It's just that Don's had so much more experience... Next time, write me out a speech. I could memorize it. Why don't you go out now and recite the Gettysburg Address? What do you know about it, you piano player? Are you anybody? Donnie, how can you let him talk to me like that, your fianc?e? My fian... Now, Lina, you've been reading those fan magazines again. You shouldn't believe all that banana oil... that Dora Bailey and the columnists dish out. Now try to get this straight. There is nothing between us. There has never been anything between us. Just air. Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that. Come on. We'll be late for R.F.'s party. You better go in separate cars to break up the mobs, huh? Ta-ta, Donnie! See ya there! Donnie. What's wrong with that girl? Can't she take a gentle hint? Haven't you heard? She's irresistible. She told me so herself. I can't shake her. This cooked-up romance, just for publicity. The price of fame. You've got the glory. You've gotta take the little heartaches that go with it. Look at me. I got no glory. I got no fame. I got no mansions. I got no money. But I've got... What have I got? - I don't know. What? - I gotta get outta here. Don't tell me. It's a flat tire. I don't understand. This car hasn't given me trouble for six hours. There's Don Lockwood! - Give me your autograph! - Hi, kids! I want a souvenir! - I want a souvenir too! - Hold on there! You're tearing my... Hey, Cos, call me a cab! Okay, you're a cab. Thanks a lot! - Lady, keep driving. - Get out of here! - I'll call the police! - Don't do that. - Don't hurt me! - I'm not a criminal. You are a criminal! I've seen that face before. - You're a famous gangster! - Let me explain... I've seen your picture in the post office. Officer! This man jumped into my car... - Why, it's Don Lockwood! - Don Lockwood? - Out for a joyride? - Just a lift, Officer. My car broke down, I got surrounded... You're a lucky lady. Anything wrong? - Why, no. - I should think not. Good night. Good night, Officer. Well, thanks for saving my life. I'll get out now. I'm driving to Beverly Hills. Can I drop you someplace? I'd like to get out of this torn suit if you're going by Camden and Sunset. Yes, I am. I'd very much like to know whose hospitality I'm enjoying. Selden. Kathy Selden. Enchanted, Miss Selden. I'm sorry I frightened you. I was getting a little too much love from my adoring fans. Oh, that's what you were running away from. They did that to you? That's terrible. Yes, it is, isn't it? It is terrible. Well, we movie stars get the glory. I guess we have to take the little heartaches that go with it. People think we lead lives of glamour and romance... but we're really lonely. Terribly lonely. Mr. Lockwood, I can't tell you how sorry I am about taking you for a criminal... but it was understandable under the circumstances. - I knew I'd seen you. - Which of my pictures have you seen? I don't remember. I saw one once. - You saw one once? - You were dueling. There was a girl, Lina Lamont. Though I don't go to the movies much. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. - Thank you. - No offense. Movies are entertaining enough for the masses... but the personalities on the screen just don't impress me. They don't talk, they don't act. They just make a lot of dumb show. Well, you know. Like that. You mean, like what I do? Well, yes. Well, yes. Here we are, Sunset and Camden. Wait a minute. You mean, I'm not an actor? - Pantomime on the screen isn't acting? - Of course not. Acting means great parts, wonderful lines, speaking those glorious words. - Words. - Shakespeare, Ibsen. What's your lofty mission in life that lets you sneer at my humble profession? Well, I'm an actress. On the stage. Oh, on the stage. I'd like to see you act. What are you in now? I could brush up on my English or bring along an interpreter... if they'd let in a movie actor. I'm not in a play now, but I will be. I'm going to New York... You're going to New York. Someday we'll all hear of you, won't we? Kathy Selden as Juliet, as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear. You'll have to wear a beard for that one. Laugh if you want to, but at least the stage is a dignified profession. What are you so conceited about? You're nothing but a shadow on film. You're not flesh and blood. - Stop! - Why? I'm only a shadow. Just because you're a big movie star... you expect every girl to fall in a dead faint at your feet! Well, don't you touch me! Fear not, sweet lady. I will not molest you. I am but a humble jester... and you are too far above me. Farewell, Ethel Barrymore. I must tear myself from your side. - Is this R.F. Simpson's house? - Yes, miss. - I'm from the Coconut Grove. - Around the back, please. I see. Thank you. - Nice party, R.F. - Thanks, Roscoe. Mr. Brown, do you really think you could get me in the movies? - I should think so. - Really? There's Don! I loved the picture tonight. - Don, did you come by way of Australia? - Hello, Cos. Listen, Cos, tell me the truth. Am I a good actor? As long as I'm working for Monumental, you're the greatest. You're my pal. You can tell me. What's the matter? Of course you're good. Maybe you should tell me from time to time. - I feel a little shaken. - The new Don Lockwood. Where have you been? We've been waiting for you. There you are, Donnie. I was lonely. - Hello, Lina. - Okay, fellas, hold it. Together again, like two little stars. Don and Lina. No kidding, folks. Aren't they great? All right, open that screen. - A movie? We've just seen one. - Hollywood law says we have to. I've got a few little surprises for you tonight. All right, everyone, sit down. This will give you a lot of laughs. There's a madman coming into my office now for months, and... - Got that gadget working, Sam? - All set, Mr. Simpson. - Got that gadget working, Sam? - All set, Mr. Simpson. Okay, let her go. Hello. This is a demonstration of a talking picture. Notice, it is a picture of me, and I am talking. Note how my lips and the sound issuing from them... are synchronized together... in perfect unison. - Who's that? - Somebody's talking behind that screen. - Come out from there, Mr. Simpson. - No, I'm right here. My voice has been recorded on a record. A talking picture. Thank you. Good-bye. - Well? - It's just a toy. - It's a scream! - It's vulgar. - Think they'll ever use it? - I doubt it. The Warner Brothers are making a whole talking picture, 'The Jazz Singer.' They'll lose their shirts. What do you think, Dexter? - It'll never amount to a thing. - They said that about automobiles. Let's get on with the show, boys. Come on, my little starlets. I have a delicious surprise. A very special cake. I want you kiddies to have the first piece. Well, if it isn't Ethel Barrymore. I do hope you're gonna favor us with something special. - Please. - Say Hamlet's soliloquy. - Or a scene from 'Romeo and Juliet.' - Mr. Lockwood... Don't be shy. You'd make about the prettiest Juliet I've ever seen, really. All I do is dream of you the whole night through With the dawn I still go on dreaming of you You're every thought You're everything You're every song I ever sing Summer, winter, autumn and spring And were there more than 24 hours a day They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away When skies are gray When skies are blue Morning, noon and nighttime too All I do the whole day through is dream of you You're the cat's meow! All I do the whole day through is dream of you - I have to tell you how good you were. - Excuse me. Now that I know where you live, I'd like to see you home. - Listen, Mr. Lockwood... - Say! Who is this dame? Oh, someone lofty and far above us all. She couldn't learn anything from the movies. She's an actress on the legitimate stage. Here's one thing I've learned from the movies! Lina, she was aiming at me! - You've never looked lovelier. - It was just an accident. It happens to me five or six times a day. Where is she? Donnie? Excuse me. Where'd Miss Selden go? She just grabbed her things and vaulted. Anything I can do? Sorry. I don't have time to find out. Keep that action going. Let's have more steam in the kettle. A little more action, boys. More steam and water in that kettle. - Good morning, fellas. - Did you read 'Variety' today? 'First talking picture, The Jazz Singer, all-time smash by end of first week.' - All-time flop by end of the second. - We start today. - Good luck. - Thanks. I am now Count Pierre de Battaille, better known as the Dueling Cavalier. - What's this one about? - It's a French Revolution story. You're a French aristocrat, and she's a simple girl of the people... and she won't even give you a tumble. Well, it's a living. Hit him. Hit him. Knock him down. Get up there and hit him again. Why bother to shoot this picture? Release the old one under a new title. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. - What'd you say that for? - What's the matter? That's what that Kathy Selden said to me that night. That's three weeks ago. Are you still thinking about that? - Well, I can't get her out of my mind. - How could you? She's the first dame who hasn't fallen for your line since you were four. - I guess she's on my conscience. - It's not your fault she lost her job. - I've got to find her. - You've been trying to... short of sending out bloodhounds and a posse. Snap out of it. Don't let a little thing get you down. You're Don Lockwood, aren't you? Donald Lockwood's an actor, isn't he? What's the first thing an actor learns? The show must go on! Come rain, come shine, come snow, come sleet, the show must go on! Ridi, Pagliacci, ridi. The world's so full of a number of things. I'm sure we should all be as happy as... But are we? No. Definitely no. Positively no! Decidedly no! Short people have long faces, and long people have short faces. Big people have little humor, and little people have no humor at all. And in the words of that immortal bard, Samuel J. Snodgrass... as he was about to be led to the guillotine... as he was about to be led to the guillotine... Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh Don't you know everyone wants to laugh My dad said Be an actor, my son But be a comical one They'll be standin' in lines For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines Now you could study Shakespeare and be quite elite And you could charm the critics and have nothing to eat Just slip on a banana peel The world's at your feet Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh Don't you know everyone wants to laugh My grandpa said Go out and tell 'em a joke But give it plenty of hoke Make 'em roar make 'em scream Take a fall, butt a wall split a seam You start off by pretending you're a dancer with grace You wiggle 'til they're giggling all over the place And then you get a great big custard pie in the face Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh Don't you... All the... My dad... They'll be standin' in lines For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh Don't you know everyone... Make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh Make 'em laugh - Ready, Don? - All set, Roscoe. Here we go again. I think we have another smash on our hands. - I hope so. - You're darn tootin' we have. - Where's Lina? - Here she is. Well, well, here comes our lovely leading lady now. This wig weighs a ton. What dope would wear a thing like this? - Everybody used to wear them. - Then everybody was a dope. Honey, you look beautiful. Yes, you look great. Let's get into the set. Thanks, Joe. I looked for you the other night at Wally Ray's party. - Where were you? - I've been busy. And I know what you've been busy at... lookin' for that girl. - As a matter of fact, yes. - Why? - I've been worried about her. - You should've been worried about me. After all, I'm the one who got the whipped cream in the kisser. But you didn't lose your job, and she did. You're darn tootin' she did. I arranged it. What? They weren't gonna fire her, so I called them and told them they'd better. Okay, Don, remember. You're madly in love with her, and you must overcome her shyness and timidity. Cosmo, mood music. Roll 'em! Okay, Don. Now enter. You see her. Run to her! Why, you rattlesnake, you. You got that poor kid fired. That's not all I'm gonna do if I ever get my hands on her. I never heard of anything so low. Fine. Looks great. What did you do it for? 'Cause you liked her. I could tell. So that's it. Believe me, I don't like her half as much as I hate you. You reptile. Sticks and stones may break my bones... I'd like to break every bone in your body. You and who else, you big lummox? Kiss her, Don. That's it! More! Great! Cut! You couldn't kiss me like that and not mean it just a teensy bit. Meet the greatest actor in the world. I'd rather kiss a tarantula! - You don't mean that. - I don't... Joe, bring me a tarantula. Listen, Lina... Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds. Let's get another take. Hold it! - Hold it! - Hello, Mr. Simpson. - We're really rolling. - Stop rolling at once. All right, everybody, save it! Tell them to go home. We're shutting down for a few weeks. - What? - Don't just stand there, tell them! Everybody go home until further notice! What is this? - What's the matter, R.F.? - 'The Jazz Singer,' that's what. My darlin' little mammy down in Alabamy This is no joke, Cosmo. The public is screaming for more. - More what? - Talking pictures! - It's just a freak. - We should have such a freak here. I told you talking pictures were a menace, but no one would listen to me. Don, we're going to put our best feet forward. We're going to make 'The Dueling Cavalier' into a talking picture. That means I'm out of a job. I can start suffering and write that symphony. We're putting you in as head of the new music department. Thanks, R.F.! I can stop suffering and write that symphony. Wait a second, Mr. Simpson. I think you should wait... Every studio is jumping on the bandwagon. Theaters are putting in sound equipment. We don't want to be left out. - We know nothing about this gadget. - What do you have to know? You do what you always did. You just add talking to it. - Yeah? - Believe me, it will be a sensation. - Yeah? - Believe me, it will be a sensation. 'Lamont And Lockwood: They Talk.' Well, of course we talk. Don't everybody? I got a feelin' you're foolin' I got a feelin' you're havin' fun I'll get the go-by when you are done foolin' with me It's a holiday, today's the wedding of the painted doll It's a jolly day The news is spreading Should I reveal exactly how I feel Should I confess Beautiful girl You're a lovely picture Beautiful girl You're a gorgeous picture Of all that lies under the big blue skies My heart cries That girl on his right looks familiar. You're a dazzling eyeful - I've featured her in nightclub shows. - That's probably where I've seen her. She'd be good in the part of Zelda's kid sister. - That's a good idea. - Excuse me. There may be blondes and brunettes That are hard to resist You surpass them like a queen You've got those lips that were meant to be kissed And you're over sweet 16 Oh, beautiful girl What a gorgeous creature Beautiful girl Let me call a preacher What can I do But give my heart to you A beautiful girl is like a great work of art. She's stylish. She's chic. And she also is smart For lounging in her boudoir... this simple, plain pajama. Her cloak is trimmed with monkey fur... to lend a dash of drama. Anyone for tennis? Well, this will make them cringe. And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner... if your gown just drips with fringe. You simply can't be too modest... at the beach or by the pool. And in summertime it's organdy... that'll keep you fresh and cool. You'd never guess what loud applause... this cunning hat receives. And you'd never dream the things that you could hide... within these sleeves. A string of pearls with a suit of tweed. It started quite a riot. And if you must wear fox to the opera... Dame Fashion says, 'Dye it.' Black is best when you're in court. The judge will be impressed But white is right when you're a bride And you want to be well-dressed Beautiful girl For you I've got a passion Beautiful girl You're my queen of fashion I'm in a whirl Over my beautiful Girl - That's stupendous! - Thanks. - Kathy, come here. - This'll start a new trend in musicals. Kathy, Mr. Simpson is thinking of casting you as Zelda's kid sister. That's wonderful, Mr. Simpson. - That's Kathy Selden! - Thanks anyway. - Wait a minute. - That's all right. Before Mr. Lockwood reminds you, you might as well know... I'm the girl who hit Miss Lamont with a cake. Believe me, it was meant for Mr. Lockwood! Good-bye, Sid. I should have told you. Wait a minute. What's this about, R.F.? We wanted to use her in Zelda's picture, but if it made you and Lina unhappy... I think it's wonderful. - He's been looking for her for weeks. - Are you speaking for Lina also? R.F., the owner of the Coconut Grove may do what Lina tells him to... - but you're the head of this studio. - Yes, I am. She's hired. But don't let Lina know she's on the lot. - Take care of that, Phillips. - Thank you! I'm glad you turned up. We've looked inside every cake in town. Is it all right for you to be seen with me? You mean, lofty star with humble player? Not exactly, but for lunch, don't you usually tear a pheasant with Lamont? Look, Kathy, all that stuff about Lina and me is sheer publicity. Oh? It certainly seems more than that. From what I've read in the columns and the fan magazines... You read the fan magazines. I pick them up in the beauty parlor or the dentist's office... just like anybody. Honest? - Well, I buy four or five a month. - You buy four or five? Anyway, to get back to the main point... you and Miss Lamont do achieve an intimacy in all your pictures... Did you say all my pictures? I guess now that I think of it, I've seen eight or nine of them. Eight or nine. It seems to me I remember someone saying... 'If you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.' I did say some awful things that night, didn't I? No. I deserved them. Of course, I must admit I was pretty much upset by them. So upset that I haven't been able to think of anything but you ever since. Honest? Honest. Well, I've been pretty upset too. Kathy, look. Seeing you again, now that I... Kathy, I'm trying to say something to you, but I... I'm such a ham. I guess I'm not able to without the proper setting. - What do you mean? - Well... Come here. This is the proper setting. Why, it's just an empty stage. At first glance, yes. But wait a second. A beautiful sunset. Mist from the distant mountains. Colored lights in a garden. Milady is standing on her balcony... in a rose-trellised bower... flooded with moonlight. We add 500,000 kilowatts of stardust... a soft summer breeze... and... You sure look lovely in the moonlight, Kathy. Now that you have the proper setting, can you say it? I'll try. Life was a song You came along I've laid awake the whole night through If I but dared To think you cared This is what I'd say to you You were meant for me And I was meant for you Nature patterned you And when she was done You were all the sweet things Rolled up in one You're like a plaintive melody That never lets me free But I'm content The angels must have sent you And they meant you Just for me But I'm content The angels must have sent you And they meant you Just for me Now... ta, te, ti, to, tu. Ta, tay, tee, toe, too. No, no, Miss Lamont. Round tones, round tones. Now let me hear you read your line. And I can't stand 'im. And I can't stand him. And I can't stand 'im. Can't. Can't. 'Cahn't.' 'Can-t.' Can't. Can't. Very good. Now... Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran. - Around the rocks the rugged... - No, rocks, rocks. Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran. - Shall I continue? - Go ahead. Don't mind me. Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter... seized his knees and sneezed. - Sinful Caesar snipped his sifter... - No, sipped his snifter. - Sipped his snifter. - Oh, thank you. Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed. - Marvelous. - Wonderful. Oh, here is a good one. Chester chooses chestnuts, cheddar cheese with chewy chives. He chews them and he chooses them. He chooses them and he chews them, those chestnuts... cheddar cheese and chives in cheery, charming chunks. - Wonderful! Do another one. - Thank you. Moses supposes his toeses are roses... but Moses supposes erroneously. Moses, he knowses his toeses aren't roses... as Moses supposes his toeses to be. Moses supposes his toeses are roses... but Moses supposes erroneously. But Moses, he knowses his toeses aren't roses... as Moses supposes his toeses to be. Moses supposes his toeses are roses... but Moses supposes erroneously. - A Mose is a Mose. - A rose is a rose. A toes is a toes. Moses supposes his toeses are roses But Moses supposes erroneously For Moses, he knowses his toeses aren't roses As Moses supposes his toeses to be - Moses - He supposes his toeses are roses - Moses - But Moses supposes erroneously - Eenie meenie minie Moses - He knowses his toeses aren't roses As Moses supposes his toeses to be A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is A rose is what Moses supposes his toes is Couldn't be a lily or a taffy-daffy-dilly It's gotta be a rose 'cause it rhymes with Mose All right, here we go. - Quiet! - Quiet! Roll 'em! Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't... She's gotta talk into the mike. I can't pick it up. Cut! - What's the matter, Dexter? - It's Lina. Look, Lina, don't you remember? I told you. There's a microphone right there in the bush. - Yeah. - You have to talk into it. I was talking, wasn't I, Miss Dinsmore? Yes, my dear, but please remember: round tones. Pierre, you shouldn't have come. Pierre, you shouldn't have come. - Yes, that's much better. - Hold it a second! Now, Lina, look. Here's the mike, right here in the bush. - Yeah. - Now you talk towards it. The sound goes through the cable to the box. A man records it on a big record in wax. But you have to talk into the mike first... in the bush! Now try it again. - Gee, this is dumb. - She'll get it, Dexter. Lina, don't worry. We're all a little nervous the first day. Everything's gonna be okay. Roscoe, you know the scene where I say, 'Imperious Princess of the night'? I don't like those lines there. Is it okay if I say what I always do? 'I love you, I love you, I love you'? Sure. Any way it's comfortable. But into the bush! Okay, again! Quiet! - Quiet! - Roll 'em! ...you shouldn't have... ...flirting with danger. ...surely find you out. Cut! Lina, we're missing every other word. You've got to talk into the mike! Well, I can't make love to a bush! All right, all right. We'll have to think of something else. What are you doing? - You're being wired for sound. - What? Watch out for those dentalized D's and T's and those flat A's. Everybody's picking on me! Okay, Lina, now look at this flower. See? The mike is in there. That's it. Now the sound will run from it... through this wire onto the record. It'll catch whatever you say. Now, let's hear how it sounds, Lina. Okay, quiet! - Quiet! - Roll 'em! Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have come. You're flirting with danger. They will surely... - What's that noise? - The mike's picking up her heartbeat. Swell. Cut! That's right. That should do it. Now don't forget, Lina, the mike is on your shoulder... and whatever you say goes through the wire onto the record. - Now please, Lina, talk into the mike. - Yeah. Don't make any quick, jerky movements or you might disconnect it. Okay, let's go. Quiet. Quiet! Roll 'em! Pierre, you shouldn't have come. You're flirting with danger. What's this wire doing here? It's dangerous. You two shouldn't go into the theater together. Lina's probably waiting right inside the door. - How I wish... - Don't worry. I'll be leading the cheering section in the balcony. Good luck. What's that, the thunderstorm outside? It's those pearls, Mr. Simpson. I am the noblest lady of the court, second only to the queen... yet I am the saddest of the mortals in France. What is the matter, my lady? I'm so downhearted, Theresa. My father has me betrothed to the Baron de Landsfield... and I can't stand 'im. But he is such a catch. All the ladies of the court wish they were in your pretty shoes. My heart belongs to another. Pierre de Battaille. Ever since I met him, I can't get 'im outta my mind. Sounds good and loud, huh? Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have... You're flirting with danger. They will surely... ...too valuable. She never could remember where the microphone was, boss. 'Tis Cupid himself that called me here, and I... smitten by his arrow... The night is full of our enemies. Hey, Lina, whatcha hittin' him with, a blackjack? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Did somebody get paid for writing that dialogue? Sounds like a comedy inside. - It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie. - What? This is terrible. What's that? The sound. It's out of synchronization! - Tell them to fix it! - Yes, sir. What's this? Yvonne, captured by Rouge Noir of the Purple Terror? Oh! Oh, my sword! I must fly to her side. Yvonne, Yvonne, my own! Pierre will save me! Pierre! Pierre is miles away, you wench! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No... no... no! This is a scream. This is a scream. Give me pictures like 'The Jazz Singer.' I love you! I love you! We're all ruined. - You can't release this picture. - We've got to. We're booked to open in six weeks all over the country. But you're such big stars, we might get by. I never want to see Lockwood and Lamont again. - Wasn't that awful? - This is the worst picture ever made. I liked it. Take a last look at it. It'll be up for auction in the morning. You're out of your mind. Besides, it's Saturday. No bank's gonna foreclose until Monday. - It wasn't so bad. - That's what I've been telling him. There's no use kidding myself. Once they release 'The Dueling Cavalier'... Lockwood and Lamont are through. The picture's a museum piece. I'm a museum piece. Things went wrong with the sound. If you straighten out the technical end... It wasn't that. This is sweet of both of you, but I... Something happened to me tonight. I... Everything you ever said about me is true. I'm no actor. I never was. Just a lot of dumb show. I know that now. Well, at least you're taking it lying down. No kidding. Did you ever see anything as idiotic as me on that screen tonight? Yeah. How about Lina? All right. I ran her a close second. Maybe it was a photo finish. Anyway, I'm through. - You're not through! - Of course not. With your looks and figure, you could drive an ice wagon or shine shoes. - Block hats. - Sell pencils. - Dig ditches. - Or go back into vaudeville. Fit as a fiddle and ready for love I could jump over the moon up above Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Too bad I didn't do that in 'Dueling Cavalier.' They might have liked it. - Why don't you? - What? - Make a musical. - Musical? Sure. Make a musical. The new Don Lockwood. He yodels. He jumps about to music. The only trouble is that after they release 'Dueling Cavalier'... nobody would come to see me jump off the Woolworth Building into a damp rag. Why don't you turn 'The Dueling Cavalier' into a musical? - 'Dueling Cavalier'? - Sure. They've got six weeks before it's released. Add songs and dances, trim the bad scenes, add new ones. And you got it. Hey, I think it'll work. Of course! It may be crazy, but we're gonna do it. 'The Dueling Cavalier' is now a musical. - Hot dog! - Hallelujah! Fellas, I feel this is my lucky day. March 23rd. - No, your lucky day's the 24th. - What do you mean? It's 1:30. It's morning. Yes, and what a lovely mornin'. Yes, and what a lovely mornin'. - Good mornin' - Good mornin' We've talked the whole night through - Good mornin' - Good mornin' to you Good mornin', good mornin' It's great to stay up late Good mornin' Good mornin' to you When the band began to play the stars were shining bright Now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say good night So good mornin', good mornin' Sunbeams will soon smile through Good mornin' Good mornin' to you And you and you and you Good mornin', good mornin' We've gabbed the whole night through Good mornin' Good mornin' to you Nothin' could be grander than to be in Louisiana In the morning In the morning It's great to stay up late Good mornin' Good mornin' to you Might be just as zippy if we was in Mississippi When we left the movie show The future wasn't bright But came the dawn, the show goes on and I don't wanna say good night So say good mornin' Good mornin' Rainbows are shining through Good mornin' - Good mornin' - Bonjour Monsieur - Buenos d?as - Muchas fr?as Buon giorno Guten Morgen Good mornin' to you - ?Ol?! - ?Toro! ?Toro! ?Ah-ha! Charleston! Hey, we can't make this a musical. What do you mean? She can't act, she can't sing and she can't dance. - A triple threat. - Yeah. What's so funny? I'm sorry. I was just thinking. I liked her best when the sound went off and she said... 'Yes, yes, yes!' No, no, no! Wait a minute. I am just about to be brilliant. Come here, Kathy. Now sing. I said, 'Sing.' - Good mornin' - Good mornin' - Keep your eyes on my face. - We talked the whole night through Good mornin' Good mornin' to you Watch my mouth. Good mornin', good mornin' It's great to stay up late Good mornin', good mornin' to you Well? Convincing? Enchanting. What? Don't you get it? Use Kathy's voice. Lina moves her mouth, and Kathy's voice comes over singing and talking for her. - That's wonderful. - I couldn't let you do it. - Why not? - Because you wouldn't be seen. - You'd be throwing away your own career. - It has nothing to do with my career. It's only for this one picture. The important thing now is to save 'The Dueling Cavalier'... save Lockwood and Lamont. All right, if it's only for this one picture, but... - Do you think it'll get by? - Of course it will. Sure, and it's simple to work the numbers. Just dance around Lina and teach her how to take a bow. All right, we'll spring it on R.F. in the morning. Don, you're a genius. I'm glad you thought of it. Good night, Kathy. See you tomorrow. Good night, Don. Take care of that throat. You're a big singing star now, remember? This California dew is just a little heavier than usual tonight. Really? From where I stand, the sun is shining all over the place. I'm singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again I'm laughin' at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart And I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face I walk down the lane With a happy refrain Just singin' Singin' in the rain Dancin' in the rain I'm happy again I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain I'm dancin' And singin' In the rain That's wonderful! Now look. We'll keep it secret until we're ready to release, in case it doesn't come off. But I'm worried about Lina. She doesn't like Miss Selden. - There might be fireworks. - Lina won't even know she's on the lot. Okay. Boys, this is great. 'The Dueling Cavalier' can be saved. Now, let's see. 'The Dueling Cavalier' with music. The title's not right. We need a musical title. Cosmo? 'The Dueling Mammy.' I've got it. - 'The Dancing Cavalier.' - That's it. 'The Dancing Cavalier.' Cosmo, remind me to make you a scriptwriter. - Thanks, R.F. Have a cigar. - Thanks. Now what about the story? We need modern musical numbers. How's this? We throw a modern section into the picture. The hero's a young hoofer in a Broadway show. He sings and dances. One night backstage, he's reading 'A Tale of Two Cities'... and a sandbag falls and hits him on the head... and he dreams he's back during the French Revolution. This way we get in the modern dancing numbers... Charleston. But in the dream part, we can still use the costume stuff. Sensational! Cosmo, remind me to give you a raise. Gimme a raise. He holds her in his arms Would you Would you He tells her of her charms Would you Would you They met as you and I And they were only friends But before The story ends He'll kiss her with a sigh Would you Would you And if the girl were I Would you Would you And would you dare to say Let's do the same as they I would Would you And would you dare to say Let's do the same as they I would Would you Perfect. That Selden girl is great. Once the picture is released, I'll give her a big buildup. - Swell! - How much is there left to do? - One scene and a number. - What number? It's new. It's for the modern part of the picture. It's called 'Broadway Melody.' It's the story of a young hoofer who comes to New York. First, we set the stage with a song. It goes like this. It goes like this. Don't bring a frown to Old Broadway Ah, you gotta clown on Broadway Your troubles there They're out of style For Broadway always wears a smile A million lights They flicker there A million hearts beat quicker there No skies of gray on that Great White Way That's the Broadway Melo-dy Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Shh! Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance Out on that gay White Way In each merry cafe Orchestras play Takin' your breath away Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody sing and dance That Broadway rhythm That Broadway rhythm When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street That Broadway rhythm Writhing, beating Rhythm Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancing down the street Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance That's the Broadway Melo-dy That's the idea of the number. What do you think of it? That's the idea of the number. What do you think of it? I can't quite visualize it. I'll have to see it on film first. - On film it'll be better yet. - Get goin', fellas. You've got to have that Selden girl rerecord all of Lina's dialogue. - It's all set up. - And remember: Don't let Lina know about it. All set in there? All set in there? Nothing can keep us apart. Our love will last 'til the stars turn cold. All right, Kathy. Go ahead. Nothing can keep us apart. Our love will last 'til the stars turn cold. That's great. Perfect. Cut. 'Til the stars turn cold. Oh, Kathy, I love you. I can't wait 'til this picture's finished. No more secrecy. I'm gonna let Lina and everyone know. Your fans will be bitterly disappointed. From now on, there's only one fan I'm worrying about. There! What did I tell you, Lina? Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal. I want that girl off the lot at once. She ain't gonna be my voice. Zelda told me everything. - Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal. - Any time, Don. - Look, Miss Lamont. Don and I... - Don? Don't you dare call him Don! I was calling him Don before you were born! I mean... I mean... You were kissing him! I was kissing her! I happen to be in love with her. That's ridiculous. Everybody knows you're in love with me. Look, Lina. Try and understand this. I'm going to marry her. Silly boy. She ain't the marrying kind. She's just a flirt trying to get ahead by using you. I'll put a stop to that. I'm gonna go see R.F. right now! You're a little late. The picture's already finished. If she weren't in the picture, you would be finished too. As far as I can see, she's the only one who's finished. - Who will ever hear of her? - Everybody. Why do you think Zelda's in such a sweat? Because Kathy nearly stole the picture from her. She's doing you a favor, helping you in 'The Dancing Cavalier.' And she's getting full screen credit for it too. You mean it's gonna say up on the screen that I don't talk and sing for myself? Of course. What do you think? - They can't do that. - It's already done. And there's a whole publicity campaign being planned. Publicity? They can't make a fool outta Lina Lamont! They can't make a laughingstock outta Lina Lamont! What do they think I am, dumb or something? I make more money than... than Calvin Coolidge... put together! 'Monumental Pictures wildly enthusiastic... over Lina's singing pipes and dancing stems.' I never said that. 'Premiere tomorrow night to reveal Lina Lamont big musical talent.' Boss, you can't pull a switch like this on the publicity department. We were all prepared on the campaign for Kathy Selden. Now you do this. At least keep us informed. I don't know anything about this. I had nothing to do with it. - What are we gonna do? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You wouldn't want to call the papers and say that Lina Lamont is a big fat liar. Lina, did you send this stuff out? I gave an exclusive story to every paper in town. You'll never get away with it. Rod, call the papers back. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Don't tell me what to do! What do you think I am, dumb or something? I had my lawyer go over my contract. And I control my publicity, not you. - Yeah? - Yeah. The studio's responsible for every word printed about me. If I don't like it, I can sue. What? I can sue. If you tell the papers about Kathy Selden... it would be 'detrimental and deleterious' to my career. I could sue you for the whole studio. - That's a lot of nonsense. - Says so right here. Contract dated June 8, 1925... paragraph 34, subdivision letter 'A': 'The party of the first part'... That's me. You win, Lina. Take Kathy Selden's credit off the screen. Go ahead. Let's just get this premiere over with. Satisfied? Just one little thing more. You want me to change the name of the studio... to Lamont Pictures Incorporated? Oh, R.F., you're cute. I was just thinking... you've given this little girl a part in Zelda's picture... and you're gonna give her an even bigger one in the next? - So what? - So, if she's done such a grand job... doubling for my voice, don't you think she oughta go on doing just that... and nothing else? You're crazy. I'm still more important to the studio than she is. I wouldn't do that to her in a million years. You'd be taking her career away from her. People don't do things like that. People? I ain't people. I'm a... 'A shimmering, glowing star... in the cinema firmament.' It says so. Right there. Oh, Pierre. Pierre, my darling. At last I've found you. Oh, Pierre. Pierre, you're hurt. Oh, Pierre. Pierre, you're hurt. Oh, speak to me. I'll kiss her with a sigh Would you, would you And if the girl were I Would you, would you Oh, Pierre, hold me in your arms always. Lockwood's a sensation. Yes, but Lamont. What a voice! Isn't she marvelous! - It's going over wonderfully, isn't it? - Yeah. Our love will last 'til the stars turn cold. And would you dare to say Let's do the same as they I would Would you - R.F., it's a real smash. - Congratulations, kids. - We owe you a lot. - Thanks, Mr. Simpson. - Kathy, we made it! - Don, it's a miracle! It's just great, Don. Lina, you were fabulous. You sang as well as Kathy. Yeah, and I'm gonna for a long time. - What do you mean by that? - She's gonna go right on singing for me. Listen, Lina. I thought something was cooking beneath those bleached curls of yours. Now get this! Kathy has a career of her own. She only did this for the one picture. That's what you think. Come on! Lina's getting carried away, isn't she, boss? - Yes, she is. - Listen, you boa constrictor. Don't get any fancy ideas about the future. Tell her. Never mind! Listen to that applause, and wait 'til the money starts rolling in. You won't give all that up because some nobody don't wanna be my voice. She's got something there. It's a gold mine. Part of that choice is mine, and I just won't do it. You got a five-year contract. You'll do what R.F. says. Why don't you tell her off? I'm confused. This thing is so big... - They're tearing the house apart. - Take a curtain call. I once gave you a cigar. Can I have it back? - Wait a minute... - Listen to 'em! I'm an avalanche! Selden, you're stuck! If this happens, you'll get yourself a new boy. I won't stand for it! Who needs you? They'd come to see me if I played opposite a monkey! Just a minute. Don's a smash too. I'm still running the studio! I'm not so sure! You're the big Mr. Producer, always running things, running me. From now on, as far as I'm concerned, I'm running things. Lina Lamont Pictures Incorporated, huh? - Yeah. - You've gone too far. - Don, they're yelling for a speech. - A speech. Yeah, everybody's always making speeches for me. Tonight I'm gonna do my own talking. I'm gonna make the speech! - You can't do that! - Wait a minute, Rod. This is Lina's big night, and she's entitled to do the talking. - Right? - Right. Ladies and gentlemen... I can't tell you how thrilled we are at your reception... for 'The Dancing Cavalier,' our first musical picture together. If we bring a little joy into your humdrum lives... it makes us feel as though our hard work ain't been in vain for nothin'. Bless you all! She didn't sound that way in the picture. Cut the talk, Lina. Sing! I got an idea. What am I gonna do? We've got it. Rod, set up a microphone back of that curtain. Kathy, come here. Kathy will stand back there and sing for you. She'll be back of the curtain singing, and I'll be out in front doing... like in the picture? - That's right. - What? You gotta do it. This thing is too big. Of course she's got to do it. She's got a contract. - Get over to that microphone. - You heard him. Do it! I'll do it, Don... but I never want to see you again, on or off the screen. Come on, Lina. What are you going to sing, Miss Lamont? 'Singing In The Rain.' 'Singing In The Rain.' 'Singing In The Rain.' In what key? 'A' flat. 'A' flat. In 'A' flat. I'm singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again I'm laughin' at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face I'll walk down the lane With a happy refrain I'm singin' Just singin' in the rain I'm singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again I'm laughin' at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase... Ladies and gentlemen, stop that girl running up the aisle! That's the girl whose voice you heard and loved tonight! She's the real star of the picture. Kathy Selden! You are My lucky star I saw you From afar Two lovely eyes At me they were gleaming Beaming I was starstruck You're all My lucky charms I'm lucky In your arms You've opened heaven's portal Here on Earth for this poor mortal You are My lucky Star
