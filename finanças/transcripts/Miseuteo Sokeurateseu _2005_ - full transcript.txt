He got carried away after becoming a cop. Attorney CHO Dae-su Teacher. We need your skills once again. Pick a better student this time. For our business, we need one that's... ...merciless and inhumane. A depraved trash. That's what we need. One that was born a dog. When will you grow up? I'm in the can, and you ask me for money? Not asking for it. Borrowing it. I don't have any. I hear they pay you for your labor here. I don't work in here. I have no money for you. How do I trust you? I'm your son. If I weren't your dad, I would've killed you long ago. What do you need it for? To get Dong-pil a tutor so he can study and go to college. You expect me to buy it? I'm your son. Shut the fuck up. Don't let him... ...turn out like you - Please. - What's wrong with me? You're a scumbag. Fuck! Dad, I'm your son. Young man? Young man? Yeah? What? What'd you hit him with? How's his head? Is it bleeding? See if he's breathing. I'm on my way. Stupid asshole. Grandpa. What? I was just saying... You can't smoke in here. God damn! I didn't mean to hit him in the head. It was an accident. He got too close while I was swinging. - So you did hit him. - He got too close! Help me bury him. Look. What would I do that for? Come on, save my ass. You got money? What money? I'm broke. You should pay the price. You killed your friend for God's sake. - I'll forget what you owe me. - Are you kidding me? Show me some brotherhood. Brotherhood? Brotherhood... You owe him money, don't you? If I get caught, you're going down with me. My life is screwed anyway. We'll rot together. Can't take a joke? Ajoke? We're best buddies, aren't we? Kneel down and sir me. Sir. Sir! Look. Why the hell murder? Why? Fine, I'll help you. Really? Thanks, man. Let me go pee first, and we'll bury him together. Okay. Don't take too long. - I'm scared shitless. - Okay. You know I'm sensitive. Shake a leg. The police? Listen. I'm reporting a murder. No, the killer is still here. Come get him now. What? I have to give my name? It's NOH Mu-hyun. Who the fuck are you? Stop fighting, asshole. Stay the fuck still! Let's go. You look like a faggot. You're a thug, not a pile of bricks. What's up with your hair? Why the hell are we here? - Why? - Yeah. Let me tell you. Why? Does anybody else want to know why? If so, ask now. What's he like? That one? He's one of us. Nobody likes him, though. He's a bad ass. He's the lowest of the lowest among them. Wonderful. You. What education did you have? I got expelled from High. Wonderful. 'When you leave me out of disgust... ' '... I will let you go without words. ' This poem... - Who wrote it? - Beats me. Don't interrupt me, asshole! Pick your answer. A. KIM Du- hwan B. LEE Jung- jae C. Sirasoni, D. KIM So- wol D. Write your name. You kidding me? In English, asshole! You passed both oral and written tests. Congratulations. - I passed? - That's right. What does that mean? The syndicate wants to train me? Study hard from now on. He must be tired. Let him sleep some. Sleep tight. Student? Student? Get up now. It's time to get up. Leave me alone. You're not ready to learn. Hi, I'm Jae-hak. He got into Seoul National University with flying colors. Let's get started. Look ahead! - Begin the class. - Okay. Above all, you need to study these textbooks thoroughly. - Look. - Yes? Can I ask a question? What the fuck do you need to ask? - Shut up and study! - Mr. KIM! Where are we? At a school. Are you supposed to swear at school, or not? You're a teacher. Act like one. Sure. Damn! KOO Dong-hyuk, ask your question. Yes, Teacher. What's going on here? - We're in a class. - A class? What class? Korean, English, math, and other subjects. Why should I study them? Because you're a student. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a counselor in charge of your life here. Those gentlemen back there work under me. I served in the Marine Corps for 10 years. For another 10 as a trusty... ...I dedicated myself into rehabilitating other inmates. Thus, my experiences will help you a great deal. Complement, union, intersection, relative complement... Demonstrated in Venn Diagram... You shouldn't sleep in class. That's not being a student. Follow me to the office. Awake now? - Don't sleep in class again. - I won't. This is to encourage you to focus on your studies. You won't get away this easily next time. - What's the reason? - You need a reason to learn? - It's a show, isn't it? - A show? You just wanna scare me. The real thing is coming, isn't it? The real thing? What's that? How to use knives. You're making me a killer for the syndicate. A school producing a killer? - What for? - Fuck. Fuck! I was sick of studying I dropped out of high school. Fuck you. Teach me how to kill, motherfucker! What'd you just call me? 'Motherfucker'? We're at a temple of learning. - How dare you! - Fuck you! A student shouldn't swear! This is a school. A place where you study! You're a student. And I'm your teacher. Don't put me down! Teacher, that's enough. I do wanna treat you with love. With love! How many times have I told you? How could you not memorize one thing a day? Yeah, I'm fucking stupid. - Huh? - Come here. You... Watch your back outside at night. I'll drill a hole through your damn head. Sir? I can't do this. He scares me so much. Isn't it stifling to be inside all day long? We'll have the next class out in the open. It's a math question. The train is running at 120 KPH. The station is 20KM away. And the train left it at 10:50. What time will it get here? If you get the answer... ...I'll give you this key. But there's a time limit. If you go over it... ...your arms and legs will leave your body. Quick! I got it. Think before you answer it. - At 11 sharp. - Correct! Study! It's the only way out. A school? More like a POW camp! - What are you doing? - Playing hooky. You shoot to death those who play hooky? You're neglecting your duty as a student. I dropped out of school, just like you did. Back then, I was green and reckless. But looking back, I couldn't be sorrier. If a teacher had guided me on the right path... ...I wouldn't have lived a life full of regrets. Turn around and roll up your pants. Close your eyes. It will hurt. School where you can dream You can never be forcedinto studying. Those who aced the SAT, for example. They weren't forced to study. They studied voluntarily around the clock. You think they were beaten to study hard? No way. What the fuck! Fuck me! Go in there. Study this while you're in here. Begin the class. Adolescence refers to a marginal man, Sturm and Drang... ...and the 2nd birth. This is very important. Repeat after me. - A marginal man. - A marginal man. A quadratic formula? A quadratic formula? Fuck... ...you. Are you revolting? Quit playing. Why don't you kill me? Lose the attitude! If you won't kill me, expel me. Nobody gets expelled here. Dropping out is possible. Only in a plastic bag! I'll drop out. I won't study. Remember? You went through that. They're your juniors. Aren't they fresh? Especially that one. Isn't he your brother? How nice. He's determined to follow his big brother's steps. His eyes are sparkling. Give him a knife, and he will whack anyone. He's very ambitious and knows how to fight. We might put him on the field right away... ...though that might hinder your studies. Your bother down on the street with a broken skull... It'll break your focus, won't it? Right? Studying saves the nation and the syndicate. And beloved ones as well. Let me ask you again. A quadratic formula? A quadratic formula? AX... The square root of AX plus... When BX is C... Hard to memorize? Apply it to things around you. It makes it a lot easier. The 1st law of motion is the law of inertia. The 2nd law of motion is the law of acceleration. The 3rd law of motion is the law of action and reaction. - 'Men are an index of all things. ' - Protagoras. 'A law is a law, however undesirable it may be' Socrates. - 'Return to the nature. ' - Rousseau. 'Nothing could be more pleasurable than learning. ' Confucius. Teacher? What if... What if I don't pass the GED test? Study for one more year. Fuck... If so... I'm dropping out. Try to relax. I have faith in you. You reach the announcement of passers for GED 2004. Please press the examinee's number. You passed it. The AGP is 68%. Good bye, Teacher. Wait. We're not done yet. There's one more test left. Recruit of Police Offiicers Dong-hyuk? Considering what you've accomplished... ...this should be a piece of cake. I believe you can pass it. Study! It's the only way out. I can't. No way. You've been teaching me to become a cop? You don't want to? I do. I fucking love it. Why wouldn't I? The police have the license... ...to beat up people. Let me read your palm. Fortunately, you have a long life line. When you become a cop... ...don't do anything stupid to get killed on the job. What's wrong with you, Dong-pil? - Bro. - Didn't I tell you? I said I'd kill you if you messed up again. Fuck you. You were a thug, too. 'Fuck you'? Don't you dare to swear in front of me. I'm a cop now. But you were a thug. That was the period of the second birth. The period of Sturm and Drang. Study. It's the only way out. Study? Do you have any idea why I became a thug? I didn't want you to become the likes of me. I wanted to make money like a dog... ...and give you a normal life. Dong-pil. Bro! I wanted to treat you with love. With love! Okay. I will do whatever you say from now on. Good. I know you too well. For you... Words won't do. Pledge to him that you'll never mess around again. Dad, I will be good. What happened to his face? I gave him a lesson to grow up. You did? How about yourself? I've almost grown up. Is that so? Look at you. What's up with the uniform? I didn't wanna live a life that you'd led. Is that so? When you get out this time, be good. - Your son is a cop now. - No shit. Fuck you. Blow into it, sir. I'm not drunk. - Come on. - I said I'm not drunk! You don't believe me? You don't? Call the Blue House. My friend works there. He has strings to pull. So what? - You deal with him then. - Why should I? KOO stopped him. It's his shit. I'll talk to him nicely. Okay. Sir? You have to do it again. Why is this... Damn, you drank a lot. Did I want a traffic cop? There's a problem. He's been typical of him since he became a cop. He's considered a black sheep at the station. Teacher. How old are you? How would you feel if I tell you to act your age? You fucking... Make him a homicide detective. It's been exactly 10 days since BAEKbroke out of jail. The police have been flooded with countless tips about... We should get him. Why should we? He's a bad guy. A bounty has been posted... ...and the police have set up various checkpoints. He contacted his girlfriend on his way to the south. And he has a friend living in this area. Doesn't it smell? - What smell? - You're so stupid! Yes, I can hear you. That Hammer guy knows the area well. Right. Get him ASAP. BAEK is from Mokpo and the current address is Gunsan. Call the syndicates in the area for help. Let's go. Where's BAEK? I already told the police. We're not pigs. Relax and tell us. Turn it off. It's him, alright. Hit him! The police have no tips on BAEK's whereabouts. The police says... Are you done? Let me see him. Now? It's been a week. I miss him. Please, no more. You like it here? Wanna stay longer? No, no way. Do you wanna stay here or go back to jail? Please, send me back to jail. I wanna finish my time nice and easy. I'm begging you. Go then. I can? Thank you. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. No, I can't thank you enough. I'm so grateful. A lot of our boys are in the can. They'll be nice to you. Thank you. How can I repay you? I owe you big time. Once I go back, I'll try to be a trusty. I'll persuade others not to break out of jail. I'll tell them it's cruel out here. I'll kill you all! I'm a dangerous guy. I'll kill you all! I have nothing to lose. So I don't care. The police are here. Don't move! - Fucking Police, too. - Can you hear me? Of course! You're talking into a bullhorn for God's sake! Wanna fucking hear it? Release the hostages and surrender. Surrender? You can kiss my ass! Fuck you, asshole! What are your demands? The very question I wanted. Officer KOO Dong-hyuk! - What? - God damn. Give me a bullhorn so I won't have to yell! Officer KOO Dong-hyuk from Juyup branch. Get his ass here. I'll give you 10 minutes. Or I will kill everybody! I'd be happy to go to jail! Officer KOO speaking. It's been 10 minutes! - Sir! - You think you can fool me? Think again! Get me a watch! One that works well! - You're KOO Dong-hyuk? - Yes. - It's been a while. - Do I know you? Stop pretending that you don't know me. They still can see you. Come inside. - Or I'll kill her! - Fine. I hate guys like you, KOO, with a strong sense of justice! You sacrifice yourself for the public... ...and put the nation before yourself! You know how upset I got in the can? You're the one that I broke out of jail for! Work with me here. Don't move! Don't move! You have to arrest me with a style. So help me out here. We're fighting now, okay? Don't move! Wow, you sure can fight! Here I come! So fast! I'm not bleeding. Blood! As long as you live, there would be no crimes! All my life... I've lived surrounded by those trying to kill me. I've always needed a wall to keep me safe. And I finally found one. You know what it is? It's the law. The law you abide by. Isn't it ironic? Who would've guessed that the law would protect me? However, there's a hole in every wall. No matter how small it is... ...it could bring down the whole wall. I'll keep that in mind. I spent good 3 months on that report. What? Insufficient evidence? I'm not saying we should arrest him now. We don't even know his whereabouts. I'm just asking to expand the investigation. Why always lower your tail at the mention of his name? Did I say you were a dog? I didn't say that. Fucking asshole! Okay then. Fine, I will. 'Carefully and thoroughly' my ass! What are you doing? Mr. Prosecutor says we don't have enough evidence. Go pick up some scumbags! - Who are you? - I'm KOO Dong-hyuk. KOO Dong-hyuk? I can't believe they sent us a green rookie. Why Homicide? You get fucked around here. I don't care. - What? - Come here. Okay. We can't afford to waste time training a rookie. Go bring him in. - What's his name? - Don't know. - On what charge? - You'll figure it out. Get your ass out of here and get him. Fucking stupid! So nice. Hey, Longhair. Hey! Get back here! Damn... Wait! What did I do wrong? It's not you. I'm sorry. I got the wrong guy. The wrong guy? Hold your freaking horses, will you? In a minute, I'll make you keep coming. You'll be in heaven. - Oh, it's you again. - What the... Somebody tipped me... ...that this guy was here. I'm sorry. Bye. Motherfucker! Forgive me. I didn't mean to say it. Come on, I'm older. Please, don't hit me. You're bleeding. Wash it off. I will. Every nook and cranny. What's this? - They're Viagra. - Why'd you grind them? Yeah, why did I? My throat is so small that it's easier to take that way. And it works better. That's how I like it. Crazy ass. Bye. I'm sorry. Wait. Look, Detective! Huh? Why? Who the hell do I look like? You look exactly like him. This guy and I look alike? What do you have for eyes? I don't look anything like him! Take a look. Eyes. Nose. Mouth and moustache. You both have them all. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - It's your crime to look like him. It's me, asshole. Do you know what Dong-su's up to lately? You do, or don't? I've been living in hell because of him. Yes. Right. You do? Where is he? Where? Where the hell is he? Stand straight. They're cold cases. Prove that it wasn't luck this time. Open up. It's me Dong-hyuk. My friend! I know you killed him by accident. - Be glad that I got you. - Get your hand off me! What's wrong with you? - Did you eat? - God damn it! You turned in, right? Answer me. Right? Yes, you did. You're cool. What's wrong? Come on. Who are those fucks? They're members of rival gangs. Who tipped you off? This kid from another gang is my informant. It doesn't matter. We can put them all away. If we call for backup now, we'll lose most of them. Get me an ambulance if my head cracks. It's been a while, man. How are you? Those bastards! You know him? I don't know We've shed enough blood. Let's truce. Stab that asshole! Sons of bitches! Who are you? I've never seen you before. Me? - I'm not with you, asshole. - What? - He's with me. - What's this? - Call for backup now. - You were good. I've never lost to anyone. Frankly speaking... ...I did better back in school than those prosecutors. How come a bad ass like you look more cop than me? I'm not a bad ass. Why did they expel you from high school then? For I was a marginal man. The period of the 2nd birth. The period of Sturm and Drang. I didn't know back then, but I do now. Know what? - Ethics! - Ethics? I studied it for the GED. How to live a good life is all in the ethics book. What's in the ethics book? A view on life. 'Nothing could be more pleasurable than learning. ' It's that famous phrase... ...by Confucius. - That's your view on life? - It's changed a bit. Since I'm a cop, I have a new one. What is it? 'A law is a law, however undesirable it may be. ' Socrates. Let's make a deal. I'll take care of you. In turn, you help me. There's this guy above me that I detest. He's a damn prosecutor. I wanna bring him down. To do that... I gotta nail JANG Tae- chun that he shelters. You've heard of him? He's been hiding out for 10 years now. Nobody knows where he is and what he's up to. Decide while I'm gone peeing. On a second thought... I'm your boss. You do what I say. What the fuck! Fucking asshole! Look where you're going! - He looks like a pig. - A pig? I should beat him more then. You're a pig, too? Do I look like a pig to you? Hey, Socrates. I like your philosophy. Police, Me, Syndicate Hello? Yes, Teacher. Welcome, Detective KOO. He's nothing but a trash. He extorted money from street vendors... ...and gangbanged those girls working at clubs. He's an animal. Furthermore, he betrayed our family. He's not worthy of life. He should be dealt with by the law. But the problem is... It's those who enforce the perfect law. They know shit about the law and enforce it. You put him in jail, and he'll be out in a few years. That's against the intent of the law. We have the right to enforce the law. That's justice. Justice of our own! You have a gun, right? Execute him in the name of the law. I'll take care of all the legal issues. The Criminal Code, Article 21-2, conditions for self- defense. 'When the benefit and protection of the law is violated... ' '... one acts accordingly to prevent it. ' Your life was threatened... ...which was against the benefit and protection of the law. That's self-defense. Teach him well. And be worth of your salt. This was an exercise. Expect what's coming. You... You didn't teach me. You bred me. As a dog... - Are you shitting me? - Stop it! I understand you were forced to do what you did. And that scumbag got what he deserved. However... I don't recall telling you to go after him. Was it personal? Write it down. You crossed the line here. You disobeyed my order and acted on your own. It's a report. Write down what I say. 'Captain SHIN ordered an investigation on OH Ju- tae' 'Facing him with a weapon in the middle of a pursuit... ' '... the use of a firearm was unavoidable. ' The Funeral What's this about? I just wanted to treat you to lunch. Let's go. That son of a bitch! Sit, Teacher. You son of a bitch! You have some balls to show up here! Let go of me. He killed my brother! - It's chaotic, isn't it? - You fucking killing machine! Why don't you kill me, you shit! Calm down. Please. It's not much, but help yourself. I couldn't get any lower in life. No matter what it was for, you pulled me out. You helped me get a career and a view on life. You always say students have duties to fulfill. By the same token, cops have theirs to fulfill. - What are you saying? - You picked a wrong guy. Like I said, I couldn't get any lower. Anyone who messes with me will get hurt. - Who messed with you? - Don't you know? Are you threatening me? You're my teacher. - I'm not your teacher. - Yes. You're the only teacher that I've ever had. Didn't you tell me? If you had had a teacher to guide you on the right path... ...you wouldn't have been where you are. And I have one. I have you. Help me. Give me a chance not to live like a dog. Let me live without being called names, Teacher! Tae-chun has looked after me for over 20 years. He hasn't. He just tamed you as a dog to train dogs. I guess so. And I've become useless. I took them from one of the boys. That's your lead. And do me a favor. Don't die. I don't wanna lose the only student of mine. It's good, but I won't like living on it. - Is it good? - Fuck! You again? Why do you keep bothering me? God damn it! Don't swear before a cop. Are you gonna arrest me for swearing? Go ahead if you can! Show me the pills. - What pills? - That Viagra you had. Viagra? You can't get it up? What a shame. They didn't work for me so I threw them out. If you cooperate... ...I'll tell my boss I found them on the street. Go find some then. I don't have any. You can beat me up if you find any on me. - You have 10 seconds. - 10 seconds, okay. - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. - Four. - Four. - Five. - Five. - Six. - Detective KOO. - Seven. - Wait! We're cool. You found them on the street, okay? Have some dumplings. Dip them in soy sauce. Smuggled in from China? They were made to look like fake Viagra. What an idea. Put together all the evidence that we've collected on him. Analyze all the leads carefully and thoroughly. We need to have the report for the prosecutor. It's same as before. A few more paragraphs won't make a difference. Pills that look like Viagra, that's all we have here. - It's solid evidence. - Captain SHIN. He has the best lawyers that money can buy. - This isn't good enough. - Let's arrest him first. - Arrest JANG Tae-chun? - Yes. - Have you located him? - We will now. There you go. You're at it again. Proceed with the investigation without him in custody. - Without him in custody? - Yes. Assaults, blackmailing, extortion, human trafficking... We can indict him with over 100 charges. Now he's involved in drug trafficking. He hires kids who are under 20. High school dropouts, mostly. Those kids are becoming felons because of him. He's been trying to make his businesses legitimate. If we don't get him now, we never will. You're a talker, aren't you? You're too sensitive and emotional. That's the problem. You think you're a vigilante protecting this society? The society works just fine without you. We don't have a case unless we have evidence. Do it again. Carefully and thoroughly. Get me evidence, not suspicion. This stack of files won't do us any good. Don't try to be a hero, or you get fucked. - Hello? - Hello, PARK. - Is this a good time? - Hold on. I think we're done here. It's okay. No problem. What are friends for? Who are you? Do you know who I am? Thomas Hobbs and Niccolo Machiavelli. What's the theory on human nature that they both addressed? Choices. There's none. What are you doing? The answer is the doctrine of original sin. Men are born with sins. Therefore, men should be beaten up to be forgiven. Get up. Teacher, why did you? You think I'm a fool? If a student strayed, you should've set him straight. KOO Dong-hyuk... He didn't stray. You have too much love for your student. Let me show you what a true teaching is about. You fuck me up, and you get fucked, too. Like this! What should I do with him? Should I bury him? He's useless to us. So he has no reason to live. Yes, sir. I've heard about the teacher. That's enough. No, sir. The order should be kept. The order? What's the order? It's my words. God damn it! Throw him out. You hit him, didn't you? No. I'm glad you did. It's not good for our investigation, though. - Hello? - Detective KOO. Yes. Let me tell you what shit you're in. Hold on. Bro! - Captain. - Yeah? Let me borrow the car. Sons of bitches! The great detective comes in. Dong-hyuk, it's been a while. Get him! Mom's not coming back. Stop crying! Dong-hyuk, when's Daddy coming home? You only have each other in this world. Even dogs don't bite their masters. What were you thinking, digging up our dirt? I'm your senior. I studied here, too. I was once a thug as well. So I understand you. Quite confusing, isn't it? Which is right and wrong? You know what? Nothing's right. I'm sure they forced you into it. I'll forget about it. Think of the future. If we stick together, nothing can stop us. And your brother over there will be proud of you. So proud of you. Nothing on earth is right. It's to kill or to get killed. Which are you gonna be? You come too often. When I was little... ...you lied to me that you were a cop. I believed you and told my friends that you were a cop. But... That watch you got me for my birthday... You stole it from our class monitor's house. You know how that made me feel? Why digging up the past? Then I decided... ...that I'd never lie to my son. That I'd tell him the truth... ...either a cop or a thief. There's a thin line between a cop and a thief. When a guy like you is a cop, it's the same thing. Dad. You know the difference between cop and a thief? A thief has no view on life. But a cop does. A thief dies a thief. And a cop dies a cop. Time's up. - Bye. - Wait, Dong-hyuk. I'm sorry. Stop coming here. It's embarrassing that you have a thief for a father. You've grown up. You're digging your grave. You have a minute to answer the question. If you fail, your damn mouth will be kissing the train. Where's JANG Tae-chun? - What? - There are no choices. Beats me. How should I know? I really don't know. 30 seconds left. I'm nothing but a minion. I don't know where he is. 20, 19... Wait! I can take a guess. 10, 9... I once drove CHO to this place. But I'm not sure if it's JANG's residence. Please, let me live. That's all I know. - You ready? - Am I ready? Yeah, ready to pick him up. Stay focused. It's not gonna be easy. You're worried about me? Time has come, sir. - You're finally free. - Yes. I think so. Hiding out isn't a good thing. But... ...there's one thing that bothers me. I raised a dog to guard the house. But that dog has forgotten his place... ...playing the master now. You misunderstood, sir. That'll never happen. I'm Captain SHIN, Homicide. JANG, you're under arrest... ...for drug trafficking and other countless charges. On what basis, Captain? We'll place him under our custody. That's when there's a possibility for him to stifle evidence. But there's no evidence against him. Don't worry, Captain. We have concrete evidence. What's that? It's all over the floor. What are you doing? This doesn't help our case! Captain. You know the 3rd law of the law of motion? Action and reaction. You treat a dog like a dog. You treat a trash like a trash. You son of a bitch! Watch your mouth to a cop. You've gone insane. You forgot? It was me who made you a cop. I'm not your dog. You knew each other? Put your gun down. Why do I feel that you've deceived me all along? Explain that first. Captain. You need to sacrifice for me. You didn't forget who you are, but it was too much. It's what you taught me. Pick up the gun. Pick it up. CHO! Sir? Start over from the bottom. You still have so much to learn. Yes, sir. Dong-hyuk, you don't deserve to be a cop. Cops never throw away their guns. Why? Because it's their responsibility, whatever it's sued for. You made things easier for me. Sir? Forgive me, sir. I'm too old to star over from the bottom, asshole! Why did you?! We could've made a great team. I'd like to blow your head this instance. But you need to be my dog once for all. Don't shoot! Go after them! - Senior. - 'Senior'? - You've violated the law. - What? Son of a bitch! Violation of Traffic Law. What the hell are you? - A cop. - And you shot your captain? I didn't shoot you, but the bulletproof vest. How do I trust you? I want a thorough report on my desk. We did a sting operation. He took your gun and shot me. I'm your boss. Do as I say. - Okay. - Hey. Did you have to be so damn crazy? I just enforced the law. - The law? - The Criminal Code, Article 21-2. 'When the benefit and protection of the law is violated... ' '... one acts accordingly to prevent it. ' Get up, Student. It's time to get up. You're not ready to learn. What the hell are you boys wearing? Do they recruit anybody these days? You have to have a view on life. Don't tell me you have one. 'A law is a law, however undesirable it may be. ' Socrates. Directed by CHOl Jin-won
