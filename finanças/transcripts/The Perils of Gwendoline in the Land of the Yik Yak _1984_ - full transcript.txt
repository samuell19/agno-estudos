- Bible? - Bible. - Paris. - Paris. Hey. Please, please. Miss Gwendoline. Oh, where is she? Where'd she go? Miss Gwendoline. Sorry. Watch out. Yuki, I don't care about what's in the crates, and I don't care about the bastard who shot at me, but what I don't like is being taken for a fool. So why don't you just give me my money and we'll call it even, okay? Because I'm such a nice guy. Come on. Atta boy. That's for your staff. Oh shit. Oh shit. My name is Gwendoline. That guy owed me 800 dollars. Here. Hi, Suki. Hey. No, no, it's okay. Miss. Oh Miss. The dirty sons of bitches, how dare they touch you? They tore my dress. - Oh look at that. - Oh please help me mend it, my mother gave this to me. Don't worry, I'm sure we can fix it. I knew I should never have let you make this trip. When I think of what could have happened. Yeah, he was wonderful. He had big blue eyes. Long light hands. A hero. That's not ours. But you have nothing left, how do you expect us to get along in this God forsaken place without money? We're not going to steal it. It had occurred to me, yes. All right, all right, your upbringing will be the death of us. Hide, quick. Beth. - Beth. - Right. You're having a nice winning streak, Willard. That's right, now I hope it goes on. Please sir, you gotta help us. They wanna kill us, they think I'm the one who killed - the girl. - You've gotta do something. Help me. I don't help nobody. Please. I feel seven. - What? - Get your hands off me. - Weirdos. - Let go of me. Please stop. Seven. I had a seven, damn. Bitch. You made me lose. Just because your boss fainted, don't go getting excited, okay? How can I ever thank you, sir? Look, you just cost me 60 dollars, so get out of here. Otherwise you're gonna be just like these beat up bags of yours. We won't leave. We need you. You better hurry up and go home before your mama gets worried. This was my mother's dress. She never even had a chance to see me in it. Really? Oh stop it. Listen, this girl traveled 4,000 miles in the hulls of a ship in order to find her father. What's your father do, anyway? He collects butterflies. Well, you're in luck. This man here is Mr. Cattochet. He's chief of police at Chuchail. He is? Police? Please, you have to help us. He protects and saves the mad dogs, missionaries, visiting Congress. - He's your man. - Stop it. Go and do a little strip tease up on the stage afterwards, we'll see if I can help you out. - No. - Hey, leave her alone. - Or else. - Or else what? Please, leave me alone. Okay. Black, you help us. Red, you never see us again. If it's red, you both are gonna strip tease. Yeah. We win. Stop it. Hey, leave her alone, we lost. I said, leave her alone, we lost. Here's a present for you. Let's go. Hey Shirko, I brought you some visitors. Go ahead, he's all ears. We're looking for a man. I know, the butterfly collector. Have you seen him? He wanted me to go with him on his expedition. I told him what he could expect. I had the impression, I've told him, to a horses ass about the price of eggs in China. All those risks for a fucking butterfly. But its father's whole life. If he manages to catch the butterfly, it will carry his name and all the journals will... I know all that. And I can show you where you can find your butterfly without a name. Here is the Katuhuan Region. - There is your Chien. - The Chien. It's swamps and jungles. Swamps. - The Chuchail River. - The Chuchail River sometimes plied by suspicious chunks. And then nothing, the Yik Yak. All that is the Yik Yak. And here is a map of the Yik Yak. Nothing. Just a few curves going somewhere, just to tell you that you're lost. Nobody goes there. Nobody goes there, and nobody comes back. Sometimes, a wind from the South Callibideou blows out of there, and people die. It's not my fault that your butterfly loves the Yik Yak. In the Yik Yak, isn't there an enormous crevasse with smoking gas coming up through it? So they say. But that's only a legend. A legend of Pikaho. That's how it is, in my dream. We have to go there. Have a nice trip. The last time I saw your father, he was in Dakoma. Take us to Dakoma. Sorry, sweetheart, this is the end of the line. I don't owe you a thing. Bye Shirka. Ah. You're going to jail, Willard. We found Yuki's body. It's got your name on it. And the broads don't have passports. Trying to be funny? I don't turn the other cheek, Willard. Hey big blue eyes. Can't you get off your ass and help us? Thank you. Hey big man, get us out of this. Stop it. - Put me down. - No, no. Put her down. Let go of me. What are you doing? Stop it, stop it. Come on, what did I tell you? Oh man, come on, what's wrong with you? Come on, scream. Oh. - Come on, you scream. - More, more, again. More? - Scream or I'll kill you. - More please. Oh women. Well. Thanks pal. Sh. Hey. I'll never forget what you've done for us. If I ever see either one of you again, you'll wish I hadn't. I told you to quit following me. Hey wait, I'm sorry, but you have to help us. - You can't leave us here. - Hey hey. Okay? Come on. Where? There's a boat down there that's leaving for Europe. Now be on it. Bon voyage, little girl. Believe me, it's better this way. Hey Willard, you got a light? Mao, he wants to see ya. Well I don't wanna see him. Why don't you tell him yourself? I hear you wanna talk to me? Ah, some more of your dirty business. There are plenty more like this. They don't take up very much room, but they're worth a fortune. There will be a trunk waiting for you. Now go, all by yourself. No taking them. Believe me, it's worth a fortune. How much for the trip? - Two. - Four. Three. Tsk tsk tsk. Three and a half. Ah, okay when? Tomorrow morning. We deliver the stuff. You know the place. Everybody knows. Oh, what did I tell you? - My father's in danger. - With a daughter like you, that doesn't surprise me. - Do you know how to swim? - No. Well start learning. Oh no. Are you ready for another lesson? Glad you like swimming so much. No, we're going to the Yik Yak. No, no please, stop. - Are you going? - Please, stop, stop. Stop. Nobody gives me orders. By the way, there's something I forgot to tell you. Two men came this morning with your packages. You were sleeping. So I told them not to make any noise. But don't worry, I took the packages for you. Well that's very kind of you. And if you're still here when I get back, maybe I'll give you a tow. Unfortunately, there's one problem. I can't for the life of me remember where I put them? Well wait a second Beth. Once we're dry, and we've found my father, don't you think we can make an effort to remember where it was? I mean, otherwise, this gentleman will never be able to step foot in the Yik Yak again, and it would be a pity. Bitch. Those packages of mine that you lost, they were in sacks like this, right? That's right. It's not the first time you've done this, hm? Now if I was you, I'd make myself real small. And I'm warning you. Once your father is found, you're on your own. May I come in? May I do something for you? Use this, and I expect it to be just as clean when you're through. Is that understood? Feel like dying? When I'm close to you, I feel safe. Well that's funny. When I'm close to you, I feel just the opposite. Well maybe they won't come. They're already out there some place. They're spying on us. I'm sorry we're so much trouble. Look, about the other night, our kiss. No one's ever kissed me before. I lost my head. I didn't know what I was doing. It's ridiculous, it's over. If something awful were to happen to either one of us, someone would be miserable. Love is too beautiful for it not to have... You know, you're luck you're a woman, because if a guy said that to me, I'd just break him in two. So why don't you go back down to your cabin, and play with your dolls or something 'til daddy lets you out, okay? Wait a minute, there they are. Cut it out, Taoto. You know there's pirates all over the place. And I don't feel like handing over my share. Two men for the bags, that's enough. I said two. This is hardly the time to start worrying about details, Taoto. I thought you trusted me. Hey Nina. Here's something to cut the strings with. Hey, hands off. Here, want this? Thanks for the help. What would I ever do without you? Willard. Yes, ma'am? Is that Dakoma? It's no Statue of Liberty, so I guess that's not New York. Jesus. Hey little big man, how's it going? Catch this. Tell Tom that Willard just blew in. Yeah. Hey, Tom, Tom. If your father was here, Tom knows about it. Any healings that go on here, it's his business. Now if he wasn't here, I'm not moving, 'cause this is the last stop before we get there. How would you describe your father, anyhow? Well, on expedition, he always wears the same thing. A white outfit, a brown hat with fishhooks all over it for good luck. - It was my mothers. - Willard. I can hardly believe my eye. You old river rat. Where'd you come from? Miss, help me. Oh dear. Tom, where'd you get that outfit? And he was found caught on a tree root along the edge of the river. From the condition of his body, he'd looked as if he'd been wandering up there. Up in Kiops territory. I remember the night before we found him. The Callibideou was blowing like the devil. He was undoubtedly a victim of superstition and native magic. What do you mean? I'm not really so sure it's a story she ought to hear. You tell her, go on. Go on. The Callibideou is a wind which brings poison clouds. You cough, you throw up, and then you can die. In their fear, the Kiops think that by offering human sacrifices, the wind will go down and leave them in peace. You mean he sacrificed my father to calm the spirits of the wind? The strange thing is that, the Kiops are convinced that only a male sacrifice will appease their gods. They tie 'em alive to a big spiderweb they built in the desert. And the Callibideou comes, and takes the body. And they really disappear, never to be seen again. End of story. But what I don't understand is that, I'm almost sure your father's wound was made by a bullet. No Kiops has ever owned a gun before. Maybe a dealer? That's impossible. A dealer wouldn't be interested. No money in it. You know, I think your father was the only white man who's ever gotten so far. And all that for a butterfly? I tell you, I wouldn't do it for 1,000 dollars. And for 2,000? Well, I'd never seen that kind of money. At least not all at once. Well on your feet, Willard, 'cause we're leaving tomorrow morning. Yeah, leaving for where? For the Yik Yak. What the hell you gonna do in the Yik Yak? You found your father, didn't you? I'm gonna catch that butterfly. It's gonna bear his name. It was his whole life's dream, and I'm gonna make it mine. No, you can hunt your insect by yourself. - Scared? - You got the money? Tomorrow morning. Tom, you come with me. And you go take a bath. You stink. But where is she going to find the money? Come on, come on, come on. If Willard happens to get wind of this, I'm dead. You'll get double your money back. All I have to worry about now is that Mao won't get wind of it, either. Otherwise, I die twice. It's a great business you're in. All that perfectly good money going right down some drain. For a stupid butterfly. Have you thought about it? Nobody ever came back from Yik Yak. What are you gonna do with those labels? I believe that's mine. This is for supplies. That is your business, too. It is for a nice girl like you. Place your bets. You'll be a winner. Come on, come on. Ready, go. Willard. You're too damn much. I could've lost. Get up, let's go. And don't bother counting. This isn't the time or the place, and it's all there. I'd like to know where you got the money. Yeah? Well you'd be disappointed to find out. I'm waiting. Gentlemen. Sorry folks. What's so funny, uh? I'll do anything for science. Willard. Where are you? Oh there's one. He's sleeping. Oh damn, just a lizard. You're lagging. Oh, oh, ow. Getting in shape for the big butterfly hunt. Rigorous training. Willard, stop it. You're going too fast. You're doing that on purpose. As long as you're at it, fill this. Ah. I might feel like taking a bath tonight. Well, this is the gateway to hell, your hell. I don't suppose you'd like to sit or stop, maybe get a drink? No, no, no. Oh, you too? Bye bye, world. Let's go. I thought we were rationing the water. Hm. Hey Gwendoline. Don't move. Whatever you do, don't move your foot. Beth, give me your canteen. The sepris arantis, the rose of the desert. Three drops of water, it can live for 30 years. You're crazy. What's gotten into you? Look, things being as they are, if we haven't found your butterfly by the time we've finished the second canteen, we're going home. You're a swine, Willard. I guess that's why I hired you. You're gonna help me find my butterfly we made a deal. - Yes that's right. - A deal? Well that seems to be a strange word out here, - don't you think? - Now look it. I'm ordering you to continue. And what's more? You're gonna carry Beth. And when I get tired, you're gonna carry me. Look, I don't mind walking. - Don't, I mean. - Lots of luck, red. Look, I don't give a damn about your insect, - or your family quest. - Listen. Here I am stuck out - in this hell hole. - Will you listen to me? - Where nobody's ever been. - Come on, please come back. Traipsing around with some school girl and a silly nurse mate, - and a butterfly net. - Hey. Isn't what happened to your father enough? Stop that, oh please come back. You can't leave us here. Willard, you're going on with us as long as I say because nothing is going to stop me. You are nothing but a no good, - little stinking opportunist. - No, no. Now look. I always hated goodbyes. Oh please don't go. Now would probably be a good time to count your money. You never know. Alright, and don't get so excited, because you'll get the real thing when we get back. Let's go, Beth. Wow. Nice work, Willard. We're going a lot faster now. It's easy. Every time I swing this machete, I picture your neck underneath the blade. Wait a minute. This is to mark of trail. Somebody's been here. Could it have been my father? No, it's too fresh for that. Out of my way. You're not my type. Is that a boa? No, it's a goldfish. Ooh. Are you sure this is the right way? If you don't trust me, ask him. Hey, where are you? Oh, wait for me. What's he doing? He's gone mad. Take your clothes off quick. I said take 'em off. He's crazy, we're catch the flu. Would you rather die of thirst? Well, how's it going? Oh, forget it. Go get some wood, branches, roots. Anything you can find. We've got to make a fire. Here. Where'd you get this? I don't remember, why? We've got to find it again. Oh. It was right about here. I've seen these cases before. Whoever it was, they were in a hurry. Well, we'll go on anyway. Stand up straight. I guess it's better that way, huh? Willard. Wait. Haven't you ever been in love with anybody? Yeah, with every woman in the world except you. Nobody tells me the way to live my life. I live my life the way I choose. I wasn't asking you to change. You know, the first time I met you, you reminded me of this panther I freed from a trap. She was perfect, like a woman. Her eyes beautiful, and she followed me everywhere I went. And then one day a hunter killed her, and I cried. Ha, how embarrassing. I was such a jerk. What's that I hear? Keep quiet. Sounds like a... Water. Come back. - Hey, let me go. - Get up. Stop that. What are you, come on. Thank you, how did you know? Gut instinct. I'm infallible. Come on. - Come on. - Some people are just born... They're Kiops. They're cute, aren't they? Hi chief. Are those your father's? They were a gift from my mother, for his last trip. And is that the mark of your ridiculous butterfly on his forehead? Look, all I know is we're getting closer. Oh, good. Now we can die in peace. Are you alright? Yes. Oh. Are they going to kill us? The Kiops don't do their own killing. Tonight, they're gonna get their dogs excited, and tomorrow, they're gonna see how you run. Now, if you can run faster and longer than a dog, you might get to see my money again. If you do, give it a kiss for me, will ya? What about you? I'll be perfect for the spider webs when the winds come up from the south. That way, they don't have to sacrifice their own. Tomorrow, when you run, if the dogs haven't caught you after 300 yards, start zig-zagging, because that way the dogs get confused, and they run out of breath faster. - But do we have a chance? - Are you kidding? Willard. Will you forgive me? Oh ask me anything, but don't ask me that. I don't wanna sleep badly my last night on Earth. Willard. Oh, it's a little late to start being afraid, don't you think? I mean, what did you think that was, a hike in the country, a little picnic? Maybe tomorrow when the dogs start ripping out your stomach, then you will curse your butterfly. That's enough, Willard. Keep your remarks to yourself. You're only heroic when it comes to money. Gwendoline. I want you to know that if I was your father, up in Heaven, I'd be proud of you. If we get out of here, we're gonna find that butterfly for you. We're gonna find the biggest butterfly we can, and I'm gonna give it your name. Willard, please forgive me anyway. Gwendoline. Have you ever made love? No. I mustn't let you die without making love. Come as close as you can. Closer. No. Don't be afraid. Come as close as you can to me. You're shivering. I'm starting to kiss your neck. Don't open your eyes. Are you feeling my kisses on your neck? Oh, your lips are so beautiful. Now I'm caressing your hair. Feel me caress your hair. Oh, my hands, going down your body. Feel my hands on your body. Yes, that's right. Oh, it feels so good. Every nerve. Every nerve in your body's alive. Your body is blossoming into your own hand. Oh, you feel good. Don't be ashamed of how good you feel. Now very gently, I'm starting to come on top of you. Feel my skin. Feel the weight of me on top of you. My desire inside your body. My desire is spreading through you. Filling our whole beings with warm pleasure. You're so warm. Now faster. Yes, faster. Faster. Yes. Move faster. Now faster. Faster. Beth? Beth. Okay. Hey. No, oh no. - No, no, no. - I'm getting plenty mad. I'm mad, mad, mad. I'm sick of walking and running and climbing and falling. It's too much. I just wanna catch this butterfly and go on home, and to be left in peace. We'll walk around and stuff, but even if one of you silly little pip squeaks interferes with us, he'll get punched in the face. It's really a scandal when a person can't take a peaceful walk in the jungle without being hassled. I tell you, no no no. Come on, let's go. I can't handle any more. She's right. They were becoming a pain. Hey, this way. What? Come on. - Oh. - Uh oh. Past the spider webs. We're safe. Yeah, for the time being. From now on, it's the Yik Yak. Oh here it comes. - What? - What? That's what it involves. Son of a bitch. The Callibideou. Get down, get down, take cover. Get down, get down. Don't breathe, don't breathe. Get down. Get down. Cover your face. Don't breathe in the poison. Put something in your mouth. You're gonna die if you don't. I don't wanna die. You never know. Hey, you guys okay? You're not dead or anything? Well, if you know somebody who like solitude and wide open places, you can always give them this address. Oh. We're here. This is it. I'm sure of it. The feet in the sand, the body being dragged. The butterflies are right over there, inside that crevasse. Oh this is magnificent. Now what's she doing? It's the sun. - Come on. - Stop her. I can't believe it. Oh, it's exactly like in my dream. Come on. - Come on. - Wait, hey. It's the Callibideou. We have to stop her then. There's no bar, but it's not bad. Come on, we'll catch the butterfly, and then we could just go home. You really think your insect is down there? Sure, all I need is something to throw in. Not my hat. What are we waiting for? Who's got the net? I've got it. - Okay. - Okay. - Just a second. - I can't, I can't believe we made it. Okay, I'll go down first. Your hand, sir. Woops. Willard, have you ever been to London? Oh, you'll see. - We'll have such a good... - look, if I was a butterfly, and I lived here, and somebody tried to take me to London, I'd break their face. Just because we had one romantic moment together, don't start sending out wedding invitations. Oh I see. So the other night was just a game for you. - I can't... - Okay. You're horrible. Damn it, I don't need you anymore because I can do this myself. I got it, I got it. It's splendid, come down and see. Yeah, yeah. Hey, whoa whoa whoa whoa. Ah. Beth? Beth? Beth? Are you alright, Beth? - Beth, Beth. - Beth. Beth, you gotta do something. - What? - I don't know. Make a passage to get through. Bethy Beth. Oh that's clever. It could happen to anybody. Oh just help me. - Willard, she's dying. - Well you go tell her parents she died because of a butterfly. By the way, you never told me. How does your dream end? Hey, over there's a passage. Not one man. Only women. Yeah. What are you gonna do about finding Beth? Hm? Oh no. Yes. Shit. Those girls are gonna spot me right away. They've all got these enormous tits. Will you relax? Even with your beard, you're still very ravishing. I am fed up with you. I'm gonna through you over this cliff, you can join your butterfly, and you can join your friend Beth, and you can go back to your spoiled childish tricks. Just you go ahead, only you'll be sorry. Because you're not gonna get your money back. You wanna know why I got those 2,000 dollars, huh? I sold all your stuff to Tom. Well Tom always was a sellout. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well your death will be worse than mine. You're a coward, and you don't care about other peoples feelings. Feelings are for creeps. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well you good for nothing. You run from reality 'cause you just think you're above it. And you'll never know how to say I love you. Bye, Gwendoline. I'm not worth your trouble. Go ahead, drop me. But it'll be your name I scream on the way down. I belong to you. Body and soul. You're kidding. No wait. Let go. Come on, Gwendoline, be reasonable. I can't see that kind of thing. OH no, Gwendoline, I love you. Oh. I hope that was sincere. Let's get going. - Hey look. - Come on. Please. Will you stop it. Wait a minute, those look like diamonds, don't they? Come on. Now I get it. All this machinery is for mining diamonds. The legends of Pikaho is true. Oh I love your butterfly. What? Let's find Beth, and let's get out of here. We're rich. Please, Willard. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, ladies, hey, hey. Stop it. Let go of him. Hey hey hey hey. Get off of him, you perverts. Hey hey hey hey. Stop it. Willard. Hey. This way. There, I'll hold 'em off. Hey, come on. Kiops. Yes. Kiops. Storm. It's real. I wasn't dreaming. Now I get it. Spider webs. I really can't leave you alone for five minutes, can I? I just upped my price. Look out. Will. Beth? Beth. Beth. Oh. Alright. Just breathe. Trust me. Come on. Go on, don't worry about me. Have you lost something, Gwendoline? Oh, you're very pretty for an outsider. Stand up so I can see you better. Welcome to our little community. We don't often have visitors here. Free Beth immediately. Hm, Beth. Her name down here is UXAT9. What? Your friend is being punished, Gwendoline. I was asking her some very innocent questions. Only she refused to talk. It's too bad. I seldom find occasion to practice your enchanting language from the old world. Why did you come to our city? To catch a butterfly. And who came with you? Nobody. Lying is against all of my rules. In any kingdom, there must be a strict system of discipline. Every single one of these girls sneaked out the city walls to find a man without my permission. I don't let anybody here disobey orders. Take her away and untie the other one. I've been waiting for you. Superb, you're superb. Now how am I to introduce you, D'Arcy? Just call me D'Arcy as usual. What do you think of her? Superb. She looks superb. That's enough, D'Arcy. And me, me. - Tell me how I look. - Superb, you're superb. If I may. I'm honored to meet you, and I bid you welcome here. You really are a stupid fool, D'Arcy. I've explained a million times, you don't kiss a young girl's hand. You must forgive him, Gwendoline. He's terribly ill-mannered, I fear. Ah, but it's true, he's right. You really are superb. It's not very smart of you to refuse my friendship, Gwendoline. It's your only chance. Look here, you can stop your dumb games, you assholes. I came here to free Gwendoline, and I haven't got time to chat all day. I've got things to do. This is Willard, I suppose. One doesn't make propositions in your situation. Don't you agree, D'Arcy? Superb, you're superb. Okay, listen. You free Gwendoline, I take her away, and we forget everything. Gwendoline, are you willing to forget everything? I believe you came out here to capture a butterfly. - Yes, for my father. - Oh yes. That old explorer who kept wandering around. He said that's what he came after, too. D'Arcy, do you remember? I remember everything that you make me do. Bring Willard down here. Smile, Gwendoline. I hate people who pout. That's better. By any chance, my dear Gwendoline, do you know about the legend of the Pikaho? Mm mm. And you, Willard? Never heard of it. Explain it to Gwendoline here. You're a marvelous storyteller, I'm sure. Don't know it. This might refresh your memory. In the 12th Century, the Chinese have it that an angry mountain began spitting out showers of diamonds. The Earth cracked open, and the mountain was swallowed up, and no one has seen Pikaho since. According to the legend, there were no survivors, but I notice that didn't keep a few bastards from taking advantage of the situation. Oh charming, Willard. I adore educated men. Don't we, D'Arcy? Very educated. But it also said that the mountain would take vengeance on all who tried to plunder it. So be careful, amateur scientist, or it'll blow up in your face. Impossible, I worked out every detail. So you came to hunt the butterfly, too? That's right. I've got an agreement with the lady here. What do you think of him? Superb, he's superb. You are beaten, Willard. But I'm a good sport, you see, and so I will give you a place in the legend. When the Earth moved, our city was in ruins. There were a few survivors. Mostly women. And a few men who soon began dying off for some unknown reason. I sometimes use men like you Willard so that my civilization won't disappear. D'Arcy will organize the contest. Only my best girls will be allowed to compete. The one who is victories will be yours for the night. Give her a child. I want a male. Why don't you ask your pet handyman to do it instead? Unfortunately, for him, he can't do much in that area. So here, if a girl wants to make love, she has to prove herself? If I accept, then you've got to free Gwendoline. Oh afterwards, you can do as you like, but you won't have very much strength left. Oh, that's a low blow. Give me all your women, and tomorrow you'll be overpopulated. Don't boast about it, young man, 'cause in your place, I'd prefer to be in mine. That's enough, D'Arcy. We don't need your advice. Don't resist. Let yourself go. In here, our only pleasure is love. There's no reason to resist. You have nothing left to fight for. Forget the man you came here with. Willard? But why? In here, it is the custom that after his copulation, a man must die. When nature transformed our mountain, it also transformed our loss. After we've had sex, when the male pricks, the female kills him during ecstasy. I don't want him to die. You're crazy, you'll never reach him. Look, it's my fault that he's here. Sh, look, don't you see? You'll just g... Beth. Oh Beth, I'm sorry. Willard. These girls are the elite of my people. Look at them. Ready to spill their blood for a brief moment of passion with you. Choose what you like. I don't wanna choose. Perfect, that makes four. Run. Over here. Bye bye. Gwendoline. Well go on, catch her. Stupid idiots, go. Get after her, kill her, kill her. Give me that. We'll get Beth, find a door, and get out of here. Oh where is a free one? No. Listen, you're gonna be killed. - I'll be fine. - No, you're gonna be... You're driving. When you make love... Watch out. Go away. Whoa. After a man makes love here, he dies. What? Beth. Get her helmet. Now. Gwendoline must kill Gwendoline. That's right. And you'll take her place in the contest. It's the only way to save Willard. Now throw her down there. But I don't know how to fight. Sh. Courage. Oh. No. Poor thing, poor little Gwendoline. I saw the whole fight. It was splendid. Unbelievable, supernatural. Please, will you be quiet, D'Arcy? Too bad for you. Willard, she was hopeless, totally without class. You know you can do better. You'll barely miss her. You don't understand anything. You're dead already. You're a coward, you don't know how to feel. You don't know how to tell someone I love you. I leave that to losers, as you'd say. Yeah, well then I must be a loser, because I've lost everything, everything. And you'll get nothing from me, you over-dressed gargoyle. - Nothing. - D'Arcy, you don't have permission to laugh. Yes, superb, you're superb. I'll bring your ugly mountain down on top of you. I'll kill you, you ugly bitch. You're as good as dead. D'Arcy, prepare this young lady and the others for the contest. Naturally, I want everything perfect. Oh Gwendoline. Farewell, my pretty. All of those girls have been in combat training. You haven't got a chance. Give up the idea of fighting. Come with me. I'll blow up the city and we'll escape together. If not, you'll be killed by the queen. And this time, she won't hesitate. You killed my father. You grovel in front of her. You're nothing but shit. Superb. She was superb. She drove the men wild. I was just a humble physicist who had nothing at all. I wanted her so badly. To win her, I gave up everything to go looking for her famous Pikaho. And there she took advantage of my love for her, and turned me into what I am today. She forced me to do things which are forbidden by the laws of nature. But now that I'm capable of controlling the energy in the volcano, then I can unleash the fury of its entrails. I can dominate the queen. I'll take her and crush her in one of her own horrible machines. I'll go back to a world of normal humans, where wealth gives you another kind of power. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? Courage. Gwendoline, you're my courage. Forget this nightmare, forget the butterfly. You see those. They're all linked up to my machinery. And when I push that button, the Earth will open, and the lava will give us its forge, and when I push that other one, the Earth will close up again, and then the mysterious legend will be truly a legend. - Come with me, and I can... - You make me sick. You could have knocked before you came in. Here's your knock for you. This was wandering about. Do something original with her. Gargoyle. Beg your pardon? Superb, you're superb. Good boy. What are you waiting for? What have you done with Willard, D'Arcy? You'll see. Oh, not bad, D'Arcy. Not bad at all. Cut away. Oh, naughty canary. These girls are going to battle over your favors and their comeback, without rules. The winner will be yours. Do us of giving the honor of giving the starting signal. Go on. I think it's all lovely. Don't you, Willard? I'd love to be down in that arena with you. Ah. Let's bid on 'em, Willard. - Choose the color. - I'll bet on you're dead, as soon as I manage to get out of here. Meanwhile, I'll be on the loser, 'cause I think she's gonna win. You're making a big mistake. You'll lose your bet, Willard. The ring is already in trouble. I'll kill you, anyway. You are too optimistic. It's most annoying. Oh, you're trembling, afraid. You are, too. Take off your helmet so the queen can see your face before you die. No. Bastard, stop this massacre. The queen's will is the will of the queen. Anyway, this is boring. I'm not at all amused. That's your loss. But all you want is violence. That will defeat you. I must say, I hope you have something more original and picturesque afterwards. It's quite classic, but it's your type of thing. You will see. Ah, this is something new. Yes, it's a surprise. Don't say anything, I'll protect you. I promise you'll win. You must win. But Beth, I don't want you involved. Stay behind me. I'm here to help you. It's the two of us. Beth, I don't... Be careful, alright? Now. - I can't go on. - Yes, you can, you have to. We have no choice. Come over, come here. Green will never win, Willard. Never say never. - Green one is superb. - No. I mean, the yellow one is superb. She's going to die. Ah. You won the bet and you won the girl, Willard. Tonight, we'll see what kind of a champion you are. On your feet. Now take off her mask. Let her wear it 'til the ceremony. The suspense is greater that way. Oh, not bad, D'Arcy. You're getting more creative. I know how fond you are of surprises. Psst. Beth, are you crazy? You're risking your life. That's not important. I wanted to see you one last time. I'll never forget you. You were wonderful. I don't know what's going to happen to me, but I'll try to be as strong as you are. I wish I could do something for you now. I'm scared. But you just have to find Willard and you're free. Oh please. Hey, come on. It's not the moment to fall apart. - I'm scared, Beth. - Scared? After what you've done. How do you make love to a man? Oh listen, it's much easier to make love than fight four warriors with your hands tied behind your back. How? Remember that night with the Kiops? Well, Willard, no, well it's the same thing, but not the same thing. - That is... - I'm just afraid I'm gonna do everything wrong. Put on your helmet, quick. Gwendoline, you don't stand a chance. The queen will see through your disguise and have you killed. I can win. If you have any feelings for me. You doubt me. I'm here to take you away with me. For you, I'd do anything. Betray the queen. You betray everybody. Why don't you just leave me alone, and knowing you, you're not going anywhere without your diamonds. All my pretty stones. They're nothing without you. I've set the machine going. I'll make you the world's wealthiest woman. You'll have everything you want. The diamonds of Pikaho will never make me beget Pikaho. Gwendoline, I can make you happy. Just let me love you. Forget it. There is nothing I can do for you. She tried to destroy me. But even so, I am capable of love. I have feelings and desires like other men. Leave me alone. Come with me, Gwendoline, please, - or I'll tell the queen every... - Pervy old man. Now D'Arcy has disappeared. I have to be everywhere at one. What is this masquerade? You know, I'm sick of you. You can't make love like everybody else. No, you need to have whips, and tortures, and battles. You know, there's something really sick in your brain. Hey, why don't you come down here and let me squeeze your head, and let that shit run out, okay? There's no need for vulgarity. You can save your criticism for later when you may need it more. You think you're so cool. I'm not gonna make love with anybody. Knowing your uncooperative nature, I was prepared for that. You really can't make me rise to the occasion. Oh, I haven't trained specialists all these years for nothing. I'm sure they'll get a reaction out of you. You're sick. It will do no good to resist, Willard. - Hey hey hey hey. - Drink it. - It's just a harmless potion. - Hey hey hey, no. The time has finally come, Willard, to reveal why D'Arcy giggles, and why he's so glad he's not in your place. Is the potion starting to take effect? Good. Know then, Willard, that any man who is allowed to make love in my kingdom only does it once. When he's finished, he must die. That's the law of Pikaho. No. Bring in the mixer. No. Oh no, no. No, no, no. I'll make you the richest woman in the world. Stupid creep. No, wait a second, I have something to tell you. - Go on. - But can't you untie me? I'm listening. I've set it going. I've pushed the button. The entire mountain's going to explode. No one will have the diamonds. The volcano will block up the entrance, and all of you will be destroyed. There will be nothing left but the desert. Pikaho will return to legend forever. Well how much longer is there? No, no. No. Willard. Gwendoline? What did he say? - Yes. - Gwendoline. Willard. Gwendoline, oh, yeah. Yes. Let's go, let's go. Oh, what an idiot that D'Arcy is. I don't see a thing. But that's never been part of the act. Oh, but what is that imbecile up to? This is dreadful. Oh, D'Arcy will regret this. That'll be enough of that. Take off your mask. Willard must see the face of his exterminator, quickly. No. Gwendoline has broken your power, and now the mountain is seeking its revenge. You will die. You lost everything, you gargoyle. Gwendoline. Beth. Take this, we have to hurry. D'Arcy freed the volcano. Everything is going to blow. - Hurry, hurry. - Follow me. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Asshole. This way. No, I'm not sure. Come on. This way. - Let's run. - You go run, I'll catch up. Don't go in there, it's blowing up. We've had enough bad memories here. I'm getting some good ones. Don't be another D'Arcy, god damn it. - Forget your diamonds. - Be careful. Willard, Willard, - Willard, Willard. - Gwendoline. - No. - Gwendoline. No, Willard. Willard. Oh no, please, miss. There's nothing we can do to help him now. Gwendoline, it's our last chance. Come on. It's this way. Be careful. Willard. Willard. It can't be true. Willard? Willard. Stop. You still owe me 2,000 dollars. Butterfly.
