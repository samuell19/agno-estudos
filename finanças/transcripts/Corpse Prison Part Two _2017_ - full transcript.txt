Presented by: Corpse prison production committee new select takeshobo crei Leone Previously, on "corpse prison: Part 1" previously, on "corpse prison: Part 1" hold her down! Hold her down! You bitch! It must have been a long trip for you. I'm amano, the village chief. Thank you for allowing us to hold our seminar field work here. "Foot amputation"? It's a ceremony to welcome women from the outer world. Now they are brides of yasaka village. Takahiko. Over here. Pour my glass. We were worried whether you'd really keep your promise or not. What is it? What's going on?! That's isuke, who takes care of my bedridden wife. He's a bit slow. I put towel here. Thank you very much. Gosh, I'm pathetic. Those girls have no idea what's going on? I know. We must do something. You used the girls as a bargaining chip. That's what the chief asked for. He asked me to bring him young women... In exchange for full support in the research. He wanted to find a bride for his son. Mitsuha, don't do such a vulgar thing. It feels so good! What if they catch us off guard and escape? Make sure they don't. At any rate, until he finds his bride... You won't lay a finger on those girls. No... The girl is cursed. Once you get married, I'll offer her to sarutahiko. But... Enough! Just pick your bride. God knows what the villagers might do if you don't act swiftly. Any convenience stores around here? There are plenty of them. There are? Could you take us there? Sure. We were just about to go there. All right. Hello? Anyone in there? Professor... Leave the village at once. Otherwise, misfortune will befall you. Stop it! No! Don't worry. The villagers won't know about this. They still have three girls there. That's enough for that scrawny son. Hold it! No! Hina! Run. This village... bad. What about the others? Will they be raped too? Then, I can run away alone. I need to warn everyone. Where am I? Don't worry. Nobody could get out of the forest without a guide. Please don't kill anymore. Promise me. Would you like to leave this attic? But I might not be able to return here for a long time. Hey! Over here! Come on! Help me, god. Six hundred years ago, this village was secluded from the world. There were very few baby girls, probably due to incest. After repeated famines and epidemics, the village ultimately lost all of its female population. Then, one day a couple visited the village. The villagers... Considered the couple as a gift from their god, sarutahikonokami. They killed and ate the man, and raped the woman. They cut off the foot of the woman, and made her their comfort woman. She gave birth to babies of many men in the village. Her leg was infested with maggots, so she was called the "maggot lady." Maggot lady her leg was infested with maggots, so she was called the "maggot lady." Her leg was infested with maggots, so she was called the "maggot lady." They continued to do the same to other women that visited the village. Communization of these women became a norm and a custom. The babies born there were still all boys. The villagers thought they were cursed by past maggot ladies. So, they built a shrine for her... And worshipped her as amanouzume, who had a connection with sarutahiko. But the curse hasn't been broken, and no baby girl has been born since. So, this village had to continue to hunt women. It's just an old tale. Of course it's just an old tale. I need to talk to you two. Please follow me. Get the girls out of here. Got it? Just go! Hurry! A woman has escaped! Me. Isuke. It's okay. He's on our side. What's "women hunting"? It's a custom of this village. Any news? They haven't come, but they will soon. This is the only way out from the village. I'm heading that way. We'll trap them from both sides. Corpse prison: Part 2 Sarutahikonokami... is gone. Did you all do this? Well... who's to say? You know, Mr. chief... this village is insane. You must know that. I don't believe in god at all. That's what got me interested in folklore. What is the "god" that people hold in their hearts? I wanted to find out. Oh, there is a god. It wasn't god that made this village. It was the village that created god... A blasphemous god. What do you know? About any of it? You have to break the curse you don't understand nothing! Mr. devil! Here I am! La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... Oh, jeez! There, right there! Awesome! You did it! Good morning! Good morning. Come help us out, mikoto. But, we have to hurry and get out of here. We'll be fine. This is a secret place only isuke knows about. Secret... hideout. Whoa, there's a big one! Isuke, over there! You did it! Hey, what are you doing?! Jeez. Ah, there it is! It's boxed in! Get it! Over there! Look, look! Nice! Yes! He hasn't come back since yesterday. I see. Apparently, he put on the uzume mask and attacked some of the men in the village. Oh... You're making him do this, aren't you, mom? Don't ask me... Isuke is your older brother. It's because of the way he is, that I've kept it a secret. I've always known. I thought as much. That boy is... He's kind at heart. He can't live here in this village. And neither can you. Right? Take isuke with you and leave this place. I can't. If I could, then everyone would have done so already. You came from the outside, so you don't understand. The men of this village can't leave here. They'll die imprisoned. No one can escape uzume's curse. Where are those girls? The girls! Where are they? Here. For you. Thank you. It's delicious! Did you catch all these yourself, isuke? He didn't just catch them: He got them by hand. This is just the wild sort of boyfriend I've always wanted! "Boyfriend"? I'm just kidding. Wait, are you blushing? Cut that out already. This isn't the time for fooling around. We need to hurry. Not to worry. Isuke knows this mountain like the back of his hand. Right? Hand. Hina... Hina. Hina! Hina, wait! Hina! Wait up! Hina! Sayori? The hell? I don't know. I'm gonna go look for her, so wait here. Sayori! Sayori! Hina? Hina! C'mon, wait! Hina! Hina! Hina, wait! Hina! C'mon, wait, hina! Hina, wait! Sayori! Sayori! Hina? Hina, where are you? Hina! Hina! Hina! Huh? Hina...? Hina. Hina! Hina! Hina, hina! No! No, no! No! Hina! No! Hina! No, no! No! Sayori? Hey, isuke. I told you to let us know when you find the girls, didn't 1?! Well, whatever. You did good. Now, that's a girl... that's my girl! Hey, isuke, help me carry her. Stop it! Stop it! What's with you?! That's my girl! My girl! Isuke, no! Hey, tagishi! What's going on? Hurry up and get over here! Hey! What is it?! Over here! Hurry! Don't let her get away! Get her! Hey! Come on, get up! Come on! No... Come on! She's already dead. Come on! Hey. My knife... Did you do this? What's gotten into you? Hina? Hina, where are you? Hina? Hina? I wonder where everyone went... I think we should go look for them. We have to stay here. Without isuke, we'd only get lost. But... Don't you move! You're not getting away! Hina! Hina, where are you? Hina? Oh, jeez. So this is where you've been. I swear... Say, do you remember this? Huh? It's a love letter from you, from when we were in middle school. "Hey, so..." "You may hate me for writing this, but I like you. I really like you." Stop it! "And not as a friend: I love you! I'd do anything for you, even die." Come on, stop. "It doesn't matter if you don't like me back. You don't have to do anything..." "But I hope you'll always let me be by your side." I'm embarrassed. Sayori. We'll be together forever. I'm so happy. Chief! Please hurry and choose the kid's wife. I caught these two. So whichever one is left should be my-! And what happened to takahiko? How the heck should I know?! But we risked our lives to hunt these girls! Our friends have been killed! So please hurry up and choose! I can't take this anymore! Stop acting like you're entitled! But, chief! I owe you for last night. By the way, where is that professor right now? The proud and noble tenno family has no place for a harlot the likes of you. Hey! Do whatever you like with this one. All right! Take her to the uzume hut. Still, of course it had to be the old one! Quit complaining! This one'll do just fine. If you don't want it, I'm all over that! You're talkin' crazy. I'm the one who caught her. Like I'd let you bastards have her! It's you who'll be takahiko's wife. No! Truth is, right from the start, I reckoned you'd be a good fit. So... Please, look after takahiko. Go on and take them clothes off, please. You'll be the bride to my one and only son. Havin' scars and whatnot on you just won't do. No... no... no! Do it now, please. Take them pants off too. You got one beautiful body. Don't you worry. I won't do anything to ya. When takahiko gets back, you two will be consummatin'. It don't matter how slow he is: When he sees this body, he won't be able to contain himself. No...I Professor?! The chief told you guys to get rid of that thing, didn't he? Professor! No! Professor! We've been busy huntin' those girls. We'll bury the body later. Professor! Prof- shut up, dammit! No! Let's go. C'mon. Hey, help me! You're gonna let us have a turn with her too, right? Okay, fine, just do something! All right! Off with these clothes! Tits! And these tits are awesome! No! Stop! Stop! Hey... help me. They've got you trapped in here too, right? Let's get out of here, together. Okay? Help me... Help me! Ow! Ow, it hurts! Ow! Ow... Ow, ow, ow! Just... fine, whatever. Just pull it out. Do it, now! Here goes. One, two, three... shit! Ow... ow! Ow... it hurts! I... I think I'm done for. Isuke... you look pretty handsome right now. No... no! It's not... like this would even be enough to kill me, right? I guess I'm hungry. That was fast. Sa... giri! I'm sorry... Hey, tagishi! How many times do you plan on bonin' her?! Jeez! Shut up! This... this girl is mine! Cut the crap already! Girls belong to the whole village, dammit! Hey, cut it out! Isuke? Isuke! Isuke! Calm down! Calm down, okay? We... we're friends, right? We're friends! I ain't done nothing wrong! Nothing! The god who made this village is the one to blame! Right?! And... oh, yeah, I've got a girl in there! I'll let you do her too! Okay? And she's fine! She's got great tits! So... what are you going to do now? Kill... everyone. Oh. Give it your all. I'll be fine, so just hurry up and go. Please. Damn... I'm tired of tagishi bein' the only one who gets to have fun. I'm sure our time will come soon. I can't wait no more! There should be some other of them girls left. The kid's already got his wife... the first one who sees it, gets to please it. A bear? We're finally alone, huh? Huh? Of course, I understand. Wait... isuke did that? Yeah. Weren't no doubt, it was isuke! He finally done gone wrong in the head! Wait, what about takahiko? What happened to takahiko?! Don't tell me that isuke-! I'm right here. Takahiko... where have you been? Out walking. Well, never mind. Come on in. Your woman is waiting for you. You all! Takahiko is about to take his bride to bed for the first time. Not isuke, not no one, steps one foot in here! I'm sure you're hungry. Eat. Sir. Word is isuke's been out there killin' the village people. You best watch yourself. Sir. Even the girls. He's been out there killin' the girls. It wasn't isuke who killed those girls. What're you talking about? It's nothing... Whatever. Your bride is safe and sound. I chose the best one for you. And I got things ready for y'all's "first night." So eat up and go spread some seed. Anyway, eat already! Fine. Wanna have a drink at least? Thank you very much. That's some good drinkin'. Please. What's gotten into you? Father... Let's put an end to this. Please, don't. Hurry up and get changed. You're helping me? Please go to uzume shrine. There's a man there who's sure to help you. Everyone will be guarding the front. Go through the trees there out back. Okay. This won't count for much, but take it for good luck. Thank you. Go on. Mr. devil! Here I am! Boo! Go. Now. But, that girl- hurry up and get out of here! But, why...? I'm sorry, but... I can't. I can't do it anymore. So, you like her? No! But... This is no good. You have to kill them all. I am your only bride. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait up! No! No! No! You're my woman, you know. You're going nowhere! No! No! No! Isuke? Help me. Please! She really ain't been here? We saw a girl running this way, y'know. This is sacred ground. No outsiders may enter. Well, fine. But even if you are the head priest, one false move and who knows what the villagers will do. Still, I mean... you're one of us, right?! It's all right now. Please. It will help warm you up. Thank you. I appreciate it. I believe I warned you... That you should leave this village. I'm sorry... But, what about the others? Are they all right? I have no way of knowing. But... In this village, women are a precious commodity. If they were captured, I'm sure they're still alive. Still... A cloud of madness currently hangs over the village. Let's give thought to what to do next once things have settled down. Until then, I'd like you to please remain here. Okay. Oh, yeah. That girl... There was someone else in that house, a little girl. I'm sure that they've kept her trapped there, and have done terrible things to her. You've seen mitsuha? Indeed, that girl is not of this village... Ten years ago, a family got lost here while out looking for wild edibles... And they were attacked by a bear. But the child escaped, and she survived. That is mitsuha. Women are considered a gift from sarutahikonokami, and so mitsuha was taken in. The thinking was that when she came of age, she would become the son's bride. She was the type who never spoke to anyone, yet she opened up her heart to young takahiro. I often watched them play hide-and-go-seek in the forests surrounding this shrine... And yet, since she arrived in our village, that girl has not aged a single day. It's as if she refuses to become an adult. In truth, that girl is the same age as you. Amano considered her to be cursed, and locked her in his attic. No... "Cursed"? She is indeed cursed. And not just her: This entire village is cursed. Thus, I must save it. That is my calling. What...? You are a virgin, aren't you? What is this...? Don't worry... it's just to help you sleep. God damn it! Where are you? Where are you? Where are you, woman?! What the hell, boy? You'd kill your own father?! M..mom. Everyone... dead. They are? Well done. You're a good boy. Reckon you must be tired. You can have a rest now. The village done got quiet. La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... A sacrifice is needed to quell the curse of sarutahiko, or this calamity shall never end. There's no need to be concerned; You can be offered up to sarutahiko in uzume's stead. You shall be freed from this unclean world to ascend to heaven and live with the gods for eternity. Why... why me? Because it must be a pure girl... One who has remained unsullied. I've waited so long for you. This must truly be divine intervention. I must hurry... a calamity is coming! If I don't act soon, this village will burn to the ground. In the name of amaterasu omikami, she who resides in the heavens within her rocky cavern, today, amongst these endless calamities, I present this pure maiden to her divinity divine uzume not as a vessel but as an offering! No... no, stop! O dread lord sarutahiko, may the gift of this pure maiden appease your fearsome vengeance! What do you find amusing, mitsuha? Well, I mean, it's too late. Everyone's already dead. What? Also, sarutahiko says he doesn't need some woman like that. He has me. Because, I'm uzume. Right, sarutahiko? Who are you?! That's sarutahiko. You would dare defile a sacred ceremony?! You shouldn't do that to a god, you know. It's time for hide-and-go-seek. And sarutahiko is "it." He's really scary, you know. He's already killed all your friends. What are you talking about? Hurry up and run. One... Two... three... four... Five... six... seven... Eight... nine... ten. Vzume-no-mikdtd Takahiko? It's you, isn't it? So you... you killed everyone? But you're so kind. You helped me. Come on... answer me! Answer me! No, you're wrong... you're wrong! It wasn't me! Y what? What's "wrong" about it?! Stay back. Stay back! It was you, wasn't it? You did this, didn't you?! Stay back! Stay back! It was you! Stay back! La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la, la, la... How pretty.
