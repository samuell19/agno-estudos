Let go! Really, you can trust me. I won't say anything. God, let me go! Gabe? Hey, Dad. Just getting home? What gave it away? Don't let your mom see you. We'll talk in the morning. What? Oh, coffee's coffee. I don't know how you drink that. Goes with my fancy lifestyle. Mmm. You still messing with that whatchamajig? The doctor on call asked me to help him out. He's super busy right now. Honey, you are way too smart for this job. Tell me why you didn't study medicine. I had a lot going on. - How is she? - Not good. Ever since Vince left, she's been out of control. Hopefully after her arrest last month, she'd have learned a lesson. You ever thought about a change? Change could be nice. A fresh start for both of you could be good. I wouldn't know where to begin. Oakwood. Oakwood? Yes, the suburbs. I have a friend who works for a doctor there. She's getting ready to go on maternity leave, and they've been looking for somebody to replace her. I could call and see if it's still available. I'm calling on our lunch break. This is Diana. Is she all right? Okay, I'll be right there. Lacey? Go, go, go, go. I'll cover for you. And I'll make that phone call too. Thank you. You are an angel in disguise. Excuse me. Hey, look. Here comes the cavalry. Hold this. Here's the deal. She's gonna be all right, but I would monitor her. She's pretty drunk right now, so it's hard to tell if she has a concussion. She fell down the stairs. Oh, I see. Be thankful, It could've been much worse. It's gonna be okay. Thank you. Let me see. Get up. We need to talk. I said get up. I've had enough. Your behavior has been out of control. - You're grounded. - Mom, come on! You're being ridiculous! I'm being ridiculous? You're the one who skipped school to go to a party and get wasted! Excuse me? I said why can't you just be cool like Dad? - He would've been okay with it. - You're right because you're acting just like him. You are on probation. Do you wanna go to jail? You are so lucky that you were born here. You have options. You had options too. I miss him. It's like I go to school, and there's nothing to come home to. Nothing? You know what I mean. Like... I just don't understand why he doesn't return my calls or ever visit me. Oh, honey. He's sick. He's an addict, and he just won't get help. Hey, I talked to a doctor today in Oakwood, and he offered me a job. What? No, you're kidding. You told him no. Well, I was gonna say no, but then the next thing I was doing, I was saying, "When do I start?" Mom, it's my senior year! Honey, you don't understand, but this is for you. No, I'm not moving to some stupid town out in the sticks. Honey, it's a very nice suburb. It's one of the best. No, I'm not moving. I have a life and friends here. Well, you're gonna meet really nice friends there, not like the ones you have here, who laugh at you when you almost kill yourself. Oh, my God. You're unbelievable. Thank you for ruining my life. You see this? It's the coroner's report. Becca Thomas, 19, found near Lake Underwood, DOA. Initial death is listed as a drug overdose, but the coroner's report lists inconsistent bruising, suggesting a struggle. Possible homicide. You want me to check on it? No, I can handle it. Where's she from? Oakwood. Oakwood was named one of the top 10 towns in America. Why don't you give it a chance, honey? Don't have much of a choice, do I? Come on. Fine. I'll give it a chance. You'll see. Hi. - Diana? - Yes. Oh, welcome. I'm Amy. Dr. Rivera? Thank you so much for coming in today. As I mentioned on the phone, I have to come in late tomorrow, so I just wanted to give you the rundown on how to open up. Great. I'm so ready to have this baby. Oh, I bet. Do you know what you're having? - It's a girl. - Aww. Did you give her a name? I'm not sure yet. I'm thinking "Lily." Baby talk, baby talk. Amy, what did we talk about before? Sorry, I forgot. No baby talk during office hours. I'm Dr. Rivera. You must be Diana? I am. Oh, man, am I glad that you reached out to us. Just in time. As you can see, we're in a bind. Thank you so much for having me. Just to be certain, you're not pregnant, are you? No, I'm not. Good. I don't like surprises. We weren't done talking, Dr. Rivera. Hello. Hi. I'm Diana. Sheriff Tucker. First time here? It is. It's a beautiful place. Can be. Well, now that Diana's met everyone, I'm gonna give her the rundown on how everything works. Well, let me not keep you. I'll be with Sheriff Tucker. - Great. - Okay, come this way. So you're liking your new school? I guess. This track is so nice. Yeah. The outer lane was measured wrong. It's three and a half inches tighter than the others, so it could shave a couple seconds off your 400. Didn't know you ran the 400 too. Once a week, right before I throw up on poor Lisa here. That was so gross. Where'd you go before this? I went to school in the city. Oh. It's pretty different to here then. Yeah, the students are a lot different, like the way they dress, the way they talk. Yeah. Ready. That's Gabe. He's the doctor's son. You should probably stay away from him. Excuse me, you can't go there. You're the new girl, I'm guessing. Yes, I am, and you are? I see you've met my wife Susan. Oh, God, I am so sorry. I had no idea that he was... Married? Yeah. He forgets sometimes too. I need to speak to you privately. Now? This can't wait till I get home? I'm sorry, this is important. Sheriff Tucker's back again. What does he want? This really couldn't wait until I got home? You can leave early, Diana, I'll see you in the morning. Okay, sure. - Hey, Mom. - You're late. Where were you? I had track practice. I thought that ended two hours ago. I went to Emma's afterwards. Hey, I'm making dinner. I don't want you hanging out with people I don't know. She's on my track team. I understand that, but I'd like to meet them first. Mom, I'm 18. Can you just chill? Did you forget what happened in the city? No! How could I when you're constantly reminding me? Jeez! Don't look now, but Gabe is staring over here. He can stare anywhere he wants. Oh, boy, here he comes. Hey, rumor has it you're the new girl. Rumors are true. I'm Gabe. So I've heard. You have? Well, heard you're in a band. We're headed over to Zack's to practice. Wanna come? I have track. What about later? Come on. I promise we're not that bad. You ready to go, Gabe? Yo, I gotta go meet my boy. Yeah, coming. Whatever. Dr. Rivera's office. Dr. Rivera's office. Hold on. Yes. I will let Dr. Rivera know. Excuse me? Uh-huh. I'll call you back. That was the sixth call today from someone wanting pain medication refill. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine? That's crazy. I didn't realize you had a medical degree, Diana. I don't. Oh. Then you should let the medical professional diagnose what his patients need and keep your thoughts to yourself. Do you have an appointment? I don't, but I need to see Dr. Rivera. Well, his schedule's really full, but I can make an appointment... - Look, I need to see him! - I'm sorry. Can you just fit me in the books or something? I need to talk to him! What do you not understand? Hold on, honey. Just let me explain this to you. His schedule is full, but I can make an appointment for you for another week. I need to see Dr. Rivera now! Tori, what's wrong? Are you okay? No! Who hired her? It's okay. I'll take her. She okay? Nobody in this town is okay. Dr. Rivera's office. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So why don't you tell me what happened? I saw her walking on the side of the road. I didn't think she was just gonna jump in front of my car. Jump? She must have seen me. And you didn't swerve to avoid her? I couldn't. It all happened so fast. I... Uh-huh. We have to run a blood test on you, make sure you're not on anything. Are you serious? You think I'm on something? Hey, hey, I'm just doing my job, covering my bases. Fine, but I think you should do blood work on Tori too. And why's that? She seemed off. Her behavior before the accident was... strange. All right. I'll run a blood test on her, make sure she doesn't have any drugs or alcohol in her system. Do you think she's gonna be all right? You can ask her yourself. She's two beds down. And, uh, I don't want you leaving town till we get this mess sorted out, okay? Ow. Diana. You shouldn't be here. I'm sorry. Is she going to be okay? I'll know more once I get her test results and she wakes up. Hey, hey. I'm so worried about her. I keep thinking what if it was Lacey. Accidents happen. Look, Tori has some emotional issues, and that may have contributed to her behavior. I don't think you have anything to worry about with Lacey. You don't know. Before we moved here, Lacey was in a bad place. Between the divorce, my job, and my husband's addictions, Lacey got lost. She started hanging out with a bad crowd, coming home late, drunk. And now? She seems better. But who knows? Kids can be great liars. If you'd like, I could talk to her. I've helped a lot of kids in this town. Maybe I could help Lacey. I just wanted wanted to fix everything, and now this. We'll know more tomorrow. Your car insurance is up to date, isn't it? Yes, why? I wanna make sure her medical bills are gonna be covered. With everything that's happened, I don't want you to worry about Tori's medical bills too. Listen, I gotta take this. You've had a long day. Take some time to absorb everything. Lacey? Lacey? You going somewhere? Yeah. A few friends invited me to watch their band practice. Mom? This is the part where you ask me who I'm hanging out with. I was in an accident. What? When? She walked right in front of my car. My God, is she okay? She was taken to the hospital. I just came from there. Oh, Mom. I can just stay here with you. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, no. It's okay. You go ahead. And besides, we... we agreed that we're gonna trust each other, right? Yeah, but I... No, no. It's okay. You go have fun. I'll be okay. Just be smart. It's Emma. She's here. Go. Go have fun. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Yes, go. Okay. I love you. Love you. - You came. - I did. Oh, this is my friend Emma. Hey, I think I remember you from school. Yeah, we have U.S. History together. Okay, why don't you guys come sit down? You want something to drink? Of course they do. Who wants a fuzzy naval? What's in a fuzzy naval? Stop being such a nerd and try it. You'll like it. Hey, guys, sorry to do this, but I think I have to go home. But we just got here. I'm sorry, but I guess my mom got called into work, so I have to go watch my little sister. Stay. I'll give you a ride home. Do you mind? Of course not. I'll just see you Monday. Hey, Gabe, are you playing the song you wrote about me? Actually... I'm writing a new song about Lacey. You want one? What is it? What isn't it? Hi, Diana, it's Barbara. Hey, check out the article I sent you on Becca Thomas. She was from Oakwood. It's so very sad. I was debating whether or not to send it to you. Don't wanna freak you out. "The body of Rebecca Thomas, 20, was found near Lake Underwood. Thomas was reported missing on July 19th by family. The cause of death is still under investigation. Prior to working at Brews & Blues, Rebecca Thomas was a secretary... for Dr. James Rivera"? This is wild. I can't believe our parents work together. Should I be worried? Maybe a little. I'm kidding, okay? Hey, do you mind if we stop by my house for a quick second? No, that's fine. You sure you don't want anything else? Actually, can I ask you about somebody I just read about? Becca Thomas. Told her he was trouble. Of course, she wouldn't listen to me, not at all. Actually thought he loved her. Can you believe that? Wouldn't surprise me if he had something to do with it. Who? Dr. Rivera, of course. And who's that? Well, you should know. You work for him. How do you know that? Everyone knows that. Where's Mom? She's in her room. Who's your friend? I'm Lacey. You're Diana's daughter. I'll be right back. So how do you like Oakwood? It's a nice town. I like it okay, I guess. You're in pretty good shape. You play any sports? Yeah, I run track. Nice. It keeps you in shape for sure. - Let's go. - It was nice meeting you. Pleasure was all mine. Great. Come out of the car. Hands where I can see them. Walk backwards. You got something for me? Who's the girl? Just a friend from school. Hmm. What's the problem? You're not known for your assessments, kid. Stop worrying, old man. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's cool. It was just a misunderstanding. It's really late. I know. Breath. I thought you trusted me. I trust you. Breath. See? No alcohol. Come home late again, and you're grounded. Love you, Mom. Is he here? Who? Dr. Rivera. Hey! Hello? Hello! Hey! Are you Diana? Yeah. I'm Gabe, James's son. I need to get something from his office. Yeah, sure, just go ahead. Yes, will you please hold on? Did you get what you wanted? How's Lacey? She's fine. Why? No reason. Just being polite. My dad likes you. Says you're very thorough. Says you're not here to just answer calls. You gonna get that? Dr. Rivera's office. Hold on. Okay. Wouldn't surprise me if he had something to do with it. Actually thought he loved her. Can you believe that? Sheriff Tucker. What are you doing in here? I was just dropping off Dr. Rivera's mail. He keeps his door locked. Oh, Gabe stopped by. I guess he has the key. I was just closing the door. Hmm. Gabe stopped by. Mm-hmm. All right. Oh, I wanna tell you, Tori was released today. She's back home. Oh, that's great news. It is. She retained a lawyer in regards to the accident. Thought you should know. Hi. These are for you. Thanks. How are you? Fine. Are your parents home? No, my parents have been home in quite a long time. - Oh. - Is there something else? I probably shouldn't really be talking to you. Tori, why were you seeing Dr. Rivera? Excuse me? Did they make you jump in front of my car? Uh, that's none of your business. Well, it is, if you're planning on suing me. I never said I was gonna sue you. Get lost, lady. Here. Take one of these. It'll help you relax. Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Come on, don't you want Gabe to like you? He likes girls that use? He likes girls that are fun. Why do you think he hasn't kissed you yet? Attagirl. Come on. Let's go have some fun. Well, hello there, Diana. I hope you're staying out of trouble. I'll see you later, baby. Diana. How's the baby? She's great, thank you. How's Dr. Rivera and the witch? I'm sorry? His wife. She acts all high and mighty, and he's here sleeping with all the women in the town. I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have said that. Let me take you home. Come on. I really think I should take you home. Okay, you're gonna be okay. Hold on. Say hello to your mother for me, all right? - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, my God. Okay. - Okay, all right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you so much. Hi, can I talk to the detective who's handling Becca Thomas's case? Yes, I can hold. Yes? I'll leave a message. Detective Barnes, this is Diana Adams. You can reach me at this number. I have information on a particular individual. I think he might be connected to that girl that was murdered in Oakwood. Thank you. Thank you for coming, Detective Barnes. What else can you tell me about Becca? Ms. Adams, this is a murder investigation. If you have any vital information, you're required by law to share it with me. I started to work for Dr. Rivera recently. I came across Becca Thomas's file, and I noticed that he was prescribing her a lot of pain medications. I also found a sonogram for Rebecca Thomas in Dr. Rivera's office. Yes. She was pregnant. Yes, but I think the baby was his. Becca's coworker, she told me Becca was sleeping with Dr. Rivera. What if he didn't want the baby? That might've given him a reason to kill her. Have you told anyone what you suspect? Okay, good. If Dr. Rivera is involved in any way in Becca's murder, we don't wanna give him the opportunity to cover his tracks. Now, do you think you can give me that file? Yes, I do. Is it Dr. Rivera? We don't know yet. We think there may be a larger network involved in illicit drug sales in this area. We were already investigating Dr. Rivera. That complicates the murder investigation. Oh, God. God, I'm scared now. I can't afford to move. What if he is involved? What if he knows that I'm on to him? What do you think he's gonna do, hmm? Ms. Adams... if he says anything or does anything that scares you or even makes you nervous, you contact me immediately. Here's my card. I'll call you in a few days, we'll meet up, you can give me her file, then I'll record your statement. Diana... everything is gonna be fine. Dr. Rivera's office. Oh, hi. This is Alex from Grant Pharmacy. Nora Owens is waiting here on her prescription refill. Dr. Rivera was supposed to call it in a few hours ago. Can you check on this for me? Yes, sure. Let me call you back in a couple minutes, okay? - Okay, thanks. - All right, bye-bye. No, you listen to me. I promise you, I will kill her first! Diana! Are you looking for something? Grant Pharmacy called. Nora Owens is waiting for her prescription. I was just looking for a chart. Why didn't Nora use Rivera Pharmacy? I don't know. Was she supposed to? I must have missed it. - Are you all right? - I am. You look a little nervous. Did you get your blood work results from Sheriff Tucker yet? No, but I wasn't on anything. Hmm. What are you trying to say? That I understand what you're going through. If I almost killed someone, I'd be a little bit unstable. I'll call Grant Pharmacy. Oh, and I'll call Sheriff Tucker for you too. Must be awful having it hanging over you. Hey, what's up? Kara, are you okay? Yeah, I feel great. Can I come inside? Yeah, come in. Cool, cool, cool, cool. - Okay, sit down. - Damn shoes. Hang on. - No, stay sitting. - I don't like those shoes. Ooh, where'd you get that? Um, that is very old. Put that... - It's actually not bad. - You should take that off. That's yours. I don't know why you're setting it on the table. - You look fine. - It's really not my color. - Okay, thank you. - I really like your hair. Oh, no, no, no. Those are expensive. Let's not. Careful, you're gonna fall down. I'm gonna fall. Trust fall. Oh, no, no, no. Kara, Kara... We're best friends already. Isn't that funny? - Sit. - I think you're stuck on me. Sit. Okay, Kara, I'm gonna call Gabe. Yes, you should call Gabe and tell him to bring some beer. I wanna have fun. Can you come over here? No, no, it's Kara. She's completely out of it. Is that Gabe? Oh, my gosh! Hey, Gabe, get your butt over here! We're having a party. Please, please hurry. Hurry. Kara, you really should not be taking any more of those. Kara. Where is she? - Oh, my God, what's happening? - She's OD'ing. Well, what do we do, Gabe? Gabe, what do we do? Whoa, what are those? What are those? I'm giving her Naxalone, okay? It stops her from OD'ing. Sometimes they get mad though. It ruins their buzz. Why do you just have that in your backpack? Because I'm a drug dealer. Let's get out of here. I can drive her to the hospital. Gabe? Yeah. Is Kara gonna be okay? She'll be fine once she sleeps it off. Thank you. My mom would have killed me if she came home and found her like that. You owe me. Big time. What do you want? There's a party tomorrow night. Come hang out with me. I'll think about it. Here. Have one of these. Take the edge off. Bye. You've gotta be kidding me. Okay, all right. Hey, honey. I got you something. Mom. Aren't you gonna tell me about these? I don't know what you're talking about. They're prescription drugs, Lacey. I found them on your floor. Well, they're not mine. Mom, they're not mine. If they were, I would tell you. So are you trying to tell me that you haven't had any drugs or alcohol since we moved here? And I wanna know what is going on between you and Gabe. He's my friend. Lacey, a girl from this town was murdered. She used to work for Dr. Rivera. I'm worried he had something to do with it, and I'm starting to think that Gabe had something to do with it too. Wait, why would you think that? Did he give you these drugs? No! Mom, you're being ridiculous. Well, I don't want you seeing him anymore. What? No, Mom, we have plans. We're going to Zack's tomorrow. No you're not. You're staying home. I'm gonna pack you, and you're gonna move to my mother's. Okay, wait, so first you want me to move to this stupid town, and then you want me to start at this stupid school, and now you want me to move to your mother's? Well, I made a mistake, okay? I'm sorry. This town is just not safe. Yes, Mom, she's gonna stay with you this week, then I don't know. It's an emergency, okay? Thank you. Lacey? I need to speak to you. Come down. Lacey. Thanks for helping me with Kara the other day. No problem. How is she? Probably getting high again. Oh, you're kidding. No. She's wandering around here somewhere. - This is too much. - What is? Everything. Kara. Me. All of this. You don't need to take pills. What about you? It's mostly for show. My dad's an addict. He was wasted all the time, and he just treated my mom so terribly. I hated it. Then one day he just took off. I haven't seen him since. I was so mad at him. I just wanted a normal family, you know? You and me both. Then I realized I was just mad for all the wrong reasons. I don't wanna be like him. I don't wanna see you anymore. Gabe? What is it, Kara? Can we talk? Talk. Alone, please. I'll be right back. What do you want? Got a letter from the state. It says... "We noticed that Rivera Pharmacy has been distributing an exorbitant amount of opioids, over 30 times the average amount." They wanna see your records. So? So... I'm worried, James. They're gonna see that you're the prescribing doctor in almost everything. I could lose my license. We live in a small town, and I'm one of the only doctors around. It's only natural that I would be prescribing medications to the majority of people patronizing your pharmacy. You need to take this more seriously. These are federal crimes, you idiot! Do you want to ruin Oakwood's ranking? It's just a letter, that's all. It's not an investigation. It's just a letter. God. You're always so tense. Want me to prescribe something for you? How can you be so calm? I have to go to the office. Now? Why? Patient emergency. Oh, yeah? Who's the patient? Look, I can't help you, Kara. Can you call your dad? No! You're a mess. Please, Gabe. Look, I need them. I'll do whatever you want. No. Lacey, please call me back. Where are you? "Diana, it's Detective Barnes. Did you get me Rebecca's file?" Dr. Rivera? Dr. Rivera? Dr. Rivera? Dr. Rivera? Hello? Oh, my God! Hello? I need an ambulance. 2200 Main Street. There's been a stabbing. Okay, please hurry! Okay, they're coming. Okay, slowly. Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Just hold onto me. It's gonna be okay. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Okay, okay. Look at me. Just focus here, Dr. Rivera. Please, please, please don't die. Okay, please stay with me. Gabe. - What? - Gabe. Gabe? Oh, my God. - Mom! - Lacey? Lacey, where are you? - Mom, what... - Lacey? Mom. Lock the door. I'll be right there, okay? Mom, I can't... Mom, I'm losing you. - I'll be right there, okay? - Mom, I can't... Lacey! Hey, Lacey, open the door. Gabe, no! I don't have time for you right now, Gabe. - It's me, okay? - Gabe, no, go away! You have to help me, okay, Lacey? Come on, just talk to me, okay? I'll explain everything, Just please open the door, okay? Lacey, I need you, okay? Open the door. Please, hey, come on. Please just open the door. - What do you want? - You. I just want you. - No, don't. - Lacey, I... I love you, okay? And I'm scared, and I don't know what to do anymore. Everything is just so messed up. Thank you, Lacey. Is your mom home? Diana, is everything okay? No. I need you to meet me at Dr. Rivera's office. Why? What's going on? Dr. Rivera is... He's dead. He's dead. And I think his son had something to do with it. Diana, I need you to calm down. Don't do anything until I get there, understand? Okay. Hello? Hello? Who's there? Diana! Diana! Sheriff Tucker, you scared me. I'm gonna need you to come down. Come on. Come on, come here. Come here. Give me your hand. What are you doing? What... What are you doing? Why don't you tell me what happened? Dr. Rivera is dead. I'm well aware of that. You know, it's funny because... the murder happens off camera. Almost like the killer knew where to do it. What are you trying to say? Someone who was intimately familiar with the office, perhaps. Someone who was dispersing opioids to the entire town, perhaps? That wouldn't be you now, would it, Diana? No. Check this out. It's your blood test after the accident. Came back positive. Looks like Dr. Rivera's secretary was sneaking some drugs on the side. No wonder you hit that poor little girl. Mm-mm-mm. You're not gonna get away with this. Mm-mm. If you like opioids, you're gonna love this. Shh... Dr. Rivera has been practicing for 10 years. And you show up, and a month later, he gets his throat cut. It is not looking good for you, darling. What are you doing to me? I have a daughter. And she is a cutie pie. I wouldn't worry. I'm sure Gabe's taking very, very good care of her. You're sick. Mm-mm. Why are you doing this to me? I'm looking out for the interests of Oakwood. ...the interests of Oakwood. We have a reputation to uphold. ...a reputation to uphold. Barnes, what do you want? I called him. He drugged me. Fentanyl, I think. Oh, Diana. Diana. Diana. I'm really sorry you got involved, Diana. Is he dead? Hmm. He is now. No more sloppy police work for my boy here. Sounds like you took care of your husband. I did, and Diana here showed up right on the dot. I barely had time to get out. - Why are you doing this to me? - Is he dead? You have everything to pin this on her? Yep, everything's there. It implicates her and her daughter's prior addictions. Fingerprints are all over the crime scene. Susan, Susan, you don't have to do this. I wish I didn't have to, honey. But there's too many questions. Questions our town doesn't need. Oakwood has to remain one of the top 10 suburbs in the country. Don't you understand how important that is? I've gotta get back to the office before they miss me. You sure you have everything covered? Yep, I'm positive. Okay. She shot the sheriff with this gun. Damn junkies. You choose, honey. You can go the easy way or the hard way. If I were you, I'd choose the easy way. Peaceful drifting away into a quiet slumber. Same way as that slut, Becca Thomas. How dare she get pregnant with my husband. Lacey. Gabe's mother is trying to kill me. I'm behind the doctor's office. Why couldn't you just do this the easy way? Please. Don't do this. You don't have to do this. I wish I didn't have to, but it's too late. Mom! They're over there! Wait, please don't. Please don't. Shoot up. You or Lacey. Mom! Mom, she's over here! All right, Gabe, time to step up to the big leagues. Shoot your girlfriend there. Mom? What have you done? I did what I had to do to protect our family. That's enough, Mom. This is over. Gabe! Lacey. Mom! Mom! I love you, Lacey. I love you, Mom. Hey. How was your session? It was good. We talked about Dad and Gabe. I'm really sorry about everything I've put you through in the past year. Oh, don't be. Look, no matter what happens, I will always be there for you. I just don't wanna interfere anymore. This is your life, Lacey. I just want you to be happy. I love you. I love you too, Mom. I have a surprise for you. Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad. So where do we start?
