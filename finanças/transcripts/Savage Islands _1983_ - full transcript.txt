Go on. RATBAG: Can't we leave the stuff here? No, let's get across. (CLEARS THROAT) It's unhealthy to worry. Captain, I'd feel healthier on this side. Just think about the gold. (DOG BARKING) Captain Hayes, you have guns? I got guns. You got gold? I see guns, you see gold. Guns first, huh? Yeah. All right, boys, open them up! The Spanish have? US Army, madam. The Spaniards do not have. (GUN FIRES) (NATIVES GASPING) (LAUGHING) How about that? (GUN COCKING) BLAKE: Hey, watch out! Duck, lads.

I don't think this woman's honest, Blake. Yeah, the heathens have been exposed to Western business practices. They used to be honest. Yeah, times are changing, sir. Show me more guns, now! Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. See what happens with women and business. Future looks dark, Blake. I couldn't agree more, sir. There are your guns! Here are your bullets.

(WOMAN SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) (SHOUTING) (NATIVES SHOUTING) Goodbye, ladies! No hard feelings, I hope. (LAUGHING) (GUN COCKING) (SIGHING) By order of His Majesty, the King of Spain, I hereby charge you with supplying arms to the enemies of the Crown. So tell me, Bully, how have you been? Not bad, Ben. How long you been working for the Spaniards? Ever since they could meet my price. How long have you been selling guns to the natives? Just started, Ben. What a pity it's gotta end so soon. Shame. I been waiting a long time to see you fall, Bully. It's gonna be a grand sight, watching your neck stretched all to hell at the end of a Spanish rope. You sound like a very sad and bitter old lady, Ben. (LAUGHING) And so the so-called "Pirate Era" is coming to an end, with the arrival of the new steam-powered naval vessel. Very good. Very, very good. Their arrival, your departure. The end of an age. Are you writing down in that book that I'm a pirate? Well, in a manner of speaking, I suppose one could say that I am, yes. Good, 'cause I am, and a damn good one, too. No, I never flew the skull and crossed bones. That's for your fictioneers. But I have sought pleasure and profit all of my life at sea, with no regard for any man's law. That's not to say without morals and standards. I got morals and standards. I never killed anybody that didn't have it coming. I never cheated an honest man. I never pillaged, and I never raped. I applaud you. Were you ever married? Well, I suppose a man's ship becomes his wife and mistress. Or so I've been told. It's hard to love a ship. What? They rot. Oh, yes, of course they do. But memories, Lord God, I've got memories! I can't regret dying today. Hell, I lived more than any man deserves. Yes, yes, indeed. Mr. Hayes... Bully. Sorry? Call me, Bully. Thank you, Bully. Hmm. Mr... Bully, well, one question I was meaning to ask you is how you ended up here? The Rona, I suppose, is what put my neck in the noose today. The Rona? Yes. She was a damn good ship. Nothing to be proud of, you understand, just an old bucket, but she did her job without complaint. We'd been two months hauling this young couple across the Pacific Ocean in time for their wedding on some mission island. He planned to live there and convert the heathens, which to me seemed a hell of a waste of her. She was the finest thing I ever saw. Another one of Fong's fine meals gone to the fish, Mr. Williamson. Captain, won't you tell him to try Ratbag's cure? There is no cure. You don't have much misery left. We'll sight land tomorrow morning. Then you must try it now, Nathaniel! At least enjoy the last few hours at sea. I regret that this is something I can never enjoy. Oh, but you could! It's wonderful, isn't it, Captain? You just don't realize it, because you're so miserable. Now off you go and see Ratbag. Captain Hayes will look after me, won't you, Captain? Excuse me. Your husband will recover soon enough when he sets foot on solid ground, ma'am. He's not my husband. Not yet. Do you know the missionary life? Can't say that I do, ma'am. But you know the mission stations? The missionaries? Yes, most of them. Then you know what it's like. It's quiet. Can you see me as a missionary? Let's say I wouldn't want to see you as a missionary. Oops! Do you come for the cure? We'll fix you up all right, Reverend. You're confident that you can cure me? Captain Hayes. Yes? I recently lost my father. I'm sorry. Thank you. He left me a small inheritance. I've never really known what to do with the money. Nathaniel knows very little about money matters. I should like very much to invest in your trading company. I--I couldn't take your money, ma'am. Couldn't I become a stockholder? I couldn't guarantee your investment. Ships go down. Cargoes get lost. It's a risky business. But isn't that the nature of an investment? Putting something at risk in--in order to gain a substantial return? (WHISPERING) Yes, ma'am. Here's to a long and fruitful partnership. I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention anything to Nathaniel. I can't guarantee he'd be as trusting as I am. It's our secret, ma'am. (SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (ALL SHOUTING) Nathaniel! (ALL CHEERING) Big man God! Big man God! Mama Jesus Christ! Moaka, what is the matter? Boat! Much boat! Moaka, please do not refer to the Reverend and I as "Big Man God" and "Mama Jesus Christ." You're putting your soul in jeopardy. Much white man. Amen man. It's Nathaniel! You're not telling us a fib, are you? Much boat! (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) It is Nathaniel! Edgar, go and get my parasol and put on your coat. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) This is our farewell then, miss. But not for long, I hope. You'll be back to see us, won't you, Captain? You may rely on that. Take care of my investment. As if it were my own, ma'am. NATHANIEL: Go easy with that desk! It's fragile! All the way from Boston to be damaged at the last moment. Thank you. Your men are better suited to the handling of sacks of coal than fine furniture, Captain. BULLY: Your desk ain't hurt. Anyway, we delivered you safely, didn't we, Reverend? I am not a reverend. Not yet. Closer to a reverend than we've had on this ship. I would like to say it had been a pleasant voyage, however... However, Miss Sophie enjoyed it. You have a very fine woman there. Yes, I had noticed how much you enjoyed her company. You need not tell me of her qualities, nor indeed how fortunate I am in having won her hand. Farewell, Captain. I hope you can hold on to her. I wouldn't let it worry you. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Slipped, God's truth. Nathaniel, what happened? Nothing, just a little slip. Welcome to paradise. Shall we? Nathaniel! Oh, Nathaniel! Aunt Katherine. Oh! Uncle. Good to see you, my boy. And this is my Sophie. Sophie? My uncle. My aunt. The Reverend and Mrs. Williamson. Hello. How do you do, Sophie? We've heard so much about you in Nathaniel's letters, haven't we, dear? MRS. WILLIAMSON: Yes, we have. Welcome. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) You look as though you might've left something behind. Don't be an idiot, Blake. And what does one do when one is not converting islanders? We teach the word of God. Do they speak English? (CHUCKLES) Not at all. The word of God transcends language. So I've heard. Nathaniel, what's the matter? My watch. Those thieves stole my watch when I took that stupid cure. REVEREND: Who were these people, Nathaniel? Who did you travel with? An absolute rogue... A charming man, called... Bully Hayes. Bully Hayes! May the Lord be praised you're here in safety. Bully Hayes is a cutthroat and a brigand. He and men like him are what's turning the Pacific from a paradise into a-an abomination. The man's a vile blackbirder! Blackbirder? A slaver. Trafficker in human misery. Oh, yes, you are most fortunate to have lost only your watch. Most fortunate indeed. (MOSQUITOES BUZZING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (HEN CLUCKING) Mr. Blake! Sir? Get this tub about! To go where, sir?

Is there somewhere we can hold a discussion? BEN: Yeah. Come this way, Captain. Count. Whatever. (MAN GROANING) Mr. Pease, the slave trade has been abolished in every civilized land. Oh, them ain't slaves, Captain. Contract laborers, and I've got the contract somewhere. I'll show them to you sometime. I hope so. What's up, Captain? Don't you trust your business partner? My country is interested to make much bigger the scope of its global influence. Specifically in this region. Yeah, it's nice around here, isn't it? We wish to establish coaling stations for our ships. The new "thunder-barges," eh? Steam-powered warships, Mr. Pease. And good anchorage, like Ponape, is what empires are built around, huh? We intend to sign and honor a treaty. King Oatopi of Ponape never signed a treaty with nobody. He's an evil bastard. Practices incest on his own offspring. Eats human flesh. (SLURPING) Sacrifices his enemies. You ever show your pink, little behind around there, he'll have you screwed, tattooed and served up with an apple in your mouth. Mr. Pease, I have the whole of the German Empire at my support. He'll eat them, too. Now the point of the matter is, Captain, you need me. Me and the King are practically brothers. What's your price? Five hundred gold marks. (CHUCKLING) I wouldn't piss for 500 gold marks. What would you... Never mind. You couldn't afford it. But I'll get you your treaty with the King, for 5,000 gold marks. (SOPHIE SCREAMING) Let me go, or I'll kill him! (GASPING) I'm very serious. (GASPS) Now, what'll you offer me, missy? (BEN LAUGHING) Uh-oh. (COUGHS) Hello, hello! Hello, hello! Over here! Rats!

How on earth did he get out here? It's a miracle. Bloody hell! I've robbed the bleeding messiah! Ask him to walk over here to us! If he can't do it, send a boat. (GROANING) BULLY: Welcome aboard, Reverend. The good Lord is with you today. Hayes, Hayes, you murderer! RATBAG: Stop it! No! (GRUNTING) Bloody hell, get him! Bloody hell!

He ain't no blackbirder! Kill him, Captain. Slowly! You should try the whip, Captain. Go on then, do it! You got the wrong man, Reverend. There's no blackbirds and no Sophie aboard this ship. Let him go, boys. (SOBBING) Then where is she? I think you know. I pray to God I do, son. (GASPS) Take him below. There, you'll need those. Thank you. You still think I did it, don't you? What proof do I have that you didn't? Your blackbird sign is all over that island. You're well known as a liar, a cheat, a swindler. Don't forget bigamous and barrater and buccaneer, extortionist, trickster, bamboozler, music-hall entertainer and master mariner. And blackbirder. The man who raided your island was Ben Pease. Who? Captain Ben Pease. (SIGHING) A long time ago, Ben and I were business partners. We had a falling-out over a certain young lady. I shot his balls off. It was an accident. Now he blames me for everything he does. Every time he loots or pillages or murders, he leaves my sign behind. I'll tell you, boy, that the sorry bastard will do anything. Then why haven't you done anything about it before? I don't know. I've gotten used to it, I guess. Used to it? Or grown to like it? Like it? The notoriety. Reputation can have its profits. I know that. (LAUGHING) Yeah, surely. But the cost has gone too high. Then you are going to do something about it? I intend to. And what of my Sophie? She's not your Sophie today, boy. And we'll find her. Before Pease kills her? He won't kill her. He may slap her around a little bit, but he won't hurt her. Then there has to be an end to Ben Pease. I'd appreciate it if you'd help me kill him. I'd be happy to, son. We'll send him straight to hell where he belongs. Good morning, Reverend. How are you? Better than I was. Good. Where are we? Coming into the port of Samoa. It's not the jewel of the Pacific, but it is the center. Center for what? Everything. Every kind of thieving, profiteering criminal in the world passes through here sooner or later. What the civilized world won't have finds a happy home in Samoa. Including Ben Pease? That's his brig, the Leanora, right there. Well, then, shouldn't we go over there and seize him and his ship right now? If you want Ben, you don't knock on his front door. He wouldn't answer?
