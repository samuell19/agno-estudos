Mr Murthy, welcome. My daughter's wedding is fixed on 10th day of the next month. Good! You should attend along with your family. Not just my family, the entire supermarket gang would attend. Well... What's your daughter doing? She is working as software engineer. It's a happy thing, isn't it? Find a software engineer guy and get her married. So soon? She is still a kid. She's still munching on 5-star chocolates, and didn't start drinking breezer yet. Does that mean that you wouldn't you get her married? Of course, I would get her married. But let her enjoy her job for some time. It's better you get her married before she brings a guy and says, "Dad, he's my boyfriend and your son-in-law to be." Even if it is her selection or ours, both of them should have a prosperous long life and that is what we wish for. -I'll surely attend the wedding, Mr Murthy-See you, Mr Rao.

Who are you gifting to? -To Madhulatha. Today is her birthday. -Oh, good! Someone has been asking for oil packets since a while and you can't hear that. But you can clearly see this kind of things.

I don't see even one percent of interest to work. Do you think it's some sort of almshouse to come and leave whenever you want? I'll fire you if you come late next time. Get to your work. [dials] Hello. Even this isn't working. Damn! -Hey, Deva -Huh What are you doing inside? What's the delay in changing your dress? Anyhow, any dress would look same on your stupid body! Come fast! What are you doing, huh? Do it properly! But no one turns up to see what customer needs. Hey Arjun, we saw Sanjana! Hey, stop dreaming and propose her. Hey, Muhurta is not needed to express love. How much time will you sit here staring at her? Go and express your love! Let's cut the cake if she accepts your love. If she rejects, let's booze on beers! [laughs] Umm... Hmm... -Hey -Yes. Some guy over there is staring here like an owl! [scoffs] Take it easy! Hey douche bag, what are you staring at? Kill you! They're worthless idiots. We should be careful with these people. Hmm... Hey... Hey kid... Hey, poet... What are you writing? Okay. Let's go. I'm writing about my love like a poem. Poetry in Whatapp generation? Girls of this generation even stopped naming them Kavita(poem) How do you expect girls to fall for your poem? They'd take this tissue paper and throw it in the bin by wiping their mouths. The black forest icecream would be even better. What's your problem, guys? Is Malli your name? You seem like a chicken seller in the Sunday market. And your face is like the pakoda seller in that very market. Ew! Look, don't waste your time following me. He's in front of you, not behind you. You! Stop your fuss now! -I'm sorry. Come. -Yes, let's go. Hey! What a chick she is, dude! -Who the hell are you? -Hey, chick! Let go of it. Why the hell are you throwing Chunari everywhere you wish? -Hey, let go of her. -Bro, she's setting a bait with Chunari. Is it so? So, I'm the big fish that fell for that bait. You rascal! Hold your words. Bro, she's asking her to hold her tight! Go on. Is it? Then, let me do something. Hey, what's the matter? What is it? Hey, who the hell are you?

You forget something or the other. It's already late, let's go. Okay. Hey, your madness has crossed limits. Why didn't you give her ID card? Because this ID card stays close to Sanjana's heart. This ID card knows every emotion, which her heart expresses every day. Oh God! This isn't normal madness. Ow! Sorry, bro... Sorry... I didn't see. Sorry! Please... -Hi dude... -Hi dude... -Hey, Siddha. -Please dear, I want to see you once. Search the address of this company on Google. Come, dear... Please come quickly, dear. Try to understand, dear.

Hey, he must be somewhere over here. -What's your mobile's Wifi name? -Deepika Padukone. As if you're lacking just her in your life! Freaking idiot! Hey, switch on Wifi on your mobiles and each of you go in a different direction. [mobile blips] [jingle bells clinking] Hey... [groans] Hey, Ravi, Raja, Rakesh... Come on, boys. Finish that guy off! [dials] [phone rings] Arjun, we couldn't connect to that Wifi anywhere. You couldn't connect to Wifi but I've got connected to that rogue's team. Come to my place, guys. Hey... Give me the mobile. Give me the mobile. Hit you... Take this. -Hey! -You are superb, Arjun. Look, the customers made the floor dirty by their muddy feet. Just clean this and leave. Oh no! I'm getting late. See you. Does this vehicle go to Borabanda, bro? [untensils clang] [indistinct cat meows] [indistinct dog barks] [phone ringing] -Hello-It's me, your mom. -How are you doing, son? -I'm doing good. -How about you?-I'm doing good, too. The money lender has been creating scene about payment of interest amount. The payment of your sister's fee is also pending. Mom, give me the phone. I will talk to brother. -Wait, dear -Brother, when are you coming home? Our neighbour Lakshmi's brother brought her new clothes... ...from the city on the ocassion of festival. You too will get me clothes, right? Why aren't you talking anything, brother? Tell me... Hello. Brother, you would get them for me, right? [disconnected dialer tone] Huh? Dialer tone: This facility is not available on your mobile. Kindly contact our customer care executive for complete details. [camera clicks] Ah! Another corpse showed up, sir. It belongs to some girl. It's in a unidentifiable state. Any clues? No, sir. Send the deadbody to autopsy immediately. If there was a missing case of a girl registered in our police station, inform the complainant and ask them to check with this dead body. Okay, sir. Oh! Today's workload is umpteen. We might have to stay late. Yep. Might be. Well... Hey, I'm starving. Shall we go to cafeteria? Yeah, me too. -Okay, let's move. -Okay. Sanju, look over there. Why is he stuck to me like this? [sighs impatiently] Hey... She's coming to us. Why the hell are you smiling? Do you think I'm your girlfriend? [snaps] Hello Why are you smiling as if you're the hero in a soap commercial? Oh, I got it! You want me to fall for your smile. That's what you want, right? I will place you here and take care of you, if you would fall so easily. The days where girls fall for flattery words are over. Update a bit! We have get updated to impress a girl. But to make her fall in love, expressing our love to her is enough. Don't you get my words? How can you even come to my office? I love you. What... What? What is it? Say it again. I love you. You've seen me on the day-before-yesterday. And you've followed me yesterday. And you've proposed me today. [scoffs] Guys like you would come up with break-up tomorrow. Though it is late to fall in love, there shouldn't be any further delay after that. What? There's an old saying that goes 'Nothing can stop a wedding no matter what.' And now, he claims not to delay when you fall in love. Yes. I don't like all these things. Sanju, let's not get into this mess. Let's get out of here. No guy considers going behind a girl as waste of time, after falling in love. He would think he's spending time on his wife to be. So am I. [scoffs] Damn! Bro, you're awesome! -Sanjana... -Huh... Your bag. Damn! Your craze made me fall in love-craze! Love me or hate me but I'll keep loving you. I'll come behind you. I love you. [siren wails] Good morning, sir. Any clues? The dead body belongs to the girl who got recently kidnapped. A sack contains her mobile, clothing and ID card. The phone is locked and we couldn't unlock it. We've sent that to our department, sir. There was office address on her ID card and we've informed her office about her. Look, some guy chased a girl like an animal and threw her body in the public by chopping her into pieces. Forget about respect, the public would disgust us. We should catch him as soon as possible. Sir. Oh! Yuck! Well, make it quick! KRISHNA RAO SUPERMARKET Oops! Hey, watch out and walk. That's the reason one should be attentive to their work. Thank you. Sanju, when he proposed to you, you should have said yes or no and closed that. But why would put a discussion? Should I accept his love upon proposing? Nowadays, girls are not that so easy. What does he know about me? This kind of guys shouldn't be spared. We have to teach them some lesson. Hmm... Enough said. Girls who tell this kind of words would fall in love with them someday. [cicadas critter] I love you. Love me or hate me, but I'll keep loving you. I'll come behind you. I love you. Oh no! How can a guy express his love to a girl without following her? It would be nice to bring a law that states it is no crime to propose to a girl without hurting her. I saw you for the first time when you were helping a kid. Your beauty made me not take my eyes off you I felt your sweet words to that kid as my love lessons. That's it, my heart stopped obeying me. It started to run behind you. You've come across me like a festival and made me feel this to be bond for lives. You've made me walk towards you. I feel I can't live without you. That's why I kept coming to the places wherever you went. Coffee shop, your office, cafeteria etc. I love you, Sanjana. By the way, I didn't tell my name, right? I'm Arjun. My mobile number: 8639568668. I'm waiting for your reply. [chuckles] Sir. The DNA reports have come. The body parts which we found earlier matches the dead body. Arjun, you aren't doing it correctly. Do it properly. What happened to your concentration? Come on... Come on, I say. Enough... Enough... Stop... Stop... I said stop! I said stop the fight. I don't know what has happened to Arjun. He's lacking in concentration. Pretty girl... Who's she? -Sanjana, sir. -Oh! I mean he's our Laddu, sir. Love and girls are the reasons behind guys' distraction and this elder brain can guess that, Arjun. Shall I tell you something? You, who fell an opponent with a single punch in this ring, fell to your opponent's punch today. Is falling in love reason for your fall? Believe me, even your beloved wouldn't be happy to see you lose. Guys, you can fall in love. There is nothing wrong in it. But it shouldn't make you forget your lives and goals. You should have only one goal: The national championship. Keep that in mind. Okay? [door creaks open] [cartoons playing on TV] Hi Sanju. Why didn't Madhu attend office today? Today is her engagement ceremony. She's getting engaged to her cousin. Why didn't she inform anyone? Yeah, it's a sudden plan. It's her granny's last wish and so she's getting engaged. So, granny's death became a benefit to Madhu's wedding. Bye. Oh, it's very late! Security...

But it shouldn't make you forget your lives and goals. Pick up, Arjun... [phone vibrating] You should have only one goal: The national championship. [phone blips] [dials] [phone rings] [serial killer gasps] -Hello... Hello...-[woman weeping] Arjun, this is Sanjana. Sanjana, what happened to you? I'm on the way to home from the office and someone is trying to kill me. I'm unable to understand what to do. [pierces] [groans in pain] [Sanjana groaning] Hello, Sanjana. [serial killer groans] Sanjana, where are you? [pants] Arjun, I can't understand where I am. It's dark everywhere. Don't be scared, Sanjana. I'm coming. Okay, listen carefully. Carefully observe your surroundings and describe them. I can't understand anything. Observe well, Sanjana. You'll find something. I can't see anything, Arjun. He will kill me for sure. Don't be scared, Sanjana. Share your location immediately on Whatsapp. I'm coming. [groans] [vehicle honks] Ow! [groans] Dialer tone: The number you have called is switched off. Damn it! Sanjana... Sanjana... What happened, Sanjana? Sanjana... Nothing will happen to you. Don't be scared, Sanjana... [vehicle arrives] This is not good... I have to find a good groom and get her married. She doesn't want to get married as of now. Let her continue her job for some time. Shut up! You're the reason she became like this. None of this would have happened if she had got married after her studies. What would happen if this gets public? Will she ever get married? I have come to a decision regardless of anyone's opinion. I'll find a groom and get her married. That's all. My decision is irrevocable. Do whatever you want. Did you inform Police? We don't want this to be brought to the police's notice, sir. We'll get her married in a week and send her to America. Please. Alright. It's up to you. What happened, Sanjana? Hi! How come you are here? I would have come to you if you had made a phone call. How are you feeling now? Well... Who is he? Why did he try to kill you? Never mind. Nothing happened to you. What if something happened to me? I would have searched for him and killed him right at that spot. I can't bear if something happens to you. When we are getting drenched in rain during problems, a guy who comes to us asks for the reason for our tears rather than asking reason for getting drenched, is our companion! You considered my problem as yours. Can't I become your love? I love you Arjun. "I never thought..."

I should somehow confess my love today. Hmm. [scoffs] Idiot! -Can't you see? -Madam... Is this how you behave with the customers? What happened, madam? What's this mess? Why do you hire such people? They don't even know how to behave with the customers. Hey! How many times do I need to tell you... ...that you shouldn't come to a place where there are customers? Go inside and arrange the goods accordingly. Why do you trouble us when you are not interested to work? -Go! -Hmm. Idiot! Sorry, madam.

Was it money? I would have given my entire earnings in return! Mr. Rao, please calm down. Stop -He must be the culprit sir! -I'll talk to him, please come My daughter was so innocent How could you even think of harming her so badly? Why would I kill Sanjana, whom I loved more than my life? I don't know who you are boy But they are in the grief of losing their daughter right now You better not stay here. Please leave immediately Please leave [glass breaks] Arjun... Arjun... you should come with me at once So you know about Sanjana's murder Your silence makes me doubt you I didn't kill Sanjana sir Then what's with the bloodened clothes and your attire? She committed suicide right before my eyes Suicide? She has a habit of taking drugs She doesn't understand what she does at that time She proposed that we get married yesterday night I told her there's still time for that Without understanding why, she created a mess! She started banging her head to the wall I wanted to save her under all circumstances I tried to stop her, sir But she pushed me away When I stood up and looked at her she was badly wounded on her head and Sanjana died on the spot sir My Sanjana is dead sir! Is it? Come, let's explain what happened to the police You who know me closely doubted me Now if we tell this to the cops, they will think I'm the murderer for sure If that happens, I can't go to the state level competition sir Yes, thats true. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm with you 'Sensational serial murders in city' 'Before the mystery of Hari Priya's murder that happened a month ago is solved' 'Another software employee Sanjana has been killed brutally' 'Investigation is on to determine whether it is a murder or suicide' 'There was a theft of 10 lakh rupees in that house the day the murder happened' They'd have killed her for those 10 lakhs That's how the world is! -Ravi Kiran -Sir He is detective Aditya Vardhan The DSP had specially appointed him to help us in that girl's murder case [phone rings] Hello Inspector Hello? Just a minute sir Sir, it's the DSP Good morning sir Have you got any clues? Investigation is going on sir -We'll nab the murderer in 24 hours -It's been 14 hours since the murder You've been unable to trace out even a single clue It's the sixth murder in the city already That's why I appointed detective Aditya Vardhan to help you with this case He is an expert in solving mysterious murders Please co-operate with him Sir, please listen to me Give us another two days We'll nab the murderer for sure We feel this murder was committed just for money We don't even know if this murder is related to the previous murders sir Just follow the instructions. That's it! Get all the files related to that case Krishna Rao supermarket I have to start the investigation from here [doorbell rings] Aditya: Who is that? Sir, I'm Ravi Kiran, the Head Constable The door is open. Come inside Okay sir [flush turned on] [door opens] You wanted to talk something Ravi? Well, it's nothing sir SI sir wanted me to give these to you What are they? These are the evidence found at the murder spot that day He asked me to give them to you if they are of some help I'll take leave sir Please call me if you need something sir MURDER IN SCHOOL Old murders happened similarly All of them are happening in the areas surrounding Hitech City Which means, the murderer should be around these areas Wherever you are, you can't escape [camera clicks] [doorbell rings] -Greetings sir -Namasthe He is detective Aditya Vardhan He is about to deal your daughter's murder case He wanted to see the murder location Namasthe sir Sir, we found her dead body right here on the day of her murder [camera clicks] Do you know who else was present at home on the day of murder? This door was left open on the day of murder sir The door lock is broken On the day of murder, two people entered this house without knowing about the other Two people sir? Without the knowledge of the other? But why did two people come? One for money and the other for the girl Or have they both come for the money and killed the girl by mistake? We need to clarify this How is that possible sir? Anyway, how can you say that it's two people? You need to have a proper planning for theft One has to observe this house and it's residents So, he must have planned this 10 days earlier He would have a lot of clarity about how to enter and exit this house Look, this is unplanned It's definitely the murderer who broke the window glass beside the main door Okay sir Do you doubt someone? We don't have any foes sir And no one has so much anger on us to kill our daughter Long back, someone attacked our daughter when she was coming home from work But we didn't think much about it Do you have any idea about who he could be? We thought someone attacked her for money as she was alone We didn't register a complaint as she was an unmarried girl But sometime ago, we noticed a young man named Arjun following our daughter Do you doubt he could have killed her? Er... no Do you doubt anyone in your supermarket? No sir, our employees aren't bad Okay, I've heard that she was alone at home on the night of murder Why didn't she accompany you to Annavaram? She had some work at office and said she couldn't take a leave So we both left Okay Mr. Krishna Rao... In case you doubt someone or need to contact me, this is my phone number -Okay sir -Call me -Thank you -Ravi Kiran... Yes sir... We need to meet Sanjana's close friends immediately -Sir -Get me the details Okay sir Yeah okay. I'll be there in half an hour. Okay? -Tell me Ravi Kiran -Yes sir What says our detective? Ah! I can't bear him sir! He is investigating using thrown away medicine bottles and broken window panes It's not even 24 hours since he took charge After two days of toil, he will run back saying it's unsolvable We will close the case claiming it a suicide due to lack of evidence No sir, looking at his ways, I think he might nab the murderer for sure Easy breezy... Call the hospital and inquire about the post mortem report Okay sir [to himself] I don't know how was he given this post [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] I want this. Where can I get it? Hey... stop. Hey! Stop there! You! Why is the SI here? What work does he have here? Excuse me... Why is that man here? Oh you mean SI Jayadev? He is undergoing a treatment here since six months Well, I needed a small information Tell me what you want to know sir -Serial number 11 on 20th of this month -Okay This one is burnt. I need the patient details I need to buy the medicines How is the patient related to you? Well... He's my brother Wait a minute sir Here are the details you've asked for Deva... What did you say his name is? Jayadev sir [to himself] Are Deva and Jayadev the same person? Anything else sir? Nothing. Thank you Why is Sanjana's father meeting the SI? That too at such an odd time? How are both related? Is Deva none other than this Jayadev? Why is he meeting Sanjana's father then? [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [phone ringing tone] [music mutes voice] [phone ringing tone] This is not SI's number! Deva... Krishna Rao Super Market How is Deva connected to Sanjana's father? [phone ringing tone] [phone rings] Another call from the same number... [phone ringing tone] Till now, in Sanjana's murder case There is no link between the serial murders happening in the city to this one Someone killed the girl brutally only for money is what we learnt On the day of murder 10 lakhs of cash was lost from her home [phone keeps ringing] said the girl's father Mr. Krishna Rao [panting] [panting] [train honking] [stones rattling] [train appoaching] [breathes heavily] [sighs] House numbner 23/4 -Whom are you here for, son? -Deva I'm looking for the one who works at Krishna Rao supermarket That young man vacated the place long back Vacated? Do you know where he shifted to now? I know nothing about him. Crap! Damn! Where could he be? [message tone] [gasps in surprise] Oh wow! I'm loving this place! Tiny droplets touching me... The music of waterfall... You my love beside me It's an awesome feeling Arjun! -Close your eyes once -Why? Just close your eyes! -Don't open them till I tell you. Okay? -Okay [waterfall gushing] How long? Open your eyes Surprise! Oh my god! I can't believe this! If I have any unforgettable moments in my life, they are the ones spent with you I casually said I wanted to sit before a waterfall in rain and eat an ice cream And you made it a reality! I could see a smile on your face when you were telling me I wanted to see the happiness in your face when it turns to reality Don't you have any such crazy wishes? I have a similar wish too Actually, I don't want my ice cream in a cup It should be served on my girl friend's lips Hey! Looking for an ice cream? -Want to eat ice cream? -Yeah! -Idiot! [Arjun chuckles] All naughty things after marriage! Move! Do we get married? Let's get married right here in this rain before this god if you say yes [chuckles] [rain drops pattering] "You are my love!" "I'm your love!" "You are my love!" "You are my heartbeat and everything" "The sound in heart has come on to the lips" "Sweet smiles have drizzled like rain" "All the wishes turned into breath" "They run to be with you" "All my love turned into music" "And rained a floral shower on you" "My eyes wait for you" "There's a strange turbulence in my heart after seeing you" "The sound in heart has come on to the lips" "Sweet smiles have drizzled like rain" "All the wishes turned into breath" "They run to be with you" "You are my love!"

"You're still my hearty baby, I really need you honey" "My love is very cold at day and night" "My heart is paining baby, don't treat me with anger honey" "I feel like flying round and high and high" "Happiness asked me for companionship" "Why would I specially need happiness in your companionship?" "A wonder asked me if I want to see beauty" "But you are the beauty of my world" "This ain't a dream!" "Even my dream came true!" "I can't even believe this..." "It's proved that this is for real after seeing you" "All my love turned into music" "And rained a floral shower on you" "My eyes wait for you" "There's a strange turbulence in my heart after seeing you" "The sound in heart has come on to the lips" "Sweet smiles have drizzled like rain" "All the wishes turned into breath" "They run to be with you" "I'm your love!" "You are my love!" "You are my heartbeat and everything" [sobbing] Son... son! I told you I don't know anything about him Anyway, how can you claim that two people barged in without any proofs? No! I have evidences! [scoffs] Evidence? And what is it? According to the post mortem record, it's a murder The girl was killed very brutally There is some link between the serial murders happened in the city and this one They are injecting this drug into the girl's bodies molesting them and killing them by hitting them with a strong metal rod None of these murders were committed for money They cut the dead bodies into small pieces and throw them in different places There are injection marks on this girl's body too The earlier murders of the other girls were also in the same pattern 13 murders were committed till now Only six murders are filed in our station Another seven murders have been recorded in different stations Sir, do you mean to say that it's the same person behind all these murders Yes, you got the point Then why didn't he cut this girl into pieces? Is this some other guy? Maybe it's to misguide the cops But, this murder has a lot of similarities to the past murders Oh... According to my investigation, all these murders are committed by a psycho killer But I'm sure he didn't commit the theft A psycho killer? What would he get by killing those poor girls sir? We can't say for sure why he is targeting only girls They do this because of some past events Maybe the death of their mother in their childhood and no one to care about them or maybe because their girl friend cheated them Or maybe they get some happiness by killing girls Anything could be the reason Ah! It's scary to hear sir! Don't know how they would look like? They behave very normal when in public Their original personality comes out only when they are alone Yes, he is right All these murders are committed by that psycho killer But I'm unable to understand something He has been killing one girl at a time in different areas That too he always targeted girls below age of 30 He wouldn't stop here He should have planned another murder somewhere I'm sure he would He committed all these murders by injecting this drug We will get the clue to nab him if we could trace out where we can find this [train approaching] -Vasu -Yeah According to the detective -He saw that guy with drugs in this area -Is sit? Huh! Come... hey! He's right here! Huh! Hey, catch him -Come... -Wait... [phone rings] [phone rings] Please call later Brother, could you please charge my phone? [exhales] [phone rings] [phone ringing tone] [phone rings] The person you are trying to reach [phone rings] [groans impatiently] [phone keeps ringing] -Hello -Hello [music mutes voice] My mobile phone bro Yeah, take it Excuse me... Where is the guy I called you about? He just left this way, sir -This way? -Yeah [phone ringing] -Is this the place? -Yes sir Get down This is where we should go sir [gate creaks open] What? You need some stuff? Vincent, do you recognise this guy? Who the hell are you? Why are you asking me these details Do you recognise him? [groans] Hey stop! Inspector... nab him! Hey! Stop! [phone rings] Huh? [phone keeps ringing] You... [groans] [groans] [vehicle honks] [tyres screech] Ah! God! Hey, what's that? -What are you hiding? -It's nothing sir Ravi Kiran, check it out These are clothes sir Move... Sir, there's nothing in there -Sir... -There's money in here sir Where did you get so much money from? This is my money sir -Get this guy to the station -It's mine sir -Please give it back sir -Come now! -Sir... -Get in! Move! -Sir please! -Get in maggot! [groans in pain] Please leave me sir! I'm innocent! Sir, we have Sanjana's call details [man keeps groaning] It shows the last 12 calls were made by a young man called Arjun -There are no calls recorded after that -Okay, just keep it there -All the details are in this sir -Go now Where's the money from? -Come on say the truth! -They are mine sir! Where did you get the money from? -I plead you sir! The money is mine! -Tell me the details now! -What's happening man? -Sir... Why are you making a big scene to extract a simple truth? He isn't disclosing it however I bash him sir Get to know his address and ask someone who knows him He works at Krishna Rao Supermarket sir -Come again! -Krishna Rao Supermarket sir Krishna Rao super market? -Sir please! -Hey... -I plead you -You've given us a hard time! Why did you kill that girl? Why did you have to drug that girl and kill her so brutally if it was for money? Huh? Come on tell me you! [groans in pain] I didn't do it sir. I don't have to do anything with that girl's death I plead you, please leave me sir! Hey, get the drug seller Is he the one who bought drugs from you? I've never seen this guy earlier sir Tell me the truth if it's him! No sir. This is the first time I'm seeing him -Ravi Kiran... -Sir Thrash them till they spill the beans Bash them up! -Come on tell me now! [groans in pain] [bashing and groans] Tell me! I'll tell you sir! I'll tell you the truth sir Tell me! Why did you kill that girl? Tell me! I'm in love with a girl sir But she said her parents would get her married only to a wealthy guy So I wanted to become wealthy somehow So, once I knew our owner wasn't at home that day I just stole the money that day sir I don't have anything to do with her death sir Please leave me sir! I didn't kill that girl sir -I didn't kill her sir -You didn't, eh? -Then tell me who did? -It was her boy friend Her boy friend? [sobs] Come here you! Playing around with cops, eh? [groans] I'll kill you in an encounter Tell me the truth! Who killed her? Yeah go ahead sir! Kill me! This is the truth whatever you do with me It was her boy friend Arjun who killed her As I was escaping after stealing the money, I saw Arjun at her home [door bells rings] -What did you say his name is? -Arjun, sir! 'It shows the last 12 calls were made by a young man called Arjun' -Ravi Kiran -Sir Track this number immediately I need his address and details That's not needed sir He was the first person we interrogated in this case sir -Did we interrogate him? -Yes sir! We took his fingerprints and sent him as we didn't have any evidence against him Sir! The fingerprints in the forensic reports match with the ones we have! Damn it! Both the finger prints match! How could we miss this clue all these days? Let's hurry up... move! We've got to nab him before he realises we know the truth -Come on, move! -Yes sir Sir! [snoring] [car theft alarm goes off] Hey... what's that? -Let's go check it out -Yeah [car theft alarm ringing] Just because you are with the cops, you think you escaped my wrath? You've made me an orphan again by killing Sanjana [groans in pain] He doesn't have a tattoo on his hand, so he isn't the one I'm looking for Who's he then? [phone rings] Arjun, just take it easy Relax... you have to help me What help could a common man be of to cops sir I'll ask you some simple questions Just give me genuine answers. That's the only help Did you love Sanjana? Look Arjun, you should answer It is very important for you to talk to catch the culprit Please! A lot! I've loved her more than myself, sir I'm an orphan sir Does anyone love an orphan? She did! She lived this orphan sir! Were you present there on the night that she was killed? I went to the boxing academy to practice Well, how much time did you spend at the academy that day? I was there till the morning sir Hmm... Did you speak to her on phone that day? No sir You say you haven't spoken to Sanjana But according to the phone records, you spoke to Sanjana for a long time that day There were 12 misses calls from your phone And yeah... You didn't go to the academy that day The academy security book clearly shows that Another thing is... You've met Sanjana that day for sure Is it you who killed Sanjana? Why did you kill her? [sighs] Since when do you know Sanjana? Why did you trap her on the name of love and kill her? Was it for money? Or have you lost interest in her? You've killed another 12 girls Have you trapped them in love similarly? What the hell do you get by killing those innocent girls? What are you talking sir? Why would I kill the Sanjana I loved? Which girls? You are simply trying to book cases on me I've not killed anyone sir. I've not killed Sanjana! [sighs impatiently] The proofs are strong Arjun, you can't escape I didn't even commit any crime to escape from it We have proofs that you were present there that day Have you killed Sanjana? Or just tell me how she died. I'll help you I don't need your help sir I'll myself kill the one who killed Sanjana and made me an orphan again This guy isn't going to open up. I'll make him do it Don't you get it by his words? He's talking about killing someone before the cops right in the station He is for sure the serial killer we are looking for Inspector! Inspector stop it! Please! I'm talking to him! Hitting me is easy sir... try catching the murderer Look Arjun, I'm asking you for one last time It's very important that you tell the truth Otherwise, all the proofs that we have point you out as the culprit You would go to jail and the case would be closed If at all you are innocent, would Sanjana's soul rest in peace? The real killer would actually escape. And because of you, another girl like Sanjana would face danger Think about that I'll tell you sir But not because you'd nab him or leave me Just to prove that I've not killed Sanjana And because you say another girl might face danger I and Sanjana loved each other a lot sir We wanted to marry each other too That day... Good morning Mr. Boxer! Stop over acting and come to the point -Why did you call me here? -I just wanted to see you! Easy... don't be kidding [scoffs] Okay, I have a surprise for you Close your eyes! Please! Close your eyes! Good boy! [chuckles] Ta-da! Open your eyes now This is for you! Hey! What's this now? Come to my home in the evening wearing this new pair of dress I'm throwing a party Just for you, you know! Just for me? Don't miss it! Hey! What's special about today? Surprise! [door bell rings] [Sanjana chukles] Love... I always stayed far away from it I always was irritated with you being behind me But you've made me fall for your love I never expected someone who would love me so much to enter my life I want to gift something to you, who knows nothing other than giving in love. Arjun, do you know what I'm going to gift you? It's myself. Didn't you get it? Today, I'm going to gift myself to you. I'll confess our love to my parents as soon as they come tomorrow. No one can separate us except the death. Which is why, I've come. Arjun... Who are you? Why did you come inside? Leave, else I'll call the cops! -Hey! Come... -Who the hell are you? [groans] Hey! Come... Leave me. -Hey! -[groans] Leave me! [door bell ringing] Help! [phone ringing] [dialer tone] -Leave me -[groans] [phone rings] -[sobbing] -Come! Leave me! [screams] She invited to her home and is not responding! Leave me! Hey! Sanjana. Sanjana... Sanjana... -Hey! -Oh God! [glass shatters] [groans] [groans] Hey! Hey! Hey! [screams] Leave me! Ah! Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. RIP doesn't mean... ...Rest in Peace! It means Revenge In Psycho! [sniggering] [police siren] [police siren] [sobbing] So, Arjun is also not the one who has committed this murder. Does that mean there was someone else in the house on that day, apart from Deva and Arjun? Do you want us to spare you after listening to your story? What do you think of cops? Jokers? Stop your discussions and come. You got yourself trapped by coming to the police station. -Come. -Damn it! Inspector, what is this? Mr. Vardhan, it is over! He is the real murderer according to the evidence. We cannot extend the case according to what he said. Thanks for helping us. Now you can go. It's not fair. We'll learn the truth if we give him another chance. It's not required. Arrange a press meet... -...tomorrow in the morning. -Okay, sir. All the channels should telecast that he is the murderer. -Okay? -Okay, sir. Ravi Kiran, drop him at the lodge and come back soon. -Okay, sir. -See you! [engine starts] -Ravi Kiran. -Yes, sir. Do you know the place where the girl was attacked initially? Yes, sir. Driver, take us to that place. [cicadas critter] [no audio] Hey! Bring him. Yes, sir. Come, sir is calling you. Sir. If anyone asks, tell them that he will remain in my custody until his appearance in the court. Sir, he is a poor kid! Do what I say. Come. Did you think that I will kill you in an encounter? I won't do that. We file the case on that psycho upon arresting and take him to the court. But he releases on bail and survives. I don't think it's a right way. It's not right. You should kill him. You have time till morning. Kill him. [vehicle leaving] Come, sir. Sir, the attack happened here while she was returning to her home from the office. [music mutes voice] -Ravi Kiran. -Sir. I want the CCTV footage of this ATM, the night before the attack on the girl. Have you gone crazy? Why didn't you tell us despite all this? Anyway, no one knows his whereabouts. How would we catch him? We'll get to know who is he upon decoding this date. How can we decode the date? For sure he has something to do with this date... ...as he tattooed it on his body to avoid forgetting it. He definitely belongs to some port area according to this anchor symbol. Here, look at this. -Arjun. -What is it? Both the anchor symbol which you've drawn and this one is identical. And this is the real story which had happened in Kakinada port area. His name is Kalki. He was killed by the villagers, as he was murdering in the same format as you said. His son, who fled to Hyderabad in fear is also murdering in the same pattern. Is he the killer who fled? Sir, this is the ATM CCTV footage which you've asked for. Play it. Forward it. Yeah, forward it. Hold... Please, zoom it. Pause it. Zoom it slightly. Damn it! The killer almost got caught and escaped. He has cleverly planned and ensured that his face didn't get caught by the camera. Sir, there is an ATM exactly opposite to it. Even that ATM comes under us. Good. Let's check that. Everyone who makes a mistake leaves a clue. We can search for his facebook profile if we know his name. RIP means... ...revenge in psycho. I don't know his name but I know his catchphrase. RIP doesn't mean rest in peace. It means revenge in psycho. -Arjun. -Hmm. Someone has put the tattoo which you've mentioned as his profile picture. He is the murderer. He is online now. We can find out his location if we can trace him. It doesn't take much time. Now, I've sent a link to him. The IP address will be traced out if he click this link. We can find out his location with that. -Yes! -Super, dude! Pause it. Zoom... Play it. Yes! Immediately take the screenshot of it and enlarge. Okay. He is idential to what Arjun has said. Which means, he has definitely targetted her and killed according to his plan by following her. -Mr. Ravi Kiran. -Yes, sir. I want the full details of the murders immediately. Okay, sir. Ask Sanjana's father to come here. Okay, sir. Hey sexy! Yes! Hey baby! I love this fragrance. -Do you love it too? -Who are you? Why did you bring me here? Tell me what do you want? I'll give you whatever you ask for. Would you give me? Would you give me whatever I ask for? Who are you? Why did you bring me here? Do you want to know who I am? Sir. Mr. Krishna Rao. This is the CCTV footage when your daughter was attacked for the first time. He didn't attack for money as you thought. He followed her to kill. Sir, he is Vinay. He used to work in my supermarket. Madam, here are the special corn flakes as you asked. Oh, thank you. Madam, take this too. We can make four glasses of juice with just a spoon. It helps a lot when your friends and relatives come to your home. A person like you is enough to turn a supermarket into a mall. -I'm going to Annavaram today. -Okay. -Take care of the store. Okay? -Okay, sir. -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. He is the one, sir. I gave him food when he was hungry. I gave him a job in my supermarket as he was an orphan. He killed my daughter and made me deprived of children. He is a demon, sir. Sir, such people shouldn't be alive. Kill him... So, he is the serial killer. He is working in a supermarket in the daytime and mudering the girls in the night time. What could be the motive for a guy who is working in a supermarket to kill girls? You might've seen many guys, who chase beautiful girls for love. I'm the kind of person who chases the girls for their death. Damn! You aren't a human. You are an animal. Please, leave me... Leave me... -Please, leave me... -I'll leave you. Leave me... I'll leave you. Leave me. [groans] [anchor clunks] Hey! Are you alright? Hope you aren't hurt! Hey, wait! Hey! Hey! [groans] Hey! [sniggering] [footsteps] [groans] [groans] [shouts] [groans] [groans] Come, you bloody! [scoffs] Come... [groans] Hey! Ouch! -How could you kill my Sanjana? -[groans] Why did you kill my Sanjana? She is not yours but she is mine. You came in between us. I would've killed her after raping, if you weren't there. I thought of raping and killing her while she was returning from the office. But you came. I thought of killing her again. Then you came again. Now, that girl... No, your girl... I killed her in front of you by molesting her. Hey! Hey! [groans] I would've killed you at that time... ...if I had known that you would be back by recognising me. But I'll kill you before regretting of killing her. Even Ravana couldn't escape from death who didn't even touch Sita Devi. You killed Sanjana in front of me. Your death is confirmed. Hey! Hey! [groans] [groans] The blood is still wet. Which means he has again attacked some other girl. Let's go and see there. Come on. Arjun. You go from here and I'll take care of everything. Come on, go. Take him. [gun shots] The psycho killer who is raging sensation in the city, was encountered by the cops in the city outskirts today in the morning. Sanjana. You came into my destination-less life like a Goddess. The way I followed you, your association, your friendship... your love, your kiss, the time spent with you, are beautiful memories. Your memories are my strength. I see your smile when I close my eyes. That is making me move forward. I believe that your soul would rest in peace, as I killed the man who made us apart. I wanted to live with you in my next birth. Love means living. I'll survive with your memories. I miss you Sanjana. I miss you. "I don't exist and won't return ever" "and this is destiny" "Once you know this truth," "your journey has to go on"
