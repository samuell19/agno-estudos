You woke up so early. Let's play. - Play what? - Play... Play... Why did you hit me? When did I hit you? He did it. Sue Chen, answer the phone... - Hello? - Sue Chen, you dropped the ball! - What? - Do you know you listed the price wrong! Didn't you bring your brain to work? You idiot! Has the product been removed? - Removed? - What's the sales volume now? More than 1,000 pieces were sold! - More than 1,000 already? - It's too late. How did this happen? The company is doomed because of you! How can I answer to our manufacturers now? Hey! Are you listening to me? - Sue Chen, where are you? - You bastard. You called me a bastard? Sorry, sir. I wasn't talking to you. Did you actually double-check the retail price? You just can't work without me eyeing on you! Give me a break. Give you a break? I'm going to break you. Are you tired of living? Get in the office! Now! Sorry, sir. I wasn't talking to you. Quickly! Instantly! Right now! I'm on my way. I'm sorry. "Sales Manager" Are you trying to play victim to gain sympathy? I'm sorry. How is it possible to price a 12,500NTD product as 1,250NTD? The Consumer Protection Office demanded us to deliver the product as priced. Maybe it's because the '0' key suddenly broke down. If the client holds us accountable, I think our company will go bankrupt. Sir, I'll call the client right now and beg for mercy. Listen, Sue. Can't you tell that I am suggesting you take up the responsibility by quitting? Sir. I've been working so hard all these years... Of course! Since you've been working so hard all these years, I will recommend you a good temple to get rid of your bad luck. Seriously? I'm logged out already? Elevator going up. Elevator going up. Going up. Please take a look. Thank you. If we look back in history, since the Stone Age, people have learned to exchange shells for drinks. Hi, please take a look. Thank you. Miss, take a look at these units. If we look at the society today, - our days are comprised... - Thank you. ...of countless commercial activities. Going to the office? Sue, happy birthday! May you stay beautiful forever, just like me. Successful sales are like magic. It can make people lose their heads, impelled to take money out of their wallets. Go get a bottle of makeup remover. On the other hand, unsuccessful sales is enough to push people into the darkest abyss. Because of a goddamn "zero," my life returned to zero. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Honey. Happy birthday! I'm not in the mood. Today is so not my day. I had a bad feeling when I asked the part-timer to key in the prices. I just knew it! He didn't even ask me to double-check. Just forget it for now. Look! The steak is so beautifully grilled. I'm so glad that I get to see such a beautiful scene before I die. You've such an outstanding marketing talent, you'll surely be offered a well-paid job very soon! After making such a huge mess, I must have been blacklisted by all major companies already. Don't deny yourself completely. Everyone makes mistakes. - You're so professional. - Sue Chen, answer the phone... See? People are calling you already. Sue Chen, answer the phone... "Mom" It's Mom. Hello? Hello? Sue? Happy birthday. Are you two coming back for dinner? Kai and I are eating out. Don't worry. Hold on. Your dad wants to talk to you. Hey, sweetie. Good luck with your career! What career? You should ask her to bear me a grandson as soon as possible. When I was your age, you were already going to kindergarten. I don't understand you young people. You're so loud! Stop playing the drums. You never stop. Are you coming back or what? It's okay if you don't want dinner, I'll just play for you as celebration. You're so annoying! Coming back just to see you play? Time for bed. Yes. Let me update my resume first. Honey, take your time looking for a new job. I'm here for you. You're right. Well then, please bestow the money for this month's rent, water, electricity, gas, auto maintenance, insurance, credit card interest, and my humble allowance. I mainly worked on general repairs this month, are you okay with less allowance? Before talking like a rich, handsome guy, check what you've got first. Here. Alright. What? You don't think I've got enough? Look, my belly... So fat and tender, I'm a man of weight. Others have weight in the pocket, why do you have it in your belly? How I wish they could be switched. I just learned this recently. It's not so pretty. It is pretty. I like it. Honey, keep it up. Whatever you do, I'm here for you. Thank you. So you worked for the same company since you graduated from university? Yes. I have been working in the marketing department with great performance and a perfect attendance record. Why did you suddenly decide to quit and change your career path? My previous job was stable, but I want to challenge myself. You said that sales are your passion. Why? When my parents were young, they started their own direct sales business. But they failed and became deep in debt. They had no choice but do something else. In the end, even their family and friends were dragged into the mess. My mother ended up working at a restaurant. My father chose to become a counselor, listening to others' miseries all his life. After he retired, he started pursuing his dream as a drummer. I want you to introduce yourself... Not your ancestors. Sorry. So since I was a child, I've been telling myself that I must make my parents proud and make their dreams come true. You want to make their dreams come true, then what about your own dreams? You said you want to challenge yourself by changing your career path, but weren't you fired by your previous company for wrong pricing? Are you sure you really love marketing? Everyone has something to say about their dreams. This is our feature for today. What is your dream? Something unrealistic. World peace. - Betty Lu. - Stop aging. What is your dream? Get a raise? That's it! I can't just tell the interviewers that my dream is to make a million bucks a year, right? That doesn't sound passionate at all. Ms. Chen, the rent for this month is not received. Don't forget. Why can't leading a peaceful and stable life be a dream? What if I can never find another job? Come on! Interviews are just lying competitions. You have to stay calm and cool while telling sob stories. Otherwise, you'll never be hired. Just leave your pride behind and steal some lines from fairy tales. Fine! My dream is to travel back in time and fire that goddamn part-timer who ruined my life! Don't you throw up! Swallow it back! Kai. Over here. Swallow it back. Honey. How did you get this drunk? Put on your jacket. It was not my fault. - Why am I to blame? - Your hand. Alright, honey. Let's go home, okay? No! Heartless, unfaithful bastard. Let's go home. Come on. Excuse me. Sorry. Let's go. "Dumplings in the rice cooker if you're hungry." "Sober Up's here if you have a hangover." "Rent paid, don't worry. I'll take care of everything." "P.S. You're the best!" Honey, I'll work hard. Welcome home. Surprise! You guys... Who are you? I'll call the police. Go ahead, let me dial for you. Hello! 911 here. I'm Tsai, how can I help? Hello, 911. Do you need any help? Hello? - Otherwise... - Hello? ...just spit out all the money you took. Stop! Don't use violence. That's not elegant at all. Sherlock Holmes? You must be tired of being on the run. Think about your family. Your adorable daughter must be missing her father badly. She's pretty cute. Don't harm my daughter. No problem! Just show me your... "sincenty." Sincerity. It's time for Mei to bring you some good news! Do you have furkids at home? Do you? You're itching here and itching there. Sweetie, are you itching all over your body? If so, let me tell you, you're allergic to the fur. What do you think? Isn't she awesome? Amazing? This kind of marketing talent is exactly what we are looking for right now. Sir, this isn't the kind of job I was looking for. But you said you're interested in all kinds of marketing jobs. Right. But I was once a supervisor. So this kind of sales job is really... Tear off a piece of paper. Really what? Just be frank. It's okay. Right, put it back like this. Sir, I was actually looking for a Marcom job. Marcom? Marketing and Communication. Isn't this the perfect fit? This is a hypermarket. Right? You can have direct, one-to-one communication with the clients. You can even do one-to-ten. No problem at all. Sir, this job is really not what I imagined. Besides, I think sales... "Your balance due on the last credit card statement" "is 32,586NTD." So you mean, you can't handle this job, right? I think I should take up the challenge. We should always try new things. That's the spirit! We should have the courage to take up new challenges, right? Welcome to our big family. Welcome. Hold on. Thank you. Sorry. - What are you looking at? - What are you looking at? I'm sorry. Let me wipe it for you. All right. Hey, it's my floor! Boss, who's our next target? Before we take action, I want to tell you a story. A depressing love story. Many years ago, I set up a private investigation agency with a woman named Rose. I often wrote love poems for her. We had lots of precious memories. One day, I went to the office as usual, and saw that the office was packed with carton boxes from a direct sales company. The cash in the safe and all other valuables were gone. I'm only left with... When you are reading this, I'm already gone. Those boxes in the office are the only things I can leave you. If you can sell all of them, the company will be saved. Hang in there! Rose! No wonder you have a Diamond Sales Achievement trophy. That's right. I'm the top salesperson who set the sales record at Newly. I've heard that this woman is back in town. I am definitely through with her this time. I'll take back everything that belongs to me. Is there any picture with higher resolution? Come on over here. Anyone watched Harry Potter? - Raise your hand. - I have. Yes. You've all watched it. Do you know how Harry Potter flies? On a broom. Let me tell you, this apple juice is not sugary at all. We can easily sweep the hair... Touch it. Right... Sold out? Here you go. Thank you. If you need anything, just come to me. Okay. Thank you. Do you know how awesome this infrared roaster is? Any idea? Let me tell you. It has 360-degree rotation. How does it rotate? Look at it. Also, on our roaster... Here they are, how come it takes so long? So many models. Which do we choose? - Ya, this looks okay. - Hi. Hi, miss. My daughter just got a job. I'd like to buy her a digital camera as a gift. What would you recommend? Anything? Sir. Summer is coming. Don't you feel that there are many mosquitos? Aren't you bothered by mosquitoes? Not really. It's winter now and I have an LED mosquito trap. No. Nowadays, mosquitoes are very clever. They don't fly into the trap themselves. They have to be killed by your hand. Otherwise? You're good. I can't catch any with my hand. You found a job right after graduation? I haven't graduated yet. She hasn't graduated yet, but got an offer from a foreign company. My family and friends told me that I can retire and enjoy life now. But sir, I think it's better not to retire too early. Young people these days are all cheap laborers with very little stability. Companies are profit-oriented places. You're expected to be overworked. If you make a mistake, you deserve to be fired. Your achievement goes to the manager. And you can only keep the blame to yourself. Sir. This one has a one-year warranty. 12.42 megapixel. - No, thank you. - Sir... What about a catalog? The secret of killing mosquitoes is the following the steps. Keep a close eye on your target and catch it with no mercy. Got it! No mosquitoes can escape my palm. You're really good. See? No need to buy any electric swatter. You can't let customers lead you by the nose! I don't expect outstanding sales from newcomers, but it can't be zero either. This is not okay. You have to work hard. But I really don't know how to peddle. Have you got a mouth? Do you speak Mandarin? So what's the problem? But I'm really thin-skinned. Why do you have to be thick-skinned to be a salesperson? I don't get it. Do you despise this job? Of course not. All professions are equal, whether you're a janitor or a politician. What you've just said is totally the opposite. If those hardworking janitors know that you compared them to the politicians, how insulted would they feel? Sue, don't be so nervous. Relax. No one despises you. You're the only person who despise yourself. Got it? Free samples here. It's yummy. You just have to heat it up before you eat. Miss, it's very tasty. Easy to heat up. Sue! Mom! What are you doing here? I'm here for a new project. Market research. I see, hypermarkets have to have some promotions or discounts, right? Not bad. What's this? Looks delicious. But it looks a bit burnt. Hey, I'll buy three packs. What are you waiting for? Get me three packs. Here. Don't starve yourself. Bye. They provide home service if there are any problems. Good morning, senior! You haven't quit yet? I was too naive. I underestimated this job. Now I want to start over. Could you please give me some advice? Oh dear, how do I dare to? You're once a supervisor. How do I dare to teach you anything? Selling things is very easy, isn't it? You just have to drop one zero from the price and people will snap it up like hell. Am I right? Isn't it easy? Don't laugh. Hurry, time to work! Hey, who's in charge of the fresh food area? Okay, don't be late. The four steps of debt collecting. Watching. Searching. Talking. And tying. This is the standard operation procedure. What you two have to do now is watching. Boss, with today's technology, you can do that more efficiently. You can find someone to install CCTV here and monitor it at any time. Honey, are you home? Can you bring me my spare toolbox? Kai! Kai Fang! Nice to meet you, Rose. I'm not Rose. I knew that you'd deny it. But I can read your mind. If you can read my mind, you should know that I'm really not Rose. You can deny it. It's okay. Since you ran into me, it means you've run out of luck. Rose. What are you trying to do? Get out of here! Prada, calm down. I don't think she's Rose. I told you! She is! She has the exact same hairstyle. That's true. Why did you give in? You don't want to admit it? - I'll beat you up if you don't. - Go on. - I'll hit you like this! - Scary, right? I'm really not the person you're looking for. I'll blow your head off. 5 million dollars, not a penny less. Yes. I don't have that much money. Take this business card. Just tell them that Jack introduced you. Someone will take care of you and teach you how to make fast money. I don't sell my kidney, let alone my body. It's a TV shopping channel. According to insider information, they'll be selling some high-priced luxury goods soon. All you need to do is to steal some products and sell them. You want me to steal? Or do you prefer selling your kidneys? Here, speak to the camera. I, Rose... Get rid of all those goddamn cans! She's not Rose. Idiot. I told you I'm not Rose. - Well... - Hey. - Sorry... - Sorry... What took you so long? I was worried that something might have happened to you. I did run into a few nuts... Alright. Wait for me in the cafe there. We'll go home together later. Can you really teach me the secrets of sales? Sorry... Can I keep this business card? You are interested in shopping channels? Do you want to learn the art of sales? Just ask me about it. I'll teach you as my apology. My parents worked their butt off but they still couldn't get any commendation. I truly envy glib talkers like you. I'm actually very shy. You're very shy? Right, I'm so very shy. I'm afraid of talking to strangers. Then how do you promote your products? I don't promote them. I act. You know... Roleplay. I play a salesperson. You don't really have to show the clients the real you. Imagine, sales is like a performance. Put on your mask. Leave your true personality behind. Mask on! From now on, you're no longer the very shy Sue Chen. You're a professional actress. You are a glib talker. Every time you peddle, you sell things. You're acting in a great play. The role you play is someone who can read the client's mind, someone who knows the way to the client's heart. A top salesperson! "Sales Chart" Mask on! Pretty ladies, you two look so much alike. Are you sisters? No, she's my mom. Your mom? How do you take care of your skin? You look so young. Hot product of the Farmer's Association. Try it. Don't worry, this is 100% natural. Sir, don't you feel super uncomfortable when your pores are clogged, like a clogged toilet or the highway on New Year's Eve? So painful. Exactly. Tell me, which one do you prefer? They're not so different. You have to make a comparison. Otherwise, how would I know? You can study the products by yourself. What I do is to discover different faces of your personality. Now, tell me, what color are you? I don't know. Come on! A salesperson has to have a good imagination to trigger clients' expectations. The more colorful you are, the more eye-catching you are. Now, tell me, why does everyone need a digital camera? I'm here to tell you about this camera. We take photos of beautiful sceneries from the mountain to the sea. This camera is awesome for taking selfies. Vibration-proof, distortion-proof. You'll look like a supermodel in the photo. It keeps you in a good mood every day. It's also shatterproof. Wherever you drop your camera, it'll still be in one piece when you pick it up. You can play with it the whole afternoon. Cutie, - how much are you willing to pay? - 5000NTD. 5000NTD! You understand its value. Really, take one home now! "Sales Chart" "Catching up" This is an exfoliating gel. Ladies, would you like to try? See for yourself. Is there a difference? - There is, right? - Now, tell me, what color are you? Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet... I am every color! At home, I'm yellow. In the crowd, I'm red. Wherever I am, I'm always the most eye-catching color! Mask on! I'm the Ace of Sales, Sue Chen. Outstanding achievement. "Outstanding" Listen. The success of Sue is the biggest miracle in human history. I'm just joking. Here you go, bonus time. - Mei, thank you for your hard work. - Thank you, boss. Sue, this is yours. - Thank you, boss. - Look, they're your role models. I hope you can keep it up. Alright, I'll leave you alone. Have fun. - Okay. - Thank you, boss. How many people were arranged to buy your products? That's not the case. I worked really hard. No arrangements? What? You bought those things yourself? You have to cover so many sales alone? You worked hard. So you borrowed money from loan sharks? I've got a good coach. So, maybe I can catch up to in the next month. Sure, I've been number 1 for so long. I really hope someone can outperform me. It's such a shame though. Hey, guys. I am leaving! I'm going to be a shopping host at a shopping channel. From now on, this monkey is your new king. - Senior... - Senior... - Senior. - We can't bear for you to leave. It's not a big deal. I just really enjoy improving myself. I'll become an even better salesperson there. Don't worry. - Do visit us. - Sure, no problem. Sweetie, congratulations for conquering the peak again. I knew it. You're as outstanding as me. Thank you, dad. Cheers. But, Sue, is it possible for you to get promoted? You don't need to sell random stuff forever, right? That's why I'm thinking about a career change. I'd like to try shopping channels. Shopping channels? You want to be a star? No, a shopping host. I don't like this idea. Showing yourself on TV. What's wrong with that? You don't think I've got the face to show? I don't mean that. I heard that it's really stressful to work there. Competition among co-workers is malicious. Every job is stressful. Besides, didn't you say that whatever I do, you're there for me? Then find... a friendlier job. My high school mate's company is hiring. - I'll give him a call. - No, thanks. I think sales jobs are perfect for me. Yes. Otherwise, people don't get to see your slender legs. Alright, let's enjoy dinner now. We'll talk about it later. It won't... What's the point of doing that? "Good Buy TV Shopping" I have a lot of friends with kids. They hope that there is a good children's book that can lead our kids into a more creative and inspiring world. Today, I'm here to introduce you a very well-crafted children's book authorized by Italy's Bologna Illustrators Exhibition. To celebrate the launch of this product, the publisher offers us a discounted package only for today. Can someone please bring me the poster board? Yes, please... Dear parents, don't forget, children have only one childhood, they can't afford to wait. If you miss this discounted package, when is your next chance? Actually, I don't know either. We're really grateful for this discounted offer today. It's such a good bargain. Let's have a look at it now. The Oscars of illustration... What the hell is this? "Taiwanese me, be strong! Get it up." "With this, it will never go down." Play the third clip of V2. We'll be back in 5 minutes. What the hell? I'm screwed! Are you from our rival company? I'm sorry. Prick! Who are you? How did you get in here? You idiot! You can't tell that a passerby entered? Are you blind or what? Why didn't you put the poster board back to the right place? I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm not a passerby. I was told to come to the studio for an interview. Interview? Interview my ass! Get her out of here! Over here! - I'm sorry. - Sorry? What's the point? How did she get in here? Over there! Thank you. I'm really sorry. Thank you. Sue Chen. Senior. What are you doing here? I'm here for an interview. For the TV shopping host job? - Yes. - You're such a copycat. What can you do? You want to work here? Or do you have a thing for me? You're stalking me? Senior, I just want to learn from you. I look forward to your guidance. - Well, don't. I have nothing to... - Next group. Wang Tie-nan, Liu Fen, Sue Chen, Chen Ting-wei, Mei Lin. You look pale. Go touch up your lipstick. Go, you need to. Hi, everyone. My name is Wang Tie-nan. My friends call me "Little Cutie." I've passed high levels for the general English exam. And I also have certificates for babysitting, culinary... No pay no gain, so I demand minimum pay of 45,000NTD a month, plus, performance bonus. I'm definitely worth much more than my pay. My name is Sue Chen, Sue as in superwoman. Diligence is my middle name. I've worked in digital marketing for 8 years. I've also created a record of "fastest sales growth" as a new employee in a hypermarket. As a top salesperson at a hypermarket for 5 years in a row, I am not like those people who had rapid sales growth by sheer dumb luck. My reputation is built on my sales performance. I am an extremely prudent person. I would never drop a zero in retail prices, sell the product at the wrong price and cause a loss of a few million. Excuse me. I want to elaborate. Although my sales experience is not as impressive as hers, I've worked on sales strategies for many branded luxury goods and high-priced products. I don't only sell mops, brooms, and scouring pads. I am also very familiar with all luxury brands. Excuse me. I want to elaborate a bit too. I'm always learning new things to improve myself. I speak French, so I can pronounce luxury brands correctly. Bonjour. My name is Mei. I don't speak French. Thank you. I study foreign languages too! Hello. Nice meeting you. My name is Sue Chen. You bad boy. Thank you. Nobody gets it. Apart from languages, I'm also very good at dancing. I know all the dance moves like Salsa. Salsa. Cha-cha. I'm especially good at Hip-hop. I can do yoga! I love pursuing the balance between body and mind. My body is very flexible. I do a lot of yoga after work. Do you think only you can do that? I learned 13 claps. 13. What's that on the table? I just wanted to pamper you with fruits and snacks today. Go wash your hands. No need to get changed. I can sit on the sofa without getting changed? Go on. Are you sure? Hey, my friend is really hiring a marketing executive. Prepare your resume and send it to him. I went to the shopping channel for an interview today. I told you not to go. I can't work at the hypermarket for the rest of my life. This is the life-changing opportunity in my life. I don't want to miss it. The hypermarket job is just a transition. I thought Marcom is your dream job? I thought you want to be a brand manager... I'd like to challenge myself with this new job. There are two main points. First, your accessory breast won't be hanging there. Second, it can support and push up your breasts. Have you ever heard of bazooka? The shape of your breast... This is the new job you're challenging yourself with. Take off your mask and wake up. What's wrong with this job? I'm not stealing or robbing from anyone. I often hear men talking like this when walking behind women, "Look at that woman in front of you. She looks like the Michelin man from behind. Have you even seen the Michelin man?" Take off your mask. Wake up. Apparently, he simply doesn't want me to show my face in public. This is the 21st century! - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey. Hold on. I thought you hated selling things. How did you change so much in just a few days? Because I don't want to be taken advantage of, I don't want to be disposable anymore. I want to impress those who don't take me seriously, those who don't believe I can make it. Call Department confirmed 19,876 deals for last week. That means 2,840 a day on average. 33% are beauty products, and 28% are 3C products. Customer Service Department received 1,638 calls last week. 39% are about exercise equipment assembling. 26% are about missing parts of free gifts for home appliance purchase.

Gold and Silver, I only achieved 60% the last time... This time, I wish to achieve 100%... Good morning, Ann! I'm your partner today... Quiet. Please have some more energy drinks and strengthen my sales performance today. Thank you, Gold and Silver. Your turn. Pray with both hands. More sincerely. Do you know who they are? They're Pixiu. They fetch money with their mouths. Besides, they only have mouths. They don't have... You know, back doors. So all the money is kept in their stomachs. If you make offerings to them, you can make a fortune. Would you like to keep two too? Give me your pass. This one. Gold and Silver, this is Sue Chen, my partner for today. Please help us and let all our telephone lines stay occupied from the beginning to the end. Introduce yourself to Gold and Silver. Hi, Gold and Silver. My name is Sue Chen. Please help us. Thank you. By the way, you're a newbie. You have to visit the BS Temple. Your prayers will be answered. Then you'll get an official contract after the probation period. Got it? Okay. Now, do what I do. Try to scoop the energy to your body. When you do this, open your nostrils to inhale the air. Here we go. Right, one more time. Do you feel the wealth in the air now? All lines will be occupied. After this, say thank you to them. - Thank you, Gold and Silver. - Thank you, Gold and Silver. I'll be working with Producer Chou today, but our client doesn't have much confidence in the product. Please help us. Let us hit the sales target on our first try. This month's sales performance is all depending on this product. Please help us, Gold and Silver. Please have some more energy drinks. "Fortune amulets" Okay. This is our studio. This is our cameraman for Camera 1. Hi. This is our FD, Chi Ang. Hi. Okay, that's enough. Thanks. Here, you can see the deal updates. You know what the last word means, right? Okay, let's practice with the camera switch now. Can you see the numbers - on these three cameras? - Yes. So when the light is on, just look at that camera. See? 3, 2. Good, you're doing pretty good. Sue, it's your turn. 3. It's on 2 already. Faster. 1. Sue, you can practice at your own time. Now, I'll teach you how to display the products in our live shows. We usually hold the poster board with our left hand and point with our right hand. Leave us alone! Don't forget to look at the cameras while you're pointing. Don't hold it too high. Otherwise, people will see your mouth and the product on camera. So we usually hold it in front of our chest and look at the camera. No, it's the problem with the framing. Girls don't like these angles at all. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Our two new colleagues are here to say hi. This is our PD Box. They're the producers. Kui and Chou. Hi, Kui and Chou. They're in charge of the flow of the show. Most importantly, we're their mouths. Whatever they tell you in the earphone, you'll have to say it right away. She's that bubble brain! Who hired her? Okay. Thank you. Wu and Liu here, our directors. They're in charge of visual presentation and camera switch. This cute guy and pretty lady here are the aces of our merchandise development, Peter and Judy. They're the people who decide what we sell here. They make the call. During pre-production meetings, producers, TV hosts, merchandise development, and client representatives work together on the positioning of the products we're going to launch, as well as how to sell them to our target consumer groups. Ladies, vacuuming robots can help you clean the floor, but what about cleaning the glass? What kind of help have we got? Today, I'm here to show you a magical product. Go ahead, Mei. Yes, Jun. Look, when we put this machine on the glass, it's just like when a great white shark sees fishes, all the dirt is eaten up! Isn't it amazing? 3, 2... Luffa water is also called beauty water. When it's applied to our skin, it has moisturizing, whitening, and anti-aging effects. Do you want to learn more about this product? Let's hear what Sue has to tell us. Yes, Ann. Here is our luppa gift box... "Luffa." It includes luffa soap, luffa cleanser... Read it according to the order. And luffa water. Plus? Buy two, get one free. Plus two luffa skincare sets. What's the total value? The total value is 2,300NTD... 3,200NTD. What are you saying? Today, you only have to pay... Today you only have to pay 7,888NTD. I think Sue is just nervous. Right here, right now, we'll cut the price by 6,000NTD. You can take it home for only 1,888NTD. Sue. Right? Sue? Mask on! Mask on! I am the Ace of Sales, Sue Chen. That's right. Listen. Our shocking price for today is 1,888NTD. I was so shocked that I made a slip of the tongue! Don't miss this great chance! Call in now. As a newbie, Mei is very talented and stable. She will be promoted to official host for sure. Sue Chen is far behind her. She can't catch up with Ann's pace at all. I think Sue has great potential though. She's more persistent than we thought. Persistent? What's the use of being persistent? No sales growth. Lingering around. That's even worse. Ann, what do you think? I think Sue may not be as talented as Mei, but she just needs to practice a bit to catch up with the pace. Both of them can stay. Oh my god. This is even more boring than staring at an aquarium. At least there is fish swimming around in an aquarium. I agree. I'm done. I think I'm done. Me too. Prada, wake me up later. Did anyone call for an electrician? No. That's weird. Someone asked me to come here. It's me. You installed that CCTV across the street, didn't you? You got the wrong person. It doesn't matter. I'd like you to take it down for me. I can't. They're really weird. So it was you. No... Why did you do this? The CCTV is really none of my business. It's not up to me. Sorry, don't give me that look. My father passed away when I was little... My mom has been ill. I had to work when I was little. I finally managed to save some money, but they took it all. Why are they watching you? I don't know, but I really just want to make money to pay for my mom's medication. If this goes on, they'll take away my money again. Mister, please, please let me go. Mister, please. Give me a break. Mister. You get nervous too easily. Weren't you a frontline salesperson? Why are you still so nervous? Maybe it's because I'm stupid. My rehearsals at home went well, but when I saw the cameras, I forgot everything. Besides, their orders in the earphone were so terrifying. What's so terrifying about it? Think about it, you have so many advantages. The only thing you lack is composure. Imagine, all cameras are wealthy customers, just think "buy, buy, buy" when you see them. Simple as that. Got it? Go get ready now. Good morning, Mary. Mary seems to hate me. That's not true. Don't think too much. She's always like that. Low sales performance, failed the final exam. She's afraid of being replaced, that's why she sees you newbies as enemies. Final exam? The children's book. That was her last chance. Sadly, she didn't hit the sales target. It's all your fault. I screwed it up for her. Don't think too much. That product wasn't selling well anyway. It was just the difference between C- and C. Hey, I really don't get it. Why don't you just move to another place? I have nowhere else to go. Are you taking me home then? Never mind. This is not going anywhere. Go in first. I'll take the CCTV down for you. Thank you, mister. You really are my only hope. Let me go. Get over here. Yes, run. Long time no see, Rose. Jack, we are at the point of no return. Please forgive me. I... I didn't mean to do it. Whatever happened in the past, let it go. Now, money is everything. Pay up. But I lost it all. I thought they swindled your money? Why should you pay them back? You believe women's words? They all have several masks, talking out of both sides of their mouths. I agree. Not me. I'm really penniless. Otherwise, with my good taste, would I live in a tin shack like this? She's really broke. I even had to pay for the coffee we just had. Shut up! Who are you to have coffee with her? He's my boyfriend. - This guy here? - I'm not... Good. If you want to be with her, pay up for her. 100,000NTD a month with 5% interest. Let me warn you, don't ever think about running away again. No trickery with that CCTV either. I'll be watching you wherever you are. How dare Rose treat me like this! Keep an eye on that electrician! Greet him three times a day. Make him pay up! Sorry. I didn't mean to drag you into this. It's okay. At least they didn't give you a hard time. But... I don't mind turning the lie into reality. Sorry. I appreciate your kindness. I'll try to do something about the CCTV. Isn't that last year's design? - You must attend my wedding. - Yes, Annie's... Here. - Okay. Tiffany, you must come. - I haven't seen you for a while. How's the new job? I want to die. Don't ask if you're my bestie. You... Is this Sue? Long time no see. I'm getting married. Don't forget to come to my wedding. - Okay. - Come and share my joy. Enjoy. - Who's that? - Johnny. Halle Chia. You couldn't recognize her either? I heard that she went to study in Korea, and after she came back... You get it. Hi, classmates! It's been a long time. Halle has something to say here. I met my fiance on a beach in Hawaii. He was in a Dior suit, standing alone in the sunset glow. He looked so blue, deep in thought. Just like a black hole. That's how I fell in love with him. He sounds like a hot guy. Please. Who would go to the beach in a suit? Sometimes I wonder if I'm too blessed. - Congratulations! - Thank you. My treat today. Giving out invitations 800 years ahead... Is she afraid that no one will show up? "He was in his Dior suit, standing alon in the sunset glow. He looked so blue, deep in thought. Just like a black hole." Only a black hole can take in an artificial person like her. But her hubby does look hot and handsome. Cute guys are either playboys or gay. What's good about it? A good husband is someone like your Kai, considerate, down-to-earth, and most importantly, he has nothing to offer to other women. "Good Buy TV Shopping" I'll start the introduction with needs. Okay, you do that. And I'll elaborate with the introduction of the machine and the interface. When the camera is on this panel, we'll play the video clip. Director, we have 3 video clips. Please double-check the sequences for me. Okay. No problem. Who says so? I marked it, okay? Hi, Boss. Go on. Anyway, we'll give you the benefit. Kui, the model had a car accident on the way. She won't make it. What? You're trying to give me trouble? We're going live soon. Call another agency. Or you prefer to be on camera yourself? Have you got the face, the boobs, and the slim waist? If you can't find someone, don't show up again! Well then, let Sue give it a try. Working out has become a new trend. Some people want to shape up. Some people want to take care of their health. But the weather is usually a big obstacle. - Too cold to work out in winter... - Yes. ...and too hot in summer. So what should we do? Exactly. That's why a lot of people choose to work out in a gym. But don't forget, you have to pay membership fees and monthly fees. - That's quite some money. - Good, very good. - Not cheap at all. - Sue, keep jogging. Don't stop. Camera 4, tilt up from her legs. A smarter and economical solution. White Genius 2. Yes, this treadmill allows you to bring home not only the gym, but also the coach. Right, let's ask our model how she feels jogging on it. How do you feel? Is it easy to use? Yes, it feels so easy. Besides, the control panel shows that I've burnt 500 kcal already! 500 kcal. Hello. Hello? Do you need repair services? Do you know the owner of this number? Did you call me? Mr. Fang. You're the only contact in her call log. We can't contact the police. Thank you for coming. In the ladies' room. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Miss Rose. Rose! Where is the money? Aren't you paying them back for me? "Sober Up for you if you have a hangover." "500NTD under your pillow, get some food." "If you need help, let me know." "It's dangerous to get drunk in a nightclub." Into the bag, throw up into the bag. It's okay if you don't want to throw up. Water? Silly boy... Mary! Mary. I'm sorry. I ruined your most important show. Since I started working here, I've been too stressed. I've never been healthy. My voice is ruined too. I kept telling myself, "just hang in there a bit more." "Hang in there a bit longer and you'll succeed." But it seems like reality is not like a TV series. I'm not cut out for this job. If you want to succeed in this industry, there are too many factors involved. Skills and connections are necessary, but opportunity and luck play a bigger role. I once thought that my performance was outstanding, so I started to be picky with the products. I don't want to sell vulgar ones, and don't bother with those I didn't like. I forgot that our job is to create demand. Without the products, we're nothing. As for you, you make a fool of yourself all the time, but at least you work hard and you've got passion. All you need to do is seize and create opportunities and produce excellent results. If you can't take it anymore, leave. Stop wasting your youth. The counter is wearing out. Boss. What's wrong? Why are you spacing out here? Mary left. She failed to hit sales target for three months in a row. If a senior like her can be fired, I'm worried that I can't achieve excellent sales performance. Mary is past her prime. She's not appealing to the new audience. But you are different. I've always wanted to become a shopping host. I'll let myself down if I fail to hit my quota. Don't worry. I have faith in you. Hello, everyone. I am Sue, who helps you keep your perfect body shape. This is our product of the day: Spinner bike. Spinner bikes all look pretty much the same. But this one is different. Let's have a look at the panel first. The display is simple and user-friendly. It's really easy to read, you've got the speed, time, distance and calorie burnt. No, thanks. This is what's left from that 500NTD. How did you find me? The first time we met, I already put the GPS tracker into your toolbox. Why me? Because... you look like an easy target. But I picked the wrong one. Hey. Are you okay? Finding out what kind of person you are... Is it good or bad? I didn't do anything. I know. Most men think with their penis, but you're a man without a penis. I'm afraid you'll have to stay single forever. I'm married. Your wife must be a village girl. That's my wife. Being single is sad, but having an illusion is pathetic. I'm not joking. Of course. And Chris Hemsworth is my hubby. "Spouse: Sue Chen" I thought you were a real gentleman. So it's just because your wife is so hot that you don't need to "go out and cool down." To be honest, I'm not sure if she's my wife anymore. She has changed so much since she started working at the TV shopping channel. I can help you. I'll let her wake up to reality and leave the company. Really? You can convince her to leave the shopping channel? Of course. I just happen to hate this kind of job very much too. It's so easy to shape yourself up! Yes, shape up like Sue! What a slut. Those guys are totally fooled by her. I heard that she has dinner with top management every day. I've heard that too. Why? She is getting all the advantages. In what sense am I, Mei, not comparable to her? Alright. I know it's true. I don't have her figure and her look. But I know all of our products. Super well. I'm not going to be defeated by a pretty face. What's wrong, Sue Chen? We didn't mean anything really. We were just saying that... This bird looks like a pretty vase. Enjoy the vase. It's her. I heard that she's flirting with Boss. - Really? - You haven't heard? Here she is. Mei. I have a lot of respect for you. But why are you always picking on me? Is it because you're jealous of me? What for? Mask on! Because nobody wants you even if you sell yourself for nothing. Does playing dirty tricks like that really work? Mary's position belongs to me. Bring it on! Hello? Sorry... Hello? Hello? Sue, can you hear me? Sue, I have good news for you. You're going to have your own show! Did I pass the probation period? Boss recommended you to take over Mary's job. Thank you. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Boss. I'll do my best, thank you all. I'll give it my all. Yes! My cell phone. Sue. The client specifically mentioned these two points. It can boost your energy and improve your circulation. Make sure you emphasize these. Here is the comparison chart of shark liver oil and other kinds of fish liver oil. Have a look at the certification. Peter, the description of ingredients is ambiguous. Besides, aren't sharks one of the endangered ocean animals? Where is this coffee from? South Africa? How would I know? See? It doesn't matter as long as it tastes good. What matters is whether the person who made the coffee wanted to make it good or not, right? Don't worry. It's certified in 13 countries. If it's not good stuff, how did it get so many certifications? This is really good fish oil. It can strengthen your immune system. Sue, didn't you try really hard to get Mary's job? Mask on! 5, 4, 3, 2... Hi, I'm Sue, who keeps you in good shape. I'm here to recommend you an awesome supplement, Atlantic Blue Ocean Shark Liver Oil. Boss, if I may ask... Is Sue Chen your cup of tea? I like you too, Mei. Then why does she have her own show and I don't? Because you're the secret weapon. You don't use your secret weapon until the crucial moment comes. Right? Me? Yes, you. I have faith in you. Ladies, do you feel your hands are getting rougher? It's been a long time since your husband held your hand. When your right hand touches your left hand... Oh my god, did I just touch a scouring pad? If you have the same problem, you should never miss what I'm going to show you today. Dishwasher. It's super smart. Every layer has its own level of water jet. It saves water and energy. We're giving you the best deal ever for this super smart dishwasher. - Buy one and get one free! - Only five left. What? Only five left? Mei never lies! If you don't buy it today, no way you can get it tomorrow. So call now! I wonder how Boss encouraged Mei. She's selling the product with her soul. Lively Mixed Vitamin. Diamond Snail Night Cream. Herbal Diet Pills. Atlantic Blue Ocean Shark Liver Oil. Sue's products are doing okay, but not as well as we expected. I think Sue is not passionate enough about the products. Yes, you're doing it in a safe way, but it's not enough to trigger people's desire to purchase. I agree. Not aggressive enough. Sue. What do you think? I... I feel I'm like a pharmacy owner. Besides, I don't like snails. We fought hard to get the authorization to sell these products. Sue, beauty and supplements are your specialties. Of course you have to sell them. I know. Peter, I'm really grateful. - But... - Maybe... we can let Sue try some other products. We have to experiment to know what works best for her. Alright, let's give it a try. That's all for today. Judy, propose a few more kinds of products in the next evaluation meeting. Boss, thank you. You can thank me with outstanding sales performance. I can help you with this, but you'll have to take care of the rest. I know. I promise I won't let you down. Deal. Good morning, Sue. - Good morning. - Good morning, Sue. Good morning. iPhome 7? iPhome 7! Can we sell this? Peter. Peter. Sue, this is our new colleague. This is Sue Chen, she specializes in beauty products. Sue, Rose will be your partner today. Take care of her and make sure you go through the script together. Hi, senior. My name is Rose. iPhome 7? Can we sell this? This is a fake iPhone. This is a scam, right? Mask on! If you're too idealistic, you can't sell anything. Every product has its consumer group. We are here to create demand. Sales are like performance. You're right, senior! I'll learn as much as I can from you. Hello, everyone. I'm your 3C buddy, Sue. Hi, I'm Rose. We're here to show you the latest smartphone model, iPhome 7! So cool. I know that Apple only launched up to iPhone 6S. What the hell are you saying? That means iPhome 7 is a commercial secret exclusively revealed here. You can get it nowhere else on earth. But iPhone is spelled with an "N," not an "M." What's wrong with you? How boring if you have an iPhone 7 just like everyone else when it's launched? iPhome 7 is only available for those who're watching the show now. Your phone will be the one and only. So special. But the apple on iPhone has only one bite, not two. Are you nuts? Only good apples will make you want to have one more bite, right? I'd like to know how many bites we'll get from our audiences. Call our hotline now. I'll kick you out! "Good Buy TV Shopping" Are these figures for real? So this nonsense works? You're good. You're damn good! Mister, your wife is tough. I was trying to screw her up but she managed to fix it all. I need more time. You don't need time. You did such a great job. We got the first phone call in no time. Even I was so tempted to call from the control room. This is an unprecedented sales style on shopping channels. You've got a really special and unique approach. Since it works so well... You'll pair up and host the show together from now on. Okay? Do your best. Give it your all! "On air" Hello, everyone. I am Sue. I'll make you the most attractive person today. Hi, I'm Rose. Today, I will introduce you our Lucky Meteorite. It looks like nothing but a rock. That's right, it looks like nothing but a rock. - But don't judge a rock by its look. - Really?

Good Fortune Purple Crystal will increase your odds of winning the jackpot by 10%. Korean plastic surgery set menu options. Lee Min-ho and Kim Soo-hyun, which one do you want to become? How can I become Lee Min-ho or Kim Soo-hyun? Why don't you just send me to my next life? You bet. Then I'll check with MD to see if we have a medium package, so that I can visit you in the underworld. What have I done wrong to make you treat me like this? Why are you so bitter? I just want you to be a better man. Right, I'm not good enough. You're too good for me. Do you sell time machines? I want to go back to the past and beat me up for being silly enough to even like you! Why do you talk like this? I meant well. Of course you meant well. Selling wonderful shit to others, turning trash into treasure. You're all angels. Kai Fang. Don't talk shit about my work. Didn't you say you'd be here for me whatever I do? Sue Chen, what you want is the support from Lee Min-ho or Kim Soo-hyun, not from Kai Fang. Since she loves the job so much, I can only try to get used to it or leave her. I shouldn't have forced her. Do you want to divorce her? I don't know. You don't have to go out of your way to help me. You're making good money from your job. Soon you'll be able to pay off your debt. I don't give a damn about that kind of money. Mister, don't worry. Give me some more time. I promise I'll make her change her mind. Cheers! I want to thank you for your contribution to the company. I'm just doing my job. Besides, if you didn't give me a chance, I might not have been able to work here. Thank you, boss, for making my dreams come true. The duck breast is very tender and well-flavored. The ingredients are freshly imported from France. I told the chef to prepare dishes made of the best ingredients for my most important guest. The sauce is unique too. It's the chef's secret recipe. You have a good palate. Do you like to cook? Usually it's my hu... Sue Chen, answer the phone... "Hubby" Sue Chen, answer the phone... Excuse me. I only cook if I have time. But if I have time, I choose to clean the house. I thought so. You're a neat freak! If I see hair on the floor, water stain, used staple, and fingerprint on glass and metal... I can't stand it at all! I need to clean it up right away. Me too! No wonder I always feel we're pretty in-sync. By the way, if you like cleaning, do you know that D-Brand just launched the latest model. 360 Eye... Robot. Gosh! That's every housewife... Every girl's dream product. It's completely out of stock in Europe. - It's something money can't buy. - I have one at my place. How do you like it? I wish I had one too. Do you want to try it? Do you live with your family? No. I live here alone. You're welcome to visit. Anytime. "Hubby: It's getting cold." "Call me if you want me to pick you up." "P.S. The insole is good." "Shaper boxer is so tight." Come on in. - I... - What's wrong? I need to go. Bye. "Good Buy TV Shopping" I think the opening needs to be changed. Right, and... Hi. Did I do something wrong? No. It was not you, boss. Excuse me, I need to go. Sue. We're launching a limited edition diamond next week. Do you want to give it a try? Does it have anything to do with the dinner we had together? Mei will be selling another product of the same price at the same time. What do you think? Thank you, boss. I'll give it my all. Isn't she beautiful? Do you like it? So beautiful. Very beautiful, right? I'm so nervous about walking the red carpet soon. My face is in pain for smiling too much. I can't stand this kind of wealth-flaunting wedding. Hi there. Long time no see. Thank you for coming early. Congratulations! What's wrong? You're right. Cute guys are either playboys or gay. Sue! Where are you going? Hey, you. Why haven't you bought a makeup remover? Do your best! Go! Go! Go! Shouldn't you have been back to the underworld long ago? Why are you still here to scare people? What the heck are you doing? Aren't you selling the diamond ring today? What's that on your face? Get up. Get up! Come with me. Close the door. Sit down. Sue Chen. Look at yourself. Do you think you're selling columbarium niche today? So you never remove your makeup? You're so brave. Look at your blackheads and acnes. You're lucky that you're not selling face steamers today. Otherwise, how do you call yourself a professional? Are you convincing at all? Look, your eyelashes have fallen out. What? What now? Why are you crying? Senior, have you ever lost yourself? I can barely recognize myself. I have no idea what I'm doing. Only pretty faces like you would have such worry. You know, if you have nothing but a pretty face, it won't work. You need to have inner beauty. You've got nothing inside. I don't want to work in sales anymore. It's good that you know your limitations. However, you happened to outperform me by a tiny bit last week. If you quit now, hey, people will laugh at me forever. They'd say that I lost to Sue Chen. What do you think? Do you want to run away? Do you? You can. But you can't run away before I outperform you. Otherwise, I'll break you in two. So? What? What's so funny? If so, I can never leave this place. What are you saying? Do you think you're in luck every day? I bet... you won't be able to sell one single diamond ring today. We'll remove this table. There will be a display stand. Camera 1 will have close-ups for both sides. You have to open it slowly like this. Make sure you stay here longer. - Okay. - Any questions? I don't think so. I'll perk it up right away. - Awesome! - I'll leave it to you. Your mic is a bit off. I see. Thank you. Please say something into the mic, both of you. Excuse me. How strange. 1, 2, 3. Sue. Today is a big day. We are counting on you. You seem to be in good condition. Happy marriage. - One, two, three. Audio, okay? - Is it okay? 3 seconds to the show. 3, 2. Dear friends, you know what I've got for you today? The Ferrari of bike! Domestiques' favorite, the world's fastest triathlon bike. 5, 4, 3, 2. Diamonds are forever. You must have heard this before. I'm Sue. I can ring your bell of happiness. Clap! Today, we're here to show you... - What is Rose doing? - The shiny... - Rose! - ...everlasting... Take off your sunglasses! What now? You don't like your eye makeup? Cut it out! Hold on, hold on. I know this is live. But I've never seen Rose like this, I have to ask her what happened. My destiny is like a revolving lantern. My love life is full of potholes. Seeing this product before the show started made me so sad and cry so hard. So sorry for making your love life full of potholes. I'll make it up with my whole life. Control freak. Ladies, have you ever been heartbroken because of love just like Rose? Guys, men shouldn't make women cry. Today is the day for all of us to witness true love. I'm proud to bring you the Taiwan exclusive launch of the 1 carat diamond ring of hearts and arrows, incomparable beauty from South Africa. It's right here, in front of your eyes now. What the hell? They were just acting. Old man, look at how well Sue acts. Whichever side of the ring I'm showing you... No... What happened? Are they still acting? I don't know. Let me switch off the intercom. Play the video clip! Ask Boss to come to the Control Room. Are you feeling better? That was scary. Don't move. I placed a bomb on your mini mic. If I accidentally press this button, it'll explode. What's this? This is not what we have rehearsed! Do as I say. Otherwise, Sue Chen will be blown up in two. Camera 2 stays. The rest of you, out. All of you. Go out. You two, thank you for playing the guards. Off you go. Go get your meal box. Close the door! Kui, the studio is... - Rose... - What are they doing? Are they acting? Really? Yes! I just... Sue, Rose, are you still acting? No sudden moves, please. If I get nervous, I might just press it. The rest of the show has to go on according to my command, or I'll detonate the bomb right away. Is that clear? It seems like they're not acting. Call the police. Okay, call the police. Hold on, don't call the police. If this gets out, it'll damage the company's image... Ask Rose what they want. When the video clip is finished, cut back to the live show, but we'll change the product we sell today to something else. Let me tell you, once I've been on this bike, I'll never get on another one. Call in now! Maybe you can still grab one. - Call now. - Come on. Okay. Play the video clip. We'll be back in 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Thanks, Liang. How's it going? We're getting more deals than that longlegs, right? I'm not sure. Something's happened in Studio B and they asked Boss to go there. Boss wants you to play pre-recorded videos and leave all products to Chou for now. Why? I'm doing well, why should I leave them? - No, well... - Tell me why! Mei. Sue is kidnapped. - Kid... - I saw Rose, she was just... You salespeople are all evasive. You only mentioned the pros not the cons. - What are you selling? - What's going on? - An illusion, a fantasy. - Senior, this is bad. - Dear audience... - What's happening? ...do you really believe that shopping will change your life? Your life will be improved because of the money you spend? A soy milk maker makes you healthy. A fat-burning tea makes you slim. A shapewear makes you sexy. A diamond makes your love last forever. Bullshit! Let me tell you, even if a fake one is priced 100 thousand, you'd still pay for it. Idiot. What story is this? It must be Sue's script. - What's going on? - Really? Rose, you seem to have deep a hostility towards salespeople. Mom, calm down. I'll be home soon. Mom! A down-to-earth woman, - who worked all her life... - Mom! - ...who managed to save her pension... - Mom! ...had her savings swindled by a heartless salesperson, who left her a great deal of debt and junk. All my life, what I detest most is irresponsible salespeople. They know the products are useless but still promote them as rare treasures, just to make money. It doesn't mean all salespeople are like that. You... Come here. Here. Sit down. Why don't you try selling yourself today, right here? What? Use your signature sales skills and tell the audience what your value is. Since you're the most trustworthy, responsible and eloquent shopping host, why don't you just sell yourself here? What's our goal today? A limited number of 10 pieces? Great. We'll let people call in and see if you can get 10 audiences to buy Sue Chen for the same price as the diamond ring. If there are less than 10 orders, I want her to quit. Since you have such a glib tongue, it shouldn't be hard to get 10 orders, right? Shall we call in to save Sue? - Who wants to buy her? - Idiot, what's the point of buying her? Really? Is the bomb real or fake? Bomb! Does anyone call the police? It sucks. Are there still people watching this channel? Nuts! Turn it off! Breaking news. Famous TV shopping host, Sue Chen, is held hostage by a female co-host - in the live show this evening. - ...taken hostage by her co-host. Top management of the shopping channel hasn't confirmed it. According to an anonymous inside sources, the suspect threatened Sue Chen with a bomb and asked people to call in on the live show to see if they can get 10 audiences to buy Sue Chen at the same price as the original product. Situations in the studio remain unclear. We don't know if it happened due to work-related disputes or personal reasons. We'll keep you updated... I'm actually quite shy. I'm ordinary, introverted, and I don't know how to talk to strangers. I somehow finished high school... Hold on. We're not here to go through the flashback of your life. Let me remind you, if the number of deals remains zero, you might soon be able to see the flashback of your life. On my first day as a salesperson, I got zero deal. The first deal I got in my life, was three packs of frozen food bought by my mom. Plus two bottles of makeup removing cleaning mousse. I'm telling you this because I want you to know, I have never been a talented salesperson, but in order to become one, I've worked really hard. I almost had a tear in my eyes. However, it seems like your audience have not been moved yet. Hey, Miss Rose. I beg you. I'll give you as much money as you want. Please don't harm my daughter. Miss Rose, I'll give you all my savings. Please don't harm my daughter. From now on, this number is your personal hotline. - Don't hurt my daughter. - Mom. Please, I beg you. Sue! You said you don't want to be disposable anymore. I'll buy you with my salary of the month and all my savings. Don't give up! You have to make all those who despise you drop their jaws! Sue! I was such a chicken shit. I did you wrong and fired you. There is no other hardworking talent like you in the world! I'm in! Hey, Sue! I've got your back. Don't worry. If you're fired, come back and work for me. You're such a hardworking and miraculous sales talent. I'll pay you well! Count me in! So touching. But... 5 more to go. Because I don't want to be disposable... I don't want to be belittled anymore. When pursuing success, I might have been... too harsh to some people and hurt them. Maybe this is the punishment I deserve. To leave this place. Sue! You have no right to be discouraged. Before I outperform you, before you admit defeat to me, don't you think about leaving. You'll always be my nemesis. Do you hear? Count me in! Sue, I'm in too! Although you're like that, you're a really ethical shopping host. I'm in too! Sue, there's no way you're harsher than me. Now you're the ace of our company, don't you dare leaving just like this! I'm in! Kui. - Who the hell are they? - They... I'm Rose's man. Let me talk to her. Amazing! I can't believe you've got 8 deals already. How about sharing more stories? Come on! Sue. I want to apologize. As your boss, I should've behaved when being with you. I shouldn't have played with your heart and confused you. Please forgive me and stay. Was that our boss, Sean? Sean Shao, you bastard asshole! I want a divorce! How much time have we got? Less than 5 minutes. Who hasn't called yet? Call now! I think the call we just got doesn't count. But this Sean... Mr. Shao, you should think about what you've done. It's me who should. I want to apologize to someone who is my biggest support. I never thought I was anything special until I met you. You're always there for me, cheering me up, telling me that I am the best. It's your sweetness that filled our everyday lives with love. Thank you. Honey. I'm sorry. In order to be successful, I lost myself. I've become the kind of person I dislike the most. I've become the kind of person I detest the most. I'm sorry. What a tear-jerking moment. Even I feel like crying now. Senior, your husband must be very happy to hear that. But now, the question is, where is the tenth phone call? We can't find one more person who recognizes Sue Chen's value? Is this the end of Sue Chen's TV shopping host career? Rose, I know you really want to get rid of me. I was obsessed with gambling and drinking. Master? It was my fault that I failed to help you when you needed me the most. You know each other? But you've always been on my mind. Jack! I don't hate you for stealing my money and running away. Get lost! I don't hate you for leaving tons of direct-selling products to me. It's okay if you hate me, but it's time for you to stop. I said go away! There are so many precious memories between us which will never die. I'm searching. Searching for the window that Cupid has opened. Shut up! A window to the future of the gangsters, and the hope for the gropers. Shut up! I'm not listening... If you know where it is, please let me know. I know! Sue doesn't need others to determine her value. I know how hard she works better than anyone else in the world. I don't know anyone who believes in her dreams more than my wife does. What's wrong with that? If you get to see her hard work and efforts like me, you'll see that she deserves everything she has now. Honey, Cupid opened the window for us, and I won't close it. I'll buy whatever is needed to hit your sales target. That's right! The love between me and my husband is rock solid, just like this diamond of hearts and arrows. What are you waiting for? Call in now! What are you doing? 3, 2, 1. Cut. I knew you can make it, Sue Chen! "Resignation Letter" Are you sure you want to leave? You're our ace now. Mei is the real ace, not me. If you change your mind, you're always welcome to come back. Thank you, boss. My name is Sue Chen, Sue as in superwoman. Diligence is my middle name. But now, I just want to live an ordinary life. The paper edge is curled! Come on. We've been frontline salespeople for so long. The interview will be just a piece of cake. That's why we should ask for higher pay. Besides, everybody shops online now. Top management should feel lucky that experienced people like us are willing to stay at shopping channels. "Good Buy TV Shopping" Prada, take a closer shot.
