- The time has come to make our move. I am ready to take over the country. But first I must get rid of the king and his daughter, Princess Oneeba. They are now at the Rwanda oil fields visiting with the American pig, Maney, the brother of Solomon King. You will launch an attack on the oil fields immediately. Do you understand? The king and the princess should be killed, killed, killed, immediately! Understand? Killed? - I hear and obey, oh mighty Prince Hassan. - Now that well there was thought to be dry. We're getting 700 barrels a day from it now. Since you gave me and my brother the oil concession, we've increased production 60%. - [Princess Oneeba] Why couldn't Prince Hassan get these kind of results when he had the oil concession? - [Maney] Well, I'll put it like this, Princess Oneeba, I think Hassan is putting the profit in his pocket as soon as we get it out of the ground. (guns fire) Get outta here! Get outta here! They're shooting us! (telephone ringing) - Hello? - [Maney] Hello, this is Maney. - Who? - [Maney] Maney, this is Manny! All hell's breaking loose! Where's Solomon? - Oh, Maney. - Yeah, Maney. This is Maney. Let me talk to Solomon. Where's Solomon? - Well, Solomon isn't here. - [Maney] Where is he? Albert, let me talk to Solomon. Solomon, this is Maney. (guns firing) - Maney? Maney? (bombs explode) (bullets ricocheting) (guns fire) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (funk music) (telephone ringing) - [Agent Winestock] Agent Winestock. - [Prince Hassan] Winestock, this is Prince Hassan. Listen carefully. I've taken control of the country, but my uncle King Hassan and his daughter, Princess Oneeba has slipped through our grasp. The king is somewhere here in Rwanda and will eventually be found by my men and disposed of. Princess Oneeba has left the country with the brother of Solomon King and is right now on an airplane headed for the United States. I want her found and killed. - [Agent Winestock] God dammit Hassan. It's one thing to send someone to your country to knock a few people off to help you get in power. But if I start killing people here in the states, there's gonna be trouble. We're under investigation now just for keeping files on a few bastards. If the department finds out I'm working for you... - [Prince Hassan] Listen Winestock, you CIA son of a bitch. I pay you good money to take care of my interest over there. I want her dead. Now you get someone to stick close to Solomon King and find the princess... - [Agent Winestock] But... - [Prince Hassan] You do it Winestock or I'll feed your balls to the pigs. - [Agent Winestock] Okay, okay. O'Malley has already called Solomon King. So he'll probably be in the office soon. I'll be there when he comes in. In the meantime, I'll put a couple of boys on his trail. (traffic noises) - Keep a look out. That nigger is pretty tricky. - What the hell you guys doing following me? Next time I catch him I'm gonna blow your damn head off. - That's far out tomodachi, there's two people watching us across the street. Do it, do it now. - Next time I catch you following me, I will blow your damn head off. - Well, whatever turns you on. - Now get the hell outta here. (tires screech) (telephone buzzes) -Yes? Solomon King? Yeah, send him in. - Who's Solomon King? - He used to be with my department before you got here. Sorry to see him go. - Oh, that's that nigger you're always talking about. - Yeah, one smart nigger. (door opens) - Okay, man. Now tell me what's going on. I got a call from you and one call from my brother. - Well, the information that I wanted to give you was that Maney and Princess Oneeba are safe. They should be on their way back to this country right now. King, I need your help. You spent a good many years over there and we know that Hassan has started his revolution. - Hassan? I know he's chicken shit enough to do something like this, but he don't have the money to back himself on nothing like this. It's gotta be somebody bigger than him. - Well, that's why I need your help. You know the people in the country and besides King, you all have oil interest over there. - It don't have to be coming from over there, you know. It could be coming from right here. It could be a political thing. - Well, our reports show that Hassan is the leader. - Well, O'Malley, until I talk to my brother, I don't wanna discuss this thing. - King. Keep in touch. (door opens) (door closes) (airplane whirring) - [Air Traffic Controller] International 221, this is Los Angeles central. You were cleared for runway 25 left 67. - [Pilot] Rwanda 221, roger. - [Solomon King] Maney, what in the hell is going on? - [Maney] I think Hassan has finally made his move to take over. He's blown up a lot of oil wells and tried to kill me and the princess. I don't think he's gonna stop just because we brought the princess to the United States. - [Princess Oneeba] Solomon, do you think Prince Hassan would try anything over here? - [Solomon King] I wouldn't put nothing past Hassan. - Man, it sure is good to be back home after all the shit we've been through. (crickets chirping) - [Princess Oneeba] Oh, Solomon. What a perfectly beautiful view you have here. - Beautiful view. Say, you two can stand here and look at the view if that's what you want to do, but I'm gonna have Albert to drop me off over to Uncle John's so I can get me some rest. Is that cool with you? - [Princess Oneeba] So pretty here. - [Solomon King] My, you sure has grown. Are you cold? - [Princess Oneeba] I'm cold. - [Solomon King] You have any clothes? - [Princess Oneeba] Just what I have on. - [Solomon King] Well, we'll have Albert to get you some clothes tomorrow. Okay? - [Princess Oneeba] Okay. - [Solomon King] I think you should go to bed too. - [Princess Oneeba] Okay. (slow jazzy music) - I brought you some presents. - Oh... (presents falling) Ah! You didn't have to... Anything pretty? What should I open first? - Why don't you open this one? - This one, okay. - Hurry, hurry. - Are you ready? Oh! - Isn't it beautiful? - Oh, it is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. What do you think? Huh? Will it fit? - Yeah! I thought you'd like it. - Albert, did you get my keys? - Oh, I left them in the car. I'll get 'em for you. - It's all right. - Okay. - Solomon? Thank you. - See you guys. - Okay. Albert? - Yeah? What is it? - Are you in love with Solomon? - Me? In love with Solomon, are you kidding? No! - [Solomon King] Look, man. I'm not gonna stand by and see friends of mine killed and do nothing about it. - [O'Malley] It's not up to you to do anything about it. It's up to the proper authorities. The channel, the CIA states must function outside of this country. - I intend to function and function well on anybody that tries to kill the princess. - Around laws that must be obeyed, Solomon. - There's a higher law. The law of survival. The princess is my responsibility and I intend to protect her by any mean necessary. - Where is the princess now? - Just outside the park with Maney and Uncle John. - Well, I guess she's safe enough for the moment, but if you're gonna follow through with this Solomon at least take your credentials back. It'll help a lot if this thing gets thick and it looks as if it might. - If I need the help from the CIA, you would be the first one I'd call O'Malley. For the time being, I just want to keep the princess safe. (birds chirping) - Okay, Solomon. You let me know if you need anything. I'll be at the office. - Yeah, you take it easy. (footsteps approaching) (tense music) - Get out the car. - Hey, Uncle John, just do like they say. It'll be all right. - Cut the fucking talking and get out of the goddamn car. (funk music) (men scuffling) (punching noises) - Let me go, let me go! (indistinct) (footsteps approaching) (car engine revving) - [Prince Hassan] Winestock. I'm sending you a trained assassin to do what your CIA thugs obviously cannot. You will meet him in an outdoor restaurant frequented by my countryman. He will receive from you an envelope containing the whereabouts of Princess Oneeba and the movements of Solomon King. You will utter a code word to which he will answer. That is all. There will be no need for directed conversation. - Check mate. - It's the black man's move. (romantic bluesy music) - What are you looking at? Do I look funny? I didn't have time to pack, you know? - [Solomon King] Well, tell me about your one suitcase and your 10 maids. - I didn't have time to bring them. Solomon, I didn't have time to do anything at all. I was so, I was so confused. I just knew I had to leave. Remember when you came to our country and, and you helped my father. He gave you all the oil and all that land and, and most of all, his trust. Everything's happening all over again. It's crazy, I don't understand. My cousin Hassan... I think he's making a deal with some people in America. If they put him on the throne, he'll give them the oil from our country. It's so crazy. - [Solomon King] Sounds like a bad dream. - [Princess Oneeba] I know. Only it's real. The most frightening part about it is in order for, in order for him to succeed, he's gotta have both my father and myself killed. He's put up such horrible propaganda about the family, old friends and, and loyal citizens are starting to believe it. Solomon, I'm frightened. (funk music) (birds chirping) (mechanical whirring) (birds chirping) (mechanical whirring) (mechanical clanking) (tense funk music) (mechanical whirring) - What's going, on little mama? - I'm making breakfast for you. - Oh. - It's not ready yet. - You can cut this off here. You cooking... pancakes and toast too? Mmmm. Take this off. - It's horrible. - All right, all right. Hey, hey. (Princess Oneeba crying) It's okay. (Princess Oneeba blubbering) Look here. Look here. You see this thing here? You see this thing right here? That's um, pork. That stuff can kill you. And those eggs you was eating, we ate the chicken two months ago. - [Solomon King] Hey, get some stuff together. We'll go to the beach and forget all about that breakfast. (birds chirping) (garage door opening) (car engine revving) (funk music) (car engine revving) - [Princess Oneeba] Solomon? Would you teach me how to drive your car? - [Solomon King] Well, hmm... Okay, later. (car engine revving) (tense funk music) (seagulls squawking) (waves crashing) (seagulls squawking) - Come on, get down here. - Woo! (Princess Oneeba laughing) - Solomon. Is it true what they say about sea shells? Can you really hear the ocean in a sea shell? - Well, you can see it too. Why don't you go down and look at one? - Well, all right. - Watch out for that water! (tense funk music) (seagulls squawking) (waves crashing) (waves crashing) (waves crashing) (Solomon whistles) (tense funk music) - We gotta go. - Why? Do we have to leave right now? - You gotta promise me that you won't go outside of the house without me or Maney. Okay? - Okay, Solomon. But why? - I'll explain it to you later. Let's get outta here. - Okay. (tense funk music) (waves crashing) (romantic bluesy music) - Can I fix you something to drink? - No. - Would you like something to eat from the kitchen? - Nope. - How would you like me to fix you a nice warm bath? - Nope. - Do you think I'm as pretty as this girl? - Nope. - What? - Oh. Oh yeah. (magazine pages crinkling) - You think I am pretty at all? - Oh yeah. - Solomon. -Yes? - Would you like it if I stayed here forever and ever and ever? - Mm-hmm. - Would you like me to shut up? - Mm-hmm. Oh no. Keep talking. (romantic bluesy music) - I'm not bothering you, am I? A little bit? - No. - Why not? You have to work all the time. Why don't you do something else for a change? - Like what? - I don't know. Why do you ask me? You're the man. You should think of these things. Maybe. Maybe. (laughter) (Princess Oneeba squeals) (romantic bluesy music) - Shall we? - Hmm? - Let's go into the bedroom. - There's more room on the floor. (romantic bluesy music) (tense funk music) - Say, man, what in the hell are you gonna do? We've been here for a while now and you ain't done a damn thing while Hassan is gaining more control of all our oil rights. Now what in the hell are you going to do? What do you think the princess and I came here for? A social visit, man? - [Solomon King] Hey, lighten up little brother. I'm aware of what's going on. And I have the situation well under control. - [Maney] Under control? If you had everything under control, man, then you would know about the Hunkies recruiting black brothers at the Sugar Hill club to go and join Hassan's army. - [Solomon King] Who told you this? - [Maney] Uncle John told me. And by the way, he also told me he haven't saw you in a couple of weeks. - [Solomon King] I tell you what we do. We run back by the house, see how Princess Oneeba is doing. And then we run by Uncle John's house. - [Maney] Hey man, whatever you say is cool with me. (funk music) (car engine idling) (door opens) (funk music) (door closes) (door opens) (door closes) (funk music) (funk music) (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (funk music) (birds chirping) (funk music) (birds chirping) - [Solomon King] Oneeba? Where in the hell is she? Oneeba? I thought you promised me that you were gonna stay inside. (gun fires) (tires screech) - [Maney] Oh my God. (jazz music) (waves crashing) - [Princess Oneeba] Oh, Solomon. I love you. (jazz music) - [Prince Hassan] Yes, what is it? - Princess Oneeba is dead now. - Good. And the king? - The king is alive, but he will not be alive for long. - Excellent. Excellent. - [Club Announcer] We having fun here, sister Sheila plays tonight.

What you all doing about it? - No I don't. But I've given this case top priority. - Top priority, bullshit. What does that mean? - That means I'm putting every available man on duty. - Say, O'Malley, I don't trust you. I don't trust no one in the CIA department. - You gotta trust somebody. - If you can't handle it, my brother and I can. - Maney, let me tell you something. If you and King get involved, I can't help you. This is government business. - Government business. Bullshit. - [Solomon King] Why at this club these whities supposed to be recruiting black brothers for Hassan's army? - [Maney] The Sugar Hill club. - [King Solomon] Why don't you get Charlie on the phone and tell him to bring a couple of guys with him and tell to meet us down there. - [Maney] Right on. (funk music) - I promise you that you'll be well paid for your services. The money is damn good. - So man, when you talking about money, you talking about the whole club? - Is this your whole club? - Yeah. - Yeah. - This is your whole club. - All of it. - Well, you've heard about the oil crisis, haven't you? - Right on. - It's bringing a bundle right now. - Don't you suckers know that the days of Uncle Remus and old black Joe is gone? - Man, (indistinct) he all right. - If you keep on this course, you and uncle Remus are going to be partners in heaven. - Listen, man. Oh, listen. - Because it don't send fools to hell. Unfortunately this has been a trend of niggas like you for the last hundred years. You always underestimate yourself. You can't do a thing without the white man calling the motherfucking shots. - Hold it, hold it. - You touch me one, I'm gonna more push upside your motherfucking head. You hear me? - You worry about it. Get off me. - Now, if you standing up for this hunky for something, you gonna lay down for me for nothing. Didn't I tell you to keep your damn hands off of me. (men scuffling) (guns fire) (machine gun firing) (funk music) - You know, some people just don't listen to a damn thing you tell 'em. (doorbell rings) - Solomon. How you doing? - Okay. - Good, good. I'm surprised that you're looking so good, man. I'm telling you the truth. If you look like you've been eating your (indistinct) or gravy train or something. Come on in, man. I wanna talk to you. I got some talk for you. Come on in. I want to talk with you, man. Come on, sit down, sit down. I don't have to ask you how you've been doing because I know. I've been hearing all about it. Listen, let me tell you something fella. You cannot go around here shooting up bars and killing people like you trying to send newspapers up to a dollar and a half or something. Man, look. Let me tell you this. Now, if you want to do something about Oneeba's murder... Let me tell you something. You better get back over here and try to sit down and listen to me with your gold smellin' ass. Look, let me tell you. I've been trying to get you to go back and see O'Malley and get your credentials back. - Wait, wait, wait, wait a fucking minute. Those sons of bitches didn't have no credentials when they shot Oneeba. - Look, if you kill somebody without your credentials, you're gonna spend 99 years and one black son in the clinks. Is this what the hell you're trying to do? Go and get your credentials from O'Malley and damn make sure when you go see O'Malley, there's nobody in the office but you and him. See, there's been some leaks coming out of that office and it's not O'Malley. Now you worked for him for five years and you know damn well he's an ex-service man and he goes strictly by the books. Look, the dude is in your corner, man. And he's already covered up for the shit that you pulled. - Well, I'll think about it. - Look. Think my ass. Let me tell you something. You know, I've always told you as long as you live and ass your pinned to the ground, when you lose your head, your ass goes with it. (phone ringing) - Hello? Officer Miller. (coughing) Yes, sir.

Oh, left over from a job, you know, but old horse shit O'Malley it'll probably come off a little while. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't need to ask you how you're doing. I walked through your club out there. Really nice. - Yeah it's something else. Huh? - It's good to see you again man. - Yeah, you too. - Yeah. Say, well... - How long did we work together? - At least five years. - Five years? - Yeah.

But what, what y'all gonna do too, when you find it? - We just gonna talk to him real. - Don't do like that to me when y'all come busting in with pistols, man.

He's the one that's responsible for bagging all of Hassan's revolution. Hassan still has control of the country. - But what you gonna do about Hassan? - King, since you know the country so well over there, I suggest you get some of your old Green Beret buddies. - You talking about, uh... - That's right. - Come on, Boogie!
