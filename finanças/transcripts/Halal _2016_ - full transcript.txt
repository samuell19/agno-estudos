Mother Father. Brother-in-law is coming What did you say? Brother-in-law has come Why has he come after everything is over? What does he belong here now? Is he not satisfied ruining our lives? I’m warning you. Do not take him in Now, we don’t share any relation with him And yes, if he says anything wrong then I will break his jaw I’m warning you Salutations! Salutations! Sit Brother-in-law, shall I give you water? Hmm Take it What brings you here? Is Halim there? - Hmm.. I wanted to speak to you something important Tell me I’ve come to take her away You can’t take your wife back after the 'talaq'(divorce) Don't you know? I know But this is not the procedure of divorce in our religion, right? We can't divorce our partner all of a sudden Even if we want to, it takes three months We need to say 'Talaq' every month That too in presence of the few jury members of the society Also need to return the token amount taken during the marriage I haven't done anything of that sort So as per the religious practice, we are still married In that case, why did you let my daughter stay here for 2 years? You know my condition I couldn't say anything to mother That time my mother was alive What? When did this happen? - Six months passed Why didn't you inform us? - Yes Hatred is kept aside during bad times We would have at least come for the last rites Leave it If I had come soon after mother's death it wouldn't look good That's why I have come now It would be better if he had died earlier Let it be, son-in-law You must not use bad words for the dead Let bygone be bygone Okay See you I want to settle down with Halim again Let me know your decision I will come on next Friday Bye Bye "God is great." Hey! Do you listen to me? Will smoking solve the problem? What do we do now? Don't make noise We should think of our daughter's betterment It's no use digging the past Son-in-law has personally come to take her away. So let her go Even her mother-in-law is no more. She will live happily Sister. Sister What happened? Nothing. - Eat something Eat If you love her so much, why did you leave her then? Because of my mother. Mother had made her life hell With the daybreak, mother would attack on her with her abusive language Everyone starts working from early morning But she's sitting idle over here My bad luck Idiot, are you dead? Huh? Can't you work in speed? Will you take so much time making a cup of tea? Do you hear me, you idiot? Yes, mother, I'm giving you. - Get it, fast She had to marry my son only. My bad luck Give it Are you going, son? - Yes Take your lunch box Hey, lazy girl, did you pack his lunch box? Has he married you for making you rest? Will you let my son starve? Hey, do you hear me? Can't do a single job properly. She makes her husband starve and keeps eating the entire day. Gobbler He has left now. Are you blind? Lazy Every chores is late Now will you keep me starving So, what you wanted has happened, right? When will you get rid of this sin? Idiot Are you brought here for praising you all the time? Or will your mother come and do these chores? Now, you will also starve the entire day I will break your bones if you eat even a morsel Don't cry, Halim I can understand everything but what do I do? After all, she's my mother I tried to explain her a lot of time But everyone's nature is different. What can we do in this? Don't take her words seriously Come. Let's eat Don't vent your anger on food Come on See, even I won't eat if you wouldn't eat Come Halim Halim Halim Yes Bring water. - Yes, I will Hurry up Halim I will bring it. - Are you deaf? Have you died or what? Coming I'm calling out to you from such a long time Can't you hear? What did you put in the water? Want to kill me? Are you blind? - What have I done? Will you argue with me? Will you? Let me show you now Tell her to die You will kill her if she stays here Nothing doing. Now, I will end this matter Halim. Our relation is over now I'm divorcing you. 'Talaq'. 'Talaq'. 'Talaq' Yes, defame me in the village Make a scene of me in the village My son's life is ruined because of you Go, don't come back. You proved me bad in the society Let's go. - You proved me wrong How will you pay this sin Don't cry Come here Come, sit here Sit Don't cry I'm not angry on you You know that it is my mistake But nothing is in my control I'm not even thinking of divorcing you But I can't drive away my mother from the house People will spit on me if I do that They will say that I've driven away mother for my wife If I drive you away they will praise me that I've driven out my wife for my mother See, if I really let you stay with me she will kill you one day Instead, you go home You're fine there Hey.. but I want to stay with you She will kill you if you stay here. So what do I do now? You think I don't want you in my life? But if you stay here, I don't want to take the sin of killing you Come Come with me Come Come But now my mother is no more Now, I there's no problem if I bring her back Even I can't live without her She's my wife 2 years are more than enough. - Yeah With the daybreak this man starts smoking No financial support at all from his side How long I can run everything alone? We have three daughters But this man is least bothered Things are getting difficult to settle one daughter Wonder what future has in store What will happen? God is there He will do good Yes, God has heard our prayers. Sister's mother-in-law died Now, the king and the queen will be all alone at home Is that so? Hey, sister will take me along and not you Isn't it? - Yes, I will take you along Take her. My burden will reduce I will go with sister. She won't take you Get away Halim can't go back What? What did you say? We can't send Halim back This practice is not followed in our religion Don't talk nonsense. Are you mad? Son-in-law had personally come to take her away Why can't we send her? I've never seen this in my life that one can take back his divorced wife This practice is not there in our religion But.. - A divorcee can marry another man But she can't return to her first husband I know this for sure But son-in-law said that even Quran doesn't accept divorce given in anger And he also didn't return the token amount Without returning the token amount divorce is not legal What does he know? As if you know everything As if you live life on God's saying I'm telling you as much as I know I've never seen a husband who has returned the token amount No one does this, these days Once divorced, woman returns home And rots all her life or remarries And it is difficult to get a husband second time But a man does second marriage And he even marries an unmarried girl Men after all, are a sly Even if we wish to send her, what will people say? Our society will not accept this Why are you concerned about people's opinion? Son-in-law himself had come to take her away We've two more daughters at home I don't want to ruin their lives for one daughter What a life! Its worst than a dog Then what should we do now? I don't know that I will consult our priest He will suggest a solution You don't worry We are going to meet priest Salutations! We will ask him. Will find some way Salutations! Salutations! Salutations! - Salutations! Come, sit. Sit Well, we wanted to speak to you about something Yes, tell me You know that Balu's daughter is divorced 2 years ago Balu, what has happened has happened How long will you let her live alone? Find a better match and get her remarried That's why I've come to you Why? What has happened? Balu's son-in-law had come home yesterday He was talking of taking away Halim Is it? - Hmm I've never seen this in my life that a woman has returned to her husband Hmm I've heard about it. But I've never seen in my life This is a totally new matter But Balu, Quran has answers to all the questions in life Of this world as well as the other world But my son-in-law says that the way he divorced her was not legal And he also didn't return the token amount The boy is correct According to the holy Quran, it is illegal to divorce someone like this It is wrong Three month's time is given to divorce anyone Every month, in presence of the jury members one has to declare his divorce But these days, it has become the trend of divorcing wife in this way People don't follow what is said in Hadith They twist and turn it as their requirement If your son-in-law knew this then why did he divorce her in this way? He said he was angry at that time And his anger calmed down after divorcing his wife, right? Let bygone be bygone Now you tell me what I should do now Let me tell you, Balu In such a situation, Holy Quran says that.. Halim can't marry Kuddus so easily Meaning? I didn't understand Hadith prescribes a proper tradition to be followed by every Muslims It is called 'Halala' (legitimate) 'Halala' According to this, if your son-in-law wants to take away Halim to his house, he will have to remarry Halim But before that your daughter must marry another man That man can divorce her only after her 'Iddat' (waiting period) is over If she turned out to be pregnant then that man can divorce her only after she gives birth to a child And only after that Kuddus can remarry Halim Doing anything against this rule is illegal.. as per the religious practice Isn't there any other solution to this? No, Balu This rule is made for those men.. who consider women their slave, or use them This rule is made to bring them down to earth Come to me without hesitation if you need any help It's our duty to unite the lovers Kuddus and Halim's marriage will become an example in the village Bye. - Bye "God is great." What rule is this? Son-in-law is ready to take her away But this is something new now It's nothing new. It's mentioned in our religion We must follow it But are you convinced with it? Can't we think of any other solution? It is mentioned in the Quran that is followed everywhere Even the priest said there's no other solution But.. - Don't get on my nerves This is a custom If we want to send our daughter back then we must follow it I had never heard of such a thing. Is it really possible? I also heard it for the first time In our religion, a woman can easily go back to her in-law's house even if she has stayed at her maternal house for 2 or more years And this second marriage in your religion is totally strange This is a rule in our religion. We can't change it This rule is made to punish a husband who leaves woman anytime on his will Now, he must pay for it Tell me one thing. If this rule is made to punish a husband then how's he suffering in this? Woman has to suffer by getting married to another man Hmm Mother, I'm going. Yes God Hello, chief. - Hello. How are you? You seem to be in a hurry today Yes, Balu's daughter's matter needs to be resolved I'm going there. - It's a big problem in a way He should have quietly sent his daughter but started with all this Now, this is a custom in their religion So one must follow it. - Yes And when their priest has said, we can't avoid him. - That's true I will go there, okay? - Yes. Okay God! Vanna, bring some water Feeling very thirsty When is son-in-law coming? How do I know? You've informed everyone else, right? Even they haven't come as yet Why should I call them unless the son-in-law arrives? Why waste on tea? Let the son-in-law come. Then we will call them Salutations. - Salutations Sit Give him water Yes, here Sit, I will come in a moment. Make some tea for him. - Yes Take it. - Take it Okay, son-in-law, it's good if everything is followed as per the customs and religions Right? - Yes I never deny I'm here for that I just want to take Halim back You want to take her away, right? Okay then Follow the religious customs Take her away and live happily Yes, but I didn't understand What do you mean by religious customs? What's the religious custom? Son-in-law, as per the rule if you want to take back Halim then you must marry her again But before that Halim should marry someone else and when he divorces her, you can remarry Halim and live with her Otherwise, you cannot You all know our financial condition I can't afford the second marriage of one daughter Hey! I still have two more daughters Balu, everyone's fate is with him If it is about your daughter's betterment then God is there Why do you worry? You tell us what do we do now What will I say? Whatever son-in-law says I want to take Halim back But don't you think this rule of marrying another man is strange? How can anyone marry off his wife with someone else? Look, son-in-law After you divorced her, now she's not your wife You will divorce a woman anytime you wish to Then what should that woman do? What is her fault? No one should do this in life that's why.. this rule is made in our religion so as to punish the man I didn't know this rule Now, you understood it, right? So, now decide what to do I can't understand these religious rules You can't, right? Then don't worry Rest assured and do as we say Tell me one thing, you love Halim, right? You can do anything for her, right? You want to take her away, right? Then do as I say Let everything happen as per the religious way We will get Halim married to someone temporarily And then we will tell him to divorce her Once, she is divorced we will get you both remarried Then live happily What say? - Yes So, what do you think about this, son-in-law? I need to ask the priest from our village Look, son-in-law Whether it is said by priest of this village or that village The rules mentioned in Quran don't change Every Muslim all over the world has to follow the same rules It doesn't change anywhere. Right? Hmm Let him ask. For his satisfaction Right, son-in-law? Yes, let's go Son-in-law, let me say this as I'm elder to you Now, that you've stepped further don't step back It's lucky to get a wife like Halim Don't desert her now Look, God has made rules for our betterment You love her, right? You want her, right? Then we must follow the rules... The religious customs Besides all of us are there with you. Don't worry And Balu, don't worry about the money Don't let your daughter stay at home for money constraints I'm there. I will help you And you're lucky to get such a good son-in-law Don't let him go. - Yes Everything will happen as per God's wish Okay? See you Bye. - Bye We must help him after all. - Bye Right Who else will otherwise help him? - That's why I was telling Did you ask Halim? What's to ask her? She's a girl. What does she understand in this? She will do what we say Still I think we should ask Halim What do I say? You ask her Halim Halim Halim. Come out What do you think? What should we do? What do I say? Whatever you decide Have you thought over this? I don't understand anything else I just want to live with you Alright then Then even I'm ready You look for a boy And let everything happen as per the religious rules Once he divorces Halim I will remarry her See you Bye Bye So, what is decided, Pasha? About what? Marrying Balu's daughter Are you mad? You're talking anything Why? What happened? You will get such a good wife like Halim for three months You're getting an opportunity and you. So you take this opportunity. Why do you tell me? I already have one. I can't afford to spend after her But you have the options to manage with more than one Think over it You will not have to spend much on her It's so strange! Halim's husband has agreed to marry her off with another man Is he not ashamed? Such different things are happening in our village What's different in this? - It is This is in their religion Religion. But that son-in-law is quite strange He's ready to let her marry another man It is really lucky to get such a husband in this time He loves her a lot That's true. Halim is really lucky It is her 2 years penance May she be blessed! Hope she gets a good husband this time Yes. - Otherwise, if he wouldn't divorce her then.. They will consider this point before marrying her off It's not that. - Then? Halim is beautiful. - Yes And it doesn't take time for a man to change from his word Yes Then I hope she gets a gentleman Amen! Sister What do you think? Will everything be fine? I find it really very strange But brother-in-law loves you a lot He's very good He can do anything for me We can see that Hey.. He had divorced me for my sake only He couldn't see my plight But this rule, your second marriage? Are you ready for all this? Now, I can't see him in pain If he wanted, he would have remarried by now But he didn't do that You're right Now, even your mother-in-law is no more You can live happily with him But I can't understand about this rule Leave it The elderly people are there They will decide Whatever is God's wish Now, go to sleep That's true We can say anything But brother-in-law is a good man I wish you get someone like him again We will find another boy? But marry her with him And then remarry her with son-in-law How will we manage? Our two daughters are yet to be married off How do we arrange for such a big amount? People will help us but how much? And how do we repay them? We haven't repaid the loan taken for Halim's first marriage If we have to go on repaying the loans what do we eat? We will die in this struggle My mind is totally blank now God only knows how many generations will die in this way Wonder why poor has to suffer so much? For which of our sin God is punishing us? What life is this? Just go on working from morning till evening Why are you so tired? My mother-in-law. She's a headache Take it as your fate. You have to tolerate her That's true One should be lucky enough like Halim And husband should be like Kuddus Leave her with her parents until his mother is alive And take her back after mother's death But before returning to him she has to marry another man Will you go? - Not at all Go, you will get some change. - Shut up What happened now? You have spoken with them, right? I did a big mistake by divorcing Halim My wife and.. But this is a rule in your religion It's not in your hand. - You're right Someone will marry your wife temporarily Can't tolerate You're left with no choice. - I agree But what if the man she marries doesn't divorce her? His intention can change after seeing Halim What do I do if he doesn't divorce her? Don't think nonsense. Everything will be fine And we will discuss about all this before fixing alliance It's not a big problem If he doesn't divorce her, even Halim can ask for the divorce Then what's the problem? And what if Halim also didn't divorce him? Are you mad? She loves you a lot Even I love her a lot But my mind is getting blank You both love each other a lot. God can see that Everything will be fine But I can't even find a temporary husband for her It feels good if he doesn't but then I feel why can't I find any Don't understand anything Chief, I'm convinced with what you say We don't have any other option We will see what happens next If all of you are convinced then.. It's not a big issue. I will speak to him Fine Yes, come Balu. Come Salutations. - Hello Balu, chief's opinion is worth pondering over As you say My mind has stopped working I'm already indebted with one daughter's marriage Now, I've to marry her off twice And I've two more daughters You've started with it again We promised to help you. Right? We will also make your son-in-law help in this But... - Balu, at least listen to what chief says Speak up What I mean to say is that we are looking for a boy But can't find a suitable match. Right? So, I thought over it a lot and came to a conclusion So I called all of them for their advise You give your opinion Now, let's not look for a boy here and there In present circumstances I see only one man in front of my eyes And he's our priest Yes! What say? We will ask him If all of you agree we will go to him and request him I will speak to him And if he agrees everything will be fine As you say If that gentlemen agrees then my daughter will have a better life. - Yes Thank you Chief, you look after what to do Yes, I will speak to him Salutations. - Salutations Come, sit Sit, chief. - Yes Salutations. - Salutations Sit Sit So, Balu, did you find a groom? Don't feel dejected God is merciful. Have faith in Him Priest. We've faith in Him that's why we've come to you Now, only you can do something Yes, chief, I've sent information to the nearby villages We will get a match I wanted to tell you something different Tell me, without hesitation When you all have come together.. I understood that the matter is different Look, I will do anything I can. Tell me Only you can do this I didn't get you Chief, you tell him Well... What... what do I say.. You see how it is, priest? That even after so many efforts we couldn't find a better match And even if we find any in a day or two We can't trust this young generation What if he refuse to divorce after marriage? So, we thought that.. you help us in this See, everyone in the village wants to unite them And can we find a noble man like you in this world? So, we suggest that you marry Halim You lost the girl I had told you to marry her Now, sit and complain Leave it. Why would anyone take the burden on head? Idiot. You'd have got some fame in this way For helping someone. What say? Yes, of course See, the priest is getting praised everywhere And look at you Useless fellow. Remained useless Leave it. - Yes Anyway you wouldn't be able to do anything Don't talk nonsense Let me get married once then you will see Hey, who will give you a girl like Halim? Had you married her... - What do you mean? I will marry in this year only that too with a better girl than Halim Okay? And permanent Otherwise, I will change my name Alright then Think of another name Sister. Hey, sister Where are you lost? - Nowhere Now, we will alone have to stitch quilt Come, brother-in-law. Sit. Come, sit Brother-in-law. Are you sure you are going to take away my sister? Why? - No, even I wanted to come Shall I come? Coming I will just come. You continue talk But I want to come. - So, come After all, you're my sister-in-law Coming I was very scared. - Why? I thought if anyone else had agreed.. he would not have left a wife like you Then what would I have done? But priest is a kind man We will unite through that holy man We will come together again Don't worry Why are you crying? Don't worry. Everything will be fine But how can I share a bed with someone else other than you? I want to live with you only Can't we do anything else? Go. Show this to girl and ask her if she agrees Mois, Son of Abdul Salam Ansari.. is getting married to you You're getting Rs.151 cash Do you accept him? Yes I accept him Do you accept him? Yes I accept him Do you accept him? Yes I accept him Sheikh Balu, son of Akhar has given his daughter Halim to you in marriage, in presence of the witnesses Do you accept her? Say that I accept. I agree I've accepted and I agree Her and her token amount Her and her token amount I accept and I agree I accept and I agree Come Sit I can understand your situation But let me tell you that I've done all this for your and Kuddus' betterment To reunite the two of you.. I've married you as per the rules And now, we will have to follow this rule As per the rule of 'Halal', as a husband I will have to spend at least a night with you Only then you will be able to marry Kuddus again as per the rules of Quran And let me tell you.. I'm a strict follower of Quran's rules So, it is my duty that with you, I must.. Come, aunt. I'm going. Halim is sleeping Priest, at least take some tea. I will make it right away No, aunt. Serve tea to Halim when she wakes up I'm going Kuddus, are you going? - Yes. I'm quite late Now, only three months. Then you won't get late Then everything will happen in time, right?

Don't worry I'm somehow running the house doing household chores for people Had I been depending on you I'd be starving to death Telling me not to worry Child, finish everything quickly Today we must supply a quilt to Sharaja Now, you're alone to do it, okay? - Yes Child, finish it fast and help her. I am going Whatever you say, but Priest has given a push to Halim's life Yes, you're right Otherwise, she had no future She'd have died single And what would Balu do? He has three daughters. He's already lost in life What will he do now? Talk in simple language He's always talking in his profession's language Look, my life has passed in this shop And I will die working here So, people like if I use my profession's language No one will come to uplift me I'm not that lucky One should be lucky like Kuddus. - Yes He will get his once divorced wife back. - Yes What if someone else had married her in this time?

Why aren't you eating? You also eat with me. Come on, take your plate No, you eat. I will eat later I will feel good if you eat with me Brother. It seems you've brought new cooker You really care about your wife It seems you've started preparing for your new life No, it's nothing like that Actually, I didn't have it at home. That's why. What's the use even if you had any? Who was there to cook at home? But now your wife will come so you must bring it So, when will you bring your wife? - In a month or two Don't worry. Everything will be fine Yes Hey... bring something to arrange the utensils Okay, I will Today you came early in the afternoon But I've yet not cooked food And what's this? Check it. It's for you For me? Did you like it? Yes What must be my daughter doing? So many days have passed but I haven't seen her Mother, all the works are over You had told us to go once we finish this work Yes. Before we take up another job, you go Seriously, mother? - Yes Go tomorrow I will cook mutton for her Give it to her She loves it Sahida! - Sister Vannu. - Sister How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? Come inside. Sit Sit Sister, we miss you a lot What are you looking at? Sister. - Yes You look very beautiful. - Yes You have also put on. Brother-in-law will get mad to see you Leave it. How's mother? She misses you and cries at times She has also made mutton for you Why did you spend so much? I get everything here. He brings me anything I want The house is really good. - Yes Everything is properly arranged I've made it. Looks nice, isn't it? - Yes Sister. - Yes Brother-in-law had come. He gave me sweets He was asking about you Brother-in-law said he has bought all the kitchen accessories and clothes for you See this. He brought this saree for me. How's it? It's very pretty He's very intelligent And good too. He knows everything about our religion People come from long distance to take his advice And he thinks of everyone's betterment That's why he is doing all this so that you and brother-in-law can live happily Otherwise, such people are never found. - Yes Even if I make a mistake, he never complains Sister, you're very lucky Even your temporary husband is so good But brother-in-law I also very good Come on, get fresh. Come What happened? Tomorrow, people will come I will give you a second 'Talaq' tomorrow I'm scared.. if you've conceived due to me then.. This should not happen Nothing such will happen Everything is alright Meaning? Your menses? Thank God Priest, everything is fine Bring Halim out. - Yes Girl has put on weight. Seems well settled What say, Balu? Priest. Start with your procedure Halim. In presence of the jury members.. and in my complete sense.. I give you the second 'Talaq' (divorce) Bye. - Bye Bye. - Bye Bye. - Bye Only one month remain Thanks, priest Everything is going on smoothly all because of you I don't understand how to repay your favours Balu, this is God's wish. I'm just His child I follow the path He has shown. That's it Bye Bye. - Bye The second 'talaq' is given to Balu's daughter today Yes. But I still don't understand one thing How come she has still not conceived even after 2 months? Priest is a gentleman They must not have crossed their limits If that happens then the rule will not be followed Meaning? There's a condition in our rule They must consummate in marriage But Priest strictly follows religious rules Still the result is zero? It is strange. - Strange? It's nothing like that I think Halim has some flaws in her She lived with her husband for a year Still she never conceived It's good. The divorce will happen easily without any hurdle But if this is true then what's the use of Kuddus marrying Halim? First of all, marry a non-virgin girl Moreover, she will not conceive Then why is he so desperate? Even this is true That's okay. But you know what I feel? Shall I tell you? - Yes What if the priest wouldn't divorce her? Are you mad? Why do you talk nonsense? Will this be possible? Look, the priest is a gentleman No matter what but he will keep his word. - Yes But what if he will not? Why are you defaming that gentleman?

If you divorce Halim.. then also I will not marry her What are you saying, son-in-law? Why are you taking her seriously? She's naïve Not she.. but we're naïve I'm naïve I divorced my wife in anger This rule is made in our religion.. to punish a husband like me who divorces his wife any moment without a reason Then why Halim should suffer from my part of the punishment? And where am I going through the punishment in all this? But now I must go through it I will go through it I request you, priest Don't divorce Halim Her happiness is in your hands now Halim I will not let you suffer for my mistakes Forgive me
