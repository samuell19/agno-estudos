I really respect her. "A Wonderful performance, Miki." "-- Akiko." SAKURA BALLET SCHOOL Miki! You're Maekawa Miki, aren't you? Yes. I saw your performance. We've met before. I'm Kaibara Akiko. Akiko...? So you're the one who sent me that bouquet of flowers? That's right. That was the best portrayal of Odette I've seen in a long time. I talked to my brother earlier. He said you'd seen one of my performances. Yes. Seeing your portrayal of Giselle inspired me to take up ballet. Giselle... that brings me back. Giselle was my last ballet. Has there been any word from Genichiro? Nothing. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Maekawa Miki. Show Miki what you're learning. Jeté, ensemble. Dèveloppè, arabesque, soutenu. All right, on to the next lesson. - This way, Miki. - OK. Welcome. Please go ahead and change your clothes. Just a moment. Miki... What did you think of my students? The ensemble was very good. I was surprised. They haven't even been taking lessons for a year yet. But my lessons are strict. All my students live here and follow my rules to the letter. Well? Would you like to try a brief lesson here, Miki? What? Right now, this dance company is just my hobby. But I plan to introduce a new ballet at the Grand Theater eventually. And of course, you'll be my prima ballerina. You have all the necessary qualities. Also... If you live here, you might hear something from my brother. Have some Chartreuse. It's a liquor made at a French monastery. All right. What's wrong, Miki? Are you drunk? You're so pretty. No! Well? My students are wonderful, aren't they? Miki... join our circle of friends. Miss Kaibara, I'm with Genichiro... Forget about my brother. It's been a year since you've heard from him. I've already given up on him. Now... don't be soared. Your skin is so fair. I think you may have lost some weight. But I'm so glad we were able to start living together. I'll listen to any of your selfish desires while you're here. Sister! Genichiro! This year's research students are wonderful. It seems they're quite interested in their work. They have talent. I think you'll be absorbed in this work, too. Miki, stretch your legs more. Yes... Like that. You're so lovely, Miki... No! So cute... They're pink... Yes... Come on, Miki... No! No... You mustn't turn away from your most beautiful parts. Such beautiful flower petals... Already full of nectar. Miki... You're still a virgin, aren't you? But I want you. Look... You're ready. Here... take a look. What--? No! No! Don't worry. It's a two-way mirror. No need to be afraid. Well... Take a good look. Well? Did you see? You understand completely, don't you? From now on, you'll be doing the same thing with that boy here. But-- You don't like it? Don't say that. Come on. Teacher... What is it? Tell me. I... What? I can't hear you. I can feel it... Harder... Harder... It's so good... Yes... Well, then... No! No! Stop! She's nice and Wet. No! Look! No! There's nothing to be ashamed of. Watch as you're robbed of your virginity! Look! No! No! No! No! No! No! Give up. Once you come to this mansion, you can never go out. No! You can't survive without a man. Now you'll be a true female. In this mansion, you can do anything you want, as much as you want. That's what kind of place this is. Do whatever feels good... Do whatever you want to do! That is true pleasure. Open your legs. Move your hips! More! Miki! Are you awake? You must be thirsty. I'll give you some cola. Well? How does that taste? Do you want some more? Stop! Well? You must want to let it out now, right? No! Have a little more patience. Don't let it out! Don't let it out! Hold it! Yes... Don't let it out! Yes... Have patience. No! Well... how did you like today's lesson? Miki! Genichiro, are you going to Washington no matter what? It's been decided that I'm leaving next month. My company says I'll probably be there for two years. If you're comfortable with it, you can come visit me. I have a feeling I Won't see you anymore. I'm impressed. You aren't Wearing panties today. Do you want it? Say you want it! I want it... Genichiro, is something Wrong? It seems like somethings troubling you. Why did you lie to me? What? About Miki. Weren't you talking to Miki about me? Is that what you're angry about? Of course I'll let you see each other once the opportunity comes along. You think I can see her when I look like this? Genichiro, forget about Miki. She isn't thinking about you any-- Don't touch me! Genichiro! I saw Genichiro for the first time in a while the other day. Shall we invite him to tonight's party? Don't let Genichiro do those kinds of things. He's my only brother! Didn't you want to ruin his beloved Miki's life? What are you moping about? How about some tea downstairs? By the way, there's a party tonight. Will you join us? Let me go home. Hold it! Miki will be at the party tonight, too. It's a Wonderful scene, isn't it? Miki! Look. Miki is happy, too. Please... make it stop! Look! Look at her intoxicated face. Miki can no longer survive without men. Stop! Make it stop! Sister! Why... Why did you do such a stupid thing? You saw her, right? Miki... Miki was... Forget about Miki. That's what I told you, wasn't it? You really don't care, do you, Sister? About that... I wanted to show you. Now you know what kind of girl she is. She can't survive without men! Stop saying those things about Miki. You think I'd believe that you understand her? Genichiro... you still don't understand? Stop it! Genichiro! Miki, you got out of the mansion? What's wrong, Miki? Do you plan to stay here forever? Please, Miki! Please, Miki! Miki... Miki! Listen to me. I want to start over again! I understand. Genichiro? Genichiro... I was in a car accident in Washington. I was in a hospital over there for a year. But my body didn't fully recover. I was waiting for you. I wanted to see you. But I didn't want to bother you with this new body of mine. That's such a selfish thing to say. But... I'm not the man I used to be. Genichiro! I've changed, too. I'm a mess. Do you want to see my body? I'll show it to you. - Miki... - Look... You can still see the traces of countless men, can't you? Touch me! Stop it, Miki! Do you love me? Even now? Then show me you love me. I'm still packed full of other men's leftovers... ...so thrust your way in. Miki! Look... you're getting harder. That's not enough yet. Stop it, Miki! Stop it! Yes... That's right. Genichiro! Genichiro! Genichiro! Genichiro, are you all right? Speak to me! Genichiro! A girl like you... My throat is parched. What do you want to drink? Cola. You're choking me. I want to piss. You told me anything goes, didn't you? Well then, kiss me here. You're a good fit for this mansion. Let's begin the show for our new mistress. You poor boy... Going through such awful things. Genichiro, I Won't give you up to anyone else. Genichiro! Genichiro, are you all right? No! Stop it! What are you doing? I want to see what you two do together every night! Show it to me right now, before my eyes! You beast! Stop it! Genichiro! Genichiro, are you all right? Hold on! - Do it! - No! Stop it! Please! Don't hit me! Come on and do it! Sister... It's all right. Genichiro... It's a two-way mirror. No need to be afraid. Genichiro... Miki... THE END
