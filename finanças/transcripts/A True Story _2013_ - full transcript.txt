Ack in my home I sleep in a bed nd my mom does my laundry for e... ...And I eat food more than once a day. And not just dollar store bologna either, I'm talking about produce. Look, man. We've been working way too hard for this not to work out for us. What if you're wrong? We've been working on this script for almost two years now. What if there is no happy ending? What the fuck are we even doing here? This is our golden ticket, man! This is our ruby slippers, our red pill, our... Ok. So, this is the answer? This script is going to put food in our stomachs? I'm telling you, once people see our shit they'll be lining up to wipe our asses... Why would people line up to wipe our asses? You're too fucking tense. Relax, man. Go get some booty or something. Why don't you call that little girl that you used to work with? Which one? The one that likes you. Which one? The one that likes you. Yeah. That one. She's got an outie belly button. So? So, it's not the outie that bothers me, it's the fact that she wears cut off shirts all the time. It's as if she doesn't even know she has it. And that... it's just really off putting. Whatever, man. Just do what you gotta do to lighten up. What? Do you have to play so loud, so early? What the fuck man? Is this about rent or something? What's the matter with you? I wrote a scene you should read. It's a flashback. I thought we could put it in... Unnecessary. People don't care what happened before. They want to know what happens next. It'll add depth to the characters. Yeah, and slow down the story. And quit trying to change the subject, man. For the last week you've been acting like a little bitch! What's the matter with you? Tell me. My ex-girlfriend called me. Deanna? She moved to LA a few of months ago. Really? She lives like a block away from here. No shit. Yeah, man. She called me up. She said she wanted to meet for coffee. And that's a bad thing? Yeah, it is a bad thing. It took me almost three years to get over her. And you never really get over them. You know? No. No? No, she's a chick. One's like the next. You stop banging her, then you start banging someone else. Rs later, she wwhat's the probl What world do you live in? A world where I'm the king, king bangs a lot of chicks. I'd like to visit that world sometime. It's nice there. Oh, I bet. What world do you live in? The real world. Oh, I've heard of that. Yeah, That's the one. S that the same world where you aven't seen your ex irlfriend in three years ...But she still has you by the balls? Hey, that's below the belt. That's where your balls are. So, tell me about this girl. Which girl is that? The girl you don't talk about. Deanna, the love of your life. I didn't say she was the love of my life. You said you never got over her. Only because another girl never came along. If it's really love another girl won't come along. Well... You're still in love with her. I didn't say that. Are you going to go to coffee with her? I did. You did? I did. How'd that go for you? It was ok. OK? Yeah, it was OK. Bullshit, what happened? I met her last week... Deannas not like other girls. She never was. And she was just how I remembered her. She's the kind of girl that just looks like she smells good? ...And she does. She's the kind of girl that pees bunnies... And poops sunshine? No. No. She doesn't poop at all. You look great. Oh, yeah, thanks. Your hair... I know, it's long. I was going to say, you dyed something to it, cause it's longer. Do I really look that different? No, you look fine. You look okay. You just, I mean, you just kinda.. Thanks. Why'd you call me? Well, um... Mike Junior turns two in a few weeks, ...And I thought it was finally time I told you about him. Oh... Oh, God. I'm just fucking with you. You make it too easy. Oh my god! I thought... Why would you... Sorry. There's no Mike Junior! Don't worry. No, it's fine. It's not a big deal. She really said that? Yeah, that's her sense of humor. I like this girl. Mike, I called you because we're friends. Oh right, we're friends. We've always been friends. Don't you have other friends? Not in L.A. L.A. is a big city. Especially when you have no friends. Can we be friends, Mike? I mean, it's been a long time. Two years? 3 years. This February 21st. I can't believe you remember the date. That was a pretty memorable night, remember? Yeah. So, what are you doing in L.A. now anyway? I'm trying to be a wri... I've been working on my wri--I'm wri--I'm a writer. So what have you written? I wrote a screenplay. Wow! What's it about? It's a love story, about two guys... What? Damn it. No. There's a girl, too. Like 4 girls. And, we-we wrote it together. We? Oh, my partner. Ean, he's not..We don't... we ne We're roommates. We act. We both are actor and writers. So, it's like we wrote it to be in it together. Once it gets made. That's when we'll do it. The movie. That's when we'll do it. The movie. Cool. Really, Mike? She makes me nervous! Clearly. So, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to school up north. Yeah, I was, but only because my dad wanted me too. I was over it. So, I thought I'd give the whole acting thing a try. I mean, how hard can it be, right? Yeah. Look, Mike... I miss you. I just wanted to tell you, That I really am sorry for everything that happened. You're sorry? Yeah. How come you never called? I did. You didn't. No I didn't, did I. You know, Deanna, it was really good to see you, ..But I have a lot of things to do, so... Mike... What? Can I see you again sometime? No, no... its not a good idea. Why? Because I can't see you if I can't be with you. I can't be with you without becoming attached to you. I can't become attached to you without getting hurt. It's not worth it. You're not worth it. Now I know you didn't say that. I did. Look, I do want to see you. I do want to hang out with you. I-I-I just can't. Not now, you know? Just give me some time. Yeah... Yeah... That's it? That's it. So, she's really not worth it? No, she's worth it, but I had to say no, and that was the only way I could. Could what? Say no. Oh. Why did you have to say no? I told you, I can't go through what I went through the last three years. But if she's the one... She's not. How do you know? I don't know, I just know I can't get hurt again. But you said she was worth it. She is. So what's the problem? I have syphilis. What?! I just told you twenty fucking times, dude, I don't want to get hurt again! But you don't have syphilis... No! I don't know, man. I thought maybe... You would know if I had syphilis. How would I know? I mean, how would I know? There'd be creams around the house... I don't keep track of your creams. Well, you should, and then you'd learn some stuff about me. Call her. No. Did she make you happy? Yes. Have you been happy since? No. If you were happy with her, and you're not happy without her, why don't you just be happy with her... again. She's the reason I was unhappy. She's also the reason you were happy... Yes. There's no unhappy without happy. You're only unhappy because you lost what made you happy. She's not what made you unhappy, it's the absence of her that made you unhappy. We're out of toilet paper. Evil is only the absence of good. OK, but... what do I... You call her! Okay. Fine. But, I'm gonna go look for her number. You've got it memorized. No, I DON'T! Ok! Go look for it! Funny. What can I get you? Let me get a cup. Large? Larger than average. Hey, Deanna. It's Mike. Yeah. No, I was gonna say you should... I mean, if you wanna... If you would come over? Yeah, I mean, I dont want you to put out. P-P-Put you out. I dont wanna put you out. Put you out..of your... comfort zone. Because you, or everybody, should be in the zone. Sometimes. Yeah. I'll see you later then. Ok. Bye. No, thanks. There he is! Mikey! How you doin', Mikey? Hmm, Mikey- this is Amanda. Hi. Hi. You want a sandwich? Yes, Why would you even ask me? Here. Peanut butter & jelly. It's on me. Really? Yeah. Really? Really? Please. Okay. MATT Yes, I know where it is. We will be there in fifteen minutes. We gotta go. We gotta go. You must be Michael and Matt. Thank you so much for coming on short notice. Jason will be right with you. So, you just follow me. Ok. Have you ever been to a sound stage before? No. Ng if you could (Assistant answe Oh, hi Toby. How are you? I'm good. I'm at work. Umm, what's the shoot? Let me call you back. It's 'SKINNY PETE'. Skinny who? Pete. ...And what's your name? Uh huh! Now you boys stay right here, and I will go get Jason for you. Listen, why don't you shit on a carrot and take your ass to fuckin' Africa?! Com-come on! Get the fuck outta my way, man. Listen, listen, listen... That's my deal. Tha-- Yo wassup fellas! What's up, Mikey? What up, Matty? Welcome to the set. Welcome to the set. Are you hungry? Grab some food, drinks... all that good stuff. You guys know Skinny Pete right? Yeah, I've got his album. Not personally. Of course you don't. Follow me to my office. Yo, put the banana down. Put the banana down! Damn, greedy ass mother fuckers on my team. Anyway, listen. That's the deal, man. That is the deal. And that's all I can offer. And, I'm gonna stand firm on it. Jason! Yeah, wassup baby? Dude is trippin, man! What?! I'm just trying to loosen it up. You know... Pop my shit. Get my, you know what I'm saying? What the fuck is that? Dude, you too big for that. Come on, man. That is not the look. Listen, these my peoples. Matty, Mikey. Skinny Pete in the flesh. I love you. Represent that 5-1-0, baby. Bay area, you know how we do. Yeah, I do know. Killers and gorillas, man. Poppin' off this video shoot, doin it big like skinny. You know what I'm saying? Yes, I do. Well, shit. Maybe we'll see you later? Yes, I would like that. Don't let the man get you down, kid. Who's the man? I'm the man. Skinny Pete bitch! Alright fellas. My office over here. You're having Briana's birthday is still on the 9th at the park, right? Little momma gettin big, little momma gettin big. Right through here, fellas. Right through these doors, right through these doors. Listen, man- fuck your seven percent! Make this shit work. Stop being too Hollywood for me. So, here's the deal. I got Richard to read your script. Richard? Richard Simpkins. Oh... How do you get Richard Simpkins to read our script? Skinny Pete shI'm an assistant When he does a movie, I'm an associate producer. The thing is, I found you guys. I found the script. So when this gets made, I'm executive producer. With points. And guess what? He thinks it's good. Uhh, How good? What? How good? Like South Park good, or like, The Iliad good? He thinks it's good. He thinks-- Actually, he said you guys reminded him of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. He's never seen us. I know, but he read the script that you both wrote. So, he can kinda imagine. So, according to Richard Simpkins, Mike and I are like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Yeah. Okay! Who's Ben Affleck and who's Matt Damon? What? Which one of us Ben and which one of us is Matt? Dude, I don't know. Don't answer that. Why not? Because that would mean one of us has no talent. Exactly. That's fucked up. C'mon man, we can take it. Listen, I think both you guys are talented. Not if we're Ben and Matt. We're not Ben and Matt. Jason said we were. Richard said you were. Neither of us are like either of them. That's a ridiculous comparison. That's like trying to compare jeans to denim. Jeans are denim. Yeah, I know. I just don't think we should be trying to compare ourselves to anybody. We are us. Originality is overrated, fellas. It takes a lot more than talent to make it in this business. It takes smarts. It takes connections. You could be the most untalented person. Ever. Ake friends witdo a couple inde ...And next thing you know you're making 20 million a film and banging J-Lo. What do you guys have against Ben Affleck? Oh, nothing. He's great. He's done alot of great work. Huge fan. Armageddon, are you kidding? Did you see 'Gone baby Gone'? 'Gone baby gone' was good, too. I liked that. He's a good director. Know's story structure. Was he in it too? No, not at all. Hollywood Land? Casey killed that too. The time periods. Giglie was a miss. Not his fault! Anyways.... listen, listen. If Richard makes an offer, are you guys interested? Oh yeah, I mean, yeah we're... Of course we're interested. Great! That's great. I was hoping you'd say that. To set. I'll cWe'll talk detai . Aight, Mikey. Work that out, baby. Work that out. Listen, y'all can hang out. You don't gotta leave. I just gotta go. Peace. Really? What are you doing? It's party time. It's not work time! Dude, when we meet Richard I want to have more to show him. Isn't your girl coming over? Yeah, she'll be here in a little bit. I just want to write something right now. Alright, alright... What are you trying to write? I don't know. I'm just going to start writing a script. So what should I write about? I don't care. Alright, fine. I'm just gonna start writing. Don't start that way. It's stupid. Well, then how should I start? I don't know! Well, then shut up and let me write. Are you hungry? Starving. You're cranky when you're hungry. Thank you. We should get some food. We can get some later. I just want to write right now. But you're hungry now...? Yeah... Then we should eat now! Dude, I'm not thinking about food right now. You just said you were hungry. You asked! I know! If you aren't going to help me write, leave me alone. Fine, I'll go and get some food. Fine, go. What should I get? I don't care! Quizbees? Fine! You know what? Fuck you! I fucking hate you. You have all these great ideas, you want to do all these great things, but you don't do shit. You don't pay rent, I buy all the food, and I never once get a thank you! You leave your socks everywhere. Fucking everywhere! I opened the refrigerator yesterday and there were three socks in there. I could maybe understand if there were two or four, but three? It takes a conscious effort to leave three socks anywhere, let alone the refrigerator. I can't drink milk anymore without smelling your feet! I'm sick of this shit! I don't know why I'm your friend. You are worthless. You're like a child. Except not as good as a child, because children grow up and become things. You will never become anything, ever. You have never been good at anything, ever! You are a complete waste of life, you give me gas, and I want you to you die. Did you like that? Yeah, that was good. Yeah, that was good. It had, uhh, there was some structure. Yeah, it was loud. Yeah well, you know, it was well-delivered. I thought. That's going in the script. Yeah, I'll find somewhere for it. And that's why I get a writer's credits. You didn't write anything. You just heard me write it. I wrote what I said. No! You said what you said. I know that you said it, because I heard you say it. You haven't actually written anything. I'm the one who's going to write it. I haven't written it yet, but I'm going write it. Just cause you're the one that types it up, doesn't mean it wasn't my idea. It was my idea, and you should respect that. Respect? Yeah, respect! Give credit where credit is due! Credit? Okay. Let's say we were cooking... I go out and buy a whole pound of chicken. I marinate that chicken for three days with Laurie's seasoning salt, vinegar, ketchup and Mrs. Dash salt free seasoning blend. You've been practicing this one? Yeah, a little bit. MATT It's good. I know. Shut up. Let me finish. I make up some angel hair pasta with a creamy garlic basil sauce. I set the table, I open a bottle of 1997 Canoe Ridge Chardonnay, and we have ourselves a dinner. You walk in. You notice I did some cooking so you sprinkle some basil on the chicken and ddenly you're the fucking chef?! I do lot more than sprinkle some basil! It is not the same! Yes it is! It is the exact same fucking thing! You want credit for adding a little bit extra to something I worked my ass off... on. You're just not willing to admit that I have all the ideas. All the ideas? All the good ideas! You're right. I'm not willing to admit that because you don't. You have some good ideas, but I'm the one who writes them down. That makes me the writer. It all comes from my head. If I tell you a story and you write out my story, that makes me the writer! No, it doesn't! Yes, it does! I'm the writer. You're just good at typing. You said maybe three things that I'm going to use in the script. The "socks in the fridge", "you're like a child", "you give me gas"... those were funny. Thank you. You're welcome. I also thought the cooking metaphor was brilliant. I didn't say that. You did. I know, and it was fucking brilliant. I think your ego is getting in the way of your common sense. I think you use big words to try to make yourself sound smart. Ego isn't a big word. It's only three letters. Yeah, but it's got a big meaning. All ego means is a frozen waffle. No, that's an Eggo. Whatever. You want to get it or you want me to get it? I'll get it. Then get it. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna get it. Hi. I'm Deanna. Matt. Hi, Matt. You're right, Mike. She's got great boobs. He's just kidding 'cuz you don't have--I mean, you have- umm- it's not that I told him that you did. Not that I wouldn't have, but its not like something I just tell people on a regular basis. But you do. I like your place. Thanks. It's small, but it's home. Can I get you something... to drink? A gin Cosmo with lime, easy on the cranberry. That'd be great. Hey Matt, could you get us some gin? No. You know what? I think I might actually have some in my room. So I'm just gonna go look.... No, it's really.. It's not a big de--.... So Matt, what do you do? Eat, fuck and sleep. Why? Uh... Mike says you're a writer. Well, Mike's really the writer, I just sprinkle some basil on his chicken. What? Nothing. So... You play the piano? Nope. I'm an actress. Wow. An actress in L.A. You must be interesting and unique. You and Mike are both actors. Don't you consider yourselves interesting and unique? No. Really? We moved to Hollywood to make movies, and so did about two million other guys who are relatively attractive and were popular in High School. So, no. The only thing that makes us unique is knowing that we're not unique. But, if you think you're unique, for knowing you're not, you still think you're unique, right? Clearly. So then that kinda just makes you like everybody else? Exactly. You're smarter than you look. Don't I look smart? I'm having trouble finding the gin. I think that I... maybe... it just kinda disappeared. Well, not like magic. Like "poof", it's gone. It's just disappeared. WOO, in thin air. It's nowhere. But I think probably I just drank it when I was depressed. Not that I'm depressed or drink by myself. But who doesn't drink when they're alone? You know if they're depressed, or If one were to be depressed? So its probably in there. I should just probably keep looking. Cuz' it probably, maybe, just disappeared. Like magic. Like poof! So, I'm just gonna keep looking. Then, you know, we can figure it out from there. It's not really... a big deal. So Matt, do you have a girlfriend? I don't have any friends. DEANNA I can't imagine why. What was that? No, nothing. I'm sure deep down, you're a really nice person. Then you're a terrible judge of character. So no..no love in your life? None? Why do you care? I'm just trying to make conversation. OK... well, I could never love a woman who would let me treat her the way that I treat women when I love them. Too much of my father in me, I guess. What was your father like? I don't know. I never met him. What's your 'daddy' like? He works a lot. Makes a lot of money? He does alright, I guess. That must be nice. I work, too. Yeah. So do I, but my father doesn't pay my rent. I thought you didn't know your father. Exactly. So, I definitely don't have any gin. Like officially. I think that one night we were playing flag football there was a few... I'm going to go out and get some food. You want anything? You want anything? No, I'm good. I ate already. She's in L.A. now. Girls in L.A. don't eat. Mikey? No, No- I don't want anything. We're celebrating. It's on me. OK, I'll have something. What should I get? Why don't you go to Quizbies? I'll go to Quizbies! Bye Matt. Yeah, whatever. Matt seems like a good guy. No, he is. It's just hard to tell sometimes. Why are such good looking guys always such jerks? I mean, I dont mean to be rude. I know he's you're friend and... No, you're right. Good looking guys are jerks. Just big old attractive assholes, running around handsomely pissing people off. What happened to that cute little Asian girl who used to work here? Oh, Mary? Um, she got fired for giving away food I think. You know, I didn't think you'd call. I probably shouldn't have. Why not? You're trouble. You like my kind of trouble though. No, Deanna, I don't. You really... I mean... why did you do it? I don't know why I did it, Mike. I was young. I-I wasnt... You were young? So, I was young. We're still young! What does that even mean? People make mistakes when they're young. Mistakes? You didn't make a mistake, Deanna. You shit all over everything I gave you. What did you give me? Me. Mike... That's why I shouldn't have called you. Mike, I know this is weird for you. It's weird for me, too. But... I've been thinking alot about things recently and... You know, no other guy has ever treated me like you did. You were good to me, Mike. And I miss everything we had... I miss you. I miss you too. I miss you too. I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can do this. You should go. You're gonna make me go? Yeah. Are you going to call me? I don't know. You don't know? Hmm, okay.... Bye Mike. Bye Deanna. Bye Matt. Hate to see you go... you know the rest. I thought you were going to Quizbies? I did, but you know it's nine bucks for a sandwich there? You could get a whole fucking pizza for nine bucks. You could get two pizzas for nine bucks. You know, there's a pizza place next door there... Fuck, what's the matter with me? What is the matter with you? So, uh... are you gonna bang her later? No, Matt. That's the last thing on my mind right now. Bullshit, you're tilting the table. Matt... now's not the time. Of course, now's the time. You were just alone with the best piece of ass you've ever had and you haven't been laid since grade school. You should at least rub one out. Jesus. What'd this girl do to you? She said I treated her good, and then kissed me. Wow, what a bitch. What'd she do on February 21st? Oh... it's a long story. Yeah, yeah- when have you ever told me a story that wasn't long? I met her at this house party. She lived with a bunch roommates and... I'd gone to high school with one them. They lived in this big house and were always throwing parties... Karate and Love. Those are my weapons, Mikey. You know what I mean? I'll talk to you later, Boo. Don't worry about it. Hey, dude. You gotta treat every woman here like a chia pet. You know what I mean? Put your pasty seeds on them, and watch them grow. You know what I'm sayin'? I poked holes in all my condoms tonight. I'm gonna find a rich girl with conservative parents that think we should get married. Hey, there's Deanna. Who? My roommate, Deanna. She looks good too. I'm really sore. What? Oh, I was just saying I'm really sore. I was at the gym all day today. Did some pecks, my legs... Even did some lats too. Lats, huh? Yeah, super sore. What I really gotta work on is my biceps. I'm gonna get an awesome tribal arm band tattoo. And it needs to look awesome. And the more awesome my biceps look, the more awesome my tattoos will look. And the more awesome my biceps look, the more awesome my tattoos will look. Dude. If you too boink, it's gonna be so weird. I do not want to hear the noises you make when you fuck. I got a nintendo. With Mike Tyson's punch out. And I know the code and how to get him. Sup, Deanna? How come you're not swimming? Everyone is swimmin'. Oh... no. My arms are kinda sore. Yeah, mine too. From working out all the time. But, you know, the pool is good for it. Plus, once I get my awesome tribal band tattoo... ...I won't be able to go swimming as much. Zero zero seven three seven three five nine six three. Done. He's there. I almost beat him the other day but, you know, the phone kept ringing. Come on. The pool is nice and hot. Kinda like the T-Dawg. Go for it. Alright. Your loss. Mike- I should tell you... I-I-I have a boyfriend. Oh. Well, we shouldn't be doing this... He's out of town. It's okay. Yeah, but still... He's not nice to me, Mike. Oh... I'll break up with him tomorrow. OK. ...And I was completly smitten with her. We ended up being together for 2 years. We went on vacations. She let me drive her car. We had anniversary dinners. Two of them. Morning after pills? No. Once. So what'd she do? If it were up to me and I was in charge of calling movies things... I would've called it, "There Will Be Oil". Cuz' there was a shit ton of fucking oil. I don't know. I fell asleep. I don't know if there was oil, blood or what. Babe, I have to get up early in the morning. Ok. Let's go to bed. No, I don't want to wake you up when I have to get up. So, I just... I feel like I should just sleep in my own bed tonight. Really? Mike, are you in love with me? Yeah. No, I mean... are you in love with me? Yes, I'm... I'm so in love with you. Are you happy? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's relative, because I'm not always happy. Sometimes if I stub my toe or slam my hand in the car door I'm not happy. Definitely wasn't happy when my grandma died, although she did leave me some money. I mean, that made me happy. It's just there's different ratio's of happy to unhappy. I-It's a whole... I'm sure there's a book or a diagram or something that I could get if I had to. Tell you what? Why dont I make you a pie chart? If you have a pen and some construction paper... Where are we going to be in 5 years from now? Or 10 years? Or even tomorrow? Well, where do you want to be in 10 years? Are you happy? I'll tell you what. How about you figure that out and when you know, make me a pie chart. So I'm driving and I realize this girl was the best thing that ever happened to me. If she wanted to talk about some shit, I needed to talk to her about some shit. I realized that I couldn't let her get away. So I turned around and I start driving back to her place as fast as I can. The front door was open, so I walked right in. I found her in the back yard, on top of Trevor. The fucking douchebag with the tribal armband tattoo. Only she was facing me. Wai-Wait, so she was like...? Yes! God! Why are you doing that!? I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get the picture. We're in public! It's a good one! Anyway- so what'd you do? You kill the guy or what? I just left. I just left. She came running after me wrapped in the table cloth. I was just standing front of her house screaming "why?". Over and over again. And I remember her, standing there half naked. Just staring at me. And when I finally calm down, she just looked at me and said... You just weren't enough for me, Mike. You just weren't enough for me, Mike. I've been hearing that in my head every day for the last three years. "You weren't enough for me, Mike." Wow. How'd you handle it? I didn't even leave my place for about a month. What'd you do by yourself for a month? I read... a lot. Got through some books. Did some crossword puzzles. You keep yourself busy. Anyways. A few weeks later... I just missed her so much. So I called her, but she never called me back. Last week was the first time I talked to her since that night. Wow. Well, now I definitely think you should bang her. What? You should either bang her or not bang her. Ohhh, thank you. That's great. You should either cut it off right now. Never call her again Ever. Or call her over tonight, bang her, and then never call her again. It's not that easy, Matt. Yes it is. She fucked you. She fucked you 'cause she fucked you, then she fucked him. Fuck her! You should fuck her by fucking her, then fuck her! If I do that to her, then I'm no better than she is. Oh my God, you get no vagina because you're made out of vaginas. I hate you so much. I know. Okay, Mike. I'm sorry. Seriously. Call that girl over here tonight and bang her. Or fuck her. Or make love to her. The way you remembered it. The way that you've been thinking about it for three years. Do anything and everything you've ever wanted to do to a girl, to her. 'Cause you fucking deserve it! Then in the morning, say "thanks!", and tell her to leave. Then move on and forget about her. I'm telling you after what she did, it's what you have to do to feel right again. You really think that'll work? I do. I'm gonna do it. I'm calling. Alright. I'll be in my room, listening to every word. So... man up. Make me proud. I will, man. I will. Hey Mike? Yeah Matt? No matter what happens tonight... Richard Simpkins wants to make our movie! I know, man. I know. Hey, Mike. Yeah, Matt. I think I found your syphilis cream. Yeah. Big bitch. Big bitch. I'm glad you decided to call. Oh yeah? I knew you would. Really? How'd you know I'd call? Because we were meant to be together Mike. You really think so? I've always thought that. You've always thought that we were meant to be together? Even though we haven't talked in three years? Mike. Did you think we were meant to be together when you just left a box with all my stuff in it, sitting on my porch. I didn't know what else to do? Did you think we were meant to be together when I called you every day for two ...weeks and you just never called me back? Mike, I didn't know what to say. I was embarrassed. Oh, you were embarrassed?! You know what's really embarrassing, actually? It's when you have to explain to your family and all of your friends why you don't have a girlfriend why you don't have a girlfriend anymore. That's really embarrassing. Well, you didn't have to go telling everyone what happened. Oh, what was I not supposed to tell them? Did I not have to tell them that you fucked some other dude? Why can't you just move on and get over it? What else do you want from me? I want you to hurt. I want to give you a reason to never come back. ...But I can't. I wouldn't even know how. So I'm going to bed. And you can get the fuck out of here. And you can get the fuck out of here. How'd you sleep? What do you mean how'd I sleep? What do you think I mean? How'd you sleep? On my back with my eyes closed. C'mon man, I'm just trying to be your friend here. Why are you trying to be my friend? I am your friend. I know you're my friend, so why are you "trying" to be my friend? Sometimes you just don't sleep at night. Well, I slept last night. I thought I heard you up last night. I got up to pee. I heard you too. Heard me what? I heard you pee. Oh. I gotta to get to work. I'm gonna take a shower. Are you okay? I'm fine. Go. How do I look? You need to go. Why? 'Cause you don't live here. Oh... OK. Let's go. Where are we going? Away. Wha-- what? Where? Where? Shh. Let's go. Ouch. That hurts. Stop. It hurts. Matt, Stop it. Stop it. What is your problem? My problem? You know... You're exactly what I thought you were. What does that mean? Did you ever care about Mike? Of course. I love Mikey, he's easy to love. But this isn't about him. Why are you.. Yeah. Get out. No. S-Stop. Stop. Matt, Matt! W-what are you doing? Matt! You know. You're right. You don't have to go. Why don't we all hang out and watch a Giants game? Then you, me and Mike can all go out to the movies together. Hold hands and share one big diet coke. Fuck, while we're at it, why don't you move in, rent free! I'll fuck you on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Mike can fuck you Mondays and Wednesdays, and on the weekends you can blow who ever you want. Just brush your teeth and wash your cunt, and we'll all be one big happy fucking family! You are unbelievable! Yeah, me. I'm the bad guy. Get the fuck out of here! Why are you doing this to me? You just weren't enough for me, Deanna. How's that feel? How's that feel right now? I hope you think of this moment everyday for three years, and you fucking cry. Get the fuck out of here. Don't ever come back here... ever. Don't ever come back here... ever. Yo, Matty! Whats crackin', baby? What's up, man? Whats goin' on? Just chillin all Mathew McConaughey on your porch. That's cool. Yeah. What're you doing here? I tried calling you on your cell phone, but it's disconnected. Again. Bills, man. Bills. I spoke to Richard again last night. MATT Yeah? Yeah, yeah- we went over some things. He has some ideas for the script. Great. What kind of ideas? Well you know, just some small changes... Changes? Yeah, changes. I fear change. Oh. Uhhh. Just kidding, what kind of changes? The ending needs to be different. We don't like it. What don't you like about it? Well, it's weak right now. The ending isn't weak, it's realistic. People don't want realistic, they want happy. People relate to a real story. Happy endings aren't real. I'd like to speak to Mike about this. You're talking to me. I want Mike to hear what I have to say. Okay... I'm going to put some clothes on. Yeah, do that. Your balls all up in my face and shit. God damn. MIKE! Jason, what's up man? Yo, Mike. The end of the script needs to be changed. I fear change. Ah! See! Okay, but check it... The ending has been the ending since the beginning. If we knew at the beginning that the ending would be different, we would've made the beginning different when we began. Mike, I'm offering you a chance to make some serious money. We're trying to make art, not just money. Well, then you are in the wrong town. I think people will appreciate what we are doing. No, they won't. People are stupid. They'll buy what we sell them and believe what we tell them. You think Skinny Pete is from Oakland? Naw. Foster City, son. OK, Jason, how do you think we should change the ending? Well, right now, nobody gets the girl. Somebody needs to get the girl. But that ruins the whole point. Who do you think should get the girl? Mike... I think Jack should. No. If anyone gets the girl it should be John. Nobody gets the girl! John loved that girl his whole life, he wants to end up with her.. Yeah, but Jack is the heart throb character. He's the bad boy. Female audiences are going to want to see him in a love scene. Jack is not the bad boy. That's not how we see him. What about the love scene with John and the girl? It's wack, son. I mean, It's not steamy enough. Plus- John's kind of a nerd, you know. A nerd?! I can't believe either of you. The story isn't about the girl! It's about John and Jack, and their friendship being stronger than some stupid girl. Even Brokeback Mountain had Jake Gyllenhaal bang a girl. We're not trying to make Brokeback Mountain! Well, it's look like the sequel unless one of those guys gets the fucking girl! Look. If this thing is gonna make any kind of money... Why is it always about the money? Because it costs money to make a movie, Matt! I mean, if anyone is going to invest in this they're going to do it for a profit. That's how it works. I understand that, but I think people will like it the way it is. Whether people like it or not is irrelevant. Can we get pre-sales for the DVD in foreign markets? Will Coke or Red Bull be interested in product placement? Those are the questions that need to be asked. And the happier the ending... ...The more likely those answers will be yes. I would like to meet with Richard. Now we're talking. Mike... Matt-we've gotten this far. I don't wanna... Can we, can we get a meeting? Yeah. Ten fifteen tomorrow morning. ...And look nice. Please. Sleeves, please. Thank you. Thank you. Good. I'll see you in a little bit. OK, Bye. Why did you give in? We haven't changed anything yet, I just don't want to blow this. We can't change the ending. Maybe he's right. Maybe we're going about this wrong. Artistic integrity is great, but if we never sell a single script, then what's the point? I want to sell scripts, I just don't want to sell out. Well we need to sell something before we can sell out! I don't want to change the ending. I don't want to either. I'm not gonna go to work today so I can just stay in and look at the script. You're not going to work?! No. You have no money! Why the fuck would you miss work? I moved to LA to be a writer, not to walk a fucking dog. Then go to work now and work on the script later! I can't do that! Why, because you're lazy? No, because I have a date tonight! With a girl? Yes, with a girl. How'd you get that? I called a girl and asked her out. When? Like a minute ago. Right before you came up here and started yelling at me. I need some help. Oh, you need money. No. I mean... yeah. But no. Well, yeah. I need some help remembering how to... do it. Do what? MIKE Bang a chick. I don't even remember how. Oh my god. Well I remember what it was like... and I know where everything goes... it's just ...getting there without... I feel like if I were gonna... Well, this one time I was... I don't wanna talk about that. If I know I have a good shot.... OK, look, I can help you... Thanks, man. First of all, do you really think you're going to bang this girl tonight? No, but I mean... Okay, there's your problem. You are always going to bang the girl. Always. OK, right. Confidence. Now... Remember, sex doesn't start at the end of the date, it starts at the beginning. You gotta keep those sexual thought alive in her head. How? Touch her. All night. Not on the ass or on her boobs, boobie time will come to those who wait. Just touch her hand, or brush her hair out of her face. You know, find reasons to always be touching her. So, if this all works out for me, and were about to get busy. What's the best way to... Get busy? Yeah. Okay, okay. Let's say she's... Ummm... front or back? Either way. I don't really have a preference. Alright.... So, If she's here... is she flexible? Does she... How tall is she? She's like... Does she do yoga? Medium to... Does she do yoga? Does she do yoga? Uh, she looks like a yogi. Okay. A girl is like a piano. Always know what song you are going to play before you start. ...and always start slow. And soft. A song has a beginning, a middle and an end. You can't just... end the song abruptly. With no warning. All over her nice pillows. With no warning. All over her nice pillows. No matter how hard you try, if you only hit one spot... Your never going to make music. That's how she feels. Irritating. Irritating. ...And if you are going to be playing a piano you've never played before... Wear a condom. "...When I'm I'm awfully low and the world is cold." "I will feel a glow, just thinking of you..." "And the way you looked, last night!" Oh my God, you did it! Oh my God, I did it! Aye, aye, aye... Did you do it like this? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Did you do it like... like that? Oh yeah! Hell yeah, I did! Did you do it like this?! No! ... Just kidding, we did it like that too! I am so proud of you! I am so in love! Wha-what? Dude- I don't know how, I don't know why, but I-I-I'm fuckin' in love. Does she have a magical vagina or something? What? No... Did it bake you cookies, or do your taxes? No. It was just, hum, a great night... I'm just saying, this girl sounds pretty special. Dude- she is. She is so special. If they had an Olympics for girls that were special, she would win. You mean like the Special Olympics? No... not like the special olympics. Girl from the SNo, no, no I'm n She would be in the regular Olympics if she were an athlete. Honestly, dude. You were right. It wasn't her that made me unhappy. It was the absence of her that made me unhappy. What? Hey, Deanna. What are you doin here? Mike, you forgot your bag. Actually, I'm really glad you here. I was thinking we can all go get some food? Aten in foreverI guess I'm alwa ...But we got food last night, but it was a salad 'cause the place was expensive. And I didn't wanna, like, get food 'cause she was paying. Ank you, again.For like the twe seriously, I was just thinking e the three of us can go down somewhere. ...Get a delicious meal. Oh, dude! We got our meeting today. What am I doing? I gotta go put on my lucky suit! As for my grandWhich really was y's gonna be grSo I'm willing t y's gonna be grSo I'm willing t You must be out of your Goddamn mind. You think you can tell me what to do? You don't know a thing about me, Matt. You think you got me all figured out. I'm exactly what you thought I was. Well, how does this feel right now? Huh? Helpless? Mike's told me about you. How he's your only friend and how you need him. So, go ahead and tell your only friend that you fucked his girlfriend. Or don't. What difference does it make? You're a fucking whore! Matt! What the fuck, dude? You don't understand. Ok, explain it to me. Yeah, Matt, what's going on? Deanna. Is obviously a roommate thing. N't want to get in the le of it. Bye Mike. Sorry that I wasn't worth it. Oh, and Matt. This is yours. This is yours. It's game time. Let's go. Let's go. You had sex with her, didn't you? Not now, Mikey. Alright, Fellas. I'm gonna let Richard know you guys are here. Give me a second. Did you? Did you fuck her?! Yes. Game time, fellas. Game time. Game face. Let's go get it. Come on. Let's go get it. Get up. Come on. Come on. Let's go get it. Get up. Come on. Fellas, this is Richard Simpkins. Hello Matthew. .Hello Michael. Mr. Simpkins, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure it is. And I will fulfill my cordial obligation by saying that it is also a pleasure to meet you. If you'll forgive me, I'd like to get straight to the point. I've always felt that chit-chat is for those who have nothing to say. And judging by the content of your script, you seem like you have something to say. It comes to my attention that you as writers and me, as producer... There is a discrepancy about the ending of your picture. Ahh, yes. We I believe .. Well, let me say then that I fully understand you not wanting to change your script. Believe it or not, there are a lot of writers in Hollywood who don't want to alter their work, and that is quite honorable. So, I have decided to go ahead and purchase your movie as is. You won't have to change another word. You won't have to change another word. I want to frame this. You can do whatever you want with it as soon as you sign this contract. Great, let me see it. I can tell you what it says. I'll read it. Thanks. Think about it, Mike. Before you know it, your movie is gonna be coast to coast on the big screen. Can't wait. They own all future rights... What's the matter, Mike? A check not enough for you? You were expecting more zeros, maybe? No... it's plenty of money. We don't get anything once it's made. That's what the checks are for. We have no jurisdiction over any changes. Don't you worry about that. We'll bring in professional writers for that stuff. And Jason and I discussed the ending, Jack's gonna get the girl. But Jack can't get the girl! What if Jack just fucks the girl without telling John? I like that. Jack would never do that. I don't know, Matt. I mean, Jack doesn't show a single human quality throughout the entire script. I don't think anyone would have a problem believing he fucked over his best friend. Yeah, well. It's kind of true. Jack is kind of a dick. If Jack were to fuck the girl, it would only be to protect John. Protect him? That doesn't make any fucking sense, Matt! John is a grown ass man. Okay... Well, we'll deal with this when the time comes. First, if you guys can just sign... Yeah. Th-This is a buyout. We're not even involved in this at all. We don't even have a say over who's in the cast. Oh, we have great idea's for casting. Yeah. We were thinking, uhh, Michael Cera could play John... What? Wow! No! Why? Mike... What? Richard ... What? Mike and I are gonna play John and Jack. You're kidding me right? No. Michael... tell your friend what a good deal he's getting. Man, we got checks. Mike- nobody can play those roles, but us. We wrote this together. You gotta be fucking kidding me! Jason! Don't forget you work for me. And in working for me, you have your place. And right now, that place is on the other side of the door. And right now, that place is on the other side of the door. Hollywood is an interesting place. It is filled with people who feel that they deserve to be handed the glory of fame... and riches simply because they show up in their Von Dutch cap and two hundred dollar jeans. They come in here and they say, "Mr. Simpkins- I want to be a star." Not an actor, or an artist, even, but a "star". "I'll do anything-- I'll do anything to be in one of your pictures, Mr. Simpkins!" And don't think that I haven't, from time to time, taken advantage of these little situations. But the truth be known, my friends, is that I hate Actors. I call them schmactors. You know what I say to these people? These schmactors? I say "Get the fuck out of my office!" They've invaded my city, infested my streets like maggots. And they bite and chew through anything that gets in their way. They are all still willing to lick the sweat from my balls for SAG minimum... ...And two lines in one of my pictures. Take a look at that check. Don't loo... look at the check! Count the zeros if you must. Is that not more money than you have ever seen in your life? So, answer me this question... I'm offering you more money than you have ever seen for ninety pages... Ninety-three. Ninety-three pages... that's not even in the right format! ...But I'm willing to overlook this artistic immaturity. But you have the nerve to think you can be in it too? Who's gonna come to see you? It's the name that sells a movie, not a plot. Nobody knows who you are. And nobody cares, including me. All I want is the ninety-three pages you wrote. A little career advice, boys: Take the money and run, kids. Take it. Jason! Jason! I'll sell it with us attached, and the original ending. The contract stands as is. Sorry. I can't do it. Matt... I'm done. Come on. Sign it. Fuck it. Take my name off the script. It's yours. Okay. Mike- you could earn double. What do you say? Fuck you, Matt. Sorry, Richard. Thank you, but we're a team. If Matt's out, then I'm out. You got to be kidding me?! Sacrifice, gentleman. The things I had to do to break into this business, that I could never tell my mother. ...To get me where I am today. And you two can't even... Bravo. Bravo to you. Great. You get to walk outta here with your pride and integrity in tact. But what you will not walk outta here with is that check. And this is why... In the next five years, I'm going to produce eleven films. They're gonna be nominated for a handful of Oscars. Oh... I'm due. And I will make an incomprehensible amount of money on these films. But you two will get to keep your script. And when five years pass, I will summon you back to this office. I'll offer you half of what I offered you today. And you'll take it, gladly. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Do you know what's coming? Do you feel it? Jason- Wow. What a great meeting. Thanks for wasting my time. Yo, yo, yo- Mikey. Yo, sign the fucking contract, man. Calm down, bro... Yo, Matt- I'm not your bro. I'm not your friend, either. You think it's fun for me to go down to your shitty ass house? Socks all over pretending like Naw, I don't. It's a business. Sign the fucking contract! No. Look at you Mike. You are pathetic. You don't have a god damn thing going for you. You're just another loser who thinks he's too good to play the game. You have one script. No, no- you have half of a script. You do everything this moron tells you to do, and you're a fuckin' team? Fuck him. You're nothing! Nothing. If you had any brains or any balls at all... We don't give a fuck what you think, Jason! How fucking dare you talk to Mike like that. The only reason that you do what you do is 'cause you don't have the talent... ...Or the sack to do what he does. Cept not as goo'Cause children You will never become anything, ever. You are a complete waste of life, you give me gas, ...And I want you to get the fuck outta my way. Aight, then. Gangster. I've got another meeting, anyway. Do you guys have another meeting? Huh? What was that? That's funny. I would have thought you had. Listen, Mike... I don't get it. E too good to change the script. An't change one fucking No matter how bad we need the money. You've got too much integrity. Well, where was your God damn integrity when you decided to fuck my girlfriend? You sit there and talk all this, zen bullshit, like you're fucking Yoda... Joseph Campbell. ...and then go behind my back? You fuckin' dirty, peice of shit, fuckin' ass-... N-No, Mike! Mike! Mike... Mike... Mikey! Mikey! Get off me! I'm done, Matt. No, I'm done. I'm going home! Alright? And nothing you can say will ever make this ok. I did it for you! What? I did it for you, man. That girl is bad for you. She's always been bad for you. I just thought that, if you could bang her, you would feel better. ...But you couldn't. You said you wanted to give her a reason to never come back, but you couldn't. That was the only thing I thought I could do to get her out of your life, ...So that you could move on. I thought there was no way that she would come back after that. ...But she came back! How could you think I could do something like that to you? I mean I did, but I didn't. Mikey, please don't-- just don't go, man. You're the only person I know. What would I do? So you thought the best way to keep me around, and to keep me happy was ...having sex with my girlfriend? Matt, what the fuck is the matter with you? You knew what had happened before... and how it affected me... an-and-... I'm sorry, Mike. I don't understand why she would do that. Hell hath no fury, bro. It's kinda funny if you think about it. Or not funny. No, it's not funny. It's not at all. Should we have taken the money? No. Maybe. Hey, thanks for NOT taking the money. Remember when you yelled at Jason in Richard Simpkins's office? Yeah. I wanted to punch him in the throat. I liked how you used that monologue you wrote. What should we put it in? What would it work in? In this. In this? Yeah, yeah- we should write about this. Its a fucked up story. People would be interested in it. Okay? I mean, we'd have to change it a little. Yeah. Edit out some unimportant details... Of course. Write in a few really hot chicks. Obviously. How do we start it? We? Yeah, we. I'm not writing this shit alone. It was your idea. Alright. About what? I don't know... about dogs. No one is gonna buy that. Real people dont have conversations about dogs. That's not true, we're conversing about a dog right now. No we're not, we're conversing about writing a script with a conversation about dogs. Totally different. Same difference. Alright. Fine, Matt. How would said conversation about dogs, begin?
