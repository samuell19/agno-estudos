The pit was deep or she fell slowly because while she fell she had time to look around and wonder what would happen next. Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland Mellie. Mellie. ls that the bus from Marseille? Yes, Mother. Surely not. lt never stops here. What are you looking at? ls there a passenger? Yes. Did he come on the bus? He can't have done. That bus never brings anyone here. The rain must have brought him, then. RIDER ON THE THE RAIN Tuesday, 10 October, 5pm That's the third in ten minutes. l smoke to give you something to say to me. l have to go and get my dress. OK, l'm done. There are five that need repairing. - What's wrong with that one? - lt keeps turning over. lt can't do. You don't know what you're doing. Go ahead, tell me l drink too much. You drink too much. l drink to forget. Forget what? That men are pigs. When are you bringing back my mended cars? - Day after tomorrow. - Not tomorrow? Tomorrow l'm going to a wedding. Your husband hates you seeing me. No, he just hates me coming here. Besides, you're invited. My own wedding was quite enough for me. - Good night, Mother. - Good night, sweetheart. They can keep trying to get to the moon or Mars or wherever, but since there's nobody there, why bother? - Did you get my bread? - Yes. lt's over there. - Do you think this dress is too short? - No. Let me try it on with your shoes. Doesn't he like short dresses? Not on me. ls he coming back tomorrow? Tony? Tonight. He's meant to be bringing me a record from London. Wait till you hear it, it's bestial! How can a record be bestial? l'm flat broke - Police station, please. - Your number? Hello? 1 8, Cap des Pins. One moment, please. Police station. Hello? Speak up. Hello? Who is this? - ls that 18, Cap des Pins? - Yes. - Did you talk to the police? - Yes, thank you. Don't hang up, you have a call from London. Go ahead, sir. Mellie? Tony. - ls that you, Tony? - Of course it's me. Aren't you coming back tonight? Yes, we're taking off in 20 minutes. l'll be home around 11. ls something the matter? Yes. No, nothing. lt doesn't sound like nothing. Tony... Can l pick you up at the airport? No, a friend's picking me up. - Tony, let me come. - l said no. - But why? - You're a hopeless driver. Listen, poppet, l assure you, it's not worth it. - Hurry back. - Are you angry? - Hurry back! - See you later, poppet. Come out of there! Go away! l won't tell anybody. l won't press charges. You heard me on the phone. l didn't say anything. No one will know. Please. Just go away! Police. Road check. Your papers, please. ls that you, Mellie? lt's Mrs Mau. l went to school with her husband. Are you alone? - Where are you going? - To the airport, to pick up Tony. The reason l ask is, we're looking for somebody, a real nutcase. l wouldn't want you to run into him, that's all. You didn't see anybody on the road? - No. - OK. Be careful. Good night, Mellie. OK. ls that you, Mellie? Yes, it's me. Have you seen the time? Where were you? - Tony, please. - l'm asking you where you were! l went to see my mother. She went to see her mother. She went to see her mother! lt's true, l went to see my mother. But l had problems. - With the car. - What kind of problems? - With the starter. - You don't know what a starter is. A driver fixed it for me. He told me. Where? On the road to La Madrague. Your mother didn't see you on her way over. l didn't come that way. Do you know what my father would have done if my mother had ever left the house at this time of night? He would have given her a head like that! For sure. He would have given her head like that! l never saw my old man cook, touch a pan, or anything like that. You see this egg? Are you listening? She would never have let him even break an egg! She'd have been ashamed! - Your mother was a saint. - You can say that again. Mellie wasn't that lucky. ls that your dress for tomorrow? Yes, l wanted to show it to Mother. What do you think of it? lt's dirty. l'll wash it. That's easy. And there's a button missing. Now where are you going? To check the stove. Wednesday - Noon Hold each other's right hand. l now declare you man and wife in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Hear us, O Lord, who made Heaven and Earth. Lord, hear our prayers. May our prayers reach Thee... BODY FOUND ON THE BEACH Bless, O Lord, these rings in Thy name, so that those who wear them may live in faithfulness. May they live in peace, obeying God's will. May they live in everlasting love. ln the name of Christ our Lord, amen. Why did you kill him? What do l get for a correct answer? Nothing, but l get to gain time. Not a very profitable game. Does it call for mathematics? What? Mathematics. l'm a wiz at maths. lt's just an American watch, that's all. What did you think? That you're an American. That's all. Are you afraid of Americans? No, of watches. Where do you live? All over the place. Why didn't you stay there? l followed that age-old urge. Chercher la femme! Are you with the police? Me? No. Then you are out of luck. l've already got a man. Sorry, l have to go. l don't have a car. l'm told you might take me back. Back where? We're going to Cap des Pins. That's exactly where l'm going. My name is Dobbs, Harry Dobbs. Have you been here long? Since this morning. Where are you staying? At the Palm Hotel. The Palm Hotel is closed. Not for me. l have a nice light room with red curtains. Are you here on business? You could call it that. What kind of business? Hunting. Hunting? There's nothing to hunt round here. That depends on what you're hunting. You never found that lost button? l'll ask Nicole for another. Right. This is your stop. The Palm Hotel's miles away. We're not going that way. lsn't it enough? Yes. When will you be back? Saturday at noon. You're taking a lot of money with you. That's my business. Where are you going? - Djibouti. - And then where? Cairo and Rome. - What's Djibouti like? - Like the rest. What's the matter, Tony? Was Harry Dobbs the guy who fixed your car? Who? The American. You'd never seen him before? Why are you like this, Tony? Why are you so jealous? A man who is not jealous is not a man. What have l done now? l saw you dancing with him. Do you know what my father used to say? To my mother? lf anybody looks at you, you tell me. lf anybody touches you, l'll kill him. Give that to me. l'll brush it. l'll never dance with anybody again. l promise. All right. l want to drive you to the airport tomorrow. All right. Thursday - 1 1 am How much do you bet l can beat you? l've never done any bowling. Who was talking about bowling? How did you get in? Through the door. First l went to your house. There was nobody there, but l knew where you were. You were driving your husband to the airport. And another thing. lt took you 45 minutes too long to come back. l can also tell you why. You stopped to read the newspapers. Too bad there was nothing about the body they found yesterday morning. What do you want from me? Talk. We said it all yesterday. Yesterday l hadn't seen your house. lt's really fancy. Your husband is a pilot with Air France, isn't he? He's a navigator. Say, a navigator must do pretty well. How much is he making? What do you want to talk to me about? Let's talk about the man you saw get off the bus. Your mother told me. True, l saw a stranger get off the bus. But l hardly noticed him. But you saw him again later. That's not true. You were undressed in a shop, trying on a dress. And he was on the pavement, outside the shop window. He was staring at you. A peeping Tom. Your friend Nicole told me that. You know Nicole? l've met many people since l arrived here. You told me you weren't a policeman. Why are you so interested in that man? l thought you said you were good at maths. - That man is very interesting. - Not to me. l didn't know he'd get killed or that l'd be questioned. Or anything. That's true, but please make an effort. When that man was outside the shop, looking at you, was he holding anything in his hands? You know very well. You lie all the time. Did you really forget about the red bag? Do you really not know what happened to it? l don't want to know. What do l care about this man? You were the last person to see him. l've asked everybody in the village. And? There's only one explanation. You took him home in your car. Nobody goes anywhere around here without wheels. You do. l've got a car. You didn't have one yesterday. l said that l didn't have one. lt's the red one. l really like red. Hey, that cost me money. l'll give it back to you. Go away. l'll find that red bag, Mellie. There aren't many places he could have hidden it. lf the bag is not at your home, perhaps it's in a locker at the railway station. Leave me in peace. Not before l've found that bag. Not one minute before. Believe me, Mellie. lt's better for you if l find it before the police do. Are you leaving, Mellie? l saw your car outside. - l want to ask you something. - Yes? Well, it is about... ...the poker game at your place when Tony's back on Saturday. l've lost a lot this winter. l'd rather tell you because Tony will listen to you. Besides, with you it's easier. The thing is... l need a loan. lf Tony doesn't mind. l don't want to bother anyone. No problem, l'll tell him. And l'm sure he won't mind. Thanks, Mellie. The man they found dead yesterday on the beach used to be a boxer. Bruno Sacchi. - Hadn't you heard? - l saw the papers yesterday. lt wasn't mentioned today. lt won't be until they get the murderess. Murderess? Yes, they already know it's a woman. They've got their ways, l'm telling you. OK, see you on Saturday, Mellie, and thank you. Everybody lies. When l speak, l'm never sure if l really mean what l say. l was just looking for you. No kidding. You said you'd leave me in peace once you'd got the bag. - Well, here it is. - Hang on. The owner of this bag came to see you at your home, Mellie. That's not true. Oh, l can't leave you alone now. This is your address, isn't it? Give me back that photo. lt's worth a lot of money to me. l'm hungry, Mellie. lnvite me for breakfast. ls that for me? Americans feed on ketchup and milk, don't they? l'm a wiz at geography. Mellie. What's Mellie short for? Melancholy. They wanted to call me Melanie after my grandma, but when my father went to register me, he said: ''No, not Melanie, don't put Melanie.'' To save crossing it out, they called me Melancholy. Eat it before it gets cold. l like your father. He left when l was nine. He never came back. And what's that? A present. From friends of Tony's, from Hong Kong or wherever. Tony must have friends all over the place. Right? When was this picture taken, Love Love? Show me and l'll tell you. l think it was last year. But that doesn't mean Tony knew this Bruno Sacchi. You seemed to know his name all right. l just heard it. l'm sure he was no friend of your husband. Otherwise, why would he need a photo? lmpeccable psychology. l'm a wiz at psychology. Only in some matters, you don't need insight. Staying out of sight, out of mind works perfectly. Sacchi didn't came here on business last Tuesday. That's for sure. Whatever happened when he found you at home alone is for you to tell me. Would you like a coffee before you go? l'm not going anywhere. l have all the time in the world. You don't think... you're going to stay here, do you? Where would you like me to go? To the police? Why are you doing this to me? A man has to make a living. And what would you gain from me seeing two, three or four Mr Dobbs? You'll end up choosing one of them as your confessor. Drink, Love Love. There are people in the next house. They'll hear me if l scream. Go ahead. l checked this morning. There's nobody. Just like Tuesday night when you killed him. That's not true. l won't drink it. Who's asking you to drink it? Just tell me what happened on Tuesday night. Drink, Mellie, l hate having to repeat myself. lf you do that once more, l'll spank you. You'll what? l'll put you over my knee, pull your pants down and give you a good spanking. All of it. Nice place you've got here. Tony certainly knows how to live well. Sailors and aviators have got it good. A girl in every port, a trick in every airport. l know Tony. And l know Sacchi. Go on, ask me about him. That'll make you thirsty. He was an interesting case for a psychiatrist. A liar, a thief, a sadist and a sex maniac. But he had his good points. The trick with the nuts, for instance. He taught me some things about nut throwing. You try. Hard. You're in love, Love Love When the pane breaks, that means you're in love. Get out. Tony had nothing to do with any Sacchis or Harry Dobbs. There's a name for what you're doing. Withholding evidence. Blackmail. l'm the one who's going to the police. Do you hear me? l'm going to the police. l'm going to the police. What was Bruno Sacchi's racket? l am not an information centre. Please, answer me, Mr Dobbs. All Tony brings back from his trips are things for the house. Or records, for our friend. You can't hide anything in a record sleeve, can you? Nicole. Oh, it's you, Mellie. Just a second. What's the matter, Mellie? Double crosser. What's your racket with my husband? l'm glad you know because l want it to stop it. l've slept with Tony. Do you want to know what l was? l was just his one-night stand for a couple of nights. But l swear, Mellie, it was a brief affair. lt never meant a thing to Tony. lt was my fault. l don't know what came over me. lt only happened twice! What did you learn from your friend Nicole? Nothing of interest to you, Mr Dobbs. Tony's been cheating on me with her. But l don't care. So what's the money for? Because l'm not sure of anything any more. Please, give me that photo. lt's all l had in my account. l have housekeeping money at home. l'll give you that. l've bought a bottle. lt's only fair that you pay for it since you're the one who's going to drink it. Do you like it? My mother says it helps you to forget. Forget what? That men are pigs. She should know. She's a wiz on alcohol and unfaithfulness. Only, she's the one who cheated on my father. Go on then, Mr Dobbs, pick it up. Murder doesn't come cheap, Love Love. l'm just paying for my husband's peace of mind. Nothing more. You must be kidding. What he's got to worry about? Until he comes back, l have no idea. l'm buying time, Mr Dobbs. You pick it up. Pick up your money and keep it! Do l look like the type to take a woman's housekeeping money? l don't understand. l'm no blackmailer. So, who are you? l'm your partner, Love Love. For more than a week l've been chasing Sacchi. l've been searching for him all over the country and most of Germany. Why? To kill him. lmagine my surprise when l arrived here yesterday morning. The job was already done for me. Only, it was an amateur job. l would have grabbed everything he had on him. Do you have any idea what our partnership is worth? Name a price, Love Love. 60,000 dollars in 1 0 and 20 dollar notes. That's how much room that would take up. But the police didn't find any money on the body? No, and it wasn't in the bag, either. And l know you don't have it. So? So you're going to tell me exactly how you killed him. l'll take care of the rest. l've never killed anybody. l've wasted too much time with you. Enough of this! lt's almost six. The clock in the hall is about to strike. You have until the clock's last stroke to tell me you killed him, or else... l will kill you. l swear l'm telling the truth. So am l. l don't believe you. Nor do l. Bravo. You must have noticed that it wasn't loaded. You really deserve a drink, Love Love. On the rocks. How did you get to Cap des Pins? l talked to the bus driver. And why did you go to the wedding? Your friend Nicole told me you'd be there. She's not a friend. She's a drum. A what? When l want to say a rude word, l say drum. Perhaps Sacchi no longer had the money on him? He paid his bus fare with this. That proves nothing. Bring your glass. l want to prove something to you. There are two cartridges missing from the box in this drawer. That's news to me. l searched the whole house while you were at the airport. Two cartridges are missing. That's news to me. You bought another box and replaced them. Finish your drink. And it's easy to see that this rifle has been used recently. An expert would say it was the day before yesterday. Go on, tell me that's not true. lt's true. So you admit it? The day before yesterday l shot some rats in the cellar. Rats! Come this way. Come on, Love Love. Rats, right? You shot rats? This high up? They were jumping. Listen, Love Love, even for the dumbest cop, that would constitute a proof. But l'm not a cop, l'm a future millionaire. Tell me the truth. What are you doing? Shooting a future millionaire. And l'm not waiting for the clock to strike. Don't move. Don't move. Give me your pistol, please, Mr Dobbs. l did not kill Sacchi. Now, where is your proof? Pull up your shirt. Pull it up! Who did that? Tony hit me last night. Tony? Why? He saw me dancing with you. Drum. Tony's back tonight. He'll beat you up. He knows how to fight. So do l. Tony is far away and won't be back until the day after tomorrow. You won't last that long, Love Love. The day my father left, l found a coin on the floor. The door was bolted, so we got a neighbour to break in. His room was an unspeakable mess. My father had even taken the mattress cover with him. Yes, the mattress cover. That's true, Mr Dobbs. But why did he leave? Because l saw my mother sleeping with another man. l couldn't care less. But my father started to ask me questions and questions and questions. l couldn't stand it any more. So l told him. Then he left. No one calls me Melancholy any more. Yes, l know. lt's my fault. l get it, Love Love. You confessed once before and it didn't work out. That's why you won't confess any more. lf l'd killed that man, l'd have gone straight to the police. Not after what he'd done to you. Women who are subjected to that don't go to the police. More psychology? No, statistics. Who's coming to save me, Mr Dobbs? Don't know. Mellie? Mellie, l know you're here. You have to listen to me. l'm sorry. l thought you'd be alone. Mellie is busy tonight. This house looks like my life. Only two days ago, everything was in order. Now, l'm breaking down doors, shooting guns in the cellar, drinking bottles, kissing... anybody. Do you know why l kissed you, Mr Dobbs? Because you're in love with me. Bravo. You're going to tell me you kissed me to upset Nicole. That's partly true, but there's something else. You don't want anybody else to poke their nose in. Or anybody else to know about it. Love Love? Friday - 1 0am Did you take my cars in to be repaired? Brm-brm. My cars. l forgot. - Where are they? - ln the boot. - l'll take them today. - No, l'll do it myself. At least then it will get done. ls this yours? Are you collecting them? United States embassy, confidential l only let women into my room for one reason, and l decide who. You searched my house. You stole a photo of my husband and put it in that bag. Besides, that bag is yours. You left in the station locker. You set this whole thing up. Tony had nothing to do with it. Exactly. But if you know that, it means you found the other red bag, the real one. No, l just figured it out. Now l know who you are. Colonel Dobbs. A cop. Not a cop. Let's just say l'm running a parallel investigation. Why? ln the army nobody asks why. l have to find out the truth and send a report. That's all. And you're going to tell me the truth. Let me make it easier for you. l'll tell you what happened. Tuesday night a stranger attacked you in your own home. He had a stocking over his head. You tried to defend yourself but all of a sudden he hit you like this! You see. And now l'll tell you what he did. He always stays in the house afterwards. l know what he's like. l've read his file. You found him in the cellar and killed him. l can prove it. You called the police station but you hung up without saying anything. The switchboard told me. You put the body in the car but you came up against a road block. The police told me at the police station. You told the police you were picking up your husband at the airport. But that wasn't true. Your mother told me that. lmpossible. My mother never tells. Let me ask you something, Mr Dobbs. lf you know everything and you have all the proof, why all this play acting? You must be missing an important piece of the puzzle. Which piece, Mr Dobbs? Bravo! l didn't kill him, Mr Dobbs. An innocent woman is being accused. They've arrested Sacchi's mistress. That's not true. They are down at the beach where the body was found. Go and see for yourself. lf she's innocent, she's not in danger. Don't bet on it. Even her friends are after blood. Do you know why? They think she's got the 60,000 dollars. What beach? Do you think the body drifted? l don't think anything. l know nothing. A place called La Peluque. - Toussaint? - Yes. - l need to tell you something. - Sorry, Mellie, not a good time. - Who is that woman? - The victim's mistress. She rented a house here. Her name's Madeleine Legauff. - Does she still live round here? - They brought her here from Paris. She was a waitress at the Eiffel Tower. - Why has she been arrested? - She was here when he was murdered. Say, Mellie, you seem very interested in this affair? Go away. Stop staring at me. Do you hear me? Go away. Watch out! Mrs Melancholy Mau, arriving from Marseille-Marignane, please proceed to the information desk. l'm here to meet Tania Legauff. l know. Give me your bag and your coat. No, l'll keep them. Do as l say. Follow me. Tania Legauff? Was it you who called me? Yes. How did you find me? l went to the Eiffel Tower. Then to a photographer's studio. He gave me your number. But l have very little time, l have a plane to catch. You went to great lengths to see me. Last night your sister was arrested. l know that she's not guilty. So what? What do you mean, so what? She's your sister. So what? l want them to set her free. Do you understand? l want her to be set free! My sister is very lucky. l don't understand what you're on about. Sit down. Tell me who you are. Give me your hand. Do you know what it means, when a girl bites her nails? Don't be like that. lt's hardly a sin. l didn't come here to talk about sins. When people bite their nails... lt's not what you think. lt means they haven't quite grown up and that they let themselves get carried away by their imagination. Where was your sister on Tuesday night? She was here, as usual. Here? ln Paris? Why didn't you tell the police? Do you think l want the police here? Well? No... First, l need to know where l am. Who did your sister spend Tuesday night with? People. l want to see those people. That's easy. Here she is. l feel like l'm playing with dolls. These days they make talking dolls. What does this one say? She asks questions. Now, where were we? Her father left, taking the mattress cover with him. So she took a plane with 60,000 dollars in an envelope. Where is that envelope? l posted it. Who to? To myself. At Cap des Pins. Shall we cut her head off? You came to Paris by plane to send yourself an envelope at Cap des Pins? ls that it? No. Two Americans were tailing me at Orly. l had to get rid of that money. Why were those men following you? Because of Harry Dobbs. Harry Dobbs? May l know who this new character is? An American colonel. What l don't get is what you have to do... ...with Sacchi. Can you describe him to us? He was very tall. ls that all? Bring me my coat. l want to show you something. lf the pane breaks, it means you're in love. He said that. Follow me, please. Where is she? Where is she? l don't know what you mean. Tell him to drop it. That's enough. Leave me be and l'll leave you be. All right. l'm really glad to see you, Mr Dobbs. Me too, Love Love. Since you really exist, Mr Dobbs, perhaps you could explain this game we're playing. l haven't seen Mr Sacchi for over a year. What did she come here for? lt's all a misunderstanding. And l'm responsible for it. Will that be all, sir? Yes, thank you. No, bring some coffee up at eight. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You have to get home before your husband, Love Love. l'll take you back. Are you listening? Saturday - 8am You should eat a bit. l heard what you said. lt's my job, Love Love. - Do you normally live here? - l live in Germany. But everywhere looks like this room. l saw a photo of a little boy in your suitcase. ls he yours? Yes. Are you married? No, l'm single. Are you really so sure you'll win, Mr Dobbs? You shouldn't use that word. l didn't kill him. Thank you. Can you dress yourself? You came to meet me. l wanted to talk to you. Before you see the house. l've had a quarrel with Mother. A dreadful quarrel. She even broke a door. A door? Why? Because of my father. A door can be fixed. - l have to leave again tonight. - Oh, no. Afraid so. Good morning. Thank you. - That's all. - Goodbye. Pass. 5,000. - l'm in. - 1 5. 30 No. - Stick. - Show. Pay 30. Melancholy Mau. You're sending yourself letters now. You know your name, Melancholy? l've always liked it, too. But l was saving it for when you grow up. What are you saying? Nothing. Here, this came for you. - That's your writing, isn't it? - What time is it? You've been asleep all afternoon. ls this the door that l broke? l must be strong. Did you tell Tony it's not true? What do you think? - You getting so forgetful. - What have l done now? Toussaint asked you to talk to Tony about a loan. Drum! l completely forgot - ls he angry? - No, tonight he's in a good mood. The woman they arrested has confessed everything. Hello, Mellie. lt's warm, isn't it? l'm really sorry. l completely forgot. Don't worry, l'm winning today. Thank you. She didn't look guilty. Listen, Mellie. She killed her lover for money and buried him at La Peluque. End of story. - Buried him? - Yes. - But when? - Last year. But Colonel Dobbs said... l must have misunderstood. Dobbs is on another case. He's after an escapee from an army hospital in Germany. After three rape convictions, this time he just made off with the petty cash. ls there any more beer? Will there be an inquiry? An inquiry into what? Dobbs is convinced this loony got killed round here. But there's no body. l made a bet with him that he's still on the run. - ls there no more beer? - l'll get some. Strange, these Americans. They're looking for a recent body so they ask for dogs from Toulon. Then they find an old one. lsn't that strange? Yes. l was right, Love Love. He was hidden in your car. Only you didn't know. l hate you. You're a liar and a cheat. You had nothing on me. You planned all this, with your Cheshire cat grin. You're the one who caused the confusion. When l saw you staring at that newspaper at the church, l knew l'd win. Never. You've led me to McGuffin. Who? Your victim. His name is McGuffin. l'm sure he's there. l'm going to have it dredged. l just wanted to get some air. Even if you find him, you can't prove anything. Love Love. What about that bag you are holding? lsn't that proof? What bag? l have no bag. They're leaving. l'll stay here tonight if you like. No. l'm a bit tired, that's all. Mellie... What have l done now? Nothing, darling. What's the matter? That's Toussaint leaving. His siren is stuck. l'm leaving for London tonight. Why don't you stay with her? - No, she's going with you. - With me? What's the occasion? l know Melancholy. She'll have come up with an occasion before l reach the gate. She's a wiz at it. l'll honk my horn at the gate. Listen, sweetheart, this is crazy. Crazy or not, take me with you. l want to be with you. l have things... to tell you... in London. He was caught on the rocks, wouldn't have surfaced for months. You've won our bet, Colonel. lf he raped a girl from round here and someone killed him, you're off to a bad start. Why? Because... he can't talk now so we'll never know what happened. You'll know when you read my report. Did you finish your job? l have the money and the body. l have enough to write my report. You can't have it all, can you? Besides, stirring things up won't do anyone any good. McGuffin has taken the truth with him. You should let your nails grow, Love Love. Farewell. Mr Dobbs... Just now my mother called me Melancholy. That's great.
