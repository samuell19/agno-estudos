[DlVINE'S "GOOD AND PLENTY" PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS] [WOMAN CHUCKLES] That I'm the one That's gonna show you love I'll give you good and plenty of it So beautiful. [RUMBLING] WOMAN 1 : What's that? -Did you feel something? -Yeah, I feel something. Shh. Heh, heh. MAN: Hey, get back here! WOMAN 2: Whoo! Turn up the music! Oh, yeah We're having a party, man. Yeah, you guys are having fun. Boat's rocking. [RUMBLING] -Shh, shh. -Shh. Whoa, heh, heh. WOMAN 2: Stop! MAN: You're paranoid! WOMAN 2: Listen. [RUMBLING] Yeah. Okay. Did you hear that? Listen, listen. MAN: You hear that? -What's that? Everybody, shh. Shh. Stay up there. What is that? [SCREAMlNG] WOMAN: Come on! [GUNSHOT] Okay, we've had some problems at the facility. What we're attempting to achieve has never been done. We're this close to the reactivation of a human brain cell. The 200 million I've given this company is due in great part to your research. But when the market opens Monday... ...despite my reputation, I don't like heights. Especially falling from them. I'm sorry, honestly. Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known anyone with Alzheimer's? Well, no. By the end, all my father could do was ask why my mother wasn't at home. Each time l said she was dead, I watched him take the loss like a car wreck. 200,000 men and women develop Alzheimer's each year. What if you could end all that suffering with a single pill? Give me till Monday morning. Forty-eight hours. My results will skyrocket your stock price... ...or l'll help you pack the lab myself. It's your call. That was an impressive speech you gave back there. SUSAN: I read that article on you. -The thing in the Himalayas. -Alps. Right. We were just trying to do something together. Having fun. Things went bad. But you saved all those people. Not all. SUSAN: Navy built it for WWll submarine loading... ...refueling. When they mothballed it, we picked it up, added aquatic pens, underwater labs. Your dime, l guess. Looks like Alcatraz floats. [WORKER & CARTER SPEAKlNG IN SPANlSH] What do you think? She's a 1 2-footer. She's beautiful. -She wants to give you a big kiss. -l bet. She's got a license plate jammed in her mouth. It's a good deal, amigo. [SPEAKS IN SPANlSH] Drop her, Billy! Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins. Marine biologist. Jan will get you settled. Welcome to our island paradise. Where's Tattoo? You know, short guy? [IN FRENCH ACCENT] "The plane, boss! The plane!" Right. [IN NORMAL VOICE] I am getting old. How much do you know about our facility? Treat me like a tourist. I hate tourists and I've decided I like you. [LOCK BEEPS] Hey! "Louisiana." Probably bought in a pet shop in Baton Rouge. Ate everything in his tank, and then the guy that bought him. Next day, fills up the cab of the guy's truck with water and drives to Baja... ...picking bones out of his teeth with the license plate. We need to talk. Later. Carter Blake, Russell Franklin, president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals. Whoa. That was incredible. Actually, they don't like the taste of us very much. They bite you, it's because they think you're a fat little seal. Or a rich suit. Nice meeting you. Friendly place. You got full sentences. Usually, he just kind of nods. Word travels fast about why you're here and all. Was that the Gen One that escaped? That little guy? No way. Those are the normals. These are the test sharks. Two first-generation and one second-generation female. Beneath its glassy surface... ...a world of gliding monsters. It's pretty scary stuff, huh? Yes. lt is. WOMAN [OVER PA]: Tower to water taxi. Tower to water taxi. Ben, l'm picking up a nasty little bitch of a squall about 30 miles out. Over. MAN [OVER RADlO]: Copy that. We'll be all right. [JOHNNY NASH'S "I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW" PLAYlNG] I can see clearly now Jan, stay out of the rain. Where are they going? They hate me too? Oh. They're going home. We run a skeleton crew on the weekend. But they probably hate you anyway. There's Dr. Jim Whitlock, the most brilliant man ever. He's pissing into the wind. How brilliant can he be? You'll see. -lt's gonna be a bright -Bright -Bright -Bright sunshine-y day -lt's gonna be a bright -Bright TOM: What happened? You miss with the first shot? It took two hits to even slow it down. Are you kidding? Two of these things should've killed it. Tell it that, Scoggs. You missed. Don't get mad at me because you can't shoot worth a shit. If you hadn't left the pen open, I could've got a good night's sleep. I already told the doc, l locked the pen like l do every other night. -The fish got out some other way. -Huh. Huh. What are you looking at me like that for? Who you gonna trust? Me, that's who. You trust me. You know why? Because l'm trustworthy. How high are these fences off the water? Given the surface variations and tensile strength-- Scoggs. Short answer, man. Eight feet, give or take a centimeter. JANICE: l'm sorry. l'm making Aquatica sound like a mental hospital. FRANKLIN: No, not really. Well, heh, heh, maybe a little. The truth is, it is. But almost everyone here is top of their game. Living below is like living in space. You don't get very many mistakes. Besides the catwalks... ...you bought us titanium-based fencing around all the lagoon and pens. There are three sub-levels. Sub-level One is living quarters. Two: Wet lab and workshops. And Three: Engineering and air-locked wet entry. Welcome to Aquatica. [RUMBLING] Did you dose the Gen Two with the serum? I had Carter do it after you called. It should be ready tomorrow night. -But? -We will not be ready. Two months ahead of schedule. We're skipping three rounds of preliminary trials. SUSAN: No choice. You wait your whole life for a single moment... ...and then one day, it's tomorrow. FRANKLIN: So what exactly does a shark wrangler do? CARTER: Pretty much what it sounds like, l guess. How'd you end up here at Aquatica? CARTER: I like the water. Pay's good. Hey, an AGA mask. Did some wreck diving in one of these, off the coast of Spain. Tourist thing. CARTER: Mm-hm. Do you like wreck diving? It's okay. I bet you're good at it. We're on the water. Whole cat-and-mouse thing don't float. -You're the man, right? -Yeah. Yeah, l'm the man. The man's always got a file. What's it say? Two years, Leavenworth. Smuggling. How'd you make your money? You the first rich guy in history who's squeaky-clean? You do understand my concern, right? Look, l got a workable deal here. I don't make waves. I meet the terms of my parole. I'm not out to change the world, like the doc. I'm not out to wreck it either. [OVER SPEAKERS] Money, money make the world go round WOMAN'S VOICE: Eat me, asshole! ln and out of town Rolling over here Hey, you dickhead! Now, what you hear is what you get Coming from the kingpins ln the wild, wild West [PARROT SQUAWKS] PARROT: Fat butt! You got a big fat butt. You know what, bird? You're trying my last nerve. Don't make me drown your feathery ass. Get myself a cat. That's good. Yes. That's good. Mm. That's it. You got a nasty-looking tongue, you know that? Talking 'bout Talking 'bout money [METAL CREAKING AND RUMBLlNG] Feeding time. TOM [OVER RADlO]: I'm releasing the tiger shark in 30 seconds. Copy. CARTER: I hear you. I'm going in. You guys hungry? Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here. Could you please come to surface level? [OVER RADlO] Dr. McAlester, could you come to surface level, please? Hello? [GUNSHOT] Surprise! Happy birthday! [LAUGHlNG] [OVER SPEAKERS] Gold, pearls and diamond rings All expensive, shinin' things Damn, l hate that song. You like the tunes there, Preach? And when the cash don't shine They close their eyes for life Carter, join us. There's too much woman on this deck for Scoggs to handle. FRANKLIN: Vodka, straight. And by the way, food was excellent, brother. You're that guy that got caught in that avalanche, right? Yeah. l'm the one. Black men have enough ways to get killed... ...without climbing up some mountain in the middle of nowhere. You need to leave that to the white folks, "brother." Happy birthday? I'll let you know tomorrow. How's life underwater? Well, it's a lot less complicated... ...than it is on the surface. That's for sure. Nice work with that new tiger shark today. You'll have to tell me how you learned that. One day, you'll take me up on that beer and maybe l will. It's all work for me, Carter. But, like you said, "one day." Sharks never get cancer, go blind or show loss of brain activity as they age. Unlike some people l know. Sharks are the oldest creatures on the planet... ...from a time when the world was just flesh and teeth. JANICE: By using a hormonal enhancer... ...we increased this female's forebrain to five times its normal size. To harvest more protein. Exactly. A protein that may reactivate-- That will. --that will reactivate human brain cells stored in the forebrain of the shark. I'm just amazed that we've come so far, so fast, without genetic tampering. Genetic engineering to increase brain mass violates the Harvard Compact. Not to mention Chimera policy. They're hunting in packs. Like wild dogs. They'll only eat other sharks. You're reading too much into it. That Gen One attacked a 25-foot boat. Am l reading too much into that too? Did you tell Franklin? I'm just a fish keeper, lady. But bringing in that shark ahead of schedule was a very bad idea. Do you like your job? Are you threatening me, doc? No. But if we don't pull off that test tomorrow, we're all on the street. You're a good man, Carter. But with your background.... Ah. Right. How's Miss Smarty-Pants? Hope she's not as dumb as she seems. Raise those fences like l asked? I took care of it. Let's go get a beer. [THUNDER CRASHES] MAN [OVER RADlO]: U.S. Coast Guard advisories include: All craft warnings for waters south of the U.S. mainland and west of CA. A tropical depression is generating gale-force winds... ...and is associated with heavy rains and ocean swells to 30 feet or more. Repeat: U.S. Coast Guard advisories.... [OVER SPEAKERS] With the writing on the wall [PARROT SQUAWKS] Any of your nonsense, and we'll have tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight. Fat butt! PREACH: That's right. You can...all you want. Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin. Wow. Wet lab, we're taking a pounding up here. Can't see past my nose. [OVER RADlO] So I suggest you check pen monitors and lagoon monitors. I can't imagine there's much visibility below. Carter, you copy? Carter? CARTER [OVER RADIO]: Okay, I'm approaching the tunnel. TOM: Bingo. Elvis has left the building. We picked you up, but visibility's near zero. CARTER: No problem. How long have they been synchronized like this? Tell me I didn't see that. They recognized that gun! That's impossible. Sharks can't swim backwards! -Try to stay focused. TOM: What was that? We lost picture in Gen Two pen. Okay, hold on. Carter, do you copy? TOM: Carter, talk to me, man. Do you copy? Cut the crap! You're scaring everybody. Carter! TOM: Boarding platform engaged. He's got her. Did someone order the fish? What in God's creation...? No, not his. Ours. Commencing scan. Gen Two is online. Transferring exotics to remote terminals. Vital signs to terminal one. Diagnostic imaging to terminal two. We're live and in color! JANICE: BP, 67 over 43. Heart rate, 50 B.P.M. Within norms. She's sleeping like a baby. Okay. Bad dreams? In position. Vitals are stable. Vitals? -Holding. -Aspirating 4.5 cc's. Introducing 2 cc's of the protein complex... ...into cultured, inactive brain neurons of an Alzheimer's patient. And what you're looking for here is lightning in a bottle. Protein complex is interacting with the neurons. Neurons are becoming hyperosmotic. Membrane integrity's improving. They're firing! -They're firing! -One second. Two. Three. -Still firing. -Four. Five. Six. 6.560 seconds. I'll be damned. No, sir. For 6.560 seconds... ...you saw what it's like not to be damned. Ha, ha, ha. Congratulations. SUSAN: lmpressed? FRANKLIN: Overly impressed. SUSAN: 6.560 seconds. FRANKLIN: Now that you've got this... ...how long before you make something permanent? JlM: You did it, pal. You did it. [JIM SCREAMS] No! Jim! Carter, no! [ALARM WAILING] Are you insane? Tower, we need paramedics and evac now! BRENDA: All frequencies, SOS. [OVER RADlO] This is Research Station Aquatica. We have a medical emergency. I repeat: This is Research Station Aquatica. We have a medical emergency. Please respond. X-ray Alpha 2-1 8. Coming off oil platform Chiapa. We'll take that post you've always wanted. SUSAN: Got it. He's hemorrhaging! JANICE: They say the yellow butterflies are thick as clouds there, remember? MAN [OVER RADlO]: Research Station Aquatica, this is X-ray Alpha 2-1 8. Have you in sight. Approaching from 0-6-0. Copy, 2-1 8. Stay with him. Keep talking. Let's move! I'm not this kind of doctor. FRANKLIN: Just keep doing what you're doing. Where's the chopper? Tower? Come on, Brenda. Where's my chopper? CARTER: Franklin, this end! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Keep it coming! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Ready. lt's all right, honey. Hold on. CARTER: Got it. Okay, move him out. -Let's go! Let's go! -Go! One! Two! Three! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I love you! [JANlCE SCREAMS] -Come on! -Get up! Come on! -Carter! -Carter! Come on, Carter! Come on! [WHlRRING AND SQUEALING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Arriba! Pull up, 2-1 8! Pull up! Damn! l can't get a picture. Tower, have you got a visual? Copy. TOM: I can't get anything. -Do you copy? TOM: Going to backup. Got it! [SCREAMlNG] [SCREAMS] I'm gonna take this as a sign. Where is he now? Where is he? -The whole system's shut down. -Brenda? Are you there? TOM: This thing is dead. FRANKLIN: Somebody, please... ...tell me what that is. Please. All right, people, let's move. Now! Get to the door! You can't help him. [CRYING] Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! SUSAN: Carter! JANICE: Let's go! -Come on! TOM: The door frame is bent. [GRUNTS] SUSAN: Come on, Scoggs! -Open it! SUSAN: Come on, go, go, go! FRANKLIN: Go! TOM: Turn it! Turn it! No! Brenda? Tower, can you hear me? Anyone, hello? [METAL CREAKING] We gotta get topside, find help. -What? -We're flooded. FRANKLIN: Oh, shit! There's no other stairway from this level. Elevator? It seals off automatically to keep the shaft from filling. There's no way up. All right, all right, okay, okay. If this is a lesson about the drinking, let's just say l've learned it. No need to get carried away, showing me your vengeful side. I know your wrath, Lord. CARTER: If corridor B is dry... ...we go back to the maintenance ladder, climb down to level three. We get to the wet entry. We take the sub topside, two at a time. We go down to get up. All right, let's move. Come on. [CRASH THEN RUMBLlNG] [PREACH SCREAMlNG] Shit! [THUD] Sounds like somebody made it. TOM: Over here! We're over here! [THUDDlNG] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Preach? What the hell is that? Lab equipment maybe, banging around. -Think so? -Not a chance. We gotta get past that door. Let's do it! Come on! CARTER: Give me a hand! Open the door! Go! Go! PREACH: Bird! Come on, bird! Where are you, bird? PARROT: Hey, dickhead! PREACH: Bird? Fat butt! Bird? Anybody here? Cowboy, let me ask you a question. -We should keep moving. -l'm talking to him! Was that a goddamn shark broke through that door? -l expect so. -You expect so? Huh. Well, well, well. Am l the only asshole down here who thinks that a tad bit odd? It can do that? Bust through a steel door? I ain't the expert. Given Gen Two's size and some room to move... ...she could put a couple tons, maybe more, into a hit. So, yeah, in my opinion. If she wants through, she's coming. And these sharks... ...they aren't breaking down doors for the sheer joy of it, are they? They're after us. It's obvious we don't know what they're doing. What the hell did you do to those sharks? Their brains weren't large enough for sufficient amounts of the protein. So we violated the Harvard Compact. Jim and I used gene therapies to increase their brain mass. Larger brain means more protein. As a side effect, the sharks got smarter. You stupid bitch! [CRYING] I didn't want this to happen... ...but with this research, we could wipe out degenerative brain disease. Think of the generations that would be saved. How much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears? You wouldn't understand. I wouldn't, huh? Dumb old Carter wouldn't understand that you used us? That you used me? Someone on the water who wouldn't make waves. Someone who wouldn't ask too many questions. Because he had something to lose. You don't see what we've done here. You've taken God's oldest killing machine and given it a will. You've knocked us to the bottom of the goddamn food chain. It's not a great leap forward, in my book. People we'll save.... Jim? Brenda? Us? FRANKLIN: All right, people. These sharks are thinking hard and clear. So here's the riddle. What does an 8000-pound mako shark... ...with a brain the size of a V-8 engine and no natural predators, think about? I'm not waiting around here to find out. Now you see how that works? She screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us. [PANTlNG] Please let me get out of here. [YELLS] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] What if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean? It's okay. The fence on the ocean side is titanium. And it gives, so it works just like a net. CARTER: Let's get to the sub. We'll discuss it on the way to the top. [SQUAWKlNG] PARROT: Eat me, asshole. Careful, now. Come on, bird. Come on. [CLUCKlNG] -Please, baby. -Dickhead. See Daddy smiling? Come on. Bring your feathery ass here. Come on. [SCREAMS] [SCREAMlNG] [GASPlNG] -Explosion caused that? -No. Nothing in here could've blown with enough force to move that damn sub. Whatever. lt's junk. We could all just dive in and see who makes it to the top. Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie? Just dive in. You could go first, just to lead by example. He was my best friend, Janice. I'm not going in the water. -No way, man! The sharks are in there. -Listen! We put these on. They help fight hypothermia. That's a start. And unless someone's got a better idea... ...we're going to have to swim out of here. [GAS HlSSING] This isn't happening. [COUGHlNG] I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion! So l appreciate the irony, Lord! "Cook dies in his own oven!" But l've got other plans! [GASPS] You ate my bird. Was that the surface? The vibrations are too deep. That was from inside. CARTER: I wouldn't get that close. Just a suggestion. Water's murky. We might make it. No way! No, we won't! It's 230 feet... ...from the lagoon floor to the lagoon surface! The average human swims two feet per second. The average shark swims 50 feet per second. There's no way I'm getting into that pool! What we have here is your basic maintenance ladder. This leads up to the surface. I love you, Scoggs. I really do! Why do l feel a "but" coming on? But we don't know what shape the surface is in. This shaft is air-locked. But if the explosion breached the shaft at surface level... ...we won't have enough pressure to stabilize the pool. If the pool isn't stabilized, there's tons of ocean dying to get in. You'll bring the whole facility down. We're better off with the sharks. You wanna swim with your fishes? Go ahead! I'm opening this door and climbing out of here! -The hell you are! -l don't work for you anymore! -l don't take orders! -Enough! That's enough now, from all of you! You think water's fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once. It got a taste for murder. When the avalanche came... ...it took us a week to climb out. And somewhere, we lost hope. I don't know when we turned on each other. I just know... ...that seven of us survived the slide... ...and only five made it out. Now, we took an oath that I'm breaking now. Swore that we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two. But it wasn't. Nature can be lethal. But it doesn't hold a candle to man. You've seen how bad things can get and how quick they can get that way. Well, they can get a whole lot worse. So we're not going to fight anymore! We're going to pull together and find a way to get out of here! First, we're gonna seal off this pool! [JANlCE SCREAMING] [FRANKLlN SCREAMS] Oh, my God. It just ate him. It just ate him. Christ! I'm not moving. I'm not moving. Someone will come. They'll come and they'll get us, and we'll be fine. -Scoggs. -No. I'm not moving. Listen, Tom, what is the precise structural failure limit for Aquatica? 3200 tons. What happens when we get more than 3200 tons of water in this rig? The support struts go first. Their tolerance is about seven tons. They'll crack like toothpicks. The walls will buckle. They can't handle more than 1 0 tons of pressure. You wanna be here for that? Hell, no. Hell, no. The moment of truth. Again. Go! Go! Go! Tom! I got you. JANICE: Aah! TOM: lt's burning! The elevator's blocking the top. If we make it to level one, we can take the stairs out. [THUDDlNG] Let's get out of here! Go! Go! Go! What are you doing? If they break through, water will bring them right to us. Level two's only partially flooded. If l can get that door open... ...the water will run off there, buy us some time. You're big, real big. -What's that? -The size of your brass balls. Be careful. CARTER: Go! Go! Go, go! Carter! [SCREAMlNG] Jan! Jan, stay there! JAN: Carter! Carter! Get me out of here, Carter! I don't wanna die! Grab my hand! Come on! Come on! I can't! l can't reach! -Aah! Can't reach! -Take it! [SCREAMlNG] [SOBBlNG] -Scoggs. TOM: Yeah? Can you reach that door above you? It's too high. [THUDDlNG] Sharks probably flooded that level too. [METAL THUDDlNG THEN CREAKlNG] Good thing you came to this side. The other side's under water. -We didn't exactly plan it. -Yeah, it wasn't planned. Are you all that made it? TOM: We did it. We're on level one. We can take the stairs to the surface. The stairs are flooded. Trust me, l know. Are you sure? Give us a goddamn break, can't you? [RUMBLING] He always answers. Sometimes, the answer you get isn't the answer you want. We're 60 feet from the surface. There's an emergency hatch on this level, right? This level has bilge pumps on it for storm runoff. If we re-route the emergency generators, we could drain a stairway. -You sure? -Who you gonna trust? -You. -That's right. You trust me. You know, we had poker here tomorrow night. She'd draw to the inside straight when she could've stuck with a pair. Big dreams. Even in death: Standards. Okay, Jan was a healthy girl. Something in here has to run on batteries. -Nice. TOM: Where would a girl keep her... -...mm, thing? -What's the matter with you? My skin's starting to hemorrhage. The sharks smell the blood.... This'll coat it with oil. Look, Carter, what you said down there.... Maybe you were right. Everything I've done... ...l don't think I could've done it without you. I know, Susan. That's the problem. PREACH: Four a.m. I know. One night feels like a whole week. -Relativity. -What? Einstein's theory of relativity. Grab hold of a hot pan, a second can seem like an hour. Put your hands on a hot woman... ...an hour can seem like a second. It's all relative. I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's the best physics explanation l've heard. [CHUCKLES] It works. You stay with the doc. Me and Scoggs are gonna try to get to the wet lab... ...drain that stairwell. -Preach? -What? Would you zip me up, please? TOM: We got one, there's two sharks left... ...and you and the doc are doing a little bathroom love. They got a pill for what's wrong with you? I need to get some things from my quarters. Research data. The tests, they worked. So much death around us, to risk any more life for some numbers.... Without that data, everyone dying isn't just tragic, it's useless. Death is always useless, doctor. This is it. I'll be back before you know it. Carter! [SCREAMlNG] What's going on?! What the fuck's going on? What is that? -lt's okay! -Okay! -What is that? -We're all right! -What the fuck?! -lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay. I thought you were coming back for me. One of your monitors is blocking the panel. -You wanna help me move it? -Yeah. I say we do everything right together. Right together. Hello. My name is Sherman Dudley... ...and if this message finds you, I did not survive, so this is my legacy. I have loved the pulpit, and l have loved the bottle. I did my best to be a good husband, a father. I came up wanting. So what do l have to say to you? What mark do I have to leave behind? We'll begin with the perfect omelet, made with two eggs, not three. Amateurs often add milk for density. This is a mistake. Carter! Come on! [GLASS BREAKS] PREACH: I got you. Come on. Damn it, Scoggs. Where's Susan? PREACH: I'm done. Brothers never make it out of situations like this. Not ever! [SCREAMS] [GASPlNG] [SCREAMlNG] CARTER: Susan! Susan! Susan! Did you do it? Where's Scoggins? I hate to interrupt this moment of burgeoning intimacy... ...but can we get the fuck out of here? -ls this the only way? -Exits are flooded. Whole place is sinking. It's this way or no way at all. You can bring on the good news anytime now. Sharks are attracted to churning water, bright colors. The extinguishers will be a distraction. What about us? The vest'll bring you up too fast. Your lungs'll pop like a balloon. You weren't the sunny kid in your class. I never went to class. How far to the surface? Sixty feet? There's nothing to it. Exhale on the way up, and get the hell out of the water. I gotta equalize the pressure before we blow the air lock. I gotta let the room fill up with water. It'll only take a few seconds. You ready? -No. -Not in the least. Though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...l shall fear no evil... ...for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life... ...because I carry a big stick... ...and I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley. Two sharks down, Lord. One demon fish to go. Can l get an amen? SUSAN: Amen. CARTER: Amen. PREACH: I can't hear you! SUSAN & CARTER: Amen! PREACH: Give me an amen! Stay with us, Lord! Okay, hold on three! Ready? One! Two! Three! [GRUNTS] [SCREAMlNG] Swim! Oh, my God! It's the devil, you know. He'll be okay if we can get out of here. Son of a bitch. What? Those fences are titanium underneath... ...but on top, they're just plain steel. They've been herding us, pushing us where they want. Using us to flood the facility. Oh, my God. That's the answer to the riddle. Because that's what an 8000-pound mako thinks about. About freedom. About the deep blue sea. We have to kill her. That's the first real smart thing you've said all day. [METAL CRASHES] Here we go. Let's go. We ought to get 2 1/2 sticks of dynamite out of these flares. From up here, you ought to be able to see me spear it. When I do, you take this end of this cable... ...hook it up to the boat battery. And boom! Damn! l can't get her! She's too far away! I know how to get her. How? -Bait. -What? She may be the smartest animal in the world... ...but she's still just an animal. Come to Mama. No! Susan! No! Susan, don't! Get out of the water! All right, Lord.... CARTER: Shoot it, Preach! -This is for Scoggins. -Shoot it! [SCREAMlNG] Damn! CARTER: Blow it, Preach! Blow it! The battery! Blow it! Do it! Yeah! Carter! Hey! Bring me some sushi! Forty-five-foot shark... ...and you hit me. Nice. Could've been worse. I could've let him eat your ass. Carter, we're sinking, right? Yeah. Let me ask you something. Are you sure it was just three sharks? Yeah. Oh, okay. That's more like it. [SHlP HORN BLOWlNG] Here comes the next shift. CARTER: I tell you, man... ...l quit this job. Take me back to the ghetto. Amen.
