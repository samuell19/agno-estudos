(Horns) (Music) HEART OVER HEAD (Music) (Music) (Music) (Dog barks) (Music) (Polish) (Polish) (Music) Petra Schneider lives no longer here. -Do you have her new address? Why? -I'm her brother. Jakob Schneider. She moved to Frankfurt to a social services flat. (Music) When we come home, you make your homework. Petra? Petra? Jakob? -Yes. What a surprise. Can I take some things of you? -No, it's fine. Patrick, say "hello" to Jakob. -Hello. Do you still know me? I'm your uncle. Uncle Jakob. I know. -And do you already know what its goanna be? A girl. -Nice. It becomes a little small in here. My friend comes the day after tomorrow. I can also sleep somewhere else. -And where? Why are you looking like that? I will find something. Yeah you really look like your wont, Jakob. What's wrong? I'm travelling around and wanted to see how you are doing. You simply come to Berlin, after first keeping for a whole year silent, then you want to see how I'm doing? -Yes. Exactly. And where are you travelling to? -What's the matter? You want to make me angry? I'm only asking. Or isn't that allowed. -Whatever, but not with such reproachful undertone. Mummy? -What's then? When do I get a rabbit? -I told you already, you can't. You get a baby and I get a rabbit. -I believe, that's something different. But now go first asleep, yes? -Yes. Good night. Get up, sleepyhead. I'm hungry like a horse. You too? I had already breakfast. -Patrick, ready? Yes. -I first bring him away, then I must go shopping. In the afternoon I have a doctor's appointment. Somebody have to go to pick him up at the boy scouts. I will do that, okay? -Good. In Kronberg's community center. Do you know where this is? -Yes, of course. Oh, and something else. I don't know, how long you plan to stay here. But, at the moment we are a little tight with money. Perhaps, you could try to find yourself a job. Yeah, I planned that already for today. Can I get my money? -For what? I have done everything what you said. -You know what? You get you money at the end of the week, OK? -Then I want an advanced payment. I haven?t eaten the whole day. -Then take a bread roll. You must sign here. I will be right back, okay? Thank you. Wanda, when do we go? -We go soon. Bye. -Bye. Jakob? Shit. What are you doing here? I'm here to pick up my nephew. -You aren't much taller since last. What are you doing? -How much longer till they are ready? We still have to sing our boy scout's song. Come. -No, I wait here outside. You aren't anymore a boy scout? Or have you forgotten the text? Come. So, final circle, people. Loose, final circle. Jakob, what is with you? The lily banner blow, come brother reach the hand. And even if the storm blow, we go through the land. We go up and down. Hey, everything okay? What do we do now with him? -I take him to my home. You have this often? Then I surly would go seeing a doctor. I haven?t eaten in 3 days, therefore. -Honestly? How is it with your father? Didn't he remarry? I didn't have much to do with them, apart from that I lived there. Have you gone to school there then? -Yes. That school was really better as the one here. -And now? You stay here? I do an exchange year in the USA. -Oh yes? Congratulations. If it doesn't work out, you can come back to my class. Wanda, do you get us please another bottle of water from the cellar? Thank you. It's sweet from you. -At the time we saw it all happen, when I still lived there. How your mother became so ill. I believe, you weren?t at the funeral, or where you? Yes, I believe we must go now. I still have some old clothes, they should fit you now. You can't be serious... -Stop reacting like this. Well, just look how he is walking around. -What do you think about? Not so well. No, Wanda. They have to go in the laundry. They are absolutely filthy. Just look everywhere are tomato spots on it. Yes? Washing machine. Actually where do you come from? -Poland. Ah, I understand. What? -Yes, well, it's nice. And do you like it working here? Yes. Yes. When I came to Germany, I saw for the first time a washing machine. Really? -Bauknecht. Everything automatically, and the engine is really quit. Through the window you can easily watch, how it becomes all clean. It made me cry. Later I would like to have also such a washing machine. Well. -Admit that you at first believed me. Nope, nonsense. -However. No. -Wanda? Go to the cupboard, where all your bank statements are... Wanda? Do you please get Charlotte in her bed? -I must go. Do we meet again? -I don't know. Hello, Wanda? -Hello. Yes, it's Jakob here. -I already know. Hi. -what is it? Do we meet tonight? -I don't know, I still go to the club. What for a club? Aupairs club? -Do you know where it is? Yes, no, I know it. This is in the community center, on the way back... Jakob, everything okay? -What? Has something happened? -No, no. Nothing has happened. OK. Then tonight we see each other, yes? (Polish) (Polish) Hi. -Hi. Is Wanda here? -Who? Wanda. -No. One gin & tonic, please. -We have beer and alcohol-free drinks. Then I take a beer. Can I speak to Wanda? No, she left one hour ago. Can I help you with something? No, it's fine. Yes. Thank you. Helmut. Where is Wanda? -Earlier on she told, that they will be swimming at Dirk Bachmann's house. -She isn't coming back? No. Why haven?t you told me that immediately? -You only wanted to know if she was here. How can I know that you are waiting for her? -Of course you knew this, ass. How should I know what's in your mind? -You, I beat you up immediately. Fool! Stop it. Stop it. Jakob, why you make only annoyance? - You aren't completely normal, really! Come inside. Come on. It's quite warm. Jakob? I thought you were in Berlin. -No, not anymore. Since when do you have a pool? -My father has it from a supermarket. It's dreamlike. To swim, however, is it not a little bit too small? Nah. There are much more ways to use it. Tomorrow we have here the international barbeque party. -Hello! Come over here. We sit here talking. Milena is there and a few friends. Yes, I see. -No, thank you. It's time for me. I have to go home. -Well! If one can do nothing. Do you want another Martini? Wait. -Do you want another Martini? Yeah. -Jakob! Do you do it because of the money, or does give it you after a year an aupairs certificate? What certificate? -A document, stating, that one has cleaned the loo's during 1 year with the Gebhard's. You have totally no clue of it? -From what? What an aupair all have to do. I learn German, look after the children, shopping, household, cooking. Yes. (Polish) (Music) Well if you want... then you can call me. I give you my number. You have something to write? Hey! (Polish) What have you just talked about? Some of the girls come from a small village. If there a boy with a girl goes for a walk, they are together. I find this ridiculous, but that's the way they are. If that's a sensation for you, than you haven?t much going on. At 14 we weren't that stupid any more. I have said that you are already 18 and play the piano. -What? They shouldn't say, you are too young. -But I'm 18. Really? Excuse me. How is it now? Do we see each other once more? I think, you go to the USA. -There are still problems with my visa. It means, I'm still here for much longer and have plenty of free time. With a German friend generally it doesn't work out well. Do you had some bad experiences that way? How do you mean? -I don't know. Earlier on in the pool ... -What was in the pool? There I thought for a moment, you and Dirk... And if, then it doesn't matters for you. (Music) Shit. (Music) (Ringing) (Petra) Jakob, can you open the door? Jakob? Jakob! Go, open the door! Finally. You, dickhead, you... The rear is completely damaged. With full speed in reverse? Hm? -It wasn't full speed. Don't be cheeky. Here, this costs you 5.000 - What's going on here? Who are you? Ben Papanikolau. -Yes, and? Are you the mother? -No, the sister. I'm sorry. I want only, that the boy writes me a debt confession. Signs if everything is in it. -I sign here nothing at all. Tomorrow the money. Otherwise police. -You know? If one messes things up, don't be a coward with denying. -you believe him? That's not the point. -Nevertheless. He tries to make me guilty for something I haven?t done. -Oh, the car drove by itself? What do I know? He can have been damaged already from before. And was it before already broken? Yes. You start with the first shift. That is by the way Claudio. That here are the boilers, here is the distribution. - How early is that with the first shift? From 6 to 14 o'clock. Can you get up so early? Fine. I find it okay. Then look around how everything works. And later Achmed will explain you the machine. Achmed? Achmed? Achmed, Jakob. Don't jump of the steps, do you hear? They have here sometimes been until late at night. For ambiance is it completely shit. (Polish) (Polish) Have you already once been friends with an aupair? Yes. It's actually ideal. At the beginning. Yes, and then no more or how? -Once you have tried out everything with each other soon after the differences become to much, and it becomes to stay in the way. Anyhow it has no point building up a steady relation. -Why? Because she has to go sometime back to her country. Or because she makes it all more complicated. Well, I don't mean it any bad, but then I rather look for a new one. -Also again an aupair. Yes. For the evening pleasures the children have to leave, do you know?. Just come up with something. (Polish) Now it's time for you to go home. -No, get out! This is our stable. Don't you want to go playing in your garden? -No. And now please go. It's dumb, if you watch. So this way. Go out now. And bye. -Do you like horses? Yes, of course. You also? There you aren?t allowed to look inside. If you go immediately home, tomorrow we go to a real horse. Really? -Yeah, sure. Excuse me, I have looked only at the pictures. Hey, Wanda! Listenen, tomorrow we go to a real horse! May we also ride there? -Stop it, making promises to the children. For them it's very serious. -For me too. Charlotte, Clara. Come. Dirk? -Yes? Can you please do me a favor? I don't want that Jakob finds this out. Why not? -Have you said him already something? No. -It's over and... I don't want it anymore. -Yes. Wanda? Can I count on you that Milena also finds nothing out? (Music) Don't you want to take off your top? -Only if you take off your shorts. Oh come on, please, yes? -No. He has been with many aupair's. -I thought, you are friends. OK, I take everything back. He is only a dull guy with whom one can go stealing cars. And why cars? -This was a joke. Cars. Poland. Do you understand? -Of course. But it was not funny. Well. I'm not funny. But Dirk, he is a real comedian. Should we go swimming too? -No. It's to cold. No, you?re right. It has become cold. Do you want my jacket? -No, thank you. No, I really give it you with great pleasure. -But, then you are freezing. No. I'm quite warm. From drinking. Really. Is this also selvedge? -No, this is my jacket, and I give it to you because you have cold and I quite warmly. We can stay discussing about until you have frozen to death. Or you take it. A very thick summer jacket. So, I believe, Wanda is the problem. Milena would do already more, if Wanda was more easy going too. She also hardly drinks anything. Go in the water. -I tried already. But, she don't want. Why? -Your pool is to cold. And in Cracow it's warmer, or what? If nothing happens soon, then they are away. I know this. So, the upstairs area is mine and my parents live downstairs. They have here no access. This way. There is the bathroom. Yes, come inside. And sit down. (Music) Looks comfortable, not. You can sleep here if you want. This is no problem. Milena. What is? This would be nice, not? -I don't know. Only if Wanda stay too. -I rather go home. Oh come! There is one more room. One for you and one for Milena. Why are there 2 rooms? -So ones doesn't disturb while sleeping. Well it doesn't disturb me, if Wanda sleeps with me in the bed. Oh okay, that's also a possibility. Then you sleep both together in a room. Why not? (Polish) Aren't you allowed? Have your aupair parents forbidden this? No. But I prefer rather to sleep at home. Me too. -Yes, but what makes it different there? Whether you spend the night here or there? -There is actually, no difference. Therefore I can also sleep at home. Finally! What's wrong? Slowly I runned out all the conversation topics I have. So, quite late. -It's such a dry air in here. I couldn't sleep at all. There is a fountain missing. Yes. There are some nice ones from Hong Kong. Even with lighting. Can I still get you something? -A beer maybe? Let me see I find one. -I think, we haven't any left. Jakob, now I really want to go asleep. -Has he said something about the money? 800. -Really? He can repair it himself. -He must want something of you. Are you crazy? Tomorrow my friend comes. This is for J?rgen. For whom? -For my friend. Tomorrow he comes. Now take care of your visitor. -You talk some more with him. Maybe it becomes even still cheaper. -No. Really not. If I'm in the way somehow, then you must tell me. No. Lets watch TV. Jakob! Here, rinse this first. I need this. Yes. Take. Can you put it there please? Thank you! 2 girls are waiting outside. What? 2 girls are waiting outside. For me? -Yes. Bye. Do we still go to the aupair's club? We can go having a drink or something. I don't know, when we are back. Dirk has a surprise for the children. What kind of surprise? -Jakob! Jakob! -Hey, hello. With the horse, is it true? -Yes, of course. Nice. -Hold on. Where do you want to go? I don't know. You must ask Dirk. -Where do you want to go? To the horse. -A horse? This is a superhorse. Bye, Helmut. Hey, are you feeling sick? OK. You warn me in time? -So you don't puke on me! Charlotte? Look, do you see the electricity pylon? Look good and then at the next one. Ok? Yes. Yes, there in front on the right. Here on the right go in. Then I saw the whole car. Yes. Actually, it's here always open. -So that the "horse" we can also go for a walk sometime. Hey, tell me, when was you here actually for the last time? Quietly. -Tell me, this isn't possible. Okay, but now don't let me hang. What's his name? -You can give him a name. Then I first have to know, is it a stallion or a marry? I don't know. Then you have... then you have to check it out. It only can be male or female. -I do not know. You can't see this fully. -Wanda what is this? Well, I think it's a gelding. -What is a gelding? A gelding is a castrated stallion. -Yes, nevertheless, let?s go for a ride, okay? Cool no. -And where is the saddle? Hey, stop. Milena! What should I do then? I do not know. To me this becomes too dull, I go sitting in the car. Cut him off the way. -Right now stop. Stop. (Polish) Girls, you can spend the night here. It is really no problem. As he at least had said: Here a comfortable room, have a look. Such a nice bed. -How they looked. But I find Dirk, nevertheless, quite good. He is at least amusing. And not any stingy as the others. And how do you like Jakob? -Very well. I don't know why. But from the start I liked him immediately. I always feel butterflies when he is there. -Hey, tell me do you actually want to sleep with Jakob? Yes. I think so. Wanda, look. -Hold him! How then? Simply just stop! Jump off! Clara! Charlotte! Come immediately! These boys are really so silly. Now you have to jump fully in it. Hey. Wait. Or you make the whole back seat filthy. Comes out, out! Should they walk home? -Whatever. With these shoes they don?t come in the car. -I believe, I must puke! My God, plastic bag. -Charlotte! Oh my God! Shit. If my father sees the car, he gets a heart attack. Please take nothing more of the plate. This has my sister prepared tonight for her friend, that comes. -If we are not allowed at least can't we have something to drink? -Here this makes a mess just all on the floor. Do you have something like a cloth? Or a mop? -I go get a mop. You, Wanda? What is that? This I do not know. Hydrated lotion. -It smells good. Try it. Yes. You have there cream in your nose. Oh. Thank you. Yes. It is a pity that the children have not come to the horse riding. The horse was bad just on it. -Charlotte and Clara have nevertheless very much liked. Yes? You are her hero. -Yes, I did it with pleasure. Milena, with the make-up things is my sister a little bit familiar. Jakob? Jakob? I can explain this. We have actually here, only made a briefly stopover. Hello. -Hello. Wanda. Petra. Oh yes, and the children have taken a little to eat. I hope, this is not a problem. Tasted deliciously. My compliment. -Bye. Bye. One see himself. -Exactly. Does he often keep you waiting? -No, not really. OK, Patrick, let?s start. J?rgen! Hello. Where were you so long then? (Petra and J?rgen argue) What is with your brother, humph? -What do you have with my brother? It is here about you and me. Remember also for once, the fact that we have not seen each other for three weeks? Hello. Can you give that to your sister, from me? No, actually, I don?t want to go in that again. Ah. I still become money of you. 800 Euro?s. Oh, I see. Now I have a really good job. And Monday get I then the first money. It is OK, or? This is OK -Good. (Music) Wanda? What is wrong? -Let me in. The dog makes noises. Why you do not come tomorrow? -I have a sleeping problem. What? -I do not know where I should sleep. Do you have troubles with your sister? -Yes, now her friend is there and they argue just without stopping. -This is really bad. And when does she get her baby? Perhaps in 2, 3 days. I would help her with pleasure, but I do not know at all, how. Yes, and the others in your family? -There is no one else. Only you and Petra? -Yes, and little Patrick. Is it OK, that I sleep here, yes? -Mmh. Does this go? This is my mother, my father and my brother Jarek. And this here? -Goisa, friend of Jarek. They fit fell together. -why? They do a lot together, have plans. A common future. Can I ask you something? -Yes. Why you have run away from here? -I haven?t run away at all. I have gone to my father. -Yes, but you don't have finished you school . What has happened? OK. You must not say it. -However. I would like to tell you it with pleasure. You have already heard a part of it haven't you, or? Your mother has died. Do you have something to drink? -Yes, in the cellar. There isn't any juice. -Is there any wine? Yes I think so. Yes, well. Only one teeny-weeny bottle. Red or white? Red. I'm sorry. (Polish) Wanda? -Yes? Can I walk in? -Hold on. Immediately. Put your wine away. I better can go. -Stay here. Ute Gebhard do not need it now. -Jakob, please! Do I interfere? -What a question. Jakob, this way it does not go. -Yes, I think so too. We should talk. -Yes but now isn't a good time. This is my house and you just do not take things without asking. Nonsense. We just want to be a little alone. Wanda, come out with me. -Yes. I am really good-natured, but this is too much. -Other guest's parents would have Jakob thrown out for a long time. We try to find a peaceful solution for it, but this way is unacceptable. -I already go. This irritates here only. -Your behavior irritates, Jakob. Twaddle ... Go now. Still a nice evening, Mrs. Gebhard. -Incredibly. I can't believe this. (Music) Pst! Is the type still there? -J?rgen? No. He is already gone. Come, I show you something. Come. Sit down. Is good, or? -Stay just before the door. This is good for the air. -For the air? You sleep better from it. -Yes. (Music) There are still a few basic things. Namely I would find it great, if we spoke from now on only German. After all that?s why you are here. I can understand you better. However. This has already its advantages. And who does not keep to it. There I have brought something. This is not my luck bringer, this is yours. He is also fully guaranteed. Who does not do so now, is allowed to pay 50 cent. It's always well received, I know. Great idea of me. I find that really good. Because you are able to do it when you try out your new make-up, in the disco for example spending on drinks. OK, everything clear. Oh whom do we have here? -I wait outside. No problem, no problem. Come and stay here, come on. And to whom do you belong? -Wanda. Yes. Well, OK. Come, sit down here. Then you can inspect it immediately. Come closer quite a bit. Wanda? And, how do you like it? You are the nicest girl whom I know, without make-up. (Polish) Wanda, still 50 cents. -Wait a minute! I will briefly say something. Now listen to me. Yesterday I was very angry. Because you never listen. Because you argue with my guest's mother. You have a big mouth. And when you need to be responsible, you run away. The Gebhard have kicked me out. -And the wine bottle? What about the wine? -This was very embarrassing for me. You also wanted too! And you helped yourself in the fridge too. Or do you always ask? -Wine is more expensive. How much more expensive? 2 Euro's, 3 Euro's? -Hey, the Gebhard's are nice to you. They invite you to come eating. He gives you a job. And you, you only act like a fool. I will pick you up later, ok? -I do not have time. In the evening? -Also not. Come, come. Soup taste. -Yes, Yes. Oh. Do you do it away? Thank you. Hey, Helmut, your eyes have become worse, right? Why? -Just look in your pot. Are you only a nasty bastard? Are you crazy? All right, guys? Is there something wrong with the soup? You are only a few days here and suddenly there come the problems. We live since 6 months with Wanda together. And so far it worked out fine. If my wife ever gets angry again with you, you are never allowed to come back. This is my first and last warning. Now take your money and disappears. Am I dismissed? -Your shift is over, you whistle! Or do you want to do one more? -Nope. Thank you. Look, up there. 3rd row of the top. The one with the pearl? -Yes. That one I find incredibly beautiful. He is nice. You know what, I purchase it now. Or do you find it over the top? -With such a gift it depends on it, how important somebody is. Absolutely importantly. Actually, the most important in my life. -You do not have to do this. Rise your money rather. -No, it is done. I find this good. Oh Petra, and you are sure, that Wanda likes that one? Yes. I'm sure. -Super. Hello. I would like to buy that ring there with the pearl. Do I pay cash. For us it's just not that one could say: Ok, yesterday we kissed and today one can go a little further based on that, and see what else swill pass. Unfortunately, that just doesn't go. If a girl is reserved, then it is for 2 reasons: Either, she finds the persons irritatingly or really good. -How should I get to find this out? That you really can?t find out. Super Tipp. Stop! J?rgen! J?rgen! -Hey. What are you doing there? -This is mine. I brought along. You have given him to me. -Borrowed! Let us go inside to talk again. -You see, I do have no time. I am prevented, I must go now. -Who is the woman in the car? Nobody. You cannot go like that! Is this your new girlfriend or what? Petra. -You stupid ass! Petra, we can still talk about everything. -Give me my flat keys! This is stupid, what we do here. -Give me the damn keys! OK, here you have your shit keys! I cannot see you anymore! Shit. Mummy? Do you leave? No, I pack only my things for the hospital. So that I have everything ready. Am I able to come? -It is still not so far. And if, do you go to Mrs. Leitner? -And when? In one week. Petra? I accompany you of course, when it is so far. Yes? -Of course. I wouldn't let you go alone into the hospital. thank you. -Thank you. Lisa what are you doing tonight? -We go to Frankfurt, to the disco. Milena too? -Yes. Bye. Shit. -Why? My father has locked up the car in the garage. Without a car we can't go anywhere. -Come, let's go over there now. Nope. It isn't time to fool. How should it go then? They should come to us. Hey, Helmut. -Hello. We go with Helmut. No, I rather prefer the city railroad. -The city railroad? It still comes so far. Hello. Hello, Milena. -What is it going to be? We all drive together. It is amusing. -Am I the taxi control centre or what? Get out, everyone. -Wanda! Please come with us. Milena, not you, the boys! Milena! Oh what now? -Well what is it? Ride behind. -You I take with me. Ok than not. Then I take him with. As a front seat passenger. -Since when is there this rule? Please, Helmut. Do not work on my nerves now. -Just drive off. Humph? I find, jazz so cool. And tomorrow I go to "Jazz in the museum". Will be great. My brother has there a flat. And then I sleep there, he is just on vacation. Than we can hold there a party. -Who? Only you and me, we two. -I don't want. Oh nonsense, with the girl, I mean. -No, no party. Oh come. -I want no party! No party! Hey, Helmut. How is it actually going for your brother? Are there many socks sold? -Yes, actually, it is a rather high demand for. -All right. And only socks or also knee socks? -For you also romper in pink. A great joke! (Disco music) (Music) And now? -Don't know. Do Make a suggestion. Where is Milena? Milena? Where? I don't know! -Ok. We can go on the parking bay. There we are alone, and is it dark. How about it? Humph? -And what do you want there? Or we go to the flat of Helmuts brother. There starts a gigantic party. (Music) Do you dance? -Not at the moment. I thought, it was dancing. -What? Yes, what you just do. Very, very quiet dancing. Yes. Actually, rather much, very quiet sitting. Ok. Can we go out? Or is that to much stress? No. -No? It is good. -Ok. Hey! Milena! Hey. Good. -Oh, Helmut. Hello! How are things? Was looking for you. -Here I am. I have heard, You throw a party? -No, what for a party? Who says so? Oh, that's a pity. But you can calm me. So in the flat of my brother. He is not there now. We can... -No, I do not do that alone. We can take Wanda and Jakob. And Dirk. Yes. I look forward too. -Me too. And tomorrow we go to "Jazz in the museum". For me? -Mmh. Thank you. You can open them too. -Yes? I Hope you like it. If not, then say it rather immediately. I have thought, immediately at you when I saw it. Wait! One more thing. Wanda... I... If you... Oh no, now simply open it. (Romantic music) Were you already in Spain? -No. Is there really nicely. Maybe I buy him for 1.8 or in such a way. Now he has already 150,000 on it, but he is just very practical. You can sleep in it for two, for example. During the holidays. Really cheap fuel consumption he did not, but the good thing about the car is easy, it can be found even in the dark. Incidentally, this is really nice what you're wearing. So, time for party music. -This is not a party. This is just sitting together. If it is too quiet to you, you can go. -Is there beer? It's nothing. I will take a Tea. With 2 pieces of sugar please. With pleasure. Let us see, whether a room is available somewhere. I still have to take my tea. -Forget the tea. Milena? Would you like something to drink? -Yes, please. Thank you. It's hot. Yes. I have here Scrabble. Do you know that? -Yes, I know. We play this with my host family -But I find this a really good game, if that is with real Scrabble rules. Not with fictitious words or in such a way. However, these are a lot of letters. Hey, Helmut, it would be incredibly nice if you could leave us now alone. So? -Yes. Actually, I don't like pearls. -Shit. I knew that. Give it to her. -No, I will keep it. But, nevertheless, you do not like him at all. -Right. But I will keep it. We must talk. -Not now. Please. But, now. Immediately. Sorry. Be right back. -Ok. What has happened? -You know that very well. Nope. I thought it was a party. -Party. I keep hearing party. Who tells then such shit? -Dirk. I do not make the fat available as a love nest. And I cannot be thrown out my brothers flat! Who has thrown you out? -Dirk, who else? I wanted with Wan... with Milena go to "Jazz in the museum". It was so settled. And now sit there on the ... I think it's not funny! Now they sit there on the couch. The guy gets his neck to the full. First with Wanda and now with Milena. What do you mean with first Wanada? -Ask Dirk. Everything OK? -Yes. I come right away. Good. What should I ask him? Now listen here, to make it as ridiculous insinuations. Dirk has been mating Wanda. If you do not know this, than I am really sorry for you. You are lying. -No. I'm not. How do you know that? Have you been there or what? No, but I know it. Clara Gebhard is with me in the boy scouts group. She reads with passion Wanda diary and there everything is in it. In great detail. This is such a shit story. This is so stupid and made-up so crappy. Have you had something with Wanda? -As usual? Is she also in your collection? Oh, I see. No. -Anyhow, you had to think long about. Have you lost track? I'm talking with you. Just get up. Since we can still talk about it tomorrow. -How to talk about it? I think, there was nothing. Or, is it? -Yes. What does that mean? -Yes means yes. Please, Jakob. You get this in the wrong way. To me this makes absolutely no difference. Wanda? What is it? -Do you hear? What is going on here at all? Are you nuts? -Stand still. I have no desire to chasing behind you. -Then leave it. Yes, you are right. I waste my time. I'm cold. Are you listening? I said, I'm cold. Give me the jacket. All right. What do you want? Nothing. Just leave me alone, OK? Jakob! If you now send me away, Then it is over. That is all just drivel. Yesterday Dirk, now I do. You do this only to make him jealous. -Are you nuts? That is 3 months ago. Dirk makes totally no difference to me. -Why do you always hang around with him? I can go wherever I want. -Yes, of course, do that. However, stop taking the piss out of me. -You always breaks everything, you idiot. Yes, I will ruin everything? Who has lied? Who has so... Tell me one reason why do you not told me the truth! Because you misunderstand everything. Even in German you want to misunderstand it. You are much too young. -Good thing that this still has occurred to you. Now it is due all at once again.
