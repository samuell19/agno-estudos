Hello. No, now it's not the best time. Can I call you back later? Yes. It's in the middle of nowhere, yeah. Mom. It's always the same question. I already told you where it was. It's Upstate New York, near Springwell. No. No, no, it's not in ruins, no. It just needs a little fixing up. Give her a big kiss. Listen, we still have a lot of unpacking to do. I'll call you back later, I promise, okay? Bye, Mom. So when's the queen mom paying us a visit? Oh, don't hold your breath. Hey, june bug. Hey. Come here. Come here. It's gonna be fine. I promise. Look. Home. Yeah. Sweet home. Kate! - Okay, I'm coming. - Okay. Okay. Kate? Oh shit. Are you crazy? Come here you. You gave me a heart attack. What are you doing? I said I'll handle this. Like next month or something? What that supposed to mean? Means you can start drawing and then nothing else will mater. - Hey. - What? - I wasn't nagging you. - Come on. Are you serious? Why did I have to fall in love with an artist? Well, you can't say your mom didn't warn you. Hey. Hey! It's faster than the stairs. Sorry. Kate! What's going on? Shit. I'm calling the power company. We did it. You'll become a great painter. And I'll be a perfect housewife. Slowly turning into fat Carol. - I will love you fat. - Yeah, sure. You know you should grow a longer beard. Genius painters all have beards. What? - My God, you're such a wimp. - What? I'm not a wimp. I know all about life in the wilderness. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Like Belgium has anything remotely wild about it. Hey, we make close to a thousand different beers. I say that's pretty wild. Oh my God. What have you dragged me into. Now I'm stuck here with the city boy. Come here, you farm girl. - I'll show you farm girl. - You'll show me farm girl? Show me farm girl. All you need to do is take that first step. Yeah, I know. Do it. Honey. - Do we have plans of the house? - Yeah, I think so. - Hello, Andre. - Hey, Katerina. I'm going to cut to the chase. You're my best translator, and I need this for yesterday. - Flatter will get you everywhere. - I know I'm asking a lot. Yeah, and paying very little. 2 weeks? I can't do that in 2 weeks. I need more time, not money. I'm not sure. Matt? The guy from the power company is here. Jesus. Here it is. - Holy Mary Mother of God. - I know. What? This thing is older than my grandma. - Is it causing the surges? - Could be. Can you do anything about it? I have never seen anything like it. I guess that you're not from these parts? No, we just moved down from New York. - And before that? - Europe. You know I was really surprised when they told me somebody finally bought this place. And again, it was a long time ago. What was a long time ago? The previous owners. They got killed in this house. You know? Shit, nobody told you? Listen, if I was you, I wouldn't touch it. But I'll get you an estimate when I can. Well, good luck. House of Blood. Brutal slaying of 2 in Carroll County. Two people were found dead in their home yesterday morning near Durham, police said in a statement. The couple, identified as Paul and Medeline Shaeffer were found by Mr. Robert Korby. The identity of the suspect remains unknown. God, I need another bottle. Matt? Where did you get all this stuff? Honey! The real Van Gogh, 1889. Yeah, sure. "Apples", by Paul Cézanne. Matt? Are you high or something? Maybe. Honey. What do you need most in the world? There's nothing I need. A better job? No, name a thing. Come on, there's gotta be something, anything. Please, do it for me. I want a thousand dollars. Why didn't I think of that. Okay, okay, okay. Are these fake? Does it look fake? Where did you find this? Here. How did it get here? Like everything else, it just... got here. Fine, let's see how far I can take this. What if I asked for more? - Do it. - Ten thousand? - Make it a hundred thousand. - Sure, why not a million? Ask for it. Alright. I want a million dollars. Hey, hey, hey. This is fucking scary, Matt. Yes it is, but I think we should enjoy it. - I've got a bad feeling. - June bug, come on. Let's just... Have fun. Hey, come on. Let's have some fun. I want the best champagne in the world. Tons of champagne. It's so funny. I want money, and more money! I want money! I wanna be a princess. I just awarded my brilliant career as a translator. That's my girl. Is this caviar? Beluga, my dear. The best of caviars. You are so greedy. How does it work? What do you want me to say? It's like, I don't know. Computer? Who cares how it works. You just... use it. Yeah, but computers can get bugs. ♪ God is everywhere. ♪ ♪ Christ. ♪ ♪ Driving me insane. ♪ ♪ Well, don't you think twice, it's my only advice. ♪ Kate? - Hey. - Hey. Where is the necklace you asked for? I don't know. Anyway, it was just a figment. I can always get another. And another. And... another. And... another! - Don't open them. - What? - No peeking. - This is so mysterious. Come on, come on. Open them. Let's give it another try. Honey, remember what the doctor said. There's nothing wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with me. There's no reason we can't have children. The doctors... have no idea what they are talking about. We already tried twice. Both babies died. In here, remember? It happens to millions of couples. It happened to us. To me. I can't do this again. Kate. Kate. I'm going for a ride. Kate? Hello. Kate? Who's baby is this? Look, it's a boy. What the fuck is wrong with you? - What? You wanted it. - No like this. - There was no other way. - Yes, there was. - Not for us. - We could've tried again. - What, and failed again? - You don't know that. I took a shortcut. A shortcut? Are you out of your... Are you out of your fucking mind? You used the room to make a baby. Yes, yes I did. Well, now do what you need to do. What's that supposed to mean? You know what it means. We're not keeping it. You can't be serious. Kate, you are not... Kate. Kate, this is wrong. Come on. Say the words. I don't know. What do I say? Say anything. Say... You want it... You want it gone. It's alright, I'll do it. I'll do it. Come on, do something! What do you want me to do? It's the middle of the night. So go to the room! I want a baby's bottle with milk. Yeah, thank you. He wouldn't wait. How did you... I don't know, it just works. Aren't you a lousy boy. Yeah. What? What was that? - Yes? - Hi. - What patient do you wish to see? - John Doe. You want to see John Doe? The John Doe? - How many do you have? - Just the one. So, what's the problem? When you want to see someone at a psychiatric ward you have to be on that person's approved visiting list. John Doe has no list. You mean he hasn't received a single visit? - In 45 years? - Reporters. Are you a reporter? Sure. You're no reporter. My name is Matt DeWitt. I live in a Springwell house. I've been waiting a long time for this. For you. How do you like it? Do you know about it? You having fun? Come on. Nice clothes. Great food. Maybe some jewelry, some cash? Pussy, maybe? - What do you want from me? - Why did you kill the Shaeffers? It was the only way. I need answers. What you need is advice. Forget about the room. Get out of the house, and do that now, before it's too late. No, but you won't, will ya? I can see it. I know your kind. - My kind? - Yeah, creatures of need. You crave and you crave and you crave and then... you die. - And you're different? - Oh, yeah. In more ways than you can imagine. Hey, come here, let me tell you something. The only thing more dangerous than a person who can't get what they want is the person who gets whatever they want. Forty bucks, please. Yes, you are a little bug. It's okay, it's okay. Yeah, let's go see. Let's go see what's going on. Stop it, stop it! Is this gonna hurt the baby? I'm trying to figure out how it works. Now we suddenly need to know? I do. Where are you going? - For breath of air. - No. It's not safe. - What are you talking about? - Kate. Trust me. I have my reasons. What reasons? Matt. What reasons? Look at you. Matt! Matt! You know what's going on, don't you? Not for sure. Well, you know something. There is this man. He knows about the room. Who? - A Mr. John Doe. - Come on, that's not funny! - Oh, forget it. - Matt, please. Kate, the point is... The room makes things, okay? That's what it does, it's like... A giant 3D printer. It makes stuff, in a one condition. Which is that you never take that stuff outdoors. - And if you do... - What, it ages? And it turns to dust. But... The baby is not a thing. Yes it is. It's a thing made of flesh and bones. A soul. Hi. It's alright. It's alright. Come on, concentrate. Tom and Katie... Tom and Katie go camping. Good. What's camping? It's when you live a tent, when you are on vacation. - Can I go for camping? - No, you can't. For the same reason you can't answer the door. You're sick, my love. I don't feel sick, not germ sick. Well, that because you are in this house. It protects you. But if you go outside, the germs will get you. There are no germs in this house? Only good germs. - I wanna go camping. - Will see. Now. Oh my, says Katie. I forgot my bathing... Cat. - There's no such thing as a bathing cat. - Yes, there is. Take a cat, throw it in a tab, that's a bathing cat. Okay, Shane, I'm not in the mood. It's a "P", so it's bathing... Cat. It's cap, bathing cap. - Say it. - Bathing cat. - Enough. - Cat, cat, cat. - Stop that. - Cat, cat, cat. Stop it, right now! Cat! Cat! You go pick those up. Right now, Shane! Shane. Breakfast's ready. Eat. Come on, eat your eggs. Shane, you come back here and finish your breakfast. Now. - Good morning, Ma'am. - Good morning. - Thank you. - Here you go, have a nice day. Matt, delivery. Shane! What's got into you? - What's got into you! - What happened? Okay, it's okay. Come. It's okay. Kate. Hey! I'm not doing this. You don't like it? Feel free to leave anytime you want! Stop it, please. You'll hurt your teeth. I love you. Do you love me? Of course I do. Can I sleep with you? I want to be with you forever. Do you want to be with me forever too? Of course I do. Of course. Come here, come here. What are you doing in here? What happened? How long are you gonna be doing this? These ridiculous hermit routine. I told you he can not come in here. This is my room. Why do you have to do this? He's just a baby. No, he's not, he's a figment. For fuck sake, I'm not having this conversation again. Kate - Kate. - What? - Did you do this? - What time is it? - Did you? - No. Shane. Did you do this? This is amazing. Matt! What's the matter with you? Stop! You do not go in there, do you understand? Leave him alone. I'm sorry, mommy. You do it all the time, It's not really outside. There are no germs in there. It's okay. You can't stop us from going into the room. Watch me. Matt, he was only playing. He didn't hurt anyone. What does it mean, Matt? That Shane is clever? He's smarter than we are? It means, he can dream up, I don't know... A Dragon. And a dragon will magically surface in our home. A host of dragons. - Are you afraid of him? - Of course I am. - And you should be too. - But he's only a child. So he can't control his emotions. He can get mad at you because you wouldn't let him watch TV. He can want to hurt you, or me. Or both of us. I'm not giving him that option. And you should... Hello? - Hello boy. - Yes? Who is this? You know you not allowed to answer the phone? How did you get this number? - Who was it? - He said his name was... John... Doe. You don't call here, you understand? So you made a child, Matt. Nice boy. Did you ask for it? - Who asked for it, Matt? - My wife. What's your connection with the room? My mother showed it to me, next question. Is there a way to stop the aging process? You mean the way to bring something outside of the house so it doesn't turn to dust? Yes. Yeah, there's a way, Matt, but I don't think you wanna know. I have to know. You know the rule, Matt - nothing created inside the room can survive outside the house. You know that, right? Wrong. Answer this. What did it take for man to be free? - I'm not in the mood for riddles. - What did it take? I... I don't know. God had to die, of course. Didn't you read Nietzsche? Man wants to be free, but first the creator must die. That's just... The natural order of things, you know. Children outliving their parents. I don't understand. No, I think you do understand, Matt. Think. Matt, if your wife dies, then the child she created inside the room becomes part of this world. He's free to live and love and... age like anyone else. He's free to be... sent to a mental institution for the rest of his life. You're a figment too. That's why you killed them. The truth is, they wanted me to live. So they knew they had to die. At first, mother kills father and then she forced me to... That was... That was hard enough. But here's the question for you, Matt. What are you gonna do? You want to kill the child to save your wife? Or you want to kill your wife to save the child? Kate? Kate, I'm officialy worried. Call me, okay? Or better you'd come home. Hello, this is Kate. Please leave a message. Fuck! Where is mommy? I don't know. When she coming back? I don't know. - You don't know anything? - That's right. What's a figment? You told mommy I was a figment, is that bad? No, it's... It's nothing. Forget I said that. Come on, eat your food. You are not my dad. At least we agree on something. Where is he? Where is my real dad? What did you do to him? Where is my real one? Tell me where he is. Tell me where my real dad is! Listen, kid. You don't have a dad. You don't have a mother either. Kate is not your mother. - Yes she is. - No, she is not. And you are not a real kid. You wanna know what the figment is? It's something that's not real. Like you. Do you know why you are not allowed to go outside? Forget germs. If you leave this place, you'll grow older and older, until you are nothing but a tiny pile of dust. That's why. You're lying! You don't believe me? Stop it! Stop it! No! Go on. See what happens. Go on! Do you remember anything before the past three months? Do you have any memory outside of this house? Did you ever celebrate a birthday? You're not a real person. You're an idea. Listen, Shane, I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry. Will you read to me? - Where were you? - Out. - I called. - I know. - Listen, about what you heard on the phone... - I don't want to talk about it. Shane's asleep. Oh, good. Matt? Matt? Shane? Shane? Kate. Oh my God. Look, Mommy. I'm big now. Shane? It's not loaded. I know where you keep your bullets too! Shane, give me the gun. I hate you! No! No! Look at me, Shane. - You lied to me. - To protect you. You said we'd be together. Forever. Would you like that? Yes? - Yeah? - Yeah. It's gonna be okay. Come here. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. Stop! Stop it! Easy. Easy, easy. What happened? You hit your head. Where is Shane? Matt, where is he? He's dead. What? How? We were fighting for the gun and he... He got shot. Where is the body? I took it outside. It's okay. It's okay. Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate! What are we gonna do? About what? About this place. I don't think I can live here anymore. Why not? You have... food on your lip. Where can we go? We have no money, no jobs. At least here the room will provide. It's been hard, but we'll get over it. Eat your food. What do you wanna do? What are you doing ? - Is this what you like? - What? Stop? Don't worry, I saw you two do it. Hey, Mom. Help! Help! No! Kate. Honey, come on, we have to go. - Matt? - Yes it's me. Come on. He was just like you. Kate. No, no, no. Kate, don't listen to him, it's the room. Come with me. No, no, no, no. Don't listen to him. Kate, it's me. - No, Kate, come with me, come on. - Please. June bug. It's me. Yes, june bug. Come on, let's go. Shane. Shit. We're still in the room. It's playing with us. I've got an idea. Mommy? Daddy. Daddy! Mommy? It's okay, mommy. Mommy! No! Come on! Mommy! Mommy! Stop! Mother! Mommy! Please. Mommy. Honey, open up, I got you coffee. Kate. Kate. Kate! John Doe: Unidentified. A pseudonym, attached to an unidentified person.
