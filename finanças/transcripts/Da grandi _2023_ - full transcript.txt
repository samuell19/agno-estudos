"Of Venus and Mars you don't get married and you don't leave". Today is Friday, so you can't. Remember that in about ten years, I will choose your retirement home. And you remember, that in about ten minutes, we will choose your college. If it works. And do you like it? It runs, yes. Like a top. However! Phenomenon the little guy. So, goodbye. See you tonight if you like. Wait, let me think… She suits me. Activate fireproof front door. What? Turn it off, thank you. False alarm. I go to school, mom. Home automation two, Filippo zero. - Dad. - Huh? Did you forget something? No because? I have the phone, the wallet as well. I've got everything. Hurry it's late. My friends are coming tonight for a sleepover for my… My? Oh my, right. For your birthday. Best wishes, Marcolino. Excuse me. Hi love. HI. Guys, hurry up. I'll wait for you in the car. If you have a pajama party, where am I sleeping tonight? With mom and dad. Are not you happy? They are happy, at least I don't bathe all the Latvian. It's not my fault. Not mine either. - Did you train today? - Yes, two hours with my father. Guys, look. I'm going viral in America! It will be one to whom the like started by mistake. If I get to a million followers they pay me too. You only have us as followers. Here is the other follower. Ready? [Mark] Hello! Give me an M! Give me an A! Give me an R! Give me a C! Give me an O. - Many… - Congratulations… [together] Mark! Thanks friends. - Come on let's go. - [Leo] Yes! [Mark's thought] Francesca, I will always love you. I'll marry you when I grow up and we will be very happy. Okay. - Happy birthday, Mark. - Thank you. Thank you, but I would like you to write the essay. You were so good, what happened? Promise me you won't do it anymore? - All right. - Well. This is the Marco I like. [Marco] Pass it on, Ivan. You don't play with my ball. Everyone knows you're a goat and that you are the teacher's pet. It is not true! Goat you will be there. I'll tell you another. Do you know what he does every night? Pissing on the bed. [together] Piss in bed! - You're a liar. - His sister told my sister. [indistinct shouts] - Who did it? - [all] Him! Did you think? It's always you Poggi. But it was mine! See you in the presidency for a nice note. [headmaster] Hello, Francesca. Poggi punched me in the face. - If you want, I'll tell the Dean. - If anything, tell your grandparents. - This child is too lively. -He's unlucky, you know. He is not justified forever. "Sorry, I robbed a bank, but I'm so unlucky." [headmaster] How's the bed and breakfast? Well! I have only one free room. In fact, if you know someone… Frances, can i come and live with you? We'll talk about it when you grow up. But when I grow up I can come, it is confirmed? Yes, sure, it's confirmed. [principal] It is also confirmed that recess is over. You too, make it easier. Please. - At your orders, Mr. Headmaster! - Go. Did you like the whimsical? - [Serena] Well. - Sure, who doesn't love frozen pizzas? Here, good. - [Anna] I'll take the cake. - At least that's true. [Claudio] Listen, Signorino, the teacher told me that you no longer do your homework. How come? Hmm… At that time? Dad, don't yell at me now, there are my friends. I yell at you because I'm your father and I pay the mortgage on this house. Of course! You haven't paid him for two months. These are not your problems. When I speak you shut up and mute. Clear? It's clear? You said: "Shut up and be silent." I made a witty son. You too, though… frozen pizzas. Rotisserie and food they no longer give us credit. Want the details? You're weighing me down the collapse of real estate sales? I'll weigh you that you haven't sold one in months. And you're always around. I'm always around, but I don't enjoy it. [Serena] My stomach is growling. - We ask your brother for a loan. - What? Can I ask you, he's always had a soft spot for me. Do you bring the lighter? Which means: "He always had soft spot for me"? Here it is! But mom, did you do this to me? I don't like trifle. [Anna] Sorry, mom really forgot. - You like? - [together] No. - Indeed there is liquor. - Just a little. The important thing is to blow out the candles and make a wish. Exact. Dad, speaking of wishes, my present? - Huh? - My present? Your gift, of course! Mom took care of that, didn't she? Yes! We got you… nice suit! [Claudius] Wow! But what gift is a suit? You promised me the hoverboard. Marco, let's not start, that stuff costs too much. But what does it take? the money is taken from the ATM. No? They are taken from ATMs if you put them in first. Otherwise you have to apply for a loan. Why didn't you ask? Why didn't we ask? Now the trifle problem It's me? - Enough! I wanted the hoverboard. - [Claudio] Marco! [voicing confused] Where are you going? Marco! - [Anna] Where are you going? - [Tato] Wait for me. Compliments. That's enough, I don't want to see them anymore. Don't cry, we're here. Make room for us and let's sleep all in the same bed embraced. It doesn't suit you. Ivan told the truth, I still pee at night. I can not stand it anymore! I want to grow up. I can not wait either. Me too, actually. Do you tell me? Wait, I have an idea! - [Anna] Things change. - [Claudius] Yes? [Anna] Yes, they change over the years. So? - I became bourgeois, so what? - Exact. And anyway it's really true, I picked the wrong brother. Oh my, what did I say! Make a wish, come on. All together. [Serena] I will never play tennis again. [Tato] I won't let anyone sleep with mom. [Marco] I will finally marry Francesca. [Leo] I'm going to look for dad and mom, but first the Headmaster was swollen with a blow. [together] I want to grow up. Hey. Oh! Where are my friends? Who are you? I am Tato. I don't know where his friends are, sir. - But who is she? - I'm marco. This is my bedroom. [Leo] Will you let me sleep? But she because she is wearing Marco's pajamas? But… But you! But we… We have grown up! Here they are. These are already starting. I can't wait let this little boy grow up. [Marco] Serena, wake up. [Serena] No. It's Saturday, it's not fair. Serena, you've grown up. [Serena] Dad I'm sleepy, I don't feel like exercising. Serena, come on! [Tato] How much you've grown. And well as well. But what is it? - [shouts from Serena] - Mamma mia, what is it? Silvietta, go over there and tell him to shut up otherwise… Otherwise what? You don't have to be precise. Tell him, "Otherwise." They understand. Where has the real me gone? This isn't me. But yeah! Everyone is himself, we just grew up fast. Look here. How tall do you think I am? Let me see. - My hair has come out! - Let me see. Me too, look. I have lace like my father. Huh? Did you imagine yourself like this when you grew up? I? No, not like that. Instead you grew up well. Look how swollen you are here. Think about that which has swelled up to you. - Already. - [Leo] Show me. Wow! Crush it! -Yes, he got puffed up on me too. - It is not true! And you? Everyone look at your swellings, please. - You have to shut up, otherwise… - Go Go. Open up. It's also my room. You can't enter Silvietta, go away! Dad, are you in there? [together in a low voice] The voice! [in a shrill voice] No, what a dad! Just kidding, there's no dad here. I'm Marco, your brother. Puss away. Go away! Password? There never was. And now there is, check it out! Go away, spy dwarf. I just want my Ciccio Bello, Now I'm calling mom. No, what a mom! No. [Marco] Where is Ciccio Bello? There he is. Ciccio Bello. - Resolved. - But what solved? How do I get home? I've been making wishes for years and nothing ever happened. Now who tells my mom? Who tells my father? Today I had the Under 10 tournament. Where am I going like this? We can't be seen like this. Let's get dressed and run away. Okay. Come on! Guys, we have a problem. [whispering] Come on! Measure your clothes in the closets. - Shh! - Shh! Why your dad does he only wear ugly jackets? Since when do you know about fashion? Put on what you find that you like. [Anna] Guys, please. Hide! [Anna] What a password! They always want to joke. Guys, that's enough now. Boys? - Boys? - Mom! The little fish has become a tuna. It will just grow. With everything you feed him. But where are all the others? I don't know, in fact I'm looking for them. Maybe I'm at the playground playing. They were so rowdy this morning. Where is dad? Did he go to the park too? Dad comes back soon. Come on, come and have breakfast with mom. Good, love. [fails to whistle] [whispering] Get out! Hurry up! Take your clothes. - My mother's purse. - What are you doing? -[Serena] she notices it. - [Tato] You are a thief. [door opens] Hey? [Claudio] Bye, potato chip. How is it going? What you did seems normal to you with Marco's friends at home? Stop! You complain and criticize all the time. Come on! There is the little girl. "Come on! There's the little girl." But please. - Everything has become so small. - [Marco] The floor is so far away. You have to call me lei. You have to call me Mr… [Serena] Look, I'll take them all. Record! World champion. - Come on, come on! - [Tato] Below. No! [Marco] Wait. I have to do one thing. What does it do? Excuse me? Gentleman? - [Marco] I have to take this. - [clerk] But this what? Stop, the alarm sounds. Where you go? He stay still. - This is it. The hoverboard. - He can't take it from the showcase! - [Marco] Here's the money. - These are not enough. Mom only had these in her purse. - Mom? - Yes. Mom… Maybe she has a credit card? - No! - No. Mom? - Yes. - Yes! - Do you have an ATM? - [together] No! - Mom? - [together] Yes! So this stays here. Then mom comes by and pays. - Hand! - Yes. Yesterday I turned nine and no hoverboards. Now that I'm grown up, I wanted to buy it and the money is not enough. - Because she is ugly and mean! - Do not do that. - Excuse me… -She made him cry. Happy? - Did I make him cry? - It's not like that. It's not like that. - Ugly and bad. - Evil yes, but ugly no! - More ugly than bad. - [clerk] No, meaner. She's fine with us not calling the police. - Ugly and bad. - [Tato] He's right. People are crazy. Anna, I don't want her alms. Instead, if there is one thing what I like is almsgiving. - [mobile phone vibrate] - Who is? - Hello Carlo. - [Carlo] Hello, can you pass me Serena? Serena is not here they went down to the park to play. I'll jump in, so the recovery that today has a tournament. All right. HI. Maybe it didn't just happen to us. Maybe it happens to many children. Like that over there. [Marco] Maybe, in the first quarter was in second B. - What do You know? - [cell phone rings] Help. She is the mother, what do I do? Wait! Do not answer. If you answer think that you are a thief who stole the iPad. - But the iPad is mine. - But you are not you, for her. - Right! - Six… How disgusting. But you liked the fries. I didn't even like them before. I did it to spite… Excuse me? He. Have you seen a group of children? They are always together. They are three boys and a slightly chubby little girl. It's not me! - Yes, in fact I said children. - It's not us! - It's not us. - It's not us. - We are not children. - I understand. I was talking about small children… - We would have told him, right? It's not us. - It's not us. Thank you. Thank you. However, it is not said around that your daughter is chubby. Ninth! What do you want? Who knows you? [Anna] Commissioner, it's been eight hours that we have no news. I printed some photos of Marco. Thank you. We will need the photos other children too, of course. I send right away a message to others to warn them. [doorbell] - Novelty? - There's the police. - Jesus! Why? - I called her. However, I tell you, If something happened to Tato, I'll kill you. Let's hope there's no need. Excuse me, it was just like that. Don't say that, at least in front of me. Anyway, now we will broadcast the photos to all the patrols. We will find them playing in a park, definitely. In the one below nobody saw them today. I advise you to take a look, I have seen unsavory people. [Milena] He doesn't answer me. -[inspector] Does your son have a telephone? - No, an iPad. But he turned off the tracking. Do other children have cell phones? - Mark no. - Not even Serena. [Commissioner] Don't worry. They are just children who wanted to do something when they grew up. So, friends, I'm going to live with Francesca. - And U.S? - You manage. But you didn't say: "We will always be together"? These are things that are said as children. Then, when you grow up you know, everyone makes his own business. It was Francesca who told me to go to her. She confirmed it to me! Those are also things that are said. And then what do you tell him? Have you seen yourself? The truth. I will go to her and tell her: "Hello Francesca, I'm Marco Marinelli of the fourth B. I grew up suddenly and I'm coming to live with you." You are no more Marco Marinelli of the fourth B. - You look like an oversized janitor. - Oh! Serena, are you coming with me? So maybe you help me. Alright. HI. Friends, I have to go, the love of my life is waiting for me. She said we were always together. Relax, she will never make it. HI. What is your name? Silvia, but everyone calls me Silvietta. I do not like it. My name is Brunhild. Everyone calls me Bruna, but I prefer Brunhilda. May I ask you a question? If you are good yes. Your dad when she gets angry hit your brother? - No! - No. - Did you slap him yesterday? -No, but he yelled at him in front of everyone. Well, in short… What are you doing? It's still big. When will my little fish become small again? Don't worry, it's normal. You will grow up too. But I warn you that then baby won't go back, sadly. Candy? Yes. Yes? We have come for the announcement of the rented room. Hello, welcome. - [Serena] Permission. - Have you booked with the app? No, we came directly. I see. Are you the gentlemen? Gentlemen who? Are we the lords? We are the gentlemen. From today we are gentlemen, yes. No, he wants to know the name. Marco. Does he also have a last name? Yes, I have a surname, but it's very different. It's totally different. In fact it is… Aladdin! Mark Aladdin. Aladdin? Like my favorite cartoon. Come on? Also… Francesca Martini, pleasure. Are you Mrs. Aladdin? - No, we are not married. - We could not. We were staying with our parents until this morning. Ah here. - Anyway pleasure, I'm Rihanna. - Rihanna? It would be Ariadne, but I call myself Rihanna because she is my favorite singer. I like her very much too. I'll show you the house. Yes. [Francesca] This way. - The shared kitchen. - [woman] Hi! -She got hurt. She-she She must have been scalded by the tea. Here! Yes, teacher. I mean, are you a teacher? Yes, how does she know? At school we found this… Do you have children in any class? - We? Children? - No, no children. We are just friends. But from first grade. For a lifetime then. No, since first grade. - Yes. - Because how many years does it give us? She must be in her fifties, right? I do not know. Are you asking me? I less than him. What does he say, less? You are kidding me or did you drink? - Drank? - What a drink! - We can't drink. - They don't give it to us. - [Serena] That's nice. - Yes, this is the living room. I'll show you the room. Please. - [together] Thank you. - Please. - Thank you. Come on! -Yes! Yes. I have free this double. Should I sleep with him? - [Francesca] Is that a problem? - He still pees the bed! Ninth! - No… - Do you have incontinence problems? It's not to tell me about her, but her facts are hers and the sheets are mine. No, she's making fun of me because I peed my bed but when I was a child! Just think, it seems like yesterday! She looks at how many clothes. Yes they were left here from previous guests. -But she doesn't get up? - No, they're shelves. Fixed. They don't slip off, no. Excuse me! I remembered to be in word with another person, I'm not sure to be able to leave the room. But how, she had said that he gave it to us. And where are we sleeping tonight? And what do I know? [doorbell] Excuse me. I will be right back. [Francesca] Here I am! - Claudio, what's going on? - HI. Marco, he ran away from home! We can't find it anymore. [Claudio] We looked for him everywhere. It's dad! We've been up to now with the police. Run away from home? When? He ran away from home, yes. I don't know, this morning I think. It's my fault! Yesterday was his birthday and I treated him very badly. I scolded him in front of his little friends. - Come here. - My love, please help me. But what… But who kisses her? Did she kiss her? She kissed her! She kissed, did you see? She kissed! I have two people there for a room, I will be right back. With mouths they kissed. Excuse me? [Francesca] What's wrong with her? No, it is that she has received bad news about her father, and… Something serious? - Serious? - Yes. Very serious! [Francesca] I'm sorry.

Here they are, they are all. I'm from mom. - Are your parents still supporting you? - Of course! Certainly! But by law. Thanks for giving us the room. - Please. - Ma'am, but… - Martinis. - Martinis! Ms. Martini. [incomprehensible] Shut up! - [clerk] See you tomorrow guys. - [servants] See you tomorrow. But it's heaven! No, it's hell for you! - You are dead! - No, I have the interstellar shield! [phone vibrates] Hello, who is this? [in artificial voice] Your husband is kissing with Marco's teacher. Yes I know. [Anna] But don't tell him, we already have too much trouble. But how do you know? But how does he know? But he doesn't have to know. He knows! But how does he know? He's crazy! He knows! Has the situation worsened? Very aggravated. My mother knows! He knows. - Would you like some herbal tea? - Herbal tea? I hate herbal tea! Herbal tea at this time? I want chocolate with spray cream. - I don't have any spray cream. - Here you are! it seemed to you! I don't have the spray! So my dad… that's fine, but my mother knew it! I ask for the spray chocolate, "No I don't have it, I have herbal tea". I don't want herbal tea. I don't want it! I want chocolate with spray cream! I'll buy the spray cream tomorrow, okay? Do you swear? I swear. And here? But they are crazy! But what are you doing here? Wakes up! big babies! But what are you doing here? You will have done a thousand euros of damage. - We didn't do it. - [clerk] Who did it? - Don't tell the principal. - But what principal? I call the neuro, you are crazy. Ouch! [Francesca] More coffee? - Coffee? - No, one question. Teacher, by chance you would have placed for two of our friends? So, in the meantime, call me Francesca, ok? Unfortunately I have no place, because they stay another week. They? I'm off to work, see you later. Did you understand? They stay another week. - Oh! - Huh? You understand that they stop another week? Another week. The bucket is full! Let's begin! Slow down! [man and woman shouts in German] Another week? - Did they leave without saying anything? - Yes. They said something but in German, we didn't understand anything. - [Mark] No. - Damn, we didn't need it. And then teacher, as it happens, those friends of ours came to visit us they were looking for a room, do you remember? Yes. Hello, pleasure. I am Ronaldo. And I more. I am… Thor! Nothing less! So, welcome. - Very good, Thor. - Good boy! Playing with such big hands it's very easy. - Whose piano is it? - It belonged to my grandmother, as well as the house. I took a few lessons, but… I learned on Youtube. What do I play to you? Achilles Lauro? Mom always listens to it on the radio, but I don't know them. - How old is your mother? - Thirtyfive. - Thirty-five, when Thor was born. -She had some. She has many more, at least double! Play us something we all know. ♪ Peppina's coffee ♪ ♪ she doesn't drink in the morning ♪ ♪ Neither with milk nor with tea ♪ ♪ But why, why, why? ♪ ♪ Peppina makes coffee She makes coffee with chocolate ♪ ♪ her Then she puts jam on it Half a kilo of onions ♪ ♪ Four or five candies Seven Butterfly Wings ♪ ♪ And then she says: "What coffee!" ♪ ♪ Peppina's coffee You don't drink in the morning ♪ ♪ Neither with milk nor with tea, But why, why, why? ♪ But why, why, why?

She is also my teacher and I like her too, I've always liked her. You never liked her! And then it's not worth it these things are said as children. It's too easy to say things afterwards. But where is it written? Every time I see her, something moves inside me. But if she's always disliked you because she put you low to the class assignment! She wants to reject me to spend another year with me! [Marco] Now I'll kill you! - [Leo's moaning] - Bastard! [Marco] You have to surrender! [Teo] What are you doing? Stop it!

What am I, sorry? You are gay, aren't you? [verse of observation] AND… gay, in the sense of… Come on! Do you want to give me some piano lessons? - I'm in. - [Francesca] Ok. Ronaldo, if you are homophobic, you and I are going to have a big problem. No, but I don't… What am I? - Man... - [Francesca] Homophobic. I don't know what homophobic means. Homophobe is a bad person who can't stand gays. Ugly person! Later! What does gay mean? [electronic assistant] The adjective gay, defines in common usage, a preference towards people of their own sex. I have always preferred males to females, which by the way we have always said that make us sick. Thank you! Excluding you who are in the group. I did not understand. Am I only gay? Don't you prefer boys? Do you prefer… That is, if one wants to be… Precisely… [together] No! But are you sure? Of course we are sure! Because you feel different now from before? No, I'm the same. It's you who grow up you have become different. I sleep with Tato tonight, you do as you please. [Serena] Hello. - [Serena] Come on, come on. - We are different. Understood? I felt it. they are four, they cannot be gone. Before Saturday they are often in the videos and then disappear. You can't even see them leaving the house. Where have these kids gone? Can you explain to me why we came here? I make him lose his temper to punish always and only me! That suspends you, indeed, denounces you! You didn't say you were homesick, that you wanted to go back to school? If I told you the truth you didn't accompany me. Sorry, Enza! I mean, janitor I don't know. No, but she is Enza! She has the face of Enza. Is the principal in the office? No! They are all in assembly. Four little boys have disappeared. But you don't have a TV? Like TV? I leave the floor to the Commissioner who will ask you some questions. Please. Good morning guys, as you know some of your comrades are no longer to be found. They are: Serena Lombardi, Leo Poggi, Tato Verdini and Marco Marinelli. When someone disappears the police are called. And we are the police. But so do we we need your help. If you know or have an idea where could they be… - We did it big this time. - Come to us and tell us, because it could be very important to find them. All right? [pupils] Yes, that's fine. I realized that this student of mine, Marco, he was in love with me. Did you notice? Yes, but I didn't know whether or not to tell her parents. I told him and finally I fell in love with the father. Funny, isn't it? No not at all. Where does this lead? To the old palace shelters. [Marco] Rihanna! You can't interrupt like this, we are talking about important things. Please. You were talking about this father, explain to me. You know, it's the first time I'm with a married man. I didn't think it was that complicated. Is it complicated why does he scold you? No! Indeed, she is very kind. And I don't know if she does it because she loves me, or because she feels guilty. - You know what I mean? - No! But I think she's at fault very guilty! Who knows what this tube is for. I told you not to interrupt! We are talking about something important. The door, the tube… Please! Sorry, did you say? May we know what you want to do in your home? Now I fix them! - Who? - Those who sleep with mom. - And how many are there? - One at a time, but change them often. Meanwhile, I'm hitting today's one, maybe word will get out. You can't beat up adults. Go to jail! You speak that you wanted to hit the Headmaster. He now it's my turn. And you give me a hand. [Milena] Who is it? Police. - Good morning. - Good morning, ma! But you are Signora Verdini, right? Yes, have you heard from my son? We are investigating. Are you at home alone? No, I'm with a friend. We are here for him indeed. But Tato hardly knows him. And this is serious. Because he means that he is at home with a stranger. It's not done. Can you call us please? - Yes. - Go, go. Now super Tato shows it to him! - We just have to scare him. - Yes. Good morning, can I help you? Good morning. Is there any problem? Problem? Ninth! No problem. I'll handle that. Her name is? - Philip. - Like Philip the Fair, the King of France. - We studied it. - Yes, yes. - Are you a resident here? - No, I live in Milan. - If you live in Milan, stay in Milan. - I'm here for work. You can't stay in other people's houses. It's forbidden! May I ask for your badges? You can ask what you want. Except for the badges, they don't give them to us anymore. They put microchips under our skin. Sounds like bullshit to me, sorry. One, you don't swear. Two, shall we call the police? - Which is you. - That's us. You came for me, okay. Can you explain to me why? Is there something about the little boy? Tato. His name is Salvatore, but Tato is fine. Have you ever threatened him, offended him? On the contrary, I believe that that idiot has it with me. Write, you fool, he offended him before witnesses. Scemetto is a term of endearment. I like it silly, it's not serious. Is not serious? It's very serious! You are in very bad shape. And you're not too well today either. [intercom] Excuse me for a moment. Were you waiting for someone? As far as I know, no. Who is? They are your colleagues. - Policemen? - [Milena] Who else? We have a double parked car. Come on, otherwise they'll fine us. Come, sergeant, come. [Tato and Leo] Goodbye. Don't worry, Tato is fine. And how does she know? Huh? I… Bad news comes quickly, she didn't come, so she means she's fine. [Leo] Come on. Until we meet again. Congratulations on this dressing gown, matches the color of the eyes, she is just perfect. - Thank you. - Bye Philip, see you soon. Do you want to play Monopoly? [Marco, Tao and Leo] Yes! Can someone help me first? Yes. Don't start without me. I am the cylinder. What do I have to do? I wash and you dry? Dry, yes. - But do you like being a teacher? - Rihanna, please give me your name. Sorry… sorry. Anyway Yes, even if sometimes they are too lively… And they end up at the principal. [Francesca] Indeed. But I couldn't be without them. I'm very worried for these pupils who have run away from home. Some pupils have escaped, and who are they? Their names are Leo, Tato, Marco, and Serena. [Francesca] They are very good friends. But if these four children, they were in a very high tower 300, 700 meters high, with a ravine below, and you had to throw them away… - Throw them? - Throw them… Throw them, strangle them… In short, all but one must die, who would you save from the tower? For a teacher they are all the same. - All equal. - [together] Eh! I can tell you, I have a soft spot for Marco. He is too sweet. Marco… Have you heard? She has a soft spot for Marco! Tie! Is there some glue? - Can you remove a curiosity from me? - Yes. - What work do you do? - What a job! We go to school… - We're unemployed. - [Marco] Unemployed. I am sorry. What did you do before? - Children. - Children. No, I'm the nephew. I understand. If you want, I can help you look for a job. I say it also in my interest, I can't keep you here unless you pay me. - What studies did you do? - Third year. All promoted. Everyone. - Everyone. - Everyone. I mean, all four the third? We also wanted to finish the fourth, but it was not possible. In fact, in my opinion we lose the year. But is there anything you understand? Something you would like to do? Yes! The video game tester. I the pop star. I the astronaut. And I the superhero, gay! Okay! Maybe we start with more normal jobs. Incoming helicopter. Received. Thanks, base. K-15 at Aquila 17. I know it sounds a little eccentric, she has had a busy life. He was a footballer the fighter pilot, the Formula One mechanic and more. - Now he's having a bit of a bad time. -But have you ever taken care of children? No, but in my opinion she has a natural talent. Trust me. [Mark] No! Okay. - Defend yourself, if you can… - Pinuccio? Then we go. - Hello Mom. - [Francesca] Good job! And now Pinuccio, defend yourself if you dare! Bang! [groaning] Tell Francesca… that I love her. - So he's your new… - No! No, my pleasure. Let's go. [Carlo] Excellent, good. Let's bounce the ball and we throw it straight, okay? HI! Hello can I ask you something? Go play over there for a moment, I'll be right there. [Carlo] Hello, do we know each other? No. My name is Rihanna. Rihanna, pleasure. I'm Carl. How can I help you? I'm looking for work but I only know how to play tennis. Do you have a teacher card? No, but my father said that I am better than the teachers. Sure we don't know each other you have something familiar. We don't know each other. Anyway, how much do you pay here? I need the money for the room. The right one, but without a card I don't know if… Let's play a set, if I win, you hire me. Wow. She is very light, I beat. Fifteen to zero. Am I hired? - [Francesca] Professor Poggi. - Good morning teacher. Is there any news? No, unfortunately not. After Leo's escape, Grandma hardly gets out of bed anymore. And I had vision loss. How do I take care of it, doing all the chores… I'm sorry professor, if he needs a hand I can spread the word. Let's hope. Wait, maybe I have the right person. Mr. Ronaldo, we didn't expect a man. Sincerely. I can't do anything about this, but I'm very good. And then I know all about you. Excuse me in what sense? You, Mrs. Martha, loves reruns of Mrs. Wrong, She Wrote and documentaries on felines. She specializes in cannelloni, very good but not digestible, she loves to water the plants and ride a horse, but she has osteoarthritis. She goes into the woods to look for mushrooms but she is denied and she does not find them. You, Signor Ugo, smoke a pipe, she watches all the basketball games, she plays burraco online but she loses and says it's a conspiracy, hates walking in the woods, but he goes there to please his wife. He reads long and boring novels and he taught to read to his nephew at four years old. Did he investigate us? No, she is a dowry, I understand people from small clues. Like Sherlock Holmes. And now hide. Now I find you. All in position. Great Cuda! Go. Good. Go. Very, very good. Did you bring your shopping money? - Yes. - All right. First one very important thing. Grand Prix. Olé! Ready Set Go! [Serena] Let's go. Go. Crazy! But what are you doing? [clerk] What are you doing? [Anna] Can you hang these posters? Mom! I'm the mom of one of the TV kids. - They disappeared. My child… - [cashier] Of course, ma'am. They walked away. Thank you. Thanks for the shopping. If we have a party, we're good to go. Please, Frances. I'm glad you have a job and what you earn. But sorry. He plays, she plays tennis, he plays with the children, the only one who works is me. Can we trade? But I miss at all. You always want my stuff. Grandparents are yours and you keep them. They will also be fond of it, that would be wicked. [Francesca] Yes indeed. You know, Ronaldo, they really needed someone to help them. The nephew drove them crazy. A disaster! - Did they say so? - More or less. Marco, I found you a new client. Well! Thank you. I'm happy, I'm happy. - Sorry, I don't know why I did it. - No, don't worry. Do it when you want, well… And who is this new customer? I know, I miss it too. You will see that he will come back soon. Silvietta? Mom goes shopping. Hello Mom. - Are you waiting for the babysitter? - Yes. - Hi, are you Marco? - HI. Yes, I'm Mark. I didn't think you were that big. It was not my fault. At some point I became like that. In what if… Are you Marco the new babysitter? The new babysitter, yes. I'm not Mark, I'm Marco the new babysitter. Ah! Okay. - I'm Anna, pleasure. - Pleasure. - I'm the mother of… - Marco's. - About Marco and Silvietta. - Silvietta! And inside is my husband Claudio. He today he stays at home. Yes. He stays at home, yes. We will see each other later. - Yes. - I go. - Later! HI. - Later. - [Claudio] Good morning, welcome. - Good morning. Don't mention Francesca in here. We understood each other? We understood each other. But why is she cheating on mom… the mother of her children? But how dare you? Mind your own business. But it's my business. You tell me if you have to lecture me. Are you her boyfriend? Unfortunately not. Ah, now that explains everything. You're jealous? - Let's go. - Here. And how do you know? If you haven't changed the room, it's from here. Silvietta! How are you? Leave me! How clingy you are. Can you play with Legos? I am the Lego world champion. Silvietta, dad is going out. Be a good girl. - Look, for a snack you give her… - Oat milk and Nesquik. - Exact. Find everything in… - Top right, in the kitchen. How do you know, sorry? The Nesquik is always at the top right. There is coarse salt, oil and then the Nesquik. Alright. I go. Hello, go. At that time… I can not believe it! The hoverboard! Stopped! What are you doing? I want to open it to play with. Don't touch it, it's my brother's. Maybe your brother likes it if someone opens it and plays with it, right? If I touch him, then when he comes back he gets angry and makes me cry. Did he make you cry often? Yes, but if he comes back I don't make him angry anymore. But you never made him angry. I promise you, if your brother comes back, he won't make you cry anymore. And why doesn't he come back? Why… Because he can't. - And what do you know? - I know. I'm a babysitter with superpowers. We play with Legos, that are in that blue basket. - How do you even know that? - I have super powers! - My daughter ate in secret. - I know… that is, I guess. I wanted her to succeed where I failed. Why, did you play tournaments? But you never told me. When should I tell you, sorry? I was a promise. I didn't keep it, but anyway... That's why I ended up being a teacher. You, rather, if you had been competitive you could have been strong. Dad forced me, but it didn't suit me so much. I hope you don't have it still with him, after years… But you have no idea of the sacrifices that must be made. I gave up everything, I also work at night. Since my wife left me, it's… But why did she leave? If I may ask. It's not a great story. She's Canadian, we've been together for a month when she got pregnant. Then overnight she returned to Canada. Do you understand the crazy? And she left me alone with Serena that she was a couple of months old. She is my whole life. But she knows that she hates me. But she could not understand these things. And then she didn't know them either, perhaps. Yes, sorry, I didn't mean to. Is that… Then, when you want, we hug. All right? Yes. When you want too, in the sense… Look, do you fancy one of these days? to go out to dinner? - In what sense? Me and you? - Yes, the two of us. But you and I like boyfriends? Like Lady and the Tramp? Yes No! Without exaggerating, then who knows… I don't want it to sound like a cliché, but with you I really feel at home. Too much at home. Too much at home. - No. - Too home! At home it was a metaphor… I don't know what a metaphor is, but too much at home. - But then: "Hug me when you want"? - Too much at home. - Alright. - HI. [inaudible] - Everything OK? - Yes. She fell asleep right away because she was tired. - But we had a lot of fun. - That's better. Since her brother ran away he is in a bad mood. She is very close to her brother Marco. He is the love of my life… And he knows it. Does he know? Yes. Or maybe not. You say? Sometimes I'm a little hard on him, to make it react. He is wrong! Wrong. You don't make children react like that. You must never be harsh. - No? - No. Children need to be taken care of caressed, pampered. Then they have to be eaten feed yourself with good things, chocolate, candies and lots of chips. And then the gifts. But not clothes, shoes… What are they doing to us? Toys. Lots of toys. And not just at Christmas, no. - So they spoil themselves too much. - No! No. Indeed, far from it. "They spoil themselves" is an idea of ​​the grown-ups. - Children should be given gifts. - You say that because you're an expert? Babysitter! Too bad I didn't meet you sooner. Marco would have liked you so much. - But where did my husband find you? - From Frances. From Frances… Yes, Francesca, but not… Not Francesca Francesca… Another Frances. Someone I think is called Carla… Don't worry, I know everything anyway. However, they broke up thankfully. - Did they break up? - Yes. - Yes? - Since Marco ran away, my husband and i got back together we got back together. - And go! Go… - What enthusiasm. Yes, I'm happy. How come? Because I am passionate of happy families. - Especially this one. - Thank you. Please. [Leo] It's ready on the table. We come. [Leo] Here we go. Thank you. There's a little mess but then I fix it. Here you are. What have you prepared good? [Leo] First of all… Tuna sandwiches, tomato, double mayonnaise and oregano. Yummy. Second… Fried chicken nuggets. - Ah! - Very fried. Too fried? I'm a little curious Is there a dessert by any chance? Well! There I surpassed myself. I got the Smarties! Smarties are good. Ah… I also ironed. There's this shirt… here's a little hole. But he puts it in his pants Can not see it. A question. Have you ever been a caregiver before? No. You are my primary caretakers. I could have sworn it. Two guinea pigs. But if one doesn't start he never learns. My grandmother always says that. I always say that to my nephew too. Come with me as I teach you how to use the iron. But lunch? Patience. Excuse me mister Ronaldo, two minutes for the iron to heat up. Thanks for not kicking me out. Please. This house feels empty without my nephew. - He was a good nephew. - Not at all! He made us damn. But then she will know him. But he was so smart. Nice, joyful, funny and curious. He lately he had decided to go and look for parents in India. Maybe it's someone who if he decides one thing, then he succeeds. That's not the case. Why? My son and his wife, they had a serious accident when Leo was still little. We haven't found it yet the courage to tell him. So I'm not in India? No. They went off the road by motorcycle to the Argentario. What does he do? No, excuse me… But no, dear. I didn't know she was so sensitive! Excuse me. Did you also lose your parents when you were young? Yes, by motorcycle to the Argentario. - What a coincidence! - What a bad coincidence. [grandmother] I'm sorry. Francesca, but now that I'm gay, Ronaldo and Marco Will they still be my friends? Of course! And can I still hold their hands? This maybe not. You are no longer children. Indeed. Darnit. Who do you tell. There's someone I'd like to introduce you to. - I think you might like it. - Is he someone who likes to hold hands? Maybe! Would you like to teach me this piece on the piano? But follow me! That is, follow your student… - Tato. - Tato's name! Half of Italy follows him since he ran away. Two million followers. How good! He apologizes for a moment. Watch. I became an influencer! No, Tato has become an influencer. You are Thor, you can no longer post any videos. - Come on let's go. - It's the last time. Yes we go. [clears throat] Francesca, Marco wanted to know if you want to be with him. Yes. You won Mark. You're a genius you make her say it. You can tell Marco that we leave first and then let's see how it goes. - Marco, Francesca said that… - I heard. She heard. [Mark] Thank you. [Leo, crying] Hi guys. Why are you crying? Mom and dad died. Oh my, how did this happen? A motorcycle accident at the Argentario. Eight years ago. I am sorry… But is it still like this? Watch! Watch! We… That is, they are the ones who… A new trail has opened which will lead to a breakthrough in the investigation. But we also go… I didn't mean to alarm you ahead of time, but at this point we are certain whether it's a kidnapping. [Carlo] Like a kidnapping? We have no money, we are not rich. Me niether. But why? What do they hope to achieve? Let her talk, please. Commissioner, even if he knows nothing, tell us what he knows. We know something. If the children had escaped on foot, they would not have escaped to neighborhood cameras. [Commissioner] They are present until Saturday and then nothing. We found a bag with torn children's pajamas, - sign of a probable scuffle. - Like a fight? There were no traces of blood, so no big deal. They weren't on the bag fingerprints of children. - Only those of an adult. - Oh, Jesus! Which don't match to any registered criminal. But why did they kidnap them? This is a good question. Honestly it is incomprehensible. In Italy it is about 20 years that there is no kidnapping. Today between interceptions, GPS, cameras, kidnapping someone is almost impossible. So, Commissioner, you are telling us that you will find them soon? Right? Yes, we are working on it. But this person turns out not to have a cell phone, a credit card, a debit card, a name, a surname. Here, if he hadn't left those footprints, I would say… that this person does not exist. - [Tato] Stick it right! - [Mark] Yes. Ninth. She is so crooked! - But she's in good shape! -No, she's fine… Guys are we going? Yes. Why did you choose the amusement park? Why, when you go out where do you go? No, it was like that, so to speak. The amusement park is great. Indeed, sorry for the wait. Usually my friend is punctual. Conrad! HI. He is Marco, and he is Thor instead. Thor! What a beautiful name. Powerful. Corrado and I work at the same school. He is a modern headmaster… You see, modern. Not to brag, but the students love me. - Yes? - I imagine! Thor, on the other hand, is a very good pianist. - Let's go? - Yes. You know, I want a man who never forgets the child in him. be it big, but at the same time very sweet. I don't know if you understand me. - Big, but very sweet. - Yes. I understand. I will be right back. Marco? Marco? But who are you? So mysterious, with this name… A difficult question. - Can I bring the justification? - Certain. A curiosity of mine. But at school they know that… Frances only. And why? Hard question. Can I bring the justification? Here it is! Big and very sweet. Thank you! They didn't give me a lollipop for thirty years. Thank you. Did you prefer cotton candy? You have not forgotten the child in you? And who forgets it? Why do you hole the balloons? And how do you know? All the principals pierce the balls. Well, sometimes you have to puncture a ball otherwise the children do not understand. In my opinion, if you don't pierce them, children understand better. Children understand everything. In my opinion, you pierce them because you are not happy. But I'm happy. You don't tell lies. I know, but sometimes with a lie everything is easier. - Eye. - At what? [shout] Soon it will be dark… Maybe it's best to go home. Are you afraid of the dark? No. And you? What are you afraid of? Well… As a kid I was scared… of the black man. From my father, a lot. And then, I had… - I'm gay! I'm gay! - Me too! And here we are… And here we are. - Shall we go back to the amusement park tomorrow? - Certain. We come back when you want. But aren't you cold without pajamas? Yes a bit'… Do you warm me up? Shall we light a stove? - You come. - I? You come! And what do I warm you up with? She wanna play a little with me? With the paddle? Without pallet. The scoop… I understand. I understand! Close your eyes. Close your eyes, don't open them. Don't cheat. - How many? - I do not know. They were four. - Turn around a little, like this. - As? One to zero for me. - No, go away. This is mine! - Ouch! [indistinct lines] I mean, I'm an orphan like Harry Potter. And I'm a kitchen boy like Cinderella. - That she was an orphan too. - Indeed. But I can't work anymore because my father he wants to get engaged to me. The Headmaster wants to be engaged to me. It seems worse to me. You'll be happy Mark that you got engaged to the teacher. - In short… - Why then? Why… Except with this kissing thing who always wants to give me, which also puts us tongue wet with saliva, and it disgusts me. Then, tonight she even wanted to wrestle in bed. Handsome! Who won? - Nobody, it's not like there are points. - Of course? - No! - What are you doing to fight? That's what I told her too. And then, at some point, she wanted to undress, she's taken off all of her dressing gown. Indeed, in my opinion, she caught a cold. Let's face it, being big sucks. It's worse than trifle. Guys, look! We're back on TV. Let's hear what he said Commissioner Giardone. Unfortunately, at this point we are certain that the children have been kidnapped. I can't reveal anything yet, but the investigations are going on, the circle around the kidnappers it is tightening. It is not true that we have been kidnapped. But then who are the culprits? What does this idiot say? I really know that we are the culprits… We! …within 24-48 hours maximum we will catch these criminals. These are the only unknowns that have come out from the building on the day of the disappearance. But it doesn't seem like it that they have children bonded with them. I see it, Lo Cascio. I see… But they are the only four who don't live there. In fact, they have thug faces. Faces of morons. And that's what worries me the most. Come on! We have to help the police to find the children. That's us. Yes I know. You understand that we risk going to prison for the rapture of ourselves? Well? We tell them who we are. It won't be banned turn into big ones. They will never believe it. Marco is right, to go out from this story there is only one way. - These four kids… - That it's still us. - Yes… - [together] They have to come back! Guys, I was wondering, if there is a spell… There will be a counter-spell. So… Attention. [in chorus] I want to be little again. I want to be small again. I want to be small again! But what are you doing in my room? I told you to count to a thousand. I can only count to ten. Why did I have four of you come today? - Today there is an offer. - Yes, yes. Buy one and get four. The three of them are free. Now go back to watching TV. I follow you, come on! I'll join you. You are Leo, you are Tato, you are Serena and you are Marco! All right, I'm Marco. How did you guess? The little fish has become a tuna, and you know where my toys are. How badly have you aged though. Thank you. But how did you do it? Did she help you a fairy? No… We made too strong a wish and we met like this. - Eh… - Who knows how many things you can do now. I don't go to school anymore, I'm engaged, I have a job and I don't pee the bed anymore. But now we have a lot of problems. We have to earn a lot of money to pay for the house, the things… And the police think we've been kidnapped. - But you have not been kidnapped, you are here! - [Marco] Eh! But, sorry… What do you ask when you are kidnapped? - Excuse me. - Apologizes… When you are kidnapped, what do you ask for? - Where have the kidnapped people gone. - Even that. But what are the kidnappers asking for? The ransom! - Good! The ransom. - [Leo] The ransom. How to ask the ransom for kidnapped children? [female voice] I do not understand. Rephrase the question. [spelling] How to ask the ransom for kidnapped children? [female voice] I do not understand. Rephrase the question. Leave him alone, I know how to do it anyway. I've seen it done in a movie. The problem is not asking for a ransom. But when they give us money, how do we give them children? That's us. You always have to say it. - Meanwhile we keep the money. - And how much do we ask? Very, very much. Five hundred euro? Five hundred euro? But what 500 euros. It's little! If we ask for little, they think we are not good kidnappers. We have to ask a lot… One thousand Euro! No more! One thousand and two… One thousand… Three thousand! Three thousand per child! What three thousand a child is… [incomprehensible words] Twelve thousand euros! Twelve thousand euros, with a ten thousand discount. Unless they arrest us first. Everything OK? You seem a little strange to me today. AND… No, it's just that I worked a lot today. I played with the kids all day and so I'm a little tired. Ninth. No fight today i have a bit of a headache. Okay. Good night. We kidnapped Marco, Leo, Serena and Tato too. If you don't give us ten thousand euros, we cut off their ears and then we kill them. - We kill them. - We kill them! Not "the". The without the G. After the detachment. Bring them to us! [she can't articulate the words] Bring them to us tomorrow in five euro banknotes. At noon at the iron bridge. Why the iron bridge? Why these things they are done in isolated places. Don't always interrupt me! Iron bridge, near the school. But school with the C. - Write it yourself if you are so good. - Shh! What have we done to you now? said the teacher that if you treat me badly it's homophobia. But it is not that nothing more can be said to you. And by the way, even if you like them for boys, school is written with a C. [door closing] Mission accomplished. -Did anyone see you? - To me? You know me, don't you? Do you know him? He is Silvietta's babysitter. Fingerprints on the pajama bag are hers. - He's the kidnapper. - He? But I left them house keys as well. Like house keys? We have also identified accomplices… The other two! They showed up at my house pretending to be cops! But who are they? The one with the beard he is our caregiver. Which cares little and badly. That's the new teacher of tennis in my club. Sorry, I'm not understanding. What's the point of all this? First they kidnap the children and then they come into your life? Logically, it should be the other way around. Excuse me, it is clear that they are fools, what are you waiting for to arrest them? No, these are dangerous, just because you fools. The ridiculous amount they asked for for ransom is proof of that. Let me do my job, I have a plan. And what would this plan be? Simple. We take the ransom money, we bring them here to our lair, and then we split them up. Seems a little too simple to me. If they follow us? They follow us… But we have the children hostage. "We have" is a misnomer. We have… Anyway, we have to go in mask and in the car. - It is true. - But if we don't even have a driving licence. They won't arrest us for that. Come on then. Courage. Let's go. Are you coming with me, Tato? If I have to. And how do we get there? In my father's car. [Marco] Did you bring the money? I am here. How are the children, Mr. Aladdin? [Marco] But I'm not Aladdin, I am an old woman. - Old… - [Commissioner] Stop it. We know very well who it is, we know many things about her. Including the fact that she appears to be a very good babysitter. [Mark] Ah… I see you are informed. You know how to do your job well, but we know how to do it we too do our job. That would? [Tato] Kidnapping children. By profession. - Can I get rid of this pigeon that doesn't… - Alright, take it off. I wasn't breathing, sorry. open! We want to check. It's the ten thousand you asked for. All in fives. Now tell us where the children are. And what are we going to tell you? We'll tell you in an hour, an hour and a half... - Whenever we want! - Here you are! [Marco] When we will be safe. - Go. - Huh? [Marco] And don't follow us. And don't follow us! [Tato] Otherwise our accomplices… they kill the children. Because our accomplices they are very bad. Badder than Jafar. - Badder than Ursula. - Moreover. Badder than Cruella Demon. - But worse… - Enough! - Yes, that's enough. - Baddest of all. Enough. We go. [Commissioner] Comfortable. Badder than Cruella Demon. Commissioner, but we let them go away like this 'sti runaways from home? I always have that plan, Lo Cascio. Memories? [Lo Cascio] In fact I was saying… No! But what is it? But damn… Of course! The policemen they're not dumb like us. Calm! Now we wash and clean ourselves. Let's hurry first let Frances arrive! If you take this stuff off. We breathe, we have all the time. And if in did they put a beacon on it? - [together] "Beacon"! - Yes, signalman. We would have noticed, right? If they followed us. [commissioner from loudspeaker] Surrender. You are surrounded! Free the children without harming them and I promise you a discount on your sentence. Come out with your hands up. Commissioner! Thermal scan indicates that inside there are only the kidnappers. - There is no sign of the children. - Better. Guys in position. Wait for my signal. Excuse me. Excuse me, but what's going on? It seems that the kidnappers of the TV children, hid in that apartment. - That? - Yes. They say a teacher lives there. Well yes! Inside! I can't see them anymore, what's going on? [Commissioner] What's going on? - [policeman] Commissioner, they fled. - Shit! How nice, we are all blue like the Smurfs. Yes, I was looking forward to Smurfette while the police are looking for us! Guys, this is the door to the shelters. We have to open it. Careful! Are you sure there is an exit? No. Let's go! Commissioner. The lady says she to be the owner of the house. [Francesca] Yes. I have a bed and breakfast. - They seemed to me decent people. - The explanations later. - Does the house have another exit? - Certain. - Where does it lead? - In that building over there. - Excuse me? - Please. The car! The car! To thief! To thief! - Thief! - Guys it's them, let's follow them. [Tato] We did it! Yes indeed! we are wanted, colored by smurfs, on a stolen car. It's just missing the loudspeaker on the roof that says: "Women, the kidnapper has arrived, he kidnaps the children." We want to add that we have no papers or money? [Leo] Watch out! - [Marco] Drift left. - [Serena] Watch out! They have very little stain. Are you dumb? What if there is a beacon? They would put it in the briefcase, not in the money. What would this beacon look like? It's like a phone sim. Similar to this? Are you crazy? I'll kill you! - This is homophobia! - Then I'll beat you up. - Homophobia and bullying! - Serena, beat him. - [Tato] Ouch! - [Marco] Guys, calm down. Maybe she was disabled, come on! And then nobody follows us, I think. [police siren] [Leo] You feel bad. Brace yourselves. [shout] [Marco] Brace yourselves! - [Leo] What are you doing? - [Marco] Hold on! [shout] [Marco] This is worth at least a hundred points. [Serena] What are you doing? If I don't get them all I lose the bonus and my power does not recharge. - [Serena] Who told you that? - [Marco] It's the regulation! [Marco] Attention, drift to the right. - Brace yourselves! - [shout] - A truck! - Brake! Truck with trailer. Worth at least 50 points! And out one. Next time we'll steal an off-road vehicle. There won't be a next time. [Tato] Watch out! [Marco] And get up! get up! [Serena] Go, go! And out two! Stop! Three out! Game over. [Leo] Okay, you were good, but now? Now I know we have a little problem. Level two. I'm ready. - [Marco] Right! - [Tato] Slow down! I am afraid! Good thing you said it first, I'm scared too. Then I too am afraid. [Marco] A tractor! - [Serena] Watch out! - [Marco] Oh, God! [Marco] Tractor and straw, 200 points. [yell out] There is the ravine, there is the ravine! - Help! I don't want to die! - [indistinct screams] [approaching police sirens] Come out! - Don't hurt us. - We don't want to die. I'm in a moment confusion, do not shoot. We didn't kidnap them... - The children. The children… We are the children. - Hurray! We are! - We are! - [together] We did it! - [shouts with joy] [together] Cheers! How are you? You look fine? - Never been better. - Where are the kidnappers? - Who? - The criminals who took you. Ah, those. Good question, good. - [Marco] Erm… - How are you dressed? They put these in, I don't know. - Do you know where they are now? - They escaped. Escaped. - In which direction? - Over there. No, beyond that. Optimal! All right. Let's patrol the area! They're on foot, they can't escape us. [Lo Cascio] Let's go. - [Commissioner] Are they armed? - No, but one is gay. Optimal. In so many years of service, I have not never met such stupid offenders. Beautiful, how dare you? - They're wonderful people. - Very intelligent. Guys, she's not talking about us, but of the kidnappers. Ah! Thanks for saving us from the kidnappers, that it's not us, it's them. I bet a PS5 you will never find them. Let's do one each. Let it bet. You have already lost. We'll see. [doorbell] - [Tato] Mom! - Love! My love. Mom, a curiosity, do you have anything against gays? I? No love, why? Nothing like that. We'll talk about it when I grow up. All right. [Serena] Dad! Come on, baby. HI! Love, I swear I won't force you to do anything anymore. But I wanted to tell you something. Tell me. All that you want. Can you help me become a champion? Sure my love. - Leo! - Treasure. Grandpa love! I see you and I see you again. These are no longer needed. Street! Sorry darling, but we did not know that Ronaldo, our caregiver, was part of the gang that kidnapped you. - Hand! He didn't kidnap me. - No? But what was he like? It was as we would like that you become when you grow up. [grandmother] Yes, a special person. Then, I will be even more special. I even learned to iron! Silvietta! Look who's back. Marco! The hoverboard! I want to play it too. No, it's mine and I play with it. And I tell mom and dad that you have grown up secretly. - Is this blackmail? - Yes. [cries for joy] [inaudible voices] [all] Marco, Leo, Tato and Serena! I don't understand, were your tenants the kidnappers or not? Nobody knows. The fact is that Marco has disappeared. Thor too. What then, in fact, it's a bit of a fake name. Already. I'm sorry though, because it was so… I don't get the adjective, He looked like a child. I have never met such a man. Me neighter. Play outside though. [all] Thanks! [thought of Marco] Francesca, sometimes things happen that you can't understand them, but you have to believe it and that's it. Make an effort, close your eyes and say: I believe it. If you're eight it's easy, for you who are great instead must be very difficult, but if you really try you will succeed. - [student] Hello, teacher. - [Francesca] Hello. Hello, teacher. - Good day! - Yes. - Hello, teacher. - HI. - Bye, teacher, see you tomorrow. - Until tomorrow! It's you? Mark, wait for me.
