Woman: Of course. Good morning, Ella. You're like Horowitz with a needle and thread. Hi, Max. You mean the piano player? Best there ever was. Fashion Week is only five weeks away and we've still got gaps in our collection. What about the trench-dress and the metallic blazer? Done and nearly done. Who did this? Um... I did. Who are you? Ella Richards. I'm a sewer. The placket wasn't working, so I split the pleat on either side of the closure. I like it. You do. Who are you wearing? I'm wearing me. You're a designer? A really good one. Yes, I can see that. That means a lot coming from you. Max: I met Ella on the job. I went to her loft and saw her work and I was knocked out. Hm. Max gave me the same stamp of approval when I was starting out. He was certainly right about you. I've never known him to be wrong. If Max says you're good, believe him. ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Meeting Annie Chew was so inspiring, all I want to do is work. That's all you ever do anyway. I really needed a boost right now. Every time I talk to my mom or my brother, I try to convince them that my designer dream is going strong, and they always pretend to believe me. Before you tumble down the rabbit hole of doubt, you want some left-over Chinese? Maybe later. Oh, how much Candice Huffine can one wall take? Well, I need all the inspiration I can get. Is your schedule free for the next few days? I'm waiting to hear about a new sewing gig, but it might be. There's a really big photo shoot coming up at work and I could use an extra set of hands in the fitting room. Claudia is pulling out all the stops and driving everybody nuts. Yeah, well, she's a perfectionist. Most legends are. If by "perfectionist" you mean treating everybody at the magazine with the same disdain as gum stuck to the sole of her Louboutin pumps. You certainly have a way with words. If only I could get someone to read them. I'm working on this piece about the elegant chaos of Fashion Week. "Celebrities line the runway as designers have heart attacks back stage when a model misses a cue." (chuckling) So, are those nimble fingers available? You'd be doing me a really big favour. Okay. I'm in. ♪ I mean, I don't know about you, but I had a great time last night, Yeah, who knew you could cook like that? That's almond milk, right? I thought you said soy. You know, hold on one second, I'm getting another call. Hey, when did you get back into town? I did, I tried calling you. You need to tell her what you want. I'm just-- Hold on one second. Uh... I'm sorry, what did you say? - She's waiting. - Who's waiting? She is. All of us are. Oh, right. Sorry. Um... Almond milk, please. Coming right up. Yeah. Yeah, no. You know what? Saturday night works for me. Unbelievable. Okay. I'm-- I'm going to call you back. Is something wrong? Oh, no. It's just that some of us have places to be, that's all. Right. Well, some of us would like to get what we ordered. Whatever. Wow. What? I've just never heard three syllables sound so judgmental. Well-- That's for you. Have a wonderful day. Have a wonderful day. Okay, well, call me tomorrow. Sounds good. Bye. I'm sorry. Are you-- Are you following me? I was about to ask you the same thing. So, that's a no? Don't flatter yourself. So, are you always this friendly? Only with strangers I can't seem to shake. I'm not a stranger. You're the guy who doesn't like soy milk. Seriously? I guess so. Let me guess. You're heading to the tenth floor. Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am. You work at the magazine? I just started. How about you? My roommate does. I'm just helping out for a few days. (dinging) I guess this is us. There is no us. (dinging) Do you think this was fate? Whatever it was, I'm afraid it's over, I'm late. Well, it was fun while it lasted. You said that you were new here? I am. First day. I'm a little nervous. Word to the wise, stay out of Claudia Davenport's way, I hear she can be a real tyrant. - Noted. - Good luck. Thank you. Claudia booked Umberto DeLuca to do the shoot and she's gone from overbearing to full-on diva. When I think of the fashion icons that have walked these halls. Right? Speaking of icons, keep your eyes forward and your mouth shut. Ella: Oh, wow. Look at that suit she is wearing. The woman does not disappoint. There's Liza, my impossible boss. You never said how pretty she is. If you can get past her personality. Why aren't you in The Closet? I was headed there now. Start pulling some of the looks that we discussed. ♪ I feel like Dorothy entering Oz. Start clicking your heels because here we go. Gucci. I mean. It's like I died and went to designer heaven. On your 87th visit the magic wears a little thin. Armani? It's gorgeous. - Can I try it on? - No. - Come on. Please? - No. ♪ How you doing? Our subs are down. We're losing advertisers. Hey, I get I. These are hard times for all print media. As the newly-installed man in charge, what do you propose we do? Well, I hate to say it, Claudia, but the magazine, it's-- it's outdated. The remaining subscribers, they don't relate to the content. I'm not saying it's your fault. It's just the way it is. Your father is here. Perfect, send him in. You needed back-up in dealing with your difficult Editor-in-Chief? (scoffing) I thought you go back a long way. It might be reassuring. Right. Always a pleasure, Roger. The pleasure is mine. Father. Let me try to calm the predictable tension between you. As Editor of The Look, Claudia is one of our most valuable assets. She's naturally very protective of the content. As the publisher, Derek's job is to make sure the magazine's profitable. He bailed out two of our other publications by amping up their digital presence. Does that mean you'll leave the print magazine alone? Initially, yes, but the research and results from the digital magazine will be applied to the print as we move forward. I see. I leave it to you and Derek to work out your differences, but you need to know, he speaks for me. And I will continue to speak for me and the magazine that I helped to build. Good day, fellas. - Claudia. - Liza! This is harder than it looks. Heaven forbid a Prada belt ends up in the same shot as an Armani pantsuit. I want your problems. When I started as a temp, I was so excited to have a job in the fashion industry. I just didn't think I would still be in the same closet two years later. It's a pretty nice closet. Not for the fashion editor I've always wanted to be. All these gorgeous dresses and none of them would fit a girl my size. Hey, Claudia cannot count past four. Seriously, let's go check out the shoes, they come in all sizes. Yes! (gasping) (vocalizing) Oh, wow! Can I touch? - No. - With my eyes? Sure! I wanted you to see The Closet and get an idea of how the magazine and the fashion world intersect. I work very closely with all the designers. Careers have been made because of the looks put together in this room. Yes, very impressive. Things get really crazy around here as we gear up for Fashion Week. Who is that guy talking to Claudia? (gasping) That's Derek Colby. Colby Publishing. Roger Colby's son, they own a ton of magazines, including this one. The Look is losing money so they sent the Prince of Publishing to help revive it. That's what they call him. Who calls him that? People, the press, he's a hot topic. A dating site took a poll. He was voted the 7th most eligible bachelor in New York. Liza: Katie, where are you? Great, I'll need you to take everything that you pulled to the fitting room. Claudia will want to see it on the models. And I need to call Umberto's agent right now. So, we'll see you in the fitting room and we will show you how we prepare for an editorial shoot. (phone buzzing) Can't wait. We are so happy to have you here. Yup. (phone buzzing) Uh... It's you. Are you hiding? You're hiding. No. Uh, hey. We met at a coffee shop this morning. Yes, we have all this history and I don't even know your name. Ella Richards, and I'm Katie, by the way. Oh, it's, uh, very nice to meet you. Why didn't you say who you were? And what was that about being new and nervous? Well, I am new and I am nervous. I have to make this company solvent. You see, most people are intimidated by my name and, well, I was enjoying your honesty. Why would I be intimidated? I don't work here, and I am just helping. (clearing throat) I'm sorry. I have to-- I have to go. I think I can handle it. Right. Okay, he may not be your boss, but he is mine, and my boss's boss and her boss, try to resist the urge to offend him. Okay, sure, he's just so entitled. And so attractive. I hadn't noticed. Well, he seems to have noticed you. Yeah. Well, the 7th most eligible bachelor in New York is not my kind of guy. (laughing) ♪ Lovin' somebody ♪ ♪ Having somebody ♪ Claudia will want to see the cargo pants both with and without the Hermes belt. How's it going? This dress doesn't need to be shorter, it needs to taper at the knee. It's going to look boxy. And you are? This is Ella. She's helping with the photo shoot. Less opinion, more sewing. We're on a deadline. Umberto's shoots can be so intense, he's very unpredictable. Derek, hi. (clearing throat) Would you give me a minute? Well, you got better knees than I do. I busted mine playing basketball in college. Prepping for a shoot is always daunting. So many decisions to make. Do you think the side ruching is distorting the bodice? Um... Yeah, um-- There may be too many folds in the ruching, the way it gathers at the waist. What she said. Is this your interpreter? Yes. Yes, for the moment she is. Liza: Umberto says he wants approval on all the models. Yes. This is a fashion magazine. The details are life and death. Thank you, Claudia. How can you be in charge of this place if you don't know what ruching is? Well, I just assumed it was the crumpled up fabric on the side there. It's how you crumple it that matters. Oh, wow. Okay. I admit I have a lot to learn. You think? I do. And I don't have a lot of time to learn it. ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Oh, there you are. (phone buzzing) How was your first day at school? I need a crash course in fashion. There is no such thing. Well, you're a seamstress. I'm sure you could teach me a few of the basics. I'm not just handy with a needle and thread. I'm also a designer. That's great. Gives you more credibility. With who? With me. (elevator dinging) What's happening is Claudia is using my lack of knowledge about fashion to undermine my authority. I'm sorry, but I resent your authority as much as she does. Are you following me? I was about to ask you the same thing. Are you working at the magazine tomorrow? I'll be there until the photo shoot's over, and then I'm gone. Great. Have coffee with me in the morning. I want to learn fashion from someone who loves it. How do you know I love it? Because you hate the fact that I don't. Come on. One cup. Say yes. Okay. - No, I said, "Say yes." - Yes! Perfect. This is not how I saw us ending up. So you admit there's an us. Whatever. I've never heard three syllables sound so encouraging. Ella: Thanks again for coming to my loft. My homemade boutique. So, what's the occasion again? Bobby's parents are having the engagement party at their house. Oh. I'm meeting his whole family. Well, you have picked the perfect dress. I love this colour on you. I never really thought of myself as the lavender type, just black, understated, trying to disappear. What do you think? I don't know how to thank you. Well, when you feel beautiful, you look beautiful. Yes? - Yes. - Yes. I'm revamping the digital magazine and I want to go live during Fashion Week. So, I don't have much time to get up to speed. Well, this is my first time teaching Fashion 101. Thank you. So, I'll begin with what I know best. Okay. I always have a sketchbook with me, my sewing gigs, everywhere. You never know when inspiration will strike. Just to be clear, I'm not looking for an opinion on my work, this is strictly a learning tool. Okay. No opinions. Okay. I have a philosophy about design. I call it the IFFF Factor. That's spelled with one I followed by three F's. It stands for Inspiration, Fabric, Fit, and Financials. I-F-F-F. Got it. (laughing) Okay. Inspiration can come from anywhere. A movie, a book, a colour you can't get out of your head. This dress is all about fabric. I went nuts for this brocade. Fit is about understanding the contours of a woman's body and helping her to embrace them. I know I'm not supposed to do this, but these, these are really good. Well, you don't know enough to know they're good, but, um, thank you. Financials is making sure the woman can afford it. I don't want the price tag to overwhelm the joy they get from wearing the dress. That, that might be the most important thing you said. See, I'm trying to make the publications more accessible, but my father is resistant to change, and his father founded the company, and he's the exact same way. So, the Prince of Publishing hashtag is for real. Inheriting a publishing dynasty is not such a terrible fate. You're very hard to read. What are you thinking? That our backgrounds are nothing alike. I grew up in Pittsburgh. My dad worked in a textile mill. (laughing) He'd bring home all these end-pieces and I would sew them together. He must be so proud that you became a designer. He passed away when I was a kid. Ah, I'm sorry. That's okay, my mom is proud enough for two. (phone pinging) Ooh. I'm late for Oscar. - Who's Oscar? - The man I can't live without. Ella: So, this is where the magic happens. It is. Whenever I parachute in to save one of our publications, I always take Oscar with me to run the digital side. Nice to meet you. Ella here is going to make me fashion-savvy. Savvy might be overreaching. Yeah. (chuckling) Look. What we're doing here can't be an online replica of the print version. We want to produce new, fresh, more relevant content. That might get us more traffic ad-buys, which are running really low. Right. Most women can barely afford the magazine, let alone the clothes they see inside. That's kind of my thing, bringing fashion to the masses. Yeah, I'm getting that. Fashion has been ignoring the women who aren't models, and there are a lot more of us than there are size twos. You have a chance to change that, and double your readership while you're at it. Well, I think you got a point. Let me think about it. Hello again. Hey, Oscar. Katie gave me a tour of The Closet and all the hottest designers. Lucky you. We are setting up for the photo shoot and the stylist needs to make some alterations. Mm-hm. Okay. Umberto is the best photographer in the business and an editorial shoot is a great way to learn about fashion. You should be there. Well, okay. Oscar: I can't tell if she's the boss or the assistant. Yeah, me either. ♪ ♪ Sometimes ♪ ♪ It's like we're spinning out of control ♪ ♪ Give me more eyes. That's it. I love this shot. Yes! Can we get more light on Jasmine please? A puff sleeve is hard to pull off, but I think it's perfection. Who is that person? Some sewer who latched onto Derek. Umberto thinks I'm a little shiny. You need to sign off on Manolo's Long Live Stilettos spread. Alright. Keep an eye on Derek while I'm gone. I don't want him having opinions and ruining the shoot. Derek. We met at a party in the Hamptons last summer. Do you remember? Yes, I do. You're hard to forget. It's nice to see you again. Yeah, you too. (clearing throat) Mr. DeLuca-- That's my father, I'm Bert. May I just say that picture you took of the kid looking up at the high-fashion glamazon in the Bronx is just, it's one of my all-time favourites. May I say, you have good taste, it's one of my favourites too. Excuse me, Ella, is it? Umberto is very busy. What do you do, Ella? Well, today I'm a sewer, but I'm also a designer. And that outfit you're wearing? Is one of my own. An Ella original. And now if we could resume the shoot. Until we meet again. Ella: Thank you. It looks like you just made a friend. Yeah, well, he's as nice as he is talented. Did I miss anything? What do you think of the necklace, Ella? Obviously, I missed a lot. Um, I think the necklace is overkill. It competes with the neckline. I agree. Wait a minute. The jeweler bought a four-page spread in this issue. This page is not for sale. ♪ Much better. That honesty thing you got going on? I like it. Derek has some nobody sewer calling the shots? Is he really that clueless or is he testing me? Either way, he's going to regret it. ♪ Ella, do you have a minute? What's up? Can we go to my office? There's something I'd like to discuss. This season's emphasis on asymmetrical hemlines? No, but we can go over that too. I'm still moving in. Still trying to get used to the office and all the responsibilities that go with it. What did you want to talk about? You and me. Maybe we should stick with hemlines. Well, we can talk hemlines, necklines, and anything else you think I need to know, that's kind of the point. (knocking) I hope I'm not intruding. Actually-- The art director asked if you want to see the proofs from the photo shoot since it's going to be the cover. Can you tell him that I am in a meeting, and will be with him in a moment. Meeting is executive-speak for otherwise engaged. And what are we engaged in exactly? A negotiation. I want to hire you to be my consultant, to keep me from making any fashion faux pas. You have a whole staff to do that. Yeah, well, most of the employees are loyal to Claudia and they see me as an intruder. I want an outsider. Someone who isn't afraid to speak her mind. I don't want you to hire me, or you'd be my boss. Okay, what do you want? I want a piece about me in the digital magazine, as an up-and-coming designer. So, it would be quid pro quo. I'd rather have your respect than a pay cheque Great, then we have a deal. Just like that? Just like that. My magazine, my call. I think this meeting went pretty well. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I want to include a signature design in the article about me that really represents my brand. Very Ella original. All I have to do in return is teach Derek about fashion. I'm already planning his curriculum. Okay, what is the Prince of Publishing like, up close and personal? Bored with being a prince, that's my guess. I think that's what he sees in me, I don't scrape and bow whenever he walks into a room. What do you do? I just tell him the truth. And what do you tell yourself? To keep my eye on the prize, get my name in the magazine, and not get distracted by some unattainable guy with a million-dollar smile. You tell yourself all that? Yes, and I mean every word. Okay. I'm good with being myself and being curvy, and it took me a long time to say that, I just... ...have to keep saying it. Anybody who doesn't see how great you are, that's their bad. (sighing) I so like Derek, as a person, I mean. I just can't figure out what makes him tick. So, bring it in. Okay, so, dribbling is like a dance you do with the ball. Okay? In perfect rhythm, perfect sync. Who wants to give it a try? What about you? That's it! Nice footwork. I love that. Eddie, why don't you give it a try? Good. Oh! Nice try. One more, okay? You got it. Hey, come here. It's not just about height, okay? It's about heart, and you got plenty of both. So, why don't you give it another try? Never give up. - Derek. - Oh. Hey, Harry. - How you doing? - Good, man. The team's looking good this year. Yeah, they're a great group. Listen, I was thinking we should start an arts program for the kids. Not just painting, but music, too. They got a lot to say, and it's not always easy to say it with words. That would be great. Yeah, I'm crazy busy with work right now, but as soon as I come up for air, let's get started okay? Alright, guys. We're going to do a horseshoe formation, alright? The graphics, they need more definition. If we get any eyeballs, this is not going to keep them. Understood. And what about the logos? Mm, one on the left. There you are. Uh, here I am. I wondered if you wanted to have lunch. You know what? I'm already booked. Sorry. Hello, Ella. Hi. Are you ready to go? - I am. - Where are you guys going? On a field trip. Where? The Garment District. Why? For some Fashion 101. ♪ Clothing is a form of self-expression. Every morning when you get dressed, it's like a painter with a canvas. And those canvasses come in all shapes and sizes. I'm sensing a theme here. Yeah, well, body positivity is something I really believe in. If you feel beautiful, you look beautiful. Okay, now for some fashion basics. I promise I will leave my soapbox at the door. ...better here. You gotta watch the sequins. Okay and watch that shoulder... ♪ This is where the rubber meets the runway before Fashion Week. There are a lot of looks in a collection and they all have to be stand-outs. Hello, hello! Ella: Thank you for letting us look around. - You bet. - This is Max Rintels. Derek. He is the heart and soul of the Garment District. The rag-trade is in my genes. My father was a pusher. A... a pusher? That's what they call the guys who push racks of clothes from jobber to jobber on 7th Avenue. And my mom worked in a sweatshop. I know a little bit about going into the family business. Oh, yeah? What line of work are you in? Publishing. He works at The Look magazine. Oh, yeah, what do you do there? I, um... His family owns it. (laughing) Right. Nice work, if you can get it. I'm giving him a crash course on fashion. Ah, well, if you're okay with Ella, you're okay with me. Fabric is the first F in IFFF. It doesn't just dictate how a design will look, but how it feels. We call that a fabric's hand. Okay. Silk has a very soft and sensual hand. - Okay. - Go ahead and give it a try it. (clearing throat) Yeah. I see what you mean. Okay. Let's hit the next stop on our fashion tour. Sure, uh, after you. Thank you. (bell ringing) This is a typical women's clothing store. Okay. Whether it's a high-end boutique or a chain store at the mall, the sizes go from two to 14. That salesgirl right there is straight out of "Pretty Woman." She wants to tell me I don't belong here. Well, I have got news for her. The average size of the American woman is 16. Since we're the vast majority, maybe it's time they start stocking stores with things that fit. Sorry, sometimes the soapbox sneaks up on me. You're cute when you get mad. Don't patronize me. I'm not. How about this? You're ferocious when you get mad. That's better. I have a question. Do women dress for themselves or do they dress for others? It depends which woman we're talking about. Let's talk about you. I'm just looking in the mirror and trying to be the me I want to be. Wow, I'm not sure if there's a right answer, but, if there is, I'm pretty sure that was it. Yeah, well, it wasn't always the case. Mirrors used to be the enemy, and now they're just a piece of glass. - What I see is up to me. - Hm. So what are we doing next? - People watching. - Hm. She is on her lunch break and she has to get back to work. The suit is a knock-off, but, you know, she's ambitious, and one day it will be the real thing. Does she read The Look? She springs for the September issue once a year. And what do you see when you look at me? Designer from head-to-toe. Money is obviously not an issue. I see the 7th most eligible bachelor in New York. Yeah, well, don't believe everything you hear. (chuckling) It's, uh-- It's not who I am. Okay. So, is today about teaching me fashion or making The Look more inclusive? It's both. See that girl and her mother? That was me and my mom when I was a kid. She used to take me from store to store, and one day I asked her why. And she said that they didn't have what we wanted in my favourite colour. And what's your favourite colour? Blue, but then I got older, and I realized that she didn't take me from store to store because they didn't have it in my colour, they just... ...didn't have it in my size. You're very persuasive. And what are you? Convinced. Okay. Wow, great! You know, maybe you should try being a little more enthusiastic. Oh. (laughing) I think it would look good on you. I got a meeting with some advertisers, but I'm looking forward to our next lesson. Me, too. Woman: Hey, slow down! - Hi. - Hi. Are we celebrating something? Uh, no. That could have been ugly. Oh. Right. Um... Thank you. You're... You're welcome. Do you always get that dressed up to sew? Only when I'm a fan of my employer. I used to work as a sewer to pay my bills. Most designers can't sew. They have the vision, but not the talent. You two have a lot in common, and by that I mean actual talent. Show Annie your sketchbook. Max, you're embarrassing me. Embarrassed looks good on you, show her the sketchbook. I'd really like to see it. Okay. Uh... You're even better than Max said. Told you. Mm. These are nice. It may be time to give up your day job. Thank you. I need you to make me a promise. When you hit it big, you stay exactly who you are. Yeah. ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Okay, don't get too excited about this, but I asked Max if you could talk to Annie about buying an ad. That was very nice of you. Well, I got a stake in this thing succeeding. There you are! I had an idea I couldn't wait to share. We should have a party that coincides with Fashion Week. A big splashy event to celebrate the relaunch of the digital magazine with you at the helm. Well, the party would get us some press and that might generate some buzz. I ran it past Claudia and got her okay. I told her it was a way to publicly divvy up your two domains. If you have your own domain, you can make all the changes you want. What kind of changes? I plan to make the magazine more inclusive and broaden our reach. The Look is very inclusive. We use models of every race and ethnicity. But not every size. That's a pretty big change. And it's long overdue. I want to give this new direction a shot. I'm really impressed by your willingness to take a risk. I want to throw you a party as big and as bold as your vision. A party would be great. Thanks, Liza. ♪ Oscar: So this is how the other half lives. You've never been here before? No, I would remember. Do you play? Yeah, well, with all that piano, I better. So, the 9th is when Fashion Week starts. That gives us approximately three and a half weeks to pull this whole thing off. No pressure. Yeah. No pressure. Cheers. Friends of yours? Yeah. You could say that. I've never seen you smile so wide. Where was this taken? I opened a Youth Center in Brooklyn. You never told me that before. I know. I, uh-- I don't tell many people that. So, this is your way of giving back. I get a lot more than I give. Those kids keep me grounded. Says the man in the luxury penthouse apartment. Come on. I'm moving, by the way. I'm looking for a townhouse that I can restore. Something closer to the Center. Closer to who you want to be? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. (dinging) You got this. Okay, I'm going to give her the three pieces about Fashion Week to read. I love them all. Liza, do you have a moment? Derek: Oh, Ella! Annie Chew just gave us an ad-buy! I mentioned body inclusivity in our pitch and she said that's something she'd like to support. That is so great on so many levels. I heard there was an opening for an assistant fashion editor, and I was hoping you could get Claudia to read some samples of my work. Claudia is incredibly busy, and so am I. This party is taking up all my time. I'm a little surprised you'd ask for a favour right now. Timing is everything, Katie. ♪ Hats are the best thing ever. Most women are the same size above the ears, and there are no stigmas whatsoever. What happened with Liza? She shut me down. What? Let me see what I can do. Like what? I don't know. Where are you going? To talk to Derek. You might want to lose the hat. - Yes. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. I think Katie should write the article about me. Okay, uh... Look, I know you two are friends, but... She's a really good writer who wants to be a fashion editor. No one knows me better than she does. Oscar? It would make the piece more personal which might be good. (sighing) Okay. Excellent. Great. I should go, I have a meeting with my father. - Good luck. - Yeah. He needs luck meeting with his dad? Roger Colby is about as flexible as Mount Rushmore and Derek is trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm mixing my metaphors, but you get my point. Well, I don't care what the board members say. It's not just about the numbers, it's about making a difference. As the heir apparent to a publishing institution, you sometimes sound quite naïve. Hm. Well-- (clearing throat) Ella! This is my father, Roger Colby. This is Ella Richards. It's nice to meet you. You too. Temper your idealism with the monetary realities. Temper your generational blinders with the real world. I told Katie that she was writing the article and she was thrilled. You did a good thing. As far as Colby's go, you're pretty cool. Most people like me because of my last name. You seem to like me in spite of it. Who says I like you? Do you want to go to dinner tonight? Dinner in what context? We order, we eat, we talk hemlines. So this is a work thing? It's a friend thing. Yeah. Mm-hm. - Great. - Okay. (exhaling) Ella: This is really nice. Well, it's a thank you for Annie Chew. I hope other designers follow her lead. See I have to prove to my father that the digital future is an opportunity to reach more people. Maybe it's a good thing you didn't become - a basketball player. - Yeah. After college I rebelled. I got as far from my family heritage as I knew how. And how did you do that? I travelled. Went to Spain. Fell in love with Spain. Have you ever been to Spain? I can barely afford a ticket to Pittsburgh. You know, as soon as Ella Originals takes off, Spain is the first place I'll go. I didn't mean for that to sound arrogant. I was just trying to ask you a question. And I was answering a question. Okay, are we fighting or flirting, I can't tell. Me neither. Okay, so, after sunny Spain, how did you get to where you are now? Well, I realized I could do things my own way. So, I got my MBA, I learned the world of publishing, and to respect the reader as much as the bottom line. Sounds like you have a soapbox of your own. I think I'm just trying to impress you. It's working. Is it the Bordeaux or the company? I'm gonna go with the wine. (both laughing) But, you know, the company is hard to resist. ♪ Where were you? I went to dinner with Derek. You went on a date? Not a date, just talking and hanging out. Where did you go? Le Petit Jardin. It was a date. Whatever it was, I had a wonderful time. He probably dates a lot of women, models and socialites, I'm just a novelty. And this article is way too important, it could change my career. I'm not going to ruin that with some flirtation. Are you buying any of that? Because I'm not. Okay, I really like him, and a lot more than I bargained for. You don't want to get hurt. Exactly. (camera snapping) All this stuff is great. Who is that? Oh, that's Candice Huffine. The most amazing full-figured model in the world. And also my muse. This is really pretty. Thank you. I can make it in a smaller size if you'd like. Are they for sale? Yeah, for sure. Right here in my little boutique. Annie Chew used to sell her designs out of a loft. It's like a rite of passage. Musicians start in a garage, and designers start in a loft. And where do you go from here? Maybe, someday, I'll have my own showroom on Fashion Avenue, or I'll just keep freelancing as a seamstress. Come on. You need to have more faith in yourself. I'm still that kid from Pittsburgh. I arrived in New York and called myself a designer. And, you know, it can be really scary when you dream that big. Dream as big as you want, you got the talent to back it up. This place is terrific. It's really gonna add to the story. 100 years ago this building was filled with sweatshops. All the immigrant garment workers were from the Lower East Side. It's hallowed ground. Let's-- Let's make sure we include that, huh? You got it. You know, I thought I was doing you a favour with this article. Turns out you're doing me one. You're going to be a fantastic read. Is that publisher-speak or do you really mean it? Every word. So, how's it-- How's it coming along? I think this piece on Ella could be really special. Well, I think Ella is really special. Stop me if I'm crossing a line here, but are you two a thing? Not the type of thing I'm used to. Hm. I'm not sure what to call us. I'm getting the sense she has some reservations. So, show her who you really are. The stuff that you're into. What if she's disappointed by the man I turn out to be? At least you'll know it's not your money and good looks that are the problem. Stop it. So, what's the surprise? Where are you taking us? You'll see. We're almost there. - Almost where? - I don't know! Tell me. Alright. I'm taking you to a gym. You're taking me to a gym in Brooklyn? Mm-hm. Surprise! Big surprise. I may be over-dressed. No, you are perfect. It's right here. It's like reaching for a cookie on top of a shelf. Okay, up and curve. Just like this. Alright? Alright. So, just like that I want you to try a few shots. Ah, nice try. Okay, so, I think what the problem is, is-- Hey. Hi. Bend your knees a little. It's kind of a spectator thing-- I'm on Eddie's team. Alright. Hi. Alright, so, I used to play basketball with my brother, and he was a point guard in high school, alright? So, why don't you try to loosen your grip before you release and give it more arc. Yeah? Relax and follow-through on your release. - Go, Eddie! - Oh! Good work. Thanks. Go, Ella. See? You can do it. Eddie: Yeah, I can. That's a happy man. Must be the company he's keeping. This is how you play. I take a shot, if I get it in, you have to duplicate, if you miss, you get an H. And when you miss you get another letter. I have been playing Horse with my brother since I was six-years old. You, sir, are going down. Oh. It is on. Okay. Does this hurt? No, I think I just twisted it. Does this hurt? Ow! Oh, gosh. Yeah, why would you do that? (chuckling) Stupid. I think it's my pride that's hurt. Here you go. Thank you, Harry. Thank you very much. You know, you're not who I thought you were. Yeah? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It's good. Word of advice, though. Next time, wear high-tops. (chuckling) Thanks for the fashion tip. It's not a fashion tip. It's common sense. How's your ankle? Much better. Thank you. It might be sore for a while. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. (both chuckling) Were you close to your family growing up? Colby's doesn't do close. We do what's expected. See, my father grew up in the very long shadow of my grandfather, and I am expected to do the same. But he's still your father. Yeah. (chuckling) My father was everything to me. I miss him every day. You should find a way to make some good memories while you still can. Yeah. I have a lot of opinions. I've noticed, yeah. Walk me home at your own risk. This is me. I should get inside, I have a sewing gig in the morning. You need to commit to being a designer. And it's not just about the way other people see you, it's how you see yourself. Yeah, well, I'm not ready to make that leap. Maybe after the article comes out I'll have more confidence, or maybe people won't like my designs and I'll just be sewing seams forever. (scoffing) Welcome to the inside of my head. It's my favourite place to be. You're in there a lot. Am I? I'm sorry. I-- No, just, um... This is happening really fast. Yup. - I mean, it feels that way. - No, it didn't mean-- It's-- I mean-- I just-- I need time to get my bearings. Sure, yeah. As much as you need. It might help if you were a little less wonderful. I'll work on that. Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (door opening, closing) ♪ What are you up to? This dress is to wear to the party. I want it to be perfect, magical. Max gave me the remnants of this gorgeous silk. Oh, I love the colour. I know. It's called Fairytale Blue. The Prince is gonna love it. This is not about him. This is about me holding my own at that party. I'm going to be surrounded by the most important people in fashion, people I want to impress. I get to be one of the designers. Well, you're gonna knock it out of the park, the ballroom or wherever. Get some glass slippers to go with the dress. Mm! Yeah! Yes. I want to coordinate the photos of the loft and the Lower East Side neighbourhood with your article. What pictures, what article? I'm writing a piece about Ella for the digital magazine. On whose authority? On Derek's authority, and on mine. And what is it about Ella that the readers are dying to know? That she is designing beautiful clothes the fit the full-figured women that The Look has been ignoring for 50 years. Well said. I doubt very much that Claudia would agree. ♪ Jasmine would be an absolute vision in that outfit if she were wearing the necklace I selected. If I could have a quick word? It's important. Nothing is more important than The Book. It's about the future of the magazine and the direction it's taking. Unfurrow your brow and cut to the chase. I'm talking about Derek's plans for the digital magazine. It's a big departure from the usual content, and by "big" I mean wider. And by "wider" I mean full-figured. He's doing a story about Ella. That nobody from the fashion shoot? I don't know what she's telling him, but Derek seems to be listening. Well, then his father better start listening to me. My name is synonymous with this brand and I will not be ignored. ♪ Great. Claudia called my father to complain, and now we have a meeting to discuss the questionable decision to give plus-size so much space. And how much space does she think the majority of American women deserve? We could hold the editorial on body positivity for a few months. Body positivity isn't just some trendy phrase. It's changing lives. Knowing that you're valued for who you are, any size, any shape. Don't let anyone take that away. ♪ In order to increase revenue, we have to appeal to a broader base. Well, they're certainly broader, I'll grant you that. Oh, come on. But not the type to buy The Look. Perhaps if The Look weren't so condescendingly narrow in scope they would. Who is putting all this nonsense in your head? I am vehemently opposed to some everywoman idea of fashion. It should be aspirational. Beautiful women we all want to be, wearing beautiful clothing! And isn't that how every woman wants to feel? I mean, I'm not setting limitations on who's allowed to dream when they read our magazine. I'm sorry, Claudia, but I'm not changing my mind. Does he still speak for you? Assuming he turns out to be right. Well, we stick with what we got. (chuckling) On behalf of a whole lot of women, thank you. (clearing throat) Father, you remember Ella. Hello, again. This is how you make critical business decisions? On the advice of a momentary fling? It isn't momentary and it's not a fling. We're working together. Very closely, it appears. Filling my shoes isn't automatic, it has to be earned. Well, if this is going to work, I have be able to do things my own way. Not if it means risking the company that defines our family name. ♪ Mr. Colby? I may be overstepping, but I think your son is trying to do some good with the opportunity you gave him. He has some pretty great ideas of what the future could look like. Give him the chance to make you proud. Are you always this bold? Only when I know I'm right. He needs you to believe in him. (elevator dinging) Point well-taken. And well-delivered. ♪ Not too shabby, as penthouses go. But he's moving to Brooklyn, so he's forgiven. Yes, I am making my daring escape from the Upper East Side. It's about time. So, the secret to a good Bolognese sauce is the pancetta. The more pancetta the merrier, I always say. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. - You always say that? - Yup. Who do you say it to? Mostly to myself, it doesn't really come up a lot. (laughing) So, I gather you like to cook. Yeah, you know, it's kind of a hobby of mine. Pretty sure you learned that at your last publication. Okay, Oscar, that's enough out of you. Now, for the real test. Okay. What do you think? More wine? I think you should leave sensational alone. Hm. I like working here, better food, better view. Away from Claudia and her spies. Yeah, well, we go live in nine days, so Claudia's views will be a moot point. I'm sure she'll find a way to un-moot her point. So, you play that piano? Yeah, yeah. A little bit. I'm gonna head home. I will see you two tomorrow. Alright, have a good night. You too. Alright, Colby. Let's see what you got. Alright, but I'm not looking for an opinion. (chuckling) Any requests? Your piano, your call. Okay. ♪ Is there anything you can't do? I can't sew. Good. I can't skate. Yeah, that makes the two of us. I can't walk in heels. (chuckling) I thought we agreed you'd be less wonderful. (chuckling) Sorry. ♪ It's only a dress. No lives are at stake. Do you know how many silkworms on how many mulberry leaves it took to make this fabric? Ugh, TMI. I prefer to think that silk just happens, no creepy crawly critters are involved. Liza is coming in late today. She is so obsessed with this party. I bet she's having something done before the big event. Like what? (speaking in a British accent) The red-carpet special, Ella. What's that? Have you seen Katie? No. She's somewhere around here. What are you looking at? What do you mean? I have a staff meeting. I had a lunch-time touch-up. Are you judging me? I'm not judging, I'm nodding. It's not easy being surrounded by all these models. Always feeling like the before instead of the after. A little filler helps. I get it. No, you don't. Trust me, I do. ♪ Katie: The article is almost done, but it's hard to capture Ella in 500 words. Well, how about smart, funny, talented, to name a few. I couldn't agree more. You've gotta keep the immigrant garment workers who lived in the building, it gives the story gravitas. Gravitas coming right up. You want to get a bite to eat? I have to get back to The Closet. Liza wants me to pull some dresses for her to wear to the party. And what are you going to wear? Where? To the party. You could be my plus one. Oh, I guess I'm going to a party. (both laughing) Just bring some advertisers with you, please. It's not that bad. Oh, it is. People still see us as a sidecar to the print magazine. We need this party to generate some major buzz before we publish, okay? Is Claudia on her broomstick again? No, it's currently parked. Just the usual woes of trying to turn a profit. Wanna go get lunch? I'm buying. Oh, I would love to, it's just I have a meeting with an ad agency. Oh, well, in that case, go get 'em. Another time? Any other time? You're on. Okay. Sometimes I feel like he's too good to be true. What's a girl supposed to do when subjected to all that charm? I think he's into you, and you're obviously into him. I was hoping it wasn't that obvious. You've had serious boyfriends before, why is this throwing you for such a loop? Peter was great on paper, but he never made me laugh. and Jason and I almost got married, but, you know, deep down, I knew he wasn't the one. I don't know, they were both reasonable choices, the 7th most eligible bachelor in New York, not so much. Try not to run away before you find out. I hate that you know me so well. I have to go to bed, I have such an early morning tomorrow. Almost finished. What do you think? It is even more magical than the sketch. It's very Cinderella. I used to love Cinderella when I was a kid. I read all the storybooks, saw all the movies, but Cinderella never looked like me. There are a lot of little girls feeling what I felt. I kind of want to change that. Yet another pearl of wisdom that I have to now jam into this article. (chuckling) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Alright, what do you got? No. No. Doesn't work. ♪ Another RSVP. I am not happy about this party. Derek is trying to stand in my spotlight. The guest list needs to include all of the designers and VIPs that are loyal to me. Of course. And invite Jasmine and some of the models from the print issue, they know how to steal the focus. Liza: The list is getting pretty long. I have all the would-be advertisers that Derek is courting. Annie Chew and her team are coming, the RSVPs are pouring in. What about Ella? Well, she's been working with Derek so I just assumed. Well, make an excuse. I mean, we're overbooked and you had to make some cuts. I don't want her whispering in his ear all night long. I want you whispering in his ear. Only the things you want him to hear. Ella, do you have a minute? Sure. This is a little awkward. What is it? It's about the party. I have to invite all these high-profile VIPs. Unfortunately, we had to make some cuts in the guest list. Are you telling me I'm not invited? I'm sorry, Ella, but I had no choice. The point of the party is to get press. Derek has so much riding on this. You're a sewer who's trying to make her mark, and I respect that, but he needs the place to be packed with established designers who can buy ads. I hope you understand. I understand. Ella didn't want me to say anything to Derek, so I'm saying it to you, this stinks! I have no idea what you're talking about. Liza took Ella off the guest list for the party because it was VIP only. Just how important does a person need to be to get into this thing?! Nobody's more important to this relaunch than Ella. Well, she certainly isn't feeling that way. Let me talk to Derek. Liza made it sound like she was doing this for him. Are you sure he didn't know? Not if he's who I think he is. ♪ Hey, Liza. Can I talk to you for a second? Of course, Derek. Hi. Hi. Listen, I just-- I just wanted to thank you for all your hard work that you've been doing with the party. That means so much coming from you. There's a problem, though, and I need you to fix it. Whatever you need. Put Ella's name back on the guest list. I don't know what she told you, but I didn't have a choice. Ella didn't tell me anything, okay? This is me telling you what I want. Claudia wanted all her regulars there so she wouldn't be sidelined. I like Ella, but she means nothing to Claudia, so she made me cut her. I was in a bind, Claudia is my boss. And I'm her boss, okay? So, I want you to put Ella Richard's name back on the list. Of course. Great. Thank you, Liza. No problem. (phone ringing) (beeping) Hi. Hey. Look, signals got crossed, alright, it was a mistake. Of course you're invited. Are you sure? Yes. So sure I don't even have the words. Well, that was a pretty good start. Why don't you say a little more? Okay, uh, how about it wouldn't be the same without you. That works. So I'll see you there? Yes, you will. ♪ Nice glass slippers. Yeah, well, these shoes were not made for walking, just standing around. I love your hair like that. Thank you. Just a casual do that took longer to perfect than the dress. Okay, so what do you think? I was worried these would be too girly. Girly and boring. Wow, um, don't hold back. Tell me how you really feel. I bought these at an estate sale. I was saving them for a special occasion and just the right dress. They're perfect. You got yourself one very handy Fairy Godmother. Thanks. Okay, I better get dressed, we don't want to be late. I'll go turn a pumpkin into an Uber and we will head for the ball. ♪ Good evening, everyone. What a wonderful way to kick off Fashion Week. Thank you all so much for coming. Aren't these ladies lovely? (cameras snapping) (gasping) Oh, Derek. Please. Come on. Oh, Claudia, it's not a great time. - I was just-- - Photo op! (clearing throat) Okay. Jasmine, how are you? Good. Thank you for coming. Alright, we'll make this quick. (cameras snapping) Derek! Derek! Yes, Jeremy. Hey! How ya doing? Why all the fanfare, Derek? That's a great question, Joey. The Look is getting a new look online, and I want to make sure the fashion industry knows what's coming. Hey, hey. Nice to meet you. Hope you got your check book. Everything is going digital, including fashion. Legacy magazines like The Look need to bend with the times. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me? (chuckling) Wow. You look beautiful. You clean up pretty well yourself. I'm so glad you're here. Ella, what a nice surprise. That dress is everything! Well, hearing you say that is everything. (chuckling) I'm a big fan of Ella's work. Is that right? Well, we're doing a story about Ella as an undiscovered talent. I would love it if you could give us a few quotes. All you need. (chuckling) That's-- Thank you. Oh, of course. You deserve it. Great. ♪ There you are. You look amazing. That dress is perfect. Thank you. Jasmine: Derek! Are you having a good time? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Me too. Woman: Derek, how about a picture? (clearing throat) (camera snapping) That's great. I have to do a live-cast in a few minutes. Maybe I'll see you later. Yeah. Maybe. (clearing throat) Pretty girl. It's, um-- Oscar: I've just been approached by two more designers. They heard about the plus-size push and they want in. I'm getting the same feedback. I think it's time for a dance. Oh, yeah. Um... Would you like to dance? Come on. You and that dress deserve to be seen. Well, when you put it like that. Mm-hm. (slow song playing) Hey. This is the same silk you used to teach me about fabric. You remembered. Of course I did. The softest hand I ever felt. ♪ Just like you stepped out of a dream ♪ ♪ Baby, summer sun... ♪ Look who's still whispering in Derek's ear. I thought I made myself clear. He made me put her on the list. Claudia: We need to do something about her right now, before this full-figured fiasco becomes permanent policy. Like what? (chuckling) Look at her. She is out of her league, personally and professionally. Surely she must know that. Deal with it. Both: Whoa. Everything okay? Uh, yeah. It's my shoe. What happened? The strap just broke. Let me go get a safety pin. I'll pretend this never happened. Pretend what never happened? I'll be right back. Okay. Go. Liza: Hello, Ella. That happened to me on a job interview, I barely limped my way through it. Very pretty dress. Makes you look more of a designer than a sewer. I am a designer. I'd like us to be friends, Ella. Maybe we can attack the elephant in the room. That didn't come out right. How do you do it? Do what? Live with yourself. It isn't easy. Which is why I'm trying to do the right thing now. And what's that? You're here tonight because Derek insisted you be at this party. Okay. Thank you for telling me that. But it isn't for the reason you think or hope. He wanted to score points with Annie Chew and all the designers jumping on the body positivity bandwagon. Derek is here to sell ad space. What do you think the dance was for? Taking you for a very public spin so he could show everyone what a good guy he is. Okay, Liza, you've made your point. I know you think I'm the enemy, but I'm not. Derek is using you. I wish you'd see that. ♪ You got a great turnout. Yup. Your instincts were right about taking a more inclusive stance. It isn't just an advertising strategy. The Look has been perpetuating an unhealthy standard, and it's time for a change. Hm. Perhaps you're right. (clearing throat) Um... I want to start by thanking you all for being here tonight. The relaunch of the digital magazine means a lot to me. We have an opportunity here. An opportunity to expand our readership and do some good at the same time. You see, body positivity isn't just some trendy slogan, it matters, it matters to a lot of women out there. Women you all want to reach. You see, size 16 is the most common clothing size for the American women, and I think it's time our magazine reflects that. Oh, please. Thankfully, you all agree. because we just sold all of our advertising space for the first issue of the digital magazine. (audience applauding) Yeah! (applauding) Now, the idea of inclusivity extending to fashion, it was new to me, but I had a great teacher. An up-and-coming designer and someone who cares deeply about these issues. If I might, I'd like to introduce to you Ella Richards. (applauding) Ella? We are grateful for Derek's contribution to our digital counterpart. Mm-hm. But let's not forget the print magazine, which continues to define fashion. (audience applauding) (sewing machine rattling) (phone ringing) (sewing machine rattling) Ella. Sewing helps me clear my mind... ...and my heart. I don't think it's working this time. Derek texted me. Said he's been trying to reach you. I'm not interested in being some plus-sized Cinderella to his Prince Charming. Wear something really nice today, okay? I think I'm going to stay home. Annie Chew will be there, she's doing an editorial shoot. It would be really hard to walk into that place. We publish in a few days and this article could really put you on the map. Forget about the guy with the million-dollar smile, keep your eyes on the prize. (sighing) Alight. All systems go. Ella will be here any minute. It's a lot of moving parts in this, so everything needs to move like clockwork. Hi. Uh, hi. What's going on? Uh... Right before we publish, things get a little nuts. You know, you guys go ahead, we'll go finish up. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just some last minute details I need to take care of. Maybe I should wait outside. Maybe-- Maybe you should tell me what's wrong. Ella. Talk to me. Can we just keep this about work and leave it at that? No. No, we can't. I was really upset when you left. I made this big speech and introduced you, and... The woman who inspired it all she-- she wasn't there. I felt like you were using me to make some kind of statement and sell more ads. Ella, I thought you knew me better than that. You know how you always talk about my honesty? Uh-huh. Well, maybe I haven't been honest with myself. I do know you, and I know how much I care for you. I think that's what I'm running from. Let's get real, I'm not exactly your type. What do you think my type is? You have cover girls like Jasmine-- Jasmine doesn't even-- What exactly do I mean to you?! Ella. You, Ella. You mean everything to me. Which is why I need you to come with me. Come on. Come on. Where are we going? You'll see. Father. What are you doing here? I was hoping we could have lunch. Hello, Ella, it's very nice to see you again. You too. I'm sorry, it's very busy, there's a lot going on today. It's not a good time. Oh, alright. Well, this will just take a moment, but I think it's important. I just came from a board meeting where I found myself saying that the future of the company... ...is in good hands. The hands of my very capable son. Thanks, Dad. - Derek? - Yeah? We need to get to the studio! Right, I'll, uh-- I'll be right there. Is it always this busy around here? Busy? Yes. Happy? No. That's new. Bye. (sighing) Fashion. I just wanted to say hello. Hello, Ella. Max, I didn't know you'd be here. Where else would I be on such a big day? Annie gave me some great quotes that you might want to hear. I think you're very talented, Ella, and I think you care about your customer. I do. I want to expand my company. I have been looking for a designer that can do full-figured women justice. I think that's you. I would like to be in business with you. I don't know what to say. I would go with yes. Yes, yes. The biggest, loudest yes ever! (laughing) Well, then let's get the word out about Ella Originals. Oh, Bert is doing your photo shoot. No, Ella, he is doing your shoot. Derek gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. He said he would let me shoot my favourite model. Candice Huffine. Wearing my dress. Hi, Ella. Congratulations. I'm so excited for you. Thank you. (laughing) Wow. You are a hero of mine. I mean, your confidence is as stunning as your beauty. Thank you for helping me find mine. Thank you. It is such an honour to be here. And I know that we're going to be great friends.
