Near the end of the '80s, we had the idea of mixing the rules of raid rallies like Paris-Dakar with those of American football where the objective is to stop the advance of the adversary. The winner received five million francs. The driver of the red truck must reach Terminus after a 5000 km race. He is the only one who knows the location of Terminus. He is free to choose his own route. Every time he enters a new zone, the number of gray trucks, determined at stop T, increases. To this day, no truck has reached Terminus. Hello, Doctor. Welcome to Terminus. -Mati? -Yes, I'm the doctor's Monster. -He programmed Monster. -I understood. We'll have the hologram satellite in 20 seconds. Please follow me. Spaceship decryption initiated. Five, four, three, two, one… Receiving! Oh, splendid! You see, Mati. It's exactly as I promised. Is that Monster? Yes, in the red truck with your friend, Gus. This is medium magnification. A bird's-eye view. We cover a radius of five kilometers. Close-up view. Fantastic! Can I try? Want me to tell you how it works? No. I understood. Doctor! I'll be back. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I want Monster to get a better score than last time. I'm sure he will. After all of these failures, my probability of success is good. Good thing we're not transporting nitroglycerin. Just a fake little atomic bomb that's been miniaturized. Tell me where the grays are. Still 1800 meters behind us. If you want my opinion, they're not trying to catch us, but rather trap us permanently in this city. Bizarre. It's as if there were interference. Or we were near a high-intensity magnetic field. Yes, Sir. I followed your instructions to the letter. Mati is unaware of the existence of Little Brother, our second truck. But as intelligent as he is, I'd be shocked if he didn't discover it. Don't try to bring everything back to the intelligence of your guinea pig. It's a sign of your failure more than anything else. You and I know perfectly well that that wasn't the goal we set. I know. Nevertheless, it's an interesting side effect. I gave you my consent to test Mati… and I'd prefer you not lose sight of our main objective: the Little Brother project. Of course. We'll need ten or 20 Matis to begin. And this time, make sure that they don't retain this unpleasant human side which is so uncontrollable. As for intelligence, it's nothing but a simple waste of neurons. We agree, don't we? The city is entering my radar scan. If you like, I can drive while you analyze the situation. Okay, but carefully. Understood? Risk margin: ten percent. Five percent maximum. Just to maintain our lead. Okay. Enlarge C3 for me. And I want data on the truck in A2. How much time does he need to get back on the direct route and arrive at the intersection? Forty-five seconds if the driver has good reflexes, but if he's waiting for orders, a minute. We'll take the parallel street on the right. In 100 meters through the houses. No major obstacles. We'll have about five meters between the walls. In going straight ahead, we might kill two or three chickens, but it should be fine. That's what I was going to suggest: going straight, we may kill some chickens, but it should be fine. The grays behind us are now at 300 meters. Do you want to take the wheel? Watch out! The supplies! -They'll block us at the intersection. -I saw, Monster. Watch out! They didn't see the marker at the entrance to the square. Gus isn't out of the trap yet. -Watch out! -Get down! This way! -Watch out! -No! We're going faster than the gray. But he has less distance to travel, driver. Can the other one stop at the intersection? No, he's going too fast. His objective is to get ahead of us on the main street. We're not taking the main street. We're jumping over it. Wow! Watch out! They're crazy! What is it? Remarkable. Really remarkable. But the game is far from over. Can you change the record? It's not a record. It's a song I took from the radio and stored in my memory. Yes, but you've played it five times. Only four times. And it's very nice, very moving. I don't understand Arabic. It's actually Hindi. But I can translate the words for you if you want. -It's the story of a little girl-- -No, thank you.Nein! All right. I see what it is. I am shutting up. Fine. Don't pout! Monster! Monster! What is that? -What are those images? -I don't know. I don't understand. Maybe it's the impact from when we hit the barrier. Slow down. Don't worry. Radar confirms the information. A detour. Astonishing! -Can we take it? -Too late. Monster, what is this dark bar? A trench. Hurry. We should make it at 100. "Should"? Get me the major. What's she doing? She made it. Come on, what is she doing? They thought they'd make it. That it was doable. They were right. If the truck had taken the detour, we would have easily lost an hour. Oh no! A roadblock! But it's not the grays. That isn't their type of truck. The data given by the team who did the tracking indicates a military garrison 30 kilometers south. -I'm afraid that-- -In the name of God! Don't worry, Doctor. If it's not the grays, there's no problem. You don't understand, Mati. It's worse. Oh boy. He doesn't look very friendly. I'll negotiate with them. Try. There's no other solution. It's my fault. I'm really sorry. I wonder. Come here, my little lamb. -Hit her good. -Tickle her butt. For fuck's sake. Are you French? Who are you? That's a good question. Wanna know where your truck is? They towed it to the yard. And they searched it. It's a real luxurious truck. Where did you hear that? News travels fast here. Fast. Very fast. Save your matches. They're hard to find in this hole. A kid taught me this trick. Have I been here long? You slept for two hours. Maybe three. Stop playing with those matches! What if I like it? The guards will see the light. You shouldn't let them know you're awake. Why? The sooner they come, the faster I'll get out of here. You're counting on their chivalry? No, but when they understand who I am, it won't take much time. They'll let me go immediately. I'm leaving tomorrow. Maybe. I know them. I know them too well. I've been here for five years. Tell them what they want to know. I have nothing to tell your friends! My friends? You don't get it! You're an idiot! They're gonna kill you! Please. Please. A gift from my friends. I was once like you. Most of all, I had a big mouth. This was the price. You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen. I'm sorry. It's really a bad situation in which to fall in love. With things like this, you don't choose the place or the time. I'm sorry, my dear lady. The major has arrived. He wants to see you. I will accompany you You're free. It's funny. One comes and one goes. -No! Come! -No! Come. Hello. How are you? I'm pleased to meet you. Me too, Major. -There's been a misunderstanding. -No. Your authorities asked for authorization to play your game on our territory. It was refused. We have enough problems in the region without strangers coming to have fun. You decided to come anyway? Too bad for you. You're making a mistake. A mistake? I don't think so. Incidentally, we found this box in your truck. Do you know what it is? No idea. Let's look at it together then. YOU INTERCEPTED THE ATOMIC BOMB. 1000 POINTS! Amusing. You people from rich countries really know how to entertain yourselves. You're big kids. You're making a mistake. A very big mistake. It could cost you your career. I'm a gambling man. I think your game is hiding something. And I want to know what it is. Where is the real bomb? You're crazy. Totally crazy. I wasn't given a computer when I was a kid. I wasn't able to play with little dragons or to shoot at asteroids. My parents didn't have the means. But we had more grown-up games. Let me take care of her, Major! -I'll show her! -No, I will! Quiet! First work, then pleasure. I always wanted to have an atomic bomb. So, miss, where is the bomb? David, you start. It's always the same. We break, then we repair. Do you realize? Now we have to stitch her up. In any case, if she ends up with two broken legs, she won't be dancing any time soon. -Do you know how to write? -Yes. I'm here for a very long time. Maybe forever. I think there's a cheater. A ghost truck. A yellow truck. Radar interference. They must be exposed. Stump must replace me in the race. He has to drive the truck and take it to Mati. Help him. Give the password for Monster to Stump. Write. Between the burn and the light… you must choose the light. Between the burn and the light… you must choose the light. Between the burn… BETWEEN THE BURN AND THE LIGHT …and the light… you must choose the light. Between the burn and the light, you must choose the light. Come here! -Come here! -Hey! Come here! -Come on, come here, coward! -Come, man! Come here! Come here! Come here! Hey! Come on! Come here, Stump! Come on, bottom's up! Oh, Sir. He's drunk. He's feeling good. Between the burn and the light, choose the light. Oh fuck! Son of a bitch! No. "Monster." My friends call me Monster. I was waiting for you, driver. But I'm not a driver. I thought that Gus was dead. No, but she might as well be. So now you're the driver. I calculated a reasonable exit maneuver. It's 30 meters from here to the front door. We can reach it in five seconds. But we won't have enough speed to break it. So we have to wait for it to be open. Okay. I'll come back tomorrow morning. No! Wait. Look at the prompter. No. The screen on the right. See the two Jeeps arriving? In 30 seconds, the guard will open the door for them and verify their papers before closing it again. That's when we go. Do you trust me? I don't know where the starter is. There isn't one, driver. The engine is already warming up. As soon as the door opens, I send the electrical impulse and the rest is up to you. You can free Little Brother. You were still able to get free. Well, old guy, it isn't too soon. A bonus to the one who brings me the driver's head. I think it's Stump. So bring me his other hand. Braking point. Stop! Left, 55 kilometers per hour. Full throttle. Stop! Go ahead, quick. We've covered five kilometers. The military isn't on my radar. Watch out. Danger! Wooden bridge with a weight limit. Oh my goodness. I spoke too fast. Military vehicles on my radar screen. -How many? -Three. But fast. Distance: 3,7 kilometers. Watch out. There's the bridge. Braking point. Stop! What kind of a winch do we have? Electric. Front-to-rear, cable resistance: 20 tons. Come on, driver, what are you doing? You're not abandoning me? How can I hear you out of the cockpit? -How far behind us are they? -3,12 kilometers. Probability of encounter: four minutes and 30 seconds. 2,3 kilometers. Probability of encounter: three minutes and five seconds. 1,6 kilometers. Probability of encounter: two minutes and 20 seconds. She's crazy. Five hundred meters. Probability of encounter: 32 seconds. How do we turn off the lights? Two hundred and fifty meters. Probability of encounter: 19 seconds. I don't think so. Hello, Major. Gus says hello. What are you doing here? She's our passenger. I neglected to tell you about this little girl: Princess. She was hidden in the toolbox. It can't be! How did you do it? I asked her if she wanted to come. She said yes. -And so I-- -You're crazy. You're completely crazy! I thought she wanted to escape from the fort. A military fort is no place for a little girl. However, a toolbox in a crazy truck that everyone's trying to shoot is the perfect place! That's a good idea, huh? Shit! If they had caught us, if we'd have been screwed? But they didn't catch us. End of story. I've almost finished putting the winch away. Get comfortable. The border will be the problem. The grays will be the problem. After the border. You don't care. You're at the movies. Where did you find that popcorn? It was Monster. Do you want some too? No. It's raspberry flavor. Very delicious! I'd prefer some coffee. It will be ready in two seconds. What luxury! Tired? The stretch we're taking is very busy. If you want to rest, I can drive. The word to access all the commands in my memory is "auto." Pronounced distinctly. "Auto." -How do you do it? -What? -Follow the road, I mean. -That's easy. I memorized it on a reconnaissance mission I did in another truck that was much more discreet. Radar confirms the memory and actualizes it. And I also know all the possible variations of routes in a 100-kilometer radius. Mati thought of everything. -Even the raspberry popcorn? -Yes. Who is Mati? The kid who plays with matches? He's the one who invented me, who programmed me. He's a genius. You and Mati will get along well. You'll meet him when we get to Terminus. Where is Terminus? To the west. Very far. Do we really have a mission? Of course. As I already said: go to Term-- Go to Terminus. I know. Is that all? For the most part, yes. The grays are trying to intercept us, but-- Who are these grays? Shit! I have the right to know! Mati thinks it isn't necessary to know everything. You must act spontaneously. Mati says that… Mati is starting to piss me off. …the spirit of the game makes you intelligent. Wait. I think we should stop. -Why? -The radar, driver. You must constantly watch the radar. I think there are trucks waiting for us five kilometers from here. Military. Look. We can go through the mountains and take the road that overlooks the valley. They won't see us? No, going up the plateau doesn't pose a problem. We'll be hidden from them by the cliff. Going down will be more difficult. No natural obstacle will conceal us from them, and their camp is only three kilometers away. What are you doing? I'm thinking. Do you need to bite your nails to think? Yes. Don't you? That's them, isn't it? Why are we only doing 40? The road is excellent. There's no detour. What are you talking about? I'm thinking about it because of Gus. There was construction and we missed the detour. Tell me later. -But-- -Later! Mati! Mati… We're gonna break our necks. -Mati… -Motor! Lights! Hey! Fall in! Everyone! I don't understand. That's the second time it's happened to me. Strange. The other time, it was with Gus, this detour after the intersection. This breakdown isn't normal. It's… I don't understand. Are they following us? Yes, driver. I want a distance every minute. Wait till they're at their maximum speed. How far away is the border? Speak, you hunk of metal! Two hundred and seventy-one kilometers. You see? Monster seems to be maintaining his progress. And even increasing it. Exactly. If all goes well, the military won't catch him before the border. Go rest. Wake me up when they arrive. What do you have in your truck? Meat. Only meat. I'll open the gate. It'd be a shame for it to spoil. Here's a view of the border, driver. What is this shit? Trucks waiting for customs to open at seven o'clock. And the groups outside the lines? Surely other military. Now, Mr. Know-it-all, calculate the width between the lines. On average: 4,5 meters. Our maximum girth is 3,6 meters. You want to go that way, driver? That's an interesting idea. No, but it's the only one. Wake up. Hold on. This is gonna make a bit of noise. Monster, listen to me carefully. You drive and I'll watch the screens. I'll intervene in case of a problem. Watch out! -Hurry up! Move! -Watch out! Change direction! Damn dog! The military is following us. It took them a while. Hey! Move it! Stop! Nobody seems to be following us. If we succeeded… I'm free. Do you hear that? I'm free! We shouldn't stay here too long. Yes, because the grays are still there. "The grays"? -Doctor? -Yes? Mati is asking for you. He says it's urgent. Yes? Doctor, I think a truck is following Monster. It appears and disappears. I don't understand. Like that. A few seconds and then… But it's very fleeting? Flickering slightly? Yes. It's probably an echo. A bit like a mirage. It might only be that. A diffraction effect from the laser beam in the highest levels of the upper atmosphere. Diffraction? Exactly. Shit! Is it possible to see the map for one second? The traffic conditions this morning-- I see the traffic. Give me the main directions. ZONE 3 - HIGHWAY ROUTE NO. 3 You only have popcorn to eat? The landmark of route number three is Newcrownstadt. I have sandwiches. Go ahead. One sandwich. Make it two. You seem nervous, driver. I'm not nervous. You could put it on automatic pilot and rest a while. I don't trust you, machine. Record that. What happened when we were going down? You're the one who missed the detour, not Gus. That's why they caught her. You're bringing up a delicate issue, driver. I experienced a breakdown of my radar surveillance system. I don't care about the technical details. Know why? Do you know why? I think I have elements of your answer but no certitude. If I believe the information from the black box, a single phenomenon seems to be present in both incidents. I think stress, a strong emotional overload… Stress? Emotional overload? You? That's a good one! It's a machine, understand? A heap of metal. It doesn't think. It has no feelings. It pretends, that's all. It's programmed to pretend. Is that really what you think? Yes. And the worst is that I'm talking to you like an idiot. Maybe because you don't believe what you're saying. Because deep down you really like me. -Me too, you know. -Stop whoring yourself. I'm driving this fucking truck, right? -What is "whoring"? -Don't play nice with me! Aren't you eating? You're not hungry? As you wish. After all, it isn't my problem. Eat it. To make him happy. He made it. It may be true that I don't have real feelings. But I want to learn. You can't learn how to have feelings. Why not? Because. Our driver is no longer driving the red truck. It's been a while since I realized that. Any news from Gus? He's an immigrant. Used to being in prison. Prison? A notorious drunk. And to top it all, he's crippled. He's a former truck driver. Five years ago, he fought with a soldier to defend children. To punish him, they crushed his hand. Ritualistic justice. He stayed in the village doing odd jobs, getting drunk, and regularly going to jail. He showed no desire to leave. And all of a sudden, he decided to steal our truck. In addition, he kidnapped a little girl. He didn't steal the truck. He's taking it to Terminus. If Monster let him in, he's honest. You can trust Monster, can't you? No, that's just it. There've been too many incidents. The construction then the mountain route. Yes, but if-- No. You must face facts. Monster is no longer reliable. He's defective. Not really. -He made a few mistakes, that's all. -A few mistakes? To err is human. It didn't happen during the trials. Yes, but I made improvements to his program. Of course, there are risks. But when you play, you have to take risks. Without risk, it's not fun anymore. Right? I didn't give you authorization. I thought it would make you happy. You really like experiments. How did they find out? They must have decoded our satellite communications. You seem worried. If the grays learned of the existence of Little Brother, it won't stop there. We'll have the media on our backs. An investigation! They know he exists. They haven't found him yet. If we must, we'll notify them. There's also Monster's driver. I think he represents a risk. You worry, Doctor. I'm starting to wonder if you're the right man to head our Little Brother research program. But it's my project! Really? Do you think it's possible for robots to have feelings? And emotions? I don't see the point. Sometimes, I'd prefer to be a robot. To feel nothing. To forget certain things. I'm boring you with my nonsense. …all governments concerned expect… …the electroencephalogram of the cat… …walking in Red Square… The Chinese reached a record price… …Kama Patella, John Bivinza had numerous civilians massacred including children… …which allowed the dictator… …confronted with this terrible fire… …the foolish hope of these freedom fighters… You both seem so sure that you'll make it this time that I hope Mati will finally see his inventions come to Terminus. That I hope Mati will finally see his inventions come… -Stump! Fast! -Shit! I'm afraid. Help me. -I'm afraid. -I'll take over. I'm in pain. Stump, I'm in pain. I'm in pain! Nice! My poor dear, here. We knew the Newcrownstadt passage would be delicate. After all, it's their base. The noose is tightening around Little Brother. Our calculations indicate that the grays have every chance of intercepting him. That would be very bad for us. Especially for you. You said that the grays were able to decipher one of our satellite codes. Especially for you. Especially for you. You said that the grays were able to decipher-- Monster just entered the industrial zone. If we let him filter information on his position, the grays will deploy at least a part of their presence on him. Oh fuck! Is it serious? I don't know. How do you expect me to know? Take the case. Tell me about the detour you missed with Gus. Gus was angry. That's why she… The radar wasn't working. Gus was angry because the radar wasn't working? No. The radar wasn't working… because she was angry. Does that seem logical to you? Does that seem logical to you? -No. -Why was Gus angry? I don't know. I don't understand. And that's my role: to understand. If I'm not able to, I'm just a heap of metal. It's impossible to understand everything. Why? Because I'm a stupid computer? That's it, right? Mati… Mati, I don't want to leave you. Mati, I'm afraid. Mati, I… But you're not Mati. No. It's me, Stump. I'm with the little Princess. We're here to help you. Are you in pain? It burns. It's my memories. That's what's hurting me. Why does it have to hurt so much? I don't know. It's like a flame. If you get too close, it burns. Sometimes you have to get close to warm up. Or to see in the dark. Between the burn and the light, choose the light. Does that remind you of anything? Memories are like that. Do your memories burn you too? Yes. Sometimes I feel like a big blob of clinker that's totally incinerated. You'd think that over time, the injury would cauterize, but no. Or that there'd be nothing left to burn. It isn't true. Deep down, I wonder if it's such a good idea to be human. No. But it's the only one. This time, I think we've got him. -Where is Mati? -He's here. I'm sorry, Mati. The truck reached Newcrownstadt as planned. But on his own, the driver decided to go into a garage. Why? We don't know. But as you can see, the grays found him. -And it is likely that-- -What about Little Brother, Doctor? Did he get through? I hope so, for your sake. But why did he have to go into that garage? Why? To fix the truck. Or Monster. That's the only explanation. Don't worry, Princess. I memorized the route. Hello. I'm one of the game inspectors for the big day. We captured the red truck. You lost! And normally, the game should be over. Unfortunately, during the game, a certain number of irregularities happened that we would like to clear up. First, we discovered satellite broadcasts that we were able to decipher. And to our surprise, certain broadcasts were sent to a second truck. Because there is a second truck, is there not? Little Brother. You know more than I do. Certainly not. But enough to interest the media and the authorities, yes. Sooner or later, we'll know everything. So will you explain? Tell us everything you know about Little Brother now. I am accountable. It's in your best interests as the game isn't officially over yet. There's still time to set up a very nice accident. Tomorrow morning, for the televised news. A magnificent conclusion to the game. The candidate stuck in his burning truck, unable to get out, burned alive on live television. Atrocious. But the public would love it. So? Even if I knew something, I wouldn't tell you. We'll meet over there to discuss the bonus. We're the ones who caught this bastard. I'm sure they'll try to con me. What are you doing? He's going to get the driver! You do know where Terminus is? To the west. Far. But where exactly? I don't want to know. Mati says that when you know too much… Mati? …it ruins the spontaneity. It will be tough, but it's doable. Aren't you proud of Monster? Did you see what he did? Did you see? Nothing will stop them now. All methods are acceptable to stop this game. Destroy Monster, Stump, and the kid. No mercy! With pleasure. Am I bothering you, Doctor? Listen, Mati. The grays probably located Terminus. We're evacuating. We have to get everything out as soon as possible. You're not allowed to do that. Not allowed? You have no idea of what's happening here. You must believe we took all these risks to allow you to play peacefully. It's not a game, Mati. Use the brain I gave you. You want to know the truth? You're nothing but a guinea pig. You're part of my research that's already out of date. The red truck, that man, and Monster mean nothing to me. They're nothing but bait for the grays. The guinea pig has already understood very mathematically that you're cheating. And that there's a secret laboratory here. We agree, correct? And Monster's arrival here will unmask you once and for all. Stump, your memories, even the worst ones, those that burn the most, those that hurt you, are they special to you? Why do you ask? Because of the doctor's experiments. That's what he tried to do to Mati: transplant memories. It didn't work. And he had to remove him from the artificial matrix. Oh no! -What? -More grays. Oh shit! Again! Watch out! There's one ahead! They're getting in each other's way. Stupid, isn't it? There's another one there. Easy! Doctor, that should interest you. Your truck is there too. I know. Mati, we're leaving. No. I'm staying. Bring him. Watch out! Don't continue! Or I'll tell you who Sir is and you'll all be dead. Because he'll eliminate all of you, one after the other. And you, too, Doctor. Yes, you too. Sir's anonymity is so important to him. Shall I continue? No! Stay here if you wish and get yourself killed, because what you said about Sir's anonymity goes for you too. You know too much. You are doomed. Wait. Stop. I can't see anything. My radar is scrambled. Hey, bastard! Princess, go in the back. Take the winch. We gotta get out of here. I think we have to help our friend. Take the headphones. Mom! Curiosity killed the cat. You are seriously injured. I'm afraid this is the end of the line for me. Me too. I can't drive anymore. My radar is dead. I think we're stuck here. I'll drive. There's a door at the base of the hill. I feel it. Princess! Stump! Princess! Mati? I think we won anyway. Subtitle translation by: Leanne Bordelais
