Wow, the third annual. And we'll get into specifics at dinner, but before we seg into the next part of the night, I wanted to share a little anecdote I thought you all would appreciate. Several weeks ago I was taking my morning run through the canyon like I always do. And on the winding road I found a man. He was sleeping in the bushes. He had no home. The sun had barely risen. There was nobody around. He wasn't even awake. This is a man who's probably suffering, who has no family missing him, who, in that moment, simply was. And even though I wanted to, I didn't do a thing about it. And that's where the story ends. [Laughs] I'd like to propose a toast. To Milo and his graduates!

Sweet Rebecca. Look how far you've come. And Jeremy and Cameron. Blood brothers, to coin a phrase. [Chuckles] And Oliver, do you remember the first time you sat across from me? The tears. Oh, my God, I thought you were going to die of dehydration. [Laughter] But look at you now, rosy cheeks beaming. And who can forget our hosts? You four have come a long way. You've all graduated. But beyond the walls of your tutelage, there's been learning and work beyond what I can teach. Learning about yourselves. Patrick. Would you care to start us off tonight? My name is Patrick Dawson. And I'm an addict. - Hello, Patrick. - Hello, Patrick. Hey, Dad. It's been four years and three weeks since the last time I, um... [Clears throat] [Sighs] I can't believe it. Anyway. I've learned to redirect my energy into other things. Into work. Exercise. Sex. For me, it's really about my family. [Clears throat] Do you miss it? [Sighs] Oh. Hey. Can I get you something? Okay. Tonight is a night of celebration, of speeches, of mourning and reflection. I... ...look around the table, and I'm in awe. Of all of us. I can't... can't find the... the words to express how I feel, so I have prepared a little something. Are you serious? I haven't done this, so please bear with me. [Chuckles] [Cackling] Was this you? Did you break my fucking... Did you break my fucking guitar?! - Oliver. - You piece of shit! - Oliver. - What's so fucking funny, huh? Huh? Look at me.

I can cut the power, but I can only do it for, I don't know, two-minute intervals before it restarts itself.

We just want to cut your fucking face off, okay? - [Laughing] - That's all. Is it such a big deal? Why won't she open the fucking door? What were you thinking? What do you mean, what was I thinking? Those kids aren't leaving this house alive, Milo. And who got ass-fucked and made you leader all of a sudden? Know your place, Patrick. I'm still the head of this family and the owner of this house. [Chuckles] The only reason you're living to good life in sunny-bunny Malibu and not rotting away in some maximum-security prison with come dripping out of your ass is because of me. Don't you ever forget that. Be a man, not a fucking chimp. Milo, what should we do about the kid in the bedroom? I'll have a word with him. You stay here and control your husband and son. Alexis, my dear, I need you to go downstairs and make sure those two idiots don't do something they'll regret. Honey... Calm down. Okay? [Screaming echoes in distance] [Knock on door] Young man, would you mind coming to the door so that we might be able to start sorting this out? Where's Iris? Oh, she's downstairs. Locked away in another room, I'm sure. You killed Dodge. Trust me, we are more sorry about it than you are. You see... ...I run a society of recovering murderers, and tonight was supposed to be an annual reunion to celebrate everyone's cleanness. But needless to say, that idea shit the bed. Now... and hear me now, for both of our sakes... my only goal here is to avoid any further bloodshed. You understand, yes? Then let us go. Well, yes, let's talk about that. Now, you say you want us to let you go, but what's to stop you from turning around and calling the police? I just want to go home, man. Just want to go home. Hmm... Here, kitty-kitty. Here, kitty-kitty. [Meows] - Iris. - Please go away. Please go away. Guys? Why don't you fuck the fuck off? Why don't you fucking make us, huh, baby face? [Grunts] Oh! Fuck off. Hey. It's Iris, right? Where's Casper? They're talking upstairs. [Sniffles] Iris? I'm gonna try and get us out of here. I'd be willing to, well, to settle on some kind of agreement. Say in the vein of, oh, $10,000? You butcher my friend. You want me to settle for 10 grand? Fuck that. $100,000. Hmm. I'd imagine that'll be fine. It will take some time to get that in order, though. Just stay put. What are you doing? Leveraging. $100,000? Are you out of your mind? It's just to get him calm and out of that room. Then what? We'll give them a strong narcotic, something significant. Then they can begin a junkie's life in earnest. - So you let them leave? - They'll get arrested. They'll be babbling out of their minds. I'll pull some strings to have them transferred to the facility. It's the only way. No. It's not the only way. The only way. We're not animals. Aren't we? Iris, the boys are gone. Back up. I'm not gonna hurt you. Why should I trust you? Because you have to. Come, come. - [Beeping] - Hey! What the fuck is this? They're trying to escape. Fuckers! Okay. Roxanne, go watch the kid. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Move. - What? - Fucking move! Hey, be careful where you point that thing, all right? - Go. Go. - Seriously. Okay. [Gasping] Get your fucking hands off of me! Think about what you're doing, son. We... Jeremy, that's enough! Jeremy, stop! Jeremy, I... Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy, stop! Hey! Let her go. I swear to God I'll blow her fucking head off if you don't let her go. Son, put the gun down. Aaah! Enough! Attaboy. I said that's enough! [Groaning] Not the face! [Moans] N-No, no, no, no. Patrick? Put it down, Patrick. No more killing! No! Get fucking off! Come on. Fuck. [Beeping] I love this thing. [Footsteps] I've been sober for six years, Patrick. You still are. This was all us. This was all of us. Milo always... Milo was a preening cult leader who can choke on his goddamn smugness, and you know it, so don't play that fucking card with me! Sweetheart. Sweetheart. I'm ready to make the Dawsons great again. That's Elliot's. Lucky us. Why are you helping us? 'Cause you're not the only ones who want out. Why didn't you just leave? It's a fucked-up situation. And I'm not gonna try to get you guys to understand it. Iris, go grab a couple of my dad's golf clubs. What's gonna happen? The windows are shuttered because you guys set the alarm off, but my dad's gonna reset it, and that's your only chance to get the fuck out of this freak show. What about you? They're gonna want to keep me, but if push comes to shove, they'll kill us all. [Retching] Hey, hey. Iris. Iris, listen. Breathe, okay? I know, I know. Just deep breaths. Look at me. I know, I know. But we're gonna make it out, I promise. I promise. I promise. Just breathe, okay? She's two months pregnant. We got to get her out of here. We will. Dad? Your sister... ...has been a bad girl. I had completely forgotten I put him down there. [Classical music-box music plays] You know what they call that, son? Hmm? Serendipity. [Laughs] Alexis, honey? There's no need for this. I know that we've all had our differences, and I know it's... ...been hard for you to adapt to this family, but I've always appreciated that you've tried. So in that spirit, why... ...why don't you come on out? Leave the other two. Just come on out. Okay. Just remember, we always loved you. We felt like you were... ...one of us... ...despite our differences. That's all for now. [Classical music-box music plays] What is that? What the fuck is that?!
