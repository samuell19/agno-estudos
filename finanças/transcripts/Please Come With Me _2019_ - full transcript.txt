(film reel rattling) (contemplative music) (lips smacking) (panting) (Collin grunting) (Kate moaning) - [Kate] I think that went pretty well earlier. - [Collin] What are you referring to? (both chuckle) - [Kate] I'm referring to our shoot. - [Collin] Uh-huh. What was that model's name? - [Kate] The annoying one? - Yeah. - Lauren. You were doing the humming thing again. - No. - You were. (chuckles) - (chuckles) No. - I swear to God. (Kate hums) - Oh my god, no. - And you were saying it, you were doing it in between directions, so you were like, could you stand right there, and then she couldn't really do it, and you were like. (hums) (Collin chuckles) - No, I wasn't. - Mm-hmm. - That obvious? - Yes, it was. - Oh my god. I was irritated, what do you want? - Yeah, I know. (Kate humming) (Collin chuckles) (Kate laughs) - Oh god. My mom used to call me out on that too. - Did she really? I didn't know she noticed. - You know, now that we're calling each other out on things, you like to sleep in the middle of the bed like this. Like, oh, yeah, Collin, there's just no room for you here. - I'm sorry, I'm just - On this California king. - trying to get closer to you. - Oh, that's a stretch. (Kate laughing) You do it when you're unconscious, like when you're sleeping. - Mm. (Kate humming) - Oh, well, I guess, (stammers) how am I, what am I supposed to do when I'm dealing with you? - With me? - Yeah, some annoying model. Am I supposed to say, uh-- - I'm not an annoying model. - I didn't call you an annoying model, but sometimes, am I just supposed to be like, hi, excuse me, I'm slightly frustrated. (Kate giggling) Could you please (chuckling) stop doing that? No, of course not. You kidding me? - No. You don't have to say it all formal like that but you could at least just try expressing yourself with words. - I think you're overrating expression slightly. (Kate chuckles) You know what, you should consider yourself lucky that I'm, uh, that, you know, you can know why I'm doing that because-- - Because most people just think you're a really weird guy who hums when he's frustrated? (Collin laughing) Is that what you're saying? (both giggling) - No, because you know me that well and most people just think that I can't carry a tune. - Honey, it's not really a tune. It's more of a grating, like. (humming) - (chuckling) Okay, all right. Okay, back to the question about the humming, it's just not always best to articulate what you're feeling with words. - I get you, I do. But you really can't give me too much shit for having an unconscious desire to be close to you. Don't you think it's a good thing? How many couples do we know who never touch in public or are super weird around each other and then when it comes up, you find out they only have sex like once a month or something? Don't you think our physical closeness is a reflection of our intimacy? That I want to be touching you while I'm sleeping? - Yeah, I can agree with that. - Mm. - But you are a restless sleeper. - (chuckles) I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go smoke. - Okay. (Collin sighs) Thanks. - If you let me smoke the occasional cigarette inside the house, we wouldn't have to be out here. - Sorry, honey. - Hold on. Stay right there. (floorboards creaking) (shutter clicking) (Kate inhales) - All right, I'm cold.

(Kate chuckles) - We met on that one shoot I did as a favor for Juliano. - Mm. - He's so intense. - (chuckling) Yes, he is. - Mm-hmm. - Anyway, Alex is great. She styles and can do makeup. I think she may be the perfect person to fill in. - Cool. Well, nice to meet you. - [Sofia] How's this? - Perfect. - Great. - Let's test, um... - So, is it official? Are you moving to San Francisco? - Most of my classes are Monday through Wednesday, so I can spend long weekends and still take jobs. - Wow, that's a lot of travel. It's crazy how you guys work together. I could never work with my boyfriend. Too much crossover for me. - Can you do hair also? - Yeah, I can do Last-Looks-type stuff, but nothing too complicated like a chignon. (both chuckling) - She's great, I promise. - Okay. Well, I'm gonna... - Yeah, I'll be right there. All right, I'm gonna get to it. (contemplative music) So, what do you think? - [Collin] I think it went well. - Not the shoot. - What? - Alex? - [Collin] She seems cool. - Good. I'm glad you liked her.

(soft chillstep music) - Are you really gonna play it like this? - Like what? - I'm gonna have my own work and I'll be traveling every week. I'm not just gonna rush down here to work for you. - Did I say that? (Collin sighs) Can you blame me for being disappointed? You know, I actually like working with you. I like spending time with you. I like having you around all the time. (Collin sighs) - It's hard to tell sometimes. - How can it be hard to tell? - Because you never say anything and I don't know, sometimes, it feels like we're just going and working and-- - What do you mean say anything? What do I have to say? I show you everything with how much I'm invested in you. I mean, why should I have to say something when my actions speak for everything? - I realize this is an adjustment. I do. - (sighs) I know. Just feeling sorry for myself. - Aw, is Mr. Cool Photography Man gonna miss me? (Collin sighs) Where are you going? - You know, I don't deserve to be fucked with. This is a big change. - This isn't easy for me either. Can we make this work? - Yeah. All right, I need to upload the photos. - Now? - I should get it done. - Okay. I love you. - I love you too. - I mean, we've looked at rings, he knows what I like, but I think he wants to be a little more financially stable. And because of school, I don't think he wants to be married and long distance. - He's probably right. It's better for you to focus on your career right now anyway. You and Collin, you're a thing. There's no rush. I'm sure he just wants it to be the right moment. I mean, you're not pregnant. - (laughs) Maybe that's it. Maybe I should just pull the goalie. - He's a stand-up guy. He'd do the right thing. - He would. Is that how you trick a millennial into proposing? - Yes, you have to force them into making a commitment. (both chuckle) - [Joey] Kate. - Hey, Joey. - Hey. How's it going? - [Kate] Good. - I saw the pictures you posted from your trip. They look incredible. - Thanks. Joey, this is Erin. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice meeting you. - Joey and I met a couple years ago through a friend of a friend who is kind of a big shot in Hollywood now. - Doing what I can, doing what I can. So, I don't see a ring. What, no proposal on this epic vacation? - We were just talking about this. - Well, you guys have been together for a while.

(chuckles) I just finished grad school. Now, I gotta pass this test so I've been studying. But I'm so done with academia. - Yeah, I didn't finish college. Kate did. She's all about education. - They say it's the only thing truly worth investing in. - How's it going out here? - Good. - Good. - Can you give me a hand with this bag? - Sure. - Thanks. - Did you need my help too? - I think I can manage. - Thanks for helping me move. - He's not exactly how you described him. - What do you mean? - Well, he's definitely nerdy. But he looks like a fucking underwear model. - (chuckles) I don't really see it. Is someone feeling threatened? - You're telling me nerdy bookworm, I'm seeing a guy that makes more money than me and spends all day in a fucking plank. - [Kate] He doesn't make more money than you. He's still unemployed. - He owns real estate. In San Francisco. - Why don't we hang out with him and you can get to know him better? I think if you spend some time with him you'll (chuckling) see what I mean. - Mm, okay.

Is this a mistake? - Kate, you got into every grad school that you applied to. It's not a question anymore of whether or not you're a good designer. - Yeah, but-- - Listen. You have an amazing eye. I know this. I've worked with you for the past five years. (Kate chuckles) I'm proud of what you're doing, figuring all this out. - I don't know why you won't just come with me. You're not working the next three days. I could really use the company and it would be nice to spend some actual time together, don't you think? - I have a ton of editing to do. - [Kate] Yeah, you can edit anywhere. - I can edit anywhere, but not well. Sitting in a stranger's living room on a laptop is not ideal for me. And I have a shoot next week. I don't wanna be run-down from the travel. - Run-down? I'm tired too, Collin. I'm going to school, working. It's tiring. - It doesn't make sense for me because you have a plane ticket and I would have to drive back and forth both ways by myself and I - I can cancel the flight - don't wanna make that drive - and drive up with you. - and go straight to a shoot. - It's only five hours. - Six, with no traffic. (Kate sighs) This is what we decided. I support you but I'm not coming up every weekend. I have to work. - Okay. - This is what you wanted. I told you it wasn't gonna be easy. - I understand. - I wanna spend time with you, but-- - It's fine. I get it. - I'll just come up another weekend when I have less going on.

We should hang out. I've never met your man. - We broke up a couple of weeks ago. - Oh, really, I'm so sorry to hear that. - Yeah, it sucks, but I think it's a good thing. - Breakups are tough. - Everything happens for a reason and it's been nice to have some time to focus on work. - Alex! Can I get that bounce back in? - Duty calls. (Kate chuckles) (contemplative music) - These engagement things are tough. - He didn't really understand the concept of smile.

You relax. - [Kate] Are you sure? - Yeah, enjoy the view. - You're not getting paid to lug this shit around. (chuckles) Lucky you. Off to the glamorous world of fashion.

Mm. This place is really good. - Yeah. So, how do you think it went today? - All right. I'm getting really tired of these engagement shoots. - Yeah. Well, maybe it's time to focus more on editorial work. - We'll see. So, what are we doing tonight? - I kinda wanted to stay in. I haven't been home in a while. Then again, we could give your drinking buddy Alex a call, see what she's up to. - My drinking buddy Alex? - Yeah. - You mean the girl that you replaced yourself with. - Seems like you two are pretty chummy. - Are you jealous? - It's hard. It's hard for me to see. I'm just alone in San Francisco, like, working, and you're just getting drinks all the time, you know, with (scoffs) my friend. - Hello, what about old Charles? Old Charlie Boy? - There's no drinking going on with old (chuckling) Charlie Boy. - That's sad. You should get the guy out, let him live a little. - I have a hard time believing that if I would say, oh, just going out with Charlie for some drinks, that you'd be like, oh, cool, sounds, have fun. - I mean, I've met him. Yeah, I would, I would encourage it. He needs a little life. - Okay, that's how you wanna play it. So, are you really good to stay in or you need to go and live your life? - Yeah, yeah.

I'm staying here a lot more than half a week. - It's good to have someone like you around. - [Kate] Well, it's hard to cook for one. - Yeah, I know. - What do you mean someone like me? - You're pleasant to be around. - Pleasant. (chuckles) Not something you hear often, but I'll take it. - I meant it in a good way. And I know how expensive being a student is. So, how come you've been staying up here more? - Mm, it's just too hard to go back and forth every weekend. Plus, Collin found someone to help him so there's less pressure for me to go down. - That makes sense. Gives you more time for your studies. Are you okay not seeing him as much?

You're right, (stammering) I can't. I can't forgive you right now. - Right now, or ever? - I don't know. - This doesn't feel right. (somber music) I still love you. (Collin scoffs) - Yeah, I just think maybe we should take a break. - I don't want that. I want our life back. I am sorry. (Collin sighs) (soft digital music) (engines roaring) - [Patrick] Have any twos? - [Kate] Go fish. (bird cawing) - [Patrick] Well, I will. - Sorry. Got any jacks? - How do you always do that? (Kate sighs) What's going on, babe? - (sighing) I don't know. - Have you heard from him at all? - Nope. And I don't think I'm gonna. - Hey, let's get outta here. You're gonna win anyway. - Okay. - Mother. We're leaving. Here. (soft music) - Yeah. - [Woman] Was it Quaker? - It was a apple shake. (man and woman chattering) - Thanks, man. - Yeah, dude. I know you wanna go talk to them. - Golf cart and golf course. (women chattering) - I really need a drink first. (Greg chuckles) - Okay. - Let's go.

What's going on with that? - I don't really know. He just said he needs time. - Okay, what do you need? - [Kate] What do you mean? - Well, Katie, these things don't happen because you're both happy, because everything's fine. Look. I love Collin, but he's been noncommittal since day one. I mean, he kind of only thinks about himself. - Yeah, you're right. He's basically put zero effort into our relationship this whole year. And a lot of our friends are getting engaged or married, and anytime I bring it up, he completely shuts down. - You know, he's one of those guys that's really into his work. It's what you like about him, it's what makes him interesting, but it's not conventional. I mean, you've known that the whole time. Look, the whole brooding artist thing, it's hot but it's... You can't expect the same things out of him that's happening for all your friends. - He is moody. And a little pretentious sometimes. - He is by far the moodiest heterosexual I ever hung out with. (Kate laughing) (Patrick chuckling) - Yeah. - You guys are good together but it seems like you are going in this direction and he's not getting on board. You've been together for a super long time so you're just at this point where it's like, you know, what's next? But Katie, you have to do what's gonna make you happy. I mean, this is your dream. He's gotta understand that if you wanna make it work. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, I still fucked up. It's my fault. I mean, how long would it take you to get over something like that? - I know, I know, but you see what I'm saying. - [Kate] I do. - Seriously, it was one time, okay? And you told him about it right away and you ended it. - I know, but it still happened and I don't wanna diminish that because he really is hurt by it. - I get that, it just, it seems like you are really hurt by the way he's been treating you the last nine months. Whatever you do, whatever happens, I'm here for you. I just don't wanna see you give up on what you want. (Kate sighs) - Fuck. - That's all. - Are you with me here? - Yeah. - Look, I know that you're down right now. I just, you gotta remember that you didn't do anything wrong, all right? Look, the situation that you're in, you can't beat yourself up about it. - It's more complicated than that. - Look, we all love her, all right? Kate is a great girl. But she fucked up. So, you don't have anything to be sad about. If anything, you should be angry. - (clears throat) I am. - No, I know, dude, I know. I want you to try to have fun, okay? - I am. - Really? This is your I'm-having-fun face? Whew, man, okay. All right, well... (Collin sighs) - Dude, it's not that easy. - No, no, no. Cheers. To your I'm-having-fun face. (glasses clink) - Cheers. To my I'm-having-fun face. - Whoo! Come on, let's get out there, all right? Some girl out there is gonna make you marginally happier. (knocking) - Come in. - It's coming along in here. We're gonna get drinks around the corner. You wanna come? - I think I'm gonna finish unpacking. Thanks, though. - Well, we'll be there for a while if you change your mind. - Okay.

Keep this party train going, otherwise how hungover I am. - That sounds good. I gotta figure out what to do with this girl. - Just bring her, dude. She seemed cool. - (sighing) Yeah, I don't know about that. - Hey, she have any friends? (mellow funky music) (jet engines roaring) (fingernails tapping) - You're gonna have to come out with us sometime or we're gonna think you don't like us. - Okay, I'll text you when I finish this and see where you are. - Sure. - I will.

The more girls I have sex with, the more I just feel like shit. - Well, that's a perfectly normal reaction. - I, uh, (clears throat) I end up just missing Kate even more. - I wish Megan was awake to talk to you, man. (Collin laughing) (both laughing) - Dude, you're good enough, man. How is she, though? Is she good? - She's fine, she's good. She's, you know, busy. - Busy's good. - Do you remember what happened when we broke up? - Not specifically, no. - Well, okay. We were in a very serious argument because I would vanish for work trips, as she would put it, out of range, and she was right. I mean, I would disappear, just check out for a few days. Anyway, I thought about it and I heard from her point of view and I tried to imagine what it'd be like if she were the one that was out of range. I changed my tune. - Hmm. - I did, I had to eat crow and recognize that I had contributed to the space that was between us. - Yeah, I mean, that's, that's a lot. (chuckles) That's a lot. - More simply put, it is my medical opinion that strange will not cure your condition. You have to talk to Kate. (somber music) (liquid sloshing) I set you up on the couch if you need it. Come on. (glasses clink) (women giggling) - [Erin] I was hoping, yup. - [Sam] That's amazing. - Okay, wait, wait, wait, we can do better. How about this guy? Nick, 29, pictured with his dog. - He's cute. - Oh, we got her with that dog profile pic. - I wanna meet someone organically. - Brian, 31, head of digital marketing. Funny caption. - I'm not driving to Long Beach. - [Sam] Parameters. - Don't you think it's a little demoralizing to date solely based on a few photos and a self-constructed idea of who they are based on age and proximity? - Mostly proximity. - It's completely demoralizing but it's also a good way to find out what you like and what you don't. - Within a five-mile radius. - Well, yeah, of course. - Besides, Kate, where have you been? This is how people meet now. Chris, 22, went as King Baby for Halloween. - I'm not feeling the apps. - I hear your organic argument, but this is it. Everyone does it while they complain about it. It's just a part of life. - Yeah, but if you wanna meet someone organically, you should move to a small town. - Oh no. You think this is bad? Wait until you come across Collin on there and forget it. I... - Yeah. - Downer? (all chuckling) (somber music) - This guy, I'm gonna rip him apart no matter what's being read. (diners chattering) And this is the opposite. Like I said, it's all people, different ages, different groups, different whatever. Yeah, it's a beautiful thing. It's every Saturday. Like I said, I. Well, I gotta say, I'm really glad that we could finally get together. You know, I always thought you should be with a guy that's crazy about you. (Kate chuckles) - Thanks. This was fun. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool. You sure you don't wanna grab another drink somewhere? - It's tempting but I have this thing I have to go to. - A thing? - Mm-hmm. - Well, that's vague. What are you, double-dipping tonight? Got another date lined up after me? Trying to maximize your time? (Kate laughing) - No, it's an art show for a photographer I used to work with. - This is me. - Oh, okay. I'm really just trying to make an appearance and go home. - Ah. - Yeah. - Well, have fun. - Thank you. - I'm not gonna kiss you tonight 'cause, well, I wanted it to be natural and maybe a little bit drunker. - (laughing) That sounds good. - I'll call you. - Okay. (Kate chuckles) - All right. - Night. - Hey, you look beautiful tonight, Kate. - (chuckling) Thank you. (contemplative music) - Kate? Hey. - [Kate] Are you leaving? - Yeah, I've been here for a little bit. - How is it? - Uh, eccentric. (Kate chuckles) How have you been? I heard about you and Collin. He definitely wasn't himself without you around. - Didn't seem that way. I basically spent all this year between here and San Francisco while he worked and went out. - He didn't really go out all that much. - Mm. - Well, half the time, I would go over there and he'd be in his bathrobe, smoking in the house, like an old spinster. - Well, it's good to see you. - You too. Kate? Really sorry. - Hey, Kate, it's Collin. When you get a chance, give me a call back. I hope you're doing well. (phone chiming) (Collin clears throat) Hey. (chuckling) Mm. I've been a mess. - [Kate] I'm sorry to hear that. - Where you been staying? - Erin had an extra room in her apartment. It's nice. I'm just a little tired of moving. - Remember that time we moved you out of that house into our place? (chuckling) - I remember you throwing my mattress out the third-floor window, yes. (both chuckling) - Hey, it worked, didn't it? Look. I was proud. I wanted to act like everything was fine. But it wasn't. I just felt like you wanted it to be over with immediately, like nothing happened. - I wasn't trying to do that. - Okay. - It felt like, for the first time, I wanted to do my own thing. And you weren't there for me. That has to count for something. Obviously, I'm always going to regret what happened. But there were things that were wrong before that. - I hear that. - It was completely unfair and immature of me to let that manifest into something. I was confused. I thought you were cheating on me with Alex. (Collin sighs) (Collin groans) (Collin sighs) (somber music) - You know, I really want this to work out. I still have feelings for you. But there's a part of me, I gotta be honest, it feels like you're still just making excuses and that you've never really apologized. And that you have no regrets. - I made a mistake. I absolutely think it was wrong. I would be so devastated if the table were turned. But it happened and then it was over. I didn't carry on. I tried to be honest. If you wanna be with me, you have to forgive me. When I talked about going back to school, I thought you would propose or we'd at least talk more about getting married. - Things aren't the same. - No, they're not. At what point are we gonna move forward with our lives, Collin? I need to protect myself. I don't wanna feel insecure all the time. I wanna feel like we're partners. - I don't know. I'm just, I, (sighs) I need more time. (stammering) How am I supposed to trust you as my wife if I know that you're capable of this? - All I can do is tell you how much I love you and show my commitment to repair this. At a certain point, it's your choice. Is it a studio or a one-bedroom? Okay. And it's right off Columbus? (melancholy music) (photos rustling) - How much longer? I'm losing daylight. - I need a second. - I don't have a second. Is that what he's wearing? - I have something else I could layer on. - Forget it. Let's go. (camera beeps) Um, white side. Flip it, please. (camera beeps) (Collin humming) (shutter clicking) Sorry. - [Kate] You're my first call when I have some money for bonds. - [Charles] I would hope so. So, you're back for another semester? - [Kate] Mm-hmm. I'm subletting an apartment up in North Beach. - [Charles] How are things with Collin? - [Kate] I don't really know. We're not together right now. I don't know if we can recover from what happened. We tried. You seeing anyone? - Actually, I am. It's a couple of months now. We share an affinity for bonds. (both chuckling) I'm very sorry about what happened. - You shouldn't be, it was completely my fault. It had nothing to do with you. - Well. - Well, (chuckling) obviously, it did, but what I'm saying is you shouldn't feel bad. I wasn't in the best place emotionally and, you know, I'm just very sorry for everything. - If I've learned anything from my work it's that the world can be very unpredictable. - Yeah. (phone buzzing) (park visitors chattering) Hey, what's up? - [Kate's Mom] Kate, honey, your brother Patrick has been in an accident. I need you to come home. (somber music) (soft dramatic music) (Kate sobbing) (Collin shushing) - [Collin] I'm so sorry. - [Kate] It happened so fast. (Kate sniffles) - Do you wanna go inside? - It's been a really long day. Wanna take a walk? - Sure. (contemplative music) I like your dress. - Thanks. We wanted it to be a celebration of his life. - Mm. I'm sure he would've appreciated that. - My parents are a total wreck. - I can't even imagine. - I don't even know if it's hit me yet. - When I heard, when Erin called me and told me what happened, I had to get on a plane right away. I just couldn't bear the thought of you going through this alone. I know we've been going back and forth a lot about all the wrongs we've done to each other, but we haven't just stopped to think about all the right. You know, what happened, it hurt me, yeah, sure. But why did it happen? (chuckles) You know, it's because we spent so much time talking about work and school, traveling back and forth from city to city, that we lost all the closeness that we had in the bullshit. And then something like this happens. (sighs) All the bad shit just went out of my mind. I can't stand the thought of not being here for you. I hate that it took a tragedy like this for me to see it, but I see it. (contemplative music) I see it clearly. - (sighs) Come on.
