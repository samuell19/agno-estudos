[chuckles] ♪ All aglow ♪ ♪ Glow ♪ ♪ Your branches ♪ - Thank you. - You're welcome. [man] Have a good one. [James] That's a nice tree you got there. [man] Yours are always the best, Mr. Pine. All right, this is what you wanna do. When you get it home... you're gonna wanna cut maybe an inch or two inches off the bottom. We cut this maybe a couple of days ago so the sap has probably clogged the pores a little bit. You wanna keep it hydrated. [James] And if you wanna keep it green, my secret is you put a little aspirin in the water. Don't get that tree-saver water off the streets. No, it doesn't work, and it's much more expensive. I've always been impartial to a little sugar myself. - Ah, Julie. - [chuckles]. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Good to see you. Uh, folks, I'll be right with you. My daughter's home for Christmas. I thought I was gonna pick you up at the airport. Well, my flight got in early. I figured I'd surprise you. Well, that's my kinda surprise. Merry Christmas, Dad. Oh, Merry Christmas. Good to have you home. - Hey. - [Julie] Hey, Bear. What are you doing still calling me that for? Because I've always called you Bear. Come on, get over here. Wait till you see the pranks we got planned for the Spruces this year. - Uh, Josh? - Yes. [James] Can you put this tree on these nice people's car? [Josh] Mm-hm. - And we'll get you all set. - Okay. Have you seen Spruce's latest stunt? He's got a clown outside his farm. I think he's an elf. He's twirling a sign like it's a used-car lot. He's just trying to attract customers. Yeah, well, he's scarin' away ours. - Dad. - Hm? [Julie] Is that a naked Christmas tree? [James sighs] Well, I was waiting for you to come home. I thought it needed your eye. Mm-hm. You got frustrated untangling the lights again, didn't you? Every January, I put those lights away, neat as a pin, and every December they, they explode like some darn tornado. Just takes a little patience. Thanks for waiting, Dad. Good to have you home. It's good to be home. Hm. - Uh, need a hand with your bags? - No, I'm good. Uh, Julie... I've been, uh... going through your mother's things. Slowly, but truly. Promised myself I'd get it all sorted out by New Year. Well, get those clothes over to Goodwill. Yeah. I can't believe it's almost been a year. Um, any-anyway, uh, it's... all up in our room. Take a peek and... keep anything you'd like. I'll do that. Thanks, Dad. Okay. [instrumental music] I think it's time to get a new register. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But it is broke. Well, you know what I mean. Come on. [register dings] Ah! There we go. Perfectly fine. All right, put me to work, Boss. Oh, why don't you just enjoy your vacation? Our vacation starts on Christmas morning. Same as it always has. I know you're short-staffed without Mom. Let me help you. All right. - Martha's truck is in the shop. - Mm-hm. Can't make the deliveries, so if you could go into town and pick 'em up, that would be a help. Yeah, sure thing. Uh, Josh is about to make a delivery so you hitch a ride with him. - Oh, great. - That would be great. Oh... Julie, you know how he is with pastries. Ooh, good call. [grunts] Hey, want a co-pilot? Yeah, always. For some reason, Dad doesn't trust you with the pastries. Now, where would I have gotten that reputation? No idea. - Let me give you a hand. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. [man] Ho ho ho ho. - [Julie] Hi, Martha. - Here we are. Six orders of gingerbread. Six, uh, apple cider muffins and a little somethin' extra. - I can help you. - No, I got it. - Careful. - [Josh] I got it, I got it. Maybe I should have tied those shut. [Julie] Maybe you should have. [Martha and Julie laughing] Oh, it's nice to see you. I hope this means you're here to stay. Oh, no, it's just a visit. I've one more semester. Well, your dad loves braggin' about all your accomplishments at school. We're real proud of you. Thanks. Oh, no, no, no. It's-it's okay. - Oh, come on, it's the holidays. - Okay, just one. [Martha] Think of it as an early graduation present. This is good. Mm. By any chance, are you heading straight back to the farm? Mm-hm. I was hoping you could make a little detour. - Sure. - To Spruce Farm. [coughs] You're kidding? You're not kidding. I know I'm asking a lot, but I, I just don't understand why you can't visit a neighbor without starting World War III. You're up to something. It's just the two boxes. Was this a gift or a bribe? Mm. [exhales] Feel like you could just... drop 'em off at the front counter. Me? Uh, yeah. I'm not going in there. I'm not going in there, either. - Bear! - No. I'll rock-paper-scissors you. - [sighs] Fine. - Good. - No! - Oh. - See ya. - Will you go in with me, please? No. Just go. Please. - All right. - Thank you. I gotta do everything around here, huh? - Is that it? - [Julie] Thank you. Why did we agree to this again? Guilt, mainly. And a cookie. Yeah. Well, I just feel... I feel weird, you know, like we're gonna get ambushed or something. What do you think they're gonna do? String us up with some tinsel? I don't know. Maybe. Come on. Looks like we got lucky. Yeah, let's get out of here. Happy holidays! [Dave] Can I help you two with any... Oh, it's you. It's nice to see you too, Mr. Spruce. Martha asked us to drop these off for her. Her truck broke down. I told her I'd pick 'em up myself. You're welcome. Have a nice day. That guy's the worst. You were just doin' him a favor, you know? Ah, it's the same as it's always been. Yeah, it's even worse this year. What do you have? A brownie. I stole it from the box. - Bear! - What? He deserved it. You shouldn't have done that. You should've taken a whoopie pie because those are bomb. Look, they can't even help their customers tie a tree to the roof of their car. - Whoa, where you going? - Uh... - To help him. - Why? This is the kind of customer service you get when you buy from a Spruce. Next time, he'll learn his lesson, and he'll buy from us. [sighs] Finish your brownie and warm up the truck. All right. Having trouble? No roof-rack. You've got an eye for detail. [chuckles] I don't know where to tie it. [chuckles] All right. Take this, and loop it around the trunk twice. Yes, ma'am. This your first tree? Oh, I grew up with a plastic kind that came in a box. Oh, God. All right. Hop in. [grunts softly] So, grab the other end. And loop it through. Yup, and then cinch it up real tight and you're gonna wanna do the same thing in the back and then you're all set. The way I was doing it, I would have tied the door shut. [chuckles] - I'm Rick. - Julie. Hey, you really helped me out of a bind. Can I return the favor? Buy you a coffee? I do love coffee. But it's not necessary. Hot chocolate? Merry Christmas. [exhales] Let's go. You know, I cannot believe you helped them out, not once but twice today. It's Christmas, haven't you ever heard of "peace on earth" and "goodwill towards men?" Yeah, I have, but they have not. We did our good deed for the day. And plus, now we never have to see a Spruce again. - So, let's go. - Oh, really? 'Cause there's a spruce there's a spruce, there's a spruce. They're all over the place, Julie. - You're ridiculous. - We're never getting rid of 'em. [Dave] Need any help? Nope. She ain't going anywhere. - Whose tree is this? - You're all set. Hah. I see you took my advice about the tree-saver water. It's the best choice you ever made. Thank you. Thanks again for stopping by. I told 'em to warm up in the gift shop while I took care of their tree. I like the way you think. Lure 'em in with cookies and cocoa and get 'em to impulse buy. It's all about treating your customer right. Nice work, kid. Keep it up. Thanks, Uncle Dave. Julie. What's wrong? I got a message from Dave Spruce. Oh, Dad, I was just... What were you doing over there? It's not a big deal, I was doing a favor for Martha. - She asked... - It is a big deal. I don't want you anywhere near that farm or that family, okay? Trust me, it wasn't my idea. I don't need to have my blood pressure get run up worrying about the damn Spruces. Christmas is hectic enough. It won't happen again. I promise. Thank you. I'm sorry. - You girls doing okay? - [girl 1] Yeah, we're good. - Good. - [girl 1] Thanks. Good morning! [Julie] Morning. Can I have a coffee, please? That all? And a plain doughnut. It's on me. Hey, Julie. What are you doing here? Uh, you know, just grabbin' a quick cup of coffee. He's been here for an hour. By himself. [Rick] Okay. Maybe I'm just waiting to see if a certain someone is gonna come in to the only coffee shop in town. No, I really don't need you to pay for my coffee. Well, what if I want to? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Did you really wait around all day to see if I'd come in? I did. [chuckles] The only thing I know about you, is that you like coffee. So... can I see you sometime? Can I get another doughnut? So, is that a yes? Like you said, there's only one coffee shop in town. I'm sure I'll see you around. All right, let's get this straightened out. Uh, let me see that tag again, please. Now, who sold you this tree? - That guy, right there. - Ah. Did you sell these nice people a tree, Rick? Yeah, they came in earlier looking for a blue spruce tree. - Is there a problem? - Sure is. You sold 'em a balsam fir. Really? [Dave] Yeah, they brought the tag. I'm awfully sorry, folks. My mistake. Rick... a fir is just a pine. It's soft and thin. [stammering] The branches bow under the slightest weight. Now, a spruce, that is a noble tree. You can hang a bowling ball on that tree. Yes, Sir. Ah, you gotta know the difference between a pine and a spruce, Rick. It's our family name, for Pete's sake. Won't happen again. I'm sorry, folks. Let me get you a Spruce Farm spruce tree. Be right back. Hey, Holly. - Can I get a hot chocolate? - Sure. How's your first week? Okay. But, boy, I got a lot to learn. Marshmallows? I'd love some, thanks. What's that? It's a notebook to help keep things straight. I think my uncle is starting to lose patience. He's probably on edge because of what happened the other day. What happened? Oh, my God, didn't you hear? No. What? He had a run-in with a Pine. - A tree? - No, an actual person. - The family down the road. - Oh, yeah. They don't get along very well, do they? Understatement. We are sworn enemies. They actually dared to trespass on our property. Seriously? You want something for your notebook? Write this down. "Stay away... from the Pines." [Rick] Duly noted. Thanks. [music playing on record player] What do you think? Mm, up a little. Oh, this one? - There. - Okay. Good. Dad, I cannot believe you still have this. You made that for me when you were five. Of course, I still have it. It's missing an eyeball. And a leg. It has character. What's the story with this one? A tree for a tree? That was a wedding gift from your grandparents. They thought it was fitting. Your mom and I got married right here on the farm. Been such a big part of our lives growing up that there really wasn't even a second choice. We set up chairs by the gazebo and your grandma strung all these little white lights all over it. Would've been a beautiful place for a wedding... until the... The blizzard. I told you about that? Mm-hm. Once, twice, three times. Yeah, your mom said, if... if rain on your wedding is good luck, we must be blessed. And we were. - Good? - [Julie] Perfect. I think we're ready for our star. [Julie] Okay. [clears throat] [Julie] It's not in here. It must be in there. That star has been on top of your mother's Christmas tree ever since she was a little girl. We could just use a bow this year. I don't think it would be the same. We'll find it, Dad. Yeah. How's it going, man? People being generous? Best wishes to you and your family this holiday season. Hey, I can see that you're in a hurry, so, I'm sure you just didn't see our friend with a bucket here. [Rick] That's a nice suit! Saw one of those on a senator once right before I sold his kid a Town Car. Hey, what do you say, how about you help give the kids a merry Christmas? You know, you're good. [laughter] - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. And Happy New Year. I'm from Texas, grew up on a used-car lot. My dad's a salesman. People say I take after him. He was quite the charmer. Well, I can see that you're pretty charitable. I have been told I'm persuasive. I once sold a convertible to a man with a toupee. Am I making any headway here? [giggles] A little. Huh. Must be losing my touch. [chuckles] So, you lived here all your life? Yeah, most of it. I spent the last couple of years at school. What're you studying? Horticulture. Like, plants and trees? Yeah. Ha-ha. Oh, speaking of trees, did you get yours all set up? From the other day, when I helped you. Oh, that wasn't my tree. [chuckles] Did you steal it? No. I sold it. My first official sale, actually. Wait, you work there? Yeah. - At Spruce Farm? - Yeah. But you couldn't even tie a tree to a roof. Well, you don't have to rub it in. Well... [chuckles] Oh, uh... I thought you were a customer. I had no idea that you were on staff. Yeah, it's my uncle's farm. Hey, wait up! Hey, Julie, hold on! - Did I say something? - Unfortunately, you did. What? Sorry, this isn't going to work. You're kinda giving me whiplash here. Your uncle is Dave Spruce? - You're Rick Spruce? - Yeah. Julie Pine. - As in... - Pine Farm. Yeah. - Is it really a problem? - You don't understand. Our families have despised each other ever since I can remember. They run rival farms, I think competition is expected. No, it's more than that. It's personal. To them, maybe. Not you and me. Look, you seem nice. But this is a mistake. She's a real beaut. A tree that just screams Christmas spirit. Real compact for a family on the go. No? All right. Well, you could always grab a saw and find one down the field that suits you. We'll find a home for you, little buddy. [boy] Daddy, I'm tired. Here we go, little guy. Just a little further down here. [instrumental music] [keys clinking] - Hey. - Whoa! Oh, my God, you scared me. Serves you right. Why? What did I do? Oh, I found a whole stocking full of charcoal on my front step this morning. You been naughty? Someone thinks so. - Is that your handiwork? - I wish it was. Would have been a pretty good comeback for you stormin' out on me. You know, you weren't the only one who received a mysterious present this morning. Really? Well, I found a little somethin' outside the gift shop. What was it? Two batteries with a note that said "Gift not included." [chuckles] That's pretty funny. You didn't have anything to do with that, did you? Nope. [chuckles] You know, I've lived next farm my entire life. I don't think I've ever stepped foot in this barn. [laughing] That's just wrong. I knew you Yankees were stubborn, but I've been learnin' a new meanin' of the word. Listen, I can't stay. If I get caught here again, my father is going to kill me. Uncle Dave never comes in here. Not while we're open. So, how do you like tree farming? I got a lot to learn. But sellin' is sellin'. How about you? I'm hoping to take over the farm someday. I wouldn't say that selling is one of my strong points but I can grow anything, so... Sure could use a few tips from you. I don't know a spruce from a pine. I do know motors, that's for sure. Well, you should play to your strengths. That's what I would say. - That's good advice. - [Julie] Hm. Listen, Rick, I have to go. I'm starting to get really nervous being here. Tell me more about the feud. [sighs] Another time. We'll grab coffee. My treat. I'll hold you to that. Oh, and tell whoever it was that left the coal it was a pretty good prank. [chuckles] I will. But they should watch their back. 'Cause us Pines don't mess around. Right. Here's your change. Thanks for comin' in. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. What? "Gift not included?" Yeah, I don't know what you're talkin' about. Nice. Hey, check out our mittens. [chuckles] - Quiet day? - It won't be this weekend. Hope not. You wouldn't happen to know anything about a stocking filled with coal at the Pine Farm, would you? Um, how, how would you know about that? A little birdie told me. What little birdie? Doesn't matter. I want in on the next one. Really? Oh, my gosh. Okay. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] This is so much better than last year's prank. - You have no idea. - We do things big in Texas. [Julie] Hm. Nice. Upside-down Christmas tree. [music continues] [knocking at door] Now! [exhales] This is a good one. Stop doing that. You're gonna give me a heart attack. Would you look at what I found when I opened up the barn this morning. What? You think I had somethin' to do with that? [chuckles] Oh, yes. And I think you're gonna have something to do with taking it down before my father sees it. Fine. Well, shouldn't we be worried he might find us? He is at a Chamber of Commerce meeting this morning. We have plenty of time. So, what are we doin'? I owe you a coffee. - That's right, you do. - Mm-hm. But I have a confession to make. Is it worse than being a Spruce? I don't really like coffee. But I do like you. So, I'm four years old, and my parents tell me we're gonna go visit my uncle for Christmas. Now, I'd never been there. Heck, I'd never left Texas. So, after five hours on a plane and two hours in a car, we finally pull up, and I can't believe it. Uh, there's trees, and lights, and snow. I thought it was the North Pole. What? You did not. I did. Well, I'd never seen anything like it before. And back then, my Uncle Dave had a very impressive beard. [Julie] Oh, man. Anyway, that trip always stuck with me. Even after I found out the truth. See, I always thought I was gonna follow my dad's footsteps, working on the lot. But when my uncle mentioned that he was lookin' for someone to take over the farm, I bought the ticket that day. I-I just have all these ideas, you know? Wait. Was the tacky elf sign your idea? You think the elf was tacky? [laughs] Oh... I thought it was fun, and sure, a little goofy, but who doesn't like elves? I guess I'm just a little more traditional. I'd call it conventional. Respectful. I don't know, I like tradition. It keeps us connected to the past. Yeah, well... I try to keep my eye on the future. Well, this is a Christmas tradition that every tree farmer should know. [Rick] Are those pine needles? [Julie] Yup. And you put those in the tea? They are the tea. My mom would make this for us every winter. - Here you go. - Thank you. Go on. What do you think? It's like Christmas in a cup. - Cheers. - Cheers. [Julie] This is where my parents were supposed to get married. [Rick] What happened? [Julie] A blizzard. - [Rick chuckles] - [Julie] Yeah. [Rick] That'll do it. [Julie] Yeah, I mean, we are hardy New Englanders but I guess it was quite the storm, so... [Rick] Wow, you have apple orchards too. My mom loved this view. Loved? Yeah, she died last winter. This will be our first Christmas without her. I'm sorry. I'm glad you stopped by. Yeah? Yeah. So, you're big on Christmas tradition. What was that? [laughs] Oh, no, that's not mistletoe. It's holly. - Really? - Yeah. Mistletoe has white berries, holly has red berries. Are you sure? I'm positive. Hm. What is that? It's my cheat sheet for all the Christmas and tree-form trivia I'm expected to know. - Really? - Whoa. Hey, give it back. No, I finally have the Spruce Farm trade secrets. Are you kidding? "To help with absorption, store in warm water." Hm. That's actually a myth. Great! Can I have it back now? "Stay away from the Pines." It was mentioned. It's underlined, twice. [Rick] Well... maybe that's one of the things we can change around here. Hm. [instrumental music] [bell jingling] So, there's something I wanna talk to you about. - It's bad news. - What? You brought me here for breakfast so you could butter me up. That's not why... Okay, it is about the Spruces. - So it is bad news. - Mm. Uh... [sighs] - Let's go. - Dad. We're not even finished yet. Leavin' so soon? Rick, this is the man I've been tellin' you about. You see that? I haven't seen something move that fast since I caught that fox up by our hen house. You wanna say that to my face? Okay, boys, I won't have any of your silly feuding here in my shop. You know, a man only retreats that fast when he knows he's guilty as... Cinnamon roll? No, thank you, Martha. But would you mind telling Mr. Pine that the stink from the manure on his rustic farm is making children cry over at my place? I'm not getting in the middle of this. Martha, could you inform Mr. Spruce that I know his overpriced tree-saver water is just a scam to make a buck. - Dad! - Scam? Heh. And how about your daughter trespassing on my property? Don't you bring Julie into this. Why don't you be a good father and keep her in line? - How dare you say... - All right. Let's just calm down. Both of you, knock it off! [Martha] You're acting like children. Let's go, Dad. Come on. [Dave] It's a good lesson for you, Rick. [Rick] Well, now I see what everyone's been talking about. [Julie] I don't remember it ever being this bad. What did your dad do? Run over my uncle's dog? It all happened before I was born. And all I know is what my dad's told me. It was about, like, 30 years ago, there was this fire. It started when your uncle was burning some brush and it made its way over to our land and... burned our entire crop. That doesn't sound so bad. It was an accident. No. It was neglect, he was reckless. We lost an entire seven years of growing. Did the Spruces lose their crop, too? Well, yeah. Okay, so how do you think that story goes down when my uncle tells it? I didn't think of that. They blamed each other, didn't they? My dad never ever got over it and neither did your uncle. My father used to tell me there are three sides to every story. Yours, theirs, and the truth. Don't you figure what really happened is somewhere in the middle? You're probably right. But the bigger question is what does that mean for us? [Josh] Forty-five... [Julie] I don't know, I mean... [Josh] Forty-seven... What? [Julie] I don't know, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [Rick] No. Hey, hey, listen. [Josh] What? No. No, no, no, no, no. Meeting you... It's the first time I felt like I made the right decision. You really make this place feel like home. Oh, come... Look, this is crazy. [Rick] I'm not gonna tiptoe around this town just 'cause I wanna be with a girl named Pine. It's just the way it's always been. Well, it's not gonna be that way anymore. [instrumental music] [cranking] [Holly] Rick? Rick, are you, are you in here? [Rick] Hey! Under here. What are you doin'? Gotta get this old tractor runnin'. Ain't she a beaut? - What for? - Hayrides. Drive the families with their kids down to the fields so they can pick out a Christmas tree. Talk about the magic of Christmas. Yeah, that's a great idea. I just play to my strengths. Okay, well, when you got a minute, Dave's looking for you. - What for? - Didn't say. Huh. Hey, Holly. What do you know about this squabble between us and the Pines? I don't really know. The pranks are fun, though. Seems a lot more serious than that. Yeah, you're right. This year does seem worse. Well... you heard about the fire. Yeah, I have. But there has to be more to it. All I know is they just don't get along. - Never have. - Never? [sighs] Maybe not never. Okay. - Hey, Bear. - Yeah? What's been going on since I left? Mr. Spruce seems angrier than ever. Mr. Spruce? What are you... Why do you suddenly care so much about the Spruces and their feelings? I don't. I... I don't. [Josh] Seems like you do. No, it's just, you've been here, and I've been gone. I just thought you may have some insight. Just the same old mutual hatred. - Nothing, nothing's changed. - Okay. [Josh] So, uh, what's up with that new guy that works over there? What guy? The guy that... couldn't tie a tree to the roof of a car. Mm. [Julie] What about him? I mean... he's a Spruce, so, probably not the best guy to have a crush on, Julie. - What are you talking about? - [Josh]I... You don't, you don't know what I'm talkin' about? - [Julie] No. - Okay. I mean, yeah, Mr. Spruce and Dad had a run-in at the bakery and things got pretty heated, so... Like I said, Julie, nothing's changed. I just don't like to see Dad upset. Me neither. [tractor engine rumbling] [Rick] Ha-ha! Yee-haw! [Dave] Oh, wow. [laughs] - Oh. - Huh? Unbelievable. - What do you think? - Truly unbelievable. That's quite a stone wall, Uncle Dave. Yeah. I pulled every one of those stones out of this field myself. Except for that one. That's gonna be there till the next Ice Age. So, you like the hayride idea? I love it. Yeah. Customers are gonna like it too. We used to do that till that old tractor died. Can't believe you got it runnin' again. Oh, it just needed a little TLC. You know, it's nice to have you around, Rick. I think this, uh, this might really be the right fit after all. I think so, too. Yup. Makes sense to keep the place in the family, right? You okay, Uncle Dave? Yeah. This farm is my whole life, you know. Why'd you never get married? Start a family? Never in the cards, I guess. Can I ask you about what happened at the coffee shop today? No. Just seems an awful shame to hold such a bitter grudge for such a long time. I mean, they're our neighbors. When can we bury the hatchet? There is no "burying the hatchet." A feud doesn't die till one of us dies with it. That's crazy. You don't know what you're talkin' about, so leave it. Now, this feud has made you push everyone away. When's enough gonna be enough? This is our youngest crop right here. [Dave] Planted that a year ago. Another six years, that'll be ready for harvest. Now, meanwhile, we're gonna plant this new field in the spring. [Holly] And your address is... Okay. Okay, great. All righty, we'll have those over to you soon. Happy holidays! Hey, Dave. We got a delivery order. I'm on it. What've we got? Boys and Girls Club, down in the city. They're holding a raffle, they want 12 trees. - Do we donate 'em? - Nah. We give 'em a good discount. But if we donate 'em, we can write off the entire retail value. It might be better for us come tax time. Plus, you get some pretty nice holiday goodwill. I like the way you think. I've learned a thing or two sellin' used cars, Uncle Dave. Thanks. [giggling] [Holly] Hey. [giggling continues] [creaking] [gasps] Did you hear something? - What? - I don't know. I thought I heard somebody coming. - It's fine. - No. What if it's Dave? What if it is? Well, you can't be here. Why not? Duh. You're... Look, we're not Spruces or Pines, so... The rules kinda don't apply to us. Dave thinks they do. Look, it's not something that we need to worry about. You know, who does need to worry is... Julie and that nephew guy. - What? - Yeah. I saw them at the ball field. What did you see? - What we were just doing. - Ha. My God. - That totally makes sense. - Right? Rick's been asking me all about the feud. - Exactly. - Huh. This could be good. How could this be good? You ever heard of, like, the Hatfields and the McCoys or Romeo and Juliet? They all die. No, because Dave and James used to be friends. - You're kidding. No. - Mm-hm. I found something that proves it. - What'd you find? - A bunch of old photos. - Of? - All of them. Dave, James, Martha... Mrs. Pine. Together, here at the farm. Smiling, laughing. - This is crazy. - I know. Yeah, we need to help them. Them who? Rick and Julie. All right, fine, but not right now. [laughing] [Josh] Get rid your hat. Psst. Jule. I'll be right back. Hey! Have you seen Julie? Oh, sorry, Boss, she, uh, she went into town. Anything I can help you with? Uh, no, no. That's okay. I'll-I'll catch up with her tonight. Thanks. All right. [Julie] Is that... Your mom, your dad and my uncle? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Look how young they were. Where did you get these? Holly, she found 'em stashed in a box in the potting shed. [Julie] So, they were friends. [Rick] Sure looks like it. Do you really think this all blew up because of a fire? I don't know. But I know who might. Are you cold? I don't get cold. Well, you're not in Kansas anymore. Texas. You need to start dressing for a New England winter. - Better? - Thank you. Back for another doughnut? Actually... we were hoping you'd be able to fill in some blanks. I'll make us some cocoa. [Julie] Is that at our house? - It is. - So they were friends? - Best friends. - Really? Thick as thieves. And not just them. Generations of Spruces and Pines. You couldn't find two closer families if they'd been blood. You know, it used to be one big farm back in the day. I didn't know that. After the fire... Dave, your uncle, built that big stone wall and then James let the forest grow up over it to keep each other out. Uncle Dave looks out over that field with such contempt in his eyes. I know. Tears me up inside. Believe me, they were such good friends. Is that you? [Martha gasps] [Martha] Every Christmas... [sighs] ...the two families would take turns decorating a big gorgeous tree in each other's barn. They'd invite friends and neighbors, and... [Martha sighs] [Martha] It was glorious. When the friendship ended, so did the tradition. What happened then? It was something more than the fire. - Has to be. - Of course it was. Why do they hate each other so much? Most feuds don't start as hate. Takes a while to get there. This one... This one started with love. Then heartbreak. My mom? They were both in love with her. But she chose your father. Poor Dave. He never looked at another woman again. Really? [Martha] Yeah. I would know. Martha, I had no idea. I'm sorry. No wonder he never got married. [Martha] Your sweet mom, when she was alive, she really tried to play peacemaker. But... [chuckles] Sometimes I think she was the only reason things didn't just boil over. Now she's gone. Do you think they could ever be friends again? [sighs] Sometimes, time doesn't heal wounds. Sometimes, it leaves them bare. So, you're saying it's impossible? I'm sayin'... you'd need a miracle. But lucky for you, it's Christmas. Plenty of those to go around. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I can't believe my Uncle Dave was in love with your mom. I know, it's crazy. Do you know what this means? We can fix this. I think we should talk to my uncle first. If he kept those photos all these years, that must mean something, right? Uh, "we"? Pretty sure I'm banished from that farm. They probably circulated my pictures to everyone in the staff. They did. I keep mine in my wallet. I think you should come, too. We're a team, right? Okay. [engine rumbling] He might be on the second level. - Wait here, okay? - Okay. Don't touch that. I'm sorry. I thought I told you. You're not welcome here. You did. I just, um... - She's here with me. - Rick. We're together. You're seeing each other? Do you know who she is? - Who her family is? - I do. This feud between our families has gone on far too long. It's gotta stop. No, this has to stop. Uncle Dave, families with generations of friendship between them are unique in this world. [Dave] No, I don't know what you're talkin' about. Friendship like that is worth fighting for. I don't have time for this. Now, if you don't mind, I believe I asked you to leave. James Pine must've been pretty important to you. Otherwise, he wouldn't have kept these. - Where'd you get those? - Does it matter? Ah, that was long ago. Too many years, too much bad blood. Uncle Dave, I know he was your friend. Not anymore. I don't associate with Pines. That's your decision then, but it's not gonna be mine. Oh, really? Even if it means giving up the farm? What? If you continue to be involved with her... then our agreement is over. I can't believe he reacted like that. I can. The feud is older than us. It's not gonna change overnight. What do we do now? [sighs] I don't know. I'll give it up. You can't. Sure I can. Look, if he's gonna put conditions like that on the farm, then I just won't take it. It's you and me, Julie. Look, you can't do that. I've fallen in love with you. Look, I know this, this is happenin' fast but I don't want it to end. Do you? No. So, we won't let it. Julie! Dad... I can explain. - You're Spruce's nephew. - Yes, Sir. I can't believe you would do this to me, Julie. I'm not doing anything to you. - Sir, if I may... - No, you may not. You know how we feel about that family. Rick has nothing to do with it. He is a Spruce. A Spruce is a Spruce. They're all the same. That's not true. - Sir. - What? Whatever my uncle's problem is with your family, it's not mine. I don't know what to say. I thought I had raised a daughter who understood the values this family holds. Dad... Dad! [Julie sighs] I'm sorry, Julie. It's not your fault. I mean, maybe this just wasn't meant to be. How can you say that? After what I just said to you... Don't you feel the same way? I mean, did you see the look in his eyes? It's just too much. So that's it? We just walk away, forget? I don't wanna forget.

Merry Christmas. I miss you. [sniffles] I could really use your help. I don't know what to do, I feel like I have managed to hurt everyone around me. Here you are. [sniffles] [Josh] Hey, Julie, you seen James at all? Whoa. Whoa-whoa. Where you goin'? [Josh] You okay? [sighs] I fell in love with him, Bear. That's awesome. Are you kidding? He's a Spruce. I fell in love with Rick Spruce. I mean... [sighs] All right, look. You're not the only one. What? All right, you can't tell anybody, but you know Holly? - The girl that works... - Yeah. ...on the Spruce Farm with them? - Yeah. - Well, we've been dating. - What? - For, like, three months. - Bear. - Secretly. Nobody knows about it. So, I'm, all I'm saying is look... it can work. It's different, you're not family. [scoffs] Close enough. The difference is, Dad's making me choose. There's no way he's ever gonna let us be together. Yeah. I can see how that would complicate things. But, look... in my opinion, if you love this guy just go for it. Wait, you can help me. Can you get this letter to Holly? Yeah. I was thinking of a way that I could get it to Mr. Spruce but I can't go anywhere near that place right now. Well, what is it? It's a letter from my mom. Yeah. Got the truck back up and runnin', thanks to your nephew. Oh, he's got a real knack for that, doesn't he? [chuckles] Yeah. I've gotta say though... uh, he's lookin' a little blue. Oh, Martha. But he seemed to really perk up around James' girl. [sighs] Dave? You've spent a long time with a broken heart. You really want that for him? No. I would never wish a broken heart on anybody. Ah. Maybe I was too hard on him. I don't know. What do I do? Never too late to talk to an old friend. And stop by the shop sometime. I'll fix you something special. Merry Christmas, Dave. Merry Christmas, Martha. Julie? Julie, you up there? I've been thinking about the other night. Julie? There you are. This wouldn't be the same without you. [Catherine] My dearest James. If you're reading this, it's our first Christmas apart. The highlight of my year was always finding you the perfect gift. But there was only one thing I was never able to give you. And it's my singular regret in life. You may have lost me but you can find your friendship with Dave again. I know how hard it is for you to swallow your pride and take that first step. So, I've made a few arrangements. This is my wish... for Christmas. All my love, Catherine. Can I help you? Looking for a tree. [chuckles] Well, you've come to the right place. You got anything in mind? Not really. Something small, maybe? I've got a taxi waiting for me in the parking lot. I just came from the airport. Wasn't supposed to be home for Christmas. Well, welcome back. You made it in the nick of time with a day to spare. Thanks, I, uh, wanna surprise my fiancée. This was our first year without a tree. Said she didn't feel right celebrating alone. So, I thought I'd bring a little Christmas with me. I have just the thing. Wait right there, I'll be right back. It's perfect. She's gonna love it. What do I owe you? You know what? On the house. [man] Really? Yeah, welcome home. Thanks. It's not really home until I see her, you know? Yeah, I do. Like they say... home isn't where you hang your hat, it's where you hang your heart. Merry Christmas. [Rick] Merry Christmas. - Hey. - Josh! - Hey. - What are you doing here? I need a favor, and it's kind of an important one. You think you can give this to Dave for me? Okay. - What is it? - It's a Christmas card. Kind of a special one, so... - Okay. - Cool. - Go. Go. - Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Sorry. Mom. [sliding door opens] There you are. I've been looking for you all day. I thought you might have left. I wasn't gonna leave you, Dad. Not on Christmas. I'm sorry, Julie. Can you ever forgive me? I finally know what it must've been like for you to meet Mom. [sighs] You found the star. - Yeah. - And the letter? I got one, too. We've one last delivery to make. [James] Oh, really? Who to? One eight-foot blue spruce to Spruce Farm. [James] Your mother. Yeah. I was hoping I might find you here. Great minds. I thought you might have left... and gone back to Texas. I thought about it, long and hard. Then I realized, much as my family is back in Houston... I couldn't leave you behind. I'm sorry about our crazy families. I had an impossible choice to make. I understand. Really, I do. I feel like we really have a chance to make this work though. - Really? - Yeah. You're never gonna believe what I just found. - What? - So... My mom left me these letters before she died... I think there was one around here. How about this one? No, no, that's not, not quite right. Not... It's not the, it's not the blue spruce. I'm looking for an eight-foot blue spruce. - I knew it was around here. - Eight feet? - What'd you say? - It's eight feet? Eight feet. Eight feet. Oh, wait. Here it is. This is the one. - This right here? - Yeah. [James] Right here. All right, Josh, do the honors. Will do, Boss. [Catherine] Dear Dave Merry Christmas. I feel like this ridiculous feud between the Spruces and Pines is all my fault. One can never predict the ways of the heart. I only wish that when I followed mine, it didn't cause yours to break. Please forgive me. But if you can't, please forgive James. With love, friendship and forgiveness, Catherine. [sobbing] - Hello, Dave. - James. I've got one last Christmas Eve delivery to make. So I see. I'm supposed to bring it in and set it up. Decorating included. Catherine. [Dave] Huh. I got one too. Well... go ahead. Do your business. I wouldn't wanna disappoint her. [James] Let's go. All right. [James] You got it, right? [Josh] I got the base. [Josh] Okay. All right. I got this side. Come on. Here we go. Let's, uh, let's get this over with. A little to the left. Perfect. No, wait. That's a little too left. - Okay, stop. - Oh, it's beautiful. Just like I remember it. [Rick] Uncle Dave, Mr. Pine, Julie and I have come here tonight on Christmas Eve in the spirit of forgiveness. Dad, Mr. Spruce, Rick and I wanna be together. But we also respect and love you both. As you know, it was Mom's final Christmas wish for you two to finally make amends once and for all. It would be the greatest gift to all of us... and to Mom. [sighs] I figured she might have one last trick up her sleeve to get us to talk again. I'm sorry, my friend. Forgive me for being such an ass all these years. Done. If you can forgive me for taking your girl. That... I will never forgive. [laughing] [Dave] But it's been worth it because these guys are perfect for each other. [laughing] - I agree. - I agree, too. Martha, we got it. - What? - Our Christmas miracle. [laughing] Yeah. Oh. But you made it happen. Come on, you're missin' all the fun. [sighs] - Go. - Sh. Come on. Come. Shh. It's over, Dad. It is. Thanks to you. Your mother would be happy. Yeah. I never meant to hurt you, Julie. - I just couldn't... - I know. I love you, Dad. Oh, I love you too. I'm glad you stayed. I can't imagine anybody takin' over this place but you. Thanks, Uncle Dave. I'll do you proud, I promise. I know you will. [Dave] How's this look for Santa? [Julie] Perfect. [indistinct chatter] Julie? Do the honors? Leave it to Mom to make a dramatic entrance. [Martha chuckles] [chuckles] [all] Aw. [people cheering] Whoo-ho-hoo-ho. [cheering] Oh. [Martha] Oh. [cheering] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Spruce. Merry Christmas, Mr. Pine. [cheering] [Rick] I just got married!
