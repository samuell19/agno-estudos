COME ON. AAH! AAAH! SEE YA. HA! HAI! HAI! CHINESE NEW YEAR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HOLIDAY OF THE YEAR FOR US. ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, WE HAVE TO PAY OFF ALL OUR DEBTS AND START THE YEAR FRESH. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CLEAN, BECAUSE TODAY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CLEAN ANYTHING. WHY NOT? BECAUSE YOU WOULD SWEEP AWAY ALL YOUR GOOD LUCK FOR THE YEAR. THE DRAGON IS A MOST POWERFUL ANIMAL. HE'S VERY GOOD LUCK. ARE THOSE DOGS? NO. THEY'RE LIONS. YELLOW LIONS ARE THE PEKING. THESE ARE THE CANTONESE. MANY YEARS AGO IN CHINA, A HUGE BEAST WOULD COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE FARMS. HE WOULD EAT ALL THE CROPS AND THEN STEAL AWAY THE CHILDREN. ONE DAY, A LION CAME FROM THE FOREST AND SCARED AWAY THE BEAST. EVER SINCE THEN ON NEW YEAR'S, WE DO THE DANCE OF THE LION-- TO SCARE THE EVIL SPIRITS AWAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR. OH. AND IS THIS A TRUE STORY? YOU'LL SEE THEM NIBBLING ON THE CORNERS OF THE BUILDINGS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE EVIL SPIRITS HIDE. ON THE CORNERS? OF COURSE. AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THE EVIL SPIRITS HIDE IN THE CORNERS? EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. YOU HAVE TO COME TO DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT, AND HAVE A TRADITIONAL NEW YEAR'S DINNER WITH AUNT MEI. I CAN'T DO THAT. I'M NOT READY FOR IT. COME ON. Aunt I'M SORRY FOOD IS NOT SO MUCH. THIS IS A FEAST. OH, NO, IT'S NOT SO MUCH. BUT PLEASE EAT ANYWAY. AUNT MEI KNOWS CHINESE ASTROLOGY. AH, MY UNCLE IS A... . THAT MEANS FORTUNE TELLER. AND WHEN THE CHILDREN IN A FAMILY WANT TO GET MARRIED, WE SEND THEM TO UNCLE. AND HE WILL SAY IS IT OKAY OR NOT. JULIE'S THE YEAR OF THE HORSE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE HORSE IS GOOD. UH, THEY'RE VERY SMART-- STRONG-MINDED. BUT MEN DON'T LIKE TO MARRY A WOMAN THAT IS THAT SMART AND THAT STRONG-MINDED. BUT FOR A MAN THAT IS STRONG-MINDED AND IS A TIGER OR A DRAGON, THEN IT'S OKAY. WHAT YEAR ARE YOU? DON'T YOU KNOW? NO. HE IS A DRAGON. YAAH! HI. HI. WHAT'S THIS? I JUST CAME TO APOLOGIZE. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT. IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, I DO LOVE YOU. I KNOW. WHY DON'T WE GO OUT AND HAVE SOME DINNER AND THEN GO DANCING? NOT TONIGHT. I'M KINDA TIRED. COME ON. WE'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME. THAT'S REALLY SWEET, BUT LET'S DO IT ANOTHER TIME. FINE. YAAH! COME ON, BUD. HEY... HAH! GRANDMA? UH-HUH? HI. I, UM, GOT A PROBLEM. WHAT? I MET A MAN. SO? I THINK I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM. GRAB THAT. DO YOU LOVE CHUCK? I THOUGHT I DID. NOW YOU'RE NOT SURE. WELL, I HAVE BEEN WITH CHUCK SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. RIGHT. HE STILL ACTS LIKE HE'S IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT DO YOU LOVE HIM? I DON'T KNOW. AND THE OTHER MAN? JOHNNY? JOHNNY. DO YOU LOVE HIM? WELL... I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS. WELL... THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT. EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND. ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. THIS IS A PROBLEM. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW YOUR FATHER DIED. WELL, HE'S NOT VIETNAMESE. HE'S FROM CHINA. JULIE, I DON'T CARE, BUT THAT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO BRAD. DOES HE KNOW? NO. WELL, MY ADVICE TO YOU IS NOT TO LET HIM FIND OUT. AND ANOTHER THING-- BEFORE THIS GOES ANY FURTHER, YOU'D BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT CHUCK. YAH! EYAH! I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME TONIGHT. ME, TOO. WELL, IT'S LATE. YEAH... I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW. ME TOO. I BETTER GO. BYE. COME ON! OH! JUST A MINUTE. HOW YOU DOING? FINE, JUST FINE. YOU SURE? YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE. WHAT WAS THAT MUSIC I HEARD? JUST THE RADIO. HOW'S CHUCK? OKAY, I GUESS. SO EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH YOU TWO, RIGHT? SAME OLD, SAME OLD. THAT'S GOOD. ARE YOU READY? ALMOST. WELL, WELL... IT WARMS MY HEART ALL OVER TO SEE RACE RELATIONS IMPROVING IN OUR CITY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? THERE'S A STORM BREWIN' IN THE STREETS. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHERE AND WHEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NO, YOU NEVER DO. WELL, MISS, WHAT DOES YOUR FAMILY THINK OF THIS LITTLE ARRANGEMENT? JUST LEAVE HER OUT OF THIS. AND YOU TELL YOUR COUSIN I'VE HAD IT WITH THE GANG WARS GOIN' ON ON MY STREETS. COME ON. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. SO ARE YOU. HI. HI, CHUCK, HOW'S IT GOIN'? GOOD. JULIE'LL BE OUT IN A SEC. THANKS.

SO, WHAT DO YOU WANNA EAT? I'M NOT HUNGRY. SO WHAT'S WRONG? CHUCK, WE NEED TO TALK. SO TALK. WHAT'S THIS? I NEED MORE TIME. WELL, THE WEDDING'S NOT FOR SEVEN MONTHS. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH TIME? I NEED TIME ALONE. NO... THAT'S NOT TRUE. DON'T YOU LOVE ME? ALL RIGHT, WHO IS IT? CHUCK, PLEASE. IS IT THAT GUY AT THE DANCE? THAT YELLOW PIECE OF SHIT? IS THAT WHO'S BEHIND THIS? HE'S A PERSON, NOT A COLOR. YOU BITCH. HE'S NOT GONNA BE A PERSON MUCH LONGER. YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND TO COME WATCH BRAD TAKE TERRY APART TONIGHT. AND FOR ROUND TWO, I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO "IT'S JUST A SPORT"? THIS ONE ISN'T FOR SPORT. HERE, FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET. HUT, HUT, HUT... YOU BEEN TRAINING PRETTY HARD LATELY. YEP. HARDER THAN USUAL. JUST TRYIN' TO STAY IN SHAPE. I HEAR THERE'S A BIG FIGHT TONIGHT. REALLY? I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. DON'T LIE TO ME. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING? OH! I WANT YOU TO CALL IT OFF. WHAT DO YOU CARE? I'M DATING HIS SISTER. SO? AAH! ALL MY LIFE I'VE BEEN PISSED ON BY THESE ASSHOLES. JUST BECAUSE I'M ASIAN, I GET SHIT ABOUT VIETNAM, I GET SHIT ABOUT JAPAN-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. WELL, TONIGHT'S PAYBACK TIME. YOU CAN FIND HATE EVERYWHERE. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING'S FINDING LOVE. LOVE? I'M IN LOVE WITH HER. WELL, HOW AM I GONNA CALL THE FIGHT OFF? HOW'S IT GONNA LOOK? TO HELL WITH THEM. YOU'RE NOT THE ONE LOSIN' FACE. OKAY... TELL 'EM YOU WANNA FIGHT THE WAY THEY USED TO IN THAILAND. YOU MEAN WITH THE BROKEN GLASS ON THE HANDS? ARE YOU NUTS? LOOK, THIS WAY HE'LL BE THE ONE WHO'S BACKING DOWN. WHAT IF HE DOESN'T? HE'S NOT CRAZY. OKAY. HI. HI. IS ANYBODY HERE? NO. I TALKED TO BRAD-- AND COULDN'T STOP HIM. IT'S TAKEN CARE OF. THEY'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT. WHAT DID YOU DO? I TALKED WITH TERRY. AND HE LISTENED? YEAH. OH, THANK GOD. HOPE YOU MADE OUT YOUR WILL. I'M ONLY GONNA DO THIS ONE WAY. YEAH? WE FIGHT THAI-STYLE-- WITH BROKEN GLASS. LET'S DO IT. SO... HOW'D YOU CONVINCE TERRY NOT TO FIGHT? IN THE OLD DAYS, IN THAILAND, FIGHTERS USED TO FIGHT WITH GLASS ON THEIR FISTS. I TOLD TERRY TO TELL YOUR BROTHER THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE'D FIGHT-- THAT WAY BRAD WOULD BE THE ONE TO BACK DOWN. HE'S CRAZY. HE'LL DO IT. COME ON. NO, I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S INSANE. GIVE ME YOUR KEYS. I'M GOING WITH YOU. THAT'S IT. YEAH! COME ON! GET UP. YEAH, TERRY, THAT'S IT! COME ON, BRAD! BREAK HIS LEG! COME ON! LET'S GO! OH! THAT'S IT. FINISH HIM, BRAD! YAAH! UGH! FINISH HIM! YAAH! NO! YAH! I DON'T WANNA FIGHT YOU, BRAD. COPS! YOU'RE GOIN' TO THE FUNERAL? YEP. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA. I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK ANYMORE. WOULD YOU TELL ME HOW YOU COULD LEAVE CHUCK FOR THAT GOOK? BECAUSE I LOVE HIM, AND I'LL MARRY HIM IF HE WANTS ME. YOU'LL MARRY THAT GUY OVER MY DEAD BODY. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH TROUBLE? YOU KILLED HIS COUSIN! LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM. HE'S THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA. BUT I CAN'T SAY MY HEART'S PUMPIN' PISS WATER 'CAUSE THERE'S ONE LESS SLOPE IN THE WORLD. I'M LEAVING. YOU'RE NOT GOIN' TO THE FUNERAL. BRAD, YOU ARE NOT MY KEEPER. YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

HE'LL GO TO TRIAL. YEAH, AND GET PROBATION. LOOK, I'M DOING-- I DON'T CARE! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS? NOPE. WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM? WHAT FOR? BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM. I HATE HIM. THE OPPOSITE OF LOVE IS NOT HATE. OH, REALLY? WELL, WHAT IS? APATHY. WELL, THAT'S ME. I COULDN'T CARE LESS. THEN, UH, YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF I TOOK THIS? NO. GO RIGHT AHEAD. EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING SO, BUT THERE'S ONE THING CONSISTENT WITH BOTH OUR CULTURES. WHAT'S THAT? WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN, MEN ARE STUPID. THEY CERTAINLY BAFFLE ME. ARE YOU AFRAID TO WORK? TO STRUGGLE, TO PERSIST? MRS. MARSHALL... I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET OUT OF CHINA. OR TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE AND GET THROUGH MED SCHOOL.
