Look at all the mess. - And now what do you want? - I come because of your brother. I told you I don't want anything to do with him. He just wants to apologize - He regrets what he did to you. - So why isn't he here? Why doesn't he come and tell me himself? I'm going to bathe him every few days and bring him food. I helped him up to walk a few steps, but he is getting worse. Even for that, you should go see him. Whatever happens to him, I don't care. Anger and resentment never bring anything good. You should drop it. It is easier even for you. If he wants to see me, he should come here. If not, whatever. Think wisely. Do not be the one who later regrets.
