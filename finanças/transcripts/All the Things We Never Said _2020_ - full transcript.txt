I'd turn around to find her there Like a flower in bloom in summer So beautiful that she wasn't for touching Bathed in sunlight after a rain shower Glistening and swaying All the Things We Never Said Okay, next one. Or you could say: It's strange. English makes me open up. Eight years after the Tohoku Earthquake, The Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Plant still generates contaminated water... The nuke plant again? What now? Radiation or whatever, we can't do anything about it, can we? I wanna know what this news reader expects us to do. They just talk down to us. Want an ice pop? Sweets don't go with booze. I'm drunk. Raising a kid is hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. My life Is just stress and getting fatter. You're having fun chasing a dream. Sound fair to you. I hate that I'm dreading it. Your family's weird, Atsuhisa. Hey, wasn't your loser dad a big shot once? Is your big brother still a shut-in? Your family's a total disaster. Fall near a grave, you die. You'll die. What's Obon? When ancestors' spirits return each year. If only they'd leave us alone. It's so weak I can barely taste it. Everything about you is dull. Toru. How's things? I hear you quit another job. It's Obon. I keep thinking about Grandad. It's been 11 years already? Since he died. We owe so much to him, but... It's like... ...it's hard to tell if he existed. He did... ...didn't he? Well... When you and I die, we'll probably be forgotten too. It'll be hard to tell whether we existed or not either. So Toru, don't sweat the small stuff, and take it easy. Suzu. Daddy, why do cicadas chirp? I'm a fox! Not a fox, a dog. So that's it... You want a dog? I didn't say that. Let's sleep. I'm feeling a little dizzy. Might be a cold. Oh yeah? You can take off early. No.. I'm sorry. Daddy? Whoops! Here, eat this too. Please, don't give Suzu your cold. I never felt like you loved me. I was hurting all this time. I doubt you'll be able to understand how I feel, but I was hurting. For five years. Always. Always? Yes. Always. Before we got together... ...you were engaged to a woman named Sachiko, remember? Atsuhisa... You broke it off to be with me. When you did, I betrayed Sachiko. I hurt her, and hurt her deeply. I was so stupid. I've realized that. I wonder what she's doing now? That poor girl... Why bring that up? I'll raise Suzu myself. Money's up to you. We'll discuss how much I'll need sometime down the line, okay? We need time to decide. Also... I feel bad about this, but Suzu needs her preschool... ...so I want to stay here. Get what I mean? Say something. Say I've got it all wrong. I get everything. But what I don't get... ...is whether Granddad existed or not. Okay, try it on. Looks great! Drop the act. No need to lie. A house with a garden? That was no lie. It's my true dream. So is us starting a company. Can't change dreams easily. Yeah? Yeah. You okay? I'm okay. We went to Chiba. Got those cookie things. It was great! We went to a farm. Suzu rode a horse. Natsumi. You're shameless. What do you know? Well? What made you say that? Ignorantly blaming me is shameless. If Atsuhisa is going around acting like a victim, he's shameless. But he isn't. Of course not. Know how much I've suffered these last five years? I doubt it. He tried to give you a comfortable life. And... when you needed him, he ended his engagement to save you. Yeah, so? "So"? So, that's sad. I didn't want him to save me. I only wanted his love. When we talked divorce, he just looked away from me. He never looked at me. That was how we were, you know? So when it comes down to it, what should I have done? Maybe... ...I should've married you instead. That's not funny. But, I loved you. Through high school. Don't say that. Please. That Sachiko, who Atsuhisa was engaged to... She was at my home. I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Sorry to just turn up like this. I'm Sachiko Iimura. I knew it'd offend you, and aggravate you... ...but I couldn't help coming here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Over and over. Then Atsuhisa changed. I knew I shouldn't have married him. Even so... ...back then, I was pregnant with Suzu, so I had to try. But I failed. More's the pity. I'm not the one Atsuhisa loved. So for these five years, I devoted myself to Suzu. But now, there's someone I love. Once I fall in love with someone, I don't ever deny it. If you think that's wrong, too bad. I can't live a life as unfair as this. I need to be a woman. I really did love Atsuhisa... ...but now, I can be a woman again. Leave me out of this. Keep it to yourselves. Quit wasting my time. I didn't mean that. Call if you need me. Want to help? Let's make something nice for Mommy. Okay? One day, AI will become so advanced, I think we'll be out of a job. Paper books will go first. I don't have time for this, but I'll ask as a friend. Why break up with Natsumi? You lonely? Did you cry? Aren't you angry? Why not? Don't you miss Suzu? Either way, I shouldn't say. I want to. But if I try, for some reason, the words don't come out. Because I'm Japanese? I'm crying on the inside. But on the outside, no tears come out. It doesn't matter. It'll all fade away one day. I'm on your side, but... ...was it your fault? Yeah How's that? ...let her down. Time to head home. I don't want to. Looks like Natsumi's. She came. Oh... Got it. Hey... This goes for both of us, but your feet have gotten stinkier. Forget that, you suspect me. Can I turn the light on? Can't see your face. I'd turn around to find her there Like a flower in bloom in summer So beautiful that she wasn't for touching Bathed in sunlight after a rain shower Glistening and swaying I want to see your face. Light from the TV will do. Mes fans in Japon, bonjour! We're your watchers transcending time and space. Les Romanesques. This country was once home to samurai. Loads of them. But not anymore. They went to war, lost, built an economy, got cocky, their bubble burst, and they were deflated A bunch of stuff happened, and here we are, Les Romanesques. That goes for all of you out there too. Tomorrow, February 5th, we'll be performing live... Tomorrow. Let's go. No money. Forget money. I'll pay. I'm not in the mood for music. I am a samurai dandy A samurai dandy dandy dandy I am where I always am awaiting my lord's return I am a samurai dandy A samurai dandy dandy dandy My lord is late tonight In a pillar's shadow I wait Don't touch, don't woo, don't lock eyes Don't speak, don't startle Just follow behind Loneliness but happiness Writing chalk on a street, "I want you" I hate you, I hate you but I'll await you again tomorrow Six months later More shifts? Yes. You poor single mothers. Nothing left after rent? No. I'll go pick up Suzu. Screw that. Spit it out already. We can't get by on my part-time pay. Get money from your ex. Or, don't be so picky about the kind of job you do. Call girls... make a whole lot of cash. I know people. The pay's good because of the risk. Some freaks use needles on girls. I could easily be a call girl. For my daughter and the guy I love, I could. I'm not with you for nothing. I've got nowhere else to go. Get this straight. I won't let you leave me. I'm ready for the worst. I've got to be. Just a little will do. I need you to transfer it. Thanks. Any ideas for Suzu's birthday? Just transfer some money. But... don't go overboard. Alright. Okay... Thank you. Hey... What? Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Natsumi... Toru... Natsumi and I divorced last year. That's why you came alone? Why not say so? What are you going to do? I never liked that girl. From the start. It's her fault, isn't it? Did she walk out with Suzu? Hey, let's buy beer and drink with Atsuhisa tonight. He left this morning. Huh? Come on, you're his father. You should pay more attention to him. His divorce was news to you too. Because he didn't tell me. Is that marijuana?! It is, isn't it?! Stop it! You've caused enough problems for this family! It'll be prison next time! Idiot! Stop smoking dope and find a job! Stop smoking dope! Stop smoking dope! What would you like? Cucumber and salmon? I've been thinking. Let's move house. For a fresh start. Yeah. How was work? Tough? My feet hurt. My back does too from all the bowing. Hang in there. It's your first day. Don't quit this one. He looks good in a suit, right? I do? Cool? A call girl has been murdered at a hotel in Shinjuku's Kabukicho. This is the second call girl murder in Kabukicho this year... Seaweed. Suzu! You want soda, right? Fizzy drink. Take care. Suzu, are you still hungry? Shall I cook some more rice? What? What the fuck?! What the fuck?! What?! What do you want? Shit. It's good. Six months later Stupid boy. Such a stupid boy. When we visited Toru, he said, "I'm going to quit dope." This is actually good. It's good. That reminds me. I brought this along. It's about time we took a family photo again. Excuse me, would you mind? Us three. Is this right? Um... I don't know... A real idiot. Only the dumb ones live long. The prison's there. Let's take a photo here. Would you mind? Just point and shoot. Get that building too. Smile! Smile, smile! He was a good guy. But still, did you know he owed us money? I lent it 'cause I liked him. Want to see the IOU? Your name's on it as guarantor. Different surnames. You weren't married? So that's why there's no altar. I feel a little bad for the guy. Like he's been forgotten. Anyway, it's only 3 or 4 million yen. That's all. I remember signing things without checking what they were. I had no choice. But, I'll take a look. At the IOU. I want to know if I'm truly liable. I'll check it one last time. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... "I'm aching, inside." Remember when I'd say that? I asked a doctor about it. It's a problem with my womb. Apparently, I was never able to have a child. Maybe it's good we broke up. I envy you. I wanted a girl too... Be good to her. Don't. Don't cry. I'm sorry. Natsumi's important to me. I know, but don't say it so bluntly. You don't love me. That's why you can be honest with me. I know. Okay, see you. I'll come for you soon. Let's get through this. I'm back. Satomi, your usual in Kabukicho please. Options selected: sailor suit costume, spit swapping. Not him again... Have things ever ended up getting dangerous? I guess so, but there's nothing we can do about it. You just gotta block it out. How else can we live? Only dumbasses try to fight it. Six months later It's so hot. I need a shower bad. I'll go first. You're hard to watch. You're just humiliating yourself. Pathetic. Pathetic. If I don't think about it, it doesn't seem so bad. That's all. Pathetic. Hold on a second. Which one? Can we talk? Heard about last night? I thought you might know something. Your wife died. Well, your ex-wife. You didn't know? She was murdered. You've got some nerve. Letting her marry you was a huge mistake. Enough of this. Please, leave us alone! I wish she'd never met you either. It was all wrong. As for Suzu... Please forget her. You okay? I want to go... to the love hotel. Did she really exist? Natsumi. She always had two. The leftovers. Without fail. So, she existed. "I can't cry because I'm Japanese"? Did you love Natsumi? Or were you just unable to forget Sachiko? I can say it in English. Very much. Still. Always. But my love... wasn't good enough. Why? After what she did to you? Because I met her... ...I betrayed people... ...but... I couldn't help it. Because I met her. Good. This takes me back. Around here? Slow down. She's there. Just drive. Drive. You sure? Suzu's better off there. They've got a garden... and a dog. No. I've got to go. Can you? What? I'll Just tell her. "You're... what I treasure most." "I want to live with you." But... ...I won't be able to say it! All my life... ...I've never... ...been able to say what I feel! Let It out! Let it out! Everything! Tell her. Tell Suzu you want to live with her! The truth... ...won't change anything! Maybe, but tell her anyway! Or why did we come? Just to drive?! Quit wasting my time! Stop it! Stop it! I'll be watching you! Tell her what's in your heart. No matter what, tell her! You've gotta be honest with her. I'm your friend, dammit. Listen to me. I'm going! Go for it. I'll be watching you! I can't... I'm sorry, I can't. I can't watch...
