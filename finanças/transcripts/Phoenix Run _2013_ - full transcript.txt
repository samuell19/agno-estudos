I don't got a son named Marky. Marky moved to the fancy part of town two years ago and never came back. Marky said he don't need no family Ma there are people after me. Just get in here. And don't touch any of my shit. Marky I mean it. My superhero days may be over but I can still make your mind explode with just a thought. Thanks Ma. I missed you. Don't give me that bullshit. You in trouble. No It's not like that. Well you've either gone active or you're here to rob me. Either way. That shits made you paranoid. Shit is the only thing stopping those Nanos from burning a hole through my cortex. Besides a little paranoia is worth your discomfort. Think I've got some coffee left. I could put on. Got that Omni processor working again. So we've got hot water and power most of the time. No, uhhh... sorry I can't stay long. I just came to check up on you. Oh, God. Jesus. Alright. Um listen I understand that I haven't visited that I have not kept in touch but I've been working very hard for you. I'm important now. I'm trying to be. I'm on the cusp of something huge and it's gonna bring a lot of attention on me. I do not want that attention on you. I do not want that attention on the kids. And that's why you haven't got it. I need a fuckin minute to make sure that this works out my way. I am so sorry that I have not visited. I love you. Fuck you. I I'm trying my best to be a good son and I'm trying my best to do good work for you. I brought some meds for you and the kids. You've been trying to charm me since the day I met you boy. Has it ever worked. Uh once or twice. You think you can waltz in here with this sweet smile. And a few trinkets. And I forget what you said to me. How many times are we going to go through this Marky. I was hoping a couple of years are hard living would kill that snake inside your soul. Ma, I'm sorry. If I could take back what, I said I would take back what I said. Because I think about it every day. I hope you have. Because every morning I wake up and I think about that little boy that I pulled from a pile of bodies. Telling me I never loved you. That memory is burned inside my soul boy and I am not a woman who easily forgives. Well the meds will help. The kids need em. Mom, look in your eye. You just never know when to shut the hell up. It's been harder getting the treatments this far from the city It's ok children. It's just Marky. Coming to pay a visit. Marky!. Hi. Oh. Hi Iris. Hello you big giant hug monster. Hi Jazz. Hi Jay. Ma says you're a shithead now. Uh oh What's a shithead Marky. Ha ha ha ha. Yes I'm in the shithead virus. Guys I need you go play because I got to keep talking to mom for another minute okay. I know that I can never take back what I said to you and I know that maybe you're going to hate me forever. But I'm just trying to do what you taught me. I'm just trying to survive. Easy. Easy. Easy now. You brought this mess down on my babies. Come on. Come on. Where's the rat. I'm gonna give you about three seconds To get the fuck off my property. We just need Marky and we'll be on our way. You see my two friends here haven't had treatment in months. They're just dying for a taste of that fresh chow. Three. My mother used to tell me that no situation was impossible. For a man wise to opportunity. She taught me that every problem had a simple solution. If you set aside your emotion long enough to find it. She said that we had to stick together to survive in a world this mean. Well look where that got her. I guess you can't be right. All the time.
