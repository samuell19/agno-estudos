Why are you here so late at night? what happened to you? Who are these two women with you? Who are you calling a woman? I am Masud. Mother F*cker! Where is my money? Where are you keeping the money? Hey son of a bitch, where is my money? What money, Masud? What money? Manager, where is my money? Where is my money? I am telling you, brother. I am telling you. Don't beat me anymore. You made friends with me. Thinking me a fool, you were getting all the information about the bank from me. I was a bit suspicious then. Let's have a drink. Let's go. Why don't you let me into your house? Do you have a wife in the house? Yes. I have a new wife. Go and see for yourself. I sleep with my wife every day. It's a crap cigarette. Come on, smoke expensive cigarettes. I went to your house because of that suspicion. I made a fake key for the lock of your room. When I entered the room I found a tunnel on the floor. - Assalamu Alaikum, Sir. - Walaikum Assalam. Sir, I have a friend. His name is Masud. I entered his house. I saw that he is digging a tunnel. Let him dig the tunnel, no problem. But the problem is that I found a map next to the tunnel. A straight line went through the map and ended under our bank vault. His house is just four or five buildings away from our bank. I'm sure he'll get into the vault and steal all the money in the bank. Sir, we will all be in danger. Inform the police. I didn't hear anything. You didn't see anything either. What do you mean, sir? You will help him from now on. But he should not notice. OK, sir. Sir, the work has progressed a lot. I understand sir. That means, we cannot involve ourselves in this work in any way. Manager, where is my money? Oh money! I am yours. You are mine. Shahadat, hurry up! Oh money! you are mine! Where is the money? Tell me? where did you keep it? I have it. Where did you keep it? Sir, tell him everything. Otherwise he will kill us. The dog has gone mad, sir. Tell him, sir. Life is worth more than money. Son of a bitch. Here it is. Oh! So, you kept the money here? Son of a bitch! We are going to a place where no one can find us. No one can guess where we're going to hide. Oh my god! Can you see how much money we have here? Yes. All this money belongs to us? Not us, yours! Where will we keep the money? I won’t be able to sleep because of the tension. I am not getting sleep either. Let’s keep the money in the bank. We stole it from the bank. Won't we get caught. Then, let's take this money and go abroad. I am thinking of setting up a bank in your name. The name of that bank will be "Moyna Trust Bank". In my name? But where? Here. I will dig a tunnel here and build the bank. No no! Don't do this again. Don't dig tunnels anymore. No no! Trust me. This will be the last tunnel of my life. Then we will keep all the money in there? - Yes. - You and me? OK. Common people are suspecting that Masud has fled the country. The police have yet to find any trace of him. There is no way for him to cross the border. However, if he has somehow crossed the border, we will arrest him with the help of Interpol if necessary. Throw softly. - Is there anymore? - No. Oh Allah! Are you still fixing the walls? You like the bank? It’s great! Hmm, Great! Moyna. Yes? I'm scared. Why? The way the police are looking for me, what if they find me in Bandarban? I mean, what if they find me here? Then we will loose everything. Then the police will take away all our money. No! Your money cannot be given to the police. I'm wondering one thing. Suppose I have been jailed for 14 years. I'll go surrender myself. Then? You will stay here. Whenever you need money, you can take the money from the bank and spend it. And in this place, you will spend a lot of money to build a huge building. Then I will come back and rule here. I will be the king and you will be my queen. Oh, Allah. What happened to this? Didn't I tell you then? This light disturbs like this every now and then - Let me see. - Please fix it. - I need the ladder. - Why are you taking it? - I need it to fix the switchboard. - Oh, okay. Take it then. - Oh Moyna, - What? - I forgot to tell you one thing. - what Didn't you have a husband named Zahir? I killed him after getting out of jail. What? Son of a bitch! Dead. Yes, Zahir is no more. He is gone, finished! Buddy, please forgive me? Ah! I forgave you. Yeah it's forgiveness. Here is my forgiveness! Here it is. Take it. Take it. I have forgiven you. Take it.

Can you pick me up from here, please? - Hey! - What are you pouring here? I'm pouring… - What? I don't understand. - Don’t you know what this is? It’s Petrol! Why are you pouring petrol? Have you gone mad? Please, get me out of here. Why are you scared? Why should I get you out of there? Hey Moyna? Masud's Moyna! What does Masud’s Moyna love most? Does she love Masud? No! Masud is a fool. Masud is an idiot. - Masud's Moyna loves money. - No no no! Look, your Masud has brought you money. Look! - Look! how much money Masud brought. Look! - No, I don't need money. You will sleep on this money. When you are hungry, you will eat money. - Masud! - There is no room for cheaters. - Cheaters have no place in my life. - Masud, forgive me. Don’t you love me? Please, forgive me. - Hey! I don't need money. Didn't I tell you that I have changed? I am truly cleansed. Please believe me! Please, don't get it wrong! I'm releasing you. I'll stay however you keep me. - I'm setting you free! I am forgiving you. - Why are you closing it? Please, open it. - Please, forgive me Masud. - Yes. I have forgiven you. I have become a better person now. I will never cheat on you again. Yes. I'm forgiving you. - Masud, please don't kill me. I am feeling scared. Please, Get me out of here. Why are you doing this?
