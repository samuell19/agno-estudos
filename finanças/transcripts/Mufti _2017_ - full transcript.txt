'The reason for every war is selfishness and the end is history.' Move from there! Come on move! Okay, sir! Yes, sir! Fast! Come on, officer! Come on, fast! Quick! Fast! Come on move! Move the car, fast! Move! Move fast! Drive faster! Fast! Darn it! Are we live? People even fear to come here. How dare you shoot live! I'm not a teacher but I still teach a lesson to everyone. We lost three lives yet again. To nab that demon, we must go in disguise. 'NNR party which lost the previous elections with close margin is all set to form government this time by winning the elections with huge margin with immense. hard work and the support of the other parties.' Raghuveer Bhandri, party state president has confirmed that Mr. Gurukanth Bhandri, who has been chosen for Chief Minister's post will take oath in the presence of the governor on 29th of this month. Tiwari has barged in. Tiwari has barged into the port. They were thrashed to pulp but nobody came to the rescue. Hey! Find out the size of the fish then hack them to pieces, it will be easy for them to feed upon them. Boss, don't stress and send the ship, I will get the stuff. From now on, this port belongs to us. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? What happened? Aren't you strong enough to fight him? Get him! The one who gets thrashed by me can never recover, he will be a dead meat. Except you, none of your men are alive to find out the size of the fish. The consignment will arrive at Panambur railway station. We need to be very careful. It's quite risky. Everyone knows that the train reaches the track at Panambur but very few people know that it can also cause deaths of many. Don't think the place is clean, the waves clean the bloodshed that we create. 'Bhairathi Ranagalu's right-hand man Eknath Nimbalkar, the member of parliament died in a major road accident while travelling from Koira to Ronapur.' 'The members of all the parties are condoling the death.' Based on your capacity I'm planning to send you to my place Ronapur. To go to Ronapur you have to first work in Mangalore port. It is the main import and export point for all the illegal business run by him. Sir. I'm going to Ronapur. We have been waiting for this situation from the two years. Bhairathi Ranagalu is a demon in the form of human. He makes his own rules. From a clerk to class one officer, if they bow down to him the entire government comes under his control. We can't deal with him politically. without evidence and proof, we cannot even take action against him. We have already lost several policemen trying to capture him. We should not miss this opportunity. No one should know that you're a cop, not even the air you breath should know. UNCLEAR They are our people. They are here to finish someone. Pistol. Gana. I know. Sena has already told a lot about you. There is a huge difference between the sound of waves at the port and the sound of bullets of Ronapur. It is your loyalty that matters here not guts. You will gradually find out. There are several companies like this. This is cement plant, its wastage itself fetches millions. Several people work under Bhairathi Ranagalu but this place is under Kashi's control. Oh no! Your father and your elder brother are in those barrels. If you tell me in which two barrels they are correctly I will spare them. I will spare them. But if you are wrong... Your brother first. Son guilty for father's Death. I'm giving you another chance. Save your brother. Well-done! He saved his brother. Very good. Hey! You're saved your brother. Lucky fellow. The little brother saved his elder brother but the elder brother has to save the little brother, isn't it? Your little brother saved your life but you failed to save his, you don't deserve to be alive. He is Gana, he's from port area. This is your room. You do not need to buy anything, you have everything here. There's even canteen at the vicinity. You get both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food there. There was a man staying in this room, it's been three months since we bid farewell to him, we killed him. Hello, sir. Due to the faith of the people of Karnataka our party won the election by receiving maximum votes. On this occasion... Greetings. - Greetings. Have a seat. Excuse me, sir. No candidate has ever dared to contest elections against you in Ronapur. Do you have plans to nominate anyone at least in the upcoming by-election? Now is not the right time to answer. Eknath Nimbalkar was a good man, All of us are saddened by his death. On behalf of our party I express condolence. We are yet to decide on that. I will discuss about it with the party leaders and let you know. A police officer in Ronapur will support you. He will provide you with everything you need. Both of you won't know each other but the work will go on. Lighter. Thank you. I think he is following me. I will teach him. I will teach him. Hello. You have been following me. What do you think of yourself? You think you can trick me with your decent looks? I have dealt with thieves like you. Don't mess with me. Stop staring at me. Get going. I will call the police if you don't get going now. Our packages are exchanged. Oh no. Thank you. You have a wonderful voice. Throw the ball. Throw the ball. Who are you? Who do you want? Do you know him? He is a cop. A cop? I wanted him to become a policeman but he became something else. He became a hooligan. The efforts we put in to raise him went in vain. I don't know where he is. If you get to know about his whereabouts, don't tell me. I don't wish to even see his face. Yeah, Bindu. The model broke her leg in an accident. - What? The shooting has been canceled. Oh no. Darn it. - What happened? The ad shoot got canceled. So why do you get so upset? The shooting will be postponed. A set has been put up at my friend's site for a reality show. A person named James Jackson is the director, he's haughty-natured. I heard he's an expert in making reality shows. The shooting is expected to start next week, if she's interested, ask her to approach him, I will talk to him. James Jackson? James Jackson. My God! No! I beg to you! Let me go! Hey. - Yes. The quality of the sandal is very good. What is the brand of the sandal? The name of the brand is Chamatkar. The sandal is durable. When his thoughts itself are so silly, I wonder who silly he would be. The date for the by-election has been fixed but we are yet to decide on our candidate. Nobody from our party is mustering courage to contest elections against him. You shouldn't stop because there's no way. If you keep walking the way will get created on its own. Summon Pashupathy. Nanjundi! Shall we try to lit cigarette with firecracker? Go on, it's Dipawali. What do you think you are doing? Sir, you're contesting MP elections for the first time, let's celebrate. Light the firecracker. Don't you have common sense that people around will get disturbed if you burst firecrackers? Don't you have common sense that people around will get disturbed if you burst firecrackers? Please come, sir. Let's celebrate Dipawali together. Come on! Well-done! It's a full HD TV. Picture quality is fantastic. You don't know what we are capable of. I don't care, I will file nomination. One doesn't need to be in power to get rich. But to build a family one needs a son. Decide soon whether you want power or family? Our very first move went in vain. We are no match to Bhairathi Ranagalu. Let's try Ashwath Kudari, Bhairathi Ranagalu won't interfere in our business. He is foreign returned, he always works for the betterment of the people. He hates politics. A couple of parties had already approached him but they were disappointed. If we managed to convince him we can come to power in Ronapur. But who will convince him? When a snake charmer can tame a poison snake just to make money, but Ashwath Kudari is a good man, let's do everything possible to get him into our party. My God! Hello. That day, the fault was mine, what about today? Do you come reverse with the same speed? Get down and see the damage you have created. Get down and see. Darn it. What happened? There's thunderstorm in Chennai and there's heavy rainfall along with lightening in Ronapur. It's just a minor accident. What? A minor accident? Take a look. The bumper guard is damaged, there are scratches on the handgrip, the number plate is broken and the mirror too. The scooter was gifted to my sister by my brother-in-law. I am answerable to them. The one who allotted driving license to you should be held responsible. Pistol, send the scooter to the garage. Should I stay on the street until the scooter gets fixed? I have an appointment. My programs for today is ruined. You have a wonderful voice but I suggest you to show patience. Look over there. Come, I will drop you. What about my scooter? Ma'am, we will get it fixed, please go. Greetings. - Greetings. I am Raghuveer Bhandri. - I know. You're Gurukanth Bhandri's elder brother. Sit down. Tell me. How can I help you? I watch your programs on television, I read about the protests staged by you in newspaper. Seeing your love towards nature and affection towards people I feel really proud. You call it love and affection but I think it's my duty. What brings you here? You must be aware of the upcoming elections in Ronapur. When you stage a protest thousands of people support you, that's because people have faith in your leadership. You're well-wisher of the people, why don't you join politics? Buttermilk. Please don't get me wrong. I am not interested in politics. You can consider joining politics at least for the people. I guess you've not known about me. And if you did, you wouldn't come this far. You may go. Our party will always be ready to support your cause. Sir, take a look. Excuse me. Can I have your mobile phone? I will collect my scooter tomorrow. Thanks. - The preparations are underway. Come on. If you find beautiful girls, share my number with them. Why is he standing in position already? His name is Nagappa. I see. But why is he bending down? How many children do you have? I have five children. How many children would he begot if he could stand straight? Great. Look Nagappa, this is not a village drama to play a role and gain rewards and appreciations by the people of the village. It's a reality show James Jackson. You must answer all my questions very confidently, okay? Look, you... - Sir. What? A girl is here to meet you. Is it Samantha or Shruti Haasan? Are you Hrithik Roshan for them to come looking for you? I am not Hrithik Roshan, I am Jackson. Hi. - Hi. I touched her. I am sorry, this show is for old people. I will send an e-mail to you when I am making show for women. I am not here to seek a role. Then? I'm here to seek a chance to work as your assistant director. I must not miss the opportunity. She has dug her own grave. You read my mind at once. Excuse me. What's your name? Raksha. - Raksha. We must not discuss anything professional or personal in public. Meet me in my caravan after a couple of minutes. If we go together, there will be a gossip. Get makeup kit to the caravan after 15 minutes. There will be lipstick marks all over my face. She's beautiful. "No matter who yells..." Sir, Sena sent him here. He is Shabari, boss's right-hand. Since he has come here there will be something important. Boss said Singa will take the truck and come there. You should not miss the consignment at any cost. The job should be done carefully before 2 AM. Do you understand? So far, you might have seen trucks carrying iron ore but you will see something else today. Who is he? He's Gana, he's from the port area. Along with other goods, our consignment is coming in the seventh wagon. The seventh wagon will stop at this place from the stopping point of the train. We must unload the consignment quickly and load it in this truck. All of you be alert at the railway station. The information has been leaked, the police are alert at the railway station. Get out from there before the police arrives. How can we let go so much money? Never mind. Come back. It's boss's order. The information has been leaked to the police, we are asked to go back empty handed. Something like this has happened for the first time. How will I confront boss? There is a chance. What's that? If we stop the train in the previous point, we can unload the material. The train won't stop at that point. What if you stop it? Stop the train somehow. - The train has already passed. Darn it! The train has already passed. Since the stations are limited the speed of the train will be limited too. So let's unload the material from the moving train. Kashi, follow him. You instructed us to follow him but he escaped. Let's do what boss said, let's go back. Gana, no! You are taking risk! Come back! There's police at the railway station. Come back, Gana! Listen to me! Gana, come back! Gana, no! Come back! Gana, no! Hello. Sir, I called you several times, you didn't answer my calls. Did you plan to cheat me? You planned to take away my scooter just for offering me a ride? In which shop did you sell my scooter parts? Did you collect the money? Does the jeep belong to you or did you steal even that? Wait a minute, you will see sense if I complained to the police. Hello, I have sent your scooter to your house last evening. What are you saying? You're lying to me? You are not my neighbor nor I printed my address on the scooter. Every vehicle has registration certificate which contains the address of the owner. Tell me. Sister, did anyone get our scooter home yesterday? Oh, I forgot to tell you. I received it yesterday. My friend Pooja has borrowed the scooter, she'll be back any moment. Where are you? Okay, I call you later. Bye. Hello. One second. I'm sorry. Please. Girls are habitual to suspecting and insulting. That's why I am apologizing to you. Sorry. Please. It's okay. Pappu, give me Dosa. Hey! Get Dosa. Sir, Dosa. Wait. Hello. Kashi, Hold on. Shabari wants to speak with you. Yes. Give the phone to Gana. Yes. Come to Sayed Ali junkyard. Singa and I will be there. - Okay, sir. Sir. Get hot Dosa. The knife is valued only if it is sharp, the gun is valued only if it has bullet in it but the man who has guts is valued until he is alive. The boys are amazed seeing the risk you took for the consignment last night. I had a desire to meet with boss. You are very lucky. Our men would've talked about you to boss today, it's because of the risk you took. It's been 5 to 6 years since I joined the gang but only a couple of times I was lucky to see him. That's all. If Singa is close to boss because he's been working for him faithfully for 15 years now. And as long as Shabari is concerned, I've never seen him visit his family. You'll be shocked to see boss's house, it has tight security. The bungalow, the cars, the splendor, they are breathtaking. Many people still don't know about boss's room. Except him, nobody else has entered his room. From his chair to his cot, everything is made of gold. Many say he is living like the ancient kings. Even I wish to see his room once. Looks like you've pen down everything that I said. Don't mention my name. Otherwise I will be finished. You were writing all this time but I don't see anything. Even the pen won't support if you have to write about boss. I will take leave. Bye. Good night. Sir, people even fear to raise their voices against Bhairathi Ranagalu whereas you are staging protest against him by blocking his trucks. Everyone is aware of it. The number of trucks have been increasing from the mining day by day, illegal roads are being built. This has affected the farmers and the environment as well. Greenery is being destroyed by the dust, accident rate is increasing. We complained against it to the concerned departments but to vain. Bhairathi Ranagalu is responsible for all these incidents. We won't stop protesting until the movements of the trucks are stopped. Stop illegal mining! He is protesting against us, I will kill him with the same truck. Stop illegal mining! Stop illegal mining! You know very well that we can do anything we want in Ronapur... Stop illegal mining! Greetings! - Stop illegal mining! We can't mess with Ashwath Kudari. Your protest will bear no fruit. Your voice can cross the dust but it won't reach even to the gates of Bhairathi Ranagalu. Should our trucks be on the road until he calls off the protest? For the power that he has he will transport them even by digging tunnels. Boss himself has to take a decision in this regard. My God! My God! - We are ruined! My God! Even a good leader like you couldn't make any difference to these people. What's the reason? My God! - My God! My God! These placards won't help to stop him. You must have power. At least for the people you have to join politics. My God! Our huts got destroyed! Our huts got destroyed! Okay. My God! You people will be ruined! You will go to hell! You will never prosper! You will be punished! You will be punished! You will be ruined! You will be ruined! They have set the houses in Lakshmipura on fire because people are supporting us. She's boss's little sister Vedhavathi. Don't know what the reason is, it's been years since boss and his sister have spoken to each other. Not only boss she also hates his men. Hence security guards follow her without her knowledge. There's a beautiful girl coming this way. Why did I run out of gas at this odd hour? She is stunning. If you cooperate I will take a selfie. Not just selfie, let's together shoot a video with her. I'll operate the camera. There you go. Even her boyfriend is here. You are her boyfriend, right? You are her boyfriend, right? You said it right though you're drunk. Please excuse me. Why do you go around alone all the time? You out alone during odd hour, who do you think you are? Find a handsome guy and profess your love to him, he will rescue you at times like these. We are ready, profess your love to us. You shouldn't act smart after you grow up because you were vaccinated in childhood. You don't have to be infected with disease to get bedridden. Thanks for your suggestion. I have now decided not to go around alone because a strong guy is right before me. I love you! You must always be with me. His dress is soiled. Hey! Give him another dress. Speak. Who told you about the consignment in the train? 'A police officer will support you in Ronapur.' 'Both of you won't know each other.' It was he who leaked the information about the consignment in the train. Kill him! Go on! 'No one should know that you're a cop, not even the air you breath should know.' We thought Eknath Nimbalkar died in an accident but it was a murder. Those involved have been arrested. That's why boss is coming to the mining area. Ocean all around and forest in the middle. A man who lived there had ten heads, people called him Ravan. Surrounded by mountains, more than rain the ground is impregnated with blood, a man there had just one head, people call him Ranagalu. The number of heads may be more but just one nature. You should've given a thorough thought before messing with me. Once you mess with me you will be finished. I am seeing Bhairathi Ranagalu for the first time. Very good. You are the only hope for our department. He owns several mines, Kapatrol is his main mining area. Apart from mines, he own several companies. He has created a huge syndicate to maintain them. Shabari is his right-hand and Singa is his left-hand. I had to kill police officer because of him. I'm collecting evidence against his illegal activities. The downfall of Ranagalu empire starts today. He is the only candidate, so... Excuse me, sir. - Yes. Ashwath Kudari is here to see you. You spared him saying he is a good man, he has now revolted against us. Earlier, he only used to stage protests with placards and now he is contesting elections. - I will contest elections on behalf of your party. Negligence can lead to major destruction. He is using Ashwath Kudari to rule over Ronapur. But I won't let him succeed. Summon Ravidran. Glory to Bhairathi Ranagalu! Glory to Bhairathi Ranagalu! Glory to Bhairathi Ranagalu! Glory to Bhairathi Ranagalu! Bhairathi Ranagalu has learnt that you're involved in the temple attack. This is not just Ronapur, this is Republic of Ronapur. The government doesn't a thing here. Hooliganism, harassment and violence, Bhairathi Ranagalu is responsible for all this. Common people like us cannot live here. His men threatened me not to file nomination for MP elections. His men are a threat to my life. If something happens to me Bhairathi Ranagalu is responsible for it. The government has to take action against him. Hello. Sister, I am James Jackson. You can join from tomorrow, please. I will wait for you, please. The arrangements should be made by tomorrow evening, summon all of them. Boss! I heard he shook hand with you, my men were not sure which hand, hence they cut off both his hands. You're betrayer, you're not trustworthy, you don't deserve to be alive. Until you're alive don't develop such thoughts. If you do, you head will be cut off. Take him in car. Okay, Boss. The one from the port area. Gana. Send him. Take it. This is for you because you saved my uncle. A little gift from me. Take it. Always be with my uncle. He's a very good man, if you be with him, I'll give you plenty of chocolate, okay? Friends? Avni! Bye. I have instructed him to come tomorrow. UNCLEAR Come on, let's eat. Hello. - Hello. Where are you? - What's the matter? What do you mean? Do you remember the promise you made when you proposed to me? I barely get to meet with you. Having a girlfriend is not a big deal, you should care about her. Shop # 17, Kangana Fashion, Alam Street, come fast. Don't come by bike, hire an auto rickshaw, it's urgent, fast. I was here to shop, after shopping, I saw henna, I liked it very much, I got it applied on my hand. I liked it much more, I got it applied on the other hand as well. They are beautiful, aren't they? I have scooter and luggage that's why I called you. Alright, pay him, let's go. Here you are. Boss goes for walking at 4 AM every day. 'From his chair to his cot, everything is made of gold.' "Who am I? Where do I come from?" "No one here knows." "There are many good people." "No one has seen my true color." "I am great, my name is Kanwarlal." "I am great, my name is Kanwarlal." "Who am I?" Come, Gana. I was not getting sleep in my room so I am in your room watching television. Have you collected evidence and proof? Normally, it is police who nab criminals but here, the criminal nabbed the police. What did you say that day? 'The man who has guts is valued until he is alive.' I will first expose you and then kill you. The one who you used to laud is an undercover police. I have caught him now, if you give orders I will finish him. Hello? Hello. Gana, kill him. I would've killed you at once but if you die without knowing why Singa instructed me to kill you your soul won't rest in peace. Pashupathy made an offer to you but you didn't betray. But I created fake proof to prove that you accepted the offer. You came here because you could not sleep, don't worry, you will sleep forever. No! This is your house? Be careful while playing on the road. Go to your mother. Sir, please wait. 'You will be ruined!' We thought you people made us homeless by bulldozing our old huts. But we never thought you people will build houses for thousands of people. On that day, I was shattered completely, I abused you people, I cursed you people. Please forgive me. I misunderstood you. Which village? Kartagi. Vedha, it's your birthday gift by your brother, why are tearing it? It's rakhi today, so I making rakhi for my brother with my dress. My life has become miserable. I look more like a watchman than a director. I hired him on the producer's recommendation but he has not arrived yet. Take! I am ready! Here's the scene and the dialogues... Let's shoot the combined scenes with the heroine first, I am in a romantic mood, okay? - Okay. You have chosen a beautiful heroine. Her face is photogenic. - Sir, she is assistant director. What? That's really not done. No problem. Give me that. You do one thing, explain the scene to me in detail. Sir... - I will... Sir, if she explains it, you won't understand, you will then find it difficult to act. What do you think I am! You idiot! Ravichandran for romance, Narasimha Raju for comedy, Vishnuwardhan for bravery, Shankar Nag for compassion, Ambrish for anger, Ananth Nag for politeness, Tiger Prabhakar for fighting skills, You idiot! What did you say? How dare you argue with me! Dr. Rajkumar for dedication, I possess the qualities of these nine great actors. I am a top silver screen actor. Go check. He is talking rubbish. - Shut up! Go and sit in front of the television. You job is only to say 'Okay'. Go. Well... - Okay. The director got angry. I wonder what's going to happen. If he comes asking for dates, shun him. By the way, what's your name? Raksha. Raksha. The name of the heroines starting from the letter 'R' are doing really well in Kannada film industry. If you permit me, I will safeguard you. Ready! Camera! - Okay! Where is the camera? - Action! I am filthy rich, I have everything that a man needs. Looks like the dialogues are written just for me. What kind of dialogues are these? The audience should applaud when I deliver dialogues. Change the dialogue. Excuse me. Raksha, don't worry, we have plenty of time. Let's discuss in leisure, okay? "Come to caravan." My God! I think even he got thrashed. Sir! People say even Ravindra Thewani will lose the elections. 'Rain of bullets outside NNR party office in broad daylight.' 'The armed men came in Maruthi Omni.' 'Luckily Ashwath Kudari escapes the attack and unfortunately, the driver died.' 'Bhairathi Ranagalu behind the murder.' 'The reason is recent developments in politics.' It is our car. We don't burst even firecrackers without your permission. I need a haircut. Did you have breakfast? - Yes, Boss. How many cars do we have? Boss, we have more than 40 cars. How many cars do you take care of? Three cars. Tell me their numbers. KA-34 6868, 7668, 5668. Tell me the number of the car I travel. KA-34 8999, 7999, 6999. Very good. Now, tell me the number of the car which was used to attack Ashwath Kudari. Boss, I don't understand what you are trying to say. 'Everything will be done according to your plan.' 'You need not worry.' 'Your men will attack Ashwath Kudari, but the car will be ours.' 'I mean, the men who will go to kill Ashwath Kudari, will be Bhairathi Ranagalu's men.' Boss, someone is conspiring against me. I've never done such a thing. Please trust me. I can never think of betraying you. Boss, I don't know. - How long you are working here? I would never think of doing so. - Don't you know who to keep and who to fire? Boss, please listen to me. Never mind even if the salary is high, keep a guide at his grave. Everyone should know how he died. The one who betrays us, shouldn't be spared. Send money to his family members every month. 'No one can stand against Bhairathi Ranagalu.' 'Contesting election against him is like creating a history.' 'Candidates against Ashwath Kudari, PK party member, Mr. Ravindra won the elections with 70,000 votes.' 'The entire city of Ronapur is celebrating.' Boss, enough. Don't mess with Bhairathi Ranagalu. We won't be able to do anything. We have toiled hard to come to this position. Now, we shouldn't invite trouble for ourselves. Yes, sir. We should not play with fire. Like sir said, we will fight and win the next election. You're related to me, but the bullets inside it is not affiliated with you. You're in power. You won't understand the pain that I am going through. I know what to do to him. You... I knew you wouldn't refuse to accept this, so, I bought plants for you. You take care of the plants so nicely, I am sure you will take care of the people too. I appreciate your decision of entering in politics, but the party you are supporting is corrupt. In the next election, contest as an independent candidate. Withdraw money from the bank and give it to them, then prepare your accounts. Okay, Boss. While taking the money... The chopper is broke, I have told the guys to get the car for you. Singa is not accepting calls since morning. I'm calling for a while. Gana will go with you. 'Gana, Shabari wants to meet Singa.' 'I'm going to Mangalore.' For the trust that you gained from past 30 years, what you are left is just a knife. The 100 acres land that will be auctioned tomorrow, will belong to you. In the next elections, you will be our party leader, and representative of Ronapur. I just want his death. Mr. Shabari Ramanathan! 1 time! Mr. Shabari Ramanathan! 2 times! Shabari... Gana? Actually... Singa told me the chopper broke down. I... Your time changed when you changed the watch. Until I ate food, you wouldn't even drink water. Even if you had a knife in your hand, I never doubted you. You worked for me for 30 years, these are the property documents of your wife and children. Today, this is 10 times more than the amount you desired. You took a hasty decision and invited your ruination. Shabari, don't try to apologize to me because I will not forgive you. I am sure that someone is dreaming of killing me. I'd given a chance. You played all sorts of games, but you couldn't even touch me. If I had your motive, you both brothers would be flying kites and not your party flag. If you're still not happy, you can make another effort. Uncle, who drew that picture? Well, when your mother was of your age, she drew it. It is me. And this is your mother. Uncle, why don't you and mother talk? Your mother is angry with your uncle. In the greed of money, he joined hands with the drug mafia and supplied medicines to all the hospital under the trust. Many people lost their lives. He killed the people in hospital so, he got angry and killed her sister's husband. Since that day, Vedha doesn't talk to boss. Hello, sir. - Hello. Why have you become silent today? Give him a chair! Okay. - No thanks. I asked chair for me, not for you. - Sir, here's the chair. Someone said they wouldn't come on the sets if they don't have a caravan. They've come here and settled on the sets like their property. He can manage without caravan, but he can't manage without his limbs. You get paid for being assistant director or to make fun of me? Get lost! Idiot. They are pulling my leg. Actually, you messed things up yourself. Forget that. What about your acting skills? ...It's a bad guy I forget all my acting skills. You never had acting skills. Don't hurt me. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, sister. The entire set shakes when I come but the set trembles when she comes. He is the director for this. Are you ready? I'm coming. He has become her assistant now? Who is that beautiful girl? Hi! Are you new? - What? No. I mean, are you a newcomer to the film industry? Are you ready? - Yes, I am ready. Jackson, come here, tell me the dialogues. I am coming. Turn on the lights. - Come on. A women's college? Excellent! - A beautiful girl will be standing at the bus stop opposite to the college. Yes. You... - Of course, she is. You will come to the bus stop. Here I am. You will see her. - Okay. You will like her. - That's fantastic! I liked her very much. She looks at you. I am indeed here so that she sees me. You will whistle as you stand beside her. After a while, you will raise your hand and... Where do I place it? - On her shoulder. Is that all? Anything else? There is but you will do what we say. How? - She will do that. Where? Over here? In that place. It's a wonderful scene! Why did not you tell me earlier? Only then you will find out that she's karate expert. Why didn't you tell me earlier? - I am telling you now. Hey! - The concept of the film is every girl should learn karate for self-defense and I wish you all the best. She will now deal with him. - Why... Jackson! Oh, my God! Sister, shall we change the climax scene? Ready! Camera! - Rolling! Action! - Action! Sister, had he told me the scene beforehand I would've taken safety precaution. No problem. I will request you. Please don't be too violent towards me. What do you say? - Charge! My God! - That was brilliant. Sir. Wipe the blood, ma'am wants one more take. Boss is inside. Come on, let me show you something. I made it. It's uncle's birthday today, I'm going to present this to him. This is uncle and this is mom. That's me and that's your mother. I understand everything that my teacher teaches me in school but I do not understand why mom and uncle do not talk each other. They are here to see your brother. They are not related to him by blood, they still travel several miles to give him their best regards. You are his real sister, though you stay with him, you have distanced him from you. He provides food to thousands of people, being his sister, you refuse to serve food to him. He must be deeply pained about it. Bhairathi Ranagalu brings justice even to strangers, but as far as his sister is concerned, he has taken a strong decision so there must be some reason. The two dolls are lifeless but your child is trying to unite them. But you are not making up your mind to patch up with your brother forgetting the past. Though there are hundreds of people waiting out there he's hoping that his sister will wish him first. If not as a sister, consider yourself as one of those people and wish him. Did you have dinner? Not yet, Brother. I'm waiting for my husband. You must promise me something. What promise? You must never leave me and go. Don't even ask me why. Your husband will never return. Brother, you could've told me that you killed my husband because he was a bad man. How could I? You knew how much I love you but you still fell in love with someone. I realized how much you love him so I got you married to him but if you find out he was corrupt you will grieve all your life. So I thought you rather hate me taking me to be a bad man. Entire Ronapur will be happy because of boss but today you have restored happiness into boss's life. He wants to talk to you. He is calling you to his room. Come, Gana. Come. Sit down. I am very happy today that's why I am celebrating. Many people work in our house, some work outside of the gate, some inside the gate and some work inside the house. But you you have won my heart. It's been years since my sister called me brother. You brought us together again. Ask me whatever you want. Do not hesitate, ask me for anything you want. As far as humanity is concerned you are a philanthropist. But have you ever felt that you're a criminal as far as government is concerned? The government? Which government? Are you talking about the government that made me an orphan when I was just 12? The villagers were pleading for help from the government but it never showed up. Are you talking about that government? God creates man but the system creates demons. 'You don't let me even have food.' 'You fight for people all the time.' 'Give it to me.' 'I have written several letters of complaint but no action was taken.' 'My hand will break if I keep replying to your letters.' 'Won't you consider our efforts?' 'It will definitely be considered.' 'There is a fritter stall outside if you give these papers to the fritter seller he will be happy and and will give you some fritters.' 'You and your son get back to your village eating fritters.' Since he couldn't fulfill the need of the people and because he lost hope he got bedridden. There was tumor in his stomach, we required a lot of money for the surgery we didn't have so much money. He suffered all night due to severe pain. The whining sounds still echo in my ears. I decided that nobody else should go through the same pain. The hatred in me turned me into a criminal. The people of this village don't know how a ration card looks like but as long as I am alive I won't let anyone starve. I'm not sure if the government is doing its duty or not but I have made all the arrangements until the next generation. The Britishers came to our country just to sell spices but they ruled the country for 300 years for their needs. So what's wrong if I ruled my village for the well-being of the villagers? No one can dare to destroy the village. No one can dare to destroy the village. Never. Never. No one can... No one can dare to destroy the village. Hello. - Yes. The evidence and the proof you have collected so far is enough to arrest him. Leave at the earliest. I will tell you the reason for this. Two brothers word restlessly for a party for several years. One of them gets a chance to become Chief Minister because of their hard work. Just one day was left for the younger brother to become the Chief Minister. The two brothers eagerly wait until morning for that moment but a demon who is greedy about money poaches the MLA that night itself and make his aide the Chief Minister. That arrogant man is Bhairathi Ranagalu. The enemy who wants to kill him is me, Raghuveer Bhandri. I've been trying my best to kill him but you've been protecting him. That's why I am getting rid of you. Kill him. Do not waste even one bullet, pump all the bullets into Bhairathi Ranagalu's body. 'Do not use even one brick to build my grave.' 'Do everything for the people.' I am still not satisfied by what you said, I'll be satisfied only when you die. Your father was the only person to sacrifice his life. I want to give you a terrible death. Do not kill him easily I won't be pleased. You still did not understand my patience is stronger than your vengeance. It is futile even if you understand that now. 'Bhairathi Ranagalu, infamously known as the walking God to Ronapur surrenders himself to CBI.' 'Investigation in several illegal activities is underway.' 'Chaos in Ronapur and several due to the incident.' 'The government has failed to bring the law and order under control.' I had not told you who I am. Gana is CBI officer in civil dress. I was here for Bhairathi Ranagalu. He came to arrest me but he developed respect towards me instead. He is a criminal to the government but for people he is a servant. Gana has done so much for me, what have I done for him? I performed my duties for all these years now I have to give him a chance to perform his duties. I didn't tell you about it because it was a secret operation. I am sorry. My sister is here, excuse me.
