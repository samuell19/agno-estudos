After a succession of gales and storms, is fair weather again on the mountain. The night is quiet, although the cold is intense. But who are these men who advance cautiously? At the first evening shadows they crossed the border at the pass known only to them, and now, already in a foreign land, they go to their destination. Only the need drives them toward risks and hazards, with death lurking, in eternal struggle for existence. The mountain is their means of life. But there are other men living on the mountain, at night, certainly not in struggle for existence. Beaches and cruises in summer, and the mountain in winter. During the day the thrill of speed, skiing and bobsleigh, and in the evening the cozy lounges of the major hotels, warm as greenhouses. Monsieur? - Whisky, double. White horse. Please, there is nothing better than skiing, drinking or dancing, here? Monsieur... means gambling? - Also gambling. Monsieur has not yet been to "Chez Lucien"? - No, where is it? Écoutez, monsieur, 10 minutes by car, on the road to Chambave, there is a sort of chalet with a large gate, just before reaching the bridge. Thank you. American? Alright. For you the usual commission. Understood. Goodbye. Yes, goodbye. Excellent references: American, rich... What are you looking at? - The rich American. I think it's him. What a magnificent custom-built car! He's coming just now. I beg you, Jean, the season is lackluster. My expenses are up to here. I need money! I drown! The American must leave here everything he has. If he loses. - He must lose! - No! At the tables you play clean, as long as I'm here. These were the terms. If you needed a cheater, you had to contact someone else to your confidence. But I need the money. I shall force you! No one has ever forced me to do what I don't want. Understood? Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Rien ne va plus! Eight! Rien ne va plus. We pay three, red and manque. Shall we close sooner? It's all quiet. It's not the time. How much are we under? - Two million. It doesn't matter, keep up to the preset time. The client must rely on the dealer, remember that. - Yes, sir. There is just the money for the trip. - I beg you, give me that too. Bye! 500,000 francs the bank. Who calls bank? Bank! - Deal out, sir. How's everything? Hello! Card. Two. Good for the bank. - Oh, such luck! That's awful! One million the bank. Bank. Pass, pass, pass. - Bank. To me. To the gentleman. Nine. - Eight. And baccarat! I won. I won! I won this time. Good evening. We're still in the black. Rien ne va plus. Madame, rien ne va plus. Zero. - Zero! Sir, can you lend me 100,000 francs? - Sorry, ma'am, I can not. I beg you! - I can't. Close the door. Don't you see I'm getting dressed? May I know what you want? You look at me. Haven't you ever seen me? Well? You've lost your word? You look even more beautiful! I'm glad I married you! Get off me! You came to tell me this? Come on, come on. Spit it out! I know you. It's for the usual story of Giovanni. He owes me everything, but if he continues to do his own thing, I'll throw him out! - Yes? And you're telling me? Do as you please. - But, you see, if you talked to him, if you told him something... No, huh! I won't get involved in your mess. But you're my wife! You gotta help me! Your wife? I agreed to marry you just for your money, and because you told me that we would return to America. You dragged me here, among these mountains I hate, in this hovel that oppresses me. It's better not to remind me that I'm tied to you, because I get the urge to chuck it all. - Mary, listen to me... I brought the dealer's cash. Be nice this evening. At the first table is Mr. Rock. Aren't you jealous? No. I try to do the interests of you and your husband. Go. Can't you hear them applauding you? Go. - Encore! Encore! Encore! Hey! Come on, come on! No! Let go of me! What do you want from me? Oh, Italian! We are compatriots, fine. May I know what you were doing out there? Won't you answer? You were spying, right? - No! Come on. You can tell me. I'm not of the police. I saw you spying behind the window. Who, or what, were you looking for? I wasn't spying, I looked. - Really? At 3 in the morning? With 7° below zero? After scaling the wall of the courtyard, risking your neck? Does it still hurt? I'm sorry, but, thus dressed, who could imagine you were a woman? Here, drink, it'll do you good. Don't you want? I drink it myself. So who are you? What are you doing here? It is her? - Yes. We've been looking everywhere. Come on. In the garage, huh? What are these mysteries? Who is she? - I'll explain, let's go. They must not be seen here. Here she is. But you know that we may all end up in jail? Then, what's the idea to take along a woman? I carry 25 kilos on my back, and know the mountain like them! Man or woman, who cares? She has a long tongue. - She's Paolo's wife. He's sick, so she took his place. But Paolo has always been prudent, and he didn't go around getting caught! You get it now? They are your compatriots. Without a passport. - Illegal emigrants? Yes,.. more or less. Emigrants from here, emigrants from there, emigrants from here... They pass the border with a bit of merchandise. Even this you do? - Well, you gotta make a living, right? When do you leave? - Well, we're late. We should be back already. True, Marco? Don't worry. A truck leaves tonight. It will take you up to Varecourt. You spare a two hour walk. Come on. Go upstairs, you. I'll be going for the load. May I come too? Come if you wish. Smuggling, huh? How many trades are done in the world. Not that I'm surprised of that. But, I say, it yields you a lot? Well, it helps. It serves to go ahead, the land in the mountains is poor. But where are you from? You don't want to answer? You do well. However you can trust me, I too am Italian, from the Alps, from Cadore. From Cadore? I've been there when I was military. During the last war we were two months with the battalion. I was on your side, y'know. - Oh! "Whatever It Takes"! I too was in the Alpine troops. Battalion Cadore. It seems to me a century has passed. How long it takes you to get back beyond? - Eight hours, walking briskly. But the truck will save two hours. There is a curve at Varecourt, that... You still wary of me? Yet we'll become friends. As true as that I will bear for a while the mark of your teeth. Look at the crown that she made me. By the way, when you pass beyond, would you greet Italy for me? It's 100 grams. If the deal is successful next time I'll give you more. You just have to give it to whom I told you. For you, here is: 5,000 lire. No, I want ten. If they nail me, I'll go to jail, not you. I already gave you 30,000! But we have to divide it into four. I don't carry the powder alone. 10,000 or nothing. All right! Hide this. Let's do quickly, huh? Go away. And in two days I wait for you. So long. See you! Bank! Deal out, sir. It's incredible. My luck is running out! To you, sir. Eight! Good for the bank. To you, sir. Nine for the bank. One million and 600,000 francs, the bank. - Hey there. Why didn't you come in my room? I waited for you. You know that I discovered a new activity of your husband? What you looking at? They leave. They are some countrymen. Some poor devils. They make 16 hours of mountain for a piece of bread. There is also a woman with them. Pretty? Say... Hey, say... Look here. They are many, you know? Feel how much they weigh. I want to buy that piece of land that Bertolino had from that crazy Englishman. And I want to build on it the nicest grange in the valley. You'll die from envy. - Me? For all I care! Why did you marry Paolo? You had to marry me, stupid. Cut it out! Come here close to me, so you'll feel less cold. And stay still! Thank you, Giuseppe goodbye. Quick, get off! Come on! Let's go! Thank you, go ahead. Well, let's split up. I will warn you when we go back. Alright. Say hi to Paolo. Good, right? As a man. - She's on the ball! Goodbye! I don't go to the village with you, I go down the gully. Goodbye. Come on. Alina! Is that you? Yes, here I am. Oh, at last! Everything fine? - How do you feel? Well, as usual. And then, so alone. You cannot do differently until you're healed. It takes patience. - Tell me, how was it? - Good. When you pass the border, the heart is in the throat, but then... You're the bravest woman in the whole valley. Poor Alina! And you had to happen to be next to this rag. Come on, you must not say these things. A wimp who can not stand up. And I fell into such a sadness! You do bad to brood so. You mustn't go anymore. I need you, your affection, you know. You're like a daughter to me. - Come on, don't be anxious now. You must not go, it's not for a woman. - We'll talk again later. Come on, sleep. It is dawn yet. You took your medicine? - Yes, yes. I'll be right. What is it? Huh? Oh, poor Nerina, you're right. Here is to eat. I had just forgotten about you. Here, eat. Come on, eat quietly. Come on! I'll stay here to keep you company. How tired I am! I can't take no more! Get off me! Get off me! Coward! - I'm crazy about you! Crazy! Go away! No! Get off me! Let go of me! I will not! No! Go away! Go away, you coward! All right! You won't always have an ax handy, and sooner or later... Go away! I'm dead tired, but I still have enough breath to smash your head! Do not bother. Rest, and sleep tight. And think of me when you'll be tired of living in misery by day, and of sleeping in peace at night. Here you go. So... Zero,.. four, seven, three... Three thousand seven hundred fourty. What do we do with this affair, Alina? For visits, I can wait, but I don't get the medicines for free. Have patience, Doctor. Take this in the meantime. Within days I'll settle it all. - Well,.. if it is to just wait a few days, okay. But,.. I hear that you got in with those fellows, you know? With those who are often seen at Bertolino's tavern. Alina! You do wrong, in confidence. - One has to live, right? The medicines, and visits, and the rest. When you have nothing... I said this for you, you know. In the village they gossip... - Let them gossip! With chatter you don't live. Good day. - Good day. I took commitment to immediately send that stuff. - When? Tomorrow. It's a good deal and I don't want to look bad. - Tomorrow, tomorrow! Easy to say tomorrow for you, who're here to tend your fat! Yes, but if the gain is good, it's a shame to give it up. Are you game? - Yes. Well, then we'll go. As usual, you need to be in four to take the whole load. I'll warn Marco and... I'm always about to say Paolo, poor fellow. Who'd ever say that he would be reduced like that. We'll meet at the white rocks, at sunset. Then it's fixed, I count on it. Cheers! - Cheers! Oh, go through the Puriac. Those ones were there last night, and for some days they won't go back. Speaking of 'those'... Be careful! "Wolf in the store", as they say. Hello, sergeant! - Good morning. A bottle? - Well! And bottle be. Immediately! - 'Morning. - Good morning, sergeant. Here you go. Winter is over and the trade begins again. True, Bertolino? - Well, trade... A little wine that is sold. Well, wine... The wine and the rest. My word, sarge, I don't understand. Shall we play cards? - Here they are. We miss the fourth player. - If you like, I can be the fourth. Perfect, come, come! You sit there and I on this side. We'll be companions, for once. I bet we'll drink this bottle for free. And the weather, beyond, in France, how was it? In France? And who's been there! Oh, you haven't been there? No, sergeant. Excuse me, I come from your home. I saw that Paolo is ill, and I didn't want to make a scene, but you're healthy, and one can reason with you. Yes, he's sick, it is an accident. - I'm sorry, but what have I to do? I only know that I sold you a nice calf five months ago, and so far I saw only the money for the deposit. You are right. Now I say: Out of the money, or back the beast. I too have a heart, but the interest is interest. So long. Alina! - Oh, Andrea. How goes Paolo? Always the same? - How do you want him to go? Look, Andrea, to you I can tell. We can no longer get ahead. This illness of Paul eats all what little we have. Take me with you again. You saw that I can do it? Yeah! A small job for you there would be just tomorrow. But aren't you afraid to get compromised? Once is okay, but you're alone, people are quick to badmouth. - What do you think I care! Also the doctor told me before. - Yes, agreed. No one ever forgave you for being from the city. Thank you, Andrea. See you tomorrow. - Thanks for what? Alina! - Why did you get up? Didn't you hear the doctor the other day? Yes, but, I seemed to feel a little better. All right! As long as you stay quiet by the fire. And don't start wandering through home, huh? See? I brought grappa. - Oh, thank you! Oh, you know? I have great news for you. We got rid of a big burden. Which burden? The concern about the calf. Are you serious? - Look! See for yourself. But how is this possible? - You see them? They're 30 in number. And all good, you know? All of the Bank of Italy. Payable to bearer, see? I learned it by heart. - But no! No deadlines, y'know, and no interest, to be repaid at our leisure. Don't make me die. Where are they from? Guess. - How would I know? Marco. Marco? Yes. An offer from a friend, from the heart. He had heard of our problems, so... - A friend, yes! To be trusted! What is it, Alina? - It's that you shouldn't, just from him! He gave them to you to buy me, don't you get it? To obligate me! How's that!? Even last night in the stable, if you must know. I had to defend myself with the ax, from your friend! Oh, is that so! Is that so! We must return them immediately. At once! He'll pay for this! - Never mind him. I can defend myself, I have no fear. And for the calf, do not worry. We'll pull out. Tomorrow we go back to France with Andrea. It's good money. - No. I don't want to, it's dangerous. - No, I'll go. Tomorrow,.. once again and forever! The whole life! Just to return them. You will return them, won't you? Yes. Well! It's nice being by the fire. Tonight it's freezing. And that wind! Take your feet off the table! And don't change the subject. I couldn't care less, of the frost and wind. Yeah, because you're fine here in the heat, next to the fireplace. But I must go there in the mountains. Listen to me, look... 20,000, and the deal is done. No, you give me thirty grand. And the goods will be delivered tomorrow. Don't you care that your customer beyond the mountains gets the powder? By the way, what is it like to sniff it? - Do not meddle in this. All right! 30,000 as you say. But the goods must be delivered in the morning. Get it? - Good. Don't say anything to your pals. - Who's talking! I won't split with them. And then they're old-fashioned. They make smuggling with tobacco, with saccharin, with perfumes... Tramps! And now scram. Hide the goods well. Go! Hopefully you have better luck tomorrow. And you do not accompany us? - Oui, madame. The loads are ready? - Ready. - Good. Let's do quickly. 20 kilos, light load. We'll try the pass of Pic Maudit. It's sheltered and we'll be faster. But it's more dangerous. - Why, you afraid? We've always saved our hides. And alina? - She sleeps. Are you kidding? See, Marco, we talked about it before with Giulio. Alina can't make it. She slipped twice on the glacier, she's too tired. Let her sleep. We'll notify Paolo. In two days, when we come back down, we'll take her back. No, she must come with us. Then who carries her load? We can divide it among us. - It's impossible, we have our own. She wanted to get in these risks, she pays! And then you want to know? I'm not leaving Alina here! And why? Here she has nothing to fear. Look, I'm a mountaineer too. The wind has risen, chances are you'll find the blizzard. It's hard to pass not only for a woman, even for you. Why not stay here? - No! Then you know, this is our life, of risks. Come on, let's not waste any more time. I'm going to wake Alina. Sorry, if you want, you're free to break your neck. Your own, though. She's a woman, leave her alone. - But why do you meddle? Go pluck your chickens, the mountain is not for you. I know the mountain like you. I say she can't do it in the blizzard! Come on! Then we'll tell Paolo that Alina remained here. - All right! But it takes guts to report certain things. You hint as a coward. - Who's a coward? - But we'll settle accounts! When you wish! - Come on, let's go! Goodbye. - So long. So, what do we do? - Let's take refuge in the cave. No, we must continue. - No, in the cave! Damn. I don't take it anymore! Well, what do you do? We must continue. We have to deliver the load. Well, no one will die if Bertolino waits a few hours to get the goods. In short, I don't go on! All right! I'm going alone. No, come here, let's drink a drop of grappa together. But is he serious? - Aw, let him go! - Marco! Marco! I don't believe in this story of the load. I never liked Marco. - I don't get it, what do you mean? Tell me why Marco doesn't go down the Roscia like us and at the gully of Vies he stops at the roadman’s house under Paolo's grange. The roadman’s house? - Yeah! - What's he doing there? You're smart! Go figure. However, at the roadman's house there is always a car licensed Turin. Get it? Why, you think that..? I think. Come in. Come in! Holy God! But how..? - Excuse me. Why did you leave the garage? - I woke up and I was alone. Where are my pals? By now they crossed the border. - Gone without me? I must reach them! With this wind? There will be a blizzard. - Let me go. - Stop it! You want another punch? Remember the other night? And don't be so sad! Come on, smile. Sit down. You don't want to wait for your pals standing? But I had to be there. Someone's waiting for me. But Giulio and the other promised to warn your husband. I just wish I knew who has let me sleep. It was me. Don't look at me like that. You were sleeping so well. You want a coffee? A cigarette? Now you had better stay here quietly. Shortly I must get back in the gaming room. We too are a bit like you, the night is day, and day is night. But one gets used to it, like for all things in life. Of course, it was not always so. I too once loved the sun, and the life that everyone else is doing. I was an alpine trooper. Then the war, Russia, imprisonment, and on my return nothing more. All destroyed, all over. Start over, take the same way that led me to the end of it all? No. And so, you get to leave the country. A month here, one there. Without believing in anything. Thus,.. letting yourself live. And you have anyone over there? - No one. Don't you ever desire to return to your country? Homesickness? A good drink of cognac and all things pass. But why am I telling you all this? Maybe because I too am from there, and we're both in a foreign land. Right. But for doing what you do, you must love much your husband. We are poor, and he is sick. You have to work for a living. When my father died, Paolo took me with him. I was very young and people talked. So, he married me. Excuse me, then.. he's much older than you. If possible, I would return in the garage. Madame? Finally! I was wondering if you hadn't run away. May I, madame? This is a compatriot. She's part of the group at your husband's orders. Alina, this is Mrs. Lucien, wife of the owner of the shack. She stayed here for the storm. Very well. In your room.. Actually in the garage, earlier. If you allow, I'll leave. Oh, no. Why would you go back in the garage? Come in there, there's many people. Ma'am, please... Alina is a very simple woman. Since when you like simplicity? I thought you had different tastes. This girl is just awaiting the return of her friends. If you deem,.. take care of her. Excuse me. Come. Oh, you're truly pretty. And you do smuggling? Aren't you afraid? But a lovely girl like you should fare better in life. I have an idea. Would you like to see our place? Well, actually... I have to stay hidden. If I get caught.. - Of course, dressed thus. But if you wore a dress... I think I have what fits you well. But, what do you want to do? Jean has entrusted you to me. Don't you trust? The wind has dropped, it doesn't snow. Let's go. We'll arrive at dawn. Won't they catch us, the sergeant and his men? Let's try. We'll keep our eyes open. More grappa? No thanks, no more booze if I want to keep my eyes open. Les jeux sont faits! Rien ne va plus! Rien ne va plus! 14, rouge, pair et manque. Pay the 14! 14 is payed, thank you. Thank you. Les trois derniers! Last three rounds, gentlemen! Les trois derniers, messieurs. Faites vos jeux. But what came over you? Why dress her up like that? Just look at her! Isn't she a darling? Oh, I won't touch your hand, don't worry. Come on, now drink a little. Just a drop. - Yes, have a drink. - It won't hurt you. That's it, good girl, that way. It's good, you see? You like? Good, isn't it? But I don't know how to dance. - Try it. Imagine! As if I were a dancer! Have no fear, come on. What does it take? Didn't you say she was very simple? I wanted to prove it to you. Come away. - What do you want, you? The lady cannot dance. - Why? - None of your business. If you want fun, get another girl. - But I wanted to dance just with her! What were you thinking? Don't you see she's making fun of you? I don't know what to do! The lady said I was all right, you told me to trust, I... I don't know what... What to do, right? Start by putting your own clothes. And then remain in my room! Got it? My head is spinning! - Oh, it spins, huh? It spins... Oh God, I feel sick! - A sure remedy. Some fresh water will do good. It spins... - Come on, be brave. - God... - Without fear. Come on, come on... There you go! But really, how dare you? Go away! Out of here, out! I.. I don't want to see you! Get out! - Okay. Calm down. - I hate you! I'll be back shortly. Dry yourself. See you later. Go away... Alina! Who is it? - It's me. Open up! Marco!? And Alina, where is she? What happened? Nothing. I came to warn you that she remained down there. At Chambave? And why? - For the bad weather, she says. How's that, she says? - Isn't it a good excuse? I mean, isn't it a good reason? Which excuse? Look, Marco, speak clearly, or... Or what? Hey, you take that tone with me? I come here with a blizzard to tell you what I know, as a friend, and this is the thanks? You really believe, poor fool, that she troubles herself for you? That every week she crosses the mountains for you? Marco, you're a scoundrel. A coward! I know why you say it. But Alina is honest. The most honest woman in the world! Well, if you're happy... - But I know why you say it! And while we're at it, I warn you: leave her alone! Don't you dare ever again, or as true as God, I... How well he plays the comedy! Look at him! He realized everything, and turned a blind eye. But when it suits him, he accepts my money! The money? - Yes, the money! Oh, yeah? Here it is, your dirty money! I'll slam it in your face, your bloody money! I'll spit on it, and I'll slam it in your face! That's how you treat the bills of 1,000? You don't know what they cost. Get out. Get out of here! You shouldn't recoup with me. When you feel a bit better, go and take a peek around in Chambave. You'll find a surprise. By the name of Giovanni. - Go away! Go away! - Hands off! Marco.. Marco.. Marco! Help me! Marco! Marco! Marco! Help me, Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco, my legs... I can't feel them anymore, Marco! Take me away! I cannot move, Marco! My legs! I can't move them anymore! Help me, Marco. Marco! Marco! Help me! Marco! No! Marco! Marcooo! The fire! The fire! The fire! Drink. And leave the figures, they're not your forte! Who can it be? Not those. They knock in a very different way. So then we open? All right, open it. Oh, Alina. - May I come in? If you may? What kind of question! Sure you may! God forbid that you couldn't. May I sit down? What is it, Alina? Why did you come? - I want to talk to you! Bertolino isn't here? - He's there. - Call him. Take this, Alina, it'll do you good. A nice glass of wine. Drink! Wine is good for you. In the morning, yes, trust me. Alina wants to talk to you. We must help her. - Coming, coming, go ahead. He's coming. But look how stupid! Wine in the morning, to revolt her stomach! No, no, that's fine. I'm dying of thirst. So, you feel better? Better! Thanks for the charity! What's with charity now? We're all Christians, right? Let her be. - Who'll touch her! You too up against me? But what have I done? I'm not arguing with women. - All like that! Not one accusing me in the face of anything. They look the other way, when I pass. - Us? Yes, even you, who know me well, who were friends of poor Paolo! But we left you there, that night. How can anyone accuse you? After the accident I would have come to see you, to the police, but there's who fanned the flames and shed poison. And they've believed it! The women especially, all against you. But why? - And you ask? Of course I ask, I have a clear conscience! I have always been an honest woman. When he became ill, I nursed him with patience, resignation. I struggled in misery like a beast, never lifting my head from work. Is it my fault if I was away when the accident happened? Answer me! You, Bertolino, if you're the decent person that I always believed.. You've made a nice rant, but you could spare it. Faithful wife, working woman... No one ever put it in doubt. Unrelated to the accident? Even the judge said so, I know by heart. But, first point: you went on the mountains with men. It was to keep things going, okay, but it wasn't liked. And by me least of all. Women at home, here's how I see it. What's wrong if it's done for a good purpose? - Here she's right! I'm not finished. You are not criticized for having left alone Paolo sick. You're not criticized for being absent just when you could have saved him. You are asked, and this time, if you allow, the question is put by us to you, what happened. What did you do after that Andrea, Giulio and Marco had left? You had or not some ladylike earrings that no one had ever seen on you? When you returned they all saw them. - Ah, that's what! How I spent the rest of the night! The suspicion alone offends me. But I will answer you. You know of Lucien's place, you know that we can't stay there for long for fear of the border police. So they advised me to change clothes to mingle with the people there. They convinced me, but not for long. All of a sudden I felt a sort of blow. Almost as if someone were calling me. And so I ran away, I got lost in the storm, in the snow. At dawn I was arrested. You can believe it or not believe it, but this is the truth! What more do you want from me? To hear you talk, before, we felt full of shame and remorse. Come back with us, Alina, as if nothing had happened, and forgive us. I don't want you to quarrel with your women because of me. No, no. Go away. We'll talk to our women, don't you worry. Enough with gossip and innuendo! You are poor, you need to earn. We,.. unfortunately, we can just offer you work. Do you want to? I do not ask more. In a few days we'll return to France. Come with us for now. After that, you'll do what you want. You are young, Alina. You can rebuild your life. Come in. Madame? - Mister Jean, quickly. - Oui, madame. You asked for me? I was in the hallway. Look, Jean, I must talk to you. Sorry, I can't, I'm busy. Now you're busy, now you're always busy. First, the roulette's money, before that, the croupier to be fired, this morning the telegraph office and the accounts with Lucien. You know it's three days that we don't exchange a word? Yes, I know. So what? - You see? Here's all you can reply! Look, Mary, you know that I don't like these scenes, they bother me. If the work in here has increased, do not blame me, but your husband. Moreover for some time he spies on me, and makes me spy on. Let's get out of here, let's run away. Right away, if you want. I have no money, and you're used to a very costly life. We would break up a week later. - But I have money. - No, thanks! I have not yet come to this. At least tell me that nothing changed between us. - Oh no. That there is no other woman in your life. What is it, the queen of spades again? - You mock me! - Well, I... And now where you going? What's so urgent that you can't stay a moment with me? But really, I have to justify my every step? Huh? Fine. I come from your husband's office, and now I go down in the garage. Those Italians arrived and I have to settle accounts. This is the money. Want to know more? There is... her too? Yes. There is her too. You won't even listen to me? You're wrong. You're free at last, you can do as you like. What do you care what has been? Listen to me... - Get off me! Alina! I might do something crazy, you know? What do you want? They're correct the packages? Everything in order? - 46. This is the money, count it. Thanks. Hungry, huh? Bon appetit. Want some? - No, thanks. But it's bread. - I see that. Tired, huh? - Oh, we are accustomed. And what goes on in Italy? You're amazed that I ask? It's always like this when one is away. One's own country... It seems that one is happy only when is there. Oh, I'm sorry. I did not mean, I heard... Alina is a strong woman. You saw? She's back with us. It's correct, thank you. You got that? Everything is in place. The money is right and you may as well go. We must rest. Alina is tired. Leave her alone. Well, what's with you? - Don't mind him. Look, I don't allow you this tone, either with her or with me. Have you heard? Here he is, taking her defenses. Young man, that's enough. I don't like your bossy air and your constant allusions! Will you explain? - Sure! She's not like those you hang out with. She's got no money! Bastard! Watch out! Marco, what are you doing? Stay still. Drop the revolver! Come on, take her away. - Put it down, put it down! Let go, Marco! Hey, but really, have you gone crazy? This is the last time we're together, I've got you figured out. I'll tell you only one thing: beware of yourself. You'd better stay here for now. And get some rest, it will do you well. Surely you won't go away now? Sit down. And don't think about what happened. Soon the fury will fade, in that one. You won't tell me that you're a fearful woman! Why are you trembling? I don't know what to do. Do not worry. It is a moment of loss. You want me to take you home? We're friends, me and the mountain. Home... I no longer have a home. I have no one! Come on, Alina, come on. Come on, now I know everything about you. The same thing happened to me when I returned. I haven't found anything. House, affection, nothing. It was her the queen of spades! No! Don't leave me. Don't worry, just a moment. A small issue to settle once and for all. Wait for me. So then, tomorrow morning in Chambave at 10:00. Hello? Police? At the tavern of Lucien, you know? What? The tavern of Lucien. Listen.. Yes. Yes. We'll go right away! She's hiding on the first floor. Come now! What have you done? Wretch! They hung up! Come! But you won't be happy either! Jean! Jean! Jean, forgive me! Jean, listen to me! Jean! Let us go away together. Let's start a new life together! Jean, don't leave me. Jean! We need to be clear. It was true, then. I always suspected you. And you were the only person in the world that I truly loved. You have destroyed everything! And now you have to pay. Attention! Attention! This is Chambave Police Department. We sighted on the road to the Italian border a group of smugglers. How far to the bend of Varecourt? - Three or four kilometers. Go still ahead, I'll tell you. We have received your message. We head immediately on the spot. The police! - Where? - Behind us. Get off the road, turn off the headlights and head to the side! Down! Down! A patrol almost in front of us! We'd better split up, we'll be less noticeable. You, Giulio, go up that way. It seems a more covered path. Check if we can pass. Make me a signal. We wait here! Good guy, that one there. You, come with us. We'll pass by the glacier and pull them behind us. And them? You, Alina, pass with Giovanni by the white rocks. It is clear! They've been warned. Well, we managed so many times, we'll get through this too. The signal! Come, Marco. So long, guys. We go too? What do we do? No. He said that we must pass by the white rocks. Down! There are three men that way. They're giving us chase. Scared? There's such a silence here, that I seem to hear your heart beat. We can't stay here, let's go that way. - No, wait. We don't know what can happen. They can catch us, shoot at us, divide us. I want to at least tell you, though, that whatever happens, you can always count on me. And if I can cross the border, I stay in Italy forever. Let's go. Beware! A patrol! - Where? Where? - Down there! They didn't see us, they're three. - Yes, they're in three. It's the same patrol as before. - No, it's another. They go away. - They're going? Marco, you go ahead. - No, I'm going back. Why? - I will not leave those two alone. Cursed when I listened to you. Listen, Marco, you... Marco! Marco! Marco! Get down, here they are again! Where were you hit? Let me see. - It's nothing. Have you heard? A pistol shot! - It's mine. It came from the white rocks. It's nothing. They missed me by little, though. Rest for a moment. - No, better go on. Let's go in the cave of the white rocks, quick! Come! Give me something to light. - Yes. There is a fact I don't get. The shot came from very close, and yet nobody reached us. After the shot, neither a voice... nor a step, nothing! Let me see. Nothing serious. - Oh, no. Only a graze. - Yes, trifles. Rather, how do you feel? Don't worry about me. I'll go get some water. Here is the water. - Thank you. It's just a scratch. Yes, but you lost a lot of blood. There, you see? Lean here, you'll be more comfortable. It's nothing. I should have some cognac in a pocket. Yes, there. Thank you. We'll have to stay hidden all day. But tonight, when we go down, we'll see what we can do. Andrea is my friend... But... you'll be coming with me? You will not return to Chambave? No. I'm done with that life. I'll start all over again. Let's start all over again. Do you want to? You'll start again nothing. It's over, instead. Don't move or I'll kill you! You, Alina, come with me. - Now I know who shot me. Me? It will be a little difficult to prove. But enough talk. Come on, my pretty, get out! I'll settle accounts with this city slicker once and for all. Get out! Now he pays it all together. Out, quick! What do you do? No, stop! Do not shoot! Do not shoot! No! No, you coward! No! Do not shoot! No! No! Get away! No! Come on... Don't move, wait here. Marco! - Look out! Stop! - Marco! - Stop him! Don't look! Reassure yourself. It was an accident. Wasn't it? An accident. We bear witness. Look, by here you go to France, by there to Italy. We're going home. It is best that you don't get found here. Shall we lead you the way? English subs by edam17@KG September 2013
