And what you doin' to those boots? My daddy's boots. He left 'em to me. Uh, they're a couple of sizes too big. They slip off if I don't stuff some paper in 'em. Okay, now, you take us in, but don't be sneakin' no looks at my picture of Irene. I don't want to have to hurt nobody. [Engine Starts] Hey, Baba! You seen Albert or Tyrone? Yeah, they eloped and moved to Jersey. [Man Yelling] [Harold] Where's Albert and Tyrone? [Dell] They went to Mass. [Overlapping Chatter] [Dell] Harold, was that a violin? [Harold] Holy shit!

I thought I lost you, brother. Sure. Two white guys up in front. Nigger in the back with a gun. What do you expect? Are you okay, Tyrone? Now, I am! Oh! Listen. Let me tell you somethin'. You're lucky those pork chops didn't shoot ya and say you was crazed on P.C.P. 'Cause that's what they always say about everybody they shoot. And I think they're lacin' the bullets with P.C.P. That way, they got an alibi for killin' everybody. Now, think about it. [Chattering] Excuse me. Where's the violin? [Man] I got a guitar. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Where is it? - Well, uh, we want to know about our reward. Yeah. What about the reward? Whatever the reward is, it's gonna go to Harold, 'cause he's the one who owns whatever cab it was found in, all right? All right! Hold it! [Whistling] I want my money, man! All right, hold it! I've made a decision. Okay, if there is a reward, Myrna and I are gonna share it with everybody. Harold! All right. Okay. All right. Now, listen! And we can all take our money... - and go crazy. - Ahhh! Harold! I might go crazy too. But if we do that, we come back, there isn't gonna be a cab company. 'Cause the bank's gonna shut us down, if Bravo doesn't do it first. So, I'm gonna ask somethin' of you, that you make an investment in D.C. Cab. You just want us to give the money back to you? - But the money's not the main issue, Dell. - Well, maybe not to you. Harold, let me ask you something. Are you saying that... - we'd be like... like partners? - Yeah. - No! Never! - [All Shouting] Come on! Hear me out! Hold it! Hold it! Hear me out! Listen, guys! This morning, we went out in the street together... as a team! If we could pool our forces, [Scoffs] we... we could pay off the loan. We could paint the cabs. Hey, man! We could get airport licenses! Yeah, we might be able to make some payoffs like Emerald does. I heard that. We could get our own jackets. Oh, jackets! I don't want no jacket. The thing is that... we would share in the profits, and we'd share in the responsibilities. If I wanted responsibility, I would've a damn sex surrogate! Yeah! Dig it, man! [All Shouting] Mister.

And the important thing is... that he's with Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee? Wait, wait. Wait a minute. You sure he said "Bruce Lee"? He's dead, you know. Uh-huh. He said Bruce Lee. That kung fu guy? Hey, you know, Bruce Lee, he ain't dead. They got him cryptonized down in Chatsworth. He's jammed in a silo and he's frozen hard as a carp. And they're gonna melt him down as soon as the economy gets better. - Thanks, Dell. - Hey, man, now that we know the farmhouse is close to the airport, let's go! Come on! Come on! Where? Where are you going? There's gotta be a hundred farms near the airport. Yeah. Samson, we should call the cops. We are in enough trouble already. Don't be stupid. You know if the cops find Albert before we do, they're gonna shoot him and ask questions later. Yeah, but wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait a minute. We don't even know where Albert is. I mean trying to find him is one thing, but trying to rescue him is something else entirely. And if we could find him, there'd be guns and kidnappers and guns. Wait a minute! We better think about this before we do something. I'm sorry, brother. I don't have a minute, so you can do what you wanna do. But I owe Albert, for helping me find the things I never had before, like pride and dignity. So I'm going out there after them, because the least I can find is my self-respect... and the most I can find is Albert and them kids. I don't know about you, but I like what I became these past few weeks, and I ain't never going back to being what I was before. Never!
