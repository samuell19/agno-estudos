This world is a jungle. Full of billions of animal. With billions of brains and thoughts. And thoughts means tensions. A deer is tensed about the tiger. And the middle class is tensed with the inflation. Rich are tensed with the tax. Businessman, with the recession. Students, with the results. Tension about the place for living. FB, Insta's like's tention Married are tensed about their wife. And the tension of shopping in the mall. Bhavesh, how's this dress? Who? Baby, I asked you how.. how's this dress? Nice. Nice. Nice. And how's this? - yes! Superb!. And how's this? Mind blowing. You're not interested. Then leave it. I don't want to shop anything. Come on, Jharana, you're always Miss World to me in any dress. All this is nothing compared to you. - Really? - Of course. Frankly speaking, I don't want to get married. Bhavesh. Bhavesh. I am here. What's this? Shall I sit here? - Sit. What are you looking at? Did you pay advance to everyone? Just now you said you don't want to get married. You can't change your plan like this. This is not right. - Bhavesh. Just kidding. Why are you getting serious? Okay, tell me. Advance? Okay. Photographer? - Done. Florist? - Dharmesh. No, no, baby, please. - No, baby. I've put him on duty in the garden from past 24 hours. He will manage. - I doubt. Go ahead. - Caterer. And priest? Done. Band? - Done. Done. Done. Canopy? Canopy? Only canopy is left. Actually, you know what.. Baby, how can you forget the canopy? No, I didn't forget. It is just missed. Baby, you know that I don't like normal canopy. Of course, you want Greek canopy. - Yes. I've already saved a wallpaper of it.. ..on my phone as a part of the preparation. Isn't it nice? - Oh so cute. So that I would remember. Superb design, isn't it? Still you forgot? What do I say? I've so many things to do. So I happen to forget. You know something? What is most important in our marriage? You and me, my love. What about the canopy? What is the use of canopy without us? What will we do without canopy? Marriage. You are not getting these things. You tell me clearly. Do you doubt about our marriage? Look, this is not done. I forgot one thing and you're doubting our marriage. Baby, tell me the truth. What else you're forgetting? This is the problem with the girls. You've already decided that.. ..I must have forgotten something else too. I've been roaming around with you in the mall.. ..for 8 hours daily from past 8 days. Do you know that? Right. You're so right. Of course. - I knew it that I will get blamed. I am going to be at fault. Look, baby. Don't get upset. Don't cry. People are watching. Listen. Listen to me. Baby, listen to me. I'm sorry I forgot about the canopy. But I haven't forgotten anything else. Right. I'm sure you wouldn't have forgotten anything.. ..about your bachelors party. I'm sure you've made advance payment for it. That can never be forgotten. But listen, I've no clue about its bookings. No. Oh, right. Yes. Your useless friends must have done that. They didn't come to use in marriage arrangements. Tell me one thing. Who throws bachelor party before marriage? Baby, it is thrown before marriage. That's why it is called bachelor's party. Look at the way, you're arguing. I'm sure your Dineshbhai must have taught you these answers. God, how's he concern now? He is. He is the one who has spoiled all of you. Do you remember what had happened last time? Happy birthday. Ladies and gentlemen. On my only son's 12th birthday today.. ..I gift him a car. A huge round of applause. This car is worth Rs.7.5 million. Take this, son. And on this auspicious day today.. My God. Here, son. Fire.. God, what are you doing? Our son is very young. And you're giving her this from now.. My wife, even the Gods needed weapons in their times of 'Satyug'. Whereas this is the 'Kaliyug'. Take this and fire. Look, Bhavesh. Now you must think and choose your company. What do you mean? For example Rehan. Your boss. So you've a problem with him as well? That man is so weird. Rehaan... Good morning, papa. - Good morning, son. Sit. Sit. How was your road trip to Abu? Mind blowing. This time we had off-road-in. And as always, I was the first one to reach. Wouldn't this off-road-in damage your bike? Papa, it's my bike. How will it damage? Running the bike will not run the house. But running the hotel will help. Now be serious. Hello, sit down. Where are you going early in the morning? I've some work. Oh work? You're not even working and still you're busy. Papa, tell mom not to worry. Listen son. I'm worried that something will happen.. ..to others because of you. Now you've grown up. Be responsible. And yes. Take care of your papa's health. And why are you quiet? Do you really think I should tell him something? Yes. Then listen. You've come from a trip so take rest for 2 days. Have a holiday. And then.. come to the hotel. Yes, papa. Is that clear? It's not good that you say such things about my friends. I am so sorry, baby. Actually, marriage pressure is so much. I just want everything to be perfect. It will be. You just relax. I can understand. Tell me, Dharma. Bhavesh. I've done a perfect setting of one girl. Your bachelors party will be hit. It will be like a fire, you know. Okay. Okay. Is it? Okay. I'm so excited over here and you.. Why are you replying like this? Jharna, it's Dharmesh. I see. So you are with sister-in-law Jharna. Yes. - Okay. Alright. Listen. She demands Rs 50000. It's worth, you see. I'd say even 1 lack will be worth. Her name is Daisy. Daisy? - Daisy? Daisy. - Wow, she's like a bomb, you know. I've no words to express. Those flowers. Florist. Didn't I tell you he's in the garden.. ..from past 24 hours. He's into that arrangements. Just a second. - I am talking to him. Give it to me. Hello. - Yes. I want lily and not daisy. Lily? I mean I've somehow arranged this. How will I go and search for Lily now? You will find it in Nanpura area. Go in the morning and don't forget to bargain. Are you sure you want me to do that? No, I mean, sister-in-law. How did you find Lily in Surat? How come you have so much knowledge? I couldn't find it. So what if I am not married. I've all the experiences in life. You just go with lily. Are you sure you want me to finalize with Lily? Of course. Are you done? Give it to me. I've something important to talk to him. Okay, we will talk in detail about all this later. Disconnect for now. No, listen, Bhavesh. Sister-in-law is so cooperative. She has so much knowledge about our matters. Yes, she is very co-operative. I wish my wife would be like her. You're a lucky guy. Okay, now hang up. Bye. Yes, okay, bye. Bye. Sister-in-law, you're too smart. Daisy. I want to make you crazy. Lovely.. May all the evils be ward off. May all the evils be ward off. May all the evils be ward off. May all the evils be ward off. Stop it now. We are going to Goa. Not to any pilgrimage place. That's why she has to do all this. You please continue, sister-in-law. Stop it, sister-in-law. This much. Brother-in-law Dinesh. You're eldest in all. So, take care of the boys. How am I going to take care of these grownups? This isn't a school picnic. Who did you say grownups? Not you. You're mad. Come on, let's go now. Bhavesh. - Yes. Listen to me. - Tell me. Is Greek canopy final? Yes, it is. Are you sure? Listen to me. See, we will get married exactly the way you want. Everything will be perfect. Thank you, baby. Hey, I forgot. I've kept our traditional snacks in your bag. With some chutneys. And listen. I've kept few pills for indigestion. Take it or else you will suffer from indigestion. Do you need to say this?

Hello. - Yes. Gajanan canopy. Well, I wanted to enquire with you. You please stop all this nonsense now. Yes. - Wait a minute, please. Ever since you've got into the car.. ..you're after that only. Disconnect it first. Just disconnect. - Just a minute. Keep the phone down first. Take his phone. Please, what all you've started with? This is something important. Important. - Important. I'm really tired of it from past few days. I don't know why Jharna is insisting on a particular canopy? What's so special about the canopy? Nothing. - Then? Just cover the four bamboos with colourful clothes. That's it. You know what? Even if you put four bamboos in a petticoat.. ..your canopy will be ready. I've seen 375 designs. - Oh. How many? - 375. Didn't you go mad? After some time I felt all the designs are same. Now which is Greek canopy.. ..and which is Russian canopy? Didn't she ask for an Italian? Leave it. You don't worry. Listen. Right now we are going to Goa. So you please concentrate on your bachelor's party. Understood? - Daisy. Concentrate on daisy. Leave your canopy's tension on me. I will take care of it. Yes.

Last time your wife was pregnant. A year before that, you got married. Dinesh, don't blame me for everything. This year.. who's responsible this year? Bhavesh's marriage. Yes, but what did we do for the rest of the years? That were wasted due to his break up. Shama's tail. From past 6 years, you're breaking up.. ..with the same girl frequently. Don't drag Shama in this. Then whom shall we? Look, we are 29 now. When will we go? At least start from Ladakh. I'm always ready. I will sponsor. Hey, quiet. Quiet. This year it is not possible. We will think about it next year. I am going to get married in 2 days. There are lots of things to manage. Bhavesh. Marriage reminds me.. ..that you.. Do you have any brother-in-law? No. Not at all. You're really lucky. Seriously. You're very lucky. You know how many brothers-in-law I have? Eight. - Really? Eight. - Really? What's it after seven? Eight brothers-in-law. I wish your father-in-law had put in more efforts.. ..then he'd have a cricket team today. It's not my father-in-law's cup of tea. I mean.. jokes apart. But you know what? My brothers-in-law. Brothers-in-law grand fun. What's this? - A whatsapp group. Brothers-in-law grand fun. Grand fun. You know, every morning I start getting messages.. ..like an alarm. Messages after messages. Happiness and sorrows are not in mind.. What was it? I forgot that message. - Yes. Happiness and sorrows are not based on the circumstances. Rather it is in your mind. Dinesh. Daily I get such messages. Just imagine my circumstances and mental condition. Just a minute. I've recently got a photo of Sai-baba, of the time 1918. See. Had you seen this earlier? Delete it. Delete it.. You can't.. You can't delete. - Why? They literary get on your nerves. I've to send this photo to 108 people. And you know what the problem is? My phonebook has only 100 contacts.

Whatever is in your life is in this moment. Seriously. Listen to me. Life.. After marriage, you will feel monotony in life. Monotony? Yes. Monotony. - Monotony. Your routine is fixed after that. To the extent that you go to the office in the morning.. ..come back in the evening and then go to sleep. Watch serial and sleep. No bikes, no jackets. Once you get married.. ..your entire life will become a marry-go-round. Stop it now. Enough. Don't scare me. Tell me what's the update about the Greek canopy? Any progress? You're still stuck there? I will do it. Don't worry. I will finalize it. - Final? Final. Shake hands with me. - Okay, final. You just ruined it, Bhavesh. What happened, Jharna? Which canopy is this? I had told you Greek canopy. Then what's this? This isn't that. Mom, he has given his best. And whatever had to happen has happened. No. This isn't their problem. This is middle class mentality. How will they understand what Greek canopy is? For the sake of girl. What difference does it make if the canopy is different? You won't have to spend your life here. After marriage, you will go home. Bhavesh. This is not done, Bhavesh. You changed the design of the canopy.. ..and you didn't even tell me. I am.. I am sorry, Jharna. All this has happened due to that useless. Dinesh. What? That canopy builder ditched us at the last moment. I had told you. But you would never listen. Everything is over now. It's over. - Nothing is over, Jharna. Listen, baby. It's just a canopy. Correct. For you it is only a canopy. But it was my dream. You've just spoiled my marriage. What did you see. Okay, listen. I've spoiled it, right? Then I will only correct it, okay? How? You want to make it special, right? It's too late, Bhavesh. What happened? - Okay. I don't drink.. - Take it. Dinesh. - What? Look at that girl in pink dress. You can woo her but you need to have.. ..a courage to talk to her. This isn't your cup of tea. So just give up. Challenge? Are you challenging me? - Yes. This is a challenge. Dinesh. Now this is on my ego. I told you. You can't woo her. You go and take care of your child. Just a minute. Take this. Hold it. You take care of my son. I will take care of this girl. Watch me. Sorry.

It's me. I am sorry brother. I thought it is Dhamo. Yes of course I'm Dhamo. Dharmesh Dholakiya. Not you. This he-buffalo tied on the nail. Even his name is Dhamo? - Yes. He gets released every night. And then troubles these buffalos. - Doesn't let them sleep. And listen. he's a number one drunkard. I've kept this stick for him. Dhama. Our problem is similar. I can understand your pain. Same pinch. You're also suffering like me. You are not getting anything in the shed. And I'm not getting anything at home. Tell me. Do you even know how much does it affect our business? Why are you talking about business all the time. What's your problem if a he-buffalo is getting.. ..a chance to spend time with buffalos. This Dhama's fate is so bad even at shed.. ..and also at home. Indian mentality. You people should be made to run on the streets. You stay in your limit. Or else I will beat you up. Tell me why did you come here? Give me your milk. I mean give buffalo milk. You won't get it. Do what you can. Don't do that. My kid is crying at home. I mean my son has woken up. And he will not sleep without drinking milk. - Please try and understand. Go. Dhamo is your dear. So it will give you. Go and milk it. Is this the time to make fun? Will the he-buffalo give milk? Listen. Sorry. Charge double. But give me milk. I plead at you. Please. That's better. Talk to me decently. Otherwise, I will lose my temper. Everyone loses temper over here. At home my wife, in office my clients. Rehan at his house. And here, this milkman. The day I will lose my temper, Dhama. I will solve our problem. You just see... Are you back, brother-in-law? - Yes. What are you all doing here? Are you here to spend a wakeful night? No, brother-in-law. Sister has called us. There's an emergency. Brother-in-law has gone. We've fooled him. Purvi. Purvi. Hey, Ramesh. Suresh. What was the emergency? Hi.. hi, brother-in-law. Actually, we came to give the milk.. ..as it was over. I see. So you also give milk. Also supply some drink. What smell is this? - What smell is this? Smell? Sister. Sister. What.. what's all this? Why are you shouting at midnight? So sweet. But milk is here. Lalo drank it and has slept. Is it so? Yes, I understood when I saw your brothers. What? Behave. Every time he will give names to my brothers. Lalo had his milk. And he has slept. Now you also go home and sleep. Okay? Go. Just a minute. Sister. Message us if you need anything. Are you alright? Yes, I am. Now go. Goodnight. Bye, brother-in-law. - Yes, come less. Purvi. Purvi. - Yes. What? What's it? Why did you ask them to get the milk? I had gone to buy it. You're not trustworthy, Dharmesh. Once if you leave home, it's never sure.. ..when you will come back. That's why for a safe side, I called them. Anyway, Dharmesh. Every time they've come to help in emergency. They don't have any other work. They are always guarding our house. With a grocery shop. Anything you require. Just give a call. And they are immediately here. It's your fault. Yes, it's your fault. Why should I give them a call? Because you're not taking the responsibility. Dharmesh, we are married. We've a child. Still, you're behaving like a kid. Kid. Is life over because we've a kid now? You think over it. Think over it. When did we spend a quality time.. ..with each other after we got the kid? I know what you mean by this quality time. Generally, after marriage our priorities change. My priority is our child. Lalu. And even yours should be the same. Be a responsible father. For whom did I go and buy milk in the midnight? Your responsibilities are not proved in just one night? So I am not a responsible father, right? Dharmesh, you're not responsible at all. Rest everything is not to be discussed. You mean to say I've not done anything. Right? Hey. - I'm wasting time here. Enough. - What enough? Ok. I'm leaving this house. I will come back when you will realize my value. Dharmesh, how can you directly jump.. ..on the conclusion for everything? Did I jump on the conclusion? But I didn't mean that. I understand what you mean. Now, I will do it. Now, I will come back to this house.. ..only when you need me. Okay, fine. Go, I will see who tolerates you more then two days. Thank you. - Thank you. At your service, ma'am. Oh, thank you. You're most welcome. So? - So? You seem to be in mood today. I get into the mood the moment I see you. Is it? Are you flirting with me ? No, I actually mean it. Okay. Thank you. So? - So? How's married life? Frankly speaking, the life has become monotonous. Same routine. Get up in the morning. Take breakfast, go to the office. And return to the same house. I had thought of something else. - And something else is happening. I've lost that spark from my life. But.. Whenever I meet you I feel really alive. I feel happy. So, thank you. Thank you for bringing that spark back into my life. I can understand, Bhavesh. You know what? I've many friends who are not happy after marriage. Because.. they got married in hurriedness. Without waiting to find the right person. Oh hello! You became serious. No no, I was just thinking. Okay, listen. Whenever you feel you've lost the spark in life.. ..you meet me. Simple. I'm here. And.. Even if you flirt with me.. ..I wouldn't mind. Hi, hero. Tell me, my heroine. What's the matter? Oh, these days you keep very busy. And you go on the bike in the office. - Yes. Your entire look has changed. - Yes. Tell me. Is there any affair? Everything for you, darling. Really? - Of course. I mean it is for us. See. I work more in the office for ourselves. I go on the bike swiftly. So that I can spend more time with you. And.. these clothes.. They are just like that. You must have heard my name. Rahul. You're not romantic at all. So? My princess. My baby, I love you. I love you too, baby. Okay, I'm very hungry. Will you serve me something? - Come on. Okay, and listen. Flatbread will do. - Drama. Australian fry fish please. Okay. What have you started with now? Turn off your bike engine. I will tell you. - I've some urgent work. Tell me. - I've left home. Did sister-in-law throw you out? My case is not like yours and Shama. I've left home. I'm busy, tell me what you want. Take me home. Whose? - I called you up. So naturally you should take me to your house. Come on. Look at me. I'm so sad. I've not eaten homemade food from many days. You're always sad. And this food is good. This will spoil my stomach. Come on, I left home counting on you. Stop. Hey. You go dinesh bhai's home will meet their. Where do you live? - At home. Do they cook in your house? Thank you. Rehan. - What Rehan? Why don't you receive my call? What's your problem? Why are you following me? I want to speak to you. Shama, I'm.. I am what? I am.. - What? I am sorry? Huh? I am sorry for my behaviour. I can't live without you. I will die without you. Anything else? Do you have to say anything else? Rehan, please. Please, Rehan, please. This is your routine now. And even if I am convinced, what next? What next? As it is. Same behaviour. Same anger. That's it. Why don't you understand? I will die without you. Any problem? What's he doing here? You're a problem. - Rehan. Look, Rehan. This is my life. I will live the way I want. I will do what I want. You need not interfere. Just spare me. You know you're a witch ? Hey, mind your language. What do you mean? What will you do? What will you do? Rehan. Get lost. Go. Go, Rehan. Go. I will die without you. Remember this. Die if you wish to. And live if you wish to. But spare me. Henceforth you will not see me alive. See me for one last time. See me last time. Die if you wish to. And live if you wish to. But spare me. Die if you wish to. And live if you wish to. But let me free. Come on... Come on. Kill me. Do you wish to die? Come on. - Move away. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Hey, idiot. Why did you come in front of my rickshaw? I wanted to die by colluding with a car. But your rickshaw came in front of me. Go away. Come on. Let's go. Listen, son. No one dies by meeting accident with rickshaw. You just do as I say. Why are you getting excited? I've sure shots. Are you suicide consultants? You can think so. My friends calls me suicide Sandy. Suicide Sandy. - I'm very expert. I've tried committing suicide a lot of time. Still you're alive? First time when I failed in 12th class.. ..then I tried to hang myself on the fan. But fan fell off on me. And I had got 24 stitches. Then? Then.. it was too bad in the end. In the end, it was too bad. I got married, had a family with kids. But I was so poor what do I say? I had no money to meet our needs. I thought of giving poison to my family and take it myself. But when I tried to give them poison.. ..I thought it's not their fault. It's my fault. I could not do my business well. So I immediately called up few creditor. And promised them to return their money.. ..by working hard. Then you can see how I am doing. It's no use committing suicide. Would you have benefited by committing suicide? Not at all. You must muster courage. And progress in life. Everyone feels in depression. But that time passes away. Are you getting it? Come on. 8,9 and 10 card. Now tell me what went wrong with you and Purvi? You haven't won. Will you tell me or want me to call up Purvi and ask? I don't want to talk about it. If you don't like me staying here.. ..then I will leave. I don't mind. - Guys. Guys. What's wrong with him? There's a problem. - What's the problem? Shama had called up. He must have created a scene again. It's his routine. Do you want me to make a peg for you? Sit down. This is a routine I agree. But Shama doesn't call up every day, does she? Today, there was a big chaos. Shama slapped him. And he left from there warning her that he will die. What? - I was.. What? - He said he will die and left from there. I'm trying to contact him but his phone is not reachable. Listen, has anyone of you talked with him? No. Call him up. Call him up, Dinesh. How can he do this to me? Call him up. What's wrong with you? Why are you in a hurry? I've to take Rs.10,000 from him. Are you a landlord or a friend? Landlord. Have you lost it? He's about to kill himself and you're worried about your money. I've lost my money. You're useless. Now think of what to do. - Just a minute. Shall we observe silence to pay homage? He isn't dead. - Then why isn't he receiving your call? I am trying to call him up. Keep quiet. Hey, Rehan is here. He is here. He is here. - Behave normal. Behave normal. As if nothing has happened. Yes, normal. As if nothing has happened. Rehan. Come in, the door is open. Sit down. Sit down. My money will be recovered now. Don't overact. - No, I am not. Behave normally. Normal. Take your cards. Rehan, come, the game is on. My cards are already shuffled. Moment I opened the card it was pack up. What is he saying? He's talking about committing suicide in your house. You're in a fix, Dinesh. No, you just shut up. - Quiet. He won't do anything like that. You just keep quiet. Why are you scaring him? I've so many land deals pending and he is.. Don't worry, he won't do anything. You.. Where is he going? - Ask him. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Fridge is switched off. Hey, there's light inside. So the electricity is restored. What do you want? I will take whatever I want. Dinesh. - Yes. He's talking about a knife. He will stab himself in your kitchen with your knife. I will lose my money but you will get jailed. Relax. Nothing of that sort will happen. Just relax. - He is going to commit suicide. No, listen. Whatever you take show me once. Dinesh, in the kitchen.. I don't have knives. There're no knives. I've given them to the trash. Why? Astrologer told me not to keep sharp object at home. So I gave it away. Knife.. - Even the kerosene is not at home. Sister-in-law, threw it away. Dinesh had it once mistaking it as cold drink. You are... and your habit.. I'm having alcohol, that's why... Not kerosene, I was.. - Rat killing powder? Even that is not there. Actually, his neighbor had a cat.. ..that ate all the rats from Dinesh's house. I want milk. Milk? Milk? What does he want to do with milk? What will he do with the milk? I think he has found a new stuff to kill himself. Let's stop all the dairy items. Why do you want milk now? Why do you want milk? I want to make some tea. Tea. Tea, coffee, cold drink. Nothing is at home. There's liquor. Have it. You know I don't drink. You know that I don't drink tea. Where are you going this way? To the toilet. - Alone? We are sitting here. And you will alone go to the toilet. I go to the toilet alone since the age of 5. Any problem? How much time you will take? What's the problem with you? Because I also want to go. Please hurry up. Go, irritating guy. Why did you allow him to go? What do I do? This is nature's call? How can I stop him? What nature? What if he will do something inside? What we can do? He might drink acid or phenyl. You will be in a fix. Come on, let's go. You.. What do you think, Dinesh? Any card I will have. What's your concern? What about you, Bhavesh? Dhama. Why don't you do the show? You know this is my style. People play blind. I play open. This is the style. Actually.. I want to make a confession. Today, I had gone to commit suicide. But.. But life taught me something new. Instead of ending the life.. ..it's better to face the problems. From tomorrow onwards, my new life begins. No Shama. No fighting. Only biking. And all of us will go to Ladakh trip. On the bike. That's the spirit, my boy. That's the spirit. "You're in my mind, in my body." "You're in every pores of me." "You're in my mind, in my body."

Bye. Okay. Bye. Who was on phone? My school friend. School friend. Which is your school friend whom I don't know? Is it necessary that you know all my friends? No, right? Now listen carefully. Tonight I've to go to a party with her. If Jharna asks you, tell her that I'm with you. Okay. Done? You will not be with me. But if Jharna asks me I should say that you're with me. You're intelligent. - OF course. I will not do that. - Why? I will not do that. I'm not your friend anymore. You threw me out of your house. Then why will I support you? Dharma you feel bad over small things. Who told you to throw you out? I just asked you how many days you will stay here. Accordingly, we will do the hospitality. You can stay here and enjoy. No one is stopping you. But take care that Jharna wouldn't come to know about this. And listen. You do your setting outside until I return home. I will be alone and you will be alone. I wish you get such school friends every day. Lucky guy. Go and enjoy. Dharmesh is here. No fear. Hello. - Mamma. There's a good news. You're going to be a grand-mom. What are you saying?

We are going to be three very soon. And you.. What happened? Why do you appear shocked? Are you not happy? No, it's nothing like that. Why do you say that? Of course, I am very happy. Congratulations to you, too. But I am tensed. About what? Most of the research says that when a wife is pregnant.. ..man gets into extra-marital relationships. Is it? Research also says that most of the women.. ..in their pregnancy stage become demanding. Yes, actually, the baby in her womb demands. So, the other person must fulfil it. Did you get it? - Done. Even the men will have the demands.. ..only when the circumstances were such. Maybe that's why they get into extra marital relationship. It's not that only one person is at fault. Bhavesh. Did you ever have any such demand? I will kill you if it ever happens. You know I cannot share you, right? What happened? You're so scared. I know that you will never come up with any such demand. I've complete faith on you. I trust you, baby. Shall we go now? Let's go. Cool place. - I know. - Superb place. Why did you suddenly come here? Just like that. Is everything alright? - Yes, what will happen? Okay. So, let's talk about something. About what? About us. About us? - Hmm.. What? About us.. about the two of us. About this moment. Look, there's no one between us over here. There's no one between us.? Hey, that's my favorite song. Let's go. Let's go. Come. - Yeah. Bhavesh is too much. He was supposed to go with Dharmesh. Make it delicious. Yes. Hello. Where are you? - I've come here to eat eggs. And where's Bhavesh? He is gone somewhere Okay, so he is not with you? No. Okay, listen. I've cooked fresh food. For whom? For you. - For me? Yes. Not possible. Really? Then hang up now. I will be there in ten minutes. Yes. I will be there. Hang up. Pack this. It will come to use on the way. Hurry up. Wow, it's so tasty. It's very delicious. I enjoyed it a lot. Where's Bhavesh? He has gone with his friend. Some girl. Which friend? I don't know. So the two of you were not supposed to go together. No. So you had lied to me, right? Tell me the truth. Tell me where he has gone. Who's that girl? Did I say that it is a girl? Don't you remember? Really? Oh no. - Tell me. Who are you trying to call up? - Leave it. You're calling up Bhavesh, right? I want to speak to him. I want to speak to him. - Please. Please, I really don't know who that girl is. I'm trying to call him up but he is not receiving my call. Jharna, please. Don't drag me in your fight. Don't you dare. - Sister-in-law. Quietly sit inside until Bhavesh returns home. But.. Quietly.. - He will kill me.. Otherwise, you will find me worse. Go inside. - Sister-in-law.. Quiet. Go inside. - Sister-in-law. Listen to me, sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. - Quiet. - Sister-in-law. He will kill me ... There it is. What happened? I can't do this. What? We must stop here, Nisha. I am married. Until now everything was right for you, Bhavesh. Suddenly you felt it is wrong? Tell me what I should do. No, Nisha. It's not your fault. I've committed a mistake. I had become selfish. I forgot that I've some responsibilities. I forgot that I have to return home to someone. O God, what have I done? I am sorry. But, Nisha, now.. ..I've realized that none of us will live happy with this. Neither you, me nor Jharna. This relation has no future. So there's no point going ahead. I am sorry. But henceforth we won't meet. What do you think of yourself? You will take all the decisions? Did I come to you begging for love? What do you think I am? No, Nisha. I didn't mean that. Please. Please, don't get me wrong. Look, I'm really sorry. If you want you can hit me. Hit me. Just hit me. Hit me. I'm responsible for all this. But don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. It's not.. I accept any punishment you give me. Bhavesh. Bhavesh, chill. Hello. I was joking, okay. You're so new. What? - Listen. I knew that you're married. Then this was going to happen someday. It happened today. Big deal. And it's not your fault entirely. It's mine as well. What's your fault? - Of course. I should have stopped myself. Today I've realized one thing, Bhavesh. In life, if we like someone.. ..it is not necessary that that person is right for us. Don't worry. I know you're right. I will come out of it. I'm little hurt but.. I will come out. Okay? Have a good life. No hard feelings. Take care. What's the problem, Jharana? Where were you? So many calls and so many messages. What's the matter? Where were you? Why do you ask? I had told you that I'm going with Dharmesh. Then why do you ask? Are you sure? Do you want to ask anything else? Yes. Come out. - Yes. You can't keep anything secret. Talk to me. She had threatened to kill me. You don't know my situation. I am going. You stay here. Let me go. I don't want to get into your fights. Sorry.. such a big.. All the best. You lied to me, right? Jharna, please. Look at me and talk to me. Where did you go at night? Now don't give any excuses. Tell me the truth. Tell me where did you go? For the party. With whom? Tell me, Bhavesh. Bhavesh, please tell me. - Nisha. Who's she? - A friend. From when do you know her? A day, a week or a year? We just met, Jharana. And you started partying with her. So what? Why are you stretching the matter to this extent? If it was a trivial matter.. ..why didn't you tell me about it first? Oh. Okay. Okay. I am asking you one last question. I hope you will give me an honest reply. Has anything happened between you two? Anything physical? Please answer me, Bhavesh. Nothing has happened between us. Have some faith. I don't trust you anymore. I just cannot trust you. Today.. just today we got the good news. That we are going to be three very soon. And you went to party with that girl. I had told you. I had told you that I can't share you with anyone else. Tell me. Listen to me, Jharana. You're misunderstanding me. Nothing such has happened between us. I don't want to listen to anything. Oh. Right. You were bored of your routine wife and life, right? Go. Go and enjoy. Enjoy your adventurous life. Now, I can't stay here. And don't ever show me your face. Jharana. Jharana. Listen to me. Nothing has happened between us. I've come back to you. Rehan. Bhavesh. Bhavesh. This is common. Don't worry. Your only fault is that you're caught. I was caught because of you. Please calm down. You eat so much the entire day. But you can't keep a secret. Besides, staying in my house, you've ruined my life. My life is ruined. I don't understand what to do. Dinesh. He's asking us what to do. You want to seek pleasure from two ways. And now asking us for advice. You're a lucky guy. Just enjoy. You've two options. Jharana and Nisha. Dharma, stay in your limit. Relax. Both of you, keep quiet. What's all this? What did I say? Leave all this. Let's go to Ladakh. You've only one solution for everything. Run away. You don't know to face the problems. Very true. Very true? You've left your wife and son.. ..and living in other's house. And you say that he is correct? I know where I want to go and what I want to do. Your problem is that you want to.. ..go away somewhere. You got a boil, let's go to Goa. You got a headache. Let's go to Daman. You had a breakup, let's go to Ladakh. You need to have the courage to face the problems. Which you don't have, Rehan. He's right. - Exactly. What do you know about the problem? You had ancestral land. You sold it and made money. And spent it. Do you know what real problem mean? Yes, I've money. So I am spending. It's not that rich do not have problems. But they don't go out to commit suicide like you. You don't even accept your mistake. What mistake I've committed? I'll accept it only if I've committed a mistake. What mistake I've committed? All I say is that we all need a break. And nothing is left at this place. Leave all this and let's go to Ladakh. You need a break. Don't include me. These two might need a break. Got it? But I don't want it. I've understood with whom I should go ahead in life. Who's more important for me. And I've committed a mistake so I will accept it. I will face it. I'm ready to go through any punishment. I will not leave Jharana and go. You can go if you want. Let him go. I'm going to Ladakh even if no one comes. Okay, so let's try even this. Naturally, I will have to come with you all. I've no other option. Tell me. When to go to Ladakh. Tomorrow morning. Hey, Rehan, bike is there. Want to go walking? I won't come walking. Even I won't come. Jharana. Stop there. Don't even come near me. Jharana, listen to me, please. I've committed a mistake, Jharana. I don't want to listen. I've come to seek your apology. Jharna, please. Listen to me just once. It's late. It's too late. It's not, Jharana. Before it is too late, give me one chance. I said I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to listen to you. Let me clarify once. - Please. Didn't you listen to my daughter? She doesn't wish to listen to you. - Nor do we need to understand anything. You please go from here. You please go from here. Rehan. Shama. - Rehan, please. This is office. Don't create any scene over here. I will not do anything.. ..that will make you feel embarrass. I just wanted to meet you for one last time before I go. Tell me. Shama. Actually, it was my fault. I was getting angry thinking why you're going away from me. What was my fault? But.. Maybe.. maybe.. ..my love for you was so immense that.. ..I forgot the difference between behave and misbehave. When you slapped me in public.. ..then I realized how you must be feeling.. ..when I used to misbehave with you. I am.. I am sorry. It was my fault. Shama, I'm going to Ladakh. I don't know where I will go from there. But.. But I will not return to this city. This city has snatched away a lot of things from me. Not now. Rehan, you won't be able to see.. ..what you have. Anyway, it's better for you that you go. Our memories. If I will keep this with me, I will not be able.. ..to detach myself from you. You keep this and I will.. I am.. I am sorry. What? What's your plan? Ladakh. I'm going to Ladakh. I will return once you realize my value. Dharmesh.. Why don't you understand? I know you more than you know your self. 2 days. 2 days. You can't stay away from this house.. ..for more than 2 days. I've decided to go to Ladakh. Dharmesh, look, Lalu is our child. He's very young, Dharmesh. Try to understand. If he won't see you for some time.. ..he will stop recognizing you. Why do you look at the apple? - I'm talking to you. Look at me, please. Please, I'm talking to you. Look, Dharmesh. Listen. I agree. I know I've become very possessive.. ..about the child. Too possessive. But.. I.. love you. No. You don't. If you wish to live alone, why did you get married? Dharmesh, please. Listen. Look, I.. Dharmesh, listen. Marriage means understanding.. ..each other, think about each other. How can you think about yourself only? Talk something? May I go? Alright. Good. You've taken a decision, right? Good. But if you really wish to run away from your responsibilities.. ..then I will not stop you. Let me see how far you can run away. Thank you. Even I am tired. You will take a break. Right? So, go ahead. This is going to be the best trip ever. Goodbye, Surat. Thank you for everything. Now I leave all this fights and tussles for you. Not anymore. Goodbye, Surat. Goodbye. Shall we go? Yes. We bid farewell. Hello. Look at it Farther is dead inside and look at him. Go brother ... go inside. father Father. How are you Dharmesh. Is your son alright now? What.. what happened to him? Don't you know? He's hospitalized. Thank you. Mom, give me cash. Cash? No, you won't get it. Mom, give me cash Rs.1000. 1000? Your papa has spoiled you. Mummy, give me cash. Tiku, I said you will not get any cash. And it's final. Mummy, give cash otherwise.. Go away. Don't get on my nerves. Mummy, give me cash or I will press the trigger. Look, son. This is not a toy. Give me cash. Tiku, this isn't something to play with. Take the gun away. Take it away. Take it. Give me cash. - Tiku, this isn't a toy. Take it away, son. Take it away. - Hey. Will you kill your mom? Will you? Will you show her a gun? You want to kill your mom? Want to kill your mom? Did you see the outcome of over pampering? Today he was about to kill me. Papa, it's not my fault. This isn't your fault. It's my fault. I always ran after money. But never valued my real wealth at home. No one will be as poor as me in this world. I'm apologizing for my behavior of 14 years. If possible, forgive me. No, please don't make me a sinner. Now you've realized. That in any era, man needs a true companion.. ..and not any weapon. - Yes. Now, I.. I have understood. Hey, come here. Say sorry to mummy. - Sorry. My son. What has happened to him? He had a fever. Now, he is fine. Sorry. Now.. I will never go away. Did you eat anything? Who will feed me without you? You need not run away from life.. ..so as to understand it. Everything is right here. In front of you. Now, all the quality time will be for you. For Lalu. Rehan. Your papa had told me to give this mobile to you.. ..when you come back. Hi, champion. How are you? From a long time, I wanted to.. ..tell you something. Every time I tried to say something.. ..you got angry and left home. In your language, you call it rejection. And in our language we call it an escape. Son, even the life is like your ride to Ladakh. Clutch, brake and gear. If they are in right combination.. ..life runs smoothly on track. Ride to life has begun, son. Change your thinking. In your language, change your gear position. Change gear. Shift from bike to life. - Come back to life. Even that is a biggest ride. And listen. If there's anything like heaven.. ..then we will meet again. I will remember you in prayers. You also remember me. Have a safe ride, son. I love you. Love you, my boy. Bhavesh, where are we going? You please drop me home. Jharana, come with me for one last time. I want to show you something. From the point my mistakes started.. ..from that point onwards.. ..I want to begin with you afresh. Will you marry me.. ..again. And now, I've also built a Greek canopy. I am sorry. Everyone has their own problems and difficulties in life Life is sometimes sweet and sometimes sour The real fun of the sweetness and sourness in life is When we all are with our family Did you hear this? There's nothing in life except a family. And we are nothing without the family. We realized it lately. But you don't get late. Go.. go and tell your family how much you love them. Go.
