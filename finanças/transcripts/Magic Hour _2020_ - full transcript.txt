Subtitles by OnDemandKorea Nam-woo, get a nice shot today! Get the front! Okay? Magic Hour How have you been Nam-woo? Why are you eating ramen at this hour? It's not good for you. We bought your favorites, yukgaejang and gomtang. I'm done. Dad. We're thinking of opening a bakery. A neighbor gave me this opportunity because he's moving out of the country. It gets good sales. It's very nice. I see. Good luck. So I was thinking... Why don't you let go of this place now? Is that what you came here for? You know that's not it. I'm just trying to do a good job. It's time you admit it now too. No one takes film photography these days. Yes Nam-woo. Everyone has their own digital cameras and phones. No one pays for photos anymore now. It's a waste of money. It's a digital era now. Dad! We need to sell this so I can provide for my family! It's been three years. I was just busy with life! I know you don't like me, but I'm still your father! Mrs. Kim, 65 years old, lives by herself in a basement of a store. She makes her living picking up waste. She can't even afford a $100 rent. But none of her 4 children are taking care of her. Anyway, my son is begging me to quit work. He's just saying it's a good time for you to retire. Saying it's time to retire is the problem! Why do they get to decide when it's time for me to leave? Just the thought of it is sobering me up. Same with your kid. How can he come after all these years and say that to you? Don't give him the store. Hold your ground no matter what. You'll end up like that old lady if you don't have money or a home at this age. I'm not sure what to do. Is it because you still feel bad about what happened? It's already been 10 years. You even got him married. You did more than enough. He used to never talk to me. It must be really bad since he showed up to tell me that. And I wonder if I need to do that to make it up to him. Give it a careful thought so you don't have regrets. The kids don't do anything for you when they're all grown up. They're busy living their own lives. Are you already drunk? Kim Nam-woo, you've gotten weak. I'm just a little tired. I know! You should exercise and eat good food. You have to take care of yourself! Nam-woo, your hand! Does it hurt? It's nothing. - Here, let me do it. - No, it's okay. When are you guys going to leave? There's nothing to do really back at home. So we're going to stay a few more days. Your hands keep shaking, right? It will be followed by stiffness and slowness of movement. I think it's Parkinson's Disease. The MRI shows loss of memory and weakening of the cerebrum. I think you also have Alzheimer's. Excuse me, but could you take a picture for us? Here. One, two, three. - Thank you. - Sure. - Thank you. - Hey! I can hear you losing money all the way from here. When did you get here? You're not working today? Pack your bags so we can go. Let's go to Mr. Kang's funeral. Mr. Kang is dead? He looks good. Nam-woo, can you take mine too? He lived alone with Alzheimer's. He had such a lonely life. But his son is here. I heard he showed up after a week. The pictures look nice. Oh my... Honey, this is a picture of your mother, right? - This one. - Who? That's my mom. She must've been happy here. Let's not talk about my mom. But it seems like your dad regrets it now. Damn it! No more. I don't even want to look at my dad when I think about that. Fine. By the way, I think your dad is sick. He was fine just 3 years ago though... Why do you always get so worked up when we talk about your mother? He doesn't even deserve to have a picture of my mom! My mom died because of he couldn't trust her! He killed her. He's a hypocrite. He's a hypocrite who killed my mom! How could you say that? Your dad doesn't seem healthy either. You nee to let it go now. I took a picture at the temple couple of years ago. I heard I can get it from here. What's your name? It's Han Jung-Rae. Is it there? Here it is! I put aside the photos that were returned to me. You're Han Jung-Rae from Seoul, right? Yes, that's me! It's been almost 40 years since I've lived with him. This is the only picture we have together. He'll remember me if he sees this picture, right? My husband has Alzheimer's. So he can't remember things. - But if he sees this... - Of course. I'm sure he'll remember you. Thank you so much for not throwing the photo away. I hope he'll remember me. I'm sure he will. Why would they take the picture and not collect it? They must have a lot of money. The pictures look great! You take amazing pictures. Dad, it's really going to be great this time. If you help me just this once... Please help me dad. Are you finished? Please do it for mom... Don't talk about your mother. How can you do this to me?! Don't you have a conscience? - Honey. - Don't you feel guilty? - Stop it. - Who made mom die? Whose fault is it?! Honey, you need to stop. Let's go. This store isn't yours. It's actually mom's! Mom is the one who worked hard to open it. Why are you sitting there? - Tell me! - Honey! - You can't talk this way to your father! - "Father?" He's not my father! He doesn't deserve to be! Honey! I think it's time for me to leave. What's going on? You called me at such a late hour. Do you want me to take your portrait? No thanks. Taking a portrait makes me depressed. Why does the place look so messy? I'm going to sell it. Did you win the lottery or something? Yes, I'm going to Hawaii without you and enjoy my life. What's going on all of a sudden? It's a good time for me to leave. - Did someone say it is? - You. Let's open the bottles you brought. Cheers. Nam-woo, I'm going to go. Jo Hang-man, thank you for the drinks. See you tomorrow. Alright, smile slightly. Say cheese. Dear son. I hope you can forgive me. During my whole lifetime... I've never forgotten the bruise on my heart and have lived every day in misery. It's a torture to be living with a delusional jealousy for my wife. I neglected my family and only focused on photography the whole time. Please forgive me for not being there for you. And I hope you'll take care of this photo as however you like it. Excuse me. Yes? Do you know this person? Oh this man! He'll be at the park over there. - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. Do you know why a flying bird drops from the sky? It's because it lacks stamina! For those who try to get it on and have to retreat quickly! Just try this medicine! The kids can go home! Your reaction is as cold as this weather. Pay up guys! Good work! Dang it, I got nothing today again. Who are you? Why are you taking a picture without my permission? Pay up if you want to take a picture of me. I've been on cable and main channels. You're Hwang Dal-joo, right? That was a funny kid. He came to me at that young age and told me I was his father. The story will take 4 days to tell. But basically he kept asking his mother who his father was. And she just told him I was his father. So he's not your son? I wondered why she told him that too. But since I'm an entertainer moving around, I guess she thought he wouldn't be able to find me. But he found me somehow! I was so speechless at first. But he was... What do you call that... More friendly than a typical kid. And I thought his mother must've had no other options. So I just thought that I would pretend to be his father. And I took him to the temple and got a few shots taken... And then what happened? He did send me a letter before I moved. But we lost contact because I can't stay in one place for long. Anyway, I wonder how old he is now. Why are you doing this anyway? Are you trying to wrap up your life? I think this photo should be sent to him. Do you know his address? I told you he sent me a letter before I moved. I think I may have it stashed somewhere in my house. I'll look for it and let you know. Give me your number. What's wrong? You don't have a phone? Where are you sleeping tonight? My gosh, look at this man! You don't have any plans, do you? Why are you touching my stuff? There are a lot of pictures that haven't been collected. You're going to deliver every single one of them? Fine, fine. I'll be nice. You can come to my house tonight. Oh and we look like we're about the same age. - So I'll use an informal tone with you. - You've already started. That's right. That's just how life is. Hey buddy, you pay for dinner. It's up here. What do you think? This is my studio. Isn't it luxurious? I installed all of these lights. I'm saying all of Seoul is mine. Of course you're taking pictures. You can't help yourself, huh? As I told you before, the kid in the picture is really not mine. You know what a vasectomy is, right? I got it because I didn't want to receive reserve forces training. So how could I have a kid? Give me a second, I'm going to go look for a picture of that woman. Look here, this shows my whole life story touring around the country. Look. The woman I should thank for giving me a son I don't really have. - She's pretty. - She wasn't clingy either. She's what they call these days, a cool girl. She didn't know who the father was either. So I bet that's why she just picked me. You haven't met the kid after that time he came to you? How could I meet him? I moved right after too. This is my 8th home already. You should've gone to see him. Don't you feel bad for him? Why would I go see him? He's not my real son. Hold on, I think I put it in this album somewhere. I think he was from Daejeon... Daejeon? I'm too drunk right now to be sure. I'll look for the letter later. I'll show you something awesome since you're here. Hold on. Medicine of miracle! This one is for curing a hangover. You don't need it since you don't really drink. I bet you need this. Do you know what this is? I've tried it, and it's amazing. You won't be lonely. Here, buy it. I'll give it to you cheap. Is this why you brought me here? - My goodness... - Hey, I'm a messenger of happiness. I make a flower blossom on a tree. You're not totally helpless, right? It must be nice to live young. I don't have any money saved up. I have to do this for a living at this age. Please just help me. Don't look too far to find someone in need to help. All my customers are satisfied! That's precious! This is my real baby. Want me to clean your ears? But it's late... You bastard! Let me sleep! This damn neighborhood doesn't let me make art! Anyway... You're a master at photography, right? You have time tomorrow, right? It will only take a second. You know who Audrey Hepburn is, right? Audrey Hepburn? What do you think? Isn't she pretty? Yeah. She's very pretty. She used to be an actress! I heard she was a supporting role who was like a main character. But I guess the movie was a fail. A fail? You're so behind on the lingo! That's what the kids say these days. It means it didn't do well. They also say things like "snack," "bae," and "wifey." So you like her a lot. So take a few shots of us at somewhere nice and stay one more day. You have to pay me back for letting you sleep at my house. I never asked you to do that. You know what I'm talking about, right? Let's go. Hey Eun-nyeo, I'm here. This is my friend, and he's an artist. He received first place 9 times at different photo competitions. I paid a lot to have him here to take pictures of you. He's a very busy man. Mr. Kim, let me see that thing. What? Why are you so oblivious? The picture you took of me! Is it in here? Hold on. The pictures of me... What? You have an album? Eun-nyeo, he was busy traveling abroad for pictures but he came here to do me a favor. What do you think? Aren't they amazing? They're awesome, right? Don't you feel a tug in your heart? You can feel the sadness. I think it matches your vibe. A bit of solitude and melancholy... You only took pictures of their backs but it's like I can see them. Eun-nyeo, we met a real artist. Let's take a picture together. Actresses only get their pictures taken by artists. I'm old. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a present, a gift. Eun-nyeo, go get a facial tonight and... I never said yes. A journey to deliver pictures that haven't been collected... That's romantic. Why do people take pictures? Because pictures last. Once the moment passes... I'm saying... Because time never stays still. That's why I like to take pictures. Real photographers are different. No he isn't! I said the same thing. She's pretty! That's when they're the prettiest. But it doesn't last long. Oh yeah, Mr. Kim. Did you get permission from your wife? What's wrong? You don't have a wife? She passed away. Really? No wonder. I got that vibe from you... I see. I don't want you to be lonely. What does his loneliness have to do with you? And what do I have to do with you? Buddy, take the pictures. Make me look good. Time goes by too fast. It just disappears... Mr. Kim, why do you take pictures of people's backs? I heard they show the truth. Oh my, then I can't have you take a picture of my back. I don't want someone seeing my true side without my knowing. There are people who want to know. It's so weird. Don't people want to hide their true selves? It's easier said than done. You don't have something you want to hide? See? You have one too. But don't you think some people might not like getting the pictures delivered? I don't know... Would people not like getting their memory restored? I bet it depends on what memory that is. That's true. It's from the temple! People look so happy in the pictures. Yes. I'm sure it will remain as a good memory for them. I know it's late, but that's why I wanted to deliver them. The first picture was for this guy. I went there a long time ago, and there was a very old ginkgo. We might've crossed paths! Yeah. Anyway, what are you going to do after you deliver the pictures? I'm going to watch the sunset. You can see the sunrise and sunset at Maryang. There isn't a place like that. It's not possible. Eun-nyeo, there are several more places you can see that at. I've been to one about 10 years ago. Are you going to Jangsu? Welcome Charlie Hwang! Oh yeah, Mr. Kim paid for the medicine, right? No, he hasn't been here recently. Dang it, what if he ran off with my medicine? Please get me my usual, the most expensive one. Whatever, you always have beers. You little! Put it in a pitcher without foam! Got it! Let's leave at 9AM tomorrow, okay? Can't you guys go without me? I would love that. But Ms. Jung is like a little girl. I guess she doesn't like that. Please help me. Here you go. You know it's not cheap, right? Ms. Jung has been through a lot. She received a lot of hate from her mother-in-law because she couldn't have a baby. And her husband cheated on her and got a second wife. She was totally alone after the second wife had a baby. And the two died shortly after in an accident. People were saying that Ms. Jung killed them. So she couldn't live there anymore. Such a rollercoaster of a life... You know a lot. You know everything about the person you like. Charlie, did you borrow money from Mr. Jang and sell fake Viagra? Kang almost died from the pill and ended up at the hospital! Damn it! I told him to go easy on the pills! Why are you taking it out on me? Let's figure out where we're going to go. We'll go to Ohkcheon first and then Daejeon. We'll slip out in Ohkcheon so... Wait. You can slip out for us. I'm sorry! - Did you have to wait long? - No, it's okay my dear Hepburn. My back... No! You have to get in here. Come on Ms. Hepburn. A special seat for you! I'll sit in the back with Mr. Kim. Actresses don't get in the front. Hey, it took me 6 months for her to get comfortable with me. This isn't right. I ended up as a chauffeur at this age. You sure you know where we're going? I've performed 1529 times around the country! I know the roads like the back of my hand! That looks good. We'll have 3 potatoes. A little bit for two of them and a lot for the last one. My nickname in high school was potato. You guys look really alike! I guess couples do end up looking like each other. Really? - Which features? - No they don't. They're not a couple. They just met. Do you not have eyes? Hey, distance yourself from her! People are getting the wrong idea. What are you doing? Don't stand so close to him! You're so immature. I don't want the potatoes! Will we find it today? It changed a lot since 10 years ago. Are we even at the right place? Don't worry. I'll find it soon. Hey, I think we passed it. I know this place better than you! Then why are you struggling? It's changed so much. That's what they all say. Anyone here? Yes, welcome! Excuse me, do you know who this is? He looks familiar... I heard he's been living in this town for a long time. The chef might know. She's been here the longest. Hey, come out here for a second. What is it? Do you know who they are? Oh, it's Mr. Park! That was a good time for them... There's a store down this road. He drives a forklift there. Is that him? Does he drive a forklift all day like a hamster trapped on his wheel? We're doing the same. Not me. I have a free soul. Of course you do. Hey, just give up on it. He got into gambling and beat his wife and got a divorce. He'll flip if you show him the picture. Yeah, let's just go. Let's just go. Do something! He wouldn't have come all the way here if I was able to stop him. But still! Go! Excuse me. What's going on? You're the owner of this picture, right? Who are you? Why do you have this picture? Who are you? Why do you have this? What do you want me to do? Hey, are you okay? So much time has passed. Don't be tortured anymore. It's all in the past. And you're regretting it a lot. I thought I had gotten over it. I thought I'd get over it. Let's go. What a poor guy. Let's hurry up and go. My plate is gone! The plate is gone? Dang it! They took my plate because I didn't pay my taxes! Just my luck. I have to walk at this age? This can't be happening for Charlie Hwang. Why didn't you pay your taxes on time? Let's just walk and enjoy the view. Eun-yeo, come here. Let's take a picture together. You have unpaid rent! I have my limits! I've done all I can, you know that right? Of course. You've been very good to us. But... You have until the end of this week. Someone is moving in so pack your things. Ma'am! You know I work even with this body. How could you... Whatever! You're always making excuses. Pay up! I'm tired of this. Uhmm... is someone named Hwang Young-soo... You're his father? You know who I am? So you are him! Oh my gosh! I guess he still had this picture. I think I'm the one who took it. He showed me it every day since we started dating. He said he'd live with you someday. I can't believe you're really here dad. He said you'd come. "Dad?" Who are these two? Oh right, I'm his friend. He told us he'd introduce us to his son. Oh, you're his friends. It's so nice to meet you guys. I'm sorry that you guys have to see us like this. It's fine. All young people live like this. Of course. My life was like this too. I guess Young-soo has gone somewhere? He's... He's in prison. Prison? He didn't do anything bad. He just got into an accident at work. He couldn't pay the fine... How much was the fine? It was $5,000, but we've almost paid it off now. We made a living because he was a truck driver. But we lost all we had because of the accident. But I'm going to work and make up the remaining balance. Work? In that state? I have to be off to work now. I'll see you guys in the morning. But you're carrying a baby... Look at this. What's up with him? Why couldn't he be doing well? I guess you're worried even though he's not your kid. It doesn't feel good to see this. And? Are you going to go see Young-soo tomorrow? I'm not sure. It's not like he's my son. What's the point of seeing him? But shouldn't you see him since you came all the way here? Yes, you should see him. He believes you're his father. I'm not feeling well. I didn't say anything. Look here buddy. What? Should we just leave? What are you talking about? I don't want to keep pretending to be his father. And you're not feeling well either. You guys can go. - I'll leave you two alone. - Come on. That's not what I mean. Is there a special reason why you're trying so hard to deliver the pictures? What a great view. Would you like to listen to my baby? What's the point of us going in? Yeah, I'm sure Young-soo doesn't want to meet us at a place like this either. I told you it's okay. I'm sure he'll be happier if I said his father's friends were here too. You guys should come. Let's go. Come with us. Dad? Where are you going? What are you talking about? That's just how it went. I thought he'd learn the truth over time. What about my husband? He's lived his whole life believing that you were his father. I didn't know it would end up like this. How could you be so irresponsible? You break it to him nicely. And don't be too upset. You're just going to leave? You should see him before you go. I think we need to cut off our ties here. We didn't meant to come here anyway. But don't you feel bad for Young-soo? He believes you're his father. That's enough guys. I'm going to go. Dad! Please just see him once. You don't have to come here again. You don't ever have to see him again. So please see him just once. Hwang Dal-joo! If he learns that you're not his father after all this time... If you just leave like this... What will my husband do? My husband... My husband... He's been waiting so long for his father. Tell him that you're not his father to his face. So he doesn't wait anymore! Let me ask you for a favor for the first and last time. Dad! Dad! Long time no see. Honey, your father came yesterday out of the blue to see you. Dad. You're healthy and well, right? Yes. What about you? I ended up in here... I'm sorry that you have to see me like this after all this time. It's okay. Life happens. I went to the place you used to live at several times. You did? Yes, but you weren't there. So I thought you might see the letter and come find me. That's why I didn't move and waited for you. Thank you. Thank you for coming to find me. Kiddo, why were you waiting for me? Don't wait for me anymore. To be honest... I'm actually... You're my father. You're my father. That's why I waited for you. Young-soo. And I will continue to do so. Mom passed away too. You're the only one I have. She died? Mi-Jung? Yes. Three years ago to cancer... I see... That must've been hard. I missed you dad. I waited so long for you. I'm sorry. Dad is sorry. No, I just need it for an emergency. $500. It will be hard, huh? No, I'm sorry for asking when we haven't talked in a while. Okay, let's meet up soon. Bye. Over here! Where did you run off to by yourself? We were going to leave without you. I almost died carrying your bags! You must've gone somewhere nice. I just went to go get some fresh air before we leave. Why didn't you take me with you? He can go by himself! Do we have just one more place left now? I thought we'd stay here longer. I'm sad it's ending soon. Wait, where's your camera? You always had it by your side. You can't have lost it. I'm hungry. Isn't the food coming out? It will be out soon. What's this? What is this? Your grandchild will be here soon. You need hospital money. Where did you get this kind of money from? You didn't... I can't take this! Don't go around asking for money from people. Just take this. I left it at a pawn shop so I can go collect it later. How can a soldier go around without his gun? How can I take it when I know you care about it more than your own life? It's fine! Come on. When is the food coming out? Welcome. Three earliest tickets to Jangsu please. Okay. There's one at 12:15. Three tickets, right? Sir? Sir? I should just give up, right? Just two tickets please. - Two. - Okay. I'm going to stay here. You two go. What are you doing? What's going on? Fates are really something. I can't believe I'm doing this when they're not really family. So that's how it's going to be? I don't think it will be bad thinking he's my son and she's my daughter-in-law. There's no one to welcome me home if I go back home. But this is going to be our last time, and this is the goodbye? Why is it going to be our last? I'm going to get the camera back and give it to you. We still have a lot of time. Ms. Hepburn, enjoy your trip. I would love it if you could go to my house and clean the dust off from time to time. Okay. You can't leave just like that. Be careful with that guy. He's naughty. Have a good time with your new family. And don't flirt with all the women. But my feelings for you were genuine! Alright then. Hurry! It was nice meeting you. Take care of yourself. Bye. Bye! Take good care of Eun-nyeo! Are you not feeling well? It's nothing. I'm just a little tired. Just return the picture and rest up today. Why are you asking for a drink in broad daylight? - Let me just drink! - I can't believe you! You're killing me! Then just leave! - My back! - Always getting on me about drinking. They're fighting. Who are you guys? Is it your first time seeing a couple fight? Stop yelling at strangers. You look familiar. Are you stupid? He's a photographer. He took a picture of us at the temple. The temple! What are you doing here? You look pretty. You looked pretty back then. How long ago was this? You look handsome too. I was always handsome. Isn't that a Polaroid camera you have there? Shall we take a picture? Could you do one for us? One, two... I told you so many times to stand more forward! My face looks bigger! - Your face is just bigger. - No it isn't! What about your face? The blue sky looks so pretty. It's because it's a blue sunset. A blue sunset? They call it the magic hour because it's when you see the most beautiful view after the sun has gone down. It's photographers' favorite sky. That's cool. A beautiful view after the sun sets... Let's go take a picture of that magic hour. Welcome. What would you like? I think you're famous for soondae soup. Two soondae soups please. Soondae soup? Okay, coming right up. This is good. How did you learn about this restaurant? Oh, just... It seems like you know Jangsu well. Hey Da-won! It's cold right? Let's go inside! - Excuse me. - Yes? Your baby is cute. How old is she? Da-won, how old are you? Three? Could I hug her? Sure. What's your name? Da-won, let's not bother the customers. Hey, you took a picture of my back too, huh? A picture of my true self that I can't hide... You're bright and pretty. Like a little girl. You're so bad at lying. You looked sad. And angry too. But you look pretty at peace now. The story Dal-joo told you about me is a story from a movie I was in. No wonder the movie failed, right? Those things happened back in the day. And I lied about my role in the movie, too. I just had a role of a passerby. But I somehow ended up falling in love with the director of the movie. No, I just admired him. I knew he had a wife. But I didn't care back then. We lived like that for a few years. One day, his wife came to me. She asked me to break up with him. I was ashamed of our love too anyway. And I didn't want to break up a family. So I just let him go quietly. I was pregnant at the time. But I couldn't tell him. Being a single mom was so hard. After thinking about it for a long time, I sent her off to an orphanage. I came here to see my daughter. I can see my daughter from afar if I come to Jangsu. So you mustered up the courage to go inside earlier? Yes. I went inside today because I got the courage since you were here. I was scared that she'd recognize me. What would I do if she recognized me? I was scared. So Da-won is your granddaughter then. When I saw Da-won earlier, I was about to lose it. Why didn't I come earlier? Nam-woo. I think I'll be able to come here by myself from now on. You helped me. Thank you Nam-woo. I take pictures of people's backs because I lack the courage. The courage to face the truth. I'm going to lay it all down now. This is my last trip to go ask for forgiveness from my wife. Hey, what are you going to do after you deliver the pictures? I'm going to go watch the sunset. You can see the sunset and sunrise at Maryang. Sir, could you go faster? I'm sorry. You've changed a lot. I only had eyes for you my whole life. But you kept being suspicious of me. To be honest, I was scared and anxious. I'm anxious even in this moment too. I don't know when you'll get suspicious of me again. I wonder how you feel reading this letter. I'm really sorry. I'm going to leave this world now. But I'm not going to blame you. Honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry honey... It's all my fault. I foolishly doubted you. Honey... I'm sorry! And your son... Our one and only son Jong-ha. Please take good care of him. It's a wish from his horrible mother. Nam-woo? Nam-woo! Nam-woo! Nam-woo! Nam-woo! Nam-woo! What are you doing? No! Nam-woo, stop it! This won't change anything! No Nam-woo! Stop it! No! No Nam-woo! Drink the water frequently. Let's go. Dang it, my short legs. Bro! Long time no see Dal-joo. Long time no see Ms. Hepburn. Bro, how have you been? Long time no see. So you really are in a wheelchair. Are you used to it now? I like it that I don't have to walk. It just sucks for her. When have you started calling him bro? It just happened. I'm glad you're doing well. Bro, guess what this is. I got your camera back. How did you... I went and got it from the pawn shop. I saw your ID then too. My gosh, you were 12 years older than me. Anyway, it's nice to see it again. Thanks. Charlie Hwang is retired from the celebrity life. I cleaned up my act thanks to Young-soo and his wife. I run a vegetable shop now. Good. What about your grandchild? She's here. She's amazing. I brought a picture. Ta-da. She's so pretty! She's cute. Come on bro. Let's go! You're not going to go inside? I'm good now that I've seen them doing well. Let's go. This is fresh out of the oven. It's good. This is $2.50. And this one is on us. - I'll take that one too. - This one? You're getting a lot. I hope you come back. Hey Jo Hang-man! I'm here. Let me see your face! Jo Hang-man! Who are you looking for? My friend Jo Hang-man used to work here. Jo Hang... Oh, right! Him! I heard that he passed away 2 months ago. Hold on, I think there's something of his here. Please wait here. This was in his drawer. It's his, right? I wonder if they're all doing well. I'm talking about the people we delivered the pictures to. I don't know. They could be having a difficult time. Or they could be doing well. I'm sure they're doing well. Like how I'm alive right now, they'll continue to push through somehow. Laying down what's in the past. Like how I'm doing right now. Can you stand over there? Why? Just stand there. Here? You look pretty. I'm scared. My illness will get worse so I won't be able to remember the times we've had together. I'm sorry for not telling you this truth. But I'm really happy right now because I get to be with you. Eun-nyeo. Thank you so much. Don't worry. I'll remember you forever. Subtitles by OnDemandKorea
