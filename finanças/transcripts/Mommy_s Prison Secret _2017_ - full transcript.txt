- My God! I've got crow's feet. - I think you look beautiful. Breakfast? - I'm too nervous to eat. - Look, don't sweat this. You've got it! - What do you think of this one? I liked the one before better. - No time for that. It's a big day for me. - For all of us. - Where is she? Bianca? Bianca? - Not fair! I wanted to see your bra again! - Who you talking to? - Maya. Um, that shirt's not, too revealing? - Mom! What do you want? - Be ready in 10 minutes, or you're taking the bus! - You know what? When you were away, Dad always used to drive me. - Your point being? - No threats. He'd just drive me. - Ten minutes! ...on Cross Chat later, we'll have the deputy of Trust General to discuss... - She's still treating me like I just got back yesterday. Give her time. - It's been 6 months! How much time does she need? - What is it? - He's dead! - Who? - Warden Lester Feldman. Two days ago. - What? How? - To be determined, following an autopsy. - "At work, slumped over his desk." Jesus! That's crazy! - What's crazy? Nothing, honey. What? You getting dressed up for, Blake? What? - You're like an emotional sniper. I could so take you. - Come on. We're gonna be late. - Understand? Let's go, then! - All right! - So, are you going to invite him over so we can meet him? - What? Who? - I know you weren't video-chatting with Maya. - Video-chatting? Yeah, video-chatting... - Come on! You know what I mean! - ...on the interwebs? His name's Neil. And he's really nice! And I like him a lot, so please don't ruin this for me. - How am I gonna ruin it for you? - I already get enough grief from the kids at school! - Grief over what? - You! Should I--should I park and say hello? - No. I'm already late, and you'd have to park, so just don't. - OK, um, have a good day. - Yeah. Thanks, Mom. - OK. - Bye! - Bye! Vice Principal Gillespie? Vice Principal? Hi! - Mrs. Reynolds, you're going to have to move along. - You--you got my call about the trip? - Yes, 6 times! - And--and Lenni Page and Blake Peterson also called on my behalf? - Yes, and they both sang your praises. Have a nice day. - No, but, please, please, it's really important. - I'll see you for the trip on Monday. - Great! OK, I'm going! Black, 2 sugars! - Mario's? - Yep! - Don't think you can bribe me with coffee! - I'm so sorry about Warden Feldman. I just read about it this morning. - Yeah, it came as quite a shock. He was always in such great shape. - So, what happened? - Natural causes? They don't know yet. Anyways, let's get this done. Is there anything you'd like to say before being officially liberated? - Well, I just have one comment. - Go ahead. - I think our tax dollars could've been better spent. - Ya think? - Three years was a pretty severe sentence. 2nd DUI. Blew 1.2. That's way over. Found a quarter ounce of marijuana in the glove compartment. Served a year and a half. Got an early release due to extenuating circumstances. - Thanks to Warden Feldman. - And 6 months supervised probation. That brings us to today. - So, you're saying it should've been worse? - I'm saying, under the circumstances, it could've been worse. - OK. I see your point. - I'm very happy for you, Taylor, but don't paint yourself as a victim. - No, you're right. - Good. Let's get this done. Give me your Jane Hancock right here. Congratulations! You are now officially liberated. Has, Lenni given you any more shifts at the shelter? - No, but I've got my fingers crossed. - If she suggests, are you gonna help run the, group at the jail? - I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back in there just yet. - I think it'd be a good idea. But you two work it out. I'm gonna miss our coffees together. - Well, I could always come by and say hello. - Well, not till next week. I'm going fishing this weekend. Much needed R & R. Come, let me walk you out. So, how you gonna celebrate your newfound freedom? - I'm gonna do something I haven't been legally allowed to do for 2 years. Hey! I'm a free woman! - Congrats, honey! Nice-going! Where are you? I'm at, I'm at Crisp Market, getting some groceries for tonight. Really? You like to reload your gun while you shop? How do you feel? - I feel great. I'll see you later, OK? See you at home. - Love you! - Love you! - Hi, Geraldine. You know, the, baby barbecue potatoes are on special today. - No, that's fine. I'm actually in a little bit of a rush. Come on! I--I must've left my wallet somewhere between here and... You left your wallet where? - I--I misplaced it. Geraldine, could you just put these on account for me? And then I'll just go find my wallet, and I'll come right back. - I would, Ms. Reynolds. You know I would. I really would. - Please? - It's Brian, the day manager. - OK, then. - So, what's Brian the day manager's problem? - Meghan! - Hey! - What--what are you doing in Springfield? - I had to get out of Boston for a while. I remember you always going on about the wonders of Springfield like it was some kind of utopia. Don't know if I see it so much, utopia-wise. What's the problem here? - Lost her wallet, allegedly. - It's stupid, really. I'm sure-- - Do you shop here, regularly? - Um, yeah. It's fine. I'll just come back. - No. That's ridiculous. What do you say, Geraldine? - Out of my hands! Brian knows she has a record. He's not gonna go for it. - So, it's Brian who's being a bitch. How much? - $58.00. - Let's just go. - You know, I could report you. This... This is called discrimination. - OK, that's enough, Meghan, OK? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Don't apologize to her! - Come on. Meghan, just calm down, all right? It's no big deal. - It is a big deal! Screw that cow! People like that, they need to be shut down, you know? - They just don't understand. - No, goddamn right they don't! - I'm late. I gotta run. - Run? Is that any way to treat an old friend? Smoke? What, you quit? - A while ago. - Yeah, sure you did. - Look, I better get going. Thanks, you know, for covering for me. - Sure! - Where should I send the money? - What do you mean, send it? Come on! We'll catch up! I'll drop by! Screw you both! What? You were always too nice... to strangers. Leave a message for Blake Peterson, Springfield Probation Office. - Hey, Blake, it's Taylor. Um, I'm sorry to bother you, but, um, I saw Meghan Flanagan today. I mean, she just showed up. It was kind of weird. Um, anyway, if you get this, will you just give me a call? All right. I hope the fish are biting. Bye! We're home! - Hey! I'm out here! - What's all this? - A little celebration. - What for? They're beautiful! - Can I go upstairs now? - Can you put these in water? - Well, it's finally over. - Seems so. - Seems so? What, did something happen with Blake? - No, no, no. Everything's fine. Bianca! - Yep? - Thank you. I just wanna say... - Wow! I didn't know we were doing speeches! - You shush! - I just wanna say thank you for being so understanding, and, um, you know, you both have stood by me and... - Yeah, we've stood by each other. - So, can I have some wine? - No. Right. We've stood by each other. And I really, really appreciate it. So, now, here's to getting back to normal! - Back to normal. Man! OK. I got this. - Get the wine, your phone. - All right. Yes, get the wine. - Condiments can wait. - Go, go, go! - All right! Ha ha! Burgers are done! You know, I forgot to tell you that I bumped into that witch, Gillespie, at school today. - That's kind of harsh! - Well, she hates me! And she spoke to Lenni and Blake, and I get to be a chaperone for the trip to Boston! - That's great! - Yeah. That's great. - Hey, come on! I've missed out on so much, OK? I wanna participate in your life. Wait! Yeah, here. - Thank you! - Yeah, I know. - OK, so, do you want well-done or more rare-ish? - We were learning about mad-cow disease in science today. Actually eats away at your brain until it's like a sponge. - That's delightful. - Well-done for you, then! - Heck yes! Thank you! - We're about to eat. Let's just leave it. - What? What if it's for me? - I'll get it. - No! No, no! I'll get it. - What a night! - Meghan! What are you doing here? - I was in the neighbourhood. I thought I'd come by and finally meet your family! - How did you find me? - Well, we lived in a room together for a year and a half. You know, I listened. - You listened. - Yeah, that and I snuck a peek at your mail every once in a while. - Hey! Your mad-cow burger's getting cold. Hi! - Hi. - Um, do you have any cash? Sure. I need, 60 bucks. - OK. - We had a thing at the market. - What thing? - Um, well, I lost my wallet, and Meghan... This is Meghan. - Hi. She bailed me out. - Thanks. - You're soaked! - Got caught in the storm. - Please, come on in. Thank you. - So, this is our daughter... - Bianca! I've heard so much about you. I'm Meghan, an old friend of your mom's. - Here you go. Thanks! You guys are right in the middle of dinner. Yeah, well, we can't kick you out in this weather, so... - Yeah, I mean, you're here now, so... - Have a glass of wine? - That'd be great. Thanks. - So, that's Meghan? - Yeah, my old cellmate. Not a word about this to Bianca. How's the burger? - What is she doing in Springfield? - I don't know. She just showed up. - What do you wanna do? - Not much we can do now! Salad looks good too. You're not drinking? No. No. Thanks! - Welcome. - Cheers! Well, I've been a mechanic at the Porsche dealership for, what... - Well, about 12 years now. - I didn't see a Porsche out front. - I'll own one eventually, when we get back on our feet. - Yeah, and I get my licence this year, so fingers crossed. - And you like the job? - For me, it's a dream job. - Dream cars! - No doubt! You like going fast, Bianca? - Don't encourage her. - So, what brings you to Springfield? - She just needed to get out of Boston, right? - I sure did. - My class is going this week, overnight! - Fun! - Hey! I'm not done yet. - Should we open another? - Sure! Yeah. Why not? - So, how do you two know each other? - Well, um... - It's no secret. We were cellmates in jail. Really? - Well, what--what was that like? I mean, my mom never lets us talk about that. - Um, maybe that's a conversation for another time? - When you're incarcerated, there is almost an instant transformation. - From what to what? - It kind of sounds simplistic, but, suddenly, you're locked up, and everybody on the outside isn't. - So, what's the transition? - Us versus them. You realize they don't want you. And those prisoners, they're your new family. - What about your real family? - Some people still have them, of course, but... there's a bond that's created with people you do time with. It's undeniable. Wouldn't you agree? - I guess so. - Well, I'd be scared. I've made friends inside that would do anything for me, that would never betray me. Friends closer than family. - But Taylor had us, out here. She did have you, out there. - You know, but it's prison, and it is not a place you ever wanna be. - I know that. I'm not gonna break the law. - You know what? You make it sound almost good. - No, I don't mean to. It's... It's rough. And you do see the worst in people. - Well, what about my mom? What was she like? - Your mom? She was strong. She was smart, compassionate. She inspired us. I don't know what I would've done without her. - You never told us any of this. - It's hard. - It's--it's hard for people to understand who haven't been through it. - What were you in for? Well, that's a question you never ask and, in prison, is never answered, so... Hey, babe! What do you mean, I can't stay over tonight? Could I spend the night? - Um, I really don't think it's a good idea. - Please! - No, I really-- I'm-- This is kind of last-minute of you. Seriously? - It's time for bed. - Are you gonna let her stay? It'll be fun! - Time for bed! What do you want me to do? - OK. I'll take your plate. - Good night, honey. That was informative. Hey, you OK? - Sure! - Don't give me that "I gotta work." I know your schedule. - I finally get to hear what you were like in jail. Yeah, well, screw you! Really? I come here to see you, and this is the welcome I get? - Listen, Jeff. I don't want her to stay. - Why not? - It's too much. - Well, just tell her no, then. - I don't think I can. - Why? - It's complicated. - What, complicated like a relationship status on Facebook? - Jeff, this is serious, OK? I don't want her here. - All right! ...tomorrow or the next day... - Leave it to me. I know how to talk to people. Hey. - Hey. Sorry about that. Problems? - It's just I thought I had a place to stay tonight, and then at the last minute, he's being a jerk! Right. About that, I'm not sure that staying here tonight is... What? - Can I ask you something? You ever been in an impossible situation, and... ...you know, you use all your strength to overcome it, and you succeed at doing that, just to find out there's gonna be another hundred obstacles thrown at you? - No, I'm not exactly sure I understand what you mean. - That's what me and Taylor have been through. Right. Listen, about tonight... - Yeah, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. I don't really have cash for a motel, so... - Yeah, um... - You are saving my life. - We'll set up a room for you. - OK! - Pretty sweet setup you got here. Nice house, great kid, hot husband. He did his best to kick me out. - Like leading a lamb to slaughter. - Well, don't be mad at him. You should've done it yourself. - Why'd you say all those things about me? - Well, why not? You should be a hero to your family. - None of it was true. - So, what's the harm if I tell a few white lies? - What do you want from me? - It's just that... I'll never understand why you turned on me. - I didn't... - You didn't what? You didn't betray me? We both know that you did. - Maybe you should just go. - No. - What do you mean, "no"? - Well, do you want me to go tell Jeff and your beautiful daughter who you really are? That you accepted my friendship and my protection, and then you turned on me in the worst possible way? You owe me, so I'm gonna stay here for now. - For now? - Yeah, that's right. You coming to bed? - Yeah. I'll be right there. - I think I'm a little drunk. You get her settled in? - Yeah. - Sorry I didn't... I went out there thinking: "She can't stay." And within 2 minutes, I was all like: "How long do you wanna stay?" - She's very persuasive. - What was it like, you know, living with her for a year and a half in a cell? - It was, um... You know, I mean, just... - Why can't you talk to me about any of this stuff? - It's just-- It's just hard to explain if you haven't been... - Been inside? Look, come on, honey! You're not exactly Henry Hill from Goodfellas. - Why do you have to do that? - Do what? - Minimize my experience. You don't know anything about it. - 'Cause you won't tell me anything about it. You act like it's a goddamn cherished secret or something! - Can we just drop it? - Fine, but I wasn't the one who got behind the wheel after drinking and then mouthed off to the cops. - And I wasn't the one that left a quarter ounce of pot in the glove compartment. - Are you ever gonna forgive me? You found our stash. - Your stash? Right. Your stash. You can't sleep? We had an argument. - Not about me, I hope. - No. - Not yet, at least. You want a bite? - Hey, could I ask you something? - Shoot. - How long were you in jail? - This time or total? - Total, I guess. - Well... I'm 38. Including juvie... 12 years, on and off. - Wow! - Is that a lot? - It sure seems like it. - Yeah, well, it's long enough that I know what's on the menu every day and night at the Chicopee and Framingham jail, and it ain't this! Let me ask you something. Taylor ever tell you how she got released early? - No. - I didn't think so. Good night, Jeff. Jesus! - What? - You are gorgeous. - Thanks! - You know what the worst part about being in jail is? - Living in a cell with my mom for a year and a half? - That's funny. Not being able to do this. Breakfast of champions! - Aren't you still on probation? - Really? You one of us or one of them? - Um, my mom, she would kill me if she found out. - How about I handle your mom? OK. I like school! - Yeah? All of it? ...the social part of it! Man, I was the worst student! Why are you laughing? I was! Well, I'm sure you weren't so bad. - I was! No, you've got no idea. It's good to just, you know, relax outside. - Yeah! - You got any big plans for tonight? - Not really. I'm just supposed to meet a friend. We're just hanging out. - Friend? Yeah. Y'all have fun with that. I don't know if that's the neighbourhood peeping Tom, or if he's here to see you. - That's Neil. Hey! It's another beautiful Saturday in Springfield. For those looking for a bargain, we've got the big, annual flea market down at First Presbyterian. And maybe for those not looking for a deal, we've got the Classic Car Roundup down by the convention centre, which is happening today... - Your assistant's not working with you today? - She's hanging out with her new best friend. - You know, it's late. Why didn't you wake me? - It's Saturday. I thought maybe you needed the sleep. What are you looking for? - Do we have any more bullets? - What for? - I just wanna know. - Yeah. Top drawer on the left. Like you insisted, guns and bullets always separate. You know we have, dinner with Lenni tonight. - Right. Hey... Sorry about last night. - It's just hard for me sometimes. We're gonna get through this. - I know. Um, so... - It's your future son-in-law. Not funny. He looks like a man. - Handsome little man! - Mom, this is Neil. - Hello, ma'am. - Very polite! Nice to meet you, Neil. - I'm Meghan, Taylor's younger sister from Miami. - We're gonna go meet some friends. Can I talk to you inside for just a sec? - Yes. I'll be right back. So, Heh! Miami. - Yeah, sure. Why not? You play football, Neil? - Varsity wrestling. I bet you like a good tussle every now and then. But it's one thing when you embarrass me in front of my friends... My God! You've got a really good body, Neil. - Um... Thanks. I mean, you know, so do you. - OK! Remember to meet us at the restaurant at 8:00. - Yes. Bye, Auntie Meghan. - See you around, stud! Well, he looks dumb. - He does look kind of dumb. - We're going out for dinner? No. It's a-- It's a family thing with my boss. - It's interesting. - What? - I'm getting the feeling what it must be like to be a parent, you know, more concerned for your child's safety than your own. - Should I be concerned for my safety? - Always! You know that! - Did you give Bianca booze? - I would never. Maybe you don't know your kid as well as you think you do. - Give me your glass. - So sorry. - Here's to the end of your ordeal. - Yeah. To freedom! - I'm sorry about Bianca. I mean, we told her 8:00. - She's a teenager. She'd rather be with her friends. - Yeah, but she's not texting me back. - She's probably just with Maya. - Maybe this will cheer you up. I got you 2 extra shifts at the shelter. - That's great. - Congratulations, honey. - To the Liberty Women's Shelter. - To the Liberty. - Maybe you should give Maya another call. Yeah, that's a good idea. Excuse me. - Is she OK? I mean, apart from Bianca, she seems kind of tense. - Yeah, she's wound up. We have this person staying with us. - What person? - Her old cellmate, Meghan something or other. - Meghan Flanagan? - You know her? - From one of my groups at the jail. Why is she staying with you? - I don't know. She just showed up. - She's a real operator. - Hey, do you know how Taylor got an early release? - I thought it was for good behaviour. - A year and a half less for good behaviour? - Did you ask Taylor? - Not yet. Jail's been kind of a touchy subject between us. - Meghan put this in your head? She's been in and out of the system most of her life. - Well, maybe she just needs someone to cut her some slack, give her a chance. - Yeah, maybe. Or maybe not. - We're gonna have to go. I just got ahold of Maya. She hasn't heard from Bianca for hours. - OK. - Would you like me to help you look? No, you've done so much already. Thank you. - No, no. Go, go. I've got this. Thank you. - Thanks for dinner. - Bianca? What the hell happened here? - I cooked! - Where'd all this grease come from? - I tried to make fried chicken. Not as easy as it looks. - We're really mad at you, OK? I'm leaving you another message. It's 10:30. Call me back. - Have you seen Bianca? - I thought she was at the restaurant. - Maybe we should call the police. - Hasn't been long enough. Gotta be 24 hours. I used to run away a lot. - I'm gonna drive around to some of her usual spots. - Let me do it. - Why not me? - I know where her usual spots are. - I should never have let her go out with that kid, Neil. I don't know a thing about him. - Come on. - What? Where are we going? You stole his wallet? - Yeah. You know I'm a criminal, right? - Come on! Everyone at school knows your mom's a felon. - What does that have to do with me? - So, you must have a wild side. - Neil, just give me back my phone. - What's your rush? - My parents are gonna kill me! I'm so late! Don't touch me! - There! Is that them? - Want me to tell everybody at school that you're a frigid, little tease? - Screw you! - Don't be such a-- - It's locked! - Open the door! - Open the door! - Open it right now! - Aaah! - What the hell? You're paying for this! I doubt that. - It's my dad's car! - What were you planning on doing? Kidnapping her? What do you want broken, Neil? - What? - Left or right elbow? Maybe one of your wrists? Your knee or the ball of your ankle? - What the-- Are-- - So, just so you know, man, that ankle ball, it takes the longest to heal. It's the most painful. - Mom? - OK, Meghan, that's enough. - So, what's it gonna be? One of your elbows, a wrist, one of your knees or the ankle? OK, that is enough, Meghan! No! You're not crying, are ya? Are you crying? Come on! Be a man! - I said that's enough! - Hey! You're all crazy! - Come on, let's just-- let's just get out of here. - OK, then! Let's get you home! - Listen, I was thinking, maybe we don't tell Jeff what happened. - Lie to him? - Yeah, that would be great. - Lying's not great. - It's just that if we tell him the truth, he's gonna wanna go over there and confront Neil. Well, you know how guys get. - He is gonna wanna go over there, Mom. - OK, just this once. - You ever grab me like that again, I will end you. You understand? Wait up, B! ...one of the suspects was later identified to be... - Where the hell have you been? - She's fine. - We went looking. What do you know? - We called you a hundred times! - Yeah, I'm sorry. My phone died, and I lost track of time. - Yeah, we just saw her hanging out with a bunch of friends in the mall parking lot. - You said Maya hadn't heard from her in hours. - Other friends. - Yeah. Everything's cool. - No, everything is not cool! And tomorrow, you're gonna call and apologize to Lenni for not showing up. - Let's get you to bed. - Such a bad girl! ...investigators are on the scene. - Thanks for... - You know. Give me a hand? So... She was just hanging out with her friends in a parking lot? - That's a lie? - She was with Neil in his car. You know what that means. So, what? You're just gonna let it go? You don't care your family's lying to you? We've been married 16 years, and we've been through a really rough time. So, if not telling me is gonna bring Bianca and Taylor closer together, fine. I'll get over it. By the way, clean your own mess! Are you mad at me? - Why were you in the car alone with him? - He was gonna drive me home. - Yeah, but what about Maya? I mean, you said you were going with a group of friends. - Yeah, well, she had to leave early. - So did you! It was not cool of you to stand us up like that. - It's not my fault! - Well, whose fault is it? - It's yours! - Mine? How do you figure that? - All they do at school is throw it in my face that you're a felon. - No! You cannot blame me for your irresponsible behaviour. - Do you know what he said to me? He said that I must have a wild side because of you. Mom, it's humiliating! - I'm sorry for having to go away. I've said it over and over again. - Go away? Mom, you went to prison! And you left me and Dad here. And now I have to pay for your mistakes? - It's not fair, but what else can I do to fix it? - I don't know. Probably nothing, really. We're just gonna have to get past this. OK? Now get some sleep. - Mom? What would you have done if Meghan hadn't been there? - I would've handled it. Sorry. - Yeah, I knew she would call. Once a rat, always a rat. Where's your guy? Jeff and Bianca are gonna be home soon. Never mind. There he is. He knows what to do? OK. As long as he does his thing, I'll do mine. - Yeah, I got a call about... Actually, dispatch wasn't too clear on what the problem is. - Um, yes. Thank you for coming. It's a little hard to explain. - Well, do your best, honey. - Well, there's this woman staying here, Meghan Flanagan. I want her to leave. - Why'd you call us? Just ask her to leave. - Well, it's more complicated than that. She's a felon. - An escaped felon? - No, but I think she's violating her parole. - Did you invite this Meghan into your home? - Um, well, technically, yes. - Sit in the back of the car while I check something out on the computer? - No, I'm fine. I'll wait right here. - What's your name? - Um, you know what? Forget it. I think this was a mistake. - Tell me your name. - Taylor Reynolds. - And do you have a criminal record, Taylor? - Yes, but... - Sit in the back of the car while I check out your information. - No, I--I don't want to. No! Officer, is that necessary? I didn't do anything! Officer, please! What--what is your name, Officer? Officer, please! Will you just listen to me? Listen! Officer, please! Officer, come on! Please, will you talk to me? - Just keep quiet back there. Let's go! In the future, don't waste the police department's time. If it wasn't for your friend there... - What did you tell him? - I told him you were off your meds. How about we get you inside, away from these nosy neighbours. OK! That was a dumb move. - Well, I--I called them because-- - I know why you called them. - I can't have you here anymore. Bianca is too impressionable. - Of course she's impressionable! She's 16! - Please, just go! - Can't do that, 'cause, when you stabbed me in the back, you also pissed off some pretty nasty people. - Who? - Well, look at what happened to the Warden Feldman. That doesn't worry you? 'Cause of what you did, I got an extra 6 months in solitary. And you just walk out, a year and a half early? No. That's not fair. - What could I do? - Simple. Make amends! - Amends. - Yeah, you're gonna take a package into the jail for us. - That's impossible. - Nothing's impossible. You'll go in through Lenni Page's prison group on Monday. - No, I can't-- I can't do that. It's Bianca's overnight to Boston. No! - Yeah, so you're gonna cancel that trip. Do you understand what you need to do here, Taylor? - And if I refuse? - Pfft! I don't know. I guess you lose all this fresh air... along with your beautiful family. - Are you threatening my family? - What do you think? Don't let me down. If you'll excuse me, I've got a date! And you've got phone calls to make! There's a general feeling that although, nationally, crime rates are down, we're constantly being fed news of doom. And I wonder if the media is to blame for not painting an accurate picture of not only Springfield, but the country at large. I wasn't sure at first, but, I've been thinking about it. - You seemed pretty sure that you didn't wanna do it. What's changed? - You know, I realized that working the group might be a way for me to make amends. - What's going on? I don't know. Can we talk about something? Just you and me, though. - Of course. - I feel guilty. - For what? - 'Cause I miss the days when it was just you and me here. - I know, honey. But your mom's really trying. - What if we never get back to the place we were before? - Maybe the goal is to get to some place better. You wanna help me fix this car? - Nah, I kind of got some homework to do. - OK. - Well, how about I come in tomorrow? We'll see how it goes. If I don't nail it, then we can reassess. -I don't know. This sudden change of heart doesn't have anything to do with Meghan Flanagan, does it? - How do you know about Meghan? Jeff told me at dinner. - You've always seen right through me. Yes, it does. I mean, ever since Meghan came back into my life, I realized that I abandoned all the women that I did time with, and I need to fix that. OK, then. Let's give it a shot. - Great! OK. I'll see you tomorrow! Bye! - Hey! - Hey! Going on a calendar shoot? - Nah, going on a date. But kind of wanted your help, you know, just to complete my outfit. Should I go bra... or, um... ...no bra, you know? What works best? - This kind of thing generally work on men you know? - Yeah, no bra generally works best. - I hate to break it to you, Meghan, but you're not 20 anymore. - So? You're the one holding my bra. Why don't you try to act your age? See you later, Taylor! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What's going on? - Nothing, honey. It's just Meghan and her date, OK? Just go back to sleep. - Who does she think she is? This is ridiculous. This is too much. - Honey, don't. - Stay here. - What's going on down here? - What the-- - What the hell are you doing? Who the hell are you? - This is my house! - Hey, hey! OK, OK! - Have some respect! - That's enough, boys. - There's a kid in this house! - You're gonna need to get the hell out of here. I'm sorry. We were just trying to have a little fun. You should try it some time. What a piece of work! - So, what happened last night? Nothing, honey. - I'm not stupid. Was Meghan doin' it with some guy in our living room? - Yeah, she tried to but-- - Yeah, but then your father put his foot down. Are you sure you can drive her? - Yeah. It's no problem. - OK. - See you later. - OK. So, do you have everything you need? - Yeah. What's up with you? - Nothing. - You were so excited for this trip, and then, what, you just can't go all of a sudden? - Well, no, no. I mean, I just couldn't get out of this thing with Lenni. But I--I'm gonna make it up to you. Yeah, if you say so. - OK. Have a great time. OK? Be careful. Boston isn't Springfield! - Yeah. - Bye. - I'm getting the feeling that Jeff doesn't like me. - Can you blame him after last night? - The package is hidden in the inside pocket. Our old friend, Donny, will be the guard on duty. Don't open it for anybody else. - This is a one-time thing. - Hey, Taylor? You just do this. OK? You owe me. - Can I go? - Good luck. - I was beginning to think you weren't gonna show! - I got caught in a little traffic. - You sure you're ready for this? - Let's do it! - OK. - Well! Welcome back, Mrs. Reynolds! - Hey, Donny. New warden wants to see you. - Yeah, I'll be there when I'm finished here. - No, he said now. I'll handle this. Miss? I need to look in your bag. What's this? - I was just... - Smart woman. The food in here will kill ya! Have a nice day. - You know what? You did great. See you next week? - OK. Yeah. - Bye, hon. - Bye. OK. - Hi, Mom! - How's it going? It's good! We're just taking a break from the museum, and we're gonna go to Boston Common. It's great. I'm having a great time. - That's great. Um, I'm so sorry I'm not there with you right now. - Yeah, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it. - I'll see you tomorrow. OK, honey? - Yeah. Bye, Mom. - Love you! - Bye! Leave a message for Blake Peterson, Springfield Probation Office. - Blake, Blake! Um, I was hoping that you'd be back by now. Um... I really need to see you. OK? So, um... I just cannot let her screw up my life. OK, please, just call me. OK? All right, bye. OK! - Hey! You know, I was thinking that when Bianca gets back from Boston, that we cou-- What the-- - You want me to stop? - No, no. - OK. - I don't know what you've been up to, but please keep it up! - You did a pretty good job of that yourself. I'd murder somebody for a smoke right now. Why did we ever quit smoking? - Because we wanted to be better, healthier people. This is nice. - So... how did you get an early release? - Did Meghan tell you about it? - She said I should ask. - Everything she told you and Bianca about me... was a lie. I mean, she controlled everything in there. And, eventually, she controlled me as well. - Why didn't you tell me about any of this? - I'm just ashamed of the person I became in there. And I just-- I didn't-- I didn't want to involve you, and I... I felt like you'd judge me. - We're married. I'd never judge you. - There's more. So, Warden Feldman came to me and asked if I would help him out. - How? - Meghan was bringing drugs in with that corrupt guard. - That guy, Donny. - Yeah. And so I found out where they were hiding it. I mean, it didn't take a genius. I was with her all the time. I was such a liar. But it was my opportunity. - You weren't afraid of what they'd do to you? - It was a risk I was willing to take. I mean, I just-- I had to get back to you guys. - So, what's she doing here? Why--why isn't she locked up? - I mean, I thought they would give her so much more time, but they ended up just giving her 6 months in solitary. - Well, we have to call the cops! - I'm gonna talk to Blake about it. He'll know what to do. - What does she want from you? - Let me just-- Let me talk to Blake. - He's not even a cop. - Well, I didn't--I didn't tell you before, but I called the cops, and--and it didn't go so well. Do you trust me? - Yeah, of course I do. - So let me just do this my way, OK? I promise nothing will go wrong. What is it? You called? - What the hell happened? - How'd it go? -They changed guards. I almost got arrested. I heard. - Then the package wasn't there. -It was a test run. Just wanna make sure I can trust you. - A test run? That wasn't part of the deal! All right? Game over! What? What are you doing? Get away from her! What is wrong with you? Relax! I just wanted to make sure that you wouldn't betray me! We'll do it again another day. - No! No, that wasn't part of the deal! The deal changed! - I was just gonna call you. - I need your help. - I heard your messages. Tell me what happened. - Meghan Flanagan showed up, the one that I set up with Warden Feldman. - What does she want? - She's forcing me to take drugs into jail. I can't do it. I cannot risk losing my freedom again, my family. I just... I can't do it. - Who else is involved? - It's Meghan and that-- and that guard, Donny. They're making me go back in again. - Back in? - The first time was a test run. - Yeah? OK. I understand. Can I see the contents of your purse? - What? - The purse. - Why? OK, but-- OK, sure. - What's this? - It must've been Meghan. - Step away from the desk, please. - Blake! No. Please. What's going on, Blake? Blake, you-- - The weight of the drugs, possession with intent to sell... 2 prior convictions... You're looking at 25 to life. - Who was that on the phone, Blake? Blake! - You got a choice to make. - Who called you? What do you have to do with this? - 25 to life. Or you do what Meghan has asked. Choose. Now. - Lenni, I need to see you, OK? OK, bye. So, what do you think? - It could work. I still think we should get the police involved. - I just don't feel like I can trust them. - I've known the new warden for years. I know I can trust him. Let me talk to him. - OK. Thanks. - Hey! - Hi! - Hey! - So, Lenni, will you excuse us? - We'll meet at my office tomorrow morning? - OK. - What's going on? - I need to talk to you about something. - I know we talked about this last night, but why aren't we going to the cops? - Well, Mom and Lenni say they're working it out. - Aren't you worried? - Yeah. I am worried. But we have to trust her. She's doing it for us. - So, I'm gonna have to go in a minute. - Should we be here? Maybe I should take Bianca home. - Well, Lenni thinks that the safest place for you is in her office, and she's fine with that. So just wait for my call. - What if something goes wrong? - Nothing's gonna go wrong. - I promise. - I love you, Mom. - I love you too. Hey. Yeah, I know where that is. - That was really stupid, going to Blake. - No, letting you into my house was stupid. - Don't do anything like that again. - Just leave my family out of this. - We don't even need them. Evidence that Blake has on you, the weight of the drugs in the bag... What? - I was trying to figure out what was in this for you. - Yeah? What did you come up with? - Well, first I thought it was just revenge against me, and then I remembered paradise. All those nights you talked to me about escaping to paradise. That's what it was, right? Right, looking at that postcard every morning when you woke up. - You took my postcard. - So, how much you got saved up? $30,000, $40,000? - I'll have $55,000 once we do this last deal. I need this, Taylor. - You told Donny and Blake yet? - Give me that. Give me that! Give me that! Are you crazy? You shouldn't have done that, Taylor! You think I'm afraid of you? Seriously? Yeah, go on! Get out of here! Go! What? - What the hell? Where is it? - Not even a "thank you"? - Be careful. - I will. - What are you doing here? - I did what you asked. - Get in the car. What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? - I just wanna know why you would drag me into this. - You put yourself into it when you ratted out Meghan's crew. - And you're part of that crew? Nothing more than a drug dealer? - Drug dealer? I have no idea what you're talking about, Miss Reynolds! You think I'm an idiot? - I think you're like me. You just lost your way. - Lost my way! Take some responsibility. I'm nothing like you. - No. You're worse. - I spent my entire life on this job just to be told at the end of 30 years that my pension's gonna be cut in half because some politician burned through the fund! So if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. - Goddamn right! And the warden? Lester Feldman just got in the way of your payoff? He was your friend, Blake. - He was a necessary casualty. - Will you listen to yourself? You know, Meghan's taking off. - There's a hundred Meghans out there. - And now you've got me. - Yeah. Now you're a part of it. - Like it or not. - Are you gonna make trouble for me? - What am I gonna do? Go to the cops? I just took drugs into a jail. They've got me on camera. - Yes, you did. - You son of a bitch! - What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? I just wanna know why you would-- - Everything OK? - She got Blake. She's coming back. Where's Bianca? - The bathroom. What do you want? - I don't know how you live with yourself. You had me thrown in segregation for 6 months. All I asked is that you just do the one simple thing in return. And, instead, you try to destroy me? - That's not what this is about. - 'Cause, you know, you got the house, you got the family, you got everything! And what do I got? -Meghan! Bianca! Meg-- - You meet me back at the river. - Where is she? Bianca! Let her go. - How about I sell her to you for $40,000? - You know we don't have that kind of money. - You don't got that money? - Where is she? - Come on! Come on, Tay! Pull the trigger! - I swear to God, if you have hurt her in any way... - You'll never find where she is. - Meghan! Meghan, please! Please, Meghan! Don't do this. Please! Where is she? - So, you're really not part of my world. - No! Just tell me! Tell me what I need to do! - How about you apologize for betraying me! - I'm sorry. - See, I don't even believe that you are sorry. - I had to think about myself. I had to protect my family. - You're so pathetic. I should shoot you. - No, what are you doing? - I'm leaving! That's what I'm doing! - No, no, no! - You call the cops, I'll kill her! - Where is she? - I will kill her! This isn't over! - No! - I want my money! - Bianca! Bianca! - I want my money! - No! No! - I want my money! - HELP! - Bianca? Mom! Help me! Aaah! - Bianca! Bianca! I'm coming! - Help! Help! Help! - Bianca, I'm coming! Mama's coming! Help me! - I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! - Help me! Help! - OK! I got it! I got it! My baby! My baby! Baby, come here! Come around here! OK! I got you! I got you, baby! You're OK. You're OK. You're OK. Come on. Let's go home. OK! I got you. OK! Let's get you home. - What? - Put it back! - No! - Put it back! - I want it. So, they never found her? You know, I knew she was bad news that time she came in here. Mrs. Reynolds, as an apology to you, and as a gesture of thanks from the community, the groceries are on the Crisp Market today. - Thanks, but that's not necessary. - Mom, why do you hate free stuff? - Grab a bag. - Jeez! - Got everything? - Yeah. Mom got offered free groceries, and she refused. - Well, good for you. - Yeah.
