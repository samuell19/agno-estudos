You shouldn't have done that, Doug. This is goodnight. Just a moment. Have a heart. No. Don't you realize it's after two? So what? - So, goodnight. Who is that watching us? It's my cousin, Frank. You don't have to spy on us, Frank. Come out and be introduced. Good evening. Frank, this is Douglas Keene. Someone else who wants to marry you for your money? That is not a bit funny. It really doesn't matter to me in the least you know. I get my share of the estate anyway. Wilma always told me you were unpleasant. I call that a magnificent understatement. I'm so sorry, Doug. - That's alright, dear. I don't mind. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Who is that out there? Who is that? Come here. Who is that on the stairs? Nurse. Nurse! Come here. - What is it now, Mr Laxter? There is somebody prowling in the hall. See who it is. You are imagining things. I never heard a sound. Of course not. You were asleep. Ha! A fine nurse you are. I might be killed in here and you'd never hear it. Mr Laxter, you mustn't excite yourself. I'll excite myself as much as I want. Go out and see who it is and bring them in here. Wilma. - Hello, nurse. Put on your slippers. - Did grandfather hear me? He certainly did. He wants to see you. How is he? Is he any worse? He is always worse. Hello, darling. - I thought so. I thought so. I'm terribly sorry if I woke you up. I wasn't asleep. Don't fool yourself. And stop fiddling around. You can go to bed. It is time for your medicine. - I don't want any. Go to bed. I never did like that woman anyway. Darling, how can you sleep in such a messy-looking bed? And what in the name of goodness is all that junk? Nothing. Just going through some old papers. Where did they all come from? They were in storage. I had Ashton bring them. What's in here? - Nothing. Old papers. Leave them alone! Alright, darling. Don't snap at me. Where have you been? I was out with a young man. With who? With whom, darling. Whom. You were out with Johnny Bricker. Wrong again. I was out with Douglas Keene. But darling, he is so nice. - Yes. We're going to .. How do you know for sure he isn't only interested in the money you get from me? You say that about all my friends. [ Cat meow ] [ Cat meow ] [ Cat meow ] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty. Come. Come back. That's it. Nice kitty. Nice kitty. Nice kitty. Listen, grandfather. Something has got to be done about that blasted cat. It doesn't make half as much noise as you do throwing things at it. Smashing glass. I'll poison it. That's what I'll do. The beastly animal keeps me awake all night. Have a heart, Sam. The cat is in love. Haven't you been in love? You'll not molest Clinker anymore. You'll pay for that broken glass. Now get out. Alright. If my sanity is less important to you than the caretaker's cat, I'll .. Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight. Sleep tight. - Yes. [ Telephone ] Hello? Hello. I want some legal work done. Laxter. Legal work. Yes, Mr Laxter. I want to change my will. Before morning. But my dear sir. It is past 2:30. I know what time it is. If you charge extra for late calls you can put it on the bill. Alright. Nurse. Nurse! What is it this time, Mr Laxter? - I've sent for my attorney. I want you to go down to the caretaker and tell him he is on his way. He will have to open the door for him. And stop fiddling around. I like the bed this way. I won't be more than a few minutes. - Very good, sir. Good morning, Sam. - Good morning, rather. Taking a little moonlight stroll? What you doing here at this time of the morning, Mr Mason? That's what I want to know. Your grandfather phoned me and said he wanted to see me about something urgent. Is he getting worse? - I hope so. I hate people when they are old. They are just a nuisance. If ever I reach that age, which I doubt. I hope someone will have the kindness to do away with me. [ Buzzer ] Hello, Ashton. Well, hello Clinker. Friendly little beast, isn't he. You should be that way too if people had been throwing things at you. Ashton. What is all this about anyway? Don't ask me, Mr Mason. I don't know. I'm only the caretaker around here. All I am told is to get dressed and open the door for you. You are to go right upstairs to his room. Ashton. I warn you for the last time. If that cat bothers me again, I'll kill it. I swear I will. I haven't had a wink of sleep. That is too bad. Now, is that all clear? Certainly. You want your will changed so that your granddaughter Wilma .. Shush. Find out if that woman is listening at the door. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you? I was just fixing Mr Laxter's medicine. Yeah. Then you got your medicine and I am glad of it. You were eavesdropping. I'll give it to him. I won't take it. Throw it out the window. And now, as we were saying. You want your will changed .. So that your granddaughter Wilma is cut out entirely. Right. And then she'll see which of the fellows hanging round her is truly on the level. And you want your estate to go in equal portions to your two grandsons. Sam Laxter and frank Oafley. - That's right. And don't forget the cat. Oh yes. The caretaker's cat. Your heirs are to continue to employ Ashton the caretaker. And he must always be permitted to have the company of his cat? That's right. Now, will you tell me why you wanted all this attended to at this ungodly hour? Couldn't you have waited until the morning? I may not be alive in the morning. You look like a pretty healthy invalid to me. I don't anticipate death as a result of ill health. [ Cat squalling! Loud ] What in the name of heaven was that? - That is only the caretaker's cat. Get out of here. Good morning, Mr Oafley. - Good morning, Ashton. Want anything done in town? I'm going in to do some errands for Mr Laxter. No. Nothing for me, I guess. Well, good morning, nurse. How is the patient? He is well enough to be very fussy about his breakfast. Oh, Ashton is going into town. Is there anything you want? I've everything I need. Thank you, sir. I say. Would you be good enough to close the garage doors after me, sir? Yeah, sure. - Thank you, sir. Darling. Careful, darling. Someone may see us. I don't care. Let them. I'm tired of acting like a stranger when people are around. Listen. I came in a minute ago and no-one was here. The engine of the roadster was running. I looked around and saw Sam coming. Then I turned it off. - Sam? Did he see you? - No. He was in too much of a temper. - Why? He saw Clinker and then he tripped over the hose. Hello Wilma. Come right in. Hello, Mr Mason. Won't you sit down? - We can only stay a minute. Well, I am delighted to see you young man, but just who are you? I am so sorry. I forgot. Mr Mason - Douglas Keene. - How do you do. We're going to marry. In spite of the will? - I'm tickled to death. I don't like girls with money. They get to bossy. Mr Mason, why have I been cut out of my grandfather's will? My dear, I haven't the remotest idea. I can't understand it. Grandfather just called us into the room and bluntly said I won't get a nickel. He said Frank and Sam would have it all and gave no explanations. What were your reactions? She told him to sit on a tack. Then she bagged her things and moved right out. That's the girl. And what are your plans? Do you like waffles? Beg your pardon? I'm opening a waffle shop quite near here. See, I've saved money from my allowance and that way I'll be independent. Do you think it's a good idea, Mr Mason? Well, on one condition. What's that? I can't approve of any waffle shop unless you serve lots of melted butter. Melted butter it is. - When are you going to open? Right away. - I'll be your first customer. That is, if you don't take mine. Mr Laxter wishes to speak to Mr Perry Mason. It's very important. I'm sorry. Mr Mason is terribly busy. Well, hold the wire. I'll see if he can talk to you. Listen sister, I've been waiting an hour to see Perry Mason. How long will he be? I am sorry. He is terribly busy. Mister Mason. Mister Mason. Unless you know a 7-letter word starting with "X" meaning a Mongolian lizard. I don't want to talk to you. But Mr Mason, this is very .. - Tell you what I'll do, Della. I'll settle for a 7-letter beginning with "S" meaning lawyer. Shyster. Getting a bit fresh aren't you, Della? What do you want? There is a Mrs Pixley on the telephone. She says it's very important. Pixley, Pixley? I know no-one named Pixley. If I did I wouldn't talk to them over the phone. She says she is Mr Peter Laxter's housekeeper. Oh. Yes? It's Perry Mason speaking. Give me that phone if that's Mason. Hello. I have just signed my will, Mason. Yes. I am sending it over to you now by your driver. Put it in your safe deposit box and keep there until you hear from me. I'll take care of it. You work your own crossword puzzles, young woman. What is that? No, Mr Laxter. I am sorry. I wasn't talking to you. Yes, sir. I will take care of it. Give that to Mr Mason's driver. Tell him to take it to Mr Mason right away. Alright. Goodbye. When will you men be through here? Oh, we'll be out of here in a couple of hours. You can start selling waffles by tonight. Extra, extra! All about the big fire! Millionaire dies in big blaze! Read all about it. Extra! Here, boy. Thank you. Read it! Millionaire dies in blaze. Read all about it. Mr Mason, would you like to see a man about a cat? Ashton? Sure, send him in. Come in, Mr Ashton. Good morning, Ashton. How are you? Glad to see you. What can I do for you? - You can do plenty, I guess. Sam Laxter wants to get rid of my cat and I want you to stop him. You still work as caretaker in the household, don't you? You can bet your sweet life I do. That was in the will. But Sam says that don't include my cat. He says if I don't get rid of him he'll poison him. Well .. what do you want me to do? You can help me if you want to Mr Mason, and I can pay. I know that you big attorneys don't work for little apples. But if you'll just save Clinker for me I'll make it worth your while. You certainly have plenty of money anyway. Did Mr Laxter leave that to you? Not a dime. He just said I was to be kept on at my job. I've worked for him for twenty years. Fifty a month and all found. I've saved my money, I have. Well, you needn't worry about a thing. I'll send a letter to Sam Laxter and throw a good scare into him. How much will that cost? - Don't bother .. I got it, chief. I said how much will it cost me? Look. It fits, chief. It fits. - Just a minute, please. Don't you worry about a thing, Mr Ashton. Leave two dollars with the girl as a retainer and I'll save your cat for you. Two dollars? - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Hey, chief. What is on your mind? - Monoecious. What? - Monoecious. A 10-letter word meaning a flower with a single stamen. It fits, chief. Look. I solved that puzzle last Tuesday. - Look here, Mr Mason. What's the matter? - Somebody follows your caretaker. Della. Did you notice the roll of bills that Mr Ashton was carrying? I wonder where he got it. Drake, did you make those enquiries for me? Yeah. You know me, chief. Here we are. I got the dope at the bank. Just about a month before the old boy died .. He sold all his stocks and bonds and cashed in for about a million bucks. A million fish, chief. In currency. That's a lot of money to have around. I wonder what he did with it. That's what the heirs would like to know. Well, perhaps it was burned in the fire? Della, take a letter. To Sam Laxter. "Dear Sir." "My client, Mr Charles Ashton." "Has consulted me regarding his cat Clinker." I know you, Perry Mason. You are trying to rig this will. What is the meaning of this letter to my client? It's all very simple, Mr Shuster. I want my client to keep his cat. Don't let him bluff you with the cat. He is trying to break her will. You were hired to .. - Calm yourself, Mr Shuster. I drew the will. I have no possible interest in trying to break it. Don't you represent my cousin Wilma who was cut out of the will? I do not. I represent the cat. Didn't you tell me that Wilma was behind all this? Sure she is. Don't let Mason fool you. You're a very clever man Mr Mason, but you .. But you are much cleverer, counsellor. I know. Mr Laxter, you know I'm sort-of sorry you retained Mr Shyster. Mr Shuster. Forgive me. You see he is .. - Let's get down to brass tacks. Mister Mason. Here is what my client is prepared to do. He'll guarantee not to molest the cat on one condition. And what is that? I want a waiver. From Wilma Laxter guaranteeing not to contest the will. I told you I don't represent Wilma. Very well then. No waiver .. no cat. I advise you Mr Laxter to leave the cat out or you'll be left out in the cold. What did I tell you? He's trying to break her will. He represents Wilma. But you won't succeed. You're bluffing. Good day, counsellor. Good day, Mr Laxter. I am awfully busy. You'll forgive me, won't you. I think we should have charged a larger fee for representing that cat. Della, I think you are right. Don't be so mercenary. You just sit back and watch the fur fly. Yes? Speaking. Where are you, Drake? Fine. I'll be right over. Where are you off to now? Waffles and melted butter. So then I get on the trail of DeVoe. Alert, see. And I find out where she is at. Here is the address here. Then. I mosey around to the bank. - Yes. You were right, chief. Ashton's got a safety deposit box there. He rented it about a month ago. Just before the old man died. 2 days after he rents it he returns and rents another box for his half-brother. A guy named Watson Clammert. I didn't know he had one. - Well, he has. He's at the general hospital. They tell me at the hospital, Ashton his half-brother, paid all his expenses. Drake .. you know there are times when I think you're not as dumb as you look. Now I can give you some time, Mr Mason. My customers are leaving. Sit down, Wilma. Better make it snappy. I may have to make more waffles any minute. They're very tasty too. Will there be some trouble about the will? It all depends on the cat. - On Clinker? Yeah. Your cousin Sam wants to poison him. A nice boy. Oh, darling, come here. Glad to see you, Keene. - Hiya. Doug, this is Paul Drake, investigator for Mr Mason. Douglas Keene. - How are you. That's right. Douglas Keene. I got the dope on him too. Here it is right here. Douglas Keene, unemployed architect. Works in a filling station. Who is this man? What is all this? It's alright, darling. I told you. He is a sort-of investigator. Well, I don't care to be investigated. Why do you always gum up the works? But chief you said to get a line on .. - Let's call on nurse DeVoe. Pay the check. Louise DeVoe? She sounds more like a chorus girl than a nurse. What are you going to tell her, chief? - She is the one who is going to tell. I hope. [ Buzzer ] Who is that? [ Buzzer ] Is that you, Frank? Good afternoon, Miss DeVoe. May we come in a moment? What do you want, Mr Mason? - Just a little information. This is my assistant, Paul Drake. You're expecting someone, aren't you. No. Then why did you say: "Is that you, Frank?" when I rang? That would be Frank Oafley wouldn't it? Suppose you tell me what you want to know, Mr Mason. I have an engagement. Oh. Make yourself at home mister whatever-your-name-is. I'd like to know how that fire started. Have you any idea? No. Have you? Come on DeVoe, quit stalling. You know plenty and if you're a smart dame .. Now take it easy, Drake. Take it easy. I understand from Sam Laxter that .. Has Sam been saying things against me? If he has he is a liar. Do you want to know something about Sam Laxter? Well, I would like a little information. If you want to know what I think .. He knows a great more about the fire than he'll admit. I think he had something to do with it. Why? There was something very funny going on in the garage. I went out to get something for my patient. The garage was empty. But the engine of Sam's car was running. When was this? - The day before the fire. After a while, Sam came in and drove away. There was a rubber tube connected to his exhaust. That led directly to the furnace. That's all very interesting. Have you told anyone about this? No, I .. You may as well tell the truth, Miss DeVoe. Well, Yes. I .. I did tell Frank. And what did he say? - He told me to keep quiet. He said I'd get into trouble telling things like that. But if Sam wants to send you and this detective of yours to snoop around. If he implies I had anything to do .. - I'm not representing Sam. I am that attorney for the cat, Clinker. Sam wanted to poison it. Do you know why? Sam didn't like cats or old men. He said that they should all be put out of their misery. I see. Anything else you want to know, Mr Mason? Not just now, Miss DeVoe. You've been a great help. Thanks very much. Come on, Drake. The insurance companies found everything in order. They paid up. Insurance companies, Mr Burger, have one thing in common with district attorneys. They don't always know everything. [ Buzzer ] Hello? Dr Jacobs? Just have him come right in. Evening, Mr Burger. Sorry I am late. I came over as quick as I could. Hello Perry. What gives out? Sit down, doctor. Mason wants to ask you something about gasoline vapours. This is the problem, doctor. A man has been burnt to death by fire. But I have reason to believe that he was murdered by exhaust fumes. Before the fire started. Could an autopsy determine that? Yes. Provided the remains were available. How about it, Mr District Attorney? Do I get the order to examine the body? Wouldn't there be a trace of the poisoning element in any event? If a man perished in a fire. There certainly would. Then what do we gain? - That's not the whole story, doctor. What I want to know is this. Could you determine by examination .. If the man was dead before the fire started? Yes. Would the blisters produced by the fire on the body of the dead man .. Differ from those on the body of a man burned to death? Show me the blisters and I'll tell you. Okay. You win. Here's the milk you ordered. - Alright. Put it down somewhere. I'm busy. Looking for something? I'll ring if I need you again. If you are looking for the Koltsdorf diamonds you are wasting your time. Your cousin Frank has been over this room a dozen times with a comb. [ Telephone ] Mr Samuel Laxter's residence. Let me speak to Ashton the caretaker please. Just a moment. It is someone for Ashton. - Alright. You may go. Won't you come in and sit down? Thanks. - Shush. Hello Ashton? This is Perry Mason. Yes, Mr Mason? No, sir. No-one ain't poisoned him yet. He's right here now. You needn't worry any more, Ashton. Sam Laxter won't have time to molest your cat. No. He'll be too busy answering district attorney's questions. Hold on. Wait a minute, Mr Mason. I don't want this thing to go too far. Who lives here now? Sam Laxter, Frank Oafley and three servants. Hurry up with those keys. - Right. Let me have the flashlight. Put that light on over there. - Okay. There it is. She said it was a roadster, chief. Look. Something has been clamped down on this. Open it up. Well, Burger, have I still brought you on a wild goose chase? We'll go and question him right away. Who is there? Who is that by the garage? Hello, Mr Oafley. A delightful evening, isn't it. - Yes. This is District Attorney Burger. My assistant Drake. How do you do. Oafley? Frank Oafley. Frank Oafley. That's correct. I hope we haven't alarmed you. No. I just couldn't figure who it was prowling around. You seem to have scratched your hands rather badly. Yes. This confounded rose bush is right in my way. Rather an odd time to be gardening. Or were you just digging? As a matter of fact Mr Mason, I was digging for treasure. Treasure? Really? The Koltsdorf diamonds, no doubt. Yes. - What? Old man Laxter fell for some diamonds. Since the fire there's no sign of them. What made you think they were out here? Well .. a telegram I received about half an hour ago. There it is. Who sent this? You know as much about it as I do. - Well, did you find them? No, but we certainly looked every place else for them. Say Mr Oafley, I'd like to ask you and your cousin a few questions. Alright. Let's go in the house. Brandon, what are you doing there? Has Mr Laxter come in yet? Not yet, sir. - Let me know when he does. In the meantime. Make us some Highballs, will you. - Very good, sir. You'd better put some iodine on those scratches. These? Oh, they are nothing. We gardeners get used to that. Mr Oafley, did Miss DeVoe inform you of her suspicions about the exhaust fumes? Exhaust fumes? Miss DeVoe? I wouldn't be top innocent if I were you, Mr Oafley. Better tell me all that you know. Mr Laxter. What happened, sir? It's alright. Don't be alarmed. Just had a little smash-up. Nothing serious. The District Attorney and Perry Mason are here to see you, sir. The D.A.? What for? We are trying to determine Mr Laxter if you know who murdered your grandfather. I suggest Mr Burger that you quiz Mr Laxter at once. Call Wilma. I want to speak with her. - Right. [ Buzzer ] Never mind. I'll answer it. Better take those drinks into the library. Mr Laxter looks as though he needs one. Hello counsellor. Come in. What are you doing here? - Roller-skating. Boo! Where is Sam? Where is my client? What is going on here? Step right this way, counsellor. Calm yourself. I will do all the talking. They've exhumed the body. They're trying to frame you. I'll take care of everything. What have you been trying to do with my client? What's happened to you? Has he been trying to give you the third degree? This is not the middle ages you know. You can't torture your witnesses. Calm yourself, Mr Shuster. I saw everything. I was hiding behind a tombstone. I saw them exhume the body. Okay, chief. Hello Wilma. This is Perry Mason speaking. Hello, Mr Mason. I'm so glad you called. I have tried to reach you everywhere. I can't talk very well here. I have some customers. But something terrible has happened. Can you please come over? Yes. Gladly. Thank you, Mr Mason. I'll see you later. Why don't you question Mr Mason's client the caretaker? Why bother Mr Laxter? Why don't .. Oh, shut up. What's all this about Koltsdorf diamonds and cats? And a missing million dollars? It is a bit confusing, isn't it. Why don't you call Ashton? Mr Laxter has rung for him but he doesn't answer. He's usually somewhere in the basement. Let's go find him. Come on, Drake. - Yeah. That is the door, right there. Ashton. Dead. Hey, look at those tracks. Right over the poor man's face. Say, that is very interesting. Do you see any cats around here? - Probably jumped out again. Where are you off to now? You'll have plenty to do until I come back. I have a sudden desire to consume some waffles. Waffles? - Yeah. Waffles. [ Door knocks ] Hello Wilma. Sorry I am late. I am so glad you are here, Mr Mason. - You say you're in trouble. What is it? Great Caesar's ghost, what is it this? - That's Clinker. Clinker? How did he get here? Douglas Keene brought him. Tell me what happened. Ashton called this afternoon on the phone. He was worried about the cat. He asked me if I'd take care of him for a few days. I said alright. - How did Douglas get into it? He was here at the time so I gave him the key to the house. I still have one although I am not living there. I told him to go over and pick up the cat. What time was this? Well, Doug left about ten. Shortly after, he called from the Laxter house and told me Ashton wasn't there. As a matter of fact he said everyone was out and he asked me what to do. And you told him ..? I told him to wait a while and then if Ashton didn't come back. I said he'd better bring the cat here anyway. About a quarter past eleven he brought the cat here. And then where did he go? I don't know. He said goodnight and left. Are you sure he called you from the Laxter home? Yes. He said he was using the extension in Ashton's bedroom. I've just come from that bedroom. Ashton has been murdered. Murdered? - Yes. Mr Mason, do you think Doug could have done it? You don't think .. It isn't what I think, my dear. It's what the police are going to think. Where is Douglas now? I don't know. That is why I asked you to come here. You see, he called me again a little later. He seemed terribly excited and sort of incoherent. He said something about a murder and said for me not to worry. To trust him. Now, now. Please don't cry. You don't think he did it, do you? No. - Neither do I. Now listen. If Clinker is found here you are a cinch to be dragged into this. Come on, cat. You are going for a ride. Wilma, you answer no questions and tell no-one I have been here. You understand? By the way. Did you mention the Koltsdorf diamonds to Douglas? Yes, we talked about them. He had a theory that Ashton probably had them. I mean, I thought Ashton had them. But he thought Miss DeVoe might know more than she told. Miss DeVoe? [ Cat meow ] Now, now catty. Come on, Clinker. Maybe you are right. Alright Wilma. You don't worry about a thing. You'll hear from me. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr Mason. Come on, Clinker boy, Come on. [ Door knocks ] Good evening, Della. - Good evening, my eye. Do you know it's nearly two o'clock in the morning? What on earth have you got there? Love brings a gift. Have you gone mad? You woke me up just to bring me a horrible-looking cat? This is Clinker. Keep the beast here. See he doesn't get out. But why? What ..? - I'll tell you at the office tomorrow. Well, now what? I have many things to do, my pet. Nighty-night. Take care of Clinker. Hello. Hello Burger. Mason speaking. What? You'd be surprised. I've found plenty. Let me speak to Drake. Paul. Meet me outside the Victory Arms apartment house in ten minutes. Right. Police headquarters. Homicide bureau. That's right. A woman has been murdered in apartment 7B Victory Arms apartment house. That's right. Wait a minute, boys. I'll see who it is. Say, fellahs. How about piping down so a fellow can get some sleep, huh? I'm sorry, buddy. I thought we were being pretty quiet. You must have heard the celebration next door. Celebration? - Yeah. The dame next door got married. Some of the boys witnessed the ceremony. So, did you rope the happy bridegroom into a poker game on his wedding night? No. We don't even know who it is. I guess they have calmed down now. Listen, fellahs. Keep it quiet will you so I can get some sleep. Okay pal. Sorry we disturbed you. Then I found the janitor. He gave me the lowdown. He told me Sam Laxter and Frank Oafley were there. He knows them. He saw them go into her apartment. So one of them killed her, huh? Take it easy, dismal. And that isn't all. Douglas Keene was there too. 117. That's the number, chief. What do you want? - Does Douglas Keene live here? Yes. But this ain't no time for visitors. Now just a minute. I am Perry Mason, his attorney. It is very important that I see him. First door at the end of the hall. - Thank you. Look, chief: blood stains. - Don't touch them. Well. Poor Wilma. She thought he was such a nice guy too. Drake. Use the phone in the hall. Call Wilma. Ask if she's heard from Keene. Right. And don't tell her about these. - Okay, chief. Can I help you, mister? - Yes. What time did Keene leave? I don't know. What happened? - Did he have any visitors today? Yes. There was a man called here late this evening. What did he look like? Gosh mister, I don't know. I've 20 rooms here. People coming in all the time. Anybody else called? Come on now. Think hard. Think hard. Yes. Miss DeVoe called. DeVoe? - But that was earlier. Left word for Keene to call her. He took the message and left at once. Did you see Keene come back? No, I was asleep. - I see. Thanks. Here's my card. If you hear from Keene tell him to call me immediately. Yes, sir. Is Mr Keene in a jam of some sort? - I'll say he is. You'll probably have the police here in 5 minutes. Don't you tell them I was here. Understand? Yeah, yeah. Okay, lady. Don't worry. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well, what did you find out? - He was there, chief. Is he there now? - No. He stopped in to say goodbye. She said he was in some kind of jam and was very excited. He wouldn't give any explanation. She tried to hold him there but the guy ducked. Not bad for Burger. Here come the police now. We'd better find Keene before he does. Step on it, Drake. - Right. Hey, justice. Give me a 7-letter word beginning with a "P". Meaning "obsolete Tahitian coin". Well. I have had very little experience in numismatics I fear. When will Mr Mason be back? I have some papers to notarize and I .. Yeah, I know. He's on his way over here now. That was him on the phone a few minutes ago. And when I told him that you were here and couldn't wait .. He said to hold you here if I had to knock you stiff. I'll wait. - You're smart. Here he comes now. What a break, chief. What a break. Here is the guy that married DeVoe to Frank Oafley last night. No. Yes, Mr Mason. I performed the ceremony. And when I read in the papers this morning. Of this terrible tragedy to the bride. I thought perhaps I could give you some information. You bet your sweet life you can. Take this down, Della. What time were you at the apartment house? About ten o'clock. - Were there witnesses to the ceremony? Yes, Mr Mason. Two gentlemen from the apartment next door. They were playing poker. Their names were .. Never mind names. What time did you leave the apartment? Now that I can tell you with great accuracy. - Fine. It was exactly 10:17 when I stepped into my car. You see, I had a little accident. A crumpled fender which I reported to my insurance company. Was this outside the apartment house? - Yes, Mr Mason. I was parked directly behind another car and in pulling out .. I damaged my fender and scratched the paint off the other car. I see. Did you notice the other car? - Yes. It was a black touring car. It was empty, but I got the name of the owner. Now let me see. Here it is. Watson Clammert. Watson Clammert? That is Ashton's half-brother. Did you get the license number? - Oh, naturally, naturally. Here it is. - Della. Call the motor department. Find out who bought the car and where it's insured. Better hop down to headquarters to get the information I asked for. Right. - Hurry up. Mr Stillwell. I can't thank you sufficiently for all this information. Not at all. Not at all. By the way. I may have to subpoena you as a witness at the trial of my client Douglas Keene. Will you be willing to testify? - By all means, Mr Mason. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sam Laxter, Frank Oafley and Mr Shuster. Better get your shower curtain. - I'll see them in the outer office. Just a minute, gentlemen. What can I do for you, Mr Shuster? - My client says you're libelling him. You said over the phone yesterday .. That Louise DeVoe accused me of murdering my grandfather. I didn't speak to you on the phone yesterday. You spoke to Ashton. I listened in. Since Ashton and Miss DeVoe are no longer here it'll be difficult to prove. Well it is a lie. An invention of yours. Not mine. You shared Miss DeVoe's suspicions, didn't you? And you discussed it with her. Well, yes. She told me about tubing in the garage but .. I couldn't believe it. - Want to know what I think? I think you married her because you each had so much on the other. And you were afraid one of you may be called to testify. What are you insinuating? You were in the garage. I saw you. Now, boys. Be careful. Let me .. What about the Koltsdorf diamonds? I suppose you didn't order the chauffeur to follow Ashton all the time? You thought he had them, didn't you? - Now Mr Laxter, please. And Mr Oafley, remember I am representing you two. You are not! I am through with you, I'm getting another lawyer. You are a shyster. You know Mr Laxter I am inclined to agree with your cousin in that respect. Goodbye, counsellor. What a break, Della. We've got them fighting among themselves. [ Telephone ] Yes? Yes. I just got the report of the autopsy, sir. Listen. Ashton was killed at approximately ten-thirty. Not later. Alright. Fine, Paul. Yes. Ten-thirty, eh? But Mr Keene was in the house from ten to eleven. He certainly was. That looks pretty bad for Keene doesn't it. What are you looking so pleased about? Della. I am thinking about the caretaker's cat. Come on, Mr Burger. What is the dope on Keene? We haven't found him yet, but we will. Yeah? Have you got a case against him? Tight as a drum. He was seen leaving DeVoe's apartment. My men searched his rooms and found bloodstained clothing. Then the kid ran away. Yes? Holcomb? Yeah. Send him right in. Chief, I got something here that will interest you. This is Clinker, the caretaker's cat. I checked up on that guy Mason like you said. I found out that late last night he took this cat to his secretary's apartment. And left it there with her. - Get him on the wire. No. Wait a minute. We'll go and see him. See that cat is locked up and meet me downstairs. Do come in, gentlemen. Wait a minute. I must talk to you too. Listen, Mason. - Splendid work, Burger. Splendid work and let me congratulate you. You have it all solved, haven't you. Where is Douglas Keene? I wish I knew. You took the words right out of my mouth. Mason, you are up to your tricks again. Della, what does the gentleman mean? Why did you take that cat to her apartment last night? He didn't .. - There's no used lying. My men searched your apartment this morning after you left. I have the cat in my office. Where did you get that cat? And why did you try to hide it? - Now just a minute, Mr Burger. Can't a gentleman give a lady a cat? And a gentleman cat at that. Without being browbeaten right here in his own office? I'm not trying to browbeat you. The phone is ringing. Do you mind if my secretary answers? No. Alright, Della. Answer the phone. Mr Mason's office. Mason. You know where Douglas Keene is. And if you don't turn him over by noon I will have you disbarred. Just a moment. Mr Mason. It is your aunt Effie. - Oh. My aunt Effie. Excuse me, won't you. - Hmm. Hello, aunt Effie. Yes. And then I got back and saw the papers. I phoned Wilma and she said I should call Mr Mason. Yes I am very busy right now, dear. Yes. Yes, the district attorney is here and one of his great big detectives. That's right. You understand, don't you? I get you, Mr Mason. I'm at the corner of 10th and Alameda, in the drugstore. No cops in sight. Oh, that is awful, aunt Effie. Yes dear, of course. You stay right there and I'll come right over. That's right, dear. Poor thing had a bad accident. She tried to curl her hair with curling irons last night and burned herself. Why, she is having hysterics. I must go over and calm her down and you must help me. Come on, Della. You don't mind, do you gentlemen? Excuse me and I'll see you later. Yes, but I .. Burger is following you. Bless his heart. Of course he is. You and your cat. You'll probably end up in jail. There's a lot of interesting people in jail, Della. Better hurry. They're by the corner. - I know it. Hello Burger. I thought you had lost me for a minute. Just going in to get some medicine for my aunt Effie. Say. You'd better not double-park. You are apt to get a ticket. He is so good to his relatives, Mr Burger. You can't imagine. Mr Mason, I .. Hello, George. Can I use your prescription room? - Sure Perry. Help yourself. I didn't do it, Mr mason. I swear it. - I know, I know. Tell me exactly what happened. Louise DeVoe left a message in your rooming-house? Yes. She had something important to tell me. When I got to her place I found her dead on the floor. Anyone see you? - Yes. That's why I got panicky. Did you touch the body? - No, sir. Now, don't lie to me. How did your suit get so bloody? I don't know. I .. Your landlord said you had a visitor yesterday. Who was it? It must have been after I left. I went home and packed some things and .. Then I got scared they'd pin something on me and I beat it. What's that? That my boy, is the D.A. to whom I turn you over in a moment. But I didn't do it. - Wait. That's for me to prove. - I tell you .. Will you relax please, Keene. Take it easy. Tell me just this. You went to the Laxter house to get the cat. What time did you leave? - About eleven. Were you in Ashton's room. - Yes, sir. See anyone? - No-one. You took the cat with you. Is that it? - Yes, I took him over to Wilma's. What has Clinker to do with it? Clinker my boy is going to save your life. Now just relax and take it easy. Do you know Perry Mason? - Yes. He's in the prescription room. Hello Burger. What are you doing here? - Meet my client, Douglas Keene. Hello. City editor? Do you want to tell them or shall I? Perhaps I'd better, huh. Hello, city editor? Do you want a scoop? This is Perry Mason speaking. Yes. Alright. Here it goes. While the police and district attorney's office were completely baffled .. As to the Laxter killing. Perry Mason, noted criminal attorney, today at noon .. Surrendered Douglas Keene who will stand trial. That's right. Do you want to add anything? - No. Never mind. That's all. Douglas Keene, I arrest you .. - Don't be so formal, Burger. Just call him 'aunt Effie'. Come on, Douglas. Your Honor. The preliminary hearing in this case. Is for the purpose of determining whether there are sufficient grounds .. To hold over the defendant Douglas Keene. For the charge of first degree murder of Louise DeVoe. However, in order to show the motive for that murder. It will be necessary for us to introduce evidence. Relating to the murder of Charles Ashton, the caretaker. Any objections on the part of the defence? We will make our objections at the proper time. Proceed with the case. Did you find anything at the scene of the crime? Yes, sir. - What did you find? It was a stout wooden club. Broken. And it was covered with blood. How did the deceased meet her death? She had been beaten over the head with a club. The skull was fractured. Your witness. Mr Oafley. You testified that on the night of the 23rd you were digging for lost diamonds. You didn't find them, did you. I did not. Did anyone else know of these diamonds? I mean anyone outside the immediate family. Yes. Douglas Keene knew about them. He told me he thought they may be concealed in the crutch. Thank you. Your witness. Mr Oafley. Your hands were badly scratched up that night you were digging, weren't they? Yes. There saw a rose bush nearby. A very thorny one. How were those scratches caused? By the thorns of course. You were there. You saw them. You are sure they weren't caused by a cat? Of course not. Ridiculous. Clinker wasn't there. How'd you know he wasn't there? Did you look for him? It's already been testified that Keene took the cat away. That is all. Oh. Thank you. Dr Jacobs. You examined the body taken from the grave of Peter Laxter. What were your findings? In my opinion, the man had been dead for many hours before the fire started. You made that examination at the request of the District Attorney, didn't you? Yes, sir. At my request. What further examination did you make? I made X-Rays of the hip bone. And you found? I found no evidence of any broken bone. Thank you Dr Jacobs. That is all. Your Honor, I ask for an adjournment. I have just received news of an arrest that will blow this case wide open. I object to any adjournments, Your Honor. It seems necessary at this time to remind the court and defence counsel. The purpose of this hearing has nothing to do with the murder of Peter Laxter. Your Honor. May I request the court to instruct the District Attorney to stick to the facts. If he knows them. Are you implying that .. - Not a bit. I merely say that you don't know what you're talking about. Mr Mason, will you allow Mr Burger to complete his address to the court. If it pleases the court. But he isn't saying anything. Any further interruption and I shall be bound to cite you for contempt of court. Continue Mr Burger, by all means. Mr Mason has wasted enough of the court's time in cross-examining .. Court time is still being wasted, Mr Burger. Mr Mason. Your Honor. We're cross-examining witnesses relative to the death of Peter Laxter. And that Your Honor, is a subject for another hearing. The point is well taken, Mr Mason. This witness off yours. This "Watson Clammert". Does he have any bearing on the specific murder we are investigating? Most decidedly. I refer to the murder of Louise DeVoe. And not to the late Peter Laxter. Exactly. Well, how much time do you want? Until ten tomorrow morning. I'll have the suspect brought here by plane. Court now is session. Proceed with the case. The witness I am about to call Your Honor, can be very helpful. You see, he actually killed Louise DeVoe. Call Watson Clammert. Watson Clammert. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Your Honor, before questioning the witness .. Who has been considered dead for many months. I think it's helpful if I return to the night of the fire .. In which he was meant to have perished .. And explain the chain of events which brought us to this hearing. "Mr Laxter was not the invalid that he seemed." "His hip had healed well enough to enable him to walk." "Mr Laxter knew that one or more of his dear relatives." "He didn't know which." "Was attempting to asphyxiate him." "And he knew moreover." "That they were planning to destroy the evidence by burning the house down." "With the aid of Ashton." "He substituted in the bed." "The body of a dead vagrant named Watson Clammert." "The vagrant had been dead for 24 hours." "The body had been claimed by Ashton." "Who had established himself as the dead man's half-brother." "While Peter Laxter's room was being filled with poison fumes." "Laxter .. aided by Ashton, escaped." Prior to his supposed death. Peter Laxter sold stocks and bonds valued at over a million dollars. This money was placed in a safe deposit box under the name of Watson Clammert. The Koltsdorf diamonds were hidden in the caretaker's crutch. He then remained in hiding under the name of Watson Clammert. Now. We know on the night of the 23rd. Douglas Keene went to the Laxter residence to get the cat. And that Ashton was not in the house. Keene left after eleven with the cat. Ashton's death occurred at ten-thirty. Where was Ashton? "Ashton arrived at Louise DeVoe's apartment house." "He was seen going in." "By Peter Laxter .. who was hidden in the shadows." "Frank Oafley and Louise DeVoe had just been married." "Whether it was a love match .." "Or whether they married so that they could not testify against each other .." "Is immaterial." "They got rid of the Justice as quickly as they could." "Because they had an appointment with Ashton." "They were convinced the diamonds were concealed in his crutch." "Stillwell came out." "Got into his car." "And had that little accident of which we have already heard." "Meanwhile, up in Louise DeVoe's apartment." I knew all along. The two of you. You fixed that thing down there in the garage .. So the gas would go upstairs and poison Mr Laxter. Didn't think I knew that, did you? And another thing. You think that I've got the diamonds in here, don't you? Well, they are .. That Your Honor, occurred at ten-thirty. The question now arises. How did the body of Ashton get back to his own room? That was quite simple. "The apartment was on the second floor." "Oafley, a powerful man." "Picked up the body of Ashton." "Lifted it out of the window and carried it down the fire escape." "And into his car." "He drove immediately back to the house where .." "Ashton's body was lowered onto his own bed." "Which was directly under the window." But where did the muddy cat-tracks on the counterpane and body come from? Clinker had been taken away by Keene. Oafley, knowing that Keene had been there. Found a strange cat and made the tracks himself. In doing so, he was badly scratched. And he sent himself a telegram to furnish an alibi. As he was miles away at the time the murder was committed. He considered himself quite safe. Now. In the meantime. "Louise DeVoe was nervously waiting for the return of her killer groom." "She heard a knock. Putting the diamonds quickly into the desk drawer .." "She opened the door and was horrified .." "By the appearance of the man that she and Oafley thought they had killed." "Laxter wanted to know what they had done with the caretaker." "Seeing the broken crutch." "He demanded the diamonds." "DeVoe opened the desk drawer to get a gun." "Laxter saw the jewels." "As Louise DeVoe took the gun from the drawer." "Laxter in self-defence struck her with the caretaker's crutch." "Now, panic-stricken at what he had done." "Laxter pocketed the diamonds and hurried away." Is that right, Mr Laxter? - Yes, sir. That is just how it happened. We now come to my client Douglas Keene. And his blood-stained suit. "Some minutes after Peter Laxter's hasty departure." "A visitor arrived for Miss DeVoe." "He knocked and getting no answer tried the door which was unlocked." "The visitor was Sam Laxter who had walked from his attorney's office .." "To have a little talk with Miss DeVoe." "He recalled she tried to put the blame on him and he had to put a stop to it." "While he was in the apartment, Douglas Keene knocked on the door." "Sam quickly hid in a closet." "Keene came into the room." "He saw the body and his first impulse was to call the police immediately." "He decided he didn't want to be caught up in this thing and he hurried away." "Sam came out of hiding." "He too was afraid that he would be accused of this murder." "Now, he knew exactly where to throw the blame and probably make it stick." "He rushed out of the apartment." "Jumped into the truck Ashton left there and drove to Keene's rooming-house." "He cut himself with a knife." "And put blood all over one of Keene's suits." "Now he had to find some alibi for those cuts." "So, on his way home .." "He deliberately drove into a fire plug." "Smashed the truck up a bit." "Broke the glass and had a good alibi for his cuts." Your Honor. I move for dismissal of charges against the defendant Douglas Keene. I request that Frank Oafley be held for the murder of Charles Ashton. For the death of Louise DeVoe. Peter Laxter will plead self-defence. And I will defend him. Motion granted. The case of the people versus Douglas Keene is dismissed. The court is adjourned. Thanks, Mr Mason. Nice going, Perry. Don't I get any salt? 0h, I am sorry, Della. Service. Service please. I'll bet in a couple of years we'll have a chain of waffle shops. A wonderful business, love. So I am told. Just what are you trying to do, Mr Mason? Do? Are you tickling my ankle? Why, Della. Well, you certainly are. Do you think that I would .. I am so sorry. I thought it was you. No. But it is a very good idea. -(tg--)---
