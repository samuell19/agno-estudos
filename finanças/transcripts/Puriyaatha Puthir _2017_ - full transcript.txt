We are everything We are the center of attraction We rule the world, Lola Men are just mannequins with mustache Puppets attached to strings We are the ones Who pull those strings, Lola Honey drips down Wherever we look Honey drips down Whenever we talk A fire is kindled Whenever we touch others We rule The earth and the sky Come, Lola The rules written by men Have to be rewritten by us Come, Lola We have to correct those male poets Who refer to us as deer or peacock Come on, Lola In education, we are the victors In sex, we should be the victors We are omnipotent like God Come, Lola Let men cook in the kitchen Be my toy, that is enough Let's break the cages Come, Lola Those who think we are slaves Should be taught a lesson... She is gorgeous, isn't she? There was no chance. Who were you looking at? -Swetha. -What? Wait downstairs. I'll join you. Why? It looks like someone I know is here. Go ahead. I'll be right behind you. -So what? -No, Swetha! You don't get it! Go downstairs and wait at the parking area. Go, Swetha. What's so funny? You're so afraid. Why are you still doing this? I'm not afraid. But I have to be respected in my workplace. If my boss finds out, it will get messy. That's exactly what I mean. Why do you live with the guilt? There's no problem. You'll get it only if you hook up with an older woman! It's nothing to be proud of. Has Buddha started his preaching again? You know that you're doing something wrong. Don't you feel guilty? Everyone does something wrong. But when someone gets caught, we look at the person and say, "Oh, no! How could he do this?" -Right, buddy? -Right. You asked if I feel guilty, didn't you? That's the beauty of it! The irony is attractive. Haven't you noticed it in the movies? The older brother seducing his younger brother's wife. A man being attracted to his wife's sister. These movies become blockbusters. Why? Conflict adds flavor to life. How can you lead a straight path of life? Don't you get bored? When every sinner thinks like that, you know the world is in trouble. Okay, I'll get going. -Stay in touch with the producer. Bye. -Bye. The video you sent me yesterday, the one with no panty, it was so hot! Forget that, check this one out! -Send that one to me. -The girls here were high. They got wild. How could I have left without recording it? -Hey, come on. -Yes, come on. MEERA Keep this inside. MEERA -Speak. -Buddy. Come to the network's office tomorrow evening. I have work in the evening, I can't make it. The producer said he will be there. I've already told him about you. Don't forget to bring your demo CD. Okay, bye. Please wait. He will be here. Call him and find out if he's coming here, or else we must go there and see him. Who is that guy in the coat? He is the Managing Director! Your friends? Is he the poor husband? And he actually trusts you? -We should build a statue to honor him. -Why do you want to jinx it? Why would someone look for a substitute if the existing one performs well? That was superb. Whose composition was that? Well... If I order an instrument, would you deliver it to my place? Sure. You want a piano? I do want a piano, but not now. I want a violin. We have a violin there. You can take it with you. But I want a red violin. It might take a week or so to arrive. Right, Chandru? Yes. Yes, one week. That's all right, but I need it to be home-delivered. Write down your address and the name of the instrument you want. It will be delivered to you after one week. ONE WEEK LATER You came here at this hour? You delivered it yourself? Don't you have delivery boys? I came to learn what you played last time. Your place was on the way, so I came to deliver it myself. -Okay, give it to me. -Will you not invite me in? Please have a seat. -Oh, Meera. -Yes? -Can I get you anything? -No, thank you. But if you insist, I won't refuse. -Is that your class picture? -Yes. -Shall I spot you in the picture? -Sure, go ahead. Let's see. You'll see! That's you! At the rightmost side, right? How did you find out? I've been quite brilliant since childhood. The same eyes and curly hair. Don't curse me if it isn't good. Actually, that isn't my photo. That is my roommate's photo. Maybe, you and your roommate look alike. Just drink your coffee. So, is she inside? She works in the IT industry. So she comes home late. What do you do? I work as a part-time music teacher at Alliance Francaise. I joined only six months ago. You don't look like someone who works at the music shop full-time. My friend owns the shop, and I manage it for him. I'm a music director. Why? Don't I look like one? No, I just didn't expect it! I'm trying to release an album. -I'll get going. -Okay. One second. If I need to get the violin repaired, -should I bring it to the shop? -No need. Write down my number. -99520... -75435... My name is Kathir. Kathir, this is my roommate, Pooja. You know she was alone, so you came here to meet with her? Oh, no. I came to deliver the violin. Really? Don't get scared. I was just asking. Come in, dear. What is it? A phone call? Yes, Kathir? You tried calling me? No, I didn't call you. I got a missed call from you, so I returned the call. Maybe I misdialed or something. I didn't call you. Okay, no problem. -Are you fine? -I'm fine, how about you? I'm good. SORRY FOR? I MISDIALED... I have lost myself, beloved SORRY FOR? NOW I MISDIALED A dream resides now in my heart My vision is getting blurred My senses have awakened They are trying to tell me something There's an angel before my eyes I feel pain in my soul When our conversation ends Why does the heart yearn for more? Neither a thing to speak of Nor a thing to listen to But my mind yearns for it There's an angel before my eyes I feel pain in my soul WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE DRESS? MY SCHOOL UNIFORM! CAN I SEE YOU WEARING IT? WELL... OR WITHOUT WEARING ANYTHING? DUDE... DUDE? YES, DUDE... FORGET IT! When I see your intoxicating eyes I lose my way But the journey still continues I lose myself in your enchanting smile And I see heaven Even though The season's first rain has drenched me Why is my heart still parched? Even though I get drenched In the rain daily Why is my heart longing for more rain? When I am being hugged I can feel the warmth of your hands The words you say travel across the wind And make me feel heavy The angel is before my eyes But still I am pining for her A dream now resides in my heart My vision is getting blurred My senses are awakened They are trying to say something This is DJ, this is Vinod. And this is Meera. Great! Meera, do you like me? I don't like you. -Kathir. -Yes? How many girlfriends have you had? So far, just one. Is this for real? Or just a dream? What do you think? I think this is for real. Meera, if I try to kiss you now, will you get mad? Oh, god! We're done for. Get going. I knew it the moment I first saw you, you're a cheat. Go! Go away! Are you his partner in crime? -Oh, no! -Crazy girl! So annoying! Yes? -Where are you? -I'm at the studio. What is it? I came over to the music shop to see you. Meera, I'm busy with work. I'll talk to you later. -Okay? -Kathir, one moment. Yes, Meera? Kathir, today is my birthday. Oh, it's your birthday? Okay? "A duplicate key to gain access to a beautiful heart." I feared the worst when you acted cold to me over the phone. What is a birthday without a surprise? Do you like it? For scaring you? This isn't all. I've arranged a dinner party tonight. My friends will be there, too. I'll be happy if you wear this dress. -Shall we? -Okay. You are incarnated into me And blended with me I am lost in you, my dear You are incarnated in me And blended with me I am lost in you, my dear -Have a safe trip. -Okay. Where is Vinod? He must be somewhere with that married woman as usual. Avoid the Kathipara Flyover on the way back. -Shall we go? -Yes. Hop on! -Where is Vinod? -He's busy. Let's get going. -Okay? -Okay. -Be safe. -Okay. Even for a moment My heart is not ready to part with you -Meera. -Yes? Shall I walk you to your apartment? It's my apartment. I will manage. How about a cup of coffee? We can have it in the morning. -Shall I leave then? -Go now, Kathir! -Shall I leave now? -Yes. -I'm really leaving now. -Get going. I hate you. I need to tell you something. Tell me, Meera. -Kathir, -Yes? I... Meera. No. You don't have to say it. Okay? It's nicer when you don't say it. -I get it. -Thank you, Kathir. Yes, Meera? After you dropped me off, it felt like someone was following me. Don't panic. Tell me. What happened? Kathir, after you left, it felt like someone was following me. I rushed back home and locked the door. Meera, you live in an apartment. Sometimes you may feel like you're being followed. -Don't... -No, Kathir. It felt like someone was following me when I stepped out of the elevator. Draw all your curtains and turn on the lights. Okay? Is Pooja home? Not yet, but she should be here soon. -Shall I go back there? -No, Kathir. I feel a lot better now after talking to you. Make sure to text me after Pooja gets home. I'll be waiting! Take care. Look, it's Vinod! The playboy is here. He's not guilty at all for what he did. -Are you out of your mind? -Why? -Did you check Facebook? -What happened? The photos, man! -What photos? -The company page is full of your photos! -What photos... -Hey. The MD is waiting for you. Get going. Look at him. He's walking like he's the MD. He has broken the MD's trust. He's walking so nonchalantly after committing a sin. He has messed with the boss. Traitor! You are a traitor! What are you saying? I don't get it. You don't get it? This isn't me, sir. Shut up, boy. You still take me for a fool? If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. Sir, even if that is me, it's my personal life. What's personal? My wife cheating on me with you is personal? I treated you like a brother and let you into my house! Don't keep standing there. Get out. You filthy bastard, get out! Someone throw this dog out. Get out. I said go! What are you looking at? Get out. Traitor! You are a traitor! If I ever see you again, I will kill you. My wife cheating on me with you is personal? You filthy bastard, get out! It's all because of you! -What did I do? -What do you mean? You encouraged him! He's an idiot! Who commits suicide because of something like this? So what if everyone has discovered his secret? Easy for you to say. You're the one who said irony attracts and conflict adds flavor to life. Such twisted thoughts. Life needs to be peaceful, not interesting. What will we tell his parents about the cause of death? Vinod! My son has left me behind. Vinod, open your eyes and look at me. Vinod! Open your eyes and look at me. Look. It's your mother, Vinod. Vinod. It's really shocking, Kathir. I still can't believe that Vinod committed suicide. What led him to commit suicide? He lost his job. Who commits suicide for losing a job? You guys were always together. You never gave him advice? Let it go, Meera. He's gone. A FEW MONTHS LATER You're carrying a lot of baggage. Have a safe trip. Call me before you board the plane. Okay. I'm saying this again. I'll be gone for six months. Call Geetha and share the room with her. Don't live alone. There's no problem. I can live alone. Don't worry. -I'm here, okay? I'll take care of her. -That's exactly the problem! If you screw up, you'll have to answer me. Okay, then. I'll send you my new number after I arrive there. Let's talk via Skype regularly. -Okay? -Okay, Pooja. Check if you have all the tickets. We're talking here. What are you looking at? It's nothing. Okay, get in. So eager to get rid of me? Okay. -Buzz off! -You're hopeless. -What is it, sir? -What? It's nothing. Wait here, I'll tell you later. -Hello? -Meera, who are you with? What kind of question is that, Kathir? I mean, where are you and who are the people with you? I'm with the kids and an elderly man. What is it, Kathir? Why do you ask? I just felt like talking to you. Kathir, I told you that I want to go shopping. New customers just came in. I'll talk to you later. Yes, buddy? Hey, I've sent you a number. Check if you have it on your contact list. Why? I got some unwanted messages from that number. You're getting worked up over some messages? Just check, man! It's not in my contact list. To reach our Customer Support, press the number "nine." -I need a customer's address. -Sir, may I know what your problem is? I'm getting unwanted messages from a number, and I'm annoyed about it! Sir, I'm really sorry, but we don't disclose customers' information. What should I do then? Let that person send me more messages? I understand your situation. But for us to provide the data, you need to follow the proper procedure. What is it? Please lodge a complaint with the police Requesting a legal investigation is the right course of action. Any other support... Yes, Kathir. Where are you, Meera? -I'm shopping. -Where are you shopping? At the Fashion Zone. What happened? Stay there. I'm coming. What's wrong? Go faster. Come here, Meera. -Is there a problem? -Nothing. Wait outside for a few minutes. -Tell me, Kathir. -It's nothing. Wait outside for five minutes. I'll tell you later. -Tell me now. What's wrong, Kathir? -Trust me. Wait outside for a bit. Kathir. I'll be right there. Just wait. -Who is the manager here? -I'm the manager. What is it? Where's the fitting room? Right here. What's the matter? -I'll tell you... -Sir, what is this about? Sir, tell me what's the problem. Sir, please tell me. What's the matter? Please come out. What do you want? Sir, kindly come outside. What are you looking for? Come out, sir. -What happened? -Something bad happened! -I'm asking you again. -Is there another fitting room? You've been doing weird things in the store. Who's the one doing weird things? You'll see. -Call all your staff. -Why should I do that? -Call all of them. -Why should I? I'm in charge here! Tell me. You want me to tell you? What's your problem? Are you selling clothes here or filming women? Don't make random accusations! Tell me what the issue is. You're doing your own thing here! A video has been shot in the fitting room. Do you have proof? Do you have proof? You want proof? I'll beat you to death! This is a decent place. You're acting like a fool here! What the... Decent, my foot! I'll kill you. -I have the right to sue you. -Do whatever you want! Kathir. -I'll deal with you later. -Get out. -Is there a problem? -Nothing, Meera. Let's go. -Tell me! -It's really nothing, let's go. -Kathir, my dress. -We'll buy it later. Let's go. What's the problem, Kathir? Tell me! -Return my phone, man. -Wait up. I'm expecting a call. Wait! -What a perfect catch! -Show me! Zoom in, you'll see better! That's good. That's superb, buddy. Don't forget to save it. I've done that already. I'm posting it in the group. What did you say? Show me your phone, you filthy scoundrels! Just because you have a phone, you would film anyone? -He was playing a game! -You scoundrel! Let's see. Pick up your phone. Pick up that phone. Pick it up. Open it. -Open your phone. -See, mister? I was playing a game. I didn't click any photo. I was only playing a game. -Show me that photo! -Kathir, let's leave, please. Please, Kathir. What happened to you? What a weirdo! Kathir. What's your problem, Kathir? It's nothing, Meera. Why? What's wrong? I've never seen you behave this way. It's nothing, Meera. Let's go home and talk about it later. Unless you tell me your problem, I'm not going to move from here. It's nothing, really. Believe me. You caused a scene in the store, then you beat up those boys. What's your problem? Yon won't be able to handle it, Meera. I can't handle it? Let's go home and talk about it later. Kathir! Tell me. What is the matter? Someone sent me a video of you changing clothes at the store. What? Let's leave this place. Give your phone to me. -No, Meera. Please don't... -Kathir! No, let's not do this here, Meera. We should go home. Kathir, give your phone to me. -I'll give it to you at home. -Kathir! -Meera. -Please give your phone to me. Meera. Meera. Come, let's go home. Inexpressible pain The pain which no one can bear I know that You can never bear this pain, my dear Meera! I know that You can never withstand this pain, my dear Did I think that tears can ease this pain? Did I think that the sorrow can be eased By wiping it out? Meera, say something. Your silence scares me. -Kathir. -Yes? -Will you do me a favor? -Of course, Meera. I need to be alone. -I won't leave. -Please try to understand, Kathir. No, Meera. This is nothing, Meera. I'm at the station, man. I saw your vehicle. -Come soon. Don't forget to take the book. -I know nothing about it, sir. -I am innocent, sir. -We haven't filed FIR because you called. -Don't worry. I will look into it. -The Inspector is furious. -Please spare me, sir. -I'll beat you up. Tell me the location. Spill it. -Do you know what happened yesterday? -What? -Hey, move aside. -I went to a hotel in civilian clothes. After I ate there, the hotel staff asked me to pay. Did you pay? I told him that I'm the head constable. I knew it! You never pay for food. -What is it? Come here. -Excuse me, sir. -How can I help you? -Sir... Tell me what the problem is. Sir, is there a lady cop around? Why? Can't you tell us? It's about a woman. Oh, a woman? You have a problem with your wife? No, sir. -Or there's another woman involved... -No such thing! Don't feel embarrassed. Lakshmi! -Lakshmi. -Sir? It's about a woman. He says he can only talk to you. Go on. Go and tell her. Maybe, it has something to do with the dowry. -Ma'am. -Tell me. What's the problem? I'm talking to you. What's the problem? Ma'am, actually... You see, it is... Stop beating around the bush, and get straight to the point. I've got a lot of work! They recorded a video of my girlfriend. You mean a nude video? At the fitting room, while she was changing clothes. "At the fitting room, while changing clothes"? He gets excited when it's about women. Someone recorded a video of his lover. It's your department. Look into it. Go there, son. He handles Cyber Crime. Explain it to him. -Come here. -Sir? -They filmed her with a camera? -Yes, sir. Since the launch of camera phones, there have been 50 to 60 cases like this daily! These days, false allegations are also made to settle personal scores. What you need to do is file a complaint. Did they film her while she was bathing? Okay, relax! Write it down. Write down her name, your name, and other details. Do you have evidence? -Sir... -The evidence is important. The evidence is everything! Is it outside? Okay, get it. We need it for the case. You get it? Hurry up and get that video. Make it quick! Sir, I'll start an investigation. It comes under our jurisdiction. Do you have evidence? Do you have proof? What are you guys saying? You called me many times, saying the balance of my calling account is low. Why do you charge one rupee per message? As per TRAI's rule, we charge one rupee during festivals. You said a message was worth 25 paise when I bought it. Now you're backtracking. That's why I chose this SIM. I know you don't divulge information about your customers, but I need you to do me a favor. My girlfriend is getting offensive messages from an unknown number. You come up with these new rules and continue to cheat us? I won't leave until you clear this up. Your company introduces new plans and cheats consumers like this. Please listen to me, sir. They overcharge us. If you're charging extra, at least provide a good service. Write down your phone number, I'll text you the details. -Sir, please don't tell anyone. -I won't. -Stop ringing the bell like a madman! -Who is mad here? -Call Mrithula. She sent messages... -Messages? What messages? -Mrithula! -She doesn't live here. -Call Mrithula. -Get out. -Watchman! -Call her out here! We need to talk! -Watchman! Someone is shouting here. -Call Mrithula out here! -Watchman, take him away. -Hey, Mrithula! Let go of me. -If I find her, I won't spare her! -Throw him out. -Ask her to come out, or I'll come again. -Get out. I'm not leaving without speaking to Mrithula. Ask her to come out. She died five years ago. Go! Go away. I said go away. He's already saddened by the loss of his daughter, but you kept shouting like a madman to look for her! Go away. Do you have any brain at all? You should have deleted that video and moved on. But instead you went to her and showed her the video? -Even a fool wouldn't do that. -What do you want me to do? I went to the police. They just treated me like a dog! They wanted proof. He doesn't care about the problem. He just wanted to see the video. And the network company won't help me. They can't disclose the customer ID to me. And Meera looks at me like I've gone mad. You think I wanted this? This world is full of voyeurs! You're no different. You're so confident that it will never happen to you. Are there no women in your house? You're so desperate! She has lost a lot of blood. She needs to be under observation for a week. Then she might require counseling. Have you informed her parents? No, but I will. Do it immediately. She will be transferred to her room in an hour. Meera. No need to be sorry. Stop thinking about it. Forget everything, and rest well. Meera. Give your parents' number to me. I need to inform them. No need, Kathir. They will feel bad if they hear about what happened. They need to know. If they find out that they were kept in the dark, will they not feel worse? Don't tell them. Fine. We won't tell them, okay? It has healed well. Take care. -Kathir? -Yes? Come here. -What is it? -Ask them if I can already be discharged. Kathir! Please, let's leave. Ask them if I can be discharged. Meera, it was a suicide attempt. They need to consult the psychiatrist first. I don't want to see a psychiatrist. I'm doing fine, aren't I? I won't do it again. Let's leave, Kathir. Please, Kathir. Will you marry me? Actually, I don't want to get discharged. I'd rather stay here all my life. No, Kathir. We can't allow that. She tried committing suicide. I get it, Doctor. But she said it herself. "I did a stupid thing. I won't try it again." Then it's your choice and your responsibility. -Hold on. -Yes? Don't leave her alone. Take good care of her. What happened, Kathir? What did they say? -I spoke to the doctor... -What is this? -I found it outside... -"Get well soon, Meera." Who sent this? There is no name. It's from the hospital. -So they agreed to discharge me? -They have. Are you done packing? Meera. I listened to you, didn't I? -Now, it's your turn to listen to me. -What is it? I get worried when you're alone. Until I feel assured of your safety, live with me at my place. Are you okay with that? I'll be with you as long as you want me to, Kathir. But first, let's leave. Okay. -Kathir! -Yes? You also have a red violin? My mind is like moist wind Confined in the rain When I see you, my mind goes blank I become speechless My mind is like moist wind Confined in the rain When I see you, my mind goes blank I become speechless You are the new tune Which has sprung in my life Why? Why I am getting new wings? Why do I feel like flying? The breeze carries your smell Which I seek And I get lost in it I have dedicated my life To rescue you from any adversity Who are you? I always want to be with you Who are you? I want to go somewhere far with you Why does it feel That my soul has blossomed? I can feel the music across the trees now Why does it feel That my soul has blossomed? I can feel the music across the trees now Why can you reach me? Like a brimming river I am burning in your love Like a moth in fire When I see you, my girl My heart aches When I see you, my girl I feel hurt inside You and I Should become one and enjoy life together Like the waves that touch the shore Again and again Happiness should reach us I don't know why But when I look at you, I feel intoxicated The spark of infatuation turns into a fire And becomes love I don't know why But when I look at you, I feel intoxicated The spark of infatuation turns into a fire And becomes love When I see you, my girl My heart aches And it hurts When I see you, my girl My heart aches And it hurts What's the matter? Why are you asking about her? She was a good friend of mine. I went abroad for a year and when I got back, I heard that she's not here anymore. When I went to ask about her, her dad chased me away. She was a really good person. I felt very bad, so I thought I would ask around. You know that she's a good person, but her dad failed to see that. He's crazy. That poor girl... If that girl was alive, her father would have gotten suspicious about you for just standing there. She had an older sister. He tortured her! She decided to elope with some guy. He subjected the younger sister to similar torture. One night, the girl got a call at 8:00 p.m. He smashed the phone to the ground, accusing her of speaking to a man! The girl tried to put up with him, but she couldn't. She went mad and died. If you don't know how to raise children, what's the point of all that money? You expect me to do all the work? You won't do your job? You bastard! It's Monday tomorrow. -Everyone will yell at me. -Thank you. Sprinkle some water and iron those clothes. -Hello? -It's me, buddy. I'm near the girl's house. I can't hear you. Hold on. Hello, Kathir? Can you hear me now? Yes, Meera was sitting next to me. It's DJ! Tell me. I asked a laundryman from that area. They say the girl was innocent, and her dad was the psycho. I can't make sense of it. It was confusing. -Where are you now? -Right next to the girl's house. -Her dad was angry. -Wait for me there. I'm coming. No, I'm going to the bar. See you there. Okay, no problem. I'll see you in the morning. What is it, Kathir? It's nothing. It was DJ. I'll see him in the morning. It's nothing! Meera, take an auto-rickshaw. I'll meet DJ and pick you up. Okay? The following information was received by the police, the Narcotics Bureau... Kathir, come here. ...the police have conducted raids in several other hotels in the city. We got information that drug peddling takes place at this bar. We've arrested some people during the raid. The investigation is ongoing. Action will be taken against those found guilty. It looks like they have contacts with drug peddlers who were arrested by the police, near the local college. Wait. I'll also come with you. You wait here. I'll be back. Kathir? The court insists on strict implementation of the law. -Who is your supplier? -Sir... -I don't know. -Give his phone number to me. -You don't know? -Sir... -I'll beat you up! -I don't know, sir. -Give his phone number. -I really don't know anyone. Give your phone to me. -Hand over your phone. -Sir... What's that? What is it? Sir, my friend got arrested. Arrested? Which friend? Arrested at the bar last night. The ones from the bar? You won't see them here. Meet them at the court. The lawyer, Mr. Kesavan told me... He always meddles with other people's business. Do you see that person sitting over there? Go to him. If you don't tell us who your supplier is, you will be beaten to death. Sir, handle them carefully. They smuggled weed from Bodi. Mr. Kesavan sent me here. -What is it about? -My friend, DJ, got arrested. Who are you? My name is Kathir. I'm his friend. His friend or his partner? Just his friend. You only get five minutes. Mani. Kathir! What happened? I don't know. Check the pockets of any guy at the bar, and you'd find a handful of drugs. Everyone knows that. Even the cops know it. They received a video from an anonymous sender. -A video? -Yes. They had to do something before it could be leaked to the media. Shall I talk to your boss? It seems that they have engaged an advocate. Since I was caught on video, they had no choice but to arrest me. I can't get bail for six months. I'm scared, man. -That won't happen. Don't be scared. -Man... Why are you scared? You know what is the punishment for this in Malaysia? Death by hanging! But here, it's just jail time and then bail! Don't be scared. Let it go. -Shut up, man. -Come, sit here. Kathir, take care. You too. I'll see you. What happened, Kathir? Why did he get arrested? They got a video of him using drugs at the bar from an anonymous sender. A video? Who sent that? I don't know. But I'm a little scared. Let's stay somewhere else for a while. What are you saying, Kathir? Where will we go? I don't know, Meera. I hid something from you. The reason Vinod died was because of a similar video. Then I received your video. Now it's DJ. I feel scared, Meera. Let's leave town for a while, please. -Where will we go, Kathir? -I don't know. But I don't think it's safe here. Pack things up. I'll stop by at the office and be home in half an hour. Meera, where are you? Why didn't you answer my call? -What is wrong, Kathir? -Check if there's someone in the bedroom. -Why are you panicking? Tell me... -Just go and check! There is no one here. -Then check the bathroom. -Why? There's no one here. Don't scare me. Tell me what this is about. The balcony, too. There is nobody here. What's the matter? Don't open the door until I get there. Don't open the door, I will be there in ten minutes. Please listen to me! If you don't want the video to be uploaded online, you should listen to me. Don't act smart by trying to call me. You'll find instructions in the dustbin at the corner of that parking lot. Remove all your clothes and wear only this raincoat. You should stand at the bridge for ten minutes while wearing this raincoat. Even if the world comes to an end, you must not leave the bridge. Who is this guy? Why is he just standing there? Disgusting! Get out of the way. There are women here who can see you. Go away. Who is this madman? -Are you out of your mind? -Don't stand there, you shameless man. This is disgusting. Not in front of the kids, brainless oaf. Kathir, do you know now how it feels to stand naked in front of the public? After a year of training and eight years in service, I am left with cases like this to handle. Stupid fellow. Are you crazy? And you say this was a bet! You should be behind bars for causing a public nuisance. But that would also be a waste of court's precious time. Complete the formalities and send him away. If I ever see you again, I won't spare you. Get out. Check if everything is in order. Sign here. You may leave. -Meera? -Kathir. Where are you? Why didn't you answer my calls? I'm outside. Where are you? -I'm at home. Where-- -Stay there. I'll be there in a moment. Where were you, Kathir? It's so late. I packed our things and waited for you. Tell me what's wrong. I called you so many times. Sorry, Meera. I was working. Working? You told me you were going to see DJ. I had some work with my album, and it got late. You told me you would be here in half an hour. I've been waiting. Stop, Kathir. I'm talking to you. I told you. I'm late because of a meeting. Have you eaten? Come, let's eat. Don't change the subject. You're hiding something. Why did you ask me to search all over the apartment? Why did you ask me to look around? Look at me when I'm talking to you. Kathir! -Kathir, look at-- -What do you want me to say? Take a good look at this face. I told you that I was working! What should I say? Should I tell you all the details, like where I go and whom I meet? I'm being patient, but you're taking advantage of it. Don't you know your limits? Try to understand! Serve the food. Meera. Meera? Meera! Meera! Meera, open the door. Meera? Meera! Meera! Meera. Meera, are you okay? Who the hell are you? Why did you do this? Give your phone to me. I'll kill you. The phone! Give it to me! I always found that guy shady. He would always be at the balcony and look at everyone's windows. Remember that I told you about the guy who leered at me? It was him! He used to drive around at night. I've seen him! Come on. I've been telling you. Someone had been looking through our windows. You didn't believe me. Do you realize it now? We ask people not to rent out their houses to people like these, but to no avail. Move. -You take him to the station. -Okay, sir. -I'll finish up the inquiry here. -Yes, sir. Don't worry, Meera. It's all over. He will be punished for the crime. Why are you upset? I spoke to the police. The inspector told me that he would destroy the phone. Please forget about it. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left you alone. He has been caught. Caught and handed over to the police. Forget it. Do you want to eat something? Shall I make you some coffee? Be gentle Put me down like a flower To wake me from my unconsciousness Sprinkle me with your kisses like water I feel like flying Take me with you Higher and higher Oh, girl, my dear girl This love is not blind Oh, girl, my dear girl This love knows no boundary Oh, girl, my dear girl On the canvas of this night You and I Are painting our love Be soft Put me down like a flower To wake me from my unconsciousness Sprinkle me with your kisses like water I feel like flying, take me with you Higher and higher Slowly I let you inside my heart And you ended up here I let you envelop me Like water-laden clothes I let you burn me Let us burn in this fire Whether it's night or day Let us be enlightened by love Not a thing Could come between us We have come back From the clutches of passion The craters on the moon Were dug by your nails Let us ride the clouds And love each other, my dear Meera! Meera. Mrithula and I were classmates. She was my best friend. MUSIC COLLEGE - KOVAI A FEW YEARS BACK We studied together at the music college. I grew up in an orphanage. Mrithula taught me the meaning of love. She was a beautiful angel. Wherever we went to the college, there would be a crowd looking at her. But she didn't fall for anyone. She was an angel without wings. We are the musical birds With no boundaries Among the creations of God We are the definition of beauty We are the birds who try to fly high We are cute angels We had a music competition in our college. There were students from other colleges who came to participate in it. That's where I first saw him. Our next performer is Kathir from Chennai Music College. How long will you take to play it? Why did he blow you a kiss? He created a storm in my heart when I saw him looking at me. Talk to him. Let's go. -During class hours? -Yes. Life would be more fun if we only had to attend these events! It looks like the guitar is tuned in this direction. Shut up. -Shall we play a game? -What? A game? He just got on stage and mimicked a sheep, and he got loud applause. The guy who rapped a song no one understood was worse. He also got loud applause! -You should have heard the whistles. -You're just jealous! When I went on stage, I sang using my entire vocal range, but no one applauded. -Hold on. -What is it? Ignore him. Listen to the story. The guy from the other music college played without reading notes. That's difficult. He's looking. Don't! -I think he's looking at you. -Kathir! Will you shut up? Are you looking for someone? He sensed it. I thought he would come over and talk to you, but he didn't. Even if he doesn't want to, it looks like you'll make him talk to me! We need closure, right? Closure? Come on. I was scared that he might come and stand in front of me! You're just saying that now. But when he proposes to you, you would reply, "I love you too. You're my sweetheart." What was that? Say it again. -No way! -Please, Mitthu. -What? -Please! -Please, Mitthu. Do it once more! -Okay, fine. Why are you filming all this? I'm feeling shy. Go away! Mitthu? Mitthu, it's your dad. -Who? -Your dad's calling. Hello, Dad? No, Dad. I was in my room. I say my prayers. I am studying. No such thing, Dad. Yes. Okay, Dad. Okay, Dad. What's wrong, Mitthu? Just the usual questions! "Who were you talking to? What were you talking about? Did you pray? Are you going to elope with some guy like your sister?" I'm used to it. -The one in the yellow dress? -Not her. -Look, it's your guy. -Shut up, girl! -She was hot! -Did you even see her performance? -What about the Christian College boys? -They're performing this evening. I'm a bit nervous about that. They're not a competition! You're the champion. Don't worry! Hey, man. One of those girls left her phone here. Oh, man. They share the best adult jokes! -Let's just leave. -Wait, I'll get it. You'll surely mess up. Hold on. You're the right man for this job. Get the phone. I'll slap you. Let's go. Then keep watch. Let me get it. I'm not your lookout. Keep watch. I'll get it. Come on. Hurry! -Oh, man! -Goodness. -Who is this girl? -She's quite something! -Share it! -Stop! It's really hot! If you don't want it, fine. But at least let us share it. Whatever it is, make it quick! He's coming to see you. I left my phone in the classroom. -Come with me. -Let's go. -I got it! -Here. Share it with me. Turn your Bluetooth on. Hey, that's my phone. I'm sharing it now. Check if you got it. I told you. He has realized that you're into him. He must have taken it to get your number. -He'll surely call you! -Let's see. That's really hot, dude. Kathir, check this out. Why are you staring at your phone? You're expecting his call? No way! Nothing like that. He's smarter than you. He won't call until he reaches home. Oh, God! I'd be happy if he doesn't call. Sure, I believe you! But the truth is, I was waiting for his call. Why are you filming all this? I'm feeling shy. Go! It's great that you can go straight home after the exams. Take her to your hostel room, man. Why is everyone looking at us like that? -Is my makeup smudged? -No. I don't know who she was with. The college beauty, the video queen is here! So, Mrithula, when is the next release? -Why are they looking at us like that? -They are idiots. Don't mind them. Hey, man. She's here! -Why are you filming this? I'm shy. Go!" -Shiva, keep quiet. Give me five! Who is Mrithula? -It's me. -The principal wants to see you. She is in big trouble. Are you Mrithula? Only Mrithula can come. Mom, what are you doing here? -What have you done? -Mom? Go inside. This couldn't be discussed over the phone. That's why I asked you to come in person. You know that this is a prestigious educational institution. Think about it from our perspective. We don't want our name to be tarnished. In this college, conduct is more important than education. After what happened, it won't be good if your daughter stays here. I can help you. We will let her take the final exam tomorrow, then she can drop out. That's the best we can do. -What did I do? Why should I-- -Mrithula! Why are you filming all this? I'm feeling shy. Go! You wretch! Dad! What happened, dear? -Dad, please listen to me. -What happened? -Won't you tell me what happened? -Let me explain. What do you want me to say? -She recorded a video with a guy. -Dad, please listen. -I'm ashamed to even say it. -Dad! It's not what you think. It wasn't a guy. Not a boy? Was it a girl then? You shameless girl. Listen to me carefully. Consider our daughter dead. -She has disgraced our family. -What's happening? -Stop it. -Let go of me. Go somewhere and die. Listen to me. She wouldn't have done that. Mitthu. Mitthu, what happened? Tell me. What happened? I told you not to record that video, Meera. It was all my fault. It was not your fault, Meera. Did you notice? Those who saw the video and those who spread it around, they suddenly all turned into saints. But the one in the video, which is me, became a whore. Even my dad asked me to die. Why are you saying this, Mitthu? Just one more day. Then let's leave this evil place and go somewhere far away. We'll go to some place where no one knows us. Let's go, Meera. Let's go. Meera. Can you do me a favor? Sure, Mitthu. Can you sleep in the other room just for tonight? I can't leave you alone. I won't do anything that would worry you. I will stay here. I'll be with you. I need to be alone just for today. Meera. I need to be alone just for today. I don't know when I fell asleep. I just wished that the night hadn't ended. Mitthu! Mitthu! Mitthu, open the door. I'm scared, Mitthu. Please open the door. Mitthu. I'm still alive, Meera. Mitthu. Please listen to me. Once the exam is over, let's go somewhere. Please open the door. Go ahead. I'll join you. Listen to me. Go ahead, Meera. Wait in the classroom. I'll be there. Please open the door. Hey, that's my phone. Beautiful. Angel! The whole town calls you a whore. Mitthu. Mitthu! Meera! Meera. Meera, don't do anything rash. Meera, listen to me. Please come down. Meera. Meera! Meera. You need to know the pain of losing someone you love. Meera, please don't make a rash decision. Meera, I'm coming. Please! Meera, listen to me. Please! Meera, don't... For my sake, don't do it. Meera! Meera. Meera! Please, Meera. Come here, Kathir. I want to see you. Meera, I'm coming there. Don't do anything rash! Meera! Meera, what did I do? They are the ones who did it. I didn't do anything, Meera. -Meera, please... -You should have done something. You should have stopped them. You were there. I was there. But I didn't do anything. When it happens to someone you care about, you panic. But when it happened to a stranger, you didn't do anything. It wasn't like that. Listen to me. Don't come near me, Kathir. Okay! I'm not coming near you. Come here, Meera. Punish me however you want, Meera. What I did was wrong. Meera, please... We don't understand the pain of something until it happens to us. Oh, god. I don't know how to explain it to you, Meera. I need you, Meera. I really like you, Kathir. -I want to live with you. -Meera. But you and I have caused the death of an angel. I can't live with the guilt. Meera! Meera! Meera... We don't understand the pain of something until it happens to us. Meera!
