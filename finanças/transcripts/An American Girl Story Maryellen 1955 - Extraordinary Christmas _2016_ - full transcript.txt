♪♪ ["Jingle Bells"] Mrs. Larkin: Maryellen? Maryellen. Maryellen Larkin! Maryellen, I've been looking everywhere for you. Sorry, Mom. You know how I feel about snow. Come on out of there. We got to go pick up-- What are you wearing? [chuckle] Ellie. Are those pants? Aren't they neat? Found them in the boys' department. - Where is your skirt? - [bike bell rings] Look what we found. Mm-mm. Nope. No, no. Can we get these? And this sweater. I don't have a blue cashmere one. Caroline, you made your Christmas list already. We're here to look for Dad. Beverly, no. - But, Mom-- - But, Mom-- Caroline, put it away. And where is Joan? Joan's in the book section. [scoff] And where was your head, Ellie? My head was thinking about how you used to have snow when you were our age. And pants would keep my legs warm. You have a whole stack of wonderful clothes from Caroline waiting for you on your bed at home. Hand-me-downs. Girl clothes. Maybe you heard. Girls don't wear pants in public. - Why not? - Why not? - You're so embarrassing. - Okay. Beverly, Tom, toys back where you found them. Caroline, find Joe and meet us at the car. Ellie, skirt. Everyone, march. ♪ Haka wuka wei ♪ ♪Haka wu-- ♪ Okay. Fine. No more messing with public property. And pants are for home and play only. Not school, not shopping, not company. Those are-- The rules. I know. One never says "Why?" You just say "Do it." I know. Terrible mother. [chuckle] If you keep making that face, you could get stuck with that. All right, let's go. Dad and I have to go pick up my friend Connie and her son Benjy at the bus station. Let's get out of here before they throw us out. Maryellen, can you roll up the window? I'm baking, it's so hot. December heat wave. Is there snow where Connie and Benjy come from? They live in Georgia. Grandmom and Grandpop live in Georgia, and they see snow every winter. They live in the mountains. Why is Benjy staying with us if he has polio? He recovered, just like Maryellen did. Remember, she slept alone in the den for a few months. Benjy's better, too, but he's got some extra problems with one of his legs. - He's a cripple? - Beverly. She doesn't know. We don't use that word. And you can barely tell Maryellen had polio anyways. Doctors here have a special operation called fusion that they can do on his feet. Benjy and his mom are staying with us while he has it. Why can't they live in a hotel? They couldn't afford a hotel and the operation, so we're helping out. But no one say anything. Why not? It's not polite. So he gets a new leg for Christmas? In a way. He gets a second chance. At being like everyone else. Hmm. There they are. Hey, Dad. I saw a Davy Crockett hat. So just because I had polio, I'm not like everyone else? Oh, sweetie, you were never like everyone else, not from the moment you were born. - [chuckle] - [chuckle] Beverly: There's pink everywhere. A pink bike, a pink crown. I wanted a cashmere sweater, a blue one. I put on my list for Santa tutu and a baby doll. Wow. Sounds like quite the trip, huh? What about you, Ellie? Maryellen wants pants, boy pants. And I want to see snow. Extraordinary. Daddy, can I help? If you ask one good question. Uh, what's the biggest number? Ah. Ha ha. - Thanks. - Caroline? Infinity? You win the $64,000 prize. Beverly. I'm hot. Can we go to the beach? - Huh. Good question. - Dad! Bathing suits are drying out back. I can get them suited up, then I have a date with Jerry. - Come on, gang. - Thanks, Joanie. Joan. [sigh] How many grains of sand are there on the earth? No one solved that one yet. Then I win. Okay. I'm heading out. Can I come? Sorry, chicken. I need you to take the brownies out of the oven in a half hour. Caroline can do it. And straighten up this mess. Didn't I just pick up in here? Sorry, Mom. You okay, kiddo? Could I visit Grandmom and Grandpop for Christmas as my present? All the snow and real pine trees they talk about from when you were little. Maybe I could see that, too. You said Grandpop's shoulder wasn't doing very well and they might not make it to visit this year. And maybe you could have some time all by yourself with Grandmom and Grandpop? Hey. This is a private conversation. It's my room, too. I thought you went to the beach. I need my sunglasses. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. Look, Dad and I have to go. Okay? We'll be back with Connie and Benjy in 45 minutes. We can talk about this later. You sure you don't want to head out with the others? Hm-mm. All right. Well, Joanie's here getting ready for her date. Don't forget about the brownies, and make this place look extra special for when we get home, okay? Mm-hmm. [laughing] That's cool. Thanks. I thought my mom would like it. She's always doing hard stuff. You mean like taking care of you? Hey. [giggling] You should save it as a Christmas present. It's good. Nobody wants my drawing as a present. What's on your list? Oh, a Dick Tracy watch, marbles, a new bat, and blue flippers. All my friends are getting blue ones. How come everybody likes to do the same things all the time? I don't know. People like doing what their friends do, I guess. But doesn't that make things kind of ordinary? What if I want to be extraordinary? Not extra ordinary. It's like every house on our block is the same. And the next block over, too. Mom said she wanted our house to be special for our guests, but-- Oh, I know that look. What are you doing? Bike to school tomorrow? Sure thing. ♪♪ [jazzy intro] ♪ Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer ♪ ♪ Had a very shiny nose ♪ ♪And if you ever saw it ♪ ♪You would even say it glows ♪ ♪All of the other reindeer ♪ ♪ Used to laugh and call him names ♪ ♪They never let poor Rudolph ♪ ♪ Join in any reindeer games ♪ Extraordinary. ♪ Then one foggy Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Santa came to say ♪ ♪"Rudolph with your nose so bright ♪ ♪ Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?" ♪ What are you doing? Did Mom say you could do that? It's a surprise. She'll be surprised, all right. And you're too short to reach the top. I know what I'm doing. Why'd you come back anyway? We forgot the sand toys. Is something burning? Oh, the brownies. Fireman to the rescue! Can you get them? I'm in the middle of painting. - Mom told you. - But they're burning. - I'll save the day. - No, no, no, no! Tommy, stop! Tommy! No! [gasp] Jerry! What in the world? Maryellen forgotted the brownies. - Uh-- - Oh, my God. Joan, uh, could you show Connie and Benjy to Tom's room? Sure thing. Caroline, could you wash up and take the kids to the beach and let them play until dinner? All of the kids? All of them. Except Maryellen. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Clothespins. [sigh] I love you, Ellie, and I love your big heart. And I know, in a family this size, it can be hard to get attention. But you can't keep crawling into window displays wearing clothes you're not supposed to. There's nothing wrong with pants. And painting doors to stand out. I wanted to make our house stand out, not me. Maybe me a little, but what's wrong with that? I guess I'd ask why you want to bring attention to yourself so much. Nobody listens to me in this family unless I do. That's not true. Caroline's good at piano. Beverly's a great dancer. Joan's super smart and has read every book in the library. Tom can play drums. And what do I do? I want to feel extraordinary, too. And you thought a red door was extraordinary. Well, isn't it? Look. Painting doors will get you noticed, okay? But wouldn't it be great to be noticed for something meaningful? Like what? Like... Like Dr. Jonas Salk, who invented the polio vaccine. He decided it was so important everyone have the vaccine, he didn't even patent it. That means he gave up a lot of money so everyone could be healthy. Do you think Dr. Salk stands out? I think he's a hero. Sometimes, when you focus on other people, you can do amazing things. Maybe I should focus on Connie and Benjy. That's a great place to start. Why can't they afford a hotel? Connie's husband Dan was a sergeant in the army, and he died during a training mission when Benjy was very little. Now Connie has to support both of them, which is hard. How did you two meet? Connie worked on the assembly line I supervised at the factory during World War II. You were in charge of the factory? Mm-hmm. We built airplanes. - You built airplanes? - Mm-hmm. - Mom. - [chuckle] Why aren't you doing it anymore? Well, the women were let go. When the men came back, they took their jobs. They took them? Why? It's just the way things are. Did you like your job? Couldn't you fight back? I loved the job, but I wasn't given the choice. I don't understand. So women don't make airplanes anymore. Women have lots of opportunities. They can be teachers and nurses and secretaries. A woman I went to high school with writes for a newspaper in New York City. Only one? I bet there are others now. What else? They can be moms. [chuckle] That's not a job. Hey. it's not like being in an office or a factory. Being a mom is a very big job and one I love, too. But Dad has a job, and he's still a dad. Mm-hmm. Why can't moms have jobs and still be moms? Maybe in the future they will. I'm really sorry about before. I know. I just want you to think first, Ellie, before you go headlong into things. I'll try. You really want to go to Grandmom and Grandpop's for Christmas by yourself? Maybe it would be nice to have them all to myself like you did when you were growing up and see real snow instead of the spray-on kind. Hmm. No promises, but I'll talk to Dad. You will? Oh, Mom, you're the best! Hey. Let's make sure you got all that paint off. Come here. Thinking about others first. - That's what moms do. - Mm-hmm. That's what the best people do. - Finish this laundry. - [chuckle] [snoring] Hi, Benjy. I have trouble sleeping. I share a room with three sisters. You'd think girls are quiet sleepers, but Caroline-- [imitates snoring] [giggling] Do you like being an only kid? It's quiet, but it can be lonely. You always have someone around. Yeah. And my mom calls me every one of their names first. Jo-Bev-Care-Maryellen! You have a good laugh. I collect jokes. Collect them? I have a notebook where I write down all my favorites. My mom gave me a new joke book to take to the hospital, and I wasn't supposed to read it before I got there, but I couldn't sleep. Tell me one. Okay. Knock-knock. - Who's there? - Radio. Radio who? Radio not, here I come. [giggling] Okay, knock-knock. Who's there? Dwayne. Dwayne who? Dwayne the bathtub. [both] I'm dwowning. [laughing] Shh. Are you nervous about the operation? Sorry. I know I'm not supposed to say anything. It's okay. People mostly avoid me or say mean things behind my back. The doctors where I live tried to retrain my muscles, but that didn't work, so the operation's the only way I might walk without a brace. Maybe then people will stop saying stuff about me. I had polio, too. I mean, it wasn't-- You don't have a limp or anything. One of my legs is smaller than the other. It's not the same, but-- Did you have to stay away from other kids when you had it? Even my brother and sisters. That's when I learned how to draw. That's when I started reading joke books. I guess I'm not so worried about the operation. It's just Christmas at home, my mom did all these traditions. And-- Plus, this year, we won't be getting many presents - because-- - What would you choose If you could have anything? I guess a chance to come back when my leg's ready for rehab. But we can't pay for the doctors and another trip. That's not the kind of present Santa brings anyway. Even if he could find me here, does this hospital even have a chimney? [car approaches] Can't wait to tell everyone. Shh. Let's keep it quiet. Hey. What's all this? Jerry: Nice work, M-E. And, Benjy, what are you doing up so late? Let's get you inside. Got a big day tomorrow. There you go, bud. Good job, Ellie. Thanks. Good night, Benjy. Good night, Ellie. Good night. Whoa there, champ. I think I got enough red on me for one day, huh? Sorry about before. I'm only teasing. My shorts were a big hit at the club. Maybe I'll invite some of my friends over. You can paint them, too. My dad has some green paint in the garage. We can make it a Christmas theme. Now you're talking. What were you guys talking about before? When you drove up, you were going to tell everyone-- Uh, no, I-- I can't be the one to tell. Come on. You looked like you really wanted to tell somebody. I can keep a secret. Please. I gave Joan my fraternity pin. Really? You two got pinned? Maryellen, shh. You can't tell anyone, seriously. All right? She'll be furious with me, okay? She wants to tell everyone on her own time. You won't tell? I won't tell. Pinky swear. Pinky swear. Hey. Is this your art book? Mm-hmm. - Mind if I take a look? - No. Wow. I didn't know you drew. You're an artist. What? No. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Wow. You have talent, M-E. Keep up the good work. Good night. So you'll spend Christmas away? Yeah. I'll miss everybody, but won't it be amazing to see real snow and go ice skating and be by myself with my grandparents for the first time? Sure. That would be cool. Plus, Benjy and Connie are staying with us, so no one will miss me. You know that's not true. So Benjy has to spend Christmas in the hospital? I'm going to go visit him after school today, - if you want to come. - Yeah. I bet we could get the class to make cards to bring. Sure. Let's ask Mr. So. Wait. Is that red paint on your neck? It's a long story. I might give my mom this perfume. It comes all the way from France. Sounds expensive. Maybe I'll make her some bookends. We're making birdhouses in wood shop. I'm getting pretty good. What are you doing in home ec? Ironing. I think I'm getting a D. It's this way. 40, 41, 40... Here we go. Should we even be here? Excuse me, sir. I'm friends with Benjamin Rowe. Is that his room? He's in pre-op tests right now. Can I ask-- did all those kids have polio? I'm not allowed to share that information. But will they all be here for Christmas? Mm-hmm. Well, do you do anything special for them, like a tree? No, we don't. Well, since you don't, I'd like to do something. I mean, we would. Right, Davey? Trees could bring in allergens, which might make it more difficult for them to breathe. But presents would be okay, right? I could buy them presents. You could? How old are you, 9? I'm 10. Well, I'm sorry, but it's against the rules, and I have a meeting. But I-- I bet we could do something great, like a party, boat load of presents. Let's tell Benjy. Or we could make it a surprise. Right? Davey. Uh, my mom needs me back by 5. I-- I just remembered. C-Can we go? Ah. There she is. Here. Someone wants to say hi. Be quick. It's almost three minutes. Hello. Hi, Grandmom! How's Georgia? I miss you, too. Is it snowing yet? Oh. Maybe soon, though, right? How's Grandpop's shoulder? Mom, have you asked them yet? You pest. School's good. Davey and I went to go see our friend Benjy at the hospital today. We brought him cards we made in class. Hey. Yeah, I'll tell him. Will you tell Grandpop I love him and I'll send him another letter soon? Okay. I love you, too. Bye. She said call again tomorrow. - Help with the salad? - Mm-hmm. That was thoughtful what you and Davey did. How was the hospital? There were kids in a big room with him, some worse than Benjy. One couldn't even move at all. I guess I was really lucky, huh? I think that's why people were so happy Dr. Salk developed his vaccine. Everyone's luckier now. Those kids are spending Christmas in a hospital. I want to do something for them. I just have to think of a way to raise enough money to buy presents. Well, you can make presents. Kids don't like homemade presents. I want to throw a big party. Is that what they want? Who wouldn't want a big party? I saw you cleaned up outside. That was a nice surprise to wake up to. You were thinking about others, huh? Mm-hmm. Is this like that? I want it to be, but how do you know what the best thing is? You know what helps me? Listening. Not talking or doing, just paying attention. Sometimes, when you listen very closely, you can find out what means the most to people. Think about them, not just me. You know that conversation I just had with Grandmom? Mm-hmm. Your father and I talked it over, and we agree. You can go to Georgia for your Christmas present. We'll put you on the overnight train on the 23rd, and you can spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with them. Oh, thank you! Oh, thank you so much! Ee! - You should be boss again. - Hmm. You're good at being in charge. I'm in charge of exactly what I want to be. Here. You can use this to take to the train station and pay for your own ticket to Georgia. Put it in a safe place. I will. Thanks, Mom. Sure. Mom, Dad just got home. Do you need help with dinner? Oh, dear, yes. I'd better get a move on. It's almost 6. Start with the carrots, okay? And that's when my engineering student asked what must have been his twelfth question. Do your students have to ask questions to get things, too? How come you like questions so much? How else are you going to learn things? You can learn by reading books like Joan. I like books a lot, but maybe Dad means the more questions you ask, the more quickly you'll get to the heart of what you want to know. See? Joanie gets it. She asked lots of questions. She could be an engineer. Joan? But she's a girl. You know what? I have a girl in my class, and she does better than most of the boys. More girls are going to college every year. No reason Joanie couldn't, or you. Now, here's my biggest question. Who's going to pass me those potatoes? [laughter] - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. ♪ ...come ♪ ♪Let earth receive... ♪ Hello, there. Shew. I just have to sit and catch my breath. Why, sure. I brought my grandchildren down to see Santa-- Oh, good. A carnival? That's a lot of work. If it snowed here, I could clear people's driveways for money. Go to sleep, Ellie. Too bad it doesn't snow here. Come on. Uhh. One more question? Read a book. It'll relax you so you can go to sleep. Books relax you. You love books. You'd marry them if you could. [giggling] Speaking of getting married, Jerry told me about you guys. Shh! Maryellen. Please don't be mad. He was so happy, like he was going to burst if he didn't tell. He really likes you. So pinned leads to engaged, which leads to married. Doesn't it? Do you think he'll propose? Maybe. Maybe he'll propose at Christmas. You could be married this summer. Whoa. Slow down. He just gave me his pin. Lots of girls get married right after high school. If you love him-- I do. Does he likes books and stuff as much as you do? [chuckle] It's late. Come on. Don't tell anybody, okay? I want to keep it my secret a little longer. I'll keep yours if you keep mine. What secret? I'm going to Grandmom and Grandpop's to see snow for Christmas. Promise you won't tell? I don't want all the kids trying to come with me. I promise. I got it. A talent show. Talent show? Mm-hmm. We get all of our friends together, and everybody does what they do best. You can do yo-yo tricks. I can sing. You're not that great a singer. Sure I am. We'll have some dancers, violin player, and I can emcee. We can do it as a celebration for the kids and raise money to buy presents all at the same time. But the hospital guy said no. It's Christmas. How could he be against presents? There are rules, and he said-- Not the rules again. We don't know anything about it. Those kids were really sick. Do you not want to do it? Davey. You don't think those kids are-- well, you don't think they're weird? Weird? They were sick, and they're trying to get better. What if they don't? Well, then they'll need help and people who are nice to them. Don't you want to be nice to them? - They make me feel-- - What? I don't know. What about me? I had polio, too. - You're different. - Why? Because I got better faster? Davey, that could be me. Don't be so dense. You're the one being dense. Why? Because I don't want to hang out with a bunch of cripples? Davey! Why are you being so mean? I'm not. My mom says you have to think about others and their feelings first. You can't call them-- I didn't say it to anybody's face. Besides, everyone calls them that. Benjy's just a kid whose dad died in the Korean war, and he's getting an operation right at Christmas, and you don't even want to help. You know, unless maybe it's just an excuse for you to sing and emcee and show how great and special you are. You do things to get attention. I mean, the red door, a big celebration. I mean, come on. Is that what you think? Why don't you just say you don't want to do it because you're a coward? Davey-- Good work thinking about other people's feelings. Davey, come on. I didn't mean it. Maryellen: It's going to be great. And we have so much talent right here. Caroline can play the piano, Beverly can dance, Tom can play drums, and I'll sing. You don't sing so good. I sing fine. I'll emcee. I can emcee. I'm emceeing. And we'll charge admission. I'll do all your chores for a week. A month. [sigh] Come on. Why don't we take a break? Talk about it after dinner. Christmas is only a week away. If we want to do this together-- You don't want to do things together. You want to go off by yourself. I never said that. You're going off to Grandmom's and Grandpop's by yourself, have your big old snowy Christmas. What? Joan, you told? No. Told what? Look, Mom and Dad said I could go. I won't be here on Christmas, so on the 22nd we can do the talent show and still have time to buy presents. Joan. You could read them stories. I can't do it that day. Why? Because you have to be with your fiancé? Fiancé? Did Jerry propose? I didn't-- It slipped out. [singsong] Joanie's getting married! Joanie's getting married! Maryellen: You guys, stop it. - She just got pinned. - Joanie's getting married! She and Jerry are pinned. Joan? Is that true? [sigh] I wanted to tell everyone at Christmas, but yes, Jerry gave me his pin. Ohh. Thanks a lot, Maryellen. Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you. Maryellen: I'm sorry. I was just-- Forget I said anything... ever. Does it hurt? Nah. It's just really uncomfortable. Do you want me to read you some jokes? I know them by heart now. What's it like where you live? Small. There's only one elementary school and one police station for the whole town. Why do you live there? Because it's where my dad was from. Do you remember him? A little. My mom shows me pictures and tells me stories about him. It must be rough not having a dad. He was really great. And if he was around, maybe I'd have a brother or sister or a brother and three sisters like you. But I'll be better soon. And even if I don't come back for the rehab, I'm lucky. Not everybody can say that. Okay. Hey, that looks like me. You're a really good drawer. I just like how you look when you're laughing. Nobody ever thinks of me laughing. You're the only one who saw that. Visiting hours are over. Okay. Bye, Benjy. Bye. [chatter] Young lady, what you did back there was very thoughtful. Your drawing, uh... Oh. Was nothing. Not to Benjy. You know why hospitals have rules about what we can and can't do? These-- These kids fight so hard, and we have to protect them. Sure. But maybe sometimes we forget the people behind the rules, and your drawing... reminded me who they are inside, like a good artist does. You think I'm an artist? Don't you? Do you want the drawing? No. No. That's-- That's a present for Benjy. It's a gift. ♪♪ [song intro, sleighbells] ♪ Up on the housetop, reindeer pause ♪ ♪Out jumps good old Santa Claus ♪ ♪Down through the chimney with lots of toys ♪ ♪All for the little ones' Christmas joys ♪ - Chorus: ♪Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ - ♪ Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪Up on the housetop, click, click, click ♪ ♪Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick ♪ ♪First comes the stocking of little Nell ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Santa, fill it well ♪ ♪Give her a dolly that laughs and cries ♪ ♪One that can open and shut its eyes ♪ - ♪Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ - ♪ Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪Up on the housetop, click, click, click ♪ ♪Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick ♪ ♪Look in the stocking of little Bill ♪ ♪ Oh, just see, what a glorious fill ♪ ♪Here's a hammer and lots of tacks ♪ ♪ A whistle, a ball, and a whip that cracks ♪ - ♪Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ - ♪ Ho-ho-ho ♪ - ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ Hey, what are you doing in here?

They're amazing. The things the children are doing-- They all said what they would do when they were better and out of the hospital, so that's what I drew. Look at these. And I thought you didn't like homemade presents. Well, a big celebration isn't what they wanted. I talked to them. No. I listened, like you said. Wait till you tell Grandmom and Grandpop what you did. Oh. I'm not going to Georgia. What? Nobody wanted to do that talent show, and Benjy really wants to come back to the hospital here to do his rehab, but he and his mom can't afford to come back and pay for doctors, so I returned my ticket. I'm giving them my money for the bus fare instead of going to Georgia. Oh, Ellie, what about being an only child for a few days, seeing snow? I decided to pay attention to other people. If Benjy comes back, he can be all healed like me. Do you think Grandmom and Grandpop will understand? I think they'll be so proud. Mom, have you seen my red dress? No! Don't look. Wow. Did you do those, Ellie? Don't tell anybody they're here. Don't look. I'm going to go to the beach to finish up in private. Bye. She drew all the children at the hospital and traded in her ticket to Georgia to help Benjy. [knock on door] [door opens] Davey: Maryellen? Maryellen. Davey. Sorry. You just missed Maryellen. Oh. Well, will you tell her I came? Sure. What are those? Oh. Uh, Maryellen and I had a fight. She left me an early Christmas present. Would you tell her I'm sorry? Of course. Hey, Davey, you're good at woodworking, aren't you? Mm, pretty good. Why? I think I have an idea how you might make it up with Maryellen. You look pretty. Thanks. Last date before Christmas. Hey, Maryellen. I know you're mad. I'm sorry. You're pretty incredible. Mom told me about you giving up your trip. And making those drawings-- How did you even know what to draw? Sometimes, if you listen very closely, you can hear what means the most to people. [chuckle] Mom said that. Well, I don't think I could have done what you did. You're so smart, you could do anything. Want to know a secret? Hmm. Remember when you said that I could be married by the end of the summer? Mm-hmm. [sigh] Made me realize why I didn't want everyone knowing that Jerry and I got pinned. I love him so much, and I do want to spend my life with him, but I'm scared it means that I can't do other things like learn everything I want to learn, travel, or even go to college, like Dad said. Maybe even get a job. You want to do all that? But... what if Jerry doesn't want me to, if we're married? Why wouldn't he? I mean, it's no secret you're smart. What if Jerry got pinned to you because you are? What if that's why he loves you and he wants you to go to college and have a job, and travel with you? Did you ever ask him? Mom used to be in charge in an airplane factory. Doesn't that mean girls can do all sorts of things? I bet Mom was the best worker there. She said maybe in the future moms can have jobs and still be moms, too. Maybe you should do what Dad does: ask questions. [car arrives] [honk honk] Thanks, Ellie. Ellie? My pictures. The ones for the kids. I was going to bring them today for Christmas Eve. But they're gone. You know, I think I might know where they are. Come on. Davey? You made the frames? Every kid deserves a real Christmas present. Right? He said it was okay. I-- I blew it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What I said-- No. You were right. I should have listened from the beginning. The pictures are really great. Thanks, Benjy. Actually, I have one other present. Knock-knock. Who's there? Mary. Mary who? Mary Christmas. So you can come back and see the doctors here for rehab and walk, maybe even bike with me and Davey by next Christmas. You did this? We all did. Everybody, together. So what do you think? I think I never expected Christmas in a hospital would be the best Christmas I've ever had. [giggling] Aw. Why didn't you tell me how great thinking about others would make me feel? [giggling] Do you think I could be an artist when I grow up? I think you could be anything you could dream of. And I can't wait to see you try. Hmm. Also, when we get home, I got you a pair of pants.

[giggling] I thought I wanted to be an only child for a while. Now I don't know what I was thinking. There are so many more people to share a day like this with. Why do you think I wanted such a big family? [giggle] Aw, I would have missed you if you went to Georgia all by yourself. Can I tell you a secret? Hmm. I really like our bright red door. - [chuckle] - It's extraordinary. I almost forgot. Your present. What? - What is it? - What is it? - Open it. - What is it? - What is it? - What is it? What is it?
