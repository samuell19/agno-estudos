I warned you! What do you want me to say? You want me to have any second pity for you? I mean... I told you, if you let him live with you, then... he'll take over. Just to acommodate him, you moved in into this little shit hole. There's no window and there's no closet. I use the one in the living room. Oh! How logical. I'm drunk. Oh my god! I'm so sorry, so, so, sorry. I'm sorry! Oh my god. He really butted in. Don't be mad at puppet, Troy! Let's go wipe your crotch. I'm an abstract vagina... painted by Merrick, on Stacey's bathroom until yesterday, but she's history, so I'm gonna take over Troy's pad now. Not my vagina, I might add. -He's using you. -I know. He's selfish and he's insidious. He's not just moving in, he's gonna borrow your car. I dated a kid for seven years. Look at him. "I'm a DJ, I smoke pot." It just seems so stupid. Parties, fun, girls... that have sex. It's pretty serious. Reason number 6. Okay...okay, we heard you! We are now playing "31 reasons". 31. 28. Grow! -I've got to go. -No, no, stay, hey! C'mon, we get more weed, we get more weed... Don't let him control you. Hey! Man, man...it's cool! Hey Deb, you're still working at that take out place? I'm in the Mall. The Mall! My Mall? You should bring your resume over to the bookstore, because I can get you a clubby job in the "Big Mall". Hey, need your property and you ain't my proxy, but some bitch motherfucker... Thank you. Yeah, hi, could you send a cab please? Tomato Hill. On 77. It's on its way. I won't be needing one. Yeah Stace, you will, because you don't live here, OK? You know what? Troy is my friend and he lives here, and you're the fucking idiot who lives with him! Yeah, and you're my guest and you're not welcome here anymore! OK? Alright? So you're leaving. Fuck you! Fuck you, you asshole! I'm a coffee table! No faculty approval, no grant money... pure chance. Where's the remote? You know, Stacey shouldn't have come over. What you think of that little movie top I set up there in the closet, eh? Yeah I noticed that. So, is there any room in there for my clothes or...what? Given the fact that you took away my bedroom. No, I don't think so. It's out of focus, though. It's a metaphore?! Our whole generation is out of focus, okay? Did you not learn that in grocery school? You don't make Stacey help you pack, man. That wasn't cool! That wasn't cool. Yeah but, Troy, she's a damn good packer. Besides, I didn't make her help me move. She volunteered, she practically begged. And you're not cool, OK? Why, remind me, exactly why she's sleeping in my bedroom? Why didn't you just drive her home? Now you hate me, I know. Do you? Yeah. Come on! I'm just a clerk in a video store. I know nothing of love. I know nothing of nurture or love. My back does need sympathetic hands. Hear me hands, feel my pain. Man, you just broke up with her after seven years. -Eight years. -Whatever. -She's a loser! -But you can have some compassion. But you're still my buddy, right? Man, can this place be like, yours and mine? Like, fully, even though you moved in first? You know, I am an awesome [???] fifth time around. You're a sloth, man. You won't clean the dirty dishes. and the darkness is my light... Plus, you never finish what you start. when nurture is a voyage, and... No. I'm designed for a better life than this. Sure, you're talented. I end up in "broad broom" film school, and drop it, and it... a place so dark... my dreams persist... Thanks. From this point on, no fear. One night we escaped and we left the cellar behind. But out there it's neither bright nor better, and it's void of friends. -Fowler! -I didn't see you! -How you doing? -What are you doing here, Fowler? I dunno. This is where... I come here to think. Here you are! Shit! There's the team captain! No, you wouldn't know her. Off and on, couple of years, having sex... Yeah...wicked. Yeah. She's moved in with me. Sort of moved in with me. I'm just afraid of commitment or something. Won't get close. Keep screwing around. Dump that! I've tried. Dump that! That's for sure. You know what, Troy? Don't... [???] look at a "poison book". That's for sure. Yeah, you think so? I think you're forgetting who you are. You're Troy, you know? We should talk to Donna. -Donna? -Yeah, Donna. Out in Van-loser! I only spoke because some guy has been stalking her or something. word is she's gonna be back in a couple of weeks. Hey, you know what? It's the [???] party going at Merchant's. I can feel it, you know? You think you'll ever get back? -What? -You and Donna. For, like, a re-match? No. Then... what's the matter buddy? You think I should dump that cold fish, huh? I hear you have a new boyfriend. Donald. It won't last. The guy likes science fiction, OK? Does Merrick know? -Troy! -What? Did I tell you? This guy...what's his name? Isaac As... -Asimov. -Asimov. -He loves him! -That's not true, I like... I like him, but you don't know Arthur C. Clarke. -You love him. -No, Arthur C. Clark... you know, "2001". I loved that, you know. Even he'll admit, he was the first to admit that... "The Sentinel", it's actually a short story, that actually... -Keep talking. -that's where... -Yes, keep talking! -it was only one of the... -Any of this bother you? -What? Him putting his hands all over her. Merrick doesn't know what he wants. Friday night I plugged him, and last night I gave him a blow job. Mmmmmm... I hate Merrick. Yeah...I don't know. I just know... You know what I mean? These people he hangs out with, I mean, they're juveniles! -They're using him, they're using him. -Exactly. I'm relishing it, you know. I love it. How lost he is. -No, no... -Yes! Stupid, stupid, stupid. What about your boyfriend? What boyfriend? Merrick. Not my boyfriend. I'm relaxed! You're a "wuff" for a wuss. I'm a jock. What the fuck, man! What's going on here, Troy? Merrick? Lousy friend, Merrick. I am? I'm a lousy friend... -Ok. Guys, guys... -Really lousy. There's fucking plenty of fish out there in the sea, right? And you take your fucking best friend's fish. You don't hang out with me! He doesn't hang out with me! Troy. We live in the same place, but we don't even hang out. What are you talk...? Merrick has just thrown a fucking awesome party... -and you're not... -Shut up! Power up your car. Now! So you're coming home with me, now. You're in denial, man. Honey? Stace? Hon, what's going on? Honey, honey? -I'm calling you a cab, baby. -What? No, no...don't do that! I pay my half of the rent, OK? I've no need of your little welcome, OK? You were late with half, Merrick! It's your free party, your juvenile friends, drugs, and alcohol. -Okay! -Yeah. You say some pretty nasty stuff, acting vindictively, don't even apologize. Stacey, I was drunk. I was drunk! He said you [???] his friend, Troy. We overreacted! Well, how would you feel? This is dumb. He's angry, Troy. Does he know I'm here talking to you? Is he staying here? In your bed? You know what, Troy? That's really none of your business. Yes. Last night was the best. So, are you two back together now? Or... I'm still sore. Gaze to the amulet. Succumb to the hypnotic power. Hey. Hey. So, did you think I lived here anymore? I need to...I just need to blow some steam. I'm just being a jerk. Again. So, does that mean that you two aren't reunited? I'm never going to see her again, I don't want anything to do with her, or wanna do anything with her. Serious. She needs help. Troy and Merrick...we're cool. Sorry. Say something! -Something. -Something else. I'm hard. You too. What are you doing? I care about you. More than friends. More than just friends, Merrick. I know. Why can't we kiss? Why is that we can do everything else but we can't kiss? You know how many times we've had this late night sexual things? Cause I don't. Merrick, this is major. I've lost count. Yeah. I have too, man. But, maybe, I don't care as much as you do. You're in denial. Troy, you're in denial. You suck my dick, you're in denial. I know what you envision, Troy. Why is that everything you say is purposely vague? Well then, why don't we kiss Troy? Tell me, why don't we kiss? Because I won't let you, Troy. I'm not gonna hurt you anymore. You're fucked. You're fucked up! I mean, do you think...? Why do you think that you moved in here with me? Stacey? You broke up with Stacey? She's the root of all your problems? Come on, Merrick. I mean, you honestly believe... that we fooled around this much, and you move in here, and you're not gay? I don't love you, Troy. Yeah! I'm not...! I think you are. Don't you sleepwalk into my dick. You're a liar! Dude... Don't touch me! Don't hurt me. I mean, I'm trying to be honest. You're in your... -I think that's good! -Shut up, Merrick. I'm not in denial. You know, high school's over. Merrick, these girls, this jock bullshit... -This is their... -Shut up, shut up! You're like some... You twist things! I don't understand you. I don't. -Are you bisexual? -I'm like everyone. I'm like everyone, man. I'm a blip on the Kinsey Scale. You're just human, man. OK, you can't be 100% any one thing, all right? Including gay. No, I'm pretty gay. Merrick, if you don't have feelings for me, then why you did this to me? -If you're some blip on a Kenney Scale... -Kinsey. Yeah, whatever. Whatever, Merrick. If you're some blip like everyone... Merrick, you know what's been going on in my head. Yeah, I'm a jerk. You know how pathetic I am now? I mean, what...? Why do you think I tried to kiss you? Why? Because I can't take... what we are or what we aren't anymore. Because every time we do stuff, I mean, we don't talk about it! I mean, we're like two statues. No, it had to happen tonight. Finally. Yeah, but, we're amazing now. We're having a moment. We are, we're sharing a moment, Troy. I do... Dude, I love you, but... I just can't do these things anymore, alright? Have sex? I can't...okay, I can't... I can't have sex with you, Troy. I mean, look at you! I can see how much I've hurt you! I'm not gonna do that anymore. OK, man? Because that's fear... and it's wrong. I'm not gonna listen to you. You aren't a blip. Merrick, you put it in my mouth and you wanted it. You put it in those cheerleaders, Troy! These bouncy cheerleaders. That's different, that's totally different. I mean, I got it going because I was visualizing... locker rooms and guys. Yeah, and I got it going because I was visualizing girls! OK? Girls, and tits, and ass, and cunts. And a hole is a hole, Troy. It's just a hole. Do you feel that? This fear, man. It's gone. It's true and...I know you don't know it now, but... if you turn the corner, man... I like girls, man. I happen to like women! Lots. And now... we're really honest. We're real friends. And now we can go out, and get really laid. Party on. You're right. You're totally right. I'm not gay! I mean, I'm not... I don't visualize guys. Not anymore. It's just you, Merrick. I'm alone. I know. Now we're real best friends. Being exceptionally difficult making decisions lately. The hangman's spirit should cut, but sometimes he proceeds in need. ...is fucking starving. Anyway, we get on the road... -It's still a lie. -Yeah. You made a wish? No, you're not going to find anyone like me in Toronto. Hello? Is this Raji? Is he late for work? I don't know where he is. Merrick! Where you've been? You're in a relationship? Sort of in a relationship. -Stacey? -Yes. Are you all right? Stacey? -Is Merrick with you? -No. Love is two-sided. As it then, you never want to play one-sided love. It's the worst kind of denial! You're there...handy like a dog, denied and rejected. It's a guess, but... ...DJ Raji? ...but you love him. Change. It's all a matter of change, but you... can't... Hey. Being like this is what I love. All of us! Mimi, Mercy, Sheila! Wicked. Well, no more party before I move up. Move up? What? Where you going? Where you going? -Hi Donna. -Hey Fowler. Oh my god, you look great! -Are you single... -I'll be back. bye, bye...or dating anybody? You look so good. You look great. "You look great." You look grumpy! What's the matter? No thanks, Fowler. I don't drink beer, you can have it. Don't bring me down, boy! Ex-girlfriend's here, don't fret. So, a cat's on a bike... -What cat? -The gay one. That's what they're whispering in there? Errr...the jocks are perfecly OK in denial, but otherwise... massive group identity crisis in there. Boys, they can say it to my face. I wish we were 9 again. That you caught me naked that time. And that mutant toad out of that construction house. So what are they saying about me? Who is Merrick, anyway? -Does he know you? -What are they saying about Merrick? -Was he a nerd? -No. -Was he in drama? -No. He was a rebel. -Have you missed me? -Yeah. And the sex? I miss it. I liked it. Did you ever really like it? -Yup. -"Yup." -Did you? -I don't know. You liked the benefits. Say my name. Say it! No, say it like before. Bitch. Nice! I asked you once if you were gay, while walking home from school one day, and you asked me: "does it matter?" -And did it? -No. We wouldn't have kept doing it, like we did. It was a contract. You got your image with the jock boys... -And what did you get? -I got you. I'm so over you. I'd like to be a kid again. I'm not really dealing with this whole adult thing. It's hard to deal with. You graduate from high school booze to a series of pot frat parties, and then you settle into urban hell. Urban job, urban brain busting traffic jams, yucky clothes, all day until five o'clock, and you could never leave your little work station. -Donna? -Mmm? So what's it like in Vancouver? It's pretty much the same as here. I thought any place outside of here would just rock. Actually, Vancouver is pretty awesome, man. It's a whole gay world. Especially the west end... there's no insects, there's no fast food, it's "you" in a nutshell. Troy, you've got to get out of here. Well, I'm moving to Toronto. -You know you take yourself with you. -Yeah, I don't wanna take myself. OK, I'm your big sister. I'm gonna give you some advice here. What? Look, I'm not the same girl who pom-pommed you. -I've evolved, okay? -Okay. OK, I don't care if you don't come to Vancouver, although I would like you to, but...get a life, Troy. -Why you stayed with me? -Troy, I dug you. You know, I remember the exact date, time, and TV show when I discovered you weren't into me? I caught you... I watched you in your wreck room stroking yourself to a male undergear catalogue. A crusty, stuck together male undergear catalogue... and I was your girlfriend! Sorry. Oh, you smell so good. I want to go for a drive. Wanna? Little drive? God, I remember everything like it was yesterday. Let me take you to BC. Just...don't be like Fowler, rotting away here. Yeah...don't be like Fowler. Do you love this Merrick dude? 'Cause, if he doesn't love you, he's fucked. So, these guys went to an after hours club in Toronto. Oh yeah, and why didn't you go? What? Why didn't you go to the after hours club? You haven't moved there yet. Where would I crash? Right. -You hate my new friends. -At least Debbie had a curfew. She flamed on the fire. Tomorrow I'm gonna leave my two-week resignation. They'll find it with the porno UPS in the morning. I'm so empty. You know, you're not gonna find anyone like me in Toronto, there. Noone's gonna compare to Merrick, even a wasted Merrick. -I'm gonna go close the garage. -I know. Safe! Look at those abs! Abs of steel. Merrick. We were just talking! Merrick, you fuck! -Stacey... -You fuck! Don't touch me, don't touch me! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me, you fuck! You fuck! Stacey. Hey. Stacey? Stace, I'm coming in! Stacey! Stacey! Are you...are you all right? Stace, hey. Hey. You know what? What? Merrick's the only one who's ever touched me. You've been here a long time. -Troy? -Yeah? What kind of faggot are you? -Fowler! -Hey, Troy. What are you doing, man? It's dark! Why...why...things have to change, Troy? They just do. Why don't things... ever turn out the way we expected them to? I mean...being 30 man. A wife, kids... all that shit. -Who's 30? -Me. If things keep going. Did you...? That's mine, I guess. How much did it cost you to get into the course, huh? I didn't do the math. I can beat computers. I guess I should have to fund myself into a big city center, no? Some day... Christ, Troy. You learn something... and it's, like, obsolete in six months, you know. I should know how... or at least keep up with that shit. Remember the kiss? You and Patty Fenwick? Down there. You remember that. That was your first kiss. -You remember that? -Yeah! It was a big deal. You and me, Patty, her friend Sheryl. What was that bitch's last name? Sheryl something... Patty's friend. Anyway, it was ten kisses, and you remember that. Me and Sheryl, right, we're sitting right here... and we're looking down at you, and... I'm totally giving her a peek, I'm sitting here with Sheryl, thinking... fuck! maybe I should, like, kiss her or something. -Did you kiss her? -No, I didn't kiss her. Hey, you ever deal with that...problem? -Problem? -Yeah. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, problem's gone. Yup. Moved back to... I thought I might be having a kid. Shitty. -Who cares, alright? -Yeah, who cares. You know, Fowler? For once, man, everything... everything's just cool, you know. Everything's cool. Yeah, it's cool. You know, you're gonna be fine when you go. You always were the man, right? In high school everybody was always coming up to me, you know, and always said, Troy... Troy's the man. None of like that for me, no. What was wrong with me? Hey, man. What's wrong with me? I don't like that. I don't like that, OK? Okay? What, are you gay...Troy? Fowler, man! What... Who are you running from? -Man, you're being weird! -You're weirding me out, Troy. Come on! Look at you. You're panicking. You're panicking! Just don't ever touch me again, OK? Don't be gay, OK? Are you? You know what? Fuck you! Did you catch all that? He's probably running off to out me, to Merchant and the boys. I went by the pad. All your stuff's gone, man. Everything except for a sleeping bag and a box. My dad borrowed a truck, we did all yesterday. You're so organized! My course starts Monday. Shit, you know? Just being here makes me want to buy a protector set. This is where you played all these big games? The ones I never went to? You're scared. So, Stacey's not pregnant! So, these were the last beers we're gonna have in our pad. Yup. So, why isn't she pregnant? ...I wanted to do the other night when she caught us. You're inebriated. I need it not to be scared. This is good. I'm hard for you. Listen... I know you don't want to be friends with me anymore, -Merrick. -but... No. Get off me! I'm sorry. It's no problem. So, you're suddenly gay for me and... you know, this fucks me up Merrick! Fuck! You don't even know. I'd like to sleep with you, please. You know...you always were a coward. You were a coward back in high school. I remember you, Fowler, and the rest of the other jock bozos. You were the biggest bozo. But you weren't like them, you were different. I remember... you on those military green cargo pants. I thought about you back then... ...sexually. It must be love 'cause... I suppose it's cheesy to say that I remember... I remember that time that you walked into my art class after school, and you asked what I was painting, and you said you liked it. Pure cheese. I think about you when I jack off. I've tried... I've tried not to think about you when I jack off, but just... There you are! Stop. Don't be afraid. But I am. That first night, why did it happen? Maybe it was meant to happen. I need you. I love you. You don't need me. Maybe I do. No, you're just desperate for something. Yeah? I am desperate. My whole world's imploding... like it's backwards... and sucking me up. I told Stacey everything about us yesterday. She is pregnant. She is. For real. She's pregnant! She is... She's pregnant. She's pregnant. How is that possible? I told her everything. Every detail about you and me. There is no "you and me". Thanks. I'm sick of these head games. I'm sick of them! I mean, are you or you're not gay? Is she or she's not pregnant? Are you a DJ or you're an artist? You're immature, Merrick! You know what?, I have to take a rational road that suits me, that is healthy and mature! Have you been watching Oprah? No, reading. I don't like your reading. I'm leaving... I'm leaving this crowy place. I'm exhausted! -I loose... -No. to her I guess, to you. I mean, you could blow me here right now, but I'm... I'm crossing your bridge tomorrow, and I'll disappear. Maybe I'll jump from this bridge. I'd really like to stay, but you are suddenly the Merrick in my head. You're the bad Merrick. The real one. Tomorrow, even if it sucks, I'll be some place where denial is a crime, and... you'd be locked up! Why am I scared? Your control is slipping away. That's what I am? Out of control. But you're supposed to control me. I can't. You need me! You're not homosexual! You're Merrick-sexual! Have you ever done another guy? Yeah. In the International Seminar in Toronto, twice. I'm jealous! Did you like it? I'm not "Bad Merrick"! No, you are. I'm sorry that I've hurt you. You destroyed me. I'm sorry. No, I'm the idiot, I stuck around. You're a beautiful idiot. You're a beautiful idiot. Stop! -I wish we were drunk. -Yeah, but we're not. Hey. Hey. This is it. -You OK? -Yeah. Take care. Yeah. You too, dude. It's my number in Toronto. Just go, man. You're laughing. I'm sorry. You know really I am...I am. That's the first time we kissed. I know. Start feeling human? Yeah. So what happens next? Good bye.
