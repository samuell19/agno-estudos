♪♪ News of the impending meteor strike has caused widespread panic across the nation. Reports of mass looting, riots, and fires have been triggered by warnings issued by a NASA scientist that the world may end if this giant asteroid hits the planet. ♪♪ Traffic has ground to a halt as people try to flee to safety. All main arteries in and out of major metropolitan areas are literally parking lots. Find security, find Tim Harrison. Stop him in the parking lot if you have to. Stop Harrison before he leaves. Don't let him get away. Hey, hey! Hey, wait a second! Stop! Hey! Damn it, come on! - Hello, Clay. - What the hell were you thinking, Tim? Did you really expect me to sit on my hands and let half the southeast go down? I'm sorry, not on my watch. It wasn't your decision. NEO has protocols, you know that. My protocol is saving lives. Your job is to track asteroids. Not to report an unsubstantiated impact probability to CNN. Clay, we're talking a "five" on the Torino Scale here. This thing's as big as a football field and traveling forty times the speed of sound. The public has a right to know. At what cost? You've started a widespread panic. Cities are on the verge of utter chaos. There are reports of looting and rioting. I ran the data ten times. Your data could be wrong. A good algorithm never lies, Clay. Especially mine. All right, you know what? That IAU report was confidential. You violated National Security. This is National Security! Right here, right now! You know, instead of arguing with me, maybe you should go home to your family. You know what, Tim? It's out of my hands. All right, tell me how bad it is. The porosity composition... Damn it. You ready, baby? - I'm so scared. - It's okay. - We're gonna be okay. - Okay. Come on, buddy. Daddy, is the sky really falling? Well, part of it is, buddy. But by the time that happens, we're gonna be safe, okay? Here we go. We have so much more stuff upstairs. We haven't got time for that. What about Mike and Teresa? They've got seven hours to get out of the impact zone. Can you strap him in? Yeah. How's that? Is that too tight? A federal warrant has been issued for the arrest of NEO scientist Tim Harrison for violating National Security. His report of a Doomsday... Okay, he's asleep. If this is the end, I'm so glad we're together as a family. We're gonna be okay. But I wouldn't want to be with anybody else. It's so beautiful out here. Yeah, Herb likes his solitude. He has a much better view of the stars out here. He's eccentric. Yeah, he is. But Herb's basically just a regular guy. Like me. Yeah. Just like you. Except that he's a billionaire, and has a satellite company. And a fallout shelter. The government has issued warnings for everyone to try to seek shelter underground wherever possible. The asteroid has caused widespread panic throughout much of the United States. Herb, we're here. We're continuing our report on a giant asteroid that will impact Earth within the next thirty minutes. Herb. Tim. Thanks for this. Hey, you're my little brother, you know? Ah, Stella, even under these circumstances you look ravishing. You're so sweet. Remember Herbert? Ah, You're not my dad's brother. Well, actually, Herb is what they call a "big brother". Yeah, well that's you know, because your- your dad didn't have a big brother when he was growing up. - I've got this, I've got this. - Thank you. I have it. Yeah, we better get underground now because in about eighteen minutes these puppies are gonna light up the sky. Should be quite a show, actually. Okay, bear with me. I'm still doing some construction. Yeah, yeah, hand me the weapon. Alright, good. Ah grab your gear, I'll figure out where to stow it. See, I got these bedrooms are still a work in progress. Bathroom. This is nice, Herb. It's bigger than I expected. Yeah, I call it the Waldorf. Uh, kitchen in there and store room. And this is kind of general living, or will be general living area, rec room. You gotta use your imagination of course, but... Wow. And here is Mission Control. I repeat, take shelter and stay there. Asteroid C816 will be entering Earth's atmosphere within seconds. This is a live NASA space feed. Impact should occur in approximately three minutes. Here we go. What? What's going on? It's a damn meteoroid cluster. I must have misinterpreted the porosity and composition data. We're now going to Dr. Clay Adams, uh, NASA's Director of NEO, The Near Earth Object Observation Program. Dr. Adams, can you explain what just happened? Yes, this supposed killer asteroid was nothing more than a group of meteoroids bound together by gravity most of which will burn up in our atmosphere long before ever reaching Earth. And those that don't? There will be limited fallout, although hardly the national catastrophe that had been erroneously predicted. Oh, now they'll have to discredit you to cover their own bureaucratic butts. So you're saying Earth is no longer in any danger? Earth was never in danger, which NEO had asserted from the very beginning. People would be wise not to scare the public with such claims in the future. I regret the untold consequences caused by the needless alarm that was sounded. Everyone's gonna be okay. - Okay, thank you Dr. Adams. - You're welcome. Unfortunately, though, that's not the case. Reports of looting and rioting have apparently left three people dead. - Oh, my God. - We will have more information on that - Oh, my God. - When it becomes available. Tim, you made the right call. NEO had no idea they were dealing a cluster. I would have made the same assessments if I were in your shoes, and that's the truth. What does this mean? Tim? Meteoroids enter Earth's the atmosphere every day. Thousands of them. Most weight only a few milligrams, so we don't even notice. In fact, astronomers estimate that over seven hundred tons of space debris land on this planet every week. But little, if none of it, comes from Bode's Galaxy. Now why is that? Hmm? Because it's too far away? Wrong for two hundred dollars. Anyone else? Too close to the sun? Wrong for three hundred bucks. Come on, people. Hello, texter in the third row. Hi. Any answers? No? The reason is because it's a black hole. Kinda like you. Knowledge gets sucked in, nothing ever comes out. At least I'm not teaching at a second-rate college 'cause I got fired from NASA. Glad to see you're actually doing some sort of homework. And yes, I was fired. But by disparaging this college as second-rate you're not only insulting me, you're insulting the rest of your classmates who all have very good grades because they're not texting in class. Another one bites the cosmic dust. A reminder, the natural universe can be a very dangerous place. All right, that's it. More on this tomorrow, it's good stuff. Now get outta here. You're in a mood today. Or is this just what happens when you're java deprived? All work and no coffee make Tim a dull boy. I ran out again this morning. I'm still trying to work on how to shop for one. Hey, you were single once in your life. Don't remind me, Julia. Still not worth letting Mr. Texter get under your skin. You know, maybe it's just this time of year. You're always mopey in May. Me? Mopey? Tim, I have been your T.A. for three years and your doctoral student for two. Oh yes, May. The month the proverbial asteroid hit the fan. Uh, and don't forget... Shut off the lights and grab the computers. Thanks, you're the best. I know what to do. - Julia. - Hey, Ian. What are you doing here? I'm really hoping I can get you to join me tonight at the lake. There's gonna be a big bonfire, music. It's gonna be a blast. I'd really love it if you came along with me. I'm sorry, I can't. My head is all wrapped in my dissertation, I've gotta input some new data. And if I were there I probably wouldn't be much fun. All right. You know, one of these nights you're gonna come out with me and we're gonna have a great time. Deal? Deal. Have a good time. Julia, what are you doing here? I have a dissertation to write. And my roommate likes to party. This place is quiet and not Starbucks. What's your excuse? The department wants me to publish if I want tenure. I thought this might be a good time to start to reclaim my reputation. Besides, I hate working from my apartment. - Well, if I'm interrupting... - No, no. I- I like the company. Just keep it down over there. I'm actually, I'm glad you're here. Do you remember those two NEO's I've been tracking the last few months? Yeah. You mention the acronym Near Earth Object and I just stop listening. It's better for my career. Understood, but given you are my academic advisor, I need you to take a look at this. If my calculations are correct, and both asteroids maintain their projected paths, the gravitational pull of Venus could nudge a smaller asteroid from its current trajectory. Asteroids get diverted all the time. Well true, but this would cause them to collide redirecting the larger asteroid, Triton Z32, towards Earth. It still seems like a big "if". What makes you think they're PHA's? Oh, I ran all the probabilities. Here, they're on the next page. Triton Z32's almost four kilometers in diameter. That makes it half the size of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. If something that big hit, it'd decimate the Earth. I know. And nobody's even tracking it. I checked all the online databases for NEOshield, Spaceguard, and NEODys. And they're not on the Sentry Risk Table? No. Then your calculations must be wrong. If your theory is even remotely possible, someone has to know about it. You know that nobody, not even NASA, can, can track every rock in the sky. Walk me through your hypothesis. Oh. Yeah? No. Uh, I'm just running a little late, I'm on my way. Yeah, okay. Sorry. Damn it. I've got Nick, I completely forgot. I'm gonna have to fly. I'll take a look at this later, okay? - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Dad. I guess you forgot, just like Mom said. Forgot? No way. We got a date every Wednesday night. You think I'd blow off my best bud? Just got a little preoccupied with work. All right, what are we eating? - Your call. - Burgers. Burgers, again? Is that all you eat? All right burgers it is. That's Cygnus Xone, right? Yeah. I see you've been keeping up. Some nights before bed I, uh, check out your telescope. Really? Yeah. Reminds me that you're still here. You know, Herbert gave me that telescope when I was thirteen and he was Chief Technologist at NASA. You can have it back if you want. No, that's okay. My apartment doesn't have much of a view. You can say that again. So, is your mom still seeing Peter? Yeah. He's okay. But? He's not you. Well, it's been a long time since I've been me, Nick, which is why I don't blame her. You know, your mom was so proud of me after we first got married. She loved telling people I worked at NASA. Especially your grandpa, who, truth be told, wasn't my biggest fan. Though he did come around. You know what, I don't think your mom even knew what I did at my job. But that didn't matter. What mattered was that she trusted me. That I'd given her a future. That I'd become someone that she could always be proud of. And in one day that all changed. What I wouldn't give to take that day back. It's not like mom loves Peter or anything. Oh, and what would you know about love? Hey, I got game. Oh, you do, do you? I might even be able to give you some pointers. Is that so? I mean, when you start dating. And how do you know I'm not already dating? 'Cause you still haven't signed the divorce papers and it's been almost a year. Mom wanted me to remind you again. I haven't forgotten. All right, so same time next week? If you haven't got anything on this weekend, give me a call. We can hang. Did I just say that? I'm sorry. Okay. Gotcha. - Bye, Dad. - See ya. Hey. Your first class just started. Oh, crap. It's all right. Um, I can take over. Not that. It's your dissertation. What? You-you-you think that... No. It's remarkable. I ran the numbers. I really think you're onto something. Really? I'm gonna need a second opinion. Can you get over to my class while I make some calls? Yeah, um thank you. Don't thank me. I really hope you're wrong. So do I. So what do you think? Well, I must say, her findings are very compelling. Pretty impressive when you consider that she's only a 25 year old T.A. I will, however, run my own calculations for myself. But I certainly hope this Julia isn't attractive as well. Why do you say that? Well, brains and beauty, that's a rare combination. And it's always been my weakness. Not that you're Julia's type, but you don't even have time for the ladies. You said so yourself. But I can always dream, though, can't I? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Julia is definitely easy on the eyes. I knew it. Say no more. And since I'm out of the picture, I guess you should you know uh... Thanks. We're just friends. Still Stella, huh? Listen here, if Julia is correct, then we're facing an impact event that could destroy most of North America. And be a global catastrophe for the rest of the planet. So you need to alert the NEO, Tim. You know I can't do that. At least not yet. Well, what are you going to do? You ca-- you can't sit on all this information. I'm gonna call in a favor. From whom? - You, big brother. - Hmm? I need more proof before I go to Clay. The weather satellites don't show me enough. And yours is the only company that can get me a clear view of the asteroid belt's Region Nine. Uh, now, now, hold on there, Timmy boy, hold on. Do you know how much it costs to reprogram a satellite? I mean, we're talking about disrupting cell phone service for thirty million people. Not to mention, I have stockholders and- and a Board of Directors that I must answer to. Herbert, you won't have a Board of Directors if this asteroid hits. Yeah, by God, you're right. Tim? What are you doing? I um, I miss this part of my life. Do you want to come in and say goodnight to Nick? Is that okay? Yeah. Hey buddy. Damn. Oh, sorry, Dad. Watch your mouth. What're you doing? Turning my dumb TV into a smart TV. Well just be careful, this stuff's expensive. Don't worry, Dad, I know what I'm doing. Okay, Mr. Fix It. So what brings you over here tonight? I came here to see you. And I gotta talk to your mom about something important. If it's about divorcing, she still loves you, Dad. Hey, I live with her. I should know. You okay? Yeah. Why? No offense, but it seems like you're on another planet. Okay, Nicky, you gotta go to bed. Can I talk to you for a second, outside? Yeah. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, buddy. Goodnight, Nicky. Goodnight. Stop. Are you hearing yourself? You don't work for NASA anymore. No, I'm aware of that. Shh. Tim. Do you remember, because I remember. You lost your job, we almost lost this house. You almost went to prison. Yes, yes I remember. And I stood by you for all those years, even when you didn't stand by yourself. And you got booted. Now you're a professor. Just be happy with that, can you? Please don't do this. Please don't. Please don't do this to our family. Do you want to be that guy and be blamed again? I can't change you, Nick can't change you. Only you can. And this is about you. This was never about me, Stella. It is. You spend so much time looking up in the stars that you forget about what's important right here on Earth. Please. Sign the divorce papers, Tim. Couldn't sleep? Something like that. Me either. Anymore from Herbert? Not yet. I'm hoping to hear from him tonight. I have to say, he's very impressed with you. And Herbert doesn't get impressed easily. Really? Well the guy's a genius. By age four he'd read the entire "World Book" encyclopedia cover to cover. And by seven he'd written a paper on Newton's Law of Gravity. Hmm. That every object has an attractive force. The closer the distance Yeah, all that. I'm sorry, that was so completely inappropriate. No, it was fine. It was nice. I like you. Um... It's okay. You- you don't have to say anything. I- I like you, too. It's just... I know, your situation. It was a weak moment. Let's just forget it ever happened. That's him. Herb. Hi Tim. Oh, and I suppose you're Julia. Hi. I've heard so much about you. It's nice to finally meet you in person. I mean... And I've heard so much about you. Excellent work, by the way. And uh, also you are as beautiful as Tim has described you. You said I was beautiful? And uh, that you two were merely friends. So just to let you know, I'm available. Well I will be sure to remember that. So, did your satellite turn up anything in Region Nine? Unfortunately, yes. It appears that uh, Julia's data is correct. We've got an eight on the Torino Scale. It's bound for earth kids. How fast and how far away? Uh, it's 30 kilometers per second. Almost 7.7 LD's. That's less than seventeen hours away. Did you just figure that out in your head? It should arrive approximately 8:15 tonight. Expect showers from that smaller asteroid, which'll get here a hell of a lot sooner. Hundred of Bolides will light up the sky, which well you know, would be something to see in our lifetime. But I hardly think that we would survive it. Who else knows? No one. It won't be a secret for long. Nor should it be. Why don't we alert NEO? I suppose they wouldn't take Tim's warning seriously. They'll probably treat it as a rumor just to stay ahead of the story, you know. Yeah, Herbert's right. Clay won't confirm anything publicly until he has to. Julia, I'm so sorry to meet you under such grave circumstances. But I do think you two should get up here before the word gets out. You do not want to get caught in the city. What about your Impactor? Oh, we'll talk about deflection solutions um, if there are any, when you get here. But, you know, in the meantime, get going. And God speed. Yeah, see ya. I understand your reluctance to contact NEO, but why wouldn't they take Herbert's warning seriously? About five years ago he designed an Impactor to steer away a NEO. He spent millions of his own money and hundreds of millions of NASA's. But the AutoNav system and control software were rife with glitches. It never worked. And he's never really gotten over it. They launched? Yeah, it's- it's up there in orbit somewhere. What do I tell Stella? The truth. She's not interested in the truth. At least not mine. This is not the time to focus on that. I gotta swing by my place and get some things. You get what you need and you meet me at my... Stella's house in an hour, okay? What are you doing? - It's four o'clock in the morning. - It's happening again, Stella. Hello. Is this Director Adams? Who is this? Uh, you don't know me. Uh, my name is Julia Waters, I'm a graduate student. How did you get this number? Hello. Hello? Go back to bed, sweetie. It's nothing. Hi. My name is Julia Waters and I'm- I'm not asking that you believe what I'm about to tell you. Even if you do, I'm not sure what can be done except- except to just hold each other tight and- and say all the things that you've been holding back because, there's not a lot of time left. At approximately 8:15 tonight, the world as we know it may cease to exist. An asteroid, half the size of the one that killed off the dinosaurs, will hit Earth unless somebody can find a way to deflect it. Nobody can predict the amount of damage that will occur because we've never experienced something of such great magnitude. If you have anywhere to take shelter, then do it. I- I don't know what good it will do, but we've gotta try. I can't force you to go, but Nick's my kid, too, and I'm gonna keep him safe. No matter what you do or don't believe. What if she's wrong? She's a T.A. She's your assistant. She hasn't even done her dissertation. Then you have nothing to worry about. I'll have him back in three days. Stella, I checked out her data. So did Herbert. I know you don't want to hear this, but unfortunately she's correct. Suit yourself. Why are you being so stubborn! Mom. No. Nicky, this is between me and your father. Please, go back to your room. And I'm between both of you. Whatever you think about Dad, he wouldn't be here right now if he wasn't sure. Stella, I know how you feel, but I'm asking you to trust me on this. You already used up that trust card. Please Stella, I'm- I am begging you now. If not for me, for our son. For this family. We're not a family anymore. That's the point, isn't it? I am done discussing this. I'll get it. Come on, buddy. Pack a bag. Take only what you need. Is everyone ready? What is she doing here? I don't remember your ex-wife being so pretty. The two of you still look like you kinda go together. Looks can be deceiving. Maybe not as deceiving as you think. It should take us about five or six hours to get to Herb's. Hopefully we don't run into too much traffic. My dad said you were the one who figured this whole thing out. Oh, I can't take all the credit for that. Well you should. It was brilliant work. Well, I did learn from the best. Why are you taking Highway Eleven? It's not even rush hour. There's no traffic. - I thought the back way would be safer. - Safer? Yeah, once the story breaks every road in this state will be grid-locked. Then we're stuck. Excuse me, you've never been to Herbert's place. Your point? You don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Mom. That's not cool. Cool? Highway Eleven takes an extra hour. And if the rain comes, then the river's gonna wash the road out. That's funny. All I see are clear skies. Fine. I'll take the Interstate. Thank you. All right, show me what you have. Sentry prioritized the object for impact analysis and automatically added it to the queue. La Sagra then reported a collision of two NEO's that occurred near Venus last night. And this is the first time we're aware of it? No. M.S.F. in Huntsville has been tracking Triton Z32 and Julius 19 for years. But we never paid much attention because neither posed a threat. Well, and now? The collision possibly created an impact scenario. Possibly or probably? We're triple checking the orbital computations and risk estimates, from what it seems like, Triton Z32 is now veering in the direction of Earth, though. How close? Well, we estimate the asteroid will pass within four hundred thousand miles. Though we anticipate meteoroids from Julius 19 to go terrestrial. Where could they hit? We need to know so we can avoid mass panic. We're analyzing all the data - to determine potential impact sites... - Director Adams. - Yeah, just a second. - You need to see this. My name is Julia Waters and... What the hell is this? - ...I'm not asking you to believe... - What the hell? ...what I'm about to tell you. ...except to just hold each other tight and, and say all the things that you've been hold-- You have like, two hundred thousand hits. Huh? On your video. You're famous. What's he talking about? I uploaded a video so that people could prepare themselves. Julia, you shouldn't have done that. Great. People deserve to know the truth. And you know, Stella, they have families, just like you. Or, I don't know, maybe you don't care about anyone else's except your own. Of course I do. You just don't want to have pandemonium, chaos, looting, and possible death on your shoulders, either. By the way, you don't know anything about me. Oh no? Actually, for the past year and a half all I've heard about is you. Why can't Stella forgive me? Why won't Stella give our marriage a second chance? - Why can't Stella-- - Julia. I know a lot more than I want to know about you. Well I know a lot about you, too. What's that supposed to mean? I know you've had a thing for my husband since undergrad. Stella. No, it's true. I see the way that you look at him. This was a bad idea. Let me out of the car. Julia, don't be ridiculous. You're being irrational. Irrational? No, I'm sorry, you guys are, you guys are all a family. I'm not. I don't belong here. I'm not letting you out on the side of the road, so just forget it. Well, it's not your decision, so just let me out of the car. All right, stop. Nobody's going anywhere. And I'm done listening to any more crap from both of you. Now we're gonna be stuck in this car a long time and in Herbert's bunker for God knows how much longer. So you two better start getting along. 'Cause we're stuck with each other. You understand? Are we clear? Yeah. I guess. Good. Now we need to get some gas. You didn't fill up earlier? No! This road trip was kind of unexpected. Okay. Let's see if there's anything on the radio. A video posted on social media warning of a giant asteroid hitting the planet has gone viral and the public is starting to panic. NEO has yet to make an official statement confirming or denying the potential threat. Police departments in several cities have warned people to stay inside as stores are being looted and robbed by mobs of people fearing the end of the world is near. Dean Dugan? That would be me. Agent Grimes. We spoke on the phone earlier. Yes, Sir, good morning. Your warrant? What's so important in Professor Harrison's office that you need this? Unfortunately, I can't divulge that information, Sir. National Security. What can you tell me about Tim Harrison? Well, he's been with the university seven years now. And Julia Waters? She's been his T.A. ever since. Agent Grimes, Tim Harrison is a trusted colleague and a friend. The students love him. That's good to know. The man is up for tenure. FBI? National Security? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I can't imagine Tim would be involved in anything illegal. Check everything. Computers, files, even the damn trash. You want anything? Coffee. Milk, no sugar. I know. I need to know the last time anyone saw Julia Waters and Tim Harrison. Fine. Whatever you need, Agent Grimes, we'll do. Hello? Julia, it's Ian. What the hell is going on? The FBI are in Dr. Harrison's office. They've got search warrants, guns, everything. Listen, I can't talk right now. Get someplace safe, okay, preferably underground, and stay there. Okay? That's what I'm doing. - What are you talking about? - Just do it. I gotta go. You be careful. It's gonna be bad for awhile. Who are you calling? Peter. I was going to tell him to be careful, but I can't get through. Is that okay? Here. FBI just searched your office. - What? - Yeah. We gotta get there fast. Something of such great magnitude. That's her, ain't it? If you have anywhere you can take shelter, then do it. Yeah, that sure is her. Hey, I bet they're going somewhere safe. Hey, take what we need and let's boogie. I don't want them getting too far ahead of us. I'll grab some beer. Come on, boy, let's go! Come on! Elaine, I need you with me. - Alex, come on. - What's going on, sir? We got a call coming in from the FBI. Apparently they've tracked down who this woman is on the YouTube video. Okay. Go ahead, Agent Grimes. We've removed Julia Waters' video from the web. But it's gone viral. FBI is taking them down as fast as they're uploaded. So far, almost half a million views and counting. Julia Waters. She called me at my house last night. When I asked how she got my number, she hung up. Who is this woman? She's a graduate student in Astronomy with an IQ of 157. I met this woman at a conference last year. The lady's a supercomputer. Her dissertation is on asteroid impact avoidance. Her advisor is your former employee, Dr. Tim Harrison. Tim is involved in this? Well she recorded the video on his computer. I'd say that's an affirmative. Several news organizations have contacted the agency to verify the story. Apparently they received a mass email from an unknown source with details of the impact and it's from Harrison's IP address. This is either payback, or a feeble attempt at redemption. Whatever it is, we can't stall much longer. I'd say you got about an hour before a network runs with the story. Then all bets are off. Well we better issue a statement now. I mean, that way NEO looks like we're on top of the situation. You're gonna find them and arrest them, correct? Dr. Adams, is what they're predicting true? There's a high probability. Then why would I arrest them? I'm gonna spend whatever time we have left with my family. What'd he say? The damn world's about to end. NEO Director, Clay Adams, has issued a statement confirming the possible impact from Triton Z32. People are encouraged to seek shelter underground, if possible... Hello, Herb. - Where are you? - Just passing Rolling Fork. You gotta drive faster. The first meteors are starting to enter the Earth's atmosphere. How much time do we have? Not enough. Meteors have entered the Earth's atmosphere and destroyed hundreds of buildings. The amount of casualties is unknown but expected to be in the thousands. This is just the precursor to the big one. It looks like the end is near unless something can be done to stop this. God help us. They've broken the sound barrier. Where are they? I don't see anything. You will soon enough. Drive faster! Everybody hold on! Nicky! Hang on! Oh, my God. Dad, look out! The meteors, they've stopped. You mean, we're safe? Don't bet on it, son. Dad! They're getting closer! Whoa! Hold on! Whoa! Ouch. My door is stuck. The car won't start. I'm gonna call Herbert, get him to pick us up. Everybody grab your stuff. Nicky, you okay? Yeah, fine. Damn it. The network's jammed. How about you? I'm getting the same thing. Yeah, I got nothin' on emergency either. Word must finally be out. - Oh my God, am I bleeding? - Yeah. What are we gonna do? All right, my GPS is still working. If we cut through these woods, there's a trail that leads close to Herbert's place. What? That's 20 miles away, Tim. Hey, but we might not ever get through by phone, so we don't really have another option. Plus, this trail shaves off about eight miles. Nick, that's 12 miles you gotta walk. Can you do it? I can do it, Mom. It's gonna be like five or six hours. We gotta go. Can I hold the knife? No. Let's go. Do you want to take a break? No. Nicky's fine. Are you sure? Okay. So, how'd you get into astronomy? Well I was kind of a geeky kid. I was always more interested in books than toys, and planets than people. Really? Why are you so surprised? 'Cause you're like totally hot. I shouldn't have said that. Hey, it's okay. You know a girl can't hear enough compliments. Especially from a cute young man. Looks like our son has a crush on your T.A. Yeah, he could do worse. Julia's a good person. She's a good friend. And I needed one after I moved out. I'm sure you did. Oh, come on. I mean it. How much further? I don't know. Maybe nine or ten miles. We gotta keep going. As cities continue to be pummeled by meteors, The White House has been evacuated. All government employees have been sent home to be with their loved ones. The President is en route to a secret location where he will monitor the situation. All right, listen up, people. That was the White House. They've evacuated the President to his Emergency Operations Center along with his entire Cabinet. They're preparing for the worst. I think it's time we did the same. If any of you have loved ones you need to get home to, I understand. I thank you for your service. I'm not leaving if you're not. General. We need to come up with a deflection campaign, fast. Let's see. Yeah, that's their car. You think they took to the woods or the street? There's a bunch of caves up that way. That'd be a place to hide. Come on. They got a plan, right? I mean, we're not just walking in the woods. You heard her. They know exactly where they're going. Still on the trail? Yeah. We still got a chance. It's taking a lot longer than I thought. You want a drink, buddy? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Still no reception? Herbert doesn't know if we're dead or alive. He's not gonna give up on us. What was that? What'd you see, Nicky? Shh. Get down! Is everybody okay? What was it? Was there anyone out there? No, I just, I found this. What is that? It's candy. I'm sure it's from somebody hiking. Can I see it? It's still sticky. It's not old. We're not alone. Okay, let's not get too dramatic. Let's just keep moving. Yeah. The best option would be a kinetic impact to ram the asteroid out of its orbit. Unfortunately, we don't have time to deploy a spacecraft that can do that. Then we agree. A nuclear solution is the only alternative at this point. Only as a last resort. I think we're past that, Clay. Richard, there is a chance the missile could split the asteroid in two, only making things worse. That's a chance we'll have to take. I feel like we're being watched. Or stalked. Right. It's definitely creepy out here. Stay close to me. They're close. Come on, guys, let's go! Come on, let's go. Can you see it? No, come on. Come on! Tim! Where the hell do you think they are? It's gonna be dark soon. What do you wanna do, huh? Stop? Get down on your knees, pray for salvation? All I'm saying is, they might be so far ahead of us, we might not be able to catch up. Then you turn on around and go on back. I'm seeing this thing through to the end. Now let's take a quick break. All right. Catch our breath. Thanks. If we don't make it to the fallout shelter, what'll happen to us? What do you mean? From the impact. Will it, like, vaporize us? Nobody is getting vaporized, okay? We still have time to make it to Herbert's. I just wanna know if I'm gonna feel any pain. I promise you that you will not feel a thing. As long as it doesn't hurt I'll be okay. Hey, we are all gonna be just fine, okay? Even if it doesn't feel like that right now. You know what? Sometimes people, they have a way of just knowing some things. And one thing that I know, I'm gonna see you grow up. All right, guys, we should keep moving. Hold up, hold up. All right, come on, let's go. Why don't you walk with Daddy, keep him company? All right. Thank you for talking to Nick. I don't know what to say about all this. You're really good with him. I misjudged you. Sorry. It's okay. I judged you, too. I only heard one part of the story, and it was the side I wanted to hear. Right. You love him, don't you? It's okay, you can tell me. Why are you asking me this? I guess I'm just thinking that if something happens, that it's I don't know. You're good with him, I'm sure you're good with Tim, I'm okay with that. Thank you. You know, Tim could never love me the way that he loves you. Hold on. Whoo! Hey there. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. You need something? Same as you. To live. Hmm. I don't understand. I heard your boy talking about a fallout shelter on some farm. Thought you might let a good Christian man, like myself, come along. Uh-huh. Well, you must've heard wrong, mister. - Oh? - There is no shelter. Yeah, you- you misunderstood. Yeah? Then where y'all headed? We aren't headed anywhere. We're actually We're- we're just lost. He wasn't talking to you. You sure don't sound lost. You sound like you're lying. Listen, we're just trying to find a safe place to shelter before this asteroid hits. Out here in the middle of nowhere? You must think we're really stupid. Hey, shut up, Kirk. Here's some supplies, just take whatever you need. Supplies? I don't want supplies. Hey, listen. Hey, don't touch that knife. Or the next one that moves gets shot. Great. Now why don't you lead us to that farm of yours? Come on, pretty boy. - Ahh. - Go ahead, get it. Police are warning of roving gangs that are looting and burglarizing homes and businesses. Go on. What the hell? Hey! Who the hell are you! And how'd you get through that gate? I smashed the gate down with the truck. Don't you realize that the world is coming to an end, man? You've got five to get outta here! One! - Two! - We have to help each other! - Three! - We have to help each other! - Keep moving. - Geez. - What? - Hey. We should be out of these woods by now. I thought you knew where you were going. Do I look like Daniel Boone? Who's Daniel Boone? He's a fur trader with a... Wait. What's that? Uh-oh. Everybody get down! - Come here, come here. - Get me out! - Get me out of this! - Come here, come here. Get me out of this! Ah, you're bleeding bad, buddy. Hurry, pull me out! Sorry, I can't do that, old friend. What do you mean, you can't? Get them to do it! And then what? You want them to carry you? There ain't no time for that. And you know we can't slow down. Not with that asteroid coming. Come on, you can't just leave him. What do you care? That means more room for us in that fallout shelter, and more food. Now keep moving. What, are you stupid, girl? No! No, don't shoot him! Don't shoot. You don't have to worry about him anymore. You guys, we have to go. - We have to go now. - What about him? - Well, he's hurt. Please! Just follow us, come on. Edee! Edee! Right here. Come on! Instead of threatening to kill us, you should have offered to help. When your buddy wakes up, you better hope he helps you. Please don't leave me! Please! You all right? Yeah. You? Yeah. Sam Desser. - This is my daughter, Edee. - Hi. Tim Harrison. - I'm Stella. - Hi, I'm Julia. This is our son, Nick. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. What are you guys doing out here? We drove in from Clarksville. We heard there were a bunch of caves out here that might be a good place to hole up for protection from what they say is coming. But we couldn't find any. We'd been out walking for hours. That's when we came upon y'all. So those candy wrappers were yours? Mm-hmm. You guys should join up with us. Where might that be? A place that's safe. Is there room for us? Yeah, you saved my life. Herbert's got this really cool farm. - You've been there before? - Lots of times. Herb's not answering. Come on. Come on, guys, we made it. Let's go. Herb! Oh my, God! Herbert! Herbert! Are you okay? What the hell happened? It takes more than a few looters to keep ol' Herbie down. Try not to talk, Herb. I thought you were dead. We had a car accident. Had to hike through the woods. We didn't get any cell reception. Well, you see, if your phone carrier used my satellites this wouldn't even be an issue. Yeah, okay. Well this is interesting. The two most important women in Tim's life together at last. - He never stops, does he? - No. For God sakes, who are these two? Sam Desser. This here's my daughter, Edee. The asteroid! The asteroid! How much time we got left on the clock? Less than two hours. Well, let's go! We gotta, we gotta follow it! Come on! Sam, help me get him up. Stay close. Easy, easy. You're okay, Herb. There. It's a hell of a lot nicer than the last time we were here. Yeah, well I figured if I spend any amount of time in here, it should have all the comforts of home. Easy. Easy now. Stella, see if you can find a first aid kit. I'll grab him some water. What can I do, Dad? See if you can get a TV, buddy. - Get some news. - Okay. Tim! Tim! I gotta get you up to speed on my project. Just try and relax right now, Herb. Let us take care of you first. Tim. Is Mission Control still in the same place? Uh-huh. It's really bad. Like, he might have internal bleeding, maybe broken ribs. Find him some food. A protein bar, some fruit. He needs to be alert. We might needs his help, okay? Okay. Hey, how is he? - I got him some water. - All right, good. Here you go. Oh, thanks. Mm-hmm. You all right? Just need some scotch and a little bit of ice, okay? Yeah, I could use some of that myself. What was that? Sam, we're 30 feet underground, okay? We're safe. How does he get fresh air down here? It's a filtration system vented to the outside. What? This place isn't big enough for all of us. Edee! Hey. Look at you sitting up. Want some food? Apple. This'll make you feel better. Come on, Herb. You gotta eat, babe. No? Dad, you might want to see this. We understand NASA plans to launch a nuclear missile at Triton. Actually, this is a joint operation in conjunction with all the military branches. And the chances of success? Well nothing's a hundred percent. What? But we're confident this detonation will be successful. They're actually gonna explode a nuclear warhead in space. Hundreds of times using computer models. It could easily fragment the asteroid and cause a multiple impact scenario. Are there any chances of nuclear fallout if something goes wrong? This government loves to show off its bombs. There's always that contingency, although highly unlikely, given the strike zone is outside the Earth's atmosphere. NEO Director, Clay Adams. Thank you for your time. What the hell was that? Just a meteorite landing close by. It's nothing to worry about. Let's just take a deep breath and remain calm. Julia. He's got an entire command center down here. With his money, what do you expect? Okay, we need a direct satellite feed so we can see what's going on versus what NASA wants to show us. - Wanna go play some pool? - Yeah. How long do you think we'll have to be in here? Two or three months. There's enough food to last us that long? Not as long as before. This place is really meant for five people. Having you and your dad here kinda changes things. What do you mean? We might have to ration food, and definitely water. Stella. Go get Tim. Okay. Tim. Herbert wants you. Nick, hey, Nick. Do you wanna just cool it with the balls, buddy? It's just getting a little annoying, okay. Okay. Gotcha, Dad. How are you doing, Herb? The bugs. The bugs? - What bugs? - Yeah, the bugs. I fixed 'em. My Impactor. What do you think I've been doin' up here for the past four years? So it works? Well, theoretically it does. I haven't tested it yet, but... I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. Tim, I'm in! Let's see. Ooh, you've got a fever. It's beautiful. I wonder how long it's been traveling through the universe. Millions, billions of years. Now we'll never know. Yes we will. We're gonna survive this, Julia. All of us. I'm saying that ever since your mother left us it's been me and you. We've taken care of each other, and we're gonna continue to do so. I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. But these are good people. We don't really know these people, Edee, and they don't really know us, okay? We don't know what they're gonna do when the food and the water runs out. We don't know that they might not throw us out. I'm not gonna take that chance. They won't do that. We don't know. Look, Edee, I just want to take care of you. We're gonna be okay. Trust me on this, all right? - Trust me. - I'm not doing it. Edee, you have to trust me. What's going on? Tim. We need to wake him up, I need his help. Okay. Herbert? Herbert? Here, hand me those smelling... Come on, Herb. You with us? No time for napping. - Sorry. - Oh, I don't know. I'm feeling kind of rough. I thought you said you were tough. Why don't you stop the whining? You're spunky. I like that. Herb, I've got a plan, but I need your help. All right, what are you thinking, Tim? Okay. This is Earth. Here is our asteroid. - We launch your Impactor into... - Oh, no, no, no. It won't work. The Impactor's not powerful enough to change the trajectory of the asteroid, which is way too big. I know. You're right. So we crash the Impactor into the densest Earth Trojan. Slingshot it into Triton, altering its trajectory. Right now all we have to do is nudge it. Yeah, and due to the distance, by the time it reaches Earth, it could possibly pass us by. It might just work. It has to work. Hey, we'll we've got 45 minutes until they launch a nuke, so we gotta do something. All right, I need to call NEO. Julia, you gotta find the right asteroid to crash the Impactor into. Herbert. Level with me. Is this gonna work? It's all we got. Oh, come on, answer the damn phone. I'll bring the Impactor online. Yeah, and relocate one of your satellites. We're gonna need eyes up there. You know, if we can pull this off, you'll really make a name for yourself. Yeah. And you'll redeem yours, too. - Hello? - I need to speak with Clay Adams. He's kind of busy right now. Well, this is kind of urgent. Who is this? This is Tim Harrison. Clay and I used to work together. We don't have much time. It's imperative you tell Clay to abort the launch. Abort the launch? I have a safer way to deflect Triton. He's not gonna wanna hear that, especially coming from you. Listen, just get him to call me. Clay knows the risks of sending a nuclear warhead into space, no matter what those generals tell him. Just get him to call me, he has my number. - How are we doing, Julia? - This takes time, Tim. That's something we don't have much of. I know. You don't have to remind me. Please tell me you're doing better, Herb. Uh, the Impactor's online. I relocated SATelle seven to view Region Nine, and that should be coming up just about now. Here's what we have to do. Once Julia's determined the correct asteroid, we set a collision course for Triton. Yeah, and then we uh, back time to establish when, we launch the Impactor for maximum kinetic impact. Exactly. It's not gonna work! This is crazy! Everybody out! Get away from there! Herbert, move! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sam! - Everybody outside, now! - Sam, calm down. - I am calm! - Let's go, move it! - Daddy! Get outside, Tim! - Daddy, what are you doing! - Edee! If you force them all outside they're going to die! A lot of people are gonna die, honey. But Nick and his family took us in! They didn't have to do that! We're the only family that matters right now, Edee. Just like always. Now you'll understand when you're older. - Stay away from me! - Edee! Sam? Sam, please, put the gun down. Outside! Sam! Listen to me. We can stop the impact from here. You need to give us that chance. It's not just about us. It's about the whole damn planet. No! It's about me and my daughter and enough food and air for us to survive! I'm sorry, you've gotta go outside! Get outside now! - Sam, I have to get that. - No. It's probably the guys from NEO calling me back. Don't touch that phone! Sam, I'm gonna get this phone. Don't touch it! Daddy! Ugh! Hold on. Damn it, Sam! Tie him up! Tie him to a chair or something! Gotcha. Come on. Here you go. Hey, Nick, we need a new monitor in here. We gotta have eyes, buddy. All right. Help me, Edee. Hello, Clay? What the hell is going on there, Tim? What do you want? Clay, you need to abort the launch. You know I can't do that. Then why did you call me back? Because secretly you're hoping you don't have to launch a nuke into outer space, that's why. Only the president can cancel the launch, and there are a lot of other people over my head. Clay, you and I both know that this is nearly as dangerous as the asteroid itself. All right. You tell me what you're thinking and I'll make that decision whether to make those calls or not. All right. Hear me out. Come on, Mr. Fix It, let's go, hurry up. Delay the launch? Are you out of your mind? Tim's plan could work. Look, Richard, you know we're not a 100 percent certain the nukes can destroy the asteroid. Just see if you can buy him some time. Clay, wasn't it you that fired this guy? Yes. And I was wrong. - Done. - Good job, son. I've got it. It's Perseid 715. According to VIRTIS it's one of the densest out there, - being an iron meteor. - Perfect. What are the Cartesian coordinates? Mr. President, do you trust me? I need thirty seconds, Sir. All right, it's show time. Julia, get me the projectile parameters. Diameter is 1,247 meters. Density, 3,000 kilograms per cubic meter. And the impact velocity? Fifty-one kilometers per second. Sixty-two degree impact angle. There's another news report on. You two keep doing what you're doing. Untie Sam, he's not a threat anymore. All right, we got some new information in from NASA just moments ago. Although there were rumors about canceling those nuclear missiles, - those were not true. - Damn it. NASA has no other contingency plan. Lift off will be in 17 minutes. Triton is... Are you all right? I'm sorry. - How are we looking? - Well it's gonna take six minutes for the Impactor to hit Perseid and another minutes for Perseid to hit Triton. Gives us minutes to change the trajectory of the asteroid. Well that's great, except the nukes launch in 17 minutes. We gotta go now and knock Triton off its course before they launch. Just pray that it works. Okay, I'm recalculating. Entering launch codes... now. The propulsion system's not responding. We've got 14 seconds. Have some faith, little brother. Eight seconds! Nick? Are you okay? Yeah. Three seconds! Tim! Light 'em up! Okay, let's get you up. - Nicky? Stay with your mom, okay? - Okay. It's working. It's gonna hit too late. There's not enough velocity. Nah, don't worry, kiddo. We'll just amp it up a little. We're blind. It destroyed your satellite. Well, there goes three hundred million dollars. I hope it was worth it. I'll punch up the radar screen. Triton will be in our mesosphere in six minutes, twenty seconds. You sure this was a good idea? No. But we didn't have a better one. Come on, Tim. Get this right. What's happening? That's Triton. Its- its projected path is red. And- and that's Perseid. Uh! The Impactor did it. Well, we won half the battle. Launch time is two minutes and counting. If Tim's plan works, you be ready to abort. I am. It's got 30 seconds to make contact before Triton enters our atmosphere. Come on, baby. Closer. Come on. Come on! Hit that giant son of a bitch! Abort! Abort! Cancel the launch! It did it. Oh, my God. It did it! Okay. I knew you'd do it, Tim. All right, let's go. Everybody up to the house. I need a scotch and I need it now. Let's go. Hello? Tim, you did it. Hello, Clay. I'm sorry I didn't trust you. A good algorithm never lies, Clay, I told you that. We're safe and that's all that matters. Tim, I want you back at NEO. If you'll have us. Let me get back to you on that. Good. I always knew that you were gonna save the world. Yeah, I'm a regular superhero. I almost ruined everything. It's okay, Dad. Brains and beauty. Hey, you know, I could use someone like you in my company. Is that a proposition? It's just a job offer, kid. Just, just a job. I'm so proud of you. We should all be proud of ourselves. We all did this. Thanks, Dad. Whoa. Nicky, look at this. Wow. Whoa. ♪♪
