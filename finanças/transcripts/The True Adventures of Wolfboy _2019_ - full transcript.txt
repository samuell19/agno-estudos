Are you listening to me? I want to go home. It's my birthday... I should decide what I get to do. No. You can't. You... Paul, you spend enough time alone at home as it is. - Paul, I just spent five dollars on this. - Hey, Paul. Is that you? How you doing, buddy? - You know these guys? - Yeah, we're his friends. Oh. Hey. - You're his dad, right? - Yeah. Huh. - So, how'd it feel? - How'd what feel? When you screwed that dog and made him. Tell me their names. They don't have names. Step right up... Uh... I was gonna give you this tonight, but instead... Step right up! Happy birthday. Open it. Do you like it? You like it? Hey, don't worry about those kids, okay? Just forget about 'em. You ready? Okay. - Okay, this is it. - Dad, I don't want... Dad, I don't want to do this. Now, what do you do when people make a comment? - Yeah, but you said... - What do you do? - Dig-Dignity. - Right, dignity. Show some dignity. Stand up straight, you speak loud, and... I can't make this clear enough... Paul, you don't run. Something happens, you get nervous, you stay right where you are... and you don't run. Okay? Now take off your mask. Great. Dignity. Right? Stand up straight. Get on line. You got this. I'll be strong. I'm a regular kid. I'm normal. - Regular kid. - Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. You got a ticket? So, how'd it feel? When you screwed that dog and made him? Paul! Paul! Where's your dad now, buddy? I'll bet he's back at the pound! He's probably fingering your mother before they put her to sleep! My mom's not a dog! - Yeah? You ever met her? - Shut up! Make me! Dog! Why don't you bark for us? Go on, bark! You heard him! - Bark! - Bark for us, boy! He said bark! - Bark! - Only thing you're good at! Bark, you idiot! Come on, we know you can do it! Spit it out! Bark, dog! I'm gonna go to my room. Look, I know you had a rough day, but I really want to show you something. Every child is like a beautiful musical note. It's just that some notes are more unique than other notes. What we like to do is take those musical notes and put them together and make a song. And we call that song Bishop Griffin. Here at Bishop Griffin, we believe that a well-rounded education comes from... embracing the differences of those around us while creating a safe, inclusive environment to learn, play and grow. Oh! Nice shot there, Byron. Every child has a right to be educated. Every child has a right to be respected. Every child has a right to be loved. Nice work there, buddy. - Who's that? - Um, Iron Man. That's exactly what I thought. A griffin is not a lion nor eagle. A griffin is something else entirely. At Bishop Griffin's, we take inspiration from the griffin. And together we teach one another how to fly. Okay. What do you think? I think that if you send me to this school, I will burn it to the ground. Yeah, right. Okay, I have one last birthday present for you. Check this out. Try it on. Give it a shot. Paul. "To Paul, from Mom." Do you know where this came from? Wow. Wow, look at you. You look great. Look out, ladies. James Bond over here. You don't know where this came from? Oh, that? Yeah, that, uh, came this afternoon. What was in it? Nothing. I can't get over how great you look. - You look... - I look like a Build-A-Bear. No, you don't. Yeah, I got a good feeling about this school. I got a good... I got a good feeling. It's gonna be a terrific opportunity for you to meet people like you. I don't want to meet people like me. Why not? Because I hate me. I, uh, I don't know what to tell you, Paul. All right, what do you want me to do? I don't know what to do. I-I can't get you to stick up for yourself. I can't get you to meet friends. I can't get you to take off that stupid mask. What do you want me to do? Help me out. Mom wouldn't make me go to this school. What? - Mom... - Mom? Yeah, well, if she cared so much about you, why'd she leave? I'm sorry. Paul, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, okay? - I didn't mean that. Come on, let's eat. - Don't touch me. Paul, I said I was sor... Ow! You just bit me! Paul? Paul, open up. Come on. Come on, pal. I'm sorry, okay? I said I was sorry. I don't want to talk about her anymore, okay? I'm sorry I said that, but... ...I don't want to talk about her, and I don't think you should think about her. Paul, please open the door? There are some... There are some things that I've always wanted to ask you. You were there when I was born, obviously. And then you ran away. Was it easy? Did it hurt?

Just... be yourself. So what do you say? Do we have ourselves a deal? Hi. Detective Pollok. We spoke? So take me through what happened again. Uh... Oh, uh, I told you we had an argument, and, uh... And he bit me. - He bit you? - Yeah. And then he left. Oh, uh, that's his hair. Sorry. Uh, it's just all over. It's... not a big deal. Excuse me. Does he bite you often? No. No, he doesn't. But he's got a temper. He was angry? No, he's a good kid. But he bit you? Do you want to see his room? Do you have any current photos? No, I don't. He, uh... he doesn't like his... picture taken.

I see no reason why we should terminate our working relationship. Do you? - The money. - Patience, boy. This is not a one-shot deal. We're just getting started. Why don't you hop on this sucker? - Give it a spin. - Yeah. - Come on. Join the family. Let's ride! Come on, boy with no name! Have some fun! Come on! Let your hair down! Ha-ha! God, yes!

Violence! No. No! Save the Dragon! Don't let it get to the Dragon! Put out the fire! My God, no! Oh, no! Did you ever wonder about who I was? About what I was capable of? Or did you just want to get as far away as possible? Before I ruined your life, too. Or did I mean anything to you at all? Okay. - Hello? - Hey, it's Detective Pollok. - Have some news about your son. - Is he okay? He apparently burned down a carnival. Does he have any past experience with arson? No, no, h-he doesn't have any experience with that. I'm just gonna tell you... now that I know he's a potential threat... What do you mean? He's not a potential threat. He's a 13-year-old boy. 13-year-olds can do terrible things. Look, I'll be in touch, okay? Uh-huh. Okay.

Yeah, or that she did it herself because she was tired of people calling her pretty, or that... Huh. Come on. So, by my estimations, we should be in Pennsylvania in like, I don't know, three hours? Depending on traffic? Do you think we could stop - at a gas station first? - Why? I just smashed my mom's head in with a piece of wood last night, and I'd really like to make some purchases - to take my mind off of it. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. That reminds me.

Really? Uh, am I going to jail, or...? Let's take that one step at a time. Where is he? Paul. You don't run. When you get nervous, you don't run. How many times do we have to go over this? I'll give you a minute. I'm sorry. No, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forget the school, okay? Forget the school. It was a stupid idea. Okay? Yeah. I'm trying, pal. I'm trying as hard as I can. - I know. I'm trying, too. - Yeah. I know you are. Where's your mask? - I lost it. - Okay. That's okay. It doesn't matter. We'll get you a new one. I was thinking maybe... maybe it'd be easier - if I wore one, too, so we... - No. No, Dad, it's... it's fine. Okay. Wow. You went to go find your mom. - How'd you know that? - That... it doesn't matter. You still want to find her? You told me you didn't know where she lived. - Okay. - This is it? Yeah. Have you ever been in there? No. No. I mean, I've been through her, uh, garbage a few times. Not in, like, a creepy sense but in a professional way. It's funny, I always thought she lived in, like... Paris or something. Paris. Nope. Are you sure you don't want me to go in there with you? No. I'm okay. Okay. Paul, wait. I don't know what it's gonna be like in there, okay, so I don't think you should expect it go great. I know, Dad. And the last thing to ask, I guess... ...did you ever wonder if I would find you? Hi. Hello. I can get you, um, some water, or, like, um... Water? I always thought you lived in a mansion, with kids who played the flute or the cello. Did you want me to have a nice house so you could come and stay with me? No, it just made it easier to dislike you. Um, sorry to disappoint. I don't have a flute. I have a recorder, I think. Do you want it? Okay. I think it's somewhere over here. Yeah. Happy birthday. You remembered. Yeah. I don't know how to play this. Here. Want to show you. Just, um, put your fingers over these holes like this. You're really bad at that. Yeah, let's be honest, these things... sound like shit no matter what, so... Damn it, I was trying not to swear. I'm sorry. It's just... It was me. I never told your dad, but... ...this is pretty much all my fault. What do you mean? Dad? Who's that? - It's me. - Sleeping. Remember the person I told you about last night? He's here. Well, would you look at that. Jen, uh, you mind leaving us alone for a bit? You know, I was awful angry when she told me about you. If I had known before, I-I would've... I mean, I didn't even know she had a kid. You didn't know about me? She's always been very, uh... It was hard for her, growing up with me. Used to lie and say that her dad was the guy who hosted "Wheel of Fortune." Yeah, she pretty much cut me out of her life for something like 25 years. When did she start talking to you again? Uh, about 13 years ago. - Hmm. - And, you know, it's... it's really easy to blame anyone for anything. But when you get to be my age, it all just seems sort of... So, what kind of names have they called you? - What do you mean? - Come on. I want to see if they've gotten any more creative since I was a kid. Dogface. You ever get Dogface? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, that's a staple. - How about Furball? - Mm-hmm, yeah. Um, uh, Hairy Potter. - You mean, l-like the... - Yeah. With an "I," yeah. Hey, that ain't half bad. You ever try to cut it off? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - But it came back, right? - Yeah, twice as thick, yeah. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Once, I tried to set it on fire. - Really? - Yeah, I got too scared at the last second. But I still managed to burn down a shed. Wow. I tried Nair. This is a weird question, but... How hard is it? What do you mean? I mean... ...how hard will it be? I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be tough. You got any friends? - Yeah. - Well, then, you're a heck of a lot further along then I was. I mean, when I was your age, I was still wearing a sack over my head. So, no, it's never gonna be truly easy. But I guess I'd just say this: the world is gonna be mean to us no matter what we do. So we can't afford to be mean to ourselves. You know, your mom's got this, uh, art studio thing. She'd been working on this project for quite a while. I always thought that it was connected to me. But now I don't think that anymore. You guys have a good conversation? Yeah. Did he say anything bad about me? - Uh... - He can. He should, because... I know how he feels about me, and he's not wrong. But when I first saw your face and I knew what your life was gonna be like, I just... I couldn't. I couldn't do that. If you want to be angry at me, it's okay. If I were you, I'd be angry. - Do you want me to yell at you, or something? - Yes. No. I don't know. Maybe. I had all these questions for you. You're a good artist. You're really good at drawing. - Well, can I give you a hug? - No. Can I take the recorder home? Yeah. Thank you. Hey. Oh, look at that... a dust bunny. Can you...? Do you think we could go talk? Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry about what I said, and I was just... It's fine. I'm over it. You don't have to pretend. I'm not pretending. You think I'm not used to people being terrible to me? Think you're special? Aristiana... I mean, chances are, 20 years from now, I'll either be an alcoholic or beaten to death. Come on, I got something to show you. You know, I... I meant what I said. I'm really sorry. So, how are things with your mom? I'm staying with my aunt for a while. You know, it's not perfect, but... it's getting better. I met my mom today. Really? Yeah. How was it? It was... ...really weird. I don't know... I'm sorry, Paul. Can I tell you something? Yeah. I'm pretty sure you're the most amazing girl I've ever met. Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty sure I am, too. You think we'll still be friends in 20 years? In 20 years, I think the whole world might be underwater. But, uh... yeah.
