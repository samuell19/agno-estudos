(slow brass music) - [Vilmos] Martin. (raps on glass) - Say goodbye to Vilmos. - You send me letter, yes? - Well, we're only going for a couple weeks. - You be good boy to your mother. (Elise groans) I, I make you lunch. (dog barking) - [Radio Announcer] With the arrival of the Chinese delegation for their meeting with President Carter. In sports, the 1979 World Series starts in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. - What do you think of Vilmos? - Well it's only been a year. - (sighs) I thought I could make us a life out here, like normal Americans. Almost learned to cook meatloaf. - Are you leaving Vilmos? - Well, it looks that way. - And where do we go this time? - I don't know, pick a place. - No, mom, I'm serious. We keep moving around-- - Yeah, and we always land on our feet. Well, don't we? - What about New York? I'd like to see my dad. My real one. - New York, I can arrange. As for the other. - What's he like? - Don't remember. 15 years is a long time, okay? ♪ Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound ♪ Do me up, angel. - Going out? - Yeah. I wanna scribble a little something. - A poem? - How do you know about that? You weren't even born when I used to write poetry. - Write in here. - You afraid of the dark? Okay. So, won't be late. (rock music) (horn honks) - [Man] Any time, lady. (horn honks) (rock music) (traffic whooshing) (jukebox clangs) - Well that's the end of that dime. Anything special you'd like to hear? - [Elise] Silence would be heaven. - All right. I got regular note-jottin' paper if you want. - [Elise] How 'bout a stamp? - That's a letter? - It might be. Who knows? My surrender. My peace offering to a man I used to know. Una mas, s'il vous plait. - I live out back if you'd like a cup of coffee. - What I'd like is a drink and a stamp. - Sorry, ma'am. Gotta close up. State law. - You married? - You uh, you come right out with it, don't you? I was. - Do you miss her? - My name's Jason. - How about that other dime, Jason? - Yes, ma'am. (slow soulful music) - Oh dear, why is this part always so easy? I bet you're a very nice man. How about we just say goodnight, huh? (slow soulful music) ♪ Dee, dee, dee ♪ La-di-dah ♪ Dee, dee, dee, dee. - Dear Andrew. - Martin are my slippers in there? My slippers? - [Martin] What? - Handsome man. Break some poor woman's heart someday. (horns honking) Used to be parking around here somewhere. - Are we just gonna sit here? - Well we might! Have you got a better idea? - Sorry. (horn honking) (baby crying) (upbeat music) (horn honking) (upbeat music) - Oh, Elise! - Emma! (yelling) - My god! Oh my god! (laughs) I don't believe it's you! (laughing) God, come over here, look at you, look at you! (laughing) You are beautiful as ever! - Oh, Em! - And lean! - Mom, what do you want me to do with the stuff in the car? - What's wrong? - His voice, it's exactly like-- - Darling, do you remember Emma? - What? It was such a long time ago, you were a tiny little thing, smaller than me, even. - [Elise] Say hello! - Who's my voice exactly like? - The Man in the Moon, now come on, say hello, let's unpack the car. Oh Emma, I'm back! - So what was it like, the Wild West? Did you meet Roy Rogers? - He was otherwise engaged. - Oh, like our president. (laughing) - Cecil, we agreed, no politics, not tonight. - My little tyrant. You know, I'm more afraid of her than I am of immigration. - He thinks it's a big joke. They open his mail, he hears clicks on his phone. They still think he'll lead them to the Weather Underground. - Can you believe it's still going on? - And it always will, my dear. We stopped Vietnam, not the people that made it happen. - Oh, that's enough, it's too depressing. - No, no, more, more. I've been away for so long it's like a breath of fresh air. Come on, talk, argue, debate, huh? - Debate, mm. - Ah. Yes. (singing in foreign language) - Wait a minute, is that coffee? - Don't you think? - My darling conscience. How did I manage all these years without you? - I don't know. When I heard Martin's voice, oh, it's eerie. - I know. He opens his mouth and he's Andrew more every day. His behavior, too: judgments, disapproving looks. - Drink up. I'll take tomorrow off, we'll hang out. - Hang out? Do people still hang out? - [Emma] Yes. - Emma. Why don't we throw a party? Let people know I'm back. - [Emma] People? - Yeah, the old gang. Anyone who might have an interest in my return. - Don't worry, word'll get around. Since when did you ever arrive anywhere unnoticed, huh? - Do you think it's still true? (sirens wailing) - Are you famous? (laughs) - Important people pretend to read my work sometimes. So yes, yes, in a small way. Vino? - Oh no, no, I don't think I'm allowed. - Nonsense, what are you, 15? - Almost 16. - In India you'd have been married years ago. In China, you'd have children of your own by now. Come over here, come on, play some chess. (sirens wailing) - Do you know my father? - White goes first. - Do I sound like him? Do I look like him? - Which hand? - What happened to my father? - Money. - Money? - Took him away, kept him away. He was a slave to ambition and a prisoner of success. - I don't understand. - Nor should you. You're not remotely like him. Let's hope. Here, you play white. (upbeat piano music) - The first month is rent free in return for the paint job, I sold the Caddy, plus with my starting salary from Maison de Maurice, and believe me, I'm not gonna be a mere pattern cutter for long, no way. Maurice can spot talent. So, next week we start your college fund. Angel, I'm talking to you. - Oh, I'm painting, I have to concentrate. - What's the matter, Moody Morris? Turn the key, open the lid, look where all the secrets are hid. - When are we gonna see Andrew? - So that's it. - We've been here almost two months, why can't you call him? - One has one's pride. Where are you going? - I need more paint. - Angel, I will call him. I just need to make up my mind to, that's all. Just give me some time, okay? (singing in foreign language) Hey Senor, you are new in town, yes? - No, mom, I'm painting. - Oh, we have forever to paint, but only tonight for dancing! - When are you going to call him? - We have each other, who else do we need? (upbeat Spanish music) (upbeat piano music) - [Martin] Oh, I'm sorry. - So what am I, invisible? (upbeat piano music) - Big smile, that's beautiful. You love it, you love those clothes, you love the way she looks, she loves the way you look. That's it, try to get the leg a little, that's right, everything's up, everybody's smiling, it's oh so much fun. It's winter, it's snowing, spin it again with a little more exaggeration. That's it. Spin it again, that's it. - [Man] Yeah. Move this little light around here. (people chattering) - [Man] Lay it in, that's why we. (overlapping chatter) - Okay, can you give me-- - [Woman] Okay, let me catch this over here, hold on one second. - Are you just gonna stand there? - What? - You're late, you gotta get dressed he's gonna need you in 10 minutes. (overlapping chattering) - [Woman] Bob, you gotta check your light. - [Andrew] That's right, head back. - [Woman] Here honey, take this with you. - [Andrew] Move this little light around here. - [Woman] Yeah, I got you, go more lower-- - [Man] Garcia, you wanna step over here, please? - [Andrew] Okay, can you give me. - [Woman] It, it's okay, yeah. - [Man] Isabelle, do you want anything? - [Woman] No really, trust me, leave it. (overlapping chattering) (upbeat music) - Heads back, chins up. Everybody's up, everybody's happy. I need a, I need a much, much more exaggerated, much more generous, with the spirit. It's, it's a wonderful time of year, it's winter, it's snowing, everybody's happy. Gorgeous, gorgeous with the chin back. Okay, show me the clothes, I need the clothes, we gotta see the clothes, we're trying to sell the clothes. Okay, gimme that, let's go back through that, let's go back to that take again, a lot fuller, a lot more exaggeration, a very happy time of year, you're very, you're up. The, the boy, don't, don't look at me, look at the camera, okay, look into, why are you looking at me, do you hear me? Are you okay? Are you with us? What's, who's the boy? (scoffs) I can't work with this. Come on, let's get somebody else in here right away. Um, call the agency and give them his name. They shouldn't be sending them out. Okay, everybody, let's get back into it, let's not lose that energy, give me that exaggeration, give me that love, you love these clothes, that's it, give me that smile, Phoebe, come on. Get that chin up. Chin up, look at her, look at him, you love him, she loves you, it's a beautiful, wonderful thing. You've been really sensational today, okay? See you next Thursday, all right? - [Model] Thank you, Andrew! Ciao! - Who are you? - You don't recognize me? - Why, should I? - We're in the city now. Me and mom. - You and... Martin? Well I'm glad somebody bothered to tell me. Did she send you to make contact, couldn't do it herself? - I guess I should have called first. - Not a bad idea, after 15 years. - I wrote to you. - Twice, with no return address. - We moved around a lot. - Look, I'm sorry, I... this is so damned unexpected, I don't know what to say. - Is it okay I'm here? - Look at you, all grown up. - Mom says hello. - Yeah, I'll bet she does. - Could I see you sometime? (somber piano music) - Did she send you? Does she know you're here? - No. - (sighs) Yeah. Yeah, sure. Only call first. I don't like surprises. (swelling jazz music) You got big. 15 years. Hmph. Look at you. (slow piano music) (sewing machines clattering) (people chattering) - Elise, you got a phone call. - Hello? Yes, that's me. What? No, I'm sorry, there must be some mistake. I don't know what you're talking about, he's not a truant. Yes, okay, I'll talk to him. Thank you, bye. - Elise, my love, you can't afford these distractions. You need to focus if you want a career. - I'm sorry, Maurice, but my son comes first, always. - You have talent, show me you're serious, I'll help you. If you're not, don't waste my time. (people chattering) (funky music) - [Lew] Elise, come on back. - Sorry, Lew, I lost track of the time. - [Lew] The night is young! (funky music) (sirens wailing faintly) - Where have you been? - At the library. - You know we always eat at seven. - We do? - Yes, I've been waiting for you. - At the bar? - What bar? - Around the corner, I saw you. - All right, I was having a drink, and why? Because today I had a very alarming call from your school. Where have you been the past two weeks? - In class. - Martin, I want the truth. - School is boring. I, I know all the stuff they're teaching. - You couldn't tell me that? - I'm sorry, mom. - I want a decent life for you, a normal life. Why do you think I work so hard? - Maybe Andrew could help us out. - He wants no part of this family. - How can he want a part of us when he didn't even know we were back? - What do you mean he didn't... wait a minute. Have you called Andrew? Is that where you go when you miss school? Have you talked to him? - Mom, take it easy. - I'm so sorry, angel. Of course you'd have told me, I'm sorry. No secrets. Not between the two of us. - Why do you hate him so much? (somber music) - We were young, it was a very passionate time. We thought if we could actually stop Vietnam, if people like us could make such a difference, oh God, power to the people. We were so naive. But we believed it with all our hearts. At least some of us did, not all. A couple of us turned out to be. - What? - It was a long time ago. I don't hate your father. But certain old wounds, even when they seem healed, they're still painful to the touch. - I'm sorry about school, mom, I'm gonna try harder. - It was a mistake coming back to this town. - I like it here. - New York is no place for a growing child. You need open skies, mountains, country-- - No, I hate mountains and countryside. - Listen to me for one minute. Cecil knows a school upstate, it's very forward-looking, very innovative-- - No, I won't go! - Just until my job is secure. When I can afford a decent life for us, you'll come back home and-- - And you'll find another excuse for us to move - I can't be everything and then another, and then - I oughta be right now, - my hands are full! - Well then call Andrew! - No, never! I'm not gonna beg. You go away to school, it's settled, final. (somber music) - Fine. - Trees, flowers, nature. (sighs) Ah, to look out a window and see all this. Imagine! Oh, look, look, look, look, look at those men over there in the fields, look at how big they are. You never see people that big in the city. They're enormous. Just gonna close my window. Bugs. (light flute music) - [Man] Come on, come on, let's go! - Over here, over here! - [Boy] I'm open! - [Boy] Hey, hey! (light flute music) - [Boy] I'm open! - [Boys] Whoa! (laughs) - [Boy] Over here! - Watch him, get him! - Get him! - Cover him! - Over here! (boys grunting) - He's a quick learner, we've always moved around a lot. - Why don't you sit down, please? (boys yelling faintly) Let me be frank. Many students sent away from home to school, even the most secure homes, have a feeling of rejection, you know. Like punishment for doing something wrong. If there are any family irregularities, we need to know about them now so we can anticipate the problems before they arise. - My son and I enjoy a close, secure relationship. - Under father you left a blank. Does this mean something? - Means his father is a blank. It's spartan. Could use a few prints on the walls. Here, I'll help you. - Mom, I know how to make a bed. - You haven't left enough blanket at the bottom. - I left plenty of blanket-- - No, it's right here-- - Mom, will you! (somber dramatic music) - Try to understand, angel. Please. (somber dramatic music) (children chattering) (somber soulful music) I'm out of mind, how am I gonna pay for that school? - [Emma] Why'd you send him there in the first place? - The city's too full of broken promises. - You're afraid he'll see Andrew. - Afraid? I'd be delighted if he took some interest in his son. - His son's mother, you mean. - Oh, I've long ago abandoned all hope in that area. - (scoffs) Nonsense. - You're wrong, Emma. I don't miss the past. I miss arguing through the night, the farm, rallies, Angela Davis, the night she stayed with us, you remember? I miss that wonderful closeness we all had. - Wasn't that mainly a housing problem? - Oh, you know what I mean. - You miss the romance, not the struggle. That goes on, with or without you dreamers. - You still believe, don't you, Emma? Here's to my promotion, a real job. And if Martin does well, a scholarship was mentioned. If I can just hang on for six months. Prosit! Mm. - Here's my balance. Make it out for whatever you need. - Darling Emma. We'll always be together, won't we? Eat and dance and grow old together. On the front lines in sweat socks and tennis shoes, offering a good time to any soldier who lay down his gun and burn his uniform. (laughing) - Take this, here. (laughs) Has it ever crossed your mind that Andrew might still feel something for you, too? - Shh. That's a dream you shouldn't say out loud. It's bad luck. - People don't get over you, Elise. (somber soulful music) - Toots, penny for your thoughts? - Nothing. - In other words, mind your own business. - Not important. - There's this wonderful invention called the telephone. You put your finger on little buttons and poke. Call him, toots. - Call who? - You are more transparent than you think, Andy Panda. You have his number, he lives less than 10 blocks away. - Who told you that? - I was in the next room when you called information. - Oh, I have a spy in my house. - He came to the studio, that took guts. You could meet him halfway. - This subject is off-limits, okay, Penny? - You afraid she might answer the phone? - That's enough, Penny! - You left that woman 15 years ago. My God, what did she do to you? - This discussion is over, do you understand? For good! (dramatic music) (somber soulful music) (phone ringing) - [Man] Hi, Elise. How you doing? (horn blares) (somber soulful music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Penny? Look, honey, I'm sorry I yelled, I was... Who is this? (people speaking faintly) - No one, father. - Lunch time, let's move it everybody, come on! (children yelling) - Move it! (children chattering) - [Martin] Can I have the ball? - It's lunch time. - No, I'm not hungry, I wanna practice. - Practice? Thought you wanted to fail and be sent home? - May I please have the basketball? - Ah, so you're calling attention to yourself. Skipping lunch in full view of the dining room, brooding. - What's your problem? - The problem is yours, Martin. Whoever it is you're trying to impress is not in the dining room, is he? - No, I'm not trying to impress anyone. - Then fail. (somber soulful music) - All right guys, turn 'em out. Turn out the lights, lights out. (boys chattering) Lights out. Turn out the light, guys. Lights out. You okay? Martin? (dramatic soulful music) (children chattering faintly) - Why did you run away? - I don't know. - Do you have any idea what it costs me to send you here, and I, I don't mean money. - I'm sorry. - Martin, I can't take care of you in the city. I work 14 hours a day. I can barely look after myself. - Okay. - Martin, look at me. Both of us have to make this work. - Yes. - Why are you so distant with me? - I knew if you could have me at home, you would. I'll try harder, I promise. - Darling. No one is going to help us. Accept it. (phone rings) - Hello? Martin, is this you? - I just thought I'd say hi. - Yeah, well uh, I've got some static on this line, hang up and I'll call you right back, okay? - No, I'm not at home. I'm upstate, Unity International, it's this school. - Whose idea was that? - Me and mom. We thought I'd be better off out of town. - Is that what you want? - Look, I'm calling because I ran away from here. - Where'd you go? - I was going back to the city. Try to see you. - Can I borrow your razor, toots? - Andrew? - Yeah, yeah, I'm here. - Would you ever come up, visit me? - Anything can happen. - Parents' Day, maybe. - How are your grades? - Oh, they don't have grades here. They don't believe in the competitive system. - Oh, oh, okay. - Will you come? - I'll tell you what, I'll, I'll pencil it in, and if I'm not up against it that weekend, we'll see. - Great. Bye. (children yelling faintly) - Martin, let's go man, it's Saturday. - [Boy] Time to play, man, no time for work, man. You gotta forget this stuff, man. - No, no, no, I can't. - Come on, basketball, man. - No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry guys, I can't. (boys scoff) (boys yelling faintly) - I have your teachers' evaluation here. You've been buckling down, haven't you? How would you like to go to Switzerland? - What? - You have an aptitude for languages. We are sending three students there next year on exchange. We would like you to be one of them. (upbeat music) - Switzerland? Oh darling, I'm so proud of you. - When exactly is Parents' Day? - What do you mean, will I be there? Your own mother? - Is Elise coming? - For you, yes, I will wear the red dress. - Does she know that you're inviting me? - Yes, yes, yes, I'll do my hair. I'll fix it myself. Don't worry, I shall not disappoint. - I'll try, but no promises, all right? - My son is a genius, straight-A student, popular, gorgeous, charming. And all thanks to me and me alone. I'm gonna sit in the front row, looking my ravishing best. - Oozing modesty. - Just in case a certain someone still thinks I couldn't do it without him. Emma, do you think I'm too proud? - I think you have an extraordinary heart. - Which reminds me. Your loan. Paid in full. To Parents' Day. To parents, to children, to lovers, to dreams. - Elise, um, Cecil is holding our table. - Broke my heart to send Martin away. - I know. - I've given myself completely to very few men. Martin is the last. - He's hardly a man. - He had no time for childhood. I had to make him strong, strong like me. - It is up to us, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to break this conspiracy of silence. To demand a worldwide exchange of scientists, students, of artists, of all working men and women, us, U.S., us. (applauding and cheering) - [Girl] Right on, Martin! - [Boy] Yeah! - Your mother didn't make it. - Obviously. - What is that supposed to mean? - Well it means she wasn't there so obviously she didn't make it. You hated my speech. - [Andrew] Is that what's bugging you? - Well I worked hard on it. - Bull. - What? - It was horse manure, just like everything else about that place. Great fantasy for radical has-beens. - Says who? - Oh, I know that crowd. 15 years ago it was, uh, give peace a chance, we shall overcome, hell, nothing but a big party. Change the world, they were afraid of it. They still are. The minute they get a chance, they send their kids as far away from reality as they possibly can. They never grew up, that's their problem. - I didn't write that speech. - What? - I, I, I cribbed it from a magazine in the school library. - Why? - I didn't know what to say. They go for that kind of stuff up here. - Eh. I used to write speeches. Long live Fidel. Off the pigs. Had no idea what I was talking about, I did it because I wanted to be a part of what was going on. To belong. - I'm sorry Andrew, I won't do it again. - Hey, why don't we drop the Andrew, all right? I'm your, I'm your father. Try dad, okay? Hey. - [Man] How ya doing? - Everything set? - [Man] All fueled up, sir. - Good. - Nice sky up there today. (planes whirring) - Where we going? Dad? - Come on, come on. - This is yours? - Rented. Close the door. (blades whir) Put your headphones on. - [Air Controller] Uh 47, copy, you're cleared for takeoff, zero seven. - 47, pilot is cleared for takeoff, zero seven. All right, here's your throttle, in for fast, out for slow. Speed indicator. When this gets to 80, pull back on your yolk, then you're upstairs, got it? - Got it. - All right, take her up. - You can't be serious. - Do it. - I don't know how to fly. - Look, come on, you can give it a try or worry 'til you're too afraid to make a move. Make up your mind. - You'll have the other controls? - You're on your own, kid. - Go, go over it with, with me one more time. - Let's do it. (upbeat piano music) - Did you say 80, dad? (breathing heavily) (laughs) I did it, I did it! Whoo! (laughs) Yes! (cheers) I did it! - Okay, this is it. This is where I live. Oh, these are some of my photographs, if you have any interest in that kind of thing. - How was Parents' Day? Surprise! - Oh, hi, Penny. Penny, this is my son, Martin, and uh, Martin, this is Penny, my friend. - Hi. - Hi. Hope you don't mind, I thought I'd be here to welcome you back. - No, not at all. - Goody, Chinese, I'm ravenous. - Okay, just put your stuff down anywhere and make yourself at home. I've got a few phone calls I gotta make. - I've heard lots about you. Can't wait to get to know you. - Oh, wow. - So. Been looking forward to this. - Why? - Isn't it natural under the circumstances? - Are you in love with my father? - Oh goody, small talk, my favorite kind. - Are you? - You're pretty intense, aren't you? I mean nice, but intense. - Hey, how you guys doing? - Great, great. - Good. - Well? - Well what? - Do you love him? - It's none of your business. He keeps it simple. And simple's what I want right now, just pure, wholesome fun, no strings. This is hardly the conversation I imagined having with my boyfriend's son. - Boy? He's old enough to be your father. - Are we getting along or not? (laughs) - Are we supposed to? - That. Maybe this. No. Oh yes, but cut it on the bias. Forget the tweed, I hate tweed. What is going on here? I need those patterns yesterday. Who did these sketches? - Do you mind? - Since when do you do renderings, you're a cutter. - Someone has to make sense of your sketches or we'd all be on welfare. Your assistant doesn't understand your ideas. I redo all of her work. And when I try to save your butt you threaten to fire me for wanting one weekend off, the most important weekend of my life. (breathes heavily) Never mind. - How long did these take you? - Less than an hour. - Come to my office, I want to show you some ideas. - I'm a pattern cutter. If you want renderings, we might discuss it in the morning. - 9:00 a.m. - 10, if I can leave right now. My son is home, I've earned some time with him, don't you agree? - It's lucky you have talent. - For both of us, Maurice. (relaxed jazz music) - So, is he coming to the party? - Penny! - What party? - Uh, it's nothing. It's just my annual shindig, it's no big deal. - Father's Day, to be exact. - Penelope. - Penny, I hate Penelope. - Of course, if you happen to be free that weekend. - He wants his friends to meet you. It's all in your honor, kiddo. You don't show, it's Easter without the bunny. - Just eat, Penny. - It's okay, dad. It's very nice of you, I appreciate it. - Where's the duck, I ordered duck. - Quack quack. You'll love the house. Private beach and swimming pool, everything deluxe. - Yeah, I have this job upstate. If I can get the time off, you know? - Try real hard. He will never tell you how much it means to him so I will. It means a whole lot. - Could I bring someone? - [Andrew] Friend? - A date. - Sure, there's plenty of room, you could stay the weekend. So you have a girlfriend, huh, what's her name? - I think you'll like her. - Do you see how easy this is? He's coming, everyone's happy, no problem! (light switch clicks) - Mom? (sirens wailing) ♪ Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound ♪ Angel! - Mom! - Have you been here long? - No. - Oh my God, those stairs. Legs are killing me. - Mom, why, why is there no-- - No, wait a minute, wait a minute, first things first. Tell me all about today. How did the speech go? Who was there, did everybody applaud? - Mom, why the candles? Why is the fridge empty? - Oh, the electric people, honestly. They're children, so impatient. - We've been disconnected? - Well, it was either that or the phone. And since nothing interesting ever entered my life through the Frigidaire, I chose to pay the phone bill. - And this is how you've been living? - What's wrong with the way I've been living? Is that what I pay them to teach you at that school, to be a snob, to criticize your own flesh and blood? - Mom, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. - No angel, I'm sorry, it's me. I'm sorry. They've just been working us past exhaustion. Honey, will you uh, rub my feet? Oh! Thank you, angel. I'm sorry I couldn't be there today. My angel, my genius. My little ambassador to Switzerland. Oh, that feels good. - Things are going to be better, mom. - Mm. - [Martin] Maybe real soon. - Gosh, I almost forgot! Voila! - What's that? - Have I been working hard for nothing? Go on, open it, silly. - The QE II? - We'll tour Europe together. I'll drop you off in Zurich and then catch a flight home. - It sails next weekend. - I said to Maurice, you've had your pound of flesh, I get three weeks off with pay, or find yourself some new help. Shall we celebrate? - Mom. - Mm-hm? - We can't go. - Oh, I know. Isn't it extravagant? - You can't, you can't, you can't even pay the electricity bill. - Eh, details, details. - I'm not on full scholarship in Switzerland, we're gonna have tuition to pay. - Yes, I know, and I just got a raise. - We're not going! - I beg your pardon? - We have to be in the city. - We do? - There's a party for me, a going-away party. - And that ranks above a trip to Europe? - My friends want to meet you, mom. You were supposed to be there today, you can't let me down again. - That comment is unworthy of you. - A trip like this takes planning. We'll turn in the tickets and then next summer, next summer when I'm done with school and you've saved up some money, then we'll all celebrate with a trip to Zurich. - What do you mean, all? What, who's all? - You and me. - Martin, look at me. What's going on? - Nothing. - You've seen him. (somber soulful music) When? - At school. (gasps) - Well, the fog lifts. - I just, I, I thought if, if you were both there, I read the speech and you were all dressed up the way you do sometimes. - He'd see what he was missing and have us back. Dreamer. (somber soulful music) (sirens wailing) - He keeps your picture beside his bed. - Picture, what picture? - That farm place. The commune? - Are you making this up? Has he ever mentioned my name? - Well, he thinks about you. - How do you know? - He's my father, I can tell. - We're too much alike, you and I. Pipe dreams. Look, I'm glad he wants to spend time with you. A boy your age needs a father but promise, promise me you won't hide anything from me again. - Okay. - Come on, undo me. Did he get heavy? He was always battling the bulge. - Women find him attractive. - Women find him attractive. Is he seeing someone? - Oh, she's just a kid. - Bastard. - Mom. - What do you do together, you and your father, and this kid? - It's Andrew's party. - Andrew's? - I told him I was bringing a date. - Oh Martin, no, how could you! - I, I, I must be nuts. - What, did you expect me to just go blundering back into his life unprepared? Embarrass myself in front of all his friends? - Never mind, okay, just never mind then. I guess it was a stupid idea, I wasn't thinking. (sirens wailing) - Is it a big party? - I don't know. - Used to make quite an impression when I entered a room. I stood perfectly still, everything moved in my direction. - You still do, mom. - Mr. Tongue-Of-Velvet. God, what am I thinking about? - May I go? - On your own? - Well why should I give up on him just because you did? - But you said he was expecting you to bring a date. What are you gonna tell him? - Mom? - Be quite a scene, wouldn't it? The two of us waltzing in, arm-in-arm. - You'll come? - We should call and warn him, it's only fair. But on the other hand, in love and war, et cetera. - You'll get all fixed up. - I shall not disappoint. What a pair we are, you and I. (upbeat romantic music) (upbeat music) - Hi! (laughs) Oh, there you are! Hi, hi! (people chattering) - So, where's your mystery date? - Driving. Her folks live nearby. - Hmm, old enough to drive, old enough to something-something. Come on. (people chattering) (people laughing) Oh, I'm so nervous. I haven't met your father's friends. - That makes two of us. (upbeat music) - [Emma] Second gear sticks sometimes. - Have you anything on hand of a liquid nature? I'm in need of courage right now, Dutch or otherwise. - You know where it is. - Emma, Emma, Emma, I'm terrified of seeing him. - Just go, be yourself. - Myself isn't good enough. He despises weakness. - You'll manage. - I always used to feel my life moving forward, you know? Towards something better. And then one night, there I was, driving through the Rockies, back in time, toward my past. With nothing to show for all the years except men I've known and plans that didn't work out. - And a son. - Who wants his father now. That's the cruelest thing, to raise a child and then watch his father steal him away. Emma, what's wrong? - I don't have time for your self-pity. Not today, just take the car and go. - Emma? What's the matter? Emma? What happened? - Police came. They turned the place upside down. - And I've been going on and on-- - Oh just leave, before I say something I'm sorry for. - Where's Cecil? - He took off, okay? He said not to wait for him. He'll um, he'll go to Canada again, or maybe Sweden, some of his friends are there. He's tired of fighting. - They can't do this, it's not legal! - You don't know that, do you? You don't really know anything about anything! - What have I done? - Nothing. You never did. People like you thought movement was a non-stop joyride. Well, it wasn't for some of us. And we are still paying for things we did back then. - So am I. - Don't listen to me, I am upset. Oh. I envy you, you know. What is it? Your ease, your confidence. See me, I could never live without doctrine. But you just sail along, day by day, relishing everything so much as though nothing could harm you. You walk off a cliff, land on your feet. - My confidence is a sham. - I know. I know, but something about your spirit inspired us. And you haven't lost it. Everything else is gone: the commune, Cecil. - I'll stay tonight if you like. - All we ever did was talk. I'd come down here, he'd come up. It was enough. Now he's gone, too. - Emma. - Oh, don't touch me. I'm fragile, but coping. (laughs) He'd hate tears. - I love you, Emma. - Don't worry. You go to Andrew, just be what you are. - Incandescent? - Yeah. - Irresistible? (laughs) - Yes. - Well, I see what you mean. - Is Elise there? - [Man] Eh, no, I don't see her. - Has she been in today? - Hey, how would you like some company abroad? - You? - Yeah. What do you think, look. - Wow. - Leave early. Maybe swing through Tibet and New Guinea. I'll show you my whole first trip, maybe shoot a new photo book. Spend some time together catching up, what do you say? - You know, mom's never been abroad. - Us, Marty, just the two of us. - Aren't you curious what she's like now? Even just a little? She's pretty great, dad, she talks about you all the time. - Look, Marty, you know sometimes something happens in life and you think it's the main event but it's not. Your mother and I came together briefly at a certain time. Then the world changed. - How? - Maybe we could find a better time to have this conversation. - Tomorrow, maybe? Or next year? Or when is a good time to ask why my parents can barely say each other's name, let alone tell me why we're not a family. - Look, your date didn't show, I'm sorry about that but it's not my fault. - Oh, then it must be mine! - I don't follow this twisty stuff. - Okay. My date was mom. - What? Are you crazy? - Well maybe I am. - She's coming here? This was her idea. - No, no, it was mine-- - That woman does not step foot in this house. - Take it easy, dad. - I'll pay for her hotel room in town if that's what she wants. And you can answer the door. - She canceled, okay? She had to work, she sends her regrets. - What the hell's your game, Martin? - It doesn't matter. It was just a pipe dream. - Well thank God you're getting away from her next year. All right, forget it. Come on, let's go upstairs and join the party, okay? I'm sorry, really, come on. ♪ Happy Father's Day to you ♪ Happy Father's Day to you ♪ Happy Father's Day Andrew and Martin ♪ ♪ Happy Father's Day to you - Thank you! (people cheering and clapping) One, two, three! (people cheering and clapping) - It was nice meeting you. - [Woman] That was lovely. - [Woman] Beautiful. - [Man] We've got a car. - It was great. - Yeah, my hair still won't dry. - [Man] Yeah, the one over there. - There are worse things in the world than being stood up by a date. - Well thank you for those words of comfort, Penny. - Are you drunk? - No, no Penny, I'm not drunk. My mother, my mother is drunk, at a bar somewhere, or maybe with a man. I tried to call her. But what's the point? She'd just, she'd make up some lie about why she didn't come here and I'd pretend to believe it. It's a little game we play called no secrets. You see, I wanted her here today, and I wanted you somewhere else. - I don't pretend to understand any of this. - You're beautiful. - What? - You have a great smile. - Mr. Martin, are you being a naughty boy? - You think he cares? He's throwing a party. You're, you're the cute chick he's dating. I'm the kid who turned out fine. It's a great life, but don't make waves. - Poor kid, you are really hurting, aren't you? Martin, no! N-O. Now I'm not gonna breathe a word of this but you better cool it. - He doesn't need anyone! Not you. Not me and not mom. And that's what makes him strong. - What the hell's going on here? - You better talk to your son, poots. He's in major trouble. - Okay, Penny. Explain yourself, and it better be good. - Look you in the eye? Spit it out? - Yes. - Great party, dad. - Wait a minute, where are you going, I'm talking to you. This is Elise, this is her behavior. - Who else was around to learn from, dad? - You've been drinking! You're going downstairs and you're going. - Well together at last. I hope I'm not too late for the fun. - Mom, where have you been? - It's all right, Martin, I'll handle this. - I think it would be a great idea if at least one person was saying goodbye out there who actually belongs to this family. - And who might this be? - I'm Penny. - Penny? You didn't use to settle for such small change. - Mom, behave. - She's very pretty, and I admire her shoes. - Excuse me. - Not much fight in that one. - Well, you've made your grand entrance, you've stirred things up. What next? - Relax, Andrew, I come in peace. - That'll be the day. - No, she's just having fun, dad. It doesn't mean anything. - Don't you think our little war of silence has outlived whatever purpose it never served? Let's bury the hatchet. - Yes, that's good. That's good, you stay, you stay here and talk. Oh, I don't feel-- - Oh, God! Andrew, give him a hand! Turn around. Sit down. - I'm fine, mom, I'm fine. (Elise mumbles) - Brings back memories. Wish me luck, angel. - Don't blow it again, mom. - You shouldn't have come here, Elise. Why did you? - See what I could see. Like the bear that came over the mountain. - Well, you've seen it now, satisfied? - Cecil is in trouble, did you know that? - You came all this way to tell me that? - You could help Cecil is all I mean. You know people. - He'd never accept help from me. I'm the sellout, remember? - You got a good price from the look of it. - No complaints. - None? - Goodbye, Andrew. Don't bother to call. (somber music) - Are you trying to provoke me? - That's too easy. I was teasing, exercising my sense of humor, of which you never did have much, did you, about yourself, I mean on a scale of one to 10, say. (laughs) - Elise. - Strange isn't it, how familiar it feels? Or is it just me? (engine roars) (car tires screeching) - Penny. She left. - Yes, well, maybe I better do the same. - Stay. There's room. (romantic music) - Nobody smokes anymore, have you noticed? (romantic music) (light piano music) - Last night, um, what happened, it was a, a bad idea. - You didn't enjoy it? Or it was good enough to scare you? - Don't you ever let up? - You used to like my passion. A little Russian blood (dramatic piano music) to thaw that chilly New England heart of yours. (light piano tinkling) - Martin says you work long hours. I'd like to help. With his schooling, maybe. - No doors are shut. (romantic piano music) ♪ That old black magic has me in its spell ♪ Remember? ♪ That old black magic that you weaved so well ♪ ♪ Icy fingers up and down my spine ♪ Missed my singing, didn't you? ♪ Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine ♪ (laughs) (singing softly) - No, no, no, no. No. No, this can't happen. We're both dreaming. You had my son for 15 years, and where were you? - I wrote to you many times. - Sure you did. - She did, dad, honest. - Okay, so maybe I never got around to mailing anything. Would you like to hear what I wrote? - Doesn't matter. Always starts out in some small lie and ends up in some bottomless fiction. - Dear Andrew, I've missed you. Not a day went by that I didn't regret having left. But you left me once. True, you were coming back when you'd seen the world, done your thing, whatever. But I knew then that if you could leave me when we were so in love, and a newborn son, when everything lay ahead of us, I knew you'd do it again one day like you're trying to do right now. So very stupidly, while you were gone, I ran. Pride is what it was. Stupid pride. Now, let's say my letter arrived. How would you reply, Andrew? Tell me. (laughs) - Oh man, I almost fell for it. First Martin shows up, then you. What's the deal here? You heard that I was doing well and you decided to head east and cash in? - No, that's not the way it was, dad. - You arrogant bastard! I've tried to be fair all these years. God knows I've said nothing against you to Martin. Now he'll hear the whole truth. - Truth? What do you know about the truth? - Don't argue, please. - Tell him about the money, go on. - Man, I knew that was coming. - What money? - You see, I didn't say a word. 9,000, was it? His precious inheritance. No fortune, but enough to make a difference. - To build a few bombs maybe, or torch a recruiting office? - None of us wanted violence. We were trying to stop the war. - It couldn't last, all of that. - Not if all of us ran away, like you did. - I didn't run away. I didn't run away. I asked you to come with me. - To drag an infant through disease and filth and squalor for three long years, so that you could make your mark taking pictures of the third world to put in a coffee table book for the radical-chic. - Fine, which is it? Martin, the money, my success? What exactly is my crime besides growing up? - That you pretended to care about so many things that in the end meant so little to you. - No. - No, what? - No. No, it's not the commune, the movement. It's none of those high-up things. That's not what you are really angry at. - Meaning what? - It's that you have no hold on me. After the trail of wounded men that you left behind, somebody finally escaped. Let's face it, Elise, when you refused to travel with me, you never dreamed in a million years that I'd leave without you and when I did, you were furious! And that's what you can't forgive. That you have no power over me! (somber soulful music) - [Elise] Didn't I have power last night? - [Andrew] Forget last night. - [Elise] And all those nights long ago, let's forget those, too. - [Andrew] I got carried away. - You didn't mean what you said? - Last night is history. - The Middle Ages. When you trembled in my arms-- - Stop it! - And cried and told me that you'd felt only half-alive without me. - For God's sake, that's enough. - No, no, not when it's still alive for the both of us. And you know it is. Now we were young and foolish the first time around, playing stupid games to hurt each other. We know better now. Isn't it time to forgive? - Wonderful. Now we forgive. You run away with my son and after 15 years, hello, I'm back, it's time to forgive? You can't suck me back into the past, I'm through with the past and all that craziness. I grew up and I made choices and I gave up those crazy dreams. I don't need them and I don't need you! And I don't need anyone! (somber piano music) - My poor lonely darling. You do believe, I know that. But your passion frightens you. It always did. Except with me. With me you could let go. Let go, Andrew. Let me hold you again. There's still time for a few more dreams. - No more. - What are you afraid of? - Between us the silence is a better idea. (somber music) - And that, dear Andrew, is what finally makes you small. - Don't. - And sad. - Mom, be quiet. - I'm warning you. - And so very, very alone. - Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up! - Oh go on, hit me. - Shut up! - If you can't run away, then kill what comes too close. - Get out, get out! - You wonder why I didn't wait for you. - Mom, please stop. - Come on, Martin. I think you've seen your real father now. (dramatic music) Martin? - I'm staying here. - Now! You get your things. - No. - Well say something to him, for God's sake! Andrew! (somber music) - I can't take care of her anymore. (somber music) (engine roars) Dad? - Pack your things, there's a 10:27 to the city. - Can I stay? - She turned heads, that woman. Everywhere she went. - Can I live with you, dad? - It's too late. We'll be good friends, I'd like that. Go home now. Work it out. She needs someone. - Why me? - You make a mess, you gotta clean it up. - Well guess what, dad? You go to hell, because it's not my mess and I am not cleaning up after the two of you anymore! - Martin! Martin! (dramatic music) (door slams) (somber music) - Where do you think you're going? - My job starts Monday. - That's right, run away. Like father, like son. - I can't take care of you anymore. Well, I'm sure that you'll find friends at the bar. - How dare you, after the way you behaved, humiliating me in front of that man. - Me? I tried to stop you and you wouldn't shut up! Look at you, you're disgusting! Is this why you sent me away, to keep me from seeing how you live? (somber music) - It's enough I have to see myself each day, why should you have to? - I know about all this, mom. I've always known. We have no secrets. - Oh angel, we all started out with such promise. If you could have seen us back then. Think, from all that hope, we made only one lasting thing, your father and I. Look at you. Isn't it strange what matters in the end? - I'm gonna stay here for the summer, mom. I'm not gonna take that hotel job. - No, no. - I can find a job here, we'll be together, mom. - It's time for your life, now. (somber music) - Why can't things be different? - Because angel, none of us can choose the way we love. Any complaints, see the man in the moon. Now, I'm centuries late for work. If Maurice will have me back, which he will, he's not a fool. Go on, darling, finish your packing. (somber music) There. We'll have a party before you leave. I'll invite Andrew. - Will you be all right? - Your mom's a tough old thing, you know. - I know. I love you, mom. - Then I did something right, didn't I? Bye, angel. (slow soulful music) (people chattering) (dramatic music) - Elise. (swelling soulful music) (soft soulful music)
