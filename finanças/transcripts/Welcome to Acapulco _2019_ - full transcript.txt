Subtitles by explosiveskull Can you believe it? This is all for me. And not in a good way. No. I've got the Mexican CIA, FBI, APD, and some real bad dudes on my ass. Why? I have no idea. Or at least I didn't at the time. All I knew is that I had been chased, shot at, bound, gagged, and got the shit beat out of me in just under a day. Far cry from my cozy cubicle back in New York City. Welcome to Acapulco. Where is it? So the bad guys caught up with me, I'm surrounded by feds, they all want God knows what, and I have absolutely no idea what to do. Except survive. Oh, shit. Okay, stop. Take a breath. I know what you're thinking. How do you kill off the main character in the first scene of an action flick? I mean, I am the main character, right? Because that guy kinda has a leading man thing going, and I know I've seen him before. Look, regardless, come with me, while I tell you a tale of how I ended up here. And just like all good stories in the digital age, this one begins and ends... with a cell phone. Before you say anything, I am just finishing up. What? How are you not at the airport? I just in a bit of a snag. I'm almost done. Dude, this is your game. Get the fuck out of there and do not let that piece of shit Carl make you his personal slave. - He's not, I'm... - Your flight's in two hours. - Do not miss it. - Look, I'll be on that plane. Yeah, yeah, we'll see. Shit. Video games. That's what I do. They've been my entire life up until today. I imagine them, I design them, I build them, all so you can escape for a few hours. Something I never get to do. Except for tonight 'cause I'm flying to New Mexico and unveiling to the publishers a sneak peek of my new work in progress... The most entertaining shooter game you will ever experience. If only my life were anything like this game. And that, my friends, is how it's done. Oh, and video games have really warped my brain. Just a head's-up. But every now and then, I'm freed from my cage. And who knows? If all goes well and the publishers love it, everything changes. Perhaps I'll be the hero for once. Save the world, even get a girl. Nah. Who am I kidding? Another trophy would be cool though. Good evening. So all that bitching, and I get to the airport early. Typical. I figured I'd kill an hour with a nice tall glass of... water. Just some water. Little ice. - You got it. - I had no idea... Get this guy a beer. ...that I was about to make my first major mistake. Water in the VIP lounge. Really? What the hell are you doing here? Scotch. Do me a favor. Send those to the table. Come on. Last time I drank with you, I ended up in Vegas. Ah! Remember that? So Tony's a friend of mine. Real estate agent. Father of three. No reason not to trust him. No reason at all, right? You need to loosen up. You're always worrying about what might happen instead of embracing the moments. You know? He's right. Let's have some drinks! Where ya headed? New Mexico. Showing the new video game I designed. New Mexico? Great place. You're gonna love it. Yeah, I've been there like 14 times. You and I need to work on our communication. Fuck this. Peace. I'm out. - Yeah, I do. - It's not normal. It is if you went to M.I.T. I just never get to have my own adventure. - You need a hobby. - Yeah? - Golf. - Golf? Yeah. You see this? This is a gift from Eastwood. Clint Eastwood gave you that watch? I shook hands with Harry Callahan. - Another round. - No more. To the rock and roll lifestyle! Tony, I love you man. You know, you get me in trouble a bunch, but you... Where the fuck you go? Don't drink before you fly. Borracho. Feo. Apistoso. Excuse me, miss? Can I get you something, sir? Ah, no, no. Well, maybe some water. Anything else, sir? Yeah. What time are we gonna land? We're running a little late, but we should touch down in about half an hour. Thank you. Water, water. Ese es borracho. Excuse me. So sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently preparing our descent. We expect to land at 7:15 a.m., twenty minutes later than your scheduled time. If you want to adjust your watch, it is 7:02. The weather is sunny, and the temperature is 28 degrees Celsius. We wish you a pleasant stay in Acapulco, and we hope to see you again very soon. - On behalf of all our crew... - Fuck me. ...thank you. What the hell is going on here? Excuse me, sir? Did they say Acapulco? Tell me that there is an Acapulco in New Mexico. No, sir. Acapulco's in regular Mexico. Regular Mexico?! Yes, sir. Welcome to Acapulco. - Permiso, por favor. - No, no. Can you move, please? Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Uh, what? You're where? Acapulco. Like Mexico? Holy shit. Dude, I said New Mexico, not regular Mexico! Did you skip out on us, motherfucker? No, no, no. I was on the plane. It was the wrong plane. - You got on the wrong plane? - I have my ticket. How the fuck do you get on the wrong plane? Like they check your fucking ticket. This is the wrong ticket. This isn't mine. Oh, my God. I can't believe you fucked this up. No, it's the right plane. It's the wrong ticket! What the hell does that even mean? This is your career, dude, and you're... I'll call you back real soon. I gotta go. Welcome to Acapulco, sir. Take it off, please. Yeah, take it off. What is the purpose of your visit? Actually, I'm not supposed to be here. Just a second, please. Licenciada, Sophia. Come with me, please. So, Mr. Booth, it appears you made quite a fuss out there. What exactly is the issue here? I was told you claimed you got on the wrong flight. Look, I don't know how this happened. So I proceeded to tell her the whole story, or what I knew of it anyway, how I was supposed to be in New Mexico, not regular Old Mexico, and how I had a showing of my new video game, how Wrath of Todd was this super fun shooter game with tons of unexpected twists and turns, and how I think she'd totally like it 'cause she's in law enforcement, and this is like... A totally get-all-the-bad-guys kinda game with shoot-em-up and guns and explosions. Mr. Booth! Are you on drugs? No. Do you have a drinking problem? No! No! Look! The last thing I remember, I was in the VIP lounge in JFK, all right? I was having some drinks with a friend. We had a couple of beers. That's it. And then, I don't know. I must have passed out or something and... There's that look again. Look. I need to buy a ticket that gets me to New Mexico. That's it. Are we done? Okay. This wasn't a huge deal. Suck it up, buy a ticket and get the fuck out of here. T-minus six hours and counting you, limp dick fuck. What do you want me to tell them? I am buying the next ticket to Albuquerque, and I am on my way! Here we go! The earliest I can get out of Acapulco is tomorrow? I can book your connecting flight to Mexico City - for tomorrow morning. - No, I need to leave today. Yeah, we all need to leave today! - That's not possible, sir. - Why not? All the flights are full. It's a holiday weekend in Acapulco. And with that, my soul slowly drained from my body. It's the only seat I have for for tomorrow morning. Take it! Make up your mind! I can get you a complimentary voucher at the Del Cana hotel for your stay tonight with us. Just take it! Take the voucher! All right, lady. Calm down. Bingo tournament won't start without you. - Here you are. Hotel voucher. - Okay. Our taxi driver knows your destination. That guy looks scary. Probably should've noted that. Hey, I've got bad news. I can't get out of here until tomorrow. This would be a good time to recap. Let's, let's see here. My career is over, the end. Okay. I'm sorry. That was immature of me. Wait. Those are feds. Yeah? I can smell those assholes miles away. Fuck. You're fucking me right now, you know that? Don't fucking yell, dude. I'm not a child, all right? - You're gonna have to present. - No, dude, listen... - You know it as well as I do. - No. I don't... - Just stall 'em. I gotta go. - Don't fucking hang up... You guys still with me? Good. 'Cause it's about to get a hell of a lot crazier. - Fuck! Matt? - Yeah. Can you give me your password? 6-1-4-3. Wait, wait, you cut out. 6-4... No, no. 6-1... How was your flight, Mr. Booth? I'm on the telephone. Six, one... Wait, wait. - How do you know who I am? - 6-4-3? I'm Agent Block. This is agent Kessler, CIA. - Matt! - We need to talk, Mr. Booth. - Fuckin' guy! - Okay, Jesse, just one minute. - I don't have a minute, Matt. - Um, do you have some ID? Mr. Booth is going to have to call you back. - Let me ask you a question. - What are you doing? I'm only gonna ask you once, so answer honestly, Mr. Booth. Yeah, what the hell is going on? Do you have the package? So you're gonna hear a lot about this package. But don't worry. You didn't miss anything. I'm just as confused as you. The package? Is it with you? Okay. Maybe you guys don't understand the morning I'm having. But the last thing I need is two creepy guys giving me dirty looks and asking stupid fucking questions. It'd be wise to answer my colleague's question. Do you have the package? What the fuck is the package? What is the package? Is it gold? Is it drugs? Is it candy? - Check the case. - Get your hands off my bag! Hey, hey, hey! Matt! ¡Mi amor! Sorry, guys, can I borrow my fiancé? Thank you. - Fiancé? - Do as I say or we're both dead. - Hey! - Run, run, run! Get in the car. We have agents following the package, but there is something else. - Yeah, what's that? - Adriana. Puta madre. Who are you? Who are they? Who the hell are they? Stop asking questions! What the hell do they want with me? I need to get you someplace safe. - Did you catch him? - Not yet. You put these two fuckups on us, didn't you? And you just made the director of the CIA come all this way to arrest a nobody. Hold up. Nobody? If I'm a nobody, then why the hell is everyone in Acapulco trying to find my ass? Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Well, that nobody is holding the most valuable information on the planet, so I suggest that you catch that son of a bitch before Tony's guys do. Have you tracked Woods down? Master of disguises? I wouldn't even know it if I did. Where's my goddamn package? Good morning to you too. It arrived in Acapulco over an hour ago. You should have it by now. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Hold up. Stop. I think that might be... Tony? That looks a lot like Tony. Is that Tony? Yeah, yeah. That's Tony! With a pornstache? Huh? That's weird. I didn't pay a $60 million deposit to be told I should have it by now. And I sure as hell didn't pay to have the CIA waiting... I guaranteed delivery, and that's exactly what happened. If you lost the package, that's not my problem. I'm starting to think Tony might be more than just an estate agent. I want what I fucking paid for, Woods! And if you want the other half of your payment, you better make damn sure that happens! I'll look into it. Where were we? Ah, yes. Employee loyalty. So you know that package is right out in the open. So I could probably get it for you tonight. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that. I hired you for one thing, Mr. Hyde. Just to go to the airport, get that courier, and deliver him to me. Sounds like that courier's in deep shit. I feel bad for whoever that is. Yeah, well, I wish it was that easy. Mr. Hyde... I'm a United States senator, chairman of the military affairs committee. When I make a request, it's not a request. Are we clear? Yeah, it's clear. Lunch is on me. Well, thanks. I can protect you if you do as I say, so stay in the car. Now, I know what you guys are thinking: Is Adriana married? Does she have a boyfriend? Well, I don't know. That's something I'm gonna have to look into. I don't know why she would've popped into my life, if she were taken. That's probably what she's telling me right now, that she's in love with me and wants to be my girlfriend! My girlfriend is such a badass! I just got one question for you, guys. How does somebody escape that doesn't even have any covert training, doesn't even have any special ops knowledge? How are they gonna get away from you? There was an unknown quantity with them. A woman. That's a quantity. Girls will be girls. Who was she? We don't know. Well, if you don't know, then you haven't been paying attention to the things that I want you to do. If you're not paying attention to what I want you to do, then, really, like... what good are you, huh? Huh? Look, we're on it. We'll get it done. Okay, she's not in love with me, but she is all mad at me now for not paying attention to her. Take note. If I had been, I'd know a lot of people want me dead, and that I need to do everything she tells me. Where are you going? I need to see someone. I'll be back in an hour. You said you were gonna tell me what's going on. I will... when I get back. Block and Kessler aren't the only ones looking for you. I'm trying to keep you alive, so help me out. Why should I trust you? You shouldn't. - Stay here. - Okay. I love her, but if I want to get some real answers, I'm gonna have to go straight to the source. I'm gonna need a new one, Pedro. - Sí señor. - Gracias. - Tony, it's Matt. - Hey, buddy. How you doing? How's the weather in New Mexico? I'm not in New Mexico! I'm in Acapulco! What? Acapulco? What are you doing in Acapulco? I don't know. You tell me. Last thing I remember, we were having drinks in JFK. I wake up, I'm in Acapulco, man! And everyone seems to think I got some fucking package! - Package? - I know. It's fucking crazy. Well, where are you right now, exactly? I don't know. I'm in some hotel. It's really nice. It's all pink and white. It's, uh... Now, if I had known any better, I would've tried to throw him off by saying I was at Holiday Inn or the Overlook Hotel, or that I was standing in the lobby of a Howard Johnsons, and I was wearing a pink carnation, but I didn't know any better. - Uh, Las Brisas. - Okay, stay there. I have a contact in the American consulate. I'll make a call. - All right, hurry. - Hey, no worries. What are friends for? I'll call you back. He's got a contact at the American consulate? Oh, shit. I knew I should've noted that guy. Now, how in the hell did these guys find me? I have so many questions! Who are they working for? How many more of them are there? Are these pools heated? Why do they want me dead? Hey there, you've reached Matthew Booth... I can't believe you, dude. This fucking guy. Are you kidding me? I'm trying to help you, you dumb fuck. Help me! Somebody please help me! You can do this. You're a fucking action star. Oh, my God! I'm gonna die! Oh. Hmm. Pools are heated. All right, you know what? I've had just about enough of this bullshit. Is there a police station nearby? Uh, yes, sir. Actually, there's one very close by. - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. If you could just call a cab, take me to the police station? So I haven't been doing this action hero thing very long, but one thing I've learned from the movies is... ditch your car, so you won't be tailed. I'm not gonna lie. This is kind of exciting. Um, your taxi will be waiting for you right that door. Mucho gracias. De nada. I love the feel of real things between my fingers, don't you? Wow. This guy is really profound. You know who would love him? My friend Tony. Excuse me? It's a shame. Everything's digital now. Newspapers, games, all social interaction. Sex. It's all gone online. Whatever happened to just... holding something in your hand and appreciating it? If you wanna talk shit, I suggest you find yourself an escort. You wanna talk business, you really should be more to the point. You're a woman after my own heart. You understand my need? Location of the package and to be sure it reaches its destination. And it's time-sensitive. Is that gonna be a problem? Not at all. I'll put Hammer on it. Hammer. I like that name. - Package is not here. - Then where the hell is it? If it is in Acapulco, he has to have it. Then you better get to him before the feds do. If I lose that package, you're done. What the fuck is the package? Is it a bomb? Is it Anthrax? Poison? Understood. Enjoy my dirty underwear and half-written love letters to Adriana, fellas. Keep searching. I've made it to the cops. - Do you speak English? - Ruiz! Do you speak English? - English and Spanish, sir. - All right. I need to report myself as a missing person. - Missing? - Sí. - Uh, uh... - You gotta calm down, sir. You're gonna get a heart attack. Come with me. Thank God you speak English. We have to in this line of work, you know. Too many tourists. So how long you been missing? My plan is to let them know exactly what's going on, that I'm being hunted and my life has been threatened. So I go to the hotel, these two creepy guys show up out of nowhere - then this beautiful woman... - Okay, okay. I'll get the American consulate for you. You don't have to worry. Everything is gonna be fine. There's water over there. Took you fuckin' long enough, asshole. - Jesse, it's me. - Yeah, no shit. Where the fuck are you, dude? Right now I'm at the police station. What are you talking about? I don't have time for this shit. I just need your fucking password. Well, that's wonderful, but I'm actually in some really serious shit right now. Okay, dude, this is the biggest project that we've done, and you're not fucking here right now. I'm hiding in a hallway, hoping they haven't given up on us. Just give me the goddamn password... Shit. Matt? Matt! Fucking stupid fucking... Damn it! Fuck! Fuck! Ohh! You don't get it, do you? I wonder what she likes in a guy, Strong, sensitive, caring. She likes a smart guy. Do you think I'm her type? I bet she likes a guy with a beard. I'm gonna have to work on my tan. What the hell are you thinking? They have people everywhere. And who are they? These assholes again. See? I was a lot safer in the police office with the guy. He offered me water. And you? I got these motherfuckers chasing me everywhere I go. Look, Adriana, I know Acapulco's beautiful and all, but now is not the time to show me the fucking amphitheater. Oh, it's quite nice. We should come back here sometime. Okay, let's just be adults. Let's communicate. I don't have this package. There's no... Why you gotta go fucking with my day, man? Look me in the eye! Hey, stop right there! Okay. Who's your little helper, huh? You don't wanna get gunned down! No, no, no, I don't. - Hey! Whoa! - Enough! Get this over with! Whoa! Oh! Who the fuck are you? Agent Hammer, CIA. Pretty cool name, man. Look at this guy. He's got a beard, he's fit and ripped, his name's Hammer. Wish my name was Hammer. Booth, Hammer. Booth, Hammer. He's got a gun, badass with his man-bun and shit. How the fuck am I gonna compete with that? - He's with me. - Yeah. You may have gotten this far, but you're still gonna need my help, and if I'm gonna help you, I need to know everything that you know. This can't be happening. We know the package was passed to you in New York. Do you have it with you now? I'm gonna tell you what I told them, okay? I don't know what you're talking about, all right? I went through my suitcase, there was nothing in it. This? This is not my life, okay? I'm not some international spy. Do you know who I am? Do you know what I do? I'm a computer video game programmer! I'm not fucking Jason Bourne! Booth! Matthew Booth! Why don't you take us to the hotel? I'd like to have a little conversation with our friend here. I don't think that's a good idea. It's okay. By tomorrow morning, you can put all this shit behind you and get back to playing your computer games. Well, I don't play them. I design them. It's different. Really. Very different. It's like an adult thing. You know, a grownup. I have a job. I mean, as a kid I played them, but I don't do that anymore. Dude, I can't believe you right now. I'm trying to save your fucking career. I can't log in. Call me back immediately. Now, what's the room number? We'll show you. That won't be necessary. There's no need for you to leave the car. I'll handle this. You remember what Yardley back in Virginia would say? Never let a source out of your sight. Yardley was a fool. This is different. Yeah, 'cause I'm not a source. I'm a person, so... What the fuck! Jesus Christ! Whoa! Fuck! Shit! What the fuck! That was a CIA guy! - He wasn't CIA. - He wasn't? There's no Yardley back in Virginia. "Agent Hammer." This is fake. - How do you know that? - Trust me. I know. I am CIA. Is there anybody in this town that's not fucking CIA? What the fuck happened there, Stark? Block and Kessler are dead. Shot to shit. Looks like the target had assistance. Listen, I want Matt Booth, and I want that bitch who's helping him. Yes, sir. CIA? Why didn't you just say that from the beginning? I'm not here on official business. You wouldn't believe me anyway. Yeah, I don't know if I believe you now. What? What is this? CIA headquarters. Ask to speak to Agent Adriana Vazquez. Central Intelligence Agency. How may I help you? Agent Adriana Vazquez, please. Please hold the line. Agent Adriana Vazquez. I'm not available right now. Please leave your message, or press 3 to speak to Agent Enrique Vazquez. Okay. I believe you. Sure. You don't wanna talk to Enrique? He'll confirm everything. No, I'm fine. So, uh, Enrique Vazquez, he's your... Please say brother. He's my brother. Tell me if you see some things missing. Okay, well, help me out. What am I looking for? What the fuck is the package? Is it Bitcoins? A nuke? Is it a sex tape? I'm kinda running out of things here. What was I supposed to have smuggled into Mexico? Information. Information? Don't you think I deserve a little more information than "information?" Yes, you do, and I'd give you more if I had it. How do you not have it? You're fucking CIA! All I know is files were copied from a server at a CIA black site. What those files are is above my pay grade. But if they sent me to get them, they must be very important. All right, then answer me this. If I have this information, how'd I get it? You can thank your friend Anthony. Tony? Tony Woods? - Yeah. He was CIA. - CIA? No! He's an estate agent! Trust me. He was one of the best, until he sold classified information to the highest bidder. I'm starting to think Tony might have lied to me. Why me? Come here. - What? - Come here. I mean, if he's who you say he is, why didn't he just come down here himself? News got out he had the files, so now there's a price on his head. Mind blown. It all makes sense. The disguises, getting me drunk, telling the Mexican gang where I am. He used me. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead. Okay. So what do we do now? Adriana? Hyde will love to know that you are involved. Hyde's here. Who the fuck's Hyde? He's a mercenary. - Sorry. - Don't make me kill you. Last thing I want is for you to kill anyone. Oww! Fuck! Suka! She broke my nose! She broke my nose. It's not broken. Did you kill her? She's just sleeping. Enrique, tengo su problema. I know there are guys, like my best friends, who would've gotten out of there the minute that they realized their girlfriends were much tougher than them, but I didn't. I gotta admit the truth. It turned me on. We need a pickup. I'm working on it. I need time. We don't have time. Fine. Be at the pier in five minutes. Don't take too long. - You get a weapon. - Hmm? What? Oh, shit. There are moments in life that define who you are. Who you inherently are. Not who you've been hiding behind. Most never get to face their true selves because most never leave the comfort of their safety zones. And believe me, I never would have, not voluntarily anyway. But then I would've never met her, I would've never really met myself... and I would never ever know what I was truly capable of. But now... we're about to find out. Run! Use the gun! Game starts now. So I just killed a whole bunch of people. Figured I'd just go with it. She, on the other hand, seemed to really get off on it. Go to the boat. "Hey, nice work, Matt. Oh, thanks, Adriana." Whatever. It's been a long time, huh? That's for my brother. Put the fucking gun down. You fucking know these guys? We used to live in the same neighborhood. Different time, different life. Fuck no! This guy's got tattoos, and he speaks Spanish, and they've got history, got all sorts of stories when they were kids, and they played soccer together. Fuck, I'm screwed. Listen, all I want is the package. Tell Hyde he can't have it. What are you talking about? Who's Hyde? Finally! Someone just as confused as I am. I'm starting to like this guy. All right, let's go through this again. Tony Woods. Liar, liar, pants on fire. Consider our friendship effectively over. The senator. Well, he's the senator. They are all crooks, so there's that. Hyde. Scary motherfucker, works for the senator. Block and Kessler. Fake feds. And they're dead. Moving on. This fella. Bad guy? Good guy? I don't know. Who cares? Not dating my girlfriend. That's all that matters. This Miss Ryker chick? Useless pawn in this deadly game to take down the senator. Hammer. Cool name, not CIA. Does it really matter? He's dead. Fuck it. Let's go. You know who is the real deal though? Adriana Vazquez, Definitely CIA. Didn't really check the badge super good, but it looked really authentic, and we're gonna get married and have some babies. This character breakdown was brought to you by Las Brisas. Hotel Las Brisas. Slip away to a secluded oasis. You owe me... so get out of my way. Let 'em go. Let them leave! Did you see what I did with the gun? What the hell is going on? Those guys were chasing me all morning, and now they're our friends? Where the hell are we going anyway? Calm down. You ask too many questions. Well, maybe if you answered one of them, I wouldn't have to. Geez, I'm sorry I'm not calm enough for you, but I don't like shooting people and getting shot at. Maybe you're used to this life, but I'm not! Sometimes you don't have a choice. Who was that guy? Not your lover. Not your lover. Not your lover. Not your lover. Raphael. That doesn't answer my question. My brother's ex-partner. We all grew up together. As a friend! What happened? They were undercover. Raphael turned, and my brother almost died. I wish I was there. What is it? My favorite place in the world. La Roqueta Island. She looks so pretty on this boat. We are looking at Adriana and the package getting off the boat now. Bring their sorry asses to me. I want both of them alive, do you understand me? Loud and clear, sir. Here! - Run! Go, go, go! - What? Go! Go! Now! Run! Keep it going. I'm an action star. Who's an action star? You're an action star. Goddamn it, these steps are fucking killing me. These steps are fucking killing me. Is he still behind me? Yeah, he's still behind me. Adriana! Don't. Fuck it. If there's one thing I've learned through all of this, it's that there is always redemption. That and Jesse's a piece of shit. Holy shit! That hurt. Note to self: no more hitting people. Just shoot them. I'm starting to sound like my girlfriend. Badass! Come on! Get in the car! Get in the fucking car right now! Now, I know getting in this dude's car is the absolute wrong thing to do, but what are my options? Go! Go! I'm just hoping his history with Adriana pays off. I let you go the first time, but you're not gonna get a second chance. Hey! Oh, fuck. So I'm off somewhere blindfolded, and this is the next scene in the movie? What are the odds? Apparently we have the same taste in women. How did you get in here? Young lady, I would rather be anywhere else. I'd rather be on my plane headed back home. But this situation requires an immediate result, so I have to do it myself. If you have a question, ask it. Seems we have a mutual friend. I don't think you and I keep the same circle of friends, Senator Campbell. Oh, you know who I am. Now, that sort of information is dangerous to me. It's fine. It's what I do. Client confidentiality is important, so... Unfortunately, I'm not one of your clients. Does your pretty little friend here have the same ideas on privacy as you do? Look at me. Young lady! You will now tell me everything I want to know about Anthony Woods. Matt, are you there? Hello, Agent Vazquez. Surprise. It's been awhile. Drake. What are you doing here? Well, you didn't leave me with much of a choice after our last encounter. You had me falsely branded a criminal, and I had to get out of the States in a hurry. I knew at this point, I had to say something. Matt, relax. Sorry about the gag. Your friend had a lot to say about nothing. Eh, not... I... I was... Jerk. Take the bag off his head. I'll get to that. Tell me who he is first. He's not involved. Sounds like he disagrees. Come on. You're better than this. That's what I thought about you. Um, she can't get any better. Fuck this guy. Look where that got me. I thought we were special, Adriana. I thought we had a future. I did not just hear that. Then you went and fucked that up. I was doing my job. 'Course you were. How about this clown? What's your name? I'm Agent Matt Booth with Interpol. You're interfering with an international investigation, so you better cut us loose. Don't lie to me, Mr. Booth. I know exactly who you are. You're the courier. Then why the fuck did you ask me? Ah, shit. He has beautiful blue eyes. This might be bad. Look away, Adriana. Do not look into his eyes. Look away. Do not look into his... Ah, shit! She's lost in his eyes. You look good, Adriana. You fucked up. Really badly. Right now I have to look him in the eye and tell him that we don't have the package for the second time. Hey, better than looking into Savage's baby blues. Those things are mystic pools of wonder. I'll fix it. Should I trust you? - Senator. - Mr. Hyde. I think it's time you knew more about Anthony Woods. Ah, you get it, you get it. Sounds like a good idea. Why are we here? Because I want what's rightfully mine. Uh, you're gonna need to be more specific. Look, you should know by now I don't have whatever it is. It's the truth. Then why are you protecting him? Because that's my job. Did you hear that? She said because loves me. I think that's what she said, I wasn't paying attention. But she was saying it with her eyes and her mind. Yeah. Always about the job with you, isn't it? And with you, it's always personal. Mm-hmm. There is definitely something going on here. You and I need to work on our communication. Fuck this. Peace. I'm out. Sit. Sit. Please. This may just be another assignment for you, Adriana, but you forced your way into my life, into my family. You used us to get to my brother, and then he wound up dead. Oh, no, wait! Which brother? - He was a criminal. - No. - Dealing in weapons. - That's bullshit. My brother dealt in telecommunications. He was trying to better the world, to empower people. They put target on his head because he threatened their goddamn profits. They were tracking him for months. I saw the files. You saw what they wanted you to see. That's right. Your beloved CIA betrayed you, Adriana. My brother was a hero, not a criminal. - No. - Really? It's all right there. See for yourself. But first let's talk about what your friend here is carrying. I want what I paid for. And what exactly did you pay for? This is it, guys. Here we go. So I was told that Woods was... approaching a lot of interested parties with information that he apparently acquired somewhere. Do you know what's on those files, what makes them so important? - Do I wanna know? - Yes. It's a detailed listing of all the black ops funded by the CIA. It's all there. A detailed history of operations in Libya, Iran, and Afghanistan. Proof of attacks on US soil, designed to justify Pentagon spending and to fuel the flow of cash directly back into the industrial military complex. Assassinations of government officials, religious leaders, and prominent businessmen from around the world. Do you have any idea what you're suggesting? I'm not suggesting anything. It's fact. And Woods offered much more than that. Not only past operations, but schedules for those about to happen. Mass murders in Europe staged to look like terrorist attacks, with a money trail leading directly back to the White House. What the fuck's that shit about? Woods started a bidding war for the decryption code that unlocks the rest of those files. Why don't we just find Woods and kill him? Yeah. Good luck with that. I haven't recognized him once this entire movie. Package is being held by a fucking nobody. I could have it back by tonight. Excellent. Only nobody knows where the fuck Woods is. And by the way, you haven't found that fucking nobody. If I had the information on those files, you have any idea what kinda power I'd have? I'd control the Senate, the Congress, the CIA. All of them would be puppets, and I would be pulling the strings. How would you like to be working for the next President of the United Fucking States of America? So what makes you and everyone else think that I'm the courier? Because Anthony told me he was sending you, after I paid him a $60 million dollar deposit on the decryption code. If we had the package, we wouldn't be here. That's why we're all going to remain here until Anthony arrives. Why would Anthony come here? Because your friend here is going to ask him. Someone should tell this guy that me and Anthony aren't exactly on speaking terms right now. So? What did he say? Well, he said it's time to put together a brand-new team. - Whenever I've heard that... - I'll start calling them up. it usually meant I was getting fired. That's a good idea. I wonder what getting fired looks like in the criminal world. Except you are part of... the old team. Oh. At least it wasn't her ear. Drake. That guy better not try to make a move on my girlfriend. Uh, I'm pretty sure I can trust her. I doubt she would ever go behind my back and... my... my... What the fuck is this on my back? What the fuck? Wait! Hold up! That's the package? This little pill that was shoved in my back? Oh, I see. There's like technology in there. Wonder what's on it. So what are you gonna do if you get the files? Release them to the press. People have a right to know. Plus that file proves my brother's innocence. How about you, Adriana? What's your orders after you get the decryption code, huh? How about your friend? He expendable too? Well? Am I? No, you're not. Oh, okay. That's what I thought. What if I told you I knew where the package was and I could find Woods? I'd ask you how much you want for that information. Keep your money. This is how it's gonna go. New identities for a new life. What about Savage? I'm not going back. I'm moving forward. I complete her. Yes! Yeah, and, uh... No, just dump her body where we always do. That's fine. H-How did you get in here? It was easy. Shit. Going somewhere? Hmm? I hear you've been talking to Senator Campbell. Sorry. He's just gone too far with costumes. I'm just playing it safe. Basically, she knows too much about the senator. Tony likes to kill people. The next part makes sense. Here you go. - Yeah. - I found your package. This is state of the art technology. I'm impressed. And I know you are in Acapulco. Mundo Imperial. Nice. So if you ever wanna see this thing again, and unless you want the CIA knocking on room 4403 in the next five minutes, you're gonna meet me, you're gonna look me in the eye and give me some answers. I'll send the location. I know, I know, I'm playing with fire. Especially when this guy clearly enjoys eliminating loose ends, like Miss Ryker here. Enrique... Hey, buddy. Long day? You look ridiculous. So I'm impressed. How did you find me? It was easy. I had your number. Ran it through some line-tracing software. Encrypted line. Could only narrow it down to a few-mile radius. Only a few hotels in the area. I knew you wouldn't stay under your name. And then I remembered your obsession with Clint Eastwood. - You met Clint Eastwood? - You bet I did. You shook his hand? I shook hands with Harry Callahan. Callahan. Callahan. And there it was right in front of me. Staying in room 4403, one Harry Callahan. I'm so fuckin' good! I actually really like action scenes when I'm not the one getting shot at. Ohh! Stay down, Raph! Stay down! Drake Savage. Marion Fucking Hyde. Tell me, was your dad a big John Wayne fan, or your mama was just hoping for a little baby girl? Well, I guess that's gonna remain one of the great mysteries of life. You know, we both know you're nothing but a fucking traitor. We both know that's not true. Well, then maybe, uh, I'll just collect the bounty. Once that file's made public, your bounty is not gonna be worth the steam off your piss. That's a good line. Well? Where's the goddamn courier? Where's he hiding? What'd you do with him? On advice of counsel, I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege and respectfully decline to answer the question. You wanna deal with Mr. Savage, you'll have to go through me first. Whew. The decryption code. And why would I give you that? This is why. That's right. I'm a fuckin' action hero. Put it down. Oh, shit! I'm a fuckin' action hero! I said put it down. So you know how some of you are thinking she's just playing me, and I'm just oblivious to the whole thing? Apology accepted. Don't do it again. Okay, this is how it's gonna go. Give me the chip. I don't have it. You think I brought it with me? It's someplace safe. Where? Where is it? You're going straight to hell, Hyde. That's kinda funny. Exact same thing that your brother said right before I had him killed. They shot him in the back of the head. - Fucking cowards. - Yeah. Answer that fucking phone. Put it on speaker. Woods. Be ready to make the transfer. La Quebrada, 30 minutes. Well, well. Funny. Guess you'll be living a little bit longer than I thought. Vamos. Where is it? Stay right there. She moves, shoot her. Give me the case. Okay, asshole. Where is it? You got 30 seconds. Give me one good reason not to shoot you in the fuckin' head. How about because if you kill me, you don't get the deactivation code? You kill me, and it dies. Adriana, I know you can hear me. Look at me, baby. Adriana, I know you can hear me. I'm gonna get you out of this. I'm gonna get me out of this. Blink if you can hear me. Just blink once if you can hear me. There you go, baby. There you go. How many seconds I got left? Cut him loose. Go ahead, cut him fucking loose. Go ahead. Transfer the money. I want my other 60 million. Welcome to the real world. What the fuck did you do? If this works, Tony will lose everything. M.I.T. CIA! Drop your weapons! Don't move! Don't move! Drop your weapons! Fuck it. No! My friend Tony, ladies and gentlemen. And there you have it. The story of how I ended up here. Hope you enjoyed the ride. Now I'm gonna go save my career while you see how the rest of this plays out. Laters! Matt! This is for my brother! Move! Move! Enrique! - I'm okay. I'm okay. - You okay? You sure? - We need to find him. Please. - I will. A doctor, please! What? You know what? You're done. Oh, I'm done? You set me up, you son of a bitch! That's not true. You crossed the line. I had to take that chance. You know it, and I know it. You kept me in the dark. Now it's time to pay. It's that simple. You know, if you weren't such a traitorous prick, we would've made a great team. Whatever. Goodbye, Mr. President. Are you fucking threatening me? How about fuck you? You think you can scare me? Fuck you! The investigation's closed. The courier and the files, both lost. Look, I'm sorry about Matt. At least you were clear of any involvement. I had nothing to hide. Come on, I know that. Yo sé. It's so good to have you back. I don't trust the system anymore. Don't decide yet. Just think about it for a while, okay? Take care. Better catch up with this. So in the end, it all worked out. The bad guys lost, the files were destroyed, and I got to live. The phone didn't actually stop the bullet, by the way. Savage gave me a bulletproof vest. Don't wanna see you get your ass shot off. What, did you think I was gonna die? No, I swam out to La Roqueta Island and grew a beard, got a tan. Waited for the heat to blow over and then... reached out to my lady. How? Maybe I wasn't such an easy target. Let's go home. Subtitles by explosiveskull
