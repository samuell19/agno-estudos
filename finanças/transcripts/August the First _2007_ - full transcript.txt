(exotic music) (singing in foreign language) - [Woman] Who's making all that noise? - Sorry grandma. (phone ringing) - [Grandma] Tunde, the phone. - Hey how you doing? - Hey, what's going on? Good, food's in the back, enjoy yourselves, relax. (horn honking) Hey, how you doing man? - Yeah, I know I'm sorry already alright - [Woman] I don't understand. You act like got a meeting, your ass doesn't even show up. - Look, mom made me pick up mad stuff from the store. What do you want me to do? - What happened to your phone, Tunde? - [Tunde] I forgot it at home. - You're not a kid anymore, Tunde. - [Tunde] When are you gonna be here? - [Ade] What are you doing? - Don't even start, man, leave it alone. Stop, stop, leave this alone. - [Ade] Hey, this is stupid, son. - Stop, don't touch this, don't do it, man. Stop, back up! - So aggravating. - [Ade] Tunde, stop! - Would you focus please? - I just wanna tell you in person, all right? Please, just in person. Stop, I'm on the phone, man, shut up! What is your problem? - Not a day back and your brother's already on my nerves, you know that? - Just try not to kill him before I get there. I'll be there in 10. - [Tunde] What is your problem? - People are starting to come over. You may wanna greet your guests. - What is your-- - Get ready! Go up and get ready! - You worry about yourself! - Go up and get ready. - [Grandma] Ade, could you take me out back, please? I'm tired of hearing you two argue. - Go on, man. - You know what? You smell and you look like bum. You should take a shower, go upstairs. - I look like a bum? These are your cloths! - It's a nice day out here today. Ooh, it's lovely. Ooh, slow now, slow it down. (chuckling) - Hey, Ade. Come give your aunty a kiss. - What do you want me to do, jump in? - Come talk to me after you take of her. - [Grandma] Yeah, like you take care of yourself. - Whatever, mama. - Pull me over there. I don't wanna have to hear her mouth. - [Janine] You'll have to move father than that. - Tunde! - Hey, what's going on? - Congratulations, man. - Thank you. - Did you see Simi come through here? Is she in the bathroom? - [Tunde] I don't know, I guess, go knock. - You go the other bags? - Yeah. - Hey! - Hey! Hi, baby. - [Ade] How come you never treat me like this? - 'Cause you're here everyday. - Aww, Ade, come on, this is my baby. Baby, the graduate is home. - You look good, mom. - Thanks, sweetie. Guys, put those away for me, okay? - Ma, don't you think it's a little early for that? - Grown, Tunde. Ah, this is terrible. - I got something better for you, mom, okay? - [Mom] Okay. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm better. - Don't worry, sweetie, I'm fine. - Mom, it's not even 12. You know you got no business drinking now. - Hey, mom. - Hey, baby girl. I have all my babies in one room. - Are you starting already? - Oh, no, not you too. Simi, I just need something to calm my nerves. - Your nerves, at noon? - Thank you. - [Mom] Don't start, okay? - So you ready now, negro? - [Mom] Ready for what? - This big surprise he's gotta tell me. - [Mom] He didn't tell you this morning? - No, of course not. He decided to stand me up. - Well, ma, you sent me to the store and I was running late. (laughing) - You couldn't of gone to the store-- - Shut up. - After you met your sister? - No, ma, the store was already on my way. It didn't make any sense. - Let's make this happen. - Just chill for a minute, all right? Just do it later. - Chill, I've been chillin' for the past week. - All right, come on, come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. (phone ringing) - What? - Hello, this is Tunde. No, why, where are you? No, no, no, just, no just stay at the corner. I'll be right there. - What the hell is going on with him? - Don't ask me, this is all on him. Is that you? I said wait on the corner! - Tunde, how are you, huh? - So is this what you had to tell me? Hello. - Tunde did not tell you I was coming? - No. - Tunde why did you not tell your sister of my arrival? - Who's that guy? - My father. - My apologies Simisola, I did not want this to be a surprise to anyone. Is this a surprise for everyone? Good afternoon, everyone. I'm sorry this has not begun well. - It's nice of you to come see Tunde. - It's nice to finally see you again, son. Ronda, you are looking well. - Are you okay? - I'll be fine. I can handle this. - Tunde, would you get the rest of my things, please? Be careful with them. - So how long are you in the U.S.? - I will be here another week. I should tell you everything later on. - I wanna say sorry. - Don't say shit to me. - [Dipo] Simisola, accept my apologies, please. - For what? - You are upset with your brother and me. - Don't worry about it. I'm not upset with anyone. - That is refreshing to know. I hope you will join us later on. I would like to speak to you again. - I'll meet you in the back, all right? - How long did you know about this? - You think I wanted your father here? This is for Tunde. - Oh my goodness, this hasn't changed at all. - Well the swing set's gone. - Oh yes, I see. - Aye! - Congratulations, Tunde. - Thank you, thank you. - I remember when I put that up for you kids. When did you take it down? - Not long after you left. Come on. And all this is new. - Oh, yes. - All that. - Hello. - Hello Mr. Iberende. I'm Elsa, Tunde's girlfriend. I've herd so much about you. - Oh, oh it is very nice to meet you. - Tunde, why did you not tell me you had such a lovely girlfriend? (upbeat music) - [Ade] Oh, what's up? Haven't seen you guys in mad long, man. - I know, I've been centering, hey! How you doing? Papi, you remember Ade? - [Ade] Hey, man, what's up little man? - What up, what's going on baby? - I'm good, I'm good. - Long time no see, kid. - What up, Ade, what's going on? - Do me a favor, why don't you just park your car in the street because I don't want the driveway to be blocked. - All ready? Look around! We're the only one's up in this place. - I don't care, do it man, you take care of that. - Whatever, well if you put it that way, peace. - Ade, I can't drive stick. (foreign language) - It sounds like you have an excellent plan for your life. Perhaps you can help Tunde construct a plan as well. - Tunde has a plan. He's going to business school while I'm in law school. - Oh is that so? - Mm-hmm. - And why did you not tell me of this? - Well, nothing's definite, you know? - Well, it sounds like a commendable idea. You could learn something from this young lady, Tunde. Excuse me a moment. - What was that supposed to mean, "Nothing's definite?" - Why you tellin' him all my business? - I didn't know it was such a big deal. - No, it's not. I just don't wanna blurt it out to everybody, okay? - Sorry. - What's up, what you got goin' on over here, man? - Well, I ain't got to fajitas yet. That's what I ain't got goin' on. - Sando, why you gotta be like that though? - I'm just tryna say. I mean, you boys can grab some of them world famous hamburgers. - Let go of the first utensil. - Oh, give me that back. (beat boxing music) - I got something to show you. - Man, what you think I'm begging or something? - There you go, andale. - Good afternoon, mother, it's good to see you again. - [Grandma] Ain't got nothin' to say to you. - I would only like to say-- - I don't wanna hear what you like. You ain't got nothin' to say to me either. - Listen, mother-- - No, no, you listen. I didn't want you here in the first place. You just thank my grandson that you're here. We was better off without you. Tunde, Tunde, come and get this fool out of my face. - All right, dad, come on. - [Grandma] You should have stayed in Africa! - Grandma, all right, I'm sorry. - [Grandma] We was better off without you! - It's what he wanted. - Stop doing everything for him, just let go. - Simi, if you had wanted this on your graduation-- - Yeah, but I didn't. Mom, I don't think I can stay here. - Simi, no, please, wait! Simi, wait, please! - It's been 10 years. Why does she harbor all this anger? - Dad, don't even talk to her any more, please, okay? - Hey, grandma. - Hey, baby girl. - You okay? - That son of a bitch tried to talk to me. Do you believe that? After 10 years just walk up and try to talk to me like nothing happened. - Look, dad, I'll be back in a second, all right? - Ade, would you help me talk to your sister, please? - Just ignore him, all right? You look good. (laughing) - Hey, grandma, I'm sorry if dad made you uncomfortable. - You the one that brought that man up in here. Why you sorry now? - Simi, Simi, I won't say thanks for understanding 'cause I thought you'd be more, you know? - You thought what? You didn't think Tunde, that's the problem. Is this why I haven't been able to speak to you for the past week? - I was gonna tell you but-- - You were gonna what? You're real slick Tunde, real, real smart. You weren't gonna do shit. So why don't you just be a man and admit that? Who was there with you every night you used to cry yourself to sleep, huh? Was it him? And now you want him back in your life? - I'm sorry. - Where the hell has he been for the past 10 years, Tunde? And what has he done for you? Just get away from me. - Please, stop, okay? - Oh, so now everybody wants to speak to me now, right? - Come on, let's go for a walk. Come here. - Don't play me with me, Ade. I'm playing, I'm not playing. Come on, where you going, where you going? (laughing) Why you acting this way, hm? - Acting what way? - Hey look, it's Tunde's special day and he wanted to invite him. - Well, Tunde should have told me, all right? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Heard you were sick this morning. - Al just needs to stop telling y'all my business. - No it is my business. You gotta stop working too hard, Simi. You're killing yourself, seriously. - Yeah. - So you gonna come back in... For your big brother? - Whatever. - This was a mistake, Tunde. Perhaps I should leave. - No, no, no, don't, you can't go now, why? - I am not wanted here. - You know how mom and grandma are, what do you expect? - Yes but it is Simisola. - No, who cares about Simisola? - Do not speak ill of your sister, Tunde. - No, I'm not, I'm not. Look, I invited you here and I even asked everybody if it was okay. I even postponed the part 'till August 'cause I knew it was better for you. And look, I want you here, okay? And if they got a problem with it now then who cares? - It's not that bad. - Which side are you on, Janine. - It's not about sides Move on. - Janine, you didn't have these kids to raise. - All that and cancer? - That is old news. They caught it and you were, oh, that's the answer. - Do me a favor, Janine. - All I am saying is-- - And what are you saying? Well? - Never mind. (whispering and laughing) - I can't even believe you ate already. We bought and made all that food and everything. Steaks, we got burgers and everything. - Yes, I'll have something later. - God well you can't. - So you're staying, right? Simi? (party chatter) - [Man] What up, Simi? - What's going on? Simi, I know you got a lot going on up there. - Honey, I'm just really upset right now. I just need some time to calm down. So just don't push me, okay? - Are we going or? Simi, okay. (smooth music) - Oh my goodness, Mark and Boris? - [Mark] It's been a while. - You boys are looking good. - [Mark] Thought you forgot what we look like. What's been going on? - Where's Elsa? Better look out, you know she's been lookin' at me. - [Mark] We ain't seen you since you bounced. - Bounced? Bounced, what is bounced? - That might be a little bit too advanced right now. But that's okay, don't worry about it. - Do you want a burnt burger or hot dog? - Oh, no, thank you. Tunde, on the table I have some (foreign language). - Are you serious? - Word, that's what's up. You got the classics. (laughing) - Yo, sweat, get outta here! - [Tunde] Share though, share. We ain't had these since forever. - Please, make sure you share. - Share? - Save some for Jesus, man. - What about me? - Je-who? - Yeah, what about me and Lex? - You can get some later though but back to you. (foreign language) - Hey grandma. There you go. - What is that boy over there? Is that um? - That's Boris. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Sweetness, I don't know what I'd do without you. You hear me kid? - Thanks, grandma. - I don't know what I'd do with you. - Everything okay? - Yeah, you just keep that man away from me and everything will stay fine. - (mumbling) Grandma. - I like the pictures that you sent. - Oh, I shall have to send you more then. - Yeah, the one's on the beach were really nice. - Oh yes, Lakey Beach. - Lakey Beach. - That is very close to where I live. Annette and I usually go there with the children. It is very relaxing. It's hard to find a place like that in the U.S. - I know that's why I wanna go there. - What? What are you talking about? - Dad, last time we spoke I told you I wanted to get over there. - Of course, and I thought I told you that it's not a good time. - Ade, Ade you keep your eye on him. I do not trust that man. Hear me, keep an eye on him. - You never trusted him, grandma. - Baby, push me over there. I wanna see what they have on the grill. - I live in a very small house. I share two rooms with three small children. - I'll just find somewhere else to stay. - I shall not help you if you try to go. The government is in turmoil. It is not safe. I forbid you to go. - Forbid me? You can't forbid me, I'm not a child. - A child, no. My child, yes. I am your father. - Well, I just need to get out of here. - What are you running from? Why must you become so defensive? You're just like your mother. - What's with you two? - Your brother wishes to join me Lagos. (chuckling) - And that's funny? - I used to want to do the same thing. - And? - Well, I have responsibilities like putting you through college. - Oh, not this again, please! - Who do you think helped mommy out? It wasn't aunty, it wasn't Simi. - Ade, nobody's even talking to you. And dad, I've never even asked you for anything before. - Don't pressure him. - Is anybody talking to you? - Tunde, lower you voice. - No man, I won't, this is. - So you all right being back? - I had hoped not to upset anyone. - Tunde showed me your latest photos of your kids. So what's next? - What do you mean next? - [Ade] You had mentioned something about bringing the kids over. - How do you know this? - Tunde. I mean, that was the point wasn't it? - The point of this trip was to attend your brother's graduation party. - If you say so. - I am not a rich man, Ade. I must do what is best for my family. Things are not easy for me now. - I wish I could help you but I-- - Please, do not get the wrong idea. I would not ask you for anything. - Oh, Ade, can you play with me? Tunde said he was-- - Sory, Lex, I can't right now. I'm pretty busy, okay? Next time, all right? - Come, little man, I will play with you. (smooth R&B music) - Hey, baby. What's the matter? - Nothing. - So why you over here pouting? - These people get on my nerves. - Yeah, what's new? Come on, it's your party. Your dad's here, I'm here. - You miss me? - Mm-hmm. - A lot? - A lot. - You like your necklace? - I love it. How'd you know I'd like it? - 'Cause I know you that's why. - You better. What's up with this? - I look good, I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah, you look good. What's up? - Come on, let me show you something. - What? - Don't worry about it. (party chatter) - Youngin, you want anything? - No, I'm okay. (growling) - Can I play? - All right. Two against one, two against one? Oh! - Go, baby, go! - [Dipo] All right, I want to see your super duper, best super duper kick. - Super, duper kick. - How about your super duper kick? Oh! All right, high five. High five. Yes, you have tired this old man out. So you two are going to play, all right? - Okay. - Okay. (boys playing) (party chatter) - I hope you're not hungry. - What are you talking about? - My father's over there with the bafoons by the grill. - Girl, this is my house. I'll go wherever I please. - How are you boys behaving yourselves these days? - [Mark] We're doing fine. - We're all grown up now. (mumbling) - No. - We should meet up just a bit. - I am fine. - Did you bring your trunks? We're going swimming later. - No, no, no, no, no. - Come one. - Come here. - No, Tunde. - Come on. - Uh-uh. - What are you doing? - You remember the rules. - No, that was way back and it's not like she's gonna come up. - So. - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, guys. Can I have your best burger, please, well done? - [Mark] We don't have any at the moment, but if you come back in five, definitely gonna take care of you. - Good afternoon, Rhonda. - Hey. - I hope you're feeling better. - I'm feeling fine, thank you. - Excuse me, I, um, was hoping we could talk? Perhaps discuss a matter? - Discuss what, Dipo? - Well it's private. Perhaps we could go inside? - What could be so personal that we can't discuss it right here? - I don't want to talk about it here in public. But of course if you're not comfortable, I do not want to. - It's all right. Let's just go and get this over with. - Come on, stop playing. Stop playing, come on. Go, go. - So what is it that you wanted to show me. - What is it, Dipo? You want some? - No thank you. I must bring you some red wine. - So what's so important? - You know I love this house. I miss this neighborhood. - How would I know? - Coming back from Nigeria, this is an oasis to me. - Why were you giving me those funny looks before? - Maybe the looks I give when I'm excited, I don't know. - No, I mean when we were talking with your father. Did I do something wrong? - No. I told you, I just don't like people to know my business, that's all. - Fine, I'll keep my mouth shut from now on and let you keep all your little secrets. - No, it's not like that. It's just, look, I don't want him to think one thing and then he'll get disappointed if it doesn't happen. - Why wouldn't it happen? - Look, Elsa, I don't. Look, I don't think I wanna go to business school anymore. - All right, fine, you could find something else to do. - No, I wanna go to Nigeria. - Nigeria? - Yeah. - And what does that have to do with you-- - Because I don't wanna go back to school I wanna live there. - Excuse me? - Just for a couple years, you know? And then. - A couple years? I'm not going to no Nigeria. I'm not going. - I didn't say that. - I thought we had a plan. - No, you had a plan! - We've been talking about this for the past six months. You couldn't tell me this sooner? - No, I just wanted to tell you when I saw you. - And how long have you been thinking about this? - Look, Elsa, I don't even wanna start this now. - I don't care. You can't just drop this on me all of a sudden and pretend like it didn't happen. It does not work that way. - Look, my dad is here, come on. - It's my life. - Look, could we just talk about this later, please? Please, I mean my dad is here. I mean, I have all these guests. Come on, please. Please? - All right. - Okay? - I must confess, Rhonda, that I did not come here only for Tunde's party. I also came here for you. I'd realized that we have had some difficulties in the past but I hope that we are able to put it behind us. - Where is this all coming from, Dipo? - Rhonda, this is very awkward for me. I am in need of your assistance. As I have told Tunde on numerous occasions, I am in dire financial strain. Please, please, do not get the wrong idea. I am not asking for money, please, sit down. Please, sit down. I wish to bring my family here. - Where? - They can't stay here. - I did not ask this. First, I must find work so that I can save enough money to bring them to this country. In the meantime, however, I will need a place to live. Rhonda, if I may stay here in this house two, possibly, three months, just until I am financially stable? - I don't know about this, Dipo. I need some time to think this through. - I realize that we have a troubled history but I wish to make amends with everyone, especially you. I cannot stay in Nigeria long and I fear that if I stay, Tunde may try to follow me there. - He's already been away at school for four years, Dipo. - He has been talking to me about it for months. - Excuse me, no! - I have tried to explain the situation to him but he is stubborn and claims he will come no matter what I say. - I will talk some sense into that boy. - Please do, Rhonda, I would appreciate it. And concerning my stay in this house, I do not mean to rush you but, I need an answer by today. - Dipo, I, I can't give you an answer today. - Rhonda, I'm not in this country long. My fiances do not allow it. I have an appointment with a lawyer who tells me that my situation would be much easier if I had a stable residence. I do not know what I will do if you say no. - All right, Dipo, just let me think it over, okay? - That is all I ask. Thanks, Rhonda, thank you so much. - I'll see you downstairs, okay? - Okay. What are you looking for? - I'll tell you about it later. - [Ade] What's up with that? - Don't even act like you didn't used to do it. - What you got? - Don't worry about it, no, stop. - Suit yourself, man. - All right, all right, all right. - Where'd you get that? - I have my ways man. - You playin' it later? - Yeah, you know it. You think you can get mommy and Simi to play too? - Yeah, sure man, it'd be fun. Don't worry, all right? (upbeat music) - Wait, this is backwards. - I'm sorry, we have not been properly introduced. I'm Dipo, Simisola's father. - It's nice to finally meet you. - Oh god. - I'm Alex, Simisola's husband. - Husband? - Yes. - I did not know she was married. - One year next month. - I see. Yes, she was always a stubborn one. (chuckling) - I'm so glad I was finally able to meet you. - Please, if you don't mind my asking, what are your plans for children? - Things come all in due time. There's no rush. - I see. (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello. - Can you get away from him please? - What are you doing? Where are you? I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll get back to you later, okay? - Alex, come here, I need you now. - That's great, bye. - Fuck. - I'm sorry about that. Let me turn it off. Sometimes people at work, they never know when to leave you alone. - Oh, yes. - Hey, baby. Simi? Hey, babe, what's wrong? - Don't worry about it. - Come on, Simi, it's gonna be okay, honey. - Slow down, mommy, it's not medicine. - Hey, give me that back, Simi! You know, you ain't too old to get beat girl. You know what I saw out there? Dodo and puff puff. - Don't act-- - What? Come on Simi, they were your favorite as a kid. - Well I'm not eating that. - I don't wanna eat it alone. Please, please? - Fine, fine, fine. Just make sure no one sees you get it, all right? - Okay, thank you, sweetheart. - I'll meet you in the living room. - So you are a teacher? - Yeah. - Oh, what do you teach? - Actually it's writing. - I see, uh-huh. - And I see that she had a wonderful interest in the-- - I'm sorry, excuse me a moment, excuse me. - What are you doing with that? You should see what Tunde bought. - I think I seen enough for today, thank you. - I was gonna ask you for a favor later. - What, he wants to invite Alex's ex-wife over to make the reunion complete? - Nothing big, just something special. - Yeah, we'll see. - Hey, mom. - Hey, baby. How you doing? - Good. - Okay. Tunde, what's this I hear about you wanting to go to Nigeria? - Nigeria? - What are you talking about? - Don't play stupid with me. - No it was just something I was thinking about, that's all. You don't have to-- - Well stop thinking about it, okay? 'Cause it's not going to happen. - All right, mom, all right, whatever, all right? God! - Mom, don't let him talk to you like that. It's been so long since I've had these. They're actually better than I thought they were. - Are you kidding me? This is so good. Almost as good as sex. - Mom! - What? It's been just about as long since I had either. (laughing) (party chatter) - You see your dad? - Why? - Something's not right with that man. Running around here like a lost fool. - Hey, Tunde what's up with that? - I don't know, why? - Where have you two boys been? - We were just playing. - Have you seen my brief case? Where is it? - Yo, T, who died up in this piece? - Yo, what's up, man? I'm about to liven up this place. I need to get some real music up in this. Ma, you brought the CD? - Oh yeah it's in the car. - All right, I'm gonna go get the CD. - You live here, you don't have any CDs? - No, man , go inside, I don't know. - Yo, where's your car at? Let me go help him find the car. - I made it myself. Just taste it. Go ahead. - I don't trust you. - Why you don't trust me? It's good, right? (smooth R&B music) - You okay? - Of course, why wouldn't I be? - No, you looked real nervous before. - Thank you for your concern, Tunde, but I'm fine. - Look, dad, there's just something I wanted to ask you. - Oh, yes, yes. I was having a discussion with your mother earlier and I think it would be good idea if you came to Nigeria for a while. - Oh, so you do? - Yes, yes, I think it's important that you know more about your culture. - Cool, cool. Since we're talking about Nigeria, I wanna show you what I got shipped. - Oh, my goodness. Is this a Ludo board, where did you get this? - I wanna play with you guys later. - I remember you making us play that damn Nigerian game. It was worse than Dominoes. - Oh my goodness, (chuckles) Janine! It is nice to see you again. You are still stunning. Where have you been all day? - [Janine] I knew you saved the best for last. - Dad? - Well it's definitely nice to see you again. - Aunty Janine, men are kinda talking, all right? (foreign language) - Dipo, come dance. - I don't think that would be a good idea. - Dad, please, just for a minute. - Tunde, let me speak to your aunt for a moment, please. Huh? - Now I thought I told you I wanted a dance. - Janine, your mother is sitting right over there. - She's in a wheelchair, what's she gonna do? - It'll bring up too many memories. - I'm not taking no for an answer. (smooth music) - Do you wanna? - Do I wanna what? - [ Tunde] Do you wanna come dance with me? - No, I don't. - I don't know why you act like you don't wanna dance. You know you do. - Can you get away from me? - [Tunde] Come on, please, come dance with me? - No. - I'm sorry. - Well, you're gonna have to do better than that. - I'm sorry, okay, I'm so sorry. - No, stop, get away from me! - You gonna dance with me? - Fine. - Come on. (smooth rhythmic music) - Excuse me one moment. Ade, could you hold this for a moment? - Dipo, why the hell are you two talking? You've caused enough problems 10 years ago with that crap. Don't you think? It's none of your business so don't even ask. He's not to be trusted with anything, that's all you need to know. (smooth R&B music) - I think even after all this time, but you remember that as much I love them, I am nothing like them. - You are correct, apologies. It is nice to know that not everyone hates me. - It was a hard time for everybody. - This is very true. Thank you for understanding. - I mean, you suffered as much as anybody. I mean, having to live with a crazy, bitter, drunk would drive anyone crazy. - How can you say this? - Well it's true. - Has nothing changed here? - Not really. - Where's Boris? - [Mark] I don't know man, somewhere else around here. - All right, I need you to help me, come on. - I'll be back. - What's up with you today? - Can you stop? - Can you focus on me, please? You asked me to dance. - It's not always about you. God, stop being so selfish. - What's up? - Man, check this shit out. Look, can you pick a lock? - What kinda question is that to ask me? Of course. (smooth R&B music) - Elsa, just calm down, relax, all right? I'll talk to you in a second, all right? - No, no. This was a mistake. - Can we talk about this later, please? - Make sure you lock it. - Yeah, yeah. - All right. - [Ade] What do you need? - I just need a couple of tools. Nothing really hard. I just something, nah, it's too wide. Something slim, here we go. - No. - I'm sorry. - Now, it's obvious you don't want me in your life. You don't include me in your decisions and you don't respect me enough to see if I understand. - It's not even like that. - It is like that. You don't want a girlfriend. - Elsa, please, please, please. - But at least you didn't wait until I had three kids and breast cancer before you left me to go back to your jungle. - [Mark] I got it, come on. - [Ade] All right, come on, hurry up, I gotta give it back. - [Mark] All right, just give me a second. I got one already. - Good. - What are you doing? Why you got dad's brief case? - Don't worry about it. We're looking for something. - What you mean, you're looking-- - Tunde, stop! - [Mark] I got it, I got it, I got it! Stop, man! I got it! Come on, guys! - [Ade] Yo, stop, chill, chill! - Chill, stop! - Come on man! - Come on, man, all of this for a brief case? - I thought that you might like some of these things. - You know what this is? - You used to eat that all the time when you were little. - How'd you know that? - I know more than you think I do. - Oh, so you need to stop talking to Ade so damn much, yeah. - You okay? - Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing. - Excuse me a moment. Have you seen Ade? - No, I've been inside, haven't seen him in a while. - Ade, where have you been? - Tunde, what's wrong with him? - He's got issues. - Oh, look who's talking. You know, we still gotta finish that conversation from before. - What? - In the living room? - Mom, don't start, okay? Let's talk about it tomorrow when you're feeling better, all right? - I'm feeling fine right now. - Well mom, there's nothing to discuss, okay? - This is not a debate, Tunde. Your father and I don't think it's a good idea for you to go. - What are you talking about? I can do what I want. Ma, I got money, I got a place to stay. You can't tell me what I can and cannot do, all right. Look, ma, you know what, you know what? Whatever, I'm going, all right? Why don't you have some more wine. - Tunde! - Rhonda he's. (smooth hip hop music) - You have a month. - Thank you. - Why are you acting like this? - Don't act, you saw the same thing I did. - That didn't even mean anything. You know it didn't mean anything. - What do you mean? He's gotta go, Tunde. - No, I asked you if it was cool if he came here. You said it was all right. - I'm not cool with it. - Ade, this is my day, don't mess up my day. - That's right, it is your day, it is your day. You know, why don't you go off and find your girlfriend, man? Go have some fun. - At least I have a girlfriend. - [Grandma] Ade, would you help me over to the bathroom, please, baby? (coughing) - Allow me. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Alex, please. I need to see my daughter, huh? (smooth hip hop music) - Elsa, it's Tunde, please call me back when you get a chance, please? All right, I'm sorry. - Thank you. You still know how to open a door, huh? - You children were always getting into everything. I had to learn quickly. Are you feeling better? - Why'd you come here? - I wish to speak to you. - No, I mean here today, why did you come? - Tunde asked me to. - So? - He said he needed me so I came. - Well hasn't he needed you for the past 10 years? - Leaving you children... Was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Can't you see? (smooth hip hop music) - Stop, ma, come on, let's go. - Oh, there's my baby. - Stop, come on. Let's go inside. - It's my baby. Come dance with me. - Come inside. - No, sweetie, come dance with me. No come dance with me, please. - Ma, you need to stop, stop! - I got her, I got her, I got her. Hey, Rhonda, how you doin' honey? Come on, you've had too much of this, come on. - Get off of my arm. Stop pushing me. - What is wrong with you? You are making a scene out there. You're embarrassing yourself in front of all those people. - Leave me alone. I did something stupid, okay? I told him he could stay. - You're not making any sense right now. - I told Dipo he could stay for just one month. - You did what? - I don't know, I can't lose my Tunde. - How could you've of been so stupid? - I know, I'm stupid, okay? I know I'm stupid. - All right, you're just gonna have to tell him that you changed your mind. - No, I can't do that, then I'll lose Tunde. - You're not making any sense, Rhonda. - If he stays here, Tunde can't go over there. Do you understand now? - All right, Rhonda, you're gonna have to sober up because you're not making sense. - Just go away. - Is somebody in there? - Simi and your father. - What? - I need to get into my bathroom. - Alex, can you put grandma in the bedroom until they get out? I think she might be more comfortable in there. Thank you. - [Dipo] After your mother's operation, - Mastectomy. - After the operation, the way she drank, I tried to make her stop but you know your mother. - You still had three kids who needed you. There were no calls, no visits, nothing. - Your mother has assured me that you children would be better off without me in your lives. She told me to disappear... So I did. - Just leave. - No, I cannot go. - Look, I can't take this right now, okay? So please leave. - We must finish this. - I don't feel like talking right now. Look, I'm fuckin' pregnant, okay? Can you just leave me alone? - You are what? - I'm pregnant. - Tell Ade to come in. I wanna talk to him. - All right. - Hey. - I have to check on Tunde's presents. - I need to speak to you. - Look, I can't talk right now, okay? Maybe later. (lighthearted guitar music) - Everyone gather around. Gather around, could everybody gather around? I need everyone to gather around. I would like to take time away, I mean out of our very interesting day to celebrate my son's new stage in life. He's already looking to make changes. I appreciate the love and support you have given to me and my kids, besides today and-- - I just wanna thank everyone for being here tonight. Especially, my family, it's nice to see everyone. - What are your plans now that you're here? - You asked me this earlier. - No, I didn't. - I told you I have no plans. - You sure about that? I mean, come to the U.S with no plans? That's a little bit strange, isn't it? - It's my son's graduation, isn't that reason enough? - You tell me. - Why are we discussing this, Ade? - No reason. - Best gift for me would be for my family to come and have a game with me like we used to. Come on, come on. Come on, Simi, come on. - Would you stop? - No. - Ade is right, Simi, perhaps tea would be better? - No, I'm fine, this is fine. - No it's not fine. - [Rhonda] Ade, would you just let her have the wine, please? You're not her daddy! - I said, stop. - Guys, let's just play, okay? - Why are we arguing about this, huh? You know why I said no? Simi, do you think a woman in your condition should be drinking? - You told him? - He didn't tell me a damn thing. Keep your voice down next time you're in the bathroom. I heard everything you said. - Simi, right now, I need to know what's going on. - Ade, that was not your business to tell. Everything that happens in this house is my business. - So? What's going on? - I don't wanna have a family, Alex, not now. - But what about earlier? - I changed my mind. - Simi, Simi this is serious. When were you planning on telling me this? Were you planning on telling me this? - If I decided to keep it. - You can't make this type of decision without me. - Alex, there's nothing else to say, all right? - But what about me? - What about you? - Simi, Simi... Look at me. I love you. We're having a baby. We're having our baby. - Hey, aunty. It's been a night huh? - Mm-hmm. - Can I ask you something? - What are you trying to do damage control? - Look, I really just wanna talk with you right now. Did my parents ever get a divorce? - Why does it matter? - It just does. - Look, Ade, don't play these little games with me, all right? I'm not gonna tell you shit until you tell me what the hell is going on. - I think dad's tryna get the house back. - And this is coming from where? - Looked in his brief case, found some legal papers about the house and their assets. What is it? - He asked your mother if he could stay. - What are you talking about? - Your mother said he could stay here for one month until he got back on his feet. - She what? - She said he could stay. - Thank you, baby. - You're welcome. - How are you doing? I'm doing okay, mama. - Come on over here and let me see you. Girl, you need to stay away from that bottle. - All right, ma. - Mama, I have to talk to you please. - No, Ade, I'm busy right now. - [Grandma] She is too drunk, tell her when she's sober. - I'm not drunk! What do you gotta tell me? - Mama. - What? - Not here. - It's about, Dad, okay? - Not here. - Look, this is my house. Don't tell my boy what to do in my house. - Mom, don't let dad stay here. - What like it's some big secret? He would have found out about it anyway. - Janine, you are always doing the same-- - Mom, listen to me, this is important! Dad want's the house, okay? - How do you know? - I found some legal papers in his brief case about you and the house. Mom? - I told you, you should have divorced him. Why didn't you ever divorce him? - Janine, could you shut up for one second? Damn it, I don't believe this. He told me he wanted my assistance. I'm gonna give him my assistance and shove it up his ass. I'm gonna tell him to get the fuck out of my house, Janine. - Listen to me, if you do that, you'll never get him out of your house. Calm down and think about it. - I don't wanna calm down, Janine. - You can do this. - She's right, mom. - It so strange being back here at times. But I guess now I will have some time to get used to it. - Look, Dipo, I have to talk with you about something. You know with Tunde here and a new child on the way, just not sure if we're going to have the room for you to stay here. - But I will only be here a month. - I know but it's just not a good time. - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, no it's just there are going to be a lot of people running around here soon and I don't think I'll have the room. - What, Simisola doesn't live here anymore. - Tunde is talking of staying with my family in Nigeria. I don't take up much space. I don't understand. - I know Dipo but the house isn't that big. - I am asking for your help, Rhonda. - I wish I could do more. Sorry. - This house is still in my name. - It's in mine too. - I still have some right to this house. What I'm asking is not much. - No this ceased to be your house the minute you walked out the door, leaving me alone with three kids! - Rhonda, I need to get my family over here. - And? - Rhonda, I do not want to make things difficult for you but I will do what I must. Don't force me to take legal action. - What? - You leave me no other recourse! - Bullshit, bullshit! How about you and your monkey kids go find some other damn place-- - Rhonda, my family will stay here in this house or the house will be sold. I've already spoken to an attorney about this matter. - What are you talking about? Dipo, you walked out on us! - Well the law states otherwise-- - I don't give a fuck about the law. - Rhonda, Rhonda-- - No, do me a favor. Get out of my house. - Please, Rhonda. - Out of my house. - I do not wish for us to be this way. I and my family will stay in this house or the house will be sold. - Get out of my house! - Tunde, my brief case please. My brief case, just give me my brief case. - Dad, what happened? - Just get me my brief case, please? - Tell me, what happened? - Did you know about this? I told you not to bring him back here. (yelling) It's my house, get out and leave us alone. - Will you get me my brief case? - [Grandma] Why don't you leave? Just get out of our house. Just get out of our house! - Dad, it's not true, right dad? It's not true, just tell me. - Tunde, I am not going to stay here and explain myself to you. Give me my case. - Just tell me, you can't even just answer me. You're not taking it. - You son of a bitch, get out of my house! (screaming) - So today was just bullshit? - This was a mistake, Tunde. I shouldn't of have come. - You just came for the fuckin' house? You never came for me? - You do not understand. - No, I understand, man. This was never about me. It was just about you and your new fucking family. The fuck is wrong? - They are not my new family. They are my family. - Then what are we? What the fuck are we then? You son of a bitch, I can't believe you played me like that. - That is not the case. - Then what is the case? (sobbing) Did you ever love us? I never wanna see you again. (exotic music)
