THE PERFECT LOCATION Lift your arms up. OK. Here. Here. Excuse me! Can I step outside, please? I don't feel well. Can I have something to help me sleep, please? I'll give you a Tranxene. That should help. Thank you. Be brave. -I'm cold. Can I have a blanket? -No. There aren't any. I'm thirsty! Who are you? What? Who are you? Barbara. Are you here because of what happened in the prison? Yes. You too? Yes. I'm Bertrand's daughter-in-law. I don't know who that is. Who do you know? Michel. Michel is his friend. What's your name? Nathalie. Did they pick you up at your home? What a load of crap. I had to leave my little girl with my neighbor. What did you do? -I worked at the prison. -What? I used to work at the prison. Michel was in my group. Why are you here? Because I gave him money. In the visiting room? That guy is such a moron. Who? My father-in-law. He's a real moron. He didn't tell you what the money was for? Nothing at all. I thought it was for buying gifts. What did you do? Did you also give money? Yes. I didn't know what it was for either. It wasn't a lot of money. I didn't give a lot either. Pierre! This way. I went to the prison to make a movie. I wouldn't have come up with such an elaborate project and then screwed it up by trafficking drugs. That's ridiculous. What kind of relationship did you have? We had an epistolary rapport. Did you not write letters to each other? That's it. We used to write letters. Did he ever mention postal orders? Yes. Michel asked me to accept money from someone who owed it to him. -Someone in the prison? -Yes. -Did you receive it? -Yes. Tell me exactly what happened. He asked for an address so that a prisoner could deliver the money. -What was their name? -Whose? -The prisoner. -I don't know. What about the person who received the money? -Rita. -And her surname? She has nothing to do with all of this. -How much money did she receive? - 150 Euros . -And you give it back? -Yes. Well, not all of it. He only asked for 80. -Did this happen again? -No, that was the only time. COURTHOUSE Are you Barbara? Yes. I don't know why they're keeping you hostage. -Did you see Michel? -No. -Have you seen Nathalie? -Yes. We were brought here together. How is she? Not so good. Really not so good. This is crazy. Barbara Vidal. Hello. I'm Counselor Durieux. You will probably be sentenced to prison. That can't happen! Michel Vaugier stated that he gave you a watch. Is that true? Yes. OK. Make sure you tell that to the judge. This is absolutely crazy. -Got a cigarette, sir? -I don't smoke. Miss! Miss! Got a cigarette? There are some in my purse. -Where is Vaugier? -Over there. Not that way! Take the steps. So you bought her a watch. -Yes. -How much did it cost? -The watch? -Yes, the watch! -EUR 80. -Barbara said it was 150. I've never spent 150 on a watch. -But Barbara gave you EUR 150. -And I gave her back 70. -Why? -Because I only needed 80. Have I answered all your questions? Can I see her now? Take this. How many? -Just once. -No! How much money? -EUR 80. -You mentioned EUR 150 earlier. She received 150, but I only gave Michel 80. -Why? -Because he only wanted 80. -Why? -I don't know. What a generous man Mr. Vaugier is! Did you know what Mr. Vaugier would do with that money? No. You never thought of asking him? He asked me to do him a favor. You don't ask questions. Not even in prison! You should! Especially in prison. Prison is exactly where I should send you. That's what the state prosecutor requested. Your Honor, you wished to question her about the watch. Of course! Mr. Vaugier gave you a watch? Yes. Sign the statement and then you're free to go. Does that mean I can never see him again? Or write to him. Sign here, please. -Is anyone going towards Paris? -No. -Do you have the time? -It's midnight. Thank you. ONE YEAR LATER I started writing 2 letters, but I couldn't finish them. I couldn't find the right words. I don't know what to say. I'm so afraid of screwing up and saying the wrong thing. I prefer to give up. I want it to come from the heart. My own words for your eyes only. Kisses. Slow passionate kisses. Our mouths in constant contact. My arms around you. My body pressed close to yours. My legs intertwined with yours. Skin on skin. Our gazes interlocked. I love you. My love, your letter is finally in my hands. Thank you for finally allowing me to read a real letter after all these months without any updates. It pains me to not to be able to write to you. I can't wait until the day I am allowed to. At home, sometimes the interminable silence is broken by my dog's sighing. I often think this is the sound of a letter slid under the door so I rush to the door, but to no avail. I think I'm going crazy. I love you, Michel. I love you truly, madly, deeply. I love you and only you. Always and forever. You alright? What's in your head? You? Huh? - Me? - Yeah. - Well, you. - Really? What are you thinking about? Well, about that. What? Mom? -They can never see each other? -No. Not for the past year. But they can write letters now. -Can they call each other? -No, they're not allowed to. Are they getting married so as to see each other? It's because they love each other. Fetch me the bouquet, please. They might not want to get married after seeing each other? Don't you think getting married in prison is a little sad? No, it's not sad if they love each other. -Why can't I come, then? -Only witnesses are allowed. It's not a party. If it's not a party, then it's a little sad. Will we give Barbara her gift today? Yes, we will. Ms. Meyer. Ms. Vidal. Mr. Simonin. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Gather round, please. Gather round.
