How silly it is... to hold tight to something that's vanishing. I can't bear to say goodbye even after waking up from the dream. I won't move my eyes from you, so I won't ever forget you. (Someday or One Day: The Movie) Li Tzu-wei, come over here! Li Tzu-wei, you're really ridiculous! I've been calling you. Why didn't you pick up the phone? Didn't you say you'd show me the design drawing for the shaved ice shop's new sign? Where is it? Dude, don't tell me it's not done yet! I gotta go to Tainan today. Relax. It's already done. Where is it? In order to change your idea, I didn't go to bed until daybreak. You owe me overtime pay. In your dream. It's your responsibility. Have you been in contact with Chen Yun-ru lately? No. Why are you asking? Nothing. I gotta clean up now. I have a meeting with a client in a while. Hey! Did you ask them to add sugar? - Of course. - Love you. Hi! Classmate! Your wallet. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Come over here! Hi, can I get a bubble milk tea? No tapioca, milk or tea. Sure. It'll only take a while. Make sure to put it into three cups for me. Tsk-tsk, Huang Yu-xuan! What the heck are you doing? I have 20 take out orders to fill. That many? Stop messing with me! I would've come later if I'd known. What song is that? Wu Bai's Last Dance. You like it? Not really. I was listening to this song in my dream. But I never heard it before. You never heard it before? But you were humming it earlier. I know. I never heard it before but I kept hearing it in my dream, so I know how to sing it now. That's weird. What's more is that in my dream there was this guy listening to the song with me. Who was it? I have no idea. I don't know him. In my dream, it seems like I'd known him and been with him for a long time. Sounds romantic. What happened next? And then we went to lots of places. We lived, moved, and listened to music together. We did a lot of, a lot of... What? Huang Yu-xuan, you had a wet dream. I didn't! Stop talking nonsense! Hey, you said you went to lots of places, lived, listened to music, and moved together. That wasn't the way I told you! - I didn't do that! - Excuse me. - You even closed your eyes. - Excuse me. May I ask you a question? May I ask what song you're playing? It's Wu Bai's Last Dance. Okay. Thanks. Can I get a bubble milk tea? Regular sugar and little ice. That'll be $40. Oh, sure. Excuse me. Do you have an older sister? What? Please don't take it the wrong way. I'm not hitting on you. You look like my high school classmate next door. That's why I asked whether you had an older sister. I don't. That'll be NT$40. You don't have an older sister. Okay. What can I get for you? I want a... I want a bubble milk tea. Regular sugar and little ice. A bubble milk tea with regular sugar and little ice. Regular sugar. Little ice. Huang Yu-xuan! A regular sugar sweetheart. - It'll only take a moment. - Sure. Stop talking nonsense. Regular sugar sweetheart? It's nothing. Don't listen to her nonsense. There you go. Your bubble milk tea. Thanks. You're here later than usual, so the ice has melted. My treat today. Then let me treat you to a late-night snack. You don't need to do it. I'll see you at 10. I'll see you at 10. What are you looking at? Come here! - Is it good? - Hmm. It's pretty good. - Glad you like it. - But I still think Tainan's braised pork on rice tastes better. Lin Braised Pork on Rice. - You know it? - I'm from Yongkang. Anping is close, so I went there often. I remember when I bought Taiwanese churros at a shop, there was a little girl near me. She looked like she wanted to eat the churros. I later found out that she got separated from her family. I was going to call the police. But she said, "I don't want police!" And then burst out crying. I ended up taking her with me to find her family. What's wrong? The little girl you were talking about... was me. It was you? Look. You looked prettier when you were little. I drew these four pictures. Seriously? You drew all of them? I did. Does this look familiar? - There's a piece of driftwood! - Hey! To welcome 2011, the international fireworks master Cai Guo Qiang is in charge of the Taipei New Year's Eve fireworks show. He'll create the most glorious New Year Eve with thundery fireworks. Aren't we watching here? Trust me. Do we have enough time? The countdown is coming. Don't worry. We have plenty of time. Watch out. Right here? Yes. Welcome. Watch your steps. Wow! I can see it clearly here! Right? Hold on. I got something even prettier for you. - Do you like it? - Hmm. It's so pretty. I... I want to tell you something. It's about time. Actually... Tell me later. Okay. Because... it's my first New Year Eve with my boyfriend, and I don't want to miss it. Your boy... friend? Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Watch out behind you. Watch out for the steps behind you. - Take it slow. To the left a little bit. - You went over too much. To the right. A little bit to the right. I'm so drained. Why are we looking for an apartment on the 6th floor? I... What are you doing? Hey, Li Tzu-wei, she really isn't Chen Yun-ru's younger sister or relative? - You also think they look alike? - They look very alike. Listen, they don't know each other. Their personalities are totally different. - She's more hot-tempered. - Really? - What did you say? - See. Alright, introduce yourselves to each other. Hi, I'm Mo Jun-jieh. I was Li Tzu-wei's high school classmate. Hi, I'm Huang Yu-xuan. The person you were talking about really looks like me that much? 200%. 200%? She was the one you mentioned when you hit on me? I wasn't hitting on you. Look. Look at this one. - She really looks like me. - Right? Was she your first girlfriend? She wasn't. We were just classmates. And the one who loved her was... - the one sitting next to me. - Stop your bullshit! Alright. Isn't this kind of awkward? Don't worry. She's 30 something and you're in your 20's. She's super quiet and you're super outgoing. Not to mention, you have a mole here on you face. - She doesn't have one, does she? - No. She doesn't have a mole. Exactly. Plus, she didn't get mad as easy as you do. - Who gets mad easy? - Go ahead and beat me up. Okay, save it for later. Eat first. Eat now. Let me cut it for you. You're working overtime again. Hmm. I am. The case is a bit urgent. So I gotta work overtime to finish it. What happened? I had a nightmare. You had a nightmare? Hmm. What nightmare? I don't remember it exactly. I only remember that in the dream you were holding me tightly, but then vanished all of a sudden. Don't worry. It's just a dream. I'm not going anywhere. If you have another nightmare, just hook my pinky. That'll tell you it's just a dream. Morning. Morning. Hey, I'm in a bad mood today. Can you tell me a joke? You want a joke? Sure. One day, meat bun and... Please! Not another lame joke about meat bun and noodles. Listen, this one is really funny. - After meat bun and steamed roll... - Never mind. I gotta get ready for work. - Hey! - I don't want to talk to you. That's the latest customer analysis report for Guang Shi Technology this quarter. Lisa, thank you for your time. Evangelina, you're worthy of your reputation. Her excellent work proves your leadership. You're too kind. It's Yu-xuan who's talented. I can't take full credit. It's the result of our joint efforts. I'm confident that you'll increase our team's coastal customers. Please send Yu-xuan's recommendation info to me ASAP. Lisa, we've forgotten the time. Don't you have a flight to catch? - Let's go. I'll take you to the airport. - Sounds good. Yu-xuan, I'll see you in Shanghai. Evangelina, get it done as soon as possible. Make sure Yu-xuan hands over her work before going to Shanghai. I thought the case would be completed this week, so I took Chang's case. I didn't expect our customer in Germany would propose another revision plan today. I was caught off guard. I'm really stressed out. Hey, I have something to tell you. What is it? I might be transferred to Shanghai... for at least two years. That's great news! You should've told me sooner so we could celebrate together. Don't worry about how I feel. You only need to know that... no matter what decision you make, you have my full support. What if... I miss you? When I miss you, I always listen to this song. Thanks to this song, I got to find you. Lisa is on a business trip. She asked me to help you out. - Here, it's your badge. - Thanks. This is the Planning Department. Don't loaf on the job. This is your Development Department... and your seat is here. I'm rooting for you. General Manager Yang, let me introduce our new Development Department product manager. Hi, I'm Huang Yu-xuan. Welcome to our company. I'm Yang Hao. Lisa mentioned you to me. I'm very interested in your ideas on dating records and personnel matching conditions. Let's chat when you have time. Thank you, General Manager Yang. General Manager Yang, it's time for the meeting. I have a meeting to go to. I'll let you get to know the office. (This is my future office desk. Isn't it great?) Look at my lunch today. It's your most hated dish noodle soup with vinegar. Three, two, one! Say cheese! Let me see! Let me see! Hey, what are you doing? Check in with your boyfriend? I'm familiar with long-distance relationships. It's the same for my wife and me. You guys also live apart? We did before we got married. I'm from Shanghai, and like you, she is also from Taiwan. Really? How did you meet each other? Was it work related? I was on a business trip to Taipei in 2001. I met her while I was there. But it ended before anything could happen. I couldn't get her out of my head after I came back. And then one day, I had a meeting in Huangpu, and ran into her in an elevator. Such a coincidence! She happened to come to Shanghai? She did. She said she was sent by her company. She ended up going to the wrong building on her first day of work. Your chance meeting sounds like it was fated to be. I guess. Everything was so coincidental. I don't think it was all coincidental. Perhaps both of you wanted to find each other so you ended up together. Do you think so? I do. Let's go. Let's go sing. ♫ I'm not discontented ♫ ♫ I just want to be alone and happy ♫ ♫ I've come to a realization ♫ ♫ How indifferent I have to be to not be afraid of pain ♫ Morning. Ah, that's not right. It's 7 in the morning here, so it's evening there. So, I should say evening! Evening. Now I just want to tell you that... I dreamed of you when I was sleeping. I miss you so much. Wait for me. Get it? Yu-xuan, it's been three years. If he's still alive, I don't think he'd want you to give up such a great opportunity because of him. I don't know why. When Na told me about the news, you were the first person I thought of. This is great news! You should've told me earlier so we could celebrate together. What if... I miss you? On July 10... Don't you remember the accident that day? When you fell off the under-construction building, and Tzu-wei fell off as well... while trying to save you. I dreamed of you when I was sleeping. I dreamed of you too. I miss you so much. I miss you so much too. Today, you'll fly home in the evening. I'll see you very soon. Wait for me. Get it? Hmm. Morning. Oh, that's not right. It's 7 in the morning, so it's evening over there. So I should say evening. - Did you have a nightmare? - Hmm. Don't worry. It's just a dream. I'm not going anywhere. Huang Yu-xuan! Huang Yu-xuan! My anticipation drifts in the dark. She's 30 something, and you're in your 20's. She's super quiet and you're super outgoing. Take the umbrella. You laugh in that world... while I stay silent in this world. Your voices can't be heard here. The light in my eyes can't shine through. Where am I? But you have become a landscape in my world. Where am I? While I've become a picture on your wall. Hello? Chen Yun-ru, the editorial meeting is almost over. Aren't you supposed to propose a plan today? Where are you? Are you coming over now or not? Did you hear what I said? Hello? Do you hear me? Chen Yun-ru. Chen Yun-ru! Didn't you agree to leave with us? You always leave by yourself every time. She really looks like me. Right? She's 30 something, and you're in your 20's. She's super quiet and you're super outgoing. Not to mention, you have a mole here on you face. - Chen Yun-ru doesn't have one, right? - She doesn't. I'm Chen Yun-ru! How can I be Chen Yun-ru? July 8, 2014. July 8. Yu-xuan, it has been three years. If this is not a dream, I've returned to the time before the accident happened. So... So... Chen Yun-ru? What happened? Calm down. Talk to me. Help me. So you're saying I'll die on July 10 and Yu-xuan will fall off as well? Yes. Chen Yun-ru, can you stop messing with us? I... I know you won't believe me. I know what I said sounds ludicrous. But I'm not Chen Yun-ru. I'm Huang Yu-xuan. If you're Huang Yu-xuan, then... Mo Jun-jieh, I saw your interactions with Chen Yun-ru from her memories. The Chen Yun-ru you remember didn't talk like I do, right? She didn't, but... And you! Li Tzu-wei, never mind that he doesn't believe me, how can you not believe me? It's me! Hello, it's me! Even if I've changed to another person, I'm still me. How can you not recognize me? It doesn't work that way. Yu-xuan is right here. Yes, she's Huang Yu-xuan. But she's the clueless Huang Yu-xuan from 2014. But I'm the Huang Yu-xuan from 2017 and have gone through a lot. I don't know why, but I also have Chen Yun-ru's memories. I know very clearly that I'm not Chen Yun-ru. I'm Huang Yu-xuan! I... My god! Alright, why don't you calm down first? Oh, I got it. You took me out for a late-night snack on our first date. You ordered noodle soup with tons of vinegar. I accidentally broke the ruler on the drafting table in your studio. You were very mad at the time. I'm sorry. When we watched "Fight Back to School", you cried in the bathroom for half an hour. What were you crying about? It's the last part. Hey, hold on. That's not the point! Man, I've said so much and you still don't believe me? Huang Yu-xuan, I know what I said is hard to take in. You'd believe me if you were him, wouldn't you? Even if you were tricked by me, you have nothing to lose, right? No matter what, we can't let Li Tzu-wei die... because only you know... how sad you will be after he dies. Only you know... how you feel... going back to the empty house. Yet, you're unable to leave... because it's the only place where you feel... he's there with you. Please believe me. Can you stop walking around? You're making it hard for me to work. I'll get some late-night snacks. Will you be okay going out by yourself? No problem. It's not that late. ♫ My anticipation drifts in the dark ♫ ♫ Your serene face is reflected with brilliant colors ♫ ♫ How can I not adore you? ♫ Mo Jun-jieh. Mo Jun-jieh. What are you doing here? What happened? Nothing. I'm just getting some fresh air. Let's go in. Okay. She's sleeping. Hey, where are you going? Shush, be quiet. I'm going home to wash up and sleep. What else do you think? But I've promised Yun-ru to keep my eyes on you. I'll tell Yu-xuan to keep her eyes on me, alright? There you go. For you. Let's get out of here. Open the door, Li Tzu-wei! How long are you going to wait here? Why are you here? Weren't you upstairs? I could see you up there. It's not hard to escape from your spying. - What is this? - I got two late-night snacks. This is for you and please bring this one to Yu-xuan. - I need to go to my studio. - You can't! I'll tag along. I said I'll stick with you until July 10th. I'm speechless. Dude, you can come out now! You suck at hiding. I have no problem spotting you. I wasn't spying on you. I worry about Yun-ru's safety. How about Mo Jun-jieh go with me? You're not lying? I'm not. You've stalked me for two days. One more day won't make any difference. Like you said, we'll talk about the rest after tomorrow is over. - Keep your eyes on him. - Okay. Come in and join me. Sure. Thanks. How come they didn't include forks? I'll get them. Can I ask you something? What is it? Things that will happen in the future. Li Tzu-wei. - What? - Do you have time? Sure. Can I see the drawing you did for my grandma's shaved ice shop? The Grandma Mo's shaved ice shop drawing? Where did I put it? I think I put it in the storage room. I'll check. Why do you suddenly want to see it? Do you want to copy the style? Mo Jun-jieh. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Didn't I say I'll stay here all day? Why are you locking me in? I know. But we worry something might happen. I'm sorry. Just treat it as your day off. I've prepared bread and water for you. Try to put up with it. Try to put up with it? Anyway, you'll be safe after today. You're dead after I get out. Don't worry. The July 10th you dread will be over in a few hours. We're the ones who should worry about what we'll say to Li Tzu-wei if nothing happens after midnight. He definitely will be very pissed. Let him. As long as we can change the future and he can live through today, nothing matters. What's wrong? Nothing. I got a text message from my friend. A friend? Is it Kun Bu? Yes. Sounds like it's urgent. I'll call her back. Hey! Don't go too far. I won't. I'll be just outside. What have you been doing after graduating? I told you already. I'm not Chen Yun-ru. I'm Huang Yu-xuan! But didn't you say that you have Chen Yun-ru's memories? I did, but they're very blurry. Very blurry. I just want to know what happened to her. Remember to call me after you arrive in Taipei. I'll visit you on my day off. Hmm. Bye. A car just drove past. Take care of yourself. You came home less and less because of heavy schoolwork. And I couldn't go to Taipei to see you every week. In our conversations, more and more, you talked about friends I never heard of before. And I could only tell you about my dull life. I'm sorry I was late to Wu Bai's concert. Later, I went to the record shop where you worked part-time and saw you and your friend talking about the concert. I was happy that someone went to the concert with you. (I'm sorry I was late yesterday. I'd like to apologize in person.) I just want to know about you and that guy... Hold on! Do you hear the noise from the storage room? Where is he? We're screwed. Where's Huang Yu-xuan? Where did Li Tzu-wei go? Could he go to that place? Hey, where's the place? Why is Li Tzu-wei doing this? Why doesn't he answer? Is it here? Yes. The entrance is over there! Hurry! Li Tzu-wei! Li Tzu-wei! Li Tzu-wei! Chen Yun-ru! I don't see him. - I'll check over there. - Okay. Where's Chen Yun-ru? Li Tzu-wei! You... You... Listen to me. Chen Yun-ru! Calm down. She isn't... Be careful! Chen Yun-ru. Trust me. The outcome will only be different if I disappear. Trust me! Chen Yun-ru, don't! Huang Yu-xuan! Grab my hand! Hello. NO! Huang Yu-xuan! Huang Yu-xuan! Huang Yu-xuan! Yu-xuan, are you alright? I need to take the day off. Where are you going? Do you really have no idea what happened? Why didn't you tell me? Three years ago, right in front of my eyes, Li Tzu-wei fell off the building and died. It was really painful to accept. We had to keep it from you. You... It's you. After Wang Quan-sheng woke up in the hospital... he told me everything. I then realized that what Chen Yun-ru, which is you, told us was true. Actually, you aren't the only person... who wants to change the future. The future Li Tzu-wei also wants to change it. Wait. I don't understand. The future Li Tzu-wei? What do you mean? In Li Tzu-wei's time, you and Chen Yun-ru... fell off the building on July 10th. But in the present we are in now, you and him were the ones who fell off the building. After Li Tzu-wei lost you, he was deeply depressed. Yu-xuan, why is the future you mentioned different... from the one I am in? After you left, Li Tzu-wei visited me at the hospital. I want to know if you've found any clues from when the future me was inside you? I remember... I was in a boundless space where I... watched fragments of your memories. Did you see how I returned to July 8th? I think... it was through a cassette. A cassette? I thought I could finish the case this week. I didn't expect our German customer would propose another revision today. Should I... tell Chang that I don't want to take the case? (It's Yu-xuan's birthday. Don't forget to buy a gift.) You want a joke? No problem. One day, meat bun and... Hey! Stop that! Listen, this one is really funny. You'll laugh out loud. Since after meat bun and steamed roll have a fight, meat bun gets very sad. He's heartbroken... but he tells himself not to cry. So he endures it. He keeps enduring it and holds back his tears. Do you know what he turns into eventually? He turns into a soup dumpling! Don't you think it's hilarious, Huang Yu-xuan? Let me out! Take a shower, Wang Quan-sheng! I'm... Wang Quan-sheng. July 8, 2014. Chen Yun-ru! What are you doing? You... Calm down, alright? Chen Yun-ru! Could you please calm down? If Yun-ru is really Yu-xuan who's returned to 2014, I'd be the one who dies in her time. But in my time, she's the one who dies. If I'm Wang Quan-sheng in the present, then the other Yu-xuan is... Let me out! Why does Chen Yun-ru want to meet me here? Where's Chen Yun-ru? Li Tzu-wei, Listen to me. Chen Yun-ru. NO! You must believe me. I'm doing this for your sake. The outcome will only be different if I disappear. Huang Yu-xuan! Huang Yu-xuan! Li Tzu-wei! Li Tzu-wei! After Li Tzu-wei died, I went to see Mo Jun-jieh... and told him everything. Li Tzu-wei drew this in 2017. Look. If he and I can't escape from the accident, how about Chen Yun-ru? Where is she now? Do you know? I've been looking for her for years, but I still can't locate her. However, about a year ago, I saw her in the picture of her with her friends. But I still don't know where she is. I think she's deliberately hiding from us. Yun-ru, you're really back! - So what you said is true. - I'm not Chen Yun-ru! I'm not Chen Yun-ru. I'm Huang Yu-xuan! I'm sorry for what happened earlier. What's going on? I went to work in Taiwan. I was living in Taipei at the time. I liked to go to a record shop... where Yun-ru happened to work. I'd like to buy this. This is your third purchase this week. - Do you like music a lot? - You have lots of records here... We both loved music, so we became friends. One day, I ran into her when I went to a Wu Bai concert. Hi! - Hi! - What a coincidence. You're here for the concert too? I'm waiting for my friend. The concert will start soon. Please enter as soon as possible. Ticket-holders, please enter as soon as possible. If we don't go in now, we'll be locked out. Why don't we go in first? I'm fine. I'll wait for a while. You go in first. Like what I told you, we didn't know each other for too long, and then I returned to Shanghai after my work in Taiwan was finished. - Although I left her my phone number... - You guys go first. She never called me. Sorry about that. When I thought I'd never see her again, we ran into each other once again. Chen Yun-ru! Yang Hao. Shanghai Disney is going to open soon, would you like to go with me? But I'm afraid of roller coasters. However, I can ride the merry-go-round. Have you eaten? That's not the right way to say it. Did you mean to say... That's very different from what I said. I practiced for a long time here. - You practiced for a long time? - I did. Let me take you to a great Shanghai cuisine restaurant. Then... How do you say "Have you eaten" in Shanghainese? We say, Wuhuxinong? Wuhuxinong? Wuhuxinong? What does that really mean? It means I like you. Turtle raise. You lose. I promise to work hard and make a good life for us, so please marry me. At the time, I really felt that I was the luckiest man in the world and our wonderful life would last forever. To provide her a better life, I worked really hard after getting married. I worked overtime, attended meetings, promoted products, socialized with customers. But I neglected Yun-ru's feelings. - Chen Yun-ru's family. - I am. I'm sorry. We did what we could. We couldn't save the baby. After that, Yun-ru went into a deep coma. Seeing her lying in bed with tubes all over her body, I regretted... that I ran into her in the elevator. I shouldn't have chased after her. I shouldn't have met her in the first place. Have you received the cassette? In her diaries, she said she met another self, whose name was Huang Yu-xuan, and who had a more optimistic outlook on life. I didn't know what she meant... until I met you. You and Yun-ru look identical. I realize that... everything she said in her diaries was true. I fell into Huang Yu-xuan's world, a world in which she looks just like me, but lives a different life. Last dance. One more chance. The content of her dairies came from your memories. You returned to the past after listening to this cassette. It didn't work for me, no matter how I tried. In the end, I let Yun-ru listen to it. I really have returned to 2014. Chen Yun-ru, What happened? Could you please calm down? So you're saying that you're not the Chen Yun-ru we know, but Huang Yu-xuan who's returned to present from 2017 after listening to a Walkman? Can I ask you something? What is it? Things will happen in future. Actually, in the future where I came from, I don't remember... what will happen tomorrow. I thought... as time goes by... There you go. Let's eat. I might remember something, but it never happened. I still can't remember anything. I suddenly realized that... it won't make any difference, even if I remember what happened that day. He's not coming back. How silly it is to hold tight to something that's vanishing. I can't bear to say goodbye even after waking up from the dream. I won't move my eyes from you, so I won't forget you. I've never let him go. I lied to myself he didn't die. Morning. Morning. I lied to myself that he never left me. If I can't change the reality that I'm alone in this world, at least, I can hide in the dream where we're together. Is it a dream? Why do you become a reality in my dream? Perhaps death... is the real dream? You're Chen Yun-ru, right? I'm Li Tzu-wei from 2017. We still have time to stop it. I'll call her back. Perhaps there's only one way to stop it. If meeting me causes you to end up like this, I wish I never met you. If I disappeared from this world, all of this won't happen. If I didn't exist at the time, no one... would suffer any loss. Yun-ru! Yun-ru! Don't scare me, Yun-ru! If you can really go back to the past, please save Yun-ru. I beg you! I can't. I'm sorry. I couldn't even save the person I wanted to save. Nothing can be changed. Don't lie to me! - Let me go! - You just don't want to help me! If you let Chen Yun-ru go back to the past, she'll suffer even more. What do you mean? Even if she goes back to the past, she'll only want to kill herself. This is the cassette that took you to the past. I failed to save her. So... Even if we find the way to the past, we can't change what happens in the past? It'll stay the same no matter how many times we try. Huang Yu-xuan! Be careful! As long as I exist here, it means Yu-xuan hasn't survived. We both couldn't accept losing each other. I wanted to save her... while she wanted me to be the one who lived. I don't want her to suffer repeatedly. I just want her to live a good life... in a world where I don't exist. Li Tzu-wei, we can't change anything no matter how hard we try, can we? Yu-xuan, that's not true. We did change something. At least, I'm able to say good-bye to you. You had a nightmare? Hmm. What nightmare? I don't exactly remember it. I only remember that in the dream you were holding me tight, but then vanished all of a sudden. Don't worry. It's just a dream. I'm not going anywhere. (2014.08.12 - One month after the incident) I wish I could be brave. Just once. Chen Yun-ru. I'm so sorry. Thank you for taking me to the hospital. You saved my life once again. Hey! You! Hey! Classmate! Thank you... for stopping me that day. Actually, Mo Jun-jieh and I have been looking for you. I didn't expect you'd show up. This is the time drawing done by Li Tzu-wei. I can't find the sequence of the events. I can't find a way to solve it. I've been living in fear since that day. I've tried to piece everything together in my diary, but my memories got so blurry. I can't tell what's real and what's not. What can I do to change the future? Should I disappear from this world? Don't be afraid. We'll come up with something. I only hope that one day... this world will be different. It will be. That day will come. That day will come. I saw it in my dream that Huang Yu-xuan went back to 2014 after listening to this cassette. You scare me to death! What took you so long? - Is it because of this? - Yes. It's broken. You just bought it. No matter what difficulty I encountered, I thought I could make it through... as long as he was here. I didn't expect he would die. He didn't leave. I believe as long as he lives in your heart, he's still here. No beginning, no ending. To love. To lose. Changing the future will change the past. Cherish every moment we spend together. This time will be different. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I don't want this to happen either. I was at the airport already, but the situation came up unexpectedly. It's out of my control. So? So... I was forced to book tomorrow's flight home. Tomorrow? You aren't coming back today? I'm not. Hey, how can you do this to me? You promised you wouldn't miss my every birthday. - I know. - You're breaking your promise. I'm so sorry. I can't do anything about it. I'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow, alright? Yu-xuan, don't be mad. Yu-xuan! I gotta work. I'm not talking to you. Don't bother to come back tomorrow. Bye. What is it, Na? - Are you busy? - No. I'm not. It's nothing important. I just want to tell you... when I went to a restaurant with our client, we talked about the new collaboration. I wanted to show them how great we have managed their page and their huge number of followers. I was so mortified when I showed them the page! Na, could you please get to the point? The point is... ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Such an over-the-top birthday celebration. This is so showy! Thank you! Happy birthday. Make a wish! Alright. Here comes my first wish. I wish everyone has top sales performance and receive a huge end-of-year bonus! And my second wish. I wish all of you good health. You might as well say you wish for world peace and that everyone is environmental warrior. Shut up! Yu-xuan, for your third wish, you must close your eyes and say it silently. My third wish... Huang Yu-xuan, happy birthday. Marry him! Marry him! Would you like to be Mrs. Li? I would love to. That's enough kissing! (Tis better to have lost and loved than never to have loved at all) What are you doing? Hi, General Manager Yang. Lunch break is over. Time to go back to work. Sorry about that, General Manager Yang. I'll be right back. Wait. You're a fan of Wu Bai too? Yes. Today is the day to snap up his concert tickets. So I... Me too. I've been a fan of Wu Bai for a long time. Go for it. Yun-ru, what a coincidence. Yes. What a coincidence. I'm sorry... I didn't get to see the concert with you all those years ago. I didn't get to see the concert either. I'm fine. I'll wait a little longer. Why don't you go in first? Okay. Would you like to hear the concert with me now?
