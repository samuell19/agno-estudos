Run, run! They are going the ceiling surface! Throw in the same quadrant. Ah, JC! Has some trouble we gets, that is wondering ... how did I get here? Double guerrillas on the roof. M46 aircraft with two targets in the crosshairs. In my case, the reason is always the same. Janaina. For her smile ... I am able to face an entire army. - Not the first time I do it. - Lie down and wait ... The arrival of ... militia. Lie or be slaughtered. I'm afraid. Living without knowing the past is walking in the dark. How do I know? I know why I'm alive almost 6oo years. I've seen too much. I can tell. When I was born, Brazil was the name of a tree. My name was Abeguar. I was a tupinambá Indian. The tupinambás born to be warriors. I mean, a tupinambá not born warrior ... we became a warrior on the day he killed an ounce. Alone. You're crazy, Susan? What are you doing here? Did not know Abeguar hunted sitting. The smell of that leather around ... can attract one ounce in fact, its crazy. I'm an ounce. Janaina ... - Do not move. - Oh, okay, Abeguar ... only this game I ever did. Calm. Walks slowly. After you pass for me, you run. Okay. Calm. Slowly. And now? There is no escape. Climbs on my back. Ra. Oh, Susan, for. I'll never forget that feeling. To this day I can not understand how it all happened. If I knew the price would pay for that flight. Do you know why you fly like a bird? Because the great God hath chosen thee Munha. But he did not give you that power for nothing. Munha gave you a mission. Lead our people to land without evil. Nobody can serfeliz while his people goes pro abyss. This land will be dominated by Anhangá. Soon forests will disappear. The waters will be rotten and infected ... with snake venom. Animals and Men will die of thirst. But for all this pain and destruction ... you must keep fighting against Anhangá. Always. No matter what happens, you could not give up. You can not die. Should lead the eternal struggle of men against the Empire of Anhangá. And you will have to learn how to do this. Because only when you learn ... you will get to fly again in human form. Drink. See with your eyes such is the kingdom of Anhangá. See! See how the kingdom of Anhangá! Abeguar ... Abeguar! You have been chosen to be the big boss tupinambá people. Our Pajé insists with these old stories. What good Abeguar fly like a bird ... if whites have guns spitting fire? Tomorrow is a big day for tupinambá people. We will attack the Portuguese and its allies in Bertioga. I think we need consult other chiefs ... and whether they are in agreement. I am the great chief tupinambá! Villegagnon is our friend and asks for help. Let's help! The Frenchman is there the service Anhangá ... the spirit of the shadows. All that French there either brings destruction and death. Abeguar should speak with more respect. We will attack Bertioga tomorrow. That is my decision. The tupinambás should remain united. Abeguar dares to challenge the boss Piata? So should leave today our village. I, Piata, am the greatest tupinambá chief. For those who would be chief, eh? Sleeping rough, eating root. You want me to do? Nobody Piata faces. Everyone just wants to know of French goodies. How can I? Why this? There's something there. You think you can fly again? Shhhh. Oue. Stop it! - What is it? - O Abeguar there! You can not Bertioga attack. Munha showed me in a dream. This will attract hatred of the Portuguese ... and unite the tupiniquins a major attack against us. Abeguarfala a coward. His words are the daughters of fear. We will attack and eat our enemies. Get it right this bird it brings bad luck. Get that trunk forward. Fast! Get it right front, we will. Piata is tupinambá! This is my thigh, gives here. So I like hick. Want a piece? No, merci. It's mine, it's mine! Here, you can eat. My people would not listen. They followed Wills Piatã and his French buddy. Ate the bravest tupiniquins, as always. But also ate several Portuguese. The Paje said that the white meat did not feed our spirit. Anhangá fed. But nobody listened. Why the face monkey tied? 're Not happy side Janaína? The Shaman said I have get back to the village. If you want to go back, we back. Abeguar will never be alone. Where he is, even in a thousand moons ... Janaina will're always with him. How healthy is my tupinambá. What's this? The Portuguese came from the sea with a scary squad ... and attacked the French ships. Just like Pajé feared. I asked the help of Munha to arrive on time. But Munha abandoned me. Tupinambá is brave! I had to watch Anhangá's victory. I could not imagine how he was starving to death and destruction. I gathered the survivors ... and took him to the top of the mountain. In the end ... the war between the French and Portuguese that came from the other side of the world ... eventually decided the fate of our people. Well the place that was our village ... The Portuguese founded a village ... and named it San Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro. Abeguar? The kids have had enough. Still can not stop. Here, they can still reach us. So you'll have to leave children behind. See if you can find some dry firewood. Here for you too. Are you thirsty? Here you go, come all ... Ahh. Shaman? Tupiniquim! Abeguar! Portuguese! Abeguar! Here! Janaina! Janaina! Ahh ... Can not escape any of them, have another group fleeing. We need them alive. The children tupinambás were taken as slaves. Were working on plantations sugar the Portuguese. The tupinambá nation was decimated. Completely disappeared the face of the earth. I gave up everything ... first. The body of Janaina, falling ... covered in blood ... is the most pained remembrance I bring ... in 6oo years. Munha not let me die. Turned me into a bird. The impression I have ... what is knocked wings for several days. My body ached from hunger and thirst ... but I flew ... always ... nonstop ... as if one could escape. After nearly 2oo years living in the northern forest ... never see us ... I encountered Janaína ... the body of another woman. The spell was broken at the same time ... and I became the man happier world. My nigga gorgeous. We had two daughters. We lived the baskets I made and would sell at the market of Caxias. Is anyone hungry around? - I'm. - Hmm. Gives in the mouth? Balaio, you need is sleep early ... instead of staying at dawn around doing not know what. The time of the rain're going and you do not put garden bean. We purchase beans at the fair. And how to buy? We'll have to pedirfeijão spun my dad again? This year the sale the baskets will improve. Ê daughter is getting her balaio very cute, see? Very good! Very good! Who's been here? Who is? - Are you Manuel Balaio? - Am. The Cosme're camped a thicket near here ... 20 runaway slaves. Sent asking if you can get a few beans. Grab a bean bag there, Susan. Thank you! Vamo. Vamo. Vamo. No beans, we'll eat what, Balaio? We give a way. What a beautiful huh, Dad? So whitey ... It's cotton, silly. Hi Hi! Why do they use these currents, Dad? They are slaves, dear. Her grandmother was a slave when I was your age. But one day, she fled. Whoa! So you are not slave. Go, go! Vambora. Everyone falls. Fast. Are only two foremen watching the slaves at night. I left the canoes there on the river bend. Good luck, Cosme. Go with God, Manuel Balaio. Whoa! It's alright, alright. You're too late, my friend. At that time, the fair Caxias 're almost done. It is an order. Really? Guys, looks all there. These here, we will stay with them. Coppers are two dozen. Would be two coppers, I was paying. But those are for the government here. Will, can follow. Go, go away. Ah! Then ... the princess plunged into the river ... And how could she breathe down there? - She could because ... - Balaio! - It was magic, ué. - It's time to get, Balaio? And the girls in the serene all night, man? You do not have any sense. Hi, Mom. Comes. We was at the fair, Mom. Come heavy rain there. How do you know? Because there is heavy cloud, o ... and the wind will bring it over. Why the wind will bring it here? Why? Because a little girl who lives here ... did pee in her wake yesterday evening. But it was so little. Oh my holy! What's this? Arise, black! You're facing Captain pro government! - Come here, come here. Comes with its mother. - Mom .. What the police want with us? I heard that the people here at Ladies ... Walking helping the niggers of the Quilombo. Answer goat! 'm Asking you! Who said that to you, lied. Nobody here has nothing to do with Quilombo business. Are you sure? I grabbed a maroon nigga walking around with a bag of beans. I cut both his ears ... unfortunate but did not say who gave! When I find out, I'll bleed the goat very slowly. Look, that wealth. If the people here in Manga Walking helping Cosme ... - What? - I think it would be fair ... also help the government. Alas, alas! The captain needed here goes. Takes her hand! Loose it! Let me go, dog! - Loose it! - Mom .. - Solta my daughter! - Mother! - Solta my daughter! - It comes soon! - Mom .. - Solta my daughter! - Ouch! - Solta my daughter! - Help, Dad! - Let go of my daughter ...

Enough of this government get the leather people. Who does not have a firearm, trazerfacão can, hoe, sickle. Once the sun comes up ... I'm waiting on the big stone. And if anyone does not come ... I'm going alone. You must guide your people ... in the fight against the shadows of Anhangá. Balaio? Only you, my friend? No. .. has more people there that their Balaiada. This coffee're cold, what the fuck. Ô goat, put a little this coffee there pro their captain. And see if you do not delay. Wait, wait. Listen. What's this? Has any worm therein. Here, you will see there. So, coward? Comes. It's you and me. Our fight with the government brought people from every corner. - Carinana, Ray ... - Inte tomorrow. Seven Stars, Raimundo Gomes. The bravest cowboys Maranhão come fight with us. Tava whole world weary of seeing the government only pulling sardines ... the side of the farmers. Carinana, how many horses do you have? Hundred. You think you can get more? Can. And you, Ray? Get beasts? Some 50. Oooo. To which we must honor the presence of Don Cosme? I came to fight that his Balaiada. It has around five thousand blacks in the woods around here. Tamo ready to fight. Then it was time. Sure, Balaio? Caxias they're just police. Azar police. The broth poured, Raimundo. That everyone tired being trampled by the government. It's time We take the Caxias. Where do you think you're going? Did not know you threw so well. Neither do I. The fight was tough. Were three months with battles almost every day. But we Caxias. I felt that this time Anhangá had taken the worst. Oh man dancing. The situation is very serious, gentlemen. The empire is threatened. Lost Control of the Northern Provinces. The rebels took Caxias. A bunch of miserable, thieves of all kinds ... the scum of the country. Do not forget, gentlemen ... that, in Haiti, blacks expelled Napoleon's troops. The time this country came have a real army. Excuse. Ah, got our man. Colonel coffers are open to you. Spend whatever it takes ... but give an example to these people. Cavalry! Forward! Fire! Fire! We fled Caxias and split up in smaller groups. But Colonel Luís Alves ... divided his troops in several wheels ... and began to chase us on many fronts simultaneously. - Mother? - Mom, you hurt yourself? - Father! - Ah ... Janaina? - Ah ... - Janaina, please. Are you okay? Arise, my love. Come with me. Talk to me. Colonel Luís Alves Lima e Silva ... was awarded the title Baron de Caxias. Years later, he was promoted to Duque de Caxias. Made many statues for the great peacemaker hero ... Known as Patron Brazilian Army. I'll distract them, there you flee the background. Run inside the bush. Understood, Susan? Janaina, are you listening? - You know what I said, kid? - Ahem. Leads his mother inside the bush. - No looking back. - Got it. Will work. Dartudo goes right, my love. After the cannon ... Janaina never could hear nothing. She and my daughters were arrested ... and sold as slaves. Say, who is born in freedom, not survive in captivity. In a few years, three died ... yellow fever and malaria. This must be worth balaio one tack. This is just our war a date in the history books. Nobody says that Carinana, Seven Stars and Ray ... escaped and were wandering the hinterlands ... and there was born the highwaymen. Was the way the class which is not lower his head thought ... to continue fighting. We can not let establish the power of the word. The government harass. Can not turn our backs the National Union of Students. We have the right to freedom ... Censorship is immoral. It is a nonsense ... Janaina! I spent 13 years Janaina looking. It took me so long to find and arrived late. The military had taken power and started a dictatorship. He had no freedom. Who does not obeyed, was arrested, tortured and killed. Janaina was on the Democratic Action ... movement resistance students. I went into the same group. The dictatorship does not let us choose the book you can read. Again, the weaker side. But the twinkle in her eyes ... Have no freedom on ... gave me the certainty of being on the right side. The military found our group. We had to hide ... turned and guerillas. Drugs.
