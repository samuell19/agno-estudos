Hey. - Hey, why are you at the studio? - How do you know where I am? - I have an app that tracks you. - Well, that's creepy. - No, no, darling, it's not creepy. I'm your manager, it's my job to look out for you. - No, it's your job to get me gigs. - Is that what this is? Is this a gig? Did you book a gig without telling me? I still get my 10%, you know, right? - I came to visit a friend from the movie. - Well, the wrap party is tomorrow night, it couldn't wait till then? - I'm not going to the wrap party. - Why not? - Because I'm only in the opening of the movie. Okay, look, I'm, I'm tired. I, I just, I wanna go home. - Long day on set, right? - Goodbye. Fuck. Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. Apology for startling you. I'm Wyatt, the new overnight security here on the premises. What brings you on the property, miss? - Hi, I, I, I'm Alexis. Um, I'm just, I'm visiting a friend from the studio. - The movie studio, really? I haven't met anyone from there. So, uh, so you're an actress or something? - Um, yes. - Wow. So what have you been in? Been in anything I might've seen? - No, probably not. - Test me, I'm a bit of a film aficionado you know. - Have you seen "Amityville"-- - Yeah, Ryan Reynolds. Dude's a beast in that. That was a great movie. - I was in "Amityville Pregnancy". - Oh, I haven't seen that one. Any good? - Should have been aborted. - I like your humor. All right, well, I'm gonna make the rest of my rounds. I just was checking if you were okay. - Appreciate it. - I'll be back. Take care. - Thank you.

You may have noticed that there's no crew members here. Well, other than me, the writer and the director. But you know that. And let's be honest, it's the two most important crew positions anyway. Am I right? I'm just kidding. Tough crowd. Anyway, the crew was fantastic. Under my direction they did everything I asked them to do, and that's what a good crew does. They support the vision completely, and they did. So much so, that they're all currently working on a film in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Thanks to my lovely wife. - They're all amazing and do deserve equal credit for bringing your vision to life, dear. - Absolutely. I wish they could all be here, but I'm glad that you're all here. I'm sorry I couldn't allow you to bring anyone with you. You'll know the reason soon. It's the same reason why I had to take your phones when you arrived. No leaks allowed. But before that, let me share something with you. Filmmaking is... not an easy undertaking, especially on the independent level. It's been my dream since I was young to make film, to be able to stand here now and know that I've succeeded is mind blowing. I, I really appreciate all of you. And I especially want to thank Harper for all of her hard work. It was a physically demanding role and she put everything she had into it. And then last but not least, I want to give a special shout out to Alexis, who couldn't be here tonight. She may only have been in the opening of the film, but those scenes set the tone. She's the Janet Leigh, Drew Barrymore, and Amanda Wyss of this film. Her death was the catalyst to my dreams coming true. And now I'm gonna make your dreams come true. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our teaser trailer. - You fucking heard of mistress? - So many people have died there over the years. - Just kidding. Come on, celebrate my movie. Yeah. - Well, here's to us. - To us. - I think you are going to be very famous. - I don't care about any of that. I just want to do good work.

I'll do anything to be a star. - Oh, okay. - So, why don't you work on some no budget films or take some acting classes, gain some experience? - Fuck that.

You know, the one I starred in? - Oh, aren't you the cocky cunt? - I'm confident, brutally honest, and I know my value, which generally means people think I'm a bitch. - So now you're going for little sisterly bonds, woman power shit. - We should be working together and supporting one another but that doesn't happen. Women are the first to talk shit and play catty games. Well, I don't play games. I'm blunt and I'm honest. Yet, that gets looked down upon. While you pretend to be nice, your best acting performance by the way, you're the real bitch behind the scenes. I mean, how many people have you killed tonight? - Oh, I didn't kill anyone, dear. It was the slasher. I'm a victim just like you. But between us girls, I'm totally aroused. - So where is he? - Darling, it's your time to shine. - Oh, hi Mason. Now that you've finished whatever the fuck that was, why don't you take off your mask and face me like a man, you pussy? Oh, god. - Now you're trying to figure out who it could be. You've seen a lot of bodies. Who's left? Time for the big reveal. - Surprised? I told you I'd do anything to be a star. I'm finally going to be a famous actor. I'm gonna be on the cover of, of magazines. I'm gonna be on all the talk shows. You wanna know why? Because Lily and I are gonna be the only ones that survive tonight. This movie's gonna get so much press. I'm gonna become internationally known. I'm gonna have paparazzi coming after me from everywhere and I'm gonna have my pick of women. Yeah, but I only fuck models. Maybe some actresses that wanna be in my movie but... Oh, maybe I'll, I'll fuck them in my private jet. I've never been in a private jet. This is so exciting. I've earned this. I deserve this. I worked my ass off. Such a shame you won't be around to see it. So, Miss Stuck Up Bitch, what do you have to say about that? - At a thousand dollars a line, I'd say you owe the production like... 15 grand. - Make all the jokes you want. This plan is foolproof. Once you're dead, I'm gonna put this costume back on the extra that we hired tonight and all the murders and the evidence are right on here. Told you... foolproof. - You must not be a fan of forensic TV. - I hate that shit. - And that's why it didn't dawn on you that they'd be able to tell that the first one killed, was your supposed killer. - Is that true? - I decided to cut him out. - Yeah, he sucked. - Ruined the fucking trailer. - You never did answer me. Why are you doing this? - I've been in so many terrible productions and I never complained. You know, I, I put my head down. I did the work. I paid my dues. I've earned a break. It's my time now. I deserve to be an A-list actress. - That's it? That big speech. - The tears in the rain speech in "Blade Runner" was only 42 words. - Yeah, but each word was perfect. And you aren't Rutger Hauer. - Okay. How's this? You're right. The roles have dried up for me. Throughout my career, I spent so many nights alone and crying. Some of the pain is physical. You think you have it hard now, try being an actress in my generation. The things we had to endure. The leers, the groping. Sometimes... so much worse. This industry... takes a piece of your heart, with every rejection. But you handle it. It's part of the life. You find a way to keep going. Sometimes it's like taking your rapist out for breakfast in the morning. You endure. But you never heal. It's wounds, always there, festering reminders of all the times that you weren't good enough. And I'm one of the blessed ones. I have a husband, who's a director and he owns his own studio. That's not why I married him. I married him because I loved him and he loved me. At least he did. And then he started sleeping with all the other actresses. Just became another one of the people that I loathed. Was no better than all the others who mistreated me. Oh, what could I do? Divorce him? I'd have nothing then. I, I'd be right back where I started and I will not allow that to happen. I've given up too much of my life. Too much for this industry. Yes... the roles have dried up, but so have the tears. So now I spill blood. And why not? Those in power have enough blood on their hands. It's my time now. It's my time. - Hey! I work in the same industry as you. I'm used to getting stabbed in the back. - You okay? - She... - I am now.
