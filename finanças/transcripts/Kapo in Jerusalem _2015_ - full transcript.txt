Hey! Hey, are you crazy? I told you not to drink, right? There's no water there! Go on up. Who is it? -Buchman. It's alright, Mr. Buchman, I'm sorry. Good night. Shhh... Shhh... Mommy's coming. Bruno really loved this Nocturne. He kept asking me to play it over and over. When I was liberated from Auschwitz, my hands were rigid. Arthritis. Only a year later could I play again. Bruno would massage my palms with almond oil really slow... nice and slow. I never heard anyone play Chopin with such desire for life. It's alright, keep working. -It didn't fall here. Yaakov, get up. There are many wounded in Ramat Rachel. The Jordanians have a flame-thrower. By tonight they'll burn down the entire kibbutz. -Back to work. Oven, this is 4. Come in, 4, do you copy? Yaakov, go back to work. -Mortar shells are falling nearby. After the Jewish Council set up the health ward in the ghetto, he was assigned to the hospital on Chista street. I ran the local pharmacy. He was an excellent surgeon. In 1942 he joined the Jewish underground. They'd train in our basement. Sarah couldn't play the piano anymore. She'd come and assist him. On hot days she'd stand beside him during a surgery and wipe the sweat off his forehead. She'd console him when he lost a patient. Dozens would die each day, and he needed comforting over each one. Yes, Tilda? Yes, the secretary has left. I'm not cold. Yes, the fireplace is lit. So sit by the fireplace in the living room and light it. The matches are on the mantel. If you wouldn't call me every five minutes, I'd be home by now. After Sarah was sent to Auschwitz, he caught the two Jewish policemen who captured her during the roundup. To save on bullets, he broke their necks. When I arrived in Auschwitz, I was made assistant to the registration officer. I could've stayed in that job, but a week later, an SS officer shot the block leader because the morning roll call started late. The prisoners themselves offered to appoint me for his position. They knew I was a doctor, and that I was in the underground. They thought I could defend them against the Germans. Yes, I was thinking about myself too. About Sarah. I had better chances of survival doing this job. I wasn't naive. I knew that a block leader is part of the killing system, but being surrounded by so much death, I realized I had to pretend to be part of this system so I could save whoever I could. In my block we had a carpenter who worked in the women's camp. He told me she was still alive. I'd send her notes from time to time. When we got to Jerusalem, Bruno started working at the Heath Service. We had the wedding at Dr. Dubnov's yard, who was then chairman of the Medical Association. He was Bruno's teacher in Warsaw. On the day of the wedding, the British imposed a curfew. Bruno was stuck at the clinic and couldn't leave. Dr. Dubnov sent over an ambulance to get him. My groom arrived at the ceremony in an ambulance. A few minutes later, a postman arrived with a congratulation telegram from the conservatorium. The telegram was addressed to me, Sarah Reich. When he saw Bruno, he started yelling out that Bruno had tortured him when he was his block leader in Auschwitz. Hearing that, the rabbi decided not to perform the wedding ceremony. Bruno didn't argue. God hadn't been on his side in Auschwitz. He didn't need Him at his wedding either. I open the gate, take out the telegram, hand it to the bride and suddenly he's there standing right before me. I fainted. I just... What is this monster doing in Jerusalem? I was sure that... that he fled to Argentina with the Nazis he worked for. He was the biggest sadist in Auschwitz. The first night we arrived, we got off the train and... there he was. It was so crowded on the platform, that I'd lost my child. I lost my child. I run around yelling for him and he hits me with his club. He hit a son helping his father stand on his feet, hit a sick elderly man, hit a woman... By morning he had killed five people. Bruno Kaminski was my student at the Warsaw medical school. An outstanding student. I liked him even though he was a communist. He came from a poor family. His father died when he was a child, and his mother had a fish stand at the market. He'd wake up early every morning to help her. When we immigrated here in 1932, we lost touch with him. And one day, six months after the war, we heard a knock on the door. We embraced. He said that after what happened in Auschwitz, human civilization had to be reestablished, and here in Jerusalem, on purpose. I arranged a job for him at the Health Service and he... We didn't know Sarah, but we'd heard about her. She was a wonder child in Warsaw. At the age of 12 she was already playing with a symphony. I hit prisoners the night they arrived. When I heard about a transport from Poland, I waited on the platform, looking for friends. But as soon as they set foot on the ground, it was like a strike of lightning, with shouts in German, dogs, whipping. Families were torn apart. Their belongings were taken from them, their hats, shoes, clothes. Babies were thrown onto the trucks. They didn't understand the SS orders, if they were supposed to stand or walk, to turn right or left. If I hadn't hit them, they'd be shot. But I didn't kill anyone. I didn't kill. Those who died on the platform are the ones who didn't survive the ride. They're the ones who were dying in the closed train cars with no air, no food and no water. I didn't kill. While I was there, I got word of what Bruno had done in his block. At first I didn't believe it, but I kept hearing more rumors. Our block leader would also whip prisoners, she'd sell their food for vodka, for cigarettes, for soap. After the war... After the war, when... when Bruno came to visit me at the American army's hospital, I didn't want to talk to him. I told Sarah about it. On the first day I visited her at the American hospital, I held nothing back. She was too weak to even blink. The next day I continued telling her. I continued day after day. For three months I'd feed her, bathe her and tell her. For three months she didn't speak. Doctor, my back is aching. I can hardly walk. Hand me the rifle. On Christmas eve 1943, one of the SS officers got drunk and started shooting in my block. It was a massacre. I fled from there looking for another block to hide in. No place would let me in. Suddenly I see him standing at the entrance to one of the blocks. He immediately recognized me and let me in along with 30-40 others. He knew that if he let more people in, the Germans would find out he's hiding them. So the ones he didn't let in accused him of working for the SS. Him? Working for the SS...? He hid sick people so they don't get sent to the gas chambers. He asked the registration officers to write down the Jews in his barrack as being younger, so the SS let them live. He urged me to sabotage the electrical system to disrupt the weapon production. He helped anyone who tried to escape. Lazer, your weapon. Take the pill I gave you. The ache go away in no time. Oven, this is 4. We can't wait for you any longer, over. They're bombarding them with cannons and shells. Soon they'll be attacking them. If Ramat Rachel goes down, the Egyptians invade Jerusalem. But... Roger, copy. I was scared of him, so I kept quiet. I went with him once to get blankets from the laundry room. On the way back we saw a young Czech girl escaping from block 24, the SS brothel. He covered her with a blanket and told her to hide in our block. She was in his room for three hours. Then he passed her on to his friend, the block 32 leader, who also... The next day I went down to the Health Service to tell his manager about him, about the man that he is. But he knew that I'm a poet and that I was close with the nationalists, he didn't want to hear me out. I went back to Dr. Dubnov. I told him: "Don't you realize "that if the Nazis kept him as block leader for two years, "then they must've been pleased with him?" No. He must have done some good work for them. No one listened. Zimmerman was a famous poet in Warsaw, but he returned from Auschwitz a different man. His entire family perished there. I had trouble believing him... But he wouldn't give up. He brought more and more survivors who also testified. My cousin was in his block. After the war, he wrote to us from America. "When he realized I had stolen the blanket off a dead prisoner "and used it to sew a lining for my jacket, "he beat me up ruthlessly." Yes, I'd hit prisoners even during food distribution. They'd attack each other like beasts. Sometimes stabbing people for an extra portion. Other block leaders preferred to spill the leftover soup on the ground to avoid chaos, but I instilled discipline to enable me to distribute all the soup, so in my block they ate more. And I didn't take advantage of my status. I could've eaten by myself, but I ate from the same pot with the others. One day an SS officer told me to bring over muselmenn from block 7 to fix the fences that collapsed in the snow. I told him: "They can't even move", and he said: "We'll see about that." He took a few pieces of bread and tossed them to the muselmenn. They crawled towards the crumbs. The ones who couldn't move simply reached out hoping that a piece of bread would fall on them. One dying man choked another dying man to steal a chewed up piece of bread out of his mouth. Do you hear the piano? It's calling me, "come to me, come to me." When I can't hear the noises anymore, I sit down and play and the noises dissipate. The screaming, the moaning and the cries. Sometimes when it doesn't comply, I bite my hands to keep myself from smashing it, ripping out its cords and running to lay on the train tracks. When the damned SS guards would wander the blocks, looking for a Jews to abuse, he'd place me at the entrance to the block and I'd sing to them: "Ring far out "Where blossoms sprout "If you find a rose about "Say hello for me." They'd stop and listen, and move on to another block. They didn't know this song was written by two Jews, Heine and Mendelssohn. Bruno tried to disprove the allegations against him. He brought witnesses to the hospital to tell me about what he did in Auschwitz, how he took care of people, saved them and protected them. But I knew these witnesses stayed alive because he helped them, that's why they testified in his favor. Go on, take the lentils and go home. Go already! I wanted to testify in his favor, but I knew it would cost me my clients. No other block leader cared for his prisoners like he did. He got us thicker soup from the kitchen. Every few weeks he'd get replacement clothes for us from the laundry room. Several times he even got us some underwear. He set up a shoemaking workshop inside our block. It saved our lives. Over there, death started from the shoes. If your shoes were torn and you started limping, you'd be immediately sent to the gas chambers. Those who accuse him of sending people to the gas chambers, don't understand how that machine functioned. Only the SS sent people there. Yes? -Got any eggs today? Do you have stubs today? -I'll pay you extra. Will you also do my time in jail? Go away. -Come on... -No, get out. The shop is closed. Go away. One day, when he sat beside me in the hospital, messengers from the Jewish Agency walked in and said they've got an immigration certificate to Israel for him. Bruno said he won't leave without me. They told him they won't have another certificate, but he insisted. He was a doctor, they needed him, so they issued one for me as well. He carried me in his arms to the ship and cared for me the whole trip. I said to myself, if he had any doubts about his actions in Auschwitz, he wouldn't immigrate to Israel. Shhh... Shhh... go to sleep, Booboo. Evil Shoshana is coming tomorrow, and you mustn't be tired. Go to sleep, shhhh... Good night, sleep tight. I also took bread from the prisoners. Once every two weeks when the SS gave me a list of people who'd be gassed the next day. I knew they didn't stand a chance, so I gave their bread to those who had a chance to survive. I also took their clothes and gave them to others. A good coat and shoes could prolong lives. So they hated me and cursed me, but it was necessary. Obviously the Nazis planned to terminate us all, but I set some rules to help the prisoners hold on. Most of them understood my intentions. They saw that my block had the lowest death rate. During the sail, I thought a lot about what Bruno did there. But also about what I did. I survived because when my shoe tore, I stole one from the woman who slept on the bunk above me even though I knew the sergeant would see her barefoot and shoot her. I stole clothes from a woman in the shower, stole a blanket from a sick woman, and pushed old women and little girls in the soup line. I stole a slice of bread from my aunt who had dysentery, though I knew she'd die of starvation the next day. She didn't die. The next day she stole a slice of bread from a woman more sick than her, and stayed alive. Had I been in his block, he'd beat me up. My aunt will remember that slice of bread all her life. After the war I met her on a ship sailing to Israel. Bruno took me for a walk around the deck, and she was sitting on a pile of ropes, fixing a torn coat. She saw me... and looked away. I counted them. 238 men from my block survived the death march to Mauthausen. Those living here, ask: "So few?" Those who were there, say: "So many." I waited. I thought they'd come and speak up. One time, I had a high fever. I asked him for an exemption from work duty. He was a doctor, he knew it was pneumonia, but he didn't exempt me. A flea? Get out. Out! Out! He knew there was no chance of survival in the sick people's block but if someone caught typhus he sent him there right away so that others don't get infected. When he got typhus, he didn't go there. He made us take care of him. My best friend Yanek Tauber caught it from him and died. Yanek! Yanek! Yanek! But for some there was nothing to be done. They lay exhausted on the bunks, without moving or speaking. They were too weak to crawl to the electric fence. After they died, I hid their bodies for a few days so I could give their share of food to those who had a chance. When I met Sarah at the American hospital, she was just like them. Her heart was barely beating. She wanted to... but I didn't let her. Only when she arrived in Jerusalem did she realize she was capable, capable of love. She said she forgave me. Lazer, come back here! Lazer! Yaakov, Eliyahu, quickly, open the gate! Eliyahu, clear the sacs quickly, before they butcher him! He's running straight towards the Arabs, they'll torture him and slaughter him! What about Ramat Rachel? -We'll get him back and head there. What if you don't come back? -Doctor, stay out of this. They need us more in Ramat Rachel. -What are you doing? Doctor! We'll save him from being slaughtered. -Doc, put down the rifle! Do you hear me? Put down the rifle! In early 1947, Zimmerman the poet asked me to testify at Dr. Dubnov's. I'd waited for that moment. I had plenty to say about him but I mentioned only one incident. In April 1944, the Germans started building new blocks in Birkenau. I was a construction engineer, they took me from the coal mines to work in the camp. One day it was raining. The work was stopped, and when I returned to the block I saw Bruno putting a coat over a prisoner's face and choking him. The prisoners knew I'd helped muselmenn die. They thanked me. The only one who complained at Dr. Dubnov's was a survivor who saw his son being shot dead by the SS. His name was Antman. I wouldn't let him leave the block to help the boy because I knew that the Germans would kill him too if he did. He heard his son moan all night. He never forgave me for that, nor himself. He stopped eating, stopped working, and when he was dying he urged me to help him die. I couldn't play God any longer. I told him to crawl to the fence. But he didn't have the courage. The next day he started eating again. That's why he blames me. Because of me he's guilty to this day. Antman doesn't owe me a thing, certainly not his life. I owe him. When I saw him eating and working, I realized that even at the pit of hell a man can remain a man and fight for his life. Antman ended up beating the Germans. They tried to take away his will to live, but didn't succeed. He was dying the whole night, outside by the door. Bruno wouldn't let me go to him, to cover him with a blanket, to wet his lips with water. I asked him how many people he'd killed. He thought a bit and said: "Five". He killed more. I picked up the phone and told him I'm calling the police, but he took it from me and said no judge could judge him any better than he judges himself. He asked me to think it over for five minutes and promised that if I still want to call the police, he'll turn himself in. Thank you. We had two Slovak Jews who planned to escape. Bruno got them some knives, clothes and some food. It was October 1944. They waited for rainfall, so they have better chances. One night I heard two muselmenn say that they'd give the Slovaks to the SS for some bread. I told Bruno. He interrogated them and told me to choke them. I could see he couldn't do it himself anymore, so I choked them. And the Slovaks escaped. To this day I think that was the best thing I've ever done and I thank Bruno for giving me the power to do it. In my block there were Kapos who kept alive the prisoners who begged to die. We called them "murderers". The Kapos who helped women die, were called "angels". The Germans didn't urge Bruno to kill. They wanted the Jews to be tortured as much as possible. Bruno killed in order to spare those poor people a few more days in hell. Had the Germans known this, they'd have killed him. I didn't choke them with a coat, only my bare hands, so I could see their faces. So that if they change their mind, I could let go. But they couldn't talk. They barely opened their eyes. Sometimes their eyes would slightly crack open. None of them were scared, nor regretted it. Their eyes were saying "thank you". Shlomo, stack it up high. Yaakov, take it easy. Go back to work. Oven, this is 4, do you copy? Over. If you're not here in ten minutes, we're leaving. Half the kibbutz is burnt down, they won't last long. You're still a baby, my child, but you must watch out for Mom. Watch out for her and look after her. When she's out on the balcony hanging laundry, when she slices bread with a knife, when she lights fire in the burner. When she cries. When she laughs. When she's silent. Shhh... "Go to sleep already, my beautiful Yankele "Close your dark little eyes "A little boy who already has all his teeth..." Come, we brought water. "Still needs his mother to sing him a lullaby?" Want some water? Doctor, don't you want some water? Let's go. Applebaum was 46, from Katowice. Tarnopolski was 42, from Kielce. Cantor was 40, from Bedzin. Zuckerman and Edelman were 38, from Warsaw. They were muselmenn. In Auschwitz I shortened their suffering out of mercy, but I also despised and hated them for giving up. Today, when I think of the gratitude in their eyes, I don't think they gave up. Nor do I think that they thanked me for preventing their suffering. They thanked me for giving them that brief moment to feel like humans again, who can decide their own fate. Them and not the SS. When my father died in that block, they threw his body onto the pile. I knew he had a piece of bread in his pocket, so I ran to get it. But some bastard realized that, and beat me to it. Bruno saw him and made him give it back to me. Call Bruno! Call Bruno over right now! I want to see him! -Calm down. -I want to talk to him! I want him to get me out of here. Bruno... Bruno! "Softly singing measures wing "Sweetly, through my mind "Ring out, little song of spring "Ring out unconfined!" When we'd return from work, Bruno would give us soup. Good, thick soup. One pot could feed 1.000 people. At night he would pass from one bunk to another and cure the sick, resurrect the dead. After hearing him out, I realized I just don't understand it. The evidence against him was very compelling but so were his answers. I couldn't decide whether he did it for his own sake or for the prisoners. Of course he wanted to survive, but in many cases he also saved lives. I couldn't decide on the matter. -It was a big mistake. Because he wasn't suspended, he fooled himself that his actions would be understood, so he could live here. I didn't fall for his charm. It was clear to me that he'd been corrupted by the power the Nazis gave him. I never trusted a communist, especially one who turned Zionist and immigrated to Israel. The Nazis weren't stupid. It's unreasonable to think that for two whole years they were convinced he was working for them, while secretly working for the Jews. Stop it, will you?! When I saw that Dr. Dubnov wasn't suspending him, I went to tell the press about what he did in Auschwitz. So "Haaretz" published a short story on the last page. It quoted one stanza from my poem "Our Graves" Here. "Here lie my father, mother and sister. "On this stone my wife's ashes have set. "The wind carries the dust of my son and daughter "Between these linden trees my soul hovers." Two days later, two British policemen came here and said: "You have tuberculosis." They put me in confinement in a hospital in Netanya. I did have TB. He was the only one who knew about it. One day I found the word "Kapo" written on my door at the clinic. The nurses were whispering, the doctors started enquiring, and the patients stopped coming. I was repeatedly asked: "Why didn't you tell the prisoners "to rebel or escape?" I once walked into a block with 400 political prisoners on death row. Two sentries were guarding them. I told them they should escape, that if 400 of them charge the gates, some will surely make it to the woods, but if they keep sitting and waiting to be taken to the gas chambers, nobody will survive. They didn't respond. They all kept to themselves, not out of fear, I believe, they were just hoping for a miracle. They heard from the Germans that the Russians had arrived, that the war will end soon, so they had no reason to revolt or escape. The main cause of death in Auschwitz was hope. When I saw he was still working there, I turned to the Health Service branch manager, but he told me he can't fire him without fair trial. So one morning, before the patients got there, I walked in there and wrote "Kapo" in black on his door. Rumors about the investigation reached the conservatorium. Both the teachers and students would ask questions. I heard them whispering behind my back. One day the director calls me over and... tells me she's cancelling my end of the year concert. She said it's due to the war, the Arabs' shooting. I told her other concerts weren't canceled. She said that sometimes it's possible. The next day they held a concert for a pianist who immigrated from Germany in 1933. When the audience entered the hall, I got on stage before him and played. He understood and waited. The director sat in the first row. When I was done, she applauded. She didn't dare fire me. I didn't tell Bruno. The Health Service manager said he wasn't going to fire him, but a few weeks later, Bruno told me he quit. He knew he'd be fired. He quit because he couldn't take all that suspicion. He ended up opening a private clinic in Musrara neighborhood, facing his apartment. I sometimes came to visit them. Unfortunately, I couldn't invite them over. One day, an Orthodox couple came to his clinic. The woman had a throat infection. When her husband saw Bruno, he became furious. I could hear him shout all the way here. He made us shave our beards and side curls, forbade us to pray and mocked us for not eating un-kosher food. One Friday night he entered the block and saw us praying. He hit us with his club and threatened us that if we don't stop, we don't get any bread the next day. "No God can save you, only I can. "So don't worship Him, worship me." "No God can save you!" he'd yell at us. No God can save us. On Rosh Hashanah eve he demanded that our rabbi, Rabbi Israel Mintz from Krakow, cancel all prayers, and told him that if he didn't forbid us to fast on Yom Kippur, he wouldn't give him the ointment the rabbi needed for the sores on his feet. When he saw that we all fasted, he sent Rabbi Mintz, may God avenge his soul, to the clinic in block 7. There they gave him an injection to the heart. When I saw that murderer in his clinic here wearing his white robe and smiling, my blood boiled. I grabbed the nurse's scissors and tried to stab him. Suddenly his wife walked in and started screaming. "No God can save you..." When we got home, we saw he was stabbed in the shoulder. The blade pierced through the robe and his shirt. I licked the blood off the wound, just like we did back there. I wanted to go to the police, but I feared that if Weissman is put on trial, it could persuade other Orthodox survivors to slander me. I knew they hated me. They never understood that I made them shave off their beards and side curls so that the Germans don't torture them, that I forbade them to pray because then the Germans would pull them out of roll call and make them do exercise in the cold and the rain, till they collapsed. They hate me because they're scared to hate their God. The God that didn't save them. It's much easier to hate me. I didn't go to the police, but I bought a gun. Doctor? If anything happens to me, send this to my parents, okay? Why are you giving this to me? If you survived Auschwitz, you must be a lucky man. Take it. When I heard about the attempt to stab him, I rushed to his clinic. The door was locked. He opened up only after seeing me through the peep hole. I told him he shouldn't risk his life nor Sarah's. I suggested he leave the country. I could've arranged a visa to England for him, but he refused. Had you told him the truth, he'd have left. -I did. You didn't tell him he's being ostracized, that there's no chance he'll ever be forgiven, that anyone who was in his block is waiting for a chance to kill him. I did tell him that! I should've acquitted him and cleared his name once and for all, but I didn't want to interrogate him. I just didn't. Because my parents and siblings and their children, were all there. I didn't want to know how they were tortured, how they were murdered, while I was here, in Jerusalem. After the liberation, he immigrated to Israel. I stayed in Europe with several other survivors. We had a list of SS men who worked in Auschwitz. Eventually we met up with some soldiers and officers who'd been discharged from the Jewish Brigade. We killed off many Nazis. In April 1946 we managed to infiltrate Stalag 13 near Nurnberg, where German POWs were held, and smeared arsenic over 3.000 loaves of bread. 9.000 SS men got sick, but unfortunately, only 200 of them died. After that I immigrated to Israel and started working in this factory. I knew about the allegations against Bruno. I feared to speak up for him. I had started a new life. I wanted to forget the past and erase it. I didn't want to have to explain how I survived. Didn't want any rumors about how I took my revenge. The suitcase tore because you're over-stuffing it. Why two jackets? I don't need a jacket. Fine. Why don't you take a pill? Okay, I'll get you another suitcase. Hello, sir. I'm sorry, Mr. Zimmerman, you have to hurry up. -Yes, I know. You've got three more sacs. The postmen are coming in to work tomorrow morning, and... Yes. -What will they give out? -I know, I know. I'll stay here all night. Don't forget to lock up. -I won't. I was hospitalized in Netanya for a few weeks. By the time I returned to Jerusalem it was obvious to me that neither the Jewish Agency nor the Union would do anything. He was already one of them. After all, he'd fought in the Warsaw ghetto along with Mordechai Anielewicz. So I turned to the Nationalist Underground. I was friendly with some of them back in Poland, and they agreed to settle the score with him. I felt that death by gunshot was too easy. I wanted him to be beaten to death. Beaten to death. So I went with them, waited for him outside his clinic, and... When he came out, we closed in on him with toques over our faces and clubs under our clothes. It was dark, but one street light was lit, and I could see his face while we were beating him up. He showed no fear. He showed no fear. He was... Suddenly I heard an inner voice that wasn't my own saying, "leave him alone. "Leave him alone, this is a mistake." They left him there and went away. He was left lying on the ground. He didn't see my face because it was covered, but... He heard my voice. That he heard. I never wrote anything else after that. Stand against the wall! Yuvel, run to the gate! Yes, I recognized Zimmerman's voice. I wasn't surprised. I knew him well, he was a famous poet in Warsaw. I had respect for him and his poetry, but he felt it earned him some special status. He wanted easy jobs, new shoes, extra soup. His wife was pregnant. She was gassed the night they arrived with the two little children. His odds were against him too. He wasn't used to working. He didn't know how to use a shovel, a hammer, or how to steal. But he could speak pretentiously about the spirit of man, faith, compassion and hope. He ended up as a rat for the SS. For a few slices of bread he ratted out those who were sick, slacking off or stealing. Even me. He knew that I knew about it. Every day there I told him: "Have mercy. "Have mercy, Bruno Kaminski." Those damned Nazis haven't got a shred of mercy in them. Had he shown a bit more mercy, we'd have had the strength to bear it. That night, Bruno returned beaten up. He had to stitch up his own cheek. I told him that maybe we should go somewhere far away. Maybe a kibbutz, where we wouldn't run into people who knew us back then. But Bruno refused. He was sure of his innocence and claimed that running away would be an admission of guilt. I didn't want to run away because there was nowhere to go. There were thousands of survivors in Israel and I had to clear my name. I turned to the Communist Party in Jerusalem, and asked them to put me on trial. But they were busy fighting off the British and getting ready for war with the Arabs. They had no time to meddle in the past. Oven, this is 4, we're going in. I'm not asking for confirmation, I'm informing you. So come back at night with ammo, or we won't last out there. I'll explain it to you after the war! Listen up, everyone. In ten minutes we pull out, we're done waiting for them. Get your gear, come on. Gear up, everyone. Every morning Sarah would escort me to the clinic and back home every evening, and lock me at home. She'd play for me, tried to teach me to play the piano. I liked being her prisoner. I couldn't bear the thought that he's alive, and just two streets away from me. I went to Rabbi Landau and... He told me: "Forget it, Weismann. "Fix shoes, pray, give charity, "and God will give you the strength to go on." I fixed shoes, prayed and gave charity, but every day I'd walk to the Western Wall through Musrara and pass by his clinic. As fate would have it, I passed there one evening and saw him slicing a loaf of bread and eating it on his way out. At night I returned there with a canister of petrol, poured on the door and lit it up. I wanted to burn down his apartment too, but his wife was from a family of rabbis who'd perished in Treblinka. I didn't want to harm her. We had an idea who set the clinic on fire. But Bruno insisted not to go to the police. He didn't want to settle the score or to punish. He started seeing patients at home. I told him I'm scared someone might burn down the apartment. But he said it's close to other apartments, and that the bastards wouldn't dare to harm the neighbors. Then I found out I'm pregnant. I've never seen Bruno so happy. We went to a restaurant and after that to a bar on Ben Yehuda street. Luckily, no one knew him there. We danced till dawn. Bruno... He was a dancer. The band played the foxtrot. But when we returned home, I felt I couldn't raise a child in a home someone might set fire to. Go hang yourself, Buchman! I'm not scared of the police, and if you don't stop knocking on the door, I'll poison your cats who meow all night long! Tomorrow morning that witch will come and smell the stain. She'll think the child threw up, that I don't look after him properly, that I neglect him, that I'm irresponsible or crazy. Take me in your arms, Bruno, lay me in your bed, remove my nightgown and whisper something magical that would lift my spirits. At least he's running to Jerusalem. When we found out Sarah was pregnant, we went to the American consulate to get a visa. I also didn't want my child to have to bear my cross when he grows up. We thought people would understand after a few years time, and we could return. They interrogated us for almost two hours at the consulate. Doctors are a wanted profession. The interrogator was also impressed by Sarah being a pianist. He just wanted to make sure we're not communists and most of all, he wanted to know how we survived the camps. He was Jewish, his family must've perished there. It was obvious we had no chance at getting a visa. One of the consulate visitors must've heard the clerk call out Bruno's name, and so he followed us when we left. When we crossed the Muslim cemetery in Mammilla, he popped up behind one of the graves with a drawn gun. His name was Mishka Weiss. Bruno was in shock. He was sure this Mishka had died there, but... he was very much alive. He claimed that Bruno sent him to the gas chambers and that the Nazis, who were more decent than him, recruited him to the Sonderkommando at the crematorium. Bruno feared that this Mishka was going to shoot us, so he drew his gun and fired a shot. Mishka collapsed. Bruno ran to him, but Mishka must've still been alive, so Bruno shot him again. He took his papers and his gun. On the way home, Bruno told me that Mishka had killed four prisoners in his block for shoes, for a coat, for a slice of bread. Bruno always evaded my question about the scar on his forehead. When we got home he told me that this Mishka broke into his room one night with a pack of criminals and that they tried to kill him with wood they broke off the bunks. Mishka himself cut him with a sharp piece of tin. Had the prisoners not heard Bruno scream and saved him, this Mishka would've slaughtered him. I listened to his explanations and I understood, but... suddenly I also started fearing him. Sarah didn't sleep a wink all night. Whenever I looked at her, she'd look down. Like the time she was hospitalized at the Displaced Persons camp. She was silent. Her expression said it all: 'You were too quick to shoot him. This isn't Auschwitz. 'People's lives aren't cheap like they were back there.' Put it on quickly. Go on. Drop it down. I told Mishka that Bruno is a doctor in Jerusalem. I knew he had a big score to settle with him. I never saw him since. After the war I tried to buy eggs without stubs. I was caught. Yes, I offered Mishka money to kill him, but I was glad it didn't work out in the end. I'm the victim. I'm the witness. But I'm neither the judge nor his executer. We tried to get a visa to Sweden, France, Belgium. Sarah could've gotten a visa without me. I begged her to think about herself and the child. She refused. Meanwhile the war broke out. Our troops had been fighting heavy battles, so I decided to enlist. I understood why he wanted to enlist. He didn't even have to say it, the scars on his face said it all. But he had fought enough. He was wounded in the ghetto, survived Auschwitz and he was 40 years old. He owed nothing to anyone. Mommy's coming, Booboo. She became terrified. She had outburst of crying and rage, her hair started falling out. She stopped eating. Anything she ate came right up. One day she threatened me with an abortion if I enlist, and so I never left her alone. I hid my medicine bag from her, and my gun. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Lazer! "Softly singing measures wing "Sweetly, through my mind "Ring out, little song of spring "Ring out unconfined!" On the 15th of May the war broke out and he decided to enlist. I begged and cried. I managed to hold him back for three days. On the 4th day he went down to the recruiting office at the Schneller camp. I walked after him. When I got there I started yelling, I told the officer that Bruno was a Kapo in Auschwitz, that he collaborated with the SS, that he's a murderer, and that he murdered a man in Jerusalem as well. Then I saw Bruno's gun tucked in his belt. I grabbed it and threatened to shoot myself. Bruno hugged me, held me, took away the gun and walked me back home. She apologized, cried. She swore... but I knew she meant every word. I'm a murderer. I'm a collaborator. I can understand why anyone who wasn't there and didn't know who I was, would doubt me. But Sarah was there and she did know me. She wanted to kill herself because she knew she would never see me as completely innocent. But she was there. She saw how they got off the trains all battered up, how they were defeated as they were stripped and dressed in prisoner uniforms, how the moment they were shaved and numbered they became a herd of cattle. Doesn't she get it? Doesn't she see they accuse me to cover their own cowardice? Their own helplessness and wretchedness? Their self-disgust and shame? I who tried to save them, am I to blame for their shame and misery? Am I to blame for their deaths? From the moment I was imprisoned till the moment I was liberated, I forced myself to believe that people can stay humane even in the face of inhumane evil. I forced myself to hope that even when fearing death, one can fight for life with reason, sanity and solidarity. Doctor. Doctor, we're going, are you coming? What was left for me in that war? Mercy? Was I to give up on the sanctity of life in the name of mercy? Is Sarah right? Is there no sense in logic? No value in thought? No point in having a will? Doctor... -If every choice we make is worthy of contempt if there's no point in sanity and solidarity... -Let's go, Doc. If every choice we make just brings us closer to a senseless death, then I should've run to the electric fence the day I got there. Doctor, come on, we're going. What is it? Come, Doc. Two days later, late at night, there was a knock on the door. Some officer or a doctor, came to inform me. They were on the way to Ramat Rachel. The Arabs ambushed them with gunfire and mortar shells. Bruno got up to help a casualty. He ran to him without ducking despite the fire and the shells. He knew why he didn't duck. So do I. After all that's happened, she tried killing herself several times. I sat by her side day and night, trying to save her from herself, and the baby in her womb. We had a daughter her age, our only daughter. Dina. In the summer of 1939 she went to visit her grandparents in Warsaw. In September the war broke out and she never returned. After the child was born, it was very hard for me to care for him. Sometimes I'd cry so loud, that I couldn't hear him crying. The welfare officer came to take him to a kibbutz. I didn't let them... but they took him by force. So I went there and kidnapped him. I hardly cry ever since. Subtitles: Trans Titles Ltd.
