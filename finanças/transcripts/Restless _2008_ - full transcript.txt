This is for your jewelry empire. We regret to inform you that Fania Nitzke died today, after a long illness. The funeral will take place in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, at 16:00. Please be on time. The mourning family: Sara, her sister and Tzach, her son. Why didn't I get the merchandise? I had customers and I couldn't deliver. It happens. Sometimes things don't happen on time. You know how it goes. Yes, but the merchandise is here, huh? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you call me? Your cell phone was on voice mail all morning. I found somebody who pays cash instead of credit. That's breakable. It's fragile I'm telling you. It's fragile? And a deal isn't a deal? One never knows with you when we'll see payment. A bird in the hand... Moshe. What have you done to me? What have you done? You piece of shit! You know they almost killed me! I have a family, you whore on the Temple Mount!! Who do you think you're talking to? Moshe, are you crazy? Shimon, when did you find that sourpuss behind the bar? Today. She looks like something out of the old Stalag books. Where did you find her? Gestapo reserve camp? I need someone strong to run this place. She fought in the U.S. Army, the war in Iraq, I think. She came highly recommended. Fine, that's your problem. Women are trouble anyway. I was busy. I just got a new shipment of watches. I'll bring them tomorrow. Really! Walla! Walla! Moshe? Moshe Amar? Hello? Who's there? Moshe, wait! Come on, I'm sorry, give me a break. What do you mean, give me a break? You owe me 3 months' rent. Are you trying to make a fool out of me? Moshe, this is New York, not Be'er Sheva. It's Tiberias, okay? I'll get it to you in 2 days, okay? Son of a fuck with a brain of a duck! But don't forget, you're an illegal, Moshe. All I have to do is pick up the phone and you're out of here. They'll never let you back into America. Do you hear? Never. Are you happy now? I'm in mourning, you shithead, mourning. My son has been orphaned! So talk politely to me. I'm putting out a contract on you. Do whatever you want. - You don't get it. You're a dead man. Dead! - What do you know about death? "May His great Name be sanctified "in the world He created as He willed. "May He give reign to His kingship in your lifetimes "and in the lifetimes of the entire Family of Israel "May His great Name be blessed forever and ever "Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted, "Mighty and lauded be the Name of the Holy One "Blessed is He. Beyond all blessing and song, "all praise and consolation uttered in the world. Amen" Amen And watch over my son, Tzach. What are you doing here? Aren't you on compassionate leave? I can't take another day at home. One more day in my mother's place will drive me crazy. The official mourning period isn't even over yet. Who do I have in Tel Aviv? Some old nagging aunts? I have to be here. How's everything here? Fine. - Code yellow. We got a green light. We're moving out? Code Yellow? I'll be there in just a minute. - No, no, no, no way. What do you mean, "No way"? We've been hunting down that terrorist for two years now. I said "No", didn't I? - Tell me, why am I in the army? Don't worry. There will be other missions. You know I'm your best sniper. This is Tzach, I made him. I'm taking my shot. How'd it go? - Without a hitch. Are you okay? - He keeled over, he's dead. There was a little girl there but it's okay, she didn't see anything. Why are you looking at me like that? - You need some time off. Bro, come over here. - What? - Come with me. I want to talk to you. - I want you to recommend me for permanent service. Respect your mother's wishes, she wanted you to be discharged. I respected her wishes when she was alive. Now it's different. Wake up! Wake up! I'll be out in another 2 months. We'll go to India, South America. We'll get a perspective on life and as many Brazilian girls as you want. There are girls in Israel, too. I don't think you're suited for this whole army thing. There are so many other things to do without pulling a trigger. You know I was trained to be a sniper. I feel I am saving a lot of lives. - But you're ruining your own. This is what I know how to do. As a good friend, I expect you not to screw me over, all right? Come here, stand here. This is a good spot. Yes? What? But... which unit? Go on, sway your hips. This isn't Um el Fachem. Which unit? Where did you say he was serving? What? Commando? Which Commando unit? No, no I'm not worried. You know I hate the whole occupation thing. Sway your hips, Fatima, sway them. Listen, Pini, bro. - I'm not your brother. Let me see. Okay, you know what? Kill me. I attacked you like an animal, for no reason. I want you to kill me now. My life is screwed, go on, kill me. Don't worry. - Come on. You know we're all struggling to survive here. You think it's easy in New York? Suddenly you hear your wife is dead, your son is mad at you, you're broke, you lose it. You know what? Come here. Take this. Come one, take a bottle. Come on. Really. Hit me. From now on I pay you on time! Come on, hit me. Here, give me something, give me something heavy to carry. Which floor? The second one? The fifth floor and I'm not done with you yet. Don't think you're done. - You have a heart of gold. Moshe, you have to help me. The blacks stood me up. They're not answering their mobile. People are going nuts. The American Israelis are the most difficult types, spoiled, and with demands. Come on, get up on stage. Leave me alone. I'm not in the mood. Come on, read something, jokes, riddles, poems, whatever you want. Come on, get up there. Drinks are on me. I'm giving you a stage. - No, it's out of the question. I can't just pull stuff out of my sleeve. I left that business when I left the land of violence and stupidity. I'm a businessman now. - Moshe, what am I asking? It's not a big deal. - No, no, it's the principle of the matter. I tried to be an artist in Israel, no one gave a damn. It's in the past. Now I deal in watches, jewelry, screwdrivers, condoms, whatever. I just have to find my niche. I won't sell my soul anymore. - No one mentioned "soul", shithead. Who needs it? Don't do me any favors. Don't you understand that I'm ruining people's evening? This is dedicated with love, to my ex-wife, who has returned to the bosom of her loving family... in the sky. "When she was young, about 20 years old, "She searched for love on every road and path. "Bohemian, perhaps... but really just full of despair "She searched all over for someone who'd care "She wandered the streets but couldn't find love, "Until finally, God from above blessed her with gonorrhea... "Picked it up from me. "Then we had a son. I called him "Tzach". "There's nothing wrong with that, right? "I ignored him from the day he was born. "Actually, I regret not using a condom. "I forgot my 'Iove glove' and so our disaster was born. "Now he's a soldier in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. "And I'm screwing up and down the Hudson." There are a lot of Americans here who don't know any Hebrew. But they're laughing. Fine, in any case I prefer English. Hebrew, please. Hebrew, Hebrew, Hebrew. Why did you leave the Land of Idiots? To hear Hebrew here, too? "Isn't it enough that you're all married to your Israeli girlfriend "from Be'er Sheva to Afula, from Eilat to Metulla, "Rina and Geula and the shellshocked Shula, "the riveting Riva, the beguiling Gila, "the romantic Rama, the numbing Naomi, "Hadas who smokes grass, Lemore who needs more, "all came here to escape the next war, "Just bring them over and I'll give them what they're looking for. What are you? - An asshole. Thanks. I love you too. - Me too, mad about you. What did I tell you? It worked. I'm going to take a piss. - Go. Put this in your pocket. I piss on all of you. I don't like bleached blonde Israeli women. My wife had blonde hair, but she was Polish. Do you want me to vomit here? - Go ahead, vomit. Trying to scare me off with your Polish wife? I'd eat her for breakfast. Shut up! She's dead. Show some respect for the dead and their beds. Tell me, what do you have against Israeli girls? I'll make you come, you asshole. Slime. Money and a green card. That's all you can think about. You don't have the elegance of American girls, or the charm of the French hookers. Are you calling me a hooker? I'm an artist, like you. An artist? You're all hookers. I'm a singer. "Restless, he wanders the streets, "No one loves him, no one knows him, "Only at night he listens to the train whistle blowing. "He's leaving today, he'll be gone tomorrow." Wow, cool. I like that. Tell me, when you take aim at a wanted person... - Go on. Isn't it difficult? Maybe he has a wife, children. I look through the telescopic sight, I think about my father and it makes it easier. - No kidding? - Really. Take a picture. - Of what? Don't aim at me. - Take a picture. Great. - You took it? Thanks. - You're welcome. Shimon, get that anti-Semite off the stage. Anti-Semite? - Yes. Your wife came for the first time when I fucked her, you piece of shit. When you have a son, call him Moshe. And ask your wife how she got her hemorrhoids. You'll die, you sicko! You're lucky, she's ovulating now, you got lucky you impotent fuck! If it's a boy, remember what I said. And of course, light a candle at the Western Wall. Okay, Moshe, that's enough. You're not continuing. Because of assholes like you, our country is going down the drain. Because of me? - Yes, you. You piece of shit. All you think about is sex and being provocative. Who is that? I recognize that voice. He ran away. I'm the one who fought. I'm the one who continues to fight. Musayef, Major Yossi Musayef. Do you remember me? It's coming back to me. Musayef the butcher. You kill Palestinian women and children as a service to the nation. No, no. I'm in hi-tech. Sophisticated arms systems. Air-to-air missiles. We sell to the Pentagon. Two weeks here, two weeks in Israel. Here's my business card. You dropped something. - No, no, that's for you. Get something to eat, you parasite. You look too thin. "Just to let you know, my mother's funeral went fine without you. "Nobody missed you. So thank you for not coming." Guys, come over here. Don't hold them up too long. They're hot too. Okay? See what a good marksman I am? - 77 virgins await him in heaven. 72, idiot. - Yeah, for a suicide bomber. But for a suicide cockroach, it's something else. What a shitty place to be stuck in. For a suicide cockroach, it's 77. Maradona! Damn it. - Damn. Who's there? This number showed up on my phone. I can't talk now, I'm on duty. - No problem, you called me. I don't even know where you got my number. It was in her address book, I found it when she died, along with your pictures and the letters that you never answered. Where are you? - In the Jordan valley. I got stuck with menial jobs because I'm an orphan. They turned me into a policeman. I just... I... couldn't manage... I wasn't able to make it. I have to go. - I had a ton of work. It's very difficult. Five more minutes and the game is over. Anyway, they're beating you. We got cut off. - I waited for you to come. I told you, I... I couldn't make it, I had too much work. Get out of here. Go away. Go. Go. What? What... what's going on? Enough with this game. We're on duty! Get lost! What's happening there? You asshole, I told you to come to the funeral, didn't I? What... what's going on there? Were those gunshots? What happened? Get up, get up! Get my bag. - Water, water, water. Bring it over here. Tell them to send a helicopter. Quick! Quick! Get some more water. Soon, soon. Hang in there. Your father will come and take you away and everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. You'll see. It's nothing. A little bit longer, just a little bit longer. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Don't stop, don't stop. Don't stop breathing. I want to hear you breathing. Just a little bit longer. Since when do you have belly dancers? - It was his idea. He says he can't recite poetry for more than an hour at a time. All of a sudden that asshole is full of confidence. The village sewer poet. My profits have increased by $10,000 ever since he started. I pay her peanuts. Look... look at her dancing. I left the army about 10 years ago. Who replaced me? Zvika Shlush. Not long ago he called and said, "Yossi, guess who's in my unit. "Go on". I said, "Who?" He said "Moshe Amar's son." No kidding? - Yes, and he's a good guy, one of the best killers we have in the territories. No shit. I didn't even know he had a son... - He does, he does. What do you mean my request is denied? I've been a squad leader for 10 months now. I have a perfect record. The boy is still in hospital. The world media is involved, his parents are giving interviews. All he wanted to do was play soccer. It wasn't intentional. The gun accidentally went off. It's in everyone's best interest that you change jobs... especially yours. Do you really want to deal with inquiries and psychologists? It was an accident. My soldiers will testify, my superior officer, Arik. Arik didn't sign the recommendation. Look, Tzach, you are an excellent soldier and soon you will be an excellent civilian. Your compulsory service ends soon. Your whole life is ahead of you. That's all. - That's not all. I gave the army my life. All my plans were this army. I'm sorry, Tzach. I wish I had a choice in the matter. Where are you going? - Jerusalem. - Get in. (in Arabic) So? - Can I have a cigarette? - Sure. It's "Imperial". Thank you. "Danke shoen". - Oh, are you German? No, I'm an Israeli. Then what are you doing here, you blond Brad Pitt? I bet myself that I would get out of here alive, unarmed, without any money, without a mobile, nothing, even though I was a sergeant here for 10 months. What did you bet on? - A beer. A beer! No shit! - Aren't you afraid? Afraid of what? We're neighbors, we want peace. We want to develop the Middle East, we just want to live our lives. To live and develop the Middle East. - The new Middle East. How's everything, Roy? - Tzach, what's going on? I was discharged. - No way! When? Okay, you can go, go ahead. Cheers! - Cheers. There are girls from all over the world here. They're all looking for the meaning of life in Al-Quds Al Quds. Excuse me, can you bring us another round in bigger glasses? Anything else? Thank you. The center of the world. This is the center of the world. That's why everyone is so despondent, so tense, so restless. I don't understand. - Everything is insane here. No one knows what tomorrow will bring. There is only the night. It's the same for you and for us, exactly the same. Because this is the land of the Bible, God's city. What's doing, Yevgenya? - My name is Svetlana. - Oh, Svetlana. Yes. - Svetlana, Svetlana. Join us. Waitress, four more beers. - Why not? Where's Ibrahim? Ibrahim? He left. Where'd he go? - To set off a bomb. Good morning, did you sleep well, Tzach Amar? Wow. It's late! Come on, let's go. Get up, quickly, quickly. What bomb? Where will he set it off? Calm down, we're just joking, calm down. Calm down, we're just fooling around. Here's Ibrahim. Excuse me, are there poetry readings here? - Not here. This is a jazz bar. So there aren't any poetry nights? The ads say Moshe Amar performs here. Hey, Yossi, we have ourselves a Moshe Amar fan. You're new here in New York? - Yes, I just arrived. Nice to meet you, I'm Yossi Musayef. I'm Tzach. - Tzach, a student? No, I just got out of the army and I've come to see America. Tzach, I deal in arms and technology. Take this. Do you know anything about arms? I was a sniper in the army, but that's behind me now. You can never know what's ahead, what's behind... Are you looking for work or do you just like poets? I hate poets. I need someone to watch my back, if you get my drift. We'll see. - Think about it. - Thank you. I told Shimon, if he doesn't get rid of him, I'll take all my money out of this bar. And then the air will go out of here just like a balloon. At first, he thought I was kidding. But not anymore. And don't forget to buy it. I want to say one more thing to my brothers in Israel, "My glorious brothers, heroes of battles, schooled in suffering, "This may disappoint you, it doesn't rhyme, it isn't funny, "and it isn't a critique, "but where else could I have found such beautiful people as you, "who else could I talk to about myself, ourselves, "about our country, no one else's, "about our girls, "about our army, and no one else's, "that defeated seven Arab armies in six days. "Perhaps we have become spoiled, corrupt, since then, "we have become confused, we have lost our way. "But where else in the world can we feel at home "as we do in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, "with or without the Temple Mount. "And that's all, from the Israeli fort in New York..." Hey, you there. - Are you talking to me? - Yes. My name is Tzach. Tzach Amar. I'm done. Thank you. Thank you. So it's you, Tzach. - It's me. 21 years old. - Next month. So how... - How what? How am I? I'm fine. How are you? I'm so happy you're here. Let me hug you. You don't look anything like me. Let's get a drink. We'll find a quiet corner, it's noisy here. When did you arrive? - Yesterday. We have a lot to talk about. Let me take a good look at you. You're really handsome. But I knew that from the photos. Another beer? - Why not? I'm sorry I didn't make it to the funeral. I was... in a mess here. But it doesn't matter, I should have been there. But I hadn't seen her in 20 years and suddenly to stand by her grave... I've stood by a lot of graves. - Oh, Tzach, Tzach. You don't know how I feel seeing you, Tzach. Tzach. Some name. - It means a secular Zionist. I chose it. Cheers. Secular Zionist. - Sicko Sniper. My mother was Polish, that's why my father named me Tzach. He couldn't stand her. Tzach is like Chach. No, you're wrong. - She OD'd on sleeping pills and alcohol. I thought it was cardiac arrest. - No. You thought her heart stopped beating when she was alive. Any way you look at it, her heart isn't beating anymore. You can feel safe. Your mother was a beautiful woman. You inherited her good looks. Think about it, you could have looked like me. You're good with words, no two ways about it. But your charm doesn't work on me the way it did on her. Let's go outside where we can breathe and talk at the same time. Come on. Whatever you say, you're not going to get out of this. I took into account that you'd have a way with words. I'm out of it, my sweet boy, I got out 21 years ago. The question is whether I want back in or to keep on running. Words, rhymes, Dylan Thomas, Eliot, Bialik, words and more words. What do you want? Do you want me to crawl on the sidewalk and beg for your forgiveness? I'm not asking for forgiveness. I left because I couldn't stay. "An orphan impure whose father made sure, "To condemn his soul to life without parole, "In the frozen tomb "Of his mother's womb "And on the radio Oom Kultoom." You write well. I didn't know you got them. You never answered. I didn't have your address. - You didn't ask for it. No matter, you write nicely. Maybe it's in the genes. Come on, spit it out, get it out of your system. I'm here to listen. You pull the trigger, slowly, gently, through the telescopic sight 500, 700 meters away, and then the guy just keels over and dies. He'll never see his family again. "But you served your country." - No, I don't accept that. Okay, so go. Get out of here, you poet in exile. Go. I'm trying to understand what... what you want from me. What could I possibly want? From you, who taught me everything, who took me to the park, bought me pacifiers and toothbrushes, who recited poems by Alterman and Kipling to me every night. What could I possibly want from you? - I didn't want a kid. I didn't want a crying woman hanging around me. I didn't want to stay in a country that had only wars in its future, Nothing suited me, from start to finish. What can I say? I made mistakes, I can't change them. I can't take them back. Your mother was a sexy woman, a free-spirited Bohemian soul who didn't take the pill and followed her emotions. Does that mean I owe you my life?! Go! Do you see a stop sign? - But the fact is you're here. So maybe it's not because of me. But maybe we still have a chance to move a few molecules in our souls. I'll think about it. What do you want? - I want to work. You said you needed someone to watch your back, a bodyguard. Does that suit you? - All I need is a gun. Moshe, I have to talk to you. You're going to get married. You'll probably have another kid and you'll be a great dad, right? Yes, I'm ready for it now. For years I felt I was losing my sanity. I felt I was all alone in the world. Nobody gave a damn. I didn't even know you. You never visited, not even once. I have no memory of you. You had a ready made son, who grew up like an abandoned flower in Tel Aviv, but it meant nothing to you. Because I felt I had already lost you, from the first moment. I gave you up. I wasn't there. You abandoned me, left me with a depressed woman, who had nothing to give me but her anger. She would draw herself, a heart, blood spurting on her shirt and a face with no eyes. I couldn't even have given you that. My only thought was to save Moshe. Tell me something about yourself. I still don't know anything. What do you like? What's important to you? What can I tell you? I'm not interested in politics. I don't know a lot about literature though I do read whatever I can get my hands on. I just try to make it from one day to the next. Me too. A long journey, huh? Do you have a girlfriend? - No. Only casual encounters. All the girls I've been with said I was the best lover they ever had and then they ran away from me like the plague. Why? - I don't know. They said I hold myself back, I don't show any feelings. Maybe it's true. Maybe I don't have your passion for sex and career and the country that has lost its way and disappointed the whole world. No, not the whole world, just me. Or maybe it's I who disappointed myself. I'm not sure anymore. But can we still try to get to know each other a little bit? I would have liked to. I really would. Me too, it could have been nice. But you'll never be able to forgive me, will you? I can forgive you for leaving me, but not for killing her. You never answered a single one of her letters. It doesn't matter. She should have learned to forget, and go on with her life, that's what people do. It could have been nice. We could have been good friends, I dreamed of that my whole life. But I'm in a different place now. I've burned my bridges. I've run out of time. What do you mean? - I screwed up. I have nowhere to go. The only thing I knew how to do was to fight and defend my country. Who'll defend me now? I'm not a commando soldier anymore. Don't do it. Don't mess up your life. You're so young. Don't get into trouble. But I'm already in trouble. I have nowhere to go. I have no home, no mother. I have no country and I don't know anyone in this city. You know me. - No I don't, you're a stranger. Then get to know me. I feel lost, too. I also burned all my bridges. But I'm your father, Moshe, the one who didn't buy pacifiers, the one who never read Alterman's poems to you, I'm still your father. I'll look after you. Stop! Stop, Moshe. Stop. Where do you think you're going? What do you think you're doing? - I'm walking to you. I'm walking with you, I'm walking with you. This is America, the land of unlimited opportunity. We have so many options. How's the soup? - Tastes like shit.
