VOICES SON MOTHER FATHER GIRL BEACIE AND IRKOWI SPRING Oh table levitate... above the town Oh table levitate... above the town When each bite of bread Perforates my palate And starry dust spirals above my head Oh levitate And don't let me forget That bits of bread can cure Numbness in our tongues Today we sit at the table As we do each night At dinner time When mother serves A steaming TV set And father carves it With fork and knife Today As usual They gave me the best cut Ajuicy throat Of a reporter And a sugar coated head Of a weatherwoman Today as well For the first time During dinner, l noticed nobody looked at me Her light awakens fear But it's easy to approach her When she spurts from the table From the chairs the wall The fountain is our mother. Father's face shadows Only his eyes glow in the silence The fountain bore us Mother renders Cauldrons and bottles Sticky and without milk The fountain is our mother Trying to preserve her fertility She washes her breasts and hands The fountain bore us ln our apartment And we never know From where she'll spurt anew The fountain is our mother Her milk soothes pain The fountain is our mother And puts our fear to rest So we stand vigil in the darkness staring At furniture Unguarded moment ls too costly l cannot hammer nails anymore When l'm doing this Her body escapes From under my fingers l cannot hammer nails anymore Nor forgive myself My losses Every so often The wall overwhelms me l cannot anymore l don't know who she is Mother or lover Though at dawn l kiss her cold bare feet And undress her fragile plaster SUMMER SUMMER When there is a full moon l can never enter My father's room As soon as it arrives Father closes the door And doesn't speak to me Only at dawn l feel through my skin The presence of the moon l don't wake up though it's better that way To leave them alone At night ln the midst of our apartment Grows the tree whose roots Reach the neighbor below Whereas its crown Penetrates the ceiling of the bright room Of the one who lives above us We nurture our tree With stern care Water it each day And clean the bark Killing worms Grows the tree At night we believe ln our tree's omnipotence We feel needed Therefore we stand by Watching the filth Of the neighbor below We know about his thievery And drunkenness His blasphemies Reach us often Lying down on the floor We witness as every night ln his damp and murky apartment He has a different woman Who always cries with ecstasy And hungrily nestles to her breast His hairy chest We are disturbed by not knowing What our neighbor above makes of it The peaceful and silent tenant As silent, as nonexistent Who every day ls lost in prayer But we believe that flowers Blooming from the branches ln his living room Draw juices from the dark soul Of the tenant below This image Always returns lnto my father's dream Naked l walk thoughtfully Through the dense garden of his library Touching the books He allowed me to touch And l am full of bitterness Father sees it and waits Until you fall asleep Then he kneels and touches your ribs So when awakened ln the arms of a close and distant woman You would feel carnal pleasure But father Still dreaming Cannot see That the woman who is oblivious To the warning voice that snakes Will break into the drawer She will break in and read That we are naked And unprotected in a dream Which only is Father's library At dawn Father will wake Under the weight of perspiration Only after a while Will he decide to rise Shuffling his feet Among the dried leaves Until he will understand That no one believes in dreams Anymore AUTUMN AUTUMN ln our apartment The floors sprout grass So we can walk barefoot And enjoy it in silence The grass is good lt grows tall Entwining chair legs lt kills our fear Of loneliness lts wisdom ls also in its cycle lt dies in spring To be reborn in winter Grass knows how to give birth As far as l can remember Mother sits at the table And instead of TV She watches grass Father scythes the grass ln our apartment a festivity begins We put on clean shirts And l turn off the record player Nobody knows that at night Dew covers the cut grass l wake up then With the taste of blood ln my mouth ln the innermost room Of our apartment The roes graze Their moist eyes Touched by darkness shine And the furniture grows bark Each night Picked clean by roes' teeth We all sprout leaves Our roots crack the walls We all sprout leaves Our roots crack the walls Our faces bloom When nuzzled By velvet nostrils Father, mother and l We like to stare As the roes eat from our hands And walk safely Through our apartment Through our dream Though each evening The neighbors draw their radios And sharpen their TV sets WINTER WINTER ls it possible That one day we'll go away All of us The apartment will remain empty And the walls will dry up Without our breath ls it possible That flowers knobs and chairs Will not be ovegrown with moss Mother ever older And father in gloves So much pain in their bones We touch hidden corners Beat the carpets Not to think about it When dust presses itself too early Silently into our eyes and mouth We believe hidden tears will make dust fertile And someday we will overgrow with moss New mother and father, with their hands yet free From gloves will touch us in silence Enjoying the new moss in the old apartment Winter Already in my house Father has frozen upon the table Mother sways carrying the supper Against the wind that touches her eyes Chilled to the bone, my father's hand Attempts to transfer the reign lnside the bed shackled with ice Pulses the spring of old blood l can't peel my face Frozen to the window l hear fading steps Crunching snow lt's you Fading away from the sky lced in stillness Fluorescent frost Covers carnival trailers lron hearts ln shooting galleries My hand ls red like the dawn ln the chapped skin one can trace The contour of high mountains And forgotten touches Crystals on frosted windows Crumble in my hand And only silence and this waltz Will endure
