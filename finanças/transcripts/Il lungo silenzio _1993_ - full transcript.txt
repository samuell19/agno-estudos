THE LONG SILENCE Look Carla, have you seen that? Aren't you going on vacation, Luigi? I have already been when you were in America. So only one week. I'll get the rest at Christmas. I hope you and your wife will go abroad. Count on me, Duilio. I'll make him, like this time! - But it was hard ma'am! - Yes, but I won! Hello? Hi Francesco, how are you? Tell me. When, sorry? Tomorrow. Okay. Who should come tomorrow? I'm sorry... I have to go back. But we still have three days! I know, I'm sorry. But I can't help myself. I'm staying here. I'm very sorry. I just wanted to take a walk on the beach. It's not possible, we wouldn't have the situation under control. There is no one, we do the vacations out of season. Believe me, it's not possible at this hour. Alright, I'll go alone. It's nice to eat out here. We should have done this since the first night. If Duilio allowed us to do it it's because he had mercy on us. It's true that it's beautiful here. I confess that I don't feel like leaving. What a liar! But you can't wait to get back to your computers! Lie to me? Look me in the eye. But you're crazy! Excuse me. I have to ask you to come back, you can't stay here anymore. Do you think we'll make it someday, living a bit more peaceful? Of course. I'm sure of it, yes. Thank you. See you later. Hello, hi mom, yes we are back. - Francesco. - Yes. No, we didn't fight! Then I'll tell you. No, it was beautiful. Mom I'll call you back later. OK, bye. Yes I understand, of course. I'll catch up with you. All right. So, what do you think? Sounds like a great job to me. You've managed to get them to say a lot of things. But he only wants to keep talking to you. He doesn't trust anyone anymore. Of course now he's more terrified than before. He realizes that he is burned. And how did the boss react this time? In the usual way, he he pushes us forward. But he's also very concerned about the consequences. He will be afraid that they will take the case away from us. That too. But you know what Thomas is like, don't you? He will fight like a lion, not to let us take away the investigation. He says, however, that it is very risky. If the Minister intervenes, we are done. You didn't understand. - It's not only this that he fears. - Come on, Francesco! The worse would be to miss out on a promotion. Or having the inspectors from the Ministry block everything. Then goodbye inquiry! Look I'm not afraid. I'm just telling you that, according to Thomas, the matter is much more serious than that of bribes. These are manufacturers of death. Assuming we can prove it. Of course we can prove it, you stole my vacation for this! Tell me but... where did you hide Fantoni? Do you always play this game of yours? - Hi. - Hi. What is today's message? "I am not of those who feel offended by the violation of their intimacy, when burglars break into their house." I can't stand that someone going through my things. - How was your vacation? - Fine. - I'm really happy for you. - How about you? - I'm desperate. - Why? - I fell in love with a reader. - A reader? What is it, an animal endangered? What are you saying, it's someone who comes here to read. - Well, you have a bookstore! - He comes here to see me. He follows me everywhere. Listen, but besides reading... does he talk? Not yet. But I feel like it's going to happen today. You know, he's very young. But he's beautiful! What do you think about it? You know Rosa, sometimes I would like to live them myself these tragedies that are so natural. Sorry. You're right, I do look like a jerk. Sometimes I wonder: but would you fit in Carla's place? What do you say? No. Morning. - Good morning, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Judge Canova. I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances, But it was necessary. For your safety. I know he wanted to talk to me. You wish to sit down? Please. You may begin. Beautiful these books. How is your leg? Better, I walk already like a little girl. You have to hold it up! Your blood pressure? Do you want me to measure it for you? I'm doing great. I don't want to talk about my illnesses. And I don't want to talk about Marco and me. Shall we have a coffee? - What are we talking about then? - About your drawings. About the books you've read, what you've seen on TV. - I don't watch television anymore. - Not even the news? Especially the news. After everything I've seen lately... I am afraid to discover something terrible about Marco. Think of something cheerful, for once. Nice! When did you start this? You know what? I'm much quieter when I'm alone. I get terrified when you're walking around with your husband. Please mom, don't start again. If dad had done the same job as Marco, you would have supported him, as I do. You're right. But when you have a daughter, you think differently. If you had children you would understand me. But we don't. Why do you wait up for me until this hour? - Are you hungry? - No. I made you something. Thanks, but I ate a sandwich with Francesco. I'd take a whiskey instead. When you throw politicians in jail representing popular sovereignty, and entrepreneurs who represent the living and active part of our economy, it is difficult not to foresee uncontrollable psychological situations and more. Not even in the worst dictatorial regimes, judges behave like this. Can you turn that thing off for me? The statement comes while in the Court of Cassation the debate begins on the bribes trial that will decide the heavy sentences... Was it really that necessary to interrupt your vacation? Francesco convinced an important guy to talk. Finally someone speaks, even in this city. - Are you happy? - No, I'm disgusted. And what did you do? I saw my mother, then I went to the cinema. Why are you disgusted? What movie did you see? You wouldn't have liked it. - Why? Was it a sentimental movie? - Yes. Although right now I would gladly see it. I'll get you some tapes. If I had time, I would like a movie. Hey, can I have another one? Thank you. This guy who started talking, is he reliable? He brings up a lot of people. Important people. Do you think they will let you go all the way? Thank you. Stopping is not easy, and then the danger doesn't exist. At least until we have no arguments... valid on the criminal side. There is just Tommaso who.... seems a little worried. Why worried? I'm going to sleep. I feel really tired. - Aren't you coming? - Yes, right away. - Why don't you want to keep it? - I still feel too young. What does your boyfriend say about it? He doesn't understand anything, he would like you to keep it. You can be happy about it, usually the opposite happens. I already have a little brother to take care of. So are you going to help me? Think about this for a moment longer. There's no hurry. Please don't say anything to my father. Don't worry about it. - Hi, Carla. - Hi. How many appointments do we have this afternoon? Five, doctor. Good morning from the early morning radio news. In studio Sandro Favilla. Here are the headlines: the controversy between political forces over the issue of hidden funding to parties does not subside, and will probably mean early political elections. Heavy sentences for the defendants requested by the prosecutor in the maxi trial for the bribes scandal in Milan. Starting today, the defense pleas. It started yesterday in Cassation the judgment of third degree for the scandal of bribes in Rome, discovered at the time by the Public Prosecutor of the capital city. It's always a pleasure to start the day with lots of good news. - You should be used to it by now. - Yes, but every day is worse. I'm going. Maybe I have some good news for a change. Maria is pregnant. She came to me yesterday. - Francesco didn't tell me. - He doesn't need to know, yet! I certainly don't tell him, not right now at least. Bye. - Hello? - Your husband, has already made enough trouble, tell him to calm down. It will be better for him. Please Carla, don't fret. He will only be a mythomaniac. The people I deal with don't make threats over the phone. Stay calm. I will make sure they change the number right away. So don't think about it anymore. Try to have a good day. Please I am in a hurry, have patience. - Excuse me, - Nothing. The fact you got your hands on huge interests. Now they're going to try to stop us. They're going to try to scuttle everything, as they used to do before your arrival. They had already tried this when we dealt with the bribes. But none of us had ever received - phone threats. - By phone never. But you forgot those crazy intimidations from the benches of Parliament? This is no longer about thieves. But of a real criminal system that tries to involve entire pieces of the State. - The pieces of a broken state. - Yes. But which is capable of attacking and to defend itself and to cover up it's own crimes. I'm afraid you are at even greater risk than before. The people we deal with don't kill magistrates. At least, not here. I don't know. I'm afraid we are facing a quantum leap. It does not care about the ways nor the means, to achieve the goals these gentlemen have given themselves. If you can put the evidence together that certain politicians are involved in this business, as well as in the history of arms trafficking, may God protect us. God generally protects them. Maybe it's because they always light a lot of candles. Candlesticks, you mean. I believe a large destabilization operation is underway. A complex design, that aims to delegitimize the institutional organs of the state. All signs point in that direction. And it is also for this reason Marco, that I consider the phone call to your wife very significant. From this moment on we will revise - all security measures. - Even more armoured? No! Who represents the authority of the State in enemy territory, has a duty to be invulnerable. You know very well who supported this requirement. But it still blew up. The fact is that of the State there's very little left. Well... before they take away what's left, to work! Come on! Good work. These are the exact transcripts of our conversations. Are you sure? You look me in the eye. You look me in the eye, Mr. Judge. Hello? Now you're exaggerating. - A wrong number. - Our agreement, was that you would always tell me the truth. - Even if it's unbearable. - That's what I do. No, you don't! You're always trying to protect me. Even if I did, what's wrong with that? How is it possible that they already know the new number? Look... none of us is taking this seriously. I'm sure... that there is someone who enjoys to scare us. But I am afraid. You give it too much importance. What if they had threatened me, and not you? What are you saying? - Have you had any threats? - See how different you react, - when it comes to me? - Tell me the truth! No, nobody threatened me. I just want you to understand what's it like to be afraid for the other! Carla, don't make me feel guilty. You knew from the beginning the life that was waiting for us. I think... I've been always clear about that. Yes, but 10 years ago we were in the middle of people, we went to the movies, we took walks. We'll start again. Of course! With the whole army around us! You're overlooking the benefits. No parking problems, they don't remove our car anymore. That's it... that's how I like you. I... I'd like to ask you something. Couldn't you... just for some time... live with your mother? I would feel more comfortable. You see that you are not as calm as you want me to believe? With everything that's going on, I can't afford any weakness. There are moments when I can't concentrate. Because I get to thinking about you. So I would be your weakness? You are asking me to abandon you. No way, I'm staying with you. At what point are you with your investigation? Shall we have a nice coffee? I'll spare you the details. They can't interest you. Everything interests me. Do you know our investigation on bribes to parties and politicians? We have carried it out. We discovered, by checking some accounts in Switzerland, arms trafficking. Very sophisticated. They are high officials, industrialists, political and military leaders, who are involved in it. The mechanism is very simple. They use public bodies, that provide aid to Third World countries. Deviated services, to provoke wars. And provide weapons, of all kinds. Nuclear, bacteriological, pitting one government against another. Needless to say, the profits that come out of this are enormous. These people are responsible for thousands of deaths! It's unbelievable how many people are involved! Mafia, deviated services, secret lodges! Also government men. I'm afraid so. - Will there be any arrests? - Not right away. Do these people know they're being investigated? They're going to be shaking... I hope not. With what is happening in our country right now, with public opinion starting to play a role of a certain importance... they can't afford everything to stay as before. I don't think so. Good morning, madam. But if Marco is sure not to run from any danger... I know. It's stronger than me. I don't trust anybody anymore, I see a danger In everyone who is on the street, under the house. When he arrives or leaves, in all those who approach him. I react like a hysteric. Don't you think it would be better to warn Marco about that thing? To stress him out even more? He worries about me. Did something go wrong at the studio today? No, nothing. Is it your mother who still gives you thoughts? No, on the contrary these days she is particularly balanced. She's doing a series of drawings, with such a strange title... "The Horrors of Paradise". Well, it could be. What's wrong? I feel it. I see it. But, are you so persistent even in your interrogations? That doesn't fit. What's wrong with it? I'll tell you tomorrow. Don't you still have to work? Yes, unfortunately. Go on then. I'll bring your coffee in your study. All we needed was this candle. Thank you. No, tuna again! Tell me something: How do you keep your wife calm? I'm more worried about the kids. My wife doesn't speak anymore. Maria is in constant tension. The little one is now unbearable. If we had children, I think I would have moved out by now. You're just saying that because you don't have any. Wait. We should do something about Carla. I really want to see her. Well, how about a shot of life? - Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. It's been a long time since we saw each other. - Very. - I reserved a table for you upstairs. Thank you. - You're welcome. Good to see you. Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. Hi. Hi. Did you thank Francesco? It is thanks to him that we are here tonight. Thank you, Francesco. He's the one who had this brilliant idea, which he calls "a stroke of life!". At least for tonight no sandwiches in the office. And how come your wife didn't come too? She went to the country for a few weeks. And she let herself be sent away without protesting? Yeah you're right, let's go. Sorry Francesco, it's just that Marco can't wait to get rid of me. - Let's go. - Let's go away. Yes, it's better. But what happens? How come they're all leaving? I don't know, ma'am. Who are you looking at? Do you know him? Good evening, have you already chosen? Michele will accompany you home, I go to the office. - I have a lot of work. - That's why this shot of life! - Have patience, go ahead. - Patience is my only gift! - Bye. - Bye. Michele, what does your wife say about the life you lead? Madam, what does she say? She says she wants a divorce. - And what do you reply to her? - Me? I'll tell her to be patient. - Do you have children, doctor? - Thankfully, no. Do you have something against children? On the contrary. Doctor your husband called, he sends for you. Yes, thank you. Here. I sent Michele to pick you up to prepare my suitcase, - not for me to come here! - Michele has nothing to do with it. I wanted to see you before you left. - Where do you have to go? - To Zurich, for two days. Together with that guy sitting back there. It's Fantoni. I was going to call you as soon as I arrived. If you can never call me at home. I know, but maybe I have a way to get around the interceptions. Ah, I meant to ask you: can you avoid, these two days, to go to the studio? You can stay home. Or you could go to your mother. Why all these precautions? It's just precautions, nothing serious! Anyway, Michele remains at your disposal if you want to move. But I have never been escorted, not even with you. Do as I say! I have to go. Michele already knows everything, he will take you home, bye. See you soon. They sure do look good, huh? These will look nice in your home. The color recalls the color of your armchairs. Yes, I would love this for your house. Let's see again... I understand everything you tell me about Marco, How I understand that you see in him a kind of hero of our time. But you know my point of view. I don't care about heroes, even less the times that need heroes. I read it yesterday in one of the books you gave me. Maria? I would have come tomorrow to tell you. I decided to keep it. So from now on we will see each other much more often. You know, Massimo and I have decided to move in together. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. - Hi, Carla. - Hi. What did you decide to keep? Who is it? She is Maria, the daughter of Francesco Mancini, - Marco's colleague. - Ah, that one! Another hero, in spite of himself. Who is it? - Madam, it's Michele. Mr. Judge, for you. - Marco? - Hi. Good thing you called me. - I'm on my way to the airport now. Is everything OK? - Yes. - When are you arriving? - Don't wait for me. I'll wake you up when I get there. Bye. And sorry about the other day. I missed you. You too. Very. Bye. Come, I'll make you a coffee. Thank you ma'am, but I have to go to the airport to pick up your husband. - There's still time! - No, better go now. We need to check the situation. Are you convinced that they are not there? No! You don't get away with that! If I don't know here, you know where I am! Let me tell you, sheriff! How could she know? She and Kit used to spend days together! They didn't spend them all here! Kit is at the mine. And she knows how to go there. Now ask her! - Jenna. - I can't help you, Sheriff. You mean you don't want to! I said I can't. Either you are on our side or on theirs! I am not on anyone's side! By now you can't can't be neutral anymore. It's not just about them anymore! People are fed up. Show us the way to the mine and save us the trouble. I have already answered you. Extraordinary edition of the news. Good evening. We interrupt the programs to bring you a dramatic news which has just arrived in the newsroom. An aircraft, a Falcon 10 took off from Zürich to Rome, a few minutes ago exploded in flight. The causes of the disaster are not yet known. No other details are known. We can however tell you who was on board of that plane. On board, besides the two crewmen, was the judge Marco Canova and the two men of the escort. And another passenger, whose identity has not been made known. It is unknown, at the moment, if there were any survivors. Deputy Prosecutor Marco Canova, had become very well-known even abroad, for his investigations into slush funds and bribes. "I establish as my universal heir my wife Carla Aldrovandi. I intend, with this decision to show you once again the deep affection and esteem I have always had for you. The gratitude for all the things beautiful and good things she has given me. Gratitude for being close to me in all the important moments, and painful moments of our life, regretting only that I wasn't always able to give her what I wanted and to understand her as she wished and as she deserved. The memory of the happy years is indelible in me spent together in harmony and in full communion of spirit. Rich in affection and mutual understanding, Even in mistakes and disagreements. Never stronger than the sincere and deep that has united us. I do not own any real estate. As for my movable property, I wish them to remain the property of Carla, to whom I beg to provide for the preservation or destruction of my documents, stored in the base of the bronze, related to my recent judicial activity. In honor of my parents, I want to remember that the principles that have guided me throughout my life are the result of the education they received. And that, if to some extent, I have been able to operate well as a man and as a citizen, I owe this above all to to the teachings and constant examples of my father and mother, to whom my infinite gratitude goes." - Good morning. - Morning. - Judge's personal effects. - Put them on the chest. Isn't it better to let some some time pass before looking at Marco's charts? Good morning, madam. Come in, Dr. Mancini is waiting for you. Carla. Is there any news? Very little and nothing. You know very well who has been entrusted the investigation, don't you? And then? The most absolute immobility. The most incredible caution, and one that goes with leaden feet. - What can you do? - Officially nothing, you know. Although I might have an idea. But now the most important thing is to continue Marco's work. That's what he would have done in my place. Marco always said that you are the only one of the same race as him. Well, the school is the same. The one of Tommaso. By the way... the old man is worried about you. Did Marco tell you who he was investigating? We saw what hands you didn't shake at the funeral. Carla... like a good girl... Try to forget what you know. I am not afraid. Not anymore. I know you're working hard to make me a grandfather. - Maria told you, then! - Only after she told you. - Are you happy? - No! It makes me feel old. It's nice here with you. How is it going with your father? Always complaining about becoming a grandfather? I'm really scared for him. And so is my mother. But he never talks about it with me, with my father even less. And I can't stand this tension. - Is this why you wanted to see me? - This way of his living... is very selfish of you! He thinks only of himself, of his duty. If only there were more rigorous men like Marco and Francesco. I don't want my father to risk his life for anyone! Not even for me! It's cruelty! To my mother who can't even feed herself anymore. And who seems to be totally absent. But especially towards my brother, who is small and doesn't understand anything. Have you tried talking to your dad about it? I've tried many times. But he pretends not to understand. Do you want me to talk to him about it? Yes, please. But not even literary awards don't sell more novels! Or that colossal nonsense goes American type, literature hotel literature, airport best-sellers, Or people jump on current events, on a book-document of journalistic cut. The novel, at least in Italy, no longer manages to keep up to the things that happen, that's why it doesn't sell. It's the usual story of reality that exceeds the imagination of any writer. Andrea is right. Right now readers are hungry for true stories. Or they buy best-selling spy novels. I mean, she was able to read those books, and follow their abstruse geometries. But there is a reason. In those plots, the numbers always add up. While in life they almost never do. Come on Andrea, let's not overdo it. My publishing house may be in crisis, but the problem is also another one. We have to try to get out from our small, asphyxiated Italian world. And we have to think and write in European. How do you find it Andrea, changed? - No, why? - I fell in love. - With whom? - With him! But you don't know how much! After 20 years, it's almost ridiculous. It seemed strange to me I was always agreeing with him today. At least I'll be quiet for a year. And then it will start all over again. Doctor? - Yes? What's going on? Francesco... KILLED. Francesco Mancini has been killed and also the men of the escort. Sorry, I have to go. Sorry. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello? Do you know who it is? Someone who has the wrong number. Carla. Wait, mom. I have to go to get something. Excuse me for a moment. How can you be so sure? I am sorry madam, I understand your pain very well, your anger, because that is what that we also feel, But his is a very serious accusation. You are making us understand that you are aware of the investigation - conducted by your husband? - No, I didn't say that. All I know is that he's come very high, maybe... All the way to the people who ordered his assassination, and that of Judge Mancini. Why don't you tell us exactly on whom your suspicions fall? - I will tell at the appropriate time. - Madam, may I ask you... what makes you want to go on this dangerous road? Anger, rebellion. I cannot think that the death of my husband was in vain. I think that each one of us has to start reacting. To take a risk. Even small gestures can serve. So you haven't forgiven your husband's murderers? No. Goodbye. Ma'am, I understand your reaction. It is the same as other women who have experienced your drama. I knew her husband well. I did several interviews with him for my news program. I know, I know his reports. My husband appreciated it very much. Madam, take my my business card. If you need anything, I would be glad to help you. You absolutely cannot continue like this! I understand your anger and I share it. What you're going around saying, it's very dangerous. Dangerous for you. I have nothing to lose. I would just like to know on what you base these suspicions of yours. Do you have any cards from Marco? Just intuition...logic. Logic, perhaps. It's dangerous for sure. I'll try to get you a stash for some time. No use at all! Marco got killed anyway. And you knew this was going to happen. Because otherwise he would have had to write a will, like the one he wrote? Everyone here is risking their lives, knowing that. Ah, you certainly do. Like Marco and Francesco. But many others just don't, the opposite. Carla, I have to beg you to change your attitude. I am old. And tired of so many dead friends. Fear not! Women don't kill them. Allow me to insist. Your presence on our electoral lists, would be an important signal, that you are serious about change. - I don't care, thank you. It is in Parliament that you can continue that battle that you started to do with your statements to the newspapers. Your proposal honors me, but it is not for me. I believe in democracy. But not in this democracy. It's been a long time since I've been here. When we still could it was Villa Adriana, our favorite walk. They say that at the event there will be 100-150.000 people. - Yes. - I've been asked to speak. - And are you going to do that? I've seen more of these great events and then everything stayed the same. - You're right. Protests or words aren't enough. Yes, it takes different things. Maybe that's why it's important your presence is important. No, I don't want People to cry over me. But I also don't want to fight a lonely battle. I know a lot of things. I absolutely have to be able to talk with Fantoni's wife. But Marco and Francesco, they killed them for it. I know. I know well. Mrs. Fantoni. I thank you for coming. I wouldn't have wanted to meet you like this, but I'm afraid I'm being controlled. I don't have much time, I have the children at home waiting for me. Your husband had started to cooperate with mine, Before they killed them together. Wait, I just wanted to know if he had confided in you. With our information together we might be able to get to the principals. No, I don't know anything, my husband never told me anything. Let me go, I have the children at home waiting for me! I'm afraid that's really true you know, that now only images can move people. Maybe this is the solution. - Andrea, can I make a phone call? - Of course! I am Carla Aldrovandi, I would like to speak to Mr. Ripa. Thank you. Good evening, I am Carla Aldrovandi. Good, thank you. But I would like to meet you. Okay. How do you feel towards your husband's murderer? I have no pity for my husband's murderers. I could kill them with my own hands. And then... I could go to the coffee shop, and quietly have a coffee. - That's a very harsh statement. - I know. When they killed my husband, I didn't want to believe it at first, I didn't want to do anything, I didn't want to leave the house. Then I thought that it was important to get out, because it's important to have courage. I was hoping to find around me someone to help me, But no one had the courage. And now I find this courage in her. I wouldn't feel safe anymore, I would be afraid for them. I couldn't possibly say who I am, even though I know who I am. I would put them in danger, I would put myself in danger too. I can't say any more than that. I can't bring myself to talk about him. Three weeks before I dreamt about the cemetery. Do you believe in God, ma'am? I do. God knows them. Do you want to tell them the names? I have already told them, but it was no use! It's like talking to deaf and dumb people. I wonder about women who have suffered the same pain as me, who can... say things that are definitely not true. I think that forgiveness is... a lie. A thing that cannot be heard. They killed my husband, they ruined my life, They ruined my daughter's life. I can't forgive such a thing. I have no faith in these people. Surely, many will say to me: "Maybe they repent, change their lives." I don't believe that at all. This is just the beginning. That's okay, Carla. You are creating a disturbing document. What do you need my testimony for? Nothing! I don't know what to say, I only know how to curse! I ran away from the city, and now I want to run away from here too! To go far away, I don't even know where! But I can't do it anymore. I can't do any more, except deliver this baby, and take care of my brother. What do you want me to do, you want me to talk too? I don't believe in anything anymore. Sorry. I understand you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I decided to help. Here, these are all the documents of my husband. Cancel the appointments for today, please. And if you want, you can go too. Thank you. Thank you. Come in, Carla. I'm sorry I can't accommodate you, but I'm leaving. As soon as possible. I know why you're here. For the same reasons, this morning I submitted my resignation. Effective immediately. Do you leave Power of Attorney? I'm leaving the judiciary. What else am I supposed to do? The results of the investigations of your husband and Francesco: I signed them. They won. No, the state lost. Maybe Marco and Francesco have come to an unnecessary end. But... at least they will never know to have been... mocked by the Court of Cassation, and to have involuntarily caused your resignation. They would have resigned as well. You can kill a magistrate even like that. These are the crimes of the state, Carla. Here, this is a list of payments. Made to foreign accounts, in favor of some politicians. I have a similar list. Perhaps more complete. And in here is all the accounting recorded in black. But I can't understand almost nothing. - All the names are in digits. - Don't worry. Your husband had given Marco the key to interpreting the acronyms. But this diskette is the only original one! It's very precious, it's thousands of acronyms. Can I ask you what changed your mind? My children. Aren't you in bed yet? Let's go. I'm tired too. I found this outside, on the way back. What is this? What does this mean? Nothing mom. Has anyone come looking for me? No, no one.
