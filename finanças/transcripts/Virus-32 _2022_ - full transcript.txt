What's going on here? What's going on here? What's going on here? Let's see.. You don't have any food. Dad didn't give you food. Well, I'll get you some. Mama will bring you some food. Jesus Christ, Simon. If I don't give him food, this little creature will starve to death. Simon? Simon? Simon? What’s the matter? Are you going to be all frowny like that? Why can't I stay with you? You're going to have a good time. Besides, it's been a long time since you've stayed with her. Because she doesn't want to. No, it's not that she doesn't want to. It's just that it's hard for mom to dare, you know, Tata? You and I have to help her, okay? What are you wearing today? Take whatever you want from my closet. Yes, maybe I'll take a jacket. Okay, but which one? You told me to choose whatever I want and now you ask me which one. Come on, Nicky. A message. Guess who. The 'one-eyed man'? Yes! What? No way. Guess. Hold still. - Guess. - The @ld man. - No! You're mean. No. I don't know who. I've lost track. I don't know. The Brazilian. The Brazilian! The toxic one. - No, you're the toxic one When do you see him? - Later tonight. Fuck, I have to go. Hold this. Wait. You always leave everything half-finished. Well, Nicky, you know how to do it. Sure, nobody cares about me. Nobody cares about me either. Please.. So you're seeing each other today? - Yes. Where? - At Dennis's. Oh, girl, wait! The scissors, put them in my backpack, would you? Both of them. I don't know where they are. I think they're at the table. Here, here. Put them in the backpack in the outside pocket. Do you need anything else? Yeah, money, Nicky. Money? No. From where? I don't have any money. Look who it is! Just a second! Your child. Your child is at the door. And I'm sorry, I'm not staying to watch the drama. No. I'm sorry. Fuck. Tata, honey... - What's this, Mom? Hello. No. Leave this here. You said you were gonna clean up. I didn't promise anything. Listen, honey, I love it when you come over, but I have to go to work today. I can't stay. Tata. Tata! Dad, the skateboard. Wait here. - What's wrong? Tata! I have to go! - Dad's here, come on. This is disgusting. Honey... forgive me, it's not that I don't want you to come, I love that you're here. I have to go to work, sorry. You smell like beer. It's not beer, it's rum. Rude. **Neighbor screaming while getting her ass chewed off by her husband** Javi - What's wrong with your neighbors? They seem to be killing each other. Javi, listen to me. You forgot... I forgot. I took an extra shift and I have to go now. We've argreed on this weeks ago, Iris. Can't you call and ask for a replacement? No, I can't call. You want me to get fired? I have to go in to work, Javi. I need you to step up and take care of Tata. Don't talk to me like that. She's your daughter too. Tata! I'm leaving! I'm leaving. Bye. Kiss. Take care of yourself, okay? I love you. How long will it take? I don't know, as long as the exam takes. I don't know how long. Well, as soon as you're free, pick her up at the club. But I'm telling you I can't. You're killing me, Javi. That is impossible. Good luck. Do you want to see where mom works? Come on. I'm going to get some cigarettes. Tata! Did he say anything to you? - No, nothing. Why is your cast so white? Nobody signed it for you? Hike it like this, with nothingm on it. Come with me. Come on, run, I'm late. Come on, come on! Come on, hurry up! This way. Come on, Tata, around the corner! You already tired? We're almost there. David! What happened to that car? No idea, it was already there. Is this your kid? Hi, princess. - Hello. Come on, Tata, hurry up! Tata, hide there, behind the car. Here? - Yes, right there. Wait for me there, I'll let you know. Stay there. Mom! VIRUS: 32 Mario! Coming! Marito. You don't need this job, do you? What did I do now? Look at the time you're getting here. Mario, I'm here. That's it. I'm gonna go punch in with my card. I've already punched it for you. I'm such a jerk. Thanks, Marito. When are you going to change your hair color? Nobody sees me here. I left you some fresh coffee. Let's get Married, Marito! Tata! Come here! Mom works here. Oh, that's Cabrera. Can I feed him? No, he's not hungry. He's fat from all the rats he eats. **...Six months after the sanitary crisis...** **...some data linked to an epidemiological report...** **...of the Ministry of Public Health as of September 4...** Do you want coffee? I have eight, mom. So? We put plenty of sugar in it. **...they got infected by being in contact with other people with the disease...** And you don't have a gun? It's not a good idea to give me a gun. What if someone comes in? Would you mess with this? I literally would. Literally fuck off. Where did you get that from? I certainly didn't teach it to you. Iris reporting. You'll probably learn a bad word, but certainly not that one. Don't break anything! Only Mom has the power. Come on, come on! Aren't you afraid of being alone here? No, afraid of what? Grandpa taught me not to be afraid. When I was about your age, your grandpa used to take me to the field near a farm, where super-poisonous snakes used to crawl around. He would give me a stick and then leave me stranded by myself. Did I ever tell you this? I had to stay still and be alert, just in case something moved. Which one do you like? Mom, the cast... So? Play with the other one. That one's a little deflated anyway. Which one is this? - What's this? Oh, these are torches. Look. See? I filled this whole place with smoke. They almost fired me. See why they don't give me a gun? Hold on, what if we take some pictures later? Didn't you say you almost got fired? said "almost", Tata. Come on. All of them. Come on. Put them here, come on. For fuck's sake. I have to continue the round. If I don't pass by the control every two hours, they'll think I've fallen asleep. In any other time, I'd be "resting my eyes". Come on. Stay here playing, I'll be right back and we'll play together. Are you going to leave me alone here? You can come with me and walk miles and miles of dark corridors. Come, look. Touch this button and call me. Okay? No matter what happens. Here. See that camera over there? Yeah? Look. I see you. Say hello. Come on. See? Don't worry, I won't be long. I'll be right back. Just play. Damn. Mom, Mom! Easy, Tata. It's a fuse that acts up every now and then. I'm scared! I know, I'm already going to fix it. Don't be scared, remember what I told you. you know what I used to do when I stayed in the grass waiting for a snake to come? I closed my eyes. No way I'd close them if there were snakes. Well, I learned that if I close my eyes and imagine I'm somewhere else, the fear goes away. What did you imagine? My hairdresser's. Bah, the one I wanted to have. The lights’ Better Now? - Yes! To this day when I walk through the dark corridors of this club, I imagine... the color of the chairs... or the design on the floors... or the showcase with the products, the marks of the hairdryers... and the fear goes away. Hey. Did I bore you? Tata. Did you see what day today is? Today would be Nico's birthday. I didn't remember. Do you remember when he turned one and we went to the beach? I'd think of that so I wouldn't be so afraid. Honey, I'm running out of battery on the radio. I'll come down as soon as I can, okay? Over and out. Over and out. **Screams of some Guy getting that ass whooped outside** No, no, no. 911... - Hello, I'm calling you from Club Neptuno. They're beating a man to death here in the street. Hello? - Don't hang up. No, no. Hello? No...Hello? Hello? David! Yeah - Did you see what happened? Its just some junkies from around the corner. It's between them. Just calm down, lock up, and stay inside. Yeah, but they were hitting that guy. I've already called the police. Tata. Tata, honey. Tata? Tata! Tata! Get out of here! You can't be here! What are you doing? Stop! Stop, man ! No, stop! David.. David.. Fuck. Fuck. **WORKSHOP** Go Ahead. Go, Tata. Pick up, Tata, come on. Honey. Mom, someone broke in! I know. Relax, honey. I can see you, remember? If you look in front of you, there's a camera. Where are you? I'm going to look for you. You have to stay there, okay? How long? - **Subtitler: What, You got somewhere else to be, little brat. LOL** Listen, behind you there's a column...you see it? Very good. There's a key with locks. Take one and lock yourself in there. Lock yourself in there. Don't open it for anyone, Tata, do you hear me? Don't open it for anyone unless you hear this. Got it? Okay, come on, go on. Mom? Come on. No, no... Where are you? No, no, no. Tata.. Hide, Tata. Yes.. Yes, hide. All right, all right. All right, honey. I'm coming, honey. What happened to you? 32 seconds. 30, 31, 32 seconds. They can't swim, they drown. Who are you? Sorry, I didn't introduce myself, I'm Luis. Healthy. You dont know what I mean? If you look at the hands of these guys, you'll see they have red marks. as if they had scars or something. Let's see yours. My daughter...is alone here at the club, I'm going to find her. Okay, I'll help you with that. But first you have to help me. You have to give me a hand with something that I can't do alone, okay? I'm here with my wife. We were in the ambulance and we were attacked. We crashed into this place. An ambulance? Yes, I was taking her to give birth. Let's go. It's like something was alerting me... It was like an instinct, or like.. a premonition. And I was always kind of indifferent to all that reading and everything. but as soon as I found out that Mimi was pregnant, I started reading, studying, taking classes. As if I had seen it coming. And now I am confident for the delivery. At first, I didn't want anything to do with being a father. Everytime my Old Man and my Brother would go fishing, I would stay on land filleting fish. I guess that's why, the idea of having a baby in my arms after always cutting, bugs me. Look at me now, I'm almost a midwife. Luis, I can't help you. I don't know how to do any of this, Luis. Don't worry, I will guide you. I studied everything. I will guide you, I can use an extra pair of hands. Besides, if one of these sick people shows up, someone has to take care of it. First I introduce you, then we get to work, okay? That's a pigeon. Raul. What? My son. He's going to be called Raul. Like his Grandpa. Hi, Mimi. I'm here. I brought Iris. She's going to help us bring Raul. Iris, this is Mimi. Iris. Iris. Let me out of here. Please, I'm begging you, really. I get it, we're going to be out of here in a moment. I beg you, Luis, I just want to look for my daughter, nothing else. I saved your life a couple of times, remember? She is infected, man. For now, yes. I don't know. I don't know if it's just a cold, you know? Maybe tomorrow it will go away. Or perhaps in a couple of hours, I don't know. The baby may also be sick. You are being cruel. If Tata were sick, would you abandon her? What did you say? I said if Tata were sick, would you abandon her? When did I tell you my daughter's name? **Subtitler: OOOHHHH SHIT!!!!!!!** No, she told me. She's nice. She has a cast and she let me sign it. You son of a bitch. No. Listen to... - Tata! Tata! I'll kill you.. Don't touch me.. Where's she? Where's my daughter? Tell me where my daughter is. - Your daughter is fine. She's safe. You want to see her and I'll help you. You have to help me first. You help me and then I'll help you. Is that clear? Is that clear? Yes? Good. Now we have to move Mimi because we're sitting ducks here. You understand? We're going to need something to disinfect. Do you know where there's a first-aid kit nearby? Iris, I'm asking you if you know if there's a first-aid kit nearby. Yes, in the infirmary there is a first-aid kit. Well, let's go there then. Where's my daughter? Tell me where's my daughter! Where is she? Where's my daughter, son of a bitch? Where's my daughter? Luis... Listen to me. This is not me. I'm a good guy, okay? But if you put my family at risk again... I'll kill you, I'll kill your daughter... I'll do anything, understand? Luis! Nod with your head so I can relax. Yes! Okay. This is madness, man. Well... Today is not a day to be scared of madness. A few days ago, these marks started showing on her hands. I thought it was an allergy, but... She started acting weird. She was kind of aggressive. Right, Mimi? One night I woke up... I didn't see her in bed. Instead she was out there... ...trying to open her belly with her nails. I realized she didn't know what she was doing. I thought she was dreaming, but... She had to be sedated ...and as of yesterday, she had to be tied up. What do we do now? We have to go through the pool. This morning, when I went to the dock to clean my old man's boat, ...one of these sick people showed up. He tried to attack me. But I pushed him and he fell into the water. He couldn't swim...he died. So... If everything goes well, I figured I'd take them out there to the boat. I think we will be safe in the water. There's room for you and your daughter too. Stop. There's one there. Stop. - What? Relax, Mimi. Iris, what are you doing?..... Iris! Iris. What are you doing? Javi. Javi. Relax, Mimi. Iris, they're coming. Tata? Tata.. Tata's okay. Tata's okay. Tata's safe. Nico? Is Nico with you? Nico is waiting for you. Today is his birthday. Yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. It wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault. He was so little. Whose idea was it to give him the pool? It was my fault, Javi. It was my fault. I got distracted. It was my fault. Relax, Mimi. Iris. Her water broke. We have to go, Iris. Easy, Javi. It's all right. Now you're going to have to take care of Tata. You're all she's going to have left. You can do it. You're killing me. That's impossible. Javi. Iris. It's done. Javi, look at me. It's done, Iris. We have to go. Iris, they're here. Iris. There is no escape. What are you doing? The car. They're here. They're everywhere. Now I'm going to have to shoot, they'll hear it and others will start coming. Iris. Iris, can you hear me? There's no way out. Help me. Help me here! - Yes. It's this way, follow me. Easy, easy. There it is. It's all right. Relax, Mimi. Relax. Easy, easy. Relax, relax, honey. There is it, there is it. It'll just take a second. Iris. Iris, go get something to disinfect. IRIS! Get something to disinfect! Easy. I'm not going to hurt you. Relax, relax. There it is. It'll just take a second. I got it. There is it. No, no, no, relax. It'll just take a second. Look for scissors. Scissors. It's okay. He's coming out. He's coming out. He's coming out. No, I can't. What? What's wrong? - Help us. What's wrong? He's coming out. Come here. - No, Luis. I can't, Luis. - Yes, yes. I'll tell you what you have to do. I dont even know where to begin. - I know...because I learned. Take him out now, stop fucking around! Stop fucking with me! Take him out! There's the Head! You see it?!?! Yes, I see it. - Grab him slowly. Easy, Mimi, it's okay. I'm with you, just a second, he's almost out. Just a second. He's coming. There he is. Luis... Slowly, slowly. - Yes, yes. There it is, there is it. Here. Slowly. What happens, Mimi? It's done, it's done. What are you doing, Luis? Luis! NO! Mimi, this will calm you down. No, no. -Yes Skin-to-Skin contact between Mother and Child is important. It's good for both mother and child. I learned that. He's so little, Luis. - Let me. I have to see the baby's hands. It's her child too. Even if it's only for a few seconds. Calm down, honey. The baby is healthy. SUBTITLER NOTE: There needs to be some Skin-to-Skin contact between a Foot to Luis's ass. Luis, it's been about 10 seconds, please! Mimi, look at him. Luis! Luis, its been 15 seconds, man! - Look at him, our baby is healthy. I know that somehow she recognizes him! Cut it, Luis! Please! Luis! No... Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis, where is the baby? Luis... Mimi.... Mimi. Yes, it's your baby, Mimi. Mimi, it's your baby. We're going home. Are we going home? Mimi, it's your baby. Do you recognize him? Mimi. Mimi. Mimi, no. Mimi, are we going home? Mimi, it's your baby. He is your son. Do you recognize him? It's your baby. Mimi. No, Mimi, no. Mimi, No! She was going to kill him. Was that man your husband? Yes. Is it true what he said? You let your baby drown. Luis. We have to keep going. Boiler room. Your daughter is in the boiler room. Tata. Tata. No! No! Tata... Honey! Darling, darling. Are you okay? Are you all right? -Yes. I'm sorry. You are here. Yes. I'm here. Your Mom's here. I'm here. Show me your hands. He took off my cast. And helped me hide. Luis? And he also looked at my hands. I know... He kept me safe and then he left. Then a man came with a girl about my age, I wanted to help them and open the door, but the others broke in. Honey, don't worry. Mommy's here now, okay? And her Dad tried to help us, but he couldn't. They threw her into the fire. SUBTITLER NOTE: HOT DAMN!!!! Calm down, darling. Listen to me. I'm going to get you out of here. The car is outside. We're going to get in the car, and drive down to the docks. we'll get on a boat and we should be fine at sea. Did Dad come? When we're at sea and we're safe and sound, I'm going to tell you everything, okay? I know I never promise you anything, but I promise you this, okay? They're everywhere. Mom. What? I feel something on my feet. Relax, okay? The corridor. We have to go through the green corridor. Its the only way out of the club. Listen to me. When I give you the word..We move, okay? No, no. It's the only way out. I can't make it. Trust me. Trust me. Don't look! Tata, don't look! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Get in, get in Mom, the wheel! Come on, get in, Tata! Get In! - Luis! - Luis! Did you find each other? If we open this gate, you can come in. Iris. If I don't make it, you'll have to take care of the kid. Go look for the 'Albatross'. Albatross? The boat. When you get out to sea, you'll be safe. Mom. Tata, turn around. What? Listen to me. Once you don't hear any more noise, you have 32 seconds to get out of here, you understand? Run and get to the sea. Run and get to the sea, Tata. Don't look at me. Promise me. Happy birthday, Nico. Mom! Mom! Mom! - Go on. Go on. No... There's no time left, Tata. Honey... Thats fine. This is the way it has to be. Yes. I love you. Go on. Run. Tata. Tata. Run, run. No! Run, Tata! Tata, run! There's no time, run, Tata. No! Are you all right? Are you ready? Yes.
