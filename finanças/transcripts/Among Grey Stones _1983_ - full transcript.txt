Oops. Do you remember maman? Have you done your homework, Master? No. No what? What's wrong with you? Go home. Do you remember? Do you remember maman? Do you remember how she taught you to read? Do you remember how she taught you to read? Do you remember her voice? Do you remember maman? Do you remember maman? Do you remember maman? Things don't obey me. Things don't obey me. What a heavy spoon. The window won't open. The child won't sit still. Here's a yellow flower, here's a red flower, here's a white flower. What a heavy blue flower! The flower is heavier than the spoon. There's blood. I'm afraid of blood. I'll present you with binoculars, and Sonya - with another doll for children to remember their mother. I forbid everything! I do not recognize truces and neutrality! I am general Turkevich! I am general Turkevich! I forbid everything! Everything! I forbid hypocrisy! I am a general, and I won't have anyone spitting in my porridge! I forbid everything! I forbid everything! I forbid everything! Why do you sit all silent Hugging the window, old gran? Has the howling of the storm Wearied you, at last, dear friend? Or are you dozing fitfully... Basements and ruins of the former count's castle... Basements and ruins of the former count's castle... are to be cleaned. Are to be cleaned. Sojourn and overnight stay... Sojourn and overnight stay... are forbidden... are forbidden... for those without permanent residence... for those without permanent residence... and decent occupation. And decent occupation. Taking into account the recommendations of his Excellency sojourn in the ruins of the castle is allowed for former servants of his Excellency according to the presented list... Jean, simply Jean... Justice, high justice... Here you are, some demand justice, some roof above their heads. Did you have to smoke? I'm gifted with understanding, with understanding and knowledge, on stormy autumn nights I clearly heard the screams coming from below the ground. It's Turks on whose bones the castle was built. Those are Turks screaming underground, loudly reproaching old count for cruelty, while weapons are glittering in the hall, and captains are summoning cossacks. Let him throw as he wants, it's his business! Don't impose your own rules! Mind your own, or you'll lose your last! Hey! Let me have a bite of your apple! Master, let me have a bite of your apple, please! My name is also Vasya. Once I even clearly heard the Count's late great grandfather riding and screaming, "Shut up, heretics! Shut up, heretics!" Go away! I'm a valet. Yes, Jean. - My grandfather was a valet. - Yes, Jean. - My great grandfather was a valet. - Yes, Jean. I'm also a valet, not some Turk or Zulu. No, no. Yes. I'm a valet. Yes, Jean, yes. When a southwester gusted from behind the reed poplars were swinging loudly, and through them windows were shining, and the castles seemed to cast a gloomy glance... The Count's descendants have long ago abandoned the place of their ancestors. But we are their loyal servants. Your Honour! Your Honour! Bravo, Jean! Look! But this is an onion! Have seen many times during the day... Your Honour! How is your papa? And your maman? Are they in good health? They are. Now sod off! Thank God, Sir. Great. How are your children? Are they in good health? And your spouse? I used to have both money and children. And now I have nothing. My father was a military man so he was on the move all the time, and we too. You know, as his family. What's the time? We don't know the time. Have a smoke then? We don't have a smoke either. If you smoke, have your own tobacco. I stand for private property. You have money for wine, don't you? Then you should have some for tobacco too. You tried to beat up general Turkevich? I forgive you as a Christian, however, as a nobleman I can't tolerate it. You'll atone with your blood! Take this! I don't recognize truces! I don't recognize neutrality! I forbid everything! I forbid everything! I forbid everything! I forbid! I forbid everything! You know very well, I forbid hypocrisy and dying one's hair. Mother. I had a sister, but no parents. They say habit is second nature. He was elderly, although it was difficult to identify his age. Welcome, Sir Valentin! Sir Valentin can stay, Sir Valentin speaks Latin. Sir Valentin and and two or three of his close friends. Please, make yourself at home. Welcome Sir, you can stay. I'm sly, you know. If I see you alone in the woods, I'll slit your throat. And here and I bow before you. What for? Sir Valentin, what for? Your Excellency! There's been a mishap. Your Excellency! An old man died suddenly. His name is Jean. Sir Valentin, what for? You must have misunderstood me! You can stay! Me? Here? With you? Me? I don't live here! Mr Professor. Your Excellency! Shut up, stupid old man! I won't have anyone spitting in my porridge! No way! I'm general Turkevich! I'm a general! Now, the son of venerated parents can easily visit our castle, for he will find there a decent society, a homogeneous and a close-knit circle. Why have you banished those people? I don't like it. Those are not people. You yourself? Who are you? You're a beggar! You're a beggar! Don't weep, I'll give you some sweets! Don't wail, I'll tell you a tale! A wanderer's lot is the road. It's nice to go in the night, dear Sir, fields are enveloped in darkness, in a grove nearby a nightingale sings. Where are you going to? To Paris. Or somewhere nearer. To Italy, or something like that. Me and my sister are the best people in town. Thanks. All these creatures are like us, my friends all these graveyard worms relieve themselves in an unknown way... In reverse direction! Look at the birds in the sky, signors... we don't sow, don't reap and don't fill the granaries... We are surrounded by nutrient medium existence of which, from the point of view of animal economy, should be acknowledged as perfect, because drawing as much as possible from life with minimum energy consumption, isn't it the main principle of adaptation? And adaptation, gentlemen, is the law of life! Good morning, gentlemen. Good evening! Bon soir! What do you mean, evening? Not morning, evening. Spending a lot of time underground, one loses track of time. I haven't been out for a week. Add to this insomnia, stress... Bon soir! Lend me your shawl! No way. No way. Anyway, be it morning or evening, welcome! Where...? In reverse direction. It's damp at our place. But I think that it's not the place but one's individuality that determines the extent to which one can be happy. After all, even being in the same place, people still exist in different worlds. What is only a curious incident for a sanguine person is a tragedy for a melancholic one. And a phlegmatic person won't even pay attention. We ourselves are the source of all our pleasures and sufferings. Everyone, bow to a goat! Everyone, bow to a goat! Stop stealing! Stop hiding then! Is growing terrible! His eyes are glittering with madness. Wipe your feet! I'm coming to expose the heretics! Careful! Blue flames will now kindle. All the geese are sleeping, all the ducks are sleeping, Only you are not sleeping, Cooking the hand All the geese are sleeping, all the ducks are sleeping, Only you are not sleeping, Cooking the hand Give me a bite of your apple! I'm not afraid of the cemetery, my mother is here. Take it all out, it's all unnecessary. Take it all out, all of it. It's all unnecessary. Trouble. Spit it out. Shame. Take it. Open your mouth, wider. Take it all out, all of it. Take it to the blue room, it's opened. Nothing unnecessary - just a chair, a table and a bed. Man should be free and alone. And children must go an orphanage then? Free and alone. And children must go an orphanage then? And unattached. To the blue room. Go away! To the blue room, the blue one! Take it all out, my wife is dead! You can burn or sell all of it! Why have you brought it here? Why? I want to be healed. I want to be healed. I want to be healed. I want to be healed. It can be glued back together. It can be glued back together. And you, stand on one foot! The other one is unnecessary, huh? Stand on one foot! And how many unnecessary words! Say only 'yes' or 'no'! Since for him all is unnecessary. It can be glued back together. What, my dear? My dolls, dad isn't going to throw them away, is he? No, we won't let him to. Does this also go to the blue one? Yes. Go round the children. No, Sonya, brother is not our company. Who knows what he might be like. Get away from her! Sonya, we'll go play with the dolls now. I told you to get away from her! I told you to get away! Get away! Take that! Take that! Go to your room, please! Nothing can be taken from children's rooms, or I'll leave! Go to your room, I said! Love does not suppose justice. Love hurts, love is hard, and, of course, love is not just. You see, I loved your mother too much, and now I'm punished. I can't forget her. I want to forget and I can't. Why is it that one wants a cake so much, and then one is so disgusted? Love and hate multiply injustices of the world which is already unjust. See how he resembles mother? No, she has red cheeks and she's fat. Yes, I have red cheeks and I'm fat. I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful. You've forgotten her. Why can't I fogey? Look at my hands, look at my feet! I'm a ball, I bounce like a ball! Have you done your homework? Yes. Where are your binoculars? Have you lost them? Dad, it's holidays now, there's no homework. Yes, children are healthy, children all well fed, and health, they have everything they need, they'll grow up and... Are you satisfied with your life, children? Are you satisfied with your life? I asked you, are you satisfied with your life? Yes. - You've lost your binoculars. - Yes. - Do you know who you are? - Yes. I'm a bad spoilt boy with a callous and egoistic heart. You think I'm unjust towards you, don't you? Being just means rendering according to one's deserts and fulfilling one's duty. What about Sonya? Sonya isn't to be loved? Sonya is your sister, it's your duty. Your duty. No. An inkpot is necessary, take it back. Yes, go on. You're right. The door is closed, it's fastened with nails. How did you get in? I know what you want! I have some more apples! I have some more apples! I have some more apples... Hang on. Hey! Why have you come here? Have I ever come to your garden? I like you, what's your name? I'm inviting you! I'm not supposed to play with you. Why? Because your father is a judge. So what, you're going to play with me, not with my father. Ok then, my name is Valyok. Mine is Vasya. Stay there, I'll lead you another way. Just don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, I'll just lead you another way. Don't be afraid. Careful, don't be afraid. Marusya, where are you? Is that you, Marusya? Marusya, I can't see anything. I can't see you, Marusya, where are you? Marusya? Where are you? I can't see you. I can't see anything. Marusya, where are you? Marusya? Marusya, where are you? I can't see you. Come here, come to me. Come here, come to me. Stands a mountain high and steep In it lies a cavern deep, In this cave in shadows dismal Sways a coffin, made of crystal. Master, spare some change! Your maman's always spared us some change. I don't have any change, take my cross if you want. Give me your hat! Let's exchange! Look what I've got. It's nice, isn't it? One, two, here comes a goat... A judge, big and terrible, proudly strutted about his old dark castle alone. Everyone trembled at the sight of him, going in his carriage to the downtown market. Mr Judge! Let's diaper it. A doll! One, two, here comes a goat. One, two, here comes a goat. Marusya, run, I'll catch you! Are you crying? She just doesn't like playing. It's because of dampness and grey stone. Grey stone sucks the life out of one, that's what Valentin says, he knows. Valentin knows. Grey stone sucks the life out of one? It must be happening at night. Do you want to get out? Is there another way out? Be patient. You've pull my hat on my eyes again, don't you believe me? You know what Valentin says, "Necessity has its own laws, and it forces me to act this way." Who eats flowers? No one eats flowers. Who eats flowers? No one eats flowers. No one gives me apples. Shut up! I told you to shut up! Don't bite me! Here, eat! Hey! You won't tell anyone? He won't tell anyone. I won't. Let's go. The don't have a home. They live underground. I'm a ball, I'm a ball, I bounce like a ball! And who are you? I know who you are! You're a beggar. I'm a spoilt boy. You're a little rogue. You've got bad inclinations. Beggar, night owl. Rogue, scoundrel. Shame. You should have been in bed a long time ago. Is it a collar? You're a rogue. You late mother personally presented me with this kerchief. Don't you dare say that, it's mother's collar. All right, take it if you want, it's yours, but your late mother... Don't you dare say that, it's mother's collar. And I don't like this word. - Which word, a 'kerchief'? - No, another one. Alright, let is be a 'collar' then, nut your late mother... No! Don't you dare say that, I don't like this word! But your late mother... A cat ate a bird today. Is a cat evil? No, it's hungry. Now sleep. Do you feel sorry for a bird? I feel sorry both for a bird and for a cat. Now sleep. What's going on? It's broken down all by itself, I have nothing to do with it. Why have you forsaken us? Why have you left us? Maman! Who will look after your poor orphans? Mr Judge, I'm very inventive. They say, I used to be a tutor once. I have a limitless supply of jokes and witticisms, I myself grow faint under the weight of my paradoxes. The doors of best restaurants are opened to me, proficient knowledge of sorcery is also attributed to me. I can't find words to express this, although I've lived in Petersburg for a long time, where there are words for all purposes. And if you arrive in our town from the East, you'll no doubt notice our best piece of architecture - a prison. It's a beautiful building, isn't it? Oh, a church is also beautiful, of course. Don't take away your hand, Mr Judge. Why are you looking at me like this? Yes, I'm a beggar. You're feeding me, but I'll still tell you who you are, and criticize your food. Gentlemen! I'm Valentin! Your most humble servant. The most wonderful personality I've ever met. The most complicated nature. Money is nonsense. Money is nonsense. Money is nonsense. Valyok! Why are you screaming? Who are you? I asked, who are you? I'm not afraid of you. Why are you screaming? I'm Vasya. I see you for the first time. You've forgotten me. I doubt. I don't know you, bug off. Look at me, and you'll remember. You'll remember my face. Ah, here is your face. How about that? Do you remember now? I do now, you're Vasya. Can I come again? Invite me. Alright, I'll take that risk, there's no one home. I'll hang you above the fire and fry you. Good nourishing boy. It's not true, he doesn't eat boys. I didn't before, but now I'll have one. I've got nothing to eat. You haven't brought anything for me. Here, take. I'm just kidding. We'll have a dinner today, Marusya"ll have a dinner today. How many times do I have to tell you? Don't take anyone here! You've made a mess out of this place! You don't wipe your feet! I'll punish you severely! It's not a hotel! Not an orphanage! - You've got a silver voice. - It's not a poorhouse! I've lost my mattress. Or maybe it's been stolen. Look at Marusya. Look how beautiful she is. Delicate hair, clear eyes. Her eyes are just glittering of fever. Don't you understand? Now don't you say that! Why do you give her apples? Who told you to do this? Why do you give her apples? I'm asking you! Listen, boy, who sent you here? No one, I came here by myself. What for? I'm curious. Exploring life, are you? Rummaging in rubbish? Mr Judge visits the poor. Yes, he does. Mr Judge gets angry! You've got a sitting room, a hall - Earthly Heaven. Will you judge us? I'm not a judge, I'm Vasya. That doesn't make any difference. I'm a beggar and he's a beggar. I steal and he will. Your father judges me, and you will someday judge him. No, I'll never judge him. Boy, don't make promises you can't keep. Everyone has their one way. And when you will judge him, remember the time when you were both fools and played together. You followed your way in trousers and with good food, and he - in ragged clothing and with empty stomach. Besides, if Mr Judge learns that you've been here, - you'll remember this day... - I won't tell anyone, ever! I will never betray you, Valyok. I'll never... Can I come again? Alright, you can. You were born under the sign of Virgo. You were born under the sign of Virgo. Your stone is emerald, which signifies eventual settling down... Old age... Beware blondes, avoid eating fish. Valyok and Marusya, are their your children? Yes. Marusya! - Do you know who I am? - Who? I'm a young wolf. Am I too? No, you're a hound, you're hunter, chase me! What do you need it for? I pity him. You pity him? So you pity him. You... As a child I dreamt about catching a bird. Then I caught it and got disillusioned, because as soon as you catch a bird, you want to let it out. He must be asking you, why do we live like this? - Like what? - Not like everyone else. No, he's not. But he will. And why do we live like this? Yes, why do we live like this? Because of the circumstances. You pity me too. Me? You pity everyone. I pity the ones I love. And the ones you don't love? - I pity them too. - You pity them too. And me, I don't know how to live. Just sleep. Valyok and Marusya are your children? You're their father? Yes, they are mine, boy. I dare anyone to try and take them from me! Do you know such a man? So tell him, he won't get out of it alive. No, just tell him... I want to be with them, and they want to be with me, we feel good together. Children are my support, my joy, my comfort. - They are real. - Dinner is served. Goodbye. You must be hungry. Mother taught you how to be a well-mannered boy and not to disturb hosts when they sit down to table. I used to have a mother. Really? I didn't. I only had a sister. No, I didn't. Would you be so kind to have dinner with us? Mr Professor, get to the table. I like my soup hot. It has to be hot, mind you. Here's how little man needs. Now that we're full, we should thank God and priests. Yes, yes. You're saying 'yes', but you don't know what priests have to do with it. A priest gave it to you? Yes, his Holiness gave us this meat. Although his left hand didn't know what his right one was doing. And I think both his hands had no idea whatsoever about it. You just took it, didn't you? He's a smart kid. Soup, soup! Finally, you've expressed your thought appropriately. I've almost thought this kid is smarter than some scholars. Stealing is bad. It's only a prejudice. Why bad? It's unfair. You see, it's substituting one dubious term with another one, equally as dubious. Dear Vasya, honesty and all the rest is nothing but dessert. And dessert is served after dinner. No dinner, no dessert. Soup, soup! Unlike you, she understands. Tell me, Marusya, was it good of me to bring you this roast? Yes. Marusya was hungry, and now she's full. See how little man needs. That's how little man needs. Do you want anything else? Do you need anything else? A doll. The storm wind covers the sky Whirling the fleecy snow drifts, Now it howls like a wolf, Now it is crying, like a lost child, You don't like it, right? Of course, you don't. I can see it. Feeling uncomfortable, huh? Uncomfortable. That's right. Some eat, others watch. It's like that. Chew, swallow! Swallow! Chew! May God help this peace not to get stuck in your throat so that you can successfully digest it to the good of your organism. To the good of your organism, right? Go on, chew! - Swallow! - Chew properly! Enough already! Enough! He says, "If you don't finish your soup, you won't get any ice-cream." Nanny says, "He doesn't have a..." She then says, "I'll put on my shawl and go wherever I want." I also have a father but he doesn't love me. He's bad. Valentin says that the judge is the best person in town, because he even condemned a count once. It's no joke condemning a count. Why? Because he has money, carriages, servants. He's not an ordinary man, he's rich. Can you imagine, this count came to our house and started screaming, "I can buy and sell anyone!" And so father told him, "Go away!" That's it. See, Valentin also says your father is not afraid of banishing a rich one. And when old Ivaniha came to him, he ordered to get her a chair. I'm a judge, go away! I'll fry you up! I'm a famous count, I'll buy and sell everyone, I'll run over everyone with my carriage. And I'm a judge, go away! Go away, or I'll get angry! I'm stronger! Go away, and bring a chair finally! I'm stronger! Leave your crutches, granny! Count is stronger. ... Go away from here! Count is stronger. Judge is stronger. Count is stronger. Go away from here! Where's Marusya? Marusya wants to go home. Marusya wants to go home. Marusya wants to go home. Where is your home? Why do you want to go home? It's damp there, and here it's sunny. - The sun is burning. - It's stuffy there, and here it's windy. The wind is gusting. Home, home. Oh God, how many times did I say... Something gets lost - the cook is to blame! A cup breaks - the cook is to blame. A knife is lost - the cook is to blame again. What happened? I'm always the one to blame, that's what's happened! Something gets lost - the cook is to blame. I'm not the only one in this house! They're always stealing knives from me. It has to be around here! I know where the knives are! That's what happened with a fork last time! I'll find it! Go away, children are sleeping! Sleeping? I bet they are! Go away! She lost a knife. She says, it's a good one. She thinks it's you. And I thought, why wake you up for no reason? Why wake children up so early? You won't tell anyway, even if you take a knife. You won't tell if you take it, right? Right? It's pointless to search. Don't open the window, we won't air the room today. - Why? It's stuffy here. - No, it's not. - It is. - It's not. Take your shoes. Such an unusual caterpillar, it ate everything. I remember, in 1872... No, in 1871. I remember it vividly. A caterpillar ate everything. Nobody wants this chair, apparently. It's master's. He's a strict but fair man. He threw away all the chairs. One has to dig carefully if one wants to transplant afterwards, in order not to damage the roots. Otherwise, it will wither. This chair can come in handy. Master! You don't climb trees any more, why? Does your cape get in the way? You want me to climb a tree? So, you want me to climb a tree? I can present you with a wolf-mask, if you want! Do you remember, how she sat in front of the open window and watched an autumn landscape, saying farewell to it during the last year of her life? - You don't remember, do you? - No, I don't remember anything. You have grown to resemble a small animal. Long live warm clothing! Long live warm clothing! Sweet little innocent orphan! Why do you never come to us? We're waiting! Where is doll Katya? Where is doll Katya? Where is it? Mischievous doll! Sonya is angry with you! I can see you underground, even without glasses. I want Katya! I want Katya! Where is Katya? It's strange, where is Katya? That's where she is, our Katya! You're looking for a knife? Here it is. Where is this mischievous doll? Let's go look what father's doing. Maybe Katya is there. Father has a headache, maybe she's come to treat him. Maybe she's come to treat him. When will someone have this door oiled? Let's go, Sonya, father has a terrible headache. My life is over. My life is over, I'm sure. I still have fear of height. I still remember rules of grammar. But these outer signs won't fool me. Life is over. There's a kind of grey stone, it sucks life out of one. Is everything alright? What are you reading? Jules Verne? Is it from Jules Verne? I don't want to limit your freedom. Love is limitation of freedom. Man should live alone and free. Why? What for? - Why is Sonya crying? - She's being capricious. Mr Judge! Small flower has fallen ill. Small flower has fallen ill. I'll comb your hair. Hello. Marusya! She felt better in the morning. She asked about you. I couldn't come in the morning. Everyone's looking for a doll at home. Take it back then. She won't notice anyway. Small flower has fallen ill. How will she get by now? Ok, they must have forgotten by now. Old Jean came to my father and said something about you, but too quietly. And father screamed at him, "Go away, stop bothering me, you're just an old beggar! I don't believe a single word you're saying! What do you want from those people?" And then he shouted, "Quiet!" and gave him a coin. Bad news. This damned old hyena. My father banished him. Although, he then took pity on him and gave him another coin. I've also noticed that the more he shouts, the more money he then gives. I wouldn't like to get into the judge's clutches! Is he evil? He's not evil, he's just a judge, a j-u-d-g-e. He's kind, he knows a lot. Perhaps, he knows everything what Jean wanted to tell him. But he remains silent. He doesn't want to disturb an animal in its last den. How can I explain this to you? Your father serves a master whose name is the Law. He has eyes and a heart only while the Law is sleeping on its shelf. But when the Law gets down from its shelf and tell your father, "Now, Mr Judge, let us deal with this, what's-his-name, Valentin." Then judge locks his heart with a key, and then he's got really strong clutches! - He has hands, not clutches. - Hands? For you they are hands. But for him they are clutches. And for me they are clutches. Don't you understand? A clash occured, don't you understand? An unexpected quarrel! Don't ask me! Don't ask me! I won't speak! An everyday accident happened! Enough now! I'm starting to beat around the bush about life in general and mine in particular. Apparently, we'll have to leave. As soon as she gets well, we'll leave. What about me? When you grow up, you'll be a general, like me! - You're a nobleman like me, aren't you? - Yes. Do you like it? Take it. - Thanks. - Go now. I like villains. I understand robbers. If one man has a lot and another was has nothing, what is there left to do for the one who has nothing? He also wants something. You pretend to be sleeping, don't you? Now listen. I forbid you to go out. I'm busy at the court tomorrow morning. But in the evening I'll be talking to you. I have never punished you, have I? I've never beaten you. You know all the words, you know all the answers! You're strong, you're tall, you do everything the right way! Now it howls like a wolf, Now it is crying, like a lost child. - You took your sister's doll? - Yes. I'm trying. Do you see? I'm trying. But I feel I don't have any influence on him. Come here! No one limits your freedom. Do you understand? Do you understand that no one limits your freedom? - Who did you give the doll to? - I won't say. - You will. - I won't. - Of course, you will. - I won't. - You will. - I won't. You will. I won't. I'm not a traitor, I love them! I see the boy is used to reproaches. Mr Judge, you're an honest man, leave the boy alone. The boy spent time in a bad company but he didn't do anything wrong. If he likes my little ragamuffins then order to have me hanged, but I won't allow the boy to suffer. Leave the boy alone. You won't get anything from him with threats. But I'll willingly tell you everything you want to know. - Let's go to another room. - What about Marusya? Everything's quite clear, isn't it? I'm grateful to you. I'm grateful to you indeed. I was wrong about you. I was wrong about my son as well. But one can know a person only from one side while thinking that's all there is to it. But a person has multiple facets. - Do you fancy a drink? A snack? - There's no table here though... We asked and begged but you wouldn't listen. I like neither wine nor transformation of personality induced by it. Which door is the exit? Sit down. I myself was infected with death. I was ill with death. And you, you've healed me. Death is decomposition. And so I started decomposing everyone, myself included. You see, she said, "Make me a wreath." And she died. Before her death, she cut her finger, and cried of pain. Then she died. Doesn't make any sense, does it? There's no one to ask what this all is about. Who are you? What's your life like? My life? Like nothing. My life is not real, I think I'm not living at all. Everything is blurry, unremarkable years pass by. Fragments of memories. I can eat or forgo eating. I can live without eating altogether, it's my secret. I can do anything, but what for? Don't you believe me, I'm sly. Come to us. Father will let you come and say goodbye to my little girl. She died. Go. Go, say goodbye. Go, say goodbye. Stop. No, go. No, wait. Hang on. Give this money to Valentin and tell him that I ask him - do you understand? - I ask him to accept it from me. Dad! I have a present for you. I'm at fault towards you. When she was alive I didn't notice you because of my happiness. Then I didn't notice you because of my grief. I hope someday you'll forget about it. Is there Sonya in the portrait, next to mother? It's you. Yes, it's you. Marusya was little, Marusya was little, Marusya was poor, Marusya was poor, Marusya was kind, Marusya was kind, Vasya, give Marusya some apples, Vasya, give Marusya some apples, Vasya, give Marusya a hand, Vasya, give Marusya a hand.
