KOZURE OKAMI (Lone Wolf and Child) ASSASSIN ON THE ROAD TO HELL (Meifumado no Shikaku-nin) It is the mid Tokugawa era when tranquility reigned. However; This traveler and his son knew no peace. OGAMI Itto: TAKAHASHI Hideki. The man was Ogami Itto. His son was called Daigoro. It was a hard, merciless journey. An aimless journey with no end in sight. Directed by: TANAKA Tokuzo. - Such lightning speed... No wonder you are the feared Lone Wolf and Child, former official decapitator, Ogami Itto. I am Ayabe Ukon, vassal to Lord Matsudaira Kii of the Kameyama clan. I beseech you to aid our troubled fief. - You wished to test my skill just now? - I have 100 ryo. I understand that you will kill for 500 ryo. Here is 15 of the amount as security. - Before I accept, I wish to hear the details of the situation. - Besides myself, four others will appear to test your prowess. Each will hand over 100 ryo and give you more details. - You are from the Kameyama clan? - I am Tsunekawa Shume... - And I am Miura Gennai. - Your target is shogunate Inspector-General Yagyu Bizen-no-kami. - What? - You, yourself, harbor deep grudges against the Yagyu. Surely, you will see this through for us? - The Yagyu...? - In the time I have left, I will tell you what I can. The heir to the Kameyama clan is, in fact, a girl. - What? - Our lord is no longer young and he had no sons. So his first child, a daughter, was raised as a young lord, and formally declared to the government as his heir. The Yagyu agents got wind of the masquerade, and Inspector-General Bizen-no-kami is now headed for our clan to verify his agent's report. He must be killed or our clan is ruined. Ogami-dono... I beg you...! Accept this job. - Pa... - Isn't he cute? - Daigoro, how often must I say this? She is not your mother. Your mother went to the netherworld long ago. Forgive us. - It's all right... - Pa! - Here's 100 ryo... - another fifth of your fee. - Three have passed my way. Now the fourth, a woman. And skilled no less. Your name. I am page to Lord Matsumaru... heir to the Kameyama clan... Shirasaka Namie. - And when will the fifth appear? - Magnificent! You are the one and only Lone Wolf and Child. I am lyama Chonosuke, chief page of the Kameyama clan. The final hundred ryo is inside this shrine. Inspector-General Yagyu Bizen has entered our domain... and it seems that Yagyu Retsudo himself is pulling the strings. - Retsudo? - Please, Ogami-dono... - Go to Kameyama Castle quickly! - You are Ogami Itto-dono? - Correct. - I am Miwa Mondonosho, Kameyama clan chief councilor. I thank you for coming to help our lord. - You've slit your belly? - In atonement... - the situation has changed. Please forget we sought your services and leave. I beseech you. - Then those five vassals will have died in vain. Here are their locks. Let me at least bury them and offer a prayer. - Please wait! You were too late. The Inspector-General is already inside. - Chief councilor... 1 will take the 500 ryo and their locks inside to make certain the five loyal vassals find eternal peace. Open the gates! I am former official decapitator, Ogami Itto. I demand an audience with Lord Matsudaira Kii! - I am Matsudaira Kii. You will die here, Ogami. - For what reason? - For the ruthless slaying of five of my retainers. - As I thought. - Make way! I am Inspector-General Yagyu Bizen-no-kami. Lord Kii, why the hesitation? Kill Ogami! I promised you but moments ago that your clan would be spared if you killed Ogami Itto. - You can believe the Inspector-General if you so choose, but it does not erase the fact that you masqueraded your daughter as your male heir. - Enough! - Kill him! - You are... Yagyu Gunbei! - Correct. You fall into our hands again, Ogami. This too, was the ingenious plan of our father, Yagyu Retsudo. - Retsudo... - We knew of the Kameyama clan's secret three years ago. But we bided our time before abolishing the clan. And just as expected, the Kameyama clan hired you for their assassin. And again, just as we surmised, you came to Kameyama and killed the Inspector-General. But he was a stand-in. The real Inspector-General, Yagyu Bizen-no-kami, is here! - Matsudaira Kii, I have the shogun's orders! - Yes, sir. - If you disinherit Matsumaru and adopt another heir, the clan will be spared any punishment. - Is that true? - However there is one condition. You must kill Ogami Itto. - You fools! - You let Ogami Itto escape?! - I am deeply ashamed. But we have the entire area surrounded. - Bizen...! - Sir! - Gunbei. - Sir! - How will you pay for your blunder?! Get him without fail! If he escapes a second time, sons or not, there will be ho mercy! Sir. - I shall have your hides! Sir. - Damn you, Yagyu! - The Tokugawa maintained a rigid control over the daimyo lords. They exercised three options in keeping the lords in line. One was the placement of secret agents of the Kurokawa in various fiefs to spy on indiscretions that could mean abolition. Another was the use of the Yagyu assassins to get rid of any who opposed Tokugawa policies. And finally, there was the official shogunate executioner, the duty bestowed upon the Ogami family. - Welcome home, sir. - Welcome home. It is nice to have you back. - You look pale, Azami. - Is anything amiss? - No. - Tell me. - I've had a lot of bad dreams lately. - Dreams? - Of those you've decapitated... There is a sea of blood... And horrifying screams... - How silly! - And so unlike you. SEVERAL DAYS LATER... Azami...! Daigoro...! Azami...! Daigoro...! Azami...! Daigoro...! - Dear... Daigoro... Take care of Daigoro... - Azami! Who did it? Who did this? I shall not rest until I find them! I swear vengeance! - On the surface it looked like the work of embittered vassals whose lord had been ordered to commit suicide. In truth, it was a treacherous plot. Memorial tablets of each executed daimyo were placed on the Ogami family altar. Someone, somehow, had placed a memorial tablet of the shogun who was very much alive. Its disclosure brought a swift and merciless sentence. This was the Yagyu scheme. The Yagyu coveted the position of shogunate decapitator. They sought to control all three offices of covert operations, as shogunate secret agent, assassin, and decapitator. - Daigoro, the central government has ordered us to die. However, I intend to defy them and escape from this house. Hereafter, I will walk the path of vengeance as a hired assassin. And I will avenge the Ogami family of the humiliation wrought upon us by the Yagyu. Daigoro, you must choose your own destiny. Choose the sword, and you too, will be an assassin. Choose the ball, and I will let you join your mother in death. You may be too young to understand. But the Ogami blood which courses through your veins will know which to choose. Choose, Daigoro! You would find peace if you joined your mother. Poor child! A lone assassin and his child. Heed this well, Daigoro, for this is our fate. - I am Inspector-General Yagyu Bizen-no-kami. I come on official duty! - Bow to the shogun's decree! "Shogunate decapitator, Ogami Itto." "For your insolent action against my name, you are hereby relieved of your duties." "The House of Ogami shall be abolished and you and your son are ordered to commit seppuku." - I see you are already dressed to die. Admirable, Ogami Itto. You are a true samurai. What's wrong? - These are not death robes. Rather, as of this moment, we celebrate our rebirth into a life of vengeance. - What's that?! - How dare you defy the shogun's orders! - Since we have just rejected our old lives, the shogun's order is a laughable trifle. - Have you gone crazy?! - Hey! Hey! Ogami Itto has lost his mind! Kill him! - It's useless! I'm not blind. - What? - I know this is all a Yagyu plot. That the real mastermind pulling the strings from behind the curtain is none other than your father, Yagyu Retsudo. - I am impressed, Ogami. - Father! - Retsudo! - Ogami Itto. It's useless to resist. Accept your fate and cut open your belly. Otherwise, we will slay you. Even with your Suio "Horse-slashing" style of swordsmanship, you are no match for the Yagyu. - I wonder about that. - At him! - Know that when you attack me, you attack this crest, namely, the shogun! Even the Yagyu would not dare that! - It was against the samurai code for a man of lesser rank to execute a daimyo. Hence, the shogunate decapitator wore special robes marked with the shogun's own crest. - Make way! - Wait. Itto, remove those robes. And fight us as an equal. And if you win, you are free to leave Edo. - Father, that would mean disobeying the shogun! - Silence! 1 will take responsibility. 1 will send my youngest son, Yagyu Kurando, against you. - Agreed. - Kurando will have the setting sun on his back... and Ogami Itto will have his son. If they are evenly matched in skill, favorable positioning will decide the duel. Our victory is assured. - Daigoro, our journey through the gate of hell is about to begin! As if Retsudo would keep his word. But with my injury... And Daigoro... - Daigoro patiently waited for his father. He knew that his father would survive any battle. He believed in his father implicitly. And through hunger and loneliness, he would adapt. For he knew that was his fate. Rather than starve to death waiting for his father, Daigoro bravely decided to set out in search himself. He knew that each time his father finished an assassination, he offered prayers in front of the Buddha. He was a silent boy who shed no tears. - Wait! - Who are you? - Want some? - Strange kid! - You brat! - Ouch, ouch, ouch! - Let's teach him a lesson! - Wait! He didn't steal the watermelon. I was watching. He just happened to be here. - Enough. Let's go. - Where are you from? Are you alone? Better go on home. I'm in a hurry. Bye. TAKASHIMA MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE You mustn't follow me. Go on home. - Hey! What are you doing here? - What's going on? - This kid sneaked into the mansion. - He probably intended to steal something. - Tie him up. - I'll question him. - Yes. - Obstinate kid! He hasn't even uttered a cry. - Obviously, he's of low birth. That's why he's so rebellious. Now... still unafraid? Now...? - Hold it. - My lord, you are back. What is it? - Those eyes... Eyes that are accustomed to scenes of carnage. Eyes of an assassin. - Absurd! - I can't believe it either. But this child has no fear of swords. Suio "Horse-slaying" style. It could be the child of Lone Wolf. - Lone Wolf? - I received a missive from Inspector Yagyu Bizen-no-kami. The assassin known as Lone Wolf and Child is in the vicinity. - Lone Wolf and Child? - Former shogunate decapitator, Ogami Itto. We are to apprehend him the minute he is found. But he seems to be a formidable opponent. - What are we to do? - Don't panic! His child is in our hands. If his child's life is in danger, surely, Lone Wolf will come to his rescue. Just bide our time. - You must be hungry. - Yes. - Here... How could they be so cruel to a mere child? Where are your father and mother? Tell me, so I can notify them. I see... Me too. I'm an orphan. I don't know your name. - Daigoro. - I'm Sato. I'll bring you food again. I'm here, so don't cry. Okay? - Such an odd child. He shows no fear at all. He sheds no tears nor does he cry out for his father. And he's had no food or drink. - Speak! How are you connected to that boy?! - I'm not...! - I just felt sorry for him! - Don't act innocent! - Osato, tell me! Why did you come to work here? Confess! - I know nothing! - Make her talk, even if it kills her. - Sister... - You must run away, Daigoro-chan. - So they are siblings. - He distinctly called her "Sister." - Get away, Daigoro-chan! - Get him! - Wait! Just follow him closely. He's sure to run to his father. We couldn't have prayed for a better turn of events. - Go! TAKASHIMA MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE - Pa! Pa! - Lone Wolf and Child are here! - Get him! - I don't know the situation, but there seems to be no need for words. - Why you...! - Sister... - Daigoro-chan... - Pa... - I'm so glad you found him. - How far do you intend to follow us? - I cannot accept such money. Besides, I have no family. Please let me come. - I refuse. Go home to your village. You cannot travel with us. Besides... You've been trained in the martial arts. - Oh no... not at all. - Sister! YAGYU - YAGYU. - According to the Kurokawa agents, - According to the Kurokawa agents, Ogami Itto crossed the Nakasendo Highroad and is along here on the Tokaido Highroad. - I see. - Lone Wolf and Child are gaining notoriety. Rumor has it that Ogami is hoarding his assassination fees so that he may someday restore his house. - Ridiculous fool! As long as there is a Yagyu alive, the Ogami family will never be reinstated. - Father. - Brother. In time, I will destroy Ogami Itto. - Well said, Gunbei. - Avenge your brother Kurando. - Secretary Okuyama Sobei-sama is here to see you. - Show him in. - Yes, sir! - This message box arrived from Kishu this morning. - It's a midsummer greeting to the shogun. - Precisely. On the surface. But in actuality, it is a coded circular letter from Yagyu agents throughout the provinces. Gunbei, decipher it immediately. - Sir! It is I, Gunbei. - Enter. - 1 deciphered the circular. Our secret agents in Kishu are in danger of being exposed. - Nonsense! Send another secret circular. Order everyone to lay low for a while. - Sir. "- Hey, it's a shichiri!" The shichiri is coming! The shichiri is coming! The shichiri is coming! The shichiri is coming! OHAMA POST TOWN - 7 RI (1 RI = 2.44 miles) messengers were so-named because they traveled 7 RI (17 miles) at a time to deliver missives from clan lords to the shogunate. Men were chosen for their running and fencing ability. And they had a license to kill anyone who obstructed their way. Hence, commoners feared and avoided them like the plague. And the messenger carrying the Shogun's Crest was feared even more. - Move! - Wait! Look at this... It's the baby's spirit tablet... He died right after birth. Poor thing... He wasn't even named. Please, give him a name! He was your child! I won't let go! Damn! He was your flesh and blood! You'll pay for this! You devil! Your own wife's trying to hang herself, and you don't even look! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! SAKE I want someone to kill Jinza, the shichiri messenger to Kishu. How about you... the one with the mustache? - Are you crazy? You know what will happen if you kill a messenger? - I won't ask you to do it for free. You can have me in return. Do whatever you want with my body. Then sell me off to a whorehouse. You'll get 20 ryo at least. Come on! No takers? - Proprietor, we want to rent out this place. - But I still have customers. - Have them leave. Do I hear any complaints? - Absolutely not! - We're leaving right now. - We want you to leave, too. - I refuse. - What?! Don't act so high and mighty. Or you'll regret it. - Don't interfere with our dinner. - You wretch...! - You would take on Kishu samurai? - If animals attack, it's only natural to defend oneself. - You dare call us animals?! - Exactly. It's useless trying to reason with animals. Only animals would attack before sizing up their opponent, and bare their fangs without testing the other's power. Your head will be next! - We're wasting time here. - Let's go! - Little boy, you're so cute. I meant you. - Mama...? - What's the matter? - Forgive me. If he had lived, my son would be his age. I beg you! Please help me! - I was listening earlier. - But why? - I want to avenge my son who died right after birth. My son had no name, and I want him to find eternal peace. - Tell me your story. - The child's father was Jinza, a shichiri messenger. I'm his wife, Otoshi. Well, he divorced me right after the baby died, and now, I'm just a prostitute. His obsession with work ruined everything. Three days after birth, our son became ill. I ran after my husband who was on a route and asked him to get the doctor. The doctor lived so far away, I'd have taken all day. He'd have gotten there in barely three hours. And it was on his route too. But he didn't do anything. Sure, dedication to work is admirable. But this was different! His own son's life was at stake! And that night... our son died. - You're from... - Yes, we're from the Kishu clan. We want that message box. - What? - There are secret Yagyu messages inside. - I know nothing! My duty is to deliver this to the castle! - Damn you! - Dear...! Dearest...! - You bastard! - Withdraw! - Dearest... - Otoshi... Let me see him... Forgive me... - Jinkichi...? Dearest one Dearest one. - For him, each route was his battleground. Though he may have wanted to, it was not possible for him to come to your aid. He gave his life to his lord's service. How difficult it must have been for him. Show yourself! I know you're Yagyu men! The missive inside must be important indeed. I'll wager it's a secret circular for Yagyu agents. Isn't that right? That's all the more reason, you can't have it. If I decipher the Yagyu code, it will mean your destruction. - Damn you! - If you want it, fight for it! But be warned, I'm not ready to die yet. - What? - Itto has the message box?! - Sir... - Fools! Why did you not fight him for it? - Sir. Fighting would have been simple. I thought it more critical to notify you immediately. - Failure means death. - Yes, sir. - He may have the circular and know there is a secret message, but the Yagyu code is not that simple to break. But, our very existence is at stake. Bizen, get it back! - Yes, sir. - Ogami Itto... You will see how formidable I can be! - What measures will you take? - A special female agent has already been sent. Bury this man properly. Yes, sir! - Late! - They're late...! What are the Kurokawa agents doing?! - I'am here, sir. - Then you must have heard. Get every one of the Kurokawa group on this. - One moment, please. Unlike the Yagyu, the Kurokawa harbor no grudge against Ogami Itto. - What? - Besides, we are spies for the shogunate. The killing of men are done by your Yagyu assassins. - Insolence! Defy us and you will suffer the same fate as Ogami Itto! - No! - Silence, Sayomaru! - But, brother...! - If you understand, find Itto and just get the message box back. We will do the killing ourselves. - Is there a smithy nearby? - Yes, sir. - Straight down here to the left. GUNSMITH KUNITOMO-YA - The axle is broken. - Can you fix it? - Our family earned some fame as gunsmiths, so tell me why I should fix an old piece of junk like this? - Don't say that. Look, I want some modifications made in addition. I'll pay you well. - Sister...! - Daigoro-chan...! - Osato! Where do you think you're going? We own you now! You're not free to do as you please. - I can't figure it out. I can't find any clues to break the code. Daigoro, we've challenged the Yagyu to come after us now. We're standing at the edge of death. You're. - Please save me! - You didn't go back to your village? - I'm sorry, but I wanted to see Daigoro again. But I was tricked by some bad men. - There's blood on your face. - Pardon us! We're looking for a woman who seriously injured a man. - She's not here. - Let us check anyway. - And if ll won't allow it? - Are you interfering with official business?! - I paid a high price for this room and some privacy. To me, this is my castle. If you're going to search, be prepared to pay dearly. - What if we find her? - Anyone who helps a convict gets the same sentence. - That is correct. - Now we'll take a look. And if she's not here, you can have my neck. This is... - I was disciplining my son. Now you owe me your life. - Please...! - Let's go! Sir. - Come out. - Thank you! - Go now. - Escape through the back. This time, go back to your village. Each person has his own destiny. Understand, Daigoro? We have our journey to make. And she must walk her own path. It is sad, but this is one thing we cannot control. - There she is! Bitch! - Come with us, Osato. - Hold it! The ronin is a guest of the inn. Don't bother him. Yes. - I'm the boss of this territory. - My name is Kioroshi no Torizo. That woman is one of my whores, who hurt my man Monku Matsu and escaped. Please hand her over. - I refuse. - What...?! - People call us yakuza, the scum of society. So it's useless defying our kind. You can't win, so please stay out of it. - Osato, you're a whore now. - We own you... so come! - You're stubborn, aren't you? If you don't listen, you'll force us to kill this samurai and the boy, too. It's part of the underworld code not to bother decent folks. - Osato, come over here! - You refuse to turn her over? - Correct. - I've tried explaining things to you, but you're not very smart, are you? It's silly to risk the lives of you and your son for her. - You yakuza live on the outskirts of society, my son and I walk through purgatory. We'll be the ones to save this girl. - Talking so big! - Show him! - Hold it! - He'll kill all of you first. - But we started... - Leave it to me. - Think you can win? I'll thrust the same time you shoot. I'll probably be shot, but at this distance, your death is a certainty. - That's not a pleasant thought. Samurai-San, I don't care if you're at Hades' gate, but I can't afford to lose face. Let's make a deal. I promise that as soon as Osato is punished, she'll be free to go. - Agreed. But mete out your punishment on me instead. I've heard that fellow prostitutes are allowed to stand-in for a sick friend. - What if we beat you to death, samurai-San? - I'm prepared. - Then let us show you the way. Well, boss? Shall we continue the 'buri-buri' torture? - No, that's enough. There aren't many true samurai left in the world. He's one of them. I've destroyed her contract. - Very good. Such beautiful dolls. - Prostitute dolls. - Prostitute dolls? - They protect my girls. Samurai-San, may I ask you a question? - Yes. - You said you live at Hades' gate. Are you perhaps...? - The assassin, Lone Wolf and Child. - Am I your target? If so, I'll take you on. - Watch closely! A prostitute who had spent half her life in these quarters then was kicked out because she became too sick begged me in her dying breath, to destroy the prostitute goddesses. The locks are from prostitutes who died, and their kimono, too, come from those who died. She said their bitterness was so great, none could find peace. Let me ask you something, too. - What is it? - 1 think your heart is gentle. You put on a tough act as the boss. But you, yourself, were sold here, weren't you? Farewell. - The assassin, Lone Wolf and Child. - Hey! The boat is leaving! - You're giving me this dog? Thank you. Daigoro-chan, I'll take good, good care of him. Good bye! - Sister...! - Sayonara! - Sister! - Take care! - Sayonara! - Who are you? - Kurokawa's Yashamaru. - Are the Kurokawa now taking orders from the Yagyu? - If you hand over the message box, 1 won't need to kill you. - Retsudo must be in a fit over the box. Knowing that, I can't let you have it. - It cannot be helped. The Kurokawa chain! - The battle sword! You underrated the cutting edge of my sword. Is anything amiss? - Well... I had my spasms again. But I'm better now. Please don't worry. - I'm relieved. - Excuse me. Mr. Samurai, aren't you the one called Lone Wolf? The assassin, Lone Wolf and Child? - That's right. - What good fortune! I have been searching for you for a long time. - You don't mean to hire me as an assassin, do you? - No... but the princess. - Princess? - Old one, I found Lone Wolf and Child. - The Princess is waiting! - Please, come inside. - Be a good boy and wait here. And, Honored Wolf, please hand over your weapon. We must not frighten the princess. Thank you. Princess, I am sorry to have kept you waiting. It is time to get ready. - I am Princess Sayo. - Assassin, Lone Wolf and Child. - I would like you to eliminate one person. - I need to know the reason. And my fee is... - I've heard that 500 ryo would suffice. - Old one... - Yes. - This is one of our family treasures. It should bring at least 2,000 ryo. - And my target? - Lone Wolf and Child, formerly known as Ogami Itto. - What? - I am Sayomaru of the Kurokawa! - Prepare. - And Mushimaru of the same! - Killing me now will only benefit the Yagyu. - Silence! We never desired to become Yagyu pawns. But you killed my brother, Yashamaru, and 4 others. We can't let their deaths go unavenged! - Pa! - Impressive... Ogami Itto... As the last of the Kurokawa, I tell you this... The Yagyu... are out to... destroy you... by any means. The shogunate... has received reports... about you. - I expected that. - So... the only path... - open to you now is to... decipher the Yagyu message... and uncover their plot. Open the shogun's eyes... and challenge the Yagyu... out in the open. - Decipher? - Go to... the silk province... - Silk province? Is this the silk province? - That's what it's long been called. - I want to speak to one of your elders. - See that house? The oldest man in the village lives there. - Any ideas? Fire, water, acid and other methods have failed. The only solid clue I have is the dead man's final utterance, "Silk province." What is it? - This paper smells of mulberry. I'm sure of it. - So? What's this...?! - They wrote the secret message with mulberry juice. - And the silkworms ate through the message! So this is the Yagyu conspiracy. A plot that would shake the very foundations of government! Daigoro, we head for Edo! I hold the Yagyu secret in my hand, Retsudo. This time, I will get vengeance without fail! - Arrest warrants for Lone Wolf and Child, Ogami Itto and his son had reached every daimyo lord and shogunate official. Furthermore, the entire Yagyu clan army lay in wait. Chances seemed slim indeed for Itto and his son. However, there was no choice but to advance to Edo. - Lone Wolf and Child! - Submit! - Calm down! I do not wish to take innocent lives. But provocation may force me to kill. - Arrest them! - Yes, sir! - Unreasonable men! If you wish to die so badly, I will send you to hell! Daigoro! - Lord Sado-no-kami Masatsune, why the hesitation? Lone Wolf and Child will enter your fief tomorrow. Gather your men and capture him. And if you are able, kill him! - If I wish to refuse? - What?! You would defy the government for a mere ronin and his son? Would you have your house abolished, with you ordered to commit seppuku and your vassals sent homeless in the streets? - Ogami Itto-dono was my swordsmanship instructor. - Masatsune-dono. You cannot master the Suio style like that. - Pa. - Ogami Itto. - Lord Masatsune. - I am under orders to forbid your passage! - And yet, I must pass. - Then you force my hand. I shall be assisted by five of my top vassals. - Agreed. - You will be accorded the full etiquette of battle. That is the least respect I can show my former teacher. - 1 do not deserve such consideration. - Men, fight bravely and fairly. And do not harm the child! - I appreciate your concern. But my son and I walk the path of Hades together. No compassion is necessary. - Formations! Attack! Ogami Itto. Prepare yourself! - Such speed and precision. You have mastered the secret of the Suio style. Had we fought in water, you would have prevailed. I am most impressed. - My thanks... Farewell. FUKUSHIMA POST TOWN DAIMYO'S INN TROOP HQ TROOP HQ - So Lord Masatsune has failed, too. - Yes. We must call up the armies of Wino, Ogaki and Toda. - We cannot rely on daimyo lords! We, the Ura-Yagyu, must do it ourselves! - Sir. If Ogami bypasses the castle towns and checkpoints, he is sure to pass through Hell's Valley. This is where we shall confront him. - This lawless assassin must be killed. For the good of society, his journey through purgatory with his son must be stopped! - Exactly! - We Yagyu have justice on our side. Ogami Itto, we will settle our feud once and for all! - Ogami Itto, we have been waiting for you! You die here! - Daigoro! - Fire! - Damn you! Itto, there's no escape! Resign yourself and hand over the message box! - I'll use the circular that was inside to destroy the Ura-Yagyu! - Kill him! - Daigoro, ready? - Itto, you made a fine getaway. - Retsudo! - But this is as far as you'll get. By now, your Dotanuki sword must be dull and useless. - I have seen the Yagyu circular! - You haven't deciphered the message though. - It was simple. If the shogunate should learn of your plot to control government through the message system, it will mean your destruction. Well, Retsudo? - Perhaps so... Thus I must regain the secret circular from you. Get him! Don't chase him! - Retsudo-sama...! - You are my enemy, it's true, but your skill befits your former rank! - Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! - Wa... water... - Pa! - It's nice to see you again. - Kioroshi no Torizo? - I'm on my way home after settling some trouble. I'd like to help. You're headed for Edo, aren't you? - Exactly. - But if you keep going, many innocent people will die. You don't want that, do you? And it looks like you've been wounded, too. Let us escort you to Edo. I already have a plan. - You've made me an offer I can't refuse. It's a debt I won't be able to repay in this world. - Then, let's go. - Boss, this cart is too conspicuous. - I realize that. CHECKPOINT WANTED POSTER LONE WOLF AND CHILD - I am Torizo of the Kioroshi gang. My men and I are on our way home. Please allow us to pass. - Who's the boy? - My adopted son and heir. - His age and his looks are very similar. - To what? - To the son of the wanted criminal, Lone Wolf and Child. - You must be kidding! - He really is my son. - All right. I get it. You can pass. - Thank you. Let's go. - Wait! Did someone drop this? - It's mine. Thank you. - Daigoro! - What's wrong? - Many thanks, but we'll part here. - There are many more checkpoints until Edo. - If we keep traveling together, you'll be wanted as accomplices. - This is no time to think about that! - The situation has changed. - They're coming after us. They've probably just gathered their men at the station. - You mean they saw through our ruse? - Forget us and go. - Iwa, you didn't...! You dropped your tobacco pouch on purpose and left a note...? - Yes, I turned him in. I left a note saying that Lone Wolf and Child held us hostage and forced us to travel together. - Iwa! - Boss! It's useless helping a wanted criminal like him! We'll all end up dead! I'll gladly give my life if you'll wash your hands of him. Go ahead, kill me since I betrayed you. But in return, don't involve our gang in your troubles! - Iwa, you...! - He's right. Let us part here. - Sir... - Farewell, Torizo. - I've spent 26 years of my life as a man. Iwa... - Yes? I appoint you Torizo Ill. Take care of the gang. - Boss... - When I die, at least, I want to die a woman. - Boss...!! She's going to him! - Torizo! - Sir, let me die with you! - Withdraw! - Torizo! Torizo, hang on! Torizo! - Call me... Otori. - Otori! - I'm so happy... Being able... to die... in your arms. - Otori... Daigoro, do you know what this flower is called? This is... - It was azami... a thistle. Azami, the name of Daigoro's mother. Azami, Itto's wife. Azami, which in flower language, meant vengeance. Vengeance, the single thought which guided this man and son. - Excellency, your authority shines bright spanning over 60 fiefs. You have a truly peaceful reign indeed. - 1 do not believe that. I have heard the angry wolf's cry. I understand three clans and five fiefs have felt its fangs. - I am very sorry to hear that. - Ogami Itto has tarnished your reputation and belittled the Tokugawa's prestige. - You are right. - But I am hearing more and more criticism of the Yagyu. Forget personal grudges and do not misuse power. - Heed my words, Retsudo. - Sir! - The Yagyu exist because the Tokugawa exist. - Yes, the Yagyu exist because the Tokugawa exist. But also... the Tokugawa owe their very existence to the Yagyu. - Father, here you are. - Looking at it with one eye, the moon seems closer. The injured eye throbs... Itto's face flickers in and out of my mind. He has reached Edo. - He can't have overcome all those men? - Ogami Itto is no longer a mere mortal. - He is a driven demon at the gate of Hades. - We'll find him and throw every Yagyu we have at him. - Bizen! I, Retsudo, will take on Ogami Itto in single combat. - But Father...! - It will be demon against demon! - I am former shogunate decapitator, Ogami Itto. I once lived in this house. - My master is out at the moment. If you will return after sundown. - Let me ask one question. There used to be a prayer room and memorial tablets. Do you know if they are still intact? - Yes, sir. - If any are still here, I want to offer prayers. - When my master moved in, he read sutras for them all and then burned them. - 1 understand. - I shall take my leave then. - Yes, sir. - Just a moment, please! I am Fujino, wife of Tsuchiya Hyogo. Ogami-sama, please come in. - Thank you. - Dear... Daigoro... Take care of him. - Ogami-sama. This was entrusted to my husband by Yagyu Retsudo-sama. Yagyu-sama said you would be sure to stop here. He asked that we give it to you. - "Letter of Challenge" "} duly challenge you to a duel upon your arrival in Edo." “I shall wait for you for three days beginning “the 10th day of this month, Ogami Itto-dono. "Yagyu Retsudo." - Retsudo. - I've waited for you, Itto! I see you're dressed to die. - Retsudo. How many must die before you are satisfied? - Silence! You will not face me until all these others fall. - Daigoro, do not move from here. - Stand back! Itto... Prepare! - I've waited for this moment! - 1 will get the Yagyu circular after I kill you. Come. - Daigoro! - Go to him! - Hurry! - Excuse me. - Father! - We got him! - Bizen. - Yes. - As of this moment, you are disinherited! - Father...? - Our duel just now was not out of personal hatred. It was a duel between two samurai warriors! - Father! - Fool! - Father... - Daigoro! Anyone home?! - Welcome home! Who is that child...? - Call Dr. Rokusai! - Yes. - Hurry! - Here, pup. - You call yourself my granddaughter? - Forgive me! - Come here! - Grandfather, please forgive me! Grandfather... - Take it! - Sato, take the practice sword! - Pardon! - With that skill, why did you not kill Itto?! Did you grow to love that child? You fool! - Grandfather... - I shall atone with my life. - You are a Yagyu. Die bravely. - Daigoro-chan... - Daigoro, you wish to kill me in your father's stead? Pitiful child. But you must wait. It is true that your father and I are bitter enemies, but when our swords were drawn, the true samurai spirit moved us. Do you understand? When we meet next, we will again meet as samurai, as warriors. True samurai warriors! Daigoro... come to me. You and your father are destined to travel through purgatory together. Mark my words. If your father dies, you will die. If I die, the Ura-Yagyu will die. He's fallen asleep. - Look. - "To Yagyu Retsudo." “I will face you once more on this day at 12:30 pm. "Ogami Itto." - I've been waiting! - Pa! Pa! - Thank you for taking care of Daigoro. - I owe you too. For letting my granddaughter go knowing, all the while, that she was an assassin. - Here is the Yagyu circular. I intended to submit it to the shogun. But I have no use for it anymore. - Why? - Our rivalry grew out of personal hatred. But on this journey through purgatory, I have wasted too many lives. There should be no more of that. - You no longer desire that your post as decapitator be restored with the House of Ogami? - That is correct. - 1, too, no longer covet power for the Ura-Yagyu. This duel is not a personal vendetta anymore. We seek to preserve the samurai code. - The floating boat stance? - He's going on the offensive? - It was a fight to the death. These two... no, these three, were no longer mortals. The wind... they became the wind. Unceasing and resilient like the wind. Light and smooth as the spring breeze at times. Then hard and brutal like a typhoon. Changing constantly. Daigoro became one with his father. It was his battle too. And through it all Daigoro endured. Edo did not sleep that night. There was not a soul who was unaware of this great duel on the Haccho's banks. The town magistrate and his men stood ready to move. Direct vassals, daimyo lords and their men stood ready too. Even the shogun knew. High ranking officials remained on duty. Those allied with the Yagyu. Those sympathetic to Ogami. All of Edo waited with bated breath. - Excellency, what is the matter? - I am going to the Haccho riverbanks. - You must not! Your presence will raise a personal battle into a serious shogunate matter! - Enough! This is a duel of honor! The way of the samurai is at stake here. And as the leader of all samurai, I must witness it. Depart! Yes, sir! - Thus, the shogun himself acted. Direct vassals, daimyo lords, and their men also hurried to the Haccho River. With the shogun in front, the rest lined up solemnly in precision formation. This attention was the highest form of respect that could be paid to the duelists. The resolve of Ogami and Retsudo commanded admiration. All opinion flew to the wind, all eyes transfixed on the two men. - I have but one request. Show me your secret underwater technique. - As you wish. - Magnificent! Ogami Itto... heed my final request. I know that enmity has existed between us. But you are the former shogunate decapitator. I ask that you deliver the finishing blow... - Decapitator. I accept. - Daigoro... be a dutiful son. Fare thee well. - At the end of this grueling battle, reverent respect filled the air. For Itto, Retsudo, and Daigoro. And to those who witnessed the match, it was a victory for all samurai... No, a victory for all mankind. For they learned a profound lesson in the meaning of life, adversity, and death. Cast.
