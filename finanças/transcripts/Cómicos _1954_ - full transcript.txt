Tomorrow another train as we have to go to Palencia... Two days. And three to Logro?o. To Badajoz and Lugo... One week in Zaragoza. One month in Barcelona. And Madrid, four months. The entire company sleeps... or at least they try. The bosses don't travel with them. They travel by road. They have a car. Sleep is a must. These trips... A single minute of work cannot be lost. One day's salary, neither. Traveling means no eating. Rafael Mu?oz, is the character actor, the beard. Almost certainly he's been hanging out with Mar?a Guerrero, with "la Pino". Surely he's toured America, and maybe had his own company. Rafael Mu?oz, salary 30 duros. Had his opportunity and, nevertheless, he still waits. Matilde Agustin, Rafael's wife. All-round actress. She would prefer to have stayed home. Be with her kids... Matilde Agustin... 18 duros. Jose Luis Suarez, leading man. 35 duros. Has his own plans. Looking for a partner. Not for marrying, but to establish a company. With a bit of luck... maybe cinema... Miguel Solis. Second lead. 25 duros. Just joined the company this very night, halfway. It's an opportunity. Hasn't worked for a long time. Constantino Valdes. 20 duros. Not an actor, but shares their luck. An agent. He checks the luggage, buys the tickets, has the contracts... On Monday he pays the wages and discounts the advances. Pepito. He has no salary. Unpaid trainee. Performs nonspeaking or servant roles, and helps don Antonio dressing too, the actor-manager. That's his duty for 6 months. It's mandatory. Then... Antonia Ramos. 35 duros. Character actress In the comedies she's usually the mother of the lead. She knows everything: what is done and what is said, and what is going to be done and to be said. Marga. Margarita Hernandez. 40 duros. She's the second actress, i.e., the bad woman in the plays. The other one, the lover of the lead. One must dress well, be tall, beautiful, attractive to get that role. Marga was destined for it. And I... Ana. Ana Ruiz. 20 duros. 5 years of theatre, and I play small roles of 20 lines. In the pink comedies I'm the ingenue and the lead falls in love with me. Just small roles. But I wait... Someday I will have an opportunity. And they will know who I am. Yes. Everyone will see that I am an actress. A good one. A comedienne. A good one. I wait. I wait. I wait... No, Solis, no. Not that way. It's impossible. What happened? - Really, do?a Carmen, I... But how is it possible to make an exit... Don't go away, Ana. This interests you. You're there with Ana. She gives me a cue and I say my line. Why pounce on me? Why? But, Carmen... - Shut up, don't try to be right. Tell me how can I say my line if he pounces on me, and catches my arms? That's just killing the final effect. - How could I know? The stage direction is quite clear. Robert pounces on Eloisa and grabs her arms furiously. Furiously? Fine, but not so much. And besides, that's what the author says. And what does he know? It's impossible to finish this way. - Well, that's another thing. If they do it another way I wouldn't know. I've just arrived. The stage direction says furiously. How could I know...? - Really, Solis, It's just common sense. Alright. It's nobody's fault. Tomorrow we'll fix it, it doesn't matter. Let's go. See you later. - How can it not matter? See you later. - See you later. Nice debut. - Don't listen to him. He'd take out your eyes as soon as he figures you'll take to the stage. Tomorrow... - Yes, tomorrow a rehearsal for me. What joy. Goodbye. I'll sleep until lunchtime. 12 hours today on public transport. Do you have a room yet? - I Hope so. Valdes told me that he knows a nice one. And you? Apart from being far away, not very clean and not much to eat, it's nice. Always so optimistic... Welcome, Miguel. I'm glad we're together again. Me too. We've a lot to talk about. I remember too much about... Oh, sorry. There goes my man. We'll talk later. Yes, we'll talk later. - See you. Valdes. Valdes! What about me? - No place. What? - There's no place. What a mess. What can I do? - You've two solutions... The first is the Hotel Excelsior where do?a Carmen is. With a month's advance. - It's up to you. And the other... Don't. I can imagine. - Don't worry, love. Marga can fix it for sure. See you later. - Hopefully. See you later. Listen, Valdes, do you know the timetable yet? - Yes... 7:11 "When the stars shine". 7:15 rehearsal of first act of "When Etcetera etcetera" for Mrs. Soler, Mr. Salas, Miss Ruiz and Mr. Solis. - Me too? That's what it says here. This is called being lucky. Now it turns out, tomorrow I've a rehearsal at quarter past. Just when I'd planned to wake up. But honestly, where will I get up if I've nowhere to sleep? No. Had a place, but it fell through. Come with me, then. - Oh, you aim too high But anyway, what a choice... We'll ask Valdes for money. Are you sure there's enough room for me? For sure. My room has two beds. You don't know this wonderful city? - No. I've never been. Find it strange? - Why? Only liver patients or actors come here. Almost the same. - You think so? You'll see. You're starting out. You still don't have enough repertoire. And how is it? - The city? It has two theatres: One bad and one good. We're in the good one. Two reputable cafes one new and one old. Actors go to the old one. A good hotel and some bad lodging houses. Actors go to any of them. And that's all. Are you coming to dinner? - No. We'll have dinner here. I'm really tired. - And me. My feet hurt... Well, see you later. Nice lad, don't you think? What a choice... He's not very handsome, not very smart, not really anything... What else can he be? You're bitter tonight. - I'm so sleepy I could bite. You like Miguel Solis? - How? - To us, men, including Nobel prize winners, can only be liked for being like that, like men. Then I like him. He's not bad as an actor, he's smart... Smarter than an actor. You're not interested. It's okay, grandma. Let's suppose you're right. I just said that I like him, I like Gregory Peck too. Me too. But I'm not right for him. What do you mean? - This. I said I like Miguel Solis and look at all the fuss you've made. I didn't say I love him. I couldn't. No? - No. Not for now. We started in the theatre at the same time. Were together an entire season. And coincidentally came together again, you know... a company that goes, another that comes... Until now. Today he debuted with us. I'm glad. And why did he debut with us? - Why ask that? Yes, it's very simple. He could have gone with Emilia Varga. I don't think that he'll earn more here. Neither money nor glory. If Ana Ruiz wasn't in the company... would he have come too? I'll say no more. I don't like hitting someone when they're down. Everything will collapse, the filthy masks will fall, falsehood and vice. - Roberto... Don't be cruel. Forget those crazy loves. It's necessary to have adventure and happiness in our home. Roberto... - Shut up, leave me now. Finally I'll speak clearly in this house. At last my voice will be heard. between shady pasts and fatherly swords. You never listen. Never! In this house, Because you're a bastard! Miguel. - What? Now you approach her quickly. - Quickly? It's that... Well, it's true. Is this the little table or the couch? The couch, I think. - That's the couch. Well, you approach her quickly as if rushing to her. Naturally, the couch stops you. You stay a moment like... - Demoralized. Demoralized! That's it. Then Carmen speaks. You approach her slowly and with her final line you fall on your knees. And I say... - And you say that... What do you say? Sorry, no, no, no, no. - Well, that, that... Carmen. - I'm coming. What do I say? - That's why you'll never... That's why you'll never raise your voice in this house, because you're a bastard! A bastard! A bastard! No, Andres, you don't want me to silence the voice of blood and to prevent that our love could... Love, love, and loneliness, I don't know what. When the stars shine. - Sorry, sorry, no, no, no, no. Well, very good. Very well. I think it's clear, right? Yes I think so. - Anything more, Don Antonio? - No, nothing more. Want to "spend something", Carmen? - No, nothing. Bye to all. Are you coming, Antonio? - Yeah, let's go. See you later. What time is it? - 17:20. Fancy a bite to eat? What are you looking for? - A cathedral, maybe there's a cathedral. Maybe a river. It's curious. What is? - That my trunk is broken from traveling so much and I only know one theatre, one cafe and one lodging house. That's better. At least you can believe things are as one imagines them. You see? Here is a square with a colonnade. Boys and girls walk from seven to nine and become a couple going around. Yes. And beyond there's a park and a music kiosk, and the statue of a man in a frock coat. - Who paid for all the drains. On the right is the cathedral and passing the river the seminary. Sounds strange. The river is on the left, next to the bullring. Well, there are two rivers. Now I'm remembering you. About you and me four years ago. Repertory Company of Carlos Arroyo At 18:30 and 22:30 "The lost treasure". Third guest star: Ana Ruiz. Co-third guest star: Miguel Solis. In the first act we just took up space. In the second we didn't do anything. And I, in the third, had to say: 'How? Extraordinary! Bravo!' And I: "What? Impossible! Viva!" After all this time... What's your evaluation? 4 years ago, when I didn't know anything, I thought I was a great actress. 3 years ago that I was good, 2 years ago I hoped to become one. And now... Now I fear being just one more. Yes, Miguel... I'm starting to be tired, starting to be tired of being alone. Of the rehearsals, two daily performances, of the travelling and lodging houses. Of the 20 line roles, of the advances, of colleagues and... Well... getting tired of waiting... I can't allow you to think that. Look. Troupers! There you have them. Of all ages. With 40 years of theatre like Gonzalez or 40 days like this boy. Many have already had their opportunity. Marga, for example. Others not yet. You'll tell me that they all wait. That dubiously they trust in an impossible triumph. Maybe they are full of hope. They carefully keep all their reviews. And at any time they can exhibit a success they had in Cuenca 15 years ago. For me they are sometimes pathetic... And always endearing. Just look. So different from each other and all with something in common. Something they don't even know... Love for the theatre. For the theatre... You're too naive, Miguel. The theatre for them, and also for me, I'm afraid, is a big thing with seats. - Don't be so foolish. I'm not, Miguel. That boy, the trainee, maybe lives for the theatre. Me too. I also did 4 years ago. And you, no longer. We simply live from theatre. Others lay the foundations. You don't believe me? Why don't you go? Why not leave it then? I have to eat. - Work on something else. I only do this. - Marry. - With whom? Me. That's it. Marry me and we'll both leave the theatre, okay? I still have to eat. And you, I suppose. - So? You already know I have other means. Okay now? No. I'm not kidding. You see? You'll never leave the theatre. Not them either. Not even if you win the lottery. Then least of all. You'd form a colossal company. None of you can leave. If you think it's too corny to say "love of the theatre", call it what you like: poison, vocation... The result is the same. You won't leave. I think you're right. Look at that. On stage in half an hour. Come on, Matilde. - I'm coming, man, I'm coming. - Where the hell you were? - Closing the trunks. As if there wasn't time later. - Later's a drag. Well, it's not you. There's all the time in the world! What time do we take the train? - Who knows. Valdes will probably choose 4 in the morning. It's quite outrageous. - Will you please be quiet! I'm not a well woman. Careful. My nose is the one puffing up. - My dear Marquise. Oh! My dear Marquise! What a lovely party. Precisely I was telling Marcela... You know Marcela? - How could I not... It's been a while since we two... have something in common. - Quite right. Although I personally hope this thing in common will more than... How shall I say? Will be more abundant each day. Dear Alejandro. Where do you leave the snows of yesteryear? Marcela. - And you, Maria Jesus, Every day more insultingly beautiful - Please, Marcela... Look, I'll introduce you to Jorge. Jorge del Val. The man I want to marry. Marcela Santa Fe, the woman I want to imitate. - Dear Maria Jesus... You'll let me steal your page-boy. Have you packed the trunks? - No, I have to organize them. Anyone bored with this comedy? You'll see at 4:00 how much fun you'll have. Know what play we debut with? - "Honor of the sons". - I don't think so. Mu?oz told me that we're playing "When the stars shine". Impossible, la Vargas has already done it there. Valdes will tell me. I must see him. Money? - Money. This week I'm up to here. What do you do with your wages? - Don't know, just spend it. Sure, spend it for no reason. Then go to Valdes and everything is fixed. I think I can ask for my own money. - Yours? How is it yours? Not until Monday, so wait. - You're hateful. I can't wait. You think I like asking for it? - Why do you want it? None of your business. - No. But I must justify the bills to don Antonio. I don't have to explain it to you. - There's no loan then. I'll ask Don Antonio. - Ask him. Quarrel? - He's rude. He wants to know everything. Never. No way. But you got the advance? - No. I'll ask Don Antonio. Well, listen... If you want I could... - Don't even think of it, thanks. I'm too lazy to open mine. - Sure, later we'll pack them. Still not come off? - Want something? I want to talk to don Antonio. - I'll tell him. Good. Leave it to me, you'll see. Alejandro is unique in mixing liquids, ideas or colors. My dear, it's the demands of one's time. Today it's easier to find good bartenders than good soldiers. That's true, Lieutenant. Nothing else, thank you. Personally I prefer a man who makes me a good cocktail to one who can shoot me. He says if it's an emergency, wait for him in his room. - Thanks, Pepito. Anything for you. Oh, sorry. I didn't know... Please, come in. Don Antonio told me to wait for him here. - Fine. Take a seat. I know who you are. You first. - Thank you. I was going to say I know who you are. Blasco. Ernesto Sanchez Blasco. You've got it. - I saw your portrait in the papers when they took it. The Fems prize. - Congratulations. - Thanks. You know my play? - No. It's been a year since I was in Madrid. How is it? Madrid, my play or me? Well, all of them. - All wonderful. And you, Ana? - You know me? - I also know you. Seems strange? I'm a theatre goer since I was a little. You're not saying I'm that old? - Maybe. Ana Ruiz... I can't forget that Antigone you did in the rehearsal theatre. You like it? - You were extraordinary I wrote an article about you in "Mascara". - Really? I never read it. Not surprising. That number didn't come out. The magazine folded. And now what are you doing? - Waiting. You know about that, don't you? - For sure. It's been four years... Hello. Here we are. Look, Ernesto, I'll introduce you. No need, we're old friends. Does Ana know we'll premiere a work of yours? Really? - And you know it? These guys. I tell them I'll premiere the play, ask if he can make changes and instead of telegramming "yes" he comes from Madrid to say "no". Ignore him. He knows he's not right. Shut up... Why not go to the dressing room? We'll talk tonight while traveling. You driving and talking? Certain death. Goodbye, Ana. A pleasure. Indeed, Ernesto. A fine boy. Is it true? - About the play? It's here. - How is it? - For me it's extraordinary... If you think so... you'll see. What? It's too early to say anything, but if you're a nice girl... Maybe you'll have a surprise. - I'll be a nice girl. You said something about a very important thing. After that news I shouldn't say anything. I asked Valdes for an advance and he refused. A big one? - No, two weeks. Enough to survive til Monday. - And on Monday? Yes, I know. On Monday I'll take just a little and in the middle of the week I'll ask till the following Monday. I'm sorry, but I'm broke. - I'm sorry too. Business isn't going too well. You know I can't give you any more. - I haven't asked for an increase. After all, for what I do... - Aren't you happy with your work? Is it possible? - No. I didn't think so. Ana, you already know I trust you. I know you will triumph. You are too good an actress to go unnoticed. All that is really nice. Thank you... I'm a good actress... And for what? Who knows it? They'll know. Just wait. - Wait, wait... Always the same. I'll grow old waiting, Trust me. You'll see. Life isn't easy here. No, don't say. The wages are poor. One must make elegant costumes for idiotic comedies, one must turn to the old ones. One must eat. And above all... one must wait. - Yes. I don't think it's anything original. - Not at all. I work in the theatre too, didn't you know? Well, Ana. Tell Valdes to give you what you ask for. No buts. Don't worry. Tell him I said so. All right, don Antonio. Thank you. - It's nothing. Don Antonio, and my surprise? - Patience... Tell me at least what letter it starts with. - Wait, Ana. Wait. Don Antonio. - Whenever you want. I'm ready... Well, let's go with our colleagues to the canteen. Again? We never leave the cafe. - Well, then to the waiting room. Waiting rooms make me sad. - For sure... You're such a sentimentalist. Come one, let's go for a walk. - Yes, long live pneumonia. Don't exaggerate... It's only three degrees below zero. Besides that, you should breathe some fresh air. Look. That's the pole star and Ursa Major. When I was little I knew so many stars' names. - Me too... Greta Garbo, Marlene... It's a pretty bad one, huh? - What do you want? At three below. Well, why don't you say it? Say what? No one takes a girl out for a walk at dawn and at three below zero to talk about Ursa Major. Don't be impatient, girl. I'm looking for a situation like this in some good comedy. Very good. We can do the second act scene from "Elena's Sin". - I don't think I should, I prefer the third act of "Always you". Also, to say "I love you" at this point embarrasses me. Every actor already know it. Did you give a lecture? - Worse. I've written your name backstage of all Spain's theatres. One shouldn't write on walls. Also, it's useless. You have only to tell me. Well... I love you. I love you too, Miguel. And that's enough for you? - What do you mean? "I love you, Ana. I love you, Miguel". And all solved. I never said so. - As you wish. But we can try to solve it together. Agreed. What are you thinking about? Oh, Miguel, don't be unbearable. I know what it is! I can't only think of continuing. - How? Explain yourself. As usual. - As usual? Really? Oh, Miguel, don't torment me. It's hard. Really hard. I believe it's impossible. Well, suppose I know that. What does it have to do with our love? - Oh, that's funny... It's difficult just because we love each other, if not... If not, what? You know very well. You are the only thing that keeps me here... in the theatre. You want to throw it away? You give up so easily? Yes. You still have hope. I don't anymore. Don't you want to fight? - I don't know how. I never knew. Miguel... - You'll say I'm a pessimist, right? Aren't you? - Maybe. Of course I don't see a cheerful future. At least for me. And for me, yes? Yes. for you. Why? - I don't know. I can't tell you exactly why. It's just a feeling. Do you think I can succeed? - Yes. I think so. I could also be wrong. And regarding you? - What? Could you be wrong? - No... I know very well I'll never become famous. I'll always fall between two stools. Just another actor. And I don't want that. Caesar or nothing. If you can do great things, then yes, you stay here. You always want to be Hamlet, Don Juan, the protagonist. You can't play the smallest role. The one who doesn't speak at all. That's possible. - And so it is... You're not an actor. - Well... You'll give me a whole lecture about the humility of the actor. No, don't worry, I don't know much about this. So? I keep on it, simply I keep on it and wait. I... I give up. I'll return home. Don't you want to wait until Madrid? - For what? What's there? - There'll always be more opportunities than in your home town. Speak for yourself. You trust that comedy. - Yes. Don Antonio told me... - He told you very little. That's enough for me! You'll see. I'll go back home. Anyway, It's on our way to Madrid. Our? Yes. I want you to come with me... And get married. No, Miguel. - I know... You prefer this. I don't love you less for that. - Perhaps... But you love this more. - Miguel, it's different. How could I explain it? - You don't have to. And I wasn't going to understand it either. Maybe that explains everything... Explains what? - That... Do you hear it? Where are you going? - To see don Antonio. Now I don't need a ticket to Madrid. Miguel, couldn't we...? - No. Come on, don't waste time. You start in half an hour. Yes, I'm going right away. It was some time ago. What were you saying? That on Sundays I usually fish for trout. Ah... then there's a river. Yes. And a cathedral... - And a bullring. And the statue of a man in a frock coat... - And a music kiosk... We're almost there, right? - Yes, just by crossing the bridge. What will you do? - When? Now, when you arrive. - Sleep. Sleep until lunchtime. My mother cooks very well, but Jacinta does it better. Jacinta? Yes, she's from the town where our farm is. What will your mother say? Figure it... Cry. And Jacinta too. Maybe more. I was the black sheep of the family. - Don't they like the theatre? The theatre itself, yes. Actors... you know. Yes, in the past they weren't buried in sacred ground. The bridge. Yes... Come on... Don't be so childish. Haven't we agreed that this is just a rehearsal? Yes. Let's see, repeat it, let me hear it. Yes I know... - Well, let's see it. When... When I get tired... Or to convince myself... or lose hope, I'll come back. Yes, Ana. You can come back... Always. You'll write me? And tell me about the trout and about Jacinta. Sure. Everywhere you stay. Miss Ana Ruiz, Company of that and that... theatre. That's it. Or principal theatre. There's always one of those. Miguel... don't wait till the train leaves. No... I'll get off and keep walking. Without looking back. Without looking back. "Ernesto Sanchez Blasco is already reading the third act. His comedy is called: 'Heaven is not far away'. That's a beautiful title. As beautiful as the play itself. 'Heaven is not far away...' That's true. Heaven is now that girl, Mati, the protagonist of the play. It's for me. That role must be mine. How everyone is listening... Nobody has moved yet... The good Rafael, so sentimental, cries on the sly. And Marga has abandoned her goddess role and only smoked one cigarette. Even Manolo hasn't fallen asleep yet. That's the best sign. My colleagues look at me. They praise the work. Congratulate me. Pepito bows to me. Jose Luis applauds me. Valdes winks at me. And don Antonio smiles at me from time to time. Do?a Carmen... The critic. What could he be saying to the impresario? They look at me and will say:. 'That's Ana Ruiz, a good actress' Yes, yes. That role must be mine. Mati has been left alone upstage, with her back to the audience. Sobs wrap around her. Her hands twitch. The phone starts ringing. Mati stands up. Turns around. Comes slowly to the proscenium. Again she masters herself. She has won. The phone is still ringing... ringing... ringing. Slowly, the curtain falls. I'm leaving, but I'll be back I don't know when or how, but the day of my revenge will come and then it will be difficult for any of you to forget it. To think that this villain is the father. Excuse me. - It's nothing. Have you seen? That exit never fails me. Of course, cuckold roles fit me well. What? What's wrong? You're nervous! - Yes... When will the roles be assigned? I don't know. They should have been by now... Valdes will have them. But, listen, don't you worry. That girl... - Mati. Mati, that's it. She's you! You'll see, trust me. I hope so. Where're you going? - To see Valdes. But wait, girl, wait. You'll be late! But... You must go now. And the roles? - What? The roles, are they assigned yet? Ah, the roles... Well, no. Not yet. When? I don't know. Don Antonio still has them. When you do think that...? - On stage. I swear I don't know. You called me, dad? I didn't know... - I want to introduce you to a friend. A good one, Laura Ponce. Miss... Beautiful, Esteban. Beautiful. Your first evening gown? Good luck, little girl. Thank you, Ma'am... Laura. Thanks, Laura. - And Jose Maria? He's downstairs and wants to meet you. - Well, I'll go there in a moment. It's just... he wants an important talk with you. Don't waste time, Esteban. - Tell him to come up right away! It's not what you think, Laura. Well, tell him to come up anyway. Then... Excuse me. What? - About what? The roles. - What are you talking about? The play's roles. Are they assigned yet? No, not yet, as far as I know. - I'll go see. Ana, don't be so foolish. We begin right away. Wait for me. My part in "Heaven is not far away". Valdes has given it to me now. - Valdes? Where is he? I don't know. In the dressing rooms above, I suppose. Ana, wait! Valdes! My part! Miss Ruiz... Miss Ruiz... Miss Ruiz. Thanks. This one? Mati's part is for the lead actress of the company. - Not now, not now. - Ana, Ana. Don't enter now. Not now. It's impossible now in an instant... I hope you forgive my delay. I hope you forgive my delay. I hope you forgive my delay I hope you forgive my delay I hope you forgive my delay. I hope you forgive my delay, but... The important thing is that I'm already here. Well, I want to talk to you - Of course, she had already warned me. Well, I'd better leave you alone. - Very well, very well. Sit down, son, Sit down. I'm listening. I don't think you could ever imagine... I don't think you could ever imagine what I've come to tell you. How important it is for me to speak with you. How important it is for me to speak with you. Why? But, why? Who does that spoilt brat think she is? And where were you? I already told you it's been impossible. How could it have happened? You're all fools. All of you! What a mess! We had to skip my scene! What a mess! Valdes! Valdes! Do?a... do?a Carmen wants you to go... to go to her dressing room. Tell do?a Carmen Miss Ruiz isn't here. - But she's waiting for you. Haven't you heard? She's not here! - But, Marga, understand that I... Go away! Miss Ruiz isn't here. Don Antonio told me that... Miss Ruiz isn't here. Come in, idiot, come in. You could have said it was you. - I didn't know we were at war. Why not wait for me in the car? Baby, I just wanted to know if you were going to sleep in the dressing room. Listen, baby... - Don't call me baby. Well. Listen, that girl is... - It's none of your business. Ignore her. She's a little nervous. Really... - I'm Ana Ruiz. How are you? Pretty good. And you? I am... - You shut up. May I present Paco Torres. You know... My business associate. Let's go. Where are you taking me? Wherever you want - Wherever you want... You exasperate me. And tonight I want to kill someone. Like me? - Come, take me dancing, drinking. Today I want to get drunk - Don't you want to get drunk with us. Ana? Don't be foolish, let's go. - Thank you. As for getting drunk... Hey, and why not? You come with us. Tell her. - Want to come with us, Ana? Yes, with great pleasure, I need to amuse myself. Don't you have a friend? Yes, he's outside. - Why not say so before? You haven't let me. - Well, bring him. Let's hope he's presentable... You already know Marga, don't you? And this is Ana Ruiz. Carlos Marquez. Nice to meet you. Are we going out? - Lets see if it's possible. While you don't direct the traffic. - Oh, how sweet, don't you think? Come, let's dance. - You don't know a single dance step. But I jump very well instead. Tired of the trip? It's the second time tonight you've run away from the table. and gone thousands of kilometers away. Can I accompany you the next time? - No. Prohibited area. A certified document is required. - You'll get it. I've a lot of influence. It's alright. I surrender. This entire conversation is like a high comedy. And I don't know what to say. Lets talk about simpler things. - Then, of me. The high comedy is still speaking... Well then, of you... Can I ask you some things? For sure. What do you do? Yes, what's your job? Business... - So original. What kind of business? Theatre Theatre? So you are Marquez, Carlos Marquez. At least that's what I believe. What a fool I've been. Forgive me. When we were introduced, I was... I know, you were just back from one of those trips. Exactly. It was a terrible mistake of mine. Yes? - Of course. If I'd known it from the very beginning I'd have been sparkling all night. Do you have something now? - With the theatre? No. Actually, no. It depends on my mood. Maybe I'll form a company or rent a theatre, and work on that one of two years. Then, one day, I leave it, and vacations. Decent. - The vacations? The company, especially. What? - The lead actress. I know... There's not much to choose from. You said it. Not much. Sometimes, it's worth taking a risk and launching a new star. You think so? - Yes. And I'm sorry for never having seen you work. You haven't missed much. - I have reports. Good reports. - I'm glad. You may have noticed I'm a big risk. Maybe. I hope to see you acting soon. Do you have a good part in Blasco's comedy? Yes, indeed. A good one. Maybe too good for me. I think that, from now on, you won't be able to see me work. Why not? I'm leaving the company, saying farewell. Why? May I ask why? I'd prefer not to. I don't want to cause them any harm. I won't work in tomorrow's play, They'll have time to find another actress. You've spoken with don Antonio? - Yes. What did he say? - Nothing. Very well, very well. Well then, I wish you all the best. Shut up! Luisa. You can leave now. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Hypocrite! What did you say? Yes, Hypocrite! All the best. "I wish you all the best." And you told everyone I stole your part. That's a lie. I didn't! - But you thought it! Yes, for sure. And it's true, you stole my part. So what? Isn't it my company? Isn't it my money? Aren't I the owner of everything. It's my home. I can do whatever I want! I want that part! You're not able to. It's the only thing you can't do. You're too... old! No...! Too old... Forgive me... I just wanted to say... I understand. I understand. Too much... for that part. I could never show those years on stage... Right? Yes. For sure. I have... I have something more. Something more. Excuse me, I'd like to... - Wait a moment. Don't leave. The hysteria is over. Tired? Yes. Very tired. Two performances, afternoon and evening, every day of the year. Every year... since then. Just imagine. I was 13 years old. Well... In the "interviews" I say I was 8. You know why. Then, the 'la Pino' Company. "The Sister Gatekeeper" Acacia in "La malquerida", my first success. Suddenly, I was playing the In?s role. "The doctorate" and "Malvaloca". "The cheerful genius". And then I was no longer Carmen Soler, I was do?a Carmen. And now always top billing! And now always the main part. The one with most lines. There's no remedy, Anita. You can't rest now. They don't let you. This comedy of Blasco's isn't that bad. We'll see. What do you expect from that part? Another triumph? Sure. - Haven't you had enough? Aren't they enough? - No. It's never enough. I see. It would be very noble if I... Very beautiful. I could give you Matilde's part and take Susana's. It's also beautiful and fits me well. Fits me better. By age. I'm sorry, Ana. The assignment is done. It can't be changed. Nor can I force you to stay if you don't like it. That's your problem. - I've already decided. I'm leaving. - As you wish. I wish you luck, Ana. Really. - Me too, do?a Carmen. Goodbye. An actors' cafe. That's our lair, our club, our refuge. And also a market, a job exchange, an exposition, a communications centre. Here we all come: those who work and the unemployed. Those acting in Madrid and those passing through. Like every afternoon, there's Do?a Concha. They say she was very beautiful and famous. She's in a home. She always comes to be remembered. And that is Pepe. An agent, an actor's broker. Well, let's see your thing. How sore my throat is. Want one? Here it is. The Mu?oz San Juan is in La Coru?a. Probably coming to Madrid for the summer. 12 duros. 13 at most. To Marruecos and Canarias, with 'la Sanchez'. Three months, 15 duros. Repertory: "The Last of the Queens". To Barcelona, full season. I don't think you'll like it. They already have Antonia, Do you want to go after her? Well now, something really nice! Some gigs in Toledo, Cuenca and Salamanca. Earn as much as you sell. It's to do the Infanta's thing. Well, that's it for today. I told you it was hard. - I didn't believe that hard. In full season and without a sponsor, with all the things you ask for? You'll have to lower your rate. This is it, want to go with Pastora Quiroga? They begin in Madrid with a thing called... "Andalusian Spell". There I can get you more salary. I don't know anything about flamenco. - No. Nothing about singing or dancing If anything, you appear in the apotheosis. There no one will notice. Then, what do I do? You appear and announce something like: "The plow is lit with orange blossom and the moon embroiders silver stars." Right? No, of course not. Anyway... We'll see, my child. It's very difficult to find you some work. Very difficult. Hey, Pepe. - Can you lend me some money? Something wrong? - Yes. Just a couple of days more and I'll be leaving with your gypsies. Can't you? No, sweetie. I can't. Business is bad all round. I'm sorry. Why don't you ask your old boss? Hello. Good afternoon. Do you mind? - It's a surprise to see you here. I've come to take you with me. I want you to come back with us. She too. Don't act like a child. In full season, with all sold-out. Self-love will hold you back. - Do you want something, don Antonio? - Yes, bring me some cognac. And you, Ana? Nothing, thank you. - Cognac. Listen to my proposal. The general rehearsal for Blasco's play goes on within a week. I have reserved your part. Well, a part. Not the big one, just the tiny one. The one that was given to you. - So what? I can't wait any longer now, nor can you. I beg you to come with us. - But the thing is that... Forget your self-love Do you promise to think about it? Well, I'll think it over. - You must be at the general rehearsal. I'll think about it, really. Thank you. And now, excuse me, they're waiting for me. Carlos Marquez? Yes. It seems you don't like him. - Collectors annoy me. Yes, collectors. Stamp collectors are harmless, but this one... This one? What does he collect? - Lead actresses. Goodbye. - Don't forget. You must be there for the general rehearsal. Sure, the general rehearsal, and nothing matters. The lights aren't ready, nor the dresses, and the actors... Nothing's ready! That's the general rehearsal! Don't you worry, Ernesto. You'll see that tomorrow everything will be fine. For the premiere nothing fails. - May heaven hear it! Is it possible? "Heaven's not far away". Well, let's keep going. But, and that lamp! - Manolo! I know! - So then? From the lamp? - A little before. Your line, Carmen. What do you want? They are simple people, very peaceful. You can't expect anything brilliant from them. Isn't a single light better? I don't like the ceiling lamp. It can be cheaper. Is it better now? Yes, thanks. Much better. Is it still snowing? - Not like before, it won't stick. I thought you weren't coming, it's too late. Yes, I was going go close the car, but it was snowing. I thought of you. I'll take you home. Thank you. Where have you been? - Having a drink with Clemente Valle. The businessman from Barcelona? - Yes, I was having dinner with him... and his wife. - I see. Are you still thinking about that? - Yes, I'm determined. I want to form a company for Gloria's Saturday. Good plays, good actors. It will be good business. Do you already have employees? - Yes, that's easy. The difficult thing was to find the lead actress. And I've already found her. Are you sure? - Of having found her, yes. Of having her, a little less. Is that your part? May I? Does it seem bad to you? - It seems small. Do you think I can do better? - Why not? Do you think I have talent? - Yes. As much as that lady or Amelia Vargas. Or Valle's wife, right? Or like Valle's wife, yes. You just need a chance. Good luck. - Like what? A good part. For example, the one of 'Mati' that you like so much. By doing this, Sara Bernal would have gone unnoticed. Or a helping hand. A good friend. Someone who believes in you. And surely someone like Carlos Marquez. Excuse me, I have to go on stage. I swear that this won't happen again! What reason is there? - Always with your reasons! You never leave room for the imagination. Fantasy... Has that fantasy been any use to you? - You don't think so? Hello. I'm not bothering you? Someone has brought you this. What does it contain? What kind of invisible telegram is that? But, Ernesto! - Yes, I know. Everything's going wrong now. At the premiere, everything will be fine. The lights can be turned off too, telegrams can disappear, shots don't sound, and the doors don't work either. And then, what? For God's sake, just a little formality! Calm down. It's okay. It's only nerves. Happy you, who don't have them! Yes I do, but they're more used than yours. Let's go again! Manolo! I'm innocent! The telegram was in its place. It was my fault, I didn't see it. - I hope you see it tomorrow. Well, let's go. With your departure, Ana. I saw you in the stalls with your Carlos. Why "your Carlos"? I don't have the exclusive. That's true. But only three of us know it: you, him and me. Go convince the others. I don't have to convince anyone. - Neither yourself? Of what? Listen. I'll show you my tactic. It really bugs me to see you with Marquez. He's not for you, he's a nasty piece of work. - I don't see why. He's quite nice and he's an impresario. Ana, you know the big impresarios... - Impresarios? The fat ones. I'm serious. He's not fat at all. A fat one would be harmless. A fat man wouldn't be presentable. You have good taste. Listen, I'm going to be quite blunt for a moment, just for once. I'll talk like a... character role, that type who act the mother and give good advice. I don't want any advice. I can tell you: "Be original. Don't look for a... a business associate". Marga! - It's an elegant way of putting it. There are worse ones. - You don't have to say it. I know. But you don't want to know that's the worst solution. Why? What I'm I going to do? Keep waiting? Work in any company? See myself a great actress only through a critic's praise? Live badly in bad lodging houses, in horrid trains, in seedy villages? - Yes, yes and yes! All that! It's your job. All that! And also, to fight. You have no faith in yourself. - Yes. Yes indeed. I think I'm good. That I'm worth more than anyone. I can succeed. And I want to. No matter how. And if you fail, then what will happen? Things won't be the same for you anymore. You can't return to those lodging houses, to third-class dressmakers, to half-weekly advances... No. You won't be able to. What will that matter then? - This is why. Then, it'll be all the same. Always someone who pays your bills and increases your salary. Always by your side... let's say an impresario. Always one and always with a different name. You'll have a reputation for elegance, nobody like you will embellish the plays. You'll be a supporting actress of great class, like me. It's the second call, right? - Don't think so. It's possible? How could it be the third? - Who said the third? Ramon! Ramon! Is it the third? Oh, excuse me! Pepito, have we had the third yet? - The third? Not yet! Don Antonio! Where's don Antonio? - How should I know! Hello. Nervous? - No. - Please, keep off the stage! Manolo! Where's don Antonio? - How should I know! Manolo! Where were you hiding? - That's what I say! Come on, give the third call. - Come on, I'm going to start. The third call. - I won't make it. Prompt! Do you know where Fernandez is? I wish for a peaceful and wonderful world... Ready, do?a Carmen? Whenever you want. Find me Fernandez! I wish for a peaceful and wonderful world... Starting! That curtain! And that table! What's that table doing there? How's the theatre? - Terrible, full of people. Out everyone! You, get off now! Calm down! Did you see Fernandez? Jesus. - What? Try the signals, will you? OK, OK. Ready, don Antonio. - Come on, we're running late. Power! Lights on stage! Spot bar! The disc. Up whenever you want, Jesus. Have you seen Fernandez? Gerardo, do you know if...? Sorry, I thought Geraldo was here. - No, he's not here. Do you know him? - No, but I know I'm not him. I must look for him. Wait, please. Don't go yet. That Gerardo can wait. You didn't tell me your name. I'm Matilde, but my friends just call me Mati. I don't envy her. It's strange. Now I don't envy her. Now I just want her to go on her way. May she be lucky. It's done, it's already begun. There's no remedy now. Blasco is suffering so much. Is this what he thought? These men and women are his creatures. It's really strange. One stops being who one is and suddenly, one is someone else. I'm not Ana. I'm not an actress. I'm Mercedes and I'm a simple bourgeois girl. Marga is not my friend, I don't even know her. She must be introduced to me. Blasco is uneasy. Why don't the public laugh at this line? And now, why do they cough? Is it fine? Is it really going well? Yes, everything. The first act is over. Good news. Everything is running smoothly. Nothing's gone wrong. Marga turns off the lights, and the light turns off. Maybe Blasco will convince himself that everything is fine for the premiere. Nothing is forgotten. Not even the telegram. Each moment he's more confident. Well, not much. Everything can sink in just an instant. Someone said that the finale is dangerous. We've already reached it. Everything is going fine. Everything is going fine. Everything is going fine. No, I don't envy her. Although she's taking my part. Good luck. Good luck. Good Luck... Stop that, will you? Hope... What? - Hope. That lousy hope. Have you never heard that? - No, I don't think so. It's a play I once did. So? - Nothing. I thought that... The hope of success is what drives me, is what... Carlos, do you think that...? Do you have faith? - In you? In an actress called Ana Ruiz? I'll tell you, not much. Of course she has a certain practice. Good stage presence. But she's absolutely unknown. She has never played any part of more that twenty lines. And no newspaper has ever given her more than one. The highest praise for her have always been "in tune"... "discreet", "exact"... What critics say to say nothing. Don't you think it's better to answer like that? Ana, things are much simpler than that. Less theatrical than you see them. And if it...? - If not, what? If it didn't work out, if I were a failure. Yes, Carlos, it's true. I really don't know.. No one. No one can know that. Don't say anything, not you. Ana, try to understand. Suppose that Gloria's Saturday was in Barcelona or Madrid. A billboard with huge letters saying: "Carlos Marquez presents Ana Ruiz, with that guy and someone else, in the three-act comedy of someone". What's the result? Success. Result? Success. - Why? Because that guy can be and will be Agustin Navarro, a true actor. And the other guy will be Antonio Lomas, another good one. And the comedy will be by Blasco or Lopez Dariga, and sets by Eugenio Duran. And everything will be top quality, and everything will be the best available, because the lead actress, that Ana Ruiz, is a nobody. Nobody knows her. - No, she's nobody. And nobody knows her, and nobody will ever know her. She will remain just another name in the cast. She will remain what it says here. Take it and read it. Read the reviews of the premiere and say once more what you want. I don't know. - Don't know, don't know... I do. Keep playing idiotic parts in idiotic plays. And wait. Ah, but wait decently. Because suddenly one day Cecil B. DeMille will appear and take you to Hollywood to play opposite Clark Gable. But while the miracle doesn't happen, wait majestically and curse the lead actress in any town cafe. If you have hopes of succeeding in the theatre or whatever you must trust yourself, only yourself. And if you trust, you must take a chance. It's stupid to stand by and then cry. You have to face things head on. I trust myself. I hope to succeed. I can succeed. Nobody will steal the applause that already sounds for Ana Ruiz. But... I don't know... There's only one thing that messes up this hope. To reach the triumph along this path. But now it seems that I have no another. But it disgusts me to be your darling. Without that you'll get nowhere. Well, maybe through boredom you'll become the girl of some colleague. Or maybe, one has to be optimistic, the legitimate wife of some ham actor of your class. You know, the loneliness of the lodging houses. Those horrible trips, the boredom... Being my... Well, being mine, two things can happen. You may succeed. If you do, you save yourself. From me, of course. And you may fail. You save yourself too. In another way, naturally. Is it worth it? It's worth it. Are you completely sure? Yes. What did he say? - Search me? Now you mustn't worry at all, Carmen. Don't worry at all. It's nothing. May I? - Doctor, what's wrong with her? Nothing serious, but you must take care of her. So it's pneumonia. Pneumonia? No. - Seeing how it hurt her here when she breathed... No, it's not pneumonia. She has pleurodynia. Go buy this medicine. The pain will be relieved right away. There you have the instructions. Thank god, we don't have to cancel. - Cancel? What do you mean? - That do?a Carmen can work. Absolutely not. - Why not? She can't go on stage. She must rest. - Do you know what you're saying? Naturally. She mustn't work at least for a couple of days. And injections or things like that can't do anything? She must follow the treatment I prescribed, rest included. But, what rest? How can I cancel the performance with it sold-out? That's not my business. I've already said what must be done, and I regret not being able to force you. Good afternoon. Manolo, accompany the doctor to the door. - Of course, don Antonio. Well, what? - What, what? We must cancel the performance. - Don't be foolish. How can we cancel it? It's sold out. Antonio, that's impossible. It's Saturday and eight days to the premiere. That's it, Saturday. And tomorrow, Sunday. Cancel... It'll ruin us. Disgusting Disgusting. How can we cancel? It means our ruin. While the actor survives... - It's not that bad. Carmen can play her part. She just has to play it sitting. After all, it's just talking. - Then why don't you do it, idiot. Antonio! Be careful. - Come on, come on! Don't act like children. Let's think calmly. We realize that it's unfortunate, but, understand that... - Yes, I understand. I understand that whilst the actor breathes, even a little, the show must go on. as long as he can talk. Antonio. Antonio. - Carmen, do you want something? Don't argue. It's useless, you both know it. Carmen, you can't work. You can't. Yes, I can. At least this afternoon. I'm already dressed - And evening? Evening, I don't think I can. There's a solution. Ana... She can replace me. Do you think she can? - For sure. She knows the part. She's always known all my parts. - And will she want it? Of course - Wonderful! Elvirita can do her part. After all, it's only twenty lines. - How do you feel, do?a Carmen? - Better. Thank you. Then, what? The second call? Yes. Manolo, tell Ana to come here. The third call? Already? If I could only stay calm... It's impossible, I don't know the part. How can I remember so many words? It's awful! What's that line... Yes, yes. I'm coming right now. I'm Ana Ruiz. Now I'm going to play my part. It's my opportunity. I've waited long enough. But what will I say? What do I have to say? I'm here already. How good everyone is. They'll help me, they'll say my lines. They will cover my mistakes. But no. No! I'm Ana, I will say my part word for word. They will see. And this furniture? And these doors? Yes, I appear from here, I sit there... Don Antonio explains it all I don't undestand a word he says. Calm down, just calm down. Oh, if I could hear you, Jesus. It would be so easy... Isn't it rather chilly? Manolo will help me. I don't remember a thing. Not a thing! Spot bar! Now I must say my part. Now I must say my part. My part! Why is everyone silent out there? What silence. They are silent and wait for me. Why? What do I have to say? What do I have to say? What?! Now... Now I have to say... Gerardo, do you know if? Gerardo, do you know if? Gerardo, do you know if...? Gerardo, do you know if...? Sorry, I thought Geraldo was here. - No, he's not here. Do you know him? - No, but I know I'm not him. I'd better introduce myself. My name is Arturo Planas, and I'm that indispensable man in all elegant soirees, althought I ask myself why. Excuse me, I must find him. - You haven't told me your name. I'm Matilde, but my friends just call me Mati. I'm Matilde. My friends call me Mati. And my enemies What must they call me? Should I smile to hide my fury? What right do you have to speak to me that way? You are defeated. There was a time when you were so sure of yourself and called yourself Arturo Planas's wife. How ridiculous. We all knew the truth. How much I wanted this moment to come. Women pretend to be. We know how to be elegant and friendly. But in the end we only want to bare our hearts. Yes, now begins the longest twilight. The most desolate hour. Surely, heaven is not far away. I want to trust that it's there. Within reach of my hand or my desire. No. Heaven is not far away. Just close your eyes. And when one day I open them, when I can take no more... and find myself alone again, hopelessly alone, between these high and overwhelming walls, when I convince myself that the passing of the hours for me is not hope, there will only be tears in my eyes. Crying for me and for you and for everyone else. Crying for the last star that shines each dawn. I know that this happiness can't be eternal. That's why I hold on to these minutes. I know what my ending is: to love you. To love you desperately, blindly. My love, what love? There are words that mean nothing, that no mouth utters, that no ear will ever hear. Mati, I'm Mati. Created by you and also destroyed by you. Perhaps. Through all these years I have kept my hatred towards you. Well, you will be alone. That's my vengeance. - Fernando. You know what will happen, and yet... - Even so! You don't scare me. You can't scare me anymore! Go then. Build the most awful fate, but don't ever try to return. I'll nail up my doors, tear out my eyes... Run away, Fernando. Run! Fernando! Fernando! Good night. And congratulations, Anita. - See you tomorrow, dear. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Congratulations. Well done, Ana. Ana, aren't you going to bed now? Happy, and tired too. Doesn't seem so, I'm right? Be a good girl and go to sleep. See you tomorrow. Don Antonio. - Yes? Don Antonio, Have I really acted well? As well as they said? Truly? - Truly. Rarely has an actress moved me like you. Rarely. So rarely. Maybe... Maybe for the first time. - How is it possible? I was so nervous... - Nervous? Yes, nervous. And frightened and dazed. I made so many mistakes. - It's possible. I didn't notice.. And I got so many things horribly wrong. Like the scene in the second act with you and Marga. Tomorrow I'll be calmer. Tomorrow I'll do well. I think that tomorrow... There'll be no tomorrow. What? - There'll be no tomorrow. Carmen feels better. Tomorrow she'll play her part again. Good night. You were amazing. Daddy is proud of you. In the final scene you managed to give me goose bumps. Come on, what are you standing there for? Let's go. Are you tired? Which do you prefer? Take you home to sleep like a good actor until two, or go and celebrate. Look, it's early yet. Let's go to that place you like. Where we met, huh? No. - As you wish. Come, I'll take you home. I won't go with you. - What? - I won't go anywhere with you. Fine! Do you want to leave the theatre? Ana, what's the matter? Has success gone to your head? Ana, don't stand there like that! Say something! Has the applause made you crazy? Ana! It seems you haven't heard me. I said I won't go anywhere with you. Well then, am I to understand that you want to be rid of me? - Yes. And what will you do? Form a company by yourself or give some recitals? I don't know. Keep going. Well, keep going. A tour of the provinces and all that, right? Congratulations. I'm to understand that you're going back on what we agreed. Yes. And it occurred to you now, Right at this very moment. Yes. Go back home. We'll talk tomorrow or another day, when you're calmer. - We've nothing to discuss. Don't drive me up the wall. May I know what's wrong with you? What's this all about? I don't even know myself. Then... then you want to end it all. Yes. Ana... Don't leave me. You're so nice, so... So wonderful. Let me stay with you. As you wish, any way you wish. No. - Why not? I've said I don't know. I just don't know. It's... It's hope. Hope has returned to you. Perhaps. - Then... Goodbye. Truly? - Yes. Goodbye, Carlos. Goodbye. Translated and Synchronization by namenlos12 & corvusalbus for KG.
