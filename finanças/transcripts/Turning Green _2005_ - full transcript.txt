No! This is Ireland. The land of my mother and father. This is Ireland... the land where a man survives off its bounty and thrives off its beauty. This is Ireland, the terrible beauty. The land of poets, preachers, saints, and scholars. This is Ireland to me. This is Wicklow, on the east coast of this shitty island. And this is Mackey's... shitty port to match this shitty island. All right.You're in? You're in. £2 each. Hmm? Are you sure?Yes. Mm-hmm. You don't want to consult the wife? Just get on with this. And this is me, James Powers. I'm about to do something stupid. Okay. Here's one. 2... So we're all the same, right? Come on now. Okay. That's four. How you doing, huh? For God's sake. Whoop! Why, the fucker did it, huh? Ha ha ha! ...impress these people. They're not my friends. Uh, I have none. I do this to take their money little by little so eventually I can get the fuck out of here. Next time you can add sucking my dick to that as well. You said that last week. See, I don't belong here. I'll never ever belong here. Here's what happened.Jesus fucking Christ. My mom died, and my dad didn't want us... nice... so he shipped Pete and I here from America six years ago to live with our three heinous aunts, and this is what it's come to. I wasn't born here. I only live here. And I'm sure as hell not going to die here. You're green.

Where is he? Ah. Of course. Father, if you'd like some more vegetables, I'm sure now James would be happy to give you a taste of his. Oh, that's very kind of you, Maggie, but it won't be necessary. Father, would you like a little bit more ham? I've kept it warm for you. Oh, 'tis a fine piece of ham, Mary, but I've had my share. I'll take some more ham. None left. Save room for dessert, Father? I will.He will. That's enough of your hangdog look, Sir James. Eat up that broccoli. And did you take your pills? Is there something wrong with him? You see, Father, the boy's a wee bit constipated. I'm sure that broccoli now will do him a world of good. We could all do with a bit more roughage in our diet. What are you saying there, now, Maggie? Have you considered the cod liver oil? It works wonders on internal matters. He spends his days in the toilet, the poor boy. James... The boy is sick. Did you wash your hands? Makes me go something fierce. Jesus. God save us, James. Don't take the Lord's name in vain. Why must you be so im... Immature? Impatient.Impolite? Improper.Impudent. Impudent.Impudent is right. You should listen to your brother, Seamus. Hmm? Who's Seamus? Don't get wise with me, young man. You know your Irish name. Mm-hmm. I do, Mike, but it's not my name. That's Father O'Hara, and nothing else. How about you keep your dead language to yourself? James. Not to mention your dead religion. Well, I... You're almost... Oh, now, that is too much. ...slithering little... I had the most wonderful effect on these people. ...barbarians, you know that? Oh. What? Those are the nicest tits I've ever seen. But you've never...Never mind. Take a look at this. One of the few people I can actually tolerate is my little brother. Kind of sad when your only friend's an 11-year-old kid, but whatever. Chickenfeed tomoshite. Look at my sister, ya fuck! You filthy little scupper, ya! Pete and I have all sorts of fun together. Christ. The thing is he doesn't talk much. It's the lisp. The fact that the letter S is even in the word "lisp" is kind of cruel, but Pete found a way around it. To him, he didn't have a lisp. He had...A palate impediment. And he carried this concept over to his daily life. "Success" became...A lack of failure. Jesus wasn't Jesus or even the Messiah. He was...Yahweh. Emmanuel. or plain old...God. Synonyms. He probably had an S-free synonym for "synonym." I have a deep respect for a man who can work around an obstacle. Don't you? Johnny Bench. Uh, second? Mmm... My God. His name is easy. Oh. Joe Morgan. Yeah. Third? Third. Third. Uh... Third. I know this one. I do. Uh... Mike Schmidt. Come on. Are you joking? Say it. Um... Say "Mike Schmidt." I had it in my head just then. Every American kid in the world knows Mike Schmidt. Uh... Are you kidding me? Mike fucking Schmidt, man! Ron Cey. No. It's not Ron Cey. Shit. Come on. I'll get you a new ball. Did... Did you say something, James? Are you all right in there? Yeah, I'm fine. Lord save us. Where's me paper? I swear to God, that gobshite paper boy is out smoking weed with his criminal friends instead of delivering papers to decent people. I've got it in here. You know I forbid that. How long have you been in there polluting my paper? Since half past 4. Seems the constipation's got the better of him. Jesus, James. Three quarters of an hour doing your business? Broccoli hasn't been doing the trick. Why, it could be the problem. I can only s-speak for meself, but I'm as right as rain. Ah, for God's sake, shut up. Try to breathe, James, in and out. In and out. He's not giving birth, for God's sake! James, you shove my newspaper out under that door and quit this nonsense. It's simple truth. There is no worse place in the world to jerk off than Ireland. James! Give me me paper! Must be God's will. 16 times, Father. 11 times, Father. 18 times, Father. ...since your last confession, my son? Since Friday, Father. Only out of respect for my mom I still come here. God has no use for me. I occasionally have a use for him. New York is down by 3 here in the second. It's a beautiful day here at Flushing. Not a cloud in the sky. Hey, Charlie. How's business? Oh, business ain't too bad now. What'll it be, gents? Two pints. That'll be a pound. A pound? Happy Hour. Being new customers. But we're the only ones here. And we're always here. Aye. You ever notice that nobody asks anybody what they are around here? No. In America, people ask people what they are, and people say "Oh, I'm half German" or "I'm half Italian" or "I'm a quarter this or that or whatever." Yeah? People don't do that here. Well, maybe because everyone here are all Irish. Not us. We're not? No. That's what I'm getting at. In America, we're Irish. We're 100%... Right. £2. 2? Happy Hour's over, so... We ordered before it ended, so... You just waited. You can't rush a pint, boy. You should order the whiskey if you was in so much of a hurry. Right, Timmy? I'm Irish. We got to get out of here. Okay. How? I'm 16 years old. I quit school six months ago. That's Bill. He's a bookie. Bill the Bookie is what they call him. Clever. I'm doing what you'd call an internship, I suppose. Bill's a strong man with strong opinions about people, but it's rare when you know what they are, which is why he's dangerous. I have no idea how he feels about me. Obviously, I don't ever do any of the muscle work. That's what the other Bill's for. Aah! He's a moron and an asshole, too stupid for Bill not to trust, so he's good. They call him Bill the Breaker. So a fine one you got there, James. You at least get a good shot in? Not really. Ah. It's the little fucker. Ah, keep quiet there, Bill. I'm busy. You know, this little fellow didn't even get a look in. You don't say. I could have told you that. What do you mean, Billy? Well, your man here is a complete pussy. It's my boy he fought. But don't underestimate him, Bill. He hurt me boy, too. You should have used his hands. Must have used his hands a hundred times against that head of his. Always with the jokes. Fuck off. That's enough, boys. You know, James... you remind me of meself a bit. Reminds me of how I earned a reputation worth keeping. Getting your arse kicked around all day? When I left Cranny, I was maybe 11. I was a little shite, too. And I knew Limerick was a rough town. Ah, rough town. That weren't a rough town. In Cranny, your worst beating would have come from your ma. Cranny, not a rough town. Should never admit that, Bill. What are you, Jerry Lewis? Go fetch me a pint, will you? Thirsty. So my father says to me before he left, he says, "If you're going to get into a row, "which is unavoidable in Limerick, don't go fighting a guy who fucked with you." And I said... "What you mean by that, Da?" And he says... for effect, I suppose, so I'd remember it, you know. Yeah. Whispers in me ear, then he kisses me on the cheek, and off I go. What did he whisper? I'm... I'm getting there. Sure enough, second day I was there, I met up with a gang of fucking toughs who were out to start. A lad maybe my size come up and give me a box in the head for no reason other than I fucking happened to be there. He's just standing there with his shit-eating grin across his ugly mug. So I get up off the path. And I run. But not away. I raced straight past the fucker who smacked me, and I jump in the air. So now I haven't a clue what to do next. On top of this guy, staring right at him, face to face. Aah! And you won the fight. No, they beat the shit out of me. I was laid up in St. Joe's for two weeks. But they never ever fucked with me again. That's a fine story. It's not a story. But there is a lesson in what me father told me. He said real quiet, "Go after the biggest, and the others will run like hell." Tom. Your man, Tom, by the river. Uh-huh. He owes me 3.40. Overdue. It's the last time you visit. In the meantime, you go to the police, you tell them no, and the same goes for the boys at the bank. Got it. Where are you going to be tonight? Mackey's with Pete. How's your man Petey? Fine. Ah, he's a good boy, just like you, but a teeny bit happier. He'll get over it. Couple of pints on me. Did you know this is where Bill and his boys take the guys who can't pay? The scary thing is they don't know what they're going to do. You know, sometimes we just talk about dogs and races, and they get pints from the pub, and sometimes they... sometimes they just... rough the guy up a bit. Just, you know... every now and again. Here. Hey, look what I found. the New York Mets. When we get back, you can trade this for box seats on me. See? Huh? Can't you be decent about it just this once, huh? You cheap fecking Jew, ya. You know, try... try to be a decent Irishman about it, huh? You half-breed. Half-breed. My father's from Wicklow. Huh? And your mam is from where? Tyrone. Aha. We've been over this. Yeah. Here. Have a go. No one likes Tom much... Loosen your grip. ...except me. I don't know. Maybe it's because he reminds me of my dearly departed dad, or maybe it's because no one likes me much, either. You're holding that like a girl. Either way, I like him. You can't listen to what he says, but what he means. No one ever gets that. Anyway, you know the rules, Tom. Bill's not going to do that. Ah, feck the rules. That no-good Bill's as shifty as a Chinaman. Here. be careful. If you lose my hook, I'll stick my shoe so far up your arse, you'll taste the cow shite. Ah, for feck's sake. Here, give me that. Jesus. That's enough of that. Look... will you? Uh, do you know the dog's name? Yeah. I got it. Tom. Heh. But it's a... ...then he'll let you next time, but you can't, so I can't. You shouldn't be fucking betting anymore, Tom. You watch your mouth, you little fecker. You say fuck all the time. I do not. I say feck, which is an entirely different matter altogether. You say "potayto," I say "potahto." There's a potato up your asshole. Forget it. Look. I'm as smart as ten Bills put together, and besides, I am a man of my word. I'm just concerned. Well, you leave the concern to me. Anyway, that Bill's as thick as a Polack. I thought he was as cheap as a Jew. He is. How do you know so much about these people, Tom... Jews and Polacks and Chinamen... when you've never left this town? Listen, you're my friend, and I think you should quit betting. Friend? I'm 40 years older than you. How can I be your friend, you little scut, you. Here. Ring that number. Tell him to come over to see me after tea tomorrow. You'll have your money in two days. Fine. I'm not going to fight. See you. Fecker couldn't catch a cold with Bill... Hey, Shane. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Not so good anymore. See you. ♪ Down at 9th Street Station ♪ ♪ On a Saturday ♪ And recent considerations ♪ ♪ Sent the world astray ♪ And I can't shake this feeling off ♪ ♪ I heard them selling souls at cost ♪ ♪ So hold your head ♪ Today is tomorrow ♪ All your thoughts fall in sorrow ♪ ♪ Genuine things ♪ Still I keep comin' ♪ An absolute affirmation If I ever want to make it back to America, I'm not going to do it on the shit money I'm making now. So I've constructed a thoughtful comprehensive list of all my... Any luck? Uh, the boys at the bank are square. O'Connor's paid up, footing out his kid. Um, everyone in Greystone's is paid. Father O'Hara is 40 short, but he offered to make that up in novenas. Hmm. That's a fine trade-off. Better pray I don't come back for me 40. So that's... 480 for today and no work for Bill. And I have to see Paulick by the lake. And Tom by the river. Yeah. I know. Maybe Bill will have some work after all. I thought you said three weeks. Oh, I know what I said. Something else? Um... If you're asking for more money, I've got 20 lads lined up for your job. No. Hello. Jesus. Knock before you come in, not as you come in, Maggie. Sick, are you? Yeah, a little. Is it drink? Oh, James, try and stay off the drink. You're a young boy. No, it's not the drink. I think I have a cramp or a stomachache. Oh, you're not fooling me. Your Auntie Maggie isn't as knackered as you think. I know what's going on. I've seen you looking at the girls. I know you have a thing for that Fiona one. Ohh. I was young once, too. Paulick McKinney was his name. The sweet little face on him. The big, broad shoulders. And his lovely mustache. I'd say I did the very same thing as you... ...the only thing on me mind. Of course, I couldn't do what you do, mind, but I know the feeling. There's nothing like it. So let's have a look. What? Come on, shy boy. Let your old Auntie Maggie have a look. I can tell you if she'd like it. No. All right, shy boy. I'll leave you alone to... Oh, so upset over a bit of poetry. I've seen you writing in this book of yours. Oh, now, if you want help with a rhyme, talk to Mary. She's a whirl with a rhyme. What rhymes with "Fiona"? Maggie's a bit of a boob, but she's right about Fiona. Are you expecting anyone? Excuse me. Are you expecting anyone? No. Thanks. I'm in love with her. Keep your goddamn trousers on. Here. Tell your man I want half of that on Uncle Tom. Right? Yeah. Talk to you soon. Tom would sell anything he owns, even his boat, just to keep his awe-inspiring losing streak alive. He's out. Where is he? He said just leave it here. No. I deliver my own. I'll call back later. Suit yourself. Enough is enough. I'm not living this way no more. Sure, who'd know better than Dr. Fitzpatrick? It's quite a bit of money, don't you agree? he spends his days on the toilet, the poor creature. The least we could do is send him to London. London is a difficult place for a young boy. How'd he get around? In a red Mercedes sports car. What do you think? He'll walk. Anyway, Katherine will take him. You better start behaving yourself, young fella, me lad. We didn't even ask the boy if he wanted to go. James, would you like to go to London? So I had a choice... some doctor probing my ass in London, or I could just stay here. You all right in there, love? Yeah, I'm fine. England. The polar opposite. The diametrically opposed. The receptive yin to Ireland's hostile yang. Everybody here hates Ireland as much as I do. So this tiny window on my sad life, my heart lifted. Everything at Aunt Katherine's will be different. Hi. From what? You're letting in the goddamn cold. Get in. In fact, everything is identical. Did you take your pills? They're twins. I thought Aunt Mary was awful. Then I spent some time with her sister Katherine. England, Ireland, Mary, Katherine. It made no difference. There was no hope. Then, in my darkest hour, I met my savior. And he had friends, too. White girls, black girls, skinny and fat. Asian, English, Mexican, Indian. Everyone but Irish. These girls didn't exist in Ireland because these magazines didn't. Did you have a good day? Fine. How was yours? Grand. Why? Don't know. You asked me. I'll get that. After jerking off for five hours to the finest in English pornography, I came to realize that maybe it provided the one ounce of pleasure I could derive in this shitty world and something I could dedicate myself to fully and honestly. Dr. Fitzpatrick says you're as fit as a fiddle. You can go home to Ireland tomorrow, so. I'll phone Mary. James. James. Open me. Where are you? You know where I am. Open me. Page 38. Thank you, James. Now, let's get down to business. Not that kind of business, dear James. Do you know why I'm here talking to you? Well, I'll tell you, then. Please, turn the page. You have your goal... a brave and beautiful goal... to get back to America, but you don't know how to get there. Yeah. I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna... I know, James. I know. But watch your language around a pretty girl. What you must do is find a way. Find a way, find a way... It's staring you right in the face. What? You like me, don't you? Yes. You may not be the only one. Only one, only one... I need your help. I can help. Pick her up! Pick her up! Well, there's me old boyo. Good man. Welcome home. What's he doing, scratching his arse? Paddy in Rath Naoi has 160 on your man there, but he wants an excuse to visit him because his dog keeps shitting in his yard. Dark Horse is the name. Really?Mm. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Bad bet there, Billy. Ah. So, James, how are things? London good? Yeah. London was... London was good. Hmm. Say, did you collect any before you went away? No. All right. I'm going for a piss, so... Pints go through me like a bullet these days. You coming, boys? Yeah. Fucking stinks like shite in here. It's the jerks, Bill. What have you been up to? Uh, same as always. Shattering the illusions of every dreamer in Ireland. You know, your man Tom is in arrears, too. I didn't see him before I left, but he'll come up with it, I'm sure. Yeah. No doubt. How's your, uh, little problem? Better, huh? The doctor said it was fine, nerves or something. Hmm. That's good, so. Your aunts were worried sick about you. Of course it might have been your aunt who made you sick in the first place. If it's not her dinner, it's her dinner conversation. Mind you, I've never had a meal of hers meself. But I've heard stories. Ah, well, you know, you don't have to be on the fucking Titanic to know it sank, if you know what I mean. We always know what you mean. No collects at all? Nope. Just, uh, Fitzpatrick's 50 for... for Bonner's Glory. But you got that. Mm, yeah, I got that one. If that bitch started right in the mud, she'd have run better. Have you got nerves? No. I just like a little privacy. You know, they say if you got nerves and you're taking a piss, think of your multiplication tables. Works wonders. Occupies the head. You'll be pissing like Niagara Falls in no time. You ever been to Niagara Falls, Jamie? God! Where's me fucking money? I don't know. Shut up. Shut up. Don't fucking lie to me now. Where's me credit from Tommy? He's been crowing all over town about his win. You didn't expect his fucking dog to win, did you? Uncle Tom. You took your friend's money, which is my fucking money. I don't know. I lost it. You lost it? You fucking lost it? Are you running bets behind me back? Do you think there's a fucking train pulled in here? No. Who runs the dogs here, you or me, huh? You or me? Do you?No. That's right. You don't. All right. That's enough. Two weeks. Call on Tom tomorrow. Tell him he's got two weeks as well. I'm feeling generous. Two weeks, right? One of you fuckers is lying. Either you come up with it, or he does. Two weeks.

Uh, no, no, no. I don't have a ticket. It's a blue sweater, you see. But I don't think the package will be blue, not on the outside. It might very well be a typical brown paper parcel.

I don't know if this whole thing is such a good idea. Why? Well... I don't know. How are we going to sell them all? Watch me. What if nobody wants them? Well... we have the only magazines in Ireland with pictures of naked girls, so someone will probably want them. Yeah, but... You've just got to say the right thing, Pete. I don't know. It's illegal. So is jerking off. So is underage drinking. So is killing Aunt Mary. Lots of things are illegal, Pete. Yeah. Okay. Here. Donal. He's our first. Maybe he'll take it for £2.00.

I'm going to Tom's anyway. Oh, you are, are ya? Well, I don't know what you think you're doing going over near that old drunk. He's nothing but a drunk. He's always sitting in the pub drinking. I get it. He's a drunk. Well, it's true. He is a drunk. And I hate to inform you now, but Annie Forker across the way... You know Annie? She told me what happened to him there last night. That woman never told a word of a lie. What did she say? Got himself beat up something fierce, he did. Oh, alcohol. Probably mouthing off to some young one. A man his age living on the dole and drinking and gambling. I don't know. Tom? Tom. Go away. Go away, James. Go away. You know, we're never leaving here. Ever. Aw, Jesus Christ. You must be the worst drinker in Ireland. Better improve because you're going to be here for a while. James. Hello. I'm proud of you. You again? You're doing well. Yeah? You're almost there. Trust me. Who are you? Every time I listen to you, I get my ass kicked, or Tom gets his ass kicked. You're just a figment of my sexy imagination. So you had a little setback. You're stronger than that. I know it. That's your American spirit, James. Don't worry about Tom. He loves you. He'll forgive you. Everything will even out. But you... you're not even with everyone else. Not by a long shot. So here's to your success. Your success, your success... Keep going, James. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Bill didn't give a shit where I got the money for him, as long as I got the money for him. All was forgiven but not forgotten. After that, it was back to work, and back to business. Hello. Mr. Burwa? Hi, it's James. James Powers. Yeah. Yeah, it's going well. Of course they're in demand. I don't find that surprising. Come on, let's go. The Irish... this tiny population on this incidental isle stand tall. Leviathans of the written word. Amazing but true. Every meditation and narrative style, modern and post-modern taught were born and raised here on this rock from these simple people. And most of it... the best of it, really... at one time or another was banned, illegal, amoral, filthy. Dubliners, The Picture of Dorian Gray, the works of George Bernard Shaw, the poems of Oscar Wilde, and now... Royal Slappers, Diamond Diddies, and Backdoor Birds. 18. Now I want you to take these to Paddy's in Rath Droma. He's going to give you 60 for it. And remember, only give them to him if he's alone. The ones I have marked are gonna go to... Oi. Oi what? Why only give it to him if he's alone? Well, I was going to buy a store front in Grafton Street and sell them out of a window display, but then I decided I preferred it the old-fashioned way... you know, I'd urge you guys on our bicycles. It's illegal. Now, lads. Off you go. Happy Hour didn't bring in new customers. Charley had another idea. ♪♪ What? We need more. You know, after paying for the magazines and delivery and everything else... We've sold a magazine to practically every kid in town. They want more. Mm-hmm. Sure do. They don't have more, though. They're broke. We've got a couple of hundred pounds so far. It's crap. Yeah. Half of them want to buy on credit. Credit. Someone offers me another bike as collateral. We have to branch out. I don't know. I mean, it's not right. All right. Who said anything about right? Do you want out? No. Not out. I'm thinking big, you know. Expansion. If s... If some kid's going to jerk off for £5.00 to a naked chick, what's a middle-aged mick who's been banging the same wife for 15 years going to pay? Like Mom used to say... might as well be killed for a lamb as a sheep. Or sheep as a lamb or something like that. I don't know what she meant. Well, she wasn't talking about naked magazines. You with me or no? Do you remember anything Dad ever said? No. This is ketchup. What I am going to show you... is... The risk... you got to take it for the profit I'm making. I see... the candy and gum... and all I see here is crap. It's the future of... of leisure. It's the future of Ireland. And you know what? It's your future. You look like someone who's trying to improve his lot in life. I look around your store, and I see the typical papers and magazines, candy, and gum. But I also see profits. I see risk taker. Because you got to be a risk taker to be a profit maker. But a smart kind of risk, you know? Pure capitalism. For it is that which made Ireland the great country it is today. You know, uh, but what's going to distinguish you from the... from the seller down the road? What's going to make Joe Blow come... come here Instead of Charley Menokes? I notice he's doing quite well, by the way. Had the Irish Weekly sold out by Wednesday. And all I'm seeing here is your typical garden variety magazines. I don't sell no garden magazines. Well, what I'm going to show you is... You're the Yank who sells the naked pictures. No. Well, yes. But... Hold on now, son. I'm not peddling your filthy shit for you. But please, just... just give me a min... I can't condone such filth. It's fucking disgusting. Now get the hell out of me store. May God have mercy on you. You're a sick, sick boy. Your profits will be 200%. James. The stranger, the orphan, the American, was becoming the great emancipator. Although it might have been coincidental, I was changing Ireland, Like Michael Collins or that guy from Tin Lizzie. You know, maybe the Irish heroes are no different. Maybe they didn't really care about changing Ireland as much as they did about making their own life better. But people were changing. Fathers and sons now shared more in common. Many took a keener interest in religion. And burnt-out flames of passion were once again lit. It was perfect. What is it, Easter fucking Sunday? Hey, fellas. On the house as usual. Check out Page 36 in that one. Oh, they'll all get equal time, they will. What the fuck is that? That boat's fecking ridiculous. It's newer than the old one. Bigger, too. Scare the feck out of the fish. Maybe. It's got a motor. Hmm. Make plenty of noise. It's big, all right. takes up half me feckin' yard. I can take it back if you want. Ah, no. No, no, no, no. Seeing as it's here, you might as well leave it there. Might as well. Hi. Hi. I'm James. Hi, James. And you're Fiona. I know. Um, so homework. Uh, what do you study in school? Um, everything. It's school, you know? This is just for fun. Yeah. I read, too, for fun. I see. Is the truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife? I haven't got that far. It's on Page 1. Oh. Okay. Um... bye. Would you have dinner with me? Sorry? Would you have dinner with me? Dinner? Um, okay. At your house? Constipated. A heathen and a barbarian. No. Um... how about the movies? Everyone likes movies. I like movies. Well, great, then. Um, so... Saturday? Bye, James. ♪ She says wake up ♪ It's no use pretending ♪ I'll keep stealing ♪ Breathing her ♪ Birds are leaving ♪ Over autumn's ending ♪ One of us will die inside these arms ♪ ♪ Eyes wide open ♪ Naked as we came ♪ One will spread our ashes ♪ Around the yard Shh, shh, shh. Hold on a second, Bill. Watch this. Any second now. Ah. Ah, look at that. It's always the wee ones want the fight. Mickey. Stupid mutt. Come on, come on. Bugler, put... put... All right.Good fellow. Listen, I want you boys to keep a lookout for them girlie magazines around. It's probably some tinker coming in from Scotland or something. Oh, geez, Bill, he's bleeding pretty bad. Ah, poor little fella. Take care of him out the back there, Billy, will you? I thought they were coming in from Dublin, but Paeden told me no. What? The magazines. These? Will you look at the tits on that slapper? Holy mother of God. Is that what you're reading? God forbid it be the Holy Bible. Don't get base. Where the fuck did you get that? Keep your hair on. It's Harrison's, above the Killarney Road. He's had it for ages. But I did hear a shipment came in from the north. I heard London. Uh, Jimmy, I'm not going to beat around the bush. As you know, you and I have something very close. After all, we are the last of the Haskells. Oh, is that very serious? It is to me. I want to keep the name of Haskell in the health food business. Well, I understand how you feel, Uncle Charlie. I want to keep the name of Haskell in the music business. I'm talking about big business. Can't you understand? I need you, Jimmy. Some day you're going to get... How are you doing? ...everything I've got. But you're not going to get it if you persist in triggering... Well, Peter, it seems the whole world is looking for your brother. I like it here. My dad was happy here. Oh, I could never understand my brother. And I told him when he opened this place He'd never make a go of it. Wouldn't it be great if you knew the next words you spoke would be the last words you ever said to somebody? It would surely be more interesting than "I'm going to the toilet." Okay. So what did he have when he died? Biggest funeral this town ever saw. Everybody was there. Is that so? Since when has making money been a crime? Oh, I'm not going to argue with you. I'm not going to let myself be upset. Hey, Paeden. Here to sell me your filth? Oh, you hand it over, little fucker. Jesus Christ. Dollars, dollars, dollars. That's what this is about. It's a waste, you know. You're a smart fucking kid. Real smart fucking kid, figuring this out. If you came to me partners, I'd have given you 20%. Now nothing. It's over, boy. It's over. Must be 6,000 here. Why the fuck didn't you leave? I don't know. He's always trying to make it to America. You made out like a bandit here. You're lucky you're poor and not dead. What's going on? We've got to go. What? He took our fucking money. Who? Now! Aren't we? Where are we going? This is it, Pete. We're leaving. Tom? He's still outside. You hungry? When Bill figures it out, it'll be tomorrow. And when he can't find us, he'll head straight for Shannon. So we won't be there. Now eat your dinner. Must be Tom. Fuck. You stupid little fucker. You really thought you could get away with it, eh? We'll let the sharks have a go at you. I don't want to fucking do this. I don't want to fucking do this. Why did you want to be an American? You're fucking Irish, lad. Listen to yourself, for fuck's sake. Listen to yourself. Listen to yourself. Listen to yourself! Why did you drag your poor fucking brother into it? You selfish fuck. He doesn't even want to go. That's what he told O'Hara. He wants to stay here. In Ireland. Tell him, boy. Is that true? Let him go. Don't fucking talk to me. Let me think this out. James? "Jamess." "James-s-th." He sounds like Porky fucking Pig. Daffy Duck, you fucker. Fuck off. All right, let him go. No, just the little one. Not a word out of you. Go. It's just bullshit. They're... They're just trying to scare me. What he said, it's not true. Just go. Go! All right, let's... Aah! No! Come here. Don't go near the trains or the docks. There's guards looking for you. You know what you have to do. No! Look, I'll be fine. No. I'm not leaving you here. The secret is to keep breathing, you see. I'll be fine. The guards will be here in a minute. So go. Go from here. Try and be a good boy, will you? Now feck off! Go! Go, you little fecker. Go! All of that over a few naked pictures. It's been a long while now. Sometimes I try to remember what it's like back there, but memories distort everything. They're... They're subjective and cruel. Still, I can't help but wonder if things turn out for the better or the worse. Most likely, they're the same. It's odd, but I don't worry so much about Pete anymore. I finally figured out he's smarter than me. He'll be okay. And once in a while, I think of Fiona. None of that matters because I made it... America, the land of the free, home of the brave, all that. I can't just leave all that I started here. Things are happening. And it would be too hard anyways, especially with a rap sheet like mine... trafficking, gambling, theft, burglary, murder. It's probably better to think I'm dead. Can't go back to Ireland. But, you know, I might like to one day.
