Sunny day, blissful day, hopeful heart, the motor running Laughing goal, laughing start and a beautiful drive Passed Rome and Madrid, a trio reeling through life Over the sea, over the land we came to realise That a friend, a good friend Is the best thing in the world. A friend's always faithful Even if the whole world collapses So don't get upset If your sweetheart no longer loves you A friend, a good friend Is the best thing that there is Here we are at home again. Do you see that? No one here to open up for us. - No wonder, we've come unannounced. - And were gone 3 months. You can't expect the servants to be ready. - Pet, where is he? - There he is. Where's the dreadful bird? - What's to eat? - Betty, where are you? No one here. What's that? Look over here. What is it? - It looks like a cuckoo. - What's that? - A bailiff's seal? - A bailiff's seal? How did that get here? We're in a nice mess. Come here. You are reminded of the auction of all your distrained furniture. - It will be fetched on June 18. - At eleven in the morning. June 18, that's today. And it's eleven o'clock now. Someone's made a silly joke. I don't think this joke is much to laugh about. - Who are you calling? - Our lawyer. Dr. Kalmus' office here. Helbing. Can I speak to Dr. Kalmus? Dr. Kalmus. Who's there? Here's Helbing. The three mad musketeers are back. Hello! Hello! Miss Mondschein, what do we do now? Break it gently. Break it gently... - Pardon, who's there? - Helbing. Tell me what's going on? What a good lawyer... ...if our home's distrained whilst we're away? You should've prevented it. With a few words I can... You had our instructions... But for God's sake... Stop a minute, please. - Don't shout at me. - No more of your cheek! - You can't beat that! - I won't put up with this. It's a misunderstanding. I don't mean you. Hang it, be quiet now! - Did he hurt you? - Shouting at me! Something very unpleasant has happened in the meantime. Something unpleasant? What? Give it to me. Something very unpleasant? What? An earthquake? Change of government in Lippe-Detmold? Or perhaps your wife's had a blond baby? Be sensible. What... even worse. Gentlemen, may I have your kind attention. - To break it gently, you're bankrupt. - Bankrupt? Yes, bankrupt. B for beggar, A for ancient debts... ...N for never paid, K for kept... ...R for really penniless, U for utterly poor... ...P for poverty, and T for... touch wood. There's a lot of money in our bank account. - That's what you think. - We only have to ring up. You won't get through. There are cells were your banker is... ...but not phone-boxes. - Cells? - Cells? Yes, C like credit difficulties, E like a mess... ...two I's like imprisoned for life. Imprisoned? Your money's gone. We don't own a penny? Are completely broke? Broke isn't the word. Stone broke. If I may spell it for you... B for... And the same to you. It seems to be out of order. Cuckoo It calls from the wilds Dear good Bailiff Go away You won't find anything here The call comes from the wilds lt'll soon be time for us to stop wearing dinner jackets Oh, how shall we feel. We must forget about playing polo, eating oysters Oh, how it hurts. We had goods and money, and thousand things Now the beautiful life's over Instead of whiskey only lemonade Instead of caviar, marmelade Good God, we're bankrupt Cuckoo Cuckoo It calls from the woods Dear good Bailiff Go away You'll find nothing here Cuckoo Cuckoo It calls back from the woods Here we are Take a firm hold Use your muscles Then we'll manage Look, my seal's stuck here on each piece You can see it at a glance The vulture's bondsman. Dear Augustin Everything, everything's gone. Good-bye, dear couch Who knows, when I'll see you again Good-bye dear silver cabinet, I'll remember you all my life They're taking the carpet as well Who knows who'll walk on it They only leave the walls standing And we, we have to go on the dol Sweet doing nothing, doing as we please, we'll have to change Fortune's angry with us Money alone doesn't make you happy But as soon as you've got no money you become nervous We only saw work from afar And even from afar it didn't look nice Back! What does that mean? Oh God, he wants to bite me Get out! We're going Dear good Bailiff Go away, you won't find anything here Now it's up to us The car's the only thing he didn't take. What do we know? Work. What have we learned to do? Tennis. Dancing. Driving. Something must happen. - What's wrong? - Not a drop of petrol. Then we must fill up. - But where? - Where? - We'll see. There isn't a petrol station far and wide. Unbelievable on such a busy road where hundreds of cars drive past daily. Our future's ensured. We'll get rid of our car... ...and set up a petrol station here with the money. And we'll call the petrol station "Cuckoo". Sunny world, blissful world, joined us together for ever Love dies, love blows away, friendship alone remains Yes, you forget your kisses because fidelity's old-fashioned Yes, we betrayed many a woman, but we stick together A friend, a good friend Is the best thing in the world A friend remains a friend Even when the whole world collapses So don't be upset If your sweetheart no longer loves you. A friend, a good friend Is the greatest treasure there is Well and now to work. How have we done? Isn't it beautiful? Slim as a bayadere. You can fatten yourself up as well. Children... ...our first customer. Pay attention, now, now, now. Here come our first earnings. - Good day, sir. - What can I do for you? - What would you like? - What can I do for you? Air. Yes, the air's good here, we've got fantastic air. In the tyres! He's an idiot. Anything else? - Water. - Pardon? Water. - My God, he's thirsty. - Water for the radiator. An idiot. Can't we give you some petrol? Yes, a little. But I'd like to say you'll break my neck. He even laughs, the stupid boy. - Is the tank here or there? - There. - Then put some in. - Of course. Enough. Was the gentleman satisfied with my water? - OK. - Have a good journey. The air was for me. Another one. Is there another one? Ten pfennigs? Ten pfennigs. Our own earnings. Hello Willy, get up! It's seven o'clock. You must get up. Me? Why me? You must go to the petrol station. Hans will be back any moment. You must get up. Today you're on duty. Yesterday I cooked and tidied up and Hans the day before. This three shift system makes me sick. - You can never lie in. - I can. Even when you're so tired after eight hours... ...working at the petrol station. Quick, hurry, breakfast. Hurry, quick, get up. Hans needs his bed. - Quiet, I want to eat. - Enjoy your meal. - Help! Murderer! Robber! Police! - Shut up! Be quiet! - You. - Please rock me a bit more. How about that! I was sleeping so well. I hope you're not too angry with me for disturbing you. It's great. What can I do for you? Guess. I guess. I've got it! Petrol or oil. You're brilliant. What do you say now? Great. I'd like 2 litres of oil if you can spare some. I can. 2 litres of oil for you anytime. One moment. Straight away. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - What's that? - For our regulars. - Nice. Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Great. Great... Yes, that's enough for today. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK Brilliant... great. Damned beast! Now the beast's running. Here's the tea. - Milk. - Sorry, I forgot. Miserable service. Here's the milk. Marmelade. Here's your marmelade. My toast! Old pig. Who's in there? Doesn't it taste good? When I think of how we ate breakfast three months ago. You've no reason to complain. The petrol station's doing well. - The coffee's bad. - We've got a nice house. - The milk's burnt. - And even bought a car. Don't exaggerate. Look what a row it makes. It's a slow-combustion stove. Move - petrol station. What? - A sip. - Out of the question. - Give it to me. Give it. - Go to work. - What am I? Your dog? - No, you're lazy. - Does it taste good? - Wonderful. I made it. - What can I do for you? - 30 litres of petrol. And five litres of oil. Straight away. - What can I do for you? - Water for the radiator. - What can I do for you? - 20 litres of petrol. 50 litres of petrol. A can of oil. To drive a car, drive a car Is the greatest weakness of every little woman And all young girls dream Today of a driving licence Super cars, classy cars, with a sweet girl in it And a sky of blue Who wouldn't want to be her partner And many a man calls out: Hello, you sweet lady Don't drive alone, you could steer wrongly And pass by happiness Why, my sweetheart? I need all the room for myself Take me with you, I know the way there and back If the right man's at the wheel He'll lead you to adventure Hello, you sweet lady, don't drive alone, take me along I know the way to paradise Why, my dear one Do you need all the room for yourself? Take me with you, I'll find the way there and back Hello, you super woman, don't drive alone, take me with you I know the way to paradise We forgot that! If in spring you don't drive in company We'll be lonely in the nicest car Hello, you sweet lady, don't drive alone Take me with you, I know the way to paradise Yes, Dr. Lutter? I'd like to speak to Consul Cossmann. The Consul's busy. - Hello, miss! - Yes? - The Consul mustn't be disturbed. - Then that's it. I can't put you through to the Consul, he's got an urgent discussion. I told you that the Consul's engaged. You know exactly that the wedding doesn't depend on me. You'd have been my wife for ages... ...if my daughter weren't so strict with me. - Have you spoken to her at all? - What an idea?! - Then I'll speak to her. - But Edith... Good day, Mops. I've asked you a thousand times not to call me Mops. But Mop suits you. I'm pleased to meet you at last. Your father told me so much about you. He told me less about you. You've come just right. I was telling your father... ...that I'd like to speak to you in private. That's not at all necessary. You can go into the conference room in the meantime. - Go, march, march. - But Lilian, but Edith... Here, so you don't get bored, Mopsi. - Well. - Thanks, I'll be brief. Miss Lilian, I'd like to ask you for your father's hand. Madam, you do us an honour but I regret to have to inform you... ...that my father's temperament requires a firm hand... ...which you unfortunately don't have. I must, therefore, keep him under my control for now. I knew it. I knew it! You can come back in again. But you can't... Give me 200 marks instead and don't talk so much. Why 200 marks again? I must go to the cinema and buy myself cigarettes. - Well in that case... here. - Thanks. Good-bye, Mops. - A splendid girl. - Isn't she? If only she wouldn't call me Mops. Maestro. What's the matter? Why are you shining your lights on me? Sorry, I thought you were someone else. What can I do for you? There must be something wrong with my car. I filled up this afternoon, now the petrol's all gone. We'll soon have that. One moment. No wonder, you're driving without a petrol cap. So much for women drivers. I bet I can drive better than you. Possible. But now I'll get you a new petrol cap. Take your time, I'm not in a hurry. - That's too big. - You see everything. - This one's too small. - Then wrap something around it. - No, that would be a pity. - You can bring it back sometime. Yes, gladly. What are your working hours? If I'm not here give it to one of my colleagues. Are your colleagues all as nice as you? This doll is to remind you to keep your car in good shape. - What's that for? - For your trouble. I didn't mean to insult you. If you want to make amends tell me your phone number and name. You're quite mad. Oh, please, please. Lilian Cossmann, Breitenbach 1387. I know the way to paradise What have you got there? Oh, nothing. What are you mumbling about? Oh, nothing. Good evening, little one. What have you got there? Mops, I've met three charming young men... ...three friends and none of them knows that I know the others. You're a good one. You're so strict with me whereas you have... I've been thinking all evening which of the three is the nicest. Where are these people? I don't know. I've been waiting an hour. - I can't wait that long. - Stay, they must be here soon. - Why? - Can't you read? BACK IN A MOMENT - Give me the parcel. - No, it belongs to me. I want to see what you're doing with our hard-earned money. Pure silk, silk. Wraps himself in silk like an old geisha... ...so that he can please his secret love. Cheek. I don't ask who you bath in lavender for. You've got a smell that even a dog couldn't stand. I smell quite all right. I smell very nice. And who am I bathing for if you know it already? For this impossible person. What did you say? Lmpossible... Which impossible person? What sort of a girl would have anything to do with you? Better than the female that hangs a sardine tin round your neck. Where is it? Show me. What did you say, you ridiculous dwarf? Female? Help! Leave my friend alone. If you touch me, I'll spit at you. Willy, help! - What's the matter? - Nothing to do with you. What are you doing here? You should be at the petrol station. - Me? You! Or Hans - Me? Are you mad? I'm not going to get consumption and you laze about. - A filthy mess. - Don't be ridiculous. I'm not as ridiculous as you. Mysterious stranger. Have you introduced your girl to me? My girl's a lady who musn't be compromised. You're hiding her because you're afraid we'll take her away. Just wait! That's fine, just hit each other, I'll be the referee. Give him a hand, I've got to go to the petrol station. That's a mess. A mess! Now we'll break the door down! Damned awful weather! Lilian! You here? The storm took me by surprise. What a sight you are! The storm also took me by surprise. And besides, I had a bit of a fight. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? What else can I do when a lady dear to me is insulted? A lady dear to you? That's exaggerating. A friend, a casual friend. Tell me, Willy, if someone insulted me would you fight for me? - Of course - That's nice. I mean to say I'd do it for any other lady. You think you're irresistable, don't you? No, not irresistable, but clever enough... ...to realise that you're rude to me because... ...you're afraid of being as kind to me as you'd like to be. How do you know that I want to be kind to you? I hear it. There. Darling, my heart greets you Only with you alone Can it be happy All my sweet dreams Are wrapped in my greeting Don't let the days fly past Spring is nearly over Darling, my heart greets you And tells you how much I love you Still only sympathy entwines us We are still formal We've never kissed But in my dreams I use your first name And whisper softly to you... Darling, my heart greets you Only with you alone Can it be happy All my sweet dreams Are wrapped in the greeting Don't let the days fly past Spring is nearly over Darling, my heart greets you And tells you how much I love you Darling, my heart greets you And tells you... how much I love you An eye A black eye Is the worst thing in the world A cloth, a damp cloth Is always good if you hold it against it My child, do not be upset If there's no wedding A friend, a good friend Is the greatest treasure that there is Stop! I know the chorus, dear friend. It comes after every verse you utter. Edith, I'd like to... Lilian's come. Your strict guardian. Allow me? - Thank you, madam. - For the first time you're nice to me. You've picked a lucky day. A lucky day? I bet there's a man behind this. If only it were so simple! There are two men involved. - Two men? - To tell the truth three. With all respect! You must tell me about it. Come. Of course only one can seriously be considered. You must make your choice. You think so? You can deceive one man. You even have to. But three men together are as clever as one woman. Then I must tell the truth. - But diplomatically. - Diplomatically. Then the best thing is to write each one a letter. It's not as simple as that. Why? I'll just write: My dear Willy, I... Yes, what shall I write... ...so that he doesn't misunderstand? I... I never thought it'd be so difficult... ...to write letters diplomatically telling the truth. I told you so. Objectively a letter Can be very awkward Many a person looks at it and reads behind the lines Be careful how you do it So that it's understood What you mean By each line First a large question mark Which means: When will you give in? Then comes... A dash Which means: Darling, I love you Then from time to time whilst kissing You'll have to put in a comma And finally a full-stop Which means: Leave me alone No, I can't do it like that. I'd better tell all three. That won't be easy, I don't want to hurt any of them. Then we'll anesthetize patient beforehand. - How? - With champagne. Tell all three to come to the Gigepfel at 10 tomorrow evening. There they'll all see that they're in love with the same girl. You're clever and charming, pity I didn't know that before. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK Where are you going? I've got a date. You too? That's... very good. What's going on? Is this a fashion show? We've got a date. And the petrol station? One of you is on duty. Would you like to take over for me? - I've got a date. - Leave me alone. Would you like take over my duty? I've got a date. Why should I? Besides, with your permission... ...I also have something special on this evening. Well, one of you has to go to the petrol station. Why me? Why always me? It's a cheek if no one does one a favour. What cheek! I know. We'll draw lots for who's on duty. Yes, but without me. I wouldn't dream of it. What then? Yes, why not draw lots? Willy, don't be a spoilsport. What for? Why? - Go on. - Well, I don't mind. Here are three bits a paper. There's a nought on one. Whoever draws the nought's on duty. - Willy, you start. - Good, I'll start. My God, the nought. The nought. Bad luck. - Poor chap. - Shall we go? Oh, go to the devil. We pulled a fast one on him. We did a good job. Well, where exactly is your rendezvous? - Oh, I've completely forgotten. - Well, well. And you, where's your rendezvous? I've completely forgotten. Quick, quick! It's urgent. Suspicious scoundrel! These rascals! Nice, isn't it? I'm a bit afraid. - A drink'll give you courage. - Yes, you're right. Tell me, what have you been whispering about all evening? - Nothing for small children. - And nothing for large Mops. Give me a drink. Yes, right away. There they are. Now. - Gin, please. - A cherry cola, please. - That's fantastic. - Yes, that worked. Cognac. Cocktail. Now, my friend, you'll see how pretty my girl is. - Cheers. - Cheers. Yours won't even exist when you see mine. We'll see. - Shall we bet that mine's prettier? - You're crazy. Good evening, gentlemen. May I introduce... I've won my bet. She's my rendezvous. Yours? She's mine. Lilian, please tell this incorrigible bragger with whom you've got a date. Yes, please, tell this notorious boaster... Yes, gentlemen, I'll explain everything to you, but... ...for the moment I've got a date with each of you. With both of us? - With both of us? - Not so loud! I must say... - Look, Hans... - No, I'm not interested. - Please, Kurt, I can... - I'd rather do without. I never thought much of you, you fool, but to be so mean! If I'd known with whom I was hand in glove... ...living under one and the same roof... Don't be so angry, it's all my fault. - You lied to us. - And betrayed us. - Played with us. - Leered from one to the other. - Laughed at us. - Made us look ridiculous. She's also got a rendezvous with Willy. I'd credit the lady with anything. In your place I'd be ashamed. In you place I'd behave myself decently. Him as well?! May I take you to your table? You dressed yourself in silk for that! And you bathed in lavender. A cognac, a large one. Soda, a lot. That was nice of you. Lilian, child, where have you been so long? Papa, I'd like to introduce Mr. Willy Helbing, my Papa. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - My pleasure. I've got several things to say. Mops, before he speaks to you, you have to know... ...that he's the nicest young man that I know. Well, young friend? Don't be offended, Consul... ...your family affairs are no concern of mine... ...but I'd advise you to bring up your daughter better. You needn't give up hope that she'll become a useful person one day. At the moment she's a heartless, superficial, coquettish, spoilt brat. Good evening, Consul. Bravo! He's put you in your place. By Jove! That'd be a son-in-law for me. Come. Willy's coming. Look, it's Willy. Here he comes. Look, Willy! Well, where's your heart's desire? Yes, where's your darling? You should be ashamed. You fools. Are you putting up with his? Filthy dog. A friend A good friend Is the greatest treasure that there is Oh, he's a nice fellow. You got me into this. You with your diplomacy. But Lilian... It's all your fault. Yes, now I know. Yes. When you have only one daughter, you take care of her... ...and don't let her flirt with three men at the same time. - Three? Why three men? - Oh, that's my affair. I don't understand. - What kind of advice did you give her? - That's my affair. - Will you pay so that we can go? - Pay, that's my affair... But children... Darling, my heart greets you It can only be happy with you alone All my sweet dreams Are wrapped in the greeting Darling, my heart greets you And tells you how much I love you. SHUT FOR SALE Well... Please... Good day, miss, it's good of you to come to me... ...I didn't have time, after the recess there's a lot to do. Consul, please be seated. Ladies and gentlemen, I herewith open today's meeting. - You can leave. - Me? Why me? - Because it's a private matter. - I'm your private secretary. You were if you don't go at once and close the door. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, I open today's meeting. For the second time? Which has been called to discuss the arrangements... ...which shall lead to a marriage... ...between Miss Lilian Cossmann and the one hand - charming - ...and Willy Helbing on the other. - I beg to speak. - Please. FOR RENT You're decent and fall in love with one woman... ...and such a little beast falls in love with three men. You live unaware with two people you took for your friends... ...who turn out to be rascals with whom it's impossible to live. - Then we all agree. - That's it. - Each of us goes his own way. - Exactly my opinion. Come in. Good day. Do the three men from the garage live here? I've brought a lady here who'd like to speak to the gentlemen. A lady? - I'm not in. - Nothing doing. - I very much regret... - That would make me very sorry. Good day, gentlemen. Jacket, jacket, where's my... It's my pleasure to meet Willy Helbing... No, dear stranger. Edith von Turoff. I'm pleased to meet you. - Can you spare me 5 minutes? - In what matter? I'd like to speak to you in private. - Pity. - Yes, I'd like to have listened. Will you please be seated? I've often admired your efficiency at the garage. There's a plan to found a garage company... ...for which they are looking for a competent director. I'm sorry, you must look for another director. Why? I intend to leave Berlin for good. IT'S MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE If I accept your offer, then only on one condition. That you engage my two colleagues with me. Your condition's accepted. Gentlemen, you'll hear from me again today. - Good-bye. - Good-bye, madam. Many thanks, madam. - It was delightful. - Yes, it was very nice. You two fools, I thought we were angry. - We'd almost forgotten that. - Yes, really. If we're going to get on together promise me one thing. The name of the girl who almost tore us apart will never be mentioned. - Good, agreed. - Word of honour. Word of honour. Shut up, we're working here... ...this is the directors' office of Kutag, Kuckuck Tank AG. Never be gloomy THE LOVELY LILIANA COSSMANN WITH HER CLASSY SPORTS CAR!

One moment, please. I very much regret that the general manager is not available. The entire management is... Be quiet! Let me do it! I wanted to say the manager is at a conference. But I've got full authority, with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? Pardon? The telephone exchange? What do you want, miss? You only wanted to hear if the phone works? You can see that, hear it. Am I a crackling? Damn it, take the thing away, it's absurd, say, it's ridiculous. That's... Don't get upset, it's just the fire department. Come in. A young lady's here. What kind of young lady? Oh, our money lender's prot?g?e. - Oh, from Frau von Turoff. - Who? The secretary she recommended to us. Let her wait. - Have you gone mad? - She'll tell Turoff everything.

I'm your new secretary. - Out of the question. - Pardon? The job's already taken. But Willy... ...she's our money lenders prot?g?e. Don't you see that this is all a conspiracy. - I'll not be a part of it. - Willy, go on. Go on... Do you believe that the vamp seriously intends to work here? Mistake. The vamp seriously intends to work. - That's what she came here for. - Can you type at all? Naturally. Please, I'm here, sit there. - Please be seated. - Are you comfortable? - Don't be afraid. - It'll be all right. Please, convince yourself. I'm curious about that. First comes a large question mark Which means how can I soften you up? Then a dash Which means: My sweetheart, I love you Then from time to time whilst kissing You have to put in a small comma And finally a full stop Which means: Leave me alone So, and now to you, miss. Yes, sir. Better than I thought. It's of no use. Write another letter. Yes, sir. - Are you ready? - Go ahead. To the board of directors of Kutag. Since the company was founded under other conditions... Other conditions?

I give notice as of today. And resign from the board of Kutag. Have you got that? ...and resign as of today from the board of Kutag. And perhaps you'll add: Yours faithfully? Yes, as you like. And respectfully? I find that very polite. So, and now, sir, just your signature, please. Put it down. Is there anything else? No, Thanks. What were you doing in there? Willy, be sensible!

You're only interested In being a married woman... I've had enough of this, thanks, I can do without. - Bravo! - It calls from the wilds Take another husband Look at me closely I've had enough I've had enough, I'm not a dog You tormented me for 20 years, I said yes to everything Whatever happened was my fault, now I've lost my patience - I say no and no again - Don't shout! - I want to shout! - Consul, this is too much!
