I'm asking you a question! - No mama! - You gave your heart to Jesus when you were nine years old. Now look at you. - Mom I do love Jesus. But I'm not nine years old anymore. I go to work and I'm a grown woman. And I'm living my life for me, Jodie Lynn Palmer, that's who I'm living my life for. (Lucille crying) And I love Kyle. I love Kyle and he loves me mama. And that's not a sin. That's something very special mom and your just gonna have to understand that. Do you understand? (screams) Kyle. - Hm? - Kyle I gotta talk to ya. - Go ahead I'm listening. - Well put down the magazine. Come on are you gonna put down the magazine so I can talk to ya? - Okay, go ahead. - I got accepted as an airline stewardess. - What's that supposed to mean? - Well they want me. To come to Los Angeles for training. I mean California's a terrific place for you too babe. I mean they got a lot of high payin' jobs and with your skills you won't have any trouble at all. - I ain't gonna leave Texas never. Neither are you. - Kyle now you just take a look out that window right there. That ain't Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday walkin' down the street anymore. That's Coldwell Banker and Exxon and Kentucky Fried Chicken and there ain't hardly anything left of Texas anymore. - What's the matter with you Jodie? You want to leave me? You don't love me anymore? - Oh Kyle. Kyle you know I love you. And it's because I love you I want us to get out of here. 'Cause we got our whole lives ahead of us and if we stay we're just gonna rot that's all I just want you to understand babe. - Suppose I went to Waco and worked for my brother. Well that'd be a step Kyle but I don't want you to do anything that'll make ya unhappy and then, that's just... - Ah screw it I'll give him a call. Now that we got that settled let's go celebrate. - Kyle I'm not going to the Stallion tonight. - Jodie you done got your period or what? - Kyle I just don't wanna go, I'd rather stay here and read or somethin'. - Honest to god Jodie I don't know what your problem is. I think you been reading that Ms. Magazine too much. - Kyle I'm not going to the Stallion anymore. - Well I am. - [Jodie] Well fine then go. - I will.

Listen why don't you go on home and get some sleep I'm gonna stay here. - No. I wanna stay with you. (engine running) - [Mr. Bridges] You're late. Where's that other jack off? - [Kyle] He ain't coming in. - [Mr. Bridges] Get to work. (machine whirring) - Add more zinc here! - [Kyle] Hey what did Applebee say? - [Mr. Bridges] Get back to work. - [Kyle] I'm wondering about my promotion, when am I gonna get it? - [Mr. Bridges] You're not! - [Kyle] Why not? - [Mr. Bridges] 'Cause I don't like ya that's why. Now get back to work. (smashing) Gah! Richardson you're fired! - [Nurse] Don't be too long. No more than five minutes. - Hey corndog. - Go away. - Ha. Well I'm sure gonna have a hell of a time wheeling you in and out of that old honky tonk. Hey the doctors say that you're gonna be all right in a couple months. The worse that can happen to ya is you're gonna have some kind of limp. - For the rest of my life? - Well hell all cowboys limp. - Get out of here Kyle, go on. Leave me alone. (door shuts) - You know in Texas one in 14 people live in a mobile home. A new built house in Texas will cost you all kinds of money. But you can purchase a manufactured home like this one here for $36,000 dollars. A mobile home is the answer. - What about property tax who pays for them? - Property tax? Well I suppose sir that would depend on the size of your home and the amount of property that you have. But you can rent a lot in Chapperelle Village for only $25 a month and that way when you move you can take your home with ya. - [Woman] We's just lookin'. - My name is Kyle. We'll even throw in a welcome mat with your initials on it. - Initials? - Initials, wonderful yeah. - [Kyle] Yes a mobile home is the answer. (moaning) (knocking) - Yeah, come on in. - Hope I'm not interrupting anything. - No darling. - Kyle's out front. - Yeah I know. I wanted to come in and talk to you for a minute if I could. - Well, come on in. - Thanks. - How you doing darling. You look pretty. Take that jacket for ya? - [Jodie] Yeah. - Beautiful hair. - Oh thank you. - Sit down there now. Make yourself comfortable. You wanna drink? - Uh, turkey coke will be fine. - Alright, turkey and coke. You got it. Is that your usual? - Oh well, sometimes you know, yep. - I tell ya I used to drink it then I'd wake up in the morning walking sideway like a damn spider so I switched. (Jodie chuckles) You want some ice in there. - Yeah a couple pieces please. - Alright. It's a nice surprise. Now tell me what can I do you for? - Well I come to talk about Kyle. - Yeah, well what about him? - Well Royce, you know what I really think Kyle needs is just to move to another state. - Whoa whoa nelly. I'll tell you one thing and that ain't two. That there ain't no other state but Texas. - Oh (lightly laughs) I know that. But I just don't think he's gonna be too happy selling these mobile homes. It's just not... - He probably won't be. He'll probably hate it. What's the difference? We all hate it. My salesmen hate it, I hate it. It's a whore's game and you're in it for the pay. - But all this time you been tellin' Kyle to come on into business with you. Why? Just so he can be as unhappy as you are? - Yeah, why not? - 'Cause he's your brother and you supposed to love him. - Let me tell you something darling. Kyle's a big boy. And Kyle can take care of himself. Your number one worry is Jodie. You take care of Jodie. - Yeah well Jodie can take care of herself too. - Now I'm sure she can. I bet she can just about get anything she wants. - You know Roy, you know you got a real nice wife now. - [Royce] I know that. - Yeah, and three fine kids I really like 'em. - [Royce] I love 'em. - No I do like 'em - I love 'em. - but I came here - Come here, come here, come here. - to talk about Kyle. - I know, come here. - So I'm, no I'm, - come here, come here, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me now. - Come on Royce now this isn't - Kyle is a fuck up, - come on this isn't funny, it's not. - He'll always be a fuck up. - It's not funny and you.. Let me go! (screaming) Royce for gods sakes. - Just come on, come on. - (screams) No! (screaming) (rustling) Oh god stop it! (crying) Stop! No! (whimpering) (crying) (Royce yells) Please stop! - Damn you. Little bitch! - Kyle no, it's not what you think Kyle. - How the hell are ya, you sell anything yet?
