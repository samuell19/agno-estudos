Cindy is coming! Cindy... How come? More security guards than audience? But this will help you become top singer. Cindy, you're so pretty. It's the happiest day today as the to-be hottest singer, Cindy... is coming for a close contact with you. You can take out your CDs Five? Are you then selling them for a higher price? No, as this is your fifth year in your singing career. Will you buy ten CDs if it is my tenth year? Sure, am I good? Yes. I've listened to this CD. You've made improvement, especially the second track. Terrific. Have I? I've signed on them. I have a new pager, page me if you have time. Okay, thanks. Page me if you have time. Cindy! What do you want me to write? Hey! Send someone to help! Don't run! Stop! I recognize, you're fans of Ada. Send someone to help, quick! Stop take photos, help me take it away. Cindy, are you very afraid? Cindy, it's alright, don't be afraid... How do you feel? Please tell us. Cindy, are you very frightened? Cindy... Do us a favour, it'll be too bad to post those photos. Of course... of course not. Nuts! Why do all this? It's really too much! How is it? Nothing. Nothing? You say nothing, but you fear insects most. Right, Johnson, we should cancel the activity. The booking time is over soon. Let me rest 5 minutes, I'll go out then. Okay, 5 minutes... You still go out? Maybe lions and tigers are waiting for you outside. Foster Mother, I don't want my first contact with fans to be spoiled. This will turn down the only 30 fans waiting outside. I'm your manager, we have a contract for 8 years. You still have 3 year contract on. I won't let you do anything that will affect you, no way. Listen to Foster Mother, this is for your good sake. Please get me a taxi. Okay... get a taxi, let's cast the fans away. I needn't show up for the celebrating banquet tomorrow night. Why? Now the autograph activity is cancelled my CDs cannot be sold, why have a banquet? What do you want then? I want to go out. Cindy! Cindy! We want Cindy... Will there be spiders? No spiders... Are there flies? No flies. No flies. No flies... Are there cicadas? No cicadas. No cicadas... Not a single one? No. Not a single one. No cicadas? No cicadas. No cicadas? No cicadas. Fans, let's applause. And welcome our idol, Cindy. Dangerous! Don't go there. It's very dangerous. Don't kill it... I give you one last chance, don't force me. I'll shoot! Action! Be careful of this pig! Siu, help pull the pig up. Okay. What an annoying pig! It only feared guns. Officers, let the Fish and Agricultural Department handle it. You don't usually have to work that hard. No way, as I am the Chief of the village. I take this as a practice. To defeat others, I must first defeat myself. Wah, are you okay? I'm fine, I got caught by the stick. Be careful. Chief, have soft drink. Hard job, rub the sweat. Thanks... No thanks. Siu! Take this pig home for Aunt Chut, be careful. What dishes today? Salted fish with mince pork, steamed rib with black bean. Pig colon, pig skin, stewed pig knuckle... and also pig blood, pig tongue. All from pig? Right, Aunt Chut is gratitude for your helping here. So she killed it and send us this. I helped her in vain? This is Aunt Chut's gratitude. Mom, I have something to tell you. What is it? Being Chief of this village... I've been policeman for quite a while, leading stable life. I'm becoming aged. In fact, I am thinking... It's time you marry your cousin... No, a transfer to the urban area... No way! I've said many times, you must be a cop in this village. As we can be taken care by us here. If you go away and something happens to you... How can I face ancestors? How can I face your father? Right, cousin, we can't be eased off. No. I haven't finished yet. I was trying to say: A transfer to the urban area is a silly idea. I won't ever want that. I want to start my career with my present resource. This is right, good son... Lai Su-kan, you're leaving? Coming. Great! Good skill, it's fit for hard cores. Sure? This is for you. Thanks. Aunt, sorry to disturb you. Didn't you say you're hungry? Yes, I did. Eat then! Mom, boss and I are doing some smuggling business. You know, it's so boring to be policeman. But smuggling makes big money and achievement. It's better than raising pigs, do you agree? Kan is smart, Aunt, you're lucky to have him. Eat it up, don't snatch! Mom, boss takes good care of me, I'll make a fortune. Inform your supervisor, smuggling is illegal. My supervisor is a member too, it's very safe. I fear dying too. Mom, what are you doing? Aunt, what are you doing? Don't come over! What do you mean? I want you to promise me. Promise you what? I want you to be transferred to urban area now. I won't let you stick with scoundrels and whores. I won't let you become smuggler. Aunt... Mom, but you ask me to accompany you here. Promise me! If you don't promise, me and Siu will die in front of you! Okay... I promise you. Hey, was it natural enough? Very, good acting. I fear I'd spoil things, I don't act as well as Yan. Yan is a good actor, he's a member in drama club. Isn't it good to stay in rural area, why choose to work in urban? You have to start from the beginning. I find you very silly. Silly if it is, but I'm still young, or you want me to do it when I'm old? Good morning, Sir! Sergeant Lai Su-kan, I've gone through your file. Do you want to challenge risk? Yes, Sir! Right, I want you to protect a very important person. This person often attend public occasions. So it's a bit dangerous protecting this person. It's surely a risky mission. Officer, I applied to be transferred to the urban just to hope to have new challenges. I can always take up whatever risky, dangerous mission. Good! You're to... protect her! What? Protecting a singer? What singer? Cinderella is becoming superstar. You're to disguise as her assistant, and protect her secretly. You mean I'll become her servant? Officer, no, I used to be Chief of my village for ages. Don't worry, it's urban area, no one will recognize you. No, Sir, I've been served by women. I don't know how to server them, it's hard job. But you said you like risky mission. I've asked you first, so now you can't back out. Come in. Right, let me introduce. This is Johnson, manager of Cinderella. Lai Su-kan! It's me! Do you recognize me? I'm Ho Bau-dan, I used to sit next you in college. Ho Bau-dan. Inspector Lai will protect Cinderella. Good, I can feel eased with someone I know here. I rely on you this time. Cindy is my niece, you must do your best to protect her. Yes, Sir! I'm in good luck this time. When I reported the case to police, your supervisor was reading your file. I recognized you instantly, it's really destiny. I don't believe in destiny. You must believe in it. I thought no policeman will take up this mission. Imagine, he has to work like a servant. He has to be ordered about. He has to work 24 hours a day, no family life... Hey... are you alright? Nothing, just so much? No, you still have to pretend you're a gay. What? Pretend to be a gay? Don't be like this, put this on? I tell you, I won't put this on! No, Cindy is very clever. She'll know if you aren't smart enough. Let her know, I'm not a thief. Man, find a policewomen, don't make me disguise as a gay. She thinks girls are emotional, and always slack. So we never hire girls here. Forget it then. Lai Su-kan, listen. In front of you is the best manager in HK. I've never misjudged people. I'm sure Cindy will be the top singer this year. She'll become very, very popular and hot! What's that got go to do with me? Of course it's got to do with you. Do you know where you are now? HK... SAR. No, you're in show business... and the front line in show business. You'll have chance to get in touch the best people in this field. This dream life of ordinary people can only be described as... exciting! Exciting? It's the thing you're after. How exciting is it? As exciting as you can figure out. Really? Yes, be good, put on this nose ring first. Can I do without this? Then... put it on the ear. I'll help you... very nice. Look how horrible this is. "Though can't be born on the same day, we must die on the same day. " And this one too, only "I love you. " I think this is blood. I guess it was done by people in the same field. Don't guess, I'll investigate. I make it clear, you mustn't have dream in Cindy. This kind of greedy, cocky girl, I have no interest in you. Cut! Shing, no, you must fix up that girl. Who's mamasan of this girl, ask her to snap her on the face. You snap her on the face, beat her! Hey, you really snap her on the face? You won't? I'll do it. I fear she refuses if I snap her on the face. What now? I can't finish the shooting today. I'd rather finish it today... Start rolling, come on. Start rolling... at your position... Action! Cut! Okay! Yeah! This shot is so hard. Aunt, Auntie, I am thirsty. Get me some water. Please get me some water. Quick. Quick, I'm thirsty. Cindy, what did you tell the girl just then? She's crying hard. Yeah... Just learn it from Shing... not good. Can I really? I don't believe, you are serious? Don't be scared if I tell you the truth. I'll try once. Will you cry now? I'll snap on your face if you won't cry, spike your navel. It's immoral How can you do this? Yeah, she's only 2 years old. I'm very small too. Why it takes so long for a glass of water? Let me do it... I'm thirsty. I'm very thirsty Quick! Did Cindy do this to scare you? No, Sister Cindy asked me just then... what I shall do if I wake up and don't see mother. I thought for a while and started crying. Here comes the water... Thinks, Brother Shing. Hey, don't drink it! What's wrong with you? There's delivery, do you want honey cress? Yes, thanks. Smart. I'll introduce, new colleague, George. Please do a favour, thank. Hello... Hello, it's hard job. I can manage. Welcome to our "Mistresses House". Good, let's cheers. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Hey, why don't you drink? You won't give me face? Come on, drink! Come on, cheers, bottom up? Good! Cheers! You can call me Aunt. I set up image for Cindy. I'm Auntie, I set up dance and am her body guard. We all take her as our own daughter. We've spent all our efforts on her. Say no more, give me a kiss now. Wait till there's no one around. Don't fool him, he's a new hand here. Let's kiss when no one around, I wait for you, don't fool me. Who are you? Jelly, it's you? Take your hands away, we know each other. Don't be afraid, it's going to be alright. It's late, is there anything? You promise you'll page me, but you never do. I come to remind you, I fear you'll forget. Tomorrow, I'll page you tomorrow. I know you're very busy. It's late, go home now. Go home or you'll miss the last bus. I'll wait for you... Okay, goodbye, take care... Who is he? Jelly, her first fans, so far. But he seems to be a bit nuts. He's cute and lovely. He's not nuts. He's my die hard fans, he know all my songs. Hey, are you my fans too? Yes, I love you songs too. Do you? Which song do you love best? I love every song of you. How did you join this field? You only a assistant, don't you afraid to be laugh by others. Show business is really glamorous. I can see many movie stars. The greatest thing is that I needn't work very hard. Eating well and slacking makes your fat and fat... Nuts! What did he say? I want to teach him a lesson. His jokes are not funny at all. Kidding... just kidding only. Don't you want to play here? Of course not. Don't think you come to watch movies stars here, you have to work hard. No, of course not. Are you a gay? Of course not. He's not born to be a gay, he becomes a gay only recently. I am... turned to be a gay. Is it like the photocopier? We're gay, so you're gay too? Oh! I see. Auntie, why stop here? Someone selling pirated CDs there. Aunt, Auntie, quick! $100 for three. Don't run! Stop! Don't run! Stop running! I... I didn't kill someone, I just sell pirated CDs. Officer, give me a chance. It's your hard luck to run into me, go to the station! I hate people who sell pirated CDs most. Right, he hates people selling pirated CDs. He's your fans. Sure, he hates your pirated CDs most. Really? Have you seen pirated CDs of mine? Sure. No. No, Cinderella... I'm your fans, how come I sell pirated CDs of you. I have never pirated your CDs. Really, Ada... Ada, still Ada. Here it is! Ken Choi? You pirated Ken Choi's CDs, shit! Cindy, I'm your fans, give me your autograph. Damn you! You have such ugly hairstyle and sell pirated CDs? Arrest him, he's rubbish! I'm your fans, you arrest your fans? What fans? You don't pirate my popular CD? What do you mean? Do you know how to do business? Why you only selling Ada's CDs? You deserve it, so many CDs not selling out, you'll be lost. You must be heavily fined or go to jail. No... don't send me to jail, I don't want to die. You said you've seen my pirated CDs, where? In Sha Tau Kwok and Yuen Long. So far away, no one will buy them. So we have market in New Territories. They're appearing in Tai Po, and soon landing in Kowloon. Let's talk in crowded area next time, or she'll feel heart-broken. How heart-broken? Yeah, she's very heart-broken. George, can you sleep in the sofa tonight? Yes. Foster mother, what happened to him? Nothing, his boyfriends has just dumped him. He wants to stay in this house for a while. You bastard! Why you rush in when I'm taking bath. I hear some noise, I didn't know someone was here, sorry. You peeping at me while I'm taking bath, you must compensate to me. What? You want me to compensate you? Hey, is it mistaken? Does he know the rules? He's been irritated, he misses his boyfriend so much. So... Aunt. I can answer the phone next time, no one will call for you here. Hey, George, come over here... I don't seem to get on well with her. Will this affect your investigation? You needn't worry, I'm expert in that. Foster mother. What is it? Are you alright? Help me take this. Why so troublesome? Sit down, let me take it. Just then little girl failed to cry out. I knelt for 2 hours, I'm so tired now. Poor, come on, let me massage you. Is it comfortable? Aunt called and asked if this hairstyle is nice. No, too old and exaggerating. Isn't it good? Only aged women have this hairstyle. I'll ask George. George. Yes. Do you like this hairstyle? Good, it's hairstyle for college students. I have no idea what you are talking about. Nothing now, sorry to bother, thanks. He... he's very interesting. Except innocent and naive, I cannot think of other words to describe him. But he can work very well, really. Man, you say he's good? He's smart at catching hawkers, but no taste. No, he has... some real skills. He's good as massaging. What did you say? Why not jump into the chance and impress her, come on. Come on. You'll admit it's excellent skill. Come on. Is it very comfortable? Just like ant bite, no strength at all. I fear I'll hurt you if I massage hard. Do you? I don't know, go ahead. Hey, Billy B Video, it's new. Come and look. George, can you lower yourself? Or kneel down, if you don't mind? What? Want me to kneel to you? What problem is there? No problem. If you don't want to, you needn't do it. Okay. Sorry, no problem. No need, I used to rub it myself if I make a wound. Sorry, didn't I say sorry to you already? Let me help you, okay? Watch MTV, okay? Okay, good. You're awake? Why don't you sleep more, nuts! Were you very tired? You didn't wake though I tried hard. Sorry. Foster Mother, which one? What do you mean? Tie on the neck. Which one is good? That one... You put on the tie with this? This is "Goldion". I've asked you not to wear suit. Which one is good? I'll ask someone else, thanks. George, which one do you think is good? Green means environment, stripes are not. The green is brand-label too... choose the green one then. This one? Good, thanks. Hurry up, wait for you. No need. We have enough help, anyway. In fact, I'm really helpful. Right, he works really hard. If you want to see movies stars. There's other jobs for you. Right, I'm not against you, but this job doesn't suit you at all. You don't have other skills either. Yes, I have, I know massaging. He's popular in clubs. What then? Don't waste time anymore. Don't waste our time, this field doesn't suit you. Right? Let's go. Go back to the clubs. No, let's watch on. Why, foster Mother, you keep standing by him? Send him away, if you don't have some special reason. Go away. I can't help. Let me. Okay... Let me tell the truth. In fact... In fact, George is my girlfriend. Therefore... all this. Pay at once... You've guessed again. You've won again. I've told you, they always exchange regards. But they are good couple. You needn't keep it secret. They're a good couple. Shit, time's up, let's go... I must revenge for this. We all work for a living, I might let you take benefit. Shit! Go to hell! Quick... Quick... Where's she? Over there. Why are you so late? It's mango. Yes. Evil, there's a haunted mango tree in Garden Road, they say. It's not strange, there're 2 other in Prince Edward Road and Oxford Road. More pomegranate trees there. Why you know so much? I once worked in Fish And Agricultural Department. Where's you going? Why don't we pick a few and eat? No, they aren't ripe yet. Pick them and let them grow a few days. Hey... Work first, stop that temper. I'll come and pick them with you when we finish work. Really? Come on. What time is the duty roster? You're late so much? Now that Director scolded me so hard. Sorry, I'll come right away, sorry... Come late? Don't take yourself as super star. What do you mean by this? Forget it... It's trivial matter. We've waited for half a day, how long must we wait on? What? If you aren't use to waiting you don't do it. Shit! Must I beat you, you bad! Come if you want a fight, come. We're used to waiting... Don't be fussy with these silly guys. They scared me much. Sit down. I really want to beat him. He has glasses on, so don't... Don't be angry. Are you hungry? A little bit. Want to eat something? Sure. BBQ pork here is famous, want to try? BBQ pork rice. What for you? Coffee, little sugar. Sure. Please step aside. Delivery is being late. What are you doing? Nothing. What are you hiding? Nothing. Jelly, show that to me, or I'll report police. Don't report to police... I haven't done anything, don't report to police. I won't report to police. Come on... I'll show you, but you must give it back to me. Okay. Just then Cindy gave me autograph, I picked it up on the ground. Hiding this hair? Why are you running so fast? Give it back to me. Can I go now? Go. Cindy, they say you're giving mini concerts soon, is it true? Go away. Why are you so naughty? Foster Mother, what is it? Last time we asked him not to post the spiders photos. But that Froggy posted it as cover page. Ada... let's take some photos. Ada, this way... Ada has the same clothes as Cindy. Cindy, please have photos with Ada. Come, so many people are here. Ask her first, no problem with me. But maybe others will mind. I don't mind. That salesperson is unreliable. Tell you what, there's only one in Hong Kong. Your new song is not bad. You're lucky, you picked that now. You've been lucky for so long, should be my turn now. Thanks... What's wrong? Nothing, they want you to change clothes, this will do good to both of us. You're ordering us, aren't you? What did you say to him? I didn't answer. What? If you don't answer, it means you promise him. No, I won't change, what's wrong with the same clothes? I didn't answer him, I just stared at him 48 times. Show him your grimace. Very professional, you deserve to be number one manager. Bad guy, too much... Chu Kim Mui, The run-down is changed, now the last part. How come? When was it changed? I don't know, you ask the Director. Hey, Shirley, what are you still waiting for? Why all this? We're just wearing the same clothes. Don't be angry, Baby. People notice you as you're a singer, not your clothes, okay? I think alike, so I'm not going to change clothes. Where did you buy them? Seem not to be from "Hong Kau". Sure, look at the paper bag. Watch out! Sorry. Why are you so careless? I saw him splashed intentionally. Hey, mind what you say. Compensate for it, this dress is expensive. Of course a compensation. Sorry, I'm so sorry. How are you, are you alright? What do you want? Foster Mother, I'd better not go out. I'll suffer if I go out. It's fine. Cindy, listen to me... good. Foster Mother... Listen to me. I've tried so hard, but just in vain. It's so hard for me. Do you know how far you're away from success? Just this much, just this. But you give up for this little incident? Is it worth? We've been working so hard for you. Look, everyone is working so hard for you. So just sing with your heart. They come to hear you sing, not look at your clothes. But they will look at it. Then sing better, and make them pay attention to your singing. Right. Don't we have spare clothes? In the car. Yes. I'm the best manager in HK. I have never told a lie. I said I'd make you famous, you'll be the most popular singer. Really? Really. I want to be real most popular. I guarantee with my love. Rub the tears away. Yeah, rub it. If reporters see your tears, they'll make up stories again. Remember... I get gold disc last year. Just two drops of tears... and the caption reads: Too happy or sad for the past life? That reporter is too bad. Not as worse as last time. Remember at a charity show, you wore red and black. He said it suited you, meaning you're never famous. There's even a worse time. Your name is Cindy Chu, and that reporter said... it suited you, and old-fashioned name with the old-fashioned you. It's too bad. Work hard, get up. Don't admit failure in front of others. We all rely on you. Work hard. Work hard, hot singer, Cindy Chu! Cindy, work hard, you can make it. Cindy, work hard. Don't give up. Can you help me get my spare clothes, quick, and my high-heeled shoes too, would you? Sure, of course. Wait! Sorry. Are you mistaken? Hey, cousin! Siu, why are you here? Me and Aunt come to see the show, how come you're here? I come for the show too. Aren't you protecting Chief Executive? I'm protecting Chief Executive... Then why are you here? Chief Executive comes here too. Comes here? Right. Why does he come here? He comes to sing. Really? Yes. He can singing? I never know he is a singer. He... sings badly, so he has no CD. Chief Executive wears high-heeled shoes? Right... He's gone. Bring me inside, I want his autograph. Of course not. Sign here... OK, give it to me, goodbye. I'll wait for you here. Okay. Cindy, I brought the clothes here. Cindy, standby, 2 minutes more, hurry! The trouble can only be solved by the stirrer. I have an idea, I wonder if it works. If you fail, we will fire you. I must succeed. Cindy! The response seems good. I didn't expect she wears George's jacket... and patched dress, but the audience like it. You are like the song. Give me your autograph, please. Siu. Chief Executive's autograph. I'm lucky to have Tung's autograph today. And also take photo with Ada. Ada? Right, she sit in front of us. What's wrong? The audience responses very well. Hey... look. Foster Mother, you're too cruel. The stained clothes are still useful. She's dressed like those housewives, she'll appear on papers tomorrow. I didn't do this, none of my business. It's you. Sorry, I made up this idea. I forgot to kiss you, I kiss you now. Foster Mother, help me. You can just buy it cheaply, why risk to pick them? The one we pick will taste better. It's the real fruit after hard work. Auntie, Aunt, help me. Mind if you'll break your bones. No, I'll be careful. Still higher. Don't risk. Be careful. Let me do it. Shit, you should tell me earlier you are a good climber. Right. Take it. Your "girlfriend" is cute. Right, he keeps climbing up and down, he can work well. Hey, this way. I want some too. Remember, this one is mine. They're really good, let it ripe for one day, and we can eat them. No, at least let them ripe for a week. OK, one for each of us, no snatching. Who will be responsible for this? Of course I will be. No. You are to guard this. Okay. Hey, we aren't so familiar with him. Can we trust him by letting him guard such precious items? Why? I'm very familiar with him. Hey, where are you going? We're going for a bath home. What is it? It hurts? No, just a bit tired. Let me massage for you. Don't you fear when you climb such a tall tree? Very tall? Yes. Nothing, I only think about eating mangoes, and nothing else. You're too much... It's... You will do anything to do what you want. No, but I must win. Must win? When I was small, I always tried to get 100 marks. Even in difficult subjects, Social Studies, etc., I'd always learn them by heart, very by heart. But after I left school, I found everything different. The more I want to be perfect, the more I find it impossible. I just don't know what I should do to be perfect. It's really hard. You understand? Of course I do, for the resolution... I've suffered so much. Man, you'll break your bones. We'd better sit down, let me help you. You help me? Sure! Wow, great! Can I? Yes, not as bad as Siu. Who is Siu? Siu... is my ex... the one I dumped... Why do you join this field? Is it because you love someone? Who? Foster Mother, of course. Yes... I want to fulfil my resolution, my ideal. What resolution? To be a singer. Really? Yes. You'd better admit failure. I was just joking, in fact... you're nice, as you're tall and handsome. It's different in this field, we talk about relationship. You're not smart at this. You blink when you lie, I can tell you have relation with Foster Mother. You're like my mother, you both say I'm bad at telling lies. Does she? People say pretty women have sixth sense. I'm pretty smart at tell lies. Bullshit! Beat it! Let me ask you one thing. What is it? Will you be angry? Go ahead, busy-body. How come you're not that greedy, cocky girl in my imagination? You really want to know? Yes. Because... I am a very, very greedy... and very cocky girl. Really? This is my first gold disc. Do you know, to get a gold disc... my CDs must be sold by more than 25,000 copies. I sing so hard, then finally... I managed to sell out 800, not even 1,000. How come you got a gold disc? I was frustrated, I once wanted to give up. Why must I sing so hard? Why for? I sing so well but no one appreciated that. I sang for years. Those people said I'm just a common singer, not the top ones. You know I am so miserable. Then a guy came to me and said... Not because no one like you, but because you don't sing well enough. So you must work harder. If you sing harder, people will like you then. So he made this fake gold disc for me. Who is he? Foster Mother. Don't be mislead by their fat appearance and madness. They all have their resolution. Want some massage? Want me to massage your back? It hurts! Don't move, the more it hurts, the better it is. You always massage like this? No, this is the first time, is it comfortable? The first time so comfortable? Let me make you comfortable. No... no... Let me step on your back? No... No, thanks. Face the ground... No... Don't insult me... no... Why, you've been standing here a long time? About 1 week. I thought you're bored, so I come to play with you. No need now, you have a good time massaging. Come on, let's dismiss. No, Aunt, Auntie, let's play together. Let's play together. You don't play? I'm very happy today. You're very happy. If I am in good term with her, I can investigate easily. Come and play, busy-body. Stop! The shape is not fit enough. Thanks. You are still not up to it. Have some water. Bad guy, you become expert. Of course. Let's kiss. Alright, when there is fewer people. You said that, when nobody is around. Who is it? This is Sunny, he always help Ada for her dancing. HK number one dance director, he's excellent. How did we dance, Auntie? Not bad. Not bad. Cindy... let me introduce you. This is Sunny. Hi. Sunny? We've met before. Sunny has helped a lot this time. He is helping us to arrange all dances in the mini concert. Really? Thank you! I always want to co-operate with you, but no chance before. You always help Ada for her dancing. Our co-operation has been too long, I feel bored. She can't even do this posture. So I want to change working environment. How do you feel? You've watched for a long time. Not too long. How's my movement? Auntie is our people, don't be afraid. Our people, right, Auntie? I find the ending of last part dynamic, open it up. Bend foot. Right. Right, much better. What about this... Sunny, help me take care of Cindy's rehearsal from now on. It's not good, Sunny is very busy. It's fine with me. Really? I'll change clothes. Foster Mother, you see, it's great! Fast response, very fast! Good partners brings good results. You're great, where did you find him? You forget I am the best... manager in HK. 5, 6, 7, 8 2, 3, 4 What's wrong with you? Nothing, never mind me. Don't go... come pick me up. Really much more professional than Auntie. Even profession shouldn't hold so tight. Cindy, have some water. No, thanks. Have some water. No, thank you. Hey, what time is it? Are you alright? Why so scared? Nothing... I'll answer paging first. Siu, what is it? I find someone like you next to Cindy in the paper. You made a mistake. It's sure? No, I've read several papers. It looks like you. Don't bullshit. Have you wooed other girls? Come on, I have something to tell you... You're bad, you have another... You still deny? Listen to my explanation. Explanation what? No need, explain to Foster Mother then. This is my job. Don't be embarrassed, get me some water. Is Cindy okay? What do you mean? I mean she being a woman. I've got her already. Supple skin, soft waist... good for squeeze. Is she? Yeah. Hey, mind what you say. None of your business, you bitch! Sunny... do me a favour, listen to my explanation. What's the use of explanation? No... Shit! George, you beat him and now he's gone. You beat him? You peasant, you're too much! You know I've made much efforts, I've paid so much money... to invite Sunny to help Cindy in her dance. You now beat him away? Do you know who you are? Don't look at me, think about your identity. Foster Mother, don't be mad. Just listen to his explanation. I also want to know why he beat Sunny. Okay, say. He insulted you. What? He said you... have soft waist... supple skin and great figures. Sorry, I was so rash. You made up such thing, you lied! What I said is true. You think I'm blind, I saw everything. You beat Sunny as you're jealous of him. Are you? Say! You want to woo Cindy? Hey, we must clear this case. I'm a very fair person. I won't ever have love affairs with my staff. Say, do you want to woo me? Say, do you want to woo her? Say... Tell us! Say! Do you want to woo me? Do you want to woo her? Okay! I'll say. I... I won't woo you, as I am gay. I don't love women. I love you. I don't believe. What must I do to make you believe? Prove it to me, kiss with me. Cheer Foster Mother up, now. Come, kiss, come on... turn around. You will do this when you're back in the room. OK You promised me you won't woo Cindy. I don't want to woo her. I'll kill you. I've said I'm not wooing her. A little dinner is okay, why such a square meal? I'm happy as you come out with me. I was not going to come. But I'm really moved by you. You find out finally that I love you? How much? Very much, I love you very much, I'm not kidding. Prove it to me. I can do whatever you ask me to. Will you die for me? I was only kidding, come on. Let's drink. Who is it? Cheers! Sorry, I'll open the door, be back soon. CID! Are you Jelly? Sergeant Lai, the report is here. Is it blood on the letter? Same type as Jelly's, type O. But at the moment, we can't arrest him for a DNA test. Okay, was it written by the same person? Very probable, 70%. The 30% was not? Absolutely, Sergeant, you're smart. Sorry to bother you. Don't go, don't... I'm sorry... Stop the sorry, you must convince Auntie now. Auntie said he's leaving. What is it? Where are you going? Foster Mother has found Sunny to help her, no one needs me now. George, right after the press conference... please give this resignation letter to Cindy. Good! Sunny has promised... I've said much to convince him. Can we tell the reporters later? Sure, but we must hurry, come on. Yeah. Cindy, what is your plan? I'll be holding my mini concert next month. Your first concert? Yes. Anything special? Besides new songs, we want some breakthrough in the dance. Who is in charge of the dance? Is it Sunny? In fact, this time, we... Of course not. Sunny and Ada just then held press conference to extend their contract for 1 year. Then who is it? Cindy, please tell us... Just then the reporters made me dumb, like a mad woman. Sunny really promised me for that. Look, the entire contract is here. Has he signed? He said he would. He signed with Ada! We've set up the contract, we can't help now he backed out. He's eaten his words, he made use of us for better terms with Ada! Don't shout, any of you just apologize. Okay? It's my mistake. No, it's my mistake. I'm useless, I'm dummy, okay? Shit! He's really angry. Foster Mother, what do you mean? I was only joking. Frankly speaking, I find myself a failure. Don't be so serious, you make us all afraid. I've worked with you for 5 years, I know you very well. Cindy, let me tell you frankly... If you had a real good manager, you'd be superstar already. I have one already, it's you. No, I'm not... Foster Mother, we asked Sunny back just for a trick. We never expected we could rely on him. About dancing. Auntie is real expert. Forget to tell you, the five of us here are like a Super Pentagon. The five of us are like the fingers in one hand, we're an integral. You're the best manager in HK, we'll be over without you. I'm not the best, not the best. I must make you the best if you're not yet. Trust, I have good sense for that. You must become popular. Really? The most popular. I can hold too? Great. Auntie, I rely on you for the concert. Don't worry. We rely on you... Auntie has a letter for you. Why doesn't he give it to me in person? Don't give it to her. What are you doing? Thanks Auntie, my first birthday card ever. But isn't it a bit early? It's 1 week in advance, no signature either? Right, let's all sign on it. Sign on it, come on... Thanks. George come, sign it. Hold it, I think we should give George a position. Let's invite him into our "Mistress House". We are then a family. Good! I... I'm not like a milk mother. No, let's call you Big Aunt... Hold it, Milk Mother, you're Milk Mother. Milk Mother! We have nothing to do, why don't you see a movie with Foster Mother? They go to see gay movie, it's not my cup of tea. Not your cup of tea? No way. I don't like western movies. Right, I have a new song, with only melody. There's no content, nothing. Do you have any feel on it, or maybe any idea for the lyrics? I don't know this. Just because you're fresh, listen to it. Come on, try. Just close your eyes. Close your eyes and see if you have feeling on this melody. Just the first feeling, any feeling will do. It seems to tell about a boy who falls in love with a girl. He is mistaken with her at first. But he loves her finally. Because of some reasons... they cannot live together. It's not a happy ending I do want a happy ending, but I can't help. Why so sad? Is this your own story? No... You still deny thinking of Siu. No, stop joking. What do you think the MTV be about? There should be a pond, pool, hills and a wood. It's hard to find, there's only buildings in HK. No, I have many of them at home. Where do you live? Sheung Shui, Two Piece Field Village. Two Piece Field village? Right. The name of the village is cute. Right, as you're from there, you might be the leading character too. Funny, a love story in a village. I... I can't. Casting... How to? Just say you love me very much. But not with words, but with your heart. I'll make a face, being helpless, with reasons... and can't accept you. Okay? Ready... I haven't said action, why act so soon? This is a basic act, you can make it. I can't... No, you were great, your eyebrows acted too. What if we exchange position? I'll act I love you, but you must show some reasons rejecting me. Okay. Let's begin. Let's start. No, I can't. The one showing you love me not enough is great. This is not to good. Your act showing you love me is a bit reluctant. Is it? Right. OK, let's concentrate, and do it once more. Okay, give me your hand. Cindy, I really want to tell you, in fact, I... You mustn't talk, we're shooting MTV. I love it, this is a perfect expression. Very good. Really? Cindy... It's a waste as you don't date girls. It's a waste as you're a gay. I'll go to washroom. Why must you bully me? You nuts! Su-kan... You come to investigate, don't stir up things. I'll get you a towel. What is it? I don't know why a mad woman splashed at me suddenly. Why are you all wet? I... a maddie splashed water at me. Where? I don't know. You scare me. It's bloody. When did this letter arrive? This morning, very horrible. Time to go for interview in radio. Let's go. Come and play, why hide yourself? We'll go to disco after the interview. I want to eat mangoes at home. It's ripe? It's ripe enough? Milk Mother said 1 week, it's exactly 1 week today. I'll get them, let's eat them at the radio station. You want it? Yes... I'll go with Auntie. Turn left. We aren't turning right to get mangoes at home? We picked the mangoes at the wrong time, they can never be eaten. Let's buy some from the store. It's late, all shops are close. I know, I'll just try. Today is her birthday, I don't want to let her down, let's go. Okay. Turn left, watch the car. It's tasty. Really tasty? What's special with this mango? It makes a fair lady lose etiquette? I picked this mango myself in the crowded Central. In the crowded Central? Yes. Shit! How come there are mango trees in urban? Strange, my mandom Milk Mother picked it for me. My birthday this year is meaningful. Who is the mandom Milk Mother? A new member of our "Mistress House". If not giving her face, I would drop out at once. She must be too happy, she only mentioned you, and not us. A new "girlfriend" will surely be pampered. Okay, time for the last call tonight, hello. Cindy, Happy Birthday to you! Thanks. What's your name? Who am I? I am your husband! Don't you recognize me? Why don't you believe me? Right, did you dial the wrong number? Cindy, I've written so many letters to you. Why you never reply? Cindy, you answer me. Good, thank you for your calling. Let's listen to a new song. What call is it? It's horrible. No idea, frustrating. Time's almost up, let's go. Wait, don't go. The operator didn't notice, it was made from the phone at the hall. Auntie must be held by the guy, it's bad, no one rescues him. I'll see about Auntie. Gee, you report to police. Yes. What shall we do? Watch Cindy carefully. Don't go, stay here. I'll be back at once. Who called just then? No idea, I was patrolling... Auntie... Auntie, how are you? What's on? I don't know, ask the security guard to help. Sure. Someone attacked me while I was waiting in the car. He even tied me up with cello tape. I saw a scar on his hand. Cindy, drink some water first. Can we leave now? Yes, you may. Officer, I suspect this call was made from the hall. Gee, can you get me the tape of the interview just then? Sure, I'll get it now. Thanks. Shall we have the letter of this morning checked? Why don't you tell me? I fear you'll be frightened, so I didn't tell you. How long has this happened? Tell Cindy everything now. It's unfair to lie to her now. Tell me. I am a police officer. Being chaperon is to disguise. Police officer? This has happened a long time. I fear you'll be in danger, so I invite him to protect you. You come to investigate? Yes. You're not gay? No. You're smart at telling lies. Cindy... Sergeant Lai, who do you think did all this? We are still checking. If you need my help, I'll be very willing to. We know each other so well. Okay. I was so sorry about last night. You know, I'm also confused as everything happens at the same time. But I'm just so common. After a quarrel, I'll forget all rival. Don't bear that in mind. Of course not. Come out, don't hide, we're not talking secret. Come out. My supervisor called me just now... saying my identity has been revealed. It's embarrassing to check on. Is it? No... Three of my colleagues will protect you. Must they pretend to be gay? I fear they are not up to it. You know, you pretend very well. Miss Chu, this is my job. You think it's good to disguise as a gay? Don't be hard at me. Me hard at you? Sergeant Lai, you lost temper before I do? Do you know how much I want to beat you? Okay, if you like, just beat me. Okay, you think I dare not beat you? No, don't be like this... Let her, let her say everything, go ahead. Okay, I want to ask you... do you know you hurt others by telling such lies? I don't know. You don't know? I tell you, it hurts so much. Being a policeman, must you do this? No, I mustn't. If you mustn't, why did you do that, why? Tell me. I can't control myself, I fell in love with you, okay? Damn it, it's faces on the ground. Collect faces... Collect faces, go... Cindy, in fact... Sergeant, Lai. Cindy, I'm leaving. You seem not to have finished just then. I have one thing for you. It's my gratitude, I hope you'll wear it 24 hours a day. Thanks. What noise is it? It's alarm, it sounds hard. It can help you when you're in danger. You have finished? Yes. Any supplement? Thanks, I won't see you out. Excuse me... Did you wrong anyone? Sorry... Please... Take a photo for me, please. One more. Still one more. Don't eat it. It's very sour, not like the ones of last time. What you ate on your birthday was bought by George, sure it's special. In order not to let you down... I went to all fruit stalls still open that night but I failed to get it. At last he thought of ordering room service in hotel and taking them away. Come out... Want something to eat? Ada, look at this side. Don't hurry, let's get a perfect photo, slowly. This way, right... Are the clothes in here? It's a look-thru dress. Cindy... Go and stop him at the hall. Cindy Jelly, what are you doing? Last time you asked me something, I've thought over. What? You asked me if I will die for you, just to prove I love you. I've really though over. If you inform me earlier... and give me time to get ready. It's not problem for me to die for you. Are you mistaken? I haven't asked you that. You don't believe me? I am serious. I've thought over, I really love you. I really want to live with you forever. I have to work. I have things to do, we can't stay together forever, nuts? I'm not nuts, why do you call me nuts? I'm not nuts, I am serious. Sorry... I didn't mean that. I... don't know what I am doing now. Let me see you out for a taxi. I have things up there, why don't you leave first? Goodbye... How is it? I've thought over, you are right. We can never live together forever. Goodbye. He's not down here, maybe he's getting up there. Where's Cindy? Okay, I have a way. What way? Easy, I am figuring it out. Hurry up! It's Foster Mother? Cindy, where are you? I want to remain quiet. You scared me to death, where are you now? I'm fine, don't worry. I... am going on a ride. Do you know where George is? He's so tall, he lives here. I don't know what you're taking about. Do you know... a policeman, he's so tall. Sure, I know him. Really, where is he? He's Chief of the village. No, he's very young. Yes... No, no... Miss, I'll take you to see him, Miss... No, thanks... Miss, I'll take you to see him... Miss... Where? Chief, a girl comes to see you. Where? Over there. Cindy, don't run... Cindy! How are you? Are you alright? I'm sorry, I come to see you, I didn't mean to kill you. Don't die, say something. I... Go ahead! Keep awake, I'll report to police. No need... I'm fine. This is duck blood, not my blood. You come all the way for me? You're happy as you teased me again? I didn't tease you, but I'm very happy. I've stressed on work since I joined this field. I have never fallen in love with anyone. But it's so hard... I'm impressed and happy too. Will it help, a girl like me come all the way to the New Territories? Yes, It'll help... I miss you so much too. So you left me when I was in the most critical moment? No, my supervisor ordered me to. I care so much about you indeed. I gave you an alarm, it's my gratitude. I bought this alarm myself. I don't want it, take it back! Cindy, I never read entertainment news before. Now I snatched it from my mom's hand every morning. I rush to buy all gossip magazines too, I want to find your photos. I go to buy photos with your autograph too. I even joined your fans club yesterday. Nuts, you're just nuts! You tease me? I tease you? But you scare me so much. I'm Chief of Village, don't take me as nuts. You're really Chief of Village? Yes. How much did you spend on these photos? Around $300. $300? Show them to me. Right, I've bought 3, with your autograph. Nuts, this is fake autograph, $300? They cheat even a policeman? Yes. Nuts... give me face, don't call me that. Come sit here. You know, these stolen fruits are especially sweet. You said so, just like picking mangoes. It's precious as we get them with our efforts. Why throw it me? Was I wrong? What's wrong? Very sour! Sour mangoes are tasty. Siu. Siu? Yes, she's my cousin, very shy. She's your cousin? Yes. Siu, what do you mean? It's too bad. Aunt, don't say this, I'm bringing trouble to you. You're welcome. I didn't expect you're so gentle. Am I? I didn't expect to see such an... old, big house either. I've never seen such houses, like those in old movies. Sho, come and kneel down. Yes... Mentor... Kneel down. Su-kan, see Miss Chu out. It's hard to walk as it's very dark. Outsiders are not used to it. Okay. Mom. Who is Su-kan? I'll called Lai Su-kan. You're Lai Su-kan. Yes. It's not good, like Cindy Chu. I find we're the perfect couple. You've promised me that, where is your room? Yes... Take them off now, busy-body, just like a woman. But you have promised me that. Only a while. Yes... take them off. So small? You promise you won't laugh at me. It doesn't suit your bulky body, man. I shouldn't have shown you. But these trousers are really small. My dad was very short. Sorry, I won't laugh. Don't be angry, with this on, you look like... Chief, very... I am a real Chief of Village. Don't be mad. How did you wound your hand? I got hit by a care when I was chasing you this afternoon. Is there lotion? Yes. Let me rub some for you. Sit down. I know now. I know why you lost temper when I asked you to kneel down. Don't mention those silly things. OK, is my mother furious? No, she's a ordinary mother. Invite Siu and your mom to my concert. But I may be on duty that evening. Dare you refuse to come? How are your legs? Still hurt. Here. It's new? Yes, I injured them during the rehearsal. Why so careless? Not at the rehearsal? How come there's bruise? Of course it's not at the rehearsal. I don't know when I injured it, it's old wound already. Why so careless? You rehearse so hard just for one concert. Don't you find it's a waste? I want to give 30 concerts, but I'm not up to it yet. Does it hurt? No, it doesn't. Say if it hurts. It hurts a little bit. Can you hold me like this, and don't move? Hold me like this forever? But I must be on duty tonight. I have to leave after dinner. Can you just pamper me, and tell lies to me? You said you don't like others to lie to you. So you won't come to my concert, but go on duty? I'll go and check tomorrow, if I'm not on duty, I'll surely come. Which is more important, me or your duty? Cindy! Cindy... I'll see you out. No! Su-kan, such a girl doesn't suit you. Cindy, I've thought of it. What have you thought of? So mysterious? I'll go away if you won't tell. No, don't. I've thought of how we can live together. Really? Tell me. Quick, you're bad. Let's die for love. We die for our love... isn't it romantic? Very romantic, but I get nervous. Me too. When I think we can be together forever... I'm really excited. Just one more week, and we can be together forever. I hope that day will come soon. Thanks, put it here. Stephen Chiau sent you this. Oh no. Does he want to woo me? Cindy! Cindy, hope your concert a success. This is Raymond. Director of Universe Records. I won't bother you, Thanks. See you at the party later. Please watch my performance outside. I'll see you out, Director, I'll see you out. Why? You are at a loss? You have stomach-ache? Relax, don't put pressure to yourself, OK? Sir, I'm worried about the security of this place. There're more than 1000 audience, we've never had this experience. I've talked to Chief of Security here. Bear, come over. Yes! He's an experienced Security Personnel. You needn't worry the least, with me here. Cindy, guess who has come? You will never guess. Cousin of Milk Mother. Hi! Hello! What is it? Cousin wish you every success of your concert. He apologizes, as he can't come. He's not a friend. There's a letter for you. I won't bother you, goodbye. I think we'd better go out first. No, stay and accompany me. Foster Mother, read it for me. I read. You read. No. You'd better read it to me, Foster Mother. You read. I fear I'll get too excited. Hold it! Read it, Foster Mother. I won't read it. Why not? You'd better sing with concentration. Cindy, don't scare us. We have all our efforts on you. Give a good performance first. We've waited for years just for today. OK. Foster Mother, keep this letter properly. I'll read after the concert. Auntie. Keep this letter well. Don't worry. Here comes Cindy... Cindy, do you think something would happen? The security system is good here. Cindy, look here... Cindy! Jelly? It's him, catch him. Stop, don't move. I recognized he's the kidnapper, there's a scar on his hand. Dare you stir up trouble in my place? Help! Go away... Say, why? I only want an exclusive interview, I didn't mean to harm Cindy. Sorry... Go to hell. Take it easy... Take it easy, do you hear? Take it easy... Sergeant, let us handle it. Thank you. Thanks for coming. You're welcome Don't you remember us? Yes, I do. Don't you say you won't come? I... thought I would never see you again. Just then I was patrolling and I saw something interesting. So I couldn't control myself, I kept leaping in the street. Just like a mad man. But I talked to myself, I must tell you... I must tell you... What must you tell me? Do you remember the guy who sold pirated CDs say? Cindy Chu latest CDs, three for $100. He's selling pirated CDs of yours. Does it sell good? That guy, bastard, he said it's selling madly. Great! Great, my pirated CDs at last. Hey... Hey what? Very nice! What very nice? This is a pirated CD. I want two. I want to tell you something. There's something I can't cheat myself. I love you. I finally have my own concert. Besides thanking for you support. I must also thank someone. A very special one. Now, I dedicate this song to him. I'm sorry. I once said I don't love Cindy. You can strangle me now as I throw my words. How come she sing to well now? The magic of love is wonderful. Why must I strangle now? I've never heard Cindy sing so well. Just for the sake of a guy. You... no power at this critical moment? In the pocket? Which pocket? Is it the pocket in the jacket? Jelly, you. Aunt, You're making-up again? It's so long. Aunt! Are you happy? Yeah! Are you delighted? Yeah! Do you feel good? Sorry, as something happens suddenly, our concert has to pause. What is happen? Jelly is here, I'm afraid he will hurt you. He broke my head, but I'm fine now. He has a knife. Come, let's leave from the back exit. Can't you just respect me? I'll regret all my life if I leave now. Which is more important, singing or your life? Singing. Don't be childish, stop singing, and leave now. Let me go and tell them, just tell them. Dangerous. I beg you. Cindy! Why don't sing on... Sit down... Cindy! What's happen, cousin? A maddie is here, and tries to harm Cindy. Though this is my very first concert. But it may be my last concert too. No way... Cindy! Though it's just Academic Hall here... but I feel like standing at HK Coliseum. Thanks for supporting me all these years. I know that. I'm very happy, on such a meaningful evening... you're here to share with me. But at this very moment, I do not want to leave the stage. Cindy, don't be rash. I'm not rash. Though some accident did occur just then... and maybe I can't finish the concert tonight, yet... I think I should at least sing this song. Just one song. No way. Cindy. It's okay? Yeah! Don't do anything silly. It's very dangerous. You'll be protecting me, right? Yeah! Cindy, don't strive for success, okay? I'm not striving for success, really. I fear nothing, as you're next to me... I want to sing on. Music, please. Yeah! I won't let you sing on, It's too dangerous. Get down. Quick. Listen to me, don't singing on. Just last one. Music. Thank you. It's only once. Cindy, we love to hear you singing, really... Cindy, we support you. Go on singing, you'll be alright. Cindy, stop crying, we stand by you. Cindy, stop crying, we stand by you, sing on. Stop! What are you doing? We found this dress in the toilet. Cindy, take care! Jelly maybe disguised himself as each other. Cindy. It's Jelly. Jelly? Cindy! Don't be afraid. Cindy, you go first, I'll come soon. Are you alright? Don't scare me. Are you alright? Getting luckier after surviving. Okay, nothing now... It's a good occasion in music field. The wedding couple... handsome groom, pretty bride. There?s two of a kind. Let's have the honour for them. Congratulations! Gold Manager, tell us how you met the bride. How I met the bride? Ask them to take photos here. No, they've found a quiet place for the contract. What? Contract? You're really signing me as singer? I don't have confidence. But anyway, you were once a chaperon. Why don't we make a couple singers? Sign it. Ten year contract? Will you tease me? You have no confidence in me or in Foster Mother? You mean it. I like you as you're straight enough. Take another mango home. You're addicted to them, I've said, sour mangoes are good. You are right, it's delicious.
