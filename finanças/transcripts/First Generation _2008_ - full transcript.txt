(priest chants in Sanskrit) (doorbell rings) (priest chants in Sanskrit) - Hello. (chanting in Hindi) - I'm tired of running around after you. You should have called and let us know where you are. - Yeah, well you were the one who kicked me out of the house. - And I don't regret it. It's your mother who worries about you. She worries about you day and night. If you have any respect for her, I mean any respect for her, just come back, okay? Just come back. But I won't tell her anything about all this. Go, go, wash, wash up and come upstairs. - So, you still going out with Kevin? - Yeah. - I don't believe it and your parents, they haven't suspected a thing? - Not yet, I'm pretty careful. I mostly see him at school. - Are you still sneaking out at night? - [Asha] Yeah, sometimes. - I'd get caught just like that. - Asha! Come on, let's go, I need some servers. (traditional Indian music) (gentle instrumental music) (upbeat piano music) (car engine roars) (upbeat piano music) - It's not fair I'm a secret in your life, is it? - It has to be, I can't help it. - But we love each other. - Love is a crime in my culture. Besides, you said so yourself, secrecy is more romantic, more fun. - I didn't mean a secret till death do us part. We've been seeing each other for almost two years now. I just wanna be able to see you whenever I want, wherever I want. We deserve that. I know I'm just a gas attendant right now but I have my business degree, lots of interviews. Sooner or later, I'm gonna get a real job but in the meantime - Kevin. - [Kevin] In the meantime, let's make it official. - What do you mean? Make what official? - Maybe your parents will come around if we show them that we're serious. - They'll never take it seriously. They'll kill me for doing any of this, especially with you. - [Kevin] Then we'll elope, they'll sure get serious then. - It's not a joke. - I'm not joking. I just think we're pushing this secret thing a little too far. Look, forget it. (rock music in background) - Here you go man, exactly what you ordered. We even then, right? I owe you nothing? (rock music in background) - So, what are you gonna do with it man? (upbeat rock music) - I'm moving out man. - What? - I said I'm moving out. - What the hell are you talking about, you just moved in. - Well, I'm moving out tonight. - Well, I need my money man. Ajay, I need my two grand. Ajay! (upbeat rock music) (bells chiming) - Asha, Asha it's 8:30. (car engine roars) - Where from did you get the money for the car insurance? - It doesn't have any insurance. - You don't seem to have had much experience in management. What have you been doing since graduation? - Odd jobs here and there. Right now, I'm working as a gas attendant. - Hmm. - You know, my parents were pretty upset when I told them I wanted to move to another province. I mean, there's a lot of kilometers between Vancouver and Saskatoon. We visit once in a while. What I'm trying to say is, my parents eventually realized that I am my own person and I can take care of myself. Your parents will realize that too. - I don't think so. They don't think like you or your parents. My parents don't even think like me. They don't care about independence or individuality, especially for a woman. They live here, they just don't seem to wanna belong here. - Where do you wanna belong? I mean, you can't keep me a secret forever. - What do you want me to do? Pack up and run away with you? - That is an alternative that we have. - Hello professor Ratanji and how was school today? - You know Paul, I was promoted as soon as I landed in this country. Now, I'm a servant man, a full fledged servant. (laughs) Hello everybody. How are you? - For years, I've been telling you to change your work, anything but a janitor, it doesn't suit you. I mean, you're an educated man. - And my friend, for years and years I have been telling you too, that being a janitor is my bread and butter. It's too late to change now. My education doesn't mean much. - He's right. It's too late, we're too old to change. - We'll have to change you sir. - November 22nd, 1965, my biggest mistake. I left Fiji for a better life and look, I'm living but I don't have one bit of life. It's too late, too late to change. - My friend, whenever I come here, you're always complaining, about this or that, always complaining. Why don't you just drink and get drunk peacefully? - Why do you come here? - I have been coming here for the last 18 years. I helped to build this place. - Why? - To relax, my friend, to relax. To be here with all of my old friends. To have a few drinks with them. To have few laughs with them. - Why do you all have to come here and not go to the white pub across the street? You all could relax there, get drunk there. Why do you have to come here? I'll tell you why, because you and all of you do not have any life neither. This place is the only piece of life you have left, that's why you've been coming here for the last 18 years. - [Bartender] I think you need another drink sir. - I will have one too, yaar. What's the matter? Ajay did something? - I'm not worried Ajay. I'm worried about Asha. She's 23 years old. Are you planning to keep her home all her life? - This is her last year. She will have her degree and then we will plan to arrange her wedding. - For years, I've tried to be a good wife and a good mother. I do all the cleaning, all the cooking and everything. I even took a full time job and I've never complained about anything. But I need your help now. We have to deal with Asha's marriage together. I don't understand why you wanna keep putting it off. - She is in the university. She has to finish her education, okay? - [Mrs. Ratanji] What is she gonna do with that education, support you? I don't know where your head is sometimes. - Well, it'll only be good for her. She will have her degree and then properly, we will prepare for her wedding. - We can find her a suitor. She can get engaged now and finish school at the same time. - More or less, only few more months to go. At least one of our children will have an education. You worry too much. There is always a time and a place for everything, all right? - She's not a little girl anymore, she's a grown up woman and we have to worry about her. (gentle music) Just because we are in different country, doesn't mean that we don't have any responsibilities anymore. What if Asha does something wrong tomorrow and brings on shame to the family? Will her degree be any good then? Can you kick out Asha the same way that you did Ajay? Us parents have to be more protective about our daughters. Doesn't matter what country we live in. - Okay, okay, we will have a good serious talk with Asha about wedding, okay? (gentle music) (upbeat rock music) (kids giggling) (eerie music) (people speaking in background) (eerie music) (people speaking in background) (eerie music) (static sounds) - [Mrs. Ratanji] Answer me! - Why are you so quiet? Answer your mother. Where did you go? It's four o'clock in the morning. What were you doing all night? - I went to a party. - [Mr. Ratanji] Who's party? - It was at the university residence. - Then, why didn't you tell us about it? - [Asha] I knew you wouldn't let me go. - How long have you been doing this behind our backs? Sneaking out in the middle of night like a thief. Answer me! Ajay, did you know anything about this? - How did you go there? Who else was with you? - [Asha] A friend, we were in her car. - Why don't you leave her alone. - You stay out of it. It's through your bad example that she's doing all this. - I'm only going to ask you once and I wanna know the truth, who was with you? - Just a friend. - I'm not gonna waste any time anymore. We have to arrange her marriage and right away. I'm not a fool. Don't think we don't know what's going on. I want you to stay home from now on, no more university. Is this what they teach you at school, lying and betraying your parents? - I told you, I was at a friend's, okay. You can't just force me to get married just like that. You don't own me. - [Mrs. Ratanji] My God. (telephone rings) - [Worker] Hello. Hold on. Kevin, phone! - Hello. Hey, how you doing? - [Asha] Mom caught me sneaking back in. - [Kevin] So what happened, are you okay? - No, I'm fine. I told them I was at a party last night and now mom wants me to get married. - [Kevin] What did you say to her? Do they know? - I don't know if they suspect anything. They probably do. - [Kevin] Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. - You wanna go to the cabin? Okay, I'm gonna be about an hour. Okay, goodbye. (chants in Sanskrit) - We should do a little more thinking before we jump into it just like this. It's something that should not be rushed into. - I waited for a long time. She has been doing whatever she wants to do, her education is finished and now it's time that she understands her responsibilities. - But coming to the temple and asking the priest for the exact wedding dates, I think it's a little far fetched. At least we should find a suitor for her first. Then we can calmly talk to her and come to a decision. I'm sure she will listen. She's not like Ajay. - Ajay is not in question. Ajay is young and he'll be fine in a few years. I'm more concerned about the problem with Asha. - Well, we cannot force her and drag her into the marriage, can we? - [Mrs. Ratanji] Then, what do you suggest we should do? - I have thought about it very carefully and this is the only chance of marriage for Asha we have. We can tell her that she can choose any suitor she wants to, as long as he comes from the Hindu background. I'm sure she will take that more seriously than an arranged cast marriage. (chants in Hindi) - There was a time when Asha and Ajay used to come to the temple with us. Things are changing too fast. (gentle instrumental music) (dogs barking) (gentle instrumental music) - I don't blame them for who they are. Although dad's educated, he's traditional at the same time. It's just the way it is, especially my mom. They have set ways of doing everything. Ajay's put them through hell and they worry about me because I'm a girl. They've learnt to live here in their own world, the temple, the religious rituals, the Hindi movies, it's who they are. - And who do you wanna be? - Do you know who you are? - I'm one white guy your parents will eventually wanna injure. - They probably wanna injure me first. - [Kevin] Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with this mess. - Then, why do you? - Because I think you're intelligent, ambitious, caring and beautiful. - I'm also a liar. Every time I'm with you, my parents think I'm studying at the library. This time, I didn't even tell them anything. (gentle instrumental music) I don't wanna lie to my parents anymore. I'm gonna tell them about us. - [Kevin] Sounds like you found out who you are. - I think I know who I want to be. I know I am intelligent, and ambitious and stubborn but I also wanna have some respect and independence and to do that, I have to be honest and tell them everything. - From what I figure, that's a pretty tall order for your parents. I got a job offer. - That's great, which one, where? - [Kevin] I got the letter yesterday, it's the company in Victoria. - Victoria, that's on the island. - Yeah, but it's a good position. - [Asha] What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna take it. - [Asha] You'll have to move. - I know. It'll give us a chance to start out on our own. Don't you wanna be on your own? Your parents are never gonna accept us anyway. If we're gonna stay together, we have to move on. (traditional Indian music) - Ajay! Ajay! (kids giggling in background) (gentle Indian music) - I knew your dad back in Fiji, he came for you guys but now more and more, children are screwing up their future themselves. All the fashion, boyfriend, girlfriend, drugs. That's not us, that's for white people, we're not white people. All we want is that they get a good education, get a good job, respect their elders, their culture but I guess we're old fashioned, especially your father and stubborn too. He's a good man, I can always count on him. - It's been so long since we ate together like this. This is the way it should be. This is exactly the way a family is supposed to act like. - Ajay! (Mr. Ratanji speaks in Hindi) - I think we need to talk. - We need to talk to you too, Asha. We'll talk after the dinner, okay? - Why is he so angry? All I said was, we should be a family. He didn't need to walk out like this. - You said, we should 'act' like a family. (upbeat rock music) ♪ Ah, is it two o'clock already ♪ ♪ Ah, what time is it out there man ♪ ♪ Ah, I feel like shit ♪ ♪ I need a coffee ♪ ♪ Crashed, shut down up on the couch ♪ ♪ Cigarette stuck in my mouth ♪ ♪ Hazy clouds know who I am ♪ ♪ I live off green eggs and ham ♪ ♪ Yesterday, I took a walk ♪ (door knocking) (rock music in background) - It's okay man, open the door. (rock music in background) Ajay, I knew it was you man, you still remember the knock. So, where you been? - Close the door. - So, you gonna get my money? Your account is seriously overdue. (rock music in background) What are you doing man? Put it down. - I don't got your money. - [Hoodlum] The chevelle? - It's all I got. - Yeah, this oughta cover it. (car engine roars) Ajay, come here. You don't have to do this man, I can wait for the money. - I won't have anything later. - Well, it runs great. Something wrong with it? (grandmother speaks in Hindi) - You have a boyfriend! You wanna marry him, huh? How could you defy us-- (mother speaks in Hindi) - That's enough. - Get away. How could you do that. How could you do that to me. - That's enough, she's had enough! - Get lost! How could you do that to me! - Stop! - I'm gonna kill you! I said get lost! - That's enough! - I'm gonna kill you! - That's enough! (family arguing) - You touch her again, I'll kill you! - Things are changing so fast-- - Dad and you have changed. You just don't care to know what's happening outside of this house, outside of your own world. It's a different world out there, I wasn't doing anything wrong. - You were lying to us, lying and doing things that you're not supposed to do. - [Asha] Some things just happen, I didn't plan it. - But you knew what was expected of you. Asha, it doesn't matter what kind of world is outside this house. We have our ways of doing things, that can never change. - It's too late now, things are changing. Look at Ajay, do you think he cares about who he is? I remember when he and dad used to do things together all the time, how he used to be so close. - [Mrs. Ratanji] Things will be still good, if you just try to understand us. - Have you ever tried to understand us, what we wanna do? Hasn't it always been what we should do and shouldn't do? - What do you want us to do? Give up? Pretend everything is going to be okay? Asha Asha, we only try to protect you. We hear so many stories about other kids going into drugs, running away from home, doing all sorts of things. - Have you ever thought about why they do drugs? Why they run away? - [Mrs. Ratanji] What do you want us to do? - I don't know. All I know is that you guys are making us hate you. - You should have called the cops, all of this is totally illegal. - I don't wanna think about it anymore. - You shouldn't let them get off that easy, let me deal with it. - Just forget about it. - I guess it wasn't such a good idea to tell your parents after all. What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. - [Kevin] What about us? - I don't know. - Are we breaking up? - No! I just don't know what to do. - [Kevin] You still have an option, you can come with me. Let's get away from all of this. - It doesn't feel right just to pack up and run away. - [Kevin] You're not running away. - Of course, I'd be running away. I have to break off ties with my parents and everything. I don't think I'm ready to do all that. - You don't have to break off any kind of ties. You're still Asha Ratanji, that'll never change, you just don't agree with what your parents want and you don't wanna do what they say. It's time to move on. - You shouldn't have told them anything. - What did you expect them to do, congratulate you? You had a boyfriend, a white boyfriend. - I don't think it would have mattered what race Kevin is, they'd still freak out. What would parents do if they found out about Sanjay? - Freak out, but I'd never tell them about him. - I've already decided to go with Kevin. - So, you're gonna run away, huh? - I'm not running away. - What do you want her to do, sit at home and wait for her parents to come around? - They'll disown her. I think you're jumping the gun, Asha. - Kevin and I have already decided, I'll transfer all my courses, get a part time job and do my own thing. - Have you told your parents about it? - No. - Don't you think one beating's good enough? - I just wanted to let you guys know about it. I also need some money. - Sure. - Sure but I'd like it back, I may need it too. (traditional Indian music) (singing in Hindi) (traditional Indian music) (singing in Hindi) - Ratanji bhai, your son is here to take you home. - Mom wants you home. - [Mr. Ratanji] Come here. Sit down, have a drink with me. - Look, I'm here to take you home. - Come on. One drink won't harm you, okay? - [Bartender] The bar is closed. - How can that be? I wanna have my drink with my only son. Open the bar, yaar. - [Bartender] Your son is here to take you home. - Come on. Come on. Can't I have a drink but I'm not worried. Your mom is worried. She is worried. Do you worry about anything Ajay? I mean, do you have anyone? - No. - You're right, only father and a mother can worry. They worry about their children. Day and night. - Yeah, well you don't have to worry about me. - What did you say? - Nothing. - No, you said something. What did you say? - I said, you don't have to worry about me anymore. - You mean by telling me that, I'm supposed to stop worrying, huh? - Look, it doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter to you man, it matters to me and to your mother. But it doesn't matter to you. - That's right 'cause the only thing you know how to do is worry and so what? I mean, does it fix anything huh? No, but you and ma, you keep worrying because that's all you know how to do. I'm telling you, it's not such a big thing. It doesn't fix anything. - You have it all figured out, my son. - [Ajay] No, I have nothing figured out. - But I have it figured out. For 20 years, I worked. Your mother worked. We sacrificed so much so our family could feel safe. They could have anything they need and it amounts to nothing, nothing. I lost my son. I lost my daughter and you were right, all that I can do is worry. Just worry. Don't you and Asha need us anymore? (gentle music) We brought you up, taught you everything we knew. You've become so Canadian that you want to abandon us? You never listen what we say. Asha packs and leaves. What did we do so wrong? All I wanted was to survive, be a family. I haven't become Canadian like you and Asha but don't punish us for who we are. We are your parents. We gave you life. - Hello, who's this? Yes, this is Asha's mom. Is Meena there please? Where is she? The soccer field. - [Mr. Ratanji] What are you doing? - Getting ready. Somebody has to go and find Asha. - Asha left on her own, she won't be coming back. - I still need to find her, I'm her mother. Maybe you can go to the bar, get drunk and forget about everything. I can't. - It's no use. Both Asha and Ajay, they don't care what we say or what we do. - I don't care anymore. I don't want to sacrifice them over anything. They're my children. Our children. Without them, we are nothing. - Then, what were you thinking before? - I'm gonna go to the soccer field, Aruna and Meena are there, they'll know something. - No, no. You won't go. I will go. It's me who made her run away, so it should be me to bring her back. (people shouting in background) - Meena, can I talk to you? I'm looking for Asha. - I don't know where she is. - Look, I am worried and so is her mother. You are her friend, she must have told you something. - All I know is, she doesn't wanna go back home. - [Mr. Ratanji] We just want to talk to her and then, she can do whatever she wants. - Okay, but she's already made some plans. She's leaving Vancouver tonight. - [Mr. Rathanji] Where is she going? - I can't tell you that. - [Mr. Ratanji] Where is she now? Maybe I can call her. - I can't tell you that, I don't know. - [Mr. Ratanji] Do your parents know about him? - No. - Meena, I just want to talk to Asha, nothing else. (people shouting in background) (gunshot fires) (grandmother speaks in Hindi) (grandmother speaks in Hindi) (grandmother speaks in Hindi) (telephone rings) - Hello. - Asha. (Mr. Ratanji sobs) (gentle instrumental music) - So, I guess you've been quite busy these past few months. - I have a part time job. University keeps me busy, I guess. - And you're on your own after all. - Yeah, guess it was meant to be. - [Kevin] You still keep in touch with your folks? - Mostly with my mother. Dad's still having a hard time. He's seeing a counselor. - [Kevin] How are you? - Better. That's why I contacted you. Think I've got some explaining to do. - You don't have to explain anything. I'm just happy to hear from you. It's been a long time. - I didn't mean to break it off so sud denly. But Ajay's death really shocked mom and dad. (Priest chants in background) Shocked me too. I was confused and decided I should be by my parents. They've been through a lot. Dad still hasn't recovered and I wanted to let you know now that it wouldn't have been any better if we'd continued our relationship. If I'd ran off with you, I still wouldn't know where I was going. I'm still trying to work it out and that's why I live here in my own personal world. I'm running away from nothing. I guess I'm still trying to figure out who I am. I try to keep in touch with my family and I'm hoping I can still keep in touch with you. (gentle music) - I like your world. (gentle music) (priest chants in Sanskrit) (traditional Indian music)
