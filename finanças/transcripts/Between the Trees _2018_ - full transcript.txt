Wait, did you bring your phone? No. Fuck! Well how far is the highway? What does that matter if we don't have a fucking phone? Look, I'm gonna go back to the cabin and go grab mine. Keep your eyes out. Yeah. (TENSE MUSIC) Holy shit! Have a drink, relax. Nah, it's too early for that. How we gonna get out of here. Here's how its gonna go. Steve and Dave are gonna walk to the highway. From the highway, they'll call for help. From the highway, their cell phones will work. That's right! They'll tell the police where we are and the cavalry arrives to save the day. That's good, that's good! MAC: It is good. Alright, thank you. What are you doing, where's Dave? Forgot my phone.
