(intense drum roll) (ethereal music) - [Ben] I gotta go, I gotta go! I gotta go! - Go, go, go! (tires screeching) (ominous music) (tires screech) (ominous music) - [Ben] Why did the Cadillac's take Spanky, and why now? We aren't the gang anymore. Before, they used to chase us all the time. But since Father Joe took us out of the gangs, nothing ever happened. (train whistles) You see, six months ago, Father Joe started getting everybody out of the gangs. He got the Corvettes out, the Mojados out, us, and the Tornadoes out. To get the Tornadoes, he started a gym. (man speaks Spanish) - Hey, hello, Chinto, you're more than welcome. How many? - Just one. I'm gonna kick his ass. - Hey you have more interest than that. We need at least three. - I just want to show him who's boss. - Anytime, any place. - What about right now? - (man speaks Spanish) (intense music) - [Ben] The Mojados used to put graffiti all over the place so Father Joe convinced them to put it on t-shirts and sell them. Comet and his Corvettes liked guns a lot so Father Joe turned them into security guards. (punches thud) - [Ben] Come on Tavo! Get him to the right, Tavo. Get right, Tavo. Yeah, yeah. Alright Tavo! - Shit! - Hey! (punch thuds) - Ouch! - [Frankie] This is my hood, holmes. We call it en barrio. I'm Frankie, and I run the Cadillac's and the Cadillac's run en barrio ese but now I'm in this trunk betrayed by my own people. Let me tell you this, holmes, I know when this shit started. It was six months ago at the time of the fight. - What's with the kids ese? - (speaking Spanish) - (speaking Spanish) (punch thuds) - No more bullshit, holmes, nothing goes down in the barrio if it doesn't go through us. (punches thud) (crowd shouts) Drugs is a racket, ese and business was booming, holmes. (pager beeps) (speaks Spanish) (punches thud) (men shout in Spanish) - (speaks Spanish) - Hey holmes, Cesar earn our respect. He was in jail for 10 years for the barrio, ese. - [Ben] Cesar was a Cadillac 10 years ago but his wife was killed in a drive-by and he took revenge. He was sent to jail or else he would be the Cadillac's main guy instead of Frankie for sure but when he got out of jail, he didn't like gangs anymore. (car engine hums) - How you doing? - Fine. - Corvette engine? - Yes, sir. - Okay? - Yes, sir. - Mind if I try something? - Yeah, go ahead. - He'll come around. (intense music) - [Ben] This is how the Cadillac's initiate you into their gang and some people even like it. If that's the start, imagine the end, no way, Jose. (intense music) - Hey, Frankie. (punch thuds) - Give it a shot (engine sputters) (engine revs) - [Mechanic] That's great. - Yeah, these '58s, do the Taurus for faulty contacts. - You must really know your engines. - Yeah. I really need a job. - Well, you came to the right place. - I know, what do you pay? - About 6.50 an hour. - Time and a half for overtime? - Sounds pretty good to me. - [Frankie] Everybody pretends in the barrio, holmes but they didn't fool me. Cesar wants to be Mr. Goody Two Shoes now and the kids, running scams, but in front of Father Joe, they behave like little angels, ese. (playful music) - It fell from up there. - Oh, you kids, well, let me try to get it back to it's nest. You poor little thing. I'll have you up there in no time. (bird chirps) There we go. - It's right there. - Ah, steady there, there you go, there. (Father Joe shouts) (bell clangs) - Whoa, Father Joe is gold. (Father Joe shouts) (boy laughs) - Oh, God, oh. - Father Joe? - Yes? - Are you okay? - Yeah, thank you. - Spanky didn't see it, can you do that again? - Get oughta here (groans). - [Ben] (chuckles) Poor Father Joe, he didn't know that we had a gang. Oh, but to go back to gangs, the last one was the Ramirez. People respect Frankie but everybody was afraid of Manuel Ramirez. We used to call him the Boogeyman. The night the police got him, they were going to kill him but a Captain saved him. (ominous music) - Who's in charge here? - I am, Captain. We've got Ramirez in there and I'm going in there to kill his ass. - Shit! - It's called proper procedure, Sargent. - He just properly killed three people dead, sir. - Everybody has the same rights, Sargent. Turn your lights on. - Yes, Captain. - Lights. - [Ben] Manuel paid the Captain back the only way he knew. - Mike, where do they get these guys? - I have no idea. - Manuel Ramirez, Manuel Ramirez, it's the police, come out with your hands up. (gun blasts) (Captain groans) (gun blasts) (glass breaks) (guns blast) (suspenseful music) - [Police] Come out with your hands up. Come out with your hands up. (guns blast) - [Ben] Those were the people in my barrio six months ago. I thought everything had changed but now I don't know. (upbeat jazz music) - [Frankie] The kids had a very interesting racket, holmes and they were making money. Father Joe didn't even suspect it. Spanky was good with computers and somehow they'd got merchandise for free. I don't know shit about computers, holmes, but I know this. Nobody makes money in the barrio without giving me my share. Hell no. You don't do that, ese. Not in my barrio. Hey, Ces, what's up, ese? - How you doing, Frank? - Looking good. Hey, how long have you been out? - About three months. - Three months? You forgot your manners, ese. You're supposed to report to me. - I don't have to report to anybody. - Wrong, you do. See, I call the shots around here now, so if you live around here you got to listen to me, holmes. I'm the boss now. - The boss, Frank? The boss over who? You and I both know you're just another puppet. - You can't talk to me that way, holmes! I own this turf! - I'll talk any way I like. I paid my dues. - (speaks Spanish) - (speaks Spanish) - Hey, Father Joe. - Frankie. - I need to talk to that Spanky guy. - Hey, you stay away from my kid. - I'll see you later, holmes. I need to see him tomorrow, Priest. - Is everything okay, Cesar? - I don't know, Father. What's Spanky got to do with him? - I don't know. - Maybe we should ask him. - You pick up the merchandise tomorrow at 4PM at the Rio Mesa Storage, 4500 North Mesa, cash and carry. (phone beeps) It's a pleasure doing business with you. (keyboard clacks) Let's see what's available. Voila! S14. - You have to understand. Legally, Spanky does not belong to you anymore. - I know that, Father. But I've done my time. I got a good job, a nice home and I'm not into that (speaks Spanish) anymore. - [Frankie] But your son is, ese. Right under Father Joe's nose. They're the only ones that go to church to get money, not to give it, ese. - Nothing like a good day's work. Okay now change location for the chocolate delivery to Rio Mesa Storage, S14. - I want him back. I need him back. - It's not up to me, it's up to Spanky. You know you have to earn his trust and love. He knows you're his father but he doesn't know you. - I'd like to try. - I'll tell you what, you wait here, I'll go get him, he's a wonderful kid. (gentle music) Spanky, this is your father. - How you doing, son? - Fine. - My god, how you've grown. - You know what, I have a great idea. Why don't you guys spend the weekend together? - Would you like that? You like fishing? - Yes. - Good, good. Well listen, just have him back by 8:00 Sunday, school on Monday. (ominous music) - The Ramirez, ese (chuckles) (speaks Spanish). Chin and his brother knew they were lost without Manuel. Without him, they were nothing, holmes. (ominous music) - Shit! - Morning, Cesar. How you doing? - Pretty good, pretty good. - So what happened, did you finally get to see your kid? - Yeah. It was great. I even talked the priest into letting him spend the weekend with me. - And where's the boy now? - Well, he's at home, waiting for me. - So what are you doing here? - Well, I've got to work, ese, I've got to make some (speaks Spanish). - Tell you what, take the rest of the day off, it's on me. - Seriously? - No problem at all, no problem. - Thanks a lot, I owe you one. - No sweat. - Listen, you couldn't throw a little overtime in there while you're at it? - Nah, get out of here, don't press your luck, I'll see you Monday. - [Frankie] The barrio was full of surprises, holmes. Shaved Ice Raul bought a gun to protect himself against the Tornados. They had beaten him up. He didn't want to pay protection, ese. - I'm glad to see you. - Hi, Father Joe, what brings you here today? - I heard someone got a real bargain on a gun today. - Well, I guess you were well informed, padre. - A gun isn't gonna solve our problems, Raul. - But it solves theirs! - Oh, you wanna play their game? They put you in the hospital, what's next, the cemetery? - Well I guess it was about time somebody played their game. - But, Raul, the Tornadoes have 50 gang members, you're gonna need a lot more guns. - Everybody that plays their game ends up dead. - Well, what do you want me to do? I'm a man. - Yes, you are but dying with a gun in your hand doesn't make you more of a man, understand, it makes you less. - I love you the way you are. Look what they did to you, they're animals. - [Ben] For some people, a gun is a lot but for others, it's like nothing. - Gun fights for the Cadillacs are daily bread, holmes, but boxing, boxing gets in the barrio blood, ese and we were very excited about the smoker. I had two fighters and watch it, holmes, I knew it was a scam from Father Joe to get the Tornadoes, but let's enjoy the ride, ese. (rock music) Can I talk to Mr. D., holmes? - Did he call you, ese? - Yes, he did, must be some important shit, so (speaks Spanish), you chill, alright? - [Man] I'll go with you, ese. - No, holmes, chill. (upbeat music) Hey, hold it. I like this shit, man. - You like it, Frankie? It's two bucks. - What the fuck's wrong with you, two bucks? - No, no, no, no, no, Frankie, no, that's yours, you can keep it, man, you can keep it. - Beat it (speaking Spanish). (metal clanks) (ominous music) - Go ahead, eh, go ahead, make my day, uh, give me a reason, eh? Sit down. You guys, eh, look at me, ese, take those things off your head, take the bandanas off your head. (ominous music) I said now, eh, we don't take that shit around here. Alright. (phone rings) (ominous music) - You alright, ese? - What happened to you, ese? - Shut up, I got this. - We'll kill him. - We're gonna kill this motherfucker. - Hey, be smart and wait awhile. - You alright, right, holmes? Gotta take it easy. - You have to learn to be calm. And then, you kill the son of a bitch that set me up. - Right. - [Ben] In the gangs, everybody says, I'm the boss but they have to answer to somebody else. Frankie answers to Mr. D., we answer to nobody. - [Frankie] Those kids have to answer to me, holmes. Sooner or later (speaks Spanish). - [Ben] Mr. D. had a lot of money and a very long car. - [Frankie] With their angel faces, they thought they could get away with anything. No way, holmes. (playful music) - [Ben] Hi. - What do you want? - My father's waiting for you but he had to leave. It's S14. - Well, I need the code to get in and somebody to unload it, no, this ain't gonna work. - I got the code and I can unload it. - It's gonna be one of those days. (playful music) - [Ben] Our business was booming and it was very easy. You see, grownups believe anything your kid tells them. - [Frankie] Mr. D. is a prick, holmes, with his bulletproof car and his big mansion. He lives in a completely different world. He never messed with my world before, this is when he did but he's going to regret it, holmes. (upbeat Latin-inspired music) - Hi, Father Joe. - (speaks Spanish) (upbeat Latin-inspired music) - Can I have some more? - Good, good, how are you? You still good, take care of yourself. - Thank you. - Good afternoon, Raul. - Father Joe, what brings you here today? - This is Comet, he's gonna be in charge of your security from now on. - What's up, ese? - He's gonna take care of that problem with the Tornadoes. - Father, you're bringing in another gang member, won't that complicate things even more? - Hey man, we're not in the gang anymore, ese. We are a legitimate security business. Hell, we even pay taxes. You know, I know where you're coming from. I'll take care of you. - Father, I wanna put this one in your hands. - Trust me, it'll work. - [Mr. D.] Man, this Father Joseph's becoming a real pain in the ass. - [Frankie] He's cool, holmes, he doesn't bother me. - Well it bothers the hell out of me. Mojados are doing art and these funky ass t-shirts and these caps, the Corvettes, they're doing security, it blows my mind. - Hey, less competition for me, ese. I like that, I like that. - But I don't make any sales and that sucks real big. This bullshit about Mano Y Mano. - Hey, a lot of people are very excited about that, holmes. I've got-- - Precisely my point, Frankie, and it ain't gonna happen in my town. - It's too late, ese, it's on Saturday. - I said it ain't gonna happen in my town and it ain't gonna happen. - Where do you get off on this, holmes? It's nothing but fights in between gangs, what's your problem? - You don't see it but it's a real clever plan by this priest, messing with your little brain, makes everybody think of a fair game, boxing is a discipline. I know, I was a boxer myself a long time ago, of course, I'm cured now but you're gonna sit down. - [Ben] Mmm, chocolates are my favorite and this is work. I can work all day long. (gentle music) - I'd like to meet your father. I can kick his ass right now. - Relax. Here, take a chocolate. (truck driver laughs) - You should be grateful, he is looking out for you. - (speaks Spanish) - Hey, watch it, punk! - You watch it, you goon fuck. What, you wanna piece of me, you motherfucker? - Relax. - You want a piece of me? Fuck you. - Just-- - [Ben] Like I told you, everybody answers to somebody else. Father Joe used to belong to a gang too, a long time ago. One day, I heard him talking to a guy on a motorcycle. I think they used to be called The Sixties. (upbeat music) (motorcycles hum) (somber music) (thunder rumbles) (ominous music) - Good fucking morning, ese. - What do you want? - What do I want? What do I want? (crowd murmurs) I gave you two days to move and you didn't, ese, now, it's too late. - (crowd) Hey. (spray can hisses) (sirens wail) (intense music) - I'm in charge of this business's security and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you in, you piece of shit. I don't know how long I'm gonna keep you but when you get out, you're gonna have a restraining order against you and if I see your face around here again, you're history. - Hey, man (groans). - Get him out of here. - What the fuck? - [Frankie] The Grungers, they're as strong as the Cadillacs on the white side of town, ese and they also work for Mr. D. It was a big mistake for Mr. D. to get them involved in stopping the boxing smoker, holmes but they'll regret it soon enough, all of them. Damn Grunge (speaks Spanish), you're in the barrio now, so you better watch it, ese. (ominous music) - What's up? - What's up, ese? What the hell brings you to bean country, holmes? - Mr. D. asked me to give you a hand. - A hand with what? - He's very concerned with this Mono Y Mono smoker shit. - That shit's coming down in my territory. - I don't want your fucking territory. - Then get the fuck out. (guns cock) - The favor was for Mr. D., not for you. - I don't need any favors from you, asshole. - Don't let me catch you alone, motherfucker. - Don't worry, you won't and you got five minutes to save your ass, so move it! - Mr. D.'s not gonna like this. - Shut up! You're still here? - You're fucking with the wrong guy. - Three minutes. (Cadillacs laugh) - I was only trying to help, ese. - Don't help me. - Man, fuck that, dude I'm going back. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Are you crazy? - Do you hear them laughing at us? - You think I like this shit? Get the fuck out of here. - [Ben] The whole barrio was ready for the boxing smoker but Frankie and Mr. D. were more ready. Father Joe starts suspecting something so he asks Cesar for his help but like I said before, Cesar didn't want to be involved with the gangs anymore, good or bad. - Hey, Padre. - Hi. - We're good, be right there. Okay, you can practice that, alright? - Okay. - You practice enough with this one, I'll get you a good one, alright? How you doing, padre? - Good, good. How are you doing? - (sighs) I feel like my life's starting over again. - [Frankie] Cesar knew the gang style, ese, forget the rest, take care of your own (speaks Spanish). - He could be very instrumental in making it real successful for us, I could use your help. - It's an honor, padre but I can't deal with those people right now. I got to concentrate on my life and my kid and that's it. - I guess that means no? - I'm sorry. (soft music) (Father Joe sighs) (speaks Spanish) - Go away! - I'm just going to leave it here. - You're wasting your time. You don't know who you are dealing with. - I know, I've seen so many like you. You're so mean you should have horns and a tail. - You'd be surprised. - So, take it or leave it. You've got three seconds. - Perfectly good merchandise, you have no excuse. - I don't care where, you can't beat the price. - So? - Going once. - [Girl] It's your call. - Taken. (sad music) (machine gun blasts) - [Frankie] Easy money for a hard life, holmes. - [Father Joe] We're running out of time. - [Spanky] Almost ready. - Excuse me, padre? - Raul, don't excuse yourself, come on in, I'll be with you. (Raul clears his throat) (ominous music) - Uh, Spanky, how long will this take? - Five minutes. - Why don't you go get yourself a soda and be back in five minutes, alright? - But don't touch anything. - Bye. - Bye. - Is that the gun? - Yes, padre. - (sighs) Give it to me. (printer whirs) Don't you feel better without it and not having to use it? - [Raul] Yes, padre. - (speaks Spanish) I don't know why Mr. D. Was so worried about the fights. He even hired some professionals to beat Father Joe's fighters. I could have done it with my guys. Hey, but it's his money. See if I care. - Hey holmes, is that it? - They're all yours, you've called the other gangs? - Yes, I talked to the other gangs, they're canceling, in fact, that guy doesn't have a fight. - Good, that's when you'll start the trouble. - I know when to start the trouble, alright and you tell Mr. D. not to send Grunge into my territory, alright? - You tell him. You know, you oughta watch yourself, remember, Grunge is-- - Get him the fuck out of here! - [Ben] That place was going to be packed but thanks to Frankie and Mr. D., it was empty. - And how are things going here? - You know, father, I thought there'd be more people. - Well, I was hoping for a lot more myself but we gave it our best shot, Comet. - [Ben] Poor Father Joe, he didn't know where the real fight was and that his enemies were very powerful. - I said I'm clean, ese. Hey, Father Joe. - Frankie, I'm so happy to see you, I'm so glad you're here. Are the Cadillacs gonna participate? - Hey, Father Joe, ese, this is our turf, our barrio. - God, you're here. - Gotta be here with you. - Get off me, faggot. - You want to touch me too? You like that? - We'll get you on the program immediately, thank you for being here, Frankie. - Stop drinking. - Participants, welcome, gentlemen, welcome, you're gonna enjoy the smoker. - Get him over there. - Enjoy yourselves. Alright. Good to see you, guys, help yourselves at home, alright. - [Frankie] A famous trainer came to see the fights, ese, because Father Joe had two good fighters, El Tavo and La Wendy but against professionals, hey, no way, they were gonna hit the floor. (speaks Spanish) (ominous music) - Hey, baby. - [Woman] Hello. - Hello, come on in, the water's fine. (crowd shouts) - These are the rules, no rabbit punches, no hitting below the belt. - Who is that guy, I've never seen him before? - Me neither. I don't know. - Got your gloves, go back to your corners, come out boxing. (energetic music) - Mess him up, ese. (girl screams) (bell dings) - Yes! (punches thud) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) - Get up, get up! (crowd shouts) (punches thud) (crowd cheers) - Yes, yeah, woo! (men cheer) - Where would you like to go? - That's done. - What the hell is your problem? - Fucking Frankie's really pissing me off. (ominous music) - Okay, darling, why don't you go for a little swim, let me watch, be careful, watch out for sharks. Don't you ever discuss business in front of her, you understand? - Of course. - Look, Frankie's time's about up anyway. Right now, we gotta make him think he's in control. These guys, the more macho they are the easier they are to control. Trust me. - When his time comes, can I be there? - (laughs) Yeah, yeah, done deal. (crowd shouts) - Tavo? - Yes, Padre? - We have a problem, son. - No, we don't. - Listen to me, you beat his ass. - Joe, Tavo, this guy's a pro. - I can kick his professional ass. (energetic music) - Well. (bell dings) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) (punches thud) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) - Yeah! (punches thud) (energetic music) Come on, Tavo! (bell dings) How are you feeling, son? - [Grunger] What the fuck are you doing, dancing? - I can take this guy. - [Grunger] I don't give a fuck. - [Father Joe] Alright, let's do it. - [Grunger] You just beat him. (bell dings) (energetic music) - Come on, Tavo, come on, stick your left, come on, stick it, come on. (energetic music) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) (crowd cheers) - [Grunger Member] Fuck! - [Grunger Leader] Stay down, punk. (audience laughs) (ominous music) - Yeah, it should be over by now, Shorty. - [Shorty] What's so important about these fights? - It's a matter of trust, man, the Mojados, they believed in this priest, they're out, them guys didn't do much business anyway but they were steady. Now, when the Corvettes, when the Corvettes pulled out, yeah, that was a major fucking loss there. - Father Joe, we don't got a fighter for this one! - Look ese, there's no fight for you. As soon as they say there's no fight, let's start making a big racket. - As long as I get paid, ese. - Oh man, what a breath, ugh. - [Father Joe] Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? - Hey, I'm going to fight. - No, not against these monsters you're not. - Oh, come on, stop that shit, man, put that away. - Hey, I left my dad to train with you, you promised me a fight. There are no women so I'll fight the man. Come on, it's the not the first time. - [Ben] Far out! - You shut up, I can't let you do that. - [La Wendy] Hey, either you let me fight or I'll go back to my gang. - [Frankie] Alright. (sad piano music) - [Ben] This is gonna be good. - [Kids] Yes! - Okay, but if he starts beating you up, I'm gonna stop this fight. - Not in the first round, if you stop it in the first round, you won't see me again. (crowd shouts) - Okay, you guys know the rules. No rabbit punches, no hitting below the belt. - Next stop, barrio (speaks Spanish). - [Father Joe] You little rascal. (Ben laughs) Never, this is a sport. - Touch gloves, go back to your corners, and come out fighting. (crowd shouts) (energetic music) (bell dings) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) (crowd shouts) (punches thud) - Grungers pick up in other places, and so do the Cadillacs, the Ramirez. - Shorty, Shorty, let me explain something to you, man, it's not quite that simple. The more gangs we have, the better the business is, because of the fear, the different territories, the competition, man. (bell dings) (crowd shouts) - Now can I stop it? - [La Wendy] Are you crazy? (man gags) - Come on, ese! You gotta beat this bitch, okay? - Hit him low, he's drunk. - You're telling me, he stinks, man. - I don't care how good she is, you can marry her afterwards. You beat this bitch, understand? - [Father Joe] We ought to stop it. - No way, I can take him! - She can take him. - I'll kick his-- - I know, I know, you'll kick his ass. - For women's liberation, this is it. (upbeat Latin-inspired music) (bell dings) (crowd shouts) - I'm just the priest here, nobody listens to what I say. (crowd shouts) (punches thud) - [Shorty] Well, by this time, the problem is already solved. - Hey! It fucking better be. (punches thud) - Break it up, break it up! (punches thud) - Stick him, come on! (kids cheer) - Two-- - Get the hell off of him! (crowd applauds) - [Father Joe] Alright, we did it. - [Grunger Leader] At least mine was beaten by a man (laughs). - I made a deal with Mr. D, ese. That's how come you're alive in my turf. (Grunger Leader laughs) Don't push your luck. Get the fuck out. - [Grunger Leader] Let's go, let's get the fuck out of here. (Grungers laughs) - [Ben] Father Joe was laughing on the outside but inside he was very, very sad. (sad piano music) All that work and the Tornadoes didn't even show up. - Couldn't sleep either, huh? - [Priest] No. Lord, my back hurts (groans). - [Father Joe] This could have worked, I know it could've worked. - We tried, Joe. We really did. - We just don't know our enemies. - [Priest] Frankie and Grunge, oh, holy St. Patrick, my legs hurt (groans). They don't have the brains for this and besides, those two guys, they're from out of town. From Nevada. - [Father Joe] How do you know? Who are you? - I'm George LeBreton. I'm a professional trainer. Those guys used to be real contenders and the guy that won, he could've killed your boy. He's a professional street fighter. - [Father Joe] Why are they here? - Somebody must have flown them in, gloves for hire. - Father Joe] I don't believe this. - Somebody was trying to crush your little smoker here, padre. It's somebody with some real good connections and they knew exactly where to look. - We must have gotten somebody very angry, that means we're doing something right. - Joe, look, look! - [Crowd] We want to train! - [Crowd] We want to train! - [Crowd] We want to train! - [Crowd] We want to train! (crowd continues chanting) - [Priest] It worked, Joe, it really worked. - [Crowd] We want to train! We want to train! - [Woman] We want to learn how to fight like her. - [Crowd] Yeah (cheers). - [Father Joe] Well what do you want? - [George] I wanna train those two. I can make them world champions. (uplifting music) - [Father Joe] Okay, but not just those two, you're gonna have to train everybody. - [Tavo] Whatever Father Joe says. - [La Wendy] He's the boss. - Talk to them, they're all yours. - Alright, listen up, everybody. Gather 'round, listen up. Most of you have already heard about me already. I have made more champions than you got cholas in this neighborhood. Those two, those two right there. - [Crowd] We want to train, we want to train! - Whatever I tell you to do, it's gonna take a lot of hard work. This ain't no picnic. (uplifting music) (crowd cheers) - [Ben] It was getting more and more difficult to get away from Frankie's gang. - [Ben] Watch it! (playful music) - [Frankie] Hey, it could have been a coincidence, holmes, but you're in the barrio and in the barrio, you're guilty until you're proven innocent, ese and Cesar, he disrespected Juice and he disrespected our colors and you don't do that, holmes, not in my barrio. (train whistles) - [Cesar] Do I know you? - [Gang Member] Need to check your car, Cesar. - Nobody checks my car. - I'm looking for some kids, ese. (train whistles) - [Cesar] I don't know no kids. - [Gang Member] Respect the colors, holmes. - Go check Frankie's car. - I need to check your-- - [Cesar] Check my car-- (suspenseful music) - [Gang Member] Well then, you ain't going anywhere until I check your car, ese! (engine hums) - [Manuel] Go away! - [Prison Priest] Just read it. - [Manuel] Hey! (ominous music) - [Frankie] Hey Ces, tell me, how does it feel to make 6.50 an hour? - [Cesar] Hey, Frank. How does it feel to make a lot more and mess up a lot of kids? - [Frankie] You don't understand, holmes, things have changed. - Really? I don't know, things look pretty much the same to me. Bad guys on top, puppets like you in the middle, and a lot of good guys dead, the only difference is, 10 years old are carrying guns. - [Frankie] Well the way I remember it, ese, they used to say the same shit about us. - [Cesar] Yeah, but we had a difference, we fought it out, we didn't shoot it out. - [Frankie] Then how come you end up in jail, holmes? - Because I'm stupid, like all of you. - [Frankie] Chill. - [Cesar] Don't touch the car. - Frankie, when you change your mind about this vato, ese, let me know. - [Cesar] Yeah, Frankie, send me a love letter. - Listen, Ces, you earned our respect for 10 years, don't push your luck. (suspenseful music) All I ask you is to stay out of it. - [Cesar] You leave me kid out of it. I'll stay out it. - You've got a deal, holmes. Nice ride, ese. - [Ben] Bobby and Adrian, they were my best friends. (train whistles) We always thought it was all a game since our gang didn't use any guns, but violence follows gangs, no matter what kind they are. (sad piano music) - [Cesar] Spanky? - [Spanky] Yeah? - [Cesar] Want to say goodbye? - [Spanky] Goodbye. - [Cesar] Hey? Where are you going? - I was just going to hang out with Ben. - Come and hang out with me. - Well, I have some very important business to take care of with him. - Come on, Ben can wait. Come hang out with me. - Okay. - Okay, Spanky, you can tell me. What's going on? Hmm? You wanna play a lot of games or you wanna tell me the truth? I can tell, son. You're different. You got smarts, you know something, that's all you need in life. - [Spanky] No, all you need is money. - Ah, you see, that's how they get you. That's how they hooked me. - [Spanky] Yeah, but you're a big shot. (sentimental music) - This a big shot to you, someone who doesn't even know his own son? Someone who couldn't keep your mommy alive? - [Ben] 10 big ones to go. - [Father Joe] Ben? - [Ben] Hi. - What have you been doing? Come along with me, I want you to tell me exactly what's happening-- - [Frankie] (speaking Spanish), that's when they got him. They just found out what we knew all along, those thieves. - [Father Joe] A regular Al Capone and his gang. - [Ben] Who's Al Capone? - Al Capone was a gangster, mijo, like you two and he ended up in jail and he was lucky. - You boys don't wanna get killed. - [Ben] We didn't use guns, no way! - But the others do. - Listen to me, you two. Those guys are on to you and they won't let go, believe me, I know. I've been there. (phone rings) - That sounds like a mobile phone. You have a mobile phone? - [Cesar] I haven't got a phone, period. - [Boy] Come on, Spanky, pick up the phone. Spanky! (phone rings) - [Frankie] Hey, not even I knew they were making so much money, holmes. - [Spanky] Yeah? It's five for him. - [Father Joe] He's got a mobile? - [Cesar] Hey, how come you got a mobile phone? - [Ben] And I got one too! (Father Joe sighs) - [Spanky] Are we in trouble? - [Cesar] You bet your ass you're in trouble. - [Boy] I don't like to keep the money. - You've got a money problem, ese, I'll solve it for you, holmes, bring him over. So what, ese? Somebody's gotta pay for that fucking shit, ese. I don't give a fuck who. - Where to? - Frankie, Walrus and those rest of those little (speaks Spanish), that's where, let's go! Get in the fucking car. (car doors thud) (engines rev) (suspenseful music) - So you guys are really tough, huh? (speaks Spanish) You're making a killing, in my territory. You and that Spanky guy, that shit doesn't go here, holmes. I need to get a cut. I always get a cut. This is my turf. So you guys are not gonna talk? You're tough, ese, huh? I'll show you tough. Mondo. (suspenseful music) (guns pop) (guns pop) (man groans) - [Gang Member] You're gonna go out there right now. - [Boy] No way, man, I'll get shot! - [Gang Member] I'll shoot you right here. Shut up, go! Go! Go, go, go go! - [Man] Wait! (gun pops) - [Ben] I wish I could bring them back. I wish we never had that stupid gang. (sad piano music) - [Frankie] Everybody in the barrio blamed me for the deaths, holmes, and as for the kids, my respects, ese. They died on the line but only the stupid die, ese. They wanted to be in gangs, they paid the consequences. That's the way it is in the barrio. (sad piano music) As for the Ramirez, they went loco or something because of their brother but hey, that's not my fault. We went at it all night and we killed three of them and the rest, they have it coming, holmes. You do, you pay. That's the barrio way, ese. (solemn music) - [Men] Yeah! (Father Joe sobs) - Children killing children, when will it stop? When our mother's tears are dried, or we have no more children? - The barrio is ours, ese and nobody messes with us! (gang cheers) - It's our duty and responsibility to do something. We have to save the children, we have to save the barrio. - [Gang] Yeah! - It's ours! - [Gang] Hooray! (solemn music) (gang cheers) - This is so damn stupid, killing kids. How in the hell can that Frankie let this happen in his own damn territory? The worst thing about this, it's gonna be bad for business, we're gonna get bad press out of this, I know it. - Frankie's obviously not working out, I think Juice could do the job for you. - Well, I'm already working on that. - [Ben] Three months later, the boogeyman had his day in court, yes, and as to what happened, to this day, some people still don't believe it! - Has the jury reached a verdict? - Yes, Your Honor, we have. - Will the defendant please rise. (suspenseful music) Mr. Foreman, will you please read the verdict to the court. - We, the jury, find him guilty on all counts of capital murder. - Silence, bailiff, silence the court. (court murmurs) Continue Mr. Foreman. - We, the jury, find him guilty on all counts of capital murder. - Mr. Ramirez, as you know, you're being tried for a capital murder offense, therefore you are sentenced to die by lethal injection. (audience shouts) - Get off of me, man! - Ted! - Hey! That's it, huh, my brother's guilty and that's it, he's gonna die! - Bailiff! - I'll tell you something, the day he dies, you're gonna die too, bitch. (gun pops) (people scream) - [Frankie] With the help of Spanky's computer, the Mojados were selling shit all the way to Japan, ese. They were making money and legal, holmes. - Go away. - [Frankie] The boogieman was ready for his big date (laughs). - [Manuel] You're wasting your time. - [Ben] Spanky's computer was doing good on the right side of the law, better than before. - Yes, sir, alright, you got it! - [Police] Ramirez, come out with your hands up! (gun pops) (Manuel pants) - Even Shaved Ice Raul, ese, he got a cheap ice cream factory, holmes, (speaks Spanish). (upbeat music) - Our Father, who art in heaven-- (bell dings) Have you tried talking to them? - If I tell them I wanna get out, they're gonna kill me. - Is there a place or relatives that you can go to? - I got 'em but my girlfriend doesn't. - Well, let me think about, see what I can do about it. - Thank you, Father. - Go in God, son. (ominous music) (Father Joe sighs) - He is your only friend. - Manuel, there's still time. I used to belong to gangs too but I realized how wrong it was a long time ago. - I know about you, ese but it's not the same. You don't know how many people I've killed. - That doesn't matter now. What matters is you and the people you can save. - You can't erase the past but you can paint a beautiful future. (dramatic music) - Come on, you're hitting at the bottom, hit it, push it down, push it down. What are you, a loser, hit it! Alright everybody, can I have your attention? Come on, everybody, get around to here, I've got great news for everyone. - Fucking priest! His little bitch won the goddamn championship. - I did it! I won! (crowd cheers and applauds) - Just say the word and the priest is dead. - No, that's not gonna work, man. This time I'm turning it into a real fucking bloodbath. - [Shorty] He's got too much security. - That's no problem, I'm gonna make that work for us, look, the war between Frankie and Grunge is going real strong, all we gotta do is throw in Tim's gang and-- (suspenseful music) (crowd cheers) (suspenseful music) - So, I know I look insane (laughs). - Let's go get those fuckers. (crowd cheers) (suspenseful music) (guns pop) - [Frankie] I'll never forget that, ese, but they'll get theirs, very soon, very soon. Manuel Ramirez, the most feared loco in the barrios turned into a saint, holmes, and people respected him, even more than before but that was a shock for his brother, Tim, ese, (speaks Spanish). - [Manuel] I've always been your hero, why not now? - This is different, bato. You're not right, man. You're nuts or something. - (speaks Spanish) We were nuts or something. We're men. - This is all that matters, we're there to defend the barrio. - From what, from other people first and then from our own people. Don't you see it? The policeman that are killed, he was a brother. - He's a fucking pig! They're trying to finish us! - We are trying to finish us. I fought it too but it's not right. We are the ones who are wrong, not them. - What's with this fucking weird shit? - Hey! You sit down, maggot. - [Manuel] Mike, it's okay. It's okay, Mike. - [Mike] Sit down. - [Manuel] Thank you, Mike. - [Mike] Sure, Manuel, you be cool, punk. - Ese, we were doing some weird shit, that's for sure. We started this shit, but ese, now, let's be man enough to stop it. - (speaks Spanish) I can't. - You don't have to change this very minute. I know it will take time but I know you will see the right way. I know you will. (calm jazz music) - [Mr. D.] Just like that, are you sure? - [Shorty] I wish I wasn't, the Ramirez gang is gone, they've all turned into religious freaks, Tim's becoming a minister. - [Mr. D.] Fuck he was my ace. When's this boxing thing? - [Shorty] In three weeks. - [Mr. D.] Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get rid of Frankie, the priest, all that bullshit. - [Shorty] What do you want done? - [Mr. D.] I want you to get me Juice and Grunge, be careful with Juice, I don't want Frankie to suspect anything. - [Shorty] No problem. - [Mr. D.] Fucking Tim's gonna pay for it. - [Ben] That's what happened before today, as far as I know, and like I said before, we weren't in gangs anymore, then why? (train whistles) - [Mr. D.] Shorty, for our plan to work, we have to keep Grunge away from Frankie or that idiot will kill him before it's time. (suspenseful music) - [Ben] I have to get Father Joe. He helped a lot of people get out of the gangs, he'll get us out of this, he'll get Spanky back. (intense jazz music) Father Joe! - [Father Joe] Ben, what happened? - [Juice] Frankie! - Let's call the police. - Frankie! Frankie, somebody fucked up, big time, ese. - [Frankie] What the fuck's wrong with the ride, ese? - Come on, ese, come on, somebody fucked up, come on, ese. - [Frankie] You're crazy, holmes. - Come on, come on. - Give me my piece, you guys follow us. (intense jazz music) - Ah, Ben. Don't come out till I tell you, alright? Hello, hello? - You need to pay your phone bill, padre. (intense jazz music) - Hey relax, kid, it's gonna be over soon. - You're coming with me. When Juice brings Frankie, don't touch him, leave him for me. - What kind of people are you? - Shut the fuck up! Remember what I told you. - You got it, boss. - You know, your old man should have stayed with the gangs, he's really, really made me mad. - Should have been here by now. - Relax, man, we got plenty of time, plenty of time. That damn priest. (energetic music) - [Frankie] What the fuck? (Frankie groans) (punches thud) (energetic music) - Fuck. (kicks thud) (exciting music) - You bring your own people, ese. - No, you and Frankie are finished. - Frankie? Frankie? - [Juice] I'll show you how to rob-- (men shout) (guns cock) (guns pop) - [Ben] Frankie? (man coughs) - Shit, shit. Next. (guns pop) - Ben? - Yes? You have a gun. - Shut up and hide. Tell Cesar that Mr. D. is behind this bullshit. Okay, ese? - Yeah but you-- - Shut up and hide. - You have a gun in your pants. (Frankie groans) (speaks Spanish) - [Frankie] And that's how I ended up in this trunk. But hey, it comes with the territory, holmes, but let me tell you this, thanks to Ben, I've got a surprise for them. (car rumbles) - Where the fuck is Tim? - Grunge went to go get him, ese. (dramatic music) - Ow, I'll call an ambulance. - No, no, no, no, get Cesar, get as many people as you can. They're on their way to the old warehouse on dirt road. - I'll call the police. - No! No, Mr. D., he owns half of the police. You wouldn't know, you think we're reds and the Tornadoes. - Oh, man. (intense jazz music) - It's the only thing we gotta be down for now, man. God's there for you. We know the 'hood, now we know God. It's gonna be alright. - Hold it right there. Sit down! Sit down. Stay down, don't move! - Cesar, Cesar, we need a lot of, we need a lot of help. - Ben, (speaks Spanish). What happneed? - They stole Spanky and Father Joe! - Who did? - Grunge and Juice! (ominous music) - Okay, it's very simple, padre. Tim was fooling everybody about being converted and he killed you with Frankie's gun, exhibit A. (gun pops) Thank you. Now, the problem, the problem is, he killed Frankie before he killed you, what a fuck up. Now, Tim's guys are going from the Job Corp back to prison, that's where they belonged to start with and Juice and Grunge, they'll take care of business as usual. - What makes you so sure things are gonna work for you? - Well, 'cause all the guns are pointed at you, padre. - [Frankie] Not this one, asshole. (exciting music) - Juice! Take this piece of shit to Tim's and get rid of him. - Can I go? - Hey man, a deal's a deal. Oh yeah, Shorty, stop by and pick up Grunge. (exciting music) - [Frankie] It was a good plan, holmes, even for Mr. D., but I'm gonna change it to my advantage. I've got 15 bullets in this gun, five for each one of these assholes. I can't wait to see Juice's face when I kill him and then I go for Mr. D. and he's gonna regret the day he messed with the Cadillacs, ese. (dramatic music) - [Mr. D.] Where the fuck are those guys at, man? - Hey! (guns cock) Let's arrest the Raptors. (suspenseful music) (men shout) (motorcycles rumble) (men shout) (suspenseful music) - [Frankie] Cesar was right, ese. You can't trust anybody, not even your best friends. - We had to pretend we hate each other. - [Frankie] Even these fuckers, they're gonna end up killing each other but I'll save them time, holmes. I'm gonna kill them first. - What if he thinks you both deserve a bigger cut? - It's about time. Hey, Frankie! - [Frankie] Don't fuck with a Mexican, ese, you'll get pregnant. (crowd shouts) - Hey don't anybody move or the priest gets it. - I don't care. You die tonight. - Let's do him. - [Frankie] (speaks Spanish) It was about time. - Frankie! - [Frankie] I don't think I'll ever enjoy somebody's death more than these, ese. - Keys, sir. - But of course, ese. - [Frankie] You're gonna die, motherfuckers. - I got something for you, Frankie. (exciting music) - No, please, let him go, there's been enough killing, let him go. - Padre, there's gonna be a lot of killing. - Not the kid. - Let him go. If you don't, you'll be just like him, let him get out of the barrio. You guys gotta let him go. - Take him, Cesar! - You got him, Cesar, take him. - No, please, no more killing. - [Man] Take him, you got him, shoot him! - [Man] Take him. - [Frankie] Open it, holmes, I'm waiting. - Fuck! (gun pops) (Frankie groans) (men laugh) (suspenseful music) - Go, get out of here. - I'm taking a hostage, man. (men shout) - Get out of here! (men shout) - Stay out of our barrio. - Don't you worry, I don't ever-- - Just go! - Because you are shit. The barrio beat you, now get out of here. (Juice laughs) (gun pops) (energetic jazz music) - Cesar! I got a gift for you, man, These guys kidnapped Tim! - [Man] Fuck you, man! (crowd shouts) - Shoot the motherfuckers, man. - [Man] Don't push your luck, get out of here. (men shout) - Fuck that little guy. (guns pop) - [Ben] If bullets don't go in, I guess they don't come out either, sometimes too much money can be dangerous. (Frankie groans) - [Frankie] Done for, the barrio. The homies and all that bullshit (groans). Cesar was right, ese. We're nothing but freaky puppets. (gun clangs) - I love you, Dad. - You saved the barrio. - No, Ben, we saved the barrio. (Ben and Father Joe cheer) - [Ben] We are the new generation and we have changed our barrio. I wish all the barrios changed like ours. (uplifting music) (Latin-inspired upbeat music) (exciting music)
