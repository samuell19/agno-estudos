Richard! Oh, wonderful show. I understand the artist died just after you signed him. Yes. Such a shock. Terrible, really. He was such a difficult young man. So talented, so tortured. - We-- - Stop whining, Richard. I happen to know that his works have tripled in value since he died and you're making a killing. What happened to him? Someone broke into his loft and beat him to death with a hammer. It's absolu--absolutely tragic. You are so terrible, Richard. [laughs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Some people I know just came in. I must go say hello. Excuse me. [laughs] Now that's what I call a caring guy. Who, Richard? Ugh, isn't he awful? So, Harold, what do you do? I'm a producer. Really? Have you ever done any hardcore pornography? I'm in television. I see that now, you're very short. You know what you can do with that, lady? You can... [whispers indistinctly] That is the most vulgar proposition I've heard all day. Why don't we go to my place and find out if it's humanly possible? Dallas! What on Earth? It's been 20 years! Hello, Ulrike. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend? Well, I would, but I can't remember his name. Harold Cohen. How about those Dodgers, Harold? Harry here wants to try something really disgusting on me. So, why don't you make yourself comfortable? [Harold] It's Harold. [sultry music] Take those clothes off, Harold! [chuckles] Oh, you're such a plump and juicy little mister. - [Ulrike growls] - [Harold screaming] Dallas, come and get it. [Dallas snarls] - [Dallas growls] - [loud buzzing] [lightning crackles] If I'd known you were coming, I would have found someone larger. So, you need any help cleaning up this mess? Oh, don't bother, darling. I use a service. You're joking. It's run by the Count. So, how is the old monster? Oh, still the same. But, if you are smart, you will avoid any confrontation. I'm sure his feelings have not softened towards you. Made any new bloodsuckers while I've been away? The Count hasn't let us work the change in years. But there is this trashy little female running around in Hollywood, posing as a prostitute. If anybody knows anything about her, they aren't talking. [body cracking] What's she like? Why are you so interested? I'm always interested in new faces. They call her the Hollywood Slasher. And the Count isn't concerned? Well, of course he's concerned, but hey, you know, what is he going to do? She keeps escaping his people. I hear it's driving him crazy. I'll just bet. Dallas, [clearing throat] please. [loud buzzing] [lightning crackles] [Nico panting] [Nico groans] - [upbeat funky music] - Yo, baby! Wanna talk to you for a little bit. Hey, listen. I feel like shit and I'm in a hurry. Yeah, I can see that, baby, but it's all good. I got a little something-something for you. - [vomiting] - [woman screams] Fuck. [elegant orchestral music] Excuse me, I'm looking for a young man. He's about 20 years of age. Probably came in her last night, no? What is your party's name, sir? I don't know, he uses so many different names. I'll tell you, he has extraordinarily white skin. Can't help you without a name, sir. You don't understand, this man has all sorts of names! The point is that he is dangerous! He is not 20! He's ancient! Sir, would you please lower your voice? You're telling me, Dr. Van Helsing from Vienna, to lower his voice? [speaking German] Sir, you'll have to leave the premises now. Dr. Van Helsing has to leave the-- These people can take over the entire world for God's sakes! We are in danger! They are vampires! You hear me? These people are demons, I'm talking about! They control the international press! They control the international banking! They drink blood! [upbeat music] [both purring] The ad is: "Wanted, a strong and brave young man who's not afraid, brave, B-R-A-V-E, who's not afraid to get his hands dirty in a cause that is holy." Holy like church. Ho--H-O-L-Y! [upbeat jazz music] [chuckles] [all] Surprise! [Dallas] Vincent! Panthia! Richard, how are you? - Lovely to see you. - Panthia, you look lovely as ever. And how is the little one? Well. He just moved. - Did you feel it? - I think so. How she loves that baby. How long have you been expecting now? Oh, 115 years of joy. Yeah, thank God she can't have the fucking thing. - [Dallas laughs] - How long are you gonna be in town for? - I'm not sure. - I've just found the most wonderful house in North Hollywood. A home for battered wives. Perhaps you'd like to join me for a bloody massacre? God, you're still one sick fuck of a vampire, Vincent. Well, why don't I pick you up next week, and we'll have an evening of fun. I'm going to slip into something much more comfortable. And then we'll all go out and we'll celebrate Dallas's return to LA. - Ah. - Yes? [laughs] [chattering indistinctly] [mysterious music] No! [yelps] [group laughs] This is Dr. Van Helsing. I'm watching them. I didn't know there was this many involved. It's a larger concentration. I don't know how the Institute overlooked it. I'm going to try to gauge and investigate the extent of this infestation. And God help us all, huh? [crickets chirping] [upbeat dance music] [man] I have a feeling it was a waste. - [man 2] No! - It was a waste! [upbeat dance music] LA's become quite a mecca for our type, Dallas. - [Richard laughs] - [woman whimpering] Ah, this is really something! [woman screams] There's never been anything quite like it. Oh, excuse me, love. [screams] [woman screams] [Richard growls] [Richard laughs] - [woman screams] - [Richard growls] - [cage rattling] - [woman screams] [music continues] No! I'm an attorney! You can't do this! Stop! I'll sue every last one of you! No! Let me go! Please! No! [screams] Two black and tan. [Ulrike laughs] [man screams] - Hello. - [group screams] [attorney screams] Ooh, is he Italian? I was wanting Italian tonight. [all screaming] Shit. Hello, wanker. [Dallas] What do you want? Me master would like to have a word with you. - I'll be right back. - Mm. [Dallas] Hello, Count. It's been a long time. What do you want in my lovely city? Well, I'm just here on a visit. Visit? I'll give you three days to enjoy the city and see the sights. After that, I want you to slither back into the rancid, putrid hole that you crawled out from. I hadn't heard I'd been exiled. Are you going to let this impertinent ass ruin such a wonderful dinner? Shut up. [Richard] Dallas! Something wrong old boy? [music continues] Dallas, what is wrong? Is it the Count? Something going on? Dallas had words with the Count. Shit. I think we'd better get out of here, then. I'll go get Vincent and Panthia. All right. Pinkie. Thank you. Look, everyone hates me and it's all because of that Nazi Van Helsing. Well, it takes time for people to forget, Dallas, but they do, they do. 30 years, 30 fucking years of putting up with the whispers and the sidelong glances. You know, I didn't have a choice, all right? Have I ever said otherwise? - [upbeat music] - [people screaming] [saw buzzing] [screaming] All right, get in. It's very interesting, they come in and out of this big building that's some kind of an establishment. I don't know, maybe club or something. Evidently, it's popular.

Yeah, right. You don't even know me. I know there's a whole bunch of bad characters out there ready to kill you. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna make them wish they was never born. That won't do you any good. There's a powerful Count out there that wants you dead. He uses mortals for security. Mortals, hear me? Now, you've killed a few. Next time, you'll be up against vampires just like us. You won't stand a chance. I don't get it. What did I ever do to this Count guy? Everyone's afraid you're gonna get arrested. You know what will happen then? The whole world will know vampires exist. And the human race will hunt us down like rats. So, to us, you're dangerous. Yeah, well, you know something? I am dangerous.

I mean, hey, if you don't wanna talk about it, it's all right. No, that's all right. It's all right, it's just nearly 20 years ago, there was this vampire. And he wanted revenge and he chose the most heinous and cowardly way, you know, to do it to my crippled son. Hans. What he do? He held out false hope he'd walk again. He plied him with lies and he seduced him. And then, finally, he made him one of them. So, he made your boy a vampire? [Van Helsing] Ja. His mother tried to hide the facts from me, but every night, she would go to visit the cemetery, visit his grave and then she wouldn't come back until dawn. Then, one night, I followed her, and she went into the mausoleum the Van Helsings have always had for their final resting place. I watched in horror as my Frieda entered the mausoleum. The sun was going down and I knew I only had a few moments to act. I knew that our Hans was not our Hans anymore. He was now a monstrous evil, with a doting mother to watch over him. Hey, Frieda, get out! Out, out, go! Out, get out! You have to-- - No! - Out of here! Father, no! Father, no! No! - [Hans groaning] No! - [Frieda sobbing] No! [sobbing] No! [Van Helsing] Die! Mama, Mama! [groans] It hurts! No! So, what happened to your old lady? She drank, uh, drank rat poison. That's some cold shit, man. And the vampire who did it is in this city now. No shit? And I have sworn I kill him. I have sworn, on the soul of my son, I destroy him. So help me God. You live in there? Yeah, you happy now? - No, are you? - I'm not complaining. I'd like you to tell me your memories of your life before all this. Before what? Before you became what you are now. That's a hard question. You know, this place is a rat hole. Yeah, well, you know, it's my rat hole, okay? Come on, let's go. Will you relax? If I go with you, you promise you'll bring me right back here whenever I want? I promise. Ulrike. Ulrike. Richard. Ulrike. Dead woman. Meet the Hollywood Slasher. [Ulrike snarls] Are you insane, bringing this creature here? [chuckles] Calm yourself, Ulrike. Well, well. Hello, my dear. Very nice to meet you at last. Dallas, I knew you were irresponsible, but I think you might be mentally unbalanced. Let me kill her now before the Count finds out and destroys us all. Oh, yeah, you fucking bitch? How about I blow your head off right now? Now, now, ladies. Don't fight. Oh, you are insane. This creature must die. Look, Dallas, you promised that you'd take me home whenever I wanted. [Dallas] Would you just-- just wait a minute, all right? Ulrike, I really need your help with this. Very well. If you are going to bring her here, I insist you bathe her. She smells like one of those disgusting homeless people. And I will not have it. You do need a bath, kid. Give me that! It'll be all right. When did you last bathe, monster? Oh, look at these filthy, disgusting rags! She probably died in them. Oh, well, that's great. What am I supposed to wear? Oh, don't worry, I'll find you something much better. So, how old are you? I don't know! Look at this, Richard. What do you think? [Richard] Oh, they're cute little things. I'd say she's been with us 20, 25 years-- Do you mind getting your fucking fingers out of my mouth? - 20, 25 years. - [Richard laughing] Hmm. With the cigars, out! Go! Okay, my little icky-pooh. Now I clean you for real. I have a lot of experience with this. In Germany, we do it all the time. - Sit up. - [Nico groans] [Richard] I like your young lady. Of course, you Yankee doodle Air Force types get all the hot, young trumpets, don't ya? You know, I haven't flown anything since I was shot down in '43. Really? Well, it's lucky the local vampires needed your help getting their green cards. [chuckles] How time flies. You know, these are rather nice. - Cuban? - A Cuban seed. Nicaraguan. Pretty cool Jag, you and the missus seem to be doing well. Eh, all right, I suppose. Although, if it hadn't of been for the equity, Panthia and I hadn't those Florida condos, we'd have had to start again from scratch. What, did you take out a second mortgage? Well, I had to when I... Hello. [gentle orchestral music] When I bought the gallery. Thanks to stinking LA nouveau, we paid it off this year. Dallas, here is your child. Look at you. I wanna go home now, okay? It's gonna be sunrise soon. Dallas, we need to talk. I'll be right back. I know you are responsible for that creature in there. Do not even try and deny it. Am I missing something here? Can't you see the way he looks at her? So? Oh, Richard, you are so dense. He made her. He is the one responsible for turning that little cunt into the vampire she is today. How can you possibly know that? Because I know. All right? Oh, Dallas. You've been a very naughty boy, haven't you? I don't want her to know, all right? [Richard chuckles] Burn her, Dallas. Nobody's burning anyone. I fucking mean it. [Richard] You have to admit, Dallas, you've put us all in danger by bringing her here. [indistinct chattering] If anyone asks, you can just say she's visiting from Europe. - [Richard laughs] - Europe? That little white trash thing? And what are we supposed to do, huh, when she starts killing the bellboys and draw attention to herself? She won't do that, okay? [heavenly music] [upbeat music] [dog barking] [snarls] Wake up. Look. They're here. [Time Bomb] I ain't never seen no vampires carrying no gun, Doc. Maybe you oughta bring some heavier weapons on this, you know what I'm saying? It's all right, when the sun comes up, then it's our turn. Fuck. Did you see a young girl just now? Sans clothes and carrying a pistol? [dramatic music] Do you know how dangerous that was, walking through the street like that? Your friends are all a bunch of snobs, you know that? Motherfucking wetbacks with their big-ass words, running around telling American citizens what to do. Look, the sun's gonna come up soon. Well, what do you want me to do about it? I have to get in there with you. I guess you're probably not used to this, huh? But if you're too hoity-toity, you can always stay out here and sizzle. [Dallas] You don't even know how long you've been walking the streets, do you? Don't you wanna have friends? Someone you can talk to? People you can feel comfortable with? [Nico] I do okay. [Dallas] Catch a movie, go dancing? - [Nico] You go dancing? - [Dallas] Sure, I go dancing. [Nico] I'd like to go dancing sometime. [Dallas] Well, maybe I'll take you one night. [mysterious music] Hey. Yo, Doc. She could be anywhere, man. Yeah. We find the little bloodsucker, I tell you, I'll drive a stake through her heart. And that would be absolutely [speaks German]. Yo, don't you think there's too many of these freaks for us to be handling them by ourselves? What, you losing your courage? Nah. I'm just thinking, you know, maybe it's a good idea to call in some of the brothers, you know what I'm saying, to help out. Brothers? What--what's brothers, a new religious order? Yeah, the royal order of the Crips. I don't understand. The only thing I know royal order, or anything like that, is St. Crispus. Nah, man, it's an American thing. Just chill, all right? Oh, come on, you can't stand there. We have to move! You want to catch something, you know you have to pursue. I mean, vengeance has to be relentless! Come on, we must move. [Time Bomb] Let me ask you a question, man. - What? - Think we could fight her if we had to? A vampire? They are superhuman. You can't fight them. You can kill them with a stake through the heart, but fight, physically, forget it. You couldn't do it. [Time Bomb] We're gonna wind up with our balls in a schnitzel [indistinct] this motherfucker. Vampire killers. Where did you get schnitzel from? [dramatic music] [gun clicks] - [gun firing] - [bullets ricocheting] [upbeat rock music] [indistinct shouting] - What the fuck is that? - Oh, that's him! I'm sure that's him! - Let's go! Get the fuck outta here! - That's Dallas! I'll get you, Dallas! - I get you! - [Time Bomb] Come on! - [gun clicking] - Fuck. [music continues] You can never come back here now. What are you talking about? That old man is Dr. Van Helsing. He's a professional vampire killer. You shithead, this is all your fault! I'm fucking homeless now! You hit me. Look, I don't have time to play games with you, all right? So unless you wanna die, you're gonna have to do everything I tell you from here on out, understand? Okay. Fine. Now go put on those clothes. Fine. [elegant orchestral music] [knocking on door] Richard. [knocking on door] Dallas. Come in. Ah, I was wondering when you'd be bringing-- - Well, well. - your little protégé over. Well, this is a surprise. Van Helsing's here in town. Oh, shit. Van Helsing? Here? In LA? Yeah, and he's not alone. He's got some guy working for him. Stranger, I've never seen him before. That wasn't no stranger. That was a Crip. Some sort of local youth club. Whatever. Van Helsing knows where she sleeps now, so I've gotta find a place for her that's safe. I'm afraid to leave her at Ulrike's. She's too unstable. But it would be the greatest pleasure for Richard and I to have this little creature with us. Am I right, Richard? Oh, but look, she's so precious. Oh, my dear, you're going to need an entire makeover. You have to understand that image, ah-ah, is everything here. So come along. You can call me Aunt Panthia. She's been pining for that fucking rugrat for so long, I think my wife's finally adopted your protégé. I've got to do something about Van Helsing. Well, if you do find him, then what? You think I'm incapable of killing him. Well, you tell me. He's dead meat. You two can forget about Van Helsing for now because if you really wanna save a woman, this girl needs to go shopping with me, because when I say I go shopping, I mean it. I go shopping. Oh, Dallas, you got any money? Please? And Richard, [indistinct]? [Dallas] I don't know how much I got here. Ah, thank you. Not to worry, dear. It's just money. Will you join us? [upbeat music] [Richard] Be still my beating trousers. [growls] Yo, Panthia, you spent all our money yet? Oh, I can assure you she will have. It was worth every penny. - [Richard] Mm-hm. - Take a seat, please. [Richard] Mm-hm. Ready to see the beauty? - Voila. - [gentle orchestral music] Two thumbs up. [both] Way up. [woman] Um, you don't have to put her in those green shoes with the blue shirt and the shiny eye shadow. - It's just too much. - Hey, listen, if you're gonna talk to me, then why don't you say it straight to my face? [laughs] Excuse me? Ah, well, what do you think now? You like it? Of course I do. My dear, you're so delicious. All peaches and cream. Thank you, Aunt Panthia. What a pleasure. [Panthia moans] Excuse me, is anybody going to be paying for anything? Would you like to give me your credit card? 'Cause I have to close in five minutes. I have a party to go to. Oh, go on, kill the fucking bitch. Go on, rip her fucking lungs out. Come on, you little rascal. [roaring] [screaming] Jolly good. - [Nico roaring] - [Richard chuckles] [continues roaring] - [continues roaring] - [Panthia] Oh! - Darling. - [Nico roars] [panting] Darling, this is not the way we kill. You know, this is a very talented young lady. Well, I'm afraid that this outfit is ruined. [continues panting] Hello? Yes, could we have a pick up at 1123 Hollywood Boulevard? [Nico roars] Yes. Yes, credit card will be fine, thank you. Could you come around the back? I don't know. This is a strange place to meet a brother. Don't worry about it, Doc. - What's up, cuz? - Yo, yo! This is the guy I was telling you about, Dr. Van Helsing. Doc, these are my fellas right here. This right here's my man Soda Pop. What's up, Doc? - Soda Pop? - Yeah, Soda Pop. Right here's my man, Li'l Monster. [shotgun clacks] [Li'l Monster] What's shaking, Gramps? Little Monster, yeah. And last but not least, my main man, Trigger. What's up, Gramps? You know why they call me Trigger? After all this, I don't have the slightest idea. 'Cause I'm the illest gunslinger in the set. [Soda Pop] Why you lying, man? [Li'l Monster] 'Cause he look like Mr. Ed. Hey, man, shut up, with your receding hairline. Please, please, please! No, no, please! Let's not have any argument. This is very serious business here. We're dealing with vampires. Now listen to me carefully. Bullets can stop a vampire, but not destroy him, you understand? Garlic, in this case, is stronger than bullets. Man, ain't no garlic stronger than no guns. Yo, yo, the Doc knows what he's talking about. Chill. ["Psycho Dwarf 2" by The Beatnuts] Oh, please, please, stop the music! Will you please stop it?

With a good commercial lubricant, we can go for hours. You know, Dallas, you're a real card. You oughta be dealt with. [low music] You ever watch any Christopher Lee movies? Chris--Bruce Lee. Listen, can't I just wait in the car? I'm gonna freak out if I go in there. No, you won't, trust me. This is a great place to get a late dinner. [man] So, you see, I've been concentrating on nonlinear stuff mostly, but I do have this great screenplay that Steven Seagal, he'd be so good for, I'm telling you. He'd be perfect. Really, is he an actor? No, dear, not at all. Oh, who's this? Oh, this is Alan, Dallas. He's an author. He's very intelligent, and look at those lashes. Isn't he delicious? [growls] Yeah, he's a good-looking kid. [Richard chuckles] What did you say to her? Oh, my little dear, I told her to go to the toilet and wash the blood off her face. - [Panthia chuckles] - What's she talking about? Oh, you don't want to know. Woman's problems. Hey, that's a nice outfit you got there. Thanks, my aunt gave it to me. Oh, yeah? You got any eye shadow on you? I'm totally out. I'm Rachel. Hi, I'm Nico. [Rachel] Hey. - Are you from around here? - Yeah, I guess. Yeah, me too. So where do you go to school at? - I don't. - [Rachel] That's so cool. You know, I wanted to drop out of high school too. My mom and dad, they're just total fucking assholes. Don't get it. Would you ever wanna go out together sometime? Yeah, sure. Exchange numbers. Okay. You know, I really like your hair, I have to say. - Hey! - Like your hair too. Have you been waiting out here this whole time? I'm just keeping my eye on you, okay? Oh, this is my friend, Dallas. Oh, what a lovely little girl. Is she coming with us? Oh, no, absolutely not. She has things to do, yeah. Oh, then say goodbye, darling. Oh, but, Aunt Panthia, we just got here. We have to go. Don't worry about it, all right? I'll call you tomorrow. Really? You mean it? Of course, I mean it. Oh, wow! [moans, giggles] [chuckles] - [Panthia] Jealous, Dallas? - No, I'm not jealous. - You're not gay are you? - No, no, no, just bi-curious. [dramatic music] [Count] Dallas. And you are? She's just a friend from out of town. Hello, my little dove. I know who you are. You're that bag of shit who wants to kill me. - Ah. - [laughs] What a vicious little child. Can I have her? He doesn't look so badass to me. And what do they call you, my child? You ever hear of the Hollywood Slasher? You bring this being here to our place of recreation and sanctuary? Don't look at him, fuckwad, look at me! No, no, no, no. She's just a little baby. You. We'll settle this little matter later. You and I. And you. What, are you leaving? [Count] Yes, fuckwad. Fuckwad, I love that. Well, that went rather well. What should we do for an encore? Shoot ourselves in the fucking head? Come on, he didn't seem so tough. Would somebody shut that disgusting little shit the fuck up? Do you have any idea what you just did? - I'm talking to you! - Oh, screw that piece of shit! Dallas, you have to get the girl and leave the country tonight. He's right, we should get out of here. Oh, I should leave the country? Well, I got news for you, I'm an American citizen, and no fucking foreign bag of shit's gonna run me outta my own goddamn country! - Bravo. - [Nico] No offense to you two. I didn't mean you guys. None taken, dearest. Hey, your friends are, uh, they're kinda weird. Oh, well, you should see them naked. [upbeat music] Come along, everyone. Daddy's gonna take you all for a lovely little ride. [Time Bomb] You getting paid, right, motherfuckers? [Trigger] I ain't seen no money yet! [indistinct] 'cause I'm tired of this shit, man. [Van Helsing] I'm sure there's a gas station on a busy street like this, you know? [speaks German] Push, push! [crickets chirping] [dramatic music] Vincent's dead. - [whimpers] - [somber music] We had a date. [Ulrike crying] I went to his house. I found him in the bed. [Richard] This is definitely the work of Van Helsing. [sobs] That bad, bad, Dr. Van Helsing. You should have killed him when you had the chance! - [Richard] Shh, shh, shh. - [crying] His soul is free now. - [music continues] - [muffled upbeat rock music] Hey, what's your problem? One of our dearest friends is dead in the trunk of a car outside. Yeah, well, what do you want me to do? Start crying? You're empty inside. You have no history. That's why you're not afraid of anything. Look, what you see, that's me, okay? If you don't like it, then too fucking bad! - Come on, we're leaving. - What do you mean we're leaving? The sun will be up soon! I said we're leaving, now move your ass! Why'd you bring me here? You don't remember this place. Dallas, will you take me home please? It's gonna be all right. Trust me. - [tense music] - I've been here before, haven't I? When? When was I here? Everything will be clear to you. Just have a little patience. [Nico] How come you know so much about me? When the time comes, I'll tell you everything. [Nico] Oh, I'm--I'm scared, Dallas. [Dallas] Come on. Everything's gonna be okay. [Nico] Oh, I've got such a real bad feeling about this. [knocking on door] [woman] It's three in the goddamn morning! Who's out there? [Nico] That voice, oh, my God, that voice. Mom? [gentle music] Mom, it's me, Nico. This kid here says she's Nico. [chuckles] Yeah, and I'm Abraham Lincoln. I am Nico, goddammit. You know, that's a pretty sick joke, miss. Our Nico ran off more than 20 years ago. You're saying you can't remember my face? Well, ought to after doing all that sex shit to me when I was little! Meet my stepfather. Where you been all these years, Nico? Are you nuts, Wanda? That can't be Nico. I ought to know my own daughter, George. Oh, you got to be kidding. Nico--she'd have to be 40 years old. Listen, I came to see my mama, George, so why don't you just shut your big fat fucking mouth? This is my trailer and I will speak - when I please. - My real daddy bought this trailer, so why don't you just shut your mouth before I shut it for you permanent? Why'd you come back here, Nico? I brought her back so she'd remember. Have you had amnesia, honey? Is that where you been all these years? She's probably here to ask you for money. Be still, George. You get fresh, Wanda, and you're gonna be sorry. You lay one hand on her, George, and you're the one who's gonna be sorry, and I mean it! I think it's time you all cleared out. Just say the word, kid. [sighs] Kill him. - [Dallas snarls] - No! No! No! - [neck cracks] - [Wanda] No, don't touch me! Go away! No! No! No, no! You're some kind of demon! No! He ain't gonna beat on you no more, Mama. It'll be okay. You're not my baby! - No, no! - Mom, it's okay! It's me, Nico! Go back to Hell! [sobs] You never loved me, anyway! - [Wanda wailing] - You never fucking loved me! You were a terrible mother! I wish I never came back here! [Wanda sobbing] - Are you okay? Talk to me. - I don't want to talk about it, okay? [Nico crying] [somber music] [tense music] [sobs] Can you just please get me out of here, Dallas? We've got company. And they're scared. Can you smell it? [dramatic music] [Nico roars] [gunfire] [grunting] [guns firing] Shit! Bitch! [groans] You shot me. Shit! You shot me. You dirty little bitch. Me master's gonna burn you very slowly. And you, you bloody wanker, I'm gonna burn you me self. [Dallas] You wouldn't dare. Vampire doofus flambé. [fire roars] - Come on! - [screaming] Blimey! [screaming] Oh, shit! [screaming] It's hot! It's hot! [groans] [upbeat orchestral music] I knew Van Helsing's institute was in Vienna, so I figured I'd meet the legend himself and put his lights out. I figured I'd get him through his son, Hans. You killed his kid? No, I didn't kill his kid. He was smart and witty. We hit it off and ended up becoming real good friends. And when the opportunity came to kill the father, I couldn't do it. Out of loyalty to Hans. You're a real sap, Dallas. You know that? No wonder everyone hates you. Do you want to hear the rest of this, or do you want to gimme a bunch of shit? Both. Continue. The kid had a genetic disorder that was killing him, so I offered him a choice. You know, die from the disease, or become one of us. Cool. I figured Van Helsing's attitude towards our kind would change. You know, seeing how his kid was a vampire and all. What a minute. You mean Van Helsing offed his own kid? Put a stake right through his heart like it was nothing. Man, he is one sick fuck. [music continues] [operatic music playing] [Ulrike whispering] It's going to be all right. No. Yes. Relax. [woman whimpers] [music continues] [sighs] [phone rings] Hello? Hi, Rachel, it's me, Nico. I can't believe you called. Yeah, I'd love to go out. Um, oh, it's 447 Martel. Yeah, I'll meet you outside. Okay, I'll be waiting. Bye. My friend's coming over. My friend's coming over! My friend's coming over! That's wonderful, my love. Are you going to kill her? No! No! No, fucking way! Uh-uh. - [bright music] - [woman vocalizing] Hey, girlie, girl, get in. It's so cool of you, coming over. Of course, you know, I said I would. [ominous music] Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. What do I have to do to get you to leave the girl alone? [chuckles] Why don't you try sticking your thumb up your ass and doing a little dance? [laughs] Then, [chuckles] maybe I'll think about it. Look, she's young and she doesn't know anything, but I can teach her. She's already learning. She's learning. She's learning. Oh, and I bet you're quite the teacher, Dallas. I don't want her to learn. I want her dead. Damn you! Ah, ah, ah, ah. Look, she's no threat to us. [Count] Dallas. You will bring her to me. If you don't, not only will I kill you, I will gut you like a pig. And everyone that you think you love, will die screaming. Can I have her? Goodbye, Dallas. It's coming, mate. [laughs] - [upbeat rock music] - [laughing] [can hissing] [indistinct] chattering] [group laughs] What do I do? Don't tell me you've never huffed paint before. Put the bag in your mouth and breathe like a pig. [can hissing] Inhale. Don't get any paint on you face, though, 'cause it never comes off. [group laughs] Fuck. What do you think? You like that?

I don't make propositions with vampires. What would you say if I told you I could give you Count Dracula himself? I don't believe it. Is he here in Los Angeles? Where? Let her go and I'll take you to him. [Van Helsing] Do you think I'm just gonna let you walk away? No, no, I'm not that stupid, but if you don't let her go, you'll never get Dracula. [Nico groaning] I don't understand. You mean to tell me that you are willing to sacrifice your life for this thing? Don't do it, Dallas! [panting] That's the deal. Yo, Trigger's over here dying, man! [lightning crackles] You dumb bitch, you messed up Trigger! Tell him to leave her alone, Van Helsing. Leave her alone! Leave her alone! You got a smoke, honey? Oh, man. I feel so sick. Oh, me too. Think Trigger's gonna be okay? If he ain't, his mom's gonna cut our balls off. You're such a scumbag, Van Helsing! Dallas should have killed you when he had the chance! Would you shut her up? It's a free country, she can say whatever she wants. I see, it's a free country, and you can tum my boy into a vampire! He did it to save his life! - Shut her up! - [Nico] No, I won't shut up! And the next time you tell me to shut up, I'm gonna rip you a new asshole! You touch her and you won't get the Count. [Van Helsing] Well, then, control her! I'll take care of it.
