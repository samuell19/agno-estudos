Senator Craig Cole was found dead This is Kaime Stroot-- Senator Craig Cole was found dead Senator Craig Cole was found dead - I had this idea in January of 2016. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" We're gonna shoot a movie, you're the lead, - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" But you can't know anything. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" - I want to do something where - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" You have to become the character. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" Where, once we start rolling, we don't talk to you. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" Only the characters talk to you. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" I was like, "what, what, what do you mean, - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "I can't know anything? - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "What's the story." - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "No, can't tell you. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "Can't tell you. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "You just got to, do you want to do it? - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "Are you interested?" - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "Uh, yeah. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "I mean, it sounds interesting, - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" "But I don't know how this is going to be." - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" And, it kind of, you know, birthed from there. - And he called me and he said, "I got it!" - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, we were actually at a film festival, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, and he had mentioned this idea of yeah, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, just have it not be scripted, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, having it be total improv, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, and then having it be in addition to that - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, something where like the lead actress, Shannon, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, wouldn't know anything, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, and she would have to learn what's going on - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, over the course of the movie, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, just as the audience is. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, - I got really excited to make this movie, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, because we were doing something - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, that had never been done in film before. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, So, we had several challenges going in - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, that we were going to shoot the movie in less than 24 hours, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, that we were gonna shoot it consecutively, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, that it was going to have an improvisational performance - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, in the movie. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, - We're gonna set aside some rules - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, before we go through this. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, You four people are the only people allowed - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, to talk to Shannon when we're shooting. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, Once we pull the bag over her head, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, and she wakes up from her sleep, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, none of the crew, producers, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, nobody is allowed to talk to her unless it's you guys, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, the ancillary characters, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, or somebody who's not involved with the film at all. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, - It was more of an experiment than a movie. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, And so, throughout the entire bit of it, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, I felt more of like a more of like, - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, more of like a scientist than a filmmaker. - When Bobby first approached me with this concept, A social scientist, kind of, figuring out what would cause people A social scientist, kind of, to make the decisions that they make. A social scientist, kind of, - The process of the film, A social scientist, kind of, improvising everything just kept you on edge A social scientist, kind of, the entire time, from the moment we started, A social scientist, kind of, to the moment it was over. A social scientist, kind of, Just, kind of holding on to the back of a speeding vehicle, A social scientist, kind of, because you don't know what's going to happen, and you don't know how the other person's going to react. Because you don't know what's going to happen, And you have to be prepared for that moment, because you don't know what's going to happen, and you have to live up to that moment and keep it going. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - But when we're in it, you can't be the actor because you don't know what's going to happen, I mean you really can't, because you don't know what's going to happen, because you're responding. Because you don't know what's going to happen, It's not a, "Hey I have this line planned out." Because you don't know what's going to happen, No, you have to respond to whatever's happening. Because you don't know what's going to happen, In doing the response, because you don't know what's going to happen, I was responding to Blair being a real person. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - Prepping for this thing was kind of interesting because you don't know what's going to happen, because we didn't have a script. Because you don't know what's going to happen, We didn't know exactly where it was gonna go, because you don't know what's going to happen, so it was a full circle kind of preparation. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - So we spent some time walking through the steps because you don't know what's going to happen, of, you know, where we needed to help lead Blair. Because you don't know what's going to happen, You know, ultimately we wanted to get her because you don't know what's going to happen, to this final, this final stop, because you don't know what's going to happen, where she can make a decision, because you don't know what's going to happen, and it was up to us to lead her along that path, because you don't know what's going to happen, and you know, and get her there, because you don't know what's going to happen, make sure she trusted us, make sure she, because you don't know what's going to happen, you know, she followed us and we got her to that final, because you don't know what's going to happen, that final step. Because you don't know what's going to happen, She's going to be right, right there because you don't know what's going to happen, - She's going to be at the corner of the table top. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - We're going to be in the corner over here. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - Okay, so this is a quiet conversation. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - And just got to see how they would react because you don't know what's going to happen, in a situation where they didn't know what was happening. Because you don't know what's going to happen, There was no second takes. Because you don't know what's going to happen, There was no rehearsals for her. Because you don't know what's going to happen, It was just a really cool idea. Because you don't know what's going to happen, And add the fact that we shot it all in one night, because you don't know what's going to happen, was really succinct and efficient. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - I was going to ask Bobby about this. Because you don't know what's going to happen, I was thinking that when they drive, because you don't know what's going to happen, they should drive down that street and either you, because you don't know what's going to happen, or you run out into the middle of the street, because you don't know what's going to happen, and we just catch them leaving. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - Again, everything that ended up in the film, because you don't know what's going to happen, is the first time Shannon's doing it because you don't know what's going to happen, and the last time she did it. Because you don't know what's going to happen, - And I'll never forget that moment, because you don't know what's going to happen, watching her walk outside, because you don't know what's going to happen, realizing she has no idea what's happening. Because you don't know what's going to happen, She doesn't even know where she is. Because you don't know what's going to happen, And then we started following her, because you don't know what's going to happen, and at some moment, because you don't know what's going to happen, I don't know how long we had been walking after her, she looked back at us, and the look on her face was fear. I don't know how long we had been walking after her, Real fear. And she took off running, and I took off running after her And she took off running, and it was like man, it is on. And she took off running, - Yeah, so this film really was a total experiment, And she took off running, not only in the way that it was captured, And she took off running, but in the process and what we were trying to achieve, And she took off running, because really the central focus of this is, And she took off running, everyone, myself and all the other characters, And she took off running, the secondary characters, trying to achieve their goals. And she took off running, - He is incorporating and putting the ball And she took off running, completely into Shannon's hands And she took off running, and she has to take that And she took off running, and drive the story forward, And she took off running, because of the nature of the concept. And she took off running, She'd been blindfolded and dropped into a scene And she took off running, and told to go and carry this thing until the end. And she took off running, So she's got to make all these different scenes And she took off running, and drive the plot forward in a 90-minute movie. And she took off running, So she's got to use all of her skills And she took off running, as an actress and use all of her talents as an actress And she took off running, to make this thing happen. And she took off running, But she's got to have a 100 % belief in Bobby that, And she took off running, you know, what she's doing is working. And she took off running, - So the process of the actual shoot was terrifying, And she took off running, in an amazing way. I didn't want to know anything. In an amazing way. I literally did not want to know anything, in an amazing way. So I asked to be blindfolded while I was getting dressed in an amazing way. In my costume and for my hair and makeup in an amazing way. And of course you're not blindfolded in an amazing way. When they're doing your makeup, in an amazing way. But there were no mirrors, in an amazing way. So I couldn't tell what colors, in an amazing way. What they were doing to my face or hair. In an amazing way. I really don't know much of anything about the project in an amazing way. I, the one thing I do know is that my character has retrograde amnesia. I, the one thing I do know - We take her to the location in sunglasses with her eyes closed and we walk her in to the room - We take her to the location in sunglasses that we're gonna start shooting in - We take her to the location in sunglasses and I sit her down in a chair, and I ask her, - We take her to the location in sunglasses "Do you trust me?" - We take her to the location in sunglasses and she laughs for a second, and I guess she's thinking, - We take her to the location in sunglasses "I guess we're really gonna do this" - We take her to the location in sunglasses and she says, "Yes," and I said, "Okay. - We take her to the location in sunglasses "Let's begin." - We take her to the location in sunglasses And we started. - We take her to the location in sunglasses Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - Yes. Do you trust me? Okay. Do you trust me? You ready? Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - Yes. Begin.
